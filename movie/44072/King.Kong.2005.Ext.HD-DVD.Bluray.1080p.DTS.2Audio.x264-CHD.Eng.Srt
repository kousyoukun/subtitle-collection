1
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:17,468
# I'm sitting on top of the world #

2
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:19,478
# I'm rolling along #

3
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,405
# Yes, rolling along #

4
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:27,953
# And I'm quitting the blues of the world #

5
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:30,512
# I'm singing a song #

6
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:33,150
# Yes, singing a song #

7
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:36,354
# Glory hallelujah! I just told the parson #

8
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,296
# "Hey, Par, get ready to call" #

9
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,559
# Just like Humpty Dumpty #

10
00:01:42,335 --> 00:01:44,200
# I'm gonna fall #

11
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:48,673
# And I'm sitting on top of the world #

12
00:01:48,741 --> 00:01:51,471
# I'm rolling along #

13
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,876
# Rolling along #

14
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:56,643
# Don't want any millions #

15
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,116
# I'm getting my share #

16
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:01,016
# I've only got one suit just one #.

17
00:02:01,087 --> 00:02:02,213
Move along.

18
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:04,313
# That's all I can wear #

19
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,858
# A bundle of money #

20
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,326
# Don't make me feel gay #

21
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,795
# A sweet little honey #

22
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:15,301
# Is making me say #

23
00:02:15,368 --> 00:02:19,805
# And I'm sitting, sitting on top, top of the world #

24
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:22,433
# I'm rolling along #

25
00:02:22,509 --> 00:02:25,637
# Rolling along #

26
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:30,172
# And I'm quitting, quitting the blues, blues of the world #

27
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,741
# I'm singing a song #

28
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,344
# Yes, singing a song #

29
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,549
# Glory hallelujah! I just told the parson #

30
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,355
# "Hey, Par, get ready to call" #

31
00:02:41,427 --> 00:02:43,258
# Just like Humpty Dumpty #

32
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:45,929
# I'm gonna fall #

33
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:50,834
# Yeah! I'm sitting on top, top of the world #.

34
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:52,026
Oh!

35
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,663
# I'm rolling along #

36
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,709
# Rolling along ##.

37
00:03:07,053 --> 00:03:09,988
That's a funny one. Isn't that funnier?

38
00:03:10,056 --> 00:03:11,284
It's hysterical, Manny.

39
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,756
As long as we're laughing...

40
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:14,258
we won't cry over the box office.

41
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:15,919
Talk about depressing.

42
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:19,522
Twenty girls in feather boas prancing around like circus ponies.

43
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,123
That's depressing.

44
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,533
I love a good chorus line.

45
00:03:25,572 --> 00:03:28,132
What's this? It's a play.

46
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:29,698
Who wrote it, Annie?

47
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,573
Some guy. Driscoll.

48
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,273
Driscoll.

49
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:35,211
From the Federal Theatre.

50
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:38,648
Don't knock it, honey. At least they got an audience.

51
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,254
It'll pick up. Isn't that right, Manny?

52
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:47,483
It always does.

53
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,486
See you tomorrow.

54
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:53,658
The trick is to start to build right from the back of your throat.

55
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,359
Works well out through the nose, too.

56
00:03:57,437 --> 00:03:59,234
Have you eaten today?

57
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,499
Oh...

58
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,871
I'm not hungry. Don't worry about me.

59
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:04,136
Hey.

60
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:07,174
You're all I've got.

61
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,878
Come on, take me to dinner.

62
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:12,878
Okay.

63
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,086
You think the kitchen will still be open on Third?

64
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:18,688
Soup and biscuits. Perfect.

65
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:27,692
Harry, what's going on?

66
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:32,233
Hey, open up! We work here. Not anymore, lady.

67
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:35,866
It's all right for you. We haven't had a paycheck in two weeks.

68
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,603
How we gonna eat?

69
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:40,802
They're not getting away with this! They just did.

70
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,314
Ann, it's no use.

71
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,313
The show, it's over. It's done.

72
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,382
I'm done.

73
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:52,552
I'm leaving, Annie.

74
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:56,319
I'm going back to Chicago.

75
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,788
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:59,899 --> 00:05:01,526
I'm sorry, Annie.

77
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,939
Ever since you were small, people been letting you down.

78
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,905
You gotta think of yourself now.

79
00:05:11,177 --> 00:05:13,771
You should try out for that part.

80
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,848
Oh, I know what you're thinking.

81
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:22,818
Every time you reach out for something you care about...

82
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,619
fate comes along and snatches it away.

83
00:05:26,292 --> 00:05:28,283
But not this time, Annie.

84
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,385
Not this time.

85
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,667
Oh, hello, Mr. Weston. Oh, jeez.

86
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,805
Look, miss, I told you already, call my office.

87
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:42,807
Leave your resume with my secretary.

88
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,935
Now, why would I want to do that when we can talk about it in person?

89
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,639
Because that's what a smart girl would do.

90
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,182
But I already sent you my resume. You returned it unopened.

91
00:05:50,249 --> 00:05:53,275
What can I say? Jack Driscoll's very
particular about who he works with.

92
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,014
Please, just an audition. That's all I'm asking.

93
00:05:55,088 --> 00:05:56,282
Jesus, you don't give up, do you?

94
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,914
Mr. Weston, I know this role backwards.

95
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,959
Well, that's too bad, 'cause we just gave the part to someone else.

96
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,427
I'm sorry, kid. The play is cast.

97
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,194
I know times are tough.

98
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,260
You want my advice?

99
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:14,665
Use what you got. You're not bad-looking.

100
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,369
A girl like you doesn't have to starve.

101
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,070
There's a new place. It just opened.

102
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:30,281
Now listen, princess, this gig ain't the Palace, you understand?

103
00:06:30,356 --> 00:06:33,348
Ask for Kenny K. Tell him I sent you.

104
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,051
Just play the date, take the money...

105
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:40,021
forget you was ever there.

106
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:12,096
How much more is there?

107
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:14,361
Another five reels.

108
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:16,065
Lights up.

109
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:25,341
This is it?

110
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:28,242
This is what we get for our $40,000, Denam?

111
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:29,941
Another one of your safari pictures?

112
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:33,110
You promised us romantic scenes with
Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie!

113
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:34,881
Come on, fellows, you know the deal.

114
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,546
We agreed to push Maureers start date...

115
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,180
so she could get her teeth fixed.

116
00:07:38,257 --> 00:07:41,090
It's not the principle of the thing, it's the money.

117
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,720
Carl, you've been in production for over two months.

118
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:46,458
Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna steam up the screen...

119
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,432
once we get them on the ship.

120
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:50,533
What ship?

121
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,431
The one that we hired to get to the location.

122
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,306
What location? Carl! You're supposed to be shooting on the back lot.

123
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:58,900
Yes, I understand that.

124
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,344
But, fellows, we're not making that film anymore...

125
00:08:01,414 --> 00:08:02,676
and I'll tell you why.

126
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,581
The story has changed. The script has been rewritten.

127
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,778
Life intervened.

128
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,246
I've come into possession of a map.

129
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,688
The sole surviving record of an uncharted island.

130
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,888
A place that was thought to exist only in myth.

131
00:08:19,198 --> 00:08:20,222
Until now.

132
00:08:20,299 --> 00:08:22,324
Whoa, Carl, slow down.

133
00:08:22,401 --> 00:08:23,732
Is he asking for more money?

134
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:26,397
He's asking us to fund a wild-goose chase.

135
00:08:26,472 --> 00:08:30,932
I'm talking about a primitive world never before seen by man.

136
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:35,103
The ruins of an entire civilization.

137
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,283
The most spectacular thing you've ever seen.

138
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:42,810
That's where I'll shoot my picture.

139
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,189
Will there be boobies?

140
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:49,655
Boobies?

141
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,825
Jigglies. Jiblonkas. Bazooms.

142
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,694
In my experience, people only go to these films...

143
00:08:55,768 --> 00:08:59,135
to observe the undraped form of the native girls.

144
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:00,772
What are you, an idiot?

145
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,037
You think they asked De Mille if he
would waste his time on nudie shots?

146
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,739
No! They respected the filmmaker. They showed some class.

147
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:11,271
Not that you'd know what that means, you cheap lowlife!

148
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:18,048
Would you step out for a moment, Carl?

149
00:09:29,268 --> 00:09:31,293
Zelman and Associates.

150
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,534
Give me that, quick.

151
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,232
You won't like it. It's non-alcoholic.

152
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:41,440
Preston, you have a lot to learn about the motion picture business.

153
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,977
Don't write him off, fellows. He's hotheaded, sure...

154
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:49,988
but Carl Denam's made some interesting pictures.

155
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,354
He's had a lot of near-success.

156
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:54,860
He's a preening self-promoter.

157
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:58,226
An ambitious no-talent. The guy's got "loser" written all over him.

158
00:09:58,297 --> 00:09:59,787
I understand your disappointment...

159
00:09:59,865 --> 00:10:01,992
He can't direct. He doesn't have the smarts.

160
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,866
He's washed up. It's all over town.

161
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:08,367
This jumped-up little turd's gonna bankrupt us.

162
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,272
The animal footage has value.

163
00:10:10,343 --> 00:10:12,777
Sure. Universal are desperate for stock footage.

164
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,245
Then sell it! Scrap the picture.

165
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,679
We got to retrieve something from this debacle.

166
00:10:22,588 --> 00:10:24,180
Get him back in.

167
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:26,815
Mr. Denam.

168
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:32,026
I want the cast and crew on the ship within the hour.

169
00:10:32,098 --> 00:10:33,224
No, Carl, you can't do this.

170
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,460
Tell them the studio pressured us into an early departure.

171
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,559
It's not ethical! What are they gonna do, sue me?

172
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,729
They can get in line.

173
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,237
I'm not gonna let them kill my film.

174
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:43,742
You realize that none of the camera equipment is on board?

175
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:46,607
We have no permits, no visas.

176
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,306
That's why I have you, Preston.

177
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:50,474
We have no insurance, we have no foreign currency.

178
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,483
In fact, we have no currency of any kind.

179
00:10:52,551 --> 00:10:53,540
He's there.

180
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,450
Get in there. Who's gonna pay for the ship?

181
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:56,613
Get in.

182
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:03,088
You get out of there! Come here! Step on it! Step on it!

183
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:06,222
Get out! You're finished, Denam!

184
00:11:09,135 --> 00:11:12,434
Don't worry, Preston. I've had a lot of practice at this.

185
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,067
I'm real good at crapping the crappers.

186
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,502
Red Label, 80% proof...

187
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:21,409
to be packed in a crate marked "lemonade."

188
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,538
You got it.

189
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:24,981
Tell Maureen she doesn't have six hours to put on her face.

190
00:11:25,051 --> 00:11:27,349
If she wants to be in this picture, she's gotta be on that boat.

191
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,048
She doesn't wanna be in this picture.

192
00:11:31,223 --> 00:11:33,817
Maureen pulled out. She pulled out?

193
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,986
Yesterday. I told you.

194
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:38,694
You said we were shooting in Singapore, right?

195
00:11:38,764 --> 00:11:40,755
That's what you told her.

196
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:43,827
Yeah, but we're not shooting in Singapore.

197
00:11:43,903 --> 00:11:48,203
God damn it, Preston, all you had to do was look her in the eye and lie.

198
00:11:48,474 --> 00:11:50,999
I got to get to a phone, talk to harlow's people.

199
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:52,510
She's unavailable.

200
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:55,411
Myrna Loy? Clara Bow? Mae West?

201
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,774
You'll never get her into a size four.

202
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:01,411
You gotta get a girl that'll fit into Maureers costumes.

203
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:04,983
Fay's a size four.

204
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,549
Yes, she is, but she's doing a picture with RKO.

205
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,628
Cooper, huh?

206
00:12:13,432 --> 00:12:15,161
I might have known.

207
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:17,936
You're not listening. We got to delay the shoot.

208
00:12:18,003 --> 00:12:20,471
Shut production down. We can't sail tonight.

209
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:21,972
Not an option. Carl.

210
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:23,508
I said I'd find a girl.

211
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,840
For God's sake, Preston, think like a winner!

212
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,744
Call Jack. I need that goddamn screenplay!

213
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,675
Defeat is always momentary.

214
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,711
What?

215
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:05,306
Hey! You gonna pay for this?

216
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,910
Excuse me.

217
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,447
Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

218
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,688
Vaudeville, huh?

219
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:26,788
I worked vaudeville once. That is a tough audience.

220
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,663
If you don't kill them fast, they kill you.

221
00:14:28,734 --> 00:14:30,201
Mr. Denam...

222
00:14:31,237 --> 00:14:32,226
I want you to know...

223
00:14:32,304 --> 00:14:35,102
that I'm not in the habit of accepting charity from strangers.

224
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:37,039
Or, for that matter...

225
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:39,667
taking things that don't belong to me.

226
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:41,645
It was obviously a terrible misunderstanding.

227
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,682
It's just that I haven't been paid in a while.

228
00:14:43,749 --> 00:14:47,150
That's awful. Anyway, Ann... May I call you Ann?

229
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:53,623
You wouldn't happen to be a size four, by any chance?

230
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,186
No, no. Oh, God, no.

231
00:14:58,264 --> 00:15:00,789
You've got me all wrong. Miss Darrow, please.

232
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,959
I'm not that type of person at all.

233
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:04,730
What type of person are you?

234
00:15:04,803 --> 00:15:07,772
I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a movie producer.

235
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,901
Believe me, I am on the level. No funny business. Please sit down.

236
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:14,543
Please. Please.

237
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,542
Okay.

238
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,078
Ann, I want you to imagine...

239
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,817
a handsome explorer bound for the Far East.

240
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:28,189
You're filming in the Far East?

241
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,758
Singapore.

242
00:15:31,797 --> 00:15:34,595
On board ship, he meets a mysterious girl.

243
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,495
She's beautiful, she's fragile, haunted.

244
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,267
And she can't escape the feeling that forces beyond her control...

245
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,243
are compelling her down a road from which she cannot draw back.

246
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:50,504
It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment...

247
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:56,253
this fateful meeting that changes everything.

248
00:15:57,323 --> 00:16:00,884
And sure enough, against her better judgment...

249
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,650
She falls in love.

250
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:04,420
Yes.

251
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,554
But she doesn't trust it.

252
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,700
She's not even sure if she believes in love.

253
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,160
Uh...

254
00:16:12,237 --> 00:16:13,431
really?

255
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,971
If she loves someone, it's doomed.

256
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,440
Why is that?

257
00:16:17,943 --> 00:16:20,434
Good things never last, Mr. Denam.

258
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,517
So you're interested. Good. That's settled, then.

259
00:16:28,587 --> 00:16:31,112
Now, I don't wanna rush you, but we are under some time pressure.

260
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,624
Well, I really... Ann, I'm telling you...

261
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,023
you're perfect. Look at you.

262
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:37,085
You're the saddest girl I've ever met.

263
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:41,258
You're gonna make them weep, Ann. You're gonna break their hearts.

264
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:44,626
See, that's where you're wrong, Mr. Denam.

265
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:47,297
I make people laugh, that's what I do.

266
00:16:47,806 --> 00:16:49,933
Good luck with your picture.

267
00:16:53,145 --> 00:16:55,340
Ann? Miss Darrow, please!

268
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:56,813
I'm offering you money.

269
00:16:56,882 --> 00:17:00,545
Adventure, fame, the thrill of a lifetime, and a long sea voyage.

270
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:01,711
You want to read a script?

271
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:04,847
Jack Driscoll's turning in a draft as we speak.

272
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,226
Jack Driscoll?

273
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:09,624
Sure. Why?

274
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,686
Wait. You know him?

275
00:17:12,798 --> 00:17:16,325
No, not personally. I've seen his plays.

276
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:18,403
What a writer, huh? And let me tell you, Ann...

277
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,496
Jack Driscoll does not want just anyone starring in this picture.

278
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,938
He said to me, "Carl...

279
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:26,375
"somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role."

280
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,845
And as soon as I saw you, I knew.

281
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,481
Knew what?

282
00:17:34,486 --> 00:17:36,750
It was always going to be you.

283
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:51,267
How much do I owe you? Make it a quarter.

284
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,928
Keep the change.

285
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,772
Is this the moving picture ship?

286
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,776
Not exactly.

287
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,278
It's actually this one over here.

288
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:15,954
Don't let appearances deceive you. It's much more spacious on board.

289
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:18,890
Is this all of the equipment? Yeah.

290
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:20,056
This is all of it? Yeah.

291
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,724
We're taking the Bell & howell? Yeah.

292
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,496
Good. You got all the lenses? Sure.

293
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:26,128
Carl! Yes!

294
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,571
Get it on board, fellows, come on.

295
00:18:32,344 --> 00:18:33,368
It's bad, it's bad.

296
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,345
They're on their way. I've just had word.

297
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,541
Who? Men in uniform.

298
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:39,709
The studio called the cops.

299
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,212
Englehorn! Cast off!

300
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,189
Hoist up the mainsail, raise the anchor...

301
00:18:46,258 --> 00:18:48,317
whatever the hell it is you do. We gotta leave!

302
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,054
I cannot do that.

303
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,396
We are waiting on the manifest.

304
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,932
What? Who? English, please.

305
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,065
Paperwork, Mr. Denam.

306
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,765
I'll give you another $1,000 to leave now.

307
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,273
You haven't given me the first $1,000 yet.

308
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,506
Can we talk about this later?

309
00:19:05,577 --> 00:19:08,410
Can't you see we're in the company of a VIP guest?

310
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,516
Ma'am.

311
00:19:16,421 --> 00:19:17,786
Ann Darrow.

312
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:21,949
So you are ready for this voyage, Miss Darrow?

313
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:23,319
Sure.

314
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,458
Nervous?

315
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:31,001
Nervous? No.

316
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,303
Why? Should I be?

317
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:37,470
It isn't every woman who would take such a risk.

318
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,546
Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin?

319
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:46,415
Wonderful idea. Thank you, Preston.

320
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:48,919
Miss Darrow, if you would just...

321
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:54,314
hi. My name is Preston. Carl's assistant.

322
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,427
$2,000. It's a deal. Will you take a check?

323
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,759
Do I have a choice?

324
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,332
Please follow me.

325
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,665
If there's anything that you... Excuse me, fellows.

326
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:08,638
If there's anything that you need, please don't hesitate to ask.

327
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,491
Oh, Jesus! Jack, you scared me.

328
00:20:29,561 --> 00:20:33,964
Listen. If anyone comes to the door,
don't open it. You haven't seen me.

329
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,624
Say I got depressed and committed suicide.

330
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,897
Say I stuck my head down the toilet.

331
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:41,897
You want one? No. I can't stay, Carl.

332
00:20:41,974 --> 00:20:45,000
I got a rehearsal for which I am now three hours late.

333
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,243
What's this? It's the script.

334
00:20:51,383 --> 00:20:53,010
This is a script?

335
00:20:53,619 --> 00:20:55,883
Jack, this is 15 pages.

336
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:58,582
I know, but they're good. You've got 15 good pages there, Carl.

337
00:20:58,657 --> 00:21:00,648
I'm supposed to be making a feature-length picture.

338
00:21:00,726 --> 00:21:03,126
You told me I had more time. I'm sorry. Look, I gotta go.

339
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:05,220
No, Jack, you can't do this to me. I have a beginning...

340
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,891
but I need a middle and an end. I gotta have something to shoot.

341
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:11,163
Look, you got my notes. I got to go, pal. See you.

342
00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:18,132
All right, fine. We might as well settle up.

343
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,010
You're gonna pay me?

344
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,013
I'm not gonna stiff a friend.

345
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,015
I've never known you to volunteer cash before.

346
00:21:28,086 --> 00:21:29,917
How's $2,000 sound?

347
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,023
Sounds great.

348
00:21:33,091 --> 00:21:34,820
I thought it might.

349
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:37,418
Sounds great. Okay.

350
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,294
Raise the spring line!

351
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:41,957
Watch the aft!

352
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,101
And voila.

353
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:53,972
Thanks.

354
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:58,841
You've written "two grand."

355
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:04,682
So I did. Sorry about that. Let's start from the beginning.

356
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:07,457
"Two thousand dollars."

357
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,028
It is the 29th, isn't it?

358
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:19,900
Oh, come on, it's the 25th. It's the 25th.

359
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,502
God, I'm sorry. It'll just take a sec.

360
00:22:22,574 --> 00:22:24,735
Never mind, Carl. Just pay me when you get back.

361
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,175
All right.

362
00:22:39,591 --> 00:22:42,651
Your cabin is the last on the left, Mr. Baxter.

363
00:22:42,728 --> 00:22:47,222
And may I just say how excited we are to have you back with us, sir?

364
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:49,095
Be a sport and lend a hand here, would you?

365
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:51,635
Excuse me. I'm trying to... I gotta get...

366
00:22:54,239 --> 00:22:55,433
Christ!

367
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:58,141
Appreciate the help, fellow.

368
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,337
Let me get the door for you.

369
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,604
Welcome to your stateroom, sir.

370
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,213
Dead slow ahead both, Mr. Hayes.

371
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:13,223
Dead slow ahead both, Captain.

372
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,566
Oh, Christ!

373
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:33,376
God damn it!

374
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:45,223
I keep telling you, Jack, there's no money in theater.

375
00:23:48,226 --> 00:23:49,750
Oh, no! No!

376
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,994
You're much better off sticking with film.

377
00:23:54,232 --> 00:23:56,666
I don't do it for the money, Carl.

378
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,264
I happen to love the theater.

379
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:02,195
No, you don't.

380
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,466
If you really loved it...

381
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,503
you would have jumped.

382
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,183
You! This is your fault!

383
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:30,762
This room very comfortable. Plenty dim light, fresh straw.

384
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:32,861
Jesus. What do you keep down here?

385
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:35,270
Lion, tiger, hippo, you name it.

386
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,037
You sell them to zoos?

387
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:39,701
Zoo, circus.

388
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:42,606
Skipper get big money for rare animal.

389
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
Careful. Camel have bad accident on floor.

390
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:47,712
Stain unremovable.

391
00:24:50,889 --> 00:24:53,323
Skipper catch any wild animal you want.

392
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:55,291
He'll do you real good price on white rhino.

393
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,452
Choy.

394
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:02,130
My apologies for not being able to offer you a cabin.

395
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,998
Have you found an enclosure to your taste?

396
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,535
Spoiled for choice.

397
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,336
What are you, Mr. Driscoll? A lion?

398
00:25:11,409 --> 00:25:13,138
Or a chimpanzee?

399
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,240
I'll take this one.

400
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,855
I told you to lock it up.

401
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:34,456
Sorry, Skipper. Lumpy said... Lumpy doesn't give the orders!

402
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,593
What are you trying to do? Put the whole ship to sleep?

403
00:25:40,906 --> 00:25:42,703
Get them out of here.

404
00:26:17,776 --> 00:26:20,711
Compliments of the chef. Okay.

405
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,109
Oh, Christ. Oh, God.

406
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:31,019
Lamb's brains in walnut sauce.

407
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,855
Jimmy.

408
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:40,031
You run those ropes up on deck like I told you?

409
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:42,089
Doing it now, Mr. Hayes.

410
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,302
How about you return Mr. Driscoll's pen first?

411
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,977
He don't mean no harm.

412
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:57,971
Thanks.

413
00:26:58,049 --> 00:26:59,812
I'll keep him out of your way. It's okay.

414
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,409
It's just that he likes it down here.

415
00:27:02,487 --> 00:27:05,081
It's where I found him four years ago.

416
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:08,017
Stowed away in one of them back cages.

417
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:11,728
His arm was broken in two places.

418
00:27:12,931 --> 00:27:15,798
He was wilder than half the animals in here.

419
00:27:16,701 --> 00:27:19,295
Still won't tell me where he came from.

420
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,599
But it wasn't anyplace good.

421
00:27:25,276 --> 00:27:27,267
You got to straighten up.

422
00:27:27,545 --> 00:27:28,705
Jimmy.

423
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,506
You don't want to be on this ship the rest of your life.

424
00:27:32,584 --> 00:27:34,950
Yes, I do. No, you don't, Jimmy.

425
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,519
You got to be smart. Get yourself educated.

426
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:39,523
Give yourself some options. Take this seriously!

427
00:27:39,591 --> 00:27:41,718
I do, Mr. Hayes, I do. Look.

428
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,350
I've been reading.

429
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,992
Where'd you get this?

430
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,322
I borrowed it.

431
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:54,771
On long-term loan.

432
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:56,706
Look at this. Look, look.

433
00:27:56,775 --> 00:28:00,040
"Adventures on a tramp steamer." See? Just like us.

434
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,746
It's so nice to meet you, Mr. Driscoll.

435
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:13,322
I'm actually quite familiar with your work, yes.

436
00:28:17,295 --> 00:28:20,458
Hello, Mr. Driscoll. It's so nice to meet you.

437
00:28:20,598 --> 00:28:23,499
Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work.

438
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:25,796
I'm a huge fan.

439
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,804
I've read everything you've ever written.

440
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,339
No, too much.

441
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,306
Gonna have the ship's engines all over the dialogue.

442
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,376
Seagulls.

443
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,541
Camera noise. Wind. Christ knows what else.

444
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,776
I don't care, Mike.

445
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,251
You're the sound recordist. Make it work.

446
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,520
Ann! Come on in. Let me introduce you to the crew.

447
00:28:46,591 --> 00:28:48,786
This is herb, the cameraman.

448
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,056
Delighted to meet you, ma'am. Likewise.

449
00:28:52,130 --> 00:28:54,291
May I say what a lovely dress?

450
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:57,266
Oh, this old thing? I just threw it on.

451
00:28:57,769 --> 00:29:00,294
Isn't that one of Maureers costumes?

452
00:29:00,672 --> 00:29:04,403
Now, what does a girl have to do around here to get some breakfast?

453
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,501
Lumpy, you heard the lady.

454
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:10,036
Fancy my porridge a la walnuts?

455
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:16,780
Oh, Ann, I don't believe you've met...

456
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:20,248
Ann?

457
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:23,888
That's all right, Mr. Denam. I know who this is.

458
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:32,796
Thrilled to meet you. It's an honor to be a part of this.

459
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:35,437
Gee, thanks.

460
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,941
Actually, I'm quite familiar with your work.

461
00:29:39,377 --> 00:29:40,571
Really?

462
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:43,438
Yes, and what I most admire...

463
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,144
is the way you've captured the voice of the common people.

464
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,183
Well, that's my job.

465
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,423
I'm sure you've heard this before, Mr. Driscoll...

466
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,960
if you don't mind me saying...

467
00:29:57,028 --> 00:30:00,088
but you don't look at all like your photograph.

468
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,931
Excuse me. Wait a minute, Ann...

469
00:30:07,005 --> 00:30:09,803
he's so much younger in person. And much better-looking.

470
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,501
Ann, stop. Stop right there.

471
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,737
You see, I was just afraid that you might be...

472
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:16,610
one of those self-obsessed literary types.

473
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:18,514
I'm sorry, I'm not... You know...

474
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:22,314
the tweedy twerp with his nose in his book and his head up his a...

475
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:29,220
It's nice to meet you, too, Miss Darrow.

476
00:30:43,107 --> 00:30:44,506
Good Christ!

477
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:12,970
She's standing at the railing.

478
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,561
She doesn't know it yet...

479
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:19,299
But they are sailing towards disaster. You got that?

480
00:31:19,477 --> 00:31:21,206
Okay, so she turns...

481
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,413
the first mate is staggering towards her.

482
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:28,344
There's a knife sticking out of his back.

483
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:31,354
Wait a sec. We're killing off the first mate?

484
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,085
That's assuming she knows who the first mate is.

485
00:31:34,158 --> 00:31:36,991
Come on, Jack. It was an honest mistake.

486
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,621
Ann is nearsighted. It could have happened to anyone.

487
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:41,289
I was joking, Carl.

488
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:44,665
The point is, she's horrified. She has to look away.

489
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:49,499
And that's when she sees it.

490
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:53,041
Sees what?

491
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,404
What?

492
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:02,317
The island.

493
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:10,427
We're filming on an island now? When did this happen?

494
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,596
Jack, keep your voice down.

495
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,659
I don't want the crew getting spooked.

496
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:20,261
Why would they get spooked? What's it called?

497
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,363
All right. It has a local name...

498
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,965
but I'm warning you, Jack, it doesn't sound good.

499
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:27,739
They call it Skull Island.

500
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,540
Did you get that?

501
00:32:30,348 --> 00:32:31,679
What's wrong with this place?

502
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:34,479
There's nothing officially wrong with it.

503
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:38,053
Because, technically, it hasn't been discovered yet.

504
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,426
Okay. All right.

505
00:32:44,662 --> 00:32:46,892
So we arrive at this place.

506
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:48,692
S... S...

507
00:32:49,334 --> 00:32:50,528
K... K...

508
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:52,934
U... U...

509
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:55,132
L... L...

510
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:57,903
L... L...

511
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,746
Island.

512
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,114
All right, everyone, from the top! And action!

513
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:17,354
I think this is awfully exciting! I've never been on a ship before.

514
00:33:17,428 --> 00:33:20,022
And I've never been on one with a woman before.

515
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:23,556
I guess you don't think much of women on ships, do you?

516
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,596
No, they're a nuisance.

517
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,333
Well, I'll try not to be. Just being around is trouble.

518
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:38,673
Cut!

519
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,149
It's great.

520
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:45,517
Bruce, wonderful performance. You can relax for 10 minutes.

521
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,491
That was very natural. I felt moved.

522
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:52,118
What do you think, Driscoll? Dialogue's got some flow now, huh?

523
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,027
It was pure effluence.

524
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,861
I beefed up the banter.

525
00:33:55,933 --> 00:33:58,060
Try to resist that impulse.

526
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:00,364
It's just a little bit of humor, bud.

527
00:34:00,438 --> 00:34:02,906
What are you, a Bolshevik or something?

528
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,168
Actors.

529
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:08,608
Travel the world, but all they ever see is a mirror.

530
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,423
Good legs.

531
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:26,689
Sea legs. Well, you know, sea legs.

532
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:30,291
Yeah.

533
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:33,997
Not that you don't have good legs. Just making conversation.

534
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:36,370
Jesus. Miss Darrow!

535
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,867
About the scene today with you and Bruce...

536
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,776
I know it wasn't what you wrote...

537
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:46,874
but Mr. Baxter felt very strongly that when a man likes a woman...

538
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:49,179
he must ignore her.

539
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,120
And if things turn really hostile, then...

540
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:54,184
No?

541
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:55,987
Interesting theory.

542
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:58,719
I know. I should have...

543
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:01,093
It wasn't what I had intended, but...

544
00:35:01,165 --> 00:35:02,689
I'm sorry. I was...

545
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,758
And you made it your own.

546
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,226
I was nervous.

547
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,066
It was funny, actually. You were funny.

548
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,306
Please don't say another word. Good night.

549
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,776
Miss Darrow.

550
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,613
You don't have to be nervous.

551
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,488
Thank you.

552
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,020
Let's take it...

553
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,426
Would you please... We're trying to shoot a scene.

554
00:36:39,497 --> 00:36:41,124
Okay. Thank you.

555
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,658
Okay, again.

556
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,410
We're close. Turn southwest.

557
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:03,047
There's no land southwest for thousands of miles.

558
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:07,514
It takes us way outside the shipping lanes.

559
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,083
I won't sail blind in these waters.

560
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,358
I'll make it worth your while.

561
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:16,690
There's nothing out there.

562
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,835
Well, then you've nothing to lose.

563
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:35,841
If someone were to tell you this ship was headed for Singapore...

564
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,050
what would you say?

565
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,920
I would say they're full of it, Mr. Hayes.

566
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:46,419
Well, we turned southwest last night.

567
00:37:46,631 --> 00:37:48,292
Gentlemen, please.

568
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,225
We're not looking for trouble. No.

569
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:55,971
You're looking for something else.

570
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:00,742
Yes, we are.

571
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:04,779
We're going to find Skull Island.

572
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:08,216
Find it, film it, and show it to the world.

573
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,986
For 25 cents, you get to see the last blank space on the map.

574
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,586
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

575
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,522
What do you mean?

576
00:38:20,264 --> 00:38:22,858
Seven years ago, me and Mr. Hayes were working our passage...

577
00:38:22,933 --> 00:38:24,491
on a Norwegian bark.

578
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,401
We picked up a castaway. We found him in the water.

579
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,503
He'd been drifting for days.

580
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,974
His ship had run aground on an island way west of Sumatra.

581
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:36,502
An island hidden in fog.

582
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,546
He spoke of a huge wall...

583
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:43,582
built so long ago...

584
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,113
no one knew who'd made it.

585
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:49,258
A wall 100 foot high...

586
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,360
as strong today as it was ages ago.

587
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,122
Why'd they build the wall?

588
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:04,234
Well, the castaway, he spoke of a creature...

589
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:06,768
neither beast nor man...

590
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,543
but something monstrous, living behind that wall.

591
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:12,942
A lion or a tiger.

592
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:16,216
A man-eater. That's how all these stories start.

593
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,084
What else did he say?

594
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:19,548
Nothing.

595
00:39:19,623 --> 00:39:22,387
We found him the next morning.
He'd stuck a knife through his heart.

596
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,722
Mmm-hmm.

597
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,954
Sorry, fellows. You'll have to do better than that.

598
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,463
Monsters belong in B movies.

599
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,559
If you find this place...

600
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:36,506
if you go ashore with your friends and your cameras...

601
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:39,370
you won't come back.

602
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,869
Just as long as you understand that.

603
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,593
How long do you expect us to stay out here?

604
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,432
You're writing a stage comedy?

605
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:15,471
I'm writing it for you.

606
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,506
Why would you do that?

607
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,311
Why would I write a play for you? Yes.

608
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:26,576
Isn't it obvious?

609
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,651
Not to me.

610
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:35,686
Well...

611
00:41:37,228 --> 00:41:39,025
it's in the subtext.

612
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,995
I guess I must have missed it.

613
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,903
It's not about words.

614
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,042
Message for you, Captain.

615
00:42:54,438 --> 00:42:56,065
What's going on?

616
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,673
Hayes, why are we changing course?

617
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,509
Englehorn, you can't just... Outside.

618
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,179
There's a warrant out for your arrest.

619
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,148
Did you know that?

620
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:17,220
I've been ordered to divert to Rangoon.

621
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:24,697
Another week. I haven't got a film yet.

622
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,767
Please. I have risked everything I have on this.

623
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:32,104
No, Denam. You risked everything I have.

624
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,273
What do you want?

625
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,610
Tell me what you want. I'll give you anything.

626
00:43:37,681 --> 00:43:39,615
I want you off my ship.

627
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,677
Set a course for Rangoon, Mr. Hayes.

628
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,762
I'm finished.

629
00:43:54,231 --> 00:43:56,096
It's over for me, Jack.

630
00:43:57,835 --> 00:44:00,326
How'd you think this would end, Carl?

631
00:44:16,053 --> 00:44:19,489
Check our position. Use the stars.

632
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:35,264
There are no stars, Captain.

633
00:44:37,708 --> 00:44:39,107
What is that?

634
00:44:41,078 --> 00:44:43,171
What? That.

635
00:44:47,151 --> 00:44:48,812
That right there.

636
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,617
I don't know. What is it? A coffee stain?

637
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,788
Station the forward lookout and get me the depth by lead line.

638
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,559
Aye, Captain.

639
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,998
30 fathoms, no bottom!

640
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:54,811
Reduce speed, steerage way only.

641
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:57,444
Dead slow ahead, both.

642
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,475
You should stop the ship.

643
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:05,651
15 degrees port.

644
00:47:08,525 --> 00:47:10,254
We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes.

645
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,454
We'll find clear conditions.

646
00:47:13,130 --> 00:47:14,654
We have seabed!

647
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:21,894
25 fathoms!

648
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:25,241
We're shallowing!

649
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:26,674
20 degrees starboard!

650
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,802
Captain, you don't know where the hell you're going!

651
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:30,506
Get me another reading!

652
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:35,342
Another reading!

653
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,617
22 fathoms!

654
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:43,217
Douse the lights. Aye, Captain.

655
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,638
10 fathoms!

656
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:11,016
Wall! There's a wall ahead!

657
00:48:28,272 --> 00:48:29,762
Stop engines!

658
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:34,867
Give me some power! Half astern both.

659
00:49:34,938 --> 00:49:37,031
Half astern both, Captain!

660
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:42,805
Rocks!

661
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,076
Rocks!

662
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:53,816
Rocks to starboard, Captain!

663
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,690
To port! Rocks everywhere!

664
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,452
Take the wheel, Hayes.

665
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:16,840
Hang on!

666
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:41,668
Full ahead!

667
00:50:47,477 --> 00:50:49,377
Rocks to port, Captain!

668
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:53,111
Turn, Captain! Starboard, starboard!

669
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:13,831
Ah!

670
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,129
Shore up that breach!

671
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,470
Get me more men down here now! Come on, move, move!

672
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:29,809
Hayes! She's taken a pounding!

673
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:33,515
What about the prop?

674
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,778
The shaft's not bent, as far as we can tell.

675
00:52:35,852 --> 00:52:38,082
But she struck hard against the rock!

676
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:40,317
Captain!

677
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,754
Better come up quick!

678
00:52:44,628 --> 00:52:46,027
Right there!

679
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,937
Want me to bring them back?

680
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,275
I don't give a damn about Carl Denam.

681
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,840
I want this ship fixed and ready to float on the next high tide!

682
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,546
Come on, move it.

683
00:53:11,721 --> 00:53:13,712
We're leaving, Mr. Hayes.

684
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,224
Can you believe this, Jack?

685
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,401
We've got our picture.

686
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:28,725
Why does Marlow keep going up the river?

687
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,091
Why doesn't he turn back?

688
00:54:34,537 --> 00:54:37,370
There's a part of him that wants to, Jimmy.

689
00:54:38,708 --> 00:54:41,871
A part deep inside himself that sounds a warning.

690
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,773
But there's another part...

691
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,645
that needs to know.

692
00:54:51,888 --> 00:54:54,721
To defeat the thing which makes him afraid.

693
00:54:56,593 --> 00:54:59,892
"We could not understand because we were too far...

694
00:55:00,764 --> 00:55:01,958
"and could not remember...

695
00:55:02,032 --> 00:55:05,559
"because we were traveling in the night of first ages...

696
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,701
"of those ages that are gone...

697
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,602
"leaving hardly a sign, and no memories.

698
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:16,706
"We are accustomed to look...

699
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,943
"upon the shackled form of a conquered monster...

700
00:55:22,419 --> 00:55:23,909
"but there...

701
00:55:25,288 --> 00:55:29,054
"there you could look at a thing monstrous and free."

702
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:41,299
It's not an adventure story...

703
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,498
is it, Mr. Hayes?

704
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,839
No, Jimmy.

705
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:49,343
It's not.

706
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,235
It's deserted. Of course it's deserted.

707
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,740
Use your eyes, Preston. The place is a ruin.

708
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:21,973
Nobody's lived here for hundreds of years.

709
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:38,343
Mr. Denam, I think we should go back.

710
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,150
I will handle this.

711
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:47,222
Look. Chocolate.

712
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,194
You like chocolate?

713
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,630
It's good to eat.

714
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,235
You want?

715
00:58:04,247 --> 00:58:05,475
Take it.

716
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,589
Here, put it in your hand and take it.

717
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,098
For God's sakes, Denam, leave the native alone.

718
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,465
She doesn't want the chocolate.

719
00:58:28,438 --> 00:58:29,666
Aah!

720
00:58:51,694 --> 00:58:53,059
All right!

721
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,920
Just a bunch of women and old folks!

722
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:59,361
They're harmless!

723
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,175
Ann!

724
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:50,764
Jack.

725
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:06,386
Seen enough?

726
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,891
Lighten the ship!

727
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:20,062
Anything that's not bolted down goes overboard!

728
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,895
Just heave it!

729
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:25,668
We got away.

730
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,471
We gotta be grateful for that, gentlemen.

731
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,309
What about Mike? He didn't get away! He's still there!

732
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:35,313
Mike died doing what he believed in! He didn't die for nothing.

733
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,445
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm gonna finish this film for Mike!

734
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:47,522
I'll finish it...

735
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:51,730
and I'll donate the proceeds...

736
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:54,232
to his wife and kids.

737
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:58,231
Because that man is a hero, and he deserves nothing less.

738
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:00,440
Hear, hear!

739
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,348
Chuck everything except for the potatoes!

740
01:03:46,889 --> 01:03:49,722
What's wrong now? Excuse me, Shakespeare.

741
01:03:50,226 --> 01:03:52,592
Come on, men! Come on, hurry!

742
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:07,241
Drop those spare cables overboard! Go on, just chuck it!

743
01:04:25,661 --> 01:04:26,821
Where's Ann? What?

744
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:28,056
Where's Ann?

745
01:04:33,436 --> 01:04:34,425
Ann!

746
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:55,554
She's free!

747
01:05:01,898 --> 01:05:04,492
Full ahead, both engines!

748
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,207
Ann!

749
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:38,699
No! Stop! Turn back!

750
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:41,264
Stop!

751
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:44,969
We have to turn back.

752
01:05:45,174 --> 01:05:46,835
They've taken Ann.

753
01:05:53,316 --> 01:05:54,340
No!

754
01:05:59,255 --> 01:06:02,349
Kong! Kong! Kong!

755
01:06:44,533 --> 01:06:48,435
All hands going ashore! Report to stations!

756
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:52,173
Jump to it! Jump to it, gentlemen!

757
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,574
We're doing it, Mr. Hayes!

758
01:07:04,887 --> 01:07:06,650
Come on, move it!

759
01:07:23,672 --> 01:07:25,333
Pull harder!

760
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:28,575
Row! Row!

761
01:07:28,778 --> 01:07:29,972
Come on!

762
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:17,918
Kong.

763
01:10:40,302 --> 01:10:42,099
Spread out! Find her!

764
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,278
Miss Darrow!

765
01:10:52,481 --> 01:10:55,279
Check up there, Jimmy! Everybody stay together!

766
01:10:58,721 --> 01:10:59,745
Ann!

767
01:11:01,890 --> 01:11:03,653
She's here somewhere!

768
01:11:08,364 --> 01:11:10,195
What in God's name was that?

769
01:11:16,572 --> 01:11:18,164
Behind the wall!

770
01:11:18,907 --> 01:11:20,499
Behind the wall!

771
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,526
She's gone!

772
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,269
Carl, what is it?

773
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:34,576
You saw something.

774
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:44,555
You can take Hayes and 15 others.

775
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:48,024
I'll put a guard on the gate until you return.

776
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:50,588
The rest of you stay with the ship.

777
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:51,791
Choy!

778
01:12:53,569 --> 01:12:55,127
Not you, Jimmy.

779
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,364
Come on, Mr. Hayes. Look at them.

780
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:59,202
None of them knows which way to point a gun.

781
01:12:59,274 --> 01:13:00,605
Stay here.

782
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,578
Miss Darrow needs me! No!

783
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,816
Bring the tripod and all of the film stock.

784
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:13,320
You wanna go with the 6-inch lens?

785
01:13:13,789 --> 01:13:16,189
The wide-angle will do just fine.

786
01:13:22,197 --> 01:13:25,132
You got guns. You got food. You got the ammo.

787
01:13:25,601 --> 01:13:27,398
And you got 24 hours!

788
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:29,303
24 hours?

789
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,699
This time tomorrow, we haul anchor.

790
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,688
Miss Darrow!

791
01:13:59,067 --> 01:14:00,193
Ann!

792
01:14:03,605 --> 01:14:05,004
Miss Darrow!

793
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:14,644
Miss Darrow!

794
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,361
What is it?

795
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:45,172
Fire!

796
01:14:47,115 --> 01:14:48,514
Cut it out.

797
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,243
Hold your fire.

798
01:14:51,453 --> 01:14:53,011
Hold your fire!

799
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:26,019
Stay down, damn it. Stay down.

800
01:15:41,169 --> 01:15:44,900
Come on. Come on. Come on.

801
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:18,496
Good shooting, Mr. Hayes.

802
01:16:22,611 --> 01:16:25,045
Aren't these things supposed to be extinct?

803
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,614
They are now.

804
01:16:32,321 --> 01:16:34,949
What the hell kind of a place is this?

805
01:16:50,505 --> 01:16:51,904
Miss Darrow!

806
01:16:56,612 --> 01:16:57,670
Ann!

807
01:18:13,221 --> 01:18:14,210
No!

808
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,135
Ann! Miss Darrow!

809
01:18:42,751 --> 01:18:43,809
Ann!

810
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,253
Ann!

811
01:19:31,266 --> 01:19:33,666
Christ, it's a bleeding boneyard!

812
01:19:35,070 --> 01:19:37,538
They've been ripped limb from limb.

813
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,808
Ann! Ann!

814
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:57,320
Just keep walking, Mr. Hayes. Pretend you didn't see me.

815
01:19:57,392 --> 01:19:59,383
Jesus, Jimmy. Hey, I need that!

816
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,689
I'm not giving you a gun!

817
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:02,787
You were younger than me when they gave you one!

818
01:20:02,864 --> 01:20:06,425
I was in the Army. I was trained. I had a drill sergeant.

819
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,030
I wanna help bring her back.

820
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,847
Don't make me regret it.

821
01:20:47,172 --> 01:20:49,163
Conserve your ammunition!

822
01:20:58,517 --> 01:21:00,007
I'm knackered.

823
01:21:02,321 --> 01:21:04,380
I gotta have a breather. Great idea.

824
01:21:04,456 --> 01:21:05,923
Fellows, we don't have time for this.

825
01:21:05,991 --> 01:21:08,459
We've lost too much ground already. Come on, get up!

826
01:21:08,527 --> 01:21:11,963
They're not about to quit on you. Cut them some slack.

827
01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:14,429
All right, you got five minutes!

828
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:16,600
Everybody stay in sight.

829
01:21:20,606 --> 01:21:24,042
Over here. I'm gonna get a wide shot of the valley.

830
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:55,638
Bloody Nora!

831
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:05,011
Is that what took Miss Darrow?

832
01:22:08,587 --> 01:22:12,717
There's only one creature capable of leaving a footprint that size.

833
01:22:19,164 --> 01:22:21,064
The abominable snowman.

834
01:22:22,668 --> 01:22:25,364
Yeah, a snowman. We dead meat.

835
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:28,471
It's got to be what, 20, 25 feet?

836
01:22:30,576 --> 01:22:32,009
Carl saw it.

837
01:22:33,412 --> 01:22:34,902
Let's ask him.

838
01:22:37,015 --> 01:22:38,209
Denam!

839
01:22:40,786 --> 01:22:42,048
Where'd he go?

840
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,037
Walk forward, Bruce.

841
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,373
What? You're the star of this picture.

842
01:23:06,445 --> 01:23:09,505
Get into character and head toward the animals.

843
01:23:15,654 --> 01:23:18,248
What the hell kind of a place is this?

844
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:30,799
Are you sure about this, Denam?

845
01:23:31,303 --> 01:23:33,362
Don't we have a stand-in for this type of thing?

846
01:23:33,438 --> 01:23:36,373
I need you in the shot, or people will say they're fake.

847
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:38,636
Nobody's gonna think these are fake.

848
01:23:47,319 --> 01:23:49,310
You're making them nervous. No sudden movements.

849
01:23:49,388 --> 01:23:50,685
I'm not moving.

850
01:23:56,461 --> 01:23:58,793
Mother of God.

851
01:24:20,752 --> 01:24:22,117
What's this?

852
01:24:48,346 --> 01:24:49,813
What is it? What is it? Where's Carl?

853
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:52,679
Carl? He's up there, filming.

854
01:25:03,128 --> 01:25:04,527
Bugger this!

855
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:06,627
Watch out.

856
01:25:11,937 --> 01:25:13,734
Run, Jack!

857
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,066
Holy Christ. Go, Jimmy, run!

858
01:25:19,978 --> 01:25:21,468
Run, run, run!

859
01:25:28,353 --> 01:25:29,945
Let go! I'm not leaving the camera!

860
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:31,318
Let go, you idiot!

861
01:25:31,389 --> 01:25:33,220
Carl, run!

862
01:25:46,671 --> 01:25:47,933
Look out!

863
01:25:48,774 --> 01:25:49,798
Look out!

864
01:26:40,125 --> 01:26:41,649
Coming through!

865
01:27:45,957 --> 01:27:46,981
No!

866
01:27:47,659 --> 01:27:48,921
Come on.

867
01:28:30,068 --> 01:28:32,798
Carl! Carl!

868
01:28:35,974 --> 01:28:38,499
Get up! Come on. Come on.

869
01:28:53,325 --> 01:28:55,987
Mr. Denam! Mr. Denam!

870
01:28:56,695 --> 01:28:59,289
Herb! Herb, come on!

871
01:28:59,364 --> 01:29:01,093
Take the tripod!

872
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:02,561
Come on!

873
01:29:03,768 --> 01:29:06,328
I'm pulling you up! Hold on to your end!

874
01:29:06,404 --> 01:29:07,428
Go!

875
01:29:07,505 --> 01:29:09,200
No, I'm not going anywhere without you!

876
01:29:09,874 --> 01:29:12,536
You gotta leave me! Shut up and hold on!

877
01:30:20,278 --> 01:30:22,007
Jimmy, do a head count.

878
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,605
I want to know how many are injured and how bad.

879
01:30:24,682 --> 01:30:25,944
Injured?

880
01:30:27,352 --> 01:30:29,115
Four of us are dead!

881
01:30:35,827 --> 01:30:37,590
It's not your fault.

882
01:30:38,029 --> 01:30:40,725
What happened to herb is no one's fault.

883
01:30:41,199 --> 01:30:43,599
You're absolutely right, Preston.

884
01:30:44,002 --> 01:30:46,402
And I'll tell you something else.

885
01:30:46,471 --> 01:30:48,769
Herbert didn't die for nothing.

886
01:30:49,174 --> 01:30:51,972
He died for what he believed in, and I'm gonna honor that.

887
01:30:52,043 --> 01:30:56,104
He died believing there was still some mystery left in this world.

888
01:30:56,581 --> 01:30:59,175
And we could all have a piece of it...

889
01:30:59,384 --> 01:31:01,909
for the price of an admission ticket.

890
01:31:02,153 --> 01:31:05,850
God damn it, Preston, we're gonna finish this film for Herb.

891
01:31:06,257 --> 01:31:07,918
We'll finish it...

892
01:31:08,026 --> 01:31:10,927
and donate the proceeds to his wife and kids.

893
01:31:18,203 --> 01:31:20,433
Come on, guys. We need more rope.

894
01:31:22,373 --> 01:31:24,364
All right, we gotta get back to the ship.

895
01:31:24,442 --> 01:31:28,139
Englehorn sails in nine hours. So? We gotta find Miss Darrow.

896
01:31:28,213 --> 01:31:30,841
Hey, do you hear me? We're gonna be stranded here.

897
01:31:32,684 --> 01:31:36,085
Miss Darrow was a great gal, no question.

898
01:31:36,554 --> 01:31:38,283
And she was a wonderful person.

899
01:31:38,356 --> 01:31:41,587
It's a terrible loss and we're all gonna miss her.

900
01:31:41,893 --> 01:31:45,795
I always knew you were nothing like the tough guy you play on screen.

901
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:47,593
I just never figured you for a coward.

902
01:31:47,665 --> 01:31:49,792
Hey, pal! Hey, wake up.

903
01:31:50,335 --> 01:31:52,803
Heroes don't look like me, not in the real world.

904
01:31:52,871 --> 01:31:56,432
In the real world, they got bad teeth, a bald spot, and a beer gut.

905
01:31:56,508 --> 01:32:00,035
I'm just an actor with a gun, who's lost his motivation.

906
01:32:01,479 --> 01:32:02,969
Be seeing you.

907
01:32:04,215 --> 01:32:05,580
Anyone else?

908
01:32:07,118 --> 01:32:09,086
Well, see you. Come on.

909
01:37:05,783 --> 01:37:06,977
No!

910
01:37:07,685 --> 01:37:09,118
I said no!

911
01:37:16,594 --> 01:37:20,155
That's all there is. There isn't any more.

912
01:39:42,573 --> 01:39:45,371
Get them off the boat. Get them off the boat.

913
01:39:47,678 --> 01:39:49,202
Keep paddling.

914
01:40:26,117 --> 01:40:28,017
What the hell was that?

915
01:41:09,226 --> 01:41:11,592
Come on. Get them out of there!

916
01:41:13,397 --> 01:41:14,728
Preston!

917
01:41:19,904 --> 01:41:21,531
Give me your hand.

918
01:41:22,039 --> 01:41:23,165
Jack!

919
01:41:28,612 --> 01:41:29,943
Jack!

920
01:41:34,685 --> 01:41:36,016
Choy! Help!

921
01:41:36,187 --> 01:41:38,178
Swim, you filthy bugger.

922
01:42:47,291 --> 01:42:48,781
Choy!

923
01:42:50,694 --> 01:42:51,718
Stay with him.

924
01:42:51,796 --> 01:42:53,229
Swim to shore as fast as you can!

925
01:42:53,297 --> 01:42:54,525
Hold on. Preston!

926
01:42:55,199 --> 01:42:57,326
Whatever happens, don't let go of the camera!

927
01:42:57,401 --> 01:42:59,460
Don't let go of the camera!

928
01:43:06,811 --> 01:43:09,075
Come on, get up out of that water.

929
01:43:10,014 --> 01:43:11,242
Get up!

930
01:43:51,569 --> 01:43:53,059
Come on, come on.

931
01:44:05,316 --> 01:44:07,284
Preston. Preston.

932
01:44:19,030 --> 01:44:20,520
It's working.

933
01:44:38,483 --> 01:44:40,542
Did you get that, did you?

934
01:45:40,878 --> 01:45:42,243
No!

935
01:45:42,981 --> 01:45:44,005
No.

936
01:45:48,519 --> 01:45:49,543
No.

937
01:46:39,971 --> 01:46:41,097
What is it?

938
01:46:45,877 --> 01:46:47,174
Mr. Hayes?

939
01:46:50,748 --> 01:46:53,342
If anything happens, I want you to run.

940
01:46:53,851 --> 01:46:55,113
You understand?

941
01:46:55,687 --> 01:46:58,656
I'm not a coward. I ain't gonna run.

942
01:47:00,191 --> 01:47:02,159
It's not about being brave, Jimmy.

943
01:47:30,788 --> 01:47:31,812
Go back!

944
01:47:33,858 --> 01:47:35,257
Back across the log!

945
01:47:35,460 --> 01:47:38,020
I ain't gonna run! Get Jimmy out of here!

946
01:47:38,263 --> 01:47:39,560
No! Get back! Get back!

947
01:47:44,469 --> 01:47:45,800
Move back!

948
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,014
No! No! Stay back.

949
01:48:03,721 --> 01:48:04,779
No!

950
01:48:10,061 --> 01:48:11,358
Look at me.

951
01:48:13,598 --> 01:48:16,158
Let him go! You got to run, Jimmy.

952
01:48:20,338 --> 01:48:21,703
Do as I say.

953
01:48:23,041 --> 01:48:24,440
Go with Jack.

954
01:48:26,878 --> 01:48:27,936
Run!

955
01:48:31,482 --> 01:48:33,916
No! Shoot him!

956
01:48:35,453 --> 01:48:36,442
No!

957
01:48:51,502 --> 01:48:54,300
Here! Over here!

958
01:49:12,423 --> 01:49:14,391
Hold on! Hold on!

959
01:49:18,496 --> 01:49:20,760
Lumpy! Help me!

960
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:24,399
Bloody hell, Choy!

961
01:54:46,057 --> 01:54:47,115
No!

962
01:54:51,295 --> 01:54:52,489
Oh, my!

963
02:01:27,958 --> 02:01:29,255
Wait!

964
02:02:18,775 --> 02:02:19,901
Carl.

965
02:02:24,982 --> 02:02:26,574
Jimmy. Jimmy.

966
02:02:27,451 --> 02:02:28,440
Jimmy.

967
02:02:29,553 --> 02:02:30,713
You all right?

968
02:03:20,671 --> 02:03:21,933
No.

969
02:04:14,424 --> 02:04:16,449
Get off! Get it off!

970
02:04:23,767 --> 02:04:24,791
Get off!

971
02:04:38,682 --> 02:04:39,774
Get it off!

972
02:04:40,150 --> 02:04:41,344
Get it off! Get it off!

973
02:05:45,716 --> 02:05:46,842
Kill it!

974
02:05:58,929 --> 02:06:00,328
Stop moving!

975
02:06:20,384 --> 02:06:22,113
Get it off my face!

976
02:06:23,086 --> 02:06:25,486
Stay still. I am standing still.

977
02:06:27,991 --> 02:06:29,788
Hold on. Be careful!

978
02:07:04,628 --> 02:07:07,256
Don't move! Stay away from the walls!

979
02:07:07,931 --> 02:07:09,455
Coming through!

980
02:07:17,908 --> 02:07:20,502
Get out of there now! Climb!

981
02:07:27,584 --> 02:07:29,381
Nobody get in my way.

982
02:07:32,489 --> 02:07:34,286
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

983
02:07:34,357 --> 02:07:36,848
Get up the rope. Let's go. Hurry up.

984
02:08:03,353 --> 02:08:05,617
Jimmy, let's go.

985
02:08:09,893 --> 02:08:11,520
Come on. Okay.

986
02:08:15,165 --> 02:08:16,154
Go.

987
02:08:21,071 --> 02:08:23,301
Just as you go down...

988
02:08:24,007 --> 02:08:26,475
for the third and final time...

989
02:08:27,410 --> 02:08:30,311
as your head disappears beneath the waves...

990
02:08:30,947 --> 02:08:33,177
and your lungs fill with water...

991
02:08:33,783 --> 02:08:37,981
do you know what happens in those last precious seconds before you drown?

992
02:08:38,154 --> 02:08:41,021
Come on, buddy. Get up the rope.
Come on. Get out of here. Come on.

993
02:08:41,091 --> 02:08:43,787
Your whole life passes before your eyes.

994
02:08:43,860 --> 02:08:46,328
And if you've lived as a true American...

995
02:08:46,596 --> 02:08:48,996
you get to watch it all in color.

996
02:08:49,833 --> 02:08:51,425
Oh, and you will.

997
02:08:51,501 --> 02:08:54,026
Now, why don't you climb up the rope, huh? Come on.

998
02:08:59,509 --> 02:09:01,636
Come on, Driscoll. Let's go.

999
02:11:56,319 --> 02:11:57,843
It's beautiful.

1000
02:12:19,309 --> 02:12:20,640
Beautiful.

1001
02:12:32,121 --> 02:12:33,452
Beautiful.

1002
02:13:20,870 --> 02:13:22,064
There.

1003
02:13:25,141 --> 02:13:26,233
Thank God.

1004
02:13:26,309 --> 02:13:28,277
Don't thank God. Thank Mr. Baxter.

1005
02:13:28,378 --> 02:13:30,346
He insisted on a rescue mission.

1006
02:13:31,681 --> 02:13:35,139
Me? I knew you'd be okay.

1007
02:13:36,452 --> 02:13:38,716
That's the thing about cockroaches.

1008
02:13:38,788 --> 02:13:42,224
No matter how many times you flush them down the toilet...

1009
02:13:42,291 --> 02:13:44,782
they always crawl back up the bowl.

1010
02:13:45,728 --> 02:13:48,561
Hey, buddy? I'm out of the bowl.

1011
02:13:49,332 --> 02:13:51,994
I'm drying off my wings and trekking across the lid.

1012
02:13:59,942 --> 02:14:01,170
Driscoll!

1013
02:14:02,645 --> 02:14:06,308
Don't be a fool! Give it up. It's useless!

1014
02:14:07,583 --> 02:14:08,948
She's dead.

1015
02:14:11,754 --> 02:14:13,312
She's not dead.

1016
02:14:17,226 --> 02:14:19,456
Jack's gonna bring her back...

1017
02:14:20,430 --> 02:14:23,024
and the ape will be hard on his heels.

1018
02:14:23,733 --> 02:14:26,258
We can still come out of this thing okay.

1019
02:14:28,871 --> 02:14:30,429
More than okay.

1020
02:14:31,674 --> 02:14:33,232
Think about it.

1021
02:14:33,309 --> 02:14:36,142
You got a boat full of chloroform we could put to good use.

1022
02:14:37,080 --> 02:14:38,980
You wanna trap the ape?

1023
02:14:45,822 --> 02:14:47,449
I don't think so.

1024
02:14:48,024 --> 02:14:51,460
Isn't that what you do? Live animal capture?

1025
02:14:52,962 --> 02:14:54,725
I heard you were the best.

1026
02:15:02,839 --> 02:15:03,965
Jack!

1027
02:15:07,043 --> 02:15:08,806
Look after yourself!

1028
02:15:09,445 --> 02:15:11,072
Keep the gate open, will you?

1029
02:15:11,447 --> 02:15:12,846
Sure thing, buddy.

1030
02:15:13,883 --> 02:15:15,214
Good luck!

1031
02:15:28,498 --> 02:15:29,863
I'm sorry.

1032
02:18:08,724 --> 02:18:09,782
Ann.

1033
02:19:18,327 --> 02:19:19,419
Jack!

1034
02:19:20,296 --> 02:19:21,388
Run!

1035
02:19:51,694 --> 02:19:53,321
Jack, Jack!

1036
02:20:01,036 --> 02:20:02,196
Jack.

1037
02:20:11,247 --> 02:20:13,215
Ann, it's okay.

1038
02:20:14,049 --> 02:20:16,449
Ann, let's go. Let's go. Come on!

1039
02:20:29,732 --> 02:20:31,097
Let's go. Come on.

1040
02:20:31,834 --> 02:20:33,062
Come on!

1041
02:22:05,327 --> 02:22:06,419
Carl!

1042
02:22:06,595 --> 02:22:09,291
Please! Somebody help us!

1043
02:22:11,433 --> 02:22:12,900
They've gone.

1044
02:22:14,470 --> 02:22:16,529
Carl. Christ.

1045
02:22:17,106 --> 02:22:18,198
Carl!

1046
02:22:19,041 --> 02:22:21,202
Drop the bridge. Do it now, for Christ's sake!

1047
02:22:21,277 --> 02:22:22,505
Not yet.

1048
02:22:23,946 --> 02:22:25,038
Wait.

1049
02:22:25,714 --> 02:22:26,806
Wait.

1050
02:22:30,953 --> 02:22:32,045
Wait!

1051
02:22:42,765 --> 02:22:43,993
Come on!

1052
02:23:56,472 --> 02:23:57,962
Now! Throw them!

1053
02:23:58,040 --> 02:23:59,439
Throw!

1054
02:24:00,309 --> 02:24:01,333
No!

1055
02:24:03,712 --> 02:24:04,940
Hold him!

1056
02:24:05,014 --> 02:24:06,504
Are you out of your mind?

1057
02:24:15,224 --> 02:24:17,351
Stop! Hold the line!

1058
02:24:18,093 --> 02:24:19,492
Keep him down!

1059
02:24:25,067 --> 02:24:26,056
Heave!

1060
02:24:27,102 --> 02:24:28,433
Please!

1061
02:24:28,904 --> 02:24:30,599
No! Stop!

1062
02:24:30,939 --> 02:24:31,928
Jack.

1063
02:24:33,008 --> 02:24:34,270
No. Get her out of...

1064
02:24:34,343 --> 02:24:36,243
They'll kill him! There's nothing we can do.

1065
02:24:36,311 --> 02:24:38,279
No! Get her out of his sight!

1066
02:24:38,347 --> 02:24:40,281
It's too late. Throw it!

1067
02:24:42,551 --> 02:24:43,643
Look out!

1068
02:24:45,954 --> 02:24:47,421
Let go of me.

1069
02:24:51,560 --> 02:24:53,187
We gotta go. Come on.

1070
02:24:53,762 --> 02:24:54,956
Come on. Stop it.

1071
02:24:55,030 --> 02:24:56,554
Leave me alone!

1072
02:24:57,733 --> 02:24:59,257
Ann, please come on.

1073
02:25:06,575 --> 02:25:08,406
Kill it! No. No!

1074
02:25:08,610 --> 02:25:10,874
It's over, you goddamn lunatic!

1075
02:25:13,082 --> 02:25:14,606
All of you, run!

1076
02:25:14,683 --> 02:25:16,344
Come on. Come on!

1077
02:25:33,102 --> 02:25:34,399
Look out!

1078
02:25:45,681 --> 02:25:47,308
Move it! Move it!

1079
02:25:49,685 --> 02:25:51,050
Come on, come on!

1080
02:25:59,962 --> 02:26:01,589
Stay there! It's me he wants!

1081
02:26:01,663 --> 02:26:03,858
Please stop this! Move! Hold onto her!

1082
02:26:03,932 --> 02:26:06,594
Ann, go. Please, I can stop this!

1083
02:26:06,668 --> 02:26:08,192
No! Ann, stay there!

1084
02:26:10,672 --> 02:26:12,071
Get it out!

1085
02:26:14,810 --> 02:26:16,675
Get the hell out of here!

1086
02:26:16,745 --> 02:26:18,736
Come on! Jimmy, don't be crazy! Come on.

1087
02:26:18,814 --> 02:26:20,111
Don't be crazy.

1088
02:26:21,316 --> 02:26:22,408
Let me go!

1089
02:26:23,752 --> 02:26:25,219
Cast off!

1090
02:26:27,523 --> 02:26:28,785
Come on, Carl!

1091
02:26:30,259 --> 02:26:32,090
Row! Wait.

1092
02:26:32,361 --> 02:26:34,488
Row, God damn it!

1093
02:26:44,740 --> 02:26:45,866
Go back.

1094
02:26:52,781 --> 02:26:53,907
Jimmy, no!

1095
02:27:00,889 --> 02:27:01,878
No!

1096
02:27:18,974 --> 02:27:20,805
No! Don't! Leave him alone!

1097
02:27:20,876 --> 02:27:22,400
Hide out in the back!

1098
02:27:44,967 --> 02:27:46,594
Wait! No!

1099
02:27:47,302 --> 02:27:49,896
No! No! Please don't!

1100
02:29:48,123 --> 02:29:50,648
The whole world will pay to see this.

1101
02:29:53,395 --> 02:29:55,386
We're millionaires, boys!

1102
02:29:55,697 --> 02:29:57,597
I'll share it with all of you!

1103
02:29:58,433 --> 02:30:02,927
In a few months his name will be up in lights on Broadway!

1104
02:30:05,107 --> 02:30:09,203
Kong! The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1105
02:31:09,671 --> 02:31:10,797
Mr. Denam!

1106
02:31:12,507 --> 02:31:14,532
What can I say? What can I say?

1107
02:31:14,609 --> 02:31:16,008
Any comments, Mr. Denam?

1108
02:31:17,345 --> 02:31:18,972
The Mayor, thank you.

1109
02:31:20,182 --> 02:31:21,171
Ready.

1110
02:31:21,349 --> 02:31:22,680
What am I?

1111
02:31:23,085 --> 02:31:24,814
Thank you very much.

1112
02:31:28,657 --> 02:31:30,147
Get used to it.

1113
02:31:30,358 --> 02:31:31,995
Listen, it's great to see you. Ready?

1114
02:31:32,095 --> 02:31:33,565
I'm really appreciating that...

1115
02:31:33,628 --> 02:31:35,095
Look at you! I remember you.

1116
02:31:35,163 --> 02:31:38,155
You're a lucky guy, Denam. Am I a lucky guy?

1117
02:31:38,233 --> 02:31:40,030
Maybe you're the lucky guy.

1118
02:31:53,849 --> 02:31:55,009
Carl!

1119
02:31:56,885 --> 02:31:58,079
Zelman! I told them.

1120
02:31:58,153 --> 02:31:59,620
I know you did and I appreciate it.

1121
02:31:59,688 --> 02:32:01,679
Let's get a shot of this.

1122
02:32:02,157 --> 02:32:03,283
Come on.

1123
02:32:04,025 --> 02:32:06,357
Big smile. Yeah! That's great!

1124
02:32:08,730 --> 02:32:11,665
Look at yourself. Look at what you've become.

1125
02:32:12,667 --> 02:32:14,931
No woman is worth this. This woman is worth it.

1126
02:32:15,003 --> 02:32:16,994
I don't care what it takes, I gotta win her back.

1127
02:32:17,072 --> 02:32:18,300
Oh, really?

1128
02:32:18,373 --> 02:32:20,034
She's not gonna buy this for a second.

1129
02:32:20,108 --> 02:32:22,303
Shut up and hand me the grapefruit!

1130
02:32:24,446 --> 02:32:27,108
You're writing a comedy? Yes, I an.

1131
02:32:27,849 --> 02:32:29,783
I'm writing it for you.

1132
02:32:31,720 --> 02:32:33,585
Why would you do that?

1133
02:32:34,589 --> 02:32:36,989
Why would I write a play for you?

1134
02:32:40,395 --> 02:32:42,022
Isn't it obvious?

1135
02:32:42,297 --> 02:32:43,787
Oh, I'm sorry.

1136
02:32:45,033 --> 02:32:46,898
I couldn't help but overhear.

1137
02:32:50,405 --> 02:32:53,135
So, he took me to this fancy French restaurant...

1138
02:32:53,208 --> 02:32:56,006
and halfway through the hors d'oeuvres, he clutches my hand.

1139
02:32:56,077 --> 02:32:58,272
And that's when he told you how he felt?

1140
02:32:58,346 --> 02:33:01,076
No. He never said it. He never said it?

1141
02:33:01,149 --> 02:33:03,117
He probably thought he didn't need to say it.

1142
02:33:03,185 --> 02:33:05,210
Well, then how does she know that it's real?

1143
02:33:05,287 --> 02:33:08,745
He said it was not about the words. Oh, please!

1144
02:33:08,957 --> 02:33:13,087
If you feel it, you say it. It's really very simple.

1145
02:33:13,461 --> 02:33:17,761
He said we'd talk about it later. Only there was no later.

1146
02:33:19,501 --> 02:33:21,059
It never happened.

1147
02:33:22,070 --> 02:33:23,833
That's how it ended.

1148
02:33:23,972 --> 02:33:27,703
He just let you walk away? He didn't try to save it?

1149
02:33:29,578 --> 02:33:32,945
I honestly believed things might actually work out...

1150
02:33:34,049 --> 02:33:36,040
which was really very...

1151
02:33:39,321 --> 02:33:40,549
foolish.

1152
02:33:40,789 --> 02:33:43,417
Men. Oh, they'll give you the world...

1153
02:33:43,491 --> 02:33:45,891
but they let the one thing that truly matters...

1154
02:33:45,961 --> 02:33:47,861
slip through their fingers.

1155
02:33:47,929 --> 02:33:49,157
Typical.

1156
02:33:49,764 --> 02:33:53,427
They're so busy being brave, they forget to use their brains.

1157
02:33:54,402 --> 02:33:56,302
Romance. Who needs it?

1158
02:34:21,029 --> 02:34:22,360
Thank you.

1159
02:34:23,198 --> 02:34:24,563
Thank you.

1160
02:34:27,502 --> 02:34:28,833
Thank you.

1161
02:34:30,639 --> 02:34:32,004
Thank you.

1162
02:34:33,808 --> 02:34:35,275
Ladies and gentlemen...

1163
02:34:36,878 --> 02:34:39,369
I'm here to tell you a very strange story.

1164
02:34:40,148 --> 02:34:41,877
The story of our adventure...

1165
02:34:42,717 --> 02:34:45,686
in which 17 of our party suffered horrible deaths...

1166
02:34:46,655 --> 02:34:48,145
their lives lost...

1167
02:34:48,923 --> 02:34:51,016
in pursuit of a savage beast...

1168
02:34:52,193 --> 02:34:54,787
a monstrous aberration of nature.

1169
02:34:56,031 --> 02:34:58,158
But even the meanest brute can be tamed.

1170
02:34:58,900 --> 02:35:01,198
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, as you will see...

1171
02:35:01,670 --> 02:35:03,331
the beast was no match...

1172
02:35:03,938 --> 02:35:05,496
for the charms of a girl.

1173
02:35:08,977 --> 02:35:10,569
A girl from New York...

1174
02:35:13,782 --> 02:35:15,579
Who melted his heart...

1175
02:35:16,284 --> 02:35:18,878
bringing to mind that old Arabian proverb...

1176
02:35:20,822 --> 02:35:23,985
"And lo, the beast looked upon the face of beauty...

1177
02:35:25,026 --> 02:35:26,926
"and beauty stayed his hand.

1178
02:35:28,229 --> 02:35:32,097
"And from that day forward, he was as one dead."

1179
02:35:39,874 --> 02:35:43,332
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to show you...

1180
02:35:43,478 --> 02:35:46,470
the greatest thing your eyes have ever beheld.

1181
02:35:47,615 --> 02:35:52,279
He was a king in the world he knew,
but he comes to you now a captive.

1182
02:35:53,488 --> 02:35:55,149
Ladies and gentlemen...

1183
02:35:55,223 --> 02:35:59,751
I give you Kong, The Eighth Wonder of the World!

1184
02:36:09,137 --> 02:36:12,265
Don't be alarmed. It's perfectly safe.

1185
02:36:12,574 --> 02:36:16,010
These chains are made of chrome steel!

1186
02:36:36,765 --> 02:36:38,562
Observe, if you will...

1187
02:36:41,836 --> 02:36:43,804
I am touching the beast.

1188
02:36:44,105 --> 02:36:48,337
I am actually laying my hand on the 25-foot gorilla.

1189
02:36:55,483 --> 02:36:57,110
Crank 'em up, fellas.

1190
02:37:16,438 --> 02:37:18,633
And now, we have in the auditorium tonight...

1191
02:37:18,706 --> 02:37:20,333
a surprise guest.

1192
02:37:21,142 --> 02:37:23,337
The real-life hero of this story.

1193
02:37:23,745 --> 02:37:26,179
The man who hunted down the mighty Kong!

1194
02:37:27,849 --> 02:37:32,616
The man who risked all to win the freedom of a helpless female.

1195
02:37:33,788 --> 02:37:36,120
A big hand for Mr. Bruce Baxter!

1196
02:37:41,996 --> 02:37:44,055
Thank you. Thank you.

1197
02:37:44,732 --> 02:37:45,892
Thank you.

1198
02:38:13,595 --> 02:38:15,028
He was right.

1199
02:38:16,598 --> 02:38:19,396
About there still being some mystery left in this world...

1200
02:38:20,568 --> 02:38:22,866
and we can all have a piece of it...

1201
02:38:23,238 --> 02:38:25,502
for the price of an admission ticket.

1202
02:38:27,075 --> 02:38:29,373
That's the thing you come to learn about Carl.

1203
02:38:31,479 --> 02:38:34,880
His unfailing ability to destroy the things he loves.

1204
02:38:49,330 --> 02:38:51,924
Please remain calm, ladies and gentlemen...

1205
02:38:52,000 --> 02:38:55,299
for we now come to the climax of this savage ritual.

1206
02:38:55,503 --> 02:38:57,994
The sacrifice of a beautiful young girl.

1207
02:38:58,773 --> 02:39:02,402
Behold her terror as she is offered up to the mighty Kong!

1208
02:39:03,645 --> 02:39:07,706
A big hand, folks, for the bravest girl I've ever met!

1209
02:39:08,449 --> 02:39:09,711
Miss Ann Darrow.

1210
02:39:57,699 --> 02:39:59,428
Save me from the beast!

1211
02:40:08,309 --> 02:40:09,537
Help me!

1212
02:40:13,681 --> 02:40:14,978
Where is she?

1213
02:40:16,150 --> 02:40:17,708
Where's Ann? I have no idea.

1214
02:40:17,785 --> 02:40:21,186
I heard he offered her all kinds of money and she turned him down flat.

1215
02:40:21,255 --> 02:40:25,954
# Pack up all my cares and woe #

1216
02:40:27,729 --> 02:40:29,162
# Here I go #

1217
02:40:30,498 --> 02:40:32,193
# singing low #

1218
02:40:34,435 --> 02:40:36,460
# Bye bye #

1219
02:40:38,873 --> 02:40:40,272
# Blackbird #

1220
02:40:45,546 --> 02:40:49,846
# Where somebody waits for me #

1221
02:40:51,319 --> 02:40:52,911
# sugar's sweet #

1222
02:40:54,355 --> 02:40:56,118
# so is he #

1223
02:40:58,459 --> 02:41:00,154
# Bye bye #

1224
02:41:02,296 --> 02:41:04,856
# Blackbird ##

1225
02:41:07,001 --> 02:41:08,332
here's your story, boys.

1226
02:41:08,403 --> 02:41:11,497
"Beauty and the man who saved her from the beast."

1227
02:41:17,245 --> 02:41:18,234
No.

1228
02:41:26,587 --> 02:41:28,452
We have to get these people out of here.

1229
02:41:28,523 --> 02:41:30,514
Everyone needs to leave, okay? Come on.

1230
02:41:32,260 --> 02:41:34,455
Let him roar. It makes a swell picture.

1231
02:41:36,297 --> 02:41:37,321
Head for the exits.

1232
02:41:37,398 --> 02:41:39,832
Get your own seat, buddy. You're not having mine.

1233
02:41:48,009 --> 02:41:49,237
Excuse me, fellows.

1234
02:41:50,178 --> 02:41:52,874
Coming through. Coming through, fellows.

1235
02:41:56,451 --> 02:41:59,443
Get me down! Help me, please!

1236
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:04,757
Somebody! Somebody help me!

1237
02:42:08,162 --> 02:42:10,824
Go! Go! Get out!

1238
02:42:14,802 --> 02:42:16,292
Go! Go!

1239
02:43:51,299 --> 02:43:53,733
There they are. Come on, come with me.

1240
02:44:06,547 --> 02:44:08,208
Go! Wait for me!

1241
02:44:09,116 --> 02:44:10,481
Go back!

1242
02:44:17,491 --> 02:44:18,753
This way!

1243
02:44:26,534 --> 02:44:27,694
Help!

1244
02:44:36,110 --> 02:44:37,099
No!

1245
02:45:17,018 --> 02:45:19,680
Taxi! Follow that ape.

1246
02:45:19,754 --> 02:45:21,244
Come on, pal, we gotta draw him off.

1247
02:45:21,322 --> 02:45:23,153
It's all yours, buddy.

1248
02:45:39,573 --> 02:45:41,302
Better get out of here, lady!

1249
02:46:02,029 --> 02:46:03,257
Come on.

1250
02:46:12,440 --> 02:46:13,429
Buddy!

1251
02:46:14,775 --> 02:46:17,005
Come on. Come on.

1252
02:46:35,796 --> 02:46:36,785
Look out.

1253
02:46:59,453 --> 02:47:00,681
Jesus Christ.

1254
02:52:24,244 --> 02:52:25,044
Fire!

1255
02:52:27,748 --> 02:52:28,840
Stop!

1256
02:52:44,198 --> 02:52:45,529
Listen up.

1257
02:52:45,599 --> 02:52:48,796
This is New York City, and this is sacred ground.

1258
02:52:48,869 --> 02:52:50,268
You hear me?

1259
02:52:50,771 --> 02:52:53,467
It was built for humans, by humans.

1260
02:52:53,540 --> 02:52:56,168
Not for stinking lice-infested apes.

1261
02:52:56,243 --> 02:52:58,074
The thought of some mutant gorilla...

1262
02:52:58,145 --> 02:53:02,479
crapping all over the streets of this fair city, fills me with disgust.

1263
02:53:02,750 --> 02:53:04,718
So this is how it's gonna be.

1264
02:53:04,785 --> 02:53:07,117
We find it. We kill it.

1265
02:53:07,454 --> 02:53:11,618
We cut its ugly head off and we ram it up...

1266
02:53:30,778 --> 02:53:32,336
No. No.

1267
02:56:03,897 --> 02:56:05,228
Beautiful.

1268
02:56:11,672 --> 02:56:12,730
Yes.

1269
02:56:15,375 --> 02:56:16,740
Yes, it is.

1270
03:01:10,136 --> 03:01:11,398
Look at that.

1271
03:01:13,340 --> 03:01:14,466
Hey! Hey!

1272
03:01:14,741 --> 03:01:16,368
Nobody past this point.

1273
03:01:17,611 --> 03:01:19,238
You can't go in there!

1274
03:01:20,580 --> 03:01:21,569
Hey!

1275
03:01:23,683 --> 03:01:24,980
Stop him!

1276
03:01:28,088 --> 03:01:30,352
Hey! Get back. You're not allowed up there!

1277
03:01:30,423 --> 03:01:32,084
What's going on? Go!

1278
03:05:13,980 --> 03:05:15,277
No!

1279
03:05:16,449 --> 03:05:18,610
No!

1280
03:05:25,592 --> 03:05:28,220
Please! No!

1281
03:05:28,595 --> 03:05:29,789
No!

1282
03:08:26,406 --> 03:08:28,704
Ann. Ann.

1283
03:09:18,024 --> 03:09:19,321
Move along.

1284
03:09:19,792 --> 03:09:21,692
Just one shot! One shot!

1285
03:09:22,362 --> 03:09:24,455
Come, come! Boys, how about a photo?

1286
03:09:24,530 --> 03:09:25,519
Look at me.

1287
03:09:25,631 --> 03:09:27,360
Come on, watch the camera.

1288
03:09:30,203 --> 03:09:31,727
Come a little closer.

1289
03:09:32,405 --> 03:09:34,600
That's it, folks. Show's over. Step back!

1290
03:09:34,674 --> 03:09:36,869
Clear the area. That's it. Shove off, boys.

1291
03:09:37,577 --> 03:09:39,135
Why'd he do that?

1292
03:09:39,445 --> 03:09:41,913
Climb up there and get himself cornered.

1293
03:09:41,981 --> 03:09:44,313
The ape must have known what was coming.

1294
03:09:44,384 --> 03:09:47,046
He's just a dumb animal. Didn't know nothing.

1295
03:09:53,259 --> 03:09:55,989
What does it matter? Airplanes got him.

1296
03:09:58,564 --> 03:10:00,532
It wasn't the airplanes.

1297
03:10:04,904 --> 03:10:07,038
It was beauty killed the beast.
