1
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,611
At last.

2
00:04:07,164 --> 00:04:10,791
Snoke trained you well.

3
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,085
I killed Snoke.

4
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,795
I'll kill you.

5
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:17,048
My boy.

6
00:04:18,008 --> 00:04:20,718
I made Snoke.

7
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,640
I have been every voice...

8
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,475
you have ever heard...

9
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:29,810
inside your head.

10
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:48,371
The First Order
was just the beginning.

11
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:53,376
I will give you so much more.

12
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,044
You'll die first.

13
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:57,755
I have died before.

14
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:02,468
The dark side of the Force
is a pathway...

15
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:06,639
to many abilities
some consider to be...

16
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:10,226
unnatural.

17
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:21,821
What could you give me?

18
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,490
Everything.

19
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:30,329
A new Empire.

20
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:57,606
The might of the Final Order
will soon be ready.

21
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:03,112
It will be yours
if you do as I ask.

22
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,490
Kill the girl!

23
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,784
End the Jedi...

24
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:13,164
and become what your
grandfather Vader could not.

25
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:20,087
You will rule all the galaxy...

26
00:06:20,172 --> 00:06:22,923
as the new emperor.

27
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,551
But beware...

28
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:28,637
she is not who you think she is.

29
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,893
Who is she?

30
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,126
Are you ever gonna go?

31
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,692
- He can't beat us every time.
- Apparently he does.

32
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,716
How does he do it?

33
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:07,278
This guy right here?
It's 'cause he cheats.

34
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,636
I'm kidding!

35
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,114
- Oh, come on. Take your turn.
- You're 250 years old.

36
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,199
You're taking forever.
That's cheating.

37
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,241
Of course you're better than us.

38
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,665
That's why we think
you're cheating.

39
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,229
- Don't worry!
- We're not gonna turn it off.

40
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:21,273
- He's cheating.
- Definitely.

41
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,652
Klaud, I hope
you fixed that surge.

42
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:33,536
T-minus five.

43
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,703
Artoo.

44
00:07:47,384 --> 00:07:50,052
Boolio, good to see you.
You got something for us?

45
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,888
From a new ally!
A spy in the First Order!

46
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:55,891
A spy? Who?

47
00:07:56,059 --> 00:07:57,268
I don't know!

48
00:07:57,352 --> 00:08:00,354
Transfer the message!
Get it to Leia, hurry!

49
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,941
This could be big, Artoo.

50
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,203
Locked on target.

51
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,163
Finn, we're about to be cooked!

52
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,582
We're almost there!

53
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,459
Poe, we got it.

54
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,794
How do we thank you?

55
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:25,671
Win the war!

56
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,513
Sorry, I'm sorry! I know!

57
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,108
Finn, you're supposed to be
getting rid of those things!

58
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,152
Ooh!

59
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:51,488
- I got one!
- How many are left?

60
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,740
Too many.

61
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,825
What?

62
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,122
Good thinking, Chewie.

63
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,624
Finn, we can boulder these TIEs!

64
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,250
I was just thinking that.

65
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:16,889
Ha!

66
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,599
Get us back to base!

67
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,161
How thick do you think
that ice wall is?

68
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:33,197
- Poe!
- I know, I know!

69
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,535
What are you doing?

70
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:39,703
Lightspeed skipping.

71
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:41,997
How do you know how to do that?

72
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,964
Yeah, well,
Rey's not here, is she?

73
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,597
Last jump, maybe forever.

74
00:09:58,682 --> 00:10:00,599
Hold on!

75
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,906
Be with me.

76
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,619
Be with me.

77
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,498
Be with me.

78
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:28,711
They're not with me. Ugh.

79
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,718
Rey.

80
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,302
Be patient.

81
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:39,388
I'm starting to think
it isn't possible...

82
00:10:39,556 --> 00:10:41,515
to hear voices of the Jedi
who came before.

83
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:43,392
Nothing's impossible.

84
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,310
Nothing's impossible.

85
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,021
I'm gonna run
the training course.

86
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,910
No!

87
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,078
Join me.

88
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,746
Join me.

89
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:29,373
Ben, no!

90
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:30,457
You killed him!

91
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,917
Ben!

92
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,682
BB-8, I'm so sorry.

93
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:52,104
I didn't finish
the training course.

94
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:54,022
Got distracted.

95
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,280
I'm just not feeling myself.

96
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,282
I know it looks...

97
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,617
It looks like
I'm making excuses.

98
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,786
Don't tell me
what things look like.

99
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:09,079
Tell me what they are.

100
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,792
I think I'm just tired.
That's all.

101
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,545
General...

102
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,797
the Falcon still hasn't arrived.

103
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,549
Commander's asking for guidance.

104
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:26,471
I will earn
your brother's saber...

105
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,223
one day.

106
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,478
No, you can't do it for me.

107
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,856
Never underestimate a droid.

108
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:39,860
Yes, Master.

109
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:49,786
Rey!

110
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,788
Falcon's back!

111
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,292
Come on, get over here!

112
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:56,710
I need a fire crew here!

113
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,962
And another one in the back!
Go, go!

114
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,505
Coming!

115
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:01,965
It's on fire!

116
00:14:03,134 --> 00:14:04,843
Whole thing's on fire.
All of it.

117
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:06,094
- It's on fire.
- Hey.

118
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,554
- Hey!
- There's a spy?

119
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,473
Really could have used
your help out there.

120
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:10,557
How'd it go?

121
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,434
Really bad, actually.
Really bad.

122
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,278
- Han's ship...
- What'd you do to the droid?

123
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,640
What'd you do to the Falcon?

124
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:17,416
The Falcon's in
a lot better shape than he is.

125
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
BB-8's not on fire.

126
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,816
What's left of him
isn't on fire.

127
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,587
- Tell me what happened.
- You tell me first.

128
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:22,851
- You know what you are?
- What?

129
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,279
You're difficult.
Really difficult.

130
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,841
- You're a difficult man.
- You, you are...

131
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,658
- Rey.
- Finn. Oh.

132
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:29,076
You made it back.

133
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,202
Yeah. Barely.

134
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,496
- So, bad mood?
- Me?

135
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,039
- Him.
- Always.

136
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:35,916
Do we have a spy?

137
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,376
Well...

138
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:39,002
You lightspeed skipped?

139
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,397
Yeah, well, it got us
back here, didn't it?

140
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,630
Poe, the compressor's down.

141
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,548
- Oh, I know, I was there.
- Every time.

142
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,818
You can't lightspeed skip
the Falcon!

143
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,134
Actually, it turns out you can.

144
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,803
All right, guys,
we just landed, okay?

145
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,887
What happened?

146
00:14:48,972 --> 00:14:50,032
Bad news, that's what happened.

147
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,056
No spy?

148
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,140
No. Spy.

149
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:53,788
Did we make contact
with a spy or not?

150
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:54,912
There's a mole
in the First Order,

151
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,019
and they sent us a message.

152
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,312
You dropped a tree on him?

153
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:58,499
You blew both sub-alternators?

154
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,523
Well, you know what...

155
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,668
maybe you should've been
out there with us!

156
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:01,752
You know
I wanna be out there with you.

157
00:15:01,776 --> 00:15:02,776
Yeah, but you're not.

158
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,152
You're here training. For what?

159
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,446
You're the best fighter we have.

160
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,323
We need you.

161
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,825
Out there, not here.

162
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,243
Junior...

163
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:12,805
get Artoo into reconditioning.

164
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:13,829
It's true.

165
00:15:16,082 --> 00:15:17,249
What's the message?

166
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:21,086
We've decoded the intel
from the First Order spy...

167
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:22,921
and it confirms the worst.

168
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:26,967
Somehow, Palpatine returned.

169
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,598
Wait. Do we believe this?

170
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,183
It cannot be.

171
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,393
The Emperor is dead.

172
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,812
Dark science. Cloning.

173
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,519
Secrets only the Sith knew.

174
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,399
He's been planning his revenge.

175
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:45,777
His followers have been
building something for years.

176
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,031
The largest fleet
the galaxy has ever known.

177
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,576
He calls it the Final Order.

178
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:56,163
In 16 hours, attacks
on all free worlds begin.

179
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:59,184
The Emperor and his fleet
have been hiding

180
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,375
in the Unknown Regions.

181
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,669
On a world called Exegol.

182
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:08,675
Exegol does not appear
on any star chart.

183
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:13,180
But legend describes it as
the hidden world of the Sith.

184
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,682
There were always whispers

185
00:16:15,767 --> 00:16:17,225
of his hunger to cheat death.

186
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:20,437
So, Palpatine's been out there
all this time.

187
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,105
Pulling the strings.

188
00:16:22,273 --> 00:16:24,691
Always. In the shadows.
From the very beginning.

189
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:28,278
If we want to stop him,
we must find him.

190
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,114
Must find Exegol.

191
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,449
General?

192
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:35,869
Can I speak with you?

193
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,621
I know how to get to Exegol.

194
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,915
- Tell me.
- Luke searched for it.

195
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,292
For a long time.
He nearly found it.

196
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,378
There are ciphers here
I can't read.

197
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,381
But he said to get there,
you need one of these.

198
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,840
A Sith wayfinder.

199
00:16:49,509 --> 00:16:51,968
They're compasses
that lead the way to Exegol.

200
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,513
To stop
what we both know is coming...

201
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,057
I need to finish
what Luke started.

202
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,267
Find Exegol.

203
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,727
Find the Emperor.

204
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:02,020
No.

205
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:05,690
I don't want to go without
your blessing, but I will.

206
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,444
I will.

207
00:17:10,822 --> 00:17:12,406
It's what you would do.

208
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,386
So, you got her up and running?

209
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,493
You were right before.

210
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,079
I'm gonna pick up
Luke's search for Exegol.

211
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,331
I'm gonna start
where his trail went cold.

212
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,041
The Forbidden Desert of Pasaana.

213
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:25,001
Yeah, I know.
We're going with you.

214
00:17:25,837 --> 00:17:27,712
Chewie, you get
that compressor fixed?

215
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,631
I need to go alone.

216
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,799
Yeah. Alone with friends.

217
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,050
It's too dangerous, Finn.

218
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,969
We go together.

219
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,891
I wholeheartedly agree.

220
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,815
Rose, last chance.

221
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,180
The General asked me to study
the specs of old Destroyers.

222
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,546
So we can stop the fleet
if you find it.

223
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,570
"If"?

224
00:17:51,654 --> 00:17:53,488
When.

225
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:55,657
When.

226
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,959
Hey, we should get going.

227
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,421
What is it?

228
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,256
Nothing.

229
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,301
In the event
that I do not return...

230
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:15,927
I want you to know

231
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:18,597
that you have been
a real friend, Artoo.

232
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,183
My best one, in fact.

233
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:28,982
There's so much
I want to tell you.

234
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,652
Tell me when you get back.

235
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:55,759
Rey...

236
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:58,762
never be afraid of who you are.

237
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,409
It is.

238
00:20:10,084 --> 00:20:11,126
Knights of Ren.

239
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,210
Ghouls.

240
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,216
We have a spy in our ranks...

241
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,011
who just sent a message
to the Resistance.

242
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,806
Whoever this traitor is
won't stop us.

243
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:28,268
With what I've seen on Exegol...

244
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:31,605
the First Order is about to
become a true Empire.

245
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:39,362
I sense unease about
my appearance, General Hux.

246
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:44,284
About the mask?

247
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,661
No, sir. Well done.

248
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:47,996
I like it.

249
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:52,250
Forgive me, sir,
but these allies on Exegol...

250
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,585
they sound like a cult.

251
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,629
Conjurers and soothsayers.

252
00:20:55,713 --> 00:20:57,964
They've conjured
legions of Star Destroyers.

253
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,133
The Sith fleet
will increase our resources

254
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,259
ten-thousandfold.

255
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,179
Such range and power
will correct the error

256
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,972
of Starkiller Base.

257
00:21:06,057 --> 00:21:07,724
We'll need
to increase recruitments.

258
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,726
Harvest more of
the galaxy's young.

259
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,936
This fleet, what is it, a gift?

260
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:14,147
What is he asking for in return?

261
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,236
Prepare to crush
any worlds that defy us.

262
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:22,280
My knights and I
are going hunting

263
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,907
for the scavenger.

264
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,918
You sure this is it?

265
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,795
These are the exact coordinates

266
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,088
that Master Luke left behind.

267
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,137
What is this?

268
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,890
The Acky Acky Festival
of the Ancestors.

269
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:52,811
This celebration occurs
only once every 42 years.

270
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,978
Well, that's lucky.

271
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,522
Lucky indeed.

272
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,191
This festival is known
for both its colourful kites...

273
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,360
and its delectable sweets.

274
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,883
I've never seen
anything like this.

275
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,760
I've never seen
so few wayfinders.

276
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:27,804
There's always random
First Order patrols

277
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,180
in crowds like these.

278
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,807
So, keep your heads down.

279
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:31,975
Chewie.

280
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:39,441
Let's split up.
See what the locals know.

281
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,505
She is saying, "Welcome."

282
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,641
Her name is Nambi Ghima.

283
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,186
That's an excellent name.
I'm Rey.

284
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,024
She would be honoured
to know your family name, too.

285
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,612
I don't have one.

286
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,030
I'm just Rey.

287
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:49,093
Palpatine wants you dead.

288
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,056
- Serving another master?
- No.

289
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:55,600
I have other plans.

290
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:58,311
I offered you my hand once.

291
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,772
You wanted to take it.

292
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,191
Why didn't you?

293
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,194
You could've killed me.

294
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,737
Why didn't you?

295
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,990
You can't hide, Rey.

296
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,242
Not from me.

297
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:16,371
I see through the cracks
in your mask.

298
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,039
You're haunted.

299
00:24:18,207 --> 00:24:21,292
You can't stop seeing
what you did to your father.

300
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,586
Do you still count the days

301
00:24:23,671 --> 00:24:25,088
since your parents left?

302
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:29,509
Such pain in you, such anger.

303
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,136
I don't wanna have to kill you.

304
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:34,430
I'm going to find you

305
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,432
and I'm going to turn you
to the dark side.

306
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,186
When I offer you
my hand again...

307
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:42,146
you'll take it.

308
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,108
We'll see.

309
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,323
Has he seen him?

310
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,826
We have to go.
Back to the Falcon. Now.

311
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,494
- Why?
- It's Ren.

312
00:24:58,831 --> 00:25:00,290
Sir, we've had this analysed.

313
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,083
It comes
from the Middian System,

314
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,376
Pasaana, Forbidden Valley.

315
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,544
Prepare my ship.

316
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,588
Alert the local troops.
Send a division.

317
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,257
Yes, Supreme Leader.

318
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,219
Freeze.

319
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,596
Hold it right there.

320
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,347
I've located
the Resistance fugitives.

321
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,473
All units, report...

322
00:25:23,272 --> 00:25:24,439
Follow me.

323
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,032
Hurry.

324
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:37,577
Leia sent me a transmission.

325
00:25:38,412 --> 00:25:40,455
Okay.

326
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:42,540
How'd you find us?

327
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,336
Wookiees stand out in a crowd.

328
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,467
It's good to see you too,
old buddy.

329
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,844
This is
General Lando Calrissian.

330
00:25:54,929 --> 00:25:55,989
We know who he is, Threepio.

331
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,639
It is an honour, General.

332
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,642
General Calrissian,
we're looking for Exegol.

333
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,771
Of course you are.

334
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,733
Only two were made.

335
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,860
A Sith wayfinder.

336
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,654
Luke Skywalker came here
to find one.

337
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,156
I know. I was with him.

338
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,117
Luke and I were tailing
an old Jedi hunter.

339
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,745
Ochi of Bestoon.

340
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,288
He was carrying a clue

341
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,332
that could lead to a wayfinder.

342
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,502
We followed his ship halfway
across the galaxy here.

343
00:26:27,878 --> 00:26:30,004
When we got to his ship,
it was abandoned...

344
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,674
No clue. No wayfinder.

345
00:26:33,175 --> 00:26:34,342
Is Ochi's ship still here?

346
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,302
It's out in the desert,
where he left it.

347
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:38,429
We need to get to that ship.
Search it again.

348
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:49,273
I got a bad feeling about this.

349
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:52,026
Ochi's ship
is out past Lurch Canyon.

350
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:53,861
- Go.
- Thank you, General.

351
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,280
You too, Chewie.

352
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,116
Leia needs pilots, General.

353
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,035
My flying days are long gone.

354
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,704
But do me a favour...

355
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,957
give Leia my love.

356
00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:08,376
You should
give it to her yourself.

357
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,627
Thank you.

358
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:19,262
There! Those speeders.

359
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,024
How do you know how to do that?

360
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,984
No need to worry. I made it.

361
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:36,904
We gotta go.

362
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,370
We've spotted the fugitives.

363
00:28:03,766 --> 00:28:06,309
Oh! They fly now!

364
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,685
They fly now?

365
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:09,437
They fly now.

366
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,754
Did we lose them?

367
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,589
- Looks like it!
- Excellent job, sir!

368
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:41,260
Terrible job, sir!

369
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,767
Not now, BB-8.

370
00:29:00,697 --> 00:29:02,824
Never underestimate a droid.

371
00:29:22,845 --> 00:29:23,845
Poe!

372
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:29,851
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

373
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,144
Right, ho!

374
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,409
Ochi's ship.

375
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,328
I've seen that ship before.

376
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:50,413
Rey!

377
00:29:50,581 --> 00:29:51,706
You get all of them?

378
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,563
What the hell is this?

379
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:19,567
Sinking fields!
Try to grab something!

380
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,986
Will this agony ever end?

381
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:23,529
Come on!

382
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,531
BB-8! No!

383
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,616
Rey.

384
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,117
Rey, I never told you...

385
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:29,827
What? Finn!

386
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,841
General.

387
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,069
We're getting reports of a raid

388
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,237
at the Festival of Ancestors.

389
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,971
This mission is everything.
We cannot fail.

390
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,765
Any word from Rey?

391
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,016
Falcon's not responding.

392
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,173
Do you have to say it like that?

393
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,311
Like what?

394
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,730
Do me a personal favour?
Be optimistic.

395
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,106
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:01,359
Uh, this is... This is terrific.

397
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,171
You're not gonna believe how
well this is gonna turn out.

398
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,737
It's gonna be great.

399
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,622
Rey! Finn!

400
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:16,874
You didn't say my name,
sir, but I'm all right.

401
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,298
- You all right?
- Yeah.

402
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,383
Where's Finn?

403
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:26,467
Where's Chewie?

404
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,553
I'm good.

405
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:30,972
Ah. Master Finn.

406
00:31:31,056 --> 00:31:32,139
What is this place?

407
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:33,808
This isn't the afterlife, is it?

408
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,976
Are droids allowed here?

409
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
I thought we were goners.

410
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,353
We might still be.

411
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:38,854
Which way out?

412
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,654
We have to hurry.

413
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,823
- So, what was it?
- What?

414
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,866
- What you were gonna tell me?
- When?

415
00:31:50,951 --> 00:31:52,387
When you were sinking
in the sand, you said...

416
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:53,786
"I never told you..."

417
00:31:54,955 --> 00:31:56,038
I'll tell you later.

418
00:31:56,123 --> 00:31:57,415
You mean when Poe's not here?

419
00:31:58,041 --> 00:31:59,166
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

420
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:00,353
We're gonna die in sand burrows

421
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,577
and we're all keeping secrets?

422
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:02,772
I'll tell you when you tell us

423
00:32:02,796 --> 00:32:04,156
about all that shifty stuff
you do.

424
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,383
I do not wanna know
what made these tunnels.

425
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,634
Judging by the circumference

426
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:09,844
of the tunnel walls...

427
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,178
I said I do not wanna know.

428
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,680
Not.

429
00:32:12,848 --> 00:32:13,848
What's that?

430
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,224
- Is that a speeder?
- What?

431
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,392
An old one.

432
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,852
Perhaps we will find the driver.

433
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,813
Yep, BB-8, I think dead, too.

434
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:23,316
Oh, my. A hex charm.

435
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,400
A what?

436
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,819
A common emblem
of Sith loyalists.

437
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:28,029
Sith.

438
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,322
This was Ochi's?

439
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:31,824
Luke sensed it.
Ochi never left this place.

440
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:33,993
And he ended up down here.

441
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,286
He was headed for his ship.

442
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:37,265
Same thing happened to us,
happened to him.

443
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,581
So, how did Ochi get out?

444
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:39,665
He didn't.

445
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,212
No, he didn't.

446
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:46,630
Bones.

447
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,049
I don't like bones.

448
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,551
Bones? Never a good sign.

449
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:53,888
Yeah, I see it.

450
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,152
Horrible things...

451
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,112
have happened with this.

452
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,322
There's writing on it.

453
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,824
Perhaps I can translate.

454
00:33:14,368 --> 00:33:17,244
Oh. The location
of the wayfinder,

455
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,538
has been inscribed
upon this dagger.

456
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:22,249
It's the clue that Master Luke
was looking for.

457
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:23,918
- And?
- Where's the wayfinder?

458
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:26,837
I am afraid I cannot tell you.

459
00:33:27,381 --> 00:33:29,382
20.3 fazillion languages,
you can't read that?

460
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:30,925
Oh, I have read it, sir.

461
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,136
I know exactly
where the wayfinder is.

462
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,430
Unfortunately, it is written

463
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,265
in the runic language
of the Sith.

464
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,433
So what?

465
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:41,936
My programming forbids
me from translating it.

466
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,331
So, you're telling us
the one time

467
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,814
we need you to talk, you can't?

468
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:46,107
Irony, sir.

469
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,401
I am mechanically incapable

470
00:33:48,485 --> 00:33:50,152
of speaking translations
from Sith.

471
00:33:50,237 --> 00:33:51,612
I believe the rule was passed

472
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:53,697
by the Senate of
the Old Republic...

473
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:58,369
Serpent! Serpent! Serpent!

474
00:34:10,924 --> 00:34:13,342
Rey.

475
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,601
- Finn.
- Shh.

476
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:40,973
- I'm gonna blast it.
- Don't blast it.

477
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,250
I just transferred
a bit of life.

478
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,723
Force energy from me to him.

479
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,142
You would've done the same.

480
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,500
We cannot possibly fly
in that old wreck.

481
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,668
We gotta keep moving.

482
00:36:10,752 --> 00:36:12,670
Find someone
who can translate that dagger.

483
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:13,837
Like a helpful droid.

484
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:17,091
I suggest we return to
the Millennium Falcon at once.

485
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:18,569
They'll be waiting for us
at the Falcon.

486
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,273
Yeah, they'll throw us
in the Pits of Griq.

487
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,846
Yeah.
And use you as a target droid.

488
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,849
You both make
excellent points, at times.

489
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,980
What is it?

490
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,524
I'll be right behind you.

491
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:35,401
It's okay.

492
00:36:45,328 --> 00:36:46,620
Let's see what we got.

493
00:36:48,582 --> 00:36:50,499
Let's get
those converters fired up.

494
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:58,799
What a filthy ship!

495
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,552
Look at that.

496
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:03,846
Where is she?

497
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,728
Finn, help me out over here.

498
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,272
Chewie, tell Rey we gotta go.

499
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:02,863
What's she doing?

500
00:38:03,365 --> 00:38:04,615
Where the hell's Chewie?

501
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,661
It's Ren.

502
00:38:24,177 --> 00:38:25,511
All right, let's go.

503
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:27,471
Get in the transport.

504
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,722
Move, animal!

505
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:45,507
Rey!

506
00:39:46,134 --> 00:39:47,134
Rey!

507
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:51,430
They got Chewie! They got him!

508
00:40:59,374 --> 00:41:00,415
Chewie!

509
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:01,542
No!

510
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:08,048
Rey!

511
00:41:10,635 --> 00:41:12,302
We gotta go! They're coming!

512
00:41:13,054 --> 00:41:14,429
Rey, come on!

513
00:41:17,559 --> 00:41:18,559
Rey!

514
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:22,396
- We gotta go!
- Chewie.

515
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,356
Rey, come on!

516
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,212
I lost control.

517
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,840
It wasn't your fault.

518
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,924
It was.

519
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,260
No. It was Ren.
He made you do it.

520
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:54,720
Chewie's gone.

521
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,264
That power came from me.

522
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,267
Finn, there are things
you don't know.

523
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,353
Then tell me.

524
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:11,987
I, uh, had a vision.

525
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,491
Of the throne of the Sith.

526
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:19,494
And who was on it.

527
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,330
Ren?

528
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,208
And me.

529
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,934
We recovered
the scavenger's ship,

530
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,101
but she got away.

531
00:42:43,645 --> 00:42:45,145
Under command
of the Knights of Ren,

532
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:46,438
we suffered losses.

533
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:48,774
- A transport was destroyed.
- I've seen the report.

534
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:50,484
That all?

535
00:42:51,152 --> 00:42:52,653
No, Allegiant General.

536
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,460
There was another transport
in the desert.

537
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:58,116
It brought back
a valuable prisoner.

538
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,328
Prisoner?

539
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,002
The beast used to fly
with Han Solo.

540
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,215
Take it to Interrogation Six.

541
00:43:13,383 --> 00:43:14,800
Move it.

542
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:17,052
We've only got eight hours left.

543
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,387
So, what are we gonna do?

544
00:43:18,471 --> 00:43:20,071
What can we do?
We gotta go back to base.

545
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,117
We don't have time to go back.
We are not giving up.

546
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,725
If we do that,
Chewie died for nothing.

547
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,060
Poe, Chewie had the dagger!

548
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,497
Well, then we gotta find
another way.

549
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:27,665
Well, there isn't.
That was the only clue

550
00:43:27,689 --> 00:43:29,272
to the wayfinder thing,
and it's gone.

551
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,357
So true.

552
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:32,818
The inscription lives
only in my memory now.

553
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:35,904
Hold on.

554
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,282
The inscription that was on
the dagger is in your memory?

555
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:41,034
Yes, Master Poe.

556
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:43,120
But the translation
from a forbidden language

557
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:44,621
cannot be retrieved.

558
00:43:44,706 --> 00:43:47,499
That is short of a complete
redacted memory bypass.

559
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:48,709
A complete what?

560
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,544
It's a terribly
dangerous and sinful act...

561
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:53,171
performed on unwitting droids
by dregs and criminals.

562
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,464
Let's do that.

563
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:56,383
I know
a black market droidsmith.

564
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:57,592
Black market droidsmith?

565
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,597
- But he's on Kijimi.
- What's wrong with Kijimi?

566
00:43:59,804 --> 00:44:01,304
I had a little bad luck
on Kijimi.

567
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:06,018
But if this mission fails,
it's all been for nothing.

568
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,687
All we've done, all this time.

569
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,607
We're all in this.

570
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:15,318
Until the end.

571
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:20,741
For Chewie.

572
00:44:22,744 --> 00:44:24,161
- Hands?
- Hands.

573
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,621
For Chewie.

574
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:32,586
Kijimi.

575
00:45:06,579 --> 00:45:08,246
Battery charged.

576
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:10,582
Hello.

577
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,713
Hello.

578
00:45:17,298 --> 00:45:18,882
- Hello.
- No... No, thank you.

579
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,595
Looks like
someone treated him badly.

580
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,681
It's all right.
You're with us now.

581
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,067
U-A-T-T walker patrol,

582
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,568
head down thoroughfare 60.

583
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,877
Open up.
You're wanted for questioning.

584
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,217
Check this side of the street.

585
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:07,722
Door is locked.

586
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,015
Move on to the next one.

587
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,268
Give me regular reports, please.

588
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,603
You, up against the wall.

589
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,355
Show me your identification.

590
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,357
Where is your identification?

591
00:46:18,818 --> 00:46:20,026
They're everywhere.

592
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:22,297
Please, leave her alone.
She didn't do anything.

593
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,715
All right,
I know what we should do.

594
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,240
So do I. We should leave.

595
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,741
Clam it, Threepio.

596
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,160
Follow me.

597
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:37,794
All right.
Let's head down this way.

598
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,590
Heard you were
spotted at Monk's Gate.

599
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:44,509
Thought, "He's not stupid
enough to come back here."

600
00:46:44,594 --> 00:46:46,136
Oh, you'd be surprised.

601
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,679
- Who's this?
- What's going on?

602
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:49,931
Guys, this is Zorii.
Zorii, this is Rey and Finn.

603
00:46:50,016 --> 00:46:51,683
I could pull
this trigger right now.

604
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,287
- I've seen you do worse.
- For a lot less.

605
00:46:53,311 --> 00:46:55,937
Can we just, uh...
talk about this?

606
00:46:56,397 --> 00:46:57,898
I wanna see your brains
in the snow.

607
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,774
So, you're still mad?

608
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,359
Zorii, we could use your help.

609
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:03,172
We gotta crack this droid's
head open and fast.

610
00:47:03,196 --> 00:47:04,279
Pardon me!

611
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:05,424
We're trying to find Babu Frik.

612
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,717
Babu? Babu only works
with the crew.

613
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,116
That's not you any more.

614
00:47:08,201 --> 00:47:09,242
What crew?

615
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:10,785
Oh, funny he never mentioned it.

616
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:13,413
Your friend's old job
was running spice.

617
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:14,623
You were a spice runner?

618
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,935
- You were a stormtrooper?
- Were you a spice runner?

619
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,437
Were you a scavenger?
We could do this all night.

620
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:19,753
You don't have all night.

621
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:22,255
You know, I'm still digging
out of the hole you put me in

622
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,049
when you left
to join the Resistance.

623
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:25,926
You.

624
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:27,745
You're the one
they're looking for.

625
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:30,138
Bounty for her
just might cover us.

626
00:47:30,223 --> 00:47:31,806
- Djak'kankah!
- Don't djak'kankah.

627
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:41,066
We could really use your help.

628
00:47:41,234 --> 00:47:42,484
Please.

629
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,446
Not that you care...

630
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:48,740
but I think you're okay.

631
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:50,659
I care.

632
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,248
T-18's online yet?

633
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:57,874
Yes, sir.
Scouting the perimeter.

634
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:01,544
Walkers. Stay close by.

635
00:48:03,923 --> 00:48:06,800
Poe Dameron,
spice runner. Runner of spice.

636
00:48:06,968 --> 00:48:08,593
- All right.
- Get your spice!

637
00:48:08,678 --> 00:48:10,220
- Come on, Threepio.
- Oh.

638
00:48:25,278 --> 00:48:26,695
Babu's in the back.

639
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:38,290
Don't mind us.

640
00:48:42,837 --> 00:48:45,964
I haven't the faintest idea
why I agreed to this.

641
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:47,757
I must be malfunctioning.

642
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,509
I must be malfunctioning.

643
00:48:50,594 --> 00:48:51,845
Babu Frik?

644
00:48:52,013 --> 00:48:53,430
Can you help us with this?

645
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,062
Zorii? Is this gonna work?

646
00:49:07,695 --> 00:49:08,797
He says he's found something

647
00:49:08,821 --> 00:49:10,132
in your droid's
forbidden memory bank.

648
00:49:10,156 --> 00:49:12,115
Words, translated from Sith.

649
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:14,034
- That's it.
- Yeah, that's what we need.

650
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,494
Who are you hanging out
with that speaks Sith?

651
00:49:16,996 --> 00:49:18,204
Can you make him...

652
00:49:18,706 --> 00:49:20,874
Babu, can you make him
translate it?

653
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,004
Yes. But it will
cause a complete...

654
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,756
A complete memory wipe.

655
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,600
Wait, wait, wait.
We make him translate it...

656
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,926
he won't remember... anything?

657
00:49:32,094 --> 00:49:34,054
Droid, memory go blank.

658
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,221
- Oh!
- Blank, blank.

659
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:36,514
There must be some other way.

660
00:49:36,599 --> 00:49:37,932
Doesn't Artoo back up
your memory?

661
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:39,017
Oh, please.

662
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,978
Artoo's storage units
are famously unreliable.

663
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,397
You know the odds
better than any of us.

664
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,817
Do we have a choice?

665
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,076
If this mission fails...

666
00:49:56,869 --> 00:49:58,536
it was all for nothing.

667
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,414
All we've done...

668
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,875
all this time.

669
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:10,199
What are you doing there,
Threepio?

670
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:13,885
Taking one last look, sir...

671
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,513
at my friends.

672
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:20,558
Sad.

673
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:25,021
Uh-oh.

674
00:50:25,106 --> 00:50:26,773
Night raids
are gonna start soon.

675
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,537
- I'll keep lookout.
- I'm coming with you.

676
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,985
You still don't trust me, huh?

677
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,195
Did you ever trust me?

678
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,321
Nope.

679
00:50:38,911 --> 00:50:40,328
Report, General Pryde.

680
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:41,693
There's been a development, sir.

681
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,748
The Knights of Ren
have tracked the scavenger.

682
00:50:43,916 --> 00:50:45,625
To a settlement called Kijimi.

683
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,794
Shall we destroy the city,

684
00:50:47,878 --> 00:50:49,045
Supreme...?

685
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,261
I just had an idea.

686
00:50:56,345 --> 00:50:57,804
There's something else
we could try.

687
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,487
How long's it been like this?

688
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:17,699
First Order took most
of the kids a long time ago.

689
00:51:17,867 --> 00:51:19,951
Can't stand the cries any more.

690
00:51:20,119 --> 00:51:22,036
I've saved up enough to get out.

691
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,329
I'm going to the Colonies.

692
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,373
How? All those hyperlanes
are blocked.

693
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:32,380
That's a First Order Captain's
medallion.

694
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:34,674
I've never seen a real one.

695
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,634
Free passage
through any blockade.

696
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:38,511
Landing privileges, any vessel.

697
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,688
Wanna come with me?

698
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,447
I can't walk out on this war.

699
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,992
Not till it's over.

700
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:02,744
Maybe it is.

701
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:07,707
We sent out a call for help
at the Battle of Crait.

702
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:10,960
Nobody came.

703
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:13,129
Everyone's so afraid.

704
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,175
They've given up.

705
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:21,137
No, I don't believe
you believe that.

706
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,350
Hey.

707
00:52:26,185 --> 00:52:29,187
They win by making you think
you're alone.

708
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,148
Remember?

709
00:52:35,027 --> 00:52:36,861
There's more of us.

710
00:52:40,783 --> 00:52:42,158
Squeaky wheel.

711
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,577
I have a squeaky wheel.

712
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,334
Squeak eliminated.

713
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:53,336
Thank you.

714
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:54,796
Very kind.

715
00:53:01,887 --> 00:53:03,721
Something's not right
about all of this.

716
00:53:04,056 --> 00:53:05,348
Hmm?

717
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,724
I know where I've seen it.

718
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:08,810
The ship he was on. Ochi's ship.

719
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,186
What?

720
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:12,272
The day my parents left.

721
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:14,774
They were on that ship.

722
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:18,194
Are you sure?

723
00:53:18,279 --> 00:53:19,654
There's an incoming Destroyer.

724
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,948
We gotta go now.
Did we get it? Babu?

725
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:25,034
Yep. Droid is ready!

726
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,915
The Emperor's wayfinder

727
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,542
is in the Imperial vault.

728
00:53:32,710 --> 00:53:36,838
At delta 3-6, transient 9-3-6,
bearing 3-2...

729
00:53:37,006 --> 00:53:38,506
on a moon in the Endor system.

730
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,466
From the southern shore.

731
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,427
Only this blade tells.

732
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,054
Only this blade tells.

733
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,560
The Endor system.

734
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,228
Where the last war ended?

735
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:00,653
Rey!

736
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,408
Ren's Destroyer.

737
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,576
He's here?

738
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:12,123
Chewie?

739
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,001
What about him?

740
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,919
He's on Ren's ship.

741
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,254
He's alive.

742
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,214
What? How?

743
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,467
He's alive! He must've
been on a different transport.

744
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:23,551
We gotta go get him.

745
00:54:23,636 --> 00:54:25,011
Your friend’s on that sky trash?

746
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,220
I guess he is.

747
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,847
Might I introduce myself.

748
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:32,268
I am C-3PO, human-cyborg
relations. And you are?

749
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,622
Okay, that's gonna be a problem.

750
00:54:33,646 --> 00:54:36,064
Hello. I Babu Frik.

751
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:37,398
Why, hello!

752
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,825
Threepio, move your
metal ass. We're almost there.

753
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:49,869
How dare you!
We've only just met.

754
00:54:49,953 --> 00:54:51,204
Poe.

755
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,955
Might get you on a capital ship.

756
00:54:53,666 --> 00:54:54,707
Go help your friend.

757
00:54:56,335 --> 00:54:57,775
Zorii, I don't think
I can take this.

758
00:54:57,836 --> 00:54:59,379
I don't care what you think.

759
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:04,300
We have to go. Now.

760
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,511
- Come with us.
- Poe.

761
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:07,720
Can I kiss you?

762
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:08,930
Go.

763
00:55:14,603 --> 00:55:15,978
We've done nothing wrong!

764
00:55:16,063 --> 00:55:17,313
No sudden moves.

765
00:55:17,398 --> 00:55:18,940
What is that? Stop moving.

766
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:34,789
Medallion's good.

767
00:55:35,374 --> 00:55:37,166
Clear for entrance
into hangar 12.

768
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,334
Hang on, Chewie.

769
00:55:38,502 --> 00:55:39,502
We're coming.

770
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:42,338
Whoever this Chewie
person is, this is madness!

771
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:53,933
Credentials and manifest.

772
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,769
Close the blast doors.

773
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,816
- You three, stay there.
- Happily.

774
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:02,984
Which way?

775
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,402
Uh, no idea. Follow me.

776
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,592
Drop your weapons.

777
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,469
It's okay that we're here.

778
00:56:30,763 --> 00:56:32,096
It's okay that you're here.

779
00:56:32,181 --> 00:56:33,181
It's good.

780
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,409
You're relieved that we're here.

781
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:35,725
Thank goodness you're here.

782
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,809
Welcome, guys.

783
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:38,102
Does she do that to us?

784
00:56:38,187 --> 00:56:40,438
We're looking for a prisoner
and his belongings.

785
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:43,399
The cameras.

786
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,363
They said Chewie's this way.

787
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:00,875
Rey, come on.

788
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,127
The dagger is on this ship.
We need it.

789
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,087
Why?

790
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:08,800
A feeling. I'll meet you
back at the hangar.

791
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:09,967
Rey, you can't just...

792
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:12,220
Chewie.

793
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,852
Search the city again.

794
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,606
She's close.

795
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,070
Of course we came for you,
Chewie.

796
00:57:30,239 --> 00:57:31,999
Yeah, Rey's here.
She's gonna get the dagger.

797
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:40,373
Whose ship is this?

798
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,166
The ship's this way. Follow me.

799
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,960
Over here!

800
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:46,504
Wrong way!

801
00:57:47,381 --> 00:57:49,131
There's not really
a right way, is there?

802
00:57:51,343 --> 00:57:52,343
I found them.

803
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:54,887
Blast them!

804
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,184
Over here!

805
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:01,269
There they are. Get them!

806
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:18,744
- We close?
- Straight ahead.

807
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:19,829
Blast them!

808
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:24,000
Halt!

809
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:27,795
Poe!

810
00:58:31,258 --> 00:58:32,258
Are you okay?

811
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,927
Nope.

812
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,804
You there, hands up!

813
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:38,347
Drop your weapons now!

814
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:39,974
Put your weapons down!

815
00:58:40,142 --> 00:58:41,517
Drop them!

816
00:58:41,977 --> 00:58:43,519
Drop them now!

817
00:58:45,272 --> 00:58:46,272
Hey, fellas.

818
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,648
Shut up, scum.

819
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:30,107
No!

820
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:32,068
No!

821
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,527
No.

822
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,071
Rey.

823
00:59:37,366 --> 00:59:39,033
Wherever you are...

824
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:40,534
you are hard to find.

825
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,536
You're hard to get rid of.

826
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,873
I pushed you in the desert,

827
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:47,583
because I needed to see it.

828
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,378
I needed you to see it.

829
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,546
Who you are.

830
00:59:53,674 --> 00:59:55,758
I know the rest of your story.

831
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:58,886
Rey.

832
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,056
You're lying.

833
01:00:02,891 --> 01:00:04,350
I never lied to you.

834
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,519
Your parents were no one.

835
01:00:08,188 --> 01:00:09,438
They chose to be.

836
01:00:10,649 --> 01:00:11,816
To keep you safe.

837
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:12,900
Don't!

838
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:14,485
You remember more than you say.

839
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:16,278
I've been in your head.

840
01:00:16,363 --> 01:00:17,363
I don't want this!

841
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,531
Search your memories.

842
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:19,615
No!

843
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,954
Remember them.

844
01:00:25,497 --> 01:00:26,747
See them.

845
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:32,003
My love. Rey, be brave.

846
01:00:34,798 --> 01:00:36,048
You'll be safe here.

847
01:00:36,717 --> 01:00:38,009
I promise.

848
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,053
Come back!

849
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,138
No!

850
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:51,063
They sold you to protect you.

851
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,273
Stop talking.

852
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,400
Rey, I know
what happened to them.

853
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,452
Move it.

854
01:01:06,121 --> 01:01:07,121
Allegiant General,

855
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,266
the scavenger is not with them.

856
01:01:08,290 --> 01:01:10,666
Take them away. Terminate them.

857
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:17,757
Tell me where you are.

858
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:20,217
You don't know the whole story.

859
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:27,516
It was Palpatine
who had your parents taken.

860
01:01:28,769 --> 01:01:30,478
He was looking for you.

861
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:33,689
But they wouldn't say
where you were.

862
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,317
So he gave the order.

863
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:42,490
She isn't on Jakku. She's gone.

864
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,408
No!

865
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:46,869
No!

866
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,130
So that's where you are.

867
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,263
You know why the Emperor's
always wanted you dead.

868
01:02:06,348 --> 01:02:07,348
No.

869
01:02:08,058 --> 01:02:09,350
I'll come tell you.

870
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,442
She was in my quarters.
Lock down the ship.

871
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,572
Actually...

872
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,659
I'd like to do this myself.

873
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,706
What were you gonna
tell Rey before?

874
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:34,792
You still on that?

875
01:02:35,710 --> 01:02:37,030
Oh, I'm sorry,
is this a bad time?

876
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,107
Yeah.
Sort of is a bad time, Poe.

877
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,192
Well, 'cause later doesn't
really look like an option.

878
01:02:41,216 --> 01:02:42,318
If you're gonna let
something off your chest,

879
01:02:42,342 --> 01:02:43,742
maybe now's
not the worst time to...

880
01:02:47,889 --> 01:02:49,014
I'm the spy.

881
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,891
- What?
- You?

882
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:52,351
We don't have much time.

883
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:53,602
I knew it.

884
01:02:53,687 --> 01:02:54,687
No, you did not.

885
01:02:54,938 --> 01:02:56,230
What's your operating number?

886
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,108
That's not even a language.

887
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,614
Oh, dear! My first laser battle.

888
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,783
- Where are the others?
- They haven't come back.

889
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:15,374
Find them.

890
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,792
- Go.
- Yes.

891
01:03:21,089 --> 01:03:23,132
Friends ahead.

892
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:24,425
Oh, yes, there they are!

893
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,509
BB-8, come on!

894
01:03:25,594 --> 01:03:27,321
I'll shut down the
impeders. You've got seconds.

895
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,888
There she is.

896
01:03:28,972 --> 01:03:30,264
She's a survivor.

897
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,057
Wait. Wait.

898
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:34,101
- Blast me in the arm. Quick.
- What?

899
01:03:34,186 --> 01:03:35,186
Or they'll know.

900
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,606
No! Ahh!

901
01:03:39,399 --> 01:03:40,900
Why are you helping us?

902
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,861
I don't care if you win.

903
01:03:44,404 --> 01:03:46,780
I need Kylo Ren to lose.

904
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,600
Why did the Emperor come for me?

905
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:17,645
Why did he want to kill a child?

906
01:04:18,939 --> 01:04:19,939
Tell me.

907
01:04:20,315 --> 01:04:22,524
Because he saw
what you would become.

908
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:25,444
You don't just have power.

909
01:04:27,155 --> 01:04:29,114
You have his power.

910
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,407
You're his granddaughter.

911
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:35,412
You are a Palpatine.

912
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:45,839
My mother
was the daughter of Vader.

913
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,008
Your father
was the son of the Emperor.

914
01:04:49,219 --> 01:04:51,053
What Palpatine doesn't know

915
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:53,472
is we're a dyad
in the Force, Rey.

916
01:04:53,640 --> 01:04:55,516
Two that are one.

917
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:07,987
We'll kill him together
and take the throne.

918
01:05:16,830 --> 01:05:18,914
You know what you need to do.

919
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,333
You know.

920
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:31,719
I do.

921
01:05:39,227 --> 01:05:40,477
Hold her steady.

922
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,150
Finn, move fast!

923
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,736
Rey!

924
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,487
Come on!

925
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:56,285
Come on! I got you!

926
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:08,005
It was a coordinated
incursion, Allegiant General.

927
01:06:08,173 --> 01:06:09,340
They overpowered the guards

928
01:06:09,424 --> 01:06:11,091
and forced me
to take them to their ship.

929
01:06:11,718 --> 01:06:13,218
I see.

930
01:06:13,762 --> 01:06:15,137
Get me the Supreme Leader.

931
01:06:15,221 --> 01:06:16,221
Yes, sir.

932
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,436
Tell him we found our spy.

933
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:27,163
I don't know
why they're not following us,

934
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:28,192
but I don't trust it.

935
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:31,070
Landing gear's busted?
How busted?

936
01:06:33,073 --> 01:06:35,741
All that matters is
the wayfinder. Finding Exegol.

937
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:37,409
That's what we're doing.

938
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,041
He killed my mother.

939
01:06:45,543 --> 01:06:47,336
And my father.

940
01:06:49,631 --> 01:06:51,507
I'm going to find Palpatine...

941
01:06:52,967 --> 01:06:54,343
and destroy him.

942
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,137
Rey...

943
01:06:57,806 --> 01:06:59,223
that doesn't sound like you.

944
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,268
Rey, I know you...

945
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,187
People keep telling me
they know me.

946
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,524
I'm afraid no one does.

947
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:17,241
The Jedi apprentice still lives.

948
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:22,121
Perhaps you have betrayed me.

949
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:26,583
Do not make me
turn my fleet against you.

950
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,669
I know where she's going.

951
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,087
She'll never be a Jedi.

952
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,672
Make sure of it.

953
01:07:31,756 --> 01:07:33,006
Kill her.

954
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:16,884
What... What is that?

955
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,260
It's the Death Star.

956
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:21,096
A bad place from an old war.

957
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:24,349
It's gonna take us years to
find what we're looking for.

958
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:25,851
Oh, dear.

959
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:28,479
"Only this blade tells."

960
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,182
The wayfinder's there.

961
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:06,308
Heads up.

962
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:14,900
Rough landing.

963
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,402
- I've seen worse.
- I've seen better.

964
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:20,781
Are you Resistance?

965
01:09:20,949 --> 01:09:22,032
That depends.

966
01:09:22,116 --> 01:09:25,035
We picked up a transmission
from someone named Babu Frik.

967
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:28,080
Babu Frik? Oh,
he's one of my oldest friends.

968
01:09:28,706 --> 01:09:30,040
He said you'd come.

969
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,959
He said you were the last hope.

970
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:35,337
We have to get to that wreck.

971
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,089
There is something
inside there we need.

972
01:09:37,257 --> 01:09:38,757
I can take you there by water.

973
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,551
- Have you seen the water?
- Not now.

974
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:41,802
Too dangerous.

975
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:43,668
We can go first light tomorrow.

976
01:09:43,763 --> 01:09:45,973
We can't wait that long.
We don't have the time.

977
01:09:46,933 --> 01:09:48,141
Or the choice.

978
01:09:48,893 --> 01:09:50,102
Let's get that ship fixed.

979
01:09:50,645 --> 01:09:51,770
Do you have any spare parts?

980
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:52,938
Some.

981
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,439
- I'm Jannah.
- I'm Poe.

982
01:10:04,576 --> 01:10:05,576
Hello.

983
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:09,580
No, thank you. No, thank you.

984
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,291
What a dreadful situation.

985
01:10:12,458 --> 01:10:14,334
Is every day like this
for you people?

986
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:15,794
Madness.

987
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,963
Did we ever find
his volume control?

988
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:20,674
It's an O-6, but should work.

989
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,301
Thank you.

990
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,221
This is a First Order part.

991
01:10:26,389 --> 01:10:28,098
There's an old cruiser
on the west ridge.

992
01:10:28,182 --> 01:10:29,308
Stripped for parts.

993
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:31,977
The one we were assigned to.

994
01:10:32,395 --> 01:10:33,895
The one we escaped in.

995
01:10:34,522 --> 01:10:37,691
Okay, wait.
You were First Order?

996
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:38,900
Not by choice.

997
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,323
We were conscripted as kids.
All of us.

998
01:10:45,408 --> 01:10:48,160
I was TZ-1719. Stormtrooper.

999
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,494
FN-2187.

1000
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:51,580
You?

1001
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:52,956
I never knew there were more.

1002
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:56,084
Deserters? All of us here
were stormtroopers.

1003
01:10:56,586 --> 01:10:59,212
We mutinied at the battle
of Ansett Island.

1004
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,465
They told us
to fire on civilians.

1005
01:11:01,549 --> 01:11:02,591
We wouldn't do it.

1006
01:11:02,759 --> 01:11:04,468
We laid our weapons down.

1007
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,386
- All of you?
- The whole company.

1008
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,973
I don't even know
how it happened.

1009
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:13,852
It wasn't a decision, really,
it was like...

1010
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:14,978
An instinct.

1011
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:17,147
Feeling.

1012
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,149
A feeling.

1013
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:21,610
The Force.

1014
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,945
The Force brought me here.

1015
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:27,866
It brought me to Rey. And Poe.

1016
01:11:29,077 --> 01:11:31,203
You say that
like you're sure it's real.

1017
01:11:32,163 --> 01:11:33,372
It's real.

1018
01:11:34,082 --> 01:11:35,582
I wasn't sure then...

1019
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,044
but I am now.

1020
01:11:40,129 --> 01:11:41,505
What is it, buddy?

1021
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:45,592
What do you mean
you haven't seen her?

1022
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:02,359
She took the skimmer?

1023
01:12:37,562 --> 01:12:38,802
What the hell was she thinking?

1024
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,731
Poe, we gotta go after her.

1025
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:41,959
We'll get the Falcon fixed,

1026
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,043
and get out there
as fast as we can.

1027
01:12:43,067 --> 01:12:44,067
No, we're gonna lose her.

1028
01:12:44,152 --> 01:12:45,952
Look, she left us!
What do you wanna do? Swim?

1029
01:12:45,987 --> 01:12:46,987
She's not herself.

1030
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:48,530
You have no idea
what she's fighting.

1031
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:49,614
And you do?

1032
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,285
Yeah, I do.

1033
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,078
And so does Leia.

1034
01:12:56,247 --> 01:12:57,706
Well, I'm not Leia.

1035
01:12:58,291 --> 01:12:59,666
That's for damn sure.

1036
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:24,483
Finn.

1037
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:26,651
There's another skimmer.

1038
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,115
Don't be afraid of who you are.

1039
01:16:53,234 --> 01:16:54,943
Look at yourself.

1040
01:16:56,570 --> 01:16:58,632
You wanted to prove to my
mother that you were a Jedi...

1041
01:16:58,656 --> 01:17:00,240
but you've proven
something else.

1042
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,662
You can't go back to her now.

1043
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:08,957
Like I can't.

1044
01:17:11,252 --> 01:17:12,252
Give it to me.

1045
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,842
The dark side is in our nature.

1046
01:17:22,096 --> 01:17:23,304
Surrender to it.

1047
01:17:24,265 --> 01:17:25,348
Give it...

1048
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:26,975
to me.

1049
01:17:33,607 --> 01:17:36,985
The only way you're getting
to Exegol is with me.

1050
01:17:38,654 --> 01:17:39,654
No!

1051
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:15,982
Leia knows
what must be done, Artoo.

1052
01:18:16,942 --> 01:18:19,069
To reach her son now...

1053
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:22,614
will take all the strength
she has left.

1054
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:44,177
Rey!

1055
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,806
Rey!

1056
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:50,642
No!

1057
01:19:23,926 --> 01:19:25,969
No, we can't follow them!

1058
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,887
- I can't leave her!
- We can't!

1059
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,056
Rey!

1060
01:21:08,113 --> 01:21:09,864
Ben.

1061
01:21:40,145 --> 01:21:41,145
Leia.

1062
01:22:59,433 --> 01:23:01,642
I did want to take your hand.

1063
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,729
Ben's hand.

1064
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:50,066
Goodbye, dear princess.

1065
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:03,788
Poe, something's happened.

1066
01:24:03,956 --> 01:24:05,540
- Finn.
- This can't wait.

1067
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:07,333
We've gotta see the General.

1068
01:24:09,294 --> 01:24:10,294
She's gone.

1069
01:24:16,427 --> 01:24:17,718
Chewie...

1070
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:44,579
Hey, kid.

1071
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:06,893
I miss you, son.

1072
01:25:10,105 --> 01:25:11,355
Your son is dead.

1073
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,733
No.

1074
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:20,948
Kylo Ren is dead.

1075
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:24,785
My son is alive.

1076
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:31,834
You're just a memory.

1077
01:25:33,420 --> 01:25:35,087
Your memory.

1078
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,718
Come home.

1079
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:43,387
It's too late.

1080
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,725
She's gone.

1081
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,437
Your mother's gone.

1082
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:55,399
But what she stood for,
what she fought for...

1083
01:25:56,985 --> 01:25:58,361
that's not gone.

1084
01:26:05,035 --> 01:26:06,077
Ben.

1085
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,079
I know what I have to do...

1086
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:10,373
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1087
01:26:20,801 --> 01:26:22,468
You do.

1088
01:26:33,647 --> 01:26:34,855
Dad...

1089
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:42,071
I know.

1090
01:27:03,093 --> 01:27:06,762
The Princess of Alderaan
has disrupted my plan...

1091
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:10,975
but her foolish act
will be in vain.

1092
01:27:11,602 --> 01:27:15,354
Come to me on Exegol,
General Pryde.

1093
01:27:17,858 --> 01:27:20,234
As I served you in the old wars,

1094
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,694
I serve you now.

1095
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:26,115
Send a ship
to a world they know.

1096
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,618
Let it burn.

1097
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:31,495
The Final Order begins.

1098
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:35,750
She will come,
her friends will follow.

1099
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:37,501
Yes, my lord.

1100
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,723
Levels holding steady at 85%.

1101
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:53,059
Captain.

1102
01:27:54,311 --> 01:27:56,395
- Kijimi is in range.
- Fire.

1103
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:18,459
Kijimi? How?

1104
01:28:19,378 --> 01:28:21,253
A blast from a Star Destroyer.

1105
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,507
A ship from the new Sith fleet.

1106
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:26,008
Out of the Unknowns.

1107
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:28,552
The Emperor sent a ship
from Exegol.

1108
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,388
Does that mean every ship
in the fleet...

1109
01:28:30,472 --> 01:28:32,765
Has planet-killing weapons.
Of course they do.

1110
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:34,558
All of them.

1111
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,811
This is how he finishes it.

1112
01:28:36,978 --> 01:28:37,978
Listen.

1113
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,314
It's on every frequency.

1114
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,693
"The Resistance is dead.

1115
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,112
"The Sith flame will burn.

1116
01:28:47,155 --> 01:28:49,573
"All worlds, surrender or die.

1117
01:28:50,367 --> 01:28:52,368
"The Final Order begins."

1118
01:28:53,245 --> 01:28:54,704
Leia made you acting general.

1119
01:28:56,123 --> 01:28:57,498
What now?

1120
01:29:06,216 --> 01:29:08,217
I gotta tell you,
I don't really know...

1121
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:10,720
how to do this.

1122
01:29:12,305 --> 01:29:13,889
What you did...

1123
01:29:15,851 --> 01:29:17,351
I'm not ready.

1124
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:20,271
Neither were we.

1125
01:29:23,817 --> 01:29:25,818
Luke, Han, Leia, me...

1126
01:29:26,737 --> 01:29:27,903
Who's ever ready?

1127
01:29:28,613 --> 01:29:29,739
How'd you do it?

1128
01:29:31,616 --> 01:29:34,660
Defeat an empire
with almost nothing.

1129
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:36,454
We had each other.

1130
01:29:37,706 --> 01:29:39,331
That's how we won.

1131
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:44,670
Hey, don't touch that.
That's my friend's.

1132
01:29:44,755 --> 01:29:46,672
Sorry. She is gone?

1133
01:29:47,632 --> 01:29:48,758
Yeah, she's gone.

1134
01:29:48,925 --> 01:29:50,009
I don't know where.

1135
01:29:51,094 --> 01:29:52,094
I miss her.

1136
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:53,637
I miss her, too.

1137
01:29:56,641 --> 01:29:58,184
So, what's your name?

1138
01:29:58,351 --> 01:29:59,537
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1139
01:29:59,561 --> 01:30:00,913
I gotta talk to you
about something.

1140
01:30:00,937 --> 01:30:02,271
I can't do this alone.

1141
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:03,689
I need you in command with me.

1142
01:30:03,857 --> 01:30:06,025
This droid has...
Thank you. I appreciate that.

1143
01:30:06,109 --> 01:30:07,234
- General.
- General.

1144
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,445
This droid has a ton
of information about Exegol.

1145
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:10,929
- Wait, what? Cone-face?
- I am D-O.

1146
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,156
Sorry, D-O.

1147
01:30:12,324 --> 01:30:14,617
He was going to Exegol
with Ochi of Bestoon.

1148
01:30:14,701 --> 01:30:15,993
Why was Ochi going there?

1149
01:30:16,077 --> 01:30:17,077
To bring the little girl

1150
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:19,830
he was supposed to take
from Jakku to the Emperor.

1151
01:30:19,998 --> 01:30:21,957
He wanted her alive.

1152
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:15,594
A Jedi's weapon
deserves more respect.

1153
01:31:17,806 --> 01:31:19,515
Master Skywalker.

1154
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,142
What are you doing?

1155
01:31:23,103 --> 01:31:25,271
I saw myself on the dark throne.

1156
01:31:25,772 --> 01:31:27,356
I won't let it happen.

1157
01:31:27,524 --> 01:31:29,900
I'm never leaving this place.
I'm doing what you did.

1158
01:31:30,777 --> 01:31:32,486
I was wrong.

1159
01:31:33,864 --> 01:31:36,156
It was fear that kept me here.

1160
01:31:37,784 --> 01:31:39,410
What are you most afraid of?

1161
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,040
Myself.

1162
01:31:48,211 --> 01:31:49,962
Because you're a Palpatine.

1163
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,091
Leia knew it, too.

1164
01:31:55,260 --> 01:31:56,594
She didn't tell me.

1165
01:32:04,060 --> 01:32:05,603
She still trained me.

1166
01:32:06,646 --> 01:32:09,023
Because she saw your spirit.

1167
01:32:09,482 --> 01:32:11,025
Your heart.

1168
01:32:13,904 --> 01:32:14,945
Rey.

1169
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:18,574
Some things are stronger
than blood.

1170
01:32:19,701 --> 01:32:22,745
Confronting fear
is the destiny of a Jedi.

1171
01:32:23,246 --> 01:32:24,747
Your destiny.

1172
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:26,832
If you don't face Palpatine...

1173
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,335
it will mean the end
of the Jedi.

1174
01:32:30,879 --> 01:32:32,671
And the war will be lost.

1175
01:32:36,509 --> 01:32:39,219
There's something my sister
would want you to have.

1176
01:32:54,778 --> 01:32:56,278
Leia's saber.

1177
01:32:58,406 --> 01:33:00,449
It was the last night
of her training.

1178
01:33:18,051 --> 01:33:20,886
Leia told me that she had
sensed the death of her son

1179
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:23,347
at the end of her Jedi path.

1180
01:33:24,808 --> 01:33:27,851
She surrendered her saber
to me and said that one day...

1181
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:30,604
it would be picked up again...

1182
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:33,649
by someone who would
finish her journey.

1183
01:33:35,735 --> 01:33:39,071
A thousand generations
live in you now.

1184
01:33:40,156 --> 01:33:42,199
But this is your fight.

1185
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:45,911
You'll take both sabers
to Exegol.

1186
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:49,623
I can't get there.

1187
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:52,626
I don't have the wayfinder.
I destroyed Ren's ship.

1188
01:33:52,711 --> 01:33:55,129
You have everything you need.

1189
01:34:05,306 --> 01:34:06,724
Two were made.

1190
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:08,077
Oh, hello. I am C-3PO,
human-cyborg relations.

1191
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:10,370
And you are?

1192
01:35:10,455 --> 01:35:12,498
What?

1193
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,292
Well, I am quite certain
I would remember

1194
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:16,710
if I had a best friend.

1195
01:35:18,338 --> 01:35:20,089
You want to put what in my head?

1196
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:21,465
Under no circumstances...

1197
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,929
Memory restoration complete.

1198
01:35:27,847 --> 01:35:29,223
Artoo, have you heard?

1199
01:35:29,307 --> 01:35:32,101
I am going with Mistress Rey
on her very first mission.

1200
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,063
I already have?

1201
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:38,148
Picking up a signal? From whom?

1202
01:35:44,239 --> 01:35:46,573
All the information you need
for an air strike on Exegol.

1203
01:35:46,658 --> 01:35:47,858
Yeah, except how to get there.

1204
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,011
Are you seeing
these atmo readings?

1205
01:35:49,035 --> 01:35:50,035
It's a mess out there.

1206
01:35:50,120 --> 01:35:51,245
Magnetic crossfields.

1207
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,913
Gravity wells, solar winds.

1208
01:35:52,997 --> 01:35:54,266
How does a fleet
even take off from there?

1209
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:55,290
Terribly sorry.

1210
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:56,667
I'm afraid Artoo's memory bank

1211
01:35:56,751 --> 01:35:58,877
must be crossed
with his logic receptors.

1212
01:35:59,546 --> 01:36:02,422
He says he is receiving
a transmission from

1213
01:36:02,507 --> 01:36:03,674
Master Luke.

1214
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:06,051
That's an old craft ID.

1215
01:36:07,137 --> 01:36:08,929
That's Luke Skywalker's X-wing.

1216
01:36:09,097 --> 01:36:11,140
It's transmitting
course marker signals

1217
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:13,016
on its way
to the Unknown Regions.

1218
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:14,184
It's Rey.

1219
01:36:18,940 --> 01:36:20,440
She's going to Exegol.

1220
01:36:25,238 --> 01:36:26,613
She's showing us.

1221
01:36:26,781 --> 01:36:28,365
She's showing us
how to get there.

1222
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:31,952
Then we go together.

1223
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:39,626
Come on, buddy, we need you.

1224
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:43,297
As long as those
Star Destroyers are on Exegol

1225
01:36:43,381 --> 01:36:44,423
we can hit them.

1226
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:45,591
Hit them how?

1227
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:46,944
They can't activate
their shields

1228
01:36:46,968 --> 01:36:48,302
until they leave atmosphere.

1229
01:36:48,469 --> 01:36:49,595
Which isn't easy on Exegol.

1230
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:51,680
Ships that size
need help taking off.

1231
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:53,473
Nav can't tell
which way's up out there.

1232
01:36:53,641 --> 01:36:54,892
So, how do the ships take off?

1233
01:36:55,059 --> 01:36:56,727
They use a signal
from a navigation tower,

1234
01:36:56,811 --> 01:36:58,312
like this one.

1235
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:00,355
Except they won't.

1236
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:01,732
Air team's gonna find the tower,

1237
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:02,983
ground team's gonna blast it.

1238
01:37:03,067 --> 01:37:04,985
- Ground team?
- I have an idea for that.

1239
01:37:05,153 --> 01:37:07,047
Once the tower's down, the
fleet will be stuck in atmo...

1240
01:37:07,071 --> 01:37:08,071
for just minutes,

1241
01:37:08,156 --> 01:37:09,781
with no shields, and no way out.

1242
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,200
We think hitting the cannons

1243
01:37:11,284 --> 01:37:12,618
might ignite the main reactors.

1244
01:37:13,244 --> 01:37:14,703
That's our chance.

1245
01:37:14,871 --> 01:37:16,371
We need to pull
some Holdo manoeuvres.

1246
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:17,581
Do some real damage.

1247
01:37:17,665 --> 01:37:19,249
Come on.
That move is one in a million.

1248
01:37:19,334 --> 01:37:21,061
Fighters and freighters
can take out their cannons

1249
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,211
if there are enough of us.

1250
01:37:22,295 --> 01:37:23,879
There aren't enough of us!

1251
01:37:23,963 --> 01:37:26,131
He's right. We'd be
no more than bugs to them.

1252
01:37:26,216 --> 01:37:27,758
That's where Lando and Chewie
come in.

1253
01:37:28,301 --> 01:37:30,510
They'll take the Falcon
to the Core Systems.

1254
01:37:30,678 --> 01:37:32,846
Send out a call for help
for anybody listening.

1255
01:37:33,014 --> 01:37:34,264
We've got friends out there.

1256
01:37:34,432 --> 01:37:35,952
They'll come if they know
there's hope.

1257
01:37:37,518 --> 01:37:38,644
They will.

1258
01:37:39,729 --> 01:37:42,397
First Order wins by making us
think we're alone.

1259
01:37:43,191 --> 01:37:44,441
We're not alone.

1260
01:37:45,151 --> 01:37:47,611
Good people will fight
if we lead them.

1261
01:37:50,740 --> 01:37:52,574
Leia never gave up.

1262
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,868
And neither will we.

1263
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:57,913
We're gonna show them
we're not afraid.

1264
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,753
What our mothers
and fathers fought for...

1265
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,964
we will not let die.

1266
01:38:09,550 --> 01:38:10,717
Not today.

1267
01:38:12,178 --> 01:38:14,721
Today, we make our last stand.

1268
01:38:15,473 --> 01:38:17,015
For the galaxy.

1269
01:38:19,060 --> 01:38:20,269
For Leia.

1270
01:38:23,147 --> 01:38:24,731
For everyone we've lost.

1271
01:38:26,025 --> 01:38:27,734
They've taken enough of us.

1272
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:30,737
Now we take the war to them.

1273
01:38:57,515 --> 01:38:59,099
She's on approach.

1274
01:38:59,183 --> 01:39:01,643
All ships rise
to deployment altitude.

1275
01:39:41,893 --> 01:39:43,185
I know it's a rough ride...

1276
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,020
but stay locked on Rey's course.

1277
01:39:51,944 --> 01:39:53,487
Clear run frequency.

1278
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,572
Captain, we have
Resistance craft incoming.

1279
01:39:55,990 --> 01:39:57,074
Allegiant General...

1280
01:39:57,158 --> 01:39:58,408
Use ion cannons!

1281
01:40:03,915 --> 01:40:05,165
Look at that fleet.

1282
01:40:08,503 --> 01:40:09,503
Damn it!

1283
01:40:11,381 --> 01:40:12,547
Welcome to Exegol.

1284
01:40:16,177 --> 01:40:17,386
Watch your starboard, Wexley!

1285
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,680
- Whoa!
- Get to their altitude.

1286
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:22,768
They can't fire on us
without hitting each other.

1287
01:40:23,810 --> 01:40:24,935
Don't give up.

1288
01:40:25,353 --> 01:40:26,770
Help is coming.

1289
01:40:28,147 --> 01:40:29,231
There it is.

1290
01:40:29,399 --> 01:40:30,982
Poe, I see it.

1291
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:32,390
I've got a visual on the tower.

1292
01:41:21,367 --> 01:41:23,076
- Incoming TIEs!
- I see 'em!

1293
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:24,161
I got you, Finn.

1294
01:41:28,708 --> 01:41:30,468
- You ready back there?
- Never been readier.

1295
01:41:33,129 --> 01:41:34,796
They're targeting
the navigation tower...

1296
01:41:34,964 --> 01:41:36,089
so the fleet can't deploy.

1297
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:37,401
Then we won't use that tower.

1298
01:41:37,425 --> 01:41:39,384
Switch over the source
of navigation signal

1299
01:41:39,469 --> 01:41:40,635
to this ship.

1300
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:42,471
We'll guide
the fleet out ourselves.

1301
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,604
The navigation tower
has been deactivated.

1302
01:41:50,980 --> 01:41:52,772
- What?
- Those ships need that signal.

1303
01:41:52,899 --> 01:41:54,299
It's gotta be coming
from somewhere.

1304
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:56,026
They figured out
what we're doing.

1305
01:41:56,194 --> 01:41:58,069
Call off the ground invasion.

1306
01:41:58,154 --> 01:41:59,154
Wait.

1307
01:42:00,531 --> 01:42:02,616
The nav signal's coming
from that command ship.

1308
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,326
That's our drop zone.

1309
01:42:04,494 --> 01:42:05,660
How do you know?

1310
01:42:06,579 --> 01:42:07,579
A feeling.

1311
01:42:07,747 --> 01:42:09,414
You wanna launch
a ground invasion

1312
01:42:09,499 --> 01:42:10,540
on a Star Destroyer?

1313
01:42:10,708 --> 01:42:11,852
I don't want to,
but we can't take out

1314
01:42:11,876 --> 01:42:13,376
that ship's nav system
from the air.

1315
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:14,544
Give us cover.

1316
01:42:14,712 --> 01:42:16,315
We gotta keep that fleet there
till help arrives.

1317
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,589
- We hope.
- We hope.

1318
01:42:18,925 --> 01:42:20,175
You heard the General.

1319
01:42:20,343 --> 01:42:22,844
All Wings, cover that lander.

1320
01:42:27,683 --> 01:42:29,726
They've landed a troop carrier.

1321
01:42:29,894 --> 01:42:31,603
- Jam the speeders.
- I can't, sir.

1322
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:32,687
Why not?

1323
01:42:33,731 --> 01:42:34,898
They're not using speeders.

1324
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,155
Not bad for one lesson.

1325
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:44,699
You had a good teacher!

1326
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:53,250
Keep going!

1327
01:42:58,923 --> 01:43:00,423
You're doing great, buddy!

1328
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:02,050
The tower's up ahead.

1329
01:44:06,782 --> 01:44:09,618
Long have I waited.

1330
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:23,632
For my grandchild to come home.

1331
01:44:25,968 --> 01:44:28,678
I never wanted you dead.

1332
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,972
I wanted you here...

1333
01:44:31,515 --> 01:44:33,683
Empress Palpatine.

1334
01:44:36,228 --> 01:44:38,104
You will take the throne.

1335
01:44:40,816 --> 01:44:44,527
It is your birthright
to rule here.

1336
01:44:45,446 --> 01:44:49,074
It is in your blood. Our blood.

1337
01:44:50,951 --> 01:44:52,869
I haven't come
to lead the Sith...

1338
01:44:53,829 --> 01:44:55,372
I have come to end them.

1339
01:44:55,539 --> 01:44:57,248
As a Jedi?

1340
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:59,959
- Yes.
- No.

1341
01:45:00,169 --> 01:45:03,505
Your hatred, your anger.

1342
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,591
You want to kill me.

1343
01:45:07,968 --> 01:45:09,969
That is what I want.

1344
01:45:11,472 --> 01:45:13,014
Kill me...

1345
01:45:13,182 --> 01:45:16,351
and my spirit
will pass into you.

1346
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:20,021
As all the Sith live in me...

1347
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:22,982
you will be Empress...

1348
01:45:23,526 --> 01:45:25,568
we will be one.

1349
01:45:33,285 --> 01:45:35,286
Those thrusters are hot.
How are we doing?

1350
01:45:35,371 --> 01:45:37,664
We're gonna blow our way in,
and take out that nav tower.

1351
01:45:37,832 --> 01:45:39,165
All the hatches are blast-proof!

1352
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:40,625
All right, BB-8, you're up!

1353
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:42,085
I'll cover you.

1354
01:46:10,072 --> 01:46:11,656
This should do it.

1355
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:25,128
There it goes.

1356
01:46:26,589 --> 01:46:28,047
Nice one, Finn.

1357
01:46:28,132 --> 01:46:30,049
Nav signal's down,
but not for long.

1358
01:46:30,134 --> 01:46:31,426
We're offline, sir.

1359
01:46:32,636 --> 01:46:34,012
Reset the navigation signal!

1360
01:46:34,096 --> 01:46:35,138
Minutes away, sir.

1361
01:46:36,974 --> 01:46:39,100
- Finn, let's go!
- No, no, wait, listen.

1362
01:46:39,185 --> 01:46:40,245
The crown cannons have stopped.

1363
01:46:40,269 --> 01:46:41,455
They're resetting their systems.

1364
01:46:41,479 --> 01:46:44,105
- So?
- I gotta go do something.

1365
01:46:44,899 --> 01:46:46,357
I'm staying with you.

1366
01:46:48,611 --> 01:46:50,028
Still no Falcon or backup.

1367
01:46:51,655 --> 01:46:54,783
I don't know, Artoo.
Maybe nobody else is coming.

1368
01:46:54,867 --> 01:46:55,867
What do we do, General?

1369
01:46:57,161 --> 01:46:58,745
We gotta hit them ourselves.

1370
01:46:58,913 --> 01:47:00,056
What can we do
against these things?

1371
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:01,790
Just stay alive!

1372
01:47:04,084 --> 01:47:06,294
The time has come!

1373
01:47:16,222 --> 01:47:19,682
With your hatred,
you will take my life.

1374
01:47:19,892 --> 01:47:21,768
And you will ascend.

1375
01:47:23,395 --> 01:47:26,648
All you want is for me
to hate, but I won't.

1376
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:28,817
Not even you.

1377
01:47:29,944 --> 01:47:33,071
Weak. Like your parents.

1378
01:47:34,406 --> 01:47:36,074
My parents were strong.

1379
01:47:37,076 --> 01:47:38,993
They saved me from you.

1380
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:43,665
Your Master, Luke Skywalker,
was saved by his father.

1381
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:47,293
The only family you have here...

1382
01:47:47,837 --> 01:47:49,128
is me.

1383
01:48:10,526 --> 01:48:12,610
They don't have long.

1384
01:48:13,779 --> 01:48:16,531
No one is coming to help them.

1385
01:48:17,449 --> 01:48:21,160
And you are the one
who led them here.

1386
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:25,999
Strike me down. Take the throne.

1387
01:48:26,166 --> 01:48:28,209
Reign over the new Empire...

1388
01:48:28,377 --> 01:48:31,212
and the fleet will be yours.

1389
01:48:32,965 --> 01:48:36,801
Only you have the power
to save them.

1390
01:48:39,096 --> 01:48:43,558
Refuse, and your new family...

1391
01:48:44,602 --> 01:48:46,394
dies.

1392
01:49:04,538 --> 01:49:06,080
Good.

1393
01:49:17,343 --> 01:49:18,676
Ow.

1394
01:49:21,805 --> 01:49:24,515
Finn, where are you?
The lander's leaving.

1395
01:49:25,267 --> 01:49:27,644
- Finn!
- Go without us.

1396
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,479
We're taking
this entire ship down.

1397
01:49:31,315 --> 01:49:32,690
What? How?

1398
01:49:32,816 --> 01:49:34,275
We're gonna hit
the command deck.

1399
01:49:35,194 --> 01:49:37,904
Rose, please. Go.

1400
01:49:39,615 --> 01:49:40,615
- Rose!
- Rose!

1401
01:49:41,742 --> 01:49:43,284
I'll get the trigger!

1402
01:49:45,871 --> 01:49:48,247
The ritual begins.

1403
01:49:49,750 --> 01:49:51,542
She will strike me down...

1404
01:49:52,044 --> 01:49:55,296
and pledge herself as a Sith.

1405
01:50:15,818 --> 01:50:18,111
She will draw her weapon.

1406
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,199
She will come to me.

1407
01:50:36,964 --> 01:50:39,048
She will take her revenge.

1408
01:50:45,639 --> 01:50:48,391
And with a stroke
of her saber...

1409
01:50:48,559 --> 01:50:51,310
the Sith are reborn!

1410
01:50:52,604 --> 01:50:55,314
The Jedi are dead!

1411
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,795
Do it!

1412
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:20,089
Make the sacrifice!

1413
01:52:29,701 --> 01:52:33,037
Stand together, die together.

1414
01:52:42,756 --> 01:52:45,675
The lifeforce of your bond...

1415
01:52:48,220 --> 01:52:51,597
a dyad in the Force.

1416
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:54,892
A power like life itself.

1417
01:52:55,853 --> 01:52:59,355
Unseen for generations.

1418
01:52:59,523 --> 01:53:01,149
And now...

1419
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:07,780
the power of two restores
the one, true Emperor.

1420
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:30,446
Snap, they're on your tail.

1421
01:53:30,470 --> 01:53:31,470
Yeah, I see 'em!

1422
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:33,514
No, no, no, Snap, Snap!

1423
01:53:33,599 --> 01:53:34,974
No!

1424
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,645
Alpha Three is down.

1425
01:53:40,063 --> 01:53:42,315
- They're on my tail!
- I can't get...

1426
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:43,983
They're everywhere!

1427
01:53:45,777 --> 01:53:47,361
Delta leader's hit!

1428
01:53:48,280 --> 01:53:49,322
Losing altitude!

1429
01:53:49,406 --> 01:53:50,823
General, what's our next move?

1430
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:53,367
Poe, what now?

1431
01:53:53,535 --> 01:53:54,785
My friends...

1432
01:53:57,289 --> 01:53:58,497
I'm sorry.

1433
01:53:59,833 --> 01:54:01,334
I thought we had a shot.

1434
01:54:03,212 --> 01:54:04,962
But there's just
too many of them.

1435
01:54:06,173 --> 01:54:07,965
But there are more of us, Poe.

1436
01:54:08,717 --> 01:54:10,509
There are more of us.

1437
01:54:21,563 --> 01:54:22,980
Look at this.

1438
01:54:23,607 --> 01:54:25,149
Look at this.

1439
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:36,786
Lando, you did it. You did it!

1440
01:54:39,248 --> 01:54:40,665
Hit those underbelly cannons.

1441
01:54:40,749 --> 01:54:43,000
Every one we knock out
is a world saved.

1442
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:47,380
Nice flying, Lando.

1443
01:54:57,849 --> 01:54:59,517
We have a ship down.
We lost a Destroyer.

1444
01:54:59,643 --> 01:55:00,977
Systems not responding.

1445
01:55:01,061 --> 01:55:02,288
Where did they get
all these fighter craft?

1446
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:03,312
They have no navy.

1447
01:55:03,397 --> 01:55:06,399
It's not a navy, sir,
it's just people.

1448
01:55:17,411 --> 01:55:19,203
So long, sky trash!

1449
01:55:19,371 --> 01:55:20,454
Who's that flyer?

1450
01:55:20,622 --> 01:55:22,707
Take a guess, spice runner.

1451
01:55:24,793 --> 01:55:27,628
Ha! Zorii! You made it!

1452
01:55:40,392 --> 01:55:43,519
Look what you have made.

1453
01:56:02,831 --> 01:56:05,833
As once I fell...

1454
01:56:05,917 --> 01:56:10,046
so falls the last Skywalker.

1455
01:56:17,471 --> 01:56:20,848
Do not fear
that feeble attack...

1456
01:56:21,016 --> 01:56:22,600
my faithful.

1457
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:27,104
Nothing will stop
the return of the Sith!

1458
01:56:38,992 --> 01:56:40,785
Artoo, my systems are failing.

1459
01:56:41,953 --> 01:56:43,120
Does anyone copy?

1460
01:57:24,621 --> 01:57:26,205
Be with me.

1461
01:57:31,044 --> 01:57:32,795
Be with me.

1462
01:57:38,427 --> 01:57:40,177
Be with me.

1463
01:57:43,765 --> 01:57:46,684
These are your final steps, Rey.

1464
01:57:46,852 --> 01:57:49,478
Rise and take them.

1465
01:57:49,938 --> 01:57:51,564
- Rey.
- Rey.

1466
01:57:51,648 --> 01:57:52,648
Rey.

1467
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:54,900
Bring back
the balance, Rey, as I did.

1468
01:57:55,068 --> 01:57:57,403
In the night,
find the light, Rey.

1469
01:57:57,571 --> 01:57:59,113
You're not alone, Rey.

1470
01:57:59,281 --> 01:58:01,365
Alone never have you been.

1471
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:04,577
Every Jedi
who ever lived lives in you.

1472
01:58:04,703 --> 01:58:05,953
The Force surrounds you, Rey.

1473
01:58:06,037 --> 01:58:07,037
Let it guide you.

1474
01:58:07,122 --> 01:58:08,122
As it guided us.

1475
01:58:08,206 --> 01:58:10,416
Feel the Force
flowing through you, Rey.

1476
01:58:10,584 --> 01:58:11,625
Let it lift you.

1477
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:13,002
Rise, Rey.

1478
01:58:13,712 --> 01:58:15,254
We stand behind you, Rey.

1479
01:58:15,338 --> 01:58:16,338
Rey.

1480
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,716
Rise in the Force.

1481
01:58:18,800 --> 01:58:21,760
In the heart of a Jedi
lies her strength.

1482
01:58:22,721 --> 01:58:24,722
- Rise.
- Rise.

1483
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:30,269
Rey, the Force
will be with you, always.

1484
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:51,916
Let your death
be the final word...

1485
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:54,877
in the story of rebellion.

1486
01:59:06,056 --> 01:59:08,098
I'm back on!
This is our last chance.

1487
01:59:08,183 --> 01:59:10,100
We gotta hit those cannons now!

1488
01:59:14,606 --> 01:59:17,441
You are nothing!

1489
01:59:17,609 --> 01:59:21,529
A scavenger girl is no match
for the power in me.

1490
01:59:24,908 --> 01:59:28,077
I am all the Sith!

1491
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:33,082
And I...

1492
01:59:38,505 --> 01:59:40,297
I'm all the Jedi.

1493
02:00:30,849 --> 02:00:32,349
Poe, the command ship!

1494
02:00:33,977 --> 02:00:35,519
Their fleet is stuck here!

1495
02:00:35,645 --> 02:00:36,854
They're toast! Come on!

1496
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:42,276
Finn, you seeing this?

1497
02:00:42,360 --> 02:00:43,520
Finn didn't board the lander.

1498
02:00:44,195 --> 02:00:45,988
They're still
on that command ship?

1499
02:00:56,708 --> 02:00:59,001
I see them.
I'm going to get them.

1500
02:00:59,753 --> 02:01:01,086
General, you won't make it.

1501
02:01:01,212 --> 02:01:02,504
Trust me, I'm fast!

1502
02:01:02,631 --> 02:01:04,465
Not as fast as this ship.

1503
02:01:07,385 --> 02:01:09,511
Hold on, Chewie!

1504
02:01:19,147 --> 02:01:20,731
Finn!

1505
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:58,102
No, Rey.

1506
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,538
Ben.

1507
02:05:44,787 --> 02:05:46,288
There, look!

1508
02:05:47,206 --> 02:05:48,540
Red Five is in the air.

1509
02:05:48,625 --> 02:05:49,917
Rey's alive.

1510
02:05:51,711 --> 02:05:52,753
I see her.

1511
02:05:52,921 --> 02:05:55,380
People are rising up
all over the galaxy.

1512
02:05:56,215 --> 02:05:59,176
Poe. We did it.

1513
02:05:59,302 --> 02:06:00,344
We did it.

1514
02:06:56,985 --> 02:06:58,652
Happy.

1515
02:07:02,824 --> 02:07:03,949
Chewie!

1516
02:07:34,731 --> 02:07:35,772
Hi!

1517
02:07:35,940 --> 02:07:37,024
Good job!

1518
02:07:41,904 --> 02:07:43,113
Chewie.

1519
02:07:45,700 --> 02:07:47,576
This is for you.

1520
02:08:05,928 --> 02:08:07,679
Did you hear that?

1521
02:08:34,332 --> 02:08:36,041
Where are you from, General?

1522
02:08:36,209 --> 02:08:38,001
The Gold system.

1523
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:44,007
Well, what about you, kid?

1524
02:08:44,801 --> 02:08:45,884
Oh.

1525
02:08:46,344 --> 02:08:47,594
I don't know.

1526
02:08:49,806 --> 02:08:51,473
Well, let's find out.

1527
02:11:31,634 --> 02:11:33,927
There's been no one for so long.

1528
02:11:34,804 --> 02:11:36,304
Who are you?

1529
02:11:37,932 --> 02:11:39,349
I'm Rey.

1530
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:41,685
Rey who?

1531
02:12:06,502 --> 02:12:07,877
Rey Skywalker.
