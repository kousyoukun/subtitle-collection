00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:44,154
#I see trees of green #

2
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:47,566
#Red roses too #

3
00:00:47,602 --> 00:00:50,901
#I see them bloom #

4
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:53,305
#For me and you #

5
00:00:53,341 --> 00:00:58,574
#And I think to myself #

6
00:00:58,613 --> 00:01:02,379
#What a wonderful world #

7
00:01:06,554 --> 00:01:10,820
#I see skies of blue #

8
00:01:10,859 --> 00:01:13,521
#And clouds of white #

9
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:17,794
#The bright blessed day #

10
00:01:17,832 --> 00:01:20,357
#The dark sacred night #

11
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:25,465
#And I think to myself #

12
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:29,944
#What a wonderful world #

13
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,310
#Yes #

14
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:38,217
#I think to myself #

15
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,655
#What a wonderful #

16
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,952
Yes, dude!

17
00:01:46,995 --> 00:01:49,691
What the fuck? What the fuck?
What are you doing?

18
00:01:49,731 --> 00:01:52,564
I'm taking the most incredible dump
of all time, man.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,227
You couldn't wait
till I got out of the shower?

20
00:01:54,269 --> 00:01:58,171
May I remind you that
we both just ate 30 burgers...

21
00:01:58,206 --> 00:02:00,401
and four large orders of fries?

22
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,744
Don't worry, in a little bit,
I'm sure it'll hit you too.

23
00:02:04,779 --> 00:02:08,010
It may be. But I'm gonna wait
till you get out of the shower.

24
00:02:08,049 --> 00:02:11,109
Well, don't wait too long. We've got
to leave for the airport in an hour.

25
00:02:11,152 --> 00:02:12,141
Ooh, that burns.

26
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:15,213
- An hour?
- Hey, and, Roldy?

27
00:02:15,957 --> 00:02:17,652
Yeah?

28
00:02:17,692 --> 00:02:19,421
Nice pubes.

29
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,020
Asshole, get out of here right now.

30
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:25,760
- Wipe and leave. Wipe and leave now!
- Dude, this thing is huge!

31
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,859
I think it still has cheese on it.

32
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,885
dude. Oh, my Go...
I just realized something.

33
00:03:57,926 --> 00:03:58,915
What?

34
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,724
Maria's gonna think I'm a stalker, man.
I'm following her to Amsterdam.

35
00:04:01,763 --> 00:04:05,028
Dude, relax. I have a med school
interview in ten minutes.

36
00:04:05,066 --> 00:04:06,829
You don't see me freaking out.

37
00:04:06,868 --> 00:04:09,098
Don't worry, man,
she'll be psyched to see you.

38
00:04:09,137 --> 00:04:10,764
Oh, psyched? You think
she's gonna be psyched?

39
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,932
Totes, dude. Why wouldn't she be?

40
00:04:13,007 --> 00:04:14,309
So how does this work?

41
00:04:14,309 --> 00:04:17,642
We just... we show up in Amsterdam
and we start calling hotels...

42
00:04:17,679 --> 00:04:19,579
and ask if they have
a Maria staying there?

43
00:04:19,614 --> 00:04:22,105
- I don't even know her last name.
- Dude, it's totally cool.

44
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:23,981
We're definitely gonna find her.

45
00:04:24,018 --> 00:04:25,815
Amsterdam is a very small place.
It's not gonna be...

46
00:04:25,854 --> 00:04:28,618
Sir, I need you to step aside, please.
Let me search you.

47
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:30,453
- Did I beep?
- No, you didn't beep.

48
00:04:30,492 --> 00:04:31,584
Just a random security check.

49
00:04:31,626 --> 00:04:34,094
If you could just step aside, please?
Just over here.

50
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:36,619
- Random, huh?
- Yeah.

51
00:04:36,664 --> 00:04:39,292
So this has nothing to do
with my ethnicity?

52
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:40,961
Kumar, just do what the guy says.

53
00:04:41,002 --> 00:04:43,163
Sir, it's our job as airport security...

54
00:04:43,204 --> 00:04:46,105
to search for all possible weapons
or illegal drugs.

55
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:49,041
So just because of the color of my skin,
you assume that I have drugs on me?

56
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:50,669
- No, he's...
- What are you, a racist?

57
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:53,840
Racist? Dude, I'm black.

58
00:04:53,882 --> 00:04:56,350
He's black. He's not a racist.

59
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,046
Please, dude, you're barely even brown.

60
00:04:59,087 --> 00:05:00,952
No, he didn't mean that.

61
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:02,718
Compared to me,
you look like Matthew Perry.

62
00:05:02,757 --> 00:05:04,725
Hey, who you calling Matthew Perry, bitch?

63
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:07,728
I'm calling you Matthew Perry,
you Matthew Perry-looking bitch!

64
00:05:07,762 --> 00:05:09,753
No, there's nobody here
who is Matthew Perry. No one!

65
00:05:09,797 --> 00:05:11,321
What is going on here?

66
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:14,858
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks
that I have illegal narcotics on me...

67
00:05:14,903 --> 00:05:16,302
because I'm a minority.

68
00:05:16,337 --> 00:05:18,237
This is textbook racial profiling...

69
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,264
and I'd be more than happy
to call the ACLU or the government...

70
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:22,776
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

71
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,677
- You can move along.
- I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt Perry.

72
00:05:27,115 --> 00:05:28,377
Hey, what are you doing?

73
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,384
What do you mean, what am I doing?
He called me Matthew Perry.

74
00:05:30,418 --> 00:05:31,715
Well, you look like Matthew Perry.

75
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:33,584
- He's white!
- So what?

76
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,953
Why does everything have to become
a huge argument with you, man?

77
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,423
'Cause this is America, dude...

78
00:05:37,458 --> 00:05:40,188
and as long as I have my freedom
of speech, no one's gonna shut me up.

79
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:41,752
Kumar?

80
00:05:44,766 --> 00:05:45,926
Roldy?

81
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:49,027
- Vanessa.
- Oh, my God!

82
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,437
- Good to see you.
- So good to see you. L...

83
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:54,600
- Hi. Hey.
- Hey.

84
00:05:54,642 --> 00:05:55,734
Hey.

85
00:05:55,777 --> 00:05:59,213
God, it's been forever.
What are you guys doing?

86
00:05:59,247 --> 00:06:01,715
We're actually on our way
to Amsterdam.

87
00:06:01,749 --> 00:06:02,943
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

88
00:06:02,984 --> 00:06:04,713
Well, you guys haven't changed.

89
00:06:04,752 --> 00:06:07,812
You have. You look amazing.
Your hair is diff...

90
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:10,790
- doesn't she look amazing?
- Yeah.

91
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:12,918
Yeah, you look great.
You look awesome. Sorry.

92
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:15,953
What am I even saying?
You look different and...

93
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:19,592
- Kumar Patel, you're flustered.
- Little bit.

94
00:06:21,436 --> 00:06:25,930
So, what's up with you? You still dating
the Abercrombie-wearing douchebag?

95
00:06:25,974 --> 00:06:28,101
Actually, it's Brooks Brothers.

96
00:06:28,142 --> 00:06:31,111
Colton! How are you, buddy?

97
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,737
- Good to see ya.
- Good to see you.

98
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:34,543
And we're not dating anymore.

99
00:06:34,582 --> 00:06:36,948
No. We... are getting married.

100
00:06:37,885 --> 00:06:39,819
Congratulations, you guys.

101
00:06:39,854 --> 00:06:42,379
- You're fucking getting married?
- Yeah.

102
00:06:42,423 --> 00:06:45,358
- When?
- Next week.

103
00:06:46,094 --> 00:06:48,062
It's going to be a perfect day.

104
00:06:48,096 --> 00:06:50,530
I mean, that's assuming we get
those Stargazer lilies for the bouquets.

105
00:06:50,565 --> 00:06:52,556
This florist has been
a complete nightmare.

106
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,500
Fucking assholes.

107
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:57,299
Colton's practically planning
the whole wedding all by himself.

108
00:06:57,338 --> 00:07:00,603
So, Rold, Brewster Keegan letting you
off the leash for a little vay-cay?

109
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,668
I own that place now, Colton.

110
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:05,508
Thank you so much for the hook-up.

111
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:08,913
Hey, I ran into Todd,
at Whitaker's, of course.

112
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,418
He told me you got a job
working for the government.

113
00:07:11,452 --> 00:07:13,886
Yeah! Yeah, President Bush and my dad
were in the same fraternity.

114
00:07:13,921 --> 00:07:15,252
- Oh, that's right.
- Oh, Jesus.

115
00:07:15,289 --> 00:07:17,280
Yeah, yeah, when he gave my dad that
appointment at the defense department...

116
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:19,418
- I became his right-hand man.
- Douche.

117
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,620
The President's supposed to be
at our wedding...

118
00:07:20,662 --> 00:07:22,755
- but you know how busy he is.
- Yeah.

119
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:24,594
Sounds like an incredible job, man.

120
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:27,100
Hey, you really got
some major connections to the top.

121
00:07:27,135 --> 00:07:29,603
If you ever need anything, I'm your man.

122
00:07:29,637 --> 00:07:31,867
- Thank you so much, buddy.
- Anytime.

123
00:07:31,906 --> 00:07:33,635
This guy's the best.

124
00:07:33,675 --> 00:07:36,235
- So, sweetheart, we should get going.
- Yes.

125
00:07:36,277 --> 00:07:38,939
- Good to see you guys again.
- Congratulations again.

126
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,346
- Thank you. Take care, thank you.
- It's so nice.

127
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:42,872
- Bye.
- Bye.

128
00:07:56,998 --> 00:07:58,465
Dude, I can't believe
they're getting married.

129
00:07:58,499 --> 00:08:00,490
We've only been broken up two years.

130
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:03,034
Plus that dude has date-rape face.

131
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,164
I don't even know what that is.

132
00:08:05,206 --> 00:08:07,697
One who possesses
the face of a date rapist.

133
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:11,041
Right. Listen...

134
00:08:11,079 --> 00:08:13,547
I'm sorry, bro.

135
00:08:13,581 --> 00:08:16,209
But we are going to Amsterdam.
Come on.

136
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:19,413
This is true. This is true, Roldy.

137
00:08:25,226 --> 00:08:28,559
- Man, this is so not like me.
- Yeah.

138
00:08:28,596 --> 00:08:32,088
It's like I'm a whole new Harold.
Better, faster, stronger.

139
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:33,794
Nice.

140
00:08:33,835 --> 00:08:34,893
Man, I've never used a sick day before.

141
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:38,133
I'm taking a whole week off
from work here, man.

142
00:08:38,172 --> 00:08:41,938
And in less than eight hours,
we're gonna be in Amsterdam.

143
00:08:41,976 --> 00:08:44,467
- This is nuts. This is nuts.
- I know, dude.

144
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:46,503
It's gonna be exactly like Euro Tr/p,
only it's not gonna suck.

145
00:08:46,547 --> 00:08:50,108
- It's gonna be awesome.
- It's not not gonna be awesome.

146
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,857
Dude. Dude, this chick's giving me
such a boner, it's awesome.

147
00:09:32,894 --> 00:09:34,828
Thank you. You ruined the moment.

148
00:09:36,898 --> 00:09:38,365
She's all yours, buddy.

149
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,299
- You wanna pause it?
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

150
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,029
No, that's...

151
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:43,730
Enjoy.

152
00:09:54,649 --> 00:09:56,378
Just a minute.

153
00:09:56,417 --> 00:09:57,884
Fuc...

154
00:09:57,919 --> 00:09:59,511
Hey, hey.

155
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:01,548
Let me in.

156
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:05,853
What are you doing?
I'm taking a piss, asshole!

157
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:07,019
- Yeah.
- Yo!

158
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:09,529
I'm not joining
the mile-high club with you.

159
00:10:09,564 --> 00:10:11,555
What about the really high club?

160
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:14,895
- Are you retarded?
- No.

161
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:16,836
You brought weed
on the fucking airplane?

162
00:10:16,871 --> 00:10:19,101
- Yep.
- What the fuck?

163
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,108
Wait a second. You were giving
that security guard shit.

164
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,133
Yeah. How else was I
supposed to get past him?

165
00:10:23,177 --> 00:10:25,941
By not bringing drugs on an airplane?

166
00:10:26,948 --> 00:10:29,849
- Look... What are you doing? What is this?
- You'll see.

167
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:43,591
Harold Lee, I would like to introduce you
to an invention of mine.

168
00:10:43,631 --> 00:10:45,758
Meet the smokeless bong.

169
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,701
- You made this?
- You know, I did.

170
00:10:48,736 --> 00:10:49,862
When you were slaving away at work...

171
00:10:49,904 --> 00:10:52,532
I was actually being
a productive member of society.

172
00:10:52,573 --> 00:10:56,737
- Yeah, that's really productive.
- Let me show you how it works.

173
00:10:56,777 --> 00:10:59,337
So you take a little weed...

174
00:11:00,348 --> 00:11:03,283
put it in the bowl right here and
light it just like a normal bong, OK?

175
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:05,148
Now here's the truly genius part.

176
00:11:05,186 --> 00:11:10,783
Inside this mechanism, I have
actually made a little tiny, tiny fan...

177
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:13,555
and some disinfectant powder, OK,
it works sort of like a deodorizer...

178
00:11:13,594 --> 00:11:16,392
so that anything it expunges
smells like Lysol.

179
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,057
- Put it away.
- No, dude.

180
00:11:18,099 --> 00:11:20,090
Can you not wait
till we get to Amsterdam?

181
00:11:20,134 --> 00:11:22,796
It's the weed capital of the world!

182
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,864
- No.
- Put the bong away!

183
00:11:25,907 --> 00:11:27,738
- Take the inaugural hit, dude.
- No!

184
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:28,867
Come on, man.

185
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:32,107
- Then I'm gonna do it.
- Put it away. Put the frickin' bong away.

186
00:11:36,017 --> 00:11:38,952
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Turb...

187
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:48,260
Terrorist!

188
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:51,293
Roldy?

189
00:11:51,332 --> 00:11:53,664
- What the fuck is that thing in his hands?
- No, ma'am, not a terrorist.

190
00:11:53,701 --> 00:11:56,568
- He's just an idiot.
- This is just a bong.

191
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:59,072
He said he got a bomb!

192
00:12:00,975 --> 00:12:04,001
No, people,
it's a water pipe for tobacco.

193
00:12:04,045 --> 00:12:06,411
No, no, no, it's not a bomb. It's just a bong.

194
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:17,447
Poison gas!

195
00:12:22,797 --> 00:12:25,857
It's marijuana! Marijuana!

196
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,097
You picked the wrong plane,
you terrorist fuck!

197
00:12:29,136 --> 00:12:31,104
Hey!
Hey, what are you doing?

198
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,541
There are three air marshals
on board. Three!

199
00:12:35,576 --> 00:12:39,171
We are not terrorists!
Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb.

200
00:12:39,213 --> 00:12:41,010
Shut up!

201
00:12:42,016 --> 00:12:43,210
I got this one!

202
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:44,581
- Roldy?
- Please don't!

203
00:12:44,618 --> 00:12:47,553
I am in a great amount of pain!

204
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:51,786
Everybody relax. Just calm down.
Everything is under control.

205
00:12:51,826 --> 00:12:56,092
Tell 'em to turn the plane around. These
two assholes are goin' back to the U.S.

206
00:13:20,021 --> 00:13:23,616
Secretary Fox. Glad you could make it.

207
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:26,649
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack
of this magnitude?

208
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:28,924
Not a fuckin' chance.

209
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:35,059
Who are these people?

210
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:38,401
Representatives
of the different intelligence agencies.

211
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,930
I assume
Secretary Whitmore's coming?

212
00:13:40,975 --> 00:13:45,674
Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip
in Glacier Bay.

213
00:13:45,713 --> 00:13:47,305
I'm in charge while he's gone.

214
00:13:47,348 --> 00:13:49,782
Well, shouldn't he be alerted?

215
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:55,119
Isn't this issue of more importance
than an ice fishing trip?

216
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,386
Who are you again?

217
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:04,625
Dr. John Beecher,
Vice Chairman of the NSA.

218
00:14:04,665 --> 00:14:08,032
Yeah, well, listen, dr... dipshit.

219
00:14:08,836 --> 00:14:11,396
You've obviously
never been ice fishing before.

220
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:17,038
- No, I haven't.
- Yeah, well, it's fucking exhilarating.

221
00:14:17,078 --> 00:14:20,775
The last thing anyone would want
while fishing for pike is to be interrupted.

222
00:14:20,815 --> 00:14:22,612
Now back off...

223
00:14:23,617 --> 00:14:25,983
and let me do my job.

224
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,390
What's up with the guy
with the weird eyes?

225
00:14:40,434 --> 00:14:43,028
He handicapped or something?

226
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:45,061
We believe he's of Korean descent.

227
00:14:48,676 --> 00:14:50,541
My God.

228
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,671
North Korea and al-Qaeda
workin' together.

229
00:14:55,716 --> 00:14:57,479
This is bigger than I thought.

230
00:14:58,052 --> 00:15:00,020
You couldn't wait?

231
00:15:00,054 --> 00:15:02,750
You couldn't fucking wait?

232
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,452
We were about to have
all the legal weed we wanted.

233
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:08,758
You know, in Amsterdam,
where we were going!

234
00:15:26,881 --> 00:15:28,542
Thought you could
get away with this, huh?

235
00:15:32,553 --> 00:15:39,584
You thought that after 9/11
our national security was a joke, huh?

236
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:42,053
Well...

237
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,159
guess what?

238
00:15:47,134 --> 00:15:48,396
What?

239
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,831
We knew you fuckers would be back.

240
00:15:52,873 --> 00:15:54,033
- Holy shit!
- But we're Americans, man.

241
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:56,838
- We love America. We love America!
- Very much.

242
00:15:56,877 --> 00:15:58,606
That's a convenient thing to say...

243
00:15:58,646 --> 00:16:01,615
after you try and blow up a plane
filled with Americans!

244
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:02,877
- No.
- No, we didn't do...

245
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:05,442
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.

246
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:07,317
My idiot friend here
brought marijuana...

247
00:16:07,354 --> 00:16:08,844
- on the plane.
- Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

248
00:16:08,889 --> 00:16:12,950
Zip it, Hello Kitty. OK? I know
your operation's funded through drugs.

249
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:14,858
No. This is typical
government bullshit, sir. L...

250
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,658
- Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. Shut up!
- L...

251
00:16:16,697 --> 00:16:20,565
- No, I'm trying to explain it! Harold!
- Shut up, shut up, shut up! Shut up!

252
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:25,031
Do we have the right
to make a phone call?

253
00:16:26,207 --> 00:16:27,834
Yeah. Yeah!

254
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:31,242
I'm sorry. You want rights now.

255
00:16:31,278 --> 00:16:33,940
You want freedoms right now.

256
00:16:33,981 --> 00:16:35,846
Is it time? Is it freedom o'clock?

257
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:41,379
- Guess what.
- What?

258
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:47,353
Where you guys are going,
they have never even heard of rights.

259
00:16:48,562 --> 00:16:50,530
Well, where are we going?

260
00:16:57,805 --> 00:17:01,639
We're innocent men!
We're innocent men!

261
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,477
I'm an innocent man.

262
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:07,479
I donate blood.

263
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:10,415
And toys for tots.

264
00:17:14,188 --> 00:17:16,816
And now I'm in Guantanamo Bay.

265
00:17:16,857 --> 00:17:18,950
See why I'm against paying taxes?

266
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:20,756
Hey! Hey.

267
00:17:21,595 --> 00:17:22,926
Fuck you!

268
00:17:22,963 --> 00:17:24,931
Dude, calm down, OK?

269
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:28,628
Look on the bright side.
There's a sink. There's a toilet.

270
00:17:28,669 --> 00:17:30,637
The pillow actually
looks pretty comfortable.

271
00:17:33,507 --> 00:17:36,169
OK. You don't speak to me, ever.

272
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,472
- Ever.
- OK.

273
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,741
- No! Shut up!
- OK.

274
00:17:42,316 --> 00:17:43,647
So what are you guys in here for?

275
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:50,986
For giving the United States
a taste of their own medicine.

276
00:17:51,959 --> 00:17:56,089
- You guys are real terrorists?
- Some call us terrorists.

277
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:58,462
Others call us heroes.

278
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:02,094
Screw that. You think you guys
are heroes for killing innocent people?

279
00:18:02,136 --> 00:18:04,263
It's 'cause of assholes like you
that we're even in this fucking place...

280
00:18:04,305 --> 00:18:05,704
you fucking cowards!

281
00:18:05,739 --> 00:18:08,572
Well, maybe if the people in your country
stopped eating donuts...

282
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:11,407
and started realizing what your
government is doing to the world...

283
00:18:11,445 --> 00:18:13,811
assholes like us wouldn't exist.

284
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:16,714
- Fuck you! Donuts are awesome!
- They're delicious.

285
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,047
You like donuts?

286
00:18:18,085 --> 00:18:21,316
Well, wait till you see
what they make you eat in here.

287
00:18:21,355 --> 00:18:23,516
- Yeah?
- What do they make you eat in here?

288
00:18:23,557 --> 00:18:25,149
L...

289
00:18:25,192 --> 00:18:27,888
Ever hear of a cockmeat sandwich?

290
00:18:28,729 --> 00:18:30,287
What's a cockmeat sandwich?

291
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:32,993
You're about to find out.

292
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:38,298
Right about now. Sucker.

293
00:18:41,542 --> 00:18:45,740
All right, cockmeat sandwich time.
You know the drill.

294
00:18:45,779 --> 00:18:48,475
What about them? They just got here!

295
00:18:51,385 --> 00:18:52,909
Big Bob's taking care of them.

296
00:18:52,953 --> 00:18:55,421
- Big Bob.
- Big Bob?

297
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,822
I hope you like donuts.

298
00:18:57,858 --> 00:19:00,918
Let's go to work. Hey, listen, guys, enjoy.

299
00:19:03,297 --> 00:19:04,559
Holy shit.

300
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:06,793
Oh, yeah, that's it.

301
00:19:07,768 --> 00:19:11,363
- This is not good.
- No, Kumar, it is not good.

302
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:13,669
- I've never had to suck a dick before.
- Me neither.

303
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,698
I bet it sucks dick.

304
00:19:17,644 --> 00:19:19,339
Shit, dude.

305
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,348
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

306
00:19:21,382 --> 00:19:24,510
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Come on.

307
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:27,247
Please don't let it be Big Bob.
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

308
00:19:27,287 --> 00:19:28,618
Please don't let it be Big Bob.

309
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:30,520
- Please don't let it be Big Bob.
- I'm Big Bob.

310
00:19:30,557 --> 00:19:33,526
- Fuck.
- Yes, you are.

311
00:19:34,995 --> 00:19:37,020
You boys ready
for your cockmeat sandwich?

312
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:40,188
No?

313
00:19:40,234 --> 00:19:42,134
Well, you better get hungry real fast...

314
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,969
'cause I got a whole lot of sandwich
waitin' for ya.

315
00:19:46,907 --> 00:19:48,568
Holy shit!

316
00:19:48,609 --> 00:19:51,806
- All right, let's get goin'.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on, Big Bob...

317
00:19:51,845 --> 00:19:55,372
I got to ask you a question
before this all goes down.

318
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,317
- All the guards in Guantanamo are gay?
- Fuck, no!

319
00:19:58,352 --> 00:20:00,946
Ain't nothing gay
about getting your dick sucked!

320
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:03,821
You're the ones that's gay
for suckin' my dick!

321
00:20:03,857 --> 00:20:05,518
- What?
- In fact...

322
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:09,086
creeps me out
just bein' around you fags.

323
00:20:09,129 --> 00:20:10,562
- But...
- All right.

324
00:20:10,597 --> 00:20:12,792
- Wait...
- Get down on your knees...

325
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,528
- and open your mouths.
- Please, Big Bob.

326
00:20:14,568 --> 00:20:15,762
Why don't you just
kick our ass instead?

327
00:20:15,803 --> 00:20:17,998
- Get on your fucking knees!
- All right. All right.

328
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:21,804
- All right, all right, all right, all right.
- You go first, dude.

329
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:23,901
Hope you boys like extra mayo.

330
00:20:23,944 --> 00:20:26,674
- Jesus, Kumar.
- Oh, I hate you so much!

331
00:20:26,713 --> 00:20:28,146
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

332
00:20:28,182 --> 00:20:30,616
God, his dick smells like shit, dude.

333
00:20:35,355 --> 00:20:37,152
Holy shit!

334
00:20:38,459 --> 00:20:42,759
- What the hell happened?
- That terrorist fuck bit my dick!

335
00:20:47,868 --> 00:20:49,631
- Come on.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait a second!

336
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:52,036
Should we?
What if they kill us out there?

337
00:20:52,072 --> 00:20:53,733
They're gonna fucking make us
suck their dicks if we don't.

338
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,173
We're gonna die in here. Come on.

339
00:20:58,412 --> 00:21:00,505
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

340
00:21:01,081 --> 00:21:03,049
- Shit. Shit.
- Fuck. Fuck.

341
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,142
- Shit. Shit.
- Fuck. Fuck.

342
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:07,153
- Oh, shit! Get out!
- Fuck!

343
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,451
Oh, shit. Shit.

344
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,980
Door, door.

345
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,322
Look, look, look.

346
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:18,991
What the fuck is he doing?

347
00:21:31,111 --> 00:21:34,274
We've got to go
now, now, now, now, now!

348
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,718
It smells like burnt asshole.

349
00:21:42,222 --> 00:21:44,190
I can't fucking believe this.

350
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,249
Fuck!

351
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:52,431
My wrist is swelling, man!

352
00:21:52,466 --> 00:21:54,434
- Shut up.
- We're gonna die in a jungle!

353
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,026
- Shut up!
- Fuck!

354
00:21:56,069 --> 00:21:59,903
Watch out for cheetahs!
This is cheetah turf.

355
00:22:01,141 --> 00:22:03,507
- What?
- OK. Fuck.

356
00:22:03,544 --> 00:22:05,034
We hit ocean.
What do we do now?

357
00:22:06,346 --> 00:22:08,576
All right.

358
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:10,105
Hey, look, look!

359
00:22:14,321 --> 00:22:15,583
Excuse me.

360
00:22:16,924 --> 00:22:18,551
You guys going to America?

361
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,760
Yes, we're going.

362
00:22:21,795 --> 00:22:23,262
Thank you.

363
00:22:24,431 --> 00:22:25,455
I'm telling you, Jorge...

364
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:27,592
the first thing you have to do
when you get to America...

365
00:22:27,634 --> 00:22:30,535
buy a device called TiVo, OK?

366
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:32,937
Freedom means nothing if you're
a slave to regular programming...

367
00:22:32,973 --> 00:22:34,406
I promise you that.

368
00:22:34,441 --> 00:22:36,409
And now, how about you focus?

369
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:38,707
We gotta figure out what to do
when we get to the States.

370
00:22:38,745 --> 00:22:41,578
We don't have wallets. We don't
have any Id. We've got nothing.

371
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:45,312
Well, I figure we're gonna land
somewhere around Miami, right?

372
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,513
There's only one guy we know
who lives down there.

373
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:49,988
- Who do we know that... Raza.
- Yeah.

374
00:22:50,023 --> 00:22:52,116
We gotta go see Raza.

375
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:57,897
- Thanks again.
- What nice people.

376
00:22:57,931 --> 00:23:00,297
Man, South Florida here we are.

377
00:23:00,334 --> 00:23:02,802
OK. So, now how do we get to Raza's?

378
00:23:02,836 --> 00:23:04,770
The professional way.
We walk. Let's go.

379
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:06,272
- Walk?
- Yeah.

380
00:23:06,306 --> 00:23:08,297
So I guess Raza's...

381
00:23:08,342 --> 00:23:10,503
- We'll find it, we'll find it.
...thataway. Yeah.

382
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,992
- Wow, Raza's place is pretty sweet.
- Kinda ghetto for Miami.

383
00:23:34,034 --> 00:23:35,365
- Hi.
- Hey.

384
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:40,896
Y'all aren't here to complain
about the noise, are you?

385
00:23:41,742 --> 00:23:45,041
No. We're not...
here to complain about the noise.

386
00:23:45,078 --> 00:23:47,603
We're...

387
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:51,377
We are here to see...

388
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:53,716
- What is his name? We're here...
- Vagina.

389
00:23:53,754 --> 00:23:57,121
No, we're here to see Raza.

390
00:23:57,157 --> 00:23:59,387
OK. Follow me.

391
00:23:59,426 --> 00:24:00,984
Thank you, ma'am.

392
00:24:01,628 --> 00:24:04,495
We'll follow... you, I guess.

393
00:24:17,577 --> 00:24:18,566
Hey.

394
00:24:19,346 --> 00:24:21,507
- Very patriotic of you.
- Thank you.

395
00:24:22,683 --> 00:24:24,651
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

396
00:24:26,853 --> 00:24:29,117
- Hey, Raza!
- What?

397
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:30,384
What's up?

398
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:31,755
- Kumar and Roldy?
- What's up, man?

399
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:34,420
I haven't seen you guys
since graduation.

400
00:24:34,461 --> 00:24:36,019
What are you guys doing here?

401
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:38,725
Wait, what's up
with the orange jumpsuits?

402
00:24:38,765 --> 00:24:40,232
- Hey, no, no, question number one...
- It's kind of a long story. L...

403
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:41,928
...what's up with this party?
- What do you mean?

404
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:44,436
There's exposed vagina
all over your house.

405
00:24:44,471 --> 00:24:46,837
Yeah. That was my idea.

406
00:24:46,873 --> 00:24:50,536
I don't know about you guys,
I'm sick of all the hype over topless.

407
00:24:50,577 --> 00:24:52,977
Really? I always liked toplessness.
That's...

408
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:54,002
- That's just me.
- Yeah? Well, I'm starting...

409
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:57,642
the bottomless trend.
Hence, the bottomless party.

410
00:24:57,684 --> 00:24:58,673
So what are you guys doing
in South Beach?

411
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:00,812
How about you answer that question?
I'm gonna go check this out.

412
00:25:00,854 --> 00:25:02,583
- Where are you going?
- Bang bang, buddy.

413
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:04,954
Listen. I'm really sorry
to bother you with this.

414
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:06,652
- You all right?
- Not really.

415
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:12,762
They were locked up for less than
an hour, and they already escaped?

416
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,632
Damn it. Make sure the press
doesn't get wind of this.

417
00:25:15,669 --> 00:25:17,637
Don't need the public thinking
we're some two-bit operation.

418
00:25:17,671 --> 00:25:18,660
Got it, sir.

419
00:25:18,705 --> 00:25:20,570
It must have been either al-Qaeda
or North Korea who broke 'em up.

420
00:25:20,607 --> 00:25:22,199
Find out if they have
any relatives in the country.

421
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:25,268
You probably should have
done that in the first place.

422
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:35,119
Do you have a problem with the way
I'm running the show, Beecher?

423
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:37,487
I'm just saying that...

424
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:41,358
I've looked through the files
on Harold Lee and Kumar Patel.

425
00:25:41,394 --> 00:25:42,952
They were both born
and raised in New Jersey.

426
00:25:42,996 --> 00:25:44,827
Other than a couple of traffic tickets,
they're clean.

427
00:25:44,865 --> 00:25:47,197
Right. That's why
they just broke out of prison.

428
00:25:47,234 --> 00:25:50,101
But they... lt's not even clear that they
should have been there in the first place.

429
00:25:50,137 --> 00:25:52,128
Shut your...

430
00:25:59,112 --> 00:26:00,977
You see this cute, little white girl,
Beecher?

431
00:26:01,014 --> 00:26:02,345
Yeah.

432
00:26:02,382 --> 00:26:06,318
Do you want her to get raped
and murdered?

433
00:26:07,721 --> 00:26:08,710
Of course not.

434
00:26:08,755 --> 00:26:11,485
You sure? 'Cause this is America.

435
00:26:12,058 --> 00:26:15,755
- Do you want to rape America?
- No.

436
00:26:15,796 --> 00:26:19,232
Then stop fucking with me.

437
00:26:23,136 --> 00:26:24,603
This is serious.

438
00:26:25,639 --> 00:26:27,539
She's adorable.

439
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,438
So you guys are fucking fugitives?

440
00:26:31,478 --> 00:26:33,708
It's just it's Kumar's fault.

441
00:26:33,747 --> 00:26:35,647
If we get out of this...

442
00:26:35,682 --> 00:26:39,049
the chances of us remaining friends
is highly...

443
00:26:39,085 --> 00:26:40,279
highly... boobies. Yeah.

444
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,345
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

445
00:26:42,389 --> 00:26:44,857
Put that back on. And keep it on.

446
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:47,018
- Sorry.
- Fuckin' party do you think this is?

447
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,153
Yo. What are you guys talking about?

448
00:26:49,196 --> 00:26:51,221
Roldy was just letting me
in on your situation.

449
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,198
- Yeah?
- Thanks for getting me involved.

450
00:26:53,233 --> 00:26:55,167
What about that fuckin' time
we had to cover for you...

451
00:26:55,202 --> 00:26:56,965
lie to your ex-girlfriend
about how you got crabs?

452
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,163
You owe us, man.

453
00:26:58,205 --> 00:26:59,502
- Yeah, that's right.
- What?

454
00:26:59,539 --> 00:27:01,700
- OK, that was a long time ago.
- I love crabs.

455
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:03,538
Speaking of ex-girlfriends...

456
00:27:03,577 --> 00:27:05,306
isn't yours getting married
or something?

457
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:07,279
How does everybody know about this
except for me?

458
00:27:07,314 --> 00:27:08,747
Wait.

459
00:27:09,783 --> 00:27:11,910
Colton! Colton Graham can help us out.

460
00:27:11,952 --> 00:27:13,317
- No! Fuck that!
- Yes!

461
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:16,049
No doubt. If anyone could
clear your names, it's him.

462
00:27:16,089 --> 00:27:17,784
No, I'm sorry.
That dickweed is not helping us.

463
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:19,758
Wait a second.
Do you have his contact info?

464
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:23,820
Not anymore. But the wedding is
at his family's estate in Hewitt, Texas.

465
00:27:24,397 --> 00:27:26,388
But you don't want to bother them
when they're doing their whole...

466
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:28,458
wedding thing, right?

467
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:33,305
You know,
that actually might be our only hope.

468
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,605
Fuck! How do we get there? We can't
go to the airport. They're looking for us.

469
00:27:36,643 --> 00:27:38,235
- I'll loan you one of my cars.
- Really?

470
00:27:38,278 --> 00:27:42,009
But first... y'all got to get
in the spirit of the party.

471
00:27:42,048 --> 00:27:45,245
- What do you mean, spirit of...
- What do you think I mean?

472
00:27:46,052 --> 00:27:49,146
- What about you?
- Me? I've been in the spirit.

473
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:52,220
- Oh, God!
- Oh, my God, dude!

474
00:27:52,259 --> 00:27:53,487
Oh, my God!

475
00:27:53,526 --> 00:27:55,357
- Love your dickdo, Raza.
- Yeah. Drink it in.

476
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:58,592
- What the fuck?
- That looks like Osama bin Laden's beard.

477
00:27:58,632 --> 00:28:00,862
I know, right? All right, boys.

478
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,664
Your turn. Let 'em dangle.

479
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,138
- Let's just do it.
- Bring it.

480
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:08,299
Count of three?

481
00:28:08,341 --> 00:28:10,036
One.

482
00:28:10,076 --> 00:28:11,566
Two, three.

483
00:28:13,914 --> 00:28:16,178
Your cocks are awesome, man!

484
00:28:16,216 --> 00:28:18,548
That's not even necessary.

485
00:28:18,585 --> 00:28:20,712
- Would you please...
- Oh, my dick!

486
00:28:20,754 --> 00:28:22,949
#My dick cost a late-night fee #

487
00:28:22,989 --> 00:28:25,116
#Your dick got the HIV #

488
00:28:25,158 --> 00:28:27,718
#My dick plays on
the double feature screen #

489
00:28:27,761 --> 00:28:30,059
#Your dick went straight to dVd #

490
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:32,656
#My dick bigger than a bridge #

491
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:34,997
#Your dick look like a little kid's #

492
00:28:35,035 --> 00:28:37,936
#My dick large like the Chargers,
the whole team #

493
00:28:37,971 --> 00:28:39,734
#Your shit look like you 14 #

494
00:28:39,773 --> 00:28:42,207
#My dick locked in a cage, right #

495
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:44,369
#Your dick suffer from stage fright #

496
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:47,039
#My dick so hot it's stolen #

497
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,571
#Your dick look like Gary Coleman #

498
00:28:49,616 --> 00:28:52,107
#My dick pink and big #

499
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:56,350
- This car is frickin' sweet.
- Yeah, yeah, it's sweet.

500
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:57,913
'Cause we're fugitives.

501
00:28:57,958 --> 00:29:00,950
Driving a yellow convertible
with the top down, dressed like assholes!

502
00:29:00,994 --> 00:29:03,986
Yo. Yo. Yo, look, he has
one of these things.

503
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,021
- Would you put that down?
- No, you can hook up to the Internet.

504
00:29:06,066 --> 00:29:08,728
You can play M/ke Tyson's Punch-Out//
on it. King Hippo's going down.

505
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:10,633
Put that away. Put that away.

506
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,470
I can't believe you can even think about
playing games at a time like this, man.

507
00:29:14,507 --> 00:29:17,135
You realize what would happen
if our parents found out about this?

508
00:29:17,711 --> 00:29:20,544
You have sent our sons
to Guantanamo Bay?

509
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,741
This is an outrage!

510
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,749
You Arabs think you can just mix in
with our peaceful society...

511
00:29:26,786 --> 00:29:27,946
and we're not gonna find you, huh?

512
00:29:27,988 --> 00:29:30,422
I am not Arab! I am Indian!

513
00:29:30,457 --> 00:29:34,951
Look, Chief. I'm not here to argue
seblantics with you, OK?

514
00:29:34,995 --> 00:29:37,054
I'm here to save lives.

515
00:29:37,097 --> 00:29:40,191
Ask the Lees what they know
about their son's terrorist activity.

516
00:29:49,943 --> 00:29:53,811
Look, we have been American citizens
for over 40 years.

517
00:29:53,847 --> 00:29:57,339
Now, frankly, I find this very offensive.

518
00:29:59,486 --> 00:30:03,889
They're using some sort of dialect
I've never heard before.

519
00:30:03,923 --> 00:30:07,086
But I'm pretty sure he said something
about going on the offensive.

520
00:30:08,962 --> 00:30:12,227
Tell them we know
what their son is up to...

521
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:15,132
and if they don't cooperate,
he could be sentenced to death.

522
00:30:16,736 --> 00:30:18,931
Hit 'em. Yeah.

523
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:24,843
We know what he said!

524
00:30:24,878 --> 00:30:27,870
Sir, Harold and Kumar are good boys.

525
00:30:31,551 --> 00:30:33,781
I'm a pretty good translator.

526
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,583
It's total gibberish.

527
00:30:37,357 --> 00:30:38,847
They may be trying to stonewall us.

528
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:42,058
Are you sure you speak Korean, Jack?

529
00:30:42,095 --> 00:30:43,084
You speak Korean?

530
00:30:43,129 --> 00:30:44,926
You're not fucking with daddy, are you?

531
00:30:44,964 --> 00:30:49,025
Do you have a masters
in romantic Korean literature?

532
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:51,094
Because I do...

533
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,695
and I'm offended.

534
00:30:53,907 --> 00:30:54,896
Good enough for me.

535
00:30:55,842 --> 00:30:57,969
Look, excuse me...

536
00:30:58,011 --> 00:31:00,377
we're not looking to hurt your sons...

537
00:31:00,413 --> 00:31:02,813
we just wanna know where they are.

538
00:31:02,849 --> 00:31:05,044
Do you know if they know anybody
in Florida?

539
00:31:06,219 --> 00:31:09,552
Their friend Raza Syed lives in Miami.

540
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:11,623
But why would they be there?

541
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:13,421
He's supposed to be in medical school.

542
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:18,625
They are supposed to be in prison!
That is where terrorists belong!

543
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,827
These fuckers are goin' down.

544
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,770
Dead. Or alive.

545
00:31:25,805 --> 00:31:29,104
Tell them that in your fake
ching-chong language.

546
00:31:31,244 --> 00:31:32,609
Shut up! You're an idiot.

547
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,240
I don't know what you're saying, buddy...

548
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:38,272
but fuck you.

549
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:39,410
- Fuck me?
- Will you let him talk to you like that?

550
00:31:39,452 --> 00:31:41,647
- Listen, no, sit down.
- Fuck me?

551
00:31:49,629 --> 00:31:51,824
Hey, look, man, we're in Alabama.

552
00:31:52,999 --> 00:31:55,263
Wow, we actually get a first-hand look
at the South, huh?

553
00:31:55,301 --> 00:31:58,862
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip
through the South, OK?

554
00:31:58,905 --> 00:32:01,396
This was supposed to be
the most romantic week of my life.

555
00:32:01,441 --> 00:32:04,137
Remember that? Before you
fucked it up? You remember that?

556
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:06,372
Just chill, OK?
We'll be out of this situation.

557
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:09,609
You'll be up in Maria's guts
in no time, all right?

558
00:32:09,649 --> 00:32:13,608
Hey. She's not some skank, man.

559
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:17,851
I've never felt this way
about anyone before, really.

560
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:21,491
What the fuck?
Why am I talking to you about this?

561
00:32:21,528 --> 00:32:23,826
It's not like you would understand, so...

562
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:44,908
Excuse me, please.
Will you turn that off? This is a library.

563
00:32:47,487 --> 00:32:49,318
What a fucking chode.

564
00:32:49,355 --> 00:32:51,346
Thank you, come again!

565
00:32:57,697 --> 00:32:59,824
- What the fuck?!
- Oh, my God.

566
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,458
You know, the whole reason
people come to the stacks...

567
00:33:01,501 --> 00:33:04,026
is for some peace and...

568
00:33:05,038 --> 00:33:06,596
quiet.

569
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:09,472
Look, I know, I'm sorry. I hate it
when people disturb me here too.

570
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:12,637
It's just this fucking calculus final
is killing me.

571
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,082
- Do you mind if I take a look?
- No.

572
00:33:18,117 --> 00:33:22,247
- You're actually very close. May I?
- Yeah.

573
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:24,085
Excuse me.

574
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:30,856
I touched your breast.

575
00:33:30,897 --> 00:33:33,365
- It's OK.
- Sorry.

576
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:37,970
You just go...

577
00:33:40,006 --> 00:33:42,907
Wow. You're good at this.

578
00:33:42,942 --> 00:33:44,204
Thanks.

579
00:33:44,244 --> 00:33:46,940
What did you, like, take calculus
in high school or something?

580
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,972
Actually, my dad taught it to me
in sixth grade.

581
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:52,541
What, are you like doogie Howser?

582
00:33:52,585 --> 00:33:55,816
No. Although that would be incredible.
He's my hero.

583
00:33:55,855 --> 00:33:58,346
I love that show.

584
00:33:59,826 --> 00:34:00,986
What are you working on there?

585
00:34:01,027 --> 00:34:03,928
This is just a poem
for my creative writing class.

586
00:34:03,963 --> 00:34:06,295
It's like...

587
00:34:06,332 --> 00:34:08,129
- "The Square Root Of Three"?
- No, no, I'm sorry...

588
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,965
- "A poem of love by Kumar Patel."
- I need this.

589
00:34:11,004 --> 00:34:13,063
- Hey, let me read it.
- No, no.

590
00:34:13,106 --> 00:34:15,336
- Why?
- Because it's lame.

591
00:34:15,375 --> 00:34:16,399
Then read it to me.

592
00:34:16,442 --> 00:34:20,435
There's no way I'm letting you see me
in that light. Good luck with your calculus.

593
00:34:21,481 --> 00:34:25,850
Come on, don't be embarrassed. You
know, a lot of girls find intelligence sexy.

594
00:34:25,885 --> 00:34:28,877
Look, I'm not even gonna be
showing this to my professor, all right?

595
00:34:28,921 --> 00:34:31,116
That's why I'm so stressed out
right now.

596
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:33,387
Stressed out, huh?

597
00:34:33,426 --> 00:34:35,326
Come with me.

598
00:34:36,529 --> 00:34:38,861
...going?
- Come on.

599
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,626
What?

600
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:51,967
You're smoking drugs in the library?
What if somebody catches us?

601
00:34:52,612 --> 00:34:55,240
Don't worry. It'll help you relax.

602
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:57,749
Oh, boy.

603
00:34:57,784 --> 00:35:00,252
It's illegal.

604
00:35:08,561 --> 00:35:09,755
Here.

605
00:35:17,937 --> 00:35:19,666
This is poison.

606
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:23,302
Let me help you.

607
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:44,220
I'm Kumar.

608
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:47,162
Vanessa.

609
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,566
You're still not reading that poem.

610
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:04,845
Kumar.

611
00:36:09,055 --> 00:36:10,044
Kumar.

612
00:36:10,089 --> 00:36:11,920
Kumar. Kumar.

613
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:14,327
- Kumar.
- Yeah.

614
00:36:14,327 --> 00:36:17,592
What's going on? We're in Birmingham,
Alabama. Are we supposed to be here?

615
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:19,791
What's going on?

616
00:36:19,832 --> 00:36:21,959
- Why did you bring us here, dude?
- What do you mean, why did l...

617
00:36:22,001 --> 00:36:25,266
You were supposed to be following the
directions, asshole. What do you mean?

618
00:36:25,304 --> 00:36:27,898
There's got to be like a highway
or something, right?

619
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,238
Yeah, there's got to be a highway.

620
00:36:31,177 --> 00:36:33,042
What's going on up there?

621
00:36:38,084 --> 00:36:40,552
What the hell is this?

622
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:46,485
- I'm turning around.
- Nah, just go through, man.

623
00:36:47,293 --> 00:36:49,193
Dude, we're not driving
through this basketball game.

624
00:36:49,228 --> 00:36:51,856
You know, Roldy, I really thought
you were bigger than this.

625
00:36:51,898 --> 00:36:54,230
Dude, I'm not scared
'cause they're black.

626
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:55,529
I'm scared because they're scary.

627
00:36:55,568 --> 00:36:57,934
And it's not like we got
Gregory Hines out there.

628
00:36:57,970 --> 00:36:58,959
They're not that scary.

629
00:37:00,706 --> 00:37:03,266
It's my ball!

630
00:37:03,309 --> 00:37:04,776
Turn around.

631
00:37:12,351 --> 00:37:14,683
- Fuck! It won't move!
- Shit, dude.

632
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:19,848
- That's not good.
- Now there's no music, man.

633
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,484
Shit, man.

634
00:37:21,527 --> 00:37:24,462
- Motherfucker!
- My Jordans, nigga!

635
00:37:24,497 --> 00:37:26,362
- Shit, this isn't good.
- This is not good. This is not good.

636
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,930
No. No. No.

637
00:37:29,969 --> 00:37:31,493
They're coming over here.

638
00:37:32,205 --> 00:37:36,471
- Fucking shit. Why did you do that?
- Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose.

639
00:37:37,477 --> 00:37:39,877
They're getting weapons, man.

640
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:41,345
All right, what do we do?
What do we do?

641
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,678
Run, run, run. Run, run.

642
00:37:49,088 --> 00:37:51,852
Yo. Yo.

643
00:37:52,758 --> 00:37:55,659
- Where y'all going? Damn!
- We was just trying to help.

644
00:37:55,695 --> 00:37:59,859
Man, somebody call the police.
We need to report this.

645
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:18,574
- Yeah, that's right. You like the ride?
- Fuck you, man.

646
00:38:18,618 --> 00:38:23,248
They abandoned it last night.
It's registered to a Raza Syed.

647
00:38:23,289 --> 00:38:25,780
The witnesses' description
of the driver and passenger...

648
00:38:25,825 --> 00:38:28,658
match that of Lee and Patel.

649
00:38:29,962 --> 00:38:34,023
We tried bringing in Syed last night,
but he's already left the country.

650
00:38:35,201 --> 00:38:38,102
Well, they know we're closing in on 'em,
that's why.

651
00:38:38,137 --> 00:38:40,731
OK. No, I'll give you a call. All right.

652
00:38:42,475 --> 00:38:44,568
No, no, no, no!

653
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,941
- Holy shit!
- Easy, easy!

654
00:38:45,978 --> 00:38:47,775
- Easy.
- Easy!

655
00:38:47,813 --> 00:38:49,542
This is our witness.

656
00:38:49,582 --> 00:38:51,447
Put it down! Yo, put it down!

657
00:38:56,656 --> 00:39:00,888
So, you saw the fugitives, huh?

658
00:39:00,927 --> 00:39:03,487
Yeah. It was like
I was telling the Sheriff...

659
00:39:03,529 --> 00:39:07,465
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
How do I know you're telling the truth?

660
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,365
I don't have a reason
to lie to you, man.

661
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:10,767
Really?

662
00:39:10,803 --> 00:39:13,601
- Get up in your face, man.
- We'll see.

663
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:17,442
Where's he going?

664
00:39:19,178 --> 00:39:20,873
What's going on?

665
00:39:24,617 --> 00:39:25,606
Hell no!

666
00:39:25,651 --> 00:39:27,983
Now why don't you tell me
what really happened?

667
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,885
Is that grape soda?

668
00:39:29,922 --> 00:39:31,787
What the fuck, yo?

669
00:39:34,694 --> 00:39:36,889
- All right.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on!

670
00:39:36,929 --> 00:39:38,362
This is so ignorant.

671
00:39:38,397 --> 00:39:40,388
- Really?
- Yes.

672
00:39:40,433 --> 00:39:42,401
Is this ignorant?

673
00:39:42,435 --> 00:39:44,926
Yo, that's racist, man. That's racist.

674
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:47,098
Hey, Jon, are you gonna let him do that?

675
00:39:47,873 --> 00:39:50,171
See if he got Kool-Aid.

676
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,109
Almost gone, witness.

677
00:39:52,144 --> 00:39:54,078
Sure there's not something
you wanna tell me?

678
00:39:54,113 --> 00:39:56,013
I'm not stoppin' until you crack!

679
00:39:56,048 --> 00:39:57,140
I already told you
that they took off runnin'!

680
00:39:57,183 --> 00:39:58,514
All right, all right, all right.

681
00:39:58,551 --> 00:40:01,247
This isn't necessary!
Mr. White is telling you the truth!

682
00:40:01,287 --> 00:40:03,847
Yeah, and how can you be
so sure, Beecher?

683
00:40:03,889 --> 00:40:07,325
'Cause he doesn't have a police record.
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.

684
00:40:09,395 --> 00:40:13,661
OK, then, Beech. How do you
propose we find the terrorists, huh?

685
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,367
There was a Nokia 7710
taken from the console.

686
00:40:17,403 --> 00:40:18,665
We have its tracking numbers.

687
00:40:18,704 --> 00:40:21,832
Our satellites are running a trace on it,
as we speak.

688
00:40:23,976 --> 00:40:25,204
What's going on? Where are you?

689
00:40:25,244 --> 00:40:26,643
Dude, that is a fucking long story.

690
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:29,671
We're actually in Alabama right now,
heading to Texas.

691
00:40:31,217 --> 00:40:33,310
What is that sound? Are you jerking off
again? What are you doing?

692
00:40:33,352 --> 00:40:35,650
I'm taking a glorious pee-pee.

693
00:40:35,688 --> 00:40:37,747
Hey, listen, you're not gonna believe this...

694
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,418
but the other night,
I ended up at that Asian party...

695
00:40:40,459 --> 00:40:43,019
and I schtupped Cindy Kim.

696
00:40:43,062 --> 00:40:45,030
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?

697
00:40:45,064 --> 00:40:47,191
Yeah, man,
she even gave me a blumpkin.

698
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:48,495
What is a blumpkin?

699
00:40:48,534 --> 00:40:51,628
It's when a girl gives you head while
you're sitting on the toilet takin' a shit.

700
00:40:51,671 --> 00:40:53,298
Really?

701
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:55,899
- Hello?
- Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

702
00:40:55,941 --> 00:40:58,466
Hello? Come, come?

703
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:01,679
Did you go?

704
00:41:01,714 --> 00:41:03,181
Yeah, I'm done.

705
00:41:03,215 --> 00:41:06,150
You said to me we were gonna
cross swords. You promised.

706
00:41:06,185 --> 00:41:07,982
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

707
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:12,650
Are you talking on a cellphone
when the government is looking for us?

708
00:41:12,692 --> 00:41:15,183
Dude, it was just Goldstein.
I had something important to tell him.

709
00:41:15,227 --> 00:41:16,990
It's 'cause you had something...
That's good, that's OK.

710
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:22,592
Nothing is more important
than finding a way to get to Texas.

711
00:41:22,635 --> 00:41:23,624
- Do you get it?
- Yes.

712
00:41:23,669 --> 00:41:28,072
We've been walking an entire day
and we have not seen a street sign.

713
00:41:28,107 --> 00:41:29,233
Do you get it?

714
00:41:29,275 --> 00:41:32,540
- Can I say...
- Again. This is... I can't.

715
00:41:32,578 --> 00:41:33,772
Dude, honestly...

716
00:41:33,813 --> 00:41:37,180
you've got to be a little more positive
about these things, all right?

717
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:40,481
- Yeah?
- Positive about what? I don't...

718
00:41:40,519 --> 00:41:43,920
First of all, look at this beautiful
Alabama landscape, OK?

719
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:47,050
You don't get shit like this in New Jersey.

720
00:41:47,893 --> 00:41:49,292
God, you...

721
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:50,828
Hey, look, dude.

722
00:41:50,863 --> 00:41:52,763
It's a baby deer.

723
00:41:53,566 --> 00:41:57,127
- Wow. Man.
- Shit.

724
00:41:59,772 --> 00:42:02,605
Hey. Hey.

725
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:06,099
Look how cute this deer is, dude. Not
like those asshole deer in New Jersey.

726
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:07,635
I know, man.

727
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,205
- Hey, buddy.
- Dude, Alabama's awesome.

728
00:42:10,249 --> 00:42:12,046
He likes you.

729
00:42:12,918 --> 00:42:15,546
- Oh, my God!
- No!

730
00:42:18,557 --> 00:42:21,492
Sorry about that. I was in my zone.

731
00:42:24,663 --> 00:42:28,326
What the hell are y'all doing out here
in them fancy clothes?

732
00:42:28,367 --> 00:42:30,892
We were on our way to Texas
and we got lost.

733
00:42:30,936 --> 00:42:32,426
Texas?

734
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:35,700
You're a long way from Texas.

735
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:37,065
No!

736
00:42:40,746 --> 00:42:43,408
Born in '04.

737
00:42:43,449 --> 00:42:45,110
Get in here.

738
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,514
Yeah. The sun's about to go down.

739
00:42:51,557 --> 00:42:55,357
- Y'all need a place to stay? Ya hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

740
00:42:55,394 --> 00:42:57,453
You want to follow me?

741
00:42:58,364 --> 00:42:59,956
Come on.

742
00:43:00,966 --> 00:43:02,957
Maybe we shouldn't.

743
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:06,366
It's already dead.
You need a hand, dude?

744
00:43:07,006 --> 00:43:09,600
My grandpappy
bought this land in 1902.

745
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:12,110
Very nice, sir.

746
00:43:12,144 --> 00:43:14,374
This place is gonna suck.

747
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:21,078
Honey, I'm home.

748
00:43:27,593 --> 00:43:28,958
I'm in here.

749
00:43:32,364 --> 00:43:35,265
I wish you'd-a told me
you was bringing guests home.

750
00:43:35,301 --> 00:43:37,166
I'da straightened up in here.

751
00:43:37,203 --> 00:43:39,296
Fellas, this is my wife Raylene.

752
00:43:39,338 --> 00:43:41,966
Raylene, meet Harold and Kumar.

753
00:43:42,007 --> 00:43:43,474
Hello.

754
00:43:43,509 --> 00:43:47,775
Can't shake.
I've just got... deer head all over me.

755
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:50,111
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you boys.

756
00:43:50,149 --> 00:43:52,640
- You just make yourselves at home.
- Thank you.

757
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:54,243
Honey, something's wrong
with that dSL.

758
00:43:54,286 --> 00:43:57,346
Every time I go on the online,
it says, "Searching for server."

759
00:43:57,389 --> 00:43:59,254
You try unplugging the AirPort base?

760
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:01,418
Yeah, I done did that but it didn't work.

761
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,984
What you need to go online fors,
anyways?

762
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:06,156
I was gonna get one of them
new portable satellite radios.

763
00:44:06,198 --> 00:44:08,826
What the fuck
you need a satellite radio for?

764
00:44:08,868 --> 00:44:11,166
Don't you be cussin'
when we got company over.

765
00:44:11,203 --> 00:44:12,329
- Guys.
- Please don't worry about us.

766
00:44:12,371 --> 00:44:13,668
We cuss all the time.

767
00:44:13,706 --> 00:44:15,037
Who do you think you is, hitting me?

768
00:44:15,074 --> 00:44:17,201
Who do you think bought you
that Prada bag?

769
00:44:17,243 --> 00:44:19,108
I told you I wanted a Gucci one.

770
00:44:19,144 --> 00:44:20,406
The Gucci bag cost more!

771
00:44:20,446 --> 00:44:22,744
Well, Jan Sapperstein's husband
sure could afford it.

772
00:44:22,781 --> 00:44:24,942
Here we go again with Jan Sapperstein.

773
00:44:24,984 --> 00:44:27,248
I don't give a rat's ass what that bitch got.

774
00:44:27,286 --> 00:44:28,548
You be happy with what you have.

775
00:44:28,587 --> 00:44:31,249
What I have is a husband
who ain't worth a turd!

776
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,655
You wanna give me shit now?

777
00:44:32,691 --> 00:44:34,750
- That's right!
- After everything I let you buy!

778
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:36,192
Even look at the credit card bills?

779
00:44:36,228 --> 00:44:38,924
...you buy?! Do you think we need
another set of golf balls?

780
00:44:38,964 --> 00:44:41,899
- Even worse is the credit card miles.
- Stinky, smelly, motherf...

781
00:44:41,934 --> 00:44:43,731
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.

782
00:44:43,769 --> 00:44:47,466
Nonsense. Don't be silly.
You're our guests.

783
00:44:47,506 --> 00:44:49,974
You guys have got to stay for supper.

784
00:44:50,009 --> 00:44:51,601
- No, we couldn't. That's...
- No, thank you. We really couldn't...

785
00:44:51,644 --> 00:44:56,047
Of course, we're gonna
have to get high first.

786
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:21,262
We're close.

787
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,108
This is news to me.
I never knew farmers smoked weed.

788
00:45:31,150 --> 00:45:34,608
You ever tried farmin' not high?
It's borin' as shit.

789
00:45:34,653 --> 00:45:36,644
You know, this is great, guys.

790
00:45:36,689 --> 00:45:38,782
I kind of always,
you know, sort of assumed...

791
00:45:38,824 --> 00:45:42,191
that people from the South
were kinda...

792
00:45:42,227 --> 00:45:44,127
A bunch of dumb rednecks?

793
00:45:44,163 --> 00:45:46,791
- No.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not...

794
00:45:46,832 --> 00:45:50,768
We do try to keep our inbred son in
the basement when we have company.

795
00:45:50,803 --> 00:45:53,135
Guys, I didn't mean it like that. I was just...

796
00:45:57,242 --> 00:45:59,107
Look at their faces!

797
00:46:04,450 --> 00:46:05,439
Fuck, fuck!

798
00:46:05,484 --> 00:46:07,145
Shit, they found us.
They found us. They found us.

799
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:08,778
- What do you mean, they found you?
- Listen, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

800
00:46:08,821 --> 00:46:10,812
Are you boys in some kind of trouble?

801
00:46:10,856 --> 00:46:13,689
All right. This is gonna sound crazy,
but, basically...

802
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:14,988
we were on a plane to Amsterdam...

803
00:46:15,027 --> 00:46:17,689
and we got mistaken for terrorists
and we got sent to Guantanamo Bay...

804
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:19,857
and then we escaped and snuck
into America with a bunch of Cubans...

805
00:46:19,898 --> 00:46:20,922
and now we're trying to get to Texas...

806
00:46:20,966 --> 00:46:21,955
where there's a guy
who can help us out...

807
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:23,901
and he's getting married
to Kumar's ex-girlfriend.

808
00:46:23,936 --> 00:46:25,665
Yes.

809
00:46:26,538 --> 00:46:29,234
OK. That's cool.

810
00:46:29,274 --> 00:46:31,708
- I understand that.
- You do?

811
00:46:31,744 --> 00:46:35,976
Like the government's never screwed
us over before. You know what?

812
00:46:36,015 --> 00:46:38,074
Y'all come down here and hide
in the basement. I will handle this.

813
00:46:38,117 --> 00:46:39,550
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.

814
00:46:39,585 --> 00:46:41,553
Thank you, thank you.

815
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:53,864
OK. This isn't creepy.

816
00:46:57,403 --> 00:46:58,836
What the hell is that?

817
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:03,435
You're walking
towards the creepy music?

818
00:47:04,009 --> 00:47:05,271
Ge...

819
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:06,868
This song rocks, dude.

820
00:47:13,652 --> 00:47:14,641
Kumar.

821
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:23,923
Hey, dude, there's a lighter here
with a clown on it.

822
00:47:25,397 --> 00:47:26,921
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!

823
00:47:27,699 --> 00:47:28,757
God!

824
00:47:39,845 --> 00:47:43,008
Hey, you don't happen to have
a Baby Ruth on you, do you?

825
00:47:43,048 --> 00:47:45,608
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?

826
00:47:45,651 --> 00:47:48,586
That's how Chunk won over Sloth
in The Goon/es.

827
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,554
This thing looks like Sloth?

828
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:52,750
All I saw was the creature's hand.

829
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:54,486
The hand looks like Sloth?

830
00:47:54,526 --> 00:47:58,656
The fucking hand of an evil monster,
dude. Like fucking claws and shit.

831
00:47:58,697 --> 00:48:00,494
Shit.

832
00:48:00,532 --> 00:48:04,901
Listen, no matter what, don't let
the creature know that it's ugly, OK?

833
00:48:04,937 --> 00:48:07,838
The last thing that we want to do
is criticize it or make it feel different...

834
00:48:07,873 --> 00:48:10,603
just because it was born
with horrible deformities.

835
00:48:21,153 --> 00:48:24,384
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em.
It was just my neighbors.

836
00:48:24,423 --> 00:48:25,447
- There's a fricking Cyclops...
- No, you got...

837
00:48:25,491 --> 00:48:27,550
...in your basement, man!
...a fucking thing, dude!

838
00:48:27,593 --> 00:48:28,787
You met Cyrus.

839
00:48:28,827 --> 00:48:30,021
- Cyrus.
- You named it?

840
00:48:30,062 --> 00:48:31,290
Our son.

841
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:34,265
You must have woke him up. He was
supposed to be asleep. I'm sorry.

842
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:35,891
I thought you were joking...

843
00:48:35,934 --> 00:48:38,459
when you said you had an inbred son
who lives in your basement.

844
00:48:38,504 --> 00:48:40,131
Well, it ain't a joke.

845
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:43,471
Raylene and I here are siblings,
and we get it on.

846
00:48:43,509 --> 00:48:45,807
But that don't mean
we ought to be judged.

847
00:48:45,844 --> 00:48:48,608
You boys must be awful tired
after what you've been through.

848
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:50,080
Come with me,
I'll show you to your bed.

849
00:48:50,115 --> 00:48:52,140
You better go back to sleep, boy!

850
00:48:52,184 --> 00:48:55,176
Don't make me come down there
and whip your Cyclops ass!

851
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:59,150
It's tough love.

852
00:48:59,191 --> 00:49:01,182
It's the best way.

853
00:49:18,977 --> 00:49:22,037
I don't know what I was thinking
dating that douchebag Colton.

854
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,379
He is a douchebag.
What were you thinking?

855
00:49:25,417 --> 00:49:29,114
But it was agony pretending
his puny, little penis satisfied me.

856
00:49:29,154 --> 00:49:33,716
I bet. I bet you've been missing
the thundercock too, haven't you, baby?

857
00:49:33,759 --> 00:49:36,023
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

858
00:49:36,061 --> 00:49:37,688
Yeah, you've been missing it?

859
00:49:37,729 --> 00:49:38,855
How much?

860
00:49:38,897 --> 00:49:41,798
- A lot.
- I bet.

861
00:49:42,801 --> 00:49:44,598
Well...

862
00:49:44,636 --> 00:49:48,265
- I kind of have this fantasy.
- What is it?

863
00:49:48,307 --> 00:49:52,368
I thought it'd be kinda cool
to bring somebody else in bed with us.

864
00:49:53,579 --> 00:49:55,444
Who?

865
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,209
Hey, baby.

866
00:50:03,922 --> 00:50:05,150
- Yeah!
- Yeah?

867
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:07,988
- Yeah.
- She's hot, right?

868
00:50:08,026 --> 00:50:09,050
Let's do it.

869
00:50:17,869 --> 00:50:19,461
Faster, Weedy.

870
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:33,646
Teeth, teeth, Weedy, teeth.

871
00:50:36,088 --> 00:50:37,783
- Weedy!
- Yeah?

872
00:50:37,823 --> 00:50:40,690
- Yeah!
- You like that?

873
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:51,032
Putting it in the ass now, Weedy.

874
00:50:54,039 --> 00:50:55,063
Yeah, how about that?

875
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:23,195
Wow.

876
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:29,605
Dude.

877
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:32,703
I just had the most
fucked-up nightmare.

878
00:51:32,744 --> 00:51:36,805
Come on, man.
I was having a really hot dream.

879
00:51:36,848 --> 00:51:39,510
Go back to bed, please, dude.

880
00:52:11,383 --> 00:52:14,086
Why did we have to leave?
Their Goon/es child was kind of cute.

881
00:52:14,086 --> 00:52:16,611
I don't care. It tried to fucking bite me.

882
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:18,748
Jesus, every time the two of us
try to get anywhere...

883
00:52:18,790 --> 00:52:21,486
it's fucking disaster
after fucking disaster.

884
00:52:21,526 --> 00:52:23,289
Jesus, dude.
Here, you really need a hit of this.

885
00:52:23,328 --> 00:52:25,922
Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!

886
00:52:25,964 --> 00:52:28,262
It's your solution to everything,
you know that?

887
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:31,269
Think about it.
We should be at Colton's already.

888
00:52:31,303 --> 00:52:34,568
Hey, chill, we still have two days
to fuck up the wedding.

889
00:52:34,606 --> 00:52:36,665
- What?
- What?

890
00:52:37,175 --> 00:52:38,767
- What?
- What?

891
00:52:39,211 --> 00:52:43,545
That's what this is all about, isn't it?
You want to fuck up the wedding.

892
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:46,915
It's not fucking funny, Kumar.
It's not fucking funny!

893
00:52:47,352 --> 00:52:49,445
Colton is the only guy
that can help us out at this point.

894
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:52,116
I can't believe... I cannot believe
you're willing to fuck that up!

895
00:52:52,157 --> 00:52:54,057
I just hate that fucking asshole, OK?

896
00:52:54,092 --> 00:52:56,856
Yeah? I like him better
than I like you right now.

897
00:52:56,895 --> 00:52:59,090
- Really?
- Yeah.

898
00:52:59,131 --> 00:53:01,122
You know what he got me? A job.

899
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:05,102
You know what you got me?
Thrown into Guantanamo Bay.

900
00:53:05,137 --> 00:53:06,832
- Your job sucks.
- Admit it.

901
00:53:06,872 --> 00:53:09,705
You're jealous because Vanessa
found somebody better than you.

902
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:11,299
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

903
00:53:11,343 --> 00:53:13,937
Better than you! Let me think.

904
00:53:13,979 --> 00:53:17,471
Potential future president,
or unemployed pothead?

905
00:53:17,516 --> 00:53:20,041
Tough. That's tough.
That's a tough one for her, isn't it?

906
00:53:20,085 --> 00:53:22,383
Yeah, well at least
Vanessa's not in Amsterdam...

907
00:53:22,421 --> 00:53:24,252
getting plowed
by a bunch of European dudes.

908
00:53:25,424 --> 00:53:26,891
- What?
- Do you really think Maria's...

909
00:53:26,925 --> 00:53:28,392
saving herself for you, dude?

910
00:53:28,427 --> 00:53:30,361
Right now, she's probably got
two uncircumcised dicks...

911
00:53:30,395 --> 00:53:31,487
dangling in front of her throat.

912
00:53:31,530 --> 00:53:34,988
You know what she's gonna do with them?
Down 'em into her tonsils?

913
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:41,464
Fucking dick.

914
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:47,142
- That's my hat.
- That was my hat, bro.

915
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:51,175
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

916
00:53:51,583 --> 00:53:53,073
Asshole!

917
00:53:53,118 --> 00:53:55,951
Don't you dare say a fucking word
about my angel!

918
00:53:58,423 --> 00:54:00,254
What the fuck was that?

919
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:02,351
Get up. Get up!

920
00:54:02,394 --> 00:54:04,362
Fuck you.

921
00:54:13,572 --> 00:54:15,164
Shit.

922
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:21,645
Isn't that a KKK bonfire?

923
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,840
Yeah.

924
00:54:24,216 --> 00:54:26,116
Yeah, I think it is.

925
00:54:26,918 --> 00:54:29,113
Maybe we should
get the fuck out of here.

926
00:54:29,154 --> 00:54:31,179
Yeah. Yeah, dude.

927
00:54:31,223 --> 00:54:33,555
Let's do that.

928
00:54:36,528 --> 00:54:39,361
The other day, caught a rerun
of that show Becker.

929
00:54:39,397 --> 00:54:40,830
You know that show?

930
00:54:40,866 --> 00:54:44,302
Yeah, that's the one
with that Jew, Ted danson.

931
00:54:44,336 --> 00:54:47,772
That blond negro they got on there,
he had me in stitches.

932
00:54:47,806 --> 00:54:49,364
He's actually pretty funny.

933
00:54:49,407 --> 00:54:51,637
Really? You think so?

934
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:54,474
I'm not saying I wouldn't
lynch the guy, but...

935
00:54:54,513 --> 00:54:57,311
his timing, it's priceless.

936
00:54:58,049 --> 00:55:00,347
Hold up a second.

937
00:55:00,385 --> 00:55:03,047
I gotta go drain the main vein.

938
00:55:20,038 --> 00:55:22,233
I'll tell ya, Travis...

939
00:55:22,274 --> 00:55:24,640
when it comes to feeling good...

940
00:55:24,676 --> 00:55:27,702
I'd rate pissin' right up there
with comin' and shittin'.

941
00:55:29,748 --> 00:55:31,306
I like to do all three.

942
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:32,577
Yeah, I hear ya.

943
00:55:34,786 --> 00:55:37,880
Kenny, come on, man.
Hurry the fuck up.

944
00:55:38,823 --> 00:55:42,224
You were the one who made me
drink that third beer.

945
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:44,694
Hold your horses, peckerwood.

946
00:55:45,564 --> 00:55:47,964
Gross! You fucking pissed on me!

947
00:55:47,999 --> 00:55:50,297
- You racist fuck!
- What the heck?

948
00:55:57,075 --> 00:55:59,100
What the nigger was that?

949
00:56:01,146 --> 00:56:03,740
This is fucked. We are fucked.

950
00:56:03,782 --> 00:56:05,682
Kenny. Travis.

951
00:56:07,218 --> 00:56:09,880
What in the tarnation you guys doin'?

952
00:56:09,921 --> 00:56:12,082
Good, you brought the keg.
Lug that thing over.

953
00:56:12,123 --> 00:56:13,488
- Let's go! Come on!
- Come on!

954
00:56:13,525 --> 00:56:15,789
Let's go, come on!

955
00:56:27,105 --> 00:56:29,835
Yeah, then you put little onions on 'em
and you steam 'em, they're awesome.

956
00:56:29,874 --> 00:56:33,469
Roldy, dude, I'd never thought
I'd say this in a million years...

957
00:56:33,511 --> 00:56:35,103
but the Klan really knows how to party.

958
00:56:35,146 --> 00:56:36,977
You gotta try these dogs.

959
00:56:37,015 --> 00:56:38,004
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

960
00:56:38,049 --> 00:56:40,745
Really know how to...
the Klan knows how to party?

961
00:56:40,785 --> 00:56:42,810
- Dude, we've got to get out of here!
- Jeez, all right, dude, relax.

962
00:56:42,854 --> 00:56:46,312
All right, y'all! Come on over here
and we'll sit around the campfire.

963
00:56:46,358 --> 00:56:48,826
- Shit, what do we do?
- Let's go sit down.

964
00:56:48,860 --> 00:56:50,088
Rufus. Next to them marshmallows...

965
00:56:50,128 --> 00:56:52,358
- and the graham crackers.
- Everybody sit down.

966
00:56:52,397 --> 00:56:54,922
Best s'mores we've had in a long time...

967
00:56:54,966 --> 00:56:57,161
that's what I'm talking about,
that's what I'm talking about.

968
00:56:57,202 --> 00:57:00,933
Now. Now I want
each one of y'all to tell me...

969
00:57:00,972 --> 00:57:03,600
somethin'... Porch monkey, kike!

970
00:57:03,642 --> 00:57:06,543
...that you did
to a minority this week. Yeah.

971
00:57:06,578 --> 00:57:08,671
I tripped a beaner while I was
walking down the stairs...

972
00:57:08,713 --> 00:57:10,943
at the Wal-Mart the other day.

973
00:57:12,050 --> 00:57:13,813
Guy crashed into a bunch of wine bottles.

974
00:57:14,552 --> 00:57:16,679
They made him pay for 'em! Yeah!

975
00:57:19,424 --> 00:57:21,221
All right, all right, let's all calm down.

976
00:57:21,259 --> 00:57:24,285
White power here, white power here,
white power here.

977
00:57:25,263 --> 00:57:27,128
Giving him what he deserves.

978
00:57:27,165 --> 00:57:28,462
Hebe!

979
00:57:30,468 --> 00:57:32,959
All right, I'm back. Next.

980
00:57:33,004 --> 00:57:35,131
It better be good. Here.

981
00:57:39,277 --> 00:57:41,541
Come on, dude, say something.

982
00:57:43,948 --> 00:57:45,745
You know what?

983
00:57:47,419 --> 00:57:49,410
I did knee an Indian guy in the balls.

984
00:57:49,454 --> 00:57:50,478
That's funny!

985
00:57:52,157 --> 00:57:54,489
Yeah, send them Indians back to Africa.

986
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:58,655
Well, you want to hear something real
fucked-up and awesome that I did?

987
00:57:58,697 --> 00:58:03,430
I took a Korean guy's toothbrush
and I rubbed it all over my dick.

988
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:07,404
- You did that?
- Well, that's just downright disgustin'.

989
00:58:07,439 --> 00:58:09,202
- But I like it!
- Yeah!

990
00:58:10,375 --> 00:58:12,673
Yeah, I love bein' white.

991
00:58:13,912 --> 00:58:16,847
- What the...
- Look what we got us here, brothers.

992
00:58:20,218 --> 00:58:22,413
Mexicans!

993
00:58:22,454 --> 00:58:25,116
Lynch 'em!

994
00:58:25,156 --> 00:58:26,418
Come on, come on! Come on!

995
00:58:29,194 --> 00:58:32,357
Come on, boys, let's chase them
back to the border!

996
00:58:33,798 --> 00:58:34,787
Pussy fart!

997
00:58:37,602 --> 00:58:40,036
Holy shit!

998
00:58:40,071 --> 00:58:42,005
Should we put it out or what?

999
00:58:44,309 --> 00:58:46,174
Are they still behind us?

1000
00:58:46,211 --> 00:58:49,203
I don't think so.
Dude, the Klan is fucking slow.

1001
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:54,350
Hey, flag down this car.

1002
00:58:54,385 --> 00:58:57,081
Help! Help! Help!

1003
00:58:58,590 --> 00:59:00,956
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1004
00:59:03,561 --> 00:59:05,028
Thanks for stopping.

1005
00:59:06,097 --> 00:59:07,359
No problem.

1006
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:10,657
Neil?

1007
00:59:10,702 --> 00:59:13,227
Gary and Kumar!

1008
00:59:13,271 --> 00:59:14,329
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1009
00:59:14,372 --> 00:59:15,361
Harold. Harold.

1010
00:59:15,406 --> 00:59:16,896
Sorry, man. I forgot.

1011
00:59:19,110 --> 00:59:21,237
What are you doing here, man?

1012
00:59:21,279 --> 00:59:24,737
This is where God took me.
What are you guys doing out here?

1013
00:59:24,783 --> 00:59:27,274
We're actually trying to get to Texas.

1014
00:59:27,318 --> 00:59:28,683
That's where I'm headed!

1015
00:59:30,221 --> 00:59:31,210
What are the odds?

1016
00:59:32,123 --> 00:59:33,112
Let's get out of here.

1017
00:59:33,158 --> 00:59:34,716
- All right.
- Thank you.

1018
00:59:35,393 --> 00:59:36,382
Shrooms?

1019
00:59:36,427 --> 00:59:38,725
- No. Thanks, though.
- No, thank you.

1020
00:59:38,763 --> 00:59:40,594
Suit yourself.

1021
00:59:45,270 --> 00:59:47,295
Gentlemen, start your engines.

1022
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,438
It's gonna be a bumpy fuckin' ride.

1023
00:59:57,282 --> 00:59:59,750
We found their phone.

1024
01:00:00,618 --> 01:00:03,246
Lee and Patel made a phone call to you.

1025
01:00:05,123 --> 01:00:07,318
Now tell us everything you know
about their terrorist plot.

1026
01:00:07,358 --> 01:00:10,384
Terrorist plot? Rold and Kumar?

1027
01:00:10,428 --> 01:00:12,658
This is ridiculous.

1028
01:00:12,697 --> 01:00:15,257
OK, fine. Fine.

1029
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:17,860
Mr. Rosenberg.

1030
01:00:17,902 --> 01:00:20,735
Mr. Gold-stein.

1031
01:00:21,673 --> 01:00:23,766
We'll do it your way.

1032
01:00:27,612 --> 01:00:30,843
What's this? What do we have here?

1033
01:00:57,742 --> 01:00:59,437
It's about seven dollars?

1034
01:00:59,477 --> 01:01:01,138
Look, don't insult us, all right?

1035
01:01:01,179 --> 01:01:02,646
I don't know
what the hell is going on here...

1036
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,410
but I'm pleading the Fifth
until I speak to my lawyer.

1037
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:07,714
You're pleading the Fifth, huh?

1038
01:01:08,853 --> 01:01:10,821
Beecher, give me a copy
of the Bill of Rights.

1039
01:01:10,855 --> 01:01:12,379
The Bill of Rights? Why?

1040
01:01:12,423 --> 01:01:14,482
Just do it!

1041
01:01:14,525 --> 01:01:16,459
Excuse me.

1042
01:01:18,696 --> 01:01:19,685
Five, right?

1043
01:01:19,731 --> 01:01:21,028
- Five alive.
- Sure.

1044
01:01:21,065 --> 01:01:23,625
OK. OK. Good.

1045
01:01:26,037 --> 01:01:29,404
You wanna know what I think
about the Fifth Amendment?

1046
01:01:36,915 --> 01:01:38,348
There it is.

1047
01:01:45,023 --> 01:01:47,856
That's what I think
of the Fifth Amendment.

1048
01:01:50,795 --> 01:01:53,491
Why the hell is your ass so dirty?
Don't you wipe?

1049
01:01:53,531 --> 01:01:57,092
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to, buddy.

1050
01:01:57,135 --> 01:01:58,124
What do ya got?

1051
01:01:58,169 --> 01:02:01,229
Turns out the FBI was already
tapping Mr. Goldstein's phone.

1052
01:02:01,272 --> 01:02:03,035
- We got what we need.
- Wait a second.

1053
01:02:03,074 --> 01:02:05,406
You were tapping my phone?

1054
01:02:05,443 --> 01:02:06,432
You want to hear the tape?

1055
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:10,709
No. I'm sick of listening
to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?

1056
01:02:10,748 --> 01:02:13,216
Lee and Patel are on their way
to Texas as we speak.

1057
01:02:14,252 --> 01:02:15,412
I knew they'd trip up.

1058
01:02:15,453 --> 01:02:19,253
Ready the plane.
These fuckers are goin' down.

1059
01:02:26,297 --> 01:02:29,926
Neil, can you just focus on driving?
You've had... Focus on the road.

1060
01:02:29,968 --> 01:02:32,528
You've had dozens of shrooms,
my friend.

1061
01:02:33,204 --> 01:02:36,298
Dude, I was able to perform
an appendectomy at age 14.

1062
01:02:36,341 --> 01:02:39,504
I think I can handle
a couple mushrooms.

1063
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:43,071
- Wasn't that just a TV show?
- Jesus Christ!

1064
01:02:43,114 --> 01:02:45,912
Did you see that unicorn?

1065
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:47,713
Lts horn was so shiny.

1066
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:52,212
So, why are you guys headed to Texas?

1067
01:02:52,256 --> 01:02:55,157
Let's just say
my ex-girlfriend's getting married.

1068
01:02:58,396 --> 01:03:00,364
The one that got away, huh?

1069
01:03:00,398 --> 01:03:02,059
Yep.

1070
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,091
Sounds to me like you need a drink.

1071
01:03:04,936 --> 01:03:07,234
Road. Neil, please,
can you pay attention...

1072
01:03:07,271 --> 01:03:09,205
dude, I've got it!

1073
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:12,141
- Yeah, but...
- He's a good driver. Stop.

1074
01:03:12,176 --> 01:03:15,236
Thanks, man. Cheers, dude.

1075
01:03:15,279 --> 01:03:16,405
Really? Drinking?

1076
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:25,814
I have a lost-love story of my own.

1077
01:03:25,857 --> 01:03:26,846
Yeah?

1078
01:03:27,558 --> 01:03:29,822
Happened on the set of C/ara's Heart.

1079
01:03:29,861 --> 01:03:31,351
Sure, sure, yeah.

1080
01:03:31,396 --> 01:03:34,888
I'll never forget her.
Her name was Tashonda.

1081
01:03:34,932 --> 01:03:36,763
She was Whoopi Goldberg's stand-in.

1082
01:03:36,801 --> 01:03:40,794
Her skin was so soft,
her lips were so sweet.

1083
01:03:41,906 --> 01:03:46,809
She had these tiny,
little Hershey Kiss nipples...

1084
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:50,706
that you just wanted
to suck on all night long.

1085
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:54,480
Anyway, last day of shooting, I told her.

1086
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:56,282
I said...

1087
01:03:56,320 --> 01:04:00,051
"T-Bird, we're gonna have to break up."

1088
01:04:00,091 --> 01:04:01,683
Why did you do that?

1089
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:05,595
I didn't think I could take on
that kind of responsibility.

1090
01:04:07,198 --> 01:04:10,190
It was such a big mistake.

1091
01:04:10,234 --> 01:04:12,566
Why? I mean, with T-Bird gone...

1092
01:04:12,603 --> 01:04:14,935
couldn't you have sex
with whoever you wanted?

1093
01:04:14,972 --> 01:04:16,166
Let me be clear.

1094
01:04:16,207 --> 01:04:18,072
There is nothing on the planet...

1095
01:04:18,109 --> 01:04:20,407
that I love more than a hot, new pussy.

1096
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:21,969
- Sure.
- Nothing.

1097
01:04:22,013 --> 01:04:24,106
What does the P.H. Stands for in N.P. H?

1098
01:04:25,383 --> 01:04:26,475
Patrick Harris.

1099
01:04:26,517 --> 01:04:29,145
No, common mistake. Poon handler.

1100
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:31,715
The point is, boys...

1101
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:36,352
even though I love havin' sex
with some hot, random trim...

1102
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:41,354
a day hasn't gone by
where I haven't thought of Tashonda.

1103
01:04:42,233 --> 01:04:47,535
Every time I see a bag of
Hershey's Kisses, my balls get so wet.

1104
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:54,635
Here's to you, Tashonda.

1105
01:04:55,346 --> 01:04:58,975
- I hope you kept the baby.
- Wow.

1106
01:05:32,783 --> 01:05:34,944
Hey, honey.
What's up?

1107
01:05:34,986 --> 01:05:37,614
I found something in your purse.

1108
01:05:38,489 --> 01:05:39,956
Why would you go through my purse?

1109
01:05:39,991 --> 01:05:41,652
Why would you have a joint...

1110
01:05:41,692 --> 01:05:44,786
when you know
it could ruin my political career?

1111
01:05:44,829 --> 01:05:45,887
I'm sorry.

1112
01:05:45,930 --> 01:05:50,196
What with all the wedding plans,
I've just been a little stressed.

1113
01:05:50,234 --> 01:05:52,168
It helps me relax?

1114
01:05:52,203 --> 01:05:55,661
Marijuana is illegal, Vanessa.

1115
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:57,537
Now, I thought that part of your life
was in the past.

1116
01:05:57,575 --> 01:06:00,009
- It is.
- Good.

1117
01:06:01,379 --> 01:06:02,471
That's all I need to hear.

1118
01:06:05,116 --> 01:06:07,914
Hey, baby.

1119
01:06:07,952 --> 01:06:11,285
Look, I know things can be hectic
with the wedding.

1120
01:06:11,322 --> 01:06:15,691
But, you know, if you get stressed out,
just do what I do.

1121
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:17,751
Snort Zoloft, OK?

1122
01:06:25,369 --> 01:06:27,667
What the fuck?

1123
01:06:27,705 --> 01:06:28,694
Shit.

1124
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:32,197
Dude, they set up a fucking roadblock!
They're gonna find us.

1125
01:06:32,243 --> 01:06:34,040
- What are you talking about?
- Neil...

1126
01:06:34,078 --> 01:06:36,273
I don't know how to say this
any other way, man, but we're fugitives.

1127
01:06:36,314 --> 01:06:37,906
Cool.

1128
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:41,548
OK, well, we've got to find a way
to get out of this.

1129
01:06:41,586 --> 01:06:43,213
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Please.

1130
01:06:43,254 --> 01:06:47,156
You act like I've never smuggled
a fugitive across state lines before.

1131
01:06:47,191 --> 01:06:49,489
Here. Hide in that.

1132
01:06:49,527 --> 01:06:51,893
Sorry. It's a little sticky.

1133
01:06:54,298 --> 01:06:56,095
Shit.

1134
01:07:00,972 --> 01:07:02,462
Yeah.

1135
01:07:04,675 --> 01:07:06,836
What the... When were you
gonna show me these?

1136
01:07:15,086 --> 01:07:17,020
Excuse me.

1137
01:07:17,788 --> 01:07:18,948
Wait, Officer!

1138
01:07:19,890 --> 01:07:22,324
- Shit.
- Hold that car!

1139
01:07:36,274 --> 01:07:40,210
Neil Patrick Harris.

1140
01:07:41,512 --> 01:07:42,536
Yo.

1141
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:47,781
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

1142
01:07:47,818 --> 01:07:50,309
Yeah. I would imagine so.

1143
01:07:52,356 --> 01:07:54,290
I'm sure you get this all the time...

1144
01:07:54,325 --> 01:08:01,197
but your part in Starsh/p Troopers
truly, truly changed my life.

1145
01:08:01,232 --> 01:08:02,529
Really?

1146
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:04,363
How?

1147
01:08:04,402 --> 01:08:09,601
Well, no one thought the war against
the arachnids of Klendathu could be won.

1148
01:08:09,640 --> 01:08:11,073
- But you showed the starship troopers...
- Neil!

1149
01:08:11,108 --> 01:08:13,042
...that those bugs could be destroyed.

1150
01:08:14,812 --> 01:08:19,545
A lot of people think the war on terror
is a war that can't be won, right?

1151
01:08:20,851 --> 01:08:23,411
That's why I joined
the department of Homeland Security.

1152
01:08:23,454 --> 01:08:28,084
My friend, two words.
Starsh/p fuckin' Troopers.

1153
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:32,323
If you want to know the secret of being,
you will come with us.

1154
01:08:33,664 --> 01:08:35,689
Please. I really need to go.

1155
01:08:35,733 --> 01:08:39,601
Yeah, of course. I'm so sorry
to bother you. You move along.

1156
01:08:42,807 --> 01:08:44,775
Bye.

1157
01:08:45,409 --> 01:08:46,774
I love you.

1158
01:08:50,014 --> 01:08:51,845
I love you too, Mr. Patrick Harris.

1159
01:08:53,351 --> 01:08:54,511
What the...

1160
01:09:01,926 --> 01:09:03,689
Holy fucking shit, that was awesome.

1161
01:09:04,695 --> 01:09:06,788
Try having that conversation
on shrooms.

1162
01:09:06,831 --> 01:09:08,696
I deserve an Oscar
for that performance.

1163
01:09:08,733 --> 01:09:09,722
- You do!
- Dudes...

1164
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:11,632
I'm gonna take a little detour
on the way, all right?

1165
01:09:11,669 --> 01:09:12,658
- No.
- Neil, no.

1166
01:09:12,703 --> 01:09:13,692
But we're almost there, man.

1167
01:09:13,738 --> 01:09:15,865
- No buts. No buts!
- What do you do...

1168
01:09:15,906 --> 01:09:18,841
I'm going to a whorehouse
and I'm gonna get my fuck on.

1169
01:09:18,876 --> 01:09:23,404
If you two don't want to get
your dicks wet, that's fine with me.

1170
01:09:24,115 --> 01:09:26,242
I'll get my dick wet.

1171
01:09:47,638 --> 01:09:51,005
Pussy, I'm home!

1172
01:09:51,041 --> 01:09:52,508
Hello?

1173
01:09:53,310 --> 01:09:58,475
Well, well, well. I thought you'd never
show your face around here again.

1174
01:09:58,516 --> 01:10:01,280
What's the matter, Sally? I thought
I was one of your top customers.

1175
01:10:01,318 --> 01:10:04,412
Have you forgotten what happened
the last time you were here?

1176
01:10:05,222 --> 01:10:07,690
Because of you, my best girl quit.

1177
01:10:07,725 --> 01:10:09,522
Hey, I paid her good money.

1178
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,187
It's not my fault
she didn't lube up.

1179
01:10:11,762 --> 01:10:14,925
Besides, I bring you new customers.

1180
01:10:14,965 --> 01:10:18,093
- New customers?
- No, Neil, that's all.

1181
01:10:18,135 --> 01:10:20,160
Thank you. Thank you.
Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

1182
01:10:20,204 --> 01:10:22,434
Sally. Bring on the lineup.

1183
01:10:25,176 --> 01:10:27,167
Line up in the chutes, girls.

1184
01:10:27,211 --> 01:10:30,044
Longhorns coming through.

1185
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,172
Neil.

1186
01:10:35,119 --> 01:10:37,952
Bigger. Bigger. Bigger. Bigger.

1187
01:10:37,988 --> 01:10:39,853
Hello, ba...

1188
01:10:40,991 --> 01:10:43,755
- What's your name, miss?
- Tits Hemingway.

1189
01:10:43,794 --> 01:10:45,352
How'd you come up with that?

1190
01:10:45,396 --> 01:10:47,330
Well, I have huge tits.

1191
01:10:47,364 --> 01:10:49,764
And my favorite book
is A Moveab/e Feast.

1192
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,360
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

1193
01:10:52,403 --> 01:10:53,961
Well, I hope you're ready for me, Tits...

1194
01:10:54,004 --> 01:10:56,302
'cause I'm gonna rock out
with my cock out...

1195
01:10:56,340 --> 01:10:58,069
and you're gonna jam out
with your clam out.

1196
01:10:58,108 --> 01:10:59,803
It's gonna be magical.

1197
01:11:00,711 --> 01:11:02,645
- The whores are on me, fellas.
- No, Neil...

1198
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:04,477
- thank you, but we... that's...
- Thanks, dude.

1199
01:11:04,515 --> 01:11:06,005
Screw that, Roldy.
I don't know about you...

1200
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:09,417
but, no offense to the rest of you ladies,
I am gonna be taking you two.

1201
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:12,088
No, Kumar. Kumar!

1202
01:11:12,122 --> 01:11:13,612
Roldy, you're missing out, brother.

1203
01:11:14,525 --> 01:11:16,550
Yo, we need to get back on the road,
buddy.

1204
01:11:16,594 --> 01:11:18,027
We need...

1205
01:11:21,532 --> 01:11:24,467
Well, now, you know, we also supply...

1206
01:11:24,502 --> 01:11:28,131
in-room films or a magazine.

1207
01:11:30,140 --> 01:11:32,768
Well, if you'd like
some self-satisfaction...

1208
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:34,903
we do have some...

1209
01:11:36,647 --> 01:11:39,013
electronic devices right over there.

1210
01:11:42,453 --> 01:11:45,047
Just have some coffee. Yeah?

1211
01:11:45,089 --> 01:11:47,922
Why don't you lie on the bed?

1212
01:11:47,958 --> 01:11:50,449
And tell us what you want us to do.

1213
01:11:50,494 --> 01:11:52,860
OK. OK.

1214
01:11:54,198 --> 01:11:55,825
Well...

1215
01:11:57,368 --> 01:11:59,199
how about...

1216
01:12:00,204 --> 01:12:02,672
How about you take off your clothes
and make out with each other?

1217
01:12:02,706 --> 01:12:05,106
- We've done that before.
- We can do that.

1218
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:06,234
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1219
01:12:38,809 --> 01:12:40,606
Can you use tongue?

1220
01:12:46,183 --> 01:12:47,912
Bump your titty on her titty.

1221
01:12:52,523 --> 01:12:54,423
Boner achieved!

1222
01:12:55,459 --> 01:12:58,986
Great. Now let's get those pants off.

1223
01:12:59,029 --> 01:13:00,360
OK.

1224
01:13:00,898 --> 01:13:04,163
- You are benevolent human beings.
- Yeah, I know.

1225
01:13:04,201 --> 01:13:05,566
- Yeah?
- We get that a lot.

1226
01:13:05,669 --> 01:13:07,432
Yeah. You know what that means,
benevolent?

1227
01:13:07,471 --> 01:13:09,063
Yeah, I do, actually.

1228
01:13:09,106 --> 01:13:10,368
What?

1229
01:13:10,407 --> 01:13:12,568
It means we're gonna fuck you so hard...

1230
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:14,976
your dick's gonna be sore for two weeks.

1231
01:13:15,012 --> 01:13:18,140
That is exactly, exactly what it means.

1232
01:13:19,216 --> 01:13:22,117
You know what bothers me
the most, though?

1233
01:13:22,152 --> 01:13:25,280
He never once apologized
for getting me into all this trouble.

1234
01:13:25,322 --> 01:13:30,316
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my
Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?

1235
01:13:30,361 --> 01:13:33,797
But it's cool.
He doesn't know how to say "I'm sorry."

1236
01:13:34,231 --> 01:13:36,028
Why do you think that is?

1237
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:40,503
Sparkle, because it's all about
what he wants. It's about him, him, him.

1238
01:13:40,537 --> 01:13:43,734
You know. I don't even care
because... You know...

1239
01:13:43,774 --> 01:13:46,538
if he can't be a good friend to me,
I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.

1240
01:13:46,577 --> 01:13:48,738
- It's done.
- Don't say that.

1241
01:13:49,179 --> 01:13:51,147
A good friend is hard to come by.

1242
01:13:51,181 --> 01:13:52,614
Venus, come on.

1243
01:13:52,650 --> 01:13:55,881
Yeah, but if he was a real friend,
he would know how to say, "I'm sorry."

1244
01:13:55,953 --> 01:13:57,284
That's right.

1245
01:13:57,321 --> 01:13:59,312
Thank you, Agnes.

1246
01:14:00,224 --> 01:14:01,213
Nail on the head.

1247
01:14:02,092 --> 01:14:03,184
It's like right now...

1248
01:14:03,227 --> 01:14:08,164
after all the shit that we have
been through in the last few days...

1249
01:14:08,198 --> 01:14:13,397
you know, he's in there having
the time of his life, having sex.

1250
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:19,298
I never should have left her.

1251
01:14:19,877 --> 01:14:21,538
I don't even know...

1252
01:14:21,578 --> 01:14:23,978
I don't even know what I was thinking.

1253
01:14:24,014 --> 01:14:26,847
I loved her so much.

1254
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:29,079
She was my little baby.

1255
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:30,984
She was my little baby.

1256
01:14:31,021 --> 01:14:32,181
Why did I let my little baby go?

1257
01:14:32,222 --> 01:14:34,486
Why did I let her go?

1258
01:14:34,525 --> 01:14:36,425
You'll find someone else.

1259
01:14:36,460 --> 01:14:38,155
No, I won't. Not like Vanessa.

1260
01:14:38,195 --> 01:14:40,595
You'll find love again someday.

1261
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:42,861
Yeah, you will.

1262
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:45,765
Did you guys?

1263
01:14:47,337 --> 01:14:49,737
No, we're whores.

1264
01:14:49,773 --> 01:14:52,071
- Remember?
- Yeah.

1265
01:14:58,582 --> 01:14:59,913
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

1266
01:14:59,950 --> 01:15:01,747
What the hell is going on here?

1267
01:15:01,785 --> 01:15:04,686
That prick fucking branded me!

1268
01:15:05,589 --> 01:15:07,113
- Stop it.
- I warned you, Neil.

1269
01:15:07,157 --> 01:15:09,591
Bring it.

1270
01:15:09,626 --> 01:15:11,958
- Neil! Neil!
- Time to put your dick in the dirt.

1271
01:15:11,995 --> 01:15:14,395
- What... Neil! What are you doing?
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

1272
01:15:14,431 --> 01:15:15,420
- But...
- No, Neil.

1273
01:15:15,466 --> 01:15:16,933
Neil!

1274
01:15:17,835 --> 01:15:20,269
- What about Neil, man?
- No, fuck Neil. He just fucked us.

1275
01:15:20,304 --> 01:15:22,829
- Neil! Neil!
- Come on, come on, come on!

1276
01:15:22,873 --> 01:15:24,534
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Neil!

1277
01:15:24,575 --> 01:15:26,042
Come on!

1278
01:15:27,411 --> 01:15:28,935
- N.P. H!
- No!

1279
01:15:30,748 --> 01:15:31,976
Stop! Stop!

1280
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:34,845
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
We've got to get Neil.

1281
01:15:34,885 --> 01:15:36,546
- Why?
- Look, we're stealing his car!

1282
01:15:36,587 --> 01:15:39,454
- We can't leave him back there.
- He stole your fucking car last week!

1283
01:15:40,457 --> 01:15:42,118
What was that?

1284
01:15:42,793 --> 01:15:43,782
- Hurry up.
- Neil!

1285
01:15:43,827 --> 01:15:45,590
- Hurry up. Come on, man.
- Guys.

1286
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:47,563
- All right. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Neil, Neil, come on! Come on, man!

1287
01:15:47,598 --> 01:15:49,429
- Guys!
- Hurry up! Hurry up!

1288
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:50,933
It's not even funny.
Hurry up, dude, hurry up.

1289
01:15:50,968 --> 01:15:52,765
You can make it, dude.

1290
01:15:52,803 --> 01:15:56,261
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

1291
01:15:57,174 --> 01:16:00,143
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus Christ!

1292
01:16:00,177 --> 01:16:02,372
- Neil's dead! Neil's dead!
- No!

1293
01:16:03,046 --> 01:16:06,982
- Oh, my God!
- Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!

1294
01:16:15,793 --> 01:16:17,522
It's the dawn of a new day.

1295
01:16:20,364 --> 01:16:22,457
And Neil Patrick Harris
isn't around to see it, man.

1296
01:16:22,499 --> 01:16:23,488
Dude, I told you.

1297
01:16:23,534 --> 01:16:25,024
Will you please stop saying that?

1298
01:16:26,103 --> 01:16:27,593
God.

1299
01:16:27,638 --> 01:16:30,106
He's gone.

1300
01:16:30,774 --> 01:16:33,766
Maybe he's got
some family contact info in here.

1301
01:16:33,811 --> 01:16:36,006
Dude, I know
I'm not calling Neil's parents.

1302
01:16:36,847 --> 01:16:38,872
What's in the bag?

1303
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:41,441
- Holy fuck.
- Creepy mask.

1304
01:16:42,386 --> 01:16:44,980
A jar with hair in it.

1305
01:16:47,457 --> 01:16:50,517
And, like, 12 cans of Mace.

1306
01:16:53,197 --> 01:16:56,030
- Look, dude.
- Holy shit.

1307
01:16:56,066 --> 01:16:58,432
Holy shit, we actually made it.

1308
01:17:05,242 --> 01:17:07,472
This is where Colton grew up, huh?

1309
01:17:07,511 --> 01:17:09,809
Smell that? That smells like douche.

1310
01:17:16,053 --> 01:17:18,988
No, you will remain in this car.

1311
01:17:19,022 --> 01:17:22,253
I will go inside alone and, if we're lucky,
Colton will help us out.

1312
01:17:22,292 --> 01:17:26,194
- Why can't I just...
- No. Let me put it another way.

1313
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:29,961
You leave this car,
and our friendship is over.

1314
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,468
- But, Roldy, I just...
- Kumar.

1315
01:17:32,502 --> 01:17:35,494
Open the door
and I will cut your fucking balls off.

1316
01:17:35,539 --> 01:17:36,665
Jesus. OK.

1317
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,401
- Balls.
- Go.

1318
01:17:54,191 --> 01:17:56,716
Hi, I'm a friend of Colton's.

1319
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,284
Thank you.

1320
01:18:41,471 --> 01:18:42,768
God damn it.

1321
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:45,104
Vanessa? You OK?

1322
01:18:45,142 --> 01:18:48,475
- Kumar? What are you doing here?
- Yeah, let me help you up.

1323
01:18:52,316 --> 01:18:54,113
I thought you were going to Amsterdam.

1324
01:18:54,151 --> 01:18:56,813
Yeah, me too. It didn't work out.

1325
01:18:57,821 --> 01:18:59,083
You all right?

1326
01:18:59,122 --> 01:19:01,682
- Now, does this hurt when I touch it?
- Yeah.

1327
01:19:01,725 --> 01:19:03,317
- It does?
- Yeah.

1328
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:07,262
This is just what I need.
A limp during the wedding.

1329
01:19:07,297 --> 01:19:09,492
Can you move it around in a circle?

1330
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:13,697
OK, that's what I figured. It's just your
ATFL. I don't think you tore it, though.

1331
01:19:13,737 --> 01:19:17,298
So a little ice and massage
should do the trick. You'll be fine.

1332
01:19:17,341 --> 01:19:19,468
Are you gonna tell me why you're here?

1333
01:19:19,509 --> 01:19:21,500
Roldy and I ran into some trouble...

1334
01:19:21,545 --> 01:19:25,481
and we figured that maybe
your Colton could help us out.

1335
01:19:25,515 --> 01:19:28,678
- Still getting into trouble, huh?
- A little bit.

1336
01:19:28,719 --> 01:19:31,711
You remember that time that
you broke into the animal lab...

1337
01:19:31,755 --> 01:19:34,781
and, like, stole that monkey and put it
in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?

1338
01:19:34,825 --> 01:19:36,520
OK, first of all,
that was Goldstein's idea...

1339
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:37,549
and second of all...

1340
01:19:37,594 --> 01:19:40,290
had I known that the monkey had AldS,
I never would have done that.

1341
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:41,319
What about you?

1342
01:19:41,365 --> 01:19:44,801
You put those disgusting used tampons
in Professor Konop's purse.

1343
01:19:44,835 --> 01:19:46,393
- Remember that?
- Come on.

1344
01:19:46,436 --> 01:19:47,835
She was a bitch and you know it.

1345
01:19:51,675 --> 01:19:54,007
What's going on here?

1346
01:19:54,044 --> 01:19:57,036
Hey, she actually fell
and broke her heel here.

1347
01:19:57,080 --> 01:20:01,312
Yeah, I twisted my ankle.
Kumar was just looking at it.

1348
01:20:01,351 --> 01:20:03,410
- Why aren't you in the car, Kumar?
- Dude, I heard her yell.

1349
01:20:03,453 --> 01:20:05,045
I thought I told you
to stay in the car, man.

1350
01:20:05,722 --> 01:20:07,019
It's OK, man.

1351
01:20:07,057 --> 01:20:08,547
No worries.

1352
01:20:08,592 --> 01:20:11,186
Listen, Roldy filled me in
on the situation.

1353
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:13,992
But don't worry. I'll make sure
my dad takes care of everything.

1354
01:20:15,165 --> 01:20:16,154
Thanks, man.

1355
01:20:16,199 --> 01:20:19,191
In the meantime,
you are going to the doctor.

1356
01:20:19,236 --> 01:20:21,363
Ramon!

1357
01:20:21,405 --> 01:20:25,739
Ramon. Please bring Vanessa
to dr. Harris immediately.

1358
01:20:27,144 --> 01:20:30,204
Bye, Vanessa. Hope you feel better.

1359
01:20:31,381 --> 01:20:34,782
- Bye.
- Bye.

1360
01:20:36,987 --> 01:20:38,955
Guys.

1361
01:20:38,989 --> 01:20:40,422
All right.

1362
01:20:42,225 --> 01:20:45,717
All right, guys. Jet's all fueled.
You should be home in no time.

1363
01:20:45,762 --> 01:20:47,161
Sweet.

1364
01:20:53,503 --> 01:20:55,733
Hey, Colton, I can't believe
you're doing this for us...

1365
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:56,830
on the night before your wedding day.

1366
01:20:56,873 --> 01:21:00,502
- I really appreciate it. Thank you.
- Please don't mention it.

1367
01:21:00,544 --> 01:21:03,411
Just want to make sure
everything works out smoothly.

1368
01:21:03,447 --> 01:21:05,074
Are all these planes yours?

1369
01:21:05,115 --> 01:21:07,413
No. OK.

1370
01:21:07,451 --> 01:21:09,043
Rold, come on, of course they are.

1371
01:21:11,488 --> 01:21:12,580
This guy's funny. You're funny.

1372
01:21:12,622 --> 01:21:14,783
- Yeah?
- Hey, Colton, man.

1373
01:21:15,492 --> 01:21:19,087
Listen, I was wrong about you, dude.
You're not a douchebag.

1374
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:20,289
Dude.

1375
01:21:20,330 --> 01:21:21,957
You know what I mean.
I mean, you're a good dude.

1376
01:21:21,998 --> 01:21:24,159
And I'm happy for you and Vanessa.

1377
01:21:26,937 --> 01:21:28,734
That's big of you, Kumar.

1378
01:21:28,772 --> 01:21:30,637
- I really appreciate it.
- Sure.

1379
01:21:30,674 --> 01:21:32,835
I just can't wait to get back, man.

1380
01:21:35,212 --> 01:21:37,510
You're going back all right.

1381
01:21:38,215 --> 01:21:40,410
This time you're not escaping.

1382
01:21:40,450 --> 01:21:42,111
Now!

1383
01:21:42,152 --> 01:21:43,619
Go! Move, move, move!

1384
01:21:49,693 --> 01:21:50,751
You are a douchebag...

1385
01:21:50,794 --> 01:21:53,160
- No.
...you fucking douchebag, fuck you!

1386
01:21:53,196 --> 01:21:56,029
Yeah. The last thing I was letting
you guys do is ruin my wedding.

1387
01:21:56,066 --> 01:21:58,796
- You did this?
- Of course he did this.

1388
01:21:58,835 --> 01:22:01,269
I thought we were friends, man.
How could you betray me like this?

1389
01:22:01,304 --> 01:22:03,295
Come on, Rold. You and me?

1390
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,365
You let me cheat off you
in Advanced Accounting.

1391
01:22:05,408 --> 01:22:07,103
Other than that,
I could give a shit about you.

1392
01:22:07,144 --> 01:22:08,543
Take 'em away, guys.

1393
01:22:09,045 --> 01:22:11,479
When we get out of this I'm gonna
fucking kick your fucking ass, man!

1394
01:22:11,515 --> 01:22:13,176
Boy, you're scaring me.

1395
01:22:13,216 --> 01:22:15,411
Well, come on, you're not
one of those kung-fu Asians...

1396
01:22:15,452 --> 01:22:17,818
you're a fucking pussy banker,
for Christ's sakes.

1397
01:22:17,854 --> 01:22:19,947
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- I'm gonna rip you up, bitch!

1398
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:22,618
- You'd best watch your back, bitch!
- Fuck you, dude!

1399
01:22:22,659 --> 01:22:24,854
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1400
01:22:25,795 --> 01:22:27,956
I'm awesome.

1401
01:22:32,969 --> 01:22:35,870
Looks like you boys picked
the wrong side, huh?

1402
01:22:35,906 --> 01:22:38,340
Where's your Koran now?

1403
01:22:39,109 --> 01:22:40,940
We're not even Muslim, you moron...

1404
01:22:40,977 --> 01:22:44,208
and even if we were,
that doesn't make us terrorists.

1405
01:22:44,447 --> 01:22:46,847
Hey! I'm talking to you.
Get back here!

1406
01:22:56,259 --> 01:22:58,819
Man. I can't believe we're going back.

1407
01:22:58,862 --> 01:23:00,989
Now do you see
why I hate Colton Graham?

1408
01:23:01,031 --> 01:23:03,659
Now do you see why I hate you?

1409
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:07,125
I asked you specifically
to stay in the car.

1410
01:23:07,170 --> 01:23:09,832
I told you our friendship was at stake.

1411
01:23:09,873 --> 01:23:11,397
Vanessa fell down.
And I was helping her.

1412
01:23:11,441 --> 01:23:13,466
- I don't want to hear the excuses!
- It's not an excuse!

1413
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,738
I don't want to hear the excuses!

1414
01:23:14,778 --> 01:23:16,541
- I heard her yelling!
- I don't want to hear it.

1415
01:23:22,953 --> 01:23:24,716
I'm sorry.

1416
01:23:25,555 --> 01:23:26,852
'Kay?

1417
01:23:27,924 --> 01:23:29,357
Look at this. Look at this.

1418
01:23:30,393 --> 01:23:32,520
I fucked up, OK?

1419
01:23:32,562 --> 01:23:36,328
I fucked up and I always fuck up.
I am a fuck-up.

1420
01:23:36,366 --> 01:23:37,731
You think?

1421
01:23:38,735 --> 01:23:40,225
Harold...

1422
01:23:41,238 --> 01:23:42,535
you're my best friend, dude.

1423
01:23:43,907 --> 01:23:46,239
You mean the world to me, man.
I love you.

1424
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:47,265
Queers.

1425
01:23:47,310 --> 01:23:48,334
And I promise you, if we figure out...

1426
01:23:48,378 --> 01:23:50,642
a way to get out of this,
I'm gonna change, OK?

1427
01:23:50,680 --> 01:23:52,614
It's not just gonna be
about Kumar all the time.

1428
01:23:52,649 --> 01:23:55,447
It'll be about Kumar and Harold.

1429
01:23:58,255 --> 01:23:59,847
Harold and Kumar.

1430
01:24:01,625 --> 01:24:02,922
I kind of like the first way better.

1431
01:24:02,959 --> 01:24:05,325
OK, OK. Harold and Kumar.

1432
01:24:05,362 --> 01:24:06,886
Harold and Kumar.

1433
01:24:14,037 --> 01:24:15,766
It's not all your fault.

1434
01:24:16,773 --> 01:24:19,765
Yeah, it is. I brought weed on the plane.

1435
01:24:19,809 --> 01:24:22,937
- You got weed?
- No. The other plane.

1436
01:24:25,782 --> 01:24:29,980
No, I wish Neil Patrick Harris
were still alive, that guy fucking loves him.

1437
01:24:30,020 --> 01:24:32,784
He totally would have
been able to bail us out.

1438
01:24:34,124 --> 01:24:35,523
You just gave me an idea, man.

1439
01:24:36,760 --> 01:24:38,159
- What?
- I got this.

1440
01:24:40,096 --> 01:24:41,893
Hey, Burl...

1441
01:24:41,931 --> 01:24:44,957
- I actually still have some weed.
- You do?

1442
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:47,629
- Seriously?
- Yeah. It's in my pants.

1443
01:24:47,671 --> 01:24:49,696
- Hold up.
- You want to smoke now?

1444
01:24:49,739 --> 01:24:50,899
Just let me...

1445
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:52,168
- Harold, this is definitely not...
...get it.

1446
01:24:52,208 --> 01:24:53,197
...the time to smoke.

1447
01:25:16,399 --> 01:25:18,230
dude, you took Neil's Mace?

1448
01:25:18,268 --> 01:25:20,634
Been through a lot of shit,
figured we might need it.

1449
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:21,659
Well, good call.

1450
01:25:25,709 --> 01:25:28,143
Derek, can I get another water?

1451
01:25:28,178 --> 01:25:30,305
What the fuck?

1452
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:34,115
- Keep your hands up.
- Please don't shoot us.

1453
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,380
- Jesus Christ. OK, OK.
- Please don't shoot.

1454
01:25:36,419 --> 01:25:40,515
It will be a cold day in hell
before I let you hijack this plane.

1455
01:25:44,427 --> 01:25:46,395
Beecher, what are you doing?

1456
01:25:46,429 --> 01:25:49,023
Whose side are you on? I thought
I told you to stay in the cockpit!

1457
01:25:49,065 --> 01:25:51,863
Enough, Fox!
I've had enough of your crap!

1458
01:25:51,901 --> 01:25:53,425
You think that just because I'm smart...

1459
01:25:53,470 --> 01:25:56,906
you can treat me
like some dork in gym class?

1460
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,740
It's obvious these kids are innocent.
But you're too dumb to realize that.

1461
01:26:00,777 --> 01:26:03,541
You know, it's people like you...

1462
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,844
who make the world think
that Americans are stupid!

1463
01:26:05,882 --> 01:26:10,410
Well, we're not stupid! And we're not
gonna take this shit anymore!

1464
01:26:12,555 --> 01:26:14,580
It's OK, guys.

1465
01:26:14,624 --> 01:26:16,023
It's all over now.

1466
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:18,919
Everything's gonna be all right.

1467
01:26:23,733 --> 01:26:24,995
Jesus!

1468
01:26:29,973 --> 01:26:31,372
Fuck!

1469
01:26:32,442 --> 01:26:34,376
I don't wanna die!

1470
01:26:34,411 --> 01:26:35,605
Kumar!

1471
01:26:35,645 --> 01:26:38,273
- What?
- I have the parachute!

1472
01:26:38,314 --> 01:26:39,645
Come over here.

1473
01:26:39,682 --> 01:26:42,412
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

1474
01:26:42,452 --> 01:26:43,942
Swim!

1475
01:26:51,361 --> 01:26:52,828
Holy shit.

1476
01:26:52,862 --> 01:26:54,955
It's fucking working!

1477
01:26:59,636 --> 01:27:01,604
Yeah!

1478
01:27:02,939 --> 01:27:04,804
I love you, dude.

1479
01:27:08,878 --> 01:27:10,641
Shit!

1480
01:27:12,315 --> 01:27:14,749
Don't worry about him. I have an idea.

1481
01:27:14,784 --> 01:27:17,082
- What?
- Hang on.

1482
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,593
Fuck you!

1483
01:27:28,531 --> 01:27:31,329
Man, that was so fuckin' extreme.

1484
01:27:32,735 --> 01:27:34,930
It was.

1485
01:27:37,373 --> 01:27:39,068
- Kumar?
- Yeah.

1486
01:27:41,478 --> 01:27:43,275
Our dicks are touching, aren't they?

1487
01:27:44,781 --> 01:27:46,942
Yeah, I guess they are.

1488
01:27:46,983 --> 01:27:49,281
- Yeah.
- OK, I was just checking.

1489
01:27:50,420 --> 01:27:54,356
Roldy, can you move us out of the way?
There's a house coming up down here.

1490
01:27:55,492 --> 01:27:58,188
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1491
01:28:05,502 --> 01:28:06,662
Dude!

1492
01:28:09,439 --> 01:28:13,273
The glass hurt my dick.
The glass hurt my dick.

1493
01:28:15,345 --> 01:28:17,313
I think I'm OK. Yeah.

1494
01:28:18,381 --> 01:28:20,713
- Dude. Dude.
- Oh, my God.

1495
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,514
- No, shit, dude. You all right?
- Fuck! I think so!

1496
01:28:23,553 --> 01:28:25,817
We gotta get out of here before
the people who live here find us.

1497
01:28:25,855 --> 01:28:27,482
I know. They're gonna be...

1498
01:28:29,092 --> 01:28:31,185
dude? Dude?

1499
01:28:31,227 --> 01:28:32,558
What's up?

1500
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,727
- No.
- Holy shit!

1501
01:28:39,769 --> 01:28:42,704
What the hell are y'all
doing in my office?

1502
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:46,465
You'd better start giving me
some answers!

1503
01:28:46,509 --> 01:28:48,636
George?
We're gonna be late for that wedding.

1504
01:28:48,678 --> 01:28:52,045
Shit. It's Cheney. Come on, you guys.
Keep quiet. Follow me.

1505
01:28:52,081 --> 01:28:55,414
That guy scares the crap out of me.
Let's go hide in the guesthouse.

1506
01:28:55,451 --> 01:28:58,215
- Come the fuck on.
- I'm coming.

1507
01:29:18,608 --> 01:29:21,668
- This is a cool room.
- Yeah.

1508
01:29:21,711 --> 01:29:25,442
Yeah, this is where
I come to escape from work.

1509
01:29:25,481 --> 01:29:28,143
- Here?
- Yes, sir.

1510
01:29:29,619 --> 01:29:32,713
- So who the heck are you guys?
- All right.

1511
01:29:32,755 --> 01:29:34,450
My name is Harold Lee, sir...

1512
01:29:34,490 --> 01:29:36,082
and this is Kumar Patel.

1513
01:29:37,894 --> 01:29:42,092
Anyway, we were on a parachute
and we sort of landed on your ranch.

1514
01:29:42,131 --> 01:29:43,792
Dude, this is weed.

1515
01:29:44,701 --> 01:29:46,362
That's Alabama Kush.

1516
01:29:46,402 --> 01:29:47,664
That's only the finest.

1517
01:29:47,704 --> 01:29:50,400
So you get high and then you put
other people who smoke weed in jail?

1518
01:29:51,641 --> 01:29:52,938
- That's so hypocritical.
- Dude, look...

1519
01:29:52,976 --> 01:29:55,843
Yeah? Well, let me ask you
something, Kumar.

1520
01:29:55,878 --> 01:29:58,438
- You like giving hand jobs?
- No, sir.

1521
01:29:58,481 --> 01:30:01,177
- You like getting hand jobs?
- Yeah.

1522
01:30:01,217 --> 01:30:04,311
All right. Well, that makes you
a fucking hypocriticizer too.

1523
01:30:04,354 --> 01:30:07,687
So shut the fuck up
and smoke my weed.

1524
01:30:24,741 --> 01:30:25,730
Hey, love.

1525
01:30:25,775 --> 01:30:30,212
What are you doing here? It's bad luck.
The ceremony starts in a hour.

1526
01:30:30,246 --> 01:30:32,043
I just want to let you know...

1527
01:30:32,081 --> 01:30:34,174
I had catering get an extra case
of Coors Light...

1528
01:30:34,217 --> 01:30:35,206
in case the President comes.

1529
01:30:35,251 --> 01:30:36,582
It's his favorite beer.

1530
01:30:36,619 --> 01:30:39,554
- Do you think that'll be enough?
- I don't know. Yes?

1531
01:30:39,589 --> 01:30:41,318
Who cares?

1532
01:30:42,291 --> 01:30:46,352
Look, were you able to work
everything out with Kumar and Harold?

1533
01:30:46,396 --> 01:30:49,729
Don't worry, Chestnut.
I took complete care of 'em.

1534
01:30:58,007 --> 01:31:00,669
They thought you guys were terrorizers.

1535
01:31:01,244 --> 01:31:04,941
Wait. That's not funny, man.
They sent us to Guantanamo Bay.

1536
01:31:04,981 --> 01:31:07,711
Fuck! G. Bay?

1537
01:31:08,418 --> 01:31:10,477
Tell me you didn't eat
that cockmeat sandwich.

1538
01:31:11,721 --> 01:31:15,953
No. No, we did not eat the cockmeat
sandwich. We escaped, thank God.

1539
01:31:15,992 --> 01:31:19,393
That cockmeat sandwich.
That's my favorite.

1540
01:31:19,429 --> 01:31:20,623
Oh, my God.

1541
01:31:22,198 --> 01:31:24,860
- This is good shit.
- I know. I know.

1542
01:31:24,901 --> 01:31:26,869
- I laced it with blow.
- Fuck.

1543
01:31:26,903 --> 01:31:29,701
So it knocks you out, and it keeps you
going at the same time.

1544
01:31:31,240 --> 01:31:34,539
If you like weed so much,
why don't you just legalize it?

1545
01:31:34,577 --> 01:31:36,738
Are you fucking kidding me?

1546
01:31:36,779 --> 01:31:39,805
You know how pissed off
my dad would get if I did that?

1547
01:31:39,849 --> 01:31:42,113
Holy shit, dude.

1548
01:31:42,151 --> 01:31:44,449
My dad's all up in my shit too,
about this whole...

1549
01:31:44,487 --> 01:31:45,476
- med school thing, right?
- I know.

1550
01:31:45,521 --> 01:31:47,785
And it's not that I don't
want to be a doctor, but like...

1551
01:31:48,257 --> 01:31:51,385
fucking... sometimes I wonder
if he's just encouraging me...

1552
01:31:51,427 --> 01:31:52,917
because he knows it'll make me happy...

1553
01:31:52,962 --> 01:31:56,921
or because he wants me
to carry on his legacy, you know?

1554
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,059
You just blew my fuckin' mind.

1555
01:32:11,214 --> 01:32:13,808
- Hi.
- Hi. You look good.

1556
01:32:13,850 --> 01:32:15,841
Daddy.

1557
01:32:15,885 --> 01:32:17,512
Yeah, it's W.

1558
01:32:19,388 --> 01:32:21,822
I don't need your friends
to tell me what to do anymore.

1559
01:32:23,493 --> 01:32:26,155
- No, I'm not being disrespectful.
- That's what I say.

1560
01:32:26,195 --> 01:32:29,130
I'm just saying that
I can handle my own shit, all right?

1561
01:32:29,165 --> 01:32:32,100
I mean, I don't need them to tell me
how to do what I have to do.

1562
01:32:32,135 --> 01:32:34,000
Yeah, dude!

1563
01:32:34,036 --> 01:32:36,834
Yeah, well you know what?
Yeah, well, fuck you, dad.

1564
01:32:36,873 --> 01:32:38,966
Fuck you!

1565
01:32:41,711 --> 01:32:44,009
- Dude, that was awesome.
- You guys are awesome.

1566
01:32:44,046 --> 01:32:45,035
- No. No.
- You're awesome!

1567
01:32:45,081 --> 01:32:47,709
- You are awesomer.
- Sir, you are awesome.

1568
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:49,217
Seriously.

1569
01:32:49,252 --> 01:32:52,050
Listen, about our situation...

1570
01:32:52,088 --> 01:32:56,616
Fuck that. Listen, guys, guys, guys.
I am the fucking President, all right?

1571
01:32:56,659 --> 01:32:59,389
That means I get to pardon whoever
I want. You guys are in the fuckin' clear.

1572
01:32:59,428 --> 01:33:00,486
Don't worry.

1573
01:33:00,530 --> 01:33:04,660
- Holy shit. Are you serious? Thank you.
- Oh, my God. Thank you, Mr. President.

1574
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,724
Yeah.

1575
01:33:05,768 --> 01:33:09,033
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

1576
01:33:09,672 --> 01:33:13,836
But, listen, to be honest, after
all the shit that we've been through...

1577
01:33:13,876 --> 01:33:17,869
I don't know if we can trust
our government anymore.

1578
01:33:17,914 --> 01:33:19,973
- Trust the government?
- Yeah.

1579
01:33:20,016 --> 01:33:22,917
Heck. I'm in the government
and I don't even trust it.

1580
01:33:22,952 --> 01:33:27,355
You don't have to believe in your
government to be a good American.

1581
01:33:31,460 --> 01:33:33,724
You just have to believe in your country.

1582
01:33:34,497 --> 01:33:35,987
Exactly.

1583
01:33:36,032 --> 01:33:38,364
- Exactly.
- Right.

1584
01:33:38,401 --> 01:33:40,062
This is good shit, isn't it?

1585
01:33:41,737 --> 01:33:43,432
Yeah, it is.

1586
01:33:43,472 --> 01:33:46,999
If you guys need anything else,
just let me know, all right?

1587
01:33:47,043 --> 01:33:50,501
Actually, Mr. President,
there is one thing.

1588
01:33:52,548 --> 01:33:55,073
- This really came out great.
- Yeah, it did, man.

1589
01:33:55,117 --> 01:33:56,846
I lit a lot of these candles.

1590
01:34:10,299 --> 01:34:11,857
Great.

1591
01:34:14,170 --> 01:34:16,400
- All clear.
- Safe to proceed.

1592
01:34:17,773 --> 01:34:19,638
He's here! I knew he'd come.

1593
01:34:24,013 --> 01:34:25,446
All right, let 'em in.

1594
01:34:29,819 --> 01:34:31,480
- What is happen...
- Who is that?

1595
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,148
- Harold?
- Kumar?

1596
01:34:34,190 --> 01:34:38,422
Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize
for interrupting this beautiful ceremony.

1597
01:34:38,461 --> 01:34:40,190
But there is no way in hell...

1598
01:34:40,229 --> 01:34:43,130
that I'm letting the only woman
I've ever loved marry that piece of shit.

1599
01:34:44,934 --> 01:34:47,368
Security, get them out of here, please.

1600
01:34:47,403 --> 01:34:50,930
These guys?
No, see, they're with us. Yeah.

1601
01:34:50,973 --> 01:34:53,965
Looks like I got a little more pull
with the President than you, bitch.

1602
01:34:57,046 --> 01:35:00,140
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

1603
01:35:00,182 --> 01:35:02,776
Your fiance promised
to get us out of trouble.

1604
01:35:02,818 --> 01:35:06,618
But instead he arranged for us
to be sent back to Guantanamo Bay...

1605
01:35:06,656 --> 01:35:10,092
where we'd be forced
to suck Big Bob's fat dick.

1606
01:35:13,296 --> 01:35:15,423
- Is this true?
- Yeah, it's true.

1607
01:35:15,464 --> 01:35:17,193
I'll take care of this myself.

1608
01:35:19,669 --> 01:35:20,761
- OK, wait.
- No...

1609
01:35:23,172 --> 01:35:24,639
You son of a bitch.

1610
01:35:26,475 --> 01:35:27,999
I loved you, man.

1611
01:35:32,081 --> 01:35:34,641
- I can't believe this.
- Vanessa, let me explain...

1612
01:35:34,684 --> 01:35:36,584
Explain?

1613
01:35:36,619 --> 01:35:37,984
Explain why you're putting me through...

1614
01:35:38,020 --> 01:35:40,386
the most embarrassing moment
of my life?

1615
01:35:41,891 --> 01:35:46,988
Well, what if I did
something embarrassing to myself?

1616
01:35:47,029 --> 01:35:48,053
Would that make you feel better?

1617
01:35:48,097 --> 01:35:50,827
There's nothing you can do
that would be this embarrassing.

1618
01:35:55,371 --> 01:35:59,774
I fear that I will always be
A lonely number like root three

1619
01:36:03,112 --> 01:36:05,603
A three is all that's good and right

1620
01:36:05,648 --> 01:36:10,017
Why must my three keep out of sight
Beneath a vicious square-root sign?

1621
01:36:10,052 --> 01:36:11,747
I wish instead I were a nine

1622
01:36:11,787 --> 01:36:15,518
For nine could thwart this evil trick
With just some quick arithmetic

1623
01:36:16,759 --> 01:36:18,249
I know I'll never see the sun

1624
01:36:18,294 --> 01:36:20,194
As 1.7321

1625
01:36:20,229 --> 01:36:22,424
You fucking tool.

1626
01:36:22,465 --> 01:36:24,695
Quiet, anus.

1627
01:36:27,269 --> 01:36:31,262
Such is my reality
A sad irrationality

1628
01:36:31,307 --> 01:36:33,867
When, hark, just what is this I see?

1629
01:36:34,710 --> 01:36:36,701
Another square root of a three

1630
01:36:36,746 --> 01:36:39,340
Has quietly come waltzing by

1631
01:36:39,382 --> 01:36:41,111
Together now we multiply

1632
01:36:41,150 --> 01:36:43,675
To form a number we prefer

1633
01:36:43,719 --> 01:36:45,710
Rejoicing as an integer

1634
01:36:47,123 --> 01:36:49,057
We break free from our mortal bonds

1635
01:36:49,091 --> 01:36:50,956
And with a wave of magic wands

1636
01:36:50,993 --> 01:36:53,393
Our square-root signs become unglued

1637
01:36:53,429 --> 01:36:55,693
And love for me has been renewed

1638
01:37:04,807 --> 01:37:06,604
You were right.

1639
01:37:06,642 --> 01:37:09,440
- That was pretty lame.
- Told you.

1640
01:37:10,813 --> 01:37:15,580
Look, I can't promise you
the kind of lifestyle that Colton could.

1641
01:37:15,618 --> 01:37:18,416
And I can't promise you
that I'm gonna mature overnight.

1642
01:37:18,454 --> 01:37:20,888
But what I can promise you is that...

1643
01:37:27,263 --> 01:37:28,992
Sorry, I smoked weed
with the President.

1644
01:37:29,031 --> 01:37:30,862
I totally forgot
what I was going to say.

1645
01:37:33,369 --> 01:37:35,997
I can promise you
that I will always love you.

1646
01:37:36,038 --> 01:37:38,973
And I'll never try and make you
into something that you're not.

1647
01:37:40,309 --> 01:37:44,575
So, what do you say
you take a brother back?

1648
01:37:50,319 --> 01:37:52,378
Only if you promise to get me
out of this awkward situation...

1649
01:37:52,421 --> 01:37:53,445
as soon as possible.

1650
01:37:54,490 --> 01:37:55,582
Come here.

1651
01:37:59,028 --> 01:38:00,620
Yeah!

1652
01:38:05,067 --> 01:38:07,160
That's my boy!

1653
01:38:07,203 --> 01:38:08,431
Ku!

1654
01:38:14,743 --> 01:38:16,608
Come on.
Let's get the hell back to Jersey.

1655
01:38:16,645 --> 01:38:20,081
All right, hold on. First we gotta
do something for my buddy here.

1656
01:38:20,116 --> 01:38:22,016
- Got to go somewhere.
- Where?

1657
01:38:54,183 --> 01:38:55,810
- Hey.
- Hey.

1658
01:38:57,453 --> 01:38:59,353
- No luck, huh?
- No.

1659
01:39:01,223 --> 01:39:04,056
Called every hotel in the city.
I walked all around.

1660
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,159
I just can't find her anywhere.

1661
01:39:06,195 --> 01:39:07,662
- We'll find her.
- We'll find her, dude.

1662
01:39:12,835 --> 01:39:14,496
What?

1663
01:39:14,537 --> 01:39:16,664
Oh, my God, there she is.

1664
01:39:21,343 --> 01:39:23,709
- Roldy, she's hot.
- Dude, go get her!

1665
01:39:29,418 --> 01:39:32,478
Jesus, I'm sorry, man.

1666
01:39:32,521 --> 01:39:33,886
- So fuck it. Forget about that.
- Yeah.

1667
01:39:33,923 --> 01:39:35,447
It's probably
just some Amsterdam fling, all right?

1668
01:39:35,491 --> 01:39:36,549
We'll go back to the Jerz...

1669
01:39:36,592 --> 01:39:38,389
- in a couple of days, all right?
- No.

1670
01:39:39,662 --> 01:39:42,130
No, fuck it.

1671
01:39:42,164 --> 01:39:43,461
I came way too far.

1672
01:39:43,499 --> 01:39:45,091
We went through too much shit to...

1673
01:39:45,134 --> 01:39:46,567
I'm gonna talk to her.

1674
01:39:46,602 --> 01:39:47,694
No, no, no, dude, don't go in there.

1675
01:39:47,736 --> 01:39:48,862
- Come on.
- Just wait.

1676
01:39:48,904 --> 01:39:50,701
Come on, man.
Wait till we get back to Jersey.

1677
01:39:52,308 --> 01:39:53,434
What the fuck are you doing?

1678
01:39:53,475 --> 01:39:55,966
- C'est quo/ ton puta/n de prob/eme, to/?
- Harold!

1679
01:39:56,011 --> 01:39:57,876
I didn't understand what you said.

1680
01:39:57,913 --> 01:40:00,609
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing, man?

1681
01:40:00,649 --> 01:40:03,277
- You're ruining my shot.
- You what?

1682
01:40:03,319 --> 01:40:05,378
Get off my set!

1683
01:40:05,421 --> 01:40:07,321
I'm so confused. What's...

1684
01:40:07,356 --> 01:40:09,722
- What's going on?
- Harold, I'm doing a photo shoot.

1685
01:40:10,659 --> 01:40:12,251
For H/gh T/mes magazine.

1686
01:40:13,362 --> 01:40:17,059
Of course, you're a model.
You're very hot. You're a model.

1687
01:40:17,099 --> 01:40:19,294
Right. I always wondered
what you did for a living.

1688
01:40:19,335 --> 01:40:22,236
I'm sorry. So, wait a second.
So you're not with this dude?

1689
01:40:22,271 --> 01:40:24,034
Are you kidding? Me?

1690
01:40:24,073 --> 01:40:26,405
- Yeah.
- No.

1691
01:40:26,442 --> 01:40:28,808
Anton is like totally gay.

1692
01:40:34,683 --> 01:40:36,810
Harold, what are you doing here?

1693
01:40:37,953 --> 01:40:39,682
I didn't want to wait ten days
to see you...

1694
01:40:39,722 --> 01:40:42,247
so I thought
I would come and surprise you.

1695
01:40:43,859 --> 01:40:45,986
That is so sweet.

1696
01:40:46,028 --> 01:40:47,962
OK. It's sweet.

1697
01:40:47,997 --> 01:40:50,932
I've been thinking about you
this whole time.

1698
01:40:50,966 --> 01:40:52,456
- You have?
- I have.

1699

Fuck yeah, dude.

1701
01:41:11,553 --> 01:41:13,851
Bang bang, Roldy.

01:41:15,224 --> 01:41:17,351
Hello, Maria. My name is Kumar.

1706
01:41:22,398 --> 01:41:26,095
Ladies and Roldy, how would you
like to get really fucking high...

1707
01:41:26,135 --> 01:41:27,932
since we're in Amsterdam?

1708
01:41:27,970 --> 01:41:29,164
- Yeah.
- Shall we?

1709
01:41:29,204 --> 01:41:32,196
- Sounds like a plan.
- Let's do it.
