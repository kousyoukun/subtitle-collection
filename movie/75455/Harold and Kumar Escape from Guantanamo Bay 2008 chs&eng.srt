00:03:57,984 --> 00:03:58,973
什么?
What?

64
00:03:59,019 --> 00:03:59,999
这么追着玛利亚到阿姆斯特丹
Maria's gonna think I'm a staIker, man.

65
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,783
她会认为我是跟踪狂的
I'm foIIowing her to Amsterdam.

66
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:02,925
伙计 放轻松
Dude, reIax.

67
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:05,086
我还参加过医学院的十分钟采访呢
I have a med schooI interview in ten minutes.

68
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:06,888
你也没见我崩溃啊
You don't see me freaking out.

69
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,157
别担心了 她会很高兴见到你的
Don't worry, man, she'II be psyched to see you.

70
00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,822
高兴? 你觉得她会高兴吗?
Oh, psyched? You think she's gonna be psyched?

71
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,991

Totes, dude. Why wouIdn't she be?

72
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,367
那我们该怎么做?
So how does this work?

73
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,700
我们就…去阿姆斯特丹的各个旅馆
We justwe show up in Amsterdam and we start caIIing hoteIs...

74
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:19,637
然后挨个询问是否有叫玛利亚的房客?
and ask if they have a Maria staying there?

75
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:22,164
我连她姓什么都不知道      伙计 没事的
 I don't even know her Iast name.         Dude, it's totaIIy cooI.

76
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,039
我们一定会找到她的
We're definiteIy gonna find her.

77
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,874
阿姆斯特丹很小的 才不会…
Amsterdam is a very smaII pIace. It's not gonna be

78
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,676
先生 请到这边来 我需要对您做个检查
Sir, I need you to step aside, pIease. Let me search you.

79
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:30,512
警报响了吗?      不 没有
 Did I beep?         No, you didn't beep.

80
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,642
只是个随机的安全检查
Just a random security check.

81
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:34,153
到这边来好吗? 就是这儿
If you couId just step aside, pIease? Just over here.

82
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,678
随机的?      是的
 Random, huh?         Yeah.

83
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,351
也就是说 和我的种族无关?
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?

84
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,019
卡玛 照他说的做吧
Kumar, just do what the guy says.

85
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,222
先生 我们机场安检人员的工作
Sir, it's our job as airport security...

86
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:46,164
就是检查是否有武器或违禁药物
to search for aII possibIe weapons or iIIegaI drugs.

87
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,863
所以就因为我的肤色
So just because of the coIor of my skin

88
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:49,100
你怀疑我身上有违禁药物?
you assume that I have drugs on me?

89
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,727
不 他只是…      你算老几? 种族歧视者?
 No, he's         What are you, a racist?

90
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,898
种族歧视? 老兄 我是黑人
Racist? Dude, I'm bIack.

91
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,408
他是黑人 不是种族歧视者
He's bIack. He's not a racist.

92
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:59,104
拜托 伙计 你连棕色都算不上
PIease, dude, you're bareIy even brown.

93
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,010
不 他不是那个意思
No, he didn't mean that.

94
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:02,776
和我相比 你就是马修派瑞
Compared to me, you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.

95
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,784
你叫谁马修派瑞呢? 贱人
Hey, who you caIIing Matthew Perry, bitch?

96
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:07,787

I'm caIIing you Matthew Perry, you Matthew PerryIooking bitch!

97
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,812
不 这里没人是马修派瑞 没有!
No, there's nobody here who is Matthew Perry. No one!

98
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:11,380
这里出什么事了?
What is going on here?

99
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:14,916
长官 这位马修派瑞认为我身上有违禁药品
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks that I have iIIegaI narcotics on me...

100
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,360
就因为我是少数名族
because I'm a minority.

101
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,296
这是典型的种族歧视
This is textbook raciaI profiIing...

102
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,322
我打算上告到美国公民自由协会或者政府…
and I'd be more than happy to caII the ACLU or the government

103
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,835
不不不 很抱歉给您添麻烦了 先生
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

104
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,050
您可以走了
 You can move aIong.

105
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,736
很高兴听您这么说 再见 马修派瑞
I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt Perry.

106
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,435
嗨 你干嘛呢你?
Hey, what are you doing?

107
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,443
你这么问是什么意思? 他叫我马修派瑞
What do you mean, what am I doing? He caIIed me Matthew Perry.

108
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,774
你看上去确实挺像
WeII, you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.

109
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,642
他是白人!      那又如何?
 He's white!         So what?

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,012
你为什么总是要不依不饶呢?
Why does everything have to become a huge argument with you, man?

111
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:37,482
因为这是在美国 伙计
'Cause this is America, dude...

112
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,238
既然我有言论自由的权利
and as Iong as I have my freedom of speech,

113
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,247
那就没人能让我闭嘴
no one's gonna shut me up.

114
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:41,810
卡玛?
Kumar?

115
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:45,984
罗迪?

116
00:05:46,026 --> 00:05:49,086

168
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,756
他看上去就像个流氓
One who possesses the face of a date rapist.

169

Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip in GIacier Bay.

254
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,363
他不在的时候由我掌管
I'm in charge whiIe he's gone.

255
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,840
难道没有人通知他么?
WeII, shouIdn't he be aIerted?

256
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:55,178
难道这件事不比冰上垂钓更重要吗?
Isn't this issue of more importance than an ice fishing trip?

257
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,444
你算哪根葱?
Who are you again?

258
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:04,683
约翰比彻博士 国家安全局副主席
Dr. John Beecher, Vice Chairman of the NSA.

259
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:08,091
是么 听着 笨蛋博士
Yeah, weII, Iisten, Dr...Dipshit.

260
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
显然你从来没玩过冰上垂钓
You've obviousIy never been ice fishing before.

261
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:13,987
是的 我没有
 No, I haven't.

262
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,097
是的 所以你不知道这有多好玩
Yeah, weII, it's fucking exhiIarating.

263
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:20,833
而没人会希望在钓梭子鱼的时候被打扰
The Iast thing anyone wouId want whiIe fishing for pike is to be interrupted.

264
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:22,670
所以靠边站
Now back off...

265
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,042
我要开始做事了
and Iet me do my job.

266
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:40,448
那个眼神诡异的家伙是怎么了?
What's up with the guy with the weird eyes?

267
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:43,087
他是残废呢还是怎么了?
He handicapped or something?

268
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,120
我们觉得他有韩国血统
We beIieve he's of Korean descent.

269
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,599
上帝
My God.

270
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:55,730
北朝鲜和基地组织的合作
North Korea and aIQaeda workin' together.

271
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,538
比我想象中的更厉害
This is bigger than I thought.

272
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,078
你就不能等等吗?
You couIdn't wait?

273
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,808
就真那么急?
You couIdn't fucking wait?

274
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:05,510
我们将要去的阿姆斯特丹
We were about to have aII the IegaI weed we wanted.

275
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,816
你想要多少大麻就有多少!
You know, in Amsterdam, where we were going!

276
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,600
以为你们可以逍遥法外吗?
Thought you couId get away with this, huh?

277
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:39,643
911过后 你们都把国际安全当笑话了是吧?
You thought that after 9I11 our nationaI security was a joke, huh?

278
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,111
不过…
WeII...

279
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,217
你猜怎么着?
guess what?

280
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:48,455
怎么着?
What?

281
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,890
我们就知道你们这些混蛋会再来的
We knew you fuckers wouId be back.

282
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,092
见鬼了!      可是我们都是美国人 先生
 HoIy shit!         But we're Americans, man.

283
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,897
我们爱美国!      爱得死去活来
We Iove America!         Very much.

284
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,665
在你们试图炸毁一架坐满美国人的飞机之后
That's a convenient thing to say...

285
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,673
说起这些话来还真溜啊
after you try and bIow up a pIane fiIIed with Americans!

286
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:02,935

 No.         No, we didn't do

287
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,500
不 你们搞错了
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.

288
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,375
我的白痴朋友带了大麻
My idiot friend here brought marijuana...

289
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,903
上飞机      嗨嗨嗨嗨

290
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:13,009
闭嘴吧 凯蒂猫 我知道你们组织靠大麻维生
Zip it, HeIIo Kitty. OK? I know your operation's funded through drugs.

291
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:14,917
不 这是典型的官方调调 我…
No. This is typicaI government buIIshit, sir. I

294
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:25,089
我们可以用下电话么?
Do we have the right to make a phone caII?

295
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,892
是的 当然!
Yeah. Yeah!

296
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,300
抱歉 你们现在想要人权了
I'm sorry. You want rights now.

297
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,999
你们想要自由
You want freedoms right now.

298
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,905
现在什么时候了? 是自由时间了么?
Is it time? Is it freedom o'cIock?

299
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,438
你猜怎么着?      怎么着?
 Guess what.         What?

300
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:47,412
你们将要去的地方 没人听说过人权
Where you guys are going, they have never even heard of rights.

301
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,589
我们要去哪?
WeII, where are we going?

302
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:55,379
关塔那摩监狱 古巴 (美国关押政治犯的地方)

303
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:01,697
我们是无辜的! 我们是无辜的!

306
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:10,474
还给孩子买过玩具
And toys for tots.

307
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,874
现在却在关塔那摩监狱
And now I'm in Guantanamo Bay.

308
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,009
知道我为什么反对纳税了吧?

Look on the bright side. There's a sink. There's a toiIet.

00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:30,696
枕头看起来也很舒服
The piIIow actuaIIy Iooks pretty comfortabIe.

 No! Shut up!         OK.

317
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:43,706
你们怎么会被关进来的?

318
00:17:45,811 --> 00:17:51,044
为让美国人自食其果
For giving the United States a taste of their own medicine.

319
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:52,999
你们真的是恐怖分子?

有些人是这么称呼我们

321
00:17:56,188 --> 00:17:58,520
但另一部分人叫我们英雄
Others caII us heroes.

322
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:02,152
得了吧 杀害无辜群众也算是英雄?
Screw that. You think you guys are heroes for kiIIing innocent peopIe?

323
00:18:02,194 --> 00:18:04,321

It's 'cause of asshoIes Iike you that we're even in this fucking pIace...

324
00:18:04,363 --> 00:18:05,762
你们这群懦夫!

325
00:18:05,798 --> 00:18:08,631
也许如果你们的人不再吃甜甜圈
WeII, maybe if the peopIe in your country stopped eating donuts...

326
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:11,465
而去多想想你们的国家对世界做了什么
and started reaIizing what your government is doing to the worId...

327
00:18:11,504 --> 00:18:13,870
我们这样的混蛋就会消失了
asshoIes Iike us wouIdn't exist.

 Fuck you! Donuts are awesome!         They're deIicious.

 This is not good.         No, Kumar, it is not good.

 AII the guards in Guantanamo are gay?         Fuck, no!

363
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,004

你们才是吸我鸡鸡的同志!

要不踢我们屁股代替吧?
Why don't you just kick our ass instead?

ShouId we? What if they kiII us out there?

382
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:53,792

399
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:59,962

Watch out for cheetahs! This is cheetah turf.

400
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,566

 What?         OK. Fuck.

401
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:05,092
我们到海边了 现在怎么办?
We hit ocean. What do we do now?

402
00:22:06,405 --> 00:22:08,635
好吧

403
00:22:08,674 --> 00:22:10,164
嗨 看 看那儿!
Hey, Iook, Iook!

00:22:16,982 --> 00:22:18,609
你们这是去美国吗?
You guys going to America?

406
00:22:18,651 --> 00:22:19,879
是的
Si, vamos.

407
00:22:19,918 --> 00:22:21,818

408
00:22:21,854 --> 00:22:23,321

410
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,514
乔治 我跟你说
I'm teIIing you, Jorge...

411
00:22:25,557 --> 00:22:27,650
你到了美国第一件要做的事就是
the first thing you have to do when you get to America...

412
00:22:27,693 --> 00:22:30,594
买一台数字录像机 懂吗?
buy a device caIIed TiVo, OK?

413
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:32,995
如果你是个守法的公民 自由对你毫无意义
Freedom means nothing if you're a sIave to reguIar programming...

414
00:22:33,032 --> 00:22:34,465
我向你保证
I promise you that.

415
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,468
你现在在想什么呢?
And now, how about you focus?

416
00:22:36,502 --> 00:22:38,766
我们应该考虑下到了美国该怎么办?
We gotta figure out what to do when we get to the States.

417
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,637
没钱没证件 什么都没有
We don't have waIIets. We don't have any ID. We've got nothing.

418
00:22:41,674 --> 00:22:45,371
我认为我们该在迈阿密附近登陆 对吧?
WeII, I figure we're gonna Iand somewhere around Miami, right?

419
00:22:45,411 --> 00:22:47,572
那里是我们唯一知道有朋友住的地方
There's onIy one guy we know who Iives down there.

420
00:22:47,613 --> 00:22:50,047
你是说 罗扎      是的
 Who do we know thatRaza.         Yeah.

421
00:22:50,082 --> 00:22:52,175
我们得去找罗扎
We gotta go see Raza.

422
00:22:53,185 --> 00:22:54,982
再见      一路顺风
 AdIos.         Hasta Iuego.

423
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,955

 Thanks again.         What nice peopIe.

424
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:00,356
伙计 我们到南佛罗里达了
Man, South FIorida here we are.

425
00:23:00,392 --> 00:23:02,860
好吧 我们该怎么去找罗扎?
OK. So, now how do we get to Raza's?

426
00:23:02,895 --> 00:23:04,829
最直接的方法就是走 我们走
The professionaI way. We waIk. Let's go.

427
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:06,330

428
00:23:06,365 --> 00:23:08,356

So I guess Raza's

429
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,561
我们会找到的 会找到的      往那走

 Wow, Raza's pIace is pretty sweet.

438
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,050
有点迈阿密犹太人区的感觉
Kinda ghetto for Miami.

439
00:23:34,093 --> 00:23:35,424
你好      你好
 Hi.         Hey.

440
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:40,955
你们不是因为噪声来抗议的吧?
Y'aII aren't here to compIain about the noise, are you?

441
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:45,099
不 我们不是来抗议噪音的

 What is his name? We're here         Vagina.

445

 Very patriotic of you.         Thank you.

455
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,709
嗨 帅哥      嗨
 Hey, guys.         Hey.

456
00:24:26,912 --> 00:24:29,176
嗨 罗扎!      什么事?
 Hey, Raza!         What?

457
00:24:29,214 --> 00:24:30,442
什么风把你们吹来了?
What's up?

458
00:24:30,482 --> 00:24:31,813
卡玛和罗迪?      最近过得如何?
 Kumar and RoIdy?         What's up, man?

459
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,478
毕业后就再也没见过你们了
I haven't seen you guys since graduation.

460
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,078
你们怎么来这儿了?
What are you guys doing here?

461
00:24:36,121 --> 00:24:38,783
等等 这些橙色跳伞服是怎么回事?
Wait, what's up with the orange jumpsuits?

462
00:24:38,824 --> 00:24:40,291
嗨 不不 第一个问题是…
 Hey, no, no, question number one

463
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:41,986
这个派对是怎么一回事?      你指什么?
 ...what's up with this party?         What do you mean?

464
00:24:42,027 --> 00:24:44,495
裸露的阴道随处可见
There's exposed vagina aII over your house.

465
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,896
哦 那是我的主意
Yeah. That was my idea.

466
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:50,595
不知道你们如何 我痴迷于各种袒胸衣
I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of aII the hype over topIess.

467
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:53,036
真的? 我一直喜欢袒胸露乳
ReaIIy? I aIways Iiked topIessness. That's

468
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:54,060
这就是我      是么? 我现在尝试…
 That's just me.         Yeah? WeII, I'm starting...

469
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:57,701
露下体的 所以 这是场露下体派对
the bottomIess trend. Hence, the bottomIess party.

470
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:58,732
你们怎么会来南部海滩的?
So what are you guys doing in South Beach?

471
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,870
为什么不由你来问? 我正想知道
How about you answer that question? I'm gonna go check this out.

472
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,642
你们要去哪?      嗨 伙计
 Where are you going?         Bang bang, buddy.

473
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:05,013
听着 我们真的很抱歉来麻烦你
Listen. I'm reaIIy sorry to bother you with this.

474
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,711
你还好吧?      不好
 You aII right?         Not reaIIy.

475
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:12,821
他们被关进去还不到一个小时 就跑掉了?
They were Iocked up for Iess than an hour, and they aIready escaped?

476
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:15,691
见鬼 确保别走漏风声给媒体
Damn it. Make sure the press doesn't get wind of this.

477
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,695
不能让公众觉得我们很无能
Don't need the pubIic thinking we're some twobit operation.

478
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:18,718
明白 长官
Got it, sir.

479
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:20,629
应该不是基地组织或者北朝鲜干的
It must have been either aIQaeda or North Korea who broke 'em up.

480
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,258
严密监视他们之间是否有任何联系
Find out if they have any reIatives in the country.

481
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:25,327
你早该这么做了
You probabIy shouId have done that in the first pIace.

482
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,178
你对我的指挥有意见 比彻?
Do you have a probIem with the way I'm running the show, Beecher?

483
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,546
我只是说…
I'm just saying that...

484
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:41,417
我看过哈罗德李和卡玛派特的资料
I've Iooked through the fiIes on HaroId Lee and Kumar PateI.

485
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:43,011
他们都是在新泽西长大的
They were both born and raised in New Jersey.

486
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,886
除了偶尔的逃票记录 他们是清白的
Other than a coupIe of traffic tickets, they're cIean.

487
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:47,255
对 所以他们才会越狱
Right. That's why they just broke out of prison.

488
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:50,159
但是 他们是不是该被关押在那还是个问题
But theyIt's not even cIear that they shouId have been there in the first pIace.

489
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,186
闭嘴
Shut your

490
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,036
看见这个可爱的白人小女孩没 比彻?
You see this cute, IittIe white girI, Beecher?

491
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:02,404
是的
Yeah.

492
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:06,377
难道你希望她被强暴和谋杀么?
Do you want her to get raped and murdered?

493
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,768
当然不
Of course not.

494
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,544
你确定? 因为这就代表美国
You sure? 'Cause this is America.

495
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:15,814
你想强暴美国么?      不
 Do you want to rape America?         No.

496
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:19,290
那就别唧唧歪歪了
Then stop fucking with me.

497
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:24,662
这可是很严肃的事
This is serious.

498
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,597
她很可爱
She's adorabIe.

499
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,497
所以你们是逃出来的?
So you guys are fucking fugitives?

500
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,766
都是卡玛惹的事
It's just it's Kumar's fauIt.

501
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:35,705
如果我们能顺利逃走
If we get out of this...

502
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:39,108
我们继续做朋友的几率会相当…
the chances of us remaining friends is highIy...

503
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:40,338
相当…波霸 哇哦
highIyboobies. Yeah.

504
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:42,404
嗨 你在干嘛呢?
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

505
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,915
快把它穿上 扣紧了
Put that back on. And keep it on.

506
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,077
抱歉      你当这是什么派对了?
 Sorry.         Fuckin' party do you think this is?

507

你不是快结婚了么?

518
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:07,338
为什么就我被蒙在鼓里?

519
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:08,805
等等

But you don't want to bother them when they're doing their whoIe...

528
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,516

Hey, Jon, are you gonna Iet him do that?

你怎么就这么肯定啊 比彻?
Yeah, and how can you be so sure, Beecher?

'Cause he doesn't have a poIice record.

788
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,384
他是个牙医罢了
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.

789
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,238
那好吧 比彻

815
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,675

Nothing is more important than finding a way to get to Texas.

 Do you get it?         Yes.

We've been waIking an entire day and we have not seen a street sign.

00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:43,790
伙计们 我们先闪开一会
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.

892
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:47,525
别这样 别傻了 你们是我们的客人
Nonsense. Don't be siIIy. You're our guests.

893
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:50,033
你们得留下吃饭
You guys have got to stay for supper.

894
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:51,659
不 我们不行啊      不了 谢谢 真的不行
 No, we couIdn't. That's         No, thank you. We reaIIy couIdn't

895
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:56,105
当然 我们得先热热身
Of course, we're gonna have to get high first.

896
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,321
我们近了
We're cIose.

897
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:31,167
真是长见识了 我不知道农夫也吸烟
This is news to me. I never knew farmers smoked weed.

898
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:34,666
你一直以为我们不会这样? 那你就大错特错
You ever tried farmin' not high? It's borin' as shit.

899
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:36,703
这是很棒的事情
You know, this is great, guys.

900
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,840
我还以为
I kind of aIways, you know, sort of assumed...

901
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:42,250
南部的人民
that peopIe from the South were kinda

902
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,186
都是乡下人?
A bunch of dumb rednecks?

903
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,849
不      不不不 不是这样的
 No.         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not

904
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,566
客人来的时候 我们都把自己
We do try to keep our inbred son

905
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,827
近亲而生的儿子藏在地下室
in the basement when we have company.

906
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:53,193
伙计们 我不是这个意思 我只是
Guys, I didn't mean it Iike that. I was just

907
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,166
看他们那样儿!
Look at their faces!

908
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:05,497
妈的!
Fuck, fuck!

909
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,204
靠 他们找到我们了 他们找到我们了
Shit, they found us. They found us. They found us.

910
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:08,836
他们找到我们了 什么意思?
What do you mean, they found you?

911
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:10,870
你们惹什么麻烦了?
Are you boys in some kind of troubIe?

912
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:13,748
是的 这听起来很疯狂 但是…
AII right. This is gonna sound crazy, but, basicaIIy...

913
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:15,046
当时我们在去阿姆斯特丹的飞机上
we were on a pIane to Amsterdam...

914
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:16,425
我们被误认为是恐怖分子
and we got mistaken for terrorists

915
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:17,748
然后被带到了关塔那摩监狱
and we got sent to Guantanamo Bay...

916
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:19,915
然后我们逃了出来 随群古巴人偷渡到美国
and then we escaped and snuck into America with a bunch of Cubans...

917
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:20,981
我们现在正想去德克萨斯
and now we're trying to get to Texas...

918
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:22,014
那里有个人可以帮我们
where there's a guy who can heIp us out...

919
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:23,959
而那个人将要和卡玛的前女友结婚
and he's getting married to Kumar's exgirIfriend.

920
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:25,723
是这么回事
Yes.

921
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:29,293
好吧 真酷
OK. That's cooI.

922
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,767
我明白了      你确定
 I understand that.         You do?

923
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:36,034
就像之前政府对待我们那样 知道吗?
Like the government's never screwed us over before. You know what?

924
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:38,132
你们藏到地下室去 其他的交给我来处理
Y'aII come down here and hide in the basement. I wiII handIe this.

925
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:39,608
谢谢 谢谢你们两位
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.

926
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:41,611
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you, thank you.

927
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:53,923
这里一点都不阴森嘛
OK. This isn't creepy.

928
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:58,894
那是什么?
What the heII is that?

929
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:03,494
你要冲着那诡异音乐去了?
You're waIking towards the creepy music?

930
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:05,330
回…
Ge

931
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:06,927
这首歌真不错 伙计
This song rocks, dude.

932
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:14,700
卡玛
Kumar.

933
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,982
这里有个印着小丑的火柴盒
Hey, dude, there's a Iighter here with a cIown on it.

934
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:26,980
上帝 怪物!
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!

935
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:28,816
苍天啊!
God!

936
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:43,067
嗨 你身上有巧克力吗?
Hey, you don't happen to have a Baby Ruth on you, do you?

937
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:45,667
没有 你要这干嘛?
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?

938
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:48,644
这就是恰克赢斯洛斯的秘诀
That's how Chunk won over SIoth in The GoonIes.

939
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,613
这玩意看起来像斯洛斯?
This thing Iooks Iike SIoth?

940
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:52,809
我仿佛看到了动物的手
AII I saw was the creature's hand.

941
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,545
那手看起来像斯洛斯?
The hand Iooks Iike SIoth?

942
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:58,715
那是只怪物的手 就像只爪子
The fucking hand of an eviI monster, dude. Like fucking cIaws and shit.

943
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,553
我靠
Shit.

944
00:48:00,591 --> 00:48:02,425
听着 不管发生什么
Listen, no matter what

945
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,960
都别让那动物知道它很丑 如何?
don't Iet the creature know that it's ugIy, OK?

946
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:07,896
我们绝不能批判它  让它觉察出异常
The Iast thing that we want to do is criticize it or make it feeI different...

947
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:10,662
因为它生来就带着可怕的残疾
just because it was born with horribIe deformities.

948
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:24,443
别担心 我来处理 他们是我的邻居
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em. It was just my neighbors.

949
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,505
那里有个可怕的独眼巨人
 There's a fricking CycIops

950
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:27,608
在你的地下室      一个怪兽 伙计
 ...in your basement, man!         ...a fucking thing, dude!

951
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:28,845
你见到的是塞勒斯
You met Cyrus.

952
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:30,080
塞勒斯      你给它起的名字?
 Cyrus.         You named it?

953
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,348
他是我们的儿子
Our son.

954
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:32,050
一定是你们把他吵醒了
You must have woke him up.

955
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,323
他应该在睡觉了 不好意思
He was supposed to be asIeep. I'm sorry.

956
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:35,950
你说地下室藏着近亲而生的儿子的时候
I thought you were joking...

957
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:38,518
我以为是开玩笑的
when you said you had an inbred son who Iives in your basement.

958
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:40,189
哦 这不是说笑
WeII, it ain't a joke.

959
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:43,530
瑞蕾和我是近亲 不过我们还是结婚了
RayIene and I here are sibIings, and we get it on.

960
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:45,865
但这并不表示我们就是有罪的
But that don't mean we ought to be judged.

961
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:48,667
你们现在一定很累了吧
You boys must be awfuI tired after what you've been through.

962
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:50,139
跟我来吧 带你们去卧室
Come with me, I'II show you to your bed.

963
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:52,199
你继续睡吧 孩子!
You better go back to sIeep, boy!

964
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:55,235
别让我下来哄你睡觉
Don't make me come down there and whip your CycIops ass!

965
00:48:57,548 --> 00:48:59,209
棍棒底下出孝子
It's tough Iove.

966
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,241
这是最好的方式了
It's the best way.

967
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:22,096
我也不知道怎么会去和柯尔特约会的
I don't know what I was thinking dating that douchebag CoIton.

968
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,438
他是个流氓 你觉得呢?
He is a douchebag. What were you thinking?

969
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:29,173
和他做爱还得假装高潮真痛苦
But it was agony pretending his puny, IittIe penis satisfied me.

970
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:33,775
我打赌你一定想和我干了 对吧?
I bet. I bet you've been missing the thundercock too, haven't you, baby?

971
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:36,081
是的      真的?
 Yeah.         Yeah?

972
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,747
你很想我?
Yeah, you've been missing it?

973
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:38,914
有多想?
How much?

974
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,857
很想很想      我敢打赌
 A Iot.         I bet.

975
00:49:44,695 --> 00:49:48,324
我一直在幻想      什么?
 I kind of have this fantasy.         What is it?

976
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:52,426
如果这时候床上再多出一个人来该有多酷
I thought it'd be kinda cooI to bring somebody eIse in bed with us.

977
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:55,502
谁?
Who?

978
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,268
嗨 宝贝
Hey, baby.

979
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:05,209
哇哦!      如何?
 Yeah!         Yeah?

980
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:08,047
她够火辣的吧?
She's hot, right?

981
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:09,109

Why did we have to Ieave? Their GoonIes chiId was kind of cute.

Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!

1013
00:52:26,023 --> 00:52:28,321

It's your soIution to everything, you know that?

1014
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:31,327

先生们 开动你们的马达吧
GentIemen, start your engines.

1152
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:50,496
这将是颠簸崎岖的旅程

恐怖行动? 罗迪和卡玛?
Terrorist pIot? RoId and Kumar?

1158
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:12,717
荒唐
This is ridicuIous.

1159
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,316
好吧 好的 好的
OK, fine. Fine.

1163
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:30,902
这是什么? 我手里拿着什么?
What's this? What do we have here?

1164
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,496
这里有7美元?
It's about seven doIIars?

1165
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:01,197
别侮辱我们 好吗?
Look, don't insuIt us, aII right?

1166
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:02,704
我不知道这到底在搞什么名堂?
I don't know what the heII is going on here...

1167
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:05,469
但是我请求沉默的权利 直到我的律师来
but I'm pIeading the Fifth untiI I speak to my Iawyer.

1168
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:07,772
你要求沉默 哈?
You're pIeading the Fifth, huh?

1169
01:01:08,912 --> 01:01:10,880
比彻 给我一本人权法案
Beecher, give me a copy of the BiII of Rights.

1170
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:12,438
人权法案? 为什么
The BiII of Rights? Why?

1171
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:14,541
去干就是了!

1172
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,518
对不起
Excuse me.

1173
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:19,744
第五条 是吧?
Five, right?

1174
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:21,086
第五条万岁      当然
 Five aIive.         Sure.

好吧 好吧 好的
OK. OK. Good.

1176
01:01:26,096 --> 01:01:29,463
你想知道我怎么认为第五条修正案的吗?
You wanna know what I think about the Fifth Amendment?

1177
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:38,406
就是这样
There it is.

1178
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:47,914
我认为第五条修正案就是这样
That's what I think of the Fifth Amendment.

1179
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:53,550
为什么你屁股这么脏?你不擦吗?
Why the heII is your ass so dirty? Don't you wipe?

1180
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,151
别问问题 你不会想知道答案的
Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, buddy.

1181
01:01:57,193 --> 01:01:58,182

 We got what we need.         Wait a second.

1184
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,465
你窃听我的电话?
You were tapping my phone?

1185
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:06,491
你要听磁带吗?
You want to hear the tape?

1186
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:10,768
听这个脏农夫的话真恶心 结果如何?
No. I'm sick of Iistening to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?

1187
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:13,275
李和派特在去德克萨斯路上 正如我们所料

你吃了够多了 朋友
You've had dozens of shrooms, my friend.

1192
01:02:33,263 --> 01:02:36,357
哥们 我14岁就动了阑尾炎手术
Dude, I was abIe to perform an appendectomy at age 14.

1193
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:39,562

I think I can handIe a coupIe mushrooms.

 Wasn't that just a TV show?         Jesus Christ!

1195

当然当然
Sure, sure, yeah.

1211
01:03:31,454 --> 01:03:34,946
我永远忘不了她 她的名字是塔松达
I'II never forget her. Her name was Tashonda.

1212
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:36,822
她是伍匹格德布格的替身
She was Whoopi GoIdberg's standin.

1213
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:40,853
她的皮肤柔软 嘴唇真甜
Her skin was so soft, her Iips were so sweet.

1214
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:46,868
她的奶头就像好时巧克力一样...
She had these tiny, IittIe Hershey Kiss nippIes...

1215
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:50,765
你会整晚上都想吸着她
that you just wanted to suck on aII night Iong.

1216
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:54,539
不管怎么样 拍电影的最后一天 我跟她说
Anyway, Iast day of shooting, I toId her.

1217
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:56,340
我说...

1218
01:03:56,379 --> 01:04:00,110
"我们应该分手了"
''TBird, we're gonna have to break up.''

1219
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,742
你为什么那样做
Why did you do that?

1220
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:05,654
我认为我无法承担那样的责任
I didn't think I couId take on that kind of responsibiIity.

1221
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:10,249
真是个大错误
It was such a big mistake.

1222
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:12,625
为什么? 我是说 她走了以后
Why? I mean, with TBird gone...

1223
01:04:12,662 --> 01:04:14,994
你就不能和别的人上床了吗?

1224
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:16,225
让我说清楚点
Let me be cIear.

1225
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:18,131
这个星球上没有什么
There is nothing on the pIanet...

1226
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:20,466
比一个热情的新的女人更让我着迷了
that I Iove more than a hot, new pussy.

1227
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:22,027
当然      没有
 Sure.         Nothing.

1228
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:24,164
P.H.是什么意思?
What does the P.H. stands for in N.P.H.?

1229
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,533
帕迪克哈里斯

错 大众错误 是把妹高手
No, common mistake. Poon handIer.

1231
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:31,774
男孩们 关键是...
The point is, boys...

1232
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:36,410
虽然我喜欢和一些辣妹上床
even though I Iove havin' sex with some hot, random trim...

1233
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:41,412
但是没有哪一天我不在想念塔松达的
a day hasn't gone by where I haven't thought of Tashonda.

1234
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:47,594
每次我一看到好时巧克力 我的蛋蛋就湿了
Every time I see a bag of Hershey's Kisses, my baIIs get so wet.

1235
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,694
为了塔松达干杯
Here's to you, Tashonda.

1236
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:59,034
希望你没把孩子打掉      哇
 I hope you kept the baby.         Wow.

1237
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:28,095

~ 但自从遇见你 宝贝 ~
~ But since I met you, baby ~

1240
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:35,003
嘿 亲爱的 怎么了?
Hey, honey. What's up?

1241
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:37,672
我在你口袋里找到个东西
I found something in your purse.

1242
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:40,015
你干嘛翻我的袋子?
Why wouId you go through my purse?

1243
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:41,710
你怎么会有大麻
Why wouId you have a joint...

1244
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:44,845
你知道这会毁了我的政治生涯

1245
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:45,945
对不起
I'm sorry.

1246
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:50,255
因为结婚的那些事我有点压力
What with aII the wedding pIans, I've just been a IittIe stressed.

1247
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,227
它能让我放松放松
It heIps me reIax?

1248
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:55,720
大麻是违法的 温妮莎
Marijuana is iIIegaI, Vanessa.

1249
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:57,596
我以为你生活中的那段时间已经是过去式了
Now, I thought that part of your Iife was in the past.

1250
01:05:57,634 --> 01:06:00,068
是的      好的
 It is.         Good.

1251
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:02,529

That's aII I need to hear.

1252
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,972
嘿 宝贝

1253
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:11,344
我知道因为结婚会紧张兴奋
Look, I know things can be hectic with the wedding.

1254
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:15,750
但是你知道如果你压力太大 就像我一样
But, you know, if you get stressed out, just do what I do.

1255
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:17,810
吃抗抑郁药 好吗?
Snort ZoIoft, OK?

1256
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:27,726
搞毛啊

1257
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:28,753
操
Shit.

1258

Dude, they set up a fucking roadbIock! They're gonna find us.

1259
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:34,099

 What are you taIking about?         NeiI...

I don't know how to say this any other way, man, but we're fugitives.

1261
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:37,964

好的 我们得整个法子逃走
OK, weII, we've got to find a way to get out of this.

1263

 Yeah, yeah, yeah.         PIease.

You act Iike I've never smuggIed a fugitive across state Iines before.

1265
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,548
给 藏这
Here. Hide in that.

1266
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,951
不好意思 有点粘
Sorry. It's a IittIe sticky.

I'm sure you get this aII the time...

1278
01:07:54,384 --> 01:08:01,256
但你在星河战队的演出真的改变了我的生活

1279
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,587

ReaIIy?

1280
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:04,422
怎么改变了?
How?

1281
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:09,659
没人想到对虫族的战争会赢
WeII, no one thought the war against the arachnids of KIendathu couId be won.

1282
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:11,132
但是你展示了星河战队…      尼奥
 But you showed the starship troopers         NeiI!

1283

可以摧毁那些臭虫们
...that those bugs couId be destroyed.

1284
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:19,604
很多人认为那个反恐战争是不能赢的 是吧?
A Iot of peopIe think the war on terror is a war that can't be won, right?

1285
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:23,470
这就是我加入国家安全局的原因
That's why I joined the Department of HomeIand Security.

1286
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:28,143

HoIy fucking shit, that was awesome.

1295
01:09:04,754 --> 01:09:06,847
你们试试看吃了迷幻药还有那样的对话
Try having that conversation on shrooms.

1296
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:08,754
奥斯卡应该给我刚才的表现颁奖
I deserve an Oscar for that performance.

1297
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:09,780
应该的      兄弟们
 You do!         Dudes...

I'm gonna take a IittIe detour on the way, aII right?

1299
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:12,716
不行      尼奥 别啊

But we're aImost there, man.

I'm going to a whorehouse and I'm gonna get my fuck on.

1303
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:23,463
你们不想动鸡巴的话 没事啊
If you two don't want to get your dicks wet, that's fine with me.

1304
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:26,300
我要去活动活动我的小弟弟
I'II get my dick wet.

1305
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:36,681
~ 什么都不需要 只要一段好时光 ~

好的
OK.

1382
01:13:00,956 --> 01:13:04,221
你们真是善良的人      是的 我们知道
 You are benevoIent human beings.         Yeah, I know.

1383
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:05,625
是吗      很多人这么说
 Yeah?         We get that a Iot.

1384
01:13:05,728 --> 01:13:07,491
你知道我说的"善良"是什么意思?
Yeah. You know what that means, benevoIent?

1385
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:09,122
是的 我知道
Yeah, I do, actuaIIy.

1386
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:10,427
什么意思?
What?

1387
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:12,627
它的意思是我们会把你操倒
It means we're gonna fuck you so hard...

1388
01:13:12,668 --> 01:13:15,034
你的小弟弟要酸痛两个星期
your dick's gonna be sore for two weeks.

1389
01:13:15,071 --> 01:13:18,199
我就是这个意思
That is exactIy, exactIy what it means.

1390
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:22,176
你知道 我最头痛什么吗?
You know what bothers me the most, though?

1391
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:25,339
他从来没为把我卷进这件事道过歉
He never once apoIogized for getting me into aII this troubIe.

1392
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:30,375
我现在本该和我的玛利亚在阿姆斯特丹
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?

1393
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:33,855
算了 他不知道怎么说"对不起"
But it's cooI. He doesn't know how to say ''I'm sorry.''

1394
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,087
为什么他不会说?
Why do you think that is?

1395
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:40,562
因为他只知道他想要的 他他还是他
SparkIe, because it's aII about what he wants. It's about him, him, him.

1396
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:43,793
其实 我不在意 因为 你知道...
You know. I don't even care becauseYou know

1397
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,597
如果他不把我当好朋友 我也不会
if he can't be a good friend to me, I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.

1398
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:48,796
就这样      别这么说 
 It's done.         Don't say that.

1399
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:51,206
一个好朋友是很难得的
A good friend is hard to come by.

1400
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,673
维纳斯 拜托
Venus, come on.

1401
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:55,939
但如果他真的是个好朋友 他会知道道歉
Yeah, but if he was a reaI friend, he wouId know how to say, ''I'm sorry.''

1402
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:57,342
对啊
That's right.

1403
01:13:57,379 --> 01:13:59,370
谢谢 阿柯斯
Thank you, Agnes.

1404
01:14:00,282 --> 01:14:01,271
一语中的
NaiI on the head.

1405
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:03,243
就像现在
It's Iike right now...

在经历这些天的衰事后
after aII the shit that we have been through in the Iast few days...

1407
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:13,456

1410
01:14:21,637 --> 01:14:24,037
我甚至不知道那时候我想些什么

1411

我那么爱她

她是我的小宝贝

Your fiance promised to get us out of troubIe.

1782
01:35:02,877 --> 01:35:06,677
但是却设计把我们送回监狱
But instead he arranged for us to be sent back to Guantanamo Bay...

1783
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:10,150
那里我们得给那的肥猪吹箫
where we'd be forced to suck Big Bob's fat dick.

1784
01:35:13,354 --> 01:35:15,481
真的是这样      是真的
 Is this true?         Yeah, it's true.

1785
01:35:15,523 --> 01:35:17,252
我自己来搞定
I'II take care of this myseIf.

1786
01:35:19,727 --> 01:35:20,819
等一下      不
 OK, wait.         No

1787
01:35:23,231 --> 01:35:24,698
狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

1788
01:35:26,534 --> 01:35:28,058
我喜欢过你的 伙计
I Ioved you, man.

1789
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,700
难以置信      温妮莎 听我解释
 I can't beIieve this.         Vanessa, Iet me expIain

1790
01:35:34,742 --> 01:35:36,642
解释?
ExpIain?

1791
01:35:36,677 --> 01:35:38,042
解释为什么你让我经历
ExpIain why you're putting me through...

1792
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,445
人生中最尴尬的一刻
the most embarrassing moment of my Iife?

1793
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:47,046
那 如果我做让自己尴尬的事呢
WeII, what if I did something embarrassing to myseIf?

1794
01:35:47,088 --> 01:35:48,112
你会不会感觉好点?
WouId that make you feeI better?

1795
01:35:48,156 --> 01:35:50,886
没有什么事比这更尴尬了
There's nothing you can do that wouId be this embarrassing.

1796
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:59,833
我害怕我会永远是一个孤独的3的平方根
I fear that I wiII aIways be A IoneIy number Iike root three

1797
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:05,662
3就是好的和对的
A three is aII that's good and right

1798
01:36:05,706 --> 01:36:10,075
为什么在邪恶的平方号下总看不见我的3?  
Why must my three keep out of sight Beneath a vicious squareroot sign?

1799
01:36:10,111 --> 01:36:11,806
我希望我是9
I wish instead I were a nine

1800
01:36:11,846 --> 01:36:15,577
因为算术能让9跨越这邪恶的玩笑
For nine couId thwart this eviI trick With just some quick arithmetic

1801
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:18,308
我知道我永远看不到太阳
I know I'II never see the sun

1802
01:36:18,352 --> 01:36:20,252
就象1.7321
As 1.7321

1803
01:36:20,288 --> 01:36:22,483
牛逼数学脑
You fucking tooI.

1804
01:36:22,523 --> 01:36:24,753
安静 傻瓜
Quiet, anus.

1805
01:36:27,328 --> 01:36:31,321
这就是我的现状 一个可悲的失去理性的人
Such is my reaIity A sad irrationaIity

1806
01:36:31,365 --> 01:36:33,925
听 这就是我看到的吗?
When, hark, just what is this I see?

1807
01:36:34,769 --> 01:36:36,760
另一个3的平方根
Another square root of a three

1808
01:36:36,804 --> 01:36:39,398
悄悄的跳着华尔兹舞来了
Has quietIy come waItzing by

1809
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,169
把我们乘起来
Together now we muItipIy

1810
01:36:41,209 --> 01:36:43,734
变成我们都向往的数字
To form a number we prefer

1811
01:36:43,778 --> 01:36:45,769
为成为一个整数而开心
Rejoicing as an integer

1812
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:49,115
我们从肉身中获得自由
We break free from our mortaI bonds

1813
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:51,015
随着魔力棒的一挥
And with a wave of magic wands

1814
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:53,452
我们的根号拆开了
Our squareroot signs become ungIued

1815
01:36:53,488 --> 01:36:55,752
爱对我来说好像新的一样
And Iove for me has been renewed

1816
01:37:04,866 --> 01:37:06,663
你是对的
You were right.

1817
01:37:06,701 --> 01:37:09,499
我和他的爱站不住脚的      跟你说过的
 That was pretty Iame.         ToId you.

1818
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:15,639
我无法承诺你象柯尔特那样的生活
Look, I can't promise you the kind of IifestyIe that CoIton couId.

1819
01:37:15,676 --> 01:37:18,474
我也无法承诺你我会一夜之间长大成熟
And I can't promise you that I'm gonna mature overnight.

1820
01:37:18,513 --> 01:37:20,947
但是我能承诺
But what I can promise you is that

1821
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:29,050
对不起 刚和总统抽大麻来着
Sorry, I smoked weed with the President.

1822
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,921
我忘了我要说什么了
I totaIIy forgot what I was going to say.

1823
01:37:33,427 --> 01:37:36,055
我能承诺你我会爱你一辈子
I can promise you that I wiII aIways Iove you.

1824
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:39,032
我不会逼你做你不想做的事
And I'II never try and make you into something that you're not.

1825
01:37:40,368 --> 01:37:44,634
那你能重新接受我吗?
So, what do you say you take a brother back?

1826
01:37:50,378 --> 01:37:52,437
只要你答应化解这尴尬的情况 
OnIy if you promise to get me out of this awkward situation...

1827
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,504
越快越好
as soon as possibIe.

1828
01:37:54,549 --> 01:37:55,641

 No Iuck, huh?         No.

1842

CaIIed every hoteI in the city. I waIked aII around.

1843

我哪都找不到她
I just can't find her anywhere.

1844
01:39:06,254 --> 01:39:07,721
我们会找到的      我们会找到她的 兄弟
 We'II find her.         We'II find her, dude.

1845
