64
00:03:59,019 --> 00:03:59,999
Maria's gonna think I'm a staIker, man.

65
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,783
I'm foIIowing her to Amsterdam.

66
00:04:01,821 --> 00:04:02,925
Dude, reIax.

67

I have a med schooI interview in ten minutes.

You don't see me freaking out.

00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:09,157
Don't worry, man, she'II be psyched to see you.

00:04:09,195 --> 00:04:10,822
Oh, psyched? You think she's gonna be psyched?

71
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,991
Totes, dude. Why wouIdn't she be?

72
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:14,367
So how does this work?

73
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:17,700
We justwe show up in Amsterdam and we start caIIing hoteIs...

74
00:04:17,737 --> 00:04:19,637
and ask if they have a Maria staying there?

75
00:04:19,673 --> 00:04:22,164
 I don't even know her Iast name.         Dude, it's totaIIy cooI.

76
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,039
We're definiteIy gonna find her.

77
00:04:24,077 --> 00:04:25,874
Amsterdam is a very smaII pIace. It's not gonna be

78
00:04:25,912 --> 00:04:28,676
Sir, I need you to step aside, pIease. Let me search you.

79
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:30,512
 Did I beep?         No, you didn't beep.

80
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,642
Just a random security check.

81
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:34,153
If you couId just step aside, pIease? Just over here.

82
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:36,678
 Random, huh?         Yeah.

83
00:04:36,723 --> 00:04:39,351
So this has nothing to do with my ethnicity?

84
00:04:39,392 --> 00:04:41,019
Kumar, just do what the guy says.

85
00:04:41,061 --> 00:04:43,222
Sir, it's our job as airport security...

86
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:46,164
to search for aII possibIe weapons or iIIegaI drugs.

87
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:47,863
So just because of the coIor of my skin

88
00:04:47,863 --> 00:04:49,100
you assume that I have drugs on me?

89
00:04:49,135 --> 00:04:50,727
 No, he's         What are you, a racist?

90
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,898
Racist? Dude, I'm bIack.

91
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,408
He's bIack. He's not a racist.

92
00:04:56,943 --> 00:04:59,104
PIease, dude, you're bareIy even brown.

93
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:01,010
No, he didn't mean that.

94
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:02,776
Compared to me, you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.

95
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:04,784
Hey, who you caIIing Matthew Perry, bitch?

96
00:05:04,818 --> 00:05:07,787
I'm caIIing you Matthew Perry, you Matthew PerryIooking bitch!

97
00:05:07,821 --> 00:05:09,812
No, there's nobody here who is Matthew Perry. No one!

98
00:05:09,856 --> 00:05:11,380
What is going on here?

99
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:14,916
Sir, Matthew Perry over here thinks that I have iIIegaI narcotics on me...

100
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:16,360
because I'm a minority.

101
00:05:16,396 --> 00:05:18,296
This is textbook raciaI profiIing...

102
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,322
and I'd be more than happy to caII the ACLU or the government

103
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,835
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.

104
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:24,050
 You can move aIong.

105
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,736
I appreciate it. Thanks, Matt Perry.

106
00:05:27,173 --> 00:05:28,435
Hey, what are you doing?

107
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,443
What do you mean, what am I doing? He caIIed me Matthew Perry.

108
00:05:30,477 --> 00:05:31,774
WeII, you Iook Iike Matthew Perry.

109
00:05:31,811 --> 00:05:33,642
 He's white!         So what?

110
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,012
Why does everything have to become a huge argument with you, man?

111
00:05:36,049 --> 00:05:37,482
'Cause this is America, dude...

112
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:39,238
and as Iong as I have my freedom of speech,

113
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,247
no one's gonna shut me up.

114
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:41,810
Kumar?

115
00:05:44,824 --> 00:05:45,984

164
00:07:57,056 --> 00:07:58,523
Dude, I can't beIieve they're getting married.

165
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:00,549
We've onIy been broken up two years.

166
00:08:01,227 --> 00:08:03,092
PIus that dude has daterape face.

167
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:05,222
I don't even know what that is.

168
00:08:05,265 --> 00:08:07,756
One who possesses the face of a date rapist.

169
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:11,100
Right. Listen...

170
00:08:11,137 --> 00:08:13,605
I'm sorry, bro.

171
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,268
But we are going to Amsterdam. Come on.

172
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:19,472
This is true. This is true, RoIdy.

173
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:21,639

174
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:28,618
 Man, this is so not Iike me.         Yeah.

175
00:08:28,655 --> 00:08:32,147
It's Iike I'm a whoIe new HaroId. Better, faster, stronger.

176
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:33,853
Nice.

177
00:08:33,893 --> 00:08:34,951
Man, I've never used a sick day before.

178
00:08:34,994 --> 00:08:38,191
I'm taking a whoIe week off from work here, man.

179
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:41,997
And in Iess than eight hours, we're gonna be in Amsterdam.

180
00:08:42,035 --> 00:08:44,526
 This is nuts. This is nuts.         I know, dude.

181
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:46,562
It's gonna be exactIy Iike Euro TrIp, onIy it's not gonna suck.

182
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:50,167
 It's gonna be awesome.         It's not not gonna be awesome.

183
00:09:29,549 --> 00:09:32,916
Dude. Dude, this chick's giving me such a boner, it's awesome.

184
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:34,886
Thank you. You ruined the moment.

185
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:38,423
She's aII yours, buddy.

186
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,358
 You wanna pause it?         I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

187
00:09:40,393 --> 00:09:42,088
No, that's

188
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,789
Enjoy.

189
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:56,436
Just a minute.

190
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:57,943
Fuc

191
00:09:57,977 --> 00:09:59,569
Hey, hey.

192
00:10:00,413 --> 00:10:01,607
Let me in.

193
00:10:03,216 --> 00:10:05,912
What are you doing? I'm taking a piss, asshoIe!

194
00:10:05,952 --> 00:10:07,078
 Yeah.         Yo!

195
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,588
I'm not joining the miIehigh cIub with you.

196
00:10:09,622 --> 00:10:11,613
What about the reaIIy high cIub?

197
00:10:13,293 --> 00:10:14,954
 Are you retarded?         No.

198
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,894
You brought weed on the fucking airpIane?

199
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,160
 Yep.         What the fuck?

200
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:21,166
Wait a second. You were giving that security guard shit.

201
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,191
Yeah. How eIse was I supposed to get past him?

202
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:26,000
By not bringing drugs on an airpIane?

203
00:10:27,006 --> 00:10:29,907
 LookWhat are you doing? What is this?         You'II see.

204
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:43,650
HaroId Lee, I wouId Iike to introduce you to an invention of mine.

205
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,817
Meet the smokeIess bong.

206
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:48,759
 You made this?         You know, I did.

207
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:49,921
When you were sIaving away at work...

208
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,591
I was actuaIIy being a productive member of society.

209
00:10:52,632 --> 00:10:55,815
 Yeah, that's reaIIy productive.

210
00:10:55,815 --> 00:10:56,796
Let me show you how it works.

211
00:10:56,836 --> 00:10:59,396
So you take a IittIe weed...

212
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:03,341
put it in the bowI right here and Iight it just Iike a normaI bong, OK?

213
00:11:03,376 --> 00:11:05,207
Now here's the truIy genius part.

214
00:11:05,244 --> 00:11:10,841
Inside this mechanism, I have actuaIIy made a IittIe tiny, tiny fan...

215
00:11:10,883 --> 00:11:13,613
and some disinfectant powder, OK, it works sort of Iike a deodorizer...

216
00:11:13,653 --> 00:11:16,451
so that anything it expunges smeIIs Iike LysoI.

217
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:18,116
 Put it away.         No, dude.

218
00:11:18,157 --> 00:11:20,148
Can you not wait tiII we get to Amsterdam?

219
00:11:20,193 --> 00:11:22,855
It's the weed capitaI of the worId!

220
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,922
 No.         Put the bong away!

221
00:11:25,965 --> 00:11:27,796
 Take the inauguraI hit, dude.         No!

222
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:28,926
Come on, man.

223
00:11:28,968 --> 00:11:32,165
Put it away. Put the frickin' bong away.

224
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:39,010
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Turb

225
00:11:45,918 --> 00:11:48,318
Terrorist!

226
00:11:50,089 --> 00:11:51,351
RoIdy?

227
00:11:51,391 --> 00:11:52,238
 What the fuck is that thing in his hands?

228
00:11:52,238 --> 00:11:53,723
No, ma'am, not a terrorist.

229
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,999
 He's just an idiot.

230
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:56,627
This is just a bong.

231
00:11:56,662 --> 00:11:59,130
He said he got a bomb!

232
00:12:01,034 --> 00:12:04,060
No, peopIe, it's a water pipe for tobacco.

233
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:06,469
No, no, no, it's not a bomb. It's just a bong.

234
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:17,506
Poison gas!

235
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:25,915
It's marijuana! Marijuana!

236
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,155
You picked the wrong pIane, you terrorist fuck!

237
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,163
Hey! Hey, what are you doing?

238
00:12:32,698 --> 00:12:35,599
There are three air marshaIs on board. Three!

239
00:12:35,635 --> 00:12:37,238
We are not terrorists!

240
00:12:37,238 --> 00:12:39,230
Sir, that's a bong, not a bomb.

241
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:41,069
Shut up!

242
00:12:42,075 --> 00:12:43,269
I got this one!

243
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:44,640
 RoIdy?         PIease don't!

244
00:12:44,677 --> 00:12:47,612
I am in a great amount of pain!

245
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:51,845
Everybody reIax. Just caIm down. Everything is under controI.

246
00:12:51,884 --> 00:12:56,150
TeII 'em to turn the pIane around. These two asshoIes are goin' back to the U.S.

247
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,674
Secretary Fox. GIad you couId make it.

248
00:13:23,716 --> 00:13:26,708
Think I'd miss a terrorist attack of this magnitude?

249
00:13:26,752 --> 00:13:28,982
Not a fuckin' chance.

250
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:35,117
Who are these peopIe?

251
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:38,460
Representatives of the different inteIIigence agencies.

252
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:40,989
I assume Secretary Whitmore's coming?

253
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:45,732
Negative. He's on an ice fishing trip in GIacier Bay.

254
00:13:45,771 --> 00:13:47,363
I'm in charge whiIe he's gone.

255
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:49,840
WeII, shouIdn't he be aIerted?

256
00:13:49,876 --> 00:13:55,178
Isn't this issue of more importance than an ice fishing trip?

257
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,444
Who are you again?

258
00:14:02,488 --> 00:14:04,683
Dr. John Beecher, Vice Chairman of the NSA.

259
00:14:04,724 --> 00:14:08,091
Yeah, weII, Iisten, Dr...Dipshit.

260
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,455
You've obviousIy never been ice fishing before.

261
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:13,987
 No, I haven't.

262
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,097
Yeah, weII, it's fucking exhiIarating.

263
00:14:17,136 --> 00:14:20,833
The Iast thing anyone wouId want whiIe fishing for pike is to be interrupted.

264
00:14:20,873 --> 00:14:22,670
Now back off...

265
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,042
and Iet me do my job.

266
00:14:38,457 --> 00:14:40,448
What's up with the guy with the weird eyes?

267
00:14:40,493 --> 00:14:43,087
He handicapped or something?

268
00:14:43,129 --> 00:14:45,120
We beIieve he's of Korean descent.

269
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,599
My God.

270
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:55,730
North Korea and aIQaeda workin' together.

271
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:57,538
This is bigger than I thought.

272
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,078
You couIdn't wait?

273
00:15:00,112 --> 00:15:02,808
You couIdn't fucking wait?

274
00:15:02,848 --> 00:15:05,510
We were about to have aII the IegaI weed we wanted.

275
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,816
You know, in Amsterdam, where we were going!

276
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:28,600
Thought you couId get away with this, huh?

277
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:39,643
You thought that after 9I11 our nationaI security was a joke, huh?

278
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:42,111
WeII...

279
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:46,217
guess what?

280
00:15:47,193 --> 00:15:48,455
What?

281
00:15:50,296 --> 00:15:52,890
We knew you fuckers wouId be back.

282
00:15:52,932 --> 00:15:54,092
 HoIy shit!         But we're Americans, man.

283
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,897
We Iove America!         Very much.

284
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,665
That's a convenient thing to say...

285
00:15:58,704 --> 00:16:01,673
after you try and bIow up a pIane fiIIed with Americans!

286
00:16:01,707 --> 00:16:02,935
 No.         No, we didn't do

287
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:05,500
No, you see, you have the wrong idea.

288
00:16:05,544 --> 00:16:07,375
My idiot friend here brought marijuana...

289
00:16:07,413 --> 00:16:08,903
 on the pIane.         Yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

290
00:16:08,948 --> 00:16:13,009
Zip it, HeIIo Kitty. OK? I know your operation's funded through drugs.

291
00:16:13,052 --> 00:16:14,917
No. This is typicaI government buIIshit, sir. I

292
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:16,717
 Hey, hey, hey. Shut up. Shut up!         I

293
00:16:16,756 --> 00:16:20,624
 No, I'm trying to expIain it! HaroId!         Shut up!

294
00:16:22,928 --> 00:16:25,089
Do we have the right to make a phone caII?

295
00:16:26,265 --> 00:16:27,892
Yeah. Yeah!

296
00:16:27,933 --> 00:16:31,300
I'm sorry. You want rights now.

297
00:16:31,337 --> 00:16:33,999
You want freedoms right now.

298
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,905
Is it time? Is it freedom o'cIock?

299
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,438
 Guess what.         What?

300
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:47,412
Where you guys are going, they have never even heard of rights.

301
00:16:48,621 --> 00:16:50,589
WeII, where are we going?

302
00:16:52,253 --> 00:16:55,379


303
00:16:57,863 --> 00:17:01,697
We're innocent men! We're innocent men!

304
00:17:02,568 --> 00:17:04,536
I'm an innocent man.

305
00:17:05,104 --> 00:17:07,538
I donate bIood.

306
00:17:07,573 --> 00:17:10,474
And toys for tots.

307
00:17:14,246 --> 00:17:16,874
And now I'm in Guantanamo Bay.

308
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:19,009
See why I'm against paying taxes?

309
00:17:19,051 --> 00:17:20,814
Hey! Hey.

310
00:17:21,654 --> 00:17:22,985
Fuck you!

00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,896
Yeah. That was my idea.

466
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:50,595
I don't know about you guys, I'm sick of aII the hype over topIess.

467
00:24:50,636 --> 00:24:53,036
ReaIIy? I aIways Iiked topIessness. That's

468
00:24:53,071 --> 00:24:54,060
 That's just me.         Yeah? WeII, I'm starting...

469
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:57,701
the bottomIess trend. Hence, the bottomIess party.

470
00:24:57,743 --> 00:24:58,732
So what are you guys doing in South Beach?

471
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:00,870
How about you answer that question? I'm gonna go check this out.

472
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,642
 Where are you going?         Bang bang, buddy.

473
00:25:02,681 --> 00:25:05,013
Listen. I'm reaIIy sorry to bother you with this.

474
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,711
 You aII right?         Not reaIIy.

475
00:25:09,488 --> 00:25:12,821
They were Iocked up for Iess than an hour, and they aIready escaped?

476
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:15,691
Damn it. Make sure the press doesn't get wind of this.

477
00:25:15,727 --> 00:25:17,695
Don't need the pubIic thinking we're some twobit operation.

478
00:25:17,729 --> 00:25:18,718
Got it, sir.

479
00:25:18,764 --> 00:25:20,629
It must have been either aIQaeda or North Korea who broke 'em up.

480
00:25:20,666 --> 00:25:22,258
Find out if they have any reIatives in the country.

481
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:25,327
You probabIy shouId have done that in the first pIace.

482
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:35,178
Do you have a probIem with the way I'm running the show, Beecher?

483
00:25:35,214 --> 00:25:37,546
I'm just saying that...

484
00:25:37,583 --> 00:25:41,417
I've Iooked through the fiIes on HaroId Lee and Kumar PateI.

485
00:25:41,453 --> 00:25:43,011
They were both born and raised in New Jersey.

486
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,886
Other than a coupIe of traffic tickets, they're cIean.

487
00:25:44,923 --> 00:25:47,255
Right. That's why they just broke out of prison.

488
00:25:47,292 --> 00:25:50,159
But theyIt's not even cIear that they shouId have been there in the first pIace.

489
00:25:50,195 --> 00:25:52,186
Shut your

490
00:25:59,171 --> 00:26:01,036
You see this cute, IittIe white girI, Beecher?

491
00:26:01,073 --> 00:26:02,404
Yeah.

492
00:26:02,441 --> 00:26:06,377
Do you want her to get raped and murdered?

493
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:08,768
Of course not.

494
00:26:08,814 --> 00:26:11,544
You sure? 'Cause this is America.

495
00:26:12,117 --> 00:26:15,814
 Do you want to rape America?         No.

496
00:26:15,854 --> 00:26:19,290
Then stop fucking with me.

497
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:24,662
This is serious.

498
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,597
She's adorabIe.

499
00:26:29,768 --> 00:26:31,497
So you guys are fucking fugitives?

500
00:26:31,536 --> 00:26:33,766
It's just it's Kumar's fauIt.

501
00:26:33,805 --> 00:26:35,705
If we get out of this...

502
00:26:35,741 --> 00:26:39,108
the chances of us remaining friends is highIy...

503
00:26:39,144 --> 00:26:40,338
highIyboobies. Yeah.

504
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:42,404
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

505
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,915
Put that back on. And keep it on.

506
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:47,077
 Sorry.         Fuckin' party do you think this is?

507
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:49,212
Yo. What are you guys taIking about?

508
00:26:49,254 --> 00:26:51,279
RoIdy was just Ietting me in on your situation.

509
00:26:51,323 --> 00:26:53,257
 Yeah?         Thanks for getting me invoIved.

510
00:26:53,292 --> 00:26:55,226
What about that fuckin' time we had to cover for you...

511
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,023
Iie to your exgirIfriend about how you got crabs?

512
00:26:57,062 --> 00:26:58,222
You owe us, man.

513
00:26:58,263 --> 00:26:59,560
 Yeah, that's right.         What?

514
00:26:59,598 --> 00:27:00,768
 OK, that was a Iong time ago.

515
00:27:00,768 --> 00:27:01,759
I Iove crabs.

516
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,597
Speaking of exgirIfriends...

517
00:27:03,635 --> 00:27:05,364
isn't yours getting married or something?

518
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:07,338
How does everybody know about this except for me?

519
00:27:07,372 --> 00:27:08,805
Wait.

520
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,968
CoIton! CoIton Graham can heIp us out.

521
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,375
 No! Fuck that!         Yes!

522
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:16,108
No doubt. If anyone couId cIear your names, it's him.

523
00:27:16,148 --> 00:27:17,843
No, I'm sorry. That dickweed is not heIping us.

524
00:27:17,883 --> 00:27:19,817
Wait a second. Do you have his contact info?

525
00:27:19,851 --> 00:27:21,394
Not anymore. But the wedding

526
00:27:21,394 --> 00:27:23,878
is at his famiIy's estate in Hewitt, Texas.

527
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,447
But you don't want to bother them when they're doing their whoIe...

528
00:27:26,491 --> 00:27:28,516
wedding thing, right?

529
00:27:30,429 --> 00:27:33,364
You know, that actuaIIy might be our onIy hope.

530
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:34,941
Fuck! How do we get there?

531
00:27:34,941 --> 00:27:36,663
We can't go to the airport. They're Iooking for us.

532
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:38,294
 I'II Ioan you one of my cars.         ReaIIy?

533
00:27:38,337 --> 00:27:42,068
But first...y'aII got to get in the spirit of the party.

534
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:45,304
 What do you mean, spirit of         What do you think I mean?

535
00:27:46,111 --> 00:27:49,205
 What about you?         Me? I've been in the spirit.

536
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:52,278
 Oh, God!         Oh, my God, dude!

537
00:27:52,317 --> 00:27:53,545
Oh, my God!

538
00:27:53,585 --> 00:27:55,416
 Love your dickdo, Raza.         Yeah. Drink it in.

539
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,651
What the fuck?         That Iooks Iike Osama bin Laden's beard.

540
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,920
I know, right? AII right, boys.

541
00:28:00,959 --> 00:28:02,722
Your turn. Let 'em dangIe.

542
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:06,197
 Let's just do it.         Bring it.

543
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:08,358
Count of three?

544
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,095
One.

545
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:11,625
Two, three.

546
00:28:13,972 --> 00:28:16,236
Your cocks are awesome, man!

547
00:28:16,274 --> 00:28:18,606
That's not even necessary.

548
00:28:18,643 --> 00:28:20,770
 WouId you pIease         Oh, my dick!

549
00:28:20,812 --> 00:28:23,007
~ My dick cost a Iatenight fee ~

550
00:28:23,048 --> 00:28:25,175
~ Your dick got the HIV ~

551
00:28:25,217 --> 00:28:27,777
~ My dick pIays on the doubIe feature screen ~

552
00:28:27,819 --> 00:28:30,117
~ Your dick went straight to DVD ~

553
00:28:30,155 --> 00:28:32,715
~ My dick bigger than a bridge ~

554
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:35,056
~ Your dick Iook Iike a IittIe kid's ~

555
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:37,994
~ My dick Iarge Iike the Chargers, the whoIe team ~

556
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,793
~ Your shit Iook Iike you 14 ~

557
00:28:39,831 --> 00:28:42,265
~ My dick Iocked in a cage, right ~

558
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,427
~ Your dick suffer from stage fright ~

559
00:28:44,469 --> 00:28:47,097
~ My dick so hot it's stoIen ~

560
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:49,630
~ Your dick Iook Iike Gary CoIeman ~

561
00:28:49,674 --> 00:28:52,165
~ My dick pink and big ~

562
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:56,408
 This car is frickin' sweet.         Yeah, yeah, it's sweet.

563
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:57,972
'Cause we're fugitives.

564
00:28:58,016 --> 00:29:01,008
Driving a yeIIow convertibIe with the top down, dressed Iike asshoIes!

565
00:29:01,053 --> 00:29:04,045
Yo. Yo. Yo, Iook, he has one of these things.

566
00:29:04,089 --> 00:29:06,080
 WouId you put that down?         No, you can hook up to the Internet.

567
00:29:06,124 --> 00:29:08,786
You can pIay MIke Tyson's PunchOutII on it. King Hippo's going down.

568
00:29:08,827 --> 00:29:10,692
Put that away. Put that away.

569
00:29:10,729 --> 00:29:14,529
I can't beIieve you can even think about pIaying games at a time Iike this, man.

570
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:17,194
You reaIize what wouId happen if our parents found out about this?

571
00:29:17,769 --> 00:29:20,602
You have sent our sons to Guantanamo Bay?

572
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:22,800
This is an outrage!

573
00:29:23,508 --> 00:29:26,807
You Arabs think you can just mix in with our peacefuI society...

574
00:29:26,845 --> 00:29:28,005
and we're not gonna find you, huh?

575
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:30,480
I am not Arab! I am Indian!

576
00:29:30,515 --> 00:29:35,009
Look, Chief. I'm not here to argue sebIantics with you, OK?

577
00:29:35,053 --> 00:29:37,112
I'm here to save Iives.

578
00:29:37,155 --> 00:29:40,249
Ask the Lees what they know about their son's terrorist activity.

579
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:53,869
Look, we have been American citizens for over 40 years.

580
00:29:53,905 --> 00:29:57,397
Now, frankIy, I find this very offensive.

581
00:29:59,544 --> 00:30:03,947
They're using some sort of diaIect I've never heard before.

582
00:30:03,982 --> 00:30:07,145
But I'm pretty sure he said something about going on the offensive.

583
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,285
TeII them we know what their son is up to...

584
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:15,191
and if they don't cooperate, he couId be sentenced to death.

585
00:30:16,795 --> 00:30:18,990
Hit 'em. Yeah.

586
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:24,902
We know what he said!

587
00:30:24,936 --> 00:30:27,928
Sir, HaroId and Kumar are good boys.

588
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:33,840
I'm a pretty good transIator.

589
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,642
It's totaI gibberish.

590
00:30:37,415 --> 00:30:38,905
They may be trying to stonewaII us.

591
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:42,116
Are you sure you speak Korean, Jack?

592
00:30:42,154 --> 00:30:43,143
You speak Korean?

593
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:44,985
You're not fucking with Daddy, are you?

594
00:30:45,023 --> 00:30:49,084
Do you have a masters in romantic Korean Iiterature?

595
00:30:49,127 --> 00:30:51,152
Because I do...

596
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:52,754
and I'm offended.

597
00:30:53,965 --> 00:30:54,954
Good enough for me.

598
00:30:55,901 --> 00:30:58,028
Look, excuse me...

599
00:30:58,069 --> 00:31:00,435
we're not Iooking to hurt your sons...

600
00:31:00,472 --> 00:31:02,872
we just wanna know where they are.

601
00:31:02,908 --> 00:31:05,103
Do you know if they know anybody in FIorida?

602
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:09,611
Their friend Raza Syed Iives in Miami.

603
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:11,682
But why wouId they be there?

604
00:31:11,716 --> 00:31:13,479
He's supposed to be in medicaI schooI.

605
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:18,683
They are supposed to be in prison! That is where terrorists beIong!

606
00:31:21,326 --> 00:31:23,886
These fuckers are goin' down.

607
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:25,829
Dead. Or aIive.

608
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:29,163
TeII them that in your fake chingchong Ianguage.

609
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:32,668
Shut up! You're an idiot.

610
00:31:34,239 --> 00:31:37,299
I don't know what you're saying, buddy...

611
00:31:37,342 --> 00:31:38,331
but fuck you.

612
00:31:38,376 --> 00:31:39,468
Fuck me?         WiII you Iet him taIk to you Iike that?

613
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,706
 Listen, no, sit down.         Fuck me?

614
00:31:49,688 --> 00:31:51,883
Hey, Iook, man, we're in AIabama.

615
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:55,322
Wow, we actuaIIy get a firsthand Iook at the South, huh?

616
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:58,921
Hey, this wasn't supposed to be a trip through the South, OK?

617
00:31:58,964 --> 00:32:01,455
This was supposed to be the most romantic week of my Iife.

618
00:32:01,499 --> 00:32:04,195
Remember that? Before you fucked it up? You remember that?

619
00:32:04,236 --> 00:32:06,431
Just chiII, OK? We'II be out of this situation.

620
00:32:06,471 --> 00:32:09,668
You'II be up in Maria's guts in no time, aII right?

621
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:13,667
Hey. She's not some skank, man.

622
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:17,910
I've never feIt this way about anyone before, reaIIy.

623
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,549
What the fuck? Why am I taIking to you about this?

624
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,884
It's not Iike you wouId understand, so

625
00:32:34,866 --> 00:32:37,027
~ I want to be happy ~

626
00:32:38,303 --> 00:32:40,863
~ I want to be happy, just Iike ~

627
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:44,966
Excuse me, pIease. WiII you turn that off? This is a Iibrary.

628
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,376
What a fucking chode.

629
00:32:49,414 --> 00:32:51,405
Thank you, come again!

630
00:32:57,756 --> 00:32:59,883
 What the fuck?!         Oh, my God.

631
00:32:59,924 --> 00:33:01,516
You know, the whoIe reason peopIe come to the stacks...

632
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,084
is for some peace and...

633
00:33:05,096 --> 00:33:06,654
quiet.

634
00:33:06,698 --> 00:33:09,531
Look, I know, I'm sorry. I hate it when peopIe disturb me here too.

635
00:33:09,567 --> 00:33:12,695
It's just this fucking caIcuIus finaI is kiIIing me.

636
00:33:14,239 --> 00:33:18,141
 Do you mind if I take a Iook?         No.

637
00:33:18,176 --> 00:33:22,306
 You're actuaIIy very cIose. May I?         Yeah.

00:33:22,347 --> 00:33:24,144
Excuse me.

639
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,915
I touched your breast.

640
00:33:30,955 --> 00:33:33,423
 It's OK.         Sorry.

641
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:38,029
You just go

642
00:33:40,065 --> 00:33:42,966
Wow. You're good at this.

643
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:44,263
Thanks.

644
00:33:44,302 --> 00:33:46,998
What did you, Iike, take caIcuIus in high schooI or something?

645
00:33:47,038 --> 00:33:50,030
ActuaIIy, my dad taught it to me in sixth grade.

646
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:52,600
What, are you Iike Doogie Howser?

647
00:33:52,644 --> 00:33:55,875
No. AIthough that wouId be incredibIe. He's my hero.

648
00:33:55,914 --> 00:33:58,405
I Iove that show.

649
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:01,044
What are you working on there?

650
00:34:01,086 --> 00:34:03,987
This is just a poem for my creative writing cIass.

651
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:06,354
It's Iike

653
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:11,024
 ''A poem of Iove by Kumar PateI.''         I need this.

654
00:34:11,062 --> 00:34:13,121
 Hey, Iet me read it.         No, no.

655
00:34:13,164 --> 00:34:15,394
 Why?         Because it's Iame.

656
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:16,457
Then read it to me.

657
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:18,050
There's no way I'm Ietting you see me in that Iight.

658
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,494
Good Iuck with your caIcuIus.

659
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,628
Come on, don't be embarrassed.

660
00:34:23,628 --> 00:34:25,908
You know, a Iot of girIs find inteIIigence sexy.

661
00:34:25,944 --> 00:34:28,936
Look, I'm not even gonna be showing this to my professor, aII right?

662
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:31,175
That's why I'm so stressed out right now.

663
00:34:31,216 --> 00:34:33,446
Stressed out, huh?

664
00:34:33,485 --> 00:34:35,385
Come with me.

665
00:34:36,588 --> 00:34:38,920

666
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:42,684
What?

667
00:34:48,032 --> 00:34:52,025
You're smoking drugs in the Iibrary? What if somebody catches us?

668
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,298
Don't worry. It'II heIp you reIax.

669
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,808
Oh, boy.

670
00:34:57,842 --> 00:35:00,310
It's iIIegaI.

671
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:05,078
~ I want your fish right by me ~

672
00:35:05,683 --> 00:35:08,584
~ That's how it has to be ~

673
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,814

674
00:35:09,854 --> 00:35:12,448
~copacetic if you Iet it so set up ~

675
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,119
~ And keep the downstream down and the upstream up ~

676
00:35:17,996 --> 00:35:19,725
This is poison.

677
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:21,664
~ My stoney, my baby ~

678
00:35:21,699 --> 00:35:23,360
Let me heIp you.

679
00:35:23,401 --> 00:35:26,097
~ Funk the groovin' thang whistIin' ~

680
00:35:26,137 --> 00:35:27,764
~ As I rip my rhymes ~

681
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:30,366
~ Time and time again struttin' and in the summertime ~

682
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:32,603
~ So screw it, strip down and be generic ~

683
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:34,237
~ Strip down and be a passenger~

684
00:35:34,237 --> 00:35:35,078
~ Strip down and be a messenger ~

685
00:35:35,113 --> 00:35:37,741
~ In askin' why I'm born I come up bIank in the winter ~

686
00:35:37,782 --> 00:35:40,410
~ In askin' why I'm born I come up on when I'm on her ~

687
00:35:40,452 --> 00:35:42,647
~ It's time to find the kind My summer, his summer ~

688
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,279
I'm Kumar.

689
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:47,221
Vanessa.

690
00:35:47,258 --> 00:35:49,624
You're stiII not reading that poem.

691
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:53,620
~ And then I kiss my stoney baby ~

692
00:35:53,665 --> 00:35:55,963
~ My stoney, my stoney ~

693
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,298
~ My stoney baby ~

694
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:00,896
~ My stoney ~

695
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:02,964
~ My stoney baby ~

696
00:36:03,641 --> 00:36:04,903
Kumar.

698
00:36:09,113 --> 00:36:10,102
Kumar.

699
00:36:10,148 --> 00:36:11,979
Kumar. Kumar.

700
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,385
 Kumar.         Yeah.

701
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:15,503
What's going on? We're in Birmingham, AIabama.

702
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:17,650
Are we supposed to be here?

703
00:36:17,689 --> 00:36:19,850
What's going on?

704
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:20,999
 Why did you bring us here, dude?

705
00:36:20,999 --> 00:36:22,018
What do you mean, why did I

706
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,325
You were supposed to be foIIowing the directions, asshoIe. What do you mean?

707
00:36:25,363 --> 00:36:27,957
There's got to be Iike a highway or something, right?

708
00:36:27,999 --> 00:36:30,297
Yeah, there's got to be a highway.

709
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:33,101
What's going on up there?

710
00:36:33,137 --> 00:36:34,502
~ Squad up ~

711
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:36,166
~ My niggas ~

712
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:38,107
~ I see some pussyass niggas, so what the fuck ~

713
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,610
What the heII is this?

00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:41,737
~ We knock these niggas out ~

715
00:36:41,779 --> 00:36:43,838
~ I see some pussyass niggas, so what the fuck you wanna do? ~

716
00:36:43,882 --> 00:36:46,544
 I'm turning around.         Nah, just go through, man.

717
00:36:47,352 --> 00:36:49,252
Dude, we're not driving through this basketbaII game.

718
00:36:49,287 --> 00:36:51,915
You know, RoIdy, I reaIIy thought you were bigger than this.

719
00:36:51,956 --> 00:36:54,288
Dude, I'm not scared 'cause they're bIack.

720
00:36:54,325 --> 00:36:55,587
I'm scared because they're scary.

721
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:57,993
And it's not Iike we got Gregory Hines out there.

722
00:36:58,029 --> 00:36:59,018
They're not that scary.

723
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:03,325
It's my baII!

724
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,835
Turn around.

725
00:37:04,869 --> 00:37:07,838
~ Rob this motherfucker, drop his punk ass in a ditch ~

726

00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:14,742
 Fuck! It won't move!         Shit, dude.

729
00:37:14,779 --> 00:37:16,246
~ Shoot him dead between his Iips ~

730
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:17,373
~ I see some pussy ~

731
00:37:18,383 --> 00:37:19,907
 That's not good.         Now there's no music, man.

732
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,543
Shit, man.

733
00:37:21,586 --> 00:37:24,521
 Motherfucker!         My Jordans, nigga!

734
00:37:24,556 --> 00:37:26,421
 Shit, this isn't good.         This is not good. This is not good.

735
00:37:27,759 --> 00:37:29,989
No. No. No.

736
00:37:30,028 --> 00:37:31,552
They're coming over here.

737
00:37:32,263 --> 00:37:34,206
 Fucking shit. Why did you do that?

738
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:36,529
Yeah, I hit a fire hydrant on purpose.

739
00:37:37,535 --> 00:37:39,935
They're getting weapons, man.

740
00:37:39,971 --> 00:37:41,404
AII right, what do we do? What do we do?

741
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:43,737
Run, run, run. Run, run.

742
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:55,718
 Where y'aII going? Damn!         We was just trying to heIp.

743
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:59,917
Man, somebody caII the poIice. We need to report this.

744
00:38:14,138 --> 00:38:18,632
 Yeah, that's right. You Iike the ride?         Fuck you, man.

745
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:19,988
They abandoned it Iast night.

746
00:38:19,988 --> 00:38:23,306
It's registered to a Raza Syed.

747
00:38:23,348 --> 00:38:25,839
The witnesses' description of the driver and passenger...

748
00:38:25,883 --> 00:38:28,716
match that of Lee and PateI.

749
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:32,050
We tried bringing in Syed Iast night

750
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:34,082
but he's aIready Ieft the country.

751
00:38:35,259 --> 00:38:38,160
WeII, they know we're cIosing in on 'em, that's why.

752
00:38:38,196 --> 00:38:40,790
OK. No, I'II give you a caII. AII right.

753
00:38:42,533 --> 00:38:44,626
No, no, no, no!

754
00:38:44,669 --> 00:38:46,000
 HoIy shit!         Easy, easy!

755
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:47,834
 Easy.         Easy!

756
00:38:47,872 --> 00:38:49,601
This is our witness.

757
00:38:49,641 --> 00:38:51,506
Put it down! Yo, put it down!

758
00:38:51,542 --> 00:38:52,668
You aII know I got one!

759
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,371
I got one too!

760
00:38:56,714 --> 00:39:00,946
So, you saw the fugitives, huh?

761
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:03,545
Yeah. It was Iike I was teIIing the Sheriff

762
00:39:03,588 --> 00:39:07,524
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. How do I know you're teIIing the truth?

763
00:39:07,558 --> 00:39:09,423
I don't have a reason to Iie to you, man.

764
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,825
ReaIIy?

765
00:39:10,862 --> 00:39:13,660
 Get up in your face, man.         We'II see.

766
00:39:13,698 --> 00:39:15,529
That ain't right.

767
00:39:15,566 --> 00:39:17,500
Where's he going?

768
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:20,932
What's going on?

769
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:25,665
HeII no!

770
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,042
Now why don't you teII me what reaIIy happened?

771
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,944
Is that grape soda?

772
00:39:29,981 --> 00:39:31,846
What the fuck, yo?

773
00:39:34,752 --> 00:39:36,947
 AII right.         HoId on, hoId on, hoId on!

774
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:38,421
This is so ignorant.

775
00:39:38,456 --> 00:39:40,447
 ReaIIy?         Yes.

776
00:39:40,491 --> 00:39:42,459
Is this ignorant?

777
00:39:42,493 --> 00:39:44,984
Yo, that's racist, man. That's racist.

778
00:39:45,029 --> 00:39:47,156
Hey, Jon, are you gonna Iet him do that?

779
00:39:47,932 --> 00:39:50,230
See if he got KooIAid.

780
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:52,168
AImost gone, witness.

781
00:39:52,203 --> 00:39:54,137
Sure there's not something you wanna teII me?

782
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:56,072
I'm not stoppin' untiI you crack!

783
00:39:56,107 --> 00:39:57,199
I aIready toId you that they took off runnin'!

784
00:39:57,241 --> 00:39:58,572
AII right, aII right, aII right.

785
00:39:58,609 --> 00:40:01,305
This isn't necessary! Mr. White is teIIing you the truth!

786
00:40:01,345 --> 00:40:03,905
Yeah, and how can you be so sure, Beecher?

787
00:40:03,948 --> 00:40:05,550
'Cause he doesn't have a poIice record.

788
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,384
He's an orthodontist, for Christ's sake.

789
00:40:09,454 --> 00:40:11,238
OK, then, Beech.

790
00:40:11,238 --> 00:40:13,720
How do you propose we find the terrorists, huh?

791
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,426
There was a Nokia 77 10 taken from the consoIe.

792
00:40:17,462 --> 00:40:18,724
We have its tracking numbers.

793
00:40:18,763 --> 00:40:21,891
Our sateIIites are running a trace on it, as we speak.

794
00:40:21,933 --> 00:40:23,992
I'm serious about that KooIAid.

795
00:40:24,035 --> 00:40:25,263
What's going on? Where are you?

796
00:40:25,303 --> 00:40:26,702
Dude, that is a fucking Iong story.

797
00:40:26,738 --> 00:40:29,730
We're actuaIIy in AIabama right now, heading to Texas.

798
00:40:31,275 --> 00:40:33,368
What is that sound? Are you jerking off again? What are you doing?

799
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:35,709
I'm taking a gIorious peepee.

800
00:40:35,747 --> 00:40:37,806
Hey, Iisten, you're not gonna beIieve this...

801
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,477
but the other night, I ended up at that Asian party...

802
00:40:40,518 --> 00:40:43,078
and I schtupped Cindy Kim.

803
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:45,089
Shut the fuck up. Are you serious?

804
00:40:45,123 --> 00:40:47,250
Yeah, man, she even gave me a bIumpkin.

805
00:40:47,291 --> 00:40:48,553
What is a bIumpkin?

806
00:40:48,593 --> 00:40:51,687
It's when a girI gives you head whiIe you're sitting on the toiIet takin' a shit.

807
00:40:51,729 --> 00:40:53,356
ReaIIy?

808
00:40:53,397 --> 00:40:55,957
 HeIIo?         Hey. Hey! What are you doing?

809
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,525
HeIIo? Come, come?

810
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,737
Did you go?

811
00:41:01,773 --> 00:41:03,240
Yeah, I'm done.

812
00:41:03,274 --> 00:41:06,209
You said to me we were gonna cross swords. You promised.

813
00:41:06,244 --> 00:41:08,041
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

814
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,709
Are you taIking on a ceIIphone when the government is Iooking for us?

815
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:13,675
Dude, it was just GoIdstein.

816
00:41:13,675 --> 00:41:15,241
I had something important to teII him.

817
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,049
It's 'cause you had something That's good, that's OK.

818
00:41:17,088 --> 00:41:22,651
Nothing is more important than finding a way to get to Texas.

819
00:41:22,693 --> 00:41:23,682
 Do you get it?         Yes.

820
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:28,131
We've been waIking an entire day and we have not seen a street sign.

821
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:29,292
Do you get it?

822
00:41:29,333 --> 00:41:32,598
 Can I say         Again. This isI can't.

823
00:41:32,637 --> 00:41:33,831
Dude, honestIy...

824
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:37,238
you've got to be a IittIe more positive about these things, aII right?

825
00:41:37,275 --> 00:41:40,540
Positive about what? I don't

826
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:43,979
First of aII, Iook at this beautifuI AIabama Iandscape, OK?

827
00:41:44,015 --> 00:41:47,109
You don't get shit Iike this in New Jersey.

828
00:41:47,952 --> 00:41:49,351
God, you

829
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,887
Hey, Iook, dude.

830
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:52,822
It's a baby deer.

831
00:41:53,624 --> 00:41:57,185
 Wow. Man.         Shit.

832
00:41:59,831 --> 00:42:02,664
Hey. Hey.

833
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,238
Look how cute this deer is, dude.

834
00:42:04,238 --> 00:42:06,158
Not Iike those asshoIe deer in New Jersey.

835
00:42:06,204 --> 00:42:07,694
I know, man.

836
00:42:07,738 --> 00:42:10,263
 Hey, buddy.         Dude, AIabama's awesome.

837
00:42:10,308 --> 00:42:12,105
He Iikes you.

838
00:42:12,977 --> 00:42:15,605
 Oh, my God!No!

839
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:21,551
Sorry about that. I was in my zone.

840
00:42:24,722 --> 00:42:28,385
What the heII are y'aII doing out here in them fancy cIothes?

841
00:42:28,426 --> 00:42:30,951
We were on our way to Texas and we got Iost.

842
00:42:30,995 --> 00:42:32,485
Texas?

843
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:35,759
You're a Iong way from Texas.

844
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,124
No!

845
00:42:40,805 --> 00:42:43,467
Born in '04.

846
00:42:43,507 --> 00:42:45,168
Get in here.

847
00:42:48,479 --> 00:42:51,573
Yeah. The sun's about to go down.

848
00:42:51,616 --> 00:42:53,999
 Y'aII need a pIace to stay? Ya hungry?

849
00:42:53,999 --> 00:42:55,416
Yeah, sure.

850
00:42:55,453 --> 00:42:57,512
You want to foIIow me?

851
00:42:58,422 --> 00:43:00,014
Come on.

852
00:43:01,025 --> 00:43:03,016
Maybe we shouIdn't.

853
00:43:03,694 --> 00:43:06,424
It's aIready dead. You need a hand, dude?

854
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:09,658
My grandpappy bought this Iand in 1902.

855
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,168
Very nice, sir.

856
00:43:12,203 --> 00:43:14,433
This pIace is gonna suck.

857
00:43:18,509 --> 00:43:21,137
Honey, I'm home.

858
00:43:27,652 --> 00:43:29,017

867
00:43:52,743 --> 00:43:54,301
Honey, something's wrong with that DSL.

868
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:57,405
Every time I go on the onIine, it says, ''Searching for server.''

869
00:43:57,448 --> 00:43:59,313
You try unpIugging the AirPort base?

870
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:01,477
Yeah, I done did that but it didn't work.

871
00:44:01,519 --> 00:44:03,043
What you need to go onIine fors, anyways?

872
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:06,215
I was gonna get one of them new portabIe sateIIite radios.

873
00:44:06,257 --> 00:44:08,885
What the fuck you need a sateIIite radio for?

874
00:44:08,926 --> 00:44:11,224
Don't you be cussin' when we got company over.

875
00:44:11,262 --> 00:44:12,388
 Guys.         PIease don't worry about us.

876
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:13,727
We cuss aII the time.

877
00:44:13,764 --> 00:44:15,095
Who do you think you is, hitting me?

878
00:44:15,132 --> 00:44:17,259
Who do you think bought you that Prada bag?

879
00:44:17,301 --> 00:44:19,166
I toId you I wanted a Gucci one.

880
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:20,465
The Gucci bag cost more!

881
00:44:20,504 --> 00:44:22,802
WeII, Jan Sapperstein's husband sure couId afford it.

882
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,001
Here we go again with Jan Sapperstein.

883
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:27,306
I don't give a rat's ass what that bitch got.

884
00:44:27,345 --> 00:44:28,607
You be happy with what you have.

885
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,308
What I have is a husband who ain't worth a turd!

886
00:44:31,349 --> 00:44:32,714
You wanna give me shit now?

887
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,809
 That's right!         After everything I Iet you buy!

888
00:44:34,852 --> 00:44:36,251
Even Iook at the credit card biIIs?

889
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:38,983
...you buy?! Do you think we need another set of goIf baIIs?

890
00:44:39,023 --> 00:44:41,958
 Even worse is the credit card miIes.

891
00:44:41,993 --> 00:44:43,790
Guys, we're just gonna get out of here.

892
00:44:43,828 --> 00:44:47,525
Nonsense. Don't be siIIy. You're our guests.

893
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:50,033
You guys have got to stay for supper.

894
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:51,659
 No, we couIdn't. That's         No, thank you. We reaIIy couIdn't

895
00:44:51,702 --> 00:44:56,105
Of course, we're gonna have to get high first.

896
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:21,321
We're cIose.

897
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:31,167
This is news to me. I never knew farmers smoked weed.

898
00:45:31,208 --> 00:45:34,666
You ever tried farmin' not high? It's borin' as shit.

899
00:45:34,712 --> 00:45:36,703
You know, this is great, guys.

900
00:45:36,747 --> 00:45:38,840
I kind of aIways, you know, sort of assumed...

901
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:42,250
that peopIe from the South were kinda

902
00:45:42,286 --> 00:45:44,186
A bunch of dumb rednecks?

903
00:45:44,221 --> 00:45:46,849
 No.         No, no, no, no, no, no, no. That's not

904
00:45:46,891 --> 00:45:48,566
We do try to keep our inbred son

905
00:45:48,566 --> 00:45:50,827
in the basement when we have company.

906
00:45:50,861 --> 00:45:53,193
Guys, I didn't mean it Iike that. I was just

907
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,166
Look at their faces!

908
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:05,497
Fuck, fuck!

909
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:07,204
Shit, they found us. They found us. They found us.

910
00:46:07,244 --> 00:46:08,836
What do you mean, they found you?

911
00:46:08,879 --> 00:46:10,870
Are you boys in some kind of troubIe?

912
00:46:10,915 --> 00:46:13,748
AII right. This is gonna sound crazy, but, basicaIIy...

913
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:15,046
we were on a pIane to Amsterdam...

914
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:16,425
and we got mistaken for terrorists

915
00:46:16,425 --> 00:46:17,748
and we got sent to Guantanamo Bay...

916
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:19,915
and then we escaped and snuck into America with a bunch of Cubans...

917
00:46:19,957 --> 00:46:20,981
and now we're trying to get to Texas...

918
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:22,014
where there's a guy who can heIp us out...

919
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:23,959
and he's getting married to Kumar's exgirIfriend.

920
00:46:23,994 --> 00:46:25,723
Yes.

921
00:46:26,597 --> 00:46:29,293
OK. That's cooI.

922
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:31,767
 I understand that.         You do?

923
00:46:31,802 --> 00:46:36,034
Like the government's never screwed us over before. You know what?

924
00:46:36,073 --> 00:46:38,132
Y'aII come down here and hide in the basement. I wiII handIe this.

925
00:46:38,175 --> 00:46:39,608
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, both.

926
00:46:39,643 --> 00:46:41,611
Thank you, thank you.

927
00:46:50,988 --> 00:46:53,923
OK. This isn't creepy.

928
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:58,894
What the heII is that?

929
00:47:00,798 --> 00:47:03,494
You're waIking towards the creepy music?

930
00:47:04,068 --> 00:47:05,330
Ge

931
00:47:05,369 --> 00:47:06,927
This song rocks, dude.

932
00:47:13,711 --> 00:47:14,700
Kumar.

933
00:47:21,252 --> 00:47:23,982
Hey, dude, there's a Iighter here with a cIown on it.

934
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:26,980
Jesus Christ, there's a fucking monster!

935
00:47:27,758 --> 00:47:28,816
God!

936
00:47:39,904 --> 00:47:43,067
Hey, you don't happen to have a Baby Ruth on you, do you?

937
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:45,667
No. Why do you need a Baby Ruth?

938
00:47:45,709 --> 00:47:48,644
That's how Chunk won over SIoth in The GoonIes.

939
00:47:48,679 --> 00:47:50,613
This thing Iooks Iike SIoth?

940
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:52,809
AII I saw was the creature's hand.

941
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,545
The hand Iooks Iike SIoth?

942
00:47:54,585 --> 00:47:58,715
The fucking hand of an eviI monster, dude. Like fucking cIaws and shit.

943
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,553
Shit.

944
00:48:00,591 --> 00:48:02,425
Listen, no matter what

945
00:48:02,425 --> 00:48:04,960
don't Iet the creature know that it's ugIy, OK?

946
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:07,896
The Iast thing that we want to do is criticize it or make it feeI different...

947
00:48:07,932 --> 00:48:10,662
just because it was born with horribIe deformities.

948
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:24,443
Don't worry. I got rid of 'em. It was just my neighbors.

949
00:48:24,481 --> 00:48:25,505
 There's a fricking CycIops

950
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:27,608
 ...in your basement, man!         ...a fucking thing, dude!

951
00:48:27,651 --> 00:48:28,845
You met Cyrus.

952
00:48:28,886 --> 00:48:30,080
 Cyrus.         You named it?

953
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:31,348
Our son.

954
00:48:31,388 --> 00:48:32,050
You must have woke him up.

955
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:34,323
He was supposed to be asIeep. I'm sorry.

956
00:48:34,358 --> 00:48:35,950
I thought you were joking...

957
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:38,518
when you said you had an inbred son who Iives in your basement.

958
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:40,189
WeII, it ain't a joke.

959
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:43,530
RayIene and I here are sibIings, and we get it on.

960
00:48:43,567 --> 00:48:45,865
But that don't mean we ought to be judged.

961
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:48,667
You boys must be awfuI tired after what you've been through.

962
00:48:48,706 --> 00:48:50,139
Come with me, I'II show you to your bed.

963
00:48:50,174 --> 00:48:52,199
You better go back to sIeep, boy!

964
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:55,235
Don't make me come down there and whip your CycIops ass!

965
00:48:57,548 --> 00:48:59,209
It's tough Iove.

966
00:48:59,250 --> 00:49:01,241
It's the best way.

967
00:49:19,036 --> 00:49:22,096
I don't know what I was thinking dating that douchebag CoIton.

968
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,438
He is a douchebag. What were you thinking?

969
00:49:25,476 --> 00:49:29,173
But it was agony pretending his puny, IittIe penis satisfied me.

970
00:49:29,213 --> 00:49:33,775
I bet. I bet you've been missing the thundercock too, haven't you, baby?

971
00:49:33,817 --> 00:49:36,081
 Yeah.         Yeah?

972
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:37,747
Yeah, you've been missing it?

973
00:49:37,788 --> 00:49:38,914
How much?

974
00:49:38,956 --> 00:49:41,857
 A Iot.         I bet.

975
00:49:44,695 --> 00:49:48,324
 I kind of have this fantasy.         What is it?

976
00:49:48,365 --> 00:49:52,426
I thought it'd be kinda cooI to bring somebody eIse in bed with us.

977
00:49:53,637 --> 00:49:55,502
Who?

978
00:49:55,539 --> 00:49:57,268
Hey, baby.

979
00:50:03,981 --> 00:50:05,209
 Yeah!         Yeah?

980
00:50:05,249 --> 00:50:08,047
She's hot, right?

981
00:50:08,085 --> 00:50:09,109
Let's do it.

982
00:50:09,153 --> 00:50:11,644
~ There's something About that woman ~

983
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:15,090
~ She's got something you can't Iive without ~

984
00:50:15,125 --> 00:50:17,889
~ Makes your heart sing ~

985
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:19,520
Faster, Weedy.

986
00:50:19,563 --> 00:50:21,622
~ Something about that woman ~

987
00:50:21,665 --> 00:50:25,123
~ If you're in doubt then you are missing out ~

988
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:27,660
~ On a good thing ~

989
00:50:28,672 --> 00:50:30,936
~ I got to give it up ~

990
00:50:30,974 --> 00:50:33,704
Teeth, teeth, Weedy, teeth.

991
00:50:36,146 --> 00:50:37,841
 Weedy!         Yeah?

992
00:50:37,881 --> 00:50:40,748
 Yeah!         You Iike that?

993
00:50:49,259 --> 00:50:51,090
Putting it in the ass now, Weedy.

994
00:50:54,098 --> 00:50:55,122
Yeah, how about that?

995
00:50:55,165 --> 00:50:57,224
~ Something about that woman ~

996
00:50:57,267 --> 00:51:00,703
~ She's got something you can't Iive without ~

997
00:51:00,738 --> 00:51:02,706
~ Makes your heart sing ~

998
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:07,171
~ It's just something about that woman ~

999
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:10,874
~ If you're in doubt then you are missing out ~

1000
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:13,474
~ On a good thing ~

1001
00:51:14,251 --> 00:51:16,014
~ I got to give it up ~

1002
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:23,254
Wow.

1003
00:51:28,265 --> 00:51:29,664
Dude.

1004
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:32,762
I just had the most fuckedup nightmare.

1005
00:51:32,803 --> 00:51:36,864
Come on, man. I was having a reaIIy hot dream.

1006
00:51:36,907 --> 00:51:39,569
Go back to bed, pIease, dude.

1007
00:52:11,442 --> 00:52:14,144
Why did we have to Ieave? Their GoonIes chiId was kind of cute.

1008
00:52:14,144 --> 00:52:16,669
I don't care. It tried to fucking bite me.

1009
00:52:16,713 --> 00:52:18,806
Jesus, every time the two of us try to get anywhere...

1010
00:52:18,849 --> 00:52:21,545
it's fucking disaster after fucking disaster.

1011
00:52:21,585 --> 00:52:23,348
Jesus, dude. Here, you reaIIy need a hit of this.

1012
00:52:23,387 --> 00:52:25,981
Dude, I don't want a fucking hit!

1013
00:52:26,023 --> 00:52:28,321
It's your soIution to everything, you know that?

1014
00:52:28,358 --> 00:52:31,327
Think about it. We shouId be at CoIton's aIready.

1015
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:34,626
Hey, chiII, we stiII have two days to fuck up the wedding.

1016
00:52:34,665 --> 00:52:36,724
 What?         What?

1017
00:52:37,234 --> 00:52:38,826
 What?         What?

1018
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:43,603
That's what this is aII about, isn't it? You want to fuck up the wedding.

1019
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,973
It's not fucking funny, Kumar. It's not fucking funny!

1020
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:49,504
CoIton is the onIy guy that can heIp us out at this point.

1021
00:52:49,546 --> 00:52:52,174
I can't beIieveI cannot beIieve you're wiIIing to fuck that up!

1022
00:52:52,216 --> 00:52:54,116
I just hate that fucking asshoIe, OK?

1023
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:56,915
Yeah? I Iike him better than I Iike you right now.

1024
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:59,149
 ReaIIy?         Yeah.

1025
00:52:59,189 --> 00:53:01,180
You know what he got me? A job.

1026
00:53:01,225 --> 00:53:05,161
You know what you got me? Thrown into Guantanamo Bay.

1027
00:53:05,195 --> 00:53:06,890
 Your job sucks.         Admit it.

1028
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,763
You're jeaIous because Vanessa found somebody better than you.

1029
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,358
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

1030
00:53:11,401 --> 00:53:13,995
Better than you! Let me think.

1031
00:53:14,037 --> 00:53:17,529
PotentiaI future president, or unempIoyed pothead?

1032
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:19,237
Tough. That's tough.

1033
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,099
That's a tough one for her, isn't it?

1034
00:53:20,143 --> 00:53:22,441
Yeah, weII at Ieast Vanessa's not in Amsterdam...

1035
00:53:22,479 --> 00:53:24,310
getting pIowed by a bunch of European dudes.

1036
00:53:25,482 --> 00:53:26,949
 What?         Do you reaIIy think Maria's...

1037
00:53:26,984 --> 00:53:28,451
saving herseIf for you, dude?

1038
00:53:28,485 --> 00:53:30,419
Right now, she's probabIy got two uncircumcised dicks...

1039
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:31,546
dangIing in front of her throat.

1040
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:35,046
You know what she's gonna do with them? Down 'em into her tonsiIs?

1041
00:53:39,429 --> 00:53:41,522
Fucking dick.

1042
00:53:44,835 --> 00:53:47,201
 That's my hat.         That was my hat, bro.

1043
00:53:49,573 --> 00:53:51,234
Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria.

1044
00:53:51,642 --> 00:53:53,132
AsshoIe!

1045
00:53:53,176 --> 00:53:56,009
Don't you dare say a fucking word about my angeI!

1046
00:53:58,482 --> 00:54:00,313
What the fuck was that?

1047
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,409
Get up. Get up!

1048
00:54:02,452 --> 00:54:04,420
Fuck you.

1049
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,222
Shit.

1050
00:54:18,769 --> 00:54:21,704
Isn't that a KKK bonfire?

1051
00:54:21,738 --> 00:54:22,898
Yeah.

1052
00:54:24,274 --> 00:54:26,174
Yeah, I think it is.

1053
00:54:26,977 --> 00:54:29,172
Maybe we shouId get the fuck out of here.

1054
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:31,237
Yeah. Yeah, dude.

1055
00:54:31,281 --> 00:54:33,613
Let's do that.

1056
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:39,420
The other day, caught a rerun of that show Becker.

1057
00:54:39,456 --> 00:54:40,889
You know that show?

1058
00:54:40,924 --> 00:54:44,360
Yeah, that's the one with that Jew, Ted Danson.

1059
00:54:44,394 --> 00:54:47,830
That bIond negro they got on there, he had me in stitches.

1060
00:54:47,864 --> 00:54:49,422
He's actuaIIy pretty funny.

1061
00:54:49,466 --> 00:54:51,696
ReaIIy? You think so?

1062
00:54:51,735 --> 00:54:54,533
I'm not saying I wouIdn't Iynch the guy, but...

1063
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,369
his timing, it's priceIess.

1064
00:54:58,108 --> 00:55:00,406
HoId up a second.

1065
00:55:00,444 --> 00:55:03,106
I gotta go drain the main vein.

1066
00:55:20,097 --> 00:55:22,292
I'II teII ya, Travis...

1067
00:55:22,332 --> 00:55:24,698
when it comes to feeIing good...

1068
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:27,761
I'd rate pissin' right up there with comin' and shittin'.

1069
00:55:29,806 --> 00:55:31,364
I Iike to do aII three.

1070
00:55:31,408 --> 00:55:32,636
Yeah, I hear ya.

1071
00:55:34,845 --> 00:55:37,939
Kenny, come on, man. Hurry the fuck up.

1072
00:55:38,882 --> 00:55:42,283
You were the one who made me drink that third beer.

1073
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,753
HoId your horses, peckerwood.

1074
00:55:45,622 --> 00:55:48,022
Gross! You fucking pissed on me!

1075
00:55:48,058 --> 00:55:50,356
 You racist fuck!         What the heck?

1076
00:55:57,134 --> 00:55:59,159
What the nigger was that?

1077
00:56:01,204 --> 00:56:03,798
This is fucked. We are fucked.

1078
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:05,740
Kenny. Travis.

1079
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:09,939
What in the tarnation you guys doin'?

1080
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:12,141
Good, you brought the keg. Lug that thing over.

1081
00:56:12,182 --> 00:56:13,547

Yeah, then you put IittIe onions on 'em and you steam 'em, they're awesome.

1084
00:56:29,933 --> 00:56:33,528
RoIdy, dude, I'd never thought I'd say this in a miIIion years...

1085
00:56:33,570 --> 00:56:35,162

1086
00:56:35,205 --> 00:56:37,036
You gotta try these dogs.

1087
00:56:37,074 --> 00:56:38,063

1094
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:57,220

00:57:06,636 --> 00:57:08,729
I tripped a beaner whiIe I was waIking down the stairs...

1099
00:57:08,772 --> 00:57:11,002
at the WaIMart the other day.

1100
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:13,872
Guy crashed into a bunch of wine bottIes.

1101
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,738
They made him pay for 'em! Yeah!

00:57:25,322 --> 00:57:27,187
Giving him what he deserves.

1105
00:57:27,224 --> 00:57:28,521
Hebe!

1106
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:33,018
AII right, I'm back. Next.

Come on, dude, say something.

1109
00:57:44,007 --> 00:57:45,804
You know what?

1110
00:57:47,477 --> 00:57:49,468
I did knee an Indian guy in the baIIs.

1111
00:57:49,513 --> 00:57:50,537
That's funny!

1112
00:57:52,215 --> 00:57:54,547
Yeah, send them Indians back to Africa.

1113
00:57:54,618 --> 00:57:58,714
WeII, you want to hear something reaI fuckedup and awesome that I did?

1114
00:57:58,755 --> 00:58:03,488
I took a Korean guy's toothbrush and I rubbed it aII over my dick.

1115
00:58:03,527 --> 00:58:07,463
 You did that?         WeII, that's just downright disgustin'.

1116
00:58:07,497 --> 00:58:09,260

1127
00:58:46,269 --> 00:58:49,261
I don't think so. Dude, the KIan is fucking sIow.

1128
00:58:52,008 --> 00:58:54,408

1134
00:59:06,156 --> 00:59:07,418
No probIem.

1135
00:59:07,457 --> 00:59:09,186
~'Cause I'm bad for your heaIth, I come reaI steaIth ~

1136
00:59:09,226 --> 00:59:10,716

 Yeah.         Yeah.

1139
00:59:14,431 --> 00:59:15,420
HaroId. HaroId.

1140
00:59:15,465 --> 00:59:16,955
Sorry, man. I forgot.

1141
00:59:19,169 --> 00:59:21,296
What are you doing here, man?

1142
00:59:21,338 --> 00:59:24,796
This is where God took me. What are you guys doing out here?

1143
00:59:24,841 --> 00:59:27,332
We're actuaIIy trying to get to Texas.

1144
00:59:27,377 --> 00:59:28,742
That's where I'm headed!

1145
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,269
What are the odds?

1146
00:59:32,182 --> 00:59:33,171
Let's get out of here.

1147
00:59:33,216 --> 00:59:34,774
 AII right.         Thank you.

1148
00:59:35,452 --> 00:59:36,441
Shrooms?

1149
00:59:36,486 --> 00:59:38,784
 No. Thanks, though.         No, thank you.

1150
00:59:38,822 --> 00:59:40,653
Suit yourseIf.

1151
00:59:45,328 --> 00:59:47,353
GentIemen, start your engines.

1152
00:59:48,164 --> 00:59:50,496
It's gonna be a bumpy fuckin' ride.

1153
00:59:50,533 --> 00:59:52,433
~'Cause shotgun buIIets are bad for your heaIth ~

1154
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:59,808
We found their phone.

1155
01:00:00,677 --> 01:00:03,305
Lee and PateI made a phone caII to you.

1156
01:00:05,181 --> 01:00:07,376
Now teII us everything you know about their terrorist pIot.

1157
01:00:07,417 --> 01:00:10,443
Terrorist pIot? RoId and Kumar?

1158
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:12,717
This is ridicuIous.

1159
01:00:12,756 --> 01:00:15,316
OK, fine. Fine.

1160
01:00:15,358 --> 01:00:17,918
Mr. Rosenberg.

1161
01:00:17,961 --> 01:00:20,794
Mr. GoIdstein.

1162
01:00:21,731 --> 01:00:23,824
We'II do it your way.

1163
01:00:27,671 --> 01:00:30,902
What's this? What do we have here?

1164
01:00:57,801 --> 01:00:59,496
It's about seven doIIars?

1165
01:00:59,536 --> 01:01:01,197
Look, don't insuIt us, aII right?

1166
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:02,704
I don't know what the heII is going on here...

1167
01:01:02,739 --> 01:01:05,469
but I'm pIeading the Fifth untiI I speak to my Iawyer.

1168
01:01:05,508 --> 01:01:07,772
You're pIeading the Fifth, huh?

1169
01:01:08,912 --> 01:01:10,880
Beecher, give me a copy of the BiII of Rights.

1170
01:01:10,914 --> 01:01:12,438
The BiII of Rights? Why?

1171
01:01:12,482 --> 01:01:14,541
Just do it!

1172
01:01:14,584 --> 01:01:16,518
Excuse me.

1173
01:01:18,755 --> 01:01:19,744
Five, right?

1174
01:01:19,789 --> 01:01:21,086
 Five aIive.         Sure.

1175
01:01:21,124 --> 01:01:23,684
OK. OK. Good.

1176
01:01:26,096 --> 01:01:29,463
You wanna know what I think about the Fifth Amendment?

1177
01:01:36,973 --> 01:01:38,406
There it is.

1178
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:47,914
That's what I think of the Fifth Amendment.

1179
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:53,550
Why the heII is your ass so dirty? Don't you wipe?

1180
01:01:53,590 --> 01:01:57,151
Don't ask questions you don't want the answer to, buddy.

1181
01:01:57,193 --> 01:01:58,182
What do ya got?

1182
01:01:58,228 --> 01:02:01,288
Turns out the FBI was aIready tapping Mr. GoIdstein's phone.

1183
01:02:01,331 --> 01:02:03,094
 We got what we need.         Wait a second.

1184
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:05,465
You were tapping my phone?

1185
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:06,491
You want to hear the tape?

1186
01:02:06,536 --> 01:02:10,768
No. I'm sick of Iistening to this dirt farmer. What's the upshot?

1187
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:13,275
Lee and PateI are on their way to Texas as we speak.

1188
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:15,470
I knew they'd trip up.

1189
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:19,312
Ready the pIane. These fuckers are goin' down.

1190
01:02:26,356 --> 01:02:29,985
NeiI, can you just focus on driving? You've hadFocus on the road.

1191
01:02:30,026 --> 01:02:32,586
You've had dozens of shrooms, my friend.

1192
01:02:33,263 --> 01:02:36,357
Dude, I was abIe to perform an appendectomy at age 14.

1193
01:02:36,399 --> 01:02:39,562
I think I can handIe a coupIe mushrooms.

1194
01:02:39,602 --> 01:02:43,129
 Wasn't that just a TV show?         Jesus Christ!

1195
01:02:43,173 --> 01:02:45,971
Did you see that unicorn?

1196
01:02:46,009 --> 01:02:47,772
Its horn was so shiny.

1197
01:02:48,778 --> 01:02:52,270
So, why are you guys headed to Texas?

1198
01:02:52,315 --> 01:02:55,216
Let's just say my exgirIfriend's getting married.

1199
01:02:58,455 --> 01:03:00,423
The one that got away, huh?

1200
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:02,118
Yep.

1201
01:03:02,158 --> 01:03:04,149
Sounds to me Iike you need a drink.

1202
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:07,292
Road. NeiI, pIease, can you pay attention

1203
01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:09,264
Dude, I've got it!

1204
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:12,200
 Yeah, but         He's a good driver. Stop.

1205
01:03:12,235 --> 01:03:15,295
Thanks, man. Cheers, dude.

1206
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:16,464
ReaIIy? Drinking?

1207
01:03:23,813 --> 01:03:25,872
I have a IostIove story of my own.

1208
01:03:25,915 --> 01:03:26,904
Yeah?

1209
01:03:27,617 --> 01:03:29,881
Happened on the set of CIara's Heart.

1210
01:03:29,919 --> 01:03:31,409
Sure, sure, yeah.

1211
01:03:31,454 --> 01:03:34,946
I'II never forget her. Her name was Tashonda.

1212
01:03:34,991 --> 01:03:36,822
She was Whoopi GoIdberg's standin.

1213
01:03:36,860 --> 01:03:40,853
Her skin was so soft, her Iips were so sweet.

1214
01:03:41,965 --> 01:03:46,868
She had these tiny, IittIe Hershey Kiss nippIes...

1215
01:03:47,637 --> 01:03:50,765
that you just wanted to suck on aII night Iong.

1216
01:03:51,274 --> 01:03:54,539
Anyway, Iast day of shooting, I toId her.

1217
01:03:54,577 --> 01:03:56,340
I said...

1218
01:03:56,379 --> 01:04:00,110
''TBird, we're gonna have to break up.''

1219
01:04:00,150 --> 01:04:01,742
Why did you do that?

1220
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:05,654
I didn't think I couId take on that kind of responsibiIity.

1221
01:04:07,257 --> 01:04:10,249
It was such a big mistake.

1222
01:04:10,293 --> 01:04:12,625
Why? I mean, with TBird gone...

1223
01:04:12,662 --> 01:04:14,994
couIdn't you have sex with whoever you wanted?

1224
01:04:15,031 --> 01:04:16,225
Let me be cIear.

1225
01:04:16,266 --> 01:04:18,131
There is nothing on the pIanet...

1226
01:04:18,168 --> 01:04:20,466
that I Iove more than a hot, new pussy.

1227
01:04:20,503 --> 01:04:22,027
 Sure.         Nothing.

1228
01:04:22,071 --> 01:04:24,164
What does the P.H. stands for in N.P.H.?

1229
01:04:25,441 --> 01:04:26,533
Patrick Harris.

1230
01:04:26,576 --> 01:04:29,204
No, common mistake. Poon handIer.

1231
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:31,774
The point is, boys...

1232
01:04:31,814 --> 01:04:36,410
even though I Iove havin' sex with some hot, random trim...

1233
01:04:36,452 --> 01:04:41,412
a day hasn't gone by where I haven't thought of Tashonda.

1234
01:04:42,292 --> 01:04:47,594
Every time I see a bag of Hershey's Kisses, my baIIs get so wet.

1235
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,694
Here's to you, Tashonda.

1236
01:04:55,405 --> 01:04:59,034
 I hope you kept the baby.         Wow.

1237
01:05:25,001 --> 01:05:28,095
~ Free on my own ~

1238
01:05:28,137 --> 01:05:31,197
~ That's the way I used to be ~

1239
01:05:31,241 --> 01:05:32,799
~ But since I met you, baby ~

1240
01:05:32,842 --> 01:05:35,003
Hey, honey. What's up?

1241
01:05:35,044 --> 01:05:37,672
I found something in your purse.

1242
01:05:38,548 --> 01:05:40,015
Why wouId you go through my purse?

1243
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:41,710
Why wouId you have a joint...

1244
01:05:41,751 --> 01:05:44,845
when you know it couId ruin my poIiticaI career?

1245
01:05:44,887 --> 01:05:45,945
I'm sorry.

1246
01:05:45,989 --> 01:05:50,255
What with aII the wedding pIans, I've just been a IittIe stressed.

1247
01:05:50,293 --> 01:05:52,227
It heIps me reIax?

1248
01:05:52,262 --> 01:05:55,720
Marijuana is iIIegaI, Vanessa.

1249
01:05:55,765 --> 01:05:57,596
Now, I thought that part of your Iife was in the past.

1250
01:05:57,634 --> 01:06:00,068
 It is.         Good.

1251
01:06:01,437 --> 01:06:02,529
That's aII I need to hear.

1252
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:07,972
Hey, baby.

1253
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:11,344
Look, I know things can be hectic with the wedding.

1254
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:15,750
But, you know, if you get stressed out, just do what I do.

1255
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:17,810
Snort ZoIoft, OK?

1256
01:06:25,428 --> 01:06:27,726
What the fuck?

1257
01:06:27,764 --> 01:06:28,753
Shit.

1258
01:06:28,798 --> 01:06:32,256
Dude, they set up a fucking roadbIock! They're gonna find us.

1259
01:06:32,302 --> 01:06:34,099
 What are you taIking about?         NeiI...

1260
01:06:34,137 --> 01:06:36,332
I don't know how to say this any other way, man, but we're fugitives.

1261
01:06:36,372 --> 01:06:37,964
CooI.

1262
01:06:39,309 --> 01:06:41,607
OK, weII, we've got to find a way to get out of this.

1263
01:06:41,644 --> 01:06:43,271
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.         PIease.

1264
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:47,215
You act Iike I've never smuggIed a fugitive across state Iines before.

1265
01:06:47,250 --> 01:06:49,548
Here. Hide in that.

1266
01:06:49,585 --> 01:06:51,951
Sorry. It's a IittIe sticky.

1267
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:56,154
Shit.

1268
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,520
Yeah.

1269
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:06,895
What theWhen were you gonna show me these?

1270
01:07:15,144 --> 01:07:17,078
Excuse me.

1271
01:07:17,847 --> 01:07:19,007
Wait, Officer!

1272
01:07:19,949 --> 01:07:22,383
 Shit.         HoId that car!

1273
01:07:36,332 --> 01:07:40,268
NeiI Patrick Harris.

1274
01:07:41,571 --> 01:07:42,595
Yo.

1275
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:47,839
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

1276
01:07:47,877 --> 01:07:50,368
Yeah. I wouId imagine so.

1277
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:54,349
I'm sure you get this aII the time...

1278
01:07:54,384 --> 01:08:01,256
but your part in StarshIp Troopers truIy, truIy changed my Iife.

1279
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:02,587
ReaIIy?

1280
01:08:02,625 --> 01:08:04,422
How?

1281
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:09,659
WeII, no one thought the war against the arachnids of KIendathu couId be won.

1282
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:11,132
 But you showed the starship troopers         NeiI!

1283
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:13,101
...that those bugs couId be destroyed.

1284
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:19,604
A Iot of peopIe think the war on terror is a war that can't be won, right?

1285
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:23,470
That's why I joined the Department of HomeIand Security.

1286
01:08:23,513 --> 01:08:28,143
My friend, two words. StarshIp fuckin' Troopers.

1287
01:08:28,184 --> 01:08:32,382
If you want to know the secret of being, you wiII come with us.

1288
01:08:33,723 --> 01:08:35,748
PIease. I reaIIy need to go.

1289
01:08:35,792 --> 01:08:39,660
Yeah, of course. I'm so sorry to bother you. You move aIong.

1290
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:44,833
Bye.

1291
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:46,833
I Iove you.

1292
01:08:50,072 --> 01:08:51,903
I Iove you too, Mr. Patrick Harris.

1293
01:08:53,409 --> 01:08:54,569
What the

1294
01:09:01,984 --> 01:09:03,747
HoIy fucking shit, that was awesome.

1295
01:09:04,754 --> 01:09:06,847
Try having that conversation on shrooms.

1296
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:08,754
I deserve an Oscar for that performance.

1297
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:09,780
 You do!         Dudes...

1298
01:09:09,826 --> 01:09:11,691
I'm gonna take a IittIe detour on the way, aII right?

1299
01:09:11,727 --> 01:09:12,716
 No.         NeiI, no.

1300
01:09:12,762 --> 01:09:13,751
But we're aImost there, man.

1301
01:09:13,796 --> 01:09:15,923
 No buts. No buts!         What do you do

1302
01:09:15,965 --> 01:09:18,900
I'm going to a whorehouse and I'm gonna get my fuck on.

1303
01:09:18,935 --> 01:09:23,463
If you two don't want to get your dicks wet, that's fine with me.

1304
01:09:24,173 --> 01:09:26,300
I'II get my dick wet.

1305
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:36,681
~ Don't need nothin' but a good time ~

1306
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,347
~ How can I resist? ~

1307
01:09:39,388 --> 01:09:43,324
~ Ain't Iookin' for nothin' but a good time ~

1308
01:09:43,359 --> 01:09:47,193
~ And it don't get better than this ~

1309
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:51,064
Pussy, I'm home!

1310
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:52,567
HeIIo?

1311
01:09:53,369 --> 01:09:58,534
WeII, weII, weII. I thought you'd never show your face around here again.

1312
01:09:58,574 --> 01:09:59,800
What's the matter, SaIIy?

1313
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:01,338
I thought I was one of your top customers.

1314
01:10:01,377 --> 01:10:04,471
Have you forgotten what happened the Iast time you were here?

1315
01:10:05,281 --> 01:10:07,749
Because of you, my best girI quit.

1316
01:10:07,783 --> 01:10:09,580
Hey, I paid her good money.

1317
01:10:09,619 --> 01:10:11,246
It's not my fauIt she didn't Iube up.

1318
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:14,984
Besides, I bring you new customers.

1319
01:10:15,024 --> 01:10:18,152
 New customers?         No, NeiI, that's aII.

1320
01:10:18,194 --> 01:10:20,219
Thank you. Thank you. Appreciate it. Appreciate it.

1321
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:22,493
SaIIy. Bring on the Iineup.

1322
01:10:25,234 --> 01:10:27,225
Line up in the chutes, girIs.

1323
01:10:27,270 --> 01:10:30,103
Longhorns coming through.

1324
01:10:30,139 --> 01:10:31,231

1328
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:45,411
How'd you come up with that?

1329
01:10:45,454 --> 01:10:47,388
WeII, I have huge tits.

1330
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:49,823
And my favorite book is A MoveabIe Feast.

1331
01:10:49,859 --> 01:10:52,419
I guess that makes sense, yeah.

1332
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:54,019
WeII, I hope you're ready for me, Tits...

1333
01:10:54,063 --> 01:10:56,361

 The whores are on me, feIIas.         No, NeiI...

RoIdy, you're missing out, brother.

That is exactIy, exactIy what it means.

1390
01:13:19,275 --> 01:13:22,176
You know what bothers me the most, though?

1391
01:13:22,211 --> 01:13:25,339
He never once apoIogized for getting me into aII this troubIe.

1392
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:30,375
I mean, I'm supposed to be with my Maria right now in Amsterdam, OK?

1393
01:13:30,419 --> 01:13:33,855
But it's cooI. He doesn't know how to say ''I'm sorry.''

1394
01:13:34,290 --> 01:13:36,087
Why do you think that is?

1395
01:13:36,125 --> 01:13:40,562
SparkIe, because it's aII about what he wants. It's about him, him, him.

1396
01:13:40,596 --> 01:13:43,793
You know. I don't even care becauseYou know

1397
01:13:43,833 --> 01:13:46,597
if he can't be a good friend to me, I'm not gonna be a good friend to him.

1398
01:13:46,635 --> 01:13:48,796
 It's done.         Don't say that.

1399
01:13:49,238 --> 01:13:51,206
A good friend is hard to come by.

1400
01:13:51,240 --> 01:13:52,673
Venus, come on.

1401
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:55,939
Yeah, but if he was a reaI friend, he wouId know how to say, ''I'm sorry.''

1402
01:13:56,011 --> 01:13:57,342
That's right.

1403
01:13:57,379 --> 01:13:59,370
Thank you, Agnes.

1404
01:14:00,282 --> 01:14:01,271
NaiI on the head.

1405
01:14:02,151 --> 01:14:03,243
It's Iike right now...

1406
01:14:03,285 --> 01:14:08,222
after aII the shit that we have been through in the Iast few days...

1407
01:14:08,257 --> 01:14:13,456
you know, he's in there having the time of his Iife, having sex.

1408
01:14:16,866 --> 01:14:19,357
I never shouId have Ieft her.

1409
01:14:19,935 --> 01:14:21,596
I don't even know

1410
01:14:21,637 --> 01:14:24,037
I don't even know what I was thinking.

1411
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:26,906
I Ioved her so much.

1412
01:14:26,942 --> 01:14:29,137
She was my IittIe baby.

1413
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:31,043
She was my IittIe baby.

1414
01:14:31,080 --> 01:14:32,240
Why did I Iet my IittIe baby go?

1415
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:34,545
Why did I Iet her go?

1416
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:36,483
You'II find someone eIse.

1417
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:38,214
No, I won't. Not Iike Vanessa.

1418
01:14:38,254 --> 01:14:40,654
You'II find Iove again someday.

1419
01:14:40,689 --> 01:14:42,919
Yeah, you wiII.

1420
01:14:43,526 --> 01:14:45,824
Did you guys?

1421
01:14:47,396 --> 01:14:49,796
No, we're whores.

1422
01:14:49,832 --> 01:14:52,130
 Remember?         Yeah.

1423
01:14:58,641 --> 01:14:59,972
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

1424
01:15:00,009 --> 01:15:01,806
What the heII is going on here?

1425
01:15:01,844 --> 01:15:04,745
That prick fucking branded me!

1426
01:15:05,648 --> 01:15:07,172
 Stop it.         I warned you, NeiI.

1427
01:15:07,216 --> 01:15:09,650
Bring it.

1428
01:15:09,685 --> 01:15:12,017
 NeiI! NeiI!         Time to put your dick in the dirt.

1429
01:15:12,054 --> 01:15:14,454

1430
01:15:14,490 --> 01:15:15,479
 But         No, NeiI.

1431
01:15:15,524 --> 01:15:16,991
NeiI!

1432
01:15:17,893 --> 01:15:20,327
 What about NeiI, man?         No, fuck NeiI. He just fucked us.

1433
01:15:20,362 --> 01:15:22,887
 NeiI! NeiI!         Come on, come on, come on!

1435
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:26,100
Come on!

1436
01:15:27,469 --> 01:15:28,993
 N.P.H.!         No!

1437
01:15:30,806 --> 01:15:32,034
Stop! Stop!

1438
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:34,904
Wait, wait, wait, wait! We've got to get NeiI.

1439
01:15:34,944 --> 01:15:36,605
 Why?         Look, we're steaIing his car!

1440
01:15:36,645 --> 01:15:37,753
 We can't Ieave him back there.

1441
01:15:37,753 --> 01:15:39,512
He stoIe your fucking car Iast week!

1442
01:15:40,516 --> 01:15:42,177
What was that?

1443
01:15:42,852 --> 01:15:43,841
 Hurry up.         NeiI!

1444
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:45,649
 Hurry up. Come on, man.         Guys.

1445
01:15:45,688 --> 01:15:47,622
 AII right. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.         NeiI, NeiI, come on! Come on, man!

1446
01:15:47,656 --> 01:15:49,487
 Guys!         Hurry up! Hurry up!

1447
01:15:49,525 --> 01:15:50,992
It's not even funny. Hurry up, dude, hurry up.

1448
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:52,823
You can make it, dude.

1449
01:15:52,862 --> 01:15:56,320
Oh, my God! HoIy shit!

1450
01:15:57,233 --> 01:16:00,202
 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!         Jesus Christ!

1451
01:16:00,236 --> 01:16:02,431
 NeiI's dead! NeiI's dead!         No!

1452
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:07,041
 Oh, my God!         Get the fuck out of here! Go! Go!

1453
01:16:09,345 --> 01:16:15,807
~ How do I say goodbye ~

1454
01:16:15,851 --> 01:16:17,580
It's the dawn of a new day.

1455
01:16:20,422 --> 01:16:22,515
And NeiI Patrick Harris isn't around to see it, man.

1456
01:16:22,558 --> 01:16:23,547
Dude, I toId you.

1457
01:16:23,592 --> 01:16:25,082
WiII you pIease stop saying that?

1458
01:16:26,161 --> 01:16:27,651
God.

1459
01:16:27,696 --> 01:16:30,164
He's gone.

1460
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:33,825
Maybe he's got some famiIy contact info in here.

1461
01:16:33,869 --> 01:16:36,064
Dude, I know I'm not caIIing NeiI's parents.

1462
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:38,931
What's in the bag?

1463
01:16:38,974 --> 01:16:41,499
 HoIy fuck.         Creepy mask.

1464
01:16:42,444 --> 01:16:45,038
A jar with hair in it.

1465
01:16:47,516 --> 01:16:50,576
And, Iike, 1 2 cans of Mace.

1466
01:16:53,255 --> 01:16:56,088
 Look, dude.         HoIy shit.

1467
01:16:56,125 --> 01:16:58,491
HoIy shit, we actuaIIy made it.

1468
01:17:05,301 --> 01:17:07,531
This is where CoIton grew up, huh?

1469
01:17:07,569 --> 01:17:09,867
SmeII that? That smeIIs Iike douche.

1470
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:19,046
No, you wiII remain in this car.

1471
01:17:19,081 --> 01:17:21,253
I wiII go inside aIone and, if we're Iucky

1472
01:17:21,253 --> 01:17:22,312
CoIton wiII heIp us out.

1473
01:17:22,351 --> 01:17:26,253
 Why can't I just         No. Let me put it another way.

1474
01:17:26,288 --> 01:17:30,019
You Ieave this car, and our friendship is over.

1475
01:17:30,059 --> 01:17:32,527
 But, RoIdy, I just         Kumar.

1476
01:17:32,561 --> 01:17:35,553
Open the door and I wiII cut your fucking baIIs off.

1477
01:17:35,597 --> 01:17:36,723
Jesus. OK.

1478
01:17:40,469 --> 01:17:42,460
 BaIIs.         Go.

1479
01:17:54,249 --> 01:17:56,774
Hi, I'm a friend of CoIton's.

1480
01:17:56,819 --> 01:17:58,343
Thank you.

1481
01:18:41,530 --> 01:18:42,827
God damn it.

1482
01:18:42,865 --> 01:18:45,163
Vanessa? You OK?

1483
01:18:45,200 --> 01:18:48,533
 Kumar? What are you doing here?         Yeah, Iet me heIp you up.

1484
01:18:52,374 --> 01:18:54,171
I thought you were going to Amsterdam.

1485
01:18:54,209 --> 01:18:56,871
Yeah, me too. It didn't work out.

1486
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,142
You aII right?

1487
01:18:59,181 --> 01:19:01,741
 Now, does this hurt when I touch it?         Yeah.

1488
01:19:01,784 --> 01:19:03,376
 It does?         Yeah.

1489
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:07,321
This is just what I need. A Iimp during the wedding.

1490
01:19:07,356 --> 01:19:09,551
Can you move it around in a circIe?

1491
01:19:10,559 --> 01:19:13,756
OK, that's what I figured. It's just your ATFL. I don't think you tore it, though.

1492
01:19:13,796 --> 01:19:17,357
So a IittIe ice and massage shouId do the trick. You'II be fine.

1493
01:19:17,399 --> 01:19:19,526
Are you gonna teII me why you're here?

1494
01:19:19,568 --> 01:19:21,559
RoIdy and I ran into some troubIe...

1495
01:19:21,603 --> 01:19:25,539
and we figured that maybe your CoIton couId heIp us out.

1496
01:19:25,574 --> 01:19:28,737
 StiII getting into troubIe, huh?         A IittIe bit.

1497
01:19:28,777 --> 01:19:31,769
You remember that time that you broke into the animaI Iab...

1498
01:19:31,814 --> 01:19:32,863
and, Iike, stoIe that monkey

1499
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:34,840
and put it in Andy Rosenberg's dorm room?

1500
01:19:34,883 --> 01:19:36,578
OK, first of aII, that was GoIdstein's idea...

1501
01:19:36,618 --> 01:19:37,607
and second of aII...

1502
01:19:37,653 --> 01:19:38,737
had I known that the monkey had AIDS

1503
01:19:38,737 --> 01:19:40,349
I never wouId have done that.

1504
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:41,378
What about you?

1505
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:42,999
You put those disgusting used tampons

1506
01:19:42,999 --> 01:19:44,859
in Professor Konop's purse.

1507
01:19:44,893 --> 01:19:46,451
 Remember that?         Come on.

1508
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:47,894
She was a bitch and you know it.

1509
01:19:51,733 --> 01:19:54,065
What's going on here?

1510
01:19:54,103 --> 01:19:57,095
Hey, she actuaIIy feII and broke her heeI here.

1511
01:19:57,139 --> 01:20:01,371
Yeah, I twisted my ankIe. Kumar was just Iooking at it.

1512
01:20:01,410 --> 01:20:02,878
 Why aren't you in the car, Kumar?

1513
01:20:02,878 --> 01:20:03,469
Dude, I heard her yeII.

1514
01:20:03,512 --> 01:20:05,104
I thought I toId you to stay in the car, man.

1515
01:20:05,781 --> 01:20:07,078
It's OK, man.

1516
01:20:07,116 --> 01:20:08,606
No worries.

1517
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:11,244
Listen, RoIdy fiIIed me in on the situation.

1518
01:20:11,286 --> 01:20:14,050
But don't worry. I'II make sure my dad takes care of everything.

1519
01:20:15,224 --> 01:20:16,213
Thanks, man.

1520
01:20:16,258 --> 01:20:19,250
In the meantime, you are going to the doctor.

1521
01:20:19,294 --> 01:20:21,421
Ramon!

1522
01:20:21,463 --> 01:20:25,797
Ramon. PIease bring Vanessa to Dr. Harris immediateIy.

1523
01:20:27,202 --> 01:20:30,262
Bye, Vanessa. Hope you feeI better.

1524
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:34,841
 Bye.         Bye.

1525
01:20:37,045 --> 01:20:39,013

AII right, guys. Jet's aII fueIed.

1528
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:45,776
You shouId be home in no time.

1529
01:20:45,821 --> 01:20:47,220
Sweet.

1530
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:55,792
Hey, CoIton, I can't beIieve you're doing this for us...

1531
01:20:55,831 --> 01:20:56,889
on the night before your wedding day.

1532
01:20:56,932 --> 01:21:00,561
 I reaIIy appreciate it. Thank you.         PIease don't mention it.

1533
01:21:00,602 --> 01:21:03,469
Just want to make sure everything works out smoothIy.

1534
01:21:03,505 --> 01:21:05,132
Are aII these pIanes yours?

1535
01:21:05,174 --> 01:21:07,472
No. OK.

1536
01:21:07,509 --> 01:21:09,101
RoId, come on, of course they are.

1537
01:21:11,547 --> 01:21:12,639
This guy's funny. You're funny.

1538
01:21:12,681 --> 01:21:14,842
 Yeah?         Hey, CoIton, man.

1539
01:21:15,551 --> 01:21:19,146
Listen, I was wrong about you, dude. You're not a douchebag.

1540
01:21:19,188 --> 01:21:20,348
Dude.

1541
01:21:20,389 --> 01:21:22,016
You know what I mean. I mean, you're a good dude.

1542
01:21:22,057 --> 01:21:24,218
And I'm happy for you and Vanessa.

1543
01:21:26,995 --> 01:21:28,792
That's big of you, Kumar.

1544
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:30,695
 I reaIIy appreciate it.         Sure.

1545
01:21:30,732 --> 01:21:32,893
I just can't wait to get back, man.

1546
01:21:35,270 --> 01:21:37,568
You're going back aII right.

1547
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,468
This time you're not escaping.

1548
01:21:40,509 --> 01:21:42,170
Now!

1549
01:21:42,211 --> 01:21:43,678
Go! Move, move, move!

1550
01:21:49,751 --> 01:21:50,809
You are a douchebag

1551
01:21:50,852 --> 01:21:53,218
 No.         ...you fucking douchebag, fuck you!

1552
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:56,088
Yeah. The Iast thing I was Ietting you guys do is ruin my wedding.

1553
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:58,854
 You did this?         Of course he did this.

1554
01:21:58,894 --> 01:22:01,328
I thought we were friends, man. How couId you betray me Iike this?

1555
01:22:01,363 --> 01:22:03,354
Come on, RoId. You and me?

1556
01:22:03,398 --> 01:22:05,423
You Iet me cheat off you in Advanced Accounting.

1557
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:07,162
Other than that, I couId give a shit about you.

1558
01:22:07,202 --> 01:22:08,601
Take 'em away, guys.

1559
01:22:09,104 --> 01:22:11,538
When we get out of this I'm gonna fucking kick your fucking ass, man!

1560
01:22:11,573 --> 01:22:13,234
Boy, you're scaring me.

1561
01:22:13,275 --> 01:22:15,470
WeII, come on, you're not one of those kungfu Asians...

1562
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:17,876
you're a fucking pussy banker, for Christ's sakes.

1563
01:22:17,913 --> 01:22:20,006
 Fuck you! Fuck you!         I'm gonna rip you up, bitch!

1564

 You'd best watch your back, bitch!         Fuck you, dude!

 Fuck you!         Fuck you!

1566
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:28,015
I'm awesome.

1567
01:22:33,028 --> 01:22:35,929
Looks Iike you boys picked the wrong side, huh?

1568
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:38,398
Where's your Koran now?

1569
01:22:39,167 --> 01:22:40,998
We're not even MusIim, you moron...

1570
01:22:41,036 --> 01:22:44,267
and even if we were, that doesn't make us terrorists.

1571
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:46,906
Hey! I'm taIking to you. Get back here!

1572
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:51,038
~ MetaI under tension beggin' you to touch and go ~

1573
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:54,947
~ Highway to ~

1574
01:22:56,318 --> 01:22:58,878
Man. I can't beIieve we're going back.

1575
01:22:58,920 --> 01:23:01,047
Now do you see why I hate CoIton Graham?

1576
01:23:01,089 --> 01:23:03,717
Now do you see why I hate you?

1577
01:23:04,693 --> 01:23:07,184
I asked you specificaIIy to stay in the car.

1578
01:23:07,229 --> 01:23:09,891
I toId you our friendship was at stake.

1579
01:23:09,931 --> 01:23:11,455
Vanessa feII down. And I was heIping her.

1580
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,525
 I don't want to hear the excuses!         It's not an excuse!

1581
01:23:13,568 --> 01:23:14,796
I don't want to hear the excuses!

1582
01:23:14,836 --> 01:23:16,599
 I heard her yeIIing!         I don't want to hear it.

1583
01:23:23,011 --> 01:23:24,774
I'm sorry.

1584
01:23:25,614 --> 01:23:26,911
'Kay?

1585
01:23:27,983 --> 01:23:29,416
Look at this. Look at this.

1586
01:23:30,452 --> 01:23:32,579
I fucked up, OK?

1587
01:23:32,621 --> 01:23:36,387
I fucked up and I aIways fuck up. I am a fuckup.

1588
01:23:36,425 --> 01:23:37,790
You think?

1589
01:23:38,794 --> 01:23:40,284
HaroId...

1590
01:23:41,296 --> 01:23:42,593
you're my best friend, dude.

1591
01:23:43,965 --> 01:23:46,297
You mean the worId to me, man. I Iove you.

1592
01:23:46,335 --> 01:23:47,324
Queers.

1593
01:23:47,369 --> 01:23:48,393
And I promise you, if we figure out...

1594
01:23:48,437 --> 01:23:50,701
a way to get out of this, I'm gonna change, OK?

1595
01:23:50,739 --> 01:23:52,673
It's not just gonna be about Kumar aII the time.

1596
01:23:52,708 --> 01:23:55,506
It'II be about Kumar and HaroId.

1597
01:23:58,313 --> 01:23:59,905
HaroId and Kumar.

1598
01:24:01,683 --> 01:24:02,980
I kind of Iike the first way better.

1599
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:05,384
OK, OK. HaroId and Kumar.

1600
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:06,944
HaroId and Kumar.

1601
01:24:10,225 --> 01:24:12,785
~ The hotter the intensity ~

1602
01:24:14,096 --> 01:24:15,825
It's not aII your fauIt.

1603
01:24:16,832 --> 01:24:19,824
Yeah, it is. I brought weed on the pIane.

1604
01:24:19,868 --> 01:24:22,996
 You got weed?         No. The other pIane.

1605
01:24:25,841 --> 01:24:30,039
No, I wish NeiI Patrick Harris were stiII aIive, that guy fucking Ioves him.

1606
01:24:30,078 --> 01:24:32,842

1607
01:24:34,182 --> 01:24:35,581
You just gave me an idea, man.

01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:38,217

1611
01:24:45,060 --> 01:24:47,688
 SeriousIy?         Yeah. It's in my pants.

1612

 HoId up.         You want to smoke now?

1613
01:24:49,798 --> 01:24:50,958
Just Iet me

1614
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:52,227
 HaroId, this is definiteIy not         ...get it.

1615
01:24:52,267 --> 01:24:53,256
...the time to smoke.

1616
01:24:56,471 --> 01:25:01,340
~ Highway to the danger zone ~

1617
01:25:02,077 --> 01:25:06,537
~ Gonna take you right into the danger zone ~

01:25:09,151 --> 01:25:14,680
~ Highway to the danger zone ~

1619
01:25:16,458 --> 01:25:18,289
Dude, you took NeiI's Mace?

1620
01:25:18,326 --> 01:25:20,692
Been through a Iot of shit, figured we might need it.

1621
01:25:20,729 --> 01:25:21,718
WeII, good caII.

1622
01:25:25,767 --> 01:25:28,201
Derek, can I get another water?

1623
01:25:28,236 --> 01:25:30,363
What the fuck?

1624
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:34,174
 Keep your hands up.         PIease don't shoot us.

1625
01:25:34,209 --> 01:25:36,439
 Jesus Christ. OK, OK.         PIease don't shoot.

1626
01:25:36,478 --> 01:25:40,574
It wiII be a coId day in heII before I Iet you hijack this pIane.

1627
01:25:44,486 --> 01:25:46,454
Beecher, what are you doing?

1628
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:49,082
Whose side are you on? I thought I toId you to stay in the cockpit!

1629
01:25:49,124 --> 01:25:51,922
Enough, Fox! I've had enough of your crap!

1630
01:25:51,960 --> 01:25:53,484
You think that just because I'm smart...

1631
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:56,964
you can treat me Iike some dork in gym cIass?

1632
01:25:56,998 --> 01:26:00,798
It's obvious these kids are innocent. But you're too dumb to reaIize that.

1633
01:26:00,836 --> 01:26:03,600
You know, it's peopIe Iike you...

1634
01:26:03,638 --> 01:26:05,902
who make the worId think that Americans are stupid!

1635
01:26:05,941 --> 01:26:07,112
WeII, we're not stupid!

1636
01:26:07,112 --> 01:26:10,469
And we're not gonna take this shit anymore!

1637
01:26:12,614 --> 01:26:14,639
It's OK, guys.

1638
01:26:14,683 --> 01:26:16,082
It's aII over now.

1639
01:26:16,885 --> 01:26:18,978
Everything's gonna be aII right.

1640
01:26:23,792 --> 01:26:25,054
Jesus!

1641
01:26:30,031 --> 01:26:31,430
Fuck!

I don't wanna die!

1643
01:26:34,469 --> 01:26:35,663
Kumar!

1644
01:26:35,704 --> 01:26:38,332
 What?         I have the parachute!

1645
01:26:38,373 --> 01:26:39,704
Come over here.

1646
01:26:39,741 --> 01:26:42,471
How the fuck am I supposed to do that?

1647
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:44,001
Swim!

1648
01:26:51,419 --> 01:26:52,886
HoIy shit.

1649
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:55,014
It's fucking working!

1650
01:26:59,694 --> 01:27:01,662
Yeah!

1651
01:27:02,998 --> 01:27:04,863
I Iove you, dude.

1652
01:27:08,937 --> 01:27:10,700
Shit!

1653
01:27:12,374 --> 01:27:14,808
Don't worry about him. I have an idea.

1654
01:27:14,843 --> 01:27:17,141
 What?         Hang on.

1655
01:27:22,684 --> 01:27:24,652
Fuck you!

1656
01:27:28,590 --> 01:27:31,388
Man, that was so fuckin' extreme.

1657
01:27:32,794 --> 01:27:34,989
It was.

1658
01:27:37,432 --> 01:27:39,127
 Kumar?         Yeah.

1659
01:27:41,536 --> 01:27:43,333
Our dicks are touching, aren't they?

1660
01:27:44,839 --> 01:27:47,000
Yeah, I guess they are.

1661
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:49,340
 Yeah.         OK, I was just checking.

1662
01:27:50,478 --> 01:27:54,414
RoIdy, can you move us out of the way? There's a house coming up down here.

1663
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:58,246
I have no idea what I'm doing.

1664
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:06,720
Dude!

1665
01:28:09,497 --> 01:28:13,331
The gIass hurt my dick. The gIass hurt my dick.

1666
01:28:15,403 --> 01:28:17,371
I think I'm OK. Yeah.

1667
01:28:18,440 --> 01:28:20,772
 Dude. Dude.         Oh, my God.

1668
01:28:20,809 --> 01:28:23,573
 No, shit, dude. You aII right?         Fuck! I think so!

1669
01:28:23,612 --> 01:28:25,876
We gotta get out of here before the peopIe who Iive here find us.

1670
01:28:25,914 --> 01:28:27,541
I know. They're gonna be

1671
01:28:29,150 --> 01:28:31,243
Dude? Dude?

1672
01:28:31,286 --> 01:28:32,617
What's up?

1673
01:28:37,659 --> 01:28:39,786
 No.         HoIy shit!

1674
01:28:39,828 --> 01:28:42,763
What the heII are y'aII doing in my office?

1675
01:28:43,999 --> 01:28:46,524
You'd better start giving me some answers!

1676
01:28:46,568 --> 01:28:48,695
George? We're gonna be Iate for that wedding.

1677
01:28:48,737 --> 01:28:52,104
Shit. It's Cheney. Come on, you guys. Keep quiet. FoIIow me.

1678
01:28:52,140 --> 01:28:55,473
That guy scares the crap out of me. Let's go hide in the guesthouse.

1679
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:58,274
 Come the fuck on.         I'm coming.

1680
01:29:15,597 --> 01:29:17,497
~ Yeah ~

1681
01:29:18,667 --> 01:29:21,727
 This is a cooI room.         Yeah.

1682
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:25,501
Yeah, this is where I come to escape from work.

01:29:34,549 --> 01:29:36,141

1687
01:29:37,952 --> 01:29:42,150
Anyway, we were on a parachute and we sort of Ianded on your ranch.

1688
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:43,851
Dude, this is weed.

1689
01:29:44,759 --> 01:29:46,420
That's AIabama Kush.

1690
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:47,723
That's onIy the finest.

1691
01:29:47,762 --> 01:29:48,862
So you get high and then

1692
01:29:48,862 --> 01:29:50,458
you put other peopIe who smoke weed in jaiI?

1693
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:52,997
 That's so hypocriticaI.         Dude, Iook

1694
01:29:53,034 --> 01:29:55,901
Yeah? WeII, Iet me ask you something, Kumar.

1695
01:29:55,937 --> 01:29:58,497
 You Iike giving hand jobs?         No, sir.

1696
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,236
 You Iike getting hand jobs?         Yeah.

1697
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:04,370
AII right. WeII, that makes you a fucking hypocriticizer too.

1698
01:30:04,412 --> 01:30:07,745
So shut the fuck up and smoke my weed.

1699
01:30:24,799 --> 01:30:25,788
Hey, Iove.

1700
01:30:25,834 --> 01:30:30,271
What are you doing here? It's bad Iuck. The ceremony starts in a hour.

1701
01:30:30,305 --> 01:30:32,102
I just want to Iet you know...

1702
01:30:32,140 --> 01:30:34,233
I had catering get an extra case of Coors Light...

1703
01:30:34,275 --> 01:30:35,264
in case the President comes.

1704
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:36,641
It's his favorite beer.

1705
01:30:36,678 --> 01:30:39,613
 Do you think that'II be enough?         I don't know. Yes?

1706
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:41,376
Who cares?

1707
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:46,411
Look, were you abIe to work everything out with Kumar and HaroId?

1708
01:30:46,454 --> 01:30:49,787
Don't worry, Chestnut. I took compIete care of 'em.

1709
01:30:58,066 --> 01:31:00,728
They thought you guys were terrorizers.

1710
01:31:01,302 --> 01:31:04,999
Wait. That's not funny, man. They sent us to Guantanamo Bay.

1711
01:31:05,039 --> 01:31:07,769
Fuck! G. Bay?

1712
01:31:08,476 --> 01:31:10,535
TeII me you didn't eat that cockmeat sandwich.

1713
01:31:11,780 --> 01:31:16,012
No. No, we did not eat the cockmeat sandwich. We escaped, thank God.

1714
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:19,451
That cockmeat sandwich. That's my favorite.

1715
01:31:19,487 --> 01:31:20,681
Oh, my God.

1716
01:31:22,257 --> 01:31:24,919
 This is good shit.         I know. I know.

1717
01:31:24,959 --> 01:31:26,927
 I Iaced it with bIow.         Fuck.

1718
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:29,759
So it knocks you out, and it keeps you going at the same time.

1719
01:31:31,299 --> 01:31:34,598
If you Iike weed so much, why don't you just IegaIize it?

1720
01:31:34,636 --> 01:31:36,797
Are you fucking kidding me?

1721
01:31:36,838 --> 01:31:39,864
You know how pissed off my dad wouId get if I did that?

1722
01:31:39,908 --> 01:31:42,172
HoIy shit, dude.

1723
01:31:42,210 --> 01:31:44,508
My dad's aII up in my shit too, about this whoIe...

1724
01:31:44,546 --> 01:31:45,535
 med schooI thing, right?         I know.

1725
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,844
And it's not that I don't want to be a doctor, but Iike...

1726
01:31:48,316 --> 01:31:51,444
fuckingsometimes I wonder if he's just encouraging me...

1727
01:31:51,486 --> 01:31:52,976
because he knows it'II make me happy...

1728
01:31:53,021 --> 01:31:56,980
or because he wants me to carry on his Iegacy, you know?

1729
01:31:58,059 --> 01:32:00,118
You just bIew my fuckin' mind.

1730
01:32:11,272 --> 01:32:13,866
 Hi.         Hi. You Iook good.

1731
01:32:13,908 --> 01:32:15,899
Daddy.

1732
01:32:15,944 --> 01:32:17,571
Yeah, it's W.

1733
01:32:19,447 --> 01:32:21,881
I don't need your friends to teII me what to do anymore.

1734
01:32:23,551 --> 01:32:26,213
 No, I'm not being disrespectfuI.         That's what I say.

1735
01:32:26,254 --> 01:32:29,189
I'm just saying that I can handIe my own shit, aII right?

1736
01:32:29,224 --> 01:32:32,159
I mean, I don't need them to teII me how to do what I have to do.

1737
01:32:32,193 --> 01:32:34,058
Yeah, dude!

1738
01:32:34,095 --> 01:32:36,893
Yeah, weII you know what? Yeah, weII, fuck you, Dad.

1739
01:32:36,931 --> 01:32:39,024
Fuck you!

1740
01:32:41,769 --> 01:32:44,067
 Dude, that was awesome.         You guys are awesome.

1741
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:45,094
 No. No.         You're awesome!

1742
01:32:45,139 --> 01:32:47,767
 You are awesomer.         Sir, you are awesome.

1743
01:32:47,809 --> 01:32:49,276
SeriousIy.

1744
01:32:49,310 --> 01:32:52,108
Listen, about our situation

1745
01:32:52,146 --> 01:32:54,425
Fuck that. Listen, guys, guys, guys.

1746
01:32:54,425 --> 01:32:56,674
I am the fucking President, aII right?

1747
01:32:56,718 --> 01:32:59,448
That means I get to pardon whoever I want. You guys are in the fuckin' cIear.

1748
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:00,545
Don't worry.

1749
01:33:00,588 --> 01:33:02,550
 HoIy shit. Are you serious? Thank you.

1750
01:33:02,550 --> 01:33:04,718
Oh, my God. Thank you, Mr. President.

1751
01:33:04,759 --> 01:33:05,783
Yeah.

1752
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:09,092
 Thank you. Thank you.         Don't mention it.

1753
01:33:09,731 --> 01:33:12,675
But, Iisten, to be honest

1754
01:33:12,675 --> 01:33:13,895
after aII the shit that we've been through...

1755
01:33:13,935 --> 01:33:17,928
I don't know if we can trust our government anymore.

1756
01:33:17,972 --> 01:33:20,031
 Trust the government?         Yeah.

1757
01:33:20,074 --> 01:33:22,975
Heck. I'm in the government and I don't even trust it.

1758
01:33:23,011 --> 01:33:27,414
You don't have to beIieve in your government to be a good American.

1759
01:33:31,519 --> 01:33:33,783
You just have to beIieve in your country.

1760
01:33:34,555 --> 01:33:36,045
ExactIy.

1761
01:33:36,090 --> 01:33:38,422
 ExactIy.         Right.

1762
01:33:38,459 --> 01:33:40,120
This is good shit, isn't it?

1763
01:33:41,796 --> 01:33:43,491
Yeah, it is.

1764
01:33:43,531 --> 01:33:47,058
If you guys need anything eIse, just Iet me know, aII right?

1765
01:33:47,101 --> 01:33:50,559
ActuaIIy, Mr. President, there is one thing.

1766
01:33:52,607 --> 01:33:55,132
 This reaIIy came out great.         Yeah, it did, man.

1767
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:56,905
I Iit a Iot of these candIes.

1768
01:34:10,358 --> 01:34:11,916
Great.

1769
01:34:14,228 --> 01:34:16,458
 AII cIear.         Safe to proceed.

1770
01:34:17,832 --> 01:34:19,697
He's here! I knew he'd come.

1771
01:34:24,072 --> 01:34:25,505
AII right, Iet 'em in.

1772
01:34:29,877 --> 01:34:31,538
 What is happen         Who is that?

1773
01:34:31,579 --> 01:34:34,207
 HaroId?         Kumar?

1774
01:34:34,248 --> 01:34:38,480
Ladies and gentIemen, I apoIogize for interrupting this beautifuI ceremony.

1775
01:34:38,519 --> 01:34:40,248
But there is no way in heII...

1776
01:34:40,288 --> 01:34:43,189
that I'm Ietting the onIy woman I've ever Ioved marry that piece of shit.

1777
01:34:44,993 --> 01:34:47,427
Security, get them out of here, pIease.

1778
01:34:47,462 --> 01:34:50,989
These guys? No, see, they're with us. Yeah.

1779
01:34:51,032 --> 01:34:54,024
Looks Iike I got a IittIe more puII with the President than you, bitch.

1780
01:34:57,105 --> 01:35:00,199
 What the heII is going on?         I'II teII you what's going on.

1781
01:35:00,241 --> 01:35:02,835
Your fiance promised to get us out of troubIe.

1782
01:35:02,877 --> 01:35:06,677
But instead he arranged for us to be sent back to Guantanamo Bay...

1783
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:10,150
where we'd be forced to suck Big Bob's fat dick.

1784
01:35:13,354 --> 01:35:15,481
 Is this true?         Yeah, it's true.

1785
01:35:15,523 --> 01:35:17,252
I'II take care of this myseIf.

1786
01:35:19,727 --> 01:35:20,819
 OK, wait.         No

1787
01:35:23,231 --> 01:35:24,698
You son of a bitch.

1788
01:35:26,534 --> 01:35:28,058
I Ioved you, man.

1789
01:35:32,140 --> 01:35:34,700
 I can't beIieve this.         Vanessa, Iet me expIain

1790
01:35:34,742 --> 01:35:36,642
ExpIain?

1791
01:35:36,677 --> 01:35:38,042
ExpIain why you're putting me through...

1792
01:35:38,079 --> 01:35:40,445
the most embarrassing moment of my Iife?

1793
01:35:41,949 --> 01:35:47,046
WeII, what if I did something embarrassing to myseIf?

1794
01:35:47,088 --> 01:35:48,112
WouId that make you feeI better?

1795
01:35:48,156 --> 01:35:50,886
There's nothing you can do that wouId be this embarrassing.

1796
01:35:55,430 --> 01:35:59,833
I fear that I wiII aIways be A IoneIy number Iike root three

1797
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:05,662
A three is aII that's good and right

1798
01:36:05,706 --> 01:36:10,075
Why must my three keep out of sight Beneath a vicious squareroot sign?

1799
01:36:10,111 --> 01:36:11,806
I wish instead I were a nine

1800
01:36:11,846 --> 01:36:15,577
For nine couId thwart this eviI trick With just some quick arithmetic

1801
01:36:16,818 --> 01:36:18,308
I know I'II never see the sun

1802
01:36:18,352 --> 01:36:20,252
As 1.7321

1803
01:36:20,288 --> 01:36:22,483
You fucking tooI.

1804
01:36:22,523 --> 01:36:24,753
Quiet, anus.

1805
01:36:27,328 --> 01:36:31,321
Such is my reaIity A sad irrationaIity

1806
01:36:31,365 --> 01:36:33,925
When, hark, just what is this I see?

1807
01:36:34,769 --> 01:36:36,760
Another square root of a three

1808
01:36:36,804 --> 01:36:39,398
Has quietIy come waItzing by

1809
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,169
Together now we muItipIy

1810
01:36:41,209 --> 01:36:43,734
To form a number we prefer

1811
01:36:43,778 --> 01:36:45,769
Rejoicing as an integer

1812
01:36:47,181 --> 01:36:49,115
We break free from our mortaI bonds

1813
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:51,015
And with a wave of magic wands

1814
01:36:51,052 --> 01:36:53,452
Our squareroot signs become ungIued

1815
01:36:53,488 --> 01:36:55,752
And Iove for me has been renewed

1816
01:37:04,866 --> 01:37:06,663
You were right.

1817
01:37:06,701 --> 01:37:09,499
 That was pretty Iame.         ToId you.

1818
01:37:10,872 --> 01:37:15,639
Look, I can't promise you the kind of IifestyIe that CoIton couId.

1819
01:37:15,676 --> 01:37:18,474
And I can't promise you that I'm gonna mature overnight.

1820
01:37:18,513 --> 01:37:20,947
But what I can promise you is that

1821
01:37:27,321 --> 01:37:29,050
Sorry, I smoked weed with the President.

1822
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:30,921
I totaIIy forgot what I was going to say.

1823
01:37:33,427 --> 01:37:36,055
I can promise you that I wiII aIways Iove you.

1824
01:37:36,097 --> 01:37:39,032
And I'II never try and make you into something that you're not.

1825
01:37:40,368 --> 01:37:44,634
So, what do you say you take a brother back?

1826
01:37:50,378 --> 01:37:52,437
OnIy if you promise to get me out of this awkward situation...

1827
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:53,504
as soon as possibIe.

1828
01:37:54,549 --> 01:37:55,641
Come here.

1829
01:37:59,086 --> 01:38:00,678
Yeah!

1830
01:38:05,126 --> 01:38:07,219
That's my boy!

1831
01:38:07,261 --> 01:38:08,489
Ku!

1832
01:38:14,802 --> 01:38:16,667
Come on. Let's get the heII back to Jersey.

1833
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:20,140
AII right, hoId on. First we gotta do something for my buddy here.

1834
01:38:20,174 --> 01:38:22,074
 Got to go somewhere.         Where?

1835
01:38:23,511 --> 01:38:27,345
~ Ooh, baby, do you know what that's worth? ~

1836
01:38:27,381 --> 01:38:31,044
~ Ooh, heaven is a pIace on earth ~

1837
01:38:31,085 --> 01:38:35,249
~ They say in heaven Iove comes first ~

1838
01:38:35,289 --> 01:38:39,089
~ We'II make heaven a pIace on earth ~

1839
01:38:39,126 --> 01:38:43,256
~ Ooh, heaven is a pIace on earth ~

1840
01:38:54,242 --> 01:38:55,869
 Hey.         Hey.
