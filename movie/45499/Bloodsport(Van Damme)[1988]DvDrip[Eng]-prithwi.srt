1
00:02:06,468 --> 00:02:09,086
Jackson, you going to go to Hong Kong?

2
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:12,482
I love anything full-contact.
I need a few more scars on my face.

3
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,370
I heard you can get killed at that kumite.

4
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:16,126
Only if you fuck up.

5
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:30,048
Tomorrow we leave for the kumite.

6
00:02:49,314 --> 00:02:50,329
Sir?

7
00:02:51,747 --> 00:02:52,990
Excuse me.

8
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:55,545
Col. Cooke would like to see you
before you leave.

9
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:57,275
What's the problem?

10
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:01,115
He found out you're going to Hong Kong.
He wants to talk to you about it.

11
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:04,316
Tell him I'll be right there
after I take a shower.

12
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:06,489
But I'll have to wait, sir.

13
00:03:06,688 --> 00:03:07,736
Okay.

14
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:14,428
What's taking so long, Captain?

15
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:17,306
Captain?

16
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:28,823
Shit!

17
00:03:47,071 --> 00:03:48,087
Sir!

18
00:03:48,574 --> 00:03:49,622
Where's Dux?

19
00:03:49,727 --> 00:03:51,188
He was at the gym, like you said.

20
00:03:51,262 --> 00:03:53,367
He took a shower,
l waited, and he disappeared.

21
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:54,747
What do you mean, disappeared?

22
00:03:54,815 --> 00:03:56,571
One minute he's there, then gone.

23
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:59,574
Jesus Christ!
If anything happens to Dux in Hong Kong...

24
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,501
Get Helmer and Rawlins
on this right away.

25
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:04,534
And I don't want to see your face again
until Dux is beside it!

26
00:04:04,606 --> 00:04:05,403
Understand?

27
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:25,106
How is he?

28
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,147
He's resting now.
He'll be so happy to see you.

29
00:04:28,414 --> 00:04:30,551
It's so good to be here again.

30
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:36,180
I'll tell him you are here.

31
00:04:36,285 --> 00:04:37,561
Thank you.

32
00:04:57,212 --> 00:04:58,870
Look at the sword!

33
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,163
Let's get it.

34
00:05:06,235 --> 00:05:08,985
Come on, Frank.
What's the matter, you chicken?

35
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:10,839
- No.
- Then get in here.

36
00:05:11,195 --> 00:05:14,130
Frank, you want to hang out with us,
then come on!

37
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,178
You just going to stand there,
or are you going to grab something?

38
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:23,098
Shit! They're coming back!
Let's get out of here!

39
00:05:23,162 --> 00:05:24,569
Come on, Frank!

40
00:05:24,634 --> 00:05:26,424
Forget him! Let's go!

41
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:46,006
That's enough, Shingo.

42
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,732
Go to your studies.

43
00:05:57,369 --> 00:05:59,987
You cannot get katana sword by stealing.

44
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,248
It is a very special sword.

45
00:06:05,017 --> 00:06:06,577
You must earn it.

46
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:08,879
I wasn't going to steal it.

47
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,069
You didn't flinch. You have fighting spirit.

48
00:06:17,496 --> 00:06:19,700
You're not gonna call the cops?

49
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:21,813
Not if we make a deal.

50
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,891
What kind of a deal?

51
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,837
Your son and my son
are in the same school.

52
00:06:27,832 --> 00:06:29,872
Frank sees my son's skill...

53
00:06:30,775 --> 00:06:33,743
...and he desires
to learn martial science, too.

54
00:06:34,071 --> 00:06:36,886
Yes, but what do you mean
by martial science?

55
00:06:38,487 --> 00:06:42,164
Frank has told me
you came to America to grow vines.

56
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:44,949
Yes, that's right.
I work at the Verne vineyard.

57
00:06:45,015 --> 00:06:47,633
I came here to grow fish in my hatchery.

58
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:50,963
We both grow children.

59
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:53,809
You use science
to make vines grow better.

60
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,424
Like vines, children need training.

61
00:06:58,454 --> 00:07:01,236
Martial science provides a way of training.

62
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,683
It brings mind, body, spirit together.

63
00:07:11,093 --> 00:07:13,515
That's enough. That's all for today.

64
00:07:13,717 --> 00:07:14,894
Not yet.

65
00:07:15,317 --> 00:07:17,455
Why don't you quit, round-eye?

66
00:07:18,388 --> 00:07:19,566
Not yet.

67
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:23,091
Go practice your katas.

68
00:07:24,788 --> 00:07:27,177
How come you coach him, but not me?

69
00:07:27,636 --> 00:07:29,577
I brought you here
to help me train my son.

70
00:07:29,652 --> 00:07:30,798
Don't question me!

71
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:34,251
If you expect me to be his punching bag,
you can forget about our deal.

72
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:58,257
Someday...

73
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:02,096
...I'll fight in the kumite
and make my father proud.

74
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,141
Shidoshi, I feel like
I've lost part of my family, too.

75
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:21,162
Shingo and I were close friends,
like brothers.

76
00:08:21,618 --> 00:08:23,788
And you and Mrs. Tanaka...

77
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,439
...have treated me like a son.

78
00:08:32,658 --> 00:08:33,769
What will happen now?

79
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:37,290
No more training.

80
00:08:37,586 --> 00:08:38,894
I stop now.

81
00:08:44,017 --> 00:08:46,156
But you have so much to teach.

82
00:08:48,016 --> 00:08:49,739
You don't understand.

83
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,351
In the war, I lost my first family...

84
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:58,094
...my son, daughter, and wife.

85
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:03,376
They lived in Hiroshima.

86
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:08,972
I left Japan because of the war.

87
00:09:10,095 --> 00:09:11,502
War was wrong.

88
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,238
I came here to start over...

89
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,919
...begin a new family, have a son...

90
00:09:20,206 --> 00:09:22,923
...another chance to pass on the teaching.

91
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,704
For 2,000 years...

92
00:09:26,895 --> 00:09:29,578
...knowledge passed from father to son...

93
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,303
...father to son.

94
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,489
When Shingo died...

95
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:39,076
...it stopped.

96
00:09:42,509 --> 00:09:45,029
Teach me. I can do it.

97
00:09:45,806 --> 00:09:48,523
You are not Japanese!
You are not a Tanaka!

98
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:51,876
You taught me
using any technique that works...

99
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:55,144
...never to limit myself to one style...

100
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,549
...to keep an open mind!

101
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,140
Why?

102
00:10:00,909 --> 00:10:03,627
To honor you, Shidoshi.

103
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,794
Practice until you can meditate...

104
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,196
...and nothing can distract you...

105
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,333
...so that you see and feel nothing...

106
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:00,347
...except your own energy.

107
00:16:06,908 --> 00:16:08,795
Are you awake, Shidoshi?

108
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,792
Do you sleep with your eyes open?

109
00:16:13,115 --> 00:16:14,806
How are you feeling?

110
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,807
Like an old man.

111
00:16:20,475 --> 00:16:22,068
And how about you?

112
00:16:24,635 --> 00:16:26,456
I'm going to Hong Kong.

113
00:16:26,874 --> 00:16:28,978
You sure you want to do this?

114
00:16:29,402 --> 00:16:33,776
To honor you means everything to me.

115
00:16:35,417 --> 00:16:38,035
I have poured all my knowledge into you.

116
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:43,126
When you fight, my spirit fights with you.

117
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:46,929
In kumite, you will need it.

118
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:27,244
Hey, babe,
want to go out with a real big man?

119
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:28,977
No, huh?

120
00:17:35,703 --> 00:17:37,742
Too handsome for you, honey?

121
00:17:43,063 --> 00:17:45,551
Is this your first time in Hong Kong?

122
00:17:45,878 --> 00:17:48,529
You two are here for the kumite,
aren't you?

123
00:17:48,598 --> 00:17:50,801
Kumite? What is kumite?

124
00:17:52,278 --> 00:17:55,377
Look, guys,
l know there's a secret full-contact event...

125
00:17:55,446 --> 00:17:57,813
...being held in Hong Kong
in the next few days.

126
00:17:57,878 --> 00:18:00,299
Yes. Hong Kong is an exciting city.

127
00:18:00,917 --> 00:18:04,813
I also happen to know a little bit
about some of your competition.

128
00:18:06,038 --> 00:18:07,085
Okay.

129
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,018
Would you just tell me
how you got invited?

130
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:16,723
Thanks, guys.

131
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,009
What? Think you can
give me some competition?

132
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:29,962
Sure. I'll try.

133
00:18:30,836 --> 00:18:34,284
That's what I like to hear,
a kid who isn't afraid to lose.

134
00:18:34,356 --> 00:18:36,745
No, I got it.
I don't want to take your money.

135
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,300
- You ready?
- Yeah.

136
00:19:07,345 --> 00:19:09,866
- You like this kind of fighting?
- Yeah.

137
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:13,902
If you want to see some real fighting,
you can see me fight at the kumite.

138
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:16,109
I'm here, too, for the kumite.

139
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:19,274
Aren't you a little young for full-contact?

140
00:19:19,345 --> 00:19:21,963
Aren’t you a little old for video games?

141
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,738
- You want to go at it again, huh?
- Yeah.

142
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,548
Not bad, kid. Name's Ray Jackson.

143
00:19:41,616 --> 00:19:42,794
I'm Frank Dux.

144
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,202
Mrs. Tanaka...

145
00:19:52,272 --> 00:19:53,678
Mrs. Tanaka?

146
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:54,759
Yes?

147
00:19:54,831 --> 00:19:58,029
It's very important
to the government of the United States...

148
00:19:58,097 --> 00:19:59,787
...that we find Frank Dux.

149
00:19:59,856 --> 00:20:03,499
We understand that
he might have visited Mr. Tanaka recently.

150
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:05,739
Mr. Tanaka is very ill.

151
00:20:06,095 --> 00:20:08,006
We're sorry to hear that.

152
00:20:08,655 --> 00:20:10,412
Was Frank here recently?

153
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,901
Frank came here to pay his respects.

154
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:15,271
- When was that?
- Two days ago.

155
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:18,725
Did he say, or do you know
if he was going to Hong Kong?

156
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:20,973
I don't know.

157
00:20:21,135 --> 00:20:23,076
Of course you know. We're not trying to...

158
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,314
Mrs. Tanaka,
we're very sorry to have disturbed you.

159
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:29,229
Thank you very much for your time.

160
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,192
- May I help you?
- Yeah, how you doing?

161
00:20:37,263 --> 00:20:39,204
My name's Jackson. This is Mr. Frank Dux.

162
00:20:39,278 --> 00:20:40,226
Are our rooms ready?

163
00:20:40,301 --> 00:20:43,879
Mr. Lin in Room 310 wants to see you
after you check in.

164
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:46,056
Who the hell's Mr. Lin?

165
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:49,322
I'm Lin. You Jackson?
You look like a Jackson.

166
00:20:52,046 --> 00:20:53,801
That would make you Frank Ducks.

167
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,073
No, no. It's Dux.

168
00:20:56,461 --> 00:20:59,145
Gotcha. Like "Put up your dukes," right?

169
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:00,838
Okay, so here's the deal.

170
00:21:00,909 --> 00:21:02,982
This is the biggest kumite ever.

171
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,157
We got fighters from all over.

172
00:21:05,228 --> 00:21:06,985
I've been assigned by the IFAA...

173
00:21:07,053 --> 00:21:09,572
...to help you
and the other North American fighters...

174
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,500
...to find your way around.

175
00:21:11,565 --> 00:21:14,216
I'm gonna make sure
you guys give it your best.

176
00:21:14,285 --> 00:21:16,554
And don't disqualify by fighting
outside the arena.

177
00:21:17,964 --> 00:21:20,353
The Triad, they are like the Mafia...

178
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:23,811
...is allowing us
to hold kumite here this time.

179
00:21:27,468 --> 00:21:29,889
Here it comes, man, the Walled City.

180
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:32,160
Not a place for outsiders.

181
00:21:32,332 --> 00:21:33,925
You are in Hong Kong.

182
00:21:33,996 --> 00:21:37,956
But you are about to cross
an invisible border into mainland China.

183
00:21:38,187 --> 00:21:39,332
No joke, man.

184
00:21:39,402 --> 00:21:41,378
It's a run-down piece of no-mars-land...

185
00:21:41,451 --> 00:21:43,524
...in the middle of a tourist paradise.

186
00:21:43,596 --> 00:21:47,489
It goes back to the old lease agreement
between Great Britain and China.

187
00:21:47,562 --> 00:21:50,978
Once you step out of the sunlight
into the narrow corridors...

188
00:21:51,051 --> 00:21:53,669
...it's time to protect your nuts, guys.

189
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:05,414
Okay, USA!

190
00:22:07,434 --> 00:22:08,709
"Okay, USA!"

191
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:13,952
Okay, guys.

192
00:24:14,178 --> 00:24:17,594
First, you'll show the Black Dragon boys
your invitation.

193
00:24:17,859 --> 00:24:20,958
Then you got to qualify
and prove to them...

194
00:24:21,028 --> 00:24:23,874
...you can step onto the runway
and not get killed.

195
00:24:23,938 --> 00:24:25,084
Got it?

196
00:24:26,114 --> 00:24:27,424
You got it?

197
00:24:45,794 --> 00:24:48,543
It says he represents the Tanaka clan.

198
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:52,128
You don't look like Tanaka.

199
00:24:52,193 --> 00:24:54,201
Shidoshi Tanaka trained me.

200
00:24:54,434 --> 00:24:55,611
What's the hold up?

201
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:58,681
He says Senzo Tanaka is his Shidoshi.

202
00:24:59,137 --> 00:25:02,334
What's the difference
if Bruce Springsteen is his Shidoshi?

203
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:04,889
If Senzo Tanaka is his Shidoshi...

204
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,161
...then show us the dim mak.

205
00:25:07,425 --> 00:25:09,431
What the hell is a dim mak?

206
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:11,550
Death touch.

207
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:20,825
Thanks.

208
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,866
Vic, choose a brick.

209
00:25:25,375 --> 00:25:26,717
Okay, Frank.

210
00:25:28,416 --> 00:25:30,106
What about this one?

211
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:38,198
No!

212
00:25:40,991 --> 00:25:42,299
Bottom one.

213
00:26:21,022 --> 00:26:22,483
Son of a bitch!

214
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:24,692
Is that good enough, guys?

215
00:26:25,565 --> 00:26:27,474
We honor your invitation.

216
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:30,203
No shit, you honor his invitation!

217
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:33,491
That was great.

218
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:44,407
Very good, but brick not hit back.

219
00:27:02,362 --> 00:27:05,014
Here's a picture
of the man we're looking for.

220
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:07,352
His name is Frank Dux.

221
00:27:08,538 --> 00:27:11,767
We have reason to believe
Frank is here in Hong Kong.

222
00:27:12,026 --> 00:27:13,620
His name was on a list...

223
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,861
...on a flight from San Francisco
two days ago.

224
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,305
Two days ago?

225
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:20,087
Maybe he already left,
went somewhere else.

226
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,776
Asia's a very big place, you know.

227
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,501
We were hoping
you'd hold onto this for reference.

228
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:27,189
We're here because Frank is
fighting in the kumite...

229
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:29,397
...and we're here to stop him.

230
00:27:31,993 --> 00:27:33,303
The kumite?

231
00:27:34,425 --> 00:27:35,440
Yes.

232
00:27:49,434 --> 00:27:50,993
Inspector Chen...

233
00:27:51,449 --> 00:27:54,743
...we all know the kumite
is happening here in Hong Kong.

234
00:27:54,808 --> 00:27:58,124
And we all know it's going on
over the next three days.

235
00:27:59,321 --> 00:28:02,189
All we want you to do is
pass this picture out to your men.

236
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:05,111
If they spot Dux,
they give us a call at our hotel. Simple.

237
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:07,117
My men already overworked.

238
00:28:07,864 --> 00:28:10,995
- If it's too much trouble, forget it...
- Inspector...

239
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,163
We're all overworked,
but we need your help.

240
00:28:15,831 --> 00:28:17,773
I'll see what can be done.

241
00:28:18,296 --> 00:28:20,303
You know where to reach us.

242
00:28:22,807 --> 00:28:25,425
You'll come upstairs with me
for an interview.

243
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:26,933
Like hell! Let go of me.

244
00:28:26,998 --> 00:28:28,526
You want Hussein, no?

245
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:30,158
No. Hussein is an asshole.

246
00:28:30,231 --> 00:28:31,953
What did you call me?

247
00:28:32,022 --> 00:28:34,444
You want me to spell it out for you?

248
00:28:39,414 --> 00:28:40,910
Leave the girl alone.

249
00:28:40,983 --> 00:28:43,949
He is the American shithead
who makes tricks with bricks.

250
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:46,574
Guess the kumite starts
one day earlier this year, huh?

251
00:28:46,645 --> 00:28:49,066
- Look, guys, let's all calm down, okay?
- No.

252
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:51,030
She is coming with me upstairs.

253
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:52,042
No, I'm not.

254
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:53,710
If we have to fight for her...

255
00:28:53,781 --> 00:28:56,945
...then both of us will
be thrown out of the kumite.

256
00:28:57,974 --> 00:28:59,380
Just for her?

257
00:29:00,854 --> 00:29:03,188
We could arrange this another way.

258
00:29:04,149 --> 00:29:06,188
- Do you gamble?
- What is bet?

259
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:08,553
You hold this.

260
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,472
If I can grab it before you close your hand...

261
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,135
...l get the girl.

262
00:29:13,588 --> 00:29:15,017
If I cannot...

263
00:29:16,084 --> 00:29:17,546
...she's yours.

264
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,243
Very good.

265
00:29:19,317 --> 00:29:21,225
What? You can't do this!

266
00:29:21,589 --> 00:29:22,898
Just relax.

267
00:29:27,219 --> 00:29:28,397
Take it.

268
00:29:32,212 --> 00:29:35,246
Geez, Frankie,
l hope you know what you're doing.

269
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:37,931
Ready?

270
00:29:42,484 --> 00:29:43,465
Go.

271
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:47,307
You lose, American asshole.

272
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:00,271
Looks like she's mine.

273
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:03,624
Now leave the lady alone.
You understand that?

274
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:09,160
Why were you with Hussein?

275
00:30:11,121 --> 00:30:13,805
I've been trying
to get a story on the kumite.

276
00:30:13,874 --> 00:30:15,336
I'm a reporter.

277
00:30:18,193 --> 00:30:19,916
He tell you anything?

278
00:30:21,041 --> 00:30:23,049
He told me I had nice legs.

279
00:30:23,857 --> 00:30:25,548
He's right about that.

280
00:30:25,618 --> 00:30:28,651
Why is it that no one
will talk about the kumite?

281
00:30:28,882 --> 00:30:30,703
What is this air of mystery?

282
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,519
I'm just trying to find out
what it's all about.

283
00:30:33,585 --> 00:30:35,592
Why are you fighting in it?

284
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:37,582
It's personal.

285
00:30:37,648 --> 00:30:40,037
You want to prove
your manhood to the world?

286
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:43,855
The kumite is for the fighters,
not for the people who read newspapers.

287
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,276
I've heard that it's unnecessarily brutal...

288
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,279
...like a cockfight, except it's with people.

289
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,647
You have the wrong picture.

290
00:30:53,104 --> 00:30:54,959
Well, you tell me about it then.

291
00:30:55,024 --> 00:30:57,326
I want to have the right picture.

292
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,396
Okay, I'll talk to you, but one condition.

293
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,541
What's that?

294
00:31:02,831 --> 00:31:05,799
You agree to have dinner with me
tomorrow night.

295
00:31:06,350 --> 00:31:09,482
Well, actually, I was hoping
Hussein would be free.

296
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,789
That hurts me, just looking at it.

297
00:31:33,038 --> 00:31:34,379
Yo, Frankie!

298
00:31:34,606 --> 00:31:35,947
Earth to Frankie.

299
00:31:36,013 --> 00:31:38,501
This is ground control. Do you copy?

300
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:43,916
It's time to get ready.

301
00:31:47,598 --> 00:31:49,124
You'd better stop doing that stuff.

302
00:31:49,197 --> 00:31:52,066
You might want to have kids
one of these days.

303
00:31:56,461 --> 00:32:00,007
Victor's downstairs.
Kumite Express leaves in five minutes.

304
00:32:06,988 --> 00:32:08,417
Are you ready?

305
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:16,297
I am ready.

306
00:32:27,276 --> 00:32:30,177
You can almost smell the adrenaline
in this place, can't you?

307
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,298
Yeah.

308
00:32:33,227 --> 00:32:35,529
They are gonna love me over here.

309
00:32:35,915 --> 00:32:39,047
You can really love Asians
because we're good-looking.

310
00:32:55,402 --> 00:32:57,606
Welcome, warriors of the world.

311
00:32:57,898 --> 00:33:00,931
Today you become part of a tradition...

312
00:33:01,322 --> 00:33:03,744
...that began hundreds of years ago.

313
00:33:04,617 --> 00:33:07,967
The kumite was first used
by the Kokuryukai...

314
00:33:08,297 --> 00:33:10,436
...the Black Dragon Society...

315
00:33:10,729 --> 00:33:13,991
...to measure the fighting skills and spirit...

316
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:15,811
...of its members.

317
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:19,750
Every five years,
the best fighters in its ranks...

318
00:33:20,841 --> 00:33:23,623
...would face each other in full-contact...

319
00:33:24,904 --> 00:33:29,792
...with one winner emerging
as the superior warrior...

320
00:33:29,864 --> 00:33:31,205
...the champion.

321
00:33:31,655 --> 00:33:33,566
The Kokuryukai has been joined...

322
00:33:33,639 --> 00:33:36,804
...by the International
Fighting Arts Association...

323
00:33:36,936 --> 00:33:39,522
...as co-sponsor for this event...

324
00:33:40,232 --> 00:33:44,487
...and as the guardians
of a rich and powerful heritage.

325
00:33:46,663 --> 00:33:47,973
After three days...

326
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,749
...one fighter will prove himself
to be the best.

327
00:33:52,167 --> 00:33:54,556
May the mightiest warrior prevail!

328
00:34:29,029 --> 00:34:31,331
Now, remember, it's full-contact.

329
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:34,972
There are three ways to win.
One, you knock the guy out.

330
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:37,854
Two, your opponent quits
and shouts, "matte."

331
00:34:38,181 --> 00:34:40,035
It's like saying uncle.

332
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,522
Three, you throw the fucker
right off the runway.

333
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,795
Piece of cake.

334
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:46,716
Haji!

335
00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:52,669
Hajime!

336
00:35:15,012 --> 00:35:17,378
That's why they call
this thing "bloodsport," kid.

337
00:35:51,456 --> 00:35:54,490
Watch this, Frankie.
I'll show you how it's done, buddy.

338
00:36:16,832 --> 00:36:17,781
Haji!

339
00:36:17,857 --> 00:36:19,034
Asshole.

340
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,538
Hajime!

341
00:36:40,447 --> 00:36:42,390
Come on, get up! Come on!

342
00:36:43,615 --> 00:36:45,621
I'm going to kill you, man!

343
00:36:48,511 --> 00:36:49,820
You got it!

344
00:36:55,934 --> 00:36:57,341
Frankie!

345
00:36:58,462 --> 00:37:00,403
Look at him, buddy. Yeah!

346
00:37:08,318 --> 00:37:09,365
You check that out?

347
00:37:09,438 --> 00:37:11,543
- Good stuff, Jackson.
- Thanks.

348
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:15,987
But what took you so long?

349
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:17,720
Funny. Real funny.

350
00:37:21,084 --> 00:37:23,955
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

351
00:37:24,029 --> 00:37:25,622
What's going on?

352
00:37:25,692 --> 00:37:27,219
That's Chong Li, the current champ.

353
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:28,721
He's never been defeated.

354
00:37:28,797 --> 00:37:31,764
Holds all the records,
including the fastest KO.

355
00:37:32,508 --> 00:37:34,395
He killed a guy during the last kumite.

356
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,494
Yeah, kicked the poor bastard
right in the throat.

357
00:37:37,628 --> 00:37:39,832
Guy died right there on the platform.

358
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:42,775
Chong Li stood there and watched him die.

359
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:58,644
Junbi!

360
00:37:59,867 --> 00:38:00,915
Haji!

361
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,037
Hajime!

362
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:26,774
Chong Li! Chong Li! Chong Li!

363
00:39:00,857 --> 00:39:03,157
Now I show you some trick or two.

364
00:39:05,207 --> 00:39:06,320
Junbi!

365
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:13,807
Haji!

366
00:39:16,087 --> 00:39:17,265
Hajime!

367
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:30,961
Fastest I ever saw!

368
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:59,370
His first fight in the kumite,
he broke the fucking world record!

369
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:00,558
My buddy!

370
00:40:17,557 --> 00:40:18,670
Junbi!

371
00:40:24,373 --> 00:40:25,419
Haji!

372
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:29,613
Hajime!

373
00:41:57,167 --> 00:41:58,345
Go home!

374
00:42:32,078 --> 00:42:33,671
This is real good stuff.

375
00:42:33,742 --> 00:42:35,236
How's your eel, as good as mine?

376
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:37,252
I don't know, I haven't tasted it yet.

377
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:39,562
You gotta tell them to kill it first.

378
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:42,088
You should ask for forks.

379
00:42:42,157 --> 00:42:43,619
Inspector Chen.

380
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:45,894
What a pleasant surprise. Please join us.

381
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,459
No. I never eat here.

382
00:42:47,533 --> 00:42:49,540
I found some information for you.

383
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:51,205
What is it, Inspector?

384
00:42:51,276 --> 00:42:53,829
Frank Dux is at the East Lake Hotel
in Kowloon.

385
00:42:54,669 --> 00:42:55,945
Thank you.

386
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:58,850
Hey, have some eel.

387
00:43:11,083 --> 00:43:13,472
Okay, Dux, you know why we're here.

388
00:43:14,316 --> 00:43:16,803
We're taking you back, Frank. Let's go.

389
00:43:16,875 --> 00:43:18,630
Only when the kumite is over.

390
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,837
Who the hell are these two scumbags?

391
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:23,558
Just stay out of it, pal.
It's not your business, okay?

392
00:43:23,628 --> 00:43:25,732
I ain't your pal, dickface.

393
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:29,857
Look, Frank...

394
00:43:30,059 --> 00:43:33,058
...the government has invested
a lot of time and money in you.

395
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:35,041
Uncle Sam can't afford to let you get hurt.

396
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:36,456
I won't get hurt.

397
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:39,304
That's why we're here,
to make sure of that.

398
00:43:39,947 --> 00:43:41,921
Don't make it tough on us.

399
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:53,128
I'll be in the airport in two days.

400
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:55,711
That's not good enough.

401
00:43:55,786 --> 00:43:59,680
Frank, read my lips.
We are taking you back now.

402
00:44:01,738 --> 00:44:04,421
Don't make us use 50,000 volts on you.

403
00:44:08,552 --> 00:44:09,502
Excuse me.

404
00:44:10,217 --> 00:44:11,876
You want to shit sparks?

405
00:44:11,945 --> 00:44:13,700
You just stay put, okay?

406
00:44:14,058 --> 00:44:15,486
Stay put.

407
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:12,288
All those different fighters in one event.

408
00:46:12,355 --> 00:46:15,201
- It sounds wild.
- You'd have to see it to believe it.

409
00:46:15,266 --> 00:46:17,055
Come on, Frank.

410
00:46:17,378 --> 00:46:18,906
Couldn't you just get me in?

411
00:46:18,978 --> 00:46:22,012
I really want this story.
It would mean so much to me.

412
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:25,181
They have strict rules. No press.

413
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,201
I bet we could think of something.

414
00:46:27,586 --> 00:46:29,213
I doubt it.

415
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:31,419
You telling me you never break rules?

416
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:32,601
What do you mean?

417
00:46:32,866 --> 00:46:34,654
Who are Helmer and Rawlins?

418
00:46:35,681 --> 00:46:37,983
Just friends. Why?

419
00:46:38,465 --> 00:46:40,538
They must be very close friends.

420
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:43,967
They've been inquiring about you
all over Hong Kong.

421
00:46:45,218 --> 00:46:46,712
What do you want from me?

422
00:46:47,041 --> 00:46:49,496
I'd really like you to help me
get into the kumite.

423
00:46:51,937 --> 00:46:53,629
But more than that...

424
00:46:54,656 --> 00:46:57,144
...I'd really like to get to know you.

425
00:46:59,713 --> 00:47:01,949
After all, we have all night.

426
00:47:49,087 --> 00:47:50,461
I have to go.

427
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,660
I know.

428
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:56,563
Good luck today.

429
00:47:56,894 --> 00:47:58,071
Thanks.

430
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,912
Meet me for dinner again tonight?

431
00:48:02,077 --> 00:48:03,025
Sure.

432
00:48:04,734 --> 00:48:07,385
About the kumite, I'm sorry.

433
00:48:07,486 --> 00:48:09,143
I cannot help you.

434
00:48:10,109 --> 00:48:11,418
It's okay.

435
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:13,656
I'll get over it.

436
00:48:30,653 --> 00:48:32,082
See you.

437
00:49:00,699 --> 00:49:02,553
Where the hell have you been?

438
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:05,816
You can't just disappear
in the middle of kumite like that!

439
00:49:05,914 --> 00:49:08,019
I got a rep to uphold, you know.

440
00:49:08,251 --> 00:49:10,771
You and Jackson don't tell me nothing.

441
00:49:10,874 --> 00:49:12,762
You guys are driving me crazy!

442
00:49:12,858 --> 00:49:14,482
Right now, hurry up and change.

443
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:16,882
Pick a brick, any brick.

444
00:49:17,466 --> 00:49:19,407
I know. The bottom one, right?

445
00:49:30,234 --> 00:49:32,176
See? Not a scratch on it.

446
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:37,973
Neither is this.

447
00:49:39,064 --> 00:49:40,691
For you.

448
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:44,854
Yo, Frankie.

449
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:46,837
I hope we don't bump heads.

450
00:49:47,001 --> 00:49:48,375
Come on, let's do it, buddy.

451
00:49:48,664 --> 00:49:49,941
Feel strong today?

452
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:51,505
I feel fine.

453
00:49:51,672 --> 00:49:53,526
Good. You're a good fighter.

454
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:55,982
- Good.
- Thanks.

455
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:08,852
This isn't the first time
I've had to go undercover to get a story.

456
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:35,184
Chong Li! Chong Li!

457
00:54:02,412 --> 00:54:03,754
Junbi!

458
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,257
Haji!

459
00:54:26,314 --> 00:54:27,623
Hajime!

460
00:57:26,722 --> 00:57:28,632
All right, Frankie! Yeah!

461
00:57:33,570 --> 00:57:35,675
Dux! Dux!

462
00:57:42,977 --> 00:57:45,017
Time to separate the men from the boys.

463
00:57:45,153 --> 00:57:48,382
Just be careful Chong Li doesn't separate
your head from your body.

464
00:57:49,633 --> 00:57:51,641
Go for the gut. He's soft there.

465
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:53,338
What are you talking about?

466
00:57:53,408 --> 00:57:55,262
Chong Li's weak in the gut.

467
00:57:55,361 --> 00:57:57,400
That's how Parades surprised him.

468
00:57:57,504 --> 00:57:58,780
You listening to me?

469
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,295
Go for the stomach
and stay away from his right leg.

470
00:58:02,689 --> 00:58:05,536
Will you stop worrying, Frankie?
I've got it under control.

471
00:58:06,433 --> 00:58:08,888
You sound like my mother. Man alive.

472
00:58:13,953 --> 00:58:15,381
Junbi!

473
00:58:17,759 --> 00:58:19,351
Haji!

474
00:58:20,703 --> 00:58:22,077
Hajime!

475
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:32,155
I got him!

476
00:58:32,287 --> 00:58:34,555
What are you doing? Keep going!

477
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,470
Jackson! Jackson!

478
00:58:43,582 --> 00:58:44,792
I put him down!

479
00:58:44,926 --> 00:58:46,999
He's dead! I got him! Yeah!

480
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:07,507
No! Stop!

481
00:59:21,405 --> 00:59:23,259
Chong Li! Chong Li!

482
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,416
Come back, Frank!

483
01:00:14,873 --> 01:00:16,247
Ray, I'm here.

484
01:00:19,354 --> 01:00:21,940
The doctor says you're going to be okay.

485
01:00:23,034 --> 01:00:25,368
You are lucky you have a head like a rock.

486
01:00:25,433 --> 01:00:27,537
Yeah, you'll be out of here in a week.

487
01:00:31,096 --> 01:00:33,104
I'll get back at Chong Li.

488
01:00:33,881 --> 01:00:35,288
That's a promise.

489
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:38,263
You think that's what he wants,
someone to share a room with?

490
01:00:38,905 --> 01:00:40,792
Janice, stay out of this.

491
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,309
Frank, I don't want to see you get hurt.

492
01:00:43,737 --> 01:00:44,881
Then don't watch.

493
01:00:44,952 --> 01:00:46,926
If you want to argue, go elsewhere, please.

494
01:00:48,824 --> 01:00:49,772
Sorry.

495
01:00:52,984 --> 01:00:56,148
You're not even trying to understand
what this means to us, are you?

496
01:00:56,216 --> 01:00:58,550
What's to understand about
a bunch of guys...

497
01:00:58,617 --> 01:01:01,517
...who have to prove themselves
by beating each other up?

498
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,439
- Why are you a reporter?
- What does that have to do with it?

499
01:01:04,503 --> 01:01:06,162
Just answer the question.

500
01:01:06,231 --> 01:01:07,638
My father was a reporter.

501
01:01:07,703 --> 01:01:10,223
I was a good writer.
It seemed the right thing to do.

502
01:01:10,711 --> 01:01:15,020
And you want to be the best reporter
you can be, for him and yourself, right?

503
01:01:15,095 --> 01:01:16,305
Yes, that's right.

504
01:01:16,374 --> 01:01:19,025
I'm just trying to be the best I can be.

505
01:01:19,415 --> 01:01:22,578
Not just for me,
for Tanaka, my Shidoshi, too.

506
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,946
Great, Frank, that's just great!

507
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,191
Go right ahead!

508
01:01:26,261 --> 01:01:29,077
I just hope you don't end up like Jackson,
or worse!

509
01:01:29,206 --> 01:01:31,376
But I'm not going to stand around
and watch it.

510
01:01:35,510 --> 01:01:37,364
You're blowing it, Frank.

511
01:01:37,782 --> 01:01:39,636
Forget about the girl.

512
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,095
Forget about getting back
at Chong Li for Ray.

513
01:01:42,197 --> 01:01:45,013
You have a chance to take it all tomorrow.
Do you understand?

514
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:48,240
You can be the first Westerner
to win this thing.

515
01:01:48,308 --> 01:01:51,157
But you got to have a clear head.
You hear me?

516
01:02:02,486 --> 01:02:04,852
Why are you so interested
in stopping the kumite?

517
01:02:05,077 --> 01:02:07,444
Someone almost got killed there today.

518
01:02:08,693 --> 01:02:11,659
I have a friend fighting in it.
I don't want him to get hurt.

519
01:02:22,004 --> 01:02:23,312
Who is your friend?

520
01:02:23,411 --> 01:02:24,905
His name is...

521
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:27,501
...Frank Dux.

522
01:04:56,268 --> 01:04:57,861
You guys here for the finals?

523
01:04:57,932 --> 01:05:01,827
There aren't going to be any finals, Dux,
at least not for you.

524
01:05:02,379 --> 01:05:03,875
Don't try to stop me.

525
01:05:04,269 --> 01:05:06,570
We're not. He will.

526
01:05:10,220 --> 01:05:12,554
I didn't come this far to stop now.

527
01:05:12,715 --> 01:05:15,017
You shouldn't have come in the first place.

528
01:05:15,115 --> 01:05:16,523
Take him.

529
01:05:44,938 --> 01:05:47,077
You're really being a hard-ass about this.

530
01:05:47,146 --> 01:05:48,194
Careful.

531
01:05:48,394 --> 01:05:51,841
- Put these on and I won't have to use it.
- It's your last warning.

532
01:05:57,769 --> 01:06:00,585
Inspector, no. We've got to take him back.

533
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:04,898
Just give us a break.
We've chased you all over Hong Kong.

534
01:06:04,968 --> 01:06:07,554
- Can we stop this?
- Okay, Frank, you win.

535
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:10,211
But it's wrong what you're doing.
It's a mistake.

536
01:06:12,488 --> 01:06:15,139
I'll meet you at the airport tomorrow.

537
01:06:20,168 --> 01:06:21,542
Now what?

538
01:06:22,024 --> 01:06:23,934
How are we going to stop him?

539
01:06:25,288 --> 01:06:26,717
Follow me.

540
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:33,953
Time's up. We can't wait any longer.

541
01:06:34,183 --> 01:06:37,217
Give me one more minute.
I give you my word. He'll be here.

542
01:06:37,287 --> 01:06:39,523
We must follow the rules.

543
01:06:39,784 --> 01:06:41,157
Where's Mr. Dux?

544
01:06:41,223 --> 01:06:44,452
I wish everyone would calm down.
I said, he'll be here.

545
01:06:44,519 --> 01:06:45,947
- Too late.
- Too late?

546
01:06:47,463 --> 01:06:49,700
No such thing as too late.

547
01:06:51,814 --> 01:06:53,024
Finally.

548
01:06:56,102 --> 01:06:58,241
- It's about fucking time!
- Sorry.

549
01:06:58,374 --> 01:06:59,999
How do you feel today, Dux?

550
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,150
I feel good.

551
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:02,556
I am ready.

552
01:07:02,789 --> 01:07:04,099
Dux, my man!

553
01:07:46,595 --> 01:07:47,708
Junbi!

554
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,387
Haji!

555
01:07:53,540 --> 01:07:54,816
Hajime!

556
01:08:48,993 --> 01:08:50,073
Come on!

557
01:09:22,495 --> 01:09:23,772
Well done.

558
01:09:49,374 --> 01:09:50,618
Junbi!

559
01:09:51,358 --> 01:09:52,503
Haji!

560
01:09:54,142 --> 01:09:55,286
Hajime!

561
01:11:51,288 --> 01:11:53,044
You are next.

562
01:12:22,069 --> 01:12:25,005
Prepare the platform for the final match.

563
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,761
This is it, Frank.

564
01:12:28,342 --> 01:12:30,033
You can make history here today.

565
01:12:45,013 --> 01:12:46,289
You okay?

566
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:49,612
Yeah.

567
01:13:51,954 --> 01:13:53,328
Junbi!

568
01:13:58,610 --> 01:13:59,559
Haji!

569
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:21,581
You break my record, now I break you.

570
01:14:21,903 --> 01:14:23,814
Like I break your friend.

571
01:14:36,336 --> 01:14:37,710
Hajime!

572
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:08,745
Get him! Come on!

573
01:15:20,973 --> 01:15:21,988
Get up!

574
01:15:57,004 --> 01:15:58,017
Right on!

575
01:15:58,123 --> 01:15:59,367
Come on!

576
01:16:35,562 --> 01:16:36,511
More!

577
01:17:29,607 --> 01:17:30,622
Up!

578
01:18:22,660 --> 01:18:23,969
Get up, Frankie!

579
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:08,373
All right!

580
01:21:13,117 --> 01:21:14,197
Say it!

581
01:21:21,020 --> 01:21:22,645
Matte!

582
01:21:25,147 --> 01:21:26,260
All right!

583
01:21:47,930 --> 01:21:51,639
Mr. Dux, you fought with inspiration.

584
01:21:52,122 --> 01:21:54,991
We of the Kokuryukai salute you.

585
01:22:13,848 --> 01:22:15,759
This is for you, Shidoshi.

586
01:22:18,265 --> 01:22:20,469
So you stomped him real good?

587
01:22:21,048 --> 01:22:22,096
Worse.

588
01:22:23,193 --> 01:22:24,753
What do you mean?

589
01:22:25,688 --> 01:22:27,379
He made him say matte.

590
01:22:29,241 --> 01:22:31,150
All right, Frankie!

591
01:22:32,312 --> 01:22:33,905
Don't you get too cocky.

592
01:22:34,008 --> 01:22:36,463
Because you might have to
go up against me next time.

593
01:22:36,536 --> 01:22:38,161
I promise.

594
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:41,135
You guys are out of your minds!

595
01:22:41,848 --> 01:22:43,735
I'll drink to that!

596
01:22:44,375 --> 01:22:46,448
By the way, next time you fight...

597
01:22:47,256 --> 01:22:49,077
...try to keep your clothes on.

598
01:22:54,231 --> 01:22:58,092
Anytime, anyplace, anywhere...

599
01:22:58,391 --> 01:23:01,391
...if you ever need me, I'll be there.

600
01:23:04,664 --> 01:23:06,321
I love you, my friend.

601
01:23:11,062 --> 01:23:12,306
Me, too.

602
01:23:16,951 --> 01:23:17,966
Take care.

603
01:23:31,253 --> 01:23:32,747
He's not going to show.

604
01:23:33,429 --> 01:23:35,534
Looks like he did it to us again, huh?

605
01:23:37,941 --> 01:23:39,087
Hey, guys!

606
01:23:39,573 --> 01:23:41,167
You coming or what?

607
01:23:42,965 --> 01:23:44,787
You son of a bitch.

608
01:23:45,717 --> 01:23:47,025
You're always late!

609
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:54,478
You're really a pain in the ass,
you know that?

610
01:23:57,684 --> 01:23:59,691
I'm just glad you're on our side, kid.
