Whoa.

181
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,960
I don't really feel good
about this, Elijah.

182
00:13:47,094 --> 00:13:49,863
Jedediah killing you
will feel worse.

Stop saying that.

Unto you be peace, Jedediah.

Judging by
your unarranged arrival,

00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:14,114
you most likely lack my money,

It's only been a few hours.

You said I had 30 days
to pay you back.

Mmm-hmm. Now it's 29 days,
22 hours,

I'm, I'm gonna get
a little evil first.

202
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:42,777
Isn't the act of crucifixion
in and of itself evil?

You know, you make
a deal with the devil, hmm,

a shekel. [CHUCKLES]

You want me to baptize you to
attain good favor with our Lord

so that when you are called
to heaven, you and this Bushman

by pretending
you are now righteous,

into a believer in the hope

won't kill you?

You are not a believer.

there's a beautiful soul
in there somewhere.

always selling his illegalities

253

when he could just as easily
have a regular occupation.

254
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:12,292
And now he's in trouble
with the village terror,

255
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:16,463
and he's also in love
with said terror's little sister

who he is not in the slightest
bit worthy of, I might add.

Dear Lord,

00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:25,573
he is definitely going to get
killed by Jedediah the Terrible,

inside heaven, Lord.

what he's missing

the depth of his own idiocy
