1
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,160
哈羅?
Hello?

2
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,210
哈羅?
Hello?

3
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,040
救救我
Hey! Hey! Help me!

4
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
去帶他出來
Go get him.

5
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:11,600
你的第一天,菜鳥
Day one, Greenie.

6
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:12,840
該起床了
Rise and shine.

7
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,040
我覺得他應該幹雜活手
He looks like a slopper to me.

8
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,320
我在廚房需要幫忙
I could use some help in the kitchen.

9
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,970
有人要落跑了
Hey, we got a runner!

10
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,320
好好看清楚吧
Take it all in.

11
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:11,800
(移 動 迷 宮)


12
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,800
交給你了
He's all yours.

13
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,880
菜鳥,你好
Hey there, Green Bean.

14
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
不要再落跑了,好嗎?
You're not gonna run again. Okay?

15
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
很好
Good.

16
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,490
我叫艾爾比
My name is Alby.

17
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,480
你能聊聊自己嗎?你是誰?
Can you tell me anything about yourself? Who you are?

18
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,480
打哪來的?什麼都行
Where you came from? Anything at all.

19
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,560
不行
No.

20
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,370
你能告訴我你的名字嗎?
Can you tell me your name?

21
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,960
我什麼都想不起來
I, uh, I can't remember anything.

22
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,920
- 我為何什麼都不記得?  - 沒關係
- Why can't I remember anything?   - It's okay.

23
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,640
放鬆
Hey, relax.

24
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,000
放鬆
Relax.

25
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,520
這很正常
It's normal.

26
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,330
我們全都經歷過
It happens to us all.

27
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
你一兩天后會想起你的名字的
You'll get your name back in a day or two.

28
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,040
他們只讓我們記得這件事
It's the one thing they let us keep.

29
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,520
這是什麼地方?
What is this place?

30
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,320
我帶你去看看吧
Let me show you.

31
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,760
我們在這裡吃飯
We eat here.

32
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,280
在這裡睡覺
We sleep here.

33
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,800
我們自己種食物跟搭棚子
We grow our own food. We build our own shelter.

34
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,880
不管我們需要什麼,箱子都會提供
Whatever we need, the Box provides.

35
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,600
其餘就靠我們自己了
The rest is up to us.

36
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,400
箱子?
The Box?

37
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,680
對,它一個月會上來一次
Yeah. It's sent up once a month

38
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,120
送物資跟一個新菜鳥來
with fresh supplies and a new Greenie.

39
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
這個月是你
This month that's you.

40
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,370
恭喜了
Congratulations.

41
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,250
送上來?誰把我們帶到這裡的?
Sent up? By who, though? Who put us here?

42
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,560
沒有人知道
That, we don't know.

43
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,080
艾爾比,你沒事吧?
Hey, are you all right, Alby? A-ha!

44
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,080
菜鳥,這是紐特
Green Bean, meet Newt.

45
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,920
我不在的時候就由他負責
When I'm not around, he's in charge.

46
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,760
還好你永遠都在
Well, it's a good thing you're always around then.

47
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
你剛剛跑得可真快
That was some dash you made earlier.

48
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,970
我一度還以為你可以當飛毛腿
For a second, I thought you had the chops to be a runner...

49
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,920
直到你臉栽到地上
...till you face-planted.

50
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,280
好精彩
That was great.

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,440
等等,飛毛腿?
Wait, a "runner"?

52
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,170
紐特,幫我一個忙,去找查克
Newt, do me a favor. Go find Chuck.

53
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,600
- 好  - 謝了
- All right.   - Thanks.

54
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,640
抱歉,參觀時間很趕
Look, I'm sorry to rush this.

55
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:59,960
你上來得有點晚,我們又有很多事要做
You came up a little late, and there's a lot to do.

56
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,480
今晚有特別的計畫
We got something special planned tonight.

57
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
對,你晚點就知道了
Yeah. You'll see.

58
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,600
希望你沒有懼高症
I hope you're not afraid of heights.

59
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
上來吧,快
Let's go. Come on.

60
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,160
全部就這麼大了
This is all we got.

61
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,160
我們為此辛苦打拚
We've worked hard for it.

62
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,600
如果你尊重這個地方
If you respect this place...

63
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,640
你我就能相安無事
you and I will get along just fine.

64
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,530
外面是什麼?
What's out there?

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,650
我們只有三條規矩
We only have three rules.

66
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,320
第一,做好你的分內事
First, do your part.

67
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,000
我們沒空理白吃白喝的人
No time for any freeloaders.

68
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,840
第二,不能傷害幽地鬥士
Second, never harm another Glader.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,080
大家要互相信任才能成功
None of this works unless we have trust.

70
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
最重要的是
Most importantly...

71
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,920
千萬別到那些牆後面
never go beyond those walls.

72
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,680
菜鳥,懂嗎?
Do you understand me, Greenie?

73
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,440
艾爾比
Hey, Alby!

74
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,800
查克,你跑去哪了?
Hey, Chuck. Where you been, man?

75
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,280
大家都一樣
It's basically the same story for all of us.

76
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,520
我們在箱子裡醒來,艾爾比帶我們參觀
We wake up in the Box, Alby gives us the tour...

77
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,040
然後我們就在這裡了
then here we are.

78
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
別擔心
Don't worry.

79
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,000
你已經比我表現好了
You're already doing better than I did.

80
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,240
他們把我從大籠子拖出來時
I clunked my pants three times

81
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,280
我嚇到銼屎三次
before they got me out of the pit.

82
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,520
不會吧
No, come on.

83
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,040
你要去哪?
Dude, where are you going?

84
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,400
我只是想看看
I just wanna see.

85
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,040
你愛怎麼看都行
You can look around all you want

86
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,730
但你最好不要過去
but you better not go out there.

87
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,370
為什麼?那裡有什麼?
Why not? What's through there?

88
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,250
不知道,我只知道他們告訴我的事
I don't know. I just know what I'm told.

89
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,730
我們不能離開
And we're not supposed to leave.

90
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,080
查克,這是新來的菜鳥嗎?
Hey, Chuck. New Greenie, huh?

91
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,090
升格的感覺怎麼樣?
How does it feel to be promoted?

92
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,730
本,感覺很贊
Feels great, Ben.

93
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,240
我以為沒人能離開
I thought no one was allowed to leave.

94
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,200
我是說我們不能離開
I said we're not allowed to leave.

95
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,850
他們是飛毛腿,不一樣
They're different, they're runners.

96
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,720
他們比別人都瞭解迷宮
They know more about the maze than anyone.

97
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,160
等等,什麼?
Wait, what?

98
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,600
什麼?
What?

99
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,600
什麼?你剛剛說迷宮?
What? You just said "maze."

100
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,610
我有嗎?
I did?

101
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,760
對
Yeah.

102
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,120
你要去哪?你在幹嘛?
Where are you going? What are you doing?

103
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,440
我只是想看一下
I'm just gonna take a look.

104
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,090
我跟你說過你不行了
I told you, you can't.

105
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,760
沒人能離開,尤其不是現在
No one leaves, especially not now.

106
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,080
不安全
It's not safe.

107
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,440
好,我不會進去
Okay, all right, I'm not gonna go.

108
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,130
菜鳥,我們不能再這樣碰面了
We gotta stop meeting like this, Greenie.

109
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,520
- 放開我  - 好了,冷靜點
- Get off me!   - All right! Calm, calm, calm.

110
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,880
- 別碰我  - 不要激動
- Don't touch me!   - Whoa! Take it easy!

111
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
放輕鬆
Just relax.

112
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,570
你們有什麼毛病?
What the hell is wrong with you guys?

113
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,760
冷靜下來,好嗎?
Just calm down, all right?

114
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,880
不,好吧,你們為什麼不告訴我外面是什麼
No, okay? Why won't you tell me what's out there?

115
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,480
我們只是想保護你,這是為了你好
We're just trying to protect you. It's for your own good.

116
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,640
你們不能把我關在這裡
You guys can't just keep me here.

117
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,720
- 我不能讓你走  - 為什麼不行?
- I can't let you leave.   - Why not?

118
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,810
什麼東西?
What the hell?

119
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,400
下次,我會讓你走的
Next time, I'm gonna let you leave.

120
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,720
歡迎來到迷宮幽地
Welcome to the Glade.

121
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
點火吧
Light him up!

122
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,880
菜鳥,第一天還真精彩
Hell of a first day, Greenie.

123
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,600
來
Here.

124
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,840
來點烈的吧
Put some hair on your chest.

125
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,840
天啊,這是什麼?
Oh, my God! What is that?

126
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,480
我不知道
I don't even know.

127
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,490
這是蓋裡的配方
It's Gally's recipe.

128
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,680
商業機密
It's a trade secret.

129
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,680
對,他還是混蛋一個
Yeah, well, he's still an asshole.

130
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,320
他今天救了你一命
He saved your life today.

131
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,880
相信我,迷宮是危險的地方
Trust me. The maze is a dangerous place.

132
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,800
我們被困在這裡了吧?
We're trapped here, aren't we?

133
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,680
目前是
For the moment.

134
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,640
不過...
But...

135
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,680
你看到這些人嗎?
you see those guys?

136
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,000
火旁邊的人?
There, by the fire?

137
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,530
他們是飛毛腿
Those are the runners.

138
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,720
中間那個是米諾
That guy in the middle there, that's Minho.

139
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,250
他是飛毛腿的小隊長
He's the Keeper of the Runners.

140
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,160
每天早上這些門開啟後
Every morning, when those doors open, they run the maze...

141
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,280
他們會進迷宮
mapping it, memorizing it,

142
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,640
畫地圖、記下來,試著找路離開
trying to find a way out.

143
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,650
他們找多久了?
How long have they been looking?

144
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,240
三年了
Three years.

145
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,680
他們什麼都沒發現嗎?
And they haven't found anything?

146
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,240
說比做容易多了
It's a lot easier said than done.

147
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,160
仔細聽
Listen.

148
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,480
聽到了嗎?
Hear that?

149
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,760
迷宮一直在變化
It's the maze, changing.

150
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,730
每天晚上都會改變
It changes every night.

151
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,840
怎麼可能?
How is that even possible?

152
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,490
去問把我們放在這裡的人啊
You can ask the people who put us in here,

153
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,680
如果你能見到那些混蛋的話
if you ever meet the bastards.

154
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,880
聽著,事實上
Listen, the truth is...

155
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,050
只有飛毛腿知道外面有什麼
the runners are the only ones who really know what's out there.

156
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,360
他們是我們當中最壯最快的人
They are the strongest and the fastest of us all.

157
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,440
這也是好事
And it's a good thing, too...

158
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,640
如果他們在門關上前沒回來
because if they don't make it back before those doors close...

159
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,720
晚上就會困在那裡
then they are stuck out there for the night.

160
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,250
從沒有人能夠在迷宮內活過一晚
And no one has ever survived a night in the maze.

161
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:21,530
他們會怎樣?
What happens to them?

162
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,440
我們叫它們鬼火獸
Well, we call them Grievers.

163
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,370
當然,沒人看過後還能活著說出來
Of course, no one's ever seen one and lived to tell about it.

164
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,930
但迷宮裡有鬼火獸
But they're out there.

165
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,800
好了,你今晚問夠了
Right, that's enough questions for one night.

166
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,880
走吧
Come on.

167
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,560
你可是貴賓
You're supposed to be the guest of honor.

168
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,920
不,來吧,我帶你去參觀
Oh, no... No! No, come on. Let me show you around.

169
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,840
來吧
Come on.

170
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,690
那是土木手
And there we got the builders.

171
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,480
他們的手很巧
They're very good with their hands...

172
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,560
但腦袋空空
but not a lot going on upstairs.

173
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,650
那是溫斯頓
And then we got Winston...

174
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,000
他是開膛手的小隊長
he's the Keeper of the Slicers.

175
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,520
我們有兩個醫療手,科林特跟傑夫
And we got two med-jacks, Clint and Jeff.

176
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,250
- 怎麼樣?  - 紐特
- Hey, what's up?   - Yo, Newt.

177
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,410
他們大部分時間都在替開膛手包紮
They spend most of their time bandaging up the slicers.

178
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,480
如果我想當飛毛腿呢?
What if I want to be a runner?

179
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:19,840
我剛剛說的話你有聽進去嗎?
Have you listened to a word I've just said?

180
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,560
沒人想當飛毛腿
No one wants to be a runner.

181
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,840
況且,你得被選上才行
And, besides, you gotta get chosen.

182
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,040
被誰選上?
Chosen by who?

183
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,680
菜鳥,怎麼樣?
What do you say, Greenie?

184
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,490
想讓大家看看你的本事嗎?
Wanna see what you're made of?

185
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,570
菜鳥!菜鳥!菜鳥!
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

186
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,290
好
Okay. All right.

187
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,040
菜鳥,規則很簡單
The rules are simple, Greenie.

188
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,720
我想辦法把你推出圈外
I try to push you out of the circle...

189
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,720
你想辦法撐過5秒就行了
you try to last more than five seconds.

190
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,680
別對菜鳥下手太重
Take it easy on the Greenie.

191
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,680
準備好了嗎?
Ready?

192
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
起來吧
Get up, boy.

193
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,960
菜鳥,來吧,我跟你還沒完
Come on, Greenie. We're not done yet.

194
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,720
別再叫我菜鳥了
Stop calling me Greenie.

195
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,240
別再叫你菜鳥?
Stop calling you that?

196
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,920
你想要叫啥?遜客?
What do you wanna be called? Shank?

197
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,920
你們覺得咧?他看來像遜客嗎?
What do you think, boys? Does he look like a Shank?

198
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,000
好慘
Come on!

199
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,840
你知道嗎?我決定叫你遜客了
You know what? I think I've settled on Shank.

200
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,370
菜鳥,幹得好
There you go, Greenie!

201
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
以菜鳥來說還不賴吧?
Not bad for a Greenie, huh?

202
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
湯瑪斯
Thomas.

203
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,210
湯瑪斯
Thomas. Hey!

204
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,040
湯瑪斯
Thomas!

205
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,440
我想起我的名字了,我叫湯瑪斯
I remember my name. I'm Thomas!

206
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,480
湯瑪斯
Thomas!

207
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,640
湯瑪斯,歡迎你回家
Welcome home, Thomas.

208
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,050
好樣的,湯瑪斯
Good job... Thomas.

209
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,040
那是什麼?
What the hell was that?

210
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,880
朋友,那是鬼火獸
That, my friend, was a Griever.

211
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,210
別擔心,你跟我們在一起很安全
Don't worry, you're safe here with us.

212
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,040
什麼都過不了那些牆
Nothing gets through those walls.

213
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
好了,各位
All right, guys.

214
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:08,160
睡覺去吧,走
Let's tuck it in for the night. Come on.

215
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,650
今天晚上很棒
It was a good night.

216
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,240
幹得好
Good job, man.

217
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,840
你跟我們在一起很安全
You're safe here with us.

218
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,240
WICKED很好
Wicked is good.

219
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,360
外面是什麼?
What's out there?

220
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,120
湯瑪斯...
Thomas, Thomas.

221
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,560
你聽得到我說話嗎?
Can you hear me?

222
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,200
一切即將改變
Everything is going to change.

223
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,840
湯瑪斯
Thomas.

224
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,680
跟我來
Shh.

225
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,000
這裡很平靜吧?
Follow me.

226
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,600
我知道這很難讓人相信
It's peaceful, isn't it?

227
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,800
但以前可不是這樣
I know it's hard to believe, but it wasn't always this way.

228
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,920
我們有過黑暗的日子
We had dark days.

229
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,760
我們因為恐懼失去很多男孩
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

230
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,570
還有恐慌
To panic.

231
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,920
我們進步了很多
We've come far since then.

232
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,000
建立秩序
Established order...

233
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,280
締造和平
made peace.

234
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,480
你跟我說這些幹嘛?
Yeah. Why are you telling me this?

235
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,760
你與眾不同
Because you're not like the others.

236
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,200
充滿好奇心
You're curious.

237
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,680
但你是我們的一員了
But you're one of us now.

238
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,800
你得知道這是什麼意義
You need to know what that means.

239
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,040
他們怎麼了?
What happened to them?

240
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,320
就像我說的
Like I said...

241
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,570
黑暗的日子,湯瑪斯
dark days, Thomas.

242
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,760
有人試過爬上去嗎?
Has anyone tried climbing to the top?

243
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,200
試過了,藤蔓沒有到最上面
Tried it. The ivy doesn't go all the way to the top.

244
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,560
況且,上去後要去哪?
And besides, where are you gonna go from there?

245
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:46,720
那箱子呢?下次升上來時...
And what about the Box? You know, next time it comes up...

246
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,720
沒用,我們試過了
No, we tried that.

247
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,680
有人在裡面箱子就不會下去
The Box won't go back down with someone in it.

248
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,120
- 那如果...  - 我們試過了,好嗎?
- Okay, what if we...   - No, we tried it, all right?

249
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:55,760
試了兩次
Twice.

250
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,880
好嗎?相信我
All right? Trust me.

251
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,730
你想得到的我們都試過了
Anything you think of, we've already tried.

252
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,360
只有穿過迷宮才能出去
The only way out of here is through the maze.

253
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,360
聽著,你想幫忙嗎?
Now, look, you wanna be helpful?

254
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,920
去多挖點肥料給我們
Go dig us up some more fertilizer.

255
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,080
"湯瑪斯,拿肥料就對了"
"Just get the fertilizer, Thomas."

256
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,250
"你們確定我幫不上別的忙嗎?"
"Are you sure, guys? I can't help in any other way?"

257
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,520
"不用,拿肥料就好了"
"No, just get the fertilizer.

258
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,370
"你知道在哪,就在樹林中央"
"You know where it is. It's just out in the middle of the woods."

259
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
你是本,對嗎?
You're Ben, right?

260
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,360
我們見過面嗎...
I don't know if we ever...

261
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
你沒事吧?
Are you okay?

262
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,450
放開我
Get the hell off me!

263
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,480
都是你的錯
It's your fault.

264
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,040
我看到你了
I saw you.

265
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,560
這是你害的
You did this.

266
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
我看到你了!
I saw you!

267
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,960
救命啊
Help!

268
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,560
救命,救命啊
Help! Help!

269
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,080
救命啊!
Help!

270
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
我要殺了你!
I'll kill you!

271
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,330
把他壓住
Hold him down.

272
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,240
你在幹嘛?
What are you doing?

273
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,400
本,冷靜點
Calm down, Ben.

274
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,760
發生什麼事了?
What the hell happened?

275
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,040
- 他剛剛攻擊我  - 你沒事吧?
- He just attacked me!   - Are you okay?

276
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
本,冷靜
Calm down, Ben.

277
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,240
不...
No. No.

278
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,520
拉開他的衣服
All right, lift his shirt.

279
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,640
拉開他的衣服!
Lift his shirt.

280
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,000
不!不!不要...
No! No! Please. Please.

281
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,490
他被螫了
He's been stung.

282
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,840
在大白天被螫?
In the middle of the day?

283
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,010
拜託救救我
Help me, please.

284
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,400
拜託
Please.

285
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,970
拜託,救救我
Please, just help.

286
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,560
把他關進大籠子
Put him in the pit.

287
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,130
大家來幫忙,帶他進大籠子
Everybody, help. Take him to the pit.

288
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,890
- 不!  - 醫療手
- No!   - Med-jack!

289
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,370
拜託別這麼做
Please don't do it!

290
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,200
本,冷靜
Calm down, Ben.

291
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,520
本,好了
Back down, Ben.

292
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,760
聽我說,拜託!
Listen to me! Please!

293
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,840
拜託住手
Please, stop, please!

294
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,560
這是他害的
He did this!

295
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,480
拜託住手,不,拜託救救我
Please stop! No! No, please! Help me!

296
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,160
他到底怎麼了?
So what happened to him?

297
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,920
這叫轉化
It's called "The Changing."

298
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,040
人被螫就會這樣
It's what happens when someone gets stung.

299
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,000
聽好
Listen.

300
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,120
本被螫以後話就說不清楚了
We haven't been able to get a clear word out of Ben since it happened.

301
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,120
他說的話完全沒道理
He's not making any sense.

302
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,400
情況只會愈來愈糟
And it's only gonna get worse.

303
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,520
感染擴散了,他很危險
The infection is spreading. He's dangerous.

304
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,120
他跟你說了什麼?
What did he say to you?

305
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:13,250
他說他看到我了...
He said he saw me...

306
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,480
這都是我的錯
and that this was all my fault.

307
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,040
這怎麼會是我的錯?
How could this be my fault?

308
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,770
休息一下吧
Get some rest.

309
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,650
- 艾爾比  - 什麼事?
- Alby?   - Yeah.

310
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,560
他會怎麼樣?
What's gonna happen to him?

311
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,080
聽我說,拜託你聽我說
Just listen to me. Just, please, listen to me!

312
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
米諾,拜託
Please, Minho!

313
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:56,960
艾爾比
Alby!

314
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,120
拜託不要
No, please. Please, don't.

315
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,480
拜託別這麼做
Please, don't do it.

316
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,360
竿子
Poles!

317
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:55,960
往前
Move in!

318
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,000
拜託不要
No, no, no! Please!

319
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,640
拜託不要,拜託,不要
No, please! Please, don't!

320
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,690
我會變好,拜託聽我說
I can get better! Please, just listen to me!

321
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,650
拜託,住手,拜託
Please, stop, please!

322
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,920
- 把他推進去  - 住手
- Push him in!   - Stop!

323
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,920
我會變好
I'll get better!

324
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,440
他現在屬於迷宮了
He belongs to the maze now.

325
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
你覺得他熬得過嗎?
Do you think he might make it?

326
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,050
本?
Ben?

327
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:39,360
不會
No.

328
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,410
沒人在迷宮熬得過一晚
No one survives a night in the maze.

329
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,480
我們只能把他忘了
We just gotta forget about him.

330
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,770
湯瑪斯
Thomas.

331
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,800
WICKED很好
Wicked is good.

332
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,770
別讓他們太輕鬆了
Don't make it easy on them.

333
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,960
湯瑪斯
Thomas.

334
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,800
一切即將改變
Everything is going to change.

335
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,170
WICKED很好
Wicked is good.

336
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,640
這會有點痛
This is gonna hurt a little.

337
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,000
WICKED很好
Wicked is good.

338
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,850
湯瑪斯,你必須抉擇
Thomas, you have to choose.

339
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,400
艾爾比為什麼要進迷宮?
But why would Alby go into the maze?

340
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,880
他又不是飛毛腿
I mean, he's not a runner.

341
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,530
情況不一樣了
Things are different now.

342
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,000
艾爾比在日落前要回溯本的路線
Alby went to retrace Ben's footsteps before sundown.

343
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,160
你要幫忙嗎?
Are you gonna help?

344
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,320
所以他要去本被螫的地方...
So he's gonna go back to where Ben was just stung...

345
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,680
艾爾比清楚自己在做什麼
Alby knows what he's doing...

346
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,200
好嗎?
all right?

347
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,850
他比我們都要清楚
He knows better than any of us.

348
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,360
這是什麼意思?
What does that mean?

349
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,320
事情就像你聽到的
Well, it's like you have heard, yeah?

350
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,450
每個月,箱子會送一個新人上來
Every month, the Box sends up a new arrival.

351
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,200
但總有人是第一個,對嗎?
But someone had to be first, right?

352
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,440
總有人得在迷宮幽地獨自待一個月
Someone had to have spent a whole month in the Glade, alone.

353
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,960
那個人就是艾爾比
That was Alby.

354
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,640
那一定很辛苦
I mean, it can't have been easy.

355
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,640
但其他男孩開始一個接一個出現後
But when those other boys started coming up, one after the other...

356
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,800
他看清楚事實了
he saw the truth.

357
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,160
他發現最重要的事
And he learned that the most important thing...

358
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,200
就是我們擁有彼此
is that we all have each other.

359
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,320
因為我們全都一起捲進這件事了
Because we're all in this together.

360
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,920
對
Yeah.

361
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,680
菜鳥,好樣的
There you go, Greenie.

362
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,680
他們現在應該要回來了
They should be back by now.

363
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,280
萬一他們沒回來呢?
What happens if they don't make it?

364
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,610
他們會回來的
They're gonna make it.

365
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,760
萬一他們沒回來會怎樣?
What happens if they don't?

366
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,450
他們會回來的
They're gonna make it.

367
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,560
拜託,我們不能派人去找他們嗎?
Come on, guys, can't we send someone after them?

368
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,130
這樣違反規定
That's against the rules.

369
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,160
他們要嘛回來,要嘛回不來
Either they make it back or they don't.

370
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,160
我們不能冒險再失去人了
We can't risk losing anyone else.

371
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
那裡!
There!

372
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,000
等等,事情不對勁
Wait, something's wrong.

373
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,040
米諾,快點,你可以的
Come on, Minho, you can do it!

374
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,280
快啊
Come on! Go!

375
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,200
快點,你趕得及的
Come on, you can make it!

376
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,880
米諾,你得丟下他
Minho, you gotta leave him!

377
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,610
他們來不及了
They're not gonna make it.

378
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,840
你得丟下他
You gotta leave him!

379
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,200
湯瑪斯,不!
Thomas, no!

380
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,520
幹得好
Good job.

381
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
你剛剛害死自己了
You just killed yourself.

382
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,160
什麼?
What?

383
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,250
他怎麼了?
What happened to him?

384
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,080
他看來像怎麼了?
What does it look like?

385
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,920
他被螫了
He got stung.

386
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,920
他的頭怎麼了?
What happened to his head?

387
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,600
我做了該做的事
I did what I had to do.

388
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,720
好,幫我拉他起來
Okay. Okay, help me get him up.

389
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,120
我們得走了,迷宮已經在變化了
We gotta go. The maze is already changing.

390
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,770
米諾!
Hey, Minho!

391
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,760
我們不能把他丟在這裡
We can't just leave him here.

392
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,960
我們得拉他起來
We gotta get him up.

393
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,440
快點
Come on.

394
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,160
讓他坐下來
Just sit him down. Sit him down.

395
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,560
這樣行不通,我們得走了
This isn't going to work. We gotta go.

396
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:55,760
我們得走了!
We gotta go!

397
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:58,240
等等,你在說什麼?我們得把他藏起來
Wait, what are you talking about? We gotta hide him.

398
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,520
- 藏在哪裡?  - 我不知道
- Where?   - I don't know.

399
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,360
你是說我們哪裡都不能帶他去嗎?
Are you telling me there's not a single place we could take him?

400
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,680
瞎卡,聽我說
Listen to me, shuck-face, all right.

401
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,320
看看四周,這裡沒有地方去
Take a look around. There's nowhere to go!

402
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,290
你不懂
You don't get it.

403
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,440
我們等於死了
We're already dead.

404
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,690
二、三
Two, three...

405
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,400
二、三
Two, three...

406
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,400
好
Okay.

407
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,320
你在幹嘛?你在幹嘛?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

408
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,400
你在幹嘛?
What are you doing?

409
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,600
我們得走了,現在就得走了
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

410
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,600
不,再一點點,然後綁好
No, no, just a little more and we'll tie it off.

411
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,440
米諾,再一下子
Minho, stay with me.

412
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,330
米諾,加油啊
Stay with me, Minho.

413
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,970
再一點點就好,我們快好了
Just a little more, we're almost there.

414
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,640
- 菜鳥,對不起  - 怎麼了?
- I'm sorry, Greenie.   - What?

415
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:22,800
米諾!
Minho!

416
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,360
好
Okay.

417
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,160
快點
Come on.

418
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
靠
Oh, shit!

419
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,560
你這個瘋子
You're a crazy son of a bitch.

420
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,960
快點,跟我來,快點!
Come on, follow me. Come on!

421
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,400
好,迷宮在變化了,快點
Okay, it's changing. Come on, come on!

422
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,680
這一區要關閉了,來吧
This section is closing. Come on.

423
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:21,520
我們在這裡能甩掉鬼火獸
We can lose it down here!

424
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,360
湯瑪斯!
Thomas!

425
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,010
你還在等什麼?快離開
What are you waiting for? Get out of there!

426
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,040
來吧
Come on!

427
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,640
來吧!
Come on!

428
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,160
快點,湯瑪斯,不要回頭
Come on, Thomas! Don't look back!

429
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,040
快跑!
Run!

430
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,050
快走,湯瑪斯,快跑啊
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

431
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,960
快動作,走了,快點
Move your ass! Let's go! Come on!

432
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,040
來吧,菜鳥,走了
Come on, Greenie! Let's go!

433
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:57,010
湯瑪斯!
Thomas!

434
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,120
大家過來
Guys, get up!

435
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,320
查克,我告訴過你了
I told you, Chuck.

436
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,520
他們不會回來了
They're not coming back.

437
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,890
走吧
Let's go.

438
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,600
不會吧
No way.

439
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,570
我抓住他了
I got him, I got him, I got him.

440
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:53,600
注意,小心
Watch out. Easy.

441
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,460
裡面發生什麼事了?
What happened out there?

442
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,400
你們怎麼出來的?
How did you guys make it out?

443
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,200
你看到鬼火獸了?
You saw a Griever?

444
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,600
對,我看到一隻了
Yeah, I saw one.

445
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,280
他不只是看到
He didn't just see it.

446
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
他殺死鬼火獸了
He killed it.

447
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,040
情況起了變化
Things are changing.

448
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,640
這一點不能否認
There's no denying that.

449
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,400
首先,本在大白天被螫
First, Ben gets stung in broad daylight.

450
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,640
接著是艾爾比
And then Alby.

451
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,240
現在,我們的菜鳥接下責任
And now our Greenie, here, has taken it upon himself...

452
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,970
進了迷宮
to go into the maze.

453
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,480
這明顯違反我們的規定
Which is a clear violation of our rules here.

454
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,480
對...
Yeah...

455
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,480
可是他救了艾爾比一命
but he saved Alby's life.

456
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:49,760
是嗎?
Did he?

457
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,840
三年來,我們跟鬼火獸和平共存
For 3 years, we have coexisted with these things.

458
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,000
現在,你殺了一隻鬼火獸
And now, you've killed one of them.

459
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,080
誰知道這對我們代表什麼意義
Who knows what that could mean for us.

460
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,080
你建議我們該怎麼做?
What do you suggest we do?

461
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,250
他必須受到處罰
He has to be punished.

462
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,010
- 拜託  - 他殺了一隻鬼火獸耶
- Come on.   - He killed a Griever!

463
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
米諾
Minho.

464
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:16,120
你跟他一起進了迷宮,你怎麼想?
You were there with him. What do you think?

465
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,520
我想...
I think...

466
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:24,600
我們在這裡待了這麼久
in all the time we've been here...

467
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,650
沒有人殺死過鬼火獸
no one has ever killed a Griever before.

468
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,840
我轉身落跑時
When I turned tail and ran...

469
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,280
這個蠢遜客留下來救艾爾比
this dumb shank stayed behind to help Alby.

470
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,810
我不知道他是勇敢還是蠢
Look, I don't know if he's brave or stupid.

471
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,520
但不管是什麼,都是我們需要的
But whatever it is, we need more of it.

472
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,360
我們就讓他當飛毛腿吧
I say we make him a runner.

473
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,640
飛毛腿?什麼?
A runner? What?

474
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,000
米諾,先別急
Minho, let's not jump the gun, here.

475
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,050
湯瑪斯!
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

476
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,200
你們要替菜鳥歡呼,沒關係
If you want to throw the newbie a parade, that's fine.

477
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,040
儘管歡呼
Go ahead.

478
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,850
但我很瞭解迷宮的一點
But if there is one thing I know about the maze...

479
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,240
那就是你不能...
it is that you do not...

480
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,840
好,等等,我認得那個聲音
Okay, wait. I know that sound.

481
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,200
- 箱子又上來了  - 怎麼可能
- The Box. It's coming back up.   - It shouldn't be.

482
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,920
紐特,你看到什麼?
Newt, what do you see?

483
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,440
你有看到嗎?
Do you see it?

484
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,440
是個女的
It's a girl.

485
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:46,920
怎麼可能
No way.

486
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,760
我覺得她死了
I think she's dead.

487
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,960
她手上拿了什麼?
What's in her hand?

488
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,080
"她是最後一個"
"She's the last one... ever."

489
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,560
這是什麼鬼意思?
What the hell does that mean?

490
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,080
湯瑪斯...
Thomas...

491
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,240
你們還是覺得我反應過度嗎?
Do you still think I'm overreacting?

492
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:55,600
傑夫,怎麼回事?
Jeff, what's going on?

493
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,800
她是怎麼了?她為何醒不過來?
What's the matter with her? Why won't she wake up?

494
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,960
你問我該問誰?
Hey man, I got my job the same way you did.

495
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,770
你認得她嗎?
Do you recognize her?

496
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:10,760
不認得
No.

497
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,040
真的?因為她似乎認得你
Really? Because she seemed to recognize you.

498
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,680
紙條的事呢?
What about the note?

499
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:20,040
晚點再來擔心紙條的事
We'll worry about the note later.

500
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,520
我認為你應該現在擔心
I think you should worry about it now.

501
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,320
我們現在要處理的事已經夠多了
We've got enough to deal with at the moment.

502
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,200
紐特,他說的對
He's right, Newt.

503
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,810
如果箱子不再上來了
If the Box isn't coming back up,

504
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,370
你覺得我們能撐多久?
how long do you think we can last?

505
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,040
沒人說箱子不會上來了
No one said that.

506
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:37,840
先別亂下結論
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

507
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,280
我們等她醒來,瞭解她知道什麼後再說
We'll just wait until she wakes up and see what she knows.

508
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:45,880
一定有人知道答案
Somebody has gotta have some answers around here.

509
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,680
好
Okay.

510
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,840
- 你要去哪?  - 回去迷宮
- Where are you going?   - Back into the maze.

511
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:01,090
湯瑪斯
Hey, Thomas.

512
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,320
你是怎麼了?想找死嗎?
What is this with you, huh? A death wish?

513
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,640
你才剛出來就想回去?
You just got out and now you want back in?

514
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,840
紐特說沒人看過鬼火獸後
Newt said that no one has ever seen a Griever

515
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,840
還能活著聊鬼火獸嗎?
and lived to tell about it, right?

516
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,400
米諾,我們現在有一個了
Minho, now we have one.

517
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,600
你是說你一點都不好奇嗎?
You're telling me you're not even a little bit curious?

518
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,360
並沒有
Not really, no.

519
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,600
你有什麼計畫?
So, what's the plan?

520
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,680
你要去靠自己支解鬼火獸嗎?
You're gonna go out and dissect that thing all by yourself?

521
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,600
必要的話,我會
I will if I have to.

522
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,280
其他的飛毛腿離開了嗎?
Have the other runners left yet?

523
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,600
其他的飛毛腿今天早上都不幹了
The other runners quit this morning.

524
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,440
艾爾比被螫後
After Alby got stung, they're not

525
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,120
他們不急著回迷宮
in any hurry to get back out there.

526
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:44,960
你為何急著回去?
Why are you?

527
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,600
我覺得我們也該瞭解我們面對的到底是什麼了
I think it's time we find out what we're really up against.

528
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:54,760
好吧
All right.

529
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:57,120
但你不能獨自回迷宮
But you're not going back out there alone.

530
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,640
半小時後到樹林找我
Meet me in the woods in half-an-hour.

531
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,120
這樣夠嗎?
Will this be enough?

532
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,000
好
Okay.

533
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,650
走吧
Let's go.

534
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,480
快點
Come on!

535
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,520
好噁心
That's disgusting.

536
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,370
裡面有東西
There's something in there.

537
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,280
你是說除了鬼火獸松餅以外嗎?
You mean, besides a Griever pancake?

538
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,960
你在幹嘛?
Whoa, what are you doing?

539
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,040
你不是說它死了嗎?
I thought you said it was dead.

540
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:49,880
- 是反射動作嗎?  - 最好是啦
- Was it a reflex?   - You hope.

541
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:54,160
來吧,想辦法把它拔出來吧
Okay, come on. Let's try and pull it out.

542
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,520
大家一起出力,來吧
Everyone get a hand on it. Come on.

543
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,400
準備好了嗎?數到三來
All right, ready? On three.

544
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,360
一、二、三
One, two, three!

545
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,640
- 煎鍋,你沒事吧?  - 沒事,謝了,兄弟
- Are you okay, Fry?   - Yeah. Thanks, brother.

546
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:48,200
那是什麼鬼東西?
What the hell is that?

547
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,560
有意思
Interesting.

548
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,080
好,不管那是什麼
Okay, whatever it is...

549
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:02,160
我們能回迷宮幽地再討論嗎?
can we take this up back at the Glade?

550
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:04,850
因為我可不想看到這傢伙的朋友
Because I don't want to meet this guy's friends.

551
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,520
他說的對
He's right.

552
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:09,360
時間晚了,走吧
It's getting late. Come on.

553
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:21,800
我們找到這個
We found this.

554
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,880
它在鬼火獸的體內
It was inside a Griever.

555
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,640
- 我們的物資上有一樣的字  - 對
- These are the same letters we get in our supplies.   - Yeah.

556
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,160
把我們放在這裡的人
Whoever put us here obviously made the Grievers.

557
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,760
顯然創造了鬼火獸
This is the first real clue,

558
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:34,520
這是第一條真線索,三年多來第一次有收穫
the first anything, you've found in over 3 years.

559
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:35,880
米諾,對嗎?
Right, Minho?

560
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,160
對
Right.

561
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,080
紐特,我們得回迷宮
Newt, we gotta go back out there.

562
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:43,170
誰知道這能讓我們找到什麼
Who knows where this might lead us.

563
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,520
你知道他想幹嘛,對嗎?
You see what he's trying to do, right?

564
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,680
先是破壞我們的規定
First he breaks our rules...

565
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:52,490
然後說服我們完全放棄規定
and then he tries to convince us to abandon them totally.

566
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,320
只有規定能讓大家凝聚在一起
The rules are the only thing that have ever held us together.

567
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,920
我們現在為何要質疑這一點?
Why now are we questioning that?

568
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,640
如果艾爾比在這裡,你知道他會同意我的話
If Alby was here, you know he'd agree with me.

569
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:04,000
這個遜客必須受罰
This shank needs to be punished.

570
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,040
說的對
You're right.

571
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,920
湯瑪斯是打破規定
Thomas broke the rules.

572
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,850
把他關進大籠子一晚,不准吃飯
One night in the pit, and no food.

573
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,730
拜託,紐特,關進大籠子一晚?
Come on, Newt! One night in the pit?

574
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,200
你覺得這會阻止他進迷宮嗎?
Do you think that's gonna stop him from going into the maze?

575
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,520
不會
No.

576
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,320
我們不能讓非飛毛腿想去迷宮就去
And we can't just have non-runners running into the maze whenever they feel like it.

577
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,680
我們正式搞定這件事吧
So let's just make this official.

578
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,240
從明天起,你就是飛毛腿了
Starting from tomorrow, you're a runner.

579
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,600
- 蓋裡...  - 煎鍋,別說了
- Gally...   -  No, Fry.

580
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,680
紐特,謝了
Thanks, Newt.

581
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,810
我們要去哪?
Hey, where are we going?

582
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,040
你待會就知道了
You'll see.

583
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,000
這是迷宮
It's the maze.

584
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,640
整座迷宮
All of it.

585
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,880
整座迷宮是啥意思?你們不是還在畫地圖嗎?
What do you mean "all of it"? I thought you were still mapping it.

586
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:51,800
沒有東西可以畫了
There's nothing left to map.

587
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,280
我親自把每一寸都跑遍了
I've run every inch of it myself.

588
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,760
每個迴圈
Every cycle.

589
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:59,400
每個模式都是
Every pattern.

590
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:04,480
如果有出路,我們早就找到了
If there was a way out, we would have found it by now.

591
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,800
你為何沒跟任何人說這件事?
Why haven't you told anyone this?

592
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,960
這是艾爾比的決定
It was Alby's call.

593
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:16,010
大家必須相信我們有機會離開
People needed to believe we had a chance of getting out.

594
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,000
但或許現在...
But maybe now...

595
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,760
我們是真的有機會了
we have a real chance.

596
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:28,520
你看一下這個
Take a look at this.

597
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,410
一年前,我們開始探索這些週邊的區
About a year ago, we started exploring these outer sections.

598
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,610
我們發現牆上印了這些號碼
We found these numbers printed on the walls.

599
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:38,330
第一區到第八區
Sections 1 through 8.

600
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:39,760
它的運作方式是每天晚上
See, the way it works,

601
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,280
迷宮起變化時
is every night, when the maze changes...

602
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,320
會打開一個新的區
it opens up a new section.

603
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:46,920
所以今天打開的是第六區
So today, Section 6 was open.

604
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:50,760
明天是第四區,接著是第八區,然後是第三區
Tomorrow, it will be 4, then 8, then 3.

605
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,240
模式永遠不變
The pattern always stays the same.

606
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,480
第七區哪裡特別了?
What's so special about 7?

607
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,080
我不知道
I don't know.

608
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:03,040
但昨晚,在你殺死那只鬼火獸時
But last night, when you killed that Griever...

609
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,680
第七區開啟了
Section 7 was open.

610
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,360
我認為鬼火獸一定從那裡來
I think it must be where it comes from.

611
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:10,240
明天,你跟我要過去了解
Tomorrow, you and I are gonna take a closer look.

612
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,680
你們在幹嘛?你們不准進來的
What are you guys doing? You're not allowed in here.

613
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:18,440
- 抱歉,是...  - 是那女孩
- Sorry, it's just the, uh...   - It's the girl.

614
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,090
她醒了嗎?
Is she awake?

615
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:21,560
可以這麼說
You could say that.

616
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,240
查克,怎麼回事?
Chuck, what's going on?

617
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,080
女孩有夠棒
Girls are awesome.

618
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:28,400
別煩我
Leave me alone!

619
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:30,480
小心頭
Watch your head!

620
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:33,160
喂,你再丟石頭...
Hey, throw one more of those things... Ow!

621
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,760
- 走開  - 我們沒有惡意
- Go away!   - We come in peace!

622
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,920
- 發生什麼事了?  - 快閃
- What happened?   - Just duck!

623
00:55:36,080 --> 00:55:37,520
我覺得她不太喜歡我們
I don't think she likes us very much.

624
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,440
- 你們想怎樣?  - 我們只想談談
- What do you want from me?   - We just wanna talk.

625
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:40,760
我警告你們喔
I'm warning you!

626
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,490
大家快找掩護!
Take cover, y'all! Take cover!

627
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,920
我是湯瑪斯!
Hey, it's Thomas! It's Thomas!

628
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,760
我要上去,好嗎?
I'm gonna come up, okay?

629
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,480
好
Okay.

630
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,120
就我一個
Just me.

631
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,640
我上來了
I'm coming up.

632
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:16,640
好,就...
Okay, just...

633
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:18,160
別激動,好嗎?
Easy, all right?

634
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,490
我在哪裡?
Where am I?

635
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:22,480
這是什麼地方?
What is this place?

636
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:23,970
我為何什麼都記不得了?
Why can't I remember anything?

637
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:26,880
這都很正常,好嗎?我們全都經歷過
This is all normal. Okay? We've all been through this.

638
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,160
好嗎?
Okay?

639
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,320
你過兩天就會想起你的名字
Your name will come back to you in a couple of days.

640
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,320
- 這件事...  - 特蕾莎
- It's the one thing that...   - Teresa.

641
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:35,800
你說什麼?
What did you say?

642
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,160
我的名字
My name.

643
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,800
我叫特蕾莎
It's Teresa.

644
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:43,240
特蕾莎,我是湯瑪斯
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

645
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:49,200
但我猜你已經知道了吧?
But you already knew that, though, I guess, huh?

646
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,320
他們說我在睡夢中一直喊你的名字
They said I kept saying your name in my sleep.

647
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,680
你是誰?
Who are you?

648
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,560
我不知道
I don't know.

649
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,080
我不記得了
I can't remember.

650
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:08,240
這裡的人都想不起任何事情
None of us here can remember anything.

651
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:11,680
我們都像你一樣醒來就在這裡了
We all woke up here just like you did.

652
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:14,520
我保證...
Hey, I promise...

653
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:19,440
我要把刀拿走
I'm gonna take this.

654
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:23,520
好
Okay.

655
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,530
上面情況怎麼樣?
What's going on up there?

656
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,880
她要下來嗎?
Is she coming down?

657
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:43,200
等我們一下,好嗎?
Hey, listen, you guys just give us a second, okay?

658
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:46,640
好
All right.

659
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,280
走吧
Come on.

660
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,880
女生都這樣嗎?
Is this what all girls are like?

661
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,970
這女的瘋了
That girl is crazy.

662
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:02,600
"她是最後一個",這是什麼意思?
"She's the last one." What does that mean?

663
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,410
我不確定
I'm not sure.

664
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,770
但你上來後,箱子就沒下去了
Ever since you came up, that Box hasn't gone back down.

665
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:13,320
我想這讓大家有點擔心
I just think it's got everyone a little worried.

666
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,120
尤其是蓋裡
Especially Gally.

667
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,600
他認為這是我的錯
He thinks it's my fault.

668
00:58:27,240 --> 00:58:29,240
你確定你不記得任何其他的事?
Are you sure you don't remember anything else?

669
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,010
我記得水...
I remember water...

670
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,690
感覺就像我溺水了
feeling like I was drowning.

671
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,920
那些臉孔直盯著我看
These faces staring at me.

672
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:46,440
一個女人的聲音說著重複的事
And this woman's voice saying the same thing over and over.

673
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,800
WICKED很好
"Wicked is good."

674
00:58:52,120 --> 00:58:54,850
自從我來這裡後,我就做著這些夢
Ever since I've been here, I've had these dreams.

675
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,120
我以為那是夢
Well, I thought they were dreams.

676
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,160
你...
You...

677
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,280
你在我的夢裡
You were there.

678
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:07,880
你在夢裡...
You were there...

679
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,010
你告訴我一切即將改變
and you told me that everything was gonna change.

680
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,960
這是什麼意思?
What does it mean?

681
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,160
我不知道,我只有夢到片段
I don't know. I just always get pieces.

682
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,480
其他人什麼都不記得嗎?
And the others don't remember anything?

683
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:25,640
不記得
No.

684
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:30,330
我們為什麼不一樣?
Why are we different?

685
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,160
我上來時口袋裡放了這個
These were in my pocket when I came up.

686
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,680
"WICKED很好"
"Wicked is good."

687
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:58,880
要是我們被送來這裡是有理由的呢?
What if we were sent here for a reason?

688
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:03,960
艾爾比
Alby.

689
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,160
我們甚至不知道這東西是啥
We don't even know what this stuff is.

690
01:00:07,360 --> 01:00:08,850
我們不知道是誰送來的
We don't know who sent it.

691
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:10,690
也不知道這為什麼跟你一起上來
Or why it came up here with you.

692
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:13,810
我們只知道,這東西可能害他沒命
For all we know, this thing could kill him.

693
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,490
他已經快沒命了
He's already dying.

694
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:17,520
看看他
Look at him.

695
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:21,360
情況不可能更糟了
How could this possibly make it any worse?

696
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,880
快點,這值得一試
Come on, it's worth a try.

697
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:29,720
好吧
All right.

698
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:31,720
動手吧
Do it.

699
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,200
好
Okay.

700
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,240
你不應該在這裡的!
You shouldn't be here! You shouldn't be here!

701
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:47,440
不!
No!

702
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:49,370
小心
Watch out!

703
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,720
拿針筒,放手
Get the syringe! Let go!

704
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:05,240
有效了
Well, that worked.

705
01:01:05,720 --> 01:01:07,000
好,從現在開始
Okay, from now on...

706
01:01:07,160 --> 01:01:10,240
讓一個人留下來全天候看著他
someone stays here and watches him around the clock.

707
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,840
菜鳥,天黑了,走吧
Sundown, Greenie. Time to go.

708
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:39,920
你對我到底有什麼意見?
Hey, what is your problem with me?

709
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:43,400
當你出現後一切都變了
Everything started going wrong the minute you showed up.

710
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:46,280
先是本,接著是艾爾比
First Ben, then Alby...

711
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,410
現在是那女孩
and now the girl.

712
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,040
大家都看到她認得你了
Everybody saw she recognized you.

713
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,640
我敢說你知道她是誰
And I'm betting you know who she is.

714
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,120
蓋裡
Gally...

715
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:18,760
你知道我們不能永遠待在這裡吧?
you know we can't stay here forever, right?

716
01:02:39,280 --> 01:02:40,280
誰在那裡?
Who's there?

717
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:42,560
是我啦
It's just me.

718
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,680
查克,抱歉
Sorry, Chuck.

719
01:02:44,840 --> 01:02:46,120
來
Here.

720
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,480
吃飽了比較有力氣
You'll run better on a full stomach.

721
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,440
查克,謝了
Thanks, Chuck.

722
01:03:07,640 --> 01:03:09,320
那是什麼?
Hey, what do you got there?

723
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,050
刻得挺好的
Wow, that came out pretty damn good.

724
01:03:18,360 --> 01:03:19,560
這是幹嘛用的?
What's that for?

725
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:23,000
要送給我爸媽的
It's for my parents.

726
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,760
你記得你的爸媽?
You remember your parents?

727
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,000
不記得
No.

728
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:31,000
我是說,我知道我一定有爸媽
I mean, I know I must have them.

729
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,040
不管他們在哪,我相信他們很想我
And wherever they are, I'm sure they miss me...

730
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:38,560
但我沒辦法想念他們,因為我不記得他們了
but I can't miss them because I don't remember them.

731
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:47,400
你覺得你明天進迷宮會發現什麼?
What do you think you're gonna find out there tomorrow?

732
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,250
我不知道
Uh, I don't know.

733
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,200
不過查克,如果有出路
But if there's a way out, Chuck,

734
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,080
我跟米諾會找到的
me and Minho are gonna find it.

735
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:04,600
拿去
Here.

736
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,440
查克,你幹嘛把木雕給我?
Chuck, why would you give this to me?

737
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:16,920
反正我也不記得他們
I can't remember them anyway.

738
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,250
但如果你找到出路
But maybe if you find a way out,

739
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,970
就能替我交給他們
you can give it to them for me.

740
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,410
睡吧
I'll let you get some sleep.

741
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:37,320
查克
Hey, Chuck.

742
01:04:38,120 --> 01:04:39,120
過來
Come here.

743
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,160
手伸出來
Put out your hand.

744
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,480
我要你自己交給你爸媽
I want you to give that to them yourself.

745
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,960
我們會離開這裡的
We're gonna get out of here.

746
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,480
全部的人都會
All of us.

747
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:56,800
好嗎?
Okay?

748
01:04:57,480 --> 01:04:58,970
我保證
I promise.

749
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:02,800
- 好  - 好
- Yeah.   - All right.

750
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:06,520
- 晚安  - 兄弟,晚安
- Good night.   - Good night, buddy.

751
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,490
菜鳥,今天是大日子
Big day, Greenie.

752
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,130
你確定你不要跳過?
Are you sure you don't wanna sit this one out?

753
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:28,360
- 拜託,讓我出去吧  - 好
- Come on, man. Get me out of here.   - All right.

754
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:47,960
走吧
Let's go!

755
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,880
往這裡,內圈快到了
This way. Not much further to the inner ring.

756
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,370
走吧
Let's go!

757
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:07,800
快點,走這裡
Come on! This way.

758
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:35,760
奇怪
That's strange.

759
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:36,880
怎麼了?
What?

760
01:06:37,040 --> 01:06:39,240
第七區應該下禮拜才會開
Seven is not supposed to be open for another week.

761
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,400
這是什麼鬼地方?
What the hell is this place?

762
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:51,160
我們叫它們刀片
We call them blades.

763
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,160
這是本的上衣吧?
It's Ben's, isn't it?

764
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,730
對
Yeah.

765
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:17,120
一隻鬼火獸一定把他拖到這裡了
A Griever must have pulled him down here.

766
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:49,360
我覺得它在指引我們方向
I think it's showing us the way.

767
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,560
- 等等...  - 幹嘛?
- Wait, wait, wait.   - What, what?

768
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:02,720
這裡,走
This way. Come on.

769
01:08:26,280 --> 01:08:29,040
米諾,你看過這個地方嗎?
Minho, you ever see this place before?

770
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:31,850
沒有
No.

771
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:55,400
這只是另一條死路
It's just another dead end.

772
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:24,490
你確定要進去嗎?
Are you sure about this?

773
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,280
不確定
Nope.

774
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,800
鬼火獸
Grievers.

775
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,290
那是什麼鬼?
What the hell was that?

776
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,800
我們得離開這裡
We gotta get out of here.

777
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,800
把鑰匙給我
Give me the key, give me the key!

778
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,720
快跑
Move, move!

779
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,160
我們得走了,湯瑪斯,快跑
We gotta go! Run, Thomas!

780
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:44,970
我們會被困住
We're gonna get trapped!

781
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:46,320
快走
Go! Go!

782
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:51,960
快走...
Go, go, go!

783
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,120
快跑
Move!

784
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:04,160
米諾!
Minho!

785
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:05,850
快點,快走...
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

786
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,800
快點跑!
Come on, move!

787
01:11:11,960 --> 01:11:13,960
繼續跑,快走
Keep going! Keep going! Let's go!

788
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,360
快走...
Go, go, go!

789
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,760
快走...
Go, go, go!

790
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,360
快點,別回頭
Come on! Don't look back!

791
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:49,480
快啊!
Come on!

792
01:11:52,120 --> 01:11:53,720
靠
Oh, shit!

793
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:56,400
往那裡
There! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

794
01:12:17,080 --> 01:12:18,440
剛剛發生什麼事了?
What the hell's going on out there?

795
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:19,880
湯瑪斯,你又幹了什麼好事了?
What the hell you done now, Thomas?

796
01:12:20,040 --> 01:12:21,530
我們發現一條新的通道
We found something, a new passage.

797
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,800
我們認為那可能是出路
We think it could be a way out.

798
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:24,720
- 真的嗎?  - 這是真的
- Really?   - It's true.

799
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:27,320
我們開啟一扇門,看到我從來沒看過的東西
We opened a door, something I'd never seen before.

800
01:12:27,480 --> 01:12:29,080
我認為鬼火獸白天一定躲在那裡
I think it must be where the Grievers go during the day.

801
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:30,440
等等!
Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa...

802
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:32,760
你是說你們找到鬼火獸的巢穴了?
You're saying you found the Grievers' home?

803
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,120
而且你們想要我們進去?
And you want us to go in?

804
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,770
它們進迷宮的路可能是我們的出路
Their way in could be our way out, Chuck.

805
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:38,280
對,另一邊也可能有十幾隻鬼火獸
Yeah, or there could be a dozen Grievers on the other side.

806
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:41,640
事實是湯瑪斯不知道自己在幹嘛,又來了
The truth is, Thomas doesn't know what he has done, as usual.

807
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,520
蓋裡,起碼我有做事
Yeah, at least I did something, Gally.

808
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:44,760
你做過什麼事了?
I mean, what have you done?

809
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,960
你只會一直躲在牆後
Aside from hide behind these walls all the time?

810
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,400
菜鳥,讓我告訴你一件事
Let me tell you something, Greenie.

811
01:12:48,560 --> 01:12:51,160
你才來三天,好嗎?我來三年了
You've been here 3 days, all right? I've been here 3 years!

812
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,480
對,你來三年了,現在還在這裡
Yeah, you've been here 3 years and you're still here, Gally!

813
01:12:53,680 --> 01:12:54,760
這告訴了你什麼?
What does that tell you?

814
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:56,410
或許你該開始改變做法了
Maybe you should start doing things a little differently.

815
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,640
或許你該主事,如何?
Maybe you should be in charge, what about that?

816
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,640
是艾爾比
Hey, it's Alby!

817
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,120
他醒了
He's awake.

818
01:13:04,280 --> 01:13:05,480
他有說什麼嗎?
Has he said anything?

819
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:06,800
沒有
No.

820
01:13:08,440 --> 01:13:09,960
艾爾比
Alby...

821
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,200
艾爾比,你還好嗎?
Alby, are you all right?

822
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:23,560
艾爾比
Hey, Alby.

823
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:28,970
艾爾比,我們可能找到離開迷宮的路了
Alby, we might have just found a way out of the maze.

824
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:32,920
你聽到我說話了嗎?我們可以離開了
Do you hear me? We could be getting out of here.

825
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:36,880
我們不能
We can't.

826
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:40,290
我們走不了
We can't leave.

827
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,520
他們不會讓我們走的
They won't let us.

828
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,090
你在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

829
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:47,360
我想起來了
I remember.

830
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,440
你想起來什麼了?
What do you remember?

831
01:13:55,120 --> 01:13:56,610
你
You.

832
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:03,080
湯瑪斯,你一向是他們的最愛
You were always their favorite, Thomas.

833
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:05,120
一向都是
Always.

834
01:14:09,240 --> 01:14:10,570
你為什麼要這麼做?
Why did you do this?

835
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:14,120
你為什麼要來這裡?
Why did you come here?

836
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:25,720
溫斯頓,怎麼了?
Winston, what's going on?

837
01:14:25,880 --> 01:14:27,960
迷宮的門沒有關閉
It's the doors. They aren't closing.

838
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:22,020
查克
Chuck,

839
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:25,040
去議事室把門擋住
go to the Council Hall and start barricading the doors.

840
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,920
- 溫斯頓,你跟他一起去  - 瞭解
- Winston, you go with him.   - Got it.

841
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:29,520
- 去找其他人  - 叫他們去樹林,快去躲起來
- Get the others.   - Tell them to go to the forest. Go hide, now!

842
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:32,080
米諾,我要你去拿所有的武器
Minho, I want you to grab every weapon you can find.

843
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:34,360
- 我跟你在議事室見  - 走
- I'll meet you at Council Hall.   - Let's go.

844
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:39,050
特蕾莎,你跟我去找艾爾比,好嗎?
Teresa, you and I are gonna go get Alby, all right?

845
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,360
好了,大家躲起來
All right, everybody hide!

846
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:49,760
特蕾莎!
Teresa!

847
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:52,920
快點,快跑!
Come on! Run! Run!

848
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:02,200
蹲低!
Stay down!

849
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,680
快跑
Run!

850
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,000
薩特!
Zart!

851
01:16:23,080 --> 01:16:26,120
- 救救我  - 快去村落
- Help me!   - Go! Get to the village!

852
01:16:33,040 --> 01:16:34,610
快走...
Go, go, go!

853
01:16:41,120 --> 01:16:42,770
蹲低!
Stay down, stay down!

854
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:45,720
蓋裡,讓我進去
Gally! Let me in, let me in!

855
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:54,200
- 艾爾比!  - 你沒事吧?
- Alby!   - Are you okay?

856
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,360
怎麼回事?
What's going on?

857
01:16:55,960 --> 01:16:58,080
- 它們來了  - 鬼火獸嗎?
- They're here.   - Grievers?

858
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,010
湯瑪斯,我們該怎麼辦?
Thomas, what do we do?

859
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:08,560
它螫到我了
It's got me!

860
01:17:13,320 --> 01:17:14,650
大家快跑
Everybody, run, run, run!

861
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,210
傑夫,快點,快走...
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

862
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,760
大家快走
Everyone, go, go, go!

863
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:53,160
繼續跑,靠
Keep moving! Oh, shit!

864
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,920
艾爾比
Alby!

865
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,560
躲到我後面
Get behind me!

866
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,410
來啊
Come on!

867
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,720
這裡,走吧
Over here, let's go!

868
01:18:06,880 --> 01:18:09,480
這裡!走吧,來吧
Over here! Let's go! Come on!

869
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:13,000
這裡,來啊
Over here, come on!

870
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:14,520
溫斯頓!
Winston!

871
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:15,840
扶艾爾比進去
Get Alby inside.

872
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:18,370
查克,進去!快走...
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

873
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,200
把門鎖上
Lock down the doors!

874
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,160
小心
Careful.

875
01:18:42,720 --> 01:18:43,960
大家退後
Stay back, guys.

876
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,400
大家都沒事吧?
Is everyone all right?

877
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:14,240
救命啊
Help!

878
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:16,160
- 快抓住他  - 救命啊
- Hey, grab him!   - Help!

879
01:19:19,160 --> 01:19:20,400
小心
Watch out!

880
01:19:27,040 --> 01:19:28,040
查克!
Chuck!

881
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,360
- 查克,不!  - 抓住他
- Chuck, no!   - Grab him!

882
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:33,600
把他拉回來
Pull him back!

883
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,610
- 救命啊  - 查克,別放手
- Help!   - Chuck, don't let go!

884
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,360
廢話
No shit!

885
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,400
- 快拉  - 別放開他
- Pull!   - Don't let him go!

886
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:03,050
- 查克,你沒事吧?  - 我沒事
- Chuck, are you okay?   - Yeah, I'm fine.

887
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:06,760
艾爾比,謝了
Thanks, Alby.

888
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,680
艾爾比,小心!
Alby! Watch out!

889
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:12,920
抓住他
Grab him!

890
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,720
湯瑪斯,帶他們出去
Thomas, get them out.

891
01:20:20,920 --> 01:20:21,960
艾爾比!
Alby!

892
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,720
不!湯瑪斯...
No! Thomas...

893
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:26,440
- 湯瑪斯!  - 別過去
- Thomas!   - Don't go out there!

894
01:20:26,600 --> 01:20:27,640
不,湯瑪斯,等等!
No, Thomas, wait!

895
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,440
湯瑪斯,等等!
Thomas, wait!

896
01:20:37,760 --> 01:20:39,280
大家去哪了?
Where is everybody?

897
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,160
是誰在那邊?
Who's that over there?

898
01:20:48,160 --> 01:20:50,120
蓋裡...
Gally...

899
01:20:51,080 --> 01:20:53,650
湯瑪斯,都是你害的,看看四周
This is all you, Thomas! Look around!

900
01:20:53,800 --> 01:20:55,450
蓋裡,別過來,這不是湯瑪斯的錯
Back off, Gally! It's not Thomas' fault!

901
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,520
你聽到艾爾比說什麼了
You heard what Alby said!

902
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,840
- 他是他們的一員  - 誰的一員?
- He's one of them!   - One of who?

903
01:20:58,040 --> 01:20:59,880
他是他們的人,他們派他來搞破壞
He's one of them, and they sent him here

904
01:21:00,000 --> 01:21:01,840
這下他成功了
to destroy everything, and now he has!

905
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,760
看看四周,湯瑪斯,看看四周啊
Look around, Thomas! Look around!

906
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:05,960
這都是你的錯
This is your fault!

907
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,800
蓋裡,別過來,這不是湯瑪斯的錯
Back off, Gally! This is not Thomas' fault!

908
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:10,640
你在鬼扯什麼?冷靜下來
What are you talking about? Calm down.

909
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:13,520
他們派他過來
They sent him here,

910
01:21:13,600 --> 01:21:14,880
他現在把我們打造的一切都毀了
and now he's destroyed everything that we've built!

911
01:21:14,960 --> 01:21:16,450
你在鬼扯什麼?
What are you talking about?

912
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,120
或許他說的對
Maybe he's right.

913
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:22,040
湯瑪斯...
Thomas...

914
01:21:23,160 --> 01:21:25,560
特蕾莎,我得想起過去的事
I need to remember, Teresa.

915
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,480
湯瑪斯...
Thomas...

916
01:21:27,640 --> 01:21:29,680
- 湯瑪斯!  - 不要!
- Thomas!   - No, don't!

917
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:32,360
湯瑪斯!
Thomas!

918
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,800
查克,拿另一支針筒來
Chuck, get the other syringe!

919
01:21:34,840 --> 01:21:36,490
沒事
It's okay.

920
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:38,360
湯瑪斯,我在這裡
Thomas, I'm here.

921
01:21:49,400 --> 01:21:50,480
是誰把我們放在這裡的?
Who put us here?

922
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:53,520
這一點我們不知道
That we don't know.

923
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,040
特蕾莎...
Teresa...

924
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:01,920
我們為什麼要這麼做?
why are we doing this?

925
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:07,000
湯瑪斯,很好
Excellent, Thomas.

926
01:22:07,160 --> 01:22:08,200
跟我來
Come with me.

927
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,760
湯瑪斯...
Wicked isn't good. Thomas...

928
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:13,440
WICKED很好
Wicked is good.

929
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:15,760
這怎麼會是我的錯?
How could this be my fault?

930
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:17,000
這是你害的!
You did this!

931
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:18,850
我看到你了!
I saw you!

932
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:23,040
我沒辦法一直看著他們沒命
I can't keep watching them die.

933
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,530
你還好嗎?
Are you okay?

934
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,720
你到底在想什麼?
What the hell were you thinking?

935
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:44,560
發生什麼事了?
What happened?

936
01:22:45,240 --> 01:22:46,730
蓋裡接管這裡了
Gally has taken control.

937
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:50,770
他說給我們一個選擇,不加入他...
He said we had a choice. Either join him...

938
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,600
就在日落時跟你一起被驅逐
or get banished at sundown with you.

939
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:57,240
其他人同意這麼做嗎?
And the others agreed to that?

940
01:22:58,280 --> 01:23:02,120
蓋裡說服大家這一切都是你的緣故
Gally has everyone convinced that you're the reason all this has happened.

941
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,240
他到目前為止沒說錯
Well, he's been right so far.

942
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:10,400
你到底在說什麼?
What are you talking about?

943
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:13,080
這個地方...
This place...

944
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,240
不是我們以為的那樣
it's not what we thought it was.

945
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,240
這不是監牢,這是測試
It's not a prison, it's a test.

946
01:23:21,080 --> 01:23:23,080
這從我們小時候就開始了
It all started when we were kids.

947
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:26,970
他們會給我們挑戰
They would give us these challenges.

948
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:30,120
他們拿我們做實驗
They were experimenting on us.

949
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:34,320
然後人們開始不見
And then people started disappearing.

950
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,290
每個月,一個接著一個,很規律
Every month, one after the other, like clockwork.

951
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,520
他們把這些人送去迷宮
They were sending them up into the maze.

952
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:42,360
對,但不是我們全部的人
Yeah, but not all of us.

953
01:23:42,920 --> 01:23:44,680
什麼意思?
What do you mean?

954
01:23:47,960 --> 01:23:49,610
各位,我是他們的一員
Guys, I'm one of them.

955
01:23:52,120 --> 01:23:54,640
我跟把你們放在這裡的人共事
The people who put you here, I worked with them.

956
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,200
我觀察你們好幾年了
I watched you guys for years.

957
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,450
你們在這裡的全部期間...
The entire time you have been here...

958
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:04,640
我都在另一邊
I was on the other side of it.

959
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,800
你也一樣
So were you.

960
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:11,840
什麼?
What?

961
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:15,800
特蕾莎,這是我們做的
Teresa, we did this to them.

962
01:24:17,800 --> 01:24:19,000
不
No.

963
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:21,810
這不可能是真的
That can't be true.

964
01:24:22,040 --> 01:24:25,400
這是,我看到了
It is. I saw it.

965
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,320
如果我們是同夥,他們為何要送我們上來?
Why would they send us up if we were with them?

966
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:31,480
不重要
It doesn't matter.

967
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:34,320
他說的對
He's right.

968
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:38,650
不重要
It doesn't matter.

969
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,160
這一切都不重要
Any of it.

970
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:46,320
因為來迷宮前的我們已經不存在了
Because the people we were before the maze don't even exist anymore.

971
01:24:46,480 --> 01:24:48,560
創造者解決掉了
These Creators took care of that.

972
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:53,400
我們現在是誰才重要
But what does matter is who we are now, and what we do...

973
01:24:53,560 --> 01:24:55,210
我們現在做的事也是
right now.

974
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,890
你進入迷宮找到出路
You went into the maze and you found a way out.

975
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,360
對,但如果我沒去,艾爾比也不會沒命
Yeah, but if I hadn't, Alby would still be alive.

976
01:25:05,760 --> 01:25:07,250
或許吧
Maybe.

977
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,360
但我知道如果他還活著
But I know that if he were here,

978
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,720
他會跟你說一樣的話
he would be telling you the exact same thing.

979
01:25:16,880 --> 01:25:20,120
解決問題,收拾殘局
Pick your ass up and finish what you started.

980
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,560
因為如果我們坐以待斃
Because if we do nothing...

981
01:25:23,760 --> 01:25:26,880
那就表示艾爾比白白犧牲了,我可不容許這種事
then that means Alby died for nothing, and I can't have that.

982
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:32,920
好
Okay.

983
01:25:34,720 --> 01:25:38,000
好,但我們得先過蓋裡那一關
Okay, but we gotta get through Gally first.

984
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,000
太可惜了
This is such a waste.

985
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:15,960
蓋裡...
Gally...

986
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:22,760
驅逐他們感覺不對
It doesn't feel right, man.

987
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,360
萬一湯瑪斯說的是對的呢?
Yeah, what if Thomas is right?

988
01:26:27,200 --> 01:26:29,280
說不定他能帶領我們回家
Maybe he can lead us home.

989
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,480
這裡就是家
We are home.

990
01:26:34,120 --> 01:26:35,770
好嗎?
Okay?

991
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:40,010
我不想再劃掉牆上任何一個名字了
I don't wanna have to cross any more names off that wall.

992
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,840
你真的認為驅逐我們能解決事情嗎?
You really think banishing us is gonna solve anything?

993
01:26:44,560 --> 01:26:45,970
不
No.

994
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:49,120
但這不是驅逐
But this isn't a banishing.

995
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,120
這是獻祭
It's an offering.

996
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,120
什麼?等等
What? Wait!

997
01:26:53,200 --> 01:26:55,240
蓋裡,你在幹嘛?
Gally, what are you doing?

998
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:57,200
你真的以為在湯瑪斯做出那種事後
You really think I'm gonna let Thomas

999
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,080
我會讓他回迷宮嗎?
back into the maze after what he has done?

1000
01:27:00,840 --> 01:27:02,520
看看四周
Look around you!

1001
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:04,920
看看我們的迷宮幽地
Look at our Glade!

1002
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,490
這是唯一的辦法
This is the only way.

1003
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:12,920
鬼火獸如願後
And when the Grievers get what they came here for...

1004
01:27:13,520 --> 01:27:15,640
一切就會恢復以往
everything goes back to the way it was.

1005
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,040
你們有在聽嗎?
Are you listening to this?

1006
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,680
你們光杵在那裡幹嘛?他瘋了
Why are you all just standing there? He's crazy!

1007
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,720
你給我閉嘴
You shut up. If you stay here,

1008
01:27:21,840 --> 01:27:23,040
留下來,鬼火獸就會回來
the Grievers are going to come back.

1009
01:27:23,240 --> 01:27:25,160
它們會一而再、再而三回來
They're gonna come back, and they're gonna keep coming back...

1010
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:26,480
直到你們全都死光
until you're all dead!

1011
01:27:26,640 --> 01:27:28,480
閉嘴,把他綁起來
Shut up! Tie him up!

1012
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,160
你們聽到我說話嗎?把他綁起來
Do you hear me? I said tie him up!

1013
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,800
你真是充滿驚奇啊
You're full of surprises, aren't you?

1014
01:27:59,200 --> 01:28:02,200
你不必跟我們走,但我們要離開了
You don't have to come with us, but we are leaving.

1015
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,640
想一起來的人,這是最後的機會
Anyone else who wants to come, now is your last chance.

1016
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:06,360
別聽他的,他只是想嚇唬你們
Don't listen to him, he's just trying to scare you.

1017
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,920
我不是想嚇唬你們,你們已經夠害怕了
No, I'm not trying to scare you. You're already scared.

1018
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:11,040
我很害怕
I'm scared.

1019
01:28:13,680 --> 01:28:14,960
但我寧可去外面冒險
But I'd rather risk my life out there

1020
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:16,720
也不想在這裡耗一輩子
than spending the rest of it in here.

1021
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:21,080
我們不屬於這個地方
We don't belong here.

1022
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,450
這裡不是我們的家
This place isn't our home.

1023
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,040
我們被人放在這裡
We were put here.

1024
01:28:27,440 --> 01:28:29,010
我們困在這裡
We were trapped here.

1025
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,000
起碼,我們在外面還有得選擇
At least, out there we have a choice.

1026
01:28:35,200 --> 01:28:37,280
我們出得去
We can make it out of here.

1027
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:39,560
我知道
I know that.

1028
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,440
對不起
I'm sorry.

1029
01:29:08,200 --> 01:29:10,600
蓋裡,事情結束了
Gally, it's over.

1030
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,760
跟我們走吧
Just come with us.

1031
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:25,720
祝你們對抗鬼火獸順利
Good luck against the Grievers.

1032
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,000
各位,往這邊
Everybody, this way!

1033
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:02,040
大家跟上,我們就快到了
Keep it up, guys, we're almost there!

1034
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:19,040
- 那是鬼火獸嗎?  - 對
- Is it a Griever?   - Yeah.

1035
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:21,280
靠
Shit.

1036
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:24,200
查克,這你拿著,跟在我們後面
You take this, Chuck. Stay behind us.

1037
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:28,880
沒事,跟緊我就對了
It's okay. Just stick with me.

1038
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:32,840
我們通過後,它就會啟動將門打開
Once we're through, it will activate and the door will open.

1039
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:35,120
我們團結在一起...
We stay close, we stick together...

1040
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,560
共度難關,現在就離開...
we get through this. We get out now...

1041
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,800
不成功便成仁
or we die trying.

1042
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:41,880
準備好了嗎?
Ready?

1043
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:45,360
好,走吧
All right. Let's go!

1044
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:02,360
起來,小心
Get up, look out!

1045
01:31:05,360 --> 01:31:06,360
進逼!
Push it!

1046
01:31:11,880 --> 01:31:12,880
小心
Look out!

1047
01:31:21,960 --> 01:31:23,160
鑰匙!
The key!

1048
01:31:23,320 --> 01:31:25,560
查克!小心邊緣
Chuck! Watch the edge!

1049
01:31:34,920 --> 01:31:36,840
- 查克,我罩你  - 拉我上去
- I got you, Chuck!   - Pull me up!

1050
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:48,680
快點
Come on!

1051
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,600
湯瑪斯!
Thomas! Thomas!

1052
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:53,160
查克?
Chuck?

1053
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:54,690
又有鬼火獸來了
We got more coming!

1054
01:31:56,280 --> 01:31:58,280
大家冷靜
Keep it steady, guys!

1055
01:32:00,520 --> 01:32:01,600
有用耶
It works!

1056
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,760
特蕾莎,走!
Teresa, go!

1057
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,960
- 別往後退,繼續進逼  - 團結在一起
- Don't back down! Keep pushing!   - Stay together!

1058
01:32:15,920 --> 01:32:17,440
一定有路可以出去,走吧
There's gotta be a way out! Come on!

1059
01:32:25,120 --> 01:32:26,120
小心
Watch it!

1060
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,480
門打不開
It won't open!

1061
01:32:36,760 --> 01:32:39,080
湯瑪斯! 有密碼
Thomas! There's a code!

1062
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,320
八個數字
Eight numbers!

1063
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:44,120
迷宮的八區
Eight sections of the maze.

1064
01:32:44,240 --> 01:32:47,240
- 米諾,順序是什麼?  - 什麼?
- Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?   - What?

1065
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:49,160
迷宮那些區的順序是什麼?
The sections of the maze, what's the sequence?

1066
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:52,010
七、一!
Seven! One!

1067
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,160
五、二!
Five! Two!

1068
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:56,160
- 六、四!  - 注意了
- Six! Four!   - Heads up!

1069
01:32:58,840 --> 01:32:59,920
米諾!
Minho!

1070
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
米諾!
Minho! Oh!

1071
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:04,760
放開我!
Get off of me!

1072
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,800
傑夫!
Jeff!

1073
01:33:18,520 --> 01:33:19,760
順序是什麼?快點?
What's the sequence? Come on!

1074
01:33:20,120 --> 01:33:22,640
六、四、八!
Six! Four! Eight!

1075
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,370
三!有了嗎?
Three! You got it?

1076
01:33:26,120 --> 01:33:27,530
撐住
Keep holding!

1077
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:28,920
快好了,快點
Almost there, come on!

1078
01:33:30,040 --> 01:33:31,120
門開了!
The door opened!

1079
01:34:58,120 --> 01:34:59,480
真的假的?
Seriously?

1080
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:44,680
這裡發生什麼事了?
What happened here?

1081
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,520
他們真的在監視我們
So they were watching us.

1082
01:36:21,720 --> 01:36:23,370
從第一天開始
This whole time.

1083
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,570
哈羅
Hello.

1084
01:36:50,720 --> 01:36:52,880
我是艾娃佩琪博士
My name is Doctor Ava Paige.

1085
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:58,280
我是災後世界狙殺平臺實驗處處長
I'm Director of Operations of the World Catastrophe Killzone Department.

1086
01:36:58,440 --> 01:36:59,850
如果你們正在收看
If you're watching this, that means

1087
01:36:59,920 --> 01:37:02,920
就表示你們已成功完成迷宮試驗
you have successfully completed the Maze Trials.

1088
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,520
我希望我能親自在場恭喜大家
I wish I could be there in person to congratulate you...

1089
01:37:08,240 --> 01:37:12,080
但情況似乎不容許
but circumstances seem to have prevented it.

1090
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,760
我相信大家現在一定非常困惑
I'm sure by now, you must all be very confused...

1091
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:16,640
憤怒
angry...

1092
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,290
害怕
frightened.

1093
01:37:18,440 --> 01:37:21,600
我只能向大家擔保,你們所經歷的一切
I can only assure you, that everything that's happened to you...

1094
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:25,040
我們對你們所做的一切
everything we've done to you...

1095
01:37:25,200 --> 01:37:27,240
都是有理由的
it was all done for a reason.

1096
01:37:27,920 --> 01:37:29,640
你們不會記得
You won't remember...

1097
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:32,560
但太陽烤焦了我們的世界
but the Sun has scorched our world.

1098
01:37:34,400 --> 01:37:36,880
幾十億人被大火燒死
Billions of lives lost to fire...

1099
01:37:37,760 --> 01:37:38,760
因饑荒而死
famine...

1100
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:42,250
全球飽受苦難
suffering on a global scale.

1101
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:45,400
結果不堪想像
The fallout was unimaginable.

1102
01:37:46,160 --> 01:37:48,810
之後的情況更糟
What came after was worse.

1103
01:37:49,600 --> 01:37:51,120
我們稱之為閃焰症
We called it the Flare.

1104
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,720
這個致命的病毒會侵襲大腦
A deadly virus that attacks the brain.

1105
01:37:55,880 --> 01:37:57,720
它劇烈...
It is violent...

1106
01:37:57,880 --> 01:37:59,400
不可預期...
unpredictable...

1107
01:38:00,240 --> 01:38:02,120
無法治療
incurable.

1108
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:04,970
我們原本以為如此
Or so we thought.

1109
01:38:06,640 --> 01:38:10,880
後來,能抵抗病毒的新生代出現
In time, a new generation emerged that could survive the virus.

1110
01:38:11,040 --> 01:38:14,560
突然間,人類又燃起治癒的希望
Suddenly, there was a reason to hope for a cure.

1111
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,490
但找到治療辦法並不容易
But finding it would not be easy.

1112
01:38:18,640 --> 01:38:21,760
年輕人得受到測試、甚至犧牲生命
The young would have to be tested, even sacrificed...

1113
01:38:22,120 --> 01:38:24,280
局限在嚴苛的環境內
inside harsh environments...

1114
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,480
他們的腦部活動才能接受研究
where their brain activity could be studied.

1115
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:28,970
大家都在努力瞭解
All in an effort to understand...

1116
01:38:29,120 --> 01:38:31,280
是什麼讓他們與眾不同...
what makes them different...

1117
01:38:32,480 --> 01:38:35,320
是什麼讓你們與眾不同
what makes you different.

1118
01:38:36,560 --> 01:38:38,600
你們或許不明白
You may not realize it...

1119
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,120
但你們非常重要
but you're very important.

1120
01:38:41,480 --> 01:38:44,320
不幸的是,你們的試煉才剛展開
Unfortunately, your trials have only just begun.

1121
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,520
你們不久後將發現
As you will no doubt soon discover,

1122
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:48,680
不是人人都同意本處的作法
not everyone agrees with our methods.

1123
01:38:48,840 --> 01:38:52,000
進步的過程緩慢,世人很懼怕
Progress is slow, people are scared.

1124
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,760
現在對我們或許為時已晚
It may be too late for us...

1125
01:38:54,840 --> 01:38:56,680
對我來說太晚
for me...

1126
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:58,200
但對你們來說並不是
but not for you.

1127
01:38:59,120 --> 01:39:00,920
外界在等待
The outside world awaits.

1128
01:39:01,520 --> 01:39:02,930
別忘了
Remember...

1129
01:39:06,360 --> 01:39:07,800
WICKED很好
Wicked is good.

1130
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,080
迷宮試驗結束了嗎?
Is it over?

1131
01:39:46,880 --> 01:39:48,840
她說我們很重要
She said we were important.

1132
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,520
我們現在該怎麼辦?
What are we supposed to do now?

1133
01:40:01,160 --> 01:40:02,760
我不知道
I don't know.

1134
01:40:08,160 --> 01:40:09,920
我們離開這裡吧
Let's get out of here.

1135
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:13,600
不
No.

1136
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:19,930
- 蓋裡?  - 不要過去
- Gally?   - Don't.

1137
01:40:21,040 --> 01:40:22,840
他被螫了
He's been stung.

1138
01:40:30,440 --> 01:40:31,770
我們無法離開
We can't leave.

1139
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,800
我們離開了,蓋裡,我們出來了
We did. Gally, we're out.

1140
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:40,200
我們自由了
We're free.

1141
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:43,720
自由?
Free?

1142
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,200
你認為我們在外面自由嗎?
You think we're free out there?

1143
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:51,640
不
No.

1144
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:56,080
我們無法逃離這個地方的
No, there's no escape from this place.

1145
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:02,720
蓋裡,聽我說
Gally, listen to me.

1146
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:05,160
你腦筋糊塗了
You're not thinking straight.

1147
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:06,920
真的
You're not.

1148
01:41:07,800 --> 01:41:09,800
我們可以幫你
Now, we can help you.

1149
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,320
把槍放下吧
Just put down the gun.

1150
01:41:14,120 --> 01:41:15,840
我屬於迷宮
I belong to the maze.

1151
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:17,720
把槍放下
Just put down the gun.

1152
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:22,160
我們都屬於迷宮
We all do.

1153
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,330
湯瑪斯...
Thomas...

1154
01:41:46,200 --> 01:41:47,610
查克
Chuck.

1155
01:41:52,280 --> 01:41:54,120
靠...
Oh, shit. Shit.

1156
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:56,530
看著我...
Look at me, look at me!

1157
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,880
靠
Oh, shit!

1158
01:41:59,040 --> 01:42:00,530
查克,看著我,好嗎?
Chuck, look at me, all right?

1159
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,200
有我在,兄弟,撐著點
I got you, buddy. Just hang on.

1160
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:04,210
沒事
It's okay.

1161
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:06,040
湯瑪斯...
Thomas, Thomas...

1162
01:42:11,520 --> 01:42:13,520
不,查克,你要親自交給你爸媽
No, Chuck. You're gonna give it to them yourself.

1163
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,680
記得嗎?我跟你說過了
Remember, I told you that.

1164
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:16,040
拿著
Take it.

1165
01:42:16,720 --> 01:42:17,840
不
No.

1166
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:21,400
謝謝
Thank you.

1167
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,560
謝謝
Thank you.

1168
01:42:26,880 --> 01:42:28,000
不,查克,你會好的...
No, Chuck, you're gonna get...

1169
01:42:32,720 --> 01:42:33,720
查克
Chuck.

1170
01:42:36,480 --> 01:42:38,080
查克?
Chuck? Hey.

1171
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:41,720
查克,別這樣
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1172
01:42:42,680 --> 01:42:44,280
快點,醒醒啊
Come on, wake up!

1173
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:53,080
天啊
Damn it!

1174
01:42:56,040 --> 01:42:57,960
我們逃出來了,別這樣
We made it. Come on.

1175
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:04,680
對不起
I'm sorry!

1176
01:43:05,920 --> 01:43:07,250
可惡!
God damn it!

1177
01:43:08,760 --> 01:43:10,600
可惡!
Damn it!

1178
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:17,760
- 湯瑪斯  - 查克
- Thomas.   - Chuck!

1179
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:23,680
查克,起來啊,快點
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1180
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,920
查克!
Chuck!

1181
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:41,440
你們不能把他丟在那裡
You can't just leave him there!

1182
01:44:19,280 --> 01:44:20,520
你們沒事吧?
You guys all right?

1183
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:22,400
別擔心
Don't worry.

1184
01:44:22,560 --> 01:44:23,920
你們安全了
You're safe now.

1185
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,800
(WICKED 基地A)


1186
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:02,090
小子,放輕鬆
Relax, kid.

1187
01:45:03,480 --> 01:45:05,800
一切即將改變
Everything is gonna change.

1188
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,920
我想我們可以說迷宮試驗大獲成功
I think it's safe to say the Maze Trials were a complete success.

1189
01:45:25,600 --> 01:45:27,960
我沒想到會有這麼多人存活,但...
I wasn't expecting so many survivors, but...

1190
01:45:29,000 --> 01:45:30,240
人愈多愈好啊
the more the merrier.

1191
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,400
湯瑪斯不斷讓人驚豔
Thomas continues to surprise and impress.

1192
01:45:39,760 --> 01:45:43,520
目前,他們似乎上鉤了
And for now, they seem to have taken the bait.

1193
01:45:44,640 --> 01:45:46,560
現在說可能還太早
It's too soon to say...

1194
01:45:48,240 --> 01:45:50,400
但他們可能是一切的關鍵
but they could be the key to everything.

1195
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:54,600
我們繼續吧
So let's move forward.

1196
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:59,440
該展開第二階段了

It's time now to begin Phase Two.
