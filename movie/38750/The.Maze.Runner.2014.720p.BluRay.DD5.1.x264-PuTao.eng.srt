1
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,350
Hello?

2
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,400
Hello?

3
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,232
Hey! Hey! Help me!

4
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,230
Go get him.

5
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,790
Day one, Greenie.

6
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,030
Rise and shine.

7
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,233
He looks like a slopper to me.

8
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,514
I could use some
help in the kitchen.

9
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,516
Oh!

10
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,159
Hey, we got a runner!

11
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,674
Oh!

12
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,516
Take it all in.

13
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,994
He's all yours.

14
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,150
Hey.

15
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,075
Hey there, Green Bean.

16
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,872
You're not gonna run again. Okay?

17
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,510
Good.

18
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,680
My name is Alby.

19
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,396
Can you tell me anything
about yourself?

20
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,516
Who you are?

21
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,673
Where you came from?
Anything at all.

22
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,750
No.

23
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,559
Can you tell me your name?

24
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,157
I, uh, I can't remember anything.

25
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,110
Why can't I remember anything?

26
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,156
It's okay.

27
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,835
Hey, relax.

28
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,196
Relax.

29
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,714
It's normal.

30
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,519
It happens to us all.

31
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,232
You'll get your name
back in a day or two.

32
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,237
It's the one thing
they let us keep.

33
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,713
What is this place?

34
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,510
Let me show you.

35
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,959
We eat here.

36
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,474
We sleep here.

37
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,994
We grow our own food.

38
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,594
We build our own shelter.

39
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,069
Whatever we need,
the Box provides.

40
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,276
The rest is up to us.

41
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,590
The Box?

42
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,877
Yeah. It's sent up once a month

43
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,316
with fresh supplies
and a new Greenie.

44
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,914
This month that's you.

45
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,560
Congratulations.

46
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,439
Sent up? By who, though?
Who put us here?

47
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,754
That, we don't know.

48
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,279
Hey, are you all right, Alby?

49
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,274
Green Bean, meet Newt.

50
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,113
When I'm not around,
he's in charge.

51
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,953
Well, it's a good thing
you're always around then.

52
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,112
That was some dash
you made earlier.

53
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,159
For a second, I thought you had
the chops to be a runner...

54
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,118
...till you face-planted.

55
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,475
That was great.

56
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,632
Wait, a "runner"?

57
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,360
Newt, do me a favor.
Go find Chuck.

58
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,794
- All right.
- Thanks.

59
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,838
Look, I'm sorry to rush this.

60
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,152
You came up a little late,
and there's a lot to do.

61
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,676
We got something special
planned tonight.

62
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,112
Yeah. You'll see.

63
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,791
I hope you're not
afraid of heights.

64
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,992
Let's go. Come on.

65
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,353
This is all we got.

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,353
We've worked hard for it.

67
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,795
If you respect this place...

68
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,837
you and I will
get along just fine.

69
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,719
What's out there?

70
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,839
We only have three rules.

71
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,509
First, do your part.

72
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,192
No time for any freeloaders.

73
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,034
Second, never harm another Glader.

74
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,271
None of this works
unless we have trust.

75
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,713
Most importantly...

76
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,116
never go beyond those walls.

77
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,877
Do you understand me, Greenie?

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,635
Hey, Alby!

79
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,995
Hey, Chuck. Where you been, man?

80
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,474
It's basically the same
story for all of us.

81
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,711
We wake up in the Box,
Alby gives us the tour...

82
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,233
then here we are.

83
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,074
Don't worry.

84
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,197
You're already
doing better than I did.

85
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,434
I clunked my pants three times

86
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,477
before they got me out of the pit.

87
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,719
No, come on.

88
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,230
Dude, where are you going?

89
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,590
I just wanna see.

90
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,230
You can look around all you want

91
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,919
but you better not go out there.

92
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,560
Why not? What's through there?

93
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,440
I don't know. I just
know what I'm told.

94
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,920
And we're not supposed to leave.

95
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,276
Hey, Chuck. New Greenie, huh?

96
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,280
How does it feel to be promoted?

97
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,920
Feels great, Ben.

98
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,437
I thought no one
was allowed to leave.

99
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,398
I said we're not allowed to leave.

100
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,040
They're different,
they're runners.

101
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,918
They know more about
the maze than anyone.

102
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,355
Wait, what?

103
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,789
What?

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,792
What? You just said "maze."

105
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,800
I did?

106
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,950
Yeah.

107
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,316
Where are you going?
What are you doing?

108
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,630
I'm just gonna take a look.

109
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,280
I told you, you can't.

110
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,955
No one leaves, especially not now.

111
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,276
It's not safe.

112
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,632
Okay, all right, I'm not gonna go.

113
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,236
Hey!

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,320
We gotta stop meeting
like this, Greenie.

115
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,709
Get off me!

116
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,916
All right! Calm, calm, calm.

117
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,070
Don't touch me!

118
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,833
Take it easy!

119
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,950
Just relax.

120
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,759
What the hell is
wrong with you guys?

121
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,956
Just calm down, all right?

122
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,077
No, okay? Why won't you
tell me what's out there?

123
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,674
We're just trying to protect you.
It's for your own good.

124
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,830
You guys can't just keep me here.

125
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,912
- I can't let you leave.
- Why not?

126
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,000
What the hell?

127
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,598
Next time, I'm gonna
let you leave.

128
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,914
Welcome to the Glade.

129
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,430
Light him up!

130
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,072
Hell of a first day, Greenie.

131
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,790
Here.

132
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,029
Put some hair on your chest.

133
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,869
Oh!

134
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,031
Oh, my God! What is that?

135
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,670
I don't even know.

136
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,679
It's Gally's recipe.

137
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,869
It's a trade secret.

138
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,878
Yeah, well, he's still an asshole.

139
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,519
He saved your life today.

140
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,073
Trust me. The maze
is a dangerous place.

141
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,989
We're trapped here, aren't we?

142
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,875
For the moment.

143
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,830
But...

144
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,876
you see those guys?

145
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,194
There, by the fire?

146
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,719
Those are the runners.

147
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,914
That guy in the middle
there, that's Minho.

148
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,439
He's the Keeper of the Runners.

149
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:15,355
Every morning, when those doors
open, they run the maze...

150
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,477
mapping it, memorizing it,

151
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,835
trying to find a way out.

152
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,839
How long have they been looking?

153
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,429
Three years.

154
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,874
And they haven't found anything?

155
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,432
It's a lot easier said than done.

156
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,350
Listen.

157
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,670
Hear that?

158
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,955
It's the maze, changing.

159
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,920
It changes every night.

160
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,037
How is that even possible?

161
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,680
You can ask the people
who put us in here,

162
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,877
if you ever meet the bastards.

163
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,071
Listen, the truth is...

164
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,674
the runners are the only ones

165
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,240
who really know what's out there.

166
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,551
They are the strongest and
the fastest of us all.

167
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,630
And it's a good thing, too...

168
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,837
because if they don't make it
back before those doors close...

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,912
then they are stuck out
there for the night.

170
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,440
And no one has ever survived
a night in the maze.

171
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,719
What happens to them?

172
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,637
Well, we call them Grievers.

173
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,994
Of course, no one's ever seen one

174
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,560
and lived to tell about it.

175
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,119
But they're out there.

176
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,996
Right, that's enough
questions for one night.

177
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,070
Come on.

178
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,755
You're supposed to
be the guest of honor.

179
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,599
- Oh, no...
- No! No, come on.

180
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,114
Let me show you around.

181
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,036
Come on.

182
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,879
And there we got the builders.

183
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,674
They're very good
with their hands...

184
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,752
but not a lot going on upstairs.

185
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,839
And then we got Winston...

186
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,197
he's the Keeper of the Slicers.

187
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,718
And we got two med-jacks,
Clint and Jeff.

188
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,439
- Hey, what's up?
- Yo, Newt.

189
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,600
They spend most of their time
bandaging up the slicers.

190
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,673
What if I want to be a runner?

191
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,035
Have you listened to
a word I've just said?

192
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,753
No one wants to be a runner.

193
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,037
And, besides,
you gotta get chosen.

194
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,236
Chosen by who?

195
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,870
What do you say, Greenie?

196
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,679
Wanna see what you're made of?

197
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,759
Greenie! Greenie! Greenie!

198
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,479
Okay. All right.

199
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,232
The rules are simple, Greenie.

200
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,914
I try to push you
out of the circle...

201
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,917
you try to last more
than five seconds.

202
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,878
- Take it easy on the Greenie.
- Ready?

203
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,795
Get up, boy.

204
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,156
Come on, Greenie.
We're not done yet.

205
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,916
Stop calling me Greenie.

206
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,430
Stop calling you that?

207
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,110
What do you wanna
be called? Shank?

208
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,116
What do you think, boys?

209
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,680
Does he look like a Shank?

210
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,196
Come on!

211
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,031
You know what? I think
I've settled on Shank.

212
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,070
Oh!

213
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,560
There you go, Greenie!

214
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,995
Not bad for a Greenie, huh?

215
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,550
Oh!

216
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,310
Thomas.

217
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,399
Thomas. Hey!

218
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,230
Thomas!

219
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,629
I remember my name. I'm Thomas!

220
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,670
Thomas!

221
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,834
Welcome home, Thomas.

222
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,240
Good job... Thomas.

223
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,235
What the hell was that?

224
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,074
That, my friend, was a Griever.

225
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,400
Don't worry, you're
safe here with us.

226
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,238
Nothing gets through those walls.

227
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,190
All right, guys.

228
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,357
Let's tuck it in for
the night. Come on.

229
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,840
It was a good night.

230
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,435
Good job, man.

231
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,030
<i>You're safe here with us.</i>

232
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,429
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

233
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,556
<i>What's out there?</i>

234
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,313
<i>Thomas, Thomas.</i>

235
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,755
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

236
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,394
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

237
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,030
Thomas.

238
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,876
Shh.

239
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,189
Follow me.

240
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,793
It's peaceful, isn't it?

241
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,994
I know it's hard to believe,
but it wasn't always this way.

242
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,113
We had dark days.

243
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,956
We lost a lot of boys to fear.

244
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,760
To panic.

245
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,112
We've come far since then.

246
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,194
Established order...

247
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,475
made peace.

248
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,674
Yeah. Why are you telling me this?

249
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,952
Because you're not
like the others.

250
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,394
You're curious.

251
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,878
But you're one of us now.

252
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,997
You need to know what that means.

253
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,233
What happened to them?

254
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,514
Like I said...

255
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,759
dark days, Thomas.

256
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,952
Has anyone tried
climbing to the top?

257
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,398
Tried it. The ivy doesn't
go all the way to the top.

258
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,752
And besides, where are
you gonna go from there?

259
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:46,916
And what about the Box?

260
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,229
You know, next time it comes up...

261
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,914
No, we tried that.

262
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,878
The Box won't go back
down with someone in it.

263
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,310
Okay, what if we...

264
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,595
No, we tried it, all right?

265
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,955
Twice.

266
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,920
All right? Trust me. Anything you
think of, we've already tried.

267
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,556
The only way out of here
is through the maze.

268
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,552
Now, look, you wanna be helpful?

269
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,110
Here.

270
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,112
Go dig us up some more fertilizer.

271
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,269
"Just get the fertilizer, Thomas."

272
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,439
"Are you sure, guys? I can't
help in any other way?"

273
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,717
"No, just get the fertilizer.

274
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,560
"You know where it is. It's just
out in the middle of the woods."

275
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,390
Oh!

276
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,630
You're Ben, right?

277
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,553
I don't know if we ever...

278
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,550
Are you okay?

279
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,640
Get the hell off me!

280
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,674
It's your fault.

281
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,234
I saw you.

282
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,754
You did this.

283
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,274
I saw you!

284
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,200
Hey! Hey!

285
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,514
Hey!

286
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,153
Help!

287
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,757
Help! Help!

288
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,270
Help!

289
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,270
I'll kill you!

290
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,800
Hey!

291
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,520
Hold him down.

292
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,433
What are you doing?

293
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,590
Calm down, Ben.

294
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,950
What the hell happened?

295
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,110
He just attacked me!

296
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,230
Are you okay?

297
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,390
Calm down, Ben.

298
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,433
No. No.

299
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,714
All right, lift his shirt.

300
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,837
Lift his shirt. No! No!

301
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,191
No! No! Please. Please.

302
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,680
He's been stung.

303
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,035
In the middle of the day?

304
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,200
Help me, please.

305
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,589
Please.

306
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,160
Please, just help.

307
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,750
Put him in the pit.

308
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,320
Everybody, help.
Take him to the pit.

309
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,079
No! Med-jack!

310
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,560
Please don't do it!

311
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,396
Calm down, Ben.

312
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,710
Back down, Ben.

313
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,958
Listen to me! Please!

314
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,033
Please, stop, please!

315
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,754
He did this!

316
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,674
Please stop! No!
No, please! Help me!

317
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,354
<i>So what happened to him?</i>

318
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,117
It's called "The Changing."

319
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,233
It's what happens
when someone gets stung.

320
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,190
Listen.

321
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,394
We haven't been able
to get a clear word

322
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,318
out of Ben since it happened.

323
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,317
He's not making any sense.

324
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,595
And it's only gonna get worse.

325
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,831
The infection is spreading.

326
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,718
He's dangerous.

327
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,317
What did he say to you?

328
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,439
He said he saw me...

329
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,671
and that this was all my fault.

330
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,231
How could this be my fault?

331
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,960
Get some rest.

332
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,840
- Alby?
- Yeah.

333
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,754
What's gonna happen to him?

334
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,277
Just listen to me.
Just, please, listen to me!

335
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,954
Please, Minho!

336
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,150
Alby!

337
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,317
No, please. Please, don't.

338
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,675
Please, don't do it.

339
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,556
Poles!

340
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,155
Move in!

341
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,197
No, no, no! Please!

342
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,834
No, please! Please, don't!

343
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,879
I can get better!
Please, just listen to me!

344
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,840
Please, stop, please!

345
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,114
Push him in! Stop!

346
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,114
I'll get better!

347
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,632
He belongs to the maze now.

348
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,272
Do you think he might make it?

349
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,240
Ben?

350
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,554
No.

351
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,600
No one survives
a night in the maze.

352
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,671
We just gotta forget about him.

353
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,960
<i>Thomas.</i>

354
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,997
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

355
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,960
<i>Don't make it easy on them.</i>

356
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:29,156
<i>Thomas.</i>

357
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,994
<i>Everything is going to change.</i>

358
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,359
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

359
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,833
<i>This is gonna hurt a little.</i>

360
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,190
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

361
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,040
<i>Thomas, you have to choose.</i>

362
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:16,591
But why would Alby
go into the maze?

363
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,071
I mean, he's not a runner.

364
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,720
Things are different now.

365
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:23,196
Alby went to retrace Ben's
footsteps before sundown.

366
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,350
Are you gonna help?

367
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,517
So he's gonna go back to
where Ben was just stung...

368
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,875
Alby knows what he's doing...

369
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,395
all right?

370
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,040
He knows better than any of us.

371
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,553
What does that mean?

372
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,516
Well, it's like
you have heard, yeah?

373
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,639
Every month, the Box
sends up a new arrival.

374
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,393
But someone had
to be first, right?

375
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,635
Someone had to have spent a whole
month in the Glade, alone.

376
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,152
That was Alby.

377
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,831
I mean, it can't have been easy.

378
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,150
But when those other boys started

379
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,833
coming up, one after the other...

380
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,992
he saw the truth.

381
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:05,356
And he learned that the
most important thing...

382
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,392
is that we all have each other.

383
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,517
Because we're all
in this together.

384
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,116
Yeah.

385
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,873
There you go, Greenie.

386
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,877
They should be back by now.

387
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,478
What happens if
they don't make it?

388
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,799
They're gonna make it.

389
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,953
What happens if they don't?

390
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,639
They're gonna make it.

391
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,758
Come on, guys, can't we
send someone after them?

392
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,320
That's against the rules.

393
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,350
Either they make it
back or they don't.

394
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,356
We can't risk losing anyone else.

395
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,714
Oh, no.

396
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:10,870
There!

397
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,190
Wait, something's wrong.

398
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,233
Come on, Minho, you can do it!

399
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,471
Come on! Go!

400
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,393
Come on, you can make it!

401
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,074
Minho, you gotta leave him!

402
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,799
They're not gonna make it.

403
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:31,037
You gotta leave him!

404
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,395
Thomas, no!

405
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,716
Good job.

406
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,392
You just killed yourself.

407
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,356
What?

408
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,439
What happened to him?

409
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,269
What does it look like?

410
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,119
He got stung.

411
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,113
What happened to his head?

412
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,796
I did what I had to do.

413
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,914
Okay. Okay, help me get him up.

414
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,311
We gotta go. The maze
is already changing.

415
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,960
Hey, Minho!

416
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,957
We can't just leave him here.

417
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,158
We gotta get him up.

418
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,634
Come on.

419
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,351
Just sit him down. Sit him down.

420
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,750
This isn't going to work.
We gotta go.

421
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,956
We gotta go!

422
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,430
Wait, what are you talking about?
We gotta hide him.

423
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,716
- Where?
- I don't know.

424
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,554
Are you telling me there's not a
single place we could take him?

425
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,879
Listen to me,
shuck-face, all right.

426
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,511
Take a look around.
There's nowhere to go!

427
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,480
You don't get it.

428
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,635
We're already dead.

429
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,879
Two, three...

430
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,594
Two, three...

431
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,596
Okay.

432
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,514
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

433
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,590
What are you doing?

434
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,798
We gotta go. We gotta go now!

435
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,794
No, no, just a little more
and we'll tie it off.

436
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,635
Minho, stay with me.

437
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,520
Stay with me, Minho.

438
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,160
Just a little more,
we're almost there.

439
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,834
- I'm sorry, Greenie.
- What?

440
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,990
Minho!

441
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,554
Okay.

442
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,354
Come on.

443
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,955
Oh!

444
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,954
Oh, shit!

445
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,752
You're a crazy son of a bitch.

446
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,158
Come on, follow me. Come on!

447
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:17,591
Okay, it's changing.
Come on, come on!

448
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:19,874
This section is closing. Come on.

449
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,713
We can lose it down here!

450
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,550
Thomas!

451
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:31,200
What are you waiting for?
Get out of there!

452
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,230
Come on!

453
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,836
Come on!

454
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,354
Come on, Thomas! Don't look back!

455
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,230
Run!

456
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,239
Move it, Thomas! Go on!

457
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,156
Move your ass! Let's go! Come on!

458
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,232
Come on, Greenie! Let's go!

459
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,200
Thomas!

460
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,316
Guys, get up!

461
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,513
I told you, Chuck.

462
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,717
They're not coming back.

463
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,080
Let's go.

464
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,794
No way.

465
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,070
Yeah!

466
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,070
Yes!

467
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,710
Yeah!

468
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,760
I got him, I got him, I got him.

469
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,798
Watch out. Easy.

470
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,598
What happened out there?
How did you guys make it out?

471
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,390
You saw a Griever?

472
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,792
Yeah, I saw one.

473
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,479
He didn't just see it.

474
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,632
He killed it.

475
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,233
Things are changing.

476
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,833
There's no denying that.

477
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,598
First, Ben gets
stung in broad daylight.

478
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,833
And then Alby.

479
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,431
And now our Greenie, here,
has taken it upon himself...

480
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,159
to go into the maze.

481
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,672
Which is a clear violation
of our rules here.

482
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,674
Yeah... but he saved Alby's life.

483
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,955
Did he?

484
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,037
For 3 years, we have
coexisted with these things.

485
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,192
And now, you've killed
one of them.

486
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,270
Who knows what that
could mean for us.

487
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,271
What do you suggest we do?

488
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,440
He has to be punished.

489
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,200
Come on. He killed a Griever!

490
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,350
Minho.

491
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,315
You were there with him.
What do you think?

492
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,713
I think...

493
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:24,793
in all the time we've been here...

494
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,839
no one has ever
killed a Griever before.

495
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,030
When I turned tail and ran...

496
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,477
this dumb shank stayed
behind to help Alby.

497
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,999
Look, I don't know
if he's brave or stupid.

498
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,710
But whatever it is,
we need more of it.

499
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,549
I say we make him a runner.

500
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,831
A runner? What?

501
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,198
Minho, let's not
jump the gun, here.

502
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,239
Thomas! Thomas! Thomas!

503
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,392
If you want to throw the
newbie a parade, that's fine.

504
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,233
Go ahead.

505
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,040
But if there is one thing
I know about the maze...

506
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,435
it is that you do not...

507
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,034
Okay, wait. I know that sound.

508
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,270
The Box. It's coming back up.

509
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,396
It shouldn't be.

510
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:40,110
Newt, what do you see?

511
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:41,634
Do you see it?

512
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:43,630
It's a girl.

513
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:47,110
No way.

514
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:52,952
I think she's dead.

515
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,154
What's in her hand?

516
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:11,272
"She's the last one... ever."

517
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,750
What the hell does that mean?

518
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,274
Thomas...

519
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,435
Do you still think
I'm overreacting?

520
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,789
Jeff, what's going on?

521
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,997
What's the matter with her?
Why won't she wake up?

522
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,153
Hey man, I got my job
the same way you did.

523
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,959
Do you recognize her?

524
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:10,950
No.

525
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,234
Really? Because she
seemed to recognize you.

526
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,870
What about the note?

527
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,235
We'll worry about the note later.

528
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,710
I think you should
worry about it now.

529
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:26,517
We've got enough to
deal with at the moment.

530
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,399
He's right, Newt.

531
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,999
If the Box isn't coming back up,

532
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:32,560
how long do you think we can last?

533
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:35,232
No one said that.

534
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,036
Let's not jump to any conclusions.

535
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,477
We'll just wait until she wakes
up and see what she knows.

536
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,069
Somebody has gotta have
some answers around here.

537
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,870
Okay.

538
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,034
Where are you going?
Back into the maze.

539
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:58,910
Hey.

540
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:01,280
Hey, Thomas.

541
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,512
What is this with you, huh?
A death wish?

542
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,831
You just got out and
now you want back in?

543
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,037
Newt said that no one
has ever seen a Griever

544
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,032
and lived to tell about it, right?

545
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,590
Minho, now we have one.

546
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,793
You're telling me you're not
even a little bit curious?

547
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,553
Not really, no.

548
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:26,794
So, what's the plan?

549
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,872
You're gonna go out and dissect
that thing all by yourself?

550
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:30,793
I will if I have to.

551
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,478
Have the other runners left yet?

552
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,791
The other runners
quit this morning.

553
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,634
After Alby got stung, they're not

554
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,313
in any hurry to
get back out there.

555
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:45,152
Why are you?

556
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,793
I think it's time we find out
what we're really up against.

557
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,954
All right.

558
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,316
But you're not going
back out there alone.

559
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,834
Meet me in the woods
in half-an-hour.

560
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,318
Will this be enough?

561
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,194
Okay.

562
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,840
Let's go.

563
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:49,669
Come on!

564
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,712
That's disgusting.

565
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:16,559
There's something in there.

566
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,471
You mean, besides
a Griever pancake?

567
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:30,151
What are you doing?

568
00:49:45,240 --> 00:49:47,232
I thought you said it was dead.

569
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:48,795
Was it a reflex?

570
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,075
You hope.

571
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:54,357
Okay, come on. Let's
try and pull it out.

572
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:56,713
Everyone get a hand on it.
Come on.

573
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,593
All right, ready? On three.

574
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:00,558
One, two, three!

575
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:11,839
- Are you okay, Fry?
- Yeah. Thanks, brother.

576
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,394
What the hell is that?

577
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:58,750
Interesting.

578
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:00,274
Okay, whatever it is...

579
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,358
can we take this up
back at the Glade?

580
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:05,040
Because I don't want to
meet this guy's friends.

581
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,714
He's right.

582
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,554
It's getting late. Come on.

583
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:21,990
We found this.

584
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:25,076
It was inside a Griever.

585
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:27,835
These are the same letters we
get in our supplies. Yeah.

586
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,357
Whoever put us here obviously
made the Grievers.

587
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:32,954
This is the first real clue,

588
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,713
the first anything, you've
found in over 3 years.

589
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,075
Right, Minho?

590
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:37,355
Right.

591
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,275
Newt, we gotta go back out there.

592
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,360
Who knows where
this might lead us.

593
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,712
You see what he's
trying to do, right?

594
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:49,875
First he breaks our rules...

595
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,680
and then he tries to convince
us to abandon them totally.

596
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:55,510
The rules are the only thing
that have ever held us together.

597
00:51:55,720 --> 00:51:58,110
Why now are we questioning that?

598
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:00,836
If Alby was here, you
know he'd agree with me.

599
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,192
This shank needs to be punished.

600
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,236
You're right.

601
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,119
Thomas broke the rules.

602
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:17,040
One night in the pit, and no food.

603
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,920
Come on, Newt!
One night in the pit?

604
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,390
Do you think that's gonna stop
him from going into the maze?

605
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,710
No.

606
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:25,439
And we can't just have non-runners

607
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,512
running into the maze
whenever they feel like it.

608
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:30,874
So let's just make this official.

609
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,430
Starting from tomorrow,
you're a runner.

610
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,590
Wow.

611
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:41,799
- Gally...
- No, Fry.

612
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,875
Thanks, Newt.

613
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,000
Hey, where are we going?

614
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,231
You'll see.

615
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,193
It's the maze.

616
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,834
All of it.

617
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,072
What do you mean "all of it"? I
thought you were still mapping it.

618
00:53:50,320 --> 00:53:51,993
There's nothing left to map.

619
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:55,476
I've run every inch of it myself.

620
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:57,954
Every cycle.

621
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,594
Every pattern.

622
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,750
If there was a way out,

623
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,672
we would have found it by now.

624
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,996
Why haven't you told anyone this?

625
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:13,156
It was Alby's call.

626
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,199
People needed to believe we
had a chance of getting out.

627
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,195
But maybe now...

628
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:21,954
we have a real chance.

629
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:28,715
Take a look at this.

630
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,600
About a year ago, we started
exploring these outer sections.

631
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:35,799
We found these numbers
printed on the walls.

632
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:38,520
Sections 1 through 8.

633
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:39,955
See, the way it works,

634
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,470
is every night,
when the maze changes...

635
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,518
it opens up a new section.

636
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:47,115
So today, Section 6 was open.

637
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,956
Tomorrow, it will be 4,
then 8, then 3.

638
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,430
The pattern always stays the same.

639
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,672
What's so special about 7?

640
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,274
I don't know.

641
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,232
But last night, when you
killed that Griever...

642
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,872
Section 7 was open.

643
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:08,555
I think it must be
where it comes from.

644
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,439
Tomorrow, you and I are
gonna take a closer look.

645
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:13,670
Hey!

646
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:15,872
What are you guys doing?
You're not allowed in here.

647
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,360
Sorry, it's just the, uh...

648
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,635
It's the girl.

649
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,280
Is she awake?

650
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:21,750
You could say that.

651
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,432
Chuck, what's going on?

652
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,271
Girls are awesome.

653
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,589
Leave me alone!

654
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,672
Watch your head!

655
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:33,355
Hey, throw one more
of those things...

656
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:34,954
Go away! We come in peace!

657
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,110
What happened? Just duck!

658
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:37,714
I don't think she
likes us very much.

659
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:39,633
What do you want from me?
We just wanna talk.

660
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:40,950
I'm warning you!

661
00:55:41,120 --> 00:55:42,679
Take cover, y'all! Take cover!

662
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,111
Hey, it's Thomas! It's Thomas!

663
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,957
I'm gonna come up, okay?

664
00:55:58,680 --> 00:55:59,670
Okay.

665
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:02,314
Just me.

666
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,834
I'm coming up.

667
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:16,830
Okay, just...

668
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,354
Easy, all right?

669
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,680
Where am I?

670
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,672
What is this place?

671
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,160
Why can't I remember anything?

672
00:56:24,320 --> 00:56:27,074
This is all normal. Okay?
We've all been through this.

673
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,350
Okay?

674
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,517
Your name will come back to
you in a couple of days.

675
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,512
It's the one thing that... Teresa.

676
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:35,990
What did you say?

677
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,355
My name.

678
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,992
It's Teresa.

679
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:43,433
Teresa, I'm Thomas.

680
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:49,398
But you already knew that,
though, I guess, huh?

681
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:53,513
They said I kept saying
your name in my sleep.

682
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:54,875
Who are you?

683
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,749
I don't know.

684
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,272
I can't remember.

685
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:08,433
None of us here can
remember anything.

686
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,871
We all woke up here
just like you did.

687
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,714
Hey, I promise...

688
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:19,633
I'm gonna take this.

689
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:23,710
Okay.

690
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:26,719
What's going on up there?

691
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,073
Is she coming down?

692
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:33,916
Um...

693
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:43,389
Hey, listen, you guys just
give us a second, okay?

694
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:46,830
All right.

695
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,470
Come on.

696
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,077
Is this what all girls are like?

697
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:55,159
That girl is crazy.

698
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,798
"She's the last one."
What does that mean?

699
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,600
I'm not sure.

700
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,236
Ever since you came up,

701
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:08,959
that Box hasn't gone back down.

702
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:13,514
I just think it's got
everyone a little worried.

703
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,319
Especially Gally.

704
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,792
He thinks it's my fault.

705
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,432
Are you sure you don't
remember anything else?

706
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,200
I remember water...

707
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,879
feeling like I was drowning.

708
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,112
These faces staring at me.

709
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:46,635
And this woman's voice saying
the same thing over and over.

710
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,995
"Wicked is good."

711
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,040
Ever since I've been here,
I've had these dreams.

712
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,317
Well, I thought they were dreams.

713
00:59:00,360 --> 00:59:01,350
You...

714
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,472
You were there.

715
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,070
You were there...

716
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:11,199
and you told me that
everything was gonna change.

717
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,153
What does it mean?

718
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,358
I don't know.
I just always get pieces.

719
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,670
And the others don't
remember anything?

720
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:25,830
No.

721
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:30,519
Why are we different?

722
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:40,351
These were in my
pocket when I came up.

723
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,790
"W.C.K.D."

724
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,877
"Wicked is good."

725
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,070
What if we were
sent here for a reason?

726
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,156
Alby.

727
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,352
We don't even
know what this stuff is.

728
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,040
We don't know who sent it.

729
01:00:09,240 --> 01:00:10,879
Or why it came up here with you.

730
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,999
For all we know, this
thing could kill him.

731
01:00:14,200 --> 01:00:15,680
He's already dying.

732
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:17,710
Look at him.

733
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:21,554
How could this possibly
make it any worse?

734
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,076
Come on, it's worth a try.

735
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,914
All right.

736
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,915
Do it.

737
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:42,390
Okay.

738
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:46,438
You shouldn't be here!
You shouldn't be here!

739
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:47,636
No!

740
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,560
Watch out!

741
01:00:52,080 --> 01:00:53,912
Get the syringe! Let go!

742
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:05,438
Well, that worked.

743
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:07,195
Okay, from now on...

744
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:10,432
someone stays here and watches
him around the clock.

745
01:01:14,960 --> 01:01:16,280
Hey.

746
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,034
Sundown, Greenie. Time to go.

747
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,116
Hey, what is your problem with me?

748
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,594
Everything started going wrong
the minute you showed up.

749
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,471
First Ben, then Alby...

750
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:48,600
and now the girl.

751
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:52,232
Everybody saw she recognized you.

752
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,835
And I'm betting
you know who she is.

753
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:13,310
Gally...

754
01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:18,952
you know we can't stay
here forever, right?

755
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,470
Who's there?

756
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:42,750
It's just me.

757
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:44,869
Sorry, Chuck.

758
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:46,315
Here.

759
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:48,671
You'll run better
on a full stomach.

760
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:02,635
Thanks, Chuck.

761
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:09,513
Hey, what do you got there?

762
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,240
Wow, that came out
pretty damn good.

763
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:19,755
What's that for?

764
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,192
It's for my parents.

765
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:25,951
You remember your parents?

766
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:28,194
No.

767
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,192
I mean, I know I must have them.

768
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,237
And wherever they are,
I'm sure they miss me...

769
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:38,753
but I can't miss them because
I don't remember them.

770
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:47,598
What do you think you're gonna
find out there tomorrow?

771
01:03:50,040 --> 01:03:51,440
Uh, I don't know.

772
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,394
But if there's a way out, Chuck,

773
01:03:55,480 --> 01:03:57,278
me and Minho are gonna find it.

774
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:04,790
Here.

775
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,638
Chuck, why would
you give this to me?

776
01:04:15,280 --> 01:04:17,112
I can't remember them anyway.

777
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,440
But maybe if you find a way out,

778
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,159
you can give it to them for me.

779
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:26,599
I'll let you get some sleep.

780
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:37,515
Hey, Chuck.

781
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:39,310
Come here.

782
01:04:43,840 --> 01:04:45,354
Put out your hand.

783
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,671
I want you to give
that to them yourself.

784
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,154
We're gonna get out of here.

785
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,670
All of us.

786
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,996
Okay?

787
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:59,160
I promise.

788
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:02,994
Yeah. All right.

789
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:06,711
Good night. Good night, buddy.

790
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,680
Big day, Greenie.

791
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,319
Are you sure you don't
wanna sit this one out?

792
01:05:26,080 --> 01:05:28,549
- Come on, man. Get me out of here.
- All right.

793
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:48,150
Let's go!

794
01:06:00,120 --> 01:06:02,077
This way. Not much further
to the inner ring.

795
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:03,560
Let's go!

796
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:07,990
Come on! This way.

797
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,959
That's strange.

798
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:37,070
What?

799
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,436
Seven is not supposed to
be open for another week.

800
01:06:46,840 --> 01:06:49,594
What the hell is this place?

801
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,353
We call them blades.

802
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,357
It's Ben's, isn't it?

803
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:13,920
Yeah.

804
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:17,311
A Griever must have
pulled him down here.

805
01:07:24,320 --> 01:07:25,640
Hey!

806
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:49,552
I think it's showing us the way.

807
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,756
- Wait, wait, wait.
- What, what?

808
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:02,918
This way. Come on.

809
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:29,234
Minho, you ever see
this place before?

810
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,040
No.

811
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,597
It's just another dead end.

812
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:24,679
Are you sure about this?

813
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,475
Nope.

814
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:04,994
Grievers.

815
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,480
What the hell was that?

816
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,993
We gotta get out of here.

817
01:10:26,160 --> 01:10:27,992
Give me the key, give me the key!

818
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:34,915
Move, move!

819
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,359
We gotta go! Run, Thomas!

820
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:45,159
We're gonna get trapped!

821
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:46,515
Go! Go!

822
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:52,150
Go, go, go!

823
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:53,310
Move!

824
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:04,350
Minho!

825
01:11:04,560 --> 01:11:06,040
Come on! Let's go, let's go!

826
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:11,990
Come on, move!

827
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,152
Keep going! Keep going! Let's go!

828
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:17,554
Go, go, go!

829
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:24,030
Oh!

830
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:33,956
Go, go, go!

831
01:11:41,880 --> 01:11:43,553
Come on! Don't look back!

832
01:11:48,440 --> 01:11:49,669
Come on!

833
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:53,913
Oh, shit!

834
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,590
There!

835
01:12:12,600 --> 01:12:13,590
Oh!

836
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:18,634
What the hell's
going on out there?

837
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:20,069
What the hell you
done now, Thomas?

838
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:21,720
We found something, a new passage.

839
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:22,995
We think it could be a way out.

840
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,913
- Really?
- It's true.

841
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,515
We opened a door, something
I'd never seen before.

842
01:12:27,680 --> 01:12:29,273
I think it must be where the
Grievers go during the day.

843
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:30,630
Wait!

844
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,951
You're saying you found
the Grievers' home?

845
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:34,315
And you want us to go in?

846
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,960
Their way in could
be our way out, Chuck.

847
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,476
Yeah, or there could be a dozen
Grievers on the other side.

848
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,838
The truth is, Thomas doesn't
know what he has done, as usual.

849
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,719
Yeah, at least I did
something, Gally.

850
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,950
I mean, what have you done?

851
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,152
Aside from hide behind
these walls all the time?

852
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:48,595
Let me tell you
something, Greenie.

853
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,355
You've been here 3 days, all right?
I've been here 3 years!

854
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:53,671
Yeah, you've been here 3 years
and you're still here, Gally!

855
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:54,950
What does that tell you?

856
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,600
Maybe you should start doing
things a little differently.

857
01:12:56,680 --> 01:12:58,831
Maybe you should be in
charge, what about that?

858
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:00,832
Hey, it's Alby!

859
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:03,312
He's awake.

860
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,675
Has he said anything?

861
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:06,990
No.

862
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:10,154
Alby...

863
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:15,393
Alby, are you all right?

864
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:23,757
Hey, Alby.

865
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:29,160
Alby, we might have just
found a way out of the maze.

866
01:13:30,200 --> 01:13:33,113
Do you hear me? We could
be getting out of here.

867
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,072
We can't.

868
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:40,479
We can't leave.

869
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,712
They won't let us.

870
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,280
What are you talking about?

871
01:13:46,280 --> 01:13:47,555
I remember.

872
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:53,631
What do you remember?

873
01:13:55,320 --> 01:13:56,800
You.

874
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,277
You were always
their favorite, Thomas.

875
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:05,315
Always.

876
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:10,760
Why did you do this?

877
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,310
Why did you come here?

878
01:14:24,920 --> 01:14:25,910
Winston, what's going on?

879
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:28,151
It's the doors.
They aren't closing.

880
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,510
Chuck, go to the Council Hall

881
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,233
and start barricading the doors.

882
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,119
Winston, you go with him. Got it.

883
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,710
Get the others. Tell them to go
to the forest. Go hide, now!

884
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,277
Minho, I want you to grab
every weapon you can find.

885
01:15:32,440 --> 01:15:34,557
- I'll meet you at Council Hall.
- Let's go.

886
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:39,240
Teresa, you and I are gonna go
get Alby, all right? Come on.

887
01:15:46,520 --> 01:15:48,557
All right, everybody hide!

888
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:49,950
Teresa!

889
01:15:50,120 --> 01:15:53,113
Come on! Run! Run!

890
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,390
Stay down!

891
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:03,870
Run!

892
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,194
Zart!

893
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:26,318
- Help me!
- Go! Get to the village!

894
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:34,799
Go, go, go!

895
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:42,959
Stay down, stay down!

896
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:45,915
Gally! Let me in, let me in!

897
01:16:52,720 --> 01:16:54,393
- Alby!
- Are you okay?

898
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,550
What's going on?

899
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:58,277
- They're here.
- Grievers?

900
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:06,200
Thomas, what do we do?

901
01:17:06,360 --> 01:17:08,750
It's got me!

902
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,840
Everybody, run, run, run!

903
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,400
Jeff, come on, go, go, go!

904
01:17:31,800 --> 01:17:33,951
Everyone, go, go, go!

905
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:53,356
Keep moving! Oh, shit!

906
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,114
Alby!

907
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:57,749
Get behind me!

908
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:02,599
Come on!

909
01:18:05,640 --> 01:18:06,915
Over here, let's go!

910
01:18:07,080 --> 01:18:09,675
Over here! Let's go! Come on!

911
01:18:11,960 --> 01:18:13,189
Over here, come on!

912
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:14,714
Winston!

913
01:18:14,880 --> 01:18:16,030
Get Alby inside.

914
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,559
Chuck, get in! Go, go, go!

915
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,398
Lock down the doors!

916
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:40,353
Careful.

917
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:44,149
Stay back, guys.

918
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:11,590
Is everyone all right?

919
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,433
Help!

920
01:19:14,600 --> 01:19:16,353
Hey, grab him! Help!

921
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:20,589
Watch out!

922
01:19:27,240 --> 01:19:28,230
Chuck!

923
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,553
- Chuck, no!
- Grab him!

924
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:33,790
Pull him back!

925
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,799
- Help!
- Chuck, don't let go!

926
01:19:36,960 --> 01:19:38,553
No shit!

927
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:40,598
- Pull!
- Don't let him go!

928
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:03,240
- Chuck, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

929
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:06,956
Thanks, Alby.

930
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:09,874
Alby! Watch out!

931
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:13,110
Grab him!

932
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,911
Thomas, get them out.

933
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,156
Alby!

934
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:24,915
- No!
- Thomas...

935
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,634
- Thomas!
- Don't go out there!

936
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,836
No, Thomas, wait!

937
01:20:28,200 --> 01:20:29,634
Thomas, wait!

938
01:20:37,960 --> 01:20:39,474
Where is everybody?

939
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,353
Who's that over there?

940
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:50,317
Gally...

941
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:53,840
This is all you, Thomas!
Look around!

942
01:20:54,000 --> 01:20:55,639
Back off, Gally!
It's not Thomas' fault!

943
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:56,716
You heard what Alby said!

944
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:58,029
- He's one of them!
- One of who?

945
01:20:58,240 --> 01:21:00,072
He's one of them,
and they sent him here

946
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:02,032
to destroy everything,
and now he has!

947
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:04,949
Look around, Thomas! Look around!

948
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,150
This is your fault!

949
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:07,993
Back off, Gally!
This is not Thomas' fault!

950
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:10,834
What are you talking about?
Calm down.

951
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:13,710
They sent him here,

952
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:15,075
and now he's destroyed
everything that we've built!

953
01:21:15,160 --> 01:21:16,640
What are you talking about?

954
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:20,313
Maybe he's right.

955
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:22,233
Thomas...

956
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,750
I need to remember, Teresa.

957
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:27,673
Thomas...

958
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:29,877
Thomas! No, don't!

959
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,556
Thomas!

960
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:33,995
Chuck, get the other syringe!

961
01:21:35,040 --> 01:21:36,679
It's okay.

962
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:38,559
Thomas, I'm here.

963
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,670
<i>Who put us here?</i>

964
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:53,715
<i>That we don't know.</i>

965
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:00,230
<i>Teresa...</i>

966
01:22:00,400 --> 01:22:02,119
<i>why are we doing this?</i>

967
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,189
<i>Excellent, Thomas.</i>

968
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:08,396
Come with me.

969
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,952
- Wicked isn't good.
<i>- Thomas...</i>

970
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:13,634
Wicked is good.

971
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:15,956
<i>How could this be my fault?</i>

972
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:17,190
<i>You did this!</i>

973
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:19,040
<i>I saw you!</i>

974
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:23,236
<i>I can't keep watching them die.</i>

975
01:22:29,240 --> 01:22:30,720
Hey.

976
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:33,719
Are you okay?

977
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,913
What the hell were you thinking?

978
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:44,755
What happened?

979
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:46,920
Gally has taken control.

980
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,959
He said we had a choice.
Either join him...

981
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,794
or get banished
at sundown with you.

982
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,430
And the others agreed to that?

983
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:00,119
Gally has everyone convinced that

984
01:23:00,200 --> 01:23:02,317
you're the reason
all this has happened.

985
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,436
Well, he's been right so far.

986
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,593
What are you talking about?

987
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:13,273
This place...

988
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,430
it's not what we thought it was.

989
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,430
It's not a prison, it's a test.

990
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:23,272
It all started when we were kids.

991
01:23:24,360 --> 01:23:27,159
They would give us
these challenges.

992
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:30,315
They were experimenting on us.

993
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:34,512
And then people
started disappearing.

994
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:37,479
Every month, one after the
other, like clockwork.

995
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,712
They were sending
them up into the maze.

996
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:42,556
Yeah, but not all of us.

997
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:44,873
What do you mean?

998
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:49,799
Guys, I'm one of them.

999
01:23:52,320 --> 01:23:54,835
The people who put you
here, I worked with them.

1000
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:59,394
I watched you guys for years.

1001
01:23:59,920 --> 01:24:02,640
The entire time
you have been here...

1002
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,832
I was on the other side of it.

1003
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:08,994
So were you.

1004
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:12,030
What?

1005
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:15,990
Teresa, we did this to them.

1006
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:19,195
No.

1007
01:24:20,520 --> 01:24:22,000
That can't be true.

1008
01:24:22,240 --> 01:24:25,597
It is. I saw it.

1009
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,511
Why would they send us
up if we were with them?

1010
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,673
It doesn't matter.

1011
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,514
He's right.

1012
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,839
It doesn't matter.

1013
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:41,353
Any of it.

1014
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,514
Because the people we were before
the maze don't even exist anymore.

1015
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:48,751
These Creators took care of that.

1016
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:53,590
But what does matter is who
we are now, and what we do...

1017
01:24:53,760 --> 01:24:55,399
right now.

1018
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:59,080
You went into the maze
and you found a way out.

1019
01:24:59,400 --> 01:25:02,552
Yeah, but if I hadn't,
Alby would still be alive.

1020
01:25:05,960 --> 01:25:07,440
Maybe.

1021
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,554
But I know that if he were here,

1022
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:15,917
he would be telling you
the exact same thing.

1023
01:25:17,080 --> 01:25:20,312
Pick your ass up
and finish what you started.

1024
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,755
Because if we do nothing...

1025
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,078
then that means Alby died for
nothing, and I can't have that.

1026
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:33,114
Okay.

1027
01:25:34,920 --> 01:25:38,197
Okay, but we gotta
get through Gally first.

1028
01:26:07,280 --> 01:26:09,192
This is such a waste.

1029
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,155
Gally...

1030
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,957
It doesn't feel right, man.

1031
01:26:24,120 --> 01:26:26,555
Yeah, what if Thomas is right?

1032
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,471
Maybe he can lead us home.

1033
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,672
We are home.

1034
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,959
Okay?

1035
01:26:37,240 --> 01:26:40,199
I don't wanna have to cross
any more names off that wall.

1036
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:41,680
You really think banishing us

1037
01:26:41,760 --> 01:26:44,036
is gonna solve anything?

1038
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:46,160
No.

1039
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,312
But this isn't a banishing.

1040
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:51,316
It's an offering.

1041
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:53,312
What? Wait!

1042
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,437
Gally, what are you doing?

1043
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:57,398
You really think
I'm gonna let Thomas

1044
01:26:57,480 --> 01:26:59,278
back into the maze
after what he has done?

1045
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,713
Look around you!

1046
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:05,116
Look at our Glade!

1047
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,679
This is the only way.

1048
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:13,117
And when the Grievers get
what they came here for...

1049
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:15,837
everything goes back
to the way it was.

1050
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,229
Are you listening to this?

1051
01:27:17,400 --> 01:27:19,869
Why are you all just standing there?
He's crazy!

1052
01:27:19,960 --> 01:27:21,917
- You shut up.
- If you stay here,

1053
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,235
the Grievers are
going to come back.

1054
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,352
They're gonna come back, and
they're gonna keep coming back...

1055
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:26,670
until you're all dead!

1056
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,672
Shut up! Tie him up!

1057
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,352
Do you hear me? I said tie him up!

1058
01:27:57,400 --> 01:27:58,993
You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

1059
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:02,393
You don't have to come with
us, but we are leaving.

1060
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:04,836
Anyone else who wants to come,
now is your last chance.

1061
01:28:05,040 --> 01:28:06,554
Don't listen to him, he's
just trying to scare you.

1062
01:28:06,720 --> 01:28:09,110
No, I'm not trying to scare you.
You're already scared.

1063
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,233
I'm scared.

1064
01:28:13,880 --> 01:28:15,155
But I'd rather risk
my life out there

1065
01:28:15,240 --> 01:28:16,913
than spending the rest
of it in here.

1066
01:28:19,280 --> 01:28:21,272
We don't belong here.

1067
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:24,640
This place isn't our home.

1068
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,233
We were put here.

1069
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:29,199
We were trapped here.

1070
01:28:30,920 --> 01:28:33,196
At least, out there
we have a choice.

1071
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,471
We can make it out of here.

1072
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,756
I know that.

1073
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,634
I'm sorry.

1074
01:29:08,400 --> 01:29:10,790
Gally, it's over.

1075
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:15,949
Just come with us.

1076
01:29:23,640 --> 01:29:25,916
Good luck against the Grievers.

1077
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,194
Everybody, this way!

1078
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,232
Keep it up, guys,
we're almost there!

1079
01:30:16,560 --> 01:30:19,234
- Is it a Griever?
- Yeah.

1080
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:21,475
Shit.

1081
01:30:21,920 --> 01:30:24,389
You take this, Chuck.
Stay behind us.

1082
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:29,075
It's okay. Just stick with me.

1083
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:31,674
Once we're through,
it will activate

1084
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:33,035
and the door will open.

1085
01:30:33,200 --> 01:30:35,317
We stay close,
we stick together...

1086
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,751
we get through this.
We get out now...

1087
01:30:37,920 --> 01:30:39,991
or we die trying.

1088
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:42,070
Ready?

1089
01:30:43,560 --> 01:30:45,552
All right. Let's go!

1090
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:02,554
Get up, look out!

1091
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:06,550
Push it!

1092
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:13,070
Look out!

1093
01:31:22,160 --> 01:31:23,355
The key!

1094
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,751
Chuck! Watch the edge!

1095
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:33,636
Oh, no.

1096
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:37,032
- I got you, Chuck!
- Pull me up!

1097
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:48,876
Come on!

1098
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:51,796
Thomas! Thomas!

1099
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,350
Chuck?

1100
01:31:53,560 --> 01:31:54,880
We got more coming!

1101
01:31:56,480 --> 01:31:58,472
Keep it steady, guys!

1102
01:32:00,720 --> 01:32:01,790
It works!

1103
01:32:03,080 --> 01:32:04,958
Teresa, go!

1104
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,150
Don't back down! Keep pushing!
Stay together!

1105
01:32:16,120 --> 01:32:17,634
There's gotta be
a way out! Come on!

1106
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,310
Watch it!

1107
01:32:31,680 --> 01:32:33,672
It won't open!

1108
01:32:36,960 --> 01:32:39,270
Thomas! There's a code!

1109
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:40,516
Eight numbers!

1110
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:44,314
Eight sections of the maze.

1111
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:47,433
- Hey, Minho! What's the sequence?
- What?

1112
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,352
The sections of the maze,
what's the sequence?

1113
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,199
Seven! One!

1114
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:54,353
Five! Two!

1115
01:32:54,520 --> 01:32:56,352
Six! Four! Heads up!

1116
01:32:59,040 --> 01:33:00,110
Minho!

1117
01:33:00,200 --> 01:33:01,190
Minho! Oh!

1118
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:04,954
Get off of me!

1119
01:33:14,720 --> 01:33:15,995
Jeff!

1120
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,949
What's the sequence? Come on!

1121
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:22,835
Six! Four! Eight!

1122
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,559
Three! You got it?

1123
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,720
Keep holding!

1124
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,116
Almost there, come on!

1125
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,310
The door opened!

1126
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:40,234
Oh!

1127
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,674
Seriously?

1128
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:44,874
What happened here?

1129
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:20,712
So they were watching us.

1130
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:23,559
This whole time.

1131
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:50,760
<i>Hello.</i>

1132
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,071
<i>My name is Doctor Ava Paige.</i>

1133
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,994
<i>I'm Director of Operations</i>

1134
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:58,471
<i>of the World Catastrophe
Killzone Department.</i>

1135
01:36:58,640 --> 01:37:00,040
<i>If you're watching this,
that means</i>

1136
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:03,113
<i>you have successfully
completed the Maze Trials.</i>

1137
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:06,718
<i>I wish I could be there in
person to congratulate you...</i>

1138
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:12,275
<i>but circumstances seem
to have prevented it.</i>

1139
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,955
<i>I'm sure by now, you must
all be very confused...</i>

1140
01:37:15,800 --> 01:37:16,836
<i>angry...</i>

1141
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:18,480
<i>frightened.</i>

1142
01:37:18,640 --> 01:37:21,792
<i>I can only assure you, that
everything that's happened to you...</i>

1143
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,235
<i>everything we've done to you...</i>

1144
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,437
<i>it was all done for a reason.</i>

1145
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:29,839
<i>You won't remember...</i>

1146
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:32,754
<i>but the Sun has
scorched our world.</i>

1147
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,069
<i>Billions of lives lost to fire...</i>

1148
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:38,950
<i>famine...</i>

1149
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:42,439
<i>suffering on a global scale.</i>

1150
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:45,593
<i>The fallout was unimaginable.</i>

1151
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,000
<i>What came after was worse.</i>

1152
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:51,314
<i>We called it the Flare.</i>

1153
01:37:52,480 --> 01:37:55,917
<i>A deadly virus that
attacks the brain.</i>

1154
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,912
<i>It is violent...</i>

1155
01:37:58,080 --> 01:37:59,594
<i>unpredictable...</i>

1156
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,318
<i>incurable.</i>

1157
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:05,159
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

1158
01:38:06,840 --> 01:38:09,196
<i>In time, a new generation emerged</i>

1159
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,078
<i>that could survive the virus.</i>

1160
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:14,756
<i>Suddenly, there was a
reason to hope for a cure.</i>

1161
01:38:16,120 --> 01:38:18,680
<i>But finding it would not be easy.</i>

1162
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:21,958
<i>The young would have to be
tested, even sacrificed...</i>

1163
01:38:22,320 --> 01:38:24,471
<i>inside harsh environments...</i>

1164
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,677
<i>where their brain activity
could be studied.</i>

1165
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,159
<i>All in an effort to understand...</i>

1166
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:31,471
<i>what makes them different...</i>

1167
01:38:32,680 --> 01:38:35,514
<i>what makes you different.</i>

1168
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:38,797
<i>You may not realize it...</i>

1169
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,316
<i>but you're very important.</i>

1170
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:44,514
<i>Unfortunately, your trials
have only just begun.</i>

1171
01:38:44,720 --> 01:38:46,712
<i>As you will no doubt
soon discover,</i>

1172
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:48,871
<i>not everyone agrees
with our methods.</i>

1173
01:38:49,040 --> 01:38:52,192
<i>Progress is slow,
people are scared.</i>

1174
01:38:52,360 --> 01:38:54,955
<i>It may be too late for us...</i>

1175
01:38:55,040 --> 01:38:56,872
<i>for me...</i>

1176
01:38:57,040 --> 01:38:58,394
<i>but not for you.</i>

1177
01:38:59,320 --> 01:39:01,118
<i>The outside world awaits.</i>

1178
01:39:01,720 --> 01:39:03,120
<i>Remember...</i>

1179
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,994
<i>Wicked is good.</i>

1180
01:39:43,760 --> 01:39:45,274
Is it over?

1181
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,037
She said we were important.

1182
01:39:50,760 --> 01:39:52,717
What are we supposed to do now?

1183
01:40:01,360 --> 01:40:02,953
I don't know.

1184
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,113
Let's get out of here.

1185
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:13,790
No.

1186
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:20,119
- Gally?
- Don't.

1187
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:23,038
He's been stung.

1188
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:31,960
We can't leave.

1189
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:37,991
We did. Gally, we're out.

1190
01:40:39,120 --> 01:40:40,395
We're free.

1191
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:43,915
Free?

1192
01:40:47,400 --> 01:40:49,392
You think we're free out there?

1193
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:51,830
No.

1194
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:56,276
No, there's no escape
from this place.

1195
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:02,914
Gally, listen to me.

1196
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:05,356
You're not thinking straight.

1197
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:07,110
You're not.

1198
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,992
Now, we can help you.

1199
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,512
Just put down the gun.

1200
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:16,039
I belong to the maze.

1201
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:17,919
Just put down the gun.

1202
01:41:21,000 --> 01:41:22,354
We all do.

1203
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,520
Thomas...

1204
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,800
Chuck.

1205
01:41:52,480 --> 01:41:54,312
Oh, shit. Shit.

1206
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:56,720
Look at me, look at me!

1207
01:41:58,080 --> 01:41:59,070
Oh, shit!

1208
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:00,720
Chuck, look at me, all right?

1209
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:02,394
I got you, buddy. Just hang on.

1210
01:42:03,000 --> 01:42:04,400
It's okay.

1211
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,234
Thomas, Thomas...

1212
01:42:11,720 --> 01:42:13,712
No, Chuck. You're gonna
give it to them yourself.

1213
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:14,870
Remember, I told you that.

1214
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:16,229
Take it.

1215
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:18,036
No.

1216
01:42:20,600 --> 01:42:21,590
Thank you.

1217
01:42:25,600 --> 01:42:26,750
Thank you.

1218
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:28,196
No, Chuck, you're gonna get...

1219
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:33,910
Chuck.

1220
01:42:36,680 --> 01:42:38,273
Chuck? Hey.

1221
01:42:40,200 --> 01:42:41,919
Hey, Chuck, come on!

1222
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:44,473
Come on, wake up!

1223
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:53,270
Damn it!

1224
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:58,152
We made it. Come on.

1225
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:04,873
I'm sorry!

1226
01:43:06,120 --> 01:43:07,440
God damn it!

1227
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:10,792
Damn it!

1228
01:43:16,880 --> 01:43:17,950
- Thomas.
- Chuck!

1229
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:23,876
Get up, Chuck! Come on!

1230
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,110
Chuck!

1231
01:43:39,720 --> 01:43:41,632
You can't just leave him there!

1232
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:20,709
You guys all right?

1233
01:44:21,440 --> 01:44:22,590
Don't worry.

1234
01:44:22,760 --> 01:44:24,114
You're safe now.

1235
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,279
Relax, kid.

1236
01:45:03,680 --> 01:45:05,990
Everything is gonna change.

1237
01:45:20,840 --> 01:45:24,117
I think it's safe to say the Maze
Trials were a complete success.

1238
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,156
<i>I wasn't expecting
so many survivors, but...</i>

1239
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:30,429
<i>the more the merrier.</i>

1240
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:38,596
<i>Thomas continues to
surprise and impress.</i>

1241
01:45:39,960 --> 01:45:43,715
<i>And for now, they seem
to have taken the bait.</i>

1242
01:45:44,840 --> 01:45:46,752
<i>It's too soon to say...</i>

1243
01:45:48,440 --> 01:45:50,591
<i>but they could be
the key to everything.</i>

1244
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:54,794
<i>So let's move forward.</i>

1245
01:45:56,560 --> 01:45:59,632
It's time now to begin Phase Two.
