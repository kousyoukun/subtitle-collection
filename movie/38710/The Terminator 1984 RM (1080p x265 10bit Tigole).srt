00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:05,910
這些命案 是依電話簿裡的次序發生的?
These killings occurred in the order of their listings in the phone book.

135
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,370
-我可以說什麼?  無可奉告  -但是...

-派組人去  -已經派了  還沒回音
-Send a unit.  -I sent a unit. There's no answer.

140

142

給我一支香煙

143
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:56,370

Hi, there. Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.

But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need love, too, so talk to it...

145
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,670
金珍  是我啦...

147
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,420
又是一樣
Same shit.

148
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:13,180
我現在聽到了 就叫他"電話簿殺手"吧
I can hear it now. He's gonna be called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.

149
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:18,510
我討厭這些觸目案件  特別是變態的案件
I hate these press cases. Especially the weird press cases.

150
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,690

-Where are you going?  -To make a statement.

151
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,860
叫這班走狗替我們工作
Maybe make these jackals work for us.

152
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:29,780
若我11點前能上電視  或許她會找我們的
If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock, maybe she'll call us.

153
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,530
怎樣?  我的樣子怎樣?
Well, how do I look?

154
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:35,990
-很難看  老總  -不錯
-Like shit, boss.  -Your mama.

155

in the second of two murders which took place today.

157
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,460
奇怪的是  兩名死者都是同名同姓
Incredibly, the names of the two victims are virtually identical.

158

163
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:04,350
兩宗案件的類同之處

Sweat, bad breath, everything. Very hard to spot.

236

I had to wait till he moved on you before I could zero him.

237

Look, I am not stupid. They cannot make things like that yet.

你是說它來自未來?

那麼你也是來自未來?

它不會同情或後悔...或者恐懼
It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear

and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.

250
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:20,100

它為何要對付我?

259
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:54,360
未來數年後
A few years from now,

260
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:02,120
這裡的一切...這個地方  所有的東西
all this, this whole place, everything,

261
00:45:02,250 --> 00:45:06,830
都會消失  就此消失
it's gone, just gone.

262
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:09,670
有一些生還者
There were survivors.

263
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:11,840
零星...散落各地
Here, there.

264
00:45:14,510 --> 00:45:17,600
沒有人知道是誰發動戰爭
Nobody even knew who started it.

265
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:24,560
-是那些機器  -我不明白
-It was the machines, Sarah.  -I don't understand.

266
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,230
防衛網路電腦
Defence network computers.

267
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:31,070
新型的  功能強勁
New, powerful,

268
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,980
接駁到所有東西  被委託操控一切重任
hooked into everything, trusted to run it all.

269
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:41,660
他們說它變得聰明起來  一種智慧的新秩序
They say it got smart, a new order of intelligence.

270
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,490
它視所有人類為威脅
Then it saw all people as a threat.

271
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,490
不能與我們共存
Not just the ones on the other side.

272
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,500
它在刹那間決定了我們的命運
It decided our fate in a microsecond.

273
00:45:53,010 --> 00:45:55,050
滅絕
Extermination.

274
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:11,470
你可有目睹這場戰爭?
Did you see this war?

275
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:28,030
沒有  我在戰後長大  在廢墟中成長
No. I grew up after. In the ruins.

276
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:31,250
挨饑抵餓  躲避那些HK
Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.

277
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:34,250
-HK?  -追捕殺手
-H-Ks?  -Hunter killers.

278
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:38,290
機械工廠製造的巡邏機器
Patrol machines built in automated factories.

279
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:43,050
我們大部分人被圍捕  關在營裡等候被消滅
Most of us were rounded up. Put in camps for orderly disposal.

280
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,050
這是被鐳射素描器烙下的
This was burned in by laser scanner.

281
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:55,060
我們有部分人得以活下來  去幹活
Some of us were kept alive. To work.

282
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:58,810
搬運屍體
Loading bodies.

283
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,610
那些消滅單位日以繼夜的運作
The disposal units ran night and day.

284
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:04,820
我們差點就喪命
We were that close to going out for ever.

285
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:11,580
但有一個人...教我們反抗
But there was one man who taught us to fight.

286
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:13,750
衝擊監禁營的線路
To storm the wire of the camps.

287
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:17,460
把那些金屬混蛋撞個稀巴爛
To smash those metal mother fuckers into junk.

288
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,710
他扭轉了局勢  帶我們脫離險境
He turned it around. He brought us back from the brink.

289
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:26,170
他姓康納  約翰·康納
His name was Connor. John Connor.

290
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:30,930
你的兒子  你未出世的兒子
Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.

291
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,450
你來開車
Drive.

292
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:31,460
李斯
Reese!

293
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,100
不  李斯  不不  他們會殺死你的
No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.

294
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:57,020
在卡迪拉克房車裡的人  立刻舉高雙手
You in the Cadillac, let me see your hands now.

295
00:49:59,490 --> 00:50:01,950
下車
Get out of the car.

296
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:06,450
跪下
Drop to your knees.

297
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,870
-下車  -跪下
-Out of the car.  -Drop to the ground.

298
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:42,560
薩拉...喝一點吧
Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.

299
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,360
你肯定是他們?
Listen, are you sure it's them?

300
00:50:47,490 --> 00:50:50,490
我應該看看屍體的
I mean, maybe I should look at the bodies.

301
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:54,830
已經證實了他們的身分  沒錯的
No. They've been identified and there's no doubt.

302
00:50:57,420 --> 00:51:02,000
金珍  小夥子
Ginger. Kiddo.

303
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:07,750
-薩拉  這是索博曼醫生  -你好  薩拉
-Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.  -Hi, Sarah.

304
00:51:07,890 --> 00:51:11,930
告訴他李斯對你說的一切  你應付得來嗎
Tell him everything Reese told you, Sarah. Do you feel up to that?

305
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,100
可以吧
Yeah, I guess so.

306
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:19,890
-你是個醫生?  -犯罪學心理醫生
-You're a doctor?  -Criminal psychologist.

307
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:24,820
-李斯是不是瘋的?  -這就是我們要查證的
-Is Reese crazy?  -That's what we're gonna find out.

308
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,020
你是個軍人吧  保衛著誰?
So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?

309
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:59,740
隸屬貝裡率領的第132團  從21年到27年
With the 132nd under Perry. From '21 to '27.

310
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:02,660
那是...2027年?
That's the year 2027?

311
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,830
對  後來我被派到...
That's right. Then I was assigned...

312
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:08,740
-很好  -當約翰·康納的部下
-This is fucking great.  -under John Connor.

313
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,960
-敵人是誰?  -一個電腦防衛系統...
-Who was the enemy?  -A computer defence system...

314
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,380
該死  對不起
Goddamn! Sorry.

315
00:53:14,510 --> 00:53:18,010
電腦動力系統替薩諾力製造的
built for SAC-NORAD by Cyberdyne Systems.

316
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:20,180
是吧
I see.

317
00:53:20,310 --> 00:53:23,090
這個電腦認為
And this computer thinks .

318
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,090
殺了敵人的母親  就能勝利
it can win by killing the mother of its enemy

319
00:53:26,230 --> 00:53:29,510
把他在孕育前就殺掉
Killing him, in effect, before he's even conceived.

320
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:31,890
算是倒逆的墮胎?
A sort of retroactive abortion?

321
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,900
索博曼笑死我了  那傢伙把他弄得一頭霧水
Silberman cracks me up. Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.

322
00:53:37,030 --> 00:53:39,110
-他先弄得一團糟  -閉嘴
-He screwed it first...  -Ed, shut up.

323
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,260
那麼為何它...不殺死康納約翰?
Why didn't the computer just kill Connor then?

324
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:44,930
為何要有這個毀滅者的計畫?
Why this elaborate scheme with the Terminator?

325
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:49,520
我沒有選擇  它們的防禦網路被催毀
It had no choice. Their defence grid was smashed.

326
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:54,020
我們贏了  殺掉康納約翰也不會有何分別
We'd won. Taking out Connor then would make no difference.

327
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:57,070
天網要剷除他整個組織
Skynet had to wipe out his entire existence.

328
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:58,990
是不是當你們操控實驗室 找到...
Is that when you captured the lab complex and found...

329
00:53:58,990 --> 00:54:01,990
那個什麼?
What is it called?

330
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:04,570
時空轉移裝置?
The time displacement equipment?

331
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,530
不錯  那個毀滅者已經穿越過來了
That's right. The Terminator had already gone through.

332
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:11,700
康納派我來攔截  它們炸毀了整個地方
Connor sent me to intercept and they blew the whole place.

333
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:14,500
那你怎麼回去?
Well, how are you supposed to get back?

334
00:54:14,630 --> 00:54:16,670
我回不去了
I can't.

335
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:22,920
沒人能回家  也沒人能過來
Nobody goes home. Nobody else comes through.

336
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:27,590
只有他...和我
It's just him and me.

337
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:14,530
只有他...和我
It's just him and me.

338
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:22,700
為何你沒帶武器?  一些更先進的武器?
Why didn't you bring any weapons? Something more advanced.

339
00:56:22,830 --> 00:56:25,700
你們沒有鐳射槍的嗎?
Don't you have ray guns?

340
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:29,370
-鐳射槍  -給我看看一件未來的科技
-Ray guns.  -Show me a piece of future technology.

341
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,170
你要光著身體
You go naked. .

342
00:56:31,170 --> 00:56:34,170
它跟由生物產生的磁場有關
Something about the field generated by a living organism

343
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:38,000
死物是不行的  那鬼東西不是我製造的
Nothing dead will go. I didn't build the fucking thing.

344
00:56:38,140 --> 00:56:42,630
好的...但這個電子人  若它是金屬的...
OK, OK. But this cyborg, if it's metal...?

345
00:56:42,770 --> 00:56:46,270
-被活組織包著的  -對  是的
-Surrounded by living tissue.  -Oh, right.

346
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,230
好東西  我能因他功成名就
This is great stuff. I could make a career out of this guy.

347
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,310
看這個多聰明?  不需要證據
You see how clever this part is? It doesn't require a shred of proof.

348
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:57,070
大部分妄想狂都很複雜  但這個卻很精明
Most paranoid delusions are intricate, but this is brilliant.

349
00:56:58,070 --> 00:57:01,910
-為何另外兩女會被殺  -大部分記錄都在戰爭中遺失
-Why were the other women killed?  -Records were lost in the war.

350
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:04,700
天網對康納的母親幾乎一無所知
Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's mother.

351
00:57:04,830 --> 00:57:08,530
不知道她的全名和地址  只知道在哪個城市
Her full name, where she lived. They just knew the city.

352
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,540
那個毀滅者只是受系統操控
The Terminator was just being systematic.

353
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:14,460
-我們再談談...  -你聽得夠多了
-Let's go back...  -Look, you have heard enough.

354
00:57:14,590 --> 00:57:17,920
我已經回答了你的問題  現在我要見薩拉
I have answered your questions. I have to see Sarah Connor.

355
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:21,880
-我作不了主  -那為何我要跟你談?
-I'm afraid that's not up to me.  -Then why am I talking to you?

356
00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:24,050
-誰是主管?  -求你...
-Who is in authority here?  -Please...

357
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:26,220
閉嘴
Shut up!

358
00:57:26,350 --> 00:57:29,020
你還是不明白  對不對?
You still don't get it, do you?

359
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:34,390
他會找到她  這就是他要做的  他只會這樣做
He'll find her. That's what he does. That's all he does.

360
00:57:34,520 --> 00:57:35,900
你阻止不了他
You can't stop him.

361
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:40,110
他會掐住她喉嚨 挖出她心臟
He'll reach down her throat and pull her fucking heart out!

362
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:42,730
-醫生  -放開我
-Doc.  -Let go of me!

363
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,080
對不起
Sorry.

364
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,500
他是瘋子?
He's crazy?

365
00:57:54,630 --> 00:57:58,040
用技術性的用語...他是個傻子
In technical terminology, he's a loon.

366
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:04,130
這是他們所謂的盔甲  我們的特種步隊都穿著這個
Sarah, this is what they call body armour. Our TAC guys wear these.

367
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:06,500
擋到12口徑的火力
It'll stop a 12-gauge round.

368
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:10,890
那個人一定是穿了它  觸摸一下吧
This other man must've been wearing one under his coat. Feel that.

369
00:58:12,770 --> 00:58:16,680
-打碎擋風玻璃又怎麼說?  -他可能服了麻醉藥
-What about he punched through the windshield. -He was probably on PCP.

370
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:19,520
就算斷了骨頭  他也感覺不到
Broke every bone in his hand. He wouldn't feel it.

371
00:58:19,650 --> 00:58:22,110
-這個傢伙...看見疤痕嗎?  -拿著
-There was this guy once...You see this scar?  -Here.

372
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,280
謝謝
Thank you.

373
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:27,990
這裡有一張沙發  躺下睡會吧
There's a couch in this other room. Stretch out and get some sleep.

374
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,650
你媽至少要一小時後  才能到這
Be at least an hour before your mother gets here.

375
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,950
-我睡不著  -試試吧
-I can't sleep.  -Try.

376
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:38,210
那張沙發其貌不揚  但很舒服的
It may not look it, but that couch is very comfortable.

377
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:43,670
你會絕對安全的  這座大廈裡有30個警員
You'll be perfectly safe. We got 30 cops in this building.

378
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,800
謝謝你
Thank you.

379
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:54,640
-晚安  -晚安
-Good night.  -Good night.

380
00:59:09,110 --> 00:59:10,780
我是薩拉·康納的朋友
I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.

381
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,780
聽說她在這  我能見她嗎
I was told she's here. Could I see her?

382
00:59:12,910 --> 00:59:15,450
不能  你不能見她 她在錄口供
No. Can't see her. She's making a statement.

383
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,200
她在哪裡?
Where is she?

384
00:59:17,330 --> 00:59:18,080
要一會的
It make take a while.

385
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:22,080
你想等的話  那邊有張長椅
If you wanna wait, there's a bench over there.

386
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:33,630
我會回來
I'll be back.

387
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,180

-自動式武器 -快點  走吧
- Automatic weapons!  -Lock and load! Let's go!

396
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:04,570

406
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:03,770
我們把這個推離公路
All right. Let's get this off the road.

407
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:37,960
-你冷嗎?  -凍僵了
-You cold?  -Freezing.

408
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:53,810

我剛才吃了一記
I caught one back there.

415
01:05:23,130 --> 01:05:25,970
-你中槍了?  -不是很嚴重
-You mean you got shot?  -It's not bad.

416
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:30,510
-我們要找醫生  -沒事的  算了吧
-We gotta get you to a doctor.  -It's OK. Forget it.

417
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:35,550
算了?  你瘋的嗎?  脫下它
What do you mean, forget it? Are you crazy? Take this off.

418
01:05:47,530 --> 01:05:49,360
天
Jesus.

419
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:52,070
它穿過了皮肉
See? It passed right through the meat.

420
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,610
這會使我作嘔
This is gonna make me puke.

421
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:57,910
-你跟我談話好嗎?  -談什麼?
-Would you just talk about something?  -What?

422
01:05:58,040 --> 01:06:02,590
不知道  隨便說吧  談談我的兒子
I don't know. Anything. Just talk. Tell me about my son.

423
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:05,460
他有我這麼高大
He's about my height.

424
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,920
他有你的眼睛
He has your eyes.

425
01:06:14,020 --> 01:06:16,060
他是怎樣的?
What's he like?

426
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,890
你信任他  他有一種力量
You trust him. He's got a strength.

427
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,690
我願意為約翰·康納犧牲
I'd die for John Connor.

428
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:29,230
我現在至少知道給他取什麼名字
Well, at least now I know what to name him.

429
01:06:31,240 --> 01:06:32,990
你不知道他父親是誰吧
Don't suppose you know who the father is

430
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,990
好讓我遇上他時不會叫他滾開
so I won't tell him to get lost?

431
01:06:36,120 --> 01:06:38,990
約翰從來沒有提起他
John never said much about him.

432
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:42,210
-我知道他在戰前死了  -等一會
-I know he dies before the war...  -Wait.

433
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:46,340
我不想知道
I don't wanna know.

434
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:49,880
是不是約翰派你來的?
So was it John that sent you here?

435
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,680
是我自願的
I volunteered.

436
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:57,630
-為什麼?  -有機會認識傳奇人物
-Why?  -It was a chance to meet the legend.

437
01:06:57,770 --> 01:07:04,600
薩拉·康納  教她兒子去抵抗...組織
Sarah Connor, who taught her son to fight, organise,

438
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,890
準備  從他小時就這樣教導他
prepare from when he was a kid.

439
01:07:07,020 --> 01:07:10,730
當其他人還在戰前躲避時
When you were in hiding before the war.

440
01:07:13,160 --> 01:07:16,610
你用過去式說一些 我還沒做的事
You're talking about things I haven't done yet in the past tense.

441
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:19,280
真的令我發瘋
It's driving me crazy.

442
01:07:22,580 --> 01:07:25,040
你肯定沒找錯人?
Are you sure you have the right person?

443
01:07:25,170 --> 01:07:27,330
肯定
I'm sure.

444
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:31,370
不是吧  我像未來的母親?
Come on! Do I look like the mother of the future?

445
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:38,130
我堅強又有組織能力嗎?  我連平衡收支都不會
I mean, am I tough? Organised? I can't even balance my checkbook.

446
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:45,180
我沒有要求這個榮譽  也不想要它
Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this honour and I don't want it.

447
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:47,640
絕對不要
Any of it.

448
01:07:49,810 --> 01:07:54,940
你兒子有個口信給你  他要我背熟它
Your son gave me a message to give to you. Made me memorise it.

449
01:07:55,070 --> 01:07:58,150
"感謝你在黑暗年代的勇氣"
Thank you, Sarah, for your courage through the dark years.

450
01:07:58,280 --> 01:08:02,940
"你要面對的事我幫不到你  未來還未定案"
I can't help you with what you must soon face. The future is not set.

451
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,620
"你一定要比你想像中更堅強"
You must be stronger than you imagine you can be.

452
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:09,080
"你一定要活下去  否則我永不會存在"
You must survive or I will never exist.

453
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:11,250
就是這樣
That's all.

454
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:16,870
包紮得很好
It's a good field dressing.

455
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:19,050
你喜歡嗎?
You like it?

456
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:21,420
這是我的第一次
It's my first.

457
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,640
睡一會吧  快天亮了
Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.

458
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,680
好的
OK.

459
01:08:43,530 --> 01:08:45,770
再跟我談一會
Talk to me some more.

460
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,190
談什麼?
About what?

461
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:54,000
告訴我你從哪裡來
Tell me about where you're from.

462
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,040
好的
All right.

463
01:08:59,420 --> 01:09:03,960
你白天躲起來  但晚上你可以到處活動
You stay down by day, but at night you can move around.

464
01:09:04,090 --> 01:09:09,250
你仍然要小心  因為HK會用紅外線
You still have to be careful because the H-Ks use infrared.

465
01:09:09,970 --> 01:09:15,560
但它們還不夠聰明  約翰教了對付它們的方法
But they're not too bright. John taught us ways to dust them.

466
01:09:16,440 --> 01:09:19,110
就是當那些滲透者出現的時候
That's when the infiltrators started to appear.

467
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:22,930
毀滅者是最新型的...最難對付的
The Terminators were the newest. The worst.

468
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,660

470
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,500

-李斯  DN384...  -對  讓他進來
-Reese. DN384...  -Right. Let him in.

01:10:40,390 --> 01:10:44,560
我們的監察者有一隻爪壞了 所以要減少巡邏
We're cutting short the patrol. Over

473

Roger, Yankee-1-7.You are clear to return.

474

475
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:26,750
我夢見一些狗
I was dreaming about dogs.

476
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:29,970
我們用它們來發現毀滅者
We use 'em to spot Terminators.

477
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,970
你的世界很可怕
Your world is pretty terrifying.

478
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:15,800
老友  你裡面有只死貓嗎?
Hey, buddy, you got a dead cat in there or what?

479
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:20,970
可能的回應: 是  不是或走開

480
01:14:21,350 --> 01:14:22,140
去你的  混蛋

481
01:14:23,190 --> 01:14:25,230
去你的  混蛋
Fuck you, asshole.

482
01:14:33,090 --> 01:14:35,890

這個夠不夠?
Is this enough?

487
01:14:56,140 --> 01:15:00,260
夠了  我不想問你從哪得來的
Yeah, it's enough. I don't wanna ask where you got it.

488

-來了  -我們要一個房間

-好的  -要有廚房
-Ok.  -With a kitchen.

490

有沒有廚房的?
Do you have one with a kitchen?

491
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:29,490
我很想洗澡
I am dying for a shower.

我要知道在哪能找到你

你叫我躲在小屋裡

498
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:19,620
但你卻不告訴我怎麼回事
and you won't tell me what's going on?

499
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,000

It's a nitroglycerin base. It's a bit more stable.

514

我小時候學會的
I learned to make it when I was a kid.

He'll find us, won't he?

523
01:18:28,380 --> 01:18:30,420
可能吧
Probably.

524
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,480
這件事永遠不會完結  對嗎?
It'll never be over, will it?

525
01:18:58,450 --> 01:19:00,690
看看我  我在顫抖
Look at me. I'm shaking.

526
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:06,900
好一個傳奇人物  你一定很失望了
Some legend. You must be pretty disappointed.

527
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:11,660
不是  我沒有失望
No, I'm not.

528
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:24,800
凱爾  你那個時代的女人
Kyle, the women in your time,

529
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,220
她們是怎樣的?
what are they like?

530
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:32,180
是精銳的戰士
Good fighters.

531
01:19:32,310 --> 01:19:34,980
我不是那個意思
That's not what I meant.

532
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:39,020
有沒有意中人?
Was there someone special?

533
01:19:40,490 --> 01:19:42,310
意中人?
Someone...?

534
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:44,690
女孩子
A girl, you know.

535
01:19:46,200 --> 01:19:48,240
沒有
No.

536
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:52,620
從來沒有
Never.

537
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:55,750
從來沒有?
Never?

538
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:03,580
我很難過  我真的很難過
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

539
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,800
這麼多痛苦
So much pain.

540
01:20:09,970 --> 01:20:14,430
痛苦是可以抑制的  只要你不去想它
Pain can be controlled. You just disconnect it.

541
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:17,890
那麼你沒有感覺?
So you feel nothing?

542
01:20:22,070 --> 01:20:25,150
約翰·康納曾經給我一張你的照片
John Connor gave me a picture of you once.

543
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,910
當時我不明白原因
I didn't know why at the time.

544
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:36,040
它很舊了  有點破爛  也褪色了
It was very old, torn, faded.

545
01:20:39,710 --> 01:20:46,210
你當時很年輕  就像現在一樣  看來有點悲傷
You were young like you are now. You seemed just a little sad.

546
01:20:47,300 --> 01:20:51,460
我時常猜想你當時在想什麼
I used to always wonder what you were thinking at that moment.

547
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,100
我謹記著每一條線
I memorised every line,

548
01:20:55,220 --> 01:20:57,260
每一條曲線
every curve.

549
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:04,480
薩拉  我穿越了時空來找你
I came across time for you, Sarah.

550
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:08,820
我愛你  我一直愛著你
I love you. I always have.

551
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:29,170
我不該那樣說的
I shouldn't have said that.

552
01:22:59,470 --> 01:23:02,140
想快點
Think fast.

553
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:32,720
交換位置
Trade places.

554
01:24:43,070 --> 01:24:46,680
快點  開快點
Faster. Drive faster.

555
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:39,490
凱爾  我的天
Kyle. Oh, my God.

556
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,270
混蛋

557
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:49,550
你別走開
You stay here.

558
01:27:12,370 --> 01:27:14,410
我們快離開
Let's get outta here.

559
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:19,450
下車
Get out.

560
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:38,520
凱爾  站起來
Kyle. Come on. Get up.

561
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:45,840
幫我
Help me.

562
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:49,700
來吧
Come on.

563
01:27:50,780 --> 01:27:53,660
幫我  快走...
Help me. Get out. Get out.

564
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:55,420
走
Get out.

565
01:28:13,140 --> 01:28:14,200
快點
Faster.

566
01:28:17,810 --> 01:28:20,300
不要停  走
Don't stop. Run.

567
01:30:32,520 --> 01:30:34,760
薩拉?
Sarah.

568
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:36,730
凱爾
Kyle.

569
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,240
凱爾  我們成功了  我們成功了
We did it, Kyle. We got him.

570
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:10,050
不
No.

571
01:32:07,780 --> 01:32:09,270
等一會
Wait.

572
01:32:13,830 --> 01:32:16,230
你幹什麼?
What are you doing?

573
01:32:16,370 --> 01:32:18,690
掩護  令它追蹤不到我們
Cover, so he can't track us.

574
01:32:20,030 --> 01:32:21,010
啟動自動序列

575
01:32:29,220 --> 01:32:31,670
快點  來吧
Come on.

576
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:36,180
不  凱爾  來吧
No. Kyle. Come on.

577
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:40,140
-來吧  -別理會我
-Come on.  -Leave me here.

578
01:32:49,860 --> 01:32:54,490
快走  李斯  站起來  士兵
Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.

579
01:32:54,610 --> 01:32:58,070
站起來  快走
On your feet. Move it.

580
01:34:10,140 --> 01:34:12,180
後面  去後面
Get back. Go back.

581
01:34:46,550 --> 01:34:48,430
-薩拉  快逃  -不
-Run, Sarah.  -No.

582
01:34:48,550 --> 01:34:50,300
快跑
Run.

583
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,390
快跑
Run.

584
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:58,140
來吧  混蛋
Come on, mother fucker.

585
01:36:50,590 --> 01:36:52,410
不...
No.

586
01:38:43,370 --> 01:38:44,400
啟動卸貨

587
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,320
混蛋  你被毀滅了
You're terminated, fucker.

588
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:52,760
凱爾
Kyle.

589
01:40:13,170 --> 01:40:15,170
第7個錄音 11月10日
Tape 7, November 10th.

590
01:40:15,270 --> 01:40:16,780
我說到哪裡?
Where was I?

591
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:21,780
最難決定的是該告訴你什麼和不告訴你什麼
What's difficult is trying to decide what to tell you and what not to.

592
01:40:22,290 --> 01:40:23,620
我還有時間考慮
But I guess I have a while

593
01:40:23,620 --> 01:40:26,620
在你長大到明白這些錄音之前
before you're old enough to understand these tapes

594
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:31,710
現在來說 這些錄音只是給我自己的  好讓我理清頭緒
They're more for me at this point just so that I can get it straight.

595
01:41:07,660 --> 01:41:09,700
入滿它
Fill her up.

596
01:41:13,130 --> 01:41:15,750
我是否該告訴你  關於你父親的事?
Should I tell you about your father?

597
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:18,120
孩子 那是個難題
Boy, that's a tough one.

598
01:41:19,630 --> 01:41:21,900
會影響你派他來這的決定嗎
Will it effect your decision to send him here

599
01:41:21,900 --> 01:41:25,300
知道他是你父親
knowing that he is your father?

600
01:41:26,270 --> 01:41:29,140
如果你不派凱爾來  就不會有你
If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.

601
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:32,350
天  想著這件事會使人發瘋的
God, a person could go crazy thinking about this.

602
01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:39,480
我相信我會告訴你的
I suppose I will tell you.

603
01:41:39,610 --> 01:41:41,850
這是我至少該做的
I owe him that.

604
01:41:44,030 --> 01:41:46,490
也許這有幫助的  如果...
Maybe it'll help if...

605
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:51,780
你知道這個 在我們共處的短暫的時光裡
you know that in the few hours that we had together,

606
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:56,290
我們愛了一生一世
we loved a lifetime's worth.

607
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:12,640
-他剛剛說什麼?  -他說  "小姐  你很漂亮"
-What did he just say?  -He says you're very beautiful.

608
01:42:12,770 --> 01:42:15,850
他不敢問你拿五元的照相費
He is ashamed to ask you for five dollars for this picture.

609
01:42:15,980 --> 01:42:19,310
但如果他不問你要  他父親就會打他
But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.

610
01:42:19,440 --> 01:42:22,440
孩子  真會做生意
Pretty good hustle, kid.

611
01:42:38,580 --> 01:42:40,790
他剛剛說什麼?
What did he just say?

612
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:44,000
他說 有一場風暴要來了
He said there's a storm coming in.

613
01:42:47,510 --> 01:42:49,550
我知道
I know.

614
01:43:15,350 --> 01:43:21,250
鳴謝赫倫·艾裡遜
