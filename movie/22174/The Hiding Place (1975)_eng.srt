00:00:10,527 --> 00:00:12,762
THIS IS A TRUE STORY.
She was taken...

00:00:12,814 --> 00:00:14,946
THE WRITINGS
PERSONAL AND MEMORIES...

00:00:14,998 --> 00:00:18,101
Corrie ten Boom, HER FAMILY
OTHER THAN WITH THEM...

00:00:18,153 --> 00:00:20,262
Face the darkness.

00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:48,222
THE SECRET REFUGE

6
00:04:02,025 --> 00:04:07,297
Haarlem, Netherlands, Spring 1940

7
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:09,280
<i>a BBC broadcast,</i>

00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,568
<i>His Majesty

00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,186
<i>Dear Dutch,</i>

10
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:19,257
<i>the lights went down
free over the Netherlands.</i>

11
00:04:19,309 --> 00:04:24,262
<i>Two weeks ago we were a
nation of free men and women</i>

12
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:28,951
<i>created in estimated tradition
of Christian civilization,</i>

13
00:04:29,003 --> 00:04:32,522
<i>and now there is the silence of death.</i>

14
00:04:32,574 --> 00:04:35,000
<i>oppressed, threatened...</i>

15
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:37,375
<i>watched everywhere...</i>

16
00:04:37,427 --> 00:04:42,647
<i>by a power that can remove
all hope of man's soul.</i>

17
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:48,538
<i>the unhappy people of Holland
only remains to pray in silence,</i>

18
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,088
<i>for those who lost their voice...</i>

19
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,044

Café..

23
00:05:37,353 --> 00:05:39,719
...In the living room.

24
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:48,846
<i>Attention! Caution</i>

25
00:05:48,898 --> 00:05:51,282

<i>and any other equipment

32
00:06:18,594 --> 00:06:21,227
Good morning, Mr. Ten Boom.

33
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:23,861
I apologize for the intrusion.

34
00:06:24,367 --> 00:06:27,603
- They are collecting all the radios.
- I see.

35
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:30,613
And Dutch police to help!

36
00:06:30,665 --> 00:06:33,571
We do what we are commanded.

37
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:36,929
<i>All citizens
must surrender their radios.</i>

38
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,116
- A radio, does it?
- Upstairs in the living room!

39
00:06:40,168 --> 00:06:42,607
Take it.

40
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,950
You have many nice watches here.

41
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:56,896
Bavarian?

42
00:06:57,233 --> 00:07:00,102
The box appears to be
Style Berringer.

43
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:03,435
Yes, 1886.

44
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,676
Well you know... watches?

45
00:07:06,728 --> 00:07:09,301
My father is a watchmaker.

46
00:07:09,353 --> 00:07:11,875
I grew up under his desk.

47
00:07:12,048 --> 00:07:15,415
And look what it became.

48
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:20,453
- What city?
- Mattenbraw.

49
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,654
Mattenbraw...

50
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,125
Mattenbraw, 1895.

51
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,503
- Splendid.
- You should have seen the state...

52
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:35,052
when he arrived here.

53
00:07:35,104 --> 00:07:38,307
The way some people
treat a clock without care...

54
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:41,425
without... understanding.

55
00:07:41,477 --> 00:07:45,106
It was a gift in my
70th birthday.

56
00:07:47,116 --> 00:07:50,753
"When Grandpa Ten Boom
Children of Haarlem.

57
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:54,553
March 26, 1935. "

58
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:58,018
Give him the speaker.

59
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:03,589
- Over any radio in the house?
- No, no.

60
00:08:06,702 --> 00:08:09,068
Good day then.

61
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:35,388
JEWS ARE NOT WELCOME

62
00:08:45,308 --> 00:08:47,868
FORBIDDEN TO JEWS

63
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:03,626
Quena not anything too expensive,
understand?

64
00:09:03,678 --> 00:09:05,576
Then there's one here...

65
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,479
seven rubies, manufacturing whisker,

66
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:13,135
but all the craftsmen are
German immigrants. It costs 42 guilders.

67
00:09:13,187 --> 00:09:17,239
It's a birthday present.
I spend a little more.

68
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:19,390
Well, we have this...

69
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:23,913
Bamendor style.
Excuse me.

70
00:09:23,965 --> 00:09:27,041
Daddy, is leaving?

71
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:33,018
I will not be hanging around this house
doing nothing.

72
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:35,583
Dad?

73
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,630
Excuse me...

74
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:43,064
Sorry.

75
00:09:46,202 --> 00:09:48,037
Yes..

76
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:49,820
See...

77
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:52,790
you can have notched lo...

78
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,412
or you can order in lo...
white gold.

79
00:09:56,464 --> 00:09:58,262
The white gold costs 60.

80
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:00,798
<i>...residents
in occupied Holland</i>

81
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:05,412
<i>must present themselves as
the following rules.</i>

82
00:10:05,821 --> 00:10:08,624
<i>- Someone is considered Jewish...
- Take your star.</i>

83
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:11,041
<i>Or partly Jewish if...
- Next.</i>

84
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:16,224
<i>At least one grandparent
of Jewish origin.</i>

85
00:10:16,432 --> 00:10:19,216
<i>A grandparent is considered Jewish</i>

86
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:23,806
<i>one belongs or has belonged
a synagogue.</i>

87
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:29,259
You should not be here.

88
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:31,642
I came for my star.

89
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,598
They are for the Jews.

90
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,721
You do not have a "J"
in his identity card.

91
00:10:38,773 --> 00:10:41,690
You could get it for me.

92
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,027
If they do not we use all
know the difference between...

93
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:47,928
a Gentile and a Jew.

94
00:10:48,164 --> 00:10:50,700
Go home, please.

95
00:10:50,752 --> 00:10:52,998
Go home.

96
00:10:54,203 --> 00:10:56,487
I will use my star!

97
00:10:56,539 --> 00:11:01,744
And I will not take it until
God says I should take it!

98
00:11:01,796 --> 00:11:04,580
The God of Abraham and Isaac...

99
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:06,275
and my God, too!

100
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:09,217
Leader who?

101
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:21,294
Come on, hurry.
Let's go there!

102
00:11:23,332 --> 00:11:24,782
Good day...

103
00:11:24,834 --> 00:11:27,564
Not Miss. Ten Boom?

104
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:29,705
Children, stop.

105
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:33,337
The watch?

106
00:11:33,809 --> 00:11:36,937
Ten Boom, street Berteljorisstraat!

107
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:39,943
You took our radio.

108
00:11:41,517 --> 00:11:43,467
I wrote to my father.

109
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,789
- I told him about his shop.
- Who are these guys?

110
00:11:46,841 --> 00:11:50,092
Why do not prevent
to disturb the man?

111
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:52,409
They are young Dutch patriots.

112
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:57,767
They say he made derogatory remarks
the Reich and our Fuehrer.

113
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:00,636
Are expressing their outrage.

114
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:02,797
Patriots?

115
00:12:04,673 --> 00:12:07,540
Who are these kids?

116
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,145
They are my students.

117
00:12:10,197 --> 00:12:12,804
Talk to them about God.

118
00:12:12,856 --> 00:12:15,412
At least that's what I did.

119
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,701
This will be the last class.

120
00:12:17,753 --> 00:12:21,874
Through the new orders
on unauthorized meetings.

121
00:12:21,926 --> 00:12:26,129
Mlle. Ten Boom...
the measures are temporary.

122
00:12:26,181 --> 00:12:30,280
When all this has passed
and order is restored,

123
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:35,292
then all will live together Aryans
as our brothers in the Reich.

124
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:41,544
Men live together as brothers
only in the kingdom of our Lord.

125
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:43,978
Nowhere.

126
00:12:45,047 --> 00:12:47,538
Can we go?

127
00:12:49,785 --> 00:12:52,379
Come... yes.

128
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,578
Children... Children...

129
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,594
Come on! Come on!

130
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:20,297
Grab some cookies. Yes..

131
00:13:20,349 --> 00:13:23,352
Jan always comes running
for the wafers.

132
00:13:23,404 --> 00:13:25,402
Lisa, yes.

133
00:13:25,454 --> 00:13:28,787
Carol... ah, yes!

134
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:32,258
Ha! Biscuits?

135
00:13:37,366 --> 00:13:41,735
I can not then be
with you for a while.

136
00:13:43,272 --> 00:13:46,764
But Jesus is still here...

137
00:13:46,976 --> 00:13:50,070
always looking out for you.

138
00:13:52,882 --> 00:13:57,080
See... without Jesus,

139
00:13:57,319 --> 00:13:59,388
we are thus.

140
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,754
Empty!

141
00:14:02,391 --> 00:14:04,985
We can not do anything.

142
00:14:07,329 --> 00:14:11,367
But when Jesus fills us with...

143
00:14:11,419 --> 00:14:13,927
with His love,

144
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:18,803
then we complete.
Yes!

145
00:14:20,676 --> 00:14:23,372
We can do anything.

146
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,975
We can do anything.

147
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:32,154
Nothing serious, pastor.
Maybe just a bit dirty.

148
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,723
He is delaying
5 seconds per day.

149
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:37,326
Maybe a good cleaning solved.

150
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,621
You can do it now?

151
00:14:39,673 --> 00:14:41,812
While I'm here...

152
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:44,233
really would be great.

153
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:45,810
Sure!

154
00:14:45,862 --> 00:14:47,284
Great!

155
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:50,704
I'll go up and talk
with his Father

156
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:54,073
I heard he is
wearing a Jewish star.

157
00:14:55,444 --> 00:15:01,684
Stubbornness is the daughter of pride, and pride
is the first of the seven deadly sins.

158
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:04,201
I'll talk to him about it.

159
00:15:04,253 --> 00:15:07,456
I need to be
back to the church at 1:30.

160
00:15:07,508 --> 00:15:09,924
Will be ready.

161
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,582
Dr. Heemstra!

162
00:15:17,634 --> 00:15:19,616
Mlle. Ten Boom.

163
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,535
I can only stay a moment.

164
00:15:41,757 --> 00:15:44,441
We need milk for him,
no soup.

165
00:15:44,493 --> 00:15:47,894
Good heavens, I hope
not intend to stay with him!

166
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,926
But they can not!

167
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,095
It's illegal!

168
00:15:57,239 --> 00:15:59,541
You may all be arrested!

169
00:15:59,593 --> 00:16:02,203
He's gorgeous.

170
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:06,406
Pastor...

171
00:16:07,783 --> 00:16:11,134
You were sent by God!

172
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:13,322
Do you live in the countryside!

173
00:16:13,374 --> 00:16:15,791
Nothing could be safer!

174
00:16:15,843 --> 00:16:17,934
This is...

175
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:20,025
impossible.

176
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:25,094
I have my family to look after.

177
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:29,772
We could lose everything
because of this child.

178
00:16:29,824 --> 00:16:33,675
What would my church
without a shepherd?

179
00:16:33,727 --> 00:16:36,473
- Ah, but...
- No, Betsie!

180
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,429
The minister has decided.

181
00:16:39,481 --> 00:16:44,214
It's the law!
And Christians should obey the law!

182
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,457
Think of the risk they are running,

183
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:51,286
because of a Jewish baby.

184
00:16:51,338 --> 00:16:54,011
Will give us away, pastor,

185
00:16:54,063 --> 00:16:58,383
if the baby gets
for a time with us?

186
00:16:58,435 --> 00:17:02,652
Corrie...
must obey the state law

187
00:17:02,704 --> 00:17:06,868
if it is not against
the higher law of God.

188
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:13,849
Pastor, you want
I no longer wear the star.

189
00:17:13,901 --> 00:17:17,307
Okay, do not I will.

190
00:17:18,487 --> 00:17:21,513
But we are left with the baby.

191
00:17:25,327 --> 00:17:27,477
As a Christian...

192
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:31,233
I regret that any
Man has to suffer;

193
00:17:31,285 --> 00:17:35,419
no matter who
or their race.

194
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:40,932
- But remember, are the Jews...
- Who gave us the Bible...

195
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,609
and our Savior!

196
00:17:50,719 --> 00:17:53,187
Be as you wish.

197
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,886
I take my watch tomorrow.

198
00:18:01,263 --> 00:18:03,788
Good Morning, Ten Boom.

199
00:18:04,766 --> 00:18:06,791
Ladies.

200
00:18:09,371 --> 00:18:12,806
God forgive him.
He had no bad intention.

201
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,242
How can he
to give the title of a Christian?

202
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:19,496
Living in a cookie jar

203
00:18:19,548 --> 00:18:23,450
does not make a mouse
a wafer.

204
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,536
What do we do?

205
00:18:26,588 --> 00:18:30,319
- We need milk!
- He has to go to the field.

206
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,376
Beware, it will choke him up.

207
00:18:33,428 --> 00:18:36,313
- Where will send him?
- Only God knows.

208
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,548
The doors are opening
throughout the Netherlands.

209
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,594
Last week a farmer and a
Baroness slept in the same bed.

210
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:49,710
And now you have
a little Moses in a basket.

211
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,785
Corrie, please.

212
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,980
Thanks.

213
00:19:00,789 --> 00:19:04,316
- Willem!
- He can not cry!

214
00:19:05,827 --> 00:19:10,287
- You are very organized.
- Oh, is not the first time.

215
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,901
We helped in the escape of Jews...

216
00:19:15,037 --> 00:19:17,801
for a day or a week.

217
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,457
He hid it from us, Willem?

218
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:24,413
Before they were German Jews,
and now the Dutch.

219
00:19:24,465 --> 00:19:27,041
We do what we can.

220
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:31,743
The Nazis only happy when
there are no Jews in Europe.

221
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:36,625
They hurt the girl's eyes
of God. I have for them.

222
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:38,775
- I hate them.
- Ah, Corrie...

223
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:42,422
You can not hate someone
and walk with the Lord.

224
00:19:43,865 --> 00:19:46,750
You could have told us,
Willem, we would have helped.

225
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:49,404
The most important thing is to take
our little friend here.

226
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:52,007
It would be hard to explain
this sudden gift of heaven.

227
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,343
Son, I'll walk
with you a little.

228
00:19:54,395 --> 00:19:56,092
Goodbye, Moses.

229
00:19:56,144 --> 00:20:00,582
We're doing well.
Sometimes we have some potatoes...

230
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:03,500
and occasionally even eggs!

231
00:20:03,552 --> 00:20:07,750
So far we have not been bad.
And of course...

232
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,662
- This is a peasant?
- Grandpa!

233
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:16,146
Kik, you got anything?

234
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,834
The carbon in the waste basket,

235
00:20:18,886 --> 00:20:21,470
lo if you hold the light,
can see.

236
00:20:21,522 --> 00:20:23,768
Thanks.

237
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,956
See, Papa...

238
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:29,876
- We have a contact in the Gestapo...
- Quiet!

239
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,139
It provides us with deportation lists
whenever he can.

240
00:20:36,418 --> 00:20:38,909
Alright, Kik?

241
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,606
Bye, Grandpa.

242
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:46,924
- God bless you, Kik.
- Hold tight to the hand... good!

243
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,191
Pope...

244
00:20:56,038 --> 00:20:57,721
Now every day...

245
00:20:57,773 --> 00:21:02,403
they are sending 400 Jews
Central Station in Amsterdam.

246
00:21:02,611 --> 00:21:05,739
Help those who can.

247
00:21:06,315 --> 00:21:09,978
We know someone on the list?

248
00:22:23,525 --> 00:22:25,861
- Sorry.
- No, please...

249
00:22:25,913 --> 00:22:28,545
sorry...

250
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,532
for disturbing los.

251
00:22:51,553 --> 00:22:54,044
Maybe he...

252
00:22:58,193 --> 00:23:02,097
Dad...
There is a gentleman up there.

253
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,747
We met.

254
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:06,468
- Well, it was too late...
- He had nowhere to go.

255
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,251
Daddy, he is a teacher.

256
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:11,239
Willem studied with him.
They closed the university.

257
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:13,775
All Jewish teachers
were forced...

258
00:23:13,827 --> 00:23:15,970
Ah, Betsie...

259
00:23:17,012 --> 00:23:19,662
Good morning again, professor.

260
00:23:19,714 --> 00:23:24,820
I apologize for the intrusion,
Mr. Ten Boom.

261
00:23:24,872 --> 00:23:26,928
Please...

262
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,985
Thanks.

263
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,415
Professor...

264
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:42,699
Give us the honor
praying thanking?

265
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,912
<i>Blessed art thou...</i>

266
00:23:53,215 --> 00:23:56,582
<i>O Lord our God,</i>

267
00:23:56,785 --> 00:24:00,422
<i>you give us the bread of earth.</i>

268
00:24:00,474 --> 00:24:03,851
Amen

269
00:24:13,301 --> 00:24:16,204
How lucky that Aunt Bep
had large feet.

270
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:18,399
Is.

271
00:24:18,907 --> 00:24:22,844
E... what is your date of birth?

272
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:25,039
Birth?

273
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:31,970
August 19, 1885.

274
00:24:32,022 --> 00:24:34,857
Name of the Father?

275
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:37,692
Casper Ten Boom.

276
00:24:37,744 --> 00:24:39,409
Mother?

277
00:24:39,461 --> 00:24:42,380
Cornelia Ten Boom.

278
00:24:42,432 --> 00:24:45,034
Her maiden name?

279
00:24:45,086 --> 00:24:47,912
Mlle. Ten Boom...

280
00:24:47,964 --> 00:24:50,687
If we stopped, I...

281
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,608
I could never
I pass you by.

282
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,492
Professor Ziener...

283
00:24:55,544 --> 00:24:58,747
There is no "if" in God's world.

284
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,297
He brought
this house;

285
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:04,785
and you will see that
depart in safety.

286
00:25:06,788 --> 00:25:10,458
This is where we turn, teacher.
Stay close to me.

287
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,722
I'll try.

288
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:53,063
Well done, professor!
We're almost there.

289
00:25:57,672 --> 00:26:00,869
- Katrien!
- Tia Corrie!

290
00:26:03,011 --> 00:26:05,741
- Tia Corrie!
- Katrien!

291
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,264
I need help from his father.

292
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,301
You should have seen the teacher Ziener
entering the boat.

293
00:26:11,353 --> 00:26:16,558
Katrien's father as if he were helping
Queen Willemina entering the yacht!

294
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:20,161
Cornelia, do you think is
having too much fun with this?

295
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:22,045
Me having fun?

296
00:26:22,097 --> 00:26:24,614
No, I was terrified.

297
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:28,837
Except when kept
to laugh at him dressed as Betsie...

298
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:33,356
Thank God.
He kept away from the patrols.

299
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:36,077
Remember to save a piece
cake for a friend of Willem.

300
00:26:36,129 --> 00:26:37,427
Friend?

301
00:26:37,479 --> 00:26:39,914
It's all very mysterious.

302
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:42,298
Is anyone he wants
we know.

303
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:46,687
What you said when Willem
Professor Ziener told him?

304
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:51,024
This is not a joke to
when they want to have fun.

305
00:26:51,626 --> 00:26:54,911
If you get involved
this work

306
00:26:54,963 --> 00:26:58,950
people have to
entrust their lives to you!

307
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:02,937
I told you, Willem.
We gave him my documents.

308
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:06,141
We plan everything
very carefully.

309
00:27:06,193 --> 00:27:08,309
And if they questioned the...

310
00:27:08,361 --> 00:27:10,211
Does he sing soprano?

311
00:27:10,263 --> 00:27:12,161
No!

312
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:17,052
He had a...
sore throat.

313
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:19,316
Excuse me.

314
00:27:20,088 --> 00:27:25,827
But you walk around
picking people at random?

315
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:28,129
How did they know
they could trust him?

316
00:27:28,181 --> 00:27:29,879
I knew him.

317
00:27:29,931 --> 00:27:32,467
And he knew what the Lord told me.

318
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,450
Pope...

319
00:27:34,502 --> 00:27:37,903
You're the boss of this house.

320
00:27:38,707 --> 00:27:41,505
The head of this house...

321
00:27:41,609 --> 00:27:47,377
orders that the door is opened
anyone to beat.

322
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,901
We can not afford to
skip to anybody

323
00:27:51,953 --> 00:27:56,515
to engage seriously in this work,
regardless of their methods.

324
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,622
Perhaps allow us to...
help with this.

325
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:45,170
Thanks for the delivery, Mr. Smit.

326
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:52,109
Only for emergencies!

327
00:28:53,114 --> 00:28:54,897
We have a contact in the phone,

328
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:58,653
but you never know
if the line is not bugged.

329
00:28:58,705 --> 00:29:02,857
We hope to develop
their own sources.

330
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,683
The less contact
have me,

331
00:29:05,735 --> 00:29:08,458
or any other...
better.

332
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:12,450
Willem,
know half of Haarlem.

333
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:15,585
We have friends everywhere!

334
00:29:15,637 --> 00:29:19,555
My dear,
los know it's something...

335
00:29:19,607 --> 00:29:23,845
- Know their political stances...
- God knows!

336
00:29:23,897 --> 00:29:26,763
And ask Him to guide us.

337
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:30,751
We understand your concern,
Mr. Sluring.

338
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,339
We are not the perfect candidate.

339
00:29:36,391 --> 00:29:41,988
But since there is a need,
should do everything possible to service it.

340
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:46,167
People have the most varied reasons
want to work secretly,

341
00:29:46,219 --> 00:29:48,761
emotion, perhaps.

342
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:53,689
Mr. Sluring,

343
00:29:53,741 --> 00:30:00,748
have passed the age at which the emotion
was important in our lives.

344
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,114
Actually...

345
00:30:03,351 --> 00:30:06,469
rather do anything else.

346
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:10,792
I wish to close the door
and not open it anymore.

347
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:14,558
Until all this horror
has ended.

348
00:30:14,696 --> 00:30:17,028
But that's me.

349
00:30:17,465 --> 00:30:19,949
My Lord Jesus...

350
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:24,495
says to open the door
for anyone who comes.

351
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:29,299
Share His love
the way I can.

352
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,348
And I will listen to his voice...

353
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,680
and not mine.

354
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:41,721
We passed the inspection?

355
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:47,390
How can you get?

356
00:30:47,896 --> 00:30:52,200
We... Mom's room,
your old room

357
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:56,504
Aunt Anna's room,
Bep aunt's room

358
00:30:56,556 --> 00:30:58,387
and our 3/4... are 7.

359
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,476
We can sleep in the same bed
if necessary.

360
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:05,313
So, our hotel is ready
for guests.

361
00:31:05,365 --> 00:31:07,611
Not yet.

362
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,544
What will
the Gestapo appear?

363
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:17,957
You will receive a visit
Jan Smit.

364
00:31:18,026 --> 00:31:20,309
There are actually two houses.

365
00:31:20,361 --> 00:31:24,031
For over 100 years
they were joined.

366
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:27,702
The front has 2 rooms
a long and wide.

367
00:31:27,754 --> 00:31:30,147
The back, here...

368
00:31:30,199 --> 00:31:32,488
has 3 bedrooms.

369
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,373
On top of one another.

370
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:38,846
Pope, this is Mr. Smit.

371
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:40,196
Mr. Smit.

372
00:31:40,248 --> 00:31:44,485
I know some Smits in Amsterdam.
And the family that Smit...

373
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:47,522
Father, this is the man
I told you about.

374
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:51,014
He came to
inspect the house.

375
00:31:51,092 --> 00:31:53,242
A building inspector?

376
00:31:53,294 --> 00:31:56,345
It's yours office
Grote Street in the Hous?

377
00:31:56,397 --> 00:32:01,169
No, Papa, he is not building inspector,
and his name is Smit.

378
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:03,352
- Not Smit?
- Excuse me, Papa.

379
00:32:03,404 --> 00:32:06,464
We have to see the rest of the house.

380
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:13,407
The living room...

381
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:23,150
Mealtime...
is preferred for a hit.

382
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,958
Beware the dumps...

383
00:32:27,829 --> 00:32:30,059
and ashtrays.

384
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,718
We need a place
the highest possible.

385
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:41,037
Increases the chances of escape to a place
safe while looking down.

386
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:47,176
- These are all rooms?
- Yes.

387
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:50,866
If there is a night raid,

388
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:53,302
will have to take
their bedding,

389
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:56,172
and can not forget
to flip the mattress.

390
00:32:56,224 --> 00:33:00,895
The favorite trick of the Gestapo
is feeling the heat of the bed.

391
00:33:00,947 --> 00:33:03,295
What's up there?

392
00:33:14,342 --> 00:33:18,904
The roof is just above.
Who sleeps here?

393
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,280
I sleep.

394
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,313
Perfect!

395
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:32,260
The wall... will be...

396
00:33:32,312 --> 00:33:34,421
here!

397
00:33:48,076 --> 00:33:51,375
Alright!
The sign is in the window.

398
00:33:58,152 --> 00:34:01,821
You see,
There is a different brand,

399
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:05,491
we can always recognize
a Flenstadht.

400
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,569
What a beautiful day, Aunt Betsie.

401
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:17,231
Peter, no!

402
00:34:19,707 --> 00:34:22,870
- I turn to look on Tuesday, then.
- Good

403
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:28,345
Mlle. Ten Boom!

404
00:34:30,785 --> 00:34:33,117
Frisian!

405
00:34:33,187 --> 00:34:36,088
That beautiful wood!

406
00:34:37,458 --> 00:34:39,608
My father has already made a box like that.

407
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,962
Ah, he spent months riding
polishing, varnishing.

408
00:34:45,733 --> 00:34:47,450
But it's just a case...

409
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:51,131
we need to put
inside a machine.

410
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:54,772
How much will it cost?

411
00:34:56,177 --> 00:35:01,205
Well, it'll take months to assemble lo.

412
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,883
Name your price.

413
00:35:04,935 --> 00:35:07,116
Steep until I paid.

414
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,587
I liked the clock.

415
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:15,630
- Can I afford the best!
- But...

416
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:18,432
not have machine!

417
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,525
None.

418
00:35:21,936 --> 00:35:24,234
Very good.

419
00:35:25,606 --> 00:35:28,632
Tuesday, Mr. Ten Boom.

420
00:35:36,517 --> 00:35:39,111
Kik! Quick!

421
00:35:42,023 --> 00:35:45,526
Aunt Betsie, how many times
I have to tell you?

422
00:35:45,578 --> 00:35:49,030
Take the sign of the window
when it is not safe!

423
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:51,180
Kik...

424
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,963
Sorry. Sorry!

425
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,898
Grandpa... just look!

426
00:36:10,284 --> 00:36:12,484
Tea, Mr. Smit?

427
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:14,685
Ah, thank you!

428
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,529
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

429
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:32,840
- Good morning.
- Milk!

430
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:35,610
No milk! Ink!

431
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,126
Ink?

432
00:36:37,178 --> 00:36:40,262
Betsie! Betsie!

433
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:43,199
Remember
Fred Koonstra?

434
00:36:43,251 --> 00:36:47,588
Sure, it made reading
our clock by light years.

435
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,524
Her daughter was our student.

436
00:36:50,576 --> 00:36:53,594
- Milk!
- Ink.

437
00:36:53,646 --> 00:36:55,811
Ink!

438
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:57,880
Elsie Koonstra.

439
00:36:57,932 --> 00:37:03,070
I know her name, I'm trying
remember some faces.

440
00:37:03,122 --> 00:37:05,421
She must have some
twenties now.

441
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:09,677
Yesterday I learned that Fred works Koonstra
the department of nutrition.

442
00:37:09,729 --> 00:37:11,727
Where?

443
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:14,771
Where to send
ration coupons.

444
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:31,397
I'll be frank.
We had unexpected visitors.

445
00:37:31,899 --> 00:37:34,383
First, a baby...

446
00:37:34,435 --> 00:37:38,599
then a man,
and last night a couple.

447
00:37:39,707 --> 00:37:42,938
All Jews, Mr. Koonstra.

448
00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:46,744
Why do I say that?

449
00:37:47,915 --> 00:37:51,365
Remains only 3 of us
home now.

450
00:37:51,417 --> 00:37:54,816
My father, my sister and me.

451
00:37:54,922 --> 00:37:58,192
And our ration coupons
are not sufficient.

452
00:37:58,244 --> 00:38:01,135
All coupons are conferred.

453
00:38:01,187 --> 00:38:04,026
Are checked
in several ways.

454
00:38:04,799 --> 00:38:08,565
Yes! Yes! I know.

455
00:38:10,137 --> 00:38:13,470
I should not have asked for.

456
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,428
I thought maybe you
could help me.

457
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,678
The office in Utrecht
was stolen last week.

458
00:38:24,352 --> 00:38:27,378
- The men were caught.
- And dead.

459
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:35,818
If it had been at noon, when
just me and another employee are there...

460
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:41,566
We would have to be tied
and gagged.

461
00:38:44,038 --> 00:38:46,973
How many coupons
do you need?

462
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:50,309
Hundred!

463
00:38:50,378 --> 00:38:53,677
I know someone
you can achieve.

464
00:39:05,226 --> 00:39:08,127
Pope, now!

465
00:39:11,632 --> 00:39:13,759
Papa!

466
00:39:34,488 --> 00:39:36,190
- Ready.
- How long?

467
00:39:36,242 --> 00:39:38,474
47/2!

468
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:42,394
It is better not to send
nobody bigger than me.

469
00:39:42,830 --> 00:39:45,094
Hallelujah!

470
00:39:45,199 --> 00:39:50,501
Our Lord, we ask Thy blessing
on this secret hideaway.

471
00:39:52,072 --> 00:39:54,438
Eat what you want!

472
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:58,128
- Herren, is not kosher.
- Do not worry.

473
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:01,582
Could you pass the potatoes,
please?

474
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:02,731
My God!

475
00:40:02,783 --> 00:40:06,446
Go, go, go! Go!

476
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,106
Quick, quick.

477
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:15,959
One in the head, another on the other hand,
and one on each side.

478
00:40:17,965 --> 00:40:20,490
You're spilling!

479
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,347
Corrie?

480
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:49,019
A minute and 15 seconds.

481
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:53,026
That's long enough
to wrap the stomach.

482
00:41:11,652 --> 00:41:13,869
Peace be to this house
and all that dwell therein.

483
00:41:13,921 --> 00:41:16,757
- The peace of the Lord God...
- Come in, do not get out there praying.

484
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:21,495
I hear you have accommodations.
I need a room for me

485
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:24,698
quiet to study,
preferably without children.

486
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:27,667
Well, can I stay?

487
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:31,939
Well, yes, I think so,
but there are many questions...

488
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,330
I would eat something.

489
00:41:35,382 --> 00:41:38,669
My meal was last Sunday.

490
00:41:38,846 --> 00:41:41,838
Thanks! At noon.

491
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:46,301
This house is kosher?

492
00:41:46,353 --> 00:41:49,456
Well, we tried, we have many requests
we can not answer.

493
00:41:49,508 --> 00:41:52,391
And no children?

494
00:41:52,493 --> 00:41:57,398
Well, not at the moment,
but they come and go.

495
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:00,434
Not coming
while I'm here.

496
00:42:00,486 --> 00:42:02,084
It's around here?

497
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,853
- Yes! But before...
- My contacts told me...

498
00:42:04,905 --> 00:42:09,410
that most of its guests are
in transit, are fleeing the country.

499
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:12,628
- Most, yes.
- Well, it's not my case.

500
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:17,399
I am a teacher and soloist
of Congregation Beth Kodesh.

501
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:22,790
I will not be taken by those German
and his thousand-year Reich.

502
00:42:22,842 --> 00:42:24,339
Who is this man?

503
00:42:24,391 --> 00:42:28,329
As a patriarch Isaac or Jacob,
father of nations.

504
00:42:28,381 --> 00:42:30,913
Papa, we have a new guest.

505
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,734
This is my father, Mr. Ten Boom.

506
00:42:33,786 --> 00:42:35,751
Pope, this is Mr...

507
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,806
Wijnstok, Meyer Wijnstok.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ten Boom.

508
00:42:38,858 --> 00:42:43,709
God willing
and the accommodations are good,

509
00:42:43,877 --> 00:42:47,014
I'll be with you
to end this madness.

510
00:42:47,066 --> 00:42:48,997
- You're welcome.
- Thanks.

511
00:42:49,049 --> 00:42:52,212
Mlle. Ten Boom,
my room, please.

512
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:10,819
Aunt Betsie!

513
00:43:10,871 --> 00:43:14,541
My friend needs a place Jan
to stay for a while.

514
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:16,491
He fled the train.

515
00:43:16,543 --> 00:43:19,313
At noon tomorrow will
new identity papers.

516
00:43:19,365 --> 00:43:20,963
But...

517
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:23,632
where they got the uniforms?

518
00:43:23,684 --> 00:43:26,320
Not all Germans
Nazis are, Aunt Betsie.

519
00:43:26,372 --> 00:43:28,811
His name is Jan?

520
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:35,229
Corrie! Mr. Wijnstock refused
helping in the kitchen again.

521
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,212
He has to study.

522
00:43:37,264 --> 00:43:40,968
If you want to eat, he has
to do their part in the work.

523
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:43,504
- Where is he now?
- In the living room.

524
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:48,032
Could I...
Oh, sorry! Sorry.

525
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:51,259
Corrie, he was upset today.

526
00:43:51,311 --> 00:43:55,082
He discovered that the call
of "Eusie" in the back.

527
00:43:55,134 --> 00:43:57,499
He was considered an honor.

528
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,120
I should be flattered to be
compared to a scholar!

529
00:44:00,172 --> 00:44:02,849
But a scholar Gentile. He said...

530
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,526
we should compare the lo Josephus.

531
00:44:05,578 --> 00:44:07,994
Rules are rules!

532
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:13,534
Mr. Wijnstok, my sister said
you refused...

533
00:44:13,586 --> 00:44:17,026
Mlle. Ten Boom, I'm praying.

534
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,244
Already refused to work on Saturday
because of the Sabbath.

535
00:44:24,296 --> 00:44:28,274
After he refused to work Sunday,
that was our day of rest.

536
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:32,252
I was just trying to respect
the customs of this house.

537
00:44:32,304 --> 00:44:34,280
But today is Tuesday.

538
00:44:34,332 --> 00:44:36,204
Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom,

539
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:39,493
because they found it necessary
give me a nickname?

540
00:44:39,545 --> 00:44:41,476
We call Eusie because...

541
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:45,726
Eusie is the kind of name
we would give to a cat.

542
00:44:45,999 --> 00:44:49,470
As a guest in your home
should not be more respected?

543
00:44:49,522 --> 00:44:51,920
We're totally changing
the subject.

544
00:44:51,972 --> 00:44:55,457
However, as this
seems to give satisfaction,

545
00:44:55,509 --> 00:44:58,479
please have the courage
to use the name in my presence.

546
00:44:58,531 --> 00:45:01,915
If you want Eusie,
so be it.

547
00:45:01,967 --> 00:45:04,145
Ladies!

548
00:45:15,696 --> 00:45:18,597
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

549
00:45:20,734 --> 00:45:23,103
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

550
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:25,520
It's past seven!

551
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:28,598
Feel the smell of coffee?

552
00:45:33,046 --> 00:45:34,731
Betsie!

553
00:45:34,783 --> 00:45:36,334
Betsie...

554
00:45:36,386 --> 00:45:37,833
Good morning!

555
00:45:37,885 --> 00:45:41,369
- What?
- Today is day 18!

556
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:45,790
- Birthday Dad and Mom!
- Oh, no!

557
00:45:46,059 --> 00:45:49,377
54 coupons for sweets.

558
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:53,024
Tell Mr. Klassen
what's for Dad.

559
00:45:54,768 --> 00:45:56,702
Corrie...

560
00:46:00,607 --> 00:46:04,645
Corrie...
that blouse and skirt...

561
00:46:04,697 --> 00:46:07,281
You should not use. Not today.

562
00:46:07,333 --> 00:46:08,430
But...

563
00:46:08,482 --> 00:46:10,918
You'd look like a flag
Stretched on a mast.

564
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:12,834
But you always
like this blouse.

565
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:15,704
The blouse is beautiful and you're beautiful

566
00:46:15,756 --> 00:46:20,160
But the combination of you,
the blouse and skirt...

567
00:46:20,212 --> 00:46:22,754
is impossible.

568
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:36,471
<i>Santa Fluc</i>

569
00:46:36,523 --> 00:46:41,737
<i>Santa Fluc</i>

570
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,954
Pope Ten Boom, you
is an extraordinary man.

571
00:46:53,026 --> 00:46:55,911
To a great man...

572
00:46:55,963 --> 00:46:59,865
there must have been a great woman.

573
00:47:00,634 --> 00:47:04,671
Well, this is not
just a song...

574
00:47:04,723 --> 00:47:06,932
is a more...

575
00:47:06,984 --> 00:47:09,090
blessing.

576
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:13,579
It means
"May the Lord bless you,

577
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:17,146
and keep you,

578
00:47:17,317 --> 00:47:22,277
and to illuminate
His face upon you. "

579
00:47:50,484 --> 00:47:54,147
You want the whole
Haarlem you listen to?

580
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:57,553
I did not ask to be born Jewish.

581
00:47:57,724 --> 00:48:00,308
I'm tired of having to...

582
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:04,145
carry the burden of suffering
worldwide.

583
00:48:04,197 --> 00:48:07,267
Just because the name
my mother was... Stein.

584
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:12,420
Then you will be another Esau

585
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,777
selling his birthright
for a mess of pottage!

586
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:19,561
Do not want your
great Jewish heritage!

587
00:48:19,613 --> 00:48:24,778
I want nothing to do
with his Lord God Jehovah.

588
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:28,703
It is not easy

589
00:48:28,755 --> 00:48:32,782
be in the palm of the hand of God.

590
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,384
Betsie, answer the door.

591
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:45,997
- Betsie, go!
- Yes, yes I will.

592
00:48:55,282 --> 00:48:57,663
Yes, one moment!

593
00:48:57,715 --> 00:49:00,045
Is Mrs. Beukers.

594
00:49:00,954 --> 00:49:03,204
Betsie, are you insane?

595
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:06,360
The whole street can hear
Jews singing.

596
00:49:06,412 --> 00:49:08,692
Thank you.

How will I remember all this?

608
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:48,395
The way we were passing messages
in church.

609
00:50:17,964 --> 00:50:20,797
- Kik!
- Tia Corrie.

610
00:50:22,002 --> 00:50:24,838
All these numbers...
what they mean?

611
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:27,674
Different things,
general instructions.

612
00:50:27,726 --> 00:50:29,724
Instructions for what?

613
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:32,293
Well, there may be a pilot
lying around.

614
00:50:32,345 --> 00:50:35,148
The numbers may be
coordinates to the rescue...

615
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,318
or perhaps to explode
a Nazi supply train!

616
00:50:38,370 --> 00:50:40,153
Stuff like that.

617
00:50:40,205 --> 00:50:42,485
Sabotage?

618
00:50:43,356 --> 00:50:46,848
This means
blood on our hands.

619
00:50:51,665 --> 00:50:53,997
It is the Netherlands.

620
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:57,085
And it justified?

621
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,368
Lying, stealing, killing?

622
00:51:00,607 --> 00:51:04,157
Anything
to help the Netherlands is certain.

623
00:51:04,209 --> 00:51:07,707
I need the message, Tia Corrie
are waiting.

624
00:51:17,257 --> 00:51:20,920
As we become
when this is over?

625
00:52:26,593 --> 00:52:28,195
Mlle. Ten Boom?

626
00:52:28,247 --> 00:52:29,577
Yes!

627
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:32,496
I appreciate your promptness.

628
00:52:38,605 --> 00:52:41,041
Heard a lot about you.

629
00:52:41,093 --> 00:52:42,524
About their work.

630
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:46,603
- Actually it is the work of my father.
- I'm not talking about watches.

631
00:52:53,053 --> 00:52:55,385
His other work.

632
00:52:55,855 --> 00:52:58,391
You mean to children?

633
00:52:58,443 --> 00:53:00,927
We had to cancel classes.

634
00:53:00,979 --> 00:53:02,644
Mlle. Ten Boom,

635
00:53:02,696 --> 00:53:06,544
many of us who can not
express our feelings,

636
00:53:06,596 --> 00:53:10,392
greatly appreciate
the work they are doing.

637
00:53:14,174 --> 00:53:18,270
People call his house
"Hiding from God. "

638
00:53:22,315 --> 00:53:25,400
Is this some kind of trap?

639
00:53:25,452 --> 00:53:29,137
Use the name of the Lord
is not correct.

640
00:53:29,189 --> 00:53:33,956
If it was a trap, would be
another room, talking to the Gestapo.

641
00:53:34,027 --> 00:53:36,711
This will not leave.

642
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:39,994
So why did you call me here?

643
00:53:41,901 --> 00:53:44,199
I want you...

644
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:50,833
pass the name of this man
to your friends.

645
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:57,447
Who is he?

646
00:53:58,618 --> 00:54:01,143
An entrepreneur.

647
00:54:01,788 --> 00:54:05,451
He denounces people
to the Gestapo.

648
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:09,959
He receives 75 florins per head.

649
00:54:11,631 --> 00:54:14,657
Just pass the name...

650
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:17,801
and they will take care of him.

651
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:26,740
If I did what you asked...

652
00:54:26,946 --> 00:54:30,712
would be to kill him
with my own hands.

653
00:54:31,751 --> 00:54:35,482
I can only put lo
Lord's hands,

654
00:54:35,822 --> 00:54:39,189
and ask Him
that reach your heart.

655
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,202
Do it, Miss. Ten Boom.

656
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:14,089
The demons are on the loose today.

657
00:55:19,332 --> 00:55:22,995
He thought he could sleep
with any noise.

658
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,338
Want some tea?

659
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:31,875
Thanks.

660
00:55:42,355 --> 00:55:44,557
You know, Miss. Ten Boom...

661
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:48,094
we are very similar.

662
00:55:48,146 --> 00:55:49,705
Stubborn...

663
00:55:49,757 --> 00:55:51,574
firm...

664
00:55:51,626 --> 00:55:53,391
determined.

665
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:57,558
Still not doing
their share of housework.

666
00:55:58,605 --> 00:56:00,673
We are equal, yes.

667
00:56:00,725 --> 00:56:03,115
But I'm more...

668
00:56:03,167 --> 00:56:05,506
then... I won!

669
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:11,910
Did you know...

670
00:56:12,519 --> 00:56:16,649
I have a wife and young son?

671
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:22,960
That's right.
Prefer not to expose myself.

672
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:26,530
They fled.

673
00:56:29,936 --> 00:56:34,066
At least...
I think it fled.

674
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:39,379
I will not run around
like the others,

675
00:56:39,431 --> 00:56:44,112
begging
compassion and safety.

676
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:47,387
We know so little of each other.

677
00:56:47,439 --> 00:56:51,639
You mind
with our needs.

678
00:56:51,691 --> 00:56:55,627
Certainly has
their own needs.

679
00:56:56,396 --> 00:57:00,715
People like us,
Mlle. Ten Boom...

680
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:05,363
have waves of fury
behind the stubbornness.

681
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:10,041
No rage.

682
00:57:11,744 --> 00:57:15,782
Could say my life
has been... monotonous.

683
00:57:15,834 --> 00:57:18,271
Until all this?

684
00:57:18,323 --> 00:57:20,709
Until all this.

685
00:57:21,221 --> 00:57:26,853
Marriage has never been considered
Ten Boom by sisters?

686
00:57:27,894 --> 00:57:30,863
Betsie had always
a delicate health.

687
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:33,833
She knew
could not have children,

688
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:37,234
then decided not to marry.

689
00:57:38,037 --> 00:57:40,403
And you?

690
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:46,239
I had a boyfriend,

691
00:57:48,414 --> 00:57:53,852
but I was not thin enough
for his family.

692
00:57:55,355 --> 00:57:58,222
I had no style.

693
00:58:00,026 --> 00:58:02,256
Still,

694
00:58:02,629 --> 00:58:08,033
I was the first woman to obtain
license to watch the Netherlands.

695
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:17,634
And you have your father,

696
00:58:18,144 --> 00:58:22,012
and his religion.

697
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:26,049
Is that enough?

698
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:28,482
More than enough.

699
00:58:28,821 --> 00:58:31,415
God has been good to me.

700
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:34,059
Yes, I...

701
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:36,327
I think so.

702
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:41,682
And I think...

703
00:58:41,734 --> 00:58:45,431
that already go to my bed.

704
00:58:47,073 --> 00:58:49,871
I will pray for your family.

705
00:58:54,213 --> 00:58:59,116
Do not think that will do me
peel potatoes, Miss. Ten Boom.

706
00:59:22,742 --> 00:59:24,493
Good morning.

707
00:59:24,545 --> 00:59:26,245
Mlle. Ten Boom?

708
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:28,440
Yes?

709
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:31,947
My name is Vogel...
Jan Vogel.

710
00:59:32,518 --> 00:59:35,976
I came from far away
Ermelo.

711
00:59:42,528 --> 00:59:46,294
It has a clock to fix?

712
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,496
I need 600 florins.

713
00:59:52,472 --> 00:59:55,737
I hear you have some contacts.

714
00:59:59,012 --> 01:00:01,446
I do not understand.

715
01:00:02,515 --> 01:00:05,075
It is my wife...

716
01:00:07,487 --> 01:00:10,118
she was arrested.

717
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:12,750
She is Jewish.

718
01:00:16,329 --> 01:00:18,957
It's a lot of money.

719
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:24,434
There's a cop who goes
arrange everything for 600 Fl...

720
01:00:25,104 --> 01:00:28,562
and then she will need
a place to hide.

721
01:00:35,915 --> 01:00:38,042
What?

722
01:00:41,854 --> 01:00:44,891
Somebody come and get it
within an hour.

723
01:00:44,943 --> 01:00:48,190
Mr. Jan Vogel.

724
01:00:48,327 --> 01:00:50,989
He is from Ermelo.

725
01:00:51,597 --> 01:00:54,133
His wife was arrested.

726
01:00:54,185 --> 01:00:56,795
It's for a bribe.

727
01:00:57,370 --> 01:00:59,772
You're impossible.

728
01:00:59,824 --> 01:01:02,123
Listen here...

729
01:01:02,175 --> 01:01:06,145
I'll handle it.
You can go to bed please?

730
01:01:06,197 --> 01:01:08,062
But Willem and Tine are coming.

731
01:01:08,114 --> 01:01:10,883
- You can go down later.
- So you call me.

732
01:01:10,935 --> 01:01:12,266
I'll call.

733
01:01:12,318 --> 01:01:15,776
- And use the steam kettle!
- Yes, yes.

734
01:01:39,545 --> 01:01:45,916
I feel that today the Lord wants
we read Romans chapter 8.

735
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:52,186
Who shall separate us
the love of Christ?

736
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:57,697
Shall tribulation, or distress,
or persecution or famine

737
01:01:57,749 --> 01:02:02,761
or nakedness, or peril,
or sword?

738
01:02:02,813 --> 01:02:07,774
This means that God
abandoned us? No!

739
01:02:07,826 --> 01:02:09,657
In all these things, however,

740
01:02:09,709 --> 01:02:14,130
are more than conquerors
through Christ who loved us.

741
01:02:14,182 --> 01:02:18,551
Because I am convinced that
neither death nor life...

742
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:22,247
nor angels, nor principalities...

743
01:02:22,299 --> 01:02:25,892
can separate us from the love of God.

744
01:02:25,944 --> 01:02:29,384
Nor things present...

745
01:02:30,530 --> 01:02:35,433
nor things to come, nor powers...

746
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:49,042
nor any other creature
can separate us...

747
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:51,947
Side door.

748
01:02:51,999 --> 01:02:54,045
Come on.

749
01:03:04,497 --> 01:03:07,022
All upstairs!

750
01:03:17,677 --> 01:03:19,736
Corrie!

751
01:03:29,188 --> 01:03:32,506
Yes, I am sorry, but we
closed until 2 am.

752
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:36,696
Mlle. Ten Boom...
marked time with his sister.

753
01:03:36,748 --> 01:03:38,579
Mr. Vogel?

754
01:03:38,631 --> 01:03:41,623
I need the money now!

755
01:03:43,102 --> 01:03:46,799
- Yes, of course, I'll pick him up.
- Please! Mlle. Ten Boom!

756
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:50,658
- On your marks, everyone!
- Come, quick!

757
01:03:50,710 --> 01:03:54,976
- Please, Miss. Ten Boom.
- Yes, just a moment!

758
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:57,345
I'm taking the money.

759
01:04:07,193 --> 01:04:11,061
Stay here, I see up there!

760
01:04:12,865 --> 01:04:14,481
Mlle. Ten Boom?

761
01:04:14,533 --> 01:04:17,661
Ten Boom, Elizabeth.

762
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,914
Where do you hide your
ration coupons?

763
01:04:27,966 --> 01:04:30,197
I do not know what you mean.

764
01:04:30,249 --> 01:04:33,619
- Where are the Jews?
- What Jews?

765
01:04:33,671 --> 01:04:36,452
O Lord Jesus, help me!

766
01:04:42,728 --> 01:04:45,212
Where are the Jews?

767
01:04:45,264 --> 01:04:48,256
Where is the secret room?

768
01:05:00,079 --> 01:05:02,138
Corrie!

769
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,809
Stop it!

770
01:05:08,387 --> 01:05:12,041
We did nothing
wrong in this house.

771
01:05:12,093 --> 01:05:15,695
So why are all these
ration coupons?

772
01:05:15,747 --> 01:05:18,220
To feed an army?

773
01:05:19,198 --> 01:05:24,170
What does your book
about obeying authority?

774
01:05:24,222 --> 01:05:26,620
There is a moment...

775
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:31,837
where we choose
between God and man.

776
01:06:22,795 --> 01:06:25,059
Keep walking.

777
01:06:34,874 --> 01:06:38,024
- Name?
- Cornelia.

778
01:06:38,076 --> 01:06:41,174
Ten Boom, Elizabeth.

779
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:45,644
- Name?
- Ten Boom, Casper.

780
01:07:09,108 --> 01:07:11,338
Papa!

781
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:15,240
Only six?

782
01:07:15,381 --> 01:07:17,064
Seven.

783
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,880
God is with us.

784
01:07:25,157 --> 01:07:27,250
Ten Boom...

785
01:07:28,861 --> 01:07:32,513
Give me your word
that will behave,

786
01:07:32,565 --> 01:07:37,935
and may die in peace
in his bed at his home.

787
01:07:38,070 --> 01:07:40,354
If I get back,

788
01:07:40,406 --> 01:07:43,391
open the door to anyone...

789
01:07:43,443 --> 01:07:46,377
beat that asking for help.

790
01:07:47,847 --> 01:07:50,145
May close.

791
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:02,316
Sealing the house.

792
01:09:48,968 --> 01:09:52,199
Out! Out! Out!

793
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:07,668
Corrie, hold my hand.

794
01:10:07,720 --> 01:10:11,986
- My sister needs a doctor.
- Move!

795
01:10:13,125 --> 01:10:17,311
Papa!

796
01:10:17,363 --> 01:10:20,261
God be with you, Daddy!

797
01:10:20,313 --> 01:10:23,160
And you, my children!

798
01:10:45,224 --> 01:10:47,818
I have to go in there.

799
01:11:03,609 --> 01:11:05,711
The fever dropped?

800
01:11:05,763 --> 01:11:07,813
You left them worried.

801
01:11:07,865 --> 01:11:10,077
Typhus.

802
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:14,801
I kept a loaf of yesterday
for you.

803
01:11:14,853 --> 01:11:19,091
Listen, I have family here.
My sister, my brother,

804
01:11:19,143 --> 01:11:21,360
My father, my nephew,
Ten Boom family.

805
01:11:21,412 --> 01:11:23,462
You can find out where they are?

806
01:11:23,514 --> 01:11:25,312
Perhaps, listen...

807
01:11:25,364 --> 01:11:28,515
Can I get soap,
aspirin, cigarettes.

808
01:11:28,567 --> 01:11:31,270
You can pay me when
begin to receive letters.

809
01:11:31,322 --> 01:11:33,620
Soap, 25 Fl, Aspirin, 50.

810
01:11:33,672 --> 01:11:36,442
Cigarettes, 100.
I can almost everything!

811
01:11:36,494 --> 01:11:39,343
You can get a Bible?

812
01:12:50,649 --> 01:12:53,618
Kik It! They can leave now.

813
01:12:57,656 --> 01:13:00,147
Oh, thank God!

814
01:13:05,097 --> 01:13:07,827
For the roof, quickly.

815
01:13:08,167 --> 01:13:10,250
The roof!

816
01:13:10,302 --> 01:13:13,794
- Where is your family?
- Fast!

817
01:13:15,607 --> 01:13:18,710
- And Ten Boom?
- Still in prison.

818
01:13:18,762 --> 01:13:21,428
That's all I know.

819
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:25,217
My mother made the quilt
my bed...

820
01:13:25,269 --> 01:13:28,744
was his outfit.

821
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:32,880
The table-side mirror is...

822
01:13:46,872 --> 01:13:49,363
Do not go away!

823
01:13:51,009 --> 01:13:52,958
Stay...

824
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:54,908
please.

825
01:14:01,820 --> 01:14:05,312
They think they have
to give you food.

826
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,674
- All have been released.
- All?

827
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:11,463
Except her sister Betsie
and his father, I think.

828
01:14:11,515 --> 01:14:13,999
- Not sure.
- Oh, thank you, Lord!

829
01:14:14,051 --> 01:14:15,916
O Lord, thank you!

830
01:14:15,968 --> 01:14:21,167
Here is a bread bakery
guards... is cool!

831
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:29,863
Oh Lord...

832
01:14:29,915 --> 01:14:32,999
You have done wonders.

833
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:36,077
I do not deserve
a little credit?

834
01:14:36,288 --> 01:14:39,223
Lord, bless this angel.

835
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:42,020
God bless you!

836
01:14:44,363 --> 01:14:49,301
You think you can last here
doing this? Praying?

837
01:14:49,353 --> 01:14:53,362
The only way to live here...
is hating.

838
01:14:55,641 --> 01:14:59,011
Hate can put it into
a prison worse than this.

839
01:14:59,063 --> 01:15:02,362
I am 3 years into this hole.

840
01:15:02,414 --> 01:15:05,131
It was difficult to get
this position.

841
01:15:05,183 --> 01:15:10,246
And I live for revenge
Pigs who betrayed me.

842
01:15:12,558 --> 01:15:15,789
You owe me 75 guilders!

843
01:16:39,111 --> 01:16:41,161
Are you cold?

844
01:16:41,213 --> 01:16:44,583
For me it is very pleasant.

845
01:16:44,635 --> 01:16:46,346
Sorry.

846
01:16:46,918 --> 01:16:51,378
Here for violation
the rules of rationing.

847
01:16:51,556 --> 01:16:57,188
Care to say where he got
these extra coupons?

848
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:00,832
Sometimes
they just appeared.

849
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:04,199
Like so... appeared?

850
01:17:04,269 --> 01:17:06,553
Were tucked under the door.

851
01:17:06,605 --> 01:17:09,841
Other times I have been
market data.

852
01:17:09,893 --> 01:17:12,125
By whom?

853
01:17:12,177 --> 01:17:16,341
- A Mr. Smit.
- Mr. Jan Smit?

854
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:22,513
Can you tell me
about their activities?

855
01:17:25,590 --> 01:17:29,094
My sister and I
we took classes on the Bible

856
01:17:29,146 --> 01:17:32,530
until these classes
were banned.

857
01:17:32,864 --> 01:17:36,568
And we worked
with exceptional children.

858
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:39,230
- How?
- Like what?

859
01:17:39,282 --> 01:17:41,788
As they worked with?

860
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:44,866
We taught them about God.

861
01:17:45,143 --> 01:17:46,893
What a waste!

862
01:17:46,945 --> 01:17:49,095
If you want to convert,

863
01:17:49,147 --> 01:17:54,278
certainly worth a normal person
delayed more than all the world.

864
01:17:55,454 --> 01:18:00,425
In the eyes of God,
a child may be worth more than...

865
01:18:00,477 --> 01:18:03,394
The daughter of a watchmaker.

866
01:18:04,296 --> 01:18:06,560
Maybe...

867
01:18:07,532 --> 01:18:11,036
but I know that He is always
watching over me.

868
01:18:11,088 --> 01:18:13,219
You really believe that?

869
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:17,970
I believe that He is looking
for you too, Lieutenant.

870
01:18:23,215 --> 01:18:27,452
Tell me, Miss. Ten Boom,
how can one believe in God

871
01:18:27,504 --> 01:18:30,570
leaving an elderly man
die in prison?

872
01:18:30,622 --> 01:18:35,855
And your body be buried
in a common grave?

873
01:18:37,996 --> 01:18:40,396
My father?

874
01:18:41,566 --> 01:18:45,251
It seems that he was taken ill
after 10 days.

875
01:18:45,303 --> 01:18:47,806
He was taken to a hospital in The Hague,
but unfortunately...

876
01:18:47,858 --> 01:18:50,290
there were no beds.

877
01:18:50,342 --> 01:18:53,778
He apparently
died in the hallway.

878
01:18:54,012 --> 01:18:57,277
One type of administrative malfunction.

879
01:18:58,016 --> 01:19:01,820
In these circumstances,
nobody complains when the body...

880
01:19:01,872 --> 01:19:04,812
is difficult to know where you are.

881
01:19:06,558 --> 01:19:10,790
I know where my father is,
Lieutenant.

882
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:16,095
That's all,
Mlle. Ten Boom.

883
01:19:21,706 --> 01:19:24,573
Do you have news from home.

884
01:19:57,475 --> 01:20:00,842
ALL WATCHES SAFE

885
01:20:07,886 --> 01:20:09,979
Pope...

886
01:20:11,389 --> 01:20:13,619
Pope...

887
01:20:48,126 --> 01:20:53,086
28 FEBRUARY
PRISON

888
01:20:54,132 --> 01:20:59,092
MARCH 9
DEATH OF FATHER

889
01:22:30,628 --> 01:22:33,313
Betsie!

890
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:35,999
Corrie!

891
01:22:38,003 --> 01:22:39,704
It's my sister!

892
01:22:39,756 --> 01:22:43,634
Betsie!

893
01:22:50,348 --> 01:22:54,578
Betsie!

894
01:22:55,153 --> 01:22:57,485
Betsie!

895
01:22:58,323 --> 01:23:01,156
- Betsie!
- Corrie!

896
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:45,041
Ravensbruck!
Oh my God!

897
01:27:14,512 --> 01:27:18,149
<i>You may not save
any personal belonging.</i>

898
01:27:18,201 --> 01:27:21,160
<i>There are no exceptions.</i>

899
01:27:21,212 --> 01:27:24,119
<i>Take off your clothes...</i>

900
01:27:33,698 --> 01:27:36,083
I can not!
They are taking everything!

901
01:27:36,135 --> 01:27:38,469
What He asked us,
It will help us do.

902
01:27:38,521 --> 01:27:42,132
Want to die
because of a coat?

903
01:27:42,473 --> 01:27:44,709
<i>- I can not.
- There will be no exceptions.</i>

904
01:27:44,761 --> 01:27:46,444
- Where do they go?
- Bathrooms, please!

905
01:27:46,496 --> 01:27:50,005
For showers,
use drains.

906
01:27:50,515 --> 01:27:53,916
Please understand,
she is very ill.

907
01:27:54,585 --> 01:27:57,734
- Name?
- Bridget Marie.

908
01:27:57,786 --> 01:28:00,884
- Name?
- Priest, Frances.

909
01:28:05,463 --> 01:28:08,591
Quick, take off your coat.

910
01:28:09,801 --> 01:28:11,826
Quick!

911
01:28:13,771 --> 01:28:17,229
Will send us back here
after bathing.

912
01:28:22,113 --> 01:28:24,604
Yes, yes you can.
Quick!

913
01:28:26,217 --> 01:28:28,412
Thank you!

914
01:29:10,561 --> 01:29:13,257
I found my shoes!

915
01:29:18,503 --> 01:29:21,105
How much does an underwear?

916
01:29:21,157 --> 01:29:23,801
The loaves a week.

917
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,097
<i>Next</i>

918
01:29:31,149 --> 01:29:36,319
O Lord, You have given your word
and hid everywhere!

919
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:41,490
Now open a way for us
pass through the gates of hell.

920
01:29:44,862 --> 01:29:47,729
You are in God's hands now.

921
01:29:49,267 --> 01:29:50,816

922
01:29:50,868 --> 01:29:53,638

Classification?

936
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:13,183
Ten Boom, here!

937
01:31:23,327 --> 01:31:25,391
Fleas!

938
01:31:25,443 --> 01:31:27,456
Lice.

939
01:31:31,636 --> 01:31:35,265
Can you imagine
what Mom would say?

940
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:42,561
Ravensbruck...

941
01:31:42,613 --> 01:31:46,049
is not a holiday camp.

942
01:31:48,853 --> 01:31:52,256
Call at 4:30 every morning.

943
01:31:52,308 --> 01:31:55,225
7 days a week.

944
01:31:57,161 --> 01:32:00,961
Tomorrow, distribution of tasks.

945
01:32:01,165 --> 01:32:05,761
Those who can not work,
submit to the ward...

946
01:32:05,903 --> 01:32:09,566
and is better than
patients are the same!

947
01:32:10,308 --> 01:32:13,044
You will receive
200 grams of bread...

948
01:32:13,096 --> 01:32:16,810
and a pint of soup per day.

949
01:32:17,048 --> 01:32:21,747
A small observation
which their lives depend on...

950
01:32:22,053 --> 01:32:25,623
There is only one way
to freedom.

951
01:32:25,675 --> 01:32:27,921
Work!

952
01:32:36,367 --> 01:32:40,597
Raise it!

953
01:33:46,370 --> 01:33:48,736
Are you Dutch?

954
01:33:50,141 --> 01:33:53,338
I have relatives Dutch.

955
01:33:55,846 --> 01:33:58,576
From her mother.

956
01:33:59,316 --> 01:34:03,002
You are not the only
surprise to be here.

957
01:34:03,054 --> 01:34:07,457
I figured it would work in
redistribution center...

958
01:34:08,092 --> 01:34:10,185
refugees.

959
01:34:22,573 --> 01:34:25,709
Supplies are very limited.

960
01:34:25,761 --> 01:34:28,794
A listing needs is essential.

961
01:34:28,846 --> 01:34:33,647
I know very well the hospitals,
I've been kind of a nurse.

962
01:34:34,085 --> 01:34:37,121
That must be why
that you sent here.

963
01:34:37,173 --> 01:34:38,570
I was a midwife.

964
01:34:38,622 --> 01:34:42,285
I helped bring Jewish babies
the world.

965
01:34:46,030 --> 01:34:49,133
Never touch anything here.

966
01:34:49,185 --> 01:34:52,236
Soap, vitamins, analgesics...

967
01:34:52,288 --> 01:34:54,864
yeast, quinine.

968
01:34:57,608 --> 01:35:01,339
I have the only key
this cabinet.

969
01:35:02,513 --> 01:35:04,096
However...

970
01:35:04,148 --> 01:35:08,881
will realize that sometimes
forget to lock him up.

971
01:35:10,755 --> 01:35:12,990
I hope you understand...

972
01:35:13,042 --> 01:35:15,982
...66685.

973
01:36:11,549 --> 01:36:14,177
Thank you, Lord!

974
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:21,091
He does not expect
thanks for this.

975
01:36:21,143 --> 01:36:23,525
It's hot!

976
01:36:23,727 --> 01:36:28,027
I am grateful for every moment
we have together.

977
01:36:28,999 --> 01:36:32,560
We can at least sleep together.

978
01:36:35,739 --> 01:36:38,731
There must be a plan, Corrie.

979
01:36:42,346 --> 01:36:46,612
There'll be grateful for lice.

980
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:52,485
God makes no mistakes.

981
01:36:55,626 --> 01:36:57,543
How are you doing in hospital?

982
01:36:57,595 --> 01:37:02,099
True, it has to be with
more than 40 degrees to be admitted?

983
01:37:02,151 --> 01:37:03,982
That's the rule.

984
01:37:04,034 --> 01:37:07,671
There is a guard in the laundry
that sells underwear.

985
01:37:07,723 --> 01:37:09,588
- In exchange for what?
- Rations of bread.

986
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:15,010
- Do not cut too!
- What you want, or hair lice?

987
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,697
Will learn
to love these creatures.

988
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:21,919
The guards will not come close
this nest of lice.

989
01:37:21,971 --> 01:37:25,616
Door inside...
We can do everything.

990
01:37:26,423 --> 01:37:29,085
Even lice!

991
01:38:07,264 --> 01:38:09,789
6-6-7-2-7.

992
01:38:12,836 --> 01:38:15,270
6-6-7-2-7!

993
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:20,303
6-6-7-2-7 is not here!

994
01:38:29,453 --> 01:38:31,546
Here!

995
01:38:45,970 --> 01:38:48,105
Someone lost time.

996
01:38:48,157 --> 01:38:50,539
The mad.

997
01:38:52,743 --> 01:38:55,234
Ah, Corrie...

998
01:38:55,479 --> 01:38:58,312
We are in hell!

999
01:39:23,140 --> 01:39:25,943
Why keep us here
so long?

1000
01:39:25,995 --> 01:39:28,503
To fall apart.

1001
01:39:30,914 --> 01:39:33,280
Betsie, look!

1002
01:39:43,527 --> 01:39:47,156
She was sure that nobody died,

1003
01:39:47,664 --> 01:39:50,758
we all go back home.

1004
01:39:51,735 --> 01:39:54,720
In those days the train,

1005
01:39:54,772 --> 01:39:58,105
the Lord seemed to have promised.

1006
01:40:01,045 --> 01:40:05,414
How did I misunderstand?

1007
01:40:07,551 --> 01:40:12,147
O dear Father, help me.

1008
01:40:12,689 --> 01:40:17,456
Do not let me hear my voice
and think that it's Your!

1009
01:40:21,331 --> 01:40:23,281
Oh, Jesus...

1010
01:40:23,333 --> 01:40:27,394
Show me how to live in this place.

1011
01:40:32,176 --> 01:40:35,145
You also love Him?

1012
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:39,659
Put it in the mattress.

1013
01:41:39,711 --> 01:41:42,727
Not now! It's yeast,

1014
01:41:42,779 --> 01:41:48,240
and not spread around.
I can not get to everyone...

1015
01:41:57,227 --> 01:42:01,615
This method was to paint
blips

1016
01:42:01,667 --> 01:42:05,951
of pure colors on the screen.

1017
01:42:06,003 --> 01:42:09,221
And the mix of colors was done...

1018
01:42:09,273 --> 01:42:13,677
to paint dots of different colors
alongside one another.

1019
01:42:13,729 --> 01:42:17,881
Then, at a distance, the two colors...

1020
01:42:17,933 --> 01:42:21,527
seemed blended in a new color.

1021
01:42:21,579 --> 01:42:25,122
Jesus Christ has enabled us...

1022
01:42:25,174 --> 01:42:29,786
have direct access.

1023
01:42:31,828 --> 01:42:37,061
- There is a repetition at this point.
- In the second movement?

1024
01:42:37,501 --> 01:42:42,461
There is a slowing
the end of the third bar.

1025
01:42:44,208 --> 01:42:50,247
<i>Ye soldiers of the cross
Raise her banner</i>

1026
01:42:50,299 --> 01:42:52,458
You're wrong,
the slowing is after.

1027
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:54,618
<i>He must not suffer loss</i>

1028
01:42:54,670 --> 01:42:57,951
Attention! Attention!

1029
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:08,797
NO SPACE!

1030
01:43:26,083 --> 01:43:28,950
Find space.

1031
01:43:47,271 --> 01:43:51,008
German prostitutes...
were examined at the hospital...

1032
01:43:51,060 --> 01:43:52,857
infected.

1033
01:43:52,909 --> 01:43:55,645
So that the yellow badge?

1034
01:43:55,697 --> 01:43:58,330
It's a shame to the class.

1035
01:43:58,382 --> 01:44:01,579
It was caught
worker with a Slavic.

1036
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:06,081
She is a child.

1037
01:44:20,771 --> 01:44:23,831
You stepped on my foot!

1038
01:44:42,059 --> 01:44:44,892
Do not push yourself too hard, countess.

1039
01:44:46,029 --> 01:44:48,813
That's all I can bear.

1040
01:44:48,865 --> 01:44:52,269
More than that
and I have to stop time.

1041
01:44:52,321 --> 01:44:54,931
I decide who to!

1042
01:45:07,317 --> 01:45:08,967
Betsie!

1043
01:45:09,019 --> 01:45:11,783
I decide who to!

1044
01:45:13,623 --> 01:45:15,591
No!

1045
01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:24,234
No hate, Corrie...

1046
01:45:24,286 --> 01:45:26,498
without hate.

1047
01:45:30,607 --> 01:45:35,943
- I want the hottest clothes.
- You owe me two days of bread!

1048
01:45:37,581 --> 01:45:39,816
I'll pay you next week.

1049
01:45:39,868 --> 01:45:41,977
No!

1050
01:45:46,156 --> 01:45:48,556
You idiot!

1051
01:45:53,063 --> 01:45:56,915
Jesus knows what we felt.

1052
01:45:56,967 --> 01:46:02,305
He promised that when two or three
gathered in His name,

1053
01:46:02,357 --> 01:46:05,331
He would be there...

1054
01:46:05,383 --> 01:46:08,306
even in Ravensbruck!

1055
01:46:10,046 --> 01:46:13,140
Before, in our lives,

1056
01:46:13,283 --> 01:46:18,050
would be separated from Him,
very distant.

1057
01:46:18,121 --> 01:46:23,260
But now the distance
separated us was eliminated.

1058
01:46:23,312 --> 01:46:26,803
And we can see the truth:

1059
01:46:26,855 --> 01:46:30,295
Jesus in each one of us.

1060
01:46:30,801 --> 01:46:33,964
Light in the darkness.

1061
01:46:36,139 --> 01:46:39,404
And we praise lo together.

1062
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:04,082
<i>Father..</i>

1063
01:47:04,134 --> 01:47:07,001
<i>blesses the German people</i>

1064
01:47:07,170 --> 01:47:10,290
<i>with your huge
stock of love.</i>

1065
01:47:10,342 --> 01:47:13,358
<i>Forgive them, for the love of Jesus.</i>

1066
01:47:13,410 --> 01:47:16,913
<i>not take into consideration
this place to judge them</i>

1067
01:47:16,965 --> 01:47:18,963
<i>Forgive them...</i>

1068
01:47:19,015 --> 01:47:22,644
<i>even before
know what to ask.</i>

1069
01:47:26,189 --> 01:47:28,091
Two days of bread.

1070
01:47:28,143 --> 01:47:29,941
I will pay only one.

1071
01:47:29,993 --> 01:47:33,611
Two... or else
not have the scarf!

1072
01:47:33,663 --> 01:47:39,124
- I give you one now and another tomorrow.
- I'll meet you.

1073
01:48:58,848 --> 01:49:01,715
We will now rub!

1074
01:49:03,219 --> 01:49:05,483
Rub!

1075
01:49:05,555 --> 01:49:09,292
A train full of Polish
arrived last night.

1076
01:49:09,344 --> 01:49:13,194
- Vulture.
- Same to you.

1077
01:49:15,899 --> 01:49:18,168
- I have a shirt.
- Look ahead!

1078
01:49:18,220 --> 01:49:20,818
- It's wool.
- No!

1079
01:49:20,870 --> 01:49:25,273
- Two days of bread.
- My comb.

1080
01:49:26,876 --> 01:49:30,812
I picked up later.
None of the comb.

1081
01:49:31,414 --> 01:49:33,905
Scrub hard!

1082
01:49:35,585 --> 01:49:38,383
- Rub.
- Thanks.

1083
01:49:47,263 --> 01:49:51,393
The sky is so quiet.

1084
01:49:54,771 --> 01:49:58,707
Political prisoners do not talk
with people like us...

1085
01:50:04,147 --> 01:50:06,775
We are all equal.

1086
01:50:11,755 --> 01:50:15,191
I grabbed a tray...
the ward.

1087
01:50:23,566 --> 01:50:26,126
Continue, continue!

1088
01:50:51,928 --> 01:50:55,091
I thought it was clever.

1089
01:50:59,469 --> 01:51:02,620
You drew attention
for you in the queue.

1090
01:51:02,672 --> 01:51:06,543
Imbecile! Could not wait
before returning to the shed?

1091
01:51:06,595 --> 01:51:09,145
It's just so greedy?

1092
01:51:09,197 --> 01:51:12,410
German bitch!

1093
01:51:13,483 --> 01:51:14,799
I should leave
that kill.

1094
01:51:14,851 --> 01:51:17,635
His great...
disgusting, worthless!

1095
01:51:17,687 --> 01:51:20,557
You may want to go alone,
no light, no water.

1096
01:51:20,609 --> 01:51:25,290
You'll never do
such idiocy!

1097
01:51:25,462 --> 01:51:27,521
Never!

1098
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:36,838
Now I...
I'll bandage his hand.

1099
01:51:46,583 --> 01:51:50,954
"Comfort the feebleminded,
support the weak,

1100
01:51:51,006 --> 01:51:54,072
and be patient with everyone.

1101
01:51:54,124 --> 01:51:57,427
Behold that nobody
repay evil for evil;

1102
01:51:57,479 --> 01:52:00,997
always make good
to each other.

1103
01:52:01,049 --> 01:52:03,625
Rejoice evermore.

1104
01:52:03,677 --> 01:52:06,150
Pray without ceasing,

1105
01:52:06,202 --> 01:52:11,333
in everything give thanks;

1106
01:52:11,841 --> 01:52:15,745
because this is the will
of God in Christ Jesus. "

1107
01:52:15,797 --> 01:52:20,283
For fools
the words seem comforting.

1108
01:52:20,335 --> 01:52:23,741
This place is mockery!

1109
01:52:26,689 --> 01:52:30,159
God did not make this place...
men did!

1110
01:52:30,211 --> 01:52:33,630
But he has power.
Certainly could stop los.

1111
01:52:33,682 --> 01:52:35,899
Unless, of course,
that is a sadist.

1112
01:52:35,951 --> 01:52:38,802
No! He is love, only love.

1113
01:52:38,854 --> 01:52:40,818
Then he is impotent.

1114
01:52:40,870 --> 01:52:43,873
It can not be both,
my dear!

1115
01:52:43,925 --> 01:52:46,824
You see what is
around them.

1116
01:52:46,876 --> 01:52:50,580
We see another world,
as real as this:

1117
01:52:50,632 --> 01:52:53,242
Our life with God.

1118
01:52:53,683 --> 01:52:55,500
Every day...

1119
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:59,318
it gets deeper and stronger.

1120
01:52:59,489 --> 01:53:04,594
You think the two can not exist
side by side, but we know they can!

1121
01:53:04,646 --> 01:53:07,495
We live them both!

1122
01:53:08,064 --> 01:53:11,201
Enough to know that we
a lot of manure,

1123
01:53:11,253 --> 01:53:14,179
going from nothing to nothing.

1124
01:53:14,231 --> 01:53:17,054
But you should know
your God

1125
01:53:17,106 --> 01:53:20,710
feel the stench
coming out of these chimneys

1126
01:53:20,762 --> 01:53:24,476
and refuses to do something!

1127
01:53:26,716 --> 01:53:29,184
If only...

1128
01:53:29,252 --> 01:53:32,346
you know his love...

1129
01:53:34,457 --> 01:53:37,654
I am Mary Wrochek...

1130
01:53:38,528 --> 01:53:43,465
First violinist
Warsaw Symphony Orchestra.

1131
01:53:43,600 --> 01:53:47,764
Your God wanted it?

1132
01:53:58,481 --> 01:54:01,109
We have no answers.

1133
01:54:01,818 --> 01:54:07,123
I can only say that the same God
who is accusing

1134
01:54:07,175 --> 01:54:11,317
came and lived
here in our world.

1135
01:54:11,369 --> 01:54:15,459
He was beaten...
was humiliated...

1136
01:54:15,765 --> 01:54:18,791
and died on a cross.

1137
01:54:19,135 --> 01:54:21,729
He did it for love...

1138
01:54:22,338 --> 01:54:24,155
for us.

1139
01:54:24,207 --> 01:54:26,224
And why do you think...

1140
01:54:26,276 --> 01:54:30,542
that your loving God
sent it here?

1141
01:54:36,119 --> 01:54:38,587
To obey lo.

1142
01:54:39,789 --> 01:54:42,373
If you know it

1143
01:54:42,425 --> 01:54:45,485
not need to know why.

1144
01:54:48,197 --> 01:54:50,950
First squeeze oranges 4,

1145
01:54:51,002 --> 01:54:53,270
and put a dash of cream

1146
01:54:53,322 --> 01:54:55,486
and a cup of sugar.

1147
01:54:55,538 --> 01:54:58,155
I only use 3/4 cup of.

1148
01:54:58,207 --> 01:55:00,758
You must use the whole cup.

1149
01:55:00,810 --> 01:55:05,615
You then put the peels aside
grating, and beat the cream.

1150
01:55:05,667 --> 01:55:09,752
What kind of cook are you?
Forget the eggs.

1151
01:55:09,804 --> 01:55:12,653
Make your own recipe, then.

1152
01:55:18,127 --> 01:55:20,459
We need more sand.

1153
01:55:26,669 --> 01:55:28,796
Corrie...

1154
01:55:31,140 --> 01:55:33,124
Corrie...

1155
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:36,839
do not ignore me... please.

1156
01:55:40,383 --> 01:55:43,219
You know you can only
leave in the hands of Jesus.

1157
01:55:43,271 --> 01:55:45,588
Think not that I have prayed?

1158
01:55:45,640 --> 01:55:47,638
But I hate them.

1159
01:55:47,690 --> 01:55:51,091
All Nazi hate this place!

1160
01:55:51,527 --> 01:55:54,963
We can not be
more than we are.

1161
01:55:56,699 --> 01:55:59,936
Only Jesus can free us
of ourselves

1162
01:55:59,988 --> 01:56:03,030
what happens.

1163
01:56:03,373 --> 01:56:07,243
Sister...
You can not protect me.

1164
01:56:07,295 --> 01:56:10,076
You should not try.

1165
01:56:37,640 --> 01:56:39,904
Lord,

1166
01:56:41,944 --> 01:56:45,903
I can not shake it.

1167
01:56:49,252 --> 01:56:51,552
Get this...

1168
01:56:51,604 --> 01:56:53,853
hate...

1169
01:56:54,157 --> 01:56:56,785
of my life...

1170
01:56:59,262 --> 01:57:02,663
Your love and put in place.

1171
01:57:07,870 --> 01:57:09,854
Jesus,

1172
01:57:09,906 --> 01:57:13,501
there are so many things
I do not understand.

1173
01:57:17,246 --> 01:57:19,976
Do not let me go crazy...

1174
01:57:21,984 --> 01:57:25,112
followed by myself.

1175
01:57:27,457 --> 01:57:30,290
You know how I am.

1176
01:57:35,531 --> 01:57:37,795
Salvador...

1177
01:57:41,771 --> 01:57:45,434
keep me in the center
Thy will.

1178
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:06,025
How long?

1179
01:58:08,364 --> 01:58:10,662
Four months.

1180
01:58:11,100 --> 01:58:13,298
And you with it?

1181
01:58:13,350 --> 01:58:15,497
Daughter...

1182
01:58:16,172 --> 01:58:19,275
You want to see me cry,
is not it?

1183
01:58:19,327 --> 01:58:22,369
To play a mother to me.

1184
01:58:22,912 --> 01:58:24,562
I just want to help.

1185
01:58:24,614 --> 01:58:29,950
What difference would it make?
Everything dies here.

1186
01:58:34,657 --> 01:58:37,374
Damn! That nasty whore!

1187
01:58:37,426 --> 01:58:40,263
We need vitamins
cálcio and all you get.

1188
01:58:40,315 --> 01:58:42,546
You're too naive.

1189
01:58:42,598 --> 01:58:45,067
In her two anois
hit him with a whip!

1190
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:47,629
It's a baby, Katje,
a new life!

1191
01:58:47,681 --> 01:58:50,087
I'm not your nurse
Red Cross!

1192
01:58:50,139 --> 01:58:54,735
I'll never get enough
for you, she and Betsie too!

1193
01:59:07,990 --> 01:59:10,126
- What are you doing?
- Nothing! I was just...

1194
01:59:10,178 --> 01:59:13,118
I asked what are you doing?

1195
01:59:13,296 --> 01:59:16,999
We have a pregnancy at 28.
A girl of 18. She is...

1196
01:59:17,051 --> 01:59:19,250
I do not care!

1197
01:59:19,302 --> 01:59:23,602
All pregnant women are transferred
for the experimental ward.

1198
02:00:11,988 --> 02:00:16,425
Yeast, vitamin B
It will aid in digestion.

1199
02:00:16,477 --> 02:00:19,690
There have been a midwife.

1200
02:00:40,316 --> 02:00:45,720
<i>Usergroup 5, 100 women,
present themselves for inspection.</i>

1201
02:00:46,789 --> 02:00:49,707
<i>Prisoner 146723</i>

1202
02:00:49,759 --> 02:00:53,126
<i>submit to the administration
for processing.</i>

1203
02:01:05,474 --> 02:01:09,261
All this crap German
should be good for something.

1204
02:01:09,313 --> 02:01:12,997
German newspapers, thick
as head of the Germans!

1205
02:01:13,049 --> 02:01:17,986
There are rumors running! The Americans
are halfway to Reno.

1206
02:01:20,222 --> 02:01:21,839
Well..

1207
02:01:21,891 --> 02:01:27,420
We will protect it from cold winds.

1208
02:01:28,397 --> 02:01:30,991
Katje, thanks!

1209
02:01:35,771 --> 02:01:38,290
You two are funny.

1210
02:01:38,342 --> 02:01:40,476
Well.. Tell us...

1211
02:01:40,528 --> 02:01:42,559
We need to laugh!

1212
02:01:42,611 --> 02:01:45,697
They are always talking about love.

1213
02:01:45,749 --> 02:01:48,784
I bet none of the two
was a man.

1214
02:01:54,123 --> 02:01:56,785
We had boyfriends.

1215
02:02:01,964 --> 02:02:05,216
You loved the father of her baby?

1216
02:02:05,268 --> 02:02:08,469
I was hungry.
He was cool with me.

1217
02:02:25,554 --> 02:02:28,523
I feel so strange.

1218
02:02:30,760 --> 02:02:34,544
- I can not.
- Well, try it!

1219
02:02:34,596 --> 02:02:38,328
It seems wood.
I'm so weak!

1220
02:02:38,934 --> 02:02:42,238
Thankfully, God is strong.

1221
02:02:42,290 --> 02:02:45,230
Katje, Katje!

1222
02:03:59,715 --> 02:04:03,776
Betsie, try...
please try.

1223
02:04:06,055 --> 02:04:08,580
Corrie knows,

1224
02:04:10,092 --> 02:04:13,118
will be released!

1225
02:04:13,462 --> 02:04:16,365
Before the new year.

1226
02:04:16,417 --> 02:04:18,697
We two.

1227
02:04:19,368 --> 02:04:21,700
We two?

1228
02:04:22,037 --> 02:04:23,588
The Lord...

1229
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:25,556
showed me...

1230
02:04:25,608 --> 02:04:27,472
a dream.

1231
02:04:28,043 --> 02:04:30,409
You'll see!

1232
02:04:34,350 --> 02:04:38,218
- I will not die, Corrie.
- No.

1233
02:04:55,971 --> 02:04:57,589
Enough already.

1234
02:04:57,641 --> 02:04:59,156
Leave it there.

1235
02:04:59,208 --> 02:05:01,191
- Please.
- Let her!

1236
02:05:01,243 --> 02:05:05,543
All prisoners
present themselves in the courtyard.

1237
02:05:21,163 --> 02:05:25,065
- Please let me stay with her.
- Go for the call!

1238
02:05:51,627 --> 02:05:55,188
<i>Block 41... dismissed.</i>

1239
02:05:58,267 --> 02:06:01,634
<i>Block 28... dismissed.</i>

1240
02:06:03,672 --> 02:06:07,039
<i>Block 33... dismissed.</i>

1241
02:06:09,345 --> 02:06:12,837
<i>Block 35... dismissed.</i>

1242
02:06:19,321 --> 02:06:20,704
Betsie!

1243
02:06:20,756 --> 02:06:24,141
The prisoner is being
transferred to the hospital.

1244
02:06:24,193 --> 02:06:29,358
Prisoner 66730 requests permission
to accompany her sister.

1245
02:06:29,732 --> 02:06:31,615
What's the score?

1246
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:35,383
Block 20: 4 dead.
Block 21: 3 dead.

1247
02:06:35,435 --> 02:06:39,099
- Block 22: 6 dead.
- You can go.

1248
02:06:39,174 --> 02:06:43,278
- Block 23: None.
- Must have more. Count again.

1249
02:06:43,330 --> 02:06:45,287
Betsie!

1250
02:06:45,339 --> 02:06:47,244
Sister!

1251
02:06:49,785 --> 02:06:52,583
Thank Him, Corrie.

1252
02:06:52,921 --> 02:06:54,504
Thank the Lord...

1253
02:06:54,556 --> 02:06:58,260
- For all He has done for us here.
- You will get better soon.

1254
02:06:58,312 --> 02:07:00,455
Together...

1255
02:07:00,596 --> 02:07:02,895
you and me...

1256
02:07:02,947 --> 02:07:05,195
Always together.

1257
02:07:50,245 --> 02:07:52,304
Water.

1258
02:08:55,778 --> 02:08:59,448
Can I sleep here?
Just this evening?

1259
02:08:59,500 --> 02:09:01,331
It's too cold.

1260
02:09:01,383 --> 02:09:04,875
So we have two blankets.

1261
02:09:20,936 --> 02:09:25,600
If God so loved the Betsie...

1262
02:09:25,974 --> 02:09:28,135
Why?

1263
02:09:34,383 --> 02:09:39,719
Suffering does not mean that
God stopped loving us.

1264
02:09:42,257 --> 02:09:44,341
Sometimes...

1265
02:09:44,393 --> 02:09:49,763
we have to accept things
we do not understand.

1266
02:09:50,399 --> 02:09:53,165
I love Betsie...

1267
02:09:53,217 --> 02:09:55,932
and I love you!

1268
02:11:54,656 --> 02:11:57,648
This is his sister.

1269
02:12:18,814 --> 02:12:22,617
Corrie, you should look...

1270
02:12:22,669 --> 02:12:25,609
otherwise never know.

1271
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:54,610
She is beautiful.

1272
02:13:08,196 --> 02:13:10,494
Betsie!

1273
02:13:38,560 --> 02:13:44,157
<i>We have to do many things
by others.</i>

1274
02:13:45,500 --> 02:13:49,027
<i>And we go everywhere.</i>

1275
02:13:50,272 --> 02:13:54,402
We tell people...

1276
02:13:56,578 --> 02:13:59,877
that no pit is so deep...

1277
02:14:01,116 --> 02:14:04,643
He can not reach.

1278
02:14:07,756 --> 02:14:10,748
They believe in us...

1279
02:14:12,127 --> 02:14:14,925
because we came here.

1280
02:14:15,464 --> 02:14:22,336
Betsie spoke about heaven
as already been there.

1281
02:14:24,406 --> 02:14:27,175
No one wanted to
she returned.

1282
02:14:27,227 --> 02:14:29,733
Read by Betsie.

1283
02:14:29,785 --> 02:14:32,240
Read all of us.

1284
02:14:46,428 --> 02:14:50,365
"For we know that
Our earthly bodies,

1285
02:14:50,417 --> 02:14:52,968
the ones we have now

1286
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:55,485
which will die,

1287
02:14:55,537 --> 02:15:00,736
must be transformed
in our heavenly bodies,

1288
02:15:01,143 --> 02:15:03,873
which will not die...

1289
02:15:04,012 --> 02:15:06,529
They will live forever.

1290
02:15:06,581 --> 02:15:10,532
Then the scripture will be fulfilled.

1291
02:15:10,584 --> 02:15:14,483
Where, O death, where is thy victory? "

1292
02:15:15,223 --> 02:15:18,283
<i>Therefore, my beloved brothers...</i>

1293
02:15:18,527 --> 02:15:22,657
<i>since future victory
is right,</i>

1294
02:15:22,797 --> 02:15:26,563
<i>stand firm
and unshakable.</i>

1295
02:15:26,701 --> 02:15:30,967
<i>Always give yourselves fully
the Lord's work,</i>

1296
02:15:32,073 --> 02:15:36,993
<i>because we know that, Sir,</i>

1297
02:15:37,045 --> 02:15:39,996
<i>our work will not be meaningless...</i>

1298
02:15:40,048 --> 02:15:44,644
<i>what if
there was no resurrection.</i>

1299
02:15:46,755 --> 02:15:49,806
<i>And this is good news,</i>

1300
02:15:49,858 --> 02:15:54,729
<i>that Christ died for our sins,
according to the scriptures.</i>

1301
02:15:54,781 --> 02:15:58,815
<i>resurrected,
as the prophets had said.</i>

1302
02:15:58,867 --> 02:16:04,739
<i>For God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten Son,</i>

1303
02:16:04,791 --> 02:16:09,802
<i>that whosoever believeth in him
not perish...</i>

1304
02:16:09,978 --> 02:16:13,004
<i>but have eternal life</i>

1305
02:16:39,474 --> 02:16:41,843
The following prisoners
must present

1306
02:16:41,895 --> 02:16:45,513
and await selection.

1307
02:16:45,565 --> 02:16:49,745
6-6-7-0-0,

1308
02:16:50,252 --> 02:16:54,655
6-5-4-0-6,

1309
02:16:55,190 --> 02:16:59,388
6-6-7-1-8,

1310
02:17:00,028 --> 02:17:03,880
6-6-6-9-4,

1311
02:17:03,932 --> 02:17:06,701
No, she can not walk!

1312
02:17:06,753 --> 02:17:09,226
Bring it on!

1316
02:17:24,085 --> 02:17:26,178
Corrie...

1317
02:17:26,388 --> 02:17:30,916
What you said,
I want, I want it.

1318
02:17:31,793 --> 02:17:33,443
So ask.

1319
02:17:33,495 --> 02:17:36,131
I do not know what to ask.

1320
02:17:36,183 --> 02:17:39,862
He knows. Just ask!

1321
02:18:03,224 --> 02:18:06,159
God is with you!

1322
02:18:27,449 --> 02:18:29,417
<i>Pope...</i>

1323
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:34,380
Sleep well, Corrie...

1324
02:18:36,791 --> 02:18:39,060
- Papa?
- Yes, Corrie?

1325
02:18:39,112 --> 02:18:41,426
How to die?

1326
02:18:52,574 --> 02:18:55,260
When you and I
go to Amsterdam

1327
02:18:55,312 --> 02:18:57,730
when do I hand him
the passage?

1328
02:18:57,782 --> 02:19:00,148
Shortly before entering the train.

1329
02:19:00,200 --> 02:19:02,176
So it is with death.

1330
02:19:02,228 --> 02:19:04,100
When the time comes,

1331
02:19:04,152 --> 02:19:09,215

<i>Years later it was learned
that my release...</i>

1357
02:22:45,859 --> 02:22:49,236
<i>was due
of an administrative error.</i>

1358
02:22:49,288 --> 02:22:52,669
<i>what some might call
mistake.</i>

1359
02:22:52,721 --> 02:22:55,998
<i>Shortly after being released...</i>

<i>women of my age
were performed.</i>

1361

<i>Yes..</i>

1362
02:23:02,523 --> 02:23:05,288
<i>I'm Corrie Ten Boom...</i>

1363
02:23:05,340 --> 02:23:08,053
<i>am 80 years now.</i>

1364
02:23:09,530 --> 02:23:12,882
<i>Some questions remain...</i>

1365
02:23:12,934 --> 02:23:15,518
<i>but should not be feared.</i>

1366
02:23:15,570 --> 02:23:20,808
<i>Our Heavenly Father
has everything under His control,</i>

1367
02:23:20,860 --> 02:23:24,266
even our questions.

1368
02:23:27,215 --> 02:23:31,200
As for me,
years after Ravensbruck,

1369
02:23:31,252 --> 02:23:35,882
the Lord sent me
more than 60 countries.

1370
02:23:36,257 --> 02:23:41,295
And I have said
to everyone who can hear:

1371
02:23:41,347 --> 02:23:45,755
"No pit is so deep...

1372
02:23:46,434 --> 02:23:49,995
He can not reach. "

1373
02:23:50,672 --> 02:23:53,708
With Jesus...

1374
02:23:53,760 --> 02:23:56,748
even at
darkest,

1375
02:23:56,800 --> 02:23:59,736
the good remains...

1376
02:24:00,515 --> 02:24:04,474
and the greater good
is yet to come!

1377
02:24:05,453 --> 02:24:09,857
I promised my sister
I would say that...

1378
02:24:09,909 --> 02:24:12,655
and I tell you!
