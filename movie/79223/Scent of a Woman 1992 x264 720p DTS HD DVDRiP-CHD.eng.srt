Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us ?

309
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,477
Thank you.
You too, Mr. Willis.

I'm not quite through
with you yet.

314
00:25:03,459 --> 00:25:06,879
One of the few perks
of this office is that...

315
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:12,301
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on my own as I see fit.

- Yes, sir.
- Good.

the board and tuition in Cambridge.

Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year ?

326
00:25:48,379 --> 00:25:53,843
- No, sir.
- You. You, Mr. Simms.

327

Now can you tell me
who did it ?

No, sir, I can't.

You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothing ?

He said the same thing.
He just said it over.

Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse
from you. Are you panicking ?

- Yeah, a little.
- Come on.

- You're on scholarship, right ?
- Yeah.

You're on scholarship
from Oregon... at Baird.

You're a long way from home, Chas.

What's that got to do
with anything ?

I don't know how
it works out there.

But how it works here ?
We stick together.

348

It's us against them,
no matter what.

We don't cover our ass.
We don't tell our parents.

00:33:56,384 --> 00:33:59,845
- [ Meowing ]
- [ Frank ] Tomster, come here, boy.

461
00:33:59,887 --> 00:34:02,473
Psst, psst.
Come on.

462
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:06,561
Here, tomster, come on.
Tomster, tomster. Yeah.

463
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:12,858
Remember, when in doubt... fuck.

464
00:34:15,945 --> 00:34:18,531
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination ?

465
00:34:18,614 --> 00:34:21,534
Our destination... New York City,
home of the brave !

466
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:24,704
- Two for the shuttle to New York.
- I'm not shuttling anywhere.

467
00:34:24,787 --> 00:34:28,583
- Look at those tickets. "First class."
- Yes, sir, first class.

468
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:32,461
You bought me a ticket ?
I never said I'd go to New York.

469
00:34:32,545 --> 00:34:36,716
What are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only ?

470
00:34:36,757 --> 00:34:38,718
Gate 46, sir.

471
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:41,596
- As you were, son.
- Thank you, sir.

472
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,223
Which way's the door ?

473
00:34:44,265 --> 00:34:48,352
- Are you blind ? Are you blind ?
- Of course not.

474
00:34:48,436 --> 00:34:51,689
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm ?

475
00:34:51,772 --> 00:34:55,151
I take your arm.

476
00:34:58,446 --> 00:35:00,489
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

477
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:03,242
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life ?

478
00:35:03,451 --> 00:35:05,786
Yes !

479
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,916
- Jack Daniels...
- You bet.

480
00:35:11,959 --> 00:35:15,212
- And Diet Slice.
- The old Diet Slice.

481
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:17,590
- And a water.
- Thank you, Daphne.

482
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,550
Certainly, sir.

483
00:35:24,555 --> 00:35:26,599
Ahh ! Mmm !

484
00:35:26,682 --> 00:35:30,519
How did you know her name ?

485
00:35:30,603 --> 00:35:33,981
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

486
00:35:34,023 --> 00:35:37,235
That's an
English cologne.

487
00:35:37,318 --> 00:35:41,364
But her voice is
California chickie.

488
00:35:41,447 --> 00:35:45,326
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady --

489
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:49,038
I call her Daphne.

490
00:35:49,121 --> 00:35:53,626
Oh, big things may happen to
that little thing of yours.

491
00:35:55,044 --> 00:35:57,964
Look, Colonel,

492
00:35:58,005 --> 00:36:00,258
- I'll get you to New York, all right ?
- Uh-huh.

493
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:03,678
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

494
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,889
Well, Chuck, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

495
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:10,142
Charlie, all right ?
Or Charles.

496
00:36:10,184 --> 00:36:12,478
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

497
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,564
Chuck is a --

498
00:36:17,567 --> 00:36:20,278
So, why are we
going to New York ?

499
00:36:20,361 --> 00:36:23,906
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

500
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:27,702
Whoo-ah !

501
00:36:27,743 --> 00:36:29,954
Where's Daphne ?
Let's get her down here.

502
00:36:32,206 --> 00:36:34,166
She's in the back.

503
00:36:34,208 --> 00:36:37,795
A tail's in the tail.

504
00:36:37,878 --> 00:36:39,839
Hah !

505
00:36:39,922 --> 00:36:43,050
Oh, but I still smell her.
[ Sniffing ]

506
00:36:45,386 --> 00:36:47,888
Women !

507
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:51,058
What can you say ?

508
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,728
Who made 'em ?

509
00:36:53,811 --> 00:36:55,938
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

510
00:37:00,735 --> 00:37:03,362
The hair --

511
00:37:03,404 --> 00:37:07,533
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

512
00:37:07,617 --> 00:37:11,704
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls...

513
00:37:11,787 --> 00:37:16,626
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever ?

514
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:20,421
Or lips --

515
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,548
and when they touched,
yours were like...

516
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:26,385
that first swallow
of wine...

517
00:37:26,427 --> 00:37:28,763
after you just crossed
the desert.

518
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:35,937
Tits ! Whoo-ah !

519
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,398
Big ones, little ones,

520
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,859
nipples staring
right out at ya...

521
00:37:41,943 --> 00:37:44,904
Like secret searchlights.

522
00:37:44,946 --> 00:37:47,865
Mmm.

523
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,577
And legs --

524
00:37:51,619 --> 00:37:54,914
I don't care if
they're Greek columns...

525
00:37:54,956 --> 00:37:58,417
or secondhand Steinways.

526
00:37:58,459 --> 00:38:01,837
What's between 'em,

527
00:38:01,921 --> 00:38:04,423
passport to heaven.

528
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,260
I need a drink.

529
00:38:10,972 --> 00:38:14,267
Yes, Mr. Simms,

530
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:19,272
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing:

531
00:38:23,192 --> 00:38:25,152
pussy.

532
00:38:25,987 --> 00:38:27,905
Hah !

533
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:31,117
Are you listening to me, son ?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

534
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,996
I guess you
really like women.

535
00:38:35,037 --> 00:38:38,666
Oh, above all things !

536
00:38:43,504 --> 00:38:47,174
A very, very
distant second...

537
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:51,762
is a Ferrari.

538
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:00,980
Charlie ?

539
00:39:01,063 --> 00:39:03,232
Give me your hand.

540
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,571
This is just the start
of your education, son.

541
00:39:24,337 --> 00:39:26,297
Whoo-ah !

542
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,383
- Where are we ?
- Where are we, eh ?

543
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:32,803
The cynosure of
all things civilized:

544
00:39:32,887 --> 00:39:34,931
the Waldorf-Astoria.

545
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:39,393
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

546
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:41,395
Had a Ferrari.

547
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:44,607
Every day I held the door
open for the fucker.

548
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:46,692
Never even offered me
a ride.

549
00:39:46,776 --> 00:39:48,736
Well, fuck him.

550
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:51,197
He's dead and I'm blind.

551
00:39:54,951 --> 00:39:57,245
- Spread the word.
- Thank you, sir.

552
00:39:57,286 --> 00:40:00,873
- The intelligence will be forthcoming ?
- Sir ?

553
00:40:00,915 --> 00:40:02,917
On the escort scene.

554
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,503
Um, yes, sir.

555
00:40:05,586 --> 00:40:09,090
- And welcome to the Waldorf.
- Gracias, amigo.

556
00:40:10,591 --> 00:40:14,053
Puerto Ricans...
always made the best infantrymen.

557
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:23,604
- [ Clanking ]
- Oh !

558
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,946
I'm home again.

559
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:35,157
Give me an inventory
on this, will you ?

560
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,540
All right,
where am l, in Asia ?

561
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:45,501
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he ?

562
00:40:45,585 --> 00:40:48,296
By the windows ?

563
00:40:48,337 --> 00:40:51,340
It's right here.

564
00:40:51,424 --> 00:40:53,467
Okay.

565
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:55,886
We're in business.

566
00:40:59,807 --> 00:41:01,976
Get me the Oak Room.

567
00:41:02,018 --> 00:41:04,186
How's that inventory
comin' ?

568
00:41:06,147 --> 00:41:11,152
Uh, there's Jim Beam
and Early Times.

569
00:41:11,235 --> 00:41:14,155
Quartermaster's on the take again.
Hello.

570
00:41:14,196 --> 00:41:18,159
Is Sheldon or Mack there ?

571
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,661
This is
Lt. Col. Frank Slade.

572
00:41:20,745 --> 00:41:26,500
I used to be a regular. I used
to come in with a General Garbisch.

573
00:41:26,584 --> 00:41:30,004
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington six feet under.

574
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:34,383
Listen up. I want a table for two, and
I don't mean Siberia, 8:15.

575
00:41:35,843 --> 00:41:38,387
Clear them little
bottles off.

576
00:41:38,471 --> 00:41:41,557
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

577
00:41:41,641 --> 00:41:44,560
Tell him I want it
wall to wall with John Daniels.

578
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:47,813
Uh, don't you mean,
uh, Jack Daniels ?

579
00:41:47,855 --> 00:41:51,609
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have --

580
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:53,194
That's a joke.
Hello !

581
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:57,657
This is Lt. Col. Frank Slade.
I would like a limo, 8:00.

582
00:42:03,704 --> 00:42:05,831
What are you drinkin' ?

583
00:42:05,873 --> 00:42:09,585
Uh, nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

584
00:42:09,669 --> 00:42:12,672
What's useful about it ?

585
00:42:12,755 --> 00:42:16,550
I don't know. Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

586
00:42:16,592 --> 00:42:18,678
Where you goin' ?

587
00:42:18,761 --> 00:42:22,515
Back to school. I've got some real
important stuff I have to take care of.

588
00:42:24,225 --> 00:42:26,686
Very well.

589
00:42:26,727 --> 00:42:29,897
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

590
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:33,067
You'll dine with me and then my driver
will transport you...

591
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,696
to the airport for the Boston Shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

592
00:42:38,197 --> 00:42:41,576
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

593
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,744
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

594
00:42:45,246 --> 00:42:47,415
[ Frank ] What's your name,
driver ?

595
00:42:47,498 --> 00:42:50,167
- Manny, sir.
- Manny.

596
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:53,879
The bellhops at the Waldorf, are they
any good at getting escorts ?

597
00:42:53,921 --> 00:42:57,550
- I wouldn't know, sir.
- What would you know ?

598
00:42:57,592 --> 00:43:01,095
- About what ?
- About you-know-what ?

599
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,099
Maybe I could
manage something.

600
00:43:05,182 --> 00:43:08,311
[ Frank ] I'm talkin'
top of the line, now.

601
00:43:08,394 --> 00:43:10,646
Let me think
about this, sir.

602
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:20,323
What's the matter
with you ?

603
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:25,202
- With me ?
- Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why ?

604
00:43:25,286 --> 00:43:28,789
You got the fuckin' weight of the world
on your shoulders.

605
00:43:29,790 --> 00:43:32,501
[ Sigh ]

606
00:43:32,585 --> 00:43:35,004
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

607
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:38,007
- Spit it out !
- It's not a big deal, all right ?

608
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,009
Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin' ?

609
00:43:40,092 --> 00:43:42,762
If it's not a big deal, why did you say
"real important stuff" ?

610
00:43:42,803 --> 00:43:47,016
What are you doin', banging
the dean's daughter ? Hah !

611
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:52,313
- I'm just in a little trouble.
- What kind of trouble ?

612
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:55,608
I saw some guys
doing something.

613
00:43:56,943 --> 00:44:00,321
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

614
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:02,323

00:53:39,901 --> 00:53:43,404
what are the chances
of suitin' you up sometime ?

770
00:53:43,487 --> 00:53:46,449
- [ Operator ] Sugarbush Lodge.
- George Willis, please.

771
00:53:49,452 --> 00:53:52,872
- [ George ] Hello !
- George ! Hey, it's Charlie.

772
00:53:52,955 --> 00:53:56,083
Hey, Chas. Next year you gotta
come up with us.

773
00:53:56,167 --> 00:54:01,255
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

774
00:54:01,297 --> 00:54:03,966
Chas,
are you there ?

775
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,260
Yeah, I'm here.
Um --

776
00:54:06,302 --> 00:54:09,430
- you told me to call you for the moves.
- All right.

777
00:54:09,513 --> 00:54:12,308
For now, the move's
no move: status quo.

778
00:54:12,391 --> 00:54:14,310
Everything's
the way we left it.

779
00:54:14,393 --> 00:54:16,979
How did we leave it ?

780
00:54:17,063 --> 00:54:20,733
See no evil,
hear no evil.

781
00:54:20,816 --> 00:54:24,362
You know
what I mean, Chas ?

782
00:54:24,445 --> 00:54:27,323
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

783
00:54:29,575 --> 00:54:34,789
- Okay, then, walk like you talk !
- All right, good-bye.

784
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:39,919
- George Willis, huh ?
- Yeah.

785
00:54:40,002 --> 00:54:41,921
George Willis.

786
00:54:42,004 --> 00:54:45,925
That makes his father probably
George Willis, Senior.

787
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:47,927
Charlie, I ask ya,

788
00:54:48,010 --> 00:54:51,889
what do you think Big George
is gonna feel about Little George...

789
00:54:51,973 --> 00:54:55,017
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil ?

790
00:54:57,603 --> 00:54:59,730
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.

791
00:54:59,814 --> 00:55:02,692
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

792
00:55:02,775 --> 00:55:06,946
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing !

793
00:55:07,029 --> 00:55:09,865
Damn decent of him.
Ooh ! Aw ! Hah !

794
00:55:09,949 --> 00:55:12,243
- Scusi.
- Prego.

795
00:55:12,326 --> 00:55:14,704
I love it
when you hurt me.

796
00:55:14,787 --> 00:55:17,248
Uh, tell me now,
Charlie.

797
00:55:17,331 --> 00:55:21,294
This, uh, George Willis, Junior,
what's his father do ?

798
00:55:21,377 --> 00:55:23,421
I don't really know.

799
00:55:23,504 --> 00:55:26,048
Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

800
00:55:26,132 --> 00:55:30,886
When George Willis, Sr., isn't busy as a
million-dollar man for Aetna Casualty --

801
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:34,390
or is it New England Distributor
for the Chrysler Corporation ?

802
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:38,477
He concerns himself with his young son,
George Willis, Junior.

803
00:55:38,561 --> 00:55:41,898
George isn't going
to say anything to his father.

804
00:55:41,939 --> 00:55:44,233
Oh, Charlie.

805
00:55:44,275 --> 00:55:46,485
Big George is gonna
wind up Little George,

806
00:55:46,569 --> 00:55:49,697
and Little George is gonna sing
like a canary.

807
00:55:49,739 --> 00:55:52,283
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

808
00:55:52,366 --> 00:55:54,452
You've got this
all figured out, don't you ?

809
00:55:54,535 --> 00:55:58,915
It don't take no Young America merit
scholarship to figure this one out.

810
00:55:58,998 --> 00:56:02,877
Charlie, you had a little life,
so you decided to go to Baird...

811
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:06,005
to put yourself in the market
for a big one.

812
00:56:06,088 --> 00:56:08,049
Now, in order to stay
in the running,

813
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:10,968
you're gonna have to tell these people
what they want to know.

814
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:13,220
You think so ?

815
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:15,264
- Are we finished, Sofia ?
- Yes.

816
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:18,184
Grazie. Grazie.

817
00:56:19,977 --> 00:56:22,563
Charlie,

818
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,483
if you don't sing now,

819
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:28,861
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits...

820
00:56:28,945 --> 00:56:31,906
in some convenience store
in the Oregon burbs,

821
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:36,202
probably the last word you'll ever hear
yourself say just before you croak...

822
00:56:36,285 --> 00:56:40,248
gonna be, "Have a nice day
and come back soon."

823
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:42,500
Sofia !

824
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:46,545
Measure up Charlie, pronto.
We got a date for Thanksgiving.

825
00:56:46,629 --> 00:56:48,631
We got a date ?

826
00:56:48,714 --> 00:56:50,883
My brother's place.

827
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:53,719
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

828
00:56:53,803 --> 00:56:57,265
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

829
00:56:57,306 --> 00:57:00,101
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

830
00:57:02,478 --> 00:57:06,941
Uh, well you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

831
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:10,820
I mean, eats and treats.
I could use the company.

832
00:57:14,448 --> 00:57:17,368
All right.
D-Does he know I'm comin' ?

833
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:20,371
He doesn't know I'm comin'. But wait
till you see the look on his face...

834
00:57:20,454 --> 00:57:22,373
when I walk through
the door.

835
00:57:22,456 --> 00:57:25,126
Oh, he loves me !

836
00:57:26,460 --> 00:57:30,339
Oh, uh, Charlie,
about your little problem,

837
00:57:30,423 --> 00:57:32,925
there are two kinds of people
in this world:

838
00:57:33,009 --> 00:57:35,428
those who stand up
and face the music,

839
00:57:35,511 --> 00:57:37,430
and those who
run for cover.

840
00:57:37,513 --> 00:57:41,100
Cover's better.
Okay, Sofia, suit 'im up !

841
00:57:41,183 --> 00:57:44,812
Make him pretty !

842
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:02,121
Careful.

843
00:58:02,163 --> 00:58:05,082
- Should I ring it ?
- Yeah.

844
00:58:11,631 --> 00:58:13,633
Yes ?

845
00:58:13,716 --> 00:58:16,177
Yes !
Who is this ?

846
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,640
- It's Randy.
- Randy ? You new ?

847
00:58:20,681 --> 00:58:22,850
I'm your nephew.

848
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:25,603
Hah !
Here I am !

849
00:58:25,686 --> 00:58:28,856
Your sister's been
hoarding me long enough.

850
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,859
- Thought it's time to spread
the riches around.
- Uncle Frank !

851
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:33,903
- Gloria !
- Gail.

852
00:58:33,986 --> 00:58:35,905
Of course.

853
00:58:35,988 --> 00:58:39,450
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

854
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:42,578
Good old Uncle Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

855
00:58:42,662 --> 00:58:44,956
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

856
00:58:44,997 --> 00:58:49,252
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School too.

857
00:58:49,335 --> 00:58:51,837
Where's your
miserable father ?

858
00:58:51,921 --> 00:58:54,465
Wait ! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

859
00:58:54,507 --> 00:58:57,593
Give that fat heart
of his an attack. Willie !

860
00:58:59,887 --> 00:59:02,765
Oh, Willie !

861
00:59:13,109 --> 00:59:15,111
Hello, Frank.

862
00:59:15,194 --> 00:59:18,573
- How you doin' ?
- Okay.

863
00:59:18,656 --> 00:59:23,452
Here's my hand.
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

864
00:59:23,536 --> 00:59:25,580
Nice to meet you, sir.

865
00:59:25,663 --> 00:59:28,541
The original bulging
briefcase man.

866
00:59:28,624 --> 00:59:33,045
Gretchen, I smell those prunes !
We talkin' Turkey Marbella ?

867
00:59:33,087 --> 00:59:35,840
- Yes, we are.
- Whoo !

868
00:59:35,923 --> 00:59:38,593
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

869
00:59:38,676 --> 00:59:40,636
You know, I always had a sneaker
for you. Come here.

870
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:42,847
[ Sniffing ]
Mmm.

871
00:59:42,930 --> 00:59:44,890
Hah !

872
00:59:44,932 --> 00:59:49,186
- Where are you, Garry ?
I heard you cough.
- Who are you again ?

873
00:59:49,228 --> 00:59:53,858
I'm just here at the Waldorf-Astoria
with -- Is it your brother ?

874
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:56,402
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin' ?

875
00:59:56,444 --> 01:00:01,532
- Yes. Who the hell are you ?
- I'm kinda takin' care
of him for the weekend.

876
01:00:01,616 --> 01:00:02,742
Charlie !

877
01:00:02,825 --> 01:00:05,036
Jesus !

878
01:00:05,077 --> 01:00:09,624
Sorry. Where's the booze ?
Flowin' like mud here.

879
01:00:09,707 --> 01:00:13,961
To tell the truth, the colonel's
not well, I don't think.

880
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:17,131
- Not well ?
- I think he's a little lonely.

881
01:00:17,214 --> 01:00:20,092
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner ?

882
01:00:20,176 --> 01:00:22,803
I heard that !

883
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:25,264
I heard that.

884
01:00:25,348 --> 01:00:27,975
Pay no attention to him.
That's his big-brother talk.

885
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:30,728
He's been watching out for me
since day one.

886
01:00:30,770 --> 01:00:35,316
Bailed me out of more trouble...
than he'd like to remember.

887
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:37,902
- Hmm ?
- [ Gretchen ] Let me take your coat.

888
01:00:37,985 --> 01:00:42,448
I meant to pick up some vino
on my way, but I blew it.

889
01:00:42,531 --> 01:00:44,992
I'll send you the Rothschild
again for Christmas,

890
01:00:45,076 --> 01:00:48,996
- only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.
- I'll set two more places.

891
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,416
- Here's your drink, Frank.
- Thank you, Randy.

892
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:55,086
Still with
Snow Queen sugar ?

893
01:00:55,127 --> 01:00:58,965
Snow Flake. Why do you
always get that wrong ?

894
01:00:59,048 --> 01:01:02,343
Because it's not important for me to
get it right. What are you doing there ?

895
01:01:02,426 --> 01:01:05,680
I'm Vice President
for Marketing.

896
01:01:05,763 --> 01:01:09,725
Whoo-ah ! Congratulations !
Sugar is shit, though.

897
01:01:09,809 --> 01:01:13,229
I told General Abrams to install
honey in the commissaries.

898
01:01:13,312 --> 01:01:16,607
If the K-50s didn't blow your brains
out, sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

899
01:01:18,192 --> 01:01:20,528
- Why don't we all sit down ?
- Ooh !

900
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:24,532
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie.
Be careful.

901
01:01:24,615 --> 01:01:28,578
- When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.
- Let's go and eat.

902
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:33,583
By all means.
Thank you, Charlie.

903
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:37,795
Where you wanna sit, Frank, or you gonna
arrange yourself at the head again ?

904
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:42,133
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

905
01:01:42,216 --> 01:01:45,469
[ Frank ]
Where was I ? Oh !

906
01:01:45,511 --> 01:01:48,931
I wake up. It's four in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with,

907
01:01:49,015 --> 01:01:51,225
why I'm there
and where I am.

908
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:54,270
What am I gonna do ?
I got this Asian flower,

909
01:01:54,353 --> 01:01:58,816
all giggly and dewy-like;

910
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:02,778
and this hard-boiled
navy nurse outta Omaha, on the other.

911
01:02:02,862 --> 01:02:07,158
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

912
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:09,619
It comes to me.

913
01:02:09,702 --> 01:02:14,290
Let east meet west.
We'll build a golden bridge.

914
01:02:14,373 --> 01:02:16,083
[ Frank ]
Hah-hah !

915
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:18,836
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers !

916
01:02:23,716 --> 01:02:26,385
We all still here ?

917
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:29,889
It's a beautiful story.
[ Cough ]

918
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:36,687
- Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank ?
- Honey.

919
01:02:36,771 --> 01:02:39,065
I didn't know you were
so easily shocked.

920
01:02:39,148 --> 01:02:41,692
I admire your sensibilities.
I'm touched.

921
01:02:41,776 --> 01:02:44,820
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank...

922
01:02:44,904 --> 01:02:48,241
- to go to the kennel ?
- What about it ?

923
01:02:48,324 --> 01:02:51,619
- He almost put the seeing eye
dog business outta business.
- Cool it, Randy.

924
01:02:51,702 --> 01:02:55,873
- It's over and done with.
- Indeed it is, Garry.

925
01:02:55,957 --> 01:02:58,292
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

926
01:02:58,376 --> 01:03:01,462
Charlie, what time do you have ?
I think we better be gettin' back.

927
01:03:01,545 --> 01:03:06,467
- You ever given any thought
to a braille watch, Frank ?
- Randy.

928
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:10,513
- Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him too ?
- Honey, please.

929
01:03:10,596 --> 01:03:12,890
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's observations.

930
01:03:12,932 --> 01:03:16,894
My wife's name is Gail, Frank.
Can you hear that ? Gail.

931
01:03:16,978 --> 01:03:19,438
Excuse me.
Gail.

932
01:03:19,522 --> 01:03:23,276
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

933
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:25,945
but there's a
little tension in her voice.

934
01:03:26,028 --> 01:03:28,823
It could be one
of two things:

935
01:03:28,906 --> 01:03:31,284
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

936
01:03:31,993 --> 01:03:35,830
What's your point,
Uncle Frank ?

937
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,165
You oughta go down
on her.

938
01:03:38,207 --> 01:03:40,334
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya ?

939
01:03:40,418 --> 01:03:43,796
You're so wrapped up in sugar, you've
forgotten the taste of real honey !

940
01:03:43,838 --> 01:03:45,715
Frank,
for God's sake !

941
01:03:45,798 --> 01:03:48,426
Hear that voice ?
There's fire under that dress.

942
01:03:48,509 --> 01:03:50,595
- Will you cut it out ?
- Just get the fuck outta here.

943
01:03:50,678 --> 01:03:53,097
- Whoo-ah !
- Get in your limousine.

944
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,350
Go down to the bowery, get with the
other fucking drunks where you belong !

945
01:03:56,434 --> 01:03:58,603
- Wait a minute.
- What ?

946
01:03:58,686 --> 01:04:01,647
- Could you take it easy ?
- What for ?

947
01:04:01,689 --> 01:04:04,191
You want me to lay off him,
Chuckie, 'cause he's blind ?

948
01:04:04,275 --> 01:04:07,236
- No, but I mean --
- My friend's name is Charles.

949
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,822
He doesn't like
to be called Chuckie.

950
01:04:09,864 --> 01:04:13,534
- This is supposed to be a family
get-together. This is --
- A warning.

951
01:04:13,618 --> 01:04:17,788
Jesus Christ. Another sucker who thinks
this shitheel's a war hero.

952
01:04:17,872 --> 01:04:20,750
Whoo-ah.

953
01:04:22,209 --> 01:04:25,379
Well, once... maybe.

954
01:04:25,463 --> 01:04:29,383
I suppose he told you about his days
on Lyndon Johnson's staff ?

955
01:04:29,467 --> 01:04:32,053
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

956
01:04:32,136 --> 01:04:35,848
- Frank was earmarked for general.
- Earmarked, good word.

957
01:04:35,932 --> 01:04:40,102
- But Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye !
- Randy, that's enough.

958
01:04:40,186 --> 01:04:44,565
So -- What do they call it when they
give you the shaft in the military ?

959
01:04:44,649 --> 01:04:49,111
- Passed over !
- Frank was passed over for promotion...

960
01:04:49,195 --> 01:04:52,615
Couple times.

961
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:57,787
- You want to know what happened then ?
- Will you shut your mouth ?

962
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:02,708
- He blew himself up.
- Stop it, Randy.

963
01:05:02,750 --> 01:05:06,170
Our colonel, here, had a grenade
juggling act at Fort Bragg or wherever.

964
01:05:06,254 --> 01:05:09,548
- Fort Benning.
- He was teaching hand-to-hand combat --

965
01:05:09,632 --> 01:05:13,261
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me, son.

966
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:17,848
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act was some captain.

967
01:05:17,932 --> 01:05:20,560
- Major Vincent Squires.
- Yeah, whoever he was.

968
01:05:20,643 --> 01:05:24,146
Before going on, they'd have themselves
a lo-cal breakfast:

969
01:05:24,230 --> 01:05:26,148
a Screwdriver for Frank,
Bloody Mary for his partner.

970
01:05:26,232 --> 01:05:28,067
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

971
01:05:28,150 --> 01:05:31,445
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col.
Slade had four to his partner's one.

972
01:05:31,445 --> 01:05:33,656
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col.
Slade had four to his partner's one.

973
01:05:33,739 --> 01:05:36,242
He's flying in class.
He gets all excited.

974
01:05:36,284 --> 01:05:38,953
He starts pulling
the pins out.

975
01:05:40,955 --> 01:05:43,583
[ Randy ] One grenade
got away from him.

976
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:46,627
Boom.

977
01:05:48,296 --> 01:05:50,214
The one that got away.

978
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:54,260
Oh, the pin was in...
Frank claims.

979
01:05:54,302 --> 01:05:56,220
In or out, what
difference does it make ?

980
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,514
What kind of fucking lunatic
juggles grenades ?

981
01:05:58,598 --> 01:06:01,100
Vinnie came out okay.

982
01:06:01,142 --> 01:06:03,728
And all Frank lost
was his eyesight.

983
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:10,443
- Wanna know the truth ?
- You got a handle on that,
do you, Randy ?

984
01:06:10,526 --> 01:06:13,613
- He was an asshole before.
- Whoo-ah !

985
01:06:13,654 --> 01:06:17,491
Now all he is
is a blind asshole.

986
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:19,619
Whoo-ah.

987
01:06:26,125 --> 01:06:29,128
Hey, God's a funny guy.

988
01:06:29,211 --> 01:06:34,300
God doth have
a sense of humor.

989
01:06:34,342 --> 01:06:39,347
Maybe God thinks some
people don't deserve to see.

990
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:42,934
[ Sigh ]
Whoo-ah. Hah !

991
01:06:45,353 --> 01:06:47,230
You get the point...
Chuckie ?

992
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:53,986
- Aah !
- His name is Charles.

993
01:06:55,154 --> 01:06:57,323
You can say that,
can't you ? Charles.

994
01:06:57,365 --> 01:07:01,577
Know what this is, Randy ? It's a choke
hold I'm teaching those lieutenants.

995
01:07:01,661 --> 01:07:05,998
- Little pressure, I bust your windpipe.
- I don't care what he said.

996
01:07:06,040 --> 01:07:09,377
- Charles.
- Just let go, please !

997
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:12,129
[ Gasping ]

998
01:07:29,397 --> 01:07:32,149
Gretchen ?

999
01:07:32,233 --> 01:07:35,444
You outdid yourself.

1000
01:07:35,528 --> 01:07:38,406
If you twist my arm
hard enough,

1001
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:41,450
we're talking
Turkey Marbella next year.

1002
01:07:41,534 --> 01:07:44,662
Who knows ?

1003
01:07:47,790 --> 01:07:49,834
Frank ?

1004
01:07:49,917 --> 01:07:53,546
Good-bye, Willie.

1005
01:07:58,217 --> 01:08:02,221
I'm no fucking good...

1006
01:08:02,305 --> 01:08:05,057
and I never have been.

1007
01:08:10,271 --> 01:08:13,608
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

1008
01:08:19,238 --> 01:08:23,117
Come on.
Watch your step.

1009
01:08:23,993 --> 01:08:26,996
Hold it.

1010
01:08:39,425 --> 01:08:43,554
Nueva York, compadre.
Vamos !

1011
01:08:47,141 --> 01:08:49,310
[ Clinking ]

1012
01:09:27,682 --> 01:09:29,767
You got a watch ?

1013
01:09:32,853 --> 01:09:35,106
Ah, it's 7:20.

1014
01:09:35,189 --> 01:09:39,151
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1015
01:09:39,193 --> 01:09:41,320
Yeah, in the other room.

1016
01:09:41,362 --> 01:09:43,990
Get it.

1017
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:49,120
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1018
01:09:50,871 --> 01:09:53,332
Does it have
a second hand ?

1019
01:09:58,504 --> 01:10:00,506
Yeah.

1020
01:10:00,548 --> 01:10:02,883
Time me !

1021
01:10:29,368 --> 01:10:31,370
How long ?

1022
01:10:32,914 --> 01:10:36,542
Um... about
30 seconds.

1023
01:10:36,584 --> 01:10:40,755
- I'm rusty.
- Where did you get a gun, Colonel ?

1024
01:10:40,838 --> 01:10:43,716
Piece or weapon, Charlie,
never a gun.

1025
01:10:46,594 --> 01:10:48,971
Where did you get
the piece ?

1026
01:10:49,055 --> 01:10:53,517
I'm an officer in the
United States Army. This is my sidearm.

1027
01:10:53,601 --> 01:10:57,939
- But you're not an officer anymore.
- So I'm retired, so what ?

1028
01:10:57,980 --> 01:11:01,317
An officer never
relinquishes his 45.

1029
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:05,321
Yeah, but you better relinquish it to me
or I'm gonna call Mrs. Rossi.

1030
01:11:05,404 --> 01:11:07,073
Good idea.

1031
01:11:07,156 --> 01:11:09,742
Then I'm going back
to school.

1032
01:11:09,784 --> 01:11:12,453
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1033
01:11:12,536 --> 01:11:16,123
I hope you have a wonderful trip.
That felt like 25.

1034
01:11:16,207 --> 01:11:18,960
You oughta be able to do a 45 in 25.
Did you time me ?

1035
01:11:19,043 --> 01:11:22,213
No, I did not
and I'm calling Albany.

1036
01:11:29,428 --> 01:11:32,431
That was stupid.

1037
01:11:32,515 --> 01:11:36,185
Was it ?

1038
01:11:36,269 --> 01:11:39,021
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

1039
01:11:39,105 --> 01:11:41,315
No, I'm not.

1040
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,734
- I'm outta here !
- Where you goin' ? New Hampshire ?

1041
01:11:43,776 --> 01:11:47,655
You got no money.
How you gonna do that ?

1042
01:11:47,738 --> 01:11:50,449
Mmm.

1043
01:11:50,491 --> 01:11:54,495
Karen's number
tastes like Albany. Hah !

1044
01:11:54,579 --> 01:11:56,789
Fine.

1045
01:11:56,872 --> 01:12:00,126
- I'm leaving.
- Charlie ? Charlie !

1046
01:12:12,805 --> 01:12:17,268
All I want from you...
is another day.

1047
01:12:17,351 --> 01:12:19,770
For what ?

1048
01:12:21,898 --> 01:12:25,985
One last tour
of the battlefield.

1049
01:12:28,654 --> 01:12:32,116
I can get around a city
like New York,

1050
01:12:32,158 --> 01:12:34,118
but l...

1051
01:12:34,160 --> 01:12:38,039
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1052
01:12:40,207 --> 01:12:42,168
What do you say,
Charlie ?

1053
01:12:42,251 --> 01:12:45,421
What's one day...
between friends ?

1054
01:12:49,216 --> 01:12:52,178
All right. Well, say
I stay for another day.

1055
01:12:52,261 --> 01:12:54,513
Will you give me
your weapon ?

1056
01:12:54,555 --> 01:12:58,643
Oh, Charlie ! I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1057
01:12:58,726 --> 01:13:01,187
I'm not giving my
fucking gun to anyone.

1058
01:13:01,229 --> 01:13:05,816
- Now, what are you drinkin' ?
- Colonel, this -- this is unacceptable.

1059
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:10,738
Unacceptable ? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for ?

1060
01:13:10,821 --> 01:13:14,325
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy ?

1061
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:16,410
Put in Harvard
Business School ?

1062
01:13:16,494 --> 01:13:19,080
Then give me
your bullets.

1063
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:30,258
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you ?

1064
01:13:31,842 --> 01:13:35,096
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

1065
01:13:35,179 --> 01:13:37,807
So, why
should I share...

1066
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:42,144
the tribe's provisions ?

1067
01:13:42,228 --> 01:13:44,689
I mean,
there's no one...

1068
01:13:44,730 --> 01:13:49,193
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1069
01:13:49,235 --> 01:13:51,404
The bullets, Colonel.

1070
01:13:51,487 --> 01:13:53,573
"The bullets, Colonel."

1071
01:13:53,656 --> 01:13:56,367
You sound like a guy in
"Lives of a Bengal Lancer."

1072
01:14:16,095 --> 01:14:18,264
What do you
give a shit for ?

1073
01:14:18,347 --> 01:14:20,766
About what ?

1074
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:23,019
About what ?

1075
01:14:23,102 --> 01:14:27,106
About whether I blow
my brains out or not.

1076
01:14:30,943 --> 01:14:35,072
- Because I have a conscience, you know.
- You have a conscience.

1077
01:14:35,114 --> 01:14:37,909
I forgot.

1078
01:14:39,452 --> 01:14:42,163
The Charlie Conscience.

1079
01:14:43,456 --> 01:14:47,501
Do we tell ?
Do we not tell ?

1080
01:14:47,585 --> 01:14:51,255
Do we follow the
rich boy's code or not ?

1081
01:14:51,297 --> 01:14:54,383
Do we let this
blind asshole...

1082
01:14:54,467 --> 01:14:57,136
die... or not ?

1083
01:14:57,178 --> 01:14:58,721
Yeah.

1084
01:14:58,804 --> 01:15:00,932
Conscience, Charlie.

1085
01:15:00,973 --> 01:15:03,434
When were you born, son ?

1086
01:15:03,476 --> 01:15:07,438
Around the time
of the Round Table ? Hah.

1087
01:15:07,521 --> 01:15:09,649
Haven't you heard ?

1088
01:15:09,732 --> 01:15:12,944
Conscience is dead.

1089
01:15:12,985 --> 01:15:15,696
No, I haven't heard.

1090
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:20,826
Well, then, take the
fucking wax outta your ears !

1091
01:15:20,910 --> 01:15:22,828
Grow up !

1092
01:15:34,382 --> 01:15:37,510
It's fuck your buddy.

1093
01:15:37,593 --> 01:15:40,596
Cheat on your wife.

1094
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:46,310
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

1095
01:15:47,353 --> 01:15:52,316
Charlie,
it's all shit.

1096
01:16:02,118 --> 01:16:04,370
Where you goin' ?

1097
01:16:04,412 --> 01:16:07,999
I got piss call.

1098
01:16:08,082 --> 01:16:11,919
I know I said I need ya
for just one day,

1099
01:16:12,003 --> 01:16:14,463
but even I can't hold it
that long.

1100
01:16:16,716 --> 01:16:19,135
Oh, and, Charlie,

1101
01:16:19,218 --> 01:16:21,846
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

1102
01:16:27,518 --> 01:16:29,437
Hah !

1103
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,898
There you go,
sir.

1104
01:16:31,981 --> 01:16:33,816
Thank you.

1105
01:16:37,069 --> 01:16:40,239
Twenty-six years
in the service,

1106
01:16:40,323 --> 01:16:42,575
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

1107
01:16:42,658 --> 01:16:46,203
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie ?

1108
01:16:46,287 --> 01:16:50,207
Playing golf with your friends
from the Baird School, I bet.

1109
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:55,421
I don't even like
those guys.

1110
01:16:55,463 --> 01:16:58,716
Course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1111
01:16:58,758 --> 01:17:01,802
Be a pleasure to squeal
on 'em, wouldn't it ?

1112
01:17:01,886 --> 01:17:06,307
- Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.
- "I'm not a squealer."

1113
01:17:06,390 --> 01:17:08,476
What is this,
the Dreyfus case ?

1114
01:17:12,939 --> 01:17:15,107
Ohh ! Ooh, Mama !

1115
01:17:15,191 --> 01:17:17,443
There you go.

1116
01:17:17,526 --> 01:17:20,446
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1117
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:22,490
Watch your step.

1118
01:17:25,409 --> 01:17:28,788
I'm gettin' that
heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1119
01:17:31,499 --> 01:17:35,503
There's more to this,
isn't there ?

1120
01:17:35,586 --> 01:17:37,672
Isn't there ?

1121
01:17:40,049 --> 01:17:43,886
- I was offered a bribe.
- Oh, now we're cookin'.

1122
01:17:45,471 --> 01:17:48,099
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

1123
01:17:49,141 --> 01:17:51,978
he promised to
get me into Harvard.

1124
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:55,314
- If you squeal.
- Yeah.

1125
01:17:55,398 --> 01:17:57,692
What a dilemma.

1126
01:17:57,775 --> 01:18:03,155
Should Charlie Simms accept a
free ride into Harvard or not ?

1127
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:07,326
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes ?

1128
01:18:07,410 --> 01:18:09,495
- He is, practically.
- How ?

1129
01:18:09,579 --> 01:18:14,333
I mean, it's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get him into Harvard.

1130
01:18:14,417 --> 01:18:18,671
Mr. Trask doesn't have to. George's
father's gonna take care of that.

1131
01:18:20,756 --> 01:18:23,551
Do the deal, Charlie.
Take it !

1132
01:18:23,634 --> 01:18:26,095
Go to Harvard.

1133
01:18:26,178 --> 01:18:29,015
- I can't do that.
- Why not ?

1134
01:18:30,933 --> 01:18:34,395
It's just some things
you just can't do.

1135
01:18:34,478 --> 01:18:36,856
Explain 'em to me.

1136
01:18:37,899 --> 01:18:42,653
- Louder, please.
- I, l, I can't --

1137
01:18:42,695 --> 01:18:45,907
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1138
01:18:47,241 --> 01:18:51,704
To ease the blow,
let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1139
01:18:51,996 --> 01:18:54,498
[ Frank ] Double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

1140
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:58,878
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1141
01:18:58,920 --> 01:19:00,963
Hold on.
Do you have beer ?

1142
01:19:01,047 --> 01:19:03,591
Certainly.
May I see some I.D. ?

1143
01:19:03,674 --> 01:19:06,886
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy ?

1144
01:19:06,928 --> 01:19:08,220
Sir, but --

1145
01:19:08,304 --> 01:19:11,807
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1146
01:19:11,891 --> 01:19:14,685
Why don't you call up front,
the office ?

1147
01:19:14,727 --> 01:19:18,189
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1148
01:19:18,272 --> 01:19:21,400
Any particular beer ?

1149
01:19:21,484 --> 01:19:24,779
Schlitz.
No Schlitz ?

1150
01:19:24,862 --> 01:19:27,281
Blatz.
No Blatz ?

1151
01:19:27,365 --> 01:19:29,742
Improvise.

1152
01:19:29,784 --> 01:19:33,037
- I'll do my best, sir.
- [ Frank ] Thank you, sir.

1153
01:19:34,747 --> 01:19:38,542
You're human, Charlie.
Beer ?

1154
01:19:40,962 --> 01:19:43,130
Who are we
drinking with ?

1155
01:19:43,214 --> 01:19:47,718
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1156
01:19:54,392 --> 01:19:58,062
- Ah... female.
- Female ?

1157
01:19:58,145 --> 01:20:02,567
You're callin' her female, must mean you
like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1158
01:20:05,236 --> 01:20:08,864
- Is she alone ?
- Yeah, she's alone.

1159
01:20:11,158 --> 01:20:14,412
Things are heatin' up.
Chestnut hair ?

1160
01:20:14,495 --> 01:20:17,832
Brown...
Light brown.

1161
01:20:17,915 --> 01:20:21,127
Twenty-two ?

1162
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:25,506
Wh-- What am l,
a guy at a carnival ?

1163
01:20:25,590 --> 01:20:29,552
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1164
01:20:29,635 --> 01:20:31,887
Move.

1165
01:20:31,971 --> 01:20:34,181
- Where ?
- You know where, son.

1166
01:20:34,265 --> 01:20:36,559
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1167
01:20:37,852 --> 01:20:40,771
This woman is made for you.
I can feel it.

1168
01:20:40,855 --> 01:20:43,107
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she ?

1169
01:20:43,190 --> 01:20:47,820
- She's not bad.
- Whoo-bingo ! The boy's alive.

1170
01:20:47,904 --> 01:20:51,532
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1171
01:20:51,616 --> 01:20:55,286
Perambulate.

1172
01:21:02,793 --> 01:21:06,714
Excuse me, senorita,
do you mind if we join you ?

1173
01:21:08,090 --> 01:21:10,176
I'm feelin'
you're being neglected.

1174
01:21:10,259 --> 01:21:13,846
Well, I'm
expecting somebody.

1175
01:21:13,888 --> 01:21:17,141
Instantly ?

1176
01:21:17,225 --> 01:21:21,437
- No, but any minute now.
- Any minute ?

1177
01:21:21,520 --> 01:21:24,190
Some people live a lifetime
in a minute.

1178
01:21:26,067 --> 01:21:30,363
- What are you doin' right now ?
- I'm waiting for him.

1179
01:21:30,446 --> 01:21:33,532
Would you mind
if we waited with you,

1180
01:21:33,574 --> 01:21:37,745
you know, just to keep the
womanizers from bothering you ?

1181
01:21:40,831 --> 01:21:42,792
No, I don't mind.

1182
01:21:42,875 --> 01:21:45,544
Thank you.

1183
01:21:47,880 --> 01:21:49,840
Charlie.

1184
01:21:53,135 --> 01:21:56,514
You know, I detect...
a fragrance in the air.

1185
01:21:56,597 --> 01:21:58,975
Don't tell me
what it is.

1186
01:21:59,058 --> 01:22:01,269
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1187
01:22:01,352 --> 01:22:04,564
Ah, that's amazing.

1188
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:06,899
I'm in the amazing
business !

1189
01:22:06,941 --> 01:22:08,943
It is
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1190
01:22:09,026 --> 01:22:12,321
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1191
01:22:12,405 --> 01:22:14,615
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

1192
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:17,493
I think she'd have liked
Charlie too.

1193
01:22:17,577 --> 01:22:19,870
- Don't pay any attention to him.
- What's your name ?

1194
01:22:19,954 --> 01:22:21,455
Donna.

1195
01:22:21,539 --> 01:22:26,252
- Donna ? I'm Frank. This here is --
- This is Charlie.

1196
01:22:26,335 --> 01:22:28,462
Yes. She likes you.

1197
01:22:28,546 --> 01:22:31,757
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.
He's going through a crisis.

1198
01:22:31,841 --> 01:22:34,594
How does he look
like he's holding up ?

1199
01:22:34,677 --> 01:22:37,638
He looks fine to me.

1200
01:22:37,680 --> 01:22:40,141
Oh ! She does
like you, Charlie.

1201
01:22:44,812 --> 01:22:47,064
So, Donna,

1202
01:22:47,148 --> 01:22:48,858
ah...

1203
01:22:48,941 --> 01:22:50,943
do you tango ?

1204
01:22:51,027 --> 01:22:54,614
No. I wanted
to learn once, but --

1205
01:22:54,697 --> 01:22:57,074
But ?

1206
01:22:57,158 --> 01:22:59,744
But Michael
didn't want to.

1207
01:22:59,827 --> 01:23:03,205
Michael, the one
you're waiting for.

1208
01:23:03,289 --> 01:23:07,001
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1209
01:23:07,084 --> 01:23:10,338
Well, I think
Michael's hysterical.

1210
01:23:10,421 --> 01:23:13,633
Don't pay any attention to him.
Did I already say that ?

1211
01:23:15,551 --> 01:23:18,054
What a beautiful laugh.

1212
01:23:19,555 --> 01:23:21,557
Thank you, Frank.

1213
01:23:26,312 --> 01:23:29,440
Would you like to learn
to tango, Donna ?

1214
01:23:32,526 --> 01:23:34,528
Right now ?

1215
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:39,242
I'm offering you my services...
free of charge.

1216
01:23:39,325 --> 01:23:41,285
What do you say ?

1217
01:23:41,369 --> 01:23:43,162
Ah...

1218
01:23:43,246 --> 01:23:46,374
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1219
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:48,626
Of what ?

1220
01:23:48,709 --> 01:23:52,964
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1221
01:23:53,047 --> 01:23:57,343
No mistakes in the tango,
not like life.

1222
01:23:57,426 --> 01:24:00,012
It's simple. That's what makes
the tango so great.

1223
01:24:00,096 --> 01:24:04,934
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

1224
01:24:05,017 --> 01:24:08,521
[ Frank ]
Why don't you try ?

1225
01:24:12,316 --> 01:24:14,944
Will you try it ?

1226
01:24:15,027 --> 01:24:18,531
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1227
01:24:18,614 --> 01:24:21,284
Hold me down, son.

1228
01:24:28,332 --> 01:24:30,793
Your arm.

1229
01:24:32,587 --> 01:24:35,214
Charlie,

1230
01:24:35,298 --> 01:24:37,842
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1231
01:24:37,925 --> 01:24:40,886
The floor's
about 20 by 30,

1232
01:24:40,970 --> 01:24:43,931
And you're at
the long end.

1233
01:24:44,015 --> 01:24:48,019
There's tables on the outside.
The band's on the right.

1234
01:27:26,844 --> 01:27:31,515
Oh, Frank, you are
one incredible dancer.

1235
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:37,730
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1236
01:27:37,813 --> 01:27:40,942
- He's a liar. I don't dance.
- Isn't he a charmer, though ?

1237
01:27:41,025 --> 01:27:45,196
Truth is, not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1238
01:27:45,279 --> 01:27:47,949
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1239
01:27:48,032 --> 01:27:50,076
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1240
01:27:50,159 --> 01:27:53,788
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1241
01:27:53,871 --> 01:27:57,500
-Hi, Frank, Charlie. I'm sorry I'm late.
-Oh, that's okay.

1242
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:00,294
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1243
01:28:00,336 --> 01:28:02,964
and time flew.

1244
01:28:03,047 --> 01:28:06,842
Your girl is...
a hell of a tango dancer.

1245
01:28:06,926 --> 01:28:09,553
You found someone to tango with.
That's terrific !

1246
01:28:09,637 --> 01:28:11,639
Let me
shake your hand.

1247
01:28:11,722 --> 01:28:14,976
- No, it was Frank.
- Hell, I'll shake both your hands !

1248
01:28:16,477 --> 01:28:19,272
Honey, this looks like the place,
but we gotta go.

1249
01:28:19,355 --> 01:28:22,441
We got a date with Darryl
and Carol in the village.

1250
01:28:22,525 --> 01:28:24,443
Do you have a check ?

1251
01:28:24,527 --> 01:28:29,198
- Michael, please. My pleasure.
- No, no. I got this.

1252
01:28:29,282 --> 01:28:32,118
Michael, get your hand outta
your pocket. I'll take it. Really.

1253
01:28:32,201 --> 01:28:35,705
Allow me.

1254
01:28:35,788 --> 01:28:38,332
Why, thank you.

1255
01:28:38,374 --> 01:28:40,376
Bye, guys.

1256
01:28:40,418 --> 01:28:42,587
Bye.

1257
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,598
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1258
01:29:01,564 --> 01:29:04,859
[ Manny ] It's Apartment 17 E, Colonel.
She's expecting you.

1259
01:29:04,942 --> 01:29:08,863
You don't have to worry about a thing.
She's the creme de la creme.

1260
01:29:08,905 --> 01:29:11,407
My buddy took the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1261
01:29:11,490 --> 01:29:13,910
Now he wants to immigrate
to this country.

1262
01:29:13,993 --> 01:29:16,037
[ Frank ]
You did good, hombre.

1263
01:29:18,414 --> 01:29:21,250
My hair,
how is it ?

1264
01:29:21,292 --> 01:29:23,252
It's perfect.

1265
01:29:26,088 --> 01:29:30,301
- I got the red foulard okay, didn't I ?
- Yeah, real dark red.

1266
01:29:30,384 --> 01:29:32,762
Burgundy, Charlie,
burgundy.

1267
01:29:32,845 --> 01:29:35,723
They love it.

1268
01:29:35,765 --> 01:29:38,392
Bay Rum.

1269
01:29:39,393 --> 01:29:42,438
Windsor knot.

1270
01:29:42,521 --> 01:29:45,399
[ Sigh ] That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

1271
01:29:54,158 --> 01:29:56,160
I'm off.

1272
01:30:14,345 --> 01:30:16,305
Can you get long distance
on this ?

1273
01:30:16,389 --> 01:30:18,391
And how.
Be my guest.

1274
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:32,738
- Sugarbush lodge.
- Hi. George Willis, please ?

1275
01:30:32,822 --> 01:30:35,408
One moment, please.

1276
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,160
- Hello ?
- Ah, Harry ?

1277
01:30:38,244 --> 01:30:40,496
Chas, how are you ?

1278
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:43,749
You just caught us. We're about
to shoot George over to the airport.

1279
01:30:43,833 --> 01:30:46,669
Why is George
going to the airport ?

1280
01:30:46,711 --> 01:30:50,089
Um, hold on. Maybe you should talk
to the man himself.

1281
01:30:51,382 --> 01:30:53,426
- Chas.
- Yeah. Hi, George.

1282
01:30:53,509 --> 01:30:57,471
- You just caught me.
- Harry said. Where you goin' ?

1283
01:30:57,555 --> 01:31:00,057
- Home.
- To Boston ?

1284
01:31:00,141 --> 01:31:03,019
Catching the puddle jumper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1285
01:31:03,102 --> 01:31:06,606
What are you
going home for ?

1286
01:31:06,689 --> 01:31:10,443
[ Sigh ] I was thinking, Chas.
This asshole, Trask ?

1287
01:31:10,526 --> 01:31:13,195
He's making
no sense at all.

1288
01:31:13,279 --> 01:31:17,033
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father's Class of '59.

1289
01:31:17,074 --> 01:31:20,912
Your father ? I thought we were
gonna keep our parents outta this.

1290
01:31:20,995 --> 01:31:25,249
This guy Trask is outta control, Chas.
Outta control !

1291
01:31:25,333 --> 01:31:27,627
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.

1292
01:31:27,710 --> 01:31:31,672
- My father's a major
fund-raiser, you know.
- No, I didn't.

1293
01:31:31,756 --> 01:31:35,509
Just relax.
He'll get us off the hook.

1294
01:31:35,593 --> 01:31:38,721
- I gotta go. Everything all right ?
- Sure.

1295
01:31:38,804 --> 01:31:42,683
- I'll see you Monday. Good-bye.
- Bye.

1296
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:09,418
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1297
01:32:21,305 --> 01:32:23,266
Hiya, Charlie.

1298
01:32:24,809 --> 01:32:26,811
Watch the door.

1299
01:32:44,704 --> 01:32:47,248
What a beautiful woman.

1300
01:33:00,469 --> 01:33:04,432
- Hello, there.
- Do you see what I see ?

1301
01:33:04,515 --> 01:33:07,643
[ TV ] Yeah.
Either there's something wrong,

1302
01:33:07,727 --> 01:33:10,146
or we got the
world's worst hangover.

1303
01:33:10,229 --> 01:33:14,400
Won't you come in ?

1304
01:33:14,483 --> 01:33:16,444
[ TV Off ]

1305
01:33:32,418 --> 01:33:34,378
Colonel ?

1306
01:33:46,974 --> 01:33:50,269
Colonel,
you all right ?

1307
01:33:50,353 --> 01:33:53,189
What is there ?

1308
01:33:56,776 --> 01:34:01,989
It's afternoon.
You've been sleeping all morning.

1309
01:34:02,073 --> 01:34:04,700
So what ?

1310
01:34:04,784 --> 01:34:08,412
I don't know.
I thought --

1311
01:34:12,792 --> 01:34:14,835
I-l talked to George
last night.

1312
01:34:14,919 --> 01:34:17,129
His, ah --

1313
01:34:17,213 --> 01:34:21,592
His father's a big-deal alumnus
at school. He's got a lot of pull.

1314
01:34:21,676 --> 01:34:24,720
Really ?

1315
01:34:24,804 --> 01:34:28,558
Yeah, he's, ah,

1316
01:34:28,641 --> 01:34:30,935
he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1317
01:34:31,018 --> 01:34:34,313
George thinks he might
be able to get us off the hook.

1318
01:34:34,397 --> 01:34:37,066
"Get us off the hook."

1319
01:34:37,149 --> 01:34:39,902
Yeah, that's --
that's what he said.

1320
01:34:39,944 --> 01:34:43,781
Watch the "us" part.

1321
01:34:45,616 --> 01:34:48,452
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something ?

1322
01:34:48,536 --> 01:34:51,497
[ Groan ]

1323
01:34:52,665 --> 01:34:54,500
Colonel ?

1324
01:34:54,584 --> 01:34:58,170
Oh, Charlie,
what do ya want ?

1325
01:34:58,254 --> 01:35:00,214
I don't know !

1326
01:35:00,298 --> 01:35:03,426
But you're
making me nervous.

1327
01:35:06,387 --> 01:35:09,557
My wallet is on
the dresser.

1328
01:35:09,640 --> 01:35:11,851
Take out
your plane ticket...

1329
01:35:11,934 --> 01:35:16,772
and $400
mustering-out pay,

1330
01:35:16,814 --> 01:35:19,233
plus...

1331
01:35:19,317 --> 01:35:23,696
airport-to-school taxi.

1332
01:35:25,156 --> 01:35:28,242
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can --

1333
01:35:28,326 --> 01:35:30,328
I could stay
for a while.

1334
01:35:30,411 --> 01:35:34,290
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

1335
01:35:34,332 --> 01:35:38,294
For that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1336
01:35:40,087 --> 01:35:44,800
But right now I have...
other plans.

1337
01:35:44,884 --> 01:35:47,511
What other plans
do you have ?

1338
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:51,641
To die, son.

1339
01:35:51,724 --> 01:35:55,853
Colonel, you're --

1340
01:35:55,937 --> 01:35:58,648
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1341
01:35:58,689 --> 01:36:02,485
Charlie,
give me your hand.

1342
01:36:06,364 --> 01:36:08,991
You go now, boy.
Okay ?

1343
01:36:10,826 --> 01:36:13,871
You go.
Just, uh --

1344
01:36:16,457 --> 01:36:18,793
Just leave me
sleep here.

1345
01:36:19,877 --> 01:36:23,047
Look, uh --
Can we start over, please ?

1346
01:36:23,130 --> 01:36:27,343
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh ?

1347
01:36:27,426 --> 01:36:29,929
I mean, look at this.
The sun is shining !

1348
01:36:30,012 --> 01:36:32,473
It's a beautiful day.
Let's --

1349
01:36:35,810 --> 01:36:39,313
Colonel, I know you don't want
to be a party poop,

1350
01:36:39,397 --> 01:36:43,401
so let's go out and do something, huh ?
Let's go for a ride.

1351
01:36:48,656 --> 01:36:50,783
Yeah, a ride.

1352
01:36:50,866 --> 01:36:54,078
A ride ?

1353
01:36:54,161 --> 01:36:57,873
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say ?

1354
01:36:57,957 --> 01:37:01,002
Let's go for a ride,
huh ?

1355
01:37:07,758 --> 01:37:10,094
What kind of ride ?

1356
01:37:11,512 --> 01:37:13,723
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1357
01:37:14,265 --> 01:37:17,727
and we let appropriate customers
test-drive the Testarossa.

1358
01:37:17,810 --> 01:37:21,814
But you're 17 and with
a blind companion. That we don't do.

1359
01:37:21,898 --> 01:37:24,817
This is a $190,000
piece of machinery.

1360
01:37:24,901 --> 01:37:28,279
- I'm not letting it out this door.
- How 'bout this one over here ?

1361
01:37:28,362 --> 01:37:31,198
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1362
01:37:31,282 --> 01:37:35,578
Think I'm gonna let an unaccompanied kid
get behind the wheel of a $110,000 car ?

1363
01:37:35,661 --> 01:37:38,164
He will not be
unaccompanied.

1364
01:37:38,247 --> 01:37:41,834
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1365
01:37:41,918 --> 01:37:44,879
- You're his father ?
- Yes.

1366
01:37:44,962 --> 01:37:48,257
I have an idea. Why don't I take
your father for a test-drive ?

1367
01:37:48,341 --> 01:37:52,261
- What's your quota, Freddie ?
- Don't worry about my quota. I do well.

1368
01:37:52,303 --> 01:37:54,347
How many Ferraris
you sold this month ?

1369
01:37:54,430 --> 01:37:57,099
That's not relevant
to this discussion.

1370
01:37:57,183 --> 01:37:59,268
Freddie,
the 80s are over.

1371
01:37:59,352 --> 01:38:02,063
Are you tryin' to tell me
these are just walkin' outta the store ?

1372
01:38:02,146 --> 01:38:06,317
This is a Ferrari, the finest machinery

- Good-bye.

1525
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:51,110
Colonel, are you
looking at me ?

1526
01:50:53,988 --> 01:50:57,074
I'm blind, Charlie.

1527
01:51:01,996 --> 01:51:05,207
I'm gonna take a nap.

1528
01:51:06,792 --> 01:51:09,211
Too much fresh air.

1529
01:51:09,295 --> 01:51:11,881
It's probably
a good idea.

1530
01:51:13,174 --> 01:51:16,135
Want me to help you
to your room ?

1531
01:51:16,177 --> 01:51:18,512
No.

Couch.

1533
01:51:20,848 --> 01:51:24,143
I like
this couch here.

1534
01:51:26,103 --> 01:51:28,439
You sure you're
all right, Colonel ?

1535
01:51:28,522 --> 01:51:30,483
I got a headache.

1536

[ Sigh ]

1537

Why don't you go downstairs,
get me some Aspirin, Charlie ?

1538
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:44,038
- Some Aspirin.
- Yeah. Also...

1539
01:51:45,581 --> 01:51:48,709
I feel like
a cigar.

1540
01:51:48,793 --> 01:51:53,339
Get me a couple of
Monte Cristos, number one.

1541
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:55,883
- Monte Cristos, number one.
- Yeah.

1542
01:51:55,966 --> 01:51:58,803
You won't be able to get 'em
at the newsstand downstairs.

1543
01:51:58,886 --> 01:52:01,639
So why don't you
go over to...

Tell him, um,
they're for me.

1547

He'll know.

You're back
too fast.

1549

You didn't get
my cigars, did you ?

1550

Get out of here,
Charlie.

1551

I thought we had a deal.

1552
01:53:23,471 --> 01:53:28,893
I welched. I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you ?

1553
01:53:28,976 --> 01:53:32,521
No, what you told me was that
you gave me all the bullets.

1554
01:53:32,605 --> 01:53:35,065
I lied.

1555
01:53:36,859 --> 01:53:39,779
- Yeah, well, you could have fooled me.
- And I did.

1556
01:53:42,990 --> 01:53:46,577
Charlie, how you ever gonna survive
in this world without me ?

1557

Why don't you just
give me the gun, all right ?

Wh-- What are you doing ?

1559
01:54:06,680 --> 01:54:08,724
I'm gonna
shoot you too.

Your life's finished anyway.

1561

Your friend George's gonna
sing like a canary.

And so are you.

1563

And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1564
01:54:22,571 --> 01:54:26,742
you're gonna take your place
on that long, gray line...

of American manhood.

And you will be through.

1567
01:54:33,624 --> 01:54:35,960
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

1568
01:54:36,043 --> 01:54:38,963
You're in no position
to disagree with me, boy.

1569

I got a loaded .45 here.
You got pimples.

an ultimatum ?

important.

You got integrity, Charlie.

I don't know whether
to shoot ya or adopt ya.

1586

Not much of a choice,
is it, sir ?

Aw, don't get cute now.

- Colonel, please put the gun away ?
- I asked you a question.

Not an isolated case
of vandalism, what happened...

is a symptom
of the sickness of a society,

counter to the principles...

- disrespect for our values...

for our standards,

a disrespect for
the Baird tradition.

And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

I saw something,

1833

- You couldn't say or you wouldn't say ?

Well, I just --
I --

02:18:30,695 --> 02:18:33,197
- I just couldn't say. I'm --
- Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

1838

You're exhausting
my patience...

1839
02:18:35,241 --> 02:18:37,451
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

The consequences of your response
will be dire.

By dire I mean your future
will be jeopardized permanently.

"l saw somebody." Good.

their size and shape ?

Yeah.

And they were
the size and shape of whom ?

the size and shape --

02:27:22,894 --> 02:27:25,271
They have come
to a decision.

1985
02:27:25,354 --> 02:27:27,982
Misters Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson...

1986
02:27:28,065 --> 02:27:30,026
are placed
on probation...

1987
02:27:30,067 --> 02:27:33,905
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

1988
02:27:33,988 --> 02:27:37,283
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr....

1989
02:27:37,366 --> 02:27:40,578
receive neither recognition
nor commendation...

1990
02:27:40,661 --> 02:27:42,955
for his cooperation.

1991
02:27:43,039 --> 02:27:46,000
Mr. Charles Simms
is excused...

1992
02:27:46,083 --> 02:27:48,920
from any further response
to this incident.

1993
02:27:49,003 --> 02:27:51,631
- Whoo-ah.
- [ Cheering And Applause ]

1994
02:28:27,792 --> 02:28:29,877
Charlie !

1995
02:28:49,855 --> 02:28:54,026
- Last step.
- I can always count on you, Charlie.

1996
02:28:56,571 --> 02:28:58,864
[ Woman ]
Colonel.

1997
02:28:58,948 --> 02:29:00,950
Colonel !

1998
02:29:01,033 --> 02:29:03,160
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

1999
02:29:03,244 --> 02:29:05,162
I teach
Political Science.

2000
02:29:05,246 --> 02:29:07,456
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate...

2001
02:29:07,540 --> 02:29:10,084
- your coming here
and speaking your mind.
- Thank you. Are you married ?

2002
02:29:10,167 --> 02:29:13,004
Uh --
I, uh --

2003
02:29:14,630 --> 02:29:18,384
Went to a artillery school
at Fort Sill with a Mickey Downes.

2004
02:29:18,467 --> 02:29:20,386
Thought he might've
snagged you.

2005
02:29:20,469 --> 02:29:23,639
Uh, no, no,
I'm afraid not.

2006
02:29:23,723 --> 02:29:26,100
Uh, Colonel Slade was on, uh,

2007
02:29:26,183 --> 02:29:28,185
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

2008
02:29:28,269 --> 02:29:30,938
Were you ? Fascinating.

2009
02:29:31,022 --> 02:29:33,733
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2010
02:29:36,944 --> 02:29:38,863
Fleurs de rocailles.

2011
02:29:41,032 --> 02:29:42,992
Yes.

2012

"Flowers from a brook."

2013
02:29:47,330 --> 02:29:49,540
That's right.

2014
02:29:52,168 --> 02:29:54,795
Well, Miss Downes,

2015
02:29:54,837 --> 02:29:58,299
I, I'll know
where to find you.

2016
02:29:58,382 --> 02:30:00,343
Charlie.

2017
02:30:00,384 --> 02:30:02,637
- [ Charlie ] Bye, Miss Downes.
- Bye.

2018
02:30:05,556 --> 02:30:09,268
You don't have
to tell me, Charlie.

2019
02:30:09,352 --> 02:30:12,146
5'7",

auburn hair,

2021
02:30:14,941 --> 02:30:18,402
beautiful
brown eyes.

2022
02:30:35,795 --> 02:30:38,005
Yabba dabba doo.

2023
02:30:39,090 --> 02:30:41,050
Hah !

2024
02:30:42,385 --> 02:30:44,512
Manny.

2025
02:30:45,846 --> 02:30:47,765
Aw, Colonel,
this is too much.

2026
02:30:47,848 --> 02:30:50,560
You earned it.
Next time Charlie and l...

2027
02:30:50,643 --> 02:30:53,437
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2028
02:30:53,521 --> 02:30:55,439
You can drive us
both ways.

2029
02:30:55,523 --> 02:30:58,150
You're on. Not only
will it be an honor,

2030
02:30:58,234 --> 02:31:00,152
I'll give you
a rate.

2031
02:31:00,236 --> 02:31:02,989
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

2032
02:31:03,072 --> 02:31:05,032
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

2033
02:31:05,074 --> 02:31:08,202
- Take care, Colonel.
- You too.

2034
02:31:08,286 --> 02:31:11,747
- Ready ?
- No, thanks, Charlie.
I'll take it from here.

2035
02:31:11,789 --> 02:31:15,751
You go on ahead.
Manny'll drive you back to your dorm.

2036
02:31:15,835 --> 02:31:19,088
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

2037
02:31:19,171 --> 02:31:21,549
We'll have a little cheer.

2038
02:31:21,591 --> 02:31:24,385
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

2039
02:31:24,427 --> 02:31:27,013
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

2040
02:31:27,096 --> 02:31:29,015
It's almost edible.

2041
02:31:30,266 --> 02:31:32,184
All right, Colonel.

2042
02:31:32,268 --> 02:31:34,061
- That'd be really --
- Bye, Charlie.

2043
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:56,584
Who's there ?

2044
02:31:56,626 --> 02:31:59,128
- That you, Francine ?
- Yes.

2045
02:31:59,170 --> 02:32:02,465
- What are you doing ?
- Taking a ride.

2046
02:32:02,548 --> 02:32:05,927
Taking a ride ?
What about you giving me a lift ?

2047
02:32:06,010 --> 02:32:09,263
- No.
- No ?

2048
02:32:09,305 --> 02:32:11,891
Aw, come on,
Francine.

2049
02:32:11,974 --> 02:32:15,269
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up ?

2050
02:32:15,353 --> 02:32:17,730
- [ Francine ] No.
- [ Slade ] Francine ?

2051
02:32:17,813 --> 02:32:19,732
- What ?
- Your Uncle Frank's had himself...

2052
02:32:19,815 --> 02:32:24,403
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2053
02:32:24,487 --> 02:32:26,405
- [ Willie Muttering ]
- What's that ?

2054
02:32:26,489 --> 02:32:28,699
I hear a chipmunk.

2055
02:32:28,783 --> 02:32:30,743
Is it a walrus ?

2056
02:32:30,826 --> 02:32:32,745
No, it's Willie.

2057
02:32:32,828 --> 02:32:35,581
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag ?

2058
02:32:35,665 --> 02:32:38,501
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2059
02:32:38,584 --> 02:32:40,836
Come on. Come on.

2060
02:32:40,920 --> 02:32:43,714
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong.

2061
02:32:43,798 --> 02:32:45,967
Come on.

2062
02:32:47,176 --> 02:32:49,679
Here we are.

2063
02:32:49,762 --> 02:32:52,223
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

2064
02:32:52,306 --> 02:32:55,101
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2065
02:32:55,184 --> 02:32:57,937
- Whaddaya say ?
- Okay.
