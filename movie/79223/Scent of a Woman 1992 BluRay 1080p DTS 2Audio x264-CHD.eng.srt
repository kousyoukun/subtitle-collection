No, sir. On the contrary. I think it's great.

Should the headmaster of Baird be seen putt-putting around in some junker ?

How short, Harry ?

Along with the usual sheaf of applicants submitted by Baird,

320
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:23,606
of which virtually,

321
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:27,277
oh, two-thirds are guaranteed admittance,

322
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:30,780
I add one name,

323
00:25:30,864 --> 00:25:34,826
somebody who's a standout and yet, underprivileged;

324
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:40,748
a student who cannot afford to pay the board and tuition in Cambridge.

325
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,296
Do you know on whose behalf I drafted a memo this year ?

326
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:51,843
- No, sir. - You. You, Mr. Simms.

327
00:25:55,138 --> 00:25:57,348
Now can you tell me who did it ?

328
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:01,811
No, sir, I can't.

329
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:05,899
You take the weekend to think about it, Mr. Simms.

330
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:11,404
Good afternoon.

331
00:26:12,822 --> 00:26:15,116
What'd he say ?

332
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,368
- Nothin'. - What do you mean, nothing ?

333
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:19,787
He said the same thing. He just said it over.

334
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:21,915
You know what he's doing ?

335
00:26:21,998 --> 00:26:25,210
He's good-cop, bad-coppin' us.

336
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:27,504
He knows I'm old guard. You're fringe.

337
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:31,090
He's gonna bear down on me and soft-soap you.

338
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:35,887
[ Laughing ] Did he try to soft-soap you ? Did he ?

339
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,515
No.

340
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:41,684
Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse from you. Are you panicking ?

341
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:44,187
- Yeah, a little. - Come on.

342
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:47,607
- You're on scholarship, right ? - Yeah.

343
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,320
You're on scholarship from Oregon... at Baird.

344
00:26:52,403 --> 00:26:55,365
You're a long way from home, Chas.

345
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:57,742
What's that got to do with anything ?

346
00:26:57,784 --> 00:27:00,078
I don't know how it works out there.

347
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:03,706
But how it works here ? We stick together.

348
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,209
It's us against them, no matter what.

349
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:10,213
We don't cover our ass. We don't tell our parents.

350
00:27:10,296 --> 00:27:13,007
Stonewall everybody !

351
00:27:13,091 --> 00:27:17,720
And above all, never, never...

352
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:21,432
Leave any of us twisting in the wind.

353
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,519
And that's it.

354
00:27:24,602 --> 00:27:27,021
What does that have to do with me being on scholarship ?

355
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,399
Hey, hey !

356
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,944
I'm just tryin' to bring you up to speed, kid, that's it.

357
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:35,780
Thanks.

358
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:41,661
I'll tell you what. Give me a few hours to figure out the moves,

359
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:45,165
and call me tonight in Vermont.

360
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:48,501
I'll be at the Sugarbush lodge, all right ?

361
00:27:48,585 --> 00:27:51,171
All right.

362
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,715
You all right ?

363
00:27:53,798 --> 00:27:56,759
Yeah, I guess so.

364
00:27:56,801 --> 00:27:59,387
Okay.

365
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,057
Try to keep him down to four drinks a day.

366
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:05,977
If you can keep him down to forty, you're doin' good.

367
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:09,564
Try to water them down a little. Do you know how to do that ?

368
00:28:09,647 --> 00:28:14,152
- It's a long ride, honey ! - Get the bags in the car. I'll be right out.

369
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:18,531
Mommy, Mommy ! Don't forget Uncle Frank's walk.

370
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,700
[ Mrs. Rossi ] Oh, ha... Yeah.

371
00:28:20,783 --> 00:28:24,454
Uh, you have to air him out...

372
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,831
a little every day.

373
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,084
Why don't you go on back there, get yourself oriented ?

374
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:34,756
I'll come out in a minute, give you telephone numbers and stuff.

375
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,383
[ Frank ] Well, I wouldn't try a thing like that...

376
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,928
unless I knew, would I ?

377
00:28:40,011 --> 00:28:41,930
Just let me speak to her.

378
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,932
Hello, beautiful. Is that you ?

379
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:47,060
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

380
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:49,979
[ Chuckling ] You have a glass of wine with lunch ?

381
00:28:50,021 --> 00:28:53,608
You sound a little dusky. Hmm.

382
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:57,570
- [ Clearing Throat ] - Just a minute, sweetheart.

383
00:28:57,654 --> 00:29:01,199
You're back, huh ?

384
00:29:01,282 --> 00:29:02,826
Tenacious !

385
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:06,287
Get out my dress blues. They're in a garment bag in the closet.

386
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,414
Check the top dresser drawer. Take out the shoulder boards...

387
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,542
and affix them shoulders right and left,

388
00:29:10,625 --> 00:29:13,169
A.S.A.P. That means now.

389
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:15,213
Hello.

390
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:18,550
Sorry to keep you waitin', sweetheart.

391
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:21,094
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to rush things,

392
00:29:21,177 --> 00:29:26,891
but I'm catchin' a 4:00 at Logan, lookin' out my window, and there's not a taxi in sight.

393
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,310
What happened to Chet ?

394
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,437
He didn't invest in a radio yet ?

395
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,732
Hah ! Well, get your driver on it.

396
00:29:34,816 --> 00:29:38,444
Tell him to get a move on.

397
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:41,322
Yes. Mmm.

398
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:45,660
Some kind of body has got to go with that bedroom voice.

399
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:48,204
One day I'm gonna swing by, get a better look at it.

400
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,957
You bet.

401
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,959
Bye.

402
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,466
My val-pak's underneath the bed. Get it out.

403
00:29:59,549 --> 00:30:01,551
Put the boards on the blues and fold 'em in.

404
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:05,221
Uh, are we going someplace, Colonel ?

405
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,683
What business is that of yours ? Don't shrug, imbecile.

406
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:13,730
I'm blind. Save your body language for the bimbi.

407
00:30:13,771 --> 00:30:18,651
- Now, get my gear out. - Francine, get in the car.

408
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:23,031
It's almost 3:00. The goddamn Flintstones haven't left yet.

409
00:30:23,114 --> 00:30:28,161
[ Mr. Rossi ] Willie Rossi must go in the car !

410
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:31,956
- Here comes Mrs. Rossi now. - Damn it !

411
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:35,418
She said good-bye to me three times today.

412
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,629
What's she got, separation anxiety ?

413
00:30:37,712 --> 00:30:40,715
Cut her off at the door !

414
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:44,761
Hi, honey. Bye, honey.

415
00:30:47,347 --> 00:30:49,766
I wish you were coming with us.

416
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,101
Me too.

417
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:54,813
Maybe next time.

418
00:30:58,441 --> 00:31:00,985
- Drive carefully now. - Yeah.

419
00:31:03,196 --> 00:31:06,449
Charlie, this is where we'll be.

420
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:09,202
Good luck, Charlie. Don't let him drink too much.

421
00:31:11,554 --> 00:31:15,808
See ya, Charlie !

422
00:31:15,892 --> 00:31:19,562
And no 900 numbers. He loves to talk dirty.

423
00:31:26,569 --> 00:31:29,489
All right, let's get to work.

424
00:31:38,456 --> 00:31:41,084
L-buckles givin' you trouble ?

425
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:44,754
Never in the Boy Scouts, sluggo ?

426
00:31:44,796 --> 00:31:48,424
- I, I made Tenderfoot. - Tenderfoot, my foot !

427
00:31:48,508 --> 00:31:50,802
Convenience-store mama's boy.

428
00:31:50,885 --> 00:31:53,054
Here. Let me take a look at that.

429
00:31:53,096 --> 00:31:57,016
Touch me again, I'll kill ya, you little son-of-a-bitch !

430
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:03,439
I touch you. Understand ?

431
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:09,737
My shoulder boards are in the top dresser drawer. Get them, son.

432
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:13,992
The epaulets with the silver oak leaf.

433
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:33,094
- Are these -- - Good.

434
00:32:33,136 --> 00:32:35,638
Taxi come yet ?

435
00:32:35,722 --> 00:32:38,099
Colonel, where are we going ?

436
00:32:38,141 --> 00:32:40,101
Where we going ?

437
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,604
Freak show central.

438
00:32:42,645 --> 00:32:45,481
- Where's that ? - New York City.

439
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:49,903
That's in New York, son. New York State.

440
00:32:49,986 --> 00:32:54,324
Uh, Mrs. Rossi didn't say anything to me about going anywhere.

441
00:32:54,365 --> 00:32:56,534
She forgot.

442
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:59,662
- Should we call her, 'cause I -- - You kidding me ?

443
00:32:59,746 --> 00:33:03,541
Call her ? By the time they get to Albany in that "hupmobile" he drives...

444
00:33:03,625 --> 00:33:06,336
it'll be opening day at Saratoga.

445
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,423
- Colonel, I can't go to New York City. - Why not ?

446
00:33:10,506 --> 00:33:12,508
New York --

447
00:33:12,592 --> 00:33:16,262
- New York's too much responsibility. - Ah, responsibility !

448
00:33:16,346 --> 00:33:19,057
I had a lot of 17 year olds my first platoon.

449
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,477
I took care of them. All set !

450
00:33:23,728 --> 00:33:26,481
How do I look ?

451
00:33:26,522 --> 00:33:29,317
Tickets. Money.

452
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,319
Speech.

453
00:33:31,361 --> 00:33:34,989
Old Washington joke... from my days with Lyndon.

454
00:33:35,073 --> 00:33:38,993
-[ Honking ] -I knew I could count on transportation.

455
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:41,913
Are you ready ?

456
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:46,542
This is not Panmunjom. A simple yes will do.

457
00:33:46,584 --> 00:33:48,670
- Um -- - Good ! Here you go.

458
00:33:48,711 --> 00:33:51,589
Come on ! Hup to it, son !

459
00:33:51,673 --> 00:33:54,300
You're in front of me. Let's go.

460
00:33:54,384 --> 00:33:57,845
- [ Meowing ] - [ Frank ] Tomster, come here, boy.

461
00:33:57,887 --> 00:34:00,473
Psst, psst. Come on.

462
00:34:00,556 --> 00:34:04,561
Here, tomster, come on. Tomster, tomster. Yeah.

463
00:34:05,895 --> 00:34:10,858
Remember, when in doubt... fuck.

464
00:34:13,945 --> 00:34:16,531
Good afternoon, sir. Where's our destination ?

465
00:34:16,614 --> 00:34:19,534
Our destination... New York City, home of the brave !

466
00:34:19,576 --> 00:34:22,704
- Two for the shuttle to New York. - I'm not shuttling anywhere.

467
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:26,583
- Look at those tickets. "First class." - Yes, sir, first class.

468
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:30,461
You bought me a ticket ? I never said I'd go to New York.

469
00:34:30,545 --> 00:34:34,716
What are you, some kind of chicken-shit, sticks to job description only ?

470
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:36,718
Gate 46, sir.

471
00:34:36,759 --> 00:34:39,596
- As you were, son. - Thank you, sir.

472
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,223
Which way's the door ?

473
00:34:42,265 --> 00:34:46,352
- Are you blind ? Are you blind ? - Of course not.

474
00:34:46,436 --> 00:34:49,689
Then why do you keep grabbin' my goddamn arm ?

475
00:34:49,772 --> 00:34:53,151
I take your arm.

476
00:34:56,446 --> 00:34:58,489
- I'm sorry. - Don't be sorry.

477
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:01,242
How would you know, watchin' MTV all your life ?

478
00:35:01,451 --> 00:35:03,786
Yes !

479
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,916
- Jack Daniels... - You bet.

480
00:35:09,959 --> 00:35:13,212
- And Diet Slice. - The old Diet Slice.

481
00:35:13,296 --> 00:35:15,590
- And a water. - Thank you, Daphne.

482
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:17,550
Certainly, sir.

483
00:35:22,555 --> 00:35:24,599
Ahh ! Mmm !

484
00:35:24,682 --> 00:35:28,519
How did you know her name ?

485
00:35:28,603 --> 00:35:31,981
Well, she's wearin' Floris.

486
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:35,235
That's an English cologne.

487
00:35:35,318 --> 00:35:39,364
But her voice is California chickie.

488
00:35:39,447 --> 00:35:43,326
Now, California chickie bucking for English lady --

489
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:47,038
I call her Daphne.

490
00:35:47,121 --> 00:35:51,626
Oh, big things may happen to that little thing of yours.

491
00:35:53,044 --> 00:35:55,964
Look, Colonel,

492
00:35:56,005 --> 00:35:58,258
- I'll get you to New York, all right ? - Uh-huh.

493
00:35:58,341 --> 00:36:01,678
Then I'm gonna have to turn around and come back.

494
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:04,889
Well, Chuck, you gotta do what you gotta do.

495
00:36:04,973 --> 00:36:08,142
Charlie, all right ? Or Charles.

496
00:36:08,184 --> 00:36:10,478
Sorry. I can't blame you, though.

497
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,564
Chuck is a --

498
00:36:15,567 --> 00:36:18,278
So, why are we going to New York ?

499
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:21,906
All information will be given on a need-to-know basis.

500
00:36:23,741 --> 00:36:25,702
Whoo-ah !

501
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:27,954
Where's Daphne ? Let's get her down here.

502
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:32,166
She's in the back.

503
00:36:32,208 --> 00:36:35,795
A tail's in the tail.

504
00:36:35,878 --> 00:36:37,839
Hah !

505
00:36:37,922 --> 00:36:41,050
Oh, but I still smell her. [ Sniffing ]

506
00:36:43,386 --> 00:36:45,888
Women !

507
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:49,058
What can you say ?

508
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:51,728
Who made 'em ?

509
00:36:51,811 --> 00:36:53,938
God must have been a fuckin' genius.

510
00:36:58,735 --> 00:37:01,362
The hair --

511
00:37:01,404 --> 00:37:05,533
They say the hair is everything, you know.

512
00:37:05,617 --> 00:37:09,704
Have you ever buried your nose in a mountain of curls...

513
00:37:09,787 --> 00:37:14,626
and just wanted to go to sleep forever ?

514
00:37:14,709 --> 00:37:18,421
Or lips --

515
00:37:18,504 --> 00:37:20,548
and when they touched, yours were like...

516
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:24,385
that first swallow of wine...

517
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:26,763
after you just crossed the desert.

518
00:37:30,391 --> 00:37:33,937
Tits ! Whoo-ah !

519
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,398
Big ones, little ones,

520
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,859
nipples staring right out at ya...

521
00:37:39,943 --> 00:37:42,904
Like secret searchlights.

522
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:45,865
Mmm.

523
00:37:46,783 --> 00:37:49,577
And legs --

524
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:52,914
I don't care if they're Greek columns...

525
00:37:52,956 --> 00:37:56,417
or secondhand Steinways.

526
00:37:56,459 --> 00:37:59,837
What's between 'em,

527
00:37:59,921 --> 00:38:02,423
passport to heaven.

528
00:38:03,216 --> 00:38:05,260
I need a drink.

529
00:38:08,972 --> 00:38:12,267
Yes, Mr. Simms,

530
00:38:12,308 --> 00:38:17,272
there's only two syllables in this whole wide world worth hearing:

531
00:38:21,192 --> 00:38:23,152
pussy.

532
00:38:23,987 --> 00:38:25,905
Hah !

533
00:38:25,989 --> 00:38:29,117
Are you listening to me, son ? I'm givin' you pearls here.

534
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,996
I guess you really like women.

535
00:38:33,037 --> 00:38:36,666
Oh, above all things !

536
00:38:41,504 --> 00:38:45,174
A very, very distant second...

537
00:38:46,968 --> 00:38:49,762
is a Ferrari.

538
00:38:55,977 --> 00:38:58,980
Charlie ?

539
00:38:59,063 --> 00:39:01,232
Give me your hand.

540
00:39:03,443 --> 00:39:06,571
This is just the start of your education, son.

541
00:39:22,337 --> 00:39:24,297
Whoo-ah !

542
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,383
- Where are we ? - Where are we, eh ?

543
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:30,803
The cynosure of all things civilized:

544
00:39:30,887 --> 00:39:32,931
the Waldorf-Astoria.

545
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:37,393
The last time I was here, Charlie, was with a G-2 from Brussels.

546
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:39,395
Had a Ferrari.

547
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:42,607
Every day I held the door open for the fucker.

548
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,692
Never even offered me a ride.

549
00:39:44,776 --> 00:39:46,736
Well, fuck him.

550
00:39:46,778 --> 00:39:49,197
He's dead and I'm blind.

551
00:39:52,951 --> 00:39:55,245
- Spread the word. - Thank you, sir.

552
00:39:55,286 --> 00:39:58,873
- The intelligence will be forthcoming ? - Sir ?

553
00:39:58,915 --> 00:40:00,917
On the escort scene.

554
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,503
Um, yes, sir.

555
00:40:03,586 --> 00:40:07,090
- And welcome to the Waldorf. - Gracias, amigo.

556
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:12,053
Puerto Ricans... always made the best infantrymen.

557
00:40:17,809 --> 00:40:21,604
- [ Clanking ] - Oh !

558
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:29,946
I'm home again.

559
00:40:30,029 --> 00:40:33,157
Give me an inventory on this, will you ?

560
00:40:38,371 --> 00:40:40,540
All right, where am l, in Asia ?

561
00:40:40,623 --> 00:40:43,501
He told me the phone was on the other side of the room, didn't he ?

562
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:46,296
By the windows ?

563
00:40:46,337 --> 00:40:49,340
It's right here.

564
00:40:49,424 --> 00:40:51,467
Okay.

565
00:40:51,551 --> 00:40:53,886
We're in business.

566
00:40:57,807 --> 00:40:59,976
Get me the Oak Room.

567
00:41:00,018 --> 00:41:02,186
How's that inventory comin' ?

568
00:41:04,147 --> 00:41:09,152
Uh, there's Jim Beam and Early Times.

569
00:41:09,235 --> 00:41:12,155
Quartermaster's on the take again. Hello.

570
00:41:12,196 --> 00:41:16,159
Is Sheldon or Mack there ?

571
00:41:16,242 --> 00:41:18,661
This is Lt. Col. Frank Slade.

572
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:24,500
I used to be a regular. I used to come in with a General Garbisch.

573
00:41:24,584 --> 00:41:28,004
Yes, that's probably because he's at Arlington six feet under.

574
00:41:28,046 --> 00:41:32,383
Listen up. I want a table for two, and I don't mean Siberia, 8:15.

575
00:41:33,843 --> 00:41:36,387
Clear them little bottles off.

576
00:41:36,471 --> 00:41:39,557
And when I get off the phone, call up Hyman.

577
00:41:39,641 --> 00:41:42,560
Tell him I want it wall to wall with John Daniels.

578
00:41:42,644 --> 00:41:45,813
Uh, don't you mean, uh, Jack Daniels ?

579
00:41:45,855 --> 00:41:49,609
He may be Jack to you, son. But when you've known him as long as I have --

580
00:41:49,692 --> 00:41:51,194
That's a joke. Hello !

581
00:41:51,277 --> 00:41:55,657
This is Lt. Col. Frank Slade. I would like a limo, 8:00.

582
00:42:01,704 --> 00:42:03,831
What are you drinkin' ?

583
00:42:03,873 --> 00:42:07,585
Uh, nothing, thanks. I don't use it.

584
00:42:07,669 --> 00:42:10,672
What's useful about it ?

585
00:42:10,755 --> 00:42:14,550
I don't know. Listen, Colonel, I have to get going.

586
00:42:14,592 --> 00:42:16,678
Where you goin' ?

587
00:42:16,761 --> 00:42:20,515
Back to school. I've got some real important stuff I have to take care of.

588
00:42:22,225 --> 00:42:24,686
Very well.

589
00:42:24,727 --> 00:42:27,897
But I never let my aides leave on an empty stomach.

590
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:31,067
You'll dine with me and then my driver will transport you...

591
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:34,696
to the airport for the Boston Shuttle departing at 2200 hours.

592
00:42:36,197 --> 00:42:39,576
Meanwhile, unpack my bag.

593
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,744
I'm gonna christen the latrine.

594
00:42:43,246 --> 00:42:45,415
[ Frank ] What's your name, driver ?

595
00:42:45,498 --> 00:42:48,167
- Manny, sir. - Manny.

596
00:42:48,251 --> 00:42:51,879
The bellhops at the Waldorf, are they any good at getting escorts ?

597
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:55,550
- I wouldn't know, sir. - What would you know ?

598
00:42:55,592 --> 00:42:59,095
- About what ? - About you-know-what ?

599
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,099
Maybe I could manage something.

600
00:43:03,182 --> 00:43:06,311
[ Frank ] I'm talkin' top of the line, now.

601
00:43:06,394 --> 00:43:08,646
Let me think about this, sir.

602
00:43:16,279 --> 00:43:18,323
What's the matter with you ?

603
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:23,202
- With me ? - Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why ?

604
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:26,789
You got the fuckin' weight of the world on your shoulders.

605
00:43:27,790 --> 00:43:30,501
[ Sigh ]

606
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:33,004
I got a little problem at school, that's all.

607
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:36,007
- Spit it out ! - It's not a big deal, all right ?

608
00:43:36,090 --> 00:43:38,009
Where we going, the Oak Room or somethin' ?

609
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:40,762
If it's not a big deal, why did you say "real important stuff" ?

610
00:43:40,803 --> 00:43:45,016
What are you doin', banging the dean's daughter ? Hah !

611
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,313
- I'm just in a little trouble. - What kind of trouble ?

612
00:43:50,396 --> 00:43:53,608
I saw some guys doing something.

613
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:58,321
To tell or not to tell, or it's your ass.

614
00:43:58,404 --> 00:44:00,323
Hmm ?

615
00:44:02,408 --> 00:44:04,535
- How'd you know that ? - I'm a wizard.

616
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:07,163
Give me the details, come on.

617
00:44:09,165 --> 00:44:12,627
[ Sigh ]

618
00:44:12,710 --> 00:44:14,796
There's this guy at school named Harry.

619
00:44:14,837 --> 00:44:16,965
He's this real rich kid.

620
00:44:17,006 --> 00:44:19,217
He like... runs the show.

621
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,928
Who else ?

622
00:44:22,011 --> 00:44:26,224
There's another guy, George, but George didn't do anything.

623
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:30,186
George and I saw Harry and his buddies doin' somethin'.

624
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,313
Now, the folks at Baird,

625
00:44:32,397 --> 00:44:35,525
they know you and George can identify the guilty parties ?

626
00:44:38,444 --> 00:44:40,530
Yeah, they think we can.

627
00:44:40,613 --> 00:44:45,368
- George is a friend of yours. - He's not a friend, but he's all right.

628
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,038
- You trust him ? - Yeah, I guess so.

629
00:44:49,122 --> 00:44:54,043
- He's on scholarship too ? - No, why ?

630
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:57,505
We got George, we got Harry, we got trouble.

631
00:44:57,547 --> 00:45:00,383
They're rich, you're poor. You wanna get rich.

632
00:45:00,466 --> 00:45:03,845
You wanna graduate Baird, become a rich big shot like them.

633
00:45:03,886 --> 00:45:07,015
- Am I right ? - No. It's not that way at all.

634
00:45:07,098 --> 00:45:09,309
Okay, Charlie !

635
00:45:11,185 --> 00:45:13,688
Here we are, gentlemen: the Oak Room.

636
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:16,149
The Oak Room !

637

Uh, tell me now, Charlie.

797
00:55:15,331 --> 00:55:19,294
This, uh, George Willis, Junior, what's his father do ?

798
00:55:19,377 --> 00:55:21,421
I don't really know.

799
00:55:21,504 --> 00:55:24,048
Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

800
00:55:24,132 --> 00:55:28,886
When George Willis, Sr., isn't busy as a million-dollar man for Aetna Casualty --

801
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,390
or is it New England Distributor for the Chrysler Corporation ?

802
00:55:32,473 --> 00:55:36,477
He concerns himself with his young son, George Willis, Junior.

803
00:55:36,561 --> 00:55:39,898
George isn't going to say anything to his father.

804
00:55:39,939 --> 00:55:42,233
Oh, Charlie.

805
00:55:42,275 --> 00:55:44,485
Big George is gonna wind up Little George,

806
00:55:44,569 --> 00:55:47,697
and Little George is gonna sing like a canary.

807
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:50,283
And if you're hip, kid, you're gonna hop to, too.

808
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:52,452
You've got this all figured out, don't you ?

809
00:55:52,535 --> 00:55:56,915
It don't take no Young America merit scholarship to figure this one out.

810
00:55:56,998 --> 00:56:00,877
Charlie, you had a little life, so you decided to go to Baird...

811
00:56:00,919 --> 00:56:04,005
to put yourself in the market for a big one.

812
00:56:04,088 --> 00:56:06,049
Now, in order to stay in the running,

813
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:08,968
you're gonna have to tell these people what they want to know.

814
00:56:09,052 --> 00:56:11,220
You think so ?

815
00:56:11,304 --> 00:56:13,264
- Are we finished, Sofia ? - Yes.

816
00:56:13,306 --> 00:56:16,184
Grazie. Grazie.

817
00:56:17,977 --> 00:56:20,563
Charlie,

818
00:56:20,605 --> 00:56:23,483
if you don't sing now,

819
00:56:23,566 --> 00:56:26,861
you're gonna end up, not only shelving biscuits...

820
00:56:26,945 --> 00:56:29,906
in some convenience store in the Oregon burbs,

821
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:34,202
probably the last word you'll ever hear yourself say just before you croak...

822
00:56:34,285 --> 00:56:38,248
gonna be, "Have a nice day and come back soon."

823
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:40,500
Sofia !

824
00:56:40,583 --> 00:56:44,545
Measure up Charlie, pronto. We got a date for Thanksgiving.

825
00:56:44,629 --> 00:56:46,631
We got a date ?

826
00:56:46,714 --> 00:56:48,883
My brother's place.

827
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:51,719
W.R. Slade, White Plains, New York.

828
00:56:51,803 --> 00:56:55,265
Colonel, I can't go with you to your brother's place.

829
00:56:55,306 --> 00:56:58,101
I mean, I should be getting back to school.

830
00:57:00,478 --> 00:57:04,941
Uh, well you gotta have Thanksgiving somewhere.

831
00:57:05,024 --> 00:57:08,820
I mean, eats and treats. I could use the company.

832
00:57:12,448 --> 00:57:15,368
All right. D-Does he know I'm comin' ?

833
00:57:15,451 --> 00:57:18,371
He doesn't know I'm comin'. But wait till you see the look on his face...

834
00:57:18,454 --> 00:57:20,373
when I walk through the door.

835
00:57:20,456 --> 00:57:23,126
Oh, he loves me !

836
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,339
Oh, uh, Charlie, about your little problem,

837
00:57:28,423 --> 00:57:30,925
there are two kinds of people in this world:

838
00:57:31,009 --> 00:57:33,428
those who stand up and face the music,

839
00:57:33,511 --> 00:57:35,430
and those who run for cover.

840
00:57:35,513 --> 00:57:39,100
Cover's better. Okay, Sofia, suit 'im up !

841
00:57:39,183 --> 00:57:42,812
Make him pretty !

842
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,121
Careful.

843
00:58:00,163 --> 00:58:03,082
- Should I ring it ? - Yeah.

844
00:58:09,631 --> 00:58:11,633
Yes ?

845
00:58:11,716 --> 00:58:14,177
Yes ! Who is this ?

846
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:18,640
- It's Randy. - Randy ? You new ?

847
00:58:18,681 --> 00:58:20,850
I'm your nephew.

848
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:23,603
Hah ! Here I am !

849
00:58:23,686 --> 00:58:26,856
Your sister's been hoarding me long enough.

850
00:58:26,940 --> 00:58:29,859
- Thought it's time to spread the riches around. - Uncle Frank !

851
00:58:29,943 --> 00:58:31,903
- Gloria ! - Gail.

852
00:58:31,986 --> 00:58:33,905
Of course.

853
00:58:33,988 --> 00:58:37,450
Say hello to the potluck party from New York City.

854
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:40,578
Good old Uncle Frank and this here with him is Charlie Simms,

855
00:58:40,662 --> 00:58:42,956
star halfback of the Baird football team.

856
00:58:42,997 --> 00:58:47,252
They not only beat Exeter and Groton, but Aquinas High School too.

857
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:49,837
Where's your miserable father ?

858
00:58:49,921 --> 00:58:52,465
Wait ! No, no. Let's surprise him.

859
00:58:52,507 --> 00:58:55,593
Give that fat heart of his an attack. Willie !

860
00:58:57,887 --> 00:59:00,765
Oh, Willie !

861
00:59:11,109 --> 00:59:13,111
Hello, Frank.

862
00:59:13,194 --> 00:59:16,573
- How you doin' ? - Okay.

863
00:59:16,656 --> 00:59:21,452
Here's my hand. Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

864
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:23,580
Nice to meet you, sir.

865
00:59:23,663 --> 00:59:26,541
The original bulging briefcase man.

866
00:59:26,624 --> 00:59:31,045
Gretchen, I smell those prunes ! We talkin' Turkey Marbella ?

867
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:33,840
- Yes, we are. - Whoo !

868
00:59:33,923 --> 00:59:36,593
Let's have a whiff. Come on.

869
00:59:36,676 --> 00:59:38,636
You know, I always had a sneaker for you. Come here.

870
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:40,847
[ Sniffing ] Mmm.

871
00:59:40,930 --> 00:59:42,890
Hah !

872
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:47,186
- Where are you, Garry ? I heard you cough. - Who are you again ?

873
00:59:47,228 --> 00:59:51,858
I'm just here at the Waldorf-Astoria with -- Is it your brother ?

874
00:59:51,941 --> 00:59:54,402
W.R.'s final issue. How ya doin' ?

875
00:59:54,444 --> 00:59:59,532
- Yes. Who the hell are you ? - I'm kinda takin' care of him for the weekend.

876
00:59:59,616 --> 01:00:00,742
Charlie !

877
01:00:00,825 --> 01:00:03,036
Jesus !

878
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:07,624
Sorry. Where's the booze ? Flowin' like mud here.

879
01:00:07,707 --> 01:00:11,961
To tell the truth, the colonel's not well, I don't think.

880
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:15,131
- Not well ? - I think he's a little lonely.

881
01:00:15,214 --> 01:00:18,092
Why didn't you take him to your family's for dinner ?

882
01:00:18,176 --> 01:00:20,803
I heard that !

883
01:00:20,887 --> 01:00:23,264
I heard that.

884
01:00:23,348 --> 01:00:25,975
Pay no attention to him. That's his big-brother talk.

885
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:28,728
He's been watching out for me since day one.

886
01:00:28,770 --> 01:00:33,316
Bailed me out of more trouble... than he'd like to remember.

887
01:00:33,399 --> 01:00:35,902
- Hmm ? - [ Gretchen ] Let me take your coat.

888
01:00:35,985 --> 01:00:40,448
I meant to pick up some vino on my way, but I blew it.

889
01:00:40,531 --> 01:00:42,992
I'll send you the Rothschild again for Christmas,

890
01:00:43,076 --> 01:00:46,996
- only let's see how Thanksgiving goes. - I'll set two more places.

891
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,416
- Here's your drink, Frank. - Thank you, Randy.

892
01:00:50,458 --> 01:00:53,086
Still with Snow Queen sugar ?

893
01:00:53,127 --> 01:00:56,965
Snow Flake. Why do you always get that wrong ?

894
01:00:57,048 --> 01:01:00,343
Because it's not important for me to get it right. What are you doing there ?

895
01:01:00,426 --> 01:01:03,680
I'm Vice President for Marketing.

896
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:07,725
Whoo-ah ! Congratulations ! Sugar is shit, though.

897
01:01:07,809 --> 01:01:11,229
I told General Abrams to install honey in the commissaries.

898
01:01:11,312 --> 01:01:14,607
If the K-50s didn't blow your brains out, sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

899
01:01:16,192 --> 01:01:18,528
- Why don't we all sit down ? - Ooh !

900
01:01:18,611 --> 01:01:22,532
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie. Be careful.

901
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:26,578
- When the wife gets restless, the wife gets racy. - Let's go and eat.

902
01:01:26,661 --> 01:01:31,583
By all means. Thank you, Charlie.

903
01:01:31,666 --> 01:01:35,795
Where you wanna sit, Frank, or you gonna arrange yourself at the head again ?

904
01:01:35,878 --> 01:01:40,133
Any old card table will do. This is fine.

905
01:01:40,216 --> 01:01:43,469
[ Frank ] Where was I ? Oh !

906
01:01:43,511 --> 01:01:46,931
I wake up. It's four in the morning. I don't know who I'm with,

907
01:01:47,015 --> 01:01:49,225
why I'm there and where I am.

908
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:52,270
What am I gonna do ? I got this Asian flower,

909
01:01:52,353 --> 01:01:56,816
all giggly and dewy-like;

910
01:01:56,900 --> 01:02:00,778
and this hard-boiled navy nurse outta Omaha, on the other.

911
01:02:00,862 --> 01:02:05,158
We're three across the bed, not a stitch of clothes on.

912
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:07,619
It comes to me.

913
01:02:07,702 --> 01:02:12,290
Let east meet west. We'll build a golden bridge.

914
01:02:12,373 --> 01:02:14,083
[ Frank ] Hah-hah !

915
01:02:14,167 --> 01:02:16,836
I felt like I'd just joined the corps of engineers !

916
01:02:21,716 --> 01:02:24,385
We all still here ?

917
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:27,889
It's a beautiful story. [ Cough ]

918
01:02:30,099 --> 01:02:34,687
- Do you always enjoy shocking people, Uncle Frank ? - Honey.

919
01:02:34,771 --> 01:02:37,065
I didn't know you were so easily shocked.

920
01:02:37,148 --> 01:02:39,692
I admire your sensibilities. I'm touched.

921
01:02:39,776 --> 01:02:42,820
Dad, remember the time you persuaded Frank...

922
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:46,241
- to go to the kennel ? - What about it ?

923
01:02:46,324 --> 01:02:49,619
- He almost put the seeing eye dog business outta business. - Cool it, Randy.

924
01:02:49,702 --> 01:02:53,873
- It's over and done with. - Indeed it is, Garry.

925
01:02:53,957 --> 01:02:56,292
Indeed it is. So is dinner.

926
01:02:56,376 --> 01:02:59,462
Charlie, what time do you have ? I think we better be gettin' back.

927
01:02:59,545 --> 01:03:04,467
- You ever given any thought to a braille watch, Frank ? - Randy.

928
01:03:04,550 --> 01:03:08,513
- Stevie Wonder wears one, or do you rank on him too ? - Honey, please.

929
01:03:08,596 --> 01:03:10,890
It's all right, Gloria. I enjoy Randy's observations.

930
01:03:10,932 --> 01:03:14,894
My wife's name is Gail, Frank. Can you hear that ? Gail.

931
01:03:14,978 --> 01:03:17,438
Excuse me. Gail.

932
01:03:17,522 --> 01:03:21,276
Gail strikes me as a very beautiful woman,

933
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:23,945
but there's a little tension in her voice.

934
01:03:24,028 --> 01:03:26,823
It could be one of two things:

935
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:29,284
either Gail is nervous or unsatisfied.

936
01:03:29,993 --> 01:03:33,830
What's your point, Uncle Frank ?

937
01:03:33,830 --> 01:03:36,165
You oughta go down on her.

938
01:03:36,207 --> 01:03:38,334
Cut it out, Frank, will ya ?

939
01:03:38,418 --> 01:03:41,796
You're so wrapped up in sugar, you've forgotten the taste of real honey !

940
01:03:41,838 --> 01:03:43,715
Frank, for God's sake !

941
01:03:43,798 --> 01:03:46,426
Hear that voice ? There's fire under that dress.

942
01:03:46,509 --> 01:03:48,595
- Will you cut it out ? - Just get the fuck outta here.

943
01:03:48,678 --> 01:03:51,097
- Whoo-ah ! - Get in your limousine.

944
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,350
Go down to the bowery, get with the other fucking drunks where you belong !

945
01:03:54,434 --> 01:03:56,603
- Wait a minute. - What ?

946
01:03:56,686 --> 01:03:59,647
- Could you take it easy ? - What for ?

947
01:03:59,689 --> 01:04:02,191
You want me to lay off him, Chuckie, 'cause he's blind ?

948
01:04:02,275 --> 01:04:05,236
- No, but I mean -- - My friend's name is Charles.

949
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:07,822
He doesn't like to be called Chuckie.

950
01:04:07,864 --> 01:04:11,534
- This is supposed to be a family get-together. This is -- - A warning.

Jesus Christ. Another sucker who thinks this shitheel's a war hero.

952
01:04:15,872 --> 01:04:18,750
Whoo-ah.

953
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:23,379
Well, once... maybe.

954
01:04:23,463 --> 01:04:27,383
I suppose he told you about his days on Lyndon Johnson's staff ?

955
01:04:27,467 --> 01:04:30,053
I was gonna go. Now I'm not leaving.

956
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:33,848
- Frank was earmarked for general. - Earmarked, good word.

957
01:04:33,932 --> 01:04:38,102
- But Frank likes to spit in everybody's eye ! - Randy, that's enough.

958
01:04:38,186 --> 01:04:42,565
So -- What do they call it when they give you the shaft in the military ?

959
01:04:42,649 --> 01:04:47,111
- Passed over ! - Frank was passed over for promotion...

960
01:04:47,195 --> 01:04:50,615
Couple times.

961
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:55,787
- You want to know what happened then ? - Will you shut your mouth ?

962
01:04:55,870 --> 01:05:00,708
- He blew himself up. - Stop it, Randy.

963
01:05:00,750 --> 01:05:04,170
Our colonel, here, had a grenade juggling act at Fort Bragg or wherever.

964
01:05:04,254 --> 01:05:07,548
- Fort Benning. - He was teaching hand-to-hand combat --

965
01:05:07,632 --> 01:05:11,261
Randy, look at me when you're talking to me, son.

966
01:05:11,344 --> 01:05:15,848
I'm lookin', Frank. His partner in the act was some captain.

967
01:05:15,932 --> 01:05:18,560
- Major Vincent Squires. - Yeah, whoever he was.

968
01:05:18,643 --> 01:05:22,146
Before going on, they'd have themselves a lo-cal breakfast:

969
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,148
a Screwdriver for Frank, Bloody Mary for his partner.

970
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:26,067
No, Vincent drank Sea Breezes.

971
01:05:26,150 --> 01:05:29,445
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col. Slade had four to his partner's one.

972
01:05:29,445 --> 01:05:31,656
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col. Slade had four to his partner's one.

973
01:05:31,739 --> 01:05:34,242
He's flying in class. He gets all excited.

974
01:05:34,284 --> 01:05:36,953
He starts pulling the pins out.

975
01:05:38,955 --> 01:05:41,583
[ Randy ] One grenade got away from him.

976
01:05:41,624 --> 01:05:44,627
Boom.

977
01:05:46,296 --> 01:05:48,214
The one that got away.

978
01:05:48,298 --> 01:05:52,260
Oh, the pin was in... Frank claims.

979
01:05:52,302 --> 01:05:54,220
In or out, what difference does it make ?

980
01:05:54,304 --> 01:05:56,514
What kind of fucking lunatic juggles grenades ?

981
01:05:56,598 --> 01:05:59,100
Vinnie came out okay.

982
01:05:59,142 --> 01:06:01,728
And all Frank lost was his eyesight.

983
01:06:04,981 --> 01:06:08,443
- Wanna know the truth ? - You got a handle on that, do you, Randy ?

984
01:06:08,526 --> 01:06:11,613
- He was an asshole before. - Whoo-ah !

985
01:06:11,654 --> 01:06:15,491
Now all he is is a blind asshole.

986
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:17,619
Whoo-ah.

987
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:27,128
Hey, God's a funny guy.

988
01:06:27,211 --> 01:06:32,300
God doth have a sense of humor.

989
01:06:32,342 --> 01:06:37,347
Maybe God thinks some people don't deserve to see.

990
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,934
[ Sigh ] Whoo-ah. Hah !

You get the point... Chuckie ?

01:06:49,609 --> 01:06:51,986
- Aah ! - His name is Charles.

993
01:06:53,154 --> 01:06:55,323
You can say that, can't you ? Charles.

994
01:06:55,365 --> 01:06:59,577
Know what this is, Randy ? It's a choke hold I'm teaching those lieutenants.

995
01:06:59,661 --> 01:07:03,998
- Little pressure, I bust your windpipe. - I don't care what he said.

996
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:07,377
- Charles. - Just let go, please !

You outdid yourself.

1000

If you twist my arm hard enough,

1001
01:07:36,489 --> 01:07:39,450
we're talking Turkey Marbella next year.

1002

Frank ?

1004
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:51,546
Good-bye, Willie.

1005
01:07:56,217 --> 01:08:00,221
I'm no fucking good...

1006

and I never have been.

1007
01:08:08,271 --> 01:08:11,608
Come on, Charlie, get the coats.

1008
01:08:17,238 --> 01:08:21,117
Come on. Watch your step.

1009
01:08:21,993 --> 01:08:24,996
Hold it.

1010
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:41,554

[ Clinking ]

1012
01:09:25,682 --> 01:09:27,767
You got a watch ?

1013
01:09:30,853 --> 01:09:33,106
Ah, it's 7:20.

1014
01:09:33,189 --> 01:09:37,151
I didn't ask you the time. I asked if you had a watch.

1015
01:09:37,193 --> 01:09:39,320
Yeah, in the other room.

1016
01:09:39,362 --> 01:09:41,990
Get it.

1017
01:09:44,367 --> 01:09:47,120
Colonel, there's a clock right next to your bed.

1018
01:09:48,871 --> 01:09:51,332
Does it have a second hand ?

1019
01:09:56,504 --> 01:09:58,506
Yeah.

1020
01:09:58,548 --> 01:10:00,883
Time me !

1021
01:10:27,368 --> 01:10:29,370
How long ?

1022
01:10:30,914 --> 01:10:34,542
Um... about 30 seconds.

1023
01:10:34,584 --> 01:10:38,755
- I'm rusty. - Where did you get a gun, Colonel ?

1024
01:10:38,838 --> 01:10:41,716
Piece or weapon, Charlie, never a gun.

1025
01:10:44,594 --> 01:10:46,971
Where did you get the piece ?

1026
01:10:47,055 --> 01:10:51,517
I'm an officer in the United States Army. This is my sidearm.

1027
01:10:51,601 --> 01:10:55,939
- But you're not an officer anymore. - So I'm retired, so what ?

1028
01:10:55,980 --> 01:10:59,317
An officer never relinquishes his 45.

1029
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:03,321
Yeah, but you better relinquish it to me or I'm gonna call Mrs. Rossi.

1030
01:11:03,404 --> 01:11:05,073
Good idea.

1031
01:11:05,156 --> 01:11:07,742
Then I'm going back to school.

1032
01:11:07,784 --> 01:11:10,453
Even better. Blue skies, green lights.

I hope you have a wonderful trip. That felt like 25.

You oughta be able to do a 45 in 25. Did you time me ?

No, I did not and I'm calling Albany.

Mmm.

For what ?

1048
01:12:19,898 --> 01:12:23,985
One last tour of the battlefield.

1049
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:30,116
I can get around a city like New York,

1050

but l...

What do you say, Charlie ?

1053

What's one day... between friends ?

1054
01:12:47,216 --> 01:12:50,178
All right. Well, say I stay for another day.

1055
01:12:50,261 --> 01:12:52,513
Will you give me your weapon ?

1056
01:12:52,555 --> 01:12:56,643
Oh, Charlie ! I'm a lieutenant colonel, United States Army.

I'm not giving my fucking gun to anyone.

- Now, what are you drinkin' ? - Colonel, this -- this is unacceptable.

Unacceptable ? What are you givin' me that prep school crap for ?

01:13:08,821 --> 01:13:12,325
What have they done, taken the Oregon out of the boy ?

1061

Put in Harvard Business School ?

1062
01:13:14,494 --> 01:13:17,080
Then give me your bullets.

1063
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:28,258
You do see the sense of it, Charlie, don't you ?

1064
01:13:29,842 --> 01:13:33,096
I can't chew the leather anymore.

1065
01:13:33,179 --> 01:13:35,807
So, why should I share...

the tribe's provisions ?

1067
01:13:40,228 --> 01:13:42,689
I mean, there's no one...

1068
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:47,193

About what ?

1075
01:14:21,102 --> 01:14:25,106
About whether I blow my brains out or not.

1076
01:14:28,943 --> 01:14:33,072
- Because I have a conscience, you know. - You have a conscience.

Do we follow the rich boy's code or not ?

Yeah.

01:16:53,463 --> 01:16:56,716
Course you don't. They're all assholes.

1111
01:16:56,758 --> 01:16:59,802
Be a pleasure to squeal on 'em, wouldn't it ?

1112
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:04,307
- Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer. - "I'm not a squealer."

1113
01:17:04,390 --> 01:17:06,476
What is this, the Dreyfus case ?

1114
01:17:10,939 --> 01:17:13,107
Ohh ! Ooh, Mama !

1115
01:17:13,191 --> 01:17:15,443
There you go.

1116
01:17:15,526 --> 01:17:18,446
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1117
01:17:18,529 --> 01:17:20,490
Watch your step.

1118
01:17:23,409 --> 01:17:26,788
I'm gettin' that heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1119
01:17:29,499 --> 01:17:33,503
There's more to this, isn't there ?

1120
01:17:33,586 --> 01:17:35,672
Isn't there ?

1121
01:17:38,049 --> 01:17:41,886
- I was offered a bribe. - Oh, now we're cookin'.

1122
01:17:43,471 --> 01:17:46,099
Mr. Trask, the headmaster,

1123
01:17:47,141 --> 01:17:49,978
he promised to get me into Harvard.

1124
01:17:50,019 --> 01:17:53,314
- If you squeal. - Yeah.

1125
01:17:53,398 --> 01:17:55,692
What a dilemma.

1126
01:17:55,775 --> 01:18:01,155
Should Charlie Simms accept a free ride into Harvard or not ?

1127
01:18:01,239 --> 01:18:05,326
What do you think your friend George would do if he were in your shoes ?

1128
01:18:05,410 --> 01:18:07,495
- He is, practically. - How ?

1129
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:12,333
I mean, it's just that Mr. Trask hasn't promised to get him into Harvard.

1130
01:18:12,417 --> 01:18:16,671
Mr. Trask doesn't have to. George's father's gonna take care of that.

1131
01:18:18,756 --> 01:18:21,551
Do the deal, Charlie. Take it !

1132
01:18:21,634 --> 01:18:24,095
Go to Harvard.

1133
01:18:24,178 --> 01:18:27,015
- I can't do that. - Why not ?

1134
01:18:28,933 --> 01:18:32,395
It's just some things you just can't do.

1135
01:18:32,478 --> 01:18:34,856
Explain 'em to me.

1136
01:18:35,899 --> 01:18:40,653
- Louder, please. - I, l, I can't --

1137
01:18:40,695 --> 01:18:43,907
You're gonna have a tough time in this world, Charlie.

1138
01:18:45,241 --> 01:18:49,704
To ease the blow, let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1139
01:18:49,996 --> 01:18:52,498
[ Frank ] Double Jack Daniels on the rocks.

1140
01:18:52,582 --> 01:18:56,878
And bring my young friend here a Shirley Temple.

1141
01:18:56,920 --> 01:18:58,963
Hold on. Do you have beer ?

1142
01:18:59,047 --> 01:19:01,591
Certainly. May I see some I.D. ?

1143
01:19:01,674 --> 01:19:04,886
Are you interested in walkin' the rest of your life, chappy ?

1144
01:19:04,928 --> 01:19:06,220
Sir, but --

1145
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:09,807
I'm a regular here. My boy's going on 23.

1146
01:19:09,891 --> 01:19:12,685
Why don't you call up front, the office ?

1147
01:19:12,727 --> 01:19:16,189
Mr. Gilbert, he's a friend of mine.

1148
01:19:16,272 --> 01:19:19,400
Any particular beer ?

1149
01:19:19,484 --> 01:19:22,779
Schlitz. No Schlitz ?

1150
01:19:22,862 --> 01:19:25,281
Blatz. No Blatz ?

1151
01:19:25,365 --> 01:19:27,742
Improvise.

1152
01:19:27,784 --> 01:19:31,037
- I'll do my best, sir. - [ Frank ] Thank you, sir.

1153
01:19:32,747 --> 01:19:36,542
You're human, Charlie. Beer ?

1154
01:19:38,962 --> 01:19:41,130
Who are we drinking with ?

1155
01:19:41,214 --> 01:19:45,718
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water feeling from down there.

1156
01:19:52,392 --> 01:19:56,062
- Ah... female. - Female ?

1157
01:19:56,145 --> 01:20:00,567
You're callin' her female, must mean you like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1158
01:20:03,236 --> 01:20:06,864
- Is she alone ? - Yeah, she's alone.

1159
01:20:09,158 --> 01:20:12,412
Things are heatin' up. Chestnut hair ?

1160
01:20:12,495 --> 01:20:15,832
Brown... Light brown.

1161
01:20:15,915 --> 01:20:19,127
Twenty-two ?

1162
01:20:21,170 --> 01:20:23,506
Wh-- What am l, a guy at a carnival ?

1163
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:27,552
The day we stop lookin', Charlie, is the day we die.

1164
01:20:27,635 --> 01:20:29,887
Move.

1165
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:32,181
- Where ? - You know where, son.

1166
01:20:32,265 --> 01:20:34,559
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1167
01:20:35,852 --> 01:20:38,771
This woman is made for you. I can feel it.

1168
01:20:38,855 --> 01:20:41,107
Goddamn beautiful, isn't she ?

1169
01:20:41,190 --> 01:20:45,820
- She's not bad. - Whoo-bingo ! The boy's alive.

1170
01:20:45,904 --> 01:20:49,532
Come on, son, perambulate.

1171
01:20:49,616 --> 01:20:53,286
Perambulate.

1172
01:21:00,793 --> 01:21:04,714
Excuse me, senorita, do you mind if we join you ?

1173
01:21:06,090 --> 01:21:08,176
I'm feelin' you're being neglected.

1174
01:21:08,259 --> 01:21:11,846
Well, I'm expecting somebody.

1175
01:21:11,888 --> 01:21:15,141
Instantly ?

1176
01:21:15,225 --> 01:21:19,437
- No, but any minute now. - Any minute ?

1177
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:22,190
Some people live a lifetime in a minute.

1178
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:28,363
- What are you doin' right now ? - I'm waiting for him.

1179
01:21:28,446 --> 01:21:31,532
Would you mind if we waited with you,

1180
01:21:31,574 --> 01:21:35,745
you know, just to keep the womanizers from bothering you ?

1181
01:21:38,831 --> 01:21:40,792
No, I don't mind.

1182
01:21:40,875 --> 01:21:43,544
Thank you.

1183
01:21:45,880 --> 01:21:47,840
Charlie.

1184
01:21:51,135 --> 01:21:54,514
You know, I detect... a fragrance in the air.

1185
01:21:54,597 --> 01:21:56,975
Don't tell me what it is.

1186
01:21:57,058 --> 01:21:59,269
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1187
01:21:59,352 --> 01:22:02,564
Ah, that's amazing.

1188
01:22:02,647 --> 01:22:04,899
I'm in the amazing business !

1189
01:22:04,941 --> 01:22:06,943
It is Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1190
01:22:07,026 --> 01:22:10,321
My grandmother gave me three bars for Christmas.

1191
01:22:10,405 --> 01:22:12,615
I'm crazy about your grandmother.

1192
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:15,493
I think she'd have liked Charlie too.

1193
01:22:15,577 --> 01:22:17,870
- Don't pay any attention to him. - What's your name ?

1194
01:22:17,954 --> 01:22:19,455
Donna.

1195
01:22:19,539 --> 01:22:24,252
- Donna ? I'm Frank. This here is -- - This is Charlie.

1196
01:22:24,335 --> 01:22:26,462
Yes. She likes you.

1197
01:22:26,546 --> 01:22:29,757
Charlie's having a difficult weekend. He's going through a crisis.

1198
01:22:29,841 --> 01:22:32,594
How does he look like he's holding up ?

1199
01:22:32,677 --> 01:22:35,638
He looks fine to me.

1200
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:38,141
Oh ! She does like you, Charlie.

1201
01:22:42,812 --> 01:22:45,064
So, Donna,

1202
01:22:45,148 --> 01:22:46,858
ah...

1203
01:22:46,941 --> 01:22:48,943
do you tango ?

1204
01:22:49,027 --> 01:22:52,614
No. I wanted to learn once, but --

1205
01:22:52,697 --> 01:22:55,074
But ?

1206
01:22:55,158 --> 01:22:57,744
But Michael didn't want to.

1207
01:22:57,827 --> 01:23:01,205
Michael, the one you're waiting for.

1208
01:23:01,289 --> 01:23:05,001
Michael thinks the tango's hysterical.

1209
01:23:05,084 --> 01:23:08,338
Well, I think Michael's hysterical.

1210
01:23:08,421 --> 01:23:11,633
Don't pay any attention to him. Did I already say that ?

1211
01:23:13,551 --> 01:23:16,054
What a beautiful laugh.

1212
01:23:17,555 --> 01:23:19,557
Thank you, Frank.

1213
01:23:24,312 --> 01:23:27,440
Would you like to learn to tango, Donna ?

1214
01:23:30,526 --> 01:23:32,528
Right now ?

1215
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:37,242
I'm offering you my services... free of charge.

1216
01:23:37,325 --> 01:23:39,285
What do you say ?

1217
01:23:39,369 --> 01:23:41,162
Ah...

1218
01:23:41,246 --> 01:23:44,374
I think I'd be a little afraid.

1219
01:23:44,457 --> 01:23:46,626
Of what ?

1220
01:23:46,709 --> 01:23:50,964
Afraid of making a mistake.

1221
01:23:51,047 --> 01:23:55,343
No mistakes in the tango, not like life.

1222
01:23:55,426 --> 01:23:58,012
It's simple. That's what makes the tango so great.

1223
01:23:58,096 --> 01:24:02,934
If you make a mistake, get all tangled up, just tango on.

1224
01:24:03,017 --> 01:24:06,521
[ Frank ] Why don't you try ?

1225
01:24:10,316 --> 01:24:12,944
Will you try it ?

1226
01:24:13,027 --> 01:24:16,531
All right. I'll give it a try.

1227
01:24:16,614 --> 01:24:19,284
Hold me down, son.

1228
01:24:26,332 --> 01:24:28,793
Your arm.

1229
01:24:30,587 --> 01:24:33,214
Charlie,

1230
01:24:33,298 --> 01:24:35,842
I'm gonna need some coordinates here, son.

1231
01:24:35,925 --> 01:24:38,886
The floor's about 20 by 30,

1232
01:24:38,970 --> 01:24:41,931
And you're at the long end.

1233
01:24:42,015 --> 01:24:46,019
There's tables on the outside. The band's on the right.

1234
01:27:24,844 --> 01:27:29,515
Oh, Frank, you are one incredible dancer.

1235
01:27:32,060 --> 01:27:35,730
Wait'll you see Charlie dance.

1236
01:27:35,813 --> 01:27:38,942
- He's a liar. I don't dance. - Isn't he a charmer, though ?

1237
01:27:39,025 --> 01:27:43,196
Truth is, not only can he dance, but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1238
01:27:43,279 --> 01:27:45,949
He can do bird calls and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1239
01:27:46,032 --> 01:27:48,076
- Hi, honey. - Hey.

1240
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:51,788
Michael, this is Frank and this is Charlie.

1241
01:27:51,871 --> 01:27:55,500
-Hi, Frank, Charlie. I'm sorry I'm late. -Oh, that's okay.

1242
01:27:55,583 --> 01:27:58,294
These two gentlemen entertained me,

1243
01:27:58,336 --> 01:28:00,964
and time flew.

1244
01:28:01,047 --> 01:28:04,842
Your girl is... a hell of a tango dancer.

1245
01:28:04,926 --> 01:28:07,553
You found someone to tango with. That's terrific !

1246
01:28:07,637 --> 01:28:09,639
Let me shake your hand.

1247
01:28:09,722 --> 01:28:12,976
- No, it was Frank. - Hell, I'll shake both your hands !

1248
01:28:14,477 --> 01:28:17,272
Honey, this looks like the place, but we gotta go.

1249
01:28:17,355 --> 01:28:20,441
We got a date with Darryl and Carol in the village.

1250
01:28:20,525 --> 01:28:22,443
Do you have a check ?

1251
01:28:22,527 --> 01:28:27,198
- Michael, please. My pleasure. - No, no. I got this.

1252
01:28:27,282 --> 01:28:30,118
Michael, get your hand outta your pocket. I'll take it. Really.

1253
01:28:30,201 --> 01:28:33,705
Allow me.

1254
01:28:33,788 --> 01:28:36,332
Why, thank you.

1255
01:28:36,374 --> 01:28:38,376
Bye, guys.

1256
01:28:38,418 --> 01:28:40,587
Bye.

1257
01:28:47,760 --> 01:28:51,598
Darryl and Carol. Yeah.

1258
01:28:59,564 --> 01:29:02,859
[ Manny ] It's Apartment 17 E, Colonel. She's expecting you.

1259
01:29:02,942 --> 01:29:06,863
You don't have to worry about a thing. She's the creme de la creme.

1260
01:29:06,905 --> 01:29:09,407
My buddy took the Vice Chancellor of Germany to her.

1261
01:29:09,490 --> 01:29:11,910
Now he wants to immigrate to this country.

1262
01:29:11,993 --> 01:29:14,037
[ Frank ] You did good, hombre.

1263
01:29:16,414 --> 01:29:19,250
My hair, how is it ?

1264
01:29:19,292 --> 01:29:21,252
It's perfect.

1265
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:28,301

- My father's a major fund-raiser, you know. - No, I didn't.

His, ah --

he's gonna talk to the headmaster.

What kind of ride ?

Yeah, this is a valid Oregon driver's license,

and we let appropriate customers test-drive the Testarossa.

Uh, that's first bell.

1738
02:09:22,928 --> 02:09:25,973
Just got time to get cleaned up.

1739
02:09:27,224 --> 02:09:29,769
Oh. I almost forgot.

1740
02:09:34,982 --> 02:09:37,485
I owe you some money.

1741
02:09:39,111 --> 02:09:43,157
Three hundred dollars, hmm ? Job well done.

1742
02:09:45,951 --> 02:09:48,037
You ever need any references, Charlie,

1743
02:09:48,120 --> 02:09:52,833
- I'm your man. - Thanks, Colonel.

1744
02:09:59,924 --> 02:10:03,636
- Uh, it's 16 Water Street. Just over the bridge. - We'll find it.

1745
02:10:04,971 --> 02:10:07,014
Good-bye, Charlie.

1746
02:10:08,641 --> 02:10:10,559
Good-bye, Colonel.

1747
02:10:14,063 --> 02:10:15,982
Come here, son.

1748
02:10:31,747 --> 02:10:33,958
Okay, Manny.

1749
02:11:47,990 --> 02:11:50,076
George. George !

1750
02:12:28,823 --> 02:12:31,867
I called an open meeting of this institution this morning...

1751
02:12:31,951 --> 02:12:35,413
because the incident that occurred this Tuesday last...

1752
02:12:35,454 --> 02:12:39,542
describes an issue that concerns all of us.

1753
02:12:40,885 --> 02:12:44,180
Not an isolated case of vandalism, what happened...

1754
02:12:44,222 --> 02:12:48,768
is a symptom of the sickness of a society,

1755
02:12:48,851 --> 02:12:52,772
a sickness which runs counter to the principles...

1756
02:12:52,855 --> 02:12:54,774
this school was founded on,

1757
02:12:56,734 --> 02:13:01,948
a school, among whose graduates two have sat behind the desk in the Oval Office,

1758
02:13:02,031 --> 02:13:04,909
in the White House.

1759
02:13:04,951 --> 02:13:08,079
Baird men have run state departments and investment houses,

1760
02:13:08,162 --> 02:13:12,291
founded department stores and coached football teams.

1761
02:13:12,375 --> 02:13:16,087
Our alumni receive their bulletins in ashrams in India...

1762
02:13:16,170 --> 02:13:18,089
and in palaces in Jordan.

1763
02:13:18,172 --> 02:13:20,383
We are, in fact, known around the world...

1764
02:13:20,425 --> 02:13:23,219
as the cradle of this country's leadership.

1765
02:13:23,261 --> 02:13:25,847
- A beacon in the nation's -- - What are you doing here ?

1766
02:13:25,930 --> 02:13:28,891
- Got room for me up there, Charlie ? - But today,

1767
02:13:28,975 --> 02:13:31,936
- We are bleeding from disrespect, - Yeah, I guess so.

1768
02:13:31,978 --> 02:13:36,065
- Give us a hand. - disrespect for our values...

1769
02:13:36,149 --> 02:13:39,902
and a disrespect for our standards,

1770
02:13:39,986 --> 02:13:43,448
a disrespect for the Baird tradition.

1771
02:13:43,531 --> 02:13:47,034
And, as the custodians of that tradition,

1772
02:13:47,118 --> 02:13:52,039
we are here today to protect each other...

1773
02:13:52,123 --> 02:13:55,751
from those who threaten it.

1774
02:13:55,835 --> 02:13:58,463
Who is this, Mr. Simms ?

1775
02:13:58,546 --> 02:14:02,550
- Uh -- - This is Mr. Frank Slade,

1776
02:14:02,633 --> 02:14:06,095
Lieutenant Colonel, United States Army, retired.

1777
02:14:07,305 --> 02:14:09,599
I'm here in place of Charlie's parents.

1778
02:14:09,682 --> 02:14:13,478
- Excuse me ? - In loco parentis.

1779
02:14:15,396 --> 02:14:18,316
They could not make the trip from Oregon today.

1780
02:14:18,357 --> 02:14:20,860
And what is your relationship to Mr. Simms ?

1781
02:14:20,943 --> 02:14:24,238
Is this a courtroom ?

1782
02:14:24,322 --> 02:14:27,617
- Closest thing we could manage to it. - Then if we're taking oaths,

1783
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:30,203
there's a few people I'd like to swear in.

1784
02:14:32,497 --> 02:14:37,210
There are no oaths at Baird. We are all on our honor.

1785
02:14:39,670 --> 02:14:42,381
Larry and Franny Simms...

1786
02:14:42,465 --> 02:14:45,384
are very dear, close friends of mine.

1787
02:14:45,468 --> 02:14:49,472
They've asked me to appear here on Charlie's behalf.

1788
02:14:49,555 --> 02:14:52,141
Okay ?

1789
02:14:53,392 --> 02:14:55,853
Happy to have you with us, Colonel.

1790
02:15:00,066 --> 02:15:02,026
Mr. Willis.

1791
02:15:03,861 --> 02:15:07,198
- Which Mr. Willis ? - George, Junior, sir.

1792
02:15:11,828 --> 02:15:15,164
You were in a position last Tuesday night...

1793
02:15:15,206 --> 02:15:19,252
to see who committed this act of vandalism. Who was it ?

1794
02:15:21,629 --> 02:15:24,882
Well, uh, I have an idea who it was.

1795
02:15:24,966 --> 02:15:28,386
No, no, not an idea, Mr. Willis. Did you see or did you not see ?

1796
02:15:31,556 --> 02:15:33,474
Well...

1797
02:15:34,559 --> 02:15:37,353
I-l didn't have my contacts in.

1798
02:15:40,857 --> 02:15:43,025
Come on.

1799
02:15:46,070 --> 02:15:49,031
I was in the library. I'd taken my glasses off,

1800
02:15:49,115 --> 02:15:52,326
and I was gonna put my contacts back in.

1801
02:15:52,410 --> 02:15:54,495
Um,

1802
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:56,789
I --

1803
02:15:56,873 --> 02:15:58,791
Then I helped Simms close up,

1804
02:15:58,875 --> 02:16:02,378
and the next thing I know, we're outside,

1805
02:16:02,420 --> 02:16:06,257
and I hear this sound, and l, um,

1806
02:16:06,340 --> 02:16:09,427
didn't have any time to put my contacts in.

1807
02:16:09,510 --> 02:16:12,388
Whom, with your limited vision, did you see ?

1808
02:16:16,851 --> 02:16:19,270
[ Whispering ]

1809
02:16:30,198 --> 02:16:32,617
Like I say, it was blurry.

1810
02:16:33,785 --> 02:16:35,912
Uh,

1811
02:16:38,039 --> 02:16:40,750
I can't see without my contacts.

1812
02:16:40,792 --> 02:16:43,169
What did you see, Mr. Willis ?

1813
02:16:43,252 --> 02:16:45,630
What ?

1814
02:16:45,713 --> 02:16:48,424
- What, you mean definitively ? - Stop fencing with me, Mr. Willis !

1815
02:16:48,508 --> 02:16:51,469
Tell me what you saw !

1816
02:16:55,515 --> 02:16:58,101
Now, don't hold me to this, but...

1817
02:16:58,184 --> 02:17:00,978
no contacts, it's dark...

1818
02:17:02,355 --> 02:17:04,315
and everything, I mean --

1819
02:17:04,357 --> 02:17:07,735
- Mr. Willis ! - [ Willis Sighing ]

1820
02:17:07,819 --> 02:17:12,281
Maybe...

1821
02:17:12,365 --> 02:17:14,951
Harry Havemeyer,

1822
02:17:14,992 --> 02:17:17,995
Trent Potter and Jimmy Jameson.

1823
02:17:22,291 --> 02:17:25,378
- Maybe ? - Ballpark, best guess.

1824
02:17:27,171 --> 02:17:31,384
[ Trask ] Could you provide us with some detail ?

1825
02:17:31,467 --> 02:17:33,803
I mean, why don't you ask Charlie ?

1826
02:17:33,845 --> 02:17:37,140
I really think he was closer.

1827
02:17:44,856 --> 02:17:46,816
Mr. Simms.

1828
02:17:46,858 --> 02:17:49,152
[ Clearing Throat ] Yes.

1829
02:17:49,193 --> 02:17:51,404
You don't wear contact lenses, do you ?

1830
02:17:51,487 --> 02:17:53,865
No, sir.

1831
02:17:55,283 --> 02:17:59,495
With your untrammeled sight, whom did you see ?

1832
02:18:03,791 --> 02:18:05,960
Well, I saw -- I saw something,

1833
02:18:07,420 --> 02:18:10,423
but l-l-l I couldn't say who.

1834
02:18:10,506 --> 02:18:13,426
[ Trask ] All right. What was the something you saw ?

1835
02:18:17,722 --> 02:18:20,516
- I-l couldn't say. - You couldn't say or you wouldn't say ?

1836
02:18:23,227 --> 02:18:25,188
Well, I just -- I --

1837
02:18:28,900 --> 02:18:31,402
- I just couldn't say. I'm -- - Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

1838
02:18:31,444 --> 02:18:33,404
You're exhausting my patience...

1839
02:18:33,446 --> 02:18:35,656
and making a mockery of these proceedings.

1840
02:18:35,740 --> 02:18:36,866
I will give you one last chance.

1841
02:18:36,908 --> 02:18:39,494
The consequences of your response will be dire.

1842
02:18:39,577 --> 02:18:44,916
By dire I mean your future will be jeopardized permanently.

1843
02:18:44,999 --> 02:18:47,251
Now for the last time,

1844
02:18:47,335 --> 02:18:49,921
what did you see last Tuesday night...

1845
02:18:50,004 --> 02:18:51,923
outside my office ?

1846
02:18:55,134 --> 02:18:57,095
I saw somebody.

1847
02:18:57,136 --> 02:18:59,847
"l saw somebody." Good.

1848
02:19:00,932 --> 02:19:02,934
Did you see their size and shape ?

1849
02:19:03,017 --> 02:19:05,812
Yeah.

1850
02:19:05,895 --> 02:19:09,357
And they were the size and shape of whom ?

1851
02:19:14,987 --> 02:19:18,825
They were the size and shape --

1852
02:19:32,463 --> 02:19:35,258
of most any Baird student, sir.

1853
02:19:49,188 --> 02:19:51,816
I am left with no real witness.

1854
02:19:53,401 --> 02:19:57,280
Mr. Willis's testimony is not only vague, it is unsubstantiated.

1855
02:19:57,321 --> 02:20:00,283
The substance I was looking for, Mr. Simms,

1856
02:20:00,324 --> 02:20:02,827
was to come from you.

1857
02:20:05,788 --> 02:20:07,748
I'm sorry.

1858
02:20:08,875 --> 02:20:11,627
I'm sorry too, Mr. Simms,

1859
02:20:11,669 --> 02:20:14,130
because you know what I'm going to do,

1860
02:20:14,172 --> 02:20:16,507
inasmuch as I can't punish Mr. Havemeyer,

1861
02:20:16,591 --> 02:20:18,676
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson ?

1862
02:20:18,760 --> 02:20:20,887
And I won't punish Mr. Willis.

1863
02:20:20,970 --> 02:20:23,389
He's the only party to this incident...

1864
02:20:23,473 --> 02:20:26,434
who is still worthy of calling himself a Baird man.

1865
02:20:27,810 --> 02:20:30,980
I'm going to recommend to the Disciplinary Committee...

1866
02:20:32,064 --> 02:20:34,025
that you be expelled.

1867
02:20:34,066 --> 02:20:36,903
Mr. Simms, you are a cover-up artist...

1868
02:20:36,986 --> 02:20:38,905
and you are a liar.

1869
02:20:38,988 --> 02:20:41,073
But not a snitch !

1870
02:20:41,157 --> 02:20:43,659
Excuse me ?

1871
02:20:43,743 --> 02:20:45,495
No, I don't think I will.

1872
02:20:45,578 --> 02:20:50,166
- Mr. Slade. - This is such a crock of shit !

1873
02:20:50,208 --> 02:20:53,085
[ Trask ] Please watch your language, Mr. Slade.

1874
02:20:53,169 --> 02:20:56,088
You are in the Baird school, not a barracks.

1875
02:20:56,172 --> 02:20:59,342
Mr. Simms, I will give you one final opportunity to speak up.

1876
02:20:59,383 --> 02:21:01,928
Mr. Simms doesn't want it.

1877
02:21:02,011 --> 02:21:03,930
He doesn't need to be labeled...

1878
02:21:04,013 --> 02:21:06,682
"still worthy of being a Baird man."

1879
02:21:06,724 --> 02:21:08,684
What the hell is that ?

1880
02:21:08,726 --> 02:21:10,686
What is your motto here ?

1881
02:21:10,728 --> 02:21:14,982
"Boys, inform on your classmates, save your hide;

1882
02:21:15,066 --> 02:21:17,944
anything short of that, we're gonna burn you at the stake" ?

1883
02:21:18,027 --> 02:21:20,780
Well, gentlemen,

1884
02:21:20,863 --> 02:21:24,033
when the shit hits the fan, some guys run...

1885
02:21:24,117 --> 02:21:26,077
and some guys stay.

1886
02:21:26,119 --> 02:21:29,580
Here's Charlie facin' the fire, and there's George...

1887
02:21:29,664 --> 02:21:31,958
hidin' in big daddy's pocket.

1888
02:21:32,041 --> 02:21:33,960
And what are you doin' ?

1889
02:21:34,043 --> 02:21:35,920
You're gonna reward George...

1890
02:21:36,003 --> 02:21:39,382
and destroy Charlie.

1891
02:21:39,423 --> 02:21:43,803
-Are you finished, Mr. Slade ? -No, I'm just gettin' warmed up.

1892
02:21:43,886 --> 02:21:46,431
[ Slade ] I don't know who went to this place.

1893
02:21:46,514 --> 02:21:49,225
William Howard Taft, William Jennings Bryant,

1894
02:21:49,267 --> 02:21:51,227
William Tell, whoever.

1895

There is no prosthetic for that.

Because he's not a Baird man.

02:24:06,195 --> 02:24:08,239
"cradle of leadership."

1940

Well, when the bough breaks,

the cradle will fall, and it has fallen here.

Be careful what kind of leaders you're producin' here.

1945
02:24:23,129 --> 02:24:26,924
I don't know if Charlie's silence here today...

1946
02:24:27,008 --> 02:24:29,719
is right or wrong; I'm not a judge or jury.

1947

But I can tell you this:

And that, my friends, is called integrity.

1951
02:24:40,938 --> 02:24:42,899
That's called courage.

1952
02:24:42,940 --> 02:24:46,402
Now that's the stuff leaders should be made of.

1953

Now I have come to the crossroads in my life.

I always knew what the right path was.

You know why ?

1957

It was too damn hard.

Now here's Charlie. He's come to the crossroads.

He has chosen a path.

It's the right path.

1961
02:25:18,893 --> 02:25:21,354
It's a path made of principle...

02:32:26,988 --> 02:32:28,948
Is it a walrus ?

2056
02:32:29,031 --> 02:32:30,950
No, it's Willie.

2057
02:32:31,033 --> 02:32:33,786
Willie, why don't you help me with my bag ?

2058
02:32:33,870 --> 02:32:36,706
Come on, son. Help me with my bag.

2059
02:32:36,789 --> 02:32:39,041
Come on. Come on.

2060
02:32:39,125 --> 02:32:41,919
You got it. Hold onto it. You're strong.

2061
02:32:42,003 --> 02:32:44,172
Come on.

2062
02:32:45,381 --> 02:32:47,884
Here we are.

2063
02:32:47,967 --> 02:32:50,428
Francine, come on with me and Willie.

2064
02:32:50,511 --> 02:32:53,306
I'll let you make me some marshmallow chocolate.

2065
02:32:53,389 --> 02:32:56,142
