Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us ?

309
00:24:35,617 --> 00:24:37,577
Thank you.
You too, Mr. Willis.

I'm not quite through
with you yet.

314
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:04,979
One of the few perks
of this office is that...

315
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:10,401
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on my own as I see fit.

- Yes, sir.
- Good.

the board and tuition in Cambridge.

Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year ?

326
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:51,943
- No, sir.
- You. You, Mr. Simms.

327

Now can you tell me
who did it ?

No, sir, I can't.

You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothing ?

He said the same thing.
He just said it over.

Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse
from you. Are you panicking ?

- Yeah, a little.
- Come on.

- You're on scholarship, right ?
- Yeah.

You're on scholarship
from Oregon... at Baird.

You're a long way from home, Chas.

What's that got to do
with anything ?

I don't know how
it works out there.

But how it works here ?
We stick together.

348

It's us against them,
no matter what.

We don't cover our ass.
We don't tell our parents.

00:33:54,484 --> 00:33:57,945
- [ Meowing ]
- [ Frank ] Tomster, come here, boy.

461
00:33:57,987 --> 00:34:00,573
Psst, psst.
Come on.

462
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:04,661
Here, tomster, come on.
Tomster, tomster. Yeah.

463
00:34:05,995 --> 00:34:10,958
Remember, when in doubt... fuck.

464
00:34:14,045 --> 00:34:16,631
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination ?

465
00:34:16,714 --> 00:34:19,634
Our destination... New York City,
home of the brave !

466
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:22,804
- Two for the shuttle to New York.
- I'm not shuttling anywhere.

467
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:26,683
- Look at those tickets. "First class."
- Yes, sir, first class.

468
00:34:26,766 --> 00:34:30,561
You bought me a ticket ?
I never said I'd go to New York.

469
00:34:30,645 --> 00:34:34,816
What are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only ?

470
00:34:34,857 --> 00:34:36,818
Gate 46, sir.

471
00:34:36,859 --> 00:34:39,696
- As you were, son.
- Thank you, sir.

472
00:34:39,779 --> 00:34:42,323
Which way's the door ?

473
00:34:42,365 --> 00:34:46,452
- Are you blind ? Are you blind ?
- Of course not.

474
00:34:46,536 --> 00:34:49,789
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm ?

475
00:34:49,872 --> 00:34:53,251
I take your arm.

476
00:34:56,546 --> 00:34:58,589
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

477
00:34:58,673 --> 00:35:01,342
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life ?

478
00:35:01,551 --> 00:35:03,886
Yes !

479
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:08,016
- Jack Daniels...
- You bet.

480
00:35:10,059 --> 00:35:13,312
- And Diet Slice.
- The old Diet Slice.

481
00:35:13,396 --> 00:35:15,690
- And a water.
- Thank you, Daphne.

482
00:35:15,732 --> 00:35:17,650
Certainly, sir.

483
00:35:22,655 --> 00:35:24,699
Ahh ! Mmm !

484
00:35:24,782 --> 00:35:28,619
How did you know her name ?

485
00:35:28,703 --> 00:35:32,081
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

486
00:35:32,123 --> 00:35:35,335
That's an
English cologne.

487
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:39,464
But her voice is
California chickie.

488
00:35:39,547 --> 00:35:43,426
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady --

489
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:47,138
I call her Daphne.

490
00:35:47,221 --> 00:35:51,726
Oh, big things may happen to
that little thing of yours.

491
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:56,064
Look, Colonel,

492
00:35:56,105 --> 00:35:58,358
- I'll get you to New York, all right ?
- Uh-huh.

493
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:01,778
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

494
00:36:01,861 --> 00:36:04,989
Well, Chuck, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

495
00:36:05,073 --> 00:36:08,242
Charlie, all right ?
Or Charles.

496
00:36:08,284 --> 00:36:10,578
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

497
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,664
Chuck is a --

498
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:18,378
So, why are we
going to New York ?

499
00:36:18,461 --> 00:36:22,006
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

500
00:36:23,841 --> 00:36:25,802
Whoo-ah !

501
00:36:25,843 --> 00:36:28,054
Where's Daphne ?
Let's get her down here.

502
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:32,266
She's in the back.

503
00:36:32,308 --> 00:36:35,895
A tail's in the tail.

504
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:37,939
Hah !

505
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:41,150
Oh, but I still smell her.
[ Sniffing ]

506
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:45,988
Women !

507
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:49,158
What can you say ?

508
00:36:49,242 --> 00:36:51,828
Who made 'em ?

509
00:36:51,911 --> 00:36:54,038
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

510
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:01,462
The hair --

511
00:37:01,504 --> 00:37:05,633
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

512
00:37:05,717 --> 00:37:09,804
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls...

513
00:37:09,887 --> 00:37:14,726
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever ?

514
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:18,521
Or lips --

515
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:20,648
and when they touched,
yours were like...

516
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:24,485
that first swallow
of wine...

517
00:37:24,527 --> 00:37:26,863
after you just crossed
the desert.

518
00:37:30,491 --> 00:37:34,037
Tits ! Whoo-ah !

519
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:37,498
Big ones, little ones,

520
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,959
nipples staring
right out at ya...

521
00:37:40,043 --> 00:37:43,004
Like secret searchlights.

522
00:37:43,046 --> 00:37:45,965
Mmm.

523
00:37:46,883 --> 00:37:49,677
And legs --

524
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:53,014
I don't care if
they're Greek columns...

525
00:37:53,056 --> 00:37:56,517
or secondhand Steinways.

526
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:59,937
What's between 'em,

527
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:02,523
passport to heaven.

528
00:38:03,316 --> 00:38:05,360
I need a drink.

529
00:38:09,072 --> 00:38:12,367
Yes, Mr. Simms,

530
00:38:12,408 --> 00:38:17,372
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing:

531
00:38:21,292 --> 00:38:23,252
pussy.

532
00:38:24,087 --> 00:38:26,005
Hah !

533
00:38:26,089 --> 00:38:29,217
Are you listening to me, son ?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

534
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,096
I guess you
really like women.

535
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:36,766
Oh, above all things !

536
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:45,274
A very, very
distant second...

537
00:38:47,068 --> 00:38:49,862
is a Ferrari.

538
00:38:56,077 --> 00:38:59,080
Charlie ?

539
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:01,332
Give me your hand.

540
00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:06,671
This is just the start
of your education, son.

541
00:39:22,437 --> 00:39:24,397
Whoo-ah !

542
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,483
- Where are we ?
- Where are we, eh ?

543
00:39:27,567 --> 00:39:30,903
The cynosure of
all things civilized:

544
00:39:30,987 --> 00:39:33,031
the Waldorf-Astoria.

545
00:39:33,114 --> 00:39:37,493
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

546
00:39:37,577 --> 00:39:39,495
Had a Ferrari.

547
00:39:39,579 --> 00:39:42,707
Every day I held the door
open for the fucker.

548
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,792
Never even offered me
a ride.

549
00:39:44,876 --> 00:39:46,836
Well, fuck him.

550
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:49,297
He's dead and I'm blind.

551
00:39:53,051 --> 00:39:55,345
- Spread the word.
- Thank you, sir.

552
00:39:55,386 --> 00:39:58,973
- The intelligence will be forthcoming ?
- Sir ?

553
00:39:59,015 --> 00:40:01,017
On the escort scene.

554
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,603
Um, yes, sir.

555
00:40:03,686 --> 00:40:07,190
- And welcome to the Waldorf.
- Gracias, amigo.

556
00:40:08,691 --> 00:40:12,153
Puerto Ricans...
always made the best infantrymen.

557
00:40:17,909 --> 00:40:21,704
- [ Clanking ]
- Oh !

558
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:30,046
I'm home again.

559
00:40:30,129 --> 00:40:33,257
Give me an inventory
on this, will you ?

560
00:40:38,471 --> 00:40:40,640
All right,
where am l, in Asia ?

561
00:40:40,723 --> 00:40:43,601
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he ?

562
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:46,396
By the windows ?

563
00:40:46,437 --> 00:40:49,440
It's right here.

564
00:40:49,524 --> 00:40:51,567
Okay.

565
00:40:51,651 --> 00:40:53,986
We're in business.

566
00:40:57,907 --> 00:41:00,076
Get me the Oak Room.

567
00:41:00,118 --> 00:41:02,286
How's that inventory
comin' ?

568
00:41:04,247 --> 00:41:09,252
Uh, there's Jim Beam
and Early Times.

569
00:41:09,335 --> 00:41:12,255
Quartermaster's on the take again.
Hello.

570
00:41:12,296 --> 00:41:16,259
Is Sheldon or Mack there ?

571
00:41:16,342 --> 00:41:18,761
This is
Lt. Col. Frank Slade.

572
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:24,600
I used to be a regular. I used
to come in with a General Garbisch.

573
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:28,104
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington six feet under.

574
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:32,483
Listen up. I want a table for two, and
I don't mean Siberia, 8:15.

575
00:41:33,943 --> 00:41:36,487
Clear them little
bottles off.

576
00:41:36,571 --> 00:41:39,657
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

577
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:42,660
Tell him I want it
wall to wall with John Daniels.

578
00:41:42,744 --> 00:41:45,913
Uh, don't you mean,
uh, Jack Daniels ?

579
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:49,709
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have --

580
00:41:49,792 --> 00:41:51,294
That's a joke.
Hello !

581
00:41:51,377 --> 00:41:55,757
This is Lt. Col. Frank Slade.
I would like a limo, 8:00.

582
00:42:01,804 --> 00:42:03,931
What are you drinkin' ?

583
00:42:03,973 --> 00:42:07,685
Uh, nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

584
00:42:07,769 --> 00:42:10,772
What's useful about it ?

585
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:14,650
I don't know. Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

586
00:42:14,692 --> 00:42:16,778
Where you goin' ?

587
00:42:16,861 --> 00:42:20,615
Back to school. I've got some real
important stuff I have to take care of.

588
00:42:22,325 --> 00:42:24,786
Very well.

589
00:42:24,827 --> 00:42:27,997
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

590
00:42:28,081 --> 00:42:31,167
You'll dine with me and then my driver
will transport you...

591
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:34,796
to the airport for the Boston Shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

592
00:42:36,297 --> 00:42:39,676
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

593
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:41,844
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

594
00:42:43,346 --> 00:42:45,515
[ Frank ] What's your name,
driver ?

595
00:42:45,598 --> 00:42:48,267
- Manny, sir.
- Manny.

596
00:42:48,351 --> 00:42:51,979
The bellhops at the Waldorf, are they
any good at getting escorts ?

597
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:55,650
- I wouldn't know, sir.
- What would you know ?

598
00:42:55,692 --> 00:42:59,195
- About what ?
- About you-know-what ?

599
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,199
Maybe I could
manage something.

600
00:43:03,282 --> 00:43:06,411
[ Frank ] I'm talkin'
top of the line, now.

601
00:43:06,494 --> 00:43:08,746
Let me think
about this, sir.

602
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:18,423
What's the matter
with you ?

603
00:43:18,506 --> 00:43:23,302
- With me ?
- Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why ?

604
00:43:23,386 --> 00:43:26,889
You got the fuckin' weight of the world
on your shoulders.

605
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,601
[ Sigh ]

606
00:43:30,685 --> 00:43:33,104
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

607
00:43:33,187 --> 00:43:36,107
- Spit it out !
- It's not a big deal, all right ?

608
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:38,109
Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin' ?

609
00:43:38,192 --> 00:43:40,862
If it's not a big deal, why did you say
"real important stuff" ?

610
00:43:40,903 --> 00:43:45,116
What are you doin', banging
the dean's daughter ? Hah !

611
00:43:46,659 --> 00:43:50,413
- I'm just in a little trouble.
- What kind of trouble ?

612
00:43:50,496 --> 00:43:53,708
I saw some guys
doing something.

613
00:43:55,043 --> 00:43:58,421
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

614
00:43:58,504 --> 00:44:00,423

00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:41,504
what are the chances
of suitin' you up sometime ?

770
00:53:41,587 --> 00:53:44,549
- [ Operator ] Sugarbush Lodge.
- George Willis, please.

771
00:53:47,552 --> 00:53:50,972
- [ George ] Hello !
- George ! Hey, it's Charlie.

772
00:53:51,055 --> 00:53:54,183
Hey, Chas. Next year you gotta
come up with us.

773
00:53:54,267 --> 00:53:59,355
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

774
00:53:59,397 --> 00:54:02,066
Chas,
are you there ?

775
00:54:02,150 --> 00:54:04,360
Yeah, I'm here.
Um --

776
00:54:04,402 --> 00:54:07,530
- you told me to call you for the moves.
- All right.

777
00:54:07,613 --> 00:54:10,408
For now, the move's
no move: status quo.

778
00:54:10,491 --> 00:54:12,410
Everything's
the way we left it.

779
00:54:12,493 --> 00:54:15,079
How did we leave it ?

780
00:54:15,163 --> 00:54:18,833
See no evil,
hear no evil.

781
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:22,462
You know
what I mean, Chas ?

782
00:54:22,545 --> 00:54:25,423
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

783
00:54:27,675 --> 00:54:32,889
- Okay, then, walk like you talk !
- All right, good-bye.

784
00:54:32,972 --> 00:54:38,019
- George Willis, huh ?
- Yeah.

785
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:40,021
George Willis.

786
00:54:40,104 --> 00:54:44,025
That makes his father probably
George Willis, Senior.

787
00:54:44,108 --> 00:54:46,027
Charlie, I ask ya,

788
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:49,989
what do you think Big George
is gonna feel about Little George...

789
00:54:50,073 --> 00:54:53,117
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil ?

790
00:54:55,703 --> 00:54:57,830
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.

791
00:54:57,914 --> 00:55:00,792
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

792
00:55:00,875 --> 00:55:05,046
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing !

793
00:55:05,129 --> 00:55:07,965
Damn decent of him.
Ooh ! Aw ! Hah !

794
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,343
- Scusi.
- Prego.

795
00:55:10,426 --> 00:55:12,804
I love it
when you hurt me.

796
00:55:12,887 --> 00:55:15,348
Uh, tell me now,
Charlie.

797
00:55:15,431 --> 00:55:19,394
This, uh, George Willis, Junior,
what's his father do ?

798
00:55:19,477 --> 00:55:21,521
I don't really know.

799
00:55:21,604 --> 00:55:24,148
Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

800
00:55:24,232 --> 00:55:28,986
When George Willis, Sr., isn't busy as a
million-dollar man for Aetna Casualty --

801
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:32,490
or is it New England Distributor
for the Chrysler Corporation ?

802
00:55:32,573 --> 00:55:36,577
He concerns himself with his young son,
George Willis, Junior.

803
00:55:36,661 --> 00:55:39,998
George isn't going
to say anything to his father.

804
00:55:40,039 --> 00:55:42,333
Oh, Charlie.

805
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:44,585
Big George is gonna
wind up Little George,

806
00:55:44,669 --> 00:55:47,797
and Little George is gonna sing
like a canary.

807
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:50,383
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

808
00:55:50,466 --> 00:55:52,552
You've got this
all figured out, don't you ?

809
00:55:52,635 --> 00:55:57,015
It don't take no Young America merit
scholarship to figure this one out.

810
00:55:57,098 --> 00:56:00,977
Charlie, you had a little life,
so you decided to go to Baird...

811
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:04,105
to put yourself in the market
for a big one.

812
00:56:04,188 --> 00:56:06,149
Now, in order to stay
in the running,

813
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:09,068
you're gonna have to tell these people
what they want to know.

814
00:56:09,152 --> 00:56:11,320
You think so ?

815
00:56:11,404 --> 00:56:13,364
- Are we finished, Sofia ?
- Yes.

816
00:56:13,406 --> 00:56:16,284
Grazie. Grazie.

817
00:56:18,077 --> 00:56:20,663
Charlie,

818
00:56:20,705 --> 00:56:23,583
if you don't sing now,

819
00:56:23,666 --> 00:56:26,961
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits...

820
00:56:27,045 --> 00:56:30,006
in some convenience store
in the Oregon burbs,

821
00:56:30,089 --> 00:56:34,302
probably the last word you'll ever hear
yourself say just before you croak...

822
00:56:34,385 --> 00:56:38,348
gonna be, "Have a nice day
and come back soon."

823
00:56:38,431 --> 00:56:40,600
Sofia !

824
00:56:40,683 --> 00:56:44,645
Measure up Charlie, pronto.
We got a date for Thanksgiving.

825
00:56:44,729 --> 00:56:46,731
We got a date ?

826
00:56:46,814 --> 00:56:48,983
My brother's place.

827
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:51,819
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

828
00:56:51,903 --> 00:56:55,365
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

829
00:56:55,406 --> 00:56:58,201
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

830
00:57:00,578 --> 00:57:05,041
Uh, well you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

831
00:57:05,124 --> 00:57:08,920
I mean, eats and treats.
I could use the company.

832
00:57:12,548 --> 00:57:15,468
All right.
D-Does he know I'm comin' ?

833
00:57:15,551 --> 00:57:18,471
He doesn't know I'm comin'. But wait
till you see the look on his face...

834
00:57:18,554 --> 00:57:20,473
when I walk through
the door.

835
00:57:20,556 --> 00:57:23,226
Oh, he loves me !

836
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:28,439
Oh, uh, Charlie,
about your little problem,

837
00:57:28,523 --> 00:57:31,025
there are two kinds of people
in this world:

838
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:33,528
those who stand up
and face the music,

839
00:57:33,611 --> 00:57:35,530
and those who
run for cover.

840
00:57:35,613 --> 00:57:39,200
Cover's better.
Okay, Sofia, suit 'im up !

841
00:57:39,283 --> 00:57:42,912
Make him pretty !

842
00:57:57,260 --> 00:58:00,221
Careful.

843
00:58:00,263 --> 00:58:03,182
- Should I ring it ?
- Yeah.

844
00:58:09,731 --> 00:58:11,733
Yes ?

845
00:58:11,816 --> 00:58:14,277
Yes !
Who is this ?

846
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:18,740
- It's Randy.
- Randy ? You new ?

847
00:58:18,781 --> 00:58:20,950
I'm your nephew.

848
00:58:21,034 --> 00:58:23,703
Hah !
Here I am !

849
00:58:23,786 --> 00:58:26,956
Your sister's been
hoarding me long enough.

850
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,959
- Thought it's time to spread
the riches around.
- Uncle Frank !

851
00:58:30,043 --> 00:58:32,003
- Gloria !
- Gail.

852
00:58:32,086 --> 00:58:34,005
Of course.

853
00:58:34,088 --> 00:58:37,550
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

854
00:58:37,633 --> 00:58:40,678
Good old Uncle Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

855
00:58:40,762 --> 00:58:43,056
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

856
00:58:43,097 --> 00:58:47,352
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School too.

857
00:58:47,435 --> 00:58:49,937
Where's your
miserable father ?

858
00:58:50,021 --> 00:58:52,565
Wait ! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

859
00:58:52,607 --> 00:58:55,693
Give that fat heart
of his an attack. Willie !

860
00:58:57,987 --> 00:59:00,865
Oh, Willie !

861
00:59:11,209 --> 00:59:13,211
Hello, Frank.

862
00:59:13,294 --> 00:59:16,673
- How you doin' ?
- Okay.

863
00:59:16,756 --> 00:59:21,552
Here's my hand.
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

864
00:59:21,636 --> 00:59:23,680
Nice to meet you, sir.

865
00:59:23,763 --> 00:59:26,641
The original bulging
briefcase man.

866
00:59:26,724 --> 00:59:31,145
Gretchen, I smell those prunes !
We talkin' Turkey Marbella ?

867
00:59:31,187 --> 00:59:33,940
- Yes, we are.
- Whoo !

868
00:59:34,023 --> 00:59:36,693
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

869
00:59:36,776 --> 00:59:38,736
You know, I always had a sneaker
for you. Come here.

870
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,947
[ Sniffing ]
Mmm.

871
00:59:41,030 --> 00:59:42,990
Hah !

872
00:59:43,032 --> 00:59:47,286
- Where are you, Garry ?
I heard you cough.
- Who are you again ?

873
00:59:47,328 --> 00:59:51,958
I'm just here at the Waldorf-Astoria
with -- Is it your brother ?

874
00:59:52,041 --> 00:59:54,502
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin' ?

875
00:59:54,544 --> 00:59:59,632
- Yes. Who the hell are you ?
- I'm kinda takin' care
of him for the weekend.

876
00:59:59,716 --> 01:00:00,842
Charlie !

877
01:00:00,925 --> 01:00:03,136
Jesus !

878
01:00:03,177 --> 01:00:07,724
Sorry. Where's the booze ?
Flowin' like mud here.

879
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:12,061
To tell the truth, the colonel's
not well, I don't think.

880
01:00:12,145 --> 01:00:15,231
- Not well ?
- I think he's a little lonely.

881
01:00:15,314 --> 01:00:18,192
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner ?

882
01:00:18,276 --> 01:00:20,903
I heard that !

883
01:00:20,987 --> 01:00:23,364
I heard that.

884
01:00:23,448 --> 01:00:26,075
Pay no attention to him.
That's his big-brother talk.

885
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,828
He's been watching out for me
since day one.

886
01:00:28,870 --> 01:00:33,416
Bailed me out of more trouble...
than he'd like to remember.

887
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:36,002
- Hmm ?
- [ Gretchen ] Let me take your coat.

888
01:00:36,085 --> 01:00:40,548
I meant to pick up some vino
on my way, but I blew it.

889
01:00:40,631 --> 01:00:43,092
I'll send you the Rothschild
again for Christmas,

890
01:00:43,176 --> 01:00:47,096
- only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.
- I'll set two more places.

891
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:50,516
- Here's your drink, Frank.
- Thank you, Randy.

892
01:00:50,558 --> 01:00:53,186
Still with
Snow Queen sugar ?

893
01:00:53,227 --> 01:00:57,065
Snow Flake. Why do you
always get that wrong ?

894
01:00:57,148 --> 01:01:00,443
Because it's not important for me to
get it right. What are you doing there ?

895
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:03,780
I'm Vice President
for Marketing.

896
01:01:03,863 --> 01:01:07,825
Whoo-ah ! Congratulations !
Sugar is shit, though.

897
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:11,329
I told General Abrams to install
honey in the commissaries.

898
01:01:11,412 --> 01:01:14,707
If the K-50s didn't blow your brains
out, sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

899
01:01:16,292 --> 01:01:18,628
- Why don't we all sit down ?
- Ooh !

900
01:01:18,711 --> 01:01:22,632
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie.
Be careful.

901
01:01:22,715 --> 01:01:26,678
- When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.
- Let's go and eat.

902
01:01:26,761 --> 01:01:31,683
By all means.
Thank you, Charlie.

903
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:35,895
Where you wanna sit, Frank, or you gonna
arrange yourself at the head again ?

904
01:01:35,978 --> 01:01:40,233
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

905
01:01:40,316 --> 01:01:43,569
[ Frank ]
Where was I ? Oh !

906
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:47,031
I wake up. It's four in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with,

907
01:01:47,115 --> 01:01:49,325
why I'm there
and where I am.

908
01:01:49,409 --> 01:01:52,370
What am I gonna do ?
I got this Asian flower,

909
01:01:52,453 --> 01:01:56,916
all giggly and dewy-like;

910
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,878
and this hard-boiled
navy nurse outta Omaha, on the other.

911
01:02:00,962 --> 01:02:05,258
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

912
01:02:05,299 --> 01:02:07,719
It comes to me.

913
01:02:07,802 --> 01:02:12,390
Let east meet west.
We'll build a golden bridge.

914
01:02:12,473 --> 01:02:14,183
[ Frank ]
Hah-hah !

915
01:02:14,267 --> 01:02:16,936
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers !

916
01:02:21,816 --> 01:02:24,485
We all still here ?

917
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:27,989
It's a beautiful story.
[ Cough ]

918
01:02:30,199 --> 01:02:34,787
- Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank ?
- Honey.

919
01:02:34,871 --> 01:02:37,165
I didn't know you were
so easily shocked.

920
01:02:37,248 --> 01:02:39,792
I admire your sensibilities.
I'm touched.

921
01:02:39,876 --> 01:02:42,920
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank...

922
01:02:43,004 --> 01:02:46,341
- to go to the kennel ?
- What about it ?

923
01:02:46,424 --> 01:02:49,719
- He almost put the seeing eye
dog business outta business.
- Cool it, Randy.

924
01:02:49,802 --> 01:02:53,973
- It's over and done with.
- Indeed it is, Garry.

925
01:02:54,057 --> 01:02:56,392
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

926
01:02:56,476 --> 01:02:59,562
Charlie, what time do you have ?
I think we better be gettin' back.

927
01:02:59,645 --> 01:03:04,567
- You ever given any thought
to a braille watch, Frank ?
- Randy.

928
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:08,613
- Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him too ?
- Honey, please.

929
01:03:08,696 --> 01:03:10,990
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's observations.

930
01:03:11,032 --> 01:03:14,994
My wife's name is Gail, Frank.
Can you hear that ? Gail.

931
01:03:15,078 --> 01:03:17,538
Excuse me.
Gail.

932
01:03:17,622 --> 01:03:21,376
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

933
01:03:21,459 --> 01:03:24,045
but there's a
little tension in her voice.

934
01:03:24,128 --> 01:03:26,923
It could be one
of two things:

935
01:03:27,006 --> 01:03:29,384
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

936
01:03:30,093 --> 01:03:33,930
What's your point,
Uncle Frank ?

937
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:36,265
You oughta go down
on her.

938
01:03:36,307 --> 01:03:38,434
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya ?

939
01:03:38,518 --> 01:03:41,896
You're so wrapped up in sugar, you've
forgotten the taste of real honey !

940
01:03:41,938 --> 01:03:43,815
Frank,
for God's sake !

941
01:03:43,898 --> 01:03:46,526
Hear that voice ?
There's fire under that dress.

942
01:03:46,609 --> 01:03:48,695
- Will you cut it out ?
- Just get the fuck outta here.

943
01:03:48,778 --> 01:03:51,197
- Whoo-ah !
- Get in your limousine.

944
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:54,450
Go down to the bowery, get with the
other fucking drunks where you belong !

945
01:03:54,534 --> 01:03:56,703
- Wait a minute.
- What ?

946
01:03:56,786 --> 01:03:59,747
- Could you take it easy ?
- What for ?

947
01:03:59,789 --> 01:04:02,291
You want me to lay off him,
Chuckie, 'cause he's blind ?

948
01:04:02,375 --> 01:04:05,336
- No, but I mean --
- My friend's name is Charles.

949
01:04:05,420 --> 01:04:07,922
He doesn't like
to be called Chuckie.

950
01:04:07,964 --> 01:04:11,634
- This is supposed to be a family
get-together. This is --
- A warning.

951
01:04:11,718 --> 01:04:15,888
Jesus Christ. Another sucker who thinks
this shitheel's a war hero.

952
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:18,850
Whoo-ah.

953
01:04:20,309 --> 01:04:23,479
Well, once... maybe.

954
01:04:23,563 --> 01:04:27,483
I suppose he told you about his days
on Lyndon Johnson's staff ?

955
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:30,153
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

956
01:04:30,236 --> 01:04:33,948
- Frank was earmarked for general.
- Earmarked, good word.

957
01:04:34,032 --> 01:04:38,202
- But Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye !
- Randy, that's enough.

958
01:04:38,286 --> 01:04:42,665
So -- What do they call it when they
give you the shaft in the military ?

959
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:47,211
- Passed over !
- Frank was passed over for promotion...

960
01:04:47,295 --> 01:04:50,715
Couple times.

961
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,887
- You want to know what happened then ?
- Will you shut your mouth ?

962
01:04:55,970 --> 01:05:00,808
- He blew himself up.
- Stop it, Randy.

963
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:04,270
Our colonel, here, had a grenade
juggling act at Fort Bragg or wherever.

964
01:05:04,354 --> 01:05:07,648
- Fort Benning.
- He was teaching hand-to-hand combat --

965
01:05:07,732 --> 01:05:11,361
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me, son.

966
01:05:11,444 --> 01:05:15,948
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act was some captain.

967
01:05:16,032 --> 01:05:18,660
- Major Vincent Squires.
- Yeah, whoever he was.

968
01:05:18,743 --> 01:05:22,246
Before going on, they'd have themselves
a lo-cal breakfast:

969
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:24,248
a Screwdriver for Frank,
Bloody Mary for his partner.

970
01:05:24,332 --> 01:05:26,167
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

971
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,545
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col.
Slade had four to his partner's one.

972
01:05:29,545 --> 01:05:31,756
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col.
Slade had four to his partner's one.

973
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:34,342
He's flying in class.
He gets all excited.

974
01:05:34,384 --> 01:05:37,053
He starts pulling
the pins out.

975
01:05:39,055 --> 01:05:41,683
[ Randy ] One grenade
got away from him.

976
01:05:41,724 --> 01:05:44,727
Boom.

977
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:48,314
The one that got away.

978
01:05:48,398 --> 01:05:52,360
Oh, the pin was in...
Frank claims.

979
01:05:52,402 --> 01:05:54,320
In or out, what
difference does it make ?

980
01:05:54,404 --> 01:05:56,614
What kind of fucking lunatic
juggles grenades ?

981
01:05:56,698 --> 01:05:59,200
Vinnie came out okay.

982
01:05:59,242 --> 01:06:01,828
And all Frank lost
was his eyesight.

983
01:06:05,081 --> 01:06:08,543
- Wanna know the truth ?
- You got a handle on that,
do you, Randy ?

984
01:06:08,626 --> 01:06:11,713
- He was an asshole before.
- Whoo-ah !

985
01:06:11,754 --> 01:06:15,591
Now all he is
is a blind asshole.

986
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:17,719
Whoo-ah.

987
01:06:24,225 --> 01:06:27,228
Hey, God's a funny guy.

988
01:06:27,311 --> 01:06:32,400
God doth have
a sense of humor.

989
01:06:32,442 --> 01:06:37,447
Maybe God thinks some
people don't deserve to see.

990
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:41,034
[ Sigh ]
Whoo-ah. Hah !

991
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:45,330
You get the point...
Chuckie ?

992
01:06:49,709 --> 01:06:52,086
- Aah !
- His name is Charles.

993
01:06:53,254 --> 01:06:55,423
You can say that,
can't you ? Charles.

994
01:06:55,465 --> 01:06:59,677
Know what this is, Randy ? It's a choke
hold I'm teaching those lieutenants.

995
01:06:59,761 --> 01:07:04,098
- Little pressure, I bust your windpipe.
- I don't care what he said.

996
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,477
- Charles.
- Just let go, please !

997
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:10,229
[ Gasping ]

998
01:07:27,497 --> 01:07:30,249
Gretchen ?

999
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:33,544
You outdid yourself.

1000
01:07:33,628 --> 01:07:36,506
If you twist my arm
hard enough,

1001
01:07:36,589 --> 01:07:39,550
we're talking
Turkey Marbella next year.

1002
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:42,762
Who knows ?

1003
01:07:45,890 --> 01:07:47,934
Frank ?

1004
01:07:48,017 --> 01:07:51,646
Good-bye, Willie.

1005
01:07:56,317 --> 01:08:00,321
I'm no fucking good...

1006
01:08:00,405 --> 01:08:03,157
and I never have been.

1007
01:08:08,371 --> 01:08:11,708
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

1008
01:08:17,338 --> 01:08:21,217
Come on.
Watch your step.

1009
01:08:22,093 --> 01:08:25,096
Hold it.

1010
01:08:37,525 --> 01:08:41,654
Nueva York, compadre.
Vamos !

1011
01:08:45,241 --> 01:08:47,410
[ Clinking ]

1012
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:27,867
You got a watch ?

1013
01:09:30,953 --> 01:09:33,206
Ah, it's 7:20.

1014
01:09:33,289 --> 01:09:37,251
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1015
01:09:37,293 --> 01:09:39,420
Yeah, in the other room.

1016
01:09:39,462 --> 01:09:42,090
Get it.

1017
01:09:44,467 --> 01:09:47,220
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1018
01:09:48,971 --> 01:09:51,432
Does it have
a second hand ?

1019
01:09:56,604 --> 01:09:58,606
Yeah.

1020
01:09:58,648 --> 01:10:00,983
Time me !

1021
01:10:27,468 --> 01:10:29,470
How long ?

1022
01:10:31,014 --> 01:10:34,642
Um... about
30 seconds.

1023
01:10:34,684 --> 01:10:38,855
- I'm rusty.
- Where did you get a gun, Colonel ?

1024
01:10:38,938 --> 01:10:41,816
Piece or weapon, Charlie,
never a gun.

1025
01:10:44,694 --> 01:10:47,071
Where did you get
the piece ?

1026
01:10:47,155 --> 01:10:51,617
I'm an officer in the
United States Army. This is my sidearm.

1027
01:10:51,701 --> 01:10:56,039
- But you're not an officer anymore.
- So I'm retired, so what ?

1028
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:59,417
An officer never
relinquishes his 45.

1029
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:03,421
Yeah, but you better relinquish it to me
or I'm gonna call Mrs. Rossi.

1030
01:11:03,504 --> 01:11:05,173
Good idea.

1031
01:11:05,256 --> 01:11:07,842
Then I'm going back
to school.

1032
01:11:07,884 --> 01:11:10,553
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1033
01:11:10,636 --> 01:11:14,223
I hope you have a wonderful trip.
That felt like 25.

1034
01:11:14,307 --> 01:11:17,060
You oughta be able to do a 45 in 25.
Did you time me ?

1035
01:11:17,143 --> 01:11:20,313
No, I did not
and I'm calling Albany.

1036
01:11:27,528 --> 01:11:30,531
That was stupid.

1037
01:11:30,615 --> 01:11:34,285
Was it ?

1038
01:11:34,369 --> 01:11:37,121
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

1039
01:11:37,205 --> 01:11:39,415
No, I'm not.

1040
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,834
- I'm outta here !
- Where you goin' ? New Hampshire ?

1041
01:11:41,876 --> 01:11:45,755
You got no money.
How you gonna do that ?

1042
01:11:45,838 --> 01:11:48,549
Mmm.

1043
01:11:48,591 --> 01:11:52,595
Karen's number
tastes like Albany. Hah !

1044
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:54,889
Fine.

1045
01:11:54,972 --> 01:11:58,226
- I'm leaving.
- Charlie ? Charlie !

1046
01:12:10,905 --> 01:12:15,368
All I want from you...
is another day.

1047
01:12:15,451 --> 01:12:17,870
For what ?

1048
01:12:19,998 --> 01:12:24,085
One last tour
of the battlefield.

1049
01:12:26,754 --> 01:12:30,216
I can get around a city
like New York,

1050
01:12:30,258 --> 01:12:32,218
but l...

1051
01:12:32,260 --> 01:12:36,139
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1052
01:12:38,307 --> 01:12:40,268
What do you say,
Charlie ?

1053
01:12:40,351 --> 01:12:43,521
What's one day...
between friends ?

1054
01:12:47,316 --> 01:12:50,278
All right. Well, say
I stay for another day.

1055
01:12:50,361 --> 01:12:52,613
Will you give me
your weapon ?

1056
01:12:52,655 --> 01:12:56,743
Oh, Charlie ! I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1057
01:12:56,826 --> 01:12:59,287
I'm not giving my
fucking gun to anyone.

1058
01:12:59,329 --> 01:13:03,916
- Now, what are you drinkin' ?
- Colonel, this -- this is unacceptable.

1059
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:08,838
Unacceptable ? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for ?

1060
01:13:08,921 --> 01:13:12,425
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy ?

1061
01:13:12,467 --> 01:13:14,510
Put in Harvard
Business School ?

1062
01:13:14,594 --> 01:13:17,180
Then give me
your bullets.

1063
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:28,358
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you ?

1064
01:13:29,942 --> 01:13:33,196
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

1065
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:35,907
So, why
should I share...

1066
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:40,244
the tribe's provisions ?

1067
01:13:40,328 --> 01:13:42,789
I mean,
there's no one...

1068
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:47,293
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1069
01:13:47,335 --> 01:13:49,504
The bullets, Colonel.

1070
01:13:49,587 --> 01:13:51,673
"The bullets, Colonel."

1071
01:13:51,756 --> 01:13:54,467
You sound like a guy in
"Lives of a Bengal Lancer."

1072
01:14:14,195 --> 01:14:16,364
What do you
give a shit for ?

1073
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,866
About what ?

1074
01:14:18,950 --> 01:14:21,119
About what ?

1075
01:14:21,202 --> 01:14:25,206
About whether I blow
my brains out or not.

1076
01:14:29,043 --> 01:14:33,172
- Because I have a conscience, you know.
- You have a conscience.

1077
01:14:33,214 --> 01:14:36,009
I forgot.

1078
01:14:37,552 --> 01:14:40,263
The Charlie Conscience.

1079
01:14:41,556 --> 01:14:45,601
Do we tell ?
Do we not tell ?

1080
01:14:45,685 --> 01:14:49,355
Do we follow the
rich boy's code or not ?

1081
01:14:49,397 --> 01:14:52,483
Do we let this
blind asshole...

1082
01:14:52,567 --> 01:14:55,236
die... or not ?

1083
01:14:55,278 --> 01:14:56,821
Yeah.

1084
01:14:56,904 --> 01:14:59,032
Conscience, Charlie.

1085
01:14:59,073 --> 01:15:01,534
When were you born, son ?

1086
01:15:01,576 --> 01:15:05,538
Around the time
of the Round Table ? Hah.

1087
01:15:05,621 --> 01:15:07,749
Haven't you heard ?

1088
01:15:07,832 --> 01:15:11,044
Conscience is dead.

1089
01:15:11,085 --> 01:15:13,796
No, I haven't heard.

1090
01:15:13,880 --> 01:15:18,926
Well, then, take the
fucking wax outta your ears !

1091
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:20,928
Grow up !

1092
01:15:32,482 --> 01:15:35,610
It's fuck your buddy.

1093
01:15:35,693 --> 01:15:38,696
Cheat on your wife.

1094
01:15:40,740 --> 01:15:44,410
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

1095
01:15:45,453 --> 01:15:50,416
Charlie,
it's all shit.

1096
01:16:00,218 --> 01:16:02,470
Where you goin' ?

1097
01:16:02,512 --> 01:16:06,099
I got piss call.

1098
01:16:06,182 --> 01:16:10,019
I know I said I need ya
for just one day,

1099
01:16:10,103 --> 01:16:12,563
but even I can't hold it
that long.

1100
01:16:14,816 --> 01:16:17,235
Oh, and, Charlie,

1101
01:16:17,318 --> 01:16:19,946
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

1102
01:16:25,618 --> 01:16:27,537
Hah !

1103
01:16:27,620 --> 01:16:29,998
There you go,
sir.

1104
01:16:30,081 --> 01:16:31,916
Thank you.

1105
01:16:35,169 --> 01:16:38,339
Twenty-six years
in the service,

1106
01:16:38,423 --> 01:16:40,675
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

1107
01:16:40,758 --> 01:16:44,303
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie ?

1108
01:16:44,387 --> 01:16:48,307
Playing golf with your friends
from the Baird School, I bet.

1109
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:53,521
I don't even like
those guys.

1110
01:16:53,563 --> 01:16:56,816
Course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1111
01:16:56,858 --> 01:16:59,902
Be a pleasure to squeal
on 'em, wouldn't it ?

1112
01:16:59,986 --> 01:17:04,407
- Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.
- "I'm not a squealer."

1113
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:06,576
What is this,
the Dreyfus case ?

1114
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:13,207
Ohh ! Ooh, Mama !

1115
01:17:13,291 --> 01:17:15,543
There you go.

1116
01:17:15,626 --> 01:17:18,546
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1117
01:17:18,629 --> 01:17:20,590
Watch your step.

1118
01:17:23,509 --> 01:17:26,888
I'm gettin' that
heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1119
01:17:29,599 --> 01:17:33,603
There's more to this,
isn't there ?

1120
01:17:33,686 --> 01:17:35,772
Isn't there ?

1121
01:17:38,149 --> 01:17:41,986
- I was offered a bribe.
- Oh, now we're cookin'.

1122
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:46,199
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

1123
01:17:47,241 --> 01:17:50,078
he promised to
get me into Harvard.

1124
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:53,414
- If you squeal.
- Yeah.

1125
01:17:53,498 --> 01:17:55,792
What a dilemma.

1126
01:17:55,875 --> 01:18:01,255
Should Charlie Simms accept a
free ride into Harvard or not ?

1127
01:18:01,339 --> 01:18:05,426
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes ?

1128
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:07,595
- He is, practically.
- How ?

1129
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:12,433
I mean, it's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get him into Harvard.

1130
01:18:12,517 --> 01:18:16,771
Mr. Trask doesn't have to. George's
father's gonna take care of that.

1131
01:18:18,856 --> 01:18:21,651
Do the deal, Charlie.
Take it !

1132
01:18:21,734 --> 01:18:24,195
Go to Harvard.

1133
01:18:24,278 --> 01:18:27,115
- I can't do that.
- Why not ?

1134
01:18:29,033 --> 01:18:32,495
It's just some things
you just can't do.

1135
01:18:32,578 --> 01:18:34,956
Explain 'em to me.

1136
01:18:35,999 --> 01:18:40,753
- Louder, please.
- I, l, I can't --

1137
01:18:40,795 --> 01:18:44,007
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1138
01:18:45,341 --> 01:18:49,804
To ease the blow,
let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1139
01:18:50,096 --> 01:18:52,598
[ Frank ] Double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

1140
01:18:52,682 --> 01:18:56,978
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1141
01:18:57,020 --> 01:18:59,063
Hold on.
Do you have beer ?

1142
01:18:59,147 --> 01:19:01,691
Certainly.
May I see some I.D. ?

1143
01:19:01,774 --> 01:19:04,986
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy ?

1144
01:19:05,028 --> 01:19:06,320
Sir, but --

1145
01:19:06,404 --> 01:19:09,907
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1146
01:19:09,991 --> 01:19:12,785
Why don't you call up front,
the office ?

1147
01:19:12,827 --> 01:19:16,289
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1148
01:19:16,372 --> 01:19:19,500
Any particular beer ?

1149
01:19:19,584 --> 01:19:22,879
Schlitz.
No Schlitz ?

1150
01:19:22,962 --> 01:19:25,381
Blatz.
No Blatz ?

1151
01:19:25,465 --> 01:19:27,842
Improvise.

1152
01:19:27,884 --> 01:19:31,137
- I'll do my best, sir.
- [ Frank ] Thank you, sir.

1153
01:19:32,847 --> 01:19:36,642
You're human, Charlie.
Beer ?

1154
01:19:39,062 --> 01:19:41,230
Who are we
drinking with ?

1155
01:19:41,314 --> 01:19:45,818
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1156
01:19:52,492 --> 01:19:56,162
- Ah... female.
- Female ?

1157
01:19:56,245 --> 01:20:00,667
You're callin' her female, must mean you
like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1158
01:20:03,336 --> 01:20:06,964
- Is she alone ?
- Yeah, she's alone.

1159
01:20:09,258 --> 01:20:12,512
Things are heatin' up.
Chestnut hair ?

1160
01:20:12,595 --> 01:20:15,932
Brown...
Light brown.

1161
01:20:16,015 --> 01:20:19,227
Twenty-two ?

1162
01:20:21,270 --> 01:20:23,606
Wh-- What am l,
a guy at a carnival ?

1163
01:20:23,690 --> 01:20:27,652
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1164
01:20:27,735 --> 01:20:29,987
Move.

1165
01:20:30,071 --> 01:20:32,281
- Where ?
- You know where, son.

1166
01:20:32,365 --> 01:20:34,659
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1167
01:20:35,952 --> 01:20:38,871
This woman is made for you.
I can feel it.

1168
01:20:38,955 --> 01:20:41,207
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she ?

1169
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:45,920
- She's not bad.
- Whoo-bingo ! The boy's alive.

1170
01:20:46,004 --> 01:20:49,632
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1171
01:20:49,716 --> 01:20:53,386
Perambulate.

1172
01:21:00,893 --> 01:21:04,814
Excuse me, senorita,
do you mind if we join you ?

1173
01:21:06,190 --> 01:21:08,276
I'm feelin'
you're being neglected.

1174
01:21:08,359 --> 01:21:11,946
Well, I'm
expecting somebody.

1175
01:21:11,988 --> 01:21:15,241
Instantly ?

1176
01:21:15,325 --> 01:21:19,537
- No, but any minute now.
- Any minute ?

1177
01:21:19,620 --> 01:21:22,290
Some people live a lifetime
in a minute.

1178
01:21:24,167 --> 01:21:28,463
- What are you doin' right now ?
- I'm waiting for him.

1179
01:21:28,546 --> 01:21:31,632
Would you mind
if we waited with you,

1180
01:21:31,674 --> 01:21:35,845
you know, just to keep the
womanizers from bothering you ?

1181
01:21:38,931 --> 01:21:40,892
No, I don't mind.

1182
01:21:40,975 --> 01:21:43,644
Thank you.

1183
01:21:45,980 --> 01:21:47,940
Charlie.

1184
01:21:51,235 --> 01:21:54,614
You know, I detect...
a fragrance in the air.

1185
01:21:54,697 --> 01:21:57,075
Don't tell me
what it is.

1186
01:21:57,158 --> 01:21:59,369
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1187
01:21:59,452 --> 01:22:02,664
Ah, that's amazing.

1188
01:22:02,747 --> 01:22:04,999
I'm in the amazing
business !

1189
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,043
It is
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1190
01:22:07,126 --> 01:22:10,421
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1191
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:12,715
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

1192
01:22:12,799 --> 01:22:15,593
I think she'd have liked
Charlie too.

1193
01:22:15,677 --> 01:22:17,970
- Don't pay any attention to him.
- What's your name ?

1194
01:22:18,054 --> 01:22:19,555
Donna.

1195
01:22:19,639 --> 01:22:24,352
- Donna ? I'm Frank. This here is --
- This is Charlie.

1196
01:22:24,435 --> 01:22:26,562
Yes. She likes you.

1197
01:22:26,646 --> 01:22:29,857
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.
He's going through a crisis.

1198
01:22:29,941 --> 01:22:32,694
How does he look
like he's holding up ?

1199
01:22:32,777 --> 01:22:35,738
He looks fine to me.

1200
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:38,241
Oh ! She does
like you, Charlie.

1201
01:22:42,912 --> 01:22:45,164
So, Donna,

1202
01:22:45,248 --> 01:22:46,958
ah...

1203
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:49,043
do you tango ?

1204
01:22:49,127 --> 01:22:52,714
No. I wanted
to learn once, but --

1205
01:22:52,797 --> 01:22:55,174
But ?

1206
01:22:55,258 --> 01:22:57,844
But Michael
didn't want to.

1207
01:22:57,927 --> 01:23:01,305
Michael, the one
you're waiting for.

1208
01:23:01,389 --> 01:23:05,101
Michael thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1209
01:23:05,184 --> 01:23:08,438
Well, I think
Michael's hysterical.

1210
01:23:08,521 --> 01:23:11,733
Don't pay any attention to him.
Did I already say that ?

1211
01:23:13,651 --> 01:23:16,154
What a beautiful laugh.

1212
01:23:17,655 --> 01:23:19,657
Thank you, Frank.

1213
01:23:24,412 --> 01:23:27,540
Would you like to learn
to tango, Donna ?

1214
01:23:30,626 --> 01:23:32,628
Right now ?

1215
01:23:32,670 --> 01:23:37,342
I'm offering you my services...
free of charge.

1216
01:23:37,425 --> 01:23:39,385
What do you say ?

1217
01:23:39,469 --> 01:23:41,262
Ah...

1218
01:23:41,346 --> 01:23:44,474
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1219
01:23:44,557 --> 01:23:46,726
Of what ?

1220
01:23:46,809 --> 01:23:51,064
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1221
01:23:51,147 --> 01:23:55,443
No mistakes in the tango,
not like life.

1222
01:23:55,526 --> 01:23:58,112
It's simple. That's what makes
the tango so great.

1223
01:23:58,196 --> 01:24:03,034
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

1224
01:24:03,117 --> 01:24:06,621
[ Frank ]
Why don't you try ?

1225
01:24:10,416 --> 01:24:13,044
Will you try it ?

1226
01:24:13,127 --> 01:24:16,631
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1227
01:24:16,714 --> 01:24:19,384
Hold me down, son.

1228
01:24:26,432 --> 01:24:28,893
Your arm.

1229
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:33,314
Charlie,

1230
01:24:33,398 --> 01:24:35,942
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1231
01:24:36,025 --> 01:24:38,986
The floor's
about 20 by 30,

1232
01:24:39,070 --> 01:24:42,031
And you're at
the long end.

1233
01:24:42,115 --> 01:24:46,119
There's tables on the outside.
The band's on the right.

1234
01:27:24,944 --> 01:27:29,615
Oh, Frank, you are
one incredible dancer.

1235
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:35,830
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1236
01:27:35,913 --> 01:27:39,042
- He's a liar. I don't dance.
- Isn't he a charmer, though ?

1237
01:27:39,125 --> 01:27:43,296
Truth is, not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1238
01:27:43,379 --> 01:27:46,049
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1239
01:27:46,132 --> 01:27:48,176
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1240
01:27:48,259 --> 01:27:51,888
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1241
01:27:51,971 --> 01:27:55,600
-Hi, Frank, Charlie. I'm sorry I'm late.
-Oh, that's okay.

1242
01:27:55,683 --> 01:27:58,394
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1243
01:27:58,436 --> 01:28:01,064
and time flew.

1244
01:28:01,147 --> 01:28:04,942
Your girl is...
a hell of a tango dancer.

1245
01:28:05,026 --> 01:28:07,653
You found someone to tango with.
That's terrific !

1246
01:28:07,737 --> 01:28:09,739
Let me
shake your hand.

1247
01:28:09,822 --> 01:28:13,076
- No, it was Frank.
- Hell, I'll shake both your hands !

1248
01:28:14,577 --> 01:28:17,372
Honey, this looks like the place,
but we gotta go.

1249
01:28:17,455 --> 01:28:20,541
We got a date with Darryl
and Carol in the village.

1250
01:28:20,625 --> 01:28:22,543
Do you have a check ?

1251
01:28:22,627 --> 01:28:27,298
- Michael, please. My pleasure.
- No, no. I got this.

1252
01:28:27,382 --> 01:28:30,218
Michael, get your hand outta
your pocket. I'll take it. Really.

1253
01:28:30,301 --> 01:28:33,805
Allow me.

1254
01:28:33,888 --> 01:28:36,432
Why, thank you.

1255
01:28:36,474 --> 01:28:38,476
Bye, guys.

1256
01:28:38,518 --> 01:28:40,687
Bye.

1257
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:51,698
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1258
01:28:59,664 --> 01:29:02,959
[ Manny ] It's Apartment 17 E, Colonel.
She's expecting you.

1259
01:29:03,042 --> 01:29:06,963
You don't have to worry about a thing.
She's the creme de la creme.

1260
01:29:07,005 --> 01:29:09,507
My buddy took the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1261
01:29:09,590 --> 01:29:12,010
Now he wants to immigrate
to this country.

1262
01:29:12,093 --> 01:29:14,137
[ Frank ]
You did good, hombre.

1263
01:29:16,514 --> 01:29:19,350
My hair,
how is it ?

1264
01:29:19,392 --> 01:29:21,352
It's perfect.

1265
01:29:24,188 --> 01:29:28,401
- I got the red foulard okay, didn't I ?
- Yeah, real dark red.

1266
01:29:28,484 --> 01:29:30,862
Burgundy, Charlie,
burgundy.

1267
01:29:30,945 --> 01:29:33,823
They love it.

1268
01:29:33,865 --> 01:29:36,492
Bay Rum.

1269
01:29:37,493 --> 01:29:40,538
Windsor knot.

1270
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:43,499
[ Sigh ] That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

1271
01:29:52,258 --> 01:29:54,260
I'm off.

1272
01:30:12,445 --> 01:30:14,405
Can you get long distance
on this ?

1273
01:30:14,489 --> 01:30:16,491
And how.
Be my guest.

1274
01:30:27,960 --> 01:30:30,838
- Sugarbush lodge.
- Hi. George Willis, please ?

1275
01:30:30,922 --> 01:30:33,508
One moment, please.

1276
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:36,260
- Hello ?
- Ah, Harry ?

1277
01:30:36,344 --> 01:30:38,596
Chas, how are you ?

1278
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,849
You just caught us. We're about
to shoot George over to the airport.

1279
01:30:41,933 --> 01:30:44,769
Why is George
going to the airport ?

1280
01:30:44,811 --> 01:30:48,189
Um, hold on. Maybe you should talk
to the man himself.

1281
01:30:49,482 --> 01:30:51,526
- Chas.
- Yeah. Hi, George.

1282
01:30:51,609 --> 01:30:55,571
- You just caught me.
- Harry said. Where you goin' ?

1283
01:30:55,655 --> 01:30:58,157
- Home.
- To Boston ?

1284
01:30:58,241 --> 01:31:01,119
Catching the puddle jumper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1285
01:31:01,202 --> 01:31:04,706
What are you
going home for ?

1286
01:31:04,789 --> 01:31:08,543
[ Sigh ] I was thinking, Chas.
This asshole, Trask ?

1287
01:31:08,626 --> 01:31:11,295
He's making
no sense at all.

1288
01:31:11,379 --> 01:31:15,133
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father's Class of '59.

1289
01:31:15,174 --> 01:31:19,012
Your father ? I thought we were
gonna keep our parents outta this.

1290
01:31:19,095 --> 01:31:23,349
This guy Trask is outta control, Chas.
Outta control !

1291
01:31:23,433 --> 01:31:25,727
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.

1292
01:31:25,810 --> 01:31:29,772
- My father's a major
fund-raiser, you know.
- No, I didn't.

1293
01:31:29,856 --> 01:31:33,609
Just relax.
He'll get us off the hook.

1294
01:31:33,693 --> 01:31:36,821
- I gotta go. Everything all right ?
- Sure.

1295
01:31:36,904 --> 01:31:40,783
- I'll see you Monday. Good-bye.
- Bye.

1296
01:32:05,058 --> 01:32:07,518
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1297
01:32:19,405 --> 01:32:21,366
Hiya, Charlie.

1298
01:32:22,909 --> 01:32:24,911
Watch the door.

1299
01:32:42,804 --> 01:32:45,348
What a beautiful woman.

1300
01:32:58,569 --> 01:33:02,532
- Hello, there.
- Do you see what I see ?

1301
01:33:02,615 --> 01:33:05,743
[ TV ] Yeah.
Either there's something wrong,

1302
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:08,246
or we got the
world's worst hangover.

1303
01:33:08,329 --> 01:33:12,500
Won't you come in ?

1304
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,544
[ TV Off ]

1305
01:33:30,518 --> 01:33:32,478
Colonel ?

1306
01:33:45,074 --> 01:33:48,369
Colonel,
you all right ?

1307
01:33:48,453 --> 01:33:51,289
What is there ?

1308
01:33:54,876 --> 01:34:00,089
It's afternoon.
You've been sleeping all morning.

1309
01:34:00,173 --> 01:34:02,800
So what ?

1310
01:34:02,884 --> 01:34:06,512
I don't know.
I thought --

1311
01:34:10,892 --> 01:34:12,935
I-l talked to George
last night.

1312
01:34:13,019 --> 01:34:15,229
His, ah --

1313
01:34:15,313 --> 01:34:19,692
His father's a big-deal alumnus
at school. He's got a lot of pull.

1314
01:34:19,776 --> 01:34:22,820
Really ?

1315
01:34:22,904 --> 01:34:26,658
Yeah, he's, ah,

1316
01:34:26,741 --> 01:34:29,035
he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1317
01:34:29,118 --> 01:34:32,413
George thinks he might
be able to get us off the hook.

1318
01:34:32,497 --> 01:34:35,166
"Get us off the hook."

1319
01:34:35,249 --> 01:34:38,002
Yeah, that's --
that's what he said.

1320
01:34:38,044 --> 01:34:41,881
Watch the "us" part.

1321
01:34:43,716 --> 01:34:46,552
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something ?

1322
01:34:46,636 --> 01:34:49,597
[ Groan ]

1323
01:34:50,765 --> 01:34:52,600
Colonel ?

1324
01:34:52,684 --> 01:34:56,270
Oh, Charlie,
what do ya want ?

1325
01:34:56,354 --> 01:34:58,314
I don't know !

1326
01:34:58,398 --> 01:35:01,526
But you're
making me nervous.

1327
01:35:04,487 --> 01:35:07,657
My wallet is on
the dresser.

1328
01:35:07,740 --> 01:35:09,951
Take out
your plane ticket...

1329
01:35:10,034 --> 01:35:14,872
and $400
mustering-out pay,

1330
01:35:14,914 --> 01:35:17,333
plus...

1331
01:35:17,417 --> 01:35:21,796
airport-to-school taxi.

1332
01:35:23,256 --> 01:35:26,342
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can --

1333
01:35:26,426 --> 01:35:28,428
I could stay
for a while.

1334
01:35:28,511 --> 01:35:32,390
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

1335
01:35:32,432 --> 01:35:36,394
For that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1336
01:35:38,187 --> 01:35:42,900
But right now I have...
other plans.

1337
01:35:42,984 --> 01:35:45,611
What other plans
do you have ?

1338
01:35:47,739 --> 01:35:49,741
To die, son.

1339
01:35:49,824 --> 01:35:53,953
Colonel, you're --

1340
01:35:54,037 --> 01:35:56,748
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1341
01:35:56,789 --> 01:36:00,585
Charlie,
give me your hand.

1342
01:36:04,464 --> 01:36:07,091
You go now, boy.
Okay ?

1343
01:36:08,926 --> 01:36:11,971
You go.
Just, uh --

1344
01:36:14,557 --> 01:36:16,893
Just leave me
sleep here.

1345
01:36:17,977 --> 01:36:21,147
Look, uh --
Can we start over, please ?

1346
01:36:21,230 --> 01:36:25,443
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh ?

1347
01:36:25,526 --> 01:36:28,029
I mean, look at this.
The sun is shining !

1348
01:36:28,112 --> 01:36:30,573
It's a beautiful day.
Let's --

1349
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:37,413
Colonel, I know you don't want
to be a party poop,

1350
01:36:37,497 --> 01:36:41,501
so let's go out and do something, huh ?
Let's go for a ride.

1351
01:36:46,756 --> 01:36:48,883
Yeah, a ride.

1352
01:36:48,966 --> 01:36:52,178
A ride ?

1353
01:36:52,261 --> 01:36:55,973
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say ?

1354
01:36:56,057 --> 01:36:59,102
Let's go for a ride,
huh ?

1355
01:37:05,858 --> 01:37:08,194
What kind of ride ?

1356
01:37:09,612 --> 01:37:11,823
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1357
01:37:12,365 --> 01:37:15,827
and we let appropriate customers
test-drive the Testarossa.

1358
01:37:15,910 --> 01:37:19,914
But you're 17 and with
a blind companion. That we don't do.

1359
01:37:19,998 --> 01:37:22,917
This is a $190,000
piece of machinery.

1360
01:37:23,001 --> 01:37:26,379
- I'm not letting it out this door.
- How 'bout this one over here ?

1361
01:37:26,462 --> 01:37:29,298
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1362
01:37:29,382 --> 01:37:33,678
Think I'm gonna let an unaccompanied kid
get behind the wheel of a $110,000 car ?

1363
01:37:33,761 --> 01:37:36,264
He will not be
unaccompanied.

1364
01:37:36,347 --> 01:37:39,934
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1365
01:37:40,018 --> 01:37:42,979
- You're his father ?
- Yes.

1366
01:37:43,062 --> 01:37:46,357
I have an idea. Why don't I take
your father for a test-drive ?

1367
01:37:46,441 --> 01:37:50,361
- What's your quota, Freddie ?
- Don't worry about my quota. I do well.

1368
01:37:50,403 --> 01:37:52,447
How many Ferraris
you sold this month ?

1369
01:37:52,530 --> 01:37:55,199
That's not relevant
to this discussion.

1370
01:37:55,283 --> 01:37:57,368
Freddie,
the 80s are over.

1371
01:37:57,452 --> 01:38:00,163
Are you tryin' to tell me
these are just walkin' outta the store ?

1372
01:38:00,246 --> 01:38:04,417
This is a Ferrari, the finest machinery

- Good-bye.

1525
01:50:46,040 --> 01:50:49,210
Colonel, are you
looking at me ?

1526
01:50:52,088 --> 01:50:55,174
I'm blind, Charlie.

1527
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:03,307
I'm gonna take a nap.

1528
01:51:04,892 --> 01:51:07,311
Too much fresh air.

1529
01:51:07,395 --> 01:51:09,981
It's probably
a good idea.

1530
01:51:11,274 --> 01:51:14,235
Want me to help you
to your room ?

1531
01:51:14,277 --> 01:51:16,612
No.

Couch.

1533
01:51:18,948 --> 01:51:22,243
I like
this couch here.

1534
01:51:24,203 --> 01:51:26,539
You sure you're
all right, Colonel ?

1535
01:51:26,622 --> 01:51:28,583
I got a headache.

1536

[ Sigh ]

1537

Why don't you go downstairs,
get me some Aspirin, Charlie ?

1538
01:51:37,800 --> 01:51:42,138
- Some Aspirin.
- Yeah. Also...

1539
01:51:43,681 --> 01:51:46,809
I feel like
a cigar.

1540
01:51:46,893 --> 01:51:51,439
Get me a couple of
Monte Cristos, number one.

1541
01:51:51,480 --> 01:51:53,983
- Monte Cristos, number one.
- Yeah.

1542
01:51:54,066 --> 01:51:56,903
You won't be able to get 'em
at the newsstand downstairs.

1543
01:51:56,986 --> 01:51:59,739
So why don't you
go over to...

Tell him, um,
they're for me.

1547

He'll know.

You're back
too fast.

1549

You didn't get
my cigars, did you ?

1550

Get out of here,
Charlie.

1551

I thought we had a deal.

1552
01:53:21,571 --> 01:53:26,993
I welched. I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you ?

1553
01:53:27,076 --> 01:53:30,621
No, what you told me was that
you gave me all the bullets.

1554
01:53:30,705 --> 01:53:33,165
I lied.

1555
01:53:34,959 --> 01:53:37,879
- Yeah, well, you could have fooled me.
- And I did.

1556
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:44,677
Charlie, how you ever gonna survive
in this world without me ?

1557

Why don't you just
give me the gun, all right ?

Wh-- What are you doing ?

1559
01:54:04,780 --> 01:54:06,824
I'm gonna
shoot you too.

Your life's finished anyway.

1561

Your friend George's gonna
sing like a canary.

And so are you.

1563
01:54:17,835 --> 01:54:20,588
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1564
01:54:20,671 --> 01:54:24,842
you're gonna take your place
on that long, gray line...

of American manhood.

1566

And you will be through.

1567
01:54:31,724 --> 01:54:34,060
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

1568
01:54:34,143 --> 01:54:37,063
You're in no position
to disagree with me, boy.

1569
01:54:37,146 --> 01:54:40,608
I got a loaded .45 here.
You got pimples.

an ultimatum ?

You break my heart, son.

important.

You got integrity, Charlie.

I don't know whether
to shoot ya or adopt ya.

1586

Not much of a choice,
is it, sir ?

Aw, don't get cute now.

- Colonel, please put the gun away ?
- I asked you a question.

Do you want me to adopt ya,
or don't ya ?

Not an isolated case
of vandalism, what happened...

is a symptom
of the sickness of a society,

counter to the principles...

- disrespect for our values...

for our standards,

a disrespect for
the Baird tradition.

And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

I saw something,

1833

- You couldn't say or you wouldn't say ?

Well, I just --
I --

02:18:28,795 --> 02:18:31,297
- I just couldn't say. I'm --
- Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

1838

You're exhausting
my patience...

1839
02:18:33,341 --> 02:18:35,551
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

The consequences of your response
will be dire.

By dire I mean your future
will be jeopardized permanently.

their size and shape ?

Yeah.

And they were
the size and shape of whom ?

02:27:20,994 --> 02:27:23,371
They have come
to a decision.

1985
02:27:23,454 --> 02:27:26,082
Misters Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson...

1986
02:27:26,165 --> 02:27:28,126
are placed
on probation...

1987
02:27:28,167 --> 02:27:32,005
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

1988
02:27:32,088 --> 02:27:35,383
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr....

1989
02:27:35,466 --> 02:27:38,678
receive neither recognition
nor commendation...

1990
02:27:38,761 --> 02:27:41,055
for his cooperation.

1991
02:27:41,139 --> 02:27:44,100
Mr. Charles Simms
is excused...

1992
02:27:44,183 --> 02:27:47,020
from any further response
to this incident.

1993
02:27:47,103 --> 02:27:49,731
- Whoo-ah.
- [ Cheering And Applause ]

1994
02:28:25,892 --> 02:28:27,977
Charlie !

1995
02:28:47,955 --> 02:28:52,126
- Last step.
- I can always count on you, Charlie.

1996
02:28:54,671 --> 02:28:56,964
[ Woman ]
Colonel.

1997
02:28:57,048 --> 02:28:59,050
Colonel !

1998
02:28:59,133 --> 02:29:01,260
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

1999
02:29:01,344 --> 02:29:03,262
I teach
Political Science.

2000
02:29:03,346 --> 02:29:05,556
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate...

2001
02:29:05,640 --> 02:29:08,184
- your coming here
and speaking your mind.
- Thank you. Are you married ?

2002
02:29:08,267 --> 02:29:11,104
Uh --
I, uh --

2003
02:29:12,730 --> 02:29:16,484
Went to a artillery school
at Fort Sill with a Mickey Downes.

2004
02:29:16,567 --> 02:29:18,486
Thought he might've
snagged you.

2005
02:29:18,569 --> 02:29:21,739
Uh, no, no,
I'm afraid not.

2006
02:29:21,823 --> 02:29:24,200
Uh, Colonel Slade was on, uh,

2007
02:29:24,283 --> 02:29:26,285
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

2008
02:29:26,369 --> 02:29:29,038
Were you ? Fascinating.

2009
02:29:29,122 --> 02:29:31,833
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2010
02:29:35,044 --> 02:29:36,963
Fleurs de rocailles.

2011
02:29:39,132 --> 02:29:41,092
Yes.

2012

"Flowers from a brook."

2013
02:29:45,430 --> 02:29:47,640
That's right.

2014
02:29:50,268 --> 02:29:52,895
Well, Miss Downes,

2015
02:29:52,937 --> 02:29:56,399
I, I'll know
where to find you.

2016
02:29:56,482 --> 02:29:58,443
Charlie.

2017
02:29:58,484 --> 02:30:00,737
- [ Charlie ] Bye, Miss Downes.
- Bye.

2018
02:30:03,656 --> 02:30:07,368
You don't have
to tell me, Charlie.

2019
02:30:07,452 --> 02:30:10,246
5'7",

2020
02:30:10,330 --> 02:30:12,957
auburn hair,

2021
02:30:13,041 --> 02:30:16,502
beautiful
brown eyes.

2022
02:30:33,895 --> 02:30:36,105
Yabba dabba doo.

2023
02:30:37,190 --> 02:30:39,150
Hah !

2024
02:30:40,485 --> 02:30:42,612
Manny.

2025
02:30:43,946 --> 02:30:45,865
Aw, Colonel,
this is too much.

2026
02:30:45,948 --> 02:30:48,660
You earned it.
Next time Charlie and l...

2027
02:30:48,743 --> 02:30:51,537
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2028
02:30:51,621 --> 02:30:53,539
You can drive us
both ways.

2029
02:30:53,623 --> 02:30:56,250
You're on. Not only
will it be an honor,

2030
02:30:56,334 --> 02:30:58,252
I'll give you
a rate.

2031
02:30:58,336 --> 02:31:01,089
I'll see your rate
and raise you.

2032
02:31:01,172 --> 02:31:03,132
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

2033
02:31:03,174 --> 02:31:06,302
- Take care, Colonel.
- You too.

2034
02:31:06,386 --> 02:31:09,847
- Ready ?
- No, thanks, Charlie.
I'll take it from here.

2035
02:31:09,889 --> 02:31:13,851
You go on ahead.
Manny'll drive you back to your dorm.

2036
02:31:13,935 --> 02:31:17,188
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

2037
02:31:17,271 --> 02:31:19,649
We'll have a little cheer.

2038
02:31:19,691 --> 02:31:22,485
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

2039
02:31:22,527 --> 02:31:25,113
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

2040
02:31:25,196 --> 02:31:27,115
It's almost edible.

2041
02:31:28,366 --> 02:31:30,284
All right, Colonel.

2042
02:31:30,368 --> 02:31:32,161
- That'd be really --
- Bye, Charlie.

2043
02:31:52,724 --> 02:31:54,684
Who's there ?

2044
02:31:54,726 --> 02:31:57,228
- That you, Francine ?
- Yes.

2045
02:31:57,270 --> 02:32:00,565
- What are you doing ?
- Taking a ride.

2046
02:32:00,648 --> 02:32:04,027
Taking a ride ?
What about you giving me a lift ?

2047
02:32:04,110 --> 02:32:07,363
- No.
- No ?

2048
02:32:07,405 --> 02:32:09,991
Aw, come on,
Francine.

2049
02:32:10,074 --> 02:32:13,369
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up ?

2050
02:32:13,453 --> 02:32:15,830
- [ Francine ] No.
- [ Slade ] Francine ?

2051
02:32:15,913 --> 02:32:17,832
- What ?
- Your Uncle Frank's had himself...

2052
02:32:17,915 --> 02:32:22,503
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2053
02:32:22,587 --> 02:32:24,505
- [ Willie Muttering ]
- What's that ?

2054
02:32:24,589 --> 02:32:26,799
I hear a chipmunk.

2055
02:32:26,883 --> 02:32:28,843
Is it a walrus ?

2056
02:32:28,926 --> 02:32:30,845
No, it's Willie.

2057
02:32:30,928 --> 02:32:33,681
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag ?

2058
02:32:33,765 --> 02:32:36,601
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2059
02:32:36,684 --> 02:32:38,936
Come on. Come on.

2060
02:32:39,020 --> 02:32:41,814
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong.

2061
02:32:41,898 --> 02:32:44,067
Come on.

2062
02:32:45,276 --> 02:32:47,779
Here we are.

2063
02:32:47,862 --> 02:32:50,323
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

2064
02:32:50,406 --> 02:32:53,201
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2065
02:32:53,284 --> 02:32:56,037
- Whaddaya say ?
- Okay.
