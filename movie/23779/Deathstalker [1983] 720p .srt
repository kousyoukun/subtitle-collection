1
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,121
No! No!

2
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:51,503
No! God, no!

3
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:52,796
No!

4
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:42,095
That's my horse.

5
00:03:57,946 --> 00:04:00,656
Our fight is not with you.

6
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,761
I've taken some treasure here.

7
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,180
And a girl from the valley.
I'll share them with you.

8
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,308
The one who lives here
won't be very pleased.

9
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,060
Let him fight for it, then.

10
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,941
Take it all. It's yours.

11
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,026
Take it!

12
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,445
I intend to.

13
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,508
This just isn't your day, is it?

14
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,843
What do you want?

15
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,261
Your name.

16
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,350
Outside...

17
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,394
Wait for me there.

18
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,358
Fuck.

19
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:29,948
This isn't my day, either.

20
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,533
Get any poorer.

21
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,327
You're gonna have to
eat that dog.

22
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:19,372
I hope it'll be as tasty
as the one you're enjoying.

23
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,501
Real kings Iive in castles.

24
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,294
Like Lord Munkar.

25
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:25,879
Munkar was my magician.

26
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,381
That castle was mine
and will be again.

27
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,301
It is said that once

28
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,552
an entire army marched
against him.

29
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,180
A real army.

30
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:36,973
Munkar waved his hand

31
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,892
and turned the whole army
into a flock of sheep.

32
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,645
An army isn't the way.

33
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,898
A brave man could get
inside Munkar's castle

34
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,650
and kill him.

35
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:48,985
You need a fool.

36
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,237
No.

37
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,530
A hero.

38
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,958
Heroes and fools...

39
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,335
...are the same thing.

40
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:07,712
I'll offer you anything you like!

41
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,674
Even all this isn't worth much
to a sheep.

42
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,551
I'll give you position.

43
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,262
You can stop living
like an outlaw.

44
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,222
An outlaw is free.

45
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,683
He's taken my daughter from me.

46
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,229
In olden times,
there were great heroes.

47
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,523
Men who'd ride off
to save a maiden

48
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,358
with never a thought
to their own lives.

49
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,360
Well, those days are gone.

50
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,238
I steal and kill to stay aIive.

51
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,282
Not for the luxury of glory.

52
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,275
Things have changed
since your father's reign.

53
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,694
Haven't they, Princess?

54
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,796
I want the sword.

55
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,844
I am Kang.

56
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:04,222
General of the great
Lord Munkar.

57
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,266
It's your duty to give up
the sword.

58
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,183
Be on your way.

59
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,893
I will not give you the sword.

60
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,729
My Lord!

61
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,400
Hyah! Hyah!

62
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,944
Taste of my magic, Kang.

63
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:27,704
Hyah!

64
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,816
Your powers are nothing
without the sword, Kang.

65
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,151
Or is it, Munkar?

66
00:13:05,075 --> 00:13:08,870
With this amuIet,
the life blood of generations,

67
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,707
I change my form
and slip your grasp.

68
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,513
Get the amulet.

69
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,473
-He is heIpless without it-

70
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,641
Hurry!

71
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,273
Lord Munkar's sorcery-.-
reaches even here.

72
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,616
What was that amulet?

73
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,995
It is one
of the Three Powers of Creation.

74
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,206
Munkar controls two powers.

75
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,875
He came here as Kang
to get the sword.

76
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,669
The sword?

77
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,633
Join three things separate
to be the power.

78
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,933
More powerful than Munkar.

79
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,520
Toralva, don't talk to me
in riddles.

80
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,939
Just as the amulet
is the key to life

81
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:21,150
so the sword is the instrument
of justice.

82
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,194
I will tell you how to find it.

83
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,614
With your strength and courage,
Deathstalker,

84
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,533
you can use the power
in the sword

85
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:29,576
to get the amulet.

86
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,745
He who wears it cannot die.

87
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,164
With sword and amulet,

88
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,583
you can take the chalice,

89
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:39,460
and reunite
the Three Powers of Creation.

90
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,005
Look! Let me show you.

91
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,804
Munkar already holds
the first two powers.

92
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,057
The Amulet of Life
and the Chalice of Magic.

93
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,523
You are very close now
to the power, Deathstalker.

94
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,236
But it will not be yours
for long.

95
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:13,536
The power wiIl come
to he who becomes a chiId.

96
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,704
Toralva,

97
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,248
you're sending me into battle
against sorcery.

98
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,125
Would you stop talking to me
in riddles?

99
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:22,045
Power is nothing
if it is given to you.

100
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,381
Go! Reunite the Three Powers.

101
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:26,799
And after they're together?

102
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,926
You can do anything.

103
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,678
You will be the power.

104
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,982
Deathstalker!

105
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:29,153
Your thirst should be only
for the First Power.

106
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,447
Enough riddles.

107
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,116
I'll just take my chances
with my sword.

108
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:34,951
Look behind you!

109
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,869
Salmaron waits there.

110
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,038
The keeper
of the Sword of Justice.

111
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,039
Why didn't you just...

112
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:41,958
...say so?

113
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,183
Salmaron?

114
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,106
I was sent by Toralva.

115
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,942
She gave you something
to safeguard for me.

116
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,281
I live in this damp cave,
trapped,

117
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,825
eating mice, moss, bugs.

118
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,369
And you come here
looking for gifts?

119
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,641
Move it, move it, rats!
Cockroaches got 'em.

120
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,608
Stalker!

121
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:31,901
Stalker!

122
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,444
Catch!

123
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:42,370
The Third Power.

124
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,669
Oh, what now?

125
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,842
-Uh-uh-uh!

126
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,184
You don't have anything to eat,
do you?

127
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:08,688
No, I didn't think so.

128
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,566
It-- It cut through stone!

129
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,234
You must take me with you.

130
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,362
I don't think so.

131
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,365
I'm a victim of Munkar's curse.

132
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,201
I was once a man like you.

133
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,412
A warrior. Brave.

134
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,830
Dashing.

135
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,375
Every spell carries with it
a way out...

136
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,254
...that is no way out.

137
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,715
Your riddles remind me
of Toralva.

138
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,968
I can only be led to freedom
by a boy

139
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,470
who is not a boy.

140
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:46,851
With the power in this sword,
you can set me free.

141
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,722
You know, I'm not accustomed
to the Iight.

142
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,308
Been in this cave for 30 years.

143
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,310
Oh, it's bright-

144
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,070
Take my hand-
I can't see anything.

145
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,113
Ah! That's better.

146
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,115
Kid, kid.

147
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:44,367
Where are you?

148
00:20:44,743 --> 00:20:45,826
Wh-- Uh-oh!

149
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,465
Dashing and handsome.

150
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,759
Are in the eye of the behoIder.

151
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:08,224
What will you do with it?

152
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,768
Reunite the Three Powers.

153
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,521
And I will be the power.

154
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,197
Munkar will set
many traps for you.

155
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:25,533
Choose your allies well.

156
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,498
Get down-
Somebody's coming!

157
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,466
I'll be right back.

158
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,010
Hey, come on.
Get here.

159
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,219
Oh, yeah! Come on.

160
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,887
Get him! Get him!

161
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,820
No! No!

162
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,461
Damn!

163
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:19,837
-Yah!

164
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,966
I know who you are!

165
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,426
Your timing's perfect!

166
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,470
Hyah!

167
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,155
Circle him.
He can't fight us all.

168
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,892
I owe you my life.

169
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,687
My name is Oghris.

170
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,605
Stalker.

171
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,859
No. No!

172
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,819
Just running past
on my way to Munkar's castle.

173
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,904
If I'd known your allegiance
was with Munkar,

174
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,072
I'd have let them kilI you.

175
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,991
It's not loyalty
that takes me there

176
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:13,534
...but fighting.

177
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,454
This has the makings
of the greatest tournament ever.

178
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,164
I don't know a warrior
in the land

179
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,498
that's not bound for it.

180
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,791
-The tournament?

181
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,003
Never fought for a prize
like this before.

182
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,088
To be made Munkar's heir.

183
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:27,590
Think of it.

184
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:29,967
That doesn't sound like much
of a prize to me.

185
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:33,512
lnheriting everything
from a sorcerer who never dies.

186
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,434
No one's time
lasts forever.

187
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,189
I'Il ride with you
to this tournament.

188
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,293
Thirty years of frogs and...

189
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,505
toads, tubes,
and... spiders,

190
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,715
and things l don't even know
what they were.

191
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,678
That's a... magnificent sword.

192
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,681
May l see it?

193
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,813
Spirits.

194
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,733
Spirits don't make noise.

195
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,042
Come out and show yourself
like a man.

196
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,419
Whoever you are.

197
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,391
Kill him and you'll die
before his eyes are closed.

198
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,360
Show yourself.

199
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,237
I'll take his hood off for him

200
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,154
...and his head.

201
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:23,581
I had a dream we would meet
two men on the road.

202
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,667
I didn't think it meant anything¤
but now...

203
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,635
Two men, huh?

204
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:38,512
Dreams are not
what they used to be!

205
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,390
I may be a woman.

206
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,476
My sword has cut down
greater men than you.

207
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,562
And I've dealt
with better women,

208
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,397
with a different sword.

209
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,440
Enough!

210
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:52,234
Save your boasting and your sword
for the tournament.

211
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,279
What are you doing here?

212
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:56,655
I'm Kaira.

213
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,408
I'm on my way to Munkar's
tournament as well.

214
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,160
Alone?

215
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:05,789
You ride the rest of the way
with us.

216
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,210
I'll join you
until the contest begins,

217
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,629
then I'll stand by no one.

218
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,797
Then it wouId be my pleasure
to be the one

219
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,882
you stand against.

220
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:16,592
Be wary, my friend.

221
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,887
Of what? A dream?

222
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,466
Where's mine?

223
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:20,549
Deathstalker is camped
outside the city, my Lord.

224
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:25,971
Very good.

225
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:41,904
--Hmm?

226
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,551
Hmm.

227
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,987
-Hmm-

228
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,282
I feel...

229
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,178
Hmm.

230
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,034
MAN: Mmm- Perfect.

231
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,079
You should put a sparkle
in Munkar's eye.

232
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:19,918
Ah... yes.

233
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:28,927
Come on!

234
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,013
To the castle.

235
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,233
-Yes-

236
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,001
More wine!
More wi...

237
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:24,918
Mmm.

238
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,593
Gotcha!

239
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:55,907
Some wine.

240
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,057
Think she likes you.

241
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:12,400
I bid you welcome
to my kingdom.

242
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,292
I have ruled longer
than most of you have Iived.

243
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:32,254
Now l'm old.

244
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,297
My time is near.

245
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,761
But only the strongest
will take my place.

246
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,849
We shall see in the battles
of the next two days

247
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,101
who will claim my kingdom

248
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,186
and whether good...

249
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,065
or evil...

250
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,650
will rule.

251
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,818
Evil!

252
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,280
So I expect.

253
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,491
But the tests begin tomorrow.

254
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,202
Tonight you are my guests.

255
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,205
And aIl that I have
is yours to share.

256
00:36:07,582 --> 00:36:09,332
Food, drink...

257
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,835
...women.

258
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,214
And in honor of this occasion,

259
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:18,717
the first appearance...

260
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,095
of my newest prize.

261
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:02,260
Who will stand for the court
in this most pleasant bout?

262
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,637
Me!

263
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,347
Me!
Let me do it!

264
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,601
Me!

265
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:19,194
Yes.

266
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,906
You are perfect.

267
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,537
-Hey!
-Hey!

268
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:46,554
No!

269
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:48,974
Please.

270
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,100
No!

271
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,018
Please let me...

272
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:57,399
Stop him, please!
Stop him, please!

273
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:04,656
-I'll help you.
-Please, stop him!

274
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,912
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

275
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:38,792
No!

276
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,212
PIease, stop!

277
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,840
Please!

278
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,028
Were you planning to take her
with you?

279
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,740
For the night, anyway.

280
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:55,034
She is mine, you know?

281
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,959
But I think she fancies you.

282
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,046
l'lI have her sent
to your chamber, when the...

283
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,923
...excitement is over.

284
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,067
Oh!

285
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,292
Hello again.

286
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,084
Thank you.

287
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:03,454
Not again.

288
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:31,399
My Lord, Deathstalker is alone
in his room.

289
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,736
Ah, little Howard.

290
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,822
Here, kitty, kitty--

291
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:39,407
Oh.

292
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:44,078
Deathstalker will not live
to compete in the tournament.

293
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,204
Good.

294
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,874
I would hate to see him win
and become your heir.

295
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,835
You cretin.

296
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,254
There will be no winner.

297
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:57,091
And when the contest is over,
there will be no warrior alive

298
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:59,177
strong enough to oppose me.

299
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,804
-Ah! You will kill the winner.
-Yes.

300
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,892
And you will kill Deathstalker

301
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,934
...tonight.

302
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,562
I will take ten
of my best men.

303
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:11,105
You will go alone

304
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,024
...with this.

305
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:16,152
Someone he won't suspect
must kill him.

306
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,988
He won't suspect me?

307
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:21,199
He won't suspect...

308
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,992
Princess Codille.

309
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,036
But she would never...

310
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,165
Wait, I know what
you're thinking, don't...

311
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,541
No!

312
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,545
Oh... What?

313
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:39,175
I...

314
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,887
It's... It's gone!

315
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,185
Oh, my Lord. Oh!

316
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,292
Uh-huh.

317
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,094
Oh, my Lord.

318
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,388
This is very uncomfortable.

319
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,015
Then, finish quickly,
my princess.

320
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:39,736
But you must do it
when the sword is not in his hand.

321
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:12,268
Come in.

322
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,032
We have plenty of time.

323
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,702
Until the guards
have gone to sleep.

324
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:49,931
It's coId.

325
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,892
We'll fix that.

326
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,967
Who are you?

327
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:28,010
I'm Princess Codille.

328
00:47:49,157 --> 00:47:50,116
No!

329
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,386
Yes!

330
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:19,687
Who...?

331
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:21,647
What the hell are you?

332
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,698
Get out of here.

333
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,119
Go on!

334
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:02,647
Shh.

335
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,193
What...?

336
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:13,407
Let's get you something to wear
and get you out of here.

337
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:26,379
What's wrong with you?

338
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,478
Careful. lf you're hurt...

339
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,855
you won't be as much fun later.

340
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,552
Stalker!

341
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:10,024
Let the tournament begin.

342
00:56:05,236 --> 00:56:06,195
Oghris!

343
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,036
-What are you about?

344
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,734
I've been waiting
30 years for this.

345
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:43,208
I trust you're comfortable.

346
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,752
I am not!

347
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,797
And this is no way
to treat the man

348
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:50,090
who brought you Deathstalker.

349
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,148
You could have ordered them
to be a little more gentile.

350
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,577
I want him dead.

351
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,412
Well, I can do it.

352
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:21,955
Not so easily.

353
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,875
With that sword in his hand,
he can't be harmed.

354
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,877
Then, I'll get it away from him.

355
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,212
No.

356
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,924
After all, my Lord...

357
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:34,635
I am his friend.

358
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:39,723
Do it, then.

359
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:57,658
Munkar plans to kill you tonight.

360
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,412
Forget the tournament.

361
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:04,039
Leave.

362
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,698
Good-bye, my friend.

363
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,721
When the sun sets tonight,

364
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:10,642
one man will stand
the greatest warrior of all.

365
01:04:28,364 --> 01:04:30,949
Now watch the man
you thought might help you.

366
01:05:46,692 --> 01:05:48,109
The Chalice,

367
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,527
the Amulet,

368
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,112
the power.

369
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,115
You can be the power.

370
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,211
All the power comes from me.

371
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,759
