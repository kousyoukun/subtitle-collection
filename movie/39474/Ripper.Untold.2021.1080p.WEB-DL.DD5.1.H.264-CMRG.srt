2
00:02:39,866 --> 00:02:42,203
Anyone gets curious,
move them along.

3
00:02:43,236 --> 00:02:45,173
We don't want her
drawing a crowd.

4
00:02:49,877 --> 00:02:51,112
Inspector Rees?

5
00:02:51,145 --> 00:02:52,413
Yes?

6
00:02:52,445 --> 00:02:53,713
Sebastian Stubb, of
the London Morning Times.

7
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:55,183
Ah, yes, of course.

8
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,617
Anything you can
share with our readers

9
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,818
about the incident?

10
00:02:57,850 --> 00:03:01,788
I doubt your readers would
be very interested, Mr.Stubb.

11
00:03:01,822 --> 00:03:03,390
Oh well, with all
due respect sir,

12
00:03:03,424 --> 00:03:05,126
I think I'll be
the judge of that.

13
00:03:06,659 --> 00:03:07,627
Lone woman.

14
00:03:07,661 --> 00:03:08,462
Knife wound.

15
00:03:09,864 --> 00:03:12,633
Probably a robbery gone
awry some time in the night.

16
00:03:12,665 --> 00:03:13,667
Dear, oh dear,
oh dear Inspector,

17
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,471
you'll never make a
headline writer will you?

18
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,840
What about "mysterious assailant

19
00:03:18,872 --> 00:03:24,078
slashes wench-woman's throat
in bloody midnight attack".

20
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:26,613
That's conjecture.

21
00:03:26,646 --> 00:03:29,382
Time of death is yet
to be established.

22
00:03:29,415 --> 00:03:31,118
All right.

23
00:03:31,151 --> 00:03:34,654
What about "bloody
night time attack" then?

24
00:03:34,687 --> 00:03:36,190
It's reasonable enough.

25
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,159
Now I really must be going.

26
00:03:39,926 --> 00:03:41,895
Oh, can I quote you Inspector?

27
00:03:41,929 --> 00:03:43,631
If you must.

28
00:03:51,538 --> 00:03:53,340
Who told you her
throat was slashed?

29
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,679
Well, it always
pays to be early

30
00:03:58,711 --> 00:04:00,247
on the scene, Inspector.

31
00:04:48,995 --> 00:04:50,830
Morning, Mr Locque.

32
00:04:50,863 --> 00:04:52,832
Inspector Rees sends
his regards, sir.

33
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:53,700
What else?

34
00:04:54,668 --> 00:04:55,869
Oh, it's a young woman.

35
00:04:55,903 --> 00:04:58,840
Found down the dark end of a
dark alley in the early hours.

36
00:05:00,274 --> 00:05:01,942
No prizes for guessing what
she was up to down there.

37
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:04,579
Well, we'll find
out shortly, won't we?

38
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,449
There's always a
trace left behind.

39
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:09,450
Well, that depends,

40
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:12,687
on whether she swallowed
or spat, doesn't it?

41
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:16,257
There is always a trace, Dodd.

42
00:05:17,257 --> 00:05:18,692
You would do well
to remember that.

43
00:05:20,326 --> 00:05:22,629
What are they saying
is the cause of death?

44
00:05:22,663 --> 00:05:24,331
Cut throat, sir.

45
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:25,199
Have a look.

46
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:39,346
Now, he was saying, it looked
like some fellow had got

47
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:41,281
what he wanted but
didn't wanna pay.

48
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:44,618
He probably had a
penknife in his pocket,

49
00:05:44,651 --> 00:05:47,487
there was a scuffle, and
he, er, let her have it.

50
00:05:50,057 --> 00:05:50,891
What?

51
00:05:52,492 --> 00:05:53,627
The penknife.

52
00:05:53,661 --> 00:05:54,461
In the throat, like.

53
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:58,665
It's a very sharp
penknife if it was.

54
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:00,401
Yeah well, they
are, aren't they?

55
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:01,302
Not usually.

56
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:04,538
Not this sharp.

57
00:06:06,673 --> 00:06:08,308
If a man carries a penknife

58
00:06:09,076 --> 00:06:13,347
he uses it for all sorts
of tasks, sawing rope,

59
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:15,682
digging stones from
horses' hooves, anything.

60
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:19,787
The blade ends up
damaged and blunt,

61
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:23,024
with the result being that
penknife cuts are usually jagged,

62
00:06:24,557 --> 00:06:26,760
with lots of damage to
the surrounding skin.

63
00:06:28,362 --> 00:06:30,898
This one is very clean, it's
made with a good quality blade.

64
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,768
A knife's a knife.

65
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,435
I'm trying to teach
you something here, Dodd.

66
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:40,040
It would be good if you
could show some ambition

67
00:06:40,074 --> 00:06:41,609
to better yourself.

68
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,310
You don't wanna be pushing
cadavers round in here

69
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:44,444
all your life.

70
00:06:44,478 --> 00:06:46,079
No, sir.

71
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:48,048
But I don't wanna be
slicing them up, neither.

72
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:49,317
Wait!

73
00:06:53,786 --> 00:06:55,923
Death by cut
throat, did you say?

74
00:06:55,956 --> 00:06:57,325
That's what he said, sir.

75
00:06:58,091 --> 00:06:59,326
Then what is that?

76
00:07:05,098 --> 00:07:06,466
Jesus Christ!

77
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,838
Well I shall
tell you one thing,

78
00:07:14,841 --> 00:07:19,413
this was no scuffle over a coin.

79
00:07:34,795 --> 00:07:38,766
It's a bit early,
what are you after?

80
00:07:38,798 --> 00:07:40,668
A quick word with
the lady of the house,

81
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:41,635
if you'd be so kind.

82
00:07:41,668 --> 00:07:43,370
Miss Levine?

83
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:44,105
If you'd be so kind.

84
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:45,605
Well, I'll ask her-

85
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:48,408
- Tell her it's Ins,

86
00:07:48,442 --> 00:07:50,478
Tell her it's Edmund Rees.

87
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,460
Some tea, Inspector?

88
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:08,395
That would be very nice.

89
00:08:17,838 --> 00:08:19,039
It's been a long time

90
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:21,908
since you've darkened
my doorstep, Edmund.

91
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:24,145
You have a knack of
making every phrase

92
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:26,079
sound like a
euphemism, Miss Levine.

93
00:08:26,112 --> 00:08:28,449
What, "darkened my doorstep"?

94
00:08:29,516 --> 00:08:30,684
Never heard it called that.

95
00:08:30,716 --> 00:08:33,187
I've heard it called a lot of
things but that's a new one.

96
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,523
Can you guess what
brought me here today?

97
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:38,926
Yes, I can guess.

98
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,495
So you know what
I'm going to ask?

99
00:08:43,563 --> 00:08:45,665
That girl they
found in the night.

100
00:08:45,698 --> 00:08:47,534
Not far from here wasn't it?

101
00:08:47,567 --> 00:08:48,502
Two streets down.

102
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,038
It's getting more dangerous
by the hour out there.

103
00:08:52,072 --> 00:08:54,073
Can't you do something about it?

104
00:08:54,106 --> 00:08:54,975
Do you know who she was?

105
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,143
I do.

106
00:08:56,176 --> 00:08:58,512
One of the girls from here
was the one that found her.

107
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:00,814
Came running back and
told me all about it.

108
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:02,416
I'd like to speak to her.

109
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:04,751
I don't think she'd
like to speak to you.

110
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,519
You wouldn't have got
past the door if Sally

111
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:07,455
had known who you were.

112
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,123
Did she recognize the victim?

113
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:10,524
Yes.

114
00:09:10,557 --> 00:09:14,495
Polly Neilson was
her name, I knew her.

115
00:09:14,528 --> 00:09:16,464
Had she ever
worked here before?

116
00:09:16,496 --> 00:09:19,165
No, but not for
want of trying.

117
00:09:19,198 --> 00:09:21,568
They all come here
onetime or another.

118
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:24,204
I mean, wouldn't you
rather ply your trade

119
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:27,108
against a soft pillow
than a cold wall?

120
00:09:28,642 --> 00:09:30,144
But I couldn't help her.

121
00:09:30,177 --> 00:09:31,479
No experience.

122
00:09:31,511 --> 00:09:32,512
So she was knew to it, then?

123
00:09:32,546 --> 00:09:33,948
Oh yes.

124
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:36,716
Fallen on hard
times, as they say.

125
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,486
She'd been a maid for a
gentleman in a big house.

126
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,754
Very proud of that, she was.

127
00:09:41,788 --> 00:09:43,557
Gave me his card as proof.

128
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:47,628
Let's see, I've
got it somewhere.

129
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:54,534
This lady, Polly Neilson, she
was definitely in the trade?

130
00:09:55,568 --> 00:09:56,503
I should say so.

131
00:09:57,571 --> 00:09:59,273
Unless she found some other
way of earning a living

132
00:09:59,306 --> 00:10:01,975
in a dark alleyway in
the middle of the night.

133
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,144
The girl that found her,
she didn't see anything else,

134
00:10:04,177 --> 00:10:06,080
anything suspicious,
somebody running away?

135
00:10:06,113 --> 00:10:07,248
Not that she told me.

136
00:10:08,581 --> 00:10:09,216
Very well.

137
00:10:10,616 --> 00:10:11,951
At least we've got a
name, Polly Neilson.

138
00:10:11,985 --> 00:10:13,086
Not staying for another tea?

139
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,288
Er, no thank you,

140
00:10:14,321 --> 00:10:16,757
it's better if I wasn't seen
spending too much time here.

141
00:10:16,789 --> 00:10:18,592
Oh, shame.

142
00:10:20,326 --> 00:10:22,562
There's nothing better
than something wet

143
00:10:22,596 --> 00:10:24,831
and warm on a cold
day, Inspector.

144
00:10:27,301 --> 00:10:29,637
As my dear late
husband used to say.

145
00:10:30,937 --> 00:10:32,706
I'll see myself out.

146
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:19,687
I asked upstairs but the
Inspector's out on his rounds.

147
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,555
Never mind.

148
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:23,957
I'll have more to tell him
by the time he gets back.

149
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:52,852
Any news?

150
00:11:52,885 --> 00:11:53,687
News?

151
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,822
On the murder.

152
00:11:54,855 --> 00:11:56,356
Everyone's asking about it.

153
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:05,064
Oh, before you sit down,
sir, that lad from the morgue

154
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:06,366
came looking for you earlier.

155
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,403
Said the Medical
Examiner wanted a word.

156
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:26,052
Locque?

157
00:12:26,086 --> 00:12:27,654
Ah, Inspector.

158
00:12:27,687 --> 00:12:28,956
You got my message, I take it?

159
00:12:28,989 --> 00:12:31,992
Er, shame about
the circumstances.

160
00:12:32,024 --> 00:12:33,259
Indeed.

161
00:12:33,293 --> 00:12:34,695
Though I can't think of
any other circumstances

162
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:36,096
in which we are
ever likely to meet.

163
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:37,898
A drink some time, perhaps?

164
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,734
Er, no, no thank you, I don't.

165
00:12:41,301 --> 00:12:42,703
So what's this
about the young lady?

166
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:43,870
Dodd said something
to my colleague

167
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,938
about an abominable injury?

168
00:12:45,971 --> 00:12:46,774
Abdominal.

169
00:12:46,807 --> 00:12:48,075
An abdominal injury.

170
00:12:48,107 --> 00:12:49,208
What sort of thing
are we talking about?

171
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:51,679
Well, it might be better
if you saw it for yourself.

172
00:12:55,782 --> 00:12:57,317
Christ in heaven!

173
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,689
Dodd had it about right.

174
00:13:06,259 --> 00:13:07,961
What would motivate a man
to do something like this?

175
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:10,764
It's not for me to delve
into motives, Inspector.

176
00:13:11,398 --> 00:13:13,933
That's your department.

177
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,336
I've never seen
anything like this.

178
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:17,672
Nor have I.

179
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,720
Elizabeth?

180
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:11,125
Straight to the
book cabinet, Thomas?

181
00:14:12,793 --> 00:14:15,129
I sometimes wonder if you
care more for those books

182
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:16,363
than you do for me?

183
00:14:16,395 --> 00:14:20,300
Not at all, I, I just
wanted to return this.

184
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:24,104
I know you're curious
about my work, Elizabeth,

185
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:26,239
but it really is no
subject for a lady.

186
00:14:26,273 --> 00:14:28,041
I was bored.

187
00:14:28,073 --> 00:14:30,510
Reading helps to pass the time.

188
00:14:30,543 --> 00:14:32,946
Did you know that the
human tongue is made up

189
00:14:32,979 --> 00:14:36,517
of eight separate
interwoven muscles?

190
00:14:36,549 --> 00:14:38,017
I'm sure there must
be more edifying things

191
00:14:38,051 --> 00:14:39,286
to read about the house.

192
00:14:40,821 --> 00:14:41,822
Or things to do?

193
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:46,593
Say what you will, Elizabeth.

194
00:14:48,427 --> 00:14:50,898
I'd certainly miss Emily if
we had to do without her.

195
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,399
I'm sure you would.

196
00:14:52,432 --> 00:14:53,834
I meant her cooking.

197
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:57,403
That was an
excellent roast beef.

198
00:14:57,437 --> 00:15:00,072
It was just missing a
glass of good red wine

199
00:15:00,105 --> 00:15:01,040
to go along with it.

200
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:05,846
I'll not enter into that
debate with you again, Thomas.

201
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:07,080
No, I only meant-

202
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,583
- I'll not have any drink in
this house until you've proved

203
00:15:09,615 --> 00:15:12,819
you're capable of controlling
your urge to overindulge.

204
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:15,221
That was all a long
time ago, Elizabeth.

205
00:15:15,254 --> 00:15:17,825
I told you, I'm
not discussing it.

206
00:15:17,857 --> 00:15:20,560
How can I prove I
can control my urges

207
00:15:20,594 --> 00:15:23,497
when there's nothing in the
house to bloody-well drink!

208
00:15:35,075 --> 00:15:35,910
Well.

209
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,551
I think you've just
proved the very opposite.

210
00:17:53,145 --> 00:17:54,714
Ah, Stubb.

211
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:57,284
Just been reading your story
in this morning's paper.

212
00:17:58,484 --> 00:18:01,120
I do not appreciate my
name being mentioned.

213
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:03,557
Well, you said I could
quote you, Inspector.

214
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,462
Well?

215
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:10,998
What can I do for you this time?

216
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:16,003
It's more what I can
do for you, Inspector.

217
00:18:18,337 --> 00:18:19,173
What's this?

218
00:18:20,272 --> 00:18:21,140
A confession.

219
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:25,645
What are you confessing to?

220
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:26,647
It's not from me!

221
00:18:28,114 --> 00:18:30,985
It's from the
killer of that girl.

222
00:18:31,683 --> 00:18:33,119
Where did you get it from?

223
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,391
It was sent to me
personally, via the newspaper.

224
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:40,527
Probably some disturbed
person's idea of a joke.

225
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,495
Seems authentic
to me, Inspector.

226
00:18:42,528 --> 00:18:43,364
Let me see it.

227
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,601
I thought we could come to
some kind of an arrangement.

228
00:18:47,634 --> 00:18:48,634
What do you mean?

229
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,740
Well, I've got the
killer's side of the story.

230
00:18:54,606 --> 00:18:55,675
I just need the copper's.

231
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,711
I'd make it a big
two-parter, you know,

232
00:18:58,744 --> 00:19:00,579
front page with a
big illustration

233
00:19:00,613 --> 00:19:01,815
of the killer
standing over the body

234
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:02,615
with a knife in his hand and-

235
00:19:02,648 --> 00:19:05,718
- Just give me
the bloody letter.

236
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,064
Red ink, seems like a gimmick.

237
00:19:17,096 --> 00:19:18,298
Well, it wouldn't
be the first time

238
00:19:18,330 --> 00:19:19,799
that a killer's been
attracted to the idea

239
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,335
of gaining notoriety
now Inspector, would it?

240
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:25,105
And that would explain
why he send it directly

241
00:19:25,137 --> 00:19:27,441
to a newspaper, as
opposed to yourself.

242
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:33,747
Oh, and, er, he's given
himself a little trade name.

243
00:19:34,847 --> 00:19:36,115
"Jack the Ripper".

244
00:19:37,517 --> 00:19:40,086
It's good, isn't it?

245
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:42,588
Better than anything I
could've ever come up with.

246
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:47,427
Oh, and, er, he goes over
everything he did to that girl,

247
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,163
in great detail.

248
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:58,839
This is obscene.

249
00:19:58,872 --> 00:20:02,076
If you publish any of
this, you're a damn fool.

250
00:20:18,157 --> 00:20:20,259
Report on Polly
Neilson, is it ready?

251
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:21,894
Yes, I finished
with her yesterday,

252
00:20:21,928 --> 00:20:24,231
the report's been sat
on my desk all night.

253
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:26,365
Just give me the highlights,
I need to check on something.

254
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,667
Well, the cause of death,
as you correctly surmised,

255
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:32,139
was two deep cuts to the
throat, one of which completely

256
00:20:32,172 --> 00:20:35,909
severed all of the tissue
down to the vertebrae.

257
00:20:35,942 --> 00:20:38,144
That's the spinal
column, Inspector.

258
00:20:38,178 --> 00:20:39,579
What about the other injuries?

259
00:20:39,612 --> 00:20:41,715
Well, there are
several small stab wounds

260
00:20:41,748 --> 00:20:43,250
and two very deep ones,

261
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:46,152
one particularly so leading
to a breach of the bowel.

262
00:20:46,185 --> 00:20:47,787
And a very large
concentration of damage

263
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:49,655
to the interior of the abdomen.

264
00:20:51,457 --> 00:20:54,928
When you say the, er, abdomen.

265
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:55,929
Yes?

266
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:57,530
A gentleman has an abdomen,

267
00:20:57,564 --> 00:21:00,432
but a gentleman
doesn't have a, er-

268
00:21:00,465 --> 00:21:02,334
- The injuries are
specific to that part

269
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:05,237
of a woman's abdomen
which differentiates

270
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:06,472
it to that of a gentleman's.

271
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:12,878
I made fully detailed
notes, in my report.

272
00:21:12,912 --> 00:21:14,013
No, leave that here.

273
00:21:14,047 --> 00:21:16,516
I want to keep the details
of this between ourselves

274
00:21:16,548 --> 00:21:18,250
at the moment.

275
00:21:18,284 --> 00:21:20,187
This type of crime tends to
attract a lot of attention.

276
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,355
I've already had a reporter
in my office this morning.

277
00:21:22,387 --> 00:21:23,222
I understand.

278
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,227
Funny thing is
he had this letter,

279
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,261
supposedly from the killer.

280
00:21:29,295 --> 00:21:30,864
Yes?

281
00:21:30,896 --> 00:21:33,299
Thought it was a lot of
nonsense, a silly practical joke,

282
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:36,202
but the description of
the injuries was bang on.

283
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:37,938
A lot of people could
have seen the body

284
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:39,306
before you got there.

285
00:21:39,338 --> 00:21:40,906
Even the internal wounds?

286
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,477
Sorry, sir, but it's urgent.

287
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:45,444
What is it?

288
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:47,314
They've found another one.

289
00:21:47,346 --> 00:21:48,615
Another what?

290
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:49,682
A girl, sir.

291
00:21:54,988 --> 00:21:58,325
Keep a close guard on her
'till the carriage gets here.

292
00:21:58,357 --> 00:21:59,592
I don't want anybody
touching the body

293
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:01,461
till we get it to
the medical examiner.

294
00:22:02,662 --> 00:22:04,798
Her name was Mary Anne Keates.

295
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:08,268
You seem very well
informed, Stubb.

296
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,336
I just ask around,
Inspector, that's all.

297
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,338
Thought you might have
read it in a letter.

298
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,975
You never know,
Inspector, you never know.

299
00:22:15,008 --> 00:22:17,711
But, if I do get another one,

300
00:22:19,912 --> 00:22:21,014
you'll be the first to know.

301
00:22:21,047 --> 00:22:22,716
I will?

302
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:27,520
You will, if we can come
to some kind of arrangement.

303
00:22:29,521 --> 00:22:31,991
Otherwise, like everyone else,

304
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:34,594
you can read it on the front
page of the Morning Times.

305
00:22:41,768 --> 00:22:43,336
Have a care, Dodd.

306
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:44,471
What's the matter?

307
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:46,372
She's dead, isn't she?

308
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:49,308
She ain't gonna be
complaining about the service.

309
00:22:49,342 --> 00:22:54,314
I have to accurately
ascertain the cause of death.

310
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,384
If you throw her from the
trolley and break her neck,

311
00:22:58,651 --> 00:23:01,454
how will I know if the damage
was done pre or post-mortem?

312
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:03,856
Yeah, well, the, er,
cause of death's no mystery

313
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,725
with this one.

314
00:23:16,868 --> 00:23:18,437
It's a cut throat once again.

315
00:23:21,374 --> 00:23:22,907
Yeah.

316
00:23:22,909 --> 00:23:24,076
And the rest.

317
00:23:24,109 --> 00:23:25,611
You've already examined her?

318
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,581
I had a good look, yeah.

319
00:23:28,614 --> 00:23:30,083
When I took her dress off.

320
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,751
So, you're finally taking
an interest in your work?

321
00:23:32,785 --> 00:23:33,920
Only the pretty ones.

322
00:23:35,121 --> 00:23:37,791
So she's the same
as the previous one?

323
00:23:37,824 --> 00:23:38,659
No.

324
00:23:39,726 --> 00:23:40,627
She's worse.

325
00:23:57,042 --> 00:23:58,377
Miss Levine, please, now.

326
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,720
Not that I don't appreciate
your visits, Edmund,

327
00:24:06,752 --> 00:24:10,723
but you could try to be
a bit more circumspect.

328
00:24:10,757 --> 00:24:13,125
Almost knocking the door
down in broad daylight?

329
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:15,662
This is a very serious matter.

330
00:24:36,481 --> 00:24:38,084
It's become apparent
that the murders

331
00:24:38,116 --> 00:24:40,019
have a particular edge to them.

332
00:24:41,721 --> 00:24:46,125
The, er, perpetrator seems to
be taking a certain pleasure

333
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,826
in the act of violence.

334
00:24:47,859 --> 00:24:50,462
And what light are you
expected me to shed on this?

335
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,799
Well it's occurred to
me you might have acquired

336
00:24:52,832 --> 00:24:55,502
a substantial knowledge,
over the years,

337
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,438
of the preferences
of a large number

338
00:24:58,471 --> 00:25:01,375
of the gentlemen in the area.

339
00:25:02,575 --> 00:25:05,412
Do any of your regulars like
to get rough with girls?

340
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:07,413
Hit them, cut them,
that sort of thing?

341
00:25:07,446 --> 00:25:08,647
It happens.

342
00:25:08,681 --> 00:25:09,749
But they don't stay
regulars very long

343
00:25:09,781 --> 00:25:11,518
once I get to hear about it.

344
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,051
To be frank, Inspector,

345
00:25:13,085 --> 00:25:15,188
it's far more common
the other way round.

346
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:16,522
The other way round?

347
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:17,824
Oh yes, there's plenty of them

348
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:20,527
that come here for
a bit of abuse.

349
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,428
Doctors, lawyers, judges.

350
00:25:23,162 --> 00:25:25,432
We've got a special room for it.

351
00:25:25,464 --> 00:25:26,500
Would you like to see it?

352
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:46,152
I'm sorry I can't help
you any further, Edmund.

353
00:25:46,184 --> 00:25:48,086
You mentioned a
gentleman's card

354
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,488
you were gonna give me.

355
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:52,491
Yes, I'm sure
it's here somewhere.

356
00:25:57,563 --> 00:25:59,199
Never mind, I'm
sure it'll show up.

357
00:26:00,532 --> 00:26:02,501
There was one other
thing, Inspector.

358
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:05,004
Some awful man came knocking
on the door this morning

359
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:07,841
claiming to be from the
Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.

360
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,215
Accused me of living
off immoral earnings.

361
00:26:16,249 --> 00:26:18,218
He's not entirely
inaccurate then, is he?

362
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,487
You know this building's
all my dear late husband

363
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:24,190
left me with to eke out a
living in my autumn years.

364
00:26:27,792 --> 00:26:29,695
Remind me, what
did he die of again?

365
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,532
Misbehavior.

366
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,569
There seems to be
a lot of it about.

367
00:26:49,949 --> 00:26:51,551
Inspector Rees?

368
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:53,119
Yes.

369
00:26:53,152 --> 00:26:54,653
What can I do for you?

370
00:26:54,686 --> 00:26:56,155
I suppose you've seen this?

371
00:26:57,323 --> 00:26:58,791
The newspaper?

372
00:26:58,824 --> 00:26:59,826
This!

373
00:26:59,858 --> 00:27:01,627
These appalling murders.

374
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:02,496
Murders?

375
00:27:03,663 --> 00:27:05,198
The newspaper
only mentions one.

376
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,534
I heard from my carriage
driver on the way here

377
00:27:07,567 --> 00:27:09,301
that a second body
had been discovered.

378
00:27:09,335 --> 00:27:11,004
Word travels fast.

379
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:13,539
Yes, a lot faster than you
it would seem, Inspector.

380
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:15,173
Excuse me, sir, may I ask-

381
00:27:15,207 --> 00:27:17,110
- Doctor George Lowry.

382
00:27:17,143 --> 00:27:19,546
Head of the Whitechapel
Vigilance Committee.

383
00:27:21,646 --> 00:27:23,582
It's simply not good
enough, Inspector.

384
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,854
I've been a resident of
Whitechapel for over 60 years,

385
00:27:27,886 --> 00:27:29,655
man and boy.

386
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,557
Ran a highly regarded
medical practice

387
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:33,092
until my retirement last year.

388
00:27:34,594 --> 00:27:38,163
This used to be a decent,
God-fearing community.

389
00:27:39,832 --> 00:27:41,167
Now look at it.

390
00:27:42,734 --> 00:27:44,303
Once can scarce set foot
outside one's own front

391
00:27:44,336 --> 00:27:47,240
door without being accosted
by some filthy rag-seller.

392
00:27:48,607 --> 00:27:53,078
Or being propositioned by,
well, by the likes of this girl.

393
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:57,250
And as if that wasn't enough,

394
00:27:58,651 --> 00:28:02,288
now we have some foreign
butcher committing acts

395
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,255
of such atrocity-

396
00:28:03,288 --> 00:28:04,691
- Foreign butcher?

397
00:28:04,723 --> 00:28:05,925
Well, wouldn't you
say so, Inspector?

398
00:28:07,027 --> 00:28:11,364
I can't imagine a true
Englishman sinking to the level

399
00:28:11,396 --> 00:28:13,732
of such depravity.

400
00:28:14,933 --> 00:28:18,104
Do your job properly, Inspector,
and I am sure you will find

401
00:28:18,136 --> 00:28:23,143
the dark hand of some
Persian or an Oriental

402
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:25,345
is behind all this.

403
00:28:25,377 --> 00:28:28,347
Be that as it may, there has
indeed been a second murder.

404
00:28:29,714 --> 00:28:31,951
So my next step is to
establish what connects

405
00:28:31,983 --> 00:28:33,619
the two events-

406
00:28:33,653 --> 00:28:36,655
- Spare me the procedural
recitation, Inspector.

407
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:38,858
The Whitechapel Vigilance
Committee are well-versed

408
00:28:38,891 --> 00:28:41,728
in matters of law and order.

409
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,064
Some of our members
are retired judges.

410
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:48,835
Our patron is none other than
your very own Chief Inspector.

411
00:28:52,137 --> 00:28:53,005
Answer me this,

412
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,677
do you have any suspect
in mind for these crimes?

413
00:28:58,743 --> 00:28:59,811
No.

414
00:28:59,845 --> 00:29:01,381
Then what the devil are
you doing sat behind a desk

415
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:02,816
talking to me?

416
00:29:03,816 --> 00:29:04,884
Get out there, man.

417
00:29:06,152 --> 00:29:09,689
Do your job, knock
on some doors.

418
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:11,691
I can list you a dozen streets

419
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:14,394
where you will
find meat vendors,

420
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:18,063
and animal slaughterers,
and tanners.

421
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:22,334
And not one of
them an Englishman.

422
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:25,904
Thank you, Dr Lowry,
that won't be necessary.

423
00:29:25,938 --> 00:29:28,708
And if you do nothing else,

424
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,442
can you not, at the very least,

425
00:29:30,476 --> 00:29:33,647
put an end to these
frightful newspaper stories?

426
00:29:34,446 --> 00:29:35,814
It's bad enough.

427
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:39,184
We have a murderer
on our streets

428
00:29:39,218 --> 00:29:42,255
without the gruesome
details being spread far

429
00:29:42,288 --> 00:29:44,790
and wide for the general
populace to gossip about.

430
00:29:46,959 --> 00:29:48,928
I will not have the good name

431
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:52,832
of Whitechapel
besmirched any further.

432
00:29:55,468 --> 00:29:57,003
Good day to you, inspector.

433
00:30:10,516 --> 00:30:11,750
Elizabeth?

434
00:30:11,784 --> 00:30:13,787
In here.

435
00:30:16,288 --> 00:30:17,190
What's all this?

436
00:30:17,222 --> 00:30:19,759
I've made your dinner, Thomas.

437
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:21,293
You have?

438
00:30:21,326 --> 00:30:22,795
What about Emily?

439
00:30:22,827 --> 00:30:24,730
Is it such a surprise?

440
00:30:24,763 --> 00:30:27,132
I'm perfectly capable, Thomas.

441
00:30:27,165 --> 00:30:29,068
Remember when we
were first married?

442
00:30:30,102 --> 00:30:31,871
There were no housemaids then.

443
00:30:32,505 --> 00:30:33,840
I remember it well.

444
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:37,844
Wine, that is a surprise.

445
00:30:39,044 --> 00:30:41,381
I felt badly about
what I said yesterday.

446
00:30:43,281 --> 00:30:45,183
Don't let your meal get cold.

447
00:30:45,217 --> 00:30:46,152
Are you not joining me?

448
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:47,819
I had something earlier.

449
00:30:47,853 --> 00:30:49,722
This is all about you.

450
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,792
I made your favorite.

451
00:30:53,858 --> 00:30:54,793
Steak and kidney.

452
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:09,075
Mmm, it's excellent, Elizabeth.

453
00:31:18,183 --> 00:31:22,855
You know, Thomas, wine
isn't the only thing

454
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:24,757
we've gone without
these past years.

455
00:31:27,992 --> 00:31:32,365
Perhaps tonight could be
something of a, a new beginning?

456
00:31:43,608 --> 00:31:47,145
There, I knew we
could do without.

457
00:31:47,179 --> 00:31:48,881
Without what?

458
00:31:48,913 --> 00:31:50,048
Without Emily.

459
00:31:50,082 --> 00:31:51,818
Well, for a night, yes.

460
00:31:51,851 --> 00:31:52,985
Did you give her the day off?

461
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:54,788
I gave her every day off.

462
00:31:56,488 --> 00:32:00,092
I told her to seek a new
position with immediate effect.

463
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:01,193
You did what?

464
00:32:02,493 --> 00:32:04,230
Don't make a fuss, Thomas.

465
00:32:04,262 --> 00:32:05,097
Make a fuss?

466
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:08,533
I'm the head of this
household, Elizabeth.

467
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,935
You should have consulted me

468
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:10,536
before making a
decision like that.

469
00:32:10,568 --> 00:32:12,471
Head of the household?

470
00:32:12,503 --> 00:32:14,940
But I'm the one who's here
all the time, you're not.

471
00:32:14,973 --> 00:32:16,907
No, Elizabeth.

472
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:17,844
I'll not have this.

473
00:32:19,545 --> 00:32:21,913
You must find her
and ask her back.

474
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,549
With an apology if necessary.

475
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:28,955
You'd have your own
wife go begging to a maid?

476
00:32:30,355 --> 00:32:32,325
Well I'm sure that won't
be necessary, I just-

477
00:32:32,357 --> 00:32:35,828
- I wonder which one of us
is more important to you?

478
00:32:36,528 --> 00:32:37,864
What's that supposed to mean?

479
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:40,232
You've a wandering
eye, Thomas.

480
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:42,902
Don't think I haven't noticed.

481
00:32:42,934 --> 00:32:44,903
I've never laid
a hand on Emily!

482
00:32:47,906 --> 00:32:49,008
I'd know if you had.

483
00:32:50,675 --> 00:32:51,577
Believe me.

484
00:32:56,648 --> 00:32:57,916
I know you.

485
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:01,220
Perhaps better than you think,

486
00:33:06,525 --> 00:33:08,326
remember that.

487
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:02,648
Have you seen this?

488
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:06,285
Stubb's published another
letter from the Ripper.

489
00:34:06,317 --> 00:34:08,353
Details of the case
I didn't even know.

490
00:34:09,755 --> 00:34:11,724
There's got to be something
we can charge him with.

491
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,358
Aiding and abetting, sir?

492
00:34:13,391 --> 00:34:14,559
That's going a bit far.

493
00:34:14,592 --> 00:34:16,194
As far as we know at the moment.

494
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:18,965
Our friend Dr Lowry's
not gonna be happy

495
00:34:18,998 --> 00:34:21,166
when he sees this, and
he claims to have the ear

496
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,500
of the Chief Inspector.

497
00:34:22,534 --> 00:34:23,936
I wouldn't worry, sir.

498
00:34:25,103 --> 00:34:27,372
Chief Inspector's out
of town, family wedding.

499
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,360
Come on, Locque,
where are you?

500
00:35:05,244 --> 00:35:07,012
Inspector?

501
00:35:07,045 --> 00:35:08,547
I was just, er-

502
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:10,715
- We don't leave cadavers
out over night, Inspector.

503
00:35:10,748 --> 00:35:12,617
But you do leave
the door unlocked?

504
00:35:15,054 --> 00:35:15,655
Not usually.

505
00:35:16,822 --> 00:35:19,191
I was running a bit
late this morning.

506
00:35:19,224 --> 00:35:22,061
Perhaps it was Dodd,
he has the other key.

507
00:35:22,094 --> 00:35:23,596
What can I do for
you, Inspector?

508
00:35:23,628 --> 00:35:25,331
Report on the
second Ripper victim,

509
00:35:25,364 --> 00:35:26,164
is it ready yet?

510
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:27,699
Yes, it's on my desk.

511
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:28,735
I couldn't see it.

512
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:36,174
Never mind, just give
me the highlights.

513
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,377
Are the injuries
the same as before?

514
00:35:38,409 --> 00:35:39,577
More or less.

515
00:35:39,610 --> 00:35:40,578
Would you say it's
the same killer?

516
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:41,813
Most definitely.

517
00:35:41,847 --> 00:35:45,151
The chances of there being two
different murderers operating

518
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:48,653
in such a manner at the same
time would be infinitesimal.

519
00:35:48,686 --> 00:35:50,722
Was there anything
missing from the victim?

520
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,291
A kidney.

521
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:54,559
Completely removed.

522
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:59,130
But you knew that, didn't you?

523
00:35:59,164 --> 00:36:00,066
How?

524
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,167
This morning's paper.

525
00:36:01,833 --> 00:36:03,168
That's impossible.

526
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,671
Published another
letter from the Ripper.

527
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:08,074
What was done to the
girl's body in detail.

528
00:36:10,509 --> 00:36:11,577
Well that settles it.

529
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:17,682
The letters are real, and
so is Jack the Ripper.

530
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,324
Sorry sir, I thought
you'd wanna know right away.

531
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,092
They've found another body.

532
00:36:27,126 --> 00:36:28,327
Looks like our man again.

533
00:36:42,507 --> 00:36:45,744
Be nice to go just one day
without finding another body.

534
00:36:50,916 --> 00:36:52,218
It's Stubb!

535
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:55,688
I'd like a word with him.

536
00:37:23,815 --> 00:37:26,251
I imagine you know which
case you've been invited in

537
00:37:26,284 --> 00:37:27,385
to share you knowledge of?

538
00:37:27,418 --> 00:37:28,853
Invited to share my knowledge?

539
00:37:28,887 --> 00:37:30,856
Yeah well, that's a fine way
to put it, Inspector, isn't it?

540
00:37:30,889 --> 00:37:32,691
I'm learning from you, Stubb.

541
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:33,826
I'm an innocent
man, Inspector.

542
00:37:33,858 --> 00:37:35,260
Why did you run?

543
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:37,228
I've not even been
charged with anything.

544
00:37:37,262 --> 00:37:39,198
Allow me to remedy
that situation.

545
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:42,668
Unless you start talking you'll
be charged with the murders

546
00:37:42,701 --> 00:37:46,472
of Polly Neilson, Annie
Chaplin and quite possibly

547
00:37:46,505 --> 00:37:47,907
the young girl that
was found this morning.

548
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,175
Murders?

549
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:53,612
I, I thought you were
gonna charge me with-

550
00:37:53,644 --> 00:37:54,480
- With what?

551
00:37:58,282 --> 00:37:59,717
Nothing.

552
00:37:59,751 --> 00:38:01,921
Nothing, I, er, I misspoke.

553
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,624
Why don't you try again?

554
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,161
I don't know nothing
about those murders.

555
00:38:10,195 --> 00:38:15,233
On the contrary, Mr Stubb,
you seem to know an awful lot.

556
00:38:15,266 --> 00:38:16,601
Rather too much, as it happens.

557
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:20,239
Intimate, detailed
knowledge of the wounds

558
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,442
to each victim's body,
that you didn't get from me

559
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,510
or anybody else in
this department.

560
00:38:25,543 --> 00:38:27,679
Well those details were
in the letters, Inspector.

561
00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:31,517
Oh yes, the famous
Ripper Letters.

562
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,986
In blood red ink, no less.

563
00:38:34,018 --> 00:38:36,421
You said yourself that they
were authentic, Inspector.

564
00:38:36,454 --> 00:38:38,990
I said the information
in them was authentic,

565
00:38:39,023 --> 00:38:40,358
not the writer.

566
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:43,761
And it seems to me
that you, Stubb,

567
00:38:43,795 --> 00:38:45,731
personally have done rather well

568
00:38:45,764 --> 00:38:49,202
out of this whole,
nasty business.

569
00:38:52,471 --> 00:38:53,072
Search his bag.

570
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:56,241
You've no right to do that.

571
00:38:56,275 --> 00:38:57,677
Something to hide in there?

572
00:38:58,643 --> 00:39:00,346
The murder weapon perhaps?

573
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,681
Of course not.

574
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:07,286
Looks like a
packet of notepaper.

575
00:39:09,987 --> 00:39:11,088
And an ink pen.

576
00:39:11,123 --> 00:39:13,492
Of course I've got an ink
pen, I'm a writer aren't I?

577
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,833
Simpson's Best
Quality Writing Ink.

578
00:39:23,335 --> 00:39:24,336
Scarlet Red.

579
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,545
I wonder, Mr Stubb, if we took
a sample of your handwriting

580
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:36,716
and compared it to one
of these Ripper letters,

581
00:39:37,882 --> 00:39:39,417
what conclusion
we might come to?

582
00:39:47,092 --> 00:39:48,360
You got a light?

583
00:39:49,927 --> 00:39:50,762
No.

584
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:09,414
All right.

585
00:40:09,447 --> 00:40:10,382
I did the letters.

586
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:13,952
It was just a bit of
showmanship, you know?

587
00:40:13,985 --> 00:40:17,021
And er, well, I didn't think
it would cause any harm.

588
00:40:17,054 --> 00:40:18,089
And the murders?

589
00:40:18,123 --> 00:40:19,692
No.

590
00:40:19,724 --> 00:40:21,360
No, I ain't nothing to
do with those murders.

591
00:40:21,393 --> 00:40:24,396
Then how did you know what
to write in those letters?

592
00:40:24,429 --> 00:40:27,465
Every knife slash, every cut.

593
00:40:27,498 --> 00:40:29,934
Every detail of
those girls' bodies.

594
00:40:44,548 --> 00:40:47,820
Well sir, this one's
in a right state.

595
00:40:49,387 --> 00:40:50,588
Why does he do it, do you think?

596
00:40:50,621 --> 00:40:52,657
It's not for us to divine why.

597
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:55,427
Yeah but, you must wonder.

598
00:40:56,862 --> 00:40:58,797
I mean, everyone's
talking about it,

599
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,898
it's all Ripper this
and Ripper that.

600
00:41:00,931 --> 00:41:02,534
I have to keep my head down.

601
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,904
If anyone knew I'd had my
hands all over his victims...

602
00:41:06,938 --> 00:41:10,376
The second victim, do you
know where my report is?

603
00:41:13,077 --> 00:41:15,380
It'll be on your
desk, won't it?

604
00:41:15,414 --> 00:41:16,749
It isn't.

605
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,517
But I'm sure it was last night.

606
00:41:22,721 --> 00:41:24,590
You probably took it home.

607
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,659
Now why would I do that?

608
00:41:32,496 --> 00:41:34,866
Are you sure you don't
know where it is?

609
00:41:39,603 --> 00:41:41,973
Put yourself in
my position, Stubb.

610
00:41:43,974 --> 00:41:45,911
I'm under a lot of
pressure to nab somebody

611
00:41:45,943 --> 00:41:50,516
for these murders, thanks
to your bloody newspaper.

612
00:41:52,217 --> 00:41:55,421
You're the first to the
scene of every crime,

613
00:41:56,621 --> 00:41:59,157
you've got in-depth
knowledge of the killings,

614
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:02,894
and you, personally
stand to benefit

615
00:42:02,927 --> 00:42:05,963
from each and every murder,

616
00:42:05,996 --> 00:42:08,500
the more shocking and
perverted the better.

617
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:14,539
Give me one damn reason
why I shouldn't throw you

618
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:16,841
in the cells this very minute?

619
00:42:23,648 --> 00:42:25,017
Locque?

620
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,518
I'm in the middle of something!

621
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,152
I know.

622
00:42:27,184 --> 00:42:28,453
That is why I came.

623
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:32,625
Tell him, Dodd.

624
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:37,528
He got 'em from me.

625
00:42:37,561 --> 00:42:38,596
What?

626
00:42:40,998 --> 00:42:43,201
The medical reports
on the bodies.

627
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:45,838
He's been taking
them from my desk,

628
00:42:45,871 --> 00:42:48,773
copying them out and then
returning them the next morning.

629
00:42:49,974 --> 00:42:52,577
And the copies went
to your friend, there,

630
00:42:52,610 --> 00:42:54,078
from the newspaper.

631
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,583
Are you sure of this?

632
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:00,219
This morning he
forgot to put them back.

633
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:03,255
And I imagine you
paid a pretty penny for them?

634
00:43:03,288 --> 00:43:05,090
It's not a crime to
report the true facts

635
00:43:05,123 --> 00:43:06,525
of a case, is it?

636
00:43:06,557 --> 00:43:08,527
Why didn't you just
bloody-well say so?

637
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:11,130
I'm a journalist, Inspector.

638
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,499
I have to protect my sources.

639
00:43:15,733 --> 00:43:17,502
Take 'em away.

640
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:31,851
It's been a long day.

641
00:43:33,117 --> 00:43:35,621
Join me for a drink,
why don't you?

642
00:43:35,653 --> 00:43:36,554
I, um-

643
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:38,257
- Come on, it's not six o'clock.

644
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:40,259
You can spare me ten minutes.

645
00:43:40,291 --> 00:43:43,228
I cant stay too long, my wife-

646
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,663
- Keeps you on your
toes, does she?

647
00:43:44,695 --> 00:43:46,632
You could say that.

648
00:43:46,664 --> 00:43:47,699
Still, cheers.

649
00:43:49,867 --> 00:43:52,203
It's worth it, I imagine.

650
00:43:52,237 --> 00:43:53,271
You're not married?

651
00:43:53,304 --> 00:43:56,641
No, never found the time.

652
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:59,144
Must have spent too much
of it behind that desk.

653
00:44:01,646 --> 00:44:02,714
Thomas.

654
00:44:02,746 --> 00:44:04,082
It is Thomas, isn't it?

655
00:44:05,784 --> 00:44:07,586
Yes, my work does come first.

656
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:09,755
I imagine you're
under a lot of pressure.

657
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:11,957
It's not the
external pressure,

658
00:44:11,989 --> 00:44:13,558
it's what's in here, Thomas.

659
00:44:16,293 --> 00:44:19,297
I take it personally,
whatever happens on my patch,

660
00:44:19,331 --> 00:44:23,936
and whoever the victim is, be
it, lord, lady or gentleman.

661
00:44:24,902 --> 00:44:25,737
Or whore.

662
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,208
They all deserve justice.

663
00:44:32,043 --> 00:44:34,646
Now, about the Ripper-

664
00:44:34,679 --> 00:44:35,981
- Isn't that just
a name your friend

665
00:44:36,014 --> 00:44:38,050
from the newspaper conjured up?

666
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:38,918
It is.

667
00:44:40,117 --> 00:44:41,286
But I've a feeling
it's gonna stick,

668
00:44:41,318 --> 00:44:42,954
it seems quite fitting.

669
00:44:42,987 --> 00:44:44,056
Not entirely.

670
00:44:44,088 --> 00:44:45,257
Oh?

671
00:44:45,289 --> 00:44:46,692
What's your take on it, then?

672
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:48,293
Everything I know
is in my reports.

673
00:44:48,326 --> 00:44:49,728
Yes.

674
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,697
I'm not interested
in what you know.

675
00:44:53,164 --> 00:44:55,367
I'm interested in
what you think.

676
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,704
I don't follow you?

677
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,706
You're more intimately
acquainted with the injuries

678
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,307
to these girls'
bodies than anybody.

679
00:45:03,307 --> 00:45:04,876
Anybody but the killer himself.

680
00:45:07,244 --> 00:45:10,214
You might have some thoughts,
some suspicions, anything.

681
00:45:10,248 --> 00:45:14,353
I mean, what could make a
man do something like this?

682
00:45:14,385 --> 00:45:16,721
A suspicion doesn't
constitute evidence, Edmund.

683
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,690
I might help.

684
00:45:19,123 --> 00:45:21,059
It might throw some
light on something.

685
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:25,831
For instance, what
weapon is responsible

686
00:45:25,864 --> 00:45:27,065
for these injuries?

687
00:45:27,097 --> 00:45:28,400
It's in my report,
a precision blade.

688
00:45:28,432 --> 00:45:30,268
What does that mean?

689
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,103
A butcher's knife?

690
00:45:31,135 --> 00:45:32,371
No.

691
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:35,273
No, no, something much
sharper, more precise.

692
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,907
A craftsman's blade, perhaps.

693
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,010
A surgeon's scalpel.

694
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:41,713
Possibly, yes.

695
00:45:45,215 --> 00:45:46,652
On the recommendation
of Dr Lowry,

696
00:45:46,684 --> 00:45:48,887
we've got people out
interviewing every butcher

697
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,956
and slaughter man
in the district.

698
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:52,657
Are we wasting our time?

699
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:54,659
I would say so, yes.

700
00:45:54,693 --> 00:45:57,663
The killer's no
butcher, he's precise.

701
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:01,366
And with a knowledge
of the human anatomy.

702
00:46:02,733 --> 00:46:05,403
That missing kidney
was expertly removed.

703
00:46:05,436 --> 00:46:06,771
An educated man?

704
00:46:06,804 --> 00:46:07,772
Almost certainly.

705
00:46:07,806 --> 00:46:08,740
A man of means?

706
00:46:08,773 --> 00:46:09,807
Possibly.

707
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,377
So robbery isn't
his motive, then?

708
00:46:12,409 --> 00:46:16,347
Without a doubt, his motive
is something much darker.

709
00:46:20,452 --> 00:46:23,722
The location and savagery
of the injuries suggest

710
00:46:23,755 --> 00:46:28,059
he takes an abnormal pleasure
in the act of violence.

711
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,132
A prurient pleasure if you like.

712
00:46:38,036 --> 00:46:40,204
There's no shortage of
suspects then, is there?

713
00:46:40,237 --> 00:46:41,205
What do you mean?

714
00:46:44,909 --> 00:46:46,378
It's all around us, Thomas.

715
00:46:48,346 --> 00:46:52,751
In every Penny Dreadful
novel in every corner shop.

716
00:46:52,784 --> 00:46:55,788
The more gruesome the murders
the more the public lap it up.

717
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:59,958
Did you know, householders
in the vicinity

718
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:02,460
of every murder scene are
renting out their upstairs rooms

719
00:47:02,494 --> 00:47:04,829
for people desperate
to catch a glimpse

720
00:47:04,862 --> 00:47:08,266
of where a Ripper
victim met their demise.

721
00:47:11,436 --> 00:47:13,171
I truly believe it's
something buried deep

722
00:47:13,204 --> 00:47:15,106
inside of us, Thomas.

723
00:47:15,139 --> 00:47:17,375
This desire for violence.

724
00:47:17,407 --> 00:47:18,576
In all of us?

725
00:47:18,608 --> 00:47:21,913
If I could get my hands on
the bastard that's behind this.

726
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:28,153
What do you think might
release it, this buried desire?

727
00:47:29,853 --> 00:47:32,890
Could be anything,
I mean, drink, lust.

728
00:47:32,923 --> 00:47:36,527
Do you think it's possible
that the killer himself might

729
00:47:36,561 --> 00:47:38,797
be unaware of his actions?

730
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:39,465
Unaware?

731
00:47:41,498 --> 00:47:42,399
Of crimes so heinous?

732
00:47:42,434 --> 00:47:44,236
Well, if excessive
drink were involved,

733
00:47:44,268 --> 00:47:46,137
in a drunken state many
a man have committed acts

734
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:48,072
that they would
normally find abhorrent.

735
00:47:48,106 --> 00:47:50,509
Almost sounds as if you're
making excuses for him.

736
00:47:52,277 --> 00:47:54,045
No, no not at all.

737
00:47:54,077 --> 00:47:54,880
Another?

738
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,481
If you don't mind.

739
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:05,257
So, we've established the
type of man we're looking for.

740
00:48:06,590 --> 00:48:09,193
An educated man, a
gentleman, quite possibly

741
00:48:09,226 --> 00:48:10,228
some knowledge of surgery.

742
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:11,896
Yes.

743
00:48:11,929 --> 00:48:14,398
What about his truly
defining characteristics?

744
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:15,800
Well, what do you mean?

745
00:48:16,835 --> 00:48:18,503
Simply having
access to scalpel

746
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:21,306
doesn't make one a murderer.

747
00:48:22,907 --> 00:48:27,077
I mean, what makes
a man commit acts

748
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,413
of such appalling degeneracy?

749
00:48:29,447 --> 00:48:31,916
How can you hope to know
that from the evidence in hand?

750
00:48:31,949 --> 00:48:32,917
Think, damn it!

751
00:48:39,623 --> 00:48:43,427
Well, there was one thing
that struck me as odd.

752
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,999
I didn't mention
it in my reports

753
00:48:48,032 --> 00:48:50,202
'cause I wasn't exactly
sure how to phrase it.

754
00:48:52,469 --> 00:48:57,475
The way in which the wounds
are inflicted is inconsistent.

755
00:48:59,878 --> 00:49:00,979
So you think there's
more than one of them?

756
00:49:01,012 --> 00:49:03,949
No, not between the killings,

757
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:06,985
I mean each one is inconsistent.

758
00:49:07,018 --> 00:49:09,588
The initial attacks,
the throat slash

759
00:49:09,621 --> 00:49:11,289
and the abdominal stabbings,

760
00:49:12,891 --> 00:49:14,526
it's all done very fast and
with considerable force.

761
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:16,061
In the heat of
passion, you might say?

762
00:49:16,094 --> 00:49:19,463
You might, yes, but
then the internal wounds,

763
00:49:20,565 --> 00:49:24,001
the organ removal,
this was done carefully

764
00:49:24,034 --> 00:49:29,007
and with precision, almost as
if by another hand entirely.

765
00:49:30,173 --> 00:49:32,277
So you do think there's
more than one of them?

766
00:49:32,309 --> 00:49:33,210
No, no, no,

767
00:49:33,244 --> 00:49:34,112
I was speaking figuratively.

768
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:37,883
It's clearly the same
blade, I just wondered.

769
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,454
Does this provide any clue as
to the killer's intentions?

770
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:47,092
The murders are
committed very fast-

771
00:49:47,125 --> 00:49:49,193
- Not just fast, frenzied.

772
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:53,998
Once the victim is dead, a
different motivation takes over

773
00:49:54,032 --> 00:49:56,934
a more careful, planned act.

774
00:49:58,402 --> 00:49:59,237
But why?

775
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:07,579
To send a message.

776
00:50:10,114 --> 00:50:14,385
To who?

777
00:50:14,418 --> 00:50:15,253
To us.

778
00:50:22,726 --> 00:50:23,961
The time!

779
00:50:23,994 --> 00:50:26,030
Sorry, Thomas, I've kept you.

780
00:50:26,063 --> 00:50:28,000
Don't concern
yourself, Edmund.

781
00:50:34,038 --> 00:50:35,240
I am my own man after all.

782
00:51:09,072 --> 00:51:10,375
You still here, sir?

783
00:51:11,342 --> 00:51:12,978
I was just on my way out.

784
00:51:13,010 --> 00:51:15,646
Just going over these medical
reports for the 100th time.

785
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:18,449
If you're angling
for overtime,

786
00:51:18,483 --> 00:51:21,152
the Chief Inspector's
not back 'til tomorrow.

787
00:51:22,353 --> 00:51:24,289
Just trying to
make sense of it all.

788
00:51:24,322 --> 00:51:26,758
There's no sense
to made of it.

789
00:51:26,791 --> 00:51:27,993
What do you mean?

790
00:51:28,025 --> 00:51:29,360
Well, he's mad, sir.

791
00:51:29,393 --> 00:51:30,995
Whoever's doing it.

792
00:51:31,028 --> 00:51:34,565
There's no use trying to make
sense of what a madman does.

793
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:39,104
If it made sense, he
wouldn't be mad, would he?

794
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,072
Stands to reason.

795
00:51:40,938 --> 00:51:42,106
Well that's cleared
things up no end.

796
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,273
Glad to hear it, sir.

797
00:51:43,306 --> 00:51:44,108
Goodnight.

798
00:51:45,076 --> 00:51:46,043
Goodnight.

799
00:51:48,813 --> 00:51:51,115
Had a bit to drink have we?

800
00:51:51,148 --> 00:51:53,050
Never mind, I've got
just the girl for you.

801
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:56,221
Up the stairs, last
door on your left.

802
00:51:57,221 --> 00:51:58,623
Not me!

803
00:51:58,655 --> 00:52:02,126
Up the stairs with you,
last door on your left!

804
00:54:01,211 --> 00:54:02,313
Oh, come on!

805
00:54:02,346 --> 00:54:04,181
Ain't you got no home to go to?

806
00:54:05,248 --> 00:54:06,317
What is it?

807
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:09,386
It's ten o'clock in the
morning, that's what it is.

808
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:10,755
This ain't no doss house.

809
00:54:10,788 --> 00:54:11,623
Come on!

810
00:54:14,625 --> 00:54:19,630
Cathy?

811
00:54:22,733 --> 00:54:25,937
Cathy?

812
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,946
Oh, erm, good morning.

813
00:54:34,978 --> 00:54:36,947
What's left of it.

814
00:54:36,981 --> 00:54:38,716
You're supposed to be
here at eight on the dot.

815
00:54:38,748 --> 00:54:40,184
Yes, I-

816
00:54:40,217 --> 00:54:41,618
- And the door was unlocked!

817
00:54:41,652 --> 00:54:42,720
It's a good job the
reports were in my office,

818
00:54:42,753 --> 00:54:45,289
you know how valuable they
are in the wrong hands.

819
00:54:46,757 --> 00:54:49,626
Sorry sir, I thought
you'd wanna know right away.

820
00:54:49,659 --> 00:54:51,395
Not another one?

821
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:53,764
Just up the road.

822
00:54:53,797 --> 00:54:55,299
Thomas, why don't
you come with us?

823
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,534
What?

824
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:58,436
It might be useful
to see a body in situ.

825
00:54:58,469 --> 00:54:59,671
No thanks-

826
00:54:59,704 --> 00:55:01,239
- Come on, looks like
you could do with a walk

827
00:55:01,271 --> 00:55:01,905
in the fresh air.

828
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,430
Up here, last
door on the left.

829
00:55:32,335 --> 00:55:33,404
Thomas, are you coming?

830
00:55:34,771 --> 00:55:37,641
Just catching my breath.

831
00:56:07,304 --> 00:56:09,740
You would've thought he'd
be used to this kind of thing.

832
00:56:26,056 --> 00:56:29,293
I need to tell you
something, Edmund,

833
00:56:32,329 --> 00:56:33,864
and let the chips
fall where they may.

834
00:56:35,965 --> 00:56:37,402
What are you talking about?

835
00:56:40,804 --> 00:56:42,806
I've been here before.

836
00:56:46,409 --> 00:56:48,045
I've been to that room.

837
00:56:50,347 --> 00:56:51,849
What is it you're
trying to say?

838
00:56:52,817 --> 00:56:53,684
It's the drink.

839
00:56:56,387 --> 00:56:57,455
I black out.

840
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:03,295
And then when I wake up, I
don't know what I've done.

841
00:57:08,565 --> 00:57:13,003
I think those killings,

842
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:17,775
I think I-

843
00:57:20,378 --> 00:57:21,846
- Inspector?

844
00:57:21,878 --> 00:57:23,114
There's a Miss Levine up here.

845
00:57:23,146 --> 00:57:24,849
She wants to see you.

846
00:57:24,882 --> 00:57:25,849
Oh Christ.

847
00:57:26,983 --> 00:57:28,018
Bare with me, Thomas.

848
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:47,472
That girl was like a
daughter to me, Edmund.

849
00:57:47,505 --> 00:57:48,340
They all are.

850
00:57:51,175 --> 00:57:52,410
I'm so sorry.

851
00:57:55,012 --> 00:57:56,548
Sorry, yeah, well.

852
00:57:58,114 --> 00:57:58,949
I bet you are.

853
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:03,387
I thought you were gonna
do something about this?

854
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,389
I thought you were gonna
catch this bastard?

855
00:58:05,422 --> 00:58:06,957
I thought you cared
about these girls,

856
00:58:06,990 --> 00:58:09,994
but, you're just like
all the other coppers.

857
00:58:13,496 --> 00:58:15,532
I know what you think.

858
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:19,436
You think it's a sordid
business, what goes on here.

859
00:58:20,737 --> 00:58:23,006
But I'll let you in on a
little secret, Inspector.

860
00:58:24,208 --> 00:58:26,077
You know what people
come here for?

861
00:58:28,679 --> 00:58:30,447
What they really come here for?

862
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:34,985
It's love, Edmund.

863
00:58:37,454 --> 00:58:40,424
That's what they long for
and that's what we give them.

864
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:41,893
It might be real love,

865
00:58:41,925 --> 00:58:44,929
but it's as close as some
of those poor buggers

866
00:58:44,961 --> 00:58:45,764
are gonna get.

867
00:58:50,934 --> 00:58:53,471
Isn't that what you
came here for, Edmund?

868
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,710
All those years ago?

869
00:59:00,777 --> 00:59:02,079
My first time in London.

870
00:59:03,813 --> 00:59:05,416
I didn't know a single soul.

871
00:59:06,217 --> 00:59:09,586
A skinny, innocent
young man you were.

872
00:59:12,556 --> 00:59:17,461
And a good deal less innocent
when I left, thanks to you.

873
00:59:22,565 --> 00:59:24,568
Didn't it feel
like love, Edmund?

874
00:59:26,603 --> 00:59:28,071
Just for a moment?

875
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:35,547
Sometimes it still does.

876
00:59:38,782 --> 00:59:40,718
That's just how it should be.

877
00:59:40,751 --> 00:59:41,820
When it's done right.

878
00:59:45,155 --> 00:59:46,557
But all these girls nowadays,

879
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,492
on street corners
and back alleys.

880
00:59:48,525 --> 00:59:50,527
No wonder someone's
turned against them.

881
00:59:52,596 --> 00:59:54,065
I cant help them all, Edmund.

882
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,470
And neither can you, it seems.

883
00:59:59,936 --> 01:00:02,973
This is a difficult case,
the evidence is pointing-

884
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:04,108
- Evidence?

885
01:00:04,141 --> 01:00:07,110
I've got some evidence for
you, for what it's worth.

886
01:00:09,313 --> 01:00:10,181
What is it?

887
01:00:10,213 --> 01:00:11,548
The gentleman's card.

888
01:00:11,581 --> 01:00:12,349
The one Polly
Neilson worked for,

889
01:00:12,382 --> 01:00:14,151
before she was
out on the street.

890
01:00:15,219 --> 01:00:16,686
Bloody hell!

891
01:00:21,257 --> 01:00:23,860
Edmund, about what I said-

892
01:00:23,893 --> 01:00:25,128
- Never mind that!

893
01:00:25,161 --> 01:00:26,497
We've got him!

894
01:00:29,632 --> 01:00:30,268
What?

895
01:00:36,106 --> 01:00:37,208
Dr Lowry.

896
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,041
Inspector?

897
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:40,211
What is all this?

898
01:00:41,311 --> 01:00:43,713
I suppose there's
been some development

899
01:00:43,746 --> 01:00:45,081
you wish to report to me?

900
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:47,817
There has indeed, sir.

901
01:00:47,851 --> 01:00:49,820
So, you've caught the man?

902
01:00:49,853 --> 01:00:51,021
You have him in custody?

903
01:00:52,889 --> 01:00:54,759
He is at this very
moment within the walls

904
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,092
of this police station.

905
01:00:56,126 --> 01:00:57,228
Excellent news!

906
01:00:58,329 --> 01:01:01,666
And what manner of
man or beast is he?

907
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,633
Have you questioned him?

908
01:01:02,666 --> 01:01:03,734
I am endeavoring to so.

909
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:06,269
Doesn't even speak the
Queen's English, I expect.

910
01:01:06,302 --> 01:01:11,308
But first sir, I need to
ask what your particular

911
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,210
interests in this case?

912
01:01:14,077 --> 01:01:15,278
My interest?

913
01:01:15,311 --> 01:01:16,813
Well, you've been
extremely forthcoming

914
01:01:16,847 --> 01:01:18,349
in your willingness to assist.

915
01:01:18,382 --> 01:01:22,052
Well naturally, as a
Whitechapel resident,

916
01:01:22,085 --> 01:01:24,087
and one of the better
ones if I may say,

917
01:01:25,255 --> 01:01:27,892
I took it upon myself
to strive tirelessly

918
01:01:27,925 --> 01:01:29,660
until the culprit
was apprehended.

919
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:32,096
Which has involved, as
you previously stated,

920
01:01:32,128 --> 01:01:33,697
going from door to door.

921
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,633
Well I didn't go myself,

922
01:01:35,666 --> 01:01:38,836
I have other things to attend
to, but I organized a group

923
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:42,173
of similarly concerned
citizens to do so.

924
01:01:42,206 --> 01:01:44,141
Purely as a concerned citizen?

925
01:01:44,173 --> 01:01:45,275
Yes.

926
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:48,379
So you don't have personal
connection to this case?

927
01:01:48,411 --> 01:01:49,779
Personal connection?

928
01:01:49,813 --> 01:01:51,715
I should say not.

929
01:01:51,748 --> 01:01:52,549
What are you suggesting?

930
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:53,751
I'm not suggesting
anything, sir.

931
01:01:53,784 --> 01:01:55,152
It sounds to me very much

932
01:01:55,184 --> 01:01:57,922
like you are
suggesting something.

933
01:01:59,856 --> 01:02:02,692
Do you think a man of my
standing would have anything

934
01:02:02,726 --> 01:02:05,630
to do with the sort of
people involved in this case?

935
01:02:05,663 --> 01:02:07,298
Or, or any murder,
for that matter?

936
01:02:09,065 --> 01:02:12,402
I must warn you, I'm
a very good friend

937
01:02:12,436 --> 01:02:14,204
of your Chief Inspector.

938
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:20,644
Be that as it may, I
need to ask you outright,

939
01:02:21,411 --> 01:02:24,915
and I require a truthful answer.

940
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:29,120
Do you have any
personal connection

941
01:02:29,152 --> 01:02:32,722
to any of the
victims in this case?

942
01:02:32,755 --> 01:02:33,391
No.

943
01:02:33,423 --> 01:02:36,192
Mary Jane Keates?

944
01:02:36,226 --> 01:02:37,028
Annie Chaplin?

945
01:02:37,061 --> 01:02:37,862
No.

946
01:02:37,894 --> 01:02:38,929
Polly Neilson?

947
01:02:38,961 --> 01:02:39,797
No!

948
01:02:42,298 --> 01:02:44,768
Can you confirm that
this is your card, sir?

949
01:02:46,202 --> 01:02:47,103
Yes, of course it is,
it's got my name on, man.

950
01:02:47,137 --> 01:02:48,339
And where did you get it?

951
01:02:48,371 --> 01:02:49,572
I got it from a
house of ill-repute,

952
01:02:49,606 --> 01:02:53,411
where this morning the body of
Catherine Eastwood was found

953
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:56,380
with her stomach opened
from top to bottom.

954
01:02:56,413 --> 01:02:58,782
Are you out of
your mind, Inspector?

955
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:00,083
Well somebody is!

956
01:03:04,221 --> 01:03:09,226
I have never set foot
in that establishment.

957
01:03:10,393 --> 01:03:11,761
It was left there
by Polly Neilson.

958
01:03:11,795 --> 01:03:14,731
I told you I
don't know the girl.

959
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:24,408
I spoke to a few
of her acquaintances

960
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,176
on the way back here.

961
01:03:26,210 --> 01:03:27,711
It's easy enough to do so,

962
01:03:28,911 --> 01:03:30,847
there's plenty that knew
her down at the doss house.

963
01:03:33,382 --> 01:03:36,788
Turns out, "Polly" was a name
she acquired on the streets.

964
01:03:37,987 --> 01:03:41,692
Her real name was
Mary Anne Neilson.

965
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:47,164
Ring a bell does it, sir?

966
01:03:48,331 --> 01:03:52,802
I do recall a girl
of that name, yes.

967
01:03:52,835 --> 01:03:54,104
Worked for you as a maid.

968
01:03:54,137 --> 01:03:56,007
You have to
understand, Inspector,

969
01:03:57,173 --> 01:03:59,275
these girls come
and go all the time.

970
01:03:59,309 --> 01:04:00,478
My housekeeper takes
care of it all.

971
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:02,880
But you remember
this one, don't you?

972
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:07,985
She told her story quite
liberally down at the doss house.

973
01:04:08,018 --> 01:04:09,853
She was stealing, I had
to have her dismissed.

974
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:11,856
Dismissed her
personally, I believe?

975
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:13,524
Threw her out on her
ear without two pennies

976
01:04:13,556 --> 01:04:14,924
to rub together.

977
01:04:14,958 --> 01:04:16,360
Is it any wonder she
ended up where she did?

978
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:17,961
A thief deserves no better.

979
01:04:17,994 --> 01:04:19,763
How did you know
she was a thief?

980
01:04:21,398 --> 01:04:24,469
She had taken pieces
of silver cutlery.

981
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:27,805
Go on.

982
01:04:29,273 --> 01:04:32,876
She secreted them in her
undergarments, isn't that so?

983
01:04:34,478 --> 01:04:37,947
Where you found them, in
the course of performing

984
01:04:37,981 --> 01:04:40,885
an indecent act upon her
person, isn't that so Dr Lowry?

985
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:44,155
Damn you, Inspector, this
is no business of yours!

986
01:04:44,188 --> 01:04:48,092
And it has nothing to
do with these murders.

987
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:50,860
Oh, I think it's got a lot
to do with these murders.

988
01:04:50,893 --> 01:04:52,529
I think it was entirely
in your interests

989
01:04:52,563 --> 01:04:56,099
that Mary Anne Neilson should
meet her fate that night.

990
01:04:56,132 --> 01:04:58,001
I'm sure you told her
to keep her mouth shut

991
01:04:58,034 --> 01:05:01,004
but there was no way of
making sure, was there?

992
01:05:01,038 --> 01:05:03,840
And having done it once you
acquired a taste for it.

993
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:08,311
Before you deny it, let
me reveal one other fact.

994
01:05:08,344 --> 01:05:10,313
According to the expert analysis

995
01:05:10,347 --> 01:05:13,517
of the Police Medical
Examiner, these murders are not

996
01:05:13,550 --> 01:05:16,854
the work of some butcher
or slaughter man.

997
01:05:18,222 --> 01:05:20,424
The injuries inflicted
upon these bodies were done

998
01:05:20,456 --> 01:05:24,561
by the hand of an educated
man with clear knowledge

999
01:05:24,594 --> 01:05:28,098
of human anatomy, quite possibly
a doctor such as yourself.

1000
01:05:30,199 --> 01:05:33,036
And can I also make it plain
that consider your actions

1001
01:05:33,070 --> 01:05:35,506
since the first murder
to be highly suspicious.

1002
01:05:36,873 --> 01:05:39,542
You have shown an unnatural
interest in the case,

1003
01:05:39,576 --> 01:05:41,512
attempting to railroad
the investigation off

1004
01:05:41,545 --> 01:05:43,380
in inappropriate directions,

1005
01:05:43,413 --> 01:05:45,849
all the time trying to
shift blame from yourself.

1006
01:05:47,251 --> 01:05:50,588
So, Dr Lowry, I have every
justification in bringing you

1007
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:53,590
in here for questioning, and
the question I would like

1008
01:05:53,623 --> 01:05:58,461
to ask you, is can you
account for your movements

1009
01:05:58,494 --> 01:06:00,998
over the last two nights?

1010
01:06:07,036 --> 01:06:12,042
I think, perhaps, you should
ask your Chief Inspector

1011
01:06:12,643 --> 01:06:13,443
that question.

1012
01:06:15,545 --> 01:06:19,050
The Chief Inspector can
account for my movements.

1013
01:06:20,217 --> 01:06:22,552
Along with around
three dozen members

1014
01:06:22,585 --> 01:06:24,221
of his extended family.

1015
01:06:27,291 --> 01:06:30,260
I've been away in Guildford
for the past two days

1016
01:06:31,695 --> 01:06:33,998
attending my God
Daughter's wedding.

1017
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,534
My God Daughter who also happens

1018
01:06:37,567 --> 01:06:42,005
to be the niece of
your Chief Inspector.

1019
01:06:43,673 --> 01:06:47,978
They even had us pose for one
of those wretched photographs.

1020
01:06:50,947 --> 01:06:52,949
I'm sure you can
examine the plates.

1021
01:07:02,492 --> 01:07:06,898
Don't think for a moment
this ends here, Inspector.

1022
01:07:22,112 --> 01:07:22,980
Did he confess?

1023
01:07:24,181 --> 01:07:26,117
God in heaven, please
tell me he confessed.

1024
01:07:28,117 --> 01:07:30,621
It wasn't him, airtight alibi.

1025
01:07:30,653 --> 01:07:31,454
But you said...

1026
01:07:31,487 --> 01:07:32,288
I know.

1027
01:07:32,322 --> 01:07:33,590
But it had to be him!

1028
01:07:33,623 --> 01:07:35,525
It wasn't him.

1029
01:07:35,559 --> 01:07:36,427
Not a chance.

1030
01:07:42,532 --> 01:07:44,936
You shouldn't take things
so personally, Thomas.

1031
01:07:46,003 --> 01:07:47,104
It'll come to no good.

1032
01:07:48,438 --> 01:07:50,273
I've had to learn
that lesson myself.

1033
01:07:53,275 --> 01:07:55,078
Take a holiday.

1034
01:07:55,112 --> 01:07:57,181
The case isn't gonna go
away in your absence.

1035
01:08:02,184 --> 01:08:03,987
I know it's none of my business,

1036
01:08:05,554 --> 01:08:07,090
go easy on the bottle, old man.

1037
01:08:10,027 --> 01:08:11,595
You look like death.

1038
01:08:20,503 --> 01:08:21,704
It cant be true.

1039
01:08:28,712 --> 01:08:30,047
It cant be true.

1040
01:09:19,662 --> 01:09:21,097
Good evening, Thomas.

1041
01:09:25,601 --> 01:09:27,203
Is something amiss?

1042
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:31,842
No, I just... um-

1043
01:09:31,875 --> 01:09:33,577
- There's a spare
key to that cabinet

1044
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:35,311
in your desk drawer, Thomas.

1045
01:09:36,645 --> 01:09:38,048
Perhaps you'd forgotten?

1046
01:09:40,117 --> 01:09:42,153
And I'm not a fool, Thomas.

1047
01:09:46,155 --> 01:09:47,824
Perhaps you'd
forgotten that as well?

1048
01:09:51,862 --> 01:09:53,463
So I'll ask again.

1049
01:09:55,498 --> 01:09:57,233
Is something amiss?

1050
01:09:58,768 --> 01:10:02,172
Just, just this.

1051
01:10:03,439 --> 01:10:05,408
Something else from
your desk drawer.

1052
01:10:06,510 --> 01:10:08,445
What's it, what's it doing-

1053
01:10:08,478 --> 01:10:11,181
- I left it where I knew
you'd find it Thomas.

1054
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:13,484
Because I wanted you to know.

1055
01:10:16,185 --> 01:10:17,420
To know what?

1056
01:10:20,724 --> 01:10:22,693
That I know.

1057
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:32,136
I know about the
secret little bottles,

1058
01:10:32,168 --> 01:10:36,206
sewn into pockets and
hidden behind books.

1059
01:10:36,238 --> 01:10:37,306
Elizabeth, I...

1060
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:41,345
And I know about the secret
little walks into town.

1061
01:10:43,412 --> 01:10:46,382
The midnight, moonlit walks.

1062
01:10:48,918 --> 01:10:51,287
I know where you go.

1063
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:52,856
And I know what you do.

1064
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:59,496
I've walked out in your
shadow on many occasions.

1065
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,237
I'm telling you this, Thomas,

1066
01:11:08,238 --> 01:11:11,809
because from now on,
it's going to stop.

1067
01:11:16,746 --> 01:11:19,449
In fact, I've made sure of it.

1068
01:11:22,284 --> 01:11:26,356
At least with regard to
those particular girls.

1069
01:11:30,226 --> 01:11:31,228
You won't be seeing
any of them again.

1070
01:11:34,730 --> 01:11:36,599
Except, perhaps, at your work.

1071
01:11:39,502 --> 01:11:40,704
Dear God, Elizabeth.

1072
01:11:41,604 --> 01:11:42,772
What are you saying?

1073
01:11:42,805 --> 01:11:45,474
The whores got
what they deserved!

1074
01:11:48,979 --> 01:11:51,248
Abusing their womanhood,

1075
01:11:52,414 --> 01:11:57,220
using it to steal the
husbands of good women!

1076
01:11:59,889 --> 01:12:02,226
You're a weak man, Thomas.

1077
01:12:03,592 --> 01:12:07,230
Easily led from the
straight and narrow path.

1078
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,404
That's why I blame
them, rather than you.

1079
01:12:16,305 --> 01:12:19,242
That's why I had
to do what I did.

1080
01:12:24,546 --> 01:12:26,616
Christ in heaven, Elizabeth.

1081
01:12:28,417 --> 01:12:29,485
You'll hang for this.

1082
01:12:31,854 --> 01:12:32,755
Why should I?

1083
01:12:33,957 --> 01:12:35,993
No one but you or
I will ever know.

1084
01:12:37,961 --> 01:12:42,365
And in case you ever think
of sharing this knowledge,

1085
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:47,404
think on this, Thomas, there
is no evidence to connect me

1086
01:12:48,037 --> 01:12:49,472
to these events.

1087
01:12:52,074 --> 01:12:53,344
But as for you-

1088
01:12:55,612 --> 01:12:56,680
- What are you saying?

1089
01:12:57,881 --> 01:13:01,318
If anyone ever asks
me your whereabouts

1090
01:13:01,350 --> 01:13:04,255
on certain times or dates, well-

1091
01:13:05,454 --> 01:13:08,826
- There is evidence, somewhere.

1092
01:13:10,659 --> 01:13:12,028
Certain organs were removed.

1093
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:16,500
Oh, Thomas, you disappoint me.

1094
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:22,640
I never blamed you, Thomas,

1095
01:13:24,373 --> 01:13:28,278
but I must admit
a certain pleasure

1096
01:13:29,712 --> 01:13:32,750
in seeing you destroy the
very evidence you speak of.

1097
01:13:35,085 --> 01:13:40,291
And watching you
enjoy every last bite.

1098
01:13:53,403 --> 01:13:54,905
It's getting late.

1099
01:13:58,475 --> 01:14:00,711
We should head to the bedroom.

1100
01:14:06,149 --> 01:14:08,052
Perhaps you can lie
beside me tonight?

1101
01:14:54,463 --> 01:14:55,931
Morning Thomas.

1102
01:14:55,965 --> 01:14:57,534
I was just on my way out.

1103
01:14:58,501 --> 01:14:59,101
On your rounds?

1104
01:14:59,135 --> 01:14:59,970
No.

1105
01:15:01,069 --> 01:15:02,405
Out for good.

1106
01:15:02,439 --> 01:15:03,673
Chief Inspector's orders.

1107
01:15:05,507 --> 01:15:06,943
Seems my handling
of the Ripper case

1108
01:15:06,975 --> 01:15:09,380
wasn't as successful
as he would have liked.

1109
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:11,949
You cant win them all.

1110
01:15:13,983 --> 01:15:14,818
I suppose not.

1111
01:15:16,685 --> 01:15:18,454
Funny thing though,
there hasn't been

1112
01:15:18,488 --> 01:15:20,990
another murder for the
last couple of days.

1113
01:15:21,024 --> 01:15:22,126
Perhaps it's all over.

1114
01:15:23,859 --> 01:15:25,461
Perhaps it is.

1115
01:15:25,494 --> 01:15:27,163
We can
but hope, anyway.

1116
01:15:28,497 --> 01:15:29,899
You seem to be taking it well.

1117
01:15:31,467 --> 01:15:32,802
I thought it was
your life's work,

1118
01:15:32,836 --> 01:15:34,438
bringing justice to Whitechapel?

1119
01:15:36,538 --> 01:15:38,509
I may have been
wrong about that.

1120
01:15:40,577 --> 01:15:41,412
I'm sure I was.

1121
01:15:43,746 --> 01:15:46,449
There's more to life
that work, Thomas.

1122
01:15:48,217 --> 01:15:51,488
And whatever else
happens, life goes on.

1123
01:15:52,555 --> 01:15:53,590
Yes.

1124
01:15:56,225 --> 01:15:59,496
Well, the best of luck to you.

1125
01:15:59,529 --> 01:16:02,933
I, er, I've got an
appointment to keep.

1126
01:16:04,900 --> 01:16:07,570
You going somewhere, pleasant?

1127
01:16:10,539 --> 01:16:11,475
Just up the road.

1128
01:17:26,783 --> 01:17:28,285
Are you set to go?

1129
01:17:29,351 --> 01:17:30,586
I am.

1130
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,826
So, where are we going?

1131
01:17:39,662 --> 01:17:42,231
Somewhere a long
way from here.
