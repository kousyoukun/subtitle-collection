The sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.

110
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:42,960
如果在野外 我攻裟愕
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

哪怕你不在我的食物Y 
Even if you weren't in my food chain,

I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!

115
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,567
然後上你的女友
And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

Lions don't like water.

118
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:04,884
你硬把它放在河流或者淡水的旁 
If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source,

119
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,720
倒是行得通
 that'd make sense.

120
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,053
但假使你在海中 二十英尺高的巨浪
But you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,

如果你敢M入金~群 
You've wandered into our school of tuna,
