00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,749
在纽约 法律与混乱有明显的界限
In New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.

6
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,615
在那条界限上的是丹森和海史密斯
On that line live Danson and Highsmith.

7
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,348
再说一遍我为什么要爬上车顶!
Tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!

8
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,730
我觉得你可以归罪于错误的人生选择
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.

9
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,040
干掉那个混蛋
Get rid of that asshole.

10
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,083
啊哦      我讨厌你说"啊哦"
Uh-oh!        I hate it when you say "uh-oh!"

11
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,761
老兄 你身手真敏捷!
Dude, you put a ding in my hood!

12
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,658
放马过来啊!
Come on with it, then!

13
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,280
麻烦了
That's trouble.

14
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,573
谁打了九夭夭吗?
Did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?

15
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,678
到此结束了 我厌倦了逃来逃去
That's it. I'm sick of all this running.

16
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,680
抓紧了!
Hang on!

17
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:53,072
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent!

18
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,200
但我想听你尖叫!
But I wanna hear you scream!

19
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,783
卧倒!
Down on the ground!

20
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,287
探员 嘿 探员
Detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!

21
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,021
一个个来 好不好?
One at a time, all right?

22
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,956
探员们 我是雷克·格雷森 
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,

23
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:22,278
来自纽约观察者网的记者
 New York Observer Online.

24
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,436
这些嫌犯被逮捕时只发现持有0.25磅的大麻
These suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana,

25
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,937
在一些州只算轻罪
a misdemeanor in some states.

26
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,475
你认为这次造成1200万损失的逮捕行动值得吗?
Do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?

27
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,707
为什么不让纽约回答这个问题?
Why don't we let New York City answer that question?

28
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,271
这是世界上最好的城市!
The greatest city on Earth, yeah!

29
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,819
你好 来自TMZ出版社的莎拉·加夫尼
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.

30
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,483
丹森 你和金姆·卡丹森的绯闻是真的吗?
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?

31
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,151
我不做评论
No comment.

32
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,993
但 是的
But, yes.

33
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,056
丹森和海史密斯 终生都有免费热狗吃!
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!

34
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,668
但饮料不免费 我不能亏太多啊
No drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.

35
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,210
丹森和海史密斯无论射击 开车 做爱都有型 
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style.

36
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,471
他们是明星
 They're rock stars.

37
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,573
然后才轮到讲笑话的 打球的 兽医
Then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets...

38
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,585
和二流人物
...and the other guys.

39
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,516
我们知道 我们知道 我们知道
We know, we know. We know.

40
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,788
好好好 听我说! 听我说!
All right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!

41
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,423
今晚我们在巴特酒店开庆祝会
We're having a celebration tonight at Butter.

42
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,093
布罗迪·珍妮会去 还有白灵
Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.

43
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,966
来自泽西海岸的小婊子      耶!
That little short bitch from Jersey Shore.        Yeah!

44
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,532
你们大部分都被邀请了
And most of you are on the list.

45
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,142
你们最棒
You're the best.

46
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,178
同志们 我现在有话要说
Guys, I'm gonna say something right now.

47
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,645
关于一个来自奥地利的有梦想的人
It's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.

48
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,547
阿诺·施瓦辛格!      让我说完
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        Let me finish.

49
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,017
他先成为冠军后来做了影星 懂吗?
He became a champion and then a movie star, all right?

50
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,281
阿诺·施瓦辛格!      该死 让我说...
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        God damn it, let me...

51
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,289
你毁了这故事 你毁了这故事
They ruined the story. They ruined the story.

52
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,984
重要的是
Let...What...The point is,

53
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,701
我们没有今天的成就 
we couldn't do our job

54
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,154
如果没有你们做文书工作
if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork,

55
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,527
接电话 还有其他我们不愿做的事
answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do.

56
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,622
那些枪战 那些追捕行动
all the gun fights all the car chases

57
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,568
那些我们本不想却又不得不上的女人
all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to,

58
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,334
都是因为有了你们 谢谢
all due to what you guys do. Thank you.

59
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,670
而且我们周而复始地做着
And we'd do it again and again.

60
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,040
闭上你的臭嘴
Hey, you shut your face!

61
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,339
如果你要讲话
If we wanna hear you talk,

62
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,314
我就把手从你屁眼里伸进去 然后把你当木偶耍!
I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!

63
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,074
听到了没? 听到了没?
You hear me? You hear me?

64
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,551
酒吧见      对
Cash bar.        Yeah.

65
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,484
老实点 混蛋们
Peace out, bitches.

66
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,825
好 伙计们 靠近点
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.

67
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,383
来吧 靠近点
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

68
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,652
对 这里就行了
All right, right there.

69
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,698
后退 就站在这里
Just back up, just like right there.

70
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,392
好 再退...再前进...
All right, just one...Just a...

71
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,230
对对对 就是这里 就是这里
There you go, right there. Right there.

72
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,896
这是他们的文书工作 你们知道他们不会做的
This is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.

73
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,203
没错 这些文书工作就像鲍勃的老婆
That's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.

74
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,939
又厚又无趣 满是丹森的指纹
It's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.

75
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,445
无冒犯之意 鲍勃      没关系
No offense, Bob.        That's all right.

76
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,675
无论如何 谁要做?      我要!
Anyway, now who wants it?        I do!

77
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,712
好的 这活给文书呆子和扬基剪子了!
All right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!

78
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,006
好好干 谢谢 艾伦      谢谢长官
Nice work. Thanks, Allen.        Thank you, Captain.

79
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:56,950
"给我做 给我做"
"I'll do it! I'll do it!"

80
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,126
别再哼那个歌啦!
Stop humming that song!

81
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,961
我想哼就哼      不 我知道你想
I can hum if I want to.        No, I know you can.

82
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,300
但我偏要你停
I'm asking you to stop.

83
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,632
如果你要求的话 我就停      谢谢
Well, if you're asking, then I'll stop.        Thank you.

84
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,740
你可不可以不那样笑?
Could you not smile like that?

85
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,432
你因为自己的感情
Now you're asking me to mask my emotions 

86
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,751
而要求我掩饰我的感情
because of how it makes you feel.

87
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,551
我才不干呢
That I will not do.

88
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,226
说真的 不要再哼了 好吗?
Seriously, stop humming! Okay?

89
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,320
这不是财会统计
This isn't accounting or wherever the hell

90
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,764
你别以为用你的小计算器就能搞定
you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.

91
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,103
法务会计 好不好 这工作很重要的
Forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.

92
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:45,844
随你便 
Yeah, whatever. 

93
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:48,966
做这种垃圾工作就别屁颠屁颠的啦 你个傻帽
Stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.

94
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,940
同志们 提醒一下
Hey, guys. Reminder.

95
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,241
警署的野餐聚会将在周末举办
The police union picnic's coming up this weekend.

96
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,943
我老婆要做拿手菜芥末蛋 我的肚子又要撑大喽
My wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.

97
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,417
现在不该说那个 鲍勃
It's a bad time, Bob!

98
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,515
好吧
All right.

99
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,182
去吃块蛋糕
Going to get a slice.

100
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,633
你知道我刚才看到什么了?
You know what I just did?

101
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,002
我一出门 就看到一些探员
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives,

102
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,598
他们马上就要在你背后说坏话了
and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back,

103
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,871
但是我没有说你坏话 因为我爸妈教我
but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me

104
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,606
在背后说别人坏话的人是懦夫
that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.

105
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,875
哇 我很感激
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

106
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,779
好 因为我要当面说你的坏话
Good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.

107
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,615
不 你不必        不 我不喜欢你
No. You don't have to.        No, I don't like you.

108
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,120
我觉得你不是真警察
I think you're a fake cop.

109
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,955
你小便时候的声音 听起来跟个娘们似的
The sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.

110
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,790
如果在野外 我会攻击你的
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

111
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,670
哪怕你不在我的食物链里 
Even if you weren't in my food chain, 

112
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,562
我也会破例把你给宰了
I would go out of my way to attack you.

113
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,225
如果我是雄狮 你是个金枪鱼
If I were a lion, and you were a tuna,

114
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,929
我会游在海中把你吃掉
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!

115
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,397
然后上你的女友
And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

116
00:07:55,508 --> 00:08:00,242
首先 怎么会有会游泳的狮子?
Okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?

117
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,256
狮子不喜欢水
Lions don't like water.

118
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,714
你硬把它放在河流或者淡水的旁边 
If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source,

119
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,550
倒是行得通
 that'd make sense.

120
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,883
但假使你在海中 二十英尺高的巨浪
But you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,

121
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,717
我说的是在南非的海域
I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa,

122
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,329
遇到一个八百磅的成年金枪鱼 
coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna 

123
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,357
还有他的二三十个朋友
with his 20 or 30 friends?

124
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,588
你必死无疑
You lose that battle.

125
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,597
你十有八九会死的 你知道吗?
You lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?

126
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,058
如果你胆敢进入金枪鱼群 
You've wandered into our school of tuna,

127
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,966
我们就可以尝到狮子的味道了
 and we now have a taste of lion.

128
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,470
我们和自己讲话 我们交谈
We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.

129
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,732
是吗      然后说"你知道吗?
Yeah?        And said, " You know what?

130
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,970
"狮子味道不错 我们再去吃几个吧"
"Lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion. "

131
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,637
我们就会在滩头建立一个基地
We've developed a system to establish a beachhead

132
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,647
然后蚕食你的整个族群
and aggressively hunt you and your family.

133
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,910
我们会夺走你的骄傲
And we will corner your pride,

134
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,885
你的孩子 你的后代      你怎么做?
your children, your offspring.        How you gonna do that?

135
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,748
我们会用海草做一套呼吸装置
We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.

136
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,115
用来吸收一些氧气
We will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.

137
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,866
一次虽然不能上岸几天 
It's not gonna be days at a time, 

138
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:52,004
但一两个小时绝对没问题
but an hour, hour 45, no problem.

139
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,426
这样我们就可以找出你住在哪里
That will give us enough time to figure out where you live,

140
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,894
回到海洋 摄入更多氧气 然后再跟踪你
go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.

141
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:01,562
你搬石头砸自己的脚 我们武器 人数都比你们多
You just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and outmanned.

142
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,238
你开始是这么想的吗?
Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?

143
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,439
不
Nope.

144
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,614
在开市的两分钟前
Two minutes before the markets open,

145
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,991
帕米拉·博德曼 兰道环球公司的总裁

146
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,140
将按铃宣布市场开放

With Boardman is investment banker, David Ershon,

148
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,254
他拥有兰道集团七百亿资产的百分之四十
who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.

149
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,099
我们亏损了多少?
How much did we lose?

150
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,967
现在您可以按铃了 博德曼女士

152
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,537

153
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,478
去你的!
Shit!

154
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,650
唐人街的三个黑帮痞子 我干掉了两个
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.

155
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,513
嘣嘣      好
Bang, bang.        Yeah.

156
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,512
然后我站起来干掉他们的老大
Then I raise up to take the leader out.

157
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:50,812
妈呀 我好像身临其境
Shit, I feel like I'm there now.

158
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,585
我听到口哨声 我的搭档在屋顶
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.

159
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,490
他说"让我们为民除害"
He says, "Let's even the odds!"

160
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,993
他把用步枪把我击倒 我直接一枪穿膛将他打死
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.

161
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,557
游戏结束了 混蛋们
Game over, bitches.

162
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,332
好了      好

163
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:12,436
吉米? 说说那个故事令你感觉如何?
Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.

164
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,001
好像我的下体是用混凝土做的
Like my cock was made out of concrete.

165
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,248
我知道你很勇敢
I know it's very tempting.

166
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,511
你想令朋友们印象深刻
You want to impress your friends.

167
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,076
但是我们说的是严肃的问题 好不好?
But this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?

168
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,859
要按照职责使用武器
This is firing your weapon in the line of duty.

169
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,949
霍兹警员?

Come on!        Here we go.

172
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,428
你想分享你的故事吗?
Would you like to share?

173
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,656
不 算了吧
No, I'd rather not.

174
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,399
霍兹警员 你来警署六个月了
Officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now,

175
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,264
始终一言不发
and you haven't said a word.

176
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,702
这里很和谐的 没人会对你说三道四
This is a safe room, no judgment here.

177
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,864
蠢蛋
Jerkoff.

178
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,238
你在评论别人 吉米 说吧
That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

179
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,835
我每晚都会想起
I relive it every night.

180
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,112
布朗克斯区 十月
Bronx, October.

181
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,011
世界职业棒球锦标赛第七场

182
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,124
那些大理石 巨大的压力 骚乱的人群 
For all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, 

183
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,348
我在一个隧道里执勤
and I pulled tunnel duty.

184
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,552
我在隧道看到一个黑影 我警告他停下来
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.

185
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:58,255
嘿 嘿 嘿 这里禁止通行
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!

186
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,688
最后还是拿出枪来
Finally pulled my gun.

187
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,056
拿出一个致命武器 他向我跑来
Pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.

188
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,027
不要让我开枪! 我会的!
Don't make me shoot! I'll do it!

189
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,328
你聋了吗? 我说了"不许动"
Are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?

190
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:09,360
你个混蛋! 我是德里克·杰特 你击中我了!
You dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!

191
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,199
你让我输了二十美金!      混蛋
You cost me 20 grand on that game!        Douche bag.

192
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,738
纽约失去了一座冠军啊
Cost the city a championship.

193
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,138
我本来要被提拔到凶杀组的高层
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.

194
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,070
现在和一个做案头工作的傻子搭档 
Now I'm stuck with a desk jockey partner. 

195
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,406
每个人都叫我扬基剪子
Everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.

196
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,872
因为你射中了德里克·杰特
Because you shot Derek Jeter!

197
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,243
他可是双族天使
He's a biracial angel.

198
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,975
你应该向A罗德开枪
You should've shot A-Rod.

199
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,955
嗨 文书呆子

203
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,827
我知道你们觉得有趣 但我不喜欢
I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.

204
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,490

Still working on the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?

这是什么? 看起来傻啦吧唧的
What is this? That looks stupid.

207
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,629
非法建筑工程的批准令 
Guys, it's illegal permitting for construction. 

208
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,933
准确说是脚手架问题
Specifically, scaffolding.

209
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,465
有些人说
Some of the guys were talking.

210
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,071
你在办公室怎么
They were like, " How come you've never 

211
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:53,794
没有用过武器?
fired your weapon in the office before?"

212
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:54,794
说的好
Good point.

213
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,211
对不起 我不懂

你在办公室没有用过武器
You've never fired your weapon in the office.

215

We all have, you know. It's called a desk pop.

216
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,748
同志们 我知道你们不尊重我的工作
Fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.

217
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,981
才没有呢      我不笨
Not true.        I'm not stupid.

218
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,524
我在办公室不会卸下武器
I'm not gonna discharge my firearm in the office.

219
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,184
甘博 听我说 我再说清楚点
Gamble, listen to me. I'll try to make it real clear.

220

我们很尊重你 
We honor the flag, 

221
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:12,425
你要是不开枪你就对不起我们
and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.

222
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,890
吉米 你上次开枪是什么时候

A desk pop?        Yeah.

没这回事
No, that's not real!

234
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:41,082
他们很有说服力啊 他们骗了我!
They were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.

235
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,927
好吧艾伦 你必须交出枪来
All right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.

236

You cream puffs, sit tight.

257
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,345
你在搞什么鬼!
You gotta be shitting me!

258
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,512
你们不能永远把我关在这里 好不好?
You can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?

259
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,680
我是个孔雀 我要飞
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!

260
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,057
他刚刚管自己叫孔雀?
Did he just...Did he just call himself a peacock?

261
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,829
走吧 走吧
Let's go! Let's go!

262
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,930
放马来吧
Come on, fellas!

263
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,573
周三晚上去莱克岛监狱吃玉米卷吧!
Wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!

264
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:52,749
那是本周第二个了!
That's the second one this week!

265
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,417
你们这些小兔崽子! 不要跑!
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!

266
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,221
快走!
Let's go!

267
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,121
好
Yeah!

268
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,892
抬头!
Heads up!

269
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,307
该死
Shit.

270
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,840
特种部队高空滑行
Special Forces zipline.

271
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,913
切掉那根线 切掉! 我们走!
Cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!

272
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,417
这些歹徒是专家      我们上
These guys are pros.        Let's go!

273
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,888
你和我想的一样 搭档?
You thinking what I'm thinking, partner?

274
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,583
朝着灌木丛跳
Aim for the bushes.

275
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,849
警察们还在讨论为何丹森和海史密斯跳了下去
Cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.

276
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,916
也许是因为骄傲 那么多次死里逃生
Maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.

277
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,155
也许是他们太自负了
Maybe their egos pushed them off.

278
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,959
我不知道 但他们真疯狂
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.

279
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,167
无论如何 纽约出现了一个洞 
Either way, there was a hole in New York City, 

280
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,766
需要人来填满
and it needed to be filled.

281
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,135
两天前 纽约哭了
Two days ago, this city wept.

282
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,165
我们失去了奉献了一切的两名英雄
We lost two heroes who gave everything for us,

283
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,444
他们最后的牺牲 
who paid that ultimate sacrifice

284
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,881
也是为了我们能够安全地走在马路上
 so that we may walk these streets safely.

285
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,674
他们跳下去的地方连一个遮雨棚都没有
There wasn't even an awning in their direction.

286
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,945
不 我知道      他们从二十楼跳了下来
No, I know.        They just jumped 20 stories.

287
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,351
这不符合逻辑 对吗?
Doesn't make sense, does it?

288
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,323
我只希望上帝可以让他们把警察配枪带到天堂
I only hope God lets them take their. 357s with them to heaven.

289
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,663
我们的时代来临了 艾伦 
It's our moment, Allen. 

290
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,726
我们代替他俩的时代来临了
Our moment to step up and be the guys.

291
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,891
我们还在葬礼上呢 给他们点尊重吧      什么?
We're at a funeral. Show some respect.        What?

292
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,825
你不觉得每一个在场的警察
You don't think every other detective here

293
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,081
都在想同一件事吗?
 isn't thinking the same thing?

294
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,501
艾伦 听我说 丹森和海史密斯已经死了
Allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.

295
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,199
他们人去桌空 总得有人填补他们的职位
Their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.

296
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,837
那就是我们了好不好? 纽约现在急缺英雄
That someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.

297
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,670
是吗?      是的
Is it?        Yeah.

298
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,378
那要是九百万个有社交意识 有团队精神的公民
What about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens,

299
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,215
都想要代替他们的位置怎么办?
all just stepping up and doing their part?

300
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,551
小时候 你没有玩过警察抓小偷?
As a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?

301
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,817
我告诉你我小时候做过什么吧
I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.

302
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,224
我去上学 整理床铺
I went to school and made my bed.

303
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,922
十一岁时 我审查了我父母的账本
And at age 11, I audited my parents.

304
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,330
我告诉你 事情出了点小差错 我就被他们禁足了
And believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.

305
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,266
你是从哪来的怪胎啊?
What the hell are you?

306
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,338
哟哟哟 看看谁来了
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

307
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,109
看看这两个傻蛋 
Look at these two jamokes, would you? 

308
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,503
一个射中了杰特 另一个在警署开枪
One shot Jeter and the other shot an office.

309
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,510
嘴巴干净点 我们还在参加葬礼呢
Have some decorum. We're at a funeral.

310
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,777
你要跳舞吗 小样?
You wanna dance, brolio?

311
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,693
我要用我的巨根爆你菊花
I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks. 

312
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,238
让你后庭流血
You'll be pissing blood out of your ass.

313
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,853
惨啊
That's horrible.

314
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:39,550
你靠那么近干嘛?
Why don't you step back, man?

315
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,092
你敢碰他 我对上帝发誓
You touch him, I swear to God

316
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,094
我会用艾伦的头把你打得屁股开花
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.

317
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,920
他不会这么做的 他只是虚张声势 不过有点怪异
He's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.

318
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,728
你想打架?      打就打!
You wanna go?        I wanna go!

319
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,299
打倒他      扁他 马丁
Get him off.        Kick his ass, Martin.

320
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,130
这样如何?
Yeah. How do you like that?

321
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,063
抓他头发      我喜欢
Pull his hair!        I love it.

322
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,935
这下可真疼
This hurts so good.

323
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,437
请节哀 女士      多高雅的帽子啊
Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.        What a lovely hat.

324
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:01,670
我爱你的鞋
I love your shoes.

325
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,771
好了好了      继续 继续
It's fine, it's fine.        Go, go.

326
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,542
教训他!
Punish him!

327
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,642
哦 有没搞错
Oh, man.

328
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,288
就这样 我们就是这样做的
Do it. That's how we do it in the hood.

329
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,583
教训他      根本就没有这种动作
Punish him.        That's not even a move.

330
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,123
我赢了 我赢了 每个人都看到了
I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.

331
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,195
你们在搞什么鬼?
What the hell is going on here?

332
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,321
两个好人刚死
Two good men are dead,

333
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,792
你们就为了谁将继承他们的辉煌而打架?
you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?

334
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:23,794
是这么回事?
Is that what's happening?

335
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,626
是 就是这么回事
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.

336
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,062
我告诉你
Let me tell you something.

337
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,671
请节哀 罗琳      请节哀
Sorry for your loss, Lorraine.        Very sorry.

338
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,476
请节哀 罗琳      请节哀 罗琳
Sorry, Lorraine.        Sorry, Lorraine.

339
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,308
你好 我叫吉米
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

340
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,175
太早了吧       你干嘛说这个?
Too soon?        Why'd you say that?

341
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,341
我告诉你 这两个人
I'll tell you something about those guys.

342
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,086
他们之所以是好警察 
They knew that to become a good cop, 

343
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,415
因为他们解决了很多案子 好不?
you had to solve cases. Okay?

344
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,088
好 也许你们可以从卡斯蒂失窃案开始
Okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.

345
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,757
好不好? 所以注意点
Okay? So just watch it.

346
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,931
下次我跟你在图书馆打
Next time, me, you, library.

347
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,159
甭想      来吧 伙计们
Not even close.        Come on, guys. Guys, come on.

348
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,836
你是...      我赢了!
You are...        I'm the winner!

349
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,080
我不需要你帮我强出头 好吗? 
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay? 

350
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,504
我可以自己解决
I could've handled that myself.

351
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,938
别自恋了 我们是搭档么 我别无选择
Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.

352
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,272
走开
Move.

353
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,851
九点十五 祝大家度过美好的一天      闭嘴
9:15, let's have a great day, everybody!        Cut the shit!

354
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,659
早上好
Good morning.

355
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,833
有人开枪了 在西十街509号
We've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.

356
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,038
现场发现大量可卡因
There are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.

357
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,532
别惹麻烦了
Try to stay out of trouble, boys.

358
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,801
你肯定不会去那里的 对吗?
There's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?

359
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,706
想也别想 太忙了
No chance. Too busy.

360
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,633
好吧 女生们 看到了没? 
All right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?

361
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,529
这案子归我们搞定了
 We're about to lock shit down.

362
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,606
没错      你们女生乖乖呆在这里吧
That's right.        You girls stay here and get your type on.

363
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,517
抓住他们 伙计们 能量多多 专注多多
Go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.

364
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:48,645
闭嘴!
Shut up!

365
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,514
艾伦 我可以在走廊跟你说几句吗?
Allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?

366
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:53,023
我...我现在超忙 特里
I...I'm super busy right now, Terry.

367
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,491
不不不 我知道 很快说完
No, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.

368
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,425
是关于我们谈过的建筑工程批准令
It's about the construction permits you were talking about.

369
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,519
非法搭建脚手架?      这才是我们的案子
The scaffolding violations?        This is our thing, yeah.

370
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,723
你查到什么了?
So, what do you got?

371
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,324
这个! 老实点
I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.

372
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,495
你干什么呢?
What are you doing?

373
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,267
走吧 我们去办案
Let's go. We're going to that call.

374
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,231
你干嘛?      闭嘴
What is this?        Shut up.

375
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,374
我们开车 我们要接办这个案子
We're going to the car, and we're going after this case.

376
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,237
你不会向我开枪的      我不会?
You're not gonna shoot me.        I won't?

377
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,413
不会      我向杰特开过枪
No.        I shot Jeter.

378
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,675
那是个意外      是吗?
That was an accident.        Was it?

379
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,273
快走      好吧
Now move.        Okay.

380
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,349
嘿
Hey.

381
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,617
看到没有? 他用枪对着我
Does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.

382
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,520
我被绑架了
I'm being kidnapped.

383
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,686
这里是警署啊 怎么没人感兴趣?
Really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?

384
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,665
发生什么了?      你说发生什么了?
So, then what happened?        What do you think happened?

385
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,482
我醒来 解开脖子上的带子 
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, 

386
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,215
然后上车去了那里
and I got in my car, and I got out of there.

387
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:37,391
一个疯狂的周末 对吗?
Talk about a wild weekend, right?

388
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,768
我本来以为我要杀出去的
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.

389
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,033
你要做什么呢? 受戒礼
What are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.

390
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,275
这是什么?
What the hell is this?

391
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,075
是我的车 普锐斯
It's my car. It's a Prius.

392
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,811
感觉跟在阴道里驾车似的
I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.

393
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,752
霍兹探员和甘博警员在西十街518号
Detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.

394
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,915
别想 马丁和佛西 出来两分钟了
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.

395
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,720
看看谁先到
We'll just see who's there first.

396
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,488
离犯罪现场远点! 你听到没?
You stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?

397
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,220
快 快 快
Go, go, go!

398
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,327
感受到了吗 艾伦? 蛋蛋是不是兴奋了?
You feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?

399
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,498
肚子里面有金属蝴蝶在煽动翅膀?
Big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?

400
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,294
你确定你没有前列腺癌?
Are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?

401
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,129
我知道这个可以让你兴奋起来
I got something to get you going.

402
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,136
我们去搞点破坏!
Let's go do some damage!

403
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,807
不
Nope.

404
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,309
这是什么?
What the hell is that?

405
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,278
小河乐队
LRB. Little River Band.

406
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,452
这音乐太娘们了
This music makes me feel like I'm going shopping for a training bra.

407
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,257
你知道吗? 我们还是别听音乐了 好不好?
You know what? We go with no music, okay?

408
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,451
好      说再见
Fine.        Say bye.

409
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,652
不不不 不要...
No, no, no, don't say bye...

410
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,456
你死定了 霍兹
You just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!

411
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,760
艾伦 你要是不踩加速器我就射你的脚!
Allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!

412
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,265
美国万岁!
America!

413
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,865
艾伦 艾伦 踩刹车!
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!

414
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,935
真的 慢点开 我们快到犯罪现场了
Seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!

415
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:49,799
特里 我来了
Terry, I'm coming in.

416
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,706
你会穿过那个带子的 艾伦!
You're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!

417
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,477
老兄! 有没...
Dude! What...

418
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,811
好多可卡因啊
That's a lot of cocaine.

419
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,979
你踩加速器的时候是不是喊道"美国万岁"?
Did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?

420
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,653
没 没有
Nope. No. No.

421
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,691
我从没像这样
I've never actually put my foot all the way down

422
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,792
一脚踩到底过呢
to the ground with the accelerator like that.

423
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,164
我有点性奋了
It got me slightly aroused.

424
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,297
来了
Here we go.

425
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,833
等不及要到犯罪现场啊 伙计们
Way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.

426
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,346
普锐斯?      是的是的
Prius, huh?        Yep, yep.

427
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,676
省油吧?
Good mileage?

428
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,148
好着呢      对
Outstanding.        Yeah.

429
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,811
这里面是不是有牙科用胶布啊?
Did this come with a dental dam?

430
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,420
没有      没有么?
No.        Get it?

431
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,892
昨晚我在一雪佛兰上找到这玩意
My Suburban shit one of these last night.

432
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,926
我不知道他们在轮子上还放卫生棉呢
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.

433
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,356
我们玩得挺开心 是不?
We've had our fun, huh?

434
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,399
就好像疤面煞星朝你车上打了个喷嚏
Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.

435
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,259
好了 各位!
All right, everybody!

436
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,395
现在请你们后退 我们接手了
I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.

437
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,905
"我在犯罪现场 哈哈哈"
"At the crime scene, LOL."

438
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,702
我上围脖通知一声      谢谢
Good tweet, good tweet.        Yeah, thanks.

439
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,242
美国以资产过剩而出名
America has always been defined by its excess.

440
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,516
大峡谷有多余的运动员契约
The Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.

441
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,018
温蒂汉堡店有多余的培根

442
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:12,254
我自己有18辆兰博基尼
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis

443
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,059
还有辆斯巴鲁敞篷金龟车
and a Subaru station wagon.

444
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,261
就是因为资产过剩我才能奢侈挥霍
And it's because of this excess that I have flourished.

445
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,958
我恳求你们 不要停止赚取利润
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.

446
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,764
过着资产过剩的日子 这才是美国的生活
Live for excess. It's the American way.

447
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,607

Sir David.

450
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,310
大卫 你没回我电话 
David. You're not returning my calls, 

451
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,750
我想让你见见罗杰·韦斯利
so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.

452
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,451

G'day, mate.        Hey.

453
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,157
罗杰和他的团队会监督你 因为我不相信你
Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you,

454
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,884
我知道你会开溜
because I think you're going to take off.

455
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,095
帕米拉 真是荒谬 我哪里也不会去
Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.

456
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,991
大卫 听着 兰道季刊在二十六号发行
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.

457
00:23:57,992 --> 00:23:59,293
如果你那时候不还我钱的话 
You have until then to give me my money. 

458
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:00,803
我就报告我的损失 大卫
I'm not reporting any losses, David.

459
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,816
我盯上了一个新投资者
I have zeroed in on a new investor.

460
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,834
那么 你拿走他们的钱 
Well, then, you get their money,

461
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:05,904
然后让它消失 再付给我们
 make it disappear, and then pay us back.

462
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,333
好好 我会告诉他不必盯紧我
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.

463
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,505
大卫!      好了 宝贝 再见
David!        Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.

464
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,985
她反应过度了 女人嘛 所以你可以走了
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.

465
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,513
我什么都听到了 伙计
Heard everything, mate.

466
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,881
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

467
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,484
猜猜是谁告诉了我让我赚十亿元的秘密?
guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.

468
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,864
这位先生
That man there.

469
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,657
跟上! 跟上!
Go! Go!

470
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,799
靠边      请靠边
Side!        Step aside, please.

471
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,334
你认为我不算警察 是吗?
You don't think I'm a real cop, do you?

472
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,670
不 我面对面跟你说了很多次了
No, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.

473
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,867
我很坦诚地对你说过了
I was really honest about that.

474
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,467
我在处理大案子 好不好?
I'm working on a huge case, all right?

475
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,672
一个名下有七处施工中房屋的地产商
Property owner with seven buildings under construction.

476
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
他连一个脚手架批准令都没有
He hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.

477
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,460
根据百度知道 
Now, according to Ask Jeeves, 

478
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,374
这个嫌疑犯正在广场酒店演讲
this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.

479
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:53,718
这是所谓的大案子? 脚手架批准令?      对啊
That's your big case? Scaffolding permits?        Yeah.

480
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,055
知道吗? 你要和我一起来
Guess what? You're coming with me.

481
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,729
这是把木枪
It's a wooden gun.

482
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,065
很疼啊
That hurts, man!

483
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,679
我总是有小河乐团的歌 
I've always got Little River Band loaded up here. 

484
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,207
我有六盘歌碟呢
I've got six disks in here.

485
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,505
克洛德 在外面见我 在咨询台的后面
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.

486
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:16,747
我要坐新加坡航空
I'm flying Air Singapore.

487
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,543
嘿 道格拉斯 你妻子怎样?      她死了
Hey, Douglas. How's the wife?        She died.

488
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,709
太好了!
Attaboy!

489
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,752
两分钟后到
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.

490
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,715
还有一件很讨厌的事 你总是付零钱
Another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.

491
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,888
你只是嫉妒我的零钱包很好
You're just mad because I have a nice change purse.

492
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,085
你管那么多干啥?
Why do you even care?

493
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,129
我怎么能不管? 你知道吗? 你知道什么更糟吗?
How can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?

494
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,255
你放屁的方式 你连放屁都不像个男人
The way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.

495
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,458
真是荒谬
You're being ridiculous.

496
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,127
听起来像小宝宝吹生日蜡烛
They sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.

497
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,533
什么?      像...
What?        Like a little...

498
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,469
你知道你有什么讨人厌的地方吗?      什么?
You know what bugs me about you?        What?

499
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,104
我敢肯定你从来没投过票
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.

500
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:46,307
不 我有过 体育电台 调频880 本周最佳运动员
No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.

501
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,743
你就像一个穿着皮夹克的小孩 你就是像
You're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.

502
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,905
别挡路 伙计!
Get out of the way, man!

503
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,881
等等 你是大卫·厄森吗?
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

504
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,248
是大卫·厄森先生 我其实也不在意你...
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...

505
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,585
其实 我在赶路 如果你们不介意的话 谢谢
Anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.

506
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,922
对不起 你被捕了 好不好?      什么?
Excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay?        What?

507
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,930
你有权保持沉默 你所说的将被...
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used

508
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,125
后面是什么?       用作悬浮设备
What's the next part?        As a floatation device.

509
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,724
用作悬浮设备
As a floatation device.

510
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,629
你知道吗? 挺搞笑的 我还从来没有抓过人呢
You know what? That's very funny. I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.

511
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,236
真的?      你们动真格的?
Really?        Are you guys for real?

512
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,400
我是不是撞到鬼了?

等等 你们为什么逮捕我?
Wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?

Couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate.        What?

528

你好
Hi.

530

她为什么这样看着我?

531

那是我的车!

I don't get why we can't just call the office 

538
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,336
让他们送辆车来接我们
and have a squad car come pick us up.

539
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,003
不 他们拿走了我们的鞋 我们的枪 还有我们的车
No. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.

540
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,992
我可不能让署里人知道
There's no way that's going out on the radio.

541
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,274
如果我们要合作 
Look, if we're gonna do this together, 

542
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,146
有些问题我们必须要解决 好吗?
there's some issues we need to settle, okay?

543
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,815
我说 你说我下巴不明显 你说我尿尿像个娘们
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.

544
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,084
你觉得我感受如何?
How do you think that makes me feel?

545
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,254
我说 你的那个清单 你考虑得挺周到 很奇怪
I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.

546
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,593
我听到了
I hear you.

547
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,532
我们冰释前嫌 重新开始吧
Let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.

548
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,165
好 重新开始
All right. Fresh start.

549
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,536
也许我们应该叫纺必适兄弟
Maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers,

550
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,403
因为感觉清新舒适
'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.

551
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,740
对吗?
Right?

552
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,245
让我们再重新开始一次 
Let's do another fresh start, 

553
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:07,918
因为我想揍你的脸
'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.

554
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,781
好 重新开始
Fine, fresh start.

555
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,686
最后一次
It's the last one.

556
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,391
我要能够表达清楚再和你交谈 你知道吗
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.

557
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,793
伙计们 大家都听好了!      听好了!
Okay, folks! Everybody, listen up!        Listen up!

558
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,399
光天化日之下发生了一起绑架案

560
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,062
劫持者可能早已埋伏在那 但说不准
Maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.

561
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,576
小矮人 你们的鞋呢 脚都黑乎乎的
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.

562
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,635
谁在乎? 这不是重点
Who cares? It's not important, okay?

563
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,571
霍兹 甘博 头头找你们 情况不妙
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

564

罗杰·韦斯利 私人保镖负责人
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

568

Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch!        Hey, hey, hey!

特里 别激动!

看这是什么
What is this?

574
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,468
艾伦 告诉我 你们表明了吗      没有
Allen, tell me. Did you?        No, we did not.

575
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,086
对不起 先生们 
Sorry, gentlemen. 

576
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,566
我们以为你们当时在绑架厄森先生
We thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.

577
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,270
我们只是按规矩办事
It's only protocol.

578
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:11,208
厄森先生已经同意补上脚手架事宜 
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation.

579

厄森先生没有对你们过度使用武力提起诉讼
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.

583
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,024
谢谢 长官      客气了
Thank you, Captain.        You bet.

584
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,151
你澳大利亚的?
Australian?

585
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,661
特种兵?
Special Forces, right?

凯利·米洛(澳大利亚女歌手)
Kylie Minogue,

589
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,902
女人的股沟
small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...

590
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,372
的确很好看
Beautiful features.

591
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,205
和即将挨揍的男人眼中的恐惧
...and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.

592
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,839
你蛋疼完了没 正事办完了就走
Hey! Shake your dicks. This pissing contest is over.

593
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,247
算了
Come on, man.

594
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,914
看 他们把鞋子还回来了
All right, look, they returned your shoes.

595
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:56,589
你们的武器也回来了 给你 特里
And they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.

596
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,892
艾伦 有人帮你擦了点亚麻油
Allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it,

597
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,832
上面粘了类似深核桃木的污渍
some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.

598
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,496
你该给他们写封感谢信
You might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.

599
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,697
好了
Okay.

600
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,898
你在生我们的气是吧 吉恩
You're mad at us, huh, Gene?

601
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,704
第一 不要叫我吉恩 我是你们的长官
First off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.

602
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,721
你们忘了那个"学聪明点"的演讲吗
Guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?

603
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:16,572
没忘      那么
Sure.        All right.

604
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,275
你们是怎么做的 你们怎么处理的
Well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?

605
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,182
刚好相反 我们不够机灵 吉恩长官
The opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.

606
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,221
叫我"长官"就好了
It's just "Captain. "

607
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,349
就叫"长官" 不是"吉恩长官" 又不是少儿节目
Just "Captain. " It's not "Captain Gene. " I don't have a kiddie show.

608
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,052
"吉恩长官" 听着太不给力了
That sounds creepy, "Captain Gene. "

609
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,521
警方错误抓捕了投资银行家大卫·厄森
Police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.

610
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,533
他是财务分析结果的受害者吗
Was he the victim of financial profiling?

611
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,553
财务分析? 太扯了吧 
Financial profiling? That's crazy. 

612
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,301
明明是他犯了法我们才逮捕他
He broke the law and we arrested him.

613
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,467
那不是他的保镖 他说"别让这些人带走我"
That wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me. "

614
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,277
当你听到马蹄二字 想到的肯定是马 而不是羊吧
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.

615
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,077
为什么不是牛或者驴呢?
What about donkeys or deer?

616
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,117
它们都长蹄子 牛科动物神马的?
They have hooves. What about bovine creatures?

617
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,246
你刚刚是在想 "要有一个新开始"吗?
Were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?

618
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,291
是的      嗯 我看出来了
Yeah.        Yeah. I could see it.

619
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,850
要不去我家吧
Listen, why don't we just go over to my place?

620
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,221
我们好好谈谈这个案子
We'll talk the case down.

621
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,227
吃个简单的晚餐 你可以认识希拉
We can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.

622
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:09,193
我俩只是作为警察在吃饭时候谈公务好不好?
Two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?

623
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,330
不是神马晚餐      好吧
It's not dinner.        Fine.

624
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,232
我先提前道个歉
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

625
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,503
万一我老婆表现得跟环球第一贱人一样
in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.

626
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:20,171
她又老又肥 还得瑟得很
She's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.

627
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,744
我把大卫·厄森的个人资料
Okay, so I put together a little bio, 

628
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,682
和照片整理了一下
complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

629
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,584
我用的Adobe视频软件 我喜欢周末做点编辑的活
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.

630
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,848
我从"盗亦有道"里剪了3分钟的镜头
I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.

632

633
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,987
是一个语音应用 只要99美分
It's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.

His largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.

636
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,001
兰道公司拍了一些不明所以的广告
Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.

637
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,013
是啊 石油 传媒 社保都有涉及 
Yeah, oil, media, health care, 

638
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:53,169
你该知道他们的影响力
you've probably heard their jingle.

639
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,213
兰道公司 我们无处不在
Lendl Global, we're in everything

640
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,147
大卫·厄森经常在思嘉利亚的公司出现
David Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...

641
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,549
是啊      还有Maroon 5的领唱
Yeah.        ...and the lead singer of Maroon 5.

642
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,484
这人可能跟贩毒集团
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels,

643
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,787
黑市器官贩卖和人贩子有联系
black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.

644
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,418
你的结论和我刚才说的有关系吗?
How do you get that from anything I just said?

645
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,989
嘿 汤来了
Hey, guys! Soup's on.

646
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,460
什么意思
What do you mean?

647
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,656
嗨
Hi.

648
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,324
嗨      你肯定是特里
Hi.        You must be Terry.

649
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,632
亲爱的 我不该躲着你的朋友 晚饭太折腾了
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.

650
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,935
你是谁?      我是希拉·甘博 他老婆啊
Who are you?        I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.

651
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,670
说真的 她是谁      他的黄脸婆
Come on, seriously. Who is that?        His old lady.

652
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,235
小甜心 我们在工作呢      明白
Sweetie, it's a workstation.        Got it.

653
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:33,074
你衣不蔽体的样子 太让人分心了
And you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.

654
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,918
我知道你们在工作 对不起
I know you're working. I'm so sorry.

655
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,210
我说真的      真的什么?
Come on, seriously.        Come on, what?

656
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:38,316
她是谁?
Who is that?

657
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,414
她是老...她是我的负担
That's the old...That's the old ball and chain.

658
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,318
啵一个
Get over here.

659
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,022
不 这里不合适      好吧
Not...Not right now.        Okay.

660
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,088
那些都不是考虑的重点
Look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?

661
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,898
你到底说不说她是谁
Come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?

662
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,260
你真的是艾伦的妻子?      我就知道
Are you really Allen's wife?        I know.

663
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,468
他信圣公教 我信天主教 
People are shocked 

664
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,831
别人都不信我们能在一起
because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic,

665
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,942
但事实就是这样
but somehow it works.

666
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,238
你要换身衣服吗?      我换了啊
Are you gonna change?        I already did.

667
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,575
没关系 你看上去漂亮极了
It's no big deal. You look really, really nice.

668
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:10,044
特里 没必要跟她客气 她穿得太风尘了
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.

669
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:11,485
不许你这样说她 艾伦
Don't speak to her like that, Allen.

670
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:13,961
如果我把你这身打扮放到潮人应用里面 
Look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, 

671
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,522
你可能不及格
you'd probably get a D-.

672
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,001
艾伦最喜欢开发应用程序了
Allen and his apps. He loves them.

673
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:21,420
他自己设计了3个应用 有一个...我能说吗?
You know he's designed three of his own? One of them...Can I tell him?

674
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,966
有一个程序 你可以拍任何人的正面
One of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face,

675
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,866
它就会告诉你这个人的后脑勺是什么样的
and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.

676
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,436
叫人人后脑勺      人人后脑勺
Faceback.        Faceback.

677
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,864
已经收到很多夸张的评论了
Got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.

678
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,102
肯定会火的      很吸引眼球
It's gonna hit.        It's gonna catch.

679
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,235
你为什么跟了艾伦?
Why are you with Allen?

680
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,514
不是那个意思 我是说 你俩怎么认识的?
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?

681
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,750
这是一个典型的邂逅故事 特里
It's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.

682
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,513
太乏味了
You're gonna be bored by it.

683
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,762
当时我在尼克斯队跳舞 
I was a dancer for the Knicks 

684
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:46,581
平时是哥伦比亚医院的实习生
while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.

685
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,221
艾伦直肠上起了毒疹 送到急救室
Allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.

686
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,085
是的
Yes.

687
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,822
不用说 我对他一见钟情
Needless to say, I fell for him immediately.

688
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,463
我们在快捷酒店翻云覆雨了3天
We immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn,

689
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,534
老实说 我们连话都没说一句      整整3天
and, to be honest, we didn't speak.        Three days

690
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,165
一次话都没说过
of not communicating once verbally.

691
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,533
不知不觉中
We had actually, without knowing it,

692
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,877
我们学会用眼神调情 用身体语言交流
developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.

693
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,777
特里 我们之间有一种原始兽性的冲动
You know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.

694
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,896
经过3天爱意浓浓的
After those three days of non-verbal communication 

695
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,213
身体交流
and a whole lot of loving,

696
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,756
我的屁股都抽筋了 我不得不去看医生
I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.

697
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,790
就像给屁股发育不良的德国牧羊犬
Similar to operating on a German shepherd

698
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,093
做手术一样      疼死我了
when they have hip dysplasia.        Very painful.

699
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,963
特别有意思 像那部电影的情节一样 
It's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie,

700
00:34:33,964 --> 00:34:35,464
我总是忘记名字
 always forget the name of it.

701
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,733
梅格·瑞恩演的      就是
With Meg Ryan.        Yes.

702
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,534
我不记得梅格·瑞恩在什么电影里
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan 

703
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,778
邂逅过屁股长疮的男人
meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.

704
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,277
我想想 我想想      好
I'll think of it. I'll think of it.        Okay.

705
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,075
特里 你呢 有女朋友没
So, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?

706
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,139
以前有
I did, yeah.

707
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,718
我们本要结婚的 但她后来退缩了 事情比较复杂
We were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.

708
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,161
特里朝德里克·杰特开了一枪
Terry shot Derek Jeter.

709
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,755
闭嘴 艾伦 这是哪辈子的事了
Shut up, Allen. This was before.

710
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:52,584
没关系
That's okay.

711
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,625
电影的名字是 "电子情书"
She's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.

712
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,659
对对对 亲爱的
That's it! Honey!

713
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,869
汤姆·汉克斯演的?      是的
With Tom Hanks?        Right.

714
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,987
还有梅格·瑞恩      梅格·瑞恩
And Meg Ryan.        Meg Ryan.

715
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,155
他屁股上可没长疮
He didn't have poison ivy up his ass.

716
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,561
他长了的      他真的长了的
Yes, he did.        Yes, he did. Yeah.

717
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,894
就长那儿的
Way up there.

718
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,995
特里 很荣幸你能来我家度过这样一个...
Well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...

719
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,991
一个温馨美好的夜晚 谢谢
What a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.

720
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:10,599
很高兴认识你 特里
It was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.

721
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,495
是我的荣幸啊 谢谢
It was my pleasure. Thank you.

722
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:16,003
记住 我只有一个请求 不要让他受伤 特里
And remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.

723
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,480
我每天上班前她都要这么说      必须的
She tells me that every day before I leave.        Yep, I do.

724
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,649
我下楼给他做鲜草莓汁
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries,

725
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,516
我会说 "小宝贝 不管你今天多忙"
and I say, " Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today,

726
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,919
"都不要受伤"
"you just don't get hurt. "

727
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,521
是啊 每天早上都说
Yeah. Every morning.

728
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,550
接着我给他看我的咪咪 我说 "它们在等你"
And then I show him my breasts, and I say, " These are waiting for you

729
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:32,455
"等你回家"      就是
"when you get back home. "        Right.

730
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,431
特里 我的胸部不是他见过最大的
You know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen,

731
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,934
但是它们很神气      绝不是最大的
but, man, are they perky.        Not by a long shot.

732
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,664
它们很坚挺 它们属于你      你很漂亮
And they are firm, and they are yours.        You're a nice lady.

733
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,967
谢谢你能来
Thank you for coming.

734
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,000
霍兹和甘博探员? 霍兹和甘博探员? 完毕
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.

735
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,170
霍兹在
Go for Hoitz.

736
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,804
我们找到你的普锐斯车了      太好了
We found your red Prius.        Great.

737
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,975
它正打算为拉尔夫·内德(活动家)投票
It was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.

738
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
得了吧      小宝贝 听着
Come on.        Okay, sugar balls, listen up.

739
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,650
车上肯定有指纹
There's gonna be fingerprints on that car.

740
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,353
明天我们去提取指纹 放进系统检索
Tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.

741
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,354
一旦得到匹配结果 
And if we get a hit, 

742
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,821
案子进展肯定势如破竹
this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.

743
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,226
明天早上你起床后就做一件事 带上胆子
You do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.

744
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,387
好的      谢谢 希拉
Okay.        Thank you, Sheila.

745
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,555
他会带上胆子的
He'll bring it.

746
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,292
晚安      晚安
Good night!        Good night.

747
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,698
谢谢你 希拉
Thank you, Sheila.

748
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,061
再见 特里      再见 希拉 我不会忘记今晚
Bye, Terry!        Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.

749
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,969
再见 特里      行了 艾伦 回去吧
Bye, Terry!        All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.

750
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,132
再见 希拉
Bye, Sheila!

751
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,698
晚安      再见...再见 特里
Night!        See you...See you, Terry!

752
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,667
再见 希拉
Bye, Sheila.

753
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,243
不知道他听见没 再见 特里
I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!

754
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,909
再见 希拉
Bye, Sheila!

755
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,759
车在这了 他们把它扔在一座天桥下
Well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.

756
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,522
有什么发现吗
You find anything?

757
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,360
很多发现
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

758
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,400
有体液啊毛发啊什么的
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

759
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,907
我们相信有一帮无家可归的老流浪汉
we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes 

760
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,028
在车里开过狂欢晚会
had an orgy in the car.

761
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:48,868
天哪      节哀吧
Oh, God.        Yeah.

762
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,771
你知道他们把这种狂欢叫什么吗
You know what that's called when they do that in there?

763
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,342
流动厨房
That's called a soup kitchen.

764
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,002
脏乱差啊
It's pretty rough stuff.

765
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,570
不多久 一只母浣熊到车里
Not long after that, a mama raccoon came along

766
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,081
生了仔
and gave birth on the floor.

767
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,999
胎盘都喷到后窗上了
Placenta blew out all over the back window there.

768
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,281
后来 有个小鬼到车里的驾驶座上
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along

769
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,650
拉了一坨有技术含量的屎
takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.

770
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,722
我猜他知道你们是警察
I think he knew you guys were cops,

771
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,996
因为我把他的便便叫做蓄意报复屎
because this is what I would call a spite shit.

772
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,498
光通过毛发和体液样本
You were able to determine all of that

773
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,397
你就能推测处这么多情节?      当然了
from the hair and fluid samples?        Oh, yeah.

774
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,717
指纹呢 你发现指纹了吗
What about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?

775
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,332
没有 什么指纹都没有      找到一部手机
Nope, couldn't get a one.        Found a cell phone.

776
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,434
是我的
Yeah, that's mine.

777
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,307
有没有挣扎或搏斗的痕迹?
Any signs of a struggle or spent shells?

778
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,928
没有 来狂欢的都是自愿的
No. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.

779
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,973
其实他们还给你留了个便条
In fact, they even left you a note here.

780
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:36,046
"谢谢你的小帐篷 爱你 潇洒哥和兄弟们"
"Thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys. "

781
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:36,910
这是在车里找到的
Here's something we found.

782
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,582
我们找到一打没刮过的彩票
We found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.

783
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,817
没有指纹神马的 你看看
No fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.

784
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,413
太遗憾了 
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.

785
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:46,594
我有台普锐斯 现在成破铜烂铁了
 I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.

786
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,133
这是我第一辆新车 我以前从没买过新车
It's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.

787
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,964
还发现一头鹿的阴道
Found a deer vagina.

788
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,338
什么?      开始还以为是人的嘴唇
What?        Thought it was human lips at first.

789
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,707
我们又仔细看了看 绝对是鹿的阴道
Then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.

790
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,358
连"再来一张"都没有
Not even a free ticket.

791
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,274
我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

792
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,741
指纹没提取到 还拿了一堆没用的彩票
We got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.

793
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:09,652
你看 我们被拽下车后有人打了2分钟的电话
Look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.

794
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,688
用你手机打的?      秘密拨打的
They used your phone?        They ghost dialed.

795
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,916
可能有人在电话那头监听
Someone probably sat on it.

796
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,192
厄森被抓时 
It could have recorded some of 

797
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:15,855
他们的部分谈话可能被录下来了
their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.

798
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,691
我们必须调查谁接到了那个电话
We gotta hear the other side of that call.

799
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,727
不 没必要
Nope, no, it's nothing.

800
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,228
没必要?      没必要
Nothing?        It's nothing.

801
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:22,232
这是唯一的线索      真没必要
It's the only lead we have.        It's nothing.

802
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,532
你这么激动干嘛
Why did you just get super jumpy?

803
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,727
怎么了?
What?

804
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,771
是我前女友
It's an ex-girlfriend, okay?

805
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,601
怎么了 你俩怎么回事
What's the matter? What happened with you guys?

806
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,538
没什么 哥不想跟她有半毛钱的关系
She was just a bit of a handful, that's it.

807
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,771
艾伦 这是我们唯一的线索
Allen, it's the only lead we have.

808
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:40,914
要么查下去 要么撒手不管
We either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.

809
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,385
好吧 去找她
Fine. Let's go see her.

810
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,562
你好啊 克丽斯汀妮斯
Hello, Christinith.

811
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,227
你好 艾伦
Hello, Allen.

812
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,403
这是我同事 特里      你好 特莱
That's my partner, Terry.        Hi, Telly.

813
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,605
见鬼了我      别紧张 放松
Holy shit. Dude.        Just relax, relax.

814
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:13,382
我在高塔音像店等了你4个小时
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.

815
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,086
那是13年前的事了
That was 13 years ago.

816
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,518
阿诺·旁姆来啦 阿诺·旁姆来啦 
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.

817
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,533
谁要喝伦家调制的饮料?
 Who wants some Arnie Palmies?

818
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,021
亲爱的 这杯有伏特加加哦 这杯
Sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.

819
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,294
放桌上就好了       好滴
Hal, just place it down, please.        All righty.

820
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,363
放好了啦
Okay.

821
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:41,638
我跟你合体的姿势 都没有跟别人尝试过
I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.

822
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,009
真的没有
No.

823
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,489
克丽斯汀妮斯 你老公在 别说了
Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.

824
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,656
没事 他全知道
Oh, no, he knows all of this.

825
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,474
你太幸运了      就是
You're a lucky dog.        It's true.

826
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,387
克丽斯汀 你家很漂亮
Christine, this is a lovely house.

827
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,817
我叫克丽斯汀妮斯 你是傻子还是聋子?
It's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?

828
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:59,721
克丽斯汀妮斯 蠢猪!
Christinith, you idiot!

829
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:04,352
到我们家 就得把我老婆的名字叫对了!
You come to our house, you get my wife's name right!

830
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,833
什么?      克丽斯汀妮斯!
What?        Christinith!

831
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,667
你们如此好客 我们表示很感动
Look, we really appreciate the hospitality.

832
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,167
我们想听听你的电话录音
We'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.

833
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,500
它很有可能关系到一起绑架案
We believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.

834
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:21,000
好啊 我们去厨房吧 我把它放给你听
Okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it

835
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,511
别人都不许来
and everyone else stay here.

836
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,350
没问题 亲爱的      来吧
Okay, sweetie.        Come on.

837
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,594
电话在那      太好了 谢谢...
There's my phone.        Great, thank you for...

838
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,737
我恨你 你这贱人!
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

839
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,905
你力气真大      我比你想象的力气更大!
You're so strong.        I'm stronger than you will ever know!

840
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,000
我恨你 我恨你
I hate you! I hate you!

841
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,603
你太可爱了 看你这张脸蛋 看你这张脸蛋
You're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.

842
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,717
说 "我耐你" 快说 "我耐你 克斯妮斯"
You go, "I wuv you. " Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith. "

843
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:04,861
你可能觉得因为我长了络腮胡 所以汗毛很重
You probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.

844
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,930
其实我没有啦
But I'm not.

845
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,799
我刮过的
Shaved.

846
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,030
艾伦!      他没事的
Allen!        He's fine.

847
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,197
问你一个问题
Question.

848
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,399
你想当哪种动物
What would you rather be,

849
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,243
熊还是狗?
a bear or a dog?

850
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,346
无所谓      我想当
I don't care.        I wanna be

851
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,275
熊狗 一半狗 一半熊那种
a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

852
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,318
因为熊狗既可以当宠物住在家里
'Cause that way, I could live in the house

853
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,957
又能够去小树林里拉屎
but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.

854
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,586
艾伦!
Allen!

855
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,354
艾伦! 艾伦!
Allen! Allen!

856
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,663
这是警方证据 特里 跑啊!      嘿!
This is police evidence. Terry! Let's go!        Hey!

857
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,260
你得回来跟我老婆合体!
You get back here and you make love to my wife!

858
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,895
艾伦! 艾伦!
Allen! Allen!

859
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,267
我想不通 我实在想不通
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.

860
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,607
克丽斯汀妮斯身材超辣的
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.

861
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,340
你老婆也让人喷鼻血
Your wife is crazy hot.

862
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,347
即使旁边有个巴西人妖 
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, 

863
00:41:59,348 --> 00:42:00,611
她还是暗示你"上我吧"
she threw you a "Do me" vibe.

864
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
你怎么那么吸引辣妹?
What is it with you and hot ladies?

865
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,936
首先 我老婆是可爱 不是火辣
First off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.

866
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:09,750
你脑子装浆糊了吗 你老婆那么性感
Dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.

867
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,626
你到底听不听电话录音?      听吧
You wanna listen to this message or not?        Yeah, whatever.

868
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:13,896
你要去办一件事
You have one job, mate.

869
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,289
找个可怜虫和你共同投资
Find a sucker to invest with you

870
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,101
这样你就能把钱还给我老板了
so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.

871
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,330
我不在乎你找谁
And I don't care who.

872
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,735
对了 我想起来我这有个可怜虫
Right. I actually think I found a sucker...

873
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,273
他让厄森...投资320亿美元
He's talking to Ershon. ...to invest $32 billion.

874
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,263
谁傻逼兮兮地拿320亿让人抢啊
Who's got $32 billion to rob?

875
00:42:26,264 --> 00:42:28,273
只要我拿到钱 我会纂改数据
Once I get the money, I'll falsify the records

876
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,176
告诉他们损失惨重 再给你的员工付工资
to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.

877
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,911
既然你跟着我 我现在就去公园大道2300号
Now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,

878
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,577
接着...
and after that...

879
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,450
我就说他们不是保安
I told you it wasn't a security team.

880
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,279
他被绑架了      明显的事 但为什么...晕...
He was being abducted.        Obviously, but what kind...Holy...

881
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,550
进了我家门 必须跟我老婆合体!
Nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!

882
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,787
是他吗?      是啊
Is that him?        Yeah!

883
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,692
他们从哪儿冒出来的?
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!

884
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,595
见鬼!      他们追了我们20英里
Holy shit!        They chased us 20 miles.

885
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,094
回来 给我回来!      艾伦!
You come back here! You get back here!        Allen!

886
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,237
公园大道2300号 是彩票公司
2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.

887
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,675
该死 就是我们找到的那些彩票
Holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.

888
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:08,183
厄森通过发售彩票来弥补他的损失
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.

889
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:11,205
320亿 一个州的收入啊
$32 billion. That's the state's money.

890
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,083
我们怎么跟毛奇交代? 有人亏钱了
Well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.

891
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,517
我们只有一条粗略的语音信息和一个地址 
We have a scratchy cell phone message and an address. 

892
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,700
半个案子都不算
It's still half a case.

893
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,687
肯定有书面记录 
There's gotta be some sort of paper trail. 

894
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:20,424
要是能找到 我们可以跟踪
If we can find that, if we can track it,

895
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,513
然后告诉毛奇这事
then we can go to Mauch.

896
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,759
我调查了厄森的会计公司
So, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm,

897
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,566
发现一些有意思的事
and I found some pretty interesting stuff.

898
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,802
G-D会计公司...
It turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...

899
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,938
等等 到我了
Hold on, I'm up.

900
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,306
我把爱献给了厄琳
I gave my love to Erin

901
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,947
她答应等我
She promised to be true

902
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:48,481
当我从战场上回来
I went to war to come back

903
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,528
已经有5个英国士兵
And find five British soldiers

904
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,827
和她有过恋情
Had their way with her

905
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,369
他们互相吸引
It was consensual

906
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,163
唱完了?
Done?

907
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,307
G-D会计公司在新泽西州的费尔良
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

908
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,369
只有一个客户 大卫·厄森
has only one client, David Ershon.

909
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,004
这种手法对他来说太老套了
Pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.

910
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,811
貌似我们该去新泽西拜访一下会计公司
Looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.

911
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,648
累死人的一天
That's a shitty day.

912
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,949
他们的父亲都被吊死
And all their fathers were hanged

913
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,484
所有的孩子哭红了双眼
And the children all got pink eye

914
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:35,802
哈利波特全集丢进火坑
While their Harry Potter books were burned

915
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,758
唱这些歌很有意思吗? 太压抑了
Do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.

916
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:44,980
有意思啊 它们包含了深刻的历史
I do. They're full of rich history.

917
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,674
靠 我迟到了 该去见我女朋友的
Damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.

918
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:50,652
你们不是分手了吗
I thought you said you guys split up.

919
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,246
我俩之间只谈工作行吗
Let's just keep our thing about work, okay?

920
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,915
好的 再见 兄弟
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

921
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,016
别碰我
Hey, get off me, man.

922
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,342
你在干嘛呢
What the hell are you doing?

923
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,389
跳舞啊 特里 你在这干嘛
I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?

924
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,246
我爱你 弗朗辛
I love you, Francine.

925
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,208
要是你没和我分手 
If you were with me, 

926
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:26,785
你也不用为了钱在这跳脱衣舞啊
you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!

927
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,718
这是芭蕾排练室 特里 这里的钢管是水平的
This is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.

928
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,854
他很爱你 弗朗辛
He loves you very much, Francine.

929
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,749
他是谁      你在这干嘛 艾伦?
Who is this guy?        What are you doing here, Allen?

930
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,094
我们是同事嘛
It's the code. I'm your partner.

931
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,362
我来挺我的朋友兼工作伙伴的
I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.

932
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,928
弗朗辛 这个人在骚扰你吗
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

933
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,997
他是谁 你的新男友吗? 太好了 你有新男友了
Who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.

934
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:49,412
他是我的舞伴 特里
He is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?

935
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,277
我知道这对你来说是个惊喜
I know that this is a big surprise,

936
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,444
但是除了当警察 世界上还有很多别的事可做
but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?

937
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,752
如果你没别的事的话 我要跳舞了
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.

938
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,918
怎么 你觉得我不会这玩意么
What, you don't think I can do this shit?

939
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,665
太出乎意料了 特里
That was surprisingly good, Terry.

940
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,738
我爱你 弗朗辛      你不懂什么叫爱
I love you, Francine.        You don't know what love is.

941
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,509
他很爱你 弗朗辛!
He loves you very much, Francine!

942
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,530
他说话我听得见 谢谢你
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.

943
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,677
你看你怎么对我的吗? 你森森地割裂了我的心
You know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.

944
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,277
别瞪我 死人!
And don't eyeball me, man!

945
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,354
你就跟这么磕碜的瘾君子眉来眼去吗?
You're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?

946
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,113
特里!
Terry!

947
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,084
他对你的行为很失望!
He does not approve of your behavior!

948
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:35,959
你可以走了
Can you please go?

949
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,774
你也是 站门口那神经病!
And you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?

950
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,660
走吧 艾伦
Let's go, Allen.

951
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,694
我们今天都跳了一场自己的芭蕾
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.

952
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,834
饱含情绪的芭蕾
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

953
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,864
你是来煽风点火的
You're kind of making things worse.

954
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,317
没事吧?      没事
You okay?        Yeah, I'm fine.

955
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,246
我不知道你居然会跳舞
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.

956
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,660
我小时候学的舞步 去取笑别人
We used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids,

957
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,092
给他们看这些舞步是多可笑
show them how queer they were, okay?

958
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,023
你学跳舞是为了讽刺别人啊?      我想是的
You learned to dance like that sarcastically?        Yeah, I guess.

959
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,661
别掺和我的私人生活行吗? 小孩的心思你不懂
Stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.

960
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,900
专注这个案子吧 明天新泽西见
Stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.

961
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,899
好吧 特里
All right, Terry.

962
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,038
我觉得很释然 不知道你怎么想
Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.

963
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,936
看这个 6个月以前的文章
Here, check this out. Article from six months ago.

964
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,597
讲了彩票业
Talking about how the lottery is looking

965
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,438
投资300亿美元的行为过于激进
to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.

966
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,097
所以他在贩毒?
So he's dealing drugs?

967
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,112
跟贩毒没关系 我们不是在拍"迈阿密风云"
No, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.

968
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,050
对不起 我...
Look, I'm sorry. I just...

969
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:16,454
我今天情绪不好 希拉和我昨晚闹矛盾了
I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.

970
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,359
怎么了
What happened?

971
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,062
她想去进修机构学一门课
She was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?

972
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,634
叫"口交的艺术"
Called "The Art of Oral Sex"?

973
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,599
我们目前没有足够的预算
You know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.

974
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,174
她总是只考虑自己
It's always about her.

975
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,543
是啊...是不应该
Yeah, that's...That's messed up.

976
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,769
我给你准备了一份礼物
Hey, I got you a gift.

977
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,577
我看见它就想到你了 
I just saw something, and I thought of you, 

978
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,590
我不想搞得很奇怪
and so, I don't want it to be weird.

979
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:42,585
只是表示友好哈
I just wanted to be nice.

980
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,683
当然很奇怪了
Of course it's weird.

981
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,585
一个成年男人给另一个男人送礼物
It's a grown man giving another man a present.

982
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,589
给你 打开看看
There you go. Open it up.

983
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,093
没事的 不用谢
It's okay, you're welcome.

984
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,297
我喜欢送人礼物
I like to do things like that.

985
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:55,560
看它说的什么
Take a look what it says.

986
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,700
FBI
FBI.

987
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,700
女性身体检查官
Female Body Inspector.

988
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,110
我们都属于执法系统
You know, because we're both in law enforcement.

989
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,769
都喜欢女人
We both like women.

990
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,872
但我的幽默感很奇怪 病态的幽默
But I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.

991
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,377
我不能看它 看一眼就要笑死过去
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.

992
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,749
我也是
Me, too.

993
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,320
做得好 很有礼貌
Real nice. You know, it's all class.

994
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,961
好      别再来这套了
Okay.        Don't do that shit any more.

995
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,429
相信我 不会了
Yeah, believe me, I won't.

996
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,364
你明白它为什么搞笑吗
Do you understand what's so funny about it, though?

997
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,831
因为它写着FBI 字母一样 标志也一样
'Cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.

998
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:39,439
第一眼看上去 它只是一个写了"FBI"的马克杯
And at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI."

999
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,674
但你再看一眼 "女性身体检查官"?
But then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?

1000
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,109
太扯了 这都想得出来...
Get out of town. This is outrageous...

1001
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,279
闭嘴!
Shut up!

1002
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,027
总有一天 我会越过你的怒火
I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours

1003
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,192
直达你的内心
one of these days,

1004
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,428
那将是我的光荣
and it's gonna be glorious.

1005
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,005
我们是不是该告诉毛奇 我们在查这个地方?
Shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?

1006
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:14,291
为什么? 我们只是调查一下
For what? We're just going to check it out.

1007
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:15,876
我知道 但这是程序嘛
I know, but it's procedure.

1008
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,074
特里表示沉默
Terry answers to no one.

1009
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,911
我该干嘛干嘛
I do what I do.

1010
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,821
哪家会计公司会在周二上午11点关门啊?
What accounting firm is closed at 11:00 a. m. On a Tuesday?

1011
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:26,801
这就是个空壳
This is a shithole.

1012
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,489
我喜欢爆破
I love bombs.

1013
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,762
我听不见了! 我听不见了!
I can't hear! I can't hear!

1014
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,228
我手上起水泡了!
There's blood blisters on my hands!

1015
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,397
额滴神呐!
Oh, my God!

1016
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,771
为什么电影里的人没有被炸飞
How do they walk away in movies without flinching

1017
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,571
还能安然无恙地路过呢?
when it explodes behind them?

1018
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:51,119
不可能! 电影神马的都是浮云!
There's no way! I call bullshit on that!

1019
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,581
当他们乘坐千年鹰号飞离死亡之星时
When they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star,

1020
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,924
死亡之星就发生了大爆炸 全是鬼扯!
and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!

1021
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:02,020
不许你说星球大战的坏话! 演的都是真的!
Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!

1022
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,093
我要做个核磁共振
I need an MRI.

1023
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,461
我要做核磁共振! 我软组织受伤了
I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.

1024
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,617
我的软组织绝对受伤了
There's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.

1025
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:12,300
消停一下吧
Please stop.

1026
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:15,031
我想蜷缩在女人的怀里喝奶!
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!

1027
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,874
消防部认为是天然气泄漏 
Fire Department said it was a gas leak, 

1028
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,029
但不可能 这是定时炸弹
but no way. That was timed.

1029
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,523
他们不想杀我们 他们要我们害怕
They didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.

1030
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:26,939
是啊 他们成功了
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?

1031
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,645
我累了 行了吧?
I'm tired of this. All right?

1032
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,279
我不想再经历爆炸或被人用枪指着头了
I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.

1033
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,482
我想坐回办公桌跟前
I wanna go back to my desk.

1034
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,050
你知道吗? 生活有时就是这样震耳欲聋
Guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.

1035
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,729
你不能一辈子都躲在办公桌后面
You can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.

1036
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,461
为什么不可以? 我已经躲了很多年了
You know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?

1037
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,468
办公室里就没有爆炸
There's no explosions at my desk.

1038
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:51,473
家里有豪宅娇妻 但没有爆炸
There's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.

1039
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,539
你在害怕什么?
What are you afraid of, man?

1040
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,174
我是你的搭档 你可以告诉我 你在害怕什么?
I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?

1041
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,284
我那时大二
I was a sophomore in college.

1042
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,750
我读的大学决定增加学费
The university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.

1043
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,518
我一个同学 布兰达 
A classmate of mine, Brenda, 

1044
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,731
为了筹钱交学费
in an effort to raise money and stay in school,

1045
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,768
想到了一个好点子
came up with a nifty plan

1046
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,603
就是跟男生约会 问他们要钱
where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.

1047
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,063
我随时都有约会
I go on dates all the time,

1048
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,267
跟不同的男人
with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.

1049
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,508
我需要人帮忙
And I kind of need somebody to help me out, 

1050
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:29,211
就是找个搭档帮我牵线救场
like, you know, my partner in crime.

1051
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,543
嗯 我可以安排
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

1052
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,207
对对 我也是这么想的
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1053
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,808
提供接送服务什么的      对对
Provide transportation services.        Yeah, yeah.

1054
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,246
聊天很愉快      感谢你来找我
It's gonna be a good time.        Thanks so much for asking me.

1055
00:52:38,247 --> 00:52:40,589
她说她要我帮忙 确保约会顺利
She said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay

1056
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,115
男人付给她钱 她答应给我分红
and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.

1057
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,492
天啊 你是个皮条客      什么? 晕 不是
Oh, my God. You were a pimp.        What? God, no.

1058
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,656
我只是想帮朋友
No, I was just trying to help a friend.

1059
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,326
我们开始挣了很多钱
We started making a lot of money.

1060
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,237
没想到的是 布兰达的朋友们
And wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends

1061
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,002
也想加入这个活动
decided they wanted to be a part of it.

1062
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,771
没过多久 我保护的女孩子有14个之多
Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting

1063
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,472
她们都给我分红
while they gave me money.

1064
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,394
你养了一窝妓女
That's called a stable of whores.

1065
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,011
我们决定给我换个名字 
We decided I shouldn't use my real name.

1066
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,954
于是我起了"盖特"这名
 So we came up with the name "Gator. "

1067
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,655
你绝对是皮条客
I'm telling you, you were a pimp.

1068
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,350
不是! 你有没有听我说话?
No! Are you even listening to the story?

1069
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,304
总之 有一天我醒来 看着镜子里的自己
Anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror,

1070
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,594
发现我讨厌自己这副面孔
and I don't like what I see.

1071
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,860
我已经无法掌控局面 而我都没有意识到
I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.

1072
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,503
在皮条客那行没有良心可言
You can't have a conscience in the pimp game.

1073
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,003
一天晚上 我最喜欢的两个女孩
One night, two of my favorite girls,

1074
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,304
凯蒂和卓琳说 "加入我们吧"
Candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in,"

1075
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,676
接着她们把我丢在了急救室
and they dropped me off at the emergency room.

1076
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,961
我就在那遇见了希拉 那时我很狼狈
That's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.

1077
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:42,227
我给自己和她许诺 
I made a promise to myself and to her 

1078
00:53:42,228 --> 00:53:44,273
再也不能让人生失控
that I would never get out of control again.

1079
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,187
所以 我一毕业
So, as soon as I graduated from college,

1080
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,191
就做了警察局的会计
I became an accountant for the police department.

1081
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,523
我能想到的最稳定的工作
The most stable job I could think of.

1082
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,531
管社会治安的会计
An accountant for law and order.

1083
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,897
我再也不想体验被生活操纵的日子了
I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.

1084
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,703
别担心 哥支持你
Don't worry. I got your back.

1085
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,510
我们去找厄森 看他什么反应吧
Now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.

1086
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:13,078
我不想再蹑手蹑脚地查案了      好
I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around.        Okay.

1087
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,446
要么从木板上走过去 要么脱裤子
You can either walk the plank or take your panties off.

1088
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:17,846
你选一个
The choice is yours.

1089
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,898
我选脱裤子
I want to take my panties off.

1090
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,787
真聪明
You've made a wise choice, you have.

1091
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:24,161
厄森先生 甘博探员
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble 

1092
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:26,690
和枪击德里克·杰特的那人来了
and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.

1093
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,859
请进 先生们
Gentlemen, please.

1094
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,231
记得我们吗 帅哥?      当然记得 请坐
Remember us, hotshot?        Of course I do. Please, sit.

1095
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,996
看她爆炸了
There she blows.

1096
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,671
两杯伏特加 不要青柠 只要酸黄瓜
Two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.

1097
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,871
猜我们从哪儿来? 你的会计公司爆炸了
Guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.

1098
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,443
是啊 该死的天然气泄漏
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1099
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,531
天然气泄漏? 
Gas leak? 

1100
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:49,621
你口臭泄漏还差不多
The only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.

1101
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:54,580
我只能感谢上天没人受重伤
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.

1102
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,587
我憎恨死亡
I absolutely abhor death.

1103
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,085
得了吧 耶稣 别装了
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?

1104
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,388
我们知道抓你的人并非你的保安
We know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.

1105
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:05,865
也知道你想引大鱼上钩来弥补损失
And we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.

1106
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:08,220
你再胡说 我就打得你鼻青脸肿
You talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.

1107
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:11,035
这杯水太好喝了 特里
God, this water is good. Terry,

1108
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:10,573
你喝了吗?      闭嘴 艾伦
have you tried the water?        Shut up Allen

1109
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,765
我向你保证 我完全不知道你们在说什么
I assure you I have no idea what you're talking about

1110
00:55:15,870 --> 00:55:18,417
我知道脚手架这摊子事
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up 

1111
00:55:18,418 --> 00:55:19,773
有一点混乱
with the whole scaffolding business.

1112
00:55:19,874 --> 00:55:25,278
这块黄瓜让这甁水更加...
The cucumber accents the water in such a way that...

1113
00:55:26,447 --> 00:55:28,165
为了表示我的歉意 
Perhaps by way of apology, 

1114
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:31,181
我可以送你们尼克斯队比赛的前排座位
I can offer you my personal courtside seats

1115
00:55:31,252 --> 00:55:35,416
还有大使俱乐部的通行证
for the Knicks game, with access to the Ambassador Club.

1116
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:40,120
加油 尼克斯队 加油 
Come on, Knicks! Come on! 

1117
00:55:40,224 --> 00:55:42,924
我对尼克斯的狂热 是很有感染力的
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!

1118
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:48,292
嘿 我觉得坐到这里很奇怪 感觉像是贿赂
Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.

1119
00:55:48,402 --> 00:55:52,930
是贿赂 狗仔子 我看到前场票 就没多想了
It is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.

1120
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,302
走吧
come on

1121
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,474
打给我
call me

1122
00:55:57,945 --> 00:55:59,742
抱歉      你耍得什么把戏
Excuse me.        That was a trick.

1123
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,213
别再玩了
No more

1124
00:56:01,282 --> 00:56:06,652
先生们 你们要选 妈妈咪呀还是泽西男孩
Gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.

1125
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:13,051
太棒了 难以置信
Fantastic! You're so unbelievable!

1126
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:19,465
该死 他又耍了这招
Damn it. He did it again.

1127
00:56:20,434 --> 00:56:22,732
不好意思      不要再给票了
Excuse me.        No more tickets.

1128
00:56:22,803 --> 00:56:24,737
厄森先生 我试过让他们在休息室等
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.

1129
00:56:24,805 --> 00:56:28,070
没事 苏珊 两杯冰川矿泉水 加地中海青柠
That's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.

1130
00:56:28,142 --> 00:56:30,007
不 不 不用 不用水 我们不是来喝水的
No, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.

1131
00:56:30,111 --> 00:56:32,136
不 我倒是很想要杯水的
No, I was very much looking forward to having a water.

1132
00:56:32,246 --> 00:56:36,683
泽西男孩很棒吧?      不是棒 太美妙绝伦了
How great is Jersey Boys?        It's not great. It's fantastic!

1133
00:56:36,784 --> 00:56:40,117
你绝对贱卖了 那壮丽的场景 服装
You totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.

1134
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,815
哇哦 正翻了的音乐剧
Wow, what a musical.

1135
00:56:41,923 --> 00:56:43,788
嘿 过来
Hey. Get over here.

1136
00:56:44,926 --> 00:56:46,086
你怎么回事?      什么?
What's wrong with you?        What?

1137
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,650
我们来这里不是聊这个的
That's not what we're here for.

1138
00:56:48,596 --> 00:56:50,655
我们来唱白脸 黑脸 好吗?
We're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?

1139
00:56:50,965 --> 00:56:53,991
既然是书中记载中最古老的方法 肯定会有用
It's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.

1140
00:56:54,101 --> 00:56:55,932
我来硬的 然后你再参与进来
I come strong, then you come in.

1141
00:56:55,933 --> 00:56:56,795
明白吗?      明白
You got it?        Yeah.

1142
00:56:56,801 --> 00:56:59,333
我来硬的 然后你参与进来      对 明白
I come strong, then you come in.        Right. Got it.

1143
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:01,340
你给我听着 你个杂种
Now you listen to me, you piece of shit.

1144
00:57:01,609 --> 00:57:04,169
就我们俩的事 我要把你撕个粉碎
It's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!

1145
00:57:04,278 --> 00:57:06,176
你是怎么掩盖你的损失的? 
How did you cover your losses up? 

1146
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:08,477
你为哪个毒品巨头卖命?
What drug cartel are you working with now?

1147
00:57:08,549 --> 00:57:12,485
好吧 我要和你说 你比较理智      不 看着我
Okay, I'll talk to you, you're reasonable!        No, no, look at me!

1148
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:15,021
你想和我说? 你想和我说?
You wanna talk to me? You wanna talk to me?

1149

Allen, what are you doing? What are you doing? Allen!

我让你吃屎
I'm gonna make you eat a plate of human shit!

1151
00:57:22,363 --> 00:57:24,160
给我滚开
Get away from me!

1152

他在哪?
Where is he?

1153
00:57:32,373 --> 00:57:34,967
听着 我真的很抱歉
Look, I'm really sorry about that.

1154
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,335
我看到你那么有攻击性 我想
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought,

1155
00:57:38,412 --> 00:57:40,954
"哇 我要做得更狠才行 
"Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that, 

1156
00:57:40,955 --> 00:57:42,142
"因为我们在唱黑脸 黑脸"
"since we're doing bad cop, bad cop. "

1157
00:57:42,149 --> 00:57:43,579
什么? 不是 我是说
What? No, I said, 

1158
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:47,213
"白脸 黑脸" 我是黑脸 你是白脸
"Good cop, bad cop. " I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.

1159
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:48,849
好吧 事情都这样了 
Okay, then there it is. 

1160
00:57:48,850 --> 00:57:51,925
算了 我以为你说黑脸 黑脸
That's it. I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop. "

1161
00:57:52,059 --> 00:57:55,495
好吧 当你发疯那会 看看我从他桌上拿到什么
Well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.

1162
00:57:55,563 --> 00:57:57,656
我想这是他的电话清单      不错
Think it's his phone sheet.        Nice.

1163
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,694
七个打给彩票办公室的电话
Seven calls to the lottery office.

1164
00:58:00,034 --> 00:58:01,558
这可能是我们破毛奇案的证据
That could be the evidence we need for Mauch.

1165
00:58:04,338 --> 00:58:07,205
退后 哥伦比亚毒枭      你从哪把他们招来的?
Get back. Colombian drug lords.        Where are you getting that from?

1166
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:10,204
老天
Jeesus

1167
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,454
如果你没有打伤杰特 你的事业还不飞黄腾达?
Can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?

1168
00:58:29,263 --> 00:58:30,699
我们惹来的 对吧?
We call this in, right?

1169
00:58:31,015 --> 00:58:32,597
看来我们已经拿到所有证据了
Looks like we got all the evidence we need.

1170
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,759
抱歉 我的小蝴蝶
I'm sorry, my butterfly.

1171
00:58:36,137 --> 00:58:39,072
我们把他们装上车 把他们送回去
We'll load them up, send them back to go.

1172
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:51,114
我靠      什么?
Holy shit.        What?

1173
00:58:51,218 --> 00:58:53,914
你什么意思? 什么? 我们在哪?
What do you mean, what? Where are we?

1174
00:58:55,289 --> 00:58:56,722
我们在沙漠
We're in the high desert.

1175
00:58:56,791 --> 00:59:00,557
他们又拿走我的鞋子 他妈的拿我鞋干吗?
They took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?

1176
00:59:00,628 --> 00:59:02,152
他们拿走了你的木枪?      是的
They took your wooden gun?        Yeah.

1177
00:59:08,736 --> 00:59:10,966
喂?      喂 吉恩吗? 我是说 长官
Hello?        Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.

1178
00:59:11,072 --> 00:59:12,471
长官 我是艾伦·甘博
Captain, it's Allen Gamble.

1179
00:59:12,573 --> 00:59:14,404
是 是 你在哪? 发生什么事了?
Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?

1180
00:59:14,475 --> 00:59:17,273
长官 这说来话长了 但是我长话短说
Captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

1181
00:59:17,274 --> 00:59:18,812
我们在拉斯维加斯 好吗?
We are in Las Vegas, all right?

1182
00:59:18,913 --> 00:59:20,264
我们被绑架了 
We were kidnapped, 

1183
00:59:20,715 --> 00:59:22,431
被放在一辆货运火车 然后运到这了
put on a freight train, and shipped out here.

1184
00:59:22,450 --> 00:59:24,784
你就给我说到这 别给我扯蛋
Let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.

1185
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,451
长官 我就和不你绕弯子了
Captain, I am being straight with you.

1186
00:59:26,470 --> 00:59:28,652
听着 我们认为有事发生 好吗?
Look, we think something's going on, okay?

1187
00:59:28,756 --> 00:59:31,823
我们认为厄森想通过彩票来掩盖他的损失
We think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.

1188
00:59:31,842 --> 00:59:37,230
慢着 我明白地告诉过你几次 "别查厄森"?
Wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?

1189
00:59:37,631 --> 00:59:38,928
特里 长官想知道
Terry, Captain wants to know

I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand for that, 

1195

破了卡斯蒂的案子
Solved the Castien case.

1199

那里有上百万的钻石
There's millions of dollars of diamonds in that place.

How about this, Gamble? How about you shut your face?

1202
01:00:17,037 --> 01:00:18,629
好吗? 闭嘴
All right? Just shut it.

1203

You know, I was talking to Gene here.        He prefers "Captain. "

Yes, I was talking to Gene here, and, you know, it's funny.

1215

我不知道你们捅了什么篓子
I don't know what you two have been up to,

1216
01:00:49,503 --> 01:00:53,270
但我一直接到一些从未打电话给我的人的电话
but I've been getting calls from people I don't ever get calls from.

1217

In 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.

当这种事发生的时候 就停手吧
When that happens, stop.

My son's bisexual, so...        Tremendous.

一个从来没有来过这的人
Guy never comes down here.

二十年 我想我只在这栋大楼里见过他一次
Twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.

1225
01:01:21,569 --> 01:01:24,732

He's a heavyweight cat, that guy.        He was sitting right here.

1226

You know what?

1230
01:01:35,916 --> 01:01:37,884
这把木枪我扣下了
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.

1231
01:01:37,952 --> 01:01:39,817
把真枪还给我?      不
To give me back my real gun?        No.

1232
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,979
因为我要给你这个
'Cause I'm gonna give you this.

1233
01:01:42,723 --> 01:01:45,886
是把哨子 当你碰上麻烦 就吹这个
It's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble

1234
01:01:46,494 --> 01:01:49,054
有真枪的人会过来帮你
and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.

1235
01:01:50,431 --> 01:01:53,045

接下来 我要你们
Next, I want you guys to hand in 

1238
01:01:57,277 --> 01:02:00,073
把你们认为的所有证据交给证监会
all the evidence you think you have to the SEC.

1239
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:02,071
金融部分是他们裁决的范围
The financial district's under their jurisdiction.

1240
01:02:02,076 --> 01:02:04,644
你还不明白吗? 这个案子是我们管的
Don't you get it? This case is talking to us!

1241
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:07,740
我是只孔雀 长官 你这次得让我飞一下吧
I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!

1242
01:02:07,815 --> 01:02:10,716
你知道吗 特里? 我们别争了 孔雀不飞
You know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.

1243
01:02:10,784 --> 01:02:14,242
他们就飞那么一点      是 像企鹅那样
They fly, they fly a little bit.        Yeah, about as much as a penguin.

1244
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:17,950
还有个事 帮我个忙 别逞能
One more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.

1245
01:02:18,659 --> 01:02:21,419
是意外吗 还是你只有意引述TLC的歌?
Was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?

1246
01:02:22,062 --> 01:02:23,120
我都不知道你在说什么
I don't even understand the reference.

1247
01:02:23,664 --> 01:02:25,891
你不知道你说了什么?      我不知道那是什么
You don't understand what you said?        I don't know what that is.

1248
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,333
出去      好吧
Get out.        Go.

他们怎么知道这事的?
How did they get that story?

1250
01:02:41,849 --> 01:02:44,818
我真是烦透了被当做弄巧成拙的笨蛋了
I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.

1251
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:45,977
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

1252

我问你件事
Let me ask you something.

1255
01:02:54,461 --> 01:02:56,861
除了打断别人 你还会干点别的事吗?
What do you even do around here besides interrupt people?

1256
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,965
好吧 我是工会的财务主管
Well, I serve as treasurer to the union.

1257

正是 你一无是处
Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!

1259
01:03:08,142 --> 01:03:11,669
也许没错 特里 这就是为啥我总是很难过的原因
Probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.

1260
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,377
我出去走走
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1261
01:03:14,481 --> 01:03:15,743
鲍勃      说点什么
Bob!        Say something.

回来 鲍勃
Come on! Bob!

1263
01:03:17,818 --> 01:03:20,769
我不是那个意思 好吗? 我很生气
I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.

1264
01:03:38,539 --> 01:03:43,636
其实 我们不放在这 这是一个安装的艺术品
Actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.

这个咖啡桌?      是的 我们不在这上面放饮料
This coffee table?        Yes. We don't put drinks on it.

1266
01:03:49,883 --> 01:03:52,845
50万?      他看得懂 恭喜
Five hundred thousand?        He can read! Congratulations.

1267
01:03:53,020 --> 01:03:55,181
什么?      抱歉 你来对地方了吗?
What?        I'm sorry, are you in the right place?

1268
01:03:55,255 --> 01:03:57,553
还是走错了? 我...
Or not? I'm...

1269
01:03:58,759 --> 01:03:59,953
特里      他...好吧
Terry.        Does he... Okay.

1270
01:04:00,027 --> 01:04:03,292
好吧      对不起 特里 你来这干吗?
Well...        Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?

1271
01:04:04,531 --> 01:04:08,900
我想和你在一起      不 特里 这不可能
I want to be with you.        No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.

1272
01:04:09,269 --> 01:04:12,197
你知道你属于哪里 波克山 躺我的身上
You know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.

1273
01:04:12,740 --> 01:04:14,765
而现在 你却在这卖这个脏不拉叽的咖啡桌?
Instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?

1274
01:04:14,942 --> 01:04:16,500
我是说 看看 这东西不知所谓
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!

1275
01:04:16,577 --> 01:04:19,451
特里 这里哈弗菲尔德-詹姆森的原作
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.

1276
01:04:19,452 --> 01:04:23,728
混乱的咖啡桌? 表示我们破碎的自尊
The chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.

1277
01:04:24,051 --> 01:04:26,042
你认为我不认识这个假装艺术家的拉圾?
You think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?

1278
01:04:26,420 --> 01:04:28,312
这个咖啡桌不是什么劳什子的自尊 
This coffee table isn't the ego. 

1279
01:04:28,313 --> 01:04:30,881
它表示在资本主义主导的与世隔绝的面前
It represents our shattered sense of community

1280
01:04:31,225 --> 01:04:33,188
我们大众乱七八糟的品味
in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.

1281
01:04:33,293 --> 01:04:35,200
看起来像是辛迪·谢尔曼
Looks like the work of Cindy Sherman 

1282
01:04:35,201 --> 01:04:36,072
或是弗兰克·斯特拉的作品
or Frank Stella.

1283
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:38,177
你怎么知道这个 特里?
How did you know that, Terry?

1284
01:04:38,298 --> 01:04:39,766
我在罗德岛设计学院上了几堂课
I took some classes at RISD

1285
01:04:39,767 --> 01:04:42,149
这样我可以取笑我邻居那些差劲的假艺术家
so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.

1286
01:04:42,169 --> 01:04:44,569
特里 声音小点      我干吗要说小点
Terry, lower your voice!        I don't have to lower my voice.

1287
01:04:44,638 --> 01:04:46,093
这个男人在骚扰你?
Is this man bothering you?

1288
01:04:46,094 --> 01:04:47,767
你和这个讨厌鬼上床了
Are you actually having sex with this creep?

1289
01:04:47,775 --> 01:04:49,606
特里 他是同志 好不?
Terry, he's gay. Okay?

1290
01:04:50,878 --> 01:04:53,540
他甚至穿了件 "我是同志"的T恤
He's even wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm gay"!

1291
01:04:53,814 --> 01:04:55,929
好吗? 还有 他是我老板
All right? And also, he is my boss.

1292
01:04:56,016 --> 01:04:57,176
为你高兴 小子 好吧
Happy for you, man. Good.

1293
01:04:57,251 --> 01:04:59,116
你现在可以走开吗? 我在和我的女人说话
Can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.

1294
01:04:59,319 --> 01:05:02,652
瑞格先生 没事的 特里正要走了
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.

1295
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:05,149
嘟嘟得不错 水手      老天
Nice toot, sailor.        Jesus.

1296
01:05:06,393 --> 01:05:08,327
特里 你在干吗?
Terry, what are you doing?

1297
01:05:08,829 --> 01:05:12,230
听着 为了让你事业有所发展 我等了你三年
Look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?

1298
01:05:12,566 --> 01:05:13,794
再多给我一年
Just give me one more year.

1299
01:05:14,234 --> 01:05:16,784
特里 没有再一年了 我们完了
Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.

1300
01:05:17,137 --> 01:05:18,195
好吧
Fine.

1301
01:05:18,672 --> 01:05:21,869
特里 别碰那个 特里      哦 我的天啦
Terry, don't touch that! Terry!        Oh, my God!

1302
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,143
我不需要这破玩意 我不需要你
I don't need this shit. I don't need you!

1303
01:05:25,145 --> 01:05:27,478
还有你再打给我 我也不会回来
And when you call me, I'm not coming back!

1304
01:05:28,515 --> 01:05:31,875
哦 小子 好正的1号哦      好男人哟
Oh, boy! Over the top!        How outr?

1305
01:05:31,952 --> 01:05:34,519
我要把这破玩意烧成粉碎
I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!

1306
01:05:35,355 --> 01:05:38,187
有生气 有活力      我喜欢他的直接
Fresh! Energetic!        I love his rawness!

1307
01:05:38,192 --> 01:05:41,619
别评价我了 好吗? 我是个人 我不是件艺术品
Stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!

1308
01:05:41,929 --> 01:05:43,760
是的 你是的      好哇
Yes, you are.        Bravo!

1309
01:05:44,098 --> 01:05:46,794
我是飞越彩虹的孔雀
I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!

1310
01:05:47,468 --> 01:05:49,961
是的 是的
Yes! Yes!

1311
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:01,773
这个炖牛小排尝起来像狗屁股
These braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.

1312
01:06:01,882 --> 01:06:03,677
宝贝      你知道吗 我坐在这里想
Sweetie.        You know what, I'm sitting here thinking,

1313
01:06:03,684 --> 01:06:06,847
这个世界有谁会慢慢炖狗屁股
"Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole

1314
01:06:06,920 --> 01:06:08,888
给他们的老公吃?
"and serve it to their husband?"

1315
01:06:08,956 --> 01:06:12,392
你会的      你太可怕了 怎么了?
You would.        You are being awful. What's wrong?

1316
01:06:12,459 --> 01:06:17,192
长官不让我们查那个案子      我很遗憾
Captain took us off the case.        I'm sorry.

1317
01:06:18,098 --> 01:06:20,987
我告诉特里我在大学的黑暗日子
I told Terry about my dark days in college, 

1318
01:06:20,988 --> 01:06:23,199
让我感触良多
and it brought up some feelings.

1319
01:06:23,337 --> 01:06:26,392
好吧 亲爱的 那是很久以前了
Well, honeydick, that was a long time ago. 

1320
01:06:27,021 --> 01:06:28,871
你已经不是之前那个你了
You're not that same person you were.

1321
01:06:28,875 --> 01:06:32,211
不 你还不明白 我内心有个恶魔
No, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.

1322
01:06:32,212 --> 01:06:35,204
它想出来 出来走走
It wants to get out. It wants to walk around.

1323
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:38,410
它想四处游荡弄点钱 想买些鞋子
It wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.

1324
01:06:38,519 --> 01:06:41,099
它想要和人们边走边说 
And it wants to walk up with the people and say,

1325
01:06:41,100 --> 01:06:43,464
"嘿 盖特不是说着玩的"
 "Hey, Gator don't play no shit. "

1326
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,755
你明白吗?      是的
You feel me?        Yeah.

1327
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:48,919
盖特从不会这样 从不会说着玩的
Gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.

1328
01:06:51,965 --> 01:06:53,956
宝贝 对不起      没事
Sweetie, I'm sorry.        It's okay.

1329
01:06:54,601 --> 01:06:57,968
我只是...      记得我们相遇的那个晚上吗?
I just...        Remember that night we met?

1330
01:06:58,739 --> 01:07:01,109
主治医生告诉我 
The attending physician told me, 

1331
01:07:01,315 --> 01:07:03,804
"后院有个嗑药的皮条客"
"We got a drugged-out pimp in the back. "

1332
01:07:04,144 --> 01:07:07,580
我去到后院 打开窗帘
And I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain,

1333
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:12,832
你脆弱 害怕
You were weak, scared,

1334
01:07:12,853 --> 01:07:16,949
糟透了 发炎 伤心地哭着
ass up, inflamed, crying.

1335
01:07:17,057 --> 01:07:18,767
那时候 我知道 
At that moment, I knew. 

1336
01:07:18,915 --> 01:07:22,155
"嘿 他不是皮条客 皮条客才不哭呢"
"Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry. "

1337
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:27,624
皮条客不哭
Pimps don't cry

1338
01:07:28,936 --> 01:07:31,461
皮条客不哭
Pimps don't cry

1339
01:07:31,572 --> 01:07:34,473
不 他们不会
No they do not

1340
01:07:34,842 --> 01:07:37,811
他们不会流泪
They don't shed a tear

1341
01:07:38,512 --> 01:07:43,848
皮条客才不哭
Pimps don't cry

1342
01:07:44,117 --> 01:07:46,017
他们不会流泪
They never shed a tear

1343
01:07:50,924 --> 01:07:52,294
我们去床上躺躺 
Come lay with me. 

1344
01:07:52,295 --> 01:07:54,361
会让你有安全感 我们来做爱 来吧
Be safe, and let's make love. Come on.

1345
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,861
每次你说安全感 都让我伤心欲绝
Every time you say, "Be safe," it tears me apart.

1346
01:07:56,964 --> 01:07:59,524
你得让我成为我要成为的人
You gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.

1347
01:08:01,134 --> 01:08:03,625
艾伦 我怀孕了
Allen, I'm pregnant.

1348
01:08:04,504 --> 01:08:05,869
是谁的孩子?
Whose baby is that?

1349
01:08:05,973 --> 01:08:07,603
是哪个男人把你肚子搞大的? 
Who's the man who did that to you? 

1350
01:08:07,815 --> 01:08:09,972
盖特的女人都会用套子
Gator's bitches better be using jimmies!

1351
01:08:11,278 --> 01:08:14,938
对不起 看我都说的什么啊
I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.

1352
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:16,340
哦 老天
Oh, my God.

1353
01:08:17,951 --> 01:08:19,350
你走吧
You need to leave.

1354
01:08:19,453 --> 01:08:23,048
滚 滚出去 艾伦 滚出去
Get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!

1355
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:40,738
嘿
Hey

1356
01:08:42,009 --> 01:08:44,534
嘿 你在这干吗?
Hey. What are you doing here?

1357
01:08:47,014 --> 01:08:48,745
我有女人的问题的时候就来这 
Come here when I have lady troubles, 

1358
01:08:49,615 --> 01:08:52,078
也就是说我每晚都来这
which means I come here about every night.

1359
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:54,210
你在这里干吗?
What are you doing here?

1360
01:08:55,389 --> 01:08:57,880
希拉今晚和我吵了一架
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

1361
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:01,057
她把我赶出来了
She threw me out.

1362
01:09:02,095 --> 01:09:03,344
好吧 直到你老婆把你踢出家 
Well, you're not a cop 

1363
01:09:03,345 --> 01:09:05,156
你都不是个警察 老兄
till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.

1364
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:07,242
你在意卡斯蒂抢劫案
Does it bother you that the Castien robbers 

1365
01:09:07,243 --> 01:09:09,568
只带走了七万四的钻石吗?
only took 74 grand in diamonds?

1366
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,871
他们是垃圾 谁在乎? 我是说
They're junkies. Who cares? I mean...

1367
01:09:11,939 --> 01:09:15,739
不过 我不知道一个垃圾会不会降低标准
I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.

1368
01:09:15,842 --> 01:09:17,290
你们两个怎么样?
How are you going?

1369
01:09:18,412 --> 01:09:21,575
我们准备在那台红色普锐斯里搞个小派对
We're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here

1370
01:09:21,682 --> 01:09:22,876
如果你们愿意加入的话
if you wanna join us.

1371
01:09:22,983 --> 01:09:25,342
别靠近那台普锐斯 好吗?
You're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?

1372
01:09:25,385 --> 01:09:28,252
我们的意思是 一群脏兮兮的
Here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos

1373
01:09:28,689 --> 01:09:30,623
无业游民
with fingers in each other's pooper

1374
01:09:30,691 --> 01:09:33,489
在陌生人的车子里大声放广播
in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.

1375
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:35,020
今晚会很不错
It's gonna be a nice evening.

1376
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:37,393
好吧 我们不参加 我们没兴趣
Well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.

1377
01:09:37,597 --> 01:09:38,689
我再说一遍
Let me rephrase it.

1378
01:09:39,099 --> 01:09:41,932
我们有一罐老芥茉酱 一只卷毛狗
We got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle,

1379
01:09:42,135 --> 01:09:45,448
我们过去 然后在上面画些"D" "A"什么的
and we're just get in there and we're gonna put some D's in some A's.

1380
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:47,570
嘿 你们是潇洒哥和他的兄弟们吗?
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?

1381
01:09:47,591 --> 01:09:50,266
你咋知道我们是谁?      你在车内留了张纸条
How do you know who we are?        You left a note in that car.

1382
01:09:50,277 --> 01:09:52,737
警察 笨蛋      他是警察 我们马上走 快呀
Police, shithead.        He's a copper. We gotta go. Come on!

1383
01:09:52,846 --> 01:09:55,067
嘿 快点走 小子们 他们是条子
Hey! Goose it, boys! They're cops!

1384
01:09:55,148 --> 01:09:56,911
跑的时候 在那车上搞点破坏
Rub your dicks on the car as you're running away!

1385
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:59,316
你把我漂亮的普锐斯车变成灾难
You turned my beautiful Prius into a nightmare!

1386
01:09:59,419 --> 01:10:03,082
我们会在你车上做爱 还会再发生的
We are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again!

1387
01:10:05,225 --> 01:10:06,920
我不知道我今晚要睡哪
I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight.

1388
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,791
幸运的是 我知道我们要去哪喝酒

Save yourselves some gas.        Captain!

1516
01:16:31,778 --> 01:16:33,177
我们有没有申诉程序
Is there an appeal process we can...

1517
01:16:33,246 --> 01:16:36,409
你得做你应该做的 长官
Had to do what you had to do, Captain.

1518
01:16:36,516 --> 01:16:38,711
哇 真够惨的
Wow! That hurt.

1519
01:16:40,854 --> 01:16:43,015
不好意思 我车哪去了      他们拖走了
Excuse me. Where's my car?        They towed it.

1520
01:16:43,089 --> 01:16:45,557
一些无家可归的人在上面捣乱
Couple of homeless people were messing around in it.

1521
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:49,288
那是一辆正式的警车      也就骗骗我
That's an official police car.        Could have fooled me.

1522
01:16:54,434 --> 01:16:55,731
哇 毛奇很生气 嗯?
Wow, Mauch was upset, huh?

1523
01:16:56,269 --> 01:16:57,429
是吗?
Really?

1524
01:16:57,537 --> 01:16:59,292
我在我老婆面前唯一值得骄傲的事 
The only thing I had to be proud of in my life

1525
01:16:59,293 --> 01:17:00,184
就是我当了探员
 was being a detective.

1526
01:17:00,185 --> 01:17:02,533
我只有这个了 现在这也没了
That was all I had. Now it's gone.

1527
01:17:03,276 --> 01:17:05,767
我知道 我知道 你还有我
I know. I know. You still got me.

1528
01:17:05,879 --> 01:17:09,406
你还不明白吗? 我不需要你 我从来都不需要你
Don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.

1529
01:17:09,482 --> 01:17:11,712
我告诉过你 脚手架违规的事是狗屎
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.

1530
01:17:12,051 --> 01:17:14,270
我不敢相信 我们干了这么多事后 你还是质疑我
I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.

1531
01:17:14,305 --> 01:17:16,928
这是个真的案子 我是真警察  
It's a real case, and I'm a real cop. 

1532
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,791
我们只是查错了方向
We just got the wrong target for Ershon.

1533
01:17:18,892 --> 01:17:21,522
你带了把哨子      这是真警察的工作
You carry a rape whistle.        This is real cop work.

1534
01:17:21,523 --> 01:17:24,060
你就没有做过一件男人该做的事情 好吗?
There is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?

1535
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:27,866
你没有枪 没有车 没老婆 现在你拍挡也没了
You got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.

1536
01:17:27,867 --> 01:17:29,226
让我单独呆会
Leave me alone.

1537
01:17:29,836 --> 01:17:31,326
一个蠢案子
A mutt case.

1538
01:17:31,438 --> 01:17:33,963
特里 告诉你 我是个警察 好吗?
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?

1539
01:17:34,073 --> 01:17:36,234
散伙的拍档
A broken partnership.

1540
01:17:36,309 --> 01:17:37,435
我是个警察
I'm a cop!

1541
01:17:37,510 --> 01:17:41,173
被降级到一个差劲的工作
And getting busted down to a shitty assignment.

1542
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:44,341
艾伦和特里中了"三连彩"了
Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.

1543
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:50,180
但是有时候 当你倒霉的时候
But sometimes when you get your ass kicked,

1544
01:17:51,424 --> 01:17:54,120
这就是你发现真实的时候
that's when you find out what's real...

1545
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,488
需要做什么的时候
...and what needs doing.

1546
01:18:04,437 --> 01:18:06,496
不管是指挥交通
Whether it's directing traffic...

1547
01:18:06,606 --> 01:18:07,630
走呀
Come on!

1548
01:18:08,107 --> 01:18:11,543
还是破了几百万的诈骗案
...or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.

1549
01:18:23,022 --> 01:18:25,215
你在这里上班?      是 没错
Do you work here?        Yeah, I do.

1550
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:28,024
那边那个撞上卡斯蒂的起重球
The wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.

1551
01:18:28,127 --> 01:18:29,785
也对你的办公室造成损坏?
They also did damage to your office?

1552
01:18:29,796 --> 01:18:32,321
一些警察过来把它封上了
Some police officers came by and sealed it off.

1553
01:18:32,398 --> 01:18:33,729
你记得他们长什么样吗?
Do you recall what they looked like?

1554
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:36,529
其中一个有澳洲口音
One of them had an Australian accent.

1555
01:18:37,070 --> 01:18:40,870
你不是在州彩票工作吧?
You don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?

1556
01:18:40,974 --> 01:18:44,341
不是 我们的主要客户是兰道公司
No. Our main client is Lendl Global.

1557
01:18:44,410 --> 01:18:46,037
可以问下是怎么回事吗?
Can I ask what this is about?

1558
01:18:46,415 --> 01:18:48,615
本月交警之星
TRAFFIC ENFORCER OF THE MONTH

1559
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:52,615
特里·霍兹
Terry Hoitz

1560
01:18:59,492 --> 01:19:01,962
盖特需要他的枪 你个无能的贱人
Gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!

1561
01:19:11,104 --> 01:19:13,197
因为真警察就是这么回事
'Cause that's what a real cop is.

1562
01:19:13,273 --> 01:19:15,964
不 我没说把她关起来 我绝没说过"把她关起来"
No, I didn't say "Lock her up. " I never said, "Lock her up. "

1563
01:19:15,965 --> 01:19:18,673
一个男人做了他该做的事情
A guy who does what needs to be done.

1564
01:19:18,745 --> 01:19:22,704
一个男人知道怎么善用他的黑暗面
A guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.

1565
01:19:22,782 --> 01:19:24,409
然后搬去佛罗里达
And then you move to Florida.

1566
01:19:33,726 --> 01:19:34,852
一 二 三 进攻
One, two, three, attack!

1567

Tap out. Tap out.        It's me, Allen.

1569
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:42,758
你放不放开 还是你要打我的脸?
Are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?

1570
01:19:42,869 --> 01:19:44,530
我放开了
I'm tapping out!

1571
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:48,431
你疯了吗? 你在这干吗 兄弟?
You crazy? What are you doing, man?

1572
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:49,974
他们可能在监视我们      我可能会杀了你
They might be watching us.        Could've killed you.

1573
01:19:50,076 --> 01:19:51,572
关灯      什么?
Turn out the lights.        What?

1574
01:19:51,577 --> 01:19:52,469
他们可能在监视      谁?
They could be watching us.        Who?

1575
01:19:52,712 --> 01:19:55,237
我发现一些重要的消息 好吗?
I found some big information, okay?

1576
01:19:55,315 --> 01:19:58,443
关于什么?      重要信息 特里 惊天大秘密
About what?        Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.

1577
01:19:58,751 --> 01:20:01,549
你怎么进来的? 这地方有安全自锁装置的
How'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.

1578
01:20:01,621 --> 01:20:04,089
我们得更小心      你在说什么?
We can't be too careful.        What are you talking about?

1579
01:20:04,157 --> 01:20:07,320
这地方可能被窃听      这里没有窃听器
This place might be bugged.        There's no bugs in here.

1580
01:20:11,598 --> 01:20:14,590
首先 我想你
First off, I missed you.

1581
01:20:14,667 --> 01:20:17,465
发生什么事了?      你听到我说什么了吗?
What's going on?        Did you hear what I said?

1582
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:21,563
好吧 我也有点想你      谢谢
Fine, I kind of missed you, too.        Thank you.

1583
01:20:21,641 --> 01:20:25,941
好吧 我知道厄森在掩盖谁的损失
Okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.

1584
01:20:26,012 --> 01:20:28,310
是兰道公司      什么?
It's Lendl Global.        What?

1585
01:20:28,414 --> 01:20:30,939
兰道用卡斯蒂抢劫案分散注意
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction

1586
01:20:31,017 --> 01:20:34,009
所以他们可以闯进他们隔壁自己的会计事务所
so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.

1587
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,317
然后他们调换了记录来掩盖
They then altered all the records to cover the losses

1588
01:20:37,423 --> 01:20:40,187
厄森投资失败的损失
that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.

1589
01:20:40,426 --> 01:20:42,034
你不应该做这事的 
You're not supposed to be doing this. 

1590
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,133
你应该巡街的
You're supposed to be walking the beat.

1591
01:20:44,168 --> 01:20:46,724
我知道 不过很机智吧 嗯?
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?

1592
01:20:46,933 --> 01:20:48,958
这不好 艾伦 这不好
This is bad, Allen. This is bad.

1593
01:20:49,035 --> 01:20:51,503
难怪长官想让我们不要管这个
No wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.

1594
01:20:51,604 --> 01:20:53,997
是的 我想比曼开始质疑了
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.

1595
01:20:54,006 --> 01:20:55,774
这就是他们杀他的原因      老天
That's why they killed him.        Man.

1596
01:20:55,842 --> 01:20:57,002
还有件事
Here's the other thing.

1597
01:20:57,110 --> 01:20:59,101
明天 会有一单大生意
Tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.

1598
01:20:59,312 --> 01:21:00,677
厄森主导
Ershon's leading it.

1599
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:01,986
我还是不知道
I still can't figure out 

1600
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:03,648
他们在和哪个可怜的家伙做生意
who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with,

1601
01:21:03,716 --> 01:21:04,876
但是我们得阻止这单生意
but we gotta stop it.

1602
01:21:04,984 --> 01:21:06,645
是时候让孔雀飞起来了
It's time to let the peacock fly.

1603
01:21:07,687 --> 01:21:09,552
我不去 艾伦 我喜欢我现在做的
I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.

1604
01:21:09,989 --> 01:21:12,116
我也是 我们是警察
So do I. We're cops.

1605
01:21:12,191 --> 01:21:17,069
不 我喜欢我现在做的 我喜欢做交警 很不错
No. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.

1606
01:21:17,070 --> 01:21:17,853
什么?
What?

1607
01:21:18,464 --> 01:21:22,280
我喜欢指挥交通 我不和你去
I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.

1608
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:24,826
指挥个屁交通?
What is this traffic bullshit?

1609
01:21:28,641 --> 01:21:32,168
你在说什么?      我在说我的人生
What are you talking about?        I'm talking about my life.

1610
01:21:32,245 --> 01:21:35,395
我管的54街和第3大道的路口 很忙的
The corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.

1611
01:21:35,396 --> 01:21:38,885
这是特里的十字路口 其实交警呢? 他们是好人
It's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.

1612
01:21:38,891 --> 01:21:41,877
有一个家伙 菲利浦? 他可以离便池20英尺尿尿
There's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.

1613
01:21:41,988 --> 01:21:43,548
你得看看 艾伦 你得看看
You've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.

1614
01:21:43,549 --> 01:21:46,160
你怎么回事? 我们的时光怎么了?
What happened to you? What happened to this being our time?

1615
01:21:46,161 --> 01:21:48,320
不行 艾伦 我退出 我不干了
No way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.

1616
01:21:49,562 --> 01:21:52,429
上车      拜托 艾伦 我们都知道这是木枪
Get in the car.        Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.

1617
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:57,834
离开这 现在上车      你不会开枪打我的
Apartment pop. Now get in the car.        You're not gonna shoot me.

1618
01:21:57,904 --> 01:22:00,759
好吧 我老实说 这是我第二次开枪
Okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.

1619
01:22:00,763 --> 01:22:01,967
那别指着我了
So stop pointing it at me.

1620
01:22:01,991 --> 01:22:06,402
听着 明天早上 我只知道我要去找毛奇 好吗?
Look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?

1621
01:22:06,403 --> 01:22:07,455
为了什么? 他不在乎
For what? He doesn't care.

1622
01:22:07,513 --> 01:22:10,676
他回避这个案子很久了 我需要答案
He's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.

1623
01:22:10,750 --> 01:22:13,014
我要他看着我的眼睛 告诉我为什么
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.

1624
01:22:13,086 --> 01:22:15,884
看看新闻 兄弟 没人在乎
Turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.

1625
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:17,921
我希望我不是一个人
I hope I'm not alone.

1626
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:21,250
希望你能带上胆子
Hope you bring it.

Jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.

1633

1639
01:22:59,799 --> 01:23:03,746
我想要把橡树类的放一起 和枫树类分开 好吗?
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?

1640
01:23:03,747 --> 01:23:04,994
还有这些切菜板?
And these chopping boards?

1641
01:23:04,995 --> 01:23:05,829
嘿 长官
Hey, Captain.

1642
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:09,798
嘿 艾伦 怎么样?
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?

1643
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:11,822
你来干吗? 来买新的浴室防滑垫?
What are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?

1644
01:23:12,178 --> 01:23:15,841
我需要你坦白告诉我      我们之间坦白
I need you to be straight with me.        Straight with us.

1645
01:23:15,948 --> 01:23:18,644
嘿 特里 看看你们俩
Hey, Terry. Look at this.

1646
01:23:18,751 --> 01:23:22,414
我以为你要指挥交通      让他们堵着吧
I thought you were working traffic today.        Let them block the box.

1647
01:23:22,822 --> 01:23:26,280
另外 搭档章程 对吧?      谢谢
Besides, partners' code, right?        Thanks.

1648
01:23:27,827 --> 01:23:30,521
嘿 为什么你非要将这个案子终止?
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?

1649
01:23:31,864 --> 01:23:34,958
好吧 好吧 我来告诉你们些事情
All right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.

1650
01:23:35,034 --> 01:23:38,333
你们真的查得很深 查得很深
You really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.

1651
01:23:38,437 --> 01:23:40,371
厄森和上层都有联络
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups,

1652
01:23:40,473 --> 01:23:43,760
我得为自己留条后路 好吗?
and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?

1653
01:23:43,976 --> 01:23:46,137
虽然你现在一直对外界隐瞒这些肮脏的事情
You keep hiding from shit in the world,

1654
01:23:46,212 --> 01:23:48,826
但最终事情还是会被揭发的
and eventually the world comes to your front door.

1655
01:23:48,948 --> 01:23:51,278
很好      说得真好
Nice.        That's very nice.

1656
01:23:51,284 --> 01:23:53,342
这是我从某集《天使在人间》里学来的台词
I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.

1657
01:23:53,386 --> 01:23:55,038
如果你们能悄悄地调查这事 
You keep this thing real quiet, 

1658
01:23:55,120 --> 01:23:57,380
并找到确凿的证据
and you make sure you have real evidence,

1659
01:23:57,490 --> 01:23:59,348
那或许我可以看看有什么能帮得上忙的
and maybe I'll see what I can do.

1660
01:23:59,358 --> 01:24:00,352
但如果你们大张旗鼓
But if you make a lot of noise

1661
01:24:00,459 --> 01:24:03,622
引来媒体的注意 把地方检察官也牵扯进来
and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,

1662
01:24:03,696 --> 01:24:05,520
那就不用来找我帮忙了 明白了吗?
I am out, okay?

1663
01:24:05,564 --> 01:24:06,661
行 我们会安静得像教堂里的老鼠一样
Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.

1664
01:24:06,732 --> 01:24:10,398
但职业生涯中总有那么一个案子 
But there's one case, one case in a career 

1665
01:24:10,399 --> 01:24:12,425
是他会倾尽全力去调查的 现在就是这样
where you go all in. This is it.

1666
01:24:12,905 --> 01:24:16,238
很好 那就做给我们看吧
All right. Then you do us proud.

1667
01:24:16,742 --> 01:24:18,189
因为我不需要"二流警探"
'Cause I don't want no scrubs.

1668
01:24:18,744 --> 01:24:21,304
真的?      是的
Really?        No.

1669
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:23,472
你没发现这是首TLC乐队的歌?
You're not aware that's a TLC song?

1670
01:24:23,615 --> 01:24:25,058
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1671
01:24:25,093 --> 01:24:26,383
第二次了      你说不要逞能
Second time.        You said chasing waterfalls,

1672
01:24:26,485 --> 01:24:27,645
现在你又说你不需要二流警探
now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.

1673
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:29,517
我都不知道那是什么来的      这是个口头禅
I don't even understand the reference.        It's like a tic.

1674
01:24:29,589 --> 01:24:30,715
我不知道你在说什么
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1675
01:24:30,823 --> 01:24:33,487
记住 如果这事捅娄子了 就当我们从未谈过这事
Remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.

1676
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,221
你可以相信我们      必须暗地里行事
You can trust us.        Real quiet.

1677
01:24:35,328 --> 01:24:37,792
小心谨慎 悄无声息知道吗
You gotta creep. Creep.

1678
01:24:37,864 --> 01:24:39,161
又来了
Come on.

1679
01:24:40,099 --> 01:24:41,430
除非你是在引用TLC的歌词 
You don't say "Creep-creep" 

1680
01:24:41,431 --> 01:24:43,070
不然你不会说"悄无生息"
unless you're quoting TLC.

1681
01:24:43,071 --> 01:24:44,234
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

1682
01:24:45,204 --> 01:24:47,369
你们知道丹森和海史密斯不是好警察吧?
You know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?

1683
01:24:47,740 --> 01:24:49,537
是的 我们知道 但也是没办法的
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.

1684
01:24:49,609 --> 01:24:51,509
我是说 剩下的人里还有谁能做英雄呢
I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?

1685
01:24:51,844 --> 01:24:55,307
虽然我不想说 但有可能是你们俩
Not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.

1686
01:24:56,449 --> 01:24:58,007
你准备好了吗
You ready?

1687
01:24:58,084 --> 01:24:59,745
好了      我们走
Yeah.        Let's go.

1688
01:25:08,261 --> 01:25:10,627
不 挑染的部分很好看      谢谢
No, but the highlights are great.        Thank you.

1689
01:25:10,730 --> 01:25:12,889
性感但又很庄重      谢谢
Sexy but serious.        Thank you.

1690
01:25:12,899 --> 01:25:14,264
打扰一下
Excuse me.

1691
01:25:15,268 --> 01:25:17,930
这他妈都是些什么人? 我只想见一个人而已
Who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.

1692
01:25:18,037 --> 01:25:22,531
呃 就是一些人我欠了他们钱 他们自己要来的
You know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.

1693
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,100
他们是谁?
Who are they?

1694
01:25:25,211 --> 01:25:29,910
呃 车臣的一些爱国者 还有一些企业家
Well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.

1695
01:25:29,982 --> 01:25:35,818
然后那些黑人小伙子是从尼日利亚来的
And the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.

1696
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:38,657
你欠尼日利亚人跟车臣人的钱?
You owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?

1697
01:25:38,658 --> 01:25:39,934
呃 是的 我欠他们钱
Yes. Yes, I do.

1698
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:42,955
你有两下子嘛      谢谢
You're a piece of work.        Thank you.

1699
01:25:43,129 --> 01:25:46,496
我们最好还是开始吧
Probably best to get started.

1700
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:50,391
这样不错 伙计 我们已经入局了 而且知道比分
This is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.

1701
01:25:50,469 --> 01:25:51,693
唯一让我不爽的是
The only thing that bugs me is

1702
01:25:51,694 --> 01:25:53,405
我还是不知道厄森的目标是什么
 we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.

1703
01:25:53,472 --> 01:25:55,787
是彩票吗? 幕后又是谁?
Is it the lotto? Who is it?

1704
01:25:55,788 --> 01:25:57,969
谁在乎? 肯定是某个有钱的蠢蛋
Who cares? Some rich prick.

1705
01:25:57,969 --> 01:26:03,704
我必须告诉你们 我对于这个交易很兴奋
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.

1706
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:06,251
我可以跟你们保证你们投入的每一分钱
And I can assure you that every dime of your money

1707
01:26:06,252 --> 01:26:09,518
都将被最大限度的利用
will be invested with the utmost diligence.

1708
01:26:09,519 --> 01:26:11,323
你们给出的回报率确实很让人兴奋
Your rates of return are really exciting.

1709
01:26:11,424 --> 01:26:12,948
我们的成员们一定会眼前一亮
We think our members are gonna be just thrilled.

1710
01:26:13,025 --> 01:26:17,559
是的 过去十年的平均回报率  差不多有18%
Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.

1711
01:26:17,964 --> 01:26:20,159
我们现在要像教堂的老鼠 安静得进去再出来
All right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.

1712
01:26:20,266 --> 01:26:22,600
我现在可以感受到你说的那种蛋疼的性奋
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.

1713
01:26:22,601 --> 01:26:23,659
很好
Beautiful.

1714
01:26:23,769 --> 01:26:25,168
好了 你们听着
All right, listen up.

1715
01:26:25,271 --> 01:26:28,172
我是甘博探员 这位是霍兹探员
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.

1716
01:26:28,274 --> 01:26:30,435
我们需要你们的配合
We need your cooperation.

1717
01:26:30,509 --> 01:26:31,976
大卫·厄森
David Ershon.

1718
01:26:32,044 --> 01:26:34,376
你因诈骗和贪污
You're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement,

1719
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:36,575
以及涉嫌唐·比曼被杀一案被捕了
and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.

1720
01:26:36,682 --> 01:26:38,115
这不是个好主意
This is a bad idea.

1721
01:26:38,617 --> 01:26:39,982
嘿 伙计们
Hey, guys.

1722
01:26:41,554 --> 01:26:44,022
鲍勃? 你在这干什么?
Bob? What are you doing here?

1723
01:26:44,490 --> 01:26:45,821
我在投资啊
I'm investing.

1724
01:26:45,891 --> 01:26:48,625
你们还记得我们之前谈到的代理人投票那事吗?
Do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?

1725
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:50,371
说的就是这事      见鬼
This is what it was for.        Holy shit.

1726
01:26:50,372 --> 01:26:52,854
这只是一个更冒险的抚恤金投资
It's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.

1727
01:26:52,855 --> 01:26:56,964
艾伦! 我们太蠢了 他们的目标是警察的抚恤金
Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.

1728
01:27:03,309 --> 01:27:07,408
先生们 你们无权来这儿 而且也没有授权令
Gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.

1729
01:27:07,847 --> 01:27:09,914
我们有权采取行动
We are within our rights to take action.

1730
01:28:07,706 --> 01:28:09,723
不能再像教堂里的老鼠了!
So much for quiet as church mice!

1731
01:28:10,076 --> 01:28:11,168
跑!
Go!

1732
01:28:16,315 --> 01:28:17,680
那些人他妈的到底是谁?
Who the hell are those guys?

1733
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:18,297
先生们 
Gentlemen, 

1734
01:28:18,298 --> 01:28:20,811
我可以搞到摇滚年代的票 不过视野不太好
I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.

1735
01:28:20,886 --> 01:28:22,696
虽然我也承认那没吸引力 
Even I admit that's not very tempting, 

1736
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:24,846
但我也不是什么票都能弄到的 该死的!
but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!

1737
01:28:24,924 --> 01:28:27,158
到前座去      你是怎么想到的?
Get in the front!        How do you start this freaking thing?

1738
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:28,148
快点!快!
Go on! Go!

1739
01:28:28,894 --> 01:28:30,243
妈的!      快开!
Shit!        Go!

1740
01:28:32,364 --> 01:28:33,353
哦 天...
Oh, my...

1741
01:28:34,767 --> 01:28:38,114
吉妮! 过来! 你 去把车开来!
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!

1742
01:29:24,216 --> 01:29:25,205
抓住方向盘!
Hold the wheel!

1743
01:29:30,923 --> 01:29:33,289
打开后备箱!      知道了 我知道了!
Open the back!        I got it. I got it!

1744
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:44,235
他们会杀了我 然后再来杀你们
They're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.

1745
01:29:44,336 --> 01:29:46,736
我会先杀了你的!      然后他们会再杀我一次
Well, I'm gonna kill you first!        And then they will kill me.

1746
01:29:46,839 --> 01:29:49,865
现有两名游手好闲的警察 他们佩有枪支很危险
We have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous,

1747
01:29:49,975 --> 01:29:51,636
并且挟持了大卫·厄森      愚蠢的有钱人!
and holding David Ershon hostage.        Stupid pricks!

1748
01:29:51,710 --> 01:29:55,282
是我们 我们是好警察      没错 他们是好警察
It's us, we're good guys!        Exactly. They're the good guys.

1749
01:29:55,283 --> 01:29:57,475
我们去哪? 我们去哪?
Where do we go? Where do we go?

1750
01:29:57,550 --> 01:30:00,212
我有一个小公寓 没人知道那
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.

1751
01:30:00,319 --> 01:30:03,015
只有我父母跟妓女住过
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.

1752
01:30:03,088 --> 01:30:05,511
不是同时 那样就麻烦了
Not at the same time. That would be wrong.

1753
01:30:08,427 --> 01:30:11,123
你就从头说起吧
Let's hear it from the top, every detail.

1754
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,569
我觉得讲故事的最好方法就是
I think the best way to tell the story is 

1755
01:30:13,915 --> 01:30:16,588
从结尾开始简单叙述
by starting at the end, briefly,

1756
01:30:16,589 --> 01:30:18,829
然后回到开头
then going back to the beginning, 

1757
01:30:19,317 --> 01:30:21,624
再阶段性地总结跟结尾的关系
and then periodically returning to the end,

1758
01:30:21,659 --> 01:30:24,567
或许在过程中还应该给出不同角色的一些观点
maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.

1759
01:30:24,677 --> 01:30:26,481
这样才比较生动 
Just to give it a bit of dynamism, 

1760
01:30:26,482 --> 01:30:28,046
否则 那就是一个单调的故事
otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.

1761
01:30:28,047 --> 01:30:29,207
快告诉我们到底发生了什么事
Just tell us what happened.

1762
01:30:29,315 --> 01:30:31,217
我损失掉了某些人的一大笔钱 
I lost a bunch of money from some people 

1763
01:30:31,218 --> 01:30:32,493
现在他们想要拿回那笔钱
and now they want it back.

1764
01:30:32,528 --> 01:30:33,681
那唐·比曼是怎么回事?
What about Don Beaman?

1765
01:30:33,752 --> 01:30:36,343
比曼知道我篡改了一些我的财务报表
Beaman knew that I had falsified my financials,

1766
01:30:36,355 --> 01:30:39,053
所以他们派了韦斯利来封他的口
so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.

1767
01:30:39,358 --> 01:30:41,413
韦斯利用枪对着他逼他喝了好多杜松子酒
He forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin

1768
01:30:41,414 --> 01:30:43,552
再把他逼上了窗台
and then forced him onto the ledge.

1769
01:30:43,553 --> 01:30:45,158
他什么时候掉下去只是时间的问题
It was only a matter of time before he fell.

1770
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:48,667
至少我们阻止了你得到那笔抚恤金
At least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.

1771
01:30:48,734 --> 01:30:52,049
嗯 不对 你们没能阻止 那笔钱已在我账户里了
Well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.

1772
01:30:52,071 --> 01:30:55,265
到早上9点 那笔钱汇入了兰道自有基金
By 9:00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund

1773
01:30:55,266 --> 01:30:57,536
然后从那个基金汇给好几个海外账户
and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.

1774
01:30:57,543 --> 01:30:59,067
9点01分之前 这些钱就都会被转走
By 9:01, it's gone.

1775
01:30:59,178 --> 01:31:02,170
那如果我们阻止转账呢?      但你们不能阻止
Well, what if we stop the transfer?        But you can't.

1776
01:31:02,248 --> 01:31:04,716
那如果我们阻止转账呢?
What if we stop the transfer?

1777
01:31:04,783 --> 01:31:08,144
你们必须在9点整时出现在地方银行
You'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9:00 exactly,

1778
01:31:08,145 --> 01:31:10,311
找到那个办事员 拿到分行代号
find the clerk, get the routing number.

1779
01:31:10,312 --> 01:31:11,347
我们必须阻止这件事
We gotta stop it.

1780
01:31:11,423 --> 01:31:12,617
但那不可能
There's no way.

1781
01:31:12,725 --> 01:31:15,120
每一个警察 还有那个澳大利亚疯子和他的手下
Every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, 

1782
01:31:15,255 --> 01:31:16,346
都会来追捕我们
they'll all be after us.

1783
01:31:16,428 --> 01:31:20,674
你们可以放我走 我给你们每人一百万
You could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.

1784
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:24,193
这不是贿赂      这就是贿赂
It's not a bribe.        Of course it's a bribe.

1785
01:31:24,270 --> 01:31:26,697
你试图给我们钱让我们不要完成我们的工作
You're offering to pay us money to not do our job.

1786
01:31:28,474 --> 01:31:29,736
这不是贿赂
It's not a bribe.

1787
01:31:30,376 --> 01:31:32,776
我们今晚低调行事 没人知道这个地方
We hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.

1788
01:31:32,878 --> 01:31:34,917
我们会很安全 然后明天我们就去银行
We'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.

1789
01:31:35,381 --> 01:31:37,075
但首先 我要去见见希拉
First things first, I gotta go see Sheila.

1790
01:31:37,126 --> 01:31:38,381
不行 那很危险
No way, it's too dangerous.

1791
01:31:38,484 --> 01:31:40,782
听着 特里 我们都不知道明天会发生什么
Look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow,

1792
01:31:40,886 --> 01:31:44,413
但今晚 我必须去见希拉对她有个交代
but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.

1793
01:31:44,923 --> 01:31:47,223
好吧 去吧 去吧 小心点
All right, go. Go. Be careful.

1794
01:31:47,293 --> 01:31:48,920
谢谢 我会的
Thanks, I will.

1795
01:31:49,762 --> 01:31:50,990
你会帮我跟希拉问好吗?
Will you say hi to Sheila for me?

1796
01:31:51,163 --> 01:31:52,926
好的      很好
Okay.        Okay.

1797
01:31:52,998 --> 01:31:55,967
告诉她说 特里有问起过她
Tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.

1798
01:31:56,068 --> 01:31:57,501
他希望你知道
He wants to make sure you know

1799
01:31:57,603 --> 01:31:59,969
不管发生什么事他都会在你需要时出现的
that he'll be there for you if anything happens.

1800
01:32:00,072 --> 01:32:02,131
好      危急关头我会立马出现
Yeah.        Drop of a hat, I'm there.

1801
01:32:02,341 --> 01:32:04,332
听着 伙计 再往下说就有些奇怪了
Look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.

1802
01:32:04,443 --> 01:32:07,344
如果你发生了什么事 我必须照顾她
If something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.

1803
01:32:07,446 --> 01:32:10,487
她所有想要的东西 需求 渴望我都会满足她
All of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.

1804
01:32:10,489 --> 01:32:12,610
你干嘛说得好像是事先就决定好的事情?
Why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?

1805
01:32:12,818 --> 01:32:14,183
去吧 伙计
Just go, man.

1806
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:16,810
好的 谢谢
Okay. Thanks.

1807
01:32:17,356 --> 01:32:18,448
去吧
Go.

1808
01:32:22,428 --> 01:32:23,688
雅内可美术馆
Janeco Gallery.

1809
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:26,623
弗朗辛 我是特里 别挂电话
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.

1810
01:32:37,343 --> 01:32:38,503
接电话吧
Please pick up.

1811
01:32:39,378 --> 01:32:40,538
喂
Hello.

1812
01:32:40,646 --> 01:32:43,809
嘿 亲爱的 我猜你在你妈妈家里
Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.

1813
01:32:43,882 --> 01:32:47,517
你知道吗 我不能说太多 我猜这电话被窃听了
You know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.

1814
01:32:47,518 --> 01:32:49,977
宝贝 你在哪里? 我想见你
Baby, where are you? I wanna see you.

1815
01:32:49,988 --> 01:32:52,649
我在我们上次万圣节做了三次的那个地方
I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.

1816
01:32:52,650 --> 01:32:53,582
记得吗?
Do you remember?

1817
01:32:54,226 --> 01:32:55,625
哦 记得
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1818
01:32:55,694 --> 01:32:56,911
我是来告诫你 
I'm just warning you, though.

1819
01:32:57,415 --> 01:32:59,727
要小心 我觉得他们在监视你们
 Watch out. I think they're watching the house.

1820
01:32:59,762 --> 01:33:02,092
别担心 亲爱的 我想我有办法跟你说话
Don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.

1821
01:33:02,534 --> 01:33:06,470
我得说 我不想来的 我是说...
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...

1822
01:33:07,639 --> 01:33:11,075
这么多年来的限制令什么的
After all those years, after the restraining order.

1823
01:33:11,176 --> 01:33:14,543
我担心我可能再也见不到你了
I was worried I might not see you again.

1824
01:33:14,646 --> 01:33:16,238
一些很危险的人在找他
There's some very dangerous people after him,

1825
01:33:16,348 --> 01:33:17,772
现在他们在找我们
and now they're after us.

1826
01:33:20,586 --> 01:33:21,985
只是个老女人
It's just the old lady.

1827
01:33:27,559 --> 01:33:28,992
你好 艾伦
Hello, Allen.

1828
01:33:29,061 --> 01:33:31,655
你好 罗马斯妈妈 你来外面做什么呢?
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?

1829
01:33:31,730 --> 01:33:35,474
希拉说她不明白发生了什么事 她想要你回去
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.

1830
01:33:36,168 --> 01:33:38,033
她还说...      嗯
She also says...        Yes.

1831
01:33:38,103 --> 01:33:41,937
...她想让你在她的上面 捧着她的头发
...she wants you on top of her, holding her hair,

1832
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:44,465
像骑一匹难驯的马那样骑着她
and riding her like a bucking bronco

1833
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:48,639
她吮吸你的大拇指说着"妈妈喜欢"
while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey. "

1834
01:33:49,181 --> 01:33:51,139
你告诉你的女儿...
You, you tell your daughter...

1835
01:33:51,140 --> 01:33:53,550
他说他会一直爱你
He said he'll always love you.

1836
01:33:53,619 --> 01:33:56,281
他很高兴你有了他的孩子
And he's so happy that you're having his child.

1837
01:33:56,388 --> 01:33:57,548
艾伦
Allen.

1838
01:33:57,623 --> 01:33:59,454
他还说
He also says that

1839
01:33:59,558 --> 01:34:02,321
他要你做那事的时候
he wants you to stare into each other's eyes 

1840
01:34:02,322 --> 01:34:04,326
相互看着对方的眼睛不要眨眼
without blinking while you do it.

1841
01:34:04,329 --> 01:34:06,849
我爱极了我们做爱的那一刻 妈妈      这之后
I love when we do that, Mom.        And then afterward,

1842
01:34:07,132 --> 01:34:09,100
他说要互相口交
lick the sex off each other.

1843
01:34:10,669 --> 01:34:12,569
我不想干了
I don't wanna do this.

1844
01:34:13,972 --> 01:34:16,221
你们讲话太肉麻了
You say things that are too personal.

1845
01:34:16,222 --> 01:34:17,998
但这是最后一次
Okay, but just one more thing.

1846
01:34:17,999 --> 01:34:19,643
她说她爱你
She said she loves you,

1847
01:34:19,711 --> 01:34:23,105
想要和你牵着手一起喝冰茶
and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.

1848
01:34:23,482 --> 01:34:26,327
拜托 那不是她说的吧
Come on. That's not all she said.

1849
01:34:26,485 --> 01:34:27,679
不是
No.

1850
01:34:28,754 --> 01:34:32,349
她说了别的 但是我不想...      求求你说吧
She says other things, but I don't want...        Please, please, please.

1851
01:34:32,424 --> 01:34:34,838
你不知道吗 明天我可能就被杀了
You don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.

1852
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:36,354
好吧
Okay.

1853
01:34:38,897 --> 01:34:44,066
她说她想关掉所有的钟和电话
She says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones

1854
01:34:44,067 --> 01:34:47,367
来一次三天的做爱马拉松      这才像她说的
and have a three-day F marathon.        That's more like it. Yeah.

1855
01:34:47,372 --> 01:34:52,577
她想一周都下不了床 因为你们做得太激烈了
She wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.

1856
01:34:52,578 --> 01:34:53,806
太美好了
That's just lovely.

1857
01:34:54,213 --> 01:34:57,842
够了! 他说的话我没法说
No more! He says things I can't say.

1858
01:34:57,916 --> 01:35:00,268
又是仿真手 
It involves a mannequin hand 

1859
01:35:00,269 --> 01:35:03,885
又是高尔夫球棒 还绑着什么电动剃须刀
and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.

1860
01:35:12,231 --> 01:35:13,289
她又说了什么?
Now what'd she say?

1861
01:35:15,767 --> 01:35:17,530
她说她爱你
She says she loves you.

1862
01:35:23,775 --> 01:35:26,107
这一切我深感抱歉
I'm so sorry about everything.

1863
01:35:27,115 --> 01:35:31,517
我今晚只是来这儿告诉你 我爱你
And I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.

1864
01:35:31,915 --> 01:35:35,386
我把你当做一个平凡的妻子是因为
And the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that

1865
01:35:37,055 --> 01:35:41,116
我怕如果我承认你是多么的漂亮
I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning

1866
01:35:41,226 --> 01:35:44,024
多么的聪明 多么的美妙
and intelligent and wonderful you are,

1867
01:35:44,897 --> 01:35:49,081
我就会失去你      别说了 艾伦 我爱你
I'd just lose you.        Shut up, Allen. I love you.

1868
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:52,032
有个很安全的地方
We have a place that's safe. All right.

1869
01:36:04,583 --> 01:36:05,811
我要操红你的小屁屁
I'm gonna break your hip.

1870
01:36:14,593 --> 01:36:17,491
轮到爷爷上阵啦
I'm about to do you grandpa-style.

1871
01:36:23,515 --> 01:36:26,715
早上8点36分
转账前24分钟

1872
01:36:32,311 --> 01:36:33,938
我带了点儿音乐来
I brought some music.

1873
01:36:38,450 --> 01:36:40,441
不是我原本想要的 不过就这样吧
Not what I would've chosen, but screw it.

1874
01:36:40,519 --> 01:36:43,784
好吧 出发吧 "周一早晨" 该工作了
All right. Let's go, Monday morning, time to go to work.

1875
01:36:43,855 --> 01:36:45,031
出发吧
Let's do it.

1876
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:46,819
你要我大门密码吗?      闭嘴!
You want my gate code?        Shut up, man!

1877
01:36:54,366 --> 01:36:55,458
那是韦斯利!
That's Wesley!

1878
01:37:06,511 --> 01:37:07,603
成功穿越!
Yes!

1879
01:37:10,015 --> 01:37:12,540
你从哪儿学来这样开车的?      《侠盗车手》
Where'd you learn to drive like that?        Grand Theft Auto!

1880
01:37:15,487 --> 01:37:16,765
靠 艾伦 他们来了
Shit, Allen, they're coming.

1881
01:37:19,625 --> 01:37:22,185
哦 天哪!      靠
Oh, my God!        Shit.

1882
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,717
做点什么吧 艾伦!      稳住 稳住
Do something, Allen!        Hold on, hold on.

1883
01:37:46,652 --> 01:37:48,549
他玩了《侠盗车手》那招啊
Someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.

1884
01:37:50,222 --> 01:37:51,553
我成功了!
I did that!

1885
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:53,318
我成功了!      哦 天哪!
I did that!        Oh, my God!

1886
01:37:53,392 --> 01:37:55,740
我就说嘛!      他们翻车喽!
That's what I'm talking about!        We jackknifed them!

1887
01:37:55,761 --> 01:37:58,252
看到了吗? 它向后退然后就翻了车
Did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.

1888
01:37:58,363 --> 01:38:00,410
盖特把货车翻了过来 
Gator turns vans upside-down 

1889
01:38:00,411 --> 01:38:02,125
车就好像进了个超级无敌洗衣机
like they're in a crazy washing machine!

1890
01:38:02,134 --> 01:38:04,718
为什么你要叫自己盖特?
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

1891
01:38:04,736 --> 01:38:07,300
那是我在大学时的昵称 用于一些约会服务

He was a pimp.        Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.

1893
01:38:10,709 --> 01:38:13,177
是我身上有味道还是车本身就一股鹿的阴道味?
Is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?

1894
01:38:14,212 --> 01:38:15,338
我可怜的车啊
My poor car.

1895
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:18,149
现在整个街区面临一场屠杀
Right now the streets are a bloodbath.

1896
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:21,294
统计了一下 这儿有大约30名儿童
And, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here,

1897
01:38:21,453 --> 01:38:23,744
你们中的10个将在你们下个生日前死去
10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.

1898
01:38:23,755 --> 01:38:26,815
记住几点 能让你们远离监狱
Got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.

One, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.

1900
01:38:30,518 --> 01:38:33,493

It's a good tip.        Yeah. Two...

1901
01:38:33,598 --> 01:38:34,995
先生们 有情况
Gentlemen, we got a hot one.

1902
01:38:34,996 --> 01:38:38,765
霍兹和甘博挟持了厄森 开车高速飞驰在路上
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.

1903
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:40,758
好的! 枪 枪!
Yes! Gun, gun!

1904
01:38:40,759 --> 01:38:42,773
把枪传过来 传过来 出发吧 伙计
Pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.

1905
01:38:42,774 --> 01:38:44,401
我们要走了 谁有电击枪 没有吗
There we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?

1906
01:38:44,476 --> 01:38:46,209
很好 谁想要一起去?
Good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?

1907
01:38:46,210 --> 01:38:47,444
我!
I do!

1908
01:38:47,946 --> 01:38:49,311
好吧 就你了 甜心 来吧 我们出发 快
All right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.

1909
01:38:49,414 --> 01:38:51,108
快! 出发      快跑!
Move! Let's go.        Come on!

1910
01:39:01,159 --> 01:39:04,403
帅呆了 有架直升机! 肯定是用来高速追踪的
Cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.

1911
01:39:09,301 --> 01:39:10,666
天哪!
Jesus!

1912
01:39:15,507 --> 01:39:18,505
那些家伙是谁?      他们是车臣投资商
Who are those guys?        They're Chechen investors.

1913
01:39:18,506 --> 01:39:21,436
我们打算做一个《探险家朵拉》的车臣版本
We were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.

1914
01:39:21,513 --> 01:39:23,805
不管怎样 现在已经一团糟了
Anyway, it went terribly wrong.

1915
01:39:26,284 --> 01:39:28,779
他们有架直升机 这事让我觉得很不公平!
I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!

1916
01:39:29,488 --> 01:39:30,546
哦 不
Oh, no.

1917
01:39:31,957 --> 01:39:33,015
该死的
Damn it.

1918
01:39:36,895 --> 01:39:39,663
注意你的脑袋 天哪 你的头发好软
Watch your head. God, your hair is soft.

1919
01:39:39,664 --> 01:39:41,297
我用的VO5护发素
VO5 Hot Oil.

1920
01:39:44,236 --> 01:39:46,774
你这准得完蛋! 两边都有来车
You're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!

1921
01:39:46,775 --> 01:39:47,960
我才不要完蛋呢!
I'm not gonna wreck!

1922
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:51,771
我要完蛋了! 被你说中了!      要我来开么?
I'm gonna wreck! You're right!        You want me to drive?

1923
01:40:11,496 --> 01:40:14,158
这倒是个好主意      是啊
This was a very clever idea.        Yeah.

1924
01:40:26,244 --> 01:40:27,541
他们走了
They're gone.

1925
01:40:28,947 --> 01:40:30,039
走吧
Let's go.

1926
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:45,956
他们是尼日利亚人 是啊 我都忘了他们了
They are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.

1927
01:40:53,672 --> 01:40:55,290
这是条捷径      你在开玩笑吧?
This is a shortcut.        Are you kidding me?

1928
01:40:55,293 --> 01:40:56,601
你过不去的
You cannot go down there.

1929
01:41:04,115 --> 01:41:05,605
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1930
01:41:11,823 --> 01:41:12,915
撞他!
Hit him!

1931
01:41:20,632 --> 01:41:22,297
我们在哪儿呢?      切尔西码头
Where are we?        Chelsea Pier.

1932
01:41:28,473 --> 01:41:29,565
不是吧?
What the hell?

1933
01:41:30,909 --> 01:41:32,303
天啊!
Jesus!

1934
01:41:39,351 --> 01:41:41,402
他们那架直升飞机绝对是作弊
Them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.

1935
01:41:41,953 --> 01:41:43,011
快走!
Go!

1936
01:41:48,159 --> 01:41:49,251
快跑!
Come on!

1937
01:41:51,129 --> 01:41:53,287
我们是警察! 打那架直升飞机!
We're cops! Hit the chopper!

1938
01:42:15,620 --> 01:42:17,326
我们是马丁和佛西 已在路上
This is Martin and Fosse, en route. 

1939
01:42:17,327 --> 01:42:19,013
都退后! 这是我们的逮捕行动!
Back off! This is our collar!

1940
01:42:20,325 --> 01:42:23,177
拉起防线 在我们赶到前不准采取逮捕行动!
Set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!

1941
01:42:23,295 --> 01:42:24,853
把警灯打开!
Take the light!

1942
01:42:44,549 --> 01:42:46,143
不要批准那项转账
Do not authorize that transfer.

1943
01:42:46,184 --> 01:42:48,042
这是大卫·厄森 这帐是为他转的
This is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.

1944
01:42:48,043 --> 01:42:50,322
他会让你不要授权的 快说
He will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.

1945
01:42:50,355 --> 01:42:53,273
快说!      对 照他们说的做 停止转账
Tell him!        Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.

1946
01:42:53,278 --> 01:42:54,125
不要停
Approve it.

1947
01:42:55,593 --> 01:42:56,685
就现在
Now.

1948
01:42:56,761 --> 01:42:58,762
什么都不要动!
Do not touch anything!

1949
01:42:58,763 --> 01:43:01,027
我对天发誓 我会打得你脑袋满桌子滚
I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.

1950
01:43:01,099 --> 01:43:03,600
这房间里没人信你会开枪打他
Not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.

1951
01:43:03,601 --> 01:43:04,693
是吗?
Yeah?

1952
01:43:06,071 --> 01:43:09,563
非常感谢你们把厄森先生送过来
Thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

1953
01:43:09,674 --> 01:43:13,075
我有两笔投资商的竞价
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.

1954
01:43:13,778 --> 01:43:16,308
它们值三千万美金 还未到账
They're at 30 million, and holding.

1955
01:43:16,715 --> 01:43:18,683
等一下! 你就不能让我...      把他带走
Wait! Can't you let me...        Take him away.

1956
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,774
但是计算机
But computers.

1957
01:43:21,954 --> 01:43:26,355
如果有一天它们被控制了会怎么样?
What if, one day, they were in charge?

1958
01:43:27,926 --> 01:43:32,322
如果你现在不闭嘴 我会用黄油刀割掉你的耳朵
Now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.

1959
01:43:32,323 --> 01:43:34,490
那很钝 钝的比锋利的还糟糕
That's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.

1960
01:43:34,491 --> 01:43:35,527
就现在!
Now!

1961
01:43:42,574 --> 01:43:43,734
你就站那儿别动!
You just stood there!

1962
01:43:43,842 --> 01:43:46,706
我不明白"现在"指的是什么 我要怎么知道啊?
I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?

1963
01:43:46,711 --> 01:43:48,576
我知道是什么意思      闭嘴
I knew what that meant.        Shut up.

1964
01:43:48,680 --> 01:43:51,706
你杀了我们就杀了厄森 你就拿不到那三千万了
You kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.

1965
01:43:51,783 --> 01:43:53,876
现在是谁占上风 啊?      对啊
Who's got the golden goose now, huh?        Yeah.

1966
01:43:57,922 --> 01:43:59,514
见鬼!
Shit!

1967
01:44:00,191 --> 01:44:02,742
他就算中了枪也还是有利用价值的
He's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.

1968
01:44:02,743 --> 01:44:04,292
他马上就看穿你的把戏了
He immediately called your bluff.

1969
01:44:04,396 --> 01:44:06,277
起来 杀了那些警察
Get up. And kill the police.

1970
01:44:06,297 --> 01:44:08,024
我好像还搞不清状况
I just wanna make sure I get it right.

1971
01:44:08,025 --> 01:44:11,317
你是要批准转账呢还是不批准呢?
Did you want this transfer approved or not approved?

1972
01:44:11,736 --> 01:44:14,102
你 伙计 我打算杀你练练枪
You, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.

1973
01:44:15,640 --> 01:44:18,438
警察 不许动! 放下你的武器!
Police, don't move! Drop your weapons!

1974
01:44:18,543 --> 01:44:21,478
要么放下武器 要么横着出去 老弟!
Drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!

1975
01:44:21,546 --> 01:44:24,841
我希望监狱的饭菜和男人能合你胃口
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.

1976
01:44:24,882 --> 01:44:27,346
警察! 跪地上别动!      把手举起来!
Police! Down on the ground!        Let me see your hands!

1977
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:37,526
嘿 嘿 你还好吧?      嘿
Hey, hey, you okay?        Hey.

1978
01:44:38,430 --> 01:44:41,046
嘿 吉恩 长官 很抱歉
Hey, Gene. Captain. I'm sorry.

1979
01:44:41,099 --> 01:44:42,844
抱歉      没事 别担心
I'm sorry.        That's okay. Don't worry about it.

1980
01:44:42,867 --> 01:44:44,466
我们不在办公室的时候你可以叫我吉恩
You can call me Gene when we're not in the office.

1981
01:44:44,836 --> 01:44:47,240
好的 谢谢你能来
Okay. Thanks for coming by.

1982
01:44:47,288 --> 01:44:49,131
好小子
Attaboy.

1983
01:44:49,207 --> 01:44:51,607
别这样 听我说 听我说
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.

1984
01:44:51,607 --> 01:44:54,453
他快不行了! 他快不行了! 他快死了!
We're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!

1985
01:44:54,846 --> 01:44:57,318
不不不 我只是在休息 
No. No, no, no, no. I'm just resting. 

1986
01:44:57,319 --> 01:44:58,836
我刚只是在休息
I'm just resting.

1987
01:44:58,871 --> 01:45:00,511
抱歉 我伤到你了吗?      我刚只是在休息
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?        I'm just resting.

1988
01:45:00,518 --> 01:45:02,042
你还好吧?      只是休息一下
Are you all right?        Just resting.

1989
01:45:02,153 --> 01:45:03,956
嘿 告诉你件事
Hey, let me tell you something.

1990
01:45:03,956 --> 01:45:06,880
文案工作我们会帮忙做好的
As far as paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.

1991
01:45:06,881 --> 01:45:08,383
你知道为什么吗?      为什么?
You know why?        Why?

1992
01:45:08,493 --> 01:45:09,983
"那是我们的荣幸"
Ain't too proud to beg.

1993
01:45:10,628 --> 01:45:11,822
少来了
Come on.

1994
01:45:11,896 --> 01:45:14,068
怎么了?      不是那么好笑了
What?        It's not funny anymore.

1995
01:45:14,068 --> 01:45:16,457
不知道你在说什么      TLC的歌名
I don't know what you're talking about.        TLC references.

1996
01:45:16,468 --> 01:45:18,801
啥都不知道 我向你发誓
Still nothing. I swear to you.

1997
01:45:18,803 --> 01:45:20,660
我要去那边看看特里 
I'm gonna go over and check on Terry. 

1998
01:45:21,415 --> 01:45:23,919
我膝盖不太好 稳住 去啦
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.

1999
01:45:24,209 --> 01:45:27,007
这真是傻瓜案子之最
It was the king of the mutt cases,

2000
01:45:27,078 --> 01:45:30,505
但是艾伦和特里却视之如宝
but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.

2001
01:45:33,215 --> 01:45:36,312
24小时都在调查厄森的阴谋
Within 24 hours of learning about Ershon's scheme

2002
01:45:36,321 --> 01:45:38,443
和兰道公司的巨大损失
and Lendl's massive losses,

2003
01:45:38,444 --> 01:45:41,603
政府启动问题资产救助计划出资帮助兰道
the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.

2004
01:45:41,603 --> 01:45:44,234
兰道涉及各个领域 
Lendl is in everything, 

2005
01:45:44,235 --> 01:45:46,012
我们会将产业扩展到各地...
and we're gonna go everywhere...

2006
01:45:46,013 --> 01:45:47,465
出资巨大不容失败
They were too big to fail.

2007
01:45:47,765 --> 01:45:53,275
厄森现在身处佛罗里达巴洛米诺联邦教养所
Ershon now resides in Palomino Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.

2008
01:45:53,275 --> 01:45:56,097
他还在投资 只是货币有所不同
He still invests. Currency's just different.

2009
01:45:57,175 --> 01:45:59,575
罗杰·韦斯利与比曼的谋杀案有关
Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman murder

2010
01:45:59,677 --> 01:46:03,477
马丁和佛西未检查的监控录像
by security cam footage which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.

2011
01:46:03,548 --> 01:46:05,379
只拍到了他们的后脑勺
It only showed the back of their heads.

2012
01:46:05,483 --> 01:46:07,236
但是艾伦的"人人后脑勺"程序
But Allen's Faceback app 

2013
01:46:07,237 --> 01:46:09,722
却将他们的正脸与录像对上了

2028
01:46:49,727 --> 01:46:51,517
当局游说者动用数百万美元

2029
01:46:51,517 --> 01:46:54,152

I told you!        They knew by putting someone like you

2033
01:47:03,208 --> 01:47:04,963
一个动辄就开枪的人

2034
01:47:04,964 --> 01:47:06,178
在赛前通道
where I do my pre-game walk,

2035

一定会出事 果真我俩都倒霉了
it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.

The whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.

2042
01:47:22,927 --> 01:47:26,248
新闻却只字不提 那是因为谁是这幕后主使?
And the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?

2043
01:47:26,331 --> 01:47:29,078
和政府幕后相同的人
The same corporations that own the government.

2044
01:47:29,367 --> 01:47:31,062
法庭和法律是我们唯一剩下的途径了

2057

What was that?        What?

2058
01:48:10,808 --> 01:48:14,437

What? Dude, what is it with you and hot ladies? What's your secret?

2059
01:48:14,512 --> 01:48:17,174
老实说 我不知道你在说什么
Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.

2060
01:48:17,282 --> 01:48:19,307
告诉我你把你的处子之身献给了谁
Tell me who you lost your virginity to.

2061

2063
01:48:24,536 --> 01:48:25,916
你听说过她?      不是吧!
You've heard of her?        Come on!

2064
01:48:25,990 --> 01:48:27,732
她过去还要丰满
She was much chubbier back then.

2065
01:48:28,015 --> 01:48:30,615
我想不通 我真是想不通啊
 I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.

2066
01:48:31,115 --> 01:48:51,115

2067
01:53:30,695 --> 01:53:32,356
是你 你没什么幽默感
That was you. You don't have a sense of humor.

2068
01:53:32,463 --> 01:53:34,644
我有... 我不要太有幽默感哦
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.

2069
01:53:34,644 --> 01:53:36,008
如果你说些好玩的东西 我会笑
If you say something funny, I'll laugh.

2070
01:53:36,008 --> 01:53:37,656
好吧 我要给你讲个很好玩的笑话
All right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke.

2071
01:53:37,657 --> 01:53:39,097
来吧 我喜欢笑话
Please. I love jokes.

2072
01:53:39,132 --> 01:53:41,713
好的 有个小男孩过13岁生日了
All right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.

2073
01:53:42,873 --> 01:53:46,126
是时候破处了      有点不是时候啊
It's time to get laid.        Already feels inappropriate.

2074
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:48,534
于是他找到妓院里的小姐 他说"小姐"
So he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, " Miss,

2075
01:53:48,534 --> 01:53:50,363
"瞧 我知道你通常要收钱 
"look, I know usually you want money,

2076
01:53:50,364 --> 01:53:52,130
"但我没钱 今天又是我的生日"
"but I don't have any money and it's my birthday.

2077
01:53:52,131 --> 01:53:54,027
"我能给你这只鸭子然后跟你上床吗?"
"Do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?"

2078
01:53:54,251 --> 01:53:56,589
他是个农民?      不是
Was he a farmer?        No.

2079
01:53:56,654 --> 01:53:59,175
他可能会违反了健康法 
That's probably a Health Code violation, 

2080
01:53:59,176 --> 01:54:01,198
带只鸭子上妓院
bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.

2081
01:54:01,198 --> 01:54:03,040
他们不是和那只鸭子上床!
They weren't gonna have sex with the duck!

2082
01:54:03,227 --> 01:54:05,410
不 我是说带只鸭子上那种地方
No, I just mean Health Code violation

2083
01:54:05,410 --> 01:54:08,783
违抗了健康法规
to have the duck brought into a facility like that.

2084
01:54:10,167 --> 01:54:12,478
不管怎样 她说"可以"
So, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it. "

2085
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:15,504
所以他做了 把第一次献给了她
So he goes in there, gives it to her.

2086
01:54:15,873 --> 01:54:17,169
献给她什么?
He gives her what?

2087
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:19,287
就是又挺又粗的那个 她爱极了
The high, hard one! She loves it.

2088
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:20,543
她接着说 "你知道吗? 
She goes, " You know what? 

2089
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:22,803
"如果你再做一次 我会把你的鸭子还给你"
"If you do that again, I'll give you your duck back. "

2090
01:54:22,803 --> 01:54:25,271
所以就是免费上床两次      呃... 抱歉
It's like getting laid twice for free.        So... I'm sorry.

2091
01:54:25,272 --> 01:54:26,110
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

2092
01:54:26,323 --> 01:54:30,019
那只鸭子是用来付上床的钱的      是的是的
The duck is payment for sexual intercourse.        Yes. Yes.

2093
01:54:30,187 --> 01:54:31,347
很好      他用鸭子付款
Very good.        He used the duck as payment,

2094
01:54:31,422 --> 01:54:33,294
现在他又能把鸭子要回来
and now he's being paid back the duck.

2095
01:54:33,457 --> 01:54:35,913
他说"哦 天哪 这是我最棒的生日了" 
He goes, " Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever. " 

2096
01:54:35,914 --> 01:54:36,750
他又做了一次
He does it again.

2097
01:54:36,861 --> 01:54:38,516
然后他走回家了 走走走...
Now he's walking home, right? Walking...

2098
01:54:38,517 --> 01:54:40,759
所以她对鸭子很满意
So she was satisfied with duck.

2099
01:54:40,760 --> 01:54:42,922
鸭子当做货币...      是的
With a duck as currency...        Yes.

2100
01:54:42,923 --> 01:54:45,468
给她 很棒 很好
...to her. Great. Good.

2101
01:54:45,603 --> 01:54:46,823
他走回家去 
So he's walking home, 

2102
01:54:46,824 --> 01:54:49,639
现在他迫不及待想要回去告诉他爸爸
now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?

2103
01:54:49,817 --> 01:54:52,018
他和鸭子沿着街道走 突然间 轰的一声
He's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom,

2104
01:54:52,042 --> 01:54:53,697
来了辆货车 撞倒了他的鸭子
truck comes by and runs over his duck.

2105
01:54:53,697 --> 01:54:55,193
把鸭子杀了?      杀了
Kills the duck?        Killed the duck.

2106
01:54:55,193 --> 01:54:57,300
所以那只鸭子死了      它死了
So the duck is now dead.        The duck is dead.

2107
01:54:57,548 --> 01:54:59,856
那个孩子开始哭泣 货车司机停下了 
The kid starts crying, truck driver stops, 

2108
01:54:59,758 --> 01:55:01,665
他很烦心 他不是故意的...      他当然会哭了
he's all upset, he didn't mean...        Of course he's crying!

2109
01:55:01,666 --> 01:55:04,297
他是个13岁的孩子 才发生过两次性交
He's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice,

2110
01:55:04,321 --> 01:55:06,503
他看着自己挚爱的鸭子死掉
and he watched his beloved duck die.

2111
01:55:06,504 --> 01:55:07,930
你能闭嘴让我把故事讲完吗?
Will you shut up and let me tell the story?

2112
01:55:07,958 --> 01:55:10,058
目前为止 我还不明白这个故事会怎么个幽默法
So far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.

2113
01:55:10,161 --> 01:55:12,211
那伙计对于弄死那只鸭子感到很抱歉 
The guy feels so bad about killing the duck,

2114
01:55:12,212 --> 01:55:13,198
他给了他两块钱
 he gives him two dollars.

2115
01:55:13,233 --> 01:55:14,678
那孩子高兴了吗?
And the kid's happy with the two bucks?

2116
01:55:14,832 --> 01:55:16,795
他狂喜不止! 他上床了两次 
He's ecstatic! He got laid twice, 

2117
01:55:16,796 --> 01:55:18,599
现在他又得到了两块钱
and now he's got two dollars on top of it.

2118
01:55:18,634 --> 01:55:21,256
听上去一只鸭子远比两块钱有价值得多
Seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.

2119
01:55:22,006 --> 01:55:23,530
死了就不值钱了
This was a while back. You what I'm...

2120
01:55:23,941 --> 01:55:26,432
于是他到了家 他爸爸问 "发生什么事了?"
So he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?

2121
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:27,583
"告诉我! 告诉我!" 
"Tell me! Tell me!" 

2122
01:55:27,915 --> 01:55:30,443
他说"爸爸 我用鸭子上了床"
He goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck,

2123
01:55:30,478 --> 01:55:31,638
"我又上床拿回了鸭子"
"I got a duck for the fuck,

2124
01:55:31,716 --> 01:55:34,259
"拿回了鸭子换来了两块钱!"
"and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!"

2125
01:55:36,554 --> 01:55:37,782
这像是打油诗
So it's like a limerick.

2126
01:55:38,989 --> 01:55:40,217
你觉得不好笑吗?
You didn't think that was funny?

2127
01:55:40,691 --> 01:55:42,806
我觉得最后还是蛮娱乐大众的 确实是
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure,

2128
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:45,095
把所有的词都串在一起
the way all the words were put together,

2129
01:55:45,096 --> 01:55:46,804
但是从内容上来说?
but in terms of content?

2130
01:55:48,299 --> 01:55:49,391
不好笑
No.

2131
01:55:52,603 --> 01:55:56,232
结完账咱走人吧
Get the check-check from Shen-Shen. Let's get out of here.

2132
01:56:01,445 --> 01:56:06,013
别这样 你搞嘛啊
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

2133
01:56:06,117 --> 01:56:07,141
卡
And cut.
