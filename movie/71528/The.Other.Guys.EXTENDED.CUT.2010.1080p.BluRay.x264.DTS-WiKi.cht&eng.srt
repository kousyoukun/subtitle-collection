3
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,749
在紐約 法律與混亂有明顯的界限
In New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.

4
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,615
在那條界限上的是丹森和海史密斯
On that line live Danson and Highsmith.

5
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,348
再說一遍我為什麼要爬上車頂!
Tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!

6
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,730
我覺得你可以歸罪於錯誤的人生選擇
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.

7
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,040
幹掉那個混蛋
Get rid of that asshole.

8
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,083
啊哦      我討厭你說"啊哦"
Uh-oh!        I hate it when you say "uh-oh!"

9
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,761
老兄 你身手真敏捷!
Dude, you put a ding in my hood!

10
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,658
放馬過來啊!
Come on with it, then!

11
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,280
麻煩了
That's trouble.

12
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,573
誰打了九夭夭嗎?
Did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?

13
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,678
到此結束了 我厭倦了逃來逃去
That's it. I'm sick of all this running.

14
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,680
抓緊了!
Hang on!

15
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:53,072
你有權保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent!

16
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,200
但我想聽你尖叫!
But I wanna hear you scream!

17
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,783
臥倒!
Down on the ground!

18
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,287
探員 嘿 探員
Detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!

19
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,021
一個個來 好不好?
One at a time, all right?

20
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,956
探員們 我是雷克·格雷森 
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,

來自紐約觀察者網的記者
 New York Observer Online.

22
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,436
這些嫌犯被逮捕時只發現持有0.25磅的大麻
These suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana,

23
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,937
在一些州只算輕罪
a misdemeanor in some states.

24
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,475
你認為這次造成1200萬損失的逮捕行動值得嗎?
Do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?

25
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,707
為什麼不讓紐約回答這個問題?
Why don't we let New York City answer that question?

26
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,271
這是世界上最好的城市!
The greatest city on Earth, yeah!

27
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,819
你好 來自TMZ出版社的莎拉·加夫尼
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.

28
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,483
丹森 你和金姆·卡丹森的緋聞是真的嗎?
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?

29
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,151
我不做評論
No comment.

30
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,993
但 是的
But, yes.

31
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,056
丹森和海史密斯 終生都有免費熱狗吃!
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!

32
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,668
但飲料不免費 我不能虧太多啊
No drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.

33
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,210
丹森和海史密斯無論射擊 開車 做愛都有型 
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style.

34
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,471
他們是明星
 They're rock stars.

35
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,573
然後才輪到講笑話的 打球的 獸醫
Then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets...

36
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,585
和二流人物
...and the other guys.

37
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,516
我們知道 我們知道 我們知道
We know, we know. We know.

38
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,788
好好好 聽我說! 聽我說!
All right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!

39
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,423
今晚我們在巴特酒店開慶祝會
We're having a celebration tonight at Butter.

40
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,093
布羅迪·珍妮會去 還有白靈
Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.

41
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,966
來自澤西海岸的小婊子      耶!
That little short bitch from Jersey Shore.        Yeah!

42
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,532
你們大部分都被邀請了
And most of you are on the list.

43
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,142
你們最棒
You're the best.

44
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,178
同志們 我現在有話要說
Guys, I'm gonna say something right now.

45
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,645
關於一個來自奧地利的有夢想的人
It's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.

46
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,547
阿諾·施瓦辛格!      讓我說完
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        Let me finish.

47
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,017
他先成為冠軍後來做了影星 懂嗎?
He became a champion and then a movie star, all right?

48
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,281
阿諾·施瓦辛格!      該死 讓我說...
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        God damn it, let me...

49
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,289
你毀了這故事 你毀了這故事
They ruined the story. They ruined the story.

50
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,984
重要的是
Let...What...The point is,

51
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,701
我們沒有今天的成就 
we couldn't do our job

52
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,154
如果沒有你們做文書工作
if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork,

53
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,527
接電話 還有其他我們不願做的事
answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do.

54
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,622
那些槍戰 那些追捕行動
all the gun fights all the car chases

55
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,568
那些我們本不想卻又不得不上的女人
all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to,

56
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,334
都是因為有了你們 謝謝
all due to what you guys do. Thank you.

57
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,670
而且我們週而復始地做著
And we'd do it again and again.

58
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,040
閉上你的臭嘴
Hey, you shut your face!

59
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,339
如果你要講話
If we wanna hear you talk,

60
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,314
我就把手從你屁眼埵鬤i去 然後把你當木偶耍!
I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!

61
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,074
聽到了沒? 聽到了沒?
You hear me? You hear me?

62
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,551
酒吧見      對
Cash bar.        Yeah.

63
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,484
老實點 混蛋們
Peace out, bitches.

64
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,825
好 夥計們 靠近點
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.

65
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,383
來吧 靠近點
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

66
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,652
對 這奡N行了
All right, right there.

67
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,698
後退 就站在這
Just back up, just like right there.

68
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,392
好 再退...再前進...
All right, just one...Just a...

69
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,230
對對對 就是這 就是這
There you go, right there. Right there.

70
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,896
這是他們的文書工作 你們知道他們不會做的
This is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.

71
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,203
沒錯 這些文書工作就像鮑勃的老婆
That's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.

72
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,939
又厚又無趣 滿是丹森的指紋
It's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.

73
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,445
無冒犯之意 鮑勃      沒關係
No offense, Bob.        That's all right.

74
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,675
無論如何 誰要做?      我要!
Anyway, now who wants it?        I do!

75
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,712
好的 這活給文書獃子和揚基剪子了!
All right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!

76
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,006
好好幹 謝謝 艾倫      謝謝長官
Nice work. Thanks, Allen.        Thank you, Captain.

77
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:56,950
"給我做 給我做"
"I'll do it! I'll do it!"

78
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,126
別再哼那個歌啦!
Stop humming that song!

79
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,961
我想哼就哼      不 我知道你想
I can hum if I want to.        No, I know you can.

80
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,300
但我偏要你停
I'm asking you to stop.

81
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,632
如果你要求的話 我就停      謝謝
Well, if you're asking, then I'll stop.        Thank you.

82
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,740
你可不可以不那樣笑?
Could you not smile like that?

83
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,432
你因為自己的感情
Now you're asking me to mask my emotions 

84
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,751
而要求我掩飾我的感情
because of how it makes you feel.

85
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,551
我才不幹呢
That I will not do.

86
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,226
說真的 不要再哼了 好嗎?
Seriously, stop humming! Okay?

87
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,320
這不是財會統計
This isn't accounting or wherever the hell

88
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,764
你別以為用你的小計算器就能搞定
you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.

89
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,103
法務會計 好不好 這工作很重要的
Forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.

90
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:45,844
隨你便 
Yeah, whatever. 

91
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:48,966
做這種垃圾工作就別屁顛屁顛的啦 你個傻帽
Stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.

92
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,940
同志們 提醒一下
Hey, guys. Reminder.

93
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,241
警署的野餐聚會將在週末舉辦
The police union picnic's coming up this weekend.

94
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,943
我老婆要做拿手菜芥末蛋 我的肚子又要撐大嘍
My wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.

95
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,417
現在不該說那個 鮑勃
It's a bad time, Bob!

96
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,515
好吧
All right.

97
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,182
去吃塊蛋糕
Going to get a slice.

98
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,633
你知道我剛才看到什麼了?
You know what I just did?

99
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,002
我一出門 就看到一些探員
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives,

100
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,598
他們馬上就要在你背後說壞話了
and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back,

101
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,871
但是我沒有說你壞話 因為我爸媽教我
but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me

102
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,606
在背後說別人壞話的人是懦夫
that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.

103
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,875
哇 我很感激
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

104
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,779
好 因為我要當面說你的壞話
Good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.

105
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,615
不 你不必        不 我不喜歡你
No. You don't have to.        No, I don't like you.

106
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,120
我覺得你不是真警察
I think you're a fake cop.

107
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,955
你小便時候的聲音 聽起來跟個娘們似的
The sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.

108
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,790
如果在野外 我會攻擊你的
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

109
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,670
哪怕你不在我的食物鏈 
Even if you weren't in my food chain, 

110
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,562
我也會破例把你給宰了
I would go out of my way to attack you.

111
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,225
如果我是雄獅 你是個金槍魚
If I were a lion, and you were a tuna,

112
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,929
我會游在海中把你吃掉
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!

113
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,397
然後上你的女友
And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

114
00:07:55,508 --> 00:08:00,242
首先 怎麼會有會游泳的獅子?
Okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?

115
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,256
獅子不喜歡水
Lions don't like water.

116
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,714
你硬把它放在河流或者淡水的旁邊 
If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source,

117
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,550
倒是行得通
 that'd make sense.

118
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,883
但假使你在海中 二十英尺高的巨浪
But you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,

119
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,717
我說的是在南非的海域
I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa,

120
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,329
遇到一個八百磅的成年金槍魚 
coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna 

121
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,357
還有他的二三十個朋友
with his 20 or 30 friends?

122
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,588
你必死無疑
You lose that battle.

123
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,597
你十有八九會死的 你知道嗎?
You lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?

124
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,058
如果你膽敢進入金槍魚群 
You've wandered into our school of tuna,

125
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,966
我們就可以嘗到獅子的味道了
 and we now have a taste of lion.

126
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,470
我們和自己講話 我們交談
We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.

127
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,732
是嗎      然後說"你知道嗎?
Yeah?        And said, " You know what?

128
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,970
"獅子味道不錯 我們再去吃幾個吧"
"Lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion. "

129
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,637
我們就會在灘頭建立一個基地
We've developed a system to establish a beachhead

130
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,647
然後蠶食你的整個族群
and aggressively hunt you and your family.

131
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,910
我們會奪走你的驕傲
And we will corner your pride,

132
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,885
你的孩子 你的後代      你怎麼做?
your children, your offspring.        How you gonna do that?

133
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,748
我們會用海草做一套呼吸裝置
We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.

134
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,115
用來吸收一些氧氣
We will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.

135
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,866
一次雖然不能上岸幾天 
It's not gonna be days at a time, 

136
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:52,004
但一兩個小時絕對沒問題
but an hour, hour 45, no problem.

137
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,426
這樣我們就可以找出你住在哪
That will give us enough time to figure out where you live,

138
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,894
回到海洋 攝入更多氧氣 然後再跟蹤你
go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.

139
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:01,562
你搬石頭砸自己的腳 我們武器 人數都比你們多
You just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and outmanned.

140
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,238
你開始是這麼想的嗎?
Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?

141
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,439
不
Nope.

142
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,614
在開市的兩分鐘前

Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global, 

144
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,140
將按鈴宣佈市場開放
ringing the opening bell.

145
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,628
博德曼旁邊的是投資銀行家  大衛·厄森

who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.

147
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,099
我們虧損了多少?
How much did we lose?

148
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,967
現在您可以按鈴了 博德曼女士
You may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.

149

$32.        Million?

150
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,537

151
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,478
去你的!
Shit!

152
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,650
唐人街的三個黑幫痞子 我幹掉了兩個
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.

153
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,513
崩崩      好
Bang, bang.        Yeah.

154
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,512
然後我站起來幹掉他們的老大
Then I raise up to take the leader out.

155
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:50,812
媽呀 我好像身臨其境
Shit, I feel like I'm there now.

156
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,585
我聽到口哨聲 我的搭檔在屋頂
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.

157
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,490
他說"讓我們為民除害"
He says, "Let's even the odds!"

158
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,993
他把用步槍把我擊倒 我直接一槍穿膛將他打死
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.

159
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,557
遊戲結束了 混蛋們
Game over, bitches.

160
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,332
好了      好

161
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:12,436
吉米? 說說那個故事令你感覺如何?
Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.

162
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,001
好像我的下體是用混凝土做的
Like my cock was made out of concrete.

163
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,248
我知道你很勇敢
I know it's very tempting.

164

你想令朋友們印象深刻
You want to impress your friends.

165

但是我們說的是嚴肅的問題 好不好?
But this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?

166
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,859
要按照職責使用武器
This is firing your weapon in the line of duty.

167
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,949
霍茲警員?

你想分享你的故事嗎?
Would you like to share?

171
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,656
不 算了吧
No, I'd rather not.

172
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,399
霍茲警員 你來警署六個月了
Officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now,

173
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,264
始終一言不發
and you haven't said a word.

174
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,702
這堳靬M諧的 沒人會對你說三道四
This is a safe room, no judgment here.

175
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,864
蠢蛋
Jerkoff.

176
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,238
你在評論別人 吉米 說吧
That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

177
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,835
我每晚都會想起
I relive it every night.

178
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,112
布朗克斯區 十月

For all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, 

181
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,348
我在一個隧道堸黧
and I pulled tunnel duty.

182
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,552
我在隧道看到一個黑影 我警告他停下來
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.

183
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:58,255

Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!

184

最後還是拿出槍來
Finally pulled my gun.

185
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,056
拿出一個致命武器 他向我跑來
Pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.

186
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,027
不要讓我開槍! 我會的!
Don't make me shoot! I'll do it!

187
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,328
你聾了嗎? 我說了"不許動"
Are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?

188
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:09,360
你個混蛋! 我是德塈J·傑特 你擊中我了!
You dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!

You cost me 20 grand on that game!        Douche bag.

190

紐約失去了一座冠軍啊
Cost the city a championship.

191

我本來要被提拔到兇殺組的高層
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.

192

每個人都叫我揚基剪子
Everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.

194

因為你射中了德塈J·傑特
Because you shot Derek Jeter!

195

他可是雙族天使
He's a biracial angel.

196
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,975
你應該向A羅德開槍
You should've shot A-Rod.

197
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,955
嗨 文書獃子

我知道你們覺得有趣 但我不喜歡
I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.

They were like, " How come you've never 

209
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:53,794
沒有用過武器?
fired your weapon in the office before?"

210
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:54,794

Good point.

211

Fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.

215
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,981
才沒有呢      我不笨
Not true.        I'm not stupid.

我們很尊重你 
We honor the flag, 

219
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:12,425
你要是不開槍你就對不起我們
and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.

220
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,890

No, that's not real!

232
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:41,082
他們很有說服力啊 他們騙了我!
They were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.

233
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,927
好吧艾倫 你必須交出槍來
All right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.

You can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?

257
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,680
我是個孔雀 我要飛
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!

258
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,057
他剛剛管自己叫孔雀?
Did he just...Did he just call himself a peacock?

259
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,829
走吧 走吧
Let's go! Let's go!

260
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,930
放馬來吧
Come on, fellas!

261
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,573
週三晚上去萊克島監獄吃玉米卷吧!
Wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!

262
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:52,749
那是本周第二個了!
That's the second one this week!

263
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,417
你們這些小兔崽子! 不要跑!
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!

264
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,221
快走!
Let's go!

265
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,121
好
Yeah!

266
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,892
抬頭!
Heads up!

267
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,307
該死
Shit.

268
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,840
特種部隊高空滑行
Special Forces zipline.

269
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,913
切掉那根線 切掉! 我們走!
Cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!

270
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,417
這些歹徒是專家      我們上
These guys are pros.        Let's go!

271
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,888
你和我想的一樣 搭檔?
You thinking what I'm thinking, partner?

272
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,583
朝著灌木叢跳
Aim for the bushes.

273
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,849
警察們還在討論為何丹森和海史密斯跳了下去
Cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.

274
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,916
也許是因為驕傲 那麼多次死堸k生
Maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.

275
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,155
也許是他們太自負了
Maybe their egos pushed them off.

276
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,959
我不知道 但他們真瘋狂
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.

277
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,167
無論如何 紐約出現了一個洞 
Either way, there was a hole in New York City, 

278
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,766
需要人來填滿
and it needed to be filled.

279
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,135
兩天前 紐約哭了
Two days ago, this city wept.

280
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,165
我們失去了奉獻了一切的兩名英雄
We lost two heroes who gave everything for us,

281
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,444
他們最後的犧牲 
who paid that ultimate sacrifice

282
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,881
也是為了我們能夠安全地走在馬路上
 so that we may walk these streets safely.

283
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,674
他們跳下去的地方連一個遮雨棚都沒有
There wasn't even an awning in their direction.

284
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,945
不 我知道      他們從二十樓跳了下來
No, I know.        They just jumped 20 stories.

285
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,351
這不符合邏輯 對嗎?
Doesn't make sense, does it?

286
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,323
我只希望上帝可以讓他們把警察配槍帶到天堂
I only hope God lets them take their. 357s with them to heaven.

287
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,663
我們的時代來臨了 艾倫 
It's our moment, Allen. 

288
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,726
我們代替他倆的時代來臨了
Our moment to step up and be the guys.

289
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,891
我們還在葬禮上呢 給他們點尊重吧      什麼?
We're at a funeral. Show some respect.        What?

290
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,825
你不覺得每一個在場的警察
You don't think every other detective here

291
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,081
都在想同一件事嗎?
 isn't thinking the same thing?

292
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,501
艾倫 聽我說 丹森和海史密斯已經死了
Allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.

293
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,199
他們人去桌空 總得有人填補他們的職位
Their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.

294
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,837
那就是我們了好不好? 紐約現在急缺英雄
That someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.

295
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,670
是嗎?      是的
Is it?        Yeah.

296
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,378
那要是九百萬個有社交意識 有團隊精神的公民
What about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens,

297
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,215
都想要代替他們的位置怎麼辦?
all just stepping up and doing their part?

298
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,551
小時候 你沒有玩過警察抓小偷?
As a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?

299
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,817
我告訴你我小時候做過什麼吧
I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.

300
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,224
我去上學 整理床鋪
I went to school and made my bed.

301
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,922
十一歲時 我審查了我父母的賬本
And at age 11, I audited my parents.

302
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,330
我告訴你 事情出了點小差錯 我就被他們禁足了
And believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.

303
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,266
你是從哪來的怪胎啊?
What the hell are you?

304
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,338
喲喲喲 看看誰來了
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

305
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,109
看看這兩個傻蛋 
Look at these two jamokes, would you? 

306
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,503
一個射中了傑特 另一個在警署開槍
One shot Jeter and the other shot an office.

307
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,510
嘴巴乾淨點 我們還在參加葬禮呢
Have some decorum. We're at a funeral.

308
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,777
你要跳舞嗎 小樣?
You wanna dance, brolio?

309
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,693
我要用我的巨根爆你菊花
I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks. 

310
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,238
 讓你後庭流血
You'll be pissing blood out of your ass.

311
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,853
慘啊
That's horrible.

312
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:39,550
你靠那麼近幹嘛?
Why don't you step back, man?

313
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,092
你敢碰他 我對上帝發誓
You touch him, I swear to God

314
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,094
我會用艾倫的頭把你打得屁股開花
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.

315
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,920
他不會這麼做的 他只是虛張聲勢 不過有點怪異
He's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.

316
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,728
你想打架?      打就打!
You wanna go?        I wanna go!

317
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,299
打倒他      扁他 馬丁
Get him off.        Kick his ass, Martin.

318
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,130
這樣如何?
Yeah. How do you like that?

319
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,063
抓他頭髮      我喜歡
Pull his hair!        I love it.

320
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,935
這下可真疼
This hurts so good.

321
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,437
請節哀 女士      多高雅的帽子啊
Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.        What a lovely hat.

322
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:01,670
我愛你的鞋
I love your shoes.

323
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,771
好了好了      繼續 繼續
It's fine, it's fine.        Go, go.

324
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,542
教訓他!
Punish him!

325
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,642
哦 有沒搞錯
Oh, man.

326
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,288
就這樣 我們就是這樣做的
Do it. That's how we do it in the hood.

327
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,583
教訓他      根本就沒有這種動作
Punish him.        That's not even a move.

328
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,123
我贏了 我贏了 每個人都看到了
I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.

329
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,195
你們在搞什麼鬼?
What the hell is going on here?

330
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,321
兩個好人剛死
Two good men are dead,

331
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,792
你們就為了誰將繼承他們的輝煌而打架?
you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?

332
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:23,794
是這麼回事?
Is that what's happening?

333
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,626
是 就是這麼回事
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.

334
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,062
我告訴你
Let me tell you something.

335
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,671
請節哀 羅琳      請節哀
Sorry for your loss, Lorraine.        Very sorry.

336
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,476
請節哀 羅琳      請節哀 羅琳
Sorry, Lorraine.        Sorry, Lorraine.

337

你好 我叫吉米
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

338
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,175
太早了吧       你幹嘛說這個?
Too soon?        Why'd you say that?

339
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,341
我告訴你 這兩個人
I'll tell you something about those guys.

340
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,086
他們之所以是好警察 
They knew that to become a good cop, 

341
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,415
因為他們解決了很多案子 好不?
you had to solve cases. Okay?

342
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,088
好 也許你們可以從卡斯蒂失竊案開始
Okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.

343
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,757
好不好? 所以注意點
Okay? So just watch it.

344
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,931
下次我跟你在圖書館打
Next time, me, you, library.

345
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,159
甭想      來吧 夥計們
Not even close.        Come on, guys. Guys, come on.

346
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,836
你是...      我贏了!
You are...        I'm the winner!

347
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,080
我不需要你幫我強出頭 好嗎? 
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay? 

348
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,504
我可以自己解決
I could've handled that myself.

349
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,938
別自戀了 我們是搭檔麼 我別無選擇
Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.

350
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,272
走開
Move.

351
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,851
九點十五 祝大家度過美好的一天      閉嘴
9:15, let's have a great day, everybody!        Cut the shit!

352
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,659
早上好
Good morning.

353
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,833
有人開槍了 在西十街509號
We've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.

354
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,038
現場發現大量可卡因
There are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.

355
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,532
別惹麻煩了
Try to stay out of trouble, boys.

356
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,801
你肯定不會去那堛 對嗎?
There's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?

357
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,706
想也別想 太忙了
No chance. Too busy.

358
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,633
好吧 女生們 看到了沒? 
All right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?

359
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,529
這案子歸我們搞定了
 We're about to lock shit down.

360
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,606
沒錯      你們女生乖乖呆在這塈a
That's right.        You girls stay here and get your type on.

361
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,517
抓住他們 夥計們 能量多多 專注多多
Go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.

362
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:48,645
閉嘴!
Shut up!

363
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,514
艾倫 我可以在走廊跟你說幾句嗎?
Allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?

364
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:53,023
我...我現在超忙 特
I...I'm super busy right now, Terry.

365
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,491
不不不 我知道 很快說完
No, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.

366
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,425
是關於我們談過的建築工程批准令
It's about the construction permits you were talking about.

367
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,519
非法搭建腳手架?      這才是我們的案子
The scaffolding violations?        This is our thing, yeah.

368
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,723
你查到什麼了?
So, what do you got?

369
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,324
這個! 老實點
I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.

370
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,495
你幹什麼呢?
What are you doing?

371
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,267
走吧 我們去辦案
Let's go. We're going to that call.

372
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,231
你幹嘛?      閉嘴
What is this?        Shut up.

373
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,374
我們開車 我們要接辦這個案子
We're going to the car, and we're going after this case.

374
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,237
你不會向我開槍的      我不會?
You're not gonna shoot me.        I won't?

375
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,413
不會      我向傑特開過槍
No.        I shot Jeter.

376
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,675
那是個意外      是嗎?
That was an accident.        Was it?

377
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,273
快走      好吧
Now move.        Okay.

378
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,349
嘿
Hey.

379
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,617
看到沒有? 他用槍對著我
Does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.

380
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,520
我被綁架了
I'm being kidnapped.

381
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,686
這堿O警署啊 怎麼沒人感興趣?
Really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?

382
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,665
發生什麼了?      你說發生什麼了?
So, then what happened?        What do you think happened?

383
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,482
我醒來 解開脖子上的帶子 
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, 

384
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,215
然後上車去了那
and I got in my car, and I got out of there.

385
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:37,391
一個瘋狂的週末 對嗎?
Talk about a wild weekend, right?

386
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,768
我本來以為我要殺出去的
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.

387
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,033
你要做什麼呢? 受戒禮
What are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.

388
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,275
這是什麼?
What the hell is this?

389
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,075
是我的車 普銳斯
It's my car. It's a Prius.

390
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,811
感覺跟在陰道媥r車似的
I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.

391
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,752
霍茲探員和甘博警員在西十街518號
Detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.

392
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,915
別想 馬丁和佛西 出來兩分鐘了
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.

393
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,720
看看誰先到
We'll just see who's there first.

394
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,488
離犯罪現場遠點! 你聽到沒?
You stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?

395
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,220
快 快 快
Go, go, go!

396
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,327
感受到了嗎 艾倫? 蛋蛋是不是興奮了?
You feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?

397
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,498
肚子堶惘釭鷵斒厭漲b煽動翅膀?
Big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?

398
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,294
你確定你沒有前列腺癌?
Are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?

399
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,129
我知道這個可以讓你興奮起來
I got something to get you going.

400
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,136
我們去搞點破壞!
Let's go do some damage!

401
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,807
不
Nope.

402
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,309
這是什麼?
What the hell is that?

403
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,278
小河樂隊
LRB. Little River Band.

404
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,452
這音樂太娘們了
This music makes me feel like I'm going shopping for a training bra.

405
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,257
你知道嗎? 我們還是別聽音樂了 好不好?
You know what? We go with no music, okay?

406
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,451
好      說再見
Fine.        Say bye.

407
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,652
不不不 不要...
No, no, no, don't say bye...

408
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,456
你死定了 霍茲
You just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!

409
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,760
艾倫 你要是不踩加速器我就射你的腳!
Allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!

410
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,265
美國萬歲!
America!

411
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,865
艾倫 艾倫 踩剎車!
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!

412
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,935
真的 慢點開 我們快到犯罪現場了
Seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!

413
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:49,799
特 我來了
Terry, I'm coming in.

414
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,706
你會穿過那個帶子的 艾倫!
You're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!

415
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,477
老兄! 有沒...
Dude! What...

416
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,811
好多可卡因啊
That's a lot of cocaine.

417
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,979
你踩加速器的時候是不是喊道"美國萬歲"?
Did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?

418
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,653
沒 沒有
Nope. No. No.

419
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,691
我從沒像這樣
I've never actually put my foot all the way down

420
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,792
一腳踩到底過呢
to the ground with the accelerator like that.

421
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,164
我有點性奮了
It got me slightly aroused.

422
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,297
來了
Here we go.

423
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,833
等不及要到犯罪現場啊 夥計們
Way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.

424
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,346
普銳斯?      是的是的
Prius, huh?        Yep, yep.

425
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,676
省油吧?
Good mileage?

426
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,148
好著呢      對
Outstanding.        Yeah.

427
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,811
這堶惇O不是有牙科用膠布啊?
Did this come with a dental dam?

428
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,420
沒有      沒有麼?
No.        Get it?

429
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,892
昨晚我在一雪佛蘭上找到這玩意
My Suburban shit one of these last night.

430
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,926
我不知道他們在輪子上還放衛生棉呢
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.

431
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,356
我們玩得挺開心 是不?
We've had our fun, huh?

432
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,399
就好像疤面煞星朝你車上打了個噴嚏
Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.

433
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,259
好了 各位!
All right, everybody!

434
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,395
現在請你們後退 我們接手了
I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.

435
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,905
"我在犯罪現場 哈哈哈"
"At the crime scene, LOL."

436
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,702
我上圍脖通知一聲      謝謝
Good tweet, good tweet.        Yeah, thanks.

437
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,242
美國以資產過剩而出名
America has always been defined by its excess.

438
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,516
大峽谷有多餘的運動員契約
The Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.

439
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,018
溫蒂漢堡店有多餘的培根
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.

440
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:12,254
我自己有18輛蘭博基尼
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis

441
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,059
還有輛斯巴魯敞篷金龜車
and a Subaru station wagon.

442
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,261
就是因為資產過剩我才能奢侈揮霍
And it's because of this excess that I have flourished.

443
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,958
我懇求你們 不要停止賺取利潤
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.

444
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,764
過著資產過剩的日子 這才是美國的生活
Live for excess. It's the American way.

445
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,607
你好
Hello.

446
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,475
厄森先生? 您的電話
Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.

447
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,045
我是大衛
Sir David.

448
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,310
大衛 你沒回我電話 
David. You're not returning my calls, 

449
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,750
我想讓你見見羅傑·韋斯利
so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.

450
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,451
你好 夥計      你好
G'day, mate.        Hey.

451
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,157
羅傑和他的團隊會監督你 因為我不相信你
Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you,

452
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,884
我知道你會開溜
because I think you're going to take off.

453
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,095
帕米拉 真是荒謬 我哪堣]不會去
Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.

454
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,991
大衛 聽著 蘭道季刊在二十六號發行
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.

455
00:23:57,992 --> 00:23:59,293
如果你那時候不還我錢的話 
You have until then to give me my money. 

456
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:00,803
我就報告我的損失 大衛
I'm not reporting any losses, David.

457
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,816
我盯上了一個新投資者
I have zeroed in on a new investor.

458
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,834
那麼 你拿走他們的錢 
Well, then, you get their money,

459
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:05,904
然後讓它消失 再付給我們
 make it disappear, and then pay us back.

460
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,333
好好 我會告訴他不必盯緊我
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.

461
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,505
大衛!      好了 寶貝 再見
David!        Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.

462
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,985
她反應過度了 女人嘛 所以你可以走了
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.

463
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,513
我什麼都聽到了 夥計
Heard everything, mate.

464
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,881
女士們先生們
Ladies and gentlemen,

465
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,484
猜猜是誰告訴了我讓我賺十億元的秘密?
guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.

466
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,864
這位先生
That man there.

467
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,657
跟上! 跟上!
Go! Go!

468
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,799
靠邊      請靠邊
Side!        Step aside, please.

469
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,334
你認為我不算警察 是嗎?
You don't think I'm a real cop, do you?

470
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,670
不 我面對面跟你說了很多次了
No, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.

471
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,867
我很坦誠地對你說過了
I was really honest about that.

472
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,467
我在處理大案子 好不好?
I'm working on a huge case, all right?

473
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,672
一個名下有七處施工中房屋的地產商
Property owner with seven buildings under construction.

474
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
他連一個腳手架批准令都沒有
He hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.

475
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,460
根據百度知道 
Now, according to Ask Jeeves, 

476
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,374
這個嫌疑犯正在廣場酒店演講
this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.

477
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:53,718
這是所謂的大案子? 腳手架批准令?      對啊
That's your big case? Scaffolding permits?        Yeah.

478
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,055
知道嗎? 你要和我一起來
Guess what? You're coming with me.

479
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,729
這是把木槍
It's a wooden gun.

480
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,065
很疼啊
That hurts, man!

481
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,679
我總是有小河樂團的歌 
I've always got Little River Band loaded up here. 

482
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,207
我有六盤歌碟呢
I've got six disks in here.

483
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,505
克洛德 在外面見我 在咨詢台的後面
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.

484
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:16,747
我要坐新加坡航空
I'm flying Air Singapore.

485
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,543
嘿 道格拉斯 你妻子怎樣?      她死了
Hey, Douglas. How's the wife?        She died.

486
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,709
太好了!
Attaboy!

487
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,752
兩分鐘後到
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.

488
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,715
還有一件很討厭的事 你總是付零錢
Another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.

489
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,888
你只是嫉妒我的零錢包很好
You're just mad because I have a nice change purse.

490
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,085
你管那麼多幹啥?
Why do you even care?

491
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,129
我怎麼能不管? 你知道嗎? 你知道什麼更糟嗎?
How can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?

492
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,255
你放屁的方式 你連放屁都不像個男人
The way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.

493
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,458
真是荒謬
You're being ridiculous.

494
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,127
聽起來像小寶寶吹生日蠟燭
They sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.

495
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,533
什麼?      像...
What?        Like a little...

496
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,469
你知道你有什麼討人厭的地方嗎?      什麼?
You know what bugs me about you?        What?

497
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,104
我敢肯定你從來沒投過票
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.

498
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:46,307
不 我有過 體育電台 調頻880 本周最佳運動員
No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.

499
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,743
你就像一個穿著皮夾克的小孩 你就是像
You're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.

500
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,905
別擋路 夥計!
Get out of the way, man!

501
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,881
等等 你是大衛·厄森嗎?
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

502
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,248
是大衛·厄森先生 我其實也不在意你...
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...

503
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,585
其實 我在趕路 如果你們不介意的話 謝謝
Anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.

504
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,922
對不起 你被捕了 好不好?      什麼?
Excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay?        What?

505
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,930
你有權保持沉默 你所說的將被...
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used

506
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,125
後面是什麼?       用作懸浮設備
What's the next part?        As a floatation device.

507
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,724
用作懸浮設備
As a floatation device.

508
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,629
你知道嗎? 挺搞笑的 我還從來沒有抓過人呢
You know what? That's very funny. I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.

509
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,236
真的?      你們動真格的?
Really?        Are you guys for real?

510
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,400
我是不是撞到鬼了?
Am I being punk'd?

We arrest this jerkoff for a scaffolding permit?

519
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,161
等等 你們為什麼逮捕我?
Wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?

520
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,027
違反腳手架批准令
For scaffolding permit violation...

Couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate.        What?

526
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,276
別讓他們帶走我
Do not let these men take me.

527
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,144
你好
Hi.

528
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,778
她為什麼這樣看著我?
Why's she looking at you like that?

529
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,346
那是我的車!
That's my car!

530

I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.

535
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,429
我不知道為什麼我們不能打給警署 
I don't get why we can't just call the office 

536
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,336
讓他們送輛車來接我們
and have a squad car come pick us up.

537
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,003
不 他們拿走了我們的鞋 我們的槍 還有我們的車
No. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.

538
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,992
我可不能讓署堣H知道
There's no way that's going out on the radio.

539
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,274
如果我們要合作 
Look, if we're gonna do this together, 

540
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,146
有些問題我們必須要解決 好嗎?
there's some issues we need to settle, okay?

541
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,815
我說 你說我下巴不明顯 你說我尿尿像個娘們
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.

542
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,084
你覺得我感受如何?
How do you think that makes me feel?

543
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,254
我說 你的那個清單 你考慮得挺周到 很奇怪
I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.

544
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,593
我聽到了
I hear you.

545
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,532
我們冰釋前嫌 重新開始吧
Let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.

546
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,165
好 重新開始
All right. Fresh start.

547
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,536
也許我們應該叫紡必適兄弟
Maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers,

548
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,403
因為感覺清新舒適
'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.

549
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,740
對嗎?
Right?

550
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,245
讓我們再重新開始一次 
Let's do another fresh start, 

551
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:07,918
因為我想揍你的臉
'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.

552
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,781
好 重新開始
Fine, fresh start.

553
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,686
最後一次
It's the last one.

554
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,391
我要能夠表達清楚再和你交談 你知道嗎
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.

555
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,793
夥計們 大家都聽好了!      聽好了!
Okay, folks! Everybody, listen up!        Listen up!

556
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,399
光天化日之下發生了一起綁架案

大衛·厄森 富有的銀行家 有跨國團隊
David Ershon, wealthy banker, multinational team.

558
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,062
劫持者可能早已埋伏在那 但說不准
Maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.

559
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,576
小矮人 你們的鞋呢 腳都黑乎乎的
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.

560
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,635
誰在乎? 這不是重點
Who cares? It's not important, okay?

561
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,571
霍茲 甘博 頭頭找你們 情況不妙
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

562
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,878
再見 夥計們      再見
Bye, guys.        Bye-bye.

563
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,044

564
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,650
這是唐·比曼 厄森先生的律師
Guys, this is Don Beaman, the attorney for Mr. Ershon.

羅傑·韋斯利 私人保鏢負責人
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

566
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:49,893
嘿 你這賤人!      淡定淡定!
Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch!        Hey, hey, hey!

567
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,724
特 別激動!
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!

568

長官 就是他把我們的槍搶走了

And my shoes!        Wait a minute, wait a minute. 

570

你們表明警察身份了嗎
Did you identify yourselves as police officers?

571

看這是什麼
What is this?

572
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,468
艾倫 告訴我 你們表明了嗎      沒有
Allen, tell me. Did you?        No, we did not.

573
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,086
對不起 先生們 
Sorry, gentlemen. 

574
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,566
我們以為你們當時在綁架厄森先生
We thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.

575
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,270
我們只是按規矩辦事
It's only protocol.

576
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:11,208
厄森先生已經同意補上腳手架事宜 
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation.

577
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,209
這事就結了

厄森先生沒有對你們過度使用武力提起訴訟
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.

581
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,024
謝謝 長官      客氣了
Thank you, Captain.        You bet.

582
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,151
你澳大利亞的?
Australian?

583
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,661
特種兵?
Special Forces, right?

584
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,554
你最好給我小心點 探員

這世界上有三件東西我最喜歡了

凱利·米洛(澳大利亞女歌手)
Kylie Minogue,

587
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,902
女人的股溝
small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...

588
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,372
的確很好看
Beautiful features.

589
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,205
和即將挨揍的男人眼中的恐懼
...and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.

590
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,839
你蛋疼完了沒 正事辦完了就走
Hey! Shake your dicks. This pissing contest is over.

591
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,247
算了
Come on, man.

592
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,914
看 他們把鞋子還回來了
All right, look, they returned your shoes.

593
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:56,589
你們的武器也回來了 給你 特
And they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.

594
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,892
艾倫 有人幫你擦了點亞麻油
Allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it,

595
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,832
上面粘了類似深核桃木的污漬
some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.

596
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,496
你該給他們寫封感謝信
You might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.

597
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,697
好了
Okay.

598
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,898
你在生我們的氣是吧 吉恩
You're mad at us, huh, Gene?

599
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,704
第一 不要叫我吉恩 我是你們的長官
First off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.

600
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,721
你們忘了那個"學聰明點"的演講嗎
Guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?

601
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:16,572
沒忘      那麼
Sure.        All right.

602
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,275
你們是怎麼做的 你們怎麼處理的
Well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?

603
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,182
剛好相反 我們不夠機靈 吉恩長官
The opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.

604
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,221
叫我"長官"就好了
It's just "Captain. "

605
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,349
就叫"長官" 不是"吉恩長官" 又不是少兒節目
Just "Captain. " It's not "Captain Gene. " I don't have a kiddie show.

606
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,052
"吉恩長官" 聽著太不給力了
That sounds creepy, "Captain Gene. "

607
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,521
警方錯誤抓捕了投資銀行家大衛·厄森
Police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.

608
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,533
他是財務分析結果的受害者嗎
Was he the victim of financial profiling?

609
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,553
財務分析? 太扯了吧 
Financial profiling? That's crazy. 

610
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,301
明明是他犯了法我們才逮捕他
He broke the law and we arrested him.

611
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,467
那不是他的保鏢 他說"別讓這些人帶走我"
That wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me. "

612
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,277
當你聽到馬蹄二字 想到的肯定是馬 而不是羊吧
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.

613
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,077
為什麼不是牛或者驢呢?
What about donkeys or deer?

614
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,117
它們都長蹄子 牛科動物神馬的?
They have hooves. What about bovine creatures?

615
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,246
你剛剛是在想 "要有一個新開始"嗎?
Were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?

616
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,291
是的      嗯 我看出來了
Yeah.        Yeah. I could see it.

617
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,850
要不去我家吧
Listen, why don't we just go over to my place?

618
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,221
我們好好談談這個案子
We'll talk the case down.

619
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,227
吃個簡單的晚餐 你可以認識希拉
We can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.

620
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:09,193
我倆只是作為警察在吃飯時候談公務好不好?
Two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?

621
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,330
不是神馬晚餐      好吧
It's not dinner.        Fine.

622
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,232
我先提前道個歉
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

623
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,503
萬一我老婆表現得跟環球第一賤人一樣
in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.

624
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:20,171
她又老又肥 還得瑟得很
She's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.

625
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,744
我把大衛·厄森的個人資料
Okay, so I put together a little bio, 

626
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,682
和照片整理了一下
complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

627
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,584
我用的Adobe視頻軟體 我喜歡週末做點編輯的活
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.

628
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,848
我從"盜亦有道"堸聾F3分鐘的鏡頭
I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.

629
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,188
大衛·厄森目前是厄森財團的CEO
David Ershon is currently the CEO of Ershon Consortium.

630
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,352
是誰在旁白?
Who's that talking?

631
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,987
是一個語音應用 只要99美分
It's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.

632
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:44,091
厄森財團目前的金融投資超過了700億美元
Ershon Consortium, current financial investments exceed $70 billion.

633
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,494

His largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.

634
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,001
蘭道公司拍了一些不明所以的廣告
Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.

635
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,013
是啊 石油 傳媒 社保都有涉及 
Yeah, oil, media, health care, 

636
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:53,169
你該知道他們的影響力
you've probably heard their jingle.

637
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,213
蘭道公司 我們無處不在
Lendl Global, we're in everything

638
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,147
大衛·厄森經常在思嘉利亞的公司出現
David Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...

639
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,549
是啊      還有Maroon 5的領唱
Yeah.        ...and the lead singer of Maroon 5.

640
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,484
這人可能跟販毒集團
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels,

641
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,787
黑市器官販賣和人販子有聯繫
black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.

642
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,418
你的結論和我剛才說的有關係嗎?
How do you get that from anything I just said?

643
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,989
嘿 湯來了
Hey, guys! Soup's on.

644
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,460
什麼意思
What do you mean?

645
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,656
嗨
Hi.

646
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,324
嗨      你肯定是特
Hi.        You must be Terry.

647
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,632
親愛的 我不該躲著你的朋友 晚飯太折騰了
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.

648
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,935
你是誰?      我是希拉·甘博 他老婆啊
Who are you?        I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.

649
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,670
說真的 她是誰      他的黃臉婆
Come on, seriously. Who is that?        His old lady.

650
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,235
小甜心 我們在工作呢      明白
Sweetie, it's a workstation.        Got it.

651
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:33,074
你衣不蔽體的樣子 太讓人分心了
And you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.

652
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,918
我知道你們在工作 對不起
I know you're working. I'm so sorry.

653
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,210
我說真的      真的什麼?
Come on, seriously.        Come on, what?

654
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:38,316
她是誰?
Who is that?

655
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,414
她是老...她是我的負擔
That's the old...That's the old ball and chain.

656
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,318
啵一個
Get over here.

657
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,022
不 這堣ㄕX適      好吧
Not...Not right now.        Okay.

658
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,088
那些都不是考慮的重點
Look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?

659
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,898
你到底說不說她是誰
Come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?

660
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,260
你真的是艾倫的妻子?      我就知道
Are you really Allen's wife?        I know.

661
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,468
他信聖公教 我信天主教 
People are shocked 

662
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,831
別人都不信我們能在一起
because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic,

663
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,942
但事實就是這樣
but somehow it works.

664
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,238
你要換身衣服嗎?      我換了啊
Are you gonna change?        I already did.

665
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,575
沒關係 你看上去漂亮極了
It's no big deal. You look really, really nice.

666
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:10,044
特 沒必要跟她客氣 她穿得太風塵了
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.

667
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:11,485
不許你這樣說她 艾倫
Don't speak to her like that, Allen.

668
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:13,961
如果我把你這身打扮放到潮人應用堶 
Look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, 

669
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,522
你可能不及格
you'd probably get a D-.

670
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,001
艾倫最喜歡開發應用程序了
Allen and his apps. He loves them.

671
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:21,420
他自己設計了3個應用 有一個...我能說嗎?
You know he's designed three of his own? One of them...Can I tell him?

672
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,966
有一個程序 你可以拍任何人的正面
One of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face,

673
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,866
它就會告訴你這個人的後腦勺是什麼樣的
and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.

674
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,436
叫人人後腦勺      人人後腦勺
Faceback.        Faceback.

675
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,864
已經收到很多誇張的評論了
Got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.

676
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,102
肯定會火的      很吸引眼球
It's gonna hit.        It's gonna catch.

677
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,235
你為什麼跟了艾倫?
Why are you with Allen?

678
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,514
不是那個意思 我是說 你倆怎麼認識的?
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?

679
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,750
這是一個典型的邂逅故事 特
It's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.

680
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,513
太乏味了
You're gonna be bored by it.

681
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,762
當時我在尼克斯隊跳舞 
I was a dancer for the Knicks 

682
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:46,581
平時是哥倫比亞醫院的實習生
while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.

683
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,221
艾倫直腸上起了毒疹 送到急救室
Allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.

684
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,085
是的
Yes.

685
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,822
不用說 我對他一見鍾情
Needless to say, I fell for him immediately.

686
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,463
我們在快捷酒店翻雲覆雨了3天
We immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn,

687
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,534
老實說 我們連話都沒說一句      整整3天
and, to be honest, we didn't speak.        Three days

688
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,165
一次話都沒說過
of not communicating once verbally.

689
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,533
不知不覺中
We had actually, without knowing it,

690
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,877
我們學會用眼神調情 用身體語言交流
developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.

691
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,777
特 我們之間有一種原始獸性的衝動
You know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.

692
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,896
經過3天愛意濃濃的
After those three days of non-verbal communication 

693
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,213
身體交流
and a whole lot of loving,

694
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,756
我的屁股都抽筋了 我不得不去看醫生
I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.

695
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,790
就像給屁股發育不良的德國牧羊犬
Similar to operating on a German shepherd

696
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,093
做手術一樣      疼死我了
when they have hip dysplasia.        Very painful.

697
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,963
特別有意思 像那部電影的情節一樣 
It's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie,

698
00:34:33,964 --> 00:34:35,464
我總是忘記名字
 always forget the name of it.

699
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,733
梅格·瑞恩演的      就是
With Meg Ryan.        Yes.

700
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,534
我不記得梅格·瑞恩在什麼電影
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan 

701
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,778
邂逅過屁股長瘡的男人
meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.

702
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,277
我想想 我想想      好
I'll think of it. I'll think of it.        Okay.

703
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,075
特 你呢 有女朋友沒
So, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?

704
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,139
以前有
I did, yeah.

705
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,718
我們本要結婚的 但她後來退縮了 事情比較複雜
We were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.

706
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,161
特奡翹w塈J·傑特開了一槍
Terry shot Derek Jeter.

707
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,755
閉嘴 艾倫 這是哪輩子的事了
Shut up, Allen. This was before.

708
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:52,584
沒關係
That's okay.

709
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,625
電影的名字是 "電子情書"
She's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.

710
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,659
對對對 親愛的
That's it! Honey!

711
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,869
湯姆·漢克斯演的?      是的
With Tom Hanks?        Right.

712
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,987
還有梅格·瑞恩      梅格·瑞恩
And Meg Ryan.        Meg Ryan.

713
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,155
他屁股上可沒長瘡
He didn't have poison ivy up his ass.

714
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,561
他長了的      他真的長了的
Yes, he did.        Yes, he did. Yeah.

715
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,894
就長那兒的
Way up there.

716
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,995
特 很榮幸你能來我家度過這樣一個...
Well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...

717
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,991
一個溫馨美好的夜晚 謝謝
What a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.

718
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:10,599
很高興認識你 特
It was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.

719
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,495
是我的榮幸啊 謝謝
It was my pleasure. Thank you.

720
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:16,003
記住 我只有一個請求 不要讓他受傷 特
And remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.

721
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,480
我每天上班前她都要這麼說      必須的
She tells me that every day before I leave.        Yep, I do.

722
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,649
我下樓給他做鮮草莓汁
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries,

723
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,516
我會說 "小寶貝 不管你今天多忙"
and I say, " Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today,

724
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,919
"都不要受傷"
"you just don't get hurt. "

725
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,521
是啊 每天早上都說
Yeah. Every morning.

726
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,550
接著我給他看我的咪咪 我說 "它們在等你"
And then I show him my breasts, and I say, " These are waiting for you

727
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:32,455
"等你回家"      就是
"when you get back home. "        Right.

728
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,431
特 我的胸部不是他見過最大的
You know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen,

729
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,934
但是它們很神氣      絕不是最大的
but, man, are they perky.        Not by a long shot.

730
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,664
它們很堅挺 它們屬於你      你很漂亮
And they are firm, and they are yours.        You're a nice lady.

731
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,967
謝謝你能來
Thank you for coming.

732
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,000
霍茲和甘博探員? 霍茲和甘博探員? 完畢
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.

733
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,170
霍茲在
Go for Hoitz.

734
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,804
我們找到你的普銳斯車了      太好了
We found your red Prius.        Great.

735
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,975
它正打算為拉爾夫·內德(活動家)投票
It was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.

736
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
得了吧      小寶貝 聽著
Come on.        Okay, sugar balls, listen up.

737
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,650
車上肯定有指紋
There's gonna be fingerprints on that car.

738
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,353
明天我們去提取指紋 放進系統檢索
Tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.

739
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,354
一旦得到匹配結果 
And if we get a hit, 

740
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,821
案子進展肯定勢如破竹
this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.

741
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,226
明天早上你起床後就做一件事 帶上膽子
You do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.

742
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,387
好的      謝謝 希拉
Okay.        Thank you, Sheila.

743
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,555
他會帶上膽子的
He'll bring it.

744
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,292
晚安      晚安
Good night!        Good night.

謝謝你 希拉
Thank you, Sheila.

746
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,061

Bye, Terry!        Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.

747

再見 特      行了 艾倫 回去吧
Bye, Terry!        All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.

748

再見 希拉
Bye, Sheila!

749
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,698

再見 希拉
Bye, Sheila.

751
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,243
不知道他聽見沒 再見 特

752
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,909
再見 希拉
Bye, Sheila!

753
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,759
車在這了 他們把它扔在一座天橋下
Well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.

754
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,522
有什麼發現嗎
You find anything?

755
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,360
很多發現
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

756
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,400
有體液啊毛髮啊什麼的
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

757
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,907
我們相信有一幫無家可歸的老流浪漢
we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes 

758
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,028
在車媔}過狂歡晚會
had an orgy in the car.

759
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:48,868
天哪      節哀吧
Oh, God.        Yeah.

760
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,771
你知道他們把這種狂歡叫什麼嗎
You know what that's called when they do that in there?

761
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,342
流動廚房
That's called a soup kitchen.

762
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,002
髒亂差啊
It's pretty rough stuff.

763
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,570
不多久 一隻母浣熊到車
Not long after that, a mama raccoon came along

764
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,081
生了仔
and gave birth on the floor.

765
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,999
胎盤都噴到後窗上了
Placenta blew out all over the back window there.

766
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,281
後來 有個小鬼到車堛瑣r駛座上
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along

767
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,650
拉了一坨有技術含量的屎
takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.

768
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,722
我猜他知道你們是警察
I think he knew you guys were cops,

769
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,996
因為我把他的便便叫做蓄意報復屎
because this is what I would call a spite shit.

770
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,498
光通過毛髮和體液樣本
You were able to determine all of that

771
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,397
你就能推測處這麼多情節?      當然了
from the hair and fluid samples?        Oh, yeah.

772
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,717
指紋呢 你發現指紋了嗎
What about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?

773
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,332
沒有 什麼指紋都沒有      找到一部手機
Nope, couldn't get a one.        Found a cell phone.

774
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,434
是我的
Yeah, that's mine.

775
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,307
有沒有掙扎或搏鬥的痕跡?
Any signs of a struggle or spent shells?

776
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,928
沒有 來狂歡的都是自願的
No. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.

777
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,973
其實他們還給你留了個便條
In fact, they even left you a note here.

778
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:36,046
"謝謝你的小帳篷 愛你 瀟灑哥和兄弟們"
"Thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys. "

779
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:36,910
這是在車塈鋮鴘
Here's something we found.

780
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,582
我們找到一打沒刮過的彩票
We found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.

781
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,817
沒有指紋神馬的 你看看
No fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.

782
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,413
太遺憾了 
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.

783
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:46,594
我有台普銳斯 現在成破銅爛鐵了
 I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.

784
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,133
這是我第一輛新車 我以前從沒買過新車
It's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.

785
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,964
還發現一頭鹿的陰道
Found a deer vagina.

786
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,338
什麼?      開始還以為是人的嘴唇
What?        Thought it was human lips at first.

787
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,707
我們又仔細看了看 絕對是鹿的陰道
Then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.

788
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,358
連"再來一張"都沒有
Not even a free ticket.

789
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,274
我們該怎麼辦?
What are we gonna do?

790
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,741
指紋沒提取到 還拿了一堆沒用的彩票
We got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.

791
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:09,652
你看 我們被拽下車後有人打了2分鐘的電話
Look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.

792
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,688
用你手機打的?      秘密撥打的
They used your phone?        They ghost dialed.

793
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,916
可能有人在電話那頭監聽
Someone probably sat on it.

794
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,192
厄森被抓時 
It could have recorded some of 

795
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:15,855
他們的部分談話可能被錄下來了
their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.

796
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,691
我們必須調查誰接到了那個電話
We gotta hear the other side of that call.

797
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,727
不 沒必要
Nope, no, it's nothing.

798
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,228
沒必要?      沒必要
Nothing?        It's nothing.

799
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:22,232
這是唯一的線索      真沒必要
It's the only lead we have.        It's nothing.

800
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,532
你這麼激動幹嘛
Why did you just get super jumpy?

801
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,727
怎麼了?
What?

802
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,771
是我前女友
It's an ex-girlfriend, okay?

803
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,601
怎麼了 你倆怎麼回事
What's the matter? What happened with you guys?

804
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,538
沒什麼 哥不想跟她有半毛錢的關係
She was just a bit of a handful, that's it.

805
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,771
艾倫 這是我們唯一的線索
Allen, it's the only lead we have.

806
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:40,914
要麼查下去 要麼撒手不管
We either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.

807
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,385
好吧 去找她
Fine. Let's go see her.

808
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,562
你好啊 克麗斯汀妮斯
Hello, Christinith.

809
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,227
你好 艾倫
Hello, Allen.

810
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,403
這是我同事 特      你好 特萊
That's my partner, Terry.        Hi, Telly.

811
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,605
見鬼了我      別緊張 放鬆
Holy shit. Dude.        Just relax, relax.

812
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:13,382
我在高塔音像店等了你4個小時
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.

813
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,086
那是13年前的事了
That was 13 years ago.

814
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,518
阿諾·旁姆來啦 阿諾·旁姆來啦 
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.

815
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,533
誰要喝倫家調製的飲料?
 Who wants some Arnie Palmies?

816
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,021
親愛的 這杯有伏特加加哦 這杯
Sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.

817
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,294
放桌上就好了       好滴
Hal, just place it down, please.        All righty.

818
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,363
放好了啦
Okay.

819
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:41,638
我跟你合體的姿勢 都沒有跟別人嘗試過
I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.

820
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,009
真的沒有
No.

821
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,489
克麗斯汀妮斯 你老公在 別說了
Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.

822
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,656
沒事 他全知道
Oh, no, he knows all of this.

823
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,474
你太幸運了      就是
You're a lucky dog.        It's true.

824
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,387
克麗斯汀 你家很漂亮
Christine, this is a lovely house.

825
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,817
我叫克麗斯汀妮斯 你是傻子還是聾子?
It's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?

826
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:59,721
克麗斯汀妮斯 蠢豬!
Christinith, you idiot!

827
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:04,352
到我們家 就得把我老婆的名字叫對了!
You come to our house, you get my wife's name right!

828
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,833
什麼?      克麗斯汀妮斯!
What?        Christinith!

829
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,667
你們如此好客 我們表示很感動
Look, we really appreciate the hospitality.

830
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,167
我們想聽聽你的電話錄音
We'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.

831
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,500
它很有可能關係到一起綁架案
We believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.

832
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:21,000
好啊 我們去廚房吧 我把它放給你聽
Okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it

833
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,511
別人都不許來
and everyone else stay here.

834
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,350
沒問題 親愛的      來吧
Okay, sweetie.        Come on.

835
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,594
電話在那      太好了 謝謝...
There's my phone.        Great, thank you for...

836
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,737
我恨你 你這賤人!
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

837
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,905
你力氣真大      我比你想像的力氣更大!
You're so strong.        I'm stronger than you will ever know!

838
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,000
我恨你 我恨你
I hate you! I hate you!

839
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,603
你太可愛了 看你這張臉蛋 看你這張臉蛋
You're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.

840
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,717
說 "我耐你" 快說 "我耐你 克斯妮斯"
You go, "I wuv you. " Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith. "

841
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:04,861
你可能覺得因為我長了絡腮鬍 所以汗毛很重
You probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.

842
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,930
其實我沒有啦
But I'm not.

843
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,799
我刮過的
Shaved.

844
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,030
艾倫!      他沒事的
Allen!        He's fine.

845
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,197
問你一個問題
Question.

846
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,399
你想當哪種動物
What would you rather be,

847
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,243
熊還是狗?
a bear or a dog?

848
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,346
無所謂      我想當
I don't care.        I wanna be

849
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,275
熊狗 一半狗 一半熊那種
a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

850
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,318
因為熊狗既可以當寵物住在家
'Cause that way, I could live in the house

851
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,957
又能夠去小樹林里拉屎
but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.

852
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,586
艾倫!
Allen!

853
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,354
艾倫! 艾倫!
Allen! Allen!

854
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,663
這是警方證據 特 跑啊!      嘿!
This is police evidence. Terry! Let's go!        Hey!

855
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,260
你得回來跟我老婆合體!
You get back here and you make love to my wife!

856
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,895
艾倫! 艾倫!
Allen! Allen!

857
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,267
我想不通 我實在想不通
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.

858
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,607
克麗斯汀妮斯身材超辣的
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.

859
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,340
你老婆也讓人噴鼻血
Your wife is crazy hot.

860
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,347
即使旁邊有個巴西人妖 
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, 

861
00:41:59,348 --> 00:42:00,611
她還是暗示你"上我吧"
she threw you a "Do me" vibe.

862
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
你怎麼那麼吸引辣妹?
What is it with you and hot ladies?

863
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,936
首先 我老婆是可愛 不是火辣
First off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.

864
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:09,750
你腦子裝漿糊了嗎 你老婆那麼性感
Dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.

865
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,626
你到底聽不聽電話錄音?      聽吧
You wanna listen to this message or not?        Yeah, whatever.

866
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:13,896
你要去辦一件事
You have one job, mate.

867
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,289
找個可憐蟲和你共同投資
Find a sucker to invest with you

868
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,101
這樣你就能把錢還給我老闆了
so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.

869
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,330
我不在乎你找誰
And I don't care who.

870
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,735
對了 我想起來我這有個可憐蟲
Right. I actually think I found a sucker...

871
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,273
他讓厄森...投資320億美元
He's talking to Ershon. ...to invest $32 billion.

872
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,263
誰傻逼兮兮地拿320億讓人搶啊
Who's got $32 billion to rob?

873
00:42:26,264 --> 00:42:28,273
只要我拿到錢 我會纂改數據
Once I get the money, I'll falsify the records

874
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,176
告訴他們損失慘重 再給你的員工付工資
to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.

875
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,911
既然你跟著我 我現在就去公園大道2300號
Now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,

876
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,577
接著...
and after that...

877
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,450
我就說他們不是保安
I told you it wasn't a security team.

878
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,279
他被綁架了      明顯的事 但為什麼...暈...
He was being abducted.        Obviously, but what kind...Holy...

879
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,550
進了我家門 必須跟我老婆合體!
Nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!

880
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,787
是他嗎?      是啊
Is that him?        Yeah!

881
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,692
他們從哪兒冒出來的?
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!

882
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,595
見鬼!      他們追了我們20英里
Holy shit!        They chased us 20 miles.

883
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,094
回來 給我回來!      艾倫!
You come back here! You get back here!        Allen!

884
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,237
公園大道2300號 是彩票公司
2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.

885
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,675
該死 就是我們找到的那些彩票
Holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.

886
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:08,183
厄森通過發售彩票來彌補他的損失
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.

887
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:11,205
320億 一個州的收入啊
$32 billion. That's the state's money.

888
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,083
我們怎麼跟毛奇交代? 有人虧錢了
Well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.

889
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,517
我們只有一條粗略的語音信息和一個地址 
We have a scratchy cell phone message and an address. 

890
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,700
半個案子都不算
It's still half a case.

891
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,687
肯定有書面記錄 
There's gotta be some sort of paper trail. 

892
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:20,424
要是能找到 我們可以跟蹤
If we can find that, if we can track it,

893
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,513
然後告訴毛奇這事
then we can go to Mauch.

894
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,759
我調查了厄森的會計公司
So, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm,

895
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,566
發現一些有意思的事
and I found some pretty interesting stuff.

896
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,802
G-D會計公司...
It turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...

897
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,938
等等 到我了
Hold on, I'm up.

898
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,306
我把愛獻給了厄琳
I gave my love to Erin

899
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,947
她答應等我
She promised to be true

900
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:48,481
當我從戰場上回來
I went to war to come back

901
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,528
已經有5個英國士兵
And find five British soldiers

902
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,827
和她有過戀情
Had their way with her

903
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,369
他們互相吸引
It was consensual

904
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,163
唱完了?
Done?

905
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,307
G-D會計公司在新澤西州的費爾良
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

906
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,369
只有一個客戶 大衛·厄森
has only one client, David Ershon.

907
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,004
這種手法對他來說太老套了
Pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.

908
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,811
貌似我們該去新澤西拜訪一下會計公司
Looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.

909
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,648
累死人的一天
That's a shitty day.

910
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,949
他們的父親都被吊死
And all their fathers were hanged

911
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,484
所有的孩子哭紅了雙眼
And the children all got pink eye

912
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:35,802
哈利波特全集丟進火坑
While their Harry Potter books were burned

913
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,758
唱這些歌很有意思嗎? 太壓抑了
Do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.

914
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:44,980
有意思啊 它們包含了深刻的歷史
I do. They're full of rich history.

915
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,674
靠 我遲到了 該去見我女朋友的
Damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.

916
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:50,652
你們不是分手了嗎
I thought you said you guys split up.

917
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,246
我倆之間只談工作行嗎
Let's just keep our thing about work, okay?

918
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,915
好的 再見 兄弟
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

919
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,016
別碰我
Hey, get off me, man.

920
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,342
你在幹嘛呢
What the hell are you doing?

921
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,389
跳舞啊 特 你在這幹嘛
I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?

922
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,246
我愛你 弗朗辛
I love you, Francine.

923
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,208
要是你沒和我分手 
If you were with me, 

924
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:26,785
你也不用為了錢在這跳脫衣舞啊
you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!

925
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,718
這是芭蕾排練室 特 這堛瑪管是水平的
This is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.

926
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,854
他很愛你 弗朗辛
He loves you very much, Francine.

927
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,749
他是誰      你在這幹嘛 艾倫?
Who is this guy?        What are you doing here, Allen?

928
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,094
我們是同事嘛
It's the code. I'm your partner.

929
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,362
我來挺我的朋友兼工作夥伴的
I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.

930
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,928
弗朗辛 這個人在騷擾你嗎
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

931
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,997
他是誰 你的新男友嗎? 太好了 你有新男友了
Who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.

932
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:49,412
他是我的舞伴 特
He is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?

933
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,277
我知道這對你來說是個驚喜
I know that this is a big surprise,

934
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,444
但是除了當警察 世界上還有很多別的事可做
but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?

935
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,752
如果你沒別的事的話 我要跳舞了
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.

936
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,918
怎麼 你覺得我不會這玩意麼
What, you don't think I can do this shit?

937
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,665
太出乎意料了 特
That was surprisingly good, Terry.

938
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,738
我愛你 弗朗辛      你不懂什麼叫愛
I love you, Francine.        You don't know what love is.

939
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,509
他很愛你 弗朗辛!
He loves you very much, Francine!

940
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,530
他說話我聽得見 謝謝你
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.

941
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,677
你看你怎麼對我的嗎? 你森森地割裂了我的心
You know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.

942
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,277
別瞪我 死人!
And don't eyeball me, man!

943
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,354
你就跟這麼磕磣的癮君子眉來眼去嗎?
You're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?

944
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,113
特!
Terry!

945
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,084
他對你的行為很失望!
He does not approve of your behavior!

946
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:35,959
你可以走了
Can you please go?

947
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,774
你也是 站門口那神經病!
And you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?

948
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,660
走吧 艾倫
Let's go, Allen.

949
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,694
我們今天都跳了一場自己的芭蕾
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.

950
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,834
飽含情緒的芭蕾
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

951
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,864
你是來煽風點火的
You're kind of making things worse.

952
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,317
沒事吧?      沒事
You okay?        Yeah, I'm fine.

953
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,246
我不知道你居然會跳舞
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.

954
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,660
我小時候學的舞步 去取笑別人
We used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids,

955
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,092
給他們看這些舞步是多可笑
show them how queer they were, okay?

956
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,023
你學跳舞是為了諷刺別人啊?      我想是的
You learned to dance like that sarcastically?        Yeah, I guess.

957
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,661
別摻和我的私人生活行嗎? 小孩的心思你不懂
Stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.

958
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,900
專注這個案子吧 明天新澤西見
Stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.

959
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,899
好吧 特
All right, Terry.

960
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,038
我覺得很釋然 不知道你怎麼想
Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.

961
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,936
看這個 6個月以前的文章
Here, check this out. Article from six months ago.

962
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,597
講了彩票業
Talking about how the lottery is looking

963
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,438
投資300億美元的行為過於激進
to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.

964
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,097
所以他在販毒?
So he's dealing drugs?

965
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,112
跟販毒沒關係 我們不是在拍"邁阿密風雲"
No, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.

966
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,050
對不起 我...
Look, I'm sorry. I just...

967
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:16,454
我今天情緒不好 希拉和我昨晚鬧矛盾了
I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.

968
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,359
怎麼了
What happened?

969
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,062
她想去進修機構學一門課
She was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?

970
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,634
叫"口交的藝術"
Called "The Art of Oral Sex"?

971
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,599
我們目前沒有足夠的預算
You know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.

972
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,174
她總是只考慮自己
It's always about her.

973
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,543
是啊...是不應該
Yeah, that's...That's messed up.

974
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,769
我給你準備了一份禮物
Hey, I got you a gift.

975
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,577
我看見它就想到你了 
I just saw something, and I thought of you, 

976
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,590
我不想搞得很奇怪
and so, I don't want it to be weird.

977
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:42,585
只是表示友好哈
I just wanted to be nice.

978
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,683
當然很奇怪了
Of course it's weird.

979
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,585
一個成年男人給另一個男人送禮物
It's a grown man giving another man a present.

980
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,589
給你 打開看看
There you go. Open it up.

981
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,093
沒事的 不用謝
It's okay, you're welcome.

982
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,297
我喜歡送人禮物
I like to do things like that.

983
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:55,560
看它說的什麼
Take a look what it says.

984
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,700
FBI
FBI.

985
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,700
女性身體檢查官
Female Body Inspector.

986
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,110
我們都屬於執法系統
You know, because we're both in law enforcement.

987
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,769
都喜歡女人
We both like women.

988
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,872
但我的幽默感很奇怪 病態的幽默
But I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.

989
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,377
我不能看它 看一眼就要笑死過去
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.

990
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,749
我也是
Me, too.

991
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,320
做得好 很有禮貌
Real nice. You know, it's all class.

992
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,961
好      別再來這套了
Okay.        Don't do that shit any more.

993
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,429
相信我 不會了
Yeah, believe me, I won't.

994
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,364
你明白它為什麼搞笑嗎
Do you understand what's so funny about it, though?

995
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,831
因為它寫著FBI 字母一樣 標誌也一樣
'Cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.

996
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:39,439
第一眼看上去 它只是一個寫了"FBI"的馬克杯
And at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI."

997
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,674
但你再看一眼 "女性身體檢查官"?
But then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?

998
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,109
太扯了 這都想得出來...
Get out of town. This is outrageous...

999
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,279
閉嘴!
Shut up!

1000
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,027
總有一天 我會越過你的怒火
I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours

1001
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,192
直達你的內心
one of these days,

1002
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,428
那將是我的光榮
and it's gonna be glorious.

1003
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,005
我們是不是該告訴毛奇 我們在查這個地方?
Shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?

1004
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:14,291
為什麼? 我們只是調查一下
For what? We're just going to check it out.

1005
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:15,876
我知道 但這是程序嘛
I know, but it's procedure.

1006
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,074
特堛磳雰I默
Terry answers to no one.

1007
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,911
我該幹嘛幹嘛
I do what I do.

1008
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,821
哪家會計公司會在週二上午11點關門啊?
What accounting firm is closed at 11:00 a. m. On a Tuesday?

1009
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:26,801
這就是個空殼
This is a shithole.

1010
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,489
我喜歡爆破
I love bombs.

1011
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,762
我聽不見了! 我聽不見了!
I can't hear! I can't hear!

1012
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,228
我手上起水泡了!
There's blood blisters on my hands!

1013
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,397
額滴神吶!
Oh, my God!

1014
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,771
為什麼電影堛漱H沒有被炸飛
How do they walk away in movies without flinching

1015
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,571
還能安然無恙地路過呢?
when it explodes behind them?

1016
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:51,119
不可能! 電影神馬的都是浮雲!
There's no way! I call bullshit on that!

1017
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,581
當他們乘坐千年鷹號飛離死亡之星時
When they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star,

1018
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,924
死亡之星就發生了大爆炸 全是鬼扯!
and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!

1019
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:02,020
不許你說星球大戰的壞話! 演的都是真的!
Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!

1020
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,093
我要做個核磁共振
I need an MRI.

1021
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,461
我要做核磁共振! 我軟組織受傷了
I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.

1022
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,617
我的軟組織絕對受傷了
There's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.

1023
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:12,300
消停一下吧
Please stop.

1024
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:15,031
我想蜷縮在女人的懷堻雈!
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!

1025
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,874
消防部認為是天然氣洩漏 
Fire Department said it was a gas leak, 

1026
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,029
但不可能 這是定時炸彈
but no way. That was timed.

1027
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,523
他們不想殺我們 他們要我們害怕
They didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.

1028
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:26,939
是啊 他們成功了
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?

1029
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,645
我累了 行了吧?
I'm tired of this. All right?

1030
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,279
我不想再經歷爆炸或被人用槍指著頭了
I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.

1031
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,482
我想坐回辦公桌跟前
I wanna go back to my desk.

1032
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,050
你知道嗎? 生活有時就是這樣震耳欲聾
Guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.

1033
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,729
你不能一輩子都躲在辦公桌後面
You can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.

1034
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,461
為什麼不可以? 我已經躲了很多年了
You know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?

1035
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,468
辦公室奡N沒有爆炸
There's no explosions at my desk.

1036
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:51,473
家埵頂谷v嬌妻 但沒有爆炸
There's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.

1037
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,539
你在害怕什麼?
What are you afraid of, man?

1038
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,174
我是你的搭檔 你可以告訴我 你在害怕什麼?
I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?

1039
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,284
我那時大二
I was a sophomore in college.

1040
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,750
我讀的大學決定增加學費
The university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.

1041
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,518
我一個同學 布蘭達 
A classmate of mine, Brenda, 

1042
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,731
為了籌錢交學費
in an effort to raise money and stay in school,

1043
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,768
想到了一個好點子
came up with a nifty plan

1044
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,603
就是跟男生約會 問他們要錢
where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.

1045
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,063
我隨時都有約會
I go on dates all the time,

1046
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,267
跟不同的男人
with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.

1047
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,508
我需要人幫忙
And I kind of need somebody to help me out, 

1048
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:29,211
就是找個搭檔幫我牽線救場
like, you know, my partner in crime.

1049
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,543
嗯 我可以安排
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

1050
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,207
對對 我也是這麼想的
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1051
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,808
提供接送服務什麼的      對對
Provide transportation services.        Yeah, yeah.

1052
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,246
聊天很愉快      感謝你來找我
It's gonna be a good time.        Thanks so much for asking me.

1053
00:52:38,247 --> 00:52:40,589
她說她要我幫忙 確保約會順利
She said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay

1054
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,115
男人付給她錢 她答應給我分紅
and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.

1055
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,492
天啊 你是個皮條客      什麼? 暈 不是
Oh, my God. You were a pimp.        What? God, no.

1056
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,656
我只是想幫朋友
No, I was just trying to help a friend.

1057
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,326
我們開始掙了很多錢
We started making a lot of money.

1058
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,237
沒想到的是 布蘭達的朋友們
And wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends

1059
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,002
也想加入這個活動
decided they wanted to be a part of it.

1060
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,771
沒過多久 我保護的女孩子有14個之多
Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting

1061
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,472
她們都給我分紅
while they gave me money.

1062
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,394
你養了一窩妓女
That's called a stable of whores.

1063
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,011
我們決定給我換個名字 
We decided I shouldn't use my real name.

1064
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,954
於是我起了"蓋特"這名
 So we came up with the name "Gator. "

1065
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,655
你絕對是皮條客
I'm telling you, you were a pimp.

1066
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,350
不是! 你有沒有聽我說話?
No! Are you even listening to the story?

1067
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,304
總之 有一天我醒來 看著鏡子堛漲菑v
Anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror,

1068
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,594
發現我討厭自己這副面孔
and I don't like what I see.

1069
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,860
我已經無法掌控局面 而我都沒有意識到
I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.

1070
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,503
在皮條客那行沒有良心可言
You can't have a conscience in the pimp game.

1071
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,003
一天晚上 我最喜歡的兩個女孩
One night, two of my favorite girls,

1072
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,304
凱蒂和卓琳說 "加入我們吧"
Candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in,"

1073
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,676
接著她們把我丟在了急救室
and they dropped me off at the emergency room.

1074
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,961
我就在那遇見了希拉 那時我很狼狽
That's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.

1075
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:42,227
我給自己和她許諾 
I made a promise to myself and to her 

1076
00:53:42,228 --> 00:53:44,273
再也不能讓人生失控
that I would never get out of control again.

1077
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,187
所以 我一畢業
So, as soon as I graduated from college,

1078
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,191
就做了警察局的會計
I became an accountant for the police department.

1079
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,523
我能想到的最穩定的工作
The most stable job I could think of.

1080
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,531
管社會治安的會計
An accountant for law and order.

1081
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,897
我再也不想體驗被生活操縱的日子了
I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.

1082
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,703
別擔心 哥支持你
Don't worry. I got your back.

1083
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,510
我們去找厄森 看他什麼反應吧
Now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.

1084
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:13,078
我不想再躡手躡腳地查案了      好
I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around.        Okay.

1085
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,446
要麼從木板上走過去 要麼脫褲子
You can either walk the plank or take your panties off.

1086
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:17,846
你選一個
The choice is yours.

1087
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,898
我選脫褲子
I want to take my panties off.

1088
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,787
真聰明
You've made a wise choice, you have.

1089
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:24,161
厄森先生 甘博探員
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble 

1090
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:26,690
和槍擊德塈J·傑特的那人來了
and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.

1091
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,859
請進 先生們
Gentlemen, please.

1092
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,231
記得我們嗎 帥哥?      當然記得 請坐
Remember us, hotshot?        Of course I do. Please, sit.

1093
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,996
看她爆炸了
There she blows.

1094
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,671
兩杯伏特加 不要青檸 只要酸黃瓜
Two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.

1095
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,871
猜我們從哪兒來? 你的會計公司爆炸了
Guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.

1096
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,443
是啊 該死的天然氣洩漏
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1097
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,531
天然氣洩漏? 
Gas leak? 

1098
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:49,621
你口臭洩漏還差不多
The only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.

1099
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:54,580
我只能感謝上天沒人受重傷
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.

1100
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,587
我憎恨死亡
I absolutely abhor death.

1101
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,085
得了吧 耶穌 別裝了
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?

1102
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,388
我們知道抓你的人並非你的保安
We know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.

1103
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:05,865
也知道你想引大魚上鉤來彌補損失
And we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.

1104
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:08,220
你再胡說 我就打得你鼻青臉腫
You talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.

1105
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:10,335
這杯水太好喝了 
God, this water is good.

1106
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,913
特 你喝了嗎?      閉嘴 艾倫
Terry, have you tried the water?        Shut up Allen

1107
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:16,290
我向你保證 我完全不知道你們在說什麼
I assure you I have no idea what you're talking about

1108
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:18,942
我知道腳手架這攤子事
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up 

1109
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:20,298
有一點混亂
with the whole scaffolding business.

1110
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:25,803
這塊黃瓜讓這瓶水更加...
The cucumber accents the water in such a way that...

1111
00:55:26,972 --> 00:55:28,690
為了表示我的歉意 
Perhaps by way of apology, 

1112
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:31,706
我可以送你們尼克斯隊比賽的前排座位
I can offer you my personal courtside seats

1113
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:35,941

加油 尼克斯隊 加油 
Come on, Knicks! Come on! 

1115
00:55:40,749 --> 00:55:43,449
我對尼克斯的狂熱 是很有感染力的
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!

1116
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,817
嘿 我覺得坐到這堳靬_怪 感覺像是賄賂
Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.

1117
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:53,455
是賄賂 狗仔子 我看到前場票 就沒多想了
It is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.

1118
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:54,827
走吧
come on

1119

1120
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,267
抱歉      你耍得什麼把戲
Excuse me.        That was a trick.

1121
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:01,738
別再玩了
No more

1122
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:07,177
先生們 你們要選 媽媽咪呀還是澤西男孩
Gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.

1123
00:56:10,516 --> 00:56:13,576
太棒了 難以置信
Fantastic! You're so unbelievable!

1124
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,990
該死 他又耍了這招
Damn it. He did it again.

1125
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:23,257
不好意思      不要再給票了
Excuse me.        No more tickets.

1126
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:25,262
厄森先生 我試過讓他們在休息室等
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.

1127
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,595
沒事 蘇珊 兩杯冰川礦泉水 加地中海青檸
That's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.

1128
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,532
不 不 不用 不用水 我們不是來喝水的
No, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.

1129
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,661
不 我倒是很想要杯水的
No, I was very much looking forward to having a water.

1130
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:37,208
澤西男孩很棒吧?      不是棒 太美妙絕倫了
How great is Jersey Boys?        It's not great. It's fantastic!

1131
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:40,642
你絕對賤賣了 那壯麗的場景 服裝
You totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.

1132
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:42,340
哇哦 正翻了的音樂劇
Wow, what a musical.

1133
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:44,313
嘿 過來
Hey. Get over here.

1134
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:46,611
你怎麼回事?      什麼?
What's wrong with you?        What?

1135
00:56:46,685 --> 00:56:48,175
我們來這堣ㄛO聊這個的
That's not what we're here for.

1136
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:51,180
我們來唱白臉 黑臉 好嗎?
We're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?

1137
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,516
既然是書中記載中最古老的方法 肯定會有用
It's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.

I come strong, then you come in.        Right. Got it.

你給我聽著 你個雜種
Now you listen to me, you piece of shit.

1142
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:04,694

It's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!

1143
00:57:04,803 --> 00:57:06,701
你是怎麼掩蓋你的損失的? 
How did you cover your losses up? 

1144
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,002
你為哪個毒品巨頭賣命?
What drug cartel are you working with now?

1145
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:13,010

聽著 我真的很抱歉
Look, I'm really sorry about that.

1152
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:38,860
我看到你那麼有攻擊性 我想
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought,

1153
00:57:38,937 --> 00:57:41,479
"哇 我要做得更狠才行 
"Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that, 

1154
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,667
"因為我們在唱黑臉 黑臉"
"since we're doing bad cop, bad cop. "

1155
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,104
什麼? 不是 我是說
What? No, I said, 

1156
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:47,738
"白臉 黑臉" 我是黑臉 你是白臉
"Good cop, bad cop. " I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.

1157
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:49,374
好吧 事情都這樣了 
Okay, then there it is. 

1158
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:52,450
算了 我以為你說黑臉 黑臉
That's it. I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop. "

1159
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:56,020
好吧 當你發瘋那會 看看我從他桌上拿到什麼
Well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.

1160
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:58,181
我想這是他的電話清單      不錯
Think it's his phone sheet.        Nice.

1161
00:57:58,524 --> 00:58:00,219
七個打給彩票辦公室的電話
Seven calls to the lottery office.

1162
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,083
這可能是我們破毛奇案的證據
That could be the evidence we need for Mauch.

1163
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:07,730
退後 哥倫比亞毒梟      你從哪把他們招來的?
Get back. Colombian drug lords.        Where are you getting that from?

1164
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,729
老天
Jeesus

1165
00:58:19,545 --> 00:58:21,979
如果你沒有打傷傑特 你的事業還不飛黃騰達?
Can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?

1166
00:58:29,788 --> 00:58:31,224
我們惹來的 對吧?
We call this in, right?

1167

看來我們已經拿到所有證據了
Looks like we got all the evidence we need.

1168

我們把他們裝上車 把他們送回去
We'll load them up, send them back to go.

1170
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,639
我靠      什麼?
Holy shit.        What?

1171
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:54,439
你什麼意思? 什麼? 我們在哪?
What do you mean, what? Where are we?

1172
00:58:55,814 --> 00:58:57,247
我們在沙漠
We're in the high desert.

1173
00:58:57,316 --> 00:59:01,082
他們又拿走我的鞋子 他媽的拿我鞋幹嗎?
They took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?

1174
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:02,677
他們拿走了你的木槍?      是的
They took your wooden gun?        Yeah.

1175
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:11,491

Hello?        Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.

1176

1177
00:59:13,098 --> 00:59:14,929
是 是 你在哪? 發生什麼事了?
Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?

1178
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,798
長官 這說來話長了 但是我長話短說
Captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

1179
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:19,337
我們在拉斯維加斯 好嗎?
We are in Las Vegas, all right?

1180

put on a freight train, and shipped out here.

1182
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:25,309

Let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.

1183

Look, we think something's going on, okay?

1185
00:59:29,281 --> 00:59:32,348
我們認為厄森想通過彩票來掩蓋他的損失
We think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.

1186
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:37,755
慢著 我明白地告訴過你幾次 "別查厄森"?
Wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?

1187
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:39,453
特 長官想知道

I don't know what you two have been up to,

1214
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:53,795

In 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.

一個從來沒有來過這的人
Guy never comes down here.

Twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.

He's a heavyweight cat, that guy.        He was sitting right here.

這把木槍我扣下了
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.

To give me back my real gun?        No.

It's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble

1232
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:49,579
有真槍的人會過來幫你
and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.

1233

金融部分是他們裁決的範圍
The financial district's under their jurisdiction.

1238

你還不明白嗎? 這個案子是我們管的
Don't you get it? This case is talking to us!

1239

我是只孔雀 長官 你這次得讓我飛一下吧
I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!

1240
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,241
你知道嗎 特? 我們別爭了 孔雀不飛
You know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.

1241
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:14,767
他們就飛那麼一點      是 像企鵝那樣
They fly, they fly a little bit.        Yeah, about as much as a penguin.

1242
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:18,475
還有個事 幫我個忙 別逞能
One more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.

1243
01:02:19,184 --> 01:02:21,944
是意外嗎 還是你只有意引述TLC的歌?
Was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?

1244
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:23,645
我都不知道你在說什麼
I don't even understand the reference.

1245
01:02:24,189 --> 01:02:26,416
你不知道你說了什麼?      我不知道那是什麼
You don't understand what you said?        I don't know what that is.

1246
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:27,858

How did they get that story?

1248

我真是煩透了被當做弄巧成拙的笨蛋了
I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.

1249
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:46,502

Well, I serve as treasurer to the union.

1255
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,392
我煮了一壺無咖啡因咖啡
I make a wicked pot of decaf.

1256
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:07,026
正是 你一無是處
Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!

1257
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:12,194
也許沒錯 特 這就是為啥我總是很難過的原因
Probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.

1258
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:14,902
我出去走走
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1259
01:03:15,006 --> 01:03:16,268
鮑勃      說點什麼
Bob!        Say something.

1260
01:03:16,374 --> 01:03:18,239
回來 鮑勃
Come on! Bob!

1261
01:03:18,343 --> 01:03:21,294
我不是那個意思 好嗎? 我很生氣
I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.

1262
01:03:39,064 --> 01:03:44,161
其實 我們不放在這 這是一個安裝的藝術品
Actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.

1263
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:46,879
這個咖啡桌?      是的 我們不在這上面放飲料
This coffee table?        Yes. We don't put drinks on it.

1264
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:53,370
50萬?      他看得懂 恭喜
Five hundred thousand?        He can read! Congratulations.

1265
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:55,706
什麼?      抱歉 你來對地方了嗎?
What?        I'm sorry, are you in the right place?

1266
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,078
還是走錯了? 我...
Or not? I'm...

1267
01:03:59,284 --> 01:04:00,478
特      他...好吧
Terry.        Does he... Okay.

1268
01:04:00,552 --> 01:04:03,817
好吧      對不起 特 你來這幹嗎?
Well...        Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?

1269
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:09,425
我想和你在一起      不 特 這不可能
I want to be with you.        No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.

1270
01:04:09,794 --> 01:04:12,722
你知道你屬於哪 波克山 躺我的身上
You know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.

1271
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:15,290
而現在 你卻在這賣這個髒不拉嘰的咖啡桌?
Instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?

1272
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:17,025
我是說 看看 這東西不知所謂
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!

1273
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:19,976
特 這堳╞接廕蜈w-詹姆森的原作
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.

1274
01:04:19,977 --> 01:04:24,253
混亂的咖啡桌? 表示我們破碎的自尊
The chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.

1275
01:04:24,576 --> 01:04:26,567
你認為我不認識這個假裝藝術家的拉圾?
You think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?

1276
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:28,837
這個咖啡桌不是什麼勞什子的自尊 
This coffee table isn't the ego. 

1277
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:31,406
它表示在資本主義主導的與世隔絕的面前
It represents our shattered sense of community

1278
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,713
我們大眾亂七八糟的品味
in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.

1279
01:04:33,818 --> 01:04:35,725
看起來像是辛迪·謝爾曼
Looks like the work of Cindy Sherman 

1280
01:04:35,726 --> 01:04:36,597
或是弗蘭克·斯特拉的作品
or Frank Stella.

1281
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:38,702
你怎麼知道這個 特?
How did you know that, Terry?

1282
01:04:38,823 --> 01:04:40,291
我在羅德島設計學院上了幾堂課
I took some classes at RISD

1283
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:42,674
這樣我可以取笑我鄰居那些差勁的假藝術家
so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.

1284
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:45,094
特 聲音小點      我幹嗎要說小點
Terry, lower your voice!        I don't have to lower my voice.

1285
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:46,618
這個男人在騷擾你?
Is this man bothering you?

1286
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:48,292
你和這個討厭鬼上床了
Are you actually having sex with this creep?

1287
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,131
特 他是同志 好不?
Terry, he's gay. Okay?

1288
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:54,065
他甚至穿了件 "我是同志"的T恤
He's even wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm gay"!

1289
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:56,454
好嗎? 還有 他是我老闆
All right? And also, he is my boss.

1290
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,701
為你高興 小子 好吧
Happy for you, man. Good.

1291
01:04:57,776 --> 01:04:59,641
你現在可以走開嗎? 我在和我的女人說話
Can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.

1292
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:03,177
瑞格先生 沒事的 特堨翮n走了
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.

1293
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,674
嘟嘟得不錯 水手      老天
Nice toot, sailor.        Jesus.

1294
01:05:06,918 --> 01:05:08,852
特 你在幹嗎?
Terry, what are you doing?

1295
01:05:09,354 --> 01:05:12,755
聽著 為了讓你事業有所發展 我等了你三年
Look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?

1296
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:14,319
再多給我一年
Just give me one more year.

1297
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:17,309
特 沒有再一年了 我們完了
Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.

1298
01:05:17,662 --> 01:05:18,720
好吧
Fine.

1299
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:22,394
特 別碰那個 特      哦 我的天啦
Terry, don't touch that! Terry!        Oh, my God!

1300
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:24,668
我不需要這破玩意 我不需要你
I don't need this shit. I don't need you!

1301
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:28,003
還有你再打給我 我也不會回來
And when you call me, I'm not coming back!

1302
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,400
哦 小子 好正的1號哦      好男人喲
Oh, boy! Over the top!        How outr?

1303
01:05:32,477 --> 01:05:35,044
我要把這破玩意燒成粉碎
I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!

1304
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,712
有生氣 有活力      我喜歡他的直接
Fresh! Energetic!        I love his rawness!

1305
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:42,144
別評價我了 好嗎? 我是個人 我不是件藝術品
Stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!

1306
01:05:42,454 --> 01:05:44,285
是的 你是的      好哇
Yes, you are.        Bravo!

1307
01:05:44,623 --> 01:05:47,319
我是飛越彩虹的孔雀
I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!

1308
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:50,486
是的 是的
Yes! Yes!

1309
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:02,298
這個燉牛小排嘗起來像狗屁股
These braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.

1310
01:06:02,407 --> 01:06:04,202
寶貝      你知道嗎 我坐在這媟Q
Sweetie.        You know what, I'm sitting here thinking,

1311
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:07,372
這個世界有誰會慢慢燉狗屁股
"Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole

1312
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:09,413
給他們的老公吃?
"and serve it to their husband?"

1313
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:12,917
你會的      你太可怕了 怎麼了?
You would.        You are being awful. What's wrong?

1314
01:06:12,984 --> 01:06:17,717
長官不讓我們查那個案子      我很遺憾
Captain took us off the case.        I'm sorry.

1315
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:21,512
我告訴特塈琣b大學的黑暗日子
I told Terry about my dark days in college, 

1316
01:06:21,513 --> 01:06:23,724
 讓我感觸良多
and it brought up some feelings.

1317
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:26,917
好吧 親愛的 那是很久以前了
Well, honeydick, that was a long time ago. 

1318
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:29,396
你已經不是之前那個你了
You're not that same person you were.

1319
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,736
不 你還不明白 我內心有個惡魔
No, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.

1320
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:35,729
它想出來 出來走走
It wants to get out. It wants to walk around.

1321
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:38,935
它想四處遊蕩弄點錢 想買些鞋子
It wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.

1322
01:06:39,044 --> 01:06:41,624
它想要和人們邊走邊說 
And it wants to walk up with the people and say,

1323
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,989
"嘿 蓋特不是說著玩的"
 "Hey, Gator don't play no shit. "

1324
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:45,280
你明白嗎?      是的
You feel me?        Yeah.

1325
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:49,444
蓋特從不會這樣 從不會說著玩的
Gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.

1326
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,481
寶貝 對不起      沒事
Sweetie, I'm sorry.        It's okay.

1327
01:06:55,126 --> 01:06:58,493
我只是...      記得我們相遇的那個晚上嗎?
I just...        Remember that night we met?

1328
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:01,634
主治醫生告訴我 
The attending physician told me, 

1329
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,329
"後院有個嗑藥的皮條客"
"We got a drugged-out pimp in the back. "

1330
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:08,105
我去到後院 打開窗簾
And I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain,

1331
01:07:10,475 --> 01:07:13,357
你脆弱 害怕
You were weak, scared,

1332
01:07:13,378 --> 01:07:17,474
糟透了 發炎 傷心地哭著
ass up, inflamed, crying.

1333
01:07:17,582 --> 01:07:19,292
那時候 我知道 
At that moment, I knew. 

1334
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,680
"嘿 他不是皮條客 皮條客才不哭呢"
"Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry. "

1335
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:28,149
皮條客不哭
Pimps don't cry

1336
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:31,986
皮條客不哭
Pimps don't cry

1337
01:07:32,097 --> 01:07:34,998
不 他們不會
No they do not

1338
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:38,336
他們不會流淚
They don't shed a tear

1339
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:44,373
皮條客才不哭
Pimps don't cry

1340
01:07:44,642 --> 01:07:46,542
他們不會流淚
They never shed a tear

1341
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:52,819
我們去床上躺躺 
Come lay with me. 

1342
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,886
會讓你有安全感 我們來做愛 來吧
Be safe, and let's make love. Come on.

1343
01:07:54,986 --> 01:07:57,386
每次你說安全感 都讓我傷心欲絕
Every time you say, "Be safe," it tears me apart.

1344
01:07:57,489 --> 01:08:00,049
你得讓我成為我要成為的人
You gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.

1345
01:08:01,659 --> 01:08:04,150
艾倫 我懷孕了
Allen, I'm pregnant.

1346
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:06,394
是誰的孩子?
Whose baby is that?

1347
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:08,128
是哪個男人把你肚子搞大的? 
Who's the man who did that to you? 

1348
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:10,497
蓋特的女人都會用套子
Gator's bitches better be using jimmies!

1349
01:08:11,803 --> 01:08:15,463
對不起 看我都說的什麼啊
I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.

1350
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:16,865
哦 老天
Oh, my God.

1351
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:19,875
你走吧
You need to leave.

1352
01:08:19,978 --> 01:08:23,573
滾 滾出去 艾倫 滾出去
Get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!

1353
01:08:40,365 --> 01:08:41,263
嘿
Hey

1354
01:08:42,534 --> 01:08:45,059
嘿 你在這幹嗎?
Hey. What are you doing here?

1355
01:08:47,539 --> 01:08:49,270
我有女人的問題的時候就來這 
Come here when I have lady troubles, 

1356
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,603
也就是說我每晚都來這
which means I come here about every night.

1357
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,735
你在這媟F嗎?
What are you doing here?

1358
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:58,405
希拉今晚和我吵了一架
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

1359
01:08:59,284 --> 01:09:01,582
她把我趕出來了
She threw me out.

1360
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,869
好吧 直到你老婆把你踢出家 
Well, you're not a cop 

1361
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,681
你都不是個警察 老兄
till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.

1362
01:09:05,757 --> 01:09:07,767
你在意卡斯蒂搶劫案
Does it bother you that the Castien robbers 

1363
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,093
只帶走了七萬四的鑽石嗎?
only took 74 grand in diamonds?

1364
01:09:10,128 --> 01:09:12,396
他們是垃圾 誰在乎? 我是說
They're junkies. Who cares? I mean...

1365
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:16,264
不過 我不知道一個垃圾會不會降低標準
I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.

1366
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:17,815
你們兩個怎麼樣?
How are you going?

1367
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:22,100
我們準備在那台紅色普銳斯媟d個小派對
We're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here

1368
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:23,401
如果你們願意加入的話
if you wanna join us.

1369
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:25,867
別靠近那台普銳斯 好嗎?
You're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?

1370
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:28,777
我們的意思是 一群髒兮兮的
Here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos

1371
01:09:29,214 --> 01:09:31,148
無業遊民
with fingers in each other's pooper

1372
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:34,014
在陌生人的車子堣j聲放廣播
in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.

1373
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:35,545
今晚會很不錯
It's gonna be a nice evening.

1374
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,918
好吧 我們不參加 我們沒興趣
Well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.

1375
01:09:38,122 --> 01:09:39,214
我再說一遍
Let me rephrase it.

1376
01:09:39,624 --> 01:09:42,457
我們有一罐老芥茉醬 一隻卷毛狗
We got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle,

1377
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,973
我們過去 然後在上面畫些"D" "A"什麼的

You wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?

1460

Because he was hooking up with the Powerball girl,

1503
01:16:11,282 --> 01:16:13,580
電視上滾球的那個
the one on TV with all the numbered balls.

1504
01:16:13,684 --> 01:16:16,275
是 她上周申請了法院制止令
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him last week.

1505
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,185
是時候當面和你們說了
It was right there in front of you the whole time.

1506
01:16:18,256 --> 01:16:20,224
不會吧      你們被調走了
Can't be.        You guys are getting transferred.

1507
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,418
什麼?      交警
What?        Traffic.

1508
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:23,788
是 沒錯
Yeah, that's right.

1509
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:26,128
你 你要在城內日常巡邏 
You, you're gonna walk a beat downtown. 

1510

你要在城內日常巡邏
You're gonna walk a beat downtown.

1511

It's done. No.        Captain, what are you talking about?

1512
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:29,872
不 不 說完了
No, no. It's done.

1513
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:31,966
給你們省點油      長官
Save yourselves some gas.        Captain!

1514
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:33,702
我們有沒有申訴程序
Is there an appeal process we can...

1515
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:36,934
你得做你應該做的 長官
Had to do what you had to do, Captain.

1516

哇 真夠慘的
Wow! That hurt.

1517
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:43,540
不好意思 我車哪去了      他們拖走了
Excuse me. Where's my car?        They towed it.

1518
01:16:43,614 --> 01:16:46,082
一些無家可歸的人在上面搗亂
Couple of homeless people were messing around in it.

1519
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,813
那是一輛正式的警車      也就騙騙我
That's an official police car.        Could have fooled me.

1520
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:56,256
哇 毛奇很生氣 嗯?
Wow, Mauch was upset, huh?

1521
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:57,954
是嗎?
Really?

1522
01:16:58,062 --> 01:16:59,817
我在我老婆面前唯一值得驕傲的事 
The only thing I had to be proud of in my life

1523
01:16:59,818 --> 01:17:00,709
就是我當了探員
 was being a detective.

1524
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:03,058
我只有這個了 現在這也沒了
That was all I had. Now it's gone.

1525
01:17:03,801 --> 01:17:06,292
我知道 我知道 你還有我
I know. I know. You still got me.

1526
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:09,931
你還不明白嗎? 我不需要你 我從來都不需要你
Don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.

1527
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:12,237
我告訴過你 腳手架違規的事是狗屎
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.

1528
01:17:12,576 --> 01:17:14,795
我不敢相信 我們幹了這麼多事後 你還是質疑我
I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.

1529
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,453
這是個真的案子 我是真警察  
It's a real case, and I'm a real cop. 

1530
01:17:17,454 --> 01:17:19,316
我們只是查錯了方向
We just got the wrong target for Ershon.

1531
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:22,047
你帶了把哨子      這是真警察的工作
You carry a rape whistle.        This is real cop work.

1532
01:17:22,048 --> 01:17:24,585
你就沒有做過一件男人該做的事情 好嗎?
There is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?

1533
01:17:24,655 --> 01:17:28,391
你沒有槍 沒有車 沒老婆 現在你拍擋也沒了
You got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.

1534
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:29,751
讓我單獨呆會
Leave me alone.

1535
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:31,851
一個蠢案子
A mutt case.

1536
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:34,488
特 告訴你 我是個警察 好嗎?
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?

1537
01:17:34,598 --> 01:17:36,759
散伙的拍檔
A broken partnership.

1538
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:37,960
我是個警察
I'm a cop!

1539
01:17:38,035 --> 01:17:41,698
被降級到一個差勁的工作
And getting busted down to a shitty assignment.

1540
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:44,866
艾倫和特堣中F"三連彩"了
Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.

1541
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:50,705
但是有時候 當你倒霉的時候
But sometimes when you get your ass kicked,

1542
01:17:51,949 --> 01:17:54,645
這就是你發現真實的時候
that's when you find out what's real...

1543
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:59,013
需要做什麼的時候
...and what needs doing.

1544
01:18:04,962 --> 01:18:07,021
不管是指揮交通
Whether it's directing traffic...

1545
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:08,155
走呀
Come on!

1546
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:12,068
還是破了幾百萬的詐騙案
...or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.

1547
01:18:23,547 --> 01:18:25,740
你在這堣W班?      是 沒錯
Do you work here?        Yeah, I do.

1548
01:18:25,746 --> 01:18:28,549
那邊那個撞上卡斯蒂的起重球
The wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.

1549
01:18:28,652 --> 01:18:30,310
也對你的辦公室造成損壞?
They also did damage to your office?

1550
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:32,846
一些警察過來把它封上了
Some police officers came by and sealed it off.

1551
01:18:32,923 --> 01:18:34,254
你記得他們長什麼樣嗎?
Do you recall what they looked like?

1552
01:18:34,358 --> 01:18:37,054
其中一個有澳洲口音
One of them had an Australian accent.

1553
01:18:37,595 --> 01:18:41,395
你不是在州彩票工作吧?
You don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?

1554
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:44,866
不是 我們的主要客戶是蘭道公司
No. Our main client is Lendl Global.

1555
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:46,562
可以問下是怎麼回事嗎?
Can I ask what this is about?

1556
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,140
本月交警之星
TRAFFIC ENFORCER OF THE MONTH

1557

特堙P霍茲
Terry Hoitz

1558

蓋特需要他的槍 你個無能的賤人
Gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!

1559
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:13,722
因為真警察就是這麼回事
'Cause that's what a real cop is.

1560
01:19:13,798 --> 01:19:16,489
不 我沒說把她關起來 我絕沒說過"把她關起來"
No, I didn't say "Lock her up. " I never said, "Lock her up. "

1561
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:19,198
一個男人做了他該做的事情
A guy who does what needs to be done.

1562
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:23,229
一個男人知道怎麼善用他的黑暗面
A guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.

1563
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:24,934
然後搬去佛羅里達
And then you move to Florida.

1564

Tap out. Tap out.        It's me, Allen.

1567
01:19:41,725 --> 01:19:43,283
你放不放開 還是你要打我的臉?
Are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?

1568
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:45,055
我放開了
I'm tapping out!

1569
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:48,956
你瘋了嗎? 你在這幹嗎 兄弟?
You crazy? What are you doing, man?

1570
01:19:49,066 --> 01:19:50,499
他們可能在監視我們      我可能會殺了你
They might be watching us.        Could've killed you.

1571
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:52,097
關燈      什麼?
Turn out the lights.        What?

1572
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:52,994
他們可能在監視      誰?
They could be watching us.        Who?

1573
01:19:53,237 --> 01:19:55,762
我發現一些重要的消息 好嗎?
I found some big information, okay?

1574
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,968
關於什麼?      重要信息 特 驚天大秘密
About what?        Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.

1575
01:19:59,276 --> 01:20:02,074
你怎麼進來的? 這地方有安全自鎖裝置的
How'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.

1576
01:20:02,146 --> 01:20:04,614
我們得更小心      你在說什麼?
We can't be too careful.        What are you talking about?

1577
01:20:04,682 --> 01:20:07,845
這地方可能被竊聽      這堥S有竊聽器
This place might be bugged.        There's no bugs in here.

1578
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:15,115
首先 我想你
First off, I missed you.

1579
01:20:15,192 --> 01:20:17,990
發生什麼事了?      你聽到我說什麼了嗎?
What's going on?        Did you hear what I said?

1580
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:22,088
好吧 我也有點想你      謝謝
Fine, I kind of missed you, too.        Thank you.

1581
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:26,466
好吧 我知道厄森在掩蓋誰的損失
Okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.

1582
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:28,835
是蘭道公司      什麼?
It's Lendl Global.        What?

1583
01:20:28,939 --> 01:20:31,464
蘭道用卡斯蒂搶劫案分散注意
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction

1584
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:34,534
所以他們可以闖進他們隔壁自己的會計事務所
so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.

1585
01:20:34,645 --> 01:20:37,842
然後他們調換了記錄來掩蓋
They then altered all the records to cover the losses

1586
01:20:37,948 --> 01:20:40,712
厄森投資失敗的損失
that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.

1587
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:42,559
你不應該做這事的 
You're not supposed to be doing this. 

1588
01:20:43,145 --> 01:20:44,658
你應該巡街的
You're supposed to be walking the beat.

1589
01:20:44,693 --> 01:20:47,249
我知道 不過很機智吧 嗯?
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?

1590
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:49,483
這不好 艾倫 這不好
This is bad, Allen. This is bad.

1591
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,028
難怪長官想讓我們不要管這個
No wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.

1592
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:54,522
是的 我想比曼開始質疑了
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.

1593
01:20:54,531 --> 01:20:56,299
這就是他們殺他的原因      老天
That's why they killed him.        Man.

1594
01:20:56,367 --> 01:20:57,527
還有件事
Here's the other thing.

1595
01:20:57,635 --> 01:20:59,626
明天 會有一單大生意
Tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.

1596
01:20:59,837 --> 01:21:01,202
厄森主導
Ershon's leading it.

1597
01:21:01,305 --> 01:21:02,511
我還是不知道
I still can't figure out 

1598
01:21:02,512 --> 01:21:04,173
他們在和哪個可憐的傢伙做生意
who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with,

1599
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:05,401
但是我們得阻止這單生意
but we gotta stop it.

1600
01:21:05,509 --> 01:21:07,170
是時候讓孔雀飛起來了
It's time to let the peacock fly.

1601
01:21:08,212 --> 01:21:10,077
我不去 艾倫 我喜歡我現在做的
I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.

1602
01:21:10,514 --> 01:21:12,641
我也是 我們是警察
So do I. We're cops.

1603
01:21:12,716 --> 01:21:17,594
不 我喜歡我現在做的 我喜歡做交警 很不錯
No. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.

1604
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:18,378
什麼?
What?

1605
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:22,805
我喜歡指揮交通 我不和你去
I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.

1606
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,351
指揮個屁交通?
What is this traffic bullshit?

1607
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:32,693
你在說什麼?      我在說我的人生
What are you talking about?        I'm talking about my life.

1608
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:35,920
我管的54街和第3大道的路口 很忙的
The corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.

1609
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:39,410
這是特堛漱Q字路口 其實交警呢? 他們是好人
It's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.

1610
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:42,402
有一個傢伙 菲利浦? 他可以離便池20英尺尿尿
There's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.

1611
01:21:42,513 --> 01:21:44,073
你得看看 艾倫 你得看看
You've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.

1612
01:21:44,074 --> 01:21:46,685
你怎麼回事? 我們的時光怎麼了?
What happened to you? What happened to this being our time?

1613
01:21:46,686 --> 01:21:48,845
不行 艾倫 我退出 我不幹了
No way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.

1614
01:21:50,087 --> 01:21:52,954
上車      拜託 艾倫 我們都知道這是木槍
Get in the car.        Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.

1615
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:58,359
離開這 現在上車      你不會開槍打我的
Apartment pop. Now get in the car.        You're not gonna shoot me.

1616
01:21:58,429 --> 01:22:01,284
好吧 我老實說 這是我第二次開槍
Okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.

1617
01:22:01,288 --> 01:22:02,492
那別指著我了
So stop pointing it at me.

1618
01:22:02,516 --> 01:22:06,927
聽著 明天早上 我只知道我要去找毛奇 好嗎?
Look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?

1619
01:22:06,928 --> 01:22:07,980
為了什麼? 他不在乎
For what? He doesn't care.

1620
01:22:08,038 --> 01:22:11,201
他迴避這個案子很久了 我需要答案
He's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.

1621
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:13,539
我要他看著我的眼睛 告訴我為什麼
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.

1622
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:16,409
看看新聞 兄弟 沒人在乎
Turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.

1623
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:18,446
我希望我不是一個人
I hope I'm not alone.

1624
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,775
希望你能帶上膽子
Hope you bring it.

1625
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:25,614
今天是個重大的日子 大日子
We got a big day out there. Big one.

1626
01:22:25,723 --> 01:22:28,614
是滿月 人們會很有購物慾的 好嗎?
We got a full moon. People are gonna be amped, all right?

1627
01:22:28,642 --> 01:22:31,083
我們來看看有什麼熱門的提示 好嗎?
Let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?

1628
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,122
新的浴室防滑墊進來了
The new bathmats are in.

1629
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:40,765
還有件事 我們在皇家高地有一個連環強姦犯
One more thing. We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.

1630
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:44,330
老天 對不起 這是我另外的工作 別管它 別管
Jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.

1631
01:22:44,441 --> 01:22:45,601
好吧 也不要不管
Well, don't ignore it.

1632
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:48,907
如果你住在皇家高地的話 你知道 結伴同行
If you live in Crown Heights, you know, walk in pairs.

1633
01:22:48,979 --> 01:22:51,262
吉恩·毛奇去廚房配件區 
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.

1634
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:53,314
吉恩·毛奇去廚房配件區
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories. 

1635
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:57,012
我得走了 加油 在外面小心點
I gotta go. Go get 'em. Let's be careful out there.

1636
01:22:59,089 --> 01:23:00,249
橡樹類
The oak.

1637
01:23:00,324 --> 01:23:04,271
我想要把橡樹類的放一起 和楓樹類分開 好嗎?
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?

1638
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:05,519
還有這些切菜板?
And these chopping boards?

1639
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,354
嘿 長官
Hey, Captain.

1640
01:23:07,798 --> 01:23:10,323
嘿 艾倫 怎麼樣?
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?

1641
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:12,347
你來幹嗎? 來買新的浴室防滑墊?
What are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?

1642
01:23:12,703 --> 01:23:16,366
我需要你坦白告訴我      我們之間坦白
I need you to be straight with me.        Straight with us.

1643
01:23:16,473 --> 01:23:19,169
嘿 特 看看你們倆
Hey, Terry. Look at this.

1644
01:23:19,276 --> 01:23:22,939
我以為你要指揮交通      讓他們堵著吧
I thought you were working traffic today.        Let them block the box.

1645
01:23:23,347 --> 01:23:26,805
另外 搭檔章程 對吧?      謝謝
Besides, partners' code, right?        Thanks.

1646
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:31,046
嘿 為什麼你非要將這個案子終止?
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?

1647
01:23:32,389 --> 01:23:35,483
好吧 好吧 我來告訴你們些事情
All right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.

1648
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:38,858
你們真的查得很深 查得很深
You really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.

1649
01:23:38,962 --> 01:23:40,896
厄森和上層都有聯絡
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups,

1650
01:23:40,998 --> 01:23:44,285
我得為自己留條後路 好嗎?
and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?

1651
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:46,662
雖然你現在一直對外界隱瞞這些骯髒的事情
You keep hiding from shit in the world,

1652
01:23:46,737 --> 01:23:49,351
但最終事情還是會被揭發的
and eventually the world comes to your front door.

1653
01:23:49,473 --> 01:23:51,803
很好      說得真好
Nice.        That's very nice.

1654
01:23:51,809 --> 01:23:53,867
這是我從某集《天使在人間》媥ヮ茠漸x詞
I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.

1655
01:23:53,911 --> 01:23:55,563
如果你們能悄悄地調查這事 
You keep this thing real quiet, 

1656
01:23:55,645 --> 01:23:57,905
並找到確鑿的證據
and you make sure you have real evidence,

1657
01:23:58,015 --> 01:23:59,873
那或許我可以看看有什麼能幫得上忙的
and maybe I'll see what I can do.

1658
01:23:59,883 --> 01:24:00,877
但如果你們大張旗鼓
But if you make a lot of noise

1659
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:04,147
引來媒體的注意 把地方檢察官也牽扯進來
and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,

1660
01:24:04,221 --> 01:24:06,045
那就不用來找我幫忙了 明白了嗎?
I am out, okay?

1661
01:24:06,089 --> 01:24:07,186
行 我們會安靜得像教堂堛漲揤咫@樣
Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.

1662
01:24:07,257 --> 01:24:10,923
但職業生涯中總有那麼一個案子 
But there's one case, one case in a career 

1663
01:24:10,924 --> 01:24:12,950
是他會傾盡全力去調查的 現在就是這樣
where you go all in. This is it.

1664
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:16,763
很好 那就做給我們看吧
All right. Then you do us proud.

1665
01:24:17,267 --> 01:24:18,714
因為我不需要"二流警探"
'Cause I don't want no scrubs.

1666
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:21,829
真的?      是的
Really?        No.

1667
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:23,997
你沒發現這是首TLC樂隊的歌?
You're not aware that's a TLC song?

1668
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,583
我不知道你在說什麼
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1669
01:24:25,618 --> 01:24:26,908
第二次了      你說不要逞能
Second time.        You said chasing waterfalls,

1670
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:28,170
現在你又說你不需要二流警探
now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.

1671
01:24:28,245 --> 01:24:30,042
我都不知道那是什麼來的      這是個口頭禪
I don't even understand the reference.        It's like a tic.

1672
01:24:30,114 --> 01:24:31,240
我不知道你在說什麼
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1673
01:24:31,348 --> 01:24:34,012
記住 如果這事捅婁子了 就當我們從未談過這事
Remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.

1674
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:35,746
你可以相信我們      必須暗地埵璅
You can trust us.        Real quiet.

1675
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:38,317
小心謹慎 悄無聲息知道嗎
You gotta creep. Creep.

1676
01:24:38,389 --> 01:24:39,686
又來了
Come on.

1677
01:24:40,624 --> 01:24:41,955
除非你是在引用TLC的歌詞 
You don't say "Creep-creep" 

1678
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:43,595
不然你不會說"悄無生息"
unless you're quoting TLC.

1679
01:24:43,596 --> 01:24:44,759
嘿 夥計們
Hey, guys.

1680
01:24:45,729 --> 01:24:47,894
你們知道丹森和海史密斯不是好警察吧?
You know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?

1681
01:24:48,265 --> 01:24:50,062
是的 我們知道 但也是沒辦法的
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.

1682
01:24:50,134 --> 01:24:52,034
我是說 剩下的人媮晹魚眽鈰筏^雄呢
I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?

1683
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:55,832
雖然我不想說 但有可能是你們倆
Not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.

1684
01:24:56,974 --> 01:24:58,532
你準備好了嗎
You ready?

1685
01:24:58,609 --> 01:25:00,270
好了      我們走
Yeah.        Let's go.

1686
01:25:08,786 --> 01:25:11,152
不 挑染的部分很好看      謝謝
No, but the highlights are great.        Thank you.

1687
01:25:11,255 --> 01:25:13,414
性感但又很莊重      謝謝
Sexy but serious.        Thank you.

1688
01:25:13,424 --> 01:25:14,789
打擾一下
Excuse me.

1689
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:18,455
這他媽都是些什麼人? 我只想見一個人而已
Who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.

1690
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:23,056
呃 就是一些人我欠了他們錢 他們自己要來的
You know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.

1691
01:25:23,643 --> 01:25:24,625
他們是誰?
Who are they?

1692
01:25:25,736 --> 01:25:30,435
呃 車臣的一些愛國者 還有一些企業家
Well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.

1693
01:25:30,507 --> 01:25:36,343
然後那些黑人小伙子是從尼日利亞來的
And the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.

1694
01:25:36,447 --> 01:25:39,182
你欠尼日利亞人跟車臣人的錢?
You owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?

1695
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:40,459
呃 是的 我欠他們錢
Yes. Yes, I do.

1696
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:43,480
你有兩下子嘛      謝謝
You're a piece of work.        Thank you.

1697
01:25:43,654 --> 01:25:47,021
我們最好還是開始吧
Probably best to get started.

1698
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:50,916
這樣不錯 夥計 我們已經入局了 而且知道比分
This is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.

1699
01:25:50,994 --> 01:25:52,218
唯一讓我不爽的是
The only thing that bugs me is

1700
01:25:52,219 --> 01:25:53,930
我還是不知道厄森的目標是什麼
 we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.

1701
01:25:53,997 --> 01:25:56,312
是彩票嗎? 幕後又是誰?
Is it the lotto? Who is it?

1702
01:25:56,313 --> 01:25:58,494
誰在乎? 肯定是某個有錢的蠢蛋
Who cares? Some rich prick.

1703
01:25:58,494 --> 01:26:04,229
我必須告訴你們 我對於這個交易很興奮
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.

1704
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,776
我可以跟你們保證你們投入的每一分錢
And I can assure you that every dime of your money

1705
01:26:06,777 --> 01:26:10,043
都將被最大限度的利用
will be invested with the utmost diligence.

1706
01:26:10,044 --> 01:26:11,848
你們給出的回報率確實很讓人興奮
Your rates of return are really exciting.

1707
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:13,473
我們的成員們一定會眼前一亮
We think our members are gonna be just thrilled.

1708
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:18,084
是的 過去十年的平均回報率  差不多有18%
Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.

1709
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:20,684
我們現在要像教堂的老鼠 安靜得進去再出來
All right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.

1710
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:23,125
我現在可以感受到你說的那種蛋疼的性奮
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.

1711
01:26:23,126 --> 01:26:24,184
很好
Beautiful.

1712
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:25,693
好了 你們聽著
All right, listen up.

1713
01:26:25,796 --> 01:26:28,697
我是甘博探員 這位是霍茲探員
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.

1714
01:26:28,799 --> 01:26:30,960
我們需要你們的配合
We need your cooperation.

1715
01:26:31,034 --> 01:26:32,501
大衛·厄森
David Ershon.

1716
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:34,901
你因詐騙和貪污
You're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement,

1717
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:37,100
以及涉嫌唐·比曼被殺一案被捕了
and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.

1718
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:38,640
這不是個好主意
This is a bad idea.

1719
01:26:39,142 --> 01:26:40,507
嘿 夥計們
Hey, guys.

1720
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:44,547
鮑勃? 你在這幹什麼?
Bob? What are you doing here?

1721
01:26:45,015 --> 01:26:46,346
我在投資啊
I'm investing.

1722
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:49,150
你們還記得我們之前談到的代理人投票那事嗎?
Do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?

1723
01:26:49,151 --> 01:26:50,896
說的就是這事      見鬼
This is what it was for.        Holy shit.

1724
01:26:50,897 --> 01:26:53,379
這只是一個更冒險的撫恤金投資
It's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.

1725
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:57,489
艾倫! 我們太蠢了 他們的目標是警察的撫恤金
Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.

1726
01:27:03,834 --> 01:27:07,933
先生們 你們無權來這兒 而且也沒有授權令
Gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.

1727
01:27:08,372 --> 01:27:10,439
我們有權採取行動
We are within our rights to take action.

1728
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:10,248
不能再像教堂堛漲揤咫F!
So much for quiet as church mice!

1729
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:11,693
跑!
Go!

1730
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,205
那些人他媽的到底是誰?
Who the hell are those guys?

1731
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:18,822
先生們 
Gentlemen, 

1732
01:28:18,823 --> 01:28:21,336
我可以搞到搖滾年代的票 不過視野不太好
I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.

1733
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:23,221
雖然我也承認那沒吸引力 
Even I admit that's not very tempting, 

1734
01:28:23,222 --> 01:28:25,371
但我也不是什麼票都能弄到的 該死的!
but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!

1735
01:28:25,449 --> 01:28:27,683
到前座去      你是怎麼想到的?
Get in the front!        How do you start this freaking thing?

1736
01:28:27,684 --> 01:28:28,673
快點!快!
Go on! Go!

1737
01:28:29,419 --> 01:28:30,768
媽的!      快開!
Shit!        Go!

1738
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:33,878
哦 天...
Oh, my...

1739
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:38,639
吉妮! 過來! 你 去把車開來!
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!

1740
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:25,730
抓住方向盤!
Hold the wheel!

1741
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:33,814
打開後備箱!      知道了 我知道了!
Open the back!        I got it. I got it!

1742
01:29:41,825 --> 01:29:44,760
他們會殺了我 然後再來殺你們
They're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.

1743
01:29:44,861 --> 01:29:47,261
我會先殺了你的!      然後他們會再殺我一次
Well, I'm gonna kill you first!        And then they will kill me.

1744
01:29:47,364 --> 01:29:50,390
現有兩名游手好閒的警察 他們佩有槍支很危險
We have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous,

1745
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,161
並且挾持了大衛·厄森      愚蠢的有錢人!
and holding David Ershon hostage.        Stupid pricks!

1746
01:29:52,235 --> 01:29:55,807
是我們 我們是好警察      沒錯 他們是好警察
It's us, we're good guys!        Exactly. They're the good guys.

1747
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,000
我們去哪? 我們去哪?
Where do we go? Where do we go?

1748
01:29:58,075 --> 01:30:00,737
我有一個小公寓 沒人知道那
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.

1749
01:30:00,844 --> 01:30:03,540
只有我父母跟妓女住過
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.

1750
01:30:03,613 --> 01:30:06,036
不是同時 那樣就麻煩了
Not at the same time. That would be wrong.

1751
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:11,648
你就從頭說起吧
Let's hear it from the top, every detail.

1752
01:30:12,222 --> 01:30:14,094
我覺得講故事的最好方法就是
I think the best way to tell the story is 

1753
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,113
從結尾開始簡單敘述
by starting at the end, briefly,

1754
01:30:17,114 --> 01:30:19,354
然後回到開頭
then going back to the beginning, 

1755
01:30:19,842 --> 01:30:22,149
再階段性地總結跟結尾的關係
and then periodically returning to the end,

1756
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:25,092
或許在過程中還應該給出不同角色的一些觀點
maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.

1757
01:30:25,202 --> 01:30:27,006
這樣才比較生動 
Just to give it a bit of dynamism, 

1758
01:30:27,007 --> 01:30:28,571
否則 那就是一個單調的故事
otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.

1759
01:30:28,572 --> 01:30:29,732
快告訴我們到底發生了什麼事
Just tell us what happened.

1760
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,742
我損失掉了某些人的一大筆錢 
I lost a bunch of money from some people 

1761
01:30:31,743 --> 01:30:33,018
現在他們想要拿回那筆錢
and now they want it back.

1762
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:34,206
那唐·比曼是怎麼回事?
What about Don Beaman?

1763
01:30:34,277 --> 01:30:36,868
比曼知道我篡改了一些我的財務報表
Beaman knew that I had falsified my financials,

1764
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,578
所以他們派了韋斯利來封他的口
so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.

1765
01:30:39,883 --> 01:30:41,938
韋斯利用槍對著他逼他喝了好多杜松子酒
He forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin

1766
01:30:41,939 --> 01:30:44,077
再把他逼上了窗台
and then forced him onto the ledge.

1767
01:30:44,078 --> 01:30:45,683
他什麼時候掉下去只是時間的問題
It was only a matter of time before he fell.

1768
01:30:45,756 --> 01:30:49,192
至少我們阻止了你得到那筆撫恤金
At least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.

1769
01:30:49,259 --> 01:30:52,574
嗯 不對 你們沒能阻止 那筆錢已在我賬戶堣F
Well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.

1770
01:30:52,596 --> 01:30:55,790
到早上9點 那筆錢匯入了蘭道自有基金
By 9:00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund

1771
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:58,061
然後從那個基金匯給好幾個海外賬戶
and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.

1772
01:30:58,068 --> 01:30:59,592
9點01分之前 這些錢就都會被轉走
By 9:01, it's gone.

1773
01:30:59,703 --> 01:31:02,695
那如果我們阻止轉賬呢?      但你們不能阻止
Well, what if we stop the transfer?        But you can't.

1774
01:31:02,773 --> 01:31:05,241
那如果我們阻止轉賬呢?
What if we stop the transfer?

1775
01:31:05,308 --> 01:31:08,669
你們必須在9點整時出現在地方銀行
You'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9:00 exactly,

1776
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,836
找到那個辦事員 拿到分行代號
find the clerk, get the routing number.

1777
01:31:10,837 --> 01:31:11,872
我們必須阻止這件事
We gotta stop it.

1778
01:31:11,948 --> 01:31:13,142
但那不可能
There's no way.

1779
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,645
每一個警察 還有那個澳大利亞瘋子和他的手下
Every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, 

1780
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:16,871
都會來追捕我們
they'll all be after us.

1781
01:31:16,953 --> 01:31:21,199
你們可以放我走 我給你們每人一百萬
You could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.

1782
01:31:21,658 --> 01:31:24,718
這不是賄賂      這就是賄賂
It's not a bribe.        Of course it's a bribe.

1783
01:31:24,795 --> 01:31:27,222
你試圖給我們錢讓我們不要完成我們的工作
You're offering to pay us money to not do our job.

1784
01:31:28,999 --> 01:31:30,261
這不是賄賂
It's not a bribe.

1785
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:33,301
我們今晚低調行事 沒人知道這個地方
We hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.

1786
01:31:33,403 --> 01:31:35,442
我們會很安全 然後明天我們就去銀行
We'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.

1787
01:31:35,906 --> 01:31:37,600
但首先 我要去見見希拉
First things first, I gotta go see Sheila.

1788
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:38,906
不行 那很危險
No way, it's too dangerous.

1789
01:31:39,009 --> 01:31:41,307
聽著 特 我們都不知道明天會發生什麼
Look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow,

1790
01:31:41,411 --> 01:31:44,938
但今晚 我必須去見希拉對她有個交代
but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.

1791
01:31:45,448 --> 01:31:47,748
好吧 去吧 去吧 小心點
All right, go. Go. Be careful.

1792
01:31:47,818 --> 01:31:49,445
謝謝 我會的
Thanks, I will.

1793
01:31:50,287 --> 01:31:51,515
你會幫我跟希拉問好嗎?
Will you say hi to Sheila for me?

1794
01:31:51,688 --> 01:31:53,451
好的      很好
Okay.        Okay.

1795
01:31:53,523 --> 01:31:56,492
告訴她說 特埵陸搯_過她
Tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.

1796
01:31:56,593 --> 01:31:58,026
他希望你知道
He wants to make sure you know

1797
01:31:58,128 --> 01:32:00,494
不管發生什麼事他都會在你需要時出現的
that he'll be there for you if anything happens.

1798
01:32:00,597 --> 01:32:02,656
好      危急關頭我會立馬出現
Yeah.        Drop of a hat, I'm there.

1799
01:32:02,866 --> 01:32:04,857
聽著 夥計 再往下說就有些奇怪了
Look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.

1800
01:32:04,968 --> 01:32:07,869
如果你發生了什麼事 我必須照顧她
If something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.

1801
01:32:07,971 --> 01:32:11,012
她所有想要的東西 需求 渴望我都會滿足她
All of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.

1802
01:32:11,014 --> 01:32:13,135
你幹嘛說得好像是事先就決定好的事情?
Why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?

1803
01:32:13,343 --> 01:32:14,708
去吧 夥計
Just go, man.

1804
01:32:15,445 --> 01:32:17,335
好的 謝謝
Okay. Thanks.

1805
01:32:17,881 --> 01:32:18,973
去吧
Go.

1806
01:32:22,953 --> 01:32:24,213
雅內可美術館
Janeco Gallery.

1807
01:32:25,055 --> 01:32:27,148
弗朗辛 我是特 別掛電話
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.

1808
01:32:37,868 --> 01:32:39,028
接電話吧
Please pick up.

1809
01:32:39,903 --> 01:32:41,063
喂
Hello.

1810
01:32:41,171 --> 01:32:44,334
嘿 親愛的 我猜你在你媽媽家
Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.

1811
01:32:44,407 --> 01:32:48,042
你知道嗎 我不能說太多 我猜這電話被竊聽了
You know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.

1812
01:32:48,043 --> 01:32:50,502
寶貝 你在哪? 我想見你
Baby, where are you? I wanna see you.

1813
01:32:50,513 --> 01:32:53,174
我在我們上次萬聖節做了三次的那個地方
I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.

1814
01:32:53,175 --> 01:32:54,107
記得嗎?
Do you remember?

1815
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:56,150
哦 記得
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1816
01:32:56,219 --> 01:32:57,436
我是來告誡你 
I'm just warning you, though.

1817
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,252
要小心 我覺得他們在監視你們
 Watch out. I think they're watching the house.

1818
01:33:00,287 --> 01:33:02,617
別擔心 親愛的 我想我有辦法跟你說話
Don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.

1819
01:33:03,059 --> 01:33:06,995
我得說 我不想來的 我是說...
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...

1820
01:33:08,164 --> 01:33:11,600
這麼多年來的限制令什麼的
After all those years, after the restraining order.

1821
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:15,068
我擔心我可能再也見不到你了
I was worried I might not see you again.

1822
01:33:15,171 --> 01:33:16,763
一些很危險的人在找他
There's some very dangerous people after him,

1823
01:33:16,873 --> 01:33:18,297
現在他們在找我們
and now they're after us.

1824
01:33:21,111 --> 01:33:22,510
只是個老女人
It's just the old lady.

1825
01:33:28,084 --> 01:33:29,517
你好 艾倫
Hello, Allen.

1826
01:33:29,586 --> 01:33:32,180
你好 羅馬斯媽媽 你來外面做什麼呢?
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?

1827
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:35,999
希拉說她不明白發生了什麼事 她想要你回去
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.

1828
01:33:36,693 --> 01:33:38,558
她還說...      嗯
She also says...        Yes.

1829
01:33:38,628 --> 01:33:42,462
...她想讓你在她的上面 捧著她的頭髮
...she wants you on top of her, holding her hair,

1830
01:33:42,565 --> 01:33:44,990
像騎一匹難馴的馬那樣騎著她
and riding her like a bucking bronco

1831
01:33:45,235 --> 01:33:49,164
她吮吸你的大拇指說著"媽媽喜歡"
while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey. "

1832
01:33:49,706 --> 01:33:51,664
你告訴你的女兒...
You, you tell your daughter...

1833
01:33:51,665 --> 01:33:54,075
他說他會一直愛你
He said he'll always love you.

1834
01:33:54,144 --> 01:33:56,806
他很高興你有了他的孩子
And he's so happy that you're having his child.

1835
01:33:56,913 --> 01:33:58,073
艾倫
Allen.

1836
01:33:58,148 --> 01:33:59,979
他還說
He also says that

1837
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:02,846
他要你做那事的時候
he wants you to stare into each other's eyes 

1838
01:34:02,847 --> 01:34:04,851
相互看著對方的眼睛不要眨眼
without blinking while you do it.

1839
01:34:04,854 --> 01:34:07,374
我愛極了我們做愛的那一刻 媽媽      這之後
I love when we do that, Mom.        And then afterward,

1840
01:34:07,657 --> 01:34:09,625
他說要互相口交
lick the sex off each other.

1841
01:34:11,194 --> 01:34:13,094
我不想幹了
I don't wanna do this.

1842
01:34:14,497 --> 01:34:16,746
你們講話太肉麻了
You say things that are too personal.

1843
01:34:16,747 --> 01:34:18,523
但這是最後一次
Okay, but just one more thing.

1844
01:34:18,524 --> 01:34:20,168
她說她愛你
She said she loves you,

1845
01:34:20,236 --> 01:34:23,630
想要和你牽著手一起喝冰茶
and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.

1846
01:34:24,007 --> 01:34:26,852
拜託 那不是她說的吧
Come on. That's not all she said.

1847
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:28,204
不是
No.

1848
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:32,874
她說了別的 但是我不想...      求求你說吧
She says other things, but I don't want...        Please, please, please.

1849
01:34:32,949 --> 01:34:35,363
你不知道嗎 明天我可能就被殺了
You don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.

1850
01:34:35,685 --> 01:34:36,879
好吧
Okay.

1851
01:34:39,422 --> 01:34:44,591
她說她想關掉所有的鍾和電話
She says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones

1852
01:34:44,592 --> 01:34:47,892
來一次三天的做愛馬拉松      這才像她說的
and have a three-day F marathon.        That's more like it. Yeah.

1853
01:34:47,897 --> 01:34:53,102
她想一周都下不了床 因為你們做得太激烈了
She wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.

1854
01:34:53,103 --> 01:34:54,331
太美好了
That's just lovely.

1855
01:34:54,738 --> 01:34:58,367
夠了! 他說的話我沒法說
No more! He says things I can't say.

1856
01:34:58,441 --> 01:35:00,793
又是仿真手 
It involves a mannequin hand 

1857
01:35:00,794 --> 01:35:04,410
又是高爾夫球棒 還綁著什麼電動剃鬚刀
and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.

1858
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:13,814
她又說了什麼?
Now what'd she say?

1859
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:18,055
她說她愛你
She says she loves you.

1860
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,632
這一切我深感抱歉
I'm so sorry about everything.

1861
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:32,042
我今晚只是來這兒告訴你 我愛你
And I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.

1862
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,911
我把你當做一個平凡的妻子是因為
And the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that

1863
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:41,641
我怕如果我承認你是多麼的漂亮
I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning

1864
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:44,549
多麼的聰明 多麼的美妙
and intelligent and wonderful you are,

1865
01:35:45,422 --> 01:35:49,606
我就會失去你      別說了 艾倫 我愛你
I'd just lose you.        Shut up, Allen. I love you.

1866
01:35:49,759 --> 01:35:52,557
有個很安全的地方
We have a place that's safe. All right.

1867
01:36:05,108 --> 01:36:06,336
我要操紅你的小屁屁
I'm gonna break your hip.

1868
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:18,016
輪到爺爺上陣啦
I'm about to do you grandpa-style.

1869
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,240
早上8點36分
轉賬前24分鐘

1870
01:36:32,836 --> 01:36:34,463
我帶了點兒音樂來
I brought some music.

1871
01:36:38,975 --> 01:36:40,966
不是我原本想要的 不過就這樣吧
Not what I would've chosen, but screw it.

1872
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:44,309

出發吧
Let's do it.

1874
01:36:45,615 --> 01:36:47,344
你要我大門密碼嗎?      閉嘴!
You want my gate code?        Shut up, man!

1875
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:55,983
那是韋斯利!
That's Wesley!

1876
01:37:07,036 --> 01:37:08,128
成功穿越!
Yes!

1877
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:13,065
你從哪兒學來這樣開車的?      《俠盜車手》
Where'd you learn to drive like that?        Grand Theft Auto!

1878
01:37:16,012 --> 01:37:17,290
靠 艾倫 他們來了
Shit, Allen, they're coming.

1879
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:22,710
哦 天哪!      靠
Oh, my God!        Shit.

1880
01:37:23,987 --> 01:37:26,242
做點什麼吧 艾倫!      穩住 穩住
Do something, Allen!        Hold on, hold on.

1881
01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:49,074
他玩了《俠盜車手》那招啊
Someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.

1882
01:37:50,747 --> 01:37:52,078
我成功了!
I did that!

1883
01:37:52,182 --> 01:37:53,843
我成功了!      哦 天哪!
I did that!        Oh, my God!

1884
01:37:53,917 --> 01:37:56,265
我就說嘛!      他們翻車嘍!
That's what I'm talking about!        We jackknifed them!

1885
01:37:56,286 --> 01:37:58,777
看到了嗎? 它向後退然後就翻了車
Did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.

1886
01:37:58,888 --> 01:38:00,935
蓋特把貨車翻了過來 
Gator turns vans upside-down 

1887
01:38:00,936 --> 01:38:02,650
車就好像進了個超級無敵洗衣機
like they're in a crazy washing machine!

1888
01:38:02,659 --> 01:38:05,243
為什麼你要叫自己蓋特?
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

1889
01:38:05,261 --> 01:38:07,825
那是我在大學時的昵稱 用於一些約會服務
It's a nickname I had in college. I used to run a dating service.

1890
01:38:07,897 --> 01:38:11,094
他是個皮條客      是的 我以前是個皮條客
He was a pimp.        Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.

1891
01:38:11,234 --> 01:38:13,702
是我身上有味道還是車本身就一股鹿的陰道味?
Is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?

1892
01:38:14,737 --> 01:38:15,863
我可憐的車啊
My poor car.

1893
01:38:16,206 --> 01:38:18,674
現在整個街區面臨一場屠殺
Right now the streets are a bloodbath.

1894
01:38:18,775 --> 01:38:21,819
統計了一下 這兒有大約30名兒童
And, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here,

1895
01:38:21,978 --> 01:38:24,269
你們中的10個將在你們下個生日前死去
10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.

1896
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:27,340
記住幾點 能讓你們遠離監獄
Got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.

1897
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:31,042
第一 千萬不要做黑人或是西班牙人
One, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.

1898
01:38:31,043 --> 01:38:34,018
這點不錯      嗯 第二...
It's a good tip.        Yeah. Two...

1899
01:38:34,123 --> 01:38:35,520
先生們 有情況
Gentlemen, we got a hot one.

1900
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:39,290
霍茲和甘博挾持了厄森 開車高速飛馳在路上
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.

1901
01:38:39,295 --> 01:38:41,283
好的! 槍 槍!
Yes! Gun, gun!

1902
01:38:41,284 --> 01:38:43,298
把槍傳過來 傳過來 出發吧 夥計
Pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.

1903
01:38:43,299 --> 01:38:44,926
我們要走了 誰有電擊槍 沒有嗎
There we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?

1904
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:46,734
很好 誰想要一起去?
Good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?

1905
01:38:46,735 --> 01:38:47,969
我!
I do!

1906
01:38:48,471 --> 01:38:49,836
好吧 就你了 甜心 來吧 我們出發 快
All right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.

1907
01:38:49,939 --> 01:38:51,633
快! 出發      快跑!
Move! Let's go.        Come on!

1908
01:39:01,684 --> 01:39:04,928
帥呆了 有架直升機! 肯定是用來高速追蹤的
Cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.

1909
01:39:09,826 --> 01:39:11,191
天哪!
Jesus!

1910
01:39:16,032 --> 01:39:19,030
那些傢伙是誰?      他們是車臣投資商
Who are those guys?        They're Chechen investors.

1911
01:39:19,031 --> 01:39:21,961
我們打算做一個《探險家朵拉》的車臣版本
We were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.

1912
01:39:22,038 --> 01:39:24,330
不管怎樣 現在已經一團糟了
Anyway, it went terribly wrong.

1913
01:39:26,809 --> 01:39:29,304
他們有架直升機 這事讓我覺得很不公平!
I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!

1914
01:39:30,013 --> 01:39:31,071
哦 不
Oh, no.

1915
01:39:32,482 --> 01:39:33,540
該死的
Damn it.

1916
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:40,188
注意你的腦袋 天哪 你的頭髮好軟
Watch your head. God, your hair is soft.

1917
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:41,822
我用的VO5護髮素
VO5 Hot Oil.

1918
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:47,299
你這準得完蛋! 兩邊都有來車
You're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!

1919
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:48,485
我才不要完蛋呢!
I'm not gonna wreck!

1920
01:39:50,233 --> 01:39:52,296
我要完蛋了! 被你說中了!      要我來開麼?
I'm gonna wreck! You're right!        You want me to drive?

1921
01:40:12,021 --> 01:40:14,683
這倒是個好主意      是啊
This was a very clever idea.        Yeah.

1922
01:40:26,769 --> 01:40:28,066
他們走了
They're gone.

1923
01:40:29,472 --> 01:40:30,564
走吧
Let's go.

1924
01:40:42,885 --> 01:40:46,481
他們是尼日利亞人 是啊 我都忘了他們了
They are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.

1925
01:40:54,197 --> 01:40:55,815
這是條捷徑      你在開玩笑吧?
This is a shortcut.        Are you kidding me?

1926
01:40:55,818 --> 01:40:57,126
你過不去的
You cannot go down there.

1927
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,130
你在幹什麼?
What are you doing?

1928
01:41:12,348 --> 01:41:13,440
撞他!
Hit him!

1929
01:41:21,157 --> 01:41:22,822
我們在哪兒呢?      切爾西碼頭
Where are we?        Chelsea Pier.

1930
01:41:28,998 --> 01:41:30,090
不是吧?
What the hell?

1931
01:41:31,434 --> 01:41:32,828
天啊!
Jesus!

1932
01:41:39,876 --> 01:41:41,927
他們那架直升飛機絕對是作弊
Them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.

1933
01:41:42,478 --> 01:41:43,536
快走!
Go!

1934
01:41:48,684 --> 01:41:49,776
快跑!
Come on!

1935
01:41:51,654 --> 01:41:53,812
我們是警察! 打那架直升飛機!
We're cops! Hit the chopper!

1936
01:42:16,145 --> 01:42:17,851
我們是馬丁和佛西 已在路上
This is Martin and Fosse, en route. 

1937
01:42:17,852 --> 01:42:19,538
都退後! 這是我們的逮捕行動!
Back off! This is our collar!

1938
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:23,702
拉起防線 在我們趕到前不准採取逮捕行動!
Set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!

1939
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,378
把警燈打開!
Take the light!

1940
01:42:45,074 --> 01:42:46,668
不要批准那項轉賬
Do not authorize that transfer.

1941
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:48,567
這是大衛·厄森 這帳是為他轉的
This is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.

1942
01:42:48,568 --> 01:42:50,847
他會讓你不要授權的 快說
He will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.

1943
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,798
快說!      對 照他們說的做 停止轉賬
Tell him!        Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.

1944
01:42:53,803 --> 01:42:54,650
不要停
Approve it.

1945
01:42:56,118 --> 01:42:57,210
就現在
Now.

1946
01:42:57,286 --> 01:42:59,287
什麼都不要動!
Do not touch anything!

1947
01:42:59,288 --> 01:43:01,552
我對天發誓 我會打得你腦袋滿桌子滾
I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.

1948
01:43:01,624 --> 01:43:04,125
這房間堥S人信你會開槍打他
Not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.

1949
01:43:04,126 --> 01:43:05,218
是嗎?
Yeah?

1950
01:43:06,596 --> 01:43:10,088
非常感謝你們把厄森先生送過來
Thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

1951
01:43:10,199 --> 01:43:13,600
我有兩筆投資商的競價
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.

1952
01:43:14,303 --> 01:43:16,833
它們值三千萬美金 還未到賬
They're at 30 million, and holding.

1953
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,208
等一下! 你就不能讓我...      把他帶走
Wait! Can't you let me...        Take him away.

1954
01:43:19,775 --> 01:43:21,299
但是計算機
But computers.

1955
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:26,880
如果有一天它們被控制了會怎麼樣?
What if, one day, they were in charge?

1956
01:43:28,451 --> 01:43:32,847
如果你現在不閉嘴 我會用黃油刀割掉你的耳朵
Now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.

1957
01:43:32,848 --> 01:43:35,015
那很鈍 鈍的比鋒利的還糟糕
That's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.

1958
01:43:35,016 --> 01:43:36,052
就現在!
Now!

1959
01:43:43,099 --> 01:43:44,259
你就站那兒別動!
You just stood there!

1960
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:47,231
我不明白"現在"指的是什麼 我要怎麼知道啊?
I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?

1961
01:43:47,236 --> 01:43:49,101
我知道是什麼意思      閉嘴
I knew what that meant.        Shut up.

1962
01:43:49,205 --> 01:43:52,231
你殺了我們就殺了厄森 你就拿不到那三千萬了
You kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.

1963
01:43:52,308 --> 01:43:54,401
現在是誰佔上風 啊?      對啊
Who's got the golden goose now, huh?        Yeah.

1964
01:43:58,447 --> 01:44:00,039
見鬼!
Shit!

1965
01:44:00,716 --> 01:44:03,267
他就算中了槍也還是有利用價值的
He's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.

1966
01:44:03,268 --> 01:44:04,817
他馬上就看穿你的把戲了
He immediately called your bluff.

1967
01:44:04,921 --> 01:44:06,802
起來 殺了那些警察
Get up. And kill the police.

1968
01:44:06,822 --> 01:44:08,549
我好像還搞不清狀況
I just wanna make sure I get it right.

1969
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:11,842
你是要批准轉賬呢還是不批准呢?
Did you want this transfer approved or not approved?

1970
01:44:12,261 --> 01:44:14,627
你 夥計 我打算殺你練練槍
You, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.

1971
01:44:16,165 --> 01:44:18,963
警察 不許動! 放下你的武器!
Police, don't move! Drop your weapons!

1972
01:44:19,068 --> 01:44:22,003
要麼放下武器 要麼橫著出去 老弟!
Drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!

1973
01:44:22,071 --> 01:44:25,366
我希望監獄的飯菜和男人能合你胃口
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.

1974
01:44:25,407 --> 01:44:27,871
警察! 跪地上別動!      把手舉起來!
Police! Down on the ground!        Let me see your hands!

1975
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:38,051
嘿 嘿 你還好吧?      嘿
Hey, hey, you okay?        Hey.

我們不在辦公室的時候你可以叫我吉恩
You can call me Gene when we're not in the office.

1979

Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.

1982

他快不行了! 他快不行了! 他快死了!
We're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!

1983
01:44:55,371 --> 01:44:57,843

不知道你在說什麼      TLC的歌名
I don't know what you're talking about.        TLC references.

01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,444
我膝蓋不太好 穩住 去啦
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.

1997

這真是傻瓜案子之最
It was the king of the mutt cases,

1998
01:45:27,603 --> 01:45:31,030
但是艾倫和特堳o視之如寶
but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.

和蘭道公司的巨大損失
and Lendl's massive losses,

2001
01:45:38,969 --> 01:45:42,128
政府啟動問題資產救助計劃出資幫助蘭道
the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.

2002
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:44,759
蘭道涉及各個領域 
Lendl is in everything, 

2003
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,537
我們會將產業擴展到各地...
and we're gonna go everywhere...

2004
01:45:46,538 --> 01:45:47,990
出資巨大不容失敗
They were too big to fail.

2005

只拍到了他們的後腦勺
It only showed the back of their heads.

2010
01:46:06,008 --> 01:46:07,761
但是艾倫的"人人後腦勺"程序
But Allen's Faceback app 

2011
01:46:07,762 --> 01:46:10,247
卻將他們的正臉與錄像對上了
was able to get a match to their faces.

2015
01:46:17,219 --> 01:46:20,586

Terry asked Sheila to be his best man, but she declined.

2017
01:46:24,536 --> 01:46:28,692
坦白說 我們都希望能成為巨星或是牛人
Let's be honest, we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.

2018
01:46:28,764 --> 01:46:29,992
但知道嗎?
But guess what?

2019
01:46:30,066 --> 01:46:33,791
那些實實在在做事 正改變著這個世界的人們
The people that do the real work, the ones that make the difference,

2020
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:36,828
你不會在電視或是頭條上看到他們
you don't see them on TV or on the front page.

2021
01:46:37,473 --> 01:46:40,931

See? That's a no-go.        Hey, hey.

2024
01:46:46,215 --> 01:46:48,206
你們以為你們破了厄森的案子?
You think you broke this Ershon case open?

2025
01:46:48,617 --> 01:46:49,845
你們什麼都沒做成
You did nothing.

2026
01:46:50,252 --> 01:46:52,042
當局遊說者動用數百萬美元

2027
01:46:52,042 --> 01:46:54,677

Yeah, it's me. You were set up that night you shot me, Terry.

2030

I told you!        They knew by putting someone like you

2031
01:47:03,733 --> 01:47:05,488
一個動輒就開槍的人
with a quick trigger finger next to that door 

2032
01:47:05,489 --> 01:47:06,703
在賽前通道
where I do my pre-game walk,

2033
01:47:06,869 --> 01:47:09,708
一定會出事 果真我倆都倒霉了
it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.

2034
01:47:09,772 --> 01:47:12,015

Now, I've been doing my own investigation on the banking industry,

2035

整個該死的系統都被他們那些髒錢給攪了
The whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.

2040
01:47:23,452 --> 01:47:26,773
新聞卻隻字不提 那是因為誰是這幕後主使?
And the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?

2041
01:47:26,856 --> 01:47:29,603
和政府幕後相同的人
The same corporations that own the government.

2042
01:47:29,892 --> 01:47:31,587
法庭和法律是我們唯一剩下的途徑了
Courts and the law is all we have left.

Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.

2058
01:48:17,807 --> 01:48:19,832
告訴我你把你的處子之身獻給了誰
Tell me who you lost your virginity to.

Heather Locklear, what?

2061
01:48:25,061 --> 01:48:26,441
你聽說過她?      不是吧!
You've heard of her?        Come on!

2062
01:48:26,515 --> 01:48:28,257
她過去還要豐滿
She was much chubbier back then.

2063
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:31,140
我想不通 我真是想不通啊
 I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.

2064

That was you. You don't have a sense of humor.

2066
01:53:32,988 --> 01:53:35,169
我有... 我不要太有幽默感哦
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.

2067
01:53:35,169 --> 01:53:36,533

All right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke.

2069
01:53:38,182 --> 01:53:39,622
來吧 我喜歡笑話
Please. I love jokes.

2070
01:53:39,657 --> 01:53:42,238
好的 有個小男孩過13歲生日了
All right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.

2071
01:53:43,398 --> 01:53:46,651
是時候破處了      有點不是時候啊
It's time to get laid.        Already feels inappropriate.

2072
01:53:46,835 --> 01:53:49,059
於是他找到妓院堛漱p姐 他說"小姐"
So he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, " Miss,

2073
01:53:49,059 --> 01:53:50,888
"瞧 我知道你通常要收錢 
"look, I know usually you want money,

2074
01:53:50,889 --> 01:53:52,655
"但我沒錢 今天又是我的生日"
"but I don't have any money and it's my birthday.

2075
01:53:52,656 --> 01:53:54,552
"我能給你這只鴨子然後跟你上床嗎?"
"Do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?"

2076
01:53:54,776 --> 01:53:57,114
他是個農民?      不是
Was he a farmer?        No.

2077
01:53:57,179 --> 01:53:59,700
他可能會違反了健康法 
That's probably a Health Code violation, 

2078
01:53:59,701 --> 01:54:01,723
帶只鴨子上妓院
bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.

2079
01:54:01,723 --> 01:54:03,565
他們不是和那只鴨子上床!
They weren't gonna have sex with the duck!

2080
01:54:03,752 --> 01:54:05,935
不 我是說帶只鴨子上那種地方
No, I just mean Health Code violation

2081
01:54:05,935 --> 01:54:09,308
違抗了健康法規
to have the duck brought into a facility like that.

2082
01:54:10,692 --> 01:54:13,003
不管怎樣 她說"可以"
So, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it. "

2083
01:54:13,395 --> 01:54:16,029
所以他做了 把第一次獻給了她
So he goes in there, gives it to her.

2084
01:54:16,398 --> 01:54:17,694
獻給她什麼?
He gives her what?

2085
01:54:17,695 --> 01:54:19,812
就是又挺又粗的那個 她愛極了
The high, hard one! She loves it.

2086
01:54:19,835 --> 01:54:21,068
她接著說 "你知道嗎? 
She goes, " You know what? 

2087
01:54:21,069 --> 01:54:23,328
"如果你再做一次 我會把你的鴨子還給你"
"If you do that again, I'll give you your duck back. "

2088
01:54:23,328 --> 01:54:25,796
所以就是免費上床兩次      呃... 抱歉
It's like getting laid twice for free.        So... I'm sorry.

2089
01:54:25,797 --> 01:54:26,635
我很抱歉
I'm so sorry.

2090
01:54:26,848 --> 01:54:30,544
那只鴨子是用來付上床的錢的      是的是的
The duck is payment for sexual intercourse.        Yes. Yes.

2091
01:54:30,712 --> 01:54:31,872
很好      他用鴨子付款
Very good.        He used the duck as payment,

2092
01:54:31,947 --> 01:54:33,819
現在他又能把鴨子要回來
and now he's being paid back the duck.

2093
01:54:33,982 --> 01:54:36,438
他說"哦 天哪 這是我最棒的生日了" 
He goes, " Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever. " 

2094
01:54:36,439 --> 01:54:37,275
他又做了一次
He does it again.

2095
01:54:37,386 --> 01:54:39,041
然後他走回家了 走走走...
Now he's walking home, right? Walking...

2096
01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:41,284
所以她對鴨子很滿意
So she was satisfied with duck.

2097
01:54:41,285 --> 01:54:43,447
鴨子當做貨幣...      是的
With a duck as currency...        Yes.

2098
01:54:43,448 --> 01:54:45,993
給她 很棒 很好
...to her. Great. Good.

2099
01:54:46,128 --> 01:54:47,348
他走回家去 
So he's walking home, 

2100
01:54:47,349 --> 01:54:50,164
現在他迫不及待想要回去告訴他爸爸
now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?

2101
01:54:50,342 --> 01:54:52,543
他和鴨子沿著街道走 突然間 轟的一聲
He's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom,

2102
01:54:52,567 --> 01:54:54,222
來了輛貨車 撞倒了他的鴨子
truck comes by and runs over his duck.

2103
01:54:54,222 --> 01:54:55,718
把鴨子殺了?      殺了
Kills the duck?        Killed the duck.

2104
01:54:55,718 --> 01:54:57,825
所以那只鴨子死了      它死了
So the duck is now dead.        The duck is dead.

2105
01:54:58,073 --> 01:55:00,381
那個孩子開始哭泣 貨車司機停下了 
The kid starts crying, truck driver stops, 

2106
01:55:00,283 --> 01:55:02,190
他很煩心 他不是故意的...      他當然會哭了
he's all upset, he didn't mean...        Of course he's crying!

2107
01:55:02,191 --> 01:55:04,822
他是個13歲的孩子 才發生過兩次性交
He's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice,

2108
01:55:04,846 --> 01:55:07,028
他看著自己摯愛的鴨子死掉
and he watched his beloved duck die.

2109
01:55:07,029 --> 01:55:08,455
你能閉嘴讓我把故事講完嗎?
Will you shut up and let me tell the story?

2110
01:55:08,483 --> 01:55:10,583
目前為止 我還不明白這個故事會怎麼個幽默法
So far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.

2111
01:55:10,686 --> 01:55:12,736
那夥計對於弄死那只鴨子感到很抱歉 
The guy feels so bad about killing the duck,

2112
01:55:12,737 --> 01:55:13,723
他給了他兩塊錢
 he gives him two dollars.

2113
01:55:13,758 --> 01:55:15,203
那孩子高興了嗎?
And the kid's happy with the two bucks?

2114
01:55:15,357 --> 01:55:17,320
他狂喜不止! 他上床了兩次 
He's ecstatic! He got laid twice, 

2115
01:55:17,321 --> 01:55:19,124
現在他又得到了兩塊錢
and now he's got two dollars on top of it.

2116
01:55:19,159 --> 01:55:21,781
聽上去一隻鴨子遠比兩塊錢有價值得多
Seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.

2117
01:55:22,531 --> 01:55:24,055
死了就不值錢了
This was a while back. You what I'm...

2118
01:55:24,466 --> 01:55:26,957
於是他到了家 他爸爸問 "發生什麼事了?"
So he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?

2119
01:55:27,035 --> 01:55:28,108
"告訴我! 告訴我!" 
"Tell me! Tell me!" 

2120
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,968
他說"爸爸 我用鴨子上了床"
He goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck,

2121
01:55:31,003 --> 01:55:32,163
"我又上床拿回了鴨子"
"I got a duck for the fuck,

2122
01:55:32,241 --> 01:55:34,784
"拿回了鴨子換來了兩塊錢!"
"and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!"

2123
01:55:37,079 --> 01:55:38,307
這像是打油詩
So it's like a limerick.

2124
01:55:39,514 --> 01:55:40,742
你覺得不好笑嗎?
You didn't think that was funny?

2125
01:55:41,216 --> 01:55:43,331
我覺得最後還是蠻娛樂大眾的 確實是
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure,

2126
01:55:43,785 --> 01:55:45,620
把所有的詞都串在一起
the way all the words were put together,

2127
01:55:45,621 --> 01:55:47,329
但是從內容上來說?
but in terms of content?

2128
01:55:48,824 --> 01:55:49,916
不好笑
No.

2129
01:55:53,128 --> 01:55:56,757
結完賬咱走人吧
Get the check-check from Shen-Shen. Let's get out of here.

2130
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:06,538
別這樣 你搞嘛啊
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

2131
01:56:06,642 --> 01:56:07,666
卡
And cut.

2132
01:56:09,999 --> 01:56:10,010
