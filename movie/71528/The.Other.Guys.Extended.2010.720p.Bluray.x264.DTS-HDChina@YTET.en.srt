1
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,919
<i>In New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.</i>

2
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,785
<i>On that line live Danson and Highsmith.</i>

3
00:00:58,027 --> 00:01:00,518
Tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!

4
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:04,900
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.

5
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,210
Get rid of that asshole.

6
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:24,253
<i>- Uh-oh! - I hate it when you say "uh-oh!"</i>

7
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:36,731
Dude, you put a ding in my hood!

8
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,828
Come on with it, then!

9
00:01:47,443 --> 00:01:49,240
Whoa, hey!

10
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,450
<i>That's trouble.</i>

11
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:15,593
Did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?

12
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,848
<i>That's it. I'm sick of all this running.</i>

13
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:36,850
Hang on!

14
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:53,242
You have the right to remain silent!

15
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,370
But I wanna hear you scream!

16
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,953
Down on the ground!

17
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:15,457
Detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!

18
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,191
One at a time, all right?

19
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:22,561
<i>Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson, New York Observer Online.</i>

20
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:25,606
These suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana,

21
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,107
a misdemeanor in some states.

22
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,441
Do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?

23
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,877
<i>Why don't we let New York City answer that question?</i>

24
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,441
The greatest city on Earth, yeah!

25
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,989
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.

26
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:46,653
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?

27
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,321
No comment.

28
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:50,163
But, yes.

29
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:55,226
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!

30
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:02,838
<i>No drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.</i>

31
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:08,640
<i>Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style. They're rock stars.</i>

32
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,743
<i>Then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets...</i>

33
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:14,755
<i>... and the other guys.</i>

34
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,686
We know, we know. We know.

35
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,958
All right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!

36
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:26,593
<i>We're having a celebration tonight at Butter.</i>

37
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,263
<i>Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.</i>

38
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:32,136
<i>- That little short bitch from Jersey Shore. - Yeah!</i>

39
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,302
And most of you are on the list.

40
00:04:35,378 --> 00:04:37,312
<i>You're the best.</i>

41
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,348
<i>Guys, I'm gonna say something right now.</i>

42
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,815
<i>It's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.</i>

43
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:44,717
- Arnold Schwarzenegger! - Let me finish.

44
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:47,187
He became a champion and then a movie star, all right?

45
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,451
- Arnold Schwarzenegger! - God damn it, let me...

46
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,459
They ruined the story. They ruined the story.

47
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:53,154
Let... What... The point is,

48
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:56,323
<i>we couldn't do our job if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork,</i>

49
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,697
<i>answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do.</i>

50
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,792
All the gun fights, all the car chases,

51
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,738
<i>all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to,</i>

52
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,504
all due to what you guys do. Thank you.

53
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:09,840
<i>And we'd do it again and again.</i>

54
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:12,210
Hey, you shut your face!

55
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,509
If we wanna hear you talk,

56
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,484
I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!

57
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,244
You hear me? You hear me?

58
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,721
- Cash bar. - Yeah.

59
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,654
Peace out, bitches.

60
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:26,995
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.

61
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:28,553
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

62
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,822
All right, right there.

63
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,868
Just back up, just like right there.

64
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,562
All right, just one... Just a...

65
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,400
There you go, right there. Right there.

66
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,066
<i>This is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.</i>

67
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:43,373
<i>That's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.</i>

68
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,109
<i>It's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.</i>

69
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,615
<i>- No offense, Bob. - That's all right.</i>

70
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,845
- Anyway, now who wants it? - I do!

71
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,582
All right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!

72
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:55,756
- Nice work. Thanks, Allen. - Thank you, Captain.

73
00:05:55,858 --> 00:05:57,120
<i>"I'll do it! I'll do it!"</i>

74
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,296
Stop humming that song!

75
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,131
- I can hum if I want to. - No, I know you can.

76
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,470
<i>I'm asking you to stop.</i>

77
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,802
<i>- Well, if you're asking, then I'll stop. - Thank you.</i>

78
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:23,910
Could you not smile like that?

79
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,820
<i>Now you're asking me to mask my emotions because of how it makes you feel.</i>

80
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:29,721
That I will not do.

81
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:36,396
Seriously, stop humming! Okay?

82
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,490
<i>This isn't accounting or wherever the hell</i>

83
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,934
you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.

84
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:44,973
<i>Forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.</i>

85
00:06:45,074 --> 00:06:49,135
Yeah, whatever. Stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.

86
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:51,110
Hey, guys. Reminder.

87
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,411
<i>The police union picnic's coming up this weekend.</i>

88
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:59,113
<i>My wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.</i>

89
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,587
<i>It's a bad time, Bob!</i>

90
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:03,685
All right.

91
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,352
Going to get a slice.

92
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,803
You know what I just did?

93
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:21,172
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives,

94
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:23,768
and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back,

95
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:26,041
but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me

96
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,776
<i>that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.</i>

97
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,045
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

98
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:31,949
<i>Good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.</i>

99
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:34,785
<i>- No. You don't have to. - No, I don't like you.</i>

100
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,290
<i>I think you're a fake cop.</i>

101
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:40,125
The sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.

102
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:42,960
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

103
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:47,731
<i>Even if you weren't in my food chain, I would go out of my way to attack you.</i>

104
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,395
If I were a lion, and you were a tuna,

105
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:52,099
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!

106
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,567
<i>And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.</i>

107
00:07:55,678 --> 00:08:00,012
Okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?

108
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:01,276
<i>Lions don't like water.</i>

109
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:05,414
<i>If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source, that'd make sense.</i>

110
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,053
But you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,

111
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,887
<i>I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa,</i>

112
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:15,526
coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna with his 20 or 30 friends?

113
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:16,758
You lose that battle.

114
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:19,767
You lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?

115
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:24,135
<i>You've wandered into our school of tuna, and we now have a taste of lion.</i>

116
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,640
<i>We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.</i>

117
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:27,902
<i>- Yeah? - And said, "You know what?</i>

118
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:31,140
<i>"Lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion."</i>

119
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,807
<i>We've developed a system to establish a beachhead</i>

120
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,817
and aggressively hunt you and your family.

121
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,080
And we will corner your pride,

122
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:41,055
- your children, your offspring. - How you gonna do that?

123
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:44,718
We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.

124
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:47,285
We will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.

125
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:51,833
<i>It's not gonna be days at a time, but an hour, hour 45, no problem.</i>

126
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,596
That will give us enough time to figure out where you live,

127
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,764
go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.

128
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,332
<i>You just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and outmanned.</i>

129
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:07,408
Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?

130
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,609
Nope.

131
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,784
Two minutes before the markets open,

132
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,125
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global, ringing the opening bell.

133
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,798
<i>With Boardman is investment banker, David Ershon,</i>

134
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:27,324
<i>who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.</i>

135
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:30,269
How much did we lose?

136
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:32,637
You may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.

137
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,801
- $32. - Million?

138
00:09:34,877 --> 00:09:37,107
No, billion.

139
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,648
Shit!

140
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:45,820
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.

141
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:47,683
- Bang, bang. - Yeah.

142
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,382
Then I raise up to take the leader out.

143
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:50,982
<i>Shit, I feel like I'm there now.</i>

144
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,255
<i>I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.</i>

145
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,660
<i>He says, "Let's even the odds!"</i>

146
00:09:55,965 --> 00:10:00,163
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.

147
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:02,727
Game over, bitches.

148
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:06,502
- All right. - Yeah.

149
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:12,106
<i>Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.</i>

150
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,171
Like my cock was made out of concrete.

151
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,418
<i>I know it's very tempting.</i>

152
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,581
You want to impress your friends.

153
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:22,246
<i>But this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?</i>

154
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:25,759
This is firing your weapon in the line of duty.

155
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:26,919
Officer Hoitz?

156
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:28,894
Oh, man.

157
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:30,124
- Come on! - Here we go.

158
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,598
Would you like to share?

159
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,826
<i>No, I'd rather not.</i>

160
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,569
<i>Officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now,</i>

161
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,434
<i>and you haven't said a word.</i>

162
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,872
This is a safe room, no judgment here.

163
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,034
Jerkoff.

164
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,408
<i>That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.</i>

165
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,005
I relive it every night.

166
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,282
<i>Bronx, October.</i>

167
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,181
<i>Game 7 of the World Series.</i>

168
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:53,517
For all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, and I pulled tunnel duty.

169
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:56,422
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.

170
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,425
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!

171
00:10:58,527 --> 00:10:59,858
<i>Finally pulled my gun.</i>

172
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,226
Pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.

173
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:03,197
<i>Don't make me shoot! I'll do it!</i>

174
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,298
<i>Are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?</i>

175
00:11:06,402 --> 00:11:09,530
<i>You dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!</i>

176
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,369
- You cost me 20 grand on that game! - Douche bag.

177
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,908
Cost the city a championship.

178
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,308
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.

179
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:19,275
<i>Now I'm stuck with a desk jockey partner. Everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.</i>

180
00:11:19,381 --> 00:11:21,042
Because you shot Derek Jeter!

181
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,413
<i>He's a biracial angel.</i>

182
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:24,145
<i>You should've shot A-Rod.</i>

183
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,125
Yo, Paper Bitch.

184
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:35,156
<i>- What's up, man? - Hey. Hey, guys.</i>

185
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:36,959
- Paper Bitch. - Paper Bitch.

186
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,124
<i>I don't like that, actually.</i>

187
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,997
<i>I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.</i>

188
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,660
Still working on the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?

189
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,829
<i>- Shit. - No, actually, actually, that's...</i>

190
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,304
What is this? That looks stupid.

191
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:49,002
<i>Guys, it's illegal permitting for construction. Specifically, scaffolding.</i>

192
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,635
Some of the guys were talking.

193
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:53,506
<i>They were like, "How come you've never fired your weapon in the office before?"</i>

194
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:54,310
Good point.

195
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,381
<i>I'm sorry, I don't follow.</i>

196
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:57,918
<i>You've never fired your weapon in the office.</i>

197
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,147
<i>We all have, you know. It's called a desk pop.</i>

198
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:02,918
<i>Fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.</i>

199
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,151
<i>- Not true. - I'm not stupid.</i>

200
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,694
<i>I'm not gonna discharge my firearm in the office.</i>

201
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:08,354
<i>Gamble, listen to me. I'll try to make it real clear.</i>

202
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:12,594
<i>We honor the flag, and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.</i>

203
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,760
<i>Jimmy. When's the last time you had a desk pop?</i>

204
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:16,497
<i>September '08.</i>

205
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,935
- Be a man. Do it. - Now.

206
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,702
- Please, please, do it. - Pop one off!

207
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:22,869
<i>- There you go. Pop it off! - Don't think, just go!</i>

208
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,503
- Here we go. - Do it, yes.

209
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,173
He did it!

210
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,114
Hey! Shots fired!

211
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:32,346
Hey, Terry, I did it! I did my first desk pop!

212
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,413
<i>It's a real thing, right?</i>

213
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,013
- A desk pop? - Yeah.

214
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,217
<i>No, that's not real!</i>

215
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:41,252
They were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.

216
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,097
<i>All right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.</i>

217
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:47,293
Yes, sir.

218
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:51,396
Captain, you really wanna disarm this guy, take out the batteries in the calculator.

219
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:54,874
<i>All right, I'm gonna give you this. This is a dummy gun. I use it for ceremony.</i>

220
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:56,104
There.

221
00:12:57,446 --> 00:13:01,041
You get this back when I feel you know how to handle it.

222
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,313
<i>Listen, guys. I'm working two jobs. I'm working here.</i>

223
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:08,584
And I got another job at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?

224
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,285
<i>I'm doing that just to put a kid through NYU</i>

225
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,126
so he can explore his bisexuality and become a deejay.

226
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:18,655
Now the last thing I need is a ballistics report in the unit.

227
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:21,133
<i>I'm just gonna ask you guys, please, come on, really.</i>

228
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,966
Just think about... Just be smart.

229
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,968
<i>211 in progress.</i>

230
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:57,130
<i>They're using a wrecking ball to clean out Castien Jewelry.</i>

231
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,639
All right, we got it.

232
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,039
<i>- Good luck, guys. Have a good one. - Allen, let's go.</i>

233
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:04,010
- No, I got work to do. - What? This is work!

234
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,674
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith. We roll in heavy.

235
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,081
You cream puffs, sit tight.

236
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:10,515
You gotta be shitting me!

237
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,682
<i>You can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?</i>

238
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:16,850
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!

239
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,227
Did he just... Did he just call himself a peacock?

240
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,999
<i>Let's go! Let's go!</i>

241
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,100
Come on, fellas!

242
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,743
Wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!

243
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:52,219
<i>That's the second one this week!</i>

244
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,587
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!

245
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:57,391
<i>Let's go!</i>

246
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,291
Yeah!

247
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,062
Heads up!

248
00:15:01,403 --> 00:15:02,529
Shit.

249
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:17,710
Special Forces zipline.

250
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,083
<i>Cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!</i>

251
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,587
<i>- These guys are pros. - Let's go!</i>

252
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,058
<i>You thinking what I'm thinking, partner?</i>

253
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:26,753
Aim for the bushes.

254
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:58,019
<i>Cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.</i>

255
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:02,086
<i>Maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.</i>

256
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:04,325
<i>Maybe their egos pushed them off.</i>

257
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,129
<i>I don't know. But that shit was crazy.</i>

258
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:11,935
<i>Either way, there was a hole in New York City, and it needed to be filled.</i>

259
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:14,305
<i>Two days ago, this city wept.</i>

260
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:18,335
<i>We lost two heroes who gave everything for us,</i>

261
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:23,350
<i>who paid that ultimate sacrifice so that we may walk these streets safely.</i>

262
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:25,844
<i>There wasn't even an awning in their direction.</i>

263
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:28,115
- No, I know. - They just jumped 20 stories.

264
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,521
<i>Doesn't make sense, does it?</i>

265
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:33,493
<i>I only hope God lets them take their.357s with them to heaven.</i>

266
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:36,895
<i>It's our moment, Allen. Our moment to step up and be the guys.</i>

267
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,061
<i>- We're at a funeral. Show some respect. - What?</i>

268
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:43,395
<i>You don't think every other detective here isn't thinking the same thing?</i>

269
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,301
Allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.

270
00:16:48,377 --> 00:16:51,369
Their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.

271
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,007
<i>That someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.</i>

272
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,840
- Is it? - Yeah.

273
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,548
What about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens,

274
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,385
all just stepping up and doing their part?

275
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,721
<i>As a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?</i>

276
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,987
<i>I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.</i>

277
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:09,394
I went to school and made my bed.

278
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:12,092
And at age 11, I audited my parents.

279
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,500
And believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.

280
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,436
What the hell are you?

281
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,508
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

282
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:24,672
Look at these two jamokes, would you? One shot Jeter and the other shot an office.

283
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,680
<i>Have some decorum. We're at a funeral.</i>

284
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,947
You wanna dance, brolio?

285
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:37,287
<i>I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks. You'll be pissing blood out of your ass.</i>

286
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:38,450
<i>That's horrible.</i>

287
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,720
<i>Why don't you step back, man?</i>

288
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,262
You touch him, I swear to God

289
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:43,194
<i>I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.</i>

290
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:45,790
<i>He's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.</i>

291
00:17:45,901 --> 00:17:47,698
- You wanna go? - I wanna go!

292
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:50,469
- Get him off. - Kick his ass, Martin.

293
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,300
Yeah. How do you like that?

294
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,233
- Pull his hair! - I love it.

295
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,105
This hurts so good.

296
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,207
<i>- Very sorry for your loss, ma'am. - What a lovely hat.</i>

297
00:18:00,282 --> 00:18:01,840
I love your shoes.

298
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:03,941
<i>- It's fine, it's fine. - Go, go.</i>

299
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:05,712
Punish him!

300
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:07,812
Oh, man.

301
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,458
<i>Do it. That's how we do it in the hood.</i>

302
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,753
<i>- Punish him. - That's not even a move.</i>

303
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:15,293
<i>I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.</i>

304
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,365
What the hell is going on here?

305
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,491
Two good men are dead,

306
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:22,662
<i>and you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?</i>

307
00:18:22,738 --> 00:18:23,864
<i>Is that what's happening?</i>

308
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,496
<i>Yes, that's exactly what's happening.</i>

309
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,232
Let me tell you something.

310
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,241
- Sorry for your loss, Lorraine. - Very sorry.

311
00:18:30,746 --> 00:18:32,646
- Sorry, Lorraine. - Sorry, Lorraine.

312
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:34,478
<i>Hi, I'm Jimmy.</i>

313
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:37,345
<i>- Too soon? - Why'd you say that?</i>

314
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,511
<i>I'll tell you something about those guys.</i>

315
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:44,184
They knew that to become a good cop, you had to solve cases. Okay?

316
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:48,258
Okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.

317
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,927
Okay? So just watch it.

318
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,101
Next time, me, you, library.

319
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,329
- Not even close. - Come on, guys. Guys, come on.

320
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,006
<i>- You are... - I'm the winner!</i>

321
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:02,339
<i>I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay? I could've handled that myself.</i>

322
00:19:02,411 --> 00:19:06,108
<i>Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.</i>

323
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:07,442
Move.

324
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,621
<i>- 9:15, let's have a great day, everybody! - Cut the shit!</i>

325
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:27,829
Good morning.

326
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:32,003
<i>We've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.</i>

327
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:34,008
<i>There are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.</i>

328
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:35,202
<i>Try to stay out of trouble, boys.</i>

329
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,971
<i>There's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?</i>

330
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,876
No chance. Too busy.

331
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:43,516
<i>All right, ladies. Starting to get the picture? We're about to lock shit down.</i>

332
00:19:43,585 --> 00:19:45,576
<i>- That's right. - You girls stay here and get your type on.</i>

333
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:47,587
Go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.

334
00:19:47,723 --> 00:19:48,815
Shut up!

335
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,154
Allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?

336
00:19:51,226 --> 00:19:52,693
<i>I... I'm super busy right now, Terry.</i>

337
00:19:52,761 --> 00:19:54,661
<i>No, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.</i>

338
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,595
<i>It's about the construction permits you were talking about.</i>

339
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,689
- The scaffolding violations? - This is our thing, yeah.

340
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:01,893
So, what do you got?

341
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:04,494
<i>I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.</i>

342
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:05,665
What are you doing?

343
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:08,437
<i>Let's go. We're going to that call.</i>

344
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,101
- What is this? - Shut up.

345
00:20:10,212 --> 00:20:12,544
<i>We're going to the car, and we're going after this case.</i>

346
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:14,047
<i>- You're not gonna shoot me. - I won't?</i>

347
00:20:14,116 --> 00:20:15,583
- No. - I shot Jeter.

348
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,845
- That was an accident. - Was it?

349
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,443
- Now move. - Okay.

350
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,519
Hey.

351
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,787
<i>Does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.</i>

352
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,690
<i>I'm being kidnapped.</i>

353
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,856
<i>Really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?</i>

354
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,465
- So, then what happened? - What do you think happened?

355
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,934
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, and I got in my car, and I got out of there.

356
00:20:36,037 --> 00:20:37,561
Talk about a wild weekend, right?

357
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:40,938
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.

358
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,203
What are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.

359
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,445
What the hell is this?

360
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,245
<i>It's my car. It's a Prius.</i>

361
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:53,981
<i>I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.</i>

362
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,922
Detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.

363
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:59,085
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.

364
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:00,890
<i>We'll just see who's there first.</i>

365
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:03,658
You stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?

366
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,390
Go, go, go!

367
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,497
You feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?

368
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,468
Big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?

369
00:21:10,572 --> 00:21:12,164
<i>Are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?</i>

370
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:14,299
I got something to get you going.

371
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:19,306
<i>Let's go do some damage!</i>

372
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:21,977
Nope.

373
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,479
What the hell is that?

374
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:27,948
LRB. Little River Band.

375
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:30,622
<i>This music makes me feel like I'm going shopping for a training bra.</i>

376
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,427
You know what? We go with no music, okay?

377
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:34,621
- Fine. - Say bye.

378
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:35,822
<i>No, no, no, don't say bye...</i>

379
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:37,626
You just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!

380
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:40,930
Allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!

381
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,435
America!

382
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:45,035
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!

383
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,805
<i>Seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!</i>

384
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:49,969
<i>Terry, I'm coming in.</i>

385
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:51,876
<i>You're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!</i>

386
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,647
Dude! What...

387
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:00,981
<i>That's a lot of cocaine.</i>

388
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:04,949
<i>Did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?</i>

389
00:22:05,026 --> 00:22:06,823
Nope. No. No.

390
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,861
<i>I've never actually put my foot all the way down</i>

391
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:13,862
to the ground with the accelerator like that.

392
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:17,334
It got me slightly aroused.

393
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,467
Here we go.

394
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:27,003
Way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.

395
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,516
- Prius, huh? - Yep, yep.

396
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,846
Good mileage?

397
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,318
- Outstanding. - Yeah.

398
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,981
Did this come with a dental dam?

399
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,590
- No. - Get it?

400
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:41,062
My Suburban shit one of these last night.

401
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:42,754
<i>I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.</i>

402
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,526
<i>We've had our fun, huh?</i>

403
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,569
Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.

404
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:50,429
All right, everybody!

405
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,565
<i>I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.</i>

406
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:56,075
<i>"At the crime scene, LOL."</i>

407
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:57,872
- Good tweet, good tweet. - Yeah, thanks.

408
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:02,012
<i>America has always been defined by its excess.</i>

409
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,686
<i>The Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.</i>

410
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,188
<i>Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.</i>

411
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:12,124
<i>I myself have 18 Lamborghinis</i>

412
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:15,229
<i>and a Subaru station wagon.</i>

413
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:18,431
<i>And it's because of this excess that I have flourished.</i>

414
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:22,128
<i>I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.</i>

415
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:25,934
<i>Live for excess. It's the American way.</i>

416
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,777
Hello.

417
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:37,645
<i>Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.</i>

418
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,215
Sir David.

419
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,919
<i>David. You're not returning my calls, so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.</i>

420
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,621
<i>- G'day, mate. - Hey.</i>

421
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:50,327
<i>Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you,</i>

422
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:51,694
<i>because I think you're going to take off.</i>

423
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:55,265
<i>Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.</i>

424
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:57,771
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.

425
00:23:57,839 --> 00:24:00,672
<i>You have until then to give me my money. I'm not reporting any losses, David.</i>

426
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:02,606
I have zeroed in on a new investor.

427
00:24:02,677 --> 00:24:05,703
<i>Well, then, you get their money, make it disappear, and then pay us back.</i>

428
00:24:05,814 --> 00:24:09,113
<i>Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.</i>

429
00:24:09,184 --> 00:24:11,675
- David! - Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.

430
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:16,155
<i>Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.</i>

431
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,683
Heard everything, mate.

432
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,051
Ladies and gentlemen,

433
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,654
guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.

434
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,034
That man there.

435
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,827
Go! Go!

436
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:31,969
- Side! - Step aside, please.

437
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:34,504
<i>You don't think I'm a real cop, do you?</i>

438
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:36,840
<i>No, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.</i>

439
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,037
I was really honest about that.

440
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,637
<i>I'm working on a huge case, all right?</i>

441
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:42,842
Property owner with seven buildings under construction.

442
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:46,045
<i>He hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.</i>

443
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:50,090
Now, according to Ask Jeeves, this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.

444
00:24:50,191 --> 00:24:53,888
<i>- That's your big case? Scaffolding permits? - Yeah.</i>

445
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:57,225
<i>Guess what? You're coming with me.</i>

446
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,899
<i>It's a wooden gun.</i>

447
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,235
That hurts, man!

448
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:10,376
<i>I've always got Little River Band loaded up here. I've got six disks in here.</i>

449
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:14,375
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.

450
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:16,917
<i>I'm flying Air Singapore.</i>

451
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,713
<i>- Hey, Douglas. How's the wife? - She died.</i>

452
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:19,879
Attaboy!

453
00:25:19,954 --> 00:25:21,922
<i>I'll be there in two minutes exactly.</i>

454
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,685
Another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.

455
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,058
<i>You're just mad because I have a nice change purse.</i>

456
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:29,255
Why do you even care?

457
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:32,299
<i>How can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?</i>

458
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,425
<i>The way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.</i>

459
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:35,628
<i>You're being ridiculous.</i>

460
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:38,297
They sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.

461
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,703
- What? - Like a little...

462
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:41,639
- You know what bugs me about you? - What?

463
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:43,074
<i>I'm pretty sure you've never voted.</i>

464
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:46,477
<i>No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.</i>

465
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,913
<i>You're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.</i>

466
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:50,075
Get out of the way, man!

467
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:52,051
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

468
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,418
<i>Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...</i>

469
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,755
<i>Anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.</i>

470
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:02,092
<i>- Excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay? - What?</i>

471
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:07,100
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used...

472
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,295
<i>- What's the next part? - As a floatation device.</i>

473
00:26:09,404 --> 00:26:10,894
As a floatation device.

474
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:14,499
<i>You know what? That's very funny. I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.</i>

475
00:26:14,609 --> 00:26:16,406
- Really? - Are you guys for real?

476
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:17,570
<i>Am I being punk'd?</i>

477
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:20,010
Detective Allen Gamble.

478
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:23,016
We are in a cocaine-covered car, and we are bringing in a perp.

479
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:25,916
- One David Ershon. - 175 pounds.

480
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:28,012
- Thank you. 175 pounds. - Shut up, man, shut up!

481
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:32,022
<i>Martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B talking to Shepard Smith right now.</i>

482
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,960
We arrest this jerkoff for a scaffolding permit?

483
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,259
Wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?

484
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:39,197
For scaffolding permit violation...

485
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,109
- I got my insurance card. Somewhere. - Easy, mate.

486
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:52,544
- What the hell? You ran right into us! - Stand over there.

487
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,172
Wood?

488
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:55,842
What the...

489
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,713
<i>- Couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate. - What?</i>

490
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,446
Do not let these men take me.

491
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,314
Hi.

492
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,948
<i>Why's she looking at you like that?</i>

493
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,516
<i>That's my car!</i>

494
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:10,359
<i>Hey, hey, hey! We didn't exchange insurance information!</i>

495
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:12,290
Hey! Excuse me!

496
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,568
Why did they take our shoes?

497
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,071
<i>- What the hell just happened? - Where's my iPhone?</i>

498
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,368
<i>I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.</i>

499
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:27,505
<i>I don't get why we can't just call the office and have a squad car come pick us up.</i>

500
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:30,073
No. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.

501
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:31,812
<i>There's no way that's going out on the radio.</i>

502
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:35,315
<i>Look, if we're gonna do this together, there's some issues we need to settle, okay?</i>

503
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,985
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.

504
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,254
How do you think that makes me feel?

505
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:45,424
<i>I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.</i>

506
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,763
I hear you.

507
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:52,602
<i>Let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.</i>

508
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:55,335
All right. Fresh start.

509
00:27:57,045 --> 00:28:00,606
Maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers,

510
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,273
<i>'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.</i>

511
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:04,910
Right?

512
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:08,087
<i>Let's do another fresh start, 'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.</i>

513
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,951
Fine, fresh start.

514
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,856
<i>It's the last one.</i>

515
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:14,861
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.

516
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,563
- Okay, folks! Everybody, listen up! - Listen up!

517
00:28:20,635 --> 00:28:22,569
Got a high profile kidnapping.

518
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,103
David Ershon, wealthy banker, multinational team.

519
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,232
<i>Maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.</i>

520
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:32,746
<i>Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.</i>

521
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:34,805
<i>Who cares? It's not important, okay?</i>

522
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,441
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

523
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,048
- Bye, guys. - Bye-bye.

524
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:42,214
Come on.

525
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:45,820
Guys, this is Don Beaman, the attorney for Mr. Ershon.

526
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:48,054
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

527
00:28:48,129 --> 00:28:50,063
- Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch! - Hey, hey, hey!

528
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,894
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!

529
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:53,934
<i>- That's the guy who took our guns, Captain. - And my shoes!</i>

530
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:57,062
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Did you identify yourselves as police officers?

531
00:28:57,138 --> 00:28:58,230
What is this?

532
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,638
- Allen, tell me. Did you? - No, we did not.

533
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:04,735
Sorry, gentlemen. We thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.

534
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,440
<i>It's only protocol.</i>

535
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:11,278
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation. The case is closed.

536
00:29:11,352 --> 00:29:13,843
<i>I've taken care of all necessary paperwork.</i>

537
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,048
And you fellas, at this point, should just be glad that

538
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:19,649
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.

539
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:21,194
- Thank you, Captain. - You bet.

540
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,321
Australian?

541
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:24,831
Special Forces, right?

542
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,724
Best watch your step, Detective.

543
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,531
There are three things I love in this world.

544
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:31,696
Kylie Minogue,

545
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:36,072
<i>small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...</i>

546
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:37,542
Beautiful features.

547
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:40,375
<i>...and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.</i>

548
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:45,009
Hey! Shake your dicks. This pissing contest is over.

549
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:46,417
Come on, man.

550
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,084
All right, look, they returned your shoes.

551
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:56,759
And they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.

552
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:01,062
Allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it,

553
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,002
some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.

554
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:06,666
You might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.

555
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:07,867
Okay.

556
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:09,068
<i>You're mad at us, huh, Gene?</i>

557
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:12,874
<i>First off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.</i>

558
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:15,541
<i>Guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?</i>

559
00:30:15,616 --> 00:30:16,742
- Sure. - All right.

560
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,445
<i>Well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?</i>

561
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,352
The opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.

562
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,391
<i>It's just "Captain."</i>

563
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:27,519
<i>Just "Captain." It's not "Captain Gene." I don't have a kiddie show.</i>

564
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:29,222
<i>That sounds creepy, "Captain Gene."</i>

565
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,691
<i>Police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.</i>

566
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:36,703
<i>Was he the victim of financial profiling?</i>

567
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:41,470
<i>Financial profiling? That's crazy. He broke the law and we arrested him.</i>

568
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:45,637
<i>That wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me."</i>

569
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:48,147
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.

570
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,247
What about donkeys or deer?

571
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,287
They have hooves. What about bovine creatures?

572
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,416
<i>Were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?</i>

573
00:30:57,492 --> 00:31:00,461
- Yeah. - Yeah. I could see it.

574
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:02,620
<i>Listen, why don't we just go over to my place?</i>

575
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,061
<i>We'll talk the case down.</i>

576
00:31:04,132 --> 00:31:06,157
We can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.

577
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:08,963
Two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?

578
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,230
<i>- It's not dinner. - Fine.</i>

579
00:31:10,304 --> 00:31:12,101
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

580
00:31:12,173 --> 00:31:14,573
in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.

581
00:31:14,642 --> 00:31:19,841
<i>She's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.</i>

582
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:25,851
Okay, so I put together a little bio, complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

583
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:29,354
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.

584
00:31:29,457 --> 00:31:33,018
<i>I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.</i>

585
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:36,358
<i>David Ershon is currently the CEO of Ershon Consortium.</i>

586
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:37,522
<i>Who's that talking?</i>

587
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,157
<i>It's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.</i>

588
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:44,261
<i>Ershon Consortium, current financial investments exceed $70 billion.</i>

589
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:47,364
<i>His largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.</i>

590
00:31:47,475 --> 00:31:50,171
<i>Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.</i>

591
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:53,338
<i>Yeah, oil, media, health care, you've probably heard their jingle.</i>

592
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:56,383
<i>Lendl Global, we're in everything</i>

593
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:59,317
<i>David Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...</i>

594
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:01,719
<i>- Yeah. ...and the lead singer of Maroon 5.</i>

595
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,654
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels,

596
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:06,557
black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.

597
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:08,288
How do you get that from anything I just said?

598
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:10,159
<i>Hey, guys! Soup's on.</i>

599
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,630
What do you mean?

600
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:14,826
Hi.

601
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,494
- Hi. - You must be Terry.

602
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,802
<i>I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.</i>

603
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:23,905
<i>- Who are you? - I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.</i>

604
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:26,840
- Come on, seriously. Who is that? - His old lady.

605
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:29,405
<i>- Sweetie, it's a workstation. - Got it.</i>

606
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:33,044
<i>And you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.</i>

607
00:32:33,154 --> 00:32:35,088
<i>I know you're working. I'm so sorry.</i>

608
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,180
- Come on, seriously. - Come on, what?

609
00:32:37,258 --> 00:32:38,486
Who is that?

610
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,584
<i>That's the old... That's the old ball and chain.</i>

611
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,488
Get over here.

612
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,192
- Not... Not right now. - Okay.

613
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,258
<i>Look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?</i>

614
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,068
Come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?

615
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:54,430
<i>- Are you really Allen's wife? - I know.</i>

616
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:58,000
<i>People are shocked because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic,</i>

617
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,112
but somehow it works.

618
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,408
- Are you gonna change? - I already did.

619
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,745
<i>It's no big deal. You look really, really nice.</i>

620
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:09,914
<i>Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.</i>

621
00:33:10,024 --> 00:33:11,355
<i>Don't speak to her like that, Allen.</i>

622
00:33:11,425 --> 00:33:15,691
<i>Look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, you'd probably get a D-.</i>

623
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:18,061
Allen and his apps. He loves them.

624
00:33:18,132 --> 00:33:21,590
<i>You know he's designed three of his own? One of them... Can I tell him?</i>

625
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,136
<i>One of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face,</i>

626
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:27,036
<i>and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.</i>

627
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,606
- Faceback. - Faceback.

628
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:30,734
Got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.

629
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:32,272
<i>- It's gonna hit. - It's gonna catch.</i>

630
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,405
Why are you with Allen?

631
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:38,384
<i>I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?</i>

632
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:40,920
<i>It's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.</i>

633
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:42,683
<i>You're gonna be bored by it.</i>

634
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:46,750
I was a dancer for the Knicks while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.

635
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:49,091
Allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.

636
00:33:49,197 --> 00:33:50,255
Yes.

637
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,992
Needless to say, I fell for him immediately.

638
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:57,633
We immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn,

639
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,704
<i>- and, to be honest, we didn't speak. - Three days</i>

640
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:03,335
of not communicating once verbally.

641
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:05,703
We had actually, without knowing it,

642
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,047
developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.

643
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,947
You know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.

644
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:19,382
After those three days of non-verbal communication and a whole lot of loving,

645
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:22,926
I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.

646
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:26,960
Similar to operating on a German shepherd

647
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:31,263
- when they have hip dysplasia. - Very painful.

648
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:35,633
<i>It's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie, always forget the name of it.</i>

649
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:36,903
- With Meg Ryan. - Yes.

650
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:39,947
<i>I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.</i>

651
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:42,447
<i>- I'll think of it. I'll think of it. - Okay.</i>

652
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,245
So, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?

653
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:46,309
I did, yeah.

654
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,888
<i>We were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.</i>

655
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:51,424
- Terry shot Derek Jeter. - Shut up, Allen. This was before.

656
00:34:51,492 --> 00:34:52,754
<i>That's okay.</i>

657
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:54,795
<i>She's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.</i>

658
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,829
<i>That's it! Honey!</i>

659
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:57,989
- With Tom Hanks? - Right.

660
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,157
- And Meg Ryan. - Meg Ryan.

661
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:00,325
<i>He didn't have poison ivy up his ass.</i>

662
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,731
- Yes, he did. - Yes, he did. Yeah.

663
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,064
Way up there.

664
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:06,165
<i>Well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...</i>

665
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:07,901
What a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.

666
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:11,604
- It was so, so nice meeting you, Terry. - It was my pleasure. Thank you.

667
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,173
<i>And remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.</i>

668
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,650
- She tells me that every day before I leave. - Yep, I do.

669
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,819
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries,

670
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:24,686
<i>and I say, "Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today,</i>

671
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,089
<i>"you just don't get hurt."</i>

672
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,491
Yeah. Every morning.

673
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:31,420
<i>And then I show him my breasts, and I say, "These are waiting for you</i>

674
00:35:31,499 --> 00:35:32,625
<i>- "when you get back home." - Right.</i>

675
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,601
<i>You know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen,</i>

676
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,104
- but, man, are they perky. - Not by a long shot.

677
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:40,834
<i>- And they are firm, and they are yours. - You're a nice lady.</i>

678
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:43,837
Thank you for coming.

679
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:48,170
<i>Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.</i>

680
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:49,340
Go for Hoitz.

681
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,974
<i>- We found your red Prius. - Great.</i>

682
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,145
<i>It was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.</i>

683
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,450
- Come on. - Okay, sugar balls, listen up.

684
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:56,820
<i>There's gonna be fingerprints on that car.</i>

685
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:59,223
<i>Tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.</i>

686
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:02,990
<i>And if we get a hit, this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.</i>

687
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,396
You do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.

688
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,557
- Okay. - Thank you, Sheila.

689
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,725
<i>He'll bring it.</i>

690
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,462
- Good night! - Good night.

691
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:10,868
Thank you, Sheila.

692
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:14,231
<i>- Bye, Terry! - Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.</i>

693
00:36:14,342 --> 00:36:16,139
- Bye, Terry! - All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.

694
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,302
Bye, Sheila!

695
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:18,868
- Night! - See you... See you, Terry!

696
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:20,837
Bye, Sheila.

697
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,413
<i>I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!</i>

698
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,079
Bye, Sheila!

699
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:36,929
Well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.

700
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,692
You find anything?

701
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,530
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

702
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,570
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

703
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:46,697
we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes had an orgy in the car.

704
00:36:46,774 --> 00:36:49,038
- Oh, God. - Yeah.

705
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,941
<i>You know what that's called when they do that in there?</i>

706
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,512
<i>That's called a soup kitchen.</i>

707
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,172
<i>It's pretty rough stuff.</i>

708
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:57,740
Not long after that, a mama raccoon came along

709
00:36:57,852 --> 00:36:59,251
and gave birth on the floor.

710
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:01,679
Placenta blew out all over the back window there.

711
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:05,451
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along

712
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,820
<i>takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.</i>

713
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:10,892
I think he knew you guys were cops,

714
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:13,766
because this is what I would call a spite shit.

715
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:15,668
You were able to determine all of that

716
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,567
- from the hair and fluid samples? - Oh, yeah.

717
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:19,837
What about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?

718
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:21,932
<i>- Nope, couldn't get a one. - Found a cell phone.</i>

719
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,604
<i>Yeah, that's mine.</i>

720
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,177
Any signs of a struggle or spent shells?

721
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:29,978
No. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.

722
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,143
In fact, they even left you a note here.

723
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:35,916
<i>"Thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys."</i>

724
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:37,080
<i>Here's something we found.</i>

725
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:39,752
We found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.

726
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,987
No fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.

727
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:46,497
<i>Yeah, it's a real shame, you know. I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.</i>

728
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:50,303
<i>It's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.</i>

729
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,134
Found a deer vagina.

730
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,202
- What? - Thought it was human lips at first.

731
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:57,777
Then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.

732
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:00,978
Not even a free ticket.

733
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:03,444
What are we gonna do?

734
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:06,611
We got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.

735
00:38:06,854 --> 00:38:09,322
<i>Look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.</i>

736
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,858
- They used your phone? - They ghost dialed.

737
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:13,086
Someone probably sat on it.

738
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:15,924
It could have recorded some of their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.

739
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,361
We gotta hear the other side of that call.

740
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:19,897
<i>Nope, no, it's nothing.</i>

741
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:22,231
<i>- Nothing? It's the only lead we have. - It's nothing. It's nothing.</i>

742
00:38:22,303 --> 00:38:23,702
Why did you just get super jumpy?

743
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,897
What?

744
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,941
<i>It's an ex-girlfriend, okay?</i>

745
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,771
<i>What's the matter? What happened with you guys?</i>

746
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,708
<i>She was just a bit of a handful, that's it.</i>

747
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,651
<i>Allen, it's the only lead we have.</i>

748
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:41,084
We either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.

749
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:43,555
<i>Fine. Let's go see her.</i>

750
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,732
Hello, Christinith.

751
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,397
Hello, Allen.

752
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,573
<i>- That's my partner, Terry. - Hi, Telly.</i>

753
00:39:05,012 --> 00:39:08,175
- Holy shit. Dude. - Just relax, relax.

754
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:13,352
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.

755
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:16,256
That was 13 years ago.

756
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:24,263
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert. Who wants some Arnie Palmies?

757
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,191
Sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.

758
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:30,464
- Hal, just place it down, please. - All righty.

759
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:32,533
Okay.

760
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:41,808
<i>I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.</i>

761
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,179
No.

762
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:46,048
<i>- Christinith, your husband, it's awkward. - Oh, no, he knows all of this.</i>

763
00:39:46,153 --> 00:39:48,644
<i>- You're a lucky dog. - It's true.</i>

764
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:53,557
Christine, this is a lovely house.

765
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:56,687
<i>It's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?</i>

766
00:39:56,897 --> 00:39:59,491
Christinith, you idiot!

767
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:04,202
<i>You come to our house, you get my wife's name right!</i>

768
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,003
- What? - Christinith!

769
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,837
Look, we really appreciate the hospitality.

770
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:11,337
<i>We'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.</i>

771
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:15,371
We believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.

772
00:40:18,185 --> 00:40:21,956
<i>Okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it</i>

773
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:24,481
and everyone else stay here.

774
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:27,520
- Okay, sweetie. - Come on.

775
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:33,764
<i>- There's my phone. - Great, thank you for...</i>

776
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:40,607
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

777
00:40:40,674 --> 00:40:44,075
<i>- You're so strong. - I'm stronger than you will ever know!</i>

778
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:47,170
I hate you! I hate you!

779
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:50,773
<i>You're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.</i>

780
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:54,787
<i>You go, "I wuv you." Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith."</i>

781
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:05,031
<i>You probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.</i>

782
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:07,100
<i>But I'm not.</i>

783
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:09,969
Shaved.

784
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:12,200
<i>- Allen! - He's fine.</i>

785
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,367
Question.

786
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:16,569
What would you rather be,

787
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:20,413
a bear or a dog?

788
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:23,516
<i>- I don't care. - I wanna be</i>

789
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:27,445
a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

790
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,488
<i>'Cause that way, I could live in the house</i>

791
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:33,727
but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.

792
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:35,756
Allen!

793
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,524
Allen! Allen!

794
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:44,833
<i>- This is police evidence. Terry! Let's go! - Hey!</i>

795
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:47,430
You get back here and you make love to my wife!

796
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,065
Allen! Allen!

797
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,437
<i>I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.</i>

798
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:55,777
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.

799
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,510
Your wife is crazy hot.

800
00:41:57,584 --> 00:42:00,280
<i>I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, she threw you a "Do me" vibe.</i>

801
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,321
What is it with you and hot ladies?

802
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:05,756
<i>First off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.</i>

803
00:42:05,859 --> 00:42:09,920
<i>Dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.</i>

804
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,396
- You wanna listen to this message or not? - Yeah, whatever.

805
00:42:12,499 --> 00:42:13,466
<i>You have one job, mate.</i>

806
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,159
<i>Find a sucker to invest with you</i>

807
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:18,204
<i>so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.</i>

808
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:19,500
<i>And I don't care who.</i>

809
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:21,905
<i>Right. I actually think I found a sucker...</i>

810
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,443
<i>- He's talking to Ershon. ...to invest $32 billion.</i>

811
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:26,103
<i>Who's got $32 billion to rob?</i>

812
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:28,443
<i>Once I get the money, I'll falsify the records</i>

813
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:31,346
<i>to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.</i>

814
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:35,081
<i>Now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,</i>

815
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:36,747
<i>and after that...</i>

816
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,620
<i>I told you it wasn't a security team.</i>

817
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:42,089
- He was being abducted. - Obviously, but what kind... Holy...

818
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:43,720
Nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!

819
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:44,957
- Is that him? - Yeah!

820
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,862
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!

821
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,765
- Holy shit! - They chased us 20 miles.

822
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,064
- You come back here! You get back here! - Allen!

823
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:02,407
<i>2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.</i>

824
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,245
Holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.

825
00:43:05,619 --> 00:43:08,053
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.

826
00:43:08,122 --> 00:43:10,955
<i>$32 billion. That's the state's money.</i>

827
00:43:11,058 --> 00:43:13,253
Well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.

828
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:16,819
<i>We have a scratchy cell phone message and an address. It's still half a case.</i>

829
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:20,889
<i>There's gotta be some sort of paper trail. If we can find that, if we can track it,</i>

830
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:22,162
then we can go to Mauch.

831
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:26,929
<i>So, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm,</i>

832
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,736
and I found some pretty interesting stuff.

833
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,972
It turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...

834
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:35,108
<i>Hold on, I'm up.</i>

835
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:39,476
<i>I gave my love to Erin</i>

836
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:44,117
<i>She promised to be true</i>

837
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:48,651
<i>I went to war to come back</i>

838
00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:52,698
<i>And find five British soldiers</i>

839
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,997
<i>Had their way with her</i>

840
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,539
<i>It was consensual</i>

841
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:02,333
Done?

842
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:05,377
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

843
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:08,539
has only one client, David Ershon.

844
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,174
Pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.

845
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,981
<i>Looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.</i>

846
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,818
<i>That's a shitty day.</i>

847
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:22,119
<i>And all their fathers were hanged</i>

848
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:25,654
<i>And the children all got pink eye</i>

849
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:34,572
<i>While their Harry Potter books were burned</i>

850
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:42,648
<i>Do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.</i>

851
00:44:42,716 --> 00:44:45,150
<i>I do. They're full of rich history.</i>

852
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,344
<i>Damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.</i>

853
00:44:48,422 --> 00:44:50,822
I thought you said you guys split up.

854
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:53,416
<i>Let's just keep our thing about work, okay?</i>

855
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,085
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

856
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:57,186
Hey, get off me, man.

857
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:18,512
What the hell are you doing?

858
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:21,179
<i>I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?</i>

859
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:23,416
I love you, Francine.

860
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:26,754
<i>If you were with me, you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!</i>

861
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:31,888
This is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.

862
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:34,024
He loves you very much, Francine.

863
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:36,569
- Who is this guy? - What are you doing here, Allen?

864
00:45:36,637 --> 00:45:38,264
<i>It's the code. I'm your partner.</i>

865
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:41,532
<i>I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.</i>

866
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,098
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

867
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,077
<i>Who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.</i>

868
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:49,582
He is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?

869
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,447
I know that this is a big surprise,

870
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:54,384
but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?

871
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:57,922
<i>Now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.</i>

872
00:45:57,991 --> 00:45:59,788
<i>What, you don't think I can do this shit?</i>

873
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,505
That was surprisingly good, Terry.

874
00:46:18,812 --> 00:46:21,508
<i>- I love you, Francine. - You don't know what love is.</i>

875
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:23,549
He loves you very much, Francine!

876
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:25,550
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.

877
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:27,847
<i>You know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.</i>

878
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,047
<i>And don't eyeball me, man!</i>

879
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:31,124
<i>You're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?</i>

880
00:46:31,191 --> 00:46:32,283
Terry!

881
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,054
He does not approve of your behavior!

882
00:46:34,161 --> 00:46:36,129
Can you please go?

883
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:38,494
And you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?

884
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:43,830
<i>Let's go, Allen.</i>

885
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:46,864
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.

886
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,004
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

887
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,034
<i>You're kind of making things worse.</i>

888
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:03,487
<i>- You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

889
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:07,416
<i>Hey, I didn't know you could dance.</i>

890
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,830
We used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids,

891
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:12,262
show them how queer they were, okay?

892
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,193
- You learned to dance like that sarcastically? - Yeah, I guess.

893
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,831
Stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.

894
00:47:20,907 --> 00:47:24,070
<i>Stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.</i>

895
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,069
All right, Terry.

896
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:30,208
<i>Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.</i>

897
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,106
Here, check this out. Article from six months ago.

898
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:57,767
Talking about how the lottery is looking

899
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,278
to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.

900
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,107
<i>So he's dealing drugs?</i>

901
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:06,282
<i>No, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.</i>

902
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,220
<i>Look, I'm sorry. I just...</i>

903
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:16,624
I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.

904
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:18,529
What happened?

905
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:23,232
She was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?

906
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,804
<i>Called "The Art of Oral Sex"?</i>

907
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,769
<i>You know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.</i>

908
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,344
<i>It's always about her.</i>

909
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,713
<i>Yeah, that's... That's messed up.</i>

910
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,609
Hey, I got you a gift.

911
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:41,217
<i>I just saw something, and I thought of you, and so, I don't want it to be weird.</i>

912
00:48:41,288 --> 00:48:42,414
I just wanted to be nice.

913
00:48:42,522 --> 00:48:43,853
<i>Of course it's weird.</i>

914
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,755
<i>It's a grown man giving another man a present.</i>

915
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,759
There you go. Open it up.

916
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:52,263
<i>It's okay, you're welcome.</i>

917
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,767
I like to do things like that.

918
00:48:54,901 --> 00:48:56,960
Take a look what it says.

919
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:08,280
<i>You know, because we're both in law enforcement.</i>

920
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:09,939
We both like women.

921
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,042
<i>But I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.</i>

922
00:49:13,386 --> 00:49:15,547
<i>I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.</i>

923
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:16,919
Me, too.

924
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:23,490
<i>Real nice. You know, it's all class.</i>

925
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,131
<i>- Okay. - Don't do that shit any more.</i>

926
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:28,599
<i>Yeah, believe me, I won't.</i>

927
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,534
<i>Do you understand what's so funny about it, though?</i>

928
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:36,701
<i>'Cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.</i>

929
00:49:36,776 --> 00:49:39,609
<i>And at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI."</i>

930
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,844
<i>But then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?</i>

931
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:47,079
Get out of town. This is outrageous...

932
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:48,449
Shut up!

933
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:03,197
<i>I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours</i>

934
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,362
one of these days,

935
00:50:04,437 --> 00:50:06,598
<i>and it's gonna be glorious.</i>

936
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:12,805
<i>Shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?</i>

937
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:14,181
<i>For what? We're just going to check it out.</i>

938
00:50:14,181 --> 00:50:16,046
<i>I know, but it's procedure.</i>

939
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:19,244
Terry answers to no one.

940
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,081
I do what I do.

941
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:25,591
What accounting firm is closed at 11:00 a.m. On a Tuesday?

942
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:26,921
This is a shithole.

943
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:35,659
I love bombs.

944
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:38,932
<i>I can't hear! I can't hear!</i>

945
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,398
<i>There's blood blisters on my hands!</i>

946
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:43,567
Oh, my God!

947
00:50:43,643 --> 00:50:45,941
How do they walk away in movies without flinching

948
00:50:46,012 --> 00:50:47,741
when it explodes behind them?

949
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:51,079
<i>There's no way! I call bullshit on that!</i>

950
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:54,751
When they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star,

951
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:58,814
and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!

952
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:02,190
<i>Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!</i>

953
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:04,263
I need an MRI.

954
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:08,631
<i>I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.</i>

955
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:11,127
<i>There's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.</i>

956
00:51:11,204 --> 00:51:12,296
Please stop.

957
00:51:12,372 --> 00:51:14,101
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!

958
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:22,647
Fire Department said it was a gas leak, but no way. That was timed.

959
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:24,513
<i>They didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.</i>

960
00:51:24,618 --> 00:51:27,109
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?

961
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:29,815
<i>I'm tired of this. All right?</i>

962
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:32,449
<i>I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.</i>

963
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:34,652
I wanna go back to my desk.

964
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:38,220
Guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.

965
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:40,799
<i>You can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.</i>

966
00:51:40,867 --> 00:51:43,631
<i>You know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?</i>

967
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:46,638
<i>There's no explosions at my desk.</i>

968
00:51:46,706 --> 00:51:51,643
<i>There's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.</i>

969
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,709
What are you afraid of, man?

970
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:01,344
<i>I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?</i>

971
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:04,454
I was a sophomore in college.

972
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:09,920
The university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.

973
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:16,900
A classmate of mine, Brenda, in an effort to raise money and stay in school,

974
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,938
came up with a nifty plan

975
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,473
<i>where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.</i>

976
00:52:21,641 --> 00:52:23,233
I go on dates all the time,

977
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,437
with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.

978
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:28,878
And I kind of need somebody to help me out, like, you know, my partner in crime.

979
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:31,713
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

980
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:33,377
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.</i>

981
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:35,978
- Provide transportation services. - Yeah, yeah.

982
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:38,216
<i>- It's gonna be a good time. - Thanks so much for asking me.</i>

983
00:52:38,291 --> 00:52:40,759
<i>She said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay</i>

984
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:44,285
<i>and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.</i>

985
00:52:44,397 --> 00:52:47,662
- Oh, my God. You were a pimp. - What? God, no.

986
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,826
No, I was just trying to help a friend.

987
00:52:49,936 --> 00:52:52,496
<i>We started making a lot of money.</i>

988
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:56,407
<i>And wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends</i>

989
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:59,172
<i>decided they wanted to be a part of it.</i>

990
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:01,941
<i>Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting</i>

991
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,642
<i>while they gave me money.</i>

992
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,274
<i>That's called a stable of whores.</i>

993
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:11,123
<i>We decided I shouldn't use my real name. So we came up with the name "Gator."</i>

994
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,825
<i>I'm telling you, you were a pimp.</i>

995
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:15,520
No! Are you even listening to the story?

996
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:20,424
Anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror,

997
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,764
<i>and I don't like what I see.</i>

998
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:27,530
<i>I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.</i>

999
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:30,673
<i>You can't have a conscience in the pimp game.</i>

1000
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:33,173
One night, two of my favorite girls,

1001
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:35,474
<i>Candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in,"</i>

1002
00:53:35,548 --> 00:53:37,846
and they dropped me off at the emergency room.

1003
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:39,851
<i>That's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.</i>

1004
00:53:39,953 --> 00:53:45,152
I made a promise to myself and to her that I would never get out of control again.

1005
00:53:45,992 --> 00:53:47,357
So, as soon as I graduated from college,

1006
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,361
I became an accountant for the police department.

1007
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:53,693
The most stable job I could think of.

1008
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:57,701
An accountant for law and order.

1009
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:04,067
<i>I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.</i>

1010
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:06,873
<i>Don't worry. I got your back.</i>

1011
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,380
<i>Now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.</i>

1012
00:54:09,482 --> 00:54:13,248
<i>- I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around. - Okay.</i>

1013
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:16,316
<i>You can either walk the plank or take your panties off.</i>

1014
00:54:16,389 --> 00:54:18,016
<i>The choice is yours.</i>

1015
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:22,357
<i>- I want to take my panties off. - You've made a wise choice, you have.</i>

1016
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:27,230
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.

1017
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:29,029
Gentlemen, please.

1018
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:32,401
- Remember us, hotshot? - Of course I do. Please, sit.

1019
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:34,166
<i>There she blows.</i>

1020
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:39,841
Two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.

1021
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:43,041
Guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.

1022
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:45,613
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1023
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:49,620
Gas leak? The only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.

1024
00:54:49,722 --> 00:54:54,750
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.

1025
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:57,557
I absolutely abhor death.

1026
00:54:57,797 --> 00:55:01,255
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?

1027
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:03,232
<i>We know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.</i>

1028
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:05,635
<i>And we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.</i>

1029
00:55:05,738 --> 00:55:08,070
<i>You talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.</i>

1030
00:55:08,441 --> 00:55:11,205
God, this water is good. Terry, have you tried the water?

1031
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,890
Shut up, Allen.

1032
00:55:13,002 --> 00:55:16,267
<i>I assure you, I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

1033
00:55:16,372 --> 00:55:20,274
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up with the whole scaffolding business.

1034
00:55:20,376 --> 00:55:25,780
The cucumber accents the water in such a way that...

1035
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:31,682
Perhaps by way of apology, I can offer you my personal courtside seats

1036
00:55:31,754 --> 00:55:35,918
for the Knicks game, with access to the Ambassador Club.

1037
00:55:38,294 --> 00:55:43,425
<i>Come on, Knicks! Come on! I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!</i>

1038
00:55:44,767 --> 00:55:48,794
<i>Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.</i>

1039
00:55:48,904 --> 00:55:53,432
It is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.

1040
00:55:53,542 --> 00:55:54,804
Come on.

1041
00:55:55,645 --> 00:55:56,976
Call me!

1042
00:55:58,447 --> 00:56:00,244
- Excuse me. - That was a trick.

1043
00:56:00,316 --> 00:56:01,715
No more.

1044
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:07,154
<i>Gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.</i>

1045
00:56:10,493 --> 00:56:13,553
<i>Fantastic! You're so unbelievable!</i>

1046
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:19,967
Damn it. He did it again.

1047
00:56:20,936 --> 00:56:23,234
- Excuse me. - No more tickets.

1048
00:56:23,305 --> 00:56:25,239
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.

1049
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:28,572
<i>That's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.</i>

1050
00:56:28,644 --> 00:56:30,509
<i>No, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.</i>

1051
00:56:30,613 --> 00:56:32,638
No, I was very much looking forward to having a water.

1052
00:56:32,748 --> 00:56:37,185
<i>- How great is Jersey Boys? - It's not great. It's fantastic!</i>

1053
00:56:37,286 --> 00:56:40,619
You totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.

1054
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:42,317
Wow, what a musical.

1055
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:44,290
Hey. Get over here.

1056
00:56:45,428 --> 00:56:46,588
<i>- What's wrong with you? - What?</i>

1057
00:56:46,662 --> 00:56:48,152
<i>That's not what we're here for.</i>

1058
00:56:49,098 --> 00:56:51,157
<i>We're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?</i>

1059
00:56:51,467 --> 00:56:54,493
<i>It's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.</i>

1060
00:56:54,603 --> 00:56:55,934
I come strong, then you come in.

1061
00:56:56,005 --> 00:56:57,097
- You got it? - Yeah.

1062
00:56:57,173 --> 00:56:59,835
- I come strong, then you come in. - Right. Got it.

1063
00:56:59,942 --> 00:57:01,842
Now you listen to me, you piece of shit.

1064
00:57:02,111 --> 00:57:04,671
<i>It's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!</i>

1065
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:08,978
How did you cover your losses up? What drug cartel are you working with now?

1066
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:12,987
<i>- Okay, I'll talk to you, you're reasonable! - No, no, look at me!</i>

1067
00:57:13,055 --> 00:57:15,523
You wanna talk to me? You wanna talk to me?

1068
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:19,116
Allen, what are you doing? What are you doing? Allen!

1069
00:57:19,962 --> 00:57:22,192
<i>I'm gonna make you eat a plate of human shit!</i>

1070
00:57:22,865 --> 00:57:24,662
Get away from me!

1071
00:57:29,371 --> 00:57:30,838
Where is he?

1072
00:57:32,875 --> 00:57:35,469
<i>Look, I'm really sorry about that.</i>

1073
00:57:36,312 --> 00:57:38,837
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought,

1074
00:57:38,914 --> 00:57:42,543
<i>"Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that, since we're doing bad cop, bad cop."</i>

1075
00:57:42,651 --> 00:57:47,714
<i>What? No, I said, "Good cop, bad cop." I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.</i>

1076
00:57:47,823 --> 00:57:52,226
<i>Okay, then there it is. That's it. I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop."</i>

1077
00:57:52,561 --> 00:57:55,997
Well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.

1078
00:57:56,065 --> 00:57:58,158
<i>- Think it's his phone sheet. - Nice.</i>

1079
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:00,196
Seven calls to the lottery office.

1080
00:58:00,536 --> 00:58:02,060
That could be the evidence we need for Mauch.

1081
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,707
- Get back. Colombian drug lords. - Where are you getting that from?

1082
00:58:09,512 --> 00:58:10,706
Jesus!

1083
00:58:19,522 --> 00:58:21,956
<i>Can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?</i>

1084
00:58:29,765 --> 00:58:33,098
- We call this in, right? - Looks like we got all the evidence we need.

1085
00:58:33,202 --> 00:58:35,261
<i>I'm sorry, my butterfly.</i>

1086
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:39,574
<i>We'll load them up, send them back to go.</i>

1087
00:58:48,317 --> 00:58:51,616
- Holy shit. - What?

1088
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:54,416
What do you mean, what? Where are we?

1089
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:57,224
<i>We're in the high desert.</i>

1090
00:58:57,293 --> 00:59:01,059
They took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?

1091
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:02,654
- They took your wooden gun? - Yeah.

1092
00:59:09,238 --> 00:59:11,468
<i>- Hello? - Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.</i>

1093
00:59:11,574 --> 00:59:12,973
<i>Captain, it's Allen Gamble.</i>

1094
00:59:13,075 --> 00:59:14,906
<i>Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?</i>

1095
00:59:14,977 --> 00:59:17,275
<i>Captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.</i>

1096
00:59:17,346 --> 00:59:19,314
We are in Las Vegas, all right?

1097
00:59:19,415 --> 00:59:22,782
We were kidnapped, put on a freight train, and shipped out here.

1098
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:25,286
<i>Let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.</i>

1099
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:26,753
Captain, I am being straight with you.

1100
00:59:26,822 --> 00:59:29,154
<i>Look, we think something's going on, okay?</i>

1101
00:59:29,258 --> 00:59:32,125
We think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.

1102
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:37,632
<i>Wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?</i>

1103
00:59:38,133 --> 00:59:39,430
Terry, Captain wants to know

1104
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:41,435
how many times has he asked us to lay off of Ershon.

1105
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:42,595
Twice.

1106
00:59:43,439 --> 00:59:45,202
Twice. Terry says twice. I agree.

1107
00:59:45,307 --> 00:59:47,366
<i>I'm hanging up. I'm done.</i>

1108
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:56,175
I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand for that, a taste for that Pai Gow.

1109
00:59:56,886 --> 01:00:01,482
Martin and Fosse, super cops, in three, two...

1110
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:07,462
So, we busted that junkie. Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.

1111
01:00:08,564 --> 01:00:09,997
Solved the Castien case.

1112
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:12,863
<i>$74,000? That's all they took?</i>

1113
01:00:12,968 --> 01:00:15,198
<i>There's millions of dollars of diamonds in that place.</i>

1114
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:17,465
How about this, Gamble? How about you shut your face?

1115
01:00:17,539 --> 01:00:19,131
All right? Just shut it.

1116
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:20,835
<i>Hoitz, Gamble, Captain's looking for you.</i>

1117
01:00:23,812 --> 01:00:26,042
<i>I know it's off the subject, but is Kevlar copyrighted?</i>

1118
01:00:26,148 --> 01:00:27,410
- Captain? - Yeah.

1119
01:00:27,516 --> 01:00:30,007
- Is it a bad time? - No, come on. Come on.

1120
01:00:30,386 --> 01:00:32,217
- Not me, right? - Yeah, and you.

1121
01:00:32,321 --> 01:00:36,018
<i>Fellows, I'm sure you're familiar with the venerable DA Radford.</i>

1122
01:00:36,091 --> 01:00:37,752
He wanted to come down and pay us a visit.

1123
01:00:37,860 --> 01:00:39,088
Hello, gentlemen.

1124
01:00:39,194 --> 01:00:40,320
- Hello, sir. - Hey.

1125
01:00:40,396 --> 01:00:43,763
<i>- You know, I was talking to Gene here. - He prefers "Captain."</i>

1126
01:00:43,866 --> 01:00:47,358
<i>Yes, I was talking to Gene here, and, you know, it's funny.</i>

1127
01:00:47,670 --> 01:00:49,900
<i>I don't know what you two have been up to,</i>

1128
01:00:50,005 --> 01:00:53,372
<i>but I've been getting calls from people I don't ever get calls from.</i>

1129
01:00:53,442 --> 01:00:56,377
<i>In 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.</i>

1130
01:00:57,012 --> 01:00:58,707
When that happens, stop.

1131
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:03,376
<i>- Gene, how's the family? - Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.</i>

1132
01:01:03,452 --> 01:01:05,443
<i>- My son's bisexual, so... - Tremendous.</i>

1133
01:01:08,257 --> 01:01:09,781
Gentlemen, do we understand each other?

1134
01:01:11,093 --> 01:01:13,254
- Cut the crap! - Will do.

1135
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:19,066
Guy never comes down here.

1136
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:21,967
<i>Twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.</i>

1137
01:01:22,071 --> 01:01:25,234
<i>- He's a heavyweight cat, that guy. - He was sitting right here.</i>

1138
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:29,077
Yeah. I think you missed the point. Anyway, look.

1139
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:32,580
Blue and white found your firearms down by the Hudson River. Here you go, Terry.

1140
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:35,739
You know what?

1141
01:01:36,418 --> 01:01:38,386
<i>I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.</i>

1142
01:01:38,454 --> 01:01:40,319
- To give me back my real gun? - No.

1143
01:01:40,422 --> 01:01:42,481
<i>'Cause I'm gonna give you this.</i>

1144
01:01:43,225 --> 01:01:46,388
<i>It's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble</i>

1145
01:01:46,996 --> 01:01:49,556
and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.

1146
01:01:50,933 --> 01:01:55,597
<i>We were abducted, Captain! This shit is real! Ershon's dirty. He's targeting the lottery!</i>

1147
01:01:55,671 --> 01:02:00,574
Next, I want you guys to hand in all the evidence you think you have to the SEC.

1148
01:02:00,642 --> 01:02:02,473
<i>The financial district's under their jurisdiction.</i>

1149
01:02:02,578 --> 01:02:05,046
<i>Don't you get it? This case is talking to us!</i>

1150
01:02:05,114 --> 01:02:08,242
<i>I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!</i>

1151
01:02:08,317 --> 01:02:11,218
<i>You know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.</i>

1152
01:02:11,286 --> 01:02:14,744
- They fly, they fly a little bit. - Yeah, about as much as a penguin.

1153
01:02:14,823 --> 01:02:18,452
<i>One more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.</i>

1154
01:02:19,161 --> 01:02:21,721
Was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?

1155
01:02:22,564 --> 01:02:23,622
<i>I don't even understand the reference.</i>

1156
01:02:24,166 --> 01:02:26,293
<i>- You don't understand what you said? - I don't know what that is.</i>

1157
01:02:26,402 --> 01:02:27,835
Get out. Go.

1158
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:40,810
How did they get that story?

1159
01:02:42,351 --> 01:02:45,320
<i>I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.</i>

1160
01:02:45,421 --> 01:02:46,479
Hey, guys.

1161
01:02:46,855 --> 01:02:50,757
<i>There's a proxy vote for a big reinvestment of the pension coming up,</i>

1162
01:02:50,826 --> 01:02:53,693
- so if you just wanna come by the old... - Damn it, Bob!

1163
01:02:53,796 --> 01:02:54,854
Let me ask you something.

1164
01:02:54,963 --> 01:02:57,363
What do you even do around here besides interrupt people?

1165
01:02:58,067 --> 01:03:00,467
Well, I serve as treasurer to the union.

1166
01:03:00,536 --> 01:03:03,369
I make a wicked pot of decaf.

1167
01:03:03,472 --> 01:03:06,703
<i>Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!</i>

1168
01:03:08,644 --> 01:03:12,171
<i>Probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.</i>

1169
01:03:13,082 --> 01:03:14,879
<i>I'm gonna go for a walk.</i>

1170
01:03:14,983 --> 01:03:16,245
- Bob! - Say something.

1171
01:03:16,351 --> 01:03:18,216
Come on! Bob!

1172
01:03:18,320 --> 01:03:21,221
<i>I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.</i>

1173
01:03:39,041 --> 01:03:44,138
<i>Actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.</i>

1174
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:46,606
<i>- This coffee table? - Yes. We don't put drinks on it.</i>

1175
01:03:50,385 --> 01:03:53,047
- Five hundred thousand? - He can read! Congratulations.

1176
01:03:53,522 --> 01:03:55,683
<i>- What? - I'm sorry, are you in the right place?</i>

1177
01:03:55,757 --> 01:03:58,055
<i>Or not? I'm...</i>

1178
01:03:59,261 --> 01:04:00,455
- Terry. - Does he... Okay.

1179
01:04:00,529 --> 01:04:03,794
- Well... - Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?

1180
01:04:05,033 --> 01:04:09,402
<i>- I want to be with you. - No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.</i>

1181
01:04:09,771 --> 01:04:12,399
You know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.

1182
01:04:13,242 --> 01:04:15,267
<i>Instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?</i>

1183
01:04:15,444 --> 01:04:17,002
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!

1184
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:19,513
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.

1185
01:04:19,882 --> 01:04:24,080
The chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.

1186
01:04:24,553 --> 01:04:26,544
<i>You think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?</i>

1187
01:04:26,922 --> 01:04:31,382
<i>This coffee table isn't the ego. It represents our shattered sense of community</i>

1188
01:04:31,727 --> 01:04:33,490
in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.

1189
01:04:33,795 --> 01:04:36,355
Looks like the work of Cindy Sherman or Frank Stella.

1190
01:04:37,032 --> 01:04:38,329
How did you know that, Terry?

1191
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:40,199
I took some classes at RISD

1192
01:04:40,269 --> 01:04:42,601
so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.

1193
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:45,071
<i>- Terry, lower your voice! - I don't have to lower my voice.</i>

1194
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,938
- Is this man bothering you? - Are you actually having sex with this creep?

1195
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:50,108
<i>Terry, he's gay. Okay?</i>

1196
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,042
<i>He's even wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm gay"!</i>

1197
01:04:54,316 --> 01:04:56,181
All right? And also, he is my boss.

1198
01:04:56,518 --> 01:04:57,678
Happy for you, man. Good.

1199
01:04:57,753 --> 01:04:59,618
<i>Can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.</i>

1200
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:03,154
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.

1201
01:05:03,592 --> 01:05:05,651
Nice toot, sailor. Jesus.

1202
01:05:06,895 --> 01:05:08,829
Terry, what are you doing?

1203
01:05:09,331 --> 01:05:12,732
Look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?

1204
01:05:13,068 --> 01:05:14,296
Just give me one more year.

1205
01:05:14,736 --> 01:05:17,136
<i>Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.</i>

1206
01:05:17,639 --> 01:05:18,697
Fine.

1207
01:05:19,174 --> 01:05:22,371
<i>- Terry, don't touch that! Terry! - Oh, my God!</i>

1208
01:05:22,711 --> 01:05:24,645
<i>I don't need this shit. I don't need you!</i>

1209
01:05:25,647 --> 01:05:27,740
<i>And when you call me, I'm not coming back!</i>

1210
01:05:29,017 --> 01:05:32,077
<i>- Oh, boy! Over the top! - How outr?</i>

1211
01:05:32,454 --> 01:05:34,581
<i>I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!</i>

1212
01:05:35,857 --> 01:05:38,189
- Fresh! Energetic! - I love his rawness!

1213
01:05:38,594 --> 01:05:42,121
<i>Stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!</i>

1214
01:05:42,431 --> 01:05:44,262
- Yes, you are. - Bravo!

1215
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:47,296
<i>I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!</i>

1216
01:05:47,970 --> 01:05:50,063
Yes! Yes!

1217
01:05:59,681 --> 01:06:02,275
<i>These braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.</i>

1218
01:06:02,384 --> 01:06:04,079
<i>- Sweetie. - You know what, I'm sitting here thinking,</i>

1219
01:06:04,186 --> 01:06:07,349
<i>"Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole</i>

1220
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,390
<i>"and serve it to their husband?"</i>

1221
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:12,894
<i>- You would. - You are being awful. What's wrong?</i>

1222
01:06:12,961 --> 01:06:17,694
<i>- Captain took us off the case. - I'm sorry.</i>

1223
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:23,435
I told Terry about my dark days in college, and it brought up some feelings.

1224
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:29,072
<i>Well, honeydick, that was a long time ago. You're not that same person you were.</i>

1225
01:06:29,177 --> 01:06:32,613
<i>No, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.</i>

1226
01:06:32,714 --> 01:06:35,706
It wants to get out. It wants to walk around.

1227
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,912
It wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.

1228
01:06:39,021 --> 01:06:43,549
<i>And it wants to walk up with the people and say, "Hey, Gator don't play no shit."</i>

1229
01:06:43,892 --> 01:06:45,257
- You feel me? - Yeah.

1230
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:49,421
Gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.

1231
01:06:52,467 --> 01:06:54,458
<i>- Sweetie, I'm sorry. - It's okay.</i>

1232
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:58,470
- I just... - Remember that night we met?

1233
01:06:59,241 --> 01:07:03,905
<i>The attending physician told me, "We got a drugged-out pimp in the back."</i>

1234
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:08,082
And I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain,

1235
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:09,708
and I saw you.

1236
01:07:10,452 --> 01:07:12,784
You were weak, scared,

1237
01:07:13,355 --> 01:07:17,451
ass up, inflamed, crying.

1238
01:07:17,559 --> 01:07:22,656
<i>At that moment, I knew. "Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry."</i>

1239
01:07:23,632 --> 01:07:28,126
<i>Pimps don't cry</i>

1240
01:07:29,438 --> 01:07:31,963
<i>Pimps don't cry</i>

1241
01:07:32,074 --> 01:07:34,975
<i>No, they don't</i>

1242
01:07:35,344 --> 01:07:38,313
<i>They don't shed a tear</i>

1243
01:07:39,014 --> 01:07:44,350
<i>Pimps don't cry</i>

1244
01:07:44,619 --> 01:07:46,519
<i>They never shed a tear</i>

1245
01:07:51,426 --> 01:07:54,862
<i>Come lay with me. Be safe, and let's make love. Come on.</i>

1246
01:07:54,963 --> 01:07:57,363
<i>Every time you say, "Be safe," it tears me apart.</i>

1247
01:07:57,466 --> 01:08:00,026
<i>You gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.</i>

1248
01:08:01,636 --> 01:08:04,127
<i>Allen, I'm pregnant.</i>

1249
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:06,371
Whose baby is that?

1250
01:08:06,475 --> 01:08:09,933
<i>Who's the man who did that to you? Gator's bitches better be using jimmies!</i>

1251
01:08:11,780 --> 01:08:14,840
<i>I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.</i>

1252
01:08:14,950 --> 01:08:16,542
Oh, my God.

1253
01:08:18,453 --> 01:08:19,852
You need to leave.

1254
01:08:19,955 --> 01:08:23,550
Get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!

1255
01:08:40,342 --> 01:08:41,240
Hey.

1256
01:08:42,511 --> 01:08:45,036
Hey. What are you doing here?

1257
01:08:47,516 --> 01:08:52,579
Come here when I have lady troubles, which means I come here about every night.

1258
01:08:52,687 --> 01:08:54,712
What are you doing here?

1259
01:08:55,891 --> 01:08:58,382
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

1260
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:01,559
She threw me out.

1261
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,657
<i>Well, you're not a cop till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.</i>

1262
01:09:05,734 --> 01:09:09,568
Does it bother you that the Castien robbers only took 74 grand in diamonds?

1263
01:09:09,905 --> 01:09:12,373
<i>They're junkies. Who cares? I mean...</i>

1264
01:09:12,441 --> 01:09:16,241
<i>I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.</i>

1265
01:09:16,344 --> 01:09:17,242
How you fellas doing?

1266
01:09:18,914 --> 01:09:22,077
<i>We're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here</i>

1267
01:09:22,184 --> 01:09:23,378
if you wanna join us.

1268
01:09:23,485 --> 01:09:25,544
<i>You're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?</i>

1269
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:28,754
<i>Here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos</i>

1270
01:09:29,191 --> 01:09:31,125
<i>with fingers in each other's pooper</i>

1271
01:09:31,193 --> 01:09:33,991
<i>in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.</i>

1272
01:09:34,062 --> 01:09:35,222
<i>It's gonna be a nice evening.</i>

1273
01:09:35,597 --> 01:09:37,895
<i>Well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.</i>

1274
01:09:38,099 --> 01:09:39,191
Let me rephrase it.

1275
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:42,434
We got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle,

1276
01:09:42,637 --> 01:09:45,800
<i>and we're just get in there and we're gonna put some D's in some A's.</i>

1277
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:47,972
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?

1278
01:09:48,043 --> 01:09:50,568
- How do you know who we are? - You left a note in that car.

1279
01:09:50,679 --> 01:09:53,239
<i>- Police, shithead. - He's a copper. We gotta go. Come on!</i>

1280
01:09:53,348 --> 01:09:55,179
<i>Hey! Goose it, boys! They're cops!</i>

1281
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:57,413
<i>Rub your dicks on the car as you're running away!</i>

1282
01:09:57,486 --> 01:09:59,818
You turned my beautiful Prius into a nightmare!

1283
01:09:59,921 --> 01:10:03,584
We are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again!

1284
01:10:05,727 --> 01:10:07,422
<i>I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight.</i>

1285
01:10:07,496 --> 01:10:09,293
<i>Fortunately, I know where you're gonna be drinking.</i>

1286
01:10:09,397 --> 01:10:11,729
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.

1287
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:13,962
- No, I already have a beer. - No, no, no, no.

1288
01:10:14,302 --> 01:10:16,634
<i>I'm talking about doing some serious drinking.</i>

1289
01:10:16,738 --> 01:10:18,069
Drinking with Terry Hoitz.

1290
01:11:06,955 --> 01:11:08,820
This sucks, man. Work our ass off on this case,

1291
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,482
now we gotta hand over all of our evidence?

1292
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:11,821
<i>Yeah, it's not right.</i>

1293
01:11:11,893 --> 01:11:13,952
<i>Oh, my God, I'm hungover.</i>

1294
01:11:16,298 --> 01:11:17,094
So, you guys are law enforcement?

1295
01:11:17,766 --> 01:11:19,700
<i>Yeah, we're an independent government agency who,</i>

1296
01:11:19,768 --> 01:11:21,668
along with the FBI and the Federal Reserve,

1297
01:11:21,736 --> 01:11:23,897
regulate the stock market and corporate fraud.

1298
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,867
And the Federal Reserve is a prison?

1299
01:11:27,108 --> 01:11:29,872
<i>No, basically, it's a held-for-profit bank that sets interest rates</i>

1300
01:11:29,945 --> 01:11:31,071
and loans money to other banks.

1301
01:11:31,913 --> 01:11:34,108
- Is that a wastebasket? - Yeah, right there.

1302
01:11:34,215 --> 01:11:35,580
Thank you.

1303
01:11:37,285 --> 01:11:40,618
- You all right? - Holy hell!

1304
01:11:42,257 --> 01:11:43,952
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1305
01:11:44,559 --> 01:11:45,924
I got so drunk last night.

1306
01:11:46,027 --> 01:11:49,895
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste was astronaut food.

1307
01:11:50,966 --> 01:11:52,763
Come on in, fellas.

1308
01:11:53,868 --> 01:11:56,063
<i>You gotta be kidding me. You're Ershon's lawyer.</i>

1309
01:11:56,137 --> 01:11:57,900
<i>We're turning over our investigation to you?</i>

1310
01:11:58,306 --> 01:12:00,570
Let me assure you there will be no conflict of interest

1311
01:12:00,642 --> 01:12:02,109
between me and David Ershon.

1312
01:12:02,210 --> 01:12:06,306
And if this were an actual investigation, I would immediately recuse myself.

1313
01:12:06,414 --> 01:12:10,646
This is all the evidence we have, and I truly hope you take this seriously.

1314
01:12:10,752 --> 01:12:12,049
Yes. Very much so.

1315
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,883
<i>From everything I've heard, I understand</i>

1316
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:17,220
you guys are the best at these types of investigations.

1317
01:12:17,292 --> 01:12:20,056
Outside of Enron and AIG

1318
01:12:20,128 --> 01:12:21,595
and Bernie Madoff,

1319
01:12:22,230 --> 01:12:24,926
WorldCom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.

1320
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:26,900
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.

1321
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:28,765
<i>- Would you like a seat, or you're fine? - No, I'm good.</i>

1322
01:12:28,837 --> 01:12:30,464
Okay. Let me just assure you fellas,

1323
01:12:30,939 --> 01:12:33,430
David Ershon is an upstanding citizen.

1324
01:12:34,175 --> 01:12:35,938
I am playing squash with him tonight at the club,

1325
01:12:36,011 --> 01:12:36,841
<i>and we're having dinner.</i>

1326
01:12:37,412 --> 01:12:39,505
You listen to me, you Windsor knot-wearing monkey,

1327
01:12:39,614 --> 01:12:41,673
you play squash with Ershon, right?

1328
01:12:41,783 --> 01:12:45,014
<i>Your kids go to school with his? How would you know if he's clean or not?</i>

1329
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,781
I will take a look at your evidence,

1330
01:12:46,855 --> 01:12:48,083
and I will take a second look at the financials.

1331
01:12:48,790 --> 01:12:50,849
And when I come back and bust your ass,

1332
01:12:50,959 --> 01:12:53,450
<i>we're locking David Ershon in the Federal Reserve!</i>

1333
01:12:53,528 --> 01:12:54,995
<i>He still doesn't understand the concept.</i>

1334
01:13:16,418 --> 01:13:17,942
What are you doing?

1335
01:13:18,486 --> 01:13:21,785
<i>We just handed all of our evidence over to the bad guy's lawyer!</i>

1336
01:13:21,856 --> 01:13:24,120
Are you a big man, huh?

1337
01:13:24,192 --> 01:13:25,659
<i>- I'm talking to you. - What?</i>

1338
01:13:25,827 --> 01:13:28,591
<i>You wake up in the morning, you say, "I'm putting on my big boy pants"?</i>

1339
01:13:28,663 --> 01:13:29,891
<i>"Look, I'm wearing a belt!</i>

1340
01:13:29,998 --> 01:13:32,125
<i>- "I've got big boy pants on!" - No!</i>

1341
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,130
You borrow a little jacket, you go?

1342
01:13:34,335 --> 01:13:36,394
<i>You take your lunch 'cause you got big boy pants on?</i>

1343
01:13:36,905 --> 01:13:38,736
You got your big boy pants and your snack?

1344
01:13:39,507 --> 01:13:41,134
I could say big, loud things!

1345
01:13:41,643 --> 01:13:43,042
I could be demonstrative!

1346
01:13:43,378 --> 01:13:45,278
<i>- Stop! - We don't, we don't do this!</i>

1347
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:47,473
<i>You're scaring the shit out of me, man! Stop it!</i>

1348
01:13:47,582 --> 01:13:50,779
Is this how you conduct yourself? In a democracy?

1349
01:13:50,885 --> 01:13:52,546
What the hell are you doing, man?

1350
01:13:52,987 --> 01:13:57,390
<i>I'm so tired of you getting angry and yelling all the time.</i>

1351
01:13:58,293 --> 01:13:59,954
<i>It's exhausting.</i>

1352
01:14:02,097 --> 01:14:03,962
<i>I feel like I'm partners with the Hulk.</i>

1353
01:14:04,399 --> 01:14:06,890
<i>You wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?</i>

1354
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:10,335
<i>'Cause the more I try and do right, the more I screw things up.</i>

1355
01:14:11,072 --> 01:14:16,100
<i>We've got a possible jumper at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.</i>

1356
01:14:16,177 --> 01:14:18,441
<i>All units, fire department, en route.</i>

1357
01:14:18,513 --> 01:14:20,640
<i>- SEC. - Beaman's office.</i>

1358
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:22,274
We have to go.

1359
01:14:22,484 --> 01:14:24,247
- But the Captain. - We have to go, Allen.

1360
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:29,018
<i>All units, I need a respondent. Possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.</i>

1361
01:14:40,168 --> 01:14:42,363
<i>Shit. It's Beaman!</i>

1362
01:14:43,171 --> 01:14:46,004
<i>- He's gotta know something. - Wesley!</i>

1363
01:14:46,274 --> 01:14:48,105
Detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.

1364
01:14:48,543 --> 01:14:50,636
I took an online class at University of Phoenix on negotiating.

1365
01:14:51,212 --> 01:14:53,373
<i>I'm gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.</i>

1366
01:14:53,481 --> 01:14:55,847
- I got no bullhorn. - Does anyone have a bullhorn?

1367
01:14:55,950 --> 01:14:58,145
- Bullhorn, anyone? - Truck.

1368
01:14:59,187 --> 01:15:01,178
Police business. I need to use your PA system.

1369
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:02,517
Okay, let me turn it on.

1370
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:07,292
<i>Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?</i>

1371
01:15:07,362 --> 01:15:10,559
<i>It's Wesley. I know Ershon's Wesley's...</i>

1372
01:15:10,665 --> 01:15:13,498
<i>Look, there's a lot to live for in this life.</i>

1373
01:15:13,568 --> 01:15:18,631
<i>A lot of great things, like soda pop, big fresh can of soda pop.</i>

1374
01:15:18,706 --> 01:15:20,071
They do not care!

1375
01:15:20,175 --> 01:15:22,473
Give me this. I know how to talk to him.

1376
01:15:22,544 --> 01:15:26,207
<i>Listen, we all know you're a scumbag, and nobody cares about you.</i>

1377
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:27,645
<i>Rotten piece of shit.</i>

1378
01:15:27,715 --> 01:15:29,683
<i>That's worse than what I was saying.</i>

1379
01:15:30,084 --> 01:15:31,676
<i>I'm not gonna lie to you, Don.</i>

1380
01:15:31,753 --> 01:15:35,519
<i>People down here are starting to murmur that you don't have the balls to do it.</i>

1381
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,915
<i>- I don't care! - Yeah.</i>

1382
01:15:38,026 --> 01:15:40,358
<i>I say you can do it.</i>

1383
01:15:41,095 --> 01:15:45,088
<i>I mean, I don't want you to jump. I'm just saying you have the capability.</i>

1384
01:15:45,700 --> 01:15:46,758
<i>Look, he's flying!</i>

1385
01:15:52,507 --> 01:15:53,735
Stop that.

1386
01:15:54,509 --> 01:15:56,374
Half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.

1387
01:15:56,444 --> 01:15:59,436
<i>Look at this, it's a clear sign of a struggle. Make sure you get this, all right?</i>

1388
01:16:00,315 --> 01:16:03,182
<i>Detectives, all your work's done here. You can go.</i>

1389
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:04,843
What about Ershon targeting the lottery?

1390
01:16:04,919 --> 01:16:09,083
You know why Ershon was calling down to the lottery offices all those times?

1391
01:16:09,190 --> 01:16:11,181
Because he was hooking up with the Powerball girl,

1392
01:16:11,259 --> 01:16:13,557
the one on TV with all the numbered balls.

1393
01:16:13,661 --> 01:16:15,822
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him last week.

1394
01:16:16,331 --> 01:16:18,162
It was right there in front of you the whole time.

1395
01:16:18,233 --> 01:16:20,201
<i>- Can't be. - You guys are getting transferred.</i>

1396
01:16:20,268 --> 01:16:22,395
- What? - Traffic.

1397
01:16:22,503 --> 01:16:23,595
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

1398
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:27,368
<i>You, you're gonna walk a beat downtown. You're gonna walk a beat downtown.</i>

1399
01:16:27,442 --> 01:16:29,774
<i>- It's done. No, no. It's done. - Captain, what are you talking about?</i>

1400
01:16:29,878 --> 01:16:31,743
- Save yourselves some gas. - Captain!

1401
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:33,679
Is there an appeal process we can...

1402
01:16:33,748 --> 01:16:36,911
Had to do what you had to do, Captain.

1403
01:16:37,018 --> 01:16:39,213
Wow! That hurt.

1404
01:16:41,356 --> 01:16:43,517
<i>- Excuse me. Where's my car? - They towed it.</i>

1405
01:16:43,591 --> 01:16:46,059
Couple of homeless people were messing around in it.

1406
01:16:46,127 --> 01:16:49,790
<i>- That's an official police car. - Could have fooled me.</i>

1407
01:16:54,936 --> 01:16:56,233
Wow, Mauch was upset, huh?

1408
01:16:56,771 --> 01:16:57,931
Really?

1409
01:16:58,039 --> 01:17:00,405
The only thing I had to be proud of in my life was being a detective.

1410
01:17:00,475 --> 01:17:03,035
<i>That was all I had. Now it's gone.</i>

1411
01:17:03,778 --> 01:17:06,269
I know. I know. You still got me.

1412
01:17:06,381 --> 01:17:09,908
<i>Don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.</i>

1413
01:17:09,984 --> 01:17:12,214
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.

1414
01:17:12,553 --> 01:17:14,646
<i>I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.</i>

1415
01:17:14,756 --> 01:17:19,284
<i>It's a real case, and I'm a real cop. We just got the wrong target for Ershon.</i>

1416
01:17:19,394 --> 01:17:21,624
- You carry a rape whistle. - This is real cop work.

1417
01:17:21,729 --> 01:17:24,562
There is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?

1418
01:17:24,632 --> 01:17:28,068
You got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.

1419
01:17:28,136 --> 01:17:29,728
Leave me alone.

1420
01:17:30,338 --> 01:17:31,828
<i>A mutt case.</i>

1421
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,465
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?

1422
01:17:34,575 --> 01:17:36,736
<i>A broken partnership.</i>

1423
01:17:36,811 --> 01:17:37,937
<i>I'm a cop!</i>

1424
01:17:38,012 --> 01:17:41,675
<i>And getting busted down to a shitty assignment.</i>

1425
01:17:41,783 --> 01:17:44,843
<i>Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.</i>

1426
01:17:47,622 --> 01:17:50,682
<i>But sometimes when you get your ass kicked,</i>

1427
01:17:51,926 --> 01:17:54,622
<i>that's when you find out what's real...</i>

1428
01:17:56,965 --> 01:17:58,990
<i>... and what needs doing.</i>

1429
01:18:04,939 --> 01:18:06,998
<i>Whether it's directing traffic...</i>

1430
01:18:07,108 --> 01:18:08,132
Come on!

1431
01:18:08,609 --> 01:18:12,045
<i>... or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.</i>

1432
01:18:23,524 --> 01:18:25,617
- Do you work here? - Yeah, I do.

1433
01:18:25,693 --> 01:18:28,526
The wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.

1434
01:18:28,629 --> 01:18:30,187
They also did damage to your office?

1435
01:18:30,298 --> 01:18:32,823
Some police officers came by and sealed it off.

1436
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,231
Do you recall what they looked like?

1437
01:18:34,335 --> 01:18:37,031
One of them had an Australian accent.

1438
01:18:37,572 --> 01:18:41,372
<i>You don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?</i>

1439
01:18:41,476 --> 01:18:44,843
No. Our main client is Lendl Global.

1440
01:18:44,912 --> 01:18:46,539
Can I ask what this is about?

1441
01:18:59,994 --> 01:19:02,224
Gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!

1442
01:19:11,606 --> 01:19:13,699
<i>'Cause that's what a real cop is.</i>

1443
01:19:13,775 --> 01:19:16,266
<i>No, I didn't say "Lock her up." I never said, "Lock her up."</i>

1444
01:19:16,377 --> 01:19:19,175
<i>A guy who does what needs to be done.</i>

1445
01:19:19,247 --> 01:19:23,206
<i>A guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.</i>

1446
01:19:23,284 --> 01:19:24,911
<i>And then you move to Florida.</i>

1447
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,354
One, two, three, attack!

1448
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:39,260
<i>Terry, it's me.</i>

1449
01:19:39,367 --> 01:19:41,597
<i>- Tap out. Tap out. - It's me, Allen.</i>

1450
01:19:41,702 --> 01:19:43,260
Are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?

1451
01:19:43,371 --> 01:19:45,032
<i>I'm tapping out!</i>

1452
01:19:45,907 --> 01:19:48,933
You crazy? What are you doing, man?

1453
01:19:49,043 --> 01:19:50,476
<i>- They might be watching us. - Could've killed you.</i>

1454
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:51,704
- Turn out the lights. - What?

1455
01:19:51,779 --> 01:19:52,871
- They could be watching us. - Who?

1456
01:19:53,214 --> 01:19:55,739
I found some big information, okay?

1457
01:19:55,817 --> 01:19:58,945
- About what? - Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.

1458
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:02,051
<i>How'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.</i>

1459
01:20:02,123 --> 01:20:04,591
<i>- We can't be too careful. - What are you talking about?</i>

1460
01:20:04,659 --> 01:20:07,822
<i>- This place might be bugged. - There's no bugs in here.</i>

1461
01:20:12,100 --> 01:20:15,092
First off, I missed you.

1462
01:20:15,169 --> 01:20:17,967
<i>- What's going on? - Did you hear what I said?</i>

1463
01:20:18,072 --> 01:20:22,065
- Fine, I kind of missed you, too. - Thank you.

1464
01:20:22,143 --> 01:20:26,443
Okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.

1465
01:20:26,514 --> 01:20:28,812
<i>- It's Lendl Global. - What?</i>

1466
01:20:28,916 --> 01:20:31,441
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction

1467
01:20:31,519 --> 01:20:34,511
so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.

1468
01:20:34,622 --> 01:20:37,819
They then altered all the records to cover the losses

1469
01:20:37,925 --> 01:20:40,689
that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.

1470
01:20:40,928 --> 01:20:44,261
<i>You're not supposed to be doing this. You're supposed to be walking the beat.</i>

1471
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:46,926
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?

1472
01:20:47,435 --> 01:20:49,460
This is bad, Allen. This is bad.

1473
01:20:49,537 --> 01:20:52,005
No wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.

1474
01:20:52,106 --> 01:20:54,199
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.

1475
01:20:54,308 --> 01:20:56,276
<i>- That's why they killed him. - Man.</i>

1476
01:20:56,344 --> 01:20:57,504
<i>Here's the other thing.</i>

1477
01:20:57,612 --> 01:20:59,603
<i>Tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.</i>

1478
01:20:59,814 --> 01:21:01,179
<i>Ershon's leading it.</i>

1479
01:21:01,282 --> 01:21:04,149
<i>I still can't figure out who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with,</i>

1480
01:21:04,218 --> 01:21:05,378
but we gotta stop it.

1481
01:21:05,486 --> 01:21:07,147
<i>It's time to let the peacock fly.</i>

1482
01:21:08,189 --> 01:21:10,054
<i>I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.</i>

1483
01:21:10,491 --> 01:21:12,618
<i>So do I. We're cops.</i>

1484
01:21:12,693 --> 01:21:17,221
<i>No. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.</i>

1485
01:21:17,331 --> 01:21:18,355
What?

1486
01:21:18,966 --> 01:21:22,732
<i>I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.</i>

1487
01:21:22,837 --> 01:21:25,328
What is this traffic bullshit?

1488
01:21:29,143 --> 01:21:32,670
<i>- What are you talking about? - I'm talking about my life.</i>

1489
01:21:32,747 --> 01:21:35,477
The corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.

1490
01:21:35,550 --> 01:21:39,247
<i>It's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.</i>

1491
01:21:39,353 --> 01:21:42,379
<i>There's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.</i>

1492
01:21:42,490 --> 01:21:43,650
<i>You've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.</i>

1493
01:21:43,724 --> 01:21:46,352
What happened to you? What happened to this being our time?

1494
01:21:46,661 --> 01:21:48,822
<i>No way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.</i>

1495
01:21:50,064 --> 01:21:52,931
<i>- Get in the car. - Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.</i>

1496
01:21:54,502 --> 01:21:58,336
<i>- Apartment pop. Now get in the car. - You're not gonna shoot me.</i>

1497
01:21:58,406 --> 01:22:00,931
<i>Okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.</i>

1498
01:22:01,175 --> 01:22:02,369
So stop pointing it at me.

1499
01:22:02,443 --> 01:22:06,504
<i>Look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?</i>

1500
01:22:06,747 --> 01:22:07,907
<i>For what? He doesn't care.</i>

1501
01:22:08,015 --> 01:22:11,178
<i>He's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.</i>

1502
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:13,516
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.

1503
01:22:13,588 --> 01:22:16,386
Turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.

1504
01:22:17,058 --> 01:22:18,423
<i>I hope I'm not alone.</i>

1505
01:22:19,227 --> 01:22:21,752
Hope you bring it.

1506
01:22:23,464 --> 01:22:25,591
We got a big day out there. Big one.

1507
01:22:25,700 --> 01:22:28,191
We got a full moon. People are gonna be amped, all right?

1508
01:22:28,569 --> 01:22:31,060
<i>Let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?</i>

1509
01:22:32,607 --> 01:22:33,699
The new bathmats are in.

1510
01:22:36,544 --> 01:22:40,742
One more thing. We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.

1511
01:22:40,815 --> 01:22:44,307
<i>Jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.</i>

1512
01:22:44,418 --> 01:22:45,578
<i>Well, don't ignore it.</i>

1513
01:22:45,653 --> 01:22:48,884
If you live in Crown Heights, you know, walk in pairs.

1514
01:22:48,956 --> 01:22:53,290
<i>Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories. Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.</i>

1515
01:22:53,394 --> 01:22:56,989
<i>I gotta go. Go get 'em. Let's be careful out there.</i>

1516
01:22:59,066 --> 01:23:00,226
The oak.

1517
01:23:00,301 --> 01:23:03,828
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?

1518
01:23:03,938 --> 01:23:04,996
And these chopping boards?

1519
01:23:05,273 --> 01:23:06,331
Hey, Captain.

1520
01:23:07,775 --> 01:23:10,300
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?

1521
01:23:10,411 --> 01:23:12,174
What are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?

1522
01:23:12,680 --> 01:23:16,343
- I need you to be straight with me. - Straight with us.

1523
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:19,146
Hey, Terry. Look at this.

1524
01:23:19,253 --> 01:23:22,916
- I thought you were working traffic today. - Let them block the box.

1525
01:23:23,324 --> 01:23:26,782
<i>- Besides, partners' code, right? - Thanks.</i>

1526
01:23:28,329 --> 01:23:30,923
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?

1527
01:23:32,366 --> 01:23:35,460
<i>All right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.</i>

1528
01:23:35,536 --> 01:23:38,835
You really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.

1529
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:40,873
<i>Ershon's connected to all the higher ups,</i>

1530
01:23:40,975 --> 01:23:43,842
and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?

1531
01:23:44,478 --> 01:23:46,639
You keep hiding from shit in the world,

1532
01:23:46,714 --> 01:23:48,978
and eventually the world comes to your front door.

1533
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:51,680
<i>- Nice. - That's very nice.</i>

1534
01:23:51,786 --> 01:23:53,344
<i>I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.</i>

1535
01:23:53,888 --> 01:23:57,881
You keep this thing real quiet, and you make sure you have real evidence,

1536
01:23:57,992 --> 01:23:59,550
<i>and maybe I'll see what I can do.</i>

1537
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:00,854
But if you make a lot of noise

1538
01:24:00,961 --> 01:24:04,124
and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,

1539
01:24:04,198 --> 01:24:05,722
I am out, okay?

1540
01:24:05,866 --> 01:24:07,163
<i>Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.</i>

1541
01:24:07,234 --> 01:24:11,637
<i>But there's one case, one case in a career where you go all in.</i>

1542
01:24:11,706 --> 01:24:12,832
This is it.

1543
01:24:13,407 --> 01:24:16,740
All right. Then you do us proud.

1544
01:24:17,244 --> 01:24:18,541
<i>'Cause I don't want no scrubs.</i>

1545
01:24:19,246 --> 01:24:21,806
- Really? - No.

1546
01:24:21,882 --> 01:24:25,215
<i>- You're not aware that's a TLC song? - I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

1547
01:24:25,486 --> 01:24:26,885
- Second time. - You said chasing waterfalls,

1548
01:24:26,987 --> 01:24:28,147
<i>now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.</i>

1549
01:24:28,222 --> 01:24:30,019
<i>- I don't even understand the reference. - It's like a tic.</i>

1550
01:24:30,091 --> 01:24:31,217
<i>I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

1551
01:24:31,325 --> 01:24:33,589
Remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.

1552
01:24:34,028 --> 01:24:35,723
- You can trust us. - Real quiet.

1553
01:24:35,830 --> 01:24:38,094
You gotta creep. Creep.

1554
01:24:38,366 --> 01:24:39,663
Come on.

1555
01:24:40,601 --> 01:24:43,092
<i>You don't say "Creep-creep" unless you're quoting TLC.</i>

1556
01:24:43,371 --> 01:24:44,736
Hey, guys.

1557
01:24:45,706 --> 01:24:47,571
You know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?

1558
01:24:48,242 --> 01:24:50,039
<i>Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.</i>

1559
01:24:50,111 --> 01:24:52,011
<i>I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?</i>

1560
01:24:52,346 --> 01:24:55,509
<i>Not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.</i>

1561
01:24:56,951 --> 01:24:58,509
You ready?

1562
01:24:58,586 --> 01:25:00,247
<i>- Yeah. - Let's go.</i>

1563
01:25:08,763 --> 01:25:11,129
- No, but the highlights are great. - Thank you.

1564
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:13,291
- Sexy but serious. - Thank you.

1565
01:25:13,401 --> 01:25:14,766
Excuse me.

1566
01:25:15,770 --> 01:25:18,432
Who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.

1567
01:25:18,539 --> 01:25:23,033
<i>You know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.</i>

1568
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,202
Who are they?

1569
01:25:25,713 --> 01:25:30,412
Well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.

1570
01:25:30,484 --> 01:25:36,320
And the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.

1571
01:25:36,424 --> 01:25:38,619
You owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?

1572
01:25:38,726 --> 01:25:40,216
Yes. Yes, I do.

1573
01:25:40,294 --> 01:25:43,457
<i>- You're a piece of work. - Thank you.</i>

1574
01:25:43,631 --> 01:25:46,998
Probably best to get started.

1575
01:25:47,435 --> 01:25:50,893
<i>This is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.</i>

1576
01:25:50,971 --> 01:25:53,906
<i>The only thing that bugs me is we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.</i>

1577
01:25:53,974 --> 01:25:58,070
- Is it the lotto? Who is it? - Who cares? Some rich prick.

1578
01:25:58,145 --> 01:26:04,106
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.

1579
01:26:04,185 --> 01:26:06,653
And I can assure you that every dime of your money

1580
01:26:06,754 --> 01:26:09,780
will be invested with the utmost diligence.

1581
01:26:09,857 --> 01:26:11,825
Your rates of return are really exciting.

1582
01:26:11,926 --> 01:26:13,450
We think our members are gonna be just thrilled.

1583
01:26:13,527 --> 01:26:17,361
<i>Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.</i>

1584
01:26:18,466 --> 01:26:20,661
All right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.

1585
01:26:20,768 --> 01:26:22,998
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.

1586
01:26:23,103 --> 01:26:24,161
Beautiful.

1587
01:26:24,271 --> 01:26:25,670
All right, listen up.

1588
01:26:25,773 --> 01:26:28,674
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.

1589
01:26:28,776 --> 01:26:30,937
We need your cooperation.

1590
01:26:31,011 --> 01:26:32,478
David Ershon.

1591
01:26:32,546 --> 01:26:34,878
<i>You're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement,</i>

1592
01:26:34,982 --> 01:26:36,677
and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.

1593
01:26:37,184 --> 01:26:38,617
This is a bad idea.

1594
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:40,484
Hey, guys.

1595
01:26:42,056 --> 01:26:44,524
Bob? What are you doing here?

1596
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:46,323
<i>I'm investing.</i>

1597
01:26:46,393 --> 01:26:48,827
Do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?

1598
01:26:48,896 --> 01:26:50,523
- This is what it was for. - Holy shit.

1599
01:26:50,631 --> 01:26:53,156
<i>It's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.</i>

1600
01:26:53,234 --> 01:26:57,466
<i>Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.</i>

1601
01:27:03,811 --> 01:27:07,440
<i>Gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.</i>

1602
01:27:08,349 --> 01:27:09,816
We are within our rights to take action.

1603
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:10,005
So much for quiet as church mice!

1604
01:28:10,578 --> 01:28:11,670
Go!

1605
01:28:16,817 --> 01:28:18,182
Who the hell are those guys?

1606
01:28:18,252 --> 01:28:21,312
<i>Gentlemen, I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.</i>

1607
01:28:21,388 --> 01:28:25,347
<i>Even I admit that's not very tempting, but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!</i>

1608
01:28:25,426 --> 01:28:27,394
- Get in the front! - How do you start this freaking thing?

1609
01:28:27,661 --> 01:28:28,650
Go on! Go!

1610
01:28:29,396 --> 01:28:30,385
- Shit! - Go!

1611
01:28:32,866 --> 01:28:33,855
Oh, my...

1612
01:28:35,269 --> 01:28:38,136
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!

1613
01:29:24,718 --> 01:29:25,707
Hold the wheel!

1614
01:29:31,425 --> 01:29:33,791
- Open the back! - I got it. I got it!

1615
01:29:41,802 --> 01:29:44,737
<i>They're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.</i>

1616
01:29:44,838 --> 01:29:47,238
<i>- Well, I'm gonna kill you first! - And then they will kill me.</i>

1617
01:29:47,341 --> 01:29:50,367
<i>We have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous,</i>

1618
01:29:50,477 --> 01:29:52,138
<i>- and holding David Ershon hostage. - Stupid pricks!</i>

1619
01:29:52,212 --> 01:29:55,704
<i>- It's us, we're good guys! - Exactly. They're the good guys.</i>

1620
01:29:55,816 --> 01:29:57,977
Where do we go? Where do we go?

1621
01:29:58,052 --> 01:30:00,714
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.

1622
01:30:00,821 --> 01:30:03,517
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.

1623
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:05,683
Not at the same time. That would be wrong.

1624
01:30:08,929 --> 01:30:11,625
<i>Let's hear it from the top, every detail.</i>

1625
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:16,829
I think the best way to tell the story is by starting at the end, briefly,

1626
01:30:16,904 --> 01:30:21,898
then going back to the beginning, and then periodically returning to the end,

1627
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:25,069
<i>maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.</i>

1628
01:30:25,179 --> 01:30:28,478
<i>Just to give it a bit of dynamism, otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.</i>

1629
01:30:28,549 --> 01:30:29,709
Just tell us what happened.

1630
01:30:29,817 --> 01:30:32,547
I lost a bunch of money from some people and now they want it back.

1631
01:30:32,886 --> 01:30:34,183
What about Don Beaman?

1632
01:30:34,254 --> 01:30:36,745
Beaman knew that I had falsified my financials,

1633
01:30:36,857 --> 01:30:39,155
so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.

1634
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:41,725
He forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin

1635
01:30:41,829 --> 01:30:43,854
and then forced him onto the ledge.

1636
01:30:43,931 --> 01:30:45,660
It was only a matter of time before he fell.

1637
01:30:45,733 --> 01:30:49,169
At least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.

1638
01:30:49,236 --> 01:30:52,501
<i>Well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.</i>

1639
01:30:52,573 --> 01:30:55,167
By 9:00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund

1640
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:57,938
<i>and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.</i>

1641
01:30:58,045 --> 01:30:59,569
<i>By 9:01, it's gone.</i>

1642
01:30:59,680 --> 01:31:02,672
<i>- Well, what if we stop the transfer? - But you can't. I mean, there's a...</i>

1643
01:31:02,750 --> 01:31:05,218
What if we stop the transfer?

1644
01:31:05,285 --> 01:31:08,186
<i>You'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9:00 exactly,</i>

1645
01:31:08,255 --> 01:31:10,723
find the clerk, get the routing number.

1646
01:31:10,791 --> 01:31:11,849
We gotta stop it.

1647
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,119
<i>There's no way.</i>

1648
01:31:13,227 --> 01:31:16,856
<i>Every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, they'll all be after us.</i>

1649
01:31:16,930 --> 01:31:21,026
<i>You could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.</i>

1650
01:31:21,635 --> 01:31:24,695
<i>- It's not a bribe. - Of course it's a bribe.</i>

1651
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:26,899
<i>You're offering to pay us money to not do our job.</i>

1652
01:31:28,976 --> 01:31:30,238
<i>It's not a bribe.</i>

1653
01:31:30,878 --> 01:31:33,278
We hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.

1654
01:31:33,380 --> 01:31:35,109
<i>We'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.</i>

1655
01:31:35,883 --> 01:31:37,407
First things first, I gotta go see Sheila.

1656
01:31:37,484 --> 01:31:38,883
<i>No way, it's too dangerous.</i>

1657
01:31:38,986 --> 01:31:41,284
<i>Look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow,</i>

1658
01:31:41,388 --> 01:31:44,915
but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.

1659
01:31:45,425 --> 01:31:47,325
All right, go. Go. Be careful.

1660
01:31:47,795 --> 01:31:49,422
Thanks, I will.

1661
01:31:50,264 --> 01:31:51,492
Will you say hi to Sheila for me?

1662
01:31:51,665 --> 01:31:53,428
- Okay. - Okay.

1663
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:56,469
Tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.

1664
01:31:56,570 --> 01:31:58,003
He wants to make sure you know

1665
01:31:58,105 --> 01:32:00,471
<i>that he'll be there for you if anything happens.</i>

1666
01:32:00,574 --> 01:32:02,633
<i>- Yeah. - Drop of a hat, I'm there.</i>

1667
01:32:02,843 --> 01:32:04,834
<i>Look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.</i>

1668
01:32:04,945 --> 01:32:07,846
If something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.

1669
01:32:07,948 --> 01:32:10,849
All of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.

1670
01:32:10,951 --> 01:32:13,112
<i>Why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?</i>

1671
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:14,685
Just go, man.

1672
01:32:15,422 --> 01:32:16,912
Okay. Thanks.

1673
01:32:17,858 --> 01:32:18,950
Go.

1674
01:32:22,930 --> 01:32:24,090
Janeco Gallery.

1675
01:32:25,032 --> 01:32:27,125
<i>Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.</i>

1676
01:32:37,845 --> 01:32:39,005
Please pick up.

1677
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,040
Hello.

1678
01:32:41,148 --> 01:32:44,311
<i>Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.</i>

1679
01:32:44,384 --> 01:32:47,649
<i>You know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.</i>

1680
01:32:47,888 --> 01:32:50,379
Baby, where are you? I wanna see you.

1681
01:32:50,490 --> 01:32:52,651
<i>I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.</i>

1682
01:32:52,726 --> 01:32:53,784
Do you remember?

1683
01:32:54,728 --> 01:32:56,127
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1684
01:32:56,196 --> 01:32:59,825
<i>I'm just warning you, though. Watch out. I think they're watching the house.</i>

1685
01:32:59,900 --> 01:33:02,494
<i>Don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.</i>

1686
01:33:03,036 --> 01:33:06,972
<i>I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...</i>

1687
01:33:08,141 --> 01:33:11,577
After all those years, after the restraining order.

1688
01:33:11,678 --> 01:33:15,045
I was worried I might not see you again.

1689
01:33:15,148 --> 01:33:16,740
<i>There's some very dangerous people after him,</i>

1690
01:33:16,850 --> 01:33:17,874
<i>and now they're after us.</i>

1691
01:33:21,088 --> 01:33:22,487
<i>It's just the old lady.</i>

1692
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:29,494
Hello, Allen.

1693
01:33:29,563 --> 01:33:32,157
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?

1694
01:33:32,232 --> 01:33:35,326
<i>Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.</i>

1695
01:33:36,670 --> 01:33:38,535
- She also says... - Yes.

1696
01:33:38,605 --> 01:33:42,439
...she wants you on top of her, holding her hair,

1697
01:33:42,542 --> 01:33:44,567
and riding her like a bucking bronco

1698
01:33:45,212 --> 01:33:48,841
<i>while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey."</i>

1699
01:33:49,683 --> 01:33:51,241
You, you tell your daughter...

1700
01:33:51,618 --> 01:33:54,052
<i>He said he'll always love you.</i>

1701
01:33:54,121 --> 01:33:56,783
<i>And he's so happy that you're having his child.</i>

1702
01:33:56,890 --> 01:33:58,050
Allen.

1703
01:33:58,125 --> 01:33:59,956
He also says that

1704
01:34:00,060 --> 01:34:04,087
<i>he wants you to stare into each other's eyes without blinking while you do it.</i>

1705
01:34:04,731 --> 01:34:07,256
- I love when we do that, Mom. - And then afterward,

1706
01:34:07,334 --> 01:34:09,302
lick the sex off each other.

1707
01:34:11,171 --> 01:34:13,071
<i>I don't wanna do this.</i>

1708
01:34:14,474 --> 01:34:17,875
- You say things that are too personal. - Okay, but just one more thing.

1709
01:34:18,211 --> 01:34:20,145
She said she loves you,

1710
01:34:20,213 --> 01:34:23,307
and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.

1711
01:34:23,984 --> 01:34:26,509
<i>Come on. That's not all she said.</i>

1712
01:34:26,987 --> 01:34:28,181
No.

1713
01:34:29,256 --> 01:34:32,851
<i>- She says other things, but I don't want... - Please, please, please.</i>

1714
01:34:32,926 --> 01:34:35,190
<i>You don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.</i>

1715
01:34:35,662 --> 01:34:36,856
Okay.

1716
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:44,268
She says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones

1717
01:34:44,338 --> 01:34:47,569
<i>- and have a three-day F marathon. - That's more like it. Yeah.</i>

1718
01:34:47,874 --> 01:34:53,005
<i>She wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.</i>

1719
01:34:53,080 --> 01:34:54,308
<i>That's just lovely.</i>

1720
01:34:54,715 --> 01:34:58,344
<i>No more! He says things I can't say.</i>

1721
01:34:58,418 --> 01:35:04,186
It involves a mannequin hand and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.

1722
01:35:12,733 --> 01:35:13,791
<i>Now what'd she say?</i>

1723
01:35:16,269 --> 01:35:18,032
She says she loves you.

1724
01:35:24,277 --> 01:35:26,609
<i>I'm so sorry about everything.</i>

1725
01:35:29,750 --> 01:35:32,919
And I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.

1726
01:35:32,919 --> 01:35:35,888
<i>And the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that</i>

1727
01:35:37,557 --> 01:35:41,618
<i>I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning</i>

1728
01:35:41,728 --> 01:35:44,526
and intelligent and wonderful you are,

1729
01:35:45,399 --> 01:35:49,233
<i>- I'd just lose you. - Shut up, Allen. I love you.</i>

1730
01:35:49,736 --> 01:35:52,534
<i>We have a place that's safe. All right.</i>

1731
01:36:05,085 --> 01:36:06,313
<i>I'm gonna break your hip.</i>

1732
01:36:15,095 --> 01:36:17,393
<i>I'm about to do you grandpa-style.</i>

1733
01:36:32,813 --> 01:36:34,440
I brought some music.

1734
01:36:38,952 --> 01:36:40,943
<i>Not what I would've chosen, but screw it.</i>

1735
01:36:41,021 --> 01:36:44,286
<i>All right. Let's go, Monday morning, time to go to work.</i>

1736
01:36:44,357 --> 01:36:45,483
<i>Let's do it.</i>

1737
01:36:45,592 --> 01:36:47,321
- You want my gate code? - Shut up, man!

1738
01:36:54,868 --> 01:36:55,960
<i>That's Wesley!</i>

1739
01:37:07,013 --> 01:37:08,105
Yes!

1740
01:37:10,517 --> 01:37:13,042
<i>- Where'd you learn to drive like that? - Grand Theft Auto!</i>

1741
01:37:15,989 --> 01:37:17,217
<i>Shit, Allen, they're coming.</i>

1742
01:37:20,127 --> 01:37:22,687
- Oh, my God! - Shit.

1743
01:37:23,964 --> 01:37:25,659
- Do something, Allen! - Hold on, hold on.

1744
01:37:47,154 --> 01:37:48,951
<i>Someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.</i>

1745
01:37:50,724 --> 01:37:52,055
I did that!

1746
01:37:52,159 --> 01:37:53,820
- I did that! - Oh, my God!

1747
01:37:53,894 --> 01:37:56,192
<i>- That's what I'm talking about! - We jackknifed them!</i>

1748
01:37:56,263 --> 01:37:58,754
Did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.

1749
01:37:58,865 --> 01:38:02,426
<i>Gator turns vans upside-down like they're in a crazy washing machine!</i>

1750
01:38:02,536 --> 01:38:04,470
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

1751
01:38:05,038 --> 01:38:07,802
<i>It's a nickname I had in college. I used to run a dating service.</i>

1752
01:38:07,874 --> 01:38:11,071
- He was a pimp. - Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.

1753
01:38:11,211 --> 01:38:13,679
Is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?

1754
01:38:14,714 --> 01:38:15,840
My poor car.

1755
01:38:16,183 --> 01:38:18,651
Right now the streets are a bloodbath.

1756
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:21,846
<i>And, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here,</i>

1757
01:38:21,955 --> 01:38:23,946
10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.

1758
01:38:24,257 --> 01:38:27,317
Got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.

1759
01:38:27,427 --> 01:38:31,659
One, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.

1760
01:38:31,765 --> 01:38:33,995
<i>- It's a good tip. - Yeah. Two...</i>

1761
01:38:34,100 --> 01:38:35,397
<i>Gentlemen, we got a hot one.</i>

1762
01:38:35,468 --> 01:38:39,097
<i>Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.</i>

1763
01:38:39,172 --> 01:38:41,140
Yes! Gun, gun!

1764
01:38:41,241 --> 01:38:43,175
<i>Pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.</i>

1765
01:38:43,276 --> 01:38:44,903
There we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?

1766
01:38:44,978 --> 01:38:46,411
Good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?

1767
01:38:46,479 --> 01:38:47,946
I do!

1768
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,813
<i>All right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.</i>

1769
01:38:49,916 --> 01:38:51,110
<i>- Move! Let's go. - Come on!</i>

1770
01:39:01,661 --> 01:39:04,528
Cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.

1771
01:39:09,803 --> 01:39:11,168
Jesus!

1772
01:39:16,009 --> 01:39:18,807
<i>- Who are those guys? - They're Chechen investors.</i>

1773
01:39:18,878 --> 01:39:21,938
<i>We were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.</i>

1774
01:39:22,015 --> 01:39:23,607
Anyway, it went terribly wrong.

1775
01:39:26,786 --> 01:39:28,981
<i>I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!</i>

1776
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:31,048
Oh, no.

1777
01:39:32,459 --> 01:39:33,517
Damn it.

1778
01:39:37,397 --> 01:39:39,865
Watch your head. God, your hair is soft.

1779
01:39:39,966 --> 01:39:41,399
VO5 Hot Oil.

1780
01:39:44,738 --> 01:39:47,036
<i>You're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!</i>

1781
01:39:47,140 --> 01:39:48,232
<i>I'm not gonna wreck!</i>

1782
01:39:50,210 --> 01:39:51,973
<i>- I'm gonna wreck! You're right! - You want me to drive?</i>

1783
01:40:11,998 --> 01:40:14,660
- This was a very clever idea. - Yeah.

1784
01:40:26,746 --> 01:40:28,043
<i>They're gone.</i>

1785
01:40:29,449 --> 01:40:30,541
<i>Let's go.</i>

1786
01:40:42,862 --> 01:40:46,298
<i>They are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.</i>

1787
01:40:54,174 --> 01:40:55,402
- This is a shortcut. - Are you kidding me?

1788
01:40:55,475 --> 01:40:56,703
You cannot go down there.

1789
01:41:04,617 --> 01:41:06,107
What are you doing?

1790
01:41:12,325 --> 01:41:13,417
Hit him!

1791
01:41:21,134 --> 01:41:22,499
- Where are we? - Chelsea Pier.

1792
01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:30,067
What the hell?

1793
01:41:31,411 --> 01:41:32,469
Jesus!

1794
01:41:39,853 --> 01:41:41,684
Them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.

1795
01:41:42,455 --> 01:41:43,513
Go!

1796
01:41:48,661 --> 01:41:49,753
Come on!

1797
01:41:51,631 --> 01:41:53,189
<i>We're cops! Hit the chopper!</i>

1798
01:42:16,122 --> 01:42:18,989
This is Martin and Fosse, en route. Back off! This is our collar!

1799
01:42:20,827 --> 01:42:23,489
Set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!

1800
01:42:23,797 --> 01:42:24,855
Take the light!

1801
01:42:45,051 --> 01:42:46,575
Do not authorize that transfer.

1802
01:42:46,686 --> 01:42:48,244
This is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.

1803
01:42:48,354 --> 01:42:50,754
He will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.

1804
01:42:50,857 --> 01:42:53,485
- Tell him! - Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.

1805
01:42:53,560 --> 01:42:54,527
Approve it.

1806
01:42:56,095 --> 01:42:57,187
Now.

1807
01:42:57,263 --> 01:42:58,855
Do not touch anything!

1808
01:42:59,265 --> 01:43:01,529
<i>I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.</i>

1809
01:43:01,601 --> 01:43:04,035
<i>Not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.</i>

1810
01:43:04,103 --> 01:43:05,195
Yeah?

1811
01:43:06,573 --> 01:43:10,065
Thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

1812
01:43:10,176 --> 01:43:13,577
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.

1813
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:16,510
<i>They're at 30 million, and holding.</i>

1814
01:43:17,217 --> 01:43:19,185
<i>- Wait! Can't you let me... - Take him away.</i>

1815
01:43:19,752 --> 01:43:21,276
But computers.

1816
01:43:23,456 --> 01:43:26,857
What if, one day, they were in charge?

1817
01:43:28,428 --> 01:43:32,524
<i>Now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.</i>

1818
01:43:32,599 --> 01:43:34,692
<i>That's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.</i>

1819
01:43:34,767 --> 01:43:36,029
Now!

1820
01:43:43,076 --> 01:43:44,236
You just stood there!

1821
01:43:44,344 --> 01:43:47,108
<i>I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?</i>

1822
01:43:47,213 --> 01:43:49,078
- I knew what that meant. - Shut up.

1823
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:52,208
<i>You kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.</i>

1824
01:43:52,285 --> 01:43:54,378
<i>- Who's got the golden goose now, huh? - Yeah.</i>

1825
01:43:58,424 --> 01:44:00,016
Shit!

1826
01:44:00,693 --> 01:44:02,854
<i>He's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.</i>

1827
01:44:02,929 --> 01:44:04,794
He immediately called your bluff.

1828
01:44:04,898 --> 01:44:06,729
Get up. And kill the police.

1829
01:44:06,799 --> 01:44:08,266
I just wanna make sure I get it right.

1830
01:44:08,368 --> 01:44:11,769
Did you want this transfer approved or not approved?

1831
01:44:12,238 --> 01:44:14,604
<i>You, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.</i>

1832
01:44:16,142 --> 01:44:18,940
<i>Police, don't move! Drop your weapons!</i>

1833
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:21,980
Drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!

1834
01:44:22,048 --> 01:44:24,983
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.

1835
01:44:25,084 --> 01:44:27,848
- Police! Down on the ground! - Let me see your hands!

1836
01:44:35,662 --> 01:44:38,028
- Hey, hey, you okay? - Hey.

1837
01:44:38,932 --> 01:44:41,298
<i>Hey, Gene. Captain. I'm sorry.</i>

1838
01:44:41,601 --> 01:44:43,296
<i>- I'm sorry. - That's okay. Don't worry about it.</i>

1839
01:44:43,369 --> 01:44:44,768
<i>You can call me Gene when we're not in the office.</i>

1840
01:44:45,338 --> 01:44:47,465
Okay. Thanks for coming by.

1841
01:44:47,540 --> 01:44:49,633
Attaboy.

1842
01:44:49,709 --> 01:44:51,768
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.

1843
01:44:52,011 --> 01:44:54,605
<i>We're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!</i>

1844
01:44:55,348 --> 01:44:58,681
<i>No. No, no, no, no. I'm just resting. I'm just resting. I was just resting.</i>

1845
01:44:58,785 --> 01:45:00,946
<i>I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?</i>

1846
01:45:01,020 --> 01:45:02,544
- Are you all right? - Just resting.

1847
01:45:02,655 --> 01:45:04,054
Hey, let me tell you something.

1848
01:45:04,157 --> 01:45:06,990
<i>As far as paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.</i>

1849
01:45:07,327 --> 01:45:08,885
- You know why? - Why?

1850
01:45:08,995 --> 01:45:10,485
<i>Ain't too proud to beg.</i>

1851
01:45:11,130 --> 01:45:12,324
Come on.

1852
01:45:12,398 --> 01:45:14,229
<i>- What? - It's not funny anymore.</i>

1853
01:45:14,334 --> 01:45:16,859
<i>- I don't know what you're talking about. - TLC references.</i>

1854
01:45:16,970 --> 01:45:18,961
Still nothing. I swear to you.

1855
01:45:19,305 --> 01:45:24,641
<i>I'm gonna go over and check on Terry. I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.</i>

1856
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:27,509
<i>It was the king of the mutt cases,</i>

1857
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:30,708
<i>but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.</i>

1858
01:45:33,586 --> 01:45:36,714
<i>Within 24 hours of learning about Ershon's scheme</i>

1859
01:45:36,823 --> 01:45:38,848
<i>and Lendl's massive losses,</i>

1860
01:45:38,925 --> 01:45:41,655
<i>the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.</i>

1861
01:45:41,728 --> 01:45:46,256
<i>Lendl is in everything, and we're gonna go everywhere...</i>

1862
01:45:46,366 --> 01:45:47,697
<i>They were too big to fail.</i>

1863
01:45:48,267 --> 01:45:53,432
<i>Ershon now resides in Palomino Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.</i>

1864
01:45:53,539 --> 01:45:56,599
<i>He still invests. Currency's just different.</i>

1865
01:45:57,677 --> 01:46:00,077
<i>Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman murder</i>

1866
01:46:00,179 --> 01:46:03,979
<i>by security cam footage which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.</i>

1867
01:46:04,050 --> 01:46:05,881
<i>It only showed the back of their heads.</i>

1868
01:46:05,985 --> 01:46:10,081
<i>But Allen's Faceback app was able to get a match to their faces.</i>

1869
01:46:10,556 --> 01:46:12,421
<i>Terry married Francine.</i>

1870
01:46:12,525 --> 01:46:15,494
<i>He played harp at the reception and it was beautiful.</i>

1871
01:46:15,561 --> 01:46:17,085
<i>He had learned how to play it in the eighth grade</i>

1872
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:20,563
<i>to make fun of the fairy that lived up the street.</i>

1873
01:46:20,667 --> 01:46:24,159
<i>Terry asked Sheila to be his best man, but she declined.</i>

1874
01:46:24,437 --> 01:46:28,669
<i>Let's be honest, we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.</i>

1875
01:46:28,741 --> 01:46:29,969
<i>But guess what?</i>

1876
01:46:30,043 --> 01:46:33,535
<i>The people that do the real work, the ones that make the difference,</i>

1877
01:46:33,813 --> 01:46:36,805
<i>you don't see them on TV or on the front page.</i>

1878
01:46:37,450 --> 01:46:40,908
<i>I'm talking about the day-in, day-outers, the grinders.</i>

1879
01:46:41,054 --> 01:46:44,182
<i>Come on, man, you know who I'm talking about: The other guys.</i>

1880
01:46:44,257 --> 01:46:45,417
<i>- See? That's a no-go. - Hey, hey.</i>

1881
01:46:46,192 --> 01:46:48,183
You think you broke this Ershon case open?

1882
01:46:48,594 --> 01:46:49,822
You did nothing.

1883
01:46:50,229 --> 01:46:51,821
Corporate lobbyists are spending millions

1884
01:46:51,898 --> 01:46:54,162
to make sure guys like Ershon keep doing what they do.

1885
01:46:55,034 --> 01:46:56,023
Derek Jeter?

1886
01:46:57,437 --> 01:47:00,531
<i>Yeah, it's me. You were set up that night you shot me, Terry.</i>

1887
01:47:00,840 --> 01:47:03,638
- I told you! - They knew by putting someone like you

1888
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:06,679
with a quick trigger finger next to that door where I do my pre-game walk,

1889
01:47:06,846 --> 01:47:09,212
<i>it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.</i>

1890
01:47:09,749 --> 01:47:11,842
<i>Now, I've been doing my own investigation on the banking industry,</i>

1891
01:47:11,984 --> 01:47:14,043
and I was close. I was real close.

1892
01:47:14,454 --> 01:47:15,614
So I forgive you, Terry.

1893
01:47:16,189 --> 01:47:18,282
<i>I appreciate that, man. I'm sorry about what happened.</i>

1894
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:20,047
<i>I'm glad you're doing better.</i>

1895
01:47:20,526 --> 01:47:22,824
The whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.

1896
01:47:23,429 --> 01:47:26,660
<i>And the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?</i>

1897
01:47:26,833 --> 01:47:29,267
The same corporations that own the government.

1898
01:47:29,869 --> 01:47:31,564
Courts and the law is all we have left.

1899
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:34,338
<i>So here's you guys' next case.</i>

1900
01:47:35,475 --> 01:47:38,376
Guy by the name of Carl Bachand, CEO of Killister Bank.

1901
01:47:39,011 --> 01:47:42,845
<i>He took three billion in TARP funds. He's crooked. He's real crooked.</i>

1902
01:47:43,382 --> 01:47:47,978
<i>Take him down, but be careful. He's got Blackwater mercenaries 24l7.</i>

1903
01:47:49,021 --> 01:47:50,181
Thanks, Derek.

1904
01:47:51,491 --> 01:47:53,618
Hey, Derek! Wait! What if we need to get in touch with you,

1905
01:47:53,693 --> 01:47:56,059
get some more information or some tickets or something?

1906
01:47:56,796 --> 01:47:57,956
What just happened?

1907
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,894
Goldman Sachs. This case is gonna be nasty.

1908
01:48:06,572 --> 01:48:08,267
Hi. Cute glasses.

1909
01:48:09,275 --> 01:48:11,243
- What was that? - What?

1910
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:14,939
<i>What? Dude, what is it with you and hot ladies? What's your secret?</i>

1911
01:48:15,014 --> 01:48:17,676
<i>Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.</i>

1912
01:48:17,784 --> 01:48:19,809
Tell me who you lost your virginity to.

1913
01:48:19,919 --> 01:48:22,945
She actually became a TV actress. Heather Locklear.

1914
01:48:23,022 --> 01:48:24,683
Heather Locklear, what?

1915
01:48:24,791 --> 01:48:26,418
<i>- You've heard of her? - Come on!</i>

1916
01:48:26,492 --> 01:48:30,292
<i>- She was much chubbier back then. - I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.</i>

1917
01:53:31,197 --> 01:53:32,858
<i>That was you. You don't have a sense of humor.</i>

1918
01:53:32,965 --> 01:53:34,432
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.

1919
01:53:34,934 --> 01:53:36,492
<i>If you say something funny, I'll laugh.</i>

1920
01:53:36,569 --> 01:53:39,265
<i>- All right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke. - Please. I love jokes.</i>

1921
01:53:39,405 --> 01:53:41,965
All right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.

1922
01:53:43,375 --> 01:53:46,503
<i>- It's time to get laid. - Already feels inappropriate.</i>

1923
01:53:46,812 --> 01:53:48,575
<i>So he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, "Miss,</i>

1924
01:53:48,948 --> 01:53:52,111
<i>"look, I know usually you want money, but I don't have any money and it's my birthday.</i>

1925
01:53:52,451 --> 01:53:54,214
<i>"Do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?"</i>

1926
01:53:54,753 --> 01:53:56,948
- Was he a farmer? - No.

1927
01:53:57,156 --> 01:54:01,456
<i>That's probably a Health Code violation, bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.</i>

1928
01:54:01,894 --> 01:54:03,452
<i>They weren't gonna have sex with the duck!</i>

1929
01:54:03,729 --> 01:54:05,492
No, I just mean Health Code violation

1930
01:54:05,564 --> 01:54:09,159
to have the duck brought into a facility like that.

1931
01:54:10,669 --> 01:54:12,830
<i>So, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it."</i>

1932
01:54:13,372 --> 01:54:15,806
So he goes in there, gives it to her.

1933
01:54:16,375 --> 01:54:19,538
- He gives her what? - The high, hard one! She loves it.

1934
01:54:19,812 --> 01:54:22,804
<i>She goes, "You know what? If you do that again, I'll give you your duck back."</i>

1935
01:54:23,149 --> 01:54:25,083
<i>- It's like getting laid twice for free. - So... I'm sorry.</i>

1936
01:54:25,151 --> 01:54:26,277
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1937
01:54:26,585 --> 01:54:30,521
- The duck is payment for sexual intercourse. - Yes. Yes.

1938
01:54:30,689 --> 01:54:31,849
- Very good. - He used the duck as payment,

1939
01:54:31,924 --> 01:54:33,516
<i>and now he's being paid back the duck.</i>

1940
01:54:33,959 --> 01:54:37,053
<i>He goes, "Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever." He does it again.</i>

1941
01:54:37,363 --> 01:54:40,924
<i>- Now he's walking home, right? Walking... - So she was satisfied with duck.</i>

1942
01:54:41,233 --> 01:54:43,224
- With a duck as currency... - Yes.

1943
01:54:43,302 --> 01:54:45,770
...to her. Great. Good.

1944
01:54:46,105 --> 01:54:49,836
<i>So he's walking home, now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?</i>

1945
01:54:50,209 --> 01:54:52,370
<i>He's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom,</i>

1946
01:54:52,444 --> 01:54:53,843
truck comes by and runs over his duck.

1947
01:54:53,946 --> 01:54:55,345
- Kills the duck? - Killed the duck.

1948
01:54:55,414 --> 01:54:57,575
- So the duck is now dead. - The duck is dead.

1949
01:54:58,050 --> 01:55:01,349
<i>The kid starts crying, truck driver stops, he's all upset, he didn't mean...</i>

1950
01:55:01,520 --> 01:55:04,648
<i>Of course he's crying! He's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice,</i>

1951
01:55:04,823 --> 01:55:08,281
- and he watched his beloved duck die. - Will you shut up and let me tell the story?

1952
01:55:08,460 --> 01:55:10,360
<i>So far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.</i>

1953
01:55:10,663 --> 01:55:13,131
The guy feels so bad about killing the duck, he gives him two dollars.

1954
01:55:13,499 --> 01:55:14,830
<i>And the kid's happy with the two bucks?</i>

1955
01:55:15,334 --> 01:55:18,792
<i>He's ecstatic! He got laid twice, and now he's got two dollars on top of it.</i>

1956
01:55:18,871 --> 01:55:21,339
Seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.

1957
01:55:22,508 --> 01:55:24,032
<i>This was a while back. You what I'm...</i>

1958
01:55:24,443 --> 01:55:26,934
<i>So he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?</i>

1959
01:55:27,012 --> 01:55:30,470
<i>"Tell me! Tell me!" He goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck,</i>

1960
01:55:30,616 --> 01:55:32,140
<i>"I got a duck for the fuck,</i>

1961
01:55:32,218 --> 01:55:33,981
<i>"and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!"</i>

1962
01:55:37,056 --> 01:55:38,284
<i>So it's like a limerick.</i>

1963
01:55:39,491 --> 01:55:40,719
<i>You didn't think that was funny?</i>

1964
01:55:41,193 --> 01:55:43,058
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure,

1965
01:55:43,762 --> 01:55:45,525
the way all the words were put together,

1966
01:55:45,598 --> 01:55:47,156
but in terms of content?

1967
01:55:48,801 --> 01:55:49,893
No.

1968
01:55:53,105 --> 01:55:56,734
<i>Get the check-check from Shen-Shen. Let's get out of here.</i>

1969
01:56:01,947 --> 01:56:06,145
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

1970
01:56:06,619 --> 01:56:07,643
And cut.
