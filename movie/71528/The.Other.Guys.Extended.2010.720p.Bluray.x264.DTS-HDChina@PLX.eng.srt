1
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:51,919
In New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.

2
00:00:52,021 --> 00:00:54,785
On that line live Danson and Highsmith.

3
00:00:58,027 --> 00:01:00,518
Tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!

4
00:01:01,464 --> 00:01:04,900
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.

5
00:01:21,084 --> 00:01:22,210
Get rid of that asshole.

6
00:01:22,285 --> 00:01:24,253
Uh-oh!        I hate it when you say "uh-oh!"

7
00:01:34,797 --> 00:01:36,931
Dude, you put a ding in my hood!

8
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:41,828
Come on with it, then!

9
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,450
That's trouble.

10
00:02:12,135 --> 00:02:15,743
Did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?

11
00:02:25,948 --> 00:02:27,848
That's it. I'm sick of all this running.

12
00:02:35,758 --> 00:02:36,850
Hang on!

13
00:02:47,337 --> 00:02:53,242
You have the right to remain silent!

14
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:56,370
But I wanna hear you scream!

15
00:03:11,861 --> 00:03:12,953
Down on the ground!

16
00:03:13,262 --> 00:03:15,457
Detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!

17
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,191
One at a time, all right?

18
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:20,126
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,

19
00:03:20,127 --> 00:03:22,448
 New York Observer Online.

20
00:03:22,705 --> 00:03:25,606
These suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana,

21
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,107
a misdemeanor in some states.

22
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:30,645
Do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?

23
00:03:30,646 --> 00:03:33,877
Why don't we let New York City answer that question?

24
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,441
The greatest city on Earth, yeah!

25
00:03:39,622 --> 00:03:42,989
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.

26
00:03:43,092 --> 00:03:46,653
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?

27
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:48,321
No comment.

28
00:03:48,798 --> 00:03:50,163
But, yes.

29
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:55,226
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!

30
00:03:58,674 --> 00:04:02,838
No drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.

31
00:04:03,179 --> 00:04:07,380
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style.

32
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:08,641
 They're rock stars.

33
00:04:08,751 --> 00:04:11,743
Then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets...

34
00:04:12,855 --> 00:04:14,755
...and the other guys.

35
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,686
We know, we know. We know.

36
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:22,958
All right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!

37
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:26,593
We're having a celebration tonight at Butter.

38
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,263
Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.

39
00:04:29,338 --> 00:04:32,136
That little short bitch from Jersey Shore.        Yeah!

40
00:04:32,208 --> 00:04:35,702
And most of you are on the list.

41
00:04:35,703 --> 00:04:37,312
You're the best.

42
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,348
Guys, I'm gonna say something right now.

43
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:41,815
It's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.

44
00:04:41,884 --> 00:04:44,717
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        Let me finish.

45
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:47,187
He became a champion and then a movie star, all right?

46
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,451
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        God damn it, let me...

47
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,459
They ruined the story. They ruined the story.

48
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:53,154
Let...What...The point is,

49
00:04:53,229 --> 00:04:54,871
we couldn't do our job

50
00:04:54,872 --> 00:04:56,324
if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork,

51
00:04:56,399 --> 00:04:58,697
answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do.

52
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,792
all the gun fights all the car chases

53
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,738
all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to,

54
00:05:04,841 --> 00:05:08,504
all due to what you guys do. Thank you.

55
00:05:08,578 --> 00:05:09,840
And we'd do it again and again.

56
00:05:09,912 --> 00:05:12,210
Hey, you shut your face!

57
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:13,509
If we wanna hear you talk,

58
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:16,484
I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!

59
00:05:16,686 --> 00:05:18,244
You hear me? You hear me?

60
00:05:18,821 --> 00:05:20,721
Cash bar.        Yeah.

61
00:05:20,823 --> 00:05:22,654
Peace out, bitches.

62
00:05:24,026 --> 00:05:26,995
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.

63
00:05:27,063 --> 00:05:28,553
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

64
00:05:28,831 --> 00:05:30,822
All right, right there.

65
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,868
Just back up, just like right there.

66
00:05:33,503 --> 00:05:35,562
All right, just one...Just a...

67
00:05:35,671 --> 00:05:37,400
There you go, right there. Right there.

68
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:40,066
This is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.

69
00:05:40,176 --> 00:05:43,373
That's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.

70
00:05:43,446 --> 00:05:47,109
It's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.

71
00:05:47,216 --> 00:05:48,615
No offense, Bob.        That's all right.

72
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,845
Anyway, now who wants it?        I do!

73
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,882
All right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!

74
00:05:54,357 --> 00:05:56,176
Nice work. Thanks, Allen.        Thank you, Captain.

75
00:05:56,178 --> 00:05:57,120
"I'll do it! I'll do it!"

76
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,296
Stop humming that song!

77
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,131
I can hum if I want to.        No, I know you can.

78
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:14,470
I'm asking you to stop.

79
00:06:14,777 --> 00:06:16,802
Well, if you're asking, then I'll stop.        Thank you.

80
00:06:22,318 --> 00:06:23,910
Could you not smile like that?

81
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:26,602
Now you're asking me to mask my emotions 

82
00:06:26,603 --> 00:06:27,921
because of how it makes you feel.

83
00:06:27,924 --> 00:06:29,721
That I will not do.

84
00:06:33,563 --> 00:06:36,396
Seriously, stop humming! Okay?

85
00:06:36,465 --> 00:06:38,490
This isn't accounting or wherever the hell

86
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,934
you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.

87
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,273
Forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.

88
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:46,014
Yeah, whatever. 

89
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,136
Stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.

90
00:06:49,245 --> 00:06:51,110
Hey, guys. Reminder.

91
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,411
The police union picnic's coming up this weekend.

92
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:59,113
My wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.

93
00:06:59,188 --> 00:07:00,587
It's a bad time, Bob!

94
00:07:01,023 --> 00:07:03,685
All right.

95
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,352
Going to get a slice.

96
00:07:17,006 --> 00:07:18,803
You know what I just did?

97
00:07:18,874 --> 00:07:21,172
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives,

98
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:23,768
and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back,

99
00:07:23,846 --> 00:07:26,041
but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me

100
00:07:26,148 --> 00:07:28,776
that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.

101
00:07:28,851 --> 00:07:30,045
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

102
00:07:30,152 --> 00:07:31,949
Good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.

103
00:07:32,021 --> 00:07:34,785
No. You don't have to.        No, I don't like you.

104
00:07:34,857 --> 00:07:36,290
I think you're a fake cop.

105
00:07:36,359 --> 00:07:40,125
The sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.

106
00:07:40,196 --> 00:07:42,960
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

107
00:07:43,032 --> 00:07:44,840
Even if you weren't in my food chain, 

108
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:47,732
I would go out of my way to attack you.

109
00:07:47,837 --> 00:07:49,395
If I were a lion, and you were a tuna,

110
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:52,099
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!

111
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,567
And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

112
00:07:55,678 --> 00:08:00,412
Okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?

113
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,426
Lions don't like water.

114
00:08:01,717 --> 00:08:04,884
If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source,

115
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:05,720
 that'd make sense.

116
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,053
But you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,

117
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,887
I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa,

118
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,499
coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna 

119
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,527
with his 20 or 30 friends?

120
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:16,758
You lose that battle.

121
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:19,767
You lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?

122
00:08:19,869 --> 00:08:22,228
You've wandered into our school of tuna,

123
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,136
 and we now have a taste of lion.

124
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,640
We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.

125
00:08:26,742 --> 00:08:27,902
Yeah?        And said, " You know what?

126
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:31,140
"Lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion. "

127
00:08:31,247 --> 00:08:33,807
We've developed a system to establish a beachhead

128
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,817
and aggressively hunt you and your family.

129
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,080
And we will corner your pride,

130
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:41,055
your children, your offspring.        How you gonna do that?

131
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:44,918
We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.

132
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:47,285
We will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.

133
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,036
It's not gonna be days at a time, 

134
00:08:49,174 --> 00:08:52,174
but an hour, hour 45, no problem.

135
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:54,596
That will give us enough time to figure out where you live,

136
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:58,064
go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.

137
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:01,732
You just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and outmanned.

138
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:07,408
Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?

139
00:09:07,483 --> 00:09:08,609
Nope.

140
00:09:16,192 --> 00:09:17,784
Two minutes before the markets open,

141
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,161
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global, 

142
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:21,310
ringing the opening bell.

143
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,798
With Boardman is investment banker, David Ershon,

144
00:09:23,866 --> 00:09:27,424
who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.

145
00:09:27,436 --> 00:09:30,269
How much did we lose?

146
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,137
You may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.

147
00:09:33,138 --> 00:09:35,101
$32.        Million?

148
00:09:35,102 --> 00:09:37,707
No, billion.

149
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:40,648
Shit!

150
00:09:41,417 --> 00:09:45,820
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.

151
00:09:45,988 --> 00:09:47,683
Bang, bang.        Yeah.

152
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,682
Then I raise up to take the leader out.

153
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:50,982
Shit, I feel like I'm there now.

154
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,755
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.

155
00:09:53,829 --> 00:09:55,660
He says, "Let's even the odds!"

156
00:09:55,965 --> 00:10:00,163
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.

157
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:02,727
Game over, bitches.

158
00:10:04,807 --> 00:10:06,502
All right.        Yeah.

159
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:12,606
Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.

160
00:10:12,681 --> 00:10:14,171
Like my cock was made out of concrete.

161
00:10:15,518 --> 00:10:17,418
I know it's very tempting.

162
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,681
You want to impress your friends.

163
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:22,246
But this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?

164
00:10:22,358 --> 00:10:26,029
This is firing your weapon in the line of duty.

165
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,119
Officer Hoitz?

166
00:10:27,563 --> 00:10:28,894
Oh, man.

167
00:10:28,964 --> 00:10:30,124
Come on!        Here we go.

168
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,598
Would you like to share?

169
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,826
No, I'd rather not.

170
00:10:33,169 --> 00:10:35,569
Officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now,

171
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,434
and you haven't said a word.

172
00:10:37,506 --> 00:10:39,872
This is a safe room, no judgment here.

173
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,034
Jerkoff.

174
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:43,408
That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

175
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,005
I relive it every night.

176
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:48,282
Bronx, October.

177
00:10:48,384 --> 00:10:50,181
Game 7 of the World Series.

178
00:10:50,252 --> 00:10:52,294
For all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, 

179
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:53,518
and I pulled tunnel duty.

180
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:56,722
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.

181
00:10:56,723 --> 00:10:58,425
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!

182
00:10:58,527 --> 00:10:59,858
Finally pulled my gun.

183
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:01,226
Pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.

184
00:11:01,297 --> 00:11:03,197
Don't make me shoot! I'll do it!

185
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:06,498
Are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?

186
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:09,530
You dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!

187
00:11:09,605 --> 00:11:12,369
You cost me 20 grand on that game!        Douche bag.

188
00:11:12,441 --> 00:11:13,908
Cost the city a championship.

189
00:11:13,976 --> 00:11:16,308
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.

190
00:11:16,545 --> 00:11:18,240
Now I'm stuck with a desk jockey partner. 

191
00:11:18,241 --> 00:11:19,576
Everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.

192
00:11:19,576 --> 00:11:21,042
Because you shot Derek Jeter!

193
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:22,413
He's a biracial angel.

194
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:24,145
You should've shot A-Rod.

195
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,125
Yo, Paper Bitch.

196
00:11:33,495 --> 00:11:35,156
What's up, man?        Hey. Hey, guys.

197
00:11:35,264 --> 00:11:36,959
Paper Bitch.        Paper Bitch.

198
00:11:37,066 --> 00:11:38,124
I don't like that, actually.

199
00:11:38,234 --> 00:11:39,997
I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.

200
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,660
Still working on the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?

201
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,829
Shit.        No, actually, actually, that's...

202
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:45,304
What is this? That looks stupid.

203
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:47,799
Guys, it's illegal permitting for construction. 

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,103
Specifically, scaffolding.

205
00:11:49,111 --> 00:11:50,635
Some of the guys were talking.

206
00:11:50,946 --> 00:11:52,241
They were like, " How come you've never 

207
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:53,964
fired your weapon in the office before?"

208
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:54,964
Good point.

209
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,381
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

210
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:57,918
You've never fired your weapon in the office.

211
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,147
We all have, you know. It's called a desk pop.

212
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:02,918
Fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.

213
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,151
Not true.        I'm not stupid.

214
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:06,694
I'm not gonna discharge my firearm in the office.

215
00:12:06,762 --> 00:12:08,354
Gamble, listen to me. I'll try to make it real clear.

216
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,973
We honor the flag, 

217
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:12,595
and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.

218
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:15,060
Jimmy. When's the last time you had a desk pop?

219
00:12:15,371 --> 00:12:16,797
September '08.

220
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,935
Be a man. Do it.        Now.

221
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,702
Please, please, do it.        Pop one off!

222
00:12:20,776 --> 00:12:22,869
There you go. Pop it off!        Don't think, just go!

223
00:12:22,945 --> 00:12:24,503
Here we go.        Do it, yes.

224
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,173
He did it!

225
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:29,114
Hey! Shots fired!

226
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:32,346
Hey, Terry, I did it! I did my first desk pop!

227
00:12:32,855 --> 00:12:34,413
It's a real thing, right?

228
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,013
A desk pop?        Yeah.

229
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:37,217
No, that's not real!

230
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:41,252
They were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.

231
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:46,097
All right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.

232
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:47,293
Yes, sir.

233
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,306
Captain, you really wanna disarm this guy,

234
00:12:49,307 --> 00:12:51,397
 take out the batteries in the calculator.

235
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:54,278
All right, I'm gonna give you this. This is a dummy gun.

236
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,550
 I use it for ceremony.

237
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:56,404
There.

238
00:12:57,446 --> 00:13:01,041
You get this back when I feel you know how to handle it.

239
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,313
Listen, guys. I'm working two jobs. I'm working here.

240
00:13:05,421 --> 00:13:08,584
And I got another job at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?

241
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,285
I'm doing that just to put a kid through NYU

242
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,126
so he can explore his bisexuality and become a deejay.

243
00:13:15,197 --> 00:13:18,655
Now the last thing I need is a ballistics report in the unit.

244
00:13:18,767 --> 00:13:21,133
I'm just gonna ask you guys, please, come on, really.

245
00:13:21,203 --> 00:13:22,966
Just think about...Just be smart.

246
00:13:52,501 --> 00:13:53,968
211 in progress.

247
00:13:54,036 --> 00:13:57,130
They're using a wrecking ball to clean out Castien Jewelry.

248
00:13:57,206 --> 00:13:58,639
All right, we got it.

249
00:13:58,707 --> 00:14:01,039
Good luck, guys. Have a good one.        Allen, let's go.

250
00:14:01,143 --> 00:14:04,010
No, I got work to do.        What? This is work!

251
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,674
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith. We roll in heavy.

252
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,081
You cream puffs, sit tight.

253
00:14:09,184 --> 00:14:10,515
You gotta be shitting me!

254
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,682
You can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?

255
00:14:13,756 --> 00:14:16,850
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!

256
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,227
Did he just...Did he just call himself a peacock?

257
00:14:28,771 --> 00:14:29,999
Let's go! Let's go!

258
00:14:33,042 --> 00:14:34,100
Come on, fellas!

259
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,743
Wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!

260
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:52,919
That's the second one this week!

261
00:14:53,562 --> 00:14:55,587
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!

262
00:14:56,265 --> 00:14:57,391
Let's go!

263
00:14:58,233 --> 00:14:59,291
Yeah!

264
00:14:59,868 --> 00:15:01,062
Heads up!

265
00:15:02,703 --> 00:15:03,477
Shit.

266
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,010
Special Forces zipline.

267
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,083
Cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!

268
00:15:21,323 --> 00:15:23,587
These guys are pros.        Let's go!

269
00:15:23,659 --> 00:15:25,058
You thinking what I'm thinking, partner?

270
00:15:25,661 --> 00:15:26,753
Aim for the bushes.

271
00:15:54,356 --> 00:15:58,019
Cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.

272
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:02,086
Maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.

273
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:04,325
Maybe their egos pushed them off.

274
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,129
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.

275
00:16:07,202 --> 00:16:10,337
Either way, there was a hole in New York City, 

276
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:11,936
and it needed to be filled.

277
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:14,305
Two days ago, this city wept.

278
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:18,335
We lost two heroes who gave everything for us,

279
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,614
who paid that ultimate sacrifice

280
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:24,051
 so that we may walk these streets safely.

281
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:25,844
There wasn't even an awning in their direction.

282
00:16:25,954 --> 00:16:28,115
No, I know.        They just jumped 20 stories.

283
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:29,521
Doesn't make sense, does it?

284
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:33,493
I only hope God lets them take their. 357s with them to heaven.

285
00:16:33,562 --> 00:16:34,833
It's our moment, Allen. 

286
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,896
Our moment to step up and be the guys.

287
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,061
We're at a funeral. Show some respect.        What?

288
00:16:40,369 --> 00:16:41,995
You don't think every other detective here

289
00:16:41,996 --> 00:16:43,251
 isn't thinking the same thing?

290
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,671
Allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.

291
00:16:48,672 --> 00:16:51,369
Their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.

292
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,007
That someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.

293
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,840
Is it?        Yeah.

294
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,548
What about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens,

295
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:02,385
all just stepping up and doing their part?

296
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,721
As a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?

297
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:06,987
I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.

298
00:17:07,062 --> 00:17:09,394
I went to school and made my bed.

299
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:12,092
And at age 11, I audited my parents.

300
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:15,500
And believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.

301
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:17,436
What the hell are you?

302
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,508
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

303
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:22,279
Look at these two jamokes, would you? 

304
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,673
One shot Jeter and the other shot an office.

305
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,680
Have some decorum. We're at a funeral.

306
00:17:30,752 --> 00:17:32,947
You wanna dance, brolio?

307
00:17:33,055 --> 00:17:35,863
I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks. 

308
00:17:35,864 --> 00:17:37,408
You'll be pissing blood out of your ass.

309
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,023
That's horrible.

310
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,720
Why don't you step back, man?

311
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,262
You touch him, I swear to God

312
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:43,264
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.

313
00:17:43,265 --> 00:17:46,090
He's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.

314
00:17:46,101 --> 00:17:47,898
You wanna go?        I wanna go!

315
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:50,469
Get him off.        Kick his ass, Martin.

316
00:17:51,106 --> 00:17:52,300
Yeah. How do you like that?

317
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:55,233
Pull his hair!        I love it.

318
00:17:55,444 --> 00:17:57,105
This hurts so good.

319
00:17:58,046 --> 00:18:00,607
Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.        What a lovely hat.

320
00:18:00,608 --> 00:18:01,840
I love your shoes.

321
00:18:02,417 --> 00:18:03,941
It's fine, it's fine.        Go, go.

322
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:05,712
Punish him!

323
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:07,812
Oh, man.

324
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,458
Do it. That's how we do it in the hood.

325
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,753
Punish him.        That's not even a move.

326
00:18:12,995 --> 00:18:15,293
I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.

327
00:18:15,397 --> 00:18:17,365
What the hell is going on here?

328
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,491
Two good men are dead,

329
00:18:19,568 --> 00:18:22,962
you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?

330
00:18:22,963 --> 00:18:23,964
Is that what's happening?

331
00:18:23,972 --> 00:18:25,796
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.

332
00:18:26,742 --> 00:18:28,232
Let me tell you something.

333
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,841
Sorry for your loss, Lorraine.        Very sorry.

334
00:18:30,846 --> 00:18:32,646
Sorry, Lorraine.        Sorry, Lorraine.

335
00:18:33,181 --> 00:18:34,478
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

336
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:37,345
Too soon?        Why'd you say that?

337
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,511
I'll tell you something about those guys.

338
00:18:40,555 --> 00:18:42,256
They knew that to become a good cop, 

339
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,585
you had to solve cases. Okay?

340
00:18:44,993 --> 00:18:48,258
Okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.

341
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:50,927
Okay? So just watch it.

342
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:54,101
Next time, me, you, library.

343
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:56,329
Not even close.        Come on, guys. Guys, come on.

344
00:18:57,072 --> 00:18:59,006
You are...        I'm the winner!

345
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:01,250
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay? 

346
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:02,674
I could've handled that myself.

347
00:19:02,709 --> 00:19:06,108
Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.

348
00:19:06,214 --> 00:19:07,442
Move.

349
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:20,021
9:15, let's have a great day, everybody!        Cut the shit!

350
00:19:26,635 --> 00:19:27,829
Good morning.

351
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:32,003
We've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.

352
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:34,208
There are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.

353
00:19:34,209 --> 00:19:35,702
Try to stay out of trouble, boys.

354
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,971
There's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?

355
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:38,876
No chance. Too busy.

356
00:19:39,147 --> 00:19:41,803
All right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?

357
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,699
 We're about to lock shit down.

358
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:45,776
That's right.        You girls stay here and get your type on.

359
00:19:45,787 --> 00:19:47,687
Go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.

360
00:19:47,688 --> 00:19:48,815
Shut up!

361
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,684
Allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?

362
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,193
I...I'm super busy right now, Terry.

363
00:19:53,261 --> 00:19:54,661
No, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.

364
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,595
It's about the construction permits you were talking about.

365
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,689
The scaffolding violations?        This is our thing, yeah.

366
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:01,893
So, what do you got?

367
00:20:02,003 --> 00:20:04,494
I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.

368
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:05,665
What are you doing?

369
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:08,437
Let's go. We're going to that call.

370
00:20:08,543 --> 00:20:10,401
What is this?        Shut up.

371
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:12,544
We're going to the car, and we're going after this case.

372
00:20:12,614 --> 00:20:14,407
You're not gonna shoot me.        I won't?

373
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,583
No.        I shot Jeter.

374
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,845
That was an accident.        Was it?

375
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,443
Now move.        Okay.

376
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:21,519
Hey.

377
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,787
Does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.

378
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,690
I'm being kidnapped.

379
00:20:26,762 --> 00:20:29,856
Really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?

380
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,835
So, then what happened?        What do you think happened?

381
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:34,652
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, 

382
00:20:34,653 --> 00:20:36,385
and I got in my car, and I got out of there.

383
00:20:36,286 --> 00:20:37,561
Talk about a wild weekend, right?

384
00:20:37,639 --> 00:20:40,938
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.

385
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:43,203
What are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.

386
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,445
What the hell is this?

387
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:50,245
It's my car. It's a Prius.

388
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:53,981
I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.

389
00:20:54,089 --> 00:20:56,922
Detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.

390
00:20:56,992 --> 00:20:59,085
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.

391
00:20:59,161 --> 00:21:00,890
We'll just see who's there first.

392
00:21:00,962 --> 00:21:03,658
You stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?

393
00:21:03,832 --> 00:21:05,390
Go, go, go!

394
00:21:05,801 --> 00:21:08,497
You feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?

395
00:21:08,603 --> 00:21:10,668
Big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?

396
00:21:10,669 --> 00:21:12,464
Are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?

397
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:14,299
I got something to get you going.

398
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:19,306
Let's go do some damage!

399
00:21:20,749 --> 00:21:21,977
Nope.

400
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:25,479
What the hell is that?

401
00:21:25,821 --> 00:21:28,448
LRB. Little River Band.

402
00:21:28,449 --> 00:21:30,622
This music makes me feel like I'm going shopping for a training bra.

403
00:21:30,959 --> 00:21:33,427
You know what? We go with no music, okay?

404
00:21:33,495 --> 00:21:34,621
Fine.        Say bye.

405
00:21:34,696 --> 00:21:35,822
No, no, no, don't say bye...

406
00:21:35,931 --> 00:21:37,626
You just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!

407
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:40,930
Allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!

408
00:21:41,002 --> 00:21:42,435
America!

409
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:45,035
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!

410
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:49,105
Seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!

411
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:49,969
Terry, I'm coming in.

412
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:51,876
You're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!

413
00:21:52,214 --> 00:21:53,647
Dude! What...

414
00:21:58,854 --> 00:22:00,981
That's a lot of cocaine.

415
00:22:01,957 --> 00:22:05,149
Did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?

416
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,823
Nope. No. No.

417
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,861
I've never actually put my foot all the way down

418
00:22:10,665 --> 00:22:12,962
to the ground with the accelerator like that.

419
00:22:15,036 --> 00:22:17,334
It got me slightly aroused.

420
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,467
Here we go.

421
00:22:23,545 --> 00:22:27,003
Way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.

422
00:22:27,082 --> 00:22:29,516
Prius, huh?        Yep, yep.

423
00:22:29,584 --> 00:22:30,846
Good mileage?

424
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:32,318
Outstanding.        Yeah.

425
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:34,981
Did this come with a dental dam?

426
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:37,590
No.        Get it?

427
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:41,062
My Suburban shit one of these last night.

428
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:43,096
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.

429
00:22:44,366 --> 00:22:45,526
We've had our fun, huh?

430
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,569
Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.

431
00:22:49,337 --> 00:22:50,429
All right, everybody!

432
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:53,565
I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.

433
00:22:53,675 --> 00:22:56,075
"At the crime scene, LOL."

434
00:22:56,177 --> 00:22:57,872
Good tweet, good tweet.        Yeah, thanks.

435
00:22:58,246 --> 00:23:02,412
America has always been defined by its excess.

436
00:23:03,218 --> 00:23:05,686
The Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.

437
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,188
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.

438
00:23:08,256 --> 00:23:12,424
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis

439
00:23:13,295 --> 00:23:15,229
and a Subaru station wagon.

440
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:18,431
And it's because of this excess that I have flourished.

441
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:22,128
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.

442
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:25,934
Live for excess. It's the American way.

443
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,777
Hello.

444
00:23:34,482 --> 00:23:37,645
Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.

445
00:23:41,089 --> 00:23:42,215
Sir David.

446
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,480
David. You're not returning my calls, 

447
00:23:44,481 --> 00:23:45,920
so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.

448
00:23:45,994 --> 00:23:47,621
G'day, mate.        Hey.

449
00:23:48,063 --> 00:23:50,327
Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you,

450
00:23:50,432 --> 00:23:52,054
because I think you're going to take off.

451
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:55,265
Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.

452
00:23:55,337 --> 00:23:58,161
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.

453
00:23:58,162 --> 00:23:59,463
You have until then to give me my money. 

454
00:23:59,464 --> 00:24:00,973
I'm not reporting any losses, David.

455
00:24:00,975 --> 00:24:02,986
I have zeroed in on a new investor.

456
00:24:02,987 --> 00:24:04,004
Well, then, you get their money,

457
00:24:04,005 --> 00:24:06,074
 make it disappear, and then pay us back.

458
00:24:06,074 --> 00:24:09,503
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.

459
00:24:09,504 --> 00:24:11,675
David!        Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.

460
00:24:11,786 --> 00:24:16,155
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.

461
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:17,683
Heard everything, mate.

462
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:19,051
Ladies and gentlemen,

463
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,654
guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.

464
00:24:25,567 --> 00:24:27,034
That man there.

465
00:24:27,836 --> 00:24:29,827
Go! Go!

466
00:24:30,138 --> 00:24:31,969
Side!        Step aside, please.

467
00:24:32,741 --> 00:24:34,504
You don't think I'm a real cop, do you?

468
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:36,840
No, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.

469
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,037
I was really honest about that.

470
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:40,637
I'm working on a huge case, all right?

471
00:24:40,715 --> 00:24:42,842
Property owner with seven buildings under construction.

472
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:46,045
He hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.

473
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:47,630
Now, according to Ask Jeeves, 

474
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:50,544
this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.

475
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,888
That's your big case? Scaffolding permits?        Yeah.

476
00:24:54,529 --> 00:24:57,225
Guess what? You're coming with me.

477
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,899
It's a wooden gun.

478
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,235
That hurts, man!

479
00:25:06,508 --> 00:25:08,849
I've always got Little River Band loaded up here. 

480
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,377
I've got six disks in here.

481
00:25:11,212 --> 00:25:14,675
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.

482
00:25:14,676 --> 00:25:16,917
I'm flying Air Singapore.

483
00:25:17,018 --> 00:25:18,713
Hey, Douglas. How's the wife?        She died.

484
00:25:18,787 --> 00:25:19,879
Attaboy!

485
00:25:19,954 --> 00:25:21,922
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.

486
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,885
Another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.

487
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:28,058
You're just mad because I have a nice change purse.

488
00:25:28,129 --> 00:25:29,255
Why do you even care?

489
00:25:29,364 --> 00:25:32,299
How can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?

490
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,425
The way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.

491
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:35,628
You're being ridiculous.

492
00:25:35,737 --> 00:25:38,297
They sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.

493
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,703
What?        Like a little...

494
00:25:39,774 --> 00:25:41,639
You know what bugs me about you?        What?

495
00:25:41,743 --> 00:25:43,274
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.

496
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,477
No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.

497
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:48,913
You're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.

498
00:25:48,983 --> 00:25:50,075
Get out of the way, man!

499
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:52,051
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

500
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,418
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...

501
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:58,755
Anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.

502
00:25:58,827 --> 00:26:02,092
Excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay?        What?

503
00:26:02,163 --> 00:26:07,100
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used

504
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:09,295
What's the next part?        As a floatation device.

505
00:26:09,404 --> 00:26:10,894
As a floatation device.

506
00:26:10,972 --> 00:26:14,799
You know what? That's very funny. I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.

507
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:16,406
Really?        Are you guys for real?

508
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:17,570
Am I being punk'd?

509
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:20,010
Detective Allen Gamble.

510
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,870
We are in a cocaine-covered car, 

511
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,297
and we are bringing in a perp.

512
00:26:23,298 --> 00:26:26,176
One David Ershon.        175 pounds.

513
00:26:26,177 --> 00:26:28,012
Thank you. 175 pounds.        Shut up, man, shut up!

514
00:26:28,256 --> 00:26:30,296
Martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B 

515
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,023
talking to Shepard Smith right now.

516
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,960
We arrest this jerkoff for a scaffolding permit?

517
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:37,331
Wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?

518
00:26:37,332 --> 00:26:39,197
For scaffolding permit violation...

519
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,109
I got my insurance card. Somewhere.        Easy, mate.

520
00:26:50,178 --> 00:26:52,544
What the hell? You ran right into us!        Stand over there.

521
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,172
Wood?

522
00:26:54,716 --> 00:26:55,842
What the...

523
00:26:55,950 --> 00:26:57,713
Couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate.        What?

524
00:26:57,819 --> 00:26:59,446
Do not let these men take me.

525
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:02,314
Hi.

526
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:04,948
Why's she looking at you like that?

527
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:06,516
That's my car!

528
00:27:06,628 --> 00:27:10,359
Hey, hey, hey! We didn't exchange insurance information!

529
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:12,290
Hey! Excuse me!

530
00:27:13,168 --> 00:27:15,568
Why did they take our shoes?

531
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:18,071
What the hell just happened?        Where's my iPhone?

532
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,368
I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.

533
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:25,599
I don't get why we can't just call the office 

534
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,506
and have a squad car come pick us up.

535
00:27:27,582 --> 00:27:30,173
No. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.

536
00:27:30,185 --> 00:27:32,162
There's no way that's going out on the radio.

537
00:27:32,187 --> 00:27:33,444
Look, if we're gonna do this together, 

538
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:35,316
there's some issues we need to settle, okay?

539
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:38,985
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.

540
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,254
How do you think that makes me feel?

541
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:43,424
I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.

542
00:27:45,533 --> 00:27:47,763
I hear you.

543
00:27:47,869 --> 00:27:50,702
Let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.

544
00:27:52,707 --> 00:27:55,335
All right. Fresh start.

545
00:27:57,045 --> 00:28:00,706
Maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers,

546
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,573
'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.

547
00:28:03,852 --> 00:28:04,910
Right?

548
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,415
Let's do another fresh start, 

549
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,088
'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.

550
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:10,951
Fine, fresh start.

551
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,856
It's the last one.

552
00:28:12,927 --> 00:28:15,561
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.

553
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:20,963
Okay, folks! Everybody, listen up!        Listen up!

554
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:22,569
Got a high profile kidnapping.

555
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,103
David Ershon, wealthy banker, multinational team.

556
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:28,232
Maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.

557
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:32,746
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.

558
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:34,805
Who cares? It's not important, okay?

559
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:37,741
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

560
00:28:39,387 --> 00:28:41,048
Bye, guys.        Bye-bye.

561
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:42,214
Come on.

562
00:28:42,657 --> 00:28:45,820
Guys, this is Don Beaman, the attorney for Mr. Ershon.

563
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:48,374
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

564
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:50,063
Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch!        Hey, hey, hey!

565
00:28:50,131 --> 00:28:51,894
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!

566
00:28:51,966 --> 00:28:53,552
That's the guy who took our guns, Captain.

567
00:28:53,553 --> 00:28:54,998
And my shoes!        Wait a minute, wait a minute. 

568
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,163
Did you identify yourselves as police officers?

569
00:28:57,188 --> 00:28:58,230
What is this?

570
00:28:58,306 --> 00:29:00,638
Allen, tell me. Did you?        No, we did not.

571
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:02,256
Sorry, gentlemen. 

572
00:29:02,736 --> 00:29:04,736
We thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.

573
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,440
It's only protocol.

574
00:29:06,648 --> 00:29:10,400
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation.

575
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,300
 The case is closed.

576
00:29:11,402 --> 00:29:13,843
I've taken care of all necessary paperwork.

577
00:29:13,955 --> 00:29:16,048
And you fellas, at this point, should just be glad that

578
00:29:16,157 --> 00:29:19,649
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.

579
00:29:19,727 --> 00:29:21,194
Thank you, Captain.        You bet.

580
00:29:21,729 --> 00:29:23,321
Australian?

581
00:29:23,398 --> 00:29:24,831
Special Forces, right?

582
00:29:25,199 --> 00:29:27,724
Best watch your step, Detective.

583
00:29:27,835 --> 00:29:30,531
There are three things I love in this world.

584
00:29:30,638 --> 00:29:31,696
Kylie Minogue,

585
00:29:33,308 --> 00:29:36,072
small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...

586
00:29:36,177 --> 00:29:37,542
Beautiful features.

587
00:29:37,645 --> 00:29:40,375
...and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.

588
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:45,009
Hey! Shake your dicks. This pissing contest is over.

589
00:29:45,086 --> 00:29:46,417
Come on, man.

590
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:52,084
All right, look, they returned your shoes.

591
00:29:52,527 --> 00:29:56,759
And they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.

592
00:29:58,366 --> 00:30:01,062
Allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it,

593
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:04,002
some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.

594
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:06,666
You might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.

595
00:30:06,741 --> 00:30:07,867
Okay.

596
00:30:07,942 --> 00:30:09,068
You're mad at us, huh, Gene?

597
00:30:09,177 --> 00:30:12,874
First off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.

598
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:15,891
Guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?

599
00:30:15,892 --> 00:30:16,742
Sure.        All right.

600
00:30:16,851 --> 00:30:19,445
Well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?

601
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:22,352
The opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.

602
00:30:22,423 --> 00:30:24,391
It's just "Captain. "

603
00:30:24,459 --> 00:30:27,519
Just "Captain. " It's not "Captain Gene. " I don't have a kiddie show.

604
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:29,222
That sounds creepy, "Captain Gene. "

605
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:33,691
Police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.

606
00:30:33,768 --> 00:30:36,703
Was he the victim of financial profiling?

607
00:30:36,771 --> 00:30:39,723
Financial profiling? That's crazy. 

608
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,471
He broke the law and we arrested him.

609
00:30:41,576 --> 00:30:45,637
That wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me. "

610
00:30:45,747 --> 00:30:48,447
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.

611
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,247
What about donkeys or deer?

612
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,287
They have hooves. What about bovine creatures?

613
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,416
Were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?

614
00:30:57,492 --> 00:31:00,461
Yeah.        Yeah. I could see it.

615
00:31:00,561 --> 00:31:03,020
Listen, why don't we just go over to my place?

616
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,391
We'll talk the case down.

617
00:31:04,392 --> 00:31:06,397
We can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.

618
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,363
Two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?

619
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:10,500
It's not dinner.        Fine.

620
00:31:10,504 --> 00:31:12,402
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

621
00:31:12,403 --> 00:31:14,673
in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.

622
00:31:14,692 --> 00:31:20,341
She's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.

623
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:22,914
Okay, so I put together a little bio, 

624
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:25,852
complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

625
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:29,754
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.

626
00:31:29,757 --> 00:31:33,018
I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.

627
00:31:33,127 --> 00:31:36,358
David Ershon is currently the CEO of Ershon Consortium.

628
00:31:36,464 --> 00:31:37,522
Who's that talking?

629
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:40,157
It's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.

630
00:31:40,268 --> 00:31:44,261
Ershon Consortium, current financial investments exceed $70 billion.

631
00:31:44,338 --> 00:31:47,664
His largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.

632
00:31:47,665 --> 00:31:50,171
Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.

633
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:52,183
Yeah, oil, media, health care, 

634
00:31:52,184 --> 00:31:53,339
you've probably heard their jingle.

635
00:31:53,448 --> 00:31:56,383
Lendl Global, we're in everything

636
00:31:56,484 --> 00:31:59,317
David Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...

637
00:31:59,387 --> 00:32:01,719
Yeah.        ...and the lead singer of Maroon 5.

638
00:32:01,823 --> 00:32:03,654
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels,

639
00:32:03,724 --> 00:32:06,957
black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.

640
00:32:06,961 --> 00:32:08,588
How do you get that from anything I just said?

641
00:32:08,589 --> 00:32:10,159
Hey, guys! Soup's on.

642
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:11,630
What do you mean?

643
00:32:13,734 --> 00:32:14,826
Hi.

644
00:32:14,902 --> 00:32:16,494
Hi.        You must be Terry.

645
00:32:16,571 --> 00:32:19,802
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.

646
00:32:21,175 --> 00:32:24,105
Who are you?        I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.

647
00:32:24,212 --> 00:32:26,840
Come on, seriously. Who is that?        His old lady.

648
00:32:26,914 --> 00:32:29,405
Sweetie, it's a workstation.        Got it.

649
00:32:29,517 --> 00:32:33,244
And you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.

650
00:32:33,254 --> 00:32:35,088
I know you're working. I'm so sorry.

651
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,380
Come on, seriously.        Come on, what?

652
00:32:37,381 --> 00:32:38,486
Who is that?

653
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,584
That's the old...That's the old ball and chain.

654
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,488
Get over here.

655
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:46,192
Not...Not right now.        Okay.

656
00:32:46,267 --> 00:32:48,258
Look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?

657
00:32:48,669 --> 00:32:50,068
Come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?

658
00:32:50,938 --> 00:32:54,430
Are you really Allen's wife?        I know.

659
00:32:54,542 --> 00:32:55,638
People are shocked 

660
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,001
because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic,

661
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,112
but somehow it works.

662
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,408
Are you gonna change?        I already did.

663
00:33:03,618 --> 00:33:05,745
It's no big deal. You look really, really nice.

664
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:10,214
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.

665
00:33:10,215 --> 00:33:11,655
Don't speak to her like that, Allen.

666
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,131
Look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, 

667
00:33:14,132 --> 00:33:15,692
you'd probably get a D-.

668
00:33:16,264 --> 00:33:18,171
Allen and his apps. He loves them.

669
00:33:18,172 --> 00:33:21,590
You know he's designed three of his own? One of them...Can I tell him?

670
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:24,136
One of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face,

671
00:33:24,238 --> 00:33:27,036
and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.

672
00:33:27,275 --> 00:33:28,606
Faceback.        Faceback.

673
00:33:28,709 --> 00:33:31,034
Got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.

674
00:33:31,112 --> 00:33:32,272
It's gonna hit.        It's gonna catch.

675
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,405
Why are you with Allen?

676
00:33:34,482 --> 00:33:38,684
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?

677
00:33:38,686 --> 00:33:40,920
It's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.

678
00:33:41,489 --> 00:33:42,683
You're gonna be bored by it.

679
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:43,932
I was a dancer for the Knicks 

680
00:33:43,953 --> 00:33:46,751
while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.

681
00:33:46,861 --> 00:33:49,391
Allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.

682
00:33:49,397 --> 00:33:50,255
Yes.

683
00:33:50,364 --> 00:33:52,992
Needless to say, I fell for him immediately.

684
00:33:53,401 --> 00:33:57,633
We immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn,

685
00:33:58,372 --> 00:34:00,704
and, to be honest, we didn't speak.        Three days

686
00:34:00,775 --> 00:34:03,335
of not communicating once verbally.

687
00:34:03,644 --> 00:34:05,703
We had actually, without knowing it,

688
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:11,047
developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.

689
00:34:11,285 --> 00:34:13,947
You know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.

690
00:34:14,388 --> 00:34:18,066
After those three days of non-verbal communication 

691
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,383
and a whole lot of loving,

692
00:34:19,627 --> 00:34:22,926
I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.

693
00:34:23,331 --> 00:34:26,960
Similar to operating on a German shepherd

694
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:31,263
when they have hip dysplasia.        Very painful.

695
00:34:31,606 --> 00:34:34,133
It's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie,

696
00:34:34,134 --> 00:34:35,634
 always forget the name of it.

697
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:36,903
With Meg Ryan.        Yes.

698
00:34:36,978 --> 00:34:38,704
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan 

699
00:34:38,705 --> 00:34:39,948
meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.

700
00:34:40,047 --> 00:34:42,447
I'll think of it. I'll think of it.        Okay.

701
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,245
So, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?

702
00:34:44,318 --> 00:34:46,309
I did, yeah.

703
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,888
We were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.

704
00:34:48,956 --> 00:34:50,331
Terry shot Derek Jeter.

705
00:34:50,332 --> 00:34:51,925
Shut up, Allen. This was before.

706
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:52,754
That's okay.

707
00:34:52,827 --> 00:34:54,795
She's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.

708
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,829
That's it! Honey!

709
00:34:56,931 --> 00:34:58,039
With Tom Hanks?        Right.

710
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,157
And Meg Ryan.        Meg Ryan.

711
00:34:59,267 --> 00:35:00,325
He didn't have poison ivy up his ass.

712
00:35:00,434 --> 00:35:01,731
Yes, he did.        Yes, he did. Yeah.

713
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:03,064
Way up there.

714
00:35:03,571 --> 00:35:06,165
Well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...

715
00:35:06,274 --> 00:35:08,161
What a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.

716
00:35:08,162 --> 00:35:10,769
It was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.

717
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:11,665
It was my pleasure. Thank you.

718
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:16,173
And remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.

719
00:35:16,284 --> 00:35:18,650
She tells me that every day before I leave.        Yep, I do.

720
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,819
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries,

721
00:35:21,922 --> 00:35:24,686
and I say, " Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today,

722
00:35:24,792 --> 00:35:26,089
"you just don't get hurt. "

723
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,691
Yeah. Every morning.

724
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:31,720
And then I show him my breasts, and I say, " These are waiting for you

725
00:35:31,721 --> 00:35:32,625
"when you get back home. "        Right.

726
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,601
You know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen,

727
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:38,104
but, man, are they perky.        Not by a long shot.

728
00:35:38,172 --> 00:35:40,834
And they are firm, and they are yours.        You're a nice lady.

729
00:35:42,643 --> 00:35:44,137
Thank you for coming.

730
00:35:44,211 --> 00:35:48,170
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.

731
00:35:48,282 --> 00:35:49,340
Go for Hoitz.

732
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:50,974
We found your red Prius.        Great.

733
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:53,145
It was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.

734
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:55,450
Come on.        Okay, sugar balls, listen up.

735
00:35:55,523 --> 00:35:56,820
There's gonna be fingerprints on that car.

736
00:35:56,891 --> 00:35:59,523
Tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.

737
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:00,524
And if we get a hit, 

738
00:36:00,991 --> 00:36:02,991
this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.

739
00:36:03,064 --> 00:36:05,396
You do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.

740
00:36:05,499 --> 00:36:06,557
Okay.        Thank you, Sheila.

741
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:07,725
He'll bring it.

742
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:09,462
Good night!        Good night.

743
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:10,868
Thank you, Sheila.

744
00:36:11,205 --> 00:36:14,231
Bye, Terry!        Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.

745
00:36:14,342 --> 00:36:16,139
Bye, Terry!        All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.

746
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,302
Bye, Sheila!

747
00:36:17,378 --> 00:36:18,868
Night!        See you...See you, Terry!

748
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:20,837
Bye, Sheila.

749
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:27,413
I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!

750
00:36:27,521 --> 00:36:29,079
Bye, Sheila!

751
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:36,929
Well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.

752
00:36:37,031 --> 00:36:38,692
You find anything?

753
00:36:38,766 --> 00:36:41,530
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

754
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,570
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

755
00:36:43,671 --> 00:36:46,077
we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes 

756
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,198
had an orgy in the car.

757
00:36:47,198 --> 00:36:49,038
Oh, God.        Yeah.

758
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,941
You know what that's called when they do that in there?

759
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:52,512
That's called a soup kitchen.

760
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,172
It's pretty rough stuff.

761
00:36:54,248 --> 00:36:57,740
Not long after that, a mama raccoon came along

762
00:36:57,852 --> 00:36:59,251
and gave birth on the floor.

763
00:37:00,087 --> 00:37:02,169
Placenta blew out all over the back window there.

764
00:37:02,823 --> 00:37:05,451
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along

765
00:37:05,726 --> 00:37:08,820
takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.

766
00:37:09,163 --> 00:37:10,892
I think he knew you guys were cops,

767
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:14,166
because this is what I would call a spite shit.

768
00:37:14,235 --> 00:37:15,668
You were able to determine all of that

769
00:37:15,736 --> 00:37:17,567
from the hair and fluid samples?        Oh, yeah.

770
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:19,887
What about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?

771
00:37:19,907 --> 00:37:22,502
Nope, couldn't get a one.        Found a cell phone.

772
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,604
Yeah, that's mine.

773
00:37:23,744 --> 00:37:25,477
Any signs of a struggle or spent shells?

774
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,098
No. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.

775
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,143
In fact, they even left you a note here.

776
00:37:32,219 --> 00:37:36,216
"Thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys. "

777
00:37:36,256 --> 00:37:37,080
Here's something we found.

778
00:37:37,158 --> 00:37:39,752
We found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.

779
00:37:39,927 --> 00:37:42,987
No fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.

780
00:37:43,164 --> 00:37:44,583
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.

781
00:37:44,584 --> 00:37:46,764
 I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.

782
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:50,303
It's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.

783
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,134
Found a deer vagina.

784
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:55,508
What?        Thought it was human lips at first.

785
00:37:55,509 --> 00:37:57,877
Then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.

786
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:01,528
Not even a free ticket.

787
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:03,444
What are we gonna do?

788
00:38:03,551 --> 00:38:06,911
We got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.

789
00:38:06,914 --> 00:38:09,822
Look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.

790
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,858
They used your phone?        They ghost dialed.

791
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:13,086
Someone probably sat on it.

792
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:14,362
It could have recorded some of 

793
00:38:14,363 --> 00:38:16,025
their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.

794
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,861
We gotta hear the other side of that call.

795
00:38:18,532 --> 00:38:19,897
Nope, no, it's nothing.

796
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,398
Nothing?        It's nothing.

797
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,402
It's the only lead we have.        It's nothing.

798
00:38:22,403 --> 00:38:23,702
Why did you just get super jumpy?

799
00:38:24,805 --> 00:38:25,897
What?

800
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,941
It's an ex-girlfriend, okay?

801
00:38:28,042 --> 00:38:29,771
What's the matter? What happened with you guys?

802
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,708
She was just a bit of a handful, that's it.

803
00:38:36,717 --> 00:38:38,941
Allen, it's the only lead we have.

804
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,084
We either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.

805
00:38:41,655 --> 00:38:43,555
Fine. Let's go see her.

806
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,732
Hello, Christinith.

807
00:38:57,805 --> 00:38:59,397
Hello, Allen.

808
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,573
That's my partner, Terry.        Hi, Telly.

809
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:08,775
Holy shit. Dude.        Just relax, relax.

810
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:13,552
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.

811
00:39:14,288 --> 00:39:16,256
That was 13 years ago.

812
00:39:19,326 --> 00:39:22,688
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.

813
00:39:22,689 --> 00:39:24,703
 Who wants some Arnie Palmies?

814
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:27,191
Sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.

815
00:39:27,301 --> 00:39:30,464
Hal, just place it down, please.        All righty.

816
00:39:31,305 --> 00:39:32,533
Okay.

817
00:39:36,677 --> 00:39:41,808
I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.

818
00:39:41,882 --> 00:39:43,179
No.

819
00:39:43,284 --> 00:39:45,659
Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.

820
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,826
Oh, no, he knows all of this.

821
00:39:46,861 --> 00:39:48,644
You're a lucky dog.        It's true.

822
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:53,557
Christine, this is a lovely house.

823
00:39:53,661 --> 00:39:56,987
It's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?

824
00:39:56,988 --> 00:39:59,891
Christinith, you idiot!

825
00:39:59,933 --> 00:40:04,522
You come to our house, you get my wife's name right!

826
00:40:04,638 --> 00:40:06,003
What?        Christinith!

827
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:08,837
Look, we really appreciate the hospitality.

828
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:11,337
We'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.

829
00:40:11,412 --> 00:40:14,670
We believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.

830
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:21,170
Okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it

831
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:24,681
and everyone else stay here.

832
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:27,520
Okay, sweetie.        Come on.

833
00:40:31,398 --> 00:40:33,764
There's my phone.        Great, thank you for...

834
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:40,907
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

835
00:40:40,908 --> 00:40:44,075
You're so strong.        I'm stronger than you will ever know!

836
00:40:44,144 --> 00:40:47,170
I hate you! I hate you!

837
00:40:47,281 --> 00:40:50,773
You're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.

838
00:40:50,851 --> 00:40:54,887
You go, "I wuv you. " Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith. "

839
00:41:00,594 --> 00:41:05,031
You probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.

840
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:07,100
But I'm not.

841
00:41:08,502 --> 00:41:09,969
Shaved.

842
00:41:10,471 --> 00:41:12,200
Allen!        He's fine.

843
00:41:13,173 --> 00:41:14,367
Question.

844
00:41:15,409 --> 00:41:16,569
What would you rather be,

845
00:41:17,945 --> 00:41:20,413
a bear or a dog?

846
00:41:20,581 --> 00:41:23,516
I don't care.        I wanna be

847
00:41:24,885 --> 00:41:27,445
a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

848
00:41:28,122 --> 00:41:30,488
'Cause that way, I could live in the house

849
00:41:30,758 --> 00:41:34,127
but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.

850
00:41:34,528 --> 00:41:35,756
Allen!

851
00:41:40,034 --> 00:41:41,524
Allen! Allen!

852
00:41:41,602 --> 00:41:44,833
This is police evidence. Terry! Let's go!        Hey!

853
00:41:44,905 --> 00:41:47,430
You get back here and you make love to my wife!

854
00:41:47,541 --> 00:41:49,065
Allen! Allen!

855
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:53,437
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.

856
00:41:53,547 --> 00:41:55,777
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.

857
00:41:55,883 --> 00:41:57,510
Your wife is crazy hot.

858
00:41:57,584 --> 00:41:59,517
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, 

859
00:41:59,518 --> 00:42:00,781
she threw you a "Do me" vibe.

860
00:42:00,854 --> 00:42:02,321
What is it with you and hot ladies?

861
00:42:02,389 --> 00:42:06,106
First off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.

862
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:09,920
Dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.

863
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,796
You wanna listen to this message or not?        Yeah, whatever.

864
00:42:12,799 --> 00:42:14,066
You have one job, mate.

865
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:16,459
Find a sucker to invest with you

866
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,271
so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.

867
00:42:18,272 --> 00:42:19,500
And I don't care who.

868
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:21,905
Right. I actually think I found a sucker...

869
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,443
He's talking to Ershon. ...to invest $32 billion.

870
00:42:24,545 --> 00:42:26,433
Who's got $32 billion to rob?

871
00:42:26,434 --> 00:42:28,443
Once I get the money, I'll falsify the records

872
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:31,346
to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.

873
00:42:31,418 --> 00:42:35,081
Now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,

874
00:42:35,189 --> 00:42:36,747
and after that...

875
00:42:36,857 --> 00:42:38,620
I told you it wasn't a security team.

876
00:42:38,926 --> 00:42:42,449
He was being abducted.        Obviously, but what kind...Holy...

877
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:43,720
Nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!

878
00:42:43,797 --> 00:42:44,957
Is that him?        Yeah!

879
00:42:45,065 --> 00:42:46,862
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!

880
00:42:46,934 --> 00:42:48,765
Holy shit!        They chased us 20 miles.

881
00:42:48,869 --> 00:42:51,264
You come back here! You get back here!        Allen!

882
00:42:58,812 --> 00:43:02,407
2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.

883
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,845
Holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.

884
00:43:05,846 --> 00:43:08,353
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.

885
00:43:08,372 --> 00:43:11,375
$32 billion. That's the state's money.

886
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:13,253
Well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.

887
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:15,687
We have a scratchy cell phone message and an address. 

888
00:43:15,688 --> 00:43:16,800
It's still half a case.

889
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,857
There's gotta be some sort of paper trail. 

890
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:20,594
If we can find that, if we can track it,

891
00:43:21,378 --> 00:43:22,683
then we can go to Mauch.

892
00:43:22,936 --> 00:43:26,929
So, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm,

893
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,736
and I found some pretty interesting stuff.

894
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:31,972
It turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...

895
00:43:33,413 --> 00:43:35,108
Hold on, I'm up.

896
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:39,476
I gave my love to Erin

897
00:43:40,454 --> 00:43:44,117
She promised to be true

898
00:43:44,658 --> 00:43:48,651
I went to war to come back

899
00:43:48,762 --> 00:43:52,698
And find five British soldiers

900
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,997
Had their way with her

901
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,539
It was consensual

902
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:02,333
Done?

903
00:44:02,442 --> 00:44:05,477
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

904
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:08,539
has only one client, David Ershon.

905
00:44:08,649 --> 00:44:11,174
Pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.

906
00:44:11,285 --> 00:44:13,981
Looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.

907
00:44:14,054 --> 00:44:16,818
That's a shitty day.

908
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:22,119
And all their fathers were hanged

909
00:44:22,196 --> 00:44:25,654
And the children all got pink eye

910
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:35,972
While their Harry Potter books were burned

911
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:42,928
Do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.

912
00:44:42,929 --> 00:44:45,150
I do. They're full of rich history.

913
00:44:46,353 --> 00:44:48,844
Damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.

914
00:44:48,846 --> 00:44:50,822
I thought you said you guys split up.

915
00:44:50,891 --> 00:44:53,416
Let's just keep our thing about work, okay?

916
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,085
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

917
00:44:55,195 --> 00:44:57,186
Hey, get off me, man.

918
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:18,512
What the hell are you doing?

919
00:45:18,585 --> 00:45:21,559
I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?

920
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:23,416
I love you, Francine.

921
00:45:23,523 --> 00:45:24,000
If you were with me, 

922
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,955
you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!

923
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,888
This is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.

924
00:45:31,965 --> 00:45:34,024
He loves you very much, Francine.

925
00:45:34,101 --> 00:45:36,919
Who is this guy?        What are you doing here, Allen?

926
00:45:36,937 --> 00:45:38,264
It's the code. I'm your partner.

927
00:45:38,472 --> 00:45:41,532
I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.

928
00:45:41,608 --> 00:45:43,098
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

929
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:46,167
Who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.

930
00:45:46,168 --> 00:45:49,582
He is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?

931
00:45:49,650 --> 00:45:51,447
I know that this is a big surprise,

932
00:45:51,551 --> 00:45:54,614
but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?

933
00:45:55,055 --> 00:45:57,922
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.

934
00:45:57,991 --> 00:46:00,088
What, you don't think I can do this shit?

935
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,835
That was surprisingly good, Terry.

936
00:46:18,836 --> 00:46:21,908
I love you, Francine.        You don't know what love is.

937
00:46:21,915 --> 00:46:23,679
He loves you very much, Francine!

938
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:25,700
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.

939
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:27,847
You know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.

940
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,447
And don't eyeball me, man!

941
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,524
You're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?

942
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:32,283
Terry!

943
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:34,254
He does not approve of your behavior!

944
00:46:34,256 --> 00:46:36,129
Can you please go?

945
00:46:36,196 --> 00:46:38,944
And you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?

946
00:46:42,636 --> 00:46:43,830
Let's go, Allen.

947
00:46:44,304 --> 00:46:46,864
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.

948
00:46:47,207 --> 00:46:49,004
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

949
00:46:49,476 --> 00:46:51,034
You're kind of making things worse.

950
00:47:00,654 --> 00:47:03,487
You okay?        Yeah, I'm fine.

951
00:47:04,925 --> 00:47:07,416
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.

952
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:10,830
We used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids,

953
00:47:10,897 --> 00:47:12,262
show them how queer they were, okay?

954
00:47:14,201 --> 00:47:17,193
You learned to dance like that sarcastically?        Yeah, I guess.

955
00:47:17,270 --> 00:47:20,831
Stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.

956
00:47:20,907 --> 00:47:24,070
Stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.

957
00:47:24,511 --> 00:47:26,069
All right, Terry.

958
00:47:26,613 --> 00:47:30,208
Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.

959
00:47:52,739 --> 00:47:56,106
Here, check this out. Article from six months ago.

960
00:47:56,209 --> 00:47:57,767
Talking about how the lottery is looking

961
00:47:57,878 --> 00:48:00,608
to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.

962
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:02,267
So he's dealing drugs?

963
00:48:02,482 --> 00:48:06,282
No, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.

964
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,220
Look, I'm sorry. I just...

965
00:48:11,925 --> 00:48:16,624
I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.

966
00:48:17,164 --> 00:48:18,529
What happened?

967
00:48:20,434 --> 00:48:23,232
She was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?

968
00:48:23,870 --> 00:48:25,804
Called "The Art of Oral Sex"?

969
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,769
You know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.

970
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,344
It's always about her.

971
00:48:31,745 --> 00:48:33,713
Yeah, that's...That's messed up.

972
00:48:35,449 --> 00:48:36,939
Hey, I got you a gift.

973
00:48:37,451 --> 00:48:39,747
I just saw something, and I thought of you, 

974
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:41,760
and so, I don't want it to be weird.

975
00:48:41,761 --> 00:48:42,755
I just wanted to be nice.

976
00:48:42,756 --> 00:48:43,853
Of course it's weird.

977
00:48:43,924 --> 00:48:45,755
It's a grown man giving another man a present.

978
00:48:47,427 --> 00:48:49,759
There you go. Open it up.

979
00:48:50,363 --> 00:48:52,263
It's okay, you're welcome.

980
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,467
I like to do things like that.

981
00:48:54,801 --> 00:48:55,730
Take a look what it says.

982
00:48:59,070 --> 00:48:59,870
FBI
FBI.

983
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:01,870
Female Body Inspector.

984
00:49:05,812 --> 00:49:08,280
You know, because we're both in law enforcement.

985
00:49:08,381 --> 00:49:09,939
We both like women.

986
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:13,042
But I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.

987
00:49:13,386 --> 00:49:15,547
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.

988
00:49:15,622 --> 00:49:16,919
Me, too.

989
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:23,490
Real nice. You know, it's all class.

990
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,131
Okay.        Don't do that shit any more.

991
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:28,599
Yeah, believe me, I won't.

992
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:31,534
Do you understand what's so funny about it, though?

993
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:37,001
'Cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.

994
00:49:37,006 --> 00:49:39,609
And at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI."

995
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,844
But then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?

996
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:47,279
Get out of town. This is outrageous...

997
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,449
Shut up!

998
00:50:00,967 --> 00:50:03,197
I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours

999
00:50:03,270 --> 00:50:04,362
one of these days,

1000
00:50:04,437 --> 00:50:06,598
and it's gonna be glorious.

1001
00:50:10,143 --> 00:50:13,175
Shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?

1002
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:14,461
For what? We're just going to check it out.

1003
00:50:14,462 --> 00:50:16,046
I know, but it's procedure.

1004
00:50:17,117 --> 00:50:19,244
Terry answers to no one.

1005
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,081
I do what I do.

1006
00:50:23,123 --> 00:50:25,991
What accounting firm is closed at 11:00 a. m. On a Tuesday?

1007
00:50:25,992 --> 00:50:26,971
This is a shithole.

1008
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:35,659
I love bombs.

1009
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:38,932
I can't hear! I can't hear!

1010
00:50:40,407 --> 00:50:42,398
There's blood blisters on my hands!

1011
00:50:42,475 --> 00:50:43,567
Oh, my God!

1012
00:50:43,643 --> 00:50:45,941
How do they walk away in movies without flinching

1013
00:50:46,012 --> 00:50:47,741
when it explodes behind them?

1014
00:50:47,814 --> 00:50:51,289
There's no way! I call bullshit on that!

1015
00:50:51,418 --> 00:50:54,751
When they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star,

1016
00:50:54,821 --> 00:50:59,094
and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!

1017
00:50:59,095 --> 00:51:02,190
Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!

1018
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:04,263
I need an MRI.

1019
00:51:04,331 --> 00:51:08,631
I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.

1020
00:51:09,102 --> 00:51:11,787
There's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.

1021
00:51:11,788 --> 00:51:12,470
Please stop.

1022
00:51:12,471 --> 00:51:15,201
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!

1023
00:51:18,278 --> 00:51:20,044
Fire Department said it was a gas leak, 

1024
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:22,199
but no way. That was timed.

1025
00:51:22,716 --> 00:51:24,693
They didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.

1026
00:51:24,694 --> 00:51:27,109
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?

1027
00:51:27,187 --> 00:51:29,815
I'm tired of this. All right?

1028
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:32,449
I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.

1029
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:34,652
I wanna go back to my desk.

1030
00:51:34,728 --> 00:51:38,220
Guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.

1031
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:40,899
You can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.

1032
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:43,631
You know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?

1033
00:51:43,703 --> 00:51:46,638
There's no explosions at my desk.

1034
00:51:46,706 --> 00:51:51,643
There's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.

1035
00:51:53,980 --> 00:51:55,709
What are you afraid of, man?

1036
00:51:56,850 --> 00:52:01,344
I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?

1037
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:04,454
I was a sophomore in college.

1038
00:52:05,859 --> 00:52:09,920
The university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.

1039
00:52:11,064 --> 00:52:12,688
A classmate of mine, Brenda, 

1040
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,901
in an effort to raise money and stay in school,

1041
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:18,938
came up with a nifty plan

1042
00:52:19,039 --> 00:52:21,773
where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.

1043
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:23,233
I go on dates all the time,

1044
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:25,437
with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.

1045
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:27,678
And I kind of need somebody to help me out, 

1046
00:52:27,679 --> 00:52:29,381
like, you know, my partner in crime.

1047
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:31,713
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

1048
00:52:31,785 --> 00:52:33,377
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1049
00:52:33,453 --> 00:52:35,978
Provide transportation services.        Yeah, yeah.

1050
00:52:36,089 --> 00:52:38,416
It's gonna be a good time.        Thanks so much for asking me.

1051
00:52:38,417 --> 00:52:40,759
She said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay

1052
00:52:40,827 --> 00:52:44,285
and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.

1053
00:52:44,397 --> 00:52:47,662
Oh, my God. You were a pimp.        What? God, no.

1054
00:52:47,767 --> 00:52:49,826
No, I was just trying to help a friend.

1055
00:52:49,936 --> 00:52:52,496
We started making a lot of money.

1056
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:56,407
And wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends

1057
00:52:56,476 --> 00:52:59,172
decided they wanted to be a part of it.

1058
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:01,941
Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting

1059
00:53:02,015 --> 00:53:03,642
while they gave me money.

1060
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,564
That's called a stable of whores.

1061
00:53:06,186 --> 00:53:08,181
We decided I shouldn't use my real name.

1062
00:53:09,370 --> 00:53:11,124
 So we came up with the name "Gator. "

1063
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:12,825
I'm telling you, you were a pimp.

1064
00:53:12,926 --> 00:53:15,520
No! Are you even listening to the story?

1065
00:53:18,331 --> 00:53:20,474
Anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror,

1066
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,764
and I don't like what I see.

1067
00:53:24,003 --> 00:53:28,030
I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.

1068
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:30,673
You can't have a conscience in the pimp game.

1069
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:33,173
One night, two of my favorite girls,

1070
00:53:33,279 --> 00:53:35,474
Candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in,"

1071
00:53:35,548 --> 00:53:37,846
and they dropped me off at the emergency room.

1072
00:53:37,951 --> 00:53:40,131
That's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.

1073
00:53:40,572 --> 00:53:42,397
I made a promise to myself and to her 

1074
00:53:42,398 --> 00:53:44,443
that I would never get out of control again.

1075
00:53:45,992 --> 00:53:47,357
So, as soon as I graduated from college,

1076
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:50,361
I became an accountant for the police department.

1077
00:53:50,997 --> 00:53:53,693
The most stable job I could think of.

1078
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:57,701
An accountant for law and order.

1079
00:54:00,006 --> 00:54:04,067
I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.

1080
00:54:04,177 --> 00:54:06,873
Don't worry. I got your back.

1081
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,680
Now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.

1082
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:13,248
I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around.        Okay.

1083
00:54:13,586 --> 00:54:16,616
You can either walk the plank or take your panties off.

1084
00:54:16,617 --> 00:54:18,016
The choice is yours.

1085
00:54:18,091 --> 00:54:21,068
I want to take my panties off.

1086
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:22,957
You've made a wise choice, you have.

1087
00:54:22,958 --> 00:54:24,331
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble 

1088
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:26,860
and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.

1089
00:54:27,767 --> 00:54:29,029
Gentlemen, please.

1090
00:54:29,102 --> 00:54:32,401
Remember us, hotshot?        Of course I do. Please, sit.

1091
00:54:32,505 --> 00:54:34,166
There she blows.

1092
00:54:36,576 --> 00:54:39,841
Two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.

1093
00:54:39,913 --> 00:54:43,041
Guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.

1094
00:54:43,383 --> 00:54:45,613
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1095
00:54:45,718 --> 00:54:46,701
Gas leak? 

1096
00:54:47,091 --> 00:54:49,791
The only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.

1097
00:54:49,791 --> 00:54:54,750
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.

1098
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:57,757
I absolutely abhor death.

1099
00:54:57,797 --> 00:55:01,255
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?

1100
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:03,558
We know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.

1101
00:55:03,559 --> 00:55:06,035
And we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.

1102
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,390
You talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.

1103
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:10,900
God, this water is good. Terry,

1104
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,773
have you tried the water?        Shut up Allen

1105
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:16,150
I assure you I have no idea what you're talking about

1106
00:55:16,255 --> 00:55:18,802
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up 

1107
00:55:18,803 --> 00:55:20,158
with the whole scaffolding business.

1108
00:55:20,259 --> 00:55:25,663
The cucumber accents the water in such a way that...

1109
00:55:26,832 --> 00:55:28,550
Perhaps by way of apology, 

1110
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:31,566
I can offer you my personal courtside seats

1111
00:55:31,637 --> 00:55:35,801
for the Knicks game, with access to the Ambassador Club.

1112
00:55:38,177 --> 00:55:40,505
Come on, Knicks! Come on! 

1113
00:55:40,609 --> 00:55:43,309
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!

1114
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:48,677
Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.

1115
00:55:48,787 --> 00:55:53,315
It is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.

1116
00:55:53,425 --> 00:55:54,687
come on

1117
00:55:55,528 --> 00:55:56,859
call me

1118
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:00,127
Excuse me.        That was a trick.

1119
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:01,598
No more

1120
00:56:01,667 --> 00:56:07,037
Gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.

1121
00:56:10,376 --> 00:56:13,436
Fantastic! You're so unbelievable!

1122
00:56:17,950 --> 00:56:19,850
Damn it. He did it again.

1123
00:56:20,819 --> 00:56:23,117
Excuse me.        No more tickets.

1124
00:56:23,188 --> 00:56:25,122
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.

1125
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,455
That's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.

1126
00:56:28,527 --> 00:56:30,392
No, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.

1127
00:56:30,496 --> 00:56:32,521
No, I was very much looking forward to having a water.

1128
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:37,068
How great is Jersey Boys?        It's not great. It's fantastic!

1129
00:56:37,169 --> 00:56:40,502
You totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.

1130
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:42,200
Wow, what a musical.

1131
00:56:42,308 --> 00:56:44,173
Hey. Get over here.

1132
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,471
What's wrong with you?        What?

1133
00:56:46,545 --> 00:56:48,035
That's not what we're here for.

1134
00:56:48,981 --> 00:56:51,040
We're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?

1135
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:54,376
It's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.

1136
00:56:54,486 --> 00:56:56,317
I come strong, then you come in.

1137
00:56:56,318 --> 00:56:57,180
You got it?        Yeah.

1138
00:56:57,186 --> 00:56:59,718
I come strong, then you come in.        Right. Got it.

1139
00:56:59,825 --> 00:57:01,725
Now you listen to me, you piece of shit.

1140
00:57:01,994 --> 00:57:04,554
It's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!

1141
00:57:04,663 --> 00:57:06,561
How did you cover your losses up? 

1142
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:08,862
What drug cartel are you working with now?

1143
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:12,870
Okay, I'll talk to you, you're reasonable!        No, no, look at me!

1144
00:57:12,938 --> 00:57:15,406
You wanna talk to me? You wanna talk to me?

1145
00:57:15,507 --> 00:57:18,999
Allen, what are you doing? What are you doing? Allen!

1146
00:57:19,845 --> 00:57:22,335
I'm gonna make you eat a plate of human shit!

1147
00:57:22,748 --> 00:57:24,545
Get away from me!

1148
00:57:29,254 --> 00:57:30,721
Where is he?

1149
00:57:32,758 --> 00:57:35,352
Look, I'm really sorry about that.

1150
00:57:36,195 --> 00:57:38,720
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought,

1151
00:57:38,797 --> 00:57:41,339
"Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that, 

1152
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,527
"since we're doing bad cop, bad cop. "

1153
00:57:42,534 --> 00:57:43,964
What? No, I said, 

1154
00:57:43,965 --> 00:57:47,598
"Good cop, bad cop. " I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.

1155
00:57:47,706 --> 00:57:49,234
Okay, then there it is. 

1156
00:57:49,235 --> 00:57:52,310
That's it. I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop. "

1157
00:57:52,444 --> 00:57:55,880
Well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.

1158
00:57:55,948 --> 00:57:58,041
Think it's his phone sheet.        Nice.

1159
00:57:58,384 --> 00:58:00,079
Seven calls to the lottery office.

1160
00:58:00,419 --> 00:58:01,943
That could be the evidence we need for Mauch.

1161
00:58:04,723 --> 00:58:07,590
Get back. Colombian drug lords.        Where are you getting that from?

1162
00:58:09,395 --> 00:58:10,589
Jeesus

1163
00:58:19,405 --> 00:58:21,839
Can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?

1164
00:58:29,648 --> 00:58:31,084
We call this in, right?

1165
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:32,982
Looks like we got all the evidence we need.

1166
00:58:33,085 --> 00:58:35,144
I'm sorry, my butterfly.

1167
00:58:36,522 --> 00:58:39,457
We'll load them up, send them back to go.

1168
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,499
Holy shit.        What?

1169
00:58:51,603 --> 00:58:54,299
What do you mean, what? Where are we?

1170
00:58:55,674 --> 00:58:57,107
We're in the high desert.

1171
00:58:57,176 --> 00:59:00,942
They took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?

1172
00:59:01,013 --> 00:59:02,537
They took your wooden gun?        Yeah.

1173
00:59:09,121 --> 00:59:11,351
Hello?        Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.

1174
00:59:11,457 --> 00:59:12,856
Captain, it's Allen Gamble.

1175
00:59:12,958 --> 00:59:14,789
Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?

1176
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:17,658
Captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

1177
00:59:17,659 --> 00:59:19,197
We are in Las Vegas, all right?

1178
00:59:19,298 --> 00:59:20,649
We were kidnapped, 

1179
00:59:21,100 --> 00:59:22,816
put on a freight train, and shipped out here.

1180
00:59:22,835 --> 00:59:25,169
Let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.

1181
00:59:25,237 --> 00:59:26,836
Captain, I am being straight with you.

1182
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:29,037
Look, we think something's going on, okay?

1183
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:32,208
We think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.

1184
00:59:32,227 --> 00:59:37,615
Wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?

1185
00:59:38,016 --> 00:59:39,313
Terry, Captain wants to know

1186
00:59:39,384 --> 00:59:41,618
how many times has he asked us to lay off of Ershon.

1187
00:59:41,686 --> 00:59:42,678
Twice.

1188
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:45,385
Twice. Terry says twice. I agree.

1189
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:47,249
I'm hanging up. I'm done.

1190
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:54,624
I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand for that, 

1191
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:56,467
a taste for that Pai Gow.

1192
00:59:56,769 --> 01:00:01,365
Martin and Fosse, super cops, in three, two...

1193
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:07,345
So, we busted that junkie. Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.

1194
01:00:08,447 --> 01:00:09,880
Solved the Castien case.

1195
01:00:09,948 --> 01:00:12,746
$74,000? That's all they took?

1196
01:00:12,851 --> 01:00:15,081
There's millions of dollars of diamonds in that place.

1197
01:00:15,187 --> 01:00:17,348
How about this, Gamble? How about you shut your face?

1198
01:00:17,422 --> 01:00:19,014
All right? Just shut it.

1199
01:00:19,091 --> 01:00:21,118
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain's looking for you.

1200
01:00:23,695 --> 01:00:25,925
I know it's off the subject, but is Kevlar copyrighted?

1201
01:00:26,031 --> 01:00:27,293
Captain?        Yeah.

1202
01:00:27,399 --> 01:00:29,890
Is it a bad time?        No, come on. Come on.

1203
01:00:30,269 --> 01:00:32,100
Not me, right?        Yeah, and you.

1204
01:00:32,204 --> 01:00:34,299
Fellows, I'm sure you're familiar 

1205
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,327
with the venerable DA Radford.

1206
01:00:36,362 --> 01:00:37,935
He wanted to come down and pay us a visit.

1207
01:00:37,943 --> 01:00:38,971
Hello, gentlemen.

1208
01:00:39,077 --> 01:00:40,203
Hello, sir.        Hey.

1209
01:00:40,279 --> 01:00:43,646
You know, I was talking to Gene here.        He prefers "Captain. "

1210
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:47,241
Yes, I was talking to Gene here, and, you know, it's funny.

1211
01:00:47,553 --> 01:00:49,783
I don't know what you two have been up to,

1212
01:00:49,888 --> 01:00:53,655
but I've been getting calls from people I don't ever get calls from.

1213
01:00:53,656 --> 01:00:56,260
In 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.

1214
01:00:56,895 --> 01:00:59,140
When that happens, stop.

1215
01:01:00,165 --> 01:01:03,259
Gene, how's the family?        Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.

1216
01:01:03,335 --> 01:01:05,326
My son's bisexual, so...        Tremendous.

1217
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,344
Gentlemen, do we understand each other?

1218
01:01:10,976 --> 01:01:13,137
Cut the crap!        Will do.

1219
01:01:17,516 --> 01:01:18,949
Guy never comes down here.

1220
01:01:19,017 --> 01:01:21,850
Twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.

1221
01:01:21,954 --> 01:01:25,117
He's a heavyweight cat, that guy.        He was sitting right here.

1222
01:01:25,524 --> 01:01:28,960
Yeah. I think you missed the point. Anyway, look.

1223
01:01:29,027 --> 01:01:32,091
Blue and white found your firearms down by the Hudson River. 

1224
01:01:32,092 --> 01:01:33,154
Here you go, Terry.

1225
01:01:34,189 --> 01:01:35,622
You know what?

1226
01:01:36,301 --> 01:01:38,269
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.

1227
01:01:38,337 --> 01:01:40,202
To give me back my real gun?        No.

1228
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:42,364
'Cause I'm gonna give you this.

1229
01:01:43,108 --> 01:01:46,271
It's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble

1230
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:49,439
and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.

1231
01:01:50,816 --> 01:01:53,430
We were abducted, Captain! This shit is real! 

1232
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:55,829
Ershon's dirty. He's targeting the lottery!

1233
01:01:55,864 --> 01:01:57,661
Next, I want you guys to hand in 

1234
01:01:57,662 --> 01:02:00,458
all the evidence you think you have to the SEC.

1235
01:02:00,525 --> 01:02:02,456
The financial district's under their jurisdiction.

1236
01:02:02,461 --> 01:02:05,029
Don't you get it? This case is talking to us!

1237
01:02:05,047 --> 01:02:08,125
I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!

1238
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:11,101
You know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.

1239
01:02:11,169 --> 01:02:14,627
They fly, they fly a little bit.        Yeah, about as much as a penguin.

1240
01:02:14,706 --> 01:02:18,335
One more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.

1241
01:02:19,044 --> 01:02:21,804
Was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?

1242
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:23,505
I don't even understand the reference.

1243
01:02:24,049 --> 01:02:26,276
You don't understand what you said?        I don't know what that is.

1244
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:27,718
Get out.        Go.

1245
01:02:38,463 --> 01:02:40,693
How did they get that story?

1246
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:45,203
I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.

1247
01:02:45,304 --> 01:02:46,362
Hey, guys.

1248
01:02:46,738 --> 01:02:50,640
There's a proxy vote for a big reinvestment of the pension coming up,

1249
01:02:50,709 --> 01:02:53,576
so if you just wanna come by the old...        Damn it, Bob!

1250
01:02:53,679 --> 01:02:54,737
Let me ask you something.

1251
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:57,246
What do you even do around here besides interrupt people?

1252
01:02:57,950 --> 01:03:00,350
Well, I serve as treasurer to the union.

1253
01:03:00,419 --> 01:03:03,252
I make a wicked pot of decaf.

1254
01:03:03,355 --> 01:03:06,886
Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!

1255
01:03:08,527 --> 01:03:12,054
Probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.

1256
01:03:12,965 --> 01:03:14,762
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1257
01:03:14,866 --> 01:03:16,128
Bob!        Say something.

1258
01:03:16,234 --> 01:03:18,099
Come on! Bob!

1259
01:03:18,203 --> 01:03:21,154
I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.

1260
01:03:38,924 --> 01:03:44,021
Actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.

1261
01:03:44,396 --> 01:03:46,739
This coffee table?        Yes. We don't put drinks on it.

1262
01:03:50,268 --> 01:03:53,230
Five hundred thousand?        He can read! Congratulations.

1263
01:03:53,405 --> 01:03:55,566
What?        I'm sorry, are you in the right place?

1264
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,938
Or not? I'm...

1265
01:03:59,144 --> 01:04:00,338
Terry.        Does he... Okay.

1266
01:04:00,412 --> 01:04:03,677
Well...        Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?

1267
01:04:04,916 --> 01:04:09,285
I want to be with you.        No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.

1268
01:04:09,654 --> 01:04:12,582
You know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.

1269
01:04:13,125 --> 01:04:15,150
Instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?

1270
01:04:15,327 --> 01:04:16,885
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!

1271
01:04:16,962 --> 01:04:19,836
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.

1272
01:04:19,837 --> 01:04:24,113
The chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.

1273
01:04:24,436 --> 01:04:26,427
You think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?

1274
01:04:26,805 --> 01:04:28,697
This coffee table isn't the ego. 

1275
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,266
It represents our shattered sense of community

1276
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,573
in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.

1277
01:04:33,678 --> 01:04:35,585
Looks like the work of Cindy Sherman 

1278
01:04:35,586 --> 01:04:36,457
or Frank Stella.

1279
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:38,562
How did you know that, Terry?

1280
01:04:38,683 --> 01:04:40,151
I took some classes at RISD

1281
01:04:40,152 --> 01:04:42,534
so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.

1282
01:04:42,554 --> 01:04:44,954
Terry, lower your voice!        I don't have to lower my voice.

1283
01:04:45,023 --> 01:04:46,478
Is this man bothering you?

1284
01:04:46,479 --> 01:04:48,152
Are you actually having sex with this creep?

1285
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,991
Terry, he's gay. Okay?

1286
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:53,925
He's even wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm gay"!

1287
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:56,314
All right? And also, he is my boss.

1288
01:04:56,401 --> 01:04:57,561
Happy for you, man. Good.

1289
01:04:57,636 --> 01:04:59,501
Can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.

1290
01:04:59,704 --> 01:05:03,037
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.

1291
01:05:03,475 --> 01:05:05,534
Nice toot, sailor.        Jesus.

1292
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,712
Terry, what are you doing?

1293
01:05:09,214 --> 01:05:12,615
Look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?

1294
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:14,179
Just give me one more year.

1295
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,169
Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.

1296
01:05:17,522 --> 01:05:18,580
Fine.

1297
01:05:19,057 --> 01:05:22,254
Terry, don't touch that! Terry!        Oh, my God!

1298
01:05:22,594 --> 01:05:24,528
I don't need this shit. I don't need you!

1299
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,863
And when you call me, I'm not coming back!

1300
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:32,260
Oh, boy! Over the top!        How outr?

1301
01:05:32,337 --> 01:05:34,904
I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!

1302
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:38,572
Fresh! Energetic!        I love his rawness!

1303
01:05:38,577 --> 01:05:42,004
Stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!

1304
01:05:42,314 --> 01:05:44,145
Yes, you are.        Bravo!

1305
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:47,179
I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!

1306
01:05:47,853 --> 01:05:50,346
Yes! Yes!

1307
01:05:59,564 --> 01:06:02,158
These braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.

1308
01:06:02,267 --> 01:06:04,062
Sweetie.        You know what, I'm sitting here thinking,

1309
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:07,232
"Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole

1310
01:06:07,305 --> 01:06:09,273
"and serve it to their husband?"

1311
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:12,777
You would.        You are being awful. What's wrong?

1312
01:06:12,844 --> 01:06:17,577
Captain took us off the case.        I'm sorry.

1313
01:06:18,483 --> 01:06:21,372
I told Terry about my dark days in college, 

1314
01:06:21,373 --> 01:06:23,584
and it brought up some feelings.

1315
01:06:23,722 --> 01:06:26,777
Well, honeydick, that was a long time ago. 

1316
01:06:27,406 --> 01:06:29,256
You're not that same person you were.

1317
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,596
No, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.

1318
01:06:32,597 --> 01:06:35,589
It wants to get out. It wants to walk around.

1319
01:06:35,667 --> 01:06:38,795
It wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.

1320
01:06:38,904 --> 01:06:41,484
And it wants to walk up with the people and say,

1321
01:06:41,485 --> 01:06:43,849
 "Hey, Gator don't play no shit. "

1322
01:06:43,884 --> 01:06:45,140
You feel me?        Yeah.

1323
01:06:45,243 --> 01:06:49,304
Gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.

1324
01:06:52,350 --> 01:06:54,341
Sweetie, I'm sorry.        It's okay.

1325
01:06:54,986 --> 01:06:58,353
I just...        Remember that night we met?

1326
01:06:59,124 --> 01:07:01,494
The attending physician told me, 

1327
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:04,189
"We got a drugged-out pimp in the back. "

1328
01:07:04,529 --> 01:07:07,965
And I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain,

1329
01:07:10,335 --> 01:07:13,217
You were weak, scared,

1330
01:07:13,238 --> 01:07:17,334
ass up, inflamed, crying.

1331
01:07:17,442 --> 01:07:19,152
At that moment, I knew. 

1332
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:22,540
"Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry. "

1333
01:07:23,515 --> 01:07:28,009
Pimps don't cry

1334
01:07:29,321 --> 01:07:31,846
Pimps don't cry

1335
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:34,858
No they do not

1336
01:07:35,227 --> 01:07:38,196
They don't shed a tear

1337
01:07:38,897 --> 01:07:44,233
Pimps don't cry

1338
01:07:44,502 --> 01:07:46,402
They never shed a tear

1339
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:52,679
Come lay with me. 

1340
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:54,746
Be safe, and let's make love. Come on.

1341
01:07:54,846 --> 01:07:57,246
Every time you say, "Be safe," it tears me apart.

1342
01:07:57,349 --> 01:07:59,909
You gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.

1343
01:08:01,519 --> 01:08:04,010
Allen, I'm pregnant.

1344
01:08:04,889 --> 01:08:06,254
Whose baby is that?

1345
01:08:06,358 --> 01:08:07,988
Who's the man who did that to you? 

1346
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,357
Gator's bitches better be using jimmies!

1347
01:08:11,663 --> 01:08:15,323
I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.

1348
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:16,725
Oh, my God.

1349
01:08:18,336 --> 01:08:19,735
You need to leave.

1350
01:08:19,838 --> 01:08:23,433
Get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!

1351
01:08:40,225 --> 01:08:41,123
Hey

1352
01:08:42,394 --> 01:08:44,919
Hey. What are you doing here?

1353
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,130
Come here when I have lady troubles, 

1354
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,463
which means I come here about every night.

1355
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:54,595
What are you doing here?

1356
01:08:55,774 --> 01:08:58,265
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

1357
01:08:59,144 --> 01:09:01,442
She threw me out.

1358
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,729
Well, you're not a cop 

1359
01:09:03,730 --> 01:09:05,541
till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.

1360
01:09:05,617 --> 01:09:07,627
Does it bother you that the Castien robbers 

1361
01:09:07,628 --> 01:09:09,953
only took 74 grand in diamonds?

1362
01:09:09,988 --> 01:09:12,256
They're junkies. Who cares? I mean...

1363
01:09:12,324 --> 01:09:16,124
I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.

1364
01:09:16,227 --> 01:09:17,675
How are you going?

1365
01:09:18,797 --> 01:09:21,960
We're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here

1366
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:23,261
if you wanna join us.

1367
01:09:23,368 --> 01:09:25,727
You're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?

1368
01:09:25,770 --> 01:09:28,637
Here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos

1369
01:09:29,074 --> 01:09:31,008
with fingers in each other's pooper

1370
01:09:31,076 --> 01:09:33,874
in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.

1371
01:09:33,945 --> 01:09:35,405
It's gonna be a nice evening.

1372
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:37,778
Well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.

1373
01:09:37,982 --> 01:09:39,074
Let me rephrase it.

1374
01:09:39,484 --> 01:09:42,317
We got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle,

1375
01:09:42,520 --> 01:09:45,833
and we're just get in there and we're gonna put some D's in some A's.

1376
01:09:46,024 --> 01:09:47,955
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?

1377
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:50,651
How do you know who we are?        You left a note in that car.

1378
01:09:50,662 --> 01:09:53,122
Police, shithead.        He's a copper. We gotta go. Come on!

1379
01:09:53,231 --> 01:09:55,452
Hey! Goose it, boys! They're cops!

1380
01:09:55,533 --> 01:09:57,296
Rub your dicks on the car as you're running away!

1381
01:09:57,369 --> 01:09:59,701
You turned my beautiful Prius into a nightmare!

1382
01:09:59,804 --> 01:10:03,467
We are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again!

1383
01:10:05,610 --> 01:10:07,305
I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight.

1384
01:10:07,379 --> 01:10:09,176
Fortunately, I know where you're gonna be drinking.

1385
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,612
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.

1386
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,845
No, I already have a beer.        No, no, no, no.

1387
01:10:14,185 --> 01:10:16,517
I'm talking about doing some serious drinking.

1388
01:10:16,621 --> 01:10:17,952
Drinking with Terry Hoitz.

1389
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:08,803
This sucks, man. Work our ass off on this case,

1390
01:11:08,823 --> 01:11:10,565
now we gotta hand over all of our evidence?

1391
01:11:10,592 --> 01:11:11,704
Yeah, it's not right.

1392
01:11:11,776 --> 01:11:13,835
Oh, my God, I'm hungover.

1393
01:11:16,181 --> 01:11:17,277
So, you guys are law enforcement?

1394
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:19,583
Yeah, we're an independent government agency who,

1395
01:11:19,651 --> 01:11:21,551
along with the FBI and the Federal Reserve,

1396
01:11:21,619 --> 01:11:24,240
regulate the stock market and corporate fraud.

1397
01:11:24,242 --> 01:11:27,050
And the Federal Reserve is a prison?

1398
01:11:27,051 --> 01:11:29,755
No, basically, it's a held-for-profit bank that sets interest rates

1399
01:11:29,828 --> 01:11:31,354
and loans money to other banks.

1400
01:11:31,796 --> 01:11:33,991
Is that a wastebasket?        Yeah, right there.

1401
01:11:34,098 --> 01:11:35,463
Thank you.

1402
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:40,501
You all right?        Holy hell!

1403
01:11:42,140 --> 01:11:43,835
I'm so sorry.

1404
01:11:44,442 --> 01:11:46,207
I got so drunk last night.

1405
01:11:46,210 --> 01:11:49,778
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste was astronaut food.

1406
01:11:50,849 --> 01:11:52,646
Come on in, fellas.

1407
01:11:53,751 --> 01:11:55,946
You gotta be kidding me. You're Ershon's lawyer.

1408
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:58,083
We're turning over our investigation to you?

1409
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,453
Let me assure you there will be no conflict of interestewx

1410
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:01,992
between me and David Ershon.

1411
01:12:02,093 --> 01:12:04,507
And if this were an actual investigation, 

1412
01:12:04,700 --> 01:12:06,540
I would immediately recuse myself.

1413
01:12:06,547 --> 01:12:08,935
This is all the evidence we have, 

1414
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,830
and I truly hope you take this seriously.

1415
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:12,212
Yes. Very much so.

1416
01:12:12,213 --> 01:12:13,766
From everything I've heard, I understand

1417
01:12:13,838 --> 01:12:17,103
you guys are the best at these types of investigations.

1418
01:12:17,175 --> 01:12:20,239
Outside of Enron and AIG

1419
01:12:20,241 --> 01:12:21,878
and Bernie Madoff,

1420
01:12:22,113 --> 01:12:24,809
WorldCom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.

1421
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:26,783
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.

1422
01:12:26,851 --> 01:12:28,648
Would you like a seat, or you're fine?        No, I'm good.

1423
01:12:28,720 --> 01:12:30,747
Okay. Let me just assure you fellas,

1424
01:12:30,822 --> 01:12:34,213
David Ershon is an upstanding citizen.

1425
01:12:34,258 --> 01:12:36,221
I am playing squash with him tonight at the club,

1426
01:12:36,224 --> 01:12:37,224
and we're having dinner.

1427
01:12:37,295 --> 01:12:39,388
You listen to me, you Windsor knot-wearing monkey,

1428
01:12:39,497 --> 01:12:41,556
you play squash with Ershon, right?

1429
01:12:41,666 --> 01:12:43,348
Your kids go to school with his? 

1430
01:12:43,349 --> 01:12:44,898
How would you know if he's clean or not?

1431
01:12:45,003 --> 01:12:46,664
I will take a look at your evidence,

1432
01:12:46,738 --> 01:12:48,566
and I will take a second look at the financials.

1433
01:12:48,673 --> 01:12:50,732
And when I come back and bust your ass,

1434
01:12:50,842 --> 01:12:53,633
we're locking David Ershon in the Federal Reserve!

1435
01:12:53,634 --> 01:12:55,238
He still doesn't understand the concept.

1436
01:13:16,301 --> 01:13:17,825
What are you doing?

1437
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:20,249
We just handed all of our evidence over 

1438
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,669
to the bad guy's lawyer!

1439
01:13:21,739 --> 01:13:24,003
Are you a big man, huh?

1440
01:13:24,075 --> 01:13:25,542
I'm talking to you.        What?

1441
01:13:25,710 --> 01:13:26,990
You wake up in the morning, you say, 

1442
01:13:26,991 --> 01:13:28,475
"I'm putting on my big boy pants"?

1443
01:13:28,546 --> 01:13:29,774
"Look, I'm wearing a belt!

1444
01:13:29,881 --> 01:13:32,008
"I've got big boy pants on!"        No!

1445
01:13:32,250 --> 01:13:34,013
You borrow a little jacket, you go?

1446
01:13:34,218 --> 01:13:36,277
You take your lunch 'cause you got big boy pants on?

1447
01:13:36,788 --> 01:13:38,619
You got your big boy pants and your snack?

1448
01:13:39,390 --> 01:13:41,017
I could say big, loud things!

1449
01:13:41,526 --> 01:13:42,925
I could be demonstrative!

1450
01:13:43,261 --> 01:13:45,605
Stop!        We don't, we don't do this!

1451
01:13:45,606 --> 01:13:47,356
You're scaring the shit out of me, man! Stop it!

1452
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:50,662
Is this how you conduct yourself? In a democracy?

1453
01:13:50,768 --> 01:13:52,429
What the hell are you doing, man?

1454
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:57,273
I'm so tired of you getting angry and yelling all the time.

1455
01:13:58,176 --> 01:13:59,837
It's exhausting.

1456
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,845
I feel like I'm partners with the Hulk.

1457
01:14:04,282 --> 01:14:06,773
You wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?

1458
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:10,218
'Cause the more I try and do right, the more I screw things up.

1459
01:14:10,955 --> 01:14:15,983
We've got a possible jumper at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.

1460
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,424
All units, fire department, en route.

1461
01:14:18,446 --> 01:14:20,783
SEC.        Beaman's office.

1462
01:14:21,099 --> 01:14:22,457
We have to go.

1463
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:24,450
But the Captain.        We have to go, Allen.

1464
01:14:24,452 --> 01:14:26,219
All units, I need a respondent. 

1465
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,902
Possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.

1466
01:14:40,051 --> 01:14:42,246
Shit. It's Beaman!

1467
01:14:43,054 --> 01:14:45,887
He's gotta know something.        Wesley!

1468
01:14:46,157 --> 01:14:47,988
Detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.

1469
01:14:48,426 --> 01:14:51,219
I took an online class at University of Phoenix on negotiating.

1470
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:53,256
I'm gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.

1471
01:14:53,364 --> 01:14:55,730
I got no bullhorn.        Does anyone have a bullhorn?

1472
01:14:55,833 --> 01:14:58,028
Bullhorn, anyone?        Truck.

1473
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:01,061
Police business. I need to use your PA system.

1474
01:15:01,172 --> 01:15:02,400
Okay, let me turn it on.

1475
01:15:04,342 --> 01:15:07,175
Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?

1476
01:15:07,245 --> 01:15:10,442
It's Wesley. I know Ershon's Wesley's...

1477
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:13,381
Look, there's a lot to live for in this life.

1478
01:15:13,451 --> 01:15:18,514
A lot of great things, like soda pop, big fresh can of soda pop.

1479
01:15:18,589 --> 01:15:19,954
They do not care!

1480
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:22,356
Give me this. I know how to talk to him.

1481
01:15:22,427 --> 01:15:26,390
Listen, we all know you're a scumbag, and nobody cares about you.

1482
01:15:26,397 --> 01:15:27,928
Rotten piece of shit.

1483
01:15:27,930 --> 01:15:29,566
That's worse than what I was saying.

1484
01:15:29,967 --> 01:15:31,559
I'm not gonna lie to you, Don.

1485
01:15:31,636 --> 01:15:34,006
People down here are starting to murmur 

1486
01:15:34,007 --> 01:15:36,003
that you don't have the balls to do it.

1487
01:15:36,003 --> 01:15:37,798
I don't care!        Yeah.

1488
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:40,241
I say you can do it.

1489
01:15:40,978 --> 01:15:43,634
I mean, I don't want you to jump. 

1490
01:15:43,635 --> 01:15:45,795
I'm just saying you have the capability.

1491
01:15:45,830 --> 01:15:46,641
Look, he's flying!

1492
01:15:52,390 --> 01:15:53,618
Stop that.

1493
01:15:54,392 --> 01:15:56,557
Half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.

1494
01:15:56,558 --> 01:15:58,451
Look at this, it's a clear sign of a struggle.

1495
01:15:58,500 --> 01:15:59,790
 Make sure you get this, all right?

1496
01:16:00,198 --> 01:16:03,065
Detectives, all your work's done here. You can go.

1497
01:16:03,134 --> 01:16:04,776
What about Ershon targeting the lottery?

1498
01:16:04,802 --> 01:16:06,793
You know why Ershon was calling down 

1499
01:16:06,794 --> 01:16:08,967
to the lottery offices all those times?

1500
01:16:09,073 --> 01:16:11,064
Because he was hooking up with the Powerball girl,

1501
01:16:11,142 --> 01:16:13,440
the one on TV with all the numbered balls.

1502
01:16:13,544 --> 01:16:16,135
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him last week.

1503
01:16:16,214 --> 01:16:18,045
It was right there in front of you the whole time.

1504
01:16:18,116 --> 01:16:20,084
Can't be.        You guys are getting transferred.

1505
01:16:20,151 --> 01:16:22,278
What?        Traffic.

1506
01:16:22,386 --> 01:16:23,648
Yeah, that's right.

1507
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:25,988
You, you're gonna walk a beat downtown. 

1508
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,252
You're gonna walk a beat downtown.

1509
01:16:27,325 --> 01:16:28,917
It's done. No.        Captain, what are you talking about?

1510
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:29,732
No, no. It's done.

1511
01:16:29,761 --> 01:16:31,826
Save yourselves some gas.        Captain!

1512
01:16:32,163 --> 01:16:33,562
Is there an appeal process we can...

1513
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:36,794
Had to do what you had to do, Captain.

1514
01:16:36,901 --> 01:16:39,096
Wow! That hurt.

1515
01:16:41,239 --> 01:16:43,400
Excuse me. Where's my car?        They towed it.

1516
01:16:43,474 --> 01:16:45,942
Couple of homeless people were messing around in it.

1517
01:16:46,010 --> 01:16:49,673
That's an official police car.        Could have fooled me.

1518
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,116
Wow, Mauch was upset, huh?

1519
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:57,814
Really?

1520
01:16:57,922 --> 01:16:59,677
The only thing I had to be proud of in my life

1521
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:00,569
 was being a detective.

1522
01:17:00,570 --> 01:17:02,918
That was all I had. Now it's gone.

1523
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:06,152
I know. I know. You still got me.

1524
01:17:06,264 --> 01:17:09,791
Don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.

1525
01:17:09,867 --> 01:17:12,097
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.

1526
01:17:12,436 --> 01:17:14,655
I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.

1527
01:17:14,690 --> 01:17:17,313
It's a real case, and I'm a real cop. 

1528
01:17:17,314 --> 01:17:19,176
We just got the wrong target for Ershon.

1529
01:17:19,277 --> 01:17:21,907
You carry a rape whistle.        This is real cop work.

1530
01:17:21,908 --> 01:17:24,445
There is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?

1531
01:17:24,515 --> 01:17:28,251
You got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.

1532
01:17:28,252 --> 01:17:29,611
Leave me alone.

1533
01:17:30,221 --> 01:17:31,711
A mutt case.

1534
01:17:31,823 --> 01:17:34,348
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?

1535
01:17:34,458 --> 01:17:36,619
A broken partnership.

1536
01:17:36,694 --> 01:17:37,820
I'm a cop!

1537
01:17:37,895 --> 01:17:41,558
And getting busted down to a shitty assignment.

1538
01:17:41,666 --> 01:17:44,726
Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.

1539
01:17:47,505 --> 01:17:50,565
But sometimes when you get your ass kicked,

1540
01:17:51,809 --> 01:17:54,505
that's when you find out what's real...

1541
01:17:56,848 --> 01:17:58,873
...and what needs doing.

1542
01:18:04,822 --> 01:18:06,881
Whether it's directing traffic...

1543
01:18:06,991 --> 01:18:08,015
Come on!

1544
01:18:08,492 --> 01:18:11,928
...or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.

1545
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,600
Do you work here?        Yeah, I do.

1546
01:18:25,606 --> 01:18:28,409
The wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.

1547
01:18:28,512 --> 01:18:30,170
They also did damage to your office?

1548
01:18:30,181 --> 01:18:32,706
Some police officers came by and sealed it off.

1549
01:18:32,783 --> 01:18:34,114
Do you recall what they looked like?

1550
01:18:34,218 --> 01:18:36,914
One of them had an Australian accent.

1551
01:18:37,455 --> 01:18:41,255
You don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?

1552
01:18:41,359 --> 01:18:44,726
No. Our main client is Lendl Global.

1553
01:18:44,795 --> 01:18:46,422
Can I ask what this is about?

1554
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,000
TRAFFIC ENFORCER OF THE MONTH

1555
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,000
Terry Hoitz

1556
01:18:59,877 --> 01:19:02,347
Gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!

1557
01:19:11,489 --> 01:19:13,582
'Cause that's what a real cop is.

1558
01:19:13,658 --> 01:19:16,349
No, I didn't say "Lock her up. " I never said, "Lock her up. "

1559
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:19,058
A guy who does what needs to be done.

1560
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:23,089
A guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.

1561
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:24,794
And then you move to Florida.

1562
01:19:34,111 --> 01:19:35,237
One, two, three, attack!

1563
01:19:37,949 --> 01:19:39,143
Terry, it's me.

1564
01:19:39,250 --> 01:19:41,480
Tap out. Tap out.        It's me, Allen.

1565
01:19:41,585 --> 01:19:43,143
Are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?

1566
01:19:43,254 --> 01:19:44,915
I'm tapping out!

1567
01:19:45,790 --> 01:19:48,816
You crazy? What are you doing, man?

1568
01:19:48,926 --> 01:19:50,359
They might be watching us.        Could've killed you.

1569
01:19:50,461 --> 01:19:51,957
Turn out the lights.        What?

1570
01:19:51,962 --> 01:19:52,854
They could be watching us.        Who?

1571
01:19:53,097 --> 01:19:55,622
I found some big information, okay?

1572
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:58,828
About what?        Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.

1573
01:19:59,136 --> 01:20:01,934
How'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.

1574
01:20:02,006 --> 01:20:04,474
We can't be too careful.        What are you talking about?

1575
01:20:04,542 --> 01:20:07,705
This place might be bugged.        There's no bugs in here.

1576
01:20:11,983 --> 01:20:14,975
First off, I missed you.

1577
01:20:15,052 --> 01:20:17,850
What's going on?        Did you hear what I said?

1578
01:20:17,955 --> 01:20:21,948
Fine, I kind of missed you, too.        Thank you.

1579
01:20:22,026 --> 01:20:26,326
Okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.

1580
01:20:26,397 --> 01:20:28,695
It's Lendl Global.        What?

1581
01:20:28,799 --> 01:20:31,324
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction

1582
01:20:31,402 --> 01:20:34,394
so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.

1583
01:20:34,505 --> 01:20:37,702
They then altered all the records to cover the losses

1584
01:20:37,808 --> 01:20:40,572
that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.

1585
01:20:40,811 --> 01:20:42,419
You're not supposed to be doing this. 

1586
01:20:43,005 --> 01:20:44,518
You're supposed to be walking the beat.

1587
01:20:44,553 --> 01:20:47,109
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?

1588
01:20:47,318 --> 01:20:49,343
This is bad, Allen. This is bad.

1589
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:51,888
No wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.

1590
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:54,382
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.

1591
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:56,159
That's why they killed him.        Man.

1592
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:57,387
Here's the other thing.

1593
01:20:57,495 --> 01:20:59,486
Tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.

1594
01:20:59,697 --> 01:21:01,062
Ershon's leading it.

1595
01:21:01,165 --> 01:21:02,371
I still can't figure out 

1596
01:21:02,372 --> 01:21:04,033
who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with,

1597
01:21:04,101 --> 01:21:05,261
but we gotta stop it.

1598
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:07,030
It's time to let the peacock fly.

1599
01:21:08,072 --> 01:21:09,937
I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.

1600
01:21:10,374 --> 01:21:12,501
So do I. We're cops.

1601
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:17,454
No. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.

1602
01:21:17,455 --> 01:21:18,238
What?

1603
01:21:18,849 --> 01:21:22,665
I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.

1604
01:21:22,720 --> 01:21:25,211
What is this traffic bullshit?

1605
01:21:29,026 --> 01:21:32,553
What are you talking about?        I'm talking about my life.

1606
01:21:32,630 --> 01:21:35,780
The corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.

1607
01:21:35,781 --> 01:21:39,270
It's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.

1608
01:21:39,276 --> 01:21:42,262
There's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.

1609
01:21:42,373 --> 01:21:43,933
You've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.

1610
01:21:43,934 --> 01:21:46,545
What happened to you? What happened to this being our time?

1611
01:21:46,546 --> 01:21:48,705
No way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.

1612
01:21:49,947 --> 01:21:52,814
Get in the car.        Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.

1613
01:21:54,385 --> 01:21:58,219
Apartment pop. Now get in the car.        You're not gonna shoot me.

1614
01:21:58,289 --> 01:22:01,144
Okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.

1615
01:22:01,148 --> 01:22:02,352
So stop pointing it at me.

1616
01:22:02,376 --> 01:22:06,787
Look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?

1617
01:22:06,788 --> 01:22:07,840
For what? He doesn't care.

1618
01:22:07,898 --> 01:22:11,061
He's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.

1619
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:13,399
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.

1620
01:22:13,471 --> 01:22:16,269
Turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.

1621
01:22:16,941 --> 01:22:18,306
I hope I'm not alone.

1622
01:22:19,110 --> 01:22:21,635
Hope you bring it.

1623
01:22:23,347 --> 01:22:25,474
We got a big day out there. Big one.

1624
01:22:25,583 --> 01:22:28,474
We got a full moon. People are gonna be amped, all right?

1625
01:22:28,502 --> 01:22:30,943
Let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?

1626
01:22:32,490 --> 01:22:33,982
The new bathmats are in.

1627
01:22:36,427 --> 01:22:40,625
One more thing. We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.

1628
01:22:40,698 --> 01:22:44,190
Jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.

1629
01:22:44,301 --> 01:22:45,461
Well, don't ignore it.

1630
01:22:45,536 --> 01:22:48,767
If you live in Crown Heights, you know, walk in pairs.

1631
01:22:48,839 --> 01:22:51,122
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.

1632
01:22:51,123 --> 01:22:53,174
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories. 

1633
01:22:53,277 --> 01:22:56,872
I gotta go. Go get 'em. Let's be careful out there.

1634
01:22:58,949 --> 01:23:00,109
The oak.

1635
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:04,131
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?

1636
01:23:04,132 --> 01:23:05,379
And these chopping boards?

1637
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:06,214
Hey, Captain.

1638
01:23:07,658 --> 01:23:10,183
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?

1639
01:23:10,294 --> 01:23:12,207
What are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?

1640
01:23:12,563 --> 01:23:16,226
I need you to be straight with me.        Straight with us.

1641
01:23:16,333 --> 01:23:19,029
Hey, Terry. Look at this.

1642
01:23:19,136 --> 01:23:22,799
I thought you were working traffic today.        Let them block the box.

1643
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:26,665
Besides, partners' code, right?        Thanks.

1644
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:30,906
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?

1645
01:23:32,249 --> 01:23:35,343
All right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.

1646
01:23:35,419 --> 01:23:38,718
You really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.

1647
01:23:38,822 --> 01:23:40,756
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups,

1648
01:23:40,858 --> 01:23:44,145
and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?

1649
01:23:44,361 --> 01:23:46,522
You keep hiding from shit in the world,

1650
01:23:46,597 --> 01:23:49,211
and eventually the world comes to your front door.

1651
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:51,663
Nice.        That's very nice.

1652
01:23:51,669 --> 01:23:53,727
I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.

1653
01:23:53,771 --> 01:23:55,423
You keep this thing real quiet, 

1654
01:23:55,505 --> 01:23:57,765
and you make sure you have real evidence,

1655
01:23:57,875 --> 01:23:59,733
and maybe I'll see what I can do.

1656
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:00,737
But if you make a lot of noise

1657
01:24:00,844 --> 01:24:04,007
and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,

1658
01:24:04,081 --> 01:24:05,905
I am out, okay?

1659
01:24:05,949 --> 01:24:07,046
Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.

1660
01:24:07,117 --> 01:24:10,783
But there's one case, one case in a career 

1661
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,810
where you go all in. This is it.

1662
01:24:13,290 --> 01:24:16,623
All right. Then you do us proud.

1663
01:24:17,127 --> 01:24:18,574
'Cause I don't want no scrubs.

1664
01:24:19,129 --> 01:24:21,689
Really?        No.

1665
01:24:21,765 --> 01:24:23,857
You're not aware that's a TLC song?

1666
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,443
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1667
01:24:25,478 --> 01:24:26,768
Second time.        You said chasing waterfalls,

1668
01:24:26,870 --> 01:24:28,030
now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.

1669
01:24:28,105 --> 01:24:29,902
I don't even understand the reference.        It's like a tic.

1670
01:24:29,974 --> 01:24:31,100
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1671
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:33,872
Remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.

1672
01:24:33,911 --> 01:24:35,606
You can trust us.        Real quiet.

1673
01:24:35,713 --> 01:24:38,177
You gotta creep. Creep.

1674
01:24:38,249 --> 01:24:39,546
Come on.

1675
01:24:40,484 --> 01:24:41,815
You don't say "Creep-creep" 

1676
01:24:41,816 --> 01:24:43,455
unless you're quoting TLC.

1677
01:24:43,456 --> 01:24:44,619
Hey, guys.

1678
01:24:45,589 --> 01:24:47,754
You know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?

1679
01:24:48,125 --> 01:24:49,922
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.

1680
01:24:49,994 --> 01:24:51,894
I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?

1681
01:24:52,229 --> 01:24:55,692
Not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.

1682
01:24:56,834 --> 01:24:58,392
You ready?

1683
01:24:58,469 --> 01:25:00,130
Yeah.        Let's go.

1684
01:25:08,646 --> 01:25:11,012
No, but the highlights are great.        Thank you.

1685
01:25:11,115 --> 01:25:13,274
Sexy but serious.        Thank you.

1686
01:25:13,284 --> 01:25:14,649
Excuse me.

1687
01:25:15,653 --> 01:25:18,315
Who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.

1688
01:25:18,422 --> 01:25:22,916
You know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.

1689
01:25:23,503 --> 01:25:24,485
Who are they?

1690
01:25:25,596 --> 01:25:30,295
Well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.

1691
01:25:30,367 --> 01:25:36,203
And the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.

1692
01:25:36,307 --> 01:25:39,042
You owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?

1693
01:25:39,043 --> 01:25:40,319
Yes. Yes, I do.

1694
01:25:40,327 --> 01:25:43,340
You're a piece of work.        Thank you.

1695
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:46,881
Probably best to get started.

1696
01:25:47,318 --> 01:25:50,776
This is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.

1697
01:25:50,854 --> 01:25:52,078
The only thing that bugs me is

1698
01:25:52,079 --> 01:25:53,790
 we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.

1699
01:25:53,857 --> 01:25:56,172
Is it the lotto? Who is it?

1700
01:25:56,173 --> 01:25:58,354
Who cares? Some rich prick.

1701
01:25:58,354 --> 01:26:04,089
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.

1702
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:06,636
And I can assure you that every dime of your money

1703
01:26:06,637 --> 01:26:09,903
will be invested with the utmost diligence.

1704
01:26:09,904 --> 01:26:11,708
Your rates of return are really exciting.

1705
01:26:11,809 --> 01:26:13,333
We think our members are gonna be just thrilled.

1706
01:26:13,410 --> 01:26:17,944
Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.

1707
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:20,544
All right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.

1708
01:26:20,651 --> 01:26:22,985
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.

1709
01:26:22,986 --> 01:26:24,044
Beautiful.

1710
01:26:24,154 --> 01:26:25,553
All right, listen up.

1711
01:26:25,656 --> 01:26:28,557
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.

1712
01:26:28,659 --> 01:26:30,820
We need your cooperation.

1713
01:26:30,894 --> 01:26:32,361
David Ershon.

1714
01:26:32,429 --> 01:26:34,761
You're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement,

1715
01:26:34,865 --> 01:26:36,960
and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.

1716
01:26:37,067 --> 01:26:38,500
This is a bad idea.

1717
01:26:39,002 --> 01:26:40,367
Hey, guys.

1718
01:26:41,939 --> 01:26:44,407
Bob? What are you doing here?

1719
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,206
I'm investing.

1720
01:26:46,276 --> 01:26:49,010
Do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?

1721
01:26:49,011 --> 01:26:50,756
This is what it was for.        Holy shit.

1722
01:26:50,757 --> 01:26:53,239
It's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.

1723
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:57,349
Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.

1724
01:27:03,694 --> 01:27:07,793
Gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.

1725
01:27:08,232 --> 01:27:10,299
We are within our rights to take action.

1726
01:28:08,091 --> 01:28:10,108
So much for quiet as church mice!

1727
01:28:10,461 --> 01:28:11,553
Go!

1728
01:28:16,700 --> 01:28:18,065
Who the hell are those guys?

1729
01:28:18,135 --> 01:28:18,682
Gentlemen, 

1730
01:28:18,683 --> 01:28:21,196
I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.

1731
01:28:21,271 --> 01:28:23,081
Even I admit that's not very tempting, 

1732
01:28:23,082 --> 01:28:25,231
but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!

1733
01:28:25,309 --> 01:28:27,543
Get in the front!        How do you start this freaking thing?

1734
01:28:27,544 --> 01:28:28,533
Go on! Go!

1735
01:28:29,279 --> 01:28:30,628
Shit!        Go!

1736
01:28:32,749 --> 01:28:33,738
Oh, my...

1737
01:28:35,152 --> 01:28:38,499
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!

1738
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:25,590
Hold the wheel!

1739
01:29:31,308 --> 01:29:33,674
Open the back!        I got it. I got it!

1740
01:29:41,685 --> 01:29:44,620
They're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.

1741
01:29:44,721 --> 01:29:47,121
Well, I'm gonna kill you first!        And then they will kill me.

1742
01:29:47,224 --> 01:29:50,250
We have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous,

1743
01:29:50,360 --> 01:29:52,021
and holding David Ershon hostage.        Stupid pricks!

1744
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:55,667
It's us, we're good guys!        Exactly. They're the good guys.

1745
01:29:55,668 --> 01:29:57,860
Where do we go? Where do we go?

1746
01:29:57,935 --> 01:30:00,597
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.

1747
01:30:00,704 --> 01:30:03,400
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.

1748
01:30:03,473 --> 01:30:05,896
Not at the same time. That would be wrong.

1749
01:30:08,812 --> 01:30:11,508
Let's hear it from the top, every detail.

1750
01:30:12,082 --> 01:30:13,954
I think the best way to tell the story is 

1751
01:30:14,300 --> 01:30:16,973
by starting at the end, briefly,

1752
01:30:16,974 --> 01:30:19,214
then going back to the beginning, 

1753
01:30:19,702 --> 01:30:22,009
and then periodically returning to the end,

1754
01:30:22,044 --> 01:30:24,952
maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.

1755
01:30:25,062 --> 01:30:26,866
Just to give it a bit of dynamism, 

1756
01:30:26,867 --> 01:30:28,431
otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.

1757
01:30:28,432 --> 01:30:29,592
Just tell us what happened.

1758
01:30:29,700 --> 01:30:31,602
I lost a bunch of money from some people 

1759
01:30:31,603 --> 01:30:32,878
and now they want it back.

1760
01:30:32,913 --> 01:30:34,066
What about Don Beaman?

1761
01:30:34,137 --> 01:30:36,728
Beaman knew that I had falsified my financials,

1762
01:30:36,740 --> 01:30:39,438
so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.

1763
01:30:39,743 --> 01:30:41,798
He forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin

1764
01:30:41,799 --> 01:30:43,937
and then forced him onto the ledge.

1765
01:30:43,938 --> 01:30:45,543
It was only a matter of time before he fell.

1766
01:30:45,616 --> 01:30:49,052
At least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.

1767
01:30:49,119 --> 01:30:52,434
Well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.

1768
01:30:52,456 --> 01:30:55,650
By 9:00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund

1769
01:30:55,651 --> 01:30:57,921
and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.

1770
01:30:57,928 --> 01:30:59,452
By 9:01, it's gone.

1771
01:30:59,563 --> 01:31:02,555
Well, what if we stop the transfer?        But you can't.

1772
01:31:02,633 --> 01:31:05,101
What if we stop the transfer?

1773
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,529
You'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9:00 exactly,

1774
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:10,696
find the clerk, get the routing number.

1775
01:31:10,697 --> 01:31:11,732
We gotta stop it.

1776
01:31:11,808 --> 01:31:13,002
There's no way.

1777
01:31:13,110 --> 01:31:15,505
Every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, 

1778
01:31:15,640 --> 01:31:16,731
they'll all be after us.

1779
01:31:16,813 --> 01:31:21,059
You could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.

1780
01:31:21,518 --> 01:31:24,578
It's not a bribe.        Of course it's a bribe.

1781
01:31:24,655 --> 01:31:27,082
You're offering to pay us money to not do our job.

1782
01:31:28,859 --> 01:31:30,121
It's not a bribe.

1783
01:31:30,761 --> 01:31:33,161
We hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.

1784
01:31:33,263 --> 01:31:35,302
We'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.

1785
01:31:35,766 --> 01:31:37,460
First things first, I gotta go see Sheila.

1786
01:31:37,511 --> 01:31:38,766
No way, it's too dangerous.

1787
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:41,167
Look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow,

1788
01:31:41,271 --> 01:31:44,798
but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.

1789
01:31:45,308 --> 01:31:47,608
All right, go. Go. Be careful.

1790
01:31:47,678 --> 01:31:49,305
Thanks, I will.

1791
01:31:50,147 --> 01:31:51,375
Will you say hi to Sheila for me?

1792
01:31:51,548 --> 01:31:53,311
Okay.        Okay.

1793
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:56,352
Tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.

1794
01:31:56,453 --> 01:31:57,886
He wants to make sure you know

1795
01:31:57,988 --> 01:32:00,354
that he'll be there for you if anything happens.

1796
01:32:00,457 --> 01:32:02,516
Yeah.        Drop of a hat, I'm there.

1797
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:04,717
Look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.

1798
01:32:04,828 --> 01:32:07,729
If something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.

1799
01:32:07,831 --> 01:32:10,872
All of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.

1800
01:32:10,874 --> 01:32:12,995
Why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?

1801
01:32:13,203 --> 01:32:14,568
Just go, man.

1802
01:32:15,305 --> 01:32:17,195
Okay. Thanks.

1803
01:32:17,741 --> 01:32:18,833
Go.

1804
01:32:22,813 --> 01:32:24,073
Janeco Gallery.

1805
01:32:24,915 --> 01:32:27,008
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.

1806
01:32:37,728 --> 01:32:38,888
Please pick up.

1807
01:32:39,763 --> 01:32:40,923
Hello.

1808
01:32:41,031 --> 01:32:44,194
Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.

1809
01:32:44,267 --> 01:32:47,902
You know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.

1810
01:32:47,903 --> 01:32:50,362
Baby, where are you? I wanna see you.

1811
01:32:50,373 --> 01:32:53,034
I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.

1812
01:32:53,035 --> 01:32:53,967
Do you remember?

1813
01:32:54,611 --> 01:32:56,010
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1814
01:32:56,079 --> 01:32:57,296
I'm just warning you, though.

1815
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,112
 Watch out. I think they're watching the house.

1816
01:33:00,147 --> 01:33:02,477
Don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.

1817
01:33:02,919 --> 01:33:06,855
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...

1818
01:33:08,024 --> 01:33:11,460
After all those years, after the restraining order.

1819
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:14,928
I was worried I might not see you again.

1820
01:33:15,031 --> 01:33:16,623
There's some very dangerous people after him,

1821
01:33:16,733 --> 01:33:18,157
and now they're after us.

1822
01:33:20,971 --> 01:33:22,370
It's just the old lady.

1823
01:33:27,944 --> 01:33:29,377
Hello, Allen.

1824
01:33:29,446 --> 01:33:32,040
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?

1825
01:33:32,115 --> 01:33:35,859
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.

1826
01:33:36,553 --> 01:33:38,418
She also says...        Yes.

1827
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:42,322
...she wants you on top of her, holding her hair,

1828
01:33:42,425 --> 01:33:44,850
and riding her like a bucking bronco

1829
01:33:45,095 --> 01:33:49,024
while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey. "

1830
01:33:49,566 --> 01:33:51,524
You, you tell your daughter...

1831
01:33:51,525 --> 01:33:53,935
He said he'll always love you.

1832
01:33:54,004 --> 01:33:56,666
And he's so happy that you're having his child.

1833
01:33:56,773 --> 01:33:57,933
Allen.

1834
01:33:58,008 --> 01:33:59,839
He also says that

1835
01:33:59,943 --> 01:34:02,706
he wants you to stare into each other's eyes 

1836
01:34:02,707 --> 01:34:04,711
without blinking while you do it.

1837
01:34:04,714 --> 01:34:07,234
I love when we do that, Mom.        And then afterward,

1838
01:34:07,517 --> 01:34:09,485
lick the sex off each other.

1839
01:34:11,054 --> 01:34:12,954
I don't wanna do this.

1840
01:34:14,357 --> 01:34:16,606
You say things that are too personal.

1841
01:34:16,607 --> 01:34:18,383
Okay, but just one more thing.

1842
01:34:18,384 --> 01:34:20,028
She said she loves you,

1843
01:34:20,096 --> 01:34:23,490
and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.

1844
01:34:23,867 --> 01:34:26,712
Come on. That's not all she said.

1845
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:28,064
No.

1846
01:34:29,139 --> 01:34:32,734
She says other things, but I don't want...        Please, please, please.

1847
01:34:32,809 --> 01:34:35,223
You don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.

1848
01:34:35,545 --> 01:34:36,739
Okay.

1849
01:34:39,282 --> 01:34:44,451
She says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones

1850
01:34:44,452 --> 01:34:47,752
and have a three-day F marathon.        That's more like it. Yeah.

1851
01:34:47,757 --> 01:34:52,962
She wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.

1852
01:34:52,963 --> 01:34:54,191
That's just lovely.

1853
01:34:54,598 --> 01:34:58,227
No more! He says things I can't say.

1854
01:34:58,301 --> 01:35:00,653
It involves a mannequin hand 

1855
01:35:00,654 --> 01:35:04,270
and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.

1856
01:35:12,616 --> 01:35:13,674
Now what'd she say?

1857
01:35:16,152 --> 01:35:17,915
She says she loves you.

1858
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,492
I'm so sorry about everything.

1859
01:35:27,500 --> 01:35:31,902
And I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.

1860
01:35:32,300 --> 01:35:35,771
And the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that

1861
01:35:37,440 --> 01:35:41,501
I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning

1862
01:35:41,611 --> 01:35:44,409
and intelligent and wonderful you are,

1863
01:35:45,282 --> 01:35:49,466
I'd just lose you.        Shut up, Allen. I love you.

1864
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:52,417
We have a place that's safe. All right.

1865
01:36:04,968 --> 01:36:06,196
I'm gonna break your hip.

1866
01:36:14,978 --> 01:36:17,876
I'm about to do you grandpa-style.

1867
01:36:23,900 --> 01:36:27,100


1868
01:36:32,696 --> 01:36:34,323
I brought some music.

1869
01:36:38,835 --> 01:36:40,826
Not what I would've chosen, but screw it.

1870
01:36:40,904 --> 01:36:44,169
All right. Let's go, Monday morning, time to go to work.

1871
01:36:44,240 --> 01:36:45,416
Let's do it.

1872
01:36:45,475 --> 01:36:47,204
You want my gate code?        Shut up, man!

1873
01:36:54,751 --> 01:36:55,843
That's Wesley!

1874
01:37:06,896 --> 01:37:07,988
Yes!

1875
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,925
Where'd you learn to drive like that?        Grand Theft Auto!

1876
01:37:15,872 --> 01:37:17,150
Shit, Allen, they're coming.

1877
01:37:20,010 --> 01:37:22,570
Oh, my God!        Shit.

1878
01:37:23,847 --> 01:37:26,102
Do something, Allen!        Hold on, hold on.

1879
01:37:47,037 --> 01:37:48,934
Someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.

1880
01:37:50,607 --> 01:37:51,938
I did that!

1881
01:37:52,042 --> 01:37:53,703
I did that!        Oh, my God!

1882
01:37:53,777 --> 01:37:56,125
That's what I'm talking about!        We jackknifed them!

1883
01:37:56,146 --> 01:37:58,637
Did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.

1884
01:37:58,748 --> 01:38:00,795
Gator turns vans upside-down 

1885
01:38:00,796 --> 01:38:02,510
like they're in a crazy washing machine!

1886
01:38:02,519 --> 01:38:05,103
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

1887
01:38:05,121 --> 01:38:07,685
It's a nickname I had in college. I used to run a dating service.

1888
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:10,954
He was a pimp.        Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.

1889
01:38:11,094 --> 01:38:13,562
Is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?

1890
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:15,723
My poor car.

1891
01:38:16,066 --> 01:38:18,534
Right now the streets are a bloodbath.

1892
01:38:18,635 --> 01:38:21,679
And, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here,

1893
01:38:21,838 --> 01:38:24,129
10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.

1894
01:38:24,140 --> 01:38:27,200
Got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.

1895
01:38:27,310 --> 01:38:30,902
One, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.

1896
01:38:30,903 --> 01:38:33,878
It's a good tip.        Yeah. Two...

1897
01:38:33,983 --> 01:38:35,380
Gentlemen, we got a hot one.

1898
01:38:35,381 --> 01:38:39,150
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.

1899
01:38:39,155 --> 01:38:41,143
Yes! Gun, gun!

1900
01:38:41,144 --> 01:38:43,158
Pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.

1901
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:44,786
There we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?

1902
01:38:44,861 --> 01:38:46,594
Good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?

1903
01:38:46,595 --> 01:38:47,829
I do!

1904
01:38:48,331 --> 01:38:49,696
All right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.

1905
01:38:49,799 --> 01:38:51,493
Move! Let's go.        Come on!

1906
01:39:01,544 --> 01:39:04,788
Cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.

1907
01:39:09,686 --> 01:39:11,051
Jesus!

1908
01:39:15,892 --> 01:39:18,890
Who are those guys?        They're Chechen investors.

1909
01:39:18,891 --> 01:39:21,821
We were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.

1910
01:39:21,898 --> 01:39:24,190
Anyway, it went terribly wrong.

1911
01:39:26,669 --> 01:39:29,164
I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!

1912
01:39:29,873 --> 01:39:30,931
Oh, no.

1913
01:39:32,342 --> 01:39:33,400
Damn it.

1914
01:39:37,280 --> 01:39:40,048
Watch your head. God, your hair is soft.

1915
01:39:40,049 --> 01:39:41,682
VO5 Hot Oil.

1916
01:39:44,621 --> 01:39:47,159
You're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!

1917
01:39:47,160 --> 01:39:48,345
I'm not gonna wreck!

1918
01:39:50,093 --> 01:39:52,156
I'm gonna wreck! You're right!        You want me to drive?

1919
01:40:11,881 --> 01:40:14,543
This was a very clever idea.        Yeah.

1920
01:40:26,629 --> 01:40:27,926
They're gone.

1921
01:40:29,332 --> 01:40:30,424
Let's go.

1922
01:40:42,745 --> 01:40:46,341
They are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.

1923
01:40:54,057 --> 01:40:55,675
This is a shortcut.        Are you kidding me?

1924
01:40:55,678 --> 01:40:56,986
You cannot go down there.

1925
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:05,990
What are you doing?

1926
01:41:12,208 --> 01:41:13,300
Hit him!

1927
01:41:21,017 --> 01:41:22,682
Where are we?        Chelsea Pier.

1928
01:41:28,858 --> 01:41:29,950
What the hell?

1929
01:41:31,294 --> 01:41:32,688
Jesus!

1930
01:41:39,736 --> 01:41:41,787
Them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.

1931
01:41:42,338 --> 01:41:43,396
Go!

1932
01:41:48,544 --> 01:41:49,636
Come on!

1933
01:41:51,514 --> 01:41:53,672
We're cops! Hit the chopper!

1934
01:42:16,005 --> 01:42:17,711
This is Martin and Fosse, en route. 

1935
01:42:17,712 --> 01:42:19,398
Back off! This is our collar!

1936
01:42:20,710 --> 01:42:23,562
Set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!

1937
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:25,238
Take the light!

1938
01:42:44,934 --> 01:42:46,528
Do not authorize that transfer.

1939
01:42:46,569 --> 01:42:48,427
This is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.

1940
01:42:48,428 --> 01:42:50,707
He will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.

1941
01:42:50,740 --> 01:42:53,658
Tell him!        Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.

1942
01:42:53,663 --> 01:42:54,510
Approve it.

1943
01:42:55,978 --> 01:42:57,070
Now.

1944
01:42:57,146 --> 01:42:59,147
Do not touch anything!

1945
01:42:59,148 --> 01:43:01,412
I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.

1946
01:43:01,484 --> 01:43:03,985
Not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.

1947
01:43:03,986 --> 01:43:05,078
Yeah?

1948
01:43:06,456 --> 01:43:09,948
Thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

1949
01:43:10,059 --> 01:43:13,460
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.

1950
01:43:14,163 --> 01:43:16,693
They're at 30 million, and holding.

1951
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:19,068
Wait! Can't you let me...        Take him away.

1952
01:43:19,635 --> 01:43:21,159
But computers.

1953
01:43:22,339 --> 01:43:26,740
What if, one day, they were in charge?

1954
01:43:28,311 --> 01:43:32,707
Now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.

1955
01:43:32,708 --> 01:43:34,875
That's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.

1956
01:43:34,876 --> 01:43:35,912
Now!

1957
01:43:42,959 --> 01:43:44,119
You just stood there!

1958
01:43:44,227 --> 01:43:47,091
I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?

1959
01:43:47,096 --> 01:43:48,961
I knew what that meant.        Shut up.

1960
01:43:49,065 --> 01:43:52,091
You kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.

1961
01:43:52,168 --> 01:43:54,261
Who's got the golden goose now, huh?        Yeah.

1962
01:43:58,307 --> 01:43:59,899
Shit!

1963
01:44:00,576 --> 01:44:03,127
He's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.

1964
01:44:03,128 --> 01:44:04,677
He immediately called your bluff.

1965
01:44:04,781 --> 01:44:06,662
Get up. And kill the police.

1966
01:44:06,682 --> 01:44:08,409
I just wanna make sure I get it right.

1967
01:44:08,410 --> 01:44:11,702
Did you want this transfer approved or not approved?

1968
01:44:12,121 --> 01:44:14,487
You, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.

1969
01:44:16,025 --> 01:44:18,823
Police, don't move! Drop your weapons!

1970
01:44:18,928 --> 01:44:21,863
Drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!

1971
01:44:21,931 --> 01:44:25,226
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.

1972
01:44:25,267 --> 01:44:27,731
Police! Down on the ground!        Let me see your hands!

1973
01:44:35,545 --> 01:44:37,911
Hey, hey, you okay?        Hey.

1974
01:44:38,815 --> 01:44:41,431
Hey, Gene. Captain. I'm sorry.

1975
01:44:41,484 --> 01:44:43,229
I'm sorry.        That's okay. Don't worry about it.

1976
01:44:43,252 --> 01:44:44,851
You can call me Gene when we're not in the office.

1977
01:44:45,221 --> 01:44:47,625
Okay. Thanks for coming by.

1978
01:44:47,673 --> 01:44:49,516
Attaboy.

1979
01:44:49,592 --> 01:44:51,992
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.

1980
01:44:51,992 --> 01:44:54,838
We're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!

1981
01:44:55,231 --> 01:44:57,703
No. No, no, no, no. I'm just resting. 

1982
01:44:57,704 --> 01:44:59,221
I'm just resting.

1983
01:44:59,256 --> 01:45:00,896
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?        I'm just resting.

1984
01:45:00,903 --> 01:45:02,427
Are you all right?        Just resting.

1985
01:45:02,538 --> 01:45:04,341
Hey, let me tell you something.

1986
01:45:04,341 --> 01:45:07,265
As far as paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.

1987
01:45:07,266 --> 01:45:08,768
You know why?        Why?

1988
01:45:08,878 --> 01:45:10,368
Ain't too proud to beg.

1989
01:45:11,013 --> 01:45:12,207
Come on.

1990
01:45:12,281 --> 01:45:14,453
What?        It's not funny anymore.

1991
01:45:14,453 --> 01:45:16,842
I don't know what you're talking about.        TLC references.

1992
01:45:16,853 --> 01:45:19,186
Still nothing. I swear to you.

1993
01:45:19,188 --> 01:45:21,045
I'm gonna go over and check on Terry. 

1994
01:45:21,800 --> 01:45:24,304
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.

1995
01:45:24,594 --> 01:45:27,392
It was the king of the mutt cases,

1996
01:45:27,463 --> 01:45:30,890
but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.

1997
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:36,697
Within 24 hours of learning about Ershon's scheme

1998
01:45:36,706 --> 01:45:38,828
and Lendl's massive losses,

1999
01:45:38,829 --> 01:45:41,988
the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.

2000
01:45:41,988 --> 01:45:44,619
Lendl is in everything, 

2001
01:45:44,620 --> 01:45:46,397
and we're gonna go everywhere...

2002
01:45:46,398 --> 01:45:47,850
They were too big to fail.

2003
01:45:48,150 --> 01:45:53,660
Ershon now resides in Palomino Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.

2004
01:45:53,660 --> 01:45:56,482
He still invests. Currency's just different.

2005
01:45:57,560 --> 01:45:59,960
Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman murder

2006
01:46:00,062 --> 01:46:03,862
by security cam footage which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.

2007
01:46:03,933 --> 01:46:05,764
It only showed the back of their heads.

2008
01:46:05,868 --> 01:46:07,621
But Allen's Faceback app 

2009
01:46:07,622 --> 01:46:10,107
was able to get a match to their faces.

2010
01:46:10,439 --> 01:46:12,524
Terry married Francine.

2011
01:46:12,524 --> 01:46:15,377
He played harp at the reception and it was beautiful.

2012
01:46:15,444 --> 01:46:16,968
He had learned how to play it in the eighth grade

2013
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:20,446
to make fun of the fairy that lived up the street.

2014
01:46:20,550 --> 01:46:24,396
Terry asked Sheila to be his best man, but she declined.

2015
01:46:24,396 --> 01:46:28,552
Let's be honest, we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.

2016
01:46:28,624 --> 01:46:29,852
But guess what?

2017
01:46:29,926 --> 01:46:33,651
The people that do the real work, the ones that make the difference,

2018
01:46:33,651 --> 01:46:36,688
you don't see them on TV or on the front page.

2019
01:46:37,333 --> 01:46:40,791
I'm talking about the day-in, day-outers, the grinders.

2020
01:46:40,937 --> 01:46:44,428
Come on, man, you know who I'm talking about: The other guys.

2021
01:46:44,428 --> 01:46:45,300
See? That's a no-go.        Hey, hey.

2022
01:46:46,075 --> 01:46:48,066
You think you broke this Ershon case open?

2023
01:46:48,477 --> 01:46:49,705
You did nothing.

2024
01:46:50,112 --> 01:46:51,902
Corporate lobbyists are spending millions

2025
01:46:51,902 --> 01:46:54,537
to make sure guys like Ershon keep doing what they do.

2026
01:46:54,917 --> 01:46:55,906
Derek Jeter?

2027
01:46:57,320 --> 01:47:01,003
Yeah, it's me. You were set up that night you shot me, Terry.

2028
01:47:01,003 --> 01:47:03,521
I told you!        They knew by putting someone like you

2029
01:47:03,593 --> 01:47:05,348
with a quick trigger finger next to that door 

2030
01:47:05,349 --> 01:47:06,563
where I do my pre-game walk,

2031
01:47:06,729 --> 01:47:09,568
it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.

2032
01:47:09,632 --> 01:47:11,875
Now, I've been doing my own investigation on the banking industry,

2033
01:47:11,917 --> 01:47:13,926
and I was close. I was real close.

2034
01:47:14,337 --> 01:47:15,497
So I forgive you, Terry.

2035
01:47:16,072 --> 01:47:18,265
I appreciate that, man. I'm sorry about what happened.

2036
01:47:18,941 --> 01:47:20,403
I'm glad you're doing better.

2037
01:47:20,409 --> 01:47:22,847
The whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.

2038
01:47:23,312 --> 01:47:26,633
And the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?

2039
01:47:26,716 --> 01:47:29,463
The same corporations that own the government.

2040
01:47:29,752 --> 01:47:31,447
Courts and the law is all we have left.

2041
01:47:32,788 --> 01:47:34,331
So here's you guys' next case.

2042
01:47:35,358 --> 01:47:38,678
Guy by the name of Carl Bachand, CEO of Killister Bank.

2043
01:47:38,894 --> 01:47:41,181
He took three billion in TARP funds. 

2044
01:47:41,182 --> 01:47:43,252
He's crooked. He's real crooked.

2045
01:47:43,265 --> 01:47:48,261
Take him down, but be careful. He's got Blackwater mercenaries 24l7.

2046
01:47:48,904 --> 01:47:50,064
Thanks, Derek.

2047
01:47:51,374 --> 01:47:53,601
Hey, Derek! Wait! What if we need to get in touch with you,

2048
01:47:53,602 --> 01:47:55,942
get some more information or some tickets or something?

2049
01:47:56,679 --> 01:47:57,839
What just happened?

2050
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,600
POWEREDY BY 100% VEGETABLE OIL

2051
01:48:00,683 --> 01:48:03,777
Goldman Sachs. This case is gonna be nasty.

2052
01:48:06,455 --> 01:48:08,150
Hi. Cute glasses.

2053
01:48:09,158 --> 01:48:11,126
What was that?        What?

2054
01:48:11,193 --> 01:48:14,822
What? Dude, what is it with you and hot ladies? What's your secret?

2055
01:48:14,897 --> 01:48:17,559
Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.

2056
01:48:17,667 --> 01:48:19,692
Tell me who you lost your virginity to.

2057
01:48:19,802 --> 01:48:23,156
She actually became a TV actress. Heather Locklear.

2058
01:48:23,156 --> 01:48:24,921
Heather Locklear, what?

2059
01:48:24,921 --> 01:48:26,301
You've heard of her?        Come on!

2060
01:48:26,375 --> 01:48:28,117
She was much chubbier back then.

2061
01:48:28,400 --> 01:48:31,000
 I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.

2062
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:51,500
-==http://www.ragbear.com==-

2063
01:53:31,080 --> 01:53:32,741
That was you. You don't have a sense of humor.

2064
01:53:32,848 --> 01:53:35,029
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.

2065
01:53:35,029 --> 01:53:36,393
If you say something funny, I'll laugh.

2066
01:53:36,393 --> 01:53:38,041
All right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke.

2067
01:53:38,042 --> 01:53:39,482
Please. I love jokes.

2068
01:53:39,517 --> 01:53:42,098
All right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.

2069
01:53:43,258 --> 01:53:46,511
It's time to get laid.        Already feels inappropriate.

2070
01:53:46,695 --> 01:53:48,919
So he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, " Miss,

2071
01:53:48,919 --> 01:53:50,748
"look, I know usually you want money,

2072
01:53:50,749 --> 01:53:52,515
"but I don't have any money and it's my birthday.

2073
01:53:52,516 --> 01:53:54,412
"Do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?"

2074
01:53:54,636 --> 01:53:56,974
Was he a farmer?        No.

2075
01:53:57,039 --> 01:53:59,560
That's probably a Health Code violation, 

2076
01:53:59,561 --> 01:54:01,583
bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.

2077
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:03,425
They weren't gonna have sex with the duck!

2078
01:54:03,612 --> 01:54:05,795
No, I just mean Health Code violation

2079
01:54:05,795 --> 01:54:09,168
to have the duck brought into a facility like that.

2080
01:54:10,552 --> 01:54:12,863
So, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it. "

2081
01:54:13,255 --> 01:54:15,889
So he goes in there, gives it to her.

2082
01:54:16,258 --> 01:54:17,554
He gives her what?

2083
01:54:17,555 --> 01:54:19,672
The high, hard one! She loves it.

2084
01:54:19,695 --> 01:54:20,928
She goes, " You know what? 

2085
01:54:20,929 --> 01:54:23,188
"If you do that again, I'll give you your duck back. "

2086
01:54:23,188 --> 01:54:25,656
It's like getting laid twice for free.        So... I'm sorry.

2087
01:54:25,657 --> 01:54:26,495
I'm so sorry.

2088
01:54:26,708 --> 01:54:30,404
The duck is payment for sexual intercourse.        Yes. Yes.

2089
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:31,732
Very good.        He used the duck as payment,

2090
01:54:31,807 --> 01:54:33,679
and now he's being paid back the duck.

2091
01:54:33,842 --> 01:54:36,298
He goes, " Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever. " 

2092
01:54:36,299 --> 01:54:37,135
He does it again.

2093
01:54:37,246 --> 01:54:38,901
Now he's walking home, right? Walking...

2094
01:54:38,902 --> 01:54:41,144
So she was satisfied with duck.

2095
01:54:41,145 --> 01:54:43,307
With a duck as currency...        Yes.

2096
01:54:43,308 --> 01:54:45,853
...to her. Great. Good.

2097
01:54:45,988 --> 01:54:47,208
So he's walking home, 

2098
01:54:47,209 --> 01:54:50,024
now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?

2099
01:54:50,202 --> 01:54:52,403
He's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom,

2100
01:54:52,427 --> 01:54:54,082
truck comes by and runs over his duck.

2101
01:54:54,082 --> 01:54:55,578
Kills the duck?        Killed the duck.

2102
01:54:55,578 --> 01:54:57,685
So the duck is now dead.        The duck is dead.

2103
01:54:57,933 --> 01:55:00,241
The kid starts crying, truck driver stops, 

2104
01:55:00,143 --> 01:55:02,050
he's all upset, he didn't mean...        Of course he's crying!

2105
01:55:02,051 --> 01:55:04,682
He's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice,

2106
01:55:04,706 --> 01:55:06,888
and he watched his beloved duck die.

2107
01:55:06,889 --> 01:55:08,315
Will you shut up and let me tell the story?

2108
01:55:08,343 --> 01:55:10,443
So far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.

2109
01:55:10,546 --> 01:55:12,596
The guy feels so bad about killing the duck,

2110
01:55:12,597 --> 01:55:13,583
 he gives him two dollars.

2111
01:55:13,618 --> 01:55:15,063
And the kid's happy with the two bucks?

2112
01:55:15,217 --> 01:55:17,180
He's ecstatic! He got laid twice, 

2113
01:55:17,181 --> 01:55:18,984
and now he's got two dollars on top of it.

2114
01:55:19,019 --> 01:55:21,641
Seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.

2115
01:55:22,391 --> 01:55:23,915
This was a while back. You what I'm...

2116
01:55:24,326 --> 01:55:26,817
So he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?

2117
01:55:26,895 --> 01:55:27,968
"Tell me! Tell me!" 

2118
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:30,828
He goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck,

2119
01:55:30,863 --> 01:55:32,023
"I got a duck for the fuck,

2120
01:55:32,101 --> 01:55:34,644
"and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!"

2121
01:55:36,939 --> 01:55:38,167
So it's like a limerick.

2122
01:55:39,374 --> 01:55:40,602
You didn't think that was funny?

2123
01:55:41,076 --> 01:55:43,191
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure,

2124
01:55:43,645 --> 01:55:45,480
the way all the words were put together,

2125
01:55:45,481 --> 01:55:47,189
but in terms of content?

2126
01:55:48,684 --> 01:55:49,776
No.

2127
01:55:52,988 --> 01:55:56,617
Get the check-check from Shen-Shen. Let's get out of here.

2128
01:56:01,830 --> 01:56:06,398
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

2129
01:56:06,502 --> 01:56:07,526
And cut.
