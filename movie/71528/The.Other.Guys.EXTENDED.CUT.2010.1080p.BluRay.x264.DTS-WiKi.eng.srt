1
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:51,749
In New York City, there's a fine line between law and chaos.

2
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:54,615
On that line live Danson and Highsmith.

3
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:00,348
Tell me again why I decided to get on this roof!

4
00:01:01,294 --> 00:01:04,730
I think you can chalk that up to bad life choices.

5
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,040
Get rid of that asshole.

6
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,083
Uh-oh!        I hate it when you say "uh-oh!"

7
00:01:34,627 --> 00:01:36,761
Dude, you put a ding in my hood!

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,658
Come on with it, then!

9
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,280
That's trouble.

10
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,573
Did someone call Nine-One-holy-shit?

11
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,678
That's it. I'm sick of all this running.

12
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,680
Hang on!

13
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:53,072
You have the right to remain silent!

14
00:02:53,606 --> 00:02:56,200
But I wanna hear you scream!

15
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:12,783
Down on the ground!

16
00:03:13,092 --> 00:03:15,287
Detective! Yeah, yeah! Detective!

17
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,021
One at a time, all right?

18
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,956
Yeah, Detectives, Rick Grayson,

19
00:03:19,957 --> 00:03:22,278
 New York Observer Online.

20
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,436
These suspects were caught with only a quarter pound of marijuana,

21
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,937
a misdemeanor in some states.

22
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,475
Do you think this arrest was worth $12 million in property damages?

23
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:33,707
Why don't we let New York City answer that question?

24
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:36,271
The greatest city on Earth, yeah!

25
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:42,819
Hi, Sarah Gapone from TMZ print edition.

26
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:46,483
Danson, are the rumors about you and Kim Kardashian true?

27
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,151
No comment.

28
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:49,993
But, yes.

29
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:55,056
Danson and Highsmith, free hot dogs for life!

30
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,668
No drinks. No drinks. I can't do it. I can't do it.

31
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:07,210
Danson and Highsmith shoot, drive, and sex with style.

32
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:08,471
 They're rock stars.

33
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,573
Then you got your jokers, your ball busters, your vets...

34
00:04:12,685 --> 00:04:14,585
...and the other guys.

35
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:20,516
We know, we know. We know.

36
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:22,788
All right, all right, all right. Listen up, listen up!

37
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:26,423
We're having a celebration tonight at Butter.

38
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,093
Brody Jenner's gonna be there. Bai Ling.

39
00:04:29,168 --> 00:04:31,966
That little short bitch from Jersey Shore.        Yeah!

40
00:04:32,038 --> 00:04:35,532
And most of you are on the list.

41
00:04:35,533 --> 00:04:37,142
You're the best.

42
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,178
Guys, I'm gonna say something right now.

43
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,645
It's about a man who came from Austria with a dream.

44
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,547
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        Let me finish.

45
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:47,017
He became a champion and then a movie star, all right?

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,281
Arnold Schwarzenegger!        God damn it, let me...

47
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,289
They ruined the story. They ruined the story.

48
00:04:51,357 --> 00:04:52,984
Let...What...The point is,

49
00:04:53,059 --> 00:04:54,701
we couldn't do our job

50
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,154
if it weren't for you guys doing all the paperwork,

51
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:58,527
answering the phones, and all that stupid shit that we don't like to do.

52
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,622
all the gun fights all the car chases

53
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:04,568
all the sex we don't wanna have with women, but we have to,

54
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:08,334
all due to what you guys do. Thank you.

55
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:09,670
And we'd do it again and again.

56
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:12,040
Hey, you shut your face!

57
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,339
If we wanna hear you talk,

58
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:16,314
I will shove my arm up your ass and work your mouth like a puppet!

59
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:18,074
You hear me? You hear me?

60
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,551
Cash bar.        Yeah.

61
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,484
Peace out, bitches.

62
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,825
Hey, fellas. All right, bring it in.

63
00:05:26,893 --> 00:05:28,383
Come on. Bring it in a little bit.

64
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,652
All right, right there.

65
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,698
Just back up, just like right there.

66
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,392
All right, just one...Just a...

67
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,230
There you go, right there. Right there.

68
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,896
This is their paperwork. You know they're not gonna do it.

69
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,203
That's right. This paperwork is like Bob's wife here.

70
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:46,939
It's thick, ugly, got Danson's fingerprints all over it.

71
00:05:47,046 --> 00:05:48,445
No offense, Bob.        That's all right.

72
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,675
Anyway, now who wants it?        I do!

73
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,712
All right! Paper Bitch and Yankee Clipper on the case!

74
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:56,006
Nice work. Thanks, Allen.        Thank you, Captain.

75
00:05:56,008 --> 00:05:56,950
"I'll do it! I'll do it!"

76
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:09,126
Stop humming that song!

77
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:12,961
I can hum if I want to.        No, I know you can.

78
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,300
I'm asking you to stop.

79
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:16,632
Well, if you're asking, then I'll stop.        Thank you.

80
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:23,740
Could you not smile like that?

81
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,432
Now you're asking me to mask my emotions 

82
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,751
because of how it makes you feel.

83
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,551
That I will not do.

84
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,226
Seriously, stop humming! Okay?

85
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,320
This isn't accounting or wherever the hell

86
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,764
you and your little pocket calculator were transferred from.

87
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:45,103
Forensic accounting, okay. And it's an important part of the job.

88
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:45,844
Yeah, whatever. 

89
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:48,966
Stop being so overtly happy about doing shit work, you moron.

90
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,940
Hey, guys. Reminder.

91
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,241
The police union picnic's coming up this weekend.

92
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:58,943
My wife's making her famous deviled eggs, again. My waistline's furious.

93
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:00,417
It's a bad time, Bob!

94
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,515
All right.

95
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,182
Going to get a slice.

96
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,633
You know what I just did?

97
00:07:18,704 --> 00:07:21,002
I just walked out that door, saw a couple detectives,

98
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,598
and I was about to start bad mouthing you behind your back,

99
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,871
but I stopped myself, because my pops taught me

100
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,606
that a man who talks behind somebody's back is a coward.

101
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:29,875
Wow, I actually appreciate that.

102
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:31,779
Good, 'cause I'm gonna tell you directly to your face.

103
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,615
No. You don't have to.        No, I don't like you.

104
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,120
I think you're a fake cop.

105
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:39,955
The sound of your piss hitting the urinal? It sounds feminine.

106
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:42,790
If we were in the wild, I would attack you.

107
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,670
Even if you weren't in my food chain, 

108
00:07:44,671 --> 00:07:47,562
I would go out of my way to attack you.

109
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:49,225
If I were a lion, and you were a tuna,

110
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,929
I would swim out in the middle of the ocean and freaking eat you!

111
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,397
And then I'd bang your tuna girlfriend.

112
00:07:55,508 --> 00:08:00,242
Okay, first off, a lion swimming in the ocean?

113
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,256
Lions don't like water.

114
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:04,714
If you'd placed it near a river or some sort of fresh water source,

115
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,550
 that'd make sense.

116
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:07,883
But you find yourself in the ocean, 20-foot waves,

117
00:08:07,954 --> 00:08:09,717
I'm assuming it's off the coast of South Africa,

118
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,329
coming up against a full-grown, 800-pound tuna 

119
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,357
with his 20 or 30 friends?

120
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:16,588
You lose that battle.

121
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,597
You lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what?

122
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,058
You've wandered into our school of tuna,

123
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,966
 and we now have a taste of lion.

124
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,470
We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated.

125
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,732
Yeah?        And said, " You know what?

126
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,970
"Lion tastes good. Let's go get some more lion. "

127
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:33,637
We've developed a system to establish a beachhead

128
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:36,647
and aggressively hunt you and your family.

129
00:08:36,749 --> 00:08:38,910
And we will corner your pride,

130
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,885
your children, your offspring.        How you gonna do that?

131
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,748
We will construct a series of breathing apparatus with kelp.

132
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,115
We will be able to trap certain amounts of oxygen.

133
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,866
It's not gonna be days at a time, 

134
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:52,004
but an hour, hour 45, no problem.

135
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,426
That will give us enough time to figure out where you live,

136
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,894
go back to the sea, get more oxygen, and then stalk you.

137
00:08:57,895 --> 00:09:01,562
You just lost at your own game. You're outgunned and outmanned.

138
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:07,238
Did that go the way you thought it was gonna go?

139
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:08,439
Nope.

140
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:17,614
Two minutes before the markets open,

141
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,991
Pamela Boardman, CEO of Lendl Global, 

142
00:09:19,992 --> 00:09:21,140
ringing the opening bell.

143
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,628
With Boardman is investment banker, David Ershon,

144
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:27,254
who manages 40% of Lendl's $70-billion equity pool.

145
00:09:27,266 --> 00:09:30,099
How much did we lose?

146
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:32,967
You may ring the bell now, Ms. Boardman.

147
00:09:32,968 --> 00:09:34,931
$32.        Million?

148
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,537
No, billion.

149
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:40,478
Shit!

150
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:45,650
Chinatown. Three Triad gang members. I popped two of them off the draw.

151
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:47,513
Bang, bang.        Yeah.

152
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,512
Then I raise up to take the leader out.

153
00:09:49,513 --> 00:09:50,812
Shit, I feel like I'm there now.

154
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:53,585
I hear a whistle. My partner's on the roof.

155
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:55,490
He says, "Let's even the odds!"

156
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:59,993
He tosses me down a Mossberg pump. I send one through his chest.

157
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,557
Game over, bitches.

158
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,332
All right.        Yeah.

159
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:12,436
Jimmy? Let's talk about how that story made you feel.

160
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,001
Like my cock was made out of concrete.

161
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:17,248
I know it's very tempting.

162
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,511
You want to impress your friends.

163
00:10:19,585 --> 00:10:22,076
But this is serious stuff we're dealing with, okay?

164
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:25,859
This is firing your weapon in the line of duty.

165
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,949
Officer Hoitz?

166
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,724
Oh, man.

167
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:29,954
Come on!        Here we go.

168
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:31,428
Would you like to share?

169
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:32,656
No, I'd rather not.

170
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,399
Officer Hoitz, you've been coming here for six months now,

171
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:37,264
and you haven't said a word.

172
00:10:37,336 --> 00:10:39,702
This is a safe room, no judgment here.

173
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,864
Jerkoff.

174
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,238
That's judgment, Jimmy. Come on.

175
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:44,835
I relive it every night.

176
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:48,112
Bronx, October.

177
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:50,011
Game 7 of the World Series.

178
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:52,124
For all the marbles. High pressure, unruly crowd, 

179
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,348
and I pulled tunnel duty.

180
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,552
I mean, I saw a shadowy figure in the tunnel. I told him to stop.

181
00:10:56,553 --> 00:10:58,255
Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a restricted area!

182
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,688
Finally pulled my gun.

183
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,056
Pulled a deadly weapon. He started running at me.

184
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:03,027
Don't make me shoot! I'll do it!

185
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,328
Are you deaf? You hear me yell, "Freeze"?

186
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:09,360
You dick! I'm Derek Jeter! You shot me!

187
00:11:09,435 --> 00:11:12,199
You cost me 20 grand on that game!        Douche bag.

188
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,738
Cost the city a championship.

189
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,138
I was being groomed for a top position in homicide.

190
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,070
Now I'm stuck with a desk jockey partner. 

191
00:11:18,071 --> 00:11:19,406
Everybody calls me the Yankee Clipper.

192
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,872
Because you shot Derek Jeter!

193
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,243
He's a biracial angel.

194
00:11:22,314 --> 00:11:23,975
You should've shot A-Rod.

195
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,955
Yo, Paper Bitch.

196
00:11:33,325 --> 00:11:34,986
What's up, man?        Hey. Hey, guys.

197
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,789
Paper Bitch.        Paper Bitch.

198
00:11:36,896 --> 00:11:37,954
I don't like that, actually.

199
00:11:38,064 --> 00:11:39,827
I know you guys think it's fun, but I don't like that name.

200
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,490
Still working on the Danson and Highsmith paperwork?

201
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,659
Shit.        No, actually, actually, that's...

202
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,134
What is this? That looks stupid.

203
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:47,629
Guys, it's illegal permitting for construction. 

204
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:48,933
Specifically, scaffolding.

205
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:50,465
Some of the guys were talking.

206
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,071
They were like, " How come you've never 

207
00:11:52,072 --> 00:11:53,794
fired your weapon in the office before?"

208
00:11:53,829 --> 00:11:54,794
Good point.

209
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,211
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

210
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:57,748
You've never fired your weapon in the office.

211
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,977
We all have, you know. It's called a desk pop.

212
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:02,748
Fellas, look, I know you don't respect me as a police officer.

213
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,981
Not true.        I'm not stupid.

214
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:06,524
I'm not gonna discharge my firearm in the office.

215
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,184
Gamble, listen to me. I'll try to make it real clear.

216
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,803
We honor the flag, 

217
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:12,425
and you crap on it when you don't shoot your gun in the office.

218
00:12:12,531 --> 00:12:14,890
Jimmy. When's the last time you had a desk pop?

219
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:16,627
September '08.

220
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,765
Be a man. Do it.        Now.

221
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,532
Please, please, do it.        Pop one off!

222
00:12:20,606 --> 00:12:22,699
There you go. Pop it off!        Don't think, just go!

223
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:24,333
Here we go.        Do it, yes.

224
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,003
He did it!

225
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:28,944
Hey! Shots fired!

226
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:32,176
Hey, Terry, I did it! I did my first desk pop!

227
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,243
It's a real thing, right?

228
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,843
A desk pop?        Yeah.

229
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,047
No, that's not real!

230
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:41,082
They were so convincing in their argument, they swung me.

231
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,927
All right, Allen, you're gonna have to hand over your gun.

232
00:12:46,031 --> 00:12:47,123
Yes, sir.

233
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:49,136
Captain, you really wanna disarm this guy,

234
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:51,227
 take out the batteries in the calculator.

235
00:12:51,303 --> 00:12:54,108
All right, I'm gonna give you this. This is a dummy gun.

236
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:55,380
 I use it for ceremony.

237
00:12:55,404 --> 00:12:56,234
There.

238
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,871
You get this back when I feel you know how to handle it.

239
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,143
Listen, guys. I'm working two jobs. I'm working here.

240
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,414
And I got another job at Bed Bath and Beyond. Okay?

241
00:13:08,487 --> 00:13:11,115
I'm doing that just to put a kid through NYU

242
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,956
so he can explore his bisexuality and become a deejay.

243
00:13:15,027 --> 00:13:18,485
Now the last thing I need is a ballistics report in the unit.

244
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:20,963
I'm just gonna ask you guys, please, come on, really.

245
00:13:21,033 --> 00:13:22,796
Just think about...Just be smart.

246
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,798
211 in progress.

247
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:56,960
They're using a wrecking ball to clean out Castien Jewelry.

248
00:13:57,036 --> 00:13:58,469
All right, we got it.

249
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,869
Good luck, guys. Have a good one.        Allen, let's go.

250
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:03,840
No, I got work to do.        What? This is work!

251
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:07,504
Hey, yo! Danson and Highsmith. We roll in heavy.

252
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,911
You cream puffs, sit tight.

253
00:14:09,014 --> 00:14:10,345
You gotta be shitting me!

254
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,512
You can't keep me cooped up in here, okay?

255
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:16,680
I am a peacock! You gotta let me fly!

256
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:25,057
Did he just...Did he just call himself a peacock?

257
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:29,829
Let's go! Let's go!

258
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:33,930
Come on, fellas!

259
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:36,573
Wednesday night is taco night at Rikers Island!

260
00:14:51,222 --> 00:14:52,749
That's the second one this week!

261
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:55,417
Hey, you monkeys! Stop!

262
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,221
Let's go!

263
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,121
Yeah!

264
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:00,892
Heads up!

265
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,307
Shit.

266
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:17,840
Special Forces zipline.

267
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,913
Cut that line! Cut it! Let's go!

268
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,417
These guys are pros.        Let's go!

269
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:24,888
You thinking what I'm thinking, partner?

270
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:26,583
Aim for the bushes.

271
00:15:54,186 --> 00:15:57,849
Cops still argue to this day why Danson and Highsmith jumped.

272
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,916
Maybe it was just pride, having survived so many brushes with death.

273
00:16:01,994 --> 00:16:04,155
Maybe their egos pushed them off.

274
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,959
I don't know. But that shit was crazy.

275
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:10,167
Either way, there was a hole in New York City, 

276
00:16:10,168 --> 00:16:11,766
and it needed to be filled.

277
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:14,135
Two days ago, this city wept.

278
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:18,165
We lost two heroes who gave everything for us,

279
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,444
who paid that ultimate sacrifice

280
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:23,881
 so that we may walk these streets safely.

281
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,674
There wasn't even an awning in their direction.

282
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,945
No, I know.        They just jumped 20 stories.

283
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,351
Doesn't make sense, does it?

284
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:33,323
I only hope God lets them take their. 357s with them to heaven.

285
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,663
It's our moment, Allen. 

286
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,726
Our moment to step up and be the guys.

287
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,891
We're at a funeral. Show some respect.        What?

288
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:41,825
You don't think every other detective here

289
00:16:41,826 --> 00:16:43,081
 isn't thinking the same thing?

290
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:48,501
Allen, listen to me. Danson and Highsmith are gone.

291
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,199
Their desks are empty. Someone has to fill those seats.

292
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,837
That someone is us, okay? The city's dying for a hero.

293
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,670
Is it?        Yeah.

294
00:16:56,749 --> 00:17:00,378
What about nine million socially-conscious and unified citizens,

295
00:17:00,486 --> 00:17:02,215
all just stepping up and doing their part?

296
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,551
As a little kid, didn't you dress up and play cops and robbers?

297
00:17:04,656 --> 00:17:06,817
I'll tell you what I did as a little kid.

298
00:17:06,892 --> 00:17:09,224
I went to school and made my bed.

299
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,922
And at age 11, I audited my parents.

300
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,330
And believe me, there were some discrepancies, and I was grounded.

301
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:17,266
What the hell are you?

302
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,338
Well, well, well. What do we got here?

303
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:22,109
Look at these two jamokes, would you? 

304
00:17:22,110 --> 00:17:24,503
One shot Jeter and the other shot an office.

305
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,510
Have some decorum. We're at a funeral.

306
00:17:30,582 --> 00:17:32,777
You wanna dance, brolio?

307
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,693
I will rock your body with big, nasty hooks. 

308
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:37,238
You'll be pissing blood out of your ass.

309
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,853
That's horrible.

310
00:17:38,888 --> 00:17:39,550
Why don't you step back, man?

311
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:41,092
You touch him, I swear to God

312
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:43,094
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you with Allen's head.

313
00:17:43,095 --> 00:17:45,920
He's not gonna do that. That's hyperbole. But that's a weird example.

314
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,728
You wanna go?        I wanna go!

315
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,299
Get him off.        Kick his ass, Martin.

316
00:17:50,936 --> 00:17:52,130
Yeah. How do you like that?

317
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:55,063
Pull his hair!        I love it.

318
00:17:55,274 --> 00:17:56,935
This hurts so good.

319
00:17:57,876 --> 00:18:00,437
Very sorry for your loss, ma'am.        What a lovely hat.

320
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:01,670
I love your shoes.

321
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,771
It's fine, it's fine.        Go, go.

322
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:05,542
Punish him!

323
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:07,642
Oh, man.

324
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,288
Do it. That's how we do it in the hood.

325
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:11,583
Punish him.        That's not even a move.

326
00:18:12,825 --> 00:18:15,123
I'm the winner. I'm the winner, everybody saw it.

327
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:17,195
What the hell is going on here?

328
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,321
Two good men are dead,

329
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:22,792
you guys are fighting over who's gonna be the next hotshot?

330
00:18:22,793 --> 00:18:23,794
Is that what's happening?

331
00:18:23,802 --> 00:18:25,626
Yes, that's exactly what's happening.

332
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:28,062
Let me tell you something.

333
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,671
Sorry for your loss, Lorraine.        Very sorry.

334
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:32,476
Sorry, Lorraine.        Sorry, Lorraine.

335
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,308
Hi, I'm Jimmy.

336
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,175
Too soon?        Why'd you say that?

337
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:39,341
I'll tell you something about those guys.

338
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:42,086
They knew that to become a good cop, 

339
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,415
you had to solve cases. Okay?

340
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:48,088
Okay, and maybe you start with the Castien robbery.

341
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,757
Okay? So just watch it.

342
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,931
Next time, me, you, library.

343
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,159
Not even close.        Come on, guys. Guys, come on.

344
00:18:56,902 --> 00:18:58,836
You are...        I'm the winner!

345
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,080
I didn't need you to stick up for me, okay? 

346
00:19:01,081 --> 00:19:02,504
I could've handled that myself.

347
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,938
Hey, don't flatter yourself. It's the partner's code. I had no choice.

348
00:19:06,044 --> 00:19:07,272
Move.

349
00:19:16,288 --> 00:19:19,851
9:15, let's have a great day, everybody!        Cut the shit!

350
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:27,659
Good morning.

351
00:19:28,534 --> 00:19:31,833
We've got shots fired. 509 East 10th Street.

352
00:19:31,904 --> 00:19:34,038
There are large amounts of cocaine on the scene.

353
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,532
Try to stay out of trouble, boys.

354
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,801
There's no chance you'd wanna go on that call, right?

355
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,706
No chance. Too busy.

356
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:41,633
All right, ladies. Starting to get the picture?

357
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,529
 We're about to lock shit down.

358
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,606
That's right.        You girls stay here and get your type on.

359
00:19:45,617 --> 00:19:47,517
Go get them, guys. Lot of energy, lot of focus.

360
00:19:47,518 --> 00:19:48,645
Shut up!

361
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,514
Allen, could I see you in the hallway for a second?

362
00:19:51,556 --> 00:19:53,023
I...I'm super busy right now, Terry.

363
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,491
No, no, no, I know. This'll be real quick.

364
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,425
It's about the construction permits you were talking about.

365
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,519
The scaffolding violations?        This is our thing, yeah.

366
00:20:00,165 --> 00:20:01,723
So, what do you got?

367
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:04,324
I got this! I'll put one right in your neck.

368
00:20:04,403 --> 00:20:05,495
What are you doing?

369
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:08,267
Let's go. We're going to that call.

370
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,231
What is this?        Shut up.

371
00:20:10,242 --> 00:20:12,374
We're going to the car, and we're going after this case.

372
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:14,237
You're not gonna shoot me.        I won't?

373
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,413
No.        I shot Jeter.

374
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,675
That was an accident.        Was it?

375
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:19,273
Now move.        Okay.

376
00:20:20,018 --> 00:20:21,349
Hey.

377
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,617
Does anybody see this? He's got a gun on me.

378
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,520
I'm being kidnapped.

379
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,686
Really, we're in a police station and no one is interested in this?

380
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,665
So, then what happened?        What do you think happened?

381
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,482
I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, 

382
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:36,215
and I got in my car, and I got out of there.

383
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:37,391
Talk about a wild weekend, right?

384
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:40,768
I thought I was gonna have to shoot my way out.

385
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:43,033
What are you gonna do, though, you know? Bar mitzvahs.

386
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:47,275
What the hell is this?

387
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,075
It's my car. It's a Prius.

388
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,811
I feel like we're literally driving around in a vagina.

389
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,752
Detective Hoitz and Gamble are on that 518 on East 10th.

390
00:20:56,822 --> 00:20:58,915
Negatory, Martin and Fosse, two minutes out.

391
00:20:58,991 --> 00:21:00,720
We'll just see who's there first.

392
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:03,488
You stay out of our crime scene! You hear me?

393
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,220
Go, go, go!

394
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,327
You feel that, Allen? That tingling in your balls?

395
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:10,498
Big metal butterflies fluttering around in your stomach?

396
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,294
Are you sure you don't have testicular cancer?

397
00:21:12,295 --> 00:21:14,129
I got something to get you going.

398
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:19,136
Let's go do some damage!

399
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:21,807
Nope.

400
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:25,309
What the hell is that?

401
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,278
LRB. Little River Band.

402
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:30,452
This music makes me feel like I'm going shopping for a training bra.

403
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:33,257
You know what? We go with no music, okay?

404
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:34,451
Fine.        Say bye.

405
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:35,652
No, no, no, don't say bye...

406
00:21:35,761 --> 00:21:37,456
You just signed your own death warrant, Hoitz!

407
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:40,760
Allen, punch that accelerator or I will shoot you in the foot!

408
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,265
America!

409
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,865
Allen! Allen, hit the brake!

410
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:48,935
Seriously, slow the car down! We're approaching the crime scene!

411
00:21:48,936 --> 00:21:49,799
Terry, I'm coming in.

412
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,706
You're gonna smash right through the tape! Allen!

413
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:53,477
Dude! What...

414
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:00,811
That's a lot of cocaine.

415
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,979
Did you yell "America" when you hit the accelerator?

416
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,653
Nope. No. No.

417
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,691
I've never actually put my foot all the way down

418
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,792
to the ground with the accelerator like that.

419
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,164
It got me slightly aroused.

420
00:22:19,705 --> 00:22:21,297
Here we go.

421
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,833
Way to put your stamp on the crime scene, guys.

422
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,346
Prius, huh?        Yep, yep.

423
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:30,676
Good mileage?

424
00:22:30,749 --> 00:22:32,148
Outstanding.        Yeah.

425
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:34,811
Did this come with a dental dam?

426
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,420
No.        Get it?

427
00:22:38,924 --> 00:22:40,892
My Suburban shit one of these last night.

428
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:42,926
I didn't know they put tampons on wheels.

429
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,356
We've had our fun, huh?

430
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,399
Looks like Scarface sneezed on your car.

431
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,259
All right, everybody!

432
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,395
I'm gonna need you all to back up now. We're taking over.

433
00:22:53,505 --> 00:22:55,905
"At the crime scene, LOL."

434
00:22:56,007 --> 00:22:57,702
Good tweet, good tweet.        Yeah, thanks.

435
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:02,242
America has always been defined by its excess.

436
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,516
The Grand Canyon, professional sports contracts.

437
00:23:05,584 --> 00:23:08,018
Wendy's Baconator, extra bacon.

438
00:23:08,086 --> 00:23:12,254
I myself have 18 Lamborghinis

439
00:23:13,125 --> 00:23:15,059
and a Subaru station wagon.

440
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:18,261
And it's because of this excess that I have flourished.

441
00:23:18,363 --> 00:23:21,958
I implore you, please, do not stop profiting.

442
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:25,764
Live for excess. It's the American way.

443
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,607
Hello.

444
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:37,475
Mr. Ershon? I believe this call's for you.

445
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,045
Sir David.

446
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,310
David. You're not returning my calls, 

447
00:23:44,311 --> 00:23:45,750
so I'd like you to meet Roger Wesley.

448
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,451
G'day, mate.        Hey.

449
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:50,157
Roger and his team are gonna babysit you because I don't trust you,

450
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,884
because I think you're going to take off.

451
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,095
Pamela, this is ridiculous. I'm not going anywhere.

452
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,991
David, listen, the Lendl quarterlies come out on the 26th.

453
00:23:57,992 --> 00:23:59,293
You have until then to give me my money. 

454
00:23:59,294 --> 00:24:00,803
I'm not reporting any losses, David.

455
00:24:00,805 --> 00:24:02,816
I have zeroed in on a new investor.

456
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,834
Well, then, you get their money,

457
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:05,904
 make it disappear, and then pay us back.

458
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:09,333
Yes, yes, I'll tell him he doesn't need to keep watching me.

459
00:24:09,334 --> 00:24:11,505
David!        Okay, sweetheart, bye-bye.

460
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:15,985
Yeah. She overreacted. She's a woman. So, you're good to go.

461
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,513
Heard everything, mate.

462
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,881
Ladies and gentlemen,

463
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:23,484
guess who gave me the secrets to making my first billion dollars.

464
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,864
That man there.

465
00:24:27,666 --> 00:24:29,657
Go! Go!

466
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,799
Side!        Step aside, please.

467
00:24:32,571 --> 00:24:34,334
You don't think I'm a real cop, do you?

468
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,670
No, I don't. I've said that directly to your face numerous times.

469
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:37,867
I was really honest about that.

470
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,467
I'm working on a huge case, all right?

471
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:42,672
Property owner with seven buildings under construction.

472
00:24:42,747 --> 00:24:45,875
He hasn't applied for a single scaffolding permit.

473
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,460
Now, according to Ask Jeeves, 

474
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,374
this perp is at the Plaza Hotel speaking right now.

475
00:24:50,409 --> 00:24:53,718
That's your big case? Scaffolding permits?        Yeah.

476
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:57,055
Guess what? You're coming with me.

477
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,729
It's a wooden gun.

478
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,065
That hurts, man!

479
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,679
I've always got Little River Band loaded up here. 

480
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,207
I've got six disks in here.

481
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:14,505
Claude, meet me outside, at the back of the service entrance.

482
00:25:14,506 --> 00:25:16,747
I'm flying Air Singapore.

483
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,543
Hey, Douglas. How's the wife?        She died.

484
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:19,709
Attaboy!

485
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,752
I'll be there in two minutes exactly.

486
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,715
Another thing I hate about you? You always pay in exact change.

487
00:25:25,716 --> 00:25:27,888
You're just mad because I have a nice change purse.

488
00:25:27,959 --> 00:25:29,085
Why do you even care?

489
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,129
How can I help it? You know what? You know what's worse?

490
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,255
The way you fart. Even your farts, they're not manly.

491
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:35,458
You're being ridiculous.

492
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:38,127
They sound like a baby blowing out the candles on a birthday cake.

493
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:39,533
What?        Like a little...

494
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:41,469
You know what bugs me about you?        What?

495
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,104
I'm pretty sure you've never voted.

496
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:46,307
No, I vote. Sports radio, AM 880. Play of the week.

497
00:25:46,411 --> 00:25:48,743
You're like a child in a leather jacket. That's what you're like.

498
00:25:48,813 --> 00:25:49,905
Get out of the way, man!

499
00:25:49,981 --> 00:25:51,881
Wait. Are you David Ershon?

500
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:55,248
Yeah, well, it's Sir David Ershon, but I don't bother with the...

501
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,585
Anyway, little bit of a rush, gentlemen, if you don't mind. Thank you.

502
00:25:58,657 --> 00:26:01,922
Excuse me, but you're under arrest, okay?        What?

503
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:06,930
You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say can be used

504
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:09,125
What's the next part?        As a floatation device.

505
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:10,724
As a floatation device.

506
00:26:10,802 --> 00:26:14,629
You know what? That's very funny. I have never Miranda-ed anyone before.

507
00:26:14,639 --> 00:26:16,236
Really?        Are you guys for real?

508
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:17,400
Am I being punk'd?

509
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:19,840
Detective Allen Gamble.

510
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,700
We are in a cocaine-covered car, 

511
00:26:21,701 --> 00:26:23,127
and we are bringing in a perp.

512
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:26,006
One David Ershon.        175 pounds.

513
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:27,842
Thank you. 175 pounds.        Shut up, man, shut up!

514
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,126
Martin and Fosse are probably on Studio B 

515
00:26:30,127 --> 00:26:31,853
talking to Shepard Smith right now.

516
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,790
We arrest this jerkoff for a scaffolding permit?

517
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:37,161
Wait, wait, wait, what am I being arrested for?

518
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,027
For scaffolding permit violation...

519
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,939
I got my insurance card. Somewhere.        Easy, mate.

520
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,374
What the hell? You ran right into us!        Stand over there.

521
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,002
Wood?

522
00:26:54,546 --> 00:26:55,672
What the...

523
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,543
Couldn't see the car. It's big enough, mate.        What?

524
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,276
Do not let these men take me.

525
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:02,144
Hi.

526
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:04,778
Why's she looking at you like that?

527
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:06,346
That's my car!

528
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:10,189
Hey, hey, hey! We didn't exchange insurance information!

529
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,120
Hey! Excuse me!

530
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,398
Why did they take our shoes?

531
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,901
What the hell just happened?        Where's my iPhone?

532
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:22,198
I think we've walked 30 blocks, man.

533
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:25,429
I don't get why we can't just call the office 

534
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,336
and have a squad car come pick us up.

535
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:30,003
No. They took our shoes, our guns, and our car.

536
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:31,992
There's no way that's going out on the radio.

537
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:33,274
Look, if we're gonna do this together, 

538
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,146
there's some issues we need to settle, okay?

539
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,815
I mean, you said I had a weak chin. You said the way I pee is feminine.

540
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,084
How do you think that makes me feel?

541
00:27:40,191 --> 00:27:43,254
I mean, that list you have, you put a lot of thought in. It's weird.

542
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:47,593
I hear you.

543
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:50,532
Let's clean the slate right now. Fresh start.

544
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,165
All right. Fresh start.

545
00:27:56,875 --> 00:28:00,536
Maybe we should call ourselves the Febreze Brothers,

546
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:02,403
'cause it's feeling so fresh right now.

547
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:04,740
Right?

548
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,245
Let's do another fresh start, 

549
00:28:06,246 --> 00:28:07,918
'cause I just wanted to punch you in the face.

550
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,781
Fine, fresh start.

551
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,686
It's the last one.

552
00:28:12,757 --> 00:28:15,391
I have to be able to express myself and say things, you know.

553
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,793
Okay, folks! Everybody, listen up!        Listen up!

554
00:28:20,795 --> 00:28:22,399
Got a high profile kidnapping.

555
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,933
David Ershon, wealthy banker, multinational team.

556
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,062
Maybe a sleeper cell, but it's too early to tell.

557
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,576
Hey, Bilbo Baggins. Where are your shoes? 'Cause your feet are black.

558
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:34,635
Who cares? It's not important, okay?

559
00:28:34,746 --> 00:28:37,571
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain. Not good.

560
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,878
Bye, guys.        Bye-bye.

561
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,044
Come on.

562
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:45,650
Guys, this is Don Beaman, the attorney for Mr. Ershon.

563
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:48,204
Roger Wesley, head of his private security.

564
00:28:48,205 --> 00:28:49,893
Hey, how are you? You son of a bitch!        Hey, hey, hey!

565
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,724
Hey, Terry! Take it easy!

566
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:53,382
That's the guy who took our guns, Captain.

567
00:28:53,383 --> 00:28:54,828
And my shoes!        Wait a minute, wait a minute. 

568
00:28:54,829 --> 00:28:56,993
Did you identify yourselves as police officers?

569
00:28:57,018 --> 00:28:58,060
What is this?

570
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:00,468
Allen, tell me. Did you?        No, we did not.

571
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,086
Sorry, gentlemen. 

572
00:29:02,566 --> 00:29:04,566
We thought you were abducting Mr. Ershon.

573
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,270
It's only protocol.

574
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:11,208
Mr. Ershon has agreed to correct this scaffolding situation.

575
00:29:11,209 --> 00:29:12,209
 The case is closed.

576
00:29:11,232 --> 00:29:13,673
I've taken care of all necessary paperwork.

577
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:15,878
And you fellas, at this point, should just be glad that

578
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,479
Mr. Ershon is not pressing charges for excessive use of force.

579
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:21,024
Thank you, Captain.        You bet.

580
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,151
Australian?

581
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:24,661
Special Forces, right?

582
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:27,554
Best watch your step, Detective.

583
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:30,361
There are three things I love in this world.

584
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,526
Kylie Minogue,

585
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,902
small dimples just above a woman's buttocks...

586
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,372
Beautiful features.

587
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,205
...and the fear in a man's eye who knows I'm about to hurt him.

588
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:44,839
Hey! Shake your dicks. This pissing contest is over.

589
00:29:44,916 --> 00:29:46,247
Come on, man.

590
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:51,914
All right, look, they returned your shoes.

591
00:29:52,357 --> 00:29:56,589
And they returned your weapons. Here you go, Terry.

592
00:29:58,196 --> 00:30:00,892
Allen, someone was nice enough to put linseed oil on it,

593
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,832
some kind of stain on that, dark walnut or something.

594
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,496
You might wanna think about dropping them a thank you note.

595
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:07,697
Okay.

596
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:08,898
You're mad at us, huh, Gene?

597
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,704
First off, don't call me Gene. I'm your captain.

598
00:30:12,777 --> 00:30:15,721
Guys, do you remember the "Be Smart" speech?

599
00:30:15,722 --> 00:30:16,572
Sure.        All right.

600
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,275
Well, what did you do? What'd you do about it?

601
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:22,182
The opposite. We were not smart, Captain Gene.

602
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:24,221
It's just "Captain. "

603
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:27,349
Just "Captain. " It's not "Captain Gene. " I don't have a kiddie show.

604
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:29,052
That sounds creepy, "Captain Gene. "

605
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:33,521
Police mistakenly arrest investment banker, David Ershon.

606
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:36,533
Was he the victim of financial profiling?

607
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,553
Financial profiling? That's crazy. 

608
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,301
He broke the law and we arrested him.

609
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:45,467
That wasn't a security team. He said, "Don't let these people take me. "

610
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:48,277
I mean, when you hear hooves, you think horses, not zebras.

611
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,077
What about donkeys or deer?

612
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,117
They have hooves. What about bovine creatures?

613
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,246
Were you just thinking to yourself, "Fresh start"?

614
00:30:57,322 --> 00:31:00,291
Yeah.        Yeah. I could see it.

615
00:31:00,391 --> 00:31:02,850
Listen, why don't we just go over to my place?

616
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,221
We'll talk the case down.

617
00:31:04,222 --> 00:31:06,227
We can have a little dinner. You can meet Sheila.

618
00:31:06,227 --> 00:31:09,193
Two cops talking down a case while eating food, all right?

619
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,330
It's not dinner.        Fine.

620
00:31:10,334 --> 00:31:12,232
And let me apologize in advance, okay,

621
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:14,503
in case my wife acts like a world-class bitch.

622
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:20,171
She's a big old broad, and she likes to wield it.

623
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:22,744
Okay, so I put together a little bio, 

624
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:25,682
complete with pictures of Mr. David Ershon.

625
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:29,584
I used Adobe Premiere. I like to do a little weekend editing.

626
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,848
I recently just cut three minutes out of Goodfellas.

627
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:36,188
David Ershon is currently the CEO of Ershon Consortium.

628
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:37,352
Who's that talking?

629
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:39,987
It's the Frontline Narration App. It's only 99 cents.

630
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:44,091
Ershon Consortium, current financial investments exceed $70 billion.

631
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,494
His largest clients include Schering-Plough and Lendl Global.

632
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,001
Lendl Global has those TV ads where I can't figure out what they do.

633
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:52,013
Yeah, oil, media, health care, 

634
00:31:52,014 --> 00:31:53,169
you've probably heard their jingle.

635
00:31:53,278 --> 00:31:56,213
Lendl Global, we're in everything

636
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:59,147
David Ershon is often found in the company of Judge Scalia...

637
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:01,549
Yeah.        ...and the lead singer of Maroon 5.

638
00:32:01,653 --> 00:32:03,484
I mean, this guy could be connected to drug cartels,

639
00:32:03,554 --> 00:32:06,787
black market organ sales, human trafficking, all of it.

640
00:32:06,791 --> 00:32:08,418
How do you get that from anything I just said?

641
00:32:08,419 --> 00:32:09,989
Hey, guys! Soup's on.

642
00:32:10,061 --> 00:32:11,460
What do you mean?

643
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:14,656
Hi.

644
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,324
Hi.        You must be Terry.

645
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,632
I'm sorry I've been hiding, honey, but this dinner was tricky.

646
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:23,935
Who are you?        I'm Dr. Sheila Gamble, his wife.

647
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,670
Come on, seriously. Who is that?        His old lady.

648
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,235
Sweetie, it's a workstation.        Got it.

649
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:33,074
And you come in here, dressed like a hobo, it's distracting.

650
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,918
I know you're working. I'm so sorry.

651
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:37,210
Come on, seriously.        Come on, what?

652
00:32:37,211 --> 00:32:38,316
Who is that?

653
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:40,414
That's the old...That's the old ball and chain.

654
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,318
Get over here.

655
00:32:44,395 --> 00:32:46,022
Not...Not right now.        Okay.

656
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,088
Look, they're not all first-round picks, okay?

657
00:32:48,499 --> 00:32:49,898
Come on, are you gonna tell me who that is?

658
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:54,260
Are you really Allen's wife?        I know.

659
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:55,468
People are shocked 

660
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,831
because he's Episcopalian and I'm Catholic,

661
00:32:58,509 --> 00:32:59,942
but somehow it works.

662
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,238
Are you gonna change?        I already did.

663
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:05,575
It's no big deal. You look really, really nice.

664
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:10,044
Terry, you don't have to be polite, okay? She looks kind of shitty.

665
00:33:10,045 --> 00:33:11,485
Don't speak to her like that, Allen.

666
00:33:11,486 --> 00:33:13,961
Look, if I put that in my Cosmo Fashion App, 

667
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,522
you'd probably get a D-.

668
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,001
Allen and his apps. He loves them.

669
00:33:18,002 --> 00:33:21,420
You know he's designed three of his own? One of them...Can I tell him?

670
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,966
One of them, you can take a picture of anybody's face,

671
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:26,866
and it'll tell you what the back of his head looks like.

672
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:28,436
Faceback.        Faceback.

673
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:30,864
Got some horrible reviews coming out of the gate.

674
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:32,102
It's gonna hit.        It's gonna catch.

675
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,235
Why are you with Allen?

676
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,514
I mean, that's not what I meant. I meant, how did you guys meet?

677
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,750
It's a really typical "how we met" story, Terry.

678
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,513
You're gonna be bored by it.

679
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:43,762
I was a dancer for the Knicks 

680
00:33:43,783 --> 00:33:46,581
while finishing my residency at Columbia Hospital.

681
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,221
Allen came into the ER with poison ivy on his rectum.

682
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:50,085
Yes.

683
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,822
Needless to say, I fell for him immediately.

684
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:57,463
We immediately spent the next three days at the La Quinta Inn,

685
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,534
and, to be honest, we didn't speak.        Three days

686
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,165
of not communicating once verbally.

687
00:34:03,474 --> 00:34:05,533
We had actually, without knowing it,

688
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:10,877
developed a language of eye flutters and non-verbal gestures.

689
00:34:11,115 --> 00:34:13,777
You know, Terry, it was just this primal connection.

690
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,896
After those three days of non-verbal communication 

691
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,213
and a whole lot of loving,

692
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,756
I had to go to a specialist to get my hips realigned.

693
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:26,790
Similar to operating on a German shepherd

694
00:34:27,532 --> 00:34:31,093
when they have hip dysplasia.        Very painful.

695
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:33,963
It's funny, it's like a scene from that one movie,

696
00:34:33,964 --> 00:34:35,464
 always forget the name of it.

697
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:36,733
With Meg Ryan.        Yes.

698
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:38,534
I don't remember a movie where Meg Ryan 

699
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,778
meets a guy with poison ivy up his ass.

700
00:34:39,877 --> 00:34:42,277
I'll think of it. I'll think of it.        Okay.

701
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,075
So, what about you, Terry? Do you have a girl?

702
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,139
I did, yeah.

703
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,718
We were supposed to get married, but she backed out. It's complicated.

704
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,161
Terry shot Derek Jeter.

705
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,755
Shut up, Allen. This was before.

706
00:34:51,755 --> 00:34:52,584
That's okay.

707
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,625
She's Got Mail. That's the name of the movie.

708
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,659
That's it! Honey!

709
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:57,869
With Tom Hanks?        Right.

710
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,987
And Meg Ryan.        Meg Ryan.

711
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,155
He didn't have poison ivy up his ass.

712
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,561
Yes, he did.        Yes, he did. Yeah.

713
00:35:01,632 --> 00:35:02,894
Way up there.

714
00:35:03,401 --> 00:35:05,995
Well, Terry, can't thank you enough for coming by. What a...

715
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,991
What a wonderful, lovely evening. Thank you.

716
00:35:07,992 --> 00:35:10,599
It was so, so nice meeting you, Terry.

717
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,495
It was my pleasure. Thank you.

718
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:16,003
And remember, all I ask of you is, you don't let him get hurt, Terry.

719
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,480
She tells me that every day before I leave.        Yep, I do.

720
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,649
I come downstairs and I make him his fresh-cut strawberries,

721
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:24,516
and I say, " Listen, my little sugar balls, whatever you do today,

722
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:25,919
"you just don't get hurt. "

723
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,521
Yeah. Every morning.

724
00:35:27,758 --> 00:35:31,550
And then I show him my breasts, and I say, " These are waiting for you

725
00:35:31,551 --> 00:35:32,455
"when you get back home. "        Right.

726
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,431
You know, Terry, they're not the biggest breasts he's ever seen,

727
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,934
but, man, are they perky.        Not by a long shot.

728
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,664
And they are firm, and they are yours.        You're a nice lady.

729
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,967
Thank you for coming.

730
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:48,000
Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Detectives Hoitz and Gamble? Over.

731
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:49,170
Go for Hoitz.

732
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,804
We found your red Prius.        Great.

733
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:52,975
It was trying to vote for Ralph Nader.

734
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:55,280
Come on.        Okay, sugar balls, listen up.

735
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,650
There's gonna be fingerprints on that car.

736
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:59,353
Tomorrow, we're gonna run those fingerprints through the system.

737
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:00,354
And if we get a hit, 

738
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,821
this case is gonna heat up faster than a junkie's spoon.

739
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,226
You do one thing when you wake up tomorrow, bring it.

740
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,387
Okay.        Thank you, Sheila.

741
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:07,555
He'll bring it.

742
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,292
Good night!        Good night.

743
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,698
Thank you, Sheila.

744
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:14,061
Bye, Terry!        Bye, Sheila! I'll never forget tonight.

745
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,969
Bye, Terry!        All right, Allen, whatever. Go inside.

746
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,132
Bye, Sheila!

747
00:36:17,208 --> 00:36:18,698
Night!        See you...See you, Terry!

748
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,667
Bye, Sheila.

749
00:36:24,649 --> 00:36:27,243
I don't know if he heard me. Bye, Terry!

750
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,909
Bye, Sheila!

751
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,759
Well, here she is. They left her under an overpass for the night.

752
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,522
You find anything?

753
00:36:38,596 --> 00:36:41,360
Yeah. We found a lot of stuff.

754
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,400
From bodily fluid and hair samples,

755
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,907
we determined that a bunch of old, homeless dudes 

756
00:36:45,908 --> 00:36:47,028
had an orgy in the car.

757
00:36:47,028 --> 00:36:48,868
Oh, God.        Yeah.

758
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,771
You know what that's called when they do that in there?

759
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,342
That's called a soup kitchen.

760
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,002
It's pretty rough stuff.

761
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:57,570
Not long after that, a mama raccoon came along

762
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,081
and gave birth on the floor.

763
00:36:59,917 --> 00:37:01,999
Placenta blew out all over the back window there.

764
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:05,281
Yeah, and then to top it all off, some joker comes along

765
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:08,650
takes himself a nifty little dump in the driver's seat.

766
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,722
I think he knew you guys were cops,

767
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:13,996
because this is what I would call a spite shit.

768
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,498
You were able to determine all of that

769
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,397
from the hair and fluid samples?        Oh, yeah.

770
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,717
What about fingerprints? You find any fingerprints?

771
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,332
Nope, couldn't get a one.        Found a cell phone.

772
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,434
Yeah, that's mine.

773
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,307
Any signs of a struggle or spent shells?

774
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,928
No. Believe me, everybody that was in on this orgy was more than willing.

775
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,973
In fact, they even left you a note here.

776
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:36,046
"Thanks for the F-shack. Love, Dirty Mike and the boys. "

777
00:37:36,086 --> 00:37:36,910
Here's something we found.

778
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:39,582
We found about a dozen unscratched lottery tickets.

779
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,817
No fingerprints or nothing. Check that out.

780
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:44,413
Yeah, it's a real shame, you know.

781
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:46,594
 I got myself a Prius. It's a hell of a machine.

782
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:50,133
It's my first brand-new car. I've never owned a new car.

783
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:51,964
Found a deer vagina.

784
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,338
What?        Thought it was human lips at first.

785
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:57,707
Then we took a closer look. It was definitely a deer vagina.

786
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,358
Not even a free ticket.

787
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,274
What are we gonna do?

788
00:38:03,381 --> 00:38:06,741
We got no fingerprints, a bunch of losing lottery tickets.

789
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:09,652
Look at this, there's a two-minute phone call made after we were jumped.

790
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,688
They used your phone?        They ghost dialed.

791
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:12,916
Someone probably sat on it.

792
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,192
It could have recorded some of 

793
00:38:14,193 --> 00:38:15,855
their conversation when Ershon got grabbed.

794
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,691
We gotta hear the other side of that call.

795
00:38:18,362 --> 00:38:19,727
Nope, no, it's nothing.

796
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:21,228
Nothing?        It's nothing.

797
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:22,232
It's the only lead we have.        It's nothing.

798
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,532
Why did you just get super jumpy?

799
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:25,727
What?

800
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,771
It's an ex-girlfriend, okay?

801
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,601
What's the matter? What happened with you guys?

802
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:31,538
She was just a bit of a handful, that's it.

803
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:38,771
Allen, it's the only lead we have.

804
00:38:38,772 --> 00:38:40,914
We either go with this or we walk away from this case right now.

805
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:43,385
Fine. Let's go see her.

806
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,562
Hello, Christinith.

807
00:38:57,635 --> 00:38:59,227
Hello, Allen.

808
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,403
That's my partner, Terry.        Hi, Telly.

809
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,605
Holy shit. Dude.        Just relax, relax.

810
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:13,382
I waited for you in Tower Records for four hours.

811
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:16,086
That was 13 years ago.

812
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:22,518
Arnold Palmer alert. Arnold Palmer alert.

813
00:39:22,519 --> 00:39:24,533
 Who wants some Arnie Palmies?

814
00:39:25,429 --> 00:39:27,021
Sweetie, this one has the vodky, right here.

815
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:30,294
Hal, just place it down, please.        All righty.

816
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:32,363
Okay.

817
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:41,638
I did things in bed with you that I haven't done with anyone since.

818
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:43,009
No.

819
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,489
Christinith, your husband, it's awkward.

820
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,656
Oh, no, he knows all of this.

821
00:39:46,691 --> 00:39:48,474
You're a lucky dog.        It's true.

822
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,387
Christine, this is a lovely house.

823
00:39:53,491 --> 00:39:56,817
It's Christinith. Are you stupid, or are you deaf?

824
00:39:56,818 --> 00:39:59,721
Christinith, you idiot!

825
00:39:59,763 --> 00:40:04,352
You come to our house, you get my wife's name right!

826
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:05,833
What?        Christinith!

827
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:08,667
Look, we really appreciate the hospitality.

828
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:11,167
We'd just love to get the message off your cell phone.

829
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,500
We believe it might give us information regarding a kidnapping.

830
00:40:15,215 --> 00:40:21,000
Okay. Why don't you come to the kitchen, and I will let you listen to it

831
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:24,511
and everyone else stay here.

832
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,350
Okay, sweetie.        Come on.

833
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:33,594
There's my phone.        Great, thank you for...

834
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:40,737
I hate you, you son of a bitch!

835
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:43,905
You're so strong.        I'm stronger than you will ever know!

836
00:40:43,974 --> 00:40:47,000
I hate you! I hate you!

837
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,603
You're so adorable. Look at your face. Look at your face.

838
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:54,717
You go, "I wuv you. " Say it. "I wuv you, Cwistinith. "

839
00:41:00,424 --> 00:41:04,861
You probably think because of the beard that I'm really hairy.

840
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,930
But I'm not.

841
00:41:08,332 --> 00:41:09,799
Shaved.

842
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,030
Allen!        He's fine.

843
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,197
Question.

844
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,399
What would you rather be,

845
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,243
a bear or a dog?

846
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,346
I don't care.        I wanna be

847
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,275
a bear dog. Half dog, half bear.

848
00:41:27,952 --> 00:41:30,318
'Cause that way, I could live in the house

849
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:33,957
but I still get to make a doodie out in the woods.

850
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:35,586
Allen!

851
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,354
Allen! Allen!

852
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:44,663
This is police evidence. Terry! Let's go!        Hey!

853
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:47,260
You get back here and you make love to my wife!

854
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:48,895
Allen! Allen!

855
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,267
I don't get it, man. I just do not get it.

856
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,607
I mean, that girl Christinith was seriously hot.

857
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:57,340
Your wife is crazy hot.

858
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:59,347
I mean, even that Brazilian security chick, 

859
00:41:59,348 --> 00:42:00,611
she threw you a "Do me" vibe.

860
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,151
What is it with you and hot ladies?

861
00:42:02,219 --> 00:42:05,936
First off, my wife is cute, but she's not hot.

862
00:42:05,939 --> 00:42:09,750
Dude, you're insane. Your wife is scalding hot.

863
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,626
You wanna listen to this message or not?        Yeah, whatever.

864
00:42:12,629 --> 00:42:13,896
You have one job, mate.

865
00:42:13,998 --> 00:42:16,289
Find a sucker to invest with you

866
00:42:16,290 --> 00:42:18,101
so you can pay my boss back the money you lost.

867
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:19,330
And I don't care who.

868
00:42:19,403 --> 00:42:21,735
Right. I actually think I found a sucker...

869
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,273
He's talking to Ershon. ...to invest $32 billion.

870
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,263
Who's got $32 billion to rob?

871
00:42:26,264 --> 00:42:28,273
Once I get the money, I'll falsify the records

872
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:31,176
to show their massive losses and then repay your employer.

873
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,911
Now, since you're following me, I need to go to 2300 Park Avenue,

874
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,577
and after that...

875
00:42:36,687 --> 00:42:38,450
I told you it wasn't a security team.

876
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:42,279
He was being abducted.        Obviously, but what kind...Holy...

877
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,550
Nobody leaves our house without making love to my wife!

878
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,787
Is that him?        Yeah!

879
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,692
Oh, my God, they came out of nowhere!

880
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,595
Holy shit!        They chased us 20 miles.

881
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:51,094
You come back here! You get back here!        Allen!

882
00:42:58,642 --> 00:43:02,237
2300 Park Avenue. It's the offices of the lottery.

883
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,675
Holy shit, the lottery tickets we found.

884
00:43:05,676 --> 00:43:08,183
Ershon is using the lottery money to cover his losses.

885
00:43:08,202 --> 00:43:11,205
$32 billion. That's the state's money.

886
00:43:11,208 --> 00:43:13,083
Well, what do we tell Mauch? A guy lost some money.

887
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:15,517
We have a scratchy cell phone message and an address. 

888
00:43:15,518 --> 00:43:17,700
It's still half a case.

889
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,687
There's gotta be some sort of paper trail. 

890
00:43:18,688 --> 00:43:20,424
If we can find that, if we can track it,

891
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:22,513
then we can go to Mauch.

892
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,759
So, I did some more research on Ershon's accounting firm,

893
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,566
and I found some pretty interesting stuff.

894
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,802
It turns out that Gretchel and Dawson has...

895
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,938
Hold on, I'm up.

896
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:39,306
I gave my love to Erin

897
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:43,947
She promised to be true

898
00:43:44,488 --> 00:43:48,481
I went to war to come back

899
00:43:48,592 --> 00:43:52,528
And find five British soldiers

900
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,827
Had their way with her

901
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,369
It was consensual

902
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:02,163
Done?

903
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:05,307
Gretchel and Dawson Accounting Firm in Fair Lawn, New Jersey

904
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,369
has only one client, David Ershon.

905
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,004
Pretty rinky-dink operation for a guy like that.

906
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,811
Looks like we're going to Jersey to visit an accounting firm.

907
00:44:13,884 --> 00:44:16,648
That's a shitty day.

908
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:21,949
And all their fathers were hanged

909
00:44:22,026 --> 00:44:25,484
And the children all got pink eye

910
00:44:27,564 --> 00:44:35,802
While their Harry Potter books were burned

911
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,758
Do you have fun singing those songs? They're really depressing.

912
00:44:42,759 --> 00:44:44,980
I do. They're full of rich history.

913
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,674
Damn it, I'm late. I was supposed to go meet my lady.

914
00:44:48,676 --> 00:44:50,652
I thought you said you guys split up.

915
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,246
Let's just keep our thing about work, okay?

916
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:54,915
All right. Goodbye, buddy.

917
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,016
Hey, get off me, man.

918
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:18,342
What the hell are you doing?

919
00:45:18,415 --> 00:45:21,389
I'm dancing, Terry. What the hell are you doing here?

920
00:45:21,395 --> 00:45:23,246
I love you, Francine.

921
00:45:23,353 --> 00:45:24,208
If you were with me, 

922
00:45:24,009 --> 00:45:26,785
you wouldn't be here in this strip club, shaking it for dollar bills!

923
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:31,718
This is a ballet studio, Terry. Okay? These poles are horizontal.

924
00:45:31,795 --> 00:45:33,854
He loves you very much, Francine.

925
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:36,749
Who is this guy?        What are you doing here, Allen?

926
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:38,094
It's the code. I'm your partner.

927
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:41,362
I'm here to support a friend and a work colleague.

928
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:42,928
Francine, is this guy bothering you?

929
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,997
Who's this, your new boyfriend? Great. You got a new boyfriend.

930
00:45:45,998 --> 00:45:49,412
He is my dance partner, Terry. Okay?

931
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,277
I know that this is a big surprise,

932
00:45:51,381 --> 00:45:54,444
but there are other things in the world besides being a cop. Okay?

933
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:57,752
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm gonna dance.

934
00:45:57,821 --> 00:45:59,918
What, you don't think I can do this shit?

935
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,665
That was surprisingly good, Terry.

936
00:46:18,666 --> 00:46:21,738
I love you, Francine.        You don't know what love is.

937
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,509
He loves you very much, Francine!

938
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:25,530
I heard it when he said it. Thank you.

939
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,677
You know what you're doing to me? You're killing me inside.

940
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,277
And don't eyeball me, man!

941
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,354
You're running around with this crack-dealing drug addict?

942
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:32,113
Terry!

943
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,084
He does not approve of your behavior!

944
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:35,959
Can you please go?

945
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,774
And you, too, creepy guy standing in the door?

946
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,660
Let's go, Allen.

947
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,694
I think we all experienced our own ballet today.

948
00:46:47,037 --> 00:46:48,834
The ballet of emotion and feelings.

949
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:50,864
You're kind of making things worse.

950
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,317
You okay?        Yeah, I'm fine.

951
00:47:04,755 --> 00:47:07,246
Hey, I didn't know you could dance.

952
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:10,660
We used to do those dance moves to make fun of guys when we were kids,

953
00:47:10,727 --> 00:47:12,092
show them how queer they were, okay?

954
00:47:14,031 --> 00:47:17,023
You learned to dance like that sarcastically?        Yeah, I guess.

955
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:20,661
Stay out of my personal life, okay? The kid flies private.

956
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,900
Stay focused on the case, man. I'll see you in Jersey tomorrow.

957
00:47:24,341 --> 00:47:25,899
All right, Terry.

958
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:30,038
Hey, that was liberating for me. I don't know how it felt for you.

959
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,936
Here, check this out. Article from six months ago.

960
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:57,597
Talking about how the lottery is looking

961
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,438
to invest their $30-billion fund more aggressively.

962
00:48:00,811 --> 00:48:02,097
So he's dealing drugs?

963
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:06,112
No, it's not drugs. This isn't Miami Vice.

964
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:11,050
Look, I'm sorry. I just...

965
00:48:11,755 --> 00:48:16,454
I am in a bit of a state today. Sheila and I got into it last night.

966
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,359
What happened?

967
00:48:20,264 --> 00:48:23,062
She was interested in taking this class at The Learning Annex, right?

968
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,634
Called "The Art of Oral Sex"?

969
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:28,599
You know, we just don't have it in the budget right now.

970
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:31,174
It's always about her.

971
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,543
Yeah, that's...That's messed up.

972
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,769
Hey, I got you a gift.

973
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,577
I just saw something, and I thought of you, 

974
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,590
and so, I don't want it to be weird.

975
00:48:41,591 --> 00:48:42,585
I just wanted to be nice.

976
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:43,683
Of course it's weird.

977
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,585
It's a grown man giving another man a present.

978
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:49,589
There you go. Open it up.

979
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:52,093
It's okay, you're welcome.

980
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:54,297
I like to do things like that.

981
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:55,560
Take a look what it says.

982
00:48:58,900 --> 00:48:59,700
FBI
FBI.

983
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,700
Female Body Inspector.

984
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:08,110
You know, because we're both in law enforcement.

985
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,769
We both like women.

986
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,872
But I got a weird sense of humor. I'm a sick puppy.

987
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:15,377
I can't look at it. It makes me laugh so hard.

988
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,749
Me, too.

989
00:49:20,157 --> 00:49:23,320
Real nice. You know, it's all class.

990
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:26,961
Okay.        Don't do that shit any more.

991
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:28,429
Yeah, believe me, I won't.

992
00:49:29,066 --> 00:49:31,364
Do you understand what's so funny about it, though?

993
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:36,831
'Cause it's the FBI, right? It has the same logo, the same shield.

994
00:49:36,836 --> 00:49:39,439
And at first glance, you're like, it's just a mug that says "FBI."

995
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:44,674
But then at second glance, you're like, "Female Body Inspector"?

996
00:49:44,748 --> 00:49:47,109
Get out of town. This is outrageous...

997
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,279
Shut up!

998
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,027
I'm gonna climb over that anger wall of yours

999
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,192
one of these days,

1000
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,428
and it's gonna be glorious.

1001
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,005
Shouldn't we tell Mauch that we're going to check this place out?

1002
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:14,291
For what? We're just going to check it out.

1003
00:50:14,292 --> 00:50:15,876
I know, but it's procedure.

1004
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:19,074
Terry answers to no one.

1005
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:21,911
I do what I do.

1006
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:25,821
What accounting firm is closed at 11:00 a. m. On a Tuesday?

1007
00:50:25,822 --> 00:50:26,801
This is a shithole.

1008
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:35,489
I love bombs.

1009
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,762
I can't hear! I can't hear!

1010
00:50:40,237 --> 00:50:42,228
There's blood blisters on my hands!

1011
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:43,397
Oh, my God!

1012
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,771
How do they walk away in movies without flinching

1013
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,571
when it explodes behind them?

1014
00:50:47,644 --> 00:50:51,119
There's no way! I call bullshit on that!

1015
00:50:51,248 --> 00:50:54,581
When they flew the Millennium Falcon outside of the Death Star,

1016
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:58,924
and it was followed by the explosion, that was bullshit!

1017
00:50:58,925 --> 00:51:02,020
Don't you dare badmouth Star Wars! That was all accurate!

1018
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:04,093
I need an MRI.

1019
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,461
I need an MRI! I've got soft tissue damage.

1020
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,617
There's no way I don't have soft tissue damage.

1021
00:51:11,618 --> 00:51:12,300
Please stop.

1022
00:51:12,301 --> 00:51:15,031
I just wanna go somewhere and breastfeed right now!

1023
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:19,874
Fire Department said it was a gas leak, 

1024
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,029
but no way. That was timed.

1025
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,523
They didn't wanna kill us, but they wanted to scare us.

1026
00:51:24,524 --> 00:51:26,939
Yeah, well, they succeeded, okay?

1027
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,645
I'm tired of this. All right?

1028
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:32,279
I'm tired of explosions and people pointing guns at me.

1029
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:34,482
I wanna go back to my desk.

1030
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:38,050
Guess what? Life gets loud sometimes and messes with your ears.

1031
00:51:38,161 --> 00:51:40,729
You can't escape it by hiding at your desk for your whole life.

1032
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:43,461
You know what? Yes, you can. I've done it for years, okay?

1033
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:46,468
There's no explosions at my desk.

1034
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:51,473
There's no explosions at my home with my plain wife, in my plain house.

1035
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,539
What are you afraid of, man?

1036
00:51:56,680 --> 00:52:01,174
I'm your partner. You can tell me. What the hell are you hiding from?

1037
00:52:01,918 --> 00:52:04,284
I was a sophomore in college.

1038
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,750
The university I went to decided they needed to raise tuition.

1039
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:12,518
A classmate of mine, Brenda, 

1040
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:16,731
in an effort to raise money and stay in school,

1041
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,768
came up with a nifty plan

1042
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:21,603
where she thought she'd date guys and charge them money.

1043
00:52:21,604 --> 00:52:23,063
I go on dates all the time,

1044
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,267
with a whole bunch of, you know, boys and stuff.

1045
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,508
And I kind of need somebody to help me out, 

1046
00:52:27,509 --> 00:52:29,211
like, you know, my partner in crime.

1047
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:31,543
Yeah, I could make a schedule.

1048
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,207
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking.

1049
00:52:33,283 --> 00:52:35,808
Provide transportation services.        Yeah, yeah.

1050
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:38,246
It's gonna be a good time.        Thanks so much for asking me.

1051
00:52:38,247 --> 00:52:40,589
She said she needed my help to make sure that the dates went okay

1052
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,115
and that the guys paid her. She said she'd give me a percentage.

1053
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,492
Oh, my God. You were a pimp.        What? God, no.

1054
00:52:47,597 --> 00:52:49,656
No, I was just trying to help a friend.

1055
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,326
We started making a lot of money.

1056
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:56,237
And wouldn't you know it, some of Brenda's girlfriends

1057
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:59,002
decided they wanted to be a part of it.

1058
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:01,771
Pretty soon, there were about 14 ladies that I was protecting

1059
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,472
while they gave me money.

1060
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,394
That's called a stable of whores.

1061
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,011
We decided I shouldn't use my real name.

1062
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,954
 So we came up with the name "Gator. "

1063
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,655
I'm telling you, you were a pimp.

1064
00:53:12,756 --> 00:53:15,350
No! Are you even listening to the story?

1065
00:53:18,161 --> 00:53:20,304
Anyway, one day, I wake up and I look in the mirror,

1066
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,594
and I don't like what I see.

1067
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,860
I mean, I had gotten out of control, and I didn't even realize it.

1068
00:53:28,171 --> 00:53:30,503
You can't have a conscience in the pimp game.

1069
00:53:31,274 --> 00:53:33,003
One night, two of my favorite girls,

1070
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,304
Candy and Jolene, said, "We gotta take you in,"

1071
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,676
and they dropped me off at the emergency room.

1072
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,961
That's where I met Sheila. I was a mess.

1073
00:53:40,402 --> 00:53:42,227
I made a promise to myself and to her 

1074
00:53:42,228 --> 00:53:44,273
that I would never get out of control again.

1075
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:47,187
So, as soon as I graduated from college,

1076
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:50,191
I became an accountant for the police department.

1077
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:53,523
The most stable job I could think of.

1078
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,531
An accountant for law and order.

1079
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:03,897
I just don't wanna ever feel out of control like that ever again.

1080
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,703
Don't worry. I got your back.

1081
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:09,510
Now I say we go get in Ershon's grill and see if he cracks.

1082
00:54:09,511 --> 00:54:13,078
I'm tired of all this tippy-toeing around.        Okay.

1083
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:16,446
You can either walk the plank or take your panties off.

1084
00:54:16,447 --> 00:54:17,846
The choice is yours.

1085
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,898
I want to take my panties off.

1086
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,787
You've made a wise choice, you have.

1087
00:54:22,788 --> 00:54:24,161
Mr. Ershon, Detective Gamble 

1088
00:54:24,162 --> 00:54:26,690
and the officer who shot Derek Jeter are here.

1089
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,859
Gentlemen, please.

1090
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,231
Remember us, hotshot?        Of course I do. Please, sit.

1091
00:54:32,335 --> 00:54:33,996
There she blows.

1092
00:54:36,406 --> 00:54:39,671
Two of those Russian waters, please. No lime wedges, just cucumber.

1093
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:42,871
Guess where we just came from? An explosion at your accounting office.

1094
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:45,443
Yes, that awful gas leak.

1095
00:54:45,548 --> 00:54:46,531
Gas leak? 

1096
00:54:46,921 --> 00:54:49,621
The only gas leak is the one coming out of your mouth right now.

1097
00:54:49,621 --> 00:54:54,580
I just thank God no one was hurt or injured in a bad way.

1098
00:54:54,691 --> 00:54:57,587
I absolutely abhor death.

1099
00:54:57,627 --> 00:55:01,085
Hey, Andrew Lloyd Webber. The jig is up, okay?

1100
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:03,388
We know that wasn't your security team that grabbed you.

1101
00:55:03,389 --> 00:55:05,865
And we know you're targeting a big fish to cover losses.

1102
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:08,220
You talk or I beat you so it don't show no bruises.

1103
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:10,335
God, this water is good.

1104
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,913
Terry, have you tried the water?        Shut up Allen

1105
00:55:13,025 --> 00:55:16,290
I assure you I have no idea what you're talking about

1106
00:55:16,395 --> 00:55:18,942
I understand there was a bit of a mix-up 

1107
00:55:18,943 --> 00:55:20,298
with the whole scaffolding business.

1108
00:55:20,399 --> 00:55:25,803
The cucumber accents the water in such a way that...

1109
00:55:26,972 --> 00:55:28,690
Perhaps by way of apology, 

1110
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:31,706
I can offer you my personal courtside seats

1111
00:55:31,777 --> 00:55:35,941
for the Knicks game, with access to the Ambassador Club.

1112
00:55:38,317 --> 00:55:40,645
Come on, Knicks! Come on! 

1113
00:55:40,749 --> 00:55:43,449
I got Knicks' fever and it's catching!

1114
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:48,817
Hey. This feels weird sitting here. It feels like it's a bribe.

1115
00:55:48,927 --> 00:55:53,455
It is a bribe. Son-of-a-bitch, I saw courtside and I went blind.

1116
00:55:53,565 --> 00:55:54,827
come on

1117
00:55:55,668 --> 00:55:56,999
call me

1118
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,267
Excuse me.        That was a trick.

1119
00:56:00,339 --> 00:56:01,738
No more

1120
00:56:01,807 --> 00:56:07,177
Gentlemen, you have a choice. Mamma Mia or Jersey Boys.

1121
00:56:10,516 --> 00:56:13,576
Fantastic! You're so unbelievable!

1122
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:19,990
Damn it. He did it again.

1123
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:23,257
Excuse me.        No more tickets.

1124
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:25,262
Mr. Ershon, I tried to keep them in the waiting room.

1125
00:56:25,330 --> 00:56:28,595
That's okay, Susan. Two Glacier waters with Mediterranean limes.

1126
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:30,532
No, no, no. No more water. We're not here for that.

1127
00:56:30,636 --> 00:56:32,661
No, I was very much looking forward to having a water.

1128
00:56:32,771 --> 00:56:37,208
How great is Jersey Boys?        It's not great. It's fantastic!

1129
00:56:37,309 --> 00:56:40,642
You totally undersold it. The pageantry, the costumes.

1130
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:42,340
Wow, what a musical.

1131
00:56:42,448 --> 00:56:44,313
Hey. Get over here.

1132
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:46,611
What's wrong with you?        What?

1133
00:56:46,685 --> 00:56:48,175
That's not what we're here for.

1134
00:56:49,121 --> 00:56:51,180
We're gonna do good cop, bad cop. Okay?

1135
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,516
It's the oldest game in the book for a reason, it works.

1136
00:56:54,626 --> 00:56:56,457
I come strong, then you come in.

1137
00:56:56,458 --> 00:56:57,320
You got it?        Yeah.

1138
00:56:57,326 --> 00:56:59,858
I come strong, then you come in.        Right. Got it.

1139
00:56:59,965 --> 00:57:01,865
Now you listen to me, you piece of shit.

1140
00:57:02,134 --> 00:57:04,694
It's just you and me, and I'm gonna rip you apart!

1141
00:57:04,803 --> 00:57:06,701
How did you cover your losses up? 

1142
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:09,002
What drug cartel are you working with now?

1143
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:13,010
Okay, I'll talk to you, you're reasonable!        No, no, look at me!

1144
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:15,546
You wanna talk to me? You wanna talk to me?

1145
00:57:15,647 --> 00:57:19,139
Allen, what are you doing? What are you doing? Allen!

1146
00:57:19,985 --> 00:57:22,475
I'm gonna make you eat a plate of human shit!

1147
00:57:22,888 --> 00:57:24,685
Get away from me!

1148
00:57:29,394 --> 00:57:30,861
Where is he?

1149
00:57:32,898 --> 00:57:35,492
Look, I'm really sorry about that.

1150
00:57:36,335 --> 00:57:38,860
I saw how aggressive you were being, and I thought,

1151
00:57:38,937 --> 00:57:41,479
"Wow, I gotta go even bigger than that, 

1152
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:42,667
"since we're doing bad cop, bad cop. "

1153
00:57:42,674 --> 00:57:44,104
What? No, I said, 

1154
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:47,738
"Good cop, bad cop. " I'm the bad cop, you're the good cop.

1155
00:57:47,846 --> 00:57:49,374
Okay, then there it is. 

1156
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:52,450
That's it. I thought you said, "Bad cop, bad cop. "

1157
00:57:52,584 --> 00:57:56,020
Well, while you were going crazy, look what I snagged from his desk.

1158
00:57:56,088 --> 00:57:58,181
Think it's his phone sheet.        Nice.

1159
00:57:58,524 --> 00:58:00,219
Seven calls to the lottery office.

1160
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:02,083
That could be the evidence we need for Mauch.

1161
00:58:04,863 --> 00:58:07,730
Get back. Colombian drug lords.        Where are you getting that from?

1162
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,729
Jeesus

1163
00:58:19,545 --> 00:58:21,979
Can you imagine where you'd be in your career if you hadn't shot Jeter?

1164
00:58:29,788 --> 00:58:31,224
We call this in, right?

1165
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,122
Looks like we got all the evidence we need.

1166
00:58:33,225 --> 00:58:35,284
I'm sorry, my butterfly.

1167
00:58:36,662 --> 00:58:39,597
We'll load them up, send them back to go.

1168
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,639
Holy shit.        What?

1169
00:58:51,743 --> 00:58:54,439
What do you mean, what? Where are we?

1170
00:58:55,814 --> 00:58:57,247
We're in the high desert.

1171
00:58:57,316 --> 00:59:01,082
They took my shoes again, man! What the hell is it with taking shoes?

1172
00:59:01,153 --> 00:59:02,677
They took your wooden gun?        Yeah.

1173
00:59:09,261 --> 00:59:11,491
Hello?        Hello, Gene? I mean, Captain.

1174
00:59:11,597 --> 00:59:12,996
Captain, it's Allen Gamble.

1175
00:59:13,098 --> 00:59:14,929
Yeah, yeah. Where are you? What's going on?

1176
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,798
Captain, it's a long story, but I'm just gonna cut to the chase.

1177
00:59:17,799 --> 00:59:19,337
We are in Las Vegas, all right?

1178
00:59:19,438 --> 00:59:20,789
We were kidnapped, 

1179
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:22,956
put on a freight train, and shipped out here.

1180
00:59:22,975 --> 00:59:25,309
Let me just stop you right there. Don't bullshit me.

1181
00:59:25,377 --> 00:59:26,976
Captain, I am being straight with you.

1182
00:59:26,995 --> 00:59:29,177
Look, we think something's going on, okay?

1183
00:59:29,281 --> 00:59:32,348
We think Ershon is targeting the lottery to cover his losses.

1184
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:37,755
Wait. How many times did I explicitly say to you, "Lay off Ershon"?

1185
00:59:38,156 --> 00:59:39,453
Terry, Captain wants to know

1186
00:59:39,524 --> 00:59:41,758
how many times has he asked us to lay off of Ershon.

1187
00:59:41,826 --> 00:59:42,818
Twice.

1188
00:59:43,462 --> 00:59:45,525
Twice. Terry says twice. I agree.

1189
00:59:45,530 --> 00:59:47,389
I'm hanging up. I'm done.

1190
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:54,764
I gotta tell you, I started getting a hand for that, 

1191
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,607
a taste for that Pai Gow.

1192
00:59:56,909 --> 01:00:01,505
Martin and Fosse, super cops, in three, two...

1193
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:07,485
So, we busted that junkie. Got back 74 thou in diamonds. 74 thou.

1194
01:00:08,587 --> 01:00:10,020
Solved the Castien case.

1195
01:00:10,088 --> 01:00:12,886
$74,000? That's all they took?

1196
01:00:12,991 --> 01:00:15,221
There's millions of dollars of diamonds in that place.

1197
01:00:15,327 --> 01:00:17,488
How about this, Gamble? How about you shut your face?

1198
01:00:17,562 --> 01:00:19,154
All right? Just shut it.

1199
01:00:19,231 --> 01:00:21,258
Hoitz, Gamble, Captain's looking for you.

1200
01:00:23,835 --> 01:00:26,065
I know it's off the subject, but is Kevlar copyrighted?

1201
01:00:26,171 --> 01:00:27,433
Captain?        Yeah.

1202
01:00:27,539 --> 01:00:30,030
Is it a bad time?        No, come on. Come on.

1203
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:32,240
Not me, right?        Yeah, and you.

1204
01:00:32,344 --> 01:00:34,439
Fellows, I'm sure you're familiar 

1205
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:36,467
with the venerable DA Radford.

1206
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,075
He wanted to come down and pay us a visit.

1207
01:00:38,083 --> 01:00:39,111
Hello, gentlemen.

1208
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:40,343
Hello, sir.        Hey.

1209
01:00:40,419 --> 01:00:43,786
You know, I was talking to Gene here.        He prefers "Captain. "

1210
01:00:43,889 --> 01:00:47,381
Yes, I was talking to Gene here, and, you know, it's funny.

1211
01:00:47,693 --> 01:00:49,923
I don't know what you two have been up to,

1212
01:00:50,028 --> 01:00:53,795
but I've been getting calls from people I don't ever get calls from.

1213
01:00:53,796 --> 01:00:56,400
In 40 years of enforcing the law, I've learned one thing.

1214
01:00:57,035 --> 01:00:59,280
When that happens, stop.

1215
01:01:00,305 --> 01:01:03,399
Gene, how's the family?        Good, good, Louis, thanks for asking.

1216
01:01:03,475 --> 01:01:05,466
My son's bisexual, so...        Tremendous.

1217
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:10,484
Gentlemen, do we understand each other?

1218
01:01:11,116 --> 01:01:13,277
Cut the crap!        Will do.

1219
01:01:17,656 --> 01:01:19,089
Guy never comes down here.

1220
01:01:19,157 --> 01:01:21,990
Twenty years, I think I've seen that guy in this building one time.

1221
01:01:22,094 --> 01:01:25,257
He's a heavyweight cat, that guy.        He was sitting right here.

1222
01:01:25,664 --> 01:01:29,100
Yeah. I think you missed the point. Anyway, look.

1223
01:01:29,167 --> 01:01:32,231
Blue and white found your firearms down by the Hudson River. 

1224
01:01:32,232 --> 01:01:33,294
Here you go, Terry.

1225
01:01:34,329 --> 01:01:35,762
You know what?

1226
01:01:36,441 --> 01:01:38,409
I'm gonna hang on to the wooden gun.

1227
01:01:38,477 --> 01:01:40,342
To give me back my real gun?        No.

1228
01:01:40,445 --> 01:01:42,504
'Cause I'm gonna give you this.

1229
01:01:43,248 --> 01:01:46,411
It's a rape whistle. You blow that if you run into any trouble

1230
01:01:47,019 --> 01:01:49,579
and someone with an actual gun will come and help you out.

1231
01:01:50,956 --> 01:01:53,570
We were abducted, Captain! This shit is real! 

1232
01:01:53,571 --> 01:01:55,969
Ershon's dirty. He's targeting the lottery!

1233
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:57,801
Next, I want you guys to hand in 

1234
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:00,598
all the evidence you think you have to the SEC.

1235
01:02:00,665 --> 01:02:02,596
The financial district's under their jurisdiction.

1236
01:02:02,601 --> 01:02:05,169
Don't you get it? This case is talking to us!

1237
01:02:05,187 --> 01:02:08,265
I'm a peacock, Captain! You gotta let me fly on this one!

1238
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:11,241
You know what, Terry? Let's just settle this. Peacocks don't fly.

1239
01:02:11,309 --> 01:02:14,767
They fly, they fly a little bit.        Yeah, about as much as a penguin.

1240
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:18,475
One more thing, do me a favor, don't go chasing waterfalls.

1241
01:02:19,184 --> 01:02:21,944
Was that accidental, or were you trying to quote TLC on purpose?

1242
01:02:22,587 --> 01:02:23,645
I don't even understand the reference.

1243
01:02:24,189 --> 01:02:26,416
You don't understand what you said?        I don't know what that is.

1244
01:02:26,425 --> 01:02:27,858
Get out.        Go.

1245
01:02:38,603 --> 01:02:40,833
How did they get that story?

1246
01:02:42,374 --> 01:02:45,343
I'm tired of being treated like a jerk for trying to do the right thing.

1247
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:46,502
Hey, guys.

1248
01:02:46,878 --> 01:02:50,780
There's a proxy vote for a big reinvestment of the pension coming up,

1249
01:02:50,849 --> 01:02:53,716
so if you just wanna come by the old...        Damn it, Bob!

1250
01:02:53,819 --> 01:02:54,877
Let me ask you something.

1251
01:02:54,986 --> 01:02:57,386
What do you even do around here besides interrupt people?

1252
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:00,490
Well, I serve as treasurer to the union.

1253
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:03,392
I make a wicked pot of decaf.

1254
01:03:03,495 --> 01:03:07,026
Exactly! You're a worthless piece of shit!

1255
01:03:08,667 --> 01:03:12,194
Probably right, Terry. That's why I feel so sad all the time.

1256
01:03:13,105 --> 01:03:14,902
I'm gonna go for a walk.

1257
01:03:15,006 --> 01:03:16,268
Bob!        Say something.

1258
01:03:16,374 --> 01:03:18,239
Come on! Bob!

1259
01:03:18,343 --> 01:03:21,294
I didn't mean it, all right? I'm upset.

1260
01:03:39,064 --> 01:03:44,161
Actually, we don't do that here. This is an installation art piece.

1261
01:03:44,536 --> 01:03:46,879
This coffee table?        Yes. We don't put drinks on it.

1262
01:03:50,408 --> 01:03:53,370
Five hundred thousand?        He can read! Congratulations.

1263
01:03:53,545 --> 01:03:55,706
What?        I'm sorry, are you in the right place?

1264
01:03:55,780 --> 01:03:58,078
Or not? I'm...

1265
01:03:59,284 --> 01:04:00,478
Terry.        Does he... Okay.

1266
01:04:00,552 --> 01:04:03,817
Well...        Sorry. Terry! What are you doing here?

1267
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:09,425
I want to be with you.        No, Terry, that's not gonna happen.

1268
01:04:09,794 --> 01:04:12,722
You know where you belong. On top of me in the Poconos.

1269
01:04:13,265 --> 01:04:15,290
Instead, you're here selling dirty coffee tables?

1270
01:04:15,467 --> 01:04:17,025
I mean, look at this. This is nonsense!

1271
01:04:17,102 --> 01:04:19,976
Terry, this is an original Haverfield-Jameson.

1272
01:04:19,977 --> 01:04:24,253
The chaos of the coffee table? It represents our fractured egos.

1273
01:04:24,576 --> 01:04:26,567
You think I don't know about this artsy-fartsy crap?

1274
01:04:26,945 --> 01:04:28,837
This coffee table isn't the ego. 

1275
01:04:28,838 --> 01:04:31,406
It represents our shattered sense of community

1276
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:33,713
in the face of capitalist-driven isolation.

1277
01:04:33,818 --> 01:04:35,725
Looks like the work of Cindy Sherman 

1278
01:04:35,726 --> 01:04:36,597
or Frank Stella.

1279
01:04:37,055 --> 01:04:38,702
How did you know that, Terry?

1280
01:04:38,823 --> 01:04:40,291
I took some classes at RISD

1281
01:04:40,292 --> 01:04:42,674
so I could make fun of these lame artsy douches in my neighborhood.

1282
01:04:42,694 --> 01:04:45,094
Terry, lower your voice!        I don't have to lower my voice.

1283
01:04:45,163 --> 01:04:46,618
Is this man bothering you?

1284
01:04:46,619 --> 01:04:48,292
Are you actually having sex with this creep?

1285
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,131
Terry, he's gay. Okay?

1286
01:04:51,403 --> 01:04:54,065
He's even wearing a T-shirt that says, "I'm gay"!

1287
01:04:54,339 --> 01:04:56,454
All right? And also, he is my boss.

1288
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:57,701
Happy for you, man. Good.

1289
01:04:57,776 --> 01:04:59,641
Can you get out of here now? I'm talking to my lady.

1290
01:04:59,844 --> 01:05:03,177
Mr. Reger, everything is fine. Terry is actually leaving now.

1291
01:05:03,615 --> 01:05:05,674
Nice toot, sailor.        Jesus.

1292
01:05:06,918 --> 01:05:08,852
Terry, what are you doing?

1293
01:05:09,354 --> 01:05:12,755
Look, I waited three years for you to be more than a cop, okay?

1294
01:05:13,091 --> 01:05:14,319
Just give me one more year.

1295
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:17,309
Terry, you don't get another year. I'm done.

1296
01:05:17,662 --> 01:05:18,720
Fine.

1297
01:05:19,197 --> 01:05:22,394
Terry, don't touch that! Terry!        Oh, my God!

1298
01:05:22,734 --> 01:05:24,668
I don't need this shit. I don't need you!

1299
01:05:25,670 --> 01:05:28,003
And when you call me, I'm not coming back!

1300
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:32,400
Oh, boy! Over the top!        How outr?

1301
01:05:32,477 --> 01:05:35,044
I'll burn this bitch down to the ground!

1302
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:38,712
Fresh! Energetic!        I love his rawness!

1303
01:05:38,717 --> 01:05:42,144
Stop critiquing me, okay? I'm a human being! I'm not a piece of art!

1304
01:05:42,454 --> 01:05:44,285
Yes, you are.        Bravo!

1305
01:05:44,623 --> 01:05:47,319
I'm a peacock flying into a rainbow!

1306
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:50,486
Yes! Yes!

1307
01:05:59,704 --> 01:06:02,298
These braised short ribs taste like a dog's asshole.

1308
01:06:02,407 --> 01:06:04,202
Sweetie.        You know what, I'm sitting here thinking,

1309
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:07,372
"Who in the world would slow roast a dog's asshole

1310
01:06:07,445 --> 01:06:09,413
"and serve it to their husband?"

1311
01:06:09,481 --> 01:06:12,917
You would.        You are being awful. What's wrong?

1312
01:06:12,984 --> 01:06:17,717
Captain took us off the case.        I'm sorry.

1313
01:06:18,623 --> 01:06:21,512
I told Terry about my dark days in college, 

1314
01:06:21,513 --> 01:06:23,724
and it brought up some feelings.

1315
01:06:23,862 --> 01:06:26,917
Well, honeydick, that was a long time ago. 

1316
01:06:27,546 --> 01:06:29,396
You're not that same person you were.

1317
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:32,736
No, you don't get it. There is a darkness inside of me.

1318
01:06:32,737 --> 01:06:35,729
It wants to get out. It wants to walk around.

1319
01:06:35,807 --> 01:06:38,935
It wants some walking around money, and it wants to buy some shoes.

1320
01:06:39,044 --> 01:06:41,624
And it wants to walk up with the people and say,

1321
01:06:41,625 --> 01:06:43,989
 "Hey, Gator don't play no shit. "

1322
01:06:44,024 --> 01:06:45,280
You feel me?        Yeah.

1323
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:49,444
Gator never been about that, never been about playing no shit.

1324
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,481
Sweetie, I'm sorry.        It's okay.

1325
01:06:55,126 --> 01:06:58,493
I just...        Remember that night we met?

1326
01:06:59,264 --> 01:07:01,634
The attending physician told me, 

1327
01:07:01,840 --> 01:07:04,329
"We got a drugged-out pimp in the back. "

1328
01:07:04,669 --> 01:07:08,105
And I went back there, and I pulled open that curtain,

1329
01:07:10,475 --> 01:07:13,357
You were weak, scared,

1330
01:07:13,378 --> 01:07:17,474
ass up, inflamed, crying.

1331
01:07:17,582 --> 01:07:19,292
At that moment, I knew. 

1332
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,680
"Hey, he's no pimp. Pimps don't cry. "

1333
01:07:23,655 --> 01:07:28,149
Pimps don't cry

1334
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:31,986
Pimps don't cry

1335
01:07:32,097 --> 01:07:34,998
No they do not

1336
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:38,336
They don't shed a tear

1337
01:07:39,037 --> 01:07:44,373
Pimps don't cry

1338
01:07:44,642 --> 01:07:46,542
They never shed a tear

1339
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:52,819
Come lay with me. 

1340
01:07:52,820 --> 01:07:54,886
Be safe, and let's make love. Come on.

1341
01:07:54,986 --> 01:07:57,386
Every time you say, "Be safe," it tears me apart.

1342
01:07:57,489 --> 01:08:00,049
You gotta let me be who I'm gonna be.

1343
01:08:01,659 --> 01:08:04,150
Allen, I'm pregnant.

1344
01:08:05,029 --> 01:08:06,394
Whose baby is that?

1345
01:08:06,498 --> 01:08:08,128
Who's the man who did that to you? 

1346
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:10,497
Gator's bitches better be using jimmies!

1347
01:08:11,803 --> 01:08:15,463
I'm sorry. See, that's what I'm talking about.

1348
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:16,865
Oh, my God.

1349
01:08:18,476 --> 01:08:19,875
You need to leave.

1350
01:08:19,978 --> 01:08:23,573
Get out! Get out, Allen! Get out!

1351
01:08:40,365 --> 01:08:41,263
Hey

1352
01:08:42,534 --> 01:08:45,059
Hey. What are you doing here?

1353
01:08:47,539 --> 01:08:49,270
Come here when I have lady troubles, 

1354
01:08:50,140 --> 01:08:52,603
which means I come here about every night.

1355
01:08:52,710 --> 01:08:54,735
What are you doing here?

1356
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:58,405
Sheila and I got into it tonight.

1357
01:08:59,284 --> 01:09:01,582
She threw me out.

1358
01:09:02,620 --> 01:09:03,869
Well, you're not a cop 

1359
01:09:03,870 --> 01:09:05,681
till your wife throws you out of the house, partner.

1360
01:09:05,757 --> 01:09:07,767
Does it bother you that the Castien robbers 

1361
01:09:07,768 --> 01:09:10,093
only took 74 grand in diamonds?

1362
01:09:10,128 --> 01:09:12,396
They're junkies. Who cares? I mean...

1363
01:09:12,464 --> 01:09:16,264
I don't know if a junkie can go down a 20-story zipline, though.

1364
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:17,815
How are you going?

1365
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:22,100
We're about to have us a little screw party in this red Prius over here

1366
01:09:22,207 --> 01:09:23,401
if you wanna join us.

1367
01:09:23,508 --> 01:09:25,867
You're not going anywhere near that Prius, okay?

1368
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:28,777
Here's what we're talking about. We're talking about a bunch of hobos

1369
01:09:29,214 --> 01:09:31,148
with fingers in each other's pooper

1370
01:09:31,216 --> 01:09:34,014
in a stranger's car with talk radio playing really loud.

1371
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:35,545
It's gonna be a nice evening.

1372
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,918
Well, we're not participating in that. We have no interest.

1373
01:09:38,122 --> 01:09:39,214
Let me rephrase it.

1374
01:09:39,624 --> 01:09:42,457
We got a jar of old mustard, and we got a poodle,

1375
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:45,973
and we're just get in there and we're gonna put some D's in some A's.

1376
01:09:46,164 --> 01:09:48,095
Hey, are you Dirty Mike and the boys?

1377
01:09:48,116 --> 01:09:50,791
How do you know who we are?        You left a note in that car.

1378
01:09:50,802 --> 01:09:53,262
Police, shithead.        He's a copper. We gotta go. Come on!

1379
01:09:53,371 --> 01:09:55,592
Hey! Goose it, boys! They're cops!

1380
01:09:55,673 --> 01:09:57,436
Rub your dicks on the car as you're running away!

1381
01:09:57,509 --> 01:09:59,841
You turned my beautiful Prius into a nightmare!

1382
01:09:59,944 --> 01:10:03,607
We are gonna have sex in your car! It will happen again!

1383
01:10:05,750 --> 01:10:07,445
I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight.

1384
01:10:07,519 --> 01:10:09,316
Fortunately, I know where you're gonna be drinking.

1385
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,752
Jack of All Trades. Drinks on me. Come on.

1386
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:13,985
No, I already have a beer.        No, no, no, no.

1387
01:10:14,325 --> 01:10:16,657
I'm talking about doing some serious drinking.

1388
01:10:16,761 --> 01:10:18,092
Drinking with Terry Hoitz.

1389
01:11:06,978 --> 01:11:08,943
This sucks, man. Work our ass off on this case,

1390
01:11:08,963 --> 01:11:10,705
now we gotta hand over all of our evidence?

1391
01:11:10,732 --> 01:11:11,844
Yeah, it's not right.

1392
01:11:11,916 --> 01:11:13,975
Oh, my God, I'm hungover.

1393
01:11:16,321 --> 01:11:17,417
So, you guys are law enforcement?

1394
01:11:17,789 --> 01:11:19,723
Yeah, we're an independent government agency who,

1395
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:21,691
along with the FBI and the Federal Reserve,

1396
01:11:21,759 --> 01:11:24,380
regulate the stock market and corporate fraud.

1397
01:11:24,382 --> 01:11:27,190
And the Federal Reserve is a prison?

1398
01:11:27,191 --> 01:11:29,895
No, basically, it's a held-for-profit bank that sets interest rates

1399
01:11:29,968 --> 01:11:31,494
and loans money to other banks.

1400
01:11:31,936 --> 01:11:34,131
Is that a wastebasket?        Yeah, right there.

1401
01:11:34,238 --> 01:11:35,603
Thank you.

1402
01:11:37,308 --> 01:11:40,641
You all right?        Holy hell!

1403
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,975
I'm so sorry.

1404
01:11:44,582 --> 01:11:46,347
I got so drunk last night.

1405
01:11:46,350 --> 01:11:49,918
I think I thought a tube of toothpaste was astronaut food.

1406
01:11:50,989 --> 01:11:52,786
Come on in, fellas.

1407
01:11:53,891 --> 01:11:56,086
You gotta be kidding me. You're Ershon's lawyer.

1408
01:11:56,160 --> 01:11:58,223
We're turning over our investigation to you?

1409
01:11:58,329 --> 01:12:00,593
Let me assure you there will be no conflict of interestewx

1410
01:12:00,665 --> 01:12:02,132
between me and David Ershon.

1411
01:12:02,233 --> 01:12:04,647
And if this were an actual investigation, 

1412
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:06,680
I would immediately recuse myself.

1413
01:12:06,687 --> 01:12:09,075
This is all the evidence we have, 

1414
01:12:09,140 --> 01:12:10,970
and I truly hope you take this seriously.

1415
01:12:10,975 --> 01:12:12,352
Yes. Very much so.

1416
01:12:12,353 --> 01:12:13,906
From everything I've heard, I understand

1417
01:12:13,978 --> 01:12:17,243
you guys are the best at these types of investigations.

1418
01:12:17,315 --> 01:12:20,379
Outside of Enron and AIG

1419
01:12:20,381 --> 01:12:22,018
and Bernie Madoff,

1420
01:12:22,253 --> 01:12:24,949
WorldCom, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers.

1421
01:12:25,023 --> 01:12:26,923
Okay. Thank you. Thank you, Detective.

1422
01:12:26,991 --> 01:12:28,788
Would you like a seat, or you're fine?        No, I'm good.

1423
01:12:28,860 --> 01:12:30,887
Okay. Let me just assure you fellas,

1424
01:12:30,962 --> 01:12:34,353
David Ershon is an upstanding citizen.

1425
01:12:34,398 --> 01:12:36,361
I am playing squash with him tonight at the club,

1426
01:12:36,364 --> 01:12:37,364
and we're having dinner.

1427
01:12:37,435 --> 01:12:39,528
You listen to me, you Windsor knot-wearing monkey,

1428
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:41,696
you play squash with Ershon, right?

1429
01:12:41,806 --> 01:12:43,488
Your kids go to school with his? 

1430
01:12:43,489 --> 01:12:45,038
How would you know if he's clean or not?

1431
01:12:45,143 --> 01:12:46,804
I will take a look at your evidence,

1432
01:12:46,878 --> 01:12:48,706
and I will take a second look at the financials.

1433
01:12:48,813 --> 01:12:50,872
And when I come back and bust your ass,

1434
01:12:50,982 --> 01:12:53,773
we're locking David Ershon in the Federal Reserve!

1435
01:12:53,774 --> 01:12:55,378
He still doesn't understand the concept.

1436
01:13:16,441 --> 01:13:17,965
What are you doing?

1437
01:13:18,509 --> 01:13:20,389
We just handed all of our evidence over 

1438
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:21,809
to the bad guy's lawyer!

1439
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,143
Are you a big man, huh?

1440
01:13:24,215 --> 01:13:25,682
I'm talking to you.        What?

1441
01:13:25,850 --> 01:13:27,130
You wake up in the morning, you say, 

1442
01:13:27,131 --> 01:13:28,615
"I'm putting on my big boy pants"?

1443
01:13:28,686 --> 01:13:29,914
"Look, I'm wearing a belt!

1444
01:13:30,021 --> 01:13:32,148
"I've got big boy pants on!"        No!

1445
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:34,153
You borrow a little jacket, you go?

1446
01:13:34,358 --> 01:13:36,417
You take your lunch 'cause you got big boy pants on?

1447
01:13:36,928 --> 01:13:38,759
You got your big boy pants and your snack?

1448
01:13:39,530 --> 01:13:41,157
I could say big, loud things!

1449
01:13:41,666 --> 01:13:43,065
I could be demonstrative!

1450
01:13:43,401 --> 01:13:45,745
Stop!        We don't, we don't do this!

1451
01:13:45,746 --> 01:13:47,496
You're scaring the shit out of me, man! Stop it!

1452
01:13:47,605 --> 01:13:50,802
Is this how you conduct yourself? In a democracy?

1453
01:13:50,908 --> 01:13:52,569
What the hell are you doing, man?

1454
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:57,413
I'm so tired of you getting angry and yelling all the time.

1455
01:13:58,316 --> 01:13:59,977
It's exhausting.

1456
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:03,985
I feel like I'm partners with the Hulk.

1457
01:14:04,422 --> 01:14:06,913
You wanna know why I'm so angry all the time?

1458
01:14:06,991 --> 01:14:10,358
'Cause the more I try and do right, the more I screw things up.

1459
01:14:11,095 --> 01:14:16,123
We've got a possible jumper at 3 World Financial Center, 23rd floor.

1460
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,564
All units, fire department, en route.

1461
01:14:18,586 --> 01:14:20,923
SEC.        Beaman's office.

1462
01:14:21,239 --> 01:14:22,597
We have to go.

1463
01:14:22,598 --> 01:14:24,590
But the Captain.        We have to go, Allen.

1464
01:14:24,592 --> 01:14:26,359
All units, I need a respondent. 

1465
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,042
Possible jumper, 3 World Financial Center.

1466
01:14:40,191 --> 01:14:42,386
Shit. It's Beaman!

1467
01:14:43,194 --> 01:14:46,027
He's gotta know something.        Wesley!

1468
01:14:46,297 --> 01:14:48,128
Detective Hoitz and Gamble. We got this.

1469
01:14:48,566 --> 01:14:51,359
I took an online class at University of Phoenix on negotiating.

1470
01:14:51,365 --> 01:14:53,396
I'm gonna need a priest and a bullhorn.

1471
01:14:53,504 --> 01:14:55,870
I got no bullhorn.        Does anyone have a bullhorn?

1472
01:14:55,973 --> 01:14:58,168
Bullhorn, anyone?        Truck.

1473
01:14:59,210 --> 01:15:01,201
Police business. I need to use your PA system.

1474
01:15:01,312 --> 01:15:02,540
Okay, let me turn it on.

1475
01:15:04,482 --> 01:15:07,315
Mr. Beaman? Mr. Don Beaman?

1476
01:15:07,385 --> 01:15:10,582
It's Wesley. I know Ershon's Wesley's...

1477
01:15:10,688 --> 01:15:13,521
Look, there's a lot to live for in this life.

1478
01:15:13,591 --> 01:15:18,654
A lot of great things, like soda pop, big fresh can of soda pop.

1479
01:15:18,729 --> 01:15:20,094
They do not care!

1480
01:15:20,198 --> 01:15:22,496
Give me this. I know how to talk to him.

1481
01:15:22,567 --> 01:15:26,530
Listen, we all know you're a scumbag, and nobody cares about you.

1482
01:15:26,537 --> 01:15:28,068
Rotten piece of shit.

1483
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:29,706
That's worse than what I was saying.

1484
01:15:30,107 --> 01:15:31,699
I'm not gonna lie to you, Don.

1485
01:15:31,776 --> 01:15:34,146
People down here are starting to murmur 

1486
01:15:34,147 --> 01:15:36,143
that you don't have the balls to do it.

1487
01:15:36,143 --> 01:15:37,938
I don't care!        Yeah.

1488
01:15:38,049 --> 01:15:40,381
I say you can do it.

1489
01:15:41,118 --> 01:15:43,774
I mean, I don't want you to jump. 

1490
01:15:43,775 --> 01:15:45,935
I'm just saying you have the capability.

1491
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:46,781
Look, he's flying!

1492
01:15:52,530 --> 01:15:53,758
Stop that.

1493
01:15:54,532 --> 01:15:56,697
Half empty bottle of gin. Chair knocked over.

1494
01:15:56,698 --> 01:15:58,591
Look at this, it's a clear sign of a struggle.

1495
01:15:58,640 --> 01:15:59,930
 Make sure you get this, all right?

1496
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:03,205
Detectives, all your work's done here. You can go.

1497
01:16:03,274 --> 01:16:04,916
What about Ershon targeting the lottery?

1498
01:16:04,942 --> 01:16:06,933
You know why Ershon was calling down 

1499
01:16:06,934 --> 01:16:09,107
to the lottery offices all those times?

1500
01:16:09,213 --> 01:16:11,204
Because he was hooking up with the Powerball girl,

1501
01:16:11,282 --> 01:16:13,580
the one on TV with all the numbered balls.

1502
01:16:13,684 --> 01:16:16,275
Yeah. She filed a restraining order on him last week.

1503
01:16:16,354 --> 01:16:18,185
It was right there in front of you the whole time.

1504
01:16:18,256 --> 01:16:20,224
Can't be.        You guys are getting transferred.

1505
01:16:20,291 --> 01:16:22,418
What?        Traffic.

1506
01:16:22,526 --> 01:16:23,788
Yeah, that's right.

1507
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:26,128
You, you're gonna walk a beat downtown. 

1508
01:16:26,129 --> 01:16:27,392
You're gonna walk a beat downtown.

1509
01:16:27,465 --> 01:16:29,057
It's done. No.        Captain, what are you talking about?

1510
01:16:29,058 --> 01:16:29,872
No, no. It's done.

1511
01:16:29,901 --> 01:16:31,966
Save yourselves some gas.        Captain!

1512
01:16:32,303 --> 01:16:33,702
Is there an appeal process we can...

1513
01:16:33,771 --> 01:16:36,934
Had to do what you had to do, Captain.

1514
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:39,236
Wow! That hurt.

1515
01:16:41,379 --> 01:16:43,540
Excuse me. Where's my car?        They towed it.

1516
01:16:43,614 --> 01:16:46,082
Couple of homeless people were messing around in it.

1517
01:16:46,150 --> 01:16:49,813
That's an official police car.        Could have fooled me.

1518
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:56,256
Wow, Mauch was upset, huh?

1519
01:16:56,794 --> 01:16:57,954
Really?

1520
01:16:58,062 --> 01:16:59,817
The only thing I had to be proud of in my life

1521
01:16:59,818 --> 01:17:00,709
 was being a detective.

1522
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:03,058
That was all I had. Now it's gone.

1523
01:17:03,801 --> 01:17:06,292
I know. I know. You still got me.

1524
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:09,931
Don't you get it? I don't want you, Allen, okay? I never did.

1525
01:17:10,007 --> 01:17:12,237
I told you that scaffolding violation was dogshit.

1526
01:17:12,576 --> 01:17:14,795
I can't believe you still doubt me after everything we've seen.

1527
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:17,453
It's a real case, and I'm a real cop. 

1528
01:17:17,454 --> 01:17:19,316
We just got the wrong target for Ershon.

1529
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:22,047
You carry a rape whistle.        This is real cop work.

1530
01:17:22,048 --> 01:17:24,585
There is nothing about you that makes a man a man, okay?

1531
01:17:24,655 --> 01:17:28,391
You got no gun, no car, no wife, and now you got no partner.

1532
01:17:28,392 --> 01:17:29,751
Leave me alone.

1533
01:17:30,361 --> 01:17:31,851
A mutt case.

1534
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:34,488
Terry, I am a cop, for your information, okay?

1535
01:17:34,598 --> 01:17:36,759
A broken partnership.

1536
01:17:36,834 --> 01:17:37,960
I'm a cop!

1537
01:17:38,035 --> 01:17:41,698
And getting busted down to a shitty assignment.

1538
01:17:41,806 --> 01:17:44,866
Allen and Terry hit the trifecta.

1539
01:17:47,645 --> 01:17:50,705
But sometimes when you get your ass kicked,

1540
01:17:51,949 --> 01:17:54,645
that's when you find out what's real...

1541
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:59,013
...and what needs doing.

1542
01:18:04,962 --> 01:18:07,021
Whether it's directing traffic...

1543
01:18:07,131 --> 01:18:08,155
Come on!

1544
01:18:08,632 --> 01:18:12,068
...or cracking a multibillion dollar fraud.

1545
01:18:23,547 --> 01:18:25,740
Do you work here?        Yeah, I do.

1546
01:18:25,746 --> 01:18:28,549
The wrecking ball that crashed into Castien down there.

1547
01:18:28,652 --> 01:18:30,310
They also did damage to your office?

1548
01:18:30,321 --> 01:18:32,846
Some police officers came by and sealed it off.

1549
01:18:32,923 --> 01:18:34,254
Do you recall what they looked like?

1550
01:18:34,358 --> 01:18:37,054
One of them had an Australian accent.

1551
01:18:37,595 --> 01:18:41,395
You don't happen to do any business for the state lottery, do you?

1552
01:18:41,499 --> 01:18:44,866
No. Our main client is Lendl Global.

1553
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:46,562
Can I ask what this is about?

1554
01:18:46,940 --> 01:18:49,140
TRAFFIC ENFORCER OF THE MONTH

1555
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:53,140
Terry Hoitz

1556
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:02,487
Gator needs his gat, you punkass bitch!

1557
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:13,722
'Cause that's what a real cop is.

1558
01:19:13,798 --> 01:19:16,489
No, I didn't say "Lock her up. " I never said, "Lock her up. "

1559
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:19,198
A guy who does what needs to be done.

1560
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:23,229
A guy who knows how to use his dark side for good.

1561
01:19:23,307 --> 01:19:24,934
And then you move to Florida.

1562
01:19:34,251 --> 01:19:35,377
One, two, three, attack!

1563
01:19:38,089 --> 01:19:39,283
Terry, it's me.

1564
01:19:39,390 --> 01:19:41,620
Tap out. Tap out.        It's me, Allen.

1565
01:19:41,725 --> 01:19:43,283
Are you tapping out, or are you hitting me in the face?

1566
01:19:43,394 --> 01:19:45,055
I'm tapping out!

1567
01:19:45,930 --> 01:19:48,956
You crazy? What are you doing, man?

1568
01:19:49,066 --> 01:19:50,499
They might be watching us.        Could've killed you.

1569
01:19:50,601 --> 01:19:52,097
Turn out the lights.        What?

1570
01:19:52,102 --> 01:19:52,994
They could be watching us.        Who?

1571
01:19:53,237 --> 01:19:55,762
I found some big information, okay?

1572
01:19:55,840 --> 01:19:58,968
About what?        Some scary shit, Terry. This is big.

1573
01:19:59,276 --> 01:20:02,074
How'd you get in here? This place is foolproof.

1574
01:20:02,146 --> 01:20:04,614
We can't be too careful.        What are you talking about?

1575
01:20:04,682 --> 01:20:07,845
This place might be bugged.        There's no bugs in here.

1576
01:20:12,123 --> 01:20:15,115
First off, I missed you.

1577
01:20:15,192 --> 01:20:17,990
What's going on?        Did you hear what I said?

1578
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:22,088
Fine, I kind of missed you, too.        Thank you.

1579
01:20:22,166 --> 01:20:26,466
Okay. I found out whose losses Ershon has to cover.

1580
01:20:26,537 --> 01:20:28,835
It's Lendl Global.        What?

1581
01:20:28,939 --> 01:20:31,464
Lendl staged the Castien robbery as a distraction

1582
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:34,534
so they could break into their own accounting firm next door.

1583
01:20:34,645 --> 01:20:37,842
They then altered all the records to cover the losses

1584
01:20:37,948 --> 01:20:40,712
that Ershon had cost them through all of his bad investments.

1585
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:42,559
You're not supposed to be doing this. 

1586
01:20:43,145 --> 01:20:44,658
You're supposed to be walking the beat.

1587
01:20:44,693 --> 01:20:47,249
I know. Pretty tricky, though, huh?

1588
01:20:47,458 --> 01:20:49,483
This is bad, Allen. This is bad.

1589
01:20:49,560 --> 01:20:52,028
No wonder the captain wanted us to stay out of this.

1590
01:20:52,129 --> 01:20:54,522
Yeah, I bet Beaman started asking questions.

1591
01:20:54,531 --> 01:20:56,299
That's why they killed him.        Man.

1592
01:20:56,367 --> 01:20:57,527
Here's the other thing.

1593
01:20:57,635 --> 01:20:59,626
Tomorrow, there's a massive business deal going down.

1594
01:20:59,837 --> 01:21:01,202
Ershon's leading it.

1595
01:21:01,305 --> 01:21:02,511
I still can't figure out 

1596
01:21:02,512 --> 01:21:04,173
who the poor sucker is they're making the deal with,

1597
01:21:04,241 --> 01:21:05,401
but we gotta stop it.

1598
01:21:05,509 --> 01:21:07,170
It's time to let the peacock fly.

1599
01:21:08,212 --> 01:21:10,077
I'm not going, Allen. I like what I do.

1600
01:21:10,514 --> 01:21:12,641
So do I. We're cops.

1601
01:21:12,716 --> 01:21:17,594
No. I like what I do now. I like working traffic. It's a great gig.

1602
01:21:17,595 --> 01:21:18,378
What?

1603
01:21:18,989 --> 01:21:22,805
I like working traffic. I'm not going with you.

1604
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:25,351
What is this traffic bullshit?

1605
01:21:29,166 --> 01:21:32,693
What are you talking about?        I'm talking about my life.

1606
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:35,920
The corner I run on 54th and 3rd Avenue? It hums.

1607
01:21:35,921 --> 01:21:39,410
It's Terry's intersection. And the traffic guys? They're good guys.

1608
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:42,402
There's this one guy, Phillip? He can pee in the urinal from 20 feet.

1609
01:21:42,513 --> 01:21:44,073
You've gotta see it, Allen. You've got to.

1610
01:21:44,074 --> 01:21:46,685
What happened to you? What happened to this being our time?

1611
01:21:46,686 --> 01:21:48,845
No way, Allen. I'm out. I'm done.

1612
01:21:50,087 --> 01:21:52,954
Get in the car.        Come on, Allen. We both know it's wooden.

1613
01:21:54,525 --> 01:21:58,359
Apartment pop. Now get in the car.        You're not gonna shoot me.

1614
01:21:58,429 --> 01:22:01,284
Okay, I'll be honest. This is only the second time I've ever fired this.

1615
01:22:01,288 --> 01:22:02,492
So stop pointing it at me.

1616
01:22:02,516 --> 01:22:06,927
Look, tomorrow morning, all I know is I'm going to Mauch, all right?

1617
01:22:06,928 --> 01:22:07,980
For what? He doesn't care.

1618
01:22:08,038 --> 01:22:11,201
He's been dodging this case for too long and I want answers.

1619
01:22:11,275 --> 01:22:13,539
I want him to look me in the eye and tell me why.

1620
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:16,409
Turn on the news, man. Nobody cares.

1621
01:22:17,081 --> 01:22:18,446
I hope I'm not alone.

1622
01:22:19,250 --> 01:22:21,775
Hope you bring it.

1623
01:22:23,487 --> 01:22:25,614
We got a big day out there. Big one.

1624
01:22:25,723 --> 01:22:28,614
We got a full moon. People are gonna be amped, all right?

1625
01:22:28,642 --> 01:22:31,083
Let's see what we got on hot tips, all right?

1626
01:22:32,630 --> 01:22:34,122
The new bathmats are in.

1627
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:40,765
One more thing. We got a serial rapist in Crown Heights.

1628
01:22:40,838 --> 01:22:44,330
Jeez, I'm sorry. That's from my other job. Ignore that. Forget that.

1629
01:22:44,441 --> 01:22:45,601
Well, don't ignore it.

1630
01:22:45,676 --> 01:22:48,907
If you live in Crown Heights, you know, walk in pairs.

1631
01:22:48,979 --> 01:22:51,262
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories.

1632
01:22:51,263 --> 01:22:53,314
Gene Mauch to kitchen accessories. 

1633
01:22:53,417 --> 01:22:57,012
I gotta go. Go get 'em. Let's be careful out there.

1634
01:22:59,089 --> 01:23:00,249
The oak.

1635
01:23:00,324 --> 01:23:04,271
I like to keep the oak together and the maple separately, okay?

1636
01:23:04,272 --> 01:23:05,519
And these chopping boards?

1637
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:06,354
Hey, Captain.

1638
01:23:07,798 --> 01:23:10,323
Hey, Allen. Hey, how you doing?

1639
01:23:10,434 --> 01:23:12,347
What are you doing here? Are you here for the bathmats?

1640
01:23:12,703 --> 01:23:16,366
I need you to be straight with me.        Straight with us.

1641
01:23:16,473 --> 01:23:19,169
Hey, Terry. Look at this.

1642
01:23:19,276 --> 01:23:22,939
I thought you were working traffic today.        Let them block the box.

1643
01:23:23,347 --> 01:23:26,805
Besides, partners' code, right?        Thanks.

1644
01:23:28,352 --> 01:23:31,046
Hey, why have you worked your ass off trying to kill this case?

1645
01:23:32,389 --> 01:23:35,483
All right, fine. I'm gonna tell you guys something.

1646
01:23:35,559 --> 01:23:38,858
You really went into deep water on this one. You really went in deep.

1647
01:23:38,962 --> 01:23:40,896
Ershon's connected to all the higher ups,

1648
01:23:40,998 --> 01:23:44,285
and I gotta save what little ass I have left, okay?

1649
01:23:44,501 --> 01:23:46,662
You keep hiding from shit in the world,

1650
01:23:46,737 --> 01:23:49,351
and eventually the world comes to your front door.

1651
01:23:49,473 --> 01:23:51,803
Nice.        That's very nice.

1652
01:23:51,809 --> 01:23:53,867
I heard it in an episode of Touched By An Angel.

1653
01:23:53,911 --> 01:23:55,563
You keep this thing real quiet, 

1654
01:23:55,645 --> 01:23:57,905
and you make sure you have real evidence,

1655
01:23:58,015 --> 01:23:59,873
and maybe I'll see what I can do.

1656
01:23:59,883 --> 01:24:00,877
But if you make a lot of noise

1657
01:24:00,984 --> 01:24:04,147
and you attract the media attention, and you bring the DA in on this,

1658
01:24:04,221 --> 01:24:06,045
I am out, okay?

1659
01:24:06,089 --> 01:24:07,186
Yeah, we'll go in there like church mice.

1660
01:24:07,257 --> 01:24:10,923
But there's one case, one case in a career 

1661
01:24:10,924 --> 01:24:12,950
where you go all in. This is it.

1662
01:24:13,430 --> 01:24:16,763
All right. Then you do us proud.

1663
01:24:17,267 --> 01:24:18,714
'Cause I don't want no scrubs.

1664
01:24:19,269 --> 01:24:21,829
Really?        No.

1665
01:24:21,905 --> 01:24:23,997
You're not aware that's a TLC song?

1666
01:24:24,140 --> 01:24:25,583
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1667
01:24:25,618 --> 01:24:26,908
Second time.        You said chasing waterfalls,

1668
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:28,170
now you're saying you don't want no scrubs.

1669
01:24:28,245 --> 01:24:30,042
I don't even understand the reference.        It's like a tic.

1670
01:24:30,114 --> 01:24:31,240
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1671
01:24:31,348 --> 01:24:34,012
Remember, this thing gets messy, we never talked.

1672
01:24:34,051 --> 01:24:35,746
You can trust us.        Real quiet.

1673
01:24:35,853 --> 01:24:38,317
You gotta creep. Creep.

1674
01:24:38,389 --> 01:24:39,686
Come on.

1675
01:24:40,624 --> 01:24:41,955
You don't say "Creep-creep" 

1676
01:24:41,956 --> 01:24:43,595
unless you're quoting TLC.

1677
01:24:43,596 --> 01:24:44,759
Hey, guys.

1678
01:24:45,729 --> 01:24:47,894
You know Danson and Highsmith were not good cops, right?

1679
01:24:48,265 --> 01:24:50,062
Yeah, I guess we kind of knew that, but it's a drag.

1680
01:24:50,134 --> 01:24:52,034
I mean, at a certain point, who's left to be a hero?

1681
01:24:52,369 --> 01:24:55,832
Not to be corny, maybe it's you guys.

1682
01:24:56,974 --> 01:24:58,532
You ready?

1683
01:24:58,609 --> 01:25:00,270
Yeah.        Let's go.

1684
01:25:08,786 --> 01:25:11,152
No, but the highlights are great.        Thank you.

1685
01:25:11,255 --> 01:25:13,414
Sexy but serious.        Thank you.

1686
01:25:13,424 --> 01:25:14,789
Excuse me.

1687
01:25:15,793 --> 01:25:18,455
Who the hell are all these people? I was only expecting one man.

1688
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:23,056
You know, they're just some people I owe money to who wanted to be here.

1689
01:25:23,643 --> 01:25:24,625
Who are they?

1690
01:25:25,736 --> 01:25:30,435
Well, they are some Chechen patriots, entrepreneurs.

1691
01:25:30,507 --> 01:25:36,343
And the black chaps are some businessmen from Nigeria.

1692
01:25:36,447 --> 01:25:39,182
You owe money to the Nigerians and Chechens?

1693
01:25:39,183 --> 01:25:40,459
Yes. Yes, I do.

1694
01:25:40,467 --> 01:25:43,480
You're a piece of work.        Thank you.

1695
01:25:43,654 --> 01:25:47,021
Probably best to get started.

1696
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:50,916
This is good, baby. We're in the game, we know the score.

1697
01:25:50,994 --> 01:25:52,218
The only thing that bugs me is

1698
01:25:52,219 --> 01:25:53,930
 we still don't know who Ershon's targeting.

1699
01:25:53,997 --> 01:25:56,312
Is it the lotto? Who is it?

1700
01:25:56,313 --> 01:25:58,494
Who cares? Some rich prick.

1701
01:25:58,494 --> 01:26:04,229
I have to tell you, I am tremendously excited by this deal.

1702
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:06,776
And I can assure you that every dime of your money

1703
01:26:06,777 --> 01:26:10,043
will be invested with the utmost diligence.

1704
01:26:10,044 --> 01:26:11,848
Your rates of return are really exciting.

1705
01:26:11,949 --> 01:26:13,473
We think our members are gonna be just thrilled.

1706
01:26:13,550 --> 01:26:18,084
Yeah. I mean, we've averaged, like, 18% over the last 10 years.

1707
01:26:18,489 --> 01:26:20,684
All right. Quiet as a church mouse, in and out.

1708
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:23,125
I can feel that tingling in my balls you were talking about.

1709
01:26:23,126 --> 01:26:24,184
Beautiful.

1710
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:25,693
All right, listen up.

1711
01:26:25,796 --> 01:26:28,697
I am Detective Gamble. This is Detective Hoitz.

1712
01:26:28,799 --> 01:26:30,960
We need your cooperation.

1713
01:26:31,034 --> 01:26:32,501
David Ershon.

1714
01:26:32,569 --> 01:26:34,901
You're under arrest for fraud, embezzlement,

1715
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:37,100
and in connection to the murder of Don Beaman.

1716
01:26:37,207 --> 01:26:38,640
This is a bad idea.

1717
01:26:39,142 --> 01:26:40,507
Hey, guys.

1718
01:26:42,079 --> 01:26:44,547
Bob? What are you doing here?

1719
01:26:45,015 --> 01:26:46,346
I'm investing.

1720
01:26:46,416 --> 01:26:49,150
Do you remember we talked about that proxy vote a while back?

1721
01:26:49,151 --> 01:26:50,896
This is what it was for.        Holy shit.

1722
01:26:50,897 --> 01:26:53,379
It's a more aggressive investment strategy for the pension.

1723
01:26:53,380 --> 01:26:57,489
Allen! We're the suckers. They're targeting the police pension fund.

1724
01:27:03,834 --> 01:27:07,933
Gentlemen, you're here illegally and without a warrant.

1725
01:27:08,372 --> 01:27:10,439
We are within our rights to take action.

1726
01:28:08,231 --> 01:28:10,248
So much for quiet as church mice!

1727
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:11,693
Go!

1728
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,205
Who the hell are those guys?

1729
01:28:18,275 --> 01:28:18,822
Gentlemen, 

1730
01:28:18,823 --> 01:28:21,336
I can get you obstructed view tickets for Rock of Ages.

1731
01:28:21,411 --> 01:28:23,221
Even I admit that's not very tempting, 

1732
01:28:23,222 --> 01:28:25,371
but I'm not made of tickets, God damn it!

1733
01:28:25,449 --> 01:28:27,683
Get in the front!        How do you start this freaking thing?

1734
01:28:27,684 --> 01:28:28,673
Go on! Go!

1735
01:28:29,419 --> 01:28:30,768
Shit!        Go!

1736
01:28:32,889 --> 01:28:33,878
Oh, my...

1737
01:28:35,292 --> 01:28:38,639
Jeanie! Get over here! You, go get the bloody car!

1738
01:29:24,741 --> 01:29:25,730
Hold the wheel!

1739
01:29:31,448 --> 01:29:33,814
Open the back!        I got it. I got it!

1740
01:29:41,825 --> 01:29:44,760
They're gonna kill me. And then they will kill you.

1741
01:29:44,861 --> 01:29:47,261
Well, I'm gonna kill you first!        And then they will kill me.

1742
01:29:47,364 --> 01:29:50,390
We have two rogue police officers. They are armed and dangerous,

1743
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,161
and holding David Ershon hostage.        Stupid pricks!

1744
01:29:52,235 --> 01:29:55,807
It's us, we're good guys!        Exactly. They're the good guys.

1745
01:29:55,808 --> 01:29:58,000
Where do we go? Where do we go?

1746
01:29:58,075 --> 01:30:00,737
I have a small apartment. No one knows about it.

1747
01:30:00,844 --> 01:30:03,540
I use it mainly for my parents and prostitutes.

1748
01:30:03,613 --> 01:30:06,036
Not at the same time. That would be wrong.

1749
01:30:08,952 --> 01:30:11,648
Let's hear it from the top, every detail.

1750
01:30:12,222 --> 01:30:14,094
I think the best way to tell the story is 

1751
01:30:14,440 --> 01:30:17,113
by starting at the end, briefly,

1752
01:30:17,114 --> 01:30:19,354
then going back to the beginning, 

1753
01:30:19,842 --> 01:30:22,149
and then periodically returning to the end,

1754
01:30:22,184 --> 01:30:25,092
maybe giving different characters' perspectives throughout.

1755
01:30:25,202 --> 01:30:27,006
Just to give it a bit of dynamism, 

1756
01:30:27,007 --> 01:30:28,571
otherwise, it's just sort of a linear story.

1757
01:30:28,572 --> 01:30:29,732
Just tell us what happened.

1758
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:31,742
I lost a bunch of money from some people 

1759
01:30:31,743 --> 01:30:33,018
and now they want it back.

1760
01:30:33,053 --> 01:30:34,206
What about Don Beaman?

1761
01:30:34,277 --> 01:30:36,868
Beaman knew that I had falsified my financials,

1762
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:39,578
so they sent down Wesley to try and keep him quiet.

1763
01:30:39,883 --> 01:30:41,938
He forced him at gunpoint to drink a bunch of gin

1764
01:30:41,939 --> 01:30:44,077
and then forced him onto the ledge.

1765
01:30:44,078 --> 01:30:45,683
It was only a matter of time before he fell.

1766
01:30:45,756 --> 01:30:49,192
At least we stopped you from getting the pension fund.

1767
01:30:49,259 --> 01:30:52,574
Well, but, yeah, but you didn't. It's already in my account.

1768
01:30:52,596 --> 01:30:55,790
By 9:00 in the morning, it goes into the Lendl equity fund

1769
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:58,061
and from there it's transferred to a dozen offshore accounts.

1770
01:30:58,068 --> 01:30:59,592
By 9:01, it's gone.

1771
01:30:59,703 --> 01:31:02,695
Well, what if we stop the transfer?        But you can't.

1772
01:31:02,773 --> 01:31:05,241
What if we stop the transfer?

1773
01:31:05,308 --> 01:31:08,669
You'd have to be at Endemic Bank for 9:00 exactly,

1774
01:31:08,670 --> 01:31:10,836
find the clerk, get the routing number.

1775
01:31:10,837 --> 01:31:11,872
We gotta stop it.

1776
01:31:11,948 --> 01:31:13,142
There's no way.

1777
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:15,645
Every cop, the crazy Australian and his crew, 

1778
01:31:15,780 --> 01:31:16,871
they'll all be after us.

1779
01:31:16,953 --> 01:31:21,199
You could let me go, and I'll give you $10 million each.

1780
01:31:21,658 --> 01:31:24,718
It's not a bribe.        Of course it's a bribe.

1781
01:31:24,795 --> 01:31:27,222
You're offering to pay us money to not do our job.

1782
01:31:28,999 --> 01:31:30,261
It's not a bribe.

1783
01:31:30,901 --> 01:31:33,301
We hang low here tonight. Nobody knows about this place.

1784
01:31:33,403 --> 01:31:35,442
We'll be safe. And tomorrow, we hit it.

1785
01:31:35,906 --> 01:31:37,600
First things first, I gotta go see Sheila.

1786
01:31:37,651 --> 01:31:38,906
No way, it's too dangerous.

1787
01:31:39,009 --> 01:31:41,307
Look, Terry, we don't know what's gonna happen to us tomorrow,

1788
01:31:41,411 --> 01:31:44,938
but tonight, I need to make things right with Sheila.

1789
01:31:45,448 --> 01:31:47,748
All right, go. Go. Be careful.

1790
01:31:47,818 --> 01:31:49,445
Thanks, I will.

1791
01:31:50,287 --> 01:31:51,515
Will you say hi to Sheila for me?

1792
01:31:51,688 --> 01:31:53,451
Okay.        Okay.

1793
01:31:53,523 --> 01:31:56,492
Tell her. Say Terry was asking about you.

1794
01:31:56,593 --> 01:31:58,026
He wants to make sure you know

1795
01:31:58,128 --> 01:32:00,494
that he'll be there for you if anything happens.

1796
01:32:00,597 --> 01:32:02,656
Yeah.        Drop of a hat, I'm there.

1797
01:32:02,866 --> 01:32:04,857
Look, it's starting to get a little weird, man.

1798
01:32:04,968 --> 01:32:07,869
If something happens to you, I need to be there to take care of her.

1799
01:32:07,971 --> 01:32:11,012
All of her wants, her needs, and desires are now my responsibility.

1800
01:32:11,014 --> 01:32:13,135
Why do you say it like it's a predetermined thing?

1801
01:32:13,343 --> 01:32:14,708
Just go, man.

1802
01:32:15,445 --> 01:32:17,335
Okay. Thanks.

1803
01:32:17,881 --> 01:32:18,973
Go.

1804
01:32:22,953 --> 01:32:24,213
Janeco Gallery.

1805
01:32:25,055 --> 01:32:27,148
Francine, it's Terry. Please don't hang up.

1806
01:32:37,868 --> 01:32:39,028
Please pick up.

1807
01:32:39,903 --> 01:32:41,063
Hello.

1808
01:32:41,171 --> 01:32:44,334
Hey, sweetie. I was praying you'd be at your mom's house.

1809
01:32:44,407 --> 01:32:48,042
You know what, I can't talk anymore. I think the phone's being tapped.

1810
01:32:48,043 --> 01:32:50,502
Baby, where are you? I wanna see you.

1811
01:32:50,513 --> 01:32:53,174
I'm near the place where we did it three Halloweens ago.

1812
01:32:53,175 --> 01:32:54,107
Do you remember?

1813
01:32:54,751 --> 01:32:56,150
Okay, yeah, I got it.

1814
01:32:56,219 --> 01:32:57,436
I'm just warning you, though.

1815
01:32:57,940 --> 01:33:00,252
 Watch out. I think they're watching the house.

1816
01:33:00,287 --> 01:33:02,617
Don't worry, sweetie. I think I have a way of talking to you.

1817
01:33:03,059 --> 01:33:06,995
I have to admit, I wasn't gonna come. I mean...

1818
01:33:08,164 --> 01:33:11,600
After all those years, after the restraining order.

1819
01:33:11,701 --> 01:33:15,068
I was worried I might not see you again.

1820
01:33:15,171 --> 01:33:16,763
There's some very dangerous people after him,

1821
01:33:16,873 --> 01:33:18,297
and now they're after us.

1822
01:33:21,111 --> 01:33:22,510
It's just the old lady.

1823
01:33:28,084 --> 01:33:29,517
Hello, Allen.

1824
01:33:29,586 --> 01:33:32,180
Hello, Mama Ramos. What are you doing out here?

1825
01:33:32,255 --> 01:33:35,999
Sheila said she doesn't know what happened and she wants you back.

1826
01:33:36,693 --> 01:33:38,558
She also says...        Yes.

1827
01:33:38,628 --> 01:33:42,462
...she wants you on top of her, holding her hair,

1828
01:33:42,565 --> 01:33:44,990
and riding her like a bucking bronco

1829
01:33:45,235 --> 01:33:49,164
while she sucks your thumb and says, "Mommy likey. "

1830
01:33:49,706 --> 01:33:51,664
You, you tell your daughter...

1831
01:33:51,665 --> 01:33:54,075
He said he'll always love you.

1832
01:33:54,144 --> 01:33:56,806
And he's so happy that you're having his child.

1833
01:33:56,913 --> 01:33:58,073
Allen.

1834
01:33:58,148 --> 01:33:59,979
He also says that

1835
01:34:00,083 --> 01:34:02,846
he wants you to stare into each other's eyes 

1836
01:34:02,847 --> 01:34:04,851
without blinking while you do it.

1837
01:34:04,854 --> 01:34:07,374
I love when we do that, Mom.        And then afterward,

1838
01:34:07,657 --> 01:34:09,625
lick the sex off each other.

1839
01:34:11,194 --> 01:34:13,094
I don't wanna do this.

1840
01:34:14,497 --> 01:34:16,746
You say things that are too personal.

1841
01:34:16,747 --> 01:34:18,523
Okay, but just one more thing.

1842
01:34:18,524 --> 01:34:20,168
She said she loves you,

1843
01:34:20,236 --> 01:34:23,630
and wants to hold your hand and have iced tea with you.

1844
01:34:24,007 --> 01:34:26,852
Come on. That's not all she said.

1845
01:34:27,010 --> 01:34:28,204
No.

1846
01:34:29,279 --> 01:34:32,874
She says other things, but I don't want...        Please, please, please.

1847
01:34:32,949 --> 01:34:35,363
You don't realize, I may be killed tomorrow.

1848
01:34:35,685 --> 01:34:36,879
Okay.

1849
01:34:39,422 --> 01:34:44,591
She says she wants to unplug all the clocks and the phones

1850
01:34:44,592 --> 01:34:47,892
and have a three-day F marathon.        That's more like it. Yeah.

1851
01:34:47,897 --> 01:34:53,102
She wants to walk wrong for a week because you guys F'd so hard.

1852
01:34:53,103 --> 01:34:54,331
That's just lovely.

1853
01:34:54,738 --> 01:34:58,367
No more! He says things I can't say.

1854
01:34:58,441 --> 01:35:00,793
It involves a mannequin hand 

1855
01:35:00,794 --> 01:35:04,410
and an electric shaver taped to a golf club.

1856
01:35:12,756 --> 01:35:13,814
Now what'd she say?

1857
01:35:16,292 --> 01:35:18,055
She says she loves you.

1858
01:35:24,300 --> 01:35:26,632
I'm so sorry about everything.

1859
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:32,042
And I just had to come here tonight to tell you that I love you.

1860
01:35:32,440 --> 01:35:35,911
And the reason why I act like you're a plain wife is that

1861
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:41,641
I'm afraid that if I admit to how stunning

1862
01:35:41,751 --> 01:35:44,549
and intelligent and wonderful you are,

1863
01:35:45,422 --> 01:35:49,606
I'd just lose you.        Shut up, Allen. I love you.

1864
01:35:49,759 --> 01:35:52,557
We have a place that's safe. All right.

1865
01:36:05,108 --> 01:36:06,336
I'm gonna break your hip.

1866
01:36:15,118 --> 01:36:18,016
I'm about to do you grandpa-style.

1867
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:27,240


1868
01:36:32,836 --> 01:36:34,463
I brought some music.

1869
01:36:38,975 --> 01:36:40,966
Not what I would've chosen, but screw it.

1870
01:36:41,044 --> 01:36:44,309
All right. Let's go, Monday morning, time to go to work.

1871
01:36:44,380 --> 01:36:45,556
Let's do it.

1872
01:36:45,615 --> 01:36:47,344
You want my gate code?        Shut up, man!

1873
01:36:54,891 --> 01:36:55,983
That's Wesley!

1874
01:37:07,036 --> 01:37:08,128
Yes!

1875
01:37:10,540 --> 01:37:13,065
Where'd you learn to drive like that?        Grand Theft Auto!

1876
01:37:16,012 --> 01:37:17,290
Shit, Allen, they're coming.

1877
01:37:20,150 --> 01:37:22,710
Oh, my God!        Shit.

1878
01:37:23,987 --> 01:37:26,242
Do something, Allen!        Hold on, hold on.

1879
01:37:47,177 --> 01:37:49,074
Someone's been playing Grand Theft Auto.

1880
01:37:50,747 --> 01:37:52,078
I did that!

1881
01:37:52,182 --> 01:37:53,843
I did that!        Oh, my God!

1882
01:37:53,917 --> 01:37:56,265
That's what I'm talking about!        We jackknifed them!

1883
01:37:56,286 --> 01:37:58,777
Did you see that? It went backwards and then turned upside-down.

1884
01:37:58,888 --> 01:38:00,935
Gator turns vans upside-down 

1885
01:38:00,936 --> 01:38:02,650
like they're in a crazy washing machine!

1886
01:38:02,659 --> 01:38:05,243
Why are you calling yourself Gator?

1887
01:38:05,261 --> 01:38:07,825
It's a nickname I had in college. I used to run a dating service.

1888
01:38:07,897 --> 01:38:11,094
He was a pimp.        Yeah, I was. I was a pimp.

1889
01:38:11,234 --> 01:38:13,702
Is it me or does it smell like deer vagina in here?

1890
01:38:14,737 --> 01:38:15,863
My poor car.

1891
01:38:16,206 --> 01:38:18,674
Right now the streets are a bloodbath.

1892
01:38:18,775 --> 01:38:21,819
And, statistically speaking, there's about 30 kids in here,

1893
01:38:21,978 --> 01:38:24,269
10 of you are gonna be dead before your next birthday.

1894
01:38:24,280 --> 01:38:27,340
Got a couple of tips, help you guys stay out of jail.

1895
01:38:27,450 --> 01:38:31,042
One, try your hardest to not be black or Hispanic.

1896
01:38:31,043 --> 01:38:34,018
It's a good tip.        Yeah. Two...

1897
01:38:34,123 --> 01:38:35,520
Gentlemen, we got a hot one.

1898
01:38:35,521 --> 01:38:39,290
Hoitz and Gamble have Ershon hostage, high-speed car chase in progress.

1899
01:38:39,295 --> 01:38:41,283
Yes! Gun, gun!

1900
01:38:41,284 --> 01:38:43,298
Pass up the guns. Pass them up. Let's go, people.

1901
01:38:43,299 --> 01:38:44,926
There we go. Anything, any Tasers? No?

1902
01:38:45,001 --> 01:38:46,734
Good. Who wants to go on a ride-along?

1903
01:38:46,735 --> 01:38:47,969
I do!

1904
01:38:48,471 --> 01:38:49,836
All right, you, sweetie. Come on, let's go. Move.

1905
01:38:49,939 --> 01:38:51,633
Move! Let's go.        Come on!

1906
01:39:01,684 --> 01:39:04,928
Cool, a helicopter! Must be covering the high-speed chase.

1907
01:39:09,826 --> 01:39:11,191
Jesus!

1908
01:39:16,032 --> 01:39:19,030
Who are those guys?        They're Chechen investors.

1909
01:39:19,031 --> 01:39:21,961
We were gonna do a Chechen version of Dora the Explorer.

1910
01:39:22,038 --> 01:39:24,330
Anyway, it went terribly wrong.

1911
01:39:26,809 --> 01:39:29,304
I feel like it's not fair that they have a helicopter!

1912
01:39:30,013 --> 01:39:31,071
Oh, no.

1913
01:39:32,482 --> 01:39:33,540
Damn it.

1914
01:39:37,420 --> 01:39:40,188
Watch your head. God, your hair is soft.

1915
01:39:40,189 --> 01:39:41,822
VO5 Hot Oil.

1916
01:39:44,761 --> 01:39:47,299
You're gonna wreck! There's cars coming from both directions!

1917
01:39:47,300 --> 01:39:48,485
I'm not gonna wreck!

1918
01:39:50,233 --> 01:39:52,296
I'm gonna wreck! You're right!        You want me to drive?

1919
01:40:12,021 --> 01:40:14,683
This was a very clever idea.        Yeah.

1920
01:40:26,769 --> 01:40:28,066
They're gone.

1921
01:40:29,472 --> 01:40:30,564
Let's go.

1922
01:40:42,885 --> 01:40:46,481
They are Nigerians. Yeah, I'd forgotten about them.

1923
01:40:54,197 --> 01:40:55,815
This is a shortcut.        Are you kidding me?

1924
01:40:55,818 --> 01:40:57,126
You cannot go down there.

1925
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:06,130
What are you doing?

1926
01:41:12,348 --> 01:41:13,440
Hit him!

1927
01:41:21,157 --> 01:41:22,822
Where are we?        Chelsea Pier.

1928
01:41:28,998 --> 01:41:30,090
What the hell?

1929
01:41:31,434 --> 01:41:32,828
Jesus!

1930
01:41:39,876 --> 01:41:41,927
Them having a helicopter is definitely cheating.

1931
01:41:42,478 --> 01:41:43,536
Go!

1932
01:41:48,684 --> 01:41:49,776
Come on!

1933
01:41:51,654 --> 01:41:53,812
We're cops! Hit the chopper!

1934
01:42:16,145 --> 01:42:17,851
This is Martin and Fosse, en route. 

1935
01:42:17,852 --> 01:42:19,538
Back off! This is our collar!

1936
01:42:20,850 --> 01:42:23,702
Set up a perimeter. No arrests until we get there!

1937
01:42:23,820 --> 01:42:25,378
Take the light!

1938
01:42:45,074 --> 01:42:46,668
Do not authorize that transfer.

1939
01:42:46,709 --> 01:42:48,567
This is David Ershon. The transfer is for him.

1940
01:42:48,568 --> 01:42:50,847
He will tell you not to authorize it, okay? Tell him.

1941
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,798
Tell him!        Yeah, do as they say. Stop the transfer.

1942
01:42:53,803 --> 01:42:54,650
Approve it.

1943
01:42:56,118 --> 01:42:57,210
Now.

1944
01:42:57,286 --> 01:42:59,287
Do not touch anything!

1945
01:42:59,288 --> 01:43:01,552
I swear to God I'll blow your head all over this desk.

1946
01:43:01,624 --> 01:43:04,125
Not a person in this room believes you'll shoot this clerk.

1947
01:43:04,126 --> 01:43:05,218
Yeah?

1948
01:43:06,596 --> 01:43:10,088
Thank you so much, gentlemen, for the prompt delivery of Mr. Ershon.

1949
01:43:10,199 --> 01:43:13,600
I have two competing bids from jilted investors.

1950
01:43:14,303 --> 01:43:16,833
They're at 30 million, and holding.

1951
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:19,208
Wait! Can't you let me...        Take him away.

1952
01:43:19,775 --> 01:43:21,299
But computers.

1953
01:43:22,479 --> 01:43:26,880
What if, one day, they were in charge?

1954
01:43:28,451 --> 01:43:32,847
Now if you don't shut up, I will cut your ear off with a butter knife.

1955
01:43:32,848 --> 01:43:35,015
That's blunt. Blunt's worse than if it's sharp.

1956
01:43:35,016 --> 01:43:36,052
Now!

1957
01:43:43,099 --> 01:43:44,259
You just stood there!

1958
01:43:44,367 --> 01:43:47,231
I didn't know that "now" meant that. How am I supposed to know that?

1959
01:43:47,236 --> 01:43:49,101
I knew what that meant.        Shut up.

1960
01:43:49,205 --> 01:43:52,231
You kill us and you kill Ershon. You're out 30 million dollars.

1961
01:43:52,308 --> 01:43:54,401
Who's got the golden goose now, huh?        Yeah.

1962
01:43:58,447 --> 01:44:00,039
Shit!

1963
01:44:00,716 --> 01:44:03,267
He's still valuable with a bullet wound, mate.

1964
01:44:03,268 --> 01:44:04,817
He immediately called your bluff.

1965
01:44:04,921 --> 01:44:06,802
Get up. And kill the police.

1966
01:44:06,822 --> 01:44:08,549
I just wanna make sure I get it right.

1967
01:44:08,550 --> 01:44:11,842
Did you want this transfer approved or not approved?

1968
01:44:12,261 --> 01:44:14,627
You, mate, I'm gonna kill just for fun.

1969
01:44:16,165 --> 01:44:18,963
Police, don't move! Drop your weapons!

1970
01:44:19,068 --> 01:44:22,003
Drop it, or be dropped, homeboy!

1971
01:44:22,071 --> 01:44:25,366
I hope you like the taste of prison food and penis.

1972
01:44:25,407 --> 01:44:27,871
Police! Down on the ground!        Let me see your hands!

1973
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:38,051
Hey, hey, you okay?        Hey.

1974
01:44:38,955 --> 01:44:41,571
Hey, Gene. Captain. I'm sorry.

1975
01:44:41,624 --> 01:44:43,369
I'm sorry.        That's okay. Don't worry about it.

1976
01:44:43,392 --> 01:44:44,991
You can call me Gene when we're not in the office.

1977
01:44:45,361 --> 01:44:47,765
Okay. Thanks for coming by.

1978
01:44:47,813 --> 01:44:49,656
Attaboy.

1979
01:44:49,732 --> 01:44:52,132
Come on, stay with me. Stay with me.

1980
01:44:52,132 --> 01:44:54,978
We're losing him! We're losing him! He's dying!

1981
01:44:55,371 --> 01:44:57,843
No. No, no, no, no. I'm just resting. 

1982
01:44:57,844 --> 01:44:59,361
I'm just resting.

1983
01:44:59,396 --> 01:45:01,036
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?        I'm just resting.

1984
01:45:01,043 --> 01:45:02,567
Are you all right?        Just resting.

1985
01:45:02,678 --> 01:45:04,481
Hey, let me tell you something.

1986
01:45:04,481 --> 01:45:07,405
As far as paperwork goes, we'll take care of it.

1987
01:45:07,406 --> 01:45:08,908
You know why?        Why?

1988
01:45:09,018 --> 01:45:10,508
Ain't too proud to beg.

1989
01:45:11,153 --> 01:45:12,347
Come on.

1990
01:45:12,421 --> 01:45:14,593
What?        It's not funny anymore.

1991
01:45:14,593 --> 01:45:16,982
I don't know what you're talking about.        TLC references.

1992
01:45:16,993 --> 01:45:19,326
Still nothing. I swear to you.

1993
01:45:19,328 --> 01:45:21,185
I'm gonna go over and check on Terry. 

1994
01:45:21,940 --> 01:45:24,444
I got a bad knee. Hold on. There you go.

1995
01:45:24,734 --> 01:45:27,532
It was the king of the mutt cases,

1996
01:45:27,603 --> 01:45:31,030
but Allen and Terry had worked it like stars.

1997
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:36,837
Within 24 hours of learning about Ershon's scheme

1998
01:45:36,846 --> 01:45:38,968
and Lendl's massive losses,

1999
01:45:38,969 --> 01:45:42,128
the government issued TARP funds to bail out Lendl.

2000
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:44,759
Lendl is in everything, 

2001
01:45:44,760 --> 01:45:46,537
and we're gonna go everywhere...

2002
01:45:46,538 --> 01:45:47,990
They were too big to fail.

2003
01:45:48,290 --> 01:45:53,800
Ershon now resides in Palomino Federal Correctional Facility in Florida.

2004
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,622
He still invests. Currency's just different.

2005
01:45:57,700 --> 01:46:00,100
Roger Wesley was linked to the Beaman murder

2006
01:46:00,202 --> 01:46:04,002
by security cam footage which Martin and Fosse hadn't checked.

2007
01:46:04,073 --> 01:46:05,904
It only showed the back of their heads.

2008
01:46:06,008 --> 01:46:07,761
But Allen's Faceback app 

2009
01:46:07,762 --> 01:46:10,247
was able to get a match to their faces.

2010
01:46:10,579 --> 01:46:12,664
Terry married Francine.

2011
01:46:12,664 --> 01:46:15,517
He played harp at the reception and it was beautiful.

2012
01:46:15,584 --> 01:46:17,108
He had learned how to play it in the eighth grade

2013
01:46:17,219 --> 01:46:20,586
to make fun of the fairy that lived up the street.

2014
01:46:20,690 --> 01:46:24,536
Terry asked Sheila to be his best man, but she declined.

2015
01:46:24,536 --> 01:46:28,692
Let's be honest, we all wanna be superstars and hotshots.

2016
01:46:28,764 --> 01:46:29,992
But guess what?

2017
01:46:30,066 --> 01:46:33,791
The people that do the real work, the ones that make the difference,

2018
01:46:33,791 --> 01:46:36,828
you don't see them on TV or on the front page.

2019
01:46:37,473 --> 01:46:40,931
I'm talking about the day-in, day-outers, the grinders.

2020
01:46:41,077 --> 01:46:44,568
Come on, man, you know who I'm talking about: The other guys.

2021
01:46:44,568 --> 01:46:45,440
See? That's a no-go.        Hey, hey.

2022
01:46:46,215 --> 01:46:48,206
You think you broke this Ershon case open?

2023
01:46:48,617 --> 01:46:49,845
You did nothing.

2024
01:46:50,252 --> 01:46:52,042
Corporate lobbyists are spending millions

2025
01:46:52,042 --> 01:46:54,677
to make sure guys like Ershon keep doing what they do.

2026
01:46:55,057 --> 01:46:56,046
Derek Jeter?

2027
01:46:57,460 --> 01:47:01,143
Yeah, it's me. You were set up that night you shot me, Terry.

2028
01:47:01,143 --> 01:47:03,661
I told you!        They knew by putting someone like you

2029
01:47:03,733 --> 01:47:05,488
with a quick trigger finger next to that door 

2030
01:47:05,489 --> 01:47:06,703
where I do my pre-game walk,

2031
01:47:06,869 --> 01:47:09,708
it'd end up bad. Bad for both of us.

2032
01:47:09,772 --> 01:47:12,015
Now, I've been doing my own investigation on the banking industry,

2033
01:47:12,057 --> 01:47:14,066
and I was close. I was real close.

2034
01:47:14,477 --> 01:47:15,637
So I forgive you, Terry.

2035
01:47:16,212 --> 01:47:18,405
I appreciate that, man. I'm sorry about what happened.

2036
01:47:19,081 --> 01:47:20,543
I'm glad you're doing better.

2037
01:47:20,549 --> 01:47:22,987
The whole damn system is clogged up with dirty money.

2038
01:47:23,452 --> 01:47:26,773
And the news doesn't say a word about it. 'Cause who owns them?

2039
01:47:26,856 --> 01:47:29,603
The same corporations that own the government.

2040
01:47:29,892 --> 01:47:31,587
Courts and the law is all we have left.

2041
01:47:32,928 --> 01:47:34,471
So here's you guys' next case.

2042
01:47:35,498 --> 01:47:38,818
Guy by the name of Carl Bachand, CEO of Killister Bank.

2043
01:47:39,034 --> 01:47:41,321
He took three billion in TARP funds. 

2044
01:47:41,322 --> 01:47:43,392
He's crooked. He's real crooked.

2045
01:47:43,405 --> 01:47:48,401
Take him down, but be careful. He's got Blackwater mercenaries 24l7.

2046
01:47:49,044 --> 01:47:50,204
Thanks, Derek.

2047
01:47:51,514 --> 01:47:53,741
Hey, Derek! Wait! What if we need to get in touch with you,

2048
01:47:53,742 --> 01:47:56,082
get some more information or some tickets or something?

2049
01:47:56,819 --> 01:47:57,979
What just happened?

2050
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:00,740
POWEREDY BY 100% VEGETABLE OIL

2051
01:48:00,823 --> 01:48:03,917
Goldman Sachs. This case is gonna be nasty.

2052
01:48:06,595 --> 01:48:08,290
Hi. Cute glasses.

2053
01:48:09,298 --> 01:48:11,266
What was that?        What?

2054
01:48:11,333 --> 01:48:14,962
What? Dude, what is it with you and hot ladies? What's your secret?

2055
01:48:15,037 --> 01:48:17,699
Honestly, I have no idea what you're talking about.

2056
01:48:17,807 --> 01:48:19,832
Tell me who you lost your virginity to.

2057
01:48:19,942 --> 01:48:23,296
She actually became a TV actress. Heather Locklear.

2058
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:25,061
Heather Locklear, what?

2059
01:48:25,061 --> 01:48:26,441
You've heard of her?        Come on!

2060
01:48:26,515 --> 01:48:28,257
She was much chubbier back then.

2061
01:48:28,540 --> 01:48:31,140
 I don't get it. I really, I don't get it.

2062
01:48:31,640 --> 01:48:51,640
-==http://www.ragbear.com==-

2063
01:53:31,220 --> 01:53:32,881
That was you. You don't have a sense of humor.

2064
01:53:32,988 --> 01:53:35,169
I do... I have a wonderful sense of humor.

2065
01:53:35,169 --> 01:53:36,533
If you say something funny, I'll laugh.

2066
01:53:36,533 --> 01:53:38,181
All right, I'm gonna tell you a great joke.

2067
01:53:38,182 --> 01:53:39,622
Please. I love jokes.

2068
01:53:39,657 --> 01:53:42,238
All right. Little boy on his 13th birthday.

2069
01:53:43,398 --> 01:53:46,651
It's time to get laid.        Already feels inappropriate.

2070
01:53:46,835 --> 01:53:49,059
So he goes to the lady at the whorehouse, he goes, " Miss,

2071
01:53:49,059 --> 01:53:50,888
"look, I know usually you want money,

2072
01:53:50,889 --> 01:53:52,655
"but I don't have any money and it's my birthday.

2073
01:53:52,656 --> 01:53:54,552
"Do you think I could have sex with you for this duck?"

2074
01:53:54,776 --> 01:53:57,114
Was he a farmer?        No.

2075
01:53:57,179 --> 01:53:59,700
That's probably a Health Code violation, 

2076
01:53:59,701 --> 01:54:01,723
bringing a duck into a place of prostitution.

2077
01:54:01,723 --> 01:54:03,565
They weren't gonna have sex with the duck!

2078
01:54:03,752 --> 01:54:05,935
No, I just mean Health Code violation

2079
01:54:05,935 --> 01:54:09,308
to have the duck brought into a facility like that.

2080
01:54:10,692 --> 01:54:13,003
So, anyway, she says, "Yes, I'll do it. "

2081
01:54:13,395 --> 01:54:16,029
So he goes in there, gives it to her.

2082
01:54:16,398 --> 01:54:17,694
He gives her what?

2083
01:54:17,695 --> 01:54:19,812
The high, hard one! She loves it.

2084
01:54:19,835 --> 01:54:21,068
She goes, " You know what? 

2085
01:54:21,069 --> 01:54:23,328
"If you do that again, I'll give you your duck back. "

2086
01:54:23,328 --> 01:54:25,796
It's like getting laid twice for free.        So... I'm sorry.

2087
01:54:25,797 --> 01:54:26,635
I'm so sorry.

2088
01:54:26,848 --> 01:54:30,544
The duck is payment for sexual intercourse.        Yes. Yes.

2089
01:54:30,712 --> 01:54:31,872
Very good.        He used the duck as payment,

2090
01:54:31,947 --> 01:54:33,819
and now he's being paid back the duck.

2091
01:54:33,982 --> 01:54:36,438
He goes, " Oh, my God, this is the greatest birthday ever. " 

2092
01:54:36,439 --> 01:54:37,275
He does it again.

2093
01:54:37,386 --> 01:54:39,041
Now he's walking home, right? Walking...

2094
01:54:39,042 --> 01:54:41,284
So she was satisfied with duck.

2095
01:54:41,285 --> 01:54:43,447
With a duck as currency...        Yes.

2096
01:54:43,448 --> 01:54:45,993
...to her. Great. Good.

2097
01:54:46,128 --> 01:54:47,348
So he's walking home, 

2098
01:54:47,349 --> 01:54:50,164
now he can't wait to get home to tell his father. Right?

2099
01:54:50,342 --> 01:54:52,543
He's walking down the street with the duck, and all of a sudden, voom,

2100
01:54:52,567 --> 01:54:54,222
truck comes by and runs over his duck.

2101
01:54:54,222 --> 01:54:55,718
Kills the duck?        Killed the duck.

2102
01:54:55,718 --> 01:54:57,825
So the duck is now dead.        The duck is dead.

2103
01:54:58,073 --> 01:55:00,381
The kid starts crying, truck driver stops, 

2104
01:55:00,283 --> 01:55:02,190
he's all upset, he didn't mean...        Of course he's crying!

2105
01:55:02,191 --> 01:55:04,822
He's a 13-year-old boy who's just had sex, twice,

2106
01:55:04,846 --> 01:55:07,028
and he watched his beloved duck die.

2107
01:55:07,029 --> 01:55:08,455
Will you shut up and let me tell the story?

2108
01:55:08,483 --> 01:55:10,583
So far, I don't know how this is ever gonna be funny.

2109
01:55:10,686 --> 01:55:12,736
The guy feels so bad about killing the duck,

2110
01:55:12,737 --> 01:55:13,723
 he gives him two dollars.

2111
01:55:13,758 --> 01:55:15,203
And the kid's happy with the two bucks?

2112
01:55:15,357 --> 01:55:17,320
He's ecstatic! He got laid twice, 

2113
01:55:17,321 --> 01:55:19,124
and now he's got two dollars on top of it.

2114
01:55:19,159 --> 01:55:21,781
Seems like a duck would be worth a lot more than two dollars.

2115
01:55:22,531 --> 01:55:24,055
This was a while back. You what I'm...

2116
01:55:24,466 --> 01:55:26,957
So he goes home, his dad goes, "What happened? What happened?

2117
01:55:27,035 --> 01:55:28,108
"Tell me! Tell me!" 

2118
01:55:28,440 --> 01:55:30,968
He goes, "Dad, I got a fuck for the duck,

2119
01:55:31,003 --> 01:55:32,163
"I got a duck for the fuck,

2120
01:55:32,241 --> 01:55:34,784
"and I got two bucks for a fucked-up duck!"

2121
01:55:37,079 --> 01:55:38,307
So it's like a limerick.

2122
01:55:39,514 --> 01:55:40,742
You didn't think that was funny?

2123
01:55:41,216 --> 01:55:43,331
I thought it was entertaining at the end, sure,

2124
01:55:43,785 --> 01:55:45,620
the way all the words were put together,

2125
01:55:45,621 --> 01:55:47,329
but in terms of content?

2126
01:55:48,824 --> 01:55:49,916
No.

2127
01:55:53,128 --> 01:55:56,757
Get the check-check from Shen-Shen. Let's get out of here.

2128
01:56:01,970 --> 01:56:06,538
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

2129
01:56:06,642 --> 01:56:07,666
And cut.

2130
01:56:09,999 --> 01:56:10,010


2131
01:56:07,666 --> 01:56:07,666
