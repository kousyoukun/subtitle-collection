1
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,340
# Won't you come home,
Bill Bailey? #

2
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,619
# Won't you come home? #

3
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,299
# I moan the whole night long #

4
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:01,177
# I'll do the cooking, honey,
I'll pay the rent #

5
00:01:01,298 --> 00:01:03,617
# I know I done him wrong #

6
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,017
# Yes, you did #

7
00:01:05,137 --> 00:01:06,256
# Remember that rainy eve #

8
00:01:06,376 --> 00:01:07,696
# She threw me out #

9
00:01:07,816 --> 00:01:10,575
# With nothing but
a fine-tooth comb #

10
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,415
# But I know she's to blame #

11
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:14,373
# Yeah, ain't it a shame #

12
00:01:40,326 --> 00:01:42,325
# Oh, Bill Bailey,
won't you please #

13
00:01:42,445 --> 00:01:44,404
# Bill Bailey,
won't you please come #

14
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:47,804
# Bill Bailey,
won't you please come home? #

15
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:06,278
# When the red, red robin #

16
00:02:06,398 --> 00:02:08,677
# Comes bob,
bob, bobbin' along #

17
00:02:08,797 --> 00:02:09,997
# Along #

18
00:02:10,116 --> 00:02:11,436
# There'll be
no more sobbin' #

19
00:02:11,556 --> 00:02:12,996
# When he starts throbbin' #

20
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,595
# His own sweet song #

21
00:02:15,715 --> 00:02:16,554
# Wake up #

22
00:02:16,675 --> 00:02:18,474
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

23
00:02:18,595 --> 00:02:19,433
# Get up #

24
00:02:19,554 --> 00:02:20,993
# Get up, get out of bed #

25
00:02:21,113 --> 00:02:21,952
# Cheer up #

26
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,752
# Cheer up, the sun is red #

27
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,711
# Live, love #

28
00:02:24,832 --> 00:02:26,591
# Laugh and be happy #

29
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,150
# What if I've been blue #

30
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:31,869
# Now I'm walkin' through
fields of flowers #

31
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:32,989
# Rain may glisten #

32
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,109
# But still I listen #

33
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:37,148
# For hours and hours #

34
00:02:37,268 --> 00:02:38,467
# I'm just a kid again #

35
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:40,027
# Doin' what I did again #

36
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:42,306
# Singin' my song #

37
00:02:42,387 --> 00:02:43,706
# When the red, red robin #

38
00:02:43,827 --> 00:02:47,225
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

39
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:33,690
# When the red, red robin #

40
00:03:33,811 --> 00:03:36,009
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

41
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,449
# Along #

42
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,329
# There'll be no more sobbin' #

43
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:40,688
# When he starts throbbin' #

44
00:03:40,809 --> 00:03:43,528
# His own sweet song #

45
00:03:43,647 --> 00:03:44,486
# Wake up #

46
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,366
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

47
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:47,326
# Get up #

48
00:03:47,447 --> 00:03:49,406
# Get up, get out of bed #

49
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:50,565
# Cheer up #

50
00:03:50,686 --> 00:03:52,165
# Cheer up, the sun is red #

51
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,243
# Live, love,
laugh, and be happy... #

52
00:04:00,842 --> 00:04:03,601
I want to go over
to my place...

53
00:04:03,722 --> 00:04:06,880
and start,
you know, getting it on...

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,880
I was terrible.

55
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:09,838
Yeah?

56
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,918
Did you ever, uh...
take ballet?

57
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,958
Be thankful.

58
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:15,758
Do you have a quarter for them?

59
00:04:15,877 --> 00:04:17,396
Yes, I do.

60
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:24,314
# Bob, bob, bob, bob,
bobbin' along #

61
00:04:24,435 --> 00:04:25,355
# Wake up #

62
00:04:25,474 --> 00:04:27,514
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

63
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:29,993
# Da da da da da da #

64
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:40,549
Well, what about me?

65
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:44,549
You'll see.

66
00:04:44,668 --> 00:04:46,867
A lot of fun you are.

67
00:04:46,988 --> 00:04:48,666
You're supposed to tease me...

68
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,626
give me hints,
make me guess, you know.

69
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:06,821
Oh, look. That's terrible.

70
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:09,420
He's not hurting anyone.

71
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:13,979
Neither are we.

72
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:16,018
Oh, God.

73
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:19,337
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

74
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,937
I always think the same thing.

75
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,937
What do you think?

76
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:25,735
I always think...

77
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:28,774
that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

78
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,214
Really, I do.

79
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:33,092
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

80
00:05:33,213 --> 00:05:35,732
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him...

81
00:05:35,853 --> 00:05:37,572
and now there he is...

82
00:05:37,693 --> 00:05:39,211
half dead on a park bench...

83
00:05:39,332 --> 00:05:41,731
and where are
his mother or his father...

84
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:43,809
all his uncles now?

85
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,929
Anyway, that's
what I always think.

86
00:05:47,049 --> 00:05:49,328
How's he doing up there?

87
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:51,328
When they had
the newspaper strike...

88
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,686
We're gettin' better than 40%.

89
00:05:53,807 --> 00:05:55,886
How about second position?

90
00:06:00,085 --> 00:06:02,044
It's not so good.

91
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,959
Uh-oh. What have we here?

92
00:06:21,078 --> 00:06:23,917
Come on, babies,
wet your lips there.

93
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,357
Give me some tongue.

94
00:06:25,477 --> 00:06:26,796
Just a little tongue.

95
00:06:26,917 --> 00:06:28,036
Come on.

96
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:33,715
How about a nice
wet French kiss now?

97
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:36,113
Come on. A nice wet one.

98
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,113
Pay attention
to your recordings.

99
00:06:40,913 --> 00:06:42,711
She's coming in loud and clear.

100
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:45,111
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

101
00:06:45,231 --> 00:06:47,670
The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.

102
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:49,589
There with the shopping bag.

103
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:51,508
Well, that's it for Paul.

104
00:06:51,629 --> 00:06:52,948
They spotted him.

105
00:06:53,069 --> 00:06:54,508
Give me the phones.

106
00:06:54,629 --> 00:06:57,747
He's been following us all around.

107
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,306
It's nothing. Don't worry about it.

108
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:03,065
We're spending too much time
together here.

109
00:07:03,185 --> 00:07:04,984
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

110
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,617
I got burned, Harry.

111
00:07:28,738 --> 00:07:30,057
She looked at me.

112
00:07:30,177 --> 00:07:31,496
I know. We heard.

113
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,936
Oh, did we hear.

114
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:35,215
What do you think?

115
00:07:36,296 --> 00:07:38,494
I got some
good pieces, maybe 25%.

116
00:07:43,893 --> 00:07:45,571
Paul, I'll call you
in a couple days...

117
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:46,971
if I need you.

118
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,850
Paul, you going
to the convention tomorrow?

119
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:50,810
You bet.

120
00:07:50,931 --> 00:07:52,970
Hey, how about you, Harry?

121
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:54,049
Yeah. Maybe.

122
00:07:54,169 --> 00:07:56,888
Little party like we did
two years ago?

123
00:07:57,009 --> 00:07:57,848
Huh?

124
00:07:57,969 --> 00:07:59,128
Hey, Stan?

125
00:07:59,248 --> 00:08:00,567
See you, Harry.

126
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:01,648
Okay.

127
00:08:01,767 --> 00:08:02,606
Here.

128
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:11,923
He's a nice guy for a cop.

129
00:08:12,044 --> 00:08:13,483
You go.

130
00:08:13,604 --> 00:08:15,683
I'll stay here a while.

131
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:18,562
Who's interested
in these two anyway?

132
00:08:18,682 --> 00:08:20,961
I don't know for sure.

133
00:08:21,081 --> 00:08:22,400
The Justice Department?

134
00:08:22,521 --> 00:08:24,080
No.

135
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,359
I figure it must be
the Infernal Revenue.

136
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,238
Their tapes always
put me to sleep.

137
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:32,078
Since when are you
here to be entertained?

138
00:08:32,198 --> 00:08:34,797
Sometimes it's nice to know
what they're talking about.

139
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:37,675
I don't care what
they're talking about.

140
00:08:37,796 --> 00:08:40,954
All I want is
a nice, fat recording.

141
00:09:42,335 --> 00:09:43,655
Hello, Mr Caul.

142
00:09:44,855 --> 00:09:46,374
And happy birthday.

143
00:10:26,962 --> 00:10:28,761
Happy birthday, Harry.

144
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,399
Happy birthday.

145
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:08,189
Hello.

146
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,267
Hello, uh, Mrs Evangelista?

147
00:11:10,388 --> 00:11:11,227
Uh, yes.

148
00:11:11,348 --> 00:11:13,667
This is Harry Caul
from upstairs.

149
00:11:13,787 --> 00:11:15,666
Uh, uh...

150
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:16,786
Yes.

151
00:11:16,907 --> 00:11:18,145
Well...

152
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:19,785
Thank you very much.

153
00:11:19,906 --> 00:11:20,744
Thank you.

154
00:11:20,865 --> 00:11:22,424
Uh-huh.

155
00:11:22,545 --> 00:11:24,864
Yes, well,
you're really very nice.

156
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:26,783
Yes.

157
00:11:26,863 --> 00:11:28,022
Uh, but...

158
00:11:28,143 --> 00:11:29,702
I know, uh...

159
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,461
Yes, I found it. Yes.

160
00:11:32,581 --> 00:11:35,860
But what I wanted to talk
to you about was, uh...

161
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:38,860
How did you put it
in the apartment?

162
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,299
Uh-huh.

163
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:43,098
Right.

164
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:46,257
Well, what about the alarm?

165
00:11:47,577 --> 00:11:48,936
Oh, you did?

166
00:11:52,615 --> 00:11:53,454
Well...

167
00:11:53,575 --> 00:11:54,414
uh...

168
00:11:54,534 --> 00:11:57,293
I thought I had the only key.

169
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:58,333
Uh-huh.

170
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,651
Well, what emergency
could possibly...

171
00:12:03,772 --> 00:12:05,091
All right.

172
00:12:05,211 --> 00:12:06,050
Yes.

173
00:12:06,171 --> 00:12:08,929
Well, see, I would
be perfectly happy...

174
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,329
to have all
my personal things...

175
00:12:11,449 --> 00:12:13,248
burned up in a fire...

176
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,648
because I don't
have anything personal.

177
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:17,087
Nothing of value.

178
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,006
Nothing personal
except my keys...

179
00:12:19,127 --> 00:12:22,206
which I would like
to have the only copy of...

180
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,325
Mrs Evangelista.

181
00:12:25,925 --> 00:12:26,844
Mrs Evangelista...

182
00:12:26,965 --> 00:12:29,723
how'd you know
it was my birthday?

183
00:12:29,844 --> 00:12:32,123
Nah. I don't remember
telling you.

184
00:12:32,243 --> 00:12:36,281
Would you like to take
a guess how old I am?

185
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:39,160
44. Well,
that's a very good guess.

186
00:12:39,281 --> 00:12:40,600
Mrs Evangelista...

187
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,638
as of today, my mail
will go to a post office box...

188
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:48,517
with a combination on it
and no keys.

189
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:49,557
Goodbye.

190
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:07,053
Morning, Harry.

191
00:14:07,173 --> 00:14:08,012
Morning.

192
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,732
There's an article in here...

193
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:10,891
about the convention.

194
00:14:11,012 --> 00:14:12,331
It mentions your name.

195
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,250
You're one of the notables...

196
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:15,691
who's going tomorrow night.

197
00:14:15,811 --> 00:14:18,090
I told them I'd be there.

198
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,570
Listen to this here.

199
00:14:20,729 --> 00:14:22,128
Listen.

200
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:24,527
"Among those
pre-eminent in the field...

201
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,968
expected to attend...

202
00:14:26,087 --> 00:14:28,366
are Hal Lipset and Harry Caul...

203
00:14:28,487 --> 00:14:29,806
from San Francisco.

204
00:14:29,926 --> 00:14:31,245
Kenneth Sperry will speak...

205
00:14:31,366 --> 00:14:33,165
on Surveillance and The Law.

206
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:34,165
Wait a minute.

207
00:14:34,285 --> 00:14:37,723
Listen to this.
Where the hell is it?

208
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:40,362
"Also attending
will be William P. Moran...

209
00:14:40,483 --> 00:14:41,322
of Detroit, Michigan."

210
00:14:41,443 --> 00:14:44,521
Since when did William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan...

211
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,401
become pre-eminent in the field?

212
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:48,320
Oh, he's very big there.

213
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,119
You want some coffee?

214
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,638
He's the guy
that told Chrysler...

215
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:57,717
that Cadillac was
getting rid of its fins.

216
00:14:57,838 --> 00:14:59,077
It was a while ago...

217
00:14:59,197 --> 00:15:02,077
but it was a big thing
at the time.

218
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,272
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

219
00:15:14,393 --> 00:15:15,631
Shopping bag...

220
00:15:15,752 --> 00:15:16,672
unit "A".

221
00:15:24,629 --> 00:15:26,428
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

222
00:15:26,548 --> 00:15:28,468
Parabolic, unit "B".

223
00:15:35,586 --> 00:15:37,745
December 2nd, 1 p.m.

224
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,704
City of Paris, unit "C".

225
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:04,697
# Wake up #

226
00:16:04,817 --> 00:16:05,935
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

227
00:16:06,056 --> 00:16:08,335
# Da da da da da da #

228
00:16:08,455 --> 00:16:09,854
What do you think?

229
00:16:09,975 --> 00:16:13,413
I don't know what I'm going
to get him for Christmas yet.

230
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:14,694
He's already got everything.

231
00:16:14,813 --> 00:16:17,092
He doesn't need
anything any more.

232
00:16:17,213 --> 00:16:18,092
Well...

233
00:16:18,212 --> 00:16:20,451
I haven't decided
what I'm going...

234
00:16:20,572 --> 00:16:21,891
to get you yet.

235
00:16:29,649 --> 00:16:31,448
...get him for Christmas yet.

236
00:16:31,568 --> 00:16:32,847
He's already got everything.

237
00:16:32,968 --> 00:16:35,247
He doesn't need
anything any more.

238
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:39,725
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

239
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:41,965
Well, you better start looking.

240
00:16:42,085 --> 00:16:43,564
Well, what about me?

241
00:16:44,844 --> 00:16:46,563
You'll see.

242
00:16:46,684 --> 00:16:49,442
Whoo! A lot of fun you are.

243
00:16:49,563 --> 00:16:51,362
You're supposed to tease me...

244
00:16:51,482 --> 00:16:52,802
give me hints...

245
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:54,720
make me guess, you know.

246
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:56,160
Does it bother you?

247
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,120
What?

248
00:16:57,241 --> 00:16:59,079
Walking around
in circles.

249
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:04,518
Oh, look. That's terrible.

250
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:06,437
He's not hurting anyone.

251
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:07,956
Neither are we.

252
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:13,874
Oh, God.

253
00:17:13,996 --> 00:17:17,834
Every time I see one
of those old guys, I...

254
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:28,270
Every time I see one
of those old guys...

255
00:17:28,391 --> 00:17:30,790
I always think
the same thing.

256
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:32,229
What do you think?

257
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,348
I always think he was once
somebody's baby boy.

258
00:17:36,468 --> 00:17:38,027
No, really, I do.

259
00:17:38,147 --> 00:17:40,905
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

260
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:43,585
and he had
a mother and a father...

261
00:17:43,706 --> 00:17:45,025
who loved him...

262
00:17:45,145 --> 00:17:45,984
and now there he is...

263
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,664
half dead on a park bench...

264
00:17:47,784 --> 00:17:50,063
and where are his
mother or his father...

265
00:17:50,184 --> 00:17:51,503
all his uncles now?

266
00:17:51,623 --> 00:17:55,022
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

267
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:58,860
I always think how, when
they had the newspaper strike...

268
00:17:58,981 --> 00:18:01,179
more of those old guys died.

269
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:04,779
50 of them froze
to death in one night.

270
00:18:41,448 --> 00:18:42,287
Good afternoon.

271
00:18:42,408 --> 00:18:43,727
May I help you?

272
00:18:43,847 --> 00:18:46,645
Yes. Extension 746, please.

273
00:18:46,766 --> 00:18:48,126
One moment, please.

274
00:18:49,765 --> 00:18:50,604
Director's office.

275
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:52,964
Uh, yes, this is Mr Caul.

276
00:18:55,044 --> 00:18:56,363
I have the material.

277
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,282
I'm calling
for an appointment.

278
00:18:58,402 --> 00:18:59,401
I'm sorry.

279
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:02,281
The director has already
left for the day.

280
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:04,041
We'll call you back
tomorrow morning.

281
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:06,440
May I have
your telephone number, please?

282
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,880
I'm at a payphone...

283
00:19:07,999 --> 00:19:10,278
and I don't have
a home telephone.

284
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,078
Hold on one moment, please.

285
00:19:18,077 --> 00:19:18,916
Mr Caul?

286
00:19:19,036 --> 00:19:19,875
Yes?

287
00:19:19,996 --> 00:19:21,315
2:30 tomorrow afternoon.

288
00:19:21,435 --> 00:19:22,754
2:30 in the afternoon?

289
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,634
Is that payment in full?

290
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:27,114
Whatever was arranged.

291
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:29,953
Thank you very much.

292
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:31,352
I'll be there.

293
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:47,488
Harry?

294
00:20:47,609 --> 00:20:48,448
Hello, Amy.

295
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:51,687
I didn't think you were coming.

296
00:20:55,566 --> 00:20:58,845
I brought some wine, um...

297
00:20:58,965 --> 00:21:01,723
someone gave me
as a birthday present.

298
00:21:03,524 --> 00:21:06,243
I didn't know
it was your birthday.

299
00:21:06,363 --> 00:21:07,682
You want some?

300
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:08,801
Yeah.

301
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:10,160
I do.

302
00:21:20,598 --> 00:21:22,437
How old are you, Harry?

303
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:25,556
42.

304
00:21:29,996 --> 00:21:30,835
Sweet.

305
00:21:34,953 --> 00:21:37,232
Does something special
happen between us...

306
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:38,672
on your birthday?

307
00:21:38,792 --> 00:21:40,231
Like what?

308
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:41,991
Something personal.

309
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:46,310
What?

310
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:50,349
Like, uh, telling me
about yourself...

311
00:21:50,469 --> 00:21:52,547
your secrets.

312
00:22:08,743 --> 00:22:10,582
I don't have any secrets.

313
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:15,821
I'm your secret.

314
00:22:15,941 --> 00:22:17,739
You do have secrets, Harry.

315
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,099
I know you do.

316
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,140
No.

317
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,058
Sometimes you come over here...

318
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:23,978
and you don't tell me.

319
00:22:24,098 --> 00:22:26,857
Once I saw you
up by the staircase...

320
00:22:26,978 --> 00:22:27,816
hiding...

321
00:22:27,937 --> 00:22:29,496
watching...

322
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:31,496
for a whole hour.

323
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:39,413
You think you're going
to catch me at something.

324
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,013
You know?

325
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:44,212
I know. A woman can always tell.

326
00:22:45,851 --> 00:22:49,250
You have a certain way
of opening the door.

327
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,888
First the key
goes in real quiet...

328
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:56,768
and then the door
comes open real fast...

329
00:22:56,888 --> 00:22:59,767
like you think you'll
catch me at something.

330
00:23:12,004 --> 00:23:14,762
Sometimes I even think
you're listening to me...

331
00:23:14,883 --> 00:23:17,562
when I'm talking
on the telephone.

332
00:23:19,002 --> 00:23:20,800
What are you talking about?

333
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:22,240
I don't know.

334
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,679
I just feel it.

335
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,319
Really, I do.

336
00:23:33,357 --> 00:23:34,676
# Wake up #

337
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:38,355
# Wake up, you sleepyhead #

338
00:23:38,476 --> 00:23:39,555
# Get up #

339
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:41,754
# Get up, get out... #

340
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:43,713
Why are you singing that?

341
00:23:45,073 --> 00:23:46,432
It's pretty.

342
00:23:54,511 --> 00:23:55,909
What's the matter?

343
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:57,469
Nothing.

344
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:59,868
It's just that, uh...

345
00:23:59,989 --> 00:24:02,828
somebody else
was singing that today.

346
00:24:02,948 --> 00:24:04,466
A girl?

347
00:24:04,587 --> 00:24:05,706
Yes.

348
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:06,945
Who is she?

349
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,386
No. No. If isn't...

350
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:09,345
I'm jealous.

351
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:10,305
No.

352
00:24:10,426 --> 00:24:11,745
Just somebody at work...

353
00:24:11,865 --> 00:24:13,264
and she, uh...

354
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,902
She reminded me of you.

355
00:24:22,941 --> 00:24:24,740
Where do you work, Harry?

356
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,099
Oh, different places,
different...

357
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,779
jobs, you know?

358
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,178
I'm kind of, uh,
a musician, you see.

359
00:24:34,297 --> 00:24:35,416
Oh.

360
00:24:38,296 --> 00:24:40,575
Freelance musician and, uh...

361
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,095
Uh-huh.

362
00:24:45,655 --> 00:24:46,974
Where do you live?

363
00:24:47,094 --> 00:24:49,852
Why can't I call you
over there?

364
00:24:49,973 --> 00:24:52,491
'Cause I don't have a telephone.

365
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:56,531
Do you live alone?

366
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:04,328
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

367
00:25:05,448 --> 00:25:07,047
'Cause it's your birthday.

368
00:25:10,366 --> 00:25:14,084
I don't want people asking me
a lot of questions.

369
00:25:15,165 --> 00:25:16,963
I want to know you.

370
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:22,083
Yes, I live alone.

371
00:25:23,483 --> 00:25:24,322
Oh.

372
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:28,960
I don't feel like
answering any more questions.

373
00:25:36,438 --> 00:25:37,957
Your rent is due.

374
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:40,996
Here's the money for it.

375
00:26:09,428 --> 00:26:12,387
You never used to ask
a lot of questions.

376
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:16,225
Harry, I was so happy
when you came over tonight.

377
00:26:16,346 --> 00:26:18,785
When I heard you open the door...

378
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:21,225
my toes were dancing
under the covers.

379
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:26,022
But I don't think I'm going
to wait for you any more.

380
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,599
I have a package
for the director.

381
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,518
All right. I'll take it.

382
00:27:41,639 --> 00:27:44,158
No. I'm supposed to
hand it to him personally.

383
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:45,598
I have an appointment.

384
00:27:45,718 --> 00:27:47,037
Are you Mr Caul?

385
00:27:47,158 --> 00:27:48,477
Yes, I am.

386
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:50,876
A Mr Caul is here. All right.

387
00:27:50,997 --> 00:27:52,316
Make yourself comfortable.

388
00:27:52,436 --> 00:27:54,715
The director's assistant
will be right down.

389
00:28:32,184 --> 00:28:34,942
There are some nice
Christmas cookies I made. Want one?

390
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:36,062
They're good.

391
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:37,542
No, thanks. I...

392
00:29:05,054 --> 00:29:06,373
What do you see?

393
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:07,812
Oh, not much.

394
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:10,691
Here's your money..
$ 15.000 cash, as you asked.

395
00:29:10,812 --> 00:29:12,131
These are our tapes?

396
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:14,690
I had an arrangement
with the director.

397
00:29:14,811 --> 00:29:17,090
I was to give those
to him personally.

398
00:29:17,209 --> 00:29:19,488
I understand.
He's not here this afternoon.

399
00:29:19,609 --> 00:29:21,408
He's out of the country.

400
00:29:21,529 --> 00:29:25,047
He asked me to get the tapes
and give you the money.

401
00:29:46,081 --> 00:29:48,880
I guess I can just wait on this.

402
00:29:54,758 --> 00:29:58,476
Now, look, don't get involved
in this, Mr Caul.

403
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,395
These tapes are dangerous.

404
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:04,274
You heard them.
You know what I mean.

405
00:30:04,395 --> 00:30:06,074
Someone may get hurt.

406
00:30:15,351 --> 00:30:17,750
Mr Caul, be careful.

407
00:32:08,636 --> 00:32:09,955
Well, what about me?

408
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:11,395
You'll see.

409
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:14,274
Whoo! A lot of fun you are.

410
00:32:17,994 --> 00:32:19,832
# When the red, red robin #

411
00:32:19,913 --> 00:32:23,071
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

412
00:32:23,192 --> 00:32:24,631
# Along #

413
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,269
Who started
this conversation anyhow?

414
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:32,748
You did.

415
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,587
I did not.

416
00:32:34,708 --> 00:32:37,467
Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.

417
00:32:43,865 --> 00:32:45,744
Pretend like
I just told you a joke.

418
00:32:45,825 --> 00:32:47,984
Ha ha ha ha.

419
00:32:50,703 --> 00:32:52,382
Does it bother you?

420
00:32:52,502 --> 00:32:53,341
What?

421
00:32:53,462 --> 00:32:55,382
Walking around in circles.

422
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:58,580
Oh, look. That's terrible.

423
00:32:58,701 --> 00:33:01,499
He's not hurting anyone.

424
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,019
Neither are we.

425
00:33:05,338 --> 00:33:06,817
Oh, God.

426
00:33:06,938 --> 00:33:10,177
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

427
00:33:10,297 --> 00:33:12,576
I always think the same thing.

428
00:33:12,696 --> 00:33:14,016
What do you think?

429
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:15,934
Yeah, what do you think?

430
00:33:16,055 --> 00:33:19,093
I always think
that he was once some--

431
00:33:21,734 --> 00:33:24,932
Hey, Harry, what do you say
we take a break?

432
00:33:25,053 --> 00:33:28,491
We'll go to AI's Transbay.
I'll buy you a beer.

433
00:33:28,612 --> 00:33:30,290
No. I want to finish this.

434
00:33:30,411 --> 00:33:32,690
I thought you turned
those tapes in.

435
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,729
Stan, be quiet, will you?

436
00:33:37,209 --> 00:33:39,967
Do you think we can do this?

437
00:33:40,088 --> 00:33:41,886
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

438
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:43,806
What a stupid conversation.

439
00:33:43,926 --> 00:33:46,205
Stan, please.
I'm trying to work.

440
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:48,085
I'm tired of mostly everything.

441
00:33:48,205 --> 00:33:49,525
Tired of me?

442
00:33:49,644 --> 00:33:52,483
Tired of you... but not today.

443
00:33:53,883 --> 00:33:56,801
What the hell they talking about,
for Christ's sakes?

444
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:59,680
Stanley, please,
I'm trying to get this done.

445
00:33:59,801 --> 00:34:01,600
All right. Don't get excited.

446
00:34:01,721 --> 00:34:04,320
Well, I'm getting fed up.

447
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,519
About what?

448
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,278
About your asking me questions
all day long.

449
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,638
Jesus.

450
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,757
Don't say that.

451
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:14,357
Well, for Christ's sakes!

452
00:34:14,477 --> 00:34:16,275
Stan, don't say that
again, please.

453
00:34:16,396 --> 00:34:18,195
Don't use that word in vain.

454
00:34:18,316 --> 00:34:19,675
It bothers me.

455
00:34:21,195 --> 00:34:22,554
What's the matter, Harry?

456
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:26,752
Your work's getting sloppy.

457
00:34:29,832 --> 00:34:33,470
Later in the week,
Sunday maybe.

458
00:34:33,591 --> 00:34:35,750
Sunday definitely.

459
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:39,469
We'd have a much better track...

460
00:34:39,589 --> 00:34:41,828
if you'd paid more attention
to the recording...

461
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,227
and less to what
they were talking about.

462
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:47,426
Why do questions about
what's going on bother you?

463
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:50,305
I can't explain
the personal problems of my clients.

464
00:34:55,664 --> 00:34:57,144
Jack Tar Hotel.

465
00:34:59,383 --> 00:35:00,222
3:00.

466
00:35:00,343 --> 00:35:02,902
Room 773.

467
00:35:03,022 --> 00:35:05,181
If you filled me in
once in a while...

468
00:35:05,302 --> 00:35:06,181
Ever think of that?

469
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:08,539
It has nothing to do
with either of us.

470
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,619
It's curiosity,
goddam human nature.

471
00:35:13,659 --> 00:35:15,938
Listen, if there's
one sure-fire rule...

472
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:17,856
I've learned
in this business is...

473
00:35:17,977 --> 00:35:20,735
I don't know anything about
human nature or curiosity.

474
00:35:20,856 --> 00:35:23,614
That's not part of what I do.

475
00:35:23,735 --> 00:35:26,294
This is my business,
and when I'm...

476
00:35:34,412 --> 00:35:35,731
I'll see you later.

477
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:54,525
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

478
00:36:00,404 --> 00:36:01,803
I love you.

479
00:36:01,924 --> 00:36:04,682
We're spending too much time
together here.

480
00:36:04,803 --> 00:36:07,482
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

481
00:36:21,917 --> 00:36:24,596
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

482
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:43,771
He'd kill us
if he got the chance.

483
00:38:04,565 --> 00:38:07,323
He'd kill us
if he got the chance.

484
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,789
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

485
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:01,947
It's been three months
since my last confession.

486
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:04,746
I...

487
00:39:09,585 --> 00:39:11,024
These are my sins.

488
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:16,902
I've taken
the Lord's name in vain...

489
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:18,662
on several occasions.

490
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:22,581
I...

491
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,858
On a number of occasions, I've
taken newspapers from the racks...

492
00:39:29,978 --> 00:39:32,257
without paying for them.

493
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:33,217
I...

494
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:41,815
have deliberately taken pleasure
in impure thoughts...

495
00:39:41,895 --> 00:39:43,094
and...

496
00:39:44,334 --> 00:39:46,853
I've been involved
in some work...

497
00:39:46,973 --> 00:39:49,252
that I think will be used...

498
00:39:49,373 --> 00:39:51,652
to hurt these two young people.

499
00:39:51,771 --> 00:39:53,770
It's happened to me before.

500
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,650
People were hurt
because of my... my work.

501
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,529
I'm... I'm afraid
it could happen again...

502
00:39:59,649 --> 00:40:02,408
and I... I was in no way
responsible.

503
00:40:02,529 --> 00:40:03,888
I'm not responsible.

504
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:07,726
For these and all the sins
of my past life...

505
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:09,166
I am heartily sorry.

506
00:40:20,403 --> 00:40:22,122
Hi. Can I help you?

507
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,481
You could explain
your system to me.

508
00:40:24,602 --> 00:40:26,400
Mr Caul,
I'm Jim Storey.

509
00:40:26,521 --> 00:40:27,881
How do you do?

510
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,679
Come in and take a look
at the system.

511
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,598
This is for
the surveillance...

512
00:40:32,719 --> 00:40:34,518
of telephone
communication systems.

513
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:35,638
I see.

514
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:36,597
Now available.

515
00:40:36,718 --> 00:40:38,517
Here's the new LT 500.

516
00:40:38,638 --> 00:40:42,996
If you're in surveillance,
you belong into the LT 500.

517
00:40:43,116 --> 00:40:44,755
You can hear...

518
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:48,314
and know exactly which door
has been violated.

519
00:40:48,434 --> 00:40:51,192
And you got your local alarms
on the doors...

520
00:40:51,313 --> 00:40:53,112
which I'm sure you've heard.

521
00:40:53,233 --> 00:40:54,432
It's quite noisy.

522
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,832
It has a Super 8mm
camera in here...

523
00:40:56,951 --> 00:40:58,750
and the dot, the 10:00 dot...

524
00:40:58,871 --> 00:41:01,629
will show exactly what
the camera sees on the back.

525
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:03,549
It's a magazine-loaded camera.

526
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:04,749
Super 8mm...

527
00:41:04,869 --> 00:41:06,188
William P. Moran.

528
00:41:06,309 --> 00:41:09,148
William P. Moran
of Detroit, Michigan.

529
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,626
House courtesy telephone,
please.

530
00:41:14,946 --> 00:41:17,704
That's your automatic
recorder actuator.

531
00:41:17,825 --> 00:41:19,864
It undetectably
starts the recorder...

532
00:41:19,984 --> 00:41:21,863
when the phone is lifted...

533
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:25,701
and shuts it off
when the receiver is put back.

534
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:26,661
What?

535
00:41:26,782 --> 00:41:28,901
It's real nice, you know.

536
00:41:29,021 --> 00:41:31,061
It's not your old-fashioned
voice actuator...

537
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,979
you know,
always starting the recorder...

538
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,419
when nobody was talking...

539
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,419
or shutting it off
in the middle...

540
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:37,858
of an important conversation.

541
00:41:37,979 --> 00:41:39,698
Is it like the Moran actuator?

542
00:41:39,778 --> 00:41:42,577
The Moran E-27 is a copy.

543
00:41:42,658 --> 00:41:45,296
I won't let him even
smell my equipment any more.

544
00:41:45,417 --> 00:41:46,736
You in surveillance?

545
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:47,695
Yeah.

546
00:41:47,816 --> 00:41:49,614
Law enforcement
or private operator?

547
00:41:49,735 --> 00:41:50,614
Private.

548
00:41:50,735 --> 00:41:53,974
You mind if I take
your name and address...

549
00:41:54,093 --> 00:41:55,413
for our mailing list?

550
00:41:55,533 --> 00:41:57,052
Harry Cau... Harry Caul?

551
00:41:57,173 --> 00:41:58,492
I didn't recognize you.

552
00:41:58,612 --> 00:42:01,370
Say, I wonder,
would you take a Model 510-A?

553
00:42:01,491 --> 00:42:03,689
Free of charge. Just to test it.

554
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,609
You know, say, in return for...

555
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,968
that we could print
in our flier that you use it.

556
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:11,368
I build all my own equipment.
Thank you.

557
00:42:11,488 --> 00:42:14,726
Maybe we could take a picture
of you by our booth.

558
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:17,046
It would be a great honour
for Spectre.

559
00:43:00,393 --> 00:43:02,192
This is not helping crime.

560
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:03,672
It's helping justice...

561
00:43:18,587 --> 00:43:21,386
That may be affixed to
the subject's automobile--

562
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:22,506
Slide.

563
00:43:22,626 --> 00:43:25,345
and will transmit
a pulsating tone signal--

564
00:43:25,465 --> 00:43:26,304
Slide.

565
00:43:26,425 --> 00:43:27,744
which is highly detectable.

566
00:43:27,864 --> 00:43:29,543
Harry, good to see you.

567
00:43:29,664 --> 00:43:30,902
Beautiful suit.

568
00:43:31,023 --> 00:43:32,342
You like it? It's French.

569
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:33,663
Oh.

570
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:36,541
Let's go get a drink and talk.

571
00:43:36,661 --> 00:43:39,420
Requiring no knowledge
or skill in electronics.

572
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:41,420
Come on. It's a bore.

573
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,738
The TA-30 may be
installed and concealed...

574
00:43:46,859 --> 00:43:50,177
under the dash
in a matter of seconds.

575
00:43:50,298 --> 00:43:54,016
Hey, come on. There's somebody
I want you to meet...

576
00:43:54,136 --> 00:43:55,456
a competitor of yours.

577
00:43:55,575 --> 00:43:56,895
Hey, Bernie, old buddy.

578
00:43:57,016 --> 00:43:58,335
Yeah, Paulie, what's up?

579
00:43:58,455 --> 00:44:00,653
This is Harry Caul.
William P. Moran.

580
00:44:00,774 --> 00:44:02,093
Harry Caul, my pleasure.

581
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:03,533
My friends call me Bernie.

582
00:44:03,653 --> 00:44:05,572
I heard a lot about you.

583
00:44:05,693 --> 00:44:07,372
Bernie just moved in
from Detroit.

584
00:44:07,492 --> 00:44:09,771
He's the fella
that let Chrysler know...

585
00:44:09,891 --> 00:44:11,690
Cadillac was
discontinuing its fins.

586
00:44:11,811 --> 00:44:13,010
I heard.

587
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,409
You're a tough man
to get ahold of.

588
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:18,768
I've been wanting
to talk to you for a long time.

589
00:44:18,888 --> 00:44:20,727
Take five. We'll get a drink.

590
00:44:20,848 --> 00:44:22,847
Maybe in a couple minutes.

591
00:44:22,968 --> 00:44:25,646
Honey, sweetheart,
show time, all right?

592
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:29,405
I'd appreciate if you stuck around
for the demonstration.

593
00:44:29,485 --> 00:44:31,924
Um, ladies and gentlemen.

594
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,684
Ladies and gentlemen.

595
00:44:33,804 --> 00:44:36,243
Ladies and gentlemen,
what we have here...

596
00:44:36,363 --> 00:44:39,122
is the Moran S-15
harmonica tap.

597
00:44:39,242 --> 00:44:41,521
This electronic marvel
can be installed...

598
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:43,920
in a matter of two minutes.

599
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,759
Notice here it has its own
nickel cadmium power source...

600
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:50,638
so it cannot be detected
on the line.

601
00:44:50,759 --> 00:44:52,878
Once installed,
it can be phoned...

602
00:44:52,998 --> 00:44:55,318
from any telephone
in the world...

603
00:44:55,397 --> 00:44:56,716
Singapore, Karachi, even Moscow.

604
00:44:56,837 --> 00:44:59,756
I say Moscow 'cause
you look Russian, sir...

605
00:44:59,875 --> 00:45:01,195
with the beard.

606
00:45:01,315 --> 00:45:03,114
Just dial the target's
phone number...

607
00:45:03,235 --> 00:45:05,033
pause before the last digit...

608
00:45:05,154 --> 00:45:07,433
blow the harmonica tone
into the phone...

609
00:45:07,553 --> 00:45:08,872
press the last digit.

610
00:45:08,993 --> 00:45:12,232
The phone will not ring
in the target's house.

611
00:45:12,351 --> 00:45:13,671
Instead, the receiver...

612
00:45:13,792 --> 00:45:16,550
will be turned into
an actual room microphone...

613
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,909
thus enabling surveillance
to take place.

614
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,788
And now, by way of
an actual demonstration...

615
00:45:21,909 --> 00:45:26,108
we've installed one of these units
in my very own home.

616
00:45:26,227 --> 00:45:28,506
I will now dial that number.

617
00:45:28,627 --> 00:45:29,466
Thank you.

618
00:45:34,225 --> 00:45:36,864
I pause before the last digit.

619
00:45:38,664 --> 00:45:39,543
Harmonica.

620
00:45:43,662 --> 00:45:45,821
I dial the last digit.

621
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:51,699
You will note the phone
does not ring.

622
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:54,099
Can we get away?

623
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,498
I don't know. Maybe I can.

624
00:45:56,618 --> 00:45:58,137
Where's your husband?

625
00:45:58,258 --> 00:46:00,257
He's out at a convention.

626
00:46:01,576 --> 00:46:03,375
When will he be back?

627
00:46:03,496 --> 00:46:04,815
Not until late.

628
00:46:04,936 --> 00:46:07,214
April Fool.
Just a little joke, folks.

629
00:46:07,334 --> 00:46:09,133
That shows you
the possibilities...

630
00:46:09,254 --> 00:46:11,052
Larry Peterson Burns.
Telephone call.

631
00:46:11,173 --> 00:46:13,452
Thank you. The demonstration
is concluded.

632
00:46:13,573 --> 00:46:16,731
I'd like you to take some
literature on your way.

633
00:46:16,811 --> 00:46:19,490
What did you think of that?
You like it?

634
00:46:19,611 --> 00:46:20,930
That's a good item.

635
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,969
Good for
the catalogue suckers, huh?

636
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:25,369
Here you go, Harry.
Have a free pen.

637
00:46:25,489 --> 00:46:26,328
You, too, Paulie.

638
00:46:26,449 --> 00:46:28,048
I'd rather have a free drink.

639
00:46:28,169 --> 00:46:29,687
Hey, me, too.

640
00:46:29,808 --> 00:46:31,607
Stanley, do me a favour, huh?

641
00:46:31,728 --> 00:46:33,526
Mind the booth, all right?

642
00:46:33,647 --> 00:46:35,446
That's what I pay you for.

643
00:46:35,566 --> 00:46:38,605
Just a couple of minutes
to get a drink.

644
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:40,124
Hi, Harry.

645
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:41,923
Hi, Stan.

646
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:42,883
That's right.

647
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:45,482
You two used to
work together, huh?

648
00:46:47,962 --> 00:46:51,280
That son of a bitch
stole my latest idea.

649
00:46:51,401 --> 00:46:53,680
A lot of nice ladies
are here tonight.

650
00:46:53,801 --> 00:46:55,520
Forget it.
She's a part-time nun.

651
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,438
Hey, Harry, where you going?

652
00:46:57,559 --> 00:46:58,958
Go on without me.

653
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:00,877
I'm going to talk to Stan.

654
00:47:00,958 --> 00:47:03,277
We'll meet you at
the chrome-dome exhibit.

655
00:47:03,398 --> 00:47:04,636
Don't be long, Harry.

656
00:47:14,834 --> 00:47:17,952
Since when are you
working for Moran, Stanley?

657
00:47:21,072 --> 00:47:22,551
Since yesterday.

658
00:47:22,671 --> 00:47:23,871
Mm-hmm.

659
00:47:23,951 --> 00:47:25,270
Listen, that wasn't serious.

660
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:27,709
That was just
a stupid argument.

661
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,109
That wasn't it, Harry.

662
00:47:29,229 --> 00:47:31,028
It's just time I moved up.

663
00:47:32,907 --> 00:47:35,665
I don't want you
telling him about my things.

664
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:37,145
It's not ethical.

665
00:47:37,226 --> 00:47:40,465
There's not much you
ever let me in on.

666
00:47:40,584 --> 00:47:42,904
Okay. I'll show you
some of the stuff.

667
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:44,823
You won't show me anything.

668
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,223
You'll keep it to yourself.

669
00:47:46,343 --> 00:47:47,982
You know damn well you will.

670
00:47:48,102 --> 00:47:50,421
No, really, Stan, wait a while.

671
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,340
Will you think about it?

672
00:47:52,461 --> 00:47:56,380
Don't do this to me now.

673
00:47:58,819 --> 00:48:00,617
Some guy's following me.

674
00:48:00,738 --> 00:48:02,537
Who?

675
00:48:02,657 --> 00:48:04,017
I don't know.

676
00:48:04,097 --> 00:48:07,016
It has something to do
with the assignment last week.

677
00:48:07,137 --> 00:48:11,335
I don't know what it's about,
but I don't like it.

678
00:48:11,455 --> 00:48:14,493
Okay, all right.

679
00:48:14,614 --> 00:48:17,053
Thanks, Stan.

680
00:48:20,892 --> 00:48:22,731
This is junk.

681
00:48:45,564 --> 00:48:47,843
You have reached
a disconnected number.

682
00:48:47,964 --> 00:48:50,922
Will you please make sure you...

683
00:48:58,800 --> 00:48:59,680
Information.

684
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,559
Number for
Amy Fredericks, please.

685
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,958
It's a new listing.

686
00:49:04,078 --> 00:49:05,917
One moment, please.

687
00:49:10,277 --> 00:49:13,995
Sir, I see no listing
for Amy Fredericks.

688
00:49:14,115 --> 00:49:15,595
Thank you.

689
00:49:38,588 --> 00:49:40,387
What are you doing here?

690
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:43,266
Take it easy.
I'm just a messenger.

691
00:49:43,387 --> 00:49:45,185
I brought you a drink.

692
00:49:45,306 --> 00:49:47,105
Why are you following me?

693
00:49:47,225 --> 00:49:49,504
I'm not following you.
I'm looking for you.

694
00:49:49,624 --> 00:49:51,023
There's a big difference.

695
00:49:51,144 --> 00:49:53,423
How'd you know I was here?

696
00:49:53,544 --> 00:49:55,543
It's a convention
of wiretappers...

697
00:49:55,662 --> 00:49:58,381
Oh, excuse me... surveillance
and security technicians.

698
00:49:58,501 --> 00:49:59,820
It was a snap.

699
00:49:59,941 --> 00:50:02,900
I'm not giving those tapes
to anybody but the director.

700
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:05,059
I know what you told me.

701
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,779
All right, what's the message?

702
00:50:06,899 --> 00:50:09,898
We want you to deliver
the tapes on Sunday, 1:00.

703
00:50:10,018 --> 00:50:11,337
The director will be there.

704
00:50:11,458 --> 00:50:13,936
He'll accept the tapes
from you, in person.

705
00:50:14,057 --> 00:50:16,336
You tell him
I'll think about it.

706
00:50:31,771 --> 00:50:32,651
Hey, Paulie!

707
00:50:32,731 --> 00:50:35,010
Come on!
Come on, let's go!

708
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,888
Lurleen and Millard,
get in the back there.

709
00:50:38,009 --> 00:50:39,368
Stanley, get in front!

710
00:50:39,449 --> 00:50:42,248
I'm trying to dress up
the boss, okay?

711
00:50:42,328 --> 00:50:43,647
Take one out here.

712
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:46,246
Bernie, it's a
come-as-you-are party.

713
00:50:46,366 --> 00:50:49,685
Wait a minute!
All the girls up front!

714
00:50:49,805 --> 00:50:51,845
I think you take a right...

715
00:50:51,925 --> 00:50:53,204
then a left...

716
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:55,924
Sons of bitches!
Those smart asses!

717
00:50:56,044 --> 00:50:58,562
Who the hell they think
they're tangling with?

718
00:50:58,643 --> 00:51:00,602
Easy, we're going
to have a party.

719
00:51:04,761 --> 00:51:05,999
Millard, make them stop.

720
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,119
Relax, honey.

721
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,519
Paul's the best tail man
in the country.

722
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:11,438
Meredith, do you hear that?

723
00:51:11,559 --> 00:51:12,438
Ha ha.

724
00:51:16,358 --> 00:51:17,197
Make-4, 111.

725
00:51:17,317 --> 00:51:18,637
I'm driving east on Lombard.

726
00:51:18,756 --> 00:51:22,635
I'd like a rolling 10-28 on...

727
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:25,834
California 5-6-0...

728
00:51:25,955 --> 00:51:28,153
Boy Adam Lincoln.

729
00:51:28,274 --> 00:51:30,513
What are you calling
for a 10-28 for?

730
00:51:30,632 --> 00:51:32,232
Thanks.

731
00:51:34,992 --> 00:51:39,270
Hey, Willie Sanchez...
33654 14th Street...

732
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,710
162 pounds...

733
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:43,308
5' 10 1/2" shit head!

734
00:51:54,746 --> 00:51:58,305
Want me to pick
that lock for you, Harry?

735
00:51:58,424 --> 00:52:00,223
Hey, this'll be the bar.

736
00:52:00,344 --> 00:52:01,663
It's freezing in here.

737
00:52:01,783 --> 00:52:03,062
Oh, boy, Harry.

738
00:52:03,183 --> 00:52:04,022
Okay.

739
00:52:04,142 --> 00:52:06,901
All right, the bar is now open.

740
00:52:07,021 --> 00:52:07,860
Stanley.

741
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:08,820
Yes, sir.

742
00:52:08,941 --> 00:52:10,739
How about a little music?

743
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:13,139
The man wants a little music.

744
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,659
Harry, you got a nice shop here.

745
00:52:30,654 --> 00:52:33,893
I was rereading Dear Abby
the other night.

746
00:52:34,013 --> 00:52:37,251
There was a letter from a fella
called "Lonely and Anonymous."

747
00:52:37,372 --> 00:52:39,171
I think it was Harry.

748
00:52:39,292 --> 00:52:41,250
Hey!

749
00:52:42,571 --> 00:52:43,450
Ahh.

750
00:52:43,571 --> 00:52:45,330
Where's the club soda?

751
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:49,368
Let me tell you
something about Harry Caul.

752
00:52:49,488 --> 00:52:50,687
There you go.

753
00:52:50,808 --> 00:52:52,807
I know you heard this
a thousand times...

754
00:52:52,927 --> 00:52:54,646
but let me say it again.

755
00:52:54,767 --> 00:52:56,086
Here's to Harry...

756
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,525
the best, bar none.

757
00:52:57,646 --> 00:52:58,965
I'll drink to that.

758
00:52:59,085 --> 00:53:00,284
Best what?

759
00:53:00,365 --> 00:53:03,123
The best bugger
on the West Coast.

760
00:53:03,244 --> 00:53:06,002
Who's the best bugger
on the East Coast?

761
00:53:06,123 --> 00:53:06,962
Me.

762
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,881
I'll drink to that, too.

763
00:53:09,002 --> 00:53:10,121
I'll bet you will.

764
00:53:10,242 --> 00:53:11,841
I'll bet you will.

765
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,839
It's funny we never bumped
into each other in New York.

766
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:20,278
Why is that funny?

767
00:53:20,399 --> 00:53:22,757
We're in the same
business, same city.

768
00:53:22,878 --> 00:53:25,197
I figure we'd bump
into each other.

769
00:53:25,277 --> 00:53:27,556
I didn't know
you came from New York.

770
00:53:27,676 --> 00:53:30,435
Are you kidding?
Harry's famous in New York.

771
00:53:30,556 --> 00:53:33,474
You know the only one
I couldn't figure out?

772
00:53:33,595 --> 00:53:37,313
The welfare fund back in '68.

773
00:53:37,434 --> 00:53:39,232
How'd you know about that?

774
00:53:39,353 --> 00:53:41,152
Everybody in the biz knew.

775
00:53:41,272 --> 00:53:43,551
Nobody knows how you did it.

776
00:53:43,671 --> 00:53:44,830
Hmm?

777
00:53:44,951 --> 00:53:47,270
How'd you do it, Harry?

778
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:48,229
Harry.

779
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,189
Hmm?

780
00:53:49,269 --> 00:53:50,588
10 cents a dance.

781
00:53:50,709 --> 00:53:51,548
Come on.

782
00:53:51,669 --> 00:53:52,548
Ooh.

783
00:53:57,867 --> 00:53:58,986
You all right?

784
00:53:59,107 --> 00:54:00,426
You hurt yourself?

785
00:54:00,546 --> 00:54:02,265
No. Don't worry about my head.

786
00:54:02,386 --> 00:54:04,184
It happens all the time.

787
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:06,584
When I was a little baby...

788
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:09,943
I loved to love to bang my head
up against the wall.

789
00:54:10,063 --> 00:54:13,302
Sometimes I still feel
like doing it. It's comforting.

790
00:54:13,422 --> 00:54:15,220
I tapped my first telephone...

791
00:54:15,341 --> 00:54:17,620
when I was 12 years old...

792
00:54:17,741 --> 00:54:18,860
12 years old.

793
00:54:18,981 --> 00:54:22,219
It was a hallway payphone
where I lived.

794
00:54:22,339 --> 00:54:25,097
For six months,
they didn't know who it was.

795
00:54:25,218 --> 00:54:27,976
My father, he was proud as hell.

796
00:54:28,097 --> 00:54:29,417
He was beaming.

797
00:54:29,537 --> 00:54:30,497
Yeah, boy.

798
00:54:30,617 --> 00:54:33,216
"That Bernie's got a real brain,"
he said.

799
00:54:33,336 --> 00:54:36,055
From then on,
it's been all uphill, Harry.

800
00:54:36,175 --> 00:54:39,973
I got contacts you
wouldn't believe.

801
00:54:40,094 --> 00:54:42,333
Here. Well, bring them over.

802
00:54:45,692 --> 00:54:47,011
Take a cab over.

803
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:49,889
Nothing's sacred
with you, is it, Harry?

804
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:51,809
Sure. The more, the merrier.

805
00:54:51,930 --> 00:54:54,848
We'll be here all night.

806
00:54:54,969 --> 00:54:56,688
Oh! You son of a..

807
00:54:56,809 --> 00:54:59,567
Ha ha ha ha!

808
00:54:59,688 --> 00:55:01,047
What's the matter, Harry?

809
00:55:01,127 --> 00:55:02,966
Can't you take a vacation?

810
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:05,845
When are you getting
a new scrambler, Harry?

811
00:55:05,925 --> 00:55:08,525
This went out
with the Trojan War.

812
00:55:08,645 --> 00:55:11,604
Come on.
I want to hear all about you.

813
00:55:11,684 --> 00:55:13,522
Really obsolete, you know that?

814
00:55:13,603 --> 00:55:15,882
Harry got himself a girlfriend.

815
00:55:16,003 --> 00:55:17,762
Watch out, Harry.

816
00:55:17,882 --> 00:55:19,241
Where are you from?

817
00:55:20,761 --> 00:55:21,600
New York.

818
00:55:21,721 --> 00:55:24,479
I used to live in New York.

819
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,919
First I worked
as a receptionist...

820
00:55:26,999 --> 00:55:29,798
and then I got
promoted to secretary.

821
00:55:29,879 --> 00:55:32,677
And then I was promoted
to gal Friday...

822
00:55:32,758 --> 00:55:35,037
and special assistant
to the boss...

823
00:55:35,156 --> 00:55:36,995
and then I married him.

824
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:56,829
Do you live far from here?

825
00:56:02,788 --> 00:56:05,067
Harry?

826
00:56:05,187 --> 00:56:07,945
Are you still married?

827
00:56:08,066 --> 00:56:09,865
Oh, I don't know.

828
00:56:09,986 --> 00:56:11,305
Probably.

829
00:56:13,345 --> 00:56:15,144
I guess maybe I am.

830
00:56:15,264 --> 00:56:17,463
Last time I heard...

831
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:20,342
Well, he was trying to
scrape up enough money...

832
00:56:20,463 --> 00:56:22,261
to buy another hardware store.

833
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:23,581
Yeah.

834
00:56:23,701 --> 00:56:27,380
And I ended up out here
in San Francisco, unemployed...

835
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,258
which is the entire story
of my life...

836
00:56:30,379 --> 00:56:32,658
up until tonight.

837
00:56:45,894 --> 00:56:48,653
Here's to you. Salute.

838
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:51,532
You don't like me
very much, do you?

839
00:56:51,652 --> 00:56:54,411
You don't want to
talk to me or anything.

840
00:56:54,532 --> 00:56:55,891
I didn't say that.

841
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:10,246
Something is on your mind.

842
00:57:10,367 --> 00:57:12,166
I wish you'd tell me.

843
00:57:12,287 --> 00:57:13,606
I really do.

844
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:16,445
I wish that you'd feel
that you could talk to me...

845
00:57:16,565 --> 00:57:18,844
and that we could be friends.

846
00:57:18,964 --> 00:57:22,523
I mean aside from
all of this junk.

847
00:57:43,756 --> 00:57:45,995
Would you, um...

848
00:57:46,116 --> 00:57:50,034
If you were a girl who'd
waited for someone...

849
00:57:57,352 --> 00:58:00,830
You can trust me.

850
00:58:03,591 --> 00:58:06,349
Well, you never really knew...

851
00:58:06,470 --> 00:58:09,228
when he was going to
come to see you.

852
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:11,628
You just lived in a room alone...

853
00:58:11,748 --> 00:58:13,946
and you knew nothing about him.

854
00:58:14,067 --> 00:58:15,865
And if you loved him...

855
00:58:15,986 --> 00:58:17,785
and were patient with him...

856
00:58:17,906 --> 00:58:20,664
and even though
he didn't dare ever...

857
00:58:20,785 --> 00:58:24,023
tell you anything
about himself personally...

858
00:58:26,064 --> 00:58:28,342
Even though he may
have loved you...

859
00:58:28,462 --> 00:58:30,261
would you...

860
00:58:30,382 --> 00:58:32,661
Would I what?

861
00:58:32,781 --> 00:58:34,101
Would you...

862
00:58:35,661 --> 00:58:38,100
Would you go back to him?

863
00:58:42,858 --> 00:58:44,656
Well, how would I know...

864
00:58:44,777 --> 00:58:47,935
How would I know
that he loved me?

865
00:58:55,334 --> 00:58:58,092
You'd have no way of knowing.

866
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,448
Hey, Harry!

867
00:59:11,569 --> 00:59:14,808
Did you hear the one about
the broad who busted Vegas?

868
00:59:14,928 --> 00:59:16,767
She wore a see-through blouse.

869
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,159
Where are you going?

870
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:44,958
Hey! Hey!

871
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:15,829
You know something, Harry?

872
01:00:15,949 --> 01:00:18,587
12 years ago, I recorded
every telephone call...

873
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:20,507
made by the
presidential nominee...

874
01:00:20,627 --> 01:00:22,426
of a major political party.

875
01:00:22,547 --> 01:00:23,866
I don't want to say which party.

876
01:00:23,987 --> 01:00:26,266
Everywhere he went,
that's where I was.

877
01:00:26,386 --> 01:00:28,064
Coast to coast, I was listening.

878
01:00:28,185 --> 01:00:29,984
I'm not saying I elected...

879
01:00:30,105 --> 01:00:32,463
the president of
the United States...

880
01:00:32,584 --> 01:00:34,782
but you can draw
your own conclusions.

881
01:00:34,903 --> 01:00:37,302
I mean, he lost.

882
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:39,221
Harry, tell them
about the time...

883
01:00:39,342 --> 01:00:41,221
you put the bug
in the parakeet.

884
01:00:41,341 --> 01:00:42,180
Parakeet?

885
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:43,580
No kidding.

886
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,459
Harry one time actually
put a microphone...

887
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:47,899
in a little parakeet.

888
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:49,339
Is that right?

889
01:00:49,459 --> 01:00:51,697
Parakeets don't happen
to be my thing...

890
01:00:51,818 --> 01:00:54,097
but I sure would
like to know...

891
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:56,975
how you did
the teamster local back in '68.

892
01:00:57,096 --> 01:00:58,415
What was that?

893
01:00:58,536 --> 01:01:01,294
Don't you get papers
in Chicago, Millard?

894
01:01:01,415 --> 01:01:02,734
Probably out on strike.

895
01:01:02,854 --> 01:01:05,053
It was all over the front pages.

896
01:01:05,173 --> 01:01:07,452
Harry was working
for the attorney general.

897
01:01:07,573 --> 01:01:10,331
You didn't know I knew, did you?

898
01:01:10,452 --> 01:01:12,731
The president of
this teamster local...

899
01:01:12,851 --> 01:01:15,130
set up a phoney welfare fund.

900
01:01:15,251 --> 01:01:18,489
I mean, you correct me
on the details, Harry.

901
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,888
I may be a little fuzzy.

902
01:01:21,009 --> 01:01:22,807
Only two people seemed to know...

903
01:01:22,928 --> 01:01:24,727
the president and his accountant.

904
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:27,046
They only talked about it
on fishing trips.

905
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,486
On a private boat...

906
01:01:28,607 --> 01:01:30,965
That was the only place
they talked details.

907
01:01:31,085 --> 01:01:33,044
That boat was bug-proof.
That's a fact.

908
01:01:33,165 --> 01:01:35,444
They wouldn't strike up
a conversation...

909
01:01:35,564 --> 01:01:38,323
if there was another boat
on the horizon.

910
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,723
That didn't stop Harry, did it?

911
01:01:40,842 --> 01:01:42,162
No, he recorded everything.

912
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:43,922
Nobody knows
how you did it though.

913
01:01:44,042 --> 01:01:45,840
Caused a hell of a scandal.

914
01:01:45,961 --> 01:01:47,160
Why?

915
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:49,679
No reason.
Three people were murdered.

916
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:53,798
Harry's a bit too modest
to tell us how he did it.

917
01:01:56,518 --> 01:01:58,316
It had nothing to do with me.

918
01:01:58,437 --> 01:02:00,716
I just turned in the tapes.

919
01:02:00,836 --> 01:02:03,075
The president thought
the accountant talked.

920
01:02:03,195 --> 01:02:04,994
Nobody really knows for sure.

921
01:02:05,115 --> 01:02:06,434
Three days later...

922
01:02:06,555 --> 01:02:09,313
they found the accountant,
his wife, and kid...

923
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:12,192
naked and tied up in the house...

924
01:02:12,313 --> 01:02:15,071
Hands and feet
tied up with rope...

925
01:02:15,192 --> 01:02:17,471
all the hair on their bodies
shaved off.

926
01:02:17,591 --> 01:02:19,870
The heads were found
in different places.

927
01:02:19,991 --> 01:02:21,310
They killed them?

928
01:02:21,430 --> 01:02:22,749
No. They gift-wrapped them.

929
01:02:22,870 --> 01:02:24,668
This is ancient history now.

930
01:02:24,789 --> 01:02:26,108
Harry, how'd you do it?

931
01:02:26,228 --> 01:02:29,467
What they do with the tapes
is their business.

932
01:02:29,588 --> 01:02:33,306
Next thing I knew,
you moved out of New York.

933
01:02:33,426 --> 01:02:35,705
It had nothing to do with me.

934
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:38,104
Come on, show and tell.
How'd you do it?

935
01:02:38,225 --> 01:02:40,184
For God's sake, tell him.

936
01:02:44,943 --> 01:02:46,262
Turn it off, Stan.

937
01:02:46,382 --> 01:02:47,541
What for?

938
01:02:47,662 --> 01:02:49,781
Stan, turn it off.

939
01:02:49,901 --> 01:02:51,860
They ought to hear this.

940
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:53,940
It's the best thing
you've ever done.

941
01:02:57,419 --> 01:02:59,617
What was that, Stan?

942
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:05,856
Well, it's the assignment
that Harry did this week.

943
01:03:05,976 --> 01:03:07,295
It'll make history.

944
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:08,735
Yeah?

945
01:03:08,855 --> 01:03:12,093
There's no moment between
human beings that I cannot record...

946
01:03:12,214 --> 01:03:15,613
and there's no method
that I cannot figure out.

947
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:18,491
I could figure out
any of Harry's schemes, right?

948
01:03:18,612 --> 01:03:21,131
Come on, come on. Try me.

949
01:03:21,251 --> 01:03:24,010
Let me give him
the assignment, Harry.

950
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:26,209
Yeah.

951
01:03:31,008 --> 01:03:34,247
This is a quad
in the centre of the city.

952
01:03:34,367 --> 01:03:36,646
These are steps,
benches all around.

953
01:03:36,767 --> 01:03:38,086
It's 12:00 noon...

954
01:03:38,206 --> 01:03:40,004
which means
that it's lunchtime...

955
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:42,883
for the people working
in these offices.

956
01:03:43,004 --> 01:03:44,803
They're walking, talking,
having lunch...

957
01:03:44,924 --> 01:03:46,243
and it's crowded.

958
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:47,683
Naturally. Come on, Stan.

959
01:03:47,803 --> 01:03:50,561
Okay. Two people are constantly
moving in circles...

960
01:03:50,682 --> 01:03:52,480
in and out of the crowd.

961
01:03:52,601 --> 01:03:55,080
We don't know whether
they'll sit down or what.

962
01:03:55,161 --> 01:03:57,280
They're convinced
they can't be recorded...

963
01:03:57,400 --> 01:04:00,638
because they're in a crowd
and constantly moving.

964
01:04:00,759 --> 01:04:02,078
Yet, they're the target.

965
01:04:02,198 --> 01:04:04,397
The assignment is
to get everything they say.

966
01:04:04,517 --> 01:04:06,397
How would you do it?

967
01:04:06,517 --> 01:04:08,316
One system won't do it.

968
01:04:08,437 --> 01:04:10,235
I could've told you that.

969
01:04:10,356 --> 01:04:11,675
Why didn't you?

970
01:04:11,795 --> 01:04:13,594
Go on, figure it out.

971
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:15,434
You get to their clothes first.

972
01:04:15,554 --> 01:04:16,874
You pre-rig their clothes.

973
01:04:16,994 --> 01:04:18,793
There's no way of telling...

974
01:04:18,914 --> 01:04:20,153
what they're
going to be wearing.

975
01:04:20,273 --> 01:04:22,552
Get somebody to bump into them.

976
01:04:22,672 --> 01:04:25,830
Get a drunk to plant
a pin mike on them.

977
01:04:25,951 --> 01:04:28,030
They've been bugged before.
It's too risky.

978
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:29,350
I got it.

979
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:33,189
You hire a lip-reader
with binoculars.

980
01:04:33,309 --> 01:04:36,068
No. The client wants
their actual voice.

981
01:04:36,188 --> 01:04:37,987
Why?

982
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:39,827
So he can believe it.

983
01:04:39,947 --> 01:04:42,226
All right. I'll figure it out.

984
01:04:42,346 --> 01:04:45,185
I don't know.
It must've been an expensive show.

985
01:04:45,305 --> 01:04:46,624
Who was so interested?

986
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:48,064
Yeah, was it us?

987
01:04:48,184 --> 01:04:49,023
Who's us?

988
01:04:49,144 --> 01:04:49,983
Federal government.

989
01:04:50,104 --> 01:04:50,943
Private party.

990
01:04:51,063 --> 01:04:53,822
It would take
at least four passes.

991
01:04:53,942 --> 01:04:55,741
I did it in three.

992
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:58,620
Three? That's very nice.
What did you use?

993
01:04:58,741 --> 01:05:00,060
Three-stage directional
microphones...

994
01:05:00,181 --> 01:05:02,939
with Mosfet amplifier
of my own design.

995
01:05:03,060 --> 01:05:05,818
We got another 20% conventionally
just tailing them.

996
01:05:05,939 --> 01:05:06,778
Paul did.

997
01:05:06,899 --> 01:05:09,578
It was beautiful.
It really was.

998
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:11,976
It was a work of art.

999
01:05:12,097 --> 01:05:14,376
You should have
seen it, though.

1000
01:05:14,496 --> 01:05:15,895
These new microphones
are just incredible.

1001
01:05:16,016 --> 01:05:17,735
I couldn't believe it myself.

1002
01:05:17,855 --> 01:05:19,654
We were 200 yards away.

1003
01:05:19,775 --> 01:05:21,094
It was absolutely readable.

1004
01:05:21,214 --> 01:05:23,253
I broke in a couple
of newsreel cameramen.

1005
01:05:23,373 --> 01:05:24,692
You should have
been there, Bernie.

1006
01:05:24,813 --> 01:05:26,052
What did they do?

1007
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,371
They took the cross hairs
of the telescope...

1008
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:30,771
and lined it up on the mouths...

1009
01:05:30,891 --> 01:05:33,650
No. The boy and the girl.
What did they do?

1010
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:35,090
Oh, I don't know.

1011
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:37,488
But it was beautiful,
something to see.

1012
01:05:37,609 --> 01:05:38,928
Yeah. Sounds very pretty.

1013
01:05:39,048 --> 01:05:41,807
I'd like to take
a look at that mike, too.

1014
01:05:41,927 --> 01:05:43,247
There it is.

1015
01:05:43,367 --> 01:05:44,687
Oh.

1016
01:05:44,807 --> 01:05:47,805
I always said
we should be partners, Harry.

1017
01:05:47,925 --> 01:05:51,404
You're the best, but you
and me together, that'd be tops.

1018
01:05:51,524 --> 01:05:55,163
I need a quick look at
your plans and devices.

1019
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,123
I got all the
manufacturing plants.

1020
01:05:57,242 --> 01:05:59,961
We could make a fortune
selling to Uncle Sam.

1021
01:06:00,082 --> 01:06:02,840
Did you hear about
the fag wiretapper...

1022
01:06:02,961 --> 01:06:05,720
who could only tap
a Princess phone?

1023
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:06,719
No.

1024
01:06:10,159 --> 01:06:11,957
Made that up yourself, huh?

1025
01:06:12,078 --> 01:06:14,357
It's pretty funny.

1026
01:06:14,478 --> 01:06:15,797
Can I cut in?

1027
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:18,675
He's got a hell
of a sense of humour.

1028
01:06:18,796 --> 01:06:20,594
I'm talking about
making millions...

1029
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:22,514
he's making with the jokes.

1030
01:06:22,635 --> 01:06:23,474
Come on!

1031
01:06:23,594 --> 01:06:24,914
Thanks a lot.

1032
01:06:25,034 --> 01:06:26,833
What do you say, Harry?

1033
01:06:26,954 --> 01:06:29,233
How about going
into a partnership?

1034
01:06:29,353 --> 01:06:32,111
I could use a partner,
so could you.

1035
01:06:32,232 --> 01:06:33,551
50-50, how about it?

1036
01:06:33,672 --> 01:06:35,311
I don't need anyone.

1037
01:06:35,431 --> 01:06:36,750
That's all right.

1038
01:06:36,870 --> 01:06:39,628
I do pretty good
on my own, anyway.

1039
01:06:39,749 --> 01:06:42,988
You got to give credit
where credit's due, right?

1040
01:06:43,109 --> 01:06:43,947
Abracadabra, Harry.

1041
01:06:44,068 --> 01:06:45,867
See, I'm number two, Harry.

1042
01:06:45,988 --> 01:06:47,786
I have to try harder.

1043
01:06:47,907 --> 01:06:50,786
Would you, um...
If you were a girl...

1044
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:52,225
who'd waited for someone...

1045
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:53,665
You can trust me.

1046
01:06:53,785 --> 01:06:57,024
Harry, that's you and me
when we were out there.

1047
01:06:57,144 --> 01:06:58,943
What? No shit. Ha ha ha.

1048
01:06:59,064 --> 01:07:02,303
It's the Moran Super P-7
pen mike and transmitter.

1049
01:07:02,422 --> 01:07:03,541
That's terrific!

1050
01:07:03,662 --> 01:07:05,461
The bugger got bugged, huh?

1051
01:07:05,581 --> 01:07:06,901
He got you, Harry.

1052
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:09,780
And if you loved him
and were patient with him...

1053
01:07:09,901 --> 01:07:12,859
and even though
he didn't dare ever...

1054
01:07:12,979 --> 01:07:16,017
tell you anything about
himself personally...

1055
01:07:16,138 --> 01:07:17,457
Hey, touch, Harry.

1056
01:07:17,578 --> 01:07:19,857
That's wild.
When did you do that?

1057
01:07:19,977 --> 01:07:23,695
How do you like it?
What do you think?

1058
01:07:23,816 --> 01:07:28,574
Would you...
Would you go back to him?

1059
01:07:28,694 --> 01:07:31,652
I think you better
turn it off and get out.

1060
01:07:31,773 --> 01:07:35,491
Are you kidding? It's just
a joke, for Christ's sakes.

1061
01:07:35,612 --> 01:07:38,851
Bernie, Harry don't like you
to say "Christ's sakes."

1062
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:42,170
Well, I'm sorry, Harry.
Are you crazy, too, Stanley?

1063
01:07:42,290 --> 01:07:43,129
What's wrong?

1064
01:07:43,249 --> 01:07:45,048
Let's have a party here.

1065
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:46,488
Paul, it's getting late.

1066
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:48,248
Come on, take it easy.

1067
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:49,207
Come on.

1068
01:07:49,328 --> 01:07:50,167
Hey, Millard.

1069
01:07:50,288 --> 01:07:52,086
Know what these things cost?

1070
01:07:52,207 --> 01:07:53,526
This cost 1.500 beans.

1071
01:07:53,646 --> 01:07:55,445
On the house, from me to you.

1072
01:07:57,965 --> 01:07:59,844
Very nice to meet you.

1073
01:08:01,764 --> 01:08:03,162
It's only a joke.

1074
01:08:03,283 --> 01:08:04,602
Meredith?

1075
01:08:04,723 --> 01:08:06,043
He's got no sense of humour.

1076
01:08:06,162 --> 01:08:08,441
No. I'm going to stay here.

1077
01:08:08,562 --> 01:08:09,441
Paul!

1078
01:08:10,961 --> 01:08:12,160
Okay.

1079
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,799
I forgot my bag.

1080
01:08:18,959 --> 01:08:20,278
Harry, I'm really sorry.

1081
01:08:20,398 --> 01:08:21,877
I didn't mean anything.

1082
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:23,317
Come on, Stan.

1083
01:08:23,437 --> 01:08:25,236
See you Monday, Harry.

1084
01:08:25,356 --> 01:08:28,195
You want us to
put the lights out?

1085
01:08:46,430 --> 01:08:47,269
Night, Harry!

1086
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,669
Yeah. Goodnight, Harry.

1087
01:08:54,427 --> 01:08:55,747
What do you think?

1088
01:08:55,867 --> 01:08:58,626
I don't know what
I'm going to get him...

1089
01:08:58,746 --> 01:08:59,745
for Christmas yet.

1090
01:08:59,866 --> 01:09:01,185
He's already got everything.

1091
01:09:07,064 --> 01:09:10,781
Harry, are you going to give me
a hard time tonight?

1092
01:09:10,902 --> 01:09:12,301
# When the red,
red robin #

1093
01:09:12,422 --> 01:09:13,741
Harry!

1094
01:09:13,861 --> 01:09:15,100
Harry!

1095
01:09:15,221 --> 01:09:16,541
Come on. Come back.

1096
01:09:16,661 --> 01:09:18,459
Turn it off.

1097
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,378
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1098
01:09:20,499 --> 01:09:21,498
# When the red, red robin #

1099
01:09:21,619 --> 01:09:26,937
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1100
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:31,416
# Wake up, wake up,
you sleepyhead #

1101
01:09:31,536 --> 01:09:33,016
She's frightened.

1102
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,775
This is where she's frightened.

1103
01:09:34,895 --> 01:09:37,174
I don't know what
I'm going to get him...

1104
01:09:37,295 --> 01:09:38,614
for Christmas yet.

1105
01:09:38,734 --> 01:09:40,213
This is no ordinary conversation.

1106
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:42,131
He doesn't need anything any more.

1107
01:09:42,252 --> 01:09:43,811
It makes me feel...

1108
01:09:43,932 --> 01:09:47,650
I haven't decided
what I'm going to get you yet.

1109
01:09:47,771 --> 01:09:48,610
Something.

1110
01:09:48,730 --> 01:09:50,050
Forget it, Harry.

1111
01:09:50,170 --> 01:09:51,490
It's only a trick.

1112
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:52,929
What?

1113
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:53,929
A job.

1114
01:09:54,049 --> 01:09:56,287
You're not supposed
to feel anything.

1115
01:09:56,408 --> 01:09:58,687
You're just supposed to do it.

1116
01:09:58,808 --> 01:10:00,127
That's all.

1117
01:10:00,247 --> 01:10:01,086
Relax, honey.

1118
01:10:01,206 --> 01:10:03,485
A lot of fun you are.

1119
01:10:03,606 --> 01:10:04,925
You're supposed to tease me...

1120
01:10:05,045 --> 01:10:06,844
give me hints, make me guess.

1121
01:10:06,965 --> 01:10:07,804
You know.

1122
01:10:08,884 --> 01:10:10,203
Does it bother you?

1123
01:10:10,324 --> 01:10:11,163
What?

1124
01:10:11,284 --> 01:10:13,082
Walking around in circles.

1125
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:19,320
Oh, look, that's terrible.

1126
01:10:19,441 --> 01:10:21,239
He's not hurting anyone.

1127
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:26,039
Neither are we.

1128
01:10:29,518 --> 01:10:30,357
Oh, God.

1129
01:10:30,478 --> 01:10:31,317
"Oh, God."

1130
01:10:31,438 --> 01:10:34,676
Listen to the way
she says "Oh, God."

1131
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:37,714
Come here.

1132
01:10:37,835 --> 01:10:40,354
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

1133
01:10:40,475 --> 01:10:43,233
I always think the same thing.

1134
01:10:43,354 --> 01:10:45,152
What do you think?

1135
01:10:45,273 --> 01:10:46,592
I always think...

1136
01:10:46,712 --> 01:10:49,511
that he was once
somebody's baby boy.

1137
01:10:51,511 --> 01:10:53,110
Really. I... I do.

1138
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:55,989
I think he was once
somebody's baby boy...

1139
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:59,828
and he had a mother
and a father who loved him.

1140
01:10:59,949 --> 01:11:03,667
And now there he is,
half dead on a park bench...

1141
01:11:03,787 --> 01:11:06,066
and where are his
mother or his father...

1142
01:11:06,186 --> 01:11:07,985
all his uncles now?

1143
01:11:08,106 --> 01:11:10,384
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

1144
01:11:12,624 --> 01:11:13,943
I always think...

1145
01:11:14,064 --> 01:11:16,343
how, when they had
the newspaper strike...

1146
01:11:16,463 --> 01:11:17,302
in New York...

1147
01:11:17,423 --> 01:11:19,221
more of those old guys died.

1148
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:21,621
50 of them froze
to death in one night.

1149
01:11:21,742 --> 01:11:24,021
Just because there were
no newspapers?

1150
01:11:24,140 --> 01:11:26,419
Really. Keeps them warm.

1151
01:11:26,540 --> 01:11:28,379
Well, that's terrible.

1152
01:11:29,899 --> 01:11:31,938
Who started this
conversation, anyhow?

1153
01:11:34,218 --> 01:11:35,537
You did.

1154
01:11:35,657 --> 01:11:36,976
Did not.

1155
01:11:37,097 --> 01:11:38,376
Yes, you did.

1156
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:40,416
You just don't remember it.

1157
01:11:41,855 --> 01:11:44,613
Pretend like I just
told you a joke.

1158
01:11:48,094 --> 01:11:49,892
Where did you hear that?

1159
01:11:50,013 --> 01:11:51,332
That's my secret.

1160
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,650
Later in the week.

1161
01:11:55,771 --> 01:11:56,610
Sunday, maybe.

1162
01:11:58,650 --> 01:12:00,449
Sunday, definitely.

1163
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,288
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1164
01:12:06,328 --> 01:12:08,607
3:00. Room 773.

1165
01:12:08,727 --> 01:12:10,925
Look, Mark. Do you see him?

1166
01:12:11,046 --> 01:12:12,845
The man with the hearing aid
like Charles.

1167
01:12:12,965 --> 01:12:14,124
No. Where?

1168
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:17,004
Right there,
with the shopping bag.

1169
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:18,923
He's been following us
all around...

1170
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:21,083
and he's following us close.

1171
01:12:21,203 --> 01:12:23,961
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1172
01:12:26,482 --> 01:12:28,280
# When the red, red robin #

1173
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:31,159
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1174
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,119
# Along #

1175
01:12:32,240 --> 01:12:33,079
Angel...

1176
01:12:34,639 --> 01:12:36,358
God, it will be so good...

1177
01:12:36,478 --> 01:12:39,237
to be finished with all this.

1178
01:12:39,358 --> 01:12:40,717
I love you.

1179
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:43,076
It's all right, baby.

1180
01:12:43,196 --> 01:12:44,475
It's all right.

1181
01:12:44,596 --> 01:12:46,395
We're spending too much
time together here.

1182
01:12:46,516 --> 01:12:49,274
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

1183
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:54,152
"Kill us."

1184
01:12:55,192 --> 01:12:57,950
He'd kill them
if he had a chance.

1185
01:12:58,071 --> 01:13:00,470
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1186
01:13:00,591 --> 01:13:02,389
Oh, God. What have I done?

1187
01:13:02,510 --> 01:13:05,268
I have to destroy the tapes.

1188
01:13:05,389 --> 01:13:08,148
I can't let it happen again.

1189
01:13:08,268 --> 01:13:11,027
I better get back.
It's almost 2:00.

1190
01:13:11,147 --> 01:13:12,347
Oh, please, don't go.

1191
01:13:12,467 --> 01:13:15,425
A family was murdered
because of me.

1192
01:13:16,786 --> 01:13:17,665
I know.

1193
01:13:18,705 --> 01:13:20,024
I know, Harry.

1194
01:13:20,144 --> 01:13:21,504
Everything will turn out.

1195
01:13:23,023 --> 01:13:25,782
Oh, God. There's no protection.

1196
01:13:25,903 --> 01:13:28,181
I follow them
wherever they're going.

1197
01:13:28,302 --> 01:13:29,621
And I can hear them.

1198
01:13:29,741 --> 01:13:30,900
Bye-bye.

1199
01:13:31,021 --> 01:13:32,941
Oh, wait, you have
something in your eye.

1200
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:33,899
Yeah?

1201
01:13:34,020 --> 01:13:35,339
You really don't.

1202
01:13:35,460 --> 01:13:37,739
I just wanted to kiss you.

1203
01:13:37,859 --> 01:13:39,178
I forgive you.

1204
01:13:39,299 --> 01:13:40,618
I forgive you, darling.

1205
01:13:40,738 --> 01:13:42,977
I forgive you.

1206
01:15:09,351 --> 01:15:10,190
Listen.

1207
01:15:10,310 --> 01:15:12,949
Listen. My name is Harry Caul.

1208
01:15:14,789 --> 01:15:16,268
Can you hear me?

1209
01:15:18,148 --> 01:15:20,107
Don't be afraid.

1210
01:15:20,228 --> 01:15:23,946
I... I know you don't
know who I am...

1211
01:15:24,066 --> 01:15:25,386
but I know you.

1212
01:15:26,946 --> 01:15:29,464
There isn't much
to say about myself.

1213
01:15:29,584 --> 01:15:30,423
I...

1214
01:15:40,141 --> 01:15:42,219
Sick when I was a boy.

1215
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,739
I was very sick
when I was a boy.

1216
01:15:46,859 --> 01:15:50,577
I was paralyzed in my left arm
and my left leg.

1217
01:15:50,697 --> 01:15:52,337
I couldn't walk for six months.

1218
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:55,696
One doctor said that
I'd probably never walk again.

1219
01:15:58,375 --> 01:16:00,014
My mother...

1220
01:16:00,135 --> 01:16:02,894
My mother used to
lower me into a hot bath.

1221
01:16:03,014 --> 01:16:04,813
It was therapy.

1222
01:16:06,373 --> 01:16:07,532
One time the doorbell rang...

1223
01:16:07,653 --> 01:16:09,932
and she went down to answer it.

1224
01:16:10,051 --> 01:16:11,211
I started sliding down.

1225
01:16:11,331 --> 01:16:12,651
I could feel the water.

1226
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:15,529
It started coming up
to my chin, to my nose.

1227
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:16,969
When I woke up...

1228
01:16:17,090 --> 01:16:19,848
my body was all greasy
from the holy oil...

1229
01:16:19,969 --> 01:16:21,767
she put on my body.

1230
01:16:21,888 --> 01:16:24,167
I remember being
disappointed I survived.

1231
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:25,446
When I was 5...

1232
01:16:25,567 --> 01:16:28,245
my... my father introduced me
to a friend of his.

1233
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:31,125
For no reason,
I hit him in the stomach.

1234
01:16:31,245 --> 01:16:33,044
He died a year later.

1235
01:16:34,164 --> 01:16:36,922
He'll kill you
if he gets a chance.

1236
01:16:40,043 --> 01:16:42,602
I'm not afraid of death.

1237
01:16:49,159 --> 01:16:51,358
I am afraid of murder.

1238
01:17:47,182 --> 01:17:48,020
Meredith?

1239
01:17:52,459 --> 01:17:53,298
Hey.

1240
01:18:36,326 --> 01:18:37,165
Bitch.

1241
01:18:53,801 --> 01:18:56,080
Good morning. May I help you?

1242
01:18:56,200 --> 01:18:57,520
Yes. Extension 765, please.

1243
01:18:57,639 --> 01:18:58,999
One moment, please.

1244
01:19:00,519 --> 01:19:01,718
Director's office.

1245
01:19:01,838 --> 01:19:05,036
I'd like to speak to
the director's assistant, please.

1246
01:19:05,157 --> 01:19:07,116
Mr Stett. Uh, Mr Martin Stett.

1247
01:19:07,236 --> 01:19:09,035
Mr Caul is on the line.

1248
01:19:09,156 --> 01:19:10,515
One moment, please.

1249
01:19:13,475 --> 01:19:15,274
I'm sorry. That's impossible now.

1250
01:19:15,394 --> 01:19:17,193
Can we get back to you?

1251
01:19:17,314 --> 01:19:19,552
No, I... I... I have
to talk to him.

1252
01:19:19,672 --> 01:19:21,471
Can we have your name again?

1253
01:19:21,592 --> 01:19:22,431
Caul.

1254
01:19:22,551 --> 01:19:24,830
Would you mind spelling that?

1255
01:19:24,951 --> 01:19:27,230
C-A-U-L. Caul.

1256
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:29,148
I'm putting you on hold.

1257
01:19:32,629 --> 01:19:34,908
Mr Caul, we'll get
right back to you.

1258
01:19:35,027 --> 01:19:37,306
No. You don't have
my telephone number.

1259
01:19:37,427 --> 01:19:38,266
Hello?

1260
01:20:30,131 --> 01:20:30,970
Yes?

1261
01:20:31,091 --> 01:20:32,889
Mr Caul? This is Martin Stett.

1262
01:20:33,010 --> 01:20:34,809
How did you get this number?

1263
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,728
We prepare dossiers
on everyone...

1264
01:20:36,849 --> 01:20:39,128
who comes in contact
with the director.

1265
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:41,527
You know that means
we've been watching you.

1266
01:20:41,647 --> 01:20:42,967
We have the tapes.

1267
01:20:43,087 --> 01:20:44,406
They're perfectly safe.

1268
01:20:44,527 --> 01:20:48,245
The director was anxious
to hear them as soon as possible.

1269
01:20:48,365 --> 01:20:50,644
You seemed to be...
I don't know... disturbed.

1270
01:20:50,764 --> 01:20:53,522
I couldn't risk
you destroying our tapes.

1271
01:20:53,643 --> 01:20:55,922
You understand,
don't you, Mr Caul?

1272
01:20:56,043 --> 01:20:59,602
Our tapes have nothing
to do with you.

1273
01:20:59,722 --> 01:21:01,520
Why don't you come over now...

1274
01:21:01,641 --> 01:21:02,960
and bring the photographs?

1275
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,319
The director's here...

1276
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:06,719
and he's prepared
to pay you in full.

1277
01:22:24,295 --> 01:22:27,534
Every time I see
one of those old guys...

1278
01:22:27,654 --> 01:22:28,973
I think the same thing.

1279
01:22:30,533 --> 01:22:32,331
What do you think?

1280
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:36,330
I always think that he
was once somebody's baby boy.

1281
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:39,889
Really. I... I do.

1282
01:22:40,010 --> 01:22:42,569
He was once somebody's
baby boy...

1283
01:22:42,649 --> 01:22:46,048
and he had a mother
and father who loved him...

1284
01:22:46,168 --> 01:22:47,487
and now, there he is...

1285
01:22:47,608 --> 01:22:49,567
half dead on a park bench.

1286
01:22:49,687 --> 01:22:51,966
And where are his mother
or his father...

1287
01:22:52,086 --> 01:22:53,525
all his uncles now?

1288
01:22:54,965 --> 01:22:57,644
Anyway, that's what
I always think.

1289
01:22:59,444 --> 01:23:00,764
I always think...

1290
01:23:00,884 --> 01:23:03,642
how, when they had
the newspaper strike in New York...

1291
01:23:03,763 --> 01:23:05,322
more of those old guys died.

1292
01:23:05,442 --> 01:23:08,201
50 of them froze to death
in one night.

1293
01:23:08,321 --> 01:23:10,520
Just because there were
no newspapers?

1294
01:23:10,641 --> 01:23:12,719
Really. Keeps them warm.

1295
01:23:12,840 --> 01:23:14,679
Sounds terrible.

1296
01:23:15,879 --> 01:23:19,078
Who started this
conversation anyhow?

1297
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:21,837
You did.

1298
01:23:21,957 --> 01:23:23,796
Did not.

1299
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:26,675
Yes, you did.
You just don't remember it.

1300
01:23:27,915 --> 01:23:30,674
Oh, Mark, it's all right.
We can talk.

1301
01:23:30,794 --> 01:23:32,593
I can't stand it.

1302
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:34,672
I can't stand it any more.

1303
01:23:34,793 --> 01:23:37,312
You're going to make me cry.

1304
01:23:38,512 --> 01:23:41,271
I know, honey, I know. Me, too.

1305
01:23:41,391 --> 01:23:42,230
No, don't.

1306
01:23:42,351 --> 01:23:43,190
Oh, God.

1307
01:23:43,311 --> 01:23:45,230
You want to hear that again?

1308
01:23:45,350 --> 01:23:47,629
You want it to be true!

1309
01:23:47,749 --> 01:23:49,388
No, I don't.

1310
01:23:49,508 --> 01:23:51,307
I just want you to know...

1311
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:52,866
whatever you need to know.

1312
01:23:52,987 --> 01:23:54,106
That's all.

1313
01:23:54,227 --> 01:23:56,186
Your money's on the table.

1314
01:23:58,186 --> 01:24:00,984
Do you think we can do this?

1315
01:24:02,225 --> 01:24:04,504
I'm tired of drinking anyhow.

1316
01:24:05,903 --> 01:24:07,902
I'm tired of mostly everything.

1317
01:24:08,022 --> 01:24:09,342
Tired of me?

1318
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:10,782
Tired of you...

1319
01:24:10,901 --> 01:24:12,340
but not today.

1320
01:24:13,661 --> 01:24:15,100
Later in the week.

1321
01:24:15,221 --> 01:24:17,380
Sunday, maybe.

1322
01:24:19,739 --> 01:24:21,858
Sunday, definitely.

1323
01:24:26,937 --> 01:24:29,376
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1324
01:24:29,496 --> 01:24:30,335
3:00.

1325
01:24:30,456 --> 01:24:33,055
Room 773.

1326
01:24:33,175 --> 01:24:35,454
Look, Mark, do you see him...

1327
01:24:35,575 --> 01:24:37,854
the man with the hearing aid
like Charles?

1328
01:24:37,973 --> 01:24:38,893
No. Where?

1329
01:24:39,013 --> 01:24:42,012
Right there, with
the shopping bag.

1330
01:24:42,132 --> 01:24:44,211
Please count your money outside.

1331
01:24:44,332 --> 01:24:46,611
He's been following us all around.

1332
01:24:46,730 --> 01:24:48,929
He was following us close.

1333
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,528
It's nothing.
Don't worry about it.

1334
01:24:56,847 --> 01:24:58,366
# When the red, red robin #

1335
01:24:58,487 --> 01:25:01,885
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1336
01:25:02,006 --> 01:25:03,045
# Along #

1337
01:25:05,165 --> 01:25:07,444
God, it will be so good...

1338
01:25:07,564 --> 01:25:09,843
to be finished with all this.

1339
01:25:12,362 --> 01:25:13,722
I love you.

1340
01:25:16,921 --> 01:25:19,680
These are the pictures
you asked for.

1341
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:22,120
We're spending
too much time together here.

1342
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:24,518
No. Let's stay
just a little longer.

1343
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:26,638
What will you do to her?

1344
01:25:26,758 --> 01:25:29,197
...kill us if he got the chance.

1345
01:25:32,037 --> 01:25:34,835
I think he's been
recording my telephone.

1346
01:25:36,835 --> 01:25:39,634
Listen, I'd better get back.
It's almost 2:00.

1347
01:25:39,754 --> 01:25:41,552
No, please don't go back there.

1348
01:25:41,673 --> 01:25:43,392
Not just yet.

1349
01:25:43,513 --> 01:25:47,591
All right.
All right, honey. I won't.

1350
01:25:51,550 --> 01:25:52,869
15.000 bucks.

1351
01:25:52,990 --> 01:25:57,069
That's not bad for a day's work,
is it, Mr Caul?

1352
01:25:57,188 --> 01:25:59,187
What'll he do with them?

1353
01:26:01,508 --> 01:26:02,507
We'll see.

1354
01:26:11,304 --> 01:26:14,983
...kill us if he got the chance.

1355
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:17,062
# When the red, red robin #

1356
01:26:17,183 --> 01:26:20,462
# Goes bob, bob, bobbin' along #

1357
01:26:20,582 --> 01:26:21,701
# Along #

1358
01:26:24,740 --> 01:26:28,698
Later in the week.
Sunday, maybe.

1359
01:26:31,338 --> 01:26:33,136
Sunday, definitely.

1360
01:26:36,296 --> 01:26:37,896
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1361
01:26:39,376 --> 01:26:41,295
3:00.

1362
01:26:41,415 --> 01:26:43,335
Room 773.

1363
01:26:45,333 --> 01:26:46,452
Uh...

1364
01:26:46,573 --> 01:26:50,212
I wonder if you could give me
room 773.

1365
01:26:50,332 --> 01:26:52,291
773?

1366
01:26:53,611 --> 01:26:55,490
That is occupied, sir.

1367
01:26:58,730 --> 01:27:01,488
The rooms are all
basically the same, however.

1368
01:27:01,609 --> 01:27:02,529
Well...

1369
01:27:05,647 --> 01:27:08,406
Do you have a room
that would be, uh...

1370
01:27:08,526 --> 01:27:09,846
adjoining, uh... close by?

1371
01:27:09,966 --> 01:27:11,566
Adjoining, just...

1372
01:27:11,685 --> 01:27:13,364
Yes, I do.

1373
01:27:13,485 --> 01:27:14,364
You do.

1374
01:31:15,090 --> 01:31:17,809
I'm tired of this lying,
all right?

1375
01:31:27,446 --> 01:31:29,405
I can't stand it.

1376
01:31:29,525 --> 01:31:31,724
I can't stand it any more.

1377
01:31:31,845 --> 01:31:34,124
You're going to make me cry.

1378
01:31:34,243 --> 01:31:36,882
I know. Me, too.

1379
01:31:37,003 --> 01:31:38,202
No, don't.

1380
01:31:38,322 --> 01:31:40,241
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1381
01:31:40,362 --> 01:31:41,881
No idea!

1382
01:31:42,002 --> 01:31:43,800
This is horrible...

1383
01:31:46,999 --> 01:31:48,319
I love you.

1384
01:32:37,944 --> 01:32:41,262
Aah!

1385
01:32:43,062 --> 01:32:45,781
Aah!

1386
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:54,458
It was stated that Nixon
would not deliver...

1387
01:32:54,578 --> 01:32:57,257
the State of the Union
message in person...

1388
01:33:07,734 --> 01:33:09,893
Will you cut that out?

1389
01:33:10,014 --> 01:33:12,772
How can you yell
at me like that?

1390
01:33:12,893 --> 01:33:14,212
And in my condition.

1391
01:33:14,332 --> 01:33:17,571
You're not fit to be
the father of my child.

1392
01:33:17,692 --> 01:33:19,011
Oh, what is this?

1393
01:33:19,131 --> 01:33:20,929
I'm trying to act like Wilma.

1394
01:33:21,050 --> 01:33:22,649
Well, you're overdoing it.

1395
01:33:26,808 --> 01:33:28,487
All right. Pull over.

1396
01:33:30,608 --> 01:33:32,047
What's the big rush?

1397
01:33:32,167 --> 01:33:34,285
I'm taking my wife
to the hospital.

1398
01:33:34,406 --> 01:33:35,726
She's having a baby.

1399
01:33:35,845 --> 01:33:37,485
I got to hand it to you.

1400
01:33:37,606 --> 01:33:38,844
You got intestinal fortitude.

1401
01:33:38,965 --> 01:33:39,925
Sit down, Fred.

1402
01:33:40,045 --> 01:33:43,643
You're wearing a groove
in the floor.

1403
01:33:43,764 --> 01:33:45,083
Look at Wilma out there.

1404
01:33:45,203 --> 01:33:47,001
How can she be so calm...

1405
01:33:47,122 --> 01:33:49,880
when she knows
what I'm going through?

1406
01:33:50,001 --> 01:33:51,320
How are you, Fred?

1407
01:33:51,441 --> 01:33:53,720
How do you think I am?

1408
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,639
Betty, you go out there...

1409
01:33:55,759 --> 01:33:57,918
and tell Wilma if she doesn't...

1410
01:38:06,681 --> 01:38:07,720
Wait. Richard!

1411
01:38:07,801 --> 01:38:09,520
I want to see the director.

1412
01:38:09,641 --> 01:38:11,159
He's not in today.

1413
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:14,639
I'm afraid you'll
have to leave now.

1414
01:40:08,364 --> 01:40:09,683
Let's clear an aisle.

1415
01:40:09,803 --> 01:40:11,122
Let these people through.

1416
01:40:11,243 --> 01:40:12,562
Come on, clear the way.

1417
01:40:12,682 --> 01:40:14,001
We'll answer your
questions upstairs.

1418
01:40:14,122 --> 01:40:15,441
Let these people through.

1419
01:40:15,561 --> 01:40:17,000
Let these people through.

1420
01:40:17,121 --> 01:40:18,359
Just one question.

1421
01:40:18,480 --> 01:40:19,440
No, please.

1422
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,078
Do you suspect foul play
in the accident?

1423
01:40:22,199 --> 01:40:23,958
What about your
corporate control?

1424
01:40:24,078 --> 01:40:25,877
Will your stock now give you...

1425
01:40:25,998 --> 01:40:26,837
controlling interest?

1426
01:40:26,957 --> 01:40:29,476
What kind of insurance
do you have?

1427
01:40:29,597 --> 01:40:30,756
That's an unfair question.

1428
01:40:35,355 --> 01:40:37,154
What do you think?

1429
01:40:37,274 --> 01:40:40,033
I don't know what
I'm getting him for Christmas.

1430
01:40:40,153 --> 01:40:42,432
He's already got everything.

1431
01:40:42,552 --> 01:40:45,391
Doesn't need anything any more.

1432
01:40:48,151 --> 01:40:51,070
Do you feel there's an enemy
within the company?

1433
01:40:53,790 --> 01:40:55,588
He's not hurting anybody.

1434
01:40:55,709 --> 01:40:58,268
Neither are we.

1435
01:40:58,388 --> 01:41:00,626
Oh, God.

1436
01:41:00,747 --> 01:41:01,586
...drunk driving?

1437
01:41:06,145 --> 01:41:07,384
I can't stand it.

1438
01:41:07,504 --> 01:41:10,423
I can't stand it any more.

1439
01:41:10,544 --> 01:41:11,583
Aah!

1440
01:41:13,623 --> 01:41:14,543
Take it!

1441
01:41:14,662 --> 01:41:16,262
Take it!

1442
01:41:21,181 --> 01:41:23,420
Do you think we can do this?

1443
01:41:23,540 --> 01:41:25,379
Later in the week.

1444
01:41:25,499 --> 01:41:28,218
Sunday, maybe.

1445
01:41:28,339 --> 01:41:31,097
Sunday, definitely.

1446
01:41:31,218 --> 01:41:32,937
The Jack Tar Hotel.

1447
01:41:34,217 --> 01:41:35,056
3:00.

1448
01:41:35,177 --> 01:41:37,135
Room 773.

1449
01:41:40,414 --> 01:41:43,213
He'd kill us if he got the chance.

1450
01:42:15,124 --> 01:42:16,323
Hello.

1451
01:42:18,003 --> 01:42:19,202
Hello.

1452
01:43:10,786 --> 01:43:12,065
Hello.

1453
01:43:19,304 --> 01:43:20,383
Hello.

1454
01:43:20,504 --> 01:43:23,103
We know that you know, Mr Caul.

1455
01:43:23,223 --> 01:43:25,981
For your own sake,
don't get involved any further.

1456
01:43:26,102 --> 01:43:27,901
We'll be listening to you.
