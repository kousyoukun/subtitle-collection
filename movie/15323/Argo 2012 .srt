1
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,790
This is the Persian Empire

2
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:44,270
known today as Iran.

3
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:49,320
For 2,500 years, this land
was ruled by a series of kings

4
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:51,590
known as "Shahs".

5
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,820
In 1950, the people of Iran
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh

6
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:00,000
a secular democrat, as prime minister.

7
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:03,800
He nationalized British and US
petroleum holdings,

8
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,740
returning Iran's oil to its people.

9
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,000
But in 1953,

10
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,890
the US and Great Britain
engineered a coup d'etat

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,940
that deposed Mosaddegh,
and installed Reza Pahlavi as Shah.

12
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,550
The young child was known
for opulence and excess.

13
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:25,640
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk,

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,960
while the Shah had his lunches
flown in by concord from Paris.

15
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,770
The people starved.

16
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,650
The Shah kept power through
his ruthless internal police,

17
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,130
the Savak.

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,650
An era of torture and fear began.

19
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,400
He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran,

20
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:54,420
enraging the the mostly
traditional Shia population.

21
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:59,250
In 1979,
the people of Iran overthrew the Shah.

22
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,820
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:14,030
It descended into score settling,
death squads and chaos.

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,470
Dying of cancer, the Shah
was given asylum in the US.

25
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,140
The Iranian people took
to the streets outside the US embassy,

26
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,810
demanding that the Shah
be returned, tried…

27
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,120
and hanged.

28
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:44,130
The carnival is a
little bigger today, huh?

29
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,580
The windows are supposed
to be bulletproof, right?

30
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:50,920
They have never been tested.

31
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,420
Okay, you just need to finish filling out

32
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,940
this section here.

33
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,320
We need some security.

34
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,390
Yes, it is your responsibility-

35
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,150
They drew over the walls.

36
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,340
We should all split.

37
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,810
I'm gonna close up my office.

38
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,550
My God!

39
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,850
Marins to Number 1.

40
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,810
Full back.

41
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,660
– Look, I need police,
– Can anyone hear me?

42
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,580
– I need police right now.
– We're on the second floor.

43
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,360
– You understand me?
– We need help.

44
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,500
Right now, goddamn it!

45
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,510
Can anybody hear me?

46
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,340
There is a breach.

47
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,970
Burn everything! Burn it, now!

48
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,940
Alright burn everything,
all the files, file cabinets, safe.

49
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,830
Lets get a cart over here.

50
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,930
Burn it all, come on!

51
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,320
Burn everything, including
the classified. Everything!

52
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,640
Don't fucking shoot anybody.

53
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,390
You don't want to be
the son of a bitch who started the war.

54
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,340
They need an hour to burn the classified.

55
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,290
I need you to hold.

56
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:07,800
If you shoot one person,

57
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,400
they're gonna kill every
single one of us in here.

58
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,270
I'm telling you if we're going to go,
we need to go now!

59
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,420
– And we need to make a decision, and-
– Joe can we- Joe can we wait,

60
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:26,180
can we wait until
the Iranian police come?

61
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,600
– No!
– They're not coming.

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,460
How do you know they're not coming?

63
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,490
They may well be coming.

64
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,790
The police have abandoned their post-

65
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,320
If the police are not coming, okay,
then the army's gonna come.

66
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,160
The Prime Minister is not gonna let
the embassy be taken over.

67
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:37,780
I understand. The Prime Minister
may come tomorrow,

68
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,260
but the Komiteh are here today.

69
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,420
Alright, is there- is there any value
that we're waiting 15-

70
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,190
Look at me!

71
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,490
No one is coming.

72
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,920
Burn it!
We have forty minutes.

73
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:50,390
Get it down to the incinerator,
in the vault. Now!

74
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,260
Tear gas is a last resort only.

75
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:54,950
I repeat: only if you're under threat.

76
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,860
In here, we are in America right now,
outside of these doors, we are in Iran!

77
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,790
I'm not going out there!

78
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,560
– They're not safe here.
-Alright, first let's get these-

79
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,730
If they get caught
applying for visas to the US…

80
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,220
You know what, lets-
lets wait five minutes.

81
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,600
We're in the only building
with direct access to the street,

82
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
if we're going to go,
then we need to go now!

83
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,350
– Yeah, I'm in.
– Yeah.

84
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,180
Yeah, lets go.

85
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:56,270
I'm going outside.

86
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,200
Why?

87
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,570
To reason them.

88
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,200
Open the door!

89
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,480
Open the door!

90
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,480
Open this goddamn door!

91
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,620
You said you wanna see the world, Elton?

92
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,490
Let me in! Let me in!

93
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,340
– Burn it all, come on!
– Right come on, guys!

94
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:49,810
The safe and the filing cabinets get long.

95
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,830
All four drawers,
I want them shredded, right now!

96
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,230
But the shred not fast enough.

97
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:04,250
Guys, get the visa plates.

98
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,710
All four, and anything
else you see out there.

99
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:10,070
If in doubt, you shred it.

100
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,250
We've got ten minutes,
lets go, go, go, everything!

101
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:25,740
Get the shredder.

102
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,370
There are no police.

103
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,000
– Okay.
– Come on.

104
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,150
– Where do we go?
– We gotta get off the streets.

105
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,130
This way, up here to the left.

106
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,290
These fucks hit us,
we can't hit 'em back?

107
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,290
Mossaddegh, we did it to them first.

108
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,380
The Soviets would put up with this shit,
they would fucking invade them.

109
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,030
Shaffer!

110
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:16,770
Sir, what d'you expect? We helped the guy
torture and deball an entire population.

111
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,530
How many were there?

112
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,200
At least fifty. We're not sure.

113
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,520
Shaffer!

114
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,780
You still haven't found Shaffer?

115
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,990
No I was screaming his name
'cos I was fucking 'em.

116
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,130
It's confirmed, sir, six escaped.

117
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:30,310
I was told five.

118
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,680
Now sir, apparently it's six.

119
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,640
So what happened?

120
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,710
Not clear. We know they
escaped the embassy.

121
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:35,550
Where are they?

122
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,130
The Canadian Ambassador's house.

123
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,900
Do they stay put?
Are we attempting a rescue?

124
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,410
I put through the Secretary of State.

125
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,490
Yes.

126
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:42,940
Is White House joining?

127
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,030
They're claiming the Embassy
was a den of espionage.

128
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
We wish it was a fucking den of espionage.

129
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,510
CIA's got three people over there,
they don't see a revolution coming?

130
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,210
Call it something other then intelligence.

131
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,920
Hold for the Chief of Staff.
Harding?

132
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:53,780
I'll call him back.

133
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,600
They're sticking to it, no release
till we expel the Shah.

134
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,050
Well, put him on a plane then, fuck him!

135
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,450
He's half dead and he's in chemo.

136
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,340
Well, we took him in, he's ours now.

137
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,790
Great, so we'll take any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

138
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,320
Just the pricks on our side.

139
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,610
So all of our other pricks
on their prick thrones

140
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,050
will know that when they
get thrown out on a rail,

141
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,650
they won't get their
fucking spleens taken out

142
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:12,480
by some camel vet in Sinai.

143
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,580
What about the six who are
with the Canadians?

144
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,590
We've got sixty in the Embassy
with guns to their heads right now.

145
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:19,860
The whole world is
watching the Embassy.

146
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,340
That makes them safer
than the six on the street.

147
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,680
Bonnie Sauder's saying
it will be over in twenty-four hours.

148
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,630
We leave the six where they are.

149
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:30,630
I'll go brief the President.

150
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,930
Right, I'll through it.

151
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:07,020
Iran's Revolutionary Guard, has
rounded up a gang of terrorist blamed

152
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:10,850
for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.

153
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:15,090
It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been raised.

154
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:20,020
This by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran,

155
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:23,690
there is no change reported
in the hostage situation.

156
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:27,600
In this country, George Mitty died last
night, he was eighty five years old.

157
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Yeah.

158
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,780
Yes.

159
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,730
What?

160
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,470
To begin with, of course,
we wanted to learn

161
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,930
about the hostages held in
the American Embassy compound.

162
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:46,570
They may not understand what their
ordeal means to their countrymen.

163
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,100
That this nation,
their nation, is outraged.

164
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,660
And we cannot really
know what it is like

165
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,370
inside the prison
that was once our embassy.

166
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:59,240
Actions of Iran have shocked
the civilized world.

167
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,090
Our embassy has been seized, and
more than sixty American citizens

168
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:07,000
continue to be held as hostages,-

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,200
As the situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged for the hostages,-

170
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,670
the NBC situation in Iran
has changed however-

171
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,790
What happened?

172
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,150
Six of them went out a back exit.

173
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,010
Brits turned them away,

174
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,750
Kiwis turned them away,
Canadians took 'em in.

175
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:37,070
Traffic calls them 'House Guests'.

176
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,520
They haven't left the Canadian
Ambassador's house since it happened.

177
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,040
Why didn't we get them ten weeks ago?

178
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,870
Too dangerous.

179
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,440
We got revolutionary guards going
door to door, like Jehovah's Witnesses.

180
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,150
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the Embassy.

181
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,260
What about the White House?

182
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,920
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

183
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,920
The Canadians are done,

184
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,410
they say they're baring too much risk.

185
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,470
Their Foreign Secretary
corners Vance in Brussels,

186
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,270
and told him she wants
the six of them out.

187
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,290
Who else knows?

188
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,690
Just the families.

189
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:06,840
Meanwhile, some genius in our Embassy

190
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,240
was keeping a mug book on
everybody who worked there.

191
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,780
Jesus Christ!

192
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,120
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

193
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,240
But now the bastards are using

194
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,720
sweatshop kids
to reassemble the shreds.

195
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,180
Once they reassemble that book,
they'll know six Americans got out

196
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,780
and they'll know what they look like.

197
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:25,320
Standing room only for
beheadings in the square.

198
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,440
Who's handling?

199
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
State is coordinating in-house.

200
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:31,070
State?

201
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,070
They don't do exfil's.

202
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,150
They do now.

203
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,890
They wanna run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

204
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,950
Engell says, it's a lose-lose.

205
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:40,380
These people die,

206
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,380
they die badly, publicly.

207
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,090
State wants the blame,

208
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,120
we'll give it to 'em.

209
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,350
What does he want me here for?

210
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,780
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

211
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,320
Okay.

212
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,610
This is Bob Pender from State OS,

213
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,610
he's been talking
to Morgan, an ex-staff.

214
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,610
Thank you.

215
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,380
Alright.

216
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,290
Mark and Cora Lijek,
twenty-nine and twenty-five,

217
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:14,580
he's a Consular Officer, she's
an assistant, newly weds,

218
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,470
They uh… only just got
there a couple months ago,

219
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,440
No language skills
or in-country knowledge.

220
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,840
Henry Lee Schatz,

221
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:25,180
Agricultural attaché from Idaho,

222
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:27,180
a bit of an oddball apparently,

223
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:30,780
he was there to sell U.S.
tractors to Iranian agro.

224
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,980
Joe Stafford, late twenties

225
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,090
he's smart

226
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,180
and a climber, speaks Farsi,

227
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,580
he arranged the hire of his wife,

228
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,640
Kathy.

229
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,980
The Embassy was understaffed,

230
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
so the faculty wives
were the typing pool.

231
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,290
And Bob Anders,

232
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,670
senior consular officer,
oldest of the group,

233
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,440
and most likely to be group leader.

234
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,070
They've been hiding at the
Canadian Ambassador's residence.

235
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,490
Fortunately, we do not believe the
Iranians are aware the six have escaped.

236
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,290
So…

237
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,980
What we'd like for this are bicycles.

238
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:03,470
We've identified back roads
from the Chamran district,

239
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,810
couple of rat lines
through the mountains

240
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:07,380
to the crossing near Tabriz.

241
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,470
Cars are off the table,

242
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,950
because of the road blocks.

243
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,410
We wait until the weather clears up,

244
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:13,780
then deliver the six bikes,

245
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:15,780
provide them with maps
to the Turkish border.

246
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,290
We have intelligence,
they can ride bicycles

247
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,180
or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach 'em.

248
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,870
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

249
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,780
Tony…

250
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,350
It's three hundred miles
to the Turkish border.

251
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,150
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

252
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:42,930
We were just asked to sharp shoot this,
State is handling the ops.

253
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm sorry, who is this?

254
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,470
Tony is an exfil spesh,

255
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,210
he's got a lot of Shah's
people out after the fall.

256
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:51,780
Sir, if these people can read or add,

257
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,640
pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

258
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,750
It's winter. You can't afford
to wait around until spring,

259
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,270
so it's nice enough
to take a bike ride.

260
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,270
They only way out
of that city is the airport.

261
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,070
You build new cover identities for 'em,

262
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:05,240
you send in a Moses, he takes
them out on a commercial flight.

263
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,130
We've explored those options.

264
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,010
You're never gonna get them through
airport control, Komiteh own the place.

265
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,520
They could pose as reporters, if the
government issued seventy something…

266
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,470
– Seventy four.
– Visas,

267
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:16,290
– for American journalists…
– And the Revolutionary Guards

268
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,870
keep them on seventy four leashes.

269
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,870
If they're caught with
fake journalist creds,

270
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,010
it's Peter and Jane's head
in a noose in an hour.

271
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,810
Look, North America accents
gives us limited options,

272
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,420
so we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

273
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,990
What about English teachers
at the international school?

274
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,190
It's a good idea, but that school's
been closed for eight months.

275
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:33,750
Okay, so how about
'the do-gooders'?

276
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,920
Six Canadians have been over there

277
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:39,320
inspecting crops, ensuring the kids
are getting enough to eat,

278
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:42,090
we give them creds, makes
them look like ag' NGOs.

279
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,090
It's a 'feed the kids' thing.

280
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:44,980
Okay.

281
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,210
Those kids are black.

282
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,440
Those are African kids.

283
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,520
We can get ethnically appropriate kids.

284
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,240
Are there starving kids in Iran?

285
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,780
I'm sure there's some
skinny kids in Iran.

286
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,590
What about missionary?
– Or… seeds…

287
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,140
called… "seeds of hope".

288
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,070
Hold on… Sir, do you have
this newspaper in front of you?

289
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,660
Would you mind taking a look at it?

290
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,720
What's in this picture?

291
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,040
Tehran.

292
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,410
Right.
What's on the ground?

293
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,640
– Snow.
– Right.

294
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,380
So what crops are the 'do-gooders'
inspecting under frosting?

295
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:18,870
Sir…

296
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,320
Exfils are like abortions.

297
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:22,950
You don't wanna need one.

298
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:25,840
But when you do,
you don't do it yourself.

299
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,750
You have a better plan?

300
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,030
No Sir.

301
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,220
What ever the conflicting
signals from Iran today,

302
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,690
for that matter everyday,

303
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,410
about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies,

304
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:50,320
the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demands:

305
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:52,280
the hostages must be freed.

306
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,520
.. to defend human rights,

307
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,610
it not only does not defend them,

308
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:58,350
it violates them for all nations.

309
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:03,410
We demand extradition of a man
who for more than 37 years,

310
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,700
with the United States support,
has killed months old babies

311
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,440
in the arms of their mothers.

312
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,640
He said that if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages,

313
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,010
the students will kill them all
and blow up the Embassy.

314
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:20,500
Americans were outraged
at Iran and anyone Iranian.

315
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,440
Before this decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.

316
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,870
An Iranian flag was burned,
while Anti-Iranians demonstrators

317
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,470
gathered near the Iranian
Consulate. The demonstrators-

318
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,970
.. also it's what led to a decision
to scrutinize the bases of the Iranian-

319
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,090
They knew exactly what
was going on, they knew it.

320
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,660
But I don't understand wha-
what they should do now,

321
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,330
send them back, just to-
to be tortured and killed?

322
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,140
I don't think that justice
is the worst thing.

323
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:46,910
When did people first tell you
that torture was going on in Iran?

324
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,460
They would never come to me and say:

325
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:51,210
"Well Sir, we have tortured this fellow".

326
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:54,580
.. Sadat of Egypt he calls you Imam,

327
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,490
forgive me, his words not mine: A lunatic.

328
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,350
Why didn't he have a choice,
why do you think he didn't have a choice?

329
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,210
Because he would have been
referred to as a barbarian.

330
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,230
– Please!
– That's why they're stating

331
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,870
he liked the current regime!

332
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:07,930
The Shah did more for women's right-

333
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,120
I think we've better if…

334
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,560
Please everyone, get into the coal.

335
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:29,350
.. Get out of here!

336
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,610
At one point the mob
cornered one of Iranians.

337
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:34,870
When he tried to protect
himself, this is what happened.

338
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:36,980
Hit him again!

339
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,070
Hit him until he can't take it anymore!

340
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,070
We're sick of them!
– Yeah!

341
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,290
America!

342
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,390
.. even in our little community here,

343
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,670
I mean people are drawn
uptight, they're tense.

344
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,840
They shouldn't even let those
students in that Embassy there.

345
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:55,890
Just shoot a couple of 'em.
Show 'em we mean business.

346
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,120
Men who served in Vietnam for what
they believed was right are angry.

347
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,180
I'm mad as hell.

348
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,980
I'm- I'm like the guy screaming on that
movie program in 'network' you know,

349
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:07,430
I've had it! And if huh…

350
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,750
if need be I'll bear arms again!

351
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:13,720
That's the way it is,
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.

352
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:18,070
74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.

353
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:27,470
Hello?

354
00:22:27,470 --> 00:22:28,410
My man!

355
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,780
I'll get mom.

356
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,570
I'm calling for you.

357
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,380
Did you do your homework tonight?

358
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,520
Yeah it was easy.

359
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,520
Excellent.
What are we watching?

360
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:39,950
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

361
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:42,150
Tell me, what channel is it on?

362
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,290
Five.

363
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,670
Alright.

364
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,040
What did you do at school today?

365
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,780
Nothing, I don't know.
Nothing.

366
00:22:55,890 --> 00:22:58,580
It can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

367
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:00,360
After school I've traded baseball cards,-

368
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,610
Hmm-Hmm…

369
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,240
Ok you know those science
fiction, Star Trek, Star Wars,

370
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,090
they need an exotic location to shoot,

371
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,090
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know…

372
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,820
Now image this.

373
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:33,270
They're a Canadian film crew on a location
scout for a science fiction movie.

374
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,010
We put it out there,

375
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,010
the Canadian producers
put it out there.

376
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,550
They were looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

377
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:44,240
Then we go to the Consulate and say:
'Hey, we want to look in Iran too'.

378
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,950
I fly into Tehran, we all fly
out together as a film crew.

379
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,070
Done.

380
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,420
Flamboyant cover identity
should be avoided

381
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,130
as it increases operational visibility.

382
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,530
This is a lot more
plausible than foreigners

383
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,070
who wanna become teachers in Iran.

384
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,780
You want to blend in with the population
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

385
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,610
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

386
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,440
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

387
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,920
No Sir, we have a contact in-

388
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,320
– Chambers.
– John Chambers,

389
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,750
he's a Hollywood prosthetics guy, he's got
an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes

390
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,010
he's done a bunch of contract
work for us in the past.

391
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,750
I go see him, he sets this up.

392
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,840
One, two days, make it look real.

393
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,350
I went outside for thirty seconds.

394
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,090
Alright?

395
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,980
Could you give me a break?
I can't breath in this house.

396
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:37,040
I need some fresh air,
I can't- I can't breath!

397
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,290
Stay inside the fucking house!

398
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,420
Who saw me go outside, I'm just curious?

399
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:40,800
– That's not the point.
– That's not the point Bob.

400
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:42,290
Doesn't matter if I saw you
go out or you see me.

401
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,120
– Did you see me go out?
– No! You did go outside…

402
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,970
I did. Okay, I saw you.

403
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,210
Bob, it only takes one
second for them to spot you.

404
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:56,290
Some Americans are missing.

405
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,690
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

406
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,040
The numbers don't match.

407
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:04,720
Finish assembling the
pictures from the Embassy.

408
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,350
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

409
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,210
Yes Sir, it'll be done.

410
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:23,090
We want you to go to LA.

411
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:26,270
If you can make the movie thing
credible, we'll take it to the director.

412
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,270
Don't fuck up.

413
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:30,750
The whole country is watching you.

414
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,980
They just don't know it.

415
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,270
My creation…

416
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,780
My creation!

417
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:52,350
What the fuck, Bryan?

418
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,980
– Cut!
– We are cutting!

419
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,610
Chambers!

420
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,610
John Chambers make up!

421
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,980
He says the minotaur prosthetic
is too tight so he can't act.

422
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,090
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing a minotaur.

423
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,410
Mr. Chambers…

424
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:28,410
Kevin Arkins.

425
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,780
Hey Tony.

426
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,290
What are you shooting?

427
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,290
Monster movie.

428
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,670
Yeah? Any good?

429
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,010
Target audience will hate it.

430
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,010
Who's the target audience?

431
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:10,070
People with eyes.

432
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,240
Talk to me.

433
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,550
It's an exfil.

434
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:18,810
From where?

435
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,870
Worst place you can think of.

436
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,870
Universal Studio.

437
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,750
How are you gonna get in the Embassy?

438
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:33,010
They're not in the Embassy.

439
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,320
During the takeover six people escaped.

440
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,320
They're hiding out in Tehran…

441
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,310
and that's who I'm gonna go get.

442
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,620
What am I making?

443
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,730
I need you to help me
make a fake movie.

444
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,090
Well, you're in the right place.

445
00:27:46,690 --> 00:27:49,840
I wanna setup a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

446
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:51,840
– That we're not gonna make.
– No.

447
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,860
So you wanna come to
Hollywood and act like a big shot,

448
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,370
Yeah.

449
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,000
– without actually doing anything.
– No.

450
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,320
You'll fit right in.

451
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,780
Let's see.

452
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,150
Well this one has got an M.A. in English,
she should be your screenwriter.

453
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:13,320
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want their free meals.

454
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,840
Here's your director.

455
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,410
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

456
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,120
You teach a recess monkey
to be a director in a day.

457
00:28:20,610 --> 00:28:23,610
Look if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

458
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:26,240
The Kominiacs are fruit loops,
but they got cousins

459
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,980
who sell prayer rugs
and A-tracks on Le Brea.

460
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:33,010
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

461
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,350
You need a script, you need a producer.

462
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,380
Make me a producer.

463
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:39,320
No. You're… an
associate producer at best.

464
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:43,870
You're gonna do a 20 million
dollars Star Wars rip-off.

465
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:47,580
You need somebody who's a somebody,
to put their name on it.

466
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,580
Somebody respectable…

467
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:52,010
with credits…

468
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:55,810
who you can trust
with classified information…

469
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,980
who'd produce a fake movie…

470
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:00,980
for free.

471
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,350
Hi, I only got a couple of minutes.

472
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,120
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award.

473
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,440
Mazel tov, Lester.

474
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,210
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

475
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:24,750
Okay.

476
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:27,930
You got six people hiding out
in a town of what… 4 million people,

477
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:31,780
all of whom chant death to
America' all the live long day.

478
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,750
You want to set up a movie in a week,

479
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:37,270
you want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living,

480
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,980
then you're gonna sneak 007 over here,

481
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,520
into a country that wants CIA
blood on their breakfast cereal,

482
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:47,180
and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

483
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,180
That's about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

484
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,640
Right.

485
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,380
Look I… I got to tell ya,

486
00:29:56,520 --> 00:30:00,270
we- we did suicide missions in the
Army that had better odds than this.

487
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,780
Sir, the car is here.

488
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,350
You ever think, Lester,
this is all for the cameras?

489
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,880
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for them.

490
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,710
We're going to need a script.

491
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:00,810
I love you.

492
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,950
Sahar, how are you doing?

493
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,150
Fine, thank you.

494
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:18,860
Your friends from Canada, ma'am,

495
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,890
all this time, they never go out.

496
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,570
Sahar knows.

497
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,440
How about 'The Horses of Achilles'?

498
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:46,380
Νо gооd. Νоbоdy dоеѕ wеѕtеrnѕ аnymоrе.

499
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,670
It's ancient Troy.

500
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,890
If it's got horses in it,
it's a western.

501
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,180
Hey, Kenny please?

502
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,440
Yeah it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

503
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,580
It doesn't matter.

504
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,010
It's a fake movie.

505
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,010
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's going to be a fake hit.

506
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:04,550
Cardinal wants all cover options
on his desk Friday morning.

507
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:08,120
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
teachers option,

508
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,550
you have 72 hours to make yours better.

509
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,700
Fine.

510
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:41,070
Hey is 8006 still on the open list?

511
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,410
Yeah I'll hold.

512
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,520
Fade in on a starship landing.

513
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,720
An exotic Middle Eastern vibe.

514
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,810
Women gather offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

515
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,040
Argo.

516
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,840
"A Science-Fantasy Adventure."

517
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,340
It's a turnaround, it's dog shit.

518
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,710
It's a space movie in the Middle East.
Does it matter if-

519
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,810
Could we get the option?

520
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,780
Why do we need the option?

521
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,780
You're worried about the Ayatollah?

522
00:33:04,890 --> 00:33:06,780
Try the WGA.

523
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,270
Just let me do the talking.

524
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,000
I've known this guy for 25 years,
he's full of shit, and he comes on hard,

525
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,920
but uh… I can handle it.

526
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,270
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

527
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,010
Up like a carny ride.

528
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,090
One month, yeah.

529
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,750
– Who are you again?
– Kevin Arkins, Studio 6 Films.

530
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:26,690
He's the money.

531
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,320
Look, what d'you say uh…

532
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:32,840
fifteen thou'and, let's close on this?

533
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,180
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

534
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,550
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

535
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,670
Alright.

536
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,070
I enjoyed your films, the early ones.

537
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:47,810
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

538
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,890
Thank you. Very respectful.

539
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,520
You're finished, Lester.

540
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,490
Get your cataracts fixed,
read the trades.

541
00:33:56,070 --> 00:33:58,610
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

542
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:00,750
They're screaming for Sci-Fi.

543
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,090
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

544
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,580
Well… what can I say?

545
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,840
Congratulations.

546
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:13,210
But see,

547
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,380
it kind of worries me what you
said, let me tell you why.

548
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:21,070
Couple of weeks ago I was sitting
at Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai,

549
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,890
when my pal, Warren Beatty comes in,

550
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:25,240
he wishes me well,
we have a little chat.

551
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:28,490
Seems he was attached
to star in 'Zulu Empire',

552
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,870
which was just gonna anchor
that MGM slate.

553
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:34,240
But Warren confided in me that
the picture's gone over budget

554
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:37,320
because the Zulu extras
want to unionize.

555
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:41,520
They may be cannibals, but they want
health and dental so the movie's kaput!

556
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,070
Which means that the MGM
deal ain't gonna happen,

557
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:48,270
and your script ain't worth
a buffalo shit on a nickel!

558
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:52,350
So, the way it looks to me through
the cataracts I grant you,

559
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,350
is that you can either sign here,

560
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,470
and take 10,000 dollars
for your toilet-paper script,

561
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,470
or you can go fuck yourself!

562
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,240
With all due respect.

563
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,410
You really know Warren Beatty?

564
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:11,610
Yes I do.

565
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:14,010
I took a leak next to him
once at the Golder Globes.

566
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,010
Taco?

567
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:36,120
Got any kids, Lester?

568
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,180
Yeah, I have two daughters.

569
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,750
See 'em much?

570
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:44,320
I talk to 'em once a year…

571
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,840
maybe.

572
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:46,720
Why is that?

573
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:52,210
I was a terrible father.

574
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,950
The bullshit business…

575
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:59,380
it's like coal mining, you- you
come home to your wife and kids,

576
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:01,440
you can't… you can't wash it off.

577
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:03,980
You?

578
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:06,820
Yeah I got a son.

579
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,290
He lives in Virgina with his mother.

580
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,440
You're divorced?

581
00:36:16,470 --> 00:36:17,690
Taking time off.

582
00:36:20,270 --> 00:36:21,550
He needs to be, you know…

583
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,690
where he is.

584
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,520
Kids need the mother.

585
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:40,980
They caught the Shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

586
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,210
Listen,

587
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:47,270
"since the incident, the number
of guards at the airport has doubled,

588
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,780
a thorough background examination
should be expected".

589
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,380
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet,

590
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,890
I need another week, Jack.

591
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,120
You don't have it.

592
00:36:58,290 --> 00:36:59,580
We got an office,

593
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,270
we got business cards,

594
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,670
we got a poster.

595
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,980
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, there's
nothing we couldn't have made at home.

596
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,580
Six people's lives depend on this.

597
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:12,920
It's not enough.

598
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:15,950
If we're gonna fool these people,
it has to be big,

599
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,610
and it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

600
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:22,670
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

601
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:26,380
If you want to sell a lie…

602
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,010
get the press to sell it for you.

603
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,580
No no no, press event, then they're-
they're gonna read through the script.

604
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:38,720
I got a bunch of actors who are gonna read
from beginning to end, all the way through.

605
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,870
They have costumes and everything.

606
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,810
No, no, no, I can't, I got, uh,
Variety has the exclusive on that.

607
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,150
Any way to make this more uh…
Middle Eastern?

608
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,490
Mesopotamia?
Egypt?

609
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,690
Iran.

610
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:55,410
Look, I can get you in, but you
gotta promise me at least half a page.

611
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,810
No, no, this thing's an event,
it's going to be a spectacle.

612
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:01,380
Lester.

613
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:04,470
Nina, you look fabulous!

614
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,690
You doing the reading?

615
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:08,010
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

616
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:09,440
Great, I'll call ya.

617
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,210
Keep that fucking space
witch away from me.

618
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,290
You know her?

619
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,720
I was married to her.

620
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,720
Oh my God, Iraq is amazing!

621
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,780
Well, we're shooting in Iran.

622
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,410
Iran with an N?

623
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,070
Yeah.
We're very excited.

624
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,550
You ever watch the news?

625
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,550
What does the title refer to?

626
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,550
The Argo!

627
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:29,550
The thing…

628
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,720
Like Jason and the
Golden Fleece, or what?

629
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:34,550
No, no, it's the ship, it's the-
the spaceship, it goes…

630
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,320
it goes everywhere, it goes all…

631
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,320
…all throughout space.

632
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,670
So it's the Argonaut?

633
00:39:41,410 --> 00:39:42,040
No.

634
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,520
What- what does Argo mean?

635
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,610
I don't know.

636
00:39:44,690 --> 00:39:45,670
You don't know?

637
00:39:45,890 --> 00:39:48,380
It means "Argo, fuck yourself"!

638
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,520
Will you pay me every attention,
ladies and gentlemen?

639
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:57,070
If our artists could settle in,
we'll just be ready to begin the reading.

640
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,740
Argo. From Mary Ann Boyd.

641
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,420
Begin on starship…

642
00:40:16,430 --> 00:40:19,620
The people working here are not diplomats.

643
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:22,450
In fact, as the Iman Khomeini said,

644
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:26,500
they have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.

645
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:31,030
All evidence proves that
these people are spies.

646
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:34,830
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful,

647
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,640
our message to the waking
peoples of the world,

648
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,740
at this time we want to expose
the hateful acts of United States…

649
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,580
Our world has changed,

650
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:46,730
Fires of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

651
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:48,510
The ship is turning around.

652
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,280
Fire the thrusters!

653
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:53,380
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill any…

654
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:57,640
.. completely unjustified.
They and all others must know

655
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,790
that the United States
of America will not yield

656
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,890
to International Terrorism
or to blackmail.

657
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,960
Sir, we'll be crashed.

658
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:08,300
There's no enough time to…
– .. are controlled by capitalists,

659
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:09,920
and large oil companies.

660
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,420
The United States government considers
revolutionists as terrorists,

661
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:20,670
but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

662
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,660
We'll find her ship,
we will find our chance.

663
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,290
For the Argo lies my hope,

664
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,570
my hero, my husband.

665
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,860
.. We will begin the trials and
carry out the sentences.

666
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,610
.. We wonder where and how this apparently
endless parade of hatred will end.

667
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,760
What do they want?

668
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,500
They say the question should
be not 'what', but 'who'.

669
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:48,730
The answer to this question is clear,
they want the former Shah,

670
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,070
.. They should be ashamed
to talk about human rights.

671
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,380
Carter and his government
have given asylum

672
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,930
to the worst criminal.
– .. in this compound,

673
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:57,230
for what, for life?

674
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:01,170
They will remain until
the Shah is returned.

675
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,550
But if the exiled Shah,
now in the New York City hospital,

676
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,990
leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran,

677
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:11,700
harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.

678
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:19,220
.. We go outside of the ship now,

679
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,410
holding on a single red flower

680
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,330
as it goes to the ruins
of the starship in the desert,

681
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:29,220
fade to Back. The end.

682
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,860
Here it is. What did I tell you!

683
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:39,950
First shot of the picture.

684
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:44,700
"Argo, fuck yourself."

685
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:46,760
Argo, fuck yourself.

686
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:25,500
Brace yourself.

687
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:28,640
It's like talking to those two
old fucks from The Muppets.

688
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,170
Aliens and robots?

689
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,130
Yes, sir.

690
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:40,230
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now,

691
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,550
that is funded by the CIA?

692
00:43:43,050 --> 00:43:44,600
– Yes, sir.

693
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,440
What's wrong with the bikes again?

694
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,170
We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

695
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,180
You think… you think this is
more plausible than teachers?

696
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:55,620
Yes, we do. One, there are no more
foreign teachers in Iran…

697
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:57,770
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people,

698
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:59,780
and everybody knows they
ain't shootin' Stalingrad,

699
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:01,770
with Bob Hope directing
if it would sell tickets.

700
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:04,790
There are only bad options,

701
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,400
it's about finding the best one.

702
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,760
You don't have a better
bad idea than this?

703
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:12,660
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

704
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,280
By far.

705
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:26,360
The United States Government has just
sanctioned your Science Fiction movie.

706
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,150
Thank you, sir.

707
00:45:04,850 --> 00:45:10,540
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

708
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:13,620
Barely claim me as it is.

709
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:16,970
Is there any in case of obstacle?

710
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,860
Just Christine.

711
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,210
I should have brought some
books to read in prison.

712
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,290
No.

713
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,020
They'll kill you long before prison.

714
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,620
– Thanks for the ride.
– Yeah.

715
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:43,930
– Studio 6.
– We got a green light.

716
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,240
Keep the office running
until you hear otherwise.

717
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:49,360
– Argo fuck yourself.
– Argo fuck yourself.

718
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,860
Your attention please,

719
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,910
this is the final calling for
British Airways flight 87.

720
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:48,520
We are a nation of 35 millions,

721
00:46:48,630 --> 00:46:53,250
and many of these people
are looking for to murder them.

722
00:46:55,550 --> 00:46:56,450
Hey.

723
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:57,490
Hey.

724
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:00,340
Come to bed.

725
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,050
Another 5 minutes.

726
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:16,480
She pleaded with me.

727
00:47:17,220 --> 00:47:20,180
When it started in the streets
nine months ago, she…

728
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:24,200
she begged for us to leave.

729
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,520
She packed our bags.

730
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,200
I said, "just- just a little bit longer".

731
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:37,010
And all I was thinking was…

732
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,990
"stay…

733
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:42,180
this is good for me.

734
00:47:43,490 --> 00:47:44,780
Stay.

735
00:47:48,090 --> 00:47:50,550
Show Newsom you got the balls".

736
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,740
I can't believe I put Kathy
in this position.

737
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,290
I think we're gonna die here.

738
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:03,010
"Iran is a hundred percent not
in a pre-revolutionary state".

739
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:06,280
CIA brief, November, 1st, 1979.

740
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:08,810
Can't be right all the time.

741
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,490
Kevin?

742
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:12,140
When did you get back?

743
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:16,420
The Shah escaped on the 747
so laden with gold bars,

744
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,780
that they didn't make it off the runway.

745
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,430
But you kept busy.

746
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:24,810
Fairing out the torture apparatus
of our friends fallen dictation.

747
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,260
It's getting worse.

748
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:30,840
Anyone that lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

749
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:33,480
This strip makes a copy
to the one underneath,

750
00:49:33,530 --> 00:49:35,950
passenger keeps yellow,
airport keeps white,

751
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,500
when you leave the country,
they match them up

752
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:39,800
to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

753
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:41,200
So if they look,

754
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,940
they'll see I didn't come into
the country with six people.

755
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,220
If they look.

756
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,420
When you land, you should go straight
to the Ministry of Culture and…

757
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,660
Islamic Guidance, kiss the ring.

758
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,350
Get on record as having
applied for film permit.

759
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:02,270
If they catch you later, at least they'll
be confused while they're torturing you.

760
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:09,000
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

761
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:22,570
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

762
00:50:22,620 --> 00:50:26,120
Uh… film production. Business.

763
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:31,050
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

764
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:35,970
Well, I would have loved to, except my
boss didn't send a telex until I got here.

765
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:40,350
If the guy had an intelligent thought
in his head, it would die of loneliness.

766
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:03,190
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

767
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:07,160
They know who they are, and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

768
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:09,350
Somebody withdrew on the family's talk.

769
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:10,560
Mother of God.

770
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,560
Yeah I just put Vance on a plane to
take the head of eds to a circus,

771
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:16,170
he thinks he can get him
to sit on it for now.

772
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,670
You guy'd better get them.

773
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,870
And get the hell out.

774
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:25,620
The Captain has informed us
that we're entering Iranian airspace.

775
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,490
We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.

776
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,920
This film crew is just yourself?

777
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:13,700
No, we have six more from
Canada meeting us today.

778
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,930
You'd like to film at the bazaar?

779
00:54:16,250 --> 00:54:18,710
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

780
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,630
Landmark sites.

781
00:54:20,910 --> 00:54:22,250
I see.

782
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,200
The exotic orients.

783
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:28,400
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

784
00:54:29,770 --> 00:54:32,370
You came to us at a complicated time.

785
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,950
Before the revolution forty percent
of the movie theaters in Tehran

786
00:54:35,950 --> 00:54:37,730
were showing pornograph.

787
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,420
I understand.

788
00:54:39,530 --> 00:54:42,540
The function of this
office is purification,

789
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:45,920
as well as promotion for the arts.

790
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:50,060
I'll review this for the Ministry.

791
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,820
Thank you.

792
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,900
– Salam.
– Salam.

793
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:03,480
Lester, you're working late.

794
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:05,460
Until the dawns early light.

795
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:09,740
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

796
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:13,710
Well, I'm a hundred and fifty years
old, so you wouldn't be me for long.

797
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,890
– Ambassador.
– Ken Taylor.

798
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,850
Thank you for what you're doing.

799
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,480
I was expecting more of a G-Man look.

800
00:55:30,990 --> 00:55:33,510
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

801
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,490
Ah. This way.

802
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:50,600
These are blank- you know, stamps…

803
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,860
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

804
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:55,550
How long?

805
00:55:55,910 --> 00:55:58,410
A day to prep their covers…
two if they need it.

806
00:55:58,460 --> 00:56:00,120
And- and you'll fly out with them?

807
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,560
Yeah.

808
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,670
There's something you should know.

809
00:56:03,980 --> 00:56:07,080
We think our housekeeper's
figured out who they are.

810
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:12,130
We don't know if we can trust her.
So, sooner is better.

811
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:03,460
Hi.

812
00:57:03,550 --> 00:57:05,500
Hi. My name's Kevin Harkins…

813
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:08,180
and I'm gonna get you home.

814
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,420
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

815
00:57:13,950 --> 00:57:16,230
It's- it's theater of the absurd.

816
00:57:16,270 --> 00:57:17,700
What are our chances?

817
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,190
Chances are good.

818
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:22,430
Good? Well, what's the uh…
what's the number value of good?

819
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,490
A thirty percent chance of
being publicly executed?

820
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,750
Can you- can you tell me what the
objection was to normal cover identities?

821
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,970
There are no Canadians in
the country for no reason.

822
00:57:31,050 --> 00:57:32,350
They'll sniff us out regardless.

823
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,380
The Swedish Consul, they- they accused him
of being an American at the airport,

824
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,570
they held him for an hour.

825
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:39,630
We can't hold upon that, we don't know
what the hell movie people do.

826
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,700
That's why I'm here.

827
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:44,630
I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna be
with you the whole way. This is what I do.

828
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:47,930
Have you gotten people
out this way before?

829
00:57:48,530 --> 00:57:50,720
This would be a first.

830
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,810
Do you know that everyday they catch
another friend of the Shah at the airport?

831
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,760
– Joe…
– Kangaroo trials, and-

832
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:00,150
And then firing squads just for having
American names in their phone books.

833
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,050
You've been here and hour,

834
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:05,280
and- and you're asking us to trust
you with our lives, Mr…

835
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,760
Harkins.

836
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,040
That's your real name?

837
00:58:09,150 --> 00:58:10,420
No.

838
00:58:13,210 --> 00:58:17,050
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

839
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:20,550
But it is time to go.

840
00:58:21,610 --> 00:58:24,140
We've got orders to close
the embassy and go back.

841
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:26,460
There's nowhere for them to stay.

842
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,140
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport.

843
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:31,790
I'm serious.

844
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:35,530
I mean no, this is what? The part we say,
this is so crazy it might actually work?

845
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,530
– Come on!
– I saw in Burma, they get people out.

846
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,670
Snitches and Banana Republic, they get
them over the border after the coup,

847
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:42,940
pay the guards at the crossing a
hundred bucks to look the other way.

848
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,080
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

849
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:49,060
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period, that's execution.

850
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:50,400
You got a problem lying, Joe?

851
00:58:50,410 --> 00:58:52,360
But the point is, we can't stay here!

852
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,020
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that.

853
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,130
Pat and I have discussed this,
it's the risk we took.

854
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:02,910
That man out there has got bad
cards and he is going to lose,

855
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,900
and if he loses… it's our lives.

856
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,260
And his life too.

857
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,140
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

858
00:59:13,270 --> 00:59:15,540
We gotta go.

859
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:24,150
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

860
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,960
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

861
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:31,160
Who you are, what you are, where you've
been, complete bio. And then add to that:

862
00:59:31,450 --> 00:59:34,680
where do you vacation, what are you
allergies, who'd you have an affair with.

863
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,190
The only way this works,

864
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:39,750
is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you're dream like them.

865
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:43,170
Get started tonight.

866
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:46,190
I'll be back tomorrow. We'll get going.
Good luck.

867
00:59:51,890 --> 00:59:53,830
Wow, my guy kind of sucks.

868
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,440
What's your name?

869
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:58,520
Mike McEwan A.

870
00:59:58,950 --> 01:00:00,270
Sounds convincing.

871
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:02,390
Kathy, what's your name?

872
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:33,060
The Loveboat will be seeing
fifteen minutes from now.

873
01:00:34,510 --> 01:00:36,990
.. insisted that the crisis in Afghanistan

874
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:40,840
will not divert the attention of the United
States from the plight of the hostages.

875
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:44,100
.. he seems to be if not impotent,
but at least reluctant…

876
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:47,720
The United States finds itself
in such bitter confrontation

877
01:00:47,730 --> 01:00:51,860
with the Soviet Union over that
country's invasion of Afghanistan…

878
01:00:52,160 --> 01:00:54,590
The United States is now
moving towards the decision

879
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:57,090
to boycott the summer
Olympics in Moscow.

880
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,810
Bad new, bad news. Even when
it's good news, it's bad news.

881
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:05,530
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

882
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:36,170
The Minister of Culture and Guidance

883
01:01:36,170 --> 01:01:37,700
has approved your location scout.

884
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:39,230
He will send his representative

885
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:42,770
to meet you and your crew at the
Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 P.M.

886
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,540
They called your bluff.

887
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:48,360
– Maybe they're cooperating.
– Absolutely not.

888
01:01:48,530 --> 01:01:53,200
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot, it's the hive.

889
01:01:53,470 --> 01:01:54,830
Seven Canadians, Jack.

890
01:01:54,870 --> 01:01:58,210
Never give them opening shots at a cover.

891
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:01,510
– Are they even ready?
– They're getting there.

892
01:02:01,750 --> 01:02:03,730
There's no prize for most improvements.

893
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:04,650
I don't have a choice.

894
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:07,750
We say no, they show up at their residence
and drag everyone out at gun point.

895
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:09,620
How well do you think their
covers are gonna hold up

896
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,590
when they're getting their
fingernails pulled out?

897
01:02:31,350 --> 01:02:35,560
You want us to go the Grand Bazaar
at three o'clock in the afternoon?

898
01:02:36,120 --> 01:02:38,840
You said a day learning our cover
then straight to the airport.

899
01:02:38,950 --> 01:02:40,240
– Do they suspect something?

900
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:43,920
What I know is we need to
pretend to be a movie crew.

901
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:48,070
We go to the bazaar today, we
fly from the airport tomorrow.

902
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,310
We won't do it.

903
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,760
He told them that there are six of
us, so then they're expecting six,

904
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,340
it would be suspicious not
to show up at this point.

905
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,280
Goddammit, guys! What else
do we have to do?!

906
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,110
Alright? What el- what-
what's the alternative?!

907
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,860
We don't have to show them
the only cards we're holding,

908
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,160
which is that they
don't know we're here!

909
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:06,600
I get it! That's the ball game,
okay, we- you know,

910
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:09,220
Look, we don't have any other…
other choice! What are we gonna do?!

911
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:11,860
Who says that we'll know
our covers well enough?

912
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:13,420
We're no in the CIA!

913
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:15,900
It's suicide.

914
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:18,450
I'm asking you to trust me.

915
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:22,180
I don't trust you.

916
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:24,920
This is the game, Joe.

917
01:03:25,020 --> 01:03:26,160
What world are you living in?

918
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,230
What world am I…?

919
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:30,080
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob!

920
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,430
It's too dangerous,

921
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:34,030
– I don't want to bring my wife into this.
– Joe, can you stop?

922
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:36,650
Joe?

923
01:03:42,930 --> 01:03:44,850
So, we'll see you at two.

924
01:04:07,930 --> 01:04:13,270
So, don't be recognizable, but look
exactly like your passport photo.

925
01:04:14,210 --> 01:04:16,840
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

926
01:04:18,420 --> 01:04:21,300
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

927
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:24,300
Like this… Okay.

928
01:04:26,550 --> 01:04:28,100
Hello?

929
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:32,260
Hello?

930
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,660
Hello?

931
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:42,430
Who was that?

932
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:47,450
– Mark?
– Yeah?

933
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,930
I'm scared.

934
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:55,380
It's okay.

935
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:43,490
Where are they?

936
01:05:43,730 --> 01:05:45,610
In the kitchen.

937
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:03,990
This is what I do…

938
01:06:04,010 --> 01:06:05,700
I get people out…

939
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,370
and I've never left anyone behind.

940
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:14,330
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

941
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,120
My name is Tony Mendez.

942
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:25,320
I'm from New York, my worked construction,
my mother teaches elementary school,

943
01:06:25,350 --> 01:06:27,960
I have a wife and a ten year old son.

944
01:06:30,380 --> 01:06:34,390
You play along with me today, I promise
you I will get you out tomorrow.

945
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:40,920
Fuck.

946
01:07:50,540 --> 01:07:51,930
Hang on.

947
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:42,190
You alright?

948
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:49,300
Okay, tell me who you are?

949
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:52,080
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

950
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:54,900
Robert Baker, director.

951
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:57,740
Timothy Harris, location manager.

952
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:59,940
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

953
01:08:59,990 --> 01:09:01,900
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:03,810
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

955
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,620
Alright, let's go make the movie.

956
01:09:19,210 --> 01:09:21,380
Welcome, welcome,
my name is Reza Borhani.

957
01:09:21,410 --> 01:09:22,760
Kevin Harkins, I'm the producer.

958
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:25,700
– Nice to meet you.
– This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman,

959
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:28,150
this is Tim, this is Mary,
our screenwriter,

960
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,760
and this is our director, Bob Baker.

961
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,240
– You are the director?
– Yes.

962
01:09:31,890 --> 01:09:34,260
Is this film a foreign brides film?

963
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,570
I'm sorry?

964
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:40,170
A film where a foreign bride
comes to Iran, but uh…

965
01:09:40,250 --> 01:09:43,490
she doesn't understand the
language or the customs,

966
01:09:43,530 --> 01:09:45,940
and there is misunderstandings and laughs?

967
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,640
Oh, no.

968
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,990
The bazaar in Tehran is one
of the largest in the world.

969
01:09:57,090 --> 01:09:58,750
[Farsi] Izar, salam, choukran.

970
01:09:58,790 --> 01:10:03,070
This Bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

971
01:10:03,110 --> 01:10:08,610
You can find many items such as
paper, spices, precious metals,

972
01:10:08,730 --> 01:10:11,610
All, right here.
Uh, right this way.

973
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,440
[Farsi]

974
01:10:16,520 --> 01:10:18,000
This way.

975
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,530
– Uh, Mike?
– Yeah.

976
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:36,320
If I was to say that you're looking
through the wrong end

977
01:10:36,330 --> 01:10:38,570
of that view finder, would I be right?

978
01:10:41,050 --> 01:10:42,470
Yeah.

979
01:10:49,940 --> 01:10:51,660
Just a little bit now.

980
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:03,450
[Farsi]

981
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,650
[Farsi]

982
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,720
Please wait here, let's uh, stay together.

983
01:11:40,910 --> 01:11:42,700
He wants to know the
photograph you took…

984
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:45,640
It's okay, it's her job to take
photographs. Production design.

985
01:11:46,050 --> 01:11:49,190
He says, he did not give you permission
to take photograph of his store.

986
01:11:49,290 --> 01:11:51,290
Well that's okay, you can
tell him he can have it.

987
01:11:54,230 --> 01:11:56,520
Please, please take that photograph.

988
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:29,670
He's saying that the Shah killed
his son with an American gun.

989
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,550
No! Canada! Cana- Canada!

990
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:45,480
Ι'd lіkе tо ѕuggеѕt thаt
wе аrе еndіng thіѕ vіѕіt!

991
01:12:48,680 --> 01:12:50,290
Let's go off this now!

992
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:14,520
How did it go?

993
01:14:16,060 --> 01:14:18,630
What about tomorrow?

994
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:21,370
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

995
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:47,040
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

996
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,890
He runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

997
01:14:50,980 --> 01:14:53,780
The six with the Canadians are coming out.

998
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:06,230
Who signed off on this?

999
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,260
You! Where was your passport issued?

1000
01:15:08,350 --> 01:15:09,800
– Vancouver.
– Where were you born?

1001
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,220
– Toronto
– "Torono".

1002
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:12,540
Canadians don't pronounce the T.

1003
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,160
Some Komiteh guard is
actually gonna know that?

1004
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:18,880
If you're detained for questioning they
will bring out someone who knows that, yes.

1005
01:15:19,230 --> 01:15:22,790
Mary, who were the last three
Prime Ministers to Canada?

1006
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:25,430
Uh… Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

1007
01:15:25,490 --> 01:15:27,530
– What's your father's name?
– Howard.

1008
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:29,270
– What's his occupation?
– Fisherman.

1009
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:31,760
– Where were you born?
– Halifax, Nova Scotia.

1010
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,270
What's your date of birth?

1011
01:15:33,540 --> 01:15:35,980
February 21st, 1952.

1012
01:15:36,060 --> 01:15:37,720
Good. What's your job on the movie?
– Producer.

1013
01:15:37,720 --> 01:15:39,910
Associate producer. What was
the last movie you produced?

1014
01:15:40,110 --> 01:15:41,780
– "High and Dry".
– Who paid for that?

1015
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,330
– CFDC.
– What's your middle name?

1016
01:15:43,490 --> 01:15:45,470
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

1017
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:47,460
– Leon…-
– Shoot him! He's an American spy.

1018
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:51,140
Look, they're gonna try
and break you. Okay?

1019
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,680
By trying to get you agitated.

1020
01:15:52,730 --> 01:15:54,610
You have to know your
resume back to front.

1021
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,860
Do you really believe your little
story's gonna make a difference

1022
01:15:56,870 --> 01:15:59,250
when there's a gun to our heads?

1023
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:03,750
I think my story is the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

1024
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:07,130
That's right.

1025
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:15,950
Hey. They made it through
the location scout.

1026
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,140
You have a call.

1027
01:16:40,650 --> 01:16:43,890
– What is it?
– Go to black on green.

1028
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,760
Go.

1029
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,490
– It all just changed.
– What?

1030
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:50,350
They're calling it again,
you gotta come back.

1031
01:16:50,460 --> 01:16:51,870
– What?
– Flight Chiefs are planning

1032
01:16:51,890 --> 01:16:54,040
a military rescue of the hostages,

1033
01:16:54,060 --> 01:16:57,580
Delta Force started training
to storm the grounds. So,

1034
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:00,320
if the six of them are brought down there,

1035
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:02,450
they won't be held for long.

1036
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:07,030
Goddammit! I never would have exposed them
if I wasn't authorized to get them out!

1037
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:09,750
– It's over, Tony.
– If they stay here, they will be taken.

1038
01:17:09,850 --> 01:17:12,630
– Probably not alive.
– Listen to me!

1039
01:17:12,820 --> 01:17:14,460
The thinking has changed.

1040
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:17,840
Six Americans get pulled out of
the Canadian diplomat's house

1041
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,360
and executed, it's a world outrage.

1042
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:24,120
Six Americans get caught
playing movie make-believe

1043
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:26,580
with the CIA at the airport and executed,

1044
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:31,540
it's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

1045
01:17:34,020 --> 01:17:36,580
We're responsible for these people.

1046
01:17:37,410 --> 01:17:40,990
What we are is required to follow orders.

1047
01:17:41,210 --> 01:17:42,710
I'm sorry.

1048
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:01,860
Come in.

1049
01:18:02,740 --> 01:18:05,700
We're ready to try again.

1050
01:18:06,610 --> 01:18:08,060
You're ready.

1051
01:18:08,230 --> 01:18:10,160
You worked hard.

1052
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,120
Probably the best thing to do
for you right now would be…

1053
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:16,110
just to relax.

1054
01:18:16,630 --> 01:18:18,070
Okay.

1055
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:19,850
You did good.

1056
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,110
Thanks.

1057
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:51,190
So you know.

1058
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:55,470
Exfil wants you to burn the
passports before you leave.

1059
01:18:57,140 --> 01:18:59,010
If you tell them now, they'll panic.

1060
01:18:59,030 --> 01:19:01,530
I think it's best if you just don't show.

1061
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:06,240
It was always a fucked mission.

1062
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:09,480
You came closer than anybody else.

1063
01:21:38,090 --> 01:21:39,280
It's off…

1064
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,420
they want us to pack up the office.

1065
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:47,230
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

1066
01:22:11,290 --> 01:22:13,320
He's late.

1067
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:27,910
O'Donnell.

1068
01:22:27,960 --> 01:22:30,940
Somebody's responsible
when things happen, Jack.

1069
01:22:31,890 --> 01:22:33,290
I'm responsible.

1070
01:22:33,670 --> 01:22:35,240
I'm taking them through.

1071
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,120
Tony?

1072
01:22:46,180 --> 01:22:47,870
Alan! Alan,

1073
01:22:47,900 --> 01:22:50,670
we need to confirm those seven
tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1074
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,890
Engell shut that down.

1075
01:22:51,930 --> 01:22:53,380
I say it's back on!

1076
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:55,640
– I can't do it, it's back stopped!
– Wait wait, wait a minute!

1077
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,730
What the hell are you talking
about, back stopped,

1078
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,110
what the hell does that mean?

1079
01:22:59,150 --> 01:23:01,910
Carter's gotta say yes
for us to get the tickets.

1080
01:23:11,990 --> 01:23:13,390
Time to go.

1081
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,230
Alright.

1082
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:28,880
– Where's Engell?
– Uh, he's in a meeting.

1083
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:30,830
Pull him out.

1084
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:33,320
Pull him out!

1085
01:23:35,710 --> 01:23:37,600
Thank you. See you soon.

1086
01:23:37,610 --> 01:23:39,010
Sahar's on the bus.

1087
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:41,190
– Great.
– Sahar will be fine.

1088
01:23:41,240 --> 01:23:43,410
– Thank you.
– Thank you!

1089
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,810
You two leave right now.

1090
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,640
We'll leave on the train in half an hour.

1091
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,100
Good.

1092
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:53,040
And he said no.

1093
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:55,160
This is not a long leisure
and it never has been,

1094
01:23:55,190 --> 01:23:57,020
and you don't decide if it goes!

1095
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:59,120
It is going!

1096
01:23:59,320 --> 01:24:01,300
Jack. You are this close.

1097
01:24:01,330 --> 01:24:03,090
Am I? Am I really that close?

1098
01:24:03,130 --> 01:24:04,560
You are this Goddamn close to-

1099
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:08,890
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1100
01:24:08,980 --> 01:24:11,020
You tell the director
to call the White House!

1101
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:12,840
Do your fucking job!

1102
01:24:21,110 --> 01:24:23,970
– Get to your plane, Claude
– Oui monsieur.

1103
01:24:29,470 --> 01:24:33,210
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first check point.

1104
01:24:33,410 --> 01:24:36,220
The first check point is just to
get a look at your passports.

1105
01:24:36,550 --> 01:24:39,360
Passports came straight from
Ottawa last week. They're clean.

1106
01:24:40,300 --> 01:24:42,430
You're gonna find White
House Chief of Staff!

1107
01:24:42,510 --> 01:24:43,770
How would I find him?

1108
01:24:43,900 --> 01:24:46,970
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1109
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:50,720
The second check point is immigration.

1110
01:24:51,070 --> 01:24:52,860
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1111
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:55,870
It says that you landed in
the country two days ago.

1112
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,910
They'll look for the matching
white one, which doesn't exist.

1113
01:24:59,080 --> 01:25:01,420
You'll say you don't know what happened…

1114
01:25:01,450 --> 01:25:03,850
and if you believe they
lost they white set,

1115
01:25:04,120 --> 01:25:05,640
they'll believe it too.

1116
01:25:05,990 --> 01:25:09,540
Jordan's in the West Wing,
he's not taking calls.

1117
01:25:10,910 --> 01:25:12,480
Where are his kids?

1118
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:13,710
What?

1119
01:25:13,790 --> 01:25:16,270
Where do his kids go to school?

1120
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:23,950
Thank you, thank you.

1121
01:25:24,030 --> 01:25:26,870
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1122
01:25:29,790 --> 01:25:30,940
White House.

1123
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:35,190
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace
Academy calling for Mr. Jordan.

1124
01:25:35,740 --> 01:25:38,130
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1125
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:41,010
Hold for the Chief of Staff's Office.

1126
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,150
The third check point is the trap.

1127
01:25:43,270 --> 01:25:45,200
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard,

1128
01:25:45,260 --> 01:25:48,280
most of them were educated
in the U.S and Europe…

1129
01:25:48,450 --> 01:25:51,420
and all of them are looking for Americans.

1130
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:05,290
– Hello?
– Jack O'Donnell from CI-

1131
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,360
– Wait, wait! Who?

1132
01:26:06,430 --> 01:26:08,490
Iran Guesthouse operation is ready now,

1133
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:10,180
if we don't have the President's go ahead,

1134
01:26:10,190 --> 01:26:11,730
they are going to be captured.

1135
01:26:12,610 --> 01:26:14,300
David, pick up!

1136
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:34,020
Zurich, it's under Harkins.

1137
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:45,430
I'm sorry sir, I don't see
you'd have these reservations.

1138
01:26:48,220 --> 01:26:50,060
Telex for Flash!

1139
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,980
Would you mind checking again, please?

1140
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:05,040
Copy D.S., confirm the tickets, go!

1141
01:27:17,950 --> 01:27:20,470
My apologies, they just came through.

1142
01:27:27,320 --> 01:27:29,020
Swisair says they picked up the tickets.

1143
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:31,510
Get the L.A. office, tell them
to be ready, in case they call.

1144
01:27:31,590 --> 01:27:34,160
We told them to shut that down.

1145
01:28:05,340 --> 01:28:06,850
There you go.

1146
01:28:23,590 --> 01:28:25,410
Not here.

1147
01:29:28,140 --> 01:29:30,320
When did you come through Iran?

1148
01:29:30,510 --> 01:29:32,130
Two days ago.

1149
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:34,360
What was the purpose of your visit?

1150
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:38,310
We are looking for locations for a film.

1151
01:29:44,480 --> 01:29:46,390
– We have a….
– Oh, yeah,

1152
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:50,640
I've got a letter from
the Ministry of Culture.

1153
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:53,620
If you want to look at that.

1154
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:16,920
You can go.

1155
01:30:25,710 --> 01:30:27,140
Come on, come on.

1156
01:30:51,650 --> 01:30:52,970
Passports.

1157
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:54,860
No passports, no plane.

1158
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:00,230
Passports.

1159
01:31:05,130 --> 01:31:06,740
Passports.

1160
01:31:16,020 --> 01:31:17,370
[Farsi]

1161
01:31:49,540 --> 01:31:50,840
We're together yes, uh-

1162
01:31:54,880 --> 01:31:57,250
Pierson's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1163
01:31:57,280 --> 01:31:58,600
They should have boarded already.

1164
01:31:58,640 --> 01:32:00,520
Still no answer in L.A.

1165
01:32:25,280 --> 01:32:26,270
Sir.

1166
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:09,630
N-No, I'm… I'm now a writer, and uh…

1167
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:12,890
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1168
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:06,920
You don't go until we verify.

1169
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:12,450
– I understand.
– Sir…

1170
01:34:12,890 --> 01:34:14,680
Call our office.

1171
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:16,440
They'll verify.

1172
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:43,200
.. It goes all the way
throughout the thirties.

1173
01:34:43,240 --> 01:34:44,010
Hold on pal, we're shooting.

1174
01:34:44,010 --> 01:34:45,380
We're just going to the
producer's building.

1175
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:47,870
Yeah I understand, I understand
but we're shooting.

1176
01:35:21,990 --> 01:35:26,640
Swissair announces final boarding
to flight 3-6-3 to Zurich.

1177
01:35:33,830 --> 01:35:35,650
Recess, back to one!

1178
01:35:36,150 --> 01:35:37,880
– Alright, recess.
– We going again!

1179
01:35:38,250 --> 01:35:41,200
Again, everyone!
And… we're rolling!

1180
01:35:41,230 --> 01:35:44,050
– We're going to the producer's building.
– Sorry, we're rolling

1181
01:36:19,950 --> 01:36:22,750
Sorry pal, we're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agency.

1182
01:36:22,790 --> 01:36:24,300
Sir!

1183
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,870
Studio 6 Productions.

1184
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:41,490
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1185
01:36:41,620 --> 01:36:44,900
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of
country on a location scout.

1186
01:36:44,910 --> 01:36:46,670
May I take a message?

1187
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:06,910
Doors are closing for
flight 3-6-3 to Zurich.

1188
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:17,700
– We can go.
– Excellent.

1189
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,680
You can these. It's a gift.

1190
01:37:41,050 --> 01:37:43,860
[Farsi] Wait a moment.
Others are coming.

1191
01:40:00,350 --> 01:40:03,810
Swissair 3-6-3, clearance for taxi.

1192
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:10,260
Swissair 3-6-3, you are
number two for departure.

1193
01:40:58,200 --> 01:41:01,440
Swissair 3-6-3, you are
cleared for take off.

1194
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:07,630
Swissair 3-6-3,
clear for take off.

1195
01:42:12,580 --> 01:42:15,920
– We got wheels up!
– Wait.

1196
01:42:30,570 --> 01:42:32,890
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce

1197
01:42:32,900 --> 01:42:34,970
that alcoholic beverages
are now available

1198
01:42:34,980 --> 01:42:37,590
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1199
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:27,170
They're clear.

1200
01:43:27,890 --> 01:43:29,840
Yes! Yes!

1201
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:35,930
They're out!

1202
01:43:36,550 --> 01:43:38,320
They're out. They're out!

1203
01:43:38,330 --> 01:43:40,150
Yes! We got them out!

1204
01:43:42,780 --> 01:43:44,490
They're out!

1205
01:43:50,400 --> 01:43:52,560
Great work, boys.

1206
01:43:52,650 --> 01:43:54,320
We've managed!

1207
01:44:04,810 --> 01:44:08,120
You are admitted to the republic of Iraq.

1208
01:44:53,340 --> 01:44:55,450
We made history today.

1209
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:59,720
" History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy".

1210
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:02,070
Or it's the other way around.

1211
01:45:02,330 --> 01:45:03,530
And who said it?

1212
01:45:03,700 --> 01:45:05,150
Marx.

1213
01:45:05,860 --> 01:45:08,960
Groucho said that?

1214
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:14,460
Called 'The Times' to nail
it to the Goddamn door.

1215
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:15,860
CIA are the good guys.

1216
01:45:15,870 --> 01:45:17,770
The Canadians are the good guys

1217
01:45:18,070 --> 01:45:20,320
And if we're not agreeing, them too.

1218
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:24,720
Only. Canada takes the credit, or
they'll retaliate against the hostages.

1219
01:45:25,770 --> 01:45:27,670
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1220
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,500
No CIA.

1221
01:45:30,590 --> 01:45:32,610
Is that right, Jack?

1222
01:45:34,380 --> 01:45:36,290
Involved in what?

1223
01:45:36,960 --> 01:45:40,170
We were surprised as anybody.

1224
01:45:42,410 --> 01:45:44,270
Thank you, Canada.

1225
01:45:44,410 --> 01:45:46,940
We knew that each day
that they stayed there,

1226
01:45:46,940 --> 01:45:49,280
the danger was becoming greater.

1227
01:45:49,370 --> 01:45:53,320
We had been looking for a solution to have
them to leave the country during the past-

1228
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:56,730
.. Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news…

1229
01:45:56,800 --> 01:45:59,290
.. American department of State
hereby honors

1230
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:01,540
Joe Stafford…

1231
01:46:02,150 --> 01:46:03,560
Kathy Stafford…

1232
01:46:05,090 --> 01:46:06,690
Mark Lijek…

1233
01:46:07,620 --> 01:46:10,430
The Americans will be forever grateful

1234
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:12,670
to our great and ally to the North,

1235
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:15,310
for the protection and safe passage,

1236
01:46:15,400 --> 01:46:17,090
provided to our diplomats.

1237
01:46:17,200 --> 01:46:18,460
– Bob Anders…

1238
01:46:18,850 --> 01:46:21,260
Here or anywhere in the world…

1239
01:46:21,360 --> 01:46:23,230
Canada will pay…

1240
01:46:24,630 --> 01:46:28,490
for this violation of the
sovereignty of Iran.

1241
01:46:28,620 --> 01:46:33,150
.. ambassador Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

1242
01:46:36,900 --> 01:46:39,160
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,

1243
01:46:39,280 --> 01:46:40,910
I'm having breakfast.
Waitress comes over to me,

1244
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:42,790
she's waving a newspaper, she says:

1245
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:44,620
'You see what those Canadians pulled off?

1246
01:46:44,760 --> 01:46:46,870
Why can't we do something like that?"

1247
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,190
I said to her, do you know what I said?

1248
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:50,780
No, what?

1249
01:46:50,930 --> 01:46:53,560
"Argo, fuck yourself!"

1250
01:47:21,530 --> 01:47:23,050
All set.

1251
01:47:23,370 --> 01:47:25,190
Thanks a lot.

1252
01:47:39,150 --> 01:47:41,910
And I left my autograph book at home.

1253
01:47:47,200 --> 01:47:50,530
His eminence called me.
He wants to see you.

1254
01:47:50,790 --> 01:47:53,320
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1255
01:47:53,690 --> 01:47:56,890
He wants to give you
the Intelligence Star.

1256
01:47:57,170 --> 01:47:59,000
You're getting the highest award of merit

1257
01:47:59,000 --> 01:48:02,680
of the clandestine services
of these United States.

1258
01:48:03,490 --> 01:48:05,410
Ceremony's on the fourteenth.

1259
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:09,520
If they push it a week I can bring
Ian, that's his winter break.

1260
01:48:10,410 --> 01:48:14,610
The op was classified. So…
the ceremony's classified.

1261
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:18,330
He can't know about it,
nobody can know about it.

1262
01:48:19,460 --> 01:48:23,310
So they're just gonna give me an award,
then they're gonna take it back.

1263
01:48:23,380 --> 01:48:25,120
That's right.

1264
01:48:26,060 --> 01:48:29,500
If we wanted applause we would
would have joined the circus.

1265
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,370
– I thought we did.
– Yeah.

1266
01:48:32,580 --> 01:48:35,990
Carter said you were a great American.

1267
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:37,950
Great American what?

1268
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:40,370
He didn't say.

1269
01:48:53,310 --> 01:48:56,030
What happened to your picture?

1270
01:48:56,270 --> 01:48:58,550
It's in turn around.

1271
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,880
Can I come in?
