1
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:40,012
<i>This is the Persian empire...</i>

2
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,379
<i>known today as Iran.</i>

3
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:47,350
<i>For 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...</i>

4
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,050
<i>known as shahs.</i>

5
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:54,733
<i>In 1950, the people of Iran elected
Mohammad Mosaddegh...</i>

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,266
<i>a secular democrat, as prime minister.</i>

7
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,699
<i>He nationalized British and U. S.
Petroleum holdings...</i>

8
00:01:01,862 --> 00:01:04,809
<i>returning Iran's oil to its people.</i>

9
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:07,775
<i>But in 1953...</i>

10
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:12,577
<i>the U. S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup deter that deposed Mosaddegh...</i>

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,743
<i>and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.</i>

12
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:20,491
<i>The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.</i>

13
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:23,556
<i>His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...</i>

14
00:01:23,717 --> 00:01:27,631
<i>while the shah had his lunches
ﬂown in by Concorde from Paris.</i>

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,466
<i>The people starved.</i>

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,972
<i>The shah kept power through his ruthless internal police.</i>

17
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,904
<i>The SAVAK.</i>

18
00:01:38,398 --> 00:01:41,641
<i>An era of torture and fear began.</i>

19
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,316
<i>He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...</i>

20
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:52,120
<i>enraging a mostly traditional Shiite
population.</i>

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,091
<i>In 1979, the people of Iran
overthrew the shah.</i>

22
00:01:59,019 --> 00:02:03,195
<i>The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.</i>

23
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:11,171
<i>It descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.</i>

24
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:18,143
<i>Dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the U. S.</i>

25
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,715
<i>The Iranian people took to the streets
outside the U.S. embassy...</i>

26
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:26,483
<i>demanding that the shah be returned...</i>

27
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,990
<i>tried...</i>

28
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,293
<i>and hanged.</i>

29
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,466
The carnival's a little bigger today, huh?

30
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:46,937
Windows are supposed to be
bulletproof, right?

31
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:49,131
Well, they've never been tested.

32
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,777
You just need to finish
filling out this section here.

33
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,743
We can process your visa.

34
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,123
We need some security.
Yes, it's your responsibility.

35
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,495
They're over the walls.

36
00:04:50,657 --> 00:04:53,433
We should all split.
I'm gonna close up my office.

37
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,383
Oh, my God.

38
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,521
Marines to Number One. Fall back.

39
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:21,188
- Can anyone hear me? We need help.
- I need police right now. Right now, goddamn it!

40
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:23,027
- Jesus.
- Can anybody hear me?

41
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,033
There was a breach.

42
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,870
Just burn everything! Burn it now!

43
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:30,804
All right, burn everything!
All the files, file cabinet, safe.

44
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,852
Let's get a cart over here. Burn it all.
Come on.

45
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,893
Burn everything!
Burn the classifieds! Everything!

46
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,096
<i>Don't fucking shoot anybody.</i>

47
00:05:57,257 --> 00:05:59,999
<i>You don't wanna be the son of a bitch
who started a war.</i>

48
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,935
<i>They need an hour to burn the classified.</i>

49
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:03,999
I need you to hold.

50
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:08,203
If you shoot one person, they're gonna kill
every single one of us in here.

51
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,085
I'm telling you,
if we're going to go, we need to go now.

52
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:23,854
- Okay, we need to make a decision...
- Can we wait until the Iranian police come?

53
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:26,463
No, the police aren't coming.
It's been 45 minutes.

54
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:29,624
- How do you know?
- The police have abandoned their posts.

55
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:32,133
If the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.

56
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:34,636
The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

57
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:38,970
The prime minister may come tomorrow, but the
Komiteh are here today. So we have to evacuate.

58
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,237
Look at me. No one is coming.

59
00:06:42,702 --> 00:06:45,444
Get the desk drawers. Everything.
Don't sort it.

60
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,949
Get it down to the incinerator in the vault!
Go, now!

61
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,054
Tear gas as a last resort only.

62
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,554
<i>I repeat, only if your life is under threat.</i>

63
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,127
In here, we are in America right now.
Outside, we are in Iran.

64
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,789
- It's on American soil...
- I'm not going out into that.

65
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,196
They're not safe here.

66
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,338
If they get caught applying for visas
to the U.S.?

67
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,440
Mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.

68
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:46,338
- If we're going to go, then we need to go now.
- Yeah, I'm in.

69
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:47,944
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

70
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:55,043
- I'm going outside.
- Why?

71
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:56,687
To reason with them.

72
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:26,414
Open the door!

73
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,314
Open the fucking door!

74
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,020
You said you wanted to see the world,
right, Tom?

75
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,250
Let me in! Let me in!

76
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:44,725
Burn it all. Come on.

77
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:47,667
Get the safe, get the filing cabinets,
get it all.

78
00:08:55,168 --> 00:08:57,580
All four drawers,
I want them shredded right now.

79
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,546
Not gonna shred fast enough.

80
00:08:59,773 --> 00:09:02,253
Grab the visa plates!

81
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,887
All four! And anything else
you see out there.

82
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,854
When in doubt, just shred it!

83
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,956
We got 10 minutes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Everything!

84
00:09:22,462 --> 00:09:23,532
Get the shredder.

85
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,232
There are no police.

86
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,077
Jesus.

87
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:37,054
Leave the building, go now.

88
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:39,281
Iranians go first.

89
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,084
Now, hurry!

90
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:56,507
Who has made this?!

91
00:10:02,802 --> 00:10:04,475
It's done. They're in.

92
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:33,140
Okay, come on.
We gotta get off the streets.

93
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,835
This way. Up here to the left.

94
00:11:05,365 --> 00:11:08,645
- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

95
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:11,972
You think the Soviets would put up with this shit?
They'd fucking invade.

96
00:11:12,472 --> 00:11:15,043
We helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.

97
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,415
- How many were there?
- At least 50. We're not sure.

98
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:19,648
- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?

99
00:11:19,812 --> 00:11:21,973
No, I was screaming his name
because I was fucking him.

100
00:11:24,218 --> 00:11:25,898
Come in.

101
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,216
<i>It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.</i>

102
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,393
<i>- I was told five.
- No, sir, apparently it's six.</i>

103
00:11:29,556 --> 00:11:32,656
- What happened?
- Not clear. We know they escaped the embassy.

104
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:34,769
- Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador's house.

105
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:39,104
- Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?
- Hold for the Secretary of State.

106
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,074
Yes. Is White House joining?

107
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,838
They claiming the embassy
was a den of espionage.

108
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,444
We wish it was a fucking den of espionage.

109
00:11:44,607 --> 00:11:47,476
Cl's got three people over there, they don't see a
revolution coming?

110
00:11:47,478 --> 00:11:50,438
- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.

111
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,081
- Hodding.
- I'll call him back.

112
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,526
They're sticking to it.
No release till we expel the shah.

113
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,627
- Well put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.

114
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,195
We took him in. He's ours now.

115
00:11:59,352 --> 00:12:01,798
Great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

116
00:12:01,955 --> 00:12:03,525
No, just the pricks on our side.

117
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:07,228
So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...

118
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,567
they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

119
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,233
What about the six
who are with the Canadians?

120
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:16,273
We've got 60 in the embassy with guns
to their heads right now.

121
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,246
The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.

122
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,578
Banisadr's saying it'll be over
in 24 hours.

123
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:27,647
We leave the six where they are.
I'll go brief the president.

124
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,088
All right, let's get to it.

125
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,756
<i>So far official comments about
the incident have been a model of restraint.</i>

126
00:13:01,581 --> 00:13:04,460
<i>Iran's Revolutionary Guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists...</i>

127
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,123
<i>blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

128
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,032
<i>It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been tightened.</i>

129
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:17,868
<i>This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.</i>

130
00:13:18,031 --> 00:13:20,111
<i>There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

131
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:25,046
<i>In this country, George Meany died
last night. He was 85 years old.</i>

132
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,517
Yeah.

133
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:31,188
Yes.

134
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,647
What?

135
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,824
To begin with, of course...

136
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,658
<i>we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the American embassy compound.</i>

137
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,199
<i>They may not understand what
their ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>

138
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:46,667
<i>But this nation, their nation, is outraged.</i>

139
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,460
<i>And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.</i>

140
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:52,101
<i>And we cannot really know what it is like inside the prison
that was once our embassy.</i>

141
00:13:52,699 --> 00:13:56,909
<i>Actions of Iran
have shocked the civilized world.</i>

142
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,883
<i>Our embassy has been seized...</i>

143
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:05,045
<i>and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.</i>

144
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,216
<i>The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.</i>

145
00:14:09,382 --> 00:14:12,591
NBC? Situation in Iran has changed,
However.

146
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,369
- Is he back there?
- Office.

147
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:25,266
What happened?

148
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:28,236
The six of them went out a back exit.

149
00:14:28,401 --> 00:14:30,904
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

150
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,777
Canadians took them in.

151
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:35,010
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

152
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,280
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassadors house since it happened.

153
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:40,685
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

154
00:14:40,847 --> 00:14:44,294
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

155
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,761
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

156
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,399
What about the White House?

157
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,195
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

158
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,393
The Canadians are done.

159
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,234
They say they're bearing too much risk. Their
foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels...

160
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,934
and told him she wants
the six of them out.

161
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:02,636
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

162
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,544
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book...

163
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:08,584
on everybody who worked there.
Jesus Christ.

164
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,914
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

165
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,116
But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.

166
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,990
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

167
00:15:19,152 --> 00:15:20,756
And they'll know what they look like.

168
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,298
Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.

169
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:27,063
- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.

170
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,339
State?

171
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,806
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

172
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,444
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

173
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,637
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

174
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:40,512
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

175
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,675
State wants the blame, we'll give it to them.

176
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,486
What does he want me here for?

177
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:48,455
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

178
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,464
Okay.

179
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:59,364
His is Bob Pender from State O.S.

180
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,436
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

181
00:16:01,594 --> 00:16:03,972
- Bob?
- Thank you.

182
00:16:04,363 --> 00:16:05,808
All right.

183
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,839
Mark and Cora Lijek.

184
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,447
<i>Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular officer,
she's an assistant.</i>

185
00:16:11,771 --> 00:16:15,014
<i>Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.</i>

186
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:19,313
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

187
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,858
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attaché from Idaho.

188
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:24,824
<i>A bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>

189
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,193
<i>He was there to sell
U. S. tractors to Iranian agro.</i>

190
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,964
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

191
00:16:31,123 --> 00:16:33,000
<i>He's smart and a climber.</i>

192
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,229
<i>Speaks Farsi.</i>

193
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,237
<i>He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.</i>

194
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,707
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

195
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:43,404
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

196
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,175
<i>oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.</i>

197
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,218
They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.

198
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:53,187
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

199
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,419
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

200
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,221
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

201
00:17:01,387 --> 00:17:03,731
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

202
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,198
to the crossing near Tabriz.

203
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,237
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

204
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:09,930
We wait till the weather clears up...

205
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:13,509
then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.

206
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:16,272
We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.

207
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:19,416
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

208
00:17:26,913 --> 00:17:30,417
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

209
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:32,062
Tony.

210
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

211
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,799
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

212
00:17:36,956 --> 00:17:39,368
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

213
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,902
State is handling the op.

214
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,300
I'm sorry, who is this?

215
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,904
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

216
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,637
Sir, if these people can read or add...

217
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,874
pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

218
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,044
It's winter. You can't afford to wait around till
spring so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.

219
00:17:57,209 --> 00:18:00,782
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them...

220
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,928
you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

221
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,963
- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.

222
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,623
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

223
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,950
- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four.

224
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:13,595
Visas for American journalists.

225
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

226
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,808
If they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.

227
00:18:19,966 --> 00:18:22,105
North American accents
gives us limited options.

228
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,270
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

229
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,849
What about English teachers
at the international school?

230
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:29,680
It's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.

231
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,480
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

232
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,791
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.

233
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,486
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

234
00:18:40,086 --> 00:18:42,794
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

235
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,628
Those kids are black.

236
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,493
Those are African kids.

237
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,868
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

238
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,703
I'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so...

239
00:18:52,865 --> 00:18:55,709
- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

240
00:18:55,868 --> 00:18:56,938
Hold on.

241
00:18:57,103 --> 00:19:00,641
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

242
00:19:02,608 --> 00:19:03,882
What's in this picture?

243
00:19:04,043 --> 00:19:06,319
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

244
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,159
- Snow.
- Right.

245
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:13,555
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

246
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,333
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

247
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,165
You don't wanna need one...

248
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,171
but when you do, you don't do it yourself.

249
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,738
You have a better plan?

250
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:33,182
No, sir.

251
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:39,318
<i>Whatever
the conﬂicting signals from Iran today...</i>

252
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:40,918
<i>and for that matter, every day...</i>

253
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,085
<i>about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...</i>

254
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,993
<i>the government of the United States has
not deviated from its basic demand.</i>

255
00:19:48,154 --> 00:19:50,259
<i>The hostages must be freed.</i>

256
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:53,267
Claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...

257
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:56,202
it violates them for all nations.

258
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,198
<i>We demand extradition...</i>

259
00:19:58,367 --> 00:20:02,742
<i>of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...</i>

260
00:20:02,902 --> 00:20:06,509
<i>has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.</i>

261
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:10,381
<i>He said if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages...</i>

262
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,252
<i>the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.</i>

263
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:18,394
<i>Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.</i>

264
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,395
<i>Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

265
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,295
<i>An Iranian ﬂag was burned...</i>

266
00:20:23,456 --> 00:20:27,302
<i>when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.</i>

267
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,737
<i>Also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians...</i>

268
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,775
They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.

269
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,436
But I don't understand
what they should do now.

270
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,208
Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?

271
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,749
I don't think that justice is the worst thing.

272
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,717
<i>When did people first tell you that torture
was going on in Iran?</i>

273
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:48,791
<i>They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow."</i>

274
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:52,725
<i>President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam...</i>

275
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,229
<i>Forgive me, his words, not mine.</i>

276
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:56,559
<i>A lunatic.</i>

277
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,726
Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

278
00:20:59,892 --> 00:21:01,235
He would've been referred to as a barbarian.

279
00:21:01,393 --> 00:21:04,101
That's why they're saying
that their current regime...

280
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,824
The shah did more for women's rights...

281
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:09,004
I think you'd better...
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

282
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:29,422
<i>At one point,
the mob cornered one of the Iranians.</i>

283
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,001
<i>When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.</i>

284
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,969
Just hit him again!

285
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,631
<i>We 're not gonna take it anymore!
We're sick of it!</i>

286
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:41,041
<i>America!</i>

287
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:46,843
<i>Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.</i>

288
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:51,053
<i>They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.</i>

289
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:54,453
<i>Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.</i>

290
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,784
<i>Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.</i>

291
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,020
<i>I'm mad as hell.</i>

292
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:03,964
<i>I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in Network, you know? I've had it.</i>

293
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:07,696
<i>And if need be, I'll bear arms again.</i>

294
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,501
<i>And that's the way it is
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

295
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,908
<i>The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

296
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:26,422
- Hello?
<i>- Buddy man.</i>

297
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,058
I'll get Mom.

298
00:22:28,214 --> 00:22:29,716
I'm looking for you.

299
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:33,188
<i>Did you do your homework tonight?</i>

300
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,094
<i>- Yeah, it was easy.
- Excellent. What are we watching?</i>

301
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:38,360
<i>Battle for the Planet of the Apes.</i>

302
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,867
Tell me, what channel is it on?

303
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:41,264
Five.

304
00:22:45,331 --> 00:22:46,366
All right.

305
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:51,540
<i>- What'd you do at school today?
- Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.</i>

306
00:22:53,405 --> 00:22:55,942
Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

307
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:57,951
<i>After school I got some baseball cards.</i>

308
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,555
<i>- Mm-hm.
- That was fun.</i>

309
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,038
<i>Okay, you know those
science-fiction movies?</i>

310
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:21,804
Star Trek, Star Wars.
They need an exotic location to shoot.

311
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,447
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

312
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:25,911
Now, imagine this:

313
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:31,315
They're a Canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.

314
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,984
We put it out there...

315
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,954
The Canadian producers put it out there.

316
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,752
That we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

317
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,429
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too."

318
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:47,128
I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.

319
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,497
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

320
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,735
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

321
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,402
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

322
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:59,276
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

323
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,281
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

324
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,320
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.

325
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,514
John Chambers.
He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

326
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:09,649
He's got an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes.
Did a bunch of contract work for us in the past.

327
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,456
I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

328
00:24:28,701 --> 00:24:32,649
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you
give me a break? I can't breathe in this house.

329
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,809
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

330
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,819
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.

331
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,259
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?

332
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,724
- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.

333
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,886
Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.

334
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,898
Some Americans are missing.

335
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,232
Look at the repaired list of embassy employees.

336
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:59,334
The numbers don't match.

337
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,411
Finish assembling the pictures from the embassy.

338
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:05,139
All I need is their faces and I will find them.

339
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,045
Yes, sir, it will be done.

340
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,763
We want you to go to L.A.

341
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:24,389
if you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.

342
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:26,259
Don't fuck up.

343
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,896
The whole country is watching you.

344
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:31,169
They just don't know it.

345
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:39,574
<i>My creation.</i>

346
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,746
My creation.

347
00:25:49,014 --> 00:25:50,084
What the fuck, Brian?

348
00:25:50,249 --> 00:25:51,455
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

349
00:25:51,617 --> 00:25:53,858
- What an idiot.
- It really hurt

350
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,225
I'm sorry.

351
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,368
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

352
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:14,083
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

353
00:26:14,373 --> 00:26:16,979
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.

354
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,593
Mr. Chambers?

355
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:26,661
Kevin Harkins.

356
00:26:28,487 --> 00:26:29,966
Hey, Tony.

357
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,284
Watch your head.

358
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,350
What are you shooting?

359
00:26:57,683 --> 00:26:59,424
Monster movie.

360
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,591
Yeah? Any good?

361
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,029
Target audience will hate it.

362
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,692
Who's the target audience?

363
00:27:06,925 --> 00:27:08,461
People with eyes.

364
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,370
Talk to me.

365
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,710
It's an exfil.

366
00:27:15,868 --> 00:27:17,040
From where?

367
00:27:18,203 --> 00:27:19,648
Worst place you can think of.

368
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,182
Universal City.

369
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,721
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

370
00:27:29,948 --> 00:27:33,225
They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.

371
00:27:33,452 --> 00:27:35,227
They're hiding out in Tehran.

372
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,692
- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?

373
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,568
I need you to help me make a fake movie.

374
00:27:41,727 --> 00:27:44,230
Heh. You came to the right place.

375
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:47,570
I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

376
00:27:47,733 --> 00:27:49,735
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

377
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,679
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

378
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,818
- Without actually doing anything?
- No.

379
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,543
You'll fit right in.

380
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,920
Let's see.

381
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:07,997
Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.

382
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:11,066
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

383
00:28:11,223 --> 00:28:12,930
Here's your director.

384
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,264
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

385
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:17,770
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

386
00:28:18,564 --> 00:28:21,773
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

387
00:28:21,934 --> 00:28:24,244
The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins...

388
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,610
who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.

389
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:30,750
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

390
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:33,082
You need a script. You need a producer.

391
00:28:33,245 --> 00:28:34,417
- Make me a producer.
- No.

392
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,925
You're an associate producer at best.

393
00:28:38,584 --> 00:28:41,622
If you're gonna do a $20 million
Star Wars rip-off...

394
00:28:41,787 --> 00:28:45,633
you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.

395
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,737
Somebody respectable.

396
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:50,133
With credits.

397
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:53,803
Who you can trust
with classified information.

398
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,041
Who'll produce a fake movie.

399
00:28:57,636 --> 00:28:59,081
For free.

400
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:16,159
Hi. I only got a couple of minutes.
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

401
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,925
- Mazel tov, Lester.
- Ah.

402
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,593
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

403
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,837
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

404
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:29,673
all of whom chant "Death to America"
all the livelong day.

405
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:31,439
You want to set up a movie in a week.

406
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,016
You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.

407
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:37,676
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...

408
00:29:37,843 --> 00:29:41,347
into a country that wants CIA blood
on their breakfast cereal...

409
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:45,017
and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

410
00:29:45,183 --> 00:29:47,959
Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

411
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,865
Right.

412
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,365
Look, I gotta tell you.

413
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:58,497
We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.

414
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,143
Sir, the car is here.

415
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,811
You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?

416
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,014
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for...

417
00:30:25,891 --> 00:30:27,837
We're gonna need a script.

418
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,906
Here, come on, come on, come on.

419
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:40,243
- No, it's fine.
- Stop.

420
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:58,860
I love you.

421
00:31:08,667 --> 00:31:10,772
Sahar, how are you doing?

422
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,249
Fine, thank you.

423
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,712
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

424
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,550
All this time. They never go out.

425
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:35,635
Sahar knows.

426
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,437
<i>How about The Horses of Achilles?</i>

427
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,080
No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.

428
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:48,412
- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

429
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,608
Hey, Kenny, please.

430
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:52,144
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

431
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,790
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

432
00:31:54,946 --> 00:31:58,450
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

433
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:02,258
<i>The cardinal wants
all cover options on his desk Friday morning.</i>

434
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:05,664
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.

435
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:09,135
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

436
00:32:09,628 --> 00:32:10,834
Fine.

437
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,466
Hey, is A006 still on the open list?

438
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,126
Yeah, I'll hold.

439
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,631
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

440
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,540
Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

441
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:53,173
"Argo. A science-fantasy adventure."

442
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:56,547
- it's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.

443
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:58,348
- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?

444
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:01,014
Why do we need the option?

445
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:05,059
You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.

446
00:33:06,885 --> 00:33:08,330
Just let me do the talking.

447
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,730
I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard...

448
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,563
but I can handle him.

449
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:18,038
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

450
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:19,834
Up like a carny ride.

451
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,033
One month, yeah.

452
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,577
- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

453
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,146
He's the money.

454
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:30,377
Look, what do you say 15 thou
and let's close on this?

455
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,083
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

456
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,726
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

457
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:38,384
All right.

458
00:33:38,817 --> 00:33:41,263
I enjoyed your films. The early ones.

459
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:45,561
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

460
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,600
Thank you. Very respectful.

461
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,270
You're finished, Lester.

462
00:33:50,829 --> 00:33:52,706
Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.

463
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:56,436
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

464
00:33:56,601 --> 00:33:59,081
They're screaming for sci-fi.

465
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:02,443
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

466
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:07,412
Well, what can I say?

467
00:34:07,612 --> 00:34:09,216
Congratulations.

468
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,924
But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.

469
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:18,863
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at
Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

470
00:34:19,024 --> 00:34:20,731
when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

471
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,963
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

472
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:26,442
Seems he was attached
to star in Zulu Empire...

473
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:28,805
which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

474
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:32,073
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

475
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,150
because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

476
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,913
They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental...

477
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,384
so the movie's kaput.

478
00:34:39,544 --> 00:34:42,753
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

479
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,758
and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

480
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,159
So the way it looks to me-

481
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,161
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

482
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,129
Is that you can either sign here...

483
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,294
and take $10,000
for your toilet paper script...

484
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,667
or you can go fuck yourself.

485
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,601
With all due respect.

486
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:08,441
You really know Warren Beatty?

487
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,350
Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.

488
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:14,319
Taco?

489
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:33,836
Got any kids, Lester?

490
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:37,043
Yeah. I have two daughters.

491
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,710
You see them much?

492
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:41,817
I talk to them once a year.

493
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,945
- Maybe.
- Why is that?

494
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:50,448
I was a terrible father.

495
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,528
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

496
00:35:55,687 --> 00:35:58,998
You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.

497
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,229
You?

498
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,063
Yeah, I got a son.

499
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,470
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

500
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,047
You're divorced?

501
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:16,048
Taking time off.

502
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,247
He needs to be, you know...

503
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:21,482
where he is.

504
00:36:23,915 --> 00:36:25,917
Kids need the mother.

505
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,019
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

506
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:41,437
<i>Listen.</i>

507
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,012
Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.

508
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:48,083
Thorough background examinations
should be expected.

509
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:51,448
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
I need another week, Jack.

510
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:53,753
You don't have it.

511
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:56,782
We got an office.

512
00:36:57,782 --> 00:36:59,887
<i>We got business cards.</i>

513
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,894
We got a poster.

514
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:06,098
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.

515
00:37:06,291 --> 00:37:08,237
Six people's lives depend on this.

516
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:13,632
It's not enough. If we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.

517
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:16,802
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

518
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:20,978
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

519
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,284
If you wanna sell a lie...

520
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,813
You get the press to sell it for you.

521
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:32,557
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

522
00:37:32,717 --> 00:37:36,665
Well, they got a bunch of actors, they're gonna
read from beginning to end. All the way through.

523
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,664
They have costumes and everything.

524
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:42,600
No, no, no, I can't.
Variety has an exclusive on that.

525
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,935
Is there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?

526
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,168
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

527
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,437
Iran.

528
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,174
Look, I can get you in, but you're
gonna have to promise me at least half a page.

529
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:56,478
No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.

530
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:02,180
- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

531
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,410
You're doing the reading?

532
00:39:03,641 --> 00:39:05,746
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

533
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,890
Great. I'll call you.

534
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,918
Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.

535
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,426
- You know her?
- I was married to her.

536
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,256
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

537
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:17,559
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

538
00:39:17,722 --> 00:39:19,167
Iran with an N?

539
00:39:19,324 --> 00:39:20,894
Yeah. We're very excited.

540
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:22,367
You ever watch the news?

541
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,268
What does the title refer to?

542
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,600
The Argo. You know, it's the thing.

543
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,540
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece,
or what?

544
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,612
No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.

545
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:36,616
It goes everywhere.
It goes all throughout space.

546
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:38,414
So it's the Argonaut.

547
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,078
No.

548
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:42,384
- What does "Argo" mean?
- I don't know.

549
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,617
You don't know?

550
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,261
It means "Argo fuck yourself."

551
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,094
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

552
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:55,796
If our artists could settle in.
We're just about ready to begin the reading.

553
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,737
<i>Argo,</i> by Mary Ann Boyd.

554
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,105
"Fade in on starship landing."

555
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,803
Exterior, bazaar.

556
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:06,812
"An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

557
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,653
The people working here <i>are</i> not diplomats.

558
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:20,295
<i>In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...</i>

559
00:40:20,451 --> 00:40:24,331
<i>we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

560
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:28,995
<i>All evidence proves
that these people are spies.</i>

561
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,835
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful...

562
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,637
our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:

563
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,508
At this time we want
to expose the hateful acts...

564
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:40,843
Our world has changed.

565
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:44,287
The fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

566
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,517
The ship is turning around.

567
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,189
Fire the thrusters!

568
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,792
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill anyone.

569
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,327
<i>Were completely unjustified.</i>

570
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:55,157
<i>They and all others must know...</i>

571
00:40:55,987 --> 00:40:58,866
<i>that the United States of America
will not yield...</i>

572
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:01,765
<i>to international terrorism or to blackmail.</i>

573
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:05,635
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

574
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,869
Are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.

575
00:41:09,033 --> 00:41:12,537
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...

576
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:17,551
but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

577
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,517
<i>"The story was told,
but there are infinitely more."</i>

578
00:41:20,678 --> 00:41:23,557
<i>Three setting suns.
The princess's robes fall from her body.“</i>

579
00:41:23,715 --> 00:41:26,559
<i>If we find his ship
we will find our chance.</i>

580
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,364
Aboard the Argo lies
my hope, my hero, my husband.

581
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,901
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

582
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:39,063
<i>You wonder where and how this seemingly
endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

583
00:41:39,241 --> 00:41:43,505
<i>What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"</i>

584
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:46,542
<i>The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.</i>

585
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:49,913
<i>Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.</i>

586
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:54,352
Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.

587
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,547
<i>For life?</i>

588
00:41:55,713 --> 00:41:59,092
<i>They will remain until the shah is returned.</i>

589
00:41:59,384 --> 00:42:02,888
<i>But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital...</i>

590
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:06,228
<i>leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran...</i>

591
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,598
<i>“harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>

592
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,539
<i>"We cut outside to the Shidoori Dome..."</i>

593
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,545
<i>holding on a single red flower...</i>

594
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,117
as it grows from the ruins
of a starship in the desert.

595
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,915
"Fade to black." The end.

596
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,924
There is it. What'd I tell you?

597
00:42:35,286 --> 00:42:37,061
First shot of the picture.

598
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,633
Argo fuck yourself.

599
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,229
Argo fuck yourself.

600
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,774
Brace yourself. It's like talking to
those two old fucks on The Muppets.

601
00:43:30,308 --> 00:43:31,514
Aliens and robots?

602
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:34,446
Yes, sir.

603
00:43:34,979 --> 00:43:38,324
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now...

604
00:43:38,483 --> 00:43:40,292
that is funded by the CIA?

605
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,090
Yes, sir.

606
00:43:43,421 --> 00:43:46,994
- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

607
00:43:47,158 --> 00:43:49,798
You think this is more plausible
than teachers?

608
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,340
Yes, we do.
One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.

609
00:43:53,498 --> 00:43:55,705
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.

610
00:43:55,933 --> 00:44:00,439
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad
with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

611
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,879
There are only bad options.

612
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,542
It's about finding the best one.

613
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:07,545
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

614
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:10,488
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

615
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,683
By far.

616
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,996
The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

617
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:26,164
Thank you, sir.

618
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:07,549
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

619
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,379
Barely claim me as it is.

620
00:45:12,577 --> 00:45:14,284
Your "in case of's" good?

621
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,881
It's just Christine.

622
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,752
I should've brought some books
to read in prison.

623
00:45:21,919 --> 00:45:22,954
No.

624
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:25,623
They'll kill you long before prison.

625
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:28,797
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

626
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,138
Studio Six.

627
00:45:40,304 --> 00:45:43,581
We got a green light. Keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.

628
00:45:44,075 --> 00:45:45,145
Argo fuck yourself.

629
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:47,047
Argo fuck yourself.

630
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,505
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

631
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:11,169
<i>This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.</i>

632
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:45,207
<i>"We are a nation of 35 million.</i>

633
00:46:46,604 --> 00:46:50,381
And many of these people are looking
forward to martyrdom."

634
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,913
- Hey.
- Hey.

635
00:46:56,614 --> 00:46:57,991
Come to bed.

636
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:00,155
In five minutes.

637
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,374
You know, she pleaded with me.

638
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:18,377
When it started in the streets
nine months ago...

639
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:21,906
she begged for us to leave.

640
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,920
She packed our bags, and I said...

641
00:47:26,077 --> 00:47:29,251
"You know what?
You know, just a little bit longer."

642
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,687
And all I was thinking was.

643
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,389
"Stay."

644
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:40,198
This is good for me.

645
00:47:41,325 --> 00:47:42,770
Stay.

646
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:47,434
"Show Newsom you got the balls."

647
00:47:53,270 --> 00:47:56,114
I can't believe I put Kathy in this position.

648
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:07,060
I think we're gonna die here.

649
00:48:56,567 --> 00:49:00,982
"Iran is 100 percent
not in a prerevolutionary state."

650
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,176
CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.

651
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,343
Can't be right all the time.

652
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:08,016
Kevin.

653
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:09,752
When'd you get back?

654
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,155
The shah escaped in a 747...

655
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:16,695
so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it off the runway.

656
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:17,924
But you kept busy.

657
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:23,128
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

658
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,096
It's getting worse.

659
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:28,209
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

660
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:33,280
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

661
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:34,973
When you leave, they match them up...

662
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,517
to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

663
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:41,646
So if they look, they'll see I didn't come
into the country with six people.

664
00:49:42,379 --> 00:49:44,154
If they look.

665
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:51,189
When you land, you should go straight to
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

666
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:52,833
to kiss the ring.

667
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,199
Get on record as having applied
for a film permit.

668
00:49:56,527 --> 00:50:00,134
If they catch you later, at least they'll be
confused while they're torturing you.

669
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,987
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

670
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,491
Uh, film production. Business.

671
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,666
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

672
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,873
I would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till I got here.

673
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:38,105
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.

674
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,797
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

675
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:05,304
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

676
00:51:05,462 --> 00:51:07,271
Somebody with one of the families talked.

677
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:08,807
Mother of God.

678
00:51:08,966 --> 00:51:11,776
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

679
00:51:11,936 --> 00:51:14,416
He thinks he can
get them to sit on it, for now.

680
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,386
Your guy better get them...

681
00:51:18,042 --> 00:51:19,919
and get the hell out.

682
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:23,658
<i>The captain has informed
us that we have entered Iranian airspace.</i>

683
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:28,320
<i>We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.</i>

684
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,216
This film crew is just yourself?

685
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,727
No, we have six more from Canada
meeting us today.

686
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,725
You like to film at the bazaar?

687
00:54:14,218 --> 00:54:16,061
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

688
00:54:16,887 --> 00:54:18,491
Landmark sites.

689
00:54:18,722 --> 00:54:20,292
I see.

690
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,968
The exotic Orient.

691
00:54:23,393 --> 00:54:26,772
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

692
00:54:27,664 --> 00:54:30,577
You came to us at a complicated time.

693
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:34,739
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

694
00:54:35,906 --> 00:54:37,146
I understand.

695
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:40,481
The function of this office is purification...

696
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,954
as well as promotion for the arts.

697
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,820
I'll review this for the minister.

698
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:49,996
Okay. Thank you.

699
00:54:58,428 --> 00:55:01,204
Lester, you're working late.

700
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,311
Till the dawn's early light.

701
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:07,347
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

702
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:10,382
Well, I'm 150 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.

703
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,490
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

704
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,155
Thank you for what you're doing.

705
00:55:24,955 --> 00:55:27,799
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

706
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,861
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

707
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,006
Ah. This way.

708
00:55:46,143 --> 00:55:49,852
- These are blank, you know. Stamps...
- Yeah, I'll lake care of this.

709
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:53,187
How long?

710
00:55:53,383 --> 00:55:56,193
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

711
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,696
And you'll fly out with them?

712
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:59,726
Yeah.

713
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:01,563
There's something you should know.

714
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:05,035
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

715
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:10,033
We don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.

716
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,225
Hi.

717
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:03,262
My name's Kevin Harkins...

718
00:57:04,321 --> 00:57:05,925
and I'm gonna get you home.

719
00:57:07,391 --> 00:57:09,997
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

720
00:57:11,628 --> 00:57:14,108
It's theater of the absurd.

721
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,835
- What are our chances?
- Your chances are good.

722
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,140
"Good"? Well, what's the number value
of "good"?

723
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:23,079
Thirty percent chance
of being publicly executed?

724
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:26,778
Can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?

725
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,185
There are no Canadians in the country
for normal reasons.

726
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:30,849
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

727
00:57:31,014 --> 00:57:34,689
They accused him of being an American
at the airport. They held him for an hour.

728
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:37,923
We can't hold up under that.
We don't know what the hell movie people do.

729
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:39,192
That's why I'm here.

730
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:42,860
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with you
the whole way. This is what I do.

731
00:57:43,026 --> 00:57:45,097
Have you gotten people out
this way before?

732
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,932
This would be a first.

733
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:53,006
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

734
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,673
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads...

735
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,614
just for having American names
in their phone books.

736
00:57:58,775 --> 00:58:00,220
You've been here an hour.

737
00:58:00,377 --> 00:58:02,823
And you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, Mr...?

738
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,323
Harkins.

739
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,323
That's your real name?

740
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,156
No.

741
00:58:11,121 --> 00:58:14,898
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

742
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:17,133
But it is time to go.

743
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:23,204
We've got orders to close the embassy
and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.

744
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:29,411
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. I'm serious.

745
00:58:29,573 --> 00:58:33,521
No, no, no, this is what, the part when
we say this is so crazy it might actually work?

746
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,520
Joe, I saw it in Burma. They get people out.

747
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,922
Snitches in banana republics?
They get them over the border after the coup.

748
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:40,152
That's your opinion, Joe.

749
00:58:40,317 --> 00:58:42,490
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

750
00:58:42,986 --> 00:58:47,093
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

751
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,828
- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.

752
00:58:50,494 --> 00:58:54,101
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

753
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,870
Pat and I have discussed it.
It's the risk we took.

754
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,580
That man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.

755
00:59:00,737 --> 00:59:04,048
And if he loses, it's our lives.

756
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:07,344
And his life too.

757
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:10,691
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

758
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:12,053
We gotta go.

759
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,025
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

760
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:24,729
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

761
00:59:24,754 --> 00:59:26,754
Who you are, what...
