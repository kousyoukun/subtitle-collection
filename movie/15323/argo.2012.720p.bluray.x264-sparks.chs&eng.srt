7
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:49,053

穆罕默德・摩萨台作为首相

他的人民却经常食不果腹

20
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,890

The SAVAK.

21
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,644
一个充满酷刑和恐怖的时代由此拉开序幕

激怒了许多传统的什叶派教徒

在1979年 伊朗人民推翻了沙王

So all our other pricks on their prick thrones know when they get thrown out on a rail...

126
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,567
就不用担心自己会被路边的兽医治死了
they won't get their fucking spleens taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

127
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,233
在加拿大大使家的的那六个人怎么办?
What about the six who are with the Canadians?

128
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,278
我们还有60个人正被押在大使馆命悬一线呢
We've got 60 in the embassy with guns to their heads right now.

129
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,243
但全世界都在关注大使馆 他们比那逃出去的6个人安全得多
The whole world is watching the embassy. They're safer than the six on the street.

130
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,578
巴尼萨德尔说24小时之内就能解决
Banisadr's saying it'll be over in 24 hours.

131
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:28,664
我们先按兵不动 我去向总统汇报一下情况
We leave the six where they are. I'll go brief the president.

132
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,085
好吧 现在就走
All right, let's get to it.

133
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:35,756
目前为止政府方面对此事依旧不愿透露太多
So far official comments about the incident have been a model of restraint.

134
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,451
伊朗革命军已经逮捕了一群被指认杀害...
Iran's Revolutionary Guard has rounded up a gang of terrorists...

135
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,123
阿亚图拉・霍梅尼的6名随从的恐怖团伙
blamed for one murder of a half-dozen followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.

136
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,044
他们说已经加强了对霍梅尼家的安全保护
It says security at Khomeini's home now has been tightened.

137
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,885
而今天 已经是美国人质被关押在德黑兰的第69天了
This, by the way, is the 69th day that the American hostages have been held in Tehran.

138
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,127
据报道人质目前的情况尚未改变
There is no change reported in the hostage situation.

139
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:25,063
国内方面 乔治・米尼昨晚逝世 享年85岁
In this country, George Meany died last night. He was 85 years old.

140
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:28,520
喂
Yeah.

141
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,194
是
Yes.

142
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,647
什么?
What?

143
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,816
首先 当然了...
To begin with, of course...

144
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:40,658
我们都想了解被关押在美国大使馆的人质情况
we wanted to learn about the hostages held in the American embassy compound.

145
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,199
也许他们并不明白 他们所受到的煎熬对他们的同胞们意味着什么
They may not understand what their ordeal means to their countrymen.

146
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,663
但是美国 也就是他们的祖国已经被惹怒了
But this nation, their nation, is outraged.

147
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:52,084
我们无法了解被关押在曾经作为大使馆的监狱里是什么样的感受
And we cannot really know what it is like inside the prison that was once our embassy.

148
00:13:52,707 --> 00:13:56,919
伊朗的这一举动已经震惊了文明世界
Actions of Iran have shocked the civilized world.

149
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,881
我们的大使馆已经被占领了...
Our embassy has been seized...

150
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:05,054
并且有超过60位美国公民仍然被押为人质
and more than 60 American citizens continue to be held as hostages.

151
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,224
截止到今天早上 伊朗人质依然没有新的变化
The situation in Iran this morning is unchanged in regard to the hostages.

152
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,610
但本台在伊朗的形势却有了变化
NBC's situation in Iran has changed, however.

153
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:19,363
- 他在里面吗?  - 在办公室
- Is he back there?  - Office.

154
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:25,285
什么情况?
What happened?

155
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,250
他们中有六个从安全通道逃出去了
The six of them went out a back exit.

156
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,912
英国和新西兰使馆都没有收留他们
Brits turned them away, Kiwis turned them away.

157
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,797
加拿大大使收留了他们
Canadians took them in.

158
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,003
联系的时候都叫他们"宾客"
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

159
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:38,295
事发以后他们还没离开过加拿大大使的家
They haven't left the Canadian ambassador's house since it happened.

160
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:40,680
- 为什么十周之前不把他们弄回来?  - 太危险了
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?  - Too dangerous.

161
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,308
革命军像耶和华见证人一样挨家挨户搜查
You got Revolutionary Guards going door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

162
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:47,767
他们中的半数人都觉得霍梅尼对大使馆里的人质太仁慈
Half of them think that Khomeini's been too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

163
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,397
白宫方面怎么说?
What about the White House?

164
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,183
卡特说了一堆冠冕堂皇的蛋话
Carter's shitting enough bricks to build the pyramids.

165
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,397
加拿大那边已经到极限了
The Canadians are done.

166
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,377
他们说这样太冒险了
They say they're bearing too much risk. 

167
00:14:55,403 --> 00:14:57,259
他们的外交部长在布鲁塞尔警告万斯...
Their foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels...

168
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,946
她希望那六个人离开
and told him she wants the six of them out.

169
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,657
- 还有谁知道这事?  - 只有他们家人知道了
- Who else knows?  - Just the families.

170
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,538
还有就是 大使馆里的某位人才留下了一本...
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy was keeping a mug book...

171
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,575
- 全体工作人员照片集  - 该死
- on everybody who worked there.  - Jesus Christ.

172
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,914
我们以为照片集在他们冲进大使馆之前已经进碎纸机了
We think it got shredded before they got in.

173
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:15,127
结果那群混蛋让血汗工厂的孩子去重新拼那些碎纸
But now the bastards are using sweatshop kids to reassemble the shreds.

174
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,010
一旦他们把那个照片集拼出来 他们就会知道有6个人逃跑了
And once they reassemble that book they'll know six Americans got out.

175
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,761
而且还知道那六个人长什么样子
And they'll know what they look like.

176
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,298
最后就只能是斩首示众
Standing room only for beheadings in the square.

177
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,059
- 谁在处理这事?  - 国务院正内部协调呢
- Who's handling?  - State is coordinating in-house.

178
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,353
国务院?
State?

179
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,806
- 他们不管撤离行动啊  - 现在管了
- They don't do exfils.  - They do now.

180
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:34,442
他们希望我们作为顾问出面
They want to run it by us, strictly as consultants.

181
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,648
安格尔说这就是个两败的办法
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

182
00:15:36,811 --> 00:15:40,532
这些人会死 而且会死得很惨 被当众处死
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

183
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,692
既然国务院要摊这麻烦 我们就给他们
State wants the blame, we'll give it to them.

184
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,494
那他让我来干嘛?
What does he want me here for?

185
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,452
这样他就可以告诉国务院 他用了最好的撤离专家坐镇
So he can tell State he ran it by his best exfil guy.

186
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,464
好了
Okay.

187
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,383
这位是国务院的鲍伯・潘德
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

188
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:01,419
他一直负责和确认人质情况的摩根联络
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

189
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:03,964
- 鲍伯?  - 谢谢
- Bob?  - Thank you.

190
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,802
来看一下
All right.

191
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,850
这是马克和科拉・莱杰克
Mark and Cora Lijek.

192
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:11,434
分别是29岁和25岁 男的是领事官员 女的是助理
Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular officer, she's an assistant.

193
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,016
新婚不久 他们几个月前才过去的
Newlyweds. They only just got there a couple months ago.

194
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,316
不会说官方语而且人生地不熟
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

195
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:22,858
亨利・李・夏兹 来自爱达荷州的农业专员
Henry Lee Schatz. Agricultural attache from Idaho.

196
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,822
一看就知道这人怪兮兮的
A bit of an oddball, apparently.

197
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,204
他在那里向伊朗农业区出售美式拖拉机
He was there to sell U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.

198
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,952
乔・斯泰福 快30了
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

199
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,992
他聪明而且有上进心
He's smart and a climber.

200
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,251
会说伊朗官方语言
Speaks Farsi.

201
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,254
是他安排妻子凯西进领事馆工作的
He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.

202
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,713
因为大使馆人手不足 所以工作人员的妻子会从事打字之类的工作
Embassy was understaffed, so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

203
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:43,424
这是鲍伯・安德斯 高级领事官...
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

204
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:46,180
是工作人员中最年长的 很可能是这个团队的领导者
oldest of the group and most likely to be group leader.

205
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,218
他们现在藏在加拿大大使的家里
They're in hiding at the Canadian ambassador's residence.

206
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,183
幸运的是 我们认为伊朗革命军方面还没有发现有六个人逃跑了
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians are aware the six have escaped.

207
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:57,442
那么 我们认为可以用自行车
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

208
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:01,230
我们已经确认了赛米兰地区的小路
We've identified back roads from the Shemiran district.

209
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,739
那有几条穿山的小道...
A couple of rat lines through the mountains...

210
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,195
一直延伸到大不里士附近
to the crossing near Tabriz.

211
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,237
因为设有路障 用车是不可能了
Cars are off the table because of the roadblocks.

212
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,949
我们一等到合适的天气...
We wait till the weather clears up...

213
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,491
就送去6辆自行车 给他们提供去土耳其边境的地图
then deliver the six bikes, provide them with maps to the Turkish border.

214
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,286
根据情报反馈他们中有会骑自行车的
We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.

215
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,422
否则我们就要派人去教他们怎么骑自行车
Or we're prepared to send in somebody to teach them.

216
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:30,425
或者你也可以直接送个四轮自行车给他们 然后拿着运动饮料在边境等他们
Or you could just send in training wheels and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

217
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,059
托尼
Tony.

218
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,220
到土耳其边境还有300公里
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

219
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,810
他们还需要一个团队专门帮忙给他们自行车打气
They'd need a support team following them with a tire pump.

220
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,351
我们只是想速战速决
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

221
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,894
是国务院在负责这任务
State is handling the op.

222
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,312
抱歉 这位是谁?
I'm sorry, who is this?

223
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,904
托尼是危险撤离方面的专家 沙王倒台后他曾帮很多人撤离那边
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot of the shah's people out after the fall.

224
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,660
长官 只要这群人识字或是会数数...
Sir, if these people can read or add...

225
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:52,868
他们马上就会意识到有六个人不见了
pretty soon they're gonna figure out they're six short of a full deck.

226
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,073
现在是冬天 你们没时间等春天来了
It's winter. You can't afford to wait around till

227
00:17:55,099 --> 00:17:57,060
找个风和日丽的天儿去骑自行车
spring so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.

228
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,796
唯一离开那座城市的办法就是飞机 给他们办一个伪装身份
The only way out of that city is the airport. Build new cover identities for them...

229
00:18:00,955 --> 00:18:03,925
你们派个救世主去把他们带上飞机飞回来
you send in a Moses, he takes them out on a commercial flight.

230
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,927
- 我们早就研究过这些办法  - 他们绝对过不了机场安检
- We've explored those options.   - They'll never get past airport control.

231
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,635
- 那地盘是革命委员会的  - 他们可以假扮成记者
- Komiteh own the place.  - They could pose as reporters.

232
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,958
- 政府签发了70多个...  - 74个
- The government issued 70-something...  - Seventy-four.

233
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:13,601
签证给美国记者
visas for American journalists.

234
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,761
伊朗革命军会严格把数量控制在74个以下
The Revolutionary Guards keep them on 74 leashes.

235
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,807
如果革命军发现是假身份
If they're caught with fake journalist creds,

236
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:19,833
他们几个不出一小时就会被处以绞刑
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.

237
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:22,102
北美口音是一个很大的限制
Look, north American accents gives us limited options.

238
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,270
我们可以让加拿大给他们发护照
So we get the Canadians to issue them passports.

239
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,860
让他们假扮成国际学校的英语老师怎么样?
What about English teachers at the international school?

240
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:29,697
是个好主意 但是那所学校八个月前就关闭了
It's a good idea, but that school's been closed for eight months.

241
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,486
好吧 那就扮成慈善人员呢?
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

242
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,847
扮成6个加拿大人去那边考察谷物粮食
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting

243
00:18:34,873 --> 00:18:36,816
确保孩子们不会被饿着了
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.

244
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,498
我们给他们身份认证 让他们看上去像是非政府组织农业专家
We give them creds, makes them look like Ag NGOs.

245
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,796
去考察儿童饥饱问题 可以吗?
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

246
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,628
那些孩子是黑人
Those kids are black.

247
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,504
是非洲孩子
Those are African kids.

248
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,887
- 我们能找到种族合适的  - 伊朗有饥饿的孩子吗?
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.  - Are there starving kids in Iran?

249
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:52,720
确实有些瘦骨如柴的...
I'm sure there's some skinny kids in Iran, so...

250
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:55,726
- 扮成传教士怎么样?  - 打个播种的名号 "播种希望"
- What about missionaries?  - A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

251
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:56,932
等等
Hold on.

252
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,644
先生 面前有报纸吗? 劳烦您拿起来看一眼?
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

253
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,897
照片里是什么?
What's in this picture?

254
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,313
- 德黑兰  - 对 地上呢?
- Tehran.  - Right. What's on the ground?

255
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,153
- 雪  - 对
- Snow.  - Right.

256
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,570
遍地白雪皑皑 考察什么农作物?
So, what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under Frosty?

257
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,333
先生 撤离就像堕胎
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

258
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:21,165
你不希望走到这步...
You don't wanna need one...

259
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:24,171
但既然来了 就不能自己下手
but when you do, you don't do it yourself.

260
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,761
你有更好的计划吗?
You have a better plan?

261
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,176
没有
No, sir.

262
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,350
不论伊朗的反对势力今天...
Whatever the conflicting signals from Iran today...

263
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:40,910
或者每天...
and for that matter, every day...

264
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:44,104
是否把人质当成间谍进行审判...
about whether the hostages will or will not be tried as spies...

265
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,987
美国政府都坚持最基本的一点:
the government of the United States has not deviated from its basic demand:

266
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,273
必须释放人质
The hostages must be freed.

267
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,283
声称保卫人权 它不仅没有保卫...
Claims to defend human rights, it not only does not defend them...

268
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,195
甚至侵犯了所有国家的人权
it violates them for all nations.

269
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:58,195
我们要求将他引渡回国...
We demand extradition...

270
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:02,747
37多年来 他依仗着美国的支持...
of a man who, for more than 37 years, with the United States' support...

271
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,505
杀戮了无数母亲手中刚足月的婴儿
has killed months-old babies in the arms of their mothers.

272
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:10,385
他说如果美方试图动用军力解救人质...
He said if the Americans try military force to rescue the hostages...

273
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:14,264
学生们将把人质全部杀死并炸毁大使馆
the students will kill them all and blow up the embassy.

274
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:18,389
美国人民对伊朗和伊朗人十分愤怒
Americans were outraged at Iran and anyone Iranian.

275
00:20:18,551 --> 00:20:21,551
早些时候 休斯顿爆发了一场游行示威
Before that decision was taken, there was a demonstration in Houston.

276
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,306
反伊朗示威者聚集在...
An Iranian flag was burned...

277
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,318
伊朗领事馆门前焚烧伊朗国旗
when anti-Iranian demonstrators gathered near the Iranian consulate.

278
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,730
导致官方决定对在境伊朗人的签证进行审查...
Also is what led to a decision to scrutinize the visas of Iranians...

279
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,775
他们明知道会发生什么 明明知道的
They knew exactly what was going to happen. They knew.

280
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,444
我就不理解他们现在要怎么办
But I don't understand what they should do now.

281
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,204
把他引渡回国 折磨致死?
Send him back, just to be tortured and killed?

282
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,741
我不觉得替天行道有什么不对
I don't think that justice is the worst thing.

283
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,706
你什么时候知道伊朗人民遭到了迫害?
When did people first tell you that torture was going on in Iran?

284
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:48,794
谁也不会跑过来跟我说 "先生 我们迫害了这家伙"
They would never come to me and say, "Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow. "

285
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,711
埃及总统萨达特 他说您 伊玛目(领袖)...
President Sadat of Egypt, he calls you, Imam...

286
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:55,221
恕我转述他的原话
Forgive me, his words, not mine.

287
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,551
是个疯子
A lunatic.

288
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:59,718
他怎么就没有选择呢? 为什么他没有选择?
Why didn't he have a choice? Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

289
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,227
他本来会被当作是暴君
He would've been referred to as a barbarian.

290
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,104
所以他们说他们当下的政权...
That's why they're saying that their current regime...

291
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,824
国王更重视女权...
The shah did more for women's rights...

292
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,019
大家最好... 请各位躲进防空洞
I think you'd better... Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

293
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,414
此时 暴民围住了一个伊朗人
At one point, the mob cornered one of the Iranians.

294
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,005
他想要自卫时发生了如下片段
When he tried to protect himself, this is what happened.

295
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:34,961
再打!
Just hit him again!

296
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,631
我们忍不了了! 受够了!
We're not gonna take it any more! We're sick of it!

297
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,058
美国万岁!
America!

298
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:46,849
就是在周边社区 民众都箭在弦上 局势紧张
Even in our little community here, I mean, people are drawn up tight, they're tense.

299
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:51,061
他们就不该让学生冲进大使馆
They shouldn't even let those students in that embassy there.

300
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:54,447
随便射杀几个 杀鸡儆猴
Just shoot a couple of them, show them we mean business.

301
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:57,776
曾在越南服役 自认声张正义的退伍军人十分生气
Men who served in Vietnam for what they believed was right are angry.

302
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,034
我气疯了
I'm mad as hell.

303
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:03,949
我就和网络电台电影频道那个人想的一样 我受够了
I'm like the guy screaming on that movie program in Network, you know? I've had it.

304
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,709
如果需要 我愿意再上前线
And if need be, I'll bear arms again.

305
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,498
今天是1980年1月16日星期三
And that's the way it is Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.

306
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:15,919
60名美国人被困伊朗的第74天
The 74th day of captivity for 50 Americans in Iran.

307
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,436
- 喂?  - 小家伙
- Hello?  - Buddy man.

308
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,063
我去叫妈妈
I'll get Mom.

309
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,724
我是找你的
I'm looking for you.

310
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,193
今天晚上做了作业吗?
Did you do your homework tonight?

311
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,105
- 嗯 很简单  - 太好了 你在看什么呢?
- Yeah, it was easy.  - Excellent. What are we watching?

312
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:38,366
决战猩球
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

313
00:22:38,524 --> 00:22:39,867
告诉我 在哪个台放?
Tell me, what channel is it on?

314
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,281
5台
Five.

315
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,369
好的
All right.

316
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,545
- 今天在学校都干嘛了?  - 没什么 不记得了
- What'd you do at school today?  - Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.

317
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:55,963
不可能什么也没有啊 肯定有的
Can't be nothing. Something must've happened.

318
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,968
放学后我拿到一些球员卡
After school I got some baseball cards.

319
00:22:58,127 --> 00:22:59,549
- 嗯  - 挺好玩的
- Mm-hm.  - That was fun.

320
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,027
大家都知道科幻电影吧?
Okay, you know those science-fiction movies?

321
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,817
星际迷航 星球大战 外景地要找奇幻的地方
Star Trek, Star Wars. They need an exotic location to shoot.

322
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,453
月球 火星 沙漠之类的
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

323
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:25,909
想象一下:
Now, imagine this:

324
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:31,332
他们是一队加拿大电影人 去找科幻电影的外景
They're a Canadian film crew on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.

325
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,996
我们放出话来...
We put it out there...

326
00:23:33,162 --> 00:23:34,960
加拿大制片人也放出话来
the Canadian producers put it out there.

327
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,762
说我们要去埃及的伊斯坦布尔
That we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

328
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,429
然后我们去领事馆说 "嘿 我们也想去伊朗看看"
Then we go to the consulate and say, "Hey, we wanna look at Iran too."

329
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:47,139
我飞去德黑兰 我们一起扮成电影制作组飞回来 搞定
I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together as a film crew. Done.

330
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:50,517
不能用太耀眼的假身份 操作起来难以透明
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided, as it increases operational visibility.

331
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,728
这比去伊朗当老师可信多了
This is more plausible than foreigners who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

332
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:56,394
想混进人群就不能穿红着绿
You wanna blend in with the population, you don't look like a rodeo clown.

333
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,279
一觉醒来就变成电影人?
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning and be in the movie business?

334
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,281
我们已经做好了教师的证明
We already have credentials for the teachers.

335
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,320
- 不 先生 我们在洛杉矶有人  - 钱伯斯
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.  - Chambers.

336
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,528
约翰・钱伯斯 他在好莱坞搞特效化妆
John Chambers. He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

337
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,784
赢过奥斯卡 拍了人猿星球
He's got an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes.

338
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:09,690
以前跟我们合作过几次
Did a bunch of contract work for us in the past.

339
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,453
我去找他 他把局设好 一两天就能以假乱真
I go see him, he sets us up. One, two days, make it look real.

340
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,642
我就出去了半分钟 就不能让我透透气吗? 屋里根本没法呼吸
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you give me a break? I can't breathe in this house.

341
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:35,966
- 我要透气 闷死了  - 你他妈给我老实待着
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.  - Stay inside the fucking house.

342
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,819
- 谁发现我出门了的? 我想知道  - 这不重要 鲍伯
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.  - That's not the point, Bob.

343
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:41,231
- 谁发现的不重要  - 是你吗?
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.  - Did you see me?

344
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:43,741
- 不  - 是我 好吗? 我看到的
- No.  - I did, okay? I saw you.

345
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,903
鲍伯 一秒钟他们就能发现你
Bob, it only takes one second for them to spot you.

346
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,917
有些美国人逃了
Some Americans are missing.

347
00:24:54,076 --> 00:24:56,249
看这个修复后的大使馆雇员册
Look at the repaired list of embassy employees.

348
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,339
人数对不上
The numbers don't match.

349
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,422
把使馆里的照片排好
Finish assembling the pictures from the embassy.

350
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,133
给我照片 我去找他们
All I need is their faces and I will find them.

351
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,047
好的 长官 我明白
Yes, sir, it will be done.

352
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,777
我们想让你去洛杉矶
We want you to go to L.A.

353
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,406
如果你能把电影这事办好 我带你去见主管
If you can make the movie thing credible, we'll take you to the director.

354
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,279
别搞砸了
Don't fuck up.

355
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:28,907
整个国家都靠你了
The whole country is watching you.

356
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,163
他们还不知道而已
They just don't know it.

357
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,587
我的主人
My creation.

358
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,754
我的主人
My creation.

359
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:50,098
搞什么啊 布莱恩?
What the fuck, Brian?

360
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,474
- 切  - 切了

361
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,852
- 傻子  - 疼死了
- What an idiot.  - It really hurt.

362
00:25:54,011 --> 00:25:55,228
抱歉
I'm sorry.

363
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,357
约翰・钱伯斯 过来 补妆!
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

364
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:14,077
他说牛头面具太紧 妨碍他演戏
He says the Minotaur prosthetic is too tight, so he can't act.

365
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,992
要是他会演戏 他也不会去演牛头人
If he could act, he wouldn't be playing the Minotaur.

366
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,587
钱伯斯先生?
Mr. Chambers?

367
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,669
凯文・霍金斯来电
Kevin Harkins.

368
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:29,972
嘿 托尼

369
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,630
人质审判的新危机

370
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,630
若不满足伊朗要求 美国人质将被审判

371
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,280
小心头
Watch your head.

372
00:26:55,823 --> 00:26:57,370
你在拍什么?
What are you shooting?

373
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,417
怪物电影
Monster movie.

374
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,582
是吗? 怎么样?
Yeah? Any good?

375
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,040
目标观众肯定不喜欢
Target audience will hate it.

- That we're not gonna make.  - No.

391

- 我当制片人  - 不

406
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:37,933
你顶多算个副制片人
You're an associate producer at best.

- It's ancient Troy.  - If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

445
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,620

随便 是拍假电影
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

还要争取?

我怀着尊敬的心和你说这些 因为我想当面拒绝你 
I took this meeting out of respect, because I wanted to say no to your face.

把白内障治治 看清楚行情

479

米高梅公司刚投资了六部新电影
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

480
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,087
他们急需科幻题材
They're screaming for sci-fi.

481
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,458
他们出的价格是你们的四倍
They're offering me four times what you guys are offering me.

482
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:07,429
我还有什么好说的呢?
Well, what can I say?

483
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,222
恭喜啦
Congratulations.

484
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,935
不过 你说的这些 我有点担心 我跟你说怎么回事
But, see, it kind of worries me, what you said, and let me tell you why.

485
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:18,850
几周前 我在垂德维克餐厅 喝着媚态酒...
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

486
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,733
我兄弟沃伦・比蒂(电影大亨)走进来
when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

487
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,986
他问候我 我们聊了一会
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

488
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,448
好像他很想出演祖鲁帝国...
Seems he was attached to star in Zulu Empire...

489
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,825
也就是米高梅公司的主打片
which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

490
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:32,079
但沃伦偷偷告诉我片子预算超支了...
But Warren confided in me that the picture's gone over budget...

491
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,161
因为祖鲁的群众演员成立了工会
because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

492
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,917
说是胡搅蛮缠也好 总之他们要医保和牙保...
They may be cannibals, but they want health and dental...

493
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,373
所以片子吹了
so the movie's kaput.

494
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,756
这就意味着 米高梅要拿下那单是没指望了...
Which means that the MGM deal ain't gonna happen...

495
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,758
你的剧本自然也就变得一文不值
and your script ain't worth the buffalo shit on a nickel.

496
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,170
所以 就凭我这...
So the way it looks to me...

497
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,176
患有白内障的双眼 我告诉你
through the cataracts, I grant you.

498
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,132
你要么在这里签字...
Is that you can either sign here...

499
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:55,303
用你这一文不值的剧本换一万美金...
and take $10,000 for your toilet paper script...

500
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,687
或者你就直接滚蛋
or you can go fuck yourself.

501
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,607
恕我冒昧
With all due respect.

502
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,443
你真的认识沃伦・比蒂吗?
You really know Warren Beatty?

503
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,362
当然 有次金球奖颁奖典礼上 我在他旁边撒了泡尿呢
Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him once at the Golden Globes.

504
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,325
去吃玉米卷吗?
Taco?

505
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,844
你有孩子吗 莱斯特?
Got any kids, Lester?

506
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,052
有啊 两个女儿
Yeah. I have two daughters.

507
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,722
经常见面吗?
You see them much?

508
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,815
我一年和她们聊一次吧
I talk to them once a year.

509
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,939
- 大概  - 为什么?
- Maybe.  - Why is that?

510
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,440
我是个糟糕透顶的父亲
I was a terrible father.

511
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,533
这该死的工作 像挖煤矿一样
The bullshit business, it's like coal mining.

512
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,995
你回家探望你的妻子和孩子 却不干不净的
You come home to your wife and kids, you can't wash it off.

513
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,251
你呢?
You?

514
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,080
我有个儿子
Yeah, I got a son.

515
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,459
他随母亲住在弗吉尼亚
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

516
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,047
你们离了吗?
You're divorced?

517
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,053
分居有段时间了
Taking time off.

518
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,270
他需要...
He needs to be, you know...

519
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,475
有个家
where he is.

520
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:25,934
孩子们需要母亲
Kids need the mother.

521
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,527
他们擒获了正准备逃往巴黎的伊朗王国安全部部长 
They caught the shah's chief of security trying to get on a plane to Paris.

522
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,453
听好了
Listen.

523
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,995
事件发生后 机场保安人数增加了一倍
Since the incident, the number of guards at the airport has doubled.

524
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,085
可能会对乘客进行细致的背景调查
Thorough background examinations should be expected.

525
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:51,468
这部电影造势还不够成熟 再给我一周时间准备 杰克
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet. I need another week, Jack.

526
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,761
你没时间了
You don't have it.

527
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,802
我们有了间办公室
We got an office.

528
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:59,893
我们拿到了名片
We got business cards.

529
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,894
还有一张海报
We got a poster.

530
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:06,104
如果我是伊斯兰革命卫队的 肯定觉得这些都是胡扯
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.

531
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,230
这关乎于六个人的性命
Six people's lives depend on this.

532
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,649
这还远远不够 想要瞒天过海 我们要搞大一点
It's not enough. If we're gonna fool these people, it has to be big.

533
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:16,819
还必须具备一些真材实料的东西
And it has to have something that says it's authentic.

534
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,997
我曾与洛克・赫德森(美国著名演员)共同拍摄过电影
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

535
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,292
如果你想弄假成真...
If you wanna sell a lie...

536
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,829
就让媒体帮忙制造舆论
you get the press to sell it for you.

537
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,543
不行 上了新闻发布会 他们会通读剧本
No, no, no. Press event and then they're gonna read through the script.

538
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:36,680
他们有一大堆演员 会把剧本彻头彻尾研读一遍
Well, they got a bunch of actors, they're gonna read from beginning to end.

539
00:37:36,838 --> 00:37:38,681
戏服什么的 一应俱全
They have costumes and everything.

540
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:42,595
不行 这可不行 名利场已经拿到独家报道权了
No, no, no, I can't. Variety has an exclusive on that.

541
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,935
有什么办法让这看起来更中东吗?
Is there any way to make this more Middle Eastern?

542
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,191
要美索不达米亚风? 还是埃及风?
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

543
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,441
伊朗风
Iran.

544
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:53,196
听着 我能让你报道 但你要答应我至少给我们半页版面
Look, I can get you in, but you're gonna have to promise me at least half a page.

545
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,483
不 这是一场盛会 一定会一鸣惊人
No, no, this thing's an event. It's gonna be a spectacle.

546
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,174
- 莱斯特?  - 你那 你看起来棒极了
- Lester?  - Nina. You look fabulous.

547
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,432
你是来研读会的吗?
You're doing the reading?

548
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,761
我扮演银河女巫瑟柯西
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

549
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:07,895
太棒了 等我电话
Great. I'll call you.

550
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,941
别让那该死的太空巫女再出现在我面前
Keep that fucking space witch away from me.

551
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,439
- 你认识她?  - 她是我的前妻
- You know her?  - I was married to her.

552
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:16,271
天啊 伊拉克太棒了
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

553
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,563
哦 我们在伊朗拍摄的
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

554
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,152
你说的是伊朗?
Iran with an N?

555
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,908
没错 我们非常期待
Yeah. We're very excited.

556
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,364
你看新闻了吗?
You ever watch the news?

557
00:39:22,527 --> 00:39:24,279
片名是什么?
What does the title refer to?

558
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,623
亚果 就是那个东西
The Argo. You know, it's the thing.

559
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,534
像是杰森和金羊毛(希腊神话)的故事吗?
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece, or what?

560
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,624
不 是艘船 一艘太空飞船
No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.

561
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:36,633
它哪儿都去 穿越整个太空
It goes everywhere. It goes all throughout space.

562
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:38,422
那就是和阿尔戈英雄的故事了(希腊神话)
So it's the Argonaut.

563
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,090
不是
No.

564
00:39:40,253 --> 00:39:42,381
- "亚果"是什么意思?  - 我也不知道
- What does "Argo" mean?  - I don't know.

565
00:39:42,547 --> 00:39:43,639
你不知道?
You don't know?

566
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,267
它的意思是 "去你妈的亚果"
It means "Argo fuck yourself."

567
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,105
不好意思 女士们先生们 大家静一静
Excuse me. May I have your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

568
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:55,815
如果我们演员都到位了 我们就准备开始念台词吧
If our artists could settle in. We're just about ready to begin the reading.

569
00:39:55,977 --> 00:39:59,732
亚果 玛丽・安・博伊德著
Argo, by Mary Ann Boyd.

570
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:02,117
"淡入 外形奇异的星舰
"Fade in on starship landing.

571
00:40:02,275 --> 00:40:03,822
在缓缓降落
Exterior, bazaar.

572
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,829
四周是中东的异国景色"
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

573
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,669
在这儿工作的人不是外交官
The people working here are not diplomats.

574
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,301
事实上 正如伊玛目・霍梅尼所言...
In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...

575
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:24,340
没有证据表明他们是外交官
we have found no evidence that proves that these people are diplomats.

576
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,011
所有证据都表明他们是间谍
All evidence proves that these people are spies.

577
00:40:29,177 --> 00:40:32,852
奉至仁至慈的真主之名...
In the name of God, the beneficent, the merciful...

578
00:40:33,014 --> 00:40:35,642
我们要向世界上清醒的人们传递讯息:
our message to the awakened peoples of the world:

579
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,527
在这个我们想要揭露美国可憎行径的时期...
At this time we want to expose the hateful acts...

580
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,859
我们的世界已经改变 
our world has changed.

581
00:40:41,314 --> 00:40:44,284
银河系的希望之火早已熄灭
The fire of hope stopped burning in this galaxy long ago.

582
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,528
飞船正在调转方向
The ship is turning around.

583
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:48,204
点燃助推器!
Fire the thrusters!

584
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,923
他提出如此强大的重力场将会毁灭一切
He says a gravitational field that strong will kill anyone.

585
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,327
是极不公平的
Were completely unjustified.

586
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:55,166
他们和其他所有人必须知道...
They and all others must know...

587
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,874
美国不会向国际恐怖主义...
that the United States of America will not yield...

588
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,759
和敲诈勒索妥协
to international terrorism or to blackmail.

589
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:05,639
长官! 我们快要坠毁了! 没有时间了!
Sir! We'll be crushed! There's not enough time!

590
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:08,892
被资本家和石油巨头控制
Are controlled by capitalists and large oil companies.

591
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,554
美国政府认定伊斯兰革命卫队为恐怖组织...
The United States government considers revolutionaries as terrorists...

592
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,567
但它本身以及中央情报局才是一直以来最大的恐怖组织
but itself and its CIA are the most terrorizing organization of all time.

593
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:20,520
"故事已经讲完 但还有无穷无尽的续篇
"The story was told, but there are infinitely more.

594
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,566
三颗斜阳 公主的长袍从她的身上落下"
Three setting suns. The princess's robes fall from her body."

595
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,575
若能找到他的飞船 我们就能找到一线生机
If we find his ship we will find our chance.

596
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,368
因为亚果承载着我的希望 我的英雄 我的丈夫
Aboard the Argo lies my hope, my hero, my husband.

597
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,910
我们会进行审判 并执行判决
We will begin the trials and carry out the sentences.

598
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:39,053
你可能会问何时 怎样 这场看似无尽的仇恨才能烟消云散
You wonder where and how this seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.

599
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:43,713
他们要的是什么? 他们说问题不在于"什么?" 而在于"是谁?"
What do they want? They say the question should be not "what?" but "who?"

600
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,550
答案显而易见 他们想要回前任沙王
The answer to that is clear. They want their former shah.

601
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:49,993
卡特和他的政权怎么好意思谈论人权
Carter and his administration shameful to talk about human rights.

602
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,346
卡特和他的政府为罪大恶极的犯人提供庇护
Carter and his government have given asylum to the worst criminal of all.

603
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,559
为了人命?
For life?

604
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:59,101
这种状态将持续到沙王回归为止
They will remain until the shah is returned.

605
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,896
但如果目前在纽约医院接受治疗的被流放的前沙王...
But if the exiled shah, now in a New York City hospital...

606
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,236
离开美国 前往伊朗意外的其它国家...
leaves the United States for any place other than Iran...

607
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,618
人质们所面临的 将会是更加严酷的审判
harsher decisions will be taken against the hostages.

608
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,535
"我们打开舱门....
"We cut outside to the Shidoori Dome...

609
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:19,545
手持一朵红花...
holding on a single red flower...

610
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:23,129
这朵花成长在沙漠中的太空飞船的废墟中
as it grows from the ruins of a starship in the desert.

611
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:26,921
画面变暗" 全剧终
Fade to black." The end.

612
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,932
瞧 我说得没错吧?
There is it. What'd I tell you?

613
00:42:35,303 --> 00:42:37,055
为报道干一杯
First shot of the picture.

614
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,647
去你妈的亚果
Argo fuck yourself.

615
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,229
去你妈的亚果
Argo fuck yourself.

616
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:26,780
别紧张 就当成是在和布偶大电影里俩兄弟聊天
Brace yourself. It's like talking to those two old fucks on The Muppets.

617
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,533
外星人和机器人?
Aliens and robots?

618
00:43:32,902 --> 00:43:34,449
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

619
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,332
你是说现在有一家位于好莱坞的电影公司...
You're telling me that there is a movie company in Hollywood right now...

620
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,289
是由中央情报局投资的吗?
that is funded by the CIA?

621
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,082
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

622
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:47,007
- 我想再问一遍 自行车计划出什么岔子了?  - 我们试图和高层沟通 长官
- What's wrong with the bikes again?  - We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

623
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,794
你们认为这么做比扮演老师更合情合理吗?
You think this is more plausible than teachers?

624
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,340
是的 首先 现在伊朗已经没有外国教师了
Yes, we do. One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.

625
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,725
我们又觉得大家都知道好莱坞的人
And we think everybody knows Hollywood people.

626
00:43:55,925 --> 00:44:00,431
大家都知道让波尔布特指导斯大林格勒战役会让票房大卖
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

627
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,891
我们别无选择
There are only bad options.

628
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,559
只能从差中选优
It's about finding the best one.

629
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,562
你没有比这更好的烂主意了吗?
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

630
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,481
这是我们能想出的最好的烂主意了 长官
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

631
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,695
至少是到目前为止
By far.

632
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:23,996
你们刚刚得到美国政府批准 得以拍摄这部科幻电影
The United States government has just sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

633
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,168
谢谢您 长官

万一出了事 有什么嘱托吗?

照顾好克里斯汀

I should've brought some books to read in prison.

639

不必
No.

640
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,640
在你进监狱前 他们就会杀了你的
They'll kill you long before prison.

641

九个月前 当街上出现暴动时...

655
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:21,923
她求我带她一起离开
she begged for us to leave.

656
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:25,931
她收拾好了我们的行李 但我却说:

657
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,267
"知道吗? 再等等吧"

659

664
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,051
我觉得我们会死在这儿

机上装满了金条 重到几乎无法飞行
so laden with gold bars, it nearly didn't make it off the runway.

672
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:17,918
可你还是忙到现在
But you kept busy.

673
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,132
帮忙运送那个倒台暴君用过的酷刑刑具
Ferrying out the torture apparatus of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

674
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,088
事态越来越糟了
It's getting worse.

675
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:28,224
所有抵达梅赫拉巴德机场的乘客都得填写这张表格
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad now fills in one of these.

676
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,263
表格一式两份 乘客保存黄色那联 机场保存白色那联
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath. Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

677
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:34,976
你出国时 他们会审核入境时间...
When you leave the country, they match them up...

678
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:37,517
是否与你声称的入境时间相符
to verify you came into the country when you say you did.

679
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,654
所以要是他们查起来 就会发现我不是和六个人一同入境的
So if they look, they'll see I didn't come into the country with six people.

680
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,148
如果他们真查的话

当你着陆后 你要直奔文化部和伊斯兰指导部...
When you land, you should go straight to the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

683
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,210
记得留下记录证明你已经申请了拍摄许可
Get on record as having applied for a film permit.

00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,130
若你日后被抓 至少他们在折磨你的时候还会感到困惑
If they catch you later, at least they'll be confused while they're torturing you.

685
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,976
你为何来伊朗?
What will be the purpose of your visit to Iran?

686
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:23,480
呃 我来拍电影 出差
Uh, film production. Business.

687
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,655
那为什么不在加拿大签证?
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

688
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,873
我也想啊 但我到了这儿之后老板才给我电报
I would've loved to, except my boss didn't send a telex till I got here.

689
00:50:34,532 --> 00:50:38,127
就算他满脑子好点子 也会终因无人分享 郁郁寡欢而死
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head, it would die of loneliness.

690
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:01,817
纽约时报和美联社发现了有六人在逃
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

691
00:51:01,976 --> 00:51:05,321
他们拿到了名单 知道他们躲在加拿大领事馆
They know who they are and they know they're hiding out with the Canadians.

692
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,277
有家属泄密了
Somebody with one of the families talked.

693
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,824
该死
Mother of God.

694
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:11,782
我刚送万斯上飞机 他去陪主编倒马戏团餐厅吃饭
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane to take the editors to Le Cirque.

695
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:14,413
他说他能稳住他们 至少目前可以
He thinks he can get them to sit on it, for now.

696
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:17,374
你的人最好找到他们...
Your guy better get them...

697
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,910
带他们安全逃脱

你们电影制作团队就你一个人?

不 还有六名从加拿大来的会在今天与我汇合
No, we have six more from Canada meeting us today.

702
00:54:11,874 --> 00:54:13,717
你想拍集市的景色吗?
You like to film at the bazaar?

703
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,052
集市 可能还有宫殿

708

你来的时间还真不巧
You came to us at a complicated time.

709
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,731
在革命前 德黑兰百分之四十的电影院放的都是色情片
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

710
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,150
我明白
I understand.

711
00:54:37,316 --> 00:54:40,490
我们局的任务就是审核作品...
The function of this office is purification...

712
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,948
还有为艺术做宣传

Well, I'm 150 years old, so you wouldn't be me for long.

719
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,490
- 大使先生  - 我是肯・泰勒

720
00:55:22,653 --> 00:55:24,155
谢谢你为我们所做的一切
Thank you for what you're doing.

721
00:55:24,947 --> 00:55:27,791
我还以为会是一幅政府官员的摸样
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

722
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,869
我想你是想到联邦调查局去了吧 先生
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

723
00:55:31,662 --> 00:55:34,006

00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,183
大概要多久?
How long?

726
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:56,191
准备假身份要一天 如果需要的话 两天也行
A day, prep their covers. Two if they need it.

727
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,696
然后你会和他们一起飞回去吗?
And you'll fly out with them?

728
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,732
是的
Yeah.

729
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,571
我有些事该告诉你
There's something you should know.

730
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,029
我们觉得我们的管家已经发现他们的身份了
We think our housekeeper has figured out who they are.

731
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:10,042
我们不知道该不该相信她 所以越快越好
We don't know if we can trust her, so sooner is better.

732
00:56:59,917 --> 00:57:01,214
大家好
Hi.

733
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,253
我叫凯文・霍金斯...
My name's Kevin Harkins...

734
00:57:04,338 --> 00:57:05,931
我是来带你们回家的
and I'm gonna get you home.

735
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,010
这些是为你的假身份准备的剧本
These are the screenplays for your cover identities.

736
00:57:11,637 --> 00:57:14,106
这太荒谬了
It's theater of the absurd.

737
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,858
- 成功率多大?  - 很大
- What are our chances?  - Your chances are good.

738
00:57:17,017 --> 00:57:20,146
"很大"? 大到什么程度?
"Good"? Well, what's the number value of "good"?

739
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:23,073
30%被公开处决的可能性?
Thirty percent chance of being publicly executed?

740
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,781
你能告诉我 正常掩护身份的反义是什么吗?
Can you tell me what the objection was to normal cover identities?

741
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:29,185
正常来说 伊朗境内是没有加拿大人的
There are no Canadians in the country for normal reasons.

742
00:57:29,321 --> 00:57:30,868
- 无论如何他们都会察觉到我们  - 记得那个瑞典领事吗?
- They'll sniff us out regardless.  - The Swedish Consul?

743
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:34,706
他在机场被指控为美国人 被扣留一个小时
They accused him of being an American at the airport. They held him for an hour.

744
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,917
这种情况下撑不住的 我们又不了解电影人的工作
We can't hold up under that. We don't know what the hell movie people do.

745
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,206
这就是我来的原因
That's why I'm here.

746
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,877
我会全程协助你们 这是我的工作
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with you the whole way. This is what I do.

747
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:45,091
你以前用过这方法救人吗?
Have you gotten people out this way before?

748
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,923
这将是第一次
This would be a first.

749
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,019
在机场每天都有沙王的同党被抓 你知道吗?
Do you know that every day they catch another friend of the shah at the airport?

750
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,681
进行非法审判 然后枪决...
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads...

751
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,608
只因为他电话簿上有美国人的名字
just for having American names in their phone books.

752
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,235
你才来了一小时
You've been here an hour.

753
00:58:00,394 --> 00:58:02,817
就让我们用生命来信任你... 先生?
And you're asking us to trust you with our lives, Mr...?

754
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,323
霍金斯
Harkins.

755
00:58:04,523 --> 00:58:06,321
那是你的真名?
That's your real name?

756
00:58:06,984 --> 00:58:08,156
不是
No.

757
00:58:11,113 --> 00:58:14,913
我知道这存在风险 很大的风险
I know there are risks involved. Serious risks.

758
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,127
但现在是时候离开了
But it is time to go.

759
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,209
我们接到关闭大使馆回国的命令 他们无处可去了
We've got orders to close the embassy and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.

760
00:58:25,711 --> 00:58:29,432
说真的 我们是过不了机场移民局检查的
We will never make it through immigration at the airport. I'm serious.

761
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,514
不不不 难道这就是所谓的不入虎穴 焉得虎子?
No, no, no, this is what, the part when we say this is so crazy it might actually work?

762
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,520
乔 我在缅甸见过他们把人救走
Joe, I saw it in Burma. They get people out.

763
00:58:35,679 --> 00:58:38,933
香蕉共和国的告密者吗? 是政变之后才带出境的
Snitches in banana republics? They get them over the border after the coup.

764

01:45:18,229 --> 01:45:22,735
这是唯一的办法 功劳归加拿大 不然他们会报复在人质身上
Only. Canada takes the credit, or they retaliate against the hostages.

1155
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,410
不关大魔王的事
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1156
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,155
不关中情局的事
No CIA.

1157
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:29,911
是这样吗 杰克?
Is that right, Jack?

1158
01:45:32,076 --> 01:45:33,794
关我们什么事?
Involved in what?

1159
01:45:34,787 --> 01:45:37,290
我们和其他人一样 觉得很意外
We were as surprised as anybody.

1160
01:45:40,251 --> 01:45:41,969
谢了 加拿大
Thank you, Canada.

1161
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,840
我们知道 他们在那里多留一天

1162
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,843
谢谢加拿大
We knew that each day they stayed there

1163
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,679
就多一分危险
the danger was becoming greater.

1164
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:49,908
在过去的三个月里
We had been looking for a solution to have them

1165
01:45:49,934 --> 01:45:51,958
我们一直在想办法把他们救出来
leave the country during the past three months.

1166
01:45:52,096 --> 01:45:54,770
第87天 终于有了一条好消息
Day 87, and finally a sliver of really good news.

We Americans will be forever grateful to our great friend and ally to the north

1171
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:14,911

1174
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,966
加拿大都愿意
Canada will pay

1175
01:46:22,293 --> 01:46:26,298
为本次侵犯伊朗主权的行为负责
for this violation of the sovereignty of Iran.

1176
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:30,684
感谢帕特和肯・泰勒 感谢伟大的加拿大
Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor and the great nation of Canada.

1177
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,234
今天早上我在杰瑞家吃早饭
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning, I'm having breakfast.

1178
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,486
他家的女仆走了过来 手里挥舞着一份报纸 对我说
Waitress comes over to me, she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1179
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,023
"你看看那些加拿大人多了不起 为什么我们就做不到?"
"You see what those Canadians pulled off? Why can't we do something like that?"

1180
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,658
然后我对她说... 你知道我说了什么吗?
And I said to her... Do you know what I said?

1181
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,193
不知道 你说了什么?
No, what?

1182
01:46:48,736 --> 01:46:50,204
"去你妈的亚果"
"Argo fuck yourself."

1183
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,021
搞定了
All set.

1184
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:22,353
谢谢
Thanks a lot.

1185
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:39,370
我的签名簿落在家里了
Heh. And I left my autograph book at home.

1186
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,718
总统先生打电话给我了
His Eminence called me.

1187
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,094
他要见你
He wants to see you.

1188
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,305
也许是想亲自开除我吧
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1189
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,767
他要给你颁发"杰出特工勋章"
He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.

1190
01:47:54,969 --> 01:47:56,812

能颁发的最高荣誉

颁奖典礼在14号
Ceremony's on the 14th.

1193
01:48:03,394 --> 01:48:06,568
如果能推迟一个星期 我就能带上伊恩了 他放寒假了
If they push it a week, I can bring Ian. That's his winter break.

1194
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:12,411
任务是机密 颁奖典礼自然也是机密
The op was classified, so the ceremony's classified.

1195
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,618
要对他保密 对所有人保密
He can't know about it. Nobody can know about it.

1196
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,252
也就是说 他们给我颁个奖 再把奖收回去
So they're just gonna give me an award and then they're gonna take it back.

1197
01:48:20,828 --> 01:48:21,875
没错
That's right.

1198
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:26,091
如果我们要的是掌声 我们早就去马戏团工作了
If we wanted applause, we would've joined the circus.

1199
01:48:27,793 --> 01:48:29,921
我以为我们就是在马戏团工作的
I thought we did.

1200
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:33,386
卡特说你是位伟大的美国人
Carter said you were a great American.

1201
01:48:34,091 --> 01:48:35,764
然后呢?
Great American what?

1202
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,769
没有然后
He didn't say.

1203
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:52,360
你的电影怎么样了?
What happened to your picture?

1204
01:48:53,986 --> 01:48:55,203
打入冷宫了
It's in turnaround.

1205
01:49:37,488 --> 01:49:39,081

01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:38,690
美国中央情报局与加拿大大使馆里应外合
The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented efforts of

1209
01:50:38,716 --> 01:50:40,004
救出了身陷德黑兰的六名美国人
the Canadian embassy in freeing the six held in Tehran.

1210
01:50:40,030 --> 01:50:41,250
直至今天 这个故事仍是
To this day, this story stands as an enduring model

1211
01:50:41,276 --> 01:50:43,236
政府间合作的典范
for international cooperation between governments.

1212
01:50:48,976 --> 01:50:55,404
六名"宾客"在伊朗历尽艰险后回到了美国外交部

Oscar-winning makeup artist John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s Intelligence Medal, its

1214
01:51:02,098 --> 01:51:06,945
这是平民级别的最高荣誉 直至2001年钱伯斯去世 他和门德斯一直是好朋友
highest civilian honor. He and Mendez remained friends until Chambers' death in 2001.

1215
01:51:08,704 --> 01:51:12,135
1997年 亚果行动被克林顿总统解密
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star was returned to him in 1997,

1216
01:51:12,161 --> 01:51:15,704
"杰出特工勋章"于同年归还托尼・门德斯
when the Argo operation was declassified by President Clinton.

1217
01:51:25,721 --> 01:51:33,697
他与家人在马里兰州的乡村颐养天年

正如你所知道的 他们以拍摄动作电影的名义进入伊朗
They went in, as you know, under the guise of creating a motion-picture film.

1220
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:35,977
但那次任务很可能会失败
But that it had a very high possibility of failure.

1221
01:53:36,143 --> 01:53:38,441
任务最终成功后
And after it was successful, of course

1222
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:41,402
我当然很想把这个故事公诸于世
it was a great temptation to reveal all the stories,

1223
01:53:41,565 --> 01:53:44,990
作为总统 这件事也算有自己的一份功劳吧
so maybe I could take a little bit of credit for it, since I was President,

1224
01:53:45,152 --> 01:53:49,749
但我们必须保守秘密 托尼・门德斯在退休之后
but we had to keep it secret. Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history

1225
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,783

Eventually we got every hostage back home, safe and sound,

1228
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:08,968
保护了国家的利益 而且没有使用武力
and we upheld the integrity of our country, and we did it peacefully.
