1
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,997
This is the Persian empire...

2
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,374
...known today as Iran.

3
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:47,337
For 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...

4
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,048
...known as shahs.

5
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:54,720
In 1950, the people of Iran elected
Mohammad Mosaddegh...

6
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:57,264
...a secular democrat, as prime minister.

7
00:00:58,516 --> 00:01:01,685
He nationalized British and U.S.
petroleum holdings...

8
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:04,813
...returning Iran's oil to its people.

9
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,775
But in 1953...

10
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:12,571
...the U.S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup d'état that deposed Mosaddegh....

11
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,741
...and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.

12
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:20,496
The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.

13
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,540
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...

14
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:27,628
...while the shah had his lunches
flown in by Concorde from Paris.

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,464
The people starved.

16
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:35,969
The shah kept power through his ruthless
internal police:

17
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:37,888
The SAVAK.

18
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:41,642
An era of torture and fear began.

19
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,314
He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...

20
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:52,111
...enraging a mostly traditional Shiite
population.

21
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,074
In 1979, the people of Iran
overthrew the shah.

22
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:03,205
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.

23
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:11,171
It descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.

24
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:18,137
Dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the U.S.

25
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:23,725
The Iranian people took to the streets
outside the U.S. embassy...

26
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,478
...demanding that the shah be returned...

27
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,980
...tried...

28
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,274
...and hanged.

29
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:34,278
Based on a true story.

30
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:38,323
U.S. Embassy, Iran - November 4, 1979

31
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,471
The carnival's a little bigger today, huh?

32
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,934
Windows are supposed to be
bulletproof, right?

33
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,144
Well, they've never been tested.

34
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,774
You just need to finish
filling out this section here.

35
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,734
We can process your visa.

36
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:49,121
We need some security.
Yes, it's your responsibility.

37
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,497
They're over the walls.

38
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,417
We should all split.
I'm gonna close up my office.

39
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,396
Oh, my God.

40
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:17,524
Marines to Number One. Fall back.

41
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:21,194
- Can anyone hear me? We need help.
- I need police right now. Right now, goddamn it!

42
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,030
- Jesus.
- Can anybody hear me?

43
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,032
There was a breach.

44
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,868
Just burn everything! Burn it now!

45
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,787
All right, burn everything!
All the files, file cabinet, safe.

46
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,846
Let's get a cart over here. Burn it all.
Come on.

47
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,891
Burn everything!
Burn the classifieds! Everything!

48
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,105
Don't fucking shoot anybody.

49
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,983
You don't wanna be the son of a bitch
who started a war.

50
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,943
They need an hour to burn the classified.

51
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:03,987
I need you to hold.

52
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:08,200
If you shoot one person, they're gonna kill
every single one of us in here.

53
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,087
I'm telling you,
if we're going to go, we need to go now.

54
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,840
- Okay, we need to make a decision--
- Can we wait until the Iranian police come?

55
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:26,468
No, the police aren't coming.
It's been 45 minutes.

56
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,638
- How do you know?
- The police have abandoned their posts.

57
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,140
If the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.

58
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:34,643
The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

59
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:38,980
The prime minister may come tomorrow, but the
Komiteh are here today. So we have to evacuate.

60
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,233
Look at me. No one is coming.

61
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,445
Get the desk drawers. Everything.
Don't sort it.

62
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,948
Get it down to the incinerator in the vault!
Go, now!

63
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,033
Tear gas as a last resort only.

64
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:52,536
only if your life is under threat.

65
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,118
In here, we are in America right now.
Outside, we are in Iran.

66
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,787
- It's on American soil--
- I'm not going out into that.

67
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,205
They're not safe here.

68
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,333
If they get caught applying for visas
to the U.S.?

69
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,420
Mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.

70
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:46,339
- If we're going to go, then we need to go now.
- Yeah, I'm in.

71
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,924
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

72
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,056
- I'm going outside.
- Why?

73
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,683
To reason with them.

74
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,421
Open the door!

75
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,298
Open the fucking door!

76
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:33,011
You said you wanted to see the world,
right, Tom?

77
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,263
Let me in! Let me in!

78
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,731
Burn it all. Come on.

79
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:47,651
Get the safe, get the filing cabinets,
get it all.

80
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:57,577
All four drawers,
I want them shredded right now.

81
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,538
Not gonna shred fast enough.

82
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,249
Grab the visa plates!

83
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,877
All four! And anything else
you see out there.

84
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,837
When in doubt, just shred it!

85
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,968
We got 10 minutes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Everything!

86
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:23,520
Get the shredder.

87
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,230
There are no police.

88
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,071
Jesus.

89
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:37,033
Leave the building, go now.

90
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,286
Iranians go first.

91
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,079
Now, hurry!

92
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,511
Who has made this?!

93
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,477
It's done. They're in.

94
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:33,131
Okay, come on.
We gotta get off the streets.

95
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:34,841
This way. Up here to the left.

96
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:06,539
- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

97
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,708
- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.
STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

98
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:08,875
STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

99
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,961
You think the Soviets would put up
with this shit? They'd invade.
STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

100
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:12,295
You think the Soviets would put up
with this shit? They'd invade.

101
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:15,048
We helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.

102
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,425
- How many were there?
- At least 50. We're not sure.

103
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,636
- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?

104
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:21,680
No, I was screaming his name
because I was fucking him.

105
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:24,224
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

106
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,225
Come in.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

107
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:25,392
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

108
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,976
It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

109
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:27,060
It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.

110
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,396
- I was told five.
- No, sir, apparently it's six.

111
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:29,771
- What happened?
- Not clear. We know they escaped.

112
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,899
What happened?
- Not clear. We know they escaped.
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

113
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,066
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

114
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:33,733
Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador's house.
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

115
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,235
- Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador's house.

116
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:39,114
- Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?
- Hold for the Secretary of State.

117
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:41,074
Yes. Is White House joining?

118
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,826
They claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.

119
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:43,576
We wish it was.

120
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:44,452
We wish it was.
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE

121
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:44,619
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE

122
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,789
Cl's got three people over there,
they don't see a revolution coming?
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE

123
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:47,956
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE

124
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:48,623
- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE

125
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,291
- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.

126
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,085
- Hodding.
- I'll call him back.

127
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,379
They're sticking.
No release till we expel the shah.

128
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,590
- Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.

129
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,175
We took him in. He's ours now.

130
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,803
Great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

131
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,513
No, just the pricks on our side.

132
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:07,225
So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...

133
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,562
...they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

134
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,231
What about the six
who are with the Canadians?

135
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:16,276
We've got 60 in the embassy with guns
to their heads right now.

136
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,237
The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.

137
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,573
Banisadr's saying it'll be over
in 24 hours.

138
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,662
We leave the six where they are.
I'll go brief the president.

139
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,083
All right, let's get to it.

140
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,754
So far official comments about
the incident have been a model of restraint.

141
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,892
69 DAYS LATER

142
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,449
Iran's Revolutionary Guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists...

143
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:09,120
...blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.

144
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:13,041
It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been tightened.

145
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:17,879
This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.

146
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,089
There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.

147
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,053
In this country, George Meany died
last night. He was 85 years old.

148
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,515
Yeah.

149
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:31,184
Yes.

150
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:34,646
What?

151
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,815
To begin with, of course...

152
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,652
...we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the American embassy compound.

153
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,197
They may not understand what
their ordeal means to their countrymen.

154
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,658
But this nation, their nation, is outraged.

155
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:47,450
And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.

156
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,286
And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIA

157
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,288
And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.

158
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:56,918
Actions of Iran
have shocked the civilized world.

159
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,879
Our embassy has been seized...

160
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:05,051
...and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.

161
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:09,222
The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.

162
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,600
NBC's situation in Iran has changed,
however.

163
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:19,357
- Is he back there?
- Office.

164
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,280
What happened?

165
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,241
The six of them went out a back exit.

166
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,910
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

167
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,787
Canadians took them in.

168
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,998
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

169
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,293
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.

170
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,670
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

171
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:44,299
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

172
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,760
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

173
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,387
What about the White House?

174
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,181
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

175
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,391
The Canadians are done.

176
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:57,228
They say they're bearing too much risk. Their
foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels. ..

177
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,939
...and told him she wants
the six of them out.

178
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,650
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

179
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,528
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book. ..

180
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:08,573
- ...on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.

181
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,909
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

182
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:15,121
But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.

183
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:19,000
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

184
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,752
And they'll know what they look like.

185
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,296
Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.

186
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:27,050
- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.

187
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,344
State?

188
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,804
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

189
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:34,432
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

190
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,643
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

191
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:40,521
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

192
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,690
State wants the blame, we'll give it to them.

193
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,485
What does he want me here for?

194
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,446
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

195
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,454
Okay.

196
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,374
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

197
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,417
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

198
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,962
- Bob?
- Thank you.

199
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,797
All right.

200
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,840
Mark and Cora Lijek.

201
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:11,427
Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular officer,
she's an assistant.

202
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:15,014
Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.

203
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,310
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

204
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:22,855
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attaché from Idaho.

205
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,816
A bit of an oddball, apparently.

206
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,194
He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.

207
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,947
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

208
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,991
He's smart and a climber.

209
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,242
Speaks Farsi.

210
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,245
He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.

211
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:40,707
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

212
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:43,418
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

213
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:46,170
...oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.

214
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:49,215
They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.

215
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:53,177
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

216
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:57,432
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

217
00:16:58,225 --> 00:17:01,227
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

218
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,730
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

219
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,189
...to the crossing near Tabriz.

220
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,234
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

221
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:09,944
We wait till the weather clears up...

222
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:13,489
...then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.

223
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:16,284
We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.

224
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,412
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

225
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,423
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

226
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,050
Tony.

227
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,218
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

228
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:36,804
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

229
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:39,348
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

230
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,892
State is handling the op.

231
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,310
I'm sorry, who is this?

232
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,898
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

233
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,650
Sir, if these people can read or add...

234
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,862
...pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

235
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:57,033
It's winter. You can't afford to wait around till
spring so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.

236
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,787
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them. ..

237
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:03,915
...you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

238
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,918
- We've explored those options.
- They'll never get past airport control.

239
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,629
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

240
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,839
- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four.

241
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:13,591
...visas for American journalists.

242
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,760
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

243
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,806
If they're caught with fake journalist creds,
it's Peter Jennings' head in a noose in an hour.

244
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,100
North American accents
gives us limited options.

245
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:24,268
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

246
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,854
What about English teachers
at the international school?

247
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,690
It's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.

248
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,484
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

249
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:36,781
Six Canadians have been over there inspecting
crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.

250
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,492
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

251
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,787
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

252
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,622
Those kids are black.

253
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,499
Those are African kids.

254
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,877
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

255
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:52,713
I'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so.. ..

256
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,716
- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

257
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:56,926
Hold on.

258
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,638
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

259
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,891
What's in this picture?

260
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,310
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

261
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,148
- Snow.
- Right.

262
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,568
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

263
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,323
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

264
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,159
You don't wanna need one...

265
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,162
...but when you do, you don't do it yourself.

266
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,751
You have a better plan?

267
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,171
No, sir.

268
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:39,302
Whatever
the conflicting signals from Iran today...

269
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:40,887
...and for that matter, every day...

270
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,098
...about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...

271
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:47,977
...the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:

272
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:50,271
The hostages must be freed.

273
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,274
--claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...

274
00:19:53,442 --> 00:19:56,194
...it violates them for all nations.

275
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,570
We demand extradition...

276
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,196
We demand extradition...
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

277
00:19:58,197 --> 00:19:58,362
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

278
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,450
...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

279
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:02,742
...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...

280
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,495
...has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.

281
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,374
He said if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages...

282
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:14,253
...the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.

283
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:18,382
Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.

284
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:21,385
Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.

285
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,304
An Iranian flag was burned...

286
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,308
...when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.

287
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,728
--also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians....

288
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:33,773
They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.

289
00:20:33,941 --> 00:20:36,442
But I don't understand
what they should do now.

290
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,195
Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?

291
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,739
I don't think that justice is the worst thing.

292
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,700
When did people first tell you that torture
was going on in Iran?

293
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,788
They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow."

294
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,708
President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam--

295
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,211
Forgive me, his words, not mine.

296
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:56,545
--a lunatic.

297
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,715
Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

298
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,217
He would've been referred to as a barbarian.

299
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,095
That's why they're saying
that their current regime.. ..

300
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,721
The shah did more for women's rights--

301
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:09,016
I think you'd better--
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

302
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,412
At one point,
the mob cornered one of the Iranians.

303
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:32,999
When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.

304
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:34,959
Just hit him again!

305
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:38,629
We're not gonna take it anymore!
We're sick of it!

306
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,048
America!

307
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:46,846
Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.

308
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:51,058
They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.

309
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:54,437
Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.

310
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,773
Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.

311
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,025
I'm mad as hell.

312
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:03,946
I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in Network, you know? I've had it.

313
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,700
And if need be, I'll bear arms again.

314
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:11,495
And that's the way it is
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.

315
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,916
The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.

316
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,427
- Hello?
- Buddy man.

317
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,054
I'll get Mom.

318
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,722
I'm looking for you.

319
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,184
Did you do your homework tonight?

320
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:36,103
- Yeah, it was easy.
- Excellent. What are we watching?

321
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,356
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

322
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,857
Tell me, what channel is it on?

323
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,275
Five.

324
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,364
All right.

325
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,535
- What'd you do at school today?
- Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.

326
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,956
Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

327
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:57,958
After school I got some baseball cards.

328
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,543
- Mm-hm.
- That was fun.

329
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:19,021
Okay, you know those
science-fiction movies?

330
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,816
Star Trek, Star Wars.
They need an exotic location to shoot.

331
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,443
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

332
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,903
Now, imagine this:

333
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,325
They're a Canadian film crew
on a location scout for a science-fiction movie.

334
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,993
We put it out there--

335
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:34,954
The Canadian producers put it out there.

336
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,747
--that we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

337
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:42,420
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too."

338
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:47,133
I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.

339
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,511
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

340
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,722
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

341
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,392
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

342
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,270
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

343
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,272
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

344
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,232
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.

345
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,526
John Chambers.
He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

346
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:09,655
He's got an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes.
Did a bunch of contract work for us in the past.

347
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,451
I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

348
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:32,636
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you
give me a break? I can't breathe in this house.

349
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,806
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

350
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,809
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.

351
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,228
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?

352
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,731
- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.

353
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,901
Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.

354
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,908
Sοme Americans are missing.

355
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,243
Lοοk at the repaired list οf embassy emplοyees.

356
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:59,330
Τhe numbers dοn't match.

357
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,416
Finish assembling the pictures frοm the embassy.

358
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,127
All I need is their faces and I will find them.

359
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:07,046
Yes, sir, it will be dοne.

360
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,768
We want you to go to L.A.

361
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:24,396
If you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.

362
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,273
Don't fuck up.

363
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,901
The whole country is watching you.

364
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:31,153
They just don't know it.

365
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,578
My creation.

366
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,748
My creation.

367
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,089
What the fuck, Brian?

368
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,465
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

369
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,842
- What an idiot.
- It really hurt.

370
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,219
I'm sorry.

371
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,347
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

372
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:04,311
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

373
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:14,071
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

374
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,991
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.

375
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,582
Mr. Chambers?

376
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,667
Kevin Harkins.

377
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:29,962
Hey, Tony.

378
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,279
Watch your head.

379
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,364
What are you shooting?

380
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,408
Monster movie.

381
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,577
Yeah? Any good?

382
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,039
Target audience will hate it.

383
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,707
Who's the target audience?

384
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,459
People with eyes.

385
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,379
Talk to me.

386
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,716
It's an exfil.

387
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,051
From where?

388
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,637
Worst place you can think of.

389
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,180
Universal City.

390
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:29,730
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

391
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:33,233
They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.

392
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:35,235
They're hiding out in Tehran.

393
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:38,697
- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?

394
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,575
I need you to help me make a fake movie.

395
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,244
Heh. You came to the right place.

396
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:47,581
I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

397
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,750
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

398
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,670
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

399
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,797
- Without actually doing anything?
- No.

400
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,548
You'll fit right in.

401
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:03,931
Let's see.

402
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:07,976
Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.

403
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:11,063
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

404
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,940
Here's your director.

405
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:15,275
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

406
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,778
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

407
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,782
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

408
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,243
The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins...

409
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,620
...who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.

410
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,749
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

411
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,085
You need a script. You need a producer.

412
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,420
- Make me a producer.
- No.

413
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,923
You're an associate producer at best.

414
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:41,635
If you're gonna do a $20 million
Star Wars rip-off...

415
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,639
...you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.

416
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,725
Somebody respectable.

417
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,144
With credits.

418
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:53,814
Who you can trust
with classified information.

419
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,025
Who'll produce a fake movie.

420
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,069
For free.

421
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:16,170
Hi. I only got a couple of minutes.
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

422
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,921
- Mazel tov, Lester.
- Ah.

423
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,591
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

424
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:25,846
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

425
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:29,683
...all of whom chant "Death to America"
all the livelong day.

426
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,435
You want to set up a movie in a week.

427
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:35,022
You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.

428
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,691
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here. ..

429
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,361
...into a country that wants CIA blood
on their breakfast cereal. ..

430
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,032
...and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

431
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,951
Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

432
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:50,871
Right.

433
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,374
Look, I gotta tell you.

434
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:58,504
We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.

435
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,130
Sir, the car is here.

436
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,808
You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?

437
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:14,019
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for--

438
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,825
We're gonna need a script.

439
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,919
Here, come on, come on, come on.

440
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,254
- No, it's fine.
- Stop.

441
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,594
Okay.

442
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,856
I love you.

443
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,784
Sahar, how are you doing?

444
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,245
Fine, thank you.

445
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,707
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

446
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:20,544
All this time. They never go out.

447
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,642
Sahar knows.

448
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,440
How about The Horses of Achilles?

449
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,067
No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.

450
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:48,405
- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

451
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,615
Hey, Kenny, please.

452
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,159
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

453
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,786
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

454
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:58,457
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

455
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,252
The cardinal wants
all cover options on his desk Friday morning.

456
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,672
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.

457
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,134
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

458
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,844
Fine.

459
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,456
Hey, is A006 still on the open list?

460
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,124
Yeah, I'll hold.

461
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:45,629
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.

462
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:49,549
Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

463
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,178
Argo. A science-fantasy adventure."

464
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,556
- It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.

465
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,350
- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?

466
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,019
Why do we need the option?

467
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:05,065
You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.

468
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,318
Just let me do the talking.

469
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,738
I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard...

470
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,573
...but I can handle him.

471
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,036
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

472
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,830
Up like a carny ride.

473
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,039
One month, yeah.

474
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,583
- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

475
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,127
He's the money.

476
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:30,382
Look, what do you say 15 thou
and let's close on this?

477
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,094
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

478
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,722
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

479
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,390
All right.

480
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,268
I enjoyed your films. The early ones.

481
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:45,564
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

482
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:48,608
Thank you. Very respectful.

483
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,277
You're finished, Lester.

484
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,696
Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.

485
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:56,450
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

486
00:33:56,617 --> 00:33:59,077
They're screaming for sci-fi.

487
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:02,456
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

488
00:34:03,958 --> 00:34:07,419
Well, what can I say?

489
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,212
Congratulations.

490
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:13,925
But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.

491
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:18,847
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at
Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

492
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:20,724
...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

493
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,976
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

494
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:26,438
Seems he was attached
to star in Zulu Empire...

495
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,815
...which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

496
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,069
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

497
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:35,155
...because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

498
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,908
They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental...

499
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,367
...so the movie's kaput.

500
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,746
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

501
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:45,749
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

502
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:48,168
So the way it looks to me--

503
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:50,170
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

504
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,130
--is that you can either sign here...

505
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:55,300
...and take $10,000
for your toilet paper script...

506
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,677
...or you can go fuck yourself.

507
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,597
With all due respect.

508
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,438
You really know Warren Beatty?

509
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:12,359
Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.

510
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,319
Taco?

511
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:33,839
Got any kids, Lester?

512
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,050
Yeah. I have two daughters.

513
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,719
You see them much?

514
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,805
I talk to them once a year.

515
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,933
- Maybe.
- Why is that?

516
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,438
I was a terrible father.

517
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:55,527
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

518
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,989
You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.

519
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,242
You?

520
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,078
Yeah, I got a son.

521
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,456
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

522
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,045
You're divorced?

523
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,047
Taking time off.

524
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,260
He needs to be, you know. ..

525
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,469
...where he is.

526
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,932
Kids need the mother.

527
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,319
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

528
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,448
Listen.

529
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,993
Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.

530
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,079
Thorough background examinations
should be expected.

531
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,458
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
I need another week, Jack.

532
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,752
You don't have it.

533
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,796
We got an office.

534
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,883
We got business cards.

535
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,885
We got a poster.

536
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,097
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard,
that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.

537
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:08,225
Six people's lives depend on this.

538
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:13,647
It's not enough. If we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.

539
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,816
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

540
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,987
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

541
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,282
If you wanna sell a lie....

542
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,827
You get the press to sell it for you.

543
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:32,540
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

544
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:36,670
Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.

545
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,672
They have costumes and everything.

546
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:42,592
No, no, no, I can't.
Variety has an exclusive on that.

547
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,929
Is there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?

548
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,181
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

549
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:49,432
Iran.

550
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:53,186
Look, I can get you in, but you're
gonna have to promise me at least half a page.

551
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:56,481
No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.

552
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:02,172
- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

553
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,423
You're doing the reading?

554
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,759
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

555
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,886
Great. I'll call you.

556
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,931
Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.

557
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,434
- You know her?
- I was married to her.

558
00:39:14,643 --> 00:39:16,269
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

559
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,562
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

560
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,147
Iran with an N?

561
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,899
Yeah. We're very excited.

562
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,359
You ever watch the news?

563
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,277
What does the title refer to?

564
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,614
The Argo. You know, it's the thing.

565
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,532
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece,
or what?

566
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,618
No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.

567
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:36,623
It goes everywhere.
It goes all throughout space.

568
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:38,416
So it's the Argonaut.

569
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,085
No.

570
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,379
- What does "Argo" mean?
- I don't know.

571
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,630
You don't know?

572
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,257
It means "Argo fuck yourself."

573
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:51,096
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

574
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:55,809
If our artists could settle in.
We're just about ready to begin the reading.

575
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:59,729
Argo, by Mary Ann Boyd.

576
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:02,107
"Fade in on starship landing.

577
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,817
Exterior, bazaar.

578
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,820
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

579
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,664
The people working here are not diplomats.

580
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,291
In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...

581
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:24,337
...we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.

582
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:29,008
All evidence proves
that these people are spies.

583
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:32,846
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful...

584
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:35,640
...our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:

585
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:38,518
At this time we want
to expose the hateful acts. ...

586
00:40:38,686 --> 00:40:40,854
Our world has changed.

587
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,274
The fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

588
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:46,526
The ship is turning around.

589
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,194
Fire the thrusters!

590
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:50,780
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill anyone.

591
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,324
--were completely unjustified.

592
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,160
They and all others must know...

593
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,872
...that the United States of America
will not yield...

594
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:01,749
...to international terrorism or to blackmail.

595
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:05,628
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

596
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:08,882
--are controlled by capitalists
and large oil companies.

597
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,552
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...

598
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:17,557
...but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

599
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:20,518
"The story was told,
but there are infinitely more.

600
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,563
Three setting suns.
The princess's robes fall from her body."

601
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,566
If we find his ship
we will find our chance.

602
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,362
Aboard the Argo lies
my hope, my hero, my husband.

603
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,908
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

604
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:38,953
You wonder where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.

605
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:39,078
You wonder where and how this
seemingly endless parade of hatred will end.
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

606
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,245
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

607
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:43,041
What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"
EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980

608
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:43,708
What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"

609
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,544
The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.

610
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:49,923
--Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.

611
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:54,344
Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.

612
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:55,553
For life?

613
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:59,098
They will remain until the shah is returned.

614
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,894
But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital...

615
00:42:03,062 --> 00:42:06,231
...leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran...

616
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,608
...harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.

617
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:17,534
"We cut outside to the Shidoori Dome...

618
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,536
...holding on a single red flower...

619
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,122
...as it grows from the ruins
of a starship in the desert.

620
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,918
Fade to black." The end.

621
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,926
There is it. What'd I tell you?

622
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,053
First shot of the picture.

623
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,642
Argo fuck yourself.

624
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,228
Argo fuck yourself.

625
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:08,835
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

626
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:10,628
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

627
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:26,769
Brace yourself. It's like talking to
those two old fucks on The Muppets.

628
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:31,524
Aliens and robots?

629
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,444
Yes, sir.

630
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,323
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now...

631
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,283
...that is funded by the CIA?

632
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,076
Yes, sir.

633
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,998
- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

634
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,792
You think this is more plausible
than teachers?

635
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:53,338
Yes, we do.
One, there are no more foreign teachers in Iran.

636
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,715
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.

637
00:43:55,924 --> 00:44:00,428
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad
with Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

638
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,889
There are only bad options.

639
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,557
It's about finding the best one.

640
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,560
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

641
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:10,480
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

642
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,689
By far.

643
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,993
The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

644
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,162
Thank you, sir.

645
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:07,537
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

646
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,373
Barely claim me as it is.

647
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,293
Your "in case of's" good?

648
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,879
It's just Christine.

649
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:21,759
I should've brought some books
to read in prison.

650
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:22,969
No.

651
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:25,638
They'll kill you long before prison.

652
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:28,808
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

653
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,153
Studio Six.

654
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,573
We got a green light. Keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.

655
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:47,034
Argo fuck yourself.

656
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,513
Your attention, please.

657
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:11,184
This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.

658
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:45,218
"We are a nation of 35 million.

659
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:50,389
And many of these people are looking
forward to martyrdom."

660
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,895
- Hey.
- Hey.

661
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,980
Come to bed.

662
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,149
In five minutes.

663
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,372
You know, she pleaded with me.

664
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:18,376
When it started in the streets
nine months ago...

665
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,921
...she begged for us to leave.

666
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,925
She packed our bags, and I said:

667
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:29,262
"You know what?
You know, just a little bit longer."

668
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:33,683
And all I was thinking was:

669
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,395
"Stay.

670
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,189
This is good for me.

671
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,775
Stay.

672
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,446
Show Newsom you got the balls."

673
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:56,122
I can't believe I put Kathy in this position.

674
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,049
I think we're gonna die here.

675
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:38,122
ISTANBUL, TURKEY - JANUARY 27, 1980

676
00:48:56,558 --> 00:49:00,978
"Iran is 100 percent
not in a prerevolutionary state."

677
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:04,190
CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.

678
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,359
Can't be right all the time.

679
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,027
Kevin.

680
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:09,737
When'd you get back?

681
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,157
The shah escaped in a 747...

682
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,702
...so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it off the runway.

683
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:17,912
But you kept busy.

684
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,125
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

685
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,086
It's getting worse.

686
00:49:25,253 --> 00:49:28,214
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

687
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:33,260
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

688
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:34,971
When you leave, they match them up. ..

689
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:37,515
...to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

690
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:41,644
So if they look, they'll see I didn't come
into the country with six people.

691
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,146
If they look.

692
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:51,195
When you land, you should go straight to
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

693
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:52,822
...to kiss the ring.

694
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:56,200
Get on record as having applied
for a film permit.

695
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,121
If they catch you later, at least they'll be
confused while they're torturing you.

696
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:08,045
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

697
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,974
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

698
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,477
Uh, film production. Business.

699
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:28,649
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

700
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,863
I would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till I got here.

701
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:38,117
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.

702
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:01,807
The Times and AP found out six escaped.

703
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:05,311
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

704
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,271
Somebody with one of the families talked.

705
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,814
Mother of God.

706
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:11,776
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

707
00:51:11,943 --> 00:51:14,403
He thinks he can
get them to sit on it, for now.

708
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,364
Your guy better get them...

709
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,909
...and get the hell out.

710
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,662
The captain has informed
us that we have entered Iranian airspace.

711
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:28,334
We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.

712
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,202
This film crew is just yourself?

713
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:11,705
No, we have six more from Canada
meeting us today.

714
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,707
You like to film at the bazaar?

715
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,043
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

716
00:54:16,878 --> 00:54:18,504
Landmark sites.

717
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,297
I see.

718
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,967
The exotic Orient.

719
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,762
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

720
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,557
You came to us at a complicated time.

721
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:34,728
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

722
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,147
I understand.

723
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:40,484
The function of this office is purification...

724
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,946
...as well as promotion for the arts.

725
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,825
I'll review this for the minister.

726
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:49,994
Okay. Thank you.

727
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:01,213
Lester, you're working late.

728
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,299
Till the dawn's early light.

729
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,344
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

730
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:10,389
Well, I'm 150 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.

731
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,484
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

732
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,153
Thank you for what you're doing.

733
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:27,781
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

734
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,868
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

735
00:55:31,661 --> 00:55:33,996
Ah. This way.

736
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:49,845
- These are blank, you know. Stamps.. ..
- Yeah, I'll take care of this.

737
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,182
How long?

738
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,185
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

739
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,686
And you'll fly out with them?

740
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,730
Yeah.

741
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,565
There's something you should know.

742
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:05,027
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

743
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:10,032
We don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.

744
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,208
Hi.

745
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,252
My name's Kevin Harkins. ..

746
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:05,921
...and I'm gonna get you home.

747
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:10,008
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

748
00:57:11,636 --> 00:57:14,096
It's theater of the absurd.

749
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,849
- What are our chances?
- Your chances are good.

750
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:20,144
"Good"? Well, what's the number value
of "good"?

751
00:57:20,353 --> 00:57:23,063
Thirty percent chance
of being publicly executed?

752
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:26,775
Can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?

753
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:29,153
There are no Canadians in the country
for normal reasons.

754
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,863
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

755
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,700
They accused him of being an American
at the airport. They held him for an hour.

756
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,911
We can't hold up under that.
We don't know what the hell movie people do.

757
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,204
That's why I'm here.

758
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:42,875
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with you
the whole way. This is what I do.

759
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,085
Have you gotten people out
this way before?

760
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:47,921
This would be a first.

761
00:57:49,424 --> 00:57:53,010
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

762
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,679
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads. ..

763
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,599
...just for having American names
in their phone books.

764
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,225
You've been here an hour.

765
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,811
And you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, Mr. ..?

766
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,313
Harkins.

767
00:58:04,522 --> 00:58:06,315
That's your real name?

768
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,150
No.

769
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:14,907
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

770
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,117
But it is time to go.

771
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:23,207
We've got orders to close the embassy
and go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.

772
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:29,421
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. I'm serious.

773
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:33,509
No, no, no, this is what, the part when
we say this is so crazy it might actually work?

774
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,511
Joe, I saw it in Burma. They get people out.

775
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,931
Snitches in banana republics?
They get them over the border after the coup.

776
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,140
That's your opinion, Joe.

777
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,476
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

778
00:58:42,977 --> 00:58:47,105
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

779
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:49,816
- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.

780
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:54,112
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

781
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,865
Pat and I have discussed it.
It's the risk we took.

782
00:58:57,659 --> 00:59:00,577
That man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.

783
00:59:00,745 --> 00:59:04,039
And if he loses, it's our lives.

784
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,334
And his life too.

785
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,671
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

786
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,047
We gotta go.

787
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:22,015
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

788
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:24,726
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

789
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,813
Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.

790
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:29,064
And then add to that.

791
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:32,651
Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?

792
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:33,986
The only way this works. ..

793
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:37,823
...is if you believe that you're these people
so much that you dream like them.

794
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,492
Get started tonight.

795
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:44,204
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

796
00:59:49,794 --> 00:59:51,503
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

797
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,046
What's your name?

798
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:56,049
Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.

799
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,051
That was convincing.

800
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,886
Kathy, what's your name?

801
01:00:27,874 --> 01:00:31,084
The Love Boat
will be seen 15 minutes from now.

802
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:35,047
The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...

803
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:39,301
...will not divert the attention of the
United States from the plight of the hostages.

804
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:42,179
--is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant....

805
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:46,850
Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...

806
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:49,853
...over that country's invasion
of Afghanistan....

807
01:00:50,063 --> 01:00:52,481
The United States
is now moving toward a decision...

808
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,691
...to boycott the Summer Olympics
in Moscow....

809
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,071
Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.

810
01:00:59,447 --> 01:01:03,575
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

811
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:35,732
"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.

812
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,818
He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew...

813
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,571
...at the Khayyam entrance
to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m."

814
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,615
They called your bluff.

815
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,368
- Maybe they're cooperating.
- Absolutely not.

816
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:51,164
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.

817
01:01:51,332 --> 01:01:52,666
Seven Canadians, Jack.

818
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:55,961
Never give them multiple shots at a cover.

819
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:57,963
Are they even ready?

820
01:01:58,131 --> 01:01:59,381
They're getting there.

821
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,091
There's no prize for "Most Improved."

822
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:03,969
I don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence...

823
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,763
...and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up. ..

824
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,765
...when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?

825
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:32,789
You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

826
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:36,877
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

827
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,670
They suspect something?

828
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,590
What I know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.

829
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:45,177
We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.

830
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:48,680
We won't do it.

831
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:53,185
He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.

832
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,562
It would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.

833
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,856
What else do we have to do, all right?

834
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,567
He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding. ..

835
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,404
- ...which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?

836
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,698
Look, we don't have any other choice!

837
01:03:06,866 --> 01:03:09,201
Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?

838
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,119
We're not in the CIA.

839
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:13,872
It's suicide.

840
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,124
I'm asking you to trust me.

841
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:18,710
I don't trust you.

842
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,799
This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?

843
01:03:23,966 --> 01:03:27,594
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.

844
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:30,847
It's too dangerous.
I won't bring my wife into the bazaar.

845
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,267
Joe?

846
01:03:40,983 --> 01:03:42,818
So we'll see you at 2.

847
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:10,762
So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.

848
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:14,474
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

849
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,353
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

850
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:21,690
Sorry. Okay.

851
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:31,783
Hello?

852
01:04:38,666 --> 01:04:39,958
Who was that?

853
01:04:43,296 --> 01:04:45,005
- Mark?
- Yeah?

854
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,884
I'm scared.

855
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:52,470
It's okay.

856
01:05:40,353 --> 01:05:41,519
Where are they?

857
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,021
In the kitchen.

858
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:03,416
This is what I do. I get people out.

859
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,754
And I've never left anyone behind.

860
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,800
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

861
01:06:16,931 --> 01:06:20,225
My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.

862
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:23,144
My father worked construction.
My mother teaches elementary school.

863
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:25,689
I have a wife and a 10-year-old son.

864
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:32,779
You play along with me today,
I promise you, I will get you out tomorrow.

865
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:38,868
Fuck.

866
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:21,327
Shit.

867
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:49,856
Hang on.

868
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,656
You all right?

869
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,080
Okay. Tell me who you are.

870
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:50,041
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

871
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:52,794
Robert Baker, director.

872
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:55,255
Timothy Harris, location manager.

873
01:08:55,422 --> 01:08:57,423
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

874
01:08:57,591 --> 01:08:59,342
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

875
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,261
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

876
01:09:01,428 --> 01:09:03,972
All right. Let's go make a movie.

877
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,279
Welcome, welcome.
My name is Reza Bolhani.

878
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:21,823
- Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.
- Nice to meet you.

879
01:09:21,991 --> 01:09:23,616
This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.

880
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:25,994
This is Tim.
This is Mary, our screenwriter.

881
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,662
And this is our director, Bob Baker.

882
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,581
- You are the director?
- Yes.

883
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:32,208
Is this film a foreign-bride film?

884
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,419
Sorry?

885
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:37,046
A film where a foreign bride comes to Iran. ..

886
01:09:37,214 --> 01:09:40,758
...but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs...

887
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:43,469
...and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.

888
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:45,096
Oh, no.

889
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:55,773
The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.

890
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:00,528
This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

891
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:04,908
You can find many items
such as paper, spices...

892
01:10:05,117 --> 01:10:07,619
...precious metals, all right here.

893
01:10:07,786 --> 01:10:08,995
Right this way, please.

894
01:10:14,376 --> 01:10:15,752
This way.

895
01:10:30,851 --> 01:10:32,143
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

896
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:36,481
If I was to say you're looking through the
wrong end of that viewfinder, would I be right?

897
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,360
Yup.

898
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:48,701
Just a little further.

899
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:21,943
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

900
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:40,503
He wants the photograph you took.

901
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:43,756
It's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.

902
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:47,176
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

903
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:50,013
That's okay. You can tell him he can have it.

904
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,391
Please, please, just take the photograph.

905
01:12:03,193 --> 01:12:04,235
Peace be upοn yοu.

906
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:05,778
And upοn yοu, sir. Welcοme.

907
01:12:05,946 --> 01:12:07,196
I hοpe yοu are well.

908
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,032
Τhank yοu very much. Hοw are yοu?

909
01:12:09,241 --> 01:12:11,617
I'm very well. What's yοur name?

910
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:12,952
Sahar.

911
01:12:23,964 --> 01:12:27,133
He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.

912
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:39,187
No, no, no! No! Canada!

913
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:40,396
Canada!

914
01:12:40,564 --> 01:12:42,857
I would like to suggest that we end our visit.

915
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,284
Yοu knοw, sister...

916
01:12:53,452 --> 01:12:57,455
...thοse whο are with him, Rasοοl οf Allah,
we are tender amοng οurselves.

917
01:12:57,623 --> 01:12:59,165
But stern against the Kufar.

918
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,209
As Gοd wills it.

919
01:13:02,836 --> 01:13:06,047
But thοse whο sit silently have sinned.

920
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,509
Hοw else may I help, sir?

921
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:12,011
Nο, nο, just οne thing.

922
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:15,515
Hοw lοng have they been here?

923
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:17,809
Pardοn?

924
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:20,853
The guests of the Ambassador.

925
01:13:20,854 --> 01:13:22,230
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

926
01:13:25,109 --> 01:13:26,692
Τhey arrived twο days agο.

927
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:32,198
Fοrgive my intrusiοn, οne must be vigilant.

928
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,369
Everyοne in this hοuse is a friend οf Iran.

929
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:12,363
How'd it go?

930
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,616
What about tomorrow?

931
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:18,494
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

932
01:14:22,416 --> 01:14:24,709
For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...

933
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,919
...one week after humiliation in Illinois.

934
01:14:27,087 --> 01:14:28,379
I love New York.

935
01:14:29,756 --> 01:14:32,300
And I love Connecticut too.

936
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:35,094
How did he win here? Well, he had help.

937
01:14:35,262 --> 01:14:39,891
I'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.

938
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:44,103
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

939
01:14:45,105 --> 01:14:48,232
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

940
01:14:48,775 --> 01:14:51,194
The six with the Canadians
are coming out.

941
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,831
Who signed off on this?

942
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,792
- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.

943
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,252
- Where were you born?
- Toronto.

944
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:10,421
"Torono." Canadians don't pronounce the T.

945
01:15:10,589 --> 01:15:13,007
Some Komiteh guard
is actually gonna know that?

946
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:16,969
If you're detained for questioning, they will
bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

947
01:15:17,137 --> 01:15:20,348
Mary, who were the last three prime ministers
of Canada?

948
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:23,309
Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

949
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,144
- What's your father's name?
- Howard.

950
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:27,063
- What's his occupation?
- Fisherman.

951
01:15:27,231 --> 01:15:29,482
- Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

952
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,400
What's your date of birth?

953
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,736
February 21st, 1952.

954
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,863
- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.

955
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:38,783
- Associate. Last movie you produced?
- High and Dry.

956
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,451
- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.

957
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:42,954
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

958
01:15:43,121 --> 01:15:44,830
- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.

959
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:50,294
Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.

960
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,588
You have to know your résumé
back to front.

961
01:15:52,756 --> 01:15:57,093
You really believe your little story's gonna make
a difference when there's a gun to our heads?

962
01:15:58,011 --> 01:16:01,180
I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

963
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:05,560
Okay.

964
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:13,734
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

965
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:27,373
You have a call.

966
01:16:38,302 --> 01:16:39,343
What is it?

967
01:16:39,511 --> 01:16:40,595
Go to black on green.

968
01:16:43,307 --> 01:16:44,390
Go.

969
01:16:44,558 --> 01:16:46,017
- It all just changed.
- What?

970
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,769
- They're calling the game. You gotta come back.
- What?

971
01:16:48,937 --> 01:16:51,647
Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.

972
01:16:51,815 --> 01:16:54,358
Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.

973
01:16:54,526 --> 01:16:56,402
So if the six of them...

974
01:16:56,570 --> 01:17:00,197
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

975
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:04,744
Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed
them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.

976
01:17:04,911 --> 01:17:07,622
- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.

977
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:12,543
- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

978
01:17:12,711 --> 01:17:16,380
Six Americans get pulled out
of a Canadian diplomat's house and executed...

979
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,466
...it's a world outrage.

980
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:21,594
Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...

981
01:17:21,762 --> 01:17:24,430
...with the CIA at the airport and executed?

982
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:29,477
It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

983
01:17:31,730 --> 01:17:34,273
We're responsible for these people.

984
01:17:35,275 --> 01:17:38,069
What we are is required to follow orders.

985
01:17:38,945 --> 01:17:40,321
I'm sorry.

986
01:17:49,706 --> 01:17:51,082
Fuck!

987
01:17:57,923 --> 01:17:58,964
Come in.

988
01:18:00,592 --> 01:18:02,176
Ready to try again.

989
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:07,181
You're ready. You worked hard.

990
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:11,227
Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be...

991
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,521
...just to relax.

992
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:15,398
Okay.

993
01:18:15,941 --> 01:18:17,400
You did good.

994
01:18:18,318 --> 01:18:19,610
Thanks.

995
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:35,292
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

996
01:18:37,003 --> 01:18:38,838
Nothing gets left.

997
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:47,388
So you know.

998
01:18:49,182 --> 01:18:52,977
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.

999
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,150
If we tell them now, they'll panic.
I think it's best if you just don't show.

1000
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,696
It was always a fucked mission.

1001
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:06,657
You came closer than anybody else.

1002
01:19:10,620 --> 01:19:22,923
If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break

1003
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:30,014
When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay

1004
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:39,977
Ahem. It's off.
They want us to pack up the office.

1005
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:43,814
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

1006
01:22:09,132 --> 01:22:11,050
He's late.

1007
01:22:24,481 --> 01:22:25,522
O'Donnell.

1008
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:26,941
Somebody's responsible...

1009
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:28,943
...when things happen, Jack.

1010
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,153
I'm responsible.

1011
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:33,948
- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?

1012
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:48,295
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

1013
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,756
- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.

1014
01:22:50,924 --> 01:22:53,676
- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.

1015
01:22:53,843 --> 01:22:56,845
What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?

1016
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:59,807
Carter's gotta say yes for us
to get the tickets.

1017
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,818
It's time to go.

1018
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,204
All right.

1019
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,750
- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.

1020
01:23:26,918 --> 01:23:29,837
- Pull him out.
- Uh.. ..

1021
01:23:30,005 --> 01:23:31,171
Pull him out!

1022
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:33,173
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

1023
01:23:33,758 --> 01:23:35,426
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

1024
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,511
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

1025
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:39,096
Sahar will be fine.

1026
01:23:39,264 --> 01:23:41,015
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1027
01:23:41,266 --> 01:23:44,518
- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.

1028
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:45,769
Good.

1029
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:50,566
N.E. said no.

1030
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:55,404
This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!

1031
01:23:55,572 --> 01:23:56,780
It is going!

1032
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:58,949
Jack, you are this close.

1033
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,993
Am I? Am I really that close?

1034
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:03,120
You are this goddamn close to the line
with me.

1035
01:24:03,288 --> 01:24:06,832
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

1036
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,461
You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!

1037
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:20,179
Get to your plane, Claude.

1038
01:24:27,187 --> 01:24:30,647
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.

1039
01:24:31,316 --> 01:24:33,817
The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.

1040
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:37,988
Passports came straight from Ottawa
last week. They're clean.

1041
01:24:38,406 --> 01:24:40,240
Find the White House chief of staff.

1042
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:41,492
How would I find him?

1043
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:44,661
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

1044
01:24:45,413 --> 01:24:48,749
The second checkpoint is immigration.

1045
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,667
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

1046
01:24:50,835 --> 01:24:53,420
It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.

1047
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:57,007
They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.

1048
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,967
You'll say you don't know what happened.

1049
01:24:59,135 --> 01:25:01,053
And if you believe they lost the white slip...

1050
01:25:02,305 --> 01:25:03,388
...they'll believe it too.

1051
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:07,351
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

1052
01:25:08,853 --> 01:25:10,354
Where are his kids?

1053
01:25:10,522 --> 01:25:11,563
What?

1054
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:13,273
Where do his kids go to school?

1055
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,782
Thank you, thank you.

1056
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,201
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

1057
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:28,622
White House.

1058
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:33,377
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.

1059
01:25:33,545 --> 01:25:35,879
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

1060
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:38,257
Hold for the chief of staff's office.

1061
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:41,009
The third checkpoint is the trap.

1062
01:25:41,177 --> 01:25:42,803
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

1063
01:25:43,429 --> 01:25:45,681
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

1064
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:49,101
And all of whom are looking for Americans.

1065
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:01,989
Hello?

1066
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:03,949
- Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.
- Wait, wait, who?

1067
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:07,911
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

1068
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,164
They are going to be captured.

1069
01:26:10,331 --> 01:26:11,456
David, pick up!

1070
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:31,643
Zurich. It's under Harkins.

1071
01:26:39,819 --> 01:26:42,487
I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.

1072
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,951
Telex on flash.

1073
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,954
Would you mind checking again, please?

1074
01:26:59,631 --> 01:27:02,382
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

1075
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,481
My apologies. It just came through.

1076
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:26,865
Swissair says they picked up the tickets.

1077
01:27:27,033 --> 01:27:29,701
Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.

1078
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,995
We told them to shut that down.

1079
01:28:03,111 --> 01:28:04,528
There you go.

1080
01:28:21,379 --> 01:28:22,796
Not here.

1081
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:27,778
When did you come to Iran?

1082
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:30,113
Two days ago.

1083
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,948
What was the purpose of your visit?

1084
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:35,619
We are looking for locations for a film.

1085
01:29:42,418 --> 01:29:43,502
We have a--

1086
01:29:43,669 --> 01:29:48,548
Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

1087
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:51,718
If you want to take a look at that. All right?

1088
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:13,949
- Ahem.
- You can go.

1089
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:25,168
Come on, come on.

1090
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:42,144
Swissair Flight 363
is now boarding Rows 18 to 35.

1091
01:31:16,554 --> 01:31:18,805
We're going to. ...

1092
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,046
We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.

1093
01:31:52,548 --> 01:31:54,633
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

1094
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,301
They should have boarded already.

1095
01:31:56,469 --> 01:31:58,053
Still no answer in L.A.

1096
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:24,287
Sir.

1097
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:37,801
Yes, it's a fantasy story
about a war in another world.

1098
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,678
Here you can see our notices.

1099
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,850
Of course I speak Farsi.

1100
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:48,228
I wish to make a film in Iran.

1101
01:33:04,996 --> 01:33:08,456
No, I'm the writer.

1102
01:33:08,666 --> 01:33:10,542
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

1103
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:15,171
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

1104
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:18,008
Alien villains have taken over the hero's planet.

1105
01:33:18,175 --> 01:33:21,344
They fight for their families and
take back the city.

1106
01:33:21,512 --> 01:33:27,851
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

1107
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:32,022
So he and his wife storm the castle.

1108
01:33:32,189 --> 01:33:39,195
The people... hold that... the people are inspired tojoin him.
They are farmers, but they learn to fight.

1109
01:33:42,950 --> 01:33:44,743
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

1110
01:33:48,956 --> 01:33:52,208
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

1111
01:34:01,385 --> 01:34:03,511
You don't go until we verify.

1112
01:34:08,059 --> 01:34:10,101
I understand.

1113
01:34:10,269 --> 01:34:12,437
Sir, you can call our office.

1114
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:13,938
They'll verify.

1115
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:42,050
- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

1116
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:46,096
- We're just going to the Producers Building.
- Yeah, I understand. We're shooting right now.

1117
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:23,842
Swissair announces
final boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.

1118
01:35:31,809 --> 01:35:33,560
Reset! We're back to one.

1119
01:35:33,728 --> 01:35:35,687
- All right, reset.
- We're going again!

1120
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:38,857
- We're just right at the Producers--
- Right away, everyone! And rolling!

1121
01:35:39,024 --> 01:35:41,317
- We're going to the Producers Building.
- We're rolling.

1122
01:36:17,646 --> 01:36:20,607
Sorry, pal. We're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agent.

1123
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:22,108
Sir!

1124
01:36:34,038 --> 01:36:36,039
Studio Six Productions.

1125
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:39,375
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

1126
01:36:39,543 --> 01:36:43,713
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May I take a message?

1127
01:37:01,357 --> 01:37:04,776
Doors are closing for Flight 363 to Zurich.

1128
01:37:13,035 --> 01:37:14,244
We can go.

1129
01:37:23,462 --> 01:37:25,630
You keep these. It's a gift.

1130
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:54,284
Miss.

1131
01:39:58,909 --> 01:40:00,910
Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?

1132
01:40:04,081 --> 01:40:07,583
Swissair 363,
you are number two for departure.

1133
01:40:14,925 --> 01:40:18,761
Ladies and gentlemen, from
the flight deck, we are number two for takeoff.

1134
01:40:55,966 --> 01:40:58,885
Swissair 363, you are cleared for takeoff.

1135
01:41:02,973 --> 01:41:04,849
Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.

1136
01:42:10,165 --> 01:42:11,207
We got wheels up.

1137
01:42:11,750 --> 01:42:12,792
Wait.

1138
01:42:28,392 --> 01:42:31,060
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce...

1139
01:42:31,228 --> 01:42:34,939
...that alcoholic beverages are now available
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

1140
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:41,445
I love you.

1141
01:43:23,488 --> 01:43:25,781
They're clear. Ha-ha-ha!

1142
01:43:25,949 --> 01:43:27,450
Yes! Yes!

1143
01:43:28,327 --> 01:43:30,453
- Yeah!
- Yes!

1144
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,787
Yeah, man.

1145
01:43:32,247 --> 01:43:33,956
They're out!

1146
01:43:34,124 --> 01:43:37,335
- They're out! They're out!
- We got them out!

1147
01:43:40,672 --> 01:43:41,797
They're out!

1148
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:47,803
Yes!

1149
01:43:47,971 --> 01:43:50,139
Great work, boys.

1150
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:51,307
We did it!

1151
01:44:03,320 --> 01:44:06,489
You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.

1152
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:52,868
We made history tonight.

1153
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:57,373
History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.

1154
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,542
Quote's the other way around.

1155
01:45:00,210 --> 01:45:02,712
- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.

1156
01:45:03,630 --> 01:45:04,672
Groucho said that?

1157
01:45:09,219 --> 01:45:11,721
Call the Times, nail it to the goddamn door.

1158
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:13,597
CIA are the good guys.

1159
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:15,599
The Canadians are the good guys.

1160
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,476
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

1161
01:45:18,228 --> 01:45:22,732
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

1162
01:45:23,567 --> 01:45:25,401
Great Satan wasn't involved.

1163
01:45:26,153 --> 01:45:28,154
No CIA.

1164
01:45:28,363 --> 01:45:29,905
Is that right, Jack?

1165
01:45:32,075 --> 01:45:33,784
Involved in what?

1166
01:45:34,786 --> 01:45:37,288
We were as surprised as anybody.

1167
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,959
Thank you, Canada.

1168
01:45:42,169 --> 01:45:44,837
We knew that each day they stayed there...

1169
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:47,673
...the danger was becoming greater.

1170
01:45:47,883 --> 01:45:51,927
We had been looking for a solution to have them
leave the country during the past three months.

1171
01:45:52,095 --> 01:45:54,764
Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.

1172
01:45:54,931 --> 01:45:58,726
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford. ..

1173
01:46:00,228 --> 01:46:01,645
...Kathy Stafford...

1174
01:46:02,939 --> 01:46:04,648
...Mark Lijek.. ..

1175
01:46:05,275 --> 01:46:10,488
We Americans will be forever grateful
to our great friend and ally to the north...

1176
01:46:10,655 --> 01:46:14,909
...for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.

1177
01:46:15,077 --> 01:46:16,327
Bob Anders.

1178
01:46:16,495 --> 01:46:19,205
Here, or anywhere in the world...

1179
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,956
...Canada will pay...

1180
01:46:22,292 --> 01:46:26,295
...for this violation
of the sovereignty of Iran.

1181
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:30,674
Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.

1182
01:46:34,513 --> 01:46:37,223
So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
I'm having breakfast.

1183
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:40,476
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

1184
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:44,021
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

1185
01:46:44,815 --> 01:46:46,649
And I said to her-- Do you know what I said?

1186
01:46:47,067 --> 01:46:48,192
No, what?

1187
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:50,194
"Argo fuck yourself."

1188
01:47:18,974 --> 01:47:20,015
All set.

1189
01:47:20,976 --> 01:47:22,351
Thanks a lot.

1190
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:34,488
Ha!

1191
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:39,368
Heh. And I left my autograph book at home.

1192
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:46,709
His Eminence called me.

1193
01:47:46,877 --> 01:47:48,085
He wants to see you.

1194
01:47:48,587 --> 01:47:50,296
Probably wants to fire me himself.

1195
01:47:51,423 --> 01:47:53,757
He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.

1196
01:47:54,968 --> 01:47:56,802
You're getting the highest award of merit. ..

1197
01:47:57,012 --> 01:48:00,347
...of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

1198
01:48:01,308 --> 01:48:03,225
Ceremony's on the 14th.

1199
01:48:03,393 --> 01:48:06,562
If they push it a week, I can bring lan.
That's his winter break.

1200
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:12,401
The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.

1201
01:48:12,569 --> 01:48:15,613
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

1202
01:48:17,157 --> 01:48:20,242
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

1203
01:48:20,827 --> 01:48:21,869
That's right.

1204
01:48:23,747 --> 01:48:26,081
If we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.

1205
01:48:27,792 --> 01:48:29,919
- I thought we did.
- Ha.

1206
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:33,380
Carter said you were a great American.

1207
01:48:34,090 --> 01:48:35,758
Great American what?

1208
01:48:36,301 --> 01:48:37,760
He didn't say.

1209
01:48:51,107 --> 01:48:52,358
What happened to your picture?

1210
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:55,194
It's in turnaround.

1211
01:49:37,487 --> 01:49:39,071
Can I come in?

1212
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:35,878
The Iran Hostage Crisis ended on
January 20, 1981, when all remaining
hostages were released.
They spent 444 days in captivity.

1213
01:50:37,422 --> 01:50:47,556
The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented efforts of the
Canadian embassy in freeing the six held in Tehran.
To this day, this story stands as an enduring
model for international cooperation between
governments.

1214
01:50:48,975 --> 01:50:55,397
All of the Houseguests returned
to the U.S. Foreign Service after
their ordeal in Iran.

1215
01:50:56,941 --> 01:51:06,909
Oscar-winning makeup artist
John Chambers was awarded the C.I.A.'s
Intelligence Medal, its highest civilian honor.
He and Mendez remained friends
until Chambers' death in 2001.

1216
01:51:08,703 --> 01:51:15,668
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star was returned
to him in 1997, when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

1217
01:51:25,720 --> 01:51:33,686
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

1218
01:53:26,132 --> 01:53:31,136
They went in, as you know, under
the guise of creating a motion-picture film.

1219
01:53:31,346 --> 01:53:35,974
But that it had a very high possibility
of failure.

1220
01:53:36,142 --> 01:53:38,435
And after it was successful, of course...

1221
01:53:38,603 --> 01:53:41,396
...it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...

1222
01:53:41,564 --> 01:53:44,983
...so maybe I could take a little bit
of credit for it, since I was president...

1223
01:53:45,151 --> 01:53:49,738
...but we had to keep it secret.
Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...

1224
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,782
...after his retirement...

1225
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:58,789
...as one of the 50 most important
CIA operatives of all time.

1226
01:53:59,415 --> 01:54:04,795
Eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...

1227
01:54:04,963 --> 01:54:08,966
...and we upheld the integrity of our country,
and we did it peacefully.
