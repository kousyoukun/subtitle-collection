1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,800
This is the Persian Empire

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,200
known today as Iran.

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:10,260
For 2,500 years, this land
 was ruled by a series of kings

4
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,130
known as "Shahs"

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,800
In 1950, the people of Iran 
elected Mohammad Mosaddegh

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,930
a secular democrat, as prime minister.

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,730
He nationalized British
 and US petrolium holdings

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,930
returning Iran's oil to its people.

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,930
But in 1953

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,800
The US and Great Britain ingineered a coup d'état

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,000
that deposed Mosaddeghm,
and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,530
The young child was known
 for opulence and excess.

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
His wife was rumored to bathe in milk

14
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,860
while the Shah had his lunches
 flown in by concord from Paris.

15
00:00:52,130 --> 00:00:53,800
The people starved.

16
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,600
The Shah kept power through
 his ruthless internal police

17
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:01,060
the Savak.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,660
An era of torture and fear began.

19
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,600
He then began a campaign
 to westernize Iran

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:15,460
enraging the the mostly
 traditional Shia population.

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,260
In 1979,
 the people of Iran overthrew the Shah.

22
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,800
The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
 returned to rule Iran.

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,000
It descended into score settling,
 death squads and chaos.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,400
Dying of cancer the Shah
 was given assylum in the US.

25
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:47,070
The Iranian people took
 to the streets outside the US embassy

26
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,600
demanding that the Shah be returned

27
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,570
tried

28
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,070
and hanged.

29
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,920
The carnival is a
 little bigger today, huh?

30
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,900
Windows are supposed to be
 bulletproof, right?

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,850
I know they've never been tested.

32
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,400
Ok you just need to finish filling out

33
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,870
this section here.

34
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:10,250
We need some security.

35
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:10,750
Yes.

36
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,710
It's an ast...

37
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,080
- ...your responsibility.
- They've gone through over the walls.

38
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,270
We should all split.

39
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,560
I'm going to close up my office.

40
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,560
My God!

41
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,780
What do you see Number 1?

42
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:40,740
Fall back.

43
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,510
- Well I need police, I need police right now.
- Can anyone hear me? We're on the second floor.

44
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,240
- You understand me?
- We need help.

45
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,390
Right now, goddamn it!

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,440
- Cany anybody hear me?
- Attention Mano Lethalme

47
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,270
there is a breach.

48
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,260
Burn everything!

49
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,000
Burn it now!

50
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,180
Alright burn everything,

51
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,980
all the files,
file cabinets, safe.

52
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,760
Lets get a cart over here.

53
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,860
Burn it all, come on.

54
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:13,250
Burn everything,
including the classified. Everything!

55
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,850
Delete it all.

56
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,570
Don't fucking shoot anybody.

57
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,900
You don't want to be
 the son of a bitch who started the war.

58
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,200
They need an hour to burn the classified.

59
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,200
I need you to hold.

60
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,770
If you shoot one person

61
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,290
They're gonna kill
 every single one of us in here.

62
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,390
I'm telling you if we're going to go,
 we need to go now!

63
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,360
- And we need to make a decision, and...
- Joe can we..Joe can we wait

64
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,110
can we wait until
 the Iranian police come?

65
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:47,340
No!

66
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,530
They're not coming.

67
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,390
How do you know they're not coming?

68
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,510
They may well be coming.

69
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,020
- Police have abandoned their post.
- If  the police are not coming,

70
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,360
ok, then the army's gonna come.

71
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,090
The Prime Minister is not

72
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,410
- gonna let the embassy be taken over.
- I understand.

73
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,850
The Prime Minister may come tomorrow.

74
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,190
But the Komiteh are here today.

75
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,140
Alright. Is there...
is there any...?

76
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:02,900
Look at me!

77
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,420
No one is coming.

78
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:05,780
Burn it!
We have forty minutes.

79
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,320
Get it down in the incinerator,
 in the vault, now!

80
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,220
Tear gas is our last resource, only!

81
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,880
I refuse holding until
 and after under gun threat.

82
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,920
In here, we are in America right now!
Outside these doors we are in Iran!

83
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,470
I'm not going out there!
They're after us.

84
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,450
They're not safe here.

85
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,040
They get caught
 applying for visas to the US...

86
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,120
Lets...lets wait five minutes.

87
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:06,530
We're in the only building
 with direct access to the street.

88
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:08,530
If we're going to go,
 then we need to go now!

89
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,360
Yeah, I'm in.

90
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,110
Yeah.

91
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,040
Yeah, lets go.

92
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,200
I'm going outside.

93
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,130
Malick!

94
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,230
I'm gonna reason with them!

95
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:47,010
Open the door!

96
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,410
Open the door!

97
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,410
Open the fucking door!

98
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,500
So you wanna see the world?

99
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:54,970
Huh, hah.

100
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,450
Burn it all, come on!

101
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,740
Displace them
 if the filing cabinets get long.

102
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,760
All four drawers,
 I want them shredder, right now!

103
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,100
And a shred basket, man.

104
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,080
All four!

105
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,070
Anything else you see out there

106
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,070
set it out the shred it.

107
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:36,040
We've got ten minutes!
 Lets go, lets go, lets go! Everything!

108
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:46,660
Get the shredder.

109
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,370
There are no police.

110
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,450
Lets go!

111
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,260
Come on!

112
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,620
We gotta get off the streets.

113
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,030
This way, up here  to the left.

114
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,220
They fuck with us,
 we can't get 'em back?

115
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,220
Mossadegh. We did it to them first.

116
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,460
Would the Soviets put up with this shit?

117
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,490
They'd fucking invade!

118
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,840
What do you expect? We held they guy,
 tortured and debald an entire population.

119
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,460
How many were there?

120
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,310
At least fifty.

121
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,130
We're not sure.

122
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,450
Shaffer!

123
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:42,830
We still haven't found Shaffer?

124
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,830
No I was screaming
 his name 'cus I was fucking'em.

125
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,060
It's confirmed,
 sir, six escaped.

126
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,240
I was told five.

127
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,610
Now sir. Apparently, it's six.

128
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,570
So what happened?

129
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,640
Not clear. We know they escaped the embassy.

130
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:56,420
Where are they?

131
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,060
The Canadian Ambassador's house.

132
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,800
Do they stay put?
Are we attempting a rescue?

133
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,180
Hold for the Secretary of State.

134
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:02,010
Yes.

135
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,020
Is White House joining?

136
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,020
They're claiming the Embassy
 was a den of espionage.

137
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,650
We wish we were 
the fucking den of espionage

138
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,220
CIA's got three people over there,
 they don't see a revolution coming?

139
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,900
Call it other something then intelligence.

140
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,480
Hold for the Shief of Staff.

141
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,620
I'll call him back.

142
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,530
They're sticking to it. No release
 until we expell the Shah.

143
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,930
Well, put him on a plane then,
fuck him.

144
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,190
He's half dead
and he's in chemo.

145
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,320
Well, we took him in,
he's ours now.

146
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,460
Great. So, we'll take any
 prick as long as he's got cancer?

147
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:26,250
Just the pricks on our side.

148
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:28,540
So all of our other pricks
 on their prick thrones

149
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,090
will know that when they
 get thrown out on a rail,

150
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,670
they won't get their
 fucking spleens taken out

151
00:11:31,670 --> 00:11:33,410
 by some camel vet with cyanide.

152
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,410
What about the six who
 are with the Canadians?

153
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:39,520
We've got sixty in the Embassy
 with guns to their heads right now.

154
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,790
The whole world is
 watching the Embassy.

155
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,330
That makes them safer
 than the six on the street.

156
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,410
Bonnie Sauder is saying
 it'll be over in twenty-four hours.

157
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,560
We leave the six where they are.

158
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,560
I'll go brief the President.

159
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:32,300
<i>Iran's Revolutionary Guard, has rounded up a gang of terrorist blamed
for one murder of a half-dozen followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

160
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:36,020
<i>It says that security at Khomeini's home now has the fight.</i>

161
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:40,950
<i>This by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Theran.</i>

162
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,620
<i>There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

163
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:47,400
<i>In this country, George Mitty died last night</i>

164
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,250
Yeah.

165
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,330
Yes.

166
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:57,730
What?

167
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,160
<i>To begin with, of course,</i>

168
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,400
<i>we wanted to learn</i>

169
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,860
<i>about the hostages held in
the American Embassy compound.</i>

170
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:07,500
<i>They may not understand what their
ordeal means to their countrymen</i>

171
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,100
<i>that this nation, their nation</i>

172
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,030
<i>is outraged.</i>

173
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,600
<i>And we cannot really
know what it is like</i>

174
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,300
<i>inside the prison that
was once our embassy.</i>

175
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:17,030
<i>Actions of Iran</i>

176
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,530
<i>have shocked</i>

177
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,160
<i>the civilized world.</i>

178
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,860
<i>Our embassy has been</i>

179
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,930
<i>seized, and more than sixty</i>

180
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,930
<i>American citizens</i>

181
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,930
<i>continue to be held as hostages.</i>

182
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:32,130
As this situation tends to unravel
it will become a pain to free the hostages.

183
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,600
In besieged situations with
a random change, however...

184
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,570
What happened?

185
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,080
Six of them went
out a back exit.

186
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,940
Brits turned them away,

187
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,680
Kiwi's turned them away,
Canadians took 'em in.

188
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,000
Traffic calls them
 'House Guests'.

189
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,450
They haven't left the Canadian
Ambassador's house since it happened.

190
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,970
Why didn't we get
them ten weeks ago?

191
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,800
Too dangerous.

192
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:07,370
We got revolutionary guards going
door to door, like Jehovah's Witnesses.

193
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:11,080
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the Embassy.

194
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,110
What about the White House?

195
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,850
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

196
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,850
The Canadians are done,

197
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,340
they say they're
baring too much risk.

198
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,400
Their Foreign Secretary
corners Vance in Brussels

199
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,200
and told him she wants
the six of them out.

200
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,220
Who else knows?

201
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,620
Just the families.

202
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,770
Meanwhile, some genius
in our Embassy

203
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:30,170
was keeping a mug book on
everybody who who worked there.

204
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,710
Jesus Christ!

205
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,050
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

206
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:36,170
But now the bastards are using

207
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,650
sweatshop kids
to reassemble the shreds.

208
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,110
Once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out

209
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:43,710
and they'll know what they look like.

210
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,250
Standing room only for
beheadings in the square.

211
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,370
Who's handling?

212
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,250
State is coordinating in-house.

213
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,000
State?

214
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,000
They don't do exfil's.

215
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,080
They do now.

216
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,820
They wanna run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

217
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,880
Engell says, it's a lose-lose.

218
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,310
These people die,

219
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,310
they die badly, publicly.

220
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,020
State wants the blame,

221
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:06,050
we'll give it to 'em.

222
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,280
What does he want
me here for?

223
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:11,710
So he can tell State he
ran it by his best exfil guy.

224
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,250
Okay.

225
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,540
This is Bob Pender
from State OS.

226
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,540
He's been talking
to Morgan an ex-staff.

227
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:26,540
Thank you.

228
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,310
Alright.

229
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,800
Mark and Cora Lijek

230
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,220
twenty-nine and twenty-five.

231
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,650
He's a Consular Officer,
she's an assistant

232
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,510
newly weds.

233
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,400
They uh...

234
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,400
only just got there
a couple months ago.

235
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,540
No language skills

236
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,370
or in country knowledge.

237
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,600
Henry Lee Schatz

238
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,110
Agricultural attaché from Idaho.

239
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:48,110
Bit of an oddball apparently

240
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,710
he was there to sell U.S.
tractors to Iranian Agro.

241
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,910
Joe Stafford, late twenties

242
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,020
he's smart

243
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,110
and a climber,
speaks Farsi.

244
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,510
He arranged the hire of his wife,

245
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:00,570
Kathy.

246
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:01,910
The Embassy was understaffed

247
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,910
so the faculty wives
were the typing pool.

248
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,220
And Bob Anders

249
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,600
Senior Consular Officer,
oldest of the group

250
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,370
and most likely to
be group leader.

251
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:12,000
They've been hiding at the
Canadian Ambassador residence.

252
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,220
Fortunately

253
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,420
We do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have scaped.

254
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,800
So.

255
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,450
What we'd like for this

256
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,910
are bicycles.

257
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:23,050
We've identified back roads

258
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:24,400
from the Chamran district,

259
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,740
couple of rat lines
through the mountains

260
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,310
to the crossing near Tabriz.

261
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,400
Cars are off the table,

262
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,880
because of the road blocks.

263
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,340
We wait until the
weather clear up,

264
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,710
then deliver the six bikes,

265
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,710
provide them with maps
to the Turkish boarder.

266
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,220
We have intelligence
they can ride bicycles

267
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,970
or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

268
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,800
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

269
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:54,710
Tony...

270
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,280
It's three hundred miles
to the Turkish border

271
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,080
they'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

272
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,450
We were just asked
to sharp shoot this

273
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:04,600
- State is handling the ops.
- I'm sorry

274
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,650
who is this?

275
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,400
Tony is an exfil spesh,

276
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,140
he's got a lot of Shah's
people out after the fall.

277
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,740
Sir if these people can read

278
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,710
or add.

279
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,570
Pretty soon they'll figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

280
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:16,910
It's winter.

281
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,680
You can't afford to wait
around until spring

282
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,200
so it's nice enough
to take a bike ride.

283
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,200
They only way out
of that city is the airport.

284
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,000
You build new cover
identities for 'em,

285
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,170
you send in a Moses, he takes
them out on a commercial flight.

286
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,170
We've explored those options.

287
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,050
You're never gonna get them
through airport control

288
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,420
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could

289
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,450
pose as reporters,

290
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,450
if the government issued
seventy somethings...

291
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,400
- Seventy four.
- Visas

292
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,220
- for American journalists...
- And the Revolutionary Guards

293
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,800
 keep them on seventy four leashes.

294
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,800
If they're caught with
fake journalist creds

295
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,940
it's Peter and Jane's head
in a noose in an hour.

296
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,740
Look, North America accents
gives us limited options

297
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,250
so we get the Canadians
to issue them

298
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:48,310
- passports.
- What about English

299
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,050
teachers at the international school

300
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,110
It's a good idea, but that school's
been closed for eight months.

301
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,680
Okay, so how about
'the do-gooders'?

302
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,450
Six Canadians

303
00:17:57,450 --> 00:18:00,250
have been over there inspecting crops,
ensuring the kids are getting enough to eat

304
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:03,020
we give them creds, makes
them look like AG NGOs.

305
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:05,020
It's a 'feed the kids' thing.

306
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:05,910
Okay.

307
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:07,140
Those kids are black.

308
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,370
Those are African kids.

309
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,450
We can get ethnically
appropriate kids.

310
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:13,170
Are there starving kids in Iran?

311
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:15,710
I'm sure there's some
skinny kids in Iran.

312
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:19,770
Hold on.

313
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:20,540
Sir.

314
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,110
Do you have this newspaper
in front of you?

315
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,480
Would you mind
taking a look at it?

316
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,650
What's in this picture?

317
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,970
Tehran.

318
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,340
Right.
What's on the ground?

319
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,710
Snow.

320
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:33,570
Right.

321
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,310
What crops are the 'do-gooders'
inspecting under frosting?

322
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:39,800
Sir.

323
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,250
Exfils are like abortions

324
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,880
you don't want to need one

325
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,310
but when you do

326
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,770
you don't do it yourself.

327
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,680
You have a better plan?

328
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:55,680
No Sir.

329
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:02,510
<i>What ever the conflicting
signals of Iran today</i>

330
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,880
<i>would have matter everyday</i>

331
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,340
<i>about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies.</i>

332
00:19:07,340 --> 00:19:11,250
<i>The government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demands.</i>

333
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,250
<i>The hostages must be freed.</i>

334
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,450
...has been human rights

335
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,540
it not only does not defend it

336
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,280
it violates them for all nations.

337
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,400
We demand

338
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,140
extradition of a man

339
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,340
who for more than 37 years

340
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:27,370
with the United States support
has killed months old

341
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,370
babies in the arms of their mothers.

342
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,570
<i>It'll be sad if the Americans tried
military force to rescue the hostages.</i>

343
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,940
<i>The students will kill them all
and blow up the Embassy.</i>

344
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,540
<i>Americans were outraged</i>

345
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:40,620
<i>at Iran</i>

346
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,080
<i>and anyone Iranian.</i>

347
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,370
<i>...there was a demonstration in Houston</i>

348
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,250
<i>an Iranian flag was burned.</i>

349
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:50,000
<i>Anti-Iranians demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian Consulate.</i>

350
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,080
<i>...but also it's what led to a decision to scrutinize</i>

351
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,000
<i>the bases of Iran...</i>

352
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,820
They knew

353
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,370
exactly what was going on!

354
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,020
And they know it.

355
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:57,880
But I don't understand

356
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,540
wha...what they should do now.
Send them back?

357
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,280
Just to be tortured and killed?

358
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,480
I don't think that justice
is the worst thing.

359
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,970
<i>...will first tell you that
torture was going on in Iran.</i>

360
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,770
<i>They would never come
to me and say, 'Well</i>

361
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,140
<i>Sir, we have tortured this fellow'.</i>

362
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:13,710
<i>...Sadat of Egypt</i>

363
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,510
<i>he calls you Imam.</i>

364
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:17,710
<i>Forgive me, his words not mine.</i>

365
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,420
<i>A lunatic</i>

366
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,140
Why didn't he have a choice?!

367
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,480
 Why do you think he
didn't have a choice?

368
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,140
Because he would have been
referred to as a barbarian.

369
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:24,680
Please!

370
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,110
I think we've better...

371
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,140
Please everyone

372
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,370
get into the cold room.

373
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,280
<i>Get out of here!</i>

374
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,540
<i>At one point the mob
cornered one of Iranians.</i>

375
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:54,250
<i>When he tried to protect himself,</i>

376
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,800
<i>this is what happened.</i>

377
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,910
Hit him again!

378
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,000
Hit him until he
can't take it anymore!

379
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
We're sick of them!
Yeah!

380
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:04,220
America!

381
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,510
America!

382
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,600
<i>...I mean people are</i>

383
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,600
<i>drawn uptight, they're tense.</i>

384
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,650
<i>They shouldn't even let
those students in there</i>

385
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:13,770
<i>Embassy there.</i>

386
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,820
<i>Just shoot a couple of them.
Show them we mean business.</i>

387
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,420
<i>Men who served in Vietnam for
what they believed to is right</i>

388
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,050
<i>are angry.</i>

389
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:22,110
<i>I'm mad as hell.</i>

390
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:25,140
<i>I'm like that movie guy, that is
screaming around that movie program</i>

391
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,020
<i>You know?</i>

392
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,710
<i>I've had it!</i>

393
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,340
<i>And if huh...</i>

394
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,680
<i>If need be I'll bear arms again.</i>

395
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,650
<i>That's the way it is.
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

396
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:39,000
<i>The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

397
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,400
Hello?

398
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,340
Money man!

399
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,710
I'll get mom.

400
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,340
I'm looking for you.

401
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,310
Did you do your
homework tonight?

402
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,450
Yeah it was easy.

403
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,450
Excellent.
What are we watching?

404
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,850
Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

405
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,080
Tell me, what channel's on?

406
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,220
Five.

407
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,600
Alright.

408
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,710
What did you do at school today?

409
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:14,710
Nothing. I don't know.
Nothing.

410
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,740
It can't be nothing.

411
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,510
Something must've happened.

412
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,220
Ok you know those
science fiction movies

413
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,310
Star Trek, Star Wars

414
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,020
they need an exotic location to shoot,

415
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,020
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know?

416
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,620
Now image this.

417
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,200
They're a Canadian film crew on a
location scout for a science fiction movie.

418
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,940
We put it out there.

419
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:57,940
The Canadian producers
put it out there.

420
00:22:58,050 --> 00:22:59,340
They were looking at Egypt

421
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,480
Istanbul.

422
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,740
Then

423
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,740
we go to the Consulate
and say, 'Hey

424
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,170
we want to look in Iran too'.

425
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:06,880
I fly into Tehran

426
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,880
We all fly out together
as a film crew.

427
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:10,000
Done.

428
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,800
Flamboyant cover identity

429
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,310
should be avoided as it
increases operational visibility

430
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,000
This is a lot more plausible than foreigners
who wanna be teachers in Iran.

431
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,480
You want to blend in with the population

432
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,710
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

433
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,200
Just gonna wake up
tomorrow morning

434
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,540
and be in the movie business?

435
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,370
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

436
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,850
No Sir, we have a contact in...

437
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:26,370
Chambers

438
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,250
John Chambers

439
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,510
He's a Hollywood prostetics guy

440
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,940
he's got an Oscar,
he did Planet of the Apes

441
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,940
he's done a bunch of
contract work for us in the past.

442
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,620
I go see him.

443
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,680
He sets this up.

444
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,770
One, two days,
make it look real.

445
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,280
I went outside for thirty seconds.

446
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,020
Alright?

447
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,910
Could you give me a break?
I can't breath in this house.

448
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,970
I need some fresh air,
I can't...I can't breath!

449
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,220
Stay inside the fucking house!

450
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,220
- Who saw me go outside? Just curious.
- That's not the point.

451
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,220
That's not the point Bob.

452
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,340
You see me?
Did you see me go out?

453
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:04,680
No!

454
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,770
- You did go outside...
- I did!

455
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,000
Okay! I saw you.

456
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,140
Bob it only takes one
second for them to spot you.

457
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,220
Some Americans are missing.

458
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,000
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

459
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,970
The numbers don't match

460
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,650
Finish assembling the
pictures from the Embassy.

461
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:28,280
All I need is their
faces to find them.

462
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:30,140
Yes Sir, it'll be done.

463
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,020
We want you to go to LA.

464
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,200
If you can make the movie thing
credible, we'll take it to the director.

465
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,200
Don't fuck up.

466
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,680
The whole country is watching you.

467
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,910
They just don't know it.

468
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,200
My creation

469
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,710
My creation!

470
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,280
What the fuck Bryan?

471
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,080
Cut!

472
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,910
We are cutting!

473
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,540
Chambers!

474
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,540
John Chambers make up.

475
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,910
He says the minotaur prosthetic
is too tight so he can't act.

476
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:40,020
If he could act he wouldn't
be playing a minotaur.

477
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,340
Mr. Chambers.

478
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:49,340
Kevin Arkins.

479
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,710
Hey Tony.

480
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,220
What are you shooting?

481
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,220
Monster movie.

482
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,600
Yeah? Is it any good?

483
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:27,940
Target audience will hate it.

484
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,940
Who's the target audience?

485
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,000
People with eyes.

486
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,170
Talk to me.

487
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,480
It's an exfil.

488
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,740
From where?

489
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,800
Worst place you can think of.

490
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,800
Universal Studio.

491
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,680
How are you gonna
get in the Embassy?

492
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,940
They're not in the Embassy.

493
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,250
During the takeover
six people escaped.

494
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:58,250
They're hiding out in Tehran

495
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,050
and that's who
I'm going to go get.

496
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,480
What am I making?

497
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:04,710
I need you to help me
make a fake movie.

498
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:07,020
Well, you came to
the right place.

499
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:10,770
I wanna setup a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

500
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:12,770
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

501
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,910
So you wanna come to
Hollywood and act like a big shot

502
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,220
Yeah.

503
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,820
- without actually doing anything.
- No.

504
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,250
You'll fit right in.

505
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,710
Let's see.

506
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,420
Well this one got
an M.A in English

507
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,080
she should be your screenwriter.

508
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,250
Sometimes they go on scouts,
cause they want their free meals.

509
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,770
Here's your director.

510
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,340
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

511
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,050
You can teach a recess monkey
to be a director in a day.

512
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,050
Look if you're gonna do this

513
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,540
you gotta do it

514
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,170
The Kominiacs are fruit loops
but they got cousins

515
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,910
who sell prayer rugs
and 8-tracks on Le Brea.

516
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,940
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

517
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,910
You need a script

518
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,280
you need a producer.

519
00:27:56,370 --> 00:27:57,310
Make me a producer.

520
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:00,250
No. You're...an
associate producer at best.

521
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:04,800
You're gonna do a 20 million
dollars Star Wars ripoff.

522
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,050
You need somebody
who's a somebody,

523
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,510
to put their name on it.

524
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,510
Somebody respectable,

525
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,940
with credits,

526
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,740
who you can trust
with classified information,

527
00:28:17,850 --> 00:28:19,910
who'd produce a fake movie,

528
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,910
for free.

529
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,280
Hi. I only got
a couple of minutes.

530
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:39,050
I'm getting a lifetime
achievement award.

531
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,370
Mazel tov, Lester.

532
00:28:40,770 --> 00:28:44,140
I'll rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

533
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,680
Okay.

534
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,110
You got six people hiding out
in a town of what...

535
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:49,770
4 million people,
all of whom

536
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,710
chant 'death to America'
all the live long day.

537
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,680
You want to set up
a movie in a week.

538
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:58,200
You want to lie to Hollywood, a town
where everybody lies for a living

539
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:00,910
Then you're gonna
sneak 007 over here

540
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,450
into a country that wants CIA
blood on their breakfast cereal

541
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,110
and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

542
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,250
That's about hundred
militia at the airport.

543
00:29:10,370 --> 00:29:11,110
That's right.

544
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,570
Right.

545
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:16,370
Look I...

546
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,310
I got to tell ya

547
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:21,200
We...we did suicide missions in the
Army that had better odds than this.

548
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,710
Sir, the car is here.

549
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:33,280
You ever think, Lester,
this is all for the camera's?

550
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,600
Well, they're getting the ratings.
I'll say that for them.

551
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:50,310
We're going to need a script.

552
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,740
I love you.

553
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,600
Sahar,

554
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:33,880
how are you doing?

555
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,080
Fine, thank you.

556
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,450
Your friends...

557
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,820
from Canada, ma'am,
all this time, they never go out.

558
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,170
Sahar knows.

559
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,370
How about 'The Horses of Achilles'?

560
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,310
No good.

561
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:07,310
Nobody does westerns anymore.

562
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
It's ancient Troy

563
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,820
If it's got horses in it,
it's a western.

564
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,110
Hey, Kenny please?

565
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:15,370
Yeah it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

566
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,510
It doesn't matter.

567
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:17,940
It's a fake movie.

568
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,620
If I'm doing a fake movie,

569
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,940
it's going to be a fake hit.

570
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,800
Cardinal wants all cover options

571
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,480
on his desk Friday morning.

572
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,620
Engell's prepping
the bikes option,

573
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,050
teachers option.

574
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,480
You have 72 hours
to make yours better.

575
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,480
Fine.

576
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,600
Hey is 8006

577
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,000
still on the open list?

578
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,340
Yeah I'll hold.

579
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,450
Fade in on a starship landing

580
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:08,650
an exotic Middle Eastern vibe.

581
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,740
Women gather offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

582
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:13,970
Argo.

583
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,770
"A Science-Fantasy Adventure."

584
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,340
It's a turnaround, it's dog shit.

585
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,910
It's a space movie
in the Middle East.

586
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:20,600
Does it matter if...?

587
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:21,740
Could we get the option?

588
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,710
Why do we need the option?

589
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,710
You're worry about the Ayatollah?

590
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,710
Try the WGA.

591
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,200
Just let me do the talking.

592
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,770
I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit,

593
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,620
and he comes on hard,
but uh...

594
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,850
I can handle it.

595
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:41,200
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

596
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,940
Up like a carny ride.

597
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,020
One month, yeah.

598
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:44,880
Who are you again?

599
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,680
Kevin Arkins, Studio 6 Films.

600
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,620
He's the money.

601
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:48,970
Look.

602
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,250
What do you say you uh...

603
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:53,770
fifteen thou and,
let's close on this?

604
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,110
You want me to be
honest with you, Les?

605
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,480
No. I would like
you to bullshit me, Max.

606
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:00,600
Alright.

607
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,050
I enjoyed your films.

608
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,000
The early ones.

609
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:05,680
I took this meeting

610
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:08,740
out of respect, because
I wanted to say no to your face.

611
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:10,570
Thank you.

612
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,820
Very respectful.

613
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,450
You're finished, Lester.

614
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,420
Get your cataracts fixed,
read the trades.

615
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,540
MGM just capitalized
for six new films.

616
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,680
They're screaming for Sci-Fi.

617
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,020
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

618
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,510
Well...
What can I say?

619
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,770
Congratulations.

620
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,140
But see,

621
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,000
it kind of worries me
what you said.

622
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,310
Let me tell you why.

623
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,000
Couple of weeks ago I was sitting
at Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a mai tai,

624
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,820
when my pal,
Warren Beatty comes in,

625
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,170
he wishes me well,
we have a little chat.

626
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,420
Seems he was attached
to star in 'Zulu Empire',

627
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,800
which is gonna anchored at MGM slate.

628
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,170
But Warren confided in me that 
the picture's gone over budget

629
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:58,250
because the Zulu extras
want to unionize.

630
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,710
They may be cannibals,

631
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,450
but they want health and
dental so the movie's kaput.

632
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:03,570
Which means

633
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:06,000
That the MGM deal
ain't goinna happen

634
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,200
and your script ain't worth
a buffalo shit on a nickel!

635
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,220
So.

636
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,280
The way it looks to me
through the cataracts I grant you,

637
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,280
is that you can
either sign here

638
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:18,400
and take 10,000 dollars
for your toilet-paper script,

639
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:20,400
or you can go fuck yourself!

640
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,170
With all due respect.

641
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,340
You really know Warrent Beatty?

642
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,540
Yes I do.

643
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,940
I took a leak next to him
once at the Golder Globes.

644
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:36,940
Taco?

645
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,050
Got any kids, Lester?

646
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,110
Yeah, I have two daughters.

647
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,680
See 'em much?

648
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,250
I talk to them once a year,

649
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,710
maybe.

650
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,650
Why is that?

651
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,140
I was a terrible father.

652
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,880
The bullshit business

653
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,650
it's like coal mining.

654
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,370
You...you come home
to your wife and kids

655
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,370
you can't...you can't
wash it off.

656
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:24,910
You?

657
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:27,800
Yeah I got a son.

658
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:31,220
He lives in Virgina
with his mother.

659
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,370
You're divorced?

660
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,620
Taking time off.

661
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,480
He needs to be...

662
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,620
...where he is.

663
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:48,450
Kids need the mother.

664
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,910
They caught the Shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

665
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,140
Listen

666
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,200
since the incident, the number
of guards at the airport has doubled.

667
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:11,710
A thorough background
examination should be expected.

668
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:13,020
The movie cover isn't
strong enough yet.

669
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,820
I need another week, Jack.

670
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,050
You don't have it.

671
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,510
We got an office,

672
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,200
we got business cards,

673
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:24,600
we got a poster.

674
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:28,910
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, there's 
nothing we couldn't made at home.

675
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:31,510
Six people's lives depend on this.

676
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:33,850
It's not enough.

677
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,400
If we're gonna fool this peole

678
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:36,880
it has to be big,

679
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,540
it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

680
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,600
I did a movie with
Rock Hudson one time.

681
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,310
If you want to sell a lie...

682
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:50,940
Get the press
to sell it for you.

683
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:52,480
No, no, no!

684
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,510
Press event, then they're
going to read through the script.

685
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,650
I got a bunch of actors who are gonna read
from beginning to end, all the way through.

686
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:01,800
They have
costumes and everything.

687
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,540
No, no, no! I can't!
I got...

688
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,740
Variety has the exclusive on that.

689
00:37:05,820 --> 00:37:06,820
Is there any way
to make this...

690
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:09,080
more uh...Middle Eastern?

691
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,420
Mesopotamia?
Egypt?

692
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,620
Iran.

693
00:37:12,650 --> 00:37:16,340
Look, I can get you in, but you
gotta promise me at least half a page.

694
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,340
No, no!
This thing's an event,

695
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,740
it's going to be a spectacle.

696
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,310
Lester.

697
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,400
Nina, you look fabulous.

698
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,620
You doing the reading?

699
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,940
I'm playing Serksi
the Galactic Witch.

700
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,370
Great, I'll call ya.

701
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,140
Keep that fucking space
witch away from me.

702
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,220
You know her?

703
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,650
I was married to her.

704
00:38:37,770 --> 00:38:39,650
Oh my God!
Iraq is amazing!

705
00:38:39,710 --> 00:38:40,710
Well, we're shooting in Iran.

706
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,340
Ira with an N?

707
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,000
Yeah.
We're very excited.

708
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,480
You ever watch the news?

709
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:47,480
What does the title refer to?

710
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,480
The Argo!

711
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,480
The thing...

712
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,650
Like Jason and the
Golden Fleece, or what?

713
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:54,820
No, no! It's the ship,
it's the spaceship,

714
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:58,250
it goes...it goes everywhere.
It goes all...

715
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:00,250
...all throughout space.

716
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,600
So it's the Argonaut?

717
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:02,970
No.

718
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,450
What does Argo mean?

719
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
I don't know.

720
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,600
You don't know?

721
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,310
It means Argo fuck yourself!
