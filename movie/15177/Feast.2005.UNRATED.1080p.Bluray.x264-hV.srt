1
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,101
- Asshole!
- Look out, Bozo!

2
00:02:13,334 --> 00:02:15,029
Hey. Hey. Hey!

3
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,262
What?!

4
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,612
Shut up, fag.

5
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,884
The friggin' maids took my laptop.
I'm talkin' about <i>everything.</i>

6
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,323
I've got fourteen quality leads
waiting for me in that area.

7
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,316
Yeah.

8
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,829
No. They're with Packard, bro.

9
00:02:43,898 --> 00:02:45,331
Hewlett-Pack...

10
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,771
Wake up!

11
00:02:53,841 --> 00:02:56,674
Ohh! Just get outta here.

12
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,645
Hey, uh, how much
for the whole night, Grandma?

13
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,973
You should be so lucky.

14
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:06,611
- Oooh... hot for teacher.
- Oh, you little...

15
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:07,984
God <i>damn.</i>

16
00:03:20,234 --> 00:03:23,829
Dude you're late.
I have to leave in a half hour.

17
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:26,930
Don't dilly-dally, then.
Rack 'em.

18
00:03:27,007 --> 00:03:31,535
Dilly-dally. I'll just dilly-dally over
and grab that money from you.

19
00:03:52,766 --> 00:03:53,926
Damn!

20
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,532
I mean, we've been
going out for years,

21
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:00,540
and all of a sudden... bang... she drops me.

22
00:04:07,381 --> 00:04:11,681
No, I'm not saying I ever <i>had</i> it,
but I've definitely lost it.

23
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,819
I mean, I used to be a model.

24
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:16,515
J.C. Penney. Springwear.

25
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,684
Yeah. See? See, look.

26
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:20,988
Look. See?

27
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,820
- That was one of my model things.
- Oh. Yeah.

28
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,263
It might not look like it now...

29
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:29,268
that's 'cause I'm wearing work clothes,
so it doesn't really fit, you know,

30
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:33,033
but if I was wearing my modeling clothes,
trust me, I'd look like a model.

31
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,506
Yeah, yeah, you're full of shit.

32
00:04:34,575 --> 00:04:36,008
You know, Chach...

33
00:04:37,011 --> 00:04:39,070
I take the rubble of man...

34
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:42,638
and I build superstars.

35
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:45,514
Come on, man.
Fuck that shit.

36
00:04:54,228 --> 00:04:56,253
I don't want no brochures
in here, man.

37
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:59,356
I mean, this guy,
he gets an open tab all the time here.

38
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,627
Watch. Watch. Watch.

39
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:04,637
Amen, Brother Ben.
Shot a rooster, killed a hen.

40
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:08,607
Now, that's Hollywood talk.
That's showbiz, brother.

41
00:05:08,676 --> 00:05:10,405
If you change your mind.

42
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,771
If you're gonna
hang around a while, that's great.

43
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:14,148
- But you gotta move your truck.
- Yeah. No, I hear ya.

44
00:05:14,183 --> 00:05:17,083
- But you gotta move your truck.
- Yeah. No, I hear ya.

45
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:21,618
I keep forgettin'.

46
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,020
This place is hoppin'.

47
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:01,789
Oh, no. Listen, your money
can't buy shit here, Sergeant.

48
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:05,059
- Well, thank you.
- Semper fi, man.

49
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,532
- Where you headed?
- I'm goin' home.

50
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,068
- Yeah?
- I'm gonna go home,

51
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:10,865
kiss my wife,

52
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:13,270
be back on the front lines
as soon as they'll have me.

53
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,106
- That's truly righteous, man.
- You don't know my wife.

54
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,883
Ohh.

55
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:42,665
Evenin'.

56
00:06:42,736 --> 00:06:45,705
Oh, I was... I was, uh...
I was just lookin' for ya.

57
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,035
Zip it, shitbox.

58
00:06:47,107 --> 00:06:49,200
You dropped off the beer.
Now take a hike.

59
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:51,267
Okay.
- Now! Now!

60
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,504
Ohh, man.

61
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,623
Goddamn dirt weed.

62
00:07:18,305 --> 00:07:22,036
Rum and Coke...
without the Coke.

63
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,974
Keep it.

64
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,673
Not from around here, are ya?

65
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:31,445
- What gave me away?
- You have all your teeth.

66
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,288
Can I buy you a drink?
- Yeah.

67
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:45,263
I'm off in five.

68
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:57,567
Whisky shooter, please.

69
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,510
Which tab?

70
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,695
Mine.

71
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:51,062
- Hey, watch it there, buddy.
- Jeez, dude, I'm playing a game.

72
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:53,964
- Well, so am I.
- Yeah, mine's for real money, though.

73
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,865
That's all she wrote.

74
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,133
What the fuck!

75
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,641
Oh!

76
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:05,772
- That's a rough one.
- That is fucking impossible!

77
00:09:05,846 --> 00:09:09,612
Don't get your panties in a bunch.
Want to go again?

78
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,742
- Goddamnit, no!
- Come on.

79
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:12,944
"Crap-ay" diem!

80
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:15,620
Fuckin' pussy.

81
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,122
Anybody wanna go?

82
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:25,056
Mom, when are we going home?

83
00:09:28,068 --> 00:09:29,592
After my meeting.

84
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,332
<i>Come on, baby, let's rock and roll.</i>

85
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,940
Okay. You know the drill.

86
00:09:36,944 --> 00:09:38,775
Keep these on.

87
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:41,837
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>I can't do this by myself, honey.</i>

88
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,007
<i>Now!</i>

89
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:55,558
Come on. Take you to your car.

90
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:58,530
Not tonight.
I have an escort.

91
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,603
Eighteen bucks, pal.

92
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:19,678
I guess I'll hold on to this.

93
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,557
Ah! Ah, shit!

94
00:10:34,635 --> 00:10:37,103
Shit! <i>Shit!</i>

95
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:47,708
Ohh! <i>Ohh!</i>

96
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:51,012
Damn, baby, act like you feel it!

97
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:52,449
Ahh!

98
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:57,649
Shit <i>fire!</i>

99
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:18,768
Hey, uh, you boys want to
try your luck with the loot?

100
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,804
Come on.

101
00:11:20,881 --> 00:11:22,610
Hey, I'll use one arm.

102
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,720
Nothing but a bunch of
limp dicks and pussies in here!

103
00:11:28,789 --> 00:11:30,347
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

104
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:32,722
You shut the fuck up,
or get out.

105
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,454
No, <i>you</i> shut up, old man.

106
00:11:35,962 --> 00:11:37,793
Come on!

107
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,263
Gimme some action!

108
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,529
The fuck are you?

109
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,812
Unless you people want to die,

110
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,905
you'll do what I say
and you'll do it fast.

111
00:11:57,317 --> 00:11:58,875
Mine's bigger'n yours.

112
00:12:03,323 --> 00:12:04,551
Listen to me.

113
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:08,586
A storm of hell's comin' down
on this place any second.

114
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,730
I don't know what they are...

115
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,034
I don't know where they came from.

116
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:20,301
All I do know is that these fuckers
are fast, nasty, and hungry.

117
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,705
And there's four of 'em.

118
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:27,042
They got claws like Ginsu knives
and more teeth than a chainsaw.

119
00:12:31,351 --> 00:12:33,945
They're comin'.
Right now.

120
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,083
So we gotta lock this bar down.

121
00:12:39,359 --> 00:12:41,589
That means doors, windows,
drains, and zippers,

122
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,492
and we gotta do it fast.

123
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:47,294
You. Get a phone, call the cops,
National Guard, townies...

124
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:49,961
anybody who kicks ass...
and get 'em out here.

125
00:12:54,674 --> 00:12:56,733
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

126
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:58,505
Who the hell are you?

127
00:13:03,483 --> 00:13:05,747
I'm the guy
that's gonna save your ass.

128
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:09,911
Fuck.

129
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,123
Aah!

130
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:22,567
Aah!

131
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,032
Aah!

132
00:13:29,509 --> 00:13:31,101
Get down!

133
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:38,144
Where is he?
Where's my husband?

134
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:46,848
Cody?

135
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,349
Come here.

136
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:50,293
I want you to stay...

137
00:13:50,363 --> 00:13:51,694
right here.

138
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:53,756
I want you to stay in this closet
and do not move.

139
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,200
I don't care what you hear,
don't move!

140
00:14:25,432 --> 00:14:26,831
Help me, somebody.

141
00:14:36,943 --> 00:14:38,342
Aah! Aah!

142
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:52,286
Aaahh! Aaahh!

143
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:10,533
Aah!

144
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,495
Is it gone?

145
00:15:31,031 --> 00:15:32,464
What the fuck?!

146
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,762
Fuck! Fuck!

147
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:36,631
Fuckin'!

148
00:15:47,013 --> 00:15:48,640
Where's that little fucker?

149
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,426
I got it! I got it!

150
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,725
We're okay.

151
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:16,605
- Scratch that.
- Close the motherfucking shutters!

152
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,188
God damn you!

153
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,265
Beer me.

154
00:17:28,348 --> 00:17:30,578
- Is it clear?
- Unh! What the fuck?

155
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,981
Is it clear down there?

156
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:34,452
Yeah, I-I think...
I-I don't know.

157
00:17:34,521 --> 00:17:36,250
I don't know, boss.

158
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,222
Is there a gun pointed at you?

159
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,555
No. No, I got...
I got the judge, see?

160
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:44,825
All right, nobody
moves down there. Nobody!

161
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,263
Shit.

162
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:56,832
All right, goddamnit! Who shot me?

163
00:17:56,910 --> 00:18:00,437
Oww! Fuck!
Who did it?!

164
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,578
What are you idiots looking at?
My goddamn foot's blown off here!

165
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:07,813
Who shot me?

166
00:18:07,887 --> 00:18:08,945
Her fella.

167
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:10,250
My husband.

168
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,691
Where is the son of a bitch?

169
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:16,254
He's dead.

170
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:17,318
What?

171
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:24,393
What the fuck happened down here?

172
00:18:24,471 --> 00:18:25,665
What? What?

173
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:26,727
Look, it wasn't me, all right?

174
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,967
It was a f-fucking monster
or something!

175
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:31,171
I-I didn't do nothin'.

176
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,575
One of their heads is over here.

177
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,277
Ow!

178
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,454
Yeah, that's...

179
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,922
that's definitely one for the wall.

180
00:18:44,991 --> 00:18:47,755
Oh, my God.
What is that thing?

181
00:18:47,827 --> 00:18:49,590
I have no...
I don't know.

182
00:18:49,662 --> 00:18:52,460
I don't even know how I got here.
They were so fast.

183
00:18:52,532 --> 00:18:57,526
That head used to be attached
to some huge, twisted body

184
00:18:57,604 --> 00:19:01,870
like a rotting jackal or something,
like something out of a nightmare.

185
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,136
Of all the bars to be stuck in.

186
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,541
Anything else?

187
00:19:05,612 --> 00:19:08,638
Yeah. We need to lock
this place down completely.

188
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,546
- Is everybody downstairs?
- My son...

189
00:19:10,617 --> 00:19:12,244
- My son's upstairs!
- Wait! Stop her!

190
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:13,307
Cody!

191
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,146
Cody!

192
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:17,211
Cody?

193
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,889
- Oh, God, no!
- Mommy?

194
00:19:22,962 --> 00:19:27,296
Cody! I am never gonna
let you be alone again.

195
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:29,062
All right, look,
we gotta lock this place up.

196
00:19:29,135 --> 00:19:30,727
Look, come here.
You okay?

197
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:33,169
Yeah?
I'm so sorry.

198
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:34,831
I am never gonna let you...

199
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:50,948
Aaaah!

200
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,957
Aah! Get it off me!

201
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,262
Aah! God!

202
00:20:09,776 --> 00:20:11,971
No!

203
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,342
No!

204
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:16,644
No!

205
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:18,980
No!

206
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:21,452
No!

207
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:29,192
No! No!

208
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,222
No!

209
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,487
Fuck! Aw!

210
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,822
Aw, God!

211
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:05,063
Somebody help me, man!

212
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:06,860
God damn! Ow!

213
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,128
Burnin', man! Shit!

214
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:11,136
Get this shit off me, man!

215
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:12,193
- Come on in...
- Fuck!

216
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:14,035
Come on, I got a sink in here.
Come on.

217
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,574
- Come on.
- Where'd he go, man?

218
00:21:15,642 --> 00:21:18,668
All right. Ohh!

219
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,776
God! Aah!

220
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,222
Was that the only phone?

221
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,352
Yep.

222
00:21:35,428 --> 00:21:36,759
What about cell phones?

223
00:21:36,829 --> 00:21:39,627
This is canyon country, honey.
It ain't gonna happen.

224
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:43,066
Well, we've got to
have <i>something</i> here, right?

225
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,128
Just relax.
I've got a shortwave radio.

226
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,868
Except it's...

227
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,966
upstairs there, somewhere.

228
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,475
This is bullshit.

229
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,279
What did you say to me?

230
00:21:59,419 --> 00:22:00,886
I didn't say anything, Flo.

231
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,024
How you doin', buddy?
You holdin' up?

232
00:22:07,093 --> 00:22:09,084
Bad! I'm doin' bad!

233
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:10,493
- Fuck!
- It's green.

234
00:22:10,563 --> 00:22:12,053
Yeah, I know!

235
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,689
You got any more water pressure?

236
00:22:13,766 --> 00:22:15,734
- No, that's all it's got.
- Aw, fuck!

237
00:22:15,802 --> 00:22:17,793
God, your sink sucks!

238
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:23,005
Oh, fu... oww!
The stuff's up my nose, man!

239
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,512
Can you... can you feel it?

240
00:22:27,447 --> 00:22:30,780
Just calm down, you goddamn pussy.
You're all right.

241
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,183
I gotta go to the hospital, man.
I gotta fuckin' leave, man.

242
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:38,155
I need a doctor, man.
I'm outta here.

243
00:22:38,224 --> 00:22:40,715
I'm goin' to the hospital.
I'm gettin' my truck. I'm goin'.

244
00:22:40,793 --> 00:22:42,920
- Just calm down, okay?
- No, <i>you</i> calm down.

245
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,036
Now, you can risk your life,
but not mine.

246
00:22:54,107 --> 00:22:56,337
My daughter is out there
waiting for me.

247
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,900
I have just as much reason
to get out of this place as you do.

248
00:22:58,978 --> 00:23:00,912
But I also have
the common fuckin' sense to know

249
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,778
that staying alive means
being in here and not out there.

250
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,943
Do you understand?

251
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,383
Do you understand me?!

252
00:23:07,453 --> 00:23:10,286
Yeah... yeah. Got... got ya. Got ya.

253
00:23:10,356 --> 00:23:12,119
Pull that tough-guy shit again,

254
00:23:12,191 --> 00:23:15,024
I will slice you from your neck
to your nuts.

255
00:23:15,094 --> 00:23:17,619
This is bullshit, man.
You can't keep me here.

256
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,393
You fuckers can't keep me here, man!
This is bullshit.

257
00:23:20,466 --> 00:23:22,593
This is fuckin' bullshit!

258
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,499
This is bullshit, man!

259
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,231
Fuck this.

260
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,467
...this shit off of me <i>myself!</i>

261
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,997
Act like you've had some.

262
00:23:57,103 --> 00:24:00,072
- Oh, I've had some, baby.
- I haven't.

263
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,840
Oh, God.

264
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,410
That's gonna stain.

265
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,191
We can't risk letting them in.

266
00:24:29,335 --> 00:24:32,202
Have they left? It's quiet.

267
00:24:32,271 --> 00:24:34,171
No, they're still out there.

268
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,901
They're just listening to us.

269
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,705
We gotta start
clearin' these bodies up.

270
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,617
Jesus Christ.

271
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,594
Oh, shit! Fuck!

272
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:59,756
- Come on! Come on!
- Easy, bud.

273
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:02,699
It's just a death rattle.

274
00:25:02,768 --> 00:25:05,794
He's gone, he just ain't done
movin' yet.

275
00:25:05,872 --> 00:25:09,899
Let's wrap 'em up in tablecloths
and dump 'em in the basement.

276
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,168
All right?

277
00:25:15,448 --> 00:25:18,508
- All right?
- All right.

278
00:25:18,584 --> 00:25:21,280
Let's lock this place down.

279
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:32,483
- Boo!
- Shit.

280
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:42,754
It's hungry again!
It's gonna eat us!

281
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,127
Just calm down, okay?
We have to kill this thing.

282
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,094
Fire in the hole.

283
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:14,259
How you like that,
you little bastard?

284
00:28:14,326 --> 00:28:15,623
Ow!

285
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:19,926
God bless guns.

286
00:28:20,332 --> 00:28:21,629
Aaahh!

287
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:27,605
Get this fuckin' thing off me!

288
00:28:34,146 --> 00:28:35,613
Aah!

289
00:28:42,121 --> 00:28:43,554
Okay.

290
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,427
Jeez...

291
00:28:56,502 --> 00:28:58,732
it took all that?

292
00:28:58,804 --> 00:29:01,034
- All those bullets?
- That's the <i>little</i> one?!

293
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:04,099
We can't kill these things!
No way!

294
00:29:04,176 --> 00:29:06,041
Look, we <i>have</i> to fight these things.

295
00:29:06,112 --> 00:29:08,444
We just have to be clever
about this, okay?

296
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:11,312
Maybe we don't need to
fight them at all.

297
00:29:11,383 --> 00:29:13,943
Yeah. Why don't we
just call them names?

298
00:29:15,054 --> 00:29:16,316
Fuckin' genius.

299
00:29:16,388 --> 00:29:19,721
We're stuck here...
I can see this.

300
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:24,957
But what we need to do
is think outside the box.

301
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,329
We don't need to fight them.
We need to <i>scare</i> them.

302
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,834
We need to scare them back.

303
00:29:30,903 --> 00:29:33,098
This...

304
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:37,041
...is a species stand-off.

305
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:41,307
We just need to show them
that we are not vulnerable.

306
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,508
That we... are <i>formidable.</i>

307
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:47,913
How?

308
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:52,514
I need a stick.

309
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,388
Open up that ice chest.

310
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,096
God damn.

311
00:30:10,442 --> 00:30:11,875
Oh, shit.

312
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,217
All right,
give me some room.

313
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,588
It's <i>gross.</i>

314
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,492
How old do you think
that thing is?

315
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:32,554
- Take one of the planks off the window.
- No way.

316
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:36,692
Just one board. One minute.
It'll save your life. Just trust me.

317
00:30:36,769 --> 00:30:38,930
- No.
- One board.

318
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,598
One minute. Home free.

319
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:49,807
Okay. Make it quick.

320
00:30:59,725 --> 00:31:02,091
- You ready?
- Yeah.

321
00:31:02,161 --> 00:31:05,153
- Wait. What are you doing?
- Showing superiority.

322
00:31:05,231 --> 00:31:08,132
The scent of their dead
may drive them back.

323
00:31:18,077 --> 00:31:21,808
- You see 'em?
- Is there like a call or something?

324
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:26,049
Come on, you
monkey motherfuckers!

325
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:29,011
Come on!

326
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:31,454
You can't fuck with man!

327
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:38,825
Sweet.

328
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:42,022
Whoa.

329
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,968
There's two of 'em.

330
00:31:49,508 --> 00:31:52,841
It's like they're wearing
dead animals or something.

331
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,950
Hey! It's working!
You're a genius.

332
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:09,790
See? What did I tell ya?

333
00:32:09,862 --> 00:32:12,956
Wait. There's a third.

334
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:16,490
It's like a family.
It's a goddamn family.

335
00:32:16,568 --> 00:32:19,230
And we just killed their baby.

336
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:29,539
Holy shit! She <i>ate</i> it!

337
00:32:29,615 --> 00:32:32,641
She didn't even chew it, man.
She just swallowed it.

338
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,010
Oh, dear.

339
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:37,680
What? What's he doing?

340
00:32:37,756 --> 00:32:39,189
They're humpin'!

341
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,856
Oh, man.

342
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:46,830
The monsters are
doin' it doggie-style.

343
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:48,389
Monster sex.

344
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:58,834
Where you goin', boss?
You be careful, boss.

345
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,638
What is that?

346
00:33:05,584 --> 00:33:07,245
Dude... took a dump.

347
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,914
No... it's moving, stupid.

348
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:15,154
Ohh... spread out.

349
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,096
God almighty!

350
00:33:19,164 --> 00:33:21,394
It's one of the little bastards.

351
00:33:33,012 --> 00:33:35,310
Any more ideas,
Animal Planet?

352
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,780
I was just bein' proactive.

353
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:39,409
Hey, dipshit.
I didn't see you workin', did I?

354
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,350
Oh, go douche, Grandpa.

355
00:33:42,454 --> 00:33:42,521
Well, what now? Huh?!

356
00:33:42,556 --> 00:33:46,355
Well, what now? Huh?!

357
00:33:46,425 --> 00:33:48,416
We're stuck in here, that's what.

358
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:50,962
If you don't mind me askin'...

359
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,828
how'd you run into these things?

360
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,866
<i>We dropped our daughter off</i>
<i>at my mom's house...</i>

361
00:34:04,943 --> 00:34:08,709
<i>my little girl Charlie. My baby.</i>

362
00:34:08,781 --> 00:34:10,976
<i>It was only for the night.</i>

363
00:34:16,121 --> 00:34:18,681
<i>Then suddenly... we hit it.</i>

364
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:24,394
<i>We lost control of the car.</i>
<i>It spun and flipped.</i>

365
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:27,888
<i>And I was thrown from the car.</i>

366
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:31,232
<i>Its head was in the road.</i>

367
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:36,164
<i>That's when they came.</i>

368
00:34:41,013 --> 00:34:43,106
It's road-kill revenge.

369
00:34:44,483 --> 00:34:48,613
Well, I'd like to be the first
to thank you and your dead husband

370
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:50,780
for draggin' this fuck fest
into my tavern.

371
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:53,984
The only thing we brought here
was a heads-up that saved your ass.

372
00:34:54,059 --> 00:34:55,924
This is not my fault.

373
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:59,826
You pissed off the wrong clan, lady.

374
00:35:00,966 --> 00:35:03,230
Maybe all they want's you.

375
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:07,432
Maybe all they want's the person that
ran over their old granddaddy in a car.

376
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:10,134
And maybe they can have you
on a silver platter,

377
00:35:10,209 --> 00:35:11,676
apple in fuckin' mouth.

378
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,337
You shoulda thought of that
before we killed their child

379
00:35:15,414 --> 00:35:17,075
and stuck it outside on a pike.

380
00:35:18,083 --> 00:35:19,880
No need to get menstrual.

381
00:35:21,053 --> 00:35:24,648
That was a dumb fuckin' idea, man.

382
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,384
Ow! Shit!

383
00:35:26,458 --> 00:35:27,720
Fuck!

384
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:31,752
What the fuck's happening, man?!
What the fuck is this shit?!

385
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,559
Just don't touch it, okay?
Leave it alone.

386
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,497
- You're making it worse.
- You tell me to leave it alone?

387
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,626
You get puked on by a monster

388
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:39,933
and you tell me
how that feels, huh?

389
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,974
I'm rottin' here, and nobody
could give a shit!

390
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:45,566
I'm dying, all right?!

391
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,839
I'm fuckin' dying!

392
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,972
I am upper-case fucked!

393
00:35:50,048 --> 00:35:52,016
You don't give a shit, man!

394
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:53,949
You don't give a shit, either!

395
00:35:54,019 --> 00:35:56,510
All you guys don't fuckin'
care about me!

396
00:35:56,588 --> 00:35:59,614
I <i>don't</i> care.
Go suffer somewhere else.

397
00:36:01,126 --> 00:36:03,321
Get the fuck away from me.

398
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:07,491
Ohh, God! Fuck, that hurts!

399
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:11,468
Look, somebody's got
to know <i>something</i> about this.

400
00:36:13,138 --> 00:36:15,629
This stuff doesn't just
happen out of the blue.

401
00:36:18,911 --> 00:36:20,435
You.

402
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:22,275
What?

403
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:25,111
- You know something.
- Huh?

404
00:36:25,184 --> 00:36:29,086
- Yeah, you're old. You've seen things.
- I don't know anything.

405
00:36:29,154 --> 00:36:31,054
- Easy, cowboy.
- Hey, back off me, Whitey!

406
00:36:31,123 --> 00:36:32,954
I'm interrogating her.

407
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,890
She's old.
Old people know things,

408
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,894
like legends and tall tales and shit.

409
00:36:36,962 --> 00:36:41,228
No. No. Really,
I don't know anything.

410
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,289
Come on, spill it.

411
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:46,201
- Spill it, or I'll get rough.
- I don't know anything!

412
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,705
Why don't you ask him?
He's old.

413
00:36:48,774 --> 00:36:51,607
- Start diggin'.
- Ahh, sheesh.

414
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:53,872
Back off.
She doesn't know anything.

415
00:36:53,946 --> 00:36:55,880
Yeah, <i>allegedly.</i>

416
00:36:55,948 --> 00:36:57,848
It doesn't matter where
they fucking came from.

417
00:36:57,916 --> 00:37:01,784
They're here. Either we kill them
or they kill us. That's it.

418
00:37:01,853 --> 00:37:04,879
Hey, no offense, Xena...

419
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:08,586
but by the way things are going,
looks like we need another chief,

420
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,924
somebody that knows
the lay of the land,

421
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:13,089
somebody with a little moxie.

422
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,025
Somebody like myself.

423
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:27,970
Aah.
- Careful.

424
00:37:29,114 --> 00:37:30,706
I think we're gonna be all right.

425
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:32,943
I think we're gonna be okay, guys.

426
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,245
Ohh!

427
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:43,894
Yeah. I think we're
gonna be all right.

428
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:49,127
This is just some leaky barrel
radiation toxic dump waste

429
00:37:49,201 --> 00:37:53,865
enviro-crap freak-beast accident
that crawled out of the sewer, man.

430
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,567
That's all this is.
We're gonna be all right.

431
00:37:56,642 --> 00:38:00,271
I think the experts, they're gonna be
showin' up any minute to fix this up.

432
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,779
You know, some of those green guys?

433
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:05,373
Those guys with
the real can-do attitude and the tanks

434
00:38:05,450 --> 00:38:08,078
and M-16s and torpedoes and...

435
00:38:08,153 --> 00:38:10,280
Hey! Can you just give it a break?

436
00:38:10,355 --> 00:38:13,756
Those guys are en <i>route.</i>
You hear 'em?

437
00:38:19,197 --> 00:38:20,926
They're comin'.

438
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:23,627
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Yeah, be careful.

439
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:27,536
I don't see a thing.
I can't see a thing.

440
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,100
Aah! Aah!

441
00:38:42,287 --> 00:38:44,084
Give me my eye back!

442
00:39:04,309 --> 00:39:06,709
- Jeez!
<i>- Oh.</i>

443
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:11,016
Hmm. Ahem.

444
00:39:11,051 --> 00:39:12,643
Hmm. Ahem.

445
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:15,710
Does everyone agree
that the monsters are still out there?

446
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:19,382
Huh, chief?
- Yeah, no <i>shit,</i> Sherlock.

447
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,859
I have some sweats
behind the bar in a... in a bag.

448
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,227
Tha-thank you.

449
00:40:02,868 --> 00:40:05,462
- They coordinated that strike.
- Yeah, I know.

450
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,973
- I'm gonna need more shells.
- Yeah, tell me about it, missy.

451
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,406
A.45's got six shots.

452
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,706
I got two refills.

453
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:18,375
In my locker in the basement I got...

454
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:20,884
...I got maybe some more shells.

455
00:40:22,954 --> 00:40:24,319
Ah!

456
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:26,550
Jeez.

457
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:29,685
And... I got this.

458
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:45,638
Shhh...

459
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:46,836
...shit.

460
00:40:48,013 --> 00:40:50,914
Honey, why don't you just
leave the offense to us?

461
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:54,349
You need a whole lot more than that
to get out of here alive.

462
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,580
Oh, <i>now</i> you got
somethin' to say.

463
00:40:56,655 --> 00:41:00,887
You young'uns.
You worry about weapons.

464
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,360
- I'm thinkin' strategy.
- Oh. And what's that?

465
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:07,865
Sit still...
and look less like a meal.

466
00:41:07,933 --> 00:41:11,391
That's for bears and sharks,
Chunky Chew.

467
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,064
How do you tolerate him?

468
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,767
He's an ass, but he's my brother.

469
00:41:16,842 --> 00:41:20,039
I've stood everywhere. Nothin'.

470
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:22,170
Didn't you say you had a radio?

471
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:25,876
Upstairs, back of my closet.
Little slidin' door.

472
00:41:25,951 --> 00:41:30,320
Channel 9's the emergency frequency.

473
00:41:30,388 --> 00:41:31,855
Have fun.

474
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:35,984
All right. I'm gonna go
to the basement for supplies.

475
00:41:36,061 --> 00:41:38,962
And you... you're going upstairs.

476
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,361
Heh.

477
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:43,333
Let's not get carried away.

478
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:46,199
Step up, chief.
Ain't you got a pair?

479
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:51,006
Watch it.

480
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,471
Yeah.

481
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,106
Okay, yeah. Shotgun.

482
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,116
All right, partner,
you're comin' with me.

483
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,345
Whoa. I don't know about that, bub.

484
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:04,115
I mean, I ain't exactly
no Billy the Kid.

485
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,214
Yeah, but you're slow,
and that's helpful.

486
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:09,590
Just stay close.
Who else is comin'?

487
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:11,253
I'll go with ya.

488
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,323
What are you gonna do,
throw your teeth at 'em?

489
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,526
Just sit down, Cocoon.

490
00:42:19,538 --> 00:42:22,006
You. You're comin' with me.

491
00:42:26,011 --> 00:42:27,000
Keys.

492
00:42:28,947 --> 00:42:31,040
- You're locked in.
- What?

493
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:32,879
These two will be
on the other side waiting for you.

494
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,350
If you become food,

495
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:37,115
I don't want a set of keys in the belly
of one of those things.

496
00:42:37,188 --> 00:42:39,247
Don't get your hopes up.

497
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,755
Any volunteers
for the basement?

498
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,792
I'll go.

499
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:48,324
All right. I don't want to hear
any of this "Where is the key?"

500
00:43:48,393 --> 00:43:50,861
"I dropped the key."
I want out. I want <i>out.</i>

501
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,829
You just find that fucking radio.

502
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,194
We'll get you out.

503
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:56,096
We got your front, bro.

504
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:58,533
It's your "back."
"We got your <i>back."</i>

505
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:25,724
Shit.

506
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:29,423
Okay.

507
00:44:29,501 --> 00:44:30,900
You keep that handy.

508
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,403
- You wish me luck, girls.
- All right.

509
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:47,578
I'm okay. I'm okay.

510
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,320
I'm okay! I'm okay!

511
00:44:50,855 --> 00:44:54,018
I'm okay... I'm okay.

512
00:45:12,477 --> 00:45:14,104
Come on.

513
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,443
Just breathe...

514
00:45:16,514 --> 00:45:18,277
just breathe.

515
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:22,313
Come on... come on.

516
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:43,863
Aah!

517
00:45:47,879 --> 00:45:49,744
Come on...

518
00:45:49,814 --> 00:45:51,281
just breathe.

519
00:45:55,153 --> 00:45:56,142
Unh!

520
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:30,182
Easy. Easy.

521
00:46:33,324 --> 00:46:34,916
Aah! Augh!

522
00:46:39,164 --> 00:46:42,691
It's okay! It's just a bat.

523
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:44,667
It's just a bat.

524
00:47:10,862 --> 00:47:12,659
Come on, hurry up.

525
00:47:21,573 --> 00:47:23,131
Come on, you motherfucker.

526
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,677
Hello.

527
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,807
Is anyone out there?

528
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:37,480
Look, we need help. The Bear Tavern.
Send guns. And tanks.

529
00:47:39,958 --> 00:47:41,448
Aaahhh!

530
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:44,256
I repeat! I repeat! S.O.S.!

531
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:46,092
S.O.S.! Calling all cars!

532
00:47:54,439 --> 00:47:56,839
Okay! I'm ready to come out!

533
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:59,035
<i>I'm ready to come out now!</i>

534
00:48:00,912 --> 00:48:01,901
Oh...

535
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,041
"Oh"?
What do you mean, "Oh"?!

536
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,248
Help! Help!

537
00:48:14,325 --> 00:48:16,190
Cheese and crackers.

538
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,831
Goddamnit, open up!

539
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:22,958
Come on!

540
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:25,161
The goddamn key busted.

541
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:26,794
Old man! Help!

542
00:48:28,473 --> 00:48:29,633
<i>Goddamnit, help!</i>

543
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,976
Help!

544
00:48:34,045 --> 00:48:35,034
Old man!

545
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:47,048
The monster's cock
is stuck in the door!

546
00:48:50,862 --> 00:48:51,920
Aaahhh!

547
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:56,864
Fuck!

548
00:48:56,935 --> 00:48:58,334
Help!

549
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:05,240
Shit!

550
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:14,717
I thought that was it
for a second there.

551
00:49:14,786 --> 00:49:16,344
Hold me, brother.

552
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,718
What happened?

553
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:21,782
Papa Beast got neutered, missy.

554
00:49:23,094 --> 00:49:25,221
Oh... good one.

555
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:38,336
If they can't reproduce,
then we're one step closer.

556
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:39,398
A big step.

557
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:42,410
Now is the time
to band together.

558
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:45,779
We need to rise up
against these creatures of the night.

559
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:50,378
These monsters are no match
for the human spirit.

560
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:55,415
We can do it.
We just need to believe in each other,

561
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:56,926
believe in all of us.

562
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,259
We need to make a stand.

563
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,561
Right here, right now.

564
00:50:04,869 --> 00:50:06,598
Dude...

565
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:08,935
are you gay?

566
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:15,439
Look...

567
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:19,847
those monsters were clawing
those nails out upstairs.

568
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,350
They're like Mensa monsters.

569
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:23,785
They're gonna need
a lot more than claws

570
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:25,846
to pop out these boards down here.

571
00:50:25,923 --> 00:50:28,721
They'll need a crowbar or somethin'.

572
00:51:03,027 --> 00:51:06,463
- We gotta find a way out. Now.
- I have a really good idea.

573
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:09,500
We could all run outside
to our cars

574
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,626
and we could spread out
in different directions.

575
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,329
That's a goddamn suicide trip.

576
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,895
- But if we all stick together...
- Hey, half of us can't run,

577
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:17,907
and one of us
can't even walk, hon.

578
00:51:17,975 --> 00:51:19,602
Hanging out isn't looking
too much better.

579
00:51:19,677 --> 00:51:21,338
Even I can admit that.

580
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,778
Hey. Hey. Ow.

581
00:51:23,848 --> 00:51:28,842
Hey, what about the basement
hatch door?

582
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:30,820
What about it?

583
00:51:30,888 --> 00:51:32,378
We... we could trick 'em.

584
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:37,157
That could be our... our escape.

585
00:51:37,228 --> 00:51:40,288
The... the... the monsters
don't know about it.

586
00:51:40,364 --> 00:51:43,060
It's a... it's a... it's a...
sh... sh...

587
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,568
shh... shh...

588
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:48,104
It's a sec... secret hatch.

589
00:51:48,172 --> 00:51:51,733
Oh, crap. Ohh...

590
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:57,705
Has anyone got lip balm...
I can borrow?

591
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:01,810
- Fucked up and stupid.
Look, it's true.

592
00:52:01,886 --> 00:52:04,980
If we just go out there, no matter
how quiet or fast we are, we're dead.

593
00:52:05,056 --> 00:52:07,183
But if we can draw them away
to the other side of the bar,

594
00:52:07,258 --> 00:52:08,725
we at least got a chance.

595
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:11,785
Do either of you have any...
a can of hairspray or anything?

596
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,728
Yeah, I do in my purse.

597
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:16,426
You put in some household cleaner
and some low-grade booze,

598
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:18,093
and you got yourself a distraction.

599
00:52:18,169 --> 00:52:19,659
What about a car?

600
00:52:19,737 --> 00:52:20,897
Whose car is close?

601
00:52:20,972 --> 00:52:22,906
You gonna climb
through that hatch down there?

602
00:52:22,974 --> 00:52:24,601
- Yeah.
- My truck's the closest,

603
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:26,506
but there ain't no way
it's gonna haul the whole lot.

604
00:52:26,577 --> 00:52:28,442
- Is it gassed?
- Fully.

605
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:29,775
- Four-door?
- Two.

606
00:52:29,847 --> 00:52:31,075
- How many fit?
- Six.

607
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:32,514
- Max?
- Seven.

608
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:35,017
Ten. It's gonna fit ten.

609
00:52:35,086 --> 00:52:36,951
Ten <i>clowns</i> couldn't
fit in that truck.

610
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,649
Here's a plan. Two of us go.
One to drive, one to defend.

611
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:41,248
We back up to the bar,
and tear ass out of here.

612
00:52:41,325 --> 00:52:42,986
Not good odds, missy.

613
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,223
My daughter is waiting for me.
I don't have a choice.

614
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:50,456
Okay, I'm in.

615
00:52:50,535 --> 00:52:53,402
No, ma'am. It would be an honor
to accompany you

616
00:52:53,471 --> 00:52:56,065
on this dangerous journey.

617
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:59,200
- All right.
- You're not gonna make it, hon.

618
00:52:59,277 --> 00:53:00,608
I'm sorry.

619
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:02,942
Sooner or later
that wall is coming down.

620
00:53:03,014 --> 00:53:05,346
If we stay, we die.

621
00:53:07,151 --> 00:53:08,743
What's the distraction?

622
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:10,684
- Well, they want to eat us, right?
- Yeah.

623
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:13,189
Let's give 'em something to eat.

624
00:53:14,492 --> 00:53:16,084
Uh-oh.

625
00:53:17,395 --> 00:53:19,260
Turn on the light.

626
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:32,840
Which one?
The boy or the girl?

627
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:33,899
The girl.

628
00:53:34,879 --> 00:53:36,141
Catch!

629
00:53:36,881 --> 00:53:38,348
Ohh!

630
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,817
Oh, God.

631
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,720
All right.
Body bomb is good to go.

632
00:53:50,795 --> 00:53:53,355
This is simple.
I plug in, and she goes boom.

633
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:56,423
We're goin' to hell.
Right to hell.

634
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,867
This chick is more useful dead
than you are alive. Will you shut up?

635
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:03,532
Yeah, we'll just run this cord
upstairs there

636
00:54:03,608 --> 00:54:06,839
where we been attacked
twice already...

637
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:09,573
then Fucko and I
drop her through a hole

638
00:54:09,647 --> 00:54:11,444
without making a sound,

639
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:14,484
and trick the smartest creatures
I ever seen

640
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:18,352
into taking a bite out of her
instead of us.

641
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,185
That's real simple.

642
00:54:20,258 --> 00:54:24,558
Hey, I already had my moment.
How come I have to go upstairs again?

643
00:54:24,629 --> 00:54:26,529
'Cause you're lucky.

644
00:54:27,999 --> 00:54:29,990
You see these peanut barrels?

645
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:31,625
We line up some planks,

646
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:35,604
when that wall comes down...
we roll 'em out.

647
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:38,932
Just like Donkey Kong.

648
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,705
Dipshit.

649
00:54:44,148 --> 00:54:45,445
I don't believe in guns.

650
00:54:45,516 --> 00:54:48,576
This isn't a time for
a political stance, hot shot.

651
00:54:52,256 --> 00:54:53,814
This won't run out of ammo.

652
00:54:57,428 --> 00:54:59,328
I want this back.

653
00:55:03,234 --> 00:55:04,496
Hey.

654
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,706
Don't monkey with my stereo.

655
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,282
Yeah.

656
00:55:24,755 --> 00:55:24,822
How does it feel?

657
00:55:24,857 --> 00:55:26,653
How does it feel?

658
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:29,625
Uh, okay.

659
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:33,061
Good. Do you mind if I
take a look at it real quick?

660
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:36,531
- No.
- I'll try not to hurt you.

661
00:55:37,868 --> 00:55:39,267
How's it look?

662
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:42,303
- Uh...
- Is it gettin' better?

663
00:55:43,874 --> 00:55:45,603
Maybe.

664
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:47,200
Is it healin' up?

665
00:55:49,847 --> 00:55:53,578
I'm just gonna
swish out my mouth.

666
00:55:53,651 --> 00:55:55,414
Is it gettin' better?

667
00:55:55,486 --> 00:55:58,114
- Yeah, looks pretty good.
- Okay.

668
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,371
You should be a nurse.

669
00:56:23,614 --> 00:56:24,911
Thanks.

670
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:27,075
Can you mend a broken heart?

671
00:56:29,587 --> 00:56:32,681
I wouldn't fuck you for practice.

672
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:36,619
- Tease.
- Asshole.

673
00:56:39,964 --> 00:56:43,263
Ohh... ohh...

674
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:04,077
Bet this place is creepy
in the daytime, too.

675
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:07,919
Pull that chair down.

676
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:37,687
Hyah! Hyah!
Hyah! Hyah!

677
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:41,748
Fuckin' monster.

678
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:42,918
Hyah!

679
00:58:06,484 --> 00:58:08,076
- Up and over.
- Okay.

680
00:58:16,026 --> 00:58:18,756
You and I have
a lot of similarities.

681
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:21,730
Strong, resolute...

682
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,790
You need to be quiet.

683
00:58:23,868 --> 00:58:27,599
I'm sorry.
I talk when I get nervous.

684
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:29,662
Quiet. Come on.

685
00:58:32,776 --> 00:58:35,711
It's just that it's been a while
since someone was horribly killed,

686
00:58:35,779 --> 00:58:40,375
and it seems like the opportune time
for someone to get, I don't know, offed.

687
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:42,818
What did I say?

688
00:58:42,887 --> 00:58:45,617
- Quiet.
- Sorry. I'll stop now.

689
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,992
We're up.

690
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:58,032
Come on, you lazy bastard,
I can't do it all.

691
00:59:40,344 --> 00:59:42,835
Get on up there. Chop-chop.
In you go.

692
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:44,141
Get up there!

693
00:59:58,629 --> 01:00:01,894
Holy shit! She's alive.

694
01:00:01,966 --> 01:00:03,433
Help me.

695
01:00:07,638 --> 01:00:09,868
No, she's not.

696
01:00:12,643 --> 01:00:16,010
Okay, let's do this.

697
01:00:20,451 --> 01:00:22,078
Help me.

698
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:24,416
- No. No!
- Help me.

699
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:28,558
Hey!

700
01:00:34,565 --> 01:00:35,862
Get the cord!

701
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:41,967
Get it, goddamn it!
Come on, grab it, you dumb-ass!

702
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,337
Grab it!
Get the goddamn thing!

703
01:00:45,442 --> 01:00:47,967
Get it! Get the fuckin' thing!

704
01:00:50,781 --> 01:00:54,273
<i>Put the plug in, damnit! Now! Do it!</i>

705
01:00:57,855 --> 01:00:59,117
God almighty!

706
01:01:04,695 --> 01:01:05,889
<i>Come on, man!</i>

707
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:07,890
<i>Now!</i>

708
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,124
Come on! Auggh...

709
01:01:18,609 --> 01:01:20,167
Shit.

710
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:35,183
Great men will write
about my bravery.

711
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:42,354
Hey.

712
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,292
When we get downstairs...

713
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:49,096
...our story's the same, right?

714
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:54,238
Hey.

715
01:01:55,245 --> 01:02:01,081
I can stick this in your mouth,
get all dramatic, and ask again, but...

716
01:02:01,151 --> 01:02:03,176
what about if I just say please?

717
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:06,085
Keep going for the truck!
I'll draw them away!

718
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:08,056
Hey, over here!

719
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:11,924
Fucking monsters!

720
01:02:27,044 --> 01:02:28,807
What the hell are you doing?

721
01:02:28,879 --> 01:02:32,747
I think he's going
for the truck. I couldn't make it!

722
01:02:32,816 --> 01:02:35,717
You gotta help me unlock it!

723
01:02:35,786 --> 01:02:37,879
Stop! Stop!

724
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:40,320
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

725
01:02:40,390 --> 01:02:42,483
They can't get in here!
We agreed!

726
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:44,652
Just calm down.
Just take it easy.

727
01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:46,457
Drop it!
Drop it!

728
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,090
- Okay.
- Drop it!

729
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:51,634
Please let me in. Hurry! They're...

730
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,437
Ohh! Aaahhh!

731
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:08,509
Open the fucking thing!
I'm gonna fucking die!

732
01:03:08,585 --> 01:03:11,486
- You're killing her!
- Put the gun down, son.

733
01:03:11,555 --> 01:03:13,648
Don't let it in!
We'll all die!

734
01:03:13,724 --> 01:03:17,091
They got her.

735
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,650
They got her.

736
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,621
Back off! Get away!

737
01:03:28,105 --> 01:03:32,007
If you could stop trying to
get people killed, that'd be great.

738
01:03:32,075 --> 01:03:33,064
Fuck.

739
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:36,402
You mother<i>fucker!</i>

740
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:39,347
You ain't got a chance
without me, dumb-ass...

741
01:03:59,736 --> 01:04:01,169
Arrgghh!

742
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:28,453
Hold it!

743
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,229
Now we both got a secret,
don't we?

744
01:04:43,647 --> 01:04:44,636
Arrggh!

745
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:45,807
Hey, she's outside.

746
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,509
We've got to get her
out of there. Come on.

747
01:04:47,617 --> 01:04:48,879
- She ain't comin' back.
- What?

748
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:50,944
She's gone.

749
01:04:58,996 --> 01:05:00,293
What happened?

750
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:10,970
They got her, that's all.

751
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:15,304
We tried.

752
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:22,709
That's it.

753
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:26,080
That's the fuckin' end of it.

754
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:28,852
That's the fucking... end of it.

755
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:32,923
Unh!

756
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:36,530
Ohh! Fuck.

757
01:06:14,337 --> 01:06:15,964
Ah, fuck it.

758
01:06:35,525 --> 01:06:37,618
Hey, you guys...

759
01:06:41,865 --> 01:06:43,628
Our plan is... is... is good,

760
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:46,191
and... and that truck is coming.

761
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,896
If we all just stick together, we...

762
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:51,398
Hey!

763
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:55,371
If anyone has a right to have
a complete meltdown right now,

764
01:06:55,445 --> 01:06:56,571
it's me.

765
01:06:56,646 --> 01:06:58,079
But right now,
I don't have the time,

766
01:06:58,148 --> 01:06:59,638
because right now
you morose motherfuckers

767
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,048
are gonna get off your ass
and get ready to roll.

768
01:07:03,253 --> 01:07:04,982
'Cause if those things
are gonna fuck with us...

769
01:07:06,123 --> 01:07:07,715
...we're gonna fuck with 'em right back.

770
01:07:17,334 --> 01:07:18,892
Now, who's with me?

771
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:23,270
Yeah, y'all go ahead
and make a run for it.

772
01:07:23,340 --> 01:07:25,035
Make it happen. Just...

773
01:07:25,108 --> 01:07:28,202
you convoy out of here
and save the day.

774
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:30,940
Me, I'm gonna stay right here,

775
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:32,208
wait for help,

776
01:07:32,282 --> 01:07:35,649
and, uh, limp out of here
to safety.

777
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:41,286
Y'all go ahead, though.

778
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:45,226
Storm out of here,
make a bunch of racket.

779
01:07:45,295 --> 01:07:47,456
They won't even notice me.

780
01:07:49,466 --> 01:07:51,263
They like food that moves.

781
01:07:51,334 --> 01:07:52,426
Aah!

782
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:56,302
On the tables, now!

783
01:07:56,373 --> 01:07:57,806
I'm not getting near it!

784
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:07,613
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

785
01:08:07,684 --> 01:08:09,515
Aaaahhh!

786
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:21,194
Get off him! Get off him!

787
01:08:28,171 --> 01:08:30,469
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

788
01:08:35,178 --> 01:08:37,271
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

789
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:40,111
Calm down! Calm down!

790
01:08:42,085 --> 01:08:45,680
- Calm...
- Stop it...

791
01:08:51,461 --> 01:08:52,553
He didn't make it.

792
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:57,066
- Yes, he did!
- No, he didn't!

793
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,431
Yes, he did!
Yes, he did!

794
01:09:03,873 --> 01:09:06,364
No, he didn't.
No, he <i>didn't!</i>

795
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:08,308
Bullshit!

796
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,637
Aah!

797
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,680
Those goddamn doors
aren't gonna fucking hold!

798
01:09:21,758 --> 01:09:23,020
Plan B?

799
01:09:23,793 --> 01:09:25,283
Here. See this?

800
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,427
I want you to light
this motherfucker and throw it.

801
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:33,128
If we get out of this shit,
I'll personally take you to the hospital.

802
01:09:42,712 --> 01:09:44,043
And don't fuck it up.

803
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:00,952
Oh!

804
01:10:01,031 --> 01:10:02,555
It's over.

805
01:10:02,632 --> 01:10:04,327
We're gonna die.

806
01:10:08,104 --> 01:10:09,537
It's not gonna hold!

807
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:10,766
Comin'!

808
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:19,107
- I can't...
- Look out!

809
01:10:23,987 --> 01:10:25,215
It's stuck!

810
01:10:28,525 --> 01:10:29,924
- I can't...
- Get out of my way!

811
01:10:29,993 --> 01:10:31,824
Okay, now!

812
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,294
Damn you, cocksucker!

813
01:10:41,338 --> 01:10:42,396
Get out of the way!

814
01:10:42,472 --> 01:10:44,872
- Ready?
- Ready? One...

815
01:11:22,846 --> 01:11:24,473
Aah! Aah!

816
01:11:34,224 --> 01:11:35,816
She made it!

817
01:11:35,892 --> 01:11:38,486
- Piece of ass made it!
- Yes.

818
01:11:40,263 --> 01:11:42,163
Come on.

819
01:11:42,232 --> 01:11:45,497
Start it. Start it. <i>Start it!</i>

820
01:11:45,568 --> 01:11:48,469
Come on!

821
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:51,371
Come on. Come on...

01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:58,838
Come on. Drive it like
you stole it, baby! Come on!

823
01:12:11,594 --> 01:12:14,529
She's... she...
she's fucking leaving!

824
01:12:15,432 --> 01:12:16,421
What?!

825
01:12:16,499 --> 01:12:18,091
She's leaving us?

826
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,601
Fuck!

827
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:27,372
Oh, God.

828
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,373
Hey, fuckface!

829
01:13:20,864 --> 01:13:22,024
Whoa, fuck!

830
01:13:54,531 --> 01:13:56,829
No!

831
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:58,492
Oh, shi...

832
01:14:00,670 --> 01:14:02,934
Aah!

Gimme that!

837
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,042
Aah! Aah!

838
01:15:22,118 --> 01:15:25,212
You're having
a fuckin' heart attack?

839
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:27,051
You kidding me?

840
01:15:28,191 --> 01:15:31,285
Get the bottle!
Get the bottle, old man!

841
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:44,800
Aaaahhh!

842
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,432
Drink's on me.

843
01:15:58,621 --> 01:16:00,111
Aaahhh!

844
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:09,891
Good! Choke on it!

845
01:16:14,837 --> 01:16:16,464
Aah!

846
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:24,939
- You got it?
- Yeah.

847
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:25,996
Come on.

848
01:18:27,837 --> 01:18:29,600
Come on, open the door.

849
01:18:45,521 --> 01:18:47,352
You know, her little girl's
not far from here.

850
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:52,121
Wanna get her?

851
01:18:52,195 --> 01:18:54,925
What the fuck
are you talking about?

852
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:56,464
Shut up.

853
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:41,279
Five, four

854
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:44,283
Three, two, run!
