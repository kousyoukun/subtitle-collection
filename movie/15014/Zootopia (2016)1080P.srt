{\an5}瘋狂動物城

{\an5}瘋狂動物城

11
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,820
{\an5}瘋狂動物城

12
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:05,220
恐懼  背叛和嗜血
Fear, treachery, blood lust.

13
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,390
數萬年前支配著我們的世界
Thousands of years ago these were the forces that ruled our world

14
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,560
那時食草動物懼怕食肉動物
A world where prey were scared of predators.

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,120
而食肉動物無法遏制的本能
And predators had an uncontrollable...

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:22,480
讓他們捕獵  殘殺  還有
biological urge to maim, and maul, and...

17
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,620
流血  血  血
Blood! Blood! Blood!

18
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,410
和死亡
And.. Death!

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,600
那時世界分成兩部分
Back then, the world was divided in two.

20
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,260
凶殘的食肉動物  和溫順的食草動物
Vicious predator, or meek prey.

21
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,160
{\an7}凶殘的食肉動物

22
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,160
{\an9}                  溫順的食草動物

23
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:55,790
但我們也隨著時間進化
But over time, we evolved,

24
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:59,300
將這原始野蠻的生活方式拋在身後
and moved beyond or primitive savage ways.

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,370
現在食肉和食草動物和諧共處
Now predator and prey live in harmony.

26
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:08,910
每隻哺乳動物的未來都有了無限可能
And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities.

27
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,250
我不用再縮在羊群裡了
Yeah, I don't have to cower in a a herd anymore.

28
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:13,250
{\an8}英文的黑羊Black Sheep等於中文的害群之馬

29
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,760
我可以做宇航員
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

30
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:22,160
我不用再孤單地追捕狩獵了
I don't have to be a lonely hunter anymore.

31
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,780
我可以追捕逃稅的人
Today I can hunt for tax exemptions.

32
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,490
我要做精算師
I'm gonna be an actuary.

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,450
我可以讓世界更美好  我要做
And I can make the world a better place. I am going to be...

34
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,800
警察
A police officer!

35
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,110
兔子警察  簡直蠢透了
Bunny cop? That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard!

36
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,310
眼界狹窄的當然覺得不可能
It may seem impossible to small minds.

37
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:49,460
說的就是你  吉迪恩·格雷
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

38
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:56,920
但是211英里外就是偉大的動物城
But, just 211 miles away, stands the great city of Zootopia.

39
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:00,350
我們雙方的祖先簽訂和平契約
Where our ancestors first joined together in peace.

{\an8}胡蘿蔔日才藝秀

And declared that anyone can be anything!

42
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:10,390
謝謝大家  晚安
Thank you and good night.

43
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,600
朱迪  你想沒想過
Judy, you ever wonder how

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,130
你媽媽和我為什麼這麼幸福嗎
your mom and me got to be so darn happy?

45
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,740
沒有
Nope.

46
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,980
我們放棄了夢想  安定了下來  對嗎邦妮
Well, we gave up on our dreams, and we settled. Right, Bon?

47
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,440
是啊  斯圖  我們可安定了
Oh, yes. That's right, Stu. We settled hard.

48
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,520
這就是知足常樂  朱迪
You see, that's the beauty of complacency, Jude.

49
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,840
不嘗試新的事物  就絕不會失敗
If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.

50
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,560
我挺喜歡嘗試的
I like trying, actually.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,750
親愛的  你爸爸是說
What your father means, hon,

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,640
成為警官對你來說非常難
is that it's gonna be difficult, impossible even...

53
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,270
甚至是不可能的
for you to become a police officer.

54
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,880
是啊  還從沒有兔子做過警察
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,950
-沒有  -兔子不做警察
- No. - Bunnies don't do that.

56
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,030
-絕不會  -絕不
- Never. - Never.

57
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:41,080
那我就是第一個了
Well... Then I guess I'll have to be the first one.

58
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,560
因為我要讓世界更美好
Because I am gonna make the world a better place!

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,720
或者  這樣
Or, heck, you know.

60
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,810
想讓世界更美好嗎
You wanna talk about making the world a better place,

61
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,900
做個種胡蘿蔔的農民最好了
no better way to do it than becoming a carrot farmer.

62
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:56,160
是啊  你爸爸和我  還有你275個兄弟姐妹
Yes! Your dad, me, your 275 brothers and sisters.

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,240
我們就是在改變世界
We're changing the world.

64
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,240
-一根胡蘿蔔一根胡蘿蔔地拯救  -可不是嘛
- One carrot at a time. - Amen to that.

65
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,660
種胡蘿蔔是光榮的職業
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

66
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,510
只要把種子
Just pulling their seeds out

67
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,120
撒進土裡
And one with the soil...

68
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,090
懂嗎  有夢想是好事
You get it, honey? I mean, it's great to have dreams.

69
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,090
只要別陷進去就好
Yeah, just as long as you don't believe in them too much.

70
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:14,960
她去哪了
Where the heck'd she go?

71
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,810
把票給我
Give me your tickets right now,

72
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,700
不然揍扁你溫順的小屁股
or I'm gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.

73
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,320
住手  吉迪恩
Cut it out, Gideon!

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
咩咩  你要哭嗎
Baah, baah! What are you gonna do, cry?

75
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:30,200
-聽她的  快住手  -戲服不錯  小廢物
- You heard her. Cut it out. - Nice costume, loser.

76
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,010
你是活在什麼地方
What crazy world are you living in

77
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,600
覺得兔子能當警察嗎
where you think a bunny could be a cop?

78
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
乖乖把票還給他們
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

79
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,020
有種來拿  但是小心點
Come and get them. But watch out.

80
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,100
因為我是狐狸
Cause I'm a fox,

81
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,410
你在那蠢貨舞台劇上野說了
and like you said in your dumb little stage play,

82
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,630
以前食肉動物吃食草動物
us predators used to eat prey.

83
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,280
殺手本能還在我們的DANA裡
And that killer instinct's still in our DANA.

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,730
那個  應該是DNA
Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced DNA.

85
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:51,370
我知道  不用你告訴我  崔維斯
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

86
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,650
我不怕你  吉迪恩
You don't scare me, Gideon.

87
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,130
現在怕了嗎
Scared now?

88
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,490
看那鼻子抽的  她怕了呢
Look at her nose twitch, she is scared.

89
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:01,530
哭吧  小兔兔  哭吧
Cry, little baby bunny! Cry...

90
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:07,400
你就是不肯放棄是吧
Oh, you don't know when to quit, do you?

91
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,380
你給我記住這一刻
I want you to remember this moment

92
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,220
免得你再不安分
the next time you think you will ever be...

93
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,170
忘了自己就是只種胡蘿蔔的蠢兔子
anything more than just a stupid carrot-farming dumb bunny.

94
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,990
-好重啊  -你沒事吧  朱迪
- That looks bad. - Are you okay, Judy?

95
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:34,060
我沒事  給你
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. Here you go.

96
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,790
-你把票拿回來了  -你真棒  朱迪
- Wow, you got our tickets! - You're awesome, Judy.

97
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,230
吉迪恩·格雷真是胡說八道
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talking about!

98
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:44,160
有件事他是說對了
Well, he was right about one thing.

99
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,540
我就是不肯放棄
I don't know when to quit.

100
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:51,830

比如冰原鎮  撒哈拉廣場  熱帶雨林區
Tundratown, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few.

105
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
正式上崗前
You're gonna have to

106
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,360
每個區域都要非常熟悉
master all of them before you hit the streets.

107
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,260
不然呢  就死了

Bellwether, make room, will you? Come on.

135
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:06,940
好了  霍普斯警官  笑一個
Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see those teeth!

136
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,250
霍普斯警官  看這裡
Officer Hopps, look here.

137
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,940
-我們真為你驕傲  朱迪  -也有點擔心
- We're real proud of you, Judy. - Yeah, and scared too.

138
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:18,480
-是啊  -又驕傲又擔心
- Yes. - Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo.

139
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,500
動物城啊  那麼遠  那麼大
I mean, Zootopia. So far away, such a big city.

140
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,110
爸媽  我這輩子都在為這一刻努力
Guys, I've been working for this my whole life.

141
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,810
我們知道  我們是替你高興  也有點害怕
We know. And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified.

142
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,730
除了恐懼  沒什麼好害怕的
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.

143
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:34,100
還有熊  熊也要怕
And also bears. We have bears to fear, too.

144
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,640
-更不用說獅子和狼了  -狼
- Say nothing on lions, and wolves. - Wolves?

145
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,690
-黃鼠狼  -你還和黃鼠狼玩過牌
- Weasels. - You played cribbage with a weasel once?

146
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,920
是啊  他那作弊真是沒底線
Yeah, he cheats like there's no tomorrow.

147
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,570
說真的  食肉動物都一樣
You know what? Pretty much all predators.

148
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,550
-動物城全都是  -斯圖
- And Zootopia is full of them. - Oh, Stu.

149
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,600
狐狸是最差勁的
And foxes are the worst.

150
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,240
你爸爸說的有點道理
Yeah, actually, your father does have a point there.

151
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,260
這是天生的  還記得吉迪恩·格雷嗎
It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey?

152
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:55,910
我才九歲  他是個混蛋  剛好也是隻狐狸
When I was nine. Gideon Grey was a jerk who happens to be a fox.

153
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,780
我認識的兔子裡也有不少混蛋呢
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

154
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,970
是啊  可不是  可是以防萬一
Sure, yeah, we all do, absolutely. But just in case,

155
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,090
我們給你弄了個愛心包
we made you a little care package to take with you.

156
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,430
-放了點點心  -這是震狐器
- I put some snacks in there. - This is fox deterrent.

157
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,430
-拿著挺放心的  -驅狐噴霧
- Yeah, it's safe to have that. - This is fox repellant.

158
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,070
又震懾又驅趕  夠了
The deterrent and the repellant, that's all she needs.

159
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,350
-看看這個  -天哪
- Check this out! - Oh, for goodness sake!

160
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:13,210
不用帶電狐器吧  斯圖
She has no need for a fox taser, Stu.

161
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,660
得了吧  電狐器總能用得上
Oh, come on. When is there not a need for a fox taser?

162
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,580
好了  好吧  我帶著這個  好讓你們消停
Well, okay, look, I will take this... To make you stop talking.

163
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,280
太棒了  大家都開心
Terrific! Everyone wins!

164
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:23,370
進站列車  終點動物城
Arriving, Zootopia Express.

165
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,880
好了  得走了  再見
Okay, gotta go. Bye!

166
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,390

00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:39,440
愛你
Love you, too.

168
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,650
天哪  要哭鼻子了
Oh, cripes, here come the waterworks.

169
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,580
斯圖  振作點
Oh, Stu. Pull it together.

170
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,950
大家再見

171
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,570

173
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:05,180
{\an8}正駛離兔窩鎮
人口

174
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,400
{\an8}夏奇羚

175
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,070
{\an8}動物城

176
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:44,840

歡迎來到穿山甲公寓
And welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

178
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,070
魅力四射的豪華公寓
Luxury apartments with charm.

179
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:55,130
每月一次免費除虱  鑰匙別丟了
Complementary delousing once a month. Don't lose your key!

180
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,100
謝謝
Thank you.

181
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:59,920
-你們好  我是朱迪  新鄰居  -我們聲音可大了
- Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbour! - Yeah? Well, we're loud.

182
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,920
也不會道歉的
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

183
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,000
油油的牆
Greasy walls.

184
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,000
晃晃的床
Rickety bed.

185
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,450
瘋癲的鄰居
Crazy neighbors.

186
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,600
我喜歡
I love it!

187
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:38,150
別這樣  他先露的牙
Come on! He bared his teeth first!

188
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,330
你好
Excuse me!

189
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,100

Down here!

190
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:46,790
-你好  -我的天哪

還真找了隻兔子啊
They really did hire a bunny.

192
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,440
天哪  說實話
Ho-whop! I gotta tell you,

193
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,540
你比我想的還要可愛
you're even cuter than I thought you'd be.

194
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,730
你可能不知道
Ooh, ah, you probably didn't know,

195
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,340
兔子可以互相說可愛
but a bunny can call another bunny "Cute",

196
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,420
但是換了其他動物  就有點...
but when other animals do it, that's a little...

197
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,990
真抱歉  我  本傑明·爪豪斯
I am so sorry! Me, Benjamin Clawhauser.

198
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:06,990
大家都以為我
The guy everyone thinks is

199
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,430
只是愛吃甜甜圈的軟萌警察  還給你套刻板印象
just a flabby donut-loving cop, stereotyping you.

200
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,770
沒事的
No, it's okay.

201
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,480
你那裡有個  那個
You've actually got... there's a...

202
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,760
-什麼  -脖子裡  領子上面
- A what? - In your neck. The fold.

203
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:20,690
-那個  -你在這啊  小壞蛋
- The... this... - Oh, there you went, you little dickens!

204
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,630
我得去點名了  哪邊...
Hehehe, I should get to roll call, so which way do I...

205
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:27,800
-候補區在那邊左側  -謝謝
- Oh, bull pen's over there to the left. - Great. Thank you!

206
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:31,230
這小兔子會被生吞活剝的
That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive.

207
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,220
我是霍普斯警官  準備好讓世界更美好了嗎
Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place?

208
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,950
全體都有
Attention!

209
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,440
好了  好了  都坐下
All right. All right. Everybody sit.

210
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:04,120
我這裡有三件事
I've got three items on the docket.

211
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,840
首先來說屋子裡的大象

有些新人我得介紹一下
There are some new recruits with us I should introduce,

216
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:23,440
我就不介紹了  因為  我不在乎
but I'm not going to because... I don't care.

217
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:29,170
最後  有14起哺乳動物失蹤案
Finally, we have 14 missing mammal cases.

218
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:33,800
全是食肉動物  從大北極熊到小水獺
All predators. From a giant polar bear to a teensy little otter.

219
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,570
市政廳天天追在我屁股後面
And City Hall is right up my tail to find them.

220
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:42,110
這是頭等大事  任務分配

沒忘  就是不在乎
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

234
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,980
長官  我可不是只吉祥物
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

235
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,570
那一天開100張停車罰單應該沒問題
Well then, writing a hundred tickets a day should be easy.

236
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,880
100張  我才不開100張呢
100 tickets. I'm not gonna write 100 tickets.

237
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,790
我要開200張  中午之前

241
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,430
看著點路  狐狸
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

242
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,660
他去哪了
Where'd he go?

243
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,730
我不知道你大白天的
Listen. I know what you're doing

244
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,130
出來晃悠什麼呢
skulking around during daylight hours,

245
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,670
但我不想惹麻煩  快走吧

I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir...

247

我真是
I'm such a...

250
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,080

-聽我說  -怎麼了
- Listen, buddy. - What?

252
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:10,460
你那邊沒有給狐狸開的冰淇淋店嗎
There aren't any fox ice cream joints in your part of town?

253
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:14,330
有啊  有  只是我兒子
No, no. There are, there are. It's just, my boy,

254
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:16,790
這隻小傻狐狸  特別迷大象
this goofy little stinker, he loves all things elephant.

255
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:19,040
長大了也想當大象
He wants to be one when he grows up.

256
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:20,900
多可愛啊
Isn't that adorable?

257
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,170
我怎麼忍心讓他夢想破滅呢
Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh? Right?

258
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,640
你是不識字嗎  狐狸  看這個
Look, you probably can't read, fox, but the sign says

259
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,010
我們有權拒絕提供服務

你好  不好意思
Hello. Excuse me.

263
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:41,540
你也和其他人一樣
Hey, you're gonna have to

264
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:44,190
得排隊等著  交通協管
wait your turn like everyone else, meter maid.

265
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:46,420
其實我是警員
Actually, I'm an officer.

266
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,930
就問一下
Just have a quick question.

267
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:50,060
你的顧客們知道
Are your customers aware they're getting

268
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,600
吃的餅乾和冰淇淋裡有鼻涕嗎
snot and mucus with their cookies and cream?

269
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,420
你說什麼呢
What are you talking about?

270
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,630
我不想惹麻煩
Well. I don't wanna cause you any trouble,

271
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,490
但是不戴鼻套盛冰淇淋
but I believe scooping ice cream with

272
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,760
是嚴重違反健康條例的
an ungloved trunk is a class 3 health code violation.

273
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,380
這也不是小事了
Which is kind of a big deal.

274
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:07,270
當然  如果你肯戴上
Of course I could let you off

275
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,430
我是可以給你個警告了事
with a warning if you were to glove those trunks

276
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:12,820
而且  還得給這位
and... I don't know... finish selling this...

277
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,700
爸爸和他兒子  賣一根  什麼
nice dad and his son a... What was it?

278
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,070
大冰棒  拜託了
A Jumbo-Pop. Please.

279
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,390
大冰棒
A Jumbo-Pop.

280
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,410
-15塊  -非常感謝  謝謝你
- $15. - Thank you so much. Thank you.

281
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,820
不會吧
Oh no, are you kidding me...

282
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,780
忘帶錢包了
I don't have my wallet!

283
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,600
真是就差忘帶腦袋了
I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck.

284
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,610
真是啊  天哪  不好意思
That's the truth. Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.

285
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,530
大概是你最糟的生日了
Gotta be about the worst birthday ever.

286
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:43,340
別生我的氣  謝謝你
Please don't be mad at me. Thanks anyway.

287
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,620
不用找了
Keep the change.

288
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,580
警官  真是感恩戴德
Officer, I can't thank you enough.

289
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,170
太好了  怎麼回報你啊
So kind. Really. Can I pay you back?

290
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,790
不用  我請了
Oh, no. My treat.

291
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,870
主要是聽到別人
It's just, you know it burns me up

292
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:02,670
對狐狸有偏見我就受不了
to see folks with such backward attitudes towards foxes.

293
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,550
我只是想說
I just want to say you're

294
00:21:03,550 --> 00:21:08,320
你是位好父親  口才真棒
a great dad and just a real articulate fella.

295
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,680
真是過獎了
Well, that is high praise.

296
00:21:10,690 --> 00:21:13,610
我也很少遇到不看低我的人
It's rare that I find someone so non-patronizing.

297
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,850
-警官你叫  -霍普斯  你是
- Officer? - Hopps. Mr..?

298
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:17,690
王爾德  尼克·王爾德
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

299
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:21,900
你呢  小傢伙  長大了想做大象嗎
And you, little guy. You wanna be an elephant when you grow up?

300
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,840
那就去做大象好了  這是動物城
You be an elephant. Because this is Zootopia.

301
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,270
誰都能成就無限可能
Anyone can be anything.

302
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:30,910
我總這麼跟他說
I tell him that all the time.

303
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,770
好了  給你  雙爪抱住
All right, here you go. Two paws.

304
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,260
看這笑臉  生日快樂真開心
Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile!

305
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,940
好了  嘟嘟兩聲道個別吧
All right, give her a little bye-bye toot-toot.

306
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,320
-再見了  -再見
- Bye, now! - Goodbye!

307
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,290
小大象
Hey, little toot-toot...

308
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:51,750
{\an8}鼠曼兄弟銀行

309
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:52,030
爪子冰棍
Pawpsicles.

310
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,090
來吃爪子冰棍
Get your Pawpsicles.

311
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,750
{\an8}爪子冰棍

312
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:20,600
-木材送到了  -怎麼這個顏色
- Lumber delivery. - What's with the color?

313
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,230
顏色  這是紅木
The color? Uh... it's redwood.

314
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:28,490
39, 40, there you go.

315
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,670
裝小孩真厲害  大傢伙
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

316
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,280
不跟爸爸吻別嗎
No kiss bye-bye for daddy?

317
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,900
再敢親我  我把你臉咬下來
You kiss me tomorrow, I'll bite your face off!

318
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,610
再見
Ciao.

319
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:47,360
我為你出頭  你卻騙了我
Well, I stood up for you, and you lied to me.

320
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,680
騙子
You liar!

321
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,610
這叫智取  親愛的
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart.

322
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,100
我可不是騙子  他才是
And I'm not the liar. He is.

323
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,270
好了  狡猾的尼克  你被捕了
All right, Slick-Nick. You're under arrest.

324
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,690
真的嗎  為什麼
Really? For what?

325
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,340
我也不清楚  無證經營食品嗎
Gee, I don't know. How about selling food without a permit?

326
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,620
跨區運輸未申報商品
Transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines?

327
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,550
-虛假廣告  -許可證  商品申報憑證
- False advertizing. - Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

328
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:13,120
我沒做虛假廣告  再會
And I didn't falsely advertize anything. Take care.

329
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,500
你跟老鼠說冰棒棍是紅木的
You told that mouse the Pawpsicle sticks were redwood!

330
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,170
是啊  紅色的木頭  簡稱就是
That's right. Red wood. With a space in the middle.

331
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,500
紅木
Wood that is red.

332
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,620
你動不了我的  蘿蔔頭
You can't touch me, Carrots.

333
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,580
我從小就開始這麼幹了
I've been doing this since I was born.

334
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,850
不許再叫我蘿蔔頭
You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots.

335
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,850
我的錯  我只是覺得你
My bad. I just naturally assumed you came...

336
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:29,980
肯定是從遍地胡蘿蔔的屯裡來的吧
from some little carrot-choked Podunk. No?

337
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,930
不不
Uh, no.

338
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:33,700
鹿溪才是屯  我在兔窩鎮長大
Podunk is in Deerbrooke county and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

339
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,930
來聽聽這個故事你熟不熟
Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar.

340
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,860
天真的小山妞成績好  有理想
Naive little hick with good grades and big ideas

341
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,690
就覺得  我得去動物城
decides "Hey, look at me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

342
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:46,100
食肉和食草動物和平相處  還一起唱山歌
where predators and prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!"

343
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,370
結果呢  哎呀  他們關係並不好
Only to find, whoopsie, we don't all get along.

344
00:24:49,370 --> 00:24:51,530
做大城市警察的夢想
And that dream of becoming a big city cop,

345
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,480
哎呀呀  成了交通協管
double whoopsie, she's a meter maid.

346
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,220
還有哎呀呀呀
And whoopsie number three-sie,

347
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,530
沒人關心她和她的夢想
no one cares about her or her dreams.

348
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,250
夢想很快就破滅了
And soon enough those dreams die,

349
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,570
然後身體和精神都消沉下去
and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor

350
00:25:01,570 --> 00:25:03,100
只能住在橋洞裡
living in a box under a bridge.

351
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,730
終於發現自己只能選擇回家
Till finally she has no choice but to go back home

352
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:06,750
夾著自己那條
with that cute fuzzy wuzzy

353
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:09,030
毛茸茸的小尾巴  變成了
little tail between her legs to become...

354
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:11,000
你是兔窩鎮的  對吧
You're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?

355
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,780
種胡蘿蔔的農民
So how about a carrot farmer?

356
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,450
聽著不錯吧
That sound about right?

357
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:21,210
小心點  不然就不止是你的夢想被碾碎了
Be careful now, or it won't just be your dreams getting crushed.

358
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:25,530
沒人能告訴我做什麼不做什麼
No one tells me what I can or can't be.

359
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:28,900
尤其是個沒膽量的混球
Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to

360
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,310
只知道智取爪子冰棍
try to be anything more than a Pawpsicle hustler.

361
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,270
好了
All right, look.

362
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,550
大家來到動物城
Everyone comes to Zootopia

363
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,940
覺得能成就無限可能
thinking they can be anything they want.

364
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,270
其實不行  你只能成為自己
Well, you can't. You can only be what you are.

365
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:44,270
狐狸狡猾  兔子蠢
Sly fox. Dumb bunny.

366
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,730
我不蠢
I'm not a dumb bunny.

367
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,920
好吧  這也不是濕水泥
Right. And that's not wet cement.

368
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,010
你做不了真正的警察的
You'll never be a real cop.

369
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,730
做交通協管倒是挺不錯
You're a cute meter maid, though.

370
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:59,050
沒準能做督察員呢  加油
Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there.

371
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,580
{\an8}爸爸媽媽

372
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:35,330
{\an8}一人份胡蘿蔔

373
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,360
-爸爸媽媽  -看她  親愛的
- Oh, hey, it's my parents! - Oh, there she is! Hi, Sweetheart!

374
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,820
你好啊  厲害的朱迪
Hey there, Jude the Dude.

375
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,790
第一天做警察怎麼樣
How was your first day on the force?

376
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:03,390
-可棒了  -跟想的一樣嗎
- It was real great! - Yeah? Everything you ever hoped?

377
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:06,080
當然了  還有呢
Absolutely. And more.

378
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,910
大家都可好了  我覺得
Everyone's so nice, and I feel like...

379
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:09,810
自己真的有點成就
I'm really making a difference.

380
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,590
等等  天哪  邦妮
Wait a second. Holy cranks, Bonnie.

381
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,960
-看看  -我的天哪
- Look at that! - Oh, my sweet heaven!

382
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,610
朱迪  你是交通協管嗎
Judy, are you a meter maid?

383
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:18,500
這個  只是暫時的
Oh, this.. No! Oh, no. This is just a temporary thing..

384
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:21,540
-警局最安全的工作  -她不是真警察
- It's the safest job on the force! - She's not a real cop!

385
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,520
-祈禱終於有回音了  -讚美主
- Our prayers have been answered! - Glorious day!

386
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,830
交通協管  交通協管  交通協管
Ho-ho, meter maid, meter maid, meter maid!

387
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,020
-爸爸  爸爸  -交通協管
- Dad! Dad! - Meter maid!

388
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,050
今天很漫長了  我得
You know what, it's been a really long day, I should...

389
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,740
-你休息吧  -好好協管交通去吧
- You get some rest. - Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves.

390
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,190
-再見  -再見
- Bye-bye. - Bye-bye.

391
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:42,900
兔子  快關了那喪氣的歌
Hey, bunny! Turn down that depressing music!

392
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,190
別煩交通協管  沒聽她說話嗎
Leave the meter maid alone, didn't you hear her conversation?

393
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:49,390
-她覺得自己是廢物  -閉嘴
- She feels like a failure! - Oh, shut up!

394
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,940
-你閉嘴  -你閉嘴
- You shut up! - You shut up!

395
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:54,480
-你閉嘴  -明天又是新的一天
- You shut up! - Tomorrow is another day.

396
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,880
是啊  還可能更糟呢

抱歉  長官  這些不是洋蔥
Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions.

你以為市長把你分過來時
Do you think the mayor asked what I wanted...

451
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:45,220
-問過我想要什麼嗎  -可是  長官
- when he assigned you to me? - But, sir...

452

生活不是卡通音樂劇
Life isn't some cartoon musical

453
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:50,570
只要唱唱跳跳的  然後無聊的夢
where you sing a little song, and your insipid dreams...

454

473
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,220

Insubordination! Now. I'm going to open this door,

474
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,660
然後你告訴那水獺
and you're going to tell that Otter

475
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:02,170
你之前是交通協管  有嚴重妄想症
you're a former meter maid with delusion of grandeur,

476
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:04,390
不能接這個案子

有人把交通錐標偷走了嗎
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

518
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,870
不是我幹的
It wasn't me.

519
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,130
蘿蔔頭  你會把寶寶吵醒的

你那十塊錢的爪子冰棒可以等一會再賣
I think your ten dollars worth of Pawpsicles can wait.

523

You sold Mr. Otterton that Pawpsicle, right?

528
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,350
-你認識他嗎  -沒有我不認識的人
- Do you know him? - I know everybody.

529
00:35:29,350 --> 00:35:31,120
而且我還知道某處的一家玩具店
And I also know that somewhere

530
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,730
丟了一個毛絨玩具
there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal,

531
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,880
所以你趕緊回盒子裡待著吧
so why don't you get back to your box?

532
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:38,170
好吧  看來你是敬酒不吃吃罰酒
Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way.

533
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,840
你把我的嬰兒車鎖住了嗎
Did you just boot my stroller?

534
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,650
尼古拉斯·王爾德  你被捕了
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

535
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,810
理由呢  傷害你的感情嗎
For what? Hurting your feelings?

536
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,350
偷稅漏稅
Felony tax evasion.

537
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,700
從你12歲開始  每年365天
Yeah.. 200 dollars a day, 365 days a year,

538
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,470
每天200塊
since you were 12...

539
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,980
一共是20年  所以乘以20
that's two decades, so times twenty,

540
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:57,890
也就是146萬  應該沒錯吧
which is 1,460,000, I think.

541
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,910
雖然我只是只蠢兔子
I mean, I am just a dumb bunny,

542
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,450
不過我們很會算數[繁殖]
but we are good at multiplying.

543
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,060
總而言之  在你的稅務報表上
Anyway, according to your tax forms,

544
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:06,380
你申報了  讓我看看  零元的稅
you reported, let me see here, zero!

545
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,780
倒霉的是
Unfortunately,

546
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,710
稅收表格上作假是重罪
lying on a federal form is a punishable offense.

547
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:15,050
-要判刑5年  -空口無憑
- 5 years jail time. - Well, it's my word against yours.

548
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,480
小傢伙  從我12歲起
200 bucks a day, fluff,

549
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,600
每年365天  每天200塊
365 days a year, since I was twelve.

550
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,440
其實呢  我都錄下來了
Actually it's your word against yours.

551
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,130
如果你想要這支筆  你就得幫我找到
And if you want this pen you're going to help me

552
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,370
這只失蹤的水獺  不然的話
find this poor missing otter, or the only place

553
00:36:26,370 --> 00:36:29,580
你就只能在監獄的食堂裡賣冰棒了
you'll be selling Pawpsicles is the prison cafeteria.

554
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:32,720
這叫智取  親愛的
It's called a hustle, sweet heart.

555
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:35,080
她把你給耍了
She hustled you.

556
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,390
好個智取
She hustled you good!

557
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,360
你現在是警察了  尼克
You're a cop now, Nick.

558
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,180
給你張貼紙  你會用得上的
You're gonna need one of these.

559
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,620
祝你和小毛球合作愉快
Have fun working with the fuzz!

560
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,660
開始交代吧
Start talking.

561
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:56,410
我不知道他在哪  我只看到他往哪去了
I don't know where he is, I only saw where he went.

562
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,460
棒極了  走吧
Great, let's go!

563
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:02,280
那地方可不適合可愛的小兔兔
It's not exactly a place for a cute little bunny.

564
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:06,630
-不許說我可愛  上車  -好吧  你說了算
- Don't call me cute, get in the car. - Okay. You're the boss.

565
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,750
你好
Hi. Hello?

566
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:31,100
我是  你好
I'm... Hello?

567
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,570
你好  你好
Hello? Hello?

568
00:37:36,330 --> 00:37:37,870
你好  我是
Hello! My name is...

569
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,040
我現在就得打斷你
You know, I'm gonna hit the pause button right there.

570
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,840
因為我們不需要兔子童子軍曲奇餅了
Cause we're all good on bunny scout cookies.

571
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,770
不
Uh, no.

572
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:48,290
我是動物城警局的霍普斯警官
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

573
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:50,150
我在尋找一隻失蹤的哺乳動物
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

574
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,340
艾米特·水獺頓  就是這位
Emmitt Otterton. Right here.

575
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,460
他曾經是這裡的常客
He may have frequented this establishment?

576
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:01,330
沒錯  老艾米特
Yeah, old Emmitt!

577
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,550
好幾周沒見到他了
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

578
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:08,030
但是  你應該找他的瑜伽教練談談
But hey, you should talk to his yoga instructor.

579
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:09,630
我很樂意帶你們到後面去
I'd be happy to take you back.

580
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:10,550
非常感謝
Oh, thank you so much,

581
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:12,730
真是非常非常感謝你  這真是
I'd appericiate that more than you can imagine, it'd be such...

582
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,500
你沒穿衣服
Oh! You are naked..

583
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,560
當然  我們這裡是自然主義俱樂部
Oh, for sure. We're a naturalist club!

584
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:21,020
沒錯  在動物城誰都能成就無限可能
Yeah. In Zootopia anyone can be anything.

585
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,500
這些人  他們就喜歡光著
These guys, they be naked.

586
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,170
南吉就在歡樂池的另一邊
Nangi's just on the other side of the Pleasure Pool.

587
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:37,230
天啊  這裡讓你覺得彆扭嗎
Oh boy. Does this make you uncomfortable?

588
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:40,530
因為你要是覺得彆扭的話  現在放棄還不丟人
Because if so, there's no shame in calling it quits.

589
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,720
很丟人
Yes, there is.

590
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,670
這才像話
Boy, that's the spirit.

591
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:49,400
沒錯  有些哺乳動物認為自然主義很奇怪
Yeah, some mammals say the naturalist life is weird.

592
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,670
可你知道什麼才是奇怪嗎
But you know what I say is weird?

593
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,540
動物穿衣服才奇怪呢  找到她了
Clothes on animals! Here we go!

594
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,120
你們也看到了  南吉是頭大象
As you can see, Nangi is an elephant,

595
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,850
所以她一定會記得所有細節
so she'll totally remember everything.

596
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,180
南吉
Hey, Nangi.

597
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:05,800
他們要問你幾個水獺艾米特的問題
These dudes have some questions about Emmitt the otter.

598
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,700
誰
Who?

599
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,210
艾米特·水獺頓
Emmitt Otterton.

600
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:11,310
他上你的瑜伽課上了六年了
Been coming to your yoga class for like six years.

601
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,970
我不記得這只河狸
I have no memory of this beaver.

602
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:14,740
其實他是只水獺
He's an otter, actually.

603
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:17,110
他幾周前的週三來過  記得嗎
He was here a couple of Wednesdays ago. Remember?

604
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,620
不記得
No.

605
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:21,160
他穿了一件綠色的針織毛衣背心
Yeah, he was wearing a green cable knit sweater vest,

606
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:23,900
還有一條新買的誇特衛寬鬆褲
and a new pair of Quarterway slacks.

607
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,100
還繫了條佩斯利花紋領帶  漂亮的溫莎結
Oh, and a Paisley tie, sweet Windsor knot.

608
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,030
-可帥了  記得嗎  南吉  -不記得
- Real tight. Remember that, Nangi? - No.

609
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:31,620
沒錯  咱們倆一塊送他出去的
Yeah, and we both walked him out,

610
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:35,300
然後他上了一輛銀邊的白色舊車
and he got into this big old white car with a silver trim.

611
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,620
那車該送修了
Needed a tune up.

612
00:39:36,630 --> 00:39:39,680
第三個汽缸都不打火了  記得嗎  南吉
The third cylinder wasn't firing. Remember that, Nangi?

613
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,610
不記得
No.

614
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,740
你不會恰好記得車牌號碼吧
You didn't happen to catch the licence plate number?

615
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,650
-記得嗎  -當然
- Did you? - Oh, for sure.

616
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:51,580
車牌是29THD03
It was 2-9-T-H-D-0-3.

617
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,150
03  你提供了很多有用的信息  謝謝
0-3. Wow, this is a lot of great info. Thank you.

618
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,730
我就說南吉的記憶力好的很嘛
Told you Nangi has a mind like a steel trap.

619
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,690
真希望我也能有大象這麼好的記憶力
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

620
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:03,660
{\an8}迷泉綠洲

621
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:06,520
我玩的很開心  你就不用謝我了
Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue.

622
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,460
既然傻瓜都能查到車牌號碼
And seeing as any moron can run a plate,

623
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,810
那麼我就拿上筆跟你道別了
I will take that pen and bid you adieu.

624
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,210
車牌號  我查不了車牌號
The plate. I can't run a plate.

625
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,200
我還進不了電腦系統
I'm not in the system yet.

626
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,970
-請把筆給我  -你剛才說什麼
- Give me the pen, please. - What was it you said?

627
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:22,190
傻瓜都能查車牌號
Any moron can run a plate?

628
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,020
要是這裡有個傻瓜
Gosh, if only there were a moron around

629
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,600
能幹這件事就好了
who were up to the task.

630
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,300
兔子  我已經照你說的做了
Rabbit, I did what you asked.

631
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:30,220
你不能永遠抓著我不放
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

632
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,340
不會永遠的
Not forever.

633
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:34,560
我只剩36個小時來破案了
Well, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case.

634
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,010
你到底能不能查車牌號
So can you run the plate or not?

635
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:43,150
我剛想起來  我有個朋友在車管所工作
Actually, I just remembered, I have a pal at the DMV.

636
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:45,250
{\an8}車管所

637
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,280
閃電是這裡最快的人
Flash is the fastest guy in there.

638
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,870
你要辦事  找他就對了
You need something done, he's on it.

639
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,390
希望如此
I hope so.

640
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:50,750
我們的時間真的很緊  每一分鐘都很重要
We are really fighting the clock and every minute counts.

641
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,500
等等  他們全都是樹獺嗎
Wait. They're all sloths?

642
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,730
你說會很快的
You said this was going to be quick!

643
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:26,260
怎麼  就因為他是樹獺
What, are you saying just because he's a sloth

644
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,020
他就快不起來嗎
he can't be fast?

645
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:30,500
不是誰都能成就無限可能嗎
I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything.

646
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,510
閃電  閃電  數你最快
Flash, Flash, Hundred Yard Dash!

647
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:33,950
哥們  見到你真高興
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

648
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:41,320
我也  很高興  見到你
Nice to... see you... too.

649
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,630
閃電  給你介紹一下我的朋友
Hey, Flash, I'd love you to meet my friend.

650
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:45,810
親愛的  我忘了你叫什麼名字了
Ah... Darlin, I've forgotten your name.

651
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,770
我是朱迪·霍普斯警官  你好嗎
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD. How are you?

652
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:50,540
我
I am...

653
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,870
過得
doing... just..

654
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,720
-挺好  -還  不錯
- Fine? - As well..as..I can..be...

655
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,180
-有什麼  -堅持住
- What... - Hang in there.

656
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,520
-可以  -我希望你可以幫我查一個車牌
- can I...do... - Well, I was hoping you could run a plate...

657
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,930
-幫你  -我希望你可以
- for you... - Well, I was hoping you could...

658
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:08,910
的嗎
...today?

659
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:14,330

670
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:11,280
駱駝為什麼會有三個駝峰
What do you call a three-humped camel?

671
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:18,560
我不知道  駱駝為什麼

Can we please just focus on the task?

676
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:45,730
等等  等等
Wait, wait!

677
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:48,590

00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,900
我敢說你沒有搜索令吧
And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in, hmm?

695
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,830
-該死  真是掃興  -你故意把耽誤了我一天
- Darn it. It's a bummer. - You wasted the day on purpose.

696
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:43,880
女士  我戴著假警徽
Ma'am, I have a fake badge.

697
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,190
我絕不會妨礙你假裝調查的
I would never impede your pretend investigation.

698
00:44:46,190 --> 00:44:48,200
這不是假裝調查
It's not a pretend investigation!

699
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,010
看  看到他了嗎  這只水獺失蹤了
Look, see? See him? This otter is missing.

700
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:54,720
那他們應該派個真警察去找他
Well, then they should have gotten a real cop to find him.

701
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:57,010
你什麼毛病  看到我失敗
What is your problem? Does seeing me fail

702
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,190
能讓你對自己悲哀的生活感覺好些嗎
somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life?

703
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:02,000
是的  當然了
It does, 100 %.

704
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,730
既然你沒有搜索令
Now, since you're sans warrant.

705
00:45:05,730 --> 00:45:07,910
那咱們兩清了吧
I guess we're done?

706
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,370
好吧  兩清了  給你筆
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

707
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:20,720
首先  你丟東西的動作真像兔子
First off, you throw like a bunny.

708
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,870
其次  你真是個輸不起的傢伙
Second, you're a very sore loser.

709
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,840
回頭見了  毛茸茸警官  可惜都結束了
See you later, Officer Fluff. So sad this is over.

710
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:27,460
真希望能多幫上你點忙
I wish I could have helped more.

711
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,820
問題是
The thing is,

712
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:30,980
有正經的理由  就不需要搜查令
you don't need a warrant if you have probable cause,

713
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,320
我非常確定我見到了
and I'm pretty sure I saw a...

714
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:35,160
一隻賊眉鼠眼的傢伙翻過了柵欄
shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

715
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,560
所以你還真幫了不少忙  走吧
So you're helping plenty! Come on!

716
00:45:39,620 --> 00:45:42,820
29THD03  就是這輛了
2-9-T-H-D-0-3! This is it!

717
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,810
北極熊毛
Polar bear fur.

718
00:45:55,840 --> 00:45:57,440
-天啊  -什麼  怎麼了
- Oh my God! - What? What?

719
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,370
傑裡·沃爾的《絲絨煙斗》
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole!

720
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,070
但是是CD  現在誰還聽CD啊
But on CD. Who still uses CDs?

721
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,980
蘿蔔頭  如果水獺在這待過  他肯定非常難受
Carrots, if your otter was here, he had a very bad day.

722
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,100
那些是爪痕
Those are claw marks.

723
00:46:18,940 --> 00:46:20,840
你見過這樣的情況嗎
You ever seen anything like this?

724
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:23,140
-沒有  -等下  看
- No. - Oh, wait. Look!

725
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,710
是他  艾米特·水獺頓  他肯定來過這兒
This is him. Emmitt Otterton. He was definitely here.

726
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:32,370
你覺得出了什麼事
What do you think happened?

727
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,850
不好  等一下  北極熊毛
Oh no, wait a minute. Polar bear fur...

728
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,720
鼠幫音樂  高檔杯子
Rat-pack music. Fancy cup.

729
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:43,150
我知道這是誰的車了  趕快走
I know whose car this is, we gotta go!

730
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,320
什麼  是誰的車
What? Whose car is it?

731
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,040
冰原鎮裡最可怕的黑幫老大
The most feared crime boss in Tundratown.

732
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,630
他叫大先生
They call him Mr. Big,

733
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,030
他不喜歡我  所以我們快走吧
and he does not like me. So we gotta go!

734
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:51,850
我不走  這是犯罪現場
I'm not leaving, this is a crime scene.

735
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,290
要是大先生發現我在這兒
Well, it's gonna be an even bigger crime scene...

736
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:54,280
就會變成更慘烈的犯罪現場
if Mr. Big finds me here,

737
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:55,930
馬上走
so we're leaving right now.

738
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:01,420
雷蒙德  那是凱文吧  好久不見
Raymond! And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.

739
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:05,900
提到"不見"  你們就當沒見過我行嗎
And speaking of no see, how about you forget you saw me?

740
00:47:06,190 --> 00:47:07,440
看在往日的情面上
For old times sake?

741
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:08,690
不行
That's a no.

742
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:25,110
你做了什麼  讓大先生這麼生氣
What did you do that made Mr. Big so mad at you?

743
00:47:25,110 --> 00:47:28,840
可能是因為我曾經賣給他一塊昂貴的壁毯
I, uh... I may have sold him a very expensive wall rug

744
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:34,850
它是用臭鼬屁股上的毛做的
that was made from the fur of a skunk's butt.

745
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,540
我的天啊
Oh, sweet cheese 'n crackers.

746
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:55,030
-那是大先生嗎  -不
- Is that Mr. Big? - No.

747
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:58,430
-那他呢  是他嗎  -不是
- What about him? Is that him? - No.

748
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:02,630
-這回肯定是他  -別說了
- That's gotta be him. - Stop talking.

749
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,220
別說了  別說了
Stop talking. Stop talking!

750
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:16,580
大先生  這只是一次單純的誤會
Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder...

751
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:17,950
好
Yeah.

752
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,550
這只是一次單純的誤會而已
This is a simple misunderstanding.

753
00:48:23,620 --> 00:48:24,880
我女兒結婚這天
You come here unannounced

754
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,800
你不請自來
on the day my daughter is to be married.

755
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,610
其實  我們是被人強行帶到這兒的  所以...
Well, actually, we were brought here against our will, so...

756
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:33,540
關鍵是  我之前不知道那是您的車
Point is, I did not know that it was your car,

757
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,980
我也不知道您女兒要結婚
and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding!

758
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,200
我信任過你  尼克
I trusted you, Nicky.

759
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,400
我邀請你來我家
I welcomed you into my home.

760
00:48:41,430 --> 00:48:43,060
我們還共進晚餐
We broke bread together.

761
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,700
奶奶給你做了奶油煎餅卷
Grandmama made you a cannoli.

762
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,380
結果你怎麼報答我的好意的
And how did you repay my generosity?

763
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:52,510
拿一塊臭鼬屁股毛做的毯子報答我
With a rug made from the butt of a skunk.

764
00:48:52,700 --> 00:48:54,350
臭鼬屁股毛皮做的毯子
A skunk-butt rug.

765
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:56,320
你不尊重我
You disrespected me.

766
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:58,560
你不尊重我奶奶
You disrespected my grandmama,

767
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,470
我用那塊臭鼬屁股毛皮毯子埋葬了她
who I buried in that skunk-butt rug.

768
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,160
我告訴過你  不准再到這兒來了
I told you never to show your face here again,

769
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,470
但你還是來了
but here you are.

770
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:08,370
賊眉鼠眼地  跟這個
Snooping around with this...

771
00:49:09,190 --> 00:49:12,130
你是幹什麼的  演員嗎  穿成那樣幹什麼
What are you? A performer? What's with the costume?

772
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:14,190
-先生  我是警... -啞劇演員
- Sir, I am a co... - Mime!

773
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:17,330
她是啞劇演員  啞劇演員不能說話
She's a mime. This mime can not speak.

774
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:19,790
-你是啞劇演員  你不能說話  -不  我是警察
- You can't speak if you're a mime. - No, I am a cop.

775
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,630
我在查艾米特·水獺頓案
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

776
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:24,250
線索指向了你的車
And my evidence puts him in your car!

777
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:26,010
隨便你怎麼威脅我
So intimidate me all you want,

778
00:49:26,010 --> 00:49:28,100
就算這是我這輩子做的最後一件事
I'm going to find out what you did to that otter

779
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,660
我也要查出你把水獺怎麼樣了
if it's the last thing I do.

780
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,350
那我就只剩一個請求了
Then I have only one request.

781
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:38,430
幫我跟奶奶問好
Say hello to Grandmama.

782
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,360
做了他們
Ice 'em!

783
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:42,620
不不不  我什麼也沒看見  我絕不說出去
No, no, no. I didn't see nothing! I'm not saying nothing!

784
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:43,580
你也不會說出去了
And you never will.

785
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,710
求求你  別別別
Please! No, no, no, no!

786
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:48,050
你要是因為毯子生我的氣  我還有更多毯子
If you're mad at me about the rug, I've got more rugs!

787
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,190
爸爸  我們該跳舞了
Daddy! It's time for our dance!

788
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:57,330
我們不是說好了嗎  婚禮上不能做掉誰
What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding!

789
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,260
我不得不這麼做  寶貝  爸爸也無奈
I have to, baby, daddy has to.

790
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:01,970
-做掉他們  -不不不
- Ice 'em. - No, no, no!

791
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:03,570
等下  等下
Wait, wait!

792
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,520
她就是昨天從巨型甜甜圈下
She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday!

793
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,410
救了我一命的兔子
From that giant donut!

794
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:11,250
-這隻兔子嗎  -對  你好
- This bunny? - Yeah. Hi!

795
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:15,400
-你好  我喜歡你的裙子  -謝謝
- Hi. I love your dress. - Thank you.

796
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,210
放下他們
Put them down.

797
00:50:20,410 --> 00:50:22,280
你幫了我大忙
You've done me a great service.

798
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,390
我會幫你找到水獺
I will help you find the otter.

799
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,800
我感謝你的善良  我要報答你
I will take your kindness, and pay it forward.

800
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:02,020
水獺頓是我的花匠  他就像家人一樣
Otterton is my florist. He's like a part of the family.

801
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:05,440
他說有要事想商量
He had something important he wanted to discuss.

802
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,450
所以我派那輛車去接他
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.

803
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,810
但他沒能到這兒來
But he never arrived.

804
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:12,910
因為他受到了襲擊
Because he was attacked.

805
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,790
不  是他襲擊別人
No, he attacked.

806
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:17,150
水獺頓嗎
Otterton?

807
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:18,270
就是水獺頓
Otterton.

808
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,920
他發瘋了  在車裡鬧了個底朝天
He went crazy. Ripped up the car.

809
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,560
把我的司機嚇得半死
Scared my driver half to death.

810
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:26,870
然後消失在夜色中
And disappeared into the night.

811
00:51:27,410 --> 00:51:29,700
可他是一隻可愛的水獺
But he's a sweet little otter.

812
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,590
孩子  就算我們進化了
My child, we may be evolved,

813
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,270
內心深處也還是動物
but deep down we are still animals.

814
00:51:39,550 --> 00:51:43,650
你想找到水獺頓  就去跟司機談談
You wanna find Otterton, talk to the driver of the car.

815
00:51:43,650 --> 00:51:47,850
他叫曼查斯  住在熱帶雨林區
His name is Manchas. Lives in the Rainforest District.

816
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:50,200
只有他能告訴你更多消息
Only he can tell you more.

817
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,920
曼查斯先生
Mr. Manchas?

818
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,270
我是警局的朱迪·霍普斯
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

819
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,730
我們想知道艾米特·水獺頓遭遇了什麼
We just wanna know what happened to Emmitt Otterton.

820
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:11,970
你應該問我遭遇了什麼
You should be asking what happened to me.

821
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:17,370
-這是一隻小水獺干的  -發生什麼了
- A teensy otter did that? - What happened?

822
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:19,600
他獸性大發
He was an animal.

823
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:24,110
四爪並用
Down on all fours.

824
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,130
他就是隻野獸
He was a savage!

825
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,860
毫無預兆
There was no warning.

826
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,880
他一直喊著午夜嚎叫
He just kept yelling about the Night Howlers.

827
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:47,000
一遍又一遍地喊午夜嚎叫
Over and over, the Night Howlers!

828
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,610
你也知道午夜嚎叫
So you know about the Night Howlers too?

829
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,370
很好  因為我們來這兒
Good, good. Because the Night Howlers are exactly

830
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:57,610
就是想跟你談談午夜嚎叫  是不是
what we are here to talk about. Right?

831
00:52:57,610 --> 00:53:02,410
對  麻煩你開門  告訴我們你知道什麼
Yep, so you just open the door and tell us what you know,

832
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,440
我們也把我們知道的告訴你
and we will tell you what we know.

833
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,510
好不好
Okay?

834
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:07,920
好吧
Okay.

835
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:11,290
聰明的狐狸
Clever fox.

836
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:17,830
曼查斯先生
Mr. Manchas?

837
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,410
你沒事吧
Are you okay?

838
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,620
跑  快跑
Run. Run!

839
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,040
-他怎麼了  -我不知道
- What is wrong with him?! - I don't know!

840
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:43,130
跳
Jump!

841
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:46,800
快跑
Come on!

842
00:53:51,850 --> 00:53:52,760
低頭
Head down!

843
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,490
霍普斯警官呼叫
Officer Hopps to dispatch!

844
00:53:56,490 --> 00:53:57,560
你知道夏奇羚嗎
Are you familiar with Gazelle?

845
00:53:57,560 --> 00:53:59,740
我們時代最偉大的歌手  長角的天使
Greatest singer of our lifetime. Angel with horns.

846
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,660
接著看  繼續看
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.

847
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:03,000
看她旁邊那是誰  是誰
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

848
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,300
你跳得真棒  本傑明·爪豪斯
Wow,You are one hot dancer, Benjamin Clawhauser.

849
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,810
是我  你覺得像真的嗎  看起來好真
It's me! Did you think it was real? It looks so real!

850
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:13,530
其實不是  只是個新應用而已
It's not, it's just a new app.

851
00:54:13,530 --> 00:54:15,940
-等一下  -爪豪斯
- Hold on a second. - Clawhauser!

852
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:16,940
爪豪斯  聽我說
Clawhauser, listen to me.

853
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:19,820
有危險  美洲豹獸性大發
We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage!

854
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,830
-籐蔓和圖軍加街口  -是圖洪加
- Vine and Tujunga!  - It's Tuhunga!

855
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,040
好的  我們馬上派後援
Okay, we're sending backup!

856
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,530
霍普斯  霍普斯
Hopps, Hopps!

857
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,690
看  那邊  往纜車那兒跑
Look, over there! Head for the sky-trams!

858
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:42,910
進去  蘿蔔頭  蘿蔔頭
Get in. Carrots? Carrots!

859
00:54:42,910 --> 00:54:43,890
快跑
Go!

860
00:54:47,340 --> 00:54:50,900
哥們  咱食肉動物說句心裡話
Buddy, one predator to another.

861
00:54:54,850 --> 00:54:56,500
我能看出你有點緊張
Now I can tell you're a little tense,

862
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,120
我就先給你留點私人空間
so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space!

863
00:55:05,190 --> 00:55:07,890
兔子  不管你幹什麼  都別鬆手
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!

864
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:10,130
-我要鬆手了  -你要幹什麼
- I'm gonna let go! - You're gonna to what?

865
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,400
一  二
One, two...

866
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,710
兔子
Rabbit!

867
00:55:19,330 --> 00:55:21,970
蘿蔔頭  你救了我的命
Carrots, you saved my life.

868
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:25,130
我們警局就是幹這個的
Well, that's what we do at the ZPD...

869
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:44,650
這下可好
Well, this should be good.

870
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,610
我以為只是一起哺乳動物失蹤案
I thought this was just a missing mammal case,

871
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:48,890
可其實要複雜得多
but it's way bigger.

872
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,520
水獺頓先生不僅僅是失蹤了
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

873
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:54,380
我認為他和這只美洲豹  他們
I believe he and this jaguar, they...

874
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:55,770
他們獸性大發了  長官
They went savage, sir.

875
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:58,520
獸性大發  這不是石器時代了  霍普斯
Savage? This isn't the stone age, Hopps.

876
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:00,480
動物們不會獸性大發
Animals don't go savage.

877
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,110
我之前也這麼想
I thought so too.

878
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,950
但我看到了這個
Till I saw this.

879
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:06,920
什麼
What?

880
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,710
他明明就在這兒
He was right here!

881
00:56:08,710 --> 00:56:10,600
野蠻的美洲豹
The savage jaguar?

882
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:13,360
長官  我知道自己看到了什麼  他差點殺了我們
Sir, I know what I saw. He almost killed us!

883
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,420
或者在兔子眼裡
Or maybe any aggressive predator

884
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:18,920
肉食動物有攻擊性就算獸性大發
looks savage to rabbits?

885
00:56:19,260 --> 00:56:20,210
走吧
Let's go!

886
00:56:20,220 --> 00:56:21,160
等等  長官
Wait! Sir!

887
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:22,950
不只有我看見了他
I'm not the only one who saw him.

888
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:23,990
尼克
Nick.

889
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:27,390
你覺得我會相信一隻狐狸
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

890
00:56:27,390 --> 00:56:28,970
他是關鍵目擊證人  我...
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

891
00:56:28,970 --> 00:56:33,320
兩天時間找到水獺  不然你就辭職
Two days to find the otter, or you quit.

892
00:56:33,450 --> 00:56:35,190
我們說好的
That was the deal.

893
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,280
警徽
Badge.

894
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,830
-但是長官  我們  -警徽
- But, sir, we had... - Badge!

895
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,280
不行
Uh, no.

896
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,020
你說什麼  狐狸
What did you say, fox?

897
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:57,450
抱歉  我說"不行"
Sorry, what I said was "No...".

898
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,910
她不必給你警徽
She will not be giving you that badge.

899
00:57:00,370 --> 00:57:04,590
你給她一件小丑背心和一輛可笑的三輪車
Look, you gave her a clown vest, and a three-wheeled joke-mobile,

900
00:57:04,590 --> 00:57:05,810
給她兩天時間
and two days to solve a case

901
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,390
讓她破你們兩周都沒破的案子
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

902
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:11,320
難怪她會找狐狸幫忙
Yeah, it's no wonder she needed to get help from a fox.

903
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:13,660
因為你們誰也不打算幫她  是不是
None of you guys were gonna help her, were you?

904
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:15,050
這樣  老大
Here's the thing, chief.

905
00:57:15,050 --> 00:57:18,720
你給她48小時  所以嚴格來說我們還剩下
You gave her the 48 hours, so technically we still have...

906
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:21,020
10小時找到水獺頓先生
ten left to find our Mr. Otterton.

907
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,820
而且我們肯定會找到他的
And that's exactly what we're gonna do.

908
00:57:22,820 --> 00:57:24,340
失陪了
So if you'll excuse us,

909
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,140
我們要追查重大線索  還有案子要破
we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack.

910
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:29,420
再見
Good day.

911
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,110
霍普斯警官
Officer Hopps.

912
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:00,320
謝謝
Thank you.

913
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:04,250
別讓他們知道自己能影響到你
Never let them see that they get to you.

914
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,670
這麼說...
So...

915
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:09,410
有人影響過你
Things do get to you?

916
00:58:10,020 --> 00:58:11,310
現在不會了
I mean not, not anymore.

917
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:15,140
但我曾像你一樣弱小
But I was small and emotionally unbalanced

918
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,330
情緒失控
like you once.

919
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,640
-是嗎  -不  真的
- Har har. - No, it's true.

920
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:22,870
我當時大概八九歲
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

921
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,940
我一心想
And all I wanted to do

922
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:28,240
加入童子軍
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

923
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,850
所以我媽媽設法湊夠了錢
So my mom scaped together enough money

924
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,210
給我買了一身嶄新的制服
to buy me a brand new uniform.

925
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,270
因為我一定要融入進去
Because, by god, I was gonna fit in.

926
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:39,420
{\an8}動物城  少年童子軍

927
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:40,580
哪怕我是隊裡唯一的食肉動物  唯一一隻狐狸
Even if I was the only predator in the troop, the only fox.

928
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:41,390
尼克
Hey, Nick.

929
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,410
我要成為童子軍中的一員
I was gonna be part of a pack.

930
00:58:43,410 --> 00:58:47,220
-準備好加入了嗎  -當然  生來就準備好了
- Ready for initiation? - Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

931
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:49,070
我太驕傲了
I was so proud.

932
00:58:51,790 --> 00:58:55,580
舉起你的右爪  宣讀誓言
Okay. Now raise your right paw, and deliver the oath.

933
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,860
我  尼古拉斯·王爾德  在此起誓
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave,

934
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:02,720
我將勇敢忠誠  熱心可靠
loyal, helpful and trustworthy.

935
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:05,580
即使你是隻狐狸嗎
Even though you're a fox?

936
00:59:06,630 --> 00:59:07,690
什麼
What?

937
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:12,160
不  我做錯什麼了  各位
No, no! What did I do wrong, you guys?

938
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:16,350
拜託  我做錯了什麼了  我幹什麼了
No, please! What did I do wrong? What did I do?

939
00:59:17,610 --> 00:59:20,900
你以為我們會相信一隻不戴口套的狐狸
If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle?

940
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:23,120
你比你外表的樣子還蠢
You're even dumber than you look.

941
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:27,440
他是要哭了嗎
Is he gonna cry?

942
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:45,310
那天我學到了兩件事
I learned two things that day.

943
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,850
我絕不讓別人知道他們影響到了我
One,I was never gonna let anyone see that they got to me.

944
00:59:52,350 --> 00:59:54,000
還有一個呢
And two?

945
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,440
如果整個世界
If the world's only gonna

946
00:59:56,440 --> 01:00:00,050
都覺得狐狸奸詐狡猾
see a fox as shifty and untrustworthy...

947
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:02,830
那我也沒必要變成別的樣子了
There's no point in trying to be anything else.

948
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:07,330
尼克  你不是這樣的人
Nick, you are so much more than that.

949
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:12,840
天哪  瞧瞧下面堵成什麼樣了
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

950
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:15,180
問問交通局的查克怎麼樣
How about we go up to Chuck in traffic central?

951
01:00:15,180 --> 01:00:17,470
查克  道路監控顯示情況如何
Chuck, how are things looking on the jam cams?

952
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:19,540
尼克  我很高興你告訴了我
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

953
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,340
道路監控
The jam cams...

954
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:25,270
-真的  你不用岔開話題的  -不不不
- Seriously, it's okay. - No, no no!

955
01:00:25,270 --> 01:00:29,870
整個天篷到處都是道路監控攝像頭
There are traffic cameras everywhere. All over the canopy!

956
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:31,760
不管那只豹子去了哪
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

957
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,110
道路監控都應該拍得到
The traffic cameras would have caught it!

958
01:00:33,110 --> 01:00:36,530
-棒  -哈哈  很狡猾哎  小狐狸
- Bingo! - Ho-ho! Pretty sneaky, slick!

959
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,510
但是  你之前都沒法查車牌
However, if you didn't have access to the system before,

960
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:43,310
恐怕現在牛脾氣局長也不會給你查
I doubt chief Buffalo Butt is gonna let you into it now.

961
01:00:43,310 --> 01:00:47,590
確實  但我市政廳的有個朋友也許可以
No. But I have a friend at City Hall who might.

962
01:00:48,870 --> 01:00:51,910
先生  能請您看一下這些重要的賬單嗎
Sir, if we could just review these very important billings.

963
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:54,150
先生  抱歉  先生
Sir! Oh, I'm sorry. Sir.

964
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,000
好了  我聽到了  頭羊
Okay! I heard you, Bellwether,

965
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,920
你處理就行了
just take care of it!

966
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:00,510
謝謝  取消我下午的事  我要出去
Please. And clear my afternoon, I'm going out.

967
01:01:00,510 --> 01:01:01,120
但是  先生
Oh, no, no.

968
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,810
你還約了動物評級公司呢  先生  有點
But, sir, you do have a meeting with Herds and Gradings. Sir, that's just, oh...

969
01:01:06,670 --> 01:01:08,400
我要死了
Oh, mutton chops.

970
01:01:10,040 --> 01:01:13,080
頭羊市長助理  我們需要你的幫助
Assistant Mayor Bellwether, we need your help.

971
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,950
{\an8}市長助理辦公室
Office of the assistant mayor

972
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:17,120
我們只想看看道路監控錄像
we just need to get into the traffic cam database.

973
01:01:25,450 --> 01:01:27,410
毛茸茸的呢
So fluffy!

974
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:29,410
綿羊從來不讓我靠這麼近的
Sheep never let me get this close!

975
01:01:29,410 --> 01:01:31,090
你不能隨便摸人家的毛
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

976
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:32,990
-像棉花糖一樣  -住手
- It's like cotton candy. - Stop it!

977
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:34,240
哪裡的
Where to?

978
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:37,460
雨林區  籐蔓和圖洪加街口
Rainforest Dsitrict. Vine and Tujunga.

979
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,440
就是那  全市的道路監控
There. Traffic cams for the whole city.

980
01:01:37,840 --> 01:01:40,340
{\an8}動物城交通網絡

981
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,210
這其實蠻刺激的
This is so exiting actually. I mean, well, you know.

982
01:01:42,210 --> 01:01:44,080
我還從來沒幹過這麼重要的事呢
I never get to do anything this important.

983
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:46,650
但你可是動物城的市長助理啊
But you're the assistant mayor of Zootopia.

984
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,020
其實就是個名頭響亮點的秘書而已
I'm more of a glorified secretary.

985
01:01:49,120 --> 01:01:51,730
我覺得獅心市長只是為了拉來綿羊的選票
I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote.

986
01:01:51,730 --> 01:01:53,580
但他給了我那個漂亮的咖啡杯呢
But he did give me that nice mug.

987
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:55,200
{\an8}世界最棒的市長助理(爸爸)

988
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:57,170
被表揚的感覺還是很好的
Feels good to be appreciated.

989
01:01:57,170 --> 01:01:58,580
臭羊
Smellwether!

990
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:01,440
就是他給我起的一個有趣外號
That's a fun little name he likes to use.

991
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,860
我叫過他一次獅屁  他一點都不開心
I called him Lionfart once, he did not care for that.

992
01:02:04,860 --> 01:02:06,190
跟你說  那天我可倒了大霉
Let me tell you, it was not a good day for me.

993
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,560
-是  先生  -我不是說要取消下午的事嗎
- Yes, sir. - I thought you were gonna cancel my afternoon.

994
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,120
天哪  我得走了  找到什麼告訴我
Oh, dear. I better go. Let me know what you find.

995
01:02:12,120 --> 01:02:14,610
真的很感謝你們能
It was really nice for me to be...

996
01:02:14,610 --> 01:02:16,680
韶華易逝  臭羊
While we're young, Smellwether.

997
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:20,690
你覺得她睡覺的時候會數自己嗎
You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself?

998
01:02:20,690 --> 01:02:22,820
閉嘴  好的  道路監控
Shush. Okay, traffic cams..

999
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:34,240
{\an8}動物城交通網絡

1000
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:24,430
圖洪加  圖洪加
Tujunga.... Tujunga....

1001
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:25,650
找到了
We're in.

1002
01:02:31,490 --> 01:02:35,890
-他們是誰呀  -森林狼
- Who are these guys? - Timberwolves.

1003
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:38,070
瞧瞧這些白癡
Look at these dum-dums.

1004
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:44,160
賭一毛錢他們要嚎叫了
Bet you a nickel one of them's gonna howl.

1005
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:45,630
你看吧
And there it is.

1006
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:49,090
你就說狼為什麼非要嚎叫呢
I mean, what is it with wolves and the howling, it's...?

1007
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,050
狼嚎  午夜嚎叫
Howlings! Night Howlers!

1008
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:52,590
曼查斯怕的就是這個
That's what Manchas was afraid of,

1009
01:02:52,590 --> 01:02:55,120
狼群  午夜嚎叫指的就是狼群
wolves! The wolves are the Night Howlers!

1010
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:56,070
如果曼查斯是他們帶走的
If they took Manchas...

1011
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:57,940
帶走水獺頓的也是他們
I bet they took Otterton too.

1012
01:02:58,100 --> 01:02:59,910
只要找到他們去了哪就可以了
All we gotta do is find out where they went.

1013
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:04,640
{\an8}冰原鎮

1014
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:07,740
{\an8}熱帶雨林區

1015
01:03:07,650 --> 01:03:08,720
等等  他們去哪了
Wait, where'd they go?

1016
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:09,160
要是我
You know,

1017
01:03:09,160 --> 01:03:12,800
干了違法的事要躲監控攝像頭
if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal,

1018
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:16,010
當然我沒幹過這種事  我會走6B通道
which I never have, I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

1019
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,250
{\an8}維修通道

1020
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,150
也就是說他們在  這裡
Which would put them out... right there.

1021
01:03:19,880 --> 01:03:22,930
瞧瞧你  小偵探
Well, look at you, junior detective.

1022
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:27,920
我覺得你當警察肯定很厲害
You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop.

1023
01:03:28,140 --> 01:03:29,290
你好大膽子
How dare you.

1026
01:03:33,890 --> 01:03:35,440
他們是要出城
They're heading out of town.

1027
01:03:35,540 --> 01:03:37,180
哪條路通往哪裡
Where does that road go?

1028
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:41,950
{\an8}崖邊精神病院

1029
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:23,960
加裡  別叫  你要引得大家都叫起來了
Gary, quit it! You're gonna start a howl!

1030
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,330
不是我先叫的
I didn't start it.

1031
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:33,850
快走
Come on.

1032
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:44,460
你真是只聰明的小兔子
You are a clever bunny.

1033
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,780
看來這兒曾經是所醫院
It looks like this was a hospital.

1034
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:18,340
還是你先請  你是警察嘛
You know, after you, you're the cop.

1035
01:05:26,790 --> 01:05:28,350
好的  安全
Okay, all clear.

1036

01:05:42,590 --> 01:05:46,060
好大好大的爪痕  是什麼
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks. What kind of...

1040
01:06:04,810 --> 01:06:06,340
曼查斯先生
Mr. Manchas.

1041
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,740
是他  找到水獺了
It's him! We found our otter.

1042
01:06:20,420 --> 01:06:23,830
水獺頓先生  我是朱迪·霍普斯警官
Mr. Otterton, my name is Officer Judy Hopps.

1043
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:25,630
是你妻子讓我來找你的
Your wife sent me to find you.

1044
01:06:25,630 --> 01:06:27,450
我們現在就救你出去
We're gonna get you out of here now.

1045
01:06:28,460 --> 01:06:29,640
還是別出來了
Or not.

1046
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,600
他好像不是很著急回家見老婆
Guess he's in no rush to get home to the missus.

1047
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,950
11, 12, 13, 14.

1048
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:38,380

Not including Manchas, it's... it's fourteen.

1049
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:41,210
牛局長分配了14個失蹤動物案件
Chief Bogo handed out 14 missing mammal files.

1050
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:42,750
他們都在這兒
They're all here...

1051
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:46,070
所有失蹤動物都在這兒

1052
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,750
夠了
Enough!

1053
01:06:52,750 --> 01:06:55,460
我不要借口  醫生  我要的是答案
I don't want excuses, doctor, I want answers.

1054
01:06:55,460 --> 01:06:58,760
獅心市長  拜託  我們已經盡力了
Mayor Lionheart, please. We're doing everything we can.

1055
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,830
是嗎
Really?

1056
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:01,860
因為我面前
Cause I got a dozen and a half animals here

1057
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,540
堆著一群瘋得沒形的動物
who've gone off the rails crazy,

1058
01:07:03,540 --> 01:07:05,560
而你連原因都不知道
and you can't tell me why.

1059
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,240
我覺得這離盡力還差得遠了點
Now I'd call that awfully far from doing everything!

1060
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:11,620
先生  也許該從生物學角度考慮一下了
Sir, it may be time to consider their biology.

1061
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:13,590
什麼  什麼叫從生物學角度考慮
What? What do you mean "Biology"?

1062
01:07:13,590 --> 01:07:16,420
只有食肉動物才會變獸性大發
The only animals going savage are predators.

1063
01:07:16,430 --> 01:07:19,810
紙包不住火  我們必須告訴大家
We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward.

1064
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,300
好主意  告訴民眾
Hm, great idea. Tell the public.

1065
01:07:22,300 --> 01:07:23,400
你覺得他們會
And how do you think they're

1066
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:27,570
怎麼想他們的獅子市長
gonna feel about their mayor who is a lion?!

1067
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:30,180
-我就毀了  -那牛局長怎麼說
- I'll be ruined! - Well, what does Chief Bogo say?

1068
01:07:30,180 --> 01:07:32,730
牛警長還不知道
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

1069
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,450
我們也不會讓他知道
And we are going to keep it that way.

1070
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:36,180
{\an8}爸爸媽媽

1071
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:37,220
糟糕
Oh, no!

1072
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:40,300
-有人在這兒  -先生  你得走了  快
- Someone's here. - Sir, you need to go. Now.

1073
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,190
保安  清查本區
Security, sweep the area.

1074
01:07:50,290 --> 01:07:51,410
真好  這下死定了
Great, we're dead.

1075
01:07:51,410 --> 01:07:54,810
死了  結束  我得死你得死  大家都得死
We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead.

1076
01:07:54,810 --> 01:07:56,260
-你會游泳嗎  -什麼
- Can you swim? - What?

1077
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,910
會游泳嗎  我會  所以呢
Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why?

1078
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:22,450
蘿蔔頭  霍普斯  朱迪
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

1079
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,020
我們得告訴牛局長
We gotta tell Bogo!

1080
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:29,900
您的舞跳的真棒  牛局長
Wow, you are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.

1081
01:08:32,990 --> 01:08:34,500
-牛局長  -我在忙
- Chief Bogo! - Not now.

1082
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:36,630
-等等  是夏奇羚的聲音嗎  -不是
- Wait, is that Gazelle? - No!

1083
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:40,020
我是夏奇羚  你的舞跳的真棒
I'm Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer.

1084
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:44,430
你也在玩那個應用嗎  警長
You have the app too? Chief!

1085
01:08:44,430 --> 01:08:45,680
爪豪斯  你沒看到
Clawhauser! Can't you see

1086
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,750
我正在忙失蹤動物案件嗎
I'm working on the missing mammal cases?

1087
01:08:47,900 --> 01:08:49,360
是的  當然  說到那個案子  長官
Yes, of course. About that, sir.

1088
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,660
霍普斯警官來了電話  14個她都找到了
Officer Hopps just called, she found all of them.

1089
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:55,070
好厲害
Wow, I'm impressed.

1090
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:58,730
獅心市長
Mayor Lionheart,

1091
01:08:58,730 --> 01:09:00,350
你有權保持沉默  但你所說的一切
you have the right to remain silent. Anything you...

1092
01:09:00,350 --> 01:09:03,390
你不理解  我是為了保護這個城市
You don't understand, I was trying to protect the city!

1093
01:09:03,390 --> 01:09:05,610
你只想保住你的工作
You were just trying to protect your job.

1094
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:08,930
不  聽著  我們還不知道這是怎麼回事
No, listen. We still don't know why this is happening.

1095
01:09:08,930 --> 01:09:10,890
它會毀了動物城的
It could destroy Zootopia.

1096
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:12,630
你有權保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

1097
01:09:12,630 --> 01:09:13,840
你說的每一句話
Anything you say can and

1098
01:09:13,840 --> 01:09:15,640
都將成為呈堂證供
will be used against you in a court of law.

1099
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:21,820
{\an8}警察局

1100
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:22,670
雌性雄性們
Ladies and gentlemammals,

1101
01:09:22,970 --> 01:09:26,790
失蹤的14名動物現已全數找回
14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found...

1102
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:30,570
找到他們的是下面這位新景觀
by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment.

1103
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:35,020
-我好緊張  -媒體見面快速入門
- I'm so nervous. - Okay, press conference 101.

1104
01:09:35,020 --> 01:09:36,010
你想表現的聰明點
You wanna look smart,

1105
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,710
就要用自己的問題回答他們的問題
answer their question with your own question

1106
01:09:37,710 --> 01:09:39,680
然後再回答自己的問題
and then answer that question.

1107
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:42,460
像這樣  請問  霍普斯警官
Like this, "Excuse me, Officer Hopps.

1108
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:44,120
這件案子你有什麼可以透露的
What can you tell us about the case?"

1109
01:09:44,230 --> 01:09:48,310
這案子不簡單嗎  確實是  懂了嗎
"Well, was this a tough case? Yes, yes it was. You see?"

1110
01:09:48,310 --> 01:09:49,880
你應該跟我一起上台
You should be up there with me.

1111
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:51,610
這是我們一起完成的
We did this together.

1112
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:55,030
我是個警察嗎  不  我不是
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

1113
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:56,990
真巧你說到這了
Funny you should say that.

1114
01:09:57,270 --> 01:09:59,770
因為  我一直在想
Because, well, I've been thinking.

1115
01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:04,340
要是有個搭檔就好了
It would be nice to have a partner.

1116
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,070
給你  如果你需要支筆寫字
Here. In case you need something to write with.

1117
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,830
霍普斯警官  時間到了
Officer Hopps. It's time.

1118
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,150
接下來  有請
So now, I'll turn things over to

1119
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:28,460
解決了本案件的警官
the officer who cracked the case.

1120
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:31,240
朱迪·霍普斯警官
Officer Judy Hopps.

1121
01:10:35,770 --> 01:10:36,590
請講
Yes?

1122
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,480
獸性大發的動物您作何評論
What can you tell us about the animals that went savage?

1123
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:42,610
大家都在疑惑的動物
Well, the animals in question.

1124
01:10:46,240 --> 01:10:50,990
他們都是不同種類的嗎  沒錯
Are they all different species? Yes. Yes, they are.

1125
01:10:51,900 --> 01:10:54,050
好的  那有什麼聯繫呢
Okay, so what is the connection?

1126
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:55,330
我們只知道
All we know is that

1127
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:58,190
他們都是食肉動物
they are all members of the predator family.

1128
01:10:58,190 --> 01:11:01,260
所以獸性大發的只有食肉動物嗎
So predators are the only ones going savage?

1129
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:03,400
沒錯  確實如此  沒錯
That is accu.. Yes, that is accurate, yes.

1130
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:07,170
-為什麼  怎麼會出現這樣的事  -還不知道
- Why? Why is this happening? - We still don't know.

1131
01:11:07,790 --> 01:11:09,210
但是
But, emm.

1132
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:13,130
也許和生物學有關
It may have something to do with biology.

1133
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:14,720
您說生物學是什麼意思
What do you mean, biology?

1134
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:17,080
就是生物構成
A biological component.

1135
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:20,410
在他們的DNA裡
You know, something in their DNA.

1136
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:23,400
他們的DNA  您能詳細說一下嗎
In their DNA, can you elaborate on that, please?

1137
01:11:23,400 --> 01:11:27,810
可以  我是說幾千年以前
Yes. What I mean is thousands of years ago

1138
01:11:28,230 --> 01:11:32,490
食肉動物捕獵的本能
Eh, predators survived through their...

1139
01:11:32,620 --> 01:11:35,750
一直存在著
agressive hunting instincts.

1140
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,350
不知為什麼
For whatever reason,

1141
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:41,170
他們好像回歸了原始  野蠻的本性
they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways.

1142
01:11:45,370 --> 01:11:47,790
霍普斯警官  怎麼會出現這樣的事呢
Officer Hopps, could it happen again?

1143
01:11:47,790 --> 01:11:50,890
這是有可能的  所以我們需要警惕
It is possible. So, we must be vigilant.

1144
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,370
警局也做好了萬全準備
And we at the ZPD are prepered

1145
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:54,470
我們會保護好大家
and are here to protect you.

1146
01:11:54,470 --> 01:11:55,880
會有更多動物獸性大發嗎
Will more mammals go savage?

1147
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:57,170
您將採取何種措施保護市民
What is being done to protect us?

1148
01:11:57,170 --> 01:11:59,480
您會考慮強制隔離食肉動物嗎
Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators?

1149
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:01,670
謝謝  霍普斯警官
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

1150
01:12:01,820 --> 01:12:04,620
時間到了  請不要再提問了
That's all the time that we have. No more questions.

1151
01:12:07,200 --> 01:12:09,730
-我表現如何  -講得挺好
- Was I okay? - Oh, you did fine.

1152
01:12:11,570 --> 01:12:13,050
時間太少了  我還沒來得及介紹你
That went so fast, I didn't get a chance to

1153
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:15,060
介紹我們的
mention you or say anything about how we...

1154
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,660
你覺得你說的夠多了
Oh, I think you said plenty.

1155
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:19,120
什麼意思
What do you mean?

1156
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,970
顯然是他們的生物構成
"Clearly there's a biological component?"

1157
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,330
他們好像回歸了原始
"These predators may be reverting

1158
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:27,000
野蠻的本性
back to their primitive, savage ways?"

1159
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:28,870
你開玩笑嗎
Are you serious?

1160
01:12:28,910 --> 01:12:31,460
我只是陳述案件事實
I just stated the facts of the case.

1161
01:12:31,460 --> 01:12:34,000
兔子就不可能突然變野蠻
I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage.

1162
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,110
所以狐狸有這種可能
Right, but a fox could? Huh?

1163
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:38,340
尼克  別這樣  你跟他們不一樣
Nick, stop it, you're not like them.

1164
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:40,690
他們是指誰
Oh, there's a 'them' now?

1165
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:43,470
我意思是  你不是那種食肉動物
You know what I mean, you're not that kind of predator.

1166
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:45,040
要帶上口套的那種嗎
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

1167
01:12:45,050 --> 01:12:46,500
要用防狐噴霧
The kind that makes you think

1168
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,390
對付的那種嗎
you need to carry around fox repellant?

1169
01:12:49,390 --> 01:12:50,180
第一次見面我就發現了
Yeah, don't think I didn't

1170
01:12:50,190 --> 01:12:52,360
你帶著那瓶小東西
notice that little item the first time we met.

1171
01:12:52,830 --> 01:12:56,080
我問你個問題  你害怕我嗎
Look. Let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me?

1172
01:12:58,020 --> 01:12:59,650
你覺得我會發瘋嗎
Do you think I might go nuts?

1173
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,690
我會獸性大發嗎
You think I might go savage?

1174
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:06,580
我會不會吃了你
You think I might try to eat you?

1175
01:13:09,950 --> 01:13:11,630
早料到了
I knew it, huh.

1176
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:15,600
還以為真有人會相信我呢
Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me, huh?

1177
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:19,970
你還是別找食肉動物做搭檔了
Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner.

1178
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,520
{\an8}就職申請

1179
01:13:25,350 --> 01:13:27,880
不  尼克  尼克
No, Nick. Nick!

1180
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:30,230
霍普斯警官  那只食肉動物威脅你了嗎
Officer Hopps, were you just threatened by that predator?

1181
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:31,940
不  他是我朋友
No, he's my friend.

1182
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:34,000
我們連朋友都不能相信了嗎
We can't even trust our own friends?

1183
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,640
我沒這麼說  請讓一讓
That is not what I said. Please.

1184
01:13:35,790 --> 01:13:38,690
-我們安全嗎  -有沒有狐狸獸性大發了
- Are we safe? - Have any other foxes gone savage?

1185
01:13:38,820 --> 01:13:41,500
更多的惡性事件讓全市陷入恐慌
More bad news in this city gripped by fear.

1186
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:55,120

A caribou is in critical condition.

1188
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:46,060
起因是遭獸性大發的北極熊襲擊
The victim of a mauling by a savage polar bear.

1189
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:48,330
這是繼警局的朱迪·霍普斯警官
This, the 27th such attack,

1190
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:50,660
將暴力事件和食肉動物天性關聯後
comes just one week after ZPD Officer,

1191
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:52,160
一周以來發生的
Judy Hopps connected the

1192
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:55,690
第27起同類案件
violence to traditionally predatory animals.

1193
01:13:55,690 --> 01:13:57,020
與此同時  由巨星夏奇羚
Meanwhile, a peace rally

1194
01:13:55,990 --> 01:14:05,800
{\an8}和平集會現場氣氛緊張

1195
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,750
組織的和平集會遭到了強烈抵制
organized by popstar Gazelle was marred by protest.

1196
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:04,640
-滾回森林去  食肉動物  -我是大草原來的
- Go back to the forest, predator! - I am from the savannah.

1197
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,640
動物城是個獨特的地方
Zootopia is a unique place.

1198
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:14,340
{\an8}夏奇羚呼籲和平

1199
01:14:06,930 --> 01:14:10,450
在這個瘋狂  美麗  多樣化的城市
It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city.

1200
01:14:10,530 --> 01:14:12,660
我們為不同而驕傲
Where we celebrate our differences.

1201
01:14:13,080 --> 01:14:15,230
這不是我所熟悉的動物城
This is not the Zootopia I know.

1202
01:14:16,090 --> 01:14:19,000
我熱愛的動物城不應該是這樣
The Zootopia I know is better than this.

1203
01:14:19,330 --> 01:14:21,700
大家不會彼此盲目指責
We don't just blindly assign blame.

1204
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:29,180
雖然不知道攻擊事件持續發生的原因
We don't know why these attacks keep happening.

1205
01:14:29,630 --> 01:14:33,760
但認為所有食肉動物都有獸性是不負責任的
But it's irresponsible to label all predators as savages.

1206
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:42,310
那不是我的艾米特
It's not my Emmitt.

1207
01:14:44,950 --> 01:14:47,510
我們不能讓恐懼分裂彼此
We cannot let fear divide us.

1208
01:14:47,640 --> 01:14:52,010
請把我熱愛的動物城還給我
Please give me back the Zootopia I love.

1209
01:14:55,340 --> 01:14:58,170
來吧  霍普斯  新市長要見我們
Come on, Hopps. The new mayor wants to see us.

1210
01:14:58,180 --> 01:15:00,690
新市長要見我  為什麼
The mayor? Why?

1211
01:15:01,090 --> 01:15:03,250
你終於功成名就了
It would seem you've arrived.

1212
01:15:06,950 --> 01:15:10,260
爪豪斯  你在幹嘛
Clawhauser? What are you doing?

1213
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:15,390
他們說  市民來到警察局
They thought it would be better if a predator

1214
01:15:15,400 --> 01:15:19,040
一進門就看到像我這只食肉動物
such as myself wasn't the first face that you see

1215
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:21,210
似乎不太好
when you walk into the ZPD.

1216
01:15:21,280 --> 01:15:22,610
什麼
What?

1217
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:26,590
他們把我調去檔案室了  在樓下
They're gonna move me to records. It's downstairs.

1218
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,500
鍋爐房隔壁
It's by the boiler.

1219
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:32,090
霍普斯
Hopps!

1220
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:38,160
{\an8}正直  誠實  勇敢

1221
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:40,990
我不太明白
I don't understand.

1222
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:43,510
我們市90%是食草動物  朱迪
Our city is 90 % prey, Judy,

1223
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:46,740
他們現在都嚇壞了
and right now they're just really scared.

1224
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:50,380
你是他們的英雄  他們信任你
You're a hero to them. They trust you.

1225
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:52,240
所以我和牛局長
And so that's why Chief Bogo

1226
01:15:52,240 --> 01:15:57,010
希望你來當警局的新形象代言人
and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD.

1227
01:16:01,500 --> 01:16:06,550
我不是  不是什麼英雄
I'm... not... I'm not a hero.

1228
01:16:07,770 --> 01:16:10,700
我來到這裡是想讓世界更美好  但是
I came here to make the world a better place. But...

1229
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:12,920
我搞砸了
...I think I broke it.

1230
01:16:12,920 --> 01:16:16,330
別太看得起自己  霍普斯
Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps.

1231
01:16:16,730 --> 01:16:20,710
世界一直都是一團糟  所以才需要好警察
The world has always been broken, that's why we need good cops.

1232
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:23,450
正如你
Like you.

1233
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,530
您說的對  長官
With all due respect, sir,

1234
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:33,450
但好警察應該服務於民  保衛家園
a good cop is supposed to serve and protect.

1235
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:38,100
團結人心而不是分裂大家
Help the city. Not tear it apart.

1236
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:45,700
-我配不上警徽  -霍普斯
- I don't deserve this badge. - Hopps.

1237
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,810
朱迪  你付出那麼多努力來到這裡
Judy, you've worked so hard to get here.

1238
01:16:48,930 --> 01:16:51,280
這是你從小的夢想
It's what you've wanted since you were a kid.

1239
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:52,940
別放棄啊
You can't quit.

1240
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:55,220
謝謝你們給我的機會
Thank you for the opportunity.

1241
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,310
{\an8}《動物城時報》  局勢動盪  城市分裂

1242
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,780
一打胡蘿蔔  謝謝光臨
A dozen carrots. Have a nice day.

1243
01:17:17,780 --> 01:17:18,790
走吧
Come on.

1244
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:27,710
朱迪  厲害的朱迪
Hey there, Jude. Jude the Dude.

1245
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:30,410
記得這個小名嗎  你怎麼了
Remember that one? How we doing?

1246
01:17:30,860 --> 01:17:34,200
-我很好  -一點都不好  你耷拉著耳朵呢
- I'm fine. - You are not fine, your ears are droopy.

1247
01:17:35,510 --> 01:17:37,980
我怎麼會妄想自己能改變世界
Why did I think I could make a difference?

1248
01:17:37,980 --> 01:17:39,930
因為你敢於嘗試
Because you're a trier, that's why.

1249
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,620
你從小就愛打破陳規
You've always been a trier.

1250
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:43,350
我的確嘗試過了
Oh, I tried.

1251
01:17:43,390 --> 01:17:47,470
結果讓很多無辜的食肉動物生活更糟糕
And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators.

1252
01:17:47,950 --> 01:17:50,260
也不是全部  說曹操曹操就到  正是時候
not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time.

1253
01:17:50,260 --> 01:17:52,240
{\an8}吉迪恩·格雷糕點店

1254
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:55,860
那是吉迪恩·格雷嗎
Is that Gideon Grey?

1255
01:17:56,030 --> 01:17:58,000
沒錯  就是他  我們一起做生意
Yeah, it sure is. We work with him now.

1256
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,400
他是合作夥伴  要不是你讓我們放下成見
He's our partner. And we never would have considered it,

1257
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,520
-我們也不會和他合作  -說的對
- had you not opened our minds. - That's right.

1258
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:03,760
他現在是三窩區
I mean, kid's turned into one of

1259
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:05,990
最棒的糕點師之一
the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

1260
01:18:07,790 --> 01:18:11,790
真是了不起啊
That's... That's really cool, you guys.

1261
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:15,800
吉迪恩·格雷  真沒想到
Gideon Grey. I'll be darned.

1262
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,520
朱迪
Hey, Judy.

1263
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:18,200
小時候我不懂事
I'd just like to say I'm sorry

1264
01:18:18,200 --> 01:18:20,400
我想向你道歉
for the way I behaved in my youth.

1265
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:23,600
因為不自信  為了證明自己厲害
I had a lot of self-doubt, and it manifested itself

1266
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,270
才到處惹是生非  欺負弱小
in the form of unchecked rage and agression.

1267
01:18:26,270 --> 01:18:28,480
我真是個混蛋
I was a major jerk.

1268
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:32,340
我有時候也有點混蛋
Well, I know a thing or two about being a jerk.

1269
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,120
這些派是給你們的
Anyhow, I brought you all these pies.

1270
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:41,420
當心  孩子們  別踩到午夜嚎叫[拉丁文]
Hey, kids! Don't you run through that midnicampum holicithias.

1271
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,310
霍普斯先生  那名字太高級了
Well, now. There's a four-dollar word, Mr. H.

1272
01:18:44,310 --> 01:18:47,050
我們家的人就叫它午夜嚎叫
My family always just call them Night Howlers.

1273
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:50,120
等等  你剛剛說什麼
I'm sorry. What did you say?

1274
01:18:50,370 --> 01:18:52,110
他是說那些花兒  朱迪
Kid's talking about those flowers, Judy.

1275
01:18:52,110 --> 01:18:53,910
我種了用來驅蟲的
I use them to keep the bugs off the produce,

1276
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:55,500
但不能讓小傢伙們靠近它們
but I don't like the little ones going near them

1277
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:57,080
不然就會像你特裡叔叔那樣
on acoount of what happened to your uncle Terry.

1278
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,050
我們小時候  特裡叔叔吃了一整朵
Yeah, Terry ate one whole when we were kids

1279
01:18:59,050 --> 01:19:00,430
結果就發瘋了
and went completely nuts.

1280
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:02,380
對著你媽媽亂咬一通
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

1281
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:05,630
兔子也會獸性大發
A bunny can go savage.

1282
01:19:05,630 --> 01:19:07,490
獸性  那倒不至於
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.

1283
01:19:07,490 --> 01:19:08,970
可真是疼死我了
But it did hurt like the devil.

1284
01:19:08,970 --> 01:19:09,870
當然疼
sure it did.

1285
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:13,080
你手臂咬了個大洞  要我說就是獸性
There's a sizable divot in your arm. I'd call that savage.

1286
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:16,520
午夜嚎叫不是指狼  是指花兒
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're flowers.

1287
01:19:16,520 --> 01:19:19,450
是花兒讓食肉動物獸性大發的
The flowers are making the predators go savage.

1288
01:19:19,680 --> 01:19:22,510
原來如此  我知道哪裡搞錯了
That's it! That's what I've been missing!

1289
01:19:22,870 --> 01:19:25,200
鑰匙  鑰匙  快給我
keys! Keys! Keys! Keys! Hurry, come on!

1290
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:28,090
謝謝  我愛你們  拜拜
Thank you! I love you, bye!

1291
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:35,360
-你聽懂她在說啥嗎  邦妮  -完全不懂
- You catch any of that, Bon? - Not one bit.

1292
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,050
你們也沒懂我就放心了
That makes me feel a little bit better,

1293
01:19:37,050 --> 01:19:39,390
我以為她在說哪國鳥語呢
I thought she was talking in tongues or something.

1294
01:19:56,540 --> 01:19:57,620
誰啊
Who is it?

1295
01:19:58,090 --> 01:20:00,680
我得找到尼克  求你了
I need to find Nick. Please.

1296
01:20:02,520 --> 01:20:03,800
尼克
Nick?

1297
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,440
尼克
Nick?

1298
01:20:08,690 --> 01:20:09,760
尼克
Nick.

1299
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:13,930
午夜嚎叫不是指狼  是指一種有毒的花
Night Howlers aren't wolves, they're toxic flowers.

1300
01:20:14,060 --> 01:20:15,930
我覺得有人故意陷害食肉動物
I think someone is targetting predators on purpose

1301
01:20:15,930 --> 01:20:17,800
讓他們獸性大發
and making them go savage.

1302
01:20:21,210 --> 01:20:22,730
真有意思啊
Isn't that interesting?

1303
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:28,410
等等  請別...我知道你永遠不會原諒我了
Wait, please don't.. I know you'll never forgive me.

1304
01:20:28,410 --> 01:20:30,060
我能理解
And I don't blame you.

1305
01:20:30,350 --> 01:20:32,220
我也不會原諒我自己
I wouldn't forgive me either.

1306
01:20:33,070 --> 01:20:38,400
我太無知  又不負責任  還心胸狹窄
It was ignorant, and irresponsible, and small-minded.

1307
01:20:39,620 --> 01:20:42,550
但食肉動物不該因為我的過失而受苦
But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes.

1308
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,830
我得彌補自己犯的錯
I have to fix this.

1309
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:47,550
但是沒有你  我辦不成
But I can't do it without you.

1310
01:20:48,730 --> 01:20:52,280
等我們完成這件事
And... And after we're done...

1311
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:55,830
你怎麼恨我
you can hate me. And...

1312
01:20:56,050 --> 01:20:57,770
都沒關係
And that'll be fine.

1313
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:02,600
因為我是個差勁的朋友  又傷害了你
Because I was a horrible friend and I hurt you.

1314
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:08,710
從一開始你就是對的
And you can walk away knowing that you were right. All along.

1315
01:21:09,450 --> 01:21:12,830
我真是只笨兔子
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1316
01:21:17,220 --> 01:21:20,600
我真是只笨兔子
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1317
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,990
我真是只笨兔子
I really am just a dumb bunny.

1319
01:21:32,840 --> 01:21:34,970
好了  過來吧
All right, get in here.

1320
01:21:37,510 --> 01:21:41,480
你們兔子啊  動不動就哭

好了  深呼吸
There we go, deep breath.

1322
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:46,350
你該不是要偷這支筆吧
Are you-Are you just trying to steal the pen?

1323
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:48,020
說中了嗎
Is that what this is?

1324
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:52,000
-你踩到我尾巴了  快挪開  -對不起
- You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off! - I'm sorry.

- What's your plan? - We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

1328
01:22:03,530 --> 01:22:04,890
行  怎麼追
Okay, how?

1329
01:22:04,990 --> 01:22:08,520
-認識他嗎  -跟你說了  我誰都認識
- Know this guy? - I told you, I know everybody.

01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:24,890
瞧瞧  這是誰啊  盜版公爵
look who it is, the Duke of Bootleg.

1340
01:22:24,890 --> 01:22:25,640
你來幹嘛  王爾德
What's it to you, Wilde?

1341
01:22:25,640 --> 01:22:27,890
不用搗鼓爪子冰棒了嗎
Shouldn't you be melting down a Pawpsicle or something?

1342
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,430
這不是兔兔警官嗎
if it isn't flopsy the copsie.

1343
01:22:30,430 --> 01:22:33,720
我們已經知道了  你偷的根本不是洋蔥
We both know those weren't only onions I caught you stealing.

1344
01:22:33,730 --> 01:22:36,070
你要午夜嚎叫幹什麼  猥瑣屯
What were you gonna do with those Night Howlers, Weselton?

1345
01:22:36,070 --> 01:22:40,290
是黃鼠狼  黃鼠狼公爵  我才不告訴你呢  兔子
It's Weaselton, Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit.

1346
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:42,910
你能逼我還是怎麼著
And there ain't nothing you can do to make me.

1347
01:22:44,270 --> 01:22:45,570
做了他
Ice him.

1348
01:22:48,710 --> 01:22:51,160
死耗子  幹嘛幫她  她是警察
You dirty rat, why are you helping her? She's a cop!

1349
01:22:51,160 --> 01:22:54,340
她還是我未來外孫女的教母
And the godmother to my future granddaughter.

1350
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:56,660
我打算叫她朱迪
I'm gonna name her Judy.

1351
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,580
做了這只黃鼠狼
Ice this weasel.

1352
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,780
不要  求你了  我什麼都說
All right, all right! Please! I'll talk. I'll talk.

1353
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,590
我偷午夜嚎叫是要賣掉
I stole the Night Howlers so I could sell them.

1354
01:23:03,590 --> 01:23:06,600
他們開的價我實在沒法拒絕
They offered me what I couldn't refuse: Money.

1355
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:08,750
你把那些花兒賣給誰了
And to whom did you sell them?

1356
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:10,160
一隻叫道格的公羊
A ram named Doug.

1357
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,920
我們在地下有個交易點
We got a drop spot underground.

1358
01:23:11,940 --> 01:23:15,130
一定要小心  道格絕不是善類
Just watch it. Doug is the opposite of friendly.

1359
01:23:12,210 --> 01:23:15,040
{\an8}榕樹街地鐵站

1360
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:17,310
他一點都不友好
He's unfriendly.

1361
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:28,510
趕緊地
Come on.

1362
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,790
黃鼠狼沒有說謊
The weasel wasn't lying.

1363
01:23:43,790 --> 01:23:46,860
道格壟斷了整個午夜嚎叫的市場
Yeah,it looks like old Doug's cornered the market on Night Howlers.

1364
01:24:30,980 --> 01:24:33,610
我是道格  目標是誰
You got Doug here. What's the mark?

1365
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:38,640
撒哈拉廣場的獵豹  知道了
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

1366
01:24:39,100 --> 01:24:41,960
什麼  我知道他們很快  但我能搞定
Serious? Yeah, I know they're fast, I can hit him.

1367
01:24:41,960 --> 01:24:44,050
一隻坐在車裡的小小水獺
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter

1368
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:46,640
我都能穿過車窗打中
through the open window of a moving car.

1369
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:01,610
搞定了我打你電話
Yeah, I'll buzz you when it's done.

1370
01:25:01,610 --> 01:25:03,380
或者你直接看新聞
Or you'll see it on the news.

1371
01:25:03,380 --> 01:25:05,270
看那個更快了
You know, whichever comes first.

1372
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:08,910
道格  開門  拿鐵來了
Hey, Doug, open up! We've got your latte.

1373
01:25:08,910 --> 01:25:10,550
沃爾特和傑西回來了
All right, Woolter and Jesse are back,

1374
01:25:10,550 --> 01:25:12,480
我要掛了
so I'm leaving now. Out.

1375
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:13,150
你要去哪裡
Hey. Wait, where you going?

1376
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,380
你要去哪裡  回來
Where are you going? Get back here!

1377
01:25:14,390 --> 01:25:16,540
你要幹嘛  你會被逮到的
What are you doing? He's gonna see you!

1378
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,770
你在看什麼
What are you looking at? Hey!

1379
01:25:18,770 --> 01:25:20,450
不管你在想什麼  別亂來
Whatever you're thinking, stop thinking it.

1380
01:25:20,450 --> 01:25:23,610
蘿蔔頭  蘿蔔頭
Carrots. Carrots.

1381
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,110
這次讓他多加奶泡了吧
You better have the extra foam this time.

1382
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:29,840
開門
Hey! Open up!

1383
01:25:29,850 --> 01:25:32,480
你要幹嘛  你把我們困在這裡了
What are you doing? You just trapped us in here!

1384
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,600
我們要把這些證據送到警局
We need to get this evidence to the ZPD.

1385
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,800
-裝好了  走吧  -要所有的
- Okay, great. Here it is. Got it. - No, all of it.

1386
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:39,190
什麼
Wait, what?

1387
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,270
你都會開火車了啊
Oh, great, you're a conductor now, huh?

1388
01:25:44,270 --> 01:25:45,090
聽我說
Hey. Listen.

1389
01:25:45,090 --> 01:25:48,350
要啟動這堆廢鐵除非奇跡發生
It would take a miracle to get this rustbucket going.

1390
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:51,570
好吧  哈利路亞
Well. Hallelujah.

1391
01:25:51,570 --> 01:25:56,180
實驗室這裡出了點狀況  是大麻煩
We kinda got a situation at the lab. It just got worse!

1392
01:25:57,510 --> 01:25:58,870
任務完成
Mission accomplished.

1393
01:25:58,870 --> 01:26:01,480
現在嘟嘟鳴笛慶祝會不會有點早
Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot?

1394
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:04,080
好吧  就嘟一下
All right. One toot-toot.

1395
01:26:06,420 --> 01:26:09,320
又一個願望完成了
Well, I can cross that off the bucket list.

1396
01:26:19,680 --> 01:26:21,870
那聲鳴笛還是取消吧
I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot.

1397
01:26:23,970 --> 01:26:25,450
也許只是下冰雹了
Maybe that's just hail.

1398
01:26:29,140 --> 01:26:30,210
走開
Back off!

1399
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:36,540
來了
Incoming!

1400
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:42,030
-蘿蔔頭  -別剎車
- Carrots! - Don't stop! Keep going.

1401
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,420
不  快剎車
No, stop. Please stop!

1402
01:26:43,420 --> 01:26:45,770
絕對不要剎車
Do not stop this car!

1403
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:09,230
加快速度  尼克
Speed up, Nick. Speed up!

1404
01:27:09,240 --> 01:27:10,580
對面有另一輛列車
There's another train coming!

1405
01:27:10,580 --> 01:27:12,600
相信我  加速
Trust me, speed up.

1406
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:17,940
停車
Stop the train!

1407
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:21,640
要幫忙嗎
Hey. Need some help?

1408
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:28,580
天啊  太快了  抓住
Oh, no. Oh, no no no. Too fast! Too fast! Hold on!

1409
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:42,050
我們該下車了
I think this is our stop.

1410
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,440
也許  也許還有證據留下來
Okay, maybe... Maybe some of the evidence survived.

1411
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:06,660
全沒了  我們搞砸了
Everything is gone. We've lost it all.

1412
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:10,710
除了這個
Yeah. All, except for this.

1413
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:13,250
太好了  尼克
Nick! Yes!

1414
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:15,620
走吧  我們趕緊送去警局
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

1415
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:18,290
從自然博物館穿過去
Cut through the Natural History Museum.

1416
01:28:29,990 --> 01:28:33,730
-就在那裡  -朱迪  朱迪
- There it is. - Judy. Judy!

1417
01:28:34,580 --> 01:28:36,140
頭羊市長
Mayor Bellwether.

1418
01:28:36,570 --> 01:28:37,850
我們知道真相了
We found out what's happening.

1419
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:39,950
有人向肉食動物注射血清
Someone's darting predators with a serum.

1420
01:28:39,950 --> 01:28:41,690
所以他們才獸性大發
That's what's making them go savage.

1421
01:28:41,690 --> 01:28:45,070
幹得真棒 朱迪  我真為你驕傲
I'm so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job.

1422
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,470
謝謝市長
Thank you, ma'am.

1423
01:28:50,750 --> 01:28:52,910
你是怎麼找到我們的
How did you know where to find us?

1424
01:28:52,910 --> 01:28:54,570
我要過去拿箱子了
I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now.

1425
01:28:54,570 --> 01:28:59,900
還是我跟尼克送到警局吧
You know what? I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD.

1426
01:29:04,450 --> 01:29:05,520
-跑  -跑
- Run. - Run.

1427
01:29:06,660 --> 01:29:07,970
抓住他們
Get them!

1428
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,140
蘿蔔頭
Carrots!

1429
01:29:16,670 --> 01:29:18,480
我來扶你  趕緊過來
Here, I got you. Get in here.

1430
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,270
先放鬆下
Okay. Now, just relax.

1431
01:29:24,390 --> 01:29:26,670
-吃藍莓嗎  -不用了
- Blueberry? - Pass.

1432
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:30,590
朱迪
Judy.

1433
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,210
把箱子拿給牛局長
Take the case. Get it to Bogo.

1434
01:29:33,210 --> 01:29:35,000
我不會拋下你的
I'm not gonna leave you behind, that's not happening.

1435
01:29:35,010 --> 01:29:37,830
-我走不了  -我們會想到辦法的
- I can't walk. - Just.. We'll think of something.

1436
01:29:37,830 --> 01:29:40,260
我們都是一樣的  朱迪
We're on the same team, Judy.

1437
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:44,550
被人低估  懷才不遇
Underestimated. Underappreciated.

1438
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:46,890
你還沒厭倦這一切嗎
Aren't you sick of it?

1439
01:29:49,480 --> 01:29:53,340
食肉動物就算強壯嗓門大
Predators. They may be strong and loud.

1440
01:29:53,350 --> 01:29:56,740
但如果食草動物是食肉動物的十倍
But prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

1441
01:30:00,950 --> 01:30:01,770
試想一下
Think about it.

1442
01:30:01,770 --> 01:30:07,010
百分之九十的動物聯手對付共同的敵人
90% of the population united against a common enemy.

1443
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:09,140
我們將所向披靡
We'll be unstoppable.

1444
01:30:15,030 --> 01:30:16,100
在那裡
Over there!

1445
01:30:33,040 --> 01:30:35,680
你就該呆在胡蘿蔔農場裡
Well, you should have just stayed on the carrot farm, huh?

1446
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,840
太可惜了  我挺喜歡你的
It really is too bad, I did like you.

1447
01:30:38,840 --> 01:30:41,320
你想幹嘛  殺了我嗎
What are you gonna do? Kill me?

1448
01:30:42,390 --> 01:30:44,200
當然不是了
No, of course not.

1449
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:45,810
是他
He is.

1450
01:30:46,210 --> 01:30:48,610
不  尼克
No! Oh, Nick?

1451
01:30:49,170 --> 01:30:53,850
警官  自然歷史博物館裡有只獸性大發的狐狸
Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the Natural History Museum!

1452
01:30:53,850 --> 01:30:56,890
霍普斯警官已倒下  趕緊過來
Officer Hopps is down. Please hurry!

1453
01:30:57,360 --> 01:30:58,710
尼克  你要反抗
No, Nick. Don't do this. Fight it.

1454
01:30:58,710 --> 01:31:01,840
但他是無法反抗的
Oh, but he can't help it. Can he?

1455
01:31:01,940 --> 01:31:07,010
食肉動物的天生就有獸性
Since predators are just biologically predisposed to be savages.

1456
01:31:17,810 --> 01:31:20,490
想想明天的頭條
Gosh! Think of the headline!

1457
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:24,410
英雄警官被獸性狐狸所殺害
Hero Cop Killed by Savage Fox.

1458
01:31:25,520 --> 01:31:26,540
你的目的就是這個嗎
So that's it?

1459
01:31:26,540 --> 01:31:29,630
食草動物畏懼食肉動物然後你掌權
Prey fears predator, and you stay in power?

1460
01:31:29,630 --> 01:31:31,250
差不多吧
Yeah. Pretty much.

1461
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:32,570
不會得逞的
It won't work.

1462
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:35,130
畏懼總能管用的
Fear always works.

1463
01:31:35,130 --> 01:31:38,510
為了這目的  我會給所有肉食動物都打一針
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1464
01:31:41,610 --> 01:31:43,970
尼克  不
Oh, Nick. No.

1465
01:31:46,940 --> 01:31:48,400
再見了  小兔子
Bye-bye, bunny.

1466
01:31:54,870 --> 01:31:59,000
流血  血  血  和死亡
Blood, blood, blood! And death.

1467
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:00,320
好了好了  強行搶戲嗎
All right, you know you're milking it.

1468
01:32:00,320 --> 01:32:02,230
而且  我覺得我們成功了
Besides, I think we got it. I think we got it.

1469
01:32:02,230 --> 01:32:04,450
我們成功了  謝謝你  叨叨羊
We got it up there, thank you, yakety-yak.

1470
01:32:04,450 --> 01:32:06,420
你全盤招認了
You laid it all out beautifully.

1471
01:32:06,420 --> 01:32:07,100
什麼
What?

1472
01:32:07,100 --> 01:32:09,110
你是在找血清嗎
Yeah. Oh, are... are you looking for the serum?

1473
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:10,350
在這呢
Well, it's right here.

1474
01:32:10,350 --> 01:32:11,840
你武器裡的
What you've got in the weapon there,

1475
01:32:11,930 --> 01:32:14,620
是我家裡農場種的藍莓
those are blueberries, from my family's farm.

1476
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:17,790
可好吃了  你該嘗嘗
They are delicious. You should try some.

1477
01:32:18,290 --> 01:32:21,200
我陷害了獅心  我也可以陷害你
I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too.

1478
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,810
你們空口無憑
It's my word against yours.

1479
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:25,600
其實呢
Actually...

1480
01:32:25,820 --> 01:32:29,180
我會給所有肉食動物都打一針
And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way.

1481
01:32:29,180 --> 01:32:31,060
我都錄下來了
It's your word against yours.

1482
01:32:31,910 --> 01:32:34,860
這叫智取  親愛的
It's called a hustle, Sweetheart. Boom!

1483
01:32:42,170 --> 01:32:44,810
前任市長晨曦·頭羊已入獄
Former mayor, Dawn Bellwether is behind bars today,

1484
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:49,370
{\an8}前市長頭羊入獄

1485
01:32:44,810 --> 01:32:47,120
罪名是策劃了動物城
guilty of masterminding the savage attacks

1486
01:32:47,120 --> 01:32:49,000
食肉動物野蠻襲擊事件
that have plagued Zootopia of late.

1487
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:51,180
她的前任上司  裡奧多·獅心
Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart,

1488
01:32:50,140 --> 01:33:03,540
{\an8}獅心終於發聲

1489
01:32:51,180 --> 01:32:53,010
否認所有與其密謀的指控
denies any knowledge of her plot,

1490
01:32:53,010 --> 01:32:55,600
聲稱只是為了保護動物城
claiming he was just trying to protect the city.

1491
01:32:55,600 --> 01:32:58,040
我囚禁這些動物是錯的嗎
Did I falsely imprison those animals?

1492
01:32:58,120 --> 01:32:59,630
是的  我確實錯了
Well, yes. Yes, I did.

1493
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:00,510
這是經典的
It was a classic

1494
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:03,490
為了正確的目的做了錯事
doing the wrong thing for the right reason kind of a deal.

1495
01:33:03,490 --> 01:33:05,230
另外  醫生宣稱
In related news, doctors say

1496
01:33:04,090 --> 01:33:08,490
{\an8}午夜嚎叫解藥已見成效

1497
01:33:05,230 --> 01:33:07,890
午夜嚎叫的解藥
the Night Howlers' antidote is proving effective

1498
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:10,660
已讓受害食肉動物逐漸恢復
in rehabilitating the afflicted predators.

1499
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:18,050
艾米特
Oh, Emmitt!

1500
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:22,630
謝謝
Thank you.

1501
01:33:25,380 --> 01:33:26,810
我小時候
When I was a kid,

1502
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:31,040
我以為動物城是完美的地方
I thought Zootopia was this perfect place.

1503
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,010
人人和諧相處
Where everyone got along,

1504
01:33:33,310 --> 01:33:35,940
誰都能成就無限可能
and anyone could be anything.

1505
01:33:36,620 --> 01:33:37,850
現在發現
Turns out,

1506
01:33:38,140 --> 01:33:39,990
現實遠比宣傳口號
real life is a little bit more complicated

1507
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:42,300
要複雜
than a slogan on a bumper sticker.

1508
01:33:42,790 --> 01:33:45,030
現實生活是糟糕的
Real life is messy.

1509
01:33:45,990 --> 01:33:48,380
我們都有局限性
We all have limitations.

1510
01:33:48,530 --> 01:33:50,200
都會犯錯
We all make mistakes.

1511
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:54,370
但是樂觀點來說  我們也都很像
Which means, hey, glass half full, we all have a lot in common.

1512
01:33:54,690 --> 01:33:57,520
我們越是努力瞭解別人
And the more we try to understand one another.

1513
01:33:57,680 --> 01:34:00,010
越會變得出色
The more exceptional each of us will be.

1514
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,190
但凡事都要去嘗試
But we have to try.

1515
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:06,970
不管你是什麼類型的動物
So no matter what type of animal you are.

1516
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:12,450
從巨大的大象到第一隻狐狸警官
From the biggest elephant, to our first fox.

1517
01:34:14,070 --> 01:34:15,650
我懇請你們
I implore you.

1518
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:20,720
努力嘗試  讓世界變得更美好
Try... Try to make the world a better place.

1519
01:34:21,730 --> 01:34:24,050
{\an8}尼古拉斯·P·王爾德警官

1520
01:34:22,900 --> 01:34:28,560
審視自己的內心  從改變自己開始
Look inside yourself and recognize that change starts with you.

1521
01:34:30,130 --> 01:34:35,990
從我做起  從我們做起
It starts with me. It starts with all of us.

1522
01:34:35,940 --> 01:34:39,670
{\an8}動物城警察學校

1523
01:34:42,720 --> 01:34:46,250
好了好了  安靜
All right, all right, enough. Shut it!

1524
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:50,590
今早我們來了幾位新人
We have some new recruits with us this morning.

1525
01:34:50,710 --> 01:34:52,330
包括第一隻狐狸警官
Including our first fox.

1526
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:54,340
誰在乎呢
Who cares.

1527
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,070
你的話應該印到雞湯卡片上  長官
You should have your own line of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

1528
01:34:57,070 --> 01:34:58,730
閉嘴  王爾德
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

1529
01:34:59,090 --> 01:35:00,240

01:35:17,900 --> 01:35:21,500
接到投訴  薩凡納中心有人飆車
We have reports of a street racer tearing up Savannah Central.

1536
01:35:21,680 --> 01:35:23,750
找到他  把他緝捕歸案
Find him. Shut him down.

1537
01:35:24,070 --> 01:35:27,860
兔子開車都那麼爛嗎  還是只是你
So are all the rabbits bad drivers, or is it just you?

1538
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,450
抱歉

真的嗎
Do I know that?

1543
01:35:39,290 --> 01:35:41,580
是的  是真的
Yes. Yes, I do.

1544

Good evening, Zootopia!

1550
01:36:15,080 --> 01:36:17,770
各位  舉起你們的雙爪
Come on, everybody. Put your paws up.
