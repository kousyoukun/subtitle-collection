Ugh. I'm so nervous.

1622
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:34,875
Okay. Press Conference 101.

You wanna IOOk smart?

1624
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:37,579
Answer their question
with your own question...

"Yes. Yes, it was." You see?

You should be there with me.

We did this together.

1632
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,269
Hmm. Funny you should say that...

1633
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,729
because I've been thinking...

1634
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:04,443
It would be nice to have a partner.

1635
01:10:09,080 --> 01:10:12,038

Yes?

1648
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,477
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

1649
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:43,274
(STAMMERS) Well, the animals
in question, um...

1650
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:48,441
Are they all different species?

1651

Yes. Yes, they are.

so what is the connection?

1653
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,206
Oh, all we know is that they...

1654
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,916
are all members of the predator family.

1655
01:10:58,463 --> 01:11:01,125
SO, predators are
the only ones going savage?

We still don't know.

1659
01:11:09,682 --> 01:11:13,300
It may have something
to do with biology.

SHEEP REPORTER: What do you
mean by that?

1661
01:11:14,979 --> 01:11:16,890
A biological component.

1662
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:20,436
You know, something in their DNA.

1663
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:23,526
In their DNA? Can you
elaborate on that, please?

1664
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:27,614
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands Of years ago...

1665
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:33,821
uh, predators survived through
their aggressive...

hunting instincts.

1667

For whatever reason...

1668
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,207
they seem to be reverting back...

I just stated the facts of the case.

a bunny could go savage.

Right. But a fox could, huh?

you need to carry around fox repellent?
