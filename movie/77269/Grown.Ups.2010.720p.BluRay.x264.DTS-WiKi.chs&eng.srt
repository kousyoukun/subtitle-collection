如果转到梯子 你就可以爬上去
And you spin. If you land on a ladder, you get to climb up the ladder.

Stop texting the nanny. You know how gross that is...

...for a kid to text his nanny? Just go down the hallway.

74
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:56,661
为什么? 你给其他人也发短信的
Why? You text everybody.

00:14:23,263 --> 00:14:25,060
Roxanne有个时装秀

271
00:14:25,232 --> 00:14:26,699
天哪 多可惜啊
Oh, my God, that's a shame.

272
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,097
但你们在米兰会玩的很开心的
Oh, but you're gonna have so much fun in Milan.

273
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:32,238
詹妮弗・洛佩兹和马克・安东尼 去年就在那渡假的
You know, J Lo and Marc Anthony vacationed there last year.

274
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,568
就在Lake Como的那条街上 乔治・克鲁尼的别墅旁边
It's up the street from Lake Como, where George Clooney has a villa.

276
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:37,642
我八卦杂志看太多啦
I read too many of those magazines.

277
00:14:37,811 --> 00:14:39,142
- 不 - 来吧 抱歉

- He hates when I talk about this. - We'll just...

279

我们回去了 真不好意思 是不是?
We are backing away. Ashamed, right?

280
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,814
对了 汤姆・克鲁斯也在那儿结婚的
Oh, and Tom Cruise got married there too.

281
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,151
- 谢谢你告诉我 - 什么?
- Thanks for letting me know. - What?

282
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:52,450
我不明白你为什么必须租整个周末
Well, I don't understand why you had to rent it for a whole weekend.

283
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,153
因为是假期 单独一晚人家不租给你
Because it's a holiday. They won't rent it to you for one night.

284
00:14:56,329 --> 00:14:59,628
那当你困在沉闷的米兰时 你朋友们可以狂欢了
So your friends are partying all weekend while you're stuck in Milan.

285
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,096
- 是啊 - 你真是贴心啊
- Yeah. - That was nice of you.

286
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,532
应该说我们俩很贴心 也是你的钱吧?
It was nice of us. It's your money too, isn't it?

287
00:15:03,703 --> 00:15:06,570
是啊 是你的钱 也是他的 还是我的
Yeah, it's your money, it's his money, it's my money.

288
00:15:06,773 --> 00:15:09,173
我们把钱混一起然后分了吧
Let's put all our cash in a pile and split it.

289
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:11,867
不错的帽子 给房间里带来生气
That's a nice hat, it brings out the death in the room.

290
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,310
抱歉 我很紧张 葬礼搞得我怪怪的
I'm sorry, I'm nervous. And it's a funeral, I get weird.

291
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,520

You think he represents Hulk Hogan?

294
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:29,093
不可能
No way.

295
00:15:29,562 --> 00:15:32,053
那他也没那么大牌吧?
Then he ain't that big, is he?

296
00:15:32,832 --> 00:15:36,859
顺便说下 有人问的话就说Rita是个交换生
By the way, if anyone asks, Rita is an exchange student.

297
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:42,504
Andre
Andre.

298
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,111
我想我坐在你的计算器上了
I think I just sat on your adding machine.

299
00:15:46,713 --> 00:15:49,682
现在我知道鱼缸是怎么回事了
Now I know what happened to the fish tank.

300
00:15:51,051 --> 00:15:53,281
Robert教练 人称哨音Ferdinando
Coach Robert "The Buzzer" Ferdinando...

301
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:55,387
是一个守护者
...was a caretaker by profession.

302
00:15:55,555 --> 00:16:00,015
这是多么美好的一个词 来总结他毕生的贡献
What a wonderful word to describe his devotion to his fellow man.

303
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:02,627
他全力以赴的去守护
He truly took care.

304
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:05,322
当Robert知道他时日不多时
When Robert knew that his time was short...

305
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,023
他告诉我 他想让一个人
...he told me there was one specific man he wanted...

306
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,465
说几句话 来悼念他
...to say a few words to memorialize him.

307
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,038
请Lenny Feder上台吧
So I'd like to ask Lenny Feder to come up now.

308
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:24,712
抱歉 我完全没有准备
I'm sorry, I'm not prepared at all.

309
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,284
教练让我上来讲话
I feel very honored...

310
00:16:28,254 --> 00:16:30,313
我感到很荣幸 可是
...that coach asked me to do this, but...

311
00:16:31,725 --> 00:16:36,458
同时也感到很内疚 因为我已经很久没来看望他了
I also feel terrible because I haven't seen the coach in so long.

312
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:40,087
他一直希望我能来这里见见他
And he always wanted me to come to town and see him...

313
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:44,100
但我总是忙于自己的事 抽不开身 我感到很后悔
...and I got caught up in what I've been doing and I regret it.

314
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,931
我知道1978年的St. Mark队
I understand that the St. Mark's team of 1978...

315
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:52,044
是教练的唯一一支冠军队
...was the only championship team that the coach ever had...

316
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,747
就我们当时的资质而言
...and that's very impressive, I gotta say...

317
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:58,611
确实令人印象深刻
...judging from the talent we had to offer.

318
00:16:58,785 --> 00:17:00,616
信不信由你们
I mean, believe it or not...

319
00:17:00,787 --> 00:17:05,281
1978年Robbie和Marcus比现在还矮
...Robbie and Marcus were actually shorter back in 1978.

320
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,352
但他们掌握了一项你从没学会的技巧
But those guys had a skill you never mastered.

321
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,723
他们懂得传球
They knew how to pass the ball.

322
00:17:11,598 --> 00:17:15,864
看来某人得学学把炸鸡传给别人
Looks like somebody has to learn how to pass the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

323
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:18,902
开玩笑的
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

324
00:17:19,072 --> 00:17:22,303
我们五个已经过完了生命的大部分
We're saying goodbye to a big part of our lives. All of us.

325
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:26,605
你影响了在场的每一个人
You affected everybody in this room.

326
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:31,311
希望我们能有像你一样的人生
And I hope we get to live our lives like you.

327
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:37,787
在生命的终场铃声响起时 心安无憾
Have no regrets when life's final buzzer sounds.

328
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,990
让我们为他默哀
So let's all bow our heads in silence.

329
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,475
你讲完 就该结束的
They should have just ended it right after you.

330
00:17:57,644 --> 00:17:59,305
这太蠢了
This is insanity.

331
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:00,707
是的
Yeah.

332
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,642
五块钱赌他会单腿跪下
Five bucks it takes him down on one knee.

333
00:18:05,051 --> 00:18:06,575
好啊
You're on.

334
00:18:14,094 --> 00:18:15,755
别那样
<i>Stop it.</i>

335
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,059
你长不大吗?
Grow up, will you?

336
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,633
噢 看看他
Oh, look at him now.

337
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,337
别这么生气嘛 Robbie
Don't get so mad there, Robbie.

338
00:19:01,241 --> 00:19:04,142
Rob女朋友如何? 我们该为他高兴还是...
So how we feeling about Rob's girl? We're happy for him, or...?

339
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,040
噢 天 那个德国大妈? 她看起来还行
Oh, my God. The St. Pauli Grandma? She seems all right.

340
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:08,578
她挺可爱的
She's pretty.

341
00:19:08,748 --> 00:19:10,613
有点... 我爱戴假发 的感觉
You know, in a "me in a wig" sort of way.

342
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,182
对 就是
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

343
00:19:14,387 --> 00:19:17,879
富兰克林绑在风筝上 吸引闪电的那把钥匙
When Ben Franklin was flying that kite and it had the key on it...

344
00:19:18,057 --> 00:19:19,991
就是她家的
...that was to her apartment.

345
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,025
啊 太对了
Oh, that was good, man.

346
00:19:22,195 --> 00:19:26,564
但我不得不说 他看上去是真心的
You know, but I gotta say, he seems like he's in love, you know?

347
00:19:26,733 --> 00:19:28,758
他对他前三任老婆都是真心的
He was in love with the first three wives.

348
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,664
一个骗子 一个暴力妹和一个暴食女
The Cheater, the Beater and the Eater.

349
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:34,273
他的问题在于每次都 太快陷入爱河而无法自拔
You know, his problem is he's always so overly in love so quick, you know?

350
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,568
然后某天他一发飙就把一切都搅黄了
And then one day he snaps and then it gets ugly in a hurry.

351
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,109
您的咖啡 Feder先生

I mean, thank you. That's cool of you to voluntarily wanna give me coffee.

354
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:48,981

Just, you drink it, you know, while you're studying inside the church.

355
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:51,181
但您给我发短信 说要喝咖啡

370
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,598

各位 欢迎回到1978年的湖畔别墅
Welcome back to 1978, everybody. The lake house.

406
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,840
一切都没变 真难以置信
Nothing's changed, it's unbelievable.

407
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,943
我记得没这么大啊
I don't remember this big.

408
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:27,739
这是我的厨房 就是它了
This is my kitchen. This is it, right now.

409

噢 够了 别再提厨房了
Oh, please, enough with the kitchen.

410
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,042
什么意思?
Why you so mean?

411
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,548
我们可以这么干
We could've done this.

412
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,051
- 一架风琴 - 噢我的天 瞧这厨房
- An organ. - Oh, my God, look at this kitchen.

413
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:37,689
- 够了 - 你就不能哄哄我吗?
- That's enough, already. - Could you at least humor me?

414
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:39,688
这是拓展训练营之类的地方么?
Is this like an Outward Bound thing?

415
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,759
这里很像"迷失"里的场景
I mean, it's like an episode of <i>Lost</i>.

416
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,693
宝贝 别这么锤琴
Hon, you might not wanna bang on that.

417
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,593
我喜欢这么玩
But I like playing it like this.

418
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:48,233
行了 行了
Okay. Okay.

419

好了 大家听着 房间怎么分?
So listen, guys, who's getting what room?

420
00:22:50,636 --> 00:22:53,104
实际上我给各位做了张房间表
Actually, I made a map of who gets which room.

421
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:56,070
我预留了有水垫床的房间
I took the liberty of reserving the room with the waterbed...

422
00:22:56,242 --> 00:22:57,971
给Gloria和我自己
...for Gloria and myself.

423
00:22:58,745 --> 00:23:02,112
你今晚要仰泳式啊

我今晚也要跟你们一起游泳
I wanna go swimming with you guys tonight.

425
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:07,749
哦 亲爱的 我的意思 不是真的游泳 而是
Oh, honey, we're not really going swimming. What I meant was...

426
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,320
行了 她不需要知道什么意思
That's okay. She doesn't need to know what you mean.

427
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:13,789
- 我都不知道你什么意思 - 噢我知道她什么意思
- I don't even know what you mean. - Oh, I know what she meant.

428
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,295
回到选房间的话题来
Anyway, let's get back to the room picking.

429
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:18,657
Rob 你愿意带我们参观一下么?
Rob, would you like to take us on a tour?

430
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:21,732
我很愿意带你们四处看看 Gloria只是照顾气氛
I'd love to show you a tour. Gloria was just trying to be cool.

431
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:23,493
我要离厕所近的房间
I need someplace near a bathroom.

432
00:23:23,669 --> 00:23:25,967
为什么老太婆能去游泳而我不能?
Why does the grandma get to go swimming and I don't?

433
00:23:26,139 --> 00:23:27,766

让这些孩子们呆在一起 干点孩子们的事 会比较有趣
It's a fun time for the kids to be together and they can do kids' things.

440
00:23:43,156 --> 00:23:45,351
去吧 你们共享这间主卧
Come on, go share it. Share the master bedroom.

那是电视的后半部分
That's the rest of the TV.

448
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:04,966
这里并不都是平板电视 孩子

You know, I actually have a poultice I make, using maize and herbs.

455

说玉米就行了 玉蜀黍棒就是玉米棒
Just say corn. Maize is corn, everybody.

456
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:26,722
是的 他说玉蜀黍 听起来多神秘
Yeah, he says maize because it sounds more mystical.

457
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:29,527
我喜欢他的说法 "玉蜀黍棒"
Well, I like the way he said it. "Maize."

458
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:31,294
- "玉蜀黍棒" - "玉蜀黍棒"
- "Maize." - "Maize."

459
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:33,336
- "玉蜀黍棒" - "玉蜀黍棒"
- "Maize." - "Maize."

460
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:36,600
- 听起来很奇妙 不行吗? - 玉蜀黍 真 棒
- It's fantastic, okay? - It's a-maize-ing.

直接将它敷在患处
...and then I apply it directly to the affected area.

463
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:49,088
好吧 我的患处有点大
Okay. Well, my affected area is pretty big.

469
00:25:02,668 --> 00:25:04,504
你的话过分了 娘娘腔
You're stepping over the line, woman.

470

Curly他声带被剪了
Curly, he had his vocal cords clipped.

472

邻居总是抱怨
A neighbor filed a complaint...

473
00:25:18,317 --> 00:25:22,378
所以要么剪掉Curly的声带 要么剪掉它脑袋
...so it was either clip the cords or put Curly down.

474
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,716

He'll be rubbing her boob with his beard soon.

481

He's gonna get a milk mustache on a real mustache. That won't look right.

Can't Roxanne go without you and you can meet her there?

不行 我们是绝世拍档 形影不离
No, we are a team, me and my lady, and we do everything together.

668
00:34:09,982 --> 00:34:12,917

It's not what you said. It's how you said it.

669

我可不是什么神经质的工作狂妇

793
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,426
你已经尿了三次了
You made three already.

794
00:39:57,829 --> 00:39:59,797
肯定是才来的尿吧
It must be just oozing out at this point.

795
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,626
闭嘴 我要集中精神
Shut up, I'm trying to concentrate.

796
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,893
只是尿个尿 又不是高考
It's taking a piss, not the SATs.

797
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,807
这是尿尿 还是拖拉机熄火? 什么声音?
Are you peeing or is a diesel truck turning off? What the hell is that?

798
00:40:15,547 --> 00:40:17,276
大家注意听
Listen to hamper bottom.

799
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,815
他是在发莫尔斯电码
I think he's sending a message in Morse code.

800
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:21,950
我老了 停
Getting old. Stop.

801
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,917
尿不出了 停
Can't pee. Stop.

802
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:25,814
气味像榴莲了 停
Reeks like asparagus. Stop.

803
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:28,084
我就是尿不出了 停
Even though I didn't even have any. Stop.

804
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,660
可喜的是有女孩收到信息了
The good news is these girls are gonna say hi to it.

805
00:40:31,696 --> 00:40:33,687
- 怎么了 女士们? - 嘿 女孩们
- What's up, ladies? - Hey, girls.

806
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:37,159
- 太恶心了 - 看到了吧?
- That is so gross-looking. - Did you see that?

807
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:41,237
- 不是所有的都长那样 - 你那家伙有300磅吧
- They don't all look like that, ladies. - You gave that thing 300 pounds...

808
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:42,498
拜托
Come on.

809
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:49,343
你做了盘混音磁带吗 Robbie
Sick mix tape you made, Robbie.

810
00:40:49,514 --> 00:40:53,211
- 是的 - 嘿 伙计们 我也带了些东西
- Oh, yeah. - Hey, guys, I brought something too.

811
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:55,478
- 不会吧 - 就是那篮网
- Get out of here. - It's the net, yeah.

812
00:40:55,654 --> 00:40:57,053
冠军赛的
Championship game.

813
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:59,690
- 让我看看 - 我觉得教练应该拥有它
- Let me see that. - I thought the coach should have it.

814
00:40:59,858 --> 00:41:02,292
Robbie 把这个套骨灰盒上吧
Robbie, you gotta put this on the urn, buddy.

815
00:41:02,461 --> 00:41:03,519
很好
That's cool.

816
00:41:03,728 --> 00:41:06,253
- "你踩线了" - Bailey
- "Your foot was on the line." - Bailey.

817
00:41:06,431 --> 00:41:10,026
如果教练听到这废话 会怎么说呢?
What do you think the coach would've said if he heard that trash-talking?

818
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:12,067
如果我们不去把那人灭了 我们就会被教练灭了
He'd kick our ass for not kicking his.

819
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:14,000
- 对 - 或者用学校的老办法解决
- Yeah. - Or we do it the old-school way.

820
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:16,538
- 让Eric帮我们灭 - 对 就该这样
- Have Eric beat his ass for us. - I know, we should.

821
00:41:16,708 --> 00:41:20,644
不 我这辈子只剩8次灭人的机会了
No, no, no. I got about eight seconds of fighting, total, left in my life.

822
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,780
我得省着点 以免进了局子被爆...
And I'm saving that in case I get mugged...

823
00:41:22,948 --> 00:41:25,849
或者遇到谁买汉堡时插我队...
...or, you know, someone cuts in front of me at Burger King.

824
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:29,316
- 这才是我兄弟 - 不能再耽误了 伙计们
- That's my hamper bottom. - We can't delay it anymore, guys.

825
00:41:29,488 --> 00:41:32,582
- 他刚咬了一口鸡块 - 现在开始吗?
- He just bit his chicken. All right. - Are we going? Okay.

826
00:41:32,757 --> 00:41:34,122
开始吧
Let's do it.

827
00:41:34,292 --> 00:41:37,261
我想教练是与我们同在的
You know, I think the coach is here with us.

828
00:41:37,896 --> 00:41:41,388
他肯定很骄傲 能以骨灰的方式与我们同在
I think he's proud to be here with us in ash form.

829
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,296
此时此刻在这岛上 我们曾经躲避父母的伊甸园里
Right here on this island, where we hid from our parents...

830
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,937
现在用来躲避妻儿
...and where we're hiding from our wives and children.

831
00:41:47,105 --> 00:41:48,163
对 都在这里
Yes, we are.

832
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,870
再见了...
Goodbye to you...

833
00:41:53,812 --> 00:41:55,040
...我们的朋友...
...friend...

834
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,681
...我们的领航员...
...wise-advice giver...

835
00:42:05,824 --> 00:42:07,792
...哨音复读机...
...buzzer-noise maker.

836
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,099
Rob 别这样
Rob, come on.

837
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,668
我确实搞砸了我的婚姻
I really messed up my marriages.

838
00:42:19,004 --> 00:42:20,232
所有的
All of them.

839
00:42:20,405 --> 00:42:22,100
是我的错 伙计们
It was my fault, man.

840
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,864
我就是忍不住
I just couldn't hang on.

841
00:42:24,509 --> 00:42:26,875
而我的女儿们
You know, my own daughters...

842
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:29,576
我甚至都不怎么了解她们
...I don't even hardly know them.

843
00:42:29,981 --> 00:42:32,211
- 教练肯定以我为耻 - 不会的
- The Buzzer would be ashamed of me. - No.

844
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,408
没事的
Come on, now.

845
00:42:33,585 --> 00:42:35,985
你还有很多时间去改善和女儿的关系
You got time to patch things up with your daughters.

846
00:42:36,154 --> 00:42:38,384
回去的时候 给她们电话吧
You just call them when you get back.

847
00:42:38,557 --> 00:42:42,084
实际上 还有20分钟 她们就会到这了
Actually, they're gonna be here in about 20 minutes.

848
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:44,993
等等 你说什么?
Wait, what?

849
00:42:45,163 --> 00:42:46,596
我先啃个鸡腿
I can use a piece of chicken.

850
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:49,396
别 别用教练的手
No, not with those hands. Coach hands. All right.

851
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,762
整桶都归你了
Finish the bucket.

852
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:54,303
实际上 我还是要吃 虽然很恶心 但我饿死了
Actually, I'm still gonna eat it. This is pretty sick, but I'm hungry.

853
00:43:01,613 --> 00:43:03,103
Lamonsoff
Lamonsoff.

854
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:06,649
把桶扔了吧
Go, old bucket. Drop it.

855
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:25,233
烂车一辆
Piece of crap car.

856
00:43:26,037 --> 00:43:27,504
什么情况?
What?

857
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,331
嘿 老爸
Hey, Dad.

858
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,999
我?
Me?

859
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,710
什么?
What?

860
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:38,007
- 这瘪三 - 嘿
- How do you get that... - Hey.

861
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:39,377
怎么生出她来的?
...from that?

862
00:43:39,884 --> 00:43:42,512
百分之九十五遗传自她妈妈
Ninety-five percent of that's gotta be from the mother.

863
00:43:42,687 --> 00:43:44,279
这是最保守估计
And I am lowballing.

864
00:43:44,456 --> 00:43:45,684
嗨 Jasmine
Hey, Jasmine.

865
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,517
这怎么可能啊?
How is that possible?

866
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:49,785
噢 猫王的头发插到她鼻子了
Oh, no. The Elvis hairs are going up her nose.

867
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,519
很尴尬啊
She doesn't know what to do.

868
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:52,720
够体贴
That's sweet.

869
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:54,194
这是你的车?
Is this your car?

870
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:57,132
我的老男人借了我这坨狗屎
My old man lent me this turd.

871
00:43:57,636 --> 00:44:00,696
因为他可不在乎我会半路抛锚
Because he doesn't care if I break down in the middle of nowhere...

872
00:44:00,872 --> 00:44:02,499
然后被熊吃掉
...and get eaten by a bear.

873
00:44:02,674 --> 00:44:03,971
你的老男人?
Your old man?

874
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,906
对 我男朋友 57岁
Yeah, my boyfriend. Forty-seven years old.

875
00:44:07,078 --> 00:44:09,239
你知道 我也期盼能喜欢上同龄男生
You know, I wish I liked guys my own age...

876
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,474
但因为没爹 所以更需要父爱
...but I'm just chasing the dad that ran out on me.

877
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,463
爽歪歪啊
Hoochie mama.

878
00:44:28,667 --> 00:44:30,328
啥意思?
What does that mean?

879
00:44:30,802 --> 00:44:33,396
不知道 脱口而出的
I don't know, but it feels right.

880
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,437
我希望那辆车永远修不好
I hope that car never gets fixed.

881
00:44:43,648 --> 00:44:44,774
我也希望
I don't think it will.

882
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,348
我拔掉了火花塞
I took the spark plugs out.

883
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:47,712
多谢
Nice.

884
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:53,485
我们全部一直盯着不好吧 至少转下头吧
We're all looking at the same time. Let's at least take shifts.

885
00:44:53,658 --> 00:44:55,421
Lamonsoff 你和我先看树那边
Lamonsoff, you and me look at the tree.

886
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:58,153
McKenzie 我们先来看看她的丰臀
McKenzie, we're gonna look at her butt for a little bit.

887
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,160
好计划
All right. Good plan.

888
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:02,625
换
And, shift.

889
00:45:05,236 --> 00:45:06,362
换
Shift.

890
00:45:07,572 --> 00:45:09,506
换
Shift.

891
00:45:10,408 --> 00:45:11,670
换
Shift.

892
00:45:12,143 --> 00:45:13,440
换
And shift.

893
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:16,176
我们在干啥?
What are we doing?

894
00:45:16,548 --> 00:45:18,778
等等 我们都在看树吗?
Wait, are we all looking at the tree right now?

895
00:45:18,983 --> 00:45:20,746
是的 那我们一起看回屁股
Yeah. Let's go back to the ass.

896
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:23,586
嘿 Jasmine 这是Gloria
Hey, Jasmine. This is Gloria.

897
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,814
Gloria 这是Jasmine
Gloria, this is Jasmine.

898
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,457
嗨
Hi.

899
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:31,796
噢 Gloria奶奶过来圆场了
Oh, look, here comes Grandma Gloria to the rescue.

900
00:45:31,963 --> 00:45:33,988
让我看看
Let me take a look.

901
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,225
噢 亲爱的
Oh, honey.

902
00:45:37,402 --> 00:45:40,166
密封垫被你动过了
You've blown your gasket.

903
00:45:58,189 --> 00:46:00,282
没啥好看了
No good.

904
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,862
大喜大悲啊
That was rough.

905
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:06,453
如果他俩修车时都算恶心的话
If you guys thought seeing them at the car was gross...

906
00:46:06,631 --> 00:46:08,758
那你们应该听听他们的仰泳
...you should have heard that waterbed action.

907
00:46:08,933 --> 00:46:11,458
就像两只熊在抢鲑鱼
Sounded like two grizzlies fighting over a salmon.

908
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,434
- 那可是很大的动作啊 - 至少他还能做
- There was a lot happening. - At least he's getting something.

909
00:46:14,606 --> 00:46:17,336
老婆怀孕后我就进了冷宫
I've been shut out since Deanne found out she was pregnant.

910
00:46:17,509 --> 00:46:20,137
- 这是肯定的 - 老婆怀孕时还能做?
- That'll happen. - You have sex when they're pregnant?

911
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:22,176
- 不会伤害小孩吗? - McKenzie可以
- Does that hurt the baby? - McKenzie can.

912
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:24,338
宝宝会以为是个手指在摸他
The baby thinks he's getting a Tootsie Roll.

913
00:46:24,549 --> 00:46:26,847
- 很好 - 像士力架
- That's good. - Snickers. Snickers.

914
00:46:27,018 --> 00:46:28,679
还是大点的
A little bigger. A little bigger.

915
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:32,516
那年Saint Paddy节我交了桃花运 不过对方半梦半醒的
I got lucky on Saint Paddy's Day, but she was half-asleep.

916
00:46:28,853 --> 00:46:32,516
{\a6}每年3月17日，爱尔兰的节日

917
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:34,590
说是半梦半醒 其实就是睡着了
And by half-asleep, I mean she was asleep.

918
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:36,226
对 不省人事了
Yeah, she was out. Yeah.

919
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:37,656
其实就是让你上
You're allowed to do that.

920
00:46:37,829 --> 00:46:39,490
她才不想醒着呢
She'd rather not be awake.

921
00:46:39,664 --> 00:46:43,395
- 嘿 你那女儿怎么样了? - 别提了
- Hey, how'd it go with the daughter? - Awkward.

922
00:46:44,803 --> 00:46:48,671
或许一个孩子的头20年 要比我想的重要
I guess the first 20 years of a kid's life is more important than I realized.

923
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,135
是啊 总是孩子在付出
Yeah. It's always the kids who pay.

924
00:46:51,309 --> 00:46:52,674
是孩子
Kids pay.

925
00:46:52,844 --> 00:46:54,209
- 是孩子 - 是孩子
- They pay. - They pay.

926
00:46:54,379 --> 00:46:56,643
- 总是他们付出 - 付出了玉蜀黍
- They always pay. - But they pay with maize.

927
00:46:56,815 --> 00:46:58,339
跟你们一起真开心

明天还要去米兰是吧? 要飞好久呢
We're going to Milan tomorrow, right? A long flight.

1059
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:22,051
休息吧
Let's get our rest.

1060
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:27,659
谁去把那火鸡宰了
Somebody kill that turkey.

1061
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,341
我这是性奋吗?
Is that getting me horny?

1062
00:54:41,178 --> 00:54:42,406
没错
Yes.

1063
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,715
答应我等我们走了你还喂她
You promise you'll still feed her after we leave?

1064
00:54:45,883 --> 00:54:47,316
我答应你
I promise.

1065
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:49,112
妈咪 那是我的奶
Mommy, that's my milk.

1066
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:52,154
Bean 我们要学会分享 哪怕是只鸟鸟
Bean, we have to learn how to share, even with birds.

1067
00:54:52,323 --> 00:54:54,814
可他都把你喝干了
But he's going to drink you dry.

1068
00:55:01,232 --> 00:55:02,597
扔得好
This is good.

1069
00:55:11,742 --> 00:55:13,676
我的蹦了3次
I got it three times.

1070
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,005
Donna 你要来试试吗?
Donna, you wanna try?

1071
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,673
当然 可我不擅长运动
Sure. But I stink at sports.

1072
00:55:18,849 --> 00:55:20,544
没事的 给
That's all right. Here.

1073
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:22,845
- 这样拿 - 这样?
- Hold it like this. - Like this?

1074
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:26,478
手放平再扔出去 然后这石子就有翅膀了
Get down low and throw it, and let the rock do the magic.

1075
00:55:27,958 --> 00:55:29,220
- 很好! - 噢 蹦起来了
- Nice. - Oh, I skipped it.

1076
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:32,321
- 扔得好 Donna - 太帅了
- Good job, Donna. - Bravo.

1077
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:34,054
你会打水漂吗 Feder太太?
Do you know how to skip rocks?

1078
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:36,392
你问我? 姐可是高手啊
Are you kidding me? I am the best at this.

1079
00:55:37,335 --> 00:55:40,099
拿来 都看好了
Give me that. Now, watch, now.

1080
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:46,867
哦 天啊 宝贝 你没事吧?
Oh, my God, baby, are you okay?

1081
00:55:47,044 --> 00:55:50,741
没事 妈妈 没想到你也那么喜欢玩
Yeah, Mom, I'm just glad to see you having some fun.

1082
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,775
我这就把你行李放车上去 Feder先生
I'll take your luggage to the car, Mr. Feder.

1083
00:55:53,951 --> 00:55:55,851
那不是我的行李 那是你的课本
That's not my luggage, that's textbooks.

1084
00:55:56,020 --> 00:55:58,147
我很高兴你能自己搬行李
That's nice of you to take your own stuff down.

1085
00:55:58,322 --> 00:55:59,346
你没事的 加油
You're okay. Come on.

1086
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:01,548
得了 伙计 你们这就要走了?
Come on, man. Already? You're leaving?

1087
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:02,886
对 非走不可了
Yes, I gotta go.

1088
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,051
要送你们去机场吗?
Do you need any help getting to the airport?

1089
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:06,389
亲爱的 有点小问题
We got a little problem.

1090
00:56:06,564 --> 00:56:07,792
怎么了? 出什么事了?
What? What happened?

1091
00:56:07,965 --> 00:56:10,399
我不会打水漂了
I forgot how to skip a rock.

1092
00:56:10,634 --> 00:56:14,263
我觉得我需要几天复习一下
Now, I think it's gonna take a couple of days to figure it out.

1093
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:15,698
所以...
So...

1094
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17,903
我们先别走了吧
...I think we better stay.

1095
00:56:18,075 --> 00:56:19,235
你没开玩笑吧?
Are you kidding me?

1096
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,038
真的吗 妈妈? 我们不走了?
For reals, Mom? We're not leaving?

1097
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:26,206
不走了 没必要去看那些瘦骨嶙峋的 模特穿着我设计的衣服瞎逛
I don't need to see a bunch of starving models walking around in my clothes.

1098
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:29,217
是啊 看什么模特啊? 他们哪会哥这样
Yeah, why would you wanna see models when you can see this?

1099
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:33,915
瞧见没? 在米兰可看不到
See? You couldn't get that in Milan.

1100
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:36,483
你啊你
You.

1101
00:56:36,660 --> 00:56:37,888
你啊你
You.

1102
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:40,259
你今天想干什么? 随便吩咐
What do you wanna do today? Anything.

1103
00:56:40,431 --> 00:56:41,898
不知道 你说咧?
I don't know. You tell me.

1104
00:56:42,066 --> 00:56:45,729
你12岁时遇到好天气会最想玩什么?
What was your favorite thing to do when you were 12 and it was sunny?

1105
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:47,996
哦 这可不行
Well, I can't do that.

1106
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:52,269
要不... 去水上世界吧
Maybe go to a water park.

1107
00:56:52,443 --> 00:56:53,671
那还等什么?
What are we waiting for?

1108
00:56:53,844 --> 00:56:55,869
- 真的假的? - 准备好车子出发
- Seriously? - Let's load up the car, people.

1109
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:57,070
真的假的啊?
Are you kidding me?

1110
00:56:57,248 --> 00:57:00,684
- 我不脱衣服 - 我也不脱衣服
- I'm not taking my shirt off. - I'm not taking my shirt off either.

1111
00:57:04,355 --> 00:57:05,686
都浪费了
You're wasting it.

1112
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:07,181
抱歉
Sorry.

1113
00:57:08,926 --> 00:57:10,416
没事
It's all right.

1114
00:57:11,328 --> 00:57:13,063
其实味道还不差
It's actually not that bad.

1115
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:24,268
- 今天可是美女秀 - 好吗? 你看好他们
- Ladies' day. - All right? You're in charge.

1116
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,568
我要嘘嘘
I have to go number two.

1117
00:57:29,747 --> 00:57:31,214
好吧 再憋会 儿子
Okay, hang on, son.

1118
00:57:31,482 --> 00:57:32,506
嘿 老爸
Hey, Dad.

1119
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:34,514
嘿 你们去哪了?
Hey. Where you guys been?

1120
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:38,314
我们没带泳衣 Marcus带我们去买了
Well, we didn't bring our swimsuits, so Marcus went to take us to buy some.

1121
00:57:41,325 --> 00:57:43,452
是家叫"小坏坏"的店
We got them at a store called Naughty and Nice.

1122
00:57:43,627 --> 00:57:45,652
Marcus说就这一家开着
Marcus said it was the only one open.

1123
00:57:45,830 --> 00:57:49,459
大夏天就这么一家卖泳衣?
The only place open? For bathing suits? In the summer?

1124
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:53,168
我这件是在"走过路过不错过"买的
We got my bathing suit at Stop and Shop.

1125
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:55,864
这件...我喜欢
Now, that's... I like that one.

1126
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,735

- 真要穿泳衣吗? - 哦 这天真热
- Are we really doing bathing suits? - God, it's hot.

1133
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,988
得了 姐们 反正又没人认识我们 怕什么?
Come on, girls. We don't know these people. Who cares?

1134
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:24,123
对啊 怕什么? 整个夏天 我都裹着这破布
You're right, who cares? I've been working all summer on this six-pack.

1135
00:58:24,301 --> 00:58:25,325
好了
All right.

1136
00:58:25,503 --> 00:58:27,095

How do you feel about that?

1137
00:58:27,271 --> 00:58:31,332
- BB到前面来 - 来吧 大D 来吧 大D
- Baby got front. - Go, D. Go, D.

1138
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,500

Come on, Sally, it's your turn. Take it off.

1139
00:58:33,677 --> 00:58:35,645

Oh, no. I have a bit of a chill, actually.

1140
00:58:35,813 --> 00:58:36,837
Gloria 那你呢?
Gloria, how about you?

1141
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:39,881
我没泳衣 但我喜欢全光
I don't own a bathing suit. But I like to go nude.

1142
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:42,541
- 不 不 不 - 这里还有小孩呢
- No, no, no. - There's children here.

嘿 有人在打望呢
Hey, somebody likes what he sees.

1144
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,900
- 老爸 这队伍稳如泰山啊 - 就是
- Daddy, this line's not even moving. - I know.

1145
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:08,408
- 说的是 - 我要喝妈咪的奶
- I know. - I want Mommy's milk.

1146
00:59:08,579 --> 00:59:10,069
我知道你要喝 儿子 可是...
I know you do, son, but...

1147
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:12,807
他要喝妈咪的奶 就给他妈咪的奶啊
He wants mommy's milk. Give him some mommy's milk.

1148
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:14,712

1150
00:59:16,487 --> 00:59:17,977
不准再喝妈了
No more Mommy's milk, okay?

1151
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,419
要喝 就喝牛
You want milk, you're drinking regular milk.

1152
00:59:20,591 --> 00:59:22,650
- 拿来 小朋友 - 嘿

Don't give me any guff right now. Here's a buck. Run along. Run along.

拿着 把盒子里的牛奶喝了
Here. Drink the milk out of the carton.

1155
00:59:28,232 --> 00:59:30,826
不知道妈咪让不让我喝
I don't know if Mommy will want me to.

1156
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:34,937
你就只管喝好了 看你老爸怎么喝的 老爸教你喝好不好
All right, just drink it, okay? Just like Daddy does. Let me show you, okay?

1157
00:59:35,105 --> 00:59:37,300

留给我们吸
More for us.

1162
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:51,946
各位姐们 有什么办法让肌肉男先生
So, ladies, how do we get Mr. Banana Hammock...

1163
00:59:52,122 --> 00:59:55,182

...to come over here, where we can get a better look at him?

1164
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:58,795
好吧 这就是母乳喂养的优势之一
Okay. Well, there's two big advantages to breast-feeding...

1165
00:59:58,996 --> 01:00:01,123

01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:16,311
- 哦 鱼快上钩了 - 你看他那身材

爸爸 我们可以走这里吗?
Dad, are we allowed to go through here?

1177
01:00:27,091 --> 01:00:29,116
当然不能 但我们还是照样进
Absolutely not, but we're doing it anyway.

1178
01:00:29,293 --> 01:00:31,955
想当年这可是你们无敌老爸找到的
All right, your cool dad found this back in the day.

1179
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:35,427
顺着梯子上去
Go up the ladder.

1180
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,329
这里面好黑的 牵好哟
It's dark in there. Maybe you should hold my hand.

1181
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:39,729
我好怕的
I'm scared.

1182

嘿 过来 过来
Hey. Come here, come here.

Don't fall for that crap. You stay away from him.

1184
01:00:44,475 --> 01:00:46,705
你说什么呢? 他不是玻璃吗?
What are you talking about? He's gay, isn't he?

1185
01:00:46,877 --> 01:00:48,606
不 他只是像玻璃
No. He just seems gay.

1186
01:00:48,779 --> 01:00:50,076
他可是老油条了
He's a genius.

1187
01:00:50,247 --> 01:00:51,646
走 走 走
Go, go, go.

1188
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:56,043

Alrighty, who's next?

1189

他让我试穿一条短裙
He wanted me to try this skirt on.

1329
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:44,179
让人试衣服的老把戏

结果就 "我只是帮帮忙"
Hey, I was just trying to help.

孩子要出来了

1343
01:10:16,246 --> 01:10:18,111
我的天 这是

Oh, this song gets me so horny.

1347
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:35,257
我也是 但现在又平静了
You know, I was thinking that, but now not so much.

1348
01:10:35,432 --> 01:10:37,024
我相信性奋这事
I'd like to claim credit for that.

1349
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,363
因为我就是靠这歌上垒的
Because that's all part of my "get some nookie" playlist.

1350
01:10:40,537 --> 01:10:43,506
带上女士下舞池 现在就是她

You know, the good news is she can't get any more stretch marks.

1455
01:16:34,457 --> 01:16:35,981
- 那是好事 - 好吧
- Boy, that's a good one. - Come on.

1456
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:41,118
还有个好消息 就是Gloria和孩子可以分享尿布
You know, the good thing also is Gloria and the kid can share diapers.

1457
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,763
这话真难听
Man. You see, that's just ugly.

1458
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,798
他不懂 他又没结婚
He doesn't get it. He's not in a committed relationship.

1459
01:16:44,968 --> 01:16:47,937
他不会明白的 因为他安定不下来
He can't, because he can't stay in a committed relationship.

1460
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:50,971
瞧 他生气了 因为跟我约会的女孩
Oh, look. He's just mad because all the girls I go out with...

1461
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:54,303
都比他老婆年轻70到80岁
...are 70 to 80 years younger than his wife.

1462
01:16:54,477 --> 01:16:55,569
还停不下来了
Can't stop.

1463
01:16:55,745 --> 01:16:59,977
我的上一个 金发 高挑 性感 不是你喜欢的那种
The last one I was with, she's blond, she's tall, super hot. Not your type.

1464
01:17:00,149 --> 01:17:03,607
我和金发美眉正起劲 一起晃床
Me and blondie, we start going at it and we're shaking the bed...

1465
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:05,981
晃床? 什么意思?
Shaking the bed? What does shaking the bed mean?

1466
01:17:06,155 --> 01:17:09,147
我不懂 我只懂湿床
I don't know, I just know wetting the bed. I don't know...

1467
01:17:09,325 --> 01:17:11,384
然后就进正题了
And then, right at the "good part." you know?

1468
01:17:11,561 --> 01:17:14,962
结果墙上挂的画掉了下来
This picture behind, right on the wall, falls and goes:

1469
01:17:15,498 --> 01:17:16,795
砸到她的额头上
Hits her on the forehead.

1470
01:17:16,966 --> 01:17:18,126
伤到头了
She cut her head.

1471
01:17:18,301 --> 01:17:19,928
破了条口 但我没有停
It cuts her. I didn't slow down.

1472
01:17:20,103 --> 01:17:23,163
我扔给她两片阿司匹林 她像接飞盘的狗一样叼住
I just throw her two aspirins, she yaps on them like a Frisbee dog.

1473
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:28,978
好累啊 Marcus 你的鼾声让我一夜未眠
I am tired. Marcus, your snoring kept me up all night long.

1474
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:35,079
你死定了 回来
You're a dead man. Get back here.

1475
01:17:35,251 --> 01:17:39,312
回来 那可是我女儿 亏我当你是朋友
Come back here. That's my baby girl. I thought you were my friend.

1476
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:41,184
走开 回去喝你的玉蜀黍
Leave me alone. Drink your maize.

1477
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:43,518
你这次死定了
You're gonna pay this time.

1478
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,492
混蛋 让你好看
You bastard. I'll show you how to be nice.

1479
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:48,927
- 臭乌龟 - 你个恶棍
- Bad turtles. - You evil pig.

1480
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:51,860
- Robbie 等等 - 你个疯子
- Robbie, wait. - He's psycho.

1481
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,297
停 停
Stop. Stop.

1482
01:17:53,469 --> 01:17:55,664
滚开
Hey, break it up, man. Jeez, guys.

1483
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:56,964
- 好的 - 冷静
- All right. - Calm down.

1484
01:17:57,140 --> 01:17:59,040
哥们 怎么了
Buddy. Buddy. What's the problem?

1485
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,873
这下好了 箭脚
Oh, yeah. Arrow foot.

1486
01:18:05,048 --> 01:18:07,710
- 搞什么 - 你们干嘛打架？
- Come here, baby. - Come on. Why are you fighting?

1487
01:18:07,884 --> 01:18:09,579
很高兴又看到侏儒摔跤了
Good to see midget wrestling again.

1488
01:18:09,752 --> 01:18:12,084
你怎么可以这样? 她可是我女儿
How could you do that? That's my daughter.

1489
01:18:12,255 --> 01:18:14,723
- 怎样了? - 和她一起晃床
- Do what? - Shake the bed with her.

1490
01:18:14,891 --> 01:18:16,916
你觉得我会这样吗?
You think I would do that to you?

1491
01:18:17,293 --> 01:18:19,591
你是我们当中唯一一个会这么做的
Out of any of us you'd be the one to do that.

1492
01:18:19,762 --> 01:18:21,957
你连Stimpson的妈妈都睡过
You did sleep with Stimpson's mother.

1493
01:18:22,131 --> 01:18:25,362
我根本不认识他 他是你朋友 但我不认识啊
I didn't even know that guy. He was your friend. I barely knew him.

1494
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:27,765
而且是她逼我的 我说过的
She grabbed my wiener, I told you guys.

1495
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:30,201
- 那可是他女儿 不一样 - 我和他?
- That's his daughter. It's different. - Me and him?

1496
01:18:31,441 --> 01:18:35,036
好吧 也许我和他调情了 但我只是想引起你的注意
Okay. Maybe I flirted with him, but that was just to get your attention.

1497
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:37,338
- 那打鼾是怎么回事? - 我也听到了
- Well, what about his snoring? - I heard it too.

1498
01:18:41,951 --> 01:18:43,919
不 又来了
Oh, no. Twice?

1499
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:45,952
隔着三个房间都能听到
We heard it from three rooms away.

1500
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:49,580
那就不可能了 Marcus不可能找你女儿的
He's off the hook. You know Marcus wouldn't be with your daughter.

1501
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:52,421
我的意思是 不是说她... 你懂的
I mean, not that she's... You know what I'm saying.

1502
01:18:53,262 --> 01:18:56,698
- 你头怎么了 - 我换睡衣时
- Well, what happened to your head? - When I was changing into my PJs...

1503
01:18:56,866 --> 01:18:59,994
感觉有变态在窗外偷看
...I got the feeling that some perv was looking through my window...

1504
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:04,037
我过去关窗户时 不小心失足撞了头
...so I went to go close the shade and I tripped and hit my head.

1505
01:19:04,574 --> 01:19:06,906
兄弟 那可是你女儿
Yeah, dude, that's your daughter.

1506
01:19:07,076 --> 01:19:09,510
我压根没和她在一起 你可是我的好哥们
I'd never be with her. You're my best friend, man.

1507
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:12,147
Jasmine也不会和我在一起的 因为是我
And Jasmine'd never be with me, because I'm me.

1508
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:15,449
看 我没有像Lenny那样 跟着谁一辈子
Look, sorry I don't have my whole life together, like Lenny.

1509
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,552
噢 Lenny跟着谁一辈子
Oh, together, like Lenny.

1510
01:19:18,221 --> 01:19:19,245
拜托
Please.

1511
01:19:19,622 --> 01:19:21,419
我接了你的电话
I answered your phone, <i>hipcrita.</i>

1512
01:19:21,591 --> 01:19:22,819
是你的助理
It was your assistant.

1513
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:25,960
我问他能否取消去米兰的航班 他说他已经取消了
I asked him if he canceled the flight to Milan. He said he did.

1514
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:27,994
而且是在我们来之前!
Before we even came here.

1515
01:19:28,164 --> 01:19:30,962
他这么说的？他怎么能这么说？ 我是说...
He said that? Why would he say that? I mean...

1516
01:19:31,134 --> 01:19:32,624
所以是他骗人了?
So he just made that up, huh?

1517
01:19:32,802 --> 01:19:34,394
我可没说他骗人
I'm not saying he made it up.

1518
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:37,266
大概是他臆想出来的
I'm think... In his head he believes it's true.

1519
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:38,998
别想忽悠我 Lenny
Don't you agent me, Lenny.

1520
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:41,609
学会尊重别人
Stop trying to handle everybody and everything...

1521
01:19:41,778 --> 01:19:44,406
别总是对别人指手画脚好吗?
...and start taking a little responsibility for once.

1522
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,105
我承担责任好吗? 你是对的
I'll take responsibility. Okay? You're right.

1523
01:19:47,283 --> 01:19:50,810
我觉得与其去米兰
I thought it would be better for our family to be here with normal people...

1524
01:19:50,987 --> 01:19:52,750
还不如和正常人一起待在这
...instead of going to Milan.

1525
01:19:52,922 --> 01:19:54,184
我们很正常?
We're normal?

1526
01:19:54,357 --> 01:19:58,088
我不敢告诉你 藏着掖着比较容易
I was scared to tell you. It was easier for me to keep it a secret.

1527
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:01,094
任何婚姻都藏着秘密
You peel back any marriage, there are secrets.

1528
01:20:01,497 --> 01:20:03,761
我的秘密就是 我爱你至深
Mine is I love you. I love you very much.

1529
01:20:03,933 --> 01:20:05,628
Roxanne  我只想说
Roxanne, I just... I...

1530
01:20:05,802 --> 01:20:10,034
孩子们 任性 骄纵惯了
Our kids are becoming nutty, snotty, spoiled...

1531
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,433
- 我们还请了保姆 - 她果然是保姆
- We got a nanny, we got... - So she is a nanny.

1532
01:20:13,609 --> 01:20:15,008
不不  她并不是保姆
No, no, no. She's not a nanny.

1533
01:20:15,178 --> 01:20:17,009
她就是个保姆
Of course she's a nanny.

1534
01:20:17,180 --> 01:20:19,205
啥时才能诚实点?
When does the lying stop?

1535
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,679
等这事儿办完
It stops right after this.

1536
01:20:20,850 --> 01:20:22,784
她更是个互惠生 不是简单的保姆
She's more of an au pair. Not a nanny.

1537
01:20:22,952 --> 01:20:24,681
Lenny
Lenny.

1538
01:20:25,388 --> 01:20:28,551
好 好 自此以后 诚恳待人
All right. That's it. The lying stops now.

1539
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:30,988
我发誓再也不骗你了
I won't lie to you ever again. I swear to God.

1540
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,457
我爱你
I love you.

1541
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:34,118
是男人就会说谎
Men lie.

1542
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:36,464
狗改不了吃屎
They can't help themselves.

1543
01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:38,566
Kurt也肯定说谎了
Kurt sure as hell lies.

1544
01:20:38,734 --> 01:20:41,225
我说什么谎了 脚丹妈妈?
What do I lie about, Toe-J Simpson?

1545
01:20:41,404 --> 01:20:43,497
拜托 保姆的事儿吧
Oh, please. The nanny.

1546
01:20:43,873 --> 01:20:44,999
保姆怎么了？
What about the nanny?

1547
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:47,199
你跟她有一腿
You have a thing for her.

1548
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:51,369
我可没偷腥! 我可是有妇之夫
I do not have a thing for the nanny. I'm a married man. Period.

1549
01:20:51,814 --> 01:20:55,443
可是我的确喜欢和 不会胡言乱语 喋喋不休16:39 2010-10-11的
But did I enjoy a nice conversation with a woman that wasn't going...

1550
01:20:55,618 --> 01:20:59,418
女士聊天
..."Where's this?" and "Did you pick up that?" Yeah.

1551
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:01,716
我们可以好好说话的啊
What, you can have nice conversations with me.

1552
01:21:02,225 --> 01:21:04,056
你不总是忙吗?
When? You're always working.

1553
01:21:04,227 --> 01:21:06,923
一到家就喊累
And when you come home, you're just tired all the time.

1554
01:21:07,129 --> 01:21:09,359
懒得看我一下 更不会碰我
You barely even touch me or look at me.

1555
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:12,228
他说话像个老娘们似的
He sounds like an old woman.

1556
01:21:12,401 --> 01:21:16,667
正如我所说 Deanne 你应该嫁给Umberto Denunzio
Deanne, you should have married Umberto Denunzio like I told you.

1557
01:21:16,839 --> 01:21:21,071
要是我跟了他 现在就该你挺着个大肚皮了 妈妈
And if I had stayed with him you'd be the one that's pregnant now, Mama.

1558
01:21:21,644 --> 01:21:23,771
想来如此 甜心
You probably right, sweetheart.

1559
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:25,670
我不狗拿耗子了
I'll just butt out.

1560
01:21:25,848 --> 01:21:27,509
不胜感激
Thank you.

1561
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:30,675
也许我确实不够重视你 我道歉
Look, maybe I do take you for granted, and I'm sorry.

1562
01:21:31,187 --> 01:21:34,281
以后 每周四晚我们都 出去甜蜜一下如何?
How's about I take you out every Thursday night for date night.

1563
01:21:34,857 --> 01:21:38,623
周四要播"实习医生格蕾" 其他晚上都可以
No, Thursday's <i>Grey's Anatomy,</i> but any other night would be beautiful.

1564
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:45,659
大家都坦白了 我也不能再隐瞒
And as long as we're all being honest, I think I should be honest too.

1565
01:21:46,702 --> 01:21:50,934
我其实不是什么草坪家具店合伙人
I'm actually not a part owner of the lawn furniture store.

1566
01:21:51,107 --> 01:21:54,042
我都不在那儿混饭吃了
I don't even work there anymore.

1567
01:21:54,210 --> 01:21:56,576
我四月份就卷铺盖了
I got laid off in April.

1568
01:21:56,746 --> 01:21:58,543
我租下凯迪拉克
But I rented the Caddy...

1569
01:21:58,714 --> 01:22:02,582
扮个大款 就是不想让你们知道
...and I acted like a big shot because I didn't want you guys to know.

1570
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:03,980
Lamonsoff
Lamonsoff.

1571
01:22:04,153 --> 01:22:06,781
你没必要瞒着我们啊 我很难过
You don't have to hide anything from us. I'm sorry.

1572
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:10,756
既然大家都敞开心扉
Yeah. Since we're getting things off our chests here...

1573
01:22:10,927 --> 01:22:13,088
我也准备坦诚相待
...I got a confession to make.

1574
01:22:15,264 --> 01:22:16,492
我戴着假发
I'm wearing a toup.

1575
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:17,997
果然这么蠢
No shit.

1576
01:22:20,303 --> 01:22:22,066
我也要坦白
I have a confession to make.

1577
01:22:23,572 --> 01:22:24,971
我其实是个男的
I'm really a man.

1578
01:22:25,641 --> 01:22:27,802
- 不是吧 - 我就说吧
- No. - I said that.

1579
01:22:27,977 --> 01:22:32,573
- 不会吧? - 我开玩笑的
- Are you kidding? - No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1580
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:35,683
你们竟然会相信 太伤心了
I'm really a little hurt that so many of you believed it.

1581
01:22:35,851 --> 01:22:38,183
- 说说罢了 - 你很有女人味
- We were just saying that... - You're very womanly.

1582
01:22:38,354 --> 01:22:42,586
不过 虽然这不是我的地盘
Nevertheless. I know it's not my place, but...

1583
01:22:42,758 --> 01:22:45,522
但是长者为尊
Well, after all, I am older than anyone here.

1584
01:22:45,695 --> 01:22:47,526
不错 您是长者
Hell, yeah, you are.

1585
01:22:49,332 --> 01:22:53,268
这里虽然又吵又闹 但也很有爱
Well, despite the joking and the razzing, I see a lot of love here.

1586
01:22:53,436 --> 01:22:56,462
而有了爱 就会有恨
And with love comes hostility.

1587
01:22:56,806 --> 01:23:00,765
比如说 Rob那天冲我发飙
Like Rob when he snapped at me the other day.

1588
01:23:00,943 --> 01:23:02,103
很吓人的
That was scary.

1589
01:23:02,278 --> 01:23:05,179
我虽表面淡定
And you all thought that I was so calm, but inside?

1590
01:23:05,348 --> 01:23:06,975
可是内心却在说
Inside I was saying:

1591
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,776
Gloria Noonan
"Gloria Noonan...

1592
01:23:09,018 --> 01:23:12,886
别骂他青蛙眼反社会小男人
...do not call him a bug-eyed sociopath with a little-man complex.

1593
01:23:13,622 --> 01:23:17,649
别数落他的头发像根掏耳屎的棉棒
Do not say that his hair makes him look like a dirty Q-tip."

1594
01:23:17,827 --> 01:23:18,851
此言得之
I like that.

1595
01:23:19,462 --> 01:23:23,228
或者笑他看起来像一个垂暮的玻璃
"Or that he resembles an elder gay Jonas brother."

1596
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:26,391
够了 他们明白了
They get it. They get the point of where you're going.

1597
01:23:26,569 --> 01:23:29,129
或者侏儒矮人什么的... 我都忍住了
"Or a midget Filipino Fonzie." I didn't say those things.

1598
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:31,569
- 正是如此 - 嘿
- That's my favorite one. - Hey.

1599
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:33,038
假发哥
Toupee.

1600
01:23:33,209 --> 01:23:35,700
生活充满艰辛
Life can be difficult sometimes.

1601
01:23:35,878 --> 01:23:38,972
道路崎岖不平 家庭 孩子...
It gets bumpy, what with family and kids...

1602
01:23:39,148 --> 01:23:42,140
并非万事如意
...and things not going exactly like you planned.

1603
01:23:42,318 --> 01:23:44,718
可正是因为这样才妙趣横生
But that's what makes it interesting.

1604
01:23:44,887 --> 01:23:48,152
生活 首先都是迷恋激情
In life, the first act, always exciting.

1605
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:50,417
接着的才是
The second act...

1606
01:23:50,860 --> 01:23:52,828
深度的思考
...that's where the depth comes in.

1607
01:23:54,530 --> 01:23:56,589
你怎么不告诉我们 她如此有深度
Why didn't you ever tell us that she gets it?

1608
01:23:56,766 --> 01:23:58,256
对 你瞒着我们呢
Yeah, you were holding out.

1609
01:23:58,434 --> 01:24:00,698
我一直在努力告诉你们
That's what I've been trying to tell you guys.

1610
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:03,202
棒极了 宝贝 棒极了
That was beautiful, honey. That was beautiful.

1611
01:24:06,242 --> 01:24:07,607
一起拥抱吧
Group hug.

1612
01:24:36,872 --> 01:24:38,271
好了 就在这
Okay, it's in position.

1613
01:24:38,441 --> 01:24:40,341

It'll be fun. I spent all morning blowing that thing up.

1615
01:24:43,446 --> 01:24:44,743
你应该会没事的
You should be all right.

1616
01:24:44,914 --> 01:24:47,405
- 应该? - 嗯
- Should be? - Yeah.

1617
01:24:48,951 --> 01:24:50,578
准备好没?
Ready?

1618
01:24:51,120 --> 01:24:52,553
跳
Go.

1619
01:25:00,396 --> 01:25:02,091
哥还要再爽一下!
Let's do that again.

1620
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:05,290
这不只是小忙 这可是为我投资
It's not a favor. It's like a great investment for me, man.

1621
01:25:05,468 --> 01:25:06,958
汽车美容中心
A car detailing center.

1622
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:09,400
周围仅此一家 肯定财源广进
And there's none around, it's gonna be a goldmine.

1623
01:25:09,572 --> 01:25:11,130
我不想要你的钱
I don't wanna take your money.

1624
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:14,174
- 你在帮我赚钱 - 我也加入 行不？
- You're making me more. - I want in, okay?

1625
01:25:14,343 --> 01:25:17,278
我认识凯尔特人队的老板 我能拿下他
I know the owner of the Celtics. And I can get us that account.

1626
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:19,812
那些家伙可都是开宾利和法拉利的
Those guys all drive Bentleys and Ferraris.

1627
01:25:19,982 --> 01:25:21,506
你怎么认识凯尔特人的老板的?
How do you know the owner of the Celtics?

1628
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:24,278
我是他女儿所在童子军的掌门人
Hey, I'm the leader of his daughter's Girl Scout troop.

1629
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:27,183
如果他关心女儿的Cookie Biz奖章
If he wants to make sure she gets her Cookie Biz badge...

1630
01:25:27,356 --> 01:25:28,846

Yeah. They're afraid of us. That's what it is.

1653
