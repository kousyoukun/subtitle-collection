1
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,394
Double dribble.

2
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:10,263
Why, because I'm black?

3
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:12,337
Yeah, that's what I thought.

4
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:35,424
<i>Me?</i>

5
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,187
Ten seconds left.
We need a basket.

6
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:40,957
Play one. Play one.

7
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,459
Kurt, Kurt, Kurt. Here.

8
00:01:43,636 --> 00:01:45,263
Get in.

9
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,333
Bring it in!

10
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,999
Bank's open, Lenny.

11
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,508
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,112
Yeah.

13
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,975
Bank's open.

14
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,481
His foot was on the line.

15
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:09,461
First off, I'd like to thank
the Earnshaw family...

16
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,224
...for lending us their beautiful lake
house to help us celebrate our victory.

17
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:15,333
Yeah, the Ferdinando Five.

18
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,664
They're dynamite.

19
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:19,998
You're drunk, Dad.

20
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:22,198
Yeah.

21
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:26,573
Hey. We're here to celebrate
the kids' shots, not your shots.

22
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:32,182
Anyway, I wanna talk about
what you kids did this afternoon.

23
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:36,550
You know, you played the game
just like I always ask you to.

24
00:02:36,723 --> 00:02:39,419
You left everything you had
out there on that court.

25
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,757
So that when the final buzzer
went off...

26
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,395
...you were champions.

27
00:02:45,565 --> 00:02:47,692
Now, I want you
to promise me something.

28
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:51,598
I want you to play life
just like you played that game today.

29
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,435
So when that final buzzer of life
goes off...

30
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:00,837
...you'll have no regrets.

31
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:02,575
Here's to coach.

32
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:13,017
You're my first champions.
My first champions.

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,216
Stick together.

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,128
<i>- Time to die.</i>
<i>- No.</i>

35
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,124
<i>Murder.</i>

36
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,896
I am the biggest agent in Hollywood
and you just pissed me off.

37
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,403
And now I'll pull Brad Pitt
from your movie.

38
00:03:27,574 --> 00:03:31,010
I'll pull Julia Roberts from your movie.
I don't care, Sandy.

39
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:33,304
That's right, you better back down.

40
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:34,904
Thank you.

41
00:03:35,081 --> 00:03:37,481
Have a good Fourth of July.
All right, love you too.

42
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,880
What's up, boys? Hey.

43
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:42,150
Greggie, Keithie.

44
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,484
You guys ever hear of a game called
Chutes and Ladders?

45
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,718
Pretty awesome game.

46
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,522
I used to play it when I was a kid.

47
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:53,598
Okay, what it is,
is they give you a spinner.

48
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:57,099
And you spin. If you land on a ladder,
you get to climb up the ladder.

49
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,671
If you land on a chute, you slide down
the chute and start over again.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,775
Yeah, and what happens?
The winner gets a training bra?

51
00:04:03,943 --> 00:04:06,343
Yeah, Dad,
that game sounds like it sucks.

52
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:08,503
I'm telling you,
this was the greatest game.

53
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,239
Me and my buddies would play it.

54
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,782
We'd go down in the basement,
drink hot chocolate.

55
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,852
I wouldn't mind
a hot chocolate right now.

56
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,314
Hey, Rita.

57
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,014
Rita.

58
00:04:19,192 --> 00:04:21,683
Dude, you gotta text her.
She's doing laundry.

59
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:25,124
Hey, Dad, we were at
the Spielbergs' house yesterday.

60
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,324
They have a 150-inch TV.
Can we get one of those?

61
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,061
When you direct <i>E. T.</i>
I'll get you one of those.

62
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:34,172
<i>- Beg for mercy.</i>
- What is the object here? I don't get it.

63
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,436
You're on a cruise ship and you chop
people's heads off with a chain saw?

64
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,306
Oh, and you can drown them.

65
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,311
Oh, you can drown them.
Now I get it.

66
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,140
<i>Granny overboard.</i>

67
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,452
Can somebody answer the phone?

68
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,616
Maybe I should get some chamomile
for my throat too.

69
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,315
Stop texting the nanny.
You know how gross that is...

70
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:56,121
...for a kid to text his nanny?
Just go down the hallway.

71
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,661
Why? You text everybody.

72
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,823
I text people for my job so I can make
money to pay for your texting.

73
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:05,664
- Okay, I got everything for you, boys.
- Who was that on the phone, Rita?

74
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,864
I'm sorry, Mr. Feder, I don't know.
Becky answered.

75
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:11,909
- Okay, okay. Thanks for making that.
- Oh, my God, Rita.

76
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:14,706
This isn't Godiva. What are you,
trying to poison me?

77
00:05:15,515 --> 00:05:16,914
Good Lord, go back to texting.

78
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:19,711
I don't ever wanna hear that
out loud again.

79
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,820
What the heck's going on out here?

80
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:27,385
Oh, my God.

81
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,191
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.

82
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:34,231
I don't care. Are you all right?
What the heck were you doing?

83
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,493
I was trying to use the Navy.

84
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,034
The Navy? What's the Navy?

85
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,672
The Navy in the car
to ask it a question.

86
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,502
You mean
the navigation system, idiot.

87
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,507
- Keithie, relax.
- Some man called.

88
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,943
He said your friend, Coach Buzzer,
went to heaven.

89
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:52,312
I was trying to find heaven for you
on the Navy station...

90
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,112
...so you could go visit him.

91
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,554
Who's your friend, Dad?

92
00:06:02,995 --> 00:06:07,193
Coach Buzzer was someone
very special in Daddy's life.

93
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,426
It's terrible.

94
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:12,332
Okay, go drink some hot chocolate
with these guys.

95
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,840
You sure you're okay?

96
00:06:17,143 --> 00:06:19,043
Okay, sweetie.

97
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,611
You're splashing your brother.

98
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:23,044
Eric, hon? It's your mom.

99
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:32,648
Oh, my God. Eric.
Are you all right?

100
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,824
Donna.

101
00:06:35,528 --> 00:06:38,622
Oh, my God, Bean.
Bean, stay on the duck.

102
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,266
Stay on the duck.
What is happening?

103
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,459
Oh, hon.

104
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:44,827
Hello, Mommy.

105
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,228
- Hey.
- Hey, Mom.

106
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,430
Hi, Mom.

107
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,734
Well, I'll see you there. All right.

108
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,103
Hey, is something wrong?

109
00:06:51,277 --> 00:06:53,973
Yeah, it'll be all right.
I'll talk to you about it later.

110
00:06:54,547 --> 00:06:55,809
Hey, hey.

111
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:57,847
I made the pumpkin risotto
that we saw...

112
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,247
...on Rachael Ray's
"Seasons of Summer" special.

113
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,786
- It's awful, Mom.
- It tastes like roadkill.

114
00:07:02,955 --> 00:07:05,651
Deanne, do you hear how they talk
to me? Do you hear how...?

115
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:06,917
You gotta say something.

116
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,085
All right, kids. Now, you know
your father works very hard...

117
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,630
...at keeping this house clean
and putting meals on the table for us.

118
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,267
Hello?

119
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,369
Besides...

120
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:21,102
...I brought us a pizza.

121
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:24,134
You know what? Fine.

122
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,244
Have your pizza. Have your pizza.

123
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,606
You broke my heart.

124
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,805
You broke my heart.

125
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:34,152
Looks like
it's his time of the month again.

126
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,754
God, that's rough, buddy.

127
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,816
Who's making
the funeral arrangements?

128
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:44,520
Oh, his niece?
She must be devastated.

129
00:07:44,697 --> 00:07:46,790
Hey, is she still hot, do you know?

130
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,230
Don't make me lose my temper,
Marcus.

131
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,571
What?

132
00:07:54,941 --> 00:07:58,377
Hey, if I don't make it
to the funeral...

133
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:02,342
...tell the police it was Arlene
from Applebee's.

134
00:08:03,049 --> 00:08:04,846
No, thanks for calling me.

135
00:08:05,017 --> 00:08:06,746
And I'll see you there.

136
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:09,145
Bye.

137
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,449
The coach is dead.

138
00:08:15,962 --> 00:08:18,226
His funeral is this Friday.

139
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:22,960
I don't think I can handle this alone.

140
00:08:23,269 --> 00:08:24,702
Can you come with me?

141
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,299
Of course.

142
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:30,499
I'll postpone my cataract surgery.

143
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:32,906
You are my special lady.

144
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:38,179
Now I'm gonna transport you
to a world of serene relaxation.

145
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,596
Okay, guys,
let's try to act normal in there.

146
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,364
What's wrong
with your sunglasses?

147
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,634
I don't want any reason
for these guys to call me...

148
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,640
Hollywood!

149
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,539
- Hey. Look at that. Kurt McKenzie.
- Hey.

150
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,309
- And the whole McKenzie clan.
- Come here, man.

151
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,350
- Deanne, you look great.
- I do?

152
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,148
My wife's over there.
Go and say hi. Children.

153
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:19,382
I see that ass is still growing.

154
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,925
Got a little Kardashian in there.

155
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:26,690
Well, you've kind of turned into a little
Michael Vick thing, if he was bulimic.

156
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,394
Hi, Roxanne.

157
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:32,094
I don't know if you remember me.
I was at your wedding.

158
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:35,536
I was the one that was table dancing
all night. Deanne McKenzie.

159
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,902
Of course.

160
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,601
- Deanne, hello.
- Hi, good to see you.

161
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,144
Oh, my God, you're glowing.

162
00:09:41,347 --> 00:09:44,441
You look so beautiful
with your pregnancy.

163
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,783
What the hell are you talking about?

164
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,090
I'm just playing.

165
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,660
Oh, my God. You should see
your face. You were like, "Huh?"

166
00:09:57,496 --> 00:09:59,589
Little Lenny Feder.

167
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,164
Mama Ronzoni got big, huh?

168
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,733
Look at this handsome hunk
of prosciutto.

169
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,269
And such a big success.

170
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,669
Come on, give Mama a kiss.

171
00:10:10,843 --> 00:10:13,073
Can I get a...?
Can I get a cheek at all?

172
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:17,409
I got you, I got you. Poked in the eye
by the hat, but I'm all right.

173
00:10:18,217 --> 00:10:21,709
How about your son-in-law here,
I hear he's a house husband now.

174
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:24,754
My daughter's gotta bust her hump
all day to pay the bills...

175
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,051
...while dummy here stays home
and cleans.

176
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:29,490
I don't know how you could
talk to me like that...

177
00:10:29,662 --> 00:10:32,631
...when you look like Idi Amin
with a propeller on your head.

178
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,460
- That's nice that he could...
- Roxanne, this is my mother.

179
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:40,163
Hello, Mama Ronzoni, I'm so pleased
to meet you. I'm Little Lenny's wife.

180
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:44,173
What a spicy quesadilla
you got yourself, Lenny.

181
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,402
Yeah, she tastes great.

182
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,738
I bet.

183
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,185
Didn't I tell you
to turn the phone off there, Greg?

184
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:56,048
Yeah, but it's my massage therapist.

185
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:58,486
What? No, no. No cell phones.

186
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,319
No cell phones?
Then I'm out of here.

187
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:01,818
Higgie.

188
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,656
Who's ready to get their funeral on?

189
00:11:05,965 --> 00:11:07,728
I'm sorry, death makes me weird.

190
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,367
What's up, McKenzie?

191
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:11,765
You got those soft hands.
Still using Palmolive?

192
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,199
Hey, what's up, Lenny?

193
00:11:13,372 --> 00:11:15,636
Buddy, I thought you were gonna start
working out.

194
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,935
- What does that mean?
- You're fat.

195
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,202
No. No.

196
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:22,279
Hey, guys, this is good news.
I always wanted to represent you.

197
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,279
You're the third Olsen twin?

198
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,509
Keep it down.
Hey, so these are your kids?

199
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:29,614
And who's that girl?
That's not a nanny, is it?

200
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,885
No, no, this is a friend of ours
from China.

201
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,960
Oh, yeah.
No, I've been on that website.

202
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:37,152
No, no, no.

203
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:41,925
Like an exchange student that...
My wife brought her into the house.

204
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,467
Oh, your wife's into chicks.
Oh, that's nice.

205
00:11:44,637 --> 00:11:46,468
Hollywood. See, he always lucks out.

206
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,937
- Just an exchange student.
- I always thought...

207
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:50,541
Hey, now.

208
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:54,544
Lamonsoff. Rolling up in a Caddy?

209
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:55,738
That's how we do it.

210
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:59,282
And you, you've grown up
on me, man. Are you a B-cup now?

211
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,954
Hey, nice ears.
You get the NFL package on those?

212
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:08,084
Nice Caddy.
You selling lawn furniture and crack?

213
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,093
Come on, I'm the co-owner
of Branchville Lawn Furniture, man.

214
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:12,560
I'm the boss now, baby.

215
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,926
Oh, good for you, Eric.

216
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,591
- Glad you brought your mother.
- Oh, that's a good one.

217
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:20,136
It's like shaking hands with an Eagle.
I'll see you later.

218
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:26,135
Oh, my God. It's Captain Caring
of the <i>SS Melodrama.</i>

219
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,303
Oh, he's gonna play this one big.

220
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,971
Cue "Hey."

221
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,508
Hey.

222
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,117
Hey.

223
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:35,845
- Hell of a circumstance, huh?
- I know, I know. It sucks.

224
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:37,045
Great to see you.

225
00:12:37,223 --> 00:12:39,783
Well, the Buzzer's up there
coaching heaven's team now.

226
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:43,986
- That's true.
- He's got Wilt, Pistol Pete, Dr. J.

227
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:46,427
Yeah, Dr. J's alive still.

228
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:49,197
- Well, those type of guys.
- Yeah, yeah.

229
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,630
You look good, though, man.

230
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,533
It's like if Elvis
was an Oompa Loompa...

231
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:55,401
...he's right in front of me.

232
00:12:55,574 --> 00:12:58,634
Well, I don't make jokes at funerals
because it's disrespectful.

233
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:01,746
But if that's part of
your healing process, I'm cool with it.

234
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:03,279
That's nice. Thanks.

235
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,383
Are you cool with a finger in you?

236
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,614
Hey, Roxanne.

237
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:13,088
Remember Rob,
the guy I always tell you about? Rob?

238
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,419
Of course.

239
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:18,051
The kid who didn't hit puberty
till he was 19, right?

240
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,159
That was our secret.

241
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,631
And this must be your mother.

242
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,160
My wife.

243
00:13:25,871 --> 00:13:26,997
I'm sorry.

244
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,300
Hi. I'm Gloria.

245
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,808
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Your design line is so beautiful.

246
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,844
Oh, thank you, thank you.

247
00:13:36,015 --> 00:13:38,074
- And I love your scarves.
- Thank you.

248
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,479
She'll be tying me up
with those later.

249
00:13:43,189 --> 00:13:45,214
He's not kidding.

250
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,860
Oh, grody.

251
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:52,486
Oh, those are long, long tongues.

252
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:58,128
We'll see you in there.
See you in there.

253
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,705
Hi, guys. Right over there? Yep.

254
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:05,844
Sit right here, sit right here.
I'm gonna go say hi to Lenny.

255
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,172
- No, honey.
- Oh, hi. Lenny.

256
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:09,939
How you doing?

257
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:12,345
I heard through a little bird...

258
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:15,544
...that you guys rented
the Earnshaw lake house for us...

259
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,915
...for the entire weekend.

260
00:14:17,089 --> 00:14:18,818
That's like a dream come true
for us.

261
00:14:18,991 --> 00:14:21,016
We had to rent it
for the whole weekend be...

262
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:24,094
We don't get to stay the whole
weekend. We have to go to Milan.

263
00:14:24,263 --> 00:14:26,060
For Roxanne's fashion show.

264
00:14:26,232 --> 00:14:27,699
Oh, my God, that's a shame.

265
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:30,097
Oh, but you're gonna have
so much fun in Milan.

266
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:33,238
You know, J Lo and Marc Anthony
vacationed there last year.

267
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:36,568
It's up the street from Lake Como,
where George Clooney has a villa.

268
00:14:36,742 --> 00:14:38,642
I read too many of those magazines.

269
00:14:38,811 --> 00:14:40,142
- No.
- Come on. I'm sorry.

270
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,439
- He hates when I talk about this.
- We'll just...

271
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:44,879
We are backing away.
Ashamed, right?

272
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,814
Oh, and Tom Cruise
got married there too.

273
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,151
- Thanks for letting me know.
- What?

274
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:53,450
Well, I don't understand why you had
to rent it for a whole weekend.

275
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:57,153
Because it's a holiday.
They won't rent it to you for one night.

276
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:00,628
So your friends are partying all
weekend while you're stuck in Milan.

277
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,096
- Yeah.
- That was nice of you.

278
00:15:02,268 --> 00:15:04,532
It was nice of us.
It's your money too, isn't it?

279
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,570
Yeah, it's your money, it's his money,
it's my money.

280
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:10,173
Let's put all our cash in a pile
and split it.

281
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,867
That's a nice hat,
it brings out the death in the room.

282
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,310
I'm sorry, I'm nervous.
And it's a funeral, I get weird.

283
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,520
There he is, Joe Hollywood.

284
00:15:22,688 --> 00:15:24,781
Mr. Big Shot Agent.

285
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:27,892
You think he represents
Hulk Hogan?

286
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,093
No way.

287
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,053
Then he ain't that big, is he?

288
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:37,859
By the way, if anyone asks,
Rita is an exchange student.

289
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,504
Andre.

290
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,111
I think I just sat
on your adding machine.

291
00:15:47,713 --> 00:15:50,682
Now I know what happened
to the fish tank.

292
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:54,281
Coach Robert "The Buzzer"
Ferdinando...

293
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,387
...was a caretaker by profession.

294
00:15:56,555 --> 00:16:01,015
What a wonderful word to describe
his devotion to his fellow man.

295
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,627
He truly took care.

296
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,322
When Robert knew
that his time was short...

297
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:09,023
...he told me there was
one specific man he wanted...

298
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,465
...to say a few words
to memorialize him.

299
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:15,038
So I'd like to ask Lenny Feder
to come up now.

300
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,712
I'm sorry, I'm not prepared at all.

301
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,284
I feel very honored...

302
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,313
...that coach asked me
to do this, but...

303
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:37,458
I also feel terrible because
I haven't seen the coach in so long.

304
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:41,087
And he always wanted me to come
to town and see him...

305
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:45,100
...and I got caught up
in what I've been doing and I regret it.

306
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:48,931
I understand that the St. Mark's team
of 1978...

307
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:53,044
...was the only championship team
that the coach ever had...

308
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,747
...and that's very impressive,
I gotta say...

309
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,611
...judging from the talent
we had to offer.

310
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:01,616
I mean, believe it or not...

311
00:17:01,787 --> 00:17:06,281
...Robbie and Marcus were actually
shorter back in 1978.

312
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,352
But those guys had a skill
you never mastered.

313
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,723
They knew how to pass the ball.

314
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:16,864
Looks like somebody has to learn how
to pass the Kentucky Fried Chicken.

315
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,902
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

316
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:23,303
We're saying goodbye to a big part
of our lives. All of us.

317
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:27,605
You affected everybody in this room.

318
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,311
And I hope we get
to live our lives like you.

319
00:17:32,951 --> 00:17:38,787
Have no regrets
when life's final buzzer sounds.

320
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,990
So let's all bow our heads in silence.

321
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,475
They should have just ended it
right after you.

322
00:17:58,644 --> 00:18:00,305
This is insanity.

323
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,707
Yeah.

324
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,642
Five bucks it takes him down
on one knee.

325
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,575
You're on.

326
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,755
<i>Stop it.</i>

327
00:18:53,899 --> 00:18:55,059
Grow up, will you?

328
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,633
Oh, look at him now.

329
00:18:57,436 --> 00:19:00,337
Don't get so mad there, Robbie.

330
00:19:02,241 --> 00:19:05,142
So how we feeling about Rob's girl?
We're happy for him, or...?

331
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:08,040
Oh, my God. The St. Pauli Grandma?
She seems all right.

332
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:09,578
She's pretty.

333
00:19:09,748 --> 00:19:11,613
You know,
in a "me in a wig" sort of way.

334
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,182
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

335
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,879
When Ben Franklin was flying that kite
and it had the key on it...

336
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,991
...that was to her apartment.

337
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,025
Oh, that was good, man.

338
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:27,564
You know, but I gotta say,
he seems like he's in love, you know?

339
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,758
He was in love
with the first three wives.

340
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,664
The Cheater, the Beater
and the Eater.

341
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:35,273
You know, his problem is he's always
so overly in love so quick, you know?

342
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,568
And then one day he snaps
and then it gets ugly in a hurry.

343
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:40,109
Coffee, Mr. Feder?

344
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:41,906
No, no, no. I'm good, I'm good.

345
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,675
I mean, thank you. That's cool of you
to voluntarily wanna give me coffee.

346
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,981
Just, you drink it, you know, while
you're studying inside the church.

347
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,181
But you texted me you want coffee.

348
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,190
I texted you that I wanted you
to drink the coffee and study.

349
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,760
So study your books in the church.

350
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,228
Go ahead. All right, Rita.

351
00:20:00,399 --> 00:20:02,128
Fast food? You guys eat the fast...?

352
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,436
Mommy, I want some milk.

353
00:20:08,607 --> 00:20:13,237
Oh, sure, angel. You come here.
I'll give you a little something.

354
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,171
Slow down, honey.
Not such big gulps.

355
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,078
You're gonna get a tummy ache.

356
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,549
- Your son is so cute.
- Yeah.

357
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:24,746
How old is he?

358
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,624
Oh, he's 48 months.

359
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:30,261
That's 4.

360
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:31,854
Yeah.

361
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:35,124
We meant to stop last year,
but he likes it so much...

362
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,598
...and we don't like to say no.

363
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,464
Hey, sweetheart?

364
00:20:39,638 --> 00:20:41,663
Could you use a fork, please?

365
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,966
No.

366
00:20:43,141 --> 00:20:47,339
No, no, no!

367
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:49,571
Looks like she didn't get the memo.

368
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,267
- Hey. Let me get that spot.
- Hey, gotta respect the Caddy.

369
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:17,799
It's nice you drove
your piggy bank here.

370
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:19,443
- Hey.
- Hey.

371
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,873
Hey. Hi, Gloria.

372
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,104
- Look at this.
- Come on.

373
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,339
Yeah.

374
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,642
Hey, Rob's car
is an Oompa Loompa too.

375
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:29,116
- Okay, watch the edge.
- It's cute. It'll do for one night.

376
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,687
Yeah? You can handle it?

377
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,450
Daddy, what is that machine doing?

378
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:36,526
It's getting rid of the moths, honey.

379
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,162
Where's it taking them?

380
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,888
- Hell.
- Don't say that, Higgins.

381
00:21:40,098 --> 00:21:41,531
I'm sorry. Not hell, Mexico.

382
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,568
No, it's giving them electricity...

383
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:48,729
...so the moths fall asleep
electrically.

384
00:21:48,907 --> 00:21:50,340
It's electrocuting them?

385
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,340
- No, no, no.
- But, Daddy, they're dying.

386
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:53,876
- It's killing them?
- No.

387
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:55,871
Daddy, no.

388
00:21:56,048 --> 00:21:57,208
No, no, it's not.

389
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,145
Okay? Let me adjust it.

390
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,651
Look, they're all all right,
I promise you.

391
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,085
See? Look at this guy.

392
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,718
He's still sleeping.

393
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,826
It's dead, Dad.

394
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:11,052
A porch swing.

395
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,595
I know what I'm doing this weekend.

396
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,192
Now he's dead.

397
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,362
Welcome back to 1978, everybody.
The lake house.

398
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:23,840
Nothing's changed,
it's unbelievable.

399
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,943
I don't remember this big.

400
00:22:26,111 --> 00:22:28,739
This is my kitchen.
This is it, right now.

401
00:22:28,914 --> 00:22:30,745
Oh, please, enough with the kitchen.

402
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:32,042
Why you so mean?

403
00:22:32,217 --> 00:22:33,548
We could've done this.

404
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:36,051
- An organ.
- Oh, my God, look at this kitchen.

405
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:38,689
- That's enough, already.
- Could you at least humor me?

406
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,688
Is this like
an Outward Bound thing?

407
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,759
I mean, it's like an episode of <i>Lost</i>.

408
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,693
Hon, you might not
wanna bang on that.

409
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,593
But I like playing it like this.

410
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:49,233
Okay. Okay.

411
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,460
So listen, guys,
who's getting what room?

412
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,104
Actually, I made a map
of who gets which room.

413
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:57,070
I took the liberty of reserving
the room with the waterbed...

414
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,971
...for Gloria and myself.

415
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:03,112
You're gonna do
the backstroke tonight.

416
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,306
I wanna go swimming
with you guys tonight.

417
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:08,749
Oh, honey, we're not really going
swimming. What I meant was...

418
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,320
That's okay. She doesn't
need to know what you mean.

419
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,789
- I don't even know what you mean.
- Oh, I know what she meant.

420
00:23:15,327 --> 00:23:17,295
Anyway, let's get back
to the room picking.

421
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,657
Rob, would you like
to take us on a tour?

422
00:23:19,831 --> 00:23:22,732
I'd love to show you a tour.
Gloria was just trying to be cool.

423
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,493
I need someplace near a bathroom.

424
00:23:24,669 --> 00:23:26,967
Why does the grandma
get to go swimming and I don't?

425
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,766
Let's go, let's go.

426
00:23:29,641 --> 00:23:31,575
Okay, here's the big daddy.

427
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,971
The master bedroom.

428
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:36,478
You know what? Lenny should
have that. Lenny should have that.

429
00:23:36,648 --> 00:23:37,842
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I agree.

430
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:40,109
Honey. Honey.
Come on, let the kids have it.

431
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:43,982
It's a fun time for the kids to be
together and they can do kids' things.

432
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,351
Come on, go share it.
Share the master bedroom.

433
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,958
Kids win.

434
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,423
Yeah. Yeah. Don't you think?

435
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:51,853
Yeah, okay.

436
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,725
- Cool.
- Cool.

437
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:57,767
Hey, Dad.

438
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:01,133
What's the big box attached
to the back of the TV?

439
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,297
That's the rest of the TV.

440
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,966
They didn't always have
flat screens there, sport.

441
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,046
Wow, that is some
Stone Age shiznit.

442
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,207
- Yeah, that's wack.
- I need a room with heat.

443
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:15,876
It's summer.
It's like 95 degrees in here.

444
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,013
There he goes again.

445
00:24:18,190 --> 00:24:19,714
I got bunions.

446
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,951
You know, I actually have a poultice
I make, using maize and herbs.

447
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,028
Just say corn.
Maize is corn, everybody.

448
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,722
Yeah, he says maize
because it sounds more mystical.

449
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,527
Well, I like the way he said it.
"Maize."

450
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:32,294
- "Maize."
- "Maize."

451
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,336
- "Maize."
- "Maize."

452
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:37,600
- It's fantastic, okay?
- It's a-maize-ing.

453
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:41,207
I just spread it on cloth
and I moisten and heat it...

454
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,973
...and then I apply it directly
to the affected area.

455
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:50,088
Okay. Well, my affected area
is pretty big.

456
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:51,722
Oh, no.

457
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:56,350
Mama, I didn't know
the Elephant Man lived in your shoe.

458
00:24:56,528 --> 00:24:59,088
How in the world's anybody supposed
to get some sleep...

459
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,165
...knowing they under the same roof as
Toe-be Bryant over here?

460
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,504
You're stepping over the line,
woman.

461
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:14,204
So, what's with that Labradoodle?
It sounds like Stephen Hawking.

462
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,041
Curly, he had
his vocal cords clipped.

463
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:19,115
A neighbor filed a complaint...

464
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:23,378
...so it was either clip the cords
or put Curly down.

465
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,716
Wrong choice.

466
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,554
Come on, he's part of the family,
you know?

467
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:33,357
Imagine when a burglar comes over
and hears that. He must run in terror.

468
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,591
"Wow, what's that turkey
doing in the house?"

469
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:38,726
By the way, Lamonsoff, your son.

470
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:41,429
What's with the boob thing?
Isn't the kid a little old?

471
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,870
He'll be rubbing her boob
with his beard soon.

472
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,705
He's gonna get a milk mustache on a
real mustache. That won't look right.

473
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,938
That kid, when he's 10, on his bike...

474
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,107
...the mom's gonna be in the basket,
he's gonna be like:

475
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:58,146
- Come on.
- Okay, wait, I got this one.

476
00:25:58,323 --> 00:25:59,722
<i>Chain saw pedicure, 50 points.</i>

477
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,359
Why are they inside right now,
anyways?

478
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,995
Why would they not come out here
and enjoy the lake...

479
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:06,630
...or do something in the woods?

480
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,164
There wasn't a time of day
that I wasn't outside.

481
00:26:09,367 --> 00:26:12,234
You know, we weren't.
We were always... We were never in.

482
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,133
<i>All heads on deck!</i>

483
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,171
Look, there's blood
squirting everywhere!

484
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:18,935
- I can't take it anymore.
- Chop his arms off.

485
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,941
Oh, he's being a dad. Look at this.

486
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,411
Dad. Don't, Dad. My high score.

487
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:29,680
That's it. No more video games.
No more cell phones. No more texting.

488
00:26:29,854 --> 00:26:33,187
Just from now on, while we're here,
stay outside and play.

489
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:34,655
What are we supposed to do?

490
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:39,160
Just play like normal kids.
Come on, move it. Where's Becky?

491
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:42,133
Let's go. Let me show you
how the Pilgrims used to hang.

492
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:46,603
When we were kids, your dad used to
talk us into doing the craziest stuff.

493
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,795
That's right.

494
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:51,033
Yeah, I remember one time,
we got our shower curtains...

495
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:54,337
...put them in shopping carts and went
shopping cart sailing.

496
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:55,638
Wait, how did you steer?

497
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,782
- Well, we didn't.
- How'd you stop?

498
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,509
You just smashed into something.
That was the fun part.

499
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:02,619
We used to shoot bottle rockets
at each other.

500
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,312
You go for the guy's face
because you wanna blind him.

501
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,151
Okay, no, that's a little much, pal.

502
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,691
No. No, I know. Kids, don't do that.

503
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:12,728
You know what, erase, reboot.

504
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:16,560
Okay. Look, look.
Make a tree fort. I'll get you started.

505
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,669
Rob lived in one of those for a year.

506
00:27:18,837 --> 00:27:20,429
Why?

507
00:27:20,605 --> 00:27:22,630
My dad took away my roller skates.

508
00:27:23,241 --> 00:27:25,141
Vietnam flashback.

509
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,237
Wait a minute. Are you kidding me?

510
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:30,175
- What?
- What?

511
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:32,007
Nice.

512
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,310
Rope on a tree, baby.
You know what that means.

513
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,817
We get to hang ourselves?

514
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,684
You see a rope and a lake and that
doesn't make you wanna go nuts?

515
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,325
It makes me... You know what?

516
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,518
You know what, let me show them.

517
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:44,821
- Yeah.
- Yeah, baby.

518
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,395
Dude, get up on the top rock.

519
00:27:46,564 --> 00:27:49,089
- Yeah, you're right.
- You gotta back it up, back it up.

520
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:50,359
Go, baby.

521
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,867
The class is in session.

522
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:55,029
Who wants to see a double flip?

523
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,165
Too high.

524
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,276
- Now drop.
- This was a mistake.

525
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:01,602
I can't let go, I'm too scared.

526
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:11,915
That was awesome.

527
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,184
Oh, God. Oh, God, my leg's snapped.

528
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,692
Oh, my God, the bone's sticking out.
I need help.

529
00:28:18,163 --> 00:28:21,599
It's a stick. I got you.

530
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,260
Very good.

531
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,700
Daddy, that bird is hurt.

532
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,404
Oh, my God. I'll go get a shoebox.

533
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:34,108
Here you go.

534
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,679
Hey, did you really land
on that bird, man?

535
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:37,872
I'm not sure.

536
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,951
I did hear a chirp and a crunch-like
noise, but that could've been anything.

537
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,722
Okay.

538
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,954
Keith. Sit down. Sit down.

539
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,458
Dad, I wanna sit next to you.

540
00:28:50,628 --> 00:28:53,392
Daddy's gonna be down here with
his friends first and then...

541
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,433
Lenny, remember we used to come
here late night after we got wasted?

542
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,295
What's "wasted"?

543
00:29:00,805 --> 00:29:02,067
Nice one, Higgie.

544
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,936
"Wasted." kids...

545
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,806
...is something that happens...

546
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,004
...when you have a hankering
for ice cream.

547
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:11,876
- I wanna get wasted.
- I wanna get wasted.

548
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,415
I wanna get wasted every day.

549
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,576
I wanna get chocolate wasted.

550
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,086
No, you don't need to get wasted,
it's okay.

551
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,816
All right, you know what,
let me make this easy.

552
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:24,325
Seventeen burgers
and 17 fries, okay?

553
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:28,296
And that'll be just for me.
What are you guys having?

554
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,224
Lamonsoff.

555
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:31,527
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

556
00:29:31,703 --> 00:29:33,694
That's for everybody.
Just put it on that.

557
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,137
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- I am not gonna have any hamburgers.

558
00:29:37,308 --> 00:29:40,209
I'll take some meat loaf,
some calzones...

559
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,279
...but put the marinara sauce
on the side.

560
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:46,349
With corn, either on the cob
or whatever you got.

561
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,850
- Are you going to the electric chair?
- What?

562
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,988
No, he was just kidding, Henry VIII.

563
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:55,955
She's eating for two:
her and Toe-bo Cop.

564
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,554
But, Mama, they do have bunion rings
if you want some.

565
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,130
That was good, Lenny.

566
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,561
How about some drinks?

567
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,168
I said I'm paying,
so take it easy with that, okay?

568
00:30:05,336 --> 00:30:08,203
I'm kidding, everybody. I'm kidding.
We can drink all we want.

569
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:10,238
I'll start it off.
I'm gonna have a Coke.

570
00:30:10,408 --> 00:30:14,708
And I know Donna, she's gonna want
a Sprite, correct, sweetie? And...

571
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,205
Bean's good with milk, obviously.

572
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:19,708
I want cookies.

573
00:30:19,884 --> 00:30:21,215
Cookies and MILF.

574
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,251
MILF? Oh, Higgins,
thank you so much.

575
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,254
Take it easy, all right?
Hey, tuck it away, sweetie.

576
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:28,415
And I'll take a flat water. Voss.

577
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,051
What?

578
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:32,594
You know, Voss.
Or Fiji, if you don't have Voss.

579
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,823
Yeah, you know,
anything you got's good.

580
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,261
We have out of the faucet.

581
00:30:36,434 --> 00:30:37,731
Like, from a hose?

582
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:38,926
Tap water.

583
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,331
What country's that from?

584
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,997
Oh, my God. Just get the water. We're
done talking about water. Tap water.

585
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,608
I go get the Voss from the b...

586
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:49,508
You just sit down, Rita. Just study
a menu. The big test is coming.

587
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,716
I'm sorry, what now?

588
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,358
He says they have the best burger
in town here.

589
00:31:01,759 --> 00:31:04,956
Really? Since when did you learn
to speak Chinese?

590
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:07,689
It's just something I picked up
watching a cooking show.

591
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,597
That's great. Maybe you should focus
a little less on the talking...

592
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:13,464
...and a little more on the cooking.

593
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,299
Burn.

594
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:17,600
You got told.

595
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,601
You got toe.

596
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:22,371
He comes back.

597
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,745
Mommy, can I have some
of her milk?

598
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,946
There he is.

599
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:29,449
Joe Hollywood.

600
00:31:30,188 --> 00:31:32,554
Who's that? Dickie Bailey?

601
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,884
Oh, my God.

602
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,891
Hey, long time no see.
How you doing, man?

603
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,325
You know, that game
had some bad calls.

604
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:42,393
Now, what game are we talking about?
The game?

605
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,161
What, when we were kids
30 years ago, that game?

606
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:47,167
That last shot?

607
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:50,068
Your foot was on the line.
Shouldn't have counted.

608
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,472
I don't know. I don't remember it
quite like that.

609
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:56,808
You got the rest
of the Fugly Five over there, huh?

610
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:59,049
Yes. Yes. They are.
The boys are here.

611
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,241
Boys?

612
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:03,546
They don't look like they can make it
up and down the court anymore.

613
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:05,916
What about you?
You put on a few pounds?

614
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,614
From when I was 12?

615
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:09,726
Yes, I think so.

616
00:32:09,894 --> 00:32:12,294
You don't know how to come at me,
do you?

617
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:13,487
Rematch. I dare you.

618
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:19,666
In basketball? You don't look like
you're in the greatest shape either.

619
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:23,102
I could see having
a getting-off-the-couch contest, but...

620
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,366
Anytime, anywhere.

621
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:26,942
I was just kidding.
I really don't wanna do that.

622
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,104
Next time you come to town, I'll have
plenty of that Boss water for your kid.

623
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,844
- All right.
- Wouldn't want him to go thirsty.

624
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:38,478
All right, well, just for the record,
it's Voss water, by the way, with a V.

625
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,282
Okay.

626
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:47,156
Gonna be an emotional day tomorrow,
spreading the Buzzer's ashes.

627
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,356
Oh, my God.

628
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:51,764
The coach requested that we
scatter his remains on Mclntyre Island.

629
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,563
I got a beautiful ceremony planned.

630
00:32:53,738 --> 00:32:56,536
Lenny, you gonna be able to do that?
What time do you leave?

631
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:59,443
- What are you talking about?
- What do you mean, leave?

632
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:03,171
I forgot to tell you, fellas.
We gotta take off in the morning.

633
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:05,282
- You're leaving?
- You can't leave.

634
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,419
- We got the ceremony tomorrow.
- Lenny's just playing, everybody.

635
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:09,678
No, he's not.

636
00:33:09,854 --> 00:33:11,014
Are you joking?

637
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:15,057
I wanna be there. I mean, we all wanna
be there. We gotta go to Milan.

638
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,854
Milan, what? Italy? What's in Milan?

639
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,057
It's pretty cool.
Roxanne's got her fall line coming out.

640
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:24,690
- Fashion week.
- Three nights at the Four Seasons.

641
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:26,530
Eggs Benedict by the pool...

642
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,831
...PlayStation 3 in every room...

643
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,567
...and they show boobies
on Italian TV.

644
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:34,400
I'm going to Italy.

645
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,275
No, we all... I didn't tell you guys,
we're probably gonna go to Italy as a...

646
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:40,917
Thanks for ruining the surprise.

647
00:33:41,419 --> 00:33:43,512
Lenny, it's not gonna be the same
without you.

648
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,712
Yeah, come on.

649
00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,017
Roxanne was cool enough to let us
come tonight. This is a big deal.

650
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,786
Can't Roxanne go without you
and you can meet her there?

651
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:55,126
No, we are a team, me and my lady,
and we do everything together.

652
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,860
Last year, we had to skip
Becky's school play for Milan.

653
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:01,200
Roxanne.

654
00:34:01,572 --> 00:34:03,005
Roxanne.

655
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,537
I thought we were
gonna get wasted.

656
00:34:08,246 --> 00:34:10,806
Sweetie. What was I supposed to do,
lie to them?

657
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,917
It's not what you said.
It's how you said it.

658
00:34:14,085 --> 00:34:18,522
I am not some insensitive
work-crazy dragon lady.

659
00:34:18,689 --> 00:34:21,453
And I'm not gonna let you
depict me as one.

660
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:23,617
We are skipping the dinner
in Milan...

661
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:25,193
...spreading the ashes...

662
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,763
...and we're leaving first thing
Sunday morning.

663
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,207
Lamonsoff, it's 5 in the morning.
Can you kill the dog now?

664
00:34:40,445 --> 00:34:41,776
Thinking about it.

665
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,573
Go ahead.
Birdy coming through, everybody.

666
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,808
Hey, morning.

667
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,975
Morning.
Take it right over to the table.

668
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,121
How we doing?
Something stinks in here.

669
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,621
Gloria and I are making breakfast
for everybody.

670
00:34:53,791 --> 00:34:57,784
Using a dehydrator, which never
cooks anything above 115 degrees.

671
00:34:57,962 --> 00:34:59,987
- Those are pancakes?
- Ocean pancakes.

672
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:03,327
They're gray. They look like you
cut them off an elephant's legs.

673
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:05,799
- I'm not eating that.
- It's good for you.

674
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,835
- What is this?
- "What is this?"

675
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,199
A scab?

676
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,635
It's dehydrated banana.

677
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:13,504
What happened to a normal banana?
Peel a banana and eat it.

678
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:16,374
The kids'll love it. It's fun, man.
It doesn't go bad.

679
00:35:16,547 --> 00:35:18,447
- You slice it thin...
- I see what you do.

680
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,277
Maybe you're right. This is good.

681
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,510
- Is that what it's meant for?
- You could.

682
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:26,487
Well, I'd rather be hit by
dehydrated fruit than processed...

683
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:27,681
Processed food.

684
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,726
- I'm just kidding around.
- You think you can just slap people.

685
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:33,887
I don't think that. Don't say that.
Come on.

686
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:35,327
Morning.

687
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,627
Honey, how is the birdy?

688
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:41,570
Those are
the Christian Louboutin shoes.

689
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:42,865
I know I'm overdressed.

690
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,067
But, sorry, I packed for Milan,
not the lake.

691
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,511
Made from acorns.

692
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:53,013
So, dude, I'm not eating any of this.
You got any normal food? Cereal?

693
00:35:53,184 --> 00:35:55,982
Would you like me to make you
egg-white frittata, Mr. Feder?

694
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,350
I mean, is that what you're doing
in science class now?

695
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,349
Making frittatas?

696
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:05,394
No. We're okay. You can go
practice that in your room, though.

697
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,827
I know you got the big test coming.

698
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,432
You know, honey,
I think you're overwhelming Lenny.

699
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:14,070
Here, I got a present for you.

700
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,934
Bacon.

701
00:36:16,107 --> 00:36:17,938
- Knock yourself out.
- Bacon.

702
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:19,433
She gets it.

703
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:22,010
She gets it. She gets it.
Hey, she gets it.

704
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,410
Thank God she gets it.

705
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:26,049
All right, so...

706
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,844
Hey, what are you doing?

707
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:29,610
Cooking the bacon.

708
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:33,245
Not in here. That's dead animal flesh.
It's not going near the vegan food.

709
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,516
Murderer.

710
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:37,183
Fine. What do I do with it?
Oh, I know.

711
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,022
I'm sorry, buddy. I'm sorry.

712
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,992
Curly. Shame on you.

713
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,660
That crazy dog.

714
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:51,035
Must have got into some of my leftover
pasta fasul.

715
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,871
Yeah, Mama, I'm sure
that's exactly what happened.

716
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,205
It did.

717
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:56,971
We should get a dog.

718
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,480
We should get a water buffalo.

719
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,316
Higgins, what are you doing?

720
00:37:03,487 --> 00:37:07,321
I don't wear pants at my house, I'm not
wearing them in your house. Sorry.

721
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,761
That was a man's ass?

722
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:12,523
All right.

723
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,964
Yeah.

724
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:21,231
Let's see this. Look at that.

725
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:29,079
That's it, buddy.

726
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,874
Okay, throw the rock.

727
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,282
Skim it.

728
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,480
Throw it at a tree.

729
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,911
Throw it at the lake.

730
00:37:38,823 --> 00:37:40,757
Throw it at your brother.

731
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,153
Hit your head with it.

732
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,287
Just do something.

733
00:37:47,164 --> 00:37:48,631
Come on.

734
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:52,992
What are you doing dressed like that?
You hanging out with Jiminy Cricket?

735
00:37:53,404 --> 00:37:55,634
We were supposed to be going
to Milan, remember?

736
00:37:55,806 --> 00:37:57,171
That's what I packed for.

737
00:37:57,341 --> 00:37:58,603
Just cut those into shorts.

738
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,971
- We'll play some hoop later.
- Pass, dude.

739
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,545
You don't want revenge
for the time I whupped you?

740
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,181
That was four years ago, homey.

741
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:09,046
All I want is to fly to Milan
and have some fresh-made gelato.

742
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:12,950
What would your father have done
on that one?

743
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,888
That one would've been a backhand
to the side of the head...

744
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,857
...and possible bleeding from the ear.

745
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:21,487
My father would've thrown me down
the stairs for using the word gelato.

746
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:24,895
- You got the new Foreman.
- Yeah.

747
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,129
Hilliard was trying to make me
some tofu Grape-Nuts in there.

748
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:29,364
Try it out.

749
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,667
- You cleaned this?
- Yeah, I cleaned this thing.

750
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:32,934
- Take it.
- Thanks a lot.

751
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,078
By the way,
Mclntyre Island ain't close.

752
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,680
Eat as much as you can,
we got a big row ahead of us.

753
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:40,711
You didn't clean that well.

754
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,554
Come on, man.
What are you doing to me? Seriously.

755
00:38:44,722 --> 00:38:48,055
You don't want your breath to smell
like your grandmother's closet?

756
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,130
Slow down for Robbie, guys.

757
00:39:01,305 --> 00:39:02,533
You're gonna lap me.

758
00:39:03,474 --> 00:39:06,170
Beautiful. You gotta respect
going to Mclntyre Island.

759
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,005
Haven't done that since we're 12.

760
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,840
Got my first boob there.

761
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,278
- I know. Tracy Thornhill.
- Tracy Thorn...

762
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,077
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

763
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,741
A little flat, but I was a fan.

764
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,753
All right, Higgins. Is that all you
think about is chicks?

765
00:39:18,923 --> 00:39:21,323
- We got daughters.
- That's all you guys think about.

766
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:24,723
- Difference is, I can do something.
- Not true. All right, that's true.

767
00:39:24,895 --> 00:39:26,920
You wanna know
what I fantasize about?

768
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:28,122
Candy bars.

769
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,323
Candy bars?

770
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,867
No, I had a bad blood sugar test at
my last checkup and Sally cut me off.

771
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:35,028
You're a grown man,
how do you deal with that?

772
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,800
Oh, I got my own hidden stash,
I'm not stupid.

773
00:39:37,975 --> 00:39:39,237
Seriously, I got it all.

774
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,640
I got Reese's, Butterfingers,
3 Musketeers.

775
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:45,714
I hide them under my clothes
in the bottom of the hamper.

776
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:49,410
It's great because the smell in my
sweat socks mask the chocolate smell.

777
00:39:49,587 --> 00:39:52,317
And the looks of your underwear
masks the chocolate stains.

778
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,050
Hey, hey, hey, hang on, guys.
I gotta make a sissy.

779
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,887
- No, no, no.
- I gotta make a sissy.

780
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:58,426
You made three already.

781
00:39:58,829 --> 00:40:00,797
It must be just oozing out at this point.

782
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,626
Shut up, I'm trying to concentrate.

783
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,893
It's taking a piss, not the SATs.

784
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,807
Are you peeing or is a diesel truck
turning off? What the hell is that?

785
00:40:16,547 --> 00:40:18,276
Listen to hamper bottom.

786
00:40:18,449 --> 00:40:20,815
I think he's sending a message
in Morse code.

787
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,950
Getting old. Stop.

788
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,917
Can't pee. Stop.

789
00:40:25,222 --> 00:40:26,814
Reeks like asparagus. Stop.

790
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:29,084
Even though I didn't even have any.
Stop.

791
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,660
The good news is these girls
are gonna say hi to it.

792
00:40:32,696 --> 00:40:34,687
- What's up, ladies?
- Hey, girls.

793
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,159
- That is so gross-looking.
- Did you see that?

794
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:42,237
- They don't all look like that, ladies.
- You gave that thing 300 pounds...

795
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,498
Come on.

796
00:40:48,512 --> 00:40:50,343
Sick mix tape you made, Robbie.

797
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:54,211
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey, guys, I brought something too.

798
00:40:54,385 --> 00:40:56,478
- Get out of here.
- It's the net, yeah.

799
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,053
Championship game.

800
00:40:58,222 --> 00:41:00,690
- Let me see that.
- I thought the coach should have it.

801
00:41:00,858 --> 00:41:03,292
Robbie, you gotta put this
on the urn, buddy.

802
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,519
That's cool.

803
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:07,253
- "Your foot was on the line."
- Bailey.

804
00:41:07,431 --> 00:41:11,026
What do you think the coach would've
said if he heard that trash-talking?

805
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,067
He'd kick our ass
for not kicking his.

806
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:15,000
- Yeah.
- Or we do it the old-school way.

807
00:41:15,172 --> 00:41:17,538
- Have Eric beat his ass for us.
- I know, we should.

808
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:21,644
No, no, no. I got about eight seconds
of fighting, total, left in my life.

809
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,780
And I'm saving that in case
I get mugged...

810
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:26,849
...or, you know, someone cuts
in front of me at Burger King.

811
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:30,316
- That's my hamper bottom.
- We can't delay it anymore, guys.

812
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:33,582
- He just bit his chicken. All right.
- Are we going? Okay.

813
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:35,122
Let's do it.

814
00:41:35,292 --> 00:41:38,261
You know, I think the coach
is here with us.

815
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:42,388
I think he's proud to be here with us
in ash form.

816
00:41:42,566 --> 00:41:45,296
Right here on this island,
where we hid from our parents...

817
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,937
...and where we're hiding
from our wives and children.

818
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,163
Yes, we are.

819
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:53,870
Goodbye to you...

820
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:56,040
...friend...

821
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:00,681
...wise-advice giver...

822
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:08,792
...buzzer-noise maker.

823
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,099
Rob, come on.

824
00:42:17,268 --> 00:42:19,668
I really messed up my marriages.

825
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,232
All of them.

826
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:23,100
It was my fault, man.

827
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,864
I just couldn't hang on.

828
00:42:25,509 --> 00:42:27,875
You know, my own daughters...

829
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,576
...I don't even hardly know them.

830
00:42:30,981 --> 00:42:33,211
- The Buzzer would be ashamed of me.
- No.

831
00:42:33,384 --> 00:42:34,408
Come on, now.

832
00:42:34,585 --> 00:42:36,985
You got time to patch things up
with your daughters.

833
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,384
You just call them
when you get back.

834
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:43,084
Actually, they're gonna be here
in about 20 minutes.

835
00:42:44,628 --> 00:42:45,993
Wait, what?

836
00:42:46,163 --> 00:42:47,596
I can use a piece of chicken.

837
00:42:48,132 --> 00:42:50,396
No, not with those hands.
Coach hands. All right.

838
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,762
Finish the bucket.

839
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:55,303
Actually, I'm still gonna eat it.
This is pretty sick, but I'm hungry.

840
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,103
Lamonsoff.

841
00:43:05,215 --> 00:43:07,649
Go, old bucket. Drop it.

842
00:43:23,867 --> 00:43:26,233
Piece of crap car.

843
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:28,504
What?

844
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,331
Hey, Dad.

845
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:32,999
Me?

846
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,710
What?

847
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,007
- How do you get that...
- Hey.

848
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:40,377
...from that?

849
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:43,512
Ninety-five percent of that's gotta be
from the mother.

850
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:45,279
And I am lowballing.

851
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,684
Hey, Jasmine.

852
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:48,517
How is that possible?

853
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:50,785
Oh, no. The Elvis hairs
are going up her nose.

854
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,519
She doesn't know what to do.

855
00:43:52,696 --> 00:43:53,720
That's sweet.

856
00:43:53,897 --> 00:43:55,194
Is this your car?

857
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,132
My old man lent me this turd.

858
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,696
Because he doesn't care if I
break down in the middle of nowhere...

859
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:03,499
...and get eaten by a bear.

860
00:44:03,674 --> 00:44:04,971
Your old man?

861
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,906
Yeah, my boyfriend.
Forty-seven years old.

862
00:44:08,078 --> 00:44:10,239
You know,
I wish I liked guys my own age...

863
00:44:10,414 --> 00:44:13,474
...but I'm just chasing the dad
that ran out on me.

864
00:44:26,563 --> 00:44:28,463
Hoochie mama.

865
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,328
What does that mean?

866
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:34,396
I don't know, but it feels right.

867
00:44:41,378 --> 00:44:43,437
I hope that car never gets fixed.

868
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:45,774
I don't think it will.

869
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,348
I took the spark plugs out.

870
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:48,712
Nice.

871
00:44:51,288 --> 00:44:54,485
We're all looking at the same time.
Let's at least take shifts.

872
00:44:54,658 --> 00:44:56,421
Lamonsoff,
you and me look at the tree.

873
00:44:56,593 --> 00:44:59,153
McKenzie, we're gonna look
at her butt for a little bit.

874
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:01,160
All right. Good plan.

875
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:03,625
And, shift.

876
00:45:06,236 --> 00:45:07,362
Shift.

877
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,506
Shift.

878
00:45:11,408 --> 00:45:12,670
Shift.

879
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:14,440
And shift.

880
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,176
What are we doing?

881
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,778
Wait, are we all looking at the tree
right now?

882
00:45:19,983 --> 00:45:21,746
Yeah. Let's go back to the ass.

883
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:24,586
Hey, Jasmine. This is Gloria.

884
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,814
Gloria, this is Jasmine.

885
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:28,457
Hi.

886
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,796
Oh, look, here comes Grandma Gloria
to the rescue.

887
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:34,988
Let me take a look.

888
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:38,225
Oh, honey.

889
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,166
You've blown your gasket.

890
00:45:59,189 --> 00:46:01,282
No good.

891
00:46:02,659 --> 00:46:04,862
That was rough.

892
00:46:04,928 --> 00:46:07,453
If you guys thought seeing them
at the car was gross...

893
00:46:07,631 --> 00:46:09,758
...you should have heard
that waterbed action.

894
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,458
Sounded like two grizzlies
fighting over a salmon.

895
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:15,434
- There was a lot happening.
- At least he's getting something.

896
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:18,336
I've been shut out since Deanne
found out she was pregnant.

897
00:46:18,509 --> 00:46:21,137
- That'll happen.
- You have sex when they're pregnant?

898
00:46:21,311 --> 00:46:23,176
- Does that hurt the baby?
- McKenzie can.

899
00:46:23,347 --> 00:46:25,338
The baby thinks
he's getting a Tootsie Roll.

900
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:27,847
- That's good.
- Snickers. Snickers.

901
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:29,679
A little bigger. A little bigger.

902
00:46:29,853 --> 00:46:33,516
I got lucky on Saint Paddy's Day,
but she was half-asleep.

903
00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:35,590
And by half-asleep,
I mean she was asleep.

904
00:46:35,759 --> 00:46:37,226
Yeah, she was out. Yeah.

905
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:38,656
You're allowed to do that.

906
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:40,490
She'd rather not be awake.

907
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:44,395
- Hey, how'd it go with the daughter?
- Awkward.

908
00:46:45,803 --> 00:46:49,671
I guess the first 20 years of a kid's
life is more important than I realized.

909
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,135
Yeah. It's always the kids who pay.

910
00:46:52,309 --> 00:46:53,674
Kids pay.

911
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:55,209
- They pay.
- They pay.

912
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:57,643
- They always pay.
- But they pay with maize.

913
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,339
Was good hanging with you guys.

914
00:46:59,516 --> 00:47:01,950
- No, no, no. We're catching up.
- Come on, man.

915
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,213
I'm glad my family turmoil can
provide entertainment for you guys.

916
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:08,324
Let's cheer him up. How did we cheer
Robbie up in the old days?

917
00:47:08,492 --> 00:47:10,323
A little arrow roulette?

918
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:12,392
- Arrow roulette.
- Did we really do that?

919
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,497
Single stupidest thing we ever did.

920
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,689
It was the craziest.

921
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,231
- Moronic.
- Asinine.

922
00:47:18,735 --> 00:47:21,761
- All right, fellas.
- I can't believe we're doing this.

923
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:24,908
How do we always let Lenny
talk us into the stupidest stuff?

924
00:47:25,075 --> 00:47:27,839
Remember, whoever stays
in the circle the longest wins.

925
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,343
- I don't like that part.
- Whoever stays longest.

926
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:33,608
Okay, guys, here we go.
And a one. And a two...

927
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,217
Why are we doing this?

928
00:47:36,053 --> 00:47:37,486
Go.

929
00:47:38,555 --> 00:47:39,852
Hold.

930
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:42,886
- I don't see it.
- Where is it?

931
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,618
- I lost it in the sun.
- I lose.

932
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:23,599
Curly.

933
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,282
I am the champion.

934
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:48,083
I beat all you pansies.

935
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,967
Go, go. Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry up.

936
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:02,128
Oh, you're moving it.
You're shaking it.

937
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,364
My hammy.

938
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:06,100
You complaining about your hammy?
I got an arrow in my foot.

939
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,766
- Easy, easy.
- Stay calm.

940
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,139
What's going on?

941
00:49:09,313 --> 00:49:11,975
- Rob got attacked by an Indian.
- Yeah, but he got away.

942
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:13,980
- What?
- He got attacked by an Indian?

943
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:17,518
- Daddy, what happened?
- Amber. I'm glad you got here.

944
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:20,122
This is my daughter Amber,
everybody.

945
00:49:21,391 --> 00:49:22,619
You got another one?

946
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,284
- Dude, high five.
- No, no high five, my wife's coming.

947
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:29,665
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- God, you made me look at this.

948
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,460
This is killing me.

949
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,967
Bridget, come down here.
Daddy's hurt.

950
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,002
- You got another one?
- Yeah.

951
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:38,337
Hey.

952
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,100
- Oh, okay.
- "Hey."

953
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,608
DNA.

954
00:49:41,778 --> 00:49:43,746
- Now I get it.
- Rob's her mom and dad.

955
00:49:43,914 --> 00:49:45,006
Now that makes sense.

956
00:49:45,182 --> 00:49:48,015
Shut up. Foot, arrow, why?

957
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:51,154
- I think we gotta pull it through.
- Oh, let me do it.

958
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:53,712
It was my idea, I said it first.

959
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,326
- Don't you hog it. Don't you touch him.
- Nobody touch him.

960
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,519
We're gonna be all right here.

961
00:49:59,696 --> 00:50:02,494
All we need is a poultice with some
maize that will draw...

962
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,099
Oh, shut up.

963
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:06,258
That poultice shit doesn't work.

964
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:08,097
It never worked. Are you insane?

965
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:10,398
Get some alcohol on this bitch.

966
00:50:10,574 --> 00:50:12,166
You should know plenty about that.

967
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,037
You were born
during the Prohibition.

968
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,304
And there's the snap.

969
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,675
That was bigger
than I thought it was gonna be.

970
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,384
Snap, crackle and pop.

971
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:24,116
Abnormal origin. Pancreas.
Abnormal...

972
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:26,881
Such a mess. Such a mess.
I can not...

973
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:32,953
Excuse me? Princess Rita?
Are you gonna help me?

974
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,099
No, Mr. Feder said
that I must study for the big final.

975
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:37,290
What final?

976
00:50:37,467 --> 00:50:40,197
You tell me.
He just keep handing me books.

977
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,930
Never mind. Did you pack
the adapters for Italy?

978
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:44,539
Yes, I did in L.A.

979
00:50:44,708 --> 00:50:46,039
Great. Just wipe your hands.

980
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:49,701
I need you to organize all these papers
in here very neatly, okay?

981
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,609
They cannot be ruined.

982
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:53,481
Hello.

983
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:56,275
Hi, this is Roxanne Feder.
I just wanna make sure...

984
00:50:56,453 --> 00:50:59,581
Mommy. Mommy.
It came out. It came out.

985
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,485
Hold on,
I'm on the phone, okay?

986
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:03,751
My tooth. It fell out.

987
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,019
That's great, honey.

988
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:08,164
Put it under the pillow
and I'll put a dollar in there later.

989
00:51:08,331 --> 00:51:09,389
What?

990
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,297
Becky, I'm on the phone.
I'll put the dollar under...

991
00:51:14,938 --> 00:51:16,906
Why would you?

992
00:51:19,276 --> 00:51:22,074
There's no Tooth Fairy?

993
00:51:32,055 --> 00:51:34,455
I can't believe I just did that.

994
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,156
Oh, Lenny, you should have seen
her little face.

995
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,355
I don't know what's wrong with me.

996
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:44,967
I mean, I try so hard
and I can't seem to get anything right.

997
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:47,296
You made a mistake.
Parents make mistakes.

998
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:50,963
Remember the time I told Greg that
babies come from mommies' poop...

999
00:51:51,141 --> 00:51:53,735
...and he kept looking in the toilet
for a baby brother?

1000
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:56,674
- That's not funny.
- I'm just saying.

1001
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:59,145
Can you hear me now? Okay.

1002
00:51:59,316 --> 00:52:00,783
I just feel...

1003
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,942
What about now?
Now can you hear me?

1004
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,213
I feel like I ruined her childhood.

1005
00:52:06,423 --> 00:52:08,050
She was gonna find out eventually.

1006
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,887
Eventually, but not today.

1007
00:52:12,062 --> 00:52:13,859
Can you hear me now?
This is so cool.

1008
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:17,693
- Are you there?
- Hey, didn't I say no cell phones?

1009
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,163
I thought we had a deal.

1010
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,202
- What?
- What's up, Dad?

1011
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,401
Are those cup phones?

1012
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,565
Yeah, Charlotte taught us.
Cool, huh?

1013
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:27,835
Hey, check out Becky's.

1014
00:52:28,011 --> 00:52:30,571
Look, Dad. I have cup waiting.

1015
00:52:30,747 --> 00:52:33,079
I gotta call you back,
I'm on with SpongeBob.

1016
00:52:37,053 --> 00:52:38,577
Was that a turkey?

1017
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:40,017
Yo, Andre, can you hear me?

1018
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:41,680
Crystal clear. Can you hear me?

1019
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,348
Oh, yeah.

1020
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,266
So the best thing about these
is we can leave a cup in the shower...

1021
00:52:53,436 --> 00:52:55,734
...and listen to Jasmine
clean herself tomorrow.

1022
00:52:55,906 --> 00:52:57,032
- What?
- Oh, my God!

1023
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:58,799
May I borrow this?

1024
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:00,033
Attention, children.

1025
00:53:00,477 --> 00:53:03,002
There's been a request
from the phone company.

1026
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:08,049
Would you please install cup phones
in every adult bedroom right away?

1027
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,618
Thank you. All right. Go.
Move it, move it, move it.

1028
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:12,277
I said, move it. Move it.

1029
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:37,844
Yes, I have always been
the Tooth Fairy.

1030
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:41,709
No, Bean's mommy
is the Tooth Fairy for his family.

1031
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:44,046
I just cover our family.

1032
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:48,047
No, do not tell Bean, okay?

1033
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,685
Becky, I love you
so, so, so much, okay?

1034
00:53:53,029 --> 00:53:55,293
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

1035
00:53:55,465 --> 00:53:58,400
- Okay, you're costing me a fortune.
- No, you hang up first.

1036
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,866
Let's go.
This is gonna be a high cup bill.

1037
00:54:01,037 --> 00:54:04,006
It's nice to put maize
on your arrow wound.

1038
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:06,438
What the hell is that?
Is that Gloria laughing?

1039
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:09,476
She's still here
after he had a snap on her like that?

1040
00:54:09,646 --> 00:54:13,309
- She forgave him right away.
- You are my special lady.

1041
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,849
And you are my one-footed
maize-covered lover.

1042
00:54:16,286 --> 00:54:18,186
Okay, come on,
we gotta go to sleep.

1043
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,256
We're going to Milan tomorrow, right?
A long flight.

1044
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,051
Let's get our rest.

1045
00:54:25,895 --> 00:54:28,659
Somebody kill that turkey.

1046
00:54:38,975 --> 00:54:41,341
Is that getting me horny?

1047
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:43,406
Yes.

1048
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,715
You promise you'll still feed her
after we leave?

1049
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:48,316
I promise.

1050
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,112
Mommy, that's my milk.

1051
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,154
Bean, we have to learn how to share,
even with birds.

1052
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,814
But he's going to drink you dry.

1053
00:55:02,232 --> 00:55:03,597
This is good.

1054
00:55:12,742 --> 00:55:14,676
I got it three times.

1055
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:17,005
Donna, you wanna try?

1056
00:55:17,614 --> 00:55:19,673
Sure. But I stink at sports.

1057
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:21,544
That's all right. Here.

1058
00:55:21,718 --> 00:55:23,845
- Hold it like this.
- Like this?

1059
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,478
Get down low and throw it,
and let the rock do the magic.

1060
00:55:28,958 --> 00:55:30,220
- Nice.
- Oh, I skipped it.

1061
00:55:30,727 --> 00:55:33,321
- Good job, Donna.
- Bravo.

1062
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,054
Do you know how to skip rocks?

1063
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:37,392
Are you kidding me?
I am the best at this.

1064
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:41,099
Give me that. Now, watch, now.

1065
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,867
Oh, my God, baby, are you okay?

1066
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:51,741
Yeah, Mom, I'm just glad to see you
having some fun.

1067
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,775
I'll take your luggage to the car,
Mr. Feder.

1068
00:55:54,951 --> 00:55:56,851
That's not my luggage,
that's textbooks.

1069
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,147
That's nice of you to take your
own stuff down.

1070
00:55:59,322 --> 00:56:00,346
You're okay. Come on.

1071
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,548
Come on, man.
Already? You're leaving?

1072
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:03,886
Yes, I gotta go.

1073
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:06,051
Do you need any help getting
to the airport?

1074
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,389
We got a little problem.

1075
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:08,792
What? What happened?

1076
00:56:08,965 --> 00:56:11,399
I forgot how to skip a rock.

1077
00:56:11,634 --> 00:56:15,263
Now, I think it's gonna take
a couple of days to figure it out.

1078
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:16,698
So...

1079
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:18,903
...I think we better stay.

1080
00:56:19,075 --> 00:56:20,235
Are you kidding me?

1081
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:23,038
For reals, Mom? We're not leaving?

1082
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,206
I don't need to see a bunch of starving
models walking around in my clothes.

1083
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:30,217
Yeah, why would you wanna see
models when you can see this?

1084
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:34,915
See? You couldn't get that in Milan.

1085
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,483
You.

1086
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,888
You.

1087
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:41,259
What do you wanna do today?
Anything.

1088
00:56:41,431 --> 00:56:42,898
I don't know. You tell me.

1089
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,729
What was your favorite thing to do
when you were 12 and it was sunny?

1090
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:48,996
Well, I can't do that.

1091
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:53,269
Maybe go to a water park.

1092
00:56:53,443 --> 00:56:54,671
What are we waiting for?

1093
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:56,869
- Seriously?
- Let's load up the car, people.

1094
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,070
Are you kidding me?

1095
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,684
- I'm not taking my shirt off.
- I'm not taking my shirt off either.

1096
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:06,686
You're wasting it.

1097
00:57:07,157 --> 00:57:08,181
Sorry.

1098
00:57:09,926 --> 00:57:11,416
It's all right.

1099
00:57:12,328 --> 00:57:14,063
It's actually not that bad.

1100
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:25,268
- Ladies' day.
- All right? You're in charge.

1101
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:30,568
I have to go number two.

1102
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:32,214
Okay, hang on, son.

1103
00:57:32,482 --> 00:57:33,506
Hey, Dad.

1104
00:57:33,683 --> 00:57:35,514
Hey. Where you guys been?

1105
00:57:35,685 --> 00:57:39,314
Well, we didn't bring our swimsuits, so
Marcus went to take us to buy some.

1106
00:57:42,325 --> 00:57:44,452
We got them at a store
called Naughty and Nice.

1107
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,652
Marcus said
it was the only one open.

1108
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:50,459
The only place open?
For bathing suits? In the summer?

1109
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,168
We got my bathing suit
at Stop and Shop.

1110
00:57:54,771 --> 00:57:56,864
Now, that's... I like that one.

1111
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:58,735
Let's hit the water slide.

1112
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,239
Water slide.

1113
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,045
What a beautiful day.

1114
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,915
- God. It's a girls' day.
- I know.

1115
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,215
It is hot.

1116
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,652
Oh, boy.

1117
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,259
- Are we really doing bathing suits?
- God, it's hot.

1118
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:20,988
Come on, girls. We don't know
these people. Who cares?

1119
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:25,123
You're right, who cares? I've been
working all summer on this six-pack.

1120
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:26,325
All right.

1121
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,095
How do you feel about that?

1122
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:32,332
- Baby got front.
- Go, D. Go, D.

1123
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,500
Come on, Sally, it's your turn.
Take it off.

1124
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:36,645
Oh, no.
I have a bit of a chill, actually.

1125
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:37,837
Gloria, how about you?

1126
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,881
I don't own a bathing suit.
But I like to go nude.

1127
00:58:41,050 --> 00:58:43,541
- No, no, no.
- There's children here.

1128
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,848
Hey, somebody likes what he sees.

1129
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,900
- Daddy, this line's not even moving.
- I know.

1130
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:09,408
- I know.
- I want Mommy's milk.

1131
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,069
I know you do, son, but...

1132
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,807
He wants mommy's milk.
Give him some mommy's milk.

1133
00:59:13,983 --> 00:59:15,712
Mommy's milk! Mommy's milk!

1134
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,318
No. No. Damn it.

1135
00:59:17,487 --> 00:59:18,977
No more Mommy's milk, okay?

1136
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:21,419
You want milk,
you're drinking regular milk.

1137
00:59:21,591 --> 00:59:23,650
- Here, kid.
- Hey.

1138
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:27,057
Don't give me any guff right now.
Here's a buck. Run along. Run along.

1139
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,061
Here.
Drink the milk out of the carton.

1140
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,826
I don't know if Mommy
will want me to.

1141
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:35,937
All right, just drink it, okay? Just like
Daddy does. Let me show you, okay?

1142
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:38,300
Okay.

1143
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,068
I'm just like Daddy.

1144
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,440
There you go.

1145
00:59:45,615 --> 00:59:46,673
No more booby milk.

1146
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:49,678
More for us.

1147
00:59:49,852 --> 00:59:52,946
So, ladies, how do we get
Mr. Banana Hammock...

1148
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:56,182
...to come over here, where we can get
a better look at him?

1149
00:59:56,359 --> 00:59:59,795
Okay. Well, there's two big
advantages to breast-feeding...

1150
00:59:59,996 --> 01:00:02,123
...and I'm gonna put mine to work.

1151
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,595
Sally.

1152
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,428
That's it, girl.

1153
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:07,865
Oh, my goodness.

1154
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:11,404
- Work that umbrella pole, baby.
- Sally. Oh, my God.

1155
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,236
- Oh, it's definitely working. Yeah.
- You're good at that.

1156
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,311
- Oh, my God, he likes it.
- Look at him flex.

1157
01:00:17,513 --> 01:00:19,378
No, continue.

1158
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:23,118
All right, doing the back-door shuffle.
Cutting the line. Go.

1159
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,310
Don't get hurt.

1160
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:25,511
Go, go, go.

1161
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,679
Dad, are we allowed
to go through here?

1162
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,116
Absolutely not,
but we're doing it anyway.

1163
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:32,955
All right, your cool dad found this
back in the day.

1164
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:36,427
Go up the ladder.

1165
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:39,329
It's dark in there.
Maybe you should hold my hand.

1166
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:40,729
I'm scared.

1167
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:42,768
Hey. Come here, come here.

1168
01:00:42,939 --> 01:00:45,305
Don't fall for that crap.
You stay away from him.

1169
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,705
What are you talking about?
He's gay, isn't he?

1170
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:49,606
No. He just seems gay.

1171
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:51,076
He's a genius.

1172
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,646
Go, go, go.

1173
01:00:55,018 --> 01:00:57,043
Alrighty, who's next?

1174
01:00:58,221 --> 01:00:59,313
All right, who's next?

1175
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,923
Now's a good time. Charlotte.

1176
01:01:02,091 --> 01:01:03,922
You're up first.

1177
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:07,324
- There you go.
- Have fun, Charlotte.

1178
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,763
There you go. Who's next? Go.

1179
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,506
- Is he coming this way?
- He's coming towards us right now.

1180
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,104
- This is good now.
- He is.

1181
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:25,008
Whatever you do, don't fart.

1182
01:01:31,788 --> 01:01:33,278
Hey, what's up, ladies?

1183
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,553
So you're from around
these parts, eh?

1184
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:40,254
Yeah, I'm from Saskatchetoon.
That's up in Canada, eh?

1185
01:01:41,898 --> 01:01:44,867
You American ladies,
you've been out to Saskatchetoon, eh?

1186
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:53,469
Hoseteasers.

1187
01:01:58,214 --> 01:02:02,116
Everything was on steroids
except for his voice.

1188
01:02:03,352 --> 01:02:04,478
Go, go, go.

1189
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:05,882
Out, out, out.

1190
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,784
Now, now, now.

1191
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:16,589
Next.

1192
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:41,422
All right, who's next?
Hey, weren't you guys just here?

1193
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:44,992
No. I think you have us confused
with some other people.

1194
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:49,359
I don't think so, you're two of the
hottest chicks I've ever seen in my life.

1195
01:02:49,532 --> 01:02:50,931
- Hey.
- What?

1196
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:53,227
- These are my daughters.
- Right.

1197
01:02:53,402 --> 01:02:54,926
Her, definitely.

1198
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,470
Because she's fugly, just like you.

1199
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,130
- Hey.
- Now, who's next?

1200
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,169
Dad. Come on. Hurry up,
I wanna go to Pirate's Plunge.

1201
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:34,571
One second. Yeah, we're going
on all the rides. We're doing them all.

1202
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:35,802
We'll have fun.

1203
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,303
Are you making a sissy?

1204
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:40,739
No, I'm not.

1205
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,886
You know they put a chemical
in the pool that turns urine blue.

1206
01:03:44,053 --> 01:03:47,784
No, no, no, that's an old wives' tale,
sweetie. That's an old wives' tale.

1207
01:03:47,957 --> 01:03:50,482
Oh, my God.
You're humiliating me.

1208
01:04:13,015 --> 01:04:14,346
Mama, Mama.

1209
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,882
Wanna take a picture?

1210
01:04:16,052 --> 01:04:18,282
All right. A little farther.

1211
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:19,912
Farther.

1212
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,886
Farther.

1213
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,386
Gotcha.

1214
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,715
I don't know about this one, Dad.
It's kind of steep.

1215
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,715
It's a little steeper than I remember.

1216
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,353
Okay, let's go on another ride.

1217
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:54,421
- I don't like it either, yeah.
- Come on, we'll get out of here.

1218
01:04:54,590 --> 01:04:58,253
Good thing the kid chickened out
so you don't have to go, right, Feder?

1219
01:04:58,427 --> 01:05:02,158
Why don't you hire somebody
to do it for you, Mr. Richie Rich?

1220
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:04,925
Good idea.
Hey, Wiley, what's up, man?

1221
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:07,501
- Step aside. Let me get this on.
- All right, son.

1222
01:05:09,272 --> 01:05:11,570
Hasta la vista, chicken shiznit.

1223
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,402
Yeah, look at him go.

1224
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:16,171
Go, kid.

1225
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,515
That was good. That was very nice.

1226
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,311
All right, now I want some of this.

1227
01:05:23,486 --> 01:05:25,113
Look at this. Look at this.

1228
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:27,756
- What happened there?
- Attaboy. Way to go, Greggie.

1229
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,949
Backwards, huh? Look at him.

1230
01:05:33,129 --> 01:05:34,994
Backwards, baby.

1231
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,198
You're up, Hollywood.

1232
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,271
I'm up? All right. I don't know how
you follow backwards.

1233
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,204
Just pay attention to the dismount,
would you?

1234
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:05,623
Looks like second place again,
Bailey, huh?

1235
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,688
- Hear this guy? Second place.
- Second place.

1236
01:06:09,065 --> 01:06:10,692
Go down there hanging by your feet.

1237
01:06:10,866 --> 01:06:12,424
Show these idiots.

1238
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:13,625
By my feet?

1239
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,127
Yeah.

1240
01:06:15,838 --> 01:06:16,862
Is that safe?

1241
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:20,138
What do you care? You're an animal.
You're an animal.

1242
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:22,071
I'm an animal.

1243
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:24,711
Wiley.

1244
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,179
- Why don't you do it?
- I got kids.

1245
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:29,818
Yeah, Wiley.

1246
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:33,149
<i>Wiley, Wiley, Wiley.</i>

1247
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:37,522
Oh, you don't need to do this.

1248
01:06:41,030 --> 01:06:42,224
I'm an animal.

1249
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,826
I'm an animal.

1250
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,093
Yeah.

1251
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,099
I can't get my foot out.

1252
01:06:55,378 --> 01:06:56,572
That's how you do it, boy.

1253
01:06:56,746 --> 01:06:58,680
- Becky.
- You can do this.

1254
01:06:58,881 --> 01:07:01,281
- Good. There you go.
- Give me a five.

1255
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,214
Roxanne, look at him.
It's like he totally forgot about me.

1256
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:06,412
Typical man.

1257
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:10,047
They take all you can give and then
they trade you in for some cow.

1258
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,626
I don't know what I'm
supposed to do with these now.

1259
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,262
I do.

1260
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:18,566
Now, see that, buddy?

1261
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:22,135
I did the old bank shot.
Bank's open. Pick a spot. Aim for it.

1262
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:25,034
Oh, yeah. Your dad'll go
50 for 50 with these.

1263
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,801
Really? Because on the Wii,
the bank shot never works.

1264
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,968
Yeah? Well, you should Wii-turn
it and get a Wii-fund.

1265
01:07:31,147 --> 01:07:34,207
Tim Duncan's had about a hundred
game winners with that bad boy.

1266
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,317
Honey, are you watching me?

1267
01:07:36,485 --> 01:07:39,283
Oh, baby, that was hot.

1268
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,356
- Come here, let me show you.
- Way to go, baby.

1269
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:45,460
Move it, move it, move it.
What you gotta do is...

1270
01:07:45,628 --> 01:07:48,290
See the box up there?
Top right corner of it?

1271
01:07:48,464 --> 01:07:49,897
Hello?

1272
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:52,333
Focus, boy, focus. Get off of that.

1273
01:07:52,501 --> 01:07:53,798
Lamonsoff, focus.

1274
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:58,503
Oh, my God, what a perv.

1275
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:00,641
He's totally checking me out.

1276
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,573
He wasn't... I don't know.

1277
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:04,337
All right, come on. Go ahead.

1278
01:08:05,147 --> 01:08:06,876
Follow through. Keep the hand up.

1279
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,516
Are you kidding me?

1280
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,015
Respect.

1281
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:12,677
See how good you can be when
you wear normal clothes?

1282
01:08:12,855 --> 01:08:14,482
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, baby.

1283
01:08:14,657 --> 01:08:16,921
How come you're not
out there playing basketball?

1284
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:20,358
- You know I got...
- You got bunions. Where's Kurt?

1285
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:21,621
Come on, are you scared?

1286
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:23,628
What's wrong with you?

1287
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,032
Stop it.

1288
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:29,228
Somebody's in trouble.

1289
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,107
Not looking good.

1290
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,237
I do the same thing.

1291
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:41,647
All right, I did everybody's first shot
for them.

1292
01:08:41,817 --> 01:08:43,478
Now you do the second one.

1293
01:08:43,652 --> 01:08:45,347
Come on, now.

1294
01:08:45,521 --> 01:08:46,852
No, nobody's doing shots.

1295
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,985
We got kids here, dummy.
Gotta wake up in the morning.

1296
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:53,458
We're gonna biz beers instead.
Who's got beers? Check them off.

1297
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,393
- I'm gonna go with one.
- Yeah, I'll stick with coffee.

1298
01:08:56,565 --> 01:08:57,964
- I'm having this many.
- Cheers.

1299
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:01,900
- I'm breast-feeding, I don't drink.
- I'm just having Metamucil tonight.

1300
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:03,698
What's wrong with you guys?

1301
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:08,673
We used to come up here and party,
man, and get wasted.

1302
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:10,141
You losers.

1303
01:09:10,312 --> 01:09:13,748
Don't worry, you'll grow up one day.
You just have to meet the right girl.

1304
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:17,147
Oh, my older sister
would be perfect for you.

1305
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:19,279
What?

1306
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:23,391
She's legally blind,
but she can see shapes.

1307
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,989
Anyways, Roxanne,
how did you and Lenny meet?

1308
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:28,460
That's a good question.

1309
01:09:28,631 --> 01:09:31,566
How did this blob of crap,
no offense...

1310
01:09:32,067 --> 01:09:35,002
...meet this lovely seorita?

1311
01:09:35,171 --> 01:09:38,766
Oh, he came into the department store
where I was working.

1312
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,101
I helped him.

1313
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,574
He wanted me to try this skirt on.

1314
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:45,179
Oh, the old "try on the skirt" trick.

1315
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,076
I got you. Very sneaky, sis.

1316
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:50,685
Yeah, he did trick me. Afterwards
he made me try on a bra and...

1317
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,117
Hey, I was just trying to help.

1318
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:56,019
- Exactly.
- Okay, okay. I did like him a little.

1319
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,126
It was a good day.

1320
01:09:58,294 --> 01:10:01,024
Oh, God! Oh, my water.
My water's breaking.

1321
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,357
The baby's coming!

1322
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:06,433
- Are you serious?
- Oh, yeah.

1323
01:10:06,602 --> 01:10:07,796
Oh, you.

1324
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:09,531
Oh, my God.

1325
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:11,832
I got you, I got you, I got you.

1326
01:10:12,007 --> 01:10:13,497
All right.

1327
01:10:13,676 --> 01:10:15,439
I'm just playing.

1328
01:10:17,246 --> 01:10:19,111
Oh, my God, it's...

1329
01:10:19,715 --> 01:10:23,378
Do you know this song?
Oh, this song's the best.

1330
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:26,949
This song is the best.

1331
01:10:29,758 --> 01:10:32,784
Oh, this song gets me so horny.

1332
01:10:33,629 --> 01:10:36,257
You know, I was thinking that,
but now not so much.

1333
01:10:36,432 --> 01:10:38,024
I'd like to claim credit for that.

1334
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:41,363
Because that's all part of my
"get some nookie" playlist.

1335
01:10:41,537 --> 01:10:44,506
Get the ladies on the dance floor,
and I got my lady right here.

1336
01:10:44,673 --> 01:10:46,140
Come on, honey.

1337
01:10:46,342 --> 01:10:48,572
- That was a really good move.
- Let's do this.

1338
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,211
Yeah, you guys dance.

1339
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,847
- It has been a while.
- A long while.

1340
01:10:53,015 --> 01:10:54,710
I know how much you love to dance.

1341
01:10:54,883 --> 01:10:57,784
Oh, you know me,
I'm a regular Shabba-Doo.

1342
01:11:15,971 --> 01:11:17,734
Look at you.

1343
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,632
All sexy. Deanne.

1344
01:11:20,809 --> 01:11:22,936
You should change your name
to Deyonc.

1345
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:24,136
Oh, God.

1346
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,645
Yeah, so now he thinks
I'm sexy, huh?

1347
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,978
Can I just enjoy a dance
with my fine-ass wife?

1348
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:33,615
Yes. To the whitest song ever. Yes.

1349
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:37,054
Yes, this is the whitest song
I've ever heard.

1350
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:41,029
You know, Lenny, you were right
about bringing us here.

1351
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,754
This place is really special.

1352
01:11:42,931 --> 01:11:44,592
It is, right?

1353
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:48,066
Nothing's going on here,
and I love it.

1354
01:11:48,237 --> 01:11:51,695
Roxanne, I have made out with about
25 different girls in this very spot...

1355
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:53,569
...and I want you to be number 26.

1356
01:11:54,009 --> 01:11:55,374
As long as I'm the last one.

1357
01:11:55,544 --> 01:11:57,637
Oh, that's a guarantee.

1358
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:00,482
I'm horny too.

1359
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,307
Hey, what are you doing? You idiot.

1360
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:18,992
Lamonsoff. What are you doing up?

1361
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,727
- I gotta tell you, it was crazy.
- What?

1362
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,737
Sally. She just attacked me.

1363
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,240
Like never before. It was insane.

1364
01:12:28,410 --> 01:12:30,503
I just did the same thing
with my woman.

1365
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:32,112
Really?

1366
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:39,984
Hey, where's Saskatchetoon?

1367
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,849
Yeah. I don't know.

1368
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:57,030
- What am I?
- A hoseteaser.

1369
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,697
- And where are you from?
- Saskatchetoon.

1370
01:13:00,442 --> 01:13:02,103
Look at this.

1371
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:03,608
- And what am I?
- A hoseteaser.

1372
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:06,543
- And where are you from?
- Saskatchetoon.

1373
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:09,208
What are we gonna do
with Higgins?

1374
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,252
Yeah, and you know what?
This is what pisses me off:

1375
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:16,289
You can't be passed-out drunk, single,
with no responsibility and not pay.

1376
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:17,789
You have to be hurt for that.

1377
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:19,757
Yeah.

1378
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,462
Sweetheart?

1379
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,395
You fell asleep on the couch again.

1380
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,667
You know you supposed
to go to your room.

1381
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,304
You're bad.

1382
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:31,496
No.

1383
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:34,069
Marcus, the bird is all better.

1384
01:13:34,243 --> 01:13:37,371
Marcus. He wants to talk to you.

1385
01:13:41,116 --> 01:13:45,109
Marcus, you're gonna be the best
lifeguard at the whole pool.

1386
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:46,584
Hold your breath, honey.

1387
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,950
Hold your breath, honey.

1388
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:53,788
Who's that?

1389
01:13:53,962 --> 01:13:56,430
Oh, it's mommy's boyfriend.

1390
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,031
The one who touches you.

1391
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:03,801
He's crying, he's crying.

1392
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,639
- All right, quiet.
- Hi, Mama.

1393
01:14:08,811 --> 01:14:11,006
- All right. It's all right.
- Mama?

1394
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:14,478
- Okay, baby. It's okay, precious.
- Mama?

1395
01:14:14,650 --> 01:14:16,174
I'm gonna take you upstairs.

1396
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:20,048
Go and put your PJ's on, okay?
You can't fall asleep...

1397
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:22,816
You can't just sleep anywhere,
you know that.

1398
01:14:22,991 --> 01:14:24,219
You go to your room.

1399
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:26,384
- Go to sleep.
- You go to your room.

1400
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,792
- What you doing?
- Come here.

1401
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,127
This isn't a closet.
This is your bedroom.

1402
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:36,397
Okay? It's also your bathroom.
You can make a pee-pee.

1403
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,767
I'm making a pee-pee.

1404
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:46,113
Happy Fourth of July, everyone.

1405
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:51,344
It's the birdy's Independence Day too,
so keep your fingers crossed, honey.

1406
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:53,112
- She did it, Daddy.
- Here we go.

1407
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:54,949
- Bye, birdy.
- She's flying.

1408
01:14:55,123 --> 01:14:58,183
She's gonna be a veterinarian.
Is this girl incredible or what?

1409
01:15:04,900 --> 01:15:06,925
That's so sexy. What did you say?

1410
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:08,569
Oh, I think that she said:

1411
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:11,664
Milan.

1412
01:15:12,774 --> 01:15:15,675
You know, these guys at the store
were talking so much smack...

1413
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,506
...about this basketball rematch
that's supposed to go on.

1414
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,978
Well, I'm glad we're getting
these uniforms ready.

1415
01:15:21,149 --> 01:15:24,084
No more drinkie.

1416
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,683
Did you really sleep in the closet,
you drunk?

1417
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,855
Think so.

1418
01:15:34,096 --> 01:15:35,859
No.

1419
01:15:36,632 --> 01:15:38,600
Oh, God, Higgins.

1420
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,327
- That's disgusting.
- You slob.

1421
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:48,343
Oh, I had the sexiest dream
about a little blond girl, though.

1422
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:53,911
I think it was a dream.

1423
01:15:54,082 --> 01:15:56,642
- Oh, nice. Classy.
- Sick.

1424
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:02,415
These deviled eggs would really be
good if you had some marinara sauce.

1425
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:03,785
Oh, it's Lenny's phone.

1426
01:16:03,959 --> 01:16:04,983
Hello?

1427
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,759
All right, here we go.

1428
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,089
Oh, that's a three.

1429
01:16:08,263 --> 01:16:11,130
That's one, two, three, ladder.
Ladder.

1430
01:16:11,300 --> 01:16:14,269
Oh, that's it.
The rich keep getting richer.

1431
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:16,461
All right. All right.
Schniggly is here.

1432
01:16:16,638 --> 01:16:19,232
So, come on, Robbie,
tell the man what's going on.

1433
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:20,500
He doesn't care.

1434
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,804
- Tell him.
- What are you talking about? Tell him.

1435
01:16:23,979 --> 01:16:26,504
Gloria and I are thinking
about having a baby.

1436
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:27,740
How great is that?

1437
01:16:29,818 --> 01:16:31,183
That's great.

1438
01:16:31,353 --> 01:16:34,345
You know, the good news is she can't
get any more stretch marks.

1439
01:16:35,457 --> 01:16:36,981
- Boy, that's a good one.
- Come on.

1440
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:41,118
You know, the good thing also is
Gloria and the kid can share diapers.

1441
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:42,763
Man. You see, that's just ugly.

1442
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:45,798
He doesn't get it. He's not
in a committed relationship.

1443
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:48,937
He can't, because he can't stay
in a committed relationship.

1444
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:51,971
Oh, look. He's just mad
because all the girls I go out with...

1445
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:55,303
...are 70 to 80 years younger
than his wife.

1446
01:16:55,477 --> 01:16:56,569
Can't stop.

1447
01:16:56,745 --> 01:17:00,977
The last one I was with, she's blond,
she's tall, super hot. Not your type.

1448
01:17:01,149 --> 01:17:04,607
Me and blondie, we start going at it
and we're shaking the bed...

1449
01:17:04,786 --> 01:17:06,981
Shaking the bed?
What does shaking the bed mean?

1450
01:17:07,155 --> 01:17:10,147
I don't know, I just know wetting
the bed. I don't know...

1451
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,384
And then, right at the "good part."
you know?

1452
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:15,962
This picture behind, right on the wall,
falls and goes:

1453
01:17:16,498 --> 01:17:17,795
Hits her on the forehead.

1454
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,126
She cut her head.

1455
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:20,928
It cuts her. I didn't slow down.

1456
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:24,163
I just throw her two aspirins,
she yaps on them like a Frisbee dog.

1457
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,978
I am tired. Marcus, your snoring
kept me up all night long.

1458
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:36,079
You're a dead man. Get back here.

1459
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:40,312
Come back here. That's my baby girl.
I thought you were my friend.

1460
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:42,184
Leave me alone. Drink your maize.

1461
01:17:42,357 --> 01:17:44,518
You're gonna pay this time.

1462
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:47,492
You bastard.
I'll show you how to be nice.

1463
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:49,927
- Bad turtles.
- You evil pig.

1464
01:17:51,233 --> 01:17:52,860
- Robbie, wait.
- He's psycho.

1465
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:54,297
Stop. Stop.

1466
01:17:54,469 --> 01:17:56,664
Hey, break it up, man. Jeez, guys.

1467
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:57,964
- All right.
- Calm down.

1468
01:17:58,140 --> 01:18:00,040
Buddy. Buddy. What's the problem?

1469
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:05,873
Oh, yeah. Arrow foot.

1470
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:08,710
- Come here, baby.
- Come on. Why are you fighting?

1471
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:10,579
Good to see midget wrestling again.

1472
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,084
How could you do that?
That's my daughter.

1473
01:18:13,255 --> 01:18:15,723
- Do what?
- Shake the bed with her.

1474
01:18:15,891 --> 01:18:17,916
You think I would do that to you?

1475
01:18:18,293 --> 01:18:20,591
Out of any of us
you'd be the one to do that.

1476
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,957
You did sleep
with Stimpson's mother.

1477
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:26,362
I didn't even know that guy.
He was your friend. I barely knew him.

1478
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,765
She grabbed my wiener,
I told you guys.

1479
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:31,201
- That's his daughter. It's different.
- Me and him?

1480
01:18:32,441 --> 01:18:36,036
Okay. Maybe I flirted with him,
but that was just to get your attention.

1481
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:38,338
- Well, what about his snoring?
- I heard it too.

1482
01:18:42,951 --> 01:18:44,919
Oh, no. Twice?

1483
01:18:45,087 --> 01:18:46,952
We heard it from three rooms away.

1484
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:50,580
He's off the hook. You know Marcus
wouldn't be with your daughter.

1485
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:53,421
I mean, not that she's...
You know what I'm saying.

1486
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:57,698
- Well, what happened to your head?
- When I was changing into my PJs...

1487
01:18:57,866 --> 01:19:00,994
...I got the feeling that some perv
was looking through my window...

1488
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:05,037
...so I went to go close the shade
and I tripped and hit my head.

1489
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:07,906
Yeah, dude, that's your daughter.

1490
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:10,510
I'd never be with her.
You're my best friend, man.

1491
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:13,147
And Jasmine'd never be with me,
because I'm me.

1492
01:19:13,548 --> 01:19:16,449
Look, sorry I don't have
my whole life together, like Lenny.

1493
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,552
Oh, together, like Lenny.

1494
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:20,245
Please.

1495
01:19:20,622 --> 01:19:22,419
I answered your phone, <i>hipcrita.</i>

1496
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:23,819
It was your assistant.

1497
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:26,960
I asked him if he canceled
the flight to Milan. He said he did.

1498
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,994
Before we even came here.

1499
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:31,962
He said that? Why would he say that?
I mean...

1500
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:33,624
So he just made that up, huh?

1501
01:19:33,802 --> 01:19:35,394
I'm not saying he made it up.

1502
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:38,266
I'm think...
In his head he believes it's true.

1503
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:39,998
Don't you agent me, Lenny.

1504
01:19:40,175 --> 01:19:42,609
Stop trying to handle
everybody and everything...

1505
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:45,406
...and start taking a little
responsibility for once.

1506
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,105
I'll take responsibility.
Okay? You're right.

1507
01:19:48,283 --> 01:19:51,810
I thought it would be better for our
family to be here with normal people...

1508
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:53,750
...instead of going to Milan.

1509
01:19:53,922 --> 01:19:55,184
We're normal?

1510
01:19:55,357 --> 01:19:59,088
I was scared to tell you.
It was easier for me to keep it a secret.

1511
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,094
You peel back any marriage,
there are secrets.

1512
01:20:02,497 --> 01:20:04,761
Mine is I love you.
I love you very much.

1513
01:20:04,933 --> 01:20:06,628
Roxanne, I just... I...

1514
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:11,034
Our kids are becoming nutty,
snotty, spoiled...

1515
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:14,433
- We got a nanny, we got...
- So she is a nanny.

1516
01:20:14,609 --> 01:20:16,008
No, no, no. She's not a nanny.

1517
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:18,009
Of course she's a nanny.

1518
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:20,205
When does the lying stop?

1519
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:21,679
It stops right after this.

1520
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:23,784
She's more of an au pair.
Not a nanny.

1521
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,681
Lenny.

1522
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:29,551
All right. That's it.
The lying stops now.

1523
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:31,988
I won't lie to you ever again.
I swear to God.

1524
01:20:32,160 --> 01:20:33,457
I love you.

1525
01:20:33,628 --> 01:20:35,118
Men lie.

1526
01:20:35,530 --> 01:20:37,464
They can't help themselves.

1527
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,566
Kurt sure as hell lies.

1528
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,225
What do I lie about,
Toe-J Simpson?

1529
01:20:42,404 --> 01:20:44,497
Oh, please. The nanny.

1530
01:20:44,873 --> 01:20:45,999
What about the nanny?

1531
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,199
You have a thing for her.

1532
01:20:48,376 --> 01:20:52,369
I do not have a thing for the nanny.
I'm a married man. Period.

1533
01:20:52,814 --> 01:20:56,443
But did I enjoy a nice conversation
with a woman that wasn't going...

1534
01:20:56,618 --> 01:21:00,418
..."Where's this?" and
"Did you pick up that?" Yeah.

1535
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:02,716
What, you can have
nice conversations with me.

1536
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:05,056
When? You're always working.

1537
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:07,923
And when you come home,
you're just tired all the time.

1538
01:21:08,129 --> 01:21:10,359
You barely even touch me
or look at me.

1539
01:21:10,532 --> 01:21:13,228
He sounds like an old woman.

1540
01:21:13,401 --> 01:21:17,667
Deanne, you should have married
Umberto Denunzio like I told you.

1541
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:22,071
And if I had stayed with him you'd be
the one that's pregnant now, Mama.

1542
01:21:22,644 --> 01:21:24,771
You probably right, sweetheart.

1543
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:26,670
I'll just butt out.

1544
01:21:26,848 --> 01:21:28,509
Thank you.

1545
01:21:28,683 --> 01:21:31,675
Look, maybe I do take you for granted,
and I'm sorry.

1546
01:21:32,187 --> 01:21:35,281
How's about I take you out every
Thursday night for date night.

1547
01:21:35,857 --> 01:21:39,623
No, Thursday's <i>Grey's Anatomy,</i>
but any other night would be beautiful.

1548
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:46,659
And as long as we're all being honest,
I think I should be honest too.

1549
01:21:47,702 --> 01:21:51,934
I'm actually not a part owner
of the lawn furniture store.

1550
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:55,042
I don't even work there anymore.

1551
01:21:55,210 --> 01:21:57,576
I got laid off in April.

1552
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,543
But I rented the Caddy...

1553
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:03,582
...and I acted like a big shot because
I didn't want you guys to know.

1554
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:04,980
Lamonsoff.

1555
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:07,781
You don't have to hide
anything from us. I'm sorry.

1556
01:22:07,956 --> 01:22:11,756
Yeah. Since we're getting things
off our chests here...

1557
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:14,088
...I got a confession to make.

1558
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:17,492
I'm wearing a toup.

1559
01:22:17,666 --> 01:22:18,997
No shit.

1560
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,066
I have a confession to make.

1561
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:25,971
I'm really a man.

1562
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:28,802
- No.
- I said that.

1563
01:22:28,977 --> 01:22:33,573
- Are you kidding?
- No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.

1564
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,683
I'm really a little hurt that so many
of you believed it.

1565
01:22:36,851 --> 01:22:39,183
- We were just saying that...
- You're very womanly.

1566
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:43,586
Nevertheless.
I know it's not my place, but...

1567
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:46,522
Well, after all,
I am older than anyone here.

1568
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,526
Hell, yeah, you are.

1569
01:22:50,332 --> 01:22:54,268
Well, despite the joking and
the razzing, I see a lot of love here.

1570
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:57,462
And with love comes hostility.

1571
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:01,765
Like Rob when he snapped at me
the other day.

1572
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:03,103
That was scary.

1573
01:23:03,278 --> 01:23:06,179
And you all thought that I was so calm,
but inside?

1574
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:07,975
Inside I was saying:

1575
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,776
"Gloria Noonan...

1576
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:13,886
...do not call him a bug-eyed sociopath
with a little-man complex.

1577
01:23:14,622 --> 01:23:18,649
Do not say that his hair makes him
look like a dirty Q-tip."

1578
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:19,851
I like that.

1579
01:23:20,462 --> 01:23:24,228
"Or that he resembles an elder gay
Jonas brother."

1580
01:23:24,399 --> 01:23:27,391
They get it. They get the point
of where you're going.

1581
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:30,129
"Or a midget Filipino Fonzie."
I didn't say those things.

1582
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:32,569
- That's my favorite one.
- Hey.

1583
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:34,038
Toupee.

1584
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,700
Life can be difficult sometimes.

1585
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,972
It gets bumpy,
what with family and kids...

1586
01:23:40,148 --> 01:23:43,140
...and things not going
exactly like you planned.

1587
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:45,718
But that's what makes it interesting.

1588
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:49,152
In life, the first act, always exciting.

1589
01:23:49,324 --> 01:23:51,417
The second act...

1590
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,828
...that's where the depth comes in.

1591
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,589
Why didn't you ever tell us
that she gets it?

1592
01:23:57,766 --> 01:23:59,256
Yeah, you were holding out.

1593
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,698
That's what I've been trying
to tell you guys.

1594
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:04,202
That was beautiful, honey.
That was beautiful.

1595
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:08,607
Group hug.

1596
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:39,271
Okay, it's in position.

1597
01:24:39,441 --> 01:24:41,341
I don't know, man.
This thing looks crazy.

1598
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:44,273
It'll be fun. I spent all morning
blowing that thing up.

1599
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:45,743
You should be all right.

1600
01:24:45,914 --> 01:24:48,405
- Should be?
- Yeah.

1601
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,578
Ready?

1602
01:24:52,120 --> 01:24:53,553
Go.

1603
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,091
Let's do that again.

1604
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:06,290
It's not a favor. It's like a great
investment for me, man.

1605
01:25:06,468 --> 01:25:07,958
A car detailing center.

1606
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:10,400
And there's none around,
it's gonna be a goldmine.

1607
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,130
I don't wanna take your money.

1608
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:15,174
- You're making me more.
- I want in, okay?

1609
01:25:15,343 --> 01:25:18,278
I know the owner of the Celtics.
And I can get us that account.

1610
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:20,812
Those guys all drive
Bentleys and Ferraris.

1611
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,506
How do you know
the owner of the Celtics?

1612
01:25:22,684 --> 01:25:25,278
Hey, I'm the leader
of his daughter's Girl Scout troop.

1613
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:28,183
If he wants to make sure
she gets her Cookie Biz badge...

1614
01:25:28,356 --> 01:25:29,846
...he will give us that account.

1615
01:25:31,559 --> 01:25:33,493
- I love you guys.
- I love it. I love it.

1616
01:25:36,364 --> 01:25:38,264
You ready to have some fun?

1617
01:25:38,800 --> 01:25:39,994
Yeah. Hit it.

1618
01:25:44,205 --> 01:25:45,866
Okay.

1619
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,205
Go. Go. You gotta get it in high.

1620
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:03,620
You really wanna do this, Bailey?

1621
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,452
My five against your five.

1622
01:26:05,627 --> 01:26:07,356
Oh, boy, look at this.

1623
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:09,292
I see the boys
stayed in shape, huh?

1624
01:26:10,798 --> 01:26:12,288
Robideaux, good to see you.

1625
01:26:12,800 --> 01:26:13,824
Lenny.

1626
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:15,902
If you're looking at me, I don't know.

1627
01:26:19,207 --> 01:26:23,109
Look, we just wanna eat watermelon
and relax, if you're all right with that.

1628
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:27,214
Oh, no. It's not all right. You're not
gonna weasel out of this one, Feder.

1629
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:31,512
Wiley snuck out of intensive care
to see you finally get some justice.

1630
01:26:31,686 --> 01:26:34,712
Yo. You best be getting
to balling, Feder.

1631
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:37,915
Oh, hey, Wiley.
Was the field goal good?

1632
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:40,691
Yeah.
First time I ever heard that one.

1633
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,853
Okay. Sorry, man.

1634
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:47,332
Do you want me to get something off
the top shelf? Heard that one a lot too.

1635
01:26:48,336 --> 01:26:51,772
Seriously, Dickie, let us just hang out
with our families. We wanna relax.

1636
01:26:51,940 --> 01:26:54,704
Yeah. They're afraid of us.
That's what it is.

1637
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:57,936
We're afraid you might eat the ball
before we even start the game.

1638
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:02,676
Same old Higgins.
He can talk the talk but he can't...

1639
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:05,276
I forget the rest.

1640
01:27:06,354 --> 01:27:10,017
We got Rob here with the bad foot.
You can't do it, right, buddy?

1641
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:14,855
I think if the Buzzer was here,
he'd want me to try.

1642
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,421
I think he'd want us all to try.

1643
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,632
Was that William Shatner?

1644
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:24,402
- All right, let's do this, then.
- It's on.

1645
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:26,631
Game to 21.

1646
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:37,643
Hey, hey. Okay, come on.

1647
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:47,419
Guys! Look!

1648
01:28:26,801 --> 01:28:29,861
Well, well, well, if it isn't the other
black guy who grew up here.

1649
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:33,496
No, no, no. In this town, I'm the black
guy and you're the other black guy.

1650
01:28:33,675 --> 01:28:35,540
No, man, in this town,
I'm the black guy.

1651
01:28:35,710 --> 01:28:38,270
White people see me coming
in their store, they get scared.

1652
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:41,472
Yeah? When white people see me
coming into their store, they run.

1653
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,981
Yeah, yeah. These my white people.
Go get your own.

1654
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,983
You crazy, man.

1655
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,798
Lucky shot.

1656
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:05,166
<i>Defense, defense, defense.</i>

1657
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:11,836
In your face.

1658
01:29:14,582 --> 01:29:17,016
Hey, guys. Motion '78.

1659
01:29:32,934 --> 01:29:34,333
<i>To me, man.</i>

1660
01:29:48,416 --> 01:29:51,180
Show me what you got. Say what?

1661
01:29:51,352 --> 01:29:54,287
Hey, Y! Where's M-C-A?

1662
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,628
What the hell is that?
Sounds like owls having sex.

1663
01:30:05,800 --> 01:30:07,233
Robideaux, heads up.

1664
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:14,166
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Did that go in?

1665
01:30:31,125 --> 01:30:33,821
You made me spill
my freaking beer.

1666
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,520
Honey, why does everything
always have to be about you?

1667
01:30:36,697 --> 01:30:38,756
Why do you always have to be
such a dink?

1668
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,545
Get that. Yeah, yeah, right there.

1669
01:30:53,347 --> 01:30:54,905
I can't do this anymore.

1670
01:30:55,082 --> 01:30:56,276
I can't even breathe.

1671
01:30:56,451 --> 01:30:59,113
I haven't felt my legs
since the second quarter.

1672
01:30:59,287 --> 01:31:00,845
Hey, you wanna fake injuries?

1673
01:31:01,022 --> 01:31:02,256
- You got it.
- Okay.

1674
01:31:03,191 --> 01:31:04,351
- Oh, my...
- Oh, God!

1675
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:06,584
I can't go on.
I got a slippery disk.

1676
01:31:06,761 --> 01:31:08,023
Oh, hon.

1677
01:31:08,196 --> 01:31:09,959
- Oh, it just slipped out.
- I'm done.

1678
01:31:10,131 --> 01:31:12,497
Somebody's gonna have
a heart attack.

1679
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:14,191
What are you doing?

1680
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:15,801
That's it?

1681
01:31:15,970 --> 01:31:17,494
Darth Vader, let's go. Sit down.

1682
01:31:17,672 --> 01:31:19,003
Please, honey.

1683
01:31:19,173 --> 01:31:21,107
Is that a cannoli from Virgilio's?

1684
01:31:23,044 --> 01:31:25,512
Did you seriously just take
your daughter's cannoli?

1685
01:31:25,680 --> 01:31:27,705
It's from Virgilio's. Leave me alone.

1686
01:31:27,882 --> 01:31:29,611
Don't choke, Daddy.

1687
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:33,214
What do you say we bring my son
and your son into this?

1688
01:31:33,387 --> 01:31:35,048
- Done.
- Greggie.

1689
01:31:35,223 --> 01:31:37,817
- Me?
- Yeah. Go, Greg.

1690
01:31:37,992 --> 01:31:39,983
Come on, baby. You can do this.

1691
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:41,219
Hey, Bailey.

1692
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:46,397
Somebody fill up that jug with some
Boss water, for the Hollywood kid.

1693
01:31:46,567 --> 01:31:48,194
It's Voss, with a V.

1694
01:31:50,638 --> 01:31:54,972
Would you mind if I touch your belly?
I love babies. I love to feel them kick.

1695
01:31:55,142 --> 01:31:57,235
- Yeah, go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.

1696
01:32:01,582 --> 01:32:03,982
That's not my baby, that's my boob.

1697
01:32:04,151 --> 01:32:05,982
- Oh, I like to feel those too.
- Hey.

1698
01:32:06,153 --> 01:32:08,587
Hey, no harm done.

1699
01:32:08,756 --> 01:32:11,020
- All right, take it out. Come on.
- Sixteen to 16.

1700
01:32:11,192 --> 01:32:13,183
Half court, two on two. Let's go.

1701
01:32:14,695 --> 01:32:16,686
Keep your feet off the line this time.

1702
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:19,765
It's tied score. Tied score.
Let's see something. Nice throw.

1703
01:32:19,934 --> 01:32:21,231
Tied score, guys.

1704
01:32:27,074 --> 01:32:29,042
All right, son. All right.

1705
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:33,442
- We're up 19-16. Let's go.
- All right, son. Give me the ball.

1706
01:32:34,549 --> 01:32:37,074
- Come on, son.
- That's it, Greg. You can do it.

1707
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:38,582
You know what's going on.

1708
01:32:44,225 --> 01:32:46,785
Oh, yes. It's raining threes
on Hollywood.

1709
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:49,987
His foot was on the line.
Your foot was on the line.

1710
01:32:50,164 --> 01:32:51,927
It ain't raining threes.

1711
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:55,091
- It's drizzling twos!
- That's all right. Good shot.

1712
01:32:55,269 --> 01:32:58,568
- Wasn't no three. Foot was on the line.
- Next basket wins. Let's go.

1713
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:00,438
Come on.

1714
01:33:02,076 --> 01:33:03,202
This is it, pal.

1715
01:33:03,778 --> 01:33:05,871
Take him out, baby.

1716
01:33:07,048 --> 01:33:09,983
All right, all right, all right.
Take him, baby. Take him.

1717
01:33:14,889 --> 01:33:16,117
Pop it, Lenny.

1718
01:33:17,959 --> 01:33:20,052
Bank's open, Dad.

1719
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:47,415
He never misses that shot.

1720
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,987
Down goes Hollywood.

1721
01:33:54,161 --> 01:33:55,822
Down goes Hollywood.

1722
01:33:55,997 --> 01:33:57,862
Down goes Hollywood.

1723
01:34:00,034 --> 01:34:04,300
We'll crush them next year. I'll work
on my left when we get back to L.A.

1724
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:06,497
- That's my boy. I love you.
- I love you too.

1725
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:07,698
You're awesome.

1726
01:34:09,010 --> 01:34:11,171
- Way to go!
- We did it!

1727
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,069
Hey, Lenny.

1728
01:34:45,246 --> 01:34:47,680
I thought you never missed
a bank shot.

1729
01:34:47,848 --> 01:34:49,907
Yeah. Well, I just thought...

1730
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:54,014
...the Baileys needed to learn how
to win every once in a while...

1731
01:34:54,188 --> 01:34:56,986
...and Feders needed to learn
how to lose.

1732
01:34:58,426 --> 01:34:59,723
- That was nice.
- Yeah?

1733
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:01,828
I'm proud of you.

1734
01:35:02,797 --> 01:35:03,923
Look at these guys.

1735
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:10,734
- Lenny. Hey, man.
- Yeah, buddy.

1736
01:35:10,905 --> 01:35:13,567
I know you're bummed about losing
the game for us.

1737
01:35:13,741 --> 01:35:14,765
And you're drunk?

1738
01:35:14,942 --> 01:35:17,672
- No. Yes.
- Oh, okay.

1739
01:35:17,845 --> 01:35:20,279
Hey, man, there's one thing
they'll never beat us at.

1740
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:22,245
What's this?

1741
01:35:22,950 --> 01:35:25,783
Arrow roulette, baby.

1742
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:27,443
- We are good at that.
- Yeah.

1743
01:35:27,621 --> 01:35:29,179
- All right.
- What are you doing?

1744
01:35:29,356 --> 01:35:31,449
- Last one to stay in wins.
- No, no, no.

1745
01:35:31,625 --> 01:35:33,286
Becky.

1746
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:38,092
Run away. Not again.

1747
01:35:38,833 --> 01:35:40,596
Get out of my way.

1748
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,380
Little help here? Take me with you?

1749
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:04,115
Seriously, you're gonna leave me?

1750
01:36:04,291 --> 01:36:05,383
No.

1751
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:13,062
We win again.
