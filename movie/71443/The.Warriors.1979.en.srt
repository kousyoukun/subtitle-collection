1
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,052
It's still on, and we're going.

2
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:20,847
Cyrus sent an emissary this afternoon
to make sure.

3
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,975
Now, Cyrus don't want anybody packed.

4
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,769
He don't want anybody
flexing any muscle.

5
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:29,147
I gave him my word that the Warriors
would uphold the truce.

6
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,027
Everybody says that Cyrus
is the one and only.

7
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,366
I think we'd better
go have a look for ourself.

8
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,661
-We ain't been to the Bronx before.
-No sweat.

9
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,788
This conclave's gonna be
a real big item.

10
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,249
Every gang in the city is gonna be there.

11
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,471
We're going in there with nothing.

12
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,890
We're going in there
like everybody else.

13
00:04:26,974 --> 00:04:28,767
Nine guys, no weapons.

14
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,226
You got the stuff?

15
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,603
I want you to hit everything in sight.

16
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,106
I want everybody to know
the Warriors were there.

17
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,477
You never know what
you're gonna run into out there.

18
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:56,396
-Wearing our colors, we can't hide.
-Who wants to hide?

19
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,768
Maybe we'll get to waste a few heads
along the way.

20
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:37,145
You just soldier
and keep your mouth shut.

21
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:47,405
When we get there,
you stick close by, okay?

22
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,407
Don't worry.
I don't feel like getting wrecked.

23
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:54,371
One thing we might get
out of Cyrus' little get-together

24
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:56,456
is meeting some strange wool.

25
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:59,084
I wouldn't mind laying something down
on the way back.

26
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:01,169
You got a one-track brain,
you know that?

27
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,796
What's the matter? You going faggot?

28
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,465
What do you know about Cyrus?

29
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:07,384
Magic.

30
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:09,886
A whole lot of magic.

31
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:14,391
-What do you know about Cyrus?
-He's the one and only.

32
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,310
When you're president
of the biggest gang in the city,

33
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,437
you don't have to take any shit.

34
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,730
Fuck him.

35
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,829
I'll tell you something,
I'll bet nobody's even gonna be there.

36
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,540
Can you count, suckers?

37
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,755
I say the future is ours

38
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,510
if you can count!

39
00:09:19,266 --> 00:09:22,686
-Come on, Cyrus, we're with you !
-Go ahead, bro!

40
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,360
Now, look what we have here before us.

41
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,363
We've got the Saracens

42
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,740
sitting next to the Jones Street Boys.

43
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,202
We've got the Moon Runners

44
00:09:39,286 --> 00:09:42,122
right by the Van Courtland Rangers.

45
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,668
Nobody is wasting nobody.

46
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:48,753
That

47
00:09:49,588 --> 00:09:51,423
is a miracle.

48
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,467
And miracles

49
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:56,970
is the way things ought to be.

50
00:09:57,012 --> 00:09:58,930
-Yeah !
-I heard that!

51
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,602
-I heard that.
-Come get answered !

52
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:12,485
You're standing right now
with nine delegates from 1 00 gangs.

53
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,489
And there's over 1 00 more.

54
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:20,827
That's 20,000 hard-core members.

55
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,414
Forty thousand, counting affiliates,

56
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:28,126
and 20,000 more,
not organized but ready to fight.

57
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,339
Sixty thousand soldiers.

58
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:39,763
Now, there ain't but
20,000 police in the whole town.

59
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,140
Can you dig it?

60
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,476


61
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,855
-Can you dig it?
-Yeah !

62
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,829
Now here's the sum total.

63
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:09,209
One gang could run this city.

64
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:11,878
One gang.

65
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:16,466
Nothing would move
without us allowing it to happen.

66
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,761
We could tax the crime syndicates,

67
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:21,304
the police,

68
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:24,557
because we got the streets, suckers!

69
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:29,479
-Can you dig it?
-Yeah !

70
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:48,081
Right on !

71
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,424
The problem in the past

72
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,344
has been the man
turning us against one another.

73
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:04,264
We have been unable to see the truth,

74
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:09,185
because we've been fighting
for 1 0 square feet of ground,

75
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,648
our turf, our little piece of turf.

76
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:16,693
That's crap, brothers.

77
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,071
The turf is ours by right

78
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,073
because it's our turn.

79
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,744
All we have to do

80
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,705
is keep up the general truce.

81
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,876
We take over one borough at a time.

82
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:36,754
Secure our territory.

83
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,633
Secure our turf.

84
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:46,139
Because it's all our turf.

85
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:50,310
Yeah !

86
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,492
The other way, against the crowd !

87
00:14:29,576 --> 00:14:31,327
And keep your ass down !

88
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,912
Down !

89
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,378
Get out of the way.

90
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,728
-They'll kill us all.
-Watch out, man. Watch his head.

91
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,315
There wasn't supposed to be no guns!

92
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,279
Come on, move it!

93
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:07,947
-Is Cleon all right?
-I think he's up there.

94
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,574
-Are you sure?
-No.

95
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,117
Come on ! Move it!

96
00:15:15,914 --> 00:15:18,332
There he is! That's him !

97
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,460
That's the Warrior!

98
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,964
-He shot Cyrus!
-Man, you're crazy. I didn't do nothing.

99
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,759
-We saw him !
-Yeah, that's him.

100
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:31,637
He's the one. He's the one!
The Warriors did it!

101
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,682
The Warriors did it! The Warriors did it!

102
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,976
The Warriors did it!

103
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,822
Kill him !

104
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,886
Down. Everybody down !

105
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:55,388
-Shit!
-You all right?

106
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:56,764
Yeah.

107
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,235
Everybody quiet.

108
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:34,927
Everybody make it?

109
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,556
Just Cleon's missing.

110
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:41,017
-Fuzz must've got him.
-Did you see him get busted?

111
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,352
I seen him,
then he wasn't there no more.

112
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:44,896
I was hauling ass.

113
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,981
Why don't you look around,
make sure we're okay.

114
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:48,566
This is a graveyard.

115
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,614
Okay, what are we gonna do now?

116
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,367
We're going back.

117
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,995
You mind telling us how?

118
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:03,956
Fucking Coney Island
must be 50 to 1 00 miles from here.

119
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,043
-It's the only choice we got.
-Yeah, real simple.

120
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:10,296
Except that every cop in the city
is looking to bust our heads.

121
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,840
-We got something else to think about.
-Yeah? What?

122
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:14,717
The truce.

123
00:18:14,801 --> 00:18:16,886
Is it still on?

124
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,805
If it ain't, we're gonna have to bop
our way back.

125
00:18:21,808 --> 00:18:23,643
Shit, I wish we was packed.

126
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:34,654
If this truce is off, anything could
hit us between here and that train.

127
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,489
If you get separated,

128
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,991
make it to the platform at Union Square.

129
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,203
-That's where we change trains.
-I only got one question.

130
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,001
Who named you leader?

131
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:54,507
I got as much right to take over as you.

132
00:18:54,549 --> 00:18:56,759
It was Cleon's choice. Swan's war chief.

133
00:18:56,843 --> 00:19:01,222
Right about now, Cleon's most likely got
a nightstick shoved halfway up his ass.

134
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:05,393
Shit.
I bet you can't even find the subway.

135
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,605
Maybe we ought to talk about this
later, huh?

136
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,149
Well, what's wrong with right now?

137
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,859
I wanna be warlord.

138
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:17,488
Make your move.

139
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,033
-Hey, Ajax, lighten up.
-Big boy, Swan's war chief.

140
00:19:22,202 --> 00:19:24,203
We better stick together.

141
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:30,126
Hey, you guys!
The train's right over there.

142
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,545
Come on. Hurry up. Let's go!

143
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,090
Let's move.

144
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,387
Hey, man, don't worry about it.
Stay loose.

145
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,888
Fuck.

146
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,933
Rembrandt, mark this spot.

147
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,618
Hey! Wait for me!

148
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,463
Riffs!

149
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,632
Yeah, right!

150
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,814
Who are the Warriors?

151
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,496
There must be some word.

152
00:21:35,293 --> 00:21:37,336
I want them all.

153
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:40,005
I want all the Warriors!

154
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,925
I want them alive, if possible.
If not, wasted.

155
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,761
But I want them.

156
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,190
Send the word.

157
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:06,532
All right, now, for all you boppers
out there in the big city,

158
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,368
all you street people
with an ear for the action,

159
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:13,664
I've been asked to relay a request
from the Gramercy Riffs.

160
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,708
It's a special for the Warriors.

161
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,586
That's that real, live bunch from Coney.

162
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,797
And I do mean the Warriors.

163
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,049
Here's a hit with them in mind.

164
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,692
Be looking good, Warriors.

165
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,819
All the way back to Coney.

166
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,030
You hear me, babies?

167
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,991
Good. Real good.

168
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:56,493
Adios.

169
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:11,091
-Come on. What kind of crap is this?
-Yeah. What are we waiting for?

170
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,468
A train would help,

171
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:15,387
unless you wanna go up there
and get japped on an open platform.

172
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,431
Bullshit, man.
There ain't nobody on the street.

173
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:19,892
He's right. We're acting like faggots.

174
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:27,483
Just keep talking.

175
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,874
Move.

176
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,885
That's the Turnbull A.C .'s.

177
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,806
I think they forgot about the truce.

178
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,140
No shit.

179
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:04,269
Those lousy skinheaded fucks.

180
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,080
That's our train. We gotta make it.

181
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,129
Oh, Jesus Christ!

182
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,139
Are we gonna go for it?

183
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,235
Hold the fucking train !

184
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:20,656
Those guys were
some desperate dudes.

185
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:24,201
-So was we!
-In an even fight we could take them.

186
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,745
Bunch of chicken shits!

187
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,081
Those cats didn't look
too chicken shit to me.

188
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,582
Me, neither.

189
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:36,839
Well, we made it.
And in an hour, it is C . I. , the Big Coney.

190
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,633
You got it. Give me that fist, buddy.

191
00:28:39,717 --> 00:28:42,427
When we get there,
that's when we've made it.

192
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,016
Hey, no sweat, war chief.

193
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:51,144
-Hey! I've got Coney Island !
-Yeah !

194
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,605
Figure out how many stops
to the Union Square?

195
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:56,525
Hey, come on, man.
That's high math for Rembrandt.

196
00:28:57,777 --> 00:29:00,028
It's all right.
Nobody can read these maps anyway.

197
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:03,156
Hey, forget it. What's the difference?
We're home free.

198
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,747
We just heard from the Turnbulls.

199
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,791
They blew it.

200
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,896
Shit. This train's had it.

201
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,315
This is fucking impossible.

202
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,067
What the shit are we gonna do?
This sucks.

203
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,819
Why couldn't it rain now?

204
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:44,031
Maybe we ought to worry about
who set that goddamn fire.

205
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,158
Come on.

206
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,229
Yeah.

207
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,856
How are you?

208
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:19,524
I was just checking in.

209
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,320
Yeah, it was a real mess up there.

210
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:27,282
This guy, Cyrus, had an accident.

211
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,869
They did?

212
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,289
Well, that's okay.

213
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,542
These guys, the Warriors.

214
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,796
Yeah, they deserve it.

215
00:30:41,547 --> 00:30:43,048
Yeah, we will.

216
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,842
Take care of yourself.

217
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:52,516
-We set?
-We're set, all right.

218
00:30:52,558 --> 00:30:54,893
Somebody should pick their ass up.

219
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,730
The Riffs sent out the word.
They want them alive. We don't.

220
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,774
The sooner someone grabs them,
the better.

221
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:01,942
What's the matter?

222
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:05,320
You afraid the Warriors gonna shoot
their mouths off before they get racked?

223
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:06,780
Yeah. Right. I'm worried.

224
00:31:06,864 --> 00:31:09,241
-I just don't want the Riffs on my ass.
-No sweat.

225
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,411
They're looking for the Warriors,
remember?

226
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,623
We can do some looking, too.

227
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,584
Ought to make you feel better.

228
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:23,422
Hey.

229
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:26,925
-What about the money you owe?
-For what?

230
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,448
We've had it.

231
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,076
Yeah, I made them.

232
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,661
Two there, one there.

233
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,455
I think they just made us.

234
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,291
You recognize them?

235
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:00,625
Orphans.

236
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:03,003
So far down, they ain't even on the map.

237
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,796
Real low-class.

238
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:08,008
-Numbers?
-Full strength, maybe 30.

239
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,634
Thirty's a lot more than eight.

240
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,804
Not if they're wimps.
And I'm sick of this running crap.

241
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,102
Come on. This way.

242
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,257
Hey.

243
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,303
-You know where that cat's headed.
-Yeah. Reinforcements.

244
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,223
We're gonna get japped here.
We're gonna get japped.

245
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,940
No matter what he says, nobody lip-off.

246
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:08,693
Nobody get hot.
I'm gonna see what I can do.

247
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,446
-When did you turn into a diplomat?
-Yeah.

248
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,324
You ain't exactly
the State Department type.

249
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,034
Fox, you come with me.

250
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:29,089
-You ought to show me your invitation.
-How do you figure?

251
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:34,928
Well, you come armying down here,
invading our territory.

252
00:33:35,012 --> 00:33:37,889
No permits, no parley.

253
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:40,976
We're not invading.
And I'm parleying right now.

254
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,395
We were just at that big meeting
up in the Bronx.

255
00:33:43,437 --> 00:33:44,813
We're going home to Coney.

256
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:48,400
The train gets messed up by the fire
and dumps us here.

257
00:33:48,442 --> 00:33:51,778
I don't know
what you're talking about, man.

258
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:54,531
How could this be a big meeting
if the Orphans wasn't there?

259
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,408
You didn't miss anything.
There was a lot of hassle.

260
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,617
A lot of heads got busted.

261
00:33:57,702 --> 00:34:01,746
You think the Orphans ain't with it?
You think we ain't well-known?

262
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,499
-We didn't say that.
-Well, we got a heavy rep.

263
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,751
You mess with us,
and you'll find that out.

264
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,429
You see that?

265
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,017
They write about our raids in the paper.

266
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,768
Yeah.

267
00:34:25,062 --> 00:34:27,230
That's really heavy.

268
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,940
The Orphans, right?

269
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,444
Yeah, our youth worker,
she talks about you guys all the time.

270
00:34:32,486 --> 00:34:34,112
We ain't got one.

271
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:39,159
That must be because you guys
are so bad, they're afraid of you.

272
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,462
There's nothing wrong with you
making it through our territory,

273
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,464
as long as you're coming in peace.

274
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,646
Cut it, Mercy.

275
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:12,609
You know what that is, don't you?

276
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,319
Yeah.

277
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,695
Trouble.

278
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,330
Those vests are real nice.

279
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,124
Lighten up, Mercy.
Stop looking for trouble now.

280
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,168
I should've slapped your mouth
the minute you opened it.

281
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,711
So who stopped you?

282
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:38,510
Come on. Give me one.

283
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:42,180
Just one.

284
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:46,643
I just want one vest.
You can get another one, man.

285
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,729
No chance.

286
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:59,114
Are you just gonna let an army walk
through here any time they feel like it?

287
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,950
-How's it gonna look?
-Get lost.

288
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,912
You know, pretty soon,
every gang is just gonna boogie right in,

289
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,580
soldier right through.

290
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:11,418
I'll tell you, some man you are.

291
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,136
Take your colors off,
you can walk through.

292
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,309
-We don't do that.
-It's just our mark. It don't mean war.

293
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:28,685
You go as civilians, okay?

294
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,937
Go as soldiers,
I gotta come down on you.

295
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,731
Now take off your colors.

296
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,693
You hear me?

297
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,658
Fuck you.

298
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:02,135
We're not gonna hide who we are just
because some whore shakes her ass.

299
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,887
Don't call me no whore.

300
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:06,264
I ain't no whore!

301
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:09,517
Let's go.

302
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:23,823
We're marching to the next station
through these lame fucks' territory.

303
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,450
Now let's move.

304
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:29,996
Yeah. That's right, Warriors.

305
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,123
Just keep walking.

306
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:35,001
Real tough mothers, ain't you?

307
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,587
You guys don't show me much.

308
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:41,174
Why don't you dickheads just walk
all the way back home?

309
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:49,307
-Boy, that chick's got some mouth.
-You two were really terrific back there.

310
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:53,645
-You guys let them down, but good.
-His ass gonna be ringing for a month.

311
00:37:53,687 --> 00:37:57,148
-I say we should have wasted them.
-Come on. The station's this way.

312
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,272
Let me go! Let me be.

313
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,909
Okay, what do you got in mind?

314
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,413
Well, maybe I'm looking for
some real action.

315
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:38,124
Hey, what about me? I got the big one.

316
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,003
I'll give it to you, baby.

317
00:39:42,087 --> 00:39:43,421
Let her go.

318
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:49,511
You gonna jump me?

319
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,891
Maybe we ought to pull a train on you.
You look like you might even like it.

320
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:57,769
-Fuck you !
-Real tough chick.

321
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,452
You see what you get, Warriors?

322
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,455
You see what you get
when you mess with the Orphans?

323
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,716
We're gonna rain on you, Warriors!

324
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:40,270
-Holy shit!
-Now!

325
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:57,161
-Move, move!
-Where is everybody?

326
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,621
Come on !

327
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,900
Hey, wait a minute.
I gotta ask a question.

328
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,320
How come we're running?

329
00:41:32,072 --> 00:41:34,991
I told you, they're a bunch of wimps.

330
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:37,368
Union Station, here we come.

331
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,203
Hey, what about me?

332
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,961
So, what about you?

333
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:02,226
We got a report from the Bronx.

334
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,979
Some smalltime clique ran into them.

335
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,522
The Orphans.

336
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:09,567
-They're not in our network.
-They rumble anyway.

337
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:12,654
They got wasted.

338
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:24,082
Okay, let's get down to it, boppers.

339
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,292
We're gonna have to do better
out there.

340
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:30,254
Our friends just made it past
one of the minor league teams.

341
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,173
Remember, boppers,

342
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:33,758
be looking good.

343
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,553
All that's going on?

344
00:42:39,807 --> 00:42:41,641
Right. Great.

345
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:43,601
Great.

346
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:45,937
Yeah.

347
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,778
Well?

348
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:57,073
Some two-bit outfit almost got them,
but they bopped their way past.

349
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:01,786
-We can meet them at 96th Street.
-The platform's crawling with cops.

350
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:05,081
Cops are trying to rack up every gang
in this town.

351
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:09,043
-Me and you included.
-How come you're so happy about this?

352
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,130
I'm having a good time.

353
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:15,383
-Let's go!
-All right!

354
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:36,487
How much longer we gotta wait?
We might be here forever.

355
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,157
I'm sick of waiting for trains.

356
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:42,368
Vermin, sit down and shut up.

357
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:43,995
Okay, okay.

358
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,912
-Let's go!
-Where are we going?

359
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,876
Hey, hold it!

360
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:34,545
-Right there.
-Come on.

361
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:37,381
-Hold it.
-Hey.

362
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,971
Take the uptown.

363
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:46,057
-Make it! Make it!
-Move!

364
00:44:46,099 --> 00:44:49,227
-Hey! Move! Move!
-Wait up!

365
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,605
-Come back here!
-Hold it!

366
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,242
Let's double back!

367
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,245
-This way!
-No. Come on. Over here.

368
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:08,996
That way! Go!

369
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,583
-Down the stairs!
-Hurry up.

370
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,257
-The street!
-Far enough, already.

371
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,428
This way.

372
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,764
Oh, shit!

373
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,475
Run !

374
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,477
Just get out of here!

375
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,020
Move!

376
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,149
-God damn you !
-Let go of me!

377
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:57,461
Where are they?

378
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:03,092
-Union Square! Union Square!
-What about the others?

379
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,635
We gotta go!

380
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,637
Keep after them ! Keep on !

381
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:40,838
Maybe we'd better take off.

382
00:46:41,506 --> 00:46:43,007
Yeah. Right.

383
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:12,328
-Did we lose these fucking clowns?
-Look.

384
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,956
Holy shit!

385
00:48:19,604 --> 00:48:21,105
Snow, with me!

386
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,974
Hey!

387
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,119
I can't make it.

388
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:19,789
-Are you sure?
-Yes, I'm sure.

389
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:23,167
Good.
I'm sick of running from these wimps.

390
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:44,688
I'm gonna shove that bat up your ass
and turn you into a Popsicle.

391
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,898
Come on.

392
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,708
-Fucking-A.
-Hey!

393
00:51:02,475 --> 00:51:03,851
Come on, Cowboy.

394
00:51:13,320 --> 00:51:15,404
Shit, I figured they were wimps.

395
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,661
The latest sports news
off the street, boppers.

396
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,457
The Baseball Furies dropped the ball,
made an error.

397
00:51:26,499 --> 00:51:30,961
Our friends are on second base and
trying to make it all the way home.

398
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,673
But the inside word is
that the odds are against them.

399
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,218
Stay tuned, boppers.

400
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:38,761
Stay tuned.

401
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,829
-Where is everybody?
-Looks like we're the first ones here.

402
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,749
We're just gonna have to sit and wait.

403
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,751
They'll show up.

404
00:52:10,835 --> 00:52:13,963
Looks like something else showed up.

405
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,756
Well, hey, hey, hey.

406
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:19,093
Now look at what you find here
in the big city.

407
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,971
-Hey, you guys. We ain't got time.
-Are you kidding?

408
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,431
Time's what we got plenty of.

409
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,695
Hi.

410
00:52:53,545 --> 00:53:21,989
Hey.

411
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,411
I guess she don't know
that parks ain't safe after dark.

412
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:29,330
We ain't got time for this right now.

413
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,541
We've got to get to Union Square.

414
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:36,295
You go ahead if you want.
I'm gonna get a little exercise.

415
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:38,422
You never were very smart.

416
00:53:39,924 --> 00:53:42,217
I'll tell you something, warlord.

417
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:44,053
I'm smart enough.

418
00:53:44,095 --> 00:53:46,096
And it's there for free.

419
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:47,681
You two coming?

420
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:52,311
-Come on, man.
-There's plenty of women back home.

421
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:56,815
Maybe all of you just going faggot.

422
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:15,751
You feeling all right, lady?

423
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,295
You need a little help or something?

424
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:21,048
Why don't you sit down?
Keep me company.

425
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,221
Whatever you say, lady.

426
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,850
Look at those muscles.

427
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:34,645
I bet the chicks like all those muscles.

428
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,115
Hey.

429
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,994
We better go back and look out for him.

430
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,249
He saved my ass back there.

431
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:56,667
I owe him.

432
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,129
Okay, I'll go look for the others.

433
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:14,017
You wanna show me
how you play with the chicks?

434
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,229
Yeah.

435
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:21,859
-I'll show you how I play.
-Hey!

436
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:24,278
Not so rough. Come on.

437
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:28,157
-We'll get it on.
-You don't get it. I like it rough.

438
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:43,255
Your nights in the park
are over for a while, honey.

439
00:55:43,339 --> 00:55:45,591
-You're under arrest.
-Hey, lady.

440
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,176
Come on, lady.

441
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,470
Kiss my ass.

442
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,640
Come on, lady.

443
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,190
Come on. Quit playing around.
You don't wanna play around with me!

444
00:56:05,069 --> 00:56:07,029
Let me out of this thing !

445
00:56:07,071 --> 00:56:08,322
You hear me?

446
00:56:13,703 --> 00:56:16,538
God damn it! Let me go!

447
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,919
Let me go!

448
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:26,882
You can't do this to me!
Come on, you lousy bitch !

449
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,660
Fucking wimp.

450
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,077
Hey, wait!

451
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:43,584
There's still cops all over the place.

452
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,796
Where's the Fox?

453
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,506
A cop grabbed him.

454
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:53,135
So how come you hung around?

455
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:57,139
I don't know.

456
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:01,810
-Where did you get the coat?
-You ask a lot of questions.

457
00:58:01,853 --> 00:58:03,604
Don't give me that.

458
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,150
I stole it.

459
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:11,820
Cops are looking for
somebody in a pink top.

460
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,989
Real tough chick.

461
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,199
Right. You said that before.

462
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:23,248
If you still wanna get to Union Square,
I can show you where to grab the train.

463
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,000
Okay.

464
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:26,376
Come on.

465
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:30,756
Hey.

466
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,765
Hey!

467
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,278
-What is that?
-Hold it!

468
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,280
-Freeze!
-Go on.

469
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,657
Move it!

470
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,492
-Jesus!
-Come on !

471
00:59:40,576 --> 00:59:42,035
Run !

472
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,473
Is this the place?

473
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:09,062
Hey, I hate asking the questions,
but where's the dudes?

474
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:11,273
Chicks like you
always got dudes around.

475
01:00:11,315 --> 01:00:14,276
They took the night off.
Went up to the Bronx.

476
01:00:14,318 --> 01:00:16,153
Don't worry about them.

477
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:19,072
They're lame, real cripples.

478
01:00:29,333 --> 01:00:30,876
Come on.

479
01:00:34,505 --> 01:00:37,132
When I got off that subway
and I saw you, I thought,

480
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:39,009
"Oh, baby, throw it my way."

481
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:41,762
I mean, it's really great of you chicks
taking us in like this.

482
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:44,055
We know about the Warriors.
You're a heavy outfit.

483
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,891
Sure, we know you about you guys.

484
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,186
-How'd you hear about us?
-You know how it is. Word gets around.

485
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:54,357
-I guess we are pretty well-known.
-Come on.

486
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:28,266
You know, you're the first friendly faces
we've seen all night.

487
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:29,893
That's the way we are.

488
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,479
Let's party a little. Get something going.

489
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:37,150
-Yeah, sure. Hey, I can dig that.
-Hey, you came to the right guys.

490
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,238
Oh, hurt me, hurt me.

491
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,741
Don't thank us, man. Just relax.

492
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:46,618
Fall out.

493
01:01:46,702 --> 01:01:48,370
Take your pick.

494
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:59,381
Thanks. This is a great outfit.

495
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:02,092
-What clique is this?
-We're the Lizzies.

496
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,470
Lizzies. Hey, great.

497
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:08,014
Just great. I like that. I like it.

498
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,683
Glad to hear it.

499
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:16,314
Man, we got to come
to this part of town more often.

500
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:17,983
Yeah, right.

501
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,821
That's right. Got to.

502
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,326
Thanks a lot.

503
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:35,292
-Looks like you're the winner.
-Yeah, right.

504
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:48,013
How much longer
are we gonna hang around here?

505
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,975
-What's your hurry? We just got here.
-We ought to get to Union Square.

506
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:55,687
-They're gonna be worried about us.
-Yeah, sure. In a minute.

507
01:02:55,771 --> 01:02:57,772
A little break in the action.

508
01:03:26,010 --> 01:03:27,218
Can we stop for a minute?

509
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:30,847
I'm sick of this crap.
My legs are getting tired.

510
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:34,100
-Come on. Just keep walking.
-Well, what's your hurry?

511
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:37,228
Trying to set some kind of
a world record or something?

512
01:03:42,902 --> 01:03:43,985
Hey.

513
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,535
-Just walk.
-I'm walking.

514
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:55,246
Jesus, why don't you give me a break?

515
01:03:56,874 --> 01:04:00,293
Be a little friendly.
I don't even know your name.

516
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,920
My name's Swan.

517
01:04:03,214 --> 01:04:05,966
What do you care about names
so much for?

518
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:09,052
I like telling my friends
I been with somebody particular.

519
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:10,887
You know what I mean?

520
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:14,057
Why don't you just tie a mattress
to your back?

521
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,894
You don't care where it is, do you?

522
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:22,148
Look, what do you got against me?
You've been picking on me all night.

523
01:04:22,233 --> 01:04:24,359
You want me to tell you the truth?

524
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,111
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

525
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,154
I don't like the way you live.

526
01:04:29,156 --> 01:04:31,241
-The way I live?
-Yeah.

527
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:34,744
I keep hoping I'm gonna
run into something a little better.

528
01:04:34,829 --> 01:04:37,414
What kind of crap is this?

529
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:39,624
Who are you?
You ain't any better than me.

530
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,043
I guess you like the way
everything's going for you.

531
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,837
Well, maybe I do.

532
01:04:43,921 --> 01:04:47,257
Friday nights are pretty good.
Saturday nights are better.

533
01:04:47,299 --> 01:04:50,677
I don't think you can remember who
you get on Friday and Saturday night.

534
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,013
I don't think you can remember
what they look like.

535
01:04:53,097 --> 01:04:56,099
Sometimes I can,
and sometimes I can't.

536
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:57,767
Who gives a damn?

537
01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:02,689
I see what's happening next door
and down the block,

538
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,650
belly hanging down, five kids,

539
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:07,569
cockroaches in the cupboard.

540
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,489
I'll tell you what I want.

541
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,200
I want something now.

542
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:18,246
This is the life I got left.
You know what I mean?

543
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,624
You get it, Warrior?

544
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:24,753
Get it?

545
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:43,855
How do you like it?

546
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:29,859
Come on. What's wrong?

547
01:06:29,944 --> 01:06:32,821
Let's just get to the next station, okay?

548
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:35,198
No.

549
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,908
Please?

550
01:06:36,992 --> 01:06:40,328
Come on.

551
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:46,334
You're just part of everything that's
happening tonight, and it's all bad.

552
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:53,258
Just go back
to wherever it was you came from.

553
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:42,557
Hey, little man, you wanna dance?

554
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:22,430
I'll be right with you, babe.

555
01:08:36,987 --> 01:08:40,657
So you're the famous Warriors,
the guys that shot Cyrus.

556
01:08:40,699 --> 01:08:43,660
Shit! The chicks are packed.
The chicks are packed !

557
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:45,870
Shit!

558
01:09:13,565 --> 01:09:14,857
Shit.

559
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,790
She cut me. She cut me.

560
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:33,126
Look. Look, man.

561
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:36,838
Now we gotta hold ourselves together.
We got to.

562
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:41,259
See, man, now if we go to pieces,
somebody out there's gonna get us.

563
01:09:41,343 --> 01:09:43,803
They think we shot Cyrus.

564
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:45,596
What are you talking about?
I don't get it.

565
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:47,390
They think we shot Cyrus.

566
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,101
Every gang in this city
must be looking for us.

567
01:09:50,185 --> 01:09:51,519
Holy shit!

568
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,565
We're not gonna be able
to make it back.

569
01:09:55,607 --> 01:09:57,233
We're gonna make it back.

570
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,944
We came this far.
We'll go the rest of the way.

571
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,281
Let's go to Union Square, okay?
We gotta tell the rest of the guys.

572
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:20,209
Hey.

573
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,421
Where's the rest of them?

574
01:12:25,591 --> 01:12:27,008
Yeah, right.

575
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,476
Where's everybody else?

576
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,396
Cops got Ajax.
We don't know about Swan.

577
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:44,358
-Oh, Jesus!
-Are you sure about Ajax?

578
01:12:44,401 --> 01:12:45,985
Real sure.

579
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:49,989
I bet he went out swinging.

580
01:12:50,073 --> 01:12:52,158
We better go look for Swan.

581
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,413
God, I can't believe it.

582
01:12:57,498 --> 01:12:59,540
Yeah. What is this shit?

583
01:13:24,441 --> 01:13:26,317
I need to talk to you.

584
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:30,363
See that dude over there
with the skates?

585
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:33,991
Over there.

586
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:37,787
He's after you.
And he's got some guys with him.

587
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:42,833
I know they're on my ass.

588
01:13:47,965 --> 01:13:50,132
But now they know I know it.

589
01:13:51,468 --> 01:13:53,636
Well, what are you gonna do?

590
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:30,339
Come on.

591
01:14:30,382 --> 01:14:33,467
You sure change your mind fast.

592
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:37,263
-I was kind of rough on you back there.
-Listen, I can take care of myself.

593
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,015
Sure. Come on.

594
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:50,276
Wait a minute. I can't go in there.

595
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:52,028
It's a men's room.

596
01:14:53,238 --> 01:14:54,697
Are you kidding?

597
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:45,558
Get him !

598
01:18:20,111 --> 01:18:23,364
-What about our patrols?
-So far, nothing.

599
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:28,244
But we've got somebody here
you ought to talk to.

600
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,538
He says he saw who shot Cyrus.

601
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:53,602
Big Cyrus, he was gonna
run the whole city.

602
01:18:53,687 --> 01:18:56,272
What crap that was.

603
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:59,441
Cyrus was right about one thing.

604
01:18:59,484 --> 01:19:02,236
It's all out there.

605
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,489
All we gotta do is just
figure out a way to go steal it.

606
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,949
Sounds great.

607
01:19:07,033 --> 01:19:10,411
All you gotta do is figure out
what's worth stealing.

608
01:19:36,062 --> 01:19:38,022
Okay, come on. Let's go.

609
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:43,402
Come on, let me get some breakfast
or something.

610
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:53,681
-Let's get off here.
-Yeah.

611
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:11,633
What's this for?

612
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,471
I just hate seeing anything go to waste.

613
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:29,193
This is what we fought all night
to get back to?

614
01:22:32,155 --> 01:22:34,156
Maybe I'll just take off.

615
01:22:35,658 --> 01:22:38,160
Well, you know I like traveling, too.

616
01:22:39,204 --> 01:22:41,205
Where have you ever been?

617
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,500
I never been anywhere.

618
01:22:44,584 --> 01:22:46,543
I just know I'd like it.

619
01:22:50,215 --> 01:22:51,882
Come on. Let's go.

620
01:23:31,798 --> 01:23:34,716
Stay right on their ass.

621
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:56,655
Wait a couple seconds after we move,
then cut out the other way.

622
01:23:56,739 --> 01:23:59,449
-Why can't I stay with you?
-Just do what I tell you.

623
01:23:59,534 --> 01:24:01,827
-Okay?
-Come on.

624
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:04,496
I can take care of myself.

625
01:24:04,581 --> 01:24:06,081
I proved that.

626
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,376
Come on.

627
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:08,143
Warriors.

628
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:12,481
Come out to play.

629
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:15,525
Warriors.

630
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:20,155
Come out to play.

631
01:25:21,157 --> 01:25:23,158
Warriors.

632
01:25:23,201 --> 01:25:27,704
Come out to play.

633
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:29,790
Warriors.

634
01:25:29,832 --> 01:25:34,294
Come out to play.

635
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:36,171
Warriors.

636
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:40,425
Come out to play!

637
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,596
Everybody packed?

638
01:25:46,057 --> 01:25:47,349
Yeah.

639
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:53,188
All of you stay behind me.
I'm gonna take them out to the sand.

640
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:55,274
What about you? You ready?

641
01:25:59,862 --> 01:26:01,238
Let's do it.

642
01:27:08,806 --> 01:27:13,060
When we see the ocean,
we figure we're home, we're safe.

643
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,021
This time, you got it wrong.

644
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:21,818
Why did you do it?

645
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:24,196
Why did you waste Cyrus?

646
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,614
No reason.

647
01:27:27,116 --> 01:27:30,077
I just like doing things like that.

648
01:27:36,542 --> 01:27:39,836
Let's do it, me and you.

649
01:27:39,921 --> 01:27:42,214
One on one?

650
01:27:42,298 --> 01:27:43,757
You're crazy.

651
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,471
You're dead.

652
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:52,265
All of you, and you know it.

653
01:27:54,018 --> 01:27:55,769
-You're dead.
-Swan !

654
01:28:24,006 --> 01:28:26,466
-Riffs!
-Yeah, right!

655
01:28:55,121 --> 01:28:57,122
You still looking for us?

656
01:28:59,500 --> 01:29:01,960
We found what we're looking for.

657
01:29:03,379 --> 01:29:05,505
No.

658
01:29:05,548 --> 01:29:07,674


659
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:09,759
It wasn't us.

660
01:29:09,844 --> 01:29:12,721
It was them, the Warriors.

661
01:29:14,098 --> 01:29:15,974
You Warriors are good.

662
01:29:17,268 --> 01:29:18,602
Real good.

663
01:29:21,314 --> 01:29:22,564
The best.

664
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,817
The rest is ours.

665
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:59,559
No!

666
01:30:01,812 --> 01:30:05,649
Good news, boppers.
The big alert has been called off.

667
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:10,362
It turns out that the early reports
were wrong, all wrong.

668
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:14,908
Now for that group out there
that had such a hard time getting home,

669
01:30:14,951 --> 01:30:16,868
sorry about that.

670
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:20,247
I guess the only thing we can do
is play you a song.
