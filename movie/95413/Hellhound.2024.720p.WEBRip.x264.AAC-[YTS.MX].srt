00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,235
[Loreno] Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

10

Better late than never, my son.

15
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:33,187
[Father] The Lord shows patience
to those who sinned.

16
00:02:33,854 --> 00:02:35,189
Would you like to tell me

17
00:02:35,789 --> 00:02:37,191
What is troubling you?

18
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,398
[Loreno] Well, you see, Father,

19
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,501
I've been an evil
man for so long,

20
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:50,804
I'm scared my sins are too great
to be forgiven.

21
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,674

Please continue.

24
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,251
[Loreno] I was 14 years old

But you know, Father...

28
00:03:16,264 --> 00:03:18,198
It's a hard thing to stab a man

29
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,337
[Children screaming] Shooting
someone's completely different.

it's easy.

33
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,479
But when you stab a man,

34
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,681
Now, that's different.

through the muscle.

Why are you telling me this?

50
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:11,251
[Loreno] Do you believe
in hell, Father?

51
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,254
Do you believe that all sinners

52
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,557
will burn in an eternal fire?

53
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:19,493

I believe in that.

He's just another
"Lonely Jumper."

130
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:37,671
Lonely Jumper?

131
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,406
[Cetan] As they call them.

132
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,675
There's two types, actually.

133
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:43,677
Head-first.

134
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:45,445
And feet-first.

135
00:10:46,213 --> 00:10:48,248
[Cetan] Usually, the
feet-first jumper

136

also have their hands
tied behind their back.

137
00:10:52,052 --> 00:10:53,353
I'm guessing our guy
is the last type?

Not according to the police.

139
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,659

She doesn't buy
the bullshit suicide story.

So, she comes to Thailand.

144
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:15,042
And find the girlfriend living
in her dad's condominium.

145
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,343
With a new boyfriend.

146
00:11:17,144 --> 00:11:17,845

00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:39,967
And the girlfriend is Nill.

158
00:11:40,934 --> 00:11:42,369
[Cetan] She's also
a part of the deal.

159

everything you need.

00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:13,852
And new ones.

375
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:21,092
We were in a job, Paul.

376
00:39:22,894 --> 00:39:24,496
[Loreno] Officially,
it's my last job.

377
00:39:25,564 --> 00:39:26,565
[Paul clears his throat]

378
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:28,900
[Loreno] But I need you
to help me find someone.

379
00:39:31,269 --> 00:39:32,471
This guy right here.

380
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,408
You know him?

381
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,544
[Loreno] I need to find him.

382
00:39:39,845 --> 00:39:40,512
And I mean.

383
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,114
I really need to find him.

384
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:47,118
That's a face I've seen before.

385
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,325
You want to know the real reason

386
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:55,727
I run that circus upstairs?

387
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,432
The reason is...

388
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:02,601
I admire those fighters.

389
00:40:04,369 --> 00:40:05,103
[Paul] I love them.

390
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,405
Violence...

391
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:11,109
is a fundamental part
of the individual.

392
00:40:12,277 --> 00:40:13,545
If we look at nature.

393
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,614
Chimps, for example.

394
00:40:16,548 --> 00:40:17,716
Violence in the
sense of killing is

395
00:40:17,749 --> 00:40:19,585
very much associated
with the group.

396
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,620
And the reason is.

397
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,090
The individual doesn't benefit

398
00:40:25,123 --> 00:40:26,324
by getting into a fight

399
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:28,527
in which they risk
being hurt themselves.

400
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:32,464
[Paul continues] It's only when
they have overwhelming power.

401
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:34,633
That the temptation
to try to kill another

402
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:37,102
individual arises sufficiently

403
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,538
for them to be able to do it.

404
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:42,708
[Paul] The number
of chimpanzee males

405
00:40:43,709 --> 00:40:45,544
that attack a single
male is eight to one.

406
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,647
Eight to one.

407
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:51,483
[Paul continues] Now you take
your average man he's...

408
00:40:52,117 --> 00:40:52,584
walking down the street

409
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:54,553
hand in hand with his
pretty girlfriend.

410
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,588
And they walk by some bad guys.

411
00:40:57,255 --> 00:40:58,557
And the bad guys...

412
00:40:59,257 --> 00:41:00,025
compliment his girl's ass.

413
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:02,093
[Paul] Now your average man

414
00:41:03,328 --> 00:41:04,863
would prefer to let it go.

415
00:41:06,565 --> 00:41:07,899
He will lie to himself.

416
00:41:09,568 --> 00:41:11,302
In order to justify his fear of

417
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:13,539
taking action under
the circumstance

418
00:41:13,572 --> 00:41:16,074
of good social behavior.

419
00:41:17,442 --> 00:41:19,778
But now you take
that very same guy.

420
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:23,214
And you put him in
a riot against the police.

421
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,252
And he can't help but
kick and smash and punch

422
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,654
everything around him.

423
00:41:29,588 --> 00:41:31,523
Now that he's not alone anymore,

424
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,760
all social prevention is gone.

425
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:36,762
And he becomes dangerous.

426
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:40,331
What, have you become the
fucking philosopher now Paul?

427
00:41:40,365 --> 00:41:41,733
[Paul chuckles]

428
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:43,635
[Paul] What I'm
trying to say is.

429
00:41:46,237 --> 00:41:47,606
There are three types of man.

430
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:50,241
Ordinary man,

431
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:51,743
fearful.

432
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,511
Brave man,

433
00:41:53,845 --> 00:41:54,279
fighter.

434
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:57,015
And lastly the
third type of man.

435
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,417
A man so determined

436
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,620
to transcend human nature.

437
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:06,124
[Slightly whispers]
He embraces violence.

438
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:09,527
[Paul] A man like you.

439
00:42:10,629 --> 00:42:12,263
Or me if you prefer.

440
00:42:14,099 --> 00:42:16,534
[Paul] Now, I don't know what
you want from this guy.

441
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,571
But I can guess.

442
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,272
Since we're friends,

443
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:23,008
I'll help you.

444
00:42:24,442 --> 00:42:25,877
Come back tomorrow,

445
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:27,613
I'll see what kind of
information I can gather.

446
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,253
Nice to see you, Paul.

447
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:44,630
[Somsak, in English]
Your friend, he crazy.

448
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,331
I don't understand
what he's saying.

449
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,566
[Loreno] He was a lot
worse than crazy, pal.

450
00:42:49,534 --> 00:42:52,303
You see, he's what
we call a sociopath.

451
00:42:53,471 --> 00:42:54,572
Right now we need
him as a friend.

452
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:57,809
Did you see his reaction

453
00:42:57,843 --> 00:42:59,177
when he took a look
at that photograph?

454
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,312
He knew exactly who he was.

455
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:04,616
You trust him?

456
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,320
I don't trust anybody.

457
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:13,892

[Loreno] We got
fucking lucky, pal.

558
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:29,600
We got lucky, okay?

559
00:59:30,467 --> 00:59:32,336
You try not to
fucking die on me.

560
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:33,771
You can die later.

561
00:59:33,804 --> 00:59:34,071
Hey!

562
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:35,606
[Loreno] you can die later.

563
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,144
[Intense knocking]

564
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:46,617
[Paul] How bad is it?

565
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:47,351
Bad.

566
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:49,319
Call the doctor,
tell him it's urgent.

567
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,554
[Bodyguard] It's late, he sleep!

568
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:52,322
I don't give a shit if
he's asleep. Wake him up.

569
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:53,557
Put him down.

570
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:54,692
[Paul] Put him down.

571
00:59:56,827 --> 00:59:59,329
[Slow dramatic
orchestra playing]

572
01:00:00,364 --> 01:00:01,131
[Loreno] Just breathe.

573
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:02,867
Fuck.

574
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,601
[Loreno] He's alive

575
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:05,169
and I'm not sure
for how much longer.

576
01:00:06,871 --> 01:00:08,806
Looks like your guy
found you first.

577
01:00:10,440 --> 01:00:11,141
Yeah.

578
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:13,143
But he's a dead man walking.

579
01:00:14,478 --> 01:00:15,946
About that, I've got some
good news for you.

580
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:19,684
The doctor is on the way.

581
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,759
[Loreno] So you
know where he is?

582
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:30,327
[Paul] No, I don't
know where he is.

583
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:32,062
But I know something better.

584
01:00:32,663 --> 01:00:33,263
I know where he will be.

585
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:36,767
And?

586
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:38,368
And...

587
01:00:41,571 --> 01:00:43,273
Why don't you just
drop it this time?

588
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:47,912
[Paul] I've been there too.

589
01:00:48,578 --> 01:00:50,280
Sometimes you cannot win.

590
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:52,649
It would help a lot

591
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,384
You could let it go.

592
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:57,421
[Paul] It's only a job.

593
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:58,956
Nothing personal.

594
01:01:01,325 --> 01:01:02,659
Your man is fucked up in there.

595
01:01:04,729 --> 01:01:05,963
[Paul] And you're left alone

596
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:07,765
to face that other
guy and his friends.

597
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:10,400
Well.

598
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:14,671
I can tell you I'm
done after this, Paul.

599
01:01:15,773 --> 01:01:17,274
[Loreno] I'm officially done.

600
01:01:19,243 --> 01:01:21,912
But this is going to
be my grand finale.

601
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:28,452
I knew I couldn't
talk you out of it.

602
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,791
[Paul continues] Well,

603
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:36,393
there's a fight
night coming soon.

604
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,428
Big money.

605
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:41,298
[Paul] Your man
placed a big bet.

606
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,367
He'll be there to enjoy the show

607
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,335
and check on his investment.

608
01:01:47,938 --> 01:01:49,373
I guess I'm gonna be there too?

609
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:17,367
[Doctor] He's lost
a lot of blood.

610
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,052
[Doctor] This man is dying.

611
01:02:35,986 --> 01:02:37,387
You have to get him
to the hospital.

612
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:39,156
[Paul] You sure?

613
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:41,358
[Doctor] Yes,

614
01:02:42,292 --> 01:02:43,127
I'm sure, sir.

615
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:44,394
I mean, look at him.

616
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:48,799
[Doctor] He's going
into cardiac arrest.

617
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:55,205
[Doctor] You got it!

618
01:02:57,975 --> 01:02:59,309
Call the ambulance now!

619
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,079
[Doctor] Or you're
gonna lose him!

620
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:05,049
[Doctor] Come on!

621
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:06,083
[Doctor struggling]

622
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:14,524
[Doctor Whispers]
Come on!

623
01:03:14,658 --> 01:03:15,359
Come on! you can...

624
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:19,396
[Doctor out of breathe]

625
01:03:26,603 --> 01:03:27,337
Okay.

626
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:29,940
You don't need to
do anything now.

627
01:03:30,875 --> 01:03:31,508
[Doctor] He's gone.

628
01:03:37,481 --> 01:03:39,083
[Emotional music starts playing]

629
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:52,496
[Paul] He died badly.

630
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,167
Yeah, he did.

631
01:03:59,436 --> 01:04:00,170
What are you gonna do?

632
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:31,635
[Loreno] Whiskey?

633
01:04:32,436 --> 01:04:33,170
Coffee, please.

634
01:04:39,109 --> 01:04:41,611
I have forgotten the
stink of this city.

635
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:44,714
[Cetan] I promised myself

636
01:04:44,748 --> 01:04:47,184
never to set foot in this place.

637
01:04:48,352 --> 01:04:50,087
And yet here I am.

638
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:53,190
I must blame you for that.

639
01:04:55,425 --> 01:04:56,493
[Cetan] You're slipping.

640
01:04:57,327 --> 01:04:59,096
You have the right to blame me.

641
01:04:59,930 --> 01:05:01,098
Obviously,

642
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:04,101
I cannot blame the poor boy.

643
01:05:05,202 --> 01:05:07,471
His mama entrusted me with him.

644
01:05:08,939 --> 01:05:10,374
And I feel responsible.

645
01:05:13,443 --> 01:05:16,947
[Loreno] You telling me
getting old has made you
sentimental all of a sudden.

646
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:21,085
Any excuse is good for vendetta.

647
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:23,487
Now I recognize you.

648
01:05:26,123 --> 01:05:26,957
So.

649
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,626
Soon we'll get to
see your old friend.

650
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,197
[Loreno] I'm sure he'll
be happy to see you.

651
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,200
Happy to see me?

652
01:05:40,137 --> 01:05:43,340
I also don't relish
the idea of seeing.

653
01:05:44,141 --> 01:05:46,210
But if this is what you want.

654
01:05:47,444 --> 01:05:48,979
We would do it your way.

655
01:05:51,415 --> 01:05:52,649
It's necessary.

656
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:55,785
It's been many years

657
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:58,355
since the last time
we worked together.

658
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:00,524
[Dark music plays]

659
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:03,327
[Cetan] We were on an
assignment in Cambod

660
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:08,198
We snuck inside this house.

661
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:11,968
A beautiful villa.

662
01:06:14,471 --> 01:06:16,106
And our targets?

663
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:19,643
A married couple, are
serenely watching TV

664
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,511
on the sofa with their child.

665
01:06:22,246 --> 01:06:25,449
[Dark music continues]

666
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,352
[Cetan] The little
boy first saw us.

667
01:06:30,787 --> 01:06:32,189
I still remember

668
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:36,126
how he looked at me and my gun.

669
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:40,630
[Dark music continues]

670
01:06:41,565 --> 01:06:42,232
He didn't flinch.

671
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:45,402
[Cetan] Like he
didn't know fear.

672
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:50,207
But the parents were less brave.

673
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:56,980
The mother began to beg and cry.

674
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:59,083
And the father pissed his pants.

675
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:03,320
[Dark music continues]

676
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:06,890
[Cetan] Paul then
lined them up and asked

677
01:07:06,923 --> 01:07:08,792
how much they loved their child.

678
01:07:10,460 --> 01:07:14,264
And then he forced
the boy to tell him

679
01:07:15,165 --> 01:07:17,234
who he loved more.

680
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:22,639
Mommy or Daddy?

681
01:07:24,641 --> 01:07:26,343
And to choose one of them.

682
01:07:29,279 --> 01:07:32,216
The boy resisted as
long as he could.

683
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:34,651
In the end,

684
01:07:37,154 --> 01:07:38,788
he choose Mother.

685
01:07:43,527 --> 01:07:44,794
Paul shot her first.

686
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:48,532
Her brain ended up
on the curtains.

687
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:52,369
Then he killed the father.

688
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:56,506
The boy was so scared.

689
01:07:57,974 --> 01:08:01,511
[Cetan] He couldn't
stand to look at Paul

690
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:03,480
So he kept...

691
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,417
staring at me, begging for help.

692
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:11,655
I couldn't stand to
look at him anymore.

693
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:18,562
So I put a bullet
between his eyes.

694
01:08:19,329 --> 01:08:23,167
[Dark music continues]

695
01:08:25,202 --> 01:08:27,204
[Dark music fades to silence]

696
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:28,705
You know the rest of the story.

697
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,409
Yeah

698
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,513
I know who he was.

699
01:08:37,181 --> 01:08:38,582
And I know who he is.

700
01:08:39,283 --> 01:08:40,450
That doesn't matter.

701
01:08:41,385 --> 01:08:42,752
Because this isn't
a job anymore.

702
01:08:42,786 --> 01:08:44,388
It's turned into a war.

703
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:46,456
[Loreno] And he's our ally

704
01:08:47,524 --> 01:08:48,492
for the moment.

705
01:08:49,193 --> 01:08:53,230
[Loud ambient sound fades in]

706
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:06,142
[Loud ambient rumble]

707
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:08,845
[Door unlocks]

708
01:09:59,963 --> 01:10:01,565
[Noi sobbing]

709
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,691
[Screams]

710
01:10:30,327 --> 01:10:33,297
[Continues crying]

711
01:10:42,872 --> 01:10:46,443
[Paul] When people sense death
coming, they have a last burst.

712
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:51,080
Is that why you're here?

713
01:10:51,114 --> 01:10:51,681
You fucker.

714
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,487
I'm surprised you
are still alive.

715
01:11:01,691 --> 01:11:04,561
The devil always
looks after his own.

716
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:07,731
[Loreno] Wow.

717
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:10,300
Have a look at you two
together again, yeah?

718
01:11:11,868 --> 01:11:12,869
[Loreno] Got confirmation?

719
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:13,737
I do.

720
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:15,439
He'll be there.

721
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:16,473
Fight's set.

722
01:11:17,407 --> 01:11:17,607
[Paul] I'll Have
my guy pick you up.

723
01:11:18,808 --> 01:11:20,577
Tell us a little more
about the location, Paul.

724
01:11:21,445 --> 01:11:23,012
Location is called the Ditch.

725
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:24,681
It's been there for decades.

726
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:26,450
Started during the Vietnam War.

727
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,486
Unlike anything you've
ever seen before.

728
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,555
How is the security there?

729
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,823
[Paul] Just a couple of guys.

730
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:36,426
You know, to make sure
nobody's causing trouble.

731
01:11:39,262 --> 01:11:40,897
Tar will have his guys with him.

732
01:11:41,498 --> 01:11:42,466
It won't be a problem.

733
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,701
[Cetan] Will they check
us at the entrance

734
01:11:45,969 --> 01:11:46,570
No, they won't.

735
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:52,609
I just have one request for you.

736
01:11:53,543 --> 01:11:54,444
[Paul] Wait till
the fight's finished

737
01:11:54,478 --> 01:11:55,845
before you make your move.

738
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,816
I placed a very

[chopping]

927
01:34:22,958 --> 01:34:24,292
We've been waiting for you.

928
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:28,163
[Julia] It is not
easy to climb up here.

929
01:34:31,433 --> 01:34:32,267
I know it well.

930
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:34,903
[Loreno] But hey,

931
01:34:36,304 --> 01:34:36,939
you made it.

932
01:34:41,977 --> 01:34:43,445
Please, let's go
inside and talk.

933
01:34:43,478 --> 01:34:44,279
After you,

934
01:34:45,147 --> 01:34:46,148
right this way.

935
01:34:50,385 --> 01:34:51,854
[Julia] I wanted to thank you

936
01:34:52,487 --> 01:34:53,255
for what you have done.

937
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:54,289
I, I...

938
01:34:54,556 --> 01:34:55,690
[Julia continues]
I mean...

939
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:57,793
to have avenged my father.

940
01:35:00,362 --> 01:35:00,963
And...

941
01:35:04,867 --> 01:35:06,434
I'm very sorry...

942
01:35:07,435 --> 01:35:08,937
for what happened to Cetan.

943
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,841
[Julia continues] So... I am...

944
01:35:13,608 --> 01:35:15,911
bringing you the final payment.

945
01:35:16,611 --> 01:35:19,281
And I have doubled the amount.

946
01:35:21,984 --> 01:35:23,451
What does it mean to you?

947
01:35:26,088 --> 01:35:28,423
All this money, what
does it mean to you?

948
01:35:29,892 --> 01:35:32,194
I don't understand.

949
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:34,196
It's your money.

950
01:35:34,963 --> 01:35:36,331
[Slow emotional cellos playing]

951
01:35:36,364 --> 01:35:37,432
You're a very brave woman

952
01:35:37,465 --> 01:35:39,367
coming out here to see me alone.

953
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:44,072
But, you should be
afraid of men like me.

954
01:35:44,907 --> 01:35:46,842
[Slow emotional cellos continue]

955
01:35:48,877 --> 01:35:50,278
But I had to come.

956
01:35:50,312 --> 01:35:51,179
I mean...

957
01:35:51,213 --> 01:35:53,048
that was the
agreement with Cetan.

958
01:36:00,622 --> 01:36:01,323
Look.

959
01:36:04,459 --> 01:36:07,162
I pray to God every day

960
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:08,964
to help me get...

961
01:36:09,631 --> 01:36:10,933
justice.

962
01:36:11,967 --> 01:36:14,469
And finally, he listened to me.

963
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:19,074
God?

964
01:36:19,374 --> 01:36:20,208
Yes.

965
01:36:22,444 --> 01:36:23,812
He listens to you?

966
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:26,348
Yes.

967
01:36:30,618 --> 01:36:32,420
Sometimes I wonder,
if God's up there,

968
01:36:32,454 --> 01:36:33,956
why doesn't he stop me?

969
01:36:37,425 --> 01:36:38,560
Why doesn't he stop me

970
01:36:38,593 --> 01:36:40,362
doing the things I do?

971
01:36:41,363 --> 01:36:43,565
Why doesn't he reach
down through the cloud

972
01:36:43,598 --> 01:36:45,500
with his Godlike
hand and stop...

973
01:36:46,601 --> 01:36:47,502
All the bullets?

974
01:36:48,470 --> 01:36:49,104
Why?

975
01:36:51,773 --> 01:36:53,808
[Loreno] And
because he does not.

976
01:36:55,443 --> 01:36:57,312
Isn't he partly to blame?

977
01:36:58,881 --> 01:37:00,482
Isn't he partly guilty?

978
01:37:03,451 --> 01:37:04,219
[Loreno] And you?

979
01:37:10,025 --> 01:37:12,427
God recognizes evil.

980
01:37:14,396 --> 01:37:16,164
Oh, he does?

981
01:37:16,598 --> 01:37:17,165
[Julia] Yes.

982
01:37:19,634 --> 01:37:21,069
Okay, then.

983
01:37:22,770 --> 01:37:24,372
Let's see if God exists.

984
01:37:27,409 --> 01:37:30,845
[Loreno] I'll give God 60
seconds to strike me dead.

[ticking]

986
01:37:37,752 --> 01:37:38,486
Or...

987
01:37:41,756 --> 01:37:43,591
I'm going to put a
bullet in your heart.

988
01:37:43,625 --> 01:37:48,630
