只是说你让我们很失望。没有你更好。
Just says you let us down. Better off without you. 




121

00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,760
是啊，也许她是对的
Yeah, maybe she's right. 




122

00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,240

没有你我却没有感觉更好
I don't feel better off without you. 





123

00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,440
你有没有想过我的爸爸？
D'you ever think about me dad? 





124

00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,800
想了又有什么用呢？为什么问这个？
Not if I can help it. Why? 





125

00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,000

他也许已经变了
He might've changed. 





126

00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,320

是啊，每个彩虹的末端都有一罐金子
Yeah. And there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow. 





127

00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,440

你什么也不知道
You don't know nothing, you. 





128

00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,400
你真是个狗屁！你有没有想过你为什么自己一个人过？
You're full of shit. You ever wonder why you're on your own? 




129

00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960

Nolan！
NOLAN! 




130

00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,720

要么跳水，要么下来
Dive in, or get down. 


 


132

00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,440
来吧，Nolan！
Come on, Nolan! 




133

00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,880

他不会跳水！
Can't dive and he can't dive! 




134

00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,400

Skinner先生？你是不是Skinner先生？是啊，你不认识我
Mr Skinner? Are you Mr Skinner? Yeah, you don't know me. 




135

00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,520
我是他爸
I'm his dad. 


137

00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,560

Nolan！要么跳水，要么下来，小伙子！
NOLAN!Dive in or get down, lad! 





138

00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,880

- 嘿！是你做的么？ - 是！
- Hey! Did you do that? - Yeah!




139
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,680
- 你到底在玩什么花样？
- What the bleedin' hell are you playin' at? 




140
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,240

- 你说你会来见我!
- 我知道，可是出了点意外，我很抱歉
- You said you'd meet me! 
- I know, but something came up and I'm sorry. 





141
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
你也没必要这么做吧，是么？
No need for that, though, was there? 




142
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,640

要去给别人求求情把车修一下了
Going to cost a few bob to get that fixed. 





143
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640

哦，嘿！
Oh, eh! 




144
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,640

- Robbie，你要去哪？ - 妈妈说你是个失败者 - 靠
- Robbie, where you going? 
- Mum said you were a loser. - Cheers 






145
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,200

- 以前是，将来也是！ - 至少我不变化无常
- Always was, always will be! 
- At least I'm consistent. 





146

00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,720
好吧，我是个失败者，我会弥补你的
All right, I'm a loser. I'll make it up to you. 




147

00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,480

- 算了  - 来吧，给我们个机会
- Forget it. - Come on, give us a chance. 





148

00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,880

我说了算了。回你的爱尔兰
I said forget it. Go back to Ireland, I'm not arsed. 





149

00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,680
好吧，我是个讨厌鬼，可是你得先让我先做一件事
All right, I'll piss off, but let me do one thing first. 






151

00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,840
是Robbie
It's Robbie. 




152

00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,000

虽然我不会开
Thought I couldn't drive! 





153

00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,520
- 饿了？ - 快饿死了
- Hungry? 
- Starving. 




154
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,800

Viagra？你究竟想要Viagra干什么？（Viagra是一种治疗阳痿的药物）
Viagra? What the bloody hell d'you want Viagra for? 




155
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,920
你都81岁了，看在上帝的份上
You're 81 years of age, for Christ's sake! 




156
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,880
你会一路做撑杆跳去老年日托中心的
You'll be pole vaulting all the way to that daycare centre, 





157
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,120
如果你稍不留意，Sheila？
if you're not careful. Sheila? 





158
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,560
你是说女佣Sheila？爸爸！
Home Help Sheila? Dad! 





159
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,640
她唯一想要的东西就是你的退休金


The only thing she's trying to get her hands on is your pension! 





160

00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,120
她在么？如果她在，要她接电话！要她接电话！
Is she there? If she's there, put her on. Put her on! 





161

00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,760
听着，你！如果你不把你肮脏的手从他身上拿开，
Listen, you. If you don't keep your filthy mitts off him, 





162

00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,240

我就会马上到你这来
I'm going to come round there 




163

00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,680
然后把Sheen先生的罐头强行塞进你的屁股！
and shove that can of Mr Sheen so far up your arse, 





164

00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,560
这得花你两个星期把罐头拉出来。你听清楚了么？
it'll take you a fortnight to shit it out. Do you hear me? 





165

00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,360

- 盐和醋，喜欢么？ - 加点吧
- Salt and vinegar, love? 
- Please. 






166

00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,080

嘿！出去！你在干嘛，你这个无耻的坏蛋？！
Hey! Get out! What are you doing, you cheeky little twat?! 





167

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,360

你在我妈妈身上看出了什么？
What did you see in me mum? 





168

00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,400
没什么。我想着她的一个同事，Josie
I didn't. I fancied her mate, Josie. 





169

00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,200

她有着很大的乳房
She had bigger tits. 






170
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,840
她和一个水兵结了婚，所以我就收敛了我的想法
She had a gob to match, though, so I sacked that idea. 





171

00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,000
你估计她看出来你什么啦？
What you reckon she saw in you? 





172

00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,680

我会跳舞
I could dance. 




173

00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,680

有3件事是女人们喜欢的
There's three things women love. 





174

00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,280
一，男人会跳舞。二，男人会倾听
One, a man who can dance. Two, a man who'll listen. 




175

00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,840
要有即使你没想听你也要假装在倾听的技巧
The trick with that is to pretend you're listening when you're not. 




176

00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,680

三，总是对她们说的话表示赞同
And, three, always agree with everything they've said, 




177

00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,520

即使她们错了。就这些了
even when they're wrong. Simple. 




178
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,080
- 我不会跳舞  - 每个人都会  - 可是我不会
- I can't dance. - Everyone can dance. - I can't. 



179

00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,680

出去，来啊，出去
Get out. Go on, get out. 




180

00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,920
来啊，我来教你一些小动作。只需要从这边到这边
Go on, I'll teach you a few moves. Just go from side to side. 




181

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,560
哦，什么？！一二三四，一二三
Oh, what?! One, two, three, four. One, two，three. 




182

00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,040

背景音乐：Al Wilson的"The Snake"
MUSIC: "The Snake" by Al Wilson 





183

00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,160
不错！你马上就学会啦。学会感受舞蹈，对了。
That's good! You're getting there. Feeling it, yeah. 




184

00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,120

然后你就可以跟着感觉跳舞了
Then you've go to and get your fancy moves. 




185

00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
你要高踢腿。来吧，感受它
Do your high kicks. Come on, feel it. 





186

00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
应该来点音乐
In time to the music. 




187

00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,160
就是像这样
Something like that. 




188

00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,640
把基础学会了其他的技巧自然而然就都会了
Get the basics right and everything else will follow. 




189

00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,360
该怎么说呢，伙计...只要坚持两三遍就行了
Tell you what, mate... just stick to two and three. 





190
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,440

为什么你会跳舞而我不会呢？
How come you can dance and I can't? 





191
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,840

我不知道。就像我的爸爸，你的爷爷
Dunno. Take after me dad. Your grandad. 




192

00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,200
他是什么样子的？
What was he like? 




193

00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,640
- 你死了想要土葬还是火葬？ - 你吓着我了
- Do you want to be buried or cremated? 
- Surprise me. 




194

00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,280
- 你呢？ - 都不
- 'Bout you? - Neither. 


195

00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,800
他们觉得淹死是一个漫长的过程，是不是？
They reckon drowning's a good way to go, don't they? 





196

00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160

我不知道，我没试过
Dunno, never tried it. 





197

00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,600

- 你觉得他会听到我们么？ - 我很怀疑
- D'you reckon he can hear us? 
- Doubt it. 




198

00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,880

他是聋子！
He was deaf! 




199

00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,560
- 你爱他么？ - 他，我爸爸，是我们村子的大嘴巴
- Are you like him? - He was the talk of the village, me dad. 





200

00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,920

他喜欢讲故事。总是让我们坐在他的膝盖上
Always tellin' stories. Used to sit us on his knee 




201

00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,960
- 告诉我们关于在Killarney的往事。 - 你那时多大？
- and tell us all about the old days in Killarney. 
- How old were you? 





202

00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,760
29！不，没那么大，我不知道，也许4岁或5岁
29! Nah, dunno, four or five. 




203

00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,040
在学校放假的时候总是喜欢把我们带去那里
Used to take us there in the school holidays. 





204

00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,120

- 把我们带到Blarney岩石那。 - 那是哪里？ - 如果你亲吻了它,
- Took us to the Blarney Stone. - What's that? - If you kiss it, 





205
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,280

就意味着它给了你口才
it's meant to give you the gift of the gab. 





206
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,520

- 所以你就很容易捕获女孩们的心 - 有用么？ - 有
- So you'll have better luck chattin' up girls. 
- Did it work？ - Yeah. 




207
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,760

- 我在那搭讪了一个叫Mary的女孩 - 在Blarney岩石那里？- 是的
- Shagged this girl called Mary there. - On the Blarney Stone? - Yeah. 





208
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,400

我爸爸发疯了。但我知道他在想：这个不错，儿子
Me dad went mental. But I could tell he was thinking, "Nice one,son". 



209

00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,720
"你看上去很崇拜你的父亲?"
You're meant to look up to your dad. 





210

00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,760
确实是的，他是个英雄
I did. He was a hero. 




211

00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,280
你像他么？
Are you like him? 




212

00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360

来吧，天气渐冷了
Come on. It's getting cold. 





213

00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,880

- Leanne！ - 你想干嘛？ - 能给我抱一下么？ - 不能！
- Leanne! - What do you want? - Can I hold him? - No! 





214
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,800
- 就一下下，求你了  - 为什么你突然想抱他？
- Please, just for a bit? 
- Why are you suddenly arsed about him? 





215

00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,040

你甚至都不知道他的名字
You don't even know his name. 




216

00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,760
给他买点尿布
Buy him some nappies. 




217

00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760

这点钱一片都买不到！
That wouldn't even buy him one. 



218

00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,520
这是我所有的钱了，求你了
It's all I've got. Please? 





219
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,600
- 我让你抱是不是意味着你会放过我们？ - 是
- Will it mean you'll leave us alone? 
- Yeah. 





220

00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,240

像这样，要分力均匀，他可不是一袋土豆
Like that, divvy! He's not a sack of spuds. 




221

00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,760

嘿，伙计！
Hey, mate. 





222

00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,840

他叫Elliott
It's Elliott. 




223

00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,960

嗨，Elliott
Hi, Elliott. 




224

00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,240
他的名字是参考我爷爷取的
His first name's William after my granddad. 




225

00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,360

是Billy Elliott？
Billy Elliott? 


 


 


228

00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,360
远离我们，Robbie，好么？
Just stay away, Robbie, OK? 

 


230

00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:25,520

 - 那是谁？ - 只是我们学校的一个学生
- Who's that kid? - Just someone from school. 



233

00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,440
过来
Come on. 





234

00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,400

你长眼睛没！
Fucking move! 



235

00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,320
- 你怎么这么软弱？追上他 - 为什么？
- What are you doin' soft lad? Go after him. - Why? 




236

00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,800

- 你就这么放过他了？ - 我没事
- You're going to let him get away with that? 
- I'm all right. 




237

00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,200
你得照顾好你自己，Rob。没有其他人会关心你
You got to look after yourself, Rob. No-one else will. 





238

00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
你理解我说的话么？--没人！
Do you understand me? No-one. 




239

00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,880

你喜欢怎么出拳？
What are you like with your fists? 





240

00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,920

让我看看。不是这样，打我，来，打我
Show me. No, no, no. Hit me. Come on. Hit me. 




241

He said if I ever told anyone, that my dad would die as well, so be good. 





398
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,680
正是因为我不乖所以我妈妈就死了
It was cos I hadn't been good that my mum died.

我爸爸抓住他在。。。

I've never seen him again and my dad won't have his name mentioned. 





402

我怀孕了

403

00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,480

我并不想的
I didn't want it.



404

00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,680

你需要找人倾诉
You need to talk to someone. 






405

00:51:23,360 --> 00:51:24,560

确实
I am. 





407

00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,880

见鬼！你爸爸！我等一下再见你
Shit. Your dad! I'll see you later. 






411

00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:07,920

好像是婴儿的叫唤
Sounds like a baby. 





412

00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:24,880

有可能是一只猫

415

00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:02,320
猫让你哑口无言？
The cat that got your tongue. 







417

00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,520
嘘，别这样
Ssh. Come on. 






420
00:55:01,120 --> 00:55:05,120
小伙子还有个六个月大的婴儿
Young lad. The baby's only six months old. 





421

00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,480
我想我夜里听到了婴儿叫声，可那是一只猫
Thought I heard a baby in the night. But it was a cat. 




422

00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,160
提防点，他枪击了某人
Keep an eye out for him. He shot someone. 





423

00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:55,800
我猜在你耳朵后面
I bet you haven't done behind your ears. 





424

00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:57,640
我从爸爸的罐子里找到这个的
I got this from Dad's tin. 





425

00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,680
没事的，我会照看Elliot的

我不希望那是唯一的一次

我没有，他就在这里的。他就在面包篮里面
I'm not. He was here. He was in the bread basket. 





462

00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,000
可恨！你为什么这么做？他又不是面包。
Fucking hell, why did you do that? He's not a loaf. 





463

嘘，你很好！

不是你的错

01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:40,920
只是... 我觉得你还没有准备好

只是...

496

01:01:38,280 --> 01:01:40,160
这是我闯的货祸，不是你的

01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,160
- 给他我从来没有的 - 你觉得你有多大可能让我和你一起去？
- Give him what I never had. 
- What's the odds of you letting me come too? 





539

01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,800

- 可是你从来没去过Killarney - 不，我去过！
- Bet you've never even been to Killarney. 
- Yes, I have! 





540

01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,120

就信我一次，这一点是真的
Once. That bit was true. 





541

01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,240
那时我只有5岁
When I was about five. 





542

01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,080
是，我从来没想过归家
Yeah, I never wanted to come home. 





543

01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,560

唯一一次我看见我爸爸和我妈妈快乐的在一起
The only time I ever saw me mum and dad happy together. 





544

01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,760
于是...我们回家了，回到了原状
And then...we came home. Back to normal. 





545

01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,280

什么意思？
What was? 





546

01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,840
我爸爸每天夜里酩酊大醉地回到家里对我妈妈拳打脚踢
Me dad coming home bladdered every night and battering me mum. 





547

01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,600
我问你你是不是像他
I asked you if you were like him. 





548

01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,880

你从没回答过，你就是！
You never answered. You are. 





549

01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,280
他喝酒，你赌博，一样的事情，你们都伤害你们的亲人
He drank. You gambled. Same thing. You both hurt people. 




550

01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,720

- Rob... - 那个墓地的女人是谁？
- Rob... - And who was that woman in t'graveyard? 





551

01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,120
- 我妈妈，你奶奶 - 我还以为她死了，你为什么撒谎？
- Me mum. Your nan. - I thought she was dead. Why'd you lie? 





552

01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,840

- 你看，Rob，我们在这都快湿透了 - 为什么？
- Look, Rob, we're getting soaked here, mate. - Why? 




553
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,600
- 来吧，伙计，太冷了，我们都湿透了  - 为什么？
- Come on, mate, it's cold, we'll get soaked. - Why? 





554

01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,360
- 婴儿要着凉了！ - 为什么？！ - 为什么？为什么？都去死吧！
- The baby'll get a cold! - Why?! 
- Why?! Why, why, why! Fucking hell! 





555

01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,840
因为我觉得我是个混蛋，好吗？高兴了？
Cos I feel shit, OK? Happy now? 





556

01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,880
我憎恨自己有这种恶习！
I feel shit about me, about this fucking habit. 





557

01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,480
我16岁的时候就离开了我母亲
I left me mum when I was 16. 





558

01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,440
我把她留给了我的老爷子，真是白痴啊！
I left her to me old fella, that was a shithead 





559

01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,680
是谁把她打得满地找牙？不是我！好么！
who beat the shit out of her and I did nothing! OK? 





560

01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,160
我从没回去过，直到...
I didn't go back until... 





561

01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,840

我们在镇上的时候，那时你还是个婴儿
we were in town and you were a little baby. 





562

01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,480
我们的Bernie说我爸爸在昏迷中，得了癌症
Our Bernie said me dad's in the dizzy, got cancer 





563

01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,240
想要你再见他一面，说个再见的话，仅此而已
and wants you to see him, say goodbye and all that. 




564

01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,680

所以我就去了病房
So I goes to the ward 




565

01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,000
在那他浑身都插满了管子
and there he is with all the tubes 




566

01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,800
我妈妈就坐在那，紧紧抓住他的手
and me mum sitting there holding his hand and that. 





567

01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,840
天杀的！
Fucking hell! 




568

01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,240

她做了她自己，你知道我说的意思么？所有对他的爱表露无遗
She done herself up, you know what I mean? All lovely for him. 





569

01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,560
然后呢？
Then what? 





570

01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,560
没什么，我什么都没做
Nothing. I did nothing. 





571

01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,760
就像我一直什么都不做一样
Like I've always done nothing. 





572

01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,440

我直接走了
I just walked. 





573

01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,960
Robbie！你要做什么，孩子？
Robbie! What are you doing, mate? 





574

01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,680
你要带着孩子去做什么，Rob？Robbie！
What are you doing, Rob, with the baby? Robbie! 





575

01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,880
他是我儿子，他们不可以带走他。我是他爸
He's my son. They're not having him. I'm his dad. 





576

01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,520
别傻了，你要干什么？跳下去？你不会跳的！
Don't be silly. What'll you do? Jump? You can't jump! 





577

01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,360

武警！远离悬崖！
Armed police! Step away from the edge! 





578

01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,680
为什么这样？又在想你自己？每个人都会谴责你的，对么？
Why? Thinking about yourself again? Everyone's going to blame you, eh? 






579

01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,960
如果有人该跳下去，那就是我
If anyone's to jump, it should be me. 





580

01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,160

好吧，来啊，你跳啊
Go on, then. Do it.  





582

01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,640
你不会跳的！
You won't jump! 




583

01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,760
天杀的！我甚至连自杀都是个失败者！天杀的
Fucking hell, I'm a failure at that, even! Fucking hell! 




584

01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,200
从悬崖边走过来！
Move away from the edge! 




585

01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,600

你会让我...
Will you let me... 






586

01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,800

给我另一个机会，我会证明给你看我可以做好的
Give me another chance, and I'll prove I can be all right, 






587

01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,320

我可以做好你的父亲
I can be your dad. 





588

01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,160
Rob，给我们一个机会，告诉我我不是坏爸爸，求你了
Rob, give us a chance and tell me I'm not bad, please. 





589

01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,920

求你了，儿子！
Please. Please, mate. 





590

01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,800
回见，Elliot

591

01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,640
回到你妈妈身边去
Go back to your mum now. 





592

01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,960

她会照顾你的

593

01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,360
起来
Get up. 





594

01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,920

起来！
Get up! 





595

01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,160

把他还给她
Give him back to her. 




596

01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,960
他的尿布需要换了

597

01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,400

做点什么吧

598

01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,840
回见，Elliot

他们知道你什么时候会淹死
They reckon that when you're drowning, 





601

01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:03,800
你看见你的一生在你眼前闪过。但我不是
you see your life flash before you. But I didn't. 





602

01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,720
我却看到了另一个人的一生
I saw someone else's life





603

01:13:07,720 --> 01:13:10,800
他是我的儿子， Elliot
