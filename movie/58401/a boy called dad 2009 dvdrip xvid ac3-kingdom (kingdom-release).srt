00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:09,040
This film contains strong language 

2
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,920
They reckon that, when you're drowning, 

3
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,440
you see your life flash before you. 

4
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,040
I didn't. 

5
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
HEAVY BREATHING THROUGHOUT 

6
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,920
- Not like that, dickhead! 
- Sorry. 

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,600
- I've not got anything. 
- S'OK, it's a safe day. 
- Monday? 

8
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,120
No, knobhead, me cycle! 

9
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,800
HEAVY BREATHING CONTINUES 

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,760
Can't you go on top? 

11
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,200
I've just had a double cheeseburger. I'd hurl. Just get on with it! 

12
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,440
Hurry up, or I'll miss me bus! 

13
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,960
Shit. I broke me nail! 

14
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,400
SPLASHING 

15
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,240
CHEERING 

16
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,760
Look, just calm down, will you, Jackie? 

17
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,680
Look, I can't get a word in edgeways here! 

18
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,920
This isn't what I had in mind, that's all. 

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,960
Oh, look, I feel stupid. 

20
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,800
Not only do I feel stupid, I look stupid! 

21
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,600
All the kids are just taking the piss. 

22
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,600
It's all right for you, I'd like to see you walking around like this. 

23
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:53,320
Oi! Come here, you, you little shit! 

24
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,920
Get here, you little shit! I'll have you when I get hold of you! 

25
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,000
What the bleedin' hell are you playing at, soft lad? 

26
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,520
I could've killed you then! 

27
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,160
Dad? 

28
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,440
- What? 
- It's me. 
- Who? 

29
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,840
- Robbie. 
- My Robbie? What are you doing, lad? 

30
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,160
- He's after me, please! 
- Oi! 
- What's the score with him, then? 

31
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:24,000
- You little sod! 
- Oh, hang about. 
- I want a word with you! 

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,440
Oi! Get here! 

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:30,080
I'll have you, you little sod! You haven't seen the last of me! 

34
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,000
Think he's topped himself! 

35
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,040
HE LAUGHS 

36
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:41,360
So what's the score with Mr Whippy, then? 

37
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,720
- Me and me mates were messin'. Borrowed his van. 
- Borrowed? 

38
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,120
We were gonna give it back. Stalled it. The others legged it. 

39
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,480
Shocking. Rule number one. If you're gonna be the getaway driver, 

40
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,080
don't stall the car. 

41
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,080
- Thought you lived in Ireland. 
- Yeah, I do. 

42
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,480
I'm just over here doin' a job for a mate, you know. 

43
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,000
Been over here before? 

44
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,000
Why do you sound like a Manc? 

45
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,320
- Lived in Manchester with our Katie's dad. 
- You've got a sister? 

46
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,520
- Pain in the arse. 
- How come you're here, then? 

47
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,400
Mum and Terry split up. 

48
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,960
How old are you now, mate? 

49
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,240
14. 

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,080
How come you never came to see us? 

51
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Yeah, I would've if I could, but, you know, it's complex, 

52
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,880
you know what I mean, with Ireland and that. 

53
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,800
- How long you here for now? 
- Not long. 

54
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,280
Look, I've just got to see a man about a horse. 

55
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,960
You stay here, though, right? 

56
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,800
I won't be long. 

57
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,760
RACING COMMENTARY 

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,400
Come on, come on, come on. 

59
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,880
Get in! Thought he was gonna bottle it, then. 

60
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,920
The patron saint of jockeys 

61
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,840
must have been looking after you today, you jammy get. 

62
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,760
Hee-hee! Cheers, Billiam. 

63
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:48,600
- Happy days, lad! 
- D'you always win? 

64
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,040
Oh, aye, yeah. Apart from when I lose. 

65
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,320
Mum reckons it's a mug's game. 

66
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,000
Yeah? Then you won't want this off this mug. 

67
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,760
Here you go. 

68
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,680
Go on. 

69
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,800
- You won it. 
- It's yours. What's mine's yours. 

70
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,880
- Will I see you again? 
- Course. 

71
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,400
You on the front tomorrow? Same time? 

72
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,880
Yeah. 

73
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,880
Maybe not a good idea to let on to your mum that you've seen me here. 

74
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,320
I won't. 

75
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,160
All right. 

76
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,320
Cheer up! 

77
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,240
Mine went further. 

78
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,960
- Like that? 
- And the chips go in. That's marvellous. Step two. 

79
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,840
And then the, you know... Thanks very much. 

80
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,600
The piece de resistance... 

81
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,040
is the curry sauce, which I can't open. One sec. 

82
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,240
Oh, it's all over the show now! Here you go, have a bit of that. 

83
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,520
There we go. 

84
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,360
Jamie Oliver, my arse, mate. 

85
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,440
BABY CRIES 

86
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,920
- Do you know her? 
- No. 

87
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,120
- Which way's Ireland? 
- Perch Rock and take a left. 

88
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,120
On a clear day, you can see Val Doonican. 

89
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,080
Who? 

90
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,040
You know, Val Doonican. 

91
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,520
# Walk tall, walk tall and look the world right in the eye. # 

92
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,400
You laughin' at me? 

93
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,840
Ah, he's made a happy man very old. 

94
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,280
- Are there any nice girls in Killarney? 
- Oh, yeah. 

95
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:06,320
Want me to put a word in for you? 

96
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,880
Don't worry, I'll make sure that, y'know, she's got all the bits. 

97
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,560
You with anyone? 

98
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,200
No. 

99
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,480
Maybe you could come back to live with us. 

100
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,720
The chances of that are poor to piss poor, son. 

101
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,840
Your mum'd never have me back. 

102
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,920
She might change her mind. Women do - it's a well-known fact. 

103
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,760
- Yeah? Not your mum. 
- SHIP HORN BLARES 

104
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,600
I'm always lookin' out for you on that. 

105
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,680
- Sometimes I reckon I've seen you on it. 
- Yeah? 

106
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,720
- D'you remember a snow globe you got me? 
- Snow globe? 

107
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
It had a nativity in it. Cracked. 

108
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,320
Yeah! Yeah, I do remember it now, yeah. 

109
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,080
Mary's head fell off, we stuck it back on with Bostick. 

110
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,160
- You can see the join. 
- The thought that counts. 

111
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,200
- You kept that all this time? 
- The snow doesn't snow. Never did. 

112
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,600
Snow's overrated anyway. 

113
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,520
Kept this an' all. 

114
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,800
I remember that day. Bits of it. 

115
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,200
I was havin' a banana milkshake. 

116
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,760
We were in that cafe at Hollyhead. Before we got the train home. 

117
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:57,240
Why did you leave us? 

118
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,280
Your mum never told you? 

119
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,920
She doesn't talk about it. 

120
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,480
Just says you let us down. Better off without you. 

121
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,760
Yeah, maybe she's right. 

122
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,240
I don't feel better off without you. 

123
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,440
D'you ever think about me dad? 

124
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,800
Not if I can help it. Why? 

125
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,000
He might've changed. 

126
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,320
Yeah. And there's a pot of gold at the end of every rainbow. 

127
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,440
You don't know nothing, you. 

128
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,400
You're full of shit. You ever wonder why you're on your own? 

129
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,960
NOLAN! 

130
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,720
Dive in, or get down. 

131
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,840
JEERING 

132
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,440
Come on, Nolan! 

133
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,880
< Can't drive and he can't dive! 

134
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,400
Mr Skinner? Are you Mr Skinner? Yeah, you don't know me. 

135
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm his dad. 

136
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:32,880
LAUGHTER 

137
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,560
NOLAN! Dive in or get down, lad! 

138
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,680
- Hey! Did you do that? 
- Yeah! 
- What the bleedin' hell are you playin' at? 

139
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:20,240
- You said you'd meet me! 
- I know, but something came up and I'm sorry. 

140
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,400
No need for that, though, was there? 

141
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,640
Going to cost a few bob to get that fixed. 

142
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,640
Oh, eh! 

143
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:32,640
- Robbie, where you going? 
- Mum said you were a loser. 
- Cheers(!) 

144
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,200
- Always was, always will be! 
- At least I'm consistent. 

145
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:39,520
ENGINE REVS 

146
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,720
All right, I'm a loser. I'll make it up to you. 

147
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,480
- Forget it. 
- Come on, give us a chance. 

148
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,880
I said forget it. Go back to Ireland, I'm not arsed. 

149
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,680
All right, I'll piss off, but let me do one thing first. 

150
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,880
HE HONKS HORN 

151
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,840
It's Robbie. 

152
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,000
Thought I couldn't drive! 

153
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,520
- Hungry? 
- Starving. 

154
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,800
Viagra? What the bloody hell d'you want Viagra for? 

155
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,920
You're 81 years of age, for Christ's sake! 

156
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,880
You'll be pole vaulting all the way to that daycare centre, 

157
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,120
if you're not careful. Sheila? 

158
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,560
Home Help Sheila? Dad! 

159
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,640
The only thing she's trying to get her hands on is your pension! 

160
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,120
Is she there? If she's there, put her on. Put her on! 

161
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,760
Listen, you. If you don't keep your filthy mitts off him, 

162
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm going to come round there 

163
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,680
and shove that can of Mr Sheen so far up your arse, 

164
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,560
it'll take you a fortnight to shit it out. Do you hear me? 

165
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,360
- Salt and vinegar, love? 
- Please. 

166
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,080
Hey! Get out! What are you doing, you cheeky little twat?! 

167
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,360
What did you see in me mum? 

168
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,400
I didn't. I fancied her mate, Josie. 

169
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,200
She had bigger tits. 

170
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,840
She had a gob to match, though, so I sacked that idea. 

171
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,000
What you reckon she saw in you? 

172
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,680
I could dance. 

173
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,680
There's three things women love. 

174
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,280
One, a man who can dance. Two, a man who'll listen. 

175
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,840
The trick with that is to pretend you're listening when you're not. 

176
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,680
And, three, always agree with everything they've said, 

177
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,520
even when they're wrong. Simple. 

178
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:04,080
- I can't dance. 
- Everyone can dance. 
- I can't. 

179
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,680
Get out. Go on, get out. 

180
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:16,920
Go on, I'll teach you a few moves. Just go from side to side. 

181
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,560
Oh, what?! One, two, three, four. One, two three. 

182
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,040
MUSIC: "The Snake" by Al Wilson 

183
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,160
That's good! You're getting there. Feeling it, yeah. 

184
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,120
Then you've go to and get your fancy moves. 

185
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,600
Do your high kicks. Come on, feel it. 

186
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,600
In time to the music. 

187
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,160
Something like that. 

188
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,640
Get the basics right and everything else will follow. 

189
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:06,360
Tell you what, mate... just stick to two and three. 

190
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:17,440
How come you can dance and I can't? 

191
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,840
Dunno. Take after me dad. Your grandad. 

192
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,200
What was he like? 

193
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,640
- Do you want to be buried or cremated? 
- Surprise me. 

194
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:31,280
- 'Bout you? 
- Neither. 

195
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,800
They reckon drowning's a good way to go, don't they? 

196
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,160
Dunno, never tried it. 

197
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:40,600
- D'you reckon he can hear us? 
- Doubt it. 

198
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:44,880
- He was deaf! 
- HE LAUGHS 

199
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,560
- Are you like him? 
- He was the talk of the village, me dad. 

200
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,920
Always tellin' stories. Used to sit us on his knee 

201
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,960
- and tell us all about the old days in Killarney. 
- How old were you? 

202
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,760
29! Nah, dunno, four or five. 

203
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:01,040
Used to take us there in the school holidays. 

204
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,120
- Took us to the Blarney Stone. 
- What's that? 
- If you kiss it, 

205
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,280
it's meant to give you the gift of the gab. 

206
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,520
- So you'll have better luck chattin' up girls. 
- Did it work? 
- Yeah. 

207
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,760
- Shagged this girl called Mary there. 
- On the Blarney Stone? 
- Yeah. 

208
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,400
Me dad went mental. But I could tell he was thinking, "Nice one, son". 

209
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,720
You're meant to look up to your dad. 

210
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,760
I did. He was a hero. 

211
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,280
Are you like him? 

212
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
Come on. It's getting cold. 

213
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,880
- Leanne! 
- What do you want? 
- Can I hold him? 
- No! 

214
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:23,800
- Please, just for a bit? 
- Why are you suddenly arsed about him? 

215
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,040
You don't even know his name. 

216
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,760
Buy him some nappies. 

217
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
That wouldn't even buy him one. 

218
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,520
It's all I've got. Please? 

219
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,600
- Will it mean you'll leave us alone? 
- Yeah. 

220
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,240
Like that, divvy! He's not a sack of spuds. 

221
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,760
Hey, mate. 

222
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,840
It's Elliott. 

223
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,960
Hi, Elliott. 

224
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,240
His first name's William after my granddad. 

225
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,360

- Why? 

236
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,800
- You're going to let him get away with that? 
- I'm all right. 

237
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:13,200
You got to look after yourself, Rob. No-one else will. 

238
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,600
Do you understand me? No-one.

You all right, mate? 

247
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,720
I'm sorry. 

248
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,320

All right, eh? 

251
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,800
- Has my dad been in? 
- Who? 
- Joe. 

252
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:16,120
- No, lad. He's back home, over the water. 
- He's back in Ireland already? 

253
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,160
Ireland?! Liverpool. 

254
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:23,560
- His home's in Ireland. 
- I think you've got your wires crossed, lad. 

255
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,880
He lives in Liverpool. 

256
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,640
- How long's he lived there for? 
- Years. 

257

Yeah. It's just we've been apart for a bit.

Treats me like a kid. 

383
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:40,320
Can't go anywhere on my own, except the farm. 

384
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:44,800
Maybe he just wants to look after you?

- He's not. 
- How do you know? Could be some old perv.

He said... 

397
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:44,800
He said if I ever told anyone, that my dad would die as well, so be good. 

398
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:50,680
It was cos I hadn't been good that my mum died.

On my 12th birthday, 

400

my dad caught him. 

401
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:07,440
I've never seen him again and my dad won't have his name mentioned. 

402
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:08,800
I got pregnant. 

403
00:51:11,120 --> 00:51:12,480

Young lad. The baby's only six months old.

00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,480
Thought I heard a baby in the night. But it was a cat. 

422
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:11,160
Keep an eye out for him. He shot someone.

- Not yet.

Do this, Robbie, and you'll have him back

- I'm the only one who can help you. 
- Then tell me where Elliot is.

Please. 

452
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,840

- I left him here. 
- Nia, don't piss about! 

461
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,520
I'm not. He was here. He was in the bread basket. 

462
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,000
Fucking hell, why did you do that? He's not a loaf. 

463
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,840
He needs feeding. He'll be hungry. 

464
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,520
He'd be crying, why ain't he crying? Why ain't he? 

465
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,120

01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,320
Just promise me first. 

487
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:06,960
- I don't know what it is, though. 
- You trust me? 

488
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:09,760
Then promise.

Can't I just go with you instead? 

492
01:01:27,120 --> 01:01:30,880
Could lie and say yeah, come to Ireland. 

493
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,880
But I'd dump you in Holyhead. 

494
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,240
Not cos I don't like you. 

495
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:38,280

520
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:53,880
Shit. 

521

ELLIOT CRIES 

522
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,600
- Hey, come on, what's up? 
- ELLIOT COUGHS 

523
01:07:31,600 --> 01:07:35,360
We'll get a boat from somewhere. We'll get our own boat, eh? 

524
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,680
Ssh. Come on. 

525
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:50,640
- You're in all the papers, you know. 
- Fuck off. You said you'd meet me. 

526
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:54,000
I know, but how was I to know you'd steal a baby and go on the run? 

527
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,120
He's not "a baby." He's my son. 

528
01:07:56,120 --> 01:07:58,760
Even so, you still abducted him. 

529
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,720
You're still wanted by the bizzies. 

530
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:04,120
How did you know I'd be here? 

531
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,120
Here you are. 

532
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,640
Photo. 

533
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:09,880
Rob! 

534

POLICE SIREN 

535
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:16,960
Robbie! 

536
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,240
Rob! What are you going to do, mate? 

537
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:24,240
What you never did - go to Ireland, me and Elliot. 

538
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:28,160
- Give him what I never had. 
- What's the odds of you letting me come too? 

539
01:08:28,160 --> 01:08:30,800
- Bet you've never even been to Killarney. 
- Yes, I have! 

540
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,120
Once. That bit was true. 

541
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,240
When I was about five. 

542
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:37,080
Yeah, I never wanted to come home. 

543
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:41,560
The only time I ever saw me mum and dad happy together. 

544
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:44,760
And then...we came home. Back to normal. 

545
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,280
What was? 

546
01:08:47,280 --> 01:08:50,840
Me dad coming home bladdered every night and battering me mum. 

547
01:08:50,840 --> 01:08:52,600
I asked you if you were like him. 

548
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:56,880
You never answered. You are. 

549
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:00,280
He drank. You gambled. Same thing. You both hurt people. 

550
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:05,720
- Rob... 
- And who was that woman in t'graveyard? 

551
01:09:05,720 --> 01:09:09,120
- Me mum. Your nan. 
- I thought she was dead. Why'd you lie? 

552
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:11,840
- Look, Rob, we're getting soaked here, mate. 
- Why? 

553
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,600
- Come on, mate, it's cold, we'll get soaked. 
- Why? 

554
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:19,360
- The baby'll get a cold! 
- Why?! 
- Why?! Why, why, why! Fucking hell! 

555
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,840
Cos I feel shit, OK? Happy now? 

556
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,880
I feel shit about me, about this fucking habit. 

557
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,480
I left me mum when I was 16. 

558
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:32,440
I left her to me old fella, that was a shithead 

559
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:35,680
who beat the shit out of her and I did nothing! OK? 

560
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:42,160
I didn't go back until... 

561
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,840
..we were in town and you were a little baby. 

562
01:09:46,840 --> 01:09:49,480
Our Bernie said me dad's in the hozzy, got cancer 

563
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,240
and wants you to see him, say goodbye and all that. 

564
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,680
So I goes to the ward 

565
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,000
and there he is with all the tubes 

566
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,800
and me mum sitting there holding his hand and that. 

567
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:02,840
Fucking hell! 

568
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:07,240
She done herself up, you know what I mean? All lovely for him. 

569
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:09,560
Then what? 

570
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:11,560
Nothing. I did nothing. 

571
01:10:11,560 --> 01:10:13,760
Like I've always done nothing. 

572
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,440
- POLICE SIREN 
- I just walked. 

573
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:22,960
Robbie! What are you doing, mate? 

574
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,680
What are you doing, Rob, with the baby? Robbie! 

575
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:29,880
He's my son. They're not having him. I'm his dad. 

576
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,520
Don't be silly. What'll you do? Jump? You can't jump! 

577
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:38,360
Armed police! Step away from the edge! 

578
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,680
Why? Thinking about yourself again? Everyone's going to blame you, eh? 

579
01:10:43,720 --> 01:10:45,960
If anyone's to jump, it should be me. 

580
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,160
Go on, then. Do it.

ELLIOT CRIES 

582
01:10:56,360 --> 01:10:58,640
You won't jump! 

583
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,760
Fucking hell, I'm a failure at that, even! Fucking hell! 

584
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:27,200
Move away from the edge! 

585
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,600
Will you let me... 

586
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,800
Give me another chance, and I'll prove I can be all right, 

587
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:42,320
I can be your dad. 

588
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,160
Rob, give us a chance and tell me I'm not bad, please. 

589
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,920
Please. Please, mate. 

590
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,800
See you, Elliot. 

591
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,640
Go back to your mum now. 

592
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:04,960
She'll look after you. 

593
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:10,360
Get up. 

594
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,920
Get up! 

595
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:23,160
Give him back to her. 

596
01:12:23,160 --> 01:12:24,960
His nappy needs changing. 

597
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,400
Do summat. 

598
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:35,840
