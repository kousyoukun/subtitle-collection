00:00:02,786 --> 00:00:05,234
Hello, my name is Ekwa Msangi.

2
00:00:05,345 --> 00:00:10,517
I am the writer and director of the film
that you're about to watch, Farewell Amor,

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,855
which is my feature film
directorial debut.

4
00:00:14,896 --> 00:00:18,125
We premiered at Sundance 2020
in competition

5
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:22,213
and I'm so excited
to have you watch it here on MUBI.

6
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:26,015
Please join me afterwards
for a conversation that I will have

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:29,087
with my dear friend
and colleague John Akomfrah,

8
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:32,082
as we talk about the film.
I look forward to seeing you then.

9
00:01:11,056 --> 00:01:12,723
Welcome to Terminal Four

10
00:01:12,765 --> 00:01:15,643
at John F Kennedy International Airport.

11
00:01:15,685 --> 00:01:18,646
You should not accept offers
of transportation

12
00:01:18,688 --> 00:01:21,232
from anyone
without prior arrangement.

13
00:01:21,274 --> 00:01:24,735
An unknown driver may not
be licensed, have insurance

14
00:01:24,777 --> 00:01:28,239
and may overcharge you now
or at the end of your ride.

15
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,814
Amor!

16
00:02:18,789 --> 00:02:20,666
Amor.

17
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,044
Here you are.

18
00:02:23,086 --> 00:02:25,713
Oh, Sylvia.

19
00:02:25,755 --> 00:02:29,384
Look at this. Look at this!

20
00:02:29,425 --> 00:02:30,885
- Big girl.
- Uh-huh.

21
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:32,095
Huh? Yes.

22
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,888
Turn around. Let me see.

23
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:36,307
Let me see. Let me see.

24
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:38,184
Wow!

25
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,584
You are here!

26
00:02:43,148 --> 00:02:45,233
Here.

27
00:02:52,782 --> 00:02:55,618
Wow. Sylvia, look.

28
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:57,995
So, what do you think
of New York?

29
00:02:58,037 --> 00:02:59,372
It's amazing!

30
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:01,666
We'll have to practice
speaking English more.

31
00:03:20,393 --> 00:03:21,936
Are you okay?

32
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:25,356
Sylvia, aren't you excited?

33
00:03:28,093 --> 00:03:29,944
This is home. Welcome!

34
00:03:29,985 --> 00:03:31,654
I need to use the bathroom.

35
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:34,699
Oh, yes.
Let me show you. Esther,

36
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,034
you and I will be sleeping down there.

37
00:03:37,076 --> 00:03:38,786
Kitchen is over there,

38
00:03:38,828 --> 00:03:43,208
and, Sylvia, I've converted
the living room for now

39
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:45,293
so you can have your own space.

40
00:03:46,377 --> 00:03:49,297
I'm looking for a bigger place
that will be more suitable.

41
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:54,302
Maybe you'll be like
all the American kids

42
00:03:54,344 --> 00:03:57,847
- and get your own place!
- Eh-ehn. Not yet.

43
00:03:57,888 --> 00:04:02,017
First, we live as a family,
as God intended it.

44
00:04:02,059 --> 00:04:04,770
Yes, of course. Of course.

45
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:07,690
Oh, Sylvia,
the bathroom is down there.

46
00:04:07,732 --> 00:04:09,734
The light is on the wall to your left.

47
00:04:20,745 --> 00:04:22,830
Bon appétit.

48
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:30,004
I wish your mother could see this.

49
00:04:30,045 --> 00:04:32,548
Her boy learned how to cook!

50
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:34,425
I hope you like it.

51
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:38,721
- Who taught you?
- Ah, you know, I...

52
00:04:38,763 --> 00:04:41,766
I picked up some things
here and there.

53
00:04:42,808 --> 00:04:44,519
Please, eat, before it gets cold.

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,604
Let's pray first.

55
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:48,898
We have a lot to be thankful for.

56
00:04:48,939 --> 00:04:51,025
Yes. Sorry.

57
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,864
Jehova Jaira,

58
00:04:56,906 --> 00:04:59,784
we praise your name in the most high.

59
00:04:59,825 --> 00:05:03,746
Lord, thank you
for bringing us together

60
00:05:03,788 --> 00:05:05,915
after 17 years apart.

61
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:10,461
We thank you for your
endless blessings and love.

62
00:05:10,503 --> 00:05:13,964
We thank you for our home
and our family.

63
00:05:14,006 --> 00:05:17,343
We thank you because the devil is shamed

64
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:19,345
and defeated!

65
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:24,517
We pray all these things
in the holy name of Jesus!

66
00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:26,352
- Amen.
- Amen.

67
00:05:26,394 --> 00:05:27,395
Amen.

68
00:05:27,437 --> 00:05:29,939
- Amen.
- Amen.

69
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:36,371
Yes.

70
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,169
It's very soft.

71
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,255
Mm. Tender, yeah?

72
00:05:57,174 --> 00:06:00,052
Americans don't like stew
with their food?

73
00:06:00,094 --> 00:06:03,055
The doctor recommended
low-fat meals.

74
00:06:03,097 --> 00:06:04,265
Hmm.

75
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:08,018
You know, for years

76
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,730
the only food I could eat

77
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:12,147
was my mother's cooking.

78
00:06:12,189 --> 00:06:16,986
So, when we got married,
I forced your poor mama

79
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:20,365
to learn how to cook
all of my mama's dishes.

80
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:27,955
Your poor mama.

81
00:06:29,582 --> 00:06:31,834
She should have never
have put up with me.

82
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:08,621
My pastor said we must focus

83
00:07:08,663 --> 00:07:11,916
on familiarizing ourselves
in spirit and flesh,

84
00:07:11,957 --> 00:07:14,585
in order to rebuild our family.

85
00:07:16,629 --> 00:07:19,256
I...

86
00:07:19,298 --> 00:07:22,009
- No, wait.
- I'm old now, unattractive.

87
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:24,512
No, you're not.

88
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:26,889
Lying is a sin, you know.

89
00:07:26,931 --> 00:07:30,643
That's...
that's not what I meant.

90
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:40,445
I haven't been with any man
since you left.

91
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:45,115
Thank you.

92
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:48,828
I mean, I'm sorry
I wasn't there.

93
00:08:28,868 --> 00:08:31,829
Is this everything?

94
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:33,873
Linda!

95
00:08:36,876 --> 00:08:38,794
I hope everything works out.

96
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,235
It's just been a long day.

97
00:09:03,277 --> 00:09:07,740
Perhaps we should just
get some... rest... first.

98
00:09:30,429 --> 00:09:32,598
Ready for American school?

99
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,518
Of course she is.
She's going to study hard

100
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,604
so she can get into medical school...

101
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:40,773
with a scholarship. Mm-hm.

102
00:09:40,815 --> 00:09:43,358
The first doctor in the family,
God willingly.

103
00:09:47,154 --> 00:09:50,324
What kind of medicine
are you interested in?

104
00:09:50,365 --> 00:09:52,326
She wants to treat children.

105
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:54,036
I like mathematics.

106
00:09:54,078 --> 00:09:57,498
Brilliant like her father, this one.
I keep telling you,

107
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,874
your father was always studying

108
00:09:58,916 --> 00:10:01,043
so many things
when we met in university.

109
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:15,683
I need to see your backpack.

110
00:10:15,725 --> 00:10:17,476
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, she's new.

111
00:10:17,518 --> 00:10:19,520
Please step back, sir.
I just need to check her bags.

112
00:10:19,562 --> 00:10:21,647
I have this referral form.

113
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,945
Watch out.

114
00:10:36,453 --> 00:10:38,539
Commandante,

115
00:10:38,581 --> 00:10:40,165
you find any change in the seat?

116
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,168
I see you changed
the other picture.

117
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:46,130
- Yeah.
- They settled in?

118
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:48,423
Somewhat.

119
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,493
I know the sex must be good.

120
00:10:51,677 --> 00:10:53,596
Whenever I go back home,

121
00:10:53,638 --> 00:10:55,890
my wife is like
she have something to prove.

122
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:59,644
I can only imagine after,
what is it, nine years?

123
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,020
- 17.
- Oh!

124
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,606
She's supposed to be lucky
that you was with the nurse,

125
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:06,316
or else you'd be in jail
for homicide.

126
00:11:08,068 --> 00:11:10,195
What?

127
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:11,781
You know it's the truth, man.

128
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:13,741
I don't want to talk about it.

129
00:11:13,783 --> 00:11:17,536
My brother,
all I'm saying to you,

130
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:20,289
you're not the only person
who ever been in this situation.

131
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,791
Okay? Things happen.

132
00:11:21,832 --> 00:11:23,208
Don't feel bad.

133
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,795
I don't. Everything's fine.

134
00:11:25,836 --> 00:11:27,379
Okay.

135
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:30,966
Well, I guess I better start my shift.

136
00:11:32,384 --> 00:11:34,219
Have a good one.

137
00:11:34,261 --> 00:11:36,346
You too.

138
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,502
- Hey.
- Hey.

139
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,338
Hi!

140
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:25,766
- Why are you here?
- Shh.

141
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,810
What happened?

142
00:14:30,645 --> 00:14:33,190
I can't be your savior, Walter.

143
00:14:33,232 --> 00:14:34,900
I need love too.

144
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:37,652
Just one dance.

145
00:15:52,379 --> 00:15:53,379
I...

146
00:15:55,439 --> 00:15:57,441
I can't.

147
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:15,625
Thank you.

148
00:16:52,162 --> 00:16:53,622
You're early today.

149
00:16:53,663 --> 00:16:55,249
I, um...

150
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,167
I swapped my shift

151
00:16:57,209 --> 00:16:59,169
so I could be home for dinner

152
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:01,130
and eat with the family
at least once this week.

153
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:03,178
Great.

154
00:17:04,883 --> 00:17:08,178
Sylviñha, clear your books.
Go set the table.

155
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,142
So... um, how was school today?

156
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:15,894
Fine.

157
00:17:15,936 --> 00:17:17,812
Ah! Is that how you respond?

158
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:24,486
It was fine, thank you.

159
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:38,792
She's so excited to finally
be here with you.

160
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:40,252
I'm not so sure about that.

161
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:43,213
Nonsense. Of course she is.

162
00:17:48,218 --> 00:17:51,346
I was thinking, um...

163
00:17:51,388 --> 00:17:53,974
maybe we should plan some things,
as a family,

164
00:17:54,016 --> 00:17:56,393
so we could get to know each other.

165
00:17:56,435 --> 00:17:59,021
Ah, I've just been
praying about this.

166
00:17:59,063 --> 00:18:00,855
- Yes?
- Yes!

167
00:18:00,897 --> 00:18:03,984
Well, perhaps this Sunday we could
go for a drive outside of the city,

168
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:07,904
- you know, maybe the Jersey Shore or...
- Well, aren't we all going to church?

169
00:18:07,946 --> 00:18:10,657
Well, I... I thought it would be good
to leave the city early

170
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:13,827
- to, you know, avoid the traffic.
- Oh, that's fine.

171
00:18:13,868 --> 00:18:17,039
That's fine. Perhaps there's
a sunrise service we can attend.

172
00:18:17,081 --> 00:18:19,541
Of course. Um...

173
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,377
- I'll check.
- Mm.

174
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,799
Oh, yeah. I, um...

175
00:18:27,841 --> 00:18:31,886
I brought home some wine
so we can toast.

176
00:18:31,928 --> 00:18:33,597
Alcohol?

177
00:18:33,638 --> 00:18:35,640
It's wine.

178
00:18:37,934 --> 00:18:39,728
But you know we shouldn't drink.

179
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:43,273
Well, it's... It's just a...

180
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:47,736
simple wine for...

201
00:20:24,999 --> 00:20:28,462
I thank you for the gifts
of food and shelter

202
00:20:28,503 --> 00:20:31,089
that you have provided
for me and my family.

203

And I know that you...

00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:03,848
As soon as my immigration
paperwork is finalized,

205
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,475
I'll get a job

206
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:07,852
so I can help with the bills.

207
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:13,400
I can handle things for now.

208
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:15,694
You've got a lot
on your plate already.

209
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:26,330
Thank you, amor.

210
00:22:27,956 --> 00:22:31,251
For what?

211
00:22:31,293 --> 00:22:33,086
Not giving up...

212
00:22:33,127 --> 00:22:35,129
on us.

213
00:22:39,092 --> 00:22:41,761
You shouldn't thank me.

214
00:22:45,139 --> 00:22:46,933
Well.

215
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:51,730
Don't stay up late, hm?

216
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,109
Oh, and, uh...

217
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,444
did you see the mail

218
00:22:57,486 --> 00:23:00,489
that your neighbor
brought the other day?

219
00:23:02,115 --> 00:23:04,493
I don't know why it's so hard
for the mailman

220
00:23:04,534 --> 00:23:06,620
to put the mail in the correct box.

221
00:23:44,949 --> 00:23:48,077
Sylvia? Sylvia?

222
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,245
Ah!

223
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:51,080
Are you okay?

224
00:23:58,087 --> 00:24:00,173
Ow.

225
00:24:15,229 --> 00:24:17,190
I'm fine.

226
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:19,568
Then why can't you move it?

227
00:24:19,609 --> 00:24:21,695
I can. I promise.

228
00:24:21,736 --> 00:24:23,572
I can't let you go to school like this.

229
00:24:23,613 --> 00:24:26,282
You could have broken a bone.

230
00:24:26,324 --> 00:24:30,078
- I'm serious, Sylviñha.
- Are you going to tell Mama?

231
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,582
Come. We'll worry about Mama later.

232
00:24:33,623 --> 00:24:35,834
Uh, yeah,
she's still down with dialysis,

233
00:24:35,875 --> 00:24:37,154
so, that will be...

234
00:24:38,837 --> 00:24:41,465
So, you were practicing
for the dance the...

235
00:24:42,674 --> 00:24:44,843
young man told us about at your school?

236
00:24:49,263 --> 00:24:51,265
Mm-hm.

237
00:24:55,687 --> 00:25:00,274
When you stopped waiting
for my weekend phone calls...

238
00:25:04,738 --> 00:25:08,617
Mama said it was because
you were sneaking out to dance.

239
00:25:12,328 --> 00:25:14,414
That scared her.

240
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,292
Everything scares her.

241
00:25:20,837 --> 00:25:22,922
That's why she prays so much.

242
00:25:32,891 --> 00:25:35,059
You know, I used to be
quite the dancer

243
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:36,895
as well when I was younger.

244
00:25:41,733 --> 00:25:43,527
It's true!

245
00:25:43,568 --> 00:25:46,530
Okay, maybe not
that style of dance, but...

246
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:51,993
Your mother would make...

247
00:25:52,035 --> 00:25:54,663
matching outfits for the both of us,

248
00:25:54,704 --> 00:25:58,249
and we'd go to the secret parties and...

249
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:02,253
dance all night long.

250
00:26:02,295 --> 00:26:05,298
- Mae?
- Yeah.

251
00:26:05,938 --> 00:26:07,091
Eh.

252
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,886
No, we used to dance a lot

253
00:26:09,928 --> 00:26:12,931
before you were born...

254
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:15,099
and even after.

255
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:18,352
But you are too young to remember.

256
00:26:19,813 --> 00:26:21,898
And then what happened?

257
00:26:27,028 --> 00:26:29,113
The end of the war.

258
00:26:32,867 --> 00:26:34,869
Paging Dr Bisby to 3B.

259
00:26:36,162 --> 00:26:38,372
Dr Bisby to 3B.

260
00:26:52,554 --> 00:26:55,640
- Ready for the next one?
- No.

261
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:57,458
Are you ever?

262
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:02,438
Sylvia D Santos?

263
00:27:09,112 --> 00:27:10,989
Come, wake up. Let's go.

264
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:12,657
- The nurse is here.
- Hm?

265
00:27:12,699 --> 00:27:14,951
Let's go.

266
00:27:14,993 --> 00:27:16,995
Come on.

267
00:27:18,246 --> 00:27:20,081
And what brings you in today?

268
00:27:20,123 --> 00:27:21,875
She injured her arm.

269
00:27:26,838 --> 00:27:29,298
How did this injury take place?

270
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,342
I fell.

271
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:34,262
And when did the injury happen?

272
00:27:35,889 --> 00:27:38,224
Mm... yesterday.

273
00:27:42,979 --> 00:27:45,398
Where does it hurt?
Can you show me exactly?

274
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,028
- Anywhere else?
- Mm-mm.

275
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,656
There's a little bruise,
but nothing too unusual.

276
00:27:58,536 --> 00:28:01,539
The doctor is going to be
right with you.

277
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:03,291
Do you need anything?

278
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:16,554
- Linda.
- What do you want from me?

279
00:28:16,596 --> 00:28:19,348
You promised you would never
rub them in my face.

280
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:21,350
She needed help, querida.

281
00:28:21,392 --> 00:28:23,687
- I trust you.
- What do you think...

282
00:28:27,106 --> 00:28:28,900
What do you think this is?

283
00:28:28,942 --> 00:28:32,403
I... I know this is far from ideal, but...

284
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:34,989
why can't we remain friends,
like in the beginning?

285
00:28:36,115 --> 00:28:39,786
Because this is not
the beginning.

286
00:28:39,828 --> 00:28:42,163
We're far from the beginning, Walter.

287
00:28:43,581 --> 00:28:45,166
This is the end.

288
00:28:47,711 --> 00:28:49,128
I'm serious.

289
00:28:51,965 --> 00:28:54,300
I'll go get the doctor.

290
00:28:54,342 --> 00:28:56,344
Linda.

291
00:29:11,109 --> 00:29:12,694
Papa?

292
00:29:12,736 --> 00:29:14,237
Hmm?

293
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:16,698
Do you love us?

294
00:29:18,074 --> 00:29:20,451
Yes!

295
00:29:20,493 --> 00:29:23,621
And you left to make a life for us, right?

296
00:29:23,663 --> 00:29:26,540
Well, of course.

297
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:44,786
Oh, Sylvia.

298
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:48,039
I was just, um...

299
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:50,374
taking out the trash.

300
00:30:55,629 --> 00:30:57,381
Do you need anything?

301
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:19,946
- Oh, Sylvia.
- Wow!

302
00:31:19,988 --> 00:31:21,906
Look at this.

303
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,867
Big girl.

304
00:31:23,908 --> 00:31:26,828
Let me see. Let me see!

305
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:29,080
Huh? What?

306
00:31:30,664 --> 00:31:33,251
She's grown. She has.

307
00:31:38,798 --> 00:31:40,800
I need to use the bathroom.

308
00:31:40,842 --> 00:31:42,844
The light is on the wall
to your left.

309
00:32:24,988 --> 00:32:26,595
- Hey, girl.
- Hey.

310
00:32:26,637 --> 00:32:29,723
You'll probably be seducing
some hot New York dude

311
00:32:29,765 --> 00:32:31,434
by the time you get this.

312
00:32:31,475 --> 00:32:33,895
I told Rajab to just forget about you.

313
00:32:33,937 --> 00:32:35,313
I mean, please!

314
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:37,356
- Sylvia?
- Eh!

315
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:44,738
She's off to greener pastures
called New York.

316
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,282
He's so depressed!

317
00:32:46,324 --> 00:32:48,492
Imagine that I've missed you.

318
00:32:48,534 --> 00:32:51,829
I'm going to keep making
those remixes for my girl

319
00:32:51,871 --> 00:32:55,333
so when you become the most
famous dancer in America,

320
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:58,752
the rest of us
can at least be in your entourage!

321
00:33:01,589 --> 00:33:03,925
Good morning, Mae.

322
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:12,475
Hey. Ah!

323
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:14,602
I thought we talked about those.

324
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:21,734
I don't know why you insist
on wearing those ugly boots

325
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:24,570
all the time. You're so pretty.

326
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:36,332
All the children at your school
will think Africans are tacky.

327
00:33:36,374 --> 00:33:38,584
These are my
comfortable shoes, Ma.

328
00:33:38,626 --> 00:33:39,835
Want me to be uncomfortable?

329
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:43,172
As soon as I get a job, I'll take you
shopping to get some proper clothes.

330
00:33:44,257 --> 00:33:46,259
We won't bother your father
about that right now.

331
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Hm? Hmm?

332
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,682
Good morning.

333
00:33:55,935 --> 00:33:58,312
Morning.

334
00:34:38,019 --> 00:34:40,604
Yo, so we're having a dance cypher.

335
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:42,731
I don't know if you want to participate,

336
00:34:42,773 --> 00:34:45,568
- if you dance or anything.
- You guys can go in.

337
00:34:51,865 --> 00:34:54,702
Thank you.

338
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,996
I'm here to enroll my daughter.

339
00:34:57,038 --> 00:34:59,457
Oh, yes. Do you speak English, honey?

340
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,708
Yes, but she's...

341
00:35:00,749 --> 00:35:03,169
she's still adjusting
to the American accent.

342
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:05,296
Okay. Um, and I see

343
00:35:05,338 --> 00:35:10,676
we're still missing...
an official birth certificate.

344
00:35:10,718 --> 00:35:14,263
- We have this.
- This is... a letter.

345
00:35:14,305 --> 00:35:15,639
Yes.

346
00:35:15,681 --> 00:35:18,851
I explained when I telephoned
that Sylvia was born

347
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:21,645
during the civil war in our country,

348
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:25,274
and both the hospital and
Department of Records were destroyed,

349
00:35:25,316 --> 00:35:29,195
so we don't have
any original birth papers.

350
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,366
Okay.

351
00:35:33,407 --> 00:35:36,952
I'll have Ms Tunnie enroll you
and take you to class.

352
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:40,456
- So, she starts right now?
- Yes!

353
00:35:40,498 --> 00:35:42,541
You can pick her up
at 3:30 after school.

354
00:35:43,312 --> 00:35:45,128
- Office.
- Hi, it's me.

355
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:14,948
Hey. Yo. You got moves.

356
00:36:18,536 --> 00:36:20,538
Hey, wait. Where you going?

357
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,831
Weren't you just
waiting for your bus?

358
00:36:22,873 --> 00:36:25,709
Yo! Chill out. Calm down.

359
00:36:25,751 --> 00:36:28,212
Why you acting like that?
Yo, yo, yo.

360
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:31,382
Chill out, will you?

361
00:36:31,424 --> 00:36:33,092
Can we, um, start over?

362
00:36:34,677 --> 00:36:37,971
Hi, I'm Devon,
but most people call me DJ.

363
00:36:40,974 --> 00:36:43,436
Hi, I'm Sylvia.

364
00:36:43,477 --> 00:36:45,729
Everyone calls me Sylvia.

365
00:36:45,771 --> 00:36:47,856
Hey, Sylvia.

366
00:36:49,442 --> 00:36:51,444
From Angola?

367
00:36:53,237 --> 00:36:56,365
Family new to the States or...

368
00:36:56,407 --> 00:36:58,992
Yes. Um, no.

369
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:00,703
My father was here before.

370
00:37:00,744 --> 00:37:03,622
He's a...

371
00:37:03,664 --> 00:37:07,000
- diplomat.
- Wow. Okay, cool.

372
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:12,089
- You dance?
- Why do you accuse me of this?

373
00:37:13,507 --> 00:37:15,259
Just, mostly girls
on the step team wear those.

374
00:37:17,386 --> 00:37:19,472
Well, I do know for a fact

375
00:37:19,513 --> 00:37:22,766
that the step team needs another stepper
for the dance cypher if you're interested.

376
00:37:24,727 --> 00:37:26,520
What is this prize?

377
00:37:26,562 --> 00:37:29,607
It's $1,000 for best soloist
and best team.

378
00:37:31,775 --> 00:37:34,195
- No.
- Why not?

379
00:37:34,237 --> 00:37:35,863
- I don't know the steps.
- That's easy.

380
00:37:35,904 --> 00:37:38,241
You just look up videos
on YouTube,

381
00:37:38,282 --> 00:37:39,825
use the videos to practice.

382
00:37:39,867 --> 00:37:41,160
You just have to know
how to dance.

383
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:46,790
Fine.

384
00:37:46,832 --> 00:37:49,668
If I agree to look at these steps,

385
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,086
will you let me pass?

386
00:37:56,008 --> 00:37:58,010
I'll see you later, Sylvia.

387
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:40,469
We should go to the market
this weekend and...

388
00:38:40,511 --> 00:38:42,888
get some bananas.

389
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,972
Mm-hm.

390
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,646
Oh, and something without
cholesterol for your father.

391
00:38:50,688 --> 00:38:53,982
Have you seen the way he eats?
Eesh.

392
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:04,076
Is that Neema?

393
00:39:04,117 --> 00:39:05,869
Did she get married?

394
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,455
Not yet.

395
00:39:07,496 --> 00:39:09,873
One day you'll meet a nice boy.

396
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:11,208
Hey, maybe in university.

397
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:14,169
That's how I met
your father, you know?

398
00:39:14,211 --> 00:39:15,363
Yes.

399
00:39:17,214 --> 00:39:20,926
He was studying journalism.
You were studying social sciences,

400
00:39:20,968 --> 00:39:23,304
and you both suspected
each other of being Communist.

401
00:39:25,138 --> 00:39:27,475
He got on my nerves so much,

402
00:39:27,516 --> 00:39:30,143
always talking about politics
the whole night.

403
00:39:30,185 --> 00:39:31,354
I...

404
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:35,649
Well, I told you this story
too many times.

405
00:39:35,691 --> 00:39:37,443
Mm.

406
00:39:37,485 --> 00:39:40,446
He's a good man, Viñha, loyal.

407
00:39:41,864 --> 00:39:43,866
Yes, Mae.

408
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:54,543
It's not his fault
that we had to wait so many years.

409
00:39:55,753 --> 00:39:57,755
You know he tried everything.

410
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,882
Why didn't he come back home, then?

411
00:40:02,134 --> 00:40:04,762
Because we wanted you
to have the life

412
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,889
that we couldn't have.

413
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:09,975
Huh?

414
00:40:14,187 --> 00:40:15,981
I don't want you to suffer anymore.

415
00:40:20,653 --> 00:40:24,072
Look, all those days
are behind us now.

416
00:40:24,114 --> 00:40:25,908
Okay?

417
00:40:25,949 --> 00:40:29,620
Everything is going to be fine, I promise.

418
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:32,498
God is good.

419
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:34,625
Hm?

420
00:40:39,296 --> 00:40:40,839
All right, today's topic,

421
00:40:40,881 --> 00:40:42,716
Immigration and emigration, right?

422
00:40:42,758 --> 00:40:44,134
We have two different lists.

423
00:40:44,176 --> 00:40:46,637
I want you all to turn to page 25...

424
00:40:47,805 --> 00:40:51,850
and then go down,
look at the two different lists, okay?

425
00:40:51,892 --> 00:40:54,186
Oh, Mr Jameson, you're late.

426
00:40:54,227 --> 00:40:56,058
Sorry for being late, Mr Uno.

427
00:40:56,083 --> 00:41:00,108
Okay, immigration,
life quality, religious freedom.

428
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,944
Take out a piece of paper,
and I want you

429
00:41:01,985 --> 00:41:04,321
to start writing down
two different definitions...

430
00:41:04,363 --> 00:41:08,617
Hey, DJ, what's your
African girlfriend wearing?

431
00:41:08,659 --> 00:41:10,536
All right, Denise, settle down.

432
00:41:10,578 --> 00:41:11,829
Everybody settle down.

433
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:13,789
Okay, is everybody
turned to page 25?

434
00:41:13,831 --> 00:41:17,250
Okay. Yes. Mr Jameson,
please turn the pages.

435
00:41:17,292 --> 00:41:19,545
Okay, here we go,
immigration, first list.

436
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:55,163
Sylvia.

437
00:41:55,205 --> 00:41:57,791
Sylvia.

438
00:41:57,816 --> 00:41:59,502
Ah! Ah!

439
00:41:59,543 --> 00:42:02,838
You okay? I tried calling,
but you didn't hear me.

440
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,882
- What were you...
- It's nothing. It's nothing.

441
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:06,341
You could have injured yourself.

442
00:42:06,383 --> 00:42:08,093
I was exercising.

443
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:40,375
If we believe,
we shall receive whatever we ask for.

444
00:42:40,417 --> 00:42:44,505
Your mother suggested
that maybe we should...

445
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:48,926
I mean, I should try and talk to you
just to see if everything was all right.

446
00:42:50,427 --> 00:42:53,806
That you lift me up so that
I may better serve you,

447
00:42:53,847 --> 00:42:56,975
to weather the storm, to continue to...

448
00:42:57,017 --> 00:43:00,270
How long has she been so,
uh, religious?

449
00:43:00,312 --> 00:43:02,648
When we moved to Tanzania.

450
00:43:04,775 --> 00:43:06,569
At first she just wanted us
to have a community,

451
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:08,779
but then she got really serious about it.

452
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:10,864
And you?

453
00:43:10,906 --> 00:43:12,991
As long as I'm reading the Bible,

454
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:15,452
she doesn't get on my case too much.

455
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:24,795
And do you miss home?

456
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:28,340
Don't you?

457
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:32,678
Well, after the war, the...

458
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:35,598
the home that I knew was gone.

459
00:43:41,729 --> 00:43:45,649
Do you mind
if I snooze in the chair,

460
00:43:45,691 --> 00:43:47,985
while I wait for her to finish?

461
00:43:48,026 --> 00:43:51,864
Oh, Mama will be upset
if she knows I didn't give you my bed.

462
00:43:51,905 --> 00:43:55,033
Oh, no, no, no.
She doesn't have to know.

463
00:43:57,202 --> 00:44:00,288
Thank you, because you...

464
00:44:05,794 --> 00:44:08,171
Lord, I ask...

465
00:44:09,548 --> 00:44:11,383
I can turn off the light.

466
00:44:11,424 --> 00:44:13,426
No, no, no, keep exercising.

467
00:44:15,012 --> 00:44:17,014
I was finished.

468
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:24,813
Give me the strength
to weather the storm.

469
00:44:29,568 --> 00:44:30,611
Sylviñha.

470
00:44:32,655 --> 00:44:33,864
Yes, Pai?

471
00:44:35,574 --> 00:44:39,202
This country...

472
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,914
is very hard for black people,

473
00:44:43,123 --> 00:44:45,167
especially foreigners.

474
00:44:45,208 --> 00:44:49,588
You always have to...
carry yourself a certain way,

475
00:44:49,630 --> 00:44:54,551
so that white people...
don't feel threatened.

476
00:44:54,593 --> 00:44:57,888
So, when we get to dance,

477
00:44:57,930 --> 00:45:00,098
that's the one place where I can

478
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,143
actually be myself...

479
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,105
...show myself.

480
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:12,569
So, be yourself.

481
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:15,155
You are the only one
who knows what you know...

482
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:20,327
...and who can do what you do.

483
00:45:26,917 --> 00:45:28,460
Yes, Pai.

484
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,806
Because if we ask in prayer...

485
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:01,952
It's the one that you sent to Mama
when we first moved to Tanzania.

486
00:46:04,788 --> 00:46:07,708
I liked it, so she let me wear it.

487
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:19,427
Anywhere else?

488
00:46:19,469 --> 00:46:22,305
It's a little bruised,
but nothing too unusual.

489
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:58,717
Where did you learn this song?

490
00:46:58,759 --> 00:47:02,512
At the Angolan parties
in Dar-es-Salaam.

491
00:47:02,554 --> 00:47:05,557
Everybody would dance to it
and cry, cry, cry.

492
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:11,229
That's when Mama
stopped going to the parties.

493
00:47:13,148 --> 00:47:15,275
Then she didn't want me
to dance anymore.

494
00:47:28,038 --> 00:47:31,291
Can I get an apartment
for $1,000?

495
00:47:31,333 --> 00:47:33,543
I mean, depends where,
but, yeah, you could.

496
00:47:33,585 --> 00:47:36,421
Why, you planning
on running away or something?

497
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:43,678
I'm just planning
for the future.

498
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,848
You got this.

499
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:48,100
Thanks.

500
00:48:06,243 --> 00:48:08,703
- Pay attention.
- Sorry.

501
00:48:14,251 --> 00:48:16,628
Five, six, seven. Here we go.

502
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,842
What are you doing?
What was that?

503
00:48:21,884 --> 00:48:24,011
Oh, nothing.
It was just something...

504
00:48:24,052 --> 00:48:26,263
- Did you see me do that?
- No. I...

505
00:48:26,304 --> 00:48:28,932
Then don't do that.
We have a routine.

506
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:31,143
All we need is someone
to learn the routine and execute it

507
00:48:31,184 --> 00:48:34,146
the way it needs to be done.
Now, can you do that or not?

508
00:48:41,278 --> 00:48:43,989
- Yo, what the...
- Get away from me.

509
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,657
- What happened?
- I told you I can't step,

510
00:48:45,698 --> 00:48:49,286
but you insisted,
and now you've embarrassed me.

511
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,412
Calm down.

512
00:48:50,453 --> 00:48:52,039
I saw you up there
learning the moves.

513
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,373
You were doing great.

514
00:48:53,415 --> 00:48:55,000
Well, your friend
has a problem with me,

515
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,294
because she keep poking,
poking, poking me like I'm...

516
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:59,421
like I'm a shish-kebab.

517
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:10,432
Oh, boy.

518
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:13,351
Okay, come on.

519
00:49:13,393 --> 00:49:16,479
Let me take
your shish-kebab ass home.

520
00:49:16,521 --> 00:49:17,814
Jesus.

521
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:25,530
Mae?

522
00:49:47,344 --> 00:49:49,637
- The bathroom is down there.
- Cool.

523
00:49:55,894 --> 00:49:59,522
Sorry it's a mess.
I don't usually have guests.

524
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:01,483
Nah, it's cool. It's cool.

525
00:50:03,568 --> 00:50:05,570
Who's that?

526
00:50:08,115 --> 00:50:10,617
That's Neema,

527
00:50:10,658 --> 00:50:13,161
my best friend from back home.

528
00:50:13,203 --> 00:50:14,704
She's a DJ.

529
00:50:14,746 --> 00:50:16,915
Huh. Well, word.

530
00:50:19,126 --> 00:50:21,128
You miss it there?

531
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:25,465
Uh...

532
00:50:25,507 --> 00:50:29,427
my friends think my life is perfect now,

533
00:50:29,469 --> 00:50:32,472
that I'm hanging out
with celebrities and crazy partying.

534
00:50:32,514 --> 00:50:36,059
All my family's down south,
so, you know, I get the same thing.

535
00:50:37,602 --> 00:50:39,604
Nobody here really knows
what it's like there,

536
00:50:39,646 --> 00:50:44,026
so, you just... feel alone.

537
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:46,069
What about your parents?

538
00:50:47,445 --> 00:50:48,821
They're complicated.

539
00:50:51,574 --> 00:50:54,369
My dad...

540
00:50:54,411 --> 00:50:56,329
he isn't really a diplomat.

541
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,833
I figured.
You know, you don't really hear

542
00:51:00,875 --> 00:51:03,878
about too many diplomats
living in the 'hood, so.

543
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:06,345
Yeah.

544
00:51:08,008 --> 00:51:09,467
But...

545
00:51:09,509 --> 00:51:12,262
I also grew up without my pops, so...

546
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,765
I know how it feels.

547
00:51:20,937 --> 00:51:23,856
So, uh, what are you going
to do after graduation?

548
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:29,654
I don't know, maybe start working,

549
00:51:29,696 --> 00:51:31,156
go to a state college or something.

550
00:51:31,198 --> 00:51:34,701
You're not going to continue
with the stage lights and promotion?

551
00:51:34,742 --> 00:51:37,370
Well, not unless you become
a famous dancer, Miss Sylvia.

552
00:51:39,276 --> 00:51:40,523
Sylvia.

553
00:51:40,548 --> 00:51:43,626
Sorry, Mama,
I didn't know you were...

554
00:51:43,668 --> 00:51:46,379
- Um, hi, ma'am.
I'm, uh, Devon Jameson.

555
00:51:46,421 --> 00:51:49,966
How are you, Devon Jameson?

556
00:51:50,008 --> 00:51:52,135
I'm, um... I'm good.

557
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:55,180
- You have a lovely home, ma'am.
- You've seen my home?

558
00:51:55,222 --> 00:51:56,306
Just... just the bathroom.

559
00:51:56,348 --> 00:51:58,558
Sorry, Mama,
I didn't know you were home.

560
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:01,478
So, you brought a man home
when you thought I wasn't home?

561
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,520
No, Mae.

562
00:52:02,562 --> 00:52:03,771
I just wanted to make sure

563
00:52:03,813 --> 00:52:07,212
that Sylvia got home safe
after dance try-outs.

564
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:10,112
Anyway, I probably should be heading home

565
00:52:10,153 --> 00:52:11,738
to do some homework.

566
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:13,531
Yes.

567
00:52:13,573 --> 00:52:15,033
Oh, say hello to your parents.

568
00:52:16,368 --> 00:52:17,785
Okay.

569
00:52:17,827 --> 00:52:20,330
I'll see you tomorrow.

570
00:52:20,372 --> 00:52:22,749
Excuse me, ma'am.

571
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:26,211
We didn't do anything, Mama.
He just escorted me home.

572
00:52:55,948 --> 00:52:58,368
Viñha...

573
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:01,663
your father and I
are going out to dinner tonight.

574
00:53:11,964 --> 00:53:15,009
I don't know what's gotten into you,

575
00:53:15,051 --> 00:53:17,262
but I expected better.

576
00:53:17,304 --> 00:53:19,306
You know I only do this
for your own good

577
00:53:19,347 --> 00:53:22,767
because I can see things you can't.

578
00:53:22,809 --> 00:53:26,229
Your father and I are doing
our best to protect you.

579
00:53:41,328 --> 00:53:45,039
From now on, you go to school...

580
00:53:45,081 --> 00:53:47,834
and you come straight back.

581
00:53:47,875 --> 00:53:51,003
No friends, no activities...

582
00:53:51,045 --> 00:53:54,048
and no dancing.

583
00:53:58,636 --> 00:54:00,638
Are you listening?

584
00:54:09,231 --> 00:54:12,984
This hurts me more
than it hurts you...

585
00:54:13,025 --> 00:54:18,240
but you will repent and seek
forgiveness for what you did.

586
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:40,803
Our father...

587
00:54:40,845 --> 00:54:43,306
which art in heaven,

588
00:54:43,348 --> 00:54:44,891
hallowed by thy name.

589
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:47,685
Thy kingdom come,

590
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:52,524
thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

591
00:54:52,565 --> 00:54:55,818
Give us this day our daily bread

592
00:54:55,860 --> 00:55:00,156
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive...

593
00:55:00,198 --> 00:55:02,409
- Esther, what is she doing...
- Nuh-uh.

594
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:07,914
I will not lose my daughter
to this country.

595
00:55:07,955 --> 00:55:10,833
For thine is the kingdom
and the power

596
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:16,005
and the glory forever and ever.

597
00:55:16,047 --> 00:55:20,134
Our father which art in heaven,

598
00:55:20,176 --> 00:55:22,887
hallowed be thy name.

599
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:25,890
Thy kingdom come, thy will be...

600
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,860
Family is here now.

601
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:41,030
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

602
00:55:41,072 --> 00:55:43,074
And this one is for you.

603
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:46,703
Come.

604
00:55:48,037 --> 00:55:49,664
Can you believe it?

605
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,428
For the gifts of food,
for the gifts of shelter

606
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:48,306
that you have provided
for me and my family.

607
00:56:49,807 --> 00:56:51,643
Praise Jesus for this day,

608
00:56:51,684 --> 00:56:54,061
and may my path
be free from trouble

609
00:56:54,103 --> 00:56:56,773
and the destructive
hand of Satan.

610
00:56:56,814 --> 00:56:58,816
May I return safely from school,

611
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:01,778
and may Daddy return safely
from America...

612
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:04,238
I mean, work.

613
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,700
- Amen.
- Amen.

614
00:57:07,742 --> 00:57:10,495
It's a passage of scripture

615
00:57:10,537 --> 00:57:12,455
that's always fascinated me.

616
00:58:02,254 --> 00:58:05,174
Because you disappeared!

617
00:58:05,216 --> 00:58:08,219
I'm the fool, right? I'm the fool.
Like, you're never accountable.

618
00:58:10,304 --> 00:58:13,224
You don't get to drop out
of people's lives for...

619
00:58:17,479 --> 00:58:19,481
What were you thinking?

620
00:58:25,487 --> 00:58:28,531
You know what?

621
00:58:28,573 --> 00:58:30,116
You always do this,

622
00:58:30,157 --> 00:58:33,327
and I should have listened
to my astrologer.

623
00:58:33,369 --> 00:58:35,788
I should have listened to my spirit.

624
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:39,667
Because this is Aries bullshit,
so narcissistic.

625
00:58:39,709 --> 00:58:40,843
It's so...

626
00:58:43,713 --> 00:58:45,882
And you know what?
I don't have time for this.

627
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:49,176
I don't have
the psychic bandwidth.

628
00:58:49,218 --> 00:58:50,720
You know what's so effed up?

629
00:58:50,762 --> 00:58:53,347
Is that we have to effing work together!

630
00:58:57,519 --> 00:58:59,479
All right.
You know what? We're done.

631
00:58:59,521 --> 00:59:01,523
Come and get your shit.

632
00:59:11,323 --> 00:59:12,534
Who is it?

633
00:59:12,575 --> 00:59:14,911
Nzingha from next door.

634
00:59:17,329 --> 00:59:19,331
Just a moment.

635
00:59:24,336 --> 00:59:27,089
Oh.

636
00:59:27,131 --> 00:59:29,509
Uh, is Walter...

637
00:59:29,551 --> 00:59:30,968
Walter still live here?

638
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:34,055
I'm afraid he's at work
at the moment.

639
00:59:34,096 --> 00:59:37,767
- I'm his wife, Esther.
- Oh, okay.

640
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:41,896
- Pleased to meet you, queen.
- Pleased to meet you too...

641
00:59:41,938 --> 00:59:43,022
queen?

642
00:59:43,064 --> 00:59:45,608
Excuse me.
I was just cleaning the house,

643
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,026
but you're welcome
to come inside.

644
00:59:47,068 --> 00:59:48,235
Oh, no, sis.

645
00:59:48,277 --> 00:59:51,155
I just wanted to drop off
some mail that was put in my box.

646
00:59:51,197 --> 00:59:53,491
I will make sure I give them
to my husband when he comes home.

647
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:55,242
Okay. Peace.

648
01:00:12,218 --> 01:00:14,345
"He who is brought together in the Lord,

649
01:00:14,386 --> 01:00:17,515
let no man tear asunder."

650
01:00:17,557 --> 01:00:19,475
You know my heart, Lord.

651
01:00:19,517 --> 01:00:21,853
You know my struggles.

652
01:00:24,564 --> 01:00:26,357
It's the word of God
that we need to follow,

653
01:00:26,398 --> 01:00:27,817
taking in his...

654
01:00:27,859 --> 01:00:30,444
Some of us are trying
to lead our families,

655
01:00:30,486 --> 01:00:32,614
which, when the temptation...

656
01:01:08,024 --> 01:01:11,443
- How are you, queen?
- Fine, thank you.

657
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:13,529
- You been shopping?
- Mm-hm.

658
01:01:13,571 --> 01:01:15,447
Did you go to the Korean market
on the corner?

659
01:01:15,489 --> 01:01:17,784
Sometimes their food
isn't always so fresh.

660
01:01:17,825 --> 01:01:20,578
I was looking
for some millet flour for Walter.

661
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:22,121
He has the cholesterol, so.

662
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:24,707
You know, I can take you to the
Egyptian market where I get my food.

663
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:27,627
- I'm headed there now.
- No, no, no, I don't want to disturb.

664
01:01:27,669 --> 01:01:29,086
Sis, it's really no problem.

665
01:01:40,181 --> 01:01:43,142
The neighborhood
has changed dramatically,

666
01:01:43,184 --> 01:01:45,853
used to have
a lot of our people.

667
01:01:45,895 --> 01:01:47,396
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

668
01:01:49,398 --> 01:01:50,692
It's very busy.

669
01:01:50,733 --> 01:01:52,819
Yeah, it's very busy.

670
01:01:54,361 --> 01:01:57,699
- As-salaam alaikum.
- As-salaam alaikum.

671
01:02:01,146 --> 01:02:02,161
Mm.

672
01:02:02,203 --> 01:02:03,245
Smell.

673
01:02:05,063 --> 01:02:06,874
Nice.

674
01:02:06,916 --> 01:02:08,876
You eat very healthy?

675
01:02:08,918 --> 01:02:11,629
Ah, you know, I try.

676
01:02:11,671 --> 01:02:13,005
I'm doing much better, though,

677
01:02:13,047 --> 01:02:15,466
now that I'm not in a relationship.

678
01:02:15,507 --> 01:02:18,845
I am just grateful that I am
finally reunited with Walter

679
01:02:18,886 --> 01:02:21,639
after so many years apart.

680
01:02:21,681 --> 01:02:23,725
- Mm.
- He must have struggled a lot.

681
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:25,517
I was wondering how he learned

682
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:29,271
how to cook
all these low-fat foods.

683
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:30,898
Maybe you helped him.

684
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:32,358
You know how men are.

685
01:02:32,399 --> 01:02:34,526
They know how
to find their resources.

686
01:02:39,115 --> 01:02:41,826
Was there a woman named Linda
who lived in the apartment

687
01:02:41,868 --> 01:02:44,203
before Walter moved in?

688
01:02:44,245 --> 01:02:45,621
- Oh...
- Yes?

689
01:02:45,663 --> 01:02:47,539
Did you get more
ashwagandha powder this week?

690
01:02:47,581 --> 01:02:49,917
- No, ma'am.
- No?

691
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:51,377
You know what?

692
01:02:51,418 --> 01:02:53,671
Sometimes it takes them
so long to restock their items,

693
01:02:53,713 --> 01:02:57,800
but I really want to support
the local business, you know?

694
01:02:57,842 --> 01:03:02,263
And these brothers are African, so.

695
01:03:02,304 --> 01:03:04,223
You know what?
We should head back.

696
01:03:04,265 --> 01:03:06,726
Did you get your flour?

697
01:03:06,768 --> 01:03:08,853
- Yes, thank you.
- Okay.

698
01:03:21,407 --> 01:03:23,743
Thank you, Lord.

699
01:03:34,461 --> 01:03:37,506
You have 30 minutes for this call.

700
01:03:37,548 --> 01:03:40,718
May your name be praised.

701
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,511
May your name...

702
01:03:44,013 --> 01:03:46,098
Hello?

703
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,769
Sister Redempta?

704
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:52,104
Ah, my Esther!

705
01:03:52,146 --> 01:03:55,900
How are you settling in?

706
01:03:55,942 --> 01:03:57,985
Oh.

707
01:03:58,027 --> 01:04:01,238
Oh, it is a challenge, my sister.

708
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:03,282
I'm home mostly by myself,

709
01:04:03,324 --> 01:04:08,037
so, usually, I'm just thinking, thinking,

710
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:10,247
missing my community there.

711
01:04:23,219 --> 01:04:27,306
How is our Sylvia doing over there?

712
01:04:27,348 --> 01:04:29,934
Oh, she's trying her best.

713
01:04:29,976 --> 01:04:33,855
Show us the Wakanda symbol one time.

714
01:04:33,896 --> 01:04:36,398
In Jesus' name, protect Sylvia.

715
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,400
Please guide her.

716
01:04:43,447 --> 01:04:45,825
And how is Walter?

717
01:04:45,867 --> 01:04:47,618
Oh, he's...

718
01:04:49,829 --> 01:04:52,081
He's working very hard.

719
01:04:52,123 --> 01:04:54,416
His life here is so difficult.

720
01:04:54,458 --> 01:04:56,127
I don't believe we've met.

721
01:04:56,168 --> 01:04:58,295
I usually come on weekdays

722
01:04:58,337 --> 01:05:00,965
because I mostly work on Sundays.

723
01:05:01,007 --> 01:05:03,217
Oh. Welcome to our flock.

724
01:05:09,932 --> 01:05:14,436
But I'm trying my best
to help him and to pray for him.

725
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:18,690
Protect Walter and guide him, please.

726
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:22,862
He is the head, father God.

727
01:05:22,904 --> 01:05:24,780
I am proud of you, my sister.

728
01:05:24,822 --> 01:05:28,159
You endured many,
many years of hardship

729
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,495
and stayed faithful to God's command.

730
01:05:34,706 --> 01:05:37,251
Don't forget to send your offerings.

731
01:05:37,293 --> 01:05:39,461
We must always give thanks,

732
01:05:39,503 --> 01:05:42,924
especially when God
answers our prayers.

733
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:11,618
No, I'm... I'm not hungry.

734
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:17,875
I thought you might say that,
so I made you a flask of tea

735
01:06:17,917 --> 01:06:22,004
with some rolls today.
Very little sugar.

736
01:06:22,046 --> 01:06:26,008
Oh, you work so hard
to look after us.

737
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,552
Allow me to now look after you, hm?

738
01:06:31,472 --> 01:06:33,349
Thank you.

739
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:35,267
That's very nice.

740
01:06:37,561 --> 01:06:39,688
No, but thank you.

741
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:47,113
And you? How was your day?

742
01:06:47,154 --> 01:06:50,199
Oh, you know, the usual things.

743
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,328
I had a question.

744
01:06:54,370 --> 01:06:57,789
I had some money that I kept
in case of an emergency,

745
01:06:57,831 --> 01:07:00,417
and I thought maybe
you could help me

746
01:07:00,459 --> 01:07:03,712
send it to our church
in Dar-es-Salaam.

747
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:06,590
They have been praying for us
for so many years.

748
01:07:06,632 --> 01:07:10,552
It would be a offering of thanks.

749
01:07:11,845 --> 01:07:12,846
Okay.

750
01:07:12,888 --> 01:07:15,391
I can send it
during my lunch break tomorrow.

751
01:07:15,432 --> 01:07:17,809
There's a transfer place near work.

752
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:19,395
That's wonderful!

753
01:07:38,539 --> 01:07:40,082
How much money is this?

754
01:07:40,124 --> 01:07:41,625
$1,000.

755
01:07:41,667 --> 01:07:44,461
You're s... you're sending
the church $1,000?

756
01:07:44,503 --> 01:07:45,504
Yes.

757
01:07:45,546 --> 01:07:46,964
This is for several years.

758
01:07:47,006 --> 01:07:48,924
I kept it in case
of an emergency,

759
01:07:48,966 --> 01:07:50,551
but now that God
has delivered us...

760
01:07:50,592 --> 01:07:53,887
He hasn't.
He hasn't delivered us.

761
01:07:53,929 --> 01:07:57,183
Amor... we are here.

762
01:07:57,224 --> 01:07:59,851
Yes, yes, yes, and do you
know what that means?

763
01:07:59,893 --> 01:08:01,270
It means I have to work harder
than before,

764
01:08:01,312 --> 01:08:02,604
and we have less than before.

765
01:08:02,646 --> 01:08:04,231
- But this...
- All this time I have been...

766
01:08:04,273 --> 01:08:06,817
I've been working
double and triple shifts.

767
01:08:06,858 --> 01:08:08,610
Do you know what we could
have done with this money?

768
01:08:08,652 --> 01:08:12,864
This money is for God, querido,

769
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,368
so that he will favor us as...

770
01:08:16,410 --> 01:08:18,579
As we rebuild our family,

771
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:20,831
our marriage.

772
01:08:22,624 --> 01:08:24,876
I can't deal with this right now.

773
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,527
Here you go.

774
01:08:50,569 --> 01:08:52,279
- Thank you.
- Next.

775
01:08:52,321 --> 01:08:54,656
Yes, I'd like to send this money

776
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:57,243
to Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania.

777
01:08:57,284 --> 01:08:59,286
Your ID?

778
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:16,928
Sister Redempta?

779
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,389
How are you, my child?

780
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,807
I sent the money, but...

781
01:09:20,849 --> 01:09:23,894
Mm. What is the problem?

782
01:09:23,935 --> 01:09:26,188
Tell me what is in your heart.

783
01:09:27,648 --> 01:09:29,650
It's just...

784
01:09:32,153 --> 01:09:34,696
I think...

785
01:09:34,738 --> 01:09:37,824
I... I think we...

786
01:09:37,866 --> 01:09:39,910
might be...

787
01:09:39,951 --> 01:09:42,496
unequally yoked.

788
01:09:42,538 --> 01:09:44,540
Unequally yoked?

789
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:45,916
Da?

790
01:09:45,957 --> 01:09:47,293
Yes, Sister.

791
01:09:48,794 --> 01:09:51,255
What can I do?

792
01:09:51,297 --> 01:09:54,133
He is the man
that God has given me, and...

793
01:09:55,592 --> 01:09:58,262
why would he do that
if there wasn't a reason for it?

794
01:09:59,805 --> 01:10:04,601
God will not lead you
to the desert and abandon you.

795
01:10:05,686 --> 01:10:10,482
The dutiful wife who prays
for husband and family

796
01:10:10,524 --> 01:10:12,984
will be heard first.

797
01:10:13,026 --> 01:10:15,821
Continue to pray.

798
01:10:15,862 --> 01:10:18,574
Increase your offering.

799
01:10:18,615 --> 01:10:20,451
You cannot give up.

800
01:10:20,492 --> 01:10:24,621
Now, bow your head.
Let's pray together.

801
01:10:24,663 --> 01:10:30,001
Heavenly Father, we come
before you with Sister Esther.

802
01:10:30,043 --> 01:10:34,506
Lord, we ask you to give her peace...

803
01:11:02,576 --> 01:11:04,453
Mae?

804
01:11:45,035 --> 01:11:46,203
You're not going to continue

805
01:11:46,245 --> 01:11:49,080
with the stage lights
and promotion?

806
01:11:49,122 --> 01:11:51,458
Not unless you become
a famous dancer, Miss Sylvia.

807
01:11:55,546 --> 01:11:58,048
Sylvia.

808
01:11:58,089 --> 01:11:59,675
She's a teenager.

809
01:11:59,716 --> 01:12:01,302
It's her job to annoy us.

810
01:12:01,343 --> 01:12:04,721
- Mm.- She'll just calm down.

811
01:12:04,763 --> 01:12:06,557
Let's just take a moment.

812
01:12:06,598 --> 01:12:08,684
Let's... let's go out to dinner
so we can talk.

813
01:12:08,725 --> 01:12:10,894
I don't think you understand,
Walter.

814
01:12:10,936 --> 01:12:13,814
This is not a time
for going out to dinner.

815
01:12:13,855 --> 01:12:15,899
Clearly, we need to be at home
watching our daughter.

816
01:12:22,864 --> 01:12:25,492
- Who?
- Esther.

817
01:12:25,534 --> 01:12:26,868
Who?

818
01:12:26,910 --> 01:12:28,662
Esther!

819
01:12:28,704 --> 01:12:31,081
Walter's wife.

820
01:12:33,584 --> 01:12:35,711
Hey, queen. How are you?

821
01:12:35,752 --> 01:12:38,046
Oh, fine, thank you.

822
01:12:38,088 --> 01:12:40,966
I, um... I wanted to ask you
a favor, please, my sister.

823
01:12:41,007 --> 01:12:42,217
Mm-hm?

824
01:12:42,259 --> 01:12:44,219
I'm going to dinner
with Walter tonight,

825
01:12:44,261 --> 01:12:46,305
and I... I need to borrow

826
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:48,432
just a purse
to go with this outfit.

827
01:12:50,476 --> 01:12:53,479
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

828
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:56,690
Girl, you're... you're gonna need
way more than just a purse.

829
01:12:56,732 --> 01:12:59,067
Mm-mm. Come on.

830
01:13:00,944 --> 01:13:02,279
Come on.

831
01:13:04,865 --> 01:13:08,702
So, where are you
going for dinner?

832
01:13:08,744 --> 01:13:11,413
Well, I'm not sure.
He didn't tell me.

833
01:13:11,455 --> 01:13:14,333
Oh, so, it's a surprise.

834
01:13:14,375 --> 01:13:16,585
All right. That's nice of him!

835
01:13:16,627 --> 01:13:20,714
Well, actually, we have been
talking about this for a while,

836
01:13:20,756 --> 01:13:24,092
but... today's not really
a good day for it.

837
01:13:24,134 --> 01:13:25,677
That's nonsense.

838
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:28,555
Life is short.
You can't put this on hold.

839
01:13:31,224 --> 01:13:32,559
Okay.

840
01:13:32,601 --> 01:13:35,270
I agree. You are right.

841
01:13:35,312 --> 01:13:38,399
Good. So...

842
01:13:38,440 --> 01:13:42,944
we need you looking royal.

843
01:13:42,986 --> 01:13:45,071
Mm-hm.

844
01:13:45,113 --> 01:13:47,658
Well, actually,
I am a Christian,

845
01:13:47,699 --> 01:13:50,911
so, nothing too...

846
01:13:50,952 --> 01:13:54,373
Mm. Honey,

847
01:13:54,415 --> 01:13:56,708
you're out here worried
about another woman's mail

848
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,169
when you're hiding the essence
of your womanhood

849
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,504
from your own husband.

850
01:14:00,546 --> 01:14:03,214
Is that really what
white Jesus wants?

851
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:12,974
Sometimes a king needs his queen

852
01:14:13,016 --> 01:14:16,520
to remind him who she is.

853
01:14:16,562 --> 01:14:18,063
Now, come on.

854
01:14:27,948 --> 01:14:29,950
You look...

855
01:14:31,034 --> 01:14:33,412
very beautiful.

856
01:14:33,454 --> 01:14:35,414
I'm glad you like it.

857
01:14:35,456 --> 01:14:36,790
Can I get you anything else?

858
01:14:36,832 --> 01:14:38,792
Oh, coffee, please.

859
01:14:38,834 --> 01:14:40,919
- Ma'am?
- Oh, no. Thank you.

860
01:14:43,422 --> 01:14:44,798
Thank you for bringing me here.

861
01:14:44,840 --> 01:14:46,717
It's... it's very nice.

862
01:14:59,480 --> 01:15:03,484
Remember when life was simple?

863
01:15:05,402 --> 01:15:09,656
When a fancy night
was sitting on the beach,

864
01:15:09,698 --> 01:15:11,933
grilling fish over a fire...

865
01:15:13,326 --> 01:15:14,953
with cheap wine?

866
01:15:17,372 --> 01:15:20,959
Red snapper with jindungo,
of course.

867
01:15:21,001 --> 01:15:23,629
And plantains.

868
01:15:23,670 --> 01:15:26,423
From Dona Magalie's place
on the corner.

869
01:15:26,465 --> 01:15:29,009
Did she survive?

870
01:15:32,262 --> 01:15:35,557
I'm... not even sure.

871
01:15:35,599 --> 01:15:38,268
After we left for Tanzania,

872
01:15:38,309 --> 01:15:40,979
I lost touch
with so many people.

873
01:16:02,668 --> 01:16:03,710
Let's dance.

874
01:16:05,629 --> 01:16:08,507
- Where?
- Here, on the side.

875
01:16:08,549 --> 01:16:11,176
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

876
01:16:11,217 --> 01:16:12,302
The band's warming up.

877
01:16:12,343 --> 01:16:14,888
Shouldn't we wait for them
to start the party properly?

878
01:16:16,723 --> 01:16:20,060
I'm not stopping. Come.

879
01:16:20,101 --> 01:16:21,562
Join me.

880
01:16:21,603 --> 01:16:24,773
You are embarrassing yourself.

881
01:16:24,815 --> 01:16:26,525
Then come rescue me, huh?

882
01:16:26,567 --> 01:16:29,653
We'll be embarrassed together.

883
01:16:46,169 --> 01:16:48,129
See?

884
01:16:49,427 --> 01:16:50,465
It's working!

885
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:52,676
It's been so long.
I don't even remember how.

886
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,772
You're always the most beautiful...

887
01:17:07,941 --> 01:17:10,276
when you dance.

888
01:18:19,971 --> 01:18:22,891
From the donation box.

889
01:18:30,982 --> 01:18:32,943
Wait, wait, don't do that.

890
01:18:32,984 --> 01:18:34,945
- I'll get rid of them!
- Esther, no.

891
01:18:34,986 --> 01:18:38,198
I've heard you, Walter,
loud and clear.

892
01:18:38,239 --> 01:18:41,201
You don't want me.

893
01:18:41,242 --> 01:18:43,662
You want something else.

894
01:18:46,456 --> 01:18:48,083
This...

895
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:51,712
This was too big for us
to not lose ourselves.

896
01:18:55,548 --> 01:18:58,844
I... I want to go back home.

897
01:19:16,527 --> 01:19:19,698
Everybody thinks
her father abandoned us,

898
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:21,700
that she was born from disgrace,

899
01:19:21,742 --> 01:19:23,534
and that's why
you never came back.

900
01:19:23,576 --> 01:19:25,286
She wasn't born from disgrace!

901
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:27,622
After you left,
my parents disowned me

902
01:19:27,664 --> 01:19:29,833
and took their curses
to their graves!

903
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:11,082
I need to know who she is.

904
01:20:17,130 --> 01:20:19,132
You ready to kill it
at the cypher tonight?

905
01:20:19,174 --> 01:20:22,427
Yeah. Neema made me
a special dance mix.

906
01:20:38,944 --> 01:20:40,570
Write your stage name on here.

907
01:21:07,555 --> 01:21:11,351
When you get out there,
you forget about your parents.

908
01:21:11,392 --> 01:21:14,062
Forget about everything.
You're gonna kill it.

909
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:17,440
Thanks, DJ.

910
01:21:17,482 --> 01:21:19,025
For what?

911
01:21:19,067 --> 01:21:20,318
For believing.

912
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:21,945
You know I got you.

913
01:21:21,987 --> 01:21:23,780
It ain't really nothing.

914
01:21:36,251 --> 01:21:38,336
All, right, well, let's...
Let's get going.

915
01:21:53,101 --> 01:21:55,645
I'm looking for my daughter.

916
01:21:55,686 --> 01:21:57,188
She's a dancer.

917
01:22:06,197 --> 01:22:08,574
Next.

918
01:22:17,792 --> 01:22:19,210
That's Wreckka.

919
01:22:19,252 --> 01:22:21,296
Watch her closely.
She's the one to beat.

920
01:22:33,975 --> 01:22:36,686
All right, all right, all right.
Repping Philly,

921
01:22:36,727 --> 01:22:40,899
we have... Dirty Dozen!

922
01:22:44,986 --> 01:22:49,115
Repping New York,
our reigning champion, Wreckka!

923
01:22:51,534 --> 01:22:52,911
We have a winner.

924
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:58,249
All right, guys,
let's take a five-minute break

925
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:59,792
before we get to this next round.

926
01:23:04,755 --> 01:23:05,995
Just stay focused.

927
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:11,596
I think you got this
competition wrapped up.

928
01:23:13,556 --> 01:23:17,310
The audience is live.
The judges are gonna love it.

929
01:23:17,352 --> 01:23:20,105
You're amazing.
Just focus in and loosen up.

930
01:23:20,146 --> 01:23:22,523
Focus and...

931
01:23:23,461 --> 01:23:24,461
Yes.

932
01:23:25,693 --> 01:23:27,528
Hey, where you going?

933
01:23:27,570 --> 01:23:29,530
- I have to go.
- Wait, what...

934
01:23:29,572 --> 01:23:31,657
- I made a mistake, all right?
- What do you mean?

935
01:23:31,699 --> 01:23:33,243
I have to go.

936
01:23:33,284 --> 01:23:35,245
Sylvia! Hold on.

937
01:23:44,545 --> 01:23:46,756
I have to go find her.

938
01:23:52,262 --> 01:23:53,972
She's all I have.

939
01:23:54,014 --> 01:23:57,058
This is my responsibility, Viñha.

940
01:23:58,851 --> 01:23:59,851
Go.

941
01:24:01,021 --> 01:24:03,439
Fight for your dance, huh?

942
01:24:05,066 --> 01:24:07,068
I'll find her.

943
01:24:53,781 --> 01:24:55,575
Up next, ladies and gentlemen,

944
01:24:55,616 --> 01:24:57,452
our defending champion, Wreckka,

945
01:24:57,493 --> 01:24:58,995
has agreed to a battle
with the new kid on the block,

946
01:24:59,037 --> 01:25:01,664
Young Afrikka!

947
01:25:39,077 --> 01:25:40,911
No.

948
01:25:43,289 --> 01:25:44,332
No.

949
01:28:24,242 --> 01:28:26,327
I've been lost too.

950
01:28:31,291 --> 01:28:34,126
And Linda found you.

951
01:28:36,128 --> 01:28:38,673
She gave me hope, Esther.

952
01:28:38,714 --> 01:28:41,467
She insisted I don't give up,

953
01:28:41,509 --> 01:28:46,222
that I keep petitioning immigration
for us to be together.

954
01:29:01,321 --> 01:29:04,907
- You think it was easy for me?
- Of course not.

955
01:29:05,825 --> 01:29:08,536
We lost so many years.

956
01:29:11,121 --> 01:29:12,873
Look, I'm sorry.

957
01:29:18,045 --> 01:29:22,174
We don't even
know each other anymore,

958
01:29:22,216 --> 01:29:24,302
or ourselves.

959
01:29:27,972 --> 01:29:30,057
When we met...

960
01:29:33,018 --> 01:29:36,021
we didn't know if we'd live
to see the next day.

961
01:29:37,231 --> 01:29:40,485
We didn't know
who was a comrade,

962
01:29:40,526 --> 01:29:42,570
who was an informant,

963
01:29:42,612 --> 01:29:45,155
who was there for the ride.

964
01:29:48,951 --> 01:29:50,578
Words meant nothing.

965
01:29:53,498 --> 01:29:56,376
So, we danced.

966
01:29:57,918 --> 01:30:00,212
When I moved, you followed.

967
01:30:02,382 --> 01:30:05,635
When you hesitate,
I slowed down...

968
01:30:09,138 --> 01:30:11,432
because we could feel
each other.

969
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,402
So...

970
01:30:26,155 --> 01:30:28,699
what do we do now?

971
01:32:21,103 --> 01:32:22,730
Mae?

972
01:32:28,528 --> 01:32:30,613
Pai said you went dancing.

973
01:32:30,655 --> 01:32:32,490
What happened?

974
01:32:34,283 --> 01:32:37,202
The crowd...

975
01:32:37,244 --> 01:32:39,163
they really liked me, Mama.

976
01:32:44,126 --> 01:32:45,628
They saw me.

977
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:47,922
Of course they did.

978
01:32:50,174 --> 01:32:52,927
We see you.

979
01:32:52,968 --> 01:32:54,762
We do.

980
01:33:05,648 --> 01:33:07,733
I'll make us breakfast.

981
01:34:21,431 --> 01:34:23,433
Which one?

982
01:34:23,475 --> 01:34:25,603
This one.

983
01:34:25,645 --> 01:34:28,022
Your favorite biscuits.

984
01:34:39,659 --> 01:34:42,286
I like it.

985
01:34:53,463 --> 01:34:54,882
Do you want?

986
01:34:54,924 --> 01:34:56,425
Mm-hm. Thank you.

987
01:42:16,623 --> 01:42:19,183
Hi, my name is John Akomfrah.

988
01:42:19,223 --> 01:42:22,023
I'm an artist and a film-maker

989
01:42:22,063 --> 01:42:26,783
and I'm here to talk to you today
about Farewell Amor,

990
01:42:26,823 --> 01:42:28,583
which is a film you've just seen.

991
01:42:28,623 --> 01:42:33,503
And I'm very, very lucky
to have next to me Ekwa Msangi,

992
01:42:33,543 --> 01:42:38,143
who's both a director -the director, rather - and an ally.

993
01:42:38,183 --> 01:42:41,183
Am I okay to say "director and ally"?

994
01:42:41,223 --> 01:42:44,663
Yeah, absolutely.
I should certainly hope so!

995
01:42:46,983 --> 01:42:50,543
When we met,
one of the things I was convinced about

996
01:42:50,583 --> 01:42:57,103
was that you wanted to make projects
about the African experience in New York,

997
01:42:57,143 --> 01:42:58,303
where you were at the time.

998
01:42:58,343 --> 01:43:04,143
Yeah, so Farewell Amor is a project
that's been sort of stewing in my mind

999
01:43:04,183 --> 01:43:07,343
for a long time,
because it's a family story.

1000
01:43:07,383 --> 01:43:10,983
It's inspired by an aunt and an uncle

1001
01:43:11,023 --> 01:43:13,983
who were married
in the mid '90s, in Tanzania.

1002
01:43:14,023 --> 01:43:17,383
And my uncle got a student visa
to come to the US

1003
01:43:17,423 --> 01:43:22,223
and had every intention of bringing Auntie
and cousin right behind him.

1004
01:43:22,263 --> 01:43:27,423
And, to date, they've still been stuck
in visa applications, visa rejections,

1005
01:43:27,463 --> 01:43:29,783
visa application, visa rejections
for decades.

1006
01:43:29,823 --> 01:43:34,503
Watching their struggle
for so many years,

1007
01:43:34,543 --> 01:43:36,583
I wanted to make the "what if?" story.

1008
01:43:36,623 --> 01:43:39,823
I had this image in my mind
of my uncle, you know,

1009
01:43:39,863 --> 01:43:43,503
"What if Auntie finally got her visa?
That's no longer the issue.

1010
01:43:43,543 --> 01:43:46,663
"They're coming. They're coming.
It's a done deal.

1011
01:43:46,703 --> 01:43:51,943
"You know, and so Uncle's at the airport,
at arrivals gate,

1012
01:43:51,983 --> 01:43:55,423
"and he's, like, what is he...
what is he thinking?

1013
01:43:55,463 --> 01:43:57,543
"What is he feeling?
Would he recognise them?

1014
01:43:57,583 --> 01:43:59,063
"What is the first thing to say?"

1015
01:43:59,103 --> 01:44:00,983
- Amor!
- You know, for me,

1016
01:44:01,023 --> 01:44:04,823
New York is a place
that has all sorts of people like that,

1017
01:44:04,863 --> 01:44:07,183
not just African immigrants,
you know?

1018
01:44:07,223 --> 01:44:11,103
Everybody is that, and including
a lot of the white immigrants

1019
01:44:11,143 --> 01:44:14,743
that came to New York
through Ellis Island, way back when,

1020
01:44:14,783 --> 01:44:18,383
who left behind everything
in Ireland and Scotland,

1021
01:44:18,423 --> 01:44:22,183
and wherever else they came from,
to start this new place.

1022
01:44:22,223 --> 01:44:24,023
As you may be aware,

1023
01:44:24,063 --> 01:44:28,303
I'm a child
of one of those exiles in the film.

1024
01:44:28,343 --> 01:44:29,983
Yes.

1025
01:44:30,023 --> 01:44:36,103
And it is very much in the context
of your unfolding story

1026
01:44:36,143 --> 01:44:38,863
that I arrived here, you know,

1027
01:44:38,903 --> 01:44:44,503
except that I came with one parent
and one who couldn't join,

1028
01:44:44,543 --> 01:44:47,383
because they died in a coup, basically.

1029
01:44:47,423 --> 01:44:49,543
And I was really struck

1030
01:44:49,583 --> 01:44:55,623
by how different
that story that you have here

1031
01:44:55,663 --> 01:44:59,703
is from the other New York Africa stories.

1032
01:44:59,743 --> 01:45:03,943
I mean, was that a conscious attempt
to try and avoid the other ones, or...?

1033
01:45:03,983 --> 01:45:06,663
Do you know what I mean?
There's a very...

1034
01:45:06,703 --> 01:45:09,943
There's a way in which stories
are made about Africans in New York,

1035
01:45:09,983 --> 01:45:12,143
and this doesn't feel like one of them.

1036
01:45:12,183 --> 01:45:16,983
Most of the films that at least I've seen,
or that tend to be popularised,

1037
01:45:17,023 --> 01:45:21,383
certainly funded
through a Hollywood-type system

1038
01:45:21,423 --> 01:45:25,543
tend to be about either
the most exceptional African ever,

1039
01:45:25,583 --> 01:45:31,023
or the most, sort of, destitute,
struggling African ever.

1040
01:45:31,063 --> 01:45:33,463
Yes, it's a story of immigrants,

1041
01:45:33,503 --> 01:45:35,183
but I wasn't very much interested

1042
01:45:35,223 --> 01:45:39,183
in talking about the political aspects
of their immigration,

1043
01:45:39,223 --> 01:45:41,783
which tends to be
the other type of stories,

1044
01:45:41,823 --> 01:45:45,383
sort of like the cause, the issue-driven.

1045
01:45:45,423 --> 01:45:48,903
You know, what happens
when they got to the border,

1046
01:45:48,943 --> 01:45:53,103
and then the racist cop said...
and the racist immigration laws

1047
01:45:53,143 --> 01:45:56,383
or anti immigration laws
made them do XYZ, you know,

1048
01:45:56,423 --> 01:45:58,943
I mean, that is a story
and it certainly happens,

1049
01:45:58,983 --> 01:46:02,503
and it's very serious,
but I really wanted an opportunity

1050
01:46:02,543 --> 01:46:06,023
to just, like,
depoliticise the immigrant.

1051
01:46:09,943 --> 01:46:13,863
You know, first of all, not giving them
the titles as an immigrant,

1052
01:46:13,903 --> 01:46:17,063
but actually, like, names.
Like, we actually know them as people.

1053
01:46:17,103 --> 01:46:22,383
You know, I mean,
it's harder for people to... relate.

1054
01:46:22,423 --> 01:46:26,023
If it's just about
a very specific political issue,

1055
01:46:26,063 --> 01:46:28,223
that I may never have experienced.

1056
01:46:28,263 --> 01:46:30,703
And it's like, "Oh, what a terrible thing
is happening to them."

1057
01:46:30,743 --> 01:46:34,343
But we've all experienced heartbreak,
you know, we've all experienced longing,

1058
01:46:34,383 --> 01:46:36,943
we've all experienced, you know,

1059
01:46:36,983 --> 01:46:40,383
being new in an environment
that we're unfamiliar with.

1060
01:46:40,423 --> 01:46:42,983
And I feel like the way
to know them as people

1061
01:46:43,023 --> 01:46:46,023
is to know their sort of, like,
their heart problems.

1062
01:46:46,063 --> 01:46:50,823
- Sorry for being late, Mr Uno.
- Okay. Immigration, life quality.

1063
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:55,183
I was involved with a feature
set in New York,

1064
01:46:55,223 --> 01:46:59,623
about a coming-to-America scenario.

1065
01:46:59,663 --> 01:47:04,103
And so I know the importance of casting,

1066
01:47:04,143 --> 01:47:09,823
and I think, in many ways,
partly why mine didn't go

1067
01:47:09,863 --> 01:47:14,063
to the final hurdle was because, like,
we didn't quite get the casting right.

1068
01:47:14,103 --> 01:47:17,743
So, tell me something about your cast,
because it's a fabulous one.

1069
01:47:17,783 --> 01:47:21,063
Yeah, we... Man, we got really lucky.

1070
01:47:21,103 --> 01:47:26,023
I mean, I was very clear...
what I needed them to do.

1071
01:47:27,653 --> 01:47:30,703
I needed people who had danceability,

1072
01:47:30,743 --> 01:47:33,383
for at least for Walter
and Sylvia's characters.

1073
01:47:33,423 --> 01:47:39,823
I needed people who could be
taught an Angolan accent,

1074
01:47:39,863 --> 01:47:43,223
not an "African" accent,
because there is no such thing.

1075
01:47:43,263 --> 01:47:46,183
But specifically an Angolan accent,

1076
01:47:46,223 --> 01:47:47,703
which is a very difficult one.

1077
01:47:47,743 --> 01:47:50,943
Lord, thank you for bringing us together.

1078
01:47:50,983 --> 01:47:53,103
And then I just wanted them

1079
01:47:53,143 --> 01:47:55,103
to actually look
like they could be a family.

1080
01:47:55,143 --> 01:47:59,543
So, we started with Sylvia,
and she came through our casting director,

1081
01:47:59,583 --> 01:48:01,263
and was just, you know...

1082
01:48:01,303 --> 01:48:05,863
There's, there's something about Jayme
that is so striking.

1083
01:48:05,903 --> 01:48:09,663
I mean, she's beautiful, yes,
but just, like, even her intensity

1084
01:48:09,703 --> 01:48:13,303
in her personality is just so striking
from the minute you meet her.

1085
01:48:17,303 --> 01:48:21,303
For the other two, for Walter and Esther,

1086
01:48:21,543 --> 01:48:23,063
I know Ntare,

1087
01:48:23,103 --> 01:48:26,623
because he's also a wonderful
experimental film-maker

1088
01:48:26,663 --> 01:48:29,943
and our short films
have travelled together in some festivals.

1089
01:48:29,983 --> 01:48:33,743
And we've been threatening to work
together for several years.

1090
01:48:33,783 --> 01:48:37,943
And, so, you know, I reached out to him,
because I know he can do it.

1091
01:48:37,983 --> 01:48:41,623
He's an incredible actor,
and I know he can do accents as well.

1092
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:44,663
Let's dance.

1093
01:48:44,703 --> 01:48:46,983
I'm not stopping. Come.

1094
01:48:48,063 --> 01:48:49,503
Join me.

1095
01:48:49,543 --> 01:48:52,463
You are embarrassing yourself!

1096
01:48:52,503 --> 01:48:54,863
Then come rescue me.

1097
01:48:54,903 --> 01:48:57,623
We'll be embarrassed together.

1098
01:48:57,663 --> 01:49:01,103
He did more than anything
I could have even imagined.

1099
01:49:01,143 --> 01:49:05,023
Similar to Zainab. She...
I have never worked with her.

1100
01:49:05,063 --> 01:49:08,663
She's very big in theatre in New York.

1101
01:49:08,703 --> 01:49:11,983
I mean, it wasn't even... It was...

1102
01:49:12,023 --> 01:49:14,663
There wasn't even a question about it.
It was just, like, "Of course."

1103
01:49:15,903 --> 01:49:19,303
- How is Walter?
- Oh, he's...

1104
01:49:21,863 --> 01:49:26,343
He's working very hard.
His life here is so difficult.

1105
01:49:26,383 --> 01:49:28,063
I don't believe we've met.

1106
01:49:29,183 --> 01:49:31,583
So, I, we really, really lucked out.

1107
01:49:31,623 --> 01:49:34,623
There's literally isn't
a single person in our cast

1108
01:49:34,663 --> 01:49:38,983
who was sort of like a fly-by-night,
just, like, you know, last-minute call.

1109
01:49:39,023 --> 01:49:40,623
Everybody was very deliberate.

1110
01:49:40,663 --> 01:49:43,703
And they did such amazing work.
I'm really grateful.

1111
01:49:43,743 --> 01:49:46,463
The score is, again,

1112
01:49:46,503 --> 01:49:49,863
- unusually, very un-African-movie.
- Uh-huh.

1113
01:49:51,383 --> 01:49:53,543
So, I want you to talk a bit about that.

1114
01:49:53,583 --> 01:49:57,143
My reason for wanting
these characters to be from Angola,

1115
01:49:57,183 --> 01:50:01,103
as opposed to East Africa,
which is where I'm from,

1116
01:50:01,143 --> 01:50:03,423
is specifically because of the music

1117
01:50:03,463 --> 01:50:06,703
and the dance that goes with the music,
which I love,

1118
01:50:06,743 --> 01:50:09,703
and I'm a practitioner of Kizomba,

1119
01:50:09,743 --> 01:50:11,823
which is the style that Walter practises.

1120
01:50:15,263 --> 01:50:19,583
Kizomba is a very beautiful,
sensual couples dance from Angola,

1121
01:50:19,623 --> 01:50:22,463
which... ah... you know, most people

1122
01:50:22,503 --> 01:50:27,863
don't think beautiful, sensual
couples dance is from Africa, period.

1123
01:50:27,903 --> 01:50:30,783
You know, most African dance
is characterised by drumming

1124
01:50:30,823 --> 01:50:33,063
and the fertility dance,
or the rain dance,

1125
01:50:33,103 --> 01:50:36,623
or, you know, something like that,
which is great, we have those too.

1126
01:50:36,663 --> 01:50:38,583
But we also have these.

1127
01:50:41,103 --> 01:50:45,583
The thing about Kizomba,
which makes it very unique for me,

1128
01:50:45,623 --> 01:50:52,263
is that there is not
a regular foot pattern to the dance.

1129
01:50:52,303 --> 01:50:56,783
The leader is dancing to the music
and to how they feel about the music,

1130
01:50:56,823 --> 01:51:01,383
and your job, as the follower,
is to be connected to them

1131
01:51:01,423 --> 01:51:03,343
so that you can follow,

1132
01:51:03,383 --> 01:51:05,743
because they can change at any moment.

1133
01:51:05,783 --> 01:51:08,063
And, so, there is a level of connection
that's required.

1134
01:51:08,103 --> 01:51:10,543
It's a very close...
It looks like a really...

1135
01:51:10,583 --> 01:51:13,463
A lot of people get very intimidated
because it looks super sexy.

1136
01:51:13,503 --> 01:51:17,463
And it is but you actually have
to concentrate quite a bit,

1137
01:51:17,503 --> 01:51:20,423
because you really do need to, like,

1138
01:51:20,463 --> 01:51:25,543
have some sort of connection
with your partner in order to perform.

1139
01:51:25,583 --> 01:51:28,343
And I just thought
it was a really interesting metaphor

1140
01:51:28,383 --> 01:51:30,863
for a relationship of these two people

1141
01:51:30,903 --> 01:51:34,263
who were in sync,
literally, were in step,

1142
01:51:34,303 --> 01:51:37,303
and, because of distance,
because of time have fallen out of step

1143
01:51:37,343 --> 01:51:40,103
and are therefore
not able to dance together.

1144
01:51:48,623 --> 01:51:51,663
Kuduro, which is the style
that Sylvia practises,

1145
01:51:51,703 --> 01:51:53,743
is also out of Angola.

1146
01:51:53,783 --> 01:51:56,783
It's kind of harsh and from the streets
and from the youth and,

1147
01:51:56,823 --> 01:52:00,223
you know, young people,
it's their way of expressing the things

1148
01:52:00,263 --> 01:52:02,263
that they can't say to their elders.

1149
01:52:02,303 --> 01:52:05,183
You know, their frustrations
with the economic situation

1150
01:52:05,223 --> 01:52:08,383
or, you know,
coming out of a 30-year civil war

1151
01:52:08,423 --> 01:52:12,183
and what that's done to the country
and to people and domestic violence

1152
01:52:12,223 --> 01:52:14,303
and all these different topics
that people,

1153
01:52:14,343 --> 01:52:18,863
you know, have feelings about it,
but don't have a place to express it,

1154
01:52:18,903 --> 01:52:21,143
other than through their dance
and their music.

1155
01:52:21,183 --> 01:52:24,143
Watch her closely. She's the one to beat.

1156
01:52:24,183 --> 01:52:28,383
For Sylvia, as a young African girl,

1157
01:52:28,423 --> 01:52:32,903
who is not raised
to speak back to her parents

1158
01:52:32,943 --> 01:52:35,503
and tell them off - you know,
that would never happen -

1159
01:52:35,543 --> 01:52:38,623
this would be the only way
that she would be able to express herself.

1160
01:52:38,663 --> 01:52:41,623
I loved one other quality about the music,

1161
01:52:41,663 --> 01:52:47,863
as Walter says at one point, you know,
it's the vehicle of freedom.

1162
01:52:47,903 --> 01:52:48,903
Mm-hm, yeah.

1163
01:52:48,943 --> 01:52:51,783
Dancing to music,
you set yourself free.

1164
01:52:51,823 --> 01:52:55,103
But it's also the way in which...

1165
01:52:55,143 --> 01:52:59,905
a very Portuguese affect
comes into the film, really,

1166
01:52:59,942 --> 01:53:03,503
because all the music
carries this saudade.

1167
01:53:03,543 --> 01:53:04,543
- You know?
- Yeah.

1168
01:53:04,583 --> 01:53:07,583
This kind of... not melancholy,

1169
01:53:07,623 --> 01:53:09,463
but a sadness.

1170
01:53:09,503 --> 01:53:10,863
The longing.

1171
01:53:10,903 --> 01:53:12,943
About longing, you know,

1172
01:53:12,983 --> 01:53:16,703
and nostalgia for things
which cannot and have not been.

1173
01:53:16,743 --> 01:53:18,423
Yeah. Exactly.

1174
01:53:18,463 --> 01:53:22,943
It made it a very unique "African" film,

1175
01:53:22,983 --> 01:53:27,983
in a way, because it had
this pan-continental feel,

1176
01:53:28,023 --> 01:53:31,303
you know, it could easily
have been made in Brazil.

1177
01:53:40,183 --> 01:53:43,423
I was born in the US,
my parents were students at the time.

1178
01:53:43,463 --> 01:53:46,583
So, this was the way
that parents, you know,

1179
01:53:46,623 --> 01:53:48,743
told their children
about where we're from.

1180
01:53:48,783 --> 01:53:52,423
And, in my research about,
you know, Angolans in exile,

1181
01:53:52,463 --> 01:53:55,383
that was one of the things
that came up was just, like,

1182
01:53:55,423 --> 01:53:59,103
the connection, how music,
Kizomba and Samba music in particular,

1183
01:53:59,143 --> 01:54:03,223
were so important in terms
of the remembering of home,

1184
01:54:03,263 --> 01:54:06,743
but also the transferring
of information to the youth

1185
01:54:06,783 --> 01:54:08,503
about what we'd left behind,

1186
01:54:08,543 --> 01:54:10,383
because many of them
had never seen Angola.

1187
01:54:19,263 --> 01:54:21,263
- Pay attention.
- Sorry.

1188
01:54:24,863 --> 01:54:26,983
Tell me what you want to do with it now

1189
01:54:27,023 --> 01:54:31,263
and where is it going,
now that it's had its big Sundance...

1190
01:54:31,303 --> 01:54:33,143
Or maybe we can talk about Sundance.

1191
01:54:33,183 --> 01:54:35,823
Yeah, Sundance was amazing.

1192
01:54:35,863 --> 01:54:39,063
We're so grateful that we were...
we had the experience

1193
01:54:39,103 --> 01:54:43,103
of being able to show this film
to a live audience,

1194
01:54:43,143 --> 01:54:45,543
because, you know,
the world is so different now.

1195
01:54:45,583 --> 01:54:50,623
My film career,
making stories about African people,

1196
01:54:50,663 --> 01:54:53,903
in a way that's not your typical,
you know,

1197
01:54:53,943 --> 01:54:57,183
African story
that Hollywood tends to put out,

1198
01:54:57,223 --> 01:55:01,463
or is normally seen on American screens
and that kind of thing,

1199
01:55:01,503 --> 01:55:04,343
I've had a lot of no's and a lot of,
like, question marks

1200
01:55:04,383 --> 01:55:06,983
and like, "What are you doing?"
and, "Who are these people?"

1201
01:55:07,023 --> 01:55:09,583
and, "We don't quite understand,"
and, "Are you sure you want...?"

1202
01:55:09,623 --> 01:55:11,663
"Shouldn't they have
some more colourful clothes on?"

1203
01:55:11,710 --> 01:55:14,550
and, "I don't quite understand
what they're saying."

1204
01:55:14,583 --> 01:55:16,223
All of those kinds of things.

1205
01:55:18,783 --> 01:55:20,263
"Too many subtitles!"

1206
01:55:20,303 --> 01:55:22,903
"Not enough subtitles!" et cetera.

1207
01:55:22,940 --> 01:55:24,156
And, so...

1208
01:55:24,183 --> 01:55:26,343
"Why are they speaking English?"

1209
01:55:26,368 --> 01:55:28,198
Right!

1210
01:55:28,223 --> 01:55:29,943
Or, "They should all speak English."

1211
01:55:29,983 --> 01:55:32,343
Exactly. Exactly. And, so,

1212
01:55:32,383 --> 01:55:38,703
I had kind of developed
a little bit of a skin you know, around...

1213
01:55:38,743 --> 01:55:41,263
"I don't think anyone's gonna get this,
I'm gonna make it anyways.

1214
01:55:41,303 --> 01:55:43,143
"But I'm not making it for you,

1215
01:55:43,183 --> 01:55:45,663
"'cause I just don't think...
My experience has been

1216
01:55:45,703 --> 01:55:49,943
"that most American people
don't get the work that I make."

1217
01:55:49,983 --> 01:55:52,743
And, so, to be able to show it,

1218
01:55:52,783 --> 01:55:55,383
to get into Sundance,
for one, in competition,

1219
01:55:55,423 --> 01:55:58,903
and be able to show it
to all of these audiences

1220
01:55:58,943 --> 01:56:03,303
who were just completely floored
and the tears and the gushing...

1221
01:56:03,343 --> 01:56:05,503
It was just, like, "Wow!

1222
01:56:05,543 --> 01:56:07,583
"This is not what I expected at all."

1223
01:56:07,623 --> 01:56:10,663
It was a really wonderful
and beautiful experience.

1224
01:56:12,943 --> 01:56:16,103
♪ Everywhere I go

1225
01:56:16,143 --> 01:56:19,743
♪ I'm gonna let it shine

1226
01:56:19,783 --> 01:56:22,863
♪ Everywhere I go... ♪

1227
01:56:22,903 --> 01:56:24,383
And from here, you know,

1228
01:56:24,423 --> 01:56:27,543
where we're releasing
in the US, December 11th,

1229
01:56:27,583 --> 01:56:29,983
we're releasing on MUBI, December 18,

1230
01:56:30,023 --> 01:56:34,143
really excited to be able
to share this work.

1231
01:56:34,183 --> 01:56:36,063
I mean, feeling very encouraged

1232
01:56:36,103 --> 01:56:39,223
by the feedback
that we've gotten thus far.

1233
01:56:39,263 --> 01:56:42,183
It's been really interesting
to see the different reactions.

1234
01:56:42,223 --> 01:56:46,343
You know, there's Team Walter,
Team Esther and Team Sylvia.

1235
01:56:46,383 --> 01:56:48,863
Team Linda is also...

1236
01:56:48,903 --> 01:56:50,623
Really?

1237
01:56:50,663 --> 01:56:53,623
There have been a few Team Lindas, yeah!

1238
01:56:55,903 --> 01:56:59,103
"What happened to Linda?
Justice for Linda!"

1239
01:56:59,143 --> 01:57:00,943
Well, look, whatever happens,

1240
01:57:00,983 --> 01:57:04,063
whichever team
people are going to root for,

1241
01:57:04,103 --> 01:57:07,823
I just hope they see it,
'cause it is a fantastic film.

1242
01:57:07,863 --> 01:57:10,143
Thank you so much. Thank you.

1243
01:57:10,183 --> 01:57:13,223
I'm so proud of you.
I can't tell you how proud I am.

1244
01:57:13,263 --> 01:57:15,703
You know, when I found out
you got in the London Film Festival,

1245
01:57:15,743 --> 01:57:18,823
I was, like, "Yay!"

1246
01:57:18,863 --> 01:57:21,863
Thank you, thank you
for your guidance over the years.

1247
01:57:21,903 --> 01:57:24,983
It definitely has helped to bring me here.

1248
01:57:25,023 --> 01:57:28,663
You and the community at large,
because, you know,

1249
01:57:28,703 --> 01:57:30,703
- I stand on many shoulders...
- Hear, hear.

1250
01:57:30,743 --> 01:57:33,263
...in terms of being able
to put this work forward

1251
01:57:33,303 --> 01:57:35,503
and hopefully continuing
to do so in the future.
