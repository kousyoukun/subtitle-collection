1
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:46,138
Jeff Kennedy
International Airport.

2
00:00:46,172 --> 00:00:48,873
You should not accept
any transportation

3
00:00:48,907 --> 00:00:51,876
from anyone without
prior arrangement.

4
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:52,071
- Amorr, here you are.
- My wife.

5
00:01:53,805 --> 00:01:54,572
Sylvia.

6
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:58,910
Look at this, look at this.

7
00:02:02,547 --> 00:02:05,583
Turn around, let me see you.

8
00:02:23,502 --> 00:02:26,738
Wow, Silvia

9
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,573
What do you think of New York?

10
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,874
It's amazing.

11
00:02:29,908 --> 00:02:32,111
We would love to practice
speak English more.

12
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:52,565
Are you okay?

13
00:02:52,597 --> 00:02:55,600
Sylvia, aren't you excited?

14
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,406
This is home, welcome.

15
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,974
I need to use the bathroom.

16
00:03:02,007 --> 00:03:03,109
Yes.

17
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:04,410
Let me show you.

18
00:03:04,443 --> 00:03:07,413
Esther, you and I will
be sleeping down there.

19
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:08,981
She does over there.

20
00:03:09,014 --> 00:03:12,817
And Sylvia, I have converted
the living room for now.

21
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,621
So you could have
your own space.

22
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,023
I'm looking for a bigger place

23
00:03:18,057 --> 00:03:19,558
that would be more suitable.

24
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:23,295
Maybe it would be like all

25
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:26,132
the American kids and
get your own place.

26
00:03:26,165 --> 00:03:28,534
And not yet.

27
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:32,605
First relieve us, the
family as God intended it.

28
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:34,006
Yes, of course.

29
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,043
The bathroom is down there.

30
00:03:38,077 --> 00:03:40,079
The lights is on the
walls to your left.

31
00:03:58,097 --> 00:04:00,633
I wish your mother
could see this.

32
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:03,035
Her boy learned how to cook.

33
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:04,203
I hope you like it.

34
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,105
Who taught you?

35
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,076
I picked up some
things here and there.

36
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:15,047
Please eat before it gets cold.

37
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,183
Let's pray first.

38
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:19,418
We have a lot to
be thankful for.

39
00:04:19,451 --> 00:04:20,919
Yes. Sorry.

40
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:29,962
Jehovah Jirey, we praise
your name the most high.

41
00:04:31,197 --> 00:04:34,366
Lord, thank you for
bringing us together,

42
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,734
after 17 years apart.

43
00:04:36,768 --> 00:04:40,905
We thank you for your
endless blessings and love.

44
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,543
We thank you for our
home and our family.

45
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:49,582
We thank you because the
devil is shamed and defeated.

46
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:54,653
We pray all these things
in the Holy name of Jesus.

47
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:56,422
Amen.

48
00:04:56,455 --> 00:04:57,889
- Amen.
- Amen.

49
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,498
Yes.

50
00:05:20,613 --> 00:05:22,281
It's very soft.

51
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:24,116
Tender.

52
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,489
Americans don't like
stew with their food.

53
00:05:30,522 --> 00:05:32,790
The doctor had
recommended no fat meals.

54
00:05:37,162 --> 00:05:42,167
For years the only food I could
eat was my mother's cookie.

55
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:45,404
So when we got married,

56
00:05:45,437 --> 00:05:48,307
I forced your poor mama
to learn how to cook

57
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,809
all of my mama's dishes.

58
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,182
Poor mama.

59
00:05:59,851 --> 00:06:01,654
She should have
never put up with me.

60
00:06:35,387 --> 00:06:40,392
My pastor said we must focus
on familiarizing ourselves

61
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,697
in spirit and flesh in
order to rebuild our family.

62
00:06:50,169 --> 00:06:51,303
Wait.

63
00:06:51,337 --> 00:06:52,671
What now, unattractive?

64
00:06:52,705 --> 00:06:55,207
No, you're not.

65
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,608
Lying is a sin you know.

66
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,778
That's not what I meant.

67
00:07:08,187 --> 00:07:10,222
I haven't been with
any man since you left.

68
00:07:14,426 --> 00:07:19,198
Thank you, I mean, I'm
sorry I wasn't there.

69
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,582
I hope everything
will be perfect.

70
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:18,257
Seriously.

71
00:08:34,006 --> 00:08:37,443
Perhaps we should just
get some rest, thanks.

72
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,701
Ready for American school?

73
00:09:02,734 --> 00:09:04,803
Of course she is.

74
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:06,038
She's going to study hard

75
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:07,806
so she could get
into medical school.

76
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:12,311
With scholarship, the
first doctor in the family,

77
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:13,378
God willingly.

78
00:09:17,749 --> 00:09:19,818
What kind of medicine
are you interested in?

79
00:09:19,852 --> 00:09:21,687
She wants the three children.

80
00:09:22,888 --> 00:09:24,323
I like mathematics.

81
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,458
Really, like father this one.

82
00:09:26,492 --> 00:09:28,060
I keep telling you

83
00:09:28,093 --> 00:09:30,329
your father was always
studying so many things.

84
00:09:43,575 --> 00:09:44,843
I need to see your back.

85
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,247
Sorry sir, excuse me.

86
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,748
Please step back sir I just
need to check her back.

87
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:52,451
I have this
letter from school.

88
00:10:07,132 --> 00:10:10,736
Did you
find any change in the city?

89
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:13,872
I see you changed that picture.

90
00:10:13,906 --> 00:10:14,907
Yeah.

91
00:10:14,941 --> 00:10:15,942
They said a thing?

92
00:10:16,808 --> 00:10:17,609
Someone.

93
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,746
I know that sex must
be good.

94
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:23,348
Whenever I go back home

95
00:10:23,382 --> 00:10:25,384
my wife is like she
has something to prove.

96
00:10:26,618 --> 00:10:29,421
I can only imagine
after what is it?

97
00:10:29,454 --> 00:10:30,255
Nine years?

98
00:10:30,289 --> 00:10:31,189
17.

99
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,091
She's supposed to be lucky

100
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,128
that he was with the nurse as
you'd be in jail for homicide.

101
00:10:38,564 --> 00:10:42,367
What, you know it's
the truth, man.

102
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:43,735
I don't wanna talk about it.

103
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:47,239
My brother, all I'm
saying to you man.

104
00:10:48,473 --> 00:10:49,474
you're not the only
person who have ever been

105
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,442
in this situation.

106
00:10:51,577 --> 00:10:53,412
Things happen, don't feel bad.

107
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:56,015
I don't, everything is fine.

108
00:10:58,584 --> 00:11:00,819
Well, I guess I
better start my shift.

109
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,590
Have a good one.

110
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:05,424
You too.

111
00:13:52,324 --> 00:13:53,792
Why are you here?

112
00:13:56,328 --> 00:13:57,496
What happened?

113
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,769
I can't be seeing you more time.

114
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:04,937
I need love too.

115
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:09,608
Yes, and thanks.

116
00:15:17,276 --> 00:15:20,213
Hey, what's
up, DJ pull up.

117
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:26,885
I can't.

118
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:46,138
Are you sure you can't?

119
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:23,909
You're early today.

120
00:16:23,943 --> 00:16:24,743
I am.

121
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,712
I swapped my shift

122
00:16:27,746 --> 00:16:29,748
so I could be home for
dinner with the family

123
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,917
at least once this week.

124
00:16:32,851 --> 00:16:33,652
Great

125
00:16:35,154 --> 00:16:38,657
So Vinner, clear your
books, go set the table.

126
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:44,462
So, how was school today?

127
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:45,298
Fine.

128
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:48,000
Is that how you respond?

129
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:53,638
It was fine, thank you.

130
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:08,955
She's so excited to
finally be here with you.

131
00:17:08,988 --> 00:17:10,990
I'm not so sure about that.

132
00:17:11,023 --> 00:17:12,992
Nonsense, cautious.

133
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,468
I was thinking maybe we
should plan some things

134
00:17:23,501 --> 00:17:27,539
as a family so we could
get to know each other.

135
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:29,108
I've just been
praying about this.

136
00:17:29,141 --> 00:17:30,076
- Yes.
- Yes.

137
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:33,511
Or perhaps this Sunday,
we could go for a drive

138
00:17:33,545 --> 00:17:36,215
outside the city,
maybe the jazzy show...

139
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:38,217
Aren't we all going to church?

140
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:39,784
I thought it would
be good to leave

141
00:17:39,818 --> 00:17:42,821
the city early to
avoid the traffic.

142
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:44,357
That's fine.

143
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:46,058
That's fine, perhaps
there's a sunrise service

144
00:17:46,092 --> 00:17:47,892
we can attend.

145
00:17:47,927 --> 00:17:50,930
Of course I'll check.

146
00:17:57,937 --> 00:18:02,208
I brought home some
wine, so we can toast.

147
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:03,042
Alcohol?

148
00:18:04,843 --> 00:18:05,610
It's wine.

149
00:18:08,114 --> 00:18:10,316
But you know we're
shouldn't drink.

150
00:18:10,349 --> 00:18:13,219
But is just a simple wine

151
00:18:14,954 --> 00:18:18,057
for a special occasion.

159
00:21:30,715 --> 00:21:33,552
As soon as my immigration
paperwork is finalized,

160
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:38,224
I'll get a job, so I
can help with the bills.

161
00:21:40,593 --> 00:21:42,261
I can handle things for now.

162
00:21:43,996 --> 00:21:46,265
You got a lot on your
plate to worry about.

163
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:56,275
Thank you a lot.

164
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,111
For what?

165
00:22:01,113 --> 00:22:04,083
Not giving up on us.

166
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:21,166
Don't steal a plate.

167
00:22:25,437 --> 00:22:29,041
And, did you see the mail
that your neighbor brought

168
00:22:30,175 --> 00:22:30,976
the other day?

169
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,912
I don't know why it's
hard for the mail man

170
00:22:34,947 --> 00:22:36,649
to put the mail in
the correct box.

171
00:23:14,886 --> 00:23:15,688
Sylvia,

172
00:23:17,222 --> 00:23:18,923
Sylvia, are you okay?

173
00:23:46,352 --> 00:23:47,653
I'm fine.

174
00:23:47,686 --> 00:23:50,389
And why can't you move it?

175
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,856
I can, I promise.

176
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:53,925
I can't let you go
to school like this.

177
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:56,829
Broken up bone.

178
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:58,063
I'm serious Sylvia.

179
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,232
You're going to tell mama?

180
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:04,103
Come on worry
about mama later.

181
00:24:04,136 --> 00:24:06,238
She's still
down in dialysis.

182
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:11,810
So you're practicing
for the dance there.

183
00:24:13,112 --> 00:24:14,879
Young man told us
about your school.

184
00:24:26,392 --> 00:24:30,129
When you stopped waiting
for my weekend phone calls,

185
00:24:35,234 --> 00:24:38,903
mama said because
sneaking out to dance,

186
00:24:42,508 --> 00:24:43,475
that scared her.

187
00:24:46,812 --> 00:24:48,480
Do you think it scares her?

188
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,284
She prays so much.

189
00:25:03,328 --> 00:25:05,931
You know I used to be
quite a dancer as well

190
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:07,032
when I was younger.

191
00:25:12,037 --> 00:25:12,971
It's true.

192
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,041
It may be not that style dance.

193
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:23,549
Your mother would make matching
outfits with both of us

194
00:25:25,217 --> 00:25:30,122
and we'd go to the secret
parties and dance all night long.

195
00:25:32,691 --> 00:25:33,592
Night?

196
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:34,393
Yeah.

197
00:25:37,963 --> 00:25:41,166
No, we used to dance a
lot before you were born.

198
00:25:43,368 --> 00:25:44,403
And even after,

199
00:25:46,638 --> 00:25:48,340
but you were too
young to remember.

200
00:25:50,309 --> 00:25:51,376
And then what happened?

201
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:58,584
The end of the war.

202
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,324
Aging
doctor pace bill to 3B.

203
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:08,427
Doctor pace bill to 3B

204
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:31,917
Sylvia Disantos.

205
00:26:39,858 --> 00:26:41,326
Wake up, let's go.

206
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,861
Sylvia, let's go.

207
00:26:45,464 --> 00:26:46,231
Come.

208
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,769
What brings you in today?

209
00:26:50,802 --> 00:26:52,871
She injured her hand.

210
00:26:57,276 --> 00:26:59,611
How did this
injury take place?

211
00:26:59,645 --> 00:27:00,412
I fell.

212
00:27:03,315 --> 00:27:04,917
And when did
the injury happen?

213
00:27:07,753 --> 00:27:08,554
Yesterday.

214
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:14,359
Where does it hurt?

215
00:27:14,393 --> 00:27:15,394
Can you show me exactly?

216
00:27:17,596 --> 00:27:18,597
Anywhere else?

217
00:27:20,432 --> 00:27:23,101
It's only a little bruise,
but nothing too unusual.

218
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,810
The doctor is going
to be right with you.

219
00:27:31,843 --> 00:27:32,911
Do you need anything?

220
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,292
- Hi doc.
- What do you want from me?

221
00:27:47,326 --> 00:27:49,561
You promised you would
never rubbed me my face.

222
00:27:49,595 --> 00:27:51,998
She needed a hand Linda.

223
00:27:52,031 --> 00:27:52,898
I trust you.

224
00:27:52,932 --> 00:27:53,933
What do you think?

225
00:27:57,836 --> 00:27:59,771
What do you think this is?

226
00:27:59,805 --> 00:28:01,440
I know this is far from ideal,

227
00:28:01,473 --> 00:28:05,377
but why can't we remain
friends like in the beginning?

228
00:28:06,878 --> 00:28:08,380
This is not the beginning.

229
00:28:10,549 --> 00:28:12,317
We're far from the
beginning Walter.

230
00:28:14,119 --> 00:28:15,387
This is the end.

231
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,324
I'm serious.

232
00:28:22,728 --> 00:28:23,629
Go get the doctor.

233
00:28:25,497 --> 00:28:26,298
Linda.

234
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:42,681
Papa,

235
00:28:45,751 --> 00:28:46,585
do you love us?

236
00:28:48,587 --> 00:28:49,388
Yes.

237
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:53,892
Do you love to make
a life for us, right?

238
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,861
Of course.

239
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:19,311
Sylvia, I was just
taking out the trash.

240
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:28,020
Do you need anything?

241
00:30:34,693 --> 00:30:35,694
There's not.

242
00:30:48,207 --> 00:30:49,307
Sylvia.

243
00:30:49,341 --> 00:30:51,476
Wow. Look a this!

244
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,278
Big girl.

245
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,648
Let me see, let me see.

246
00:30:58,784 --> 00:30:59,518
What!

247
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,287
She's grown.

248
00:31:09,528 --> 00:31:12,731
I need
to use the bathroom.

249
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:58,643
Hey girl, you would
probably be seducing

250
00:31:58,677 --> 00:32:01,646
some hot New York dude
by the time you get this,

251
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,549
I told Rajab to just
forget about you.

252
00:32:04,583 --> 00:32:06,384
I mean please.

253
00:32:10,622 --> 00:32:12,924
She's off to greener pastures.

254
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,094
New York.

255
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:17,997
He's so depressed, imagine
that I've missed you.

256
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:22,367
I'm going to keep making
those remixes for my girl.

257
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,904
So when you become the most
famous dancer in America,

258
00:32:25,938 --> 00:32:29,141
the rest of us can at
least in your enterlarge.

259
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:33,045
Good morning mum.

260
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:44,789
I thought we
talked about those.

261
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:49,761
I don't know why you insist

262
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:53,865
on wearing those ugly
boots all the time.

263
00:32:53,899 --> 00:32:54,633
You're so pretty.

264
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:03,376
All the children at your school

265
00:33:03,408 --> 00:33:06,878
will think Africans are turkey.

266
00:33:06,912 --> 00:33:09,115
These are my
comfortable shoes ma'am.

267
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:10,815
You want me to be uncomfortable?

268
00:33:10,849 --> 00:33:12,051
As soon as I get a job
we'll go to the shopping

269
00:33:12,084 --> 00:33:13,652
to get some proper clothes.

270
00:33:14,853 --> 00:33:18,291
We won't bother your father
about that right now.

271
00:33:22,328 --> 00:33:23,628
Good morning.

272
00:33:26,299 --> 00:33:27,099
Morning.

273
00:34:08,407 --> 00:34:10,376
Here, were having a dance.

274
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:12,311
I don't know if you
want to participate

275
00:34:12,345 --> 00:34:13,845
if you dance or anything.

276
00:34:13,878 --> 00:34:15,247
You guys can go in.

277
00:34:22,388 --> 00:34:23,389
Thank you.

278
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,960
I'm here to enroll my daughter.

279
00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:29,494
Yes, do you speak English?

280
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:33,631
Yes, but she's just adjusting
into the American accent.

281
00:34:33,665 --> 00:34:35,201
Okay.

282
00:34:35,234 --> 00:34:40,239
And I see we're still missing
an official birth certificate.

283
00:34:41,173 --> 00:34:42,841
We have this.

284
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:45,378
This is a letter.

285
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:47,980
Yes, I explained
when I telephoned

286
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:51,083
that Sylvia was born during
the civil war in our country.

287
00:34:52,584 --> 00:34:54,487
And both the hospital
and department of records

288
00:34:54,519 --> 00:34:55,988
were destroyed,

289
00:34:56,022 --> 00:34:59,058
so we don't have any
original birth papers.

290
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,096
Okay.

291
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,265
I'll have Ms. Tami enroll
you and take you to class.

292
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,435
So she just start right now?

293
00:35:09,468 --> 00:35:12,238
Yes, you can pick her
up at 3:30 after school.

294
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,408
Hi, it's me.

295
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:50,976
Hey, wait, where
are you going?

296
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:53,279
Where'd you just
waiting for your bus?

297
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,481
Yo, chill out, calm down.

298
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:58,250
Yo, yo yo.

299
00:35:59,584 --> 00:36:00,519
Chill out, will you?

300
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,422
Will you start over?

301
00:36:05,024 --> 00:36:06,891
Hi, I'm Devin.

302
00:36:06,925 --> 00:36:08,160
But most people call me DJ.

303
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:12,764
Hi, I'm Silvia,

304
00:36:14,033 --> 00:36:15,201
most people call me Silvia.

305
00:36:16,102 --> 00:36:17,136
Hi Silvia,

306
00:36:20,106 --> 00:36:20,872
from Angola?

307
00:36:23,641 --> 00:36:25,211
Someone meeting
in the States or?

308
00:36:27,046 --> 00:36:28,347
Yes.

309
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:32,218
No, my father was here
before, he is a diplomat.

310
00:36:35,488 --> 00:36:37,056
Wow, okay. Cool.

311
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,093
You dance?

312
00:36:41,127 --> 00:36:43,295
Why do you accuse me of these?

313
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:46,165
Just most of the girls on
the step team wear those.

314
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:50,336
Well I do know for a
fact that step team

315
00:36:50,369 --> 00:36:51,504
needs another
separate for the dance

316
00:36:51,537 --> 00:36:52,972
if you're interested.

317
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,875
What is this price?

318
00:36:56,908 --> 00:36:59,411
It's $2000 for best
soul and best team.

319
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:03,282
No.

320
00:37:03,315 --> 00:37:04,550
Why not?

321
00:37:04,583 --> 00:37:06,018
I don't know the steps.

322
00:37:06,051 --> 00:37:08,187
That's easy, you just
look up videos on YouTube,

323
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,654
use the videos to practice.

324
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:12,191
You just have to
know how to dance.

325
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:18,730
Then, if I agree
to look at the steps,

326
00:37:20,232 --> 00:37:21,167
you'll let me pass?

327
00:37:26,405 --> 00:37:27,906
I'll see you later Sylvia.

328
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,515
We should go to the
market this weekend

329
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:11,816
and get some bananas.

330
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:21,193
And something without
cholesterol for your father.

331
00:38:21,227 --> 00:38:23,629
Have you seen the
way he eats fish?

332
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:32,638
Is that Neema?

333
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,474
Did she married?

334
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:37,943
Not yet.

335
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:40,212
One day you meet a nice boy.

336
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:43,148
Hey, maybe in university,
that's how I met your father.

337
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,251
Yes.

338
00:38:47,519 --> 00:38:49,388
He was studying journalism.

339
00:38:49,421 --> 00:38:51,056
You were studying
social sciences

340
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,791
and you both suspect that
each other being communists.

341
00:38:55,461 --> 00:38:57,963
He got on my nerves so much.

342
00:38:57,997 --> 00:39:00,532
Always talking about
politics the whole nights.

343
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:05,837
I told you this
story too many times.

344
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:10,476
He's good a man Vinnia, loyal.

345
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:13,145
Yes Ma'am.

346
00:39:20,519 --> 00:39:24,456
It's not his fault that we
had to wait so many years.

347
00:39:26,025 --> 00:39:28,160
You know, we tried everything.

348
00:39:28,193 --> 00:39:29,962
Why didn't he
come back home then?

349
00:39:32,364 --> 00:39:35,134
Because we wanted
you to have the life

350
00:39:35,167 --> 00:39:36,801
that we couldn't have.

351
00:39:44,543 --> 00:39:46,378
I don't want to
suffer anymore.

352
00:39:50,683 --> 00:39:53,352
God, those days
are behind us now.

353
00:39:56,255 --> 00:39:58,657
Everything is going
to be fine I promise.

354
00:40:00,059 --> 00:40:00,892
God is good.

355
00:40:10,069 --> 00:40:13,305
Today's topic,
immigration and emigration.

356
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:14,573
You have two different lists.

357
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:16,775
I want you all to
turn to page 25.

358
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:22,348
I'm gonna go down look at
the two different lists.

359
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:23,749
Mr. Jamison, you're late.

360
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,418
Sorry for being
late Mr. Tunaw.

361
00:40:26,452 --> 00:40:30,522
Immigration, life
equality, religious freedom.

362
00:40:30,556 --> 00:40:31,824
Take out a piece of paper

363
00:40:31,856 --> 00:40:34,393
and I want you to
start writing down.

364
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,596
Hi DJ, what's
your African grow from?

365
00:40:39,198 --> 00:40:41,033
All
right, settle down.

366
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,434
Everybody's settled out.

367
00:40:42,468 --> 00:40:44,370
Everybody turn to page 25.

368
00:40:44,403 --> 00:40:45,938
Okay. Yes.

369
00:40:45,971 --> 00:40:47,706
Mr. Jamison, please
turn the pages.

370
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,742
Okay, here we go.
Immigration first list.

371
00:41:23,642 --> 00:41:25,978
Sylvia.

372
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:26,812
Sylvia.

373
00:41:30,482 --> 00:41:33,252
I tried calling but
you didn't hear me.

374
00:41:33,285 --> 00:41:34,119
- What were...
- It's nothing.

375
00:41:34,153 --> 00:41:35,421
It's nothing.

376
00:41:35,454 --> 00:41:36,822
You could have
injured yourself.

377
00:41:36,855 --> 00:41:37,990
I was exercising.

378
00:42:11,323 --> 00:42:14,827
Your mother suggested
that maybe we should,

379
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,329
I mean, I should
try and talk to you,

380
00:42:17,362 --> 00:42:19,364
just to see if
everything was all right.

381
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:29,908
How long has she
been so religious?

382
00:42:31,376 --> 00:42:32,811
When we moved to Tanzania,

383
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,149
first she just wants
us to have a community

384
00:42:37,182 --> 00:42:39,651
but then she got really
serious about it.

385
00:42:39,685 --> 00:42:40,586
Then you?

386
00:42:41,854 --> 00:42:43,288
Then as long as
I'm reading the Bible

387
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:45,557
she doesn't get on
my case too much.

388
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:54,433
Do you miss home?

389
00:42:57,402 --> 00:42:58,370
Don't you?

390
00:43:00,339 --> 00:43:04,376
Well after the war, the
home that I knew was gone.

391
00:43:12,451 --> 00:43:16,755
Do you mind if I share why,

392
00:43:16,788 --> 00:43:18,223
or wait her to finish.

393
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,093
My mom will be
upset if she knows

394
00:43:21,126 --> 00:43:22,327
I didn't give you my bed.

395
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:26,098
No, no no. She
doesn't have to know.

396
00:43:39,611 --> 00:43:41,780
I can turn off the light.

397
00:43:41,813 --> 00:43:43,382
No no no, keep exercising.

398
00:43:45,617 --> 00:43:46,485
It was finished.

399
00:44:00,265 --> 00:44:00,967
Linda.

400
00:44:03,402 --> 00:44:04,169
Yes dad.

401
00:44:06,238 --> 00:44:11,243
This country is very
hard for black people

402
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,580
especially foreigners.

403
00:44:15,847 --> 00:44:19,484
You always have to carry
yourself in a certain way

404
00:44:19,518 --> 00:44:24,523
so that white people
don't feel threatened.

405
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:29,661
So when we get to dance,
that's the one place

406
00:44:29,695 --> 00:44:34,633
that I can actually be
myself, show myself.

407
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:45,979
So be yourself, you're the only
one who knows what you know,

408
00:44:46,845 --> 00:44:49,348
and who can do what you do.

409
00:44:57,456 --> 00:44:58,223
Yes Bai.

410
00:45:29,221 --> 00:45:30,389
It's the one that
you sent to mama

411
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:32,058
when we first moved to Tanzania.

412
00:45:35,193 --> 00:45:37,362
I liked it so she
let me wear it.

413
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:48,607
Anywhere else?

414
00:45:50,175 --> 00:45:52,511
There is a little bruise,
but nothing too unusual.

415
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,980
Where did you learn this song?

416
00:46:29,314 --> 00:46:31,150
Different parties
in Dar es Salaam.

417
00:46:32,384 --> 00:46:36,288
Everybody would dance
to it and cry, cry, cry.

418
00:46:39,158 --> 00:46:41,127
Till Mama stopped
going to the parties.

419
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:44,964
She didn't want me
to dance anymore.

420
00:46:58,643 --> 00:47:00,479
Can I get the
apartments for $1,000?

421
00:47:02,347 --> 00:47:04,583
Depends wherever
you are currently.

422
00:47:04,616 --> 00:47:06,752
Are you planning on
running away or something?

423
00:47:10,756 --> 00:47:12,691
I'm just planning
for the future.

424
00:47:14,326 --> 00:47:16,294
You can do this.

425
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:17,130
Thanks.

426
00:47:44,723 --> 00:47:48,460
Five,
six, seven, here we go.

427
00:47:51,230 --> 00:47:52,265
What are you doing?

428
00:47:52,297 --> 00:47:53,498
What was that?

429
00:47:53,532 --> 00:47:54,432
Nothing, it
was just something...

430
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:55,935
Did you see me do that?

431
00:47:55,968 --> 00:47:58,303
- No, I...
- Don't do that.

432
00:47:58,336 --> 00:47:59,538
We have a routine.

433
00:47:59,571 --> 00:48:00,672
All we needed someone
to learn a routine

434
00:48:00,705 --> 00:48:02,275
and execute it the way
it needs to be done.

435
00:48:02,307 --> 00:48:03,708
Now can you do that or not?

436
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:13,186
Get away from me?

437
00:48:14,486 --> 00:48:15,720
What happened?

438
00:48:15,754 --> 00:48:16,822
I told you I can't
stop it you insisted.

439
00:48:16,855 --> 00:48:18,490
And now you've embarrassed me.

440
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:22,828
Calm down, I saw you up
there learning the moves.

441
00:48:22,861 --> 00:48:23,963
You're doing great.

442
00:48:23,996 --> 00:48:25,131
Well, your friend
has a problem with me

443
00:48:25,164 --> 00:48:27,732
because she could
poke poke me like I'm.

444
00:48:27,766 --> 00:48:28,867
Like I'm a Shish kebab.

445
00:48:37,709 --> 00:48:41,847
Boy, okay.

446
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:42,681
Come on.

447
00:48:43,882 --> 00:48:45,952
Let me just take you
Shish kabash asshole.

448
00:49:17,816 --> 00:49:19,718
- The bathroom is down there.
- Cool.

449
00:49:26,325 --> 00:49:28,227
Sorry, it's a mess.

450
00:49:28,261 --> 00:49:29,794
I don't usually have guests.

451
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:31,264
No, it's cool. It's cool.

452
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:34,799
Who's that?

453
00:49:38,436 --> 00:49:40,072
That's Neema.

454
00:49:40,106 --> 00:49:42,641
My best friend from back home.

455
00:49:43,808 --> 00:49:44,910
She's a DJ.

456
00:49:46,312 --> 00:49:47,113
Word.

457
00:49:49,748 --> 00:49:50,849
You miss it there?

458
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:58,357
My friends think my
life is perfect now.

459
00:49:59,758 --> 00:50:03,062
They think having a
celebrity, crazy partying.

460
00:50:03,095 --> 00:50:04,429
All my family's down South,

461
00:50:04,462 --> 00:50:06,198
so I get the same thing.

462
00:50:07,766 --> 00:50:09,768
I remember the year really
knows what it's like there.

463
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:13,205
So, you just feel alone.

464
00:50:14,439 --> 00:50:15,807
What about your parents?

465
00:50:17,842 --> 00:50:19,345
They are complicated.

466
00:50:21,948 --> 00:50:26,685
My dad, isn't really a diplomat.

467
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:31,523
I figured, you don't
really hear about

468
00:50:31,556 --> 00:50:33,458
too many diplomats
living in the hood.

469
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:43,002
I know how it feels
without my paps.

470
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:46,038
I know how it feels.

471
00:50:51,543 --> 00:50:53,878
So what you going to
do after graduation?

472
00:50:56,983 --> 00:50:58,616
I don't know.

473
00:50:58,650 --> 00:51:01,820
Maybe start working, go to
State college or something.

474
00:51:01,853 --> 00:51:03,456
You're not going to
continue with the stage

475
00:51:03,488 --> 00:51:04,889
lights and promotion?

476
00:51:04,923 --> 00:51:07,859
Well, not unless you become
a famous dancer Miss Sylvia.

477
00:51:09,594 --> 00:51:10,895
Sylvia.

478
00:51:10,930 --> 00:51:13,665
Sorry mama, I
didn't know you were-

479
00:51:13,698 --> 00:51:16,601
- Hi Ma'am. I'm a Devin Jamison.

480
00:51:17,602 --> 00:51:19,405
How are you, Devin Jamison?

481
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:22,707
I'm good.

482
00:51:22,741 --> 00:51:24,210
You have a lovely home Ma'am.

483
00:51:24,243 --> 00:51:25,643
You've seen my home?

484
00:51:25,677 --> 00:51:26,878
Just the bathroom.

485
00:51:26,911 --> 00:51:29,748
Sorry mama, I didn't
know you were home.

486
00:51:29,781 --> 00:51:32,084
So you brought a man home
when you thought I wasn't home.

487
00:51:32,118 --> 00:51:33,718
No.

488
00:51:33,752 --> 00:51:35,687
I just wanted to make sure
that Sylvia got home safe

489
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:37,056
after dance tryouts.

490
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:42,361
I probably should be heading
home to do some homework.

491
00:51:42,395 --> 00:51:45,864
Yes. Say hello
to your parents.

492
00:51:46,898 --> 00:51:48,200
Okay.

493
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:49,634
I'll see you tomorrow.

494
00:51:50,869 --> 00:51:51,937
Excuse me ma'am.

495
00:51:53,705 --> 00:51:54,906
You can do anything Mama.

496
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,708
You just say squats to me home.

497
00:52:26,338 --> 00:52:30,142
Linda, If you and I
going to dinner tonight.

498
00:52:42,288 --> 00:52:47,293
I don't know what's gotten into
you, but I expected better.

499
00:52:48,494 --> 00:52:49,828
You know, I only do
this for your own good

500
00:52:49,861 --> 00:52:53,731
because I can see
things you can't.

501
00:52:53,765 --> 00:52:56,168
Your father and I doing
best to protect you.

502
00:53:11,616 --> 00:53:14,386
From now on, you go to school,

503
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:16,989
you come straight back.

504
00:53:18,124 --> 00:53:23,162
No friends, no activities
and no dancing.

505
00:53:29,301 --> 00:53:30,169
Are you listening?

506
00:53:39,677 --> 00:53:41,746
This hurts me more
than it hurts you,

507
00:53:43,349 --> 00:53:48,354
but you will repent and seek
forgiveness for what you did.

508
00:54:08,007 --> 00:54:12,578
Our Father who is at heaven,

509
00:54:13,878 --> 00:54:16,015
hallowed be Thy name,

510
00:54:16,048 --> 00:54:18,017
Thy kingdom come.

511
00:54:18,050 --> 00:54:23,055
Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven.

512
00:54:23,956 --> 00:54:25,191
Give us this day
our daily bread.

513
00:54:26,358 --> 00:54:28,927
And forgive us our trespasses.

514
00:54:30,695 --> 00:54:33,165
What is she doing?

515
00:54:33,199 --> 00:54:38,204
I will not lose my
daughter to this country.

516
00:55:06,265 --> 00:55:07,732
Family is here now.

517
00:55:09,101 --> 00:55:10,069
This is for you.

518
00:55:10,102 --> 00:55:11,604
Thank you.

519
00:55:11,637 --> 00:55:13,439
This one is for you.

520
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:16,242
Come.

521
00:56:12,998 --> 00:56:14,500
For the gift of food,

522
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:17,202
for the gift of shelter that
you have provided for me

523
00:56:17,236 --> 00:56:18,704
and my family.

524
00:56:20,205 --> 00:56:22,141
Praise Jesus for this day,

525
00:56:22,174 --> 00:56:24,310
and my boss be
free from trouble.

526
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:26,245
And the destructive
hand of Satan.

527
00:56:27,179 --> 00:56:29,114
May I return safely from school,

528
00:56:29,148 --> 00:56:31,483
and may dad return
safely from America,

529
00:56:32,384 --> 00:56:36,221
I mean, work, amen.

530
00:56:36,255 --> 00:56:37,323
Amen.

531
00:56:39,591 --> 00:56:40,492
It's
a passage of scripture

532
00:56:40,526 --> 00:56:42,661
that always fascinated me.

533
00:57:59,338 --> 00:58:00,406
You always do this.

534
00:58:00,439 --> 00:58:02,374
And I should have
listened to my soul.

535
00:58:02,408 --> 00:58:04,443
I should've listened
to my spirit

536
00:58:06,145 --> 00:58:08,547
because this is airy bullshit.

537
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:10,649
So narcissist,
this it's so good.

538
00:58:13,685 --> 00:58:14,653
And You know what?

539
00:58:14,686 --> 00:58:16,321
I don't have time for this.

540
00:58:16,355 --> 00:58:18,323
I don't have the
psychic bandwidth.

541
00:58:19,358 --> 00:58:21,093
You know what don't act up

542
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:23,462
is that we have to
act and work together.

543
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:29,902
All right, you know
what we're done,

544
00:58:29,935 --> 00:58:31,103
come and get your shit.

545
00:58:41,814 --> 00:58:43,148
Who is it?

546
00:58:43,182 --> 00:58:44,917
Henzinga, from next door.

547
00:58:47,553 --> 00:58:48,654
Just a moment.

548
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:00,799
Is Walter still live here?

549
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:03,502
I'm afraid he's at
work at the moment.

550
00:59:04,736 --> 00:59:05,971
I'm his wife, Esther.

551
00:59:06,004 --> 00:59:09,274
Pleased to meet you queen.

552
00:59:09,308 --> 00:59:10,742
Pleased to meet you too

553
00:59:12,377 --> 00:59:13,846
Queen?

554
00:59:13,879 --> 00:59:15,481
Excuse me, I was just
cleaning the house

555
00:59:15,514 --> 00:59:17,483
but you're welcome
to come inside.

556
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:19,351
No sorry, I just
wanted to drop off some mail

557
00:59:19,384 --> 00:59:21,053
that was put in my box.

558
00:59:21,086 --> 00:59:22,554
I will make sure I
give them to my husband

559
00:59:22,588 --> 00:59:23,889
when he comes home.

560
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:25,557
Okay. Peace.

561
00:59:42,608 --> 00:59:44,910
He who is build
together with the Lord,

562
00:59:44,944 --> 00:59:47,913
let no man tear at sudden.

563
00:59:47,947 --> 00:59:50,315
You know my heart, Lord.

564
00:59:50,349 --> 00:59:51,450
You know my struggles.

565
00:59:54,954 --> 00:59:56,188
It's the word of God,

566
00:59:56,221 --> 00:59:57,356
that need to follow.

567
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:00,692
Some of us are trying
to lead our families

568
01:00:00,726 --> 01:00:03,095
With the temptations.

569
01:00:38,564 --> 01:00:39,598
How are you queen?

570
01:00:40,566 --> 01:00:41,867
Fine. Thank you.

571
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:43,068
You've been shopping?

572
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:45,939
Did you go to the Korean
market on the corner?

573
01:00:45,972 --> 01:00:48,574
Sometimes their food
isn't always so fresh.

574
01:00:48,607 --> 01:00:50,977
I was looking for some
millet flour for Walter.

575
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,311
He has the cholesterol, so.

576
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:53,545
You know, I can take you

577
01:00:53,579 --> 01:00:55,414
to the Egyptian market
where I get my food.

578
01:00:55,447 --> 01:00:56,748
I'm heading there now.

579
01:00:56,782 --> 01:00:57,749
No, I don't want
to disturb you.

580
01:00:57,783 --> 01:00:59,451
It's really no problem.

581
01:01:10,529 --> 01:01:13,231
Your neighborhood
is dramatically.

582
01:01:13,265 --> 01:01:15,601
We used to have a lot of people.

583
01:01:19,939 --> 01:01:20,806
It's very busy.

584
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:22,507
Yeah. It's very busy.

585
01:01:26,378 --> 01:01:28,380
Alaikum salaam,
good to see you.

586
01:01:37,456 --> 01:01:38,490
You eat very healthy.

587
01:01:39,791 --> 01:01:41,159
You know I try.

588
01:01:42,494 --> 01:01:45,197
I'm doing much better that
I'm not in a relationship.

589
01:01:46,531 --> 01:01:49,368
I am just grateful the time
finally reunited with Walter

590
01:01:49,401 --> 01:01:54,373
after so many years apart and
I must've struggled a lot.

591
01:01:55,641 --> 01:01:56,541
I was wondering
how he learned how

592
01:01:56,575 --> 01:01:58,510
to cook all these low fat foods.

593
01:01:59,578 --> 01:02:01,446
Maybe you helped him.

594
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:02,814
You know how men are.

595
01:02:02,848 --> 01:02:04,883
They know how to
find their resources.

596
01:02:09,655 --> 01:02:11,523
Was that a woman
named Linda who lived

597
01:02:11,556 --> 01:02:13,558
in the apartment
before Walter moved in?

598
01:02:15,661 --> 01:02:17,863
Did you get more
ashwagandha powder this week?

599
01:02:17,896 --> 01:02:19,331
- No, ma'am.
- No.

600
01:02:20,532 --> 01:02:22,634
You know what, sometimes
it takes them so long

601
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:24,169
to restock their items

602
01:02:24,202 --> 01:02:27,073
but I really want to support
the local businesses.

603
01:02:28,206 --> 01:02:30,776
And this brokers are Africans.

604
01:02:32,577 --> 01:02:34,680
You know we should head back.

605
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:35,614
Did you get your flour?

606
01:02:37,516 --> 01:02:38,417
Yes. Thank you.

607
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:53,231
Thank you Lord.

608
01:03:04,376 --> 01:03:06,645
You have 30 minutes
for this call.

609
01:03:08,613 --> 01:03:10,716
May your name be blessed.

610
01:03:14,753 --> 01:03:16,221
Hello.

611
01:03:18,223 --> 01:03:20,225
Sister Redemter?

612
01:03:20,258 --> 01:03:22,561
My Esther.

613
01:03:22,594 --> 01:03:23,895
How are you settling in?

614
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:32,105
It is a
challenge, my sister.

615
01:03:32,138 --> 01:03:33,638
I'm home mostly by myself

616
01:03:33,672 --> 01:03:36,608
so usually I just
thinking, thinking,

617
01:03:38,677 --> 01:03:40,445
missing my community there.

618
01:03:53,592 --> 01:03:56,095
How is our
Sylvia doing over there?

619
01:03:57,829 --> 01:03:59,531
She's trying her best.

620
01:04:04,536 --> 01:04:06,605
In Jesus name,
save Sylvia please.

621
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:08,340
Guide her.

622
01:04:13,980 --> 01:04:15,781
And how's Walter?

623
01:04:18,050 --> 01:04:21,620
He's
working very hard.

624
01:04:22,788 --> 01:04:25,357
His life here is so difficult.

625
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:26,825
I don't believe
you're married.

626
01:04:26,858 --> 01:04:28,995
I usually go to them on week
days because am usually back

627
01:04:29,028 --> 01:04:30,695
home on Sundays.

628
01:04:30,729 --> 01:04:33,266
Welcome to our flock.

629
01:04:40,705 --> 01:04:45,377
But I'm trying my best to
help him and to pray for him.

630
01:04:45,410 --> 01:04:48,981
Protect Walter and
guide him please.

631
01:04:50,183 --> 01:04:52,684
He's the head Father God.

632
01:04:52,717 --> 01:04:55,154
I am
proud of you my sister.

633
01:04:55,188 --> 01:04:58,490
You endured many many
years of hardships,

634
01:04:58,523 --> 01:05:01,326
and stayed faithful
to God's command.

635
01:05:04,863 --> 01:05:07,499
Don't forget to
send your offerings.

636
01:05:07,532 --> 01:05:09,701
We must always give thanks.

637
01:05:09,734 --> 01:05:13,206
Especially when God
answers our prayers.

638
01:05:40,899 --> 01:05:41,733
I'm not hungry.

639
01:05:43,802 --> 01:05:45,171
I thought you might say that.

640
01:05:45,204 --> 01:05:49,808
So I made you a flask of
tea with some olds today.

641
01:05:50,909 --> 01:05:51,877
And a little sugar.

642
01:05:53,212 --> 01:05:55,614
You work so hard
to look after us,

643
01:05:56,481 --> 01:05:58,117
allow me to now look after you.

644
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:04,090
Thank you, it's very nice.

645
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:12,965
No, thank you.

646
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,468
And how was your day?

647
01:06:17,903 --> 01:06:20,572
You know, the usual things.

648
01:06:22,841 --> 01:06:24,377
I had a question.

649
01:06:24,409 --> 01:06:28,080
I had some money that I
kept in case of an emergency

650
01:06:28,114 --> 01:06:31,250
and I thought maybe you
could help me send it

651
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:33,885
to our church in Dar El Salaam?.

652
01:06:33,919 --> 01:06:37,223
They have been praying
for us for so many years.

653
01:06:37,256 --> 01:06:40,926
It should be offering of thanks.

654
01:06:43,195 --> 01:06:45,897
I can send it through on
my lunch break tomorrow.

655
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:48,167
There's transfer
place near work.

656
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,302
That's wonderful.

657
01:07:08,988 --> 01:07:10,256
How much money is this?

658
01:07:10,289 --> 01:07:11,958
$1,000.

659
01:07:11,991 --> 01:07:13,792
You're sending
the church, 1000?

660
01:07:14,961 --> 01:07:16,928
Yes, this is for several years

661
01:07:16,963 --> 01:07:18,797
I kept it in case
of an emergency.

662
01:07:18,830 --> 01:07:20,967
But now that God
has delivered us...

663
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,568
He hasn't, He
hasn't delivered us.

664
01:07:26,205 --> 01:07:27,306
We are here.

665
01:07:28,473 --> 01:07:29,708
Yes, yes. Do you
know what that means?

666
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:31,876
Means I have to work
harder than before

667
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:33,346
and we have less than before.

668
01:07:33,379 --> 01:07:37,049
All this time I've been working
double and triple shifts.

669
01:07:37,083 --> 01:07:39,517
Do you know what we could
have done with this money?

670
01:07:39,551 --> 01:07:44,357
This money is
for God

671
01:07:44,390 --> 01:07:45,890
so that he will favor us.

672
01:07:47,059 --> 01:07:50,862
As we rebuild our
family, our marriage.

673
01:07:53,032 --> 01:07:55,067
I can't do this right now.

674
01:08:21,593 --> 01:08:22,861
Next.

675
01:08:22,894 --> 01:08:25,031
Yes, I'd like
to send this money

676
01:08:25,064 --> 01:08:27,400
to Dar El Salaam, Tanzania.

677
01:08:27,433 --> 01:08:28,234
Your ID?

678
01:08:45,884 --> 01:08:47,053
Sister Redemta?

679
01:08:47,086 --> 01:08:48,753
How
are you my child?

680
01:08:48,787 --> 01:08:51,157
I sent the money, but...

681
01:08:52,458 --> 01:08:54,193
What is the problem?

682
01:08:54,226 --> 01:08:56,328
Tell me what is in your heart.

683
01:08:58,064 --> 01:08:58,830
It's just,

684
01:09:02,468 --> 01:09:03,269
I think

685
01:09:06,472 --> 01:09:11,477
I think we might
be unequally yoked.

686
01:09:13,012 --> 01:09:16,215
Unequally yoked? Dah!

687
01:09:16,248 --> 01:09:17,450
Yes sister.

688
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:19,918
What can I do?

689
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,489
He's the man that
God has given me.

690
01:09:23,522 --> 01:09:28,427
And why would he do that if
there wasn't a reason for it.

691
01:09:29,962 --> 01:09:33,566
God would not
lead you to the desert

692
01:09:33,598 --> 01:09:34,866
and abandon you.

693
01:09:36,135 --> 01:09:40,772
That dutiful wife who prays
for husband and family,

694
01:09:40,805 --> 01:09:43,442
would be head fast.

695
01:09:43,476 --> 01:09:47,947
Continue to pray,
increase your offering.

696
01:09:48,847 --> 01:09:50,915
You cannot give up.

697
01:09:50,950 --> 01:09:52,817
Now bow your head.

698
01:09:52,851 --> 01:09:54,053
Let's pray together.

699
01:09:55,454 --> 01:10:00,092
Heavenly father, we come
before you with sister Esther,

700
01:10:00,126 --> 01:10:03,963
Lord we ask you
to give her peace.

701
01:11:15,301 --> 01:11:19,704
We are going to with the
stage lights and promotion.

702
01:11:19,737 --> 01:11:22,074
Unless you become a
famous dancer Miss Sylvia.

703
01:11:25,877 --> 01:11:26,645
Sylvia.

704
01:11:28,713 --> 01:11:32,051
She is a teenager,
it's not to annoy us,

705
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:33,452
just calm down.

706
01:11:34,819 --> 01:11:36,388
Let's just take a moment.

707
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:39,225
Let's go ahead and talk.

708
01:11:39,258 --> 01:11:41,227
I don't think you
understand Walter.

709
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:44,129
This is not the time
for going out to dinner.

710
01:11:44,163 --> 01:11:46,898
Clearly we need to be at
home watching our daughter.

711
01:11:53,439 --> 01:11:54,206
Who?

712
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,975
Esther.

713
01:11:56,008 --> 01:11:57,243
Who?

714
01:11:57,276 --> 01:12:00,112
Esther. Walter's wife.

715
01:12:05,317 --> 01:12:06,085
How are you?

716
01:12:06,118 --> 01:12:07,752
I'm fine, thank you.

717
01:12:09,188 --> 01:12:12,491
I wanted to ask you a
favor please my sister.

718
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:14,792
I'm going to dinner
with Walter tonight

719
01:12:14,826 --> 01:12:18,597
and I need to borrow just a
pest to go with this outfit.

720
01:12:23,801 --> 01:12:27,172
Girl, you're gonna be
way more than just a purse.

721
01:12:28,107 --> 01:12:28,873
Come on.

722
01:12:31,710 --> 01:12:32,511
Come on.

723
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:38,217
So where are you
going for dinner?

724
01:12:40,119 --> 01:12:41,987
I'm not sure,
he didn't tell me.

725
01:12:42,021 --> 01:12:44,957
So it's a surprise.

726
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:47,159
All right. That's nice of him.

727
01:12:47,192 --> 01:12:50,029
Well, actually we
have been talking

728
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:55,067
about this for a while, but
today's not really a good day.

729
01:12:56,302 --> 01:12:57,136
That's nonsense,
life is short.

730
01:12:57,169 --> 01:12:59,071
You can't put stuff on hold.

731
01:13:01,407 --> 01:13:04,209
Okay. I agree, you're right.

732
01:13:05,511 --> 01:13:10,516
Good, so we need
to looking Royal.

733
01:13:16,055 --> 01:13:17,790
Actually I am a Christian.

734
01:13:17,822 --> 01:13:20,326
So nothing too...

735
01:13:23,395 --> 01:13:27,132
Honey, you're out here worried
about another woman's male.

736
01:13:27,166 --> 01:13:29,368
When you're hiding the
essence of your womanhood

737
01:13:29,401 --> 01:13:31,203
from your own husband?

738
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:33,505
Is that really what
white Jesus wants?

739
01:13:39,345 --> 01:13:43,248
Sometimes a King names his queen

740
01:13:43,282 --> 01:13:45,351
to remind him who she is.

741
01:13:46,884 --> 01:13:47,619
Now, come on.

742
01:13:59,098 --> 01:14:01,200
You look very beautiful.

743
01:14:03,969 --> 01:14:05,137
I'm glad you like it.

744
01:14:06,372 --> 01:14:07,406
Can I get
you anything else?

745
01:14:07,439 --> 01:14:09,608
Coffee please.

746
01:14:09,641 --> 01:14:13,379
No, thank you.

747
01:14:13,412 --> 01:14:16,014
Thank you for bringing me here.

748
01:14:16,048 --> 01:14:17,416
It's very nice.

749
01:14:30,662 --> 01:14:33,732
Remember when life was simple,

750
01:14:35,667 --> 01:14:38,971
when a fancy night was
sitting on the beach

751
01:14:40,672 --> 01:14:42,341
having fish over fire.

752
01:14:43,842 --> 01:14:44,909
What was she blind?

753
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:50,915
Red snapper with
Jedungo hoka.

754
01:14:51,617 --> 01:14:52,484
And plantains.

755
01:14:53,952 --> 01:14:56,188
From Donna Megalish
place on the corner.

756
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:58,323
Did she survive?

757
01:15:02,461 --> 01:15:04,329
I'm not even sure.

758
01:15:06,365 --> 01:15:10,669
After we left for Tanzania I
lost touch with so many people.

759
01:15:33,225 --> 01:15:34,293
Let's dance.

760
01:15:36,061 --> 01:15:36,829
Where?

761
01:15:36,862 --> 01:15:38,932
Here, on this side.

762
01:15:38,964 --> 01:15:40,098
We can't do that.

763
01:15:40,132 --> 01:15:41,633
Why not?

764
01:15:41,667 --> 01:15:43,302
The band is warming up.

765
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:46,004
Shouldn't we wait for them
to start the party properly?

766
01:15:47,339 --> 01:15:48,874
I'm not stopping.

767
01:15:48,907 --> 01:15:51,945
Come join me.

768
01:15:51,977 --> 01:15:54,213
You are embarrassing yourself.

769
01:15:55,047 --> 01:15:56,882
Then come rescue me.

770
01:15:56,915 --> 01:15:58,517
We'll be embarrassed together.

771
01:16:16,602 --> 01:16:20,405
See, it's working.

772
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:22,942
It has been so long I
don't even remember how.

773
01:16:34,253 --> 01:16:37,122
You're always
the most beautiful,

774
01:16:38,290 --> 01:16:39,391
when you dance.

775
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:51,630
From the donation box.

776
01:18:02,541 --> 01:18:04,476
- Wait.
- Get rid of this.

777
01:18:04,509 --> 01:18:05,611
It's a rule.

778
01:18:05,644 --> 01:18:08,513
I have heard you
Walter, loud and clear.

779
01:18:08,547 --> 01:18:10,315
You don't want me,

780
01:18:12,451 --> 01:18:14,053
you want something else.

781
01:18:18,457 --> 01:18:21,893
This was too big for us
to not lose ourselves.

782
01:18:27,132 --> 01:18:28,600
I want to go back home.

783
01:19:38,704 --> 01:19:41,606
I need to know who she is.

784
01:19:47,579 --> 01:19:49,015
You're ready to kill
it at the cyber today?

785
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:52,884
Yeah, Neema made
me a special dance.

786
01:20:38,864 --> 01:20:41,900
You get out of here
forget about dancing.

787
01:20:41,934 --> 01:20:43,869
Forget about everything.

788
01:20:46,772 --> 01:20:47,906
Thanks DJ.

789
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,574
For what?

790
01:20:49,608 --> 01:20:51,309
Everything.

791
01:20:51,343 --> 01:20:52,544
You know I catch you.

792
01:21:06,725 --> 01:21:07,893
I was, you know.

793
01:21:23,708 --> 01:21:25,844
I'm looking for my daughter.

794
01:21:25,877 --> 01:21:27,312
She is a dancer.

795
01:22:07,752 --> 01:22:09,821
We have Judy Joseph.

796
01:22:16,795 --> 01:22:18,830
Our reigning champion.

797
01:22:27,873 --> 01:22:32,644
Let's take a five minute break
before we get to this next round.

798
01:22:57,003 --> 01:22:58,070
Where are you going?

799
01:22:58,104 --> 01:22:59,404
I have to go.

800
01:22:59,437 --> 01:23:00,805
I made a mistake,

801
01:23:02,774 --> 01:23:03,575
I have to go.

802
01:23:03,608 --> 01:23:05,610
Sylvia, hold on.

803
01:23:14,753 --> 01:23:16,821
We have to go find her.

804
01:23:22,627 --> 01:23:23,628
She's all I have.

805
01:23:24,931 --> 01:23:26,999
This is my
responsibility Vinnia, go.

806
01:23:31,370 --> 01:23:33,039
Fight for your dance.

807
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:36,275
I'll find her.

808
01:24:24,256 --> 01:24:25,824
Up next
ladies and gentlemen,

809
01:24:25,857 --> 01:24:27,960
our defeating Sylvia Lako
as a free to a battle

810
01:24:27,994 --> 01:24:30,662
with the new kid on
the block, Your Africa.

811
01:27:54,866 --> 01:27:56,368
I have been lost.

812
01:28:02,041 --> 01:28:03,808
And Linda found you.

813
01:28:06,312 --> 01:28:08,880
she gives me hope as dad.

814
01:28:08,913 --> 01:28:13,252
She insists that I don't give
up and I keep petitioning

815
01:28:13,285 --> 01:28:16,121
immigration, for
us to be together.

816
01:28:31,937 --> 01:28:33,606
You think it was easy for me?

817
01:28:33,639 --> 01:28:34,906
Of course not.

818
01:28:36,175 --> 01:28:37,643
I lost so many years.

819
01:28:41,746 --> 01:28:42,581
Sorry.

820
01:28:48,087 --> 01:28:51,156
We don't even know
each other anymore.

821
01:28:53,158 --> 01:28:54,293
Or our child.

822
01:28:58,130 --> 01:28:59,331
When we met,

823
01:29:03,369 --> 01:29:06,138
I didn't know if I
could see the next day.

824
01:29:07,872 --> 01:29:09,608
I didn't know who was a comrade,

825
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:12,211
who was an informant,

826
01:29:13,545 --> 01:29:15,114
who was there for the light.

827
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:30,129
When I move, you follow.

828
01:29:32,830 --> 01:29:35,634
When you hesitate, I slow down.

829
01:29:39,405 --> 01:29:41,307
'Cause we could feel each other.

830
01:29:50,716 --> 01:29:51,550
So,

831
01:29:56,422 --> 01:29:58,057
what do we do now?

832
01:31:59,111 --> 01:32:02,114
I said you went dancing.

833
01:32:02,147 --> 01:32:03,348
What happened?

834
01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:05,317
The crowd.

835
01:32:07,686 --> 01:32:09,488
They really liked me mama.

836
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:15,561
They saw me.

837
01:32:16,528 --> 01:32:17,830
Of course they did.

838
01:32:20,833 --> 01:32:25,838
We will see you, we do.

839
01:32:36,348 --> 01:32:38,050
Make us pray first.
