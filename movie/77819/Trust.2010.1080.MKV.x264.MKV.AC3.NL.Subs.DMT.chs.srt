(Doug) Okay. Good news.

We ran the DNA from his shirt

That's, that's incredible.

1315
01:18:58,067 --> 01:18:59,660
So what happens now? You arrest him?

1316
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:01,282
(Doug) It's not that easy.
没那么简单 

1317
01:19:01,362 --> 01:19:03,535
While the DNA is on the database
就算他的DNA在数据库中

1318
01:19:03,614 --> 01:19:06,037
it's still a John Doe- We don't know who it belongs to.
也只是属于某个人的-我们并不知道那个人是谁 

1319
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,538
I don't understand.
我不明白

1320

Well, there were other cases, Will

three of them, where rapes were reported.

from the victim and the crime scene.

The DNA profile is the same.
DNA检测结果都属于同一个人

1325
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,629
It's just that we don't know who it belongs to.
但我们并不知道这个人是谁

1326
01:19:18,712 --> 01:19:20,714
So he's done this before.
也就是说他是惯犯 

1327
01:19:20,798 --> 01:19:23,096
- Yes, he has. - (Lynn) Oh, my God.
-是的，没错 -噢，我的天

1328

1331

Well, DNA can be wrong.
好吧，DNA也可能有错 

1332
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,897
The odds of these four samples not coming from the same person
这四个样本不是来自同一个人的概率

1333
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:38,779
are in the hundreds of millions. It's the same guy.
只有万分之一，证明这是一个人干的

1334
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:41,485
Now, look. We, uh, we don't normally do this.
你们看，呃，我们一般不这样做

1335
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,286
We 're very careful with victim information.
我们要小心保护受害人的信息 

1336
01:19:43,362 --> 01:19:44,989
But I'm hoping there might be some kind
但是我认为在你们四个女孩之间

1337
01:19:45,072 --> 01:19:47,495
of connection between all four of you girls.

Maybe you went to the same camp together

you shopped at the same mall.

1341
01:19:53,372 --> 01:19:55,750
you might take a look at their pictures.
你可以看看她们的照片 

1342
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:57,301
(Lynn) Wait a minute. I don't know if this is a good idea.
等等，我不知道这是不是个好主意 

1343
01:19:57,376 --> 01:19:59,879
No, no. I want, I want to. Yeah.

It looks that way, yeah.
