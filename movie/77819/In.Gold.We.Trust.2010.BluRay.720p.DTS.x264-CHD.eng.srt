1
00:00:57,459 --> 00:00:59,803
Go on, kiss the baby for us.

2
00:01:01,959 --> 00:01:04,007
Kiss your wife.

3
00:01:14,335 --> 00:01:16,633
Go ahead, Lionel. Any news?

4
00:01:16,876 --> 00:01:19,595
I spoke to Remi.
We have to act fast

5
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,011
before the gold leaves Guyana.

6
00:01:22,168 --> 00:01:24,637
Canadian Gold's 3 sending it
to Switzerland.

7
00:01:25,294 --> 00:01:28,173
OK, I'm on my way
to delivery gas to them.

8
00:01:28,377 --> 00:01:29,469
They have no idea.

9
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:32,426
You get the others.
I'll call from Cayenne.

10
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:33,883
Roger.

11
00:01:39,045 --> 00:01:42,128
That was Virgil
to know if we needed gas.

12
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,009
I said he's too dear.

13
00:01:46,212 --> 00:01:48,681
Tell him to stop working
with illegals.

14
00:01:49,503 --> 00:01:51,005
He'll get caught.

15
00:02:32,841 --> 00:02:33,683
Gentlemen...

16
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:37,558
Hi, Roger.

17
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,634
- How are things?
- OK, you?

18
00:02:39,882 --> 00:02:41,099
Thanks.

19
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:43,760
- Beer?
- You bet.

20
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:48,009
You're late.

21
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:51,885
You can still pay up.

22
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,349
Pay him for his 3 barrels of gas.

23
00:04:31,391 --> 00:04:32,267
They're here.

24
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:38,984
In Gold We Trust

25
00:06:22,316 --> 00:06:24,410
- Hi, Maurice.
- Hi.

26
00:06:25,691 --> 00:06:27,534
The equipment's here.

27
00:06:27,691 --> 00:06:29,318
Thank you.

28
00:06:29,609 --> 00:06:31,407
I'll pick it up later.

29
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,948
I'm not asking any questions.

30
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,528
I should hope not,
at that price!

31
00:06:39,234 --> 00:06:40,406
Enjoy your meal.

32
00:06:44,401 --> 00:06:47,405
Gotta wait for the gas.
The cops are onto me.

33
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:50,161
I'm quitting, anyway.

34
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,453
I'm retiring.

35
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:22,998
We're not going
into the jungle, I hope.

36
00:07:25,113 --> 00:07:26,706
Good to see you.

37
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:32,156
Hear about Miguel?

38
00:07:32,321 --> 00:07:35,404
3 months after Zimbabwe,
he shot himself.

39
00:07:35,572 --> 00:07:37,370
All by himself!

40
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,453
Scared you'll be next?

41
00:07:40,072 --> 00:07:42,791
I quit. I got a restaurant now.

42
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,242
It's in the South of France.

43
00:07:47,573 --> 00:07:50,622
Look. Business is booming.

44
00:07:51,448 --> 00:07:52,950
That's why you're here!

45
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,291
I get bored when I stay still.

46
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,372
I won't spend my life
serving seafood!

47
00:08:05,532 --> 00:08:07,785
Is Lionel still around?

48
00:08:08,407 --> 00:08:09,784
Looking for gold.

49
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,167
How is he?

50
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:14,038
Married.

51
00:08:15,742 --> 00:08:17,119
But he's in.

52
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:28,290
Couldn't you find anyone else?

53
00:08:28,784 --> 00:08:30,661
No-one as efficient.

54
00:08:32,201 --> 00:08:33,623
OK, pal?

55
00:08:35,201 --> 00:08:36,202
YOU met?

56
00:08:37,826 --> 00:08:38,577
Let's go.

57
00:08:44,077 --> 00:08:45,499
Where'd you come from?

58
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:47,037
Caracas.

59
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,750
What's wrong with planes?

60
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,662
I'm not in a hurry.

61
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:55,088
Why don't you tell us your plan?

62
00:08:55,245 --> 00:08:56,872
600 kilos of gold.

63
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:04,039
It's virtually a good deed,

64
00:09:04,203 --> 00:09:07,127
because Canadian Gold
doesn't just mine gold.

65
00:09:07,287 --> 00:09:09,756
It also recycles
the garimperios gold.

66
00:09:09,912 --> 00:09:13,041
It buys it for 13,000 euros a kilo
in the jungle

67
00:09:13,329 --> 00:09:15,752
and sells it for 20,000
in Switzerland.

68
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:18,256
The illegals' money launderer!

69
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:28,005
The mine's 30 minutes from
the Brazilian border by chopper.

70
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,084
I first wanted to hit them
at the airport in Cayenne,

71
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:35,007
but the police would've got us
in no time.

72
00:09:35,248 --> 00:09:38,206
Now we'll be in Rio
before they realize.

73
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:41,956
The main quality of gold is,
it isn't traceable

74
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,376
once it's been melted down.

75
00:09:44,748 --> 00:09:46,967
2 hours after we get the gold,

76
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:50,586
we'll have the paperwork
and can dance a samba...

77
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,421
With 120 kilos each.

78
00:09:54,832 --> 00:09:56,505
What about the equipment?

79
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:58,334
It's being dealt with.

80
00:09:58,624 --> 00:09:59,921
How many people?

81
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,209
With Lionel, 5.

82
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,801
120 kilos of gold,

83
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:06,380
what's that worth?

84
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,673
Just over 2 million euros.

85
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,255
Each!

86
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:19,128
Good wine!

87
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:29,883
Virgil to Lionel come in, Lionel.

88
00:10:30,043 --> 00:10:30,965
Roger.

89
00:10:31,127 --> 00:10:33,095
We're all here except you.

90
00:10:33,252 --> 00:10:37,007
I got something to do first,
but don't worry, I'm coming.

91
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:13,639
Listen......

92
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,515
You're going to Paris tomorrow.

93
00:11:16,838 --> 00:11:18,340
Wait for my call.

94
00:11:31,672 --> 00:11:34,846
She mustn't work.
How many times must I tell you?

95
00:11:37,257 --> 00:11:38,759
She's pregnant.

96
00:12:35,552 --> 00:12:37,350
Beat it!

97
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,143
NO, Camille!

98
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,765
Camille!

99
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:50,365
What do you want?

100
00:16:51,281 --> 00:16:52,783
To say goodbye.

101
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:34,167
I'm sorry.

102
00:17:34,367 --> 00:17:37,166
Canadian Gold offers
better guarantees.

103
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,793
We applied first.

104
00:17:44,535 --> 00:17:47,584
How can you work such a big area?

105
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,415
I'll find a way.

106
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:53,708
The police say that last month,

107
00:17:53,868 --> 00:17:57,418
you took an injured illegal
to the hospital.

108
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:58,871
A 15-year-old kid.

109
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,540
He had a broken arm.
He came to us, asking for help.

110
00:18:03,327 --> 00:18:05,000
What should I have done?

111
00:18:05,286 --> 00:18:06,959
Let it go gangrenous?

112
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:10,119
You're suspected
of fraternizing with illegals.

113
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:11,545
What?

114
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,622
Are you shitting me?

115
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:15,710
They just killed my husband.

116
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,328
I have no choice
but to cancel your permit.

117
00:18:19,495 --> 00:18:21,589
In the circumstances...

118
00:18:21,745 --> 00:18:22,837
I'm sorry.

119
00:18:23,788 --> 00:18:26,041
You're stealing my concession.

120
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,547
I know it's hard for you.

121
00:18:28,704 --> 00:18:31,298
But please watch what you say.

122
00:18:33,538 --> 00:18:35,711
Do you realize what you're doing?

123
00:18:35,872 --> 00:18:37,624
I'm up to my neck in debt.

124
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:39,257
It's all I had left.

125
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:42,424
Maybe I could get you a job
at city hall.

126
00:18:48,706 --> 00:18:51,505
That's all very well,
but the gold won't wait.

127
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:53,884
And the guy
who got the equipment?

128
00:18:54,081 --> 00:18:56,175
Maurice? I don't think so.

129
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,000
He has too much to lose.

130
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:01,623
I can get you a pro within 48 hours

131
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,168
if I make a few phone calls.

132
00:19:04,582 --> 00:19:08,541
We can't wait that long. They
move the gold in the next 3 days.

133
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:10,960
They've already moved the rest.

134
00:19:11,457 --> 00:19:12,629
Gotta do it sooner.

135
00:19:13,332 --> 00:19:14,504
Or we forget it.

136
00:19:14,707 --> 00:19:17,005
We'll never get a chance like it.

137
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,926
I'll replace Lionel.

138
00:19:30,626 --> 00:19:31,752
Why are you here?

139
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,428
Canadian Gold stole our concession.

140
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:37,592
They got the garimpeiros
to attack us.

141
00:19:38,334 --> 00:19:40,803
Hey, Virgil, what's going on?

142
00:19:40,959 --> 00:19:42,927
Who is this?

143
00:19:44,835 --> 00:19:46,428
Lionel's wife.

144
00:19:49,835 --> 00:19:51,428
She gets his share.

145
00:19:52,502 --> 00:19:53,628
Shut up!

146
00:19:56,961 --> 00:19:58,304
There's 5 of us now.

147
00:22:41,223 --> 00:22:42,600
Aren't you on vacation?

148
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,607
I took a day off.

149
00:22:45,432 --> 00:22:46,558
I had a date.

150
00:22:47,724 --> 00:22:49,271
Was she pretty?

151
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:51,935
- Tell us.
- Later.

152
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:16,603
You're here, take it.

153
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,906
It ain't the South of France!

154
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:05,482
Why did you hole up there, anyway?

155
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:10,280
I wanted to buy a hotel in Morocco,
but that's too gay!

156
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:15,109
Well, right now you're supposed
to be a Swiss banker.

157
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,194
Thanks.

158
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:19,197
Beer?

159
00:24:19,356 --> 00:24:20,573
2.

160
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:34,871
What're you doing here?

161
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,197
I've come to do business.

162
00:25:47,404 --> 00:25:49,247
I brought you a buyer.

163
00:25:50,612 --> 00:25:53,661
How'd you like
to make some money?

164
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,531
Shoot

165
00:26:10,989 --> 00:26:12,161
How are things?

166
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,744
Whenever I supply gas,

167
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,412
I take a load back.

168
00:27:00,868 --> 00:27:02,120
Wanna buy my gold?

169
00:27:02,368 --> 00:27:04,837
It's safer and costs less
in transport.

170
00:27:04,993 --> 00:27:08,042
I bet I can make you a better deal.

171
00:27:08,202 --> 00:27:10,546
Maybe I already have a better deal!

172
00:27:11,536 --> 00:27:14,210
This is Mr Ziegler who came here

173
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:16,838
in person to make you an offer.

174
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:20,705
- Where you from?
- Zurich.

175
00:27:20,953 --> 00:27:24,287
I already do a lot of business
in Brazil.

176
00:27:25,787 --> 00:27:27,255
How much will you pay?

177
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:29,456
Well, the official rate.

178
00:27:30,412 --> 00:27:31,755
My gold isn't.

179
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:34,748
It could be. That's my job.

180
00:27:38,163 --> 00:27:38,914
What quantity?

181
00:27:39,621 --> 00:27:41,589
As much as you can get.

182
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:43,839
I should ask you that.

183
00:27:49,496 --> 00:27:51,294
Why should I trust you?

184
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,340
'Cause you know me.

185
00:28:07,457 --> 00:28:08,333
They're here.

186
00:28:58,711 --> 00:29:00,554
Be back on Tuesday with gas.

187
00:29:01,586 --> 00:29:03,463
Think it over in the meantime.

188
00:29:03,669 --> 00:29:05,091
Interested in gold now?

189
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:11,759
I want to be rich.

190
00:29:12,712 --> 00:29:14,555
You're not cut out for it.

191
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:17,056
You just want the thrill.

192
00:29:17,462 --> 00:29:18,839
Why do I work with you?

193
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:34,469
Don't turn around.

194
00:29:35,338 --> 00:29:37,636
Should I have used a Swiss accent?

195
00:30:11,966 --> 00:30:12,967
St Laurent,

196
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:15,472
this is Melchior.

197
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,802
Go ahead, Melchior.

198
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:25,810
Are the quads there?

199
00:30:25,967 --> 00:30:27,344
Yes, I just saw them.

200
00:30:27,883 --> 00:30:29,931
You should check the delivery.

201
00:30:31,218 --> 00:30:32,811
OK, I'll do that.

202
00:31:12,471 --> 00:31:13,518
Feel free to help!

203
00:31:24,347 --> 00:31:26,349
What's the dumb bitch up to?

204
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:28,185
No idea.

205
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,607
Mina......

206
00:31:56,265 --> 00:31:57,858
It's me.

207
00:32:01,432 --> 00:32:02,729
It's me.

208
00:32:06,183 --> 00:32:08,151
I say we leave her.

209
00:32:17,684 --> 00:32:18,731
Let's go.

210
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:36,978
We've been hit.

211
00:32:37,143 --> 00:32:39,646
Come in, Melchior.
We've been hit!

212
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:43,605
Look out!

213
00:32:57,812 --> 00:32:59,780
What the hell are you doing?

214
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,231
Don't wait for her!

215
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,859
They're firing at us!

216
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,522
Stabilize the chopper!

217
00:33:05,145 --> 00:33:06,237
Stabilize it!

218
00:33:16,188 --> 00:33:17,815
For fuck's sake, Virgil!

219
00:33:18,271 --> 00:33:19,443
Now?

220
00:33:19,605 --> 00:33:20,572
Wait.

221
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:23,739
We're gonna die!

222
00:33:27,022 --> 00:33:29,650
Virgil, now, dammit!

223
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,527
GO!

224
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,484
NOW!

225
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,527
We coulda been killed!

226
00:34:12,025 --> 00:34:14,448
You're crazy!
All that for some whore!

227
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:16,237
She worked for me.

228
00:34:16,401 --> 00:34:17,573
Calm down.

229
00:34:17,735 --> 00:34:19,328
We made it.

230
00:34:19,651 --> 00:34:22,450
I'm not so sure. We were hit.

231
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,988
We're too heavy to reach Brazil.

232
00:35:32,115 --> 00:35:33,537
You better explain.

233
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:35,038
Nothing to explain.

234
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:38,495
You shoulda let me
blow 'em up sooner.

235
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:48,121
Hands off, you whore!

236
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:49,247
Don't say that!

237
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:51,123
I'll say whatever I like!

238
00:35:52,658 --> 00:35:54,660
It's your fault we're in shit.

239
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,373
Don't go bustin' our balls!

240
00:35:58,283 --> 00:35:59,580
You got your guy killed...

241
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:01,035
Shut up!

242
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,457
Shut the fuck up!

243
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:05,956
Give that to me.

244
00:36:06,451 --> 00:36:07,623
Give it to me.

245
00:36:08,493 --> 00:36:09,415
Drop it.

246
00:36:27,578 --> 00:36:28,875
Scumbag!

247
00:36:31,411 --> 00:36:33,539
They must know we landed.

248
00:36:34,578 --> 00:36:36,080
We need another chopper.

249
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:43,214
Check if you have a signal.

250
00:36:44,996 --> 00:36:46,339
Check if you have a signal.

251
00:36:48,912 --> 00:36:49,959
NO.

252
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,422
They'll come for us.

253
00:36:56,538 --> 00:36:57,790
We gotta move.

254
00:36:58,205 --> 00:36:59,297
And fast.

255
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:01,583
There's just one small problem.

256
00:37:02,997 --> 00:37:05,216
600 kilos of gold.

257
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,879
Do we carry it on our backs?

258
00:37:11,873 --> 00:37:13,500
We'll make stretchers.

259
00:38:01,335 --> 00:38:03,258
We won't make it.

260
00:38:15,794 --> 00:38:16,966
She's right.

261
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,300
We're going too slow.

262
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:22,712
And we're leaving very clear tracks.

263
00:38:23,711 --> 00:38:26,134
OK, there's only one thing for it.

264
00:38:26,795 --> 00:38:28,422
Gotta bury it.

265
00:38:30,004 --> 00:38:31,096
Bullshit!

266
00:38:31,254 --> 00:38:33,006
We'll get it later.

267
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,593
I don't like the idea of...

268
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:38,837
Going empty-handed.
What if we can't come back?

269
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:41,511
We don't have to bury it all.

270
00:38:42,838 --> 00:38:44,590
Yeah, OK.

271
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:48,300
We each take what we can carry:
20 to 30 kilos.

272
00:38:48,588 --> 00:38:50,215
We bury the rest.

273
00:38:51,421 --> 00:38:52,638
The border is about

274
00:38:53,006 --> 00:38:54,178
60 kms away.

275
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:58,048
We rent a chopper in Brazil
and come back for the gold.

276
00:38:59,464 --> 00:39:01,262
Why only take 20 kilos?

277
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,845
We can take 30, 40 or 50 each!

278
00:39:04,006 --> 00:39:06,475
Up to you - you're carrying it.

279
00:39:59,052 --> 00:40:00,895
Goddam ants!

280
00:40:01,136 --> 00:40:02,308
Don't touch my share!

281
00:40:28,638 --> 00:40:29,890
Thank you.

282
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,681
Here's the coordinates.

283
00:40:34,846 --> 00:40:36,439
2 degrees north,

284
00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:37,973
33 minutes

285
00:40:38,305 --> 00:40:39,602
58 seconds.

286
00:40:39,847 --> 00:40:41,349
53 degrees west,

287
00:40:41,514 --> 00:40:42,982
48 minutes 10 seconds.

288
00:40:48,264 --> 00:40:50,858
If we go south,
we come to the Sapucai.

289
00:40:51,014 --> 00:40:52,982
We follow it to the sea.

290
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:47,647
Mining policy is bullshit now.

291
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,402
In South Africa,

292
00:41:50,227 --> 00:41:52,446
they go 3,000 meters underground.

293
00:41:52,602 --> 00:41:54,604
500 deaths a year. Know why?

294
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:58,481
'Cause the multinationals
dictate the conditions.

295
00:41:58,645 --> 00:41:59,646
Communist?

296
00:41:59,811 --> 00:42:02,360
No, geologist, but I know them.

297
00:42:03,186 --> 00:42:05,689
Truth is,
we've given up on the miners.

298
00:42:06,061 --> 00:42:09,440
When you're with armed men,
don't talk politics.

299
00:42:09,686 --> 00:42:11,279
You'll live longer!

300
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:15,526
The thousands of illegals

301
00:42:15,729 --> 00:42:17,948
in this jungle
all have radios.

302
00:42:18,104 --> 00:42:21,313
Right now, they all want us dead.

303
00:42:21,854 --> 00:42:25,154
They have better things to do
than chase us.

304
00:42:25,605 --> 00:42:28,438
They just want
to feed their families.

305
00:42:28,605 --> 00:42:29,982
Shut up and move.

306
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:31,990
Got a train to catch?

307
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,236
Know where you're going?

308
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,650
D'you want to do it?

309
00:45:49,828 --> 00:45:51,000
Shit!

310
00:46:09,455 --> 00:46:10,798
Fuck!

311
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:07,257
It bit me! Shit, it bit me!

312
00:47:22,585 --> 00:47:25,304
It's not dangerous.
He'll just have a fever.

313
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,843
- What if she's wrong?
- Then you'll die!

314
00:47:34,878 --> 00:47:35,970
The river!

315
00:47:59,338 --> 00:48:01,306
8 kms in 6 hours!

316
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:02,964
At this rate,

317
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,632
it'll take us a week!

318
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,382
What, then?

319
00:48:06,547 --> 00:48:08,140
Do we call a cab?

320
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,551
We let the current carry us along.

321
00:48:13,214 --> 00:48:16,559
I'm not doing that,
with all the crap in there.

322
00:48:16,756 --> 00:48:19,259
There's not more in there
than out here.

323
00:48:19,714 --> 00:48:21,387
Let's camp here.

324
00:48:22,174 --> 00:48:24,222
It'll be dark in 2 hours.

325
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:29,929
OK.

326
00:48:30,549 --> 00:48:31,846
We leave at dawn.

327
00:48:35,216 --> 00:48:37,184
You're right, let's go now

328
00:48:37,591 --> 00:48:40,310
before they catch up with us.

329
00:48:40,466 --> 00:48:41,433
Don't worry.

330
00:48:41,675 --> 00:48:43,928
Georges will make a safety zone.

331
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,385
You need to rest.

332
00:48:50,342 --> 00:48:51,810
I'll come with you.

333
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,390
I'll find us something to eat.

334
00:49:12,593 --> 00:49:14,436
You love it, too, don't you?

335
00:49:16,803 --> 00:49:20,012
The Wayanas call it
the flesh of God.

336
00:49:22,844 --> 00:49:24,061
Great!

337
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:28,847
Saints' halos,

338
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:30,556
Egyptian sarcophaguses,

339
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:33,018
Byzantine icons, statues of Buddha,

340
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,142
Inca temples...

341
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,188
Same in every civilization.

342
00:49:38,387 --> 00:49:41,015
The symbol of purity and perfection!

343
00:49:41,305 --> 00:49:43,808
I've heard that crap for 25 years!

344
00:49:45,971 --> 00:49:48,394
Gold is an alloy
of blood and sweat.

345
00:49:48,555 --> 00:49:50,523
This shit feeds on corpses.

346
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,308
It changes without any scruples.

347
00:49:54,056 --> 00:49:56,525
Gold teeth from the gas chambers

348
00:49:56,681 --> 00:49:58,524
became baby's bracelets,

349
00:49:58,681 --> 00:50:00,524
baptism medallions.

350
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:04,849
Or your wedding ring!

351
00:50:10,307 --> 00:50:12,355
Who said you could touch that?

352
00:50:17,390 --> 00:50:18,642
I'll give her some.

353
00:50:23,433 --> 00:50:24,810
What?

354
00:50:26,349 --> 00:50:28,397
Squandering your fortune?!

355
00:50:41,642 --> 00:50:42,985
What's she up to?

356
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:45,277
It repels mesquites.

357
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:46,768
Oh, yeah?

358
00:50:51,143 --> 00:50:53,441
Maybe we did her well to bring her!

359
00:50:59,519 --> 00:51:01,738
She can use the hammock in there.

360
00:51:08,436 --> 00:51:09,483
Thanks.

361
00:51:25,728 --> 00:51:27,275
The rafts are ready.

362
00:51:32,688 --> 00:51:34,315
What did I say?

363
00:51:41,647 --> 00:51:42,990
You keep watch first.

364
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,698
It's me.

365
00:51:59,065 --> 00:51:59,782
Here.

366
00:52:01,981 --> 00:52:02,903
Why give 'em to me?

367
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,817
So you can cut 'em up!

368
00:53:07,986 --> 00:53:09,533
Why did you wait for me?

369
00:53:13,029 --> 00:53:15,498
You'd be in Brazil now.

370
00:53:17,904 --> 00:53:19,622
I didn't wait for you.

371
00:53:19,987 --> 00:53:21,660
It takes time to take off.

372
00:53:24,154 --> 00:53:25,701
Thanks, all the same.

373
00:53:39,489 --> 00:53:42,368
He said he came to Guiana
because of you.

374
00:53:43,739 --> 00:53:44,740
Yeah.

375
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:50,114
There was a job
protecting the space center.

376
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:53,743
He stayed on
to look for gold.

377
00:53:54,157 --> 00:53:55,875
He found you.

378
00:54:00,115 --> 00:54:01,742
He did all that for you.

379
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,997
Who're you doing it for?

380
00:54:07,741 --> 00:54:08,867
For me.

381
00:54:09,658 --> 00:54:11,410
I don't believe you.

382
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,828
- It's true.
- It's not about the gold.

383
00:54:20,492 --> 00:54:22,244
Maybe I was bored, too.

384
00:54:22,409 --> 00:54:23,706
Yeah.

385
00:54:26,117 --> 00:54:28,370
I can believe that.

386
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:38,787
Are we gonna make it?

387
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,629
There's a price on our heads.

388
00:54:44,786 --> 00:54:47,130
There's plenty of bastards here.

389
00:54:48,203 --> 00:54:51,958
Usually they kill for a few grams,
so for 600 kilos...

390
00:54:53,911 --> 00:54:56,255
They'll come after us
for the reward.

391
00:54:57,454 --> 00:54:59,502
Not very optimistic!

392
00:55:02,162 --> 00:55:03,414
Shut up, dammit!

393
00:55:04,287 --> 00:55:06,085
Fuckin' jungle!

394
00:57:08,504 --> 00:57:11,508
We've reached the forbidden zone.

395
00:57:12,005 --> 00:57:15,885
It's a sanctuary to protect
the Indians. We can't go on.

396
00:57:16,339 --> 00:57:18,387
They stole 600 kilos of gold.

397
00:57:18,547 --> 00:57:20,390
I informed Paris.

398
00:57:20,797 --> 00:57:23,095
Down there is where it's happening.

399
00:57:26,173 --> 00:57:28,517
They have no chance of survival.

400
00:57:30,673 --> 00:57:33,631
If you can't find them, we will!

401
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,976
The gold! The fuckin' gold!

402
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:37,347
I can't see very well.

403
00:58:37,803 --> 00:58:39,225
Don't touch.

404
00:58:40,595 --> 00:58:41,812
What is it?

405
00:58:52,221 --> 00:58:53,268
What?

406
00:58:53,762 --> 00:58:57,107
You must've touched
an urticant plant.

407
00:58:57,472 --> 00:58:58,724
Is it serious?

408
00:59:10,098 --> 00:59:11,645
I can't see a thing!

409
00:59:12,973 --> 00:59:15,726
There were at least
30 kilos of gold!

410
00:59:16,806 --> 00:59:18,433
It'll be alright.

411
00:59:21,389 --> 00:59:22,936
It'll be alright...

412
00:59:27,474 --> 00:59:29,727
He'll go blind if he's not treated.

413
00:59:36,433 --> 00:59:38,561
What if we leave them the gold?

414
00:59:41,933 --> 00:59:43,276
It's not the gold!

415
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,772
It's that Indian!

416
00:59:45,391 --> 00:59:47,439
We should leave her here!

417
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:50,937
Ask your pals.
I bet they agree with me.

418
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:55,277
I'm sick of your shit.

419
00:59:55,476 --> 00:59:57,570
Now we do as I say!

420
01:00:09,768 --> 01:00:11,065
Who is it?

421
01:00:12,602 --> 01:00:13,478
Let me.

422
01:00:31,187 --> 01:00:32,484
Here.

423
01:01:33,524 --> 01:01:34,946
Shoulda let me do it.

424
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,697
They're just poachers.

425
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,487
Since when did you care
about being nasty?

426
01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:42,362
Shoulda killed 'em. They saw us.

427
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:44,493
They'll tell the garimpeiros.

428
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:46,868
They're not the problem.

429
01:01:47,735 --> 01:01:49,282
What do you mean?

430
01:01:49,568 --> 01:01:53,152
I mean
I used to work for mining groups.

431
01:01:53,401 --> 01:01:54,869
They're hard bastards.

432
01:01:55,401 --> 01:01:58,120
A gold mine
is a money-making machine.

433
01:01:58,693 --> 01:02:00,161
All in cash.

434
01:02:00,485 --> 01:02:02,408
Politicians, secret services...

435
01:02:02,777 --> 01:02:04,120
They all get a cut.

436
01:02:04,819 --> 01:02:06,537
We just stole some of it.

437
01:02:06,736 --> 01:02:09,489
They're gonna send in the pros.

438
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:14,323
A gold mine must be impregnable.
Now there's a precedent.

439
01:02:14,487 --> 01:02:17,411
You can't blame us
for a bunch of adventurers.

440
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:20,449
You don't command enough respect.

441
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,118
In South Africa,
we were never hit.

442
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:29,946
They know we use Melchior
to buy the illegals' gold.

443
01:02:30,154 --> 01:02:32,498
We can't risk that getting out.

444
01:02:32,904 --> 01:02:35,703
If they don't get out alive,
they won't talk.

445
01:04:39,205 --> 01:04:40,707
Yeah...

446
01:04:41,289 --> 01:04:43,041
I know this place.

447
01:04:44,123 --> 01:04:47,957
2 ethnologists lived here
with the Wayanas.

448
01:04:48,873 --> 01:04:51,672
I supplied them with fuel.

449
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:54,755
And that can help us, can it?

450
01:04:56,165 --> 01:04:57,417
Maybe.

451
01:04:59,707 --> 01:05:02,130
But what're we doing here?

452
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:07,218
There's a police barrage upstream.

453
01:05:07,666 --> 01:05:08,667
We didn't see it.

454
01:05:08,833 --> 01:05:11,302
Maybe the Indians ate them!

455
01:05:11,958 --> 01:05:13,460
What the hell is this?

456
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,043
What the hell is this?

457
01:05:18,875 --> 01:05:20,377
What's going on?

458
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:22,926
The river...

459
01:05:23,292 --> 01:05:24,965
It changed direction.

460
01:05:27,584 --> 01:05:28,881
The tide!

461
01:05:30,709 --> 01:05:33,053
The tide can make it
change direction.

462
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:37,384
I didn't think it could
so far from the shore.

463
01:05:37,543 --> 01:05:39,545
So, we've gone the wrong way?

464
01:05:40,293 --> 01:05:41,465
Yeah.

465
01:05:42,752 --> 01:05:44,550
We've gone upriver.

466
01:05:44,710 --> 01:05:46,462
The sea's the other way.

467
01:05:48,211 --> 01:05:50,885
If we go back,
we've wasted 2 days.

468
01:05:51,919 --> 01:05:55,549
You said yourself they're after us!
We have to carry on.

469
01:05:56,128 --> 01:05:58,506
To go where? The source?
Jerk!

470
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,514
It's every man for himself.

471
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:05,593
We stick together!

472
01:06:08,295 --> 01:06:11,595
What if we go our own way
and you get the gold?

473
01:06:11,795 --> 01:06:13,638
And forget to share it?

474
01:06:15,005 --> 01:06:16,382
Calling me a thief?

475
01:06:16,588 --> 01:06:19,137
Think about it.
It works both ways.

476
01:06:23,255 --> 01:06:25,223
You're wasting your breath.

477
01:06:25,422 --> 01:06:27,174
Who asked you, Ray Charles?

478
01:06:27,339 --> 01:06:29,512
You've had it, you hear? Had it!

479
01:06:34,381 --> 01:06:35,678
Maybe.

480
01:06:35,839 --> 01:06:37,216
But we go together.

481
01:06:37,506 --> 01:06:39,349
Let go of him, Enzo.

482
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:42,591
Let go of him.

483
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,183
Enzo, please.

484
01:06:54,549 --> 01:06:55,675
OK...

485
01:06:55,966 --> 01:06:58,014
I'll keep watch first.

486
01:07:20,510 --> 01:07:23,810
They went the wrong way.
They're going upstream.

487
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:55,647
I've been thinking.

488
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:59,186
If we ever get out
of this fuckin' mess,

489
01:08:59,683 --> 01:09:01,526
I'm quittin' all this shit.

490
01:09:03,058 --> 01:09:05,607
Anyway, I got nothing else to prove.

491
01:09:08,559 --> 01:09:10,277
Here, you should...

492
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:12,729
Come see me in the South of France.

493
01:09:15,268 --> 01:09:16,815
I'll do you a bourride.

494
01:09:16,976 --> 01:09:18,273
My specialty.

495
01:09:18,435 --> 01:09:20,233
It's damn good.

496
01:09:21,352 --> 01:09:22,274
You take...

497
01:09:35,228 --> 01:09:36,605
Fuckin' jungle...

498
01:10:25,815 --> 01:10:27,032
What're you doing?

499
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:28,407
I'm going after him.

500
01:10:28,565 --> 01:10:31,785
What're you talking about?
You can't see a thing.

501
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:33,408
You can help me.

502
01:10:34,274 --> 01:10:37,153
Don't worry,
the jungle will see to him.

503
01:10:37,316 --> 01:10:39,284
Our priority is to keep going.

504
01:10:39,775 --> 01:10:40,901
NO.

505
01:10:42,941 --> 01:10:44,739
The baby's due.

506
01:10:47,066 --> 01:10:48,192
Do what you like.

507
01:10:48,441 --> 01:10:49,943
I'm staying with her.

508
01:10:58,151 --> 01:10:59,403
Give me your phones.

509
01:10:59,567 --> 01:11:00,568
Mine's dead.

510
01:11:00,776 --> 01:11:02,198
Give it to me, anyway.

511
01:11:05,985 --> 01:11:07,612
Give me an hour.

512
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:56,539
Shit!

513
01:13:08,536 --> 01:13:09,753
Hello?

514
01:13:13,161 --> 01:13:14,083
Can't hear a thing!

515
01:13:14,577 --> 01:13:16,545
Maurice, it's Virgil.

516
01:13:16,995 --> 01:13:17,996
I need help.

517
01:13:18,162 --> 01:13:19,459
Forget it.

518
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,543
Its business, not charity.

519
01:13:21,703 --> 01:13:23,580
Everyone knows you did it.

520
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:26,998
10 k's of gold
for a chopper to Brazil.

521
01:13:27,162 --> 01:13:28,539
The cops questioned me.

522
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:30,547
I can't help you.

523
01:13:31,163 --> 01:13:32,506
Hurry up.

524
01:13:33,579 --> 01:13:36,002
If I lose the signal, I've had it.

525
01:13:38,496 --> 01:13:39,372
20 k's.

526
01:13:40,829 --> 01:13:41,625
Deal.

527
01:13:42,580 --> 01:13:43,331
Where are you?

528
01:13:43,497 --> 01:13:46,421
The inselberg
near the forbidden zone.

529
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:47,251
OK.

530
01:13:47,914 --> 01:13:49,291
I I'll be there at dawn.

531
01:13:49,664 --> 01:13:50,881
Alright.

532
01:14:04,706 --> 01:14:06,629
Where's the rest of the gold?

533
01:14:15,957 --> 01:14:17,300
Don't touch me!

534
01:14:43,418 --> 01:14:44,510
Enzo, it's me!

535
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:48,062
It's alright now.

536
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:22,018
I'll get Enzo.

537
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:24,730
I'll be right back.

538
01:21:13,781 --> 01:21:15,499
Try to sleep.

539
01:21:19,281 --> 01:21:21,079
I won't go without you.

540
01:22:00,534 --> 01:22:02,502
I was wrong about you.

541
01:22:04,618 --> 01:22:06,586
Is that a compliment?

542
01:22:08,243 --> 01:22:09,711
Just think...

543
01:22:25,578 --> 01:22:27,205
Carl I SSS?

544
01:22:27,953 --> 01:22:29,705
Don't worry.

545
01:22:30,537 --> 01:22:32,631
I know a good clinic in Rio.

546
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:35,914
I'll just take a look.

547
01:23:12,915 --> 01:23:14,792
Why did you wait for me?

548
01:23:16,790 --> 01:23:17,916
Go to sleep.

549
01:26:14,470 --> 01:26:15,767
There he is.

550
01:26:22,554 --> 01:26:23,851
Maurice sold us out.

551
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:24,808
Why?

552
01:26:24,971 --> 01:26:27,019
They're military choppers.

553
01:26:37,013 --> 01:26:38,390
Hide!

554
01:27:05,599 --> 01:27:08,352
That was reconnaissance.
They'll be back.

555
01:27:09,975 --> 01:27:13,434
If they sent choppers,
the commandos are on the river.

556
01:27:14,100 --> 01:27:15,397
SO?

557
01:27:18,225 --> 01:27:19,852
I stink of gangrene.

558
01:27:21,141 --> 01:27:22,814
If they hospitalize me,

559
01:27:22,976 --> 01:27:24,569
they might save my arm.

560
01:27:28,434 --> 01:27:30,937
We'll tell the police
we ' re garimpeiros.

561
01:27:31,809 --> 01:27:34,437
With the baby,
they might take us by canoe

562
01:27:34,642 --> 01:27:36,485
as far as Brazil!

563
01:27:39,102 --> 01:27:40,194
It might work.

564
01:27:40,435 --> 01:27:41,436
Come on.

565
01:27:50,353 --> 01:27:52,105
Why are you doing this?

566
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,480
I called them.

567
01:27:57,311 --> 01:27:59,029
They'll hunt me down.

568
01:27:59,978 --> 01:28:01,446
If they hunt me down,

569
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:03,738
they'll find you three.

570
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:14,982
I always thought
Lionel was a lucky man.

571
01:28:16,813 --> 01:28:18,861
You don't know me very well.

572
01:29:07,234 --> 01:29:08,531
Take them away.
