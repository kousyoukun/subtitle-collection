You've had quite a colorful
career as a student, Mr. McGraw.

94
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,885
You've managed to be suspended,
expelled, or physically thrown out of

95
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,721
16 colleges and universities
throughout the country.

You've changed your major 23 times.

97
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,978
And your presence has been tied directly

98
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:20,315
to three university presidents
losing their jobs,

99
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,401
two others being
committed to sanitariums,

100
00:07:23,485 --> 00:07:25,904
and at least one known suicide.

103

Mr. McGraw, as you are aware,

104
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,918
this university, our university

105
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:44,172
has the reputation as the single worst
educational institution in the country.

106
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,049
That's because it is the worst

107
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,565
educational institution
in the country, sir.

108
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:52,263
Do you realize
that not one single student,

109
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,238
including you, and them,

110
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,913
has ever won any award
for anything?

111
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,190
Not one ribbon, not one trophy.

112
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,651
In fact,
the only certifiable recognition

113
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,237
that any of our alumni
have ever received

114
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,949
is a parole.

115
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,246
Mr. McGraw,
every year for the past 15 years

116
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,373
the colleges and
universities of this country

117
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,709
have held an
intercollegiate raft race.

118
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:26,423
If just once we...

119
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,842
I mean you

120
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,761
could win this race for our school,

121
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,680
it would mean an end

122
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:36,270
to jokes like "Lobotomy U."

123
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:45,195
it would mean that
for the first time in our history...

124
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:49,694
Let me clarify my position,
so that you can understand.

125
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,490
A raft means a river,

126
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:55,493
and a river means rapids,

127
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:58,553
and rapids spells death.

128
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:00,376
You got the wrong guy!

129
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,632
Not so fast, McGraw!

130
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,335
Okay.

131
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,140
You've got the wrong guy.

132
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,216
Excuse me, Dean Burch.

133
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:13,261
Um, I think there's another point
that should be made.

134
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:14,971
I don't need this aggravation,

135
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:17,098
and this really
doesn't sound like a lot of fun.

136
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,850
I'm damned if I'll let my university

137
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,352
be the laughing stock
of this country any longer!

138
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:24,569
I want a victory with a capital "V"
and I want it now!

139
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:27,234
No more excuses!
No more holding back!

140
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:30,242
That's why I picked you.
And them!

141
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,113
You have the distinct honor of being

142
00:09:32,197 --> 00:09:34,945
the four worst students
in the entire country.

143
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,577
You are not
at the bottom of the list,

144
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,967
you are the bottom of the list!

145
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,583
That's why you're going to
win this race for me and Lepetomane.

146
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,634
You're the only men
who virtually have nothing left to lose!

147
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:48,777
Except my temper.

148

Mr. McGraw,

149
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,641
I'm not asking you
to do this for nothing.

the need to test me...

I suppose you know nothing

you've taken out
in 35 different names.

Or last semester's bookmaking
operation in the computer center.

wants to see me again.
