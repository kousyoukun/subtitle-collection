3
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:34,893
-  Stop right there.

4
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,992
Put your hands
where I can see them.

5
00:01:51,432 --> 00:01:54,217
Shirt off!

6
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,001
Come on!

7
00:02:04,009 --> 00:02:07,709
Pants off!
Come on, motherfucker.

8
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,842
<i>I always thought
my life would end like this,</i>

9
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:13,671
<i>in some godforsaken place,</i>

10
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:17,240
<i>from a bullet
I didn't see coming.</i>

11
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,373
<i>I just never thought I'd care.</i>

12
00:04:17,665 --> 00:04:20,145
<i>One thing
you don't want to see,</i>

13
00:04:20,145 --> 00:04:23,497
<i>me in a suit this early
in the morning.</i>

14
00:04:23,497 --> 00:04:25,412
<i>Means I'm working,</i>

15
00:04:25,412 --> 00:04:27,675
<i>which means someone is about</i>

16
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:30,155
<i>to depart
this life unexpectedly.</i>

17
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,621
- Stan.
-  <i>Yeah?</i>

18
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:02,361
- He's late.
-  <i>It's all right.</i>

19
00:05:02,361 --> 00:05:03,798
<i>He'll be there, okay?</i>

20
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:05,669
Hey, listen,
I can do the guy myself.

21
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:07,802
- He's there right now.
-  <i>No, no, no, no.</i>

22
00:05:07,802 --> 00:05:10,282
<i>Besides, I promised Bobby T
we'd give this kid a shot.</i>

23
00:05:10,282 --> 00:05:11,936
<i>Supposed to be pretty good
with a knife.</i>

24
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,069
Yeah, well that's what
you keep saying, but--

25
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,463
<i>Well, uh, call me
when it's done, okay?</i>

26
00:05:16,463 --> 00:05:18,465
- He's here.
- Hey, I got these for Rollo.

27
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:22,164
'Cause I-- I heard
he's a donut junkie.

28
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:23,687
So, I told him that he won

29
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:25,602
a dozen donuts
at our weekly raffle.

30
00:05:25,602 --> 00:05:27,996
He loves Boston creams.

31
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:30,085
W-- what's with the suit?

32
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:34,698
- What's with the shirt?
- Oh, it's part of the plan.

33
00:05:34,698 --> 00:05:36,091
I made it myself.

34
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:40,748
- That's pretty smart, right?
-  Yeah.

35
00:05:40,748 --> 00:05:43,620
Except Krispy Kremes are spelled
with two K's.

36
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:46,667
Who the fuck knows that?

37
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:47,972
Not you.

38
00:06:04,772 --> 00:06:08,253
Okay, make it quick.
You get one chance.

39
00:06:08,253 --> 00:06:10,342
You fuck it up,
he's in the wind again.

40
00:06:10,342 --> 00:06:11,822
Hey.

41
00:06:11,822 --> 00:06:13,650
Don't worry, old timer.

42
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,571
I got this shit.

43
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,588
- Trevor!

44
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:44,202
Yeah?

45
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,291
What is this?

46
00:06:47,728 --> 00:06:50,513
All right, man.
All right. Thanks.

47
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:52,994
See ya!

48
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:08,618
- That was Rollo.
- Yeah.

49
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:11,012
Why didn't you stab him?

50
00:07:11,012 --> 00:07:12,666
That's what I always do.

51
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,929
- Hence why they call you Blade.
- Yeah.

52
00:07:14,929 --> 00:07:17,714
- I thought I'd do
something different.
-  Mm-hmm?

53
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:20,630
I wanna show Stan some range
and imagination.

54
00:07:22,806 --> 00:07:24,982
What'd you do, poison him?

55
00:07:24,982 --> 00:07:27,028
- What the fuck?

56
00:07:27,028 --> 00:07:29,030
Boston cream, baby!

57
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:31,685
Woo!

58
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:33,077
Come on.

59
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,827
What did you put in the donut?

60
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:48,832
Uh, just, like,
a little blasting cap.

61
00:07:48,832 --> 00:07:50,617
Oh.

62
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:52,619
I mean, how's Beggar

63
00:07:52,619 --> 00:07:55,012
gonna know it's Rollo
without his head?

64
00:07:55,622 --> 00:07:57,014
- Well, there's like a--
- Shut the fuck up.

65
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:01,584
- Sweet Jesus.

66
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,804
- Benny.
-  <i>How'd it go?</i>

67
00:08:05,196 --> 00:08:08,069
Kid fed Rollo a donut
with a bomb in it.

68
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:10,680
- That sounds kinda cool.
-  Uh-huh.

69
00:08:12,856 --> 00:08:15,337
- Blew his head off.

70
00:08:15,337 --> 00:08:17,731
I mean-- uh,
Stan gonna shit himself.

71
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,385
<i>Hey, listen,
there's no need to bother Stan.</i>

72
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:22,083
<i>I'll take care of it.</i>

73
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:24,563
You know a guy
that knew Rollo, right?

74
00:08:24,563 --> 00:08:27,262
Find out if he had any family
around here, will ya?

75
00:08:27,262 --> 00:08:29,830
-  <i>All right.</i>

76
00:09:18,139 --> 00:09:19,836
Miss Kramer?

77
00:09:19,836 --> 00:09:22,709
- I'm sorry to disturb you.
- Rollo's dead.

78
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:26,147
- Yes.
- Whacked?

79
00:09:26,147 --> 00:09:28,715
As it were, yes.

80
00:09:28,715 --> 00:09:30,368
As it were.

81
00:09:31,543 --> 00:09:33,241
Well, thanks for the heads up.

82
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,243
I'll make sure to look up
that life insurance policy

83
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:36,723
he never got around to getting.

84
00:09:42,554 --> 00:09:45,296
I came here to discuss
a problem that's arisen.

85
00:09:46,384 --> 00:09:48,735
And if I'm not interested
in your problem?

86
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:49,953
Oh, well...

87
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,391
I see.

88
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:55,176
You'll slap duct tape
over my mouth

89
00:09:55,176 --> 00:09:57,308
and shove me in the trunk.

90
00:09:57,308 --> 00:09:59,310
Only if you're into
that kind of thing.

91
00:10:03,097 --> 00:10:04,968
Just wanna talk.

92
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,543
Wait in the car, Donut.

93
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:37,261
I'd offer you one,
but you just killed my ex.

94
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,481
You don't seem too upset.

95
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,049
I expected him to be deceased
long before today,

96
00:10:42,049 --> 00:10:44,181
given the business he was in.

97
00:10:44,181 --> 00:10:45,574
Huh.

98
00:10:47,663 --> 00:10:50,057
You have a thing
for dead animals, Miss Kramer?

99
00:10:50,057 --> 00:10:52,929
Marcie. I'm a taxidermist.

100
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:55,149
Mm. Don't find many of those.

101
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,541
It's a niche thing.

102
00:10:57,934 --> 00:10:59,240
He looks angry.

103
00:11:01,024 --> 00:11:04,419
Like someone stole his acorns
and he's gonna make 'em pay.

104
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,421
Really?

105
00:11:06,421 --> 00:11:08,858
I'm not up
on my beaver expressions.

106
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:11,905
- I could be wrong.
- I was going for indignant.

107
00:11:13,428 --> 00:11:15,212
Oh, yeah. I see it.

108
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:19,086
Don't ever mess
with my acorns.

109
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:28,835
I have a small problem,
Miss, uh--

110
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,967
- Marcie.
- Marcie.

111
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,926
I have to convince
a certain person

112
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:36,146
that the body in that trunk
out there is indeed Rollo.

113
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:38,192
Something happen to his face?

114
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:41,151
Yeah. It's missing.

115
00:11:41,151 --> 00:11:42,892
Along with the rest of his head.

116
00:11:44,154 --> 00:11:46,113
There's five grand in it for you

117
00:11:46,113 --> 00:11:49,203
if you come with me and vouch
that Rollo is indeed Rollo.

118
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,074
I could use the money.

119
00:11:51,074 --> 00:11:53,555
But I swore I'd never get back
into that world.

120
00:11:53,555 --> 00:11:56,819
So, I'll save you the dough
and myself some time.

121
00:11:56,819 --> 00:11:58,777
Brother's a tattoo artist.

122
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:01,432
Gave Rollo and I matching
tattoos as a wedding gift.

123
00:12:01,432 --> 00:12:04,348
- Oh.
- Our ass cheeks.

124
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,047
I had Rollo removed last year.

125
00:12:07,047 --> 00:12:09,136
Why'd you?

126
00:12:09,136 --> 00:12:10,702
Have him removed?

127
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:12,661
I don't know.

128
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,706
It's usually
along the lines of someone

129
00:12:14,706 --> 00:12:17,361
trying to fuck someone
else over, that type of thing.

130
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,494
That type of thing would be
on the top of Rollo's resume.

131
00:12:19,494 --> 00:12:21,235
Well, there you go now.

132
00:12:21,235 --> 00:12:23,454
Anyway, he-- he made it
back here to Biloxi

133
00:12:23,454 --> 00:12:26,066
and it just happens
to be my boss's territory.

134
00:12:26,066 --> 00:12:29,417
So, we're being courteous to
our colleagues in New Orleans.

135
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,028
I love how you guys
are so courteous.

136
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,902
Pop the trunk, Donut.

137
00:12:43,126 --> 00:12:44,606
Horrible drapes.

138
00:12:44,606 --> 00:12:46,477
Yeah, they went nice
with the kitchen.

139
00:12:49,611 --> 00:12:53,180
- That's Rollo's ass.
- See? Come on, man.

140
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,964
We didn't need his head,
after all.

141
00:12:54,964 --> 00:12:57,227
You got all pissy for nothing.

142
00:12:57,227 --> 00:13:00,056
- Why don't you...
- Oops.

143
00:13:00,056 --> 00:13:03,930
Bet you didn't know
Beggars and Rollo
were cellmates at Angola.

144
00:13:06,062 --> 00:13:08,847
Pretty sure he's seen
that tattoo up-close.

145
00:13:08,847 --> 00:13:10,849
Stan's not gonna
like this, Donut.

146
00:13:10,849 --> 00:13:13,069
- Stop calling me Donut!
- Okay.

147
00:13:13,069 --> 00:13:15,289
Get your gun out! Gun!

148
00:13:15,289 --> 00:13:16,420
Now.

149
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,206
Put it in the car.

150
00:13:21,295 --> 00:13:22,949
Fuck Stan.

151
00:13:22,949 --> 00:13:25,255
Beggar said I could come
work for him anytime.

152
00:13:25,255 --> 00:13:27,040
He's moving up.

153
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,085
And this'll prove
I'm ready for his crew.

154
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,572
If I ever hear anybody call me
Donut again,

155
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,096
I'm gonna come back
and I'm gonna gut you.

156
00:13:44,144 --> 00:13:46,320
- Old timer.

157
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:53,066
Don't call me Donut,
motherfucker!

158
00:13:55,329 --> 00:13:56,983
I don't believe I got your name.

159
00:13:58,245 --> 00:13:59,420
Charlie.

160
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,251
I'm moving up, baby!
I'm moving up!

161
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:06,035
Woo!

162
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:10,474
Ooh, sh--

163
00:14:14,826 --> 00:14:16,132
Oh, shit.

164
00:14:17,438 --> 00:14:19,527
Have you worked with him before?

165
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,572
No, first time.

166
00:14:24,793 --> 00:14:28,275
- What a mess.
- It's okay. The car is stolen.

167
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:31,191
I was referring to the kid.
Looks like he shot himself.

168
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:34,455
Well, he was
more of a knife guy.

169
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:41,288
Shit.

170
00:14:41,288 --> 00:14:42,506
Well...

171
00:14:44,204 --> 00:14:47,424
you know, they're kinda--

172
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:49,600
kinda the same size.

173
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,341
Maybe go visit your brother,

174
00:14:51,341 --> 00:14:54,866
the tattoo artist,
maybe he could, you know,

175
00:14:54,866 --> 00:14:56,564
kinda-- no?

176
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:04,006
Fine, but I'm not cutting
his head off.

177
00:15:49,051 --> 00:15:51,009
<i>Yeah, Scotty Porter</i>

178
00:15:51,009 --> 00:15:52,881
<i>looking a lot more
active out there.</i>

179
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,144
<i>He's really coming along,
that guy.</i>

180
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:57,712
- You put cilantro in here?
- No.

181
00:15:57,712 --> 00:16:02,325
Well, I distinctly taste lemon.

182
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:07,200
- Yeah. It's called lemon.
- I detest cilantro.

183
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,115
That's why I used lemon.

184
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,295
Did you-- did you get
this chicken at that Domenic's?

185
00:16:15,295 --> 00:16:19,473
Domenic's is in the North End.
We're in Biloxi.

186
00:16:20,648 --> 00:16:23,564
That's right, I don't know
what the heck's gotten into me.

187
00:16:23,564 --> 00:16:26,828
Anyway, the point is, it's
very good, don't get me wrong.

188
00:16:26,828 --> 00:16:29,309
It's very good,
even with the cilantro.

189
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,965
I think personally that
you should open a restaurant.

190
00:16:33,965 --> 00:16:37,273
Well, the only way to make money
in that business is to skim.

191
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:40,798
And you can't skim off yourself.

192
00:16:40,798 --> 00:16:43,540
No, well, I mean,
who in their right mind

193
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,368
goes into
the restaurant business?

194
00:16:45,368 --> 00:16:48,154
There's no money in--
in the restaurant business.

195
00:16:48,154 --> 00:16:49,981
None whatsoever.

196
00:16:49,981 --> 00:16:51,940
You know, you have to
divest yourself

197
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,289
of that notion, Charlie.

198
00:16:53,289 --> 00:16:54,725
- Uh-huh.
- What?

199
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,988
Watch the game, Stan.

200
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:01,079
<i>Stan Mullin, my boss.</i>

201
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,778
<i>He's run Biloxi for 47 years.</i>

202
00:17:04,866 --> 00:17:07,347
<i>Been a while since he started
forgetting things.</i>

203
00:17:07,347 --> 00:17:08,609
Okay.

204
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,001
<i>So, I took it upon myself</i>

205
00:17:10,001 --> 00:17:11,481
<i>to look out for him.</i>

206
00:17:11,481 --> 00:17:12,917
<i>I owed him that.</i>

207
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,093
I got you some fish oils!

208
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:17,574
Omega threes.

209
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:21,056
Good for your heart.

210
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:28,803
Leftovers are in the fridge
in case you're hungry later.

211
00:17:28,803 --> 00:17:31,153
Yeah.

212
00:17:31,153 --> 00:17:34,504
- Too bad about the kid.
- Yeah, it's a shame.

213
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:36,376
What were you thinking,

214
00:17:36,376 --> 00:17:40,075
letting a young kid like that
do a job like that?

215
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:41,337
I'm sorry, Stan.

216
00:17:42,338 --> 00:17:43,731
Won't let it happen again.

217
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:47,125
- We gonna have any trouble?
- No.

218
00:17:48,518 --> 00:17:49,867
I took care of it.

219
00:17:55,351 --> 00:17:58,398
- Sleep well.
- Thanks, partner.

220
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,712
<i>Beggar Mercado,</i>

221
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:54,758
<i>street thug
turned Ninth Ward crew chief.</i>

222
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,847
<i>One of the new breed of bosses</i>

223
00:18:56,847 --> 00:19:00,024
<i>cutting a swathe
through New Orleans.</i>

224
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:01,374
Let's see.

225
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,745
The guy who did him
got a little carried away.

226
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,011
Kid named Blade.
Maybe you know him.

227
00:19:31,491 --> 00:19:33,231
Don't ring a bell, baby.

228
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:36,452
And that's Rollo?

229
00:19:37,714 --> 00:19:38,933
It's him.

230
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:51,249
- Where'd you find him?
-  There you go, man.

231
00:19:51,249 --> 00:19:53,469
Rental,
near the airport.

232
00:19:53,469 --> 00:19:56,080
Got him?

233
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,865
With his ex's name on the lease.

234
00:19:57,865 --> 00:19:59,257
Dumb fuck.

235
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:13,271
- How's Stan?
- Still Stan.

236
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:15,752
I reached out to him
for a sit-down.

237
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,494
He didn't reach back, though.

238
00:20:18,494 --> 00:20:21,889
I got a lot of ideas
I know he'd like.

239
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:24,370
New construction,

240
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,285
new casinos, hotels.

241
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:28,896
Juicy territory.

242
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:34,945
You're his guy.
Make it happen.

243
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:38,906
We good?

244
00:21:15,116 --> 00:21:16,204
Ah.

245
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,816
First time Rollo's ever
contributed anything

246
00:21:19,816 --> 00:21:20,904
to this relationship.

247
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,297
Thanks.

248
00:21:24,604 --> 00:21:28,477
- By the way, why didn't you?
- What?

249
00:21:28,477 --> 00:21:31,654
Slap duct tape over my mouth,
put me next to Rollo?

250
00:21:31,654 --> 00:21:33,917
Not my style.

251
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:37,573
Besides, you dealt
with the situation straight up.

252
00:21:38,835 --> 00:21:41,359
- Don' t see that often.
- From a woman?

253
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,319
From anybody.

254
00:21:46,408 --> 00:21:47,583
Hey.

255
00:21:50,325 --> 00:21:51,979
You wanna get something to eat?

256
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:55,635
- Wow, where'd that come from?
- My mouth.

257
00:21:55,635 --> 00:21:57,854
Which appears to have
circumvented my brain,

258
00:21:57,854 --> 00:21:58,986
but there you have it.

259
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,294
- Why?

260
00:22:04,295 --> 00:22:06,820
- Celebrate.
- What, the dead guys?

261
00:22:08,735 --> 00:22:10,258
Problem solved.

262
00:22:10,258 --> 00:22:12,434
Situation avoided.

263
00:22:12,434 --> 00:22:13,870
Found money.

264
00:22:14,915 --> 00:22:16,046
You pick one.

265
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:23,924
- Mm. Phenomenal.
- Good.

266
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:26,361
Who'd have thunk you'd find
something this divine

267
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:28,450
at a place called Tuscan Tomato.

268
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:30,800
Well, the owner's from Treviso.

269
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,759
A guy named Claudio.

270
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:35,979
Not so good at English,
but fantastic chef.

271
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,981
What's-- what-- what's in this?

272
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,114
Malfatti,

273
00:22:40,114 --> 00:22:43,987
ricotta, flour
and, uh, blanched spinach.

274
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,859
And you know this how?

275
00:22:45,859 --> 00:22:48,296
Well, I just like
to cook, you know?

276
00:22:48,296 --> 00:22:50,559
That's kind of like
a hobby for me.

277
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,910
- But mostly Italian.
- Why Italian?

278
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,045
Well, when I was stationed
in Italy for a while there,

279
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,829
you know, I don't know.

280
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:02,440
I just fell in love
with the culture.

281
00:23:03,398 --> 00:23:05,269
Love everything Italian.

282
00:23:08,403 --> 00:23:09,839
Why taxidermy?

283
00:23:09,839 --> 00:23:12,625
All right.

284
00:23:12,625 --> 00:23:14,496
I like giving everlasting life

285
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:17,107
to something that didn't have
a fair chance at one.

286
00:23:17,107 --> 00:23:19,849
- Hmm.
- I restore their dignity.

287
00:23:19,849 --> 00:23:22,983
When I give
a hunter back his trophy,

288
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:25,420
I want that animal
to haunt his dreams.

289
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,727
That's an intriguing profession.

290
00:23:28,815 --> 00:23:31,818
No more than being
an enforcer for some mob.

291
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,171
- I'm not an enforcer.
- Muscle, then.

292
00:23:37,171 --> 00:23:39,739
Lot of guys
with more muscle than me.

293
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:42,002
All right.

294
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:43,830
A trigger man, button guy.

295
00:23:45,745 --> 00:23:49,531
I'm more like a, um, concierge.

296
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:51,620
- A fixer.
- Problem solver.

297
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,796
Mm. Like...

298
00:23:55,493 --> 00:23:58,148
I got a body with no head
that needs identifying.

299
00:23:59,193 --> 00:24:00,324
Exactly.

300
00:24:01,325 --> 00:24:02,805
And if I needed tickets

301
00:24:02,805 --> 00:24:04,764
on the 50-yard line
for a Saints game?

302
00:24:04,764 --> 00:24:06,592
Yeah, I could get those for you.

303
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:09,725
Who would you have
to kill to get 'em?

304
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:11,988
Mm, depends on
who they're playing.

305
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:14,208
Huh.

306
00:24:20,214 --> 00:24:22,999
Well, four stars
for the Tuscan Tomato.

307
00:24:24,653 --> 00:24:26,002
What do you think about...

308
00:24:28,657 --> 00:24:29,832
you know.

309
00:24:29,832 --> 00:24:31,791
Don't think so much, Charlie.

310
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,229
Stay in the moment. Enjoy it.

311
00:24:35,229 --> 00:24:36,491
The rest?

312
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:38,928
- Who knows?

313
00:24:54,204 --> 00:24:57,512
<i>Yeah.
What were you thinking,
Charlie?</i>

314
00:25:00,733 --> 00:25:05,563
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

315

Happy birthday, Stan.
Happy birthday.

Here we go now.
All right, Benny, there's yours.

325
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:40,642
- I'm on a fuckin' diet, Charlie.
- I don't know about that, Benny.

326
00:25:40,642 --> 00:25:43,427
That's not what Celine tells me.
Hoo-hoo!

327
00:25:43,427 --> 00:25:45,473
- All right.
-  Thank you, Charlie.

328
00:25:46,517 --> 00:25:47,867
Thank you.

<i>Stan hired him thinking</i>

336
00:26:14,937 --> 00:26:16,504
<i>he was Pauly Ice Pick
out of Boston.</i>

337
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:18,419
<i>When he found out he wasn't,</i>

338
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,987
<i>he couldn't bring himself
to send the kid packing.</i>

339
00:26:20,987 --> 00:26:23,032
<i>So, he made him his chauffeur.</i>

340
00:26:23,032 --> 00:26:25,121
<i>Tony D.</i>

341
00:26:25,121 --> 00:26:27,036
<i>No one knows

<i>Been one of us

- Moist.
- Winn Dixie.

349
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:50,233
So, this is what I merit now,
a store-bought birthday cake?

350
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:54,847
Yeah, those fancy bakery cakes.

351
00:26:54,847 --> 00:26:56,326
They look great.

352
00:26:58,111 --> 00:26:59,416
Taste like shit.

353
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:04,682
You go on home, Paul.

354
00:27:04,682 --> 00:27:06,815
- I'll finish up here.
- Thanks, Charlie.

355
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:08,599
If you're gonna stay
for the game,

356
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:10,688
don't forget
to give Stan his night pills.

357
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:12,342
Otherwise, he sleep walks.

358
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:14,431
Last week,
he almost walked into the pool.

359
00:27:14,431 --> 00:27:15,955
Later, Benny.

360
00:27:15,955 --> 00:27:17,260
You got it.

361
00:27:20,394 --> 00:27:22,004
Yeah.

362
00:27:22,004 --> 00:27:23,614
You know, I was thinking,

363
00:27:23,614 --> 00:27:25,834
uh, did you ever-- uh,

364
00:27:25,834 --> 00:27:28,576
did get one of those little,
uh, pretty fixer uppers?

365
00:27:28,576 --> 00:27:30,447
You know, where you used
to go all the time over there?

366
00:27:30,447 --> 00:27:31,753
All the time,
you'd go over there.

367
00:27:31,753 --> 00:27:34,495
- Italy.
- Italy. Yeah. Yeah.

368
00:27:34,495 --> 00:27:36,062
Yeah, no,
I'm-- I'm still searching.

369
00:27:36,062 --> 00:27:37,672
- What are you doing?
- I'm searching.

370
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:38,804
- I'm still looking.
- Oh, still search--

371
00:27:38,804 --> 00:27:40,457
fuck a bunch of searching.

372
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,503
Just do it.

373
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:44,461
I'm gonna
tell you something right now.

374
00:27:44,461 --> 00:27:47,464
In 20 years from now,

375
00:27:47,464 --> 00:27:51,164
you'll be much more disappointed
at the things you didn't do then

376
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:52,818
than the ones you did.

377
00:27:52,818 --> 00:27:54,863
Now, that's the only law
of the universe

378
00:27:54,863 --> 00:27:56,082
that's worth a shit.

379
00:27:56,082 --> 00:27:58,780
Well, there's a truth in that.

380
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:01,130
Look at me. I'm set.

381
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:03,045
I got a place
in Gulf Park

382
00:28:03,045 --> 00:28:06,527
I'm gonna spend my sunset days
watching them ponies.

383
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:07,963
Playing 'em during the day

384
00:28:07,963 --> 00:28:10,226
and some rum punches at night.

385
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:13,534
You know, now,
that sounds like a plan.

386
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:16,624
Plan, you want-- you want God
to laugh, you make a plan.

387
00:28:24,066 --> 00:28:26,460
- Beggar.
- Huh?

388
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,549
Beggar wants
a sit-down with you.

389
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,290
What does he want
a sit-down with me for?

390
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,335
He wants to run
some ideas by you.

391
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,033
What kind of ideas
might he have?

392
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:35,556
I don't know. I don't know.

393
00:28:35,556 --> 00:28:37,514
He said he reached out to you.

394
00:28:38,776 --> 00:28:41,257
Well, what,
does he got something?

395
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:42,519
Maybe.

396
00:28:45,261 --> 00:28:46,915
All right.

397
00:28:46,915 --> 00:28:49,222
I'll tell you what.
Go ahead and set it up.

398
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:52,529
I'm gonna sit him
right in front of me,

399
00:28:52,529 --> 00:28:55,576
this close, and I'll tell him
to go fuck himself.

400
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:58,187
See, here's the thing
that I did learn, though,

401
00:28:58,187 --> 00:29:00,450
that you don't wrestle
with a pig.

402
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:03,671
It'll get you dirty,
and he'll like it.

403
00:29:03,671 --> 00:29:04,846
Okay.

404
00:29:06,326 --> 00:29:07,414
All right.

405
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,505
Stay away from that bum.

406
00:31:23,985 --> 00:31:25,030
Easy, now.

407
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,121
You dumb fucks
ever heard of Ring doorbell?

408
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,211
Put the gun down.

409
00:31:33,951 --> 00:31:35,040
Get him.

410
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,567
- Go on. Get him. Pick him up.

411
00:31:49,967 --> 00:31:52,622
<i>You've reached Benny,
leave a message.</i>

412
00:31:52,622 --> 00:31:55,799
Hey, Benny,
we're under attack.

413
00:31:55,799 --> 00:31:57,410
Warn everyone at the casino.

414
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,283
Come on.

415
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:48,809
<i>Hi,
this is Stan Mullens.</i>

416
00:32:48,809 --> 00:32:50,506
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

421
00:34:34,784 --> 00:34:36,525
You like gulls, don't you?

422
00:34:36,525 --> 00:34:37,700
Sure do.

423
00:34:40,877 --> 00:34:42,705
Let's go check it out.

424
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,707
Why don't you
go feed the seagulls, huh?

425
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,361
Thanks.

426
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,320
Not too generous.

427
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:49,625
Let's go.

428
00:34:52,802 --> 00:34:54,935
I see you got
the granddaughter visiting.

429
00:34:58,895 --> 00:35:01,028
I assume
you want to kill Beggar.

430
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:05,554
You know I can't sanction that.

431
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:07,600
You sanctioned a hit on Stan.

432
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,905
No, I did not.

433
00:35:10,907 --> 00:35:12,866
That was a rogue move.
Nobody knew.

434
00:35:12,866 --> 00:35:14,302
Then, what's the issue?

435
00:35:14,302 --> 00:35:15,869
Beggar's an earner.

436
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:18,306
Funnels a lot of money
into the coffers.

437
00:35:18,306 --> 00:35:19,786
And to stay vital,

438
00:35:19,786 --> 00:35:21,701
you gotta change your way
of thinking.

439
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:23,616
Make room for the new guys.

440
00:35:23,616 --> 00:35:25,705
Stan was always fair with you.

441
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:27,402
Stan's gone.

442
00:35:27,402 --> 00:35:29,491
And you should be, too,
if you're smart.

443
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,277
I'm offering you that.

444
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:38,108
I've always had one rule, Sal.

445
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,112
Be good to the people
who were good to you.

446
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:44,637
Then be good
to yourself, Charlie,

447
00:35:44,637 --> 00:35:46,987
and get as far away from here
as you can.

448
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:50,599
Understand,

449
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:52,035
if you kill Beggar--

450
00:35:52,035 --> 00:35:55,474
Hey. I came here out of respect.

451
00:35:57,127 --> 00:35:58,955
You do what you have to do.

452
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:07,877
- What did Rollo have on Beggar?
- I don't know.

453
00:36:08,878 --> 00:36:11,707
But whatever it was
got him deceased.

454
00:36:11,707 --> 00:36:13,970
Where is he, Beggar?

455
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:16,059
Why don't you ask
one of your crew?

456
00:36:16,059 --> 00:36:17,191
I would.

457
00:36:18,323 --> 00:36:19,976
But they're all dead.

458
00:36:21,543 --> 00:36:22,805
You sure about that?

459
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:30,596
<i>All right, Benny,</i>

460
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:32,380
<i>there's yours,
here you go, Celine.</i>

461
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,164
<i>- Thanks, Charlie.
- You seen Blade?</i>

462
00:36:34,164 --> 00:36:35,818
<i>Hmm?</i>

463
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,299
<i>You seen Blade?</i>

464
00:36:38,299 --> 00:36:40,301
<i>Do I look
like his parole officer?</i>

465
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:13,029
Charlie Swift.

466
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:14,509
Uh, Celine.

467
00:37:17,251 --> 00:37:19,906
- Is Benny around?
- You just missed him.

468
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:22,909
He went to go meet
some guys over at the club.

469
00:37:27,783 --> 00:37:30,525
I was just gonna call him.
I'll tell him you stopped by.

470
00:37:49,718 --> 00:37:53,679
I always say goodbye
to him before work.

471
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,289
It's just our thing.

472
00:37:57,639 --> 00:38:00,555
Didn't say it today
for some reason.

473
00:38:06,779 --> 00:38:09,129
You tell him I meant to.

474
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,574
<i>Betrayal's a funny thing.</i>

475
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,405
<i>Its very nature
is to catch you unaware.</i>

476
00:38:24,405 --> 00:38:27,756
<i>This one was a gut punch
I never saw coming.</i>

477
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:32,631
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey, Giselle.

478
00:38:33,762 --> 00:38:36,243
You comin' over
after my shift tomorrow?

479
00:38:38,811 --> 00:38:40,465
I might have to
take a rain check.

480
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:42,771
I'll let you know.

481
00:38:49,604 --> 00:38:51,476
- Charlie.
- Milt.

482
00:38:52,868 --> 00:38:54,783
I thought
you were doing collections.

483
00:38:54,783 --> 00:38:57,351
- Not bouncer work.
-  Right, sit on it.

484
00:38:57,351 --> 00:39:00,267
- Place is under new management.
-  Come on, one more.

485
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:02,443
- Beggar's guys already move in?
-  Nice.

486
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:04,184
Soon as the lights came on.

487
00:39:04,184 --> 00:39:07,404
-  Ooh! Give me some shake!
- Like roaches.

488
00:39:07,404 --> 00:39:09,102
You moved in
with Esther, I hear.

489
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:11,452
I bet you she'd be glad
to see you come home

490
00:39:11,452 --> 00:39:12,671
early for supper.

491
00:39:12,671 --> 00:39:14,716
I'll bring her some wings.

492
00:39:14,716 --> 00:39:16,805
Maybe I'll get lucky.

493
00:39:16,805 --> 00:39:18,503
Don't forget to get a receipt.

494
00:39:22,115 --> 00:39:24,509
Yeah, that's it!

495
00:39:30,253 --> 00:39:31,994
That's it! Whoo!

496
00:39:46,574 --> 00:39:49,229
Charlie. No. No.

497
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:55,975
Charlie, Beggar said
Stan was finished here.

498
00:39:55,975 --> 00:39:57,585
He wasn't the same, Charlie.

499
00:39:57,585 --> 00:40:00,153
He wasn't
always right in the head.

500
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:01,676
You turned on your own.

501
00:40:01,676 --> 00:40:03,635
I had to
make a choice for myself.

502
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,854
Where's Beggar?

503
00:40:05,854 --> 00:40:08,335
He's been on the move
since this thing went down.

504
00:40:08,335 --> 00:40:11,468
Out of his fuckin' mind,
looking for whatever
that Rollo guy had on him.

505
00:40:11,468 --> 00:40:14,428
He's got the whole gang
looking for it.

506
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:16,473
You ought
to get out of Biloxi, Charlie.

507
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,434
That's what everyone
keeps telling me.

508
00:40:41,629 --> 00:40:45,111
Ooh, baby!

509
00:41:26,848 --> 00:41:28,241
Esther likes to eat late.

510
00:41:45,998 --> 00:41:47,390
Miss Kramer.

511
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,392
<i>Hello, Mr. Swift.</i>

512
00:41:49,392 --> 00:41:51,960
<i>Just calling to say thanks
for your lovely gift.</i>

513
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,223
I was hoping
to get him home for the weekend.

514
00:41:54,223 --> 00:41:56,704
I have a ferret

515
00:41:56,704 --> 00:42:00,186
and a white tailed eagle
ahead of yours,

516
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:03,058
<i>so your little friend's
gonna have to wait.</i>

517
00:42:03,058 --> 00:42:05,234
<i>By the way,
where'd you find him?</i>

518
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:09,108
Southeast corner
of Euclid and Grand.

519
00:42:09,108 --> 00:42:14,287
<i>- He got a name?</i>
- Uh-huh. Rocky.

520
00:42:14,287 --> 00:42:15,767
Original.

521
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:18,073
Well,
it's the Smith of raccoons.

522
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:23,078
I'm gonna need
a little more time with him,

523
00:42:23,078 --> 00:42:24,210
due to the tire marks.

524
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,560
Take your time.

525
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:31,870
- I just want the best for Rocky.
<i>- You got it.</i>

526
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:35,177

Guy was past his "sell by" date.

00:44:37,865 --> 00:44:40,128
<i>Tony,

533

534
00:44:43,610 --> 00:44:45,307
Fast Charlie.

535
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,832
I am impressed.

536

546
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:15,468
Men, I'm not so sure.

547
00:45:17,035 --> 00:45:21,213

what you're talking about.

562
00:46:32,197 --> 00:46:34,155
The fuck kinda bird is this?

563
00:46:35,504 --> 00:46:38,725
- Long billed woodcock.
- Yeah?

564
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:41,162
Girl, I got
a big ole woodcock on me.

565
00:46:41,162 --> 00:46:44,035
That's real clever,
for a 12-year-old.

566
00:46:47,473 --> 00:46:50,955
Can you put that down,
I've been working on it
for 30 hours already.

567
00:46:50,955 --> 00:46:53,435
What happened to him?
He got hit by a truck?

568
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,221
Some shithead
loaded it with birdshot.

569
00:46:57,526 --> 00:46:59,485
I don't see no birdshot.

570
00:46:59,485 --> 00:47:02,140
No? Look here.

571
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:03,228
Turn it over.

572
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:06,057
Right there.

573
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:46,706
This a bad time?

574
00:48:50,509 --> 00:48:52,032
Fucking Catholic.

575
00:48:55,601 --> 00:48:59,779
Now I see
why you like that old man car.

576
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,871
Rollo was here.

577
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,180
He showed up
about four days before you did.

578
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:12,183
Told me he'd give me 50 grand
if I would help him rent

579
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:15,534
a place to lay low
while he was working
some shakedown scheme.

580
00:49:15,534 --> 00:49:19,451
I told him the whole thing
was gonna blow up in his face,
and it did.

581
00:49:19,451 --> 00:49:20,582
Literally.

582
00:49:23,803 --> 00:49:24,934
What now?

583
00:49:24,934 --> 00:49:27,676
Well, I'm gonna dump these guys,

584
00:49:27,676 --> 00:49:31,115
then head to New Orleans,
Rollo's home turf.

585
00:49:31,115 --> 00:49:33,291
Pretty sure whatever
they're looking for is there.

586
00:49:33,291 --> 00:49:35,467
Probably
right next to my 50 grand.

587
00:49:35,467 --> 00:49:37,512
- I don't think
that's a good idea.
- Do you have a better idea?

588
00:49:37,512 --> 00:49:39,514
- What would you have me do?
Sit in some hotel room?
- I don't--

589
00:49:39,514 --> 00:49:41,299
Wait for you to tell me
the coast is clear?

590
00:49:41,299 --> 00:49:43,518
- What if you get killed first?
- Well--

591
00:49:43,518 --> 00:49:45,477
And then, I wake up one day,
and there's another
Mutt and Jeff

592
00:49:45,477 --> 00:49:47,392
at the foot of my bed
holding duct tape and 45s?

593
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:49,655
Besides, do you have
any idea where Rollo lived,

594
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:52,614
where he hung out,
the morons he rolled with?

595
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:56,096
I do. That 50 grand could really
change things for me.

596
00:49:56,096 --> 00:49:57,880
I'm gonna find it,
with or without you.

597
00:49:59,708 --> 00:50:00,883
Pack light.

598
00:50:46,015 --> 00:50:50,281
So, this 50 grand,

599
00:50:50,281 --> 00:50:53,675
what are you gonna do with it
if you find it, anyway?

600
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,503
LSU campus in Baton Rouge,

601
00:50:55,503 --> 00:50:57,331
they have
a Natural History Museum.

602
00:50:58,419 --> 00:51:00,769
Uh, they said
that they would like to hire me

603
00:51:00,769 --> 00:51:03,032
to be the director
of avian exhibits.

604
00:51:03,032 --> 00:51:06,079
- Hmm. Professor.
- No, not quite.

605
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:07,776
But they like my work.

606
00:51:07,776 --> 00:51:09,822
Said if I got certified,
the job was mine.

607
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,391
Twenty thousand

608
00:51:13,391 --> 00:51:15,131
five thousand
in moving expenses,

609
00:51:15,131 --> 00:51:17,003
and the rest
for a starter place.

610
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:21,964
Plus, a change of scenery
would be good for me.

611
00:51:23,444 --> 00:51:24,663
New start.

612
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,499
What about you?
You have any plans
when this is over?

613
00:51:37,545 --> 00:51:41,157
My line of work, it's best
not to have any long-term plans.

614
00:51:46,075 --> 00:51:47,599
You must think about something.

615
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:52,212
Mm-hmm.

618
00:52:36,343 --> 00:52:39,390
However,
it does have a kitchen.

619
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:46,135
- Mm?
- So good.

620
00:52:46,135 --> 00:52:48,964
Hmm. Yeah.

621
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:53,969
So, Beggar,

622
00:52:53,969 --> 00:52:56,798
he decides to make his move,
and he wipes everyone out.

623
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:58,452
You end up
being the last man standing?

624
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:02,717
Well, it would appear that way.

625
00:53:02,717 --> 00:53:04,371
Well, why didn't you run?

626
00:53:05,851 --> 00:53:10,943
Stan Mullen, my boss,
my friend of 33 years.

627
00:53:10,943 --> 00:53:13,554
A man who played by the rules,
kept his word,

628
00:53:13,554 --> 00:53:15,339
did well by people.

629
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:19,168
He deserved
to go out on his terms,

630
00:53:19,168 --> 00:53:20,431
only he didn't get to.

631
00:53:22,563 --> 00:53:23,956
Stan's dead, Charlie.

632
00:53:25,349 --> 00:53:27,133
Why does this mean
so much to you?

633
00:53:31,529 --> 00:53:32,965
When I was five,

634
00:53:34,314 --> 00:53:36,621
I'd wait at the door
for my pops to come home.

635
00:53:39,537 --> 00:53:41,843
My cowboy hat on,
my boots on, my gun on.

636
00:53:41,843 --> 00:53:44,324
He'd come in, I'd give him
a gun, and he'd say "draw."

637
00:53:44,324 --> 00:53:47,414
Now, obviously,
a 25, 26-year-old man's

638
00:53:47,414 --> 00:53:49,590
gonna beat a five-year-old kid
to the draw.

639
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:51,418
But what bothered me was...

640
00:53:53,202 --> 00:53:54,595
that every day...

641
00:53:56,205 --> 00:53:58,947
every single day,
he'd beat me to the draw.

642
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,429
He'd make me
put my hands up in the air,

643
00:54:02,429 --> 00:54:04,475
turn round and face the wall.

644
00:54:05,693 --> 00:54:07,347
Then he'd shoot me in the back.

645
00:54:10,785 --> 00:54:12,308
Every day, he did that.

646
00:54:16,356 --> 00:54:18,097
Then, one day,
I reared up and I said,

647
00:54:18,097 --> 00:54:19,838
you know, "What's
the sense of facing the wall

648
00:54:19,838 --> 00:54:21,492
if you're gonna
shoot me in the back?"

649
00:54:21,492 --> 00:54:23,058
And he said,
"Well, maybe today, I won't."

650
00:54:23,058 --> 00:54:24,582
So, I turn around,
face the wall, and...

651
00:54:26,627 --> 00:54:28,020
...shot me in the back.

652
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:33,765
Hated him.

653
00:54:37,682 --> 00:54:39,335
Now, one night...

654
00:54:39,335 --> 00:54:41,250
...one night, I tell this
to Stan, and he says,

655
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,470
"When he came home,
you should be waiting for him.

656
00:54:43,470 --> 00:54:45,385
Soon as he came in,
you should've been hiding

657
00:54:45,385 --> 00:54:48,301
behind the door,
and shot him in the back.

658
00:54:48,301 --> 00:54:52,087
I mean, fuck giving him a gun,
and fuck giving him a chance."

659
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:56,178
He says, "In life, you can play
by someone else's rules

660
00:54:56,178 --> 00:54:57,658
or you can play by your own.

661
00:54:57,658 --> 00:54:59,399
You play
by someone else's rules,

662
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,096
you're gonna
get fucked every time

663
00:55:01,096 --> 00:55:03,621
'cause it's their design,
not yours."

664
00:55:06,754 --> 00:55:09,061
My old man was just trying
to teach me a lesson.

665
00:55:11,977 --> 00:55:13,544
Stan got me to see that.

666
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:19,419
Hmm. Lifted the weight

667
00:55:19,419 --> 00:55:21,943

for 30 years.

668
00:56:17,129 --> 00:56:18,522

00:58:47,758 --> 00:58:50,761
<i>It's coming to terms
with letting go of the future</i>

699
00:58:50,761 --> 00:58:52,240
<i>that will never be.</i>

700
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:57,419
<i>- It stays with you.</i>

701
00:58:57,419 --> 00:58:59,508
<i>No matter how far
you run from it.</i>

702
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,002
You sure you wanna stay?

703
00:59:15,002 --> 00:59:17,091
I wanna finish
going through everything.

704
00:59:17,091 --> 00:59:19,615
Just the stuff he wouldn't
let me have when I took off.

705
00:59:19,615 --> 00:59:21,966
I'll take an Uber
back to your place.

706
00:59:27,711 --> 00:59:31,279
-  <i>AirLine Inn.</i>

707
00:59:31,279 --> 00:59:33,978
- Yes, good afternoon there.
<i>- Oh, good afternoon, sir.</i>

708
00:59:33,978 --> 00:59:36,502
My name is Mr. Kramer.
Yes, good afternoon to you.

709
00:59:36,502 --> 00:59:39,679
Listen, I'd like to check
on my room charges, please.

710
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:42,203
But I seem
to have misplaced my bill.

711
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:45,032
<i>If you'd like, I can send
a current bill up to your room.</i>

712
00:59:45,032 --> 00:59:47,382
<i>Oh, that would be
so much appreciated.</i>

713
00:59:47,382 --> 00:59:49,384
<i>Could you send
maintenance up there,</i>

714
00:59:49,384 --> 00:59:51,212
<i>please, check on my toilet?</i>

715
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,258
<i>You know, just keeps
running and running.</i>

716
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:55,956
<i>Of course. Room 704. Coming up.</i>

717
01:00:19,632 --> 01:00:21,199
Hey!

718
01:00:21,199 --> 01:00:23,027
Couldn't find anything.

719
01:00:23,027 --> 01:00:25,507
I tightened your valve.
Seems to be working, so...

720
01:00:25,507 --> 01:00:27,466
Thanks, man. Here you go.

721
01:00:27,466 --> 01:00:29,729
Damn thing kept me up all night.

722
01:00:30,817 --> 01:00:33,167
- Have a good day.
-  You got it.

723
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:49,678
Shit.

724
01:02:17,228 --> 01:02:19,317
<i>Attention, all hotel guests!</i>

725
01:02:19,317 --> 01:02:21,885
<i>There is an active shooter
in the hotel.</i>

726
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:23,277
<i>Please seek shelter.</i>

727
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,897
<i>Keep your room door locked
until further notice.</i>

728
01:02:40,425 --> 01:02:42,906
<i>There's an active shooter
in the hotel.</i>

729
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:47,998
<i>Keep your room door locked
until further notice.</i>

730
01:04:37,281 --> 01:04:39,196
- Charlie?
- Yeah.

731
01:04:43,069 --> 01:04:45,158
-  Jesus, Charlie.

732
01:04:45,158 --> 01:04:47,247
- What the hell happened?
- I got shot.

733
01:04:47,247 --> 01:04:49,467
- By who?
- Oh, some guy.

734
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:51,338
A guy?
A guy like you, you mean.

735
01:04:51,338 --> 01:04:55,081
Mm. This one was different.
Deluxe model.

736
01:04:56,604 --> 01:04:57,823
Beggar's number one.

737
01:04:59,433 --> 01:05:01,218
Could be you're in over
your head, Charlie.

738
01:05:01,218 --> 01:05:04,177
Been doing all right
up until today.

739
01:05:04,177 --> 01:05:06,658
Rollo was doing all right
'til he wasn't.

740
01:05:06,658 --> 01:05:08,834
Don't get any ideas

741
01:05:10,357 --> 01:05:13,143
about stuffing me
before I bleed to death.

742
01:05:13,143 --> 01:05:14,231
I wouldn't.

743
01:05:15,449 --> 01:05:16,711
No?

744
01:05:16,711 --> 01:05:18,017
Why not?

745
01:05:18,017 --> 01:05:20,237
I couldn't capture your essence.

746
01:05:20,237 --> 01:05:21,977
You capture
a raccoon's essence.

747
01:05:21,977 --> 01:05:23,762
You're an entirely
different creature.

748
01:05:23,762 --> 01:05:26,634
Hm. Well, that's for sure.

749
01:05:27,983 --> 01:05:30,073
Oh, for God sake's, Charlie. Here.

750
01:05:31,335 --> 01:05:34,338
You know,
you really oughta start thinking
about an exit plan.

751
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,384
A place to retire,

752
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:39,343
assuming you'll have a say
in the matter.

753
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:45,523
I was thinking about
buying one of these.

754
01:05:45,523 --> 01:05:46,698
Hmm.

755
01:05:46,698 --> 01:05:48,874
They go for a dollar.

756
01:05:48,874 --> 01:05:51,572
Of course, you only have to
promise that you'll fix them up.

757
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,923
But, you know, it's beautiful.

758
01:05:57,752 --> 01:05:58,840
This one's in Umbria.

759
01:06:00,103 --> 01:06:03,541
I mean, you can find these
all over Italy.

760
01:06:03,541 --> 01:06:06,587
- How long you been looking?
- Couple of years.

761
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:09,721
Well, what are you waiting for?
For them to go down to 50 cents?

762
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:13,725
It's a beautiful dream, Charlie.

763
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:17,772
You oughta go for it.

764
01:06:19,861 --> 01:06:21,080
Hmm.

765
01:06:25,519 --> 01:06:26,564
Yeah.

766
01:06:27,826 --> 01:06:29,697
I heard that
somewhere before once.

767
01:06:50,109 --> 01:06:52,198
-  What's funny?

768
01:06:53,678 --> 01:06:57,072
Rollo's got a price on his head
and is running for his life.

769
01:06:57,072 --> 01:07:00,467
Still, he calls his mama
three times from the hotel.

770
01:07:09,041 --> 01:07:13,219
Well,
if it isn't "Ms. Whores R Us."

771
01:07:16,048 --> 01:07:18,268
- Who the fuck are you?
- He's a friend of Rollo's.

772
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:20,792
Doesn't look like
any of his friends.

773
01:07:20,792 --> 01:07:23,273
Any come by recently?

774
01:07:23,273 --> 01:07:26,885
You claimin' I entertain
my son's friends here
for a small fee?

775
01:07:26,885 --> 01:07:30,715
- There's a shed out back
he uses as his man cave.
- Don't you touch his shit!

776
01:07:31,585 --> 01:07:33,413
All right. Where is it?

777
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:35,720
- What?
- The lockbox.

778
01:07:35,720 --> 01:07:38,766
Probably up your gaping asshole,
son stealer.

779
01:08:09,667 --> 01:08:12,800
That ain't your property,
you testicle sucker.

780
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:14,715
What's in it,
he promised to me.

781
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:17,327
If he wanted you to have it,

782
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:19,067
he'd have shoved it
up your cooch.

783
01:08:19,067 --> 01:08:21,418
Lord knows it's big enough.

784
01:08:21,418 --> 01:08:23,028
Remember my wedding day, Mavis?

785
01:08:24,116 --> 01:08:26,074
You were running around
with a Budweiser in one hand

786
01:08:26,074 --> 01:08:28,076
and your Uncle Fred's dick
in the other.

787
01:08:30,470 --> 01:08:35,301
July 29, seven, two, nine.

788
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:43,309
What'd you expect
to find in there?

789
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:47,400
50 grand?
In unmarked 20s and 50s?

790
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,533
- Where is it?
- You're looking at it.

791
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:55,103
25K each.

792
01:08:55,103 --> 01:08:56,931
- Double Ds.
-  Oh, God.

793
01:08:56,931 --> 01:09:00,500
Nipples the size
of silver dollars now.

794
01:09:25,177 --> 01:09:27,092
I'm sorry about your 50K.

795
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:29,790
Yeah, well, it was a long shot
from the get-go.

796
01:09:31,270 --> 01:09:33,141
At least your disc
is still out there somewhere.

797
01:09:33,141 --> 01:09:34,926
- Mm-hmm.
- Mine turned
into a pair of double Ds.

798
01:09:34,926 --> 01:09:38,277
Sure did.

799
01:09:38,277 --> 01:09:41,585
Augh, I should've slammed
the door in his face
the moment I saw him.

800
01:09:41,585 --> 01:09:43,804
You gotta wonder
what's wrong with me
that I didn't.

801
01:09:43,804 --> 01:09:45,676
It's hard to let go of hope.

802
01:09:48,853 --> 01:09:51,334
I gotta learn to let go
of a lot of things.

803
01:09:53,118 --> 01:09:56,034
Looks like the bus station's
just a few blocks.

804
01:09:56,034 --> 01:09:57,601
You can, uh, drop me there.

805
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:00,560
Yeah.

806
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:04,347
What you gonna do?

807
01:10:05,565 --> 01:10:06,653
Survive.

808
01:10:08,046 --> 01:10:10,918
We can either
make ourselves miserable
or make ourselves stronger.

809
01:10:10,918 --> 01:10:12,442
The amount of work is the same.

810
01:10:14,531 --> 01:10:16,097
You?

811
01:10:18,491 --> 01:10:20,798
Oh, I suppose I'll keep looking.

812
01:10:21,929 --> 01:10:25,106
- Why?
- I don't like loose ends.

813
01:10:25,106 --> 01:10:27,935
Ah. I hope they don't kill you
before you find it, then.

814
01:10:27,935 --> 01:10:30,677
Thank you.
I appreciate the sentiment.

815
01:10:34,551 --> 01:10:36,074
Oh, no.
I got it from here, Charlie.

816
01:10:36,074 --> 01:10:37,902
- It's a loan, okay?
- No, please don't.

817
01:10:37,902 --> 01:10:39,860
- Marcie, just--
- No. Look, a loan means

818
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:41,558
you're gonna be coming back
for me.

819
01:10:41,558 --> 01:10:43,429
And then I gotta wonder
if you made it or not.

820
01:10:43,429 --> 01:10:46,650
And then I gotta hope
you didn't change your mind.

821
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,481
- I can tell you
right now that I'll--
- Charlie, don't.

822
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:01,316
Here, it's just, uh,
just a couple blocks that way.

823
01:11:02,709 --> 01:11:03,797
Yeah.

824
01:11:12,850 --> 01:11:15,287
Look, you got something
you gotta do...

825
01:11:16,941 --> 01:11:18,769
and a lot can happen
between then and now.

826
01:11:18,769 --> 01:11:21,554
Let's just leave it here, okay?

827
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:27,560
Don't you be in love with me,
Charlie Swift.

828
01:11:31,477 --> 01:11:33,000
Too late.

829
01:11:54,631 --> 01:11:56,415
I know where your thing is.

830
01:11:58,461 --> 01:12:01,246
Beggar's bar.
Rollo used to manage it.

831
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:05,772
Last thing he said to me was
it's right under their noses.

832
01:12:07,295 --> 01:12:08,514
All right. Got it?

833
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,562
Where is he, Ronnie?
Where's that weasel?

834
01:12:12,562 --> 01:12:14,433
- I know he's hiding here somewhere.
- Marcie.

835
01:12:14,433 --> 01:12:16,783
-  Where is he hiding?
- Um, Rollo?

836
01:12:16,783 --> 01:12:19,003
- Marcie, Rollo's dea--
- You're a shitty liar.

837
01:12:19,003 --> 01:12:21,788
You always were.
You back there, Rollo?

838
01:12:21,788 --> 01:12:24,704
You pull a gun on me again,
and I'll shove it up your ass!

839
01:12:25,270 --> 01:12:27,228
Where are you hiding,
you piece of shit?

840
01:12:29,317 --> 01:12:32,190
You were sleeping up there? Huh?

841
01:12:33,800 --> 01:12:35,193
Come on, I got bills to pay!

842
01:12:37,717 --> 01:12:39,719
Come on!

843
01:12:39,719 --> 01:12:40,938
Face me, you coward!

844
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:07,878
If you see that cum stain,
you tell him

845
01:13:07,878 --> 01:13:10,010
he better give me my 50 grand,
or I'll cut his dick off.

846
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:13,361
- Wait, what's the rush, Marcie?
- I think Beggar's looking
for you.

847
01:13:13,361 --> 01:13:15,668
- Fuck off me!
- Won't you hang tight
while I give him a call?

848
01:13:15,668 --> 01:13:17,235
Let me go, you dick!

849
01:13:17,235 --> 01:13:19,237
Step away from the lady.

850
01:13:19,237 --> 01:13:21,674
- I don't see no lady here.

851
01:13:21,674 --> 01:13:24,372
-  Look again.

852
01:13:24,372 --> 01:13:26,200
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

853
01:13:26,200 --> 01:13:29,987
Hands, now, hands, hands.
Nice and easy. There you go.

854
01:13:29,987 --> 01:13:32,642
You go back to the safe house.

855
01:13:32,642 --> 01:13:34,469
I'll disable this crew.

856
01:13:35,470 --> 01:13:37,124
Yeah. Hold onto this for me.

857
01:13:40,214 --> 01:13:42,347
Nice and easy. Up.

858
01:13:42,347 --> 01:13:44,523
Get your ass up!

859
01:13:44,523 --> 01:13:46,177
Back up into the bar.

860
01:13:47,091 --> 01:13:49,572
Down. Get on your knees.
Get on your knees!

861
01:13:50,573 --> 01:13:54,359
Now, can any of you dumb fucks
count to ten?

862
01:13:54,359 --> 01:13:56,622
'Cause that's how many rounds
I have.

863
01:13:56,622 --> 01:13:58,711
Which means one of you

864
01:13:58,711 --> 01:14:00,583
might just get out of here alive.

865
01:14:00,583 --> 01:14:04,151
Only one that's gonna
get deceased is you.

866
01:14:06,501 --> 01:14:09,156
I'd do you right here,
let these fucking clowns
clean up the mess,

867
01:14:09,156 --> 01:14:12,420
but Beggar wants to feed you
to the gators himself.

868
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:15,336
Just you and him.

869
01:14:15,336 --> 01:14:17,295
He'll have a lot to chew on.

870
01:14:46,063 --> 01:14:47,717
You exclusive to Beggar?

871
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:53,374
Next exit.

872
01:15:54,392 --> 01:15:55,915
Is he dead?

873
01:15:55,915 --> 01:15:58,265
I'm calling the cops...

874
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,514
Come on, Marcie. Come on.

875
01:16:32,169 --> 01:16:34,649
<i>This is Marcie Kramer, taxidermist.</i>

876
01:16:34,649 --> 01:16:36,303
<i>- Please leave your message.</i>
- Shit.

877
01:16:41,526 --> 01:16:44,703
Yes, Marcie? Are you okay?

878
01:16:44,703 --> 01:16:47,097
<i>You just won't die, will you?</i>

879
01:16:48,011 --> 01:16:49,534
Your old dumping grounds.

880
01:16:50,578 --> 01:16:52,929
You got one hour
before I shoot her in the head.

881
01:16:56,976 --> 01:17:00,371
You piece of fucking shit.

882
01:17:31,010 --> 01:17:32,359
Stop right there!

883
01:17:38,148 --> 01:17:41,238
- Put your hands
where I can see them.

884
01:17:41,238 --> 01:17:44,807
<i>Always thought
my life would end like this.</i>

885
01:17:44,807 --> 01:17:47,679
<i>From a bullet
I didn't see coming.</i>

886
01:17:47,679 --> 01:17:49,289
Shirt off!

887
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,683
<i>I just never thought I'd care.</i>

888
01:17:51,683 --> 01:17:54,077
<i>Only, I did care.</i>

889
01:17:54,077 --> 01:17:56,731
I'm okay, Charlie. Don't worry.

890
01:18:00,823 --> 01:18:03,086
Pants off!

891
01:18:03,086 --> 01:18:04,652
Come on, motherfucker.

892
01:18:05,740 --> 01:18:07,960
<i>So, I was gonna
have to pull off a magic trick</i>

893
01:18:07,960 --> 01:18:10,267
<i>with nothing up my sleeve</i>

894
01:18:10,267 --> 01:18:12,443
<i>or down my pants.</i>

895
01:18:12,443 --> 01:18:14,749
Keep your hands up!

896
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,578
Turn around! Slow!

897
01:18:19,276 --> 01:18:20,973
<i>Impossible, right?</i>

898
01:18:24,847 --> 01:18:26,761
Okay, okay, okay. Take it easy.

899
01:18:26,761 --> 01:18:29,068
- Fifteen seconds to give me
that disc.

900
01:18:29,068 --> 01:18:30,983
<i>Think again.</i>

901
01:18:30,983 --> 01:18:32,811
- Her first.

902
01:18:32,811 --> 01:18:35,422
- The next one's in her neck.

903
01:18:35,422 --> 01:18:38,730
- Ten!
- I need to know she's okay.

904
01:18:50,785 --> 01:18:53,919
- What happened?
- Bitch didn't come quietly
when I asked her to.

905
01:18:55,878 --> 01:18:58,968
- You okay?
- Just give him the disc.

906
01:19:01,405 --> 01:19:05,409
I was thinking about the houses,
the fixer-uppers in Italy.

907
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:10,240
Why I didn't pull the trigger
on one.

908
01:19:12,416 --> 01:19:14,505
I was waiting for someone
to come with me.

909
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:18,117
You know,
didn't see the point in...

910
01:19:18,117 --> 01:19:21,294
living that kind of dream
all alone.

911
01:19:24,167 --> 01:19:26,343
You got five seconds, Romeo!

912
01:19:26,343 --> 01:19:29,346
You can have the disc.

913
01:19:29,346 --> 01:19:32,740
Only, there's a small problem.

914
01:19:34,090 --> 01:19:35,700
I ain't the one
with the problem.

915
01:19:35,700 --> 01:19:38,572
Yeah, you are.

916
01:19:38,572 --> 01:19:42,533

01:19:54,675 --> 01:19:56,068
<i>'til I'm the man.</i>

923
01:19:57,374 --> 01:19:59,463
I had to run it by Sal,

924
01:19:59,463 --> 01:20:01,944
make sure he was okay
with me killing you.

925
01:20:03,684 --> 01:20:05,077
Marcie?

926
01:20:06,861 --> 01:20:08,167
What's that on your shoe?

927
01:20:15,305 --> 01:20:17,263
Oh!

928
01:20:26,359 --> 01:20:28,274

01:22:25,957 --> 01:22:28,264
We were watching the game.
