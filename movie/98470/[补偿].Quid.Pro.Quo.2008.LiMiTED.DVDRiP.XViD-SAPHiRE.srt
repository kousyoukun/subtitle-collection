11
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:04,930
<i>That on the morning</i>

00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:06,932
<i>a high-speed</i>

<i>on a rural highway</i>
<i>in Upstate New York.</i>

14

<i>My mother died</i>
<i>on impact,</i>

<i>( dogs bark distantly )</i>

21
00:01:31,491 --> 00:01:33,492
<i>We were going</i>
<i>down a road.</i>

22
00:01:33,493 --> 00:01:37,730
<i>Nobody'd said</i>
<i>much of anything yet.</i>

23
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:41,266
<i>The road was supposed</i>
<i>to have been longer.</i>

24
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,140
<i>I did a story</i>
<i>a while back</i>
<i>about a kid who thought</i>

25
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:50,142
<i>something his father</i>
<i>had left him</i>

26
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,144
was magically
making him run faster.

27
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:54,546
He shows me the patch
and my first thought is,

28
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:56,548
it doesn't look
like magic.

29
00:01:56,549 --> 00:01:58,550
It's black.
The edges are frayed...

30
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:00,586
<i>( overlaps )</i>
<i>and I have to confess,</i>
<i>I thought I was</i>

31
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:05,457
<i>A little crazy myself.</i>
<i>But then I made</i>
<i>two discoveries.</i>

32
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:09,395
<i>The first</i>
<i>had to do with the way</i>
<i>people looked at me.</i>

33
00:02:09,396 --> 00:02:11,397
<i>I'd always gotten</i>
<i>the stares--</i>

34
00:02:11,398 --> 00:02:13,399
<i>You know, the ones</i>
<i>people give you,</i>

35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,201
<i>or avoid</i>
<i>giving you?</i>

36
00:02:16,202 --> 00:02:18,203
<i>But once in a while,</i>

37
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:20,973
<i>wheeling in and out</i>
<i>of the current</i>
<i>of people,</i>

38
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,709
<i>I'd catch someone</i>
<i>looking at me</i>

39
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,679
<i>And I'd see</i>
<i>something else</i>
<i>in their eyes--</i>

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,281
<i>Jealousy.</i>

41
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,283
<i>They were</i>
<i>jealous of me,</i>

42
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:35,821
<i>jealous that</i>
<i>I got to sit down</i>
<i>and they didn't.</i>

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,856
<i>Does that sound</i>
<i>crazy to you?</i>

44
00:02:37,857 --> 00:02:39,858
<i>Because the second</i>
<i>thing I found</i>

45
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:42,394
<i>was a pair</i>
<i>of magic shoes.</i>

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,636
<i>- ( knocks on door )</i>
<i>- But I'm ahead of myself.</i>

47
00:03:05,385 --> 00:03:07,386
<i>P.R.N.Y. is a small</i>
<i>operation.</i>

48
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:10,122
<i>The whole office</i>
<i>has to share one</i>
<i>production assistant.</i>

49
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,791
<i>But I got around that</i>
<i>by moving my desk</i>
<i>next to hers.</i>

50
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,094
<i>- WOMAN: Hey, I got you a date.</i>
- No, thanks.

51
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:18,864
Listen to me,
forget Raine.
Raine is over.

52
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,632
Charlene kicks
Raine's ass.

53
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,968
Is this Charlene A.B.?

54
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,070
Is she Able-Bodied?

55
00:03:25,071 --> 00:03:27,606
Yeah.
She's also H.B.--
Hot-Bodied.

56
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,609
<i>And she's a lawyer.</i>
<i>She's H.B.L.--</i>
<i>Hot-Bodied Lawyer.</i>

57
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,611
Hey, Isaac...

58
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:34,580
Does Charlene know
about the wheels?

59
00:03:34,581 --> 00:03:37,116
What, are you
Frankenstein?
You're hot.

60
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,320
Tonight.
I'm calling her
right now.

61
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:44,823
Last week a man
apparently walked
into Bayside Hospital

62
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,526
and bribed a doctor
into chopping off
his leg.

63
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,764
What was wrong
with his leg?

64
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,766
Nothing.

65
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:56,802
<i>It's weird.</i>
<i>I can't look away.</i>

66
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:58,804
It's the kind
of story I like.

67
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:01,840
But the caller has
a specific request.

68
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,776
Well, they always do.

69
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,611
She wants
to meet Isaac.

70
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,813
Lady, if they're
chopping off good legs

71
00:04:07,814 --> 00:04:09,415
for money,
that's hard news.

72
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,817
She wants
to meet Isaac.

73
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,053
This is my purview,
Edie.

74
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:15,921
I'll check it out.
If it's true,

75
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,589
if it really happened,
I'll call her back.

76
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:20,693
I know a guy
can find anything
on anybody.

77
00:04:20,694 --> 00:04:23,295
I also
know someone

78
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:26,031
in pathology
over there.

79
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,134
So call him,
see who gets
the story first.

80
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:31,403
<i>( car horns honking )</i>

81

ISAAC'S VOICE:
<i>A man walks into</i>
<i>a hospital</i>

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,456
<i>and asks a doctor</i>
<i>to chop off his leg.</i>

83
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:53,292
<i>The caller</i>
<i>who gave us this tip</i>
<i>left her email address--</i>

84
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,461
<i>"ancient chinese girl."</i>

85
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,330
<i>I know it all</i>
<i>sounded like some</i>
<i>elaborate joke.</i>

86
00:04:58,331 --> 00:05:00,833
<i>My contact at Bayside</i>
<i>was on duty</i>
<i>that night</i>

87
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,569
<i>and I was</i>
<i>half hoping she'd tell me</i>
<i>nothing had happened.</i>

88
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:05,804
Then the doctor came in
and the guy goes to him,

89
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,806
"I want you
to amputate
my left leg."

90
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,808
And the doctor
goes, "why?"

91
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,810
Sounds like
a joke, right?

92
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,881
So the guy goes,
"because I'll give you
$250,000 if you do."

93
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,990
Candy, no one will know
you're my source.

94
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:28,093
Nothing happened,
okay?

95
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:29,795
We said no
and the guy ran out--

96
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:31,630
like, literally ran.

97
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,332
Are you telling me

98
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:36,902
a first-year Resident
turned down a quarter
million dollars?

99
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:38,704
It's not easy
to cut off a leg,
you know.

100
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:40,639
It takes more
than two people.

101
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:44,410
Does this happen
a lot--

102
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:47,046
People coming
in complaining
they've got legs?

103
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,416
This guy was creepy,

104
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:52,084
said, uh...

105
00:05:52,085 --> 00:05:55,220
"I want a transtibial
amputation just below
my left knee,"

106
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:57,322
like he was ordering
off a menu or something,

107
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,592
like he knew exactly
what part was him and
what part wasn't,

108
00:06:00,593 --> 00:06:03,062
and the part that wasn't
he wanted gone.

109
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,136
Well, if any doctor
ever does take
the money,

110
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,738
call me.

111
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,618
Whoa whoa, Tommy.
Come on.

112
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:28,620
- It's okay.
- You gotta watch out.

113
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:30,556
Hey, it's okay.

00:19:10,583 --> 00:19:14,153
- ( beeps )
- Isaac.
Mind if I record?

302
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:17,122
<i>Why record me?</i>

303
00:19:21,528 --> 00:19:23,529
- ( beeps )
- Have you eaten lunch?

304
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:25,964
There's a great place
nearby.

305
00:19:25,965 --> 00:19:30,169
Really?
Um, well,

306
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,638
why don't we go
someplace neither of us
has ever been?

307
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,081
<i>( recorder beeps )</i>

308
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,687
( speaking chinese )

309
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,425
<i>( waitress speaks chinese )</i>

310
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:58,731
I thought you said
you'd never been here.

311
00:19:58,732 --> 00:20:00,733
I haven't.

312
00:20:00,734 --> 00:20:04,103
I love the culture.
I specialize in
Chinese art

313
00:20:04,104 --> 00:20:06,338
and Chinese ice cream.
Oh, man,

314
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:09,441
I recommend ginger.
It's very good.

315
00:20:09,442 --> 00:20:11,443
Now last night
they were talking

316
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:14,480
about someone
named Ginger Jake.
Is she Chinese?

317
00:20:14,481 --> 00:20:17,883
Uh, Jamaican,
I think.

318
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,554
What's the deal?
People go to her

319
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,357
to get paralyzed?

320
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:27,359
As I understand it,
yes.

321
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,361
What does she do
to them?

322
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:34,600
You know what, pal?

323
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:37,469
I'm not
the case study here.

324
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:40,506
Okay?
You talk first.

325
00:20:43,777 --> 00:20:46,178
What do you want
to know?

326
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:48,781
Tell me how you became
paralyzed.

327
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:55,688
I was eight.
My parents were driving.

328
00:20:55,689 --> 00:20:57,856
They died.
I lived.

329
00:20:57,857 --> 00:21:01,126
The other driver
was underage,

330
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:04,196
so the records
were sealed.

331
00:21:04,197 --> 00:21:06,198
I call her
"the pompom girl"

332
00:21:06,199 --> 00:21:09,034
Because I remember
seeing these pompoms.

333
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,840
Paralyzed
by a cheerleader.

334
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,277
Your turn.

335
00:21:20,213 --> 00:21:22,214
So talk about
your friend.

336
00:21:22,215 --> 00:21:25,651
What makes him
want to be like me?

337
00:21:28,188 --> 00:21:30,956
You know, I've never
talked about this
to anyone.

338
00:21:34,094 --> 00:21:37,229
So why do you think
someone would want
to be paralyzed

339
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,832
who isn't?
Give me your
working theory.

340
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,434
( chuckles )

341
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,870
I can't believe
I'm talking to you.

342
00:21:44,871 --> 00:21:47,773
- About this?
- Yes. No. Yes.

343
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,075
No no no no, I mean,
it's you, you know?

344
00:21:50,076 --> 00:21:52,077
I mean, you're, like,
the radio guy.

345
00:21:52,078 --> 00:21:55,347
Say whatever you want.
Whoever your friend is,

346
00:21:55,348 --> 00:21:57,683
they'll never know
I'm quoting you.

347
00:21:57,684 --> 00:22:01,286
Okay okay, um...

348
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:06,892
it's just--
it's harder than
I thought it would be.

349
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:08,894
- Why?
- Okay, all right,
all right.

350
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:11,697
Here's the deal,
all right?

351
00:22:11,698 --> 00:22:15,834
I want to know
why my friend wants
to be a paraplegic, okay?

352
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:19,838
So this
for me is all about
understanding you.

353
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,876
And, you know,
then I'll tell you
whatever you want.

354
00:22:23,877 --> 00:22:26,512
So, Quid Pro Quo.

355
00:22:26,513 --> 00:22:28,514
I want your life, pal,

356
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:32,484
as a paraplegic,
in detail.

357
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:35,621
You want my life?

358
00:22:35,622 --> 00:22:37,556
All right.

359
00:22:39,893 --> 00:22:43,095
At my work
I have this guy

360
00:22:43,096 --> 00:22:46,198
who hates me.

361
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:49,134
Because you're
paraplegic?

362
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:52,037
No, because
he's a dick.

363
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:56,041
I have one of those
at my job.

364
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,544
Where do you work?

365
00:22:58,545 --> 00:23:00,546
Um...

366
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,716
I'm a conservator.
I freelance.

367
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,918
Right now I'm doing
the new collection

368
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,887
- at the van Platt Museum.
- There you go.

369
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,889
I'm sure Al Qaeda
has someone

370
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:13,392
who comes to
the cave every morning
and somebody whispers,

371
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,661
"that guy has
no self-awareness
whatsoever."

372
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,563
Well, maybe he thinks
<i>you're a dick.</i>

373
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,999
No, he thinks
I'm a gimp.

374
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,035
What is that?
Is that, like,
a reporter thing

375
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:25,871
where later
you'll say,

376
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:27,973
"mentioned the word 'gimp'
and she laughs."

377
00:23:27,974 --> 00:23:30,309
- Yes.
- Yes?

378
00:23:30,310 --> 00:23:34,913
I'm painfully
aware, okay?
I'm too aware.

379
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:37,850
Well, then you know
I like you.

380
00:23:37,851 --> 00:23:39,985
Uh-oh, that means
you are weird.

381
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,187
No, I'm easy.
I like anybody
who likes me, so...

382
00:23:47,961 --> 00:23:50,996
Okay.

383
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:55,968
What if
I introduced you
to my friend?

384
00:23:57,637 --> 00:23:59,638
Then I'd like that.

385
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:03,308
Then the question is,
what will you
do for me?

386
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:06,378
Oh, right.
It's always Quid Pro Quo
with this girl.

387
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:10,215
<i>( lock rattles )</i>

388
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,526
<i>( clock ticking softly )</i>

389
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,612
<i>( soft squeaks )</i>

390
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,598
Don't touch
that vase.

391
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,533
It's worth more
than this building.

392
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,040
Offended?

393
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,308
I want
to know more.

394
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,446
You know how you have
apartment fantasies

395
00:25:47,447 --> 00:25:50,516
when you're
a teenager?

396
00:25:50,517 --> 00:25:52,518
<i>Mine was</i>
<i>to get a place</i>

397
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,520
so I could shut
the curtains all day

398
00:25:54,521 --> 00:25:57,790
and walk around
in my Milwaukee brace.

399
00:25:57,791 --> 00:25:59,792
<i>And you know what?</i>

400
00:25:59,793 --> 00:26:03,862
It's better than
I ever imagined.

401
00:26:03,863 --> 00:26:08,000
So this is
a sexual thing
for you mainly.

402
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,905
People who get off
on braces and wheelchairs

403
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,274
are called devotees.

404
00:26:15,275 --> 00:26:17,843
They're a joke.
They're the bottom rung.

405
00:26:17,844 --> 00:26:20,245
Above them are
the pretenders.

406
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,614
They wear the braces,
they push the wheels,

407
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:25,284
but they don't belong
to their chairs.

408
00:26:25,285 --> 00:26:27,286
Still, if they want
to fantasize,

409
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,421
that's their choice.

410
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:33,292
Then there are
the wannabes.

411
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:36,562
You saw how crazy
they are.

412
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:38,564
<i>What makes you</i>
<i>different</i>

413
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:42,034
<i>than a wannabe</i>
<i>or a pretender?</i>

414
00:26:42,035 --> 00:26:44,036
I'm a unique case.

415
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:47,106
<i>I don't want to be</i>
<i>paralyzed.</i>

416
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:49,274
You don't?

417
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:52,044
I already am
paralyzed.

418
00:26:52,045 --> 00:26:54,646
I'm just trapped
in a walking person's
body.

419
00:26:58,651 --> 00:27:01,320
( sighs deeply )

420
00:27:06,793 --> 00:27:09,028
You make me
so nervous.

421
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,831
The other day
I decided

422
00:27:12,832 --> 00:27:14,833
that nervousness
is shame

423
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:17,269
someone catches you
feeling.

424
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:20,105
<i>And I ask myself,</i>
<i>why am I ashamed?</i>

425
00:27:20,106 --> 00:27:22,107
And if you are,
why do you continue

426
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,043
<i>to do this?</i>

427
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:03,716
I can't.
I can't.

428
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:08,554
I guessed you were
a T12 or a T11
incomplete.

429
00:28:08,555 --> 00:28:10,656
- What was it,
a lumbar lesion?
- Not that.

430
00:28:10,657 --> 00:28:12,658
Listen, that's not
the problem.

431
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:14,660
I can have sex.

432
00:28:14,661 --> 00:28:16,962
The problem is,
there's someone else.

433
00:28:16,963 --> 00:28:18,964
Who?

434
00:28:18,965 --> 00:28:21,500
She's paraplegic.

435
00:28:24,304 --> 00:28:26,305
I don't know
why I just said that.

436
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:28,374
I don't describe people
by their injuries.

437
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,409
She's--
her name is Raine.

438
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,181
Is she
your girlfriend?

439
00:28:36,182 --> 00:28:38,484
Sort of.
I asked her
to marry me.

440
00:28:38,485 --> 00:28:40,986
I don't know
if that counts.

441
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:45,491
<i>She said no.</i>
<i>She has this idea</i>

442
00:28:45,492 --> 00:28:47,493
that one person
in every marriage

443
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:49,862
should be able
to walk.

444
00:28:49,863 --> 00:28:51,864
So that doesn't
really--

445
00:28:51,865 --> 00:28:54,199
that doesn't
really count.

446
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,336
This is good news.

447
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,042
I'm sure she'll
change her mind.

448
00:29:05,345 --> 00:29:07,546
I hope so.

449
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,648
And if she doesn't,
she's crazier
than I am,

450
00:29:09,649 --> 00:29:12,618
and how crazy is that?
( laughs )

451
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:14,620
It's not you, Fiona.

452
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:30,302
You probably think
I'd jump anything
in a wheelchair.

453
00:29:30,303 --> 00:29:32,971
No, I don't.
I'm just trying
to understand.

454
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:40,312
I've never shown
any of this

455
00:29:40,313 --> 00:29:42,981
to any living soul,
ever.

456
00:29:49,756 --> 00:29:52,591
There are
some things you're not
supposed to show.

457
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:59,631
Oh, well.

458
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:03,936
I don't have to go.
You can talk to me.

459
00:30:03,937 --> 00:30:06,438
I need to use
my chair right now

460
00:30:06,439 --> 00:30:08,240
and I can't do that
in front of you.

461
00:30:08,241 --> 00:30:10,075
You can trust me.

462
00:30:10,076 --> 00:30:12,478
I've been completely
honest with you.

463
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,955
Tomorrow I'm gonna use
my chair in public

464
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:24,957
for the first time

465
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:29,161
and you, pal,
are cordially invited.

466
00:30:29,162 --> 00:30:31,163
And now I want
to thank you

467
00:30:31,164 --> 00:30:35,701
for a wonderful,
so wonderful day.

468

480
00:31:44,371 --> 00:31:46,038
Oh, good shot.

481
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:53,712
<i>My friend Dave and I</i>

488
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,101
You haven't
mentioned Raine.

489
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:19,038
I haven't seen her
in six weeks.

490
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,008
Mm-hmm.
Did you two
have a fight?

491
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,843
Sort of.

492
00:32:24,844 --> 00:32:27,346
I asked her
to marry me.

493
00:32:27,347 --> 00:32:30,482
- What did she say?
- She broke up with me.

494
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:33,719
Apparently, I'm not
husband material.

495
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,789
You'll never guess why.

496
00:32:39,192 --> 00:32:42,161
You ever have
anyone confess

497
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:44,196
they wanted to be
an amputee

498
00:32:44,197 --> 00:32:46,131
or paralyzed?

499
00:32:51,905 --> 00:32:53,906
You'd be surprised
what some people

500
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:56,608
want to do
to themselves.

501
00:32:58,445 --> 00:33:01,513
I'm doing
this story...

502
00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:05,451
I can't discuss
what I hear in confession,

503
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,920
not even with you.

504
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,922
No, I wouldn't
presume--

505
00:33:09,923 --> 00:33:11,857
Uh-huh.

506
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:21,266
There's a lot
of mixed-up people
in this world.

507
00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:23,602
Raine is only
one of them.

508
00:33:23,603 --> 00:33:26,538
Um... Yes,
there he is.

509
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:28,474
Okay, thank you.

510
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,784
Thank you.

511
00:33:40,754 --> 00:33:42,021
Hi.

512
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:46,692
Whoo.
Are people staring?

513
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:48,594
I can't tell
if it's just me.

514
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:50,596
Probably
a little of both.

515
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:55,601
Yeah, well, this was
a good suggestion.

516
00:33:55,602 --> 00:33:58,537
Thank you.

517
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:05,744
Oh My God,
that woman is
staring at me.

518
00:34:07,847 --> 00:34:10,215
This is
an incredible feeling.

519
00:34:10,216 --> 00:34:13,819
Oh, God.
This is so incredible.

520
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,821
You know,
I have dreamed

521
00:34:15,822 --> 00:34:17,756
about this moment
for so long.

522
00:34:17,757 --> 00:34:21,894
It felt like 20 years
just to get a cab.

523
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:25,264
Welcome to hell.
I'll introduce you
to the staff.

524
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:28,000
I want you to stop me
if I'm doing anything
wrong, okay?

525
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:29,668
- You're doing fine.
<i>- No, seriously,</i>

526
00:34:29,669 --> 00:34:31,437
I want you to tell me
if there's anything

527
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,273
I should be
doing differently or
shouldn't be doing at all.

528
00:34:34,274 --> 00:34:36,275
<i>- Hi.</i>
- Hi.

529
00:34:36,276 --> 00:34:38,510
Fiona, this is--
this is Raine.

530
00:34:38,511 --> 00:34:41,313
- Who?
<i>- Raine.</i>

531
00:34:41,314 --> 00:34:44,216
<i>Oh. Oh!</i>

532
00:34:44,217 --> 00:34:46,118
- Hello.
- Hi!

533
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,786
Isaac has told me
so much about you.

534
00:34:47,787 --> 00:34:50,222
<i>He talks about you</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

535
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:52,858
This is my friend Fiona.

536
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:54,326
Hi.
I'm the ex.

537
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:56,195
- Hi.
- Apparently,
we haven't decided

538
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:58,464
who gets to keep
the restaurant yet.

539
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,499
<i>- Fiona: right.</i>
- Nice chair.

540
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,502
Thank you.
It's a good ride, eh?

541
00:35:04,571 --> 00:35:07,206
We were just leaving.

542
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:09,875
- Who was leaving?
- Oh, Scott and I.

543
00:35:09,876 --> 00:35:11,877
Who's Scott?

544
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:13,979
RAINE:
<i>Yeah, he's just</i>
<i>finishing.</i>

545
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:19,418
( quietly )
Hi, Scott.

546
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:25,424
Raine, you have
to help me.

547
00:35:25,425 --> 00:35:28,560
Isaac and I
were just talking
about flying to Nevis.

548
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:30,763
<i>It's a wonderful island.</i>
<i>Have you been?</i>

549
00:35:30,764 --> 00:35:34,033
- No, I haven't.
- Oh, well, he won't budge.

550
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:36,802
I really want
to get out of the city,
but he just won't do it.

551
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:38,804
Encourage him.

552
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:40,973
- What the hell,
you should do it.
<i>- He should.</i>

553
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:43,876
- Yeah, we'll see.
- Yeah, he won't budge.

554
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,348
<i>Raine, it's a real</i>
<i>pleasure to meet you</i>

555
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,950
Finally.

556
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,220
Good to meet you,
Fiona.

557
00:35:55,221 --> 00:35:57,022
It was good
to see you.

558
00:36:07,567 --> 00:36:09,902
Oh My God.

559
00:36:09,903 --> 00:36:11,904
Was I okay?

560
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:14,873
What?
I said something wrong,
didn't I?

561
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:17,209
You didn't
feel me kicking you
under the table?

562
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,080
No.

563
00:36:21,081 --> 00:36:23,482
Just hold on
one second.

564
00:36:28,922 --> 00:36:30,723
Raine!

565
00:38:03,183 --> 00:38:06,051
<i>( thunder rumbles,</i>
<i>rain pattering )</i>

<i>( knocks on door )</i>

567
00:38:39,719 --> 00:38:42,054
Hi.
You forgot this.

568
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:44,957
- I'm so sorry.
- Don't be.

569
00:38:44,958 --> 00:38:49,228
I've had the most
incredible day.

570
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,697
Same here.
Unbelievable.

571
00:38:51,698 --> 00:38:55,067
Isaac, I finally
stopped worrying
and just started being.

572
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:59,638
And I found out
that I can do anything.

573
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,640
Oops. Oops.

574
00:39:01,641 --> 00:39:03,642
( chuckles )
You know what?

575
00:39:03,643 --> 00:39:05,644
I got stuck
in a building

576
00:39:05,645 --> 00:39:09,314
that had
the power door in front
but no ramp

577
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:11,684
and then a ramp in back
with no power door

578
00:39:11,685 --> 00:39:13,786
and it pissed me off.
I yelled at some city guy

579
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:15,788
for more curb cuts.

580
00:39:15,789 --> 00:39:18,557
You know what?
I was just heading out.

581
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:22,294
Where are you going?

582
00:39:22,295 --> 00:39:24,863
Uh...

583
00:39:24,864 --> 00:39:26,699
I was gonna go talk

584
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,701
to the door guy
or brooster.

585
00:39:28,702 --> 00:39:31,403
You were gonna go
talk to the door guy
or brooster?

586
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:33,339
About what?

587
00:39:34,908 --> 00:39:37,176
I just didn't
want to be alone.

588
00:42:32,819 --> 00:42:34,753
CHILD'S VOICE:
<i>Wake up.</i>

ISAAC'S VOICE:
<i>My first thought is,</i>

590
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:27,439
<i>"there's</i>
<i>something in my shoe</i>
<i>besides my foot."</i>

591
00:43:35,448 --> 00:43:37,449
<i>Then I feel</i>
<i>a pin dart,</i>

<i>then waves</i>
<i>of hot pins</i>

<i>The urge to stand</i>

<i>Should I call 911?</i>

596
00:44:07,213 --> 00:44:09,114
<i>But what would I say?</i>

597
00:44:09,115 --> 00:44:11,784
<i>"come quickly,</i>
<i>I'm being healed"?</i>

Don't worry

Fiona Ankany?

Hey.

00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:01,787
Oh, God.

612
00:47:01,788 --> 00:47:04,390
Hello.

613
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:09,628
I have
the coolest news.

614
00:47:09,629 --> 00:47:12,564
I have some
pretty cool news myself.

615
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:15,434
Um... I don't know
if I should tell you.

616
00:47:15,435 --> 00:47:18,137
- What?
- Okay, you first.

617
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:21,273
You scratch mine,
I scratch yours.

618
00:47:21,274 --> 00:47:23,275
Okay.
Well...

619
00:47:23,276 --> 00:47:25,644
I have decided

620
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:28,180
to come out

621
00:47:28,181 --> 00:47:30,616
about my wheelchair.

622
00:47:30,617 --> 00:47:33,118
I'm going to tell
my mother.

623
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,120
Yeah, I'm going
to tell her

624
00:47:35,121 --> 00:47:36,855
and then I'm going
to tell everybody.

625
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:40,325
I'm going to be
in my wheelchair
24/7.

626
00:47:40,326 --> 00:47:42,928
Oh, God,
that would be heaven.

627
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:44,930
That would be
so heaven,

628
00:47:44,931 --> 00:47:48,467
but I'm so nervous
and you have to
come with me.

629
00:47:48,468 --> 00:47:50,469
I wouldn't miss it.

630
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:52,938
You wouldn't?

631
00:47:56,576 --> 00:47:59,812
- Do you want
to hear mine?
- Yes.

632
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:03,248
Okay, but it's
kind of... visual.

633
00:48:03,249 --> 00:48:05,250
Really?

634
00:48:05,251 --> 00:48:07,920
Uh-huh.
Should I be scared?

635
00:48:14,894 --> 00:48:16,895
No.
Oh, God.

636
00:48:16,896 --> 00:48:19,565
( laughs )
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

637
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:21,567
I shouldn't have
surprised you like that.

638
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:24,003
- I just couldn't resist.
- Oh My God, no.

639
00:48:24,004 --> 00:48:25,804
Wait wait
wait wait wait.
What? How?

640
00:48:25,805 --> 00:48:27,806
- It was our sex
last night.
- Shut up.

641
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:30,642
I don't know
how it happened.
The point is, I can walk.

642
00:48:30,643 --> 00:48:32,644
Oh My God, oh My God.
I'm shaking.

643
00:48:32,645 --> 00:48:34,980
Look, you're making
me shake. Look what
you're doing to me.

644
00:48:34,981 --> 00:48:38,050
- Look at your hands.
- No. Okay, you are
weirding me out.

645
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:40,052
And that is not
easy to do.

646
00:48:40,053 --> 00:48:42,054
It's like,
did you ever sneeze

647
00:48:42,055 --> 00:48:44,623

a second chance?

Fiona,
how's work?

678
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:12,037
Oh, I am conserving

679
00:51:12,038 --> 00:51:14,773
the most beautiful
porcelain elephant,
Mama.

680
00:51:14,774 --> 00:51:18,644
It is turning out
beautifully,
so beautiful.

681
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:21,013
You know what?
I should do more
sculpting.

682
00:51:23,683 --> 00:51:26,485
- I didn't know
you sculpt.
- Oh, yeah.

683
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:28,921
I've been
thinking of making
a porcelain elephant

684
00:51:28,922 --> 00:51:30,823
like the one
I'm working on.

685
00:51:30,824 --> 00:51:33,192
You don't
really sculpt.

686
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:35,494
I could be that good
if I had the time.

687

<i>You're comparing yourself</i>
<i>to the master sculptors?</i>

688
00:51:37,997 --> 00:51:40,933
Why not?
There are steps
to everything.

689
00:51:40,934 --> 00:51:43,202
I can just
follow the steps
and in, like, 10 years

690
00:51:43,203 --> 00:51:45,771
I can be that good.
It's easy.
Anybody could.

691
00:51:45,772 --> 00:51:47,773
It's one thing
to scrape the dirt

692
00:51:47,774 --> 00:51:49,775
off someone
else's work.
I would think

693
00:51:49,776 --> 00:51:53,879
you would
at least need to take
a drawing class.

694
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:57,016
Okay, I will.
And then I'll take
a sculpture class.

695
00:51:57,017 --> 00:51:59,351
And then I'll take
whatever class
is necessary

696
00:51:59,352 --> 00:52:01,353
and eventually I will be
at least that good.

697
00:52:01,354 --> 00:52:03,989
You can be
whatever you want
to be.

You know what, Mother?

702
00:52:24,344 --> 00:52:26,278
Who are you
to tell me

703
00:52:26,279 --> 00:52:29,048
that I can't make
a beautiful porcelain
elephant,

704
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:31,884
as beautiful
or even more beautiful

705
00:52:31,885 --> 00:52:34,887
than anyone else
can make a porcelain
elephant, hmm?

706
00:52:34,888 --> 00:52:37,790

elephants?

708
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:43,028
- Not one single
drawing class.
- That's not fair.

709
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:45,864

to say it?

712
00:52:51,671 --> 00:52:54,406
What if I'm
saying it now?
Is it too late?

713
00:52:54,407 --> 00:52:56,241
Did I miss the cutoff?
I don't understand.

714
00:52:56,242 --> 00:52:58,077
It's better to list
your accomplishments

715
00:52:58,078 --> 00:52:59,978
after you've done them.
Don't you agree, Isaac?

716
00:52:59,979 --> 00:53:03,582
- Don't bring him into this.

you want to be.

762
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:49,081
I don't want to be
a wannabe anymore.

763
00:55:50,984 --> 00:55:53,252
You think I don't know
what it's like
to pretend?

764
00:55:53,253 --> 00:55:55,487
I'm pretending
right now.

765
00:55:59,726 --> 00:56:04,563
Look, I could
sit down right now,

766
00:56:04,564 --> 00:56:06,665
take off my shoes

767
00:56:06,666 --> 00:56:08,600
and my legs
would be gone.

768
00:56:10,637 --> 00:56:12,271
What?

769
00:56:12,272 --> 00:56:16,108
These shoes
are making me walk

<i>even though</i>
<i>I know they can't</i>

771
00:56:17,844 --> 00:56:20,012
any more
than a patch

772
00:56:20,013 --> 00:56:22,047
can make a kid
run faster.

773
00:56:40,333 --> 00:56:42,935
Shut up.

774
00:56:44,204 --> 00:56:46,672
What does it feel like
when you take them off?

775
00:56:50,477 --> 00:56:53,145
Like you've
just taken
a deep breath,

776
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:56,982
but before
you can exhale

777
00:56:56,983 --> 00:56:59,251
somebody
steals it away.

778
00:57:09,629 --> 00:57:12,197
Oh, Isaac.

779
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:21,206
Please don't.

780
00:57:21,207 --> 00:57:23,609
Shh, it's okay.

781
00:57:29,816 --> 00:57:32,317
- I wonder what
they'll do to me.
- I asked you, please don't--

782
00:57:32,318 --> 00:57:34,253
Shh, it's okay.

783
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:46,165
Are you making
this up?

784
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:48,200
Or do you have to
wear them both?

785
00:57:58,144 --> 00:58:00,179
- Nothin'.
- Please take
them off now.

786
00:58:17,364 --> 00:58:19,365
Do you think
maybe they

787
00:58:19,366 --> 00:58:21,367
pinch a nerve
in your foot

788
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:23,702
or stimulate
something?

789
00:58:25,372 --> 00:58:27,306
Now you know.

790
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:33,712
What?

791
00:59:05,812 --> 00:59:08,213
If you can just
toss me my shoes,
I can dry off here.

792
00:59:12,318 --> 00:59:14,319
<i>It's the worst--</i>

793
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:17,556
<i>Handling my own</i>
<i>wet legs.</i>

794
00:59:17,557 --> 00:59:20,693
It's like trying
to nail jell-o
to the ceiling.

795
00:59:29,969 --> 00:59:31,970
Hey.

796
00:59:31,971 --> 00:59:33,906
Come on.

797
00:59:40,947 --> 00:59:43,382
Are you gonna
make me crawl?

798
00:59:55,995 --> 00:59:58,831
I thought
it would go away
when I met you,

799
00:59:58,832 --> 01:00:02,067
but it didn't.

800
01:00:02,068 --> 01:00:05,004
<i>And then when I saw</i>
<i>that you weren't</i>

801

and you were so happy

802
01:00:09,009 --> 01:00:13,178
it made me want
to be happy walking.

803
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:16,615
And I almost was.

804
01:00:16,616 --> 01:00:19,918
You know, I mean,
I tried.

805
01:00:19,919 --> 01:00:23,255
- I really did, I tried.
- Can you just toss me
my shoes?

806
01:00:25,158 --> 01:00:27,092
I will...

807
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:31,530
After you
help me become
a T12 paraplegic.

808
01:00:36,336 --> 01:00:39,605
Like you're ordering
off a menu.

809
01:00:39,606 --> 01:00:42,875
It's important to be
an authentic person

811

Paralyze yourself.

812
01:00:47,881 --> 01:00:49,581
No, it has to be you.

813
01:00:49,582 --> 01:00:51,483

820
01:02:09,429 --> 01:02:11,964
I can't answer that.

You think I choose

822

I've lost because
I revealed myself

I'll tell you why

- I'm about to be
hilarious.

913
01:09:24,698 --> 01:09:26,699
Hysterical blindness,
hysterical pregnancy--

914
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:29,802
You have hysterical
paralysis.

915
01:09:29,803 --> 01:09:33,005
Isaac, how many doctors
have you let examine you
in your life?

916
01:09:48,555 --> 01:09:51,123
<i>What makes a person</i>
<i>want to be paralyzed</i>

917
01:09:51,124 --> 01:09:53,592
who isn't?

918
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,068
( rain pattering )

919
01:10:43,343 --> 01:10:45,611
( panting )

920
01:11:08,868 --> 01:11:10,969
I used to think
if aliens landed

921
01:11:10,970 --> 01:11:15,240
and they saw all
the able-bodied people

922
01:11:15,241 --> 01:11:18,477
and then they
saw the people
on their wheelchairs,

923
01:11:18,478 --> 01:11:21,647
<i>they would say</i>
<i>that those must be</i>

924
01:11:21,648 --> 01:11:25,484
the Kings and Queens

925
01:11:25,485 --> 01:11:28,087
because they have
special ramps

926
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:30,689
and they never
have to get up.

927
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:37,863
<i>I have this fantasy</i>
<i>that maybe someday</i>

928
01:11:37,864 --> 01:11:41,066
after we haven't
seen each other
in some time...

929
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:46,338
I'll hear you say
that you forgive me...

930
01:11:46,339 --> 01:11:49,074
- ( grunts )
<i>-...like,</i>

931
01:11:49,075 --> 01:11:51,076
on the radio--

932
01:11:51,077 --> 01:11:53,245
you know,
say my name

933
01:11:53,246 --> 01:11:55,180
<i>maybe.</i>

934
01:12:30,717 --> 01:12:32,651
( inhales )

935
01:12:35,455 --> 01:12:38,657
( exhales )

936
01:13:16,896 --> 01:13:19,365
That was
the last time
I saw her.

937
01:13:19,366 --> 01:13:21,367
<i>I went back</i>
<i>to her apartment,</i>

938
01:13:21,368 --> 01:13:23,869
<i>but she'd moved out</i>
<i>almost overnight.</i>

939
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:28,073
There was
no forwarding address.

940
01:13:30,844 --> 01:13:34,346
<i>I know a guy</i>
<i>who can find</i>
<i>anything on anybody,</i>

941
01:13:34,347 --> 01:13:37,249
<i>and even he</i>
<i>doesn't know</i>
<i>where she went.</i>

942
01:13:37,250 --> 01:13:39,251
<i>Her mother</i>
<i>doesn't know either.</i>

943
01:13:39,252 --> 01:13:42,254
<i>I went to see her</i>
<i>and we talked about</i>
<i>that day,</i>

944
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:45,257
<i>the morning</i>
<i>it happened.</i>

945
01:13:45,258 --> 01:13:49,561
<i>"Do you feel</i>
<i>any responsibility</i>
<i>for the crash?"</i>

946
01:13:49,562 --> 01:13:52,664
<i>She just</i>
<i>stares off,</i>

947
01:13:52,665 --> 01:13:55,901
<i>contemplating</i>
<i>the fairness</i>
<i>of a question</i>

948
01:13:55,902 --> 01:13:58,971
<i>she will</i>
<i>never answer.</i>

949
01:14:11,251 --> 01:14:15,320
<i>Now it's November,</i>
<i>two months since</i>
<i>I've seen her.</i>

950
01:14:15,321 --> 01:14:17,322
<i>This is</i>
<i>the second time</i>
<i>in my life</i>

951
01:14:17,323 --> 01:14:21,927
<i>she's crashed into me</i>
<i>and then vanished.</i>

952
01:14:21,928 --> 01:14:25,898
<i>I find myself</i>
<i>going back to places</i>
<i>we'd been together--</i>

953
01:14:25,899 --> 01:14:29,068
<i>Not in the way</i>
<i>you do when you can't</i>
<i>get over someone,</i>

954
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:31,804
<i>I just go</i>
<i>to think about her</i>

955
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:35,407
<i>and to feel...</i>

956
01:14:35,408 --> 01:14:38,310
<i>restored.</i>

957
01:14:42,649 --> 01:14:44,650
<i>Isaac Knott,</i>

958
01:14:44,651 --> 01:14:47,052
<i>Public Radio</i>
<i>New York.</i>

959
01:14:56,429 --> 01:14:59,007
<i>( instrumental</i>
<i> music playing )</i>

960
01:20:47,053 --> 01:20:48,053
