1
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,083
You in the dinghy! This is the police.

2
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:30,276
Put your hands on your head.

3
00:01:38,321 --> 00:01:40,293
Mick?

4
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,043
G'day, Sarge!

5
00:01:43,391 --> 00:01:45,802
I might have known it would be you.

6
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:49,960
It's these New York fish, Sarge,
they won't take the bait.

7
00:01:57,018 --> 00:01:59,034
Breakfast.

8
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:02,873
Get outta here! Come on, let's go.

9
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,226
Mick?

10
00:03:29,036 --> 00:03:30,455
Breakfast.

11
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,515
What are you doing? You scared me.

12
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,044
- Just admiring the view. Want coffee?
- Yeah.

13
00:04:05,716 --> 00:04:08,285
- Thinking about home?
- Yeah.

14
00:04:08,489 --> 00:04:12,240
- You must miss it.
- The bush? A bit.

15
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,807
I could be in the bar
at Walkabout Creek right now,

16
00:04:16,015 --> 00:04:19,575
gazing across at Wally
and Nugget and Donk.

17
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:25,242
Or I could be here looking at you.
No contest.

18
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:29,600
- I'm thinking about looking for a job.
- You're kidding.

19
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,202
No. A man can't stay
on holidays for ever.

20
00:04:34,236 --> 00:04:37,830
Well, you seem to have
managed OK so far.

21
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:44,414
I'd have done it last week, but I wanted
to see Doug meet his twin brother.

22
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:48,569
- Doug who?
- On TV. Days of Our Lives.

23
00:04:48,774 --> 00:04:53,562
Oh, Mick! We definitely
have to get you a job!

24
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:04,142
Mick, my friend didn't see you throw.
Could you show him?

25
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:08,341
- You can play. I've got to go to work.
- Play?

26
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:11,548
- Don't forget lunch.
- No worries. Right...

27
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:14,317
- Where's the rabbit?
- Here it is.

28
00:05:14,521 --> 00:05:17,721
Put the rabbit down there
and get out of the way.

29
00:05:17,928 --> 00:05:20,541
- Rocks.
- Don't miss, Mick.

30
00:05:23,355 --> 00:05:26,397
- Close your eyes!
- Oh, all right.

31
00:05:26,603 --> 00:05:28,462
One...

32
00:05:28,663 --> 00:05:30,555
...two...

33
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,181
...three...

34
00:05:32,386 --> 00:05:34,482
...four. OK, you can look.

35
00:05:40,823 --> 00:05:42,840
- Any good?
- That was the best.

36
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:48,146
Know how come he can do that?
In the bush, if you miss, you don't eat.

37
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,777
Yes, but that's only half of it.
First, you gotta find the animals.

38
00:05:52,984 --> 00:05:55,519
What's this?

39
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:58,567
- A snake. That's a snake trail.
- Quick.

40
00:05:58,768 --> 00:06:01,100
Snakes are good eating.

41
00:06:02,055 --> 00:06:04,387
What's this one?

42
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:10,405
- That's a goanna, a real big lizard.
- Right.

43
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,574
You can eat it,
but it tastes like shit, right?

44
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,622
Yeah... Here's another one, real quick.

45
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,881
What's that? Don't know?

46
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,973
Dunlop radials, Tony's bike.

47
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,651
- That was a good one.
- All right, practise. Bye.

48
00:06:30,853 --> 00:06:32,318
- See you later!
- Bye!

49
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,524
- Don't forget lunch!
- That was good.

50
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:43,717
G'day, all.

51
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:47,248
- What'll you have?
- Just a beer, mate.

52
00:06:49,233 --> 00:06:52,353
- Mind if I make an announcement?
- Go ahead.

53
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,656
Thanks.

54
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:57,865
Mick Dundee's the name.
Fairly new in town.

55
00:06:58,066 --> 00:07:00,679
Looking for some kind of a job.

56
00:07:01,393 --> 00:07:03,567
Any suggestions?

57
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:07,527
That's enough job hunting for one day.

58
00:07:07,731 --> 00:07:11,088
- Yo, Mick, my man!
- G'day, Leroy.

59
00:07:11,811 --> 00:07:14,538
- You're looking for work?
- Kinda.

60
00:07:14,743 --> 00:07:17,029
Well, then look no further.

61
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:20,641
- I can get you into something sweet.
- Great.

62
00:07:20,843 --> 00:07:24,763
Let me grab some cigarettes,
then we'll talk business.

63
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,034
Hey.

64
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,598
- You're pretty tight with Leroy.
- Yeah, nice fella.

65
00:07:32,805 --> 00:07:35,656
Let me warn you, he's a bad dude.

66
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,582
He's into some pretty heavy shit.

67
00:07:38,787 --> 00:07:42,662
- Leroy? Seems harmless enough.
- Just so you know.

68
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:48,405
Yo, Mick, let's walk.
Less ears on the street.

69
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:51,055
OK... Back in a sec.

70
00:08:02,277 --> 00:08:06,355
OK, like... I got a little
supply business going, right?

71
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:11,579
- Hey, like you will work for me.
- What would I be doing?

72
00:08:11,783 --> 00:08:14,667
- Delivering stuff.
- Stuff?

73
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:26,988
This is just between you and me.
It goes no further, right?

74
00:08:27,192 --> 00:08:28,691
Right.

75
00:08:34,322 --> 00:08:36,259
Stationery.

76
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:38,196
Stationery?

77
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:45,131
You know. Pens, erasers,
office supplies...

78
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,750
- And that's heavy shit?
- No, man, it ain't.

79
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,818
I'm strictly legit.

80
00:08:53,019 --> 00:08:58,438
But if you have a name like Leroy Brown,
people expect you to be bad.

81
00:08:58,644 --> 00:09:02,158
- Like the song.
- Oh, right!

82
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:04,620
But...

83
00:09:04,823 --> 00:09:07,753
- I kinda like the image.
- Yeah.

84
00:09:07,953 --> 00:09:10,882
- You dig?
- Yup. Dig.

85
00:09:11,082 --> 00:09:14,799
Is that part of the job? Digging?

86
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:18,676
Man, you really are prehistoric.
You want the job?

87
00:09:18,885 --> 00:09:23,156
I dunno, Leroy.
Don't really know what I wanna do yet.

88
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:26,719
OK. When you make up your mind,
you let me know.

89
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,785
OK.

90
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:31,945
In the meantime...

91
00:09:32,155 --> 00:09:34,599
...I gotta split.

92
00:09:37,344 --> 00:09:39,755
You be cool.

93
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:06,730
Beast. The perfect gift for Donk.

94
00:10:19,333 --> 00:10:22,690
Well, it makes a man irresistible.

95
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:28,950
You don't sound very convincing.
I think I'll test it.

96
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:49,824
Doesn't work.

97
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:52,398
Well, it doesn't!

98
00:10:57,122 --> 00:11:01,550
I'd like to get Wally the kind of thing
you can only buy in America.

99
00:11:01,757 --> 00:11:03,300
Hello.

100
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:11,609
Maybe cushions saying "I love New York"
that you put in your car.

101
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:29,559
Hi, Sue. What are you doing?

102
00:11:29,762 --> 00:11:34,550
Hi, Doris. Nothing exciting,
just going through some mail.

103
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:40,097
- Bob Tanner. Isn't he your ex-husband?
- We still keep in touch.

104
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,702
Sue, he's cute!
Where was I when you two broke up?

105
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:47,937
- I could have consoled him!
- That's gonna be difficult.

106
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:53,370
He spends most of his time in Colombia.
That's where the action is.

107
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:58,390
Que sera, sera... Speaking of action,
when am I gonna meet Tarzan?

108
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:01,957
- You mean Mick?
- You have another hot jungle lover?

109
00:12:02,164 --> 00:12:05,048
- Soon, I promise.
- Sue...

110
00:12:05,254 --> 00:12:08,217
What's he like in bed?

111
00:12:08,423 --> 00:12:10,473
I dunno. He still sleeps on the floor.

112
00:12:19,277 --> 00:12:22,003
OK, some visitors.

113
00:12:31,556 --> 00:12:34,203
This must be Rico.

114
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:40,424
Hello, Rico. Nice suit.

115
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,970
Cómo está, huh?

116
00:12:47,005 --> 00:12:49,258
A little slimy...

117
00:12:53,976 --> 00:12:56,466
What the hell's this?

118
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:02,174
Shit!

119
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:04,956
- Operador.
- This is Seòor Tanner in Room 1 1.

120
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:06,781
Would you get me...

121
00:14:06,981 --> 00:14:10,147
...Bogota 6-3-7?
- Sí, senor.

122
00:14:10,348 --> 00:14:12,049
Gracias.

123
00:14:19,736 --> 00:14:21,944
- Hello.
- Your call.

124
00:14:22,152 --> 00:14:24,484
- Brannigan.
- Something's happened.

125
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:27,177
Get me out. I want protection.

126
00:14:27,381 --> 00:14:30,501
OK, you'll get it. Just calm down.

127
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,750
So, what have you got?

128
00:14:34,907 --> 00:14:37,949
Rico was at the cocaine plant.

129
00:14:38,155 --> 00:14:39,574
Yeah, it was him.

130
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,127
And he killed a guy, personally.
I took pictures of the whole thing.

131
00:14:44,334 --> 00:14:48,368
- Great. Did you send them off?
- Yeah, but not to you.

132
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:52,730
- But I'll send you framed copies.
- Where did you send them?

133
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:56,051
Sure, I tell you,
and you kiss me goodbye.

134
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:59,502
They shot at me!
Now come and get me!

135
00:14:59,704 --> 00:15:04,289
OK, stay put. We'll be there in an hour.
You'll be on the next flight.

136
00:15:04,497 --> 00:15:06,863
- Great.
- You did a great job.

137
00:15:07,071 --> 00:15:10,992
Thank you very much.
Just come and get me.

138
00:15:13,687 --> 00:15:15,895
- Operador.
- Hi, it's me again.

139
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:21,048
Would you get me
New York City 21 2-555-6432?

140
00:15:21,252 --> 00:15:23,899
- Sí, senor. Nueva York.
- Thank you.

141
00:15:41,534 --> 00:15:43,235
Sue, listen...

142
00:15:45,693 --> 00:15:48,577
Hello. This is Mick Dundee here.

143
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:52,422
I'm not really here,
this is a recording. Good, isn't it?

144
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:54,123
Sue's not here either,

145
00:15:54,328 --> 00:15:57,257
and you should leave a message
after the beep.

146
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:03,319
Hey, great message.
Sue, this is Robert.

147
00:16:03,518 --> 00:16:07,236
I sent you a letter. Don't open it
until you hear from me.

148
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:12,183
There's nobody else that I trust.
This is big with a capital B.

149
00:16:12,391 --> 00:16:14,171
Bye.

150
00:16:38,931 --> 00:16:41,263
- G'day, Ralph.
- How's it hangin'?

151
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:45,702
- Good, mate. Anything for me?
- Got something for your lady friend.

152
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:48,235
There you go.

153
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:53,780
What about this one?

154
00:16:53,983 --> 00:16:56,427
My fellow Americans,

155
00:16:56,637 --> 00:16:59,567
let me make one thing perfectly clear.

156
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,902
That's funny, Ralph. Who is it?

157
00:17:07,293 --> 00:17:11,326
It's Nixon! You know, Tricky Dicky?

158
00:17:12,403 --> 00:17:15,884
No, I don't know him.
Does he live round here?

159
00:17:16,087 --> 00:17:19,331
He used to be the President!

160
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:22,496
Oh, right. Yeah, that was just like him.

161
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:25,112
- I'll work on it.
- See you, mate.

162
00:17:25,316 --> 00:17:27,648
See you later, Mick.

163
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:49,235
Hey, you ugly mother.
Gimme your wallet!

164
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,975
Hey, relax! It's just me, man.

165
00:17:52,173 --> 00:17:54,031
- Leroy!
- How you doin'?

166
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:56,846
- Fancy a drink?
- Sounds good.

167
00:17:57,045 --> 00:18:00,718
- I got a couple of deliveries to make.
- Can I help?

168
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:05,749
This goes to Moore, Bank and Patterson,
on the 23rd floor of that building.

169
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:09,472
- No worries. See you back here.
- In five minutes.

170
00:18:16,177 --> 00:18:18,509
- G'day.
- Yes.

171
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:22,587
- Can I help you?
- That's your stationery.

172
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:25,643
Can you wait while I check this?

173
00:18:26,714 --> 00:18:28,449
Yeah, sure.

174
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,082
Hey, there's a guy
walking past your window.

175
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:44,254
- OK, what's the gag?
- No, serious.

176
00:18:45,609 --> 00:18:49,609
Oh, my God. It's a jumper.
I'd better call the police.

177
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:53,450
- A what?
- A jumper. A suicide!

178
00:18:55,512 --> 00:18:58,554
Maybe I should go and talk to him.

179
00:19:07,435 --> 00:19:10,082
Don't try to stop me.

180
00:19:10,287 --> 00:19:14,557
- I don't want to. I just wanna get past.
- What?

181
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:18,086
- I wanna get by. You're in the way.
- You're kidding.

182
00:19:18,803 --> 00:19:21,090
No. I walk around here every day.

183
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,577
Get away from the noise and traffic,
get fresh air.

184
00:19:24,785 --> 00:19:27,635
You had the same idea yourself,
did you?

185
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:34,009
I don't give a damn about the air!
I'm about to throw myself off the building.

186
00:19:37,777 --> 00:19:40,221
You could kill yourself.

187
00:19:40,431 --> 00:19:42,718
That's the whole idea.

188
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:47,635
Oh, right. I'll just wait
till you've finished.

189
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:07,204
Would you mind getting a move on?
I'm on my lunch break.

190
00:20:07,407 --> 00:20:10,290
I can't do it with you watching.

191
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:13,110
Oh... Sorry.

192
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,646
Just out of curiosity, why...?

193
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:38,812
Have you ever been hopelessly
and completely in love,

194
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:41,225
only to find out that...

195
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:44,396
...that you've been used?

196
00:20:44,602 --> 00:20:47,531
No, I can't say that I have.

197
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:52,286
I loved that bitch!

198
00:20:54,901 --> 00:20:57,751
- It's all right.
- And he betrayed me.

199
00:20:57,951 --> 00:20:59,337
He?

200
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,858
Screw that!

201
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:45,561
Hello, Sue. No trouble, darling.
Let's get into the car, OK?

202
00:23:01,539 --> 00:23:03,556
Sit.

203
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,116
Sue Charlton.

204
00:23:33,546 --> 00:23:35,878
You got something for me?

205
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:41,894
- Who are you and what do you want?
- Forgive me. I am Luís Rico.

206
00:23:42,102 --> 00:23:46,890
Your ex-husband Bob sent you a film.
It belongs to me. I want it back.

207
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:50,022
Bob? I don't know
what you're talking about.

208
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:55,371
This is very simple.
We do business and you go home.

209
00:23:58,857 --> 00:24:03,015
He sent you a letter. Where is it?

210
00:24:03,215 --> 00:24:06,098
I don't know what you're talking about.

211
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:11,484
It's here by now.
He left a message on your machine.

212
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:15,612
I never got any message.
The machine's been broken.

213
00:24:26,387 --> 00:24:28,483
Felipe.

214
00:24:28,685 --> 00:24:31,727
He says the boyfriend is back.

215
00:24:31,933 --> 00:24:34,659
What do you want him to do?

216
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:38,903
- His name?
- Mick.

217
00:24:40,608 --> 00:24:42,974
He lives with you?

218
00:24:44,411 --> 00:24:48,365
- Does he check the mail?
- Yeah, I guess.

219
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:57,083
Tell Felipe to bring Mick
around for a coffee.

220
00:25:00,255 --> 00:25:03,928
He says that the DEA...
they staked out the place.

221
00:25:05,088 --> 00:25:09,245
- Brannigan just went inside the building.
- Mierda!

222
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:17,878
Tell him to just sit tight.
This is getting out of hand.

223
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,251
Call Mick. And pray he has some brains.

224
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:37,765
He does like I tell him,
you both come out alive.

225
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:52,972
Sue?

226
00:26:10,526 --> 00:26:12,463
Just a second.

227
00:26:13,893 --> 00:26:15,673
- Yeah?
- Mick.

228
00:26:15,874 --> 00:26:19,355
- You should see the joint...
- Listen, I'm in trouble.

229
00:26:19,558 --> 00:26:22,915
- Did you check the mail today?
- Yeah, why?

230
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,973
Was there a letter for me
from Colombia?

231
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:32,467
Hang on a second... Colombia.
Yeah, I've got it here.

232
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:34,956
- Thank God.
- What's going on?

233
00:26:35,165 --> 00:26:38,882
- Mick, I'm being held prisoner...
- Shut up and listen.

234
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:42,567
- Who's this?
- There's a cop coming to see you.

235
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:46,488
Give him nothing. Get rid of him,
or your lady is dead.

236
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,542
Call you back in two minutes.

237
00:26:49,742 --> 00:26:51,082
Listen...

238
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:06,848
Brannigan.
Drug Enforcement Administration.

239
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:11,164
- Is Sue Charlton in?
- Not at the moment, no.

240
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:16,591
- When do you expect her?
- I'm not sure.

241
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:20,908
You know these big-time reporters,
out reporting all hours.

242
00:27:21,114 --> 00:27:24,674
Would you ask her to call,
if you bump into her?

243
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:26,217
Sure.

244
00:27:26,422 --> 00:27:30,095
- Aren't you gonna ask what it's about?
- Not my business.

245
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:31,803
OK, fine.

246
00:27:43,178 --> 00:27:44,563
Yes?

247
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:48,165
Bring the letter to Hoyt Street station,
downtown side.

248
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:50,811
Wait till someone comes. You got that?

249
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:54,142
Yes. I wanna talk to Sue. Now.

250
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:59,180
- Mick, do what they say and be careful.
- You just hang on.

251
00:27:59,379 --> 00:28:01,914
One thing more, amigo.

252
00:28:02,112 --> 00:28:05,390
If you're followed, if you screw this up...

253
00:28:05,598 --> 00:28:09,755
...your lady is dead. Comprendes?

254
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,892
Yeah, I got it.

255
00:28:30,989 --> 00:28:33,479
- A little mustard?
- Yeah.

256
00:28:35,465 --> 00:28:37,200
Ketchup?

257
00:30:06,057 --> 00:30:08,344
OK, here she is.

258
00:30:09,543 --> 00:30:11,086
Mom?

259
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:29,459
- Finished?
- What?

260
00:30:29,666 --> 00:30:31,524
Are you finished?

261
00:30:31,725 --> 00:30:36,310
Don't put it away.
Put your hands up on the wall.

262
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:40,033
- Now, where's Sue Charlton?
- Who's that?

263
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:46,139
Lord! Man, no!
How should I know where she is?

264
00:30:46,342 --> 00:30:49,936
I've been following you.
Brannigan told me to follow you.

265
00:30:50,145 --> 00:30:53,187
- Brannigan. So you're a cop?
- Yeah, DEA.

266
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,330
- Can I do up my fly?
- No.

267
00:30:55,532 --> 00:30:58,619
- All right.
- What do you want with Sue?

268
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,791
Pictures. We think she's got...

269
00:31:00,998 --> 00:31:04,716
...photographs of a guy named Rico.
Evidence, you know.

270
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,086
- Who's Rico?
- A big-time drug dealer, a killer.

271
00:31:08,287 --> 00:31:11,216
- Where is he? Where does he live?
- How do I know?

272
00:31:11,416 --> 00:31:14,819
Look, I think I've been
more than reasonable, so...

273
00:31:15,021 --> 00:31:20,676
What do you say you and me just forget
this little incident ever took place, OK?

274
00:31:20,883 --> 00:31:24,444
'Cause it's kind of embarrassing,
you know?

275
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:27,450
He's gone.

276
00:31:32,727 --> 00:31:35,262
Are you OK, buddy?

277
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,965
You gotta be Dundee.

278
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:13,879
- Where's the girl?
- Coming in on the next train.

279
00:32:16,459 --> 00:32:19,658
- The item?
- We'll wait.

280
00:32:52,624 --> 00:32:56,263
She must have got off at the wrong stop.

281
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,604
No, no, no...

282
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:04,900
Keep going.

283
00:33:09,736 --> 00:33:12,226
Now, that's a knife.

284
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:17,774
...the legendary New York City subway,
completed in nineteen hundred and...

285
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:21,253
...it's the most extensive subway
system in the world,

286
00:33:21,461 --> 00:33:25,731
encompassing 481.2 real miles.

287
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,864
Feel free to take pictures.

288
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:33,303
Please get on the train
in an orderly fashion...

289
00:33:38,296 --> 00:33:40,268
No, no... Go on...

290
00:33:41,742 --> 00:33:43,082
Yeah.

291
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:49,306
How does this work?

292
00:33:50,338 --> 00:33:53,109
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

293
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:57,703
He'll kill somebody, he's crazy!
Where are you going?

294
00:33:57,904 --> 00:34:00,314
I'm gonna get into trouble!

295
00:34:47,022 --> 00:34:50,266
- Thank you.
- Slap me five.

296
00:34:52,172 --> 00:34:54,819
You know who that was?
Clint Eastwood!

297
00:34:55,024 --> 00:34:56,961
Clint Eastwood?

298
00:34:58,906 --> 00:35:00,843
Yes, very tall.

299
00:35:04,372 --> 00:35:06,581
Yes.

300
00:35:06,788 --> 00:35:08,287
Clint Eastwood.

301
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,086
You know what this is?

302
00:35:16,295 --> 00:35:21,636
- Cocaine.
- Wrong. It's money and power.

303
00:35:21,841 --> 00:35:25,480
With this, you can do
anything to anybody.

304
00:35:27,268 --> 00:35:29,205
Five, ten years from now,

305
00:35:29,407 --> 00:35:33,598
I'm gonna retire,
buy myself a little island.

306
00:35:33,804 --> 00:35:35,459
Hawaii, maybe.

307
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:45,801
Who do you think you are?

308
00:35:46,757 --> 00:35:52,412
You threaten to kill people and then
act like you're some sort of a rock star.

309
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,345
You're a drug dealer.

310
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:57,646
Grubby little parasite.

311
00:36:01,254 --> 00:36:04,184
You should watch your mouth.

312
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:08,017
It's not wise to annoy me.

313
00:36:09,058 --> 00:36:13,530
Bob Tanner did and I had
his head blown off like that.

314
00:36:13,732 --> 00:36:15,940
You killed Bob?

315
00:36:16,148 --> 00:36:19,426
And if your Mick screws this up...

316
00:37:41,828 --> 00:37:44,363
Wakey, wakey.

317
00:37:49,553 --> 00:37:53,428
You kill people for a living.
Not very good at it, are you?

318
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:56,483
- You should try another business.
- Shove it!

319
00:37:56,683 --> 00:37:59,927
- You're too heavy to be clever.
- Are you kidding?

320
00:38:00,129 --> 00:38:01,942
You ain't gonna...!

321
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,017
Scary, eh?

322
00:38:14,033 --> 00:38:16,443
Please! What do you want?

323
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:24,171
Please! What do you want?

324
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:30,425
- Where's the girl?
- Rico's got her. At his place.

325
00:38:32,214 --> 00:38:34,704
And where exactly is that?

326
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:56,489
Thank God! I thought
you were gonna leave me here.

327
00:38:56,694 --> 00:39:00,412
- Long Island. That's east of here, right?
- Yeah.

328
00:39:01,448 --> 00:39:04,331
- Thanks.
- Hey!

329
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:13,043
Freeze! Hold it!

330
00:39:23,076 --> 00:39:24,811
Excuse me.

331
00:39:30,641 --> 00:39:33,604
Shall I go after him?

332
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:36,097
- Be my guest.
- Yeah.

333
00:39:48,704 --> 00:39:53,019
Mick, this is serious shit
you're talking about.

334
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:56,701
DEA, international drug rings...

335
00:39:56,904 --> 00:39:59,675
This is all hazardous to your health.

336
00:39:59,875 --> 00:40:03,987
Yeah, but... Think what it'll do
for your reputation.

337
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:05,657
Oh, yeah!

338
00:40:05,856 --> 00:40:10,565
Leroy Brown, the baddest man
in the whole damn cemetery!

339
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:15,232
I don't know how these people think.

340
00:40:15,442 --> 00:40:18,484
I need someone who's... roadwise.

341
00:40:20,314 --> 00:40:22,444
Roadwise.

342
00:40:30,455 --> 00:40:32,663
Let's go.

343
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:36,983
The car's... I mean, like,
the wheels are out back.

344
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:39,633
I'm cool.

345
00:40:39,843 --> 00:40:41,262
I'm cool.

346
00:41:00,441 --> 00:41:04,756
You mustn't let these minor disruptions
ruin your appetite.

347
00:41:04,957 --> 00:41:10,139
Try the lobster. I had it flown in
from Maine this morning.

348
00:41:10,344 --> 00:41:14,771
There's nothing wrong with the food,
it's the company.

349
00:41:29,556 --> 00:41:32,361
Would you look at this stuff!

350
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,765
There's TV cameras...

351
00:41:36,963 --> 00:41:39,171
...infra-red beams!

352
00:41:40,211 --> 00:41:44,481
They're gonna know you're there
before you do.

353
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,890
Maybe we should just call the police.

354
00:41:48,926 --> 00:41:50,975
Mick...

355
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:54,856
Guys like this own cops.

356
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:59,414
Even if the guys you call are straight,
what are they gonna do?

357
00:41:59,621 --> 00:42:02,268
Come with sirens wailing
and guns blazing?

358
00:42:02,473 --> 00:42:06,393
She'll be dead in two seconds,
if she's still alive.

359
00:42:12,455 --> 00:42:15,418
She's still alive.

360
00:42:15,624 --> 00:42:18,113
How do you know that?

361
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:22,192
That's the only way I can see her.
Up here.

362
00:42:22,397 --> 00:42:27,975
If I even start to think she's hurt,
my guts twist up, I can't think straight,

363
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:31,583
and I'm no good to her.

364
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:56,178
- So, what do we do now?
- We need some kind of distraction.

365
00:43:13,615 --> 00:43:19,553
When we get in, whatever you do,
be cool, go easy. These dogs bite.

366
00:43:19,755 --> 00:43:23,033
Fortunately,
they know my rep round here.

367
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:26,204
I'll just smooth the way.

368
00:43:48,117 --> 00:43:50,764
- Yo, Rat.
- Leroy.

369
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:56,039
I would consider it a personal favour
if you'll hear my man here.

370
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:03,080
- You're the crocodile man, ain't you?
- Yeah.

371
00:44:04,001 --> 00:44:05,500
I've seen you around.

372
00:44:08,953 --> 00:44:11,645
- I'm Rat.
- Hey, Rat.

373
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:15,438
What d'you want, crocodile man?

374
00:44:15,647 --> 00:44:20,626
- I've got a problem. I need your help.
- You've come to the right place.

375
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:23,765
That's what we're here for, huh?

376
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,408
Nice jacket.

377
00:44:29,907 --> 00:44:32,397
How can we be of service?

378
00:44:42,939 --> 00:44:47,051
Well, these heavy dudes
kidnapped my woman.

379
00:44:47,257 --> 00:44:51,651
They're holding her in a big mansion
and I'm gonna bust her out.

380
00:44:51,852 --> 00:44:53,947
"Heavy dudes"?

381
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,498
Lots of guys with machine guns,
shit like that?

382
00:44:58,705 --> 00:45:00,440
Probably.

383
00:45:00,646 --> 00:45:03,969
So, you want us
to charge down the guns.

384
00:45:04,171 --> 00:45:07,686
Death before dishonour, all that stuff?

385
00:45:07,895 --> 00:45:10,587
I'm the only one that's gonna get shot at.

386
00:45:12,014 --> 00:45:15,654
What I want from you is a distraction,
so I can get in.

387
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,382
So, what's in it for us?

388
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:25,915
Leroy tells me that your gang
is the coolest gang in New York.

389
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:28,651
That's the word.

390
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:36,136
- What did you do last night?
- We didn't do nothin'.

391
00:45:37,088 --> 00:45:39,105
We was here all night.

392
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:46,507
That's what you call cool, is it?

393
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:54,470
So tomorrow,
if someone asks you that question,

394
00:45:54,676 --> 00:45:58,788
you can say, "We didn't do nothin'."

395
00:45:58,994 --> 00:46:04,300
Or say, "We went to Long Island and
helped this lunatic storm a fortress."

396
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:16,692
At least you could watch me
get my head blown off.

397
00:46:16,898 --> 00:46:19,591
What are your chances?

398
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:21,209
Fair.

399
00:46:21,414 --> 00:46:26,281
What are your chances of getting
outta here with that jacket on?

400
00:46:34,486 --> 00:46:36,896
Better than average.

401
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,830
Yeah, I'll go along with that.

402
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:52,459
He wants to drive, let him drive!

403
00:46:52,667 --> 00:46:56,904
- I didn't think you'd get anybody.
- Would you miss this?

404
00:46:57,104 --> 00:46:59,199
- No.
- Exactly.

405
00:47:00,154 --> 00:47:03,590
Hey, yo! Like, be cool with the clutch!

406
00:47:07,363 --> 00:47:09,098
Hey, Judy, what's going on?

407
00:47:09,304 --> 00:47:12,819
Looks like these guys
are gonna blow up Long Island.

408
00:47:13,028 --> 00:47:17,535
- What the hell, let's check it out!
- Yeah, let's go, man!

409
00:47:20,475 --> 00:47:21,815
Go!

410
00:47:41,469 --> 00:47:44,398
OK, Kemo sabe. We're set.

411
00:47:44,598 --> 00:47:48,079
It's time for you to do
your Lone Ranger stuff.

412
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,062
Thanks, Rat.

413
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,117
Souvenir.

414
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,488
Good luck, Mick.

415
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:34,148
Miguel, there's something
going on outside, man.

416
00:48:34,350 --> 00:48:37,280
There is all this weird howling.

417
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,604
They're only kids, punks.
Go get rid of them.

418
00:48:48,809 --> 00:48:53,833
Don't start shooting at shadows.
We don't want the cops around.

419
00:48:54,037 --> 00:48:55,974
Do we?

420
00:49:24,776 --> 00:49:26,274
Shit.

421
00:49:26,479 --> 00:49:28,688
They don't even have machine guns!

422
00:49:39,749 --> 00:49:42,081
Yeah, like, he's cool.

423
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:33,178
That's my man!

424
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:35,320
What's happening here?

425
00:50:36,552 --> 00:50:39,323
What's going on here?

426
00:50:39,523 --> 00:50:43,241
- I'm in. What are we doing?
- What are you, a penguin?

427
00:50:43,445 --> 00:50:45,698
Who are these people?

428
00:50:45,901 --> 00:50:48,233
There he goes.

429
00:50:50,654 --> 00:50:52,749
Damn! He's going in!

430
00:50:54,021 --> 00:50:57,344
- He's going in!
- All right!

431
00:51:41,595 --> 00:51:43,803
- What's happening?
- Just kids.

432
00:51:44,011 --> 00:51:48,518
- They set off the alarm.
- Check the house anyway.

433
00:53:12,543 --> 00:53:14,322
- Leroy!
- Hey, Mick!

434
00:53:15,355 --> 00:53:17,372
Thought you might need a hand.

435
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:20,457
It looks like
you've taken care of business.

436
00:53:20,663 --> 00:53:22,995
Check out this party!

437
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:27,433
It don't fit.

438
00:53:30,606 --> 00:53:33,535
Where did all these people come from?

439
00:53:35,121 --> 00:53:39,042
Better ask Leroy.
He's in charge of the cavalry.

440
00:53:39,241 --> 00:53:42,091
It's like, curiosity, my man.

441
00:53:42,291 --> 00:53:44,702
Like, the word gets around,

442
00:53:44,906 --> 00:53:48,860
that bad, bad Leroy Brown
got something going down,

443
00:53:49,065 --> 00:53:52,659
they can't stay away.
I mean, with my reputation...

444
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:58,165
Mick, I gotta split.

445
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:01,179
Looks like explanation time.

446
00:54:07,999 --> 00:54:12,945
- How do you like your eggs, mate?
- Over easy, thanks, Mick.

447
00:54:26,181 --> 00:54:28,389
- Morning, Miss Charlton.
- Morning.

448
00:54:28,597 --> 00:54:32,912
I was assigned to guard your door.
Mick invited me in.

449
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:46,735
- Morning.
- G'day.

450
00:54:46,937 --> 00:54:51,602
- Don't you have a post, mister?
- Yes, sir.

451
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:57,189
- Do you mind? I'm starving.
- Dig right in.

452
00:54:57,395 --> 00:55:00,279
Got a fork? Thanks.

453
00:55:01,792 --> 00:55:05,306
Well, we haven't found Rico yet.

454
00:55:05,515 --> 00:55:10,100
He'll have skipped the country by now,
but he'll be back.

455
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:13,711
He has to, you don't walk
away from $1 00 million.

456
00:55:17,319 --> 00:55:20,800
Just how exactly
was Bob involved in this?

457
00:55:22,746 --> 00:55:24,955
He owed us a favour.

458
00:55:29,837 --> 00:55:33,588
Here's the photos Bob took.
They can really stir things up.

459
00:55:33,798 --> 00:55:39,577
Rico blew it when he kidnapped you.
Now we can put him away for keeps.

460
00:55:39,779 --> 00:55:41,435
What now?

461
00:55:41,641 --> 00:55:45,989
The first thing is to put you two
into protective custody.

462
00:55:46,196 --> 00:55:49,520
We go to jail
while Rico walks around free?

463
00:55:49,722 --> 00:55:53,992
No, not jail. We'll hide you away
somewhere safe...

464
00:55:54,198 --> 00:55:56,372
You got any ketchup?

465
00:55:56,575 --> 00:56:00,529
...till we get Rico off the streets.
Guys like that should be...

466
00:56:01,962 --> 00:56:03,741
Building across the street!

467
00:56:04,418 --> 00:56:06,197
Roof, I think. Move it!

468
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:14,310
- Is this what you call safe custody?
- I didn't expect it to start so soon.

469
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:17,482
Maybe you can protect her,
but I know I can.

470
00:56:17,688 --> 00:56:20,617
Not here.
Somewhere I can see 'em coming.

471
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:23,261
What have you got in mind?

472
00:56:26,481 --> 00:56:30,593
You see, the Northern Territory
is wilderness.

473
00:56:32,423 --> 00:56:37,369
Now, if any of you city folk
went out there and got lost,

474
00:56:37,573 --> 00:56:40,817
you would last about three days.

475
00:56:41,019 --> 00:56:46,720
Gosh! And you were out there alone
and wounded for 1 2 days, Mr Reilly?

476
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:50,841
Gator. No, I wasn't really alone,
you see, I...

477
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,924
...I had old Bessie.

478
00:56:56,784 --> 00:56:59,228
And how is old Bessie, Gator?

479
00:56:59,438 --> 00:57:01,612
Mick! You're back!

480
00:57:01,815 --> 00:57:03,437
You're back!

481
00:57:03,637 --> 00:57:05,969
- I missed you.
- I know.

482
00:57:07,321 --> 00:57:09,337
Sue! Sue Charlton.

483
00:57:09,539 --> 00:57:14,327
Here's one of your fellow countrymen,
a brilliant New York journalist.

484
00:57:14,530 --> 00:57:19,274
She's the one that put Walkabout Creek
on the international scene.

485
00:57:19,482 --> 00:57:22,287
Good to see you again, Gator.

486
00:57:22,492 --> 00:57:26,446
- Mick!
- Donk, you old bastard! How are you?

487
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:29,535
G'day, mate!
Bet you've got some stories.

488
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,941
Have I ever, son. But not on a dry throat.

489
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:36,111
- Ida?
- The drinks are on the house.

490
00:57:37,109 --> 00:57:39,046
That's a first!

491
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:45,059
- So what were those New Yorkers like?
- They were a lot like us, Nugget.

492
00:57:45,269 --> 00:57:50,214
In fact, I saw Donk's twin brother
over there, in the Bronx Zoo.

493
00:57:50,418 --> 00:57:54,767
- I don't have a brother.
- In a cage, Donk!

494
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:58,973
- He's still quick.
- Nothing's changed.

495
00:57:59,172 --> 00:58:03,724
- Son of a bitch!
- What's stopping you?

496
00:58:03,926 --> 00:58:07,204
- Here, what's stopping you?
- Donk!

497
00:58:07,412 --> 00:58:09,856
Cheers, Mick!

498
00:58:19,018 --> 00:58:20,719
Luís.

499
00:58:22,108 --> 00:58:23,887
Jefe.

500
00:58:25,395 --> 00:58:27,931
It's like they jumped off the planet.

501
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:31,531
Nobody knows nothing,
not even the Feds.

502
00:58:31,733 --> 00:58:37,828
Somebody knows. Double the price.
The girl's got to die.

503
00:58:38,031 --> 00:58:42,538
But no one touches Dundee.
He's for me.

504
00:59:29,843 --> 00:59:34,868
Mick, this area we're in now,
does it have a name?

505
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,885
Billongamick.

506
00:59:37,092 --> 00:59:41,565
Billongamick...
Does that mean something?

507
00:59:41,767 --> 00:59:43,704
Mick's place.

508
00:59:44,817 --> 00:59:47,543
OK, why does it mean that?

509
00:59:48,421 --> 00:59:51,429
- 'Cause I own it, I guess.
- You own it?

510
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:54,796
Yeah, an uncle of mine
left it to me years ago.

511
00:59:56,106 --> 00:59:58,799
How big is Mick's place?

512
00:59:58,998 --> 01:00:03,583
It's not very big. You could walk
across it in three or four days.

513
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:08,579
Three or four days! You can walk
across New York State in two!

514
01:00:10,089 --> 01:00:15,068
But this is the Territory. Anything under
1,000 square miles is a hobby farm.

515
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:19,278
And Mick's Place, it's all swamps
and rocky mountains.

516
01:00:19,477 --> 01:00:22,800
The only things you can raise here
are mosquitoes.

517
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:27,554
Well, I don't care if it is worthless.
I'm glad it's yours, I love it.

518
01:00:28,984 --> 01:00:33,851
I wouldn't say it's worthless.
It does have some redeeming features.

519
01:00:40,392 --> 01:00:42,802
- Is this what I think it is?
- M-hm.

520
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:46,960
Tomorrow, at my weekender,
I'll show you the Reserve Bank.

521
01:00:47,165 --> 01:00:52,427
That's what I call my mine.
It's like my retirement fund.

522
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:34,729
Hey, Miguel!

523
01:01:36,918 --> 01:01:40,591
It's been a long time, amigo.

524
01:01:47,177 --> 01:01:52,078
You look good, Frank.
This is Mr Rico. He pays the bills.

525
01:01:52,287 --> 01:01:54,856
How're you doin'?

526
01:01:55,060 --> 01:01:59,296
That's Denning. And Erskine in the truck.

527
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,584
They're good men.

528
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:08,763
You didn't have to bring extra help.
We can take care of Dundee.

529
01:02:09,793 --> 01:02:13,596
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

530
01:02:14,824 --> 01:02:18,508
That's Teddy. He's a tracker.

531
01:02:18,706 --> 01:02:23,261
Dundee went bush about a week ago
and Teddy'll help us find him.

532
01:02:23,459 --> 01:02:26,549
The fella you're looking for,
is it Mick Dundee?

533
01:02:26,747 --> 01:02:28,688
Yeah, so what?

534
01:02:34,313 --> 01:02:36,135
For you.

535
01:02:43,146 --> 01:02:45,404
Where's he going?

536
01:02:45,602 --> 01:02:47,622
I don't know.

537
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,554
Denning, bring him back!

538
01:02:52,693 --> 01:02:54,119
Come back!

539
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:12,617
He's gone!

540
01:03:13,330 --> 01:03:15,271
Shit!

541
01:03:16,261 --> 01:03:19,470
- This holds us up?
- No worries.

542
01:03:19,668 --> 01:03:22,797
Maybe a day or two
to get another tracker.

543
01:03:22,995 --> 01:03:24,263
What?

544
01:03:30,007 --> 01:03:33,096
There's a quicker way.

545
01:04:08,588 --> 01:04:11,639
This is the luxury holiday house?

546
01:04:11,837 --> 01:04:13,381
Yeah.

547
01:04:19,125 --> 01:04:22,769
- View's pretty good.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

548
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:25,740
Probably double the value of this place.

549
01:04:25,938 --> 01:04:27,998
That'd be... two...

550
01:04:29,424 --> 01:04:31,999
...three hundred dollars, minimum.

551
01:04:32,870 --> 01:04:36,911
Well... you're the only one
I've ever brought here.

552
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:55,172
I'm so lucky to have a rich man like you.

553
01:05:10,264 --> 01:05:12,205
What is it?

554
01:05:18,265 --> 01:05:21,157
I think you'd better come with me.

555
01:05:46,548 --> 01:05:48,291
Don't...!

556
01:05:50,628 --> 01:05:52,490
Dundee!

557
01:05:53,955 --> 01:05:59,422
I know you're up there.
Come down, or I shoot your friend.

558
01:06:19,426 --> 01:06:22,951
Shoot the dopey bastard!

559
01:06:40,142 --> 01:06:41,529
You shot Walter!

560
01:06:41,727 --> 01:06:44,975
Yeah. It was all I could think of
to save his life.

561
01:06:45,173 --> 01:06:48,580
- By shooting him?
- I only nicked him.

562
01:07:22,368 --> 01:07:27,874
- Now we're all on foot. That's even.
- Seven to two is even?

563
01:07:52,473 --> 01:07:55,801
I thought you two were mates.

564
01:07:55,999 --> 01:07:58,534
So did I.

565
01:08:00,712 --> 01:08:02,931
Garcia, kill him.

566
01:08:24,361 --> 01:08:26,262
Wait.

567
01:08:28,956 --> 01:08:31,926
Why would Dundee want you dead?

568
01:08:36,838 --> 01:08:39,651
You know this country?

569
01:08:41,275 --> 01:08:44,840
Well, of course, you see...

570
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:49,474
That's his backyard, up there.

571
01:08:49,672 --> 01:08:55,297
And no man alive
knows this place better.

572
01:08:55,495 --> 01:08:58,189
Except perhaps me. And so...

573
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:03,774
So he shot his best mate.

574
01:09:04,963 --> 01:09:07,696
What a bastard.

575
01:09:09,756 --> 01:09:12,251
This man thinks like me.

576
01:09:13,281 --> 01:09:15,578
Garcia, let him go.

577
01:09:26,987 --> 01:09:29,482
You stay up front.

578
01:09:29,680 --> 01:09:31,542
Let's go.

579
01:09:58,557 --> 01:10:02,003
There, that's what I'm looking for.

580
01:10:05,172 --> 01:10:07,272
They've found the shack.

581
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:10,361
- Think they'll find us?
- Should do.

582
01:10:10,559 --> 01:10:13,887
I left a trail even Wally could follow.

583
01:10:20,977 --> 01:10:25,295
- Take your bra off.
- This is hardly the time!

584
01:11:21,900 --> 01:11:24,792
Hey! Look at this!

585
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:19,376
You've lost 'em.

586
01:12:19,574 --> 01:12:23,377
- You still know how to shoot.
- Yeah, feels great.

587
01:12:31,696 --> 01:12:34,627
If he moves, kill him.

588
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:56,255
Mick, the gun's empty.
There's no more bullets.

589
01:12:56,453 --> 01:13:00,652
But he doesn't know that.
Not much he can do about it anyway.

590
01:13:00,850 --> 01:13:05,841
- Back soon. I'll check on Wally.
- Do you know where they are?

591
01:13:06,039 --> 01:13:07,346
Yeah.

592
01:13:07,544 --> 01:13:11,624
About 500 yards that way,
behind that ridge.

593
01:13:12,773 --> 01:13:15,625
How do you know that?

594
01:13:15,823 --> 01:13:19,269
Can't you smell it?

595
01:13:19,467 --> 01:13:23,587
- Their sweat?
- Wally's aftershave.

596
01:13:37,926 --> 01:13:40,699
Where are you going?

597
01:13:40,897 --> 01:13:44,700
We're camping.
Do you want coffee or not?

598
01:14:11,754 --> 01:14:14,923
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

599
01:14:22,331 --> 01:14:25,698
- What's happened?
- Crocodile.

600
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:28,312
You're joking.

601
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:32,749
Yeah, it's a croc. Big one.

602
01:14:34,492 --> 01:14:36,274
Sixteen feet.

603
01:14:36,987 --> 01:14:40,433
See where he knelt
to fill his canteen.

604
01:14:40,631 --> 01:14:43,523
You think he was taken by un cocodrilo?

605
01:14:44,909 --> 01:14:48,831
Well, you could put it like that, yes.

606
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,952
Look!

607
01:15:14,935 --> 01:15:17,827
There's nothing we can do here.

608
01:15:21,392 --> 01:15:23,848
You, get some water.

609
01:15:24,046 --> 01:15:26,026
Jose.

610
01:15:26,224 --> 01:15:28,759
Stay with him.

611
01:16:06,351 --> 01:16:09,559
- What's that?
- I'm gonna make a telephone call.

612
01:16:09,757 --> 01:16:14,551
See who's about.
I think we're gonna need some help.

613
01:16:14,749 --> 01:16:19,106
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Would Bonnie say no to Clyde?

614
01:16:19,304 --> 01:16:21,047
Who?

615
01:16:34,515 --> 01:16:37,050
That's the tree.

616
01:16:46,002 --> 01:16:48,418
There's the bats.

617
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:58,321
Fill this up with those berries.
I'll be up on top of the ridge.

618
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:32,122
What the hell is that?

619
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,083
That is the mating call
of the jarra jarra bird.

620
01:18:36,281 --> 01:18:40,559
It's a very large native bird, it's very rare.

621
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:46,184
Meat-eater. Has been known
to take small children away.

622
01:18:46,382 --> 01:18:50,501
But don't worry,
it won't come near the fire.

623
01:19:02,068 --> 01:19:05,079
Thank God you're back.
Did you hear that noise?

624
01:19:05,277 --> 01:19:09,792
- What noise?
- I never heard anything like it.

625
01:19:09,990 --> 01:19:12,011
Wind, maybe.

626
01:19:13,753 --> 01:19:16,566
What's in the bag?

627
01:19:16,764 --> 01:19:19,378
A little present.

628
01:19:41,165 --> 01:19:42,908
Smell.

629
01:19:44,611 --> 01:19:47,582
It stinks! Is it gonna work?

630
01:19:47,780 --> 01:19:52,414
Oh, yeah. To a bat,
this is like that Channel No 5.

631
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,802
I'll be back for dinner.

632
01:19:58,831 --> 01:20:02,159
Keep an eye on the kids.

633
01:20:09,843 --> 01:20:13,250
Listen, boys,
you should be nice for the lady.

634
01:20:13,448 --> 01:20:18,122
She's not here to guard you,
she's here to protect you.

635
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,776
You two aren't the only...

636
01:20:20,974 --> 01:20:23,628
...crawling nasties in this place.

637
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:27,958
Dundee.

638
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:31,760
Tell me about him.

639
01:21:34,771 --> 01:21:40,514
Well, there are bushmen
and there's Mick Dundee.

640
01:21:42,059 --> 01:21:48,041
See, he's more like an Aborigine
than a white man.

641
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,962
He was adopted by Aborigines,

642
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,607
and he had to go through that initiation.

643
01:21:55,805 --> 01:21:59,092
He knows about their magic.

644
01:22:00,637 --> 01:22:02,103
Their...

645
01:22:02,301 --> 01:22:04,836
...black magic.

646
01:22:08,163 --> 01:22:13,036
You know, some people say

647
01:22:13,234 --> 01:22:15,888
that he talks to the animals.

648
01:22:18,898 --> 01:22:21,552
The Aborigines call him...

649
01:22:22,384 --> 01:22:25,989
...Jabajada Arderdah, which means,

650
01:22:26,187 --> 01:22:30,900
"The crocodile who walks like a man".

651
01:22:35,971 --> 01:22:41,754
If what you say is true,
it's lucky we brought the Kryptonite.

652
01:23:04,808 --> 01:23:07,145
Look at that!

653
01:23:58,284 --> 01:24:00,462
Get some sleep.

654
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:06,444
- Gonna be a long day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

655
01:24:06,642 --> 01:24:09,296
Gonna be a long night, too.

656
01:24:31,439 --> 01:24:33,815
Quick hands.

657
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,984
Shit!

658
01:24:40,391 --> 01:24:43,243
- What is it?
- A bloody big snake.

659
01:24:43,441 --> 01:24:45,422
It's a python, you big girl.

660
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:50,373
See how you like it if someone runs
out of the dark and throws one at you.

661
01:24:50,571 --> 01:24:54,849
- Dundee was here, in the camp?
- He ran straight through.

662
01:24:55,047 --> 01:24:57,860
You didn't even get a shot off?

663
01:24:58,969 --> 01:25:01,583
Well, he came out of nowhere.

664
01:25:04,118 --> 01:25:07,168
And he moved like lightning, and...

665
01:25:08,555 --> 01:25:11,169
...and there was no sound.

666
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:14,219
No sound at all.

667
01:25:16,715 --> 01:25:19,448
Dundee's some sort of a ghost
or something.

668
01:25:19,646 --> 01:25:23,290
This Dundee likes to play games, Miguel.

669
01:25:25,231 --> 01:25:29,232
Maybe we'll teach him
some good games when it gets light.

670
01:25:43,809 --> 01:25:46,146
Come on, Jose, get up.

671
01:25:52,840 --> 01:25:56,841
I told you. Black magic.

672
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:01,872
Crap magic.

673
01:26:02,070 --> 01:26:05,199
Sweep the area, and stick together.

674
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:12,726
You!

675
01:26:14,944 --> 01:26:18,192
He didn't fly in here and take Jose.

676
01:26:19,222 --> 01:26:22,470
There must be tracks. Find them.

677
01:26:34,750 --> 01:26:39,424
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- We're headed in the right direction.

678
01:26:39,622 --> 01:26:42,236
- Let's get out.
- You got it.

679
01:27:09,093 --> 01:27:11,668
Jaba Point?

680
01:27:11,866 --> 01:27:15,787
You want me to lead them
to Jaba Point?

681
01:27:17,174 --> 01:27:18,560
Got it.

682
01:27:28,304 --> 01:27:30,760
I got it.

683
01:27:32,345 --> 01:27:33,890
OK.

684
01:27:35,355 --> 01:27:40,861
Well, I think we'd better get the others,
now I know where he's headed.

685
01:27:41,059 --> 01:27:45,536
Jaba Point, because there's
fresh water there and caves.

686
01:27:47,358 --> 01:27:49,497
What makes you so sure?

687
01:27:49,695 --> 01:27:54,092
Because I understand
how the bastard thinks.

688
01:27:54,290 --> 01:27:57,023
I taught him.

689
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:02,529
And now I owe him one.

690
01:28:05,619 --> 01:28:07,678
We'll see.

691
01:28:07,876 --> 01:28:10,610
You stay in front of me...

692
01:28:10,808 --> 01:28:13,739
...bushman.
- OK.

693
01:28:40,635 --> 01:28:44,874
- How are you holding up, soldier?
- Tired. A little scared.

694
01:28:45,072 --> 01:28:48,360
- But I wouldn't have missed it.
- Fun, isn't it?

695
01:28:48,558 --> 01:28:50,499
- Fun?
- Yeah.

696
01:28:55,608 --> 01:29:00,956
Now you can get some sleep.
Relief watch has arrived.

697
01:29:04,085 --> 01:29:06,660
- Charlie, thanks for coming.
- Mick.

698
01:29:06,858 --> 01:29:11,097
- Telephone call.
- Sue, this is Charlie.

699
01:29:11,810 --> 01:29:13,949
And Diamond.

700
01:29:14,147 --> 01:29:20,049
Crikey, you must have a tapeworm!
You've always got food in your hand.

701
01:29:22,227 --> 01:29:24,485
We've been here since first light.

702
01:29:24,683 --> 01:29:28,565
The two brothers are over there,
looking out for the others.

703
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:31,734
Watch this lot. I'll go after Wally.

704
01:29:31,932 --> 01:29:34,032
OK, mate.

705
01:29:38,389 --> 01:29:42,390
- Can I help?
- I really wanted to get ahead of Wally.

706
01:29:42,588 --> 01:29:46,311
I know, a sheila would
only slow you down.

707
01:29:48,252 --> 01:29:51,699
Be careful. This isn't a game.

708
01:29:51,897 --> 01:29:54,551
It is to me.

709
01:30:14,515 --> 01:30:17,406
No, mate. We just hold them.

710
01:30:20,060 --> 01:30:22,754
What did he say?

711
01:30:22,952 --> 01:30:27,270
He wants to know
if we're allowed to eat these men.

712
01:30:45,808 --> 01:30:50,443
We made the right decision, mate.
Stuff the money.

713
01:30:50,641 --> 01:30:56,345
Yeah, I've had a bad feeling about this
since that old black tracker walked off.

714
01:30:56,543 --> 01:31:01,058
You know, I thought that greaser
really did turn into a goanna.

715
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:05,931
Erskine?

716
01:31:13,338 --> 01:31:16,428
Don't fool around. Erskine!

717
01:31:36,828 --> 01:31:39,878
He's headed for Jaba Point,
that's for sure.

718
01:31:40,076 --> 01:31:44,433
We cross here.
You lead the way, we'll cover you.

719
01:31:44,631 --> 01:31:46,176
Yeah.

720
01:32:25,590 --> 01:32:28,283
We don't need him now, anyway.

721
01:32:28,481 --> 01:32:31,809
He's already shown us
the way to Jaba Point.

722
01:32:33,868 --> 01:32:36,522
We'll cross over here.

723
01:32:51,218 --> 01:32:53,555
I knew it was you all the time.

724
01:32:53,753 --> 01:32:56,804
First you shoot me,
now you try to drown me.

725
01:32:57,002 --> 01:33:01,200
- You've been hit.
- It's only a scratch, mate.

726
01:33:01,399 --> 01:33:04,290
Careful, there might be
real crocs down there.

727
01:33:04,488 --> 01:33:07,221
Where do you think I got this fellow?

728
01:33:07,419 --> 01:33:09,400
In here.

729
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:15,302
- Should have seen your face.
- What about it?

730
01:33:15,500 --> 01:33:18,035
- You shit yourself.
- I did not!

731
01:33:18,233 --> 01:33:20,372
- You didn't know it was me.
- I did!

732
01:33:36,653 --> 01:33:38,713
G'day. Want a cold one?

733
01:33:38,911 --> 01:33:41,961
- Who the hell are you?
- Nugget.

734
01:33:42,159 --> 01:33:44,654
I've been looking for Walter Reilly.

735
01:33:45,962 --> 01:33:48,853
Haven't seen him around, have you?

736
01:33:49,051 --> 01:33:51,864
You should have brought a gun
instead of beer.

737
01:33:52,062 --> 01:33:55,865
No, I don't need a gun. I've got a Donk.

738
01:33:59,865 --> 01:34:02,361
You've got a what?

739
01:34:03,945 --> 01:34:05,649
Donk.

740
01:34:24,702 --> 01:34:27,514
Walter! Over here!

741
01:34:27,712 --> 01:34:32,624
There you are! I was just
making sure nobody followed me.

742
01:34:32,822 --> 01:34:36,070
- How d'you get away?
- It was a piece of cake.

743
01:34:36,268 --> 01:34:41,220
It was just a question of timing,
'cause Mick and I had this plan.

744
01:34:41,418 --> 01:34:43,082
- You were shot.
- No, Mick.

745
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,884
- What!
- He's all right. It's just a scratch.

746
01:34:47,082 --> 01:34:51,638
- Where is he?
- He's leading those two to Jaba Point.

747
01:34:51,836 --> 01:34:54,925
That's mountain goat country, so...

748
01:34:55,123 --> 01:34:59,045
...he's gonna have a picnic
with those two!

749
01:35:00,946 --> 01:35:03,204
What are you doing? Mick said wait.

750
01:35:03,402 --> 01:35:06,650
Mick thinks it's a game.
Rico's no picnic.

751
01:35:06,849 --> 01:35:09,146
Which way is it?

752
01:35:11,562 --> 01:35:14,533
Well, I'll have to go with you.

753
01:35:25,228 --> 01:35:28,001
Are you really enjoying that?

754
01:35:30,615 --> 01:35:33,507
Nah. Needs garlic.

755
01:36:10,267 --> 01:36:14,228
It's time we stopped playing
this bushman's game his way.

756
01:36:14,426 --> 01:36:16,763
What do you mean?

757
01:36:19,417 --> 01:36:23,853
This man can take us
any time he wants to.

758
01:36:24,052 --> 01:36:26,032
No.

759
01:36:26,230 --> 01:36:29,280
Now we finish it. Think!

760
01:36:29,478 --> 01:36:32,013
When we were children,

761
01:36:32,212 --> 01:36:36,133
did you chase a snake
into the cane fields?

762
01:36:39,183 --> 01:36:41,520
Move to those rocks and wait.

763
01:38:38,652 --> 01:38:40,593
G'day, amigo.

764
01:38:49,981 --> 01:38:52,595
Take your pants off.

765
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:36,326
He's got Mick!

766
01:40:36,179 --> 01:40:41,091
If Mick wants his clothes back,
he can climb down himself.

767
01:40:42,359 --> 01:40:43,943
What?

768
01:40:47,825 --> 01:40:50,242
Mick's clothes.

769
01:40:50,440 --> 01:40:54,084
We swapped with that bastard,
to flush the other one out.

770
01:40:54,282 --> 01:40:58,045
Plan was working
till you turned up and shot Mick.

771
01:41:03,947 --> 01:41:06,839
That's... not Mick?

772
01:41:09,295 --> 01:41:12,543
Course not. There's Mick over there.

773
01:41:40,192 --> 01:41:44,113
Mick's bloody lucky
you can't shoot straight.

774
01:41:51,600 --> 01:41:55,759
- You ready to go home now?
- I am home.
