1
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,713
You in the dinghy! This is the police.

2
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,884
Put your hands on your head.

3
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,353
Mick?

4
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,523
G'day, Sarge!

5
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,692
I might have known it would be you.

6
00:01:51,653 --> 00:01:54,530
It's these New York fish, Sarge,
they won't take the bait.

7
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,498
Breakfast.

8
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,461
Get outta here! Come on, let's go.

9
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,292
Mick?

10
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,678
Breakfast.

11
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,142
What are you doing up there?
You scared me.

12
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,978
Just admiring the view.
You want coffee?

13
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,813
Yeah.

14
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:21,510
- Are you thinking about home?
- Yeah.

15
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:24,721
- I guess you miss it.
- The bush? A bit.

16
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,393
I was thinking I could be sitting in
the bar at Walkabout Creek right now,

17
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,521
gazing across at Wally
and Nugget and Donk.

18
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:38,068
Or I could be here looking at you.
No contest.

19
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,406
Actually, I was thinking
about looking for a job.

20
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,907
You're kidding.

21
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:47,202
No. A man can't stay
on holidays forever.

22
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:51,290
Well, you seem to have
managed okay so far.

23
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,961
I would've started looking for a job
last week,

24
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,548
only I wanted to see Doug meet
his mysterious twin brother.

25
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:03,176
- Doug who?
- On TV. Days of Our Lives.

26
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,597
Mick! We definitely have to
get you a job!

27
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:18,734
Hey, Mick, my friend didn't see
you throw. Could you show him?

28
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,654
You can go play. I've got to go to work.

29
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,947
Play?

30
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,076
- Don't forget lunch.
- No worries. All right. Wait a minute.

31
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,578
- Where's the rabbit?
- Here it is.

32
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,121
Yeah. Right. That's a rabbit.

33
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:33,415
You take the rabbit,
put it down over there somewhere

34
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,833
- then get right out of the way.
- Okay.

35
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:36,335
- Rocks?
- Yup.

36
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,961
Don't miss, Mick.

37
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,924
- Close your eyes!
- All right.

38
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,010
One.

39
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,096
Two.

40
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,806
Three.

41
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,309
Four. Okay, you can look.

42
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,109
- Any good?
- That was the best, Mick.

43
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,195
Know how come he can throw like that?

44
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:06,615
In the bushes, if you miss, you don't eat.
Isn't that right, Mick?

45
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:10,952
That's right. But that's only half of it.
First, you gotta find the animals.

46
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,246
Here. What's this?

47
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,626
- A snake. That's a snake trail.
- Quick.

48
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,045
Snakes are good eating.

49
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,089
What's this one?

50
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:30,055
- That's a goanna, a real big lizard.
- Right.

51
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:33,392
You can eat it,
but it tastes like shit, right, Mick?

52
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:37,062
Yeah... Here's another one, real quick.

53
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,942
What's that? Don't know?

54
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,737
Dunlop radials, Tony's bike.

55
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,699
- That was a good one.
- All right, practice.

56
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,326
- Bye, Mick. Bye.
- See you later. Bye-bye.

57
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,161
- See you later!
- Bye!

58
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,581
- And don't forget lunch!
- That was good, right?

59
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,923
- G'day, Al.
- Hiya, Mick.

60
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,009
- What'll you have?
- Just a beer, mate.

61
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:13,682
- Mind if I make an announcement?
- Go right ahead.

62
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,809
Thanks.

63
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,896
Mick Dundee's the name.
Fairly new in town.

64
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,440
Looking for some kind of a job.

65
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,317
Any suggestions?

66
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,198
That's enough job hunting for one day.

67
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,909
- Yo, Mick, my man!
- G'day, Leroy.

68
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:37,581
- So, like, you're looking for work?
- Kinda.

69
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,208
Well, then look no further.

70
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,920
- I can get you into something sweet.
- Great.

71
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,882
Let me just grab some cigarettes,
then we'll talk some business.

72
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:47,966
Okay.

73
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,095
Hey.

74
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,432
I noticed you're getting
pretty tight with Leroy.

75
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,600
Yeah, nice fella.

76
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,811
Let me warn you, he's a bad dude.

77
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,898
He's into some pretty heavy shit.

78
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:06,610
- Leroy? Seems harmless enough.
- Just so you know.

79
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:12,657
Yo, Mick, let's walk.
Less ears on the street.

80
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,911
Okay. Back in a sec.

81
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:32,135
Okay, like... I got a little
supply business going, right?

82
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:37,057
- Hey, like you will work for me.
- What would I be doing?

83
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,393
- Delivering stuff.
- Stuff?

84
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,865
This is just between you and me.
This goes no further, right?

85
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,242
Right.

86
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:02,874
Stationery.

87
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,210
Stationery?

88
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:12,217
You know,
pens, erasers, office supplies.

89
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:17,973
- And that's heavy shit?
- No, man, it ain't.

90
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,308
I'm strictly legit.

91
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,853
But when you have
a name like Leroy Brown,

92
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:26,314
people expect you to be bad.

93
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,149
You know, like the song.

94
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,151
Right!

95
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,320
But...

96
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:36,116
- I kinda like the image.
- Yeah.

97
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,452
- You dig?
- Yup. Dig.

98
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:42,539
Is that part of the job? Digging?

99
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:48,336
Man, you really are prehistoric.
Hey. You want the job?

100
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,881
Well, I don't know, Leroy.
Don't really know what I wanna do yet.

101
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:56,011
Okay. When you make up your mind,
you let me know.

102
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,263
Okay.

103
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,349
In the meantime,

104
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,185
I gotta split.

105
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,566
You be cool.

106
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,762
Beast. The perfect gift for Donk.

107
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:54,903
Well, it makes a man irresistible.

108
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,408
You don't sound very convincing.
I think I'll test it.

109
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,348
Doesn't work.

110
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,725
Well, it doesn't!

111
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,692
I'd really like to get Wally
the kind of thing

112
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:36,069
you can only buy in America, you know.

113
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,279
Hello.

114
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:44,828
Maybe like those cushions
that say, "I love New York,"

115
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,871
that you put in your car.

116
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:05,682
Hi, Sue. What are you doing?

117
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,811
Hi, Doris. Nothing exciting,
just going through some mail.

118
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:17,193
- Bob Tanner. Isn't he your ex-husband?
- We still keep in touch.

119
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,989
Sue, he's cute!
Where was I when you two broke up?

120
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:25,493
- I could have consoled him!
- Well, that's gonna be difficult.

121
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,913
He spends most of his time
in Colombia these days.

122
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,166
That's where the action is.

123
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:36,379
Qué será, será. Speaking of action,
when am I gonna meet Tarzan?

124
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:40,091
- You mean Mick?
- You have another hot jungle lover?

125
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,342
Soon, I promise.

126
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:45,680
Sue, what's he like in bed?

127
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,350
I don't know. He still sleeps on the floor.

128
00:12:58,402 --> 00:13:00,361
Okay, some visitors.

129
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,166
This must be Rico.

130
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,715
Hello, Rico. Nice suit.

131
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,058
A little slimy, you know.

132
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,231
What the hell is this?

133
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,154
Shit!

134
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:49,721
- Operador.
- Hi. This is SeñorTanner in Room 11.

135
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,639
Would you get me

136
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,725
Bogotá 6-3-7, please?

137
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,404
- Hello.
- Your call.

138
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,615
Brannigan.

139
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,408
Brannigan. Look,
something's happened.

140
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,202
You gotta get me out of here.
I'm not a cop. I want protection.

141
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,997
Okay, Tanner, you'll get it.
Just calm down.

142
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:18,458
So, what have you got?

143
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,463
Rico was at the cocaine plant.

144
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,174
Yeah, it was him.

145
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,551
And there's more.
He killed a guy, personally.

146
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,053
I took pictures of the whole thing.

147
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,348
Great. Did you send them off?

148
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,516
Yeah, but not to you.

149
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,102
But don't worry,
I'll send you some framed copies.

150
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:40,021
Where did you send them, Bob?

151
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,773
Yeah, Brannigan. Sure, yeah.

152
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,608
I tell you, and you kiss me goodbye.

153
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,109
Read my lips. They shot at me!

154
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,236
They already killed one guy!
Now come here and get me!

155
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:49,280
Yeah. Okay, okay, just stay put.

156
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,532
We'll be there within the hour.
You'll be out on the next flight.

157
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,911
- Great. Good. Great.
- You did a greatjob.

158
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,539
Thank you very much. Bye.
Just come and get me, all right?

159
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:04,420
- Operador.
- Yeah. Hi, it's me again. Yeah.

160
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:06,798
Would you get me
New York City, please?

161
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,884
212-555-6432.

162
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,886
- Sí, señor. Nueva York.
- Thank you.

163
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,907
Sue, listen...

164
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,871
Hello. This is Mick Dundee here.

165
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:42,917
I'm not really here, this is a recording.
It's good, isn't it?

166
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,669
Sue's not here either,

167
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,964
and you should leave a message
after the beep.

168
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,510
Hey, great message.
Listen, Sue, this is Robert.

169
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:55,638
I just... I sent you a letter.
I don't want you to open it.

170
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:58,558
I don't want you to do anything with it
until you hear from me, all right?

171
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:02,979
There's nobody else that I trust.
This is big with a capital "B."

172
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,481
Bye.

173
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,926
- G'day, Ralph.
- Yo, Mickey. How's it hangin'?

174
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,553
Good, mate. Anything for me?

175
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,014
Got something here for your lady friend.

176
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,641
There you go.

177
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,812
Hey.

178
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,315
What about this one?

179
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:53,571
My fellow Americans,
let me make one thing perfectly clear.

180
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,660
That's funny, Ralph. Who is it?

181
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,291
It's Nixon! You know, Tricky Dicky?

182
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:09,087
No, I don't know him.
Does he live round here?

183
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,049
He used to be the President!

184
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,845
Oh, right.
Yeah, that was just like him, Ralph.

185
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,515
- I'll work on it.
- See you, mate.

186
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,433
See you later, Mick.

187
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,915
Hey, you ugly mother.
Give me your wallet!

188
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,751
Hey, hey, hey. Relax! It's just me, man.

189
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,920
- Leroy! How are you, mate?
- How you doin'?

190
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,840
- Fancy a drink somewhere?
- That sounds good to me.

191
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,633
I just got a couple of deliveries to make.

192
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,510
- Can I help?
- Sure, sure.

193
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,513
Look, this goes to
Moore, Bank and Patterson,

194
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:03,266
on the 23rd floor
of that building right there.

195
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,809
No worries. See you back here.

196
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,936
- Back here in five minutes.
- Got it.

197
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,736
- G'day.
- Yes.

198
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,030
Can I help you?

199
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,033
That's your stationery.

200
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,161
Can you wait while I check this?

201
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:26,414
Yeah, sure.

202
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,135
Hey, there's a guy
walking past your window.

203
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,764
- Okay, what's the gag?
- No, serious.

204
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:49,437
Oh, my God. It's a jumper.
I'd better call the police.

205
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:53,482
- It's a what?
- A jumper. A suicide!

206
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:58,112
Maybe I should go and talk to him.

207
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,790
Don't try to stop me.

208
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,127
I don't want to stop you.
I just wanna get past.

209
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,629
What?

210
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:19,467
- I wanna get by. You're in the way.
- You're kidding.

211
00:20:20,135 --> 00:20:22,637
No. I walk around here every day.

212
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,430
Get away from
all the noise and the traffic,

213
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,307
get up here and get the fresh air.

214
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,017
You had the same idea yourself,
did you?

215
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,896
I don't give a damn about the air!

216
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,106
I'm about to
throw myself off this building.

217
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,656
You could kill yourself.

218
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,200
That's the whole idea.

219
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,789
Right. I'll just wait till you're finished.

220
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:10,101
Would you mind getting a move on?
I'm on my lunch break.

221
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,604
I can't do it with you watching.

222
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,024
Sorry.

223
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,702
Just out of curiosity, why...

224
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:43,801
Have you ever been hopelessly
and completely in love,

225
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,013
only to find out that...

226
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,223
That you've been used?

227
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,727
No, I can't say that I have.

228
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,940
I loved that bitch!

229
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,529
- It's all right.
- And he betrayed me.

230
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:05,156
He?

231
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,039
Screw that!

232
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:51,369
Hello, Sue.

233
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,747
No, no. No trouble, darling.
Just get into the car, okay?

234
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,953
Sit.

235
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,400
Sue Charlton.

236
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,487
You got something for me?

237
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:52,907
Who are you and what do you want?

238
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,243
Forgive me. I am Luis Rico.

239
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:02,458
Your ex-husband Bob sent you a film.
It belongs to me. I want it back.

240
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:05,753
Bob?
I don't know what you're talking about.

241
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:10,466
This is very simple.
We do business and you go home.

242
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,224
He sent you a letter. Where is it?

243
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,394
I don't know what you're talking about.

244
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,400
It would be here by now.
He left a message on your machine.

245
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,154
I never got any message.
The machine's been broken.

246
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,125
Felipe.

247
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,337
He says the boyfriend is back.

248
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,966
What do you want him to do?

249
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,221
- His name?
- Mick.

250
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:00,808
He lives with you?

251
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,188
- Does he check the mail?
- Yeah, I guess.

252
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,822
Tell Felipe to bring Mick
around for a coffee.

253
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:23,581
He says that the DEA,
they staked out the place.

254
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,459
Brannigan just
walked inside the building.

255
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:37,428
Tell him to just sit tight.
This is getting out of hand.

256
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:54,028
Call Mick. And pray he has some brains.

257
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,032
He does like I tell him,
you both come out alive.

258
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:14,923
Sue?

259
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,152
Just a second.

260
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:39,031
- Yeah?
- Mick.

261
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,366
Sue. You should see the joint...

262
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,077
Mick, listen, this is really important.
I'm in a lot of trouble.

263
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,871
- Did you check the mail today?
- Yeah, why?

264
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:50,084
Was there a letter for me
from Colombia?

265
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:55,756
Hang on a second. Colombia.
Yeah, I got it here.

266
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,426
- Thank God.
- What the hell's going on?

267
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:02,221
- Mick, I'm being held prisoner by...
- You're joking, right?

268
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,597
Shut up and listen.

269
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,724
- Who's this?
- There's no time.

270
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,518
There's a cop coming to see you.

271
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,605
Give him nothing. Get rid of him,
or your lady is a dead woman.

272
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,565
Call you back in two minutes.

273
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,151
Listen...

274
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,416
Yeah?

275
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,127
Inspector Brannigan.
Drug Enforcement Administration.

276
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:37,256
- Is Sue Charlton in?
- Not at the moment, no.

277
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,303
- When do you expect her?
- I'm not sure.

278
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,974
You know these big-time reporters,
out reporting till all hours.

279
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,812
Would you ask her to give me a call,
if you happen to bump into her?

280
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,480
Yeah, sure. No problem.

281
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,149
Aren't you gonna ask me
what this is all about?

282
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:57,484
Well, none of my business.

283
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,319
Okay, fine.

284
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,332
Yes?

285
00:29:12,876 --> 00:29:16,503
Bring the letter to Hoyt Street station,
downtown side.

286
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,339
Wait till someone comes. You got that?

287
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,009
Yes. I wanna talk to Sue. Now.

288
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,138
Mick, please do what they say
and be careful.

289
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,098
You just hang on.

290
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,142
One thing more, amigo.

291
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,979
If you're followed, if you screw this up,

292
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,192
your lady is dead. Comprendes?

293
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:40,861
Yeah, I got it.

294
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,592
- What you want? A little mustard?
- Yeah.

295
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,720
Ketchup?

296
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:43,483
Okay, here she is.

297
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,612
Mom?

298
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,340
- Finished?
- What?

299
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,175
Are you finished?

300
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,010
Don't put it away.

301
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,930
- Put your hands up on the wall.
- Okay.

302
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,724
Now, where's Sue Charlton?

303
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,559
Who's that?

304
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,605
Lord! Man, no!

305
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,274
Look, look, look.
How should I know where she is?

306
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,525
I've been following you.

307
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,986
Brannigan told me to follow you.
And that's it.

308
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,739
- Brannigan. So you're a cop?
- Yeah, DEA.

309
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,700
- Look. Can I do up my fly now?
- No.

310
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,078
- All right.
- What do you want with Sue?

311
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:39,373
Pictures. We think she's got

312
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:43,460
photographs, pictures of a guy
named Rico. It's evidence, you know.

313
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,047
- Who's Rico?
- A big-time drug dealer, he's a killer.

314
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,632
Where is he? Where does he live?

315
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:50,342
Wherever he wants to.
How should I know?

316
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:52,302
Look, I think I've been
more than reasonable

317
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,179
under the circumstances,
so what do you say...

318
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:59,643
What do you say you and me just forget
this little incident ever took place, okay?

319
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:03,271
'Cause it's kind of embarrassing,
you know?

320
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:06,400
He's gone.

321
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,783
Are you okay, buddy?

322
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:18,078
Okay.

323
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,068
You gotta be Dundee.

324
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:55,115
- Where's the girl?
- Coming in on the next train.

325
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,538
- The item?
- We'll wait.

326
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,076
She must have got off at the wrong stop.

327
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,371
No, no, no...

328
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,044
Keep going.

329
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:56,843
Now, that's a knife.

330
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,431
This is the legendary
New York City subway,

331
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:03,558
completed in nineteen hundred and...

332
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:07,229
It's the most extensive
subway system in the world,

333
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:11,983
encompassing 481.2 rail miles.

334
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,237
Yous is free to take pictures.

335
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:17,364
Please get on the train
in an orderly fashion.

336
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,616
The next stop will be City Hall.

337
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,452
And then on to Staten Island Ferry,

338
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,996
which provides service to
World Trade Center.

339
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,249
No, no. Go on. Go on.

340
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,210
Yeah.

341
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:36,758
How does this work?

342
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:39,761
Oh, my God! He's got a gun!

343
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,597
He'll kill somebody, he's crazy!

344
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:45,600
Where are you going? Come back here!
He has a gun!

345
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:47,894
I'm gonna get into trouble!

346
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,184
Shit.

347
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,529
- Thank you.
- Slap me five.

348
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:45,785
You know who that was?
Clint Eastwood!

349
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,412
Clint Eastwood?

350
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,458
Yes, very tall.

351
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,668
So is I.

352
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,713
Yes.

353
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,966
Clint Eastwood.

354
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:06,806
You know what this is?

355
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,434
Cocaine.

356
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,520
Wrong. It's money and power.

357
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,317
With this, you can do
anything to anybody.

358
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:21,988
Five, 10 years from now,

359
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,992
I'm gonna retire,
buy myself a little island.

360
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,286
Hawaii, maybe.

361
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,588
Who do you think you are?

362
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:42,592
You hold me here at gunpoint
and threaten to kill people

363
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:45,220
and then you act like
you're some sort of a rock star?

364
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:48,265
You're a drug dealer.

365
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,601
Grubby little parasite.

366
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,857
You should watch your mouth.

367
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,487
It's not wise to annoy me.

368
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:08,702
Bob Tanner did
and I had his head blown off, like that.

369
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,204
You killed Bob?

370
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,040
And if your Mick screws this up...

371
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,545
Wakey, wakey.

372
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:53,848
You kill people for a living.
Not very good at it, are you?

373
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,017
Maybe you should
get into some other business.

374
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,143
Shove it!

375
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,521
You're too heavy to be a clever dick.

376
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,481
Who do you think you're kidding?
You ain't gonna...

377
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:07,445
Scary, eh?

378
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,539
Please! What do you want?

379
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,171
Please! What do you want?

380
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:32,804
- Where's the girl?
- Rico's got her. At his place.

381
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,433
And where exactly is that?

382
00:40:56,078 --> 00:40:59,372
Thank God! I thought
you were gonna leave me here.

383
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:04,043
- Long Island. That's east of here, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

384
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,297
- Thanks.
- Hey!

385
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,841
Hey!

386
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:16,556
Freeze! Hold it!

387
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,486
Excuse me.

388
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,495
Shall I go after him?

389
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,915
- Be my guest.
- Yeah.

390
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:59,098
Mick, this is serious shit
you're talking about.

391
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,603
DEA, international drug rings...

392
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:06,773
This is all hazardous to your health.

393
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,277
Yeah, but think what it'll do
for your reputation.

394
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,029
Oh, yeah! Yeah.

395
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:17,325
Leroy Brown, the baddest man
in the whole damn cemetery!

396
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,122
Yeah, but I don't understand
how these people think.

397
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,167
I need someone who's road wise.

398
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,963
Road wise.

399
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:40,390
Let's go.

400
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,894
The car's...
I mean, like, the wheels are out back.

401
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,689
I'm cool.

402
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,525
I'm cool.

403
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,048
You mustn't let these minor disruptions
ruin your appetite.

404
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:19,387
Try the lobster. I had it flown in
from Maine this morning.

405
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,474
There's nothing wrong with the food,
it's the company.

406
00:43:41,368 --> 00:43:44,370
Would you look at this stuff!

407
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:48,041
There's TV cameras,

408
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,002
infrared beams!

409
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,548
They're gonna know you're there
before you do.

410
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,720
Maybe we should just call the police.

411
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,014
Mick.

412
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,893
Guys like this own cops.

413
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:12,357
And even if the guys you call
are straight, what are they gonna do?

414
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,943
Come in here with their sirens wailing
and their guns blazing?

415
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:19,322
She'll be dead in two seconds,
if she's still alive.

416
00:44:26,538 --> 00:44:28,164
She's still alive.

417
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:31,709
How do you know that?

418
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,755
'Cause that's the only way I can see her.
Up here.

419
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:42,929
If I even start to think she's hurt,
my guts twist up, I can't think straight,

420
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:45,056
and I'm no good to her.

421
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:10,832
- So, what do we do now?
- We need some kind of distraction.

422
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:36,524
When we get in, Mick, whatever you do,
be cool, go easy. These dogs bite.

423
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,862
Fortunately,
they know my rep round here.

424
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:43,239
I'll just smooth the way.

425
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:08,931
- Yo, Rat.
- Leroy.

426
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:14,520
I would consider it a personal favor
if you'll hear my man here.

427
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,445
- You're the crocodile man, ain't you?
- Yeah.

428
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,573
I've seen you around.

429
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:31,454
- I'm Rat.
- Hey, Rat.

430
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,374
What do you want, crocodile man?

431
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,377
I've got a problem. I need your help.

432
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,547
Well, you've come to the right place.

433
00:46:42,257 --> 00:46:44,342
That's what we're here for, huh?

434
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,426
Yeah.

435
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:48,012
Nice jacket.

436
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,767
How can we be of service?

437
00:47:05,113 --> 00:47:09,408
Well, these heavy dudes
kidnapped my woman.

438
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,119
They're holding her prisoner
in a big mansion

439
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:13,663
and I'm gonna bust her out.

440
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,040
"Heavy dudes," huh?

441
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:19,919
Lots of guys with machine guns,
shit like that?

442
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:22,755
Probably.

443
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:26,592
So, you want us
to charge down the guns, huh?

444
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,804
Death before dishonor, all that stuff?

445
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,097
No.

446
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,849
I'm the only one that's gonna get shot at.

447
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:38,479
What I want from you is a distraction,
so I can get in.

448
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,359
So, what's in it for us?

449
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:49,198
Leroy tells me that your gang
is the coolest gang in New York.

450
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,283
That's right.

451
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,451
That's the word.

452
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:59,542
- What did you do last night?
- We didn't do nothin'.

453
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:04,255
We was here all night.

454
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,928
That's what you call cool, is it?

455
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:20,396
So tomorrow,
if someone asks you the same question,

456
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,982
you can say, "We didn't do nothin'."

457
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:27,194
Or you can say,
"We went out to Long Island

458
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,822
"and helped this lunatic
storm a fortress. "

459
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:42,793
At the very least you could come
and watch me get my head blown off.

460
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,087
What are your chances?

461
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,382
Fair.

462
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,844
What are your chances of getting
outta here with that jacket on?

463
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,689
Better than average.

464
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:11,072
Yeah, I'll go along with that.

465
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,374
He wants to drive, let him drive!

466
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:25,169
- I didn't think you'd get anybody.
- Would you miss this?

467
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,964
- No.
- Exactly.

468
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:32,385
Hey, yo! Like, be cool with the clutch!

469
00:49:37,057 --> 00:49:38,891
Hey, Judy, what's going on?

470
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,895
Looks like these guys are gonna
blow up Long Island or something.

471
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:46,816
- What the hell, let's check it out!
- Yeah, let's go, man!

472
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,279
Go!

473
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,095
Okay, Kemo Sabe. We're set.

474
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,098
It's time for you to do
your Lone Ranger stuff.

475
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,600
Thanks, Rat.

476
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,024
Souvenir.

477
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,598
Good luck, Mick.

478
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:08,481
Hey, Miguel, there is something
going on outside, man.

479
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,941
There is all this weird howling.

480
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,536
They're only kids, punks.
Go get rid of them.

481
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:27,833
Don't start shooting at shadows.
We don't want the cops around.

482
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,836
Do we?

483
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:02,993
Shit.

484
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,996
They don't even have
machine guns, man.

485
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,843
Yeah, like, he's cool.

486
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,813
That's my man!

487
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,774
What's happening here?

488
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,944
What's going on here?

489
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:24,366
- I'm in. I'm in. What are we doing?
- What are you, a penguin?

490
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,327
Who are these people?

491
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,078
There he goes.

492
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,460
Damn! He's going in!

493
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,879
Hey. He's going in!

494
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,339
All right!

495
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,180
- What's happening?
- Just some punk kids.

496
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:31,558
- They set off the alarm.
- Check the house anyway.

497
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,781
Mick.

498
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,442
- Leroy!
- Hey, Mick!

499
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:06,653
Thought you might need a hand.

500
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:09,948
It looks like
you've already taken care of business.

501
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,909
Check out this party!

502
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:16,747
It don't fit.

503
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,294
Where did all these people come from?

504
00:56:22,379 --> 00:56:24,713
Hey, Leroy.
You throw a great party, man.

505
00:56:25,298 --> 00:56:28,300
Better ask Leroy.
He's in charge of the cavalry.

506
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:32,429
It's like, curiosity, my man.

507
00:56:32,847 --> 00:56:35,474
Like, the word gets around,

508
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,895
that bad, bad Leroy Brown
got something going down,

509
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:43,482
they can't stay away.
I mean, with my reputation...

510
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,946
Mick, I gotta split.

511
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:52,074
Looks like explanation time.

512
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,250
How do you like your eggs, mate?

513
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,294
Over easy. Thanks, Mick.

514
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,437
- Morning, Miss Charlton.
- Morning.

515
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:25,065
I was assigned to guard your door.
Mick invited me in.

516
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,831
- Morning.
- G'day.

517
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:43,208
Don't you have a post, mister?

518
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,878
Yes, sir.

519
00:57:47,338 --> 00:57:49,381
Do you mind? I'm starving.

520
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,758
Dig right in.

521
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,636
Got a fork? Thanks.

522
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,224
Well, we haven't found Rico yet.

523
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:02,186
He'll have skipped the country by now,

524
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,397
but he'll be back.

525
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:09,151
He has to, you don't walk
away from a $100-million business.

526
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,449
Just how exactly
was Bob involved in this?

527
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,996
He owed us a favor.

528
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:27,628
Here's the photos Bob took.

529
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:30,172
We can really stir things up with these.

530
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,382
Rico blew it when he kidnapped you.

531
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,427
With your help
we can put him away for keeps.

532
00:58:36,596 --> 00:58:38,388
So what happens now?

533
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:41,683
The first thing is to put you two
into protective custody.

534
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:46,897
So we go to jail
while Rico walks around free?

535
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:51,610
No. No, not jail.
We'll hide you away somewhere safe.

536
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,529
You got any ketchup?

537
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,365
Till we get Rico off the streets.

538
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,742
Guys like that should be
just taken out and shot.

539
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:00,994
Building across the street!

540
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,456
Roof, I think. Go, go! Move it!

541
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:12,339
- Is this what you call safe custody?
- I didn't expect it to start so soon.

542
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:16,301
Yeah, well, maybe you can protect her,
but I know I can.

543
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,638
But not here.
Somewhere I can see 'em coming.

544
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:21,848
What have you got in mind?

545
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:29,022
You see, the Northern Territory
is wilderness.

546
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:36,446
Now, if any of you city folk
went out there and got lost,

547
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,867
you would last about three days.

548
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,327
Gosh!

549
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:47,291
And you mean you were out there alone
and wounded for 12 days, Mr. Reilly?

550
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:51,003
- Gator.
- No, I wasn't really alone, you see, I...

551
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,463
I had old Bessie.

552
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,803
And how is old Bessie, Gator?

553
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,806
Mick! You're back!

554
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,141
You're back!

555
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:07,352
- I missed you. I missed you.
- I know.

556
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,981
Sue! Sue Charlton.

557
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:13,442
Now, here's another one of
your fellow countrymen.

558
01:00:13,526 --> 01:00:16,194
She's a brilliant New York journalist.

559
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:21,366
She was the one that put Walkabout
Creek on the international scene.

560
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:24,244
Good to see you again, Gator.

561
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:28,915
- Mick! You old bastard!
- Donk! How are you?

562
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,252
G'day, mate!
Bet you've got some stories to tell, eh?

563
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:35,756
Have I ever, son. Have I ever.
But not on a dry throat.

564
01:00:35,923 --> 01:00:38,634
- Ida?
- The drinks are on the house.

565
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:41,762
That's a first!

566
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:45,474
So what were
those New Yorkers like, Mick?

567
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,769
They were a lot like us, Nugget.
A lot like us.

568
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:52,773
In fact, I saw Donk's twin brother
over there, in New York,

569
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:54,066
in the Bronx Zoo.

570
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:56,068
I don't have a brother.

571
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,362
In a cage, Donk!

572
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:03,158
- He's still quick, eh?
- Nothing's changed.

573
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:05,619
Son of a bitch!

574
01:01:05,703 --> 01:01:07,537
What's stopping you?

575
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,333
- Hey, what's stopping you?
- Donk!

576
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:13,794
- Cheers, Mick!
- Great to see you, again.

577
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,514
Luis.

578
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,684
Jefe.

579
01:01:31,229 --> 01:01:33,230
It's like they jumped off
the face of the planet.

580
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,817
Nobody knows nothing,
not even the Feds.

581
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:39,945
Somebody knows.

582
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:43,615
Double the price. The girl's got to die.

583
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,328
But no one touches Dundee.
He's for me.

584
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:42,507
Mick, this area we're in now,
does it have a name?

585
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,510
Billongamick.

586
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:49,848
Billongamick.
Does that mean something?

587
01:02:51,350 --> 01:02:52,726
Mick's Place.

588
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,938
Okay, why does it mean that?

589
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:01,693
- 'Cause I own it, I guess.
- You own it?

590
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:05,238
Yeah, an uncle of mine
left it to me years ago.

591
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,325
How big is Mick's Place?

592
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:13,121
It's not very big. You could walk
across it in three or four days.

593
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:19,711
Three or four days! You can walk
across New York State in two!

594
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,507
Yeah, but this is the Territory.

595
01:03:23,591 --> 01:03:26,510
I mean, anything under 1,000
square miles up here is a hobby farm.

596
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:31,014
And Mick's Place,
it's all swamps and rocky mountains.

597
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:34,684
The only thing you can
raise around here are mosquitoes.

598
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:39,105
Well, I don't care if it is worthless.
I'm glad it's yours, I love it.

599
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:46,238
I wouldn't say it's worthless.
It does have some redeeming features.

600
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,247
Is this what I think it is?

601
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:58,166
Tomorrow, when we go up
to my weekender,

602
01:03:58,251 --> 01:04:00,168
I'll show you the Reserve Bank.

603
01:04:00,253 --> 01:04:03,964
That's what I call my mine.
It's like my retirement fund.

604
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,301
Hey, Miguel!

605
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:55,974
It's been a long time, amigo.

606
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,358
You look good, Frank.

607
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,986
This is Mr. Rico. He pays the bills.

608
01:05:08,821 --> 01:05:10,363
How're you doin'?

609
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:14,784
That's Denning.
And Erskine in the truck.

610
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:19,372
They're good men.

611
01:05:22,251 --> 01:05:24,711
You didn't have to
bring in extra help, Mr. Rico.

612
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,963
Me and my guys
can take care of Dundee.

613
01:05:28,007 --> 01:05:30,592
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

614
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:36,681
That's Teddy. He's a tracker.

615
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:39,726
Dundee went bush about a week ago

616
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:42,395
and Teddy's the fella
that's gonna help us find him.

617
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,649
The fella you're looking for,
would that be Mick Dundee?

618
01:05:45,733 --> 01:05:47,442
Yeah, so what?

619
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:54,866
For you.

620
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:05,043
Where's he going?

621
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:07,963
I don't know.

622
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:10,048
Denning, bring him back!

623
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,594
Come back!

624
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,487
He's gone!

625
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,157
Shit!

626
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,202
This holds us up, no?

627
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:41,371
Nah. No worries, Mr. Rico.

628
01:06:41,455 --> 01:06:44,374
Maybe just a day or two
till we pick us up another tracker.

629
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,376
What?

630
01:06:52,174 --> 01:06:53,466
There's a quicker way.

631
01:07:32,965 --> 01:07:35,383
This is the luxury holiday house?

632
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:37,594
Yeah.

633
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,979
- View's pretty good.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

634
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,066
Probably double the value of this place.

635
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:53,485
That'd be $200,

636
01:07:54,945 --> 01:07:57,363
$300, minimum.

637
01:07:58,532 --> 01:08:01,659
Well, you're the only one
I've ever brought here.

638
01:08:18,969 --> 01:08:21,763
I'm so lucky to have a rich man like you.

639
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,531
What is it?

640
01:08:46,372 --> 01:08:48,790
I think you'd better come with me.

641
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,569
Don't...

642
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:21,781
Dundee!

643
01:09:24,201 --> 01:09:27,078
I know you're up there. Come down,

644
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:29,581
or I shoot your friend.

645
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:52,437
Shoot the dopey bastard!

646
01:10:12,583 --> 01:10:14,083
You shot Walter!

647
01:10:14,251 --> 01:10:17,670
Yeah. It was all I could think of
to save his life.

648
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:20,590
- By shooting him?
- I only nicked him.

649
01:10:57,002 --> 01:11:00,088
Now we're all on foot.
That makes us even.

650
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,006
Seven to two is even?

651
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:30,493
I thought you two were mates.

652
01:11:32,413 --> 01:11:33,746
So did I.

653
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:39,752
Garcia, kill him.

654
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:03,651
Wait.

655
01:12:07,114 --> 01:12:09,282
Why would Dundee want you dead?

656
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,706
You know this country?

657
01:12:20,085 --> 01:12:23,921
Well, of course, you see...

658
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:28,760
That's his backyard, up there.

659
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:33,848
And no man alive
knows this place better.

660
01:12:35,100 --> 01:12:37,935
Except perhaps me. I'm sorry.

661
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,523
So he shot his best mate?

662
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,611
What a bastard.

663
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:52,075
This man thinks like me.

664
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,329
Garcia, let him go.

665
01:13:08,258 --> 01:13:09,634
You stay up front.

666
01:13:11,053 --> 01:13:12,345
Let's go.

667
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,085
Yeah, that's what I'm looking for.

668
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:50,758
Looks like they've found the shack.

669
01:13:50,843 --> 01:13:53,302
- You think they'll find us?
- Should do.

670
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,806
I left a trail even Wally could follow.

671
01:14:05,065 --> 01:14:08,693
- Take your bra off.
- This is hardly the time!

672
01:15:09,254 --> 01:15:12,048
Hey! Look at this!

673
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:08,563
You've lost 'em.

674
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,858
- You still know how to shoot.
- Yeah, that was great.

675
01:16:22,869 --> 01:16:25,288
If he moves, kill him.

676
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:47,852
Mick, the gun's empty.
There's no more bullets.

677
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:52,565
But he doesn't know that.
Not much you can do about it anyway.

678
01:16:53,483 --> 01:16:55,610
Be back soon. I'll check on Wally.

679
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,320
Do you know where they are?

680
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,156
Yeah.

681
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:03,534
About 500 yards that way,
behind that ridge.

682
01:17:05,912 --> 01:17:07,163
How do you know that?

683
01:17:09,207 --> 01:17:10,916
Can't you smell it?

684
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:14,211
Their sweat?

685
01:17:15,172 --> 01:17:16,964
Wally's aftershave.

686
01:17:32,439 --> 01:17:34,231
Where are you going?

687
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:38,361
We're camping.
Do you want coffee or not?

688
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,851
- Come on!
- I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming!

689
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,775
Garcia!

690
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:21,278
- What's happened?
- Crocodile.

691
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:24,490
You're joking.

692
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:26,617
Yeah.

693
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:30,121
Yeah, it's a croc. Big one.

694
01:18:31,998 --> 01:18:33,624
16 feet.

695
01:18:34,626 --> 01:18:37,753
See where he knelt to fill his canteen.

696
01:18:38,463 --> 01:18:41,132
You think he was taken by un cocodrilo?

697
01:18:42,968 --> 01:18:47,138
Well, you could put it like that, yes.

698
01:18:57,983 --> 01:18:59,150
Look!

699
01:19:14,624 --> 01:19:16,917
There's nothing we can do here.

700
01:19:21,381 --> 01:19:23,340
You, get some water.

701
01:19:24,176 --> 01:19:25,509
Jose.

702
01:19:26,511 --> 01:19:28,095
Stay with him.

703
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,304
What's that?

704
01:20:10,388 --> 01:20:13,432
I'm gonna make a telephone call.
See who's about.

705
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:17,019
I think we're gonna need some help.

706
01:20:17,562 --> 01:20:21,232
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Would Bonnie say no to Clyde?

707
01:20:22,400 --> 01:20:23,567
Who?

708
01:20:38,416 --> 01:20:40,209
That's the tree.

709
01:20:50,345 --> 01:20:51,512
There's the bats.

710
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:02,273
Fill this up with those berries.
I'll be up on top of the ridge.

711
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,163
What the hell is that?

712
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:46,418
That is the mating call
of the jarra jarra bird.

713
01:22:46,586 --> 01:22:50,547
It's a very large native bird, it's very rare.

714
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:53,092
Meat eater.

715
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:56,387
Has been known
to take small children away.

716
01:22:57,222 --> 01:23:00,307
But don't worry,
it won't come near the fire.

717
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:13,070
Mick.

718
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:16,949
Thank God you're back.
Did you hear that noise?

719
01:23:17,117 --> 01:23:18,492
What noise?

720
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:21,578
I don't know.
I never heard anything like it.

721
01:23:22,914 --> 01:23:24,331
Wind, maybe.

722
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:27,751
What's in the bag?

723
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:30,879
A little present.

724
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:56,113
Smell.

725
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,118
It stinks! Is it gonna work?

726
01:24:01,870 --> 01:24:05,664
Oh, yeah.
To a bat, this is like that Channel No. 5.

727
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:11,962
I'll be back for dinner.

728
01:24:13,506 --> 01:24:15,591
Keep an eye on the kids.

729
01:24:25,143 --> 01:24:28,145
Listen, boys,
you should be nice for the lady.

730
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:32,357
She's not here to guard you,
she's here to protect you.

731
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:35,402
You see, you two aren't the only

732
01:24:36,821 --> 01:24:39,323
crawler nasties in this place.

733
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:46,849
Dundee.

734
01:25:48,893 --> 01:25:50,727
Tell me about him.

735
01:25:54,566 --> 01:25:59,903
Well, there are bushmen
and there's Mick Dundee.

736
01:26:02,365 --> 01:26:08,287
See, he's more like an Aborigine
than a white man.

737
01:26:09,289 --> 01:26:12,082
He was adopted by Aborigines,

738
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,752
and he had to go through that initiation.

739
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:19,923
He knows about their magic.

740
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:26,054
Their black magic.

741
01:26:29,934 --> 01:26:33,353
You know, some people say

742
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:37,441
that he talks to the animals.

743
01:26:40,987 --> 01:26:43,238
The Aborigines call him

744
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:47,618
Jabajada Arderdah, which means,

745
01:26:48,745 --> 01:26:53,165
"The crocodile who walks like a man. "

746
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:03,800
If what you say is true,
it's lucky we brought the Kryptonite.

747
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,370
Look at that!

748
01:28:25,675 --> 01:28:27,217
Get some sleep.

749
01:28:29,429 --> 01:28:32,806
- Gonna be a long day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

750
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,727
Gonna be a long night, too.

751
01:29:00,585 --> 01:29:02,210
Quick hands.

752
01:29:04,714 --> 01:29:06,423
Shit!

753
01:29:09,969 --> 01:29:13,096
- What is it?
- A snake. A bloody big snake.

754
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:15,307
It's just a python, you big girl.

755
01:29:15,475 --> 01:29:18,185
Yeah, well, see how you like it if
someone comes running out of the dark

756
01:29:18,269 --> 01:29:19,811
and throws one at you.

757
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:25,108
- Dundee was here, in the camp?
- Yeah. He ran straight through.

758
01:29:25,443 --> 01:29:27,944
And you didn't even get a shot off?

759
01:29:29,530 --> 01:29:31,740
Well, he came out of nowhere.

760
01:29:34,952 --> 01:29:37,454
And he moved like lightning, and...

761
01:29:39,624 --> 01:29:41,583
And there was no sound.

762
01:29:42,627 --> 01:29:44,461
No sound at all.

763
01:29:48,257 --> 01:29:51,134
Dundee's some sort of a ghost
or something.

764
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:54,930
This Dundee
likes to play games, Miguel.

765
01:29:57,183 --> 01:30:00,769
Maybe we teach him
some good games when it gets light.

766
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,662
Come on, Jose, get up.

767
01:30:26,671 --> 01:30:30,590
I told you. Black magic.

768
01:30:33,678 --> 01:30:35,137
Crap magic.

769
01:30:36,013 --> 01:30:38,140
Sweep the area, and stick together.

770
01:30:45,815 --> 01:30:47,190
You!

771
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,112
He didn't fly in here and take Jose.

772
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:56,366
There must be tracks. Find them.

773
01:31:08,379 --> 01:31:09,379
Hey.

774
01:31:10,381 --> 01:31:12,549
You thinking what I'm thinking?

775
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:15,177
We're headed
in the right direction, mate.

776
01:31:15,553 --> 01:31:17,971
- Let's get the hell out of this.
- You got it.

777
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:48,084
Jaba Point?

778
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:53,423
You want me to lead them
to Jaba Point?

779
01:31:55,092 --> 01:31:56,301
Got it.

780
01:32:06,771 --> 01:32:08,230
I got it.

781
01:32:11,108 --> 01:32:12,317
Okay.

782
01:32:14,445 --> 01:32:19,449
Well, I think we'd better get the others,
now I know where he's headed.

783
01:32:20,201 --> 01:32:23,745
Jaba Point, because there's
fresh water there and caves.

784
01:32:26,832 --> 01:32:28,291
What makes you so sure?

785
01:32:29,293 --> 01:32:33,046
Because I understand how
the bastard thinks.

786
01:32:34,131 --> 01:32:35,590
I taught him.

787
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:42,472
And now I owe him one.

788
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,477
We'll see.

789
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:50,480
You stay in front of me,

790
01:32:51,649 --> 01:32:53,608
- bushman.
- Okay.

791
01:33:22,972 --> 01:33:27,100
- How are you holding up, soldier?
- Tired. A little scared.

792
01:33:27,643 --> 01:33:29,728
But I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

793
01:33:29,812 --> 01:33:31,187
Fun, isn't it?

794
01:33:31,272 --> 01:33:33,023
- Fun?
- Yeah.

795
01:33:39,530 --> 01:33:43,033
Now you can get some sleep.
Relief watch has arrived.

796
01:33:47,622 --> 01:33:49,873
- Charlie, thanks for coming, mate.
- Hello, Mick.

797
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:51,791
Telephone call.

798
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,753
Sue, this is Charlie.

799
01:33:55,755 --> 01:33:57,172
And Diamond.

800
01:33:58,215 --> 01:34:00,467
Crikey, Diamond,
you must have a tapeworm!

801
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:03,386
Every time I see you,
you've got food in your hand.

802
01:34:06,724 --> 01:34:09,225
We've been here since first light.

803
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,438
The two brothers are over there,
looking out for them other fellas.

804
01:34:13,606 --> 01:34:16,775
You keep an eye on this lot.
I'm gonna go after Wally.

805
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:18,443
Okay, mate.

806
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,200
Can I help?

807
01:34:25,951 --> 01:34:28,328
Well, I really wanted to
get ahead of Wally.

808
01:34:28,412 --> 01:34:31,456
I know, a sheila would
only slow you down.

809
01:34:32,333 --> 01:34:33,333
Mick.

810
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,127
Be careful. This isn't a game.

811
01:34:37,963 --> 01:34:39,214
It is to me.

812
01:35:02,279 --> 01:35:04,906
No, mate. We just hold them.

813
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:08,785
What did he say?

814
01:35:10,663 --> 01:35:13,123
He wants to know
if we're allowed to eat these men.

815
01:35:34,895 --> 01:35:38,606
We made the right decision, mate.
Stuff the money.

816
01:35:39,817 --> 01:35:42,318
Yeah, I've had a bad feeling about this

817
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:45,155
ever since
that old black tracker walked off.

818
01:35:46,031 --> 01:35:49,909
You know, I thought that greaser
really did turn into a goanna.

819
01:35:53,956 --> 01:35:54,956
Erskine?

820
01:35:58,461 --> 01:35:59,878
Erskine?

821
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:05,425
Don't fool around.

822
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,010
Erskine!

823
01:36:28,616 --> 01:36:31,826
He's headed for Jaba Point,
that's for sure.

824
01:36:32,244 --> 01:36:35,413
We cross here. You lead the way,
amigo, we'll cover you.

825
01:36:36,707 --> 01:36:37,916
Yeah.

826
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:22,043
We don't need him now, anyway.

827
01:37:22,837 --> 01:37:24,796
He's already shown us
the way to Jaba Point.

828
01:37:28,717 --> 01:37:30,593
We'll cross over here.

829
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,778
I knew it was you all the time.

830
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:52,699
First you shoot my head,
now you try to drown me.

831
01:37:52,783 --> 01:37:55,952
- You've been hit.
- It's only a scratch, mate.

832
01:37:57,496 --> 01:37:58,872
Listen, don't put that in the water,

833
01:37:58,956 --> 01:38:00,623
'cause there might be
real crocs down there.

834
01:38:00,708 --> 01:38:02,667
Where do you think I got this fella?

835
01:38:03,836 --> 01:38:05,253
In here.

836
01:38:08,966 --> 01:38:12,176
- Should have seen your face, Wal.
- What was the matter with it?

837
01:38:12,344 --> 01:38:13,803
- You shit yourself.
- I did not!

838
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,221
- Yes, you did.
- No, I did not.

839
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:17,724
- You didn't know it was me.
- Yeah, I did!

840
01:38:34,658 --> 01:38:36,367
G'day. Want a cold one?

841
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:39,871
- Who the hell are you?
- Call me Nugget.

842
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:41,748
I've been looking for Walter Reilly.

843
01:38:44,418 --> 01:38:46,002
Haven't seen him around, have you?

844
01:38:47,671 --> 01:38:49,672
You should have brought a gun
instead of beer, mate.

845
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:54,385
Nah, I don't need a gun. I've got a Donk.

846
01:38:59,058 --> 01:39:00,767
You've got a what?

847
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:04,520
Donk.

848
01:39:25,209 --> 01:39:27,710
Walter! Over here!

849
01:39:28,379 --> 01:39:33,591
There you are! I was just
making sure that nobody followed me.

850
01:39:33,759 --> 01:39:37,220
- How'd you get away?
- Well, it was a piece of cake really.

851
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:42,058
It was just a question of timing,
'cause Mick and I had this plan.

852
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,602
- You've been shot again.
- No, that's Mick's.

853
01:39:44,770 --> 01:39:46,396
- What?
- No...

854
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:48,523
He's all right. It's just a scratch.

855
01:39:48,607 --> 01:39:49,649
Where is he?

856
01:39:49,733 --> 01:39:53,444
He's leading those other
two mongrels up to Jaba Point.

857
01:39:53,779 --> 01:39:55,530
That's mountain goat country,

858
01:39:55,614 --> 01:40:00,410
so he's gonna have a picnic
with those two!

859
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:05,957
Sue, what are you doing?
Mick told us to wait here.

860
01:40:06,041 --> 01:40:09,502
Mick thinks this is some big game.
Rico didn't come here for a picnic.

861
01:40:09,586 --> 01:40:10,670
Which way is it?

862
01:40:14,591 --> 01:40:17,093
Well, I'll have to go with you.

863
01:40:28,939 --> 01:40:31,941
Are you really enjoying that?

864
01:40:34,611 --> 01:40:36,571
Nah. Needs garlic.

865
01:41:16,361 --> 01:41:19,530
It's time we stopped playing
this bushman's game his way.

866
01:41:20,824 --> 01:41:22,492
What do you mean?

867
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:28,831
This man can take us
anytime he wants to.

868
01:41:30,918 --> 01:41:32,043
No.

869
01:41:33,170 --> 01:41:34,504
Now we finish it.

870
01:41:35,506 --> 01:41:38,508
Think! When we were children,

871
01:41:39,468 --> 01:41:42,053
did you chase a snake into
the cane fields?

872
01:41:46,850 --> 01:41:49,018
Move to those rocks and wait.

873
01:43:52,643 --> 01:43:54,143
G'day, amigo.

874
01:44:04,529 --> 01:44:06,322
Take your pants off.

875
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,285
He's got Mick!

876
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:16,726
Mick.

877
01:45:56,350 --> 01:45:57,683
If Mick want his clothes back,

878
01:45:57,768 --> 01:46:00,394
he can climb down there
and get it his bloody self.

879
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:04,065
What?

880
01:46:08,612 --> 01:46:10,154
Mick's clothes.

881
01:46:11,406 --> 01:46:15,284
We swapped it with that bastard,
so we can flush the other fella out.

882
01:46:15,452 --> 01:46:17,953
Plan was working
till you turned up and shot Mick.

883
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,922
That's not Mick?

884
01:46:31,134 --> 01:46:34,595
'Course not. There's Mick over there.

885
01:47:04,167 --> 01:47:06,794
Mick's bloody lucky
you can't shoot straight, Wal.

886
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:17,763
You ready to go home now?

887
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:19,265
I am home.

888
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,844
You ready to go home now?
