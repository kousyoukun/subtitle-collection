1
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:07,694
Hey, Miguel!

2
00:00:09,904 --> 00:00:13,613
It's been a long time, amigo.

3
00:00:20,264 --> 00:00:25,213
You look good, Frank.
This is Mr Rico. He pays the bills.

4
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:28,018
How're you doin'?

5
00:00:28,224 --> 00:00:32,502
That's Denning. And Erskine in the truck.

6
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,550
They're good men.

7
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:42,790
You didn't have to bring extra help.
We can take care of Dundee.

8
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:47,670
- You know him?
- I heard of him.

9
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:52,630
That's Teddy. He's a tracker.

10
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:57,430
Dundee went bush about a week ago
and Teddy'll help us find him.

11
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,750
The fella you're looking for,
is it Mick Dundee?

12
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:02,910
Yeah, so what?

13
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:10,430
For you.

14
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,790
Where's he going?

15
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,030
I don't know.

16
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:24,990
Denning, bring him back!

17
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:28,590
Come back!

18
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,270
He's gone!

19
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:49,950
Shit!

20
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,190
- This holds us up?
- No worries.

21
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:57,550
Maybe a day or two
to get another tracker.

22
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,030
What?

23
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,950
There's a quicker way.

24
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,870
This is the luxury holiday house?

25
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:48,630
Yeah.

26
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,110
- View's pretty good.
- Yeah, it's not bad.

27
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,110
Probably double the value of this place.

28
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,390
That'd be... two...

29
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,430
...three hundred dollars, minimum.

30
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:12,390
Well... you're the only one
I've ever brought here.

31
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,830
I'm so lucky to have a rich man like you.

32
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:48,030
What is it?

33
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,070
I think you'd better come with me.

34
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,470
Don't...!

35
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,710
Dundee!

36
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:35,710
I know you're up there.
Come down, or I shoot your friend.

37
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:59,470
Shoot the dopey bastard!

38
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,230
You shot Walter!

39
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:21,710
Yeah. It was all I could think of
to save his life.

40
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,350
- By shooting him?
- I only nicked him.

41
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:05,030
- Now we're all on foot. That's even.
- Seven to two is even?

42
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:33,230
I thought you two were mates.

43
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,990
So did I.

44
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,430
Garcia, kill him.

45
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:03,990
Wait.

46
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:09,710
Why would Dundee want you dead?

47
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,510
You know this country?

48
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:22,750
Well, of course, you see...

49
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:27,430
That's his backyard, up there.

50
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:33,310
And no man alive
knows this place better.

51
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:36,230
Except perhaps me. And so...

52
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,870
So he shot his best mate.

53
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,830
What a bastard.

54
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:50,430
This man thinks like me.

55
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,790
Garcia, let him go.

56
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,830
You stay up front.

57
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,910
Let's go.

58
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:40,670
There, that's what I'm looking for.

59
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,990
They've found the shack.

60
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,110
- Think they'll find us?
- Should do.

61
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,670
I left a trail even Wally could follow.

62
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,190
- Take your bra off.
- This is hardly the time!

63
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,270
Hey! Look at this!

64
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,390
You've lost 'em.

65
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:03,430
- You still know how to shoot.
- Yeah, feels great.

66
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,790
If he moves, kill him.

67
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:36,630
Mick, the gun's empty.
There's no more bullets.

68
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:41,070
But he doesn't know that.
Not much he can do about it anyway.

69
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:46,310
- Back soon. I'll check on Wally.
- Do you know where they are?

70
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,830
Yeah.

71
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:52,150
About 500 yards that way,
behind that ridge.

72
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,190
How do you know that?

73
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:59,870
Can't you smell it?

74
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:04,230
- Their sweat?
- Wally's aftershave.

75
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,510
Where are you going?

76
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:25,550
We're camping.
Do you want coffee or not?

77
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:56,070
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

78
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,950
- What's happened?
- Crocodile.

79
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,590
You're joking.

80
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:14,070
Yeah, it's a croc. Big one.

81
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,630
Sixteen feet.

82
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,830
See where he knelt
to fill his canteen.

83
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,950
You think he was taken by un cocodrilo?

84
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:30,310
Well, you could put it like that, yes.

85
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,550
Look!

86
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,590
There's nothing we can do here.

87
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,670
You, get some water.

88
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:07,870
Jose.

89
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:10,630
Stay with him.

90
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,830
- What's that?
- I'm gonna make a telephone call.

91
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:56,870
See who's about.
I think we're gonna need some help.

92
00:14:57,070 --> 00:15:01,470
- Wanna give me a hand?
- Would Bonnie say no to Clyde?

93
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:03,430
Who?

94
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,590
That's the tree.

95
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,070
There's the bats.

96
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,070
Fill this up with those berries.
I'll be up on top of the ridge.

97
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,790
What the hell is that?

98
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:19,790
That is the mating call
of the jarra jarra bird.

99
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,310
It's a very large native bird, it's very rare.

100
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,990
Meat-eater. Has been known
to take small children away.

101
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:34,350
But don't worry,
it won't come near the fire.

102
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,070
Thank God you're back.
Did you hear that noise?

103
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:53,830
- What noise?
- I never heard anything like it.

104
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,070
Wind, maybe.

105
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,670
What's in the bag?

106
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,510
A little present.

107
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:27,270
Smell.

108
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:31,990
It stinks! Is it gonna work?

109
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,870
Oh, yeah. To a bat,
this is like that Channel No 5.

110
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,310
I'll be back for dinner.

111
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:46,710
Keep an eye on the kids.

112
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,910
Listen, boys,
you should be nice for the lady.

113
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:02,830
She's not here to guard you,
she's here to protect you.

114
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,510
You two aren't the only...

115
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:08,390
...crawling nasties in this place.

116
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,350
Dundee.

117
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,190
Tell me about him.

118
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:26,030
Well, there are bushmen
and there's Mick Dundee.

119
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:33,630
See, he's more like an Aborigine
than a white man.

120
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,590
He was adopted by Aborigines,

121
00:20:37,790 --> 00:20:41,270
and he had to go through that initiation.

122
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:44,790
He knows about their magic.

123
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:47,830
Their...

124
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,590
...black magic.

125
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:58,870
You know, some people say

126
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:01,750
that he talks to the animals.

127
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:07,470
The Aborigines call him...

128
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,950
...Jabajada Arderdah, which means,

129
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,910
The crocodile who walks like a man.

130
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,870
If what you say is true,
it's lucky we brought the Kryptonite.

126
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,510
Look at that!

127
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:47,350
Get some sleep.

128
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:53,390
- Gonna be a long day tomorrow.
- Yeah.

129
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:56,270
Gonna be a long night, too.

130
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,030
Quick hands.

131
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,230
Shit!

132
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,550
- What is it?
- A bloody big snake.

133
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,750
It's a python, you big girl.

134
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:37,750
See how you like it if someone runs
out of the dark and throws one at you.

135
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:42,270
- Dundee was here, in the camp?
- He ran straight through.

136
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,310
You didn't even get a shot off?

137
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,070
Well, he came out of nowhere.

138
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,710
And he moved like lightning, and...

139
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:58,750
...and there was no sound.

140
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,830
No sound at all.

141
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:07,110
Dundee's some sort of a ghost
or something.

142
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:10,990
This Dundee likes to play games, Miguel.

143
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:16,990
Maybe we'll teach him
some good games when it gets light.

144
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,070
Come on, Jose, get up.

145
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:44,870
I told you. Black magic.

146
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,950
Crap magic.

147
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:53,310
Sweep the area, and stick together.

148
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,910
You!

149
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:06,430
He didn't fly in here and take Jose.

150
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,750
There must be tracks. Find them.

151
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:27,870
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- We're headed in the right direction.

152
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,710
- Let's get out.
- You got it.

153
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,430
Jaba Point?

154
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:04,590
You want me to lead them
to Jaba Point?

155
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,390
Got it.

156
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:19,710
I got it.

157
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,870
OK.

158
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:29,910
Well, I think we'd better get the others,
now I know where he's headed.

159
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:34,630
Jaba Point, because there's
fresh water there and caves.

160
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,630
What makes you so sure?

161
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,270
Because I understand
how the bastard thinks.

162
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:46,230
I taught him.

163
00:26:49,430 --> 00:26:51,790
And now I owe him one.

164
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,990
We'll see.

165
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:59,950
You stay in front of me...

166
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,110
...bushman.
- OK.

167
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:34,550
- How are you holding up, soldier?
- Tired. A little scared.

168
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,070
- But I wouldn't have missed it.
- Fun, isn't it?

169
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:40,230
- Fun?
- Yeah.

170
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:50,790
Now you can get some sleep.
Relief watch has arrived.

171
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,550
- Charlie, thanks for coming.
- Mick.

172
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,030
- Telephone call.
- Sue, this is Charlie.

173
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,910
And Diamond.

174
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:10,070
Crikey, you must have a tapeworm!
You've always got food in your hand.

175
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:14,550
We've been here since first light.

176
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:18,670
The two brothers are over there,
looking out for the others.

177
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:21,870
Watch this lot. I'll go after Wally.

178
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:24,190
OK, mate.

179
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,630
- Can I help?
- I really wanted to get ahead of Wally.

180
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,590
I know, a sheila would
only slow you down.

181
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,030
Be careful. This isn't a game.

182
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:44,910
It is to me.

183
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,990
No, mate. We just hold them.

184
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,390
What did he say?

185
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,950
He wants to know
if we're allowed to eat these men.

186
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:41,350
We made the right decision, mate.
Stuff the money.

187
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:47,310
Yeah, I've had a bad feeling about this
since that old black tracker walked off.

188
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:52,070
You know, I thought that greaser
really did turn into a goanna.

189
00:29:55,230 --> 00:29:56,990
Erskine?

190
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,590
Don't fool around. Erskine!

191
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:31,270
He's headed for Jaba Point,
that's for sure.

192
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:35,870
We cross here.
You lead the way, we'll cover you.

193
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,630
Yeah.

194
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:20,150
We don't need him now, anyway.

195
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:23,710
He's already shown us
the way to Jaba Point.

196
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:28,470
We'll cross over here.

197
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,670
I knew it was you all the time.

198
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,950
First you shoot me,
now you try to drown me.

199
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:53,390
- You've been hit.
- It's only a scratch, mate.

200
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:56,510
Careful, there might be
real crocs down there.

201
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:59,470
Where do you think I got this fellow?

202
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,670
In here.

203
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,630
- Should have seen your face.
- What about it?

204
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:10,390
- You shit yourself.
- I did not!

205
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:12,750
- You didn't know it was me.
- I did!

206
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,270
G'day. Want a cold one?

207
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:34,550
- Who the hell are you?
- Nugget.

208
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,270
I've been looking for Walter Reilly.

209
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,510
Haven't seen him around, have you?

210
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:44,550
You should have brought a gun
instead of beer.

211
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:48,590
No, I don't need a gun. I've got a Donk.

212
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:55,150
You've got a what?

213
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,470
Donk.

214
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:20,550
Walter! Over here!

215
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:25,710
There you are! I was just
making sure nobody followed me.

216
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:29,190
- How d'you get away?
- It was a piece of cake.

217
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:34,390
It was just a question of timing,
'cause Mick and I had this plan.

218
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,270
- You were shot.
- No, Mick.

219
00:33:36,470 --> 00:33:40,110
- What!
- He's all right. It's just a scratch.

220
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:44,910
- Where is he?
- He's leading those two to Jaba Point.

221
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:48,230
That's mountain goat country, so...

222
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:52,390
...he's gonna have a picnic
with those two!

223
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,590
What are you doing? Mick said wait.

224
00:33:56,790 --> 00:34:00,070
Mick thinks it's a game.
Rico's no picnic.

225
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:02,590
Which way is it?

226
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,030
Well, I'll have to go with you.

227
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:21,630
Are you really enjoying that?

228
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,190
Nah. Needs garlic.

229
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,310
It's time we stopped playing
this bushman's game his way.

230
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,870
What do you mean?

231
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:18,030
This man can take us
any time he wants to.

232
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:20,230
No.

233
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:23,510
Now we finish it. Think!

234
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:26,270
When we were children,

235
00:35:26,470 --> 00:35:30,430
did you chase a snake
into the cane fields?

236
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,870
Move to those rocks and wait.

237
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:36,110
G'day, amigo.

238
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:48,230
Take your pants off.

239
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:32,390
He's got Mick!

240
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:37,790
If Mick wants his clothes back,
he can climb down himself.

241
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,670
What?

242
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:47,030
Mick's clothes.

243
00:39:47,230 --> 00:39:50,910
We swapped with that bastard,
to flush the other one out.

244
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,910
Plan was working
till you turned up and shot Mick.

245
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,790
That's... not Mick?

246
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:09,550
Course not. There's Mick over there.

247
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:41,430
Mick's bloody lucky
you can't shoot straight.

248
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:53,190
- You ready to go home now?
- I am home.
