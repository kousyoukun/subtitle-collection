6
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:27,915
I owe everything to George Bailey.

7
00:01:28,354 --> 00:01:30,185
Help him, dear Father.

8
00:01:30,623 --> 00:01:33,615
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

9
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:36,320
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

10
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,390
Help my son George tonight.

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,200
He never thinks about himself, God.

12
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:43,963
That's why he's in trouble.

13
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,196
George is a good guy.

14
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:47,634
Give him a break, God.

15
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,833
I love him, dear Lord.

16
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,808
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,609
Please, God.

18
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,977
Something's the matter with Daddy.

19
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,346
Please bring Daddy back.

20
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,476
Please bring Daddy home.

21
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:02,782
Watch over him tonight.

22
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:05,453
Please bring Daddy back.

23
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:11,386
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

24
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:14,092
Looks like we'll have to send someone down.

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,260
A lot of people asking for help for a man named George Bailey.

26
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,860
George Bailey?

27
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,440
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night. You're right.

28
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,374
We'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?

29
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,775
That's why I came to see you, sir.

30
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:29,480
It's that clockmaker's turn again.

31
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:32,813
Oh, Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

32
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,784
We've passed him up right along.

33
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:38,324
Because, you know, sir, he's got the IQ of a rabbit.

34
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:41,860
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child. Simple.

35
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:43,952
Joseph, send for Clarence.

36
00:02:47,433 --> 00:02:48,991
You sent for me, sir?

37
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:52,037
Yes, Clarence. A man down on Earth needs our help.

38
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:53,571
Splendid. Is he sick?

39
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,732
No, worse. He's discouraged.

40
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,402
At exactly 10:45 p.m. Earth time,

41
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,536
that man will be thinking seriously

42
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,581
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

43
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,277
Oh, dear, dear, his life? Then I've only an hour to dress.

44
00:03:06,386 --> 00:03:07,648
What are they wearing now?

45
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:09,085
You will spend that hour

46
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:10,816
getting acquainted with George Bailey.

47
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:13,893
Sir, if I should accomplish this mission,

48
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:17,429
I mean, might I perhaps win my wings?

49
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,964
I've been waiting for over 200 years now, sir,

50
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,590
and people are beginning to talk.

51
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,168
What's that book you've got there?

52
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,396
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

53
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,871
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey

54
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,271
and you'll get your wings.

55
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,104
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

56
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,941
Poor George. Sit down.

57
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,173
Sit down? What are we...

58
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,942
If you're going to help a man,

59
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,382
you want to know something about him, don't you?

60
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:40,952
Well, naturally, of course. I...

61
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,316
Now, keep your eyes open.

62
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,315
See the town?

63
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:47,086
Where? I don't see a thing.

64
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:50,026
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet.

65
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:53,030
Now, look, I'll help you out. Concentrate.

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,529
Begin to see something?

67
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:58,297
Why, yes. This is amazing.

68
00:03:58,438 --> 00:04:00,963
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.

69
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,803
Oh, wonderful.

70
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,605
Yay! Yippee!

71
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,680
Okay, boys, let's go.

72
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,441
Hey, who's that?

73
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:11,380
That's your problem. George Bailey.

74
00:04:11,484 --> 00:04:12,508
A boy?

75
00:04:12,619 --> 00:04:15,645
That's him when he was 12 back in 1919.

76
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,088
Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.

77
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:21,521
Come on, Marty.

78
00:04:21,628 --> 00:04:23,459
Let's go, Marty!

79
00:04:24,297 --> 00:04:25,764
Attaboy, Marty.

80
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:28,291
Hee-haw!

81
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,335
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

82
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:35,541
Here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother Harry Bailey.

83
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:37,337
I'm not scared.

84
00:04:38,478 --> 00:04:39,843
Come on, Harry.

85
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,907
Let's go, Harry!

86
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,312
Come on, Harry!

87
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,542
Come on, Harry!

88
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,642
- Come on, Harry! - Come on, Harry!

89
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:48,752
Help, George, help!

90
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:49,913
Help!

91
00:04:51,057 --> 00:04:53,525
Don't worry, Harry. I'm coming!

92
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,888
- Help! - Hang on, Harry!

93
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:58,461
- Help. - Make a chain, gang.

94
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:01,032
George saved his brother's life that day,

95
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,800
but he caught a bad cold which infected his left ear.

96
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,466
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

97
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:09,837
It was weeks before he was able to go back

98
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:13,275
to his after-school job at old man Gower's drugstore.

99
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,172
Mr. Potter.

100
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,545
Who's that, a king?

101
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,550
That's Henry F. Potter,

102
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,985
the richest and meanest man in the county.

103
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,490
- Hee-haw! Hee-haw! - Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

104
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,924
Go to work, slave.

105
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,126
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

106
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,570
Wish I had a million dollars.

107
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:40,432
Hot dog!

108
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,244
It's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

109
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,313
You're late.

110
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:48,675
Yes, sir.

111
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,321
Hello, George.

112
00:05:58,691 --> 00:05:59,953
Hello, Mary.

113
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:01,618
Hello, Violet.

114
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:03,286
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

115
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:04,727
She was here first.

116
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:06,662
I'm still thinking.

117
00:06:06,766 --> 00:06:07,790
Shoelaces?

118
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,458
Please, Georgie.

119
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:11,128
I like him.

120
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,966
You like every boy.

121
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,699
What's wrong with that?

122
00:06:14,807 --> 00:06:16,274
Here you are.

123
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:18,300
Help me down?

124
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,276
Help you down?

125
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,816
Made up your mind yet?

126
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,650
I'll take chocolate.

127
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:33,451
- With coconuts? - I don't like coconuts.

128
00:06:33,826 --> 00:06:35,487
You don't like coconuts?

129
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:38,991
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?

130
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:41,030
Lookit here.

131
00:06:41,134 --> 00:06:44,297
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea.

132
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:47,868
A new magazine. I never saw it before.

133
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,909
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it.

134
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,946
I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.

135
00:06:56,482 --> 00:06:58,416
Is this the ear you can't hear on?

136
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,215
George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die.

137
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,256
I'm going out exploring someday. You watch.

138
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:08,589
And I'm gonna have a couple of harems and maybe three or four wives.

139
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:09,888
Wait and see.

140
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:16,301
- George. George! - Yes, sir?

141
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:18,836
You're not paid to be a canary.

142
00:07:19,172 --> 00:07:20,434
No, sir.

143
00:07:47,834 --> 00:07:50,735
Mr. Gower, do you want something? Anything?

144
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:52,027
No.

145
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,366
- Anything I can do back here? - No.

146
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,308
I'll get them, sir.

147
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,140
Quick, take those capsules over to Mrs. Blaine.

148
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,576
She's waiting for them.

149
00:08:02,682 --> 00:08:03,979
Yes, sir.

150
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,698
They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?

151
00:08:28,808 --> 00:08:29,832
Yeah.

152
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,710
Is it a charge, sir?

153
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,376
Yes, George.

154
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,072
Mr. Gower, I...

155
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,581
- Oh, get going. - Yes, sir.

156
00:09:04,076 --> 00:09:06,271
Avast there, Captain Cook. Where you heading?

157
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,813
- I've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy. - Some other time, George.

158
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,678
- It's important. - There's a squall in there.

159
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,273
It's shaping up into a storm.

160
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,478
- Uncle Billy, telephone. - Who is it?

161
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,817
- Bank examiner. - Bank examiner?

162
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:19,117
I should have called him yesterday.

163
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:20,817
Switch it inside.

164
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,528
I'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

165
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,461
Well, you're begging. That's a whole lot worse.

166
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,329
All I'm asking for is 30 days more.

167
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,833
- Pop. - Just a minute, Son.

168
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,598
Just 30 short days. I'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

169
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,967
- Shove me up, shove me up. - Pop.

170
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,870
- Just a minute. - Have you put any real pressure

171
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:38,409
on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?

172
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,809
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.

173
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,971
Well, then, foreclose.

174
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,708
I can't do that. These families have children.

175
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,340
- Pop. - They're not my children.

176
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,351
But they're somebody's children, Mr. Potter.

177
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,978
Are you running a business or a charity ward?

178
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,182
- Well, all right... - Not with my money.

179
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,851
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character?

180
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,792
You have no family, no children.

181
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,727
You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.

182
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:02,062
I suppose I should give it to miserable failures

183
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,404
like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.

184
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:06,665
He's not a failure!

185
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:09,570
- You can't say that about my father. - George, George. Quiet, George.

186
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:11,006
You're not. You're the biggest man in town...

187
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,600
- Run along, run along. ...bigger than him,

188
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:14,839
- bigger than everybody. - Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

189
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:16,676
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

190
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:18,409
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

191
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,246
I'll talk to you tonight.

192
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:28,624
What?

193
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:32,027
Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago.

194
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:35,056
It will be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

195
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:41,268
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

196
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,966
I... You...

197
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,174
Didn't you hear what I said?

198
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,335
Yes, sir. I...

199
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,913
What kind of tricks are you playing anyway?

200
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,679
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

201
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:55,276
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

202
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,855
You're hurting my sore ear.

203
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,514
You lazy loafer.

204
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,524
Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing.

205
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,491
You put something wrong in those capsules.

206
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:03,823
I know you're unhappy.

207
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:05,590
You got the telegram, and you're upset.

208
00:11:05,698 --> 00:11:07,529
You put something bad in those capsules.

209
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:09,931
It wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

210
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,401
Just look and see what you did.

211
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,065
The bottle you took the powder from, it's poison.

212
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,835
I tell you, it's poison.

213
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:18,771
I know you feel bad.

214
00:11:23,883 --> 00:11:25,874
- Oh! - Don't hurt my sore ear again!

215
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:30,012
- Don't hurt my sore ear again. - Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

216
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:32,920
Oh, Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone.

217
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,390
I know how you're feeling.

218
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:37,121
I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.

219
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:39,094
Oh, George. George.

220
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:41,797
An overnight bag. Genuine English cowhide.

221
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,266
Combination lock.

222
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,668
- Fitted up with brushes, combs... - Nope, nope, nope, nope.

223
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:48,763
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

224
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:51,367
I want a big one.

225
00:11:52,011 --> 00:11:53,239
What did you stop it for?

226
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:56,576
I want you to take a good look at that face.

227
00:11:56,682 --> 00:11:57,671
Who is it?

228
00:11:57,783 --> 00:11:58,841
George Bailey.

229
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,920
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist?

230
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,283
That's the kid.

231
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,392
It's a good face. I like it.

232
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:09,256
I like George Bailey.

233
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,389
Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?

234
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,624
Not a soul.

235
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:16,731
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?

236
00:12:16,836 --> 00:12:18,531
Well, wait and see.

237
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,399
Big, see? I don't want one for one night.

238
00:12:21,507 --> 00:12:23,475
I want something for 1,001 nights

239
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:28,036
with plenty of room here for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand.

240
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,273
Great big thing, about...

241
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:31,508
- I see. A flying carpet, huh? - Yeah.

242
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:34,017
I don't suppose you'd like this old secondhand job, would you?

243
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,314
Now you're talking.

244
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,288
Gee whiz, I could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk.

245
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,585
- How much this cost? - No charge.

246
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,386
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded like you said "no charge."

247
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,463
That's right.

248
00:12:45,831 --> 00:12:47,355
Well, what's my name doing on it?

249
00:12:47,466 --> 00:12:50,492
A little present from old man Gower. Came down and picked it out himself.

250
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,970
He did? What do you know about that? My old boss. Isn't that nice?

251
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,563
What boat are you sailing on?

252
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:56,902
I'm working across on a cattle boat.

253
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,136
- A cattle boat? - Okay, I like cows.

254
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,381
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

255
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,916
Thanks ever so much for the baggage. It's just exactly what I wanted.

256
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:07,042
Forget it.

257
00:13:07,153 --> 00:13:09,713
- It's wonderful of you to think of me. - Hope you enjoy it.

258
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,619
I wish I had a million dollars.

259
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:12,918
Hot dog!

260
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,286
Avast there, Captain Cook!

261
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:17,589
- You got your sea legs yet?
- Parlez-vous Franais, mister?

262
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,960
Hey, send us some of those picture postcards, will you, George?

263
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:21,794
Hey, George, don't take any plug nickels.

264
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,528
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

265
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,796
Hey, Ernie!

266
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,371
- Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert. - Hiya, George.

267
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,236
- George. - Hey, I'm a rich tourist today.

268
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:30,774
How about driving me home in style?

269
00:13:30,876 --> 00:13:32,537
- Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in. - Yes, sir.

270
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,512
And for the carriage trade, I put on my hat.

271
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,343
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

272
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:40,645
Hello, Violet.

273
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:43,017
Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.

274
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,589
This old thing?

275
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,557
Why, I only wear it when I don't care how I look.

276
00:14:02,741 --> 00:14:05,107
- How would you like to take... - Yes.

277
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,206
Want to come along, Bert? We'll show you the town.

278
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,372
No, thanks.

279
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:12,712
I think I'll go home and see what the wife's doing.

280
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:15,884
Family man.

281
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,153
George, Harry, you're shaking the house down.

282
00:14:20,259 --> 00:14:21,317
Stop it.

283
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:24,055
Let them alone. I wish I was up there with them.

284
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:27,098
But Harry will tear his dinner suit. George!

285
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,099
That's why all children should be girls.

286
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,830
Well, if they were all girls there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

287
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,504
George, Harry, come down to dinner this minute.

288
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:38,600
Everything's getting cold, and you know how long we've been waiting for you.

289
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,406
- Okay, Ma. - Okay, Ma.

290
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,738
- Ta-da! - Ta-da!

291
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,847
- We got a present for you, Pop. - There you are.

292
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,989
Oh, you two idiots.

293
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:54,958
George, sit down and have dinner.

294
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,027
- Fine. - I've eaten.

295
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,393
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing for your graduating party? Look at you!

296
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,726
I don't care. It's George's tux.

297
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,391
Annie, my sweet, have you got those pies?

298
00:15:02,501 --> 00:15:05,095
If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit you with this broom!

299
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,672
Annie, I'm in love with you. There's a moon out tonight.

300
00:15:07,773 --> 00:15:11,732
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal in the old Bailey boarding house.

301
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:13,744
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

302
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,713
Pop, can I have the car? I gotta take over a lot of plates and things.

303
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:17,782
What plates?

304
00:15:17,883 --> 00:15:18,975
Mom, I'm chairman of the Eats Committee.

305
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,142
We only need a couple of dozen.

306
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,415
Oh, no, you don't, Harry. Now, not my best Haviland, no.

307
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,490
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

308
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,027
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are gonna miss you.

309
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:30,288
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

310
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,863
What's the matter? You look tired.

311
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,057
I had another tussle with Potter today.

312
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:36,225
I thought when we put him on the board of directors,

313
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:37,632
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

314
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:40,330
What's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

315
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,340
He's a sick man, frustrated, sick in his mind.

316
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,239
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

317
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:48,074
He hates everybody that has anything that he can't have.

318
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,841
He hates us mostly, I guess.

319
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,280
Gangway. Gangway.

320
00:15:51,383 --> 00:15:52,816
- So long, Pop. - So long.

321
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,886
- You got a match? - Very funny, very funny.

322
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:55,954
Put those things in the car,

323
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,250
and I'll get your tie and studs ready for you. Now, hurry up.

324
00:15:58,357 --> 00:15:59,619
- Okay, Mom. - Now, don't drop one of those.

325
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,885
You coming later, George?

326
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,255
What do you mean, and be bored to death?

327
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:04,192
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls,

328
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,854
and we're gonna use that new floor tonight, too.

329
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,057
- I hope it works. - No gin tonight, Son.

330
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,565
Oh, Pop, just a little?

331
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:10,464
No, Son. Not one drop.

332
00:16:10,869 --> 00:16:13,099
Boys and girls and music.

333
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,070
Why do they need gin?

334
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,938
Did I act like that when I graduated from high school?

335
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:19,169
Pretty much.

336
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,613
You know, George, I wish we could send Harry to college with you.

337
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,309
Your mother and I talked it over half the night.

338
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,248
We have that all figured out.

339
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:29,480
You see, Harry will take my job at the Building and Loan,

340
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:32,284
work there for four years, then he'll go.

341
00:16:32,758 --> 00:16:34,055
Pretty young for that job.

342
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:35,854
Well, no younger than I was.

343
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:38,259
Well, you were born older, George.

344
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,821
How's that?

345
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,594
I said you were born older.

346
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,293
I suppose you've decided what you want to do

347
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,665
when you get out of college.

348
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,500
Well, you know what I've always talked about,

349
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:51,007
build things, design new buildings, plan modern cities.

350
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,407
All that stuff I've been talking about.

351
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,274
Still after that first million before you're 30?

352
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,814
I'll settle for half that in cash.

353
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,510
Of course, it's just a hope.

354
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,849
But you wouldn't consider coming back

355
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:04,115
to the Building and Loan, would you?

356
00:17:05,724 --> 00:17:07,351
Well, I... I...

357
00:17:10,062 --> 00:17:12,087
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?

358
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:13,164
Then you'd be more comfortable,

359
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,755
and you could hear everything that's going on.

360
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:17,301
I would if I thought I'd hear anything worth listening to.

361
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:18,927
You would, eh?

362
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:21,233
I know it's soon to talk about it.

363
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,865
No, now, Pop, I couldn't.

364
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,910
I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life

365
00:17:27,012 --> 00:17:28,775
in a shabby little office.

366
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,214
I'm sorry, Pop. I didn't mean that, but I...

367
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,951
It's this business of nickels and dimes

368
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,216
and spending all your life trying to figure out

369
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,223
how to save three cents on a length of pipe.

370
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,351
I'd go crazy. I want to do something big and something important.

371
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:46,397
You know, George, I feel that, in a small way,

372
00:17:46,498 --> 00:17:48,398
we're doing something important,

373
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,695
satisfying a fundamental urge.

374
00:17:50,803 --> 00:17:55,069
It's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace.

375
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,108
And we're helping him get those things

376
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,836
in our shabby little office.

377
00:17:58,944 --> 00:18:02,573
I know, Pop. I know that.

378
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:04,710
I wish I felt that...

379
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,217
I've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to...

380
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,419
Most of my friends have already finished college.

381
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,918
I just feel like if I didn't get away, I'd bust.

382
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:20,657
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

383
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,461
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

384
00:18:22,568 --> 00:18:24,092
This town is no place for any man

385
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:26,467
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

386
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:29,063
Now, you've got talent, Son. I've seen it.

387
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:33,038
You get yourself an education and get out of here.

388
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:37,412
Pop, you want a shock?

389
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,043
I think you're a great guy.

390
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,888
- Why, did you hear that, Annie? - I heard it.

391
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,261
It's about time one of you lunkheads said it.

392
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:49,886
It's about time one of you lunkheads said it.

393
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,127
I'm gonna miss old Annie.

394
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,798
Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.

395
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:01,463
Have a good time, Son.

396
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:07,670
Excuse me.

397
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,304
There you are.

398
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,472
George, hello.

399
00:19:10,582 --> 00:19:11,742
You know my kid brother George.

400
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,818
- I'm gonna put him through college. - Hello, George.

401
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,181
Hee-haw!

402
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,652
Sam Wainwright.

403
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:18,279
How are you? When did you get here?

404
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,449
This afternoon. I thought I'd give the kids a treat.

405
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,924
Old college graduate now.

406
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:24,086
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright they call me.

407
00:19:24,196 --> 00:19:26,994
Well, freshman, looks like you're gonna make it after all, huh?

408
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:29,465
- Harry, you're the guy I want to see. - Hello, Sam.

409
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:31,593
- Coach has heard all about you. - He has?

410
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,534
Yeah, he's followed every game, and his mouth's watering.

411
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,766
He wants me to find out if you're gonna come along with us.

412
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,398
Well, I got to make some dough first.

413
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,034
Well, you better make it fast. We need great ends like you.

414
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:41,772
Not broken-down old guys like this one.

415
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,972
Hee-haw!

416
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,439
George, welcome back.

417
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:47,178
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

418
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,447
Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea.

419
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:50,852
Saved us another building.

420
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:52,787
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

421
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,655
There's lots of stuff here to eat and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.

422
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,626
A third dance... A third...

423
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:00,823
- Hello, Violet. - Hello. What am I bid?

424
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,093
George.

425
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,032
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

426
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,161
- Marty! - Sam, Harry, how are you?

427
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,136
- Do me a favor, will you, George? - What's that?

428
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
- You remember my kid sister Mary. - Oh, yeah. Yeah.

429
00:20:10,742 --> 00:20:13,006
"Mama wants you, Marty. Mama wants you." Remember?

430
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:14,442
Dance with her, will you?

431
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,640
Oh, me? Well, I feel funny enough already with all these kids.

432
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:18,773
Come on, be a sport.

433
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:22,183
Just dance with her one time, and you'll give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

434
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:23,777
Don't be long, Marty.

435
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:25,584
I'm not being a wet nurse to a...

436
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:27,659
The next thing I knew, some guy came up and tripped me.

437
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,659
That's the reason why I came in fourth.

438
00:20:29,761 --> 00:20:32,457
If it hadn't been for that, that race'd have been a cinch.

439
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:35,499
I tried to find out who it was later, but I couldn't find out.

440
00:20:35,601 --> 00:20:38,934
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was, because they'd be scared.

441
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:40,804
'Cause they know what kind of a guy I am.

442
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,999
You remember George. This is Mary.

443
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,735
Well, I'll be seeing you.

444
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:45,867
Well, well, well.

445
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:48,674
Now to get back to my story, see?

446
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:53,150
Hey, this is my dance.

447
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,220
Why don't you stop annoying people?

448
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,413
Well, I'm sorry. Hey!

449
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:03,052
- Well, hello. - Hello.

450
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:05,522
You look at me as if you didn't know me.

451
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:06,825
Well, I don't.

452
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,230
You've passed me on the street almost every day.

453
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:10,392
Me?

454
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:13,767
No. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

455
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:17,336
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! The big Charleston contest!

456
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:22,543
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

457
00:21:22,648 --> 00:21:25,412
Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor.

458
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,609
Let's go!

459
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:38,390
I'm not very good at this.

460
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,055
Neither am I.

461
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,996
Okay. What can we lose?

462
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,476
Hey, you're wonderful.

463
00:22:22,641 --> 00:22:25,109
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

464
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:29,972
Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor?

465
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:34,246
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?

466
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,485
And did you further know that George Bailey

467
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,888
is dancing right over that crack?

468
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,253
And I've got the key.

469
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,520
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

470
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,383
They're cheering us. We must be good.

471
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:55,799
Get out of there!

472
00:23:55,901 --> 00:23:57,391
What... Oh, well.

473
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,173
Buffalo gals can't you come out tonight?

474
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,576
Can't you come out tonight?

475
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,045
Can't you come out tonight?

476
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,616
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

477
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,513
And dance

478
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,618
By the light

479
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:24,218
Of the moon?

480
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,596
- Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ. - Beautiful.

481
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,860
I told Harry I thought I'd be bored to death.

482
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:32,198
You should have seen the commotion in that locker room.

483
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,034
I had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here.

484
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,005
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

485
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:38,735
Do I look as funny as you do?

486
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:40,675
I guess I'm not quite the football type.

487
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,474
You look wonderful!

488
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,245
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

489
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:46,909
I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.

490
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:49,953
Well, why don't you say it?

491
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:53,388
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?

492
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:55,519
Eighteen.

493
00:24:55,627 --> 00:24:59,085
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.

494
00:24:59,731 --> 00:25:01,130
Too young or too old?

495
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:03,929
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.

496
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,499
Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.

497
00:25:07,606 --> 00:25:10,939
I mean, without a dress you look older.

498
00:25:11,042 --> 00:25:13,943
I mean younger. You look... You just...

499
00:25:15,447 --> 00:25:16,971
I'm on the thing here.

500
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:19,016
Sir, my train, please.

501
00:25:19,117 --> 00:25:21,779
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

502
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,116
Your caboose, milady.

503
00:25:26,057 --> 00:25:28,116
You may kiss my hand.

504
00:25:30,595 --> 00:25:32,028
Hey.

505
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,396
Hey, Mary.

506
00:25:36,334 --> 00:25:39,497
As I was lumberin' down the street

507
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,004
Down the street, down the street

508
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,707
Okay, then. I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.

509
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,073
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.

510
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:49,408
No, you see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass.

511
00:25:49,514 --> 00:25:50,947
And you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

512
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,916
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place.

513
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:55,884
I'd like to live in it.

514
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:57,110
In that place?

515
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,520
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now, watch.

516
00:25:59,624 --> 00:26:02,218
Right in the second floor, there. See?

517
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,124
What did you wish, George?

518
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,633
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

519
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:12,268
Mary, I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

520
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:15,498
and the next day and next year and the year after that.

521
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,440
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet,

522
00:26:18,543 --> 00:26:20,272
and I'm gonna see the world!

523
00:26:20,378 --> 00:26:23,438
Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum.

524
00:26:23,548 --> 00:26:26,176
Then I'm coming back here and go to college to see what they know.

525
00:26:26,284 --> 00:26:27,876
And then I'm gonna build things.

526
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:29,385
I'm gonna build airfields.

527
00:26:29,487 --> 00:26:31,853
I'm gonna build skyscrapers 100 stories high.

528
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:34,323
I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

529
00:26:34,726 --> 00:26:36,785
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

530
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,593
Hey, that's pretty good.

531
00:26:43,335 --> 00:26:45,269
What did you wish, Mary?

532
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:50,268
Buffalo gals can't you come out tonight?

533
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:51,603
Can't you come out tonight?

534
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,234
Can't you come out tonight?

535
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:56,346
Buffalo gals, can't you come out tonight

536
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,440
And

537
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,544
Dance by the light of the moon?

538
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,589
What did you wish when you threw that rock?

539
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:07,089
- Oh, no. - Come on, tell me.

540
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,750
If I told you, it might not come true.

541
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:10,589
What is it you want, Mary?

542
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,157
What do you want? You want the moon?

543
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:17,130
Just say the word, and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.

544
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:20,932
Hey, that's a pretty good idea. I'll give you the moon, Mary.

545
00:27:21,172 --> 00:27:22,571
I'll take it.

546
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,065
Then what?

547
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:28,034
Well, then you could swallow it, and it would all dissolve, see?

548
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,914
And the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes

549
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,008
and the ends of your hair.

550
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:38,083
- Am I talking too much? - Yes!

551
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,388
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?

552
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,517
How's that?

553
00:27:42,627 --> 00:27:46,063
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?

554
00:27:47,732 --> 00:27:49,290
You want me to kiss her, huh?

555
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,768
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

556
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,205
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister. Come on back out here!

557
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:01,506
I'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you...

558
00:28:08,887 --> 00:28:09,945
Mary?

559
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,100
Okay, I give up. Where are you?

560
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,303
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

561
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:28,869
Here you are. Catch.

562
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:32,373
Wait a minute. What am I doing?

563
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:39,105
This is a very interesting situation.

564
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,014
Please give me my robe.

565
00:28:42,921 --> 00:28:45,617
A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.

566
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,988
I'd like to have my robe.

567
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:49,321
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

568
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,622
- Ouch! Oh! - Gesundheit.

569
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,394
- George Bailey! - This requires a little thought here.

570
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,126
Give me my robe.

571
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,634
I've read about things like this, but I've never...

572
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,865
Shame on you! I'm gonna tell your mother on you.

573
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,567
My mother's way up on the corner there.

574
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,610
I'll call the police.

575
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:09,475
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.

576
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,412
Then I'm going to scream!

577
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:13,913
Maybe I could sell tickets.

578
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,154
Let's see. No, the point is

579
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,918
in order to get this robe... I've got it.

580
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,920
I'll make a deal with you, Mary.

581
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:25,325
George! George!

582
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:30,097
George, come on home! Quick!

583
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,567
- Your father's had a stroke. - What?

584
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:35,972
- Mary, Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go. - Come on, George, let's hurry.

585
00:29:36,074 --> 00:29:37,405
- Did you get a doctor? - Yes.

586
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:39,306
Campbell's there now.

587
00:29:49,554 --> 00:29:51,146
I think that's all we'll need you for, George.

588
00:29:51,256 --> 00:29:54,089
- I know you're anxious to make a train. - I have a taxi waiting downstairs.

589
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,990
I want the board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe

590
00:29:57,095 --> 00:29:59,825
to help straighten things out here these past few months.

591
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,796
Good luck to you at school, George.

592
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,834
- Good luck, George. - Goodbye, George.

593
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:06,529
And now we come to the real purpose of this meeting,

594
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,300
to appoint a successor to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

595
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:11,534
Mr. Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose.

596
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,838
- Wait just a minute now. - Wait for what?

597
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:17,278
I claim this institution is not necessary to this town.

598
00:30:17,382 --> 00:30:21,216
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution

599
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,584
and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.

600
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,623
Potter, you dirty, contemptible... I'll wring his neck.

601
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:27,713
George, did you hear what that buzzard...

602
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,020
Mr. Chairman.

603
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,719
It's too soon after Peter Bailey's death

604
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,127
to talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.

605
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:35,631
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

606
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:37,530
I second Mr. Potter's motion.

607
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:39,034
Very well. In that case,

608
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,971
I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. But before you go,

609
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:46,202
I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow

610
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,472
- at the passing of Peter Bailey. - Thank you very much.

611
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,514
It was his faith and devotion

612
00:30:50,615 --> 00:30:52,139
that are responsible for this organization.

613
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,150
I'll go further than that.

614
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:58,655
I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.

615
00:30:58,756 --> 00:31:00,951
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

616
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,027
considering that you probably drove him to his grave.

617
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,925
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

618
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,463
That's what killed him.

619
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,261
Oh, I don't mean any disrespect to him. God rest his soul.

620
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,804
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

621
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:18,003
But ideals without common sense can ruin this town.

622
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,741
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop,

623
00:31:21,846 --> 00:31:25,145
you know, that fellow that sits around all day

624
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,014
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

625
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:31,919
I happen to know the bank turned down this loan.

626
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,684
But he comes here,

627
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:38,524
and we're building him a house worth $5,000.

628
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:41,730
- Why? - Well, I handled that, Mr. Potter.

629
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,666
You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance.

630
00:31:44,769 --> 00:31:46,464
I can personally vouch for his character.

631
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,436
- A friend of yours? - Yes, sir.

632
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:52,439
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here,

633
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,738
you can come and borrow money.

634
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:56,946
What does that get us?

635
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:59,915
A discontented, lazy rabble

636
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,883
instead of a thrifty working class.

637
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,786
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers

638
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,053
like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads

639
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,390
with a lot of impossible ideas.

640
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,293
Now, I say...

641
00:32:13,398 --> 00:32:16,231
Just a minute. Just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

642
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:19,565
You're right when you say my father was no businessman. I know that.

643
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,299
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante Building and Loan

644
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:23,465
I'll never know.

645
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:26,407
But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character,

646
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,206
because his whole life was...

647
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,907
Why, in the 25 years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing,

648
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:33,313
he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?

649
00:32:33,418 --> 00:32:36,251
He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.

650
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:39,084
But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

651
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,251
And what's wrong with that? Why, here, you're all businessmen here.

652
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,592
Don't it make them better citizens, and doesn't it make them better customers?

653
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,893
You said that they... What'd you say just a minute ago?

654
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,797
They had to wait and save their money

655
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:52,335
before they even thought of a decent home.

656
00:32:52,437 --> 00:32:54,098
Wait? Wait for what?

657
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,866
Until their children grow up and leave them?

658
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,135
Until they're so old and broken-down that they...

659
00:32:58,242 --> 00:33:00,836
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000?

660
00:33:00,945 --> 00:33:04,312
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about,

661
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:08,317
they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.

662
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:10,853
Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die

663
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:12,718
in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?

664
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,883
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

665
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,857
People were human beings to him, but to you,

666
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,863
a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.

667
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,830
Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.

668
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:25,459
I'm not interested in your book.

669
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:28,334
I'm talking about the Building and Loan.

670
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,100
I know very well what you're talking about.

671
00:33:30,208 --> 00:33:32,506
You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on,

672
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,408
and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know.

673
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:37,777
Well, I've said too much. I...

674
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,184
You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing.

675
00:33:41,285 --> 00:33:42,843
There's just one thing more, though.

676
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:45,548
This town needs this measly one-horse institution

677
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:49,183
if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter.

678
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,294
Come on, Uncle Billy.

679
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:59,800
Sentimental hogwash. I want my motion.

680
00:34:02,006 --> 00:34:04,497
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him, George, old boy.

681
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:06,406
You shut his big mouth. You should have heard him.

682
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,172
What happened? We heard a lot of yelling.

683
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:10,907
Well, we're being voted out of business after 25 years.

684
00:34:11,015 --> 00:34:14,473
- Easy come, easy go. - Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

685
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:16,553
You still want me to hang around, George?

686
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,145
- Yeah, I'll be right down. - Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

687
00:34:19,257 --> 00:34:21,054
You're a week late for school already. Go on.

688
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,923
- What's going on in there? - Never mind. Don't worry about that.

689
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,054
They're putting us out of business. So what? I can get another job.

690
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:28,860
- I'm only 55. - 56.

691
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,298
Go on, go on. Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

692
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,960
now you don't want to miss college, too, do you?

693
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,505
George! George! They voted Potter down.

694
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:37,369
They want to keep it going.

695
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,933
You did it, George. You did it.

696
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,205
They got one condition, only one condition.

697
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:43,871
- What's that? - And that's the best part of it.

698
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,972
They've appointed George here as Executive Secretary

699
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,346
to take his father's place.

700
00:34:47,452 --> 00:34:50,285
- Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy... - You can keep him on. That's all right.

701
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:52,288
As Secretary, you can hire anyone you like.

702
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,984
Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. I'm leaving.

703
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,685
I'm leaving right now. I'm going to school.

704
00:34:56,794 --> 00:34:59,262
This is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

705
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:02,161
But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

706
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:07,004
- I know, I know, he didn't go. - That's right.

707
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:10,432
Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother, Harry,

708
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:12,008
and sent him to college.

709
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,975
Harry became a football star.

710
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:15,875
Made second team all-American.

711
00:35:16,247 --> 00:35:18,044
Yeah, but what happened to George?

712
00:35:18,149 --> 00:35:21,209
George got four years older, waiting for Harry to come back

713
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,344
and take over the Building and Loans.

714
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,055
There are plenty of jobs around for somebody that likes to travel.

715
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:27,283
Look at this. Here.

716
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:31,122
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted, man with construction experience."

717
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:33,527
Here's the Yukon, right here.

718
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,963
"Wanted, man with engineering experience."

719
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,932
There she blows.

720
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:41,903
You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are?

721
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:44,236
Breakfast is served. Lunch is served. Dinner...

722
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,039
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles.

723
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,273
- Peanut? - There's the professor now.

724
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:52,679
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa all-American Baily.

725
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,808
Why, old George "Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

726
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,479
What? No husky dogs? No sled? Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

727
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:59,078
Nobody ever changes here, you know that.

728
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,851
Oh, am I glad to see you.

729
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,119
- Say, where's Mother? - She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

730
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,058
- Come on, let's go. - Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

731
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,098
George, Uncle Billy, I want you to meet Ruth.

732
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,530
- Hello. - How do you do?

733
00:36:09,634 --> 00:36:12,364
- Ruth Dakin. - Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

734
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,836
- Huh? - Well, I wired you I had a surprise.

735
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,531
Here she is. Meet the wife.

736
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:19,439
Well, what do you know? A wife.

737
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:23,304
- Well, how do you do? Congratulations. - How do you do?

738
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,115
What am I doing? Congratulations!

739
00:36:26,217 --> 00:36:27,946
- Doggone it, Harry, you... - They're married!

740
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,179
Why don't you tell somebody?

741
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:32,813
Come on, Mrs. Bailey, I can't wait to see everybody's reaction.

742
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:34,323
- You're really married? - Why, yes.

743
00:36:34,425 --> 00:36:36,120
What's a pretty girl like you doing

744
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,161
marrying this two-headed brother of mine?

745
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,958
Well, I'll tell you. It's purely mercenary. My father offered him a job.

746
00:36:41,065 --> 00:36:45,161
Oh, he got you and the job? Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

747
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:49,839
George, about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. I never said I'd take it.

748
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:52,769
You've been holding the bag here for four years, and,

749
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:55,641
well, I won't let you down, George. I would like to...

750
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:58,874
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot the bags. I'll be right back.

751
00:36:58,983 --> 00:37:00,644
It was a surprise to me.

752
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:02,742
This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.

753
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:06,016
- How are you? - Old, old friend of the Baileys.

754
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:08,648
Oh, really? What are their names? Let's see...

755
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,285
Oh, of course, I've heard him speak of you.

756
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,762
And I want to tell you, we're gonna give the biggest party

757
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:16,298
this town ever saw.

758
00:37:19,136 --> 00:37:20,797
Here, have some popcorn.

759
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,437
George, George, George. That's all Harry ever talks about.

760
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:27,769
Ruth, this...

761
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:29,071
What about this job?

762
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,546
Well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo.

763
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:34,379
He wants to get Harry started in the research business.

764
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:36,646
- Well, is it a good job? - Oh, yes, very.

765
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,382
Not much money, but good future, you know.

766
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,822
- Yeah. - Harry's a genius at research.

767
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,293
- My father just fell in love with him. - And you did, too.

768
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:00,944
Hey, Joe.

769
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,878
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. I feel so good.

770
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:09,385
I could spit in Potter's eye. I think I will. I think I will.

771
00:38:10,187 --> 00:38:11,950
What did you say? Huh?

772
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,788
Maybe I'd better go home.

773
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:17,156
Where's my hat? Where's my...

774
00:38:17,528 --> 00:38:21,123
- Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine? - The middle one.

775
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:24,258
Oh, thank you, George. Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

776
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:27,701
if you'll point me in the right direction... Would you do that, George?

777
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:28,931
Right down here.

778
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,736
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

779
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:34,106
Now you just turn this way and then right straight down there.

780
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:35,269
Oh, that way, huh?

781
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,640
My wild Irish rose

782
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:46,315
I'm all right. I'm all right.

783
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:29,857
Hello, Ma.

784
00:39:32,069 --> 00:39:33,661
That's for nothing.

785
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:37,267
- How do you like her? - She's swell, isn't she?

786
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:40,506
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.

787
00:39:40,611 --> 00:39:42,909
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

788
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,846
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?

789
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,577
Came back three days ago.

790
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,786
Nice girl, Mary.

791
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,423
Kind that'll help you find the answers, George.

792
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:00,930
Stop that grunting.

793
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:06,468
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?

794
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,060
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

795
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,000
- Hee-haw? - Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

796
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,405
- Well, she's not crazy about him. - Well, how do you know?

797
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,239
- What, did she discuss it with you? - No.

798
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,041
- Well, then how do you know? - Well, I've got eyes, haven't I?

799
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:20,276
Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.

800
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,084
Besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

801
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:28,147
- and you're here in Bedford Falls. - And all's fair in love and war.

802
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,457
I don't know about war.

803
00:40:33,864 --> 00:40:37,595
Mother of mine, I can see right through you right to your back-collar button.

804
00:40:37,701 --> 00:40:39,669
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

805
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,741
Well, here's your hat. What's your hurry?

806
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,711
All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal,

807
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:52,044
I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.

808
00:40:52,149 --> 00:40:53,343
Oh, George.

809
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,443
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction...

810
00:40:57,822 --> 00:40:59,119
This direction.

811
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,991
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

812
00:41:19,376 --> 00:41:22,072
- Excuse me. - Now, wait a minute.

813
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:24,306
I think I got a date.

814
00:41:24,415 --> 00:41:27,111
But stick around, fellows, just in case, huh?

815
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:30,181
We'll wait for you, baby.

816
00:41:32,122 --> 00:41:34,283
- Hello, Georgie Porgie! - Hello Vi.

817
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,618
- What gives? - Nothing.

818
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:39,956
Where are you going?

819
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:42,897
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.

820
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:47,334
Georgie, don't you ever get tired of just reading about things?

821
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,473
Yes.

822
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,808
- What are you doing tonight? - Not a thing.

823
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,207
Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night of it.

824
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:57,473
I'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

825
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,478
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes

826
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,017
- and walk through the grass. - Huh?

827
00:42:02,119 --> 00:42:04,986
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

828
00:42:05,089 --> 00:42:09,253
and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it.

829
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:13,092
Then we can climb Mount Bedford and smell the pines

830
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,824
and watch the sunrise against the peaks,

831
00:42:14,932 --> 00:42:16,365
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

832
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:18,697
and everybody'll be talking. There'll be a terrific scandal.

833
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:22,533
Georgie, have you gone crazy? Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?

834
00:42:23,474 --> 00:42:25,635
Why it's 10 miles up to Mount Bedford.

835
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:30,103
- Lf you think... - Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

836
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:51,166
- What are you doing, picketing? - Hello, Mary.

837
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,328
I just happened to be passing by here.

838
00:42:54,471 --> 00:42:56,234
Yes, so I noticed.

839
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:59,169
- Have you made up your mind? - How's that?

840
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,904
- Have you made up your mind? - About what?

841
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:03,343
About coming in.

842
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,005
Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over

843
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,880
- to pay me a visit. - My mother just called you?

844
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,351
Well, how did she know?

845
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:12,422
- Didn't you tell her? - I didn't tell anybody.

846
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:15,321
I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by here.

847
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,916
What do you...

848
00:43:18,796 --> 00:43:20,593
Went for a walk. That's all.

849
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:24,866
- I'll be downstairs, Mother. - All right, dear.

850
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:48,854
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

851
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:51,421
Well, I'll come in for a minute.

852
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:54,862
But I...

853
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:10,037
I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here, you know.

854
00:44:11,615 --> 00:44:14,311
- When did you get back? - Tuesday.

855
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,384
Where did you get that dress?

856
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:20,013
- Do you like it? - It's all right.

857
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:26,295
I thought you would go back to New York,

858
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,729
like Sam and Angie and the rest of them.

859
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,727
I worked there a couple of vacations, but I don't know.

860
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,202
I guess I was homesick.

861
00:44:35,305 --> 00:44:38,274
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

862
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:41,534
Yes, and my family and...

863
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:43,940
Everything.

864
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,976
Would you like to sit down?

865
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,881
All right, for a minute.

866
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:51,648
I still can't understand it, though.

867
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,882
You know, I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.

868
00:44:53,991 --> 00:44:55,322
Would you rather leave?

869
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:57,257
No. I don't want to be rude.

870
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,851
Well, then, sit down.

871
00:44:59,096 --> 00:45:00,256
What's that?

872
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:04,823
Some joke, huh?

873
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,133
Well...

874
00:45:12,009 --> 00:45:15,376
I see it still smells like pine needles around here.

875
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,238
Thank you.

876
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,250
And dance by the

877
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,122
What's the matter?

878
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,017
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

879
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,059
Well...

880
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,497
Nice about your brother Harry and Ruth, isn't it?

881
00:45:37,601 --> 00:45:39,660
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

882
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,095
Don't you like her?

883
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:43,639
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.

884
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,744
Oh, just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

885
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:53,340
No. Marriage is all right for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

886
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:55,145
Mary! Mary!

887
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,617
Who's down there with you?

888
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,551
It's George Bailey, Mother.

889
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,349
George Bailey? What's he want?

890
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:02,955
I don't know.

891
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:04,758
What do you want?

892
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:08,293
Me? Not a thing.

893
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:10,389
I just came in to get warm.

894
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,530
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

895
00:46:16,206 --> 00:46:19,334
You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either!

896
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,537
Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight.

897
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:25,638
What's your mother mean? You know, I didn't come here to...

898
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:28,240
- What did you come here for, then? - I don't know. You tell me.

899
00:46:28,352 --> 00:46:30,946
You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers. You tell me.

900
00:46:31,054 --> 00:46:32,885
- Why don't you go home? - That's where I'm going.

901
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,617
I don't know why I came here in the first place.

902
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,158
- Good night. - Good night!

903
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:39,252
Mary! Mary! The telephone. It's Sam.

904
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:40,557
I'll get it.

905
00:46:40,764 --> 00:46:43,426
Whatever were you doing that you couldn't hear?

906
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:54,773
Mary, he's waiting.

907
00:46:58,248 --> 00:46:59,306
Hello?

908
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,615
Forgot my hat.

909
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:07,852
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

910
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,984
I'm great. Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

911
00:47:11,094 --> 00:47:13,858
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

912
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:18,097
There's an old friend of yours here. George Bailey.

913
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,102
You mean old mossback George?

914
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,804
Yes, old mossback George.

915
00:47:22,906 --> 00:47:24,840
Hee-haw! Put him on.

916
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:27,206
Wait just a minute. I'll call him. George!

917
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:29,472
He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot.

918
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,411
He does so. He asked for him.

919
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,944
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

920
00:47:39,389 --> 00:47:40,378
Hi, Sam.

921
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:44,290
Well, George Bailyoffski! Hey, a fine pal you are.

922
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:46,225
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?

923
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,297
What do you mean?

924
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:49,194
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

925
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,199
Here... Here's Mary.

926
00:47:51,301 --> 00:47:53,633
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I want to talk to both of you.

927
00:47:53,737 --> 00:47:55,204
Tell Mary to get on the extension.

928
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,570
- Mother's on the extension. We... - I am not!

929
00:47:58,909 --> 00:48:00,706
We can both hear. Come here.

930
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:03,512
We're listening, Sam.

931
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:07,141
Well, look, I have a big deal coming up that's gonna make us all rich.

932
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:09,811
George, do you remember that night in Martini's bar

933
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,583
when you told me you'd read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?

934
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:15,817
- Chili beans. - Shut up, will you?

935
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:18,588
You remember, out of chili... Out of soybeans.

936
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,897
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

937
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,298
Well, listen, Dad snapped up the idea,

938
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,893
and he's gonna build a factory outside of Rochester.

939
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,495
How do you like that?

940
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:34,438
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

941
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,240
Well, why not? Can you think of anything better?

942
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,979
Well, I don't know. Just why not right here?

943
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:44,781
You remember that old tool and machinery works?

944
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,879
You tell your father he can get that for a song.

945
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,252
And all the labor he wants, too.

946
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:50,792
Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.

947
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,158
That so? Well, I'll tell him.

948
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:54,594
Hey, that sounds great.

949
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,529
Oh, baby, I knew you'd come through.

950
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:59,659
Now here's the point, Mary. Mary, you're in on this, too.

951
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,170
Now listen. Have you got any money?

952
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:06,876
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

953
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:07,944
Well, now, listen.

954
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,208
I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, do you hear?

955
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:14,011
And, George, I may have a job for you,

956
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:18,053
that is unless you're still married to that broken-down Building and Loan.

957
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,350
Well, this is the biggest thing since radio,

958
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,550
and I'm letting you in on the ground floor.

959
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:24,684
Oh, Mary. Mary?

960
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:28,589
I'm here.

961
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:30,962
Would you tell that guy

962
00:49:31,068 --> 00:49:33,093
I'm giving him the chance of a lifetime, do you hear?

963
00:49:33,203 --> 00:49:35,034
The chance of a lifetime!

964
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:40,935
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

965
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:45,971
Now you listen to me.

966
00:49:46,249 --> 00:49:49,218
I don't want any plastics, and I don't want any ground floors.

967
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,253
And I don't want to get married, ever, to anyone.

968
00:49:51,355 --> 00:49:52,754
You understand that?

969
00:49:52,856 --> 00:49:54,790
I want to do what I want to do.

970
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,917
And you're... And you're...

971
00:49:58,028 --> 00:50:01,486
- Oh, Mary, Mary. - George, George, George.

972
00:50:04,267 --> 00:50:05,495
Oh, Mary.

973
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:10,631
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

974
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,469
Mary...

975
00:50:14,611 --> 00:50:15,703
Here they come! Here they come!

976
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:43,066
Goodbye, George!

977
00:50:46,276 --> 00:50:47,743
Goodbye!

978
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,709
First Harry, now George.

979
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,982
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

980
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,183
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

981
00:51:04,861 --> 00:51:08,228
If either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.

982
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:12,901
Hey, look. There's somebody driving this cab.

983
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,800
Bert the cop sent this over.

984
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:17,271
He said to float away to Happyland on the bubbles.

985
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:19,535
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

986
00:51:19,643 --> 00:51:22,806
By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon?

987
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:25,006
Where are we going? Look at this.

988
00:51:25,115 --> 00:51:27,481
There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.

989
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:29,643
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

990
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:32,119
You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna shoot the works.

991
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,452
A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda.

992
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:36,992
The highest hotels, the oldest champagne,

993
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:41,588
the richest caviar, the hottest music and the prettiest wife.

994
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,928
That does it! Then what?

995
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:47,003
- Then what, honey? - After that, who cares?

996
00:51:47,504 --> 00:51:49,438
That does it, come here. Come here.

997
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,166
Don't look now, but there's something funny

998
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,472
going on over there at the bank, George.

999
00:51:56,580 --> 00:52:00,573
I've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.

1000
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:11,117
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry.

1001
00:52:11,228 --> 00:52:12,957
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

1002
00:52:13,063 --> 00:52:14,530
Just a minute, dear.

1003
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:21,094
- Please, let's not stop, George. - I'll be back in a minute, Mary.

1004
00:52:37,687 --> 00:52:40,178
Well, hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

1005
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:43,088
Charlie? What's the matter here, can't you get in?

1006
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,673
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

1007
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,105
George.

1008
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,807
Come on in, everybody. That's right. Just come on in.

1009
00:53:09,085 --> 00:53:10,313
Look out, you.

1010
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,148
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

1011
00:53:14,257 --> 00:53:16,418
There are a lot of seats over there.

1012
00:53:17,427 --> 00:53:19,292
Just make yourselves at home.

1013
00:53:20,897 --> 00:53:23,297
George, can I see you a minute?

1014
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:26,130
- Why didn't you call me? - I just did, but they said you left.

1015
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:27,794
This is a pickle, George. This is a pickle.

1016
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:29,428
All right, now, what happened? How did it start?

1017
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,631
How does a thing like this ever start?

1018
00:53:30,740 --> 00:53:32,401
- All I know is the bank called our loan. - When?

1019
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,670
About an hour ago. I handed over all our cash.

1020
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,109
- All of it? - Every cent of it,

1021
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:38,579
- and still it was less than we owe them. - Holy mackerel!

1022
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,775
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors.

1023
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:42,511
I... I...

1024
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,317
The whole town's gone crazy.

1025
00:53:46,423 --> 00:53:47,720
Yeah, hello?

1026
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:49,949
George, it's Potter.

1027
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:54,588
Hello?

1028
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,862
George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.

1029
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,402
Is that true?

1030
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,201
Oh, well, I'm very glad to hear that.

1031
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:06,639
George, are you all right? Do you need any police?

1032
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,074
Police? What for?

1033
00:54:08,345 --> 00:54:12,145
Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know.

1034
00:54:12,449 --> 00:54:16,909
George, I'm going all out to help in this crisis.

1035
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:22,191
I've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.

1036
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:25,892
They'll close up for a week and then reopen.

1037
00:54:26,796 --> 00:54:28,559
He just took over the bank.

1038
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:30,457
I may lose a fortune,

1039
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:34,401
but I'm willing to guarantee your people, too.

1040
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,972
Just tell them to bring their shares over here,

1041
00:54:37,073 --> 00:54:39,633
and I will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

1042
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,836
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

1043
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:43,105
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

1044
00:54:43,213 --> 00:54:46,876
If you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen.

1045
00:54:55,725 --> 00:54:57,158
George, was it a nice wedding?

1046
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:59,228
Gosh, I wanted to be there.

1047
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:00,687
Yeah.

1048
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,497
You can take this one off now.

1049
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:18,712
Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appeared.

1050
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,322
I have some news for you, folks.

1051
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,826
I was just talking to old man Potter,

1052
00:55:31,928 --> 00:55:33,520
and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.

1053
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,154
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

1054
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:37,165
But, George, I got my money here.

1055
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,825
Did he guarantee this place?

1056
00:55:38,935 --> 00:55:41,927
Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him. We don't need Potter over here.

1057
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:43,699
Then, I'll take mine now.

1058
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,732
No, but you're...

1059
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,635
You're thinking of this place all wrong,

1060
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:52,340
as if I had the money back in a safe. The money's not here.

1061
00:55:52,449 --> 00:55:54,940
Well, your money's in Joe's house. That's right next to yours.

1062
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:57,281
And in the Kennedy house and Mrs. Macklin's house

1063
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:58,877
and 100 others.

1064
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:00,546
Why, you're lending them the money to build,

1065
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:02,682
and then, they're gonna pay it back to you as best they can.

1066
00:56:02,792 --> 00:56:04,419
Now, what are you gonna do, foreclose on them?

1067
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:10,523
I got $242 in here, and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

1068
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:13,994
Okay, Tom. All right.

1069
00:56:14,270 --> 00:56:16,830
Here you are. You sign this. You'll get your money in 60 days.

1070
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,066
Sixty days?

1071
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:20,199
Now, that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares.

1072
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:22,403
- Tom! Tom, did you get your money? - No.

1073
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:23,501
Well, I did.

1074
00:56:23,613 --> 00:56:26,241
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents on the dollar for every share you've got.

1075
00:56:26,349 --> 00:56:28,909
- Fifty cents on the dollar! - Yes, cash!

1076
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:30,576
Well, what do you say?

1077
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:33,281
Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement.

1078
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,721
Now, give us 60 days on this.

1079
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,849
- Okay, Randall. - Are you going to go to Potter's?

1080
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,053
Better to get half than nothing.

1081
00:56:39,162 --> 00:56:41,187
Tom! Tom!

1082
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,428
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

1083
00:56:43,867 --> 00:56:47,633
Now, listen. Now, listen to me. I beg of you not to do this thing.

1084
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:49,796
If Potter gets a hold of this Building and Loan,

1085
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,840
there'll never be another decent house built in this town.

1086
00:56:51,941 --> 00:56:53,431
He's already got charge of the bank.

1087
00:56:53,543 --> 00:56:55,568
He's got the bus line. He got the department stores.

1088
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:58,374
And now he's after us. Why? Well, it's very simple.

1089
00:56:58,481 --> 00:57:00,711
Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.

1090
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,910
And because he wants to keep you living in his slums

1091
00:57:03,019 --> 00:57:04,884
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1092
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:06,922
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you?

1093
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:07,990
Well, have you forgotten?

1094
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,457
Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack?

1095
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:13,654
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last year when things weren't going so well

1096
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:14,923
and you couldn't make your payments.

1097
00:57:15,031 --> 00:57:16,464
Well, you didn't lose your house, did you?

1098
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,295
You think Potter would've let you keep it?

1099
00:57:18,401 --> 00:57:21,063
Can't you understand what's happening here?

1100
00:57:21,171 --> 00:57:22,729
Don't you see what's happening?

1101
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,535
Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying, and why?

1102
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:27,803
Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why.

1103
00:57:27,911 --> 00:57:29,105
He's picking up some bargain.

1104
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,544
Now we can get through this thing all right.

1105
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,445
We've got to stick together, though.

1106
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,017
We've got to have faith in each other.

1107
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:38,315
But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and I need money.

1108
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:40,116
How am going to live until the bank opens?

1109
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:42,521
- I got doctor bills to pay. - I need cash.

1110
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,525
I can't feed my kids on faith.

1111
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,288
How much do you need?

1112
00:57:46,396 --> 00:57:49,832
Hey! I got $2,000.

1113
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,968
Here's $2,000. This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.

1114
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,833
- All right, Tom, how much do you need? - $242.

1115
00:57:55,939 --> 00:57:58,430
Tom, just enough to tide you over until the bank reopens.

1116
00:57:58,541 --> 00:58:00,702
I'll take $242.

1117
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:05,276
- There you are. - That'll close my account.

1118
00:58:05,381 --> 00:58:07,679
Your account's still here. That's a loan.

1119
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,117
- Okay. All right, Ed? - I got $300 here, George.

1120
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:14,782
Now, Ed, what'll it take till the bank opens? What do you need?

1121
00:58:14,891 --> 00:58:17,223
Well, I suppose $20.

1122
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,125
$20. Now you're talking. Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

1123
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,822
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson, how much do you want?

1124
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,193
But it's your own money, George.

1125
00:58:23,299 --> 00:58:24,960
Never mind about that. How much do you want?

1126
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,127
- I can get along with $20, all right. - $20, fine.

1127
00:58:27,237 --> 00:58:29,364
- And I'll sign the paper. - You don't have to sign anything.

1128
00:58:29,472 --> 00:58:31,565
I know you. You pay it when you can. That's okay.

1129
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,041
- All right, Mrs. Davis? - Could I have $17.50?

1130
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:40,280
Bless your heart. Of course you can have it. You got 50 cents?

1131
00:58:40,383 --> 00:58:41,748
- Seven... - We're gonna make it, George.

1132
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,341
...six... - They'll never close us up today!

1133
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:47,913
...five, four, three, two,

1134
00:58:48,091 --> 00:58:50,150
one, bingo!

1135
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:51,887
We made it! Close the door, Eustace! We made it.

1136
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,896
Look, look, we're still in business. We've still got 2 bucks left.

1137
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,795
Look, let's have some of that. Let's celebrate!

1138
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,299
Get some glasses, Tilly.

1139
00:58:58,401 --> 00:59:01,632
- Well, a couple of financial wizards. - Call us Rockefellers.

1140
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:04,229
Get a tray for these two great big important simoleons here.

1141
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:05,864
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1142
00:59:05,975 --> 00:59:09,411
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar and to Papa Dollar,

1143
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:11,605
and if you want to keep this old Building and Loan in business,

1144
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,181
you better have a family real quick.

1145
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:16,081
- I wish they were rabbits. - I wish they were, too.

1146
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,211
Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens.

1147
00:59:26,696 --> 00:59:27,822
Close the door.

1148
00:59:27,931 --> 00:59:29,831
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

1149
00:59:29,933 --> 00:59:33,334
Wedding. Holy mackerel, I'm married.

1150
00:59:33,436 --> 00:59:36,064
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

1151
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:38,299
Look, I got a train to catch. Well, the train's gone.

1152
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:40,774
I wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab.

1153
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:43,277
George, there's a call for you.

1154
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:44,676
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?

1155
00:59:44,781 --> 00:59:46,146
She's probably over at her mother's.

1156
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:47,717
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

1157
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:49,875
I don't want Mrs. Bailey. I want my wife.

1158
00:59:49,986 --> 00:59:53,513
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife. Here, I'll take it in here.

1159
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,949
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, I'm sorry.

1160
00:59:57,427 --> 01:00:01,090
Huh? Come home? What home?

1161
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:05,595
320 Sycamore? Well, what... Whose home is that?

1162
01:00:06,469 --> 01:00:08,630
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1163
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:22,274
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.

1164
01:00:22,385 --> 01:00:24,353
How would you like to get a ticket next week?

1165
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,751
You got any romance in you?

1166
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:28,415
- Sure, I had it, but I got rid of it. - Liver pills.

1167
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,015
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?

1168
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:33,527
What we want is romantic places, beautiful places,

1169
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,427
places George wants to go.

1170
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,528
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

1171
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:39,863
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.

1172
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:41,834
- Who? - The groom, idiot.

1173
01:00:41,938 --> 01:00:43,803
This is their honeymoon. Come on. Get that ladder.

1174
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:45,396
What are they, ducks?

1175
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,474
- Get that ladder up here. - All right, all right.

1176
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,378
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. - I'm hurrying.

1177
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:05,086
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

1178
01:02:30,513 --> 01:02:33,004
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1179
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,550
Well, I'll be...

1180
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,423
Mary. Mary, where did you...

1181
01:03:08,317 --> 01:03:10,217
Oh, Mary.

1182
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:16,119
Remember the night we broke some windows in this old house?

1183
01:03:17,593 --> 01:03:19,584
This is what I wished for.

1184
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,526
You're wonderful.

1185
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,439
You're wonderful.

1186
01:03:49,522 --> 01:03:53,515
- Martini, you rented a new house? - Rent?

1187
01:03:54,828 --> 01:03:57,262
- You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey? - What's that?

1188
01:03:57,363 --> 01:03:59,024
I own the house.

1189
01:03:59,299 --> 01:04:02,632
Me, Giuseppe Martini, I own my own house.

1190
01:04:02,735 --> 01:04:06,034
No more we live like a pigs in this Potter's Field.

1191
01:04:06,172 --> 01:04:09,232
- Mary, Mary! - Mary, come on, bring the baby.

1192
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:11,706
I feel like a queen.

1193
01:04:11,811 --> 01:04:14,871
- I'll take the kids in the car. - Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

1194
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:17,848
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.

1195
01:04:17,984 --> 01:04:20,111
Now, one at a time. Get right up on the seat there.

1196
01:04:21,688 --> 01:04:25,317
- Sit down, there. - Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.

1197
01:04:26,559 --> 01:04:28,754
- Goat, too. - Everybody!

1198
01:04:29,062 --> 01:04:30,393
All in!

1199
01:04:32,632 --> 01:04:34,497
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1200
01:04:37,203 --> 01:04:38,295
All in?

1201
01:04:57,323 --> 01:04:59,723
Mr. And Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1202
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:02,785
Good old George, he's always making a speech.

1203
01:05:03,863 --> 01:05:05,160
Hee-haw!

1204
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:08,993
- Sam Wainwright. - Oh, who cares.

1205
01:05:09,569 --> 01:05:12,697
Bread. That this house may never know hunger.

1206
01:05:13,473 --> 01:05:16,806
Salt. That life may always have flavor.

1207
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:20,679
And wine. That joy and prosperity may reign forever.

1208
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:22,509
Enter the Martini castle.

1209
01:05:24,384 --> 01:05:26,818
Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose.

1210
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,717
I'm just your little rent collector.

1211
01:05:28,821 --> 01:05:31,619
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park anymore.

1212
01:05:31,724 --> 01:05:32,816
Look at it.

1213
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:35,717
Congressman Black is here to see you, sir.

1214
01:05:35,828 --> 01:05:38,763
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait. Go on.

1215
01:05:38,898 --> 01:05:41,662
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen houses stuck here and there.

1216
01:05:41,768 --> 01:05:43,998
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies.

1217
01:05:44,103 --> 01:05:46,264
I used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1218
01:05:47,173 --> 01:05:48,470
Look at it today.

1219
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:51,439
Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw,

1220
01:05:51,644 --> 01:05:54,841
90% owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you.

1221
01:05:54,948 --> 01:05:58,247
Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1222
01:05:58,351 --> 01:06:01,787
And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1223
01:06:01,888 --> 01:06:03,617
Oh, they are, are they?

1224
01:06:03,723 --> 01:06:06,624
Even though they know the Baileys never made a dime out of it.

1225
01:06:06,726 --> 01:06:09,194
You know very well why. The Baileys were all chumps.

1226
01:06:09,295 --> 01:06:11,229
Every one of these homes is worth

1227
01:06:11,331 --> 01:06:13,424
twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build.

1228
01:06:13,533 --> 01:06:15,967
- Lf I were you, Mr. Potter... - You are not me.

1229
01:06:16,069 --> 01:06:19,527
As I say, it's no skin off my nose,

1230
01:06:22,675 --> 01:06:24,609
but one of these days this bright young man

1231
01:06:24,711 --> 01:06:27,305
is gonna be asking George Bailey for a job.

1232
01:06:29,749 --> 01:06:32,843
The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough.

1233
01:06:32,952 --> 01:06:35,011
- Yes, sir? - Come in here.

1234
01:06:35,388 --> 01:06:37,549
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory,

1235
01:06:37,657 --> 01:06:39,625
and then we're gonna drive on down to Florida.

1236
01:06:39,726 --> 01:06:41,353
Why don't you have your friends join us?

1237
01:06:41,461 --> 01:06:44,828
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?

1238
01:06:45,231 --> 01:06:47,995
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.

1239
01:06:48,101 --> 01:06:50,126
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?

1240
01:06:50,236 --> 01:06:53,797
Jane, I offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics,

1241
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:55,066
and he turned me down cold.

1242
01:06:55,174 --> 01:06:57,938
- Oh, now, don't rub it in. - I'm not rubbing it in.

1243
01:06:58,044 --> 01:06:59,636
Well, I guess we better run along.

1244
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,771
- Awfully happy to have met you, Mary. - Nice meeting you, too.

1245
01:07:01,881 --> 01:07:03,246
- Goodbye. Glad to see you. - Goodbye, George.

1246
01:07:03,349 --> 01:07:04,782
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.

1247
01:07:04,884 --> 01:07:06,943
- So long, Mary. - Bye, Sam. Have fun.

1248
01:07:07,053 --> 01:07:09,044
- Thanks for dropping around. - Florida!

1249
01:07:09,155 --> 01:07:10,816
- Hee-haw! - Hee-haw.

1250
01:07:40,153 --> 01:07:41,415
Thank you, sir.

1251
01:07:42,021 --> 01:07:43,989
- That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter. - You like it?

1252
01:07:44,090 --> 01:07:45,614
I'll send you a box.

1253
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,728
Well, I...

1254
01:07:57,336 --> 01:07:58,803
I suppose I'll find out sooner or later,

1255
01:07:58,905 --> 01:08:01,738
but just what exactly did you want to see me about?

1256
01:08:03,876 --> 01:08:07,437
George, now that's just what I like so much about you.

1257
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:11,609
George, I am an old man, and most people hate me.

1258
01:08:11,718 --> 01:08:14,687
But I don't like them, either, so that makes it all even.

1259
01:08:14,787 --> 01:08:16,948
You know just as well as I do

1260
01:08:17,056 --> 01:08:19,547
that I run practically everything in this town

1261
01:08:19,659 --> 01:08:22,219
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1262
01:08:22,729 --> 01:08:26,790
You know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of it.

1263
01:08:26,899 --> 01:08:29,493
Or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it.

1264
01:08:29,736 --> 01:08:31,670
You have been stopping me.

1265
01:08:32,805 --> 01:08:35,933
In fact, you have beaten me, George,

1266
01:08:36,042 --> 01:08:40,479
and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.

1267
01:08:41,614 --> 01:08:44,276
Take during the Depression, for instance.

1268
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:47,477
You and I were the only ones that kept our heads.

1269
01:08:47,587 --> 01:08:51,523
You saved the Building and Loan. I saved all the rest.

1270
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:54,252
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.

1271
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:57,625
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers.

1272
01:08:58,631 --> 01:09:02,658
Now, I have stated my side very frankly.

1273
01:09:03,069 --> 01:09:05,162
Now let's look at your side.

1274
01:09:06,139 --> 01:09:13,011
Young man, 27-28, married, making, say, $40 a week.

1275
01:09:13,179 --> 01:09:15,079
- $45. - $45.

1276
01:09:15,181 --> 01:09:16,273
$45.

1277
01:09:16,682 --> 01:09:20,550
Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills,

1278
01:09:20,653 --> 01:09:23,713
you're able to keep, say, $10, if you skimp.

1279
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:28,156
A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the $10.

1280
01:09:28,261 --> 01:09:33,756
Now, if this young man of 28 was a common, ordinary yokel,

1281
01:09:33,866 --> 01:09:35,424
I'd say he was doing fine.

1282
01:09:35,535 --> 01:09:39,801
But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.

1283
01:09:39,906 --> 01:09:43,569
He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man,

1284
01:09:43,676 --> 01:09:46,873
who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan

1285
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:48,606
almost as much as I do.

1286
01:09:49,348 --> 01:09:53,910
A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.

1287
01:09:54,353 --> 01:09:57,151
A young man... The smartest one of the crowd, mind you.

1288
01:09:57,256 --> 01:09:58,848
A young man who has to sit by

1289
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:02,394
and watch his friends go places because he's trapped.

1290
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:06,124
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away,

1291
01:10:06,232 --> 01:10:08,792
playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters.

1292
01:10:10,303 --> 01:10:13,568
Do I paint a correct picture, or do I exaggerate?

1293
01:10:16,075 --> 01:10:18,600
- Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter? - My point?

1294
01:10:18,711 --> 01:10:21,271
- My point is I want to hire you. - Hire me?

1295
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:24,611
Yeah, I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties.

1296
01:10:24,884 --> 01:10:29,947
George, I'll start you out at $20,000 a year.

1297
01:10:33,826 --> 01:10:36,727
$20,000 a year?

1298
01:10:36,863 --> 01:10:40,230
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town,

1299
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,995
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1300
01:10:43,102 --> 01:10:45,866
a couple of business trips to New York a year,

1301
01:10:45,972 --> 01:10:47,803
maybe once in a while Europe.

1302
01:10:47,907 --> 01:10:49,204
You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?

1303
01:10:49,308 --> 01:10:50,639
Would I?

1304
01:10:53,679 --> 01:10:55,977
You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you?

1305
01:10:56,082 --> 01:10:57,777
You know, this is me. You remember me?

1306
01:10:57,884 --> 01:10:59,647
- George Bailey. - George Bailey.

1307
01:10:59,752 --> 01:11:02,778
Yeah, George Bailey, whose ship has just come in.

1308
01:11:04,123 --> 01:11:07,320
Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.

1309
01:11:15,668 --> 01:11:17,067
Holy mackerel.

1310
01:11:20,172 --> 01:11:22,697
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1311
01:11:22,808 --> 01:11:26,209
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success?

1312
01:11:26,345 --> 01:11:31,248
I'm offering you a three-years contract at $20,000 a year, starting today.

1313
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:33,045
Is it a deal, or isn't it?

1314
01:11:34,720 --> 01:11:36,347
Well, Mr. Potter, I...

1315
01:11:36,589 --> 01:11:40,355
I know I ought to jump at the chance but I... I just...

1316
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:45,521
I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me 24 hours to think it over?

1317
01:11:45,631 --> 01:11:47,292
Sure, sure, sure.

1318
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:49,925
You go on home and talk about it to your wife.

1319
01:11:50,036 --> 01:11:51,560
I'd like to do that.

1320
01:11:51,671 --> 01:11:54,003
Yeah. In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.

1321
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:55,971
- All right, sir. - Okay, George?

1322
01:11:57,510 --> 01:11:59,000
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1323
01:12:07,219 --> 01:12:11,485
No. No. No, no, now wait a minute, here.

1324
01:12:12,391 --> 01:12:15,224
I don't need 24 hours. I don't have to talk to anybody.

1325
01:12:15,328 --> 01:12:19,025
I know right now, and the answer is no. No, doggone it!

1326
01:12:19,165 --> 01:12:21,599
You sit around here, and you spin your little webs,

1327
01:12:21,701 --> 01:12:24,169
and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.

1328
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,794
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1329
01:12:25,905 --> 01:12:29,068
In the whole vast configuration of things,

1330
01:12:29,175 --> 01:12:31,939
I'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.

1331
01:12:32,044 --> 01:12:33,011
You...

1332
01:12:34,513 --> 01:12:36,606
And that goes for you, too!

1333
01:12:40,720 --> 01:12:42,779
And it goes for you, too!

1334
01:12:49,795 --> 01:12:52,787
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town,

1335
01:12:53,265 --> 01:12:55,825
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1336
01:12:56,102 --> 01:12:59,594
going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a year,

1337
01:12:59,705 --> 01:13:01,900
maybe Europe once in a while.

1338
01:13:02,908 --> 01:13:05,001
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

1339
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:08,308
and the next day and next year and the year after that.

1340
01:13:08,414 --> 01:13:11,542
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet,

1341
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,447
and I'm gonna see the world.

1342
01:13:13,552 --> 01:13:16,282
And then I'm gonna build things. I'm gonna build air fields.

1343
01:13:16,389 --> 01:13:18,949
I'm gonna build skyscrapers 100 stories high.

1344
01:13:19,058 --> 01:13:21,424
I'm gonna build a bridge a mile long.

1345
01:13:22,728 --> 01:13:25,856
What is it you want, Mary? What, you want the moon?

1346
01:13:26,465 --> 01:13:28,899
If you do, just say the word, I'll throw a lasso around it

1347
01:13:29,001 --> 01:13:30,696
and pull her down for you.

1348
01:13:30,936 --> 01:13:33,427
Buffalo gal Won't you come out tonight?

1349
01:13:33,539 --> 01:13:36,406
Won't you come out tonight? Won't you come out tonight?

1350
01:13:36,509 --> 01:13:39,444
Buffalo gal Won't you come out tonight

1351
01:13:39,545 --> 01:13:41,206
And

1352
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,578
- Hi. - Hi.

1353
01:13:55,094 --> 01:13:56,356
Mary Hatch,

1354
01:13:58,898 --> 01:14:01,662
why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?

1355
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,296
To keep from being an old maid.

1356
01:14:05,805 --> 01:14:07,238
You could have married Sam Wainwright

1357
01:14:07,339 --> 01:14:09,034
and anybody else in town.

1358
01:14:09,442 --> 01:14:12,104
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town.

1359
01:14:13,212 --> 01:14:15,180
I want my baby to look like you.

1360
01:14:15,347 --> 01:14:17,338
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1361
01:14:17,450 --> 01:14:18,781
I promised you...

1362
01:14:19,652 --> 01:14:21,916
- Your what? - My baby.

1363
01:14:24,690 --> 01:14:26,180
Your... Your...

1364
01:14:27,093 --> 01:14:28,754
Mary, you on the nest?

1365
01:14:29,028 --> 01:14:32,930
- George Bailey lassoes stork. - Lassoes a stork!

1366
01:14:36,969 --> 01:14:40,871
You mean you... What is it, a boy or a girl?

1367
01:14:44,510 --> 01:14:49,004
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1368
01:14:49,115 --> 01:14:52,812
- No! - Mary had her baby, a boy.

1369
01:14:53,552 --> 01:14:55,611
Then she had another one, a girl.

1370
01:14:55,921 --> 01:14:57,912
Day after day she worked away,

1371
01:14:58,023 --> 01:15:00,924
remaking the old Granville house into a home.

1372
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,687
Night after night, George came back late from the office.

1373
01:15:08,467 --> 01:15:10,662
Potter was bearing down hard.

1374
01:15:15,908 --> 01:15:17,500
Then came a war.

1375
01:15:18,344 --> 01:15:21,905
Ma Bailey and Mrs. Hatch joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1376
01:15:22,381 --> 01:15:26,477
Mary had two more babies but still found time to run the USO.

1377
01:15:26,719 --> 01:15:30,246
Sam Wainwright made a fortune in plastic hoods for planes.

1378
01:15:30,556 --> 01:15:32,956
Potter became head of the draft board.

1379
01:15:33,392 --> 01:15:34,723
One-A.

1380
01:15:35,895 --> 01:15:37,123
One-A.

1381
01:15:40,032 --> 01:15:41,124
One-A.

1382
01:15:41,467 --> 01:15:43,935
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1383
01:15:44,336 --> 01:15:48,363
Bert the cop was wounded in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1384
01:15:48,941 --> 01:15:52,206
Ernie the taxi driver parachuted into France.

1385
01:15:52,611 --> 01:15:55,705
Marty helped capture the Remagen Bridge.

1386
01:15:56,148 --> 01:15:57,206
Harry...

1387
01:15:57,316 --> 01:15:59,580
Harry Bailey topped them all.

1388
01:15:59,985 --> 01:16:03,614
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 planes,

1389
01:16:03,722 --> 01:16:08,022
two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.

1390
01:16:09,695 --> 01:16:12,027
- Yes, but George. - George?

1391
01:16:12,298 --> 01:16:14,232
Four-F on account of his ear,

1392
01:16:14,333 --> 01:16:16,767
George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.

1393
01:16:17,336 --> 01:16:19,634
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

1394
01:16:19,738 --> 01:16:21,262
Don't you know there's a war on?

1395
01:16:21,373 --> 01:16:23,136
Air raid warden.

1396
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:33,350
Paper drives.

1397
01:16:33,452 --> 01:16:34,783
Scrap drives.

1398
01:16:34,887 --> 01:16:36,286
Rubber drives.

1399
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:41,018
Like everybody else on VE Day, he wept and prayed.

1400
01:16:41,994 --> 01:16:46,727
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

1401
01:16:46,832 --> 01:16:49,266
Joseph, now show him what happened today.

1402
01:16:49,368 --> 01:16:49,834
Yes, sir.

1403
01:16:50,636 --> 01:16:53,764
This morning, day before Christmas, about 10:00 a.m.

1404
01:16:53,872 --> 01:16:55,396
Bedford Falls time...

1405
01:16:55,507 --> 01:16:57,771
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

1406
01:17:03,315 --> 01:17:04,304
It's gonna snow again.

1407
01:17:04,416 --> 01:17:07,681
What do you mean, it's gonna snow? Look at the headlines. The President...

1408
01:17:07,786 --> 01:17:10,220
I know, I know, George. That's marvelous.

1409
01:17:10,322 --> 01:17:11,812
Commander Harry Bailey!

1410
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:14,415
Mr. Gower, look at this, the second page.

1411
01:17:14,526 --> 01:17:15,754
Now, look, this is for you.

1412
01:17:15,861 --> 01:17:17,294
- This is for you. That's for you. - Okay.

1413
01:17:17,396 --> 01:17:19,159
- Right, thanks. - See you again.

1414
01:17:20,899 --> 01:17:22,958
Be sure you spell the name right.

1415
01:17:34,146 --> 01:17:35,636
Extra! Read all about it!

1416
01:17:35,748 --> 01:17:38,182
George, George! It's Harry now on long-distance from Washington.

1417
01:17:38,284 --> 01:17:39,774
Harry! What do you know about that!

1418
01:17:39,885 --> 01:17:41,375
He reversed the charges. It's okay, isn't it?

1419
01:17:41,487 --> 01:17:43,751
Reversed the charges? Of course it is for a hero.

1420
01:17:43,856 --> 01:17:45,221
Harry!

1421
01:17:45,357 --> 01:17:49,384
You old seven times a son of a gun. Congratulations.

1422
01:17:49,595 --> 01:17:52,063
How's Mother standing it? She did?

1423
01:17:52,431 --> 01:17:53,659
What do you know?

1424
01:17:53,766 --> 01:17:55,427
Mother had lunch with the President's wife.

1425
01:17:55,534 --> 01:17:56,592
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1426
01:17:56,702 --> 01:17:58,829
- What did they have to eat? - What'd they have to eat?

1427
01:17:58,937 --> 01:17:59,926
Harry,

1428
01:18:00,039 --> 01:18:03,133
you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you.

1429
01:18:03,242 --> 01:18:04,300
Oh, they are?

1430
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:06,275
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home this afternoon.

1431
01:18:06,378 --> 01:18:07,470
In a plane?

1432
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:10,007
What? Uncle Billy?

1433
01:18:10,115 --> 01:18:12,447
- Has Uncle Billy come in yet? - He stopped at the bank first.

1434
01:18:12,551 --> 01:18:15,987
He's not here right now, Harry. But look, now, tell me about it.

1435
01:18:16,088 --> 01:18:17,112
- George. George, George. - What?

1436
01:18:17,222 --> 01:18:18,314
- That man is here again. - What man?

1437
01:18:18,424 --> 01:18:19,982
Bank examiner.

1438
01:18:21,093 --> 01:18:23,220
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, will you?

1439
01:18:23,329 --> 01:18:24,489
I'll be right back.

1440
01:18:24,596 --> 01:18:26,063
Well, Harry.

1441
01:18:26,165 --> 01:18:28,633
- Good morning, sir. - Carter, bank examiner.

1442
01:18:28,734 --> 01:18:30,861
- Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.

1443
01:18:30,969 --> 01:18:32,698
We're all excited around here.

1444
01:18:32,805 --> 01:18:34,830
My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1445
01:18:34,940 --> 01:18:37,704
- The President just decorated him. - Well, I guess they do those things.

1446
01:18:37,810 --> 01:18:40,608
- Well, I trust you had a good year. - Good year?

1447
01:18:40,846 --> 01:18:43,906
Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1448
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:45,810
Yeah, very funny.

1449
01:18:48,020 --> 01:18:50,784
Well, now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1450
01:18:50,889 --> 01:18:53,119
Although I shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse charges

1451
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:54,954
on personal long-distance calls.

1452
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,618
- George, shall we hang up? - No, no.

1453
01:18:56,729 --> 01:18:58,356
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy. You just hold on, there.

1454
01:18:58,464 --> 01:19:01,228
Now, if you'll cooperate, I'd like to finish with you by tonight.

1455
01:19:01,333 --> 01:19:04,166
I want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my family.

1456
01:19:04,269 --> 01:19:05,531
I don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1457
01:19:05,637 --> 01:19:06,899
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.

1458
01:19:07,973 --> 01:19:10,999
December 24.

1459
01:19:16,615 --> 01:19:19,175
$8,000.

1460
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:22,879
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter. - Merry Christmas.

1461
01:19:22,988 --> 01:19:26,389
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter. What's the news?

1462
01:19:26,492 --> 01:19:30,223
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal."

1463
01:19:30,329 --> 01:19:32,388
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.

1464
01:19:32,498 --> 01:19:36,059
You just can't keep those Baileys down, now can you, Mr. Potter?

1465
01:19:36,168 --> 01:19:38,568
How does slacker George feel about that?

1466
01:19:38,670 --> 01:19:39,898
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1467
01:19:40,005 --> 01:19:42,200
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

1468
01:19:42,307 --> 01:19:44,332
Of course, slacker George would've gotten

1469
01:19:44,443 --> 01:19:46,308
two of these medals if he had gone.

1470
01:19:46,412 --> 01:19:47,902
- Bad ear. - Yes.

1471
01:19:48,113 --> 01:19:51,549
After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home.

1472
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:55,643
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.

1473
01:20:02,995 --> 01:20:06,658
- Good morning, Mr. Bailey. - Good morning, Horace.

1474
01:20:07,766 --> 01:20:10,462
- I guess you forgot something. - Huh?

1475
01:20:10,569 --> 01:20:12,400
- You forgot something. - What?

1476
01:20:12,504 --> 01:20:13,994
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?

1477
01:20:14,106 --> 01:20:15,073
Oh, sure, sure I am.

1478
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:18,541
Well, then, it's usually customary to bring the money with you.

1479
01:20:19,144 --> 01:20:22,281
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1480
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:23,305
Oh, shucks, I knew I had.

1481
01:20:25,184 --> 01:20:27,243
How about that finger there?

1482
01:20:27,352 --> 01:20:28,410
Well, I...

1483
01:20:29,321 --> 01:20:30,481
Bailey.

1484
01:20:37,029 --> 01:20:39,395
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1485
01:20:41,533 --> 01:20:43,728
Come on, look sharp.

1486
01:21:01,453 --> 01:21:02,943
Take me back.

1487
01:21:12,798 --> 01:21:16,131
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter. I got those books for you here.

1488
01:21:16,235 --> 01:21:17,634
Oh, hello, Vi.

1489
01:21:17,736 --> 01:21:19,294
George, can I see you for a second?

1490
01:21:19,404 --> 01:21:22,237
Why, of course you can. Go on in the office there.

1491
01:21:22,441 --> 01:21:25,239
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. He's on the telephone.

1492
01:21:26,078 --> 01:21:28,842
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry. Long distance, Washington.

1493
01:21:28,947 --> 01:21:30,039
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1494
01:21:30,148 --> 01:21:31,877
You know, your nephew, remember? Harry.

1495
01:21:31,984 --> 01:21:33,212
- Here he is. - Hurry up.

1496
01:21:33,752 --> 01:21:37,483
Hello? Hello. Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

1497
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:40,184
I ought to have my head examined.

1498
01:21:40,292 --> 01:21:43,159
$8,000. It's got to be somewhere.

1499
01:21:49,368 --> 01:21:50,562
Here you are.

1500
01:21:51,169 --> 01:21:52,227
Character?

1501
01:21:52,905 --> 01:21:54,167
If I had any character, I'd...

1502
01:21:54,273 --> 01:21:57,674
It takes a lot of character to leave your hometown and start all over again.

1503
01:21:57,776 --> 01:21:59,243
No, George, don't.

1504
01:21:59,344 --> 01:22:01,335
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

1505
01:22:01,446 --> 01:22:03,038
- I know, but... - What do you want to do,

1506
01:22:03,148 --> 01:22:04,911
hock your furs and that hat?

1507
01:22:06,318 --> 01:22:07,785
You want to walk to New York?

1508
01:22:07,886 --> 01:22:09,649
You know, they charge for meals and rent up there,

1509
01:22:09,755 --> 01:22:11,154
just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.

1510
01:22:11,256 --> 01:22:13,019
- Yeah, sure. - No, that's a loan, now.

1511
01:22:13,325 --> 01:22:15,589
That's my business, Building and Loan.

1512
01:22:15,794 --> 01:22:18,820
Besides, you'll get a job. Good luck to you.

1513
01:22:18,931 --> 01:22:21,058
I'm glad I know you, George Bailey.

1514
01:22:26,305 --> 01:22:29,035
- Say hello to New York for me. - Yeah, yeah, sure, I will.

1515
01:22:29,141 --> 01:22:31,006
Now, let's hear from you once in a while.

1516
01:22:35,013 --> 01:22:38,278
- Merry Christmas, Vi. - Merry Christmas, George.

1517
01:22:39,217 --> 01:22:41,685
- Mr. Bailey. - Oh, Mr. Carter, I'm sorry.

1518
01:22:41,787 --> 01:22:43,254
I'll be right with you. Uncle Billy in there?

1519
01:22:43,355 --> 01:22:44,845
Yeah, he's in his office.

1520
01:22:44,957 --> 01:22:47,118
What's going on?

1521
01:22:47,359 --> 01:22:49,327
The bank examiner's here.

1522
01:22:50,162 --> 01:22:53,063
- He's here? - Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

1523
01:22:53,198 --> 01:22:54,756
What's the matter with you?

1524
01:22:54,866 --> 01:22:56,265
Come here.

1525
01:23:16,555 --> 01:23:17,522
Eustace.

1526
01:23:17,623 --> 01:23:19,318
- Yeah? - Come here a minute.

1527
01:23:21,093 --> 01:23:23,357
Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night?

1528
01:23:23,462 --> 01:23:25,896
He had it on his desk counting it before he closed up.

1529
01:23:27,099 --> 01:23:28,657
Now, look, did you buy anything?

1530
01:23:28,767 --> 01:23:31,065
- Nothing. Not even a stick of gum. - All right, all right.

1531
01:23:31,169 --> 01:23:33,763
Now, we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.

1532
01:23:33,872 --> 01:23:34,839
- Right. This way. - Come on.

1533
01:23:44,816 --> 01:23:46,784
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?

1534
01:23:46,885 --> 01:23:49,979
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1535
01:23:50,088 --> 01:23:52,886
Maybe! I don't want any maybe. We've got to find that money!

1536
01:23:52,991 --> 01:23:54,481
- I'm no good to you, George. - Uncle Billy, look,

1537
01:23:54,593 --> 01:23:57,153
do you realize what's going to happen if we don't find it?

1538
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:58,286
Listen to me.

1539
01:23:58,397 --> 01:24:00,160
Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house?

1540
01:24:00,265 --> 01:24:02,290
Someplace you would have... Someplace you hide the money?

1541
01:24:02,401 --> 01:24:03,993
I've gone over the whole house,

1542
01:24:04,102 --> 01:24:08,004
even in rooms that have been locked since I lost Laura.

1543
01:24:08,106 --> 01:24:11,200
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!

1544
01:24:11,309 --> 01:24:15,405
I can't think anymore, George. I can't think anymore. It hurts.

1545
01:24:15,514 --> 01:24:18,381
Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool?

1546
01:24:18,483 --> 01:24:21,213
Where's that money? Do you realize what this means?

1547
01:24:21,319 --> 01:24:24,288
It means bankruptcy and scandal and prison!

1548
01:24:25,457 --> 01:24:26,754
That's what it means.

1549
01:24:26,858 --> 01:24:30,055
One of us is going to jail. Well, it's not going to be me.

1550
01:24:52,851 --> 01:24:53,943
Hello, darling.

1551
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:55,815
- Hello, Daddy. - Hello, Daddy.

1552
01:24:55,921 --> 01:24:57,752
How do you like it?

1553
01:24:57,856 --> 01:24:59,517
- Bless you! - Bless you!

1554
01:25:01,293 --> 01:25:02,453
Did you bring the wreath?

1555
01:25:02,561 --> 01:25:04,358
Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?

1556
01:25:04,463 --> 01:25:05,452
What wreath?

1557
01:25:05,564 --> 01:25:07,998
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.

1558
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,397
No. I left it at the office.

1559
01:25:09,501 --> 01:25:11,469
- Is it snowing? - Yeah, it just started.

1560
01:25:11,570 --> 01:25:14,596
- Where's your coat and hat? - Left them at the office.

1561
01:25:14,806 --> 01:25:15,864
What's the matter?

1562
01:25:15,974 --> 01:25:18,499
Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.

1563
01:25:26,218 --> 01:25:29,517
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy. You can help me get this star up.

1564
01:25:29,621 --> 01:25:32,590
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

1565
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:36,991
All right, fill in that little bare spot right there. Right there.

1566
01:25:39,264 --> 01:25:42,722
Isn't it wonderful about Harry? We're famous, George.

1567
01:25:42,834 --> 01:25:46,565
Bet I had 50 calls today about the parade, the banquet.

1568
01:25:46,738 --> 01:25:48,797
Your mother's so excited. She...

1569
01:26:09,461 --> 01:26:11,929
Must she keep playing that?

1570
01:26:12,030 --> 01:26:14,828
I have to practice it for the party tonight, Daddy.

1571
01:26:14,933 --> 01:26:17,993
Mama said we could stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1572
01:26:18,103 --> 01:26:19,570
Can you sing, Daddy?

1573
01:26:20,005 --> 01:26:21,563
Better hurry and shave.

1574
01:26:21,673 --> 01:26:24,608
- The families will be here soon. - Families.

1575
01:26:24,709 --> 01:26:27,143
I don't want the families over here.

1576
01:26:28,947 --> 01:26:31,973
Come on out in the kitchen with me while I finish dinner.

1577
01:26:32,083 --> 01:26:35,143
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1578
01:26:35,287 --> 01:26:37,414
- Have a hectic day? - Oh, yeah.

1579
01:26:37,522 --> 01:26:40,389
Another big red-letter day for the Baileys.

1580
01:26:40,892 --> 01:26:43,725
Daddy, the Browns next door have a new car. You should see it.

1581
01:26:43,829 --> 01:26:46,297
Well, what's the matter with our car? Isn't it good enough for you?

1582
01:26:46,398 --> 01:26:47,365
Yes, Daddy.

1583
01:26:47,465 --> 01:26:49,899
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1584
01:26:50,001 --> 01:26:52,196
- Excuse you for what? - I burped.

1585
01:26:53,338 --> 01:26:54,703
All right, darling, you're excused.

1586
01:26:54,806 --> 01:26:57,536
Now, go on upstairs and see if little Zuzu wants anything.

1587
01:26:58,109 --> 01:27:02,409
- Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu? - Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.

1588
01:27:02,514 --> 01:27:03,947
Caught it coming home from school.

1589
01:27:04,049 --> 01:27:06,574
They gave her a flower for a prize, and she didn't want to crush it,

1590
01:27:06,685 --> 01:27:07,879
so she didn't button up her coat.

1591
01:27:07,986 --> 01:27:10,147
- What is it, a sore throat or what? - It's just a cold.

1592
01:27:10,255 --> 01:27:11,517
- The doctor says it's nothing serious. - The doctor?

1593
01:27:11,623 --> 01:27:13,352
- Was the doctor here? - Yes, I called him right away.

1594
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:14,686
He says it's nothing to worry about.

1595
01:27:14,793 --> 01:27:16,055
Is she running a temperature? What is it?

1596
01:27:16,161 --> 01:27:18,220
Just a teensy one, 99.6. She'll be all right.

1597
01:27:18,330 --> 01:27:19,797
Of course, it's this old house.

1598
01:27:19,898 --> 01:27:22,093
I don't know why we don't all have pneumonia.

1599
01:27:22,200 --> 01:27:26,466
Drafty old barn. Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

1600
01:27:26,738 --> 01:27:28,467
Why did we have to live here in the first place

1601
01:27:28,573 --> 01:27:31,667
and stay around this measly, crummy old town?

1602
01:27:32,477 --> 01:27:35,037
- George, what's wrong? - Wrong! Everything's wrong.

1603
01:27:35,146 --> 01:27:38,411
You call this a happy family? Why do we have to have all these kids?

1604
01:27:38,516 --> 01:27:42,179
- Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"? - I don't know. Ask your mother.

1605
01:27:42,287 --> 01:27:44,016
- Where're you going? - I'm going up to see Zuzu.

1606
01:27:44,122 --> 01:27:46,488
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1607
01:27:57,369 --> 01:28:01,100
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1608
01:28:01,339 --> 01:28:02,670
Hi, Daddy!

1609
01:28:03,842 --> 01:28:07,005
- Well, what happened to you? - I won a flower.

1610
01:28:07,345 --> 01:28:09,176
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?

1611
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:10,908
I want to give my flower a drink.

1612
01:28:11,016 --> 01:28:13,211
All right, all right. Now, give Daddy the flower.

1613
01:28:13,318 --> 01:28:14,615
I'll give it a drink.

1614
01:28:14,719 --> 01:28:16,016
Now, here.

1615
01:28:17,555 --> 01:28:19,648
Look, Daddy!

1616
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:21,156
Paste it!

1617
01:28:21,259 --> 01:28:23,750
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.

1618
01:28:26,231 --> 01:28:28,756
Now, we'll paste this together here.

1619
01:28:32,003 --> 01:28:35,131
There. There it is. Good as new.

1620
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,333
Now, give the flower a drink.

1621
01:28:37,442 --> 01:28:38,875
Now, will you do something for me?

1622
01:28:38,977 --> 01:28:41,673
- What? - Will you try to get some sleep?

1623
01:28:41,913 --> 01:28:44,814
I'm not sleepy. I want to look at my flower.

1624
01:28:44,916 --> 01:28:49,319
I know, I know, but you just go to sleep and then you can dream about it,

1625
01:28:49,654 --> 01:28:51,781
and it'll be a whole garden.

1626
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:53,118
It will?

1627
01:29:01,566 --> 01:29:03,329
- Telephone! - Telephone!

1628
01:29:03,435 --> 01:29:04,834
I'll get it.

1629
01:29:06,771 --> 01:29:07,931
Hello?

1630
01:29:08,873 --> 01:29:10,864
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1631
01:29:11,276 --> 01:29:14,143
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. I'm sure she'll be all right.

1632
01:29:14,245 --> 01:29:15,837
The doctor said that she ought to be out of bed

1633
01:29:15,947 --> 01:29:17,141
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1634
01:29:17,248 --> 01:29:18,772
- Is that Zuzu's teacher? - Yes.

1635
01:29:18,883 --> 01:29:20,214
Let me speak to her.

1636
01:29:20,318 --> 01:29:22,718
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1637
01:29:23,054 --> 01:29:25,579
This is George Bailey. I'm Zuzu's father.

1638
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:27,385
Say, what kind of a teacher are you, anyway?

1639
01:29:27,492 --> 01:29:29,756
What do you mean sending her home like that, half naked?

1640
01:29:29,861 --> 01:29:32,386
Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?

1641
01:29:32,497 --> 01:29:34,431
- George! - Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for

1642
01:29:34,532 --> 01:29:36,625
to have teachers like you?

1643
01:29:36,735 --> 01:29:39,966
Stupid, silly, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on?

1644
01:29:40,071 --> 01:29:41,902
You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids.

1645
01:29:42,007 --> 01:29:43,702
And maybe they don't have any decent clothes...

1646
01:29:43,808 --> 01:29:45,571
That stupid...

1647
01:29:46,344 --> 01:29:49,211
Hello, Mrs. Welch. I want to apologize...

1648
01:29:49,314 --> 01:29:51,407
Hello? Hello.

1649
01:29:53,218 --> 01:29:55,618
- She's hung up! - I'll hang her up!

1650
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:58,883
- Hey, you! I'll knock your block off! - What is that?

1651
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,787
Hello! Who's this?

1652
01:30:00,892 --> 01:30:02,382
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1653
01:30:02,794 --> 01:30:04,261
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1654
01:30:04,362 --> 01:30:06,387
Give me a chance to tell you what I really think of your wife.

1655
01:30:06,498 --> 01:30:07,522
George, stop it.

1656
01:30:07,632 --> 01:30:09,327
Will you get out and let me handle this?

1657
01:30:09,434 --> 01:30:11,925
Hello? Hello? What?

1658
01:30:13,705 --> 01:30:15,229
Oh, you will, huh?

1659
01:30:15,340 --> 01:30:18,241
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time you think you're man enough, you...

1660
01:30:18,343 --> 01:30:19,833
Hello! Any...

1661
01:30:24,115 --> 01:30:25,013
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

1662
01:30:25,116 --> 01:30:27,107
How should I know? What do you think I am, a dictionary?

1663
01:30:27,218 --> 01:30:28,446
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1664
01:30:28,553 --> 01:30:30,384
Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet?

1665
01:30:30,488 --> 01:30:34,185
You play it over and over again. Now stop it! Stop it!

1666
01:31:01,319 --> 01:31:02,911
I'm sorry, Mary.

1667
01:31:06,224 --> 01:31:08,089
Janie, I'm sorry.

1668
01:31:08,793 --> 01:31:12,923
I didn't mean that. I... You go on and practice.

1669
01:31:18,503 --> 01:31:20,835
Pete, I owe you an apology, too.

1670
01:31:22,140 --> 01:31:23,471
I'm sorry.

1671
01:31:24,909 --> 01:31:27,742
- What do you want to know? - Nothing, Daddy.

1672
01:31:34,719 --> 01:31:36,482
What's the matter with everybody?

1673
01:31:36,588 --> 01:31:39,113
Janie, go on. I told you to practice. Now, go on, play!

1674
01:31:39,224 --> 01:31:40,521
Oh, Daddy!

1675
01:31:45,964 --> 01:31:49,365
George, why must you torture the children? Why don't you...

1676
01:31:50,168 --> 01:31:51,362
Mary...

1677
01:32:05,483 --> 01:32:07,383
Bedford 247, please.

1678
01:32:07,485 --> 01:32:09,476
- Is Daddy in trouble? - Yes, Pete.

1679
01:32:09,587 --> 01:32:12,647
- Shall I pray for him? - Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1680
01:32:12,757 --> 01:32:14,748
- Me, too? - You, too, Tommy.

1681
01:32:15,827 --> 01:32:17,727
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1682
01:32:18,329 --> 01:32:19,125
I'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1683
01:32:20,632 --> 01:32:21,963
I need help.

1684
01:32:23,134 --> 01:32:26,001
Through some sort of an accident, my company's short in their accounts.

1685
01:32:26,104 --> 01:32:27,901
The bank examiner got there today.

1686
01:32:28,006 --> 01:32:30,201
I've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

1687
01:32:30,308 --> 01:32:32,776
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?

1688
01:32:32,877 --> 01:32:34,174
- The reporters? - Yes.

1689
01:32:34,279 --> 01:32:37,646
They called me up from your Building and Loan.

1690
01:32:37,949 --> 01:32:41,316
Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too.

1691
01:32:41,419 --> 01:32:42,613
He's looking for you.

1692
01:32:42,720 --> 01:32:46,315
Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you, please?

1693
01:32:46,424 --> 01:32:48,255
Can't you see what it means to my family?

1694
01:32:48,359 --> 01:32:51,157
I'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest,

1695
01:32:51,262 --> 01:32:52,820
if you still want the Building and Loan...

1696
01:32:52,931 --> 01:32:56,423
George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?

1697
01:32:56,534 --> 01:32:58,024
No, sir. There's nothing wrong with the books.

1698
01:32:58,136 --> 01:33:01,128
I've just misplaced $8,000. I can't find it anywhere.

1699
01:33:01,239 --> 01:33:05,175
- You misplaced $8,000? - Yes, sir.

1700
01:33:08,346 --> 01:33:11,873
- Have you notified the police? - No, sir. I didn't want the publicity.

1701
01:33:11,983 --> 01:33:16,044
- Harry's homecoming tomorrow... - They're going to believe that one.

1702
01:33:16,154 --> 01:33:18,418
What've you been doing, George?

1703
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:20,218
Playing the market with the company's money?

1704
01:33:20,325 --> 01:33:21,451
No, sir. No, sir, I haven't.

1705
01:33:21,559 --> 01:33:23,527
Is it a woman, then?

1706
01:33:23,628 --> 01:33:27,189
You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1707
01:33:27,298 --> 01:33:28,322
What?

1708
01:33:28,433 --> 01:33:31,129
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me?

1709
01:33:31,236 --> 01:33:33,932
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?

1710
01:33:34,038 --> 01:33:35,630
I can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.

1711
01:33:35,740 --> 01:33:37,139
Well, what about all your other friends?

1712
01:33:37,242 --> 01:33:39,540
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that.

1713
01:33:39,644 --> 01:33:41,509
You're the only one in town that can help me.

1714
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:46,045
I've suddenly become quite important.

1715
01:33:46,918 --> 01:33:49,546
What kind of security would I have, George?

1716
01:33:49,654 --> 01:33:52,953
- Have you got any stocks? - No, sir.

1717
01:33:53,057 --> 01:33:55,855
Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any kind?

1718
01:33:56,427 --> 01:34:00,591
I have some life insurance, a $15,000 policy.

1719
01:34:00,698 --> 01:34:04,361
- Yes. How much is your equity in it? - Five hundred dollars.

1720
01:34:04,569 --> 01:34:06,366
Five hundred dollars?

1721
01:34:06,838 --> 01:34:09,432
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

1722
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:14,102
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

1723
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:17,505
You were going to go out and conquer the world.

1724
01:34:18,116 --> 01:34:22,849
You once called me a warped, frustrated old man.

1725
01:34:23,588 --> 01:34:26,921
What are you but a warped, frustrated young man?

1726
01:34:27,525 --> 01:34:29,083
A miserable little clerk,

1727
01:34:29,193 --> 01:34:30,854
crawling in here on your hands and knees

1728
01:34:30,962 --> 01:34:32,793
and begging for help.

1729
01:34:33,031 --> 01:34:34,931
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

1730
01:34:35,033 --> 01:34:38,662
Nothing but a miserable little $500 equity

1731
01:34:38,770 --> 01:34:40,931
in a life insurance policy.

1732
01:34:41,773 --> 01:34:44,173
You're worth more dead than alive.

1733
01:34:44,676 --> 01:34:47,645
Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much

1734
01:34:47,745 --> 01:34:50,236
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

1735
01:34:50,715 --> 01:34:51,909
You know why?

1736
01:34:52,016 --> 01:34:54,712
Because they'd run you out of town on a rail.

1737
01:34:54,819 --> 01:34:57,982
But I tell you what I'm going to do for you, George.

1738
01:34:58,089 --> 01:35:01,252
Since the state examiner is still here,

1739
01:35:01,359 --> 01:35:03,884
as a stockholder of the Building and Loan,

1740
01:35:03,995 --> 01:35:06,896
I'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest.

1741
01:35:07,298 --> 01:35:11,325
Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance.

1742
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:15,336
All right, George, go ahead.

1743
01:35:15,440 --> 01:35:18,273
You can't hide in a little town like this.

1744
01:35:18,576 --> 01:35:20,737
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

1745
01:35:34,559 --> 01:35:37,790
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

1746
01:35:38,396 --> 01:35:40,023
How about some of that good spaghetti?

1747
01:35:40,131 --> 01:35:41,792
We got everything.

1748
01:35:52,944 --> 01:35:54,172
Oh, God.

1749
01:35:57,515 --> 01:35:58,743
Oh, God.

1750
01:36:03,821 --> 01:36:05,652
Dear Father in Heaven,

1751
01:36:08,893 --> 01:36:10,793
I'm not a praying man,

1752
01:36:11,996 --> 01:36:14,897
but if you're up there and you can hear me,

1753
01:36:16,567 --> 01:36:18,125
show me the way.

1754
01:36:18,636 --> 01:36:20,934
I'm at the end of my rope. I...

1755
01:36:22,874 --> 01:36:24,842
Show me the way, O God.

1756
01:36:29,747 --> 01:36:32,950
Are you all right, George? Want somebody to take you home?

1757
01:36:32,950 --> 01:36:33,382
Are you all right, George? Want somebody to take you home?

1758
01:36:36,120 --> 01:36:38,452
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1759
01:36:38,556 --> 01:36:41,923
Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve.

1760
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,928
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1761
01:36:45,563 --> 01:36:47,588
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1762
01:36:51,836 --> 01:36:54,669
The next time you talk to my wife like that, you'll get worse!

1763
01:36:54,772 --> 01:36:56,103
She cried for an hour!

1764
01:36:56,207 --> 01:36:59,335
It isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write,

1765
01:36:59,444 --> 01:37:01,969
- and you have to bawl her out. - You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1766
01:37:02,079 --> 01:37:03,546
Now, wait, I want to pay for my drink.

1767
01:37:03,648 --> 01:37:05,275
Never mind the money! You get out of here quick!

1768
01:37:05,383 --> 01:37:08,318
- All right! - You hit my best friend! Get out!

1769
01:37:13,691 --> 01:37:16,285
- You all right, George? - Who was that?

1770
01:37:16,727 --> 01:37:19,787
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

1771
01:37:19,897 --> 01:37:22,661
- He no come into my place no more. - Oh, Welch.

1772
01:37:22,767 --> 01:37:24,667
That's what I get for praying.

1773
01:37:24,769 --> 01:37:26,794
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?

1774
01:37:26,904 --> 01:37:27,996
Yes, you bet.

1775
01:37:28,105 --> 01:37:31,506
Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here it is.

1776
01:37:31,609 --> 01:37:33,304
Oh, no, please, don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

1777
01:37:33,411 --> 01:37:35,038
- I'm all right. - No, no, you no feel so good.

1778
01:37:35,146 --> 01:37:36,511
- Sit down and rest. - I'm all right.

1779
01:37:36,614 --> 01:37:38,673
Please no go away, please!

1780
01:37:57,201 --> 01:37:59,499
What do you think you're doing?

1781
01:38:01,606 --> 01:38:05,440
Now look what you did. My great-grandfather planted this tree!

1782
01:38:06,377 --> 01:38:08,345
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1783
01:38:09,113 --> 01:38:12,810
Come back here, you drunken fool! Get this car out of here!

1784
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:24,352
Hey, what's the matter with you? Look where you're going.

1785
01:39:11,208 --> 01:39:12,300
Help!

1786
01:39:13,911 --> 01:39:16,573
Help! Help!

1787
01:39:20,117 --> 01:39:21,914
Help! Help!

1788
01:39:24,555 --> 01:39:26,147
Help!

1789
01:39:29,093 --> 01:39:32,995
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1790
01:39:39,203 --> 01:39:40,504
Help! Help!

1791
01:39:40,504 --> 01:39:41,402
Help! Help!

1792
01:39:58,222 --> 01:40:00,520
I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear.

1793
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:03,355
Wife gave me this on my last birthday.

1794
01:40:04,061 --> 01:40:05,790
I passed away in it.

1795
01:40:09,400 --> 01:40:12,267
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1796
01:40:15,473 --> 01:40:18,874
You should read the new book Mark Twain's writing now.

1797
01:40:19,577 --> 01:40:21,442
How did you happen to fall in?

1798
01:40:21,545 --> 01:40:24,673
I didn't fall in. I jumped in to save George.

1799
01:40:25,016 --> 01:40:27,883
You what? To save me?

1800
01:40:28,152 --> 01:40:31,212
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?

1801
01:40:31,322 --> 01:40:33,415
- Go through with what? - Suicide.

1802
01:40:33,524 --> 01:40:36,584
It's against the law to commit suicide around here.

1803
01:40:36,694 --> 01:40:39,492
Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.

1804
01:40:39,597 --> 01:40:41,929
- Where do you come from? - Heaven.

1805
01:40:47,104 --> 01:40:50,096
I had to act quickly. That's why I jumped in.

1806
01:40:50,207 --> 01:40:52,607
I knew if I were drowning, you'd try to save me.

1807
01:40:52,710 --> 01:40:55,611
You see, you did, and that's how I saved you.

1808
01:40:56,380 --> 01:40:57,745
Very funny.

1809
01:40:58,015 --> 01:41:00,040
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1810
01:41:00,151 --> 01:41:04,247
Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1811
01:41:04,355 --> 01:41:08,155
Oh, no, no, no, George, I'm the answer to your prayer.

1812
01:41:08,259 --> 01:41:10,557
That's why I was sent down here.

1813
01:41:11,162 --> 01:41:14,325
- How'd you know my name? - Oh, I know all about you.

1814
01:41:14,432 --> 01:41:16,229
I've watched you grow up from a little boy.

1815
01:41:16,333 --> 01:41:17,766
What are you, a mind reader or something?

1816
01:41:17,868 --> 01:41:18,960
No.

1817
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:22,972
- Well, who are you then? - Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

1818
01:41:23,708 --> 01:41:24,970
Oddbody?

1819
01:41:26,077 --> 01:41:28,170
AS2? What's that, AS2?

1820
01:41:28,446 --> 01:41:30,141
Angel Second Class.

1821
01:41:40,591 --> 01:41:42,354
Cheerio, my good man.

1822
01:41:46,530 --> 01:41:47,929
Oh, brother.

1823
01:41:50,267 --> 01:41:51,495
Gee whiz.

1824
01:41:52,570 --> 01:41:55,334
I wonder what Martini put in those drinks.

1825
01:41:57,441 --> 01:42:01,935
Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago?

1826
01:42:02,279 --> 01:42:03,871
Why'd you want to save me?

1827
01:42:03,981 --> 01:42:07,542
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.

1828
01:42:07,985 --> 01:42:10,078
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1829
01:42:10,187 --> 01:42:14,521
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

1830
01:42:14,625 --> 01:42:17,651
Yeah, now, just things like that... How do you know that?

1831
01:42:17,762 --> 01:42:21,755
I told you. I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.

1832
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:25,894
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get.

1833
01:42:26,003 --> 01:42:28,938
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?

1834
01:42:29,039 --> 01:42:33,032
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an Angel Second Class.

1835
01:42:37,381 --> 01:42:38,905
I don't know whether I'd like it very much

1836
01:42:39,016 --> 01:42:40,950
being seen around with an angel without any wings.

1837
01:42:41,051 --> 01:42:44,646
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?

1838
01:42:44,755 --> 01:42:46,120
Sure, sure.

1839
01:42:46,657 --> 01:42:49,251
- How? - By letting me help you.

1840
01:42:49,493 --> 01:42:52,257
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

1841
01:42:52,363 --> 01:42:54,297
You don't happen to have 8,000 bucks on you, do you?

1842
01:42:54,398 --> 01:42:56,832
Oh, no. No. We don't use money in heaven.

1843
01:42:56,934 --> 01:42:59,459
Oh, yeah, that's right, I keep forgetting.

1844
01:43:00,204 --> 01:43:03,799
- Comes in pretty handy down here, bub. - Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1845
01:43:04,875 --> 01:43:07,070
I found it out a little late.

1846
01:43:07,511 --> 01:43:09,536
I'm worth more dead than alive.

1847
01:43:09,647 --> 01:43:13,777
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude.

1848
01:43:13,884 --> 01:43:17,581
You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you...

1849
01:43:17,688 --> 01:43:20,350
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off.

1850
01:43:20,457 --> 01:43:22,652
My wife and my kids and my friends.

1851
01:43:22,760 --> 01:43:25,991
I mean, look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?

1852
01:43:26,096 --> 01:43:28,724
No, now, you don't understand. I've got my job...

1853
01:43:28,833 --> 01:43:30,664
Oh, shut up, will you?

1854
01:43:34,572 --> 01:43:37,234
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1855
01:43:42,580 --> 01:43:47,017
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1856
01:43:48,485 --> 01:43:51,249
Well, I don't know. I guess you're right.

1857
01:43:52,590 --> 01:43:55,457
I suppose it would have been better if I'd never been born at all.

1858
01:43:55,559 --> 01:43:58,858
- What'd you say? - I said I wish I'd never been born.

1859
01:43:58,963 --> 01:44:01,557
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1860
01:44:02,032 --> 01:44:06,594
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.

1861
01:44:07,605 --> 01:44:09,232
What do you think?

1862
01:44:09,907 --> 01:44:11,636
Yeah, that'll do it.

1863
01:44:12,343 --> 01:44:13,640
All right.

1864
01:44:16,380 --> 01:44:19,577
You've got your wish. You've never been born.

1865
01:44:25,189 --> 01:44:28,181
You don't have to make all that fuss about it!

1866
01:44:29,126 --> 01:44:30,525
What did you say?

1867
01:44:30,628 --> 01:44:34,462
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.

1868
01:44:34,565 --> 01:44:37,830
No worries, no obligations, no $8,000 to get,

1869
01:44:37,935 --> 01:44:39,766
no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff.

1870
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:43,306
- Say something else in that ear. - Sure, you can hear out of it.

1871
01:44:43,407 --> 01:44:45,534
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1872
01:44:45,643 --> 01:44:48,168
I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid.

1873
01:44:48,279 --> 01:44:50,406
Must have been that jump in that cold water.

1874
01:44:50,514 --> 01:44:53,210
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.

1875
01:44:57,955 --> 01:45:01,618
What do you know about that? What's happening?

1876
01:45:03,127 --> 01:45:05,391
It stopped snowing out here, didn't it?

1877
01:45:05,496 --> 01:45:07,259
What's happened here?

1878
01:45:07,998 --> 01:45:09,898
What I need is a couple of good stiff drinks.

1879
01:45:10,000 --> 01:45:12,264
How about you, Angel? You want a drink?

1880
01:45:13,771 --> 01:45:16,035
Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...

1881
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:18,074
The clothes are dry.

1882
01:45:18,175 --> 01:45:21,303
What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than I thought.

1883
01:45:21,412 --> 01:45:25,508
Now, come on, get your clothes on. We'll stroll up to my car and get...

1884
01:45:25,616 --> 01:45:27,777
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll stroll. You fly.

1885
01:45:27,885 --> 01:45:29,409
I can't fly. I haven't got my wings.

1886
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:32,182
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.

1887
01:45:37,861 --> 01:45:39,192
What's the matter?

1888
01:45:39,296 --> 01:45:41,992
Well, this is where I left my car, and it isn't here.

1889
01:45:42,099 --> 01:45:45,398
- You have no car. - Well, I had a car, and it was right here.

1890
01:45:45,502 --> 01:45:46,992
I guess somebody moved it.

1891
01:45:47,104 --> 01:45:51,165
- Good evening. - Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

1892
01:45:51,442 --> 01:45:53,535
- I beg your pardon? - My car, my car.

1893
01:45:53,644 --> 01:45:55,908
I'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.

1894
01:45:56,013 --> 01:45:58,004
- What tree? - What do you mean, what tree?

1895
01:45:58,115 --> 01:46:00,174
This tree. Here, I ran into it.

1896
01:46:00,284 --> 01:46:03,481
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

1897
01:46:07,825 --> 01:46:11,283
You must mean two other trees. You had me worried.

1898
01:46:11,395 --> 01:46:13,590
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

1899
01:46:13,697 --> 01:46:14,823
Pottersville?

1900
01:46:14,932 --> 01:46:16,524
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1901
01:46:16,633 --> 01:46:20,160
I mean Pottersville. Don't you think I know where I live?

1902
01:46:20,371 --> 01:46:22,430
What's the matter with you?

1903
01:46:22,539 --> 01:46:25,702
What's the matter with me? Well, I guess I just...

1904
01:46:28,312 --> 01:46:32,578
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut or he is or you are.

1905
01:46:33,617 --> 01:46:34,948
It isn't me.

1906
01:46:35,052 --> 01:46:37,043
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's.

1907
01:46:37,154 --> 01:46:39,486
- Well, come on, Gabriel. - Clarence.

1908
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:41,319
Clarence. Clarence.

1909
01:46:46,830 --> 01:46:50,630
That's all right. Go on in. Martini is a friend of mine.

1910
01:46:51,035 --> 01:46:53,663
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

1911
01:47:00,044 --> 01:47:03,571
- Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini? - Want a martini?

1912
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:05,705
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?

1913
01:47:05,816 --> 01:47:08,216
Hey, look, I'm the boss. You want a drink or don't you?

1914
01:47:08,318 --> 01:47:10,513
Okay, all right. Double bourbon, will you, and quick, huh?

1915
01:47:10,621 --> 01:47:11,815
Okay.

1916
01:47:14,992 --> 01:47:18,018
- What's yours? - I was just thinking.

1917
01:47:19,263 --> 01:47:21,663
It's been so long since I...

1918
01:47:21,765 --> 01:47:25,394
Look, mister, I'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.

1919
01:47:25,502 --> 01:47:27,094
That's a good man.

1920
01:47:27,204 --> 01:47:29,331
I was just thinking

1921
01:47:30,240 --> 01:47:33,368
of a flaming rum punch.

1922
01:47:33,777 --> 01:47:36,268
No, it's not cold enough for that, not nearly cold enough.

1923
01:47:36,380 --> 01:47:39,315
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I got it.

1924
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:43,011
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves.

1925
01:47:43,120 --> 01:47:45,020
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1926
01:47:45,122 --> 01:47:48,114
Hey, look, mister, we serve hard drinks in here

1927
01:47:48,225 --> 01:47:49,988
for men who want to get drunk fast.

1928
01:47:50,094 --> 01:47:53,621
And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere.

1929
01:47:53,730 --> 01:47:57,325
Is that clear, or do I have to slip you my left for a convincer?

1930
01:47:57,434 --> 01:47:58,799
What's he talking about?

1931
01:47:58,902 --> 01:48:02,770
Nick, Nick, just give him the same as mine.

1932
01:48:02,873 --> 01:48:05,171
- He's okay. - Okay.

1933
01:48:06,643 --> 01:48:10,204
What's the matter with him? I never saw Nick act like that before.

1934
01:48:10,314 --> 01:48:13,374
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.

1935
01:48:13,684 --> 01:48:15,413
Oh, yeah.

1936
01:48:18,655 --> 01:48:22,250
Hey, little fellow, you worry me, you know.

1937
01:48:22,359 --> 01:48:25,294
- You got someplace to sleep? - No.

1938
01:48:25,395 --> 01:48:26,919
You don't, huh?

1939
01:48:27,030 --> 01:48:29,624
- Well, you got any money? - No.

1940
01:48:30,601 --> 01:48:32,228
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1941
01:48:32,336 --> 01:48:35,931
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.

1942
01:48:39,843 --> 01:48:41,936
- Somebody's just made it. - Made what?

1943
01:48:42,045 --> 01:48:46,812
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.

1944
01:48:54,725 --> 01:48:57,455
Look, I think maybe you better not mention

1945
01:48:57,561 --> 01:48:58,892
getting your wings around here.

1946
01:48:58,996 --> 01:49:01,396
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1947
01:49:04,001 --> 01:49:05,832
Yeah, they believe in them.

1948
01:49:05,936 --> 01:49:09,201
Oh, why should they be surprised when they see one?

1949
01:49:11,041 --> 01:49:14,238
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

1950
01:49:14,678 --> 01:49:18,671
- How old are you anyway, Clarence? - Two hundred and ninety-three,

1951
01:49:20,918 --> 01:49:22,146
next May.

1952
01:49:22,786 --> 01:49:25,380
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

1953
01:49:25,489 --> 01:49:27,457
Go through the door or out the window.

1954
01:49:27,558 --> 01:49:29,583
- Look, Nick, what's wrong? - Now, that's another thing.

1955
01:49:29,693 --> 01:49:31,661
Where do you come off calling me Nick?

1956
01:49:31,762 --> 01:49:33,229
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1957
01:49:33,330 --> 01:49:37,460
What's that got to do with it? I don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1958
01:49:37,568 --> 01:49:40,401
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there. Come here, come here.

1959
01:49:43,907 --> 01:49:47,434
Didn't I tell you never to come panhandling around here, huh?

1960
01:49:54,551 --> 01:49:55,882
Mr. Gower.

1961
01:49:57,154 --> 01:49:58,451
Mr. Gower.

1962
01:50:00,123 --> 01:50:01,818
What... What did...

1963
01:50:02,226 --> 01:50:04,626
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.

1964
01:50:06,029 --> 01:50:08,122
- Don't you know me? - No.

1965
01:50:09,766 --> 01:50:10,926
No.

1966
01:50:11,034 --> 01:50:12,467
Throw him out. Throw him out.

1967
01:50:12,569 --> 01:50:14,560
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

1968
01:50:15,739 --> 01:50:18,003
Hey, Nick. Nick. Isn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1969
01:50:18,108 --> 01:50:20,303
You know, that's another reason for me not to like you.

1970
01:50:20,410 --> 01:50:23,846
That rum head spent 20 years in jail for poisoning a kid.

1971
01:50:23,947 --> 01:50:26,780
If you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself.

1972
01:50:26,883 --> 01:50:28,908
Would you show these gentlemen to the door?

1973
01:50:29,019 --> 01:50:31,010
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1974
01:50:36,493 --> 01:50:37,755
Stay out.

1975
01:50:38,929 --> 01:50:41,489
Get me! I'm giving out wings!

1976
01:50:44,201 --> 01:50:46,692
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower

1977
01:50:46,803 --> 01:50:48,464
from putting that poison into the capsules.

1978
01:50:48,572 --> 01:50:52,201
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly...

1979
01:50:54,444 --> 01:50:56,844
Hey, what's going on around here?

1980
01:50:57,147 --> 01:50:58,478
What...

1981
01:50:59,650 --> 01:51:02,244
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1982
01:51:08,191 --> 01:51:09,818
Look, who are you?

1983
01:51:10,093 --> 01:51:12,618
I told you, George. I'm your guardian angel.

1984
01:51:12,729 --> 01:51:14,924
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that.

1985
01:51:20,570 --> 01:51:23,801
What else are you? What, are you a hypnotist?

1986
01:51:23,907 --> 01:51:25,033
No. Of course not.

1987
01:51:25,142 --> 01:51:27,702
Well, then, why am I seeing all these strange things here?

1988
01:51:27,811 --> 01:51:32,214
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.

1989
01:51:32,316 --> 01:51:36,616
- Well, if I wasn't born, who am I? - You're nobody. You have no identity.

1990
01:51:36,720 --> 01:51:39,348
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.

1991
01:51:39,456 --> 01:51:41,481
There is no George Bailey.

1992
01:51:42,626 --> 01:51:46,926
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license,

1993
01:51:47,397 --> 01:51:50,093
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1994
01:51:51,134 --> 01:51:53,125
They're not there, either.

1995
01:51:54,404 --> 01:51:56,702
- What? - Zuzu's petals.

1996
01:52:02,212 --> 01:52:04,908
You've been given a great gift, George,

1997
01:52:05,115 --> 01:52:08,676
a chance to see what the world would be like without you.

1998
01:52:11,054 --> 01:52:13,648
Now, wait a minute here. Wait a minute here.

1999
01:52:15,592 --> 01:52:18,857
This is some sort of a funny dream I'm having.

2000
01:52:19,062 --> 01:52:20,859
So long, mister. I'm going home.

2001
01:52:20,964 --> 01:52:23,797
- Home? What home? - Shut up! Cut it out!

2002
01:52:24,334 --> 01:52:28,327
You're crazy! That's what I think. You're screwy.

2003
01:52:28,805 --> 01:52:31,467
You're driving me crazy, too. I'm seeing things here.

2004
01:52:31,575 --> 01:52:33,475
I'm going home and see my wife and family.

2005
01:52:33,577 --> 01:52:36,740
You understand that? And I'm going home alone.

2006
01:52:39,149 --> 01:52:41,014
How am I doing, Joseph?

2007
01:52:41,785 --> 01:52:42,945
Thanks.

2008
01:52:43,320 --> 01:52:45,345
No, I didn't have a drink.

2009
01:53:36,606 --> 01:53:39,131
Hey, hey, where did the Building and Loan move to?

2010
01:53:39,242 --> 01:53:40,231
Building and what?

2011
01:53:40,343 --> 01:53:42,072
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.

2012
01:53:42,179 --> 01:53:44,010
They went out of business years ago.

2013
01:53:44,114 --> 01:53:45,479
That sailor's a liar!

2014
01:53:45,582 --> 01:53:47,846
I know every big shot in this town!

2015
01:53:47,951 --> 01:53:50,476
I know Potter, and I'll have you kicked off the beat.

2016
01:53:50,587 --> 01:53:52,020
Hey, Violet!

2017
01:53:53,256 --> 01:53:55,816
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

2018
01:53:55,926 --> 01:53:58,019
- I know. - I know that girl!

2019
01:53:58,128 --> 01:53:59,891
Take a walk. Beat it.

2020
01:54:01,932 --> 01:54:03,661
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

2021
01:54:05,869 --> 01:54:07,734
Ernie, take me home. I'm going off my nut.

2022
01:54:07,838 --> 01:54:08,827
Where do you live?

2023
01:54:08,939 --> 01:54:10,998
Now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff.

2024
01:54:11,107 --> 01:54:13,598
You know where I live. 320 Sycamore. Now hurry up.

2025
01:54:13,710 --> 01:54:17,146
- All right. 320 Sycamore? - Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

2026
01:54:17,247 --> 01:54:19,044
- Come on. - All right. All right.

2027
01:54:19,683 --> 01:54:21,708
Come on, Ernie, now straighten me out here.

2028
01:54:21,818 --> 01:54:24,810
Look, I've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me.

2029
01:54:24,921 --> 01:54:26,081
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

2030
01:54:26,189 --> 01:54:27,918
and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid?

2031
01:54:28,024 --> 01:54:30,049
- That's right, isn't it? - You seen my wife?

2032
01:54:30,160 --> 01:54:33,391
Seen your wife? I've been to your house 100 times.

2033
01:54:33,497 --> 01:54:36,295
Look, bud, what's the idea? I live in a shack in Potter's Field,

2034
01:54:36,399 --> 01:54:38,390
my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid,

2035
01:54:38,502 --> 01:54:40,970
and I ain't never seen you before in my life, see?

2036
01:54:41,071 --> 01:54:43,801
Okay, well, just step on it. Just get me home!

2037
01:55:01,358 --> 01:55:03,622
- Is this the place? - Of course it's the place.

2038
01:55:03,727 --> 01:55:06,924
Well, this house ain't been lived in for 20 years.

2039
01:55:13,003 --> 01:55:14,971
- What's up, Ernie? - I don't know.

2040
01:55:15,071 --> 01:55:18,234
But we better keep our eye on this guy. He's bats.

2041
01:55:35,725 --> 01:55:37,886
Mary. Mary!

2042
01:55:40,897 --> 01:55:43,764
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! Where are you?

2043
01:55:44,234 --> 01:55:46,828
They're not here, George. You have no children.

2044
01:55:46,937 --> 01:55:48,370
Where are they? What have you done with them?

2045
01:55:48,471 --> 01:55:50,598
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves.

2046
01:55:50,707 --> 01:55:52,265
Come on out here, both of you.

2047
01:55:52,375 --> 01:55:54,673
- Bert! Thank heaven you're here. - Back this.

2048
01:55:54,778 --> 01:55:58,043
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

2049
01:55:58,148 --> 01:55:59,775
- Watch him, Bert. - Come on, come on.

2050
01:55:59,883 --> 01:56:01,908
Bert, Ernie. What's the matter with you two guys?

2051
01:56:02,018 --> 01:56:03,485
You were here on my wedding night.

2052
01:56:03,587 --> 01:56:05,179
You, both of you, stood out there on the porch

2053
01:56:05,288 --> 01:56:07,586
- and sung to us, don't you remember? - Think I'd better be going.

2054
01:56:07,691 --> 01:56:08,988
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid,

2055
01:56:09,092 --> 01:56:10,218
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

2056
01:56:10,327 --> 01:56:12,261
- Everything's gonna be all right. - Bert, no, listen to me.

2057
01:56:12,362 --> 01:56:14,193
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house?

2058
01:56:14,297 --> 01:56:16,765
Bert, listen. It's that fellow here. He says he's an angel.

2059
01:56:16,866 --> 01:56:20,267
- He's trying to hypnotize me. - I hate to do this to you, bud, but...

2060
01:56:21,638 --> 01:56:24,334
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

2061
01:56:26,076 --> 01:56:28,840
- Joseph! Help! Help! - Oh, shut up.

2062
01:56:29,012 --> 01:56:31,776
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

2063
01:56:37,621 --> 01:56:40,256
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had him right here.

2064
01:56:40,256 --> 01:56:40,881
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? I had him right here.

2065
01:56:43,660 --> 01:56:45,184
I need a drink.

2066
01:56:45,695 --> 01:56:48,289
Well, which way did he go? Help me find him.

2067
01:56:58,241 --> 01:56:59,333
Well?

2068
01:57:02,612 --> 01:57:03,772
Mother.

2069
01:57:05,815 --> 01:57:07,806
Mother? What do you want?

2070
01:57:09,052 --> 01:57:11,646
Mother, this is George.

2071
01:57:12,055 --> 01:57:13,818
I thought sure you'd remember me.

2072
01:57:13,923 --> 01:57:15,322
George who?

2073
01:57:15,425 --> 01:57:17,256
If you're looking for a room, there's no vacancy.

2074
01:57:17,360 --> 01:57:20,693
Mother, listen. Please help me. Something terrible's happened to me.

2075
01:57:20,797 --> 01:57:23,197
I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody.

2076
01:57:23,299 --> 01:57:26,234
Please let me come in, and keep me here until I get over it.

2077
01:57:26,336 --> 01:57:28,668
Get over what? I don't take in strangers

2078
01:57:28,772 --> 01:57:31,263
unless they're sent here by somebody I know.

2079
01:57:31,641 --> 01:57:36,601
Well, I know everybody you know. Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2080
01:57:36,713 --> 01:57:38,408
- You know him? - Well, sure I do.

2081
01:57:38,515 --> 01:57:40,642
- When did you see him last? - Today over at his house.

2082
01:57:40,750 --> 01:57:41,842
It's a lie.

2083
01:57:41,951 --> 01:57:44,818
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.

2084
01:57:44,921 --> 01:57:47,754
And if you ask me, that's where you belong.

2085
01:57:59,703 --> 01:58:01,330
Strange, isn't it?

2086
01:58:01,838 --> 01:58:04,739
Each man's life touches so many other lives.

2087
01:58:05,208 --> 01:58:08,143
And when he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2088
01:58:08,244 --> 01:58:09,404
I've heard of things like this.

2089
01:58:09,512 --> 01:58:11,241
You got me in some kind of a spell or something.

2090
01:58:11,347 --> 01:58:13,406
Well, I'm gonna get out of it. I'll get out of it.

2091
01:58:13,516 --> 01:58:15,279
I know how, too. I...

2092
01:58:15,719 --> 01:58:16,845
The last man I talked to,

2093
01:58:16,953 --> 01:58:19,080
before all this stuff started happening to me, was Martini.

2094
01:58:19,189 --> 01:58:20,383
You know where he lives?

2095
01:58:20,490 --> 01:58:23,357
Well, sure, I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.

2096
01:58:26,996 --> 01:58:31,433
- Are you sure this is Bailey Park? - No, I'm not sure of anything anymore.

2097
01:58:32,335 --> 01:58:35,133
All I know is this should be Bailey Park.

2098
01:58:35,972 --> 01:58:39,669
- But where are the houses? - You weren't here to build them.

2099
01:58:44,280 --> 01:58:47,272
Your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice

2100
01:58:47,383 --> 01:58:49,248
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2101
01:58:49,352 --> 01:58:51,411
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.

2102
01:58:51,521 --> 01:58:52,954
He got the Congressional Medal of Honor.

2103
01:58:53,056 --> 01:58:54,990
He saved the lives of every man on that transport.

2104
01:58:55,091 --> 01:58:57,116
Every man on that transport died.

2105
01:58:57,227 --> 01:58:58,524
Harry wasn't there to save them,

2106
01:58:58,628 --> 01:59:01,324
because you weren't there to save Harry.

2107
01:59:12,542 --> 01:59:16,034
You see, George? You really had a wonderful life.

2108
01:59:16,546 --> 01:59:20,573
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?

2109
01:59:21,284 --> 01:59:23,184
- Clarence. - Yes, George?

2110
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:27,417
- Where's Mary? - Oh, well, I can't...

2111
01:59:27,524 --> 01:59:30,015
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me, where is she?

2112
01:59:30,126 --> 01:59:32,094
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.

2113
01:59:32,195 --> 01:59:35,164
- I'm not supposed to tell. - Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

2114
01:59:35,265 --> 01:59:37,563
- You're not gonna like it, George. - Where is she?

2115
01:59:37,667 --> 01:59:39,999
She's an old maid. She never married.

2116
01:59:40,103 --> 01:59:42,435
Where is Mary? Where is she? Where is she?

2117
01:59:42,539 --> 01:59:45,406
She's just about to close up the library!

2118
01:59:49,312 --> 01:59:52,679
There must be some easier way for me to get my wings.

2119
02:00:04,227 --> 02:00:05,285
Mary!

2120
02:00:10,967 --> 02:00:12,025
Mary!

2121
02:00:14,470 --> 02:00:15,562
Mary!

2122
02:00:17,006 --> 02:00:18,496
Mary! Mary!

2123
02:00:18,741 --> 02:00:21,437
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me? What's happened to us?

2124
02:00:21,544 --> 02:00:22,875
I don't know you. Let me go!

2125
02:00:22,979 --> 02:00:26,005
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me. Please, Mary, help me.

2126
02:00:26,115 --> 02:00:28,242
Where's our kids? I need you, Mary.

2127
02:00:28,952 --> 02:00:30,681
Help me, Mary!

2128
02:00:30,987 --> 02:00:32,579
Mary! Let me go!

2129
02:00:32,889 --> 02:00:34,584
Help! It's a wild man!

2130
02:00:35,859 --> 02:00:38,521
The wild man is chasing me. Somebody stop him!

2131
02:00:38,628 --> 02:00:41,153
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

2132
02:00:41,898 --> 02:00:43,229
That's my wife!

2133
02:00:45,802 --> 02:00:47,292
- Mary! - No, you don't.

2134
02:00:47,403 --> 02:00:48,495
Somebody call the police.

2135
02:00:48,605 --> 02:00:49,902
Somebody hit him on the head with a bottle.

2136
02:00:50,006 --> 02:00:52,099
You need a straightjacket.

2137
02:00:53,243 --> 02:00:54,505
Clarence!

2138
02:00:55,011 --> 02:00:56,569
Get out of here!

2139
02:00:56,679 --> 02:00:57,907
Clarence!

2140
02:00:59,649 --> 02:01:02,083
- Clarence! - Right, that's you!

2141
02:01:05,221 --> 02:01:06,552
Stand back!

2142
02:01:10,326 --> 02:01:11,588
Clarence!

2143
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:22,032
Clarence!

2144
02:01:27,010 --> 02:01:29,205
Clarence! Clarence!

2145
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:32,541
Help me, Clarence!

2146
02:01:33,716 --> 02:01:35,081
Get me back!

2147
02:01:35,985 --> 02:01:38,886
Get me back. I don't care what happens to me.

2148
02:01:39,289 --> 02:01:41,621
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2149
02:01:41,824 --> 02:01:43,849
Help me, Clarence, please.

2150
02:01:44,394 --> 02:01:48,990
Please. I want to live again. I want to live again.

2151
02:01:50,767 --> 02:01:54,726
I want to live again. Please, God, let me live again.

2152
02:02:03,813 --> 02:02:05,212
Hey, George!

2153
02:02:06,649 --> 02:02:07,809
George!

2154
02:02:08,885 --> 02:02:10,876
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2155
02:02:10,987 --> 02:02:13,421
Now get out of here, Bert, or I'll hit you again! Get out of here!

2156
02:02:13,523 --> 02:02:15,218
What the sam hill are you yelling for, George?

2157
02:02:15,325 --> 02:02:16,792
You...

2158
02:02:18,161 --> 02:02:21,028
George? Bert, do you know me?

2159
02:02:21,397 --> 02:02:23,365
Know you? You kidding?

2160
02:02:23,466 --> 02:02:25,593
I've been looking all over town trying to find you.

2161
02:02:25,702 --> 02:02:28,637
I saw your car piled into that tree down there, and I thought maybe you...

2162
02:02:28,738 --> 02:02:30,968
Hey, your mouth's bleeding. Are you sure you're all right?

2163
02:02:31,074 --> 02:02:32,541
What did...

2164
02:02:36,446 --> 02:02:39,574
My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's...

2165
02:02:39,882 --> 02:02:42,908
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!

2166
02:02:43,019 --> 02:02:45,920
Bert! What do you know about that?

2167
02:02:46,022 --> 02:02:49,753
- Merry Christmas! - Well, Merry Christmas.

2168
02:02:50,226 --> 02:02:53,286
Mary! Mary!

2169
02:03:01,971 --> 02:03:03,939
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2170
02:03:06,976 --> 02:03:08,341
Merry Christmas!

2171
02:03:08,444 --> 02:03:10,241
- Merry Christmas, George! - Merry Christmas!

2172
02:03:10,346 --> 02:03:12,211
Merry Christmas, George.

2173
02:03:12,315 --> 02:03:14,681
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2174
02:03:15,284 --> 02:03:17,548
Merry Christmas, emporium!

2175
02:03:18,821 --> 02:03:22,484
Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2176
02:03:26,729 --> 02:03:30,290
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2177
02:03:30,400 --> 02:03:33,096
Happy New Year to you in jail!

2178
02:03:33,202 --> 02:03:35,227
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2179
02:03:36,839 --> 02:03:39,808
Mary! Mary!

2180
02:03:41,544 --> 02:03:42,602
Mary!

2181
02:03:43,546 --> 02:03:46,379
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner! How are you?

2182
02:03:46,482 --> 02:03:48,677
- Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit. - I know, $8,000.

2183
02:03:48,785 --> 02:03:50,218
George, I've got a little paper here.

2184
02:03:50,319 --> 02:03:51,581
I'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

2185
02:03:51,687 --> 02:03:53,314
Isn't it wonderful? I'm going to jail!

2186
02:03:53,423 --> 02:03:55,789
Merry Christmas! Reporters? Where's Mary?

2187
02:03:55,892 --> 02:03:58,690
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful, old drafty house.

2188
02:03:58,795 --> 02:04:01,025
Mary! Mary!

2189
02:04:02,331 --> 02:04:03,389
Mary.

2190
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:05,827
Have you seen my wife?

2191
02:04:05,935 --> 02:04:08,802
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

2192
02:04:08,905 --> 02:04:10,896
Kids! Pete!

2193
02:04:15,611 --> 02:04:16,873
Kids! Janie!

2194
02:04:16,979 --> 02:04:18,446
Janie! Tommy!

2195
02:04:20,583 --> 02:04:23,416
Let me look at you. Oh, I could eat you up.

2196
02:04:24,220 --> 02:04:25,278
Where's your mother?

2197
02:04:25,388 --> 02:04:27,151
- She went looking for you. - With Uncle Billy.

2198
02:04:27,256 --> 02:04:28,951
- Daddy! - Zuzu!

2199
02:04:29,058 --> 02:04:31,583
Zuzu, my little gingersnap. How do you feel?

2200
02:04:31,694 --> 02:04:34,959
- Fine! Not a smidge of temperature. - Not a smidge of...

2201
02:04:35,665 --> 02:04:37,599
- Hallelujah! - Hello.

2202
02:04:38,367 --> 02:04:41,237
- George! George, darling! - Mary! Mary!

2203
02:04:41,237 --> 02:04:41,498
- George! George, darling! - Mary! Mary!

2204
02:04:41,604 --> 02:04:43,799
George, darling. Where have you been?

2205
02:04:43,906 --> 02:04:47,205
- Oh, George, George, George. - Mary.

2206
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:50,507
Let me touch you. Let me touch you. Are you real?

2207
02:04:52,014 --> 02:04:54,107
George, George.

2208
02:04:54,217 --> 02:04:56,117
You have no idea what's happened to me.

2209
02:04:56,219 --> 02:04:58,187
You've no idea what happened...

2210
02:04:59,088 --> 02:05:01,181
Well, come on, George. Come on downstairs, quick.

2211
02:05:01,290 --> 02:05:02,621
- They're on their way. - All right.

2212
02:05:02,725 --> 02:05:03,919
Come on.

2213
02:05:06,362 --> 02:05:08,091
Come on in here now.

2214
02:05:09,298 --> 02:05:10,925
Now, you stand right over here by the tree.

2215
02:05:11,033 --> 02:05:13,263
Right there, and don't move. Don't move.

2216
02:05:13,369 --> 02:05:14,893
What's happening? Who's gonna come?

2217
02:05:15,338 --> 02:05:16,669
I hear them coming now.

2218
02:05:16,772 --> 02:05:19,172
George, it's a miracle. It's a miracle.

2219
02:05:19,275 --> 02:05:21,470
- What's happening? - What's happening?

2220
02:05:21,577 --> 02:05:23,545
- Who's gonna come, Daddy? - Who, Daddy?

2221
02:05:23,646 --> 02:05:27,275
Come in, Uncle Billy. Everybody, in here.

2222
02:05:27,383 --> 02:05:28,577
George.

2223
02:05:30,086 --> 02:05:32,281
Here's everything right here.

2224
02:05:33,623 --> 02:05:37,218
Isn't it wonderful? So many friends. Mary did it, George! Mary did it!

2225
02:05:37,326 --> 02:05:38,884
She told some people you were in trouble,

2226
02:05:38,995 --> 02:05:40,929
and they scattered all over town collecting money.

2227
02:05:41,030 --> 02:05:42,122
Didn't ask any questions.

2228
02:05:42,231 --> 02:05:43,892
Just said, "George in trouble? Then count me in."

2229
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:45,695
- What is this... - You never saw anything like it.

2230
02:05:45,801 --> 02:05:47,894
...another run on the bank?

2231
02:05:48,004 --> 02:05:50,472
Here you are, George. Merry Christmas.

2232
02:05:50,573 --> 02:05:52,541
Now, don't crowd. Don't push. There we are.

2233
02:05:52,642 --> 02:05:54,769
The line forms on the right.

2234
02:05:55,144 --> 02:05:56,771
More coming, George.

2235
02:05:56,879 --> 02:05:59,370
Merry Christmas, and God bless you.

2236
02:06:00,449 --> 02:06:02,041
Merry Christmas.

2237
02:06:02,418 --> 02:06:04,784
- Oh, Mr. Martini! - Merry Christmas.

2238
02:06:04,887 --> 02:06:07,355
Martini! Step right up here.

2239
02:06:08,124 --> 02:06:10,524
I busted the jukebox, too.

2240
02:06:13,729 --> 02:06:15,219
Oh, Mr. Gower!

2241
02:06:17,500 --> 02:06:20,196
I made the rounds of my charge accounts.

2242
02:06:28,077 --> 02:06:31,137
I'm not gonna go, George. I changed my mind.

2243
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:32,879
Violet Bick.

2244
02:06:33,683 --> 02:06:35,344
Oh, Annie! Annie!

2245
02:06:36,586 --> 02:06:38,850
I've been saving this money for a divorce,

2246
02:06:38,955 --> 02:06:40,923
if ever I get a husband.

2247
02:06:42,258 --> 02:06:43,384
Merry Christmas.

2248
02:06:45,628 --> 02:06:48,961
There you are, George. I got the faculty all up and out of bed.

2249
02:06:49,065 --> 02:06:51,329
Here's something for you to play with.

2250
02:06:52,868 --> 02:06:55,996
I wouldn't have a roof over my head if it wasn't for you, George.

2251
02:06:56,105 --> 02:06:59,597
Just a minute. Just a minute. Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.

2252
02:06:59,709 --> 02:07:01,870
Now, get this, it's from London.

2253
02:07:02,812 --> 02:07:05,372
"Mr. Gower cabled you need cash. Stop.

2254
02:07:05,615 --> 02:07:09,881
"My office instructed to advance you up to $25,000. Stop.

2255
02:07:09,986 --> 02:07:12,978
"Hee-haw and Merry Christmas. Sam Wainwright."

2256
02:07:23,232 --> 02:07:25,632
And Mr. Martini. How about some wine?

2257
02:07:31,641 --> 02:07:35,338
Hark the herald angels sing

2258
02:07:35,444 --> 02:07:39,710
Glory to the newborn king

2259
02:07:39,815 --> 02:07:44,149
Peace on earth and mercy mild

2260
02:07:44,253 --> 02:07:48,314
God and sinners reconciled

2261
02:07:48,424 --> 02:07:52,724
Joyful, all ye nations rise

2262
02:07:52,828 --> 02:07:56,889
Join the triumph of the skies

2263
02:07:56,999 --> 02:08:01,129
With angelic host proclaim

2264
02:08:01,237 --> 02:08:04,798
Christ is born in Bethlehem

2265
02:08:04,907 --> 02:08:06,374
Harry Bailey!

2266
02:08:11,881 --> 02:08:14,111
George, you old son of a gun.

2267
02:08:14,383 --> 02:08:16,613
Harry. Harry.

2268
02:08:16,886 --> 02:08:18,046
Looks like I got here too late.

2269
02:08:18,154 --> 02:08:20,748
Mary, I got him here from the airport just as quick as I could.

2270
02:08:20,856 --> 02:08:22,619
The fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard.

2271
02:08:22,725 --> 02:08:24,454
Harry, how about your banquet in New York?

2272
02:08:24,560 --> 02:08:27,188
Oh, I left right in the middle of it as soon as I got Mary's telegram.

2273
02:08:27,296 --> 02:08:29,264
Good idea, Ernie. A toast

2274
02:08:29,365 --> 02:08:32,630
to my big brother, George, the richest man in town!

2275
02:08:34,804 --> 02:08:40,242
Should auld acquaintance be forgot

2276
02:08:40,343 --> 02:08:45,838
And never brought to mind?

2277
02:08:45,948 --> 02:08:47,575
Should auld acquaintance

2278
02:08:50,619 --> 02:08:51,643
Be forgot

2279
02:08:51,754 --> 02:08:56,157
And days of auld lang syne

2280
02:08:56,258 --> 02:08:57,657
Who's that?

2281
02:08:58,794 --> 02:09:02,355
That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.

2282
02:09:03,199 --> 02:09:04,325
Look, Daddy!

2283
02:09:04,433 --> 02:09:09,803
Teacher says every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings.

2284
02:09:10,606 --> 02:09:12,073
That's right.

2285
02:09:12,641 --> 02:09:14,108
That's right.

2286
02:09:15,644 --> 02:09:16,770
Attaboy, Clarence.

2287
02:09:16,879 --> 02:09:19,507
Auld lang syne

2288
02:09:19,615 --> 02:09:24,985
For auld lang syne, my dear

2289
02:09:25,087 --> 02:09:30,286
For auld lang syne

2290
02:09:30,393 --> 02:09:35,854
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2291
02:09:35,965 --> 02:09:41,699
For auld lang syne

2292
02:09:42,204 --> 02:09:47,540
We'll drink a cup of kindness yet

2293
02:09:47,643 --> 02:09:53,104
For auld lang syne

2294
02:10:35,643 --> 02:10:37,104
5@y3
