1
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,045
I owe everything to George Bailey.

2
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,339
Help him, dear Father.

3
00:01:30,716 --> 00:01:33,760
Joseph, Jesus and Mary,

4
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:36,471
help my friend Mr. Bailey.

5
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,515
Help my son George tonight.

6
00:01:40,392 --> 00:01:42,268
He never thinks about himself, God.

7
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,103
That's why he's in trouble.

8
00:01:44,188 --> 00:01:45,354
George is a good guy.

9
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:47,774
Give him a break, God.

10
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,942
l love him, dear Lord.

11
00:01:50,027 --> 00:01:51,944
Watch over him tonight.

12
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,738
Please, God.

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,115
Something's the matter with Daddy.

14
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,493
Please bring Daddy back.

15
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,620
PIease bring Daddy home.

16
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,914
Watch over him tonight.

17
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,583
PIease bring Daddy back.

18
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:11,464
Hello, Joseph. Trouble?

19
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,175
Looks like we'll have to send someone down.

20
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:17,345
A lot of people asking for help for a man named George Bailey.

21
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:18,971
George Bailey?

22
00:02:19,056 --> 00:02:21,516
Yes. Tonight's his crucial night. You're right.

23
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,477
We'll have to send someone down immediately. Whose turn is it?

24
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:26,896
That's why l came to see you, sir.

25
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,565
lt's that clockmaker's turn again.

26
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,902
Oh, Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he?

27
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:34,862
We've passed him up right along.

28
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:38,407
Because, you know, sir, he's got the lQ of a rabbit.

29
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,953
Yes, but he's got the faith of a child. Simple.

30
00:02:42,037 --> 00:02:44,080
Joseph, send for Clarence.

31
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:48,751
You sent for me, sir?

32
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,879
Yes, Clarence. A man down on Earth needs our help.

33
00:02:51,964 --> 00:02:53,548
Splendid. ls he sick?

34
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:55,842
No, worse. He's discouraged.

35
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:58,511
At exactly 1 0:45 p.m. Earth time,

36
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,638
that man will be thinking seriously

37
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,682
of throwing away God's greatest gift.

38
00:03:02,766 --> 00:03:06,352
Oh, dear, dear, his life? Then l've only an hour to dress.

39
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,687
What are they wearing now?

40
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,898
You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.

41
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,985
Sir, if l should accomplish this mission,

42
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:17,530
l mean, might l perhaps win my wings?

43
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,032
l've been waiting for over 200 years now, sir,

44
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,701
and people are beginning to talk.

45
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,244
What's that book you've got there?

46
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,496
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.

47
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,957
Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey

48
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,375
and you'll get your wings.

49
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,210
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.

50
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:34,046
Poor George. Sit down.

51
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,256
Sit down? What are we...

52
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,049
lf you're going to help a man,

53
00:03:37,134 --> 00:03:39,468
you want to know something about him, don't you?

54
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,053
Well, naturally, of course. l...

55
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,430
Now, keep your eyes open.

56
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,390
See the town?

57
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,184
Where? I don't see a thing.

58
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,104
Oh, l forgot. You haven't got your wings yet.

59
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:53,149
Now, Iook, I'II heIp you out. Concentrate.

60
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:55,610
Begin to see something?

61
00:03:55,694 --> 00:03:58,404
Why, yes. This is amazing.

62
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:01,073
If you ever get your wings, you'II see aII by yourseIf.

63
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,909
Oh, wonderful.

64
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:05,703
Yay! Yippee!

65
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:07,747
Okay, boys, let's go.

66
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,540
Hey, who's that?

67
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:11,459
That's your problem. George Bailey.

68
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:12,585
A boy?

69
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,755
That's him when he was 12 back in 1919.

70
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:19,175
Something happens here you'II have to remember Iater on.

71
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:21,594
Come on, Marty.

72
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,554
Let's go, Marty!

73
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,848
Attaboy, Marty.

74
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,392
Hee-haw!

75
00:04:28,477 --> 00:04:30,436
Let's go, Sam. Hee-haw, Sammy!

76
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:35,608
Here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother Harry Bailey.

77
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,443
l'm not scared.

78
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,946
Come on, Harry.

79
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,989
Let's go, Harry!

80
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,617
Come on, Harry!

81
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:46,744
-Come on, Harry! -Come on, Harry!

82
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:48,829
Help, George, help!

83
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:50,039
Help!

84
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,626
Don't worry, Harry. l'm coming!

85
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:56,003
-Help! -Hang on, Harry!

86
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,547
-Help. -Make a chain, gang.

87
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:01,133
George saved his brother's life that day,

88
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,887
but he caught a bad coId which infected his left ear.

89
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,556
Cost him his hearing in that ear.

90
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,934
lt was weeks before he was abIe to go back

91
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,396
to his after-schooI job at old man Gower's drugstore.

92
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,272
Mr. Potter.

93
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,650
Who's that, a king?

94
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,652
That's Henry F. Potter,

95
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,072
the richest and meanest man in the county.

96
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,578
-Hee-haw! Hee-haw! -Hee-haw! Hee-haw!

97
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,039
Go to work, slave.

98
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,251
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

99
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,671
Wish l had a million dollars.

100
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,548
Hot dog!

101
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:46,345
lt's me, Mr. Gower. George Bailey.

102
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,388
You're late.

103
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,764
Yes, sir.

104
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,441
Hello, George.

105
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,067
Hello, Mary.

106
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,694
Hello, Violet.

107
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,362
Two cents' worth of shoelaces?

108
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:04,822
She was here first.

109
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,741
l'm still thinking.

110
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,867
Shoelaces?

111
00:06:07,951 --> 00:06:09,577
Please, Georgie.

112
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,203
l like him.

113
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,039
You like every boy.

114
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,790
What's wrong with that?

115
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,375
Here you are.

116
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,377
Help me down?

117
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,379
Help you down?

118
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:28,888
Made up your mind yet?

119
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:30,765
l'll take chocolate.

120
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,559
-With coconuts? -l don't like coconuts.

121
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,603
You don't like coconuts?

122
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:39,106
Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from?

123
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,108
Lookit here.

124
00:06:41,193 --> 00:06:44,403
From Tahiti, the Fiji islands, the Coral Sea.

125
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:47,948
A new magazine. l never saw it before.

126
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,493
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it.

127
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,039
l've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.

128
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,459
ls this the ear you can't hear on?

129
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:02,254
George Bailey, l'll love you till the day l die.

130
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,299
l'm going out exploring someday. You watch.

131
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,636
And l'm gonna have a couple of harems and maybe three or four wives.

132
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,970
Wait and see.

133
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:16,352
-George. George! -Yes, sir?

134
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,896
You're not paid to be a canary.

135
00:07:19,189 --> 00:07:20,523
No, sir.

136
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,886
Mr. Gower, do you want something? Anything?

137
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,096
No.

138
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,432
-Anything l can do back here? -No.

139
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,351
l'll get them, sir.

140
00:07:57,435 --> 00:08:00,229
Quick, take those capsules over to Mrs. Blaine.

141
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,648
She's waiting for them.

142
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,066
Yes, sir.

143
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,757
They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?

144
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:29,925
Yeah.

145
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,760
ls it a charge, sir?

146
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,429
Yes, George.

147
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,139
Mr. Gower, l...

148
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:37,641
-Oh, get going. -Yes, sir.

149
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:06,337
Avast there, Captain Cook. Where you heading?

150
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:08,881
-l've got to see Pop, Uncle Billy. -Some other time, George.

151
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,716
-lt's important. -There's a squall in there.

152
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,343
lt's shaping up into a storm.

153
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,553
-Uncle Billy, telephone. -Who is it?

154
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,889
-Bank examiner. -Bank examiner?

155
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:19,183
l should have called him yesterday.

156
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,893
Switch it inside.

157
00:09:23,146 --> 00:09:24,563
l'm not crying, Mr. Potter.

158
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,523
Well, you're begging. That's a whole lot worse.

159
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,400
All l'm asking for is 30 days more.

160
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:29,735
-Pop. -Just a minute, Son.

161
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:32,529
Just 30 short days. l'll dig up that $5,000 somehow.

162
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,031
-Shove me up, shove me up. -Pop.

163
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,908
-Just a minute. -Have you put any real pressure

164
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:38,452
on these people of yours to pay those mortgages?

165
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,871
Times are bad, Mr. Potter. A lot of these people are out of work.

166
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:42,039
Well, then, foreclose.

167
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,749
l can't do that. These families have children.

168
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,417
-Pop. -They're not my children.

169
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:47,419
But they're somebody's children, Mr. Potter.

170
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:50,047
Are you running a business or a charity ward?

171
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,258
-Well, all right... -Not with my money.

172
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:54,927
Mr. Potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character?

173
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,845
You have no family, no children.

174
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,764
You can't begin to spend all the money you've got.

175
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:02,101
l suppose l should give it to miserable failures

176
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,437
like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.

177
00:10:05,522 --> 00:10:06,730
He's not a failure!

178
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:09,608
-You can't say that about my father. -George, George. Quiet, George.

179
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,068
You're not. You're the biggest man in town...

180
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,653
-Run along, run along. -...bigger than him,

181
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,905
-bigger than everybody. -Gives you an idea of the Baileys.

182
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,740
Don't let him say that about you, Pop.

183
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,450
All right, Son. All right. Thanks.

184
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,327
l'll talk to you tonight.

185
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,669
What?

186
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,089
Why, that medicine should have been there an hour ago.

187
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,134
lt will be over in five minutes, Mrs. Blaine.

188
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:41,307
Where's Mrs. Blaine's box of capsules?

189
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:43,058
l... You...

190
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:45,227
Didn't you hear what l said?

191
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,395
Yes, sir. l...

192
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,981
What kind of tricks are you playing anyway?

193
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:53,736
Why didn't you deliver them right away?

194
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,321
Don't you know that boy's very sick?

195
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,905
You're hurting my sore ear.

196
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,574
You lazy loafer.

197
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,576
Mr. Gower, you don't know what you're doing.

198
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,536
You put something wrong in those capsules.

199
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,871
l know you're unhappy.

200
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:05,664
You got the telegram, and you're upset.

201
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,583
You put something bad in those capsules.

202
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,002
lt wasn't your fault, Mr. Gower.

203
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,463
Just look and see what you did.

204
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,132
The bottle you took the powder from, it's poison.

205
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,925
l tell you, it's poison.

206
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,844
l know you feel bad.

207
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,934
-Oh! -Don't hurt my sore ear again!

208
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:30,064
-Don't hurt my sore ear again. -Oh, no, no. Oh, George, George.

209
00:11:30,148 --> 00:11:32,983
Oh, Mr. Gower, l won't ever tell anyone.

210
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:34,443
l know how you're feeling.

211
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,196
l won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, l won't.

212
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,281
Oh, George. George.

213
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:42,076
An overnight bag. Genuine English cowhide.

214
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,327
Combination lock.

215
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:46,705
-Fitted up with brushes, combs... -Nope, nope, nope, nope.

216
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,832
Now, look, Joe. Now, look.

217
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,460
l want a big one.

218
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,295
What did you stop it for?

219
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,632
I want you to take a good Iook at that face.

220
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,716
Who is it?

221
00:11:57,801 --> 00:11:58,884
George Bailey.

222
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,970
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears sIapped back by the druggist?

223
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,347
That's the kid.

224
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,434
It's a good face. I Iike it.

225
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,311
l like George Bailey.

226
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,439
Tell me, did he ever teII anyone about the piIIs?

227
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:13,690
Not a soul.

228
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,777
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go expIoring?

229
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,612
Well, wait and see.

230
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,448
Big, see? l don't want one for one night.

231
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,534
l want something for 1 ,001 nights

232
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:28,080
with plenty of room here for labels from ltaly and Baghdad, Samarkand.

233
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,331
Great big thing, about...

234
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,583
-l see. A flying carpet, huh? -Yeah.

235
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,086
l don't suppose you'd like this old secondhand job, would you?

236
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,379
Now you're talking.

237
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,340
Gee whiz, l could use that as a raft in case the boat sunk.

238
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:40,676
-How much this cost? -No charge.

239
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:43,429
That's my trick ear, Joe. lt sounded like you said "no charge."

240
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,513
That's right.

241
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:47,433
Well, what's my name doing on it?

242
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:50,561
A little present from old man Gower. Came down and picked it out himself.

243
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:54,022
He did? What do you know about that? My old boss. lsn't that nice?

244
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,357
What boat are you sailing on?

245
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,942
l'm working across on a cattle boat.

246
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,194
-A cattle boat? -Okay, l like cows.

247
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,449
Hello, Mr. Gower. How are you?

248
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:05,951
Thanks ever so much for the baggage. lt's just exactly what l wanted.

249
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,119
Forget it.

250
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,788
-lt's wonderful of you to think of me. -Hope you enjoy it.

251
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,665
l wish l had a million dollars.

252
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,000
Hot dog!

253
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,335
Avast there, Captain Cook!

254
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,629
-You got your sea legs yet? -Parlez-vous francais, mister?

255
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:20,007
Hey, send us some of those picture postcards, will you, George?

256
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:21,842
Hey, George, don't take any plug nickels.

257
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,594
Hey, George, your suitcase is leaking.

258
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,887
Hey, Ernie!

259
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,431
-Hi, Ernie. Hi, Bert. -Hiya, George.

260
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,308
-George. -Hey, l'm a rich tourist today.

261
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,809
How about driving me home in style?

262
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:32,603
-Hop in, Your Highness. Hop in. -Yes, sir.

263
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:35,564
And for the carriage trade, l put on my hat.

264
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,401
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.

265
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,694
Hello, Violet.

266
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,071
Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.

267
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,656
This old thing?

268
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,618
Why, l only wear it when l don't care how l look.

269
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,177
-How would you like to take... -Yes.

270
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,263
Want to come along, Bert? We'll show you the town.

271
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,431
No, thanks.

272
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:12,768
l think l'll go home and see what the wife's doing.

273
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,938
Family man.

274
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,192
George, Harry, you're shaking the house down.

275
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,360
Stop it.

276
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:24,112
Let them alone. l wish l was up there with them.

277
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:27,157
But Harry will tear his dinner suit. George!

278
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,159
That's why all children should be girls.

279
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,913
Well, if they were all girls there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.

280
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:35,541
George, Harry, come down to dinner this minute.

281
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,669
Everything's getting cold, and you know how long we've been waiting for you.

282
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,462
-Okay, Ma. -Okay, Ma.

283
00:14:41,798 --> 00:14:43,799
-Ta-da! -Ta-da!

284
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,929
-We got a present for you, Pop. -There you are.

285
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,808
Oh, you two idiots.

286
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,851
George, sit down and have dinner.

287
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:55,894
-Fine. -l've eaten.

288
00:14:55,979 --> 00:14:58,730
Well, aren't you gonna finish dressing for your graduating party? Look at you!

289
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,232
l don't care. lt's George's tux.

290
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,150
Annie, my sweet, have you got those pies?

291
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,444
lf you lay a hand on me, l'll hit you with this broom!

292
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:07,739
Annie, l'm in love with you. There's a moon out tonight.

293
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:11,785
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal in the old Bailey boarding house.

294
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,787
Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.

295
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,248
Pop, can l have the car? l gotta take over a lot of plates and things.

296
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,291
What plates?

297
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:18,750
Mom, l'm chairman of the Eats Committee.

298
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,002
We only need a couple of dozen.

299
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:23,463
Oh, no, you don't, Harry. Now, not my best Haviland, no.

300
00:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,549
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.

301
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,594
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and l are gonna miss you.

302
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,220
l'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

303
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,597
What's the matter? You look tired.

304
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,932
l had another tussle with Potter today.

305
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:36,018
l thought when we put him on the board of directors,

306
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,436
he'd ease up on us a little bit.

307
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,397
What's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?

308
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,400
He's a sick man, frustrated, sick in his mind.

309
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,277
Sick in his soul, if he has one.

310
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:48,113
He hates everybody that has anything that he can't have.

311
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,906
He hates us mostly, l guess.

312
00:15:49,991 --> 00:15:51,325
Gangway. Gangway.

313
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,868
-So long, Pop. -So long.

314
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,953
-You got a match? -Very funny, very funny.

315
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:55,996
Put those things in the car,

316
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,290
and l'll get your tie and studs ready for you. Now, hurry up.

317
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,666
-Okay, Mom. -Now, don't drop one of those.

318
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,959
You coming later, George?

319
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,294
What do you mean, and be bored to death?

320
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:04,004
Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls,

321
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,464
and we're gonna use that new floor tonight, too.

322
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,257
-l hope it works. -No gin tonight, Son.

323
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:08,550
Oh, Pop, just a little?

324
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,469
No, Son. Not one drop.

325
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:13,138
Boys and girls and music.

326
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,140
Why do they need gin?

327
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:18,268
Did l act like that when l graduated from high school?

328
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,519
Pretty much.

329
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,648
You know, George, l wish we could send Harry to college with you.

330
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:25,359
Your mother and l talked it over half the night.

331
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:27,319
We have that all figured out.

332
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,529
You see, Harry will take my job at the Building and Loan,

333
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,366
work there for four years, then he'll go.

334
00:16:32,784 --> 00:16:34,117
Pretty young for that job.

335
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,911
Well, no younger than l was.

336
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,330
Well, you were born older, George.

337
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:40,874
How's that?

338
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,668
l said you were born older.

339
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,127
l suppose you've decided what you want to do

340
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,504
when you get out of college.

341
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,547
Well, you know what l've always talked about,

342
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,051
build things, design new buildings, plan modern cities.

343
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,469
All that stuff l've been talking about.

344
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,346
Still after that first million before you're 30?

345
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,890
l'll settle for half that in cash.

346
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,601
Of course, it's just a hope.

347
00:17:00,603 --> 00:17:01,895
But you wouldn't consider coming back

348
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,189
to the Building and Loan, would you?

349
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,442
Well, l... l...

350
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:12,864
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair? Then you'd be more comfortable,

351
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,825
and you could hear everything that's going on.

352
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,369
l would if l thought l'd hear anything worth listening to.

353
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:18,995
You would, eh?

354
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,289
l know it's soon to talk about it.

355
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,959
No, now, Pop, l couldn't.

356
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,962
l couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life

357
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,839
in a shabby little office.

358
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:33,301
l'm sorry, Pop. l didn't mean that, but l...

359
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:36,012
lt's this business of nickels and dimes

360
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:38,265
and spending all your life trying to figure out

361
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:40,267
how to save three cents on a length of pipe.

362
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,395
l'd go crazy. l want to do something big and something important.

363
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,440
You know, George, l feel that, in a small way,

364
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,442
we're doing something important,

365
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,736
satisfying a fundamental urge.

366
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,115
lt's deep in the race for a man to want his own roof and walls and fireplace.

367
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,159
And we're helping him get those things

368
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,910
in our shabby little office.

369
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:02,664
l know, Pop. l know that.

370
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,791
l wish l felt that...

371
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,296
l've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to...

372
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:12,507
Most of my friends have already finished college.

373
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:16,011
l just feel like if l didn't get away, l'd bust.

374
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:20,724
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.

375
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,517
You see what l mean, don't you, Pop?

376
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,144
This town is no place for any man

377
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,521
unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.

378
00:18:26,606 --> 00:18:29,149
Now, you've got talent, Son. l've seen it.

379
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:33,111
You get yourself an education and get out of here.

380
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:37,491
Pop, you want a shock?

381
00:18:39,035 --> 00:18:41,119
l think you're a great guy.

382
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:46,958
-Why, did you hear that, Annie? -l heard it.

383
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,961
lt's about time one of you lunkheads said it.

384
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,215
l'm gonna miss old Annie.

385
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,846
Pop, l think l'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.

386
00:18:59,931 --> 00:19:01,556
Have a good time, Son.

387
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:07,729
Excuse me.

388
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,356
There you are.

389
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,524
George, hello.

390
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,817
You know my kid brother George.

391
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:13,860
-l'm gonna put him through college. -Hello, George.

392
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,237
Hee-haw!

393
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,696
Sam Wainwright.

394
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,323
How are you? When did you get here?

395
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,492
This afternoon. l thought l'd give the kids a treat.

396
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,993
Old college graduate now.

397
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,162
Yeah, old "Joe College" Wainwright they call me.

398
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:27,040
Well, freshman, looks like you're gonna make it after all, huh?

399
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:29,501
-Harry, you're the guy l want to see. -Hello, Sam.

400
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,670
-Coach has heard all about you. -He has?

401
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:33,588
Yeah, he's followed every game, and his mouth's watering.

402
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:35,841
He wants me to find out if you're gonna come along with us.

403
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:37,467
Well, l got to make some dough first.

404
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:40,095
Well, you better make it fast. We need great ends like you.

405
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,847
Not broken down old guys like this one.

406
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,056
Hee-haw!

407
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:45,517
George, welcome back.

408
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,227
Hello, Mr. Partridge, how are you?

409
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:49,521
Putting a pool under this floor was a great idea.

410
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:50,897
Saved us another building.

411
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,858
Now, Harry, Sam, have a lot of fun.

412
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,735
There's lots of stuff here to eat and drink. Lots of pretty girls around.

413
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:57,696
A third dance... A third...

414
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,866
-Hello, Violet. -Hello. What am l bid?

415
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,158
George.

416
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,077
Marty! Well, it's old home week.

417
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,204
-Marty! -Sam, Harry, how are you?

418
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,206
-Do me a favor, will you, George? -What's that?

419
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,709
-You remember my kid sister Mary. -Oh, yeah. Yeah.

420
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,044
"Mama wants you, Marty. Mama wants you." Remember?

421
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,504
Dance with her, will you?

422
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,716
Oh, me? Well, l feel funny enough already with all these kids.

423
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,842
Come on, be a sport.

424
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:22,220
Just dance with her one time, and you'll give her the thrill of her life. Hey, Sis!

425
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:23,847
Don't be long, Marty.

426
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,640
l'm not being a wet nurse to a...

427
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:27,726
The next thing l knew, some guy came up and tripped me.

428
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:29,728
That's the reason why l came in fourth.

429
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,522
lf it hadn't been for that, that race'd have been a cinch.

430
00:20:32,607 --> 00:20:35,567
l tried to find out who it was later, but l couldn't find out.

431
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:39,321
Nobody'd ever tell you whoever it was, because they'd be scared.

432
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:40,864
'Cause they know what kind of a guy l am.

433
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,074
You remember George. This is Mary.

434
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:44,784
Well, l'll be seeing you.

435
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:45,911
Well, well, well.

436
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,747
Now to get back to my story, see?

437
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,209
Hey, this is my dance.

438
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,878
Why don't you stop annoying people?

439
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:57,088
Well, l'm sorry. Hey!

440
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:02,928
-Well, hello. -Hello.

441
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,597
You look at me as if you didn't know me.

442
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:06,890
Well, l don't.

443
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,267
You've passed me on the street almost every day.

444
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:10,435
Me?

445
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,813
No. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.

446
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:17,567
Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! The big Charleston contest!

447
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,614
The prize, a genuine loving cup.

448
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,450
Those not tapped by the judges will remain on the floor.

449
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:26,701
Let's go!

450
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,463
l'm not very good at this.

451
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,131
Neither am l.

452
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,050
Okay. What can we lose?

453
00:21:53,562 --> 00:21:55,397
Hey, you're wonderful.

454
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,176
What's the matter, Othello? Jealous?

455
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:30,015
Did you know there's a swimming pool under this floor?

456
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:34,310
And did you know that button behind you causes this floor to open up?

457
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,690
And did you further know that George Bailey

458
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,109
is dancing right over that crack?

459
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,320
And l've got the key.

460
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,596
Stand back, everybody! Stand back!

461
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:16,478
They're cheering us. We must be good.

462
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,850
Get out of there!

463
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,477
What... Oh, well.

464
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,237
BuffaIo gaIs can't you come out tonight?

465
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,115
Can't you come out tonight?

466
00:24:10,199 --> 00:24:12,700
BuffaIo gaIs, can't you come out tonight

467
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:16,579
And dance

468
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:19,666
By the Iight

469
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:24,295
Of the moon?

470
00:24:24,797 --> 00:24:27,632
-Oh, hot dog. Just like an organ. -Beautiful.

471
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,926
l told Harry l thought l'd be bored to death.

472
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,262
You should have seen the commotion in that locker room.

473
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:35,098
l had to knock down three people to get this stuff we're wearing here.

474
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,058
Let me hold that old wet dress of yours.

475
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,810
Do l look as funny as you do?

476
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,728
l guess l'm not quite the football type.

477
00:24:40,813 --> 00:24:42,564
You look wonderful!

478
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,315
You know, if it wasn't me talking,

479
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,985
l'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.

480
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,988
Well, why don't you say it?

481
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:53,449
l don't know. Maybe l will say it. How old are you anyway?

482
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,577
Eighteen.

483
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:59,164
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.

484
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,166
Too young or too old?

485
00:25:01,250 --> 00:25:04,002
Oh, no, no. Just right. Your age fits you.

486
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,547
Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.

487
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,009
l mean, without a dress you look older.

488
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:14,012
l mean younger. You look... You just...

489
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,015
l'm on the thing here.

490
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,058
Sir, my train, please.

491
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,853
A pox upon me for a clumsy lout.

492
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:25,190
Your caboose, milady.

493
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,193
You may kiss my hand.

494
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,113
Hey.

495
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,450
Hey, Mary.

496
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,537
As l was lumberin' down the street

497
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,081
Down the street, down the street

498
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:44,751
Okay, then. l'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.

499
00:25:44,835 --> 00:25:47,003
Oh, no, don't. l love that old house.

500
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,005
No, you see, you make a wish and then try and break some glass.

501
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,715
And you got to be a pretty good shot nowadays, too.

502
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,676
Oh, no, George, don't. lt's full of romance, that old place.

503
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:55,970
l'd like to live in it.

504
00:25:56,138 --> 00:25:57,180
ln that place?

505
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,557
l wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now, watch.

506
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:02,310
Right in the second floor, there. See?

507
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,191
What did you wish, George?

508
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,693
Not just one wish, a whole hatful.

509
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,862
Mary, l know what l'm gonna do tomorrow

510
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:15,573
and the next day and next year and the year after that.

511
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:18,493
l'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet,

512
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,328
and l'm gonna see the world!

513
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,498
ltaly, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum.

514
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:26,251
Then l'm coming back here and go to college to see what they know.

515
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,919
And then l'm gonna build things.

516
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,420
l'm gonna build airfields.

517
00:26:29,505 --> 00:26:31,923
l'm gonna build skyscrapers 1 00 stories high.

518
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,384
l'm gonna build bridges a mile long.

519
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,844
What, are you gonna throw a rock?

520
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,684
Hey, that's pretty good.

521
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:45,353
What did you wish, Mary?

522
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,316
BuffaIo gaIs can't you come out tonight?

523
00:26:50,401 --> 00:26:53,278
Can't you come out tonight?

524
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:56,406
BuffaIo gaIs, can't you come out tonight

525
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:59,492
And

526
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:03,621
Dance by the Iight of the moon?

527
00:27:03,706 --> 00:27:05,623
What did you wish when you threw that rock?

528
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:07,125
-Oh, no. -Come on, tell me.

529
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:08,793
lf l told you, it might not come true.

530
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:10,670
What is it you want, Mary?

531
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:13,548
What do you want? You want the moon?

532
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,176
Just say the word, and l'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down.

533
00:27:17,261 --> 00:27:21,055
Hey, that's a pretty good idea. l'll give you the moon, Mary.

534
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,640
l'll take it.

535
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,142
Then what?

536
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:28,104
Well, then you could swallow it, and it would all dissolve, see?

537
00:27:28,564 --> 00:27:31,983
And the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes

538
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:34,068
and the ends of your hair.

539
00:27:35,404 --> 00:27:38,156
-Am l talking too much? -Yes!

540
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:41,451
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?

541
00:27:41,535 --> 00:27:42,577
How's that?

542
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,122
Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death?

543
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,334
You want me to kiss her, huh?

544
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:52,837
Youth is wasted on the wrong people.

545
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:57,258
Hey. Hey, hold on, hey, mister. Come on back out here!

546
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:01,596
l'll show you some kissing that'll put hair back on your head. What are you...

547
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,021
Mary?

548
00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:23,159
Okay, l give up. Where are you?

549
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,371
Over here in the hydrangea bushes.

550
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:28,956
Here you are. Catch.

551
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,460
Wait a minute. What am l doing?

552
00:28:36,632 --> 00:28:39,175
This is a very interesting situation.

553
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,094
Please give me my robe.

554
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,681
A man doesn't get in a situation like this every day.

555
00:28:45,766 --> 00:28:47,767
l'd like to have my robe.

556
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,394
Not in Bedford Falls, anyway.

557
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,687
-Ouch! Oh! -Gesundheit.

558
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,440
-George Bailey! -This requires a little thought here.

559
00:28:54,525 --> 00:28:56,192
Give me my robe.

560
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,694
l've read about things like this, but l've never...

561
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:01,906
Shame on you! l'm gonna tell your mother on you.

562
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,617
My mother's way up on the corner there.

563
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,661
l'll call the police.

564
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,539
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.

565
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,499
Then l'm going to scream!

566
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,001
Maybe l could sell tickets.

567
00:29:14,795 --> 00:29:18,214
Let's see. No, the point is

568
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,008
in order to get this robe... l've got it.

569
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,969
l'll make a deal with you, Mary.

570
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,388
George! George!

571
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,143
George, come on home! Quick!

572
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:32,645
-Your father's had a stroke. -What?

573
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,898
-Mary, Mary, l'm sorry. l've got to go. -Come on, George, let's hurry.

574
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,066
-Did you get a doctor? -Yes.

575
00:29:37,151 --> 00:29:38,985
Campbell's there now.

576
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,205
l think that's all we'll need you for, George.

577
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:54,125
-l know you're anxious to make a train. -l have a taxi waiting downstairs.

578
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,044
l want the board to know that George gave up his trip to Europe

579
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,881
to help straighten things out here these past few months.

580
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,841
Good luck to you at school, George.

581
00:30:01,925 --> 00:30:03,885
-Good luck, George. -Goodbye, George.

582
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:06,596
And now we come to the real purpose of this meeting,

583
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,348
to appoint a successor to our dear friend Peter Bailey.

584
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,601
Mr. Chairman, l'd like to get to my real purpose.

585
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,895
-Wait just a minute now. -Wait for what?

586
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:17,315
l claim this institution is not necessary to this town.

587
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:21,277
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, l make a motion to dissolve this institution

588
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,655
and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.

589
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,657
Potter, you dirty, contemptible... l'll wring his neck.

590
00:30:26,742 --> 00:30:27,783
George, did you hear what that buzzard...

591
00:30:27,868 --> 00:30:28,910
Mr. Chairman.

592
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,786
lt's too soon after Peter Bailey's death

593
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,164
to talk about chloroforming the Building and Loan.

594
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,666
Peter Bailey died three months ago.

595
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,585
l second Mr. Potter's motion.

596
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,086
Very well. ln that case,

597
00:30:39,171 --> 00:30:43,007
l'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw. But before you go,

598
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,260
l'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep sorrow

599
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:48,513
-at the passing of Peter Bailey. -Thank you very much.

600
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:50,556
lt was his faith and devotion

601
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,183
that are responsible for this organization.

602
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,185
l'll go further than that.

603
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:58,689
l'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.

604
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,025
That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

605
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:03,069
considering that you probably drove him to his grave.

606
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:05,988
Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

607
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,532
That's what killed him.

608
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:10,326
Oh, l don't mean any disrespect to him. God rest his soul.

609
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,871
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.

610
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,209
But ideals without common sense can ruin this town.

611
00:31:18,961 --> 00:31:21,796
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop,

612
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,216
you know, that fellow that sits around all day

613
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,052
on his brains in his taxi, you know.

614
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:31,973
l happen to know the bank turned down this loan.

615
00:31:32,057 --> 00:31:33,724
But he comes here,

616
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:38,604
and we're building him a house worth $5,000.

617
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:41,774
-Why? -Well, l handled that, Mr. Potter.

618
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,735
You have all the papers there. His salary, insurance.

619
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,153
l can personally vouch for his character.

620
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,155
-A friend of yours? -Yes, sir.

621
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:52,493
You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here,

622
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,829
you can come and borrow money.

623
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,998
What does that get us?

624
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:59,959
A discontented, lazy rabble

625
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,919
instead of a thrifty working class.

626
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:05,840
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers

627
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:09,093
like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads

628
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,429
with a lot of impossible ideas.

629
00:32:11,513 --> 00:32:13,347
Now, l say...

630
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:16,267
Just a minute. Just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter.

631
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:19,604
You're right when you say my father was no businessman. l know that.

632
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:22,356
Why he ever started this cheap penny-ante Building and Loan

633
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,524
l'll never know.

634
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,444
But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character,

635
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,279
because his whole life was...

636
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,948
Why, in the 25 years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing,

637
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:33,367
he never once thought of himself. lsn't that right, Uncle Billy?

638
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:36,287
He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me.

639
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,123
But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter.

640
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:43,294
And what's wrong with that? Why, here, you're all businessmen here.

641
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:46,631
Don't it make them better citizens, and doesn't it make them better customers?

642
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:48,966
You said that they... What'd you say just a minute ago?

643
00:32:49,051 --> 00:32:50,843
They had to wait and save their money

644
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,386
before they even thought of a decent home.

645
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,138
Wait? Wait for what?

646
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,931
Until their children grow up and leave them?

647
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,184
Until they're so old and broken-down that they...

648
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,895
Do you know how long it takes a working man to save $5,000?

649
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,357
Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about,

650
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:08,361
they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community.

651
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,905
Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die

652
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,782
in a couple of decent rooms and a bath?

653
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,950
Anyway, my father didn't think so.

654
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,912
People were human beings to him, but to you,

655
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,915
a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle.

656
00:33:21,083 --> 00:33:23,542
Well, in my book, he died a much richer man than you'll ever be.

657
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:25,503
l'm not interested in your book.

658
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:28,381
l'm talking about the Building and Loan.

659
00:33:28,465 --> 00:33:30,174
l know very well what you're talking about.

660
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,551
You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on,

661
00:33:32,636 --> 00:33:35,471
and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, l know.

662
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,848
Well, l've said too much. l...

663
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:41,227
You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing.

664
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,895
There's just one thing more, though.

665
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:45,606
This town needs this measly one-horse institution

666
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:49,276
if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to Potter.

667
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,444
Come on, Uncle Billy.

668
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:59,870
Sentimental hogwash. l want my motion.

669
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,542
Boy, oh boy, that was telling him, George, old boy.

670
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,460
You shut his big mouth. You should have heard him.

671
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:08,212
What happened? We heard a lot of yelling.

672
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,965
Well, we're being voted out of business after 25 years.

673
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:14,552
-Easy come, easy go. -Here it is. "Help wanted. Female."

674
00:34:14,636 --> 00:34:16,595
You still want me to hang around, George?

675
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,223
-Yeah, l'll be right down. -Yeah, hey, you'll miss your train.

676
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,100
You're a week late for school already. Go on.

677
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:23,978
-What's going on in there? -Never mind. Don't worry about that.

678
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:27,106
They're putting us out of business. So what? l can get anotherjob.

679
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,899
-l'm only 55. -56.

680
00:34:28,984 --> 00:34:31,360
Go on, go on. Hey, look, you gave up your boat trip,

681
00:34:31,445 --> 00:34:33,028
now you don't want to miss college, too, do you?

682
00:34:33,113 --> 00:34:35,573
George! George! They voted Potter down.

683
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,450
They want to keep it going.

684
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,994
You did it, George. You did it.

685
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,246
They got one condition, only one condition.

686
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:43,914
-What's that? -And that's the best part of it.

687
00:34:43,999 --> 00:34:46,041
They've appointed George here as Executive Secretary

688
00:34:46,126 --> 00:34:47,418
to take his father's place.

689
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,337
-Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy... -You can keep him on. That's all right.

690
00:34:50,422 --> 00:34:52,339
As Secretary, you can hire anyone you like.

691
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:55,050
Dr. Campbell, now let's get this thing straight. l'm leaving.

692
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:56,761
l'm leaving right now. l'm going to school.

693
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,305
This is my last chance. Uncle Billy here, he's your man.

694
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,224
But, George, they'll vote with Potter otherwise.

695
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,062
-l know, l know, he didn't go. -That's right.

696
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:10,483
Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother, Harry,

697
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:12,067
and sent him to college.

698
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,028
Harry became a football star.

699
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,738
Made second team all-American.

700
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,115
Yeah, but what happened to George?

701
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,410
George got four years older, waiting for Harry to come back

702
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,579
and take over the BuiIding and Loans.

703
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:25,956
There are plenty ofjobs around for somebody that likes to travel.

704
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:27,082
Look at this. Here.

705
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:31,462
Venezuela oil fields. "Wanted, man with construction experience."

706
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,589
Here's the Yukon, right here.

707
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,050
"Wanted, man with engineering experience."

708
00:35:37,177 --> 00:35:38,969
There she blows.

709
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:41,972
You know what the three most exciting sounds in the world are?

710
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:44,308
Breakfast is served. Lunch is served. Dinner...

711
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,103
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles.

712
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,314
-Peanut? -There's the professor now.

713
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,733
Old Professor Phi Beta Kappa all-American Bailey.

714
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,860
Why, old George "Geographic Explorer" Bailey.

715
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:57,530
What? No husky dogs? No sled? Uncle Billy, you haven't changed a bit.

716
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,156
Nobody ever changes here, you know that.

717
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,908
Oh, am l glad to see you.

718
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,160
-Say, where's Mother? -She's home, cooking the fatted calf.

719
00:36:03,245 --> 00:36:05,120
-Come on, let's go. -Oh, wait! Wait, wait a minute.

720
00:36:05,205 --> 00:36:08,165
George, Uncle Billy, l want you to meet Ruth.

721
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:09,583
-Hello. -How do you do?

722
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:12,419
-Ruth Dakin. -Ruth Dakin Bailey, if you don't mind.

723
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,880
-Huh? -Well, l wired you l had a surprise.

724
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:16,590
Here she is. Meet the wife.

725
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,510
Well, what do you know? A wife.

726
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:23,389
-Well, how do you do? Congratulations. -How do you do?

727
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,183
What am l doing? Congratulations!

728
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:28,018
-Doggone it, Harry, you... -They're married!

729
00:36:28,103 --> 00:36:30,229
Why don't you tell somebody?

730
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,857
Come on, Mrs. Bailey, l can't wait to see everybody's reaction.

731
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:34,358
-You're really married? -Why, yes.

732
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:36,193
What's a pretty girl like you doing

733
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:38,195
marrying this two-headed brother of mine?

734
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:41,031
Well, l'll tell you. lt's purely mercenary. My father offered him a job.

735
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:45,244
Oh, he got you and the job? Well, Harry's cup runneth over.

736
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:49,915
George, about that job. Ruth spoke out of turn. l never said l'd take it.

737
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,835
You've been holding the bag here for four years, and,

738
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:55,713
well, l won't let you down, George. l would like to...

739
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:58,924
Oh, wait a minute. l forgot the bags. l'll be right back.

740
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:00,217
lt was a surprise to me.

741
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:02,261
This is the new Mrs. Bailey, my nephew's wife.

742
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:06,140
-How are you? -Old, old friend of the Baileys.

743
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,310
Oh, really? What are their names? Let's see...

744
00:37:09,811 --> 00:37:12,354
Oh, of course, l've heard him speak of you.

745
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,815
And l want to tell you, we're gonna give the biggest party

746
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:16,358
this town ever saw.

747
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,863
Here, have some popcorn.

748
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:25,492
George, George, George. That's all Harry ever talks about.

749
00:37:25,702 --> 00:37:27,828
Ruth, this...

750
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,121
What about this job?

751
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,582
Well, my father owns a glass factory in Buffalo.

752
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,418
He wants to get Harry started in the research business.

753
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,712
-Well, is it a good job? -Oh, yes, very.

754
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,423
Not much money, but good future, you know.

755
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,884
-Yeah. -Harry's a genius at research.

756
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:45,346
-My fatherjust fell in love with him. -And you did, too.

757
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:01,028
Hey, Joe.

758
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:04,698
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. l feel so good.

759
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:09,453
l could spit in Potter's eye. l think l will. l think l will.

760
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,039
What did you say? Huh?

761
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,833
Maybe l'd better go home.

762
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,211
Where's my hat? Where's my...

763
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,173
-Oh, thank you, George. Which is mine? -The middle one.

764
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:24,301
Oh, thank you, George. Oh boy, oh boy. Now, look,

765
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:27,763
if you'll point me in the right direction... Would you do that, George?

766
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:28,973
Right down here.

767
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:31,809
Old Building and Loan pal, huh?

768
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,144
Now you just turn this way and then right straight down there.

769
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,354
Oh, that way, huh?

770
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:40,734
My wiId Irish rose

771
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,365
l'm all right. l'm all right.

772
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:51,245
The sweetest flower l know

773
00:39:28,825 --> 00:39:29,950
Hello, Ma.

774
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,746
That's for nothing.

775
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,708
-How do you like her? -She's swell, isn't she?

776
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,544
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.

777
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:42,963
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.

778
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:47,926
Did you know that Mary Hatch is back from school?

779
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,637
Came back three days ago.

780
00:39:52,015 --> 00:39:53,849
Nice girl, Mary.

781
00:39:55,685 --> 00:39:58,479
Kind that'll help you find the answers, George.

782
00:39:59,481 --> 00:40:01,065
Stop that grunting.

783
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,528
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?

784
00:40:06,613 --> 00:40:08,030
Sure. Sam Wainwright.

785
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,074
-Hee-haw? -Yes, Sam's crazy about Mary.

786
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,451
-Well, she's not crazy about him. -Well, how do you know?

787
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:14,286
-What, did she discuss it with you? -No.

788
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:17,081
-Well, then how do you know? -Well, l've got eyes, haven't l?

789
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:20,501
Why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.

790
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:24,129
Besides, Sam Wainwright's away in New York,

791
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:28,217
-and you're here in Bedford Falls. -And all's fair in love and war.

792
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:30,511
l don't know about war.

793
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:37,643
Mother of mine, l can see right through you right to your back-collar button.

794
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:39,728
Trying to get rid of me, huh?

795
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:44,817
Well, here's your hat. What's your hurry?

796
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:48,779
All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal,

797
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,116
l think l'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.

798
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,408
Oh, George.

799
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,537
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction...

800
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,206
This direction.

801
00:41:06,381 --> 00:41:08,048
Good night, Mrs. Bailey.

802
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,146
-Excuse me. -Now, wait a minute.

803
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,356
l think l got a date.

804
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,192
But stick around, fellows, just in case, huh?

805
00:41:28,528 --> 00:41:30,237
We'll wait for you, baby.

806
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,408
-Hello, Georgie Porgie! -Hello Vi.

807
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,703
-What gives? -Nothing.

808
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:39,997
Where are you going?

809
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,958
Oh, l'll probably end up down at the library.

810
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,421
Georgie, don't you ever get tired ofjust reading about things?

811
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:49,548
Yes.

812
00:41:50,425 --> 00:41:52,885
-What are you doing tonight? -Not a thing.

813
00:41:53,469 --> 00:41:55,262
Are you game, Vi? Let's make a night of it.

814
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,556
l'd love it, Georgie. What'll we do?

815
00:41:57,724 --> 00:41:59,516
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes

816
00:41:59,601 --> 00:42:02,060
-and walk through the grass. -Huh?

817
00:42:02,145 --> 00:42:05,022
Then we can go up to the falls. lt's beautiful up there in the moonlight,

818
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:09,318
and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it.

819
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,155
Then we can climb Mount Bedford and smell the pines

820
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,865
and watch the sunrise against the peaks,

821
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,408
and we'll stay up there the whole night,

822
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,744
and everybody'll be talking. There'll be a terrific scandal.

823
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:22,623
Georgie, have you gone crazy? Why, walk in the grass in my bare feet?

824
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:25,709
Why it's 1 0 miles up to Mount Bedford.

825
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:30,172
-lf you think... -Okay, just forget about the whole thing.

826
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,235
-What are you doing, picketing? -Hello, Mary.

827
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,404
l just happened to be passing by here.

828
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,323
Yes, so l noticed.

829
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,243
-Have you made up your mind? -How's that?

830
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,954
-Have you made up your mind? -About what?

831
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:03,413
About coming in.

832
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,083
Your motherjust phoned and said you were on your way over

833
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,919
-to pay me a visit. -My motherjust called you?

834
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,420
Well, how did she know?

835
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:12,464
-Didn't you tell her? -l didn't tell anybody.

836
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,384
l just went for a walk and happened to be passing by here.

837
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,010
What do you...

838
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,681
Went for a walk. That's all.

839
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,935
-l'll be downstairs, Mother. -All right, dear.

840
00:43:46,791 --> 00:43:49,084
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?

841
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,670
Well, l'll come in for a minute.

842
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,090
But l...

843
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:10,272
l didn't tell anybody l was coming over here, you know.

844
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,568
-When did you get back? -Tuesday.

845
00:44:15,737 --> 00:44:17,612
Where did you get that dress?

846
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:20,240
-Do you like it? -lt's all right.

847
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,496
l thought you would go back to New York,

848
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,957
like Sam and Angie and the rest of them.

849
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:33,962
l worked there a couple of vacations, but l don't know.

850
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:35,422
l guess l was homesick.

851
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,508
Homesick? For Bedford Falls?

852
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,762
Yes, and my family and...

853
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,181
Everything.

854
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,184
Would you like to sit down?

855
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:49,102
All right, for a minute.

856
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:51,855
l still can't understand it, though.

857
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,107
You know, l didn't tell anybody l was coming here.

858
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,525
Would you rather leave?

859
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,486
No. l don't want to be rude.

860
00:44:57,570 --> 00:44:59,112
Well, then, sit down.

861
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,489
What's that?

862
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,077
Some joke, huh?

863
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,375
Well...

864
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,629
l see it still smells like pine needles around here.

865
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:17,464
Thank you.

866
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:26,473
And dance by the

867
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,350
What's the matter?

868
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,269
Oh. Oh, yeah, yeah.

869
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,273
Well...

870
00:45:35,358 --> 00:45:37,734
Nice about your brother Harry and Ruth, isn't it?

871
00:45:37,819 --> 00:45:39,903
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's all right.

872
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:41,321
Don't you like her?

873
00:45:41,406 --> 00:45:43,865
Well, of course l like her. She's a peach.

874
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:48,954
Oh, just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?

875
00:45:49,038 --> 00:45:53,583
No. Marriage is all right for Harry and Marty and Sam and you.

876
00:45:53,668 --> 00:45:55,377
Mary! Mary!

877
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,837
Who's down there with you?

878
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:58,797
lt's George Bailey, Mother.

879
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,591
George Bailey? What's he want?

880
00:46:01,843 --> 00:46:03,176
l don't know.

881
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,011
What do you want?

882
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:08,515
Me? Not a thing.

883
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,642
l just came in to get warm.

884
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,772
He's making violent love to me, Mother.

885
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:19,568
You tell him to go right back home, and don't you leave the house, either!

886
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:22,779
Sam Wainwright promised to call you from New York tonight.

887
00:46:22,864 --> 00:46:25,866
What's your mother mean? You know, l didn't come here to...

888
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,452
-What did you come here for, then? -l don't know. You tell me.

889
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:31,163
You're supposed to be the one that has all the answers. You tell me.

890
00:46:31,247 --> 00:46:33,123
-Why don't you go home? -That's where l'm going.

891
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,833
l don't know why l came here in the first place.

892
00:46:34,917 --> 00:46:36,376
-Good night. -Good night!

893
00:46:36,461 --> 00:46:39,463
Mary! Mary! The telephone. lt's Sam.

894
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,797
l'll get it.

895
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,675
Whatever were you doing that you couldn't hear?

896
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,020
Mary, he's waiting.

897
00:46:58,441 --> 00:46:59,566
Hello?

898
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,861
Forgot my hat.

899
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:08,074
Hee-haw! Hello, Sam, how are you?

900
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:11,203
I'm great. Gee, it's good to hear your voice again.

901
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:14,080
Well, that's awfully sweet of you, Sam.

902
00:47:15,041 --> 00:47:18,335
There's an old friend of yours here. George Bailey.

903
00:47:18,419 --> 00:47:20,337
You mean old mossback George?

904
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:23,006
Yes, old mossback George.

905
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,050
Hee-haw! Put him on.

906
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:27,427
Wait just a minute. l'll call him. George!

907
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:29,679
He doesn't want to speak to George, you idiot.

908
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:31,640
He does so. He asked for him.

909
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,185
George, Sam wants to speak to you.

910
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:40,607
Hi, Sam.

911
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:44,528
Well, George Baileyoffski! Hey, a fine pal you are.

912
00:47:44,612 --> 00:47:46,446
What're you trying to do, steal my girl?

913
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:47,531
What do you mean?

914
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,407
Nobody's trying to steal anybody's girl.

915
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:51,409
Here... Here's Mary.

916
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,870
No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. I want to taIk to both of you.

917
00:47:53,955 --> 00:47:55,413
TeII Mary to get on the extension.

918
00:47:55,498 --> 00:47:58,792
-Mother's on the extension. We... -l am not!

919
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:00,961
We can both hear. Come here.

920
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,713
We're listening, Sam.

921
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:07,384
WeII, Iook, I have a big deaI coming up that's gonna make us aII rich.

922
00:48:07,468 --> 00:48:10,053
George, do you remember that night in Martini's bar

923
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,807
when you toId me you'd read somepIace about making pIastics out of soybeans?

924
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:16,059
-Chili beans. -Shut up, will you?

925
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,812
You remember, out of chili... Out of soybeans.

926
00:48:20,690 --> 00:48:23,108
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Soybeans, yeah.

927
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,527
WeII, Iisten, Dad snapped up the idea,

928
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:28,113
and he's gonna buiId a factory outside of Rochester.

929
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:29,739
How do you Iike that?

930
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,661
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?

931
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,497
WeII, why not? Can you think of anything better?

932
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:41,209
Well, l don't know. Just why not right here?

933
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:45,005
You remember that old tool and machinery works?

934
00:48:45,089 --> 00:48:47,090
You tell your father he can get that for a song.

935
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,466
And all the labor he wants, too.

936
00:48:48,551 --> 00:48:51,011
Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.

937
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:53,388
That so? Well, l'll tell him.

938
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,806
Hey, that sounds great.

939
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:56,766
Oh, baby, l knew you'd come through.

940
00:48:56,851 --> 00:48:59,894
Now here's the point, Mary. Mary, you're in on this, too.

941
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:02,397
Now Iisten. Have you got any money?

942
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,110
Money? Yeah... Well, a little.

943
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,153
Well, now, listen.

944
00:49:08,237 --> 00:49:11,448
I want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, do you hear?

945
00:49:11,532 --> 00:49:14,242
And, George, l may have a job for you,

946
00:49:14,327 --> 00:49:18,288
that is unIess you're stiII married to that broken-down BuiIding and Loan.

947
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:20,582
WeII, this is the biggest thing since radio,

948
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,792
and I'm Ietting you in on the ground floor.

949
00:49:22,877 --> 00:49:24,919
Oh, Mary. Mary?

950
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:28,840
l'm here.

951
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,176
WouId you teII that guy

952
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:33,303
I'm giving him the chance of a Iifetime, do you hear?

953
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,263
The chance of a lifetime!

954
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:41,186
He says it's the chance of a lifetime.

955
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:46,232
Now you listen to me.

956
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:49,444
l don't want any plastics, and l don't want any ground floors.

957
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:51,488
And l don't want to get married, ever, to anyone.

958
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:52,989
You understand that?

959
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,991
l want to do what l want to do.

960
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:58,161
And you're... And you're...

961
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,748
-Oh, Mary, Mary. -George, George, George.

962
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:05,752
Oh, Mary.

963
00:50:07,296 --> 00:50:10,882
Oh, dear. Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

964
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:13,718
Mary...

965
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,097
Here they come! Here they come!

966
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,289
Goodbye, George!

967
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,961
Goodbye!

968
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:57,929
First Harry, now George.

969
00:50:58,013 --> 00:51:00,223
Annie, we're just two old maids now.

970
00:51:00,307 --> 00:51:02,434
You speak for yourself, Miss B.

971
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,481
lf either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.

972
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:13,111
Hey, look. There's somebody driving this cab.

973
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,029
Bert the cop sent this over.

974
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:17,490
He said to float away to Happyland on the bubbles.

975
00:51:17,575 --> 00:51:19,743
Oh, look at this. Old Bert. Champagne!

976
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,037
By the way, where are you two going on this here now honeymoon?

977
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:25,248
Where are we going? Look at this.

978
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,709
There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.

979
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,878
l feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look.

980
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:32,338
You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna shoot the works.

981
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:34,674
A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda.

982
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:37,218
The highest hotels, the oldest champagne,

983
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:41,806
the richest caviar, the hottest music and the prettiest wife.

984
00:51:41,891 --> 00:51:44,142
That does it! Then what?

985
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:47,228
-Then what, honey? -After that, who cares?

986
00:51:47,688 --> 00:51:49,689
That does it, come here. Come here.

987
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:54,402
Don't look now, but there's something funny

988
00:51:54,487 --> 00:51:56,696
going on over there at the bank, George.

989
00:51:56,781 --> 00:52:00,825
l've never really seen one, but that's got all the earmarks of being a run.

990
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:11,294
Hey, Ernie, if you got any money in the bank, you better hurry.

991
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,129
George, let's not stop. Let's go!

992
00:52:13,214 --> 00:52:14,714
Just a minute, dear.

993
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:21,304
-Please, let's not stop, George. -l'll be back in a minute, Mary.

994
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:40,365
Well, hello, everybody. Mrs. Thompson, how are you?

995
00:52:40,449 --> 00:52:43,284
Charlie? What's the matter here, can't you get in?

996
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,887
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?

997
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,305
George.

998
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:09,018
Come on in, everybody. That's right. Just come on in.

999
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,520
Look out, you.

1000
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,357
Now, look, why don't you all sit down?

1001
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:16,609
There are a lot of seats over there.

1002
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:19,487
Just make yourselves at home.

1003
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,491
George, can l see you a minute?

1004
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:26,327
-Why didn't you call me? -l just did, but they said you left.

1005
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,996
This is a pickle, George. This is a pickle.

1006
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,622
All right, now, what happened? How did it start?

1007
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:30,832
How does a thing like this ever start?

1008
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:32,584
-All l know is the bank called our loan. -When?

1009
00:53:32,668 --> 00:53:34,878
About an hour ago. l handed over all our cash.

1010
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,296
-All of it? -Every cent of it,

1011
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,756
-and still it was less than we owe them. -Holy mackerel!

1012
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:40,967
And then l got scared, George, and closed the doors.

1013
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,719
l... l...

1014
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,514
The whole town's gone crazy.

1015
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:47,932
Yeah, hello?

1016
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:50,143
George, it's Potter.

1017
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:54,772
Hello?

1018
00:53:54,857 --> 00:53:59,235
George, there is a rumor around town that you've closed your doors.

1019
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,778
ls that true?

1020
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:03,406
Oh, well, l'm very glad to hear that.

1021
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:06,826
George, are you all right? Do you need any police?

1022
00:54:06,911 --> 00:54:08,286
Police? What for?

1023
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:12,332
Well, mobs get pretty ugly sometimes, you know.

1024
00:54:12,625 --> 00:54:17,128
George, l'm going all out to help in this crisis.

1025
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:22,383
l've just guaranteed the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs.

1026
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,095
They'll close up for a week and then reopen.

1027
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,765
He just took over the bank.

1028
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:30,642
l may lose a fortune,

1029
00:54:30,726 --> 00:54:34,604
but l'm willing to guarantee your people, too.

1030
00:54:34,688 --> 00:54:37,148
Just tell them to bring their shares over here,

1031
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,817
and l will pay 50 cents on the dollar.

1032
00:54:39,902 --> 00:54:42,028
You never miss a trick, do you, Potter?

1033
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,279
Well, you're gonna miss this one.

1034
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:47,075
lf you close your doors before 6:00 p.m., you will never reopen.

1035
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,335
George, was it a nice wedding?

1036
00:54:57,419 --> 00:54:59,420
Gosh, l wanted to be there.

1037
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:00,880
Yeah.

1038
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,717
You can take this one off now.

1039
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:18,898
Now, just remember that this thing isn't as black as it appeared.

1040
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,493
l have some news for you, folks.

1041
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:31,995
l was just talking to old man Potter,

1042
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,705
and he's guaranteed cash payments at the bank.

1043
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,331
The bank's gonna reopen next week.

1044
00:55:35,416 --> 00:55:37,333
But, George, l got my money here.

1045
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,002
Did he guarantee this place?

1046
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:42,130
Well, no, Charlie. l didn't even ask him. We don't need Potter over here.

1047
00:55:42,214 --> 00:55:43,923
Then, l'll take mine now.

1048
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,925
No, but you're...

1049
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,845
You're thinking of this place all wrong,

1050
00:55:48,929 --> 00:55:52,515
as if l had the money back in a safe. The money's not here.

1051
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:55,143
Well, your money's in Joe's house. That's right next to yours.

1052
00:55:55,227 --> 00:55:57,478
And in the Kennedy house and Mrs. Macklin's house

1053
00:55:57,563 --> 00:55:59,063
and 1 00 others.

1054
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,732
Why, you're lending them the money to build,

1055
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,859
and then, they're gonna pay it back to you as best they can.

1056
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,610
Now, what are you gonna do, foreclose on them?

1057
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:10,742
l got $242 in here, and $242 isn't going to break anybody.

1058
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:14,203
Okay, Tom. All right.

1059
00:56:14,455 --> 00:56:17,040
Here you are. You sign this. You'll get your money in 60 days.

1060
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:18,249
Sixty days?

1061
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,376
Now, that's what you agreed to when you bought your shares.

1062
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,587
-Tom! Tom, did you get your money? -No.

1063
00:56:22,671 --> 00:56:23,713
Well, l did.

1064
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:26,424
Old man Potter'll pay 50 cents on the dollar for every share you've got.

1065
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:29,093
-Fifty cents on the dollar! -Yes, cash!

1066
00:56:29,178 --> 00:56:30,762
Well, what do you say?

1067
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:33,473
Now, Tom, you have to stick to your original agreement.

1068
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:34,891
Now, give us 60 days on this.

1069
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,060
-Okay, Randall. -Are you going to go to Potter's?

1070
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,228
Better to get half than nothing.

1071
00:56:39,313 --> 00:56:41,397
Tom! Tom!

1072
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,649
Randall! Now, Randall, wait! Wait.

1073
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:47,820
Now, listen. Now, listen to me. l beg of you not to do this thing.

1074
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49,989
lf Potter gets a hold of this Building and Loan,

1075
00:56:50,074 --> 00:56:52,033
there'll never be another decent house built in this town.

1076
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,618
He's already got charge of the bank.

1077
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,745
He's got the bus line. He got the department stores.

1078
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,581
And now he's after us. Why? Well, it's very simple.

1079
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,917
Because we're cutting in on his business, that's why.

1080
00:57:01,001 --> 00:57:03,086
And because he wants to keep you living in his slums

1081
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,088
and paying the kind of rent he decides.

1082
00:57:05,172 --> 00:57:07,090
Joe, you had one of those Potter houses, didn't you?

1083
00:57:07,174 --> 00:57:08,174
Well, have you forgotten?

1084
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:10,635
Have you forgotten what he charged you for that broken-down shack?

1085
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:13,846
Here, Ed, you know. You remember last year when things weren't going so well

1086
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:15,098
and you couldn't make your payments.

1087
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,641
Well, you didn't lose your house, did you?

1088
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:18,476
You think Potter would've let you keep it?

1089
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,270
Can't you understand what's happening here?

1090
00:57:21,355 --> 00:57:22,939
Don't you see what's happening?

1091
00:57:23,023 --> 00:57:25,733
Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying, and why?

1092
00:57:25,818 --> 00:57:27,985
Because we're panicky and he's not. That's why.

1093
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:29,278
He's picking up some bargain.

1094
00:57:29,363 --> 00:57:31,739
Now we can get through this thing all right.

1095
00:57:31,824 --> 00:57:33,616
We've got to stick together, though.

1096
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,201
We've got to have faith in each other.

1097
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,496
But my husband hasn't worked in over a year, and l need money.

1098
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,289
How am going to live until the bank opens?

1099
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:42,708
-l got doctor bills to pay. -l need cash.

1100
00:57:42,793 --> 00:57:44,710
l can't feed my kids on faith.

1101
00:57:44,795 --> 00:57:46,462
How much do you need?

1102
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:50,049
Hey! l got $2,000.

1103
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:53,136
Here's $2,000. This'll tide us over till the bank reopens.

1104
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:56,013
-All right, Tom, how much do you need? -$242.

1105
00:57:56,098 --> 00:57:58,641
Tom, just enough to tide you over until the bank reopens.

1106
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,893
l'll take $242.

1107
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,481
-There you are. -That'll close my account.

1108
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:07,859
Your account's still here. That's a loan.

1109
00:58:07,943 --> 00:58:11,320
-Okay. All right, Ed? -l got $300 here, George.

1110
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:14,991
Now, Ed, what'll it take till the bank opens? What do you need?

1111
00:58:15,075 --> 00:58:17,410
Well, l suppose $20.

1112
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:20,329
$20. Now you're talking. Thanks, Ed. That's fine.

1113
00:58:20,414 --> 00:58:21,998
All right, now, Mrs. Thompson, how much do you want?

1114
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:23,374
But it's your own money, George.

1115
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,168
Never mind about that. How much do you want?

1116
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,336
-l can get along with $20, all right. -$20, fine.

1117
00:58:27,421 --> 00:58:29,547
-And l'll sign the paper. -You don't have to sign anything.

1118
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:31,757
l know you. You pay it when you can. That's okay.

1119
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:35,261
-All right, Mrs. Davis? -Could l have $1 7.50?

1120
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:40,474
Bless your heart. Of course you can have it. You got 50 cents?

1121
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:41,934
-Seven... -We're gonna make it, George.

1122
00:58:43,604 --> 00:58:48,107
...five, four, three, two,

1123
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,359
one, bingo!

1124
00:58:50,444 --> 00:58:52,069
We made it! Close the door, Eustace! We made it.

1125
00:58:52,154 --> 00:58:55,072
Look, look, we're still in business. We've still got 2 bucks left.

1126
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:56,991
Look, let's have some of that. Let's celebrate!

1127
00:58:57,075 --> 00:58:58,492
Get some glasses, Tilly.

1128
00:58:58,577 --> 00:59:01,829
-Well, a couple of financial wizards. -Call us Rockefellers.

1129
00:59:01,914 --> 00:59:04,415
Get a tray for these two great big important simoleons here.

1130
00:59:04,499 --> 00:59:06,042
We'll save them for seed. A toast.

1131
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:09,587
A toast. A toast to Mama Dollar and to Papa Dollar,

1132
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:11,797
and if you want to keep this old Building and Loan in business,

1133
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,382
you better have a family real quick.

1134
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,302
-l wish they were rabbits. -l wish they were, too.

1135
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,430
Okay, let's put them in the safe and see what happens.

1136
00:59:26,855 --> 00:59:28,022
Close the door.

1137
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,024
Folks, folks, wedding cigars.

1138
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:33,527
Wedding. Holy mackerel, l'm married.

1139
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:36,239
Where's Mary? Mary! Poor...

1140
00:59:36,323 --> 00:59:38,491
Look, l got a train to catch. Well, the train's gone.

1141
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,952
l wonder if Ernie's still here with his taxicab.

1142
00:59:41,036 --> 00:59:43,454
George, there's a call for you.

1143
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,872
Look, will you get my wife on the phone?

1144
00:59:44,957 --> 00:59:46,332
She's probably over at her mother's.

1145
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,959
Mrs. Bailey is on the phone.

1146
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:50,086
l don't want Mrs. Bailey. l want my wife.

1147
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:53,714
Mrs. Bailey! Oh, that's my wife. Here, l'll take it in here.

1148
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:57,176
Mary. Hello. Listen, dear, l'm sorry.

1149
00:59:57,594 --> 01:00:01,305
Huh? Come home? What home?

1150
01:00:02,057 --> 01:00:05,810
320 Sycamore? Well, what... Whose home is that?

1151
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,854
The Waldorf Hotel, huh?

1152
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:22,451
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.

1153
01:00:22,536 --> 01:00:24,537
How would you like to get a ticket next week?

1154
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:25,955
You got any romance in you?

1155
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,624
-Sure, l had it, but l got rid of it. -Liver pills.

1156
01:00:28,709 --> 01:00:31,210
Who wants to see liver pills on their honeymoon?

1157
01:00:31,295 --> 01:00:33,713
What we want is romantic places, beautiful places,

1158
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:35,631
places George wants to go.

1159
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,718
Hey, Bert. Here he comes.

1160
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,052
Come on, we got to get this up. He's coming.

1161
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,013
-Who? -The groom, idiot.

1162
01:00:42,097 --> 01:00:43,973
This is their honeymoon. Come on. Get that ladder.

1163
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,599
What are they, ducks?

1164
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:50,646
-Get that ladder up here. -All right, all right.

1165
01:00:50,731 --> 01:00:53,566
-Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. -l'm hurrying.

1166
01:01:02,617 --> 01:01:05,286
Hiya... Good evening, sir.

1167
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,207
Welcome home, Mr. Bailey.

1168
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,755
Well, l'll be...

1169
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,638
Mary. Mary, where did you...

1170
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,411
Oh, Mary.

1171
01:03:13,081 --> 01:03:16,333
Remember the night we broke some windows in this old house?

1172
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,795
This is what l wished for.

1173
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:30,639
You're wonderful.

1174
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:53,746
-Martini, you rented a new house? -Rent?

1175
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,458
-You hear what he say, Mr. Bailey? -What's that?

1176
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,251
l own the house.

1177
01:03:59,461 --> 01:04:02,838
Me, Giuseppe Martini, l own my own house.

1178
01:04:02,923 --> 01:04:06,258
No more we live like a pigs in this Potter's Field.

1179
01:04:06,343 --> 01:04:09,428
-Mary, Mary! -Mary, come on, bring the baby.

1180
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:11,889
l feel like a queen.

1181
01:04:11,973 --> 01:04:15,059
-l'll take the kids in the car. -Oh, thank you, Mr. Bailey. Thank you.

1182
01:04:15,143 --> 01:04:18,062
All right, kids, here. Here, get in here.

1183
01:04:18,146 --> 01:04:20,314
Now, one at a time. Get right up on the seat there.

1184
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:25,528
-Sit down, there. -Here, now, get the dog, now. That's it.

1185
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:28,948
-Goat, too. -Everybody!

1186
01:04:29,241 --> 01:04:30,616
All in!

1187
01:04:32,786 --> 01:04:34,703
Bye-bye! Bye-bye!

1188
01:04:37,374 --> 01:04:38,499
All in?

1189
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,937
Mr. and Mrs. Martini, welcome home.

1190
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:02,982
Good old George, he's always making a speech.

1191
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,359
Hee-haw!

1192
01:05:05,569 --> 01:05:09,196
-Sam Wainwright. -Oh, who cares.

1193
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,908
Bread. That this house may never know hunger.

1194
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:16,996
Salt. That life may always have flavor.

1195
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,874
And wine. That joy and prosperity may reign forever.

1196
01:05:20,959 --> 01:05:22,710
Enter the Martini castle.

1197
01:05:24,546 --> 01:05:27,006
Look, Mr. Potter, it's no skin off my nose.

1198
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,924
l'm just your little rent collector.

1199
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:31,802
But you can't laugh off this Bailey Park anymore.

1200
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:33,012
Look at it.

1201
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:35,931
Congressman Black is here to see you, sir.

1202
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,976
Oh, tell the Congressman to wait. Go on.

1203
01:05:39,060 --> 01:05:41,854
Fifteen years ago, a half a dozen houses stuck here and there.

1204
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,189
There's the old cemetery, squirrels, buttercups, daisies.

1205
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,483
l used to hunt rabbits there myself.

1206
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:48,694
Look at it today.

1207
01:05:48,820 --> 01:05:51,655
Dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw,

1208
01:05:51,823 --> 01:05:55,034
90% owned by suckers who used to pay rent to you.

1209
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:58,454
Your Potter's Field, my dear Mr. Employer, is becoming just that.

1210
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:01,957
And are the local yokels making with those David and Goliath wisecracks.

1211
01:06:02,042 --> 01:06:03,792
Oh, they are, are they?

1212
01:06:03,877 --> 01:06:06,795
Even though they know the Baileys never made a dime out of it.

1213
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,381
You know very well why. The Baileys were all chumps.

1214
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:11,425
Every one of these homes is worth

1215
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:13,636
twice what it cost the Building and Loan to build.

1216
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,138
-lf l were you, Mr. Potter... -You are not me.

1217
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,725
As l say, it's no skin off my nose,

1218
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:24,813
but one of these days this bright young man

1219
01:06:24,898 --> 01:06:27,524
is gonna be asking George Bailey for a job.

1220
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:33,030
The Bailey family has been a boil on my neck long enough.

1221
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:35,240
-Yes, sir? -Come in here.

1222
01:06:35,575 --> 01:06:37,743
We just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory,

1223
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,828
and then we're gonna drive on down to Florida.

1224
01:06:39,913 --> 01:06:41,538
Why don't you have your friends join us?

1225
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:45,042
Why, sure. Hey, why don't you kids drive down with us, huh?

1226
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:48,170
Oh, l'm afraid l couldn't get away, Sam.

1227
01:06:48,254 --> 01:06:50,339
Still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh?

1228
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:54,009
Jane, l offered to let George in on the ground floor in plastics,

1229
01:06:54,094 --> 01:06:55,260
and he turned me down cold.

1230
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:58,138
-Oh, now, don't rub it in. -l'm not rubbing it in.

1231
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,848
Well, l guess we better run along.

1232
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,975
-Awfully happy to have met you, Mary. -Nice meeting you, too.

1233
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,435
-Goodbye. Glad to see you. -Goodbye, George.

1234
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:04,978
So long, George. See you in the funny papers.

1235
01:07:05,063 --> 01:07:07,147
-So long, Mary. -Bye, Sam. Have fun.

1236
01:07:07,232 --> 01:07:09,233
-Thanks for dropping around. -Florida!

1237
01:07:09,317 --> 01:07:11,026
-Hee-haw! -Hee-haw.

1238
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,640
Thank you, sir.

1239
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,184
-That's quite a cigar, Mr. Potter. -You like it?

1240
01:07:44,269 --> 01:07:45,811
l'll send you a box.

1241
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:55,946
Well, l...

1242
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:58,991
l suppose l'll find out sooner or later,

1243
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,952
but just what exactly did you want to see me about?

1244
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,666
George, now that's just what l like so much about you.

1245
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:11,795
George, l am an old man, and most people hate me.

1246
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,882
But l don't like them, either, so that makes it all even.

1247
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,134
You knowjust as well as l do

1248
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,762
that l run practically everything in this town

1249
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:22,431
but the Bailey Building and Loan.

1250
01:08:22,891 --> 01:08:26,977
You know, also, that for a number of years l've been trying to get control of it.

1251
01:08:27,061 --> 01:08:29,688
Or kill it. But l haven't been able to do it.

1252
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:31,857
You have been stopping me.

1253
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:36,111
ln fact, you have beaten me, George,

1254
01:08:36,196 --> 01:08:40,699
and as anyone in this county can tell you, that takes some doing.

1255
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,495
Take during the Depression, for instance.

1256
01:08:44,579 --> 01:08:47,664
You and l were the only ones that kept our heads.

1257
01:08:47,749 --> 01:08:51,710
You saved the Building and Loan. l saved all the rest.

1258
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:54,463
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.

1259
01:08:54,547 --> 01:08:57,841
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers.

1260
01:08:58,802 --> 01:09:02,888
Now, l have stated my side very frankly.

1261
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,390
Now let's look at your side.

1262
01:09:06,309 --> 01:09:13,232
Young man, 27-28, married, making, say, $40 a week.

1263
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:15,275
-$45. -$45.

1264
01:09:15,360 --> 01:09:16,485
$45.

1265
01:09:16,861 --> 01:09:20,739
Out of which, after supporting your mother and paying your bills,

1266
01:09:20,824 --> 01:09:23,909
you're able to keep, say, $1 0, if you skimp.

1267
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:28,330
A child or two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the $1 0.

1268
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:33,961
Now, if this young man of 28 was a common, ordinary yokel,

1269
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:35,629
l'd say he was doing fine.

1270
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:40,008
But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel.

1271
01:09:40,093 --> 01:09:43,762
He is an intelligent, smart, ambitious young man,

1272
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:47,057
who hates his job, who hates the Building and Loan

1273
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:48,809
almost as much as l do.

1274
01:09:49,519 --> 01:09:54,106
A young man who's been dying to get out on his own ever since he was born.

1275
01:09:54,524 --> 01:09:57,359
A young man... The smartest one of the crowd, mind you.

1276
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,027
A young man who has to sit by

1277
01:09:59,112 --> 01:10:02,573
and watch his friends go places because he's trapped.

1278
01:10:02,657 --> 01:10:06,326
Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life away,

1279
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:08,996
playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic eaters.

1280
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:13,792
Do l paint a correct picture, or do l exaggerate?

1281
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:18,797
-Now, what's your point, Mr. Potter? -My point?

1282
01:10:18,882 --> 01:10:21,466
-My point is l want to hire you. -Hire me?

1283
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:24,803
Yeah, l want you to manage my affairs, run my properties.

1284
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:30,142
George, l'll start you out at $20,000 a year.

1285
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:36,940
$20,000 a year?

1286
01:10:37,025 --> 01:10:40,402
You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town,

1287
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:43,196
buying your wife a lot of fine clothes,

1288
01:10:43,281 --> 01:10:46,074
a couple of business trips to New York a year,

1289
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:47,993
maybe once in a while Europe.

1290
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,411
You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?

1291
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:50,829
Would l?

1292
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,168
You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you?

1293
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,961
You know, this is me. You remember me?

1294
01:10:58,046 --> 01:10:59,838
-George Bailey. -George Bailey.

1295
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:03,008
Yeah, George Bailey, whose ship has just come in.

1296
01:11:04,302 --> 01:11:07,512
Provided he has enough brains to climb aboard.

1297
01:11:15,855 --> 01:11:17,272
Holy mackerel.

1298
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:22,903
Well, how about the Building and Loan?

1299
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,406
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success?

1300
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:31,453
l'm offering you a three-years contract at $20,000 a year, starting today.

1301
01:11:31,537 --> 01:11:33,246
ls it a deal, or isn't it?

1302
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,541
Well, Mr. Potter, l...

1303
01:11:36,751 --> 01:11:40,545
l know l ought to jump at the chance but l... l just...

1304
01:11:41,673 --> 01:11:45,717
l wonder if it would be possible for you to give me 24 hours to think it over?

1305
01:11:45,802 --> 01:11:47,469
Sure, sure, sure.

1306
01:11:47,553 --> 01:11:50,138
You go on home and talk about it to your wife.

1307
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,765
l'd like to do that.

1308
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:54,184
Yeah. ln the meantime, l'll draw up the papers.

1309
01:11:54,268 --> 01:11:56,186
-All right, sir. -Okay, George?

1310
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,231
Okay, Mr. Potter.

1311
01:12:07,407 --> 01:12:11,702
No. No. No, no, now wait a minute, here.

1312
01:12:12,578 --> 01:12:15,414
l don't need 24 hours. l don't have to talk to anybody.

1313
01:12:15,498 --> 01:12:19,251
l know right now, and the answer is no. No, doggone it!

1314
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:21,795
You sit around here, and you spin your little webs,

1315
01:12:21,879 --> 01:12:24,339
and you think the whole world revolves around you and your money.

1316
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,008
Well, it doesn't, Mr. Potter.

1317
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:29,261
ln the whole vast configuration of things,

1318
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,139
l'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider.

1319
01:12:32,223 --> 01:12:33,223
You...

1320
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,810
And that goes for you, too!

1321
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:42,983
And it goes for you, too!

1322
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,993
You wouIdn't mind Iiving in the nicest house in town,

1323
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:56,038
buying your wife a Iot of fine cIothes,

1324
01:12:56,289 --> 01:12:59,791
going to New York on a business trip a coupIe of times a year,

1325
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,127
maybe Europe once in a whiIe.

1326
01:13:03,087 --> 01:13:05,213
I know what I'm gonna do tomorrow

1327
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:08,508
and the next day and next year and the year after that.

1328
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:11,720
I'm shaking the dust of this crummy IittIe town off my feet,

1329
01:13:11,804 --> 01:13:13,638
and I'm gonna see the world.

1330
01:13:13,723 --> 01:13:16,475
And then I'm gonna buiId things. I'm gonna buiId air fieIds.

1331
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:19,144
I'm gonna buiId skyscrapers 100 stories high.

1332
01:13:19,228 --> 01:13:21,646
I'm gonna buiId a bridge a miIe Iong.

1333
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:26,068
What is it you want, Mary? What, you want the moon?

1334
01:13:26,652 --> 01:13:29,071
If you do, just say the word, l'll throw a lasso around it

1335
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:30,906
and puII her down for you.

1336
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:33,617
BuffaIo gaI Won't you come out tonight?

1337
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:36,578
Won't you come out tonight? Won't you come out tonight?

1338
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,623
BuffaIo gaI Won't you come out tonight

1339
01:13:39,707 --> 01:13:41,416
And

1340
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,800
-Hi. -Hi.

1341
01:13:55,264 --> 01:13:56,556
Mary Hatch,

1342
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:01,853
why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?

1343
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:05,524
To keep from being an old maid.

1344
01:14:05,983 --> 01:14:07,442
You could have married Sam Wainwright

1345
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:09,236
and anybody else in town.

1346
01:14:09,612 --> 01:14:12,322
l didn't want to marry anybody else in town.

1347
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,367
l want my baby to look like you.

1348
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,536
You didn't even have a honeymoon.

1349
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,995
l promised you...

1350
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:22,124
-Your what? -My baby.

1351
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,378
Your... Your...

1352
01:14:27,255 --> 01:14:28,964
Mary, you on the nest?

1353
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:33,135
-George Bailey lassoes stork. -Lassoes a stork!

1354
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:41,059
You mean you... What is it, a boy or a girl?

1355
01:14:44,689 --> 01:14:49,192
Now, you've probabIy aIready guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.

1356
01:14:49,277 --> 01:14:53,029
-No! -Mary had her baby, a boy.

1357
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,824
Then she had another one, a girl.

1358
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,118
Day after day she worked away,

1359
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,121
remaking the old Granville house into a home.

1360
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:04,916
Night after night, George came back late from the office.

1361
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,881
Potter was bearing down hard.

1362
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,721
Then came a war.

1363
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:22,100
Ma BaiIey and Mrs. Hatch joined the Red Cross and sewed.

1364
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:26,688
Mary had two more babies but still found time to run the USO.

1365
01:15:26,898 --> 01:15:30,442
Sam Wainwright made a fortune in pIastic hoods for pIanes.

1366
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:33,153
Potter became head of the draft board.

1367
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:41,328
One-A.

1368
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:44,122
Gower and Uncle Billy sold war bonds.

1369
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:48,585
Bert the cop was wounded in North Africa, got the Silver Star.

1370
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:52,422
Ernie the taxi driver parachuted into France.

1371
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,926
Marty heIped capture the Remagen Bridge.

1372
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,385
Harry...

1373
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,804
Harry BaiIey topped them aII.

1374
01:16:00,139 --> 01:16:03,808
A Navy flier, he shot down 15 pIanes,

1375
01:16:03,893 --> 01:16:08,230
two of them as they were about to crash into a transport fuII of soIdiers.

1376
01:16:09,857 --> 01:16:12,234
-Yes, but George. -George?

1377
01:16:12,485 --> 01:16:14,402
Four-F on account of his ear,

1378
01:16:14,487 --> 01:16:16,988
George fought the battle of Bedford Falls.

1379
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,824
Now, hold on! Hold on! Hold on now!

1380
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,451
Don't you know there's a war on?

1381
01:16:21,535 --> 01:16:23,328
Air raid warden.

1382
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:33,546
Paper drives.

1383
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:34,965
Scrap drives.

1384
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:36,466
Rubber drives.

1385
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:41,596
Like everybody eIse on VE Day, he wept and prayed.

1386
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,935
On VJ Day, he wept and prayed again.

1387
01:16:47,019 --> 01:16:49,437
Joseph, now show him what happened today.

1388
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:50,522
Yes, sir.

1389
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:53,942
This morning, day before Christmas, about 10:00 a.m.

1390
01:16:54,026 --> 01:16:55,610
Bedford Falls time...

1391
01:16:55,695 --> 01:16:57,988
Hey, Ernie. Look at that.

1392
01:17:03,494 --> 01:17:04,494
lt's gonna snow again.

1393
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:07,872
What do you mean, it's gonna snow? Look at the headlines. The President...

1394
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,417
l know, l know, George. That's marvelous.

1395
01:17:10,501 --> 01:17:12,002
Commander Harry Bailey!

1396
01:17:12,086 --> 01:17:14,629
Mr. Gower, look at this, the second page.

1397
01:17:14,714 --> 01:17:15,964
Now, look, this is for you.

1398
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,465
-This is for you. That's for you. -Okay.

1399
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:19,384
-Right, thanks. -See you again.

1400
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,179
Be sure you spell the name right.

1401
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:35,817
Extra! Read all about it!

1402
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:38,361
George, George! lt's Harry now on long-distance from Washington.

1403
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:39,988
Harry! What do you know about that!

1404
01:17:40,072 --> 01:17:41,573
He reversed the charges. lt's okay, isn't it?

1405
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:43,950
Reversed the charges? Of course it is for a hero.

1406
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:45,410
Harry!

1407
01:17:45,536 --> 01:17:49,581
You old seven times a son of a gun. Congratulations.

1408
01:17:49,749 --> 01:17:52,250
How's Mother standing it? She did?

1409
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:53,835
What do you know?

1410
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,628
Mother had lunch with the President's wife.

1411
01:17:55,713 --> 01:17:56,796
Wait till Martha hears about this.

1412
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:59,007
-What did they have to eat? -What'd they have to eat?

1413
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,133
Harry,

1414
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:03,345
you should see what they're cooking up in the town for you.

1415
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:04,512
Oh, they are?

1416
01:18:04,597 --> 01:18:06,473
The Navy's gonna fly Mother home this afternoon.

1417
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:07,682
ln a plane?

1418
01:18:08,059 --> 01:18:10,185
What? Uncle Billy?

1419
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,645
-Has Uncle Billy come in yet? -He stopped at the bank first.

1420
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:16,191
He's not here right now, Harry. But look, now, tell me about it.

1421
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,317
-George. George, George. -What?

1422
01:18:17,401 --> 01:18:18,526
-That man is here again. -What man?

1423
01:18:18,611 --> 01:18:20,195
Bank examiner.

1424
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:23,406
Harry, talk to Eustace for a minute, will you?

1425
01:18:23,491 --> 01:18:24,699
l'll be right back.

1426
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,242
-Well... -Harry.

1427
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:28,828
-Good morning, sir. -Carter, bank examiner.

1428
01:18:28,913 --> 01:18:31,039
-Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas.

1429
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:32,874
We're all excited around here.

1430
01:18:32,958 --> 01:18:35,043
My brotherjust got the Congressional Medal of Honor.

1431
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:37,879
-The President just decorated him. -Well, l guess they do those things.

1432
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:40,799
-Well, l trust you had a good year. -Good year?

1433
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:44,135
Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.

1434
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:46,012
Yeah, very funny.

1435
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:50,975
Well, now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.

1436
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,311
Although l shouldn't wonder when you okay reverse charges

1437
01:18:53,396 --> 01:18:55,146
on personal long-distance calls.

1438
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,815
-George, shall we hang up? -No, no.

1439
01:18:56,899 --> 01:18:58,566
He wants to talk to Uncle Billy. You just hold on, there.

1440
01:18:58,651 --> 01:19:01,403
Now, if you'll cooperate, l'd like to finish with you by tonight.

1441
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,364
l want to spend Christmas in Elmira with my family.

1442
01:19:04,448 --> 01:19:05,698
l don't blame you at all, Mr. Carter.

1443
01:19:05,783 --> 01:19:07,325
Just step right in here. We'll fix you up.

1444
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:11,162
December 24.

1445
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,337
$8,000.

1446
01:19:20,464 --> 01:19:23,049
-Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter. -Merry Christmas.

1447
01:19:23,134 --> 01:19:26,553
Well, good morning, Mr. Potter. What's the news?

1448
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:30,390
Well, well, well, "Harry Bailey wins Congressional Medal."

1449
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:32,559
That couldn't be one of the Bailey boys.

1450
01:19:32,643 --> 01:19:36,229
You just can't keep those Baileys down, now can you, Mr. Potter?

1451
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:38,731
How does slacker George feel about that?

1452
01:19:38,816 --> 01:19:40,066
Very jealous. Very jealous.

1453
01:19:40,151 --> 01:19:42,360
He only lost three buttons off his vest.

1454
01:19:42,445 --> 01:19:44,487
Of course, slacker George would've gotten

1455
01:19:44,572 --> 01:19:46,448
two of these medals if he had gone.

1456
01:19:46,532 --> 01:19:48,074
-Bad ear. -Yes.

1457
01:19:48,242 --> 01:19:51,703
After all, Potter, some people like George had to stay at home.

1458
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:55,832
Not every heel was in Germany and Japan.

1459
01:20:03,132 --> 01:20:06,843
-Good morning, Mr. Bailey. -Good morning, Horace.

1460
01:20:07,887 --> 01:20:10,638
-l guess you forgot something. -Huh?

1461
01:20:10,723 --> 01:20:12,557
-You forgot something. -What?

1462
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,142
Well, aren't you going to make a deposit?

1463
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:15,226
Oh, sure, sure l am.

1464
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:18,730
Well, then, it's usually customary to bring the money with you.

1465
01:20:19,273 --> 01:20:23,485
Oh, shucks, l knew l had.

1466
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,405
How about that finger there?

1467
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:28,573
Well, l...

1468
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:30,658
Bailey.

1469
01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:39,584
Take me back there. Hurry up.

1470
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:43,922
Come on, look sharp.

1471
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:03,107
Take me back.

1472
01:21:12,952 --> 01:21:16,287
Just make yourself at home, Mr. Carter. l got those books for you here.

1473
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:17,789
Oh, hello, Vi.

1474
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,457
George, can l see you for a second?

1475
01:21:19,542 --> 01:21:22,418
Why, of course you can. Go on in the office there.

1476
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:25,421
Uncle Billy, talk to Harry. He's on the telephone.

1477
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:29,008
Hurry up, Uncle Billy, hurry. Long distance, Washington.

1478
01:21:29,093 --> 01:21:30,218
Hey, here's Harry on the phone.

1479
01:21:30,302 --> 01:21:32,053
You know, your nephew, remember? Harry.

1480
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:33,388
-Here he is. -Hurry up.

1481
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:37,642
Hello? Hello. Yes, Harry, yes, everything's fine.

1482
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:40,353
l ought to have my head examined.

1483
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:43,314
$8,000. lt's got to be somewhere.

1484
01:21:49,488 --> 01:21:50,738
Here you are.

1485
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,407
Character?

1486
01:21:53,033 --> 01:21:54,325
lf l had any character, l'd...

1487
01:21:54,410 --> 01:21:57,829
lt takes a lot of character to leave your hometown and start all over again.

1488
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,414
No, George, don't.

1489
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,499
Here now, you're broke, aren't you?

1490
01:22:01,584 --> 01:22:03,209
-l know, but... -What do you want to do,

1491
01:22:03,294 --> 01:22:05,086
hock your furs and that hat?

1492
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:07,922
You want to walk to New York?

1493
01:22:08,007 --> 01:22:09,799
You know, they charge for meals and rent up there,

1494
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:11,301
just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.

1495
01:22:11,385 --> 01:22:13,177
-Yeah, sure. -No, that's a loan, now.

1496
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,763
That's my business, Building and Loan.

1497
01:22:15,931 --> 01:22:18,975
Besides, you'll get a job. Good luck to you.

1498
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,227
l'm glad l know you, George Bailey.

1499
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:29,193
-Say hello to New York for me. -Yeah, yeah, sure, l will.

1500
01:22:29,278 --> 01:22:31,195
Now, let's hear from you once in a while.

1501
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:38,453
-Merry Christmas, Vi. -Merry Christmas, George.

1502
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,831
-Mr. Bailey. -Oh, Mr. Carter, l'm sorry.

1503
01:22:41,915 --> 01:22:43,416
l'll be right with you. Uncle Billy in there?

1504
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,001
Yeah, he's in his office.

1505
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,295
What's going on?

1506
01:22:47,504 --> 01:22:49,505
The bank examiner's here.

1507
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:53,217
-He's here? -Yeah. He wants the accounts payable...

1508
01:22:53,344 --> 01:22:54,927
What's the matter with you?

1509
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,429
Come here.

1510
01:23:16,700 --> 01:23:17,659
Eustace.

1511
01:23:17,743 --> 01:23:19,494
-Yeah? -Come here a minute.

1512
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:23,498
Did you see Uncle Billy with any cash last night?

1513
01:23:23,582 --> 01:23:26,084
He had it on his desk counting it before he closed up.

1514
01:23:27,252 --> 01:23:28,836
Now, look, did you buy anything?

1515
01:23:28,921 --> 01:23:31,214
-Nothing. Not even a stick of gum. -All right, all right.

1516
01:23:31,298 --> 01:23:33,925
Now, we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.

1517
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,009
-Right. This way. -Come on.

1518
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:46,938
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?

1519
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:50,149
Yeah, maybe, maybe.

1520
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:53,027
Maybe! l don't want any maybe. We've got to find that money!

1521
01:23:53,112 --> 01:23:54,654
-l'm no good to you, George. -Uncle Billy, look,

1522
01:23:54,738 --> 01:23:57,323
do you realize what's going to happen if we don't find it?

1523
01:23:57,408 --> 01:23:58,449
Listen to me.

1524
01:23:58,534 --> 01:24:00,326
Do you have any secret hiding place here in the house?

1525
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:02,453
Someplace you would have... Someplace you hide the money?

1526
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,163
l've gone over the whole house,

1527
01:24:04,248 --> 01:24:08,167
even in rooms that have been locked since l lost Laura.

1528
01:24:08,252 --> 01:24:11,379
Listen to me, listen to me! Think, think!

1529
01:24:11,463 --> 01:24:15,550
l can't think anymore, George. l can't think anymore. lt hurts.

1530
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:18,553
Where's that money, you silly, stupid old fool?

1531
01:24:18,637 --> 01:24:21,389
Where's that money? Do you realize what this means?

1532
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:24,475
lt means bankruptcy and scandal and prison!

1533
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:26,894
That's what it means.

1534
01:24:26,979 --> 01:24:30,231
One of us is going to jail. Well, it's not going to be me.

1535
01:24:53,005 --> 01:24:54,088
Hello, darling.

1536
01:24:54,173 --> 01:24:55,965
-Hello, Daddy. -Hello, Daddy.

1537
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:57,925
How do you like it?

1538
01:24:58,010 --> 01:24:59,677
-Bless you! -Bless you!

1539
01:25:01,430 --> 01:25:02,597
Did you bring the wreath?

1540
01:25:02,681 --> 01:25:04,515
Yes, Daddy, did you bring the Christmas wreath?

1541
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,600
What wreath?

1542
01:25:05,684 --> 01:25:08,144
The Merry Christmas wreath for the window.

1543
01:25:08,228 --> 01:25:09,562
No. l left it at the office.

1544
01:25:09,646 --> 01:25:11,606
-ls it snowing? -Yeah, it just started.

1545
01:25:11,690 --> 01:25:14,776
-Where's your coat and hat? -Left them at the office.

1546
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:16,027
What's the matter?

1547
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,696
Nothing's the matter. Everything's all right.

1548
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:29,665
Come on, Pete, you're a big boy. You can help me get this star up.

1549
01:25:29,750 --> 01:25:32,752
Way up at the top. There. That's it.

1550
01:25:33,378 --> 01:25:37,173
All right, fill in that little bare spot right there. Right there.

1551
01:25:39,384 --> 01:25:42,887
lsn't it wonderful about Harry? We're famous, George.

1552
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,724
Bet l had 50 calls today about the parade, the banquet.

1553
01:25:46,892 --> 01:25:48,976
Your mother's so excited. She...

1554
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:12,083
Must she keep playing that?

1555
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:15,002
l have to practice it for the party tonight, Daddy.

1556
01:26:15,087 --> 01:26:18,172
Mama said we could stay up till midnight and sing Christmas carols.

1557
01:26:18,257 --> 01:26:19,757
Can you sing, Daddy?

1558
01:26:20,133 --> 01:26:21,717
Better hurry and shave.

1559
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:24,762
-The families will be here soon. -Families.

1560
01:26:24,847 --> 01:26:27,306
l don't want the families over here.

1561
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:32,144
Come on out in the kitchen with me while l finish dinner.

1562
01:26:32,229 --> 01:26:35,314
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1563
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,567
-Have a hectic day? -Oh, yeah.

1564
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,570
Another big red-letter day for the Baileys.

1565
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:43,865
Daddy, the Browns next door have a new car. You should see it.

1566
01:26:43,949 --> 01:26:46,200
Well, what's the matter with our car? lsn't it good enough for you?

1567
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,368
Yes, Daddy.

1568
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:50,037
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1569
01:26:50,122 --> 01:26:52,373
-Excuse you for what? -l burped.

1570
01:26:53,458 --> 01:26:54,876
All right, darling, you're excused.

1571
01:26:54,960 --> 01:26:57,712
Now, go on upstairs and see if little Zuzu wants anything.

1572
01:26:58,255 --> 01:27:02,550
-Zuzu? What's the matter with Zuzu? -Oh, she's just got a cold. She's in bed.

1573
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,093
Caught it coming home from school.

1574
01:27:04,177 --> 01:27:06,721
They gave her a flower for a prize, and she didn't want to crush it,

1575
01:27:06,805 --> 01:27:08,055
so she didn't button up her coat.

1576
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,308
-What is it, a sore throat or what? -lt's just a cold.

1577
01:27:10,392 --> 01:27:11,684
-The doctor says it's nothing serious. -The doctor?

1578
01:27:11,768 --> 01:27:13,519
-Was the doctor here? -Yes, l called him right away.

1579
01:27:13,604 --> 01:27:14,854
He says it's nothing to worry about.

1580
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:16,230
ls she running a temperature? What is it?

1581
01:27:16,315 --> 01:27:18,399
Just a teensy one, 99.6. She'll be all right.

1582
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:19,942
Of course, it's this old house.

1583
01:27:20,027 --> 01:27:22,236
l don't know why we don't all have pneumonia.

1584
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:26,657
Drafty old barn. Might as well be living in a refrigerator.

1585
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:28,618
Why did we have to live here in the first place

1586
01:27:28,702 --> 01:27:31,829
and stay around this measly, crummy old town?

1587
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:35,207
-George, what's wrong? -Wrong! Everything's wrong.

1588
01:27:35,292 --> 01:27:38,586
You call this a happy family? Why do we have to have all these kids?

1589
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:42,340
-Dad, how do you spell "frankincense"? -l don't know. Ask your mother.

1590
01:27:42,424 --> 01:27:44,175
-Where're you going? -l'm going up to see Zuzu.

1591
01:27:44,259 --> 01:27:46,677
He told me to write a play for tomorrow.

1592
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:01,275
F-r-a-n-k-i-n...

1593
01:28:01,485 --> 01:28:02,860
Hi, Daddy!

1594
01:28:03,987 --> 01:28:07,198
-Well, what happened to you? -l won a flower.

1595
01:28:07,491 --> 01:28:09,325
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?

1596
01:28:09,409 --> 01:28:11,077
l want to give my flower a drink.

1597
01:28:11,161 --> 01:28:13,371
All right, all right. Now, give Daddy the flower.

1598
01:28:13,455 --> 01:28:14,789
l'll give it a drink.

1599
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,207
Now, here.

1600
01:28:17,709 --> 01:28:19,794
Look, Daddy!

1601
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:21,295
Paste it!

1602
01:28:21,380 --> 01:28:23,923
Yeah, all right, all right. Give it here.

1603
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:28,928
Now, we'll paste this together here.

1604
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,309
There. There it is. Good as new.

1605
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:37,478
Now, give the flower a drink.

1606
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:39,021
Now, will you do something for me?

1607
01:28:39,106 --> 01:28:41,857
-What? -Will you try to get some sleep?

1608
01:28:42,067 --> 01:28:44,986
l'm not sleepy. l want to look at my flower.

1609
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:49,490
l know, l know, but you just go to sleep and then you can dream about it,

1610
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,951
and it'll be a whole garden.

1611
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:53,285
lt will?

1612
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:03,504
-Telephone! -Telephone!

1613
01:29:03,588 --> 01:29:05,006
l'll get it.

1614
01:29:06,925 --> 01:29:08,092
Hello?

1615
01:29:09,011 --> 01:29:11,053
Yes, this is Mrs. Bailey.

1616
01:29:11,430 --> 01:29:14,306
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Welch. l'm sure she'll be all right.

1617
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:16,017
The doctor said that she ought to be out of bed

1618
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,309
in time to have her Christmas dinner.

1619
01:29:17,394 --> 01:29:18,936
-ls that Zuzu's teacher? -Yes.

1620
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:20,354
Let me speak to her.

1621
01:29:20,439 --> 01:29:22,898
Hello. Hello, Mrs. Welch?

1622
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,735
This is George Bailey. l'm Zuzu's father.

1623
01:29:25,819 --> 01:29:27,528
Say, what kind of a teacher are you, anyway?

1624
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:29,905
What do you mean sending her home like that, half naked?

1625
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:32,533
Do you realize she'll probably end up with pneumonia on account of you?

1626
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,577
-George! -ls this the sort of thing we pay taxes for

1627
01:29:34,661 --> 01:29:36,787
to have teachers like you?

1628
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:40,124
Stupid, silly, careless people who send our kids home without any clothes on?

1629
01:29:40,208 --> 01:29:42,043
You know, maybe my kids aren't the best-dressed kids.

1630
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,878
And maybe they don't have any decent clothes...

1631
01:29:43,962 --> 01:29:45,755
That stupid...

1632
01:29:46,465 --> 01:29:49,383
Hello, Mrs. Welch. l want to apologize...

1633
01:29:49,468 --> 01:29:51,594
Hello? Hello.

1634
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,765
-She's hung up! -l'll hang her up!

1635
01:29:55,849 --> 01:29:59,060
-Hey, you! I'II knock your bIock off! -What is that?

1636
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,936
Hello! Who's this?

1637
01:30:01,021 --> 01:30:02,563
Oh, Mr. Welch?

1638
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,398
Okay, that's fine, Mr. Welch.

1639
01:30:04,483 --> 01:30:06,567
Give me a chance to tell you what l really think of your wife.

1640
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:07,693
George, stop it.

1641
01:30:07,778 --> 01:30:09,487
Will you get out and let me handle this?

1642
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:12,114
Hello? Hello? What?

1643
01:30:13,825 --> 01:30:15,409
Oh, you will, huh?

1644
01:30:15,494 --> 01:30:18,412
Okay, Mr. Welch. Any time you think you're man enough, you...

1645
01:30:18,497 --> 01:30:19,997
Hello! Any...

1646
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,127
Dad, how do you spell "hallelujah"?

1647
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:27,254
How should l know? What do you think l am, a dictionary?

1648
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:28,589
Tommy, stop that! Stop it!

1649
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,549
Janie, haven't you learned that silly tune yet?

1650
01:30:30,634 --> 01:30:34,345
You play it over and over again. Now stop it! Stop it!

1651
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:03,082
l'm sorry, Mary.

1652
01:31:06,378 --> 01:31:08,254
Janie, l'm sorry.

1653
01:31:08,922 --> 01:31:13,092
l didn't mean that. l... You go on and practice.

1654
01:31:18,640 --> 01:31:21,016
Pete, l owe you an apology, too.

1655
01:31:22,269 --> 01:31:23,644
l'm sorry.

1656
01:31:25,063 --> 01:31:27,898
-What do you want to know? -Nothing, Daddy.

1657
01:31:34,865 --> 01:31:36,657
What's the matter with everybody?

1658
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:39,285
Janie, go on. l told you to practice. Now, go on, play!

1659
01:31:39,369 --> 01:31:40,703
Oh, Daddy!

1660
01:31:46,084 --> 01:31:49,545
George, why must you torture the children? Why don't you...

1661
01:31:50,297 --> 01:31:51,547
Mary...

1662
01:32:05,604 --> 01:32:07,521
Bedford 247, please.

1663
01:32:07,606 --> 01:32:09,648
-ls Daddy in trouble? -Yes, Pete.

1664
01:32:09,733 --> 01:32:12,818
-Shall l pray for him? -Yes, Janie, pray very hard.

1665
01:32:12,903 --> 01:32:14,945
-Me, too? -You, too, Tommy.

1666
01:32:15,947 --> 01:32:17,907
Hello? Uncle Billy?

1667
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,950
l'm in trouble, Mr. Potter.

1668
01:32:20,785 --> 01:32:22,203
l need help.

1669
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:26,165
Through some sort of an accident, my company's short in their accounts.

1670
01:32:26,249 --> 01:32:28,042
The bank examiner got there today.

1671
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:30,377
l've got to raise $8,000 immediately.

1672
01:32:30,462 --> 01:32:32,922
Oh, that's what the reporters wanted to talk to you about?

1673
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:34,340
-The reporters? -Yes.

1674
01:32:34,424 --> 01:32:37,801
They called me up from your Building and Loan.

1675
01:32:38,094 --> 01:32:41,472
Oh, there's a man over there from the D.A.'s office, too.

1676
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:42,765
He's looking for you.

1677
01:32:42,849 --> 01:32:46,477
Please help me, Mr. Potter. Help me, won't you, please?

1678
01:32:46,561 --> 01:32:48,395
Can't you see what it means to my family?

1679
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:51,315
l'll pay any sort of a bonus on the loan, any interest,

1680
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,983
if you still want the Building and Loan...

1681
01:32:53,068 --> 01:32:56,570
George, could it possibly be there's a slight discrepancy in the books?

1682
01:32:56,655 --> 01:32:58,197
No, sir. There's nothing wrong with the books.

1683
01:32:58,281 --> 01:33:01,283
l've just misplaced $8,000. l can't find it anywhere.

1684
01:33:01,368 --> 01:33:05,329
-You misplaced $8,000? -Yes, sir.

1685
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:12,044
-Have you notified the police? -No, sir. l didn't want the publicity.

1686
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:16,215
-Harry's homecoming tomorrow... -They're going to believe that one.

1687
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:18,592
What've you been doing, George?

1688
01:33:18,677 --> 01:33:20,386
Playing the market with the company's money?

1689
01:33:20,470 --> 01:33:21,595
No, sir. No, sir, l haven't.

1690
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,681
ls it a woman, then?

1691
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:27,351
You know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to Violet Bick.

1692
01:33:27,435 --> 01:33:28,477
What?

1693
01:33:28,561 --> 01:33:31,272
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me?

1694
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:34,108
Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?

1695
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:35,776
l can't get a hold of him. He's in Europe.

1696
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:37,278
Well, what about all your other friends?

1697
01:33:37,362 --> 01:33:39,697
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that.

1698
01:33:39,781 --> 01:33:41,699
You're the only one in town that can help me.

1699
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:46,203
l've suddenly become quite important.

1700
01:33:47,038 --> 01:33:49,707
What kind of security would l have, George?

1701
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:53,127
-Have you got any stocks? -No, sir.

1702
01:33:53,211 --> 01:33:56,046
Bonds? Real estate? Collateral of any kind?

1703
01:33:56,548 --> 01:34:00,759
l have some life insurance, a $1 5,000 policy.

1704
01:34:00,844 --> 01:34:04,555
-Yes. How much is your equity in it? -Five hundred dollars.

1705
01:34:04,723 --> 01:34:06,557
Five hundred dollars?

1706
01:34:06,975 --> 01:34:09,601
And you ask me to lend you $8,000?

1707
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:14,273
Look at you. You used to be so cocky.

1708
01:34:14,607 --> 01:34:17,693
You were going to go out and conquer the world.

1709
01:34:18,236 --> 01:34:23,032
You once called me a warped, frustrated old man.

1710
01:34:23,742 --> 01:34:27,077
What are you but a warped, frustrated young man?

1711
01:34:27,662 --> 01:34:29,246
A miserable little clerk,

1712
01:34:29,331 --> 01:34:30,998
crawling in here on your hands and knees

1713
01:34:31,082 --> 01:34:32,958
and begging for help.

1714
01:34:33,168 --> 01:34:35,085
No securities, no stocks, no bonds.

1715
01:34:35,170 --> 01:34:38,839
Nothing but a miserable little $500 equity

1716
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,091
in a life insurance policy.

1717
01:34:41,926 --> 01:34:44,345
You're worth more dead than alive.

1718
01:34:44,804 --> 01:34:47,806
Why don't you go to the riffraff you love so much

1719
01:34:47,891 --> 01:34:50,434
and ask them to let you have $8,000?

1720
01:34:50,852 --> 01:34:52,061
You know why?

1721
01:34:52,145 --> 01:34:54,855
Because they'd run you out of town on a rail.

1722
01:34:54,939 --> 01:34:58,150
But l tell you what l'm going to do for you, George.

1723
01:34:58,234 --> 01:35:01,403
Since the state examiner is still here,

1724
01:35:01,488 --> 01:35:04,031
as a stockholder of the Building and Loan,

1725
01:35:04,115 --> 01:35:07,076
l'm going to swear out a warrant for your arrest.

1726
01:35:07,452 --> 01:35:11,497
Misappropriation of funds, manipulation, malfeasance.

1727
01:35:13,124 --> 01:35:15,501
All right, George, go ahead.

1728
01:35:15,585 --> 01:35:18,462
You can't hide in a little town like this.

1729
01:35:18,713 --> 01:35:20,923
Yeah, Bill? This is Potter.

1730
01:35:34,687 --> 01:35:37,981
Merry Christmas! Glad you come!

1731
01:35:38,525 --> 01:35:40,192
How about some of that good spaghetti?

1732
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,985
We got everything.

1733
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:58,919
Oh, God.

1734
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,843
Dear Father in Heaven,

1735
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:10,973
l'm not a praying man,

1736
01:36:12,142 --> 01:36:15,060
but if you're up there and you can hear me,

1737
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:18,313
show me the way.

1738
01:36:18,773 --> 01:36:21,108
l'm at the end of my rope. l...

1739
01:36:23,027 --> 01:36:24,987
Show me the way, O God.

1740
01:36:29,868 --> 01:36:33,537
Are you all right, George? Want somebody to take you home?

1741
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:38,584
Why you drink so much, my friend?

1742
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:42,045
Please go home, Mr. Bailey. This is Christmas Eve.

1743
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:45,048
Bailey? Which Bailey?

1744
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:47,718
This is Mr. George Bailey.

1745
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:54,808
The next time you talk to my wife like that, you'll get worse!

1746
01:36:54,893 --> 01:36:56,226
She cried for an hour!

1747
01:36:56,311 --> 01:36:59,480
lt isn't enough she slaves teaching your stupid kids how to read and write,

1748
01:36:59,564 --> 01:37:02,107
-and you have to bawl her out. -You get out of here, Mr. Welch!

1749
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,650
Now, wait, l want to pay for my drink.

1750
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:05,402
Never mind the money! You get out of here quick!

1751
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:08,447
-All right! -You hit my best friend! Get out!

1752
01:37:13,786 --> 01:37:16,413
-You all right, George? -Who was that?

1753
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:19,917
He gone. No worry. He name is Welch.

1754
01:37:20,001 --> 01:37:22,794
-He no come into my place no more. -Oh, Welch.

1755
01:37:22,879 --> 01:37:24,796
That's what l get for praying.

1756
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,924
The last time he come in here. You hear that, Nick?

1757
01:37:27,008 --> 01:37:28,133
Yes, you bet.

1758
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:31,637
Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here it is.

1759
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,430
Oh, no, please, don't go this way, Mr. Bailey.

1760
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:35,182
-l'm all right. -No, no, you no feel so good.

1761
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,642
-Sit down and rest. -l'm all right.

1762
01:37:36,726 --> 01:37:38,810
Please no go away, please!

1763
01:37:57,288 --> 01:37:59,623
What do you think you're doing?

1764
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:05,587
Now look what you did. My great-grandfather planted this tree!

1765
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,465
Hey, you! Hey, you!

1766
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:12,970
Come back here, you drunken fool! Get this car out of here!

1767
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:24,481
Hey, what's the matter with you? Look where you're going.

1768
01:39:11,321 --> 01:39:12,446
Help!

1769
01:39:14,032 --> 01:39:22,039
Help! Help!

1770
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:26,293
Help!

1771
01:39:29,213 --> 01:39:33,133
Help! Help! Help! Help!

1772
01:39:39,307 --> 01:39:41,600
Help! Help!

1773
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,827
l didn't have time to get some stylish underwear.

1774
01:40:00,912 --> 01:40:03,705
Wife gave me this on my last birthday.

1775
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:06,124
l passed away in it.

1776
01:40:09,712 --> 01:40:12,589
Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.

1777
01:40:15,760 --> 01:40:19,221
You should read the new book Mark Twain's writing now.

1778
01:40:19,889 --> 01:40:21,765
How did you happen to fall in?

1779
01:40:21,849 --> 01:40:25,018
l didn't fall in. l jumped in to save George.

1780
01:40:25,311 --> 01:40:28,230
You what? To save me?

1781
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:31,525
Well, l did, didn't l? You didn't go through with it, did you?

1782
01:40:31,609 --> 01:40:33,735
-Go through with what? -Suicide.

1783
01:40:33,820 --> 01:40:36,905
lt's against the law to commit suicide around here.

1784
01:40:36,989 --> 01:40:39,825
Yeah, it's against the law where l come from, too.

1785
01:40:39,909 --> 01:40:42,285
-Where do you come from? -Heaven.

1786
01:40:47,417 --> 01:40:50,419
l had to act quickly. That's why l jumped in.

1787
01:40:50,503 --> 01:40:52,921
l knew if l were drowning, you'd try to save me.

1788
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:55,966
You see, you did, and that's how l saved you.

1789
01:40:56,676 --> 01:40:58,093
Very funny.

1790
01:40:58,302 --> 01:41:00,387
Your lip's bleeding, George.

1791
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:04,558
Yeah, l got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.

1792
01:41:04,642 --> 01:41:08,478
Oh, no, no, no, George, l'm the answer to your prayer.

1793
01:41:08,563 --> 01:41:10,897
That's why l was sent down here.

1794
01:41:11,482 --> 01:41:14,651
-How'd you know my name? -Oh, l know all about you.

1795
01:41:14,736 --> 01:41:16,570
l've watched you grow up from a little boy.

1796
01:41:16,654 --> 01:41:18,071
What are you, a mind reader or something?

1797
01:41:18,156 --> 01:41:19,281
No.

1798
01:41:19,365 --> 01:41:23,326
-Well, who are you then? -Clarence Oddbody, AS2.

1799
01:41:23,995 --> 01:41:25,328
Oddbody?

1800
01:41:26,372 --> 01:41:28,498
AS2? What's that, AS2?

1801
01:41:28,750 --> 01:41:30,500
Angel Second Class.

1802
01:41:40,887 --> 01:41:42,679
Cheerio, my good man.

1803
01:41:46,851 --> 01:41:48,268
Oh, brother.

1804
01:41:50,563 --> 01:41:51,855
Gee whiz.

1805
01:41:52,857 --> 01:41:55,692
l wonder what Martini put in those drinks.

1806
01:41:57,737 --> 01:42:02,282
Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago?

1807
01:42:02,575 --> 01:42:04,201
Why'd you want to save me?

1808
01:42:04,285 --> 01:42:07,871
That's what l was sent down for. l'm your guardian angel.

1809
01:42:08,289 --> 01:42:10,415
l wouldn't be a bit surprised.

1810
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:14,836
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money, $8,000.

1811
01:42:14,921 --> 01:42:17,964
Yeah, now, just things like that... How do you know that?

1812
01:42:18,049 --> 01:42:22,093
l told you. l'm your guardian angel. l know everything about you.

1813
01:42:23,095 --> 01:42:26,223
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel l'd get.

1814
01:42:26,307 --> 01:42:29,267
Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?

1815
01:42:29,352 --> 01:42:33,396
l haven't won my wings yet. That's why l'm an Angel Second Class.

1816
01:42:37,693 --> 01:42:39,236
l don't know whether l'd like it very much

1817
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,279
being seen around with an angel without any wings.

1818
01:42:41,364 --> 01:42:44,991
Oh, l've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?

1819
01:42:45,076 --> 01:42:46,451
Sure, sure.

1820
01:42:46,953 --> 01:42:49,579
-How? -By letting me help you.

1821
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:52,582
Yes. Only one way you can help me.

1822
01:42:52,667 --> 01:42:54,626
You don't happen to have 8,000 bucks on you, do you?

1823
01:42:54,710 --> 01:42:57,170
Oh, no. No. We don't use money in heaven.

1824
01:42:57,255 --> 01:42:59,798
Oh, yeah, that's right, l keep forgetting.

1825
01:43:00,508 --> 01:43:04,135
-Comes in pretty handy down here, bub. -Oh, tut, tut, tut.

1826
01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:07,430
l found it out a little late.

1827
01:43:07,807 --> 01:43:09,850
l'm worth more dead than alive.

1828
01:43:09,934 --> 01:43:14,104
Now, look, you mustn't talk like that. l won't get my wings with that attitude.

1829
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:17,858
You just don't know all that you've done. lf it hadn't been for you...

1830
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,652
Yeah, if it hadn't been for me, everybody'd be a lot better off.

1831
01:43:20,736 --> 01:43:22,946
My wife and my kids and my friends.

1832
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:26,283
l mean, look, little fellow, go off and haunt somebody else, will you?

1833
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:29,035
No, now, you don't understand. l've got my job...

1834
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:30,954
Oh, shut up, will you?

1835
01:43:34,834 --> 01:43:37,544
Oh, this isn't gonna be so easy.

1836
01:43:42,466 --> 01:43:46,970
Yeah, so you still think killing yourself would make everyone feel happier, eh?

1837
01:43:48,764 --> 01:43:51,558
Well, l don't know. l guess you're right.

1838
01:43:52,852 --> 01:43:55,729
l suppose it would have been better if l'd never been born at all.

1839
01:43:55,813 --> 01:43:59,149
-What'd you say? -l said l wish l'd never been born.

1840
01:43:59,233 --> 01:44:01,860
Oh, you mustn't say things like that.

1841
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:06,907
You... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea.

1842
01:44:07,867 --> 01:44:09,534
What do you think?

1843
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,953
Yeah, that'll do it.

1844
01:44:12,622 --> 01:44:13,955
All right.

1845
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,878
You've got your wish. You've never been born.

1846
01:44:25,468 --> 01:44:28,511
You don't have to make all that fuss about it!

1847
01:44:29,388 --> 01:44:30,805
What did you say?

1848
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:34,768
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.

1849
01:44:34,852 --> 01:44:38,104
No worries, no obligations, no $8,000 to get,

1850
01:44:38,189 --> 01:44:40,065
no Potter looking for you with the Sheriff.

1851
01:44:40,149 --> 01:44:43,610
-Say something else in that ear. -Sure, you can hear out of it.

1852
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:45,820
Well, that's the doggonedest thing.

1853
01:44:45,905 --> 01:44:48,448
l haven't heard anything out of that ear since l was a kid.

1854
01:44:48,532 --> 01:44:50,700
Must have been that jump in that cold water.

1855
01:44:50,785 --> 01:44:53,536
Your lip stopped bleeding, too, George.

1856
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:01,920
What do you know about that? What's happening?

1857
01:45:03,381 --> 01:45:05,674
lt stopped snowing out here, didn't it?

1858
01:45:05,758 --> 01:45:07,550
What's happened here?

1859
01:45:08,260 --> 01:45:10,178
What l need is a couple of good stiff drinks.

1860
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:12,555
How about you, Angel? You want a drink?

1861
01:45:14,058 --> 01:45:16,309
Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry...

1862
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:18,353
The clothes are dry.

1863
01:45:18,437 --> 01:45:21,606
What do you know about that? Stove's hotter than l thought.

1864
01:45:21,691 --> 01:45:25,819
Now, come on, get your clothes on. We'll stroll up to my car and get...

1865
01:45:25,903 --> 01:45:28,071
Oh, l'm sorry. l'll stroll. You fly.

1866
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,698
l can't fly. l haven't got my wings.

1867
01:45:29,782 --> 01:45:32,492
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.

1868
01:45:38,124 --> 01:45:39,499
What's the matter?

1869
01:45:39,583 --> 01:45:42,293
Well, this is where l left my car, and it isn't here.

1870
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:45,672
-You have no car. -Well, l had a car, and it was right here.

1871
01:45:45,756 --> 01:45:47,298
l guess somebody moved it.

1872
01:45:47,383 --> 01:45:51,469
-Good evening. -Oh, say, hey, where's my car?

1873
01:45:51,721 --> 01:45:53,847
-l beg your pardon? -My car, my car.

1874
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:56,182
l'm the fellow that owns the car that ran into your tree.

1875
01:45:56,267 --> 01:45:58,309
-What tree? -What do you mean, what tree?

1876
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:00,478
This tree. Here, l ran into it.

1877
01:46:00,563 --> 01:46:03,773
Cut a big gash in the side of it there.

1878
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:11,573
You must mean two other trees. You had me worried.

1879
01:46:11,657 --> 01:46:13,867
One of the oldest trees in Pottersville.

1880
01:46:13,951 --> 01:46:15,118
Pottersville?

1881
01:46:15,202 --> 01:46:16,828
Why, you mean Bedford Falls.

1882
01:46:16,912 --> 01:46:20,457
l mean Pottersville. Don't you think l know where l live?

1883
01:46:20,624 --> 01:46:22,709
What's the matter with you?

1884
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:26,004
What's the matter with me? Well, l guess l just...

1885
01:46:28,591 --> 01:46:32,886
Oh, l don't know. Either l'm off my nut or he is or you are.

1886
01:46:33,888 --> 01:46:35,221
lt isn't me.

1887
01:46:35,306 --> 01:46:37,348
Well, maybe l left the car up at Martini's.

1888
01:46:37,433 --> 01:46:39,768
-Well, come on, Gabriel. -Clarence.

1889
01:46:39,852 --> 01:46:41,644
Clarence. Clarence.

1890
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:50,945
That's all right. Go on in. Martini is a friend of mine.

1891
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:53,990
There's a place to sit down. Sit down.

1892
01:47:00,331 --> 01:47:03,875
-Oh, hello, Nick. Hey, where's Martini? -Want a martini?

1893
01:47:03,959 --> 01:47:06,002
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?

1894
01:47:06,087 --> 01:47:08,505
Hey, look, l'm the boss. You want a drink or don't you?

1895
01:47:08,589 --> 01:47:10,799
Okay, all right. Double bourbon, will you, and quick, huh?

1896
01:47:10,883 --> 01:47:12,133
Okay.

1897
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:18,348
-What's yours? -l was just thinking.

1898
01:47:19,517 --> 01:47:21,935
lt's been so long since l...

1899
01:47:22,019 --> 01:47:25,688
Look, mister, l'm standing here waiting for you to make up your mind.

1900
01:47:25,773 --> 01:47:27,398
That's a good man.

1901
01:47:27,483 --> 01:47:29,651
l was just thinking

1902
01:47:30,528 --> 01:47:33,696
of a flaming rum punch.

1903
01:47:34,031 --> 01:47:36,574
No, it's not cold enough for that, not nearly cold enough.

1904
01:47:36,659 --> 01:47:39,619
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. l got it.

1905
01:47:39,703 --> 01:47:43,289
Mulled wine, heavy on the cinnamon and light on the cloves.

1906
01:47:43,374 --> 01:47:45,291
Off with you, me lad, and be lively!

1907
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:48,419
Hey, look, mister, we serve hard drinks in here

1908
01:47:48,504 --> 01:47:50,296
for men who want to get drunk fast.

1909
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:53,925
And we don't need any characters around to give the joint atmosphere.

1910
01:47:54,009 --> 01:47:57,637
ls that clear, or do l have to slip you my left for a convincer?

1911
01:47:57,721 --> 01:47:59,097
What's he talking about?

1912
01:47:59,181 --> 01:48:03,059
Nick, Nick, just give him the same as mine.

1913
01:48:03,144 --> 01:48:05,478
-He's okay. -Okay.

1914
01:48:06,897 --> 01:48:10,483
What's the matter with him? l never saw Nick act like that before.

1915
01:48:10,568 --> 01:48:13,695
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.

1916
01:48:13,946 --> 01:48:15,738
Oh, yeah.

1917
01:48:16,866 --> 01:48:22,537
Hey, little fellow, you worry me, you know.

1918
01:48:22,621 --> 01:48:25,582
-You got someplace to sleep? -No.

1919
01:48:25,666 --> 01:48:27,208
You don't, huh?

1920
01:48:27,293 --> 01:48:29,919
-Well, you got any money? -No.

1921
01:48:30,880 --> 01:48:32,505
No wonder you jumped in the river.

1922
01:48:32,590 --> 01:48:36,259
l jumped in the river to save you so l could get my wings.

1923
01:48:40,097 --> 01:48:42,223
-Somebody's just made it. -Made what?

1924
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:47,103
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.

1925
01:48:54,987 --> 01:48:57,739
Look, l think maybe you better not mention

1926
01:48:57,823 --> 01:48:59,199
getting your wings around here.

1927
01:48:59,283 --> 01:49:01,701
Why? Don't they believe in angels?

1928
01:49:04,288 --> 01:49:06,122
Yeah, they believe in them.

1929
01:49:06,207 --> 01:49:09,500
Oh, why should they be surprised when they see one?

1930
01:49:11,295 --> 01:49:14,547
Oh, he never grew up. He's...

1931
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:18,968
-How old are you anyway, Clarence? -Two hundred and ninety-three,

1932
01:49:21,180 --> 01:49:22,472
next May.

1933
01:49:23,057 --> 01:49:25,683
That does it. Out, you two pixies!

1934
01:49:25,768 --> 01:49:27,727
Go through the door or out the window.

1935
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,896
-Look, Nick, what's wrong? -Now, that's another thing.

1936
01:49:29,980 --> 01:49:31,940
Where do you come off calling me Nick?

1937
01:49:32,024 --> 01:49:33,524
Well, Nick, that's your name.

1938
01:49:33,609 --> 01:49:37,737
What's that got to do with it? l don't know you from Adam's off ox.

1939
01:49:37,821 --> 01:49:40,698
Hey. Hey, you rummy, there. Come here, come here.

1940
01:49:44,161 --> 01:49:47,747
Didn't l tell you never to come panhandling around here, huh?

1941
01:49:54,838 --> 01:49:58,758
Mr. Gower.

1942
01:50:00,386 --> 01:50:02,136
What... What did...

1943
01:50:02,513 --> 01:50:04,931
Mr. Gower, look, this is George Bailey.

1944
01:50:06,308 --> 01:50:08,434
-Don't you know me? -No.

1945
01:50:10,020 --> 01:50:11,229
No.

1946
01:50:11,313 --> 01:50:12,772
Throw him out. Throw him out.

1947
01:50:12,856 --> 01:50:14,857
Mr. Gower! Hey, what is...

1948
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:18,278
Hey, Nick. Nick. lsn't that Mr. Gower, the druggist?

1949
01:50:18,362 --> 01:50:20,613
You know, that's another reason for me not to like you.

1950
01:50:20,698 --> 01:50:24,117
That rum head spent 20 years in jail for poisoning a kid.

1951
01:50:24,201 --> 01:50:27,078
lf you know him, you must be a jailbird yourself.

1952
01:50:27,162 --> 01:50:29,205
Would you show these gentlemen to the door?

1953
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:31,332
Sure. This way, gentlemen.

1954
01:50:36,755 --> 01:50:38,047
Stay out.

1955
01:50:39,216 --> 01:50:41,801
Get me! l'm giving out wings!

1956
01:50:44,471 --> 01:50:46,973
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower

1957
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:48,766
from putting that poison into the capsules.

1958
01:50:48,851 --> 01:50:52,520
What do you mean, l wasn't there? l remember distinctly...

1959
01:50:54,732 --> 01:50:57,150
Hey, what's going on around here?

1960
01:50:57,401 --> 01:50:58,776
What...

1961
01:50:59,903 --> 01:51:02,572
Why, this ought to be Martini's place.

1962
01:51:08,454 --> 01:51:10,121
Look, who are you?

1963
01:51:10,372 --> 01:51:12,915
l told you, George. l'm your guardian angel.

1964
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:15,251
Yeah, yeah, l know. You told me that.

1965
01:51:20,841 --> 01:51:24,093
What else are you? What, are you a hypnotist?

1966
01:51:24,178 --> 01:51:25,345
No. Of course not.

1967
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:28,014
Well, then, why am l seeing all these strange things here?

1968
01:51:28,098 --> 01:51:32,518
Don't you understand, George? lt's because you were not born.

1969
01:51:32,603 --> 01:51:36,898
-Well, if l wasn't born, who am l? -You're nobody. You have no identity.

1970
01:51:36,982 --> 01:51:39,650
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.

1971
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:41,778
There is no George Bailey.

1972
01:51:42,905 --> 01:51:47,241
You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license,

1973
01:51:47,659 --> 01:51:50,411
no 4-F card, no insurance policy.

1974
01:51:51,413 --> 01:51:53,414
They're not there, either.

1975
01:51:54,625 --> 01:51:56,959
-What? -Zuzu's petals.

1976
01:52:02,466 --> 01:52:05,176
You've been given a great gift, George,

1977
01:52:05,344 --> 01:52:08,971
a chance to see what the world would be like without you.

1978
01:52:11,308 --> 01:52:13,935
Now, wait a minute here. Wait a minute here.

1979
01:52:15,813 --> 01:52:19,148
This is some sort of a funny dream l'm having.

1980
01:52:19,316 --> 01:52:21,109
So long, mister. l'm going home.

1981
01:52:21,193 --> 01:52:24,070
-Home? What home? -Shut up! Cut it out!

1982
01:52:24,571 --> 01:52:28,616
You're crazy! That's what l think. You're screwy.

1983
01:52:29,034 --> 01:52:31,744
You're driving me crazy, too. l'm seeing things here.

1984
01:52:31,829 --> 01:52:33,746
l'm going home and see my wife and family.

1985
01:52:33,831 --> 01:52:36,999
You understand that? And l'm going home alone.

1986
01:52:39,378 --> 01:52:41,295
How am l doing, Joseph?

1987
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:43,214
Thanks.

1988
01:52:43,549 --> 01:52:45,633
No, l didn't have a drink.

1989
01:53:36,852 --> 01:53:39,395
Hey, hey, where did the Building and Loan move to?

1990
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,480
Building and what?

1991
01:53:40,564 --> 01:53:42,315
The Bailey Building and Loan. lt was up there.

1992
01:53:42,399 --> 01:53:44,275
They went out of business years ago.

1993
01:53:44,359 --> 01:53:45,735
That sailor's a liar!

1994
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:48,112
l know every big shot in this town!

1995
01:53:48,197 --> 01:53:50,740
l know Potter, and l'll have you kicked off the beat.

1996
01:53:50,824 --> 01:53:52,283
Hey, Violet!

1997
01:53:53,494 --> 01:53:56,078
Hey, hey! Listen. That's Violet Bick.

1998
01:53:56,163 --> 01:53:58,289
-l know. -l know that girl!

1999
01:53:58,373 --> 01:54:00,166
Take a walk. Beat it.

2000
01:54:02,169 --> 01:54:03,920
Hey, Ernie! Ernie.

2001
01:54:06,089 --> 01:54:08,007
Ernie, take me home. l'm going off my nut.

2002
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,091
Where do you live?

2003
01:54:09,176 --> 01:54:11,260
Now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff.

2004
01:54:11,345 --> 01:54:13,846
You know where l live. 320 Sycamore. Now hurry up.

2005
01:54:13,931 --> 01:54:17,391
-All right. 320 Sycamore? -Yeah, yeah, hurry up. Zuzu's sick.

2006
01:54:17,476 --> 01:54:19,310
-Come on. -All right. All right.

2007
01:54:19,937 --> 01:54:21,979
Come on, Ernie, now straighten me out here.

2008
01:54:22,064 --> 01:54:25,066
Look, l've got some bad liquor or something. Listen to me.

2009
01:54:25,150 --> 01:54:26,359
Now, you are Ernie Bishop,

2010
01:54:26,443 --> 01:54:28,194
and you live in Bailey Park with your wife and kid?

2011
01:54:28,278 --> 01:54:30,321
-That's right, isn't it? -You seen my wife?

2012
01:54:30,405 --> 01:54:33,658
Seen your wife? l've been to your house 1 00 times.

2013
01:54:33,742 --> 01:54:36,536
Look, bud, what's the idea? l live in a shack in Potter's Field,

2014
01:54:36,620 --> 01:54:38,663
my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid,

2015
01:54:38,747 --> 01:54:41,207
and l ain't never seen you before in my life, see?

2016
01:54:41,291 --> 01:54:44,085
Okay, well, just step on it. Just get me home!

2017
01:55:01,603 --> 01:55:03,896
-ls this the place? -Of course it's the place.

2018
01:55:03,981 --> 01:55:07,191
Well, this house ain't been lived in for 20 years.

2019
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:15,241
-What's up, Ernie? -l don't know.

2020
01:55:15,325 --> 01:55:18,494
But we better keep our eye on this guy. He's bats.

2021
01:55:35,971 --> 01:55:38,180
Mary. Mary!

2022
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:44,020
Tommy! Pete! Janie! Zuzu! Where are you?

2023
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:47,106
They're not here, George. You have no children.

2024
01:55:47,190 --> 01:55:48,608
Where are they? What have you done with them?

2025
01:55:48,692 --> 01:55:50,860
All right, put up your hands. No fast moves.

2026
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:52,528
Come on out here, both of you.

2027
01:55:52,613 --> 01:55:54,947
-Bert! Thank heaven you're here. -Back this.

2028
01:55:55,032 --> 01:55:58,284
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?

2029
01:55:58,368 --> 01:56:00,036
-Watch him, Bert. -Come on, come on.

2030
01:56:00,120 --> 01:56:02,163
Bert, Ernie. What's the matter with you two guys?

2031
01:56:02,247 --> 01:56:03,748
You were here on my wedding night.

2032
01:56:03,832 --> 01:56:05,458
You, both of you, stood out there on the porch

2033
01:56:05,542 --> 01:56:07,835
-and sung to us, don't you remember? -Think l'd better be going.

2034
01:56:07,919 --> 01:56:09,253
Look, now, why don't you be a good kid,

2035
01:56:09,338 --> 01:56:10,463
and we'll take you in to a doctor?

2036
01:56:10,547 --> 01:56:12,506
-Everything's gonna be all right. -Bert, no, listen to me.

2037
01:56:12,591 --> 01:56:14,467
Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house?

2038
01:56:14,551 --> 01:56:17,011
Bert, listen. lt's that fellow here. He says he's an angel.

2039
01:56:17,095 --> 01:56:20,556
-He's trying to hypnotize me. -l hate to do this to you, bud, but...

2040
01:56:21,892 --> 01:56:24,602
Run, George! Run, George! Run!

2041
01:56:26,313 --> 01:56:29,106
-Joseph! Help! Help! -Oh, shut up.

2042
01:56:29,232 --> 01:56:32,068
Oh, Joseph! Joseph!

2043
01:56:37,866 --> 01:56:41,160
Where'd he go? Where'd he go? l had him right here.

2044
01:56:43,914 --> 01:56:45,456
l need a drink.

2045
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:48,584
Well, which way did he go? Help me find him.

2046
01:56:58,470 --> 01:56:59,595
Well?

2047
01:57:02,849 --> 01:57:04,058
Mother.

2048
01:57:06,061 --> 01:57:08,104
Mother? What do you want?

2049
01:57:09,272 --> 01:57:11,941
Mother, this is George.

2050
01:57:12,275 --> 01:57:14,068
l thought sure you'd remember me.

2051
01:57:14,152 --> 01:57:15,569
George who?

2052
01:57:15,654 --> 01:57:17,530
lf you're looking for a room, there's no vacancy.

2053
01:57:17,614 --> 01:57:20,950
Mother, listen. Please help me. Something terrible's happened to me.

2054
01:57:21,034 --> 01:57:23,452
l don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody.

2055
01:57:23,537 --> 01:57:26,497
Please let me come in, and keep me here until l get over it.

2056
01:57:26,581 --> 01:57:28,916
Get over what? l don't take in strangers

2057
01:57:29,000 --> 01:57:31,544
unless they're sent here by somebody l know.

2058
01:57:31,878 --> 01:57:36,882
Well, l know everybody you know. Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

2059
01:57:36,967 --> 01:57:38,676
-You know him? -Well, sure l do.

2060
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:40,886
-When did you see him last? -Today over at his house.

2061
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:42,096
lt's a lie.

2062
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:45,057
He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business.

2063
01:57:45,142 --> 01:57:48,018
And if you ask me, that's where you belong.

2064
01:57:59,948 --> 01:58:01,615
Strange, isn't it?

2065
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:04,994
Each man's life touches so many other lives.

2066
01:58:05,454 --> 01:58:08,414
And when he isn't around, he leaves an awful hole, doesn't he?

2067
01:58:08,498 --> 01:58:09,665
l've heard of things like this.

2068
01:58:09,750 --> 01:58:11,500
You got me in some kind of a spell or something.

2069
01:58:11,585 --> 01:58:13,669
Well, l'm gonna get out of it. l'll get out of it.

2070
01:58:13,754 --> 01:58:15,546
l know how, too. l...

2071
01:58:15,964 --> 01:58:17,089
The last man l talked to,

2072
01:58:17,174 --> 01:58:19,341
before all this stuff started happening to me, was Martini.

2073
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:20,634
You know where he lives?

2074
01:58:20,719 --> 01:58:23,637
Well, sure, l know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.

2075
01:58:27,225 --> 01:58:31,687
-Are you sure this is Bailey Park? -No, l'm not sure of anything anymore.

2076
01:58:32,564 --> 01:58:35,399
All l know is this should be Bailey Park.

2077
01:58:36,193 --> 01:58:39,945
-But where are the houses? -You weren't here to build them.

2078
01:58:44,534 --> 01:58:47,536
Your brother Harry Bailey broke through the ice

2079
01:58:47,621 --> 01:58:49,497
and was drowned at the age of nine.

2080
01:58:49,581 --> 01:58:51,665
That's a lie. Harry Bailey went to war.

2081
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:53,209
He got the Congressional Medal of Honor.

2082
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:55,252
He saved the lives of every man on that transport.

2083
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:57,379
Every man on that transport died.

2084
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:58,798
Harry wasn't there to save them,

2085
01:58:58,882 --> 01:59:01,592
because you weren't there to save Harry.

2086
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:16,315
You see, George? You really had a wonderful life.

2087
01:59:16,775 --> 01:59:20,861
Don't you see what a mistake it would be to throw it away?

2088
01:59:21,530 --> 01:59:23,447
-Clarence. -Yes, George?

2089
01:59:24,449 --> 01:59:27,660
-Where's Mary? -Oh, well, l can't...

2090
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:30,287
l don't know how you know these things, but tell me, where is she?

2091
01:59:30,372 --> 01:59:32,331
lf you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.

2092
01:59:32,415 --> 01:59:35,417
-l'm not supposed to tell. -Please, Clarence, tell me where she is.

2093
01:59:35,502 --> 01:59:37,837
-You're not gonna like it, George. -Where is she?

2094
01:59:37,921 --> 01:59:40,256
She's an old maid. She never married.

2095
01:59:40,340 --> 01:59:42,675
Where is Mary? Where is she? Where is she?

2096
01:59:42,759 --> 01:59:45,678
She's just about to close up the library!

2097
01:59:49,558 --> 01:59:52,935
There must be some easier way for me to get my wings.

2098
02:00:04,447 --> 02:00:15,833
Mary!

2099
02:00:17,252 --> 02:00:18,794
Mary! Mary!

2100
02:00:18,962 --> 02:00:21,714
Mary, it's George. Don't you know me? What's happened to us?

2101
02:00:21,798 --> 02:00:23,132
l don't know you. Let me go!

2102
02:00:23,216 --> 02:00:26,260
Mary, please! Oh, don't do this to me. Please, Mary, help me.

2103
02:00:26,344 --> 02:00:28,512
Where's our kids? l need you, Mary.

2104
02:00:29,180 --> 02:00:30,973
Help me, Mary!

2105
02:00:31,224 --> 02:00:32,850
Mary! Let me go!

2106
02:00:33,143 --> 02:00:34,852
Help! lt's a wild man!

2107
02:00:36,104 --> 02:00:38,772
The wild man is chasing me. Somebody stop him!

2108
02:00:38,857 --> 02:00:41,442
Tom! Ed! Charlie!

2109
02:00:42,152 --> 02:00:43,485
That's my wife!

2110
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:47,573
-Mary! -No, you don't.

2111
02:00:47,657 --> 02:00:48,741
Somebody call the police.

2112
02:00:48,825 --> 02:00:50,159
Somebody hit him on the head with a bottle.

2113
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,369
You need a straightjacket.

2114
02:00:53,496 --> 02:00:54,788
Clarence!

2115
02:00:55,248 --> 02:00:56,832
Get out of here!

2116
02:00:56,917 --> 02:00:58,167
Clarence!

2117
02:00:59,878 --> 02:01:02,338
-Clarence! -Right, that's you!

2118
02:01:05,467 --> 02:01:06,842
Stand back!

2119
02:01:10,555 --> 02:01:22,316
Clarence!

2120
02:01:27,238 --> 02:01:29,490
Clarence! Clarence!

2121
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:32,826
Help me, Clarence!

2122
02:01:33,954 --> 02:01:35,371
Get me back!

2123
02:01:36,206 --> 02:01:39,166
Get me back. l don't care what happens to me.

2124
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:41,877
Get me back to my wife and kids.

2125
02:01:42,045 --> 02:01:44,129
Help me, Clarence, please.

2126
02:01:44,631 --> 02:01:49,259
Please. l want to live again. l want to live again.

2127
02:01:51,012 --> 02:01:55,015
l want to live again. Please, God, let me live again.

2128
02:02:04,067 --> 02:02:05,484
Hey, George!

2129
02:02:06,903 --> 02:02:08,070
George!

2130
02:02:09,114 --> 02:02:11,156
You all right. Hey, what's the matter?

2131
02:02:11,241 --> 02:02:13,659
Now get out of here, Bert, or l'll hit you again! Get out of here!

2132
02:02:13,743 --> 02:02:15,494
What the sam hill are you yelling for, George?

2133
02:02:15,578 --> 02:02:17,079
You...

2134
02:02:18,415 --> 02:02:21,291
George? Bert, do you know me?

2135
02:02:21,626 --> 02:02:23,627
Know you? You kidding?

2136
02:02:23,712 --> 02:02:25,838
l've been looking all over town trying to find you.

2137
02:02:25,922 --> 02:02:28,882
l saw your car piled into that tree down there, and l thought maybe you...

2138
02:02:28,967 --> 02:02:31,218
Hey, your mouth's bleeding. Are you sure you're all right?

2139
02:02:31,302 --> 02:02:32,803
What did...

2140
02:02:36,683 --> 02:02:39,852
My mouth's bleeding, Bert! My mouth's...

2141
02:02:40,103 --> 02:02:43,188
Zuzu's petals. Zuzu... There they are!

2142
02:02:43,273 --> 02:02:46,191
Bert! What do you know about that?

2143
02:02:46,276 --> 02:02:50,029
-Merry Christmas! -Well, Merry Christmas.

2144
02:02:50,447 --> 02:02:53,574
Mary! Mary!

2145
02:03:02,208 --> 02:03:04,209
Hello, Bedford Falls!

2146
02:03:07,213 --> 02:03:08,589
Merry Christmas!

2147
02:03:08,673 --> 02:03:10,507
-Merry Christmas, George! -Merry Christmas!

2148
02:03:10,592 --> 02:03:12,468
Merry Christmas, George.

2149
02:03:12,552 --> 02:03:14,970
Merry Christmas, movie house!

2150
02:03:15,513 --> 02:03:17,806
Merry Christmas, emporium!

2151
02:03:19,059 --> 02:03:22,770
Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan!

2152
02:03:26,983 --> 02:03:30,569
Hey, Merry Christmas, Mr. Potter!

2153
02:03:30,653 --> 02:03:33,363
Happy New Year to you in jail!

2154
02:03:33,448 --> 02:03:35,491
Go on home. They're waiting for you.

2155
02:03:37,077 --> 02:03:40,079
Mary! Mary!

2156
02:03:41,790 --> 02:03:42,873
Mary!

2157
02:03:43,792 --> 02:03:46,627
Well, hello, Mr. Bank Examiner! How are you?

2158
02:03:46,711 --> 02:03:48,921
-Mr. Bailey, there's a deficit. -l know, $8,000.

2159
02:03:49,005 --> 02:03:50,464
George, l've got a little paper here.

2160
02:03:50,548 --> 02:03:51,840
l'll bet it's a warrant for my arrest.

2161
02:03:51,925 --> 02:03:53,592
lsn't it wonderful? l'm going to jail!

2162
02:03:53,676 --> 02:03:56,053
Merry Christmas! Reporters? Where's Mary?

2163
02:03:56,137 --> 02:03:58,931
Mary! Oh, look at this wonderful, old drafty house.

2164
02:03:59,015 --> 02:04:01,308
Mary! Mary!

2165
02:04:02,560 --> 02:04:03,685
Mary.

2166
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:06,105
Have you seen my wife?

2167
02:04:06,189 --> 02:04:09,066
Merry Christmas, Daddy.

2168
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:11,193
Kids! Pete!

2169
02:04:15,865 --> 02:04:17,116
Kids! Janie!

2170
02:04:17,200 --> 02:04:18,700
Janie! Tommy!

2171
02:04:20,829 --> 02:04:23,705
Let me look at you. Oh, l could eat you up.

2172
02:04:24,457 --> 02:04:25,541
Where's your mother?

2173
02:04:25,625 --> 02:04:27,417
-She went looking for you. -With Uncle Billy.

Right there, and don't move. Don't move.

She told some people you were in trouble,

2201
02:05:39,240 --> 02:05:41,200
and they scattered all over town collecting money.

Didn't ask any questions.

2203

Just a minute. Just a minute. Quiet, everybody. Quiet, quiet.
