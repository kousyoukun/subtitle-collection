This old thing?

No, thanks.

But Harry will tear his dinner suit. George!
哈里会扯破他的晚礼服的，乔治！

290
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,121
That's why all children should be girls.
所以说生男不如生闺女好

291
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:32,864
Well, if they were all girls there wouldn't be any... Oh, never mind.
要是都生闺女那我们家…算了

292
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:35,538
George, Harry, come down to dinner this minute.
乔治，哈里，快下来吃晚饭

George, sit down and have dinner.

你怎么还没穿好礼服好去参加毕业派对？ 看看你这副样子

我才不在乎呢，反正是乔治的礼服

Annie, my sweet, have you got those pies?
亲爱的安妮，馅饼都准备好了吧？

If you lay a hand on me, I'll hit you with this broom!
你要敢碰我一下，我就拿扫帚打你

00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:07,694
Annie, I'm in love with you. There's a moon out tonight.
安妮，我爱你，我们今晚去赏月吧

305
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,765
Boy, oh boy, oh boy! My last meal in the old Bailey boarding house.
我的乖乖，这可是我离家前“最后的晚餐”了

Oh, my lands, my blood pressure.
天哪，我的血压又高了

Pop, can I have the car? I gotta take over a lot of plates and things.
老爸，能借你的车子用用吗？ 有好多碗碟和杂物要带去派对

Mom, I'm chairman of the Eats Committee.

310
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,142
We only need a couple of dozen.
只需要几打碗碟而已

311
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,415
Oh, no, you don't, Harry. Now, not my best Haviland, no.
不行，哈里，别打我那些 哈维兰碗碟的主意

312
00:15:23,522 --> 00:15:25,478
Oh, let him have the plates, Mother.
就让他拿吧，孩子他妈

313

What's the matter? You look tired.

316
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:34,056
I had another tussle with Potter today.
我今天又跟波特吵了一架

317
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,224
I thought when we put him on the board of directors,
我还以为让他加入董事会…

318
00:15:36,368 --> 00:15:37,665
he'd ease up on us a little bit.
他会放我们一马

319

这个视财如命的老奸商 到底怎么回事？

Sick in his soul, if he has one.
灵魂也有问题，如果他还有灵魂的话

322
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,107

Gangway. Gangway.

我给你打领带系领结，快点

00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:00,885
You coming later, George?

What do you mean, and be bored to death?

Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls,
今晚美女如云，死也值得

况且还可以试试新舞池呢

Oh, Pop, just a little?

No, Son. Not one drop.

Boys and girls and music.

340
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:19,203
Pretty much.

You know, George, I wish we could send Harry to college with you.
乔治，我希望也能送哈里上大学

Your mother and I talked it over half the night.

We have that all figured out.

Well, no younger than I was.

I said you were born older.

when you get out of college.

build things, design new buildings, plan modern cities.

Still after that first million before you're 30?
还在盘算着30岁前当上百万富翁吗？

357
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,836
I'll settle for half that in cash.
挣个50万我就心满意足了

Of course, it's just a hope.

to the Building and Loan, would you?

362
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:12,086
Annie, why don't you draw up a chair?
安妮，你干嘛不拿个凳子来…

363
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,756
Then you'd be more comfortable, and you could hear everything that's going on.
坐下来舒舒服服地慢慢听我们讲

366
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,266
I know it's soon to talk about it.

No, now, Pop, I couldn't.
爸爸，我做不到

对不起，我不是那个意思…

371
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,951
It's this business of nickels and dimes
这种分毫必算的工作不适合我

372
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,216
and spending all your life trying to figure out

how to save three cents on a length of pipe.
算计如何在一根管子上节省3分钱

那样我会疯掉的 我想要干出一番大事业

we're doing something important,

satisfying a fundamental urge.

有瓦遮头，添屋置业是很多人的梦想

379

I know, Pop. I know that.

I wish I felt that...

383
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:09,217
I've been hoarding pennies like a miser here in order to...

Most of my friends have already finished college.
我的好友大多都已大学毕业

385
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,918
I just feel like if I didn't get away, I'd bust.
我要再不走就注定会碌碌无为

386
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,657
Yes, yes, you're right, Son.
没错，你说得对，儿子

387

You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?

This town is no place for any man

unless he's willing to crawl to Potter.
否则在镇上是混不下去的

391
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:33,071
You get yourself an education and get out of here.
你就去上你的大学闯世界去吧

392
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,445
Pop, you want a shock?
爸，想听点猛料吗？

393
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:41,043
I think you're a great guy.
在我心中你都是个伟大的人

394
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:46,888
- Why, did you hear that, Annie? - I heard it.
-你听到没，安妮？ -听到了

395
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:49,222
It's about time one of you lunkheads said it.
你们傻哥俩也该是时候说这话了

If I told you, it might not come true.

然后你吞下月亮，它慢慢融化

Maybe I could sell tickets.

I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the Building and Loan.
对外而言，彼得.贝利 就是建房贷款合作公司

That's fine, Potter, coming from you,

620
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,015
considering that you probably drove him to his grave.
不就是你害他心力交瘁，撒手西去的吗？

Peter Bailey was not a businessman.

我没任何对他不敬的意思 上帝保佑他安息吧

624
00:31:10,401 --> 00:31:13,825
He was a man of high ideals, so-called.
他是个有所谓远大理想的人

625
00:31:14,305 --> 00:31:18,036

626
00:31:18,977 --> 00:31:21,775
Now, you take this loan here to Ernie Bishop,
就比如这笔借给厄尼.毕舍普的贷款

instead of a thrifty working class.
而不是勤俭的工人

641
00:32:01,986 --> 00:32:05,774
And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers
这全因为一些像彼得.贝利那样的空想家

00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:09,053
like Peter Bailey stir them up and fill their heads

等一等，波特先生

你说我父亲没生意头脑，这点没错

I'll never know.

But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character,

because his whole life was...

他攒的钱都不够送哈里上学 更别说送我了

但一些人的确在他帮助下 搬出了你的贫民窟

655
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:43,251
And what's wrong with that? Why, here, you're all businessmen here.
那有错吗？在座的各位都是生意人 你们评评理

656

You can take this one off now.

Well, no, Charlie. I didn't even ask him. We don't need Potter over here.
没有，查理，我问都没问 我不想波特伸魔掌到这里来

You're thinking of this place all wrong,

好像我把钱锁进了保险箱似的 钱不在这儿

然后他们再尽力还钱给你

因为我们挡住他发财路了

换作是波特的话 你的房子还能保住吗？

but just what exactly did you want to see me about?

乔治，你这点我最喜欢了

being seen around with an angel without any wings.
不知道会否让我掉面子

不准你说这种话 你这态度会害我争取不到翅膀的

1858
