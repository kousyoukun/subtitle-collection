00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,280
多莉・弗雷德金回来了
Tori Frederking is back.

8
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,400
暑假她去欧洲旅行了
Her parents sent her to Europe

9
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,630
她父母送的毕业大礼
for the summer as a graduation gift...

10
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,710
不过她已经回来了
but she's back.

11
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,590
已经有3个人在这个商场里看到过她了
Now I have 3 confirmed sitings of her in this mall.

12
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,180
麦特  我对多莉・弗雷德金没兴趣
Matt, I don't care about Tori Frederking.

13
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:38,320
我对眼前这位风情万种的女人更有兴趣
I care about her, aged to perfection.

14
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,710
我的菜
Daddy likie.

15
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,180
巴里  好好听我说
Barry, you gotta focus here, man.

16
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,680
我说的可是弗雷德金哦
I'm talking about "The Frederking".

17
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,680
是你要好好想想
You have to focus, okay.

18
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,820
十年级的时候
That was in the 10th grade.

19
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,780
你们俩跑到一个衣柜里玩大冒险
You got Truth or Dared into a closet with the girl.

20
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:51,710
确切地说是天堂七分钟
That was literally, seven minutes in heaven.

21
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,080
当我们从衣柜里出来
When we got out of that closet,

22
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,050
她跟在场的人说我是
she told everyone at the party that I was...

23
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,220
-接吻高手  -接吻高手
- An amazing kisser. - An amazing kisser.

24
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,420
她确实说了
She did!

25
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,140
可是  你都没有吻她
But, you didn't kiss her.

26
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,260
整整七分钟
You spent seven minutes

27
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,800
你吓得动都不敢动
shitting your pants and not making a move.

28
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,490
我知道自己逊毙了  她镇定得很
I know, that's what makes her so fucking awesome.

29
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:04,370
从衣柜出来之后
When I got out of the closet,

30
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:06,130
大家都在取笑我
everyone started ragging on me for choking.

31
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,830
她就撒谎说我是个接吻高手
She lied and said I was an amazing kisser.

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,490
-绝对演技派  -影后级别的
- Pretty stellar move, huh. - To the max.

33
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,170
我的妈呀  这事
Oh my god. I've been hearing

34
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,440
你还要说多久啊
this story since we shared our mothers uterus.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,520
顺便问一句
Oh, and by the way,

36
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,040
那之后你有胆子约她吗
did you have the balls to ask her out after that?

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,750
没有...
I can't remember...

38
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,160
那是因为我没有机会
No, but only because I never had my "In".

39
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,560
-别学我说话  -别学我说话
- Don't do this! - Don't do this!

40
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,090
-拜托  -拜托...
- Come on. - Come on..

41
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,720
你怎么总是知道我要说什么
How do you always know what I'm gonna say?

42
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,310
-靠  -靠
- Fuck! - Fuck!

43
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,700
龙凤胎的心有灵犀好可怕
You guys are really freaking me out with the twins shit.

44
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,050
学着点吧  兄弟  看我怎么泡妞
Watch and learn brother. I'm going in.

45
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,970
眼神要有气势  兄弟
Eye of the tiger, buddy.

46
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,020
绝对到位
I tiger.

47
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,460
-我看没戏  -肯定没戏
- Don't like how this looks. - No, no good.

48
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,210
你喜欢听音乐吗
So uh, so you like uh, music?

49
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,110
非常讨厌
I hate it!

50
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:53,000
没戏了
Swing and a miss.

51
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,610
别来书那招  巴里
Oh, not the book Barry.

52
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,850
不  不  别提孙子兵法  天哪
No, no. not the art of war. oh god.

53
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,150
你读过孙膑写的《孙子兵法》吗
You ever read Sun Tzu's "Art of War"?

54
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,850
我这有一本  真是本好书
I have. It's amazing.

55
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,850
给你我的电话号码
Give you my number.

56
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,390
这本书就借给你了
I'll loan it to you.

57
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,540
等你有空再还给我
Get back to me, at a later date, of your choosing.

58
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:15,960
咱们还可以一起喝点津芬德尔白葡萄酒
And we'll have, I don't know, a bottle of chilled white Zin.

59
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,820
我星期六有空
I'm free on uh, Saturday.

60
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,840
打给我

64
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,830
-好啊  多莉 -你们好
- Hey Tori. - Hey guys.

65
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:11,920
一只座头鲸正从我身边游过
Whew. this humpback whale just swims right by me, right.

66
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
我这辈子都没这么害怕过
I've never felt so scared in my life.

67
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,630
太刺激了
That's when it hit me.

68
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,850
这就是我这辈子想做的事情
This is what I want to do with my life.

69
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,530
我想让别人看看
This is what I want others to see.

70
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,180
这就是为什么我一回到洛杉矶...
That's why the second I got back to LA...

71
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,130
就开了家薄荷旅行社
boom... opened Mint Travel.

72
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,230
什么  你是老板
Wait, you own it?

Yeah dude.

74
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,140
去银行借了笔钱就都搞定了
Went to the bank, got a loan. pieces fell right into place.

75
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:32,250
那你呢  我以为你去了...
So what about you, I thought you went to uh...

-麻省理工  -麻省理工
- MIT! - MIT!

77
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,750
我刚毕业  其实我不喜欢那学校
I just graduated. But uh, I hated it.

78
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,950
教的全都是很死板的机械原理
Yeah it was all like, theory and machines...

79
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,370
就好比一条单行道
I was on this one way highway...

80
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:42,440
我...
I was like...

81
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,240
停在了休息的地方
You know... rest stop, please.

82
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,910
这里就是你休息的地方吗
So this is a rest stop?

83
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,390
没错  这个工作干不了几天的
Oh yeah. this is totally temporary.

84
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:53,920
知道你该做什么吗  旅行去吧
You know what you should do? you should travel.

85
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,640
环游世界  寻找你的座头鲸
See the world. find your hump-back whale.

86
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,500
记得来找我  好吗
You come see me, ok?

87
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,990
说真的  现在是淡季
Seriously, it's the slow season right now.

88
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,490
大多数人都忙着上班或者上学
Everbody's at work or school.

89

正是你去享受的绝佳时间

Well I don't think so.

94
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,100

没错  那时你学习超级棒

每年的全勤奖都是你的
You won the attendance award... every year.

103
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,330
没错

104
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,820
-我是多莉  -麦特・富兰克林
- It's me, Tori. - Matt Franklin.

105
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,420
我就说咱们肯定认识

106
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,920
那...你现在做什么
So... er... ah... what are you up to?

109
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,990
所以我就搬回来了
So, I moved back.

110
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,940
那是家投资银行
Oh, it's an investment bank.

111
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,740
我知道
I know what it is.

112
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,500
我没别的意思...
Oh, I didn't mean to...

113
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,660
不不  没事
No no, it's fine.

114
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,850
我也是做这行的

119
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,910
我都不知道他们在洛杉矶也有分公司
I didn't know they had an office in Los Angeles.

120
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,690
我也觉得奇怪
I know, that's weird.

121
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,560
很多人都不知道
A lot of people don't.

122
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,800
我在做日本方面的收购项目
I'm in Japanese takeovers.

123

128
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,550
奇怪
Weird.

129
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:55,380
要不这样  你拿走吧  直接拿走
You know what. Just take it. Yup just take it.

130
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,020
拿走吧  等那些白痴回来我帮你付吧
There we go. I'll pay for it when this jackass gets back.

131

太好了  谢谢

哥们  你绝对想不到谁来过了
Dude, you will not believe who was just in here,

136
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,720
多莉・弗雷德金

137
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,000
说重点
Bottom line it for me.

138
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,580
她跟我眉来眼去的
I think she was flirting with me.

139
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,380
我被电晕了
I honestly got that vibe.

140

坚决不可能
That's highly unlikely.

141
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,670
能给最低价吗  老板
Can you do better for me boss?

142

151
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,540
太让人无法接受了
That's not acceptable!

152
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,260
你得打点折  老板

你父亲还好吗  巴里

所以他挺不开心的

Suncoast until I figure out what I really want to do with my life.

192

你想明白之前
Why don't you just get

193
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,880
为什么不找一份工程类的工作呢
an engineering job until you figure it out?

194

00:16:57,030 --> 00:17:01,620
向右转  抱歉
Take a right! I'm sorry.

275
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,120
你们俩的事别扯上我
I'm having no part of this.

276
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,420
对啊  巴里  咱们怎么脱身呢
Yeah Barry, I'm a little fuzzy on how we're gonna get away with this.

277
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,630
我有钥匙  门禁密码我也知道
I have a set of keys. I know all the alarm codes.

278
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,440
应该万无一失
It's almost perfectly legitimate.

279
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,110
差不多吧
Almost.

280
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,580
你留在这儿  有事就按喇叭
You just honk the horn if anything shows up.

281
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,310
收到
Roger that.

282
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,850
听着  巴里
Listen Barry.

283
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:48,690
今晚我真的不想在洛杉矶郡监狱度过
We really don't want to spend tonight in the LA county jail...

284
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,210
含泪给白人至上主义者口交
Giving some white supremacist a crying blow job.

285
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:55,240
不会的  麦特  你不会哭的
That's not gonna happen, Matt. There's no way you'd cry.

286
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,810
听我说
Look!

287
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:59,950
麦克这个混蛋销售经理把奔驰560SL
Mike the prick bastard sales manager

288
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:04,160
的钥匙放在他办公室的抽屉里
keeps the keys to the 560SL in his prick bastard desk.

289
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,120
快点  拜托  快点
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

290
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,960
这样不好吧
I don't know ??

291
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,330
完事了我们会把它送回来
We're gonna bring it back later,

292
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:12,750
没人会发觉的  好吗
nobody's gonna know the difference, okay.

293
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,140
不好吧  要是有人看见我们呢
I don't know. What if someone sees us?

294
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:15,870
那边可能装了摄像头
I think there might be security cameras.

295
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:19,160
麦特  别犹豫了  赶紧动手吧
Matt, stop thinking. Ok, we'll just do it.

296
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,080
-先去解锁  -没问题
- Shut off the alarm. - No problem.

297
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,460
操
Fuck!

298
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,690
他们改了密码  哥们
They changed the alarm codes, man.

299
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,960
那些混蛋不相信我
Those bastards didn't trust me.

300
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,460
这是为什么呢
I wonder why.

301
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,830
噢  天哪  这下完蛋了
Oh my god. holy fuck! this is great!

302
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,190
-你个缩头乌龟  快回去  -靠
- You pussy! get back in the game! - C'mon.

303
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,830
他到底在搞什么
What the hell is he doing?

304
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:43,830
要不要试试车
Test drive?

305
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,660
-我靠  -我们居然偷了辆奔驰
- Holy shit! - Stole a car! we stole a car!

306
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,160
太不可思议了
Unbelievable.

307
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:12,110
我从来没开过这车 麦特
I've never driven the 560SL before, Matt.

308
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,910
他们不让我开
They never let me.

309
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,050
哥们...还是开回去吧
Man... maybe you should take it back.

310
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:25,440
不 今晚你需要这辆车  麦特
No. you need this car tonight, Matt.

311
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,890
今晚你需要这辆车
You need this car tonight.

312
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:33,090
-多琳  -你好吗
- Doreen! - What's up?

313
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,240
告诉他们你从哪儿来的
Tell 'em where you from.

314
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,650
径直离开康普顿
Straight outta compton

315
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,150
又一个疯子黑鬼
Another crazy-ass Nigga

316
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:39,170
火药味儿闻得多了  我名号无人不晓
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger

317
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:41,530
我他妈是个混蛋  而这你都知道
I'm a bad mutha fucka and you know this

318
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:43,930
但是娘泡黑鬼他们才会扭捏躲闪
But the pussy ass niggas won't show this

319
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,430
我却不在乎  我可以自己下决断
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps

320
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:48,140
要是明文规定里没有禁止
If not from the records to jack in

321
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,320
盗窃那种废话  被定义成拿走
and craps like burglary, the definition is jackin'

322
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,630
可当我非法武装  被叫作包装
But when I'm illegally armed, it's called packin'

323
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,320
街上的混蛋
Crazy mutha fucka from the street

324
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,990
天哪
Oh my god...

325
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:11,960
你的混蛋老板车里有梳子吗
Think your prick bastard boss keeps a comb in here?

326
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,390
见鬼...
Holy...

327
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,370
你傻疯啦
Are you stupid?

328
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:30,400
-你的手在干吗  -我不知道
- What is that finger thing? - I don't know.

329
00:21:32,970 --> 00:21:36,470
-味道像阿司匹林  -我舌头麻了
- Tastes like aspirin. - My tongue is numb.

330
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,930
巴里 你太了不起了
Holy shit, Barry. that was awesome.

331
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,640

-阳光  -西服裤
- Sunshine! - Hammers!

333
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,770
感觉怎么样
Hey, how's it going ??

334
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:03,230
你们俩的互捅菊花计划怎么样了
Did you two manage to fuck each other yet?

335
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,560
-什么  -什么
- What? - What?

336
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,440
嘿  麦特  麦特・富兰克林
Oh shit, Matt. Matt Franklin.

337
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,530
还有  你们哥俩老是一起玩
And uh, your buddy your always hanging out with.

338
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:13,320
什么风把你吹来了  哥们
What's up. you never makes these things, man.

339
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,000
这就是传说中的"球"
So that's the "Ball".

340
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,450
货真价实  还能连接卫星呢
In person, live, via satellite.

341
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:21,610
-这是什么玩意啊  -嗯  了解
- You know it's not via anything, right? - Yeah, I get the point.

342
00:22:21,610 --> 00:22:23,230
他都不懂卫星是怎么连接的吧
I don't think he knows what "Via" means.

343
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:23,980
闭嘴吧
Yeah fuck you.

344
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,270
温蒂  快上来吧
Wendy get up here. C'mon baby.

345
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,940
别傻站着了  过来亲亲
Get your hot ass up here and give me a kiss.

346
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,940
小心点啊
Be careful.

347
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,940
对不起
Oh, sorry.

348
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,770
麦特  说什么呢  跟大伙说说
Ok Matt. share with everybody.

349
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,500
-没什么  -说啊  你想说什么
- Nothing. - Go ahead. what? what were you saying?

350
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,460
玩这个跟自杀差不多吧  哥们
This looks suicidal, man.

351
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,670
得了吧  你不喜欢它
C'mon. You just don't like it

352
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,730
是因为没有真枪实"蛋"吧
cause the ball represents "Balls" which you don't have.

353
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,340
凯尔
Kyle.

354
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:52,150
-你是在暗示我什么吗 -麦特
- Oh, is this one of those "Metaphors"? - Matt!

355
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:54,560
温迪  没关系  我懂
Wendy, no. I got this one.

356
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,860
没错  哥是暗示了
Yeah, yeah, it's a metaphor.

357
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:01,670
这就是个球
So the "Ball" Is...  Balls!

358
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,090
不错
Good one.

359
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:11,070
-这是  -暗示而已  给他个下马威

休想跑出我的手掌心
Do not go anywhere.

362
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,010
眼镜挺潮啊  臭小子
Nice shades, asshole!

363
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,960
没有看到弗雷德金啊
No sign of the Frederking.

364
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:08,780
我感觉自己又回到10年级了
Man I feel like I'm in 10th grade again.

365
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,600
我先去把酒冰镇一下
I'm gonna put these on ice.

366
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,760
嘿  富兰克林
Hey Franklin.

367
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,720
-我在这儿呢  -我操
- Down here Hans Solo. - Ah, fuck!

368
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,990
卡洛斯  你怎么了
Carlos, what happened to you?

369
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,810
67乘365得多少
67 times 365?

370
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:22,300
-你怎么在轮椅上  -回答我
- You're in a wheelchair. - Answer!

Uh... 24455. what's up?

372
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,340
我懒得走  开个玩笑
I've been really lazy. Just kidding.

373
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,620
毕业之后我遭遇了酒驾
I got hit by a drunk driver right after graduation, but...

374
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,810
也算是因祸得福吧
"Don't cry for me Argentina" It's not so bad,

375
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:33,520
停车位比以前好找了  女人也不缺
I get better parking, tons of pussy.

376
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,360

I mean I have stronger opinions about hills now but, whatever.

377

-你根本不在高盛  -你在高盛
- You don't work there! - You work at Goldman Sachs?

383
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,200
我发誓
You bet your legs I do.

384
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,430
你觉得我身残智也残了吗
Think I'm gonna let this shit hold me back?

385
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:57,960
炒汇又不用走路
You don't need to walk to speculate currencies.

386
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,280
我说了做炒汇的不用走路
I said "You don't need to walk to speculate currencies"!

Probably not gonna work either. we don't have an LA office.

395

如果我没泡到妞儿的话
If I'm not gettin laid.

398
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,980
有妞儿了就顾不过来了
When I'm gettin laid I don't think about much else.

399
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,480
和你聊天真是浪费时间
Anyway, kinda gettin bummed out talking to you.

你们能让开点吗  别碍老子的事
Will you guys move. I'm trying to fucking party here.

406
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,250
凯尔的疯奶奶站在那边说
And it's Kyles crazy grandma,

407
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,460
你们听着
standing there. And she says, listen to this...

408
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,900
不管你们是在做爱还是要淹死了
I can't tell if your fucking or drowning.

409
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,140
都已经影响我休息了
But neither one is letting me get any sleep.

410
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,030
好丢人啊
So embarrassing.

411
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:07,590
第二天  我爸把我叫到一边
So, uh, the next day, my dad pulls me aside...

412
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,960
他给了我一笔买公寓首付的钱
...and he offers to help with the down payment on a condo.

413
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:14,840
稀里糊涂成为有房一族了
Yeah, so I guess we screwed ourselves into the market.

414
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,730
差不多吧
Literally.

415
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:26,010
我们星期二就要搬过去了
Yeah, anyway so we're moving in on Tuesday,

416
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,690
那房子不错  还有个大浴缸
and... but it's great cause there's a hot tub...

417
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:49,550
我受不了了  给我来点可卡因
Hi. I can't handle this right now. I want to do some of the coke.

418
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:50,660
你受不了什么了
What do you mean you can't handle this?

419
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,260
我想要吸可卡因
I want to do the coke!

420
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,120
不  我是问你受不了什么了
No, what can't you handle?

421
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,390
没有可卡因抽
Not doing the coke!

422
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:58,290
巴里  我们不是瘾君子
Ok, Barry, we're not cocaine people.

423
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:02,840
首先  我爸是警察  其次  我认为
A, My dad's a cop. B, I'm defining my gray area...

424
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,140
我再颓废也不会碰毒品的
...which I'm pretty sure doesn't include hard narcotics.

425
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,280
-给我  -不
- Give me the bag. - No.

426
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,950
不给我就别想要车钥匙
Give me the bag or you don't get the car keys.

427
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,740
好吧  别吸过量
Okay, just take it easy "Scarf ace."

428
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,850
这是车钥匙
This one here is an alarm...

429
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:04,420
-多莉・弗雷德金  -瑞克・赫林顿  天哪
- Tori Frederking? - Rick Herrington. Oh my god.

430
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:07,520
-最近怎么样  -还好
- How are you? - I'm good... wow... oh.

431
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,510
你怎么样
Hey, how are you?

432
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,200
最近怎么样  见到你很高兴
What's up man? good to see you.

433
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:23,850
我俩正收拾东西呢  下星期搬到一起住
Dude and I we're just packing up. moving in together next week.

434
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,400
-我们买了套公寓  -恩  跟他们说说
- We got a condo. - Yeah, baby tell them the story.

435
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,090
7月4号那天家里来了很多人
We're here 4th of July.

436
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:30,770
我们家总搞派对
My family always has the big party here,

437
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:33,900
亲戚们都来了  我们都没地方亲热了
and the house is packed with relatives and so there's no place for us too...

438
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,370
-嗯  -你知道?
- I know. - You know?

439
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:38,790
于是我们就跑到游泳池里
So we come down to the pool,

440
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:40,440
那儿很安静的
where it's always kinda quiet, right.

441
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,810
跳进去的时候 水都溅出来了
You know, getting into it, water splashing...

442
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,070
好尴尬啊
So embarrassing.

443
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,140
突然有个救生圈砸到我头上了
A flotation ring hits me in the head.

444
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,010
我就像一个水泵
And I'm like mid pump, its like... what?

445
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,190
原来是我奶奶  她说
And I look and it's my crazy grandmother and she says to me...

446
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,390
我不知道你在做爱还是要淹死了
...I can't tell if you're fucking or drowning,

447
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,400
都已经影响我休息了
but neither one is letting us get any sleep.

448
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:02,960
第二天  我爸爸把我们叫到一边
Next day, dad pulls us aside and

449
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,830
给了我一笔买公寓首付的钱
offers to help with a down payment on the condo.

450
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,670
我们稀里糊涂得就成有房一族了
Yeah so I guess we screwed ourselves into the market.

451
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,640
很有意思
That's good.

452
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,340
嘿  麦特你还记得多莉吧
Hey, um, Matt you remember Tori.

459
00:29:43,630 --> 00:29:45,630
然后呢
How's that?

460
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:53,120

别再打了  哥们  过来
Don't do it again, white boy. Here.

540
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,700
真该死  巴里
God damn it, Barry.

541
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,090
你还好吧  天哪  她噎住了
Are you OK? Oh my god she's choking.

542
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:37,280
快来帮帮她
Somebody help her.

543
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,780
我来帮她  我来帮你  呼气  呼气
I got her. I got you. Breathe... breathe...

544
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,280
放下她
Get off her.

545
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,080
没事的别怕
You're gonna pull through.

546
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,670
-加油  呼气  -你在做什么
- C'mon! Breathe! - What are you doing?

547
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:54,860
-我在帮你啊  -不是我噎到了  是她
- I'm giving you the Heimlich. - I wasn't choking. she was.

548
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:08,570
对不起  我就是个笨蛋
I'm such a jackass. I'm sorry.

549
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:14,740
我搞砸了  我在做什么  对不起
I suck at this. I'm... I'm... what am I doing? I'm sorry!

550
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:18,380
你是女神  我癞蛤蟆想吃天鹅肉
You're awesome. I'm trying so hard, and I... it's...

551
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:21,820
实话说吧  从高中我就开始喜欢你了
Here's the thing. You were my high school crush, by the way.

552
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,000
我刚刚却在这么多人面前
And I just physically

553
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,840
让你难堪
assaulted you in front of a bunch of people.

554
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:28,440
我完蛋了  别介意
I just hit rock bottom. So... don't mind me.

555
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,170
-真的吗  -是啊
- Really? - Oh, yeah.

556
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:32,950
还能更糟糕点吗  不会了
I don't see how it could get any worse. Nope! Got it!

557
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:37,150
我邀请你跳舞  然后把酒吐到你脸上
I could ask you to dance and, chuck my drink in your face...

558
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:40,070
并把你甩到该死的墙上  我做的出来
And twirl you into the fucking wall. I'll do it.

559
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,800
对不起  其实我
I'm sorry... I was...

560
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,480
我喜欢这曲子
Oh I love this song!

561
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:52,080
我喜欢这曲子
I love this song.

562
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,910
-你想  想跳舞吗  -当然
- Do you wanna... do you wanna dance? - Sure!

563
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:59,770
你确定
Are you insured?

564
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,450
如果你保证不乱转  我就和你跳
I will dance with you if you promise, no twirling.

565
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,360
好吧  我保证  我慢慢跳
Right, I promise. I'll go slow.

566
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:32,500
-你能不能把你的号码给我  -什么
- I was wondering, uh... if I could get your phone... - What?

567
00:39:34,990 --> 00:39:38,260
我能不能...
I was wondering if I could... I could, uh...

568
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,510
上高中的时候我就想告诉你
I could always tell in high school,

569
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,250
我会一直做你的护身符
um, that you were gonna land on your feet.

570
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,730
女士们先生们  大家好
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could get your attention please.

571
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:58,080
首先我想说
First of all I want to say

572
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,770
感谢你们能来和我一起度过
thank you to everybody for chillin with me...

573
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,840
我的最后一个单身派对
...on my very last labor day party.

574
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:09,230
自从毕业之后大家都没怎么变
You know nothings changed it seems like since we graduated.

575
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,170
特雷沃  说你呢
Trevor, talking to you.

576
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,690
你那个该死的耳环是怎么回事
What's up with that fucking ear ring, dude?

577
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:16,940
我们长大了  成熟了
We are changing, and we're moving on.

578
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,490
大家都各奔东西了
We're going our separate ways.

579
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:23,650
我们中的一些人即将走到一起
And some of us are going our separate ways... together.

580
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,030
大家都认识温蒂吧
You all know Wendy.

581
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:26,440
这是温蒂・富兰克林
Wendy Franklin here.

582
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,470
-亲爱的上这来  -你要干什么
- Honey get on up here. - What are you doing?

583
00:40:28,470 --> 00:40:29,620
他要干什么
What is he doing?

584
00:40:34,970 --> 00:40:38,320
她是个不错的女孩
I think that she is... one hell of a chick.

585
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,820
是他把我这样的渣子变成了钻石
Because she turned a lump of coal like me into a diamond.

586
00:40:45,310 --> 00:40:47,860
她让我充满了压力
From all the pressure she put me under. Oh!

587
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,160
等下  我这里有样东西
Oh, wait. There's something I got here.

588
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,240
-哦  天哪  -哦  天哪
- Oh my god! - Oh my god!

589
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,420
温蒂  你愿意嫁给我吗
Wendy, will you marry me?

590
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:12,950
-不愿意  -当然
- No! - Hell yeah!

591
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,120
是的  我愿意
Yes, yes I will.

592
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,250
老兄  悠着点
Oh man, come on!

593
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,720
我知道大家都在嘲笑你
Look, I know everyone's making fun of you.

594
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,400
但我只是想说
But I just want to say I

595
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,080
我很喜欢你今晚做的事
really loved what you did out there tonight.

596
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:27,090
谁在嘲笑我
Who's making fun of me?

597
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:31,740
你跳的很帅  感觉是在示威
Your dance was cool. It was like anti-dancing.

598
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:38,020
你给了那些混蛋上了一课
It was like a big screw you to all them conformist assholes.

599
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:39,880
我很高兴你能喜欢
I'm glad you liked it.

600
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,180
你没有给机会让他们得瑟
You didn't give a shit about any of their shit, you know.

601
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,880
你想把衣服脱光吗
Did you want to get naked?

602
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:51,590
这也太快了  虽然我喜欢裸体
Wow, that was fast. For me I get naked all the time.

603
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,260
等下过来找我
Come find me later.

604
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,880
我能和你说几句话吗
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

605
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,270
我不想说这些  但我真的感到
I don't wanna say this, but I really feel...

606
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:17,930
那就别说了
Then don't!

607
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:19,020
别和他结婚
Don't marry him.

608
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,700
-上帝啊  -你们两个
- Oh, christ. - The two of you...

609
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:25,030
你们两个不合适  他不能给你幸福
It's like you don't fit. I don't think he can make you happy.

610
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:28,170
我已经很幸福了  你错了  赶紧走吧
Well I already am happy, so your wrong so leave me alone.

611
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:30,090
那你为什么看剑桥大学的来信
Then why don't you open that envelope from Cambridge?

612
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:32,020
因为我怕被拒绝
Because I hate rejection.

613
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,490
得了吧  你知道你被录取了
Come on. You know you got in!

614
00:43:33,490 --> 00:43:34,720
你也知道他不想让你走
And you know he doesn't want you to go.

615
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,670
他已经在拖你后腿了
He's already holding you back.

616
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,960
凯尔会支持我做的任何决定
Kyle would support any decision

617
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,710
只要我开心
that I wanted to make as long as I was happy.

618
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,540
好吧  那你为什么不告诉他你被录取了
Ok then, why didn't you tell him you applied?

619
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:42,280
他都要成你的丈夫了
I mean he's gonna be your husband,

620
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,070
你不该对他隐瞒吧
right? Aren't you supposed to be honest with him by everything?

621
00:43:44,070 --> 00:43:47,510
你在给我上诚实课吗  高盛先生
Oh you're lecturing me about honesty, Mister "Goldman Sachs"?

622
00:43:47,510 --> 00:43:48,440
你说了这么多无非是
The only reason you're

623
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,870
因为你嫉妒
saying all this stuff is because you're jealous.

624
00:43:49,870 --> 00:43:51,980
你嫉妒我拥有了你想要而没有的生活
You're jealous that I have a life and you don't!

625
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:52,970
那是他的生活
You're not gonna have a life.

626
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:54,730
你只是他生活中的配角
You're just supporting Kyle's life.

627
00:43:54,730 --> 00:43:56,100
这就是你答应求婚的原因  对吗
That's why you said yes, right?

628
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,150
别自欺欺人了
So it would all be wrapped up in a little bow.

629
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,880
温蒂  婚姻是人生的重大决定
Wendy, marriage is a big life decision.

630
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,940
人生重大决定  至少我比某些混蛋强
Oh, big life decisions? at least I'm making some asshole.

631
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,100
你那么懦弱  优柔寡断
You're so scared, you can't choose anything.

632
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,060
女朋友 工作  你都拿不定主意
Not a girl, not a job... anything.

633
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,010
你只会活在自己的梦里
And you're just gonna sit there in your little...

634
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:10,350
幻想着不切实际的东西
...smarty pants fantasy bubble, dreaming about...

635
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,880
意淫着你不可能到手的多莉・弗雷德金
Tori Frederking when you know that she's unobtainable.

636
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,910
不是这样的
That's not true.

637
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:15,420
你得不到她  你自己心里明白
You can't get her and you know it.

638
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,590
这样你就不用争取了  对吧
So there's really no risk at all, is there?

639
00:44:17,590 --> 00:44:19,420
都是狗屎  麦特  你心里清楚
It's bullshit, Matt and you know it!

640
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:26,480
好吧  是我错了  你会过得很好的
I was wrong. You're gonna look great in an apron.

641
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,620
你知道我是如何一直追随时尚的
So you know how I've always been into fashion.

642
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,240
我坐货车去了纽约
Well I am in a van to New York.

643
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:57,540
-你都不惊讶吗 -非常震惊
- Doesn't that so blow your mind? - Totally.

644
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:59,850
我们去德雷克塞尔的派对吧
Let's go to the Drexel party.

645
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:01,700
咱们怎么还和高盛先生纠缠呢
Why are we still hanging out with the Sachs?

646
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,780
我们还没找到正式工作呢
Some of us weren't offered full time positions.

647
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,790
还得去多交际交际呢
I have some serious networking to do.

648
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:07,530
这根本就不是我的风格  好吧
This is so totally not me, ok.

649
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:09,760
我觉得咱们可以出去做点别的
I totally think we can work something out.

650
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:11,630
只是今晚
Just for tonight.

651
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:13,190
谢莉
Shelly!

652
00:45:13,190 --> 00:45:14,310
我要走了
I gotta go.

653
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,170
我完全不知道我在说什么
I totally don't know what I'm talking about.

654
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,620
这是你的车吗
Is that your car?

655
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,540
这车的颜色真好看
This is the so cherry.

656
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:45,010
你都买得起这种车了
You make enough money for a car like this?

657
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,950
反正我把它开走的时候没人拦着我
Nobody stopped me when I drove it off the lot.

658
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:55,220
麦特  麦特  麦特
Matt! Matt! Matt!

659
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:00,930
这是巴里  那个斗舞的
This is Barry... the dancer.

660
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,240
你们去比弗利山庄的派对吗
So are you guys going to that party in Beverly Hills?

661
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:12,210
考虑考虑  你呢
Uh, yeah, we're thinking about it. you?

662
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:17,190
-我去啊  -那个派对在哪儿来着
- Well yeah! - Where is that party again?

663
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:19,470
我正好知道怎么走
Well you know what. I know the way

664
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:22,430
要不你开车带我过去吧
so I should just, ride with you.

665
00:46:22,430 --> 00:46:24,600
-什么  -天哪  你这小贱人
- What? - Oh my god, you slut.

666
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,570
天哪  你这小贱人
Oh my god, you slut.

667
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:29,850
你得坐她朋友的车了
Look, you gotta ride with her friends.

668
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,490
-是吗  好啊  -抽烟干吗
- Really? ok. - Are you smoking now?

669
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,720
瘾头来了挡也挡不住  是吗  老兄
When it rains it pours. am I right, brother?

670
00:46:40,850 --> 00:46:45,400
来  击个拳  击拳  然后握紧
Come on, punch it up. punch. and squeeze real tight.

671
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,340
再把手指伸出来
And then the finger comes up. Bam!

672
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,520
-然后再这样  -好了  别闹了
- And then you go like this. - Hey, get off me.

673
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:59,100
-我和你们一起去吧  -还是不要了
- Hey, I guess I'm riding with you guys. - Uh, I don't know.

674
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:01,170
我有可卡因哦
I have cocaine on me.

675
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,480
不如一起坐后面吧  巴里
Can I ride in the back with you Barry?

676
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,570
那个派对应该挺好玩的
Well this will be fun. It will be all

677
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:12,840
派对上都是金融界的  我们能认识很多人
bankers at this party, so we will know a ton of people.

678
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,860
太好了
Oh, great.

679
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,750
今晚天气很好啊
It's a great night for this, huh?

680
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,340
那是我老板皮特・贝令办的派对
So this party is at my boss, Pete Bering's house.

681
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,140
他很色
Unfortunately he's a bit of a perve.

682
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,450
我打包票  他之所以聘用我
Swear to god the only reason

683
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,460
让我在德崇证券上班
I got offered a full time position at Drexel...

684
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,840
是因为他想看我的咪咪
... is cause he wants to see my boobs.

685
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,890
真的吗
Really?

686
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,260
-那你朋友的呢  -他早看过了
- What about your friends boobs? - Well, he's already seen them.

687
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:15,000
是吗
Really? Wow!

688
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:17,040
这就是问题所在
You see that's the problem.

689
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,670
一旦让他看到我的咪咪  我就被动了
Boob power recedes once revealed.

690
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:22,120
他没看过也不会看到我的咪咪
He hasn't and won't see mine,

691
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:24,140
所以我还掌握着咪咪主动权
so I retain the boob power.

692
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,270
往哪儿看呢  麦特
Eye contact, Matt.

693
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:30,640
我太了解你们男人的想法了
You know we always know when you guys look.

694
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,650
-不一定吧  -是真的
- Not always. - No, we do, it's true!

695
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:37,010
来吧  试试  我把头转过去
Go ahead, give it a shot. I'll look away.

696
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,460
看了吧
Now.

697
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:46,920
-好厉害  -厉害吧
- That was good. - Pretty good?

698
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:52,050
-看了吧  -太神奇了
- Now. - Wow, that's crazy.

699
00:48:52,050 --> 00:48:54,660
怎么回事  是你运气太好了吧
I don't know. I think maybe you're just getting lucky.

700
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:57,540
是吗  再试一次  来真的
Oh really? try it again, big shot.

701
00:48:59,970 --> 00:49:01,800
-看了吧  -你太神了
- Now. - Wow, that is a gift!

702
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:06,460
不可思议啊  不如七局四胜吧
That's unbelievable. best of seven?

703
00:49:31,830 --> 00:49:33,830
我的神啊  看见那车了吗
Holy shit, did you see that car?

704
00:50:02,380 --> 00:50:03,880
你们好吗
How are you guys?

705
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:12,930
这样的话股市会反弹
It'll cause the stock to rally.

706
00:50:12,930 --> 00:50:15,050
我担心他们越赚越多
But I'm worried about them sustaining these margins.

707
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,690
最近关于俄罗斯油田的传闻很多
The rumors about this Russian oil field.

708
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,220
这是肯定的事  它有上涨的势头
It's going to happen because it's got momentum.

709
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,130
资金负债表里看不出来涨不涨
But you can't put momentum on a balance sheet.

710
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,090
我是说  他们的资金状况很令人堪忧
I mean, their numbers are embarrassing.

711
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:23,560
这无所谓  我们可以发行一些垃圾股
That's irrelevant. we'll float some junk

712
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,190
这样他们就可以买一个资产负债表
and then they can buy a company with a balance sheet...

713
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,340
不那么差的公司了
...that's not absolute shit.

714
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:28,960
沃尔特  你怎么没喝酒
Walter, your not drinking.

715
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,040
说好要喝的  不好意思
I warned you about that. excuse me.

716
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,290
-你好啊  多莉  -你好  白令先生
- Hello Tori. - Hey Mr. Bering.

717
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:34,860
叫我皮特 我正等你呢
Hey, it's Pete. please.

718
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:38,420
咱们边走边聊  如何
I was really hoping you'd come. walk with me. Excuse me.

719
00:50:39,790 --> 00:50:42,270
-贝斯也来了吧  -没注意
- I think Beth's here. - Didn't notice.

720
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:44,820
多莉  我想听听你是怎么看待
Listen Tori. I was hoping to get your

721
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:48,780
波罗的海英镑的现状的
opinion on the actualities of that Baltic Sterling nonsense.

722
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,100
能不能上楼去说
Would you mind coming upstairs.

723
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,290
帮我分析分析报告
Take a look at that report. decode it for me.

724
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:57,990
是皮特吗  皮特・白令
It's Pete, right? Pete Bering.

725
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:01,490
我是麦特・富兰克林  很高兴又见到你了
Matt Franklin. good to see you again.

726
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,380
不好意思  我们之前见过面吗
I'm sorry, have we met?

727
00:51:03,380 --> 00:51:04,380
之前见过面吗
Have we met?

728
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:17,320
-麦特在高盛工作  -不敢当  请多多指教
- Matt's over at Goldman Sachs. - Guilty, as charged.

729
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,900
麦特  你老板是谁
So, Matt. who do you work under over there?

730
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:23,130
噢  这个我不太方便透露
Oh, well... I'm not at liberty to say.

731
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:26,430
-为什么  -公司有规定的
- Why not? - We pride ourselves on being a discreet firm.

732
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:28,930
我们的规定是不在公共场合讨论工作的事
Our policy is don't discuss business.

733
00:51:28,930 --> 00:51:32,260
是吗  麦特不像是高盛的人嘛  多莉
Really. Matt doesn't seem like a Goldman Sachs man to me, Tori.

734
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,640
那些吹牛大王讲起工作来总是滔滔不绝
Most of those blowhards can't shut up about work.

735
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:39,860
说真的  麦特  你在哪个部门
Seriously, Matt, tell me the department, let me do the math.

736
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:41,070
我认识很多你们公司的人
I know a lot of people over there.

737
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:47,070
-哪个部门嘛  -是啊  麦特  你是做什么的
- What department? - Yeah Matt. What...do...you...do?

738
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,410
不好意思
Excuse me.

739
00:51:52,350 --> 00:51:54,490
日元  你知道吗
Do you guys know Yen? I mean...

740
00:51:57,510 --> 00:52:05,510
如果和古田先生星期一从东京的银行
Say a Yen gets uh transferred from Mr. Nariyada's bank, in Tokyo...

741
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:08,930
转账1日元到罗马银行
...on a Monday and it lands in Rome.

742
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:12,820
那么0.467乘以32
So what's .467 * 32?

743
00:52:12,820 --> 00:52:16,510
就约等于149.5里拉  对吗
149.5 Lira, right?

744
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,310
然后又从罗马转到大英帝国
Wam, Mr. Roma takes that, flips it over to Mr. Queen Elizabeth...

745
00:52:19,330 --> 00:52:21,830
那么149.5除以22.3就等于
...so what's 149.5 divided by 22.3?

746
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:25,330
6英磅78便士是吗
Six pounds, British Sterling and 78 pence, right?

747
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:29,110
紧接着又在今天开盘前转到美国账户
Wam! He takes it, flips it over to Mr. USA today before opening bell...

748
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:31,480
所以6.78除以1.68
So what's 6.78 divided by 1.68?

749
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,790
就应该是3.99美元
It's 3.99 big bad dream bags.

750
00:52:33,790 --> 00:52:35,320
然后美国人又把钱汇给了
And guess who Mr. Yankee Doodle Dandy

751
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,350
另一个时区的谷田先生
wires it to over the international date line... Mr. Nariyada.

752
00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,460
请问1日元现在价值多少
How much is that Yen worth now?

753
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:39,490
1.012
1.012!

754
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,870
一天里升值了1.2%  乘以365天
1.2 percent more in one day. 1.2 percent times 365 days...

755
00:52:42,870 --> 00:52:46,770
我就是计算这个的  棘手得很
... and I'll do the math. that's a lot of fuckin blow fish.

756
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,140
我就是做这个的  皮特
So that's what I do, Pete.

757
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,890
是在聊外汇吗  富兰克林
Currencies, Franklin?

758
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,320
是啊  卡洛斯
Yeah Carlos.

759
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:58,580
你们俩一个部门的吗
You two in the same division?

760
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,870
富兰克林  麦特
Franklin? Matt?

761
00:53:05,780 --> 00:53:08,860
我开玩笑的  麦特可是我们部门的红人
I'm just fucking with you. Matt's a star man.

762
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,260
不爱搭理人
It's like having rain man on the floor.

763
00:53:10,260 --> 00:53:11,790
除非你去摸他  在他身上拉屎
Except you can touch him and shit.

764
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:14,590
他最近还升职了呢
In fact, he just got promoted.

765
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:18,080
是啊  我想低调点的
That's right. I didn't want to say anything.

766
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,980
我的上司被炒了
Guy above me got fired.

767
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:22,760
有个姑娘想升职  他就让那姑娘给他打手枪
Some girl asked him for a raise and he asked for a hand job.

768
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:24,830
说不定他就是这样升上去的
I guess he's the one that got the raise, huh.

769
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,080
有我的风格
Sounds like my kind of guy.

770
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,140
她向法庭起诉索赔八百万
She took him for about 8 Mil.

771
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:38,250
如今法院对性骚扰 判得非常非常严
Supreme Court takes sexual harassment very, very seriously these days.

772
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,340
还是收敛点吧
It's about time, huh?

773
00:53:41,770 --> 00:53:47,570
是啊是啊  应该的
Yes, yes, it is about time.

774
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:50,770
很高兴认识你  我去那边转转
Well. Great meeting you, Matt. I have to go make the rounds.

775
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:52,930
你们玩得开心点
You guys have fun.

776
00:53:54,770 --> 00:53:57,270
天哪  你太牛了
Holy shit, that was amazing.

777
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,640
淡定  红发尤物来了
Stay cool. sexy redhead.

778
00:54:31,770 --> 00:54:37,270
-特里斯・安德森  -巴里・内森
- Trish Anderson. - Barry Nathan.

779
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:40,460
下雪了吗
Is it snowing?

780
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,670
外面差不多有65度
I think it's like 65 degrees outside.

781
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:47,780
我的意思是  你带东西了吗
No I mean are you holding?

782
00:54:49,710 --> 00:54:51,180
带了带了
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

783
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:56,440
-想找点乐子吗  -那是当然
- You want to have fun little? - Yes I do!

784
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:00,090
-跟我来  -真的吗  天哪
- Come with me. - Really? Oh my god.

785
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:08,030
天哪
Oh my god.

786
00:55:08,530 --> 00:55:10,280
不好意思  把你的也吸了
Oops, I did yours.

787
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,470
我的老天爷
Jesus christ, man.

788
00:55:15,470 --> 00:55:18,230
这是我朋友弗朗西斯  自己人
it's my friend Frances. It's ok though. Isn't it?

789
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:23,020
那好  进来吧老兄
Ok, come on in man.

790
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,560
你想来点吗  未来战士
You want any, future man?

791
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,860
靠近点  巴里・内森
Come a little closer, Barry Nathan.

792
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,260
比弗利山果然名不虚传
Beverly Hills.

793
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,920
弗朗西斯  帮我个忙
Hey Frances, um... do me a favor.

794
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:58,660
嗑点儿然后就走吧  好吗
Just take yours to go. Ok pal? Just go!

795
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,760
-滚出去  -他不吸
- Get the hell outta here. - He doesn't want any of that.

796
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:02,760
不要吗
He doesn't?

797
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,760
-那他要什么  -他想看着咱们
- What the hell does Frances want? - He wants to watch.

798
00:56:11,750 --> 00:56:14,050
他不会打扰我们的  让他看吧
He won't bother us. Just let him watch.

799
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:17,370
好吧  这个弗朗西斯是何方神圣啊
Ok, um... who is this Frances person?

800
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:18,750
你没必要知道
It's non-negotiable!

801
00:56:29,750 --> 00:56:31,750
来吧
I'm going to try this.

802
00:56:36,750 --> 00:56:38,250
这房子花了他不少钱吧
What do you think this house cost him?

803
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:41,660
瘾君子  小孩都有心理问题
Drug habit. Kids in therapy.

804
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,750
小心人多嘴杂
Hey The view.

805
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,250
但你还是喜欢  是吗
But you like it, right?

806
00:56:47,750 --> 00:56:51,590
当然  必须的  德崇证券是个好公司
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Drexel's great.

807
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:53,550
是个求之不得的好机会
It's a real opportunity for me.

808
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,650
我有公司股份  福利也好
I'll get stock options, great benefits.

809
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:59,250
真是个非常好的...
You know it's really a wonderful...

810
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,750
什么
What?

811
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,750
我讨厌它
I hate it!

812
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:10,250
我讨厌我的工作
I hate my job!

813
00:57:11,750 --> 00:57:14,880
我从未大声说过这种话
Wow, I've never said that out loud before.

814
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,400
但这是事实  我真的讨厌它
But I do, I hate it. I do!

815
00:57:19,090 --> 00:57:20,730
我讨厌这一切
I hate all of this.

816
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:21,820
-真的吗  -太讨厌了
- Really? - Hate it!

817
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,000
-看出来了  -很不可思议吧
- Gotcha. - Crazy right?

818
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:27,180
我总是在想  我是真心喜欢这行吗
I just keep thinking, do I really want to do this?

819
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,710
我的人生难道就这样了吗
Is this what I want to do with my life?

820
00:57:29,710 --> 00:57:30,470
那要怎样呢
Is it?

821
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:32,010
我不知道  问题就在这里
I do not know, that's the thing.

822
00:57:32,010 --> 00:57:35,720
我很困惑  不知何去何从
I'm so confused and I really, really don't know.

823
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,430
你肯定觉得这很可笑
I'm sorry this must sound ridiculous to you.

824
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:42,340
你那么精明能干
You're obviously very smart at your job.

825
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:43,840
才不是呢  多莉
No, no, Tori. Whoa!

826
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:48,560
你别开玩笑了  我了解自己的长处
Are you kidding me? I got this thing that I know I'm good at.

827
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:49,780
身边的人都希望
And everyone in my life...

828
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,470
我能利用这一点去找工作
...expects me to turn it into a career.

829
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,450
我受不了
I can't stand it.

830
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,510
我明白  我能体会你的感受
I know. I feel the exact same way every day.

831
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:00,960
没有退路了
And then there's no turning back!

832
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,270
诸如成家立业之类的
It's gonna be like uh, family and mortgage.

833
00:58:04,270 --> 00:58:05,560
-没有退路  -是啊
- There's no way to quit. - Yes!

834
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:06,360
-被套住了  -被套住了
- It's a trap! - It's a trap!

835
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,640
老天  这真是遭透了
God, that sounds so messed up.

836
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:21,380
你玩过鸡巴游戏吗
Have you ever played the penis game?

837
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:26,380
我对这个没兴趣  谢谢
I'm not prepared to reveal that information, thank you.

838
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,280
不  就是个游戏
No, it's a real game.

839
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:30,380
我先用很小的声音说鸡巴这个词
I say the word "Penis" like really quiet...

840
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:32,850
你说的时候声音要比我大
And then you say it just a little bit louder.

841
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,880
然后我的声音要比你大
Then I say it a little bit louder than that...

842
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:36,530
谁先停下谁就输
And the first to stop saying it, loses.

843
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:39,090
准备好了吗  这很简单  鸡巴
Are you ready? Is easy. penis

844
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:40,740
这...
I don't know...

845
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:41,870
多莉相信我
Tori trust me.

846
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:44,780
这比干那些无聊的工作好玩多了
There is nothing more fun than a job you don't give a shit about losing.

847
00:58:46,730 --> 00:58:48,380
鸡巴
Penis.

848
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,890
-鸡巴  -鸡巴
- Penis. - Penis.

849
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,540
-鸡巴  -鸡巴
- Penis! - Penis!

850
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:55,070
-鸡巴  -鸡巴
- Penis!! - Penis!!

851
00:58:55,070 --> 00:58:57,520
-鸡巴  -鸡巴
- penis!!! - penis!!!

852
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,500
平手
Let's call it a tie.

853
00:59:05,450 --> 00:59:08,030
天哪  你有点过了  女士
Chris, christ, you're out of control,lady

854
00:59:08,030 --> 00:59:09,150
是啊  你也一样
Yeah, fuck you too!

855
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,490
-什么  不好意思  -别跟我道歉
- What? Sorry. - Don't apologize to me.

856
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:12,550
你又不是我儿子
What? You are my child?

857
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,900
-干翻你  -这才像话
- Fuck you then. - Yeah, that's better.

858
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:20,560
我要把你的老二整个儿吞下去
I'm gonna swallow you whole... son.

859
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:23,650
你愿意的话  求之不得
If you don't mind, that would be fantastic.

860
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:31,390
我是说  吃我的鸡巴  你个  贱货
I mean, um... suck my dick... bitch?

861
00:59:31,390 --> 00:59:33,470
这就对了
Yeah. That's it!

862
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:43,910
我要动真格的了  巴里・内森
I'm gonna hit it with you, Barry Nathan.

863
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:46,660
等一下
Wait a minute!

864
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:56,390
妈的他在干嘛
Hey, what the hell is he doing?

865
00:59:56,390 --> 00:59:57,650
他在找最佳观赏角度
Oh he's getting a better angle.

866
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,220
-好吧  别让他靠近我  -那是多近
- Ok, he can't come near me! - How close?

867
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,640
我可不想让他碰我
I don't want him touching me at all.

868
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:07,130
让我离开这儿
Let me outta here!

869
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,320
怎么  你不喜欢这样吗
What, you don't like this?

870
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,060
当然不
Shit no!

871
01:00:11,150 --> 01:00:12,880
你这个疯婆娘
You crazy bitch.

872
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,590
来啊  大点声 巴里
Yeah c'mon. Shout at me Barry!

873
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,670
我要杀了你
I'll kill you!

874
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,130
变态  我没上过大学  行了吧
People... freaky shit! I didn't go to college, ok!

875
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,300
你们今天玩的过分了
You people crossed the line here today!

876
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:34,300
这就是个陷阱  多谢你们的好意
This is entrapment! No thank you!

877
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,480
去隔壁看看怎么样
God it's like, who lives in this neighborhood, right?

878
01:00:41,660 --> 01:00:43,850
等等
Actually, hang on a sec.

879
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:49,620
你喜欢在院子里蹦蹦跳跳吗
How do you feel about a little yard hopping?

880
01:00:50,970 --> 01:00:53,420
-不知道  -快点  跟我来
- I don't know. - C'mon, let's get out of here.

881
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:00,620
天哪
Oh my god!

882
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,060
好像没人在家
I don't think anyone's home.

883
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:07,560
是吗
Really?

884
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:09,660
欢迎来到你的新家
Welcome to your new house.

885
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:14,260
你怎么这么有趣  我同事都不如你
How are you like this? no one else I work with is this much fun.

886
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:16,280
真不相信是搞投资的
I can't believe you're a banker.

887
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:19,560
我也不相信
Me neither...

888
01:01:23,060 --> 01:01:25,330
-不是吧  -怎么了
- Oh shit. - What?

889
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:26,530
太棒了
Oh yeah.

890
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,390
我们来玩蹦床吧
We're doing this.

891
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:32,970
我才不要蹦这玩意儿
I am not getting on that thing.

892
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:36,950
动作很熟练啊
That was really smooth.

893
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:39,080
-来吧  -不要
- Come on. - No, I'm not.

894
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:39,940
我知道你想玩
I know you want to.

895
01:01:39,940 --> 01:01:42,580
我就看着你玩
I'll watch safely from down here.

896
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,500
多莉  想做就做  别想太多
Tori tonight we're not thinking. we're doing.

897
01:01:59,860 --> 01:02:01,650
我刚好想起来
This is just coming back to me.

898
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:05,740
你还记得我们玩真心话大冒险吗
Do you remember when we played Truth or Dare?

899
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:09,570
你跟我  天堂7分钟
I think you and I got dared into 7 minutes in heaven.

900
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,720
不记得了
No doesn't ring a bell

901
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:18,890
我们可以再玩一次
But maybe if we play it again...

902
01:02:19,150 --> 01:02:22,390
你想玩真心话还是大冒险
You want to play "Truth or Dare"?

903
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:27,560
-真心话还是大冒险  -真心话
- Truth or Dare? - Ok. Wow, uh, truth.

904
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,460
既然我是你高中的梦中情人
If I was your high school crush,

905
01:02:30,460 --> 01:02:31,890
那你为什么从来没约过我
how come you never asked me out?

906
01:02:34,530 --> 01:02:39,240
-我一直没有机会  -机会
- You know... I never had my "In". - Your "In"?

907
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:42,100
就是最佳时机
Yeah... you know, the right moment.

908
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,510
就是天时地利人和
You know the perfect confluence of events.

909
01:02:53,160 --> 01:02:54,450
我总跟自己说
I've been telling myself

910
01:02:54,450 --> 01:02:58,250
上高中的时候
that since high school. and it's bullshit.

911
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:00,650
我曾经很多次都想约你出去
I had plenty of opportunities to ask you out.

912
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:03,910
我就是害怕
I was afraid.

913
01:03:07,190 --> 01:03:08,960
真心话
Truth.

914
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,220
如果我高中时候约你  你会答应吗
If I had asked you out in high school, would you have said yes?

915
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,180
这不公平
That's not fair.

916
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,140
如果当年知道你是现在这样的话
If I had known then what I know now...

917
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,770
多莉  直说吧
Tori... come on.

918
01:03:28,310 --> 01:03:31,670
不会  我可能会拒绝你
No. I probably wouldn't have said yes.

919
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,170
你怎么一副很解脱的样子
Why do you look so relieved?

920
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,620
因为我确实解脱了  我最大的遗憾就是
Because I am! My biggest regret is

921
01:03:41,620 --> 01:03:45,520
在高中没有勇气约你出去
not having the balls to ask you out in high school.

922
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:47,860
现在我知道了  结果都一样
And now I know it wouldn't have made a difference.

923
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:49,870
如果我约你了  你拒绝了
Besides which, if I had and you rejected me,

924
01:03:49,880 --> 01:03:51,160
我可能会鄙视你
I would have despised you...

925
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:53,680
就不会像现在这样和你坐在一起
... and I wouldn't be sitting here with you right now, having...

926
01:03:55,860 --> 01:03:58,360
度过我一生中最美妙的夜晚
...having the best night of my entire life.

927
01:04:05,860 --> 01:04:07,360
大冒险
Dare!

928
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:10,900
嘴靠过来
Come over here and bring your

929
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:16,350
越近越好  但不许碰到
lips as close to mine as possible, without touching.

930
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:22,030
真心话  你没耍我吧
Truth. are you messing with me right now?

931
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:26,350
大冒险  你试试就知道了
Dare. come and find out!

932
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:40,350
来嘛
Come on...

933
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:44,850
-这样可以了吗  -不  再近点
- Is that good? - No. Not good. Come closer.

934
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,530
什么声音
What's that sound?

935
01:04:57,910 --> 01:05:03,460
我想是我的心  跳得太快了
I think that's my heart... beating like really fast.

936
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:08,460
你说我敢不敢让它跳得再快点
Dare me to make it go faster.

我们开始在水里扑腾
We start splashing around and fooling

1045
01:13:25,330 --> 01:13:27,930
嬉戏欢笑  然后这个游泳圈

Yeah. My crazy grandmother.

1049
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,810
她对我说
And she says to me

1050
01:13:38,810 --> 01:13:41,970
"我不知道你们是在做爱还是要淹死了"
"Ican't tell if you're fucking or drowning..."

1051
01:13:41,970 --> 01:13:44,480
"都已经吵得我睡不着觉了"
"...but neither one is letting me get any sleep."

1052
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:49,550

Why'd you steal a car? Why'd you steal it?

1073
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:44,270
这不关他的事
He had nothing to do with it,

1074
01:14:44,270 --> 01:14:46,640
全是我做的  我们一起进去的
it was all me. He was there, yeah...

1075
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:50,010
可是他关键时刻跑了  回车上去了
...but he chickened out at the end. He went back to the car.

1076
01:14:50,010 --> 01:14:51,290
你什么都没干?
You did nothing!?

1077
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,310
我开这车来着  仅此而已
I drove the stolen car, that's it.

1078
01:14:53,310 --> 01:14:57,660
这车是我偷的  那可卡因就在车上
I stole the car. And then the cocaine was in the car.

1079
01:14:58,910 --> 01:15:02,560
-可卡因不是你们买的  -不不  不是
- You didn't buy the coke? - No, no, no.

1080
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:06,360
-你一点都没吸?  -没  我对天发誓  爸爸
- And you didn't have any? - No I swear to god, dad.

1081
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:08,690
求你了  富兰克林先生
Please Mr. Franklin.

1082
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:11,120
别送我到监狱去
Don't send me to jail.

1083
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:14,430
这款车真不错
Yeah this car is in pretty rough shape.

1084
01:15:14,430 --> 01:15:16,410
这车多少钱  巴里
What's the sticker price on this, Barry?

1085
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,290
五万三
Fifty three thousand.

1086
01:15:19,010 --> 01:15:21,390
如果你要喷镀铬漆并配全皮座椅
Fifty eight thousand with the full chrome

1087
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,230
要五万八
and leather package.

1088
01:15:23,230 --> 01:15:25,290
等你们服刑期满
Yeah, after you serve your jail time,

1089
01:15:25,290 --> 01:15:28,490
还得需要至少一两年的时间才能
I figure you'll be on probation...

1090
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:32,680
还清这车钱
...working this off for at least one to two years.

1091
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:34,130
爸爸  这车损坏得没那么严重
Dad, the car's not that damaged.

1092
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:36,790
-见鬼  -需要三年喽
- Holy shit! - Maybe three!

1093
01:15:36,790 --> 01:15:39,950
-四年  -你疯了吧  爸爸
- Four years. - Jesus Christ, dad.

1094
01:15:41,350 --> 01:15:42,610
五年
Maybe five.

1095
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:45,040
这得看你能找到什么工作
Depending on what kind of job you get.

1096
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:46,790
当然了  以你的学历
Of course with your education,

1097
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:49,260
找份体面的工作还是没问题的
you should be able to earn a decent salary.

1098
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:50,780
我发誓我明天就去面试工程师
I swear to God I'll get an engineering job, dad!

1099
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:53,460
但你不想做工程师  马修
But you don't want an engineering job, Matthew.

1100
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:54,960
你让我做什么我就做什么
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

1101
01:15:54,960 --> 01:15:56,630
但你自己想做什么
But what do you want?

1102
01:15:58,210 --> 01:15:59,270
我不知道
I don't know.

1103
01:15:59,270 --> 01:16:03,780
爸爸我很抱歉  我错了
No, Dad I'm sorry. I'm just messed up, ok?

1104
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:05,430
我不知道自己想做什么
I don't know what I wanna

1105
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:07,450
我很抱歉我活得这么失败
do and I'm sorry I'm such a fucking failure!

1106
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,360
你还没真正失败呢  孩子
You haven't really failed, son.

1107
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:16,190
因为你都从来没有为成功努力过
Because you haven't really tried to succeed.

1108
01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:18,870
所以别自诩为失败者
So don't credit yourself as a failure.

1109
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:21,190
你不配
You're worse than that!

1110
01:16:26,940 --> 01:16:28,720
我只是暂时想不通 爸爸
I just can't figure it out, dad.

1111
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:33,060
进了监狱可别这么哭了
Don't cry like that in jail, son.

1112
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:39,020
我不想去那
I don't wanna go.

1113
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:44,610
法庭传唤你们之前  你们要在
You boys will spend at least, at least

1114
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:48,120
洛杉矶监狱拘留10天
7 days in LA county jail before they arraign you.

1115
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:52,890
-那里还有娈童犯  -求你们别说了
- You'll be there with child molesters. - Please don't.

1116
01:16:52,890 --> 01:16:53,820
别担心
But don't worry.

1117
01:16:53,820 --> 01:16:56,620
我们肯定会告诉狱警们你们的家长是警察
We'll make sure the guards know you're a cops kid.

1118
01:17:01,110 --> 01:17:04,110
比尔  我演不下去了  瞧瞧麦特的脸
Hey Bill, I can't keep this up. Look at Matt's face.

1119
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:13,630
小伙子们  这次饶过你们  下不为例
Ok boys. This is your one and only Mulligan.

1120
01:17:13,630 --> 01:17:14,590
什么
What?

1121
01:17:14,590 --> 01:17:17,950
-你们可以走了  -天哪  谢谢你
- You're free to go. - Oh my god, thank you.

1122
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,500
你们不逮捕我们怎么交差
You guys don't have to turn us in?

1123
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:26,440
放松  麦特  我们可是洛杉矶警局的
Relax, Matt. We're LAPD.

1124
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:30,130
记住下不为例  巴里 不许再吸毒
But don't do it again, Barry! I mean it. No more coke!

1125
01:17:30,130 --> 01:17:33,920
怎么可能  我保证绝对没有下次了
Oh are you kidding me! I promise, never, never.

1126
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:37,120
你疯了吗  今晚真是太疯狂了
Are you crazy! This was like the craziest night.

1127
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:38,840
把你脸上的可卡因擦掉
Wipe that coke off your face.

1128
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:46,760
我动不了  帮帮我  约翰逊先生
I can't...someone... Mr. Johnson!?

1129
01:17:53,810 --> 01:17:55,210
谢谢你  富兰克林先生
Thank you, Mr. Franklin.

1130
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:59,860
麦特  不要坐以待毙啊
Matt, take a shot at something.

1131
01:17:59,860 --> 01:18:03,580
别想太多  有机会就抓住
Don't think about it too much. Just take the shot.

1132
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,600
我都不知道路在何方
I don't even know where to aim.

1133
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:10,370
机会到处都有  要把握住啊
Anywhere...everywhere...just take wild shots.

1134
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:13,830
你只要努力就行
Hell, it's something just to hear the gun go off.

1135
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:19,030
谢谢你  爸爸
Thanks, dad.

1136
01:18:28,310 --> 01:18:29,840
吓死我了
That was very scary!

1137
01:18:31,770 --> 01:18:33,710
我魂都丢了
My brain feels like snot.

1138
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:37,740
她可能把车停在凯尔家了
I think she might have left the car back at Kyles.

1139
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,250
麦特  别去了
Matt come on.

1140
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:52,510
滚球  滚球
Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball!

1141
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:54,960
有谁认为布罗德真的会
Anybody who thinks Broder will

1142
01:18:54,960 --> 01:18:56,880
挑战这个球  把你们的赌注给布莱斯
actually ride the ball, place your bets with Bryce...

1143
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:57,770
不相信他的
...anybody who thinks he won't

1144
01:18:57,770 --> 01:18:59,720
认为他是个孬种的...
go through with it, cause he's a total pussy...

1145
01:18:59,720 --> 01:19:00,940
把赌注给本基
...place your bets with Benji.

1146
01:19:00,940 --> 01:19:04,410
你们自己决定
And it's going to be...choice!

1147
01:19:23,880 --> 01:19:25,000
他们来真的了
They're gonna run the world.

1148
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,320
你怎么知道她还在这里
How do you know she's still here?

1149
01:19:27,860 --> 01:19:29,800
混蛋
Asshole.

1150
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,190
她果然在这
She's here.

1151
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:44,620
能给我个头盔吗
Do I get a helmet?

1152
01:19:44,620 --> 01:19:46,700
没问题  就在下面
Yeah, it's down there, right... right by the tampons.

1153
01:19:46,730 --> 01:19:47,930
关上盖子
Fucking slam it!

1154
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,200
我擦
Hey, fuck.

1155
01:19:58,500 --> 01:20:03,470
麦特...别生气
Matt... please, don't be mad.

1156
01:20:03,470 --> 01:20:06,980
雪莉 哥真的伤不起
Wow, Shelly. this really hurts.

1157
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:16,300
我不玩了  不玩了
No I'm not riding it man. I'm not riding it.

1158
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:18,300
我今天被炒鱿鱼了
I got fired today.

1159
01:20:26,610 --> 01:20:28,480
我想到那个球里面去
I think I'm gonna ride the ball.

1160
01:20:28,730 --> 01:20:31,130
-多莉  -我不想再听你扯淡了
- Tori! - I'm not interested in anymore of your bullshit..

1161
01:20:31,230 --> 01:20:34,850
听我说  只有一件事我对你撒谎了
Look, listen to me. I only lied about one detail about myself.

1162
01:20:34,850 --> 01:20:37,020
那就是我的工作  其它的全是真实的
And that's my job. Everything else was real...

1163
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:38,750
今晚是...真实的
tonight was... real...

1164
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,750
而且非常美好
And it was amazing.

1165
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:42,400
但承认吧  你绝对不会
But you never would have

1166
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,980
和我交谈超过两分钟
talked to me for more than 2 minutes, admit it...

1167
01:20:43,980 --> 01:20:46,030
如果你知道我在阳光海岸音像店上班
...if you knew I worked for Suncoast Video.

1168
01:20:46,620 --> 01:20:49,900
你整晚都在骗我就是为了能和我上床
You lied to me all night so I would have sex with you.

1169
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:51,210
那你和我上床不就是因为
So you only had sex with me

1170
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,500
我是银行家吗
because you thought I was a banker?

1171
01:20:53,500 --> 01:20:54,960
错  我和你去派对
No, I went to a party

1172
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:56,950
是因为你是银行家
with you because I thought you were a banker.

1173
01:20:56,950 --> 01:20:59,590
我和你上床是因为
But I had sex with you because I

1174
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:06,030
你风趣幽默而且诚实
thought that you were smart and funny and honest.

1175
01:21:06,830 --> 01:21:09,340
我以为你和别人不一样
I thought you were different from everybody else.

1176
01:21:09,830 --> 01:21:10,950
但我错了
But you're not.

1177
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:15,030
你和其他那些懦弱的小男孩没任何区别
You're just like all these other scared little boys.

1178
01:21:15,490 --> 01:21:17,760
好吧  谁想来
All right, hey. who's it gonna be?

1179
01:21:18,300 --> 01:21:20,200
今晚谁会征服这里
Who's steppin up to the plate tonight.

1180
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,770
谁想一举成名
Who wants a shot at the title?

1181
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:25,110
我来
I'll do it!

1182
01:21:25,110 --> 01:21:27,280
女士们先生们  有一位勇士
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a contestant.

1183
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,240
他就是麦特・富兰克林
The Mattinator. Franklin!

1184
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:33,400
你要做什么
What are you doing?

1185
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,090
我不知道
I don't know.

1186
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:38,910
大家让开  都让开
Clear the way. Clear the way.

1187
01:21:40,010 --> 01:21:42,140
不行 麦特  你别上去
No, Matt. Please don't do this, ok!

1188
01:21:42,140 --> 01:21:43,770
你不需要向这群人证明什么
You don't have to prove anything to these people.

1189
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:46,120
认为麦特不行了
Whoever thinks Matt's not gonna do it,

1190
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:47,590
把赌注给本基
place your bets with Benji.

1191
01:21:47,590 --> 01:21:49,270
-有谁...  -别去
- And anybody... - Don't.

1192
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:52,290
兄弟  听我的  别去
Listen to me. You don't wanna do this, man.

1193
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:53,490
让我来
Let me do it for you.

1194
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:55,470
你还要去实现你的理想呢
You have a great life ahead of you.

1195
01:21:55,470 --> 01:21:57,780
而我什么也没有  麦特  别去
I got nothing. Matt, don't do this!

1196
01:21:57,780 --> 01:21:59,050
真他妈的见鬼
God damn it!

1197

女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

1198

1200

1201
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:13,960
你干嘛要这么做
Why are you doing this?

1202
01:22:15,060 --> 01:22:18,060
求你了别这样  麦特  天哪
Please don't do this, Matt. Oh my god.

1203

I'm Matt Franklin.

1204
01:22:23,380 --> 01:22:26,560
我在商场里的阳光海岸音像店上班
I work at Suncoast Video at the mall...

1205
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:29,080
我还和父母住在一起
...and I still live with my parents!

1206
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:33,160
你这个废物
You suck!

1207
01:22:34,060 --> 01:22:36,600
我不知道自己在做什么
I don't know what I'm doing up here.

1208
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,780
我很害怕  你们知道吗
I'm scared. And you know what...

1209
01:22:39,340 --> 01:22:41,880
一直以来因为我对生活的恐惧
I have been so afraid of my life,

1210
01:22:41,880 --> 01:22:43,810
让我错失很多良机
that I have missed my life.

1211
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:47,760
但你们和我一样  我们都是胆小鬼
But I'm like all of you. we're all scared!

1212
01:22:48,150 --> 01:22:49,810
承认吧
I mean c'mon. Admit it.

1213
01:22:51,170 --> 01:22:53,310
我们都在做自己不想做的事
We're all trying to be something that we're not.

1214
01:22:54,390 --> 01:22:56,840
但今晚  一切都将改变
But tonight, all of that changes.

1215
01:22:57,340 --> 01:22:59,480
今晚  我不再胆怯
Tonight, I'm not afraid.

1216
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:03,300
今晚  我要对那堆臭狗屎说一句话
Tonight, I got one thing to say to all that bullshit!

1217
01:23:06,610 --> 01:23:07,940
去你他妈的
Fuck it.

1218
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:24,200
凯尔  我求你
Kyle... Kyle... I'm begging you.

1219
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,470
别玩了好不好
Please don't let him do this.

1220
01:23:25,470 --> 01:23:27,860
亲爱的  这个很安全的
No, honey. It's actually really safe.

1221
01:23:27,860 --> 01:23:30,210
放松点  球会将沿着这山坡滚下去
Relax. He's gonna roll down this hill right,

1222
01:23:30,210 --> 01:23:32,860
你看到那坡了吗 那是上坡
you see the bend... it actually goes up hill, right.

1223
01:23:32,860 --> 01:23:34,150
你知道重力的作用吧
You know how gravity works, right?

1224
01:23:34,150 --> 01:23:36,180
球会在那边停下  不会有事的
He's just gonna stop. It's gonna be gentle.

1225
01:23:36,180 --> 01:23:37,770
是他决定的
And, it's gonna be choice!

1226
01:23:37,770 --> 01:23:39,860
听着  听我说
Look! Look! I'm telling you,

1227
01:23:39,860 --> 01:23:41,200
他是我哥哥  我爱他
that's my brother and I love him...

1228
01:23:41,200 --> 01:23:42,300
我不想你这么做
...and I don't want you to do this!

1229
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:43,970
我没强迫他  是他自愿的
Oh... did I say it was going to be choice?

1230
01:23:43,970 --> 01:23:46,140
冷静
I did, so cool out!

1231
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:54,620
为麦特・富兰克林欢呼吧
Yeah, let's make some noise for Matt Franklin!

1232
01:24:04,730 --> 01:24:05,930
我数到三
On three!

1233
01:24:07,690 --> 01:24:08,560
三

1234
01:24:19,670 --> 01:24:20,920
见鬼
Oh shit! Oh Shit!

1235
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:23,050

救命
Oh my god

1240
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,010

1241
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:50,300
救命
Oh my god

1242
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,560
救命

1243
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,820
救命
Oh my god

1244
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:02,070
不要啊
Oh shit

1245
01:25:08,130 --> 01:25:09,490
活见鬼了
Fuck

1246
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:10,930
不要啊
Oh my god

1247
01:25:10,930 --> 01:25:14,500
我擦
Fuck me! Fuck me!

1248
01:25:39,070 --> 01:25:41,090
见鬼  救命
Shit. Help!

1249
01:25:41,090 --> 01:25:42,070
我擦
Fuck!

1250
01:25:58,940 --> 01:26:00,870
-下车  我来开  -宝贝
- Give me your truck! - Honey,

1251
01:26:00,870 --> 01:26:02,100
我们设计好的路线不是这样的
the road is not supposed to do that.

1252
01:26:02,100 --> 01:26:04,030
-把你他妈的钥匙给我  -冷静点
- Give me your fucking keys! - Relax.

1253
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:05,270
-快给我  -冷静点  好吗
- Now  - Relax, ok

1254
01:26:05,270 --> 01:26:06,170
别他妈的碰我
Don't fucking touch me.

1255
01:26:06,170 --> 01:26:07,740
我没想到那个球会这么失控
I did not know the road was gonna bend like that.

1256
01:26:08,240 --> 01:26:09,080
我来开车
I'll drive.

1257
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,050
麦特
Matt!

1258
01:26:50,810 --> 01:26:51,870
麦特
Matt!

1259
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,560
不不
No, no no.

1260
01:27:00,740 --> 01:27:02,240
你还好吗
Are you ok? You ok?

1261
01:27:02,740 --> 01:27:04,020
他大爷的
Holy Shit!

1262
01:27:04,740 --> 01:27:09,240
-你酷毙了  -我坐了那该死的球
- You were awesome - I rode the fucking ball!

1263
01:27:18,510 --> 01:27:20,490
谢天谢地
Thank god.

1264
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,620
麦特
Matt!

1265
01:27:22,620 --> 01:27:24,020
带走他吧
Take him.

1266
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:30,050
麦特  不准再那么干了  听到没
Matt, don't ever do that again, you hear me!?

1267
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:32,050
听你的
That's not a problem.

1268
01:27:43,890 --> 01:27:45,420
能给我你的电话号码吗
Can I have your phone number?

1269
01:27:47,500 --> 01:27:51,350
我只是想带你去吃晚饭  或者看场电影
I just want to take you out to dinner, or like a movie.

1270
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:54,430
和你约会
Just hang out with you.

1271
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:57,400
麦特你在高中时是个窝囊废
Matt you were a loser in high school.

1272
01:27:57,400 --> 01:28:02,860
现在你是个玩过球睡过我的窝囊废
Now you're just a loser who rode the ball and fucked me!

1273
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:08,170
这下你高兴了?
Are you happy?

1274
01:28:08,830 --> 01:28:10,480
不
No.

1275
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:13,650
我骗了你我很抱歉
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

1276
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,610
我真的很抱歉  多莉
I'm so sorry, Tori.

1277
01:28:17,190 --> 01:28:19,020
我不会再缠着你了
I'll leave you alone now.

1278
01:28:21,130 --> 01:28:22,470
我发誓
I promise.

1279
01:28:26,520 --> 01:28:27,890
麦特
Matt!

1280
01:28:30,070 --> 01:28:33,120
818 404-7327
818 404-7327

1281
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:41,060
今晚其实很爽
And that was pretty impressive.

1282
01:28:51,710 --> 01:28:55,090
麦特
Matt. Hey Matt!

1283
01:28:56,510 --> 01:28:59,110
我朋友麦特・富兰克林
My friend Matt Franklin!

1284
01:29:04,470 --> 01:29:05,970
就这么结束了吗
So it all worked out!

1285
01:29:06,470 --> 01:29:08,570
你昨晚读那封信时很高兴
You were happy when you read that letter tonight.

1286
01:29:08,570 --> 01:29:09,870
-我才没高兴  -你就是高兴
- No, I was not happy. - Yes.

1287
01:29:09,970 --> 01:29:11,170
-我不是  -你就是
- I was not. - Yes you were.

1288
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:11,900
我没高兴
I was not happy.

1289
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,270
我亲眼看见的  我只想你能承认
I saw it. I just want you to admit it!

1290
01:29:14,470 --> 01:29:16,530
什么  承认什么
What? admit what?

1291
01:29:16,530 --> 01:29:18,470
承认我不想让我的小宝贝离巢吗
That I don't want my baby to leave the nest?

1292
01:29:18,470 --> 01:29:19,970
你就为这个生我的气吗
Is that why you're mad at me?

1293
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:23,820
凯尔  我不打算搬家了
I'm canceling the movers, Kyle.

1294
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,270
那是什么意思
Whoa, what does that mean?

1295
01:29:25,470 --> 01:29:27,970
你明白的
You know what it means.

1296
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:30,370
宝贝  今晚你答应我的求婚了
Honey, you said yes tonight.

1297
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:34,420
-是啊我  知道  -噢  温蒂
- Yeah I know. - Oh shit, Wenders.

1298
01:29:35,190 --> 01:29:36,840
别这么对我
Don't do this to me.

1299
01:29:37,480 --> 01:29:41,460
我求求你不要这样
I'm begging you don't, don't do it. Please don't.

1300
01:29:43,410 --> 01:29:45,460
我已经决定了
I'm doing it.

1301
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:02,960
你伤透了我的心
You just screwed with my heart.

1302
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:12,910
你知道吗
You know what? I don't know

1303
01:30:12,910 --> 01:30:15,180
我不知道我现在该做什么
what the hell I'm gonna do with myself now.

1304
01:30:17,150 --> 01:30:18,660
见鬼  在我思考该做什么的这会儿
Hell, I don't know what to do with

1305
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:21,060
我想不出我该做什么
myself while I'm thinking about what to do with myself.

1306
01:30:24,440 --> 01:30:26,240
你知道的  这就是上大学的意义所在
You know, that's what college is for.

1307
01:30:28,770 --> 01:30:32,260
-会有很多这个  -不不  别是现在
- There's a lot of this. - No, not right now.

1308
01:30:33,460 --> 01:30:35,460
还有很多这个...
And there's also a lot of this...

1309
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,960
你说的有点道理
You're beginning to make a lot of sense.

1310
01:30:59,340 --> 01:31:01,300
我们该说再见了吧
We should... probably say goodbye,

1311
01:31:01,300 --> 01:31:03,230
免得我又搞砸了
before I screw this up again.

1312
01:31:03,460 --> 01:31:06,140
-好的  -好的
- Ok. - Ok.

1313
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:20,460
昨晚你真勇敢
That was bold!

1314
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:22,650
那是我一晚上做的最恐怖的事情了
That's the scariest thing I did all night!

1315
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,610
阳光海岸音像店  麦特

1316
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:27,160
-有人想吃早餐吗  -我  -还有我
- Who wants breakfast? - Yeah - Yeah...yikes!
