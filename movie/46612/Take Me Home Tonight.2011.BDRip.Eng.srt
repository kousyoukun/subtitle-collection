1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
Tori Frederking is back.

2
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:04,700
Her parents sent her to Europe for
the summer as a graduation gift...

3
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,700
...but she's back. Now I have 3 confirmed
sitings of her in this mall.

4
00:01:09,201 --> 00:01:15,200
Matt, I don't care about Tori Frederking.
I care about her, aged to perfection.

5
00:01:15,402 --> 00:01:17,601
- Daddy likie.
- Barry, you gotta focus here, man.

6
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:20,100
I'm talking about "The Frederking".

7
00:01:20,202 --> 00:01:21,702
You have to focus, okay.

8
00:01:22,203 --> 00:01:25,203
That was in the 10th grade. You got Truth
or Dared into a closet with the girl.

9
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:27,202
That was literally, seven
minutes in heaven.

10
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:30,803
When we got out of that closet, she told
everyone at the party that I was...

11
00:01:30,929 --> 00:01:32,129
- an amazing kisser.
- An amazing kisser.

12
00:01:32,204 --> 00:01:34,803
- She did!
- But, you didn't kiss her.

13
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,954
You spent seven minutes shitting your pants
and not making a move.

14
00:01:38,055 --> 00:01:39,455
I know, that's what makers her so
fucking awesome.

15
00:01:39,955 --> 00:01:42,355
When I got out of the closet, everyone
started ragging on me for choking.

16
00:01:42,456 --> 00:01:44,955
She lied and said I was an amazing kisser.

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:47,054
- Pretty stellar move, huh.
- To the max.

18
00:01:47,056 --> 00:01:49,955
Oh my god. I've been hearing this story
since we shared our mothers uterus.

19
00:01:50,956 --> 00:01:54,456
Oh, and by the way, did you have the balls
to ask her out after that?

20
00:01:54,657 --> 00:01:57,057
- I can't remember...
- No, but only because I never had my "in".

21
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:58,757
- Don't do this!
- Don't do this!

22
00:01:59,457 --> 00:02:00,657
- Hey!
- Hey!

23
00:02:00,957 --> 00:02:01,457
- Come on.
- Come on..

24
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:03,457
- How do you always know what I'm gonna say?
- How do you always know what I'm gonna say?

25
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:04,458
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

26
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:05,957
You guys are really freaking me out
with the twins shit.

27
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:08,758
Watch and learn brother. I'm going in.

28
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:10,958
Eye of the tiger, buddy.

29
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,458
I tiger.

30
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,459
- Don't like how this looks.
- No, no good.

31
00:02:21,459 --> 00:02:24,559
So uh, so you like uh, music?

32
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,460
I hate it!

33
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:30,460
Swing and a miss.

34
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:32,961
Oh, not the book Barry.

35
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:34,961
No, no. Not the art of war. Oh God.

36
00:02:35,462 --> 00:02:37,762
You ever read Sun Tzu's "Art of War"?

37
00:02:38,462 --> 00:02:41,462
I have. It's amazing.

38
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,463
Give you my number.

39
00:02:44,462 --> 00:02:47,462
I'll loan it to you. Get back to me, at a
later date, of your choosing.

40
00:02:48,463 --> 00:02:52,462
And we'll have, I don't know, a bottle of
chilled white Zin.

41
00:03:07,465 --> 00:03:10,465
I'm free on uh, Saturday.

42
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,466
Call me.

43
00:03:12,466 --> 00:03:13,966
Shermer High Class of 84.

44
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:15,966
THE FUTURE IS YOURS!

45
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,467
Take Me Home Tonight

46
00:04:13,403 --> 00:04:14,903
Ronald Reagan: "Win one for the Gipper".

47
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:36,476
- Hey Tori.
- Hey guys.

48
00:04:46,477 --> 00:04:47,977
Whew. This humpback whale just swims
right by me, right.

49
00:04:48,477 --> 00:04:49,977
I've never felt so scared in my life.

50
00:04:50,678 --> 00:04:52,278
That's when it hit me.

51
00:04:52,478 --> 00:04:55,477
This is what I want to do with my life.
This is what I want others to do.

52
00:04:55,778 --> 00:04:59,978
See. That's why the second I got back to LA...
boom... opened Mint Travel.

53
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,478
Wait, you own it?

54
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,479
Yeah dude.

55
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:06,579
Went to the bank, got a loan. Pieces fell
right into place.

56
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,979
So what about you, I
thought you went to uh...

57
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:11,079
- MIT!
- MIT!

58
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,480
I just graduated. But uh, I hated it.

59
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:17,480
Yeah it was all like, theory and machines...
I was on this one way highway...

60
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,180
I was like...

61
00:05:19,481 --> 00:05:20,981
You know... rest stop, please.

62
00:05:22,482 --> 00:05:23,982
So this is a rest stop?

63
00:05:24,481 --> 00:05:26,481
Oh yeah. This is totally temporary.

64
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:30,982
You know what you should do? You
should travel.

65
00:05:31,483 --> 00:05:32,982
See the world. Find your hump-back whale.

66
00:05:33,482 --> 00:05:34,982
You come see me, ok?

67
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:36,983
Seriously, it's the slow season right now.

68
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:40,582
Everbody's at work or school. Perfect time
for Matt to shine.

69
00:05:42,484 --> 00:05:45,684
You take care man.

70
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:50,491
- Excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

71
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,242
Hey, don't I know you?

72
00:06:58,243 --> 00:06:59,443
Well I don't think so.

73
00:06:59,743 --> 00:07:02,243
No, I do. I know you from somewhere.

74
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:06,243
- Oh, you went to Sherman, didn't you.
- I did!

75
00:07:06,244 --> 00:07:07,744
- That must be it.
- Yeah, me too!

76
00:07:08,244 --> 00:07:10,244
- Oh weird.
- I actually think you were in my homeroom.

77
00:07:10,744 --> 00:07:12,144
What?

78
00:07:12,244 --> 00:07:13,744
Yeah, you were the really smart kid.

79
00:07:15,245 --> 00:07:17,245
You won the attendance award... every year.

80
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:19,245
Yeah.

81
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:22,245
- It's me, Tori.
- Matt Franklin.

82
00:07:22,646 --> 00:07:25,246
I knew I knew you from somewhere... cool!

83
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:29,746
So... er... ah... what are you up too?

84
00:07:30,247 --> 00:07:31,247
Well, uh...

85
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:34,746
I went to Duke and I
graduated, with honors.

86
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:37,747
Yeah. And then I got awarded this
internship at Drexel Burnham.

87
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:40,248
So, I moved back.

88
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:42,447
Oh, it's an investment bank.

89
00:07:42,748 --> 00:07:44,748
- I know what it is.
- Oh, I didn't mean to...

90
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:48,248
- No no, it's fine. I'm in the same business, so.
- Really?

91
00:07:49,248 --> 00:07:51,048
Yeah. Where do you work?

92
00:07:51,249 --> 00:07:52,749
I'm at Goldman Sachs.

93
00:07:53,249 --> 00:07:57,248
Oh that's funny. I didn't know they had
an office in Los Angeles.

94
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,250
I know, that's weird.

95
00:08:02,251 --> 00:08:03,751
A lot of people don't.

96
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,750
I'm in Japanese takeovers.

97
00:08:08,251 --> 00:08:11,251
So, are you going to Kyle Masterson's
party tonight?

98
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,250
Uh, I don't know...

99
00:08:14,252 --> 00:08:16,752
Oh. You should totally go. It was pretty
good last year.

100
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:19,552
Word is, someones gonna ride the "ball"
tonight.

101
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:24,253
Where are they?

102
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,753
Weird.

103
00:08:26,254 --> 00:08:28,253
Hellooo!

104
00:08:29,253 --> 00:08:31,253
You know what. Just take it. Yup just
take it.

105
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:34,753
There we go. I'll pay for it when this
jackass gets back.

106
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:37,154
Great! Thank you.

107
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:41,654
So maybe I'll see you tonight... Terry?

108
00:08:41,755 --> 00:08:44,754
- Tori.
- Right... Tori... sorry.

109
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:58,755
<i>- Barry Nathan.
- Dude, you will not believe who was just in here, Tori Frederking.</i>

110
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,757
Bottom line it for me.

111
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:03,255
I think she was flirting with me. I
honestly got that vibe.

112
00:09:03,257 --> 00:09:06,057
That's highly unlikely. Can you do
better for me boss?

113
00:09:06,258 --> 00:09:09,758
She said I should totally go to
Kyle Masterson's party tonight.

114
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:11,758
This is it. I finally have my "in".

115
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:14,058
<i>- Ah, I see.
- We're going to that party!</i>

116
00:09:14,084 --> 00:09:15,558
I'm finally getting her phone number.

117
00:09:16,259 --> 00:09:19,959
- Yeah. That's all you got for me?
- Oh yeah, what do you know about investment banking?

118
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,159
Nothing.

119
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:22,959
- Currencies?
- Nothing?

120
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,760
That's not acceptable!

121
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,459
You've got to bend a bit more here boss.
This guy just had another baby.

122
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:32,010
<i>Oh, you're trying to close a sale.
Vagina, vagina, vagina...</i>

123
00:09:35,012 --> 00:09:36,912
Good luck. We'll pick you up at 5:00.

124
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:41,011
Fine. No I will! I'll take it out of my
own god damn salary!

125
00:09:42,013 --> 00:09:47,012
No, thank you! It's a pleasure.
Such a fucking pleasure.

126
00:09:48,013 --> 00:09:50,513
I'm sorry that you had to witness that.

127
00:09:51,014 --> 00:09:58,513
Steven. That bastards not gonna budge.
But um, off the top of my head, this is what I'm gonna do.

128
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:02,514
I'm gonna knock 3 grand off.

129
00:10:03,515 --> 00:10:06,015
Your boss is standing right behind you.

130
00:10:06,516 --> 00:10:12,015
And I'm not buying your bullshit... Barry!
Or a sedan.

131
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:27,517
Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.

132
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:43,518
You know what?! I gave up college for
you bastards.

133
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,020
Oh shit.

134
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,520
Start the engine.

135
00:10:54,521 --> 00:10:56,021
Fuck you!

136
00:10:58,522 --> 00:11:02,021
So um, dad. Somebody's gonna ride
the "ball" tonight.

137
00:11:02,522 --> 00:11:07,022
Darling, nobody rode that thing when I was
a kid. And nobody's gonna ride it tonight.

138
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:09,522
How's your dad doing, Barry?

139
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:14,523
Well, his parole got pushed back about six
months, so he's pretty upset about that.

140
00:11:15,523 --> 00:11:18,523
I still don't understand
why they let you go.

141
00:11:19,524 --> 00:11:24,023
7 years of my life, Libby. They stole
my youth.

142
00:11:24,524 --> 00:11:27,724
Look at it this way, Barry. At least
you went for it.

143
00:11:28,525 --> 00:11:32,024
You realized a goal. You rolled up your
sleeves and you applied yourself.

144
00:11:33,525 --> 00:11:36,025
Well I see the traditional evenings
torture is in full swing.

145
00:11:37,526 --> 00:11:39,825
Matthew, we had a deal.

146
00:11:40,526 --> 00:11:44,925
You said just give me the summer to figure things out.
Well guess what. The summers over!

147
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:46,525
I want to hear your plan.

148
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:52,527
Dad, I guess my plan is to keep working at Suncoast until
I figure out what I really want to do with my life.

149
00:11:53,028 --> 00:11:55,427
Why don't you just get an engineering job
until you figure it out?

150
00:11:55,528 --> 00:12:01,527
Honey, we just think you have such potential.
You could be anything. You could be an astronaut.

151
00:12:02,529 --> 00:12:06,029
Oh, problem solved. I'll just be an
astronaut.

152
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:12,029
Matthew, I didn't give a quarter of my savings
to MIT so you could work at the mall.

153
00:12:12,530 --> 00:12:16,529
I'll see you all in the morning. I gotta
go to work.

154
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:17,830
Matt!

155
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:23,031
- Are you OK?
- I applied to Cambridge for my masters.

156
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:26,931
- Holy shit! You finally did it.
- I don't wanna open it.

157
00:12:27,032 --> 00:12:30,332
- Why not?
- Because I'm scared, dip shit.

158
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:34,832
- Oh... want me to open it?
- No! Matt, no! Knock it off!

159
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,133
No I think you do.

160
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:41,732
- Wendy, you're going to England.
- I don't know. I don't even know if I'd go.

161
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,533
Why?

162
00:12:43,534 --> 00:12:49,533
I don't know if Kyle would come or not.
We took possession of the condo on Tuesday...

163
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:53,834
I mean look, he'll visit. He needs to
experience a new language. Open it!

164
00:12:55,236 --> 00:12:58,335
I just applied to see if I could get in.

165
00:12:58,536 --> 00:13:04,535
Okay, Wendy, you know that I hate
giving you compliments, right?

166
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:08,036
I've read your short stories. They're
amazing.

167
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,036
I know.

168
00:13:10,537 --> 00:13:14,737
Open it, open it, open it.

169
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:16,163
Fuckin open it!

170
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:17,737
- No!
- Ok!

171
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:19,538
No I'm not going to. No, not now.

172
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,038
No, I just want to have fun tonight.

173
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,639
Matt? Don't tell anyone, promise!

174
00:13:24,739 --> 00:13:29,538
You can trust me. I'm a Goldman
Sachs man.

175
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,639
Good luck with that...

176
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,039
Ok, here we go. Nelson Mandela,
Purple Rain, windsurfing.

177
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,341
- Windsurfing?
- Windsurfing?

178
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,541
What am I doing?

179
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,541
I'll never get this girl.

180
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:58,042
I don't wanna hear that talk tonight. Ok?
How long do I know you?

181
00:13:58,543 --> 00:14:00,543
- Since 5th grade.
- Since 5th grade, right?

182
00:14:01,543 --> 00:14:06,842
You're whippin it real good now. Look at
you. You're the smartest guy I know.

183
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:10,044
The acne is all cleared up.

184
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,844
Hey, you've had sex now.

185
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:17,170
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

186
00:14:17,545 --> 00:14:22,344
I'm gonna be with you, every step of
the way. You're gonna do this, Matt!

187
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:23,845
And you're gonna do it well.

188
00:14:24,546 --> 00:14:27,045
You're gonna get this broads number.

189
00:14:28,246 --> 00:14:31,746
Hey great work today guy, alright. Thank
you very much. Good job today.

190
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:34,472
Appreciate it. Bien. Mucho!

191
00:14:34,547 --> 00:14:36,047
- Hey Kyle.
- Hey.

192
00:14:36,547 --> 00:14:38,047
Get these lights on. Let's see what
this looks like.

193
00:14:38,148 --> 00:14:39,747
Hey watch. I'm gonna school this
bitch, man.

194
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:42,472
Guys. Get a beer. You're off the clock.
Hang out. Good job today.

195
00:14:43,848 --> 00:14:47,948
Stellar! That's exactly what I'm talking
about. We having a party here or what.

196
00:14:47,949 --> 00:14:49,049
Play that fuckin music, white boy.

197
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,550
Oh, if I didn't have a cast on, I'd
school you little bitches.

198
00:15:48,556 --> 00:15:54,055
- Oh shit! I can't show up in this car.
- Why not?

199
00:15:54,557 --> 00:15:56,757
Uh, the Frederking does not roll in a
kumquat.

200
00:16:00,557 --> 00:16:06,056
That's my? Bottle from MIT. Come on,
I was saving that for something special.

201
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:11,307
It's kinda special that I've never drunk
this much, this fast before.

202
00:16:11,309 --> 00:16:13,308
Hey, listen. You will get through this.

203
00:16:15,309 --> 00:16:18,309
I got fired today, ok? Fired.

204
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:25,309
I didn't go to screw all day and drink all
night college, like you twin bastards did.

205
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:28,709
Tonight I'm catching up.

206
00:16:30,311 --> 00:16:32,811
- Take a right at these lights up here.
- Why?

207
00:16:33,311 --> 00:16:38,310
Take a right! I'm sorry.

208
00:16:46,813 --> 00:16:48,813
I'm having no part of this.

209
00:16:49,313 --> 00:16:53,112
Yeah Barry, I'm a little fuzzy on how we're
gonna get away with this.

210
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:59,312
I have a set of keys. I know all the alarm
codes. It's almost perfectly legitimate.

211
00:17:01,314 --> 00:17:02,814
Almost.

212
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,914
- You just honk the horn if anything shows up.
- Roger that.

213
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:25,417
Listen Barry. We really don't want to spend
tonight in the LA county jail...

214
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:28,216
Giving some white supremacist a crying
blow job.

215
00:17:28,318 --> 00:17:32,317
That's not gonna happen, Matt. There's
no way you'd cry.

216
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:33,818
Look!

217
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:40,318
Mike the prick bastard sales manager keeps the
keys to the 560SL in his prick bastard desk.

218
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:43,344
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

219
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,219
I don't know?

220
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,220
We're gonna bring it back later, nobody's
gonna know the difference, okay.

221
00:17:49,245 --> 00:17:52,345
I don't know. What if someone sees us?
I think there might be security cameras.

222
00:17:52,521 --> 00:17:56,120
Matt, stop thinking. Ok, we'll just
do it.

223
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:59,546
- Shut off the alarm.
- No problem.

224
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,823
Fuck!

225
00:18:14,324 --> 00:18:16,824
They changed the alarm codes, man. Those
bastards didn't trust me.

226
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,723
I wonder why.

227
00:18:27,325 --> 00:18:29,825
Oh my god. Holy fuck! This is great!

228
00:18:42,277 --> 00:18:46,277
- You pussy! Get back in the game!
- C'mon.

229
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:06,079
What the hell is he doing?

230
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,081
Test drive?

231
00:19:32,582 --> 00:19:37,582
- Holy shit!
- Stole a car! We stole a car!

232
00:19:39,583 --> 00:19:41,583
Unbelievable.

233
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,083
I've never driven the 560SL before, Matt.

234
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,085
They never let me.

235
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:58,585
- Man... maybe you should take it back.
- No.

236
00:19:59,586 --> 00:20:03,585
You need this car tonight, Matt. You
need this car tonight.

237
00:20:08,587 --> 00:20:09,787
<i>Doreen! What's up?</i>

238
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:10,587
<i>Tell 'em Where You from.</i>

239
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,787
<i>Straight Outta Compton
Another crazy-ass Nigga.</i>

240
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:17,587
<i>Punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets Bigger
I'm a bad mutha fucka and you know this.</i>

241
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:22,586
<i>But the pussy ass niggas won't show this.
But I don't give a fuck, I'm a make my snaps.</i>

242
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:27,588
<i>If not from the records in the jack and the craps
Like burglary, the definition is jackin.</i>

243
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:32,089
<i>But when I'm legally armed, it's called packin.
Crazy mutha fucka from the street.</i>

244
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,591
Oh my god...

245
00:20:45,591 --> 00:20:48,491
Think your prick bastard boss keeps a
comb in here?

246
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:54,092
Holy...

247
00:20:55,593 --> 00:20:57,092
Are you stupid?

248
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:07,093
- What is that finger thing?
- I don't know.

249
00:21:09,594 --> 00:21:13,093
- Tastes like aspirin.
- My tongue is numb.

250
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:17,595
Holy shit, Barry. That was awesome.

251
00:21:22,596 --> 00:21:24,096
My god!

252
00:21:29,096 --> 00:21:32,096
- Sunshine!
- Hammer pants!

253
00:21:35,597 --> 00:21:39,597
- Hey, how's it going?
- Did you two manage to fuck each other yet?

254
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,898
- What?
- What?

255
00:21:42,598 --> 00:21:48,198
Oh shit, Matt. Matt Franklin. And uh, your
buddy your always hanging out with.

256
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,099
What's up. You never makes these
things, man.

257
00:21:50,199 --> 00:21:51,599
So that's the "ball".

258
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:53,799
In person, live, via satellite.

259
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,400
- You know it's not via anything, right?
- Yeah, I get the point.

260
00:21:57,599 --> 00:22:01,099
- I don't think he knows what "via" means.
- Yeah fuck you.

261
00:22:01,851 --> 00:22:06,350
Wendy get up here. C'mon baby. Get your
hot ass up here and give me a kiss.

262
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:08,351
Be careful.

263
00:22:10,852 --> 00:22:12,352
Oh, sorry.

264
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:15,652
Ok Matt. Share with everybody.

265
00:22:16,152 --> 00:22:18,352
- Nothing.
- Go ahead. What? What were you saying?

266
00:22:18,853 --> 00:22:20,052
This looks suicidal, man.

267
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:22,777
C'mon. You just don't like it cause the
ball represents "balls" ...

268
00:22:22,853 --> 00:22:23,853
...which you don't have.

269
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:25,353
Kyle.

270
00:22:25,854 --> 00:22:28,754
- Oh, is this one of those "metaphors"?
- Matt!

271
00:22:28,853 --> 00:22:33,853
Wendy, no. I got this one.
Yeah, yeah, it's a metaphor.

272
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:38,954
- So the "ball" is...
- Balls!

273
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:42,355
Good one.

274
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:47,355
- This is...
- That is a metaphor. I totally got him.

275
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:22,358
Oh my God. Exclamation point! Matt
Franklin.

276
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:25,360
Do not go anywhere.

277
00:23:34,862 --> 00:23:36,362
Nice shades, asshole!

278
00:23:38,862 --> 00:23:42,162
- No sign of the Frederking.
- Yup.

279
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:46,862
Man I feel like I'm in 10th grade again.
I'm gonna put these on ice.

280
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:50,862
Hey Franklin.

281
00:23:50,864 --> 00:23:53,363
- Down here Hans Solo.
- Ah, fuck!

282
00:23:54,564 --> 00:23:57,364
- Carlos, what happened to you?
- 67 times 365?

283
00:23:57,865 --> 00:23:59,365
- You're in a wheelchair.
- Answer!

284
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:04,364
- Uh... 24455. What's up?
- I've been really lazy. Just kidding.

285
00:24:04,465 --> 00:24:06,765
I got hit by a drunk driver right
after graduation, but...

286
00:24:06,866 --> 00:24:10,365
"Don't cry for me Argentina" It's not so
bad, I get better parking, tons of pussy.

287
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:12,866
I mean I have stronger opinions about
hills now but, whatever.

288
00:24:13,867 --> 00:24:15,866
So what have you doing, building
jet packs?

289
00:24:16,866 --> 00:24:19,766
- Uh, no, I work at Goldman Sachs.
- No you don't! No way you work there!

290
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:22,367
No I do. I work in Asian takeovers.

291
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:26,467
That's funny, cause you know where I
work? Goldman fucking Sachs.

292
00:24:26,493 --> 00:24:28,793
- You don't work there!
- You work at Goldman Sachs?

293
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:32,167
You bet your legs I do. Think I'm gonna
let this shit hold me back?

294
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:37,368
You don't need to walk to speculate currencies.
I said "You don't need to walk to speculate currencies"!

295
00:24:38,569 --> 00:24:40,569
I'm doing what I want. I'm following
my dream.

296
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:42,869
- Eat it.
- I thought you wanted to play baseball!

297
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,369
- Fuck you, Franklin!
- Ah, look. Do you know Tori Frederking?

298
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,170
- Yeah, I know her.
- Well if you see her, could you show her this...

299
00:24:51,196 --> 00:24:52,770
...and tell her I work at Goldman
Sachs.

300
00:24:52,871 --> 00:24:54,870
Wow, that's pathetic dude.

301
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:56,871
Probably not gonna work either. We
don't have an LA office.

302
00:24:57,071 --> 00:25:00,371
Everybody knows that, who has
half a sack. Spelled with a "k".

303
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:03,371
- Well just don't rat me out.
- Yeah I'll think about it.

304
00:25:03,872 --> 00:25:06,372
If I'm not gettin laid. When I'm gettin
laid I don't think about much else.

305
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,972
Anyway, kinda gettin bummed out talking
to you. What do you do, anyway?

306
00:25:10,173 --> 00:25:13,373
- I thought you went to MIT.
- I work at Suncoast video.

307
00:25:13,774 --> 00:25:18,873
Wow... Congratulations? Mom and dad
must be psyched.

308
00:25:18,874 --> 00:25:22,374
I'm gonna get outta here. Check this
out, "moon walk".

309
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:25,374
Will you guys move. I'm trying to
fucking party here.

310
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:30,375
And it's Kyles crazy grandma, standing there.
And she says, listen to this...

311
00:25:30,876 --> 00:25:35,875
I can't tell if your fucking or drowning.
But neither one is letting me get any sleep.

312
00:25:38,377 --> 00:25:40,376
So embarrassing.

313
00:25:40,876 --> 00:25:43,876
So, uh, the next day, my dad pulls me
aside...

314
00:25:43,902 --> 00:25:46,802
...and he offers to help with the
down payment on a condo.

315
00:25:46,877 --> 00:25:51,877
Yeah, so I guess we screwed ourselves
into the market.

316
00:25:53,879 --> 00:25:55,878
"Literally".

317
00:26:00,879 --> 00:26:05,078
Yeah, anyway so we're moving in on Tuesday, and...
but it's great cause there's a hot tub...

318
00:26:22,882 --> 00:26:26,081
Hi. I can't handle this right now. I want
to do some of the coke.

319
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:27,607
What do you mean you can't handle this?

320
00:26:28,182 --> 00:26:30,482
- I want to do the coke!
- No, what can't you handle?

321
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:34,782
- Not doing the coke!
- Ok, Barry, we're not cocaine people.

322
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:39,482
A, My dad's a cop. B, I'm defining my
gray area...

323
00:26:39,508 --> 00:26:42,008
...which I'm pretty sure doesn't include
hard narcotics.

324
00:26:42,084 --> 00:26:43,884
- Give me the bag.
- No.

325
00:26:43,984 --> 00:26:45,884
Give me the bag or you don't get
the car keys.

326
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:52,584
Okay, just take it easy "Scarf ace."

327
00:26:52,885 --> 00:26:54,885
This one here is an alarm...

328
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:41,889
- Tori Frederking?
- Rick Herrington. Oh my god.

329
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:46,891
- How are you?
- I'm good... wow... oh.

330
00:27:50,892 --> 00:27:53,392
Hey, how are you?

331
00:27:53,893 --> 00:27:56,392
What's up man? Good to see you.

332
00:27:56,892 --> 00:28:00,892
Dude and I we're just packing up.
Moving in together next week.

333
00:28:01,894 --> 00:28:04,893
- We got a condo.
- Yeah, baby tell them the story.

334
00:28:04,993 --> 00:28:08,593
We're here 4th of July. My family always has
the big party here, and the house is packed...

335
00:28:08,819 --> 00:28:11,419
...with relatives and so there's no place
for us too...

336
00:28:11,894 --> 00:28:13,894
- I know.
- You know?

337
00:28:13,995 --> 00:28:16,495
So we come down to the pool, where
it's always kinda quiet, right.

338
00:28:17,896 --> 00:28:22,395
- You know, getting into it, water splashing...
- So embarrassing.

339
00:28:22,896 --> 00:28:27,395
A flotation ring hits me in the head. And
I'm like mid pump, its like... what?

340
00:28:27,496 --> 00:28:32,196
And I look and it's my crazy grandmother
and she says to me...

341
00:28:32,397 --> 00:28:37,396
...I can't tell if you're fucking or drowning,
but neither one is letting us get any sleep.

342
00:28:37,397 --> 00:28:41,397
Next day, dad pulls us aside and offers
to help with a down payment on the condo.

343
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:45,497
Yeah so I guess we screwed ourselves
into the market.

344
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,399
That's good.

345
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,200
Hey, um, Matt you remember Tori.

346
00:28:57,299 --> 00:28:58,799
Whoa, yes... weird.

347
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,400
- How's it going? Mark?
- Oh, heh heh...

348
00:29:03,901 --> 00:29:04,901
Very funny.

349
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,900
It's Matt.

350
00:29:09,902 --> 00:29:11,902
Is my name.

351
00:29:14,902 --> 00:29:19,402
So, high school again, huh?
Freaky Deeky.

352
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:22,902
How's that?

353
00:29:27,904 --> 00:29:34,403
Wow, this breeze is great. It's like,
wind surfing weather, you know.

354
00:29:35,405 --> 00:29:37,904
I tell you, I'd love to be out on
my board tonight.

355
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:41,905
- You're into wind surfing?
- Hell yeah!

356
00:29:41,906 --> 00:29:45,405
- Big time, you?
- No, I'm not!

357
00:29:46,906 --> 00:29:50,206
- Really?
- No!

358
00:29:50,907 --> 00:29:57,406
Yeah, no, well... cause wind?! Fuck that!

359
00:29:58,207 --> 00:30:03,207
Um, I should probably go check to make
sure we're not running out of soda, inside.

360
00:30:03,908 --> 00:30:07,407
- So I'll see you guys later.
- Good seeing you.

361
00:30:07,908 --> 00:30:09,408
See ya.

362
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:14,408
- You know it's funny...
- Hey, you ever find yourself in Paris?

363
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:17,609
- Uh, yeah...
- Yeah?

364
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:24,409
There's a lovely bistro right around
the corner from the Sorbonne, called the...

365
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:27,910
It's chevre chaud is impeccable.

366
00:30:30,911 --> 00:30:34,111
We are doing cocaine. Ok.

367
00:30:39,912 --> 00:30:42,212
Looks so easy in the movies.

368
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:47,912
Let's do this. You're gonna do this, ok.
You're gonna feel unbelievable.

369
00:30:49,914 --> 00:30:54,113
Nostrils ready. We're doing this. Ok.

370
00:31:14,917 --> 00:31:16,416
Nice!

371
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:21,417
Great.

372
00:31:21,918 --> 00:31:23,917
I get stuck with a bag of shit.

373
00:31:33,745 --> 00:31:35,745
Blammo!

374
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:11,422
Hey, you're hot!

375
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:17,723
I'm growling at you! Did you hear me. I
was growling at you like a lion.

376
00:32:17,749 --> 00:32:19,549
A lion in the jungle.

377
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,224
I'm Barry.

378
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,224
Confirmation, yeah you're hot!

379
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:29,625
- What?
- Hello.

380
00:32:31,925 --> 00:32:33,425
Show them the?

381
00:32:34,926 --> 00:32:38,426
You are tall. But I can still hear you.

382
00:32:39,926 --> 00:32:43,726
Whoa, you're gonna hurt somebody man.
You're gonna take someones eye out.

383
00:32:43,927 --> 00:32:47,426
- That guy is my boyfriend.
- Hope he screws better than he dances.

384
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:54,427
Oh shit he's about to do the splits. I
can see it in his eyes. There he goes.

385
00:32:54,928 --> 00:32:58,928
He's got no testes left.
He's got no testes left.

386
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:01,428
Who's got a watermelon?

387
00:33:02,929 --> 00:33:05,329
Yo, go find your own date.

388
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:09,830
I got my own date. I think that
you used to know her.

389
00:33:17,931 --> 00:33:22,431
What's up? Want to dance?
Let's see what you got, boy!

390
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:34,331
Take a good look around you. Everything
changes, but "nothing" changes.

391
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:35,933
Yeah, I hear you brother.

392
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:44,433
So I been getting into this whole wine thing lately.
Tasting it and talking about it.

393
00:33:44,934 --> 00:33:48,933
We should go down to my dads boat and uh,
do a little sampling.

394
00:33:49,334 --> 00:33:52,734
Oh hey... there you are.

395
00:33:53,435 --> 00:33:58,934
Matt, hello? When are you
gonna show me that thing?

396
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:02,735
Right, the uh, waterfall. On the other
side of the patio.

397
00:34:02,761 --> 00:34:06,861
- I was gonna show you that.
- I love waterfalls. I'll just be back in a bit.

398
00:34:12,937 --> 00:34:19,436
- How do you like that?
- That was awesome. So good. I got goose bumps.

399
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:23,438
So...

400
00:34:23,939 --> 00:34:26,438
This waterfall's... you know...

401
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:28,439
There's no waterfalls.

402
00:34:28,939 --> 00:34:30,439
I know.

403
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:36,639
- Have you seen Niagara?
- No I haven't. Have you?

404
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:40,441
No.

405
00:34:41,941 --> 00:34:44,441
Hey Tori, uh...

406
00:34:45,942 --> 00:34:48,941
- Have you...
- Hey! Everybody.

407
00:34:48,966 --> 00:34:52,566
Barry Nathan and Tyler Jones are
having a dance off.

408
00:34:56,942 --> 00:35:02,442
But I am, my ridiculously dressed friend.
I am in downtown tokyo, I am the samurai dance master...

409
00:35:02,944 --> 00:35:05,043
...and I'm gonna dance your dummy playing
ass into the ground.

410
00:35:05,068 --> 00:35:06,568
Yo, DJ... hit it!

411
00:35:23,946 --> 00:35:25,946
Wow, that's amazing.

412
00:35:36,947 --> 00:35:38,447
That's all you got?

413
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:30,953
You had enough? You had enough?

414
00:36:35,954 --> 00:36:37,454
Fuckin a, Barry.

415
00:36:37,955 --> 00:36:39,955
I got you bitch.

416
00:36:46,956 --> 00:36:48,956
- C'mon. Chill out, alright?
- Cool, cool, cool.

417
00:36:53,957 --> 00:36:59,257
- C'mon you guys. We are adults.
- Fine, fine, fine. It's over.

418
00:36:59,283 --> 00:37:01,583
Don't do it again, white boy. Here.

419
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,458
God damn it, Barry.

420
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:15,458
- Are you OK? Oh my god she's choking.
- Somebody help her.

421
00:37:16,959 --> 00:37:20,959
I got her. I got you. Breathe...
breathe...

422
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,459
Get off her.

423
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:26,960
- You're gonna pull through. C'mon! Breathe!
- What are you doing?

424
00:37:27,461 --> 00:37:31,960
- I'm giving you the Heimlich.
- I wasn't choking. She was.

425
00:37:43,963 --> 00:37:45,962
I'm such a jackass. I'm sorry.

426
00:37:46,963 --> 00:37:51,763
I suck at this. I'm... I'm... What
am I doing? I'm sorry!

427
00:37:51,964 --> 00:37:55,563
You're awesome. I'm trying so hard, and
I... it's...

428
00:37:55,964 --> 00:37:58,764
Here's the thing. You were my high
school crush, by the way.

429
00:37:58,965 --> 00:38:01,964
And I just physically assaulted you in
front of a bunch of people.

430
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:05,465
I just hit rock bottom. So... don't
mind me.

431
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:07,264
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

432
00:38:07,289 --> 00:38:09,789
I don't see how it could get any worse.
Nope! Got it!

433
00:38:09,815 --> 00:38:13,815
I could ask you to dance and, chuck
my drink in your face...

434
00:38:13,841 --> 00:38:17,341
And twirl you into the fucking wall.
I'll do it.

435
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:19,467
I'm sorry... I was...

436
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:23,593
Oh I love this song!

437
00:38:27,968 --> 00:38:29,468
I love this song.

438
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:35,268
- Do you wanna... do you wanna dance?
- Sure!

439
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:37,468
Are you insured?

440
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:41,593
I will dance with you if you promise,
no twirling.

441
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,570
Right, I promise. I'll go slow.

442
00:39:06,473 --> 00:39:10,472
- I was wondering, uh... if I could get your phone...
- What?

443
00:39:11,973 --> 00:39:17,472
I was wondering if I could...
I could, uh...

444
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:23,474
I could always tell in high school, um,
that you were gonna land on your feet.

445
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,575
Ladies and gentlemen, if I could get
your attention please.

446
00:39:33,976 --> 00:39:38,075
First of all I want to say thank you to
everybody for chillin with me...

447
00:39:38,101 --> 00:39:39,801
...on my very last labor day party.

448
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:46,376
You know nothings changed it
seems like since we graduated.

449
00:39:46,402 --> 00:39:48,902
Trevor, talking to you. What's up
with that fucking ear ring, dude?

450
00:39:50,978 --> 00:39:53,478
We are changing, and we're moving on.

451
00:39:53,979 --> 00:40:00,678
We're going our separate ways. And some of
us are going our separate ways... together.

452
00:40:00,704 --> 00:40:01,978
You all know Wendy.

453
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:05,379
- Wendy Franklin here. Honey get on up here.
- What are you doing?

454
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:06,979
What is he doing?

455
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,380
I think that she is... one hell of
a chick.

456
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:20,980
Because she turned a lump of coal like me
into a diamond.

457
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:24,982
From all the pressure she put me under. Oh!

458
00:40:26,982 --> 00:40:31,482
Oh, wait. There's something I got here.

459
00:40:32,982 --> 00:40:36,482
- Oh my god!
- Oh my god!

460
00:40:36,983 --> 00:40:40,982
Wendy, will you marry me?

461
00:40:46,985 --> 00:40:50,484
- No!
- Hell yeah!

462
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:55,985
Yes, yes I will.

463
00:41:21,989 --> 00:41:23,989
Oh man, come on!

464
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:56,493
- Hey.
- Hey!

465
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,692
Look, I know everyone's making fun of you.

466
00:41:58,718 --> 00:42:01,918
But I just want to say I really loved
what you did out there tonight.

467
00:42:01,994 --> 00:42:09,493
- Who's making fun of me?
- Your dance was cool. It was like anti-dancing.

468
00:42:11,994 --> 00:42:14,994
It was like a big screw you to all them
conformist assholes.

469
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,220
I'm glad you liked it.

470
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:20,295
You didn't give a shit about any of
their shit, you know.

471
00:42:20,995 --> 00:42:22,995
Did you want to get naked?

472
00:42:23,996 --> 00:42:29,995
Wow, that was fast. For me I get naked
all the time.

473
00:42:33,998 --> 00:42:35,997
Come find me later.

474
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:49,999
Hey, can I talk to you for a sec?

475
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:54,199
- I don't wanna say this, but I really feel...
- Then don't!

476
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,000
Don't marry him.

477
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,499
- Oh, christ.
- The two of you...

478
00:42:58,501 --> 00:43:02,000
It's like you don't fit. I don't think
he can make you happy.

479
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:05,201
Well I already am happy, so your wrong
so leave me alone.

480
00:43:05,226 --> 00:43:07,099
Then why don't you open that envelope
from Cambridge?

481
00:43:07,101 --> 00:43:10,601
- Because I hate rejection.
- Come on. You know you got in!

482
00:43:10,627 --> 00:43:13,127
And you now he doesn't want you to go.
He's already holding you back.

483
00:43:13,302 --> 00:43:15,701
Kyle would support any decision that I
wanted to make as long as I was happy.

484
00:43:15,727 --> 00:43:17,527
Ok then, why didn't you tell him
you applied?

485
00:43:17,903 --> 00:43:20,903
I mean he's gonna be your husband, right?
Aren't you supposed to be honest with him?

486
00:43:21,002 --> 00:43:24,902
Oh you're lecturing me about honesty,
Mister "Goldman Sachs"?

487
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:27,003
The only reason you're saying all this
stuff is because you're jealous.

488
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:29,903
- You're jealous that I have a life and you don't!
- You're not gonna have a life.

489
00:43:29,929 --> 00:43:31,929
You're just supporting Kyle's life.

490
00:43:32,004 --> 00:43:34,404
That's why you said yes, right? So it
would all be wrapped up in a little bow.

491
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,930
Wendy, marriage is a big life decision.

492
00:43:36,004 --> 00:43:39,204
Oh, big life decisions? At least I'm making
some asshole.

493
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:40,930
You're so scared, you can't
choose anything.

494
00:43:41,005 --> 00:43:44,804
Not a girl, not a job... anything.
And you're just gonna sit there in your little...

495
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,930
...smarty pants fantasy bubble,
dreaming about...

496
00:43:47,006 --> 00:43:49,706
Tori Frederking when you know that she's
unobtainable.

497
00:43:49,732 --> 00:43:50,932
That's not true.

498
00:43:51,007 --> 00:43:54,806
You can't get her and you know it. So
there's really no risk at all, is there?

499
00:43:54,832 --> 00:43:56,332
It's bullshit, Matt and you know it!

500
00:43:59,007 --> 00:44:03,507
I was wrong. You're gonna look great
in an apron.

501
00:44:26,011 --> 00:44:28,311
So you know how I've always been into
fashion.

502
00:44:28,312 --> 00:44:30,910
Well I am in a van to New York.

503
00:44:31,011 --> 00:44:34,511
- Doesn't that so blow your mind?
- Totally.

504
00:44:35,012 --> 00:44:38,511
Let's go to the Drexel party. Why are
we still hanging out with the Sachs?

505
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:42,712
Some of us weren't offered full time positions.
I have some serious networking to do.

506
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,612
This is so totally not me, ok. I totally
think we can work something out.

507
00:44:46,638 --> 00:44:48,338
Just for tonight.

508
00:44:50,014 --> 00:44:51,014
- Shelly!
- Yeah?

509
00:44:51,114 --> 00:44:52,813
I gotta go.

510
00:44:53,013 --> 00:44:55,513
I totally don't know what I'm talking
about.

511
00:45:13,016 --> 00:45:15,515
Is that your car?

512
00:45:17,517 --> 00:45:19,017
This is the so cherry.

513
00:45:20,017 --> 00:45:22,916
- You make enough money for a car like this?
- Well, yeah...

514
00:45:23,517 --> 00:45:32,516
- Nobody stopped me when I drove it off the lot.
- Matt! Matt! Matt!

515
00:45:34,019 --> 00:45:39,518
This is Barry... the dancer.

516
00:45:40,019 --> 00:45:44,519
So are you guys going to that party in
Beverly Hills?

517
00:45:45,020 --> 00:45:48,519
Uh, yeah, we're thinking about it. You?

518
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:54,519
- Well yeah!
- Where is that party again?

519
00:45:55,021 --> 00:45:58,521
Well you know what. I know the way so
I should just, ride with you.

520
00:45:58,523 --> 00:46:01,521
- What?
- Oh my god, you slut.

521
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:07,022
- Oh my god, you slut.
- Look, you gotta ride with her friends.

522
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:12,522
- Really? Ok.
- Are you smoking now?

523
00:46:13,023 --> 00:46:16,822
When it rains it pours. Am I right,
brother?

524
00:46:18,024 --> 00:46:24,523
Come on, punch it up. Punch. And squeeze real tight.
And then the finger comes up. Bam!

525
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:26,524
- And then you go like this.
- Hey, get off me.

526
00:46:30,026 --> 00:46:35,525
- Hey, I guess I'm riding with you guys.
- Uh, I don't know.

527
00:46:36,626 --> 00:46:39,026
I have cocaine on me.

528
00:46:40,026 --> 00:46:42,526
- Can I ride in the back with you Barry?
- Yeah.

529
00:46:45,027 --> 00:46:49,826
Well this will be fun. It will be all bankers
at this party, so we will know a ton of people.

530
00:46:49,853 --> 00:46:52,853
Oh, great.

531
00:47:25,032 --> 00:47:27,731
- It's a great night for this, huh?
- Yeah.

532
00:47:32,033 --> 00:47:35,532
So this party is at my boss, Pete Bering's
house.

533
00:47:36,033 --> 00:47:38,332
Unfortunately he's a bit of a perve.

534
00:47:38,558 --> 00:47:42,758
Swear to god the only reason I got offered
a full time position at Drexel...

535
00:47:42,784 --> 00:47:43,984
...is cause he wants to see my boobs.

536
00:47:44,034 --> 00:47:46,934
- Really?
- Uh huh.

537
00:47:47,035 --> 00:47:50,234
- What about your friends boobs?
- Well, he's already seen them.

538
00:47:50,235 --> 00:47:51,535
- Really? Wow!
- Uh, huh.

539
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:56,534
You see that's the problem. Boob power
recedes once revealed.

540
00:47:57,035 --> 00:48:01,034
He hasn't and won't see mine, so I retain
the boob power.

541
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,260
Eye contact, Matt.

542
00:48:06,137 --> 00:48:08,037
You know we always know when you guys
look.

543
00:48:08,037 --> 00:48:11,836
- Not always.
- No, we do, it's true!

544
00:48:11,862 --> 00:48:16,462
- Go ahead, give it a shot. I'll look away.
- Okay.

545
00:48:19,038 --> 00:48:21,538
- Now.
- Wow! That, whoa!

546
00:48:22,039 --> 00:48:24,539
- That was good.
- Pretty good?

547
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:28,539
- Now.
- Wow, that's crazy.

548
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:31,939
I don't know. I think maybe you're
just getting lucky.

549
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:35,539
- Oh really? Try it again, big shot.
- Okay.

550
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:39,239
- Now.
- Wow, that is a gift!

551
00:48:39,340 --> 00:48:43,640
That's unbelievable. Best of seven?

552
00:49:09,044 --> 00:49:11,044
Holy shit, did you see that car?

553
00:49:40,048 --> 00:49:42,048
How are you guys?

554
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:52,048
- It'll cause the stock to rally.
- But I'm worried about them sustaining these margins.

555
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:54,549
- The rumors about this Russian oil field.
- It's going to happen because it's got momentum.

556
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:58,549
But you can't put momentum on a balance sheet.
I mean, their numbers are embarrassing.

557
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:02,750
That's irrelevant. We'll float some junk and then
they can buy a company with a balance sheet...

558
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:04,550
...that's not absolute shit.

559
00:50:04,551 --> 00:50:08,350
Walter, your not drinking. I warned you
about that. Excuse me.

560
00:50:08,551 --> 00:50:10,051
- Hello Tori.
- Hey Mr. Bering.

561
00:50:10,252 --> 00:50:15,751
Hey, it's Pete. Please. I was really hoping
you'd come. Walk with me. Excuse me.

562
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:18,952
- I think Beth's here.
- Didn't notice.

563
00:50:19,053 --> 00:50:25,552
Listen Tori. I was hoping to get your opinion on
the actualities of that Baltic Sterling nonsense.

564
00:50:27,054 --> 00:50:33,053
Would you mind coming upstairs. Take a
look at that report. Decode it for me.

565
00:50:33,054 --> 00:50:37,153
It's Pete, right? Pete Bering. Matt
Franklin. Good to see you again.

566
00:50:39,455 --> 00:50:41,855
- I'm sorry, have we met?
- Have we met?

567
00:50:50,057 --> 00:50:54,556
- Matt's over at Goldman Sachs.
- Guilty, as charged.

568
00:50:55,057 --> 00:50:57,856
So, Matt. Who do you work under
over there?

569
00:50:57,882 --> 00:50:59,082
Oh, well... I'm not at liberty to say.

570
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:03,557
- Why not?
- We pride ourselves on being a discreet firm.

571
00:51:04,058 --> 00:51:06,558
Our policy is don't discuss business.

572
00:51:07,058 --> 00:51:09,258
Really. Matt doesn't seem like a
Goldman Sachs man to me, Tori.

573
00:51:09,283 --> 00:51:12,283
Most of those blowhards can't shut up
about work.

574
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:16,759
Seriously, Matt, tell me the department,
let me do the math.

575
00:51:16,784 --> 00:51:17,984
I know a lot of people over there.

576
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:24,559
- What department?
- Yeah Matt. What... do... you... do?

577
00:51:28,061 --> 00:51:29,560
Excuse me.

578
00:51:30,061 --> 00:51:33,561
Do you guys know Yen? I mean...

579
00:51:35,062 --> 00:51:43,060
Say a Yen gets uh transferred from Mr.
Nariyada's bank, in Tokyo...

580
00:51:43,087 --> 00:51:46,487
...on a Monday and it lands in Rome.

581
00:51:47,663 --> 00:51:54,062
So what's .467 * 32? 149.5 Lira, right?

582
00:51:54,064 --> 00:51:56,863
Wam, Mr. Roma takes that, flips it over to
Mr. Queen Elizabeth...

583
00:51:56,888 --> 00:52:02,888
...so what's 149.5 divided by 22.3?
Six pounds, British Sterling and 78 pence, right?

584
00:52:03,065 --> 00:52:06,664
Wam! He takes it, flips it over to Mr. USA
today before opening bell...

585
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:11,190
So what's 6.78 divided by 1.68? It's 3.99
big bad dream bags.

586
00:52:11,216 --> 00:52:13,716
And guess who Mr. Yankee Doodle Dandy wires
it to over the international date line...

587
00:52:13,742 --> 00:52:15,842
Mr. Nariyada. How much is that Yen worth
now?

588
00:52:16,067 --> 00:52:19,967
1.012! 1.2 percent more in one day.
1.2 percent times 365 days...

589
00:52:19,993 --> 00:52:24,093
...and I'll do the math. That's a lot
of fuckin blow fish.

590
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,819
So that's what I do, Pete.

591
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,945
Currencies, Franklin?

592
00:52:33,068 --> 00:52:35,868
- Yeah Carlos.
- You two in the same division?

593
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:38,868
Franklin? Matt?

594
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:47,469
I'm just fucking with you. Matt's a star man.
It's like having rain man on the floor.

595
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:49,495
Except you can touch him and shit.

596
00:52:50,071 --> 00:52:52,571
In fact, he just got promoted.

597
00:52:53,071 --> 00:52:56,570
That's right. I didn't want to say
anything. Guy above me got fired.

598
00:52:57,071 --> 00:53:00,071
Some girl asked him for a raise and he
asked for a hand job.

599
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:03,571
I guess he's the one
that got the raise, huh.

600
00:53:04,272 --> 00:53:06,372
Sounds like my kind of guy.

601
00:53:07,573 --> 00:53:11,872
- She took him for about 8 Mil.
- Oh.

602
00:53:12,073 --> 00:53:15,573
Supreme Court takes sexual harassment
very, very seriously these days.

603
00:53:16,074 --> 00:53:18,073
It's about time, huh?

604
00:53:19,074 --> 00:53:23,574
Yes, yes, it is about time.

605
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:28,074
Well. Great meeting you, Matt. I have
to go make the rounds.

606
00:53:29,075 --> 00:53:31,575
You guys have fun.

607
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,575
Holy shit, that was amazing.

608
00:54:03,079 --> 00:54:05,379
Stay cool. Sexy redhead.

609
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:14,579
- Trish Anderson.
- Barry Nathan.

610
00:54:16,081 --> 00:54:22,981
- Is it snowing?
- I think it's like 65 degrees outside.

611
00:54:23,082 --> 00:54:27,081
- No I mean are you holding?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

612
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:33,081
- You want to have fun little?
- Yes I do!

613
00:54:33,082 --> 00:54:38,082
- Come with me.
- Really? Oh my god.

614
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:45,084
Oh my god.

615
00:54:46,085 --> 00:54:47,585
Oops, I did yours.

616
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:55,085
- Jesus christ, man.
- Oh, it's my friend Frances. It's ok though. Isn't it?

617
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,086
Ok, come on in man.

618
00:55:01,086 --> 00:55:02,886
You want any, future man?

619
00:55:03,287 --> 00:55:06,186
Come a little closer, Barry Nathan.

620
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:16,588
Beverly Hills.

621
00:55:29,089 --> 00:55:35,988
Hey Frances, um... do me a favor. Just
take yours to go. Ok pal? Just go!

622
00:55:36,090 --> 00:55:38,090
- Get the hell outta here.
- He doesn't want any of that.

623
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:40,091
He doesn't?

624
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:45,090
- What the hell does Frances want?
- He wants to watch.

625
00:55:48,092 --> 00:55:51,391
- I don't...
- He won't bother us. Just let him watch.

626
00:55:53,092 --> 00:55:55,692
- Ok, um... who is this Frances person?
- It's non-negotiable!

627
00:56:07,094 --> 00:56:09,094
I'm going to try this.

628
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:15,595
What do you think this house cost him?

629
00:56:16,095 --> 00:56:20,094
- Drug habit. Kids in therapy.
-? The view.

630
00:56:22,096 --> 00:56:24,596
But you like it, right?

631
00:56:25,096 --> 00:56:30,895
Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Drexel's great.
It's a real opportunity for me.

632
00:56:31,097 --> 00:56:36,596
I'll get stock options, great benefits.
You know it's really a wonderful...

633
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:40,098
What?

634
00:56:41,098 --> 00:56:43,097
I hate it!

635
00:56:45,098 --> 00:56:47,598
I hate my job!

636
00:56:49,099 --> 00:56:55,298
Wow, I've never said that out loud
before. But I do, I hate it. I do!

637
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:57,900
I hate all of this.

638
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:58,600
- Really?
- Hate it!

639
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:00,600
- Gotcha.
- Crazy right?

640
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,600
I just keep thinking, do I really want
to do this?

641
00:57:04,101 --> 00:57:07,600
- Is this what I want to do with my life?
- Is it?

642
00:57:08,101 --> 00:57:13,101
I do not know, that's the thing.
I'm so confused and I really, really don't know.

643
00:57:14,102 --> 00:57:19,902
I'm sorry this must sound ridiculous to you.
You're obviously very smart at your job.

644
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,602
No, no, Tori. Whoa!

645
00:57:22,103 --> 00:57:25,503
Are you kidding me? I got this thing that
I know I'm good at.

646
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:26,729
And everyone in my life...

647
00:57:28,104 --> 00:57:31,603
...expects me to turn it into a career.

648
00:57:32,104 --> 00:57:33,604
I can't stand it.

649
00:57:34,105 --> 00:57:38,104
- I know. I feel the exact same way every day.
- And then there's no turning back!

650
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:42,005
- It's gonna be like uh, family and mortgage.
- I know!

651
00:57:42,006 --> 00:57:43,105
- There's no way to quit.
- Yes!

652
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,330
- It's a trap!
- It's a trap!

653
00:57:50,107 --> 00:57:52,606
God, that sounds so messed up.

654
00:57:56,107 --> 00:57:58,607
Have you ever played the penis game?

655
00:58:00,107 --> 00:58:03,607
I'm not prepared to reveal that
information, thank you.

656
00:58:04,108 --> 00:58:07,607
No, it's a real game. I say the word
"penis" like really quiet...

657
00:58:08,108 --> 00:58:12,108
And then you say it just a little bit louder.
Then I say it a little bit louder than that...

658
00:58:12,134 --> 00:58:13,334
And the first to stop saying it, loses.

659
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:15,609
<i>Are you ready? Is easy. Penis</i>

660
00:58:16,109 --> 00:58:17,609
I don't know...

661
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:22,609
Tori trust me. There is nothing more fun than
a job you don't give a shit about losing.

662
00:58:24,110 --> 00:58:25,610
Penis.

663
00:58:26,111 --> 00:58:28,611
- Penis.
- Penis.

664
00:58:28,636 --> 00:58:30,636
- Penis!
- Penis!

665
00:58:30,662 --> 00:58:32,162
- Penis!
- Penis!

666
00:58:32,512 --> 00:58:34,512
- PENIS!
- PENIS!

667
00:58:38,112 --> 00:58:40,112
Let's call it a tie.

668
00:58:43,113 --> 00:58:46,612
- Chris, christ, you're out of control, lady.
- Yeah, fuck you too!

669
00:58:47,113 --> 00:58:48,913
- What? Sorry.
- Don't apologize to me.

670
00:58:48,938 --> 00:58:50,112
What do you think I am, a child?

671
00:58:50,114 --> 00:58:53,113
- Fuck you then.
- Yeah, that's better.

672
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:57,814
I'm gonna swallow you whole... son.

673
00:58:58,115 --> 00:59:01,114
If you don't mind, that would be
fantastic.

674
00:59:02,115 --> 00:59:08,814
I mean, um... suck my dick... bitch?

675
00:59:09,115 --> 00:59:11,615
Yeah. That's it!

676
00:59:19,117 --> 00:59:21,117
I'm gonna hit it with you, Barry Nathan.

677
00:59:23,118 --> 00:59:24,617
Wait a minute!

678
00:59:32,118 --> 00:59:35,018
- Hey, what the hell is he doing?
- Oh he's getting a better angle.

679
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,619
- Ok, he can't come near me!
- How close?

680
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:40,119
- I don't want him touching me at all.
-?

681
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,120
- Let me outta here!
- What, you don't like this?

682
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:46,619
Shit no!

683
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,020
- You crazy bitch.
- Yeah c'mon. Shout at me Barry!

684
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:56,120
I'll kill you!

685
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:06,521
People... freaky shit! I didn't go to
college, ok!

686
01:00:06,547 --> 01:00:11,847
You people crossed the line here today!
This is entrapment! No thank you!

687
01:00:16,124 --> 01:00:18,623
God it's like, who lives in this
neighborhood, right?

688
01:00:19,124 --> 01:00:21,124
Actually, hang on a sec.

689
01:00:25,124 --> 01:00:27,324
How do you feel about a
little yard hopping?

690
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:31,125
- I don't know.
- C'mon, let's get out of here.

691
01:00:36,126 --> 01:00:38,126
- Oh my god!
- Shah.

692
01:00:40,126 --> 01:00:42,126
I don't think anyone's home.

693
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:44,627
Really?

694
01:00:45,127 --> 01:00:46,727
Welcome to your new house.

695
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:51,327
How are you like this? No one else I
work with is this much fun.

696
01:00:51,353 --> 01:00:53,353
I can't believe you're a banker.

697
01:00:55,128 --> 01:00:56,628
Me neither...

698
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:02,628
- Oh shit.
- What?

699
01:01:03,129 --> 01:01:04,629
Oh yeah.

700
01:01:05,129 --> 01:01:06,629
- No.
- Yeah.

701
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:10,629
- We're doing this.
- I am not getting on that thing.

702
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:14,030
That was really smooth.

703
01:01:14,131 --> 01:01:15,831
- Come on.
- No, I'm not.

704
01:01:16,131 --> 01:01:18,630
- I know you want to.
- I'll watch safely from down here.

705
01:01:20,431 --> 01:01:24,431
Tori tonight we're not thinking.
We're doing.

706
01:01:37,133 --> 01:01:42,632
This is just coming back to me. Do you
remember when we played Truth or Dare?

707
01:01:43,134 --> 01:01:47,134
I think you and I got dared into 7 minutes
in heaven.

708
01:01:48,634 --> 01:01:51,634
No doesn't ring a bell.

709
01:01:52,135 --> 01:01:59,134
- But maybe if we play it again...
- You want to play "Truth or Dare"?

710
01:02:00,136 --> 01:02:04,536
- Truth or Dare?
- Ok. Wow, uh, truth.

711
01:02:04,636 --> 01:02:09,636
If I was your high school crush, how
come you never asked me out?

712
01:02:12,137 --> 01:02:16,637
- You know... I never had my "in".
- Your "in"?

713
01:02:17,138 --> 01:02:21,837
Yeah... you know, the right moment. You
know the perfect confluence of events.

714
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:29,639
No.

715
01:02:30,140 --> 01:02:35,539
I've been telling myself that since high
school. And it's bullshit.

716
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:38,565
I had plenty of opportunities to ask
you out.

717
01:02:39,141 --> 01:02:42,640
I was afraid.

718
01:02:44,141 --> 01:02:45,641
Truth.

719
01:02:46,142 --> 01:02:51,641
If I had asked you out in high school,
would you have said yes?

720
01:02:54,143 --> 01:02:58,642
That's not fair. If I had known then what
I know now...

721
01:02:59,143 --> 01:03:02,643
Tori... come on.

722
01:03:05,143 --> 01:03:08,643
No. I probably wouldn't have said yes.

723
01:03:13,144 --> 01:03:15,644
Why do you look so relieved?

724
01:03:16,145 --> 01:03:22,644
Because I am! My biggest regret is not having
the balls to ask you out in high school.

725
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:25,146
And now I know it wouldn't have made
a difference.

726
01:03:25,146 --> 01:03:28,445
Besides which, if I had and you rejected
me, I would have despised you...

727
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,971
...and I wouldn't be sitting here with
you right now, having...

728
01:03:33,147 --> 01:03:35,646
...having the best night of my entire life.

729
01:03:43,148 --> 01:03:44,648
Dare!

730
01:03:45,148 --> 01:03:53,647
Come over here and bring your lips as close
to mine as possible, without touching.

731
01:03:56,150 --> 01:03:58,649
Truth. Are you messing with me right now?

732
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:03,650
Dare. Come and find out!

733
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:17,652
Come on...

734
01:04:19,153 --> 01:04:22,152
- Is that good?
- No. Not good. Come closer.

735
01:04:31,154 --> 01:04:33,654
What's that sound?

736
01:04:34,155 --> 01:04:41,654
I think that's my heart... beating
like really fast.

737
01:04:43,156 --> 01:04:45,655
Dare me to make it go faster.

738
01:04:48,156 --> 01:04:50,656
I double dare you.

739
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:19,659
Oh, yeah hey look, no you know
what. No pressure, ok?

740
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,160
Tonight no thinking, just doing.

741
01:05:43,163 --> 01:05:45,162
- Now.
- Now.

742
01:05:55,164 --> 01:06:00,064
- What's going on, Wendy?
- Please just sit for a second, I just wanna talk.

743
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:06,864
Well, this is a big step. But I think
it's the right thing.

744
01:06:07,166 --> 01:06:08,366
Hell yes!

745
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:13,065
It doesn't exactly take a rocket surgeon
to figure that out.

746
01:06:14,167 --> 01:06:16,366
Kyle, I have to tell you something.

747
01:06:16,366 --> 01:06:21,666
- Please tell me you missed your period.
- No, no.

748
01:06:22,168 --> 01:06:25,867
- I applied to grad school.
- Oh.

749
01:06:26,168 --> 01:06:31,367
Wow, grad school. Wow... where?

750
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:34,668
- Cambridge.
- Is that in the valley?

751
01:06:35,169 --> 01:06:37,169
England...

752
01:06:39,169 --> 01:06:40,669
You want to go to England?

753
01:06:41,169 --> 01:06:46,668
Well, I don't know, I just thought we
could talk about it.

754
01:06:47,170 --> 01:06:51,870
- What about the condo?
- Well, we could always rent it out.

755
01:06:52,171 --> 01:06:55,970
We've got six franchises opening in
Encino alone next year.

756
01:06:56,371 --> 01:06:59,671
Honey my dad is gonna be fucking pissed.

757
01:07:00,172 --> 01:07:02,171
Oh, god damn it. I thought this was
gonna be a special night.

758
01:07:02,172 --> 01:07:03,672
- It is!
- Guess I was wrong.

759
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:06,671
- No it is.
- No your kinda questioning the whole thing.

760
01:07:06,697 --> 01:07:08,997
What you just want to call the whole
thing off, is that it?

761
01:07:09,022 --> 01:07:11,022
- I don't even know if I got in yet, Kyle.
- Oh!

762
01:07:12,173 --> 01:07:15,673
I've been too scared to open it, so why
don't you do it for me!

763
01:07:17,099 --> 01:07:20,799
Sure. Oh really?

764
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:29,674
<i>"Dear Ms. Franklin, thank your for your
interest in Cambridge University.</i>

765
01:07:30,176 --> 01:07:33,675
<i>We regret to inf..."</i>

766
01:07:38,177 --> 01:07:44,676
<i>"We regret to inform you that you have not
been accepted into our graduate program"</i>

767
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:47,177
God damn it!

768
01:07:51,178 --> 01:07:56,677
Hey, wait, c'mon. Let's not let some fancy
pants school in England ruin our night.

769
01:07:57,178 --> 01:08:03,777
Honey, you can still do your writing thing and
now you get to do it right here, next to me, ok.

770
01:08:05,179 --> 01:08:07,179
What can I do to make you feel better?

771
01:08:09,180 --> 01:08:13,479
How about some bathroom sex. Will that
do it?

772
01:08:17,181 --> 01:08:19,680
How many times have you done that?

773
01:08:21,181 --> 01:08:23,181
You know... 3...

774
01:08:24,182 --> 01:08:27,382
...and a half... times.

775
01:08:29,182 --> 01:08:31,182
Oh god.

776
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:34,508
See that is what I really like about
you, Matt.

777
01:08:35,183 --> 01:08:36,683
You're honest.

778
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,684
Tori, there's something that I gotta
tell you.

779
01:08:47,185 --> 01:08:49,184
You have a girlfriend right?

780
01:08:49,184 --> 01:08:53,184
No, it's um...

781
01:08:55,186 --> 01:08:56,685
It's kinda the opposite...

782
01:08:57,185 --> 01:08:59,185
- You have a boyfriend?
- No.

783
01:09:01,186 --> 01:09:04,685
Remember when I bumped into you this
morning at the video store?

784
01:09:07,187 --> 01:09:11,686
Actually I don't work at Goldman Sachs.
I work at that video store.

785
01:09:14,188 --> 01:09:17,688
- What?
- Seriously, I work at Suncoast Video.

786
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:19,688
Shut up...

787
01:09:22,189 --> 01:09:25,689
No, seriously, I work at Suncoast Video.

788
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:36,489
- You lied to me?
- No, I mean I know it was stupid.

789
01:09:36,690 --> 01:09:40,690
But I only did it because I thought if you
knew that my life was such a dead end...

790
01:09:40,691 --> 01:09:42,790
- I wouldn't sleep with you.
- No.

791
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:45,691
Oh my god. I am so stupid.

792
01:09:46,192 --> 01:09:50,191
I actually thought that maybe you wanted to
get to know me.

793
01:09:50,217 --> 01:09:51,191
I do!

794
01:09:51,192 --> 01:09:55,792
You know what. Congratulations Matt, you
slept with your high school crush.

795
01:09:55,818 --> 01:09:57,018
Mission accomplished!

796
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,692
No, Tori.

797
01:10:00,193 --> 01:10:02,993
Tori!

798
01:10:04,519 --> 01:10:07,219
Ah... Fuck!

799
01:10:11,695 --> 01:10:13,794
Where the hell have you been man?

800
01:10:14,695 --> 01:10:18,095
- You will not believe what the hell just happened.
- Barry, I gotta get out of here.

801
01:10:18,196 --> 01:10:20,495
Big ditto on that. These people are?

802
01:10:21,195 --> 01:10:23,195
Come on.

803
01:10:26,197 --> 01:10:28,196
Shit.

804
01:10:33,197 --> 01:10:35,696
Barry, Barry.

805
01:10:36,197 --> 01:10:38,697
- Yeah.
- I slept with Tori Frederking.

806
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,698
Are you shitting me?

807
01:10:55,200 --> 01:11:03,199
Los Angeles, Matt Franklin had sex
with Tori Frederking, tonight.

808
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,701
What a night!

809
01:11:14,727 --> 01:11:17,627
Then I told her I worked at Suncoast.

810
01:11:18,203 --> 01:11:20,202
And then you told her what?

811
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:23,002
I told her I work at Suncoast.

812
01:11:23,003 --> 01:11:27,003
- Why are you like this?
- It wasn't fair. I had to be honest with her.

813
01:11:27,004 --> 01:11:29,004
What are you, stupid?

814
01:11:29,203 --> 01:11:36,702
How do you fuck this up, man? Why can't you
give yourself one night of enjoyment?

815
01:11:38,205 --> 01:11:40,205
Put a little relish on your hotdog.

816
01:11:43,206 --> 01:11:44,705
Here...

817
01:11:45,205 --> 01:11:49,204
- I want you to do this.
- No.

818
01:11:49,206 --> 01:11:51,206
- Matthew...
- I don't do drugs.

819
01:11:51,207 --> 01:11:53,806
- You don't do anything.
- I just had sex with Tori Frederking.

820
01:11:53,907 --> 01:11:58,107
Yeah, well, I guess that's not gonna work
out for you now, is it?

821
01:11:58,208 --> 01:11:59,707
You fucked it up!

822
01:12:00,207 --> 01:12:01,707
Sorry pal.

823
01:12:04,208 --> 01:12:07,707
- Alright, take the wheel.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talkin about.

824
01:12:12,209 --> 01:12:15,108
- You got it?
- Barry!

825
01:12:15,209 --> 01:12:17,709
- Yeah.
- Holy shit!

826
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,710
Holy shit!

827
01:12:32,211 --> 01:12:34,511
We only lost a little bit.

828
01:12:59,215 --> 01:13:05,614
We start splashing around and fooling around and
the next thing you know, this flotation ring...

829
01:13:05,641 --> 01:13:06,841
...hits me in the head.

830
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:11,715
- And I look up and...
- It's his grandma.

831
01:13:12,216 --> 01:13:14,716
Yeah. My crazy grandmother.

832
01:13:15,217 --> 01:13:20,516
And she says to me "I can't tell if you're
fucking or drowning..."

833
01:13:20,542 --> 01:13:22,642
...but neither one is letting me get
any sleep.

834
01:13:25,218 --> 01:13:28,718
- Could be worse.
- No it couldn't, Barry.

835
01:13:29,219 --> 01:13:31,718
It couldn't be any worse.

836
01:13:33,219 --> 01:13:35,719
Put your hands in the air.

837
01:13:36,219 --> 01:13:41,718
I was wrong. Now it couldn't be
any worse.

838
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:45,220
- Matthew?
- Wow, wrong again.

839
01:13:46,221 --> 01:13:47,720
Oh my god, oh my god.

840
01:13:47,720 --> 01:13:48,720
Calling for a backup request, over.

841
01:13:50,221 --> 01:13:52,021
Are you two okay?

842
01:13:52,221 --> 01:13:53,721
- Yeah.
- Yeah dad.

843
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:58,721
- What's that all over your face, Barry?
- Cocaine.

844
01:14:00,222 --> 01:14:02,721
Dad, we're fine. Thank god you're
on duty tonight.

845
01:14:03,222 --> 01:14:04,722
Yeah.

846
01:14:05,223 --> 01:14:07,223
Let's get outta the car.

847
01:14:09,224 --> 01:14:11,223
Take it easy. Alright.

848
01:14:11,223 --> 01:14:12,223
- Get down on the ground!
- What?

849
01:14:12,723 --> 01:14:14,723
- Get down on the god damn ground!
- Oh my god.

850
01:14:16,724 --> 01:14:17,723
Oh no!

851
01:14:18,224 --> 01:14:20,724
Why'd you steal a car? Why'd you
steal it?

852
01:14:20,724 --> 01:14:25,423
He had nothing to do with it, it was
all me. He was there, yeah...

853
01:14:25,450 --> 01:14:27,150
...but he chickened out at the end. He
went back to the car.

854
01:14:27,225 --> 01:14:30,225
- You did nothing!?
- I drove the stolen car, that's it.

855
01:14:30,726 --> 01:14:34,725
I stole the car. And then the cocaine
was in the car.

856
01:14:35,726 --> 01:14:39,226
- You didn't buy the coke?
- No, no, no.

857
01:14:39,227 --> 01:14:43,225
- And you didn't have any?
- No I swear to god, dad.

858
01:14:43,227 --> 01:14:48,226
Please Mr. Franklin. Don't send me to jail.

859
01:14:50,228 --> 01:14:53,228
Yeah this car is in pretty rough shape.
What's the sticker price on this, Barry?

860
01:14:53,229 --> 01:14:55,728
Fifty three thousand.

861
01:14:56,228 --> 01:15:00,128
Fifty eight thousand with the full chrome
and leather package.

862
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:05,828
Yeah, after you serve your jail time, I
figure you'll be on probation...

863
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:09,855
...working this off for at least one
to two years.

864
01:15:10,231 --> 01:15:11,730
Dad, the car's not that damaged.

865
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:13,730
- Holy shit!
- Maybe three!

866
01:15:14,231 --> 01:15:17,231
- Four years.
- Jesus christ, dad.

867
01:15:18,231 --> 01:15:20,231
Maybe five.

868
01:15:20,231 --> 01:15:22,330
Depending on what kind of job you get.

869
01:15:22,356 --> 01:15:26,156
Of course with your education, you should
be able to earn a decent salary.

870
01:15:26,232 --> 01:15:31,232
- I swear to God I'll get an engineering job, dad!
- But you don't want an engineering job, Matthew.

871
01:15:31,233 --> 01:15:35,034
- I'll do whatever you want me to do.
- But what do you want?

872
01:15:35,233 --> 01:15:36,733
I don't know.

873
01:15:37,234 --> 01:15:41,034
No, Dad I'm sorry. I'm just messed
up, ok?

874
01:15:41,234 --> 01:15:44,934
I don't know what I wanna do and I'm
sorry I'm such a fucking failure!

875
01:15:48,235 --> 01:15:53,134
You haven't really failed, son. Because
you haven't really tried to succeed.

876
01:15:53,236 --> 01:15:56,136
So don't credit yourself as a failure.

877
01:15:56,235 --> 01:15:58,235
You're worse than that!

878
01:16:04,338 --> 01:16:07,338
I just can't figure it out, dad.

879
01:16:07,564 --> 01:16:10,564
Don't cry like that in jail, son.

880
01:16:13,090 --> 01:16:16,390
I don't wanna go.

881
01:16:19,238 --> 01:16:25,638
You boys will spend at least 7 days in
LA county jail before they arraign you.

882
01:16:26,539 --> 01:16:30,139
- You'll be there with child molesters.
- Please don't.

883
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,940
But don't worry. We'll make sure the
guards know you're a cops kid.

884
01:16:38,241 --> 01:16:41,840
Hey Bill, I can't keep this up. Look at
Matt's face.

885
01:16:41,866 --> 01:16:44,866
He's about?

886
01:16:46,242 --> 01:16:51,741
- Ok boys. This is your one and only Mulligan.
- What?

887
01:16:52,242 --> 01:16:55,742
- You're free to go.
- Oh my god, thank you.

888
01:16:57,244 --> 01:17:03,943
- You guys don't have to turn us in?
- Relax, Matt. We're LAPD.

889
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:07,243
But don't do it again, Barry! I mean
it. No more coke!

890
01:17:07,244 --> 01:17:12,244
Oh are you kidding me! Never, never. Are
you crazy!

891
01:17:12,744 --> 01:17:16,744
- This was like the craziest night.
- Wipe that coke off your face.

892
01:17:18,246 --> 01:17:24,245
I can't... someone... Mr. Johnson!?

893
01:17:31,247 --> 01:17:33,747
Thank you Mr. Franklin.

894
01:17:34,248 --> 01:17:37,247
Matt, take a shot at something.

895
01:17:37,248 --> 01:17:40,748
Don't think about it too much. Just
take the shot.

896
01:17:41,249 --> 01:17:42,749
I don't even know where to aim.

897
01:17:43,248 --> 01:17:47,748
Anywhere... everywhere... just take
wild shots.

898
01:17:48,249 --> 01:17:51,349
Hell, it's something just to hear the
gun go off.

899
01:17:55,150 --> 01:17:57,150
Thanks, dad.

900
01:18:05,452 --> 01:18:07,951
That was very scary!

901
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:11,752
My brain feels like snot.

902
01:18:12,252 --> 01:18:15,751
I think she might have left the car
back at Kyles.

903
01:18:19,253 --> 01:18:21,253
Matt come on.

904
01:18:26,254 --> 01:18:28,254
Ball! Ball! Ball! Ball!

905
01:18:29,504 --> 01:18:34,503
Anybody who thinks Broder will actually ride
the ball, place your bets with Bryce...

906
01:18:34,529 --> 01:18:37,529
...anybody who thinks he won't go through
with it, cause he's a total pussy...

907
01:18:37,555 --> 01:18:38,755
...place your bets with Benji.

908
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:42,005
And it's going to be... choice!

909
01:19:01,508 --> 01:19:05,008
- They're gonna run the world.
- How do you know she's still here?

910
01:19:05,509 --> 01:19:07,508
Asshole.

911
01:19:08,508 --> 01:19:10,508
She's here.

912
01:19:21,511 --> 01:19:24,710
- Do I get a helmet?
- Yeah, it's down there, by the tampons.

913
01:19:24,735 --> 01:19:25,935
Fucking slam it!

914
01:19:27,211 --> 01:19:30,211
??

915
01:19:30,511 --> 01:19:32,511
- Hey.
- Hey.

916
01:19:36,512 --> 01:19:40,911
Matt... please, don't be mad.

917
01:19:41,012 --> 01:19:44,312
Wow, Shelly. This really hurts.

918
01:19:50,514 --> 01:19:54,313
No I'm not riding it man. I'm not
riding it.

919
01:19:54,514 --> 01:19:56,314
I got fired today.

920
01:20:03,515 --> 01:20:06,015
I think I'm gonna ride the ball.

921
01:20:06,516 --> 01:20:08,916
- Tori!
- I'm not interested in anymore of your bullshit..

922
01:20:09,017 --> 01:20:13,115
Look, listen to me. I only lied about one
detail about myself.

923
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,242
And that's my job. Everything else was
real... tonight was... real...

924
01:20:16,516 --> 01:20:18,416
And it was amazing.

925
01:20:18,517 --> 01:20:21,516
But you never would have talked to me for
more than 2 minutes, admit it...

926
01:20:21,542 --> 01:20:23,742
...if you knew I worked for Suncoast Video.

927
01:20:24,517 --> 01:20:27,017
You lied to me all night so I would
have sex with you.

928
01:20:27,518 --> 01:20:31,018
So you only had sex with me because
you thought I was a banker?

929
01:20:31,518 --> 01:20:34,018
No, I went to a party with you
because I thought you were a banker.

930
01:20:34,519 --> 01:20:43,018
But I had sex with you because I thought
that you were smart and funny and honest.

931
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,519
I thought you were different from everybody
else. But you're not.

932
01:20:48,545 --> 01:20:52,745
You're just like all these other scared
little boys.

933
01:20:53,522 --> 01:20:58,121
All right, hey. Who's it gonna be? Who's
steppin up to the plate tonight.

934
01:20:58,147 --> 01:21:00,147
Who wants a shot at the title?

935
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,022
I'll do it!

936
01:21:03,522 --> 01:21:08,022
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a
contestant. The Mattinator. Franklin!

937
01:21:09,524 --> 01:21:11,023
What are you doing?

938
01:21:11,523 --> 01:21:13,023
I don't know.

939
01:21:15,324 --> 01:21:17,624
Clear the way. Clear the way.

940
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:21,224
No, Matt. Please don't do this, ok!
You don't have to prove anything to these people.

941
01:21:21,525 --> 01:21:25,024
Whoever thinks Matt's not gonna do it,
place your bets with Benji.

942
01:21:25,525 --> 01:21:27,025
- And anybody...
- Don't.

943
01:21:27,525 --> 01:21:31,325
Listen to me. You don't wanna do this, man.
Let me do it for you.

944
01:21:31,526 --> 01:21:35,325
You have a great life ahead of you. I
got nothing. Matt, don't do this!

945
01:21:35,526 --> 01:21:37,026
God damn it!

946
01:21:37,527 --> 01:21:40,727
Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause
for Mr Goldman Sachs.

947
01:21:44,527 --> 01:21:46,527
Shut the fuck up and drive!

948
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:49,527
- Deal!
- Matt don't do this!

949
01:21:49,528 --> 01:21:51,428
Why are you doing this?

950
01:21:52,528 --> 01:21:55,528
Please don't do this, Matt. Oh my god.

951
01:21:58,529 --> 01:22:04,028
I'm Matt Franklin. I work at Suncoast
Video at the mall...

952
01:22:04,054 --> 01:22:06,554
...and I still live with my parents!

953
01:22:09,131 --> 01:22:10,631
You suck!

954
01:22:11,530 --> 01:22:16,330
I don't know what I'm doing up here.
I'm scared. And you know what...

955
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:21,631
I have been so afraid of my life, that I
have missed my life.

956
01:22:22,532 --> 01:22:25,532
But I'm like all of you. We're
all scared!

957
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:28,032
I mean c'mon. Admit it.

958
01:22:28,532 --> 01:22:31,032
We're all trying to be something that
we're not.

959
01:22:32,533 --> 01:22:35,032
But tonight, all of that changes.

960
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:40,933
Tonight, I'm not afraid. Tonight, I got
one thing to say to all that bullshit!

961
01:22:43,534 --> 01:22:46,034
Fuck it.

962
01:23:00,763 --> 01:23:01,963
Kyle... Kyle... I'm begging you.

963
01:23:01,989 --> 01:23:03,189
Please don't let him do this.

964
01:23:03,214 --> 01:23:05,614
No, honey. It's actually really safe.

965
01:23:05,640 --> 01:23:08,940
Relax. He's gonna roll down this hill
right, you see the bend...

966
01:23:08,965 --> 01:23:11,665
...it actually goes up hill, right. You
know how gravity works, right?

967
01:23:11,691 --> 01:23:14,091
He's just gonna stop. It's gonna be
gentle.

968
01:23:14,117 --> 01:23:15,717
And, it's gonna be choice!

969
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:18,942
Look! Look! I'm telling you, that's my
brother and I love him...

970
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:20,168
...and I don't want you to do this!

971
01:23:20,193 --> 01:23:23,693
Oh... did I say it was going to be choice?
I did, so cool out!

972
01:23:28,420 --> 01:23:32,520
Yeah, let's make some noise for
Matt Franklin!

973
01:23:42,949 --> 01:23:44,149
On three!

974
01:23:44,974 --> 01:23:46,174
Three!

975
01:23:57,503 --> 01:23:59,303
Oh shit! Oh Shit!

976
01:24:13,545 --> 01:24:14,845
Shit!

977
01:24:15,045 --> 01:24:16,545
Matt!

978
01:24:23,546 --> 01:24:25,046
A my god.

979
01:24:26,547 --> 01:24:28,047
Holy christ.

980
01:24:37,047 --> 01:24:38,047
Oh shit!

981
01:24:45,549 --> 01:24:47,049
Fuck!

982
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:49,049
Oh my god!

983
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:50,750
Fuck me! Fuck me!

984
01:25:15,552 --> 01:25:18,052
Shit. Help!

985
01:25:18,553 --> 01:25:20,053
Fuck!

986
01:25:36,555 --> 01:25:39,054
- Give me your truck!
- Honey, the road is not supposed to do that.

987
01:25:39,555 --> 01:25:42,055
- Give me your fucking keys!
- Relax.

988
01:25:42,556 --> 01:25:45,055
- Don't fucking touch me.
- I did not know the road bends like that.

989
01:25:45,556 --> 01:25:47,056
I'll drive.

990
01:26:27,061 --> 01:26:28,061
Matt!

991
01:26:28,061 --> 01:26:29,561
Matt!

992
01:26:29,562 --> 01:26:32,061
No, no no.

993
01:26:38,562 --> 01:26:40,062
Are you ok? You ok?

994
01:26:40,562 --> 01:26:42,062
Holy Shit!

995
01:26:42,563 --> 01:26:47,062
- You were the?
- I rode the fucking ball!

996
01:26:56,564 --> 01:26:58,564
- Oh hello.
- Thank god.

997
01:26:58,565 --> 01:27:00,065
Matt!

998
01:27:01,666 --> 01:27:03,065
Take him.

999
01:27:04,565 --> 01:27:07,565
Matt, don't ever do that again,
you hear me!?

1000
01:27:07,566 --> 01:27:09,565
That's not a problem.

1001
01:27:20,767 --> 01:27:23,267
Can I have your phone number?

1002
01:27:25,568 --> 01:27:29,068
I just want to take you out to dinner.
Or like a movie.

1003
01:27:30,569 --> 01:27:32,068
Just hang out with you.

1004
01:27:32,568 --> 01:27:35,068
Matt you were a loser in high school.

1005
01:27:35,569 --> 01:27:40,568
Now you're just a loser who rode the
ball and fucked me!

1006
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:45,870
Are you happy?

1007
01:27:46,571 --> 01:27:48,070
No.

1008
01:27:48,570 --> 01:27:51,370
I'm so sorry I lied to you.

1009
01:27:52,571 --> 01:27:54,271
I'm so sorry, Tori.

1010
01:27:54,571 --> 01:27:57,071
I'll leave you alone now.

1011
01:27:58,572 --> 01:28:00,072
I promise.

1012
01:28:04,572 --> 01:28:06,072
Matt!

1013
01:28:06,573 --> 01:28:11,072
818 404-7327

1014
01:28:15,574 --> 01:28:18,073
And that was pretty impressive.

1015
01:28:29,576 --> 01:28:31,576
Matt. Hey Matt!

1016
01:28:34,076 --> 01:28:36,676
My friend Matt Franklin!

1017
01:28:42,577 --> 01:28:44,077
So it all worked out!

1018
01:28:44,577 --> 01:28:46,677
You were happy when you read
that letter tonight.

1019
01:28:46,678 --> 01:28:47,978
- No I was not happy.
- Yes.

1020
01:28:48,078 --> 01:28:49,277
- I was not.
- Yes you were.

1021
01:28:49,278 --> 01:28:51,378
- I was not happy.
- I saw it. I just want you to admit it!

1022
01:28:52,578 --> 01:28:54,378
What? Admit what?

1023
01:28:54,579 --> 01:28:56,578
That I don't want my baby to leave
the nest?

1024
01:28:56,578 --> 01:28:58,078
Is that why you're mad at me?

1025
01:28:59,579 --> 01:29:03,379
- I'm canceling the movers, Kyle.
- Whoa, what does that mean?

1026
01:29:03,579 --> 01:29:06,079
You know what it means.

1027
01:29:06,580 --> 01:29:08,480
Honey, you said yes tonight.

1028
01:29:08,580 --> 01:29:11,579
- Yeah I know.
- Oh shit, Wenders.

1029
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:14,380
Don't do this to me.

1030
01:29:14,581 --> 01:29:18,081
I'm begging you don't, don't do it.

1031
01:29:21,582 --> 01:29:23,582
I'm doing it!

1032
01:29:36,583 --> 01:29:41,083
You just screwed with my heart.

1033
01:29:48,585 --> 01:29:53,084
You know what? I don't know what the hell
I'm gonna do with myself now.

1034
01:29:54,586 --> 01:29:58,085
Hell I don't know what to do with myself while
I'm thinking about what to do with myself.

1035
01:30:01,587 --> 01:30:04,087
You know, that's what college is for.

1036
01:30:06,087 --> 01:30:10,387
- There's a lot of this.
- No, not right now.

1037
01:30:11,588 --> 01:30:13,587
And there's also a lot of this...

1038
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:27,089
You're beginning to make a lot of sense.

1039
01:30:36,590 --> 01:30:41,090
We should... probably say goodbye, before
I screw this up again.

1040
01:30:41,592 --> 01:30:45,091
- Ok.
- Ok.

1041
01:30:56,593 --> 01:31:01,592
- That was bold!
- That's the scariest thing I did all night!

1042
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:04,400
- Who wants breakfast?
- Yeah... yikes!
