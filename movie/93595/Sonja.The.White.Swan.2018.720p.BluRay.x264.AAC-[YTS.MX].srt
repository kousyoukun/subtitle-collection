3
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,629
Sun, ice, skates.

4
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:43,013
Mommy, daddy, leif, winning.

5
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,470
Sun, ice, skates.

6
00:01:46,565 --> 00:01:50,524
Mommy, daddy, leif, winning.

7
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:55,688
Sun, ice, skates.

8
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,866
Mommy, daddy, leif, winning.

9
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:01,739
Come on!

10
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,615
Nice. Well done, leif!

11
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,919
Leif? Go help Sonja.

12
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,375
Put on your mittens. It's cold.

13
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,798
Do them up tightly, leif.

14
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:29,475
Come, Sonja. I'll teach you.

15
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,026
Niels! Look at Sonja!

16
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,078
She's known as the white swan.

17
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,453
In first place,
the olympic champion,

18
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,999
Sonja henie!

19
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:32,622
Come, leif.

20
00:03:40,846 --> 00:03:42,802
There's someone here to see you.

21
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:23,695
Just get someone else
to take over the shop.

22
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:28,401
How hard can it be?
Dad's never there anyway.

23
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:32,363
That's because I'm there.

24
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:38,077
I don't want to go without you.
I need my brother in America.

25
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,083
Now we can both
do what we do best.

26
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,086
You'll skate,
I'll run a business.

27
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,042
Is that what you want?

28
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,427
Yes.

29
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,642
Then I won't go.

30
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,543
Of course you're going.

31
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,280
Give me a ticket.

32
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:06,732
I like her.

33
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:27,458
Sonja? Are you ready?

34
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,076
Right, dad?

35
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,965
Let's call leif.

36
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:15,302
- He needs to get over here.
- Certainly.

37
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:42,829
Hello? Have I reached henie fur?

38
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:45,711
I'm an old lady calling
from Los Angeles.

39
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,418
I'm in desperate need of a fur.

40
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:53,799
It is your closing-out sale,
right?

41
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,383
Yes.

42
00:14:55,478 --> 00:14:58,891
Would you bring me a fur?

43
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,517
Absolutely.

44
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,369
First!

45
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,393
Go, Sonja!

46
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,324
Why didn't gerd come with you?

47
00:15:57,415 --> 00:15:59,531
You could live here, you know.

48
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,491
It would be too crowded.

49
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,374
You, me, mom, dad and gerd?

50
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,669
You're my family.

51
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,419
It's not that simple.

52
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:18,304
So the business went bust.
That's in the past now.

53
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,053
Not for dad.

54
00:16:26,861 --> 00:16:28,943
You'll have to think
of something.

55
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,068
What? I don't have any skills.

56
00:16:37,622 --> 00:16:40,113
We'll start a business.

57
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,665
You can be the ceo.

58
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:48,501
Come. Let's play bandy.

59
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,291
Nice, leif!

60
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,348
Pass the ball, leif!

61
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,724
Here! Dad!

62
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,271
Yeah!

63
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,985
Get over here.

64
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:12,937
Not bad! Goodness me.

65
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,070
Go!

66
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,240
Let go!

67
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,081
Here!

68
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:28,786
Get the ball, leif!

69
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,962
- Yes!
- It was out.

70
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,135
- It was in.
- The ball was out.

71
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,134
No way, it went past his foot.

72
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:41,136
- It's in!
- I saw it!

73
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:42,808
That's impossible.

74
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,352
- The ball was out.
- Yeah, right.

75
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:49,352
Mom? The ball is in when it's
past dad's foot, right?

76
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,900
Blow the whistle.

77
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:55,276
- The ball was out!
- It was in.

78
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,324
This is bullshit. Fuck!

79
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,242
Leif...

80
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,614
Niels!

81
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,286
Oh my god! You came!

82
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:12,505
Thanks.

83
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:15,459
- You want one of these?
- I'll take all I can get.

84
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,089
Finally reunited. Cheers.

85
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:23,424
Cheers.

86
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,852
So, are you here to stay?

87
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:30,056
- Sure, in New York.
- It's warmer here.

88
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:31,766
Definitely.

89
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,988
- Is it?
- Yes.

90
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,532
As far as I'm concerned,

91
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,783
most of my clients are European,

92
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:48,583
so the Atlantic
is where it's at.

93
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,001
Sonja.

94
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,578
Time for bed.

95
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,462
What? Nine o'clock?

96
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,966
We're starting at five
in the morning.

97
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:04,174
We're coloring the ice black.

98
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:08,762
Maybe you'd like to come visit
the set?

99
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:14,067
L... I've got an early flight
tomorrow.

100
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:21,032
Maybe some other time.

101
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,779
It would be easier
if you lived here.

102
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,110
Yeah.

103
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:27,368
It's much better here, isn't it?

104
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,039
Oh, you mean here?

105
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,751
Right. Well...

106
00:19:33,756 --> 00:19:35,667
Well, why not?

107
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,467
Yeah.

108
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:43,921
You'll have to promise
to come back soon.

109
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:56,230
Leif.

110
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,936
I brought something from Norway.

111
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,067
It's from when we were little.

112
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,819
- What?
- I crushed you at bandy.

113
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,697
What's this?

114
00:20:05,788 --> 00:20:07,870
It's me!

115
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:11,415
This is going up on the wall
right away.

116
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,462
Just...

117
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,463
Let me know
if you're in New York.

118
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:24,216
We'll play some bandy.

119
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,056
Or something.

120
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:38,317
Are you coming? Sure.

121
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:42,738
Watch out for that one.
He's a cheater.

122
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,825
Come on!

123
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,374
Niels!

124
00:21:01,469 --> 00:21:05,257
Niels, come stand
next to leif and Sonja.

125
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:09,590
We're having a match!
Selma, hurry.

126
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:34,865
Sonja? Come here.

127
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:39,248
Can you do that again?

128
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:47,049
- Where did you learn that?
- Leif taught me.

129
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,395
Please welcome
our next contestant.

130
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:34,058
Pack your things.

131
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,886
You can untie your skates
yourself.

132
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:26,068
That's enough.

133
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,531
There.

134
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:52,928
You have to get up at five.

135
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,632
You'll wake me.

136
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,471
Bye.

137
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,809
- Here.
- Thanks.

138
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,310
Have a nice trip!

139
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,755
There.

140
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,193
Cheers.

141
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,535
What's this?

142
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:33,618
I've found a piece of land.

143
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:37,204
Not far from your place,
a few miles down the coast.

144
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,881
You're going to be a farmer?

145
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,335
I have to do something.
I'm a business man, after all.

146
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,012
You were a business man.

147
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:53,846
It's just some lots.
I might buy a couple.

148
00:28:53,941 --> 00:28:56,648
Why don't we get all of them?

149
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,402
We have a business, right?

150
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:02,696
You can build a village.

151
00:29:09,373 --> 00:29:11,830
Plots or houses.

152
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,876
It's going to be expensive.

153
00:29:16,964 --> 00:29:18,704
If it's not expensive,
it's cheap.

154
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,630
You should do something
you know.

155
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:23,550
I should get leif's
wife down here

156
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:25,343
so they can start
making little sonjas

157
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,967
that I can teach to skate.

158
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:30,632
It's my money.

159
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,055
I think it's an excellent idea.

160
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,069
What's the ground like?
Is it flat?

161
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,898
- Sunny, shady...?
- Quite flat.

162
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,622
Remember to smile, gerd.

163
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,248
Try to...

164
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,832
Laugh a little.

165
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,338
You know what I mean.

166
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,178
Overbearing.

167
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:18,595
You can rub my feet.

168
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:28,439
It's the new pair. They're so
tight, half of my foot is numb.

169
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,960
Dad?

170
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:47,856
First!

171
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,319
Hey. There you are.

172
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,825
The car's ready.

173
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:52,786
I found your old skates
a few days ago.

174
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,371
You should bring them
for little Wilhelm.

175
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,548
Yeah.

176
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,421
Maybe.

177
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:04,297
They're yours, after all.

178
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,849
Thank you.

179
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:08,472
Hey...

180
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:12,772
There have been some delays
at henie hills.

181
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,143
The bank won't give us any money
before it's done.

182
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:19,320
How much do you need?

183
00:44:19,407 --> 00:44:21,398
Well...

184
00:44:28,416 --> 00:44:30,828
Is mom all right? Sure.

185
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:35,829
She says hello.

186
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:46,760
- More?
- Maybe a little.

187
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,057
That'll do. Thanks.

188
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:41,857
Why the hell did you
pick this car?

189
00:45:41,948 --> 00:45:44,815
I thought it was a lovely car.

190
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:47,446
- And now?
- That it was a bad idea.

191
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,242
Fuck!

192
00:47:15,166 --> 00:47:17,202
Are you done sulking?

193
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:50,226
Leif, come on!

194
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:04,641
Leif! We're over here.

195
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:08,637
Nice!

196
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:30,372
- How are you feeling?
- Great.

197
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,998
Nobody speaks english.

198
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:42,505
Cheers.

199
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,711
Hello, there.

200
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:48,266
Niels! It's so good to see you.

201
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,328
So, you're...

202
01:01:18,550 --> 01:01:20,256
How fun.

203
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:23,425
Good to see you, niels.

204
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,094
You, too.

205
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:29,887
- Where are you staying?
- At leif's.

206
01:01:31,188 --> 01:01:32,974
You could have stayed here.

207
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:36,397
Yes, but I wanted to see
the kids.

208
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:16,976
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

209
01:03:10,870 --> 01:03:12,735
Well, he's right.

210
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:10,440
Come hug your aunt Sonja.

211
01:12:26,259 --> 01:12:30,093
They've taken almost
all of my cars.

212
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,966
Next, they'll take my house.

213
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:40,845
There's nothing left
in the bank.

214
01:12:43,276 --> 01:12:45,267
You should never
have fired Arthur.

215
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:47,693
Shut up.

216
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:50,738
I need money, and you've taken
everything I have.

217
01:12:50,825 --> 01:12:53,282
You mean everything
you've been given.

218
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:57,278
I've followed you my whole life.

219
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:00,872
Henie hills is my project.

220
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,872
And I paid for it.

221
01:13:09,594 --> 01:13:11,255
So...

222
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:15,175
What do you say?

223
01:13:15,266 --> 01:13:17,928
You're not getting any money.

224
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:23,888
Winnie left me.

225
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,485
He was only interested
in your money.

226
01:13:34,535 --> 01:13:35,991
And you weren't?

227
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:54,001
Mom?

228
01:14:02,188 --> 01:14:05,055
Why don't we have a look at

229
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,014
your will, one of these days?

230
01:14:09,737 --> 01:14:12,194
Sure.

231
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,738
Of course we can.

232
01:14:17,370 --> 01:14:18,985
Good.

233
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,836
I'll call you.

234
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,332
Sun, ice, skates.

235
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:17,965
Mommy, daddy, leif.

236
01:15:18,055 --> 01:15:21,639
Four, five, six, seven,

237
01:15:21,726 --> 01:15:25,139
eight, nine, ten, eleven,

238
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:28,596
twelve, thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen.

239
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:33,856
Sun, skates, mommy, daddy, leif.

240
01:15:42,538 --> 01:15:44,904
- Boo!
- Sonja!

241
01:15:44,999 --> 01:15:47,285
What are you doing?

242
01:20:00,629 --> 01:20:05,293
The papers are signed,
so the will should be sorted.

243
01:20:05,384 --> 01:20:07,625
That's great.

244
01:20:14,518 --> 01:20:16,759
What is this?

245
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:25,442
Okay, let's go.

246
01:20:26,447 --> 01:20:28,688
Let's go. We're leaving.

247
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:30,363
You're scared of her!

248
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,947
I wish I never taught
you how to skate.

249
01:20:44,882 --> 01:20:46,873
Pack your things, mom.

250
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,209
You're staying with me.

251
01:24:23,642 --> 01:24:26,634
I accept the following.

252
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:30,641
One: To transfer to Sonja henie,
whenever she pleases,

253
01:24:30,732 --> 01:24:34,145
my share of the property
at landgen, Oslo, Norway,

254
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:37,273
as well as all the furniture
in said property.

255
01:24:37,364 --> 01:24:40,026
To issue and transfer
to my daughter

256
01:24:40,117 --> 01:24:43,985
when she sees fit."

257
01:24:45,581 --> 01:24:47,196
Drunk!

258
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:49,282
You've lived off my money
all your life.

259
01:24:49,376 --> 01:24:53,369
Freeloading and whining.
Feeling sorry for yourself.

260
01:24:53,463 --> 01:24:56,500
Didn't get to go to school
because we lived in finse.

261
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:58,799
The business failed
because of the war.

262
01:24:58,885 --> 01:25:02,844
You know what you are?
You're nothing.

263
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:06,014
You get everything,
and you sell henie hills?

264
01:28:03,695 --> 01:28:05,731
Nice of you to stop by.

265
01:28:06,990 --> 01:28:09,606
Are you here for work?

266
01:28:09,701 --> 01:28:11,612
No, I...

267
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,573
Look at you.

268
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:17,830
Yes.

269
01:28:17,918 --> 01:28:20,250
I went to see leif.

270
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:24,500
Henie hills is all he has.

271
01:28:28,970 --> 01:28:30,835
Yes.

272
01:28:37,687 --> 01:28:39,973
That's...

273
01:28:56,122 --> 01:28:58,078
Let's see...

274
01:29:00,544 --> 01:29:02,910
Bought it yesterday.

275
01:29:03,004 --> 01:29:05,336
That's why I'm in Los Angeles.

276
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,214
To buy art?

277
01:29:08,301 --> 01:29:11,668
A year from now,
it will have doubled in value.

278
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:15,221
Oh. It's that easy?

279
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:19,221
Well, most of it
hever amounts to much.

280
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:21,894
But this one will.

281
01:29:21,982 --> 01:29:25,019
It kind of looks like
skating trails.

282
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,811
Yeah?

283
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,857
You're giving me an autograph?

284
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:12,362
What are you thinking?

285
01:30:13,992 --> 01:30:16,358
That I'll put it on my wall

286
01:30:16,453 --> 01:30:19,445
so I can brag about knowing you?

287
01:30:23,710 --> 01:30:27,248
I didn't invite you in here
to get told off.

288
01:30:41,686 --> 01:30:43,517
I'm sorry.

289
01:30:53,156 --> 01:30:55,522
You've always liked me, niels.

290
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:00,619
In many ways,
it's always been the two of us.

291
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:08,494
I think I'll...

292
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:10,544
Be off.

293
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:14,667
Did I say something wrong?

294
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,298
It's always been the two of us?

295
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,930
Yes?

296
01:31:39,828 --> 01:31:41,489
Bye.

297
01:31:43,081 --> 01:31:45,823
Don't go. I want you to stay.

298
01:31:45,917 --> 01:31:47,873
Why?

299
01:31:47,961 --> 01:31:50,373
I like you.

300
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:54,247
I told you,
I've always liked you.

301
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:57,334
No, you said that
I've always liked you.

302
01:31:59,848 --> 01:32:02,681
What's the difference?

303
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:10,184
So, tomorrow the money

304
01:32:10,275 --> 01:32:13,312
from henie hills will be
transferred

305
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:17,112
to some ice hall in rio,
is that right?

306
01:32:18,450 --> 01:32:19,940
Yes.

307
01:32:24,205 --> 01:32:26,821
Well, I'm letting him
keep his house.

308
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:29,999
Not his livelihood, though.

309
01:32:30,086 --> 01:32:32,953
Leif's a terrible business man.

310
01:32:34,507 --> 01:32:38,841
I've been paying
for that place all along.

311
01:32:38,928 --> 01:32:42,170
I probably would have done so
the rest of my life.

312
01:32:42,265 --> 01:32:45,598
Do you think you'll make money
again?

313
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:49,344
How rude.

314
01:32:52,484 --> 01:32:54,941
I think you should go
to the kitchen.

315
01:32:55,028 --> 01:32:58,486
Sit down and think it over.

316
01:33:00,742 --> 01:33:02,528
Oh?

317
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:04,280
Think what over?

318
01:33:04,370 --> 01:33:07,032
What's going to happen.

319
01:33:07,123 --> 01:33:09,580
What do you think will happen?

320
01:33:09,667 --> 01:33:15,583
I think rio is
going to be a disaster.

321
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:18,665
You're going to lose
what little you have left.

322
01:33:21,679 --> 01:33:23,340
Right.

323
01:33:25,350 --> 01:33:27,932
You should stay,
if you want me to think.

324
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:31,261
I'm not going to
sit here and think by myself.

325
01:33:31,356 --> 01:33:32,846
What will you do instead?

326
01:33:32,941 --> 01:33:36,399
Get so plastered
that you forget where you are?

327
01:33:36,486 --> 01:33:38,101
Yes.

328
01:33:40,406 --> 01:33:43,068
Right.

329
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:46,276
I'd love to see you in rio.

330
01:33:50,041 --> 01:33:52,623
Yeah.

331
01:49:23,140 --> 01:49:26,132
Sonja henie and niels onstad married
in the summer of 1956

332
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:36,935
Together they built up a
substantial art collection

333
01:49:46,872 --> 01:49:50,535
Sonja henie died the following year
on a flight from Paris to Oslo

334
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:54,539
she had leukemia and fell asleep
with niels' head on her shoulder

335
01:49:58,175 --> 01:50:01,918
leif and Sonja never saw each other again.

336
01:50:31,416 --> 01:50:33,372
I glance at her face

337
01:50:33,460 --> 01:50:36,543
to see if it's been damaged
by the Hollywood make-up.
