1
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:53,906
- Watch it!

2
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,074
More harpoons!

3
00:01:55,074 --> 00:01:56,575
Ready the nets, men!

4
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:58,869
I say kill her 'afore
she comes aboard!

5
00:01:58,869 --> 00:01:59,995
Where is she? Let me see!

6
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,122
Wait. Wait. Wait.

7
00:02:04,208 --> 00:02:05,709
She's a fast one.

8
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,254
- Hand me another!
She's getting away!

9
00:02:08,254 --> 00:02:09,839
I think
she's smilin' at you.

10
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,300
I missed her.

11
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,011
- Another one.
Come on, another one!

12
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,266
Hey! Hey! Hey!

13
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:22,059
Move! Move! Get back!

14
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,644
What are you doing?

15
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,271
- It's a mermaid!
- A mermaid?

16
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:26,522
Use your eyes!

17
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,651
What were you thinking?

18
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:32,403
These are dangerous waters.

19
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,446
And this is a dangerous time.

20
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,365
Tonight's the Coral Moon.

21
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:38,325
They say this is
when the Sea King calls

22
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:40,369
his mermaid daughters together

23
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:41,996
to lure men to their deaths.

24
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,289
- Is that what they say?
- Aye.

25
00:02:43,455 --> 00:02:46,083
Not even the strongest
can resist their spell.

26
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:47,459
It's just an old lore.

27
00:02:53,257 --> 00:02:54,550
Back to work!

28
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,801
Come on, lads.
- You see there?

29
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,261
See what, Hawkins?

30
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,389
Crosswind gust kicked up
the chop, that's all.

31
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:02,433
- That's the Sea King's doing.
- Give me a hand, mate.

32
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:04,810
He'd pull us under himself
if he could.

33
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,854
Sail faster!
Raising the main!

34
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,022
This line's tight.

35
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,274
Where's Prince Eric?

36
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,193
- Up at the bow, Sir Grimsby.

37
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,908
- Whoo!
- Eric!

38
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,076
- What are you doing out there?

39
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:22,578
Get back here at once!

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,706
You ought to stop worrying
so much about me, Grimsby.

41
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,875
Call me selfish,

42
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:29,835
but I do not want
to tell the Queen

43
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,630
that her son fell
overboard on my watch.

44
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,715
And on his birthday,
of all days.

45
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,928
Looks like there's
a Spanish galleon out there

46
00:03:38,928 --> 00:03:40,346
headed toward the mainland.

47
00:03:40,346 --> 00:03:42,056
We could follow it to port,

48
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,891
see what they've brought
to trade.

49
00:03:44,058 --> 00:03:46,852
Our ship is loaded
to the gills as it is.

50
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:48,604
We've risked
our necks out here

51
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,356
for seven weeks already.

52
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,775
We're going home tonight.

53
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:53,943
Eric.

54
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,986
- Pay attention.

55
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,446
I need you to be more careful.

56
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,616
Careful, Grimsby!

57
00:05:57,941 --> 00:06:00,235
My Daughters
of the Seven Seas,

58
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,988
I welcome news
from all of your waters.

59
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:06,450
Tamika, Perla,

60
00:06:06,617 --> 00:06:08,285
it's so good to see you.

61
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:12,164
Caspia, Indira,

62
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:15,375
it fills my heart
to have you all here.

63
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543
Mala,

64
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:18,837
Karina...

65
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,385
Where is Ariel?

66
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,808
Sebastian?

67
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,853
You were supposed to see to it
that Ariel was here.

68
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:37,397
I tried, Your Majesty,

69
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,775
but that child,
she is impossible.

70
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:41,610
I reminded her

71
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,029
about the gathering
just this mornin'.

72
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,198
What more can
one crustacean do?

73
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:49,618
You can go find her.

74
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:51,161
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes.

75
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,412
Right away.

76
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:54,748
"Yes, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:56,375
"Right away, Your Majesty."

78
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,169
How hard can it be
to find a mermaid, after all?

79
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:01,672
If I'm lucky, I'll only have
to search one ocean.

80
00:07:02,589 --> 00:07:06,176
Where are you, child?

81
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:33,579
We aren't supposed to be this
far from the palace, Ariel.

82
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:34,997
- Let's go back.
Oh!

83
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:36,957
How does that work?

84
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:39,293
Come on, Ariel. Please?

85
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:42,087
Oh, Flounder,
stop being such a guppy!

86
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,922
I'm not a guppy.

87
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:54,349
I think we've gone far enough.

88
00:07:57,144 --> 00:07:58,145
Wait.

89
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,980
What is that?

90
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,648
I've never seen that one.

91
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,860
Come on.

92
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,737
Ariel! Wait for me!

93
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,742
You know I can't swim
that fast.

94
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,928
Whoa. Look at all that.

95
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,806
They must have used the ship
for battles or something.

96
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,850
Yeah, great.

97
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,477
Now let's get out of here.

98
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,646
- Getting cold fins?
- Who, me?

99
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,898
- No way.
- Good.

100
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:46,235
Then you can stay out here
and watch for sharks.

101
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:47,736
All right, good.

102
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,529
What?

103
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,406
Ariel, wait!

104
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:07,756
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

105
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,841
Oh, Flounder.

106
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:14,638
Look at this.

107
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:15,806
Whoa.

108
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,392
It's the smallest trident
I've ever seen.

109
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,020
I'm King Flounder,

110
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,856
- Lord of the Seven Seas!

111
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,609
I wonder why a human
would need one that size.

112
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,944
I bet Scuttle will know.

113
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,862
She always does.

114
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,908
Will you relax?

115
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,494
- It's just your reflection.
- Whew.

116
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:38,912
Calm down.

117
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,498
Nothing is going to happen.

118
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:43,250
Flounder, look out!

119
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:19,328
Flounder!

120
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:06,458
You okay, Flounder?

121
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:09,878
Uh, sure. I mean,
I've seen bigger sharks.

122
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:12,047
Just, you know,
you can't back down.

123
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:13,882
You gotta show 'em who's in...

124
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,887
Come back, Flounder.
It's just Scuttle.

125
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,481
Ariel. Hey, kid, how ya doin'?

126
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,525
Don't mind me,
I was just grabbin' a snack.

127
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:33,276
Scuttle, we found
more treasure.

128
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:35,320
Yeah. We went
into this sunken ship,

129
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,905
and it was really creepy.

130
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:38,865
Human stuff. A-ha.

131
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:39,950
All right, all right,
let me see.

132
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,284
Let... Let... Let me see.

133
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:42,661
Any idea what this is?

134
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,704
Oh. Oh, oh, oh!

135
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,997
Wow.

136
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,207
This...

137
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:48,625
This is... Yeah.

138
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:50,419
This is very, very unusual.

139
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:52,796
- What? What is it?
- It's a...

140
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:54,131
It's a dinglehopper.

141
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,383
- A dinglehopper.
- Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:11:56,383 --> 00:12:00,220
Humans use these babies
to style their hair.

143
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:01,847
You just give it
a little twirl,

144
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,266
a little yank, you might
get some pieces with it,

145
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,309
and you're left with
an artistically pleasing

146
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:08,812
conflagration of hair
that humans go nuts for.

147
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:11,231
Really? I would love
to see that.

148
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:12,816
- Can't.
- Flounder.

149
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,942
You know it's true.

150
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,361
Your father still won't let
you go to the surface, huh?

151
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,696
No, it's forbidden.

152
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:20,115
He thinks all humans
are barbarians.

153
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,576
Oh, they're not so bad.

154
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,286
Unless you're a coconut.

155
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,454
They hate coconuts.

156
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,289
I swear, they get
a hold of one,

157
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:30,041
they smash it to pieces,
just like that. It's weird.

158
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,626
- And what's this?
Ariel!

159
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,003
- Swam half across

160
00:12:33,003 --> 00:12:34,546
a whole ocean lookin'
for this child. Ariel!

161
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,630
Ow!

162
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,715
Sebastian!

163
00:12:36,715 --> 00:12:39,009
- Sorry about that!
Ariel!

164
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,469
What are you doin' up there?

165
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,096
Wasting your time
with this know-nothing bird

166
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,681
that can't tell swimmin'
from flyin'?

167
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,267
- Hey!
- I suppose you've completely

168
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,728
forgotten tonight's
the Coral Moon?

169
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:50,896
Oh, no!

170
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:52,189
Oh, yes!

171
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,399
The gatherin'
of King Triton's daughters,

172
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,484
minus one.

173
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:57,486
My father's gonna kill me!

174
00:12:57,486 --> 00:12:59,196
- Sorry, Scuttle, gotta go!
- Yeah, yeah.

175
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,822
All right, sweetie. Me too.

176
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:01,990
Gotta get some air.

177
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:21,468
<i>Yes, hurry home, Princess.</i>

178
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,345
<i>We wouldn't want to be late</i>

179
00:13:23,345 --> 00:13:26,014
<i>for Daddy's gathering, now,
would we?</i>

180
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:29,351
Perhaps I'll join them.

181
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:32,646
Oh, wait, what a shame.

182
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,898
It seems that
Big Brother forgot

183
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:38,068
to invite Auntie Ursula
to the party.

184
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:39,611
Again.

185
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:42,656
Oh, I should be the one
throwing the parties,

186
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:45,575
- not waiting on an invitation.

187
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:50,789
Oh, the feasts we had
when I lived in the palace!

188
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:58,755
And now look at me,
the family pariah.

189
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,467
Wasting away
to practically nothing.

190
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:06,304
Banished and exiled,
driven halfway to madness

191
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:11,977
in this dim little crevice
for 15 long years.

192
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:16,606
While Daddy and his spoiled
little mer-brats

193
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,733
celebrate the Coral Moon.

194
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:24,197
Well, I'll give them
something to celebrate.

195
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,160
I may have finally found
Daddy's weakness.

196
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:30,996
Yes.

197
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:36,626
Red's fascination with humans
might be just the opening

198
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,212
I've been waiting for.

199
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,383
It is irresponsible.

200
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,759
Your sisters are only here

201
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,511
for one phase
of the Coral Moon.

202
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:47,887
Can you imagine
any one of them

203
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,765
- missing the gathering?
No. You're right.

204
00:14:50,932 --> 00:14:53,184
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't Ariel's fault.

205
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:56,187
We... We... We were exploring,
and a shark chased us and...

206
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,439
Shark?

207
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:59,232
So, you went
to the shipwrecks again?

208
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:02,569
Those waters are dangerous.

209
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,070
You don't have
to worry about me.

210
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:06,406
Well, I do worry,
my little one. I do worry.

211
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,408
This obsession with humans
has to stop.

212
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,285
I just want to know more
about them.

213
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:11,911
You know all you need to know.

214
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,288
I barely know anything.

215
00:15:13,455 --> 00:15:15,081
You won't even let us go
to the surface.

216
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:17,208
Why do you have
to be so strong-minded?

217
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,127
- Just like your mother. It...
- I am her daughter.

218
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:21,004
Yes, foolish enough
to be taken

219
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:22,088
with the human world.

220
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:23,757
If you would just try
to understand...

221
00:15:23,757 --> 00:15:24,841
Well, I have tried.

222
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,760
I have tried
to understand you long enough.

223
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,511
But as long as you live
in my ocean,

224
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,221
you'll obey my rules.

225
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:32,223
Do you understand that?

226
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:47,238
Children, you give them
an inch,

227
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:48,907
- they swim all over you.

228
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:50,533
Was I too hard on her?

229
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,785
Definitely not.

230
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,495
It's like I always say,

231
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,414
"Children got to live
by their parent's rules."

232
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,750
You're absolutely right, Sebastian.

233
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,001
Hmm.

234
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,045
My Ariel needs
constant supervision.

235
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:03,338
Constant.

236
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:04,756
Someone to watch over her.

237
00:16:04,923 --> 00:16:06,883
All the time, day and night.

238
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,718
And you're just the crab
to do it.

239
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:09,803
I am just the crab to...

240
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,304
No, wait, that's not... What?

241
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,264
No, see, I serve you,
Your Majesty,

242
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:15,266
as your honored majordomo.

243
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,644
There is no better way
you can serve me

244
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,104
than to make sure
my little one

245
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,188
stays out of trouble.

246
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,690
- But I...
Yes?

247
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:22,857
Go.

248
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,110
Go.

249
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,612
Yes, Your Majesty.

250
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:30,490
How do I get myself
into these situations?

251
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,283
I'm an educated crustacean.

252
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,576
I got options.

253
00:16:33,743 --> 00:16:34,869
I don't need this.

254
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,329
I should be advising the King,

255
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,290
not chasing after
some headstrong teenager.

256
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,077
Ariel, are you okay?

257
00:17:16,244 --> 00:17:17,871
He doesn't even hear me.

258
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:20,373
I'm just not like him.

259
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:22,375
I don't see things
the way he does.

260
00:17:23,752 --> 00:17:25,211
And I...

261
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,131
I don't see how a world
that makes

262
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:31,342
such wonderful things
could be so bad.

263
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:35,680
<i>Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?</i>

264
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:39,684
<i>Wouldn't you think
My collection's complete?</i>

265
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:42,479
<i>Wouldn't you think
I'm the girl</i>

266
00:17:42,645 --> 00:17:46,065
<i>The girl who has ev'rything?</i>

267
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,154
<i>Look at this trove
Treasures untold</i>

268
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:54,908
<i>How many wonders
Can one cavern hold?</i>

269
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,702
<i>Looking around here
You'd think</i>

270
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:02,081
<i>Sure, she's got ev'rything</i>

271
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,919
<i>I've got gadgets
And gizmos aplenty</i>

272
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,839
<i>I've got "who's its"
And "what's its" galore</i>

273
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:11,966
<i>You want thingamabobs?</i>

274
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,968
<i>I got 20</i>

275
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,346
<i>But who cares?</i>

276
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:19,182
<i>No big deal</i>

277
00:18:19,349 --> 00:18:25,522
<i>I want more</i>

278
00:18:27,023 --> 00:18:30,026
<i>I wanna be
Where the people are</i>

279
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:35,031
<i>I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancing</i>

280
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:37,742
<i>Walkin' around on those...</i>

281
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:40,912
<i>What do you call 'em?
Oh! Feet!</i>

282
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:46,918
<i>Flippin' your fins
You don't get too far</i>

283
00:18:47,085 --> 00:18:50,588
<i>Legs are required
For jumpin', dancin'</i>

284
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:52,966
<i>Strollin' along down a...</i>

285
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,009
<i>What's that word again?</i>

286
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:57,303
<i>Street</i>

287
00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:01,474
<i>Up where they walk
Up where they run</i>

288
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,812
<i>Up where they stay all day
In the sun</i>

289
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,691
<i>Wanderin' free
Wish I could be</i>

290
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:14,028
<i>Part of that world</i>

291
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,655
<i>What would I give</i>

292
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:21,035
<i>If I could live
Out of these waters?</i>

293
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:23,121
<i>What would I pay</i>

294
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:29,127
<i>To spend a day
Warm on the sand?</i>

295
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:33,256
<i>Bet ya on land they understand</i>

296
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:37,677
<i>Bet they don't
Reprimand their daughters</i>

297
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,347
<i>Bright young women
Sick of swimmin'</i>

298
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:45,685
<i>Ready to stand</i>

299
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:50,523
<i>And ready to know
What the people know</i>

300
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,944
<i>Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers</i>

301
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:57,280
<i>What's a fire
And why does it...</i>

302
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,990
<i>What's the word?</i>

303
00:19:59,157 --> 00:20:01,326
<i>Burn?</i>

304
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,494
<i>When's it my turn?</i>

305
00:20:03,661 --> 00:20:05,496
<i>Wouldn't I love</i>

306
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:12,629
<i>Love to explore
That shore up above</i>

307
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:22,722
<i>Out of the sea</i>

308
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:32,023
<i>Wish I could be</i>

309
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:41,240
<i>Part of that world</i>

310
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,440
Ariel!

311
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:15,608
Don't!

312
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:20,530
Oh, no, no, no!

313
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,240
What does she think she doin'?

314
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:14,208
Oh!
Oh!

315
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:17,754
<i>I'll tell you a tale
Of the bottomless blue</i>

316
00:22:17,754 --> 00:22:21,049
<i>And it's hey to the starboard
Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

317
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,302
<i>Look out, lad, a mermaid
Be waitin' for you</i>

318
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:27,013
<i>In mysterious fathoms below</i>

319
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:40,068
Who's an old man?

320
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:42,820
<i>I'll sing you a song
Of the King of the Sea!</i>

321
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,407
<i>And it's hey to the starboard
Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

322
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:49,702
<i>The ruler of all of the oceans
And seas</i>

323
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:53,372
<i>In mysterious fathoms below
Heave ho!</i>

324
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,333
<i>Heave ho!</i>

325
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,501
<i>Heave ho!</i>

326
00:22:56,667 --> 00:22:57,668
Enough!

327
00:22:57,668 --> 00:22:58,753
<i>Heave ho!</i>

328
00:22:58,753 --> 00:22:59,879
Thank you, gentlemen.

329
00:23:00,046 --> 00:23:01,506
Oh, let's have
a dance, aye.

330
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:03,382
Oh, come on.
It's his birthday.

331
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:05,635
- Oh, come on, Grimsby.

332
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,428
What's wrong with me
having a little fun?

333
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:08,638
Everyone else is.

334
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:10,681
You, sire,
are not everyone else.

335
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,266
It's time
you separated yourself

336
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,351
from the rest of the crew.

337
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,394
- Oh, but I'm one of them.
- And behave in a manner

338
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,980
more becoming
of a future king.

339
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,858
You mean, be more
like my father was?

340
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,401
Cut off from the rest
of the world.

341
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,320
Oh, Eric,
you know what I mean.

342
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,823
When you came to us
21 years ago,

343
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,491
the King and Queen took you in

344
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,327
and treated you
as one of their own.

345
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:32,787
Now that you've come of age...

346
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,163
Max.

347
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:35,248
Max!

348
00:23:35,623 --> 00:23:36,999
What are you doing over there?
Come here, boy!

349
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:38,668
Come on. Come on.

350
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,711
Go on.

351
00:23:40,711 --> 00:23:42,338
And now
that you have come of age,

352
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:45,383
your responsibilities
are at home.

353
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:47,009
Your father would
have expected that.

354
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,761
Yes, trapped inside
that castle

355
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,388
in isolation and fear.

356
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,181
I can't do it.

357
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,225
I believe a little
fear may be advisable, sire.

358
00:23:54,225 --> 00:23:55,434
Grimsby, you're not listening.

359
00:23:56,227 --> 00:23:57,854
I want to be
a different kind of leader.

360
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,522
That's the whole reason
we're on this voyage,

361
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:00,773
don't you see?

362
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,025
We have to stay open
to what's out here.

363
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:05,653
That's the only way
our island can grow.

364
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,989
Eric,
think what you risk.

365
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:09,699
I can't explain it, Grims.

366
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,576
It's in my blood.

367
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:12,827
Even now, I...

368
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,414
I feel there's something
out here calling to me.

369
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,836
Storm coming in fast.

370
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:27,258
- Squall coming in!
Squall!

371
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:28,551
All hands on deck!

372
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:29,927
All hands on deck!

373
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,596
Batten down the hatches
and crates!

374
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,680
Yes, sir!

375
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:34,891
Tie 'em down!

376
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,103
Get the ropes in!
Tie her down!

377
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:41,105
Man the pumps!
Man the pumps!

378
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:43,649
Pull the main sail!

379
00:24:48,905 --> 00:24:50,615
Clew up
and stow the main course!

380
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:51,866
We're over-canvassed!

381
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,160
Brail up
the foresail!

382
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:07,632
Stow all of the sails!

383
00:25:09,634 --> 00:25:10,760
Clew that!

384
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,432
Drop it down. Open up!

385
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,584
Oi, lads!

386
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:45,169
Fire!

387
00:25:50,758 --> 00:25:52,051
Grab the port side!

388
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:04,397
Lifeboats! Abandon ship!

389
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,606
Abandon ship!

390
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,066
Abandon ship!

391
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,484
Into the water, boy!

392
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,152
- Go! Now!
Jump!

393
00:26:11,028 --> 00:26:12,071
Get in. Get in!

394
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,239
Jump!

395
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:30,006
Give me
your hand, boy.

396
00:26:30,006 --> 00:26:31,632
Come on, get up. Hold on!

397
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,551
Boy! In here. All right?

398
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:36,846
- Max.

399
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:57,867
That's it. That's it, boy.
Come on, boy. That's it.

400
00:27:00,244 --> 00:27:02,455
All right, boy. Go on. Go on.

401
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,626
Come here, boy!

402
00:27:08,294 --> 00:27:09,962
- Max! Come on!
Good boy!

403
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:17,928
Come on.

404
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:19,221
Come on, Max.

405
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,306
There you go.

406
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:22,558
- I got ya.
- Eric!

407
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,716
Oh, no.

408
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,427
Ahh! Get off me, you fool!

409
00:29:21,594 --> 00:29:24,221
Oh, hey. Didn't expect
to find you here.

410
00:29:24,388 --> 00:29:26,807
And I really didn't expect
to find her here.

411
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,851
Uh-uh. Hey.
You listen to me, bird.

412
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,312
The King can never
hear of this.

413
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,231
We are going to forget
this ever happened.

414
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,192
- Ow!
- Are you listenin' to me?

415
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,359
Yes.

416
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,695
You won't tell him,
I won't tell him,

417
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,947
and I will stay in one piece.
You got it?

418
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,241
Got it. Sorry,
what'd you say again?

419
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,743
I'm a dead crab.

420
00:29:56,629 --> 00:30:00,883
<i>What would I give
To live where you are?</i>

421
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:07,932
<i>What would I pay
To stay here beside you?</i>

422
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:15,064
<i>What would I do
To see you smiling at me?</i>

423
00:30:17,775 --> 00:30:20,819
<i>Where would we walk?</i>

424
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,614
<i>Where would we run</i>

425
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:29,411
<i>If we could stay all day
In the sun?</i>

426
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,206
<i>Just you and me</i>

427
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,875
<i>And I could be</i>

428
00:30:34,875 --> 00:30:40,881
<i>Part of your world?</i>

429
00:30:43,801 --> 00:30:45,469
Check the cove, men.

430
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,304
Checking the cove!

431
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,558
Eyes peeled!
On the other side!

432
00:30:50,558 --> 00:30:52,476
Move it, lads.
Follow me.

433
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:56,355
Down on the sand!

434
00:30:57,356 --> 00:30:58,482
Over here!

435
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:01,193
This way.

436
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,491
Is he breathing?

437
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,493
He's alive.

438
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,036
Alert the Queen!

439
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:12,955
- You lead, mate.
Go quickly, lads.

440
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,832
Back to the castle.

441
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:18,711
Go ahead.

442
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:21,088
Go, let's go!

443
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,340
Let's go.

444
00:31:24,967 --> 00:31:27,553
<i>I don't know when</i>

445
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,180
<i>I don't know how</i>

446
00:31:30,347 --> 00:31:37,354
<i>But I know something's
Starting right now</i>

447
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,568
<i>Watch and you'll see</i>

448
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:47,406
<i>Someday I'll be</i>

449
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:54,913
<i>Part of your world</i>

450
00:32:04,798 --> 00:32:06,425
No.

451
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:10,429
No, it's too easy.

452
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:13,265
She's already in love
with the human world

453
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,851
and now she found
her soulmate.

454
00:32:15,851 --> 00:32:16,935
Ugh.

455
00:32:17,478 --> 00:32:20,105
Oh, wait until
Daddy finds out.

456
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,941
He's gonna hit the surface.

457
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,861
That little girl's
gonna run straight

458
00:32:25,861 --> 00:32:28,405
into my tentacles.

459
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:32,117
Then I'll use her as a prawn
in my little game

460
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:36,246
and finally get to rip
the power away from Triton

461
00:32:36,246 --> 00:32:39,291
that should've been mine
all along.

462
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,422
All right.

463
00:32:45,422 --> 00:32:46,840
Okay.

464
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,967
As long as the King
never finds out,

465
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:51,220
everything will be all right.

466
00:32:51,387 --> 00:32:52,846
He never has to know she used

467
00:32:52,846 --> 00:32:56,225
that precious siren song
of hers to save a human.

468
00:32:57,643 --> 00:33:00,354
I just have to find Ariel
and get her back home.

469
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:02,231
Now, uh,

470
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,816
she was around here somewhere.

471
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:06,318
Ah-ha. Ah, yeah,
this must be it.

472
00:33:06,944 --> 00:33:08,862
I just have to be firm
with her,

473
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,323
get her to see that this is
all just a passing fad

474
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,493
and in time, she'll forget
all about him.

475
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,537
Ariel!

476
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:18,205
Sebastian,
how did you find me?

477
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,957
What is all of this?

478
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:21,625
What are you doin'
with that...

479
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:23,210
that thing?

480
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,421
Isn't it beautiful?

481
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,006
Look at the longing
in his eyes.

482
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:29,341
What you know about longin'?

483
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:30,968
What is he doin' here?

484
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,594
It's from the shipwreck.

485
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,971
I found him at Merman's Reef.

486
00:33:33,971 --> 00:33:35,389
And I'll bet
there's so much more.

487
00:33:35,556 --> 00:33:37,141
No, no! Ariel!

488
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,642
Child, get back here.

489
00:33:39,184 --> 00:33:40,185
Ariel!

490
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:43,731
You have to let go
of this obsession with humans.

491
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:45,107
I'm not obsessed.

492
00:33:45,107 --> 00:33:46,942
I may be crusty,
but I'm not blind.

493
00:33:46,942 --> 00:33:49,611
I saw you the night
of the shipwreck.

494
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,780
- What?
- Your father wants you to stay

495
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:54,074
as far away from them
as possible!

496
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:56,368
- But why?
- You know why.

497
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:59,121
We don't have to be afraid
of them, I know that now.

498
00:33:59,288 --> 00:34:01,623
Sebastian, if you had
just seen it up there.

499
00:34:01,623 --> 00:34:03,292
The ship rode on the wind,

500
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,210
and they filled the sky
with fire.

501
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:07,296
Okay, okay. Listen to me.

502
00:34:07,463 --> 00:34:10,048
The human world is a mess.

503
00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:11,759
Life under the sea is better

504
00:34:11,759 --> 00:34:13,844
than anything
they got goin' on up there.

505
00:34:14,928 --> 00:34:17,473
<i>The seaweed
Is always greener</i>

506
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,600
<i>In somebody else's lake</i>

507
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:22,644
<i>You dream about going up there</i>

508
00:34:22,811 --> 00:34:25,063
<i>But that is a big mistake</i>

509
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,649
<i>Just look at the world
Around you</i>

510
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:30,027
<i>Right here on the ocean floor</i>

511
00:34:30,194 --> 00:34:32,613
<i>Such wonderful things
Surround you</i>

512
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:34,656
<i>What more is you lookin' for?</i>

513
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:36,909
<i>Under the sea</i>

514
00:34:37,951 --> 00:34:39,536
<i>Under the sea</i>

515
00:34:40,454 --> 00:34:42,790
<i>Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter</i>

516
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,374
<i>Take it from me</i>

517
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,795
<i>Up on the shore
They work all day</i>

518
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,047
<i>Out in the sun they slave away</i>

519
00:34:50,297 --> 00:34:52,883
<i>While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'</i>

520
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,468
<i>Under the sea</i>

521
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,433
<i>Down here
All the fish is happy</i>

522
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,811
<i>As off through the waves
They roll</i>

523
00:35:03,977 --> 00:35:06,188
<i>The fish on the land
Ain't happy</i>

524
00:35:06,355 --> 00:35:08,732
<i>They sad 'cause
They in they bowl</i>

525
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,401
<i>But fish in the bowl is lucky</i>

526
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,695
<i>They in for a worser fate</i>

527
00:35:13,862 --> 00:35:16,240
<i>One day when the boss
Get hungry</i>

528
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,242
<i>Guess who's gon' be
On the plate</i>

529
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:20,285
<i>Oh, no
Under the sea</i>

530
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,664
<i>Under the sea</i>

531
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,458
<i>Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us</i>

532
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:28,085
<i>In fricassee</i>

533
00:35:29,211 --> 00:35:31,672
<i>We what the land folks
Love to cook</i>

534
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:34,174
<i>Under the sea
We off the hook</i>

535
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:35,467
<i>- We got no troubles</i>

536
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,760
<i>Life is the bubbles</i>

537
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,304
<i>- Under the sea, hey
- Under the sea</i>

538
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,640
<i>- Under the sea, yes, child
- Under the sea</i>

539
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,016
<i>Since life is sweet here</i>

540
00:35:43,016 --> 00:35:45,185
<i>We got the beat here Naturally</i>

541
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,520
<i>Naturally</i>

542
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:49,064
<i>Even the sturgeon an' the ray</i>

543
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,650
<i>They get the urge
'N' start to play</i>

544
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:54,111
<i>We got the spirit
You got to hear it</i>

545
00:35:54,111 --> 00:35:56,029
<i>- Under the sea</i>

546
00:35:58,448 --> 00:35:59,700
- Watch this.

547
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,076
<i>The newt play the flute</i>

548
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,495
<i>The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass</i>

549
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:04,788
<i>And they soundin' sharp</i>

550
00:36:04,788 --> 00:36:05,873
<i>The bass play the brass</i>

551
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:07,291
<i>The chub play the tub</i>

552
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:09,293
<i>The fluke is the duke of soul</i>

553
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,128
<i>Yeah! The ray he can play</i>

554
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:13,338
<i>The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out</i>

555
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,631
<i>The blackfish she sings</i>

556
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,467
<i>The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at</i>

557
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:20,053
<i>And oh, that blowfish blow!</i>

558
00:37:24,159 --> 00:37:26,870
<i>- Yeah! Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

559
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:29,373
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

560
00:37:29,373 --> 00:37:31,625
<i>When the sardine
Begin the beguine</i>

561
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:34,378
<i>- It's music to me
- Music is to me</i>

562
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,462
<i>What do they got?</i>

563
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,755
<i>- A lot of sand
- A lot of sand</i>

564
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,591
<i>We got a hot crustacean band
Yeah!</i>

565
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:42,010
<i>Each little clam here
Know how to jam here</i>

566
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,262
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

567
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,890
<i>Each little slug here
Cutting a rug here</i>

568
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:49,226
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

569
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:51,937
<i>Each little snail here
Know how to wail here</i>

570
00:37:52,104 --> 00:37:54,481
<i>That's why it's hotter
Under the water</i>

571
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,858
<i>Yeah, we in luck here
Down in the muck here</i>

572
00:37:57,025 --> 00:38:02,322
<i>- Under the sea
- Sea</i>

573
00:38:02,322 --> 00:38:03,782
<i>- Yes</i>

574
00:38:05,826 --> 00:38:07,494
Hey, Ariel?

575
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,000
Somebody got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

576
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:31,560
Oh, don't tell me
Eric is still going on

577
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,437
about this girl
who rescued him.

578
00:38:33,603 --> 00:38:34,813
I'm afraid so.

579
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:36,898
And the shipwreck.
Any casualties?

580
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,734
None, Your Majesty.

581
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,318
Well, thank goodness
no lives were lost.

582
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:41,570
Indeed.

583
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:45,615
This restless nature of his,
it concerns me.

584
00:38:45,782 --> 00:38:47,576
Undertaking these
dangerous voyages.

585
00:38:47,576 --> 00:38:49,369
- Oh, Eric, sit.

586
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,246
Any sign of that girl yet,
Grimsby?

587
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,123
Have some breakfast, please.

588
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:54,499
Uh, we looked, sire.

589
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,959
There was no girl.

590
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:57,919
You were lucky
to have made it to shore

591
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,087
before you passed out.

592
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:00,547
She was real.
She saved my life.

593
00:39:00,547 --> 00:39:01,673
Sit down, Eric.

594
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,467
- I'm not hungry, Mother.
- I'm worried about you.

595
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:05,177
You've not been yourself
since the shipwreck.

596
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,428
Have you checked
the neighboring islands?

597
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:07,804
- Not all of them, but...
- Then I will.

598
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,139
No, you will not.

599
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,851
You're not leaving this castle
until you're feeling better.

600
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,436
I'll feel better
when I find her.

601
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:16,188
Do not think
you're using

602
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,148
this girl as an excuse
to run off again,

603
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,941
risking your life
on some trade ship

604
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:21,151
for the sheer adventure.

605
00:39:21,151 --> 00:39:22,486
"Sheer adventure"?

606
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,654
I'm trying to reach out
to other cultures,

607
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,906
so we don't get left behind.

608
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:28,283
Did you know on this last trip

609
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:30,702
we traded our cane
for 20 cases of quinine?

610
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,329
They use it in Europe
to treat malaria.

611
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,539
And where are
those 20 cases now?

612
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,291
At the bottom of the sea.

613
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,501
How many shipwrecks
have there been

614
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:38,960
in our waters this year,
Prime Minister?

615
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,379
- Uh, six, Your Majesty.
- Did you hear that, Eric?

616
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,132
- Of course, I did.
- Shipwrecks, hurricanes,

617
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,718
the sea gods are against us.

618
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,386
How many times do I have to...

619
00:39:52,599 --> 00:39:56,311
They are eroding our land
from under us,

620
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,188
stealing it back
into the ocean.

621
00:39:58,355 --> 00:39:59,731
They would kill us all
if they could.

622
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:00,857
That's ridiculous.

623
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,400
Is it?

624
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,277
May I remind you,
that a deadly shipwreck

625
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:05,862
first brought you to us.

626
00:40:06,029 --> 00:40:09,032
And now, I almost lost you
to one the other day.

627
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,368
We cannot keep
tempting fate like this.

628
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:12,619
It has got to stop.

629
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,371
Well, what does that mean?

630
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,164
It means that...

631
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:21,461
that your responsibilities
are here now.

632
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,672
So, no more voyages

633
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:26,258
and no more chasing
after girls who don't exist.

634
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:47,904
<i>All I ever wanted</i>

635
00:40:47,904 --> 00:40:50,031
<i>Was the open sea and sky</i>

636
00:40:50,198 --> 00:40:53,743
<i>Freedom from the life
I always knew</i>

637
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:58,331
<i>Now, all I am is haunted
As days and hours roll by</i>

638
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,334
<i>All I ever think about is you</i>

639
00:41:02,002 --> 00:41:04,004
<i>- There you are</i>

640
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,797
<i>Over me</i>

641
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,134
<i>Taking me with your song</i>

642
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:13,346
<i>To wild uncharted waters</i>

643
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,558
<i>Miles beyond the sea</i>

644
00:41:17,267 --> 00:41:19,102
<i>I was darkness bound</i>

645
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,146
<i>I had almost drowned</i>

646
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:25,108
<i>Till you came around
And you found me</i>

647
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:29,196
<i>Now I am on the shoreline</i>

648
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:33,074
<i>But I'm still lost at sea</i>

649
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:37,704
<i>In these wild uncharted waters
Come find me</i>

650
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,581
<i>Again</i>

651
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,671
<i>All I do is wonder</i>

652
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,882
<i>Who you are
And where you'll be</i>

653
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:52,886
<i>In my mind
Your melody goes on</i>

654
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:57,182
<i>Stronger than the undertow
The night you rescued me</i>

655
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,227
<i>Silhouetted by the rising dawn</i>

656
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,979
<i>- Oh, oh-oh</i>

657
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,814
<i>Over you</i>

658
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:08,360
<i>I cannot get over you</i>

659
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:12,489
<i>In wild uncharted waters</i>

660
00:42:12,656 --> 00:42:15,742
<i>Beyond where man can see</i>

661
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:19,829
<i>When your eyes outshine
The horizon line</i>

662
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:24,042
<i>And you're finally real
Here beside me</i>

663
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:27,921
<i>Now I'm right here
On the shoreline</i>

664
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:31,716
<i>I'm right where you left me</i>

665
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:33,677
<i>And your voice is like</i>

666
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:36,096
<i>A siren that guides me</i>

667
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:39,808
<i>To wild uncharted waters</i>

668
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:43,353
<i>Alone, just you and me</i>

669
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:47,274
<i>And I hope you're there
In the open air</i>

670
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:52,237
<i>There's no map or compass
To guide me, no</i>

671
00:42:52,404 --> 00:42:55,323
<i>Time may change the shoreline</i>

672
00:42:55,490 --> 00:43:00,495
<i>But time will not change me</i>

673
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,415
<i>If it takes my life</i>

674
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,752
<i>I will finally find you again</i>

675
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:12,299
<i>In uncharted waters</i>

676
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:13,800
<i>Come find me</i>

677
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:21,933
<i>Again</i>

678
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:41,119
Ariel, could you
give me a hand?

679
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:46,333
Ariel!

680
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:48,918
Oh. Yes, of course.

681
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:51,046
How do
we untangle this?

682
00:43:51,212 --> 00:43:53,006
Do these humans have any idea

683
00:43:53,006 --> 00:43:55,050
how much damage
their shipwrecks do?

684
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,093
I don't think they intended
to have a shipwreck.

685
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,970
They are careless, Ariel.

686
00:43:59,137 --> 00:44:00,638
It will take
thousands of years

687
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,931
for this coral to grow back.

688
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:04,267
And they've killed
nearly all of the sea fern.

689
00:44:04,434 --> 00:44:06,436
They'd kill us too,
if they had the chance.

690
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,730
No, no.
They're not all like that.

691
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,732
Oh? How would you know?

692
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,567
You've never even seen one.

693
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:14,402
You were just a child
when Mother died,

694
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,113
and Father stopped us going
to the surface.

695
00:44:17,947 --> 00:44:19,991
I just mean,
we're not all the same,

696
00:44:19,991 --> 00:44:21,159
so why should humans be?

697
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,952
What about humans?

698
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:24,829
I... I just meant...

699
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:26,498
Look at what
their shipwreck did.

700
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,584
They got what they deserved.

701
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,630
They are the most
dangerous species of all.

702
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:35,340
Spoiling our waters,

703
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,717
destroying the reefs,

704
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:41,137
having no respect
for the balance of the oceans.

705
00:44:43,223 --> 00:44:44,265
They're not the only ones

706
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:46,059
who have no respect
for balance.

707
00:44:49,104 --> 00:44:51,022
Ariel, where are you...

708
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,691
What's going on with her?

709
00:44:53,858 --> 00:44:55,193
Oh, she's just at that age

710
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,403
when she doesn't want
to hang out

711
00:44:56,403 --> 00:44:57,862
with her older sisters anymore.

712
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,365
Exactly. You remember
what I was like.

713
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,158
How could we forget?

714
00:45:02,158 --> 00:45:04,035
Well, I wonder
who the lucky merman is.

715
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,925
The crab, Your Majesty.

716
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:22,345
Come over here, Sebastian.

717
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,474
Breathe, Sebastian.

718
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,144
Remember,
guilty is as guilty acts.

719
00:45:29,310 --> 00:45:32,147
Don't overreact, remain calm.

720
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,989
Yes, Your Majesty?

721
00:45:41,156 --> 00:45:42,866
Sebastian,

722
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:43,950
have you noticed

723
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,744
that Ariel has been
acting peculiar lately?

724
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,122
Peculiar, sir?

725
00:45:49,122 --> 00:45:51,875
Mm-hmm.
Distracted, daydreaming,

726
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,668
disappearing for hours.

727
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:56,421
You haven't noticed?

728
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:59,215
Oh... Well, I, um...

729
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:02,302
- Uh...

730
00:46:02,302 --> 00:46:05,305
Uh, I actually haven't,
you know, um...

731
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:07,182
that is to say,
I didn't, um...

732
00:46:09,976 --> 00:46:11,811
- Sebastian...
- Eh?

733
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,063
I know you've been keeping
something from me.

734
00:46:14,731 --> 00:46:16,774
- Keepin' somethin'?
- Mm-hmm.

735
00:46:17,692 --> 00:46:18,985
About Ariel.

736
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:20,653
Ariel?

737
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,372
Is my little one in love?

738
00:46:33,708 --> 00:46:35,335
Oh, I tried to stop her, sir!

739
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:36,920
I tried to stop her
from going to the surface!

740
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,505
I told her to stay away
from humans!

741
00:46:38,505 --> 00:46:39,589
- Humans?
- When I saw her

742
00:46:39,589 --> 00:46:40,798
with that statue, I...
Humans?

743
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,509
Who said anything
about humans?

744
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,389
Let's just drop
these things off and go back.

745
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,474
No way!

746
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,142
With all that great
stuff still down there?

747
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,352
Don't we have
enough already?

748
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:53,895
Come on, Flounder.

749
00:46:53,895 --> 00:46:55,021
We're just getting started.

750
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,439
So...

751
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:00,068
You broke the rules?

752
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,280
You went to the above world.

753
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,326
There was a shipwreck.

754
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,121
A man was drowning.
I had to save him.

755
00:47:12,288 --> 00:47:14,624
You should have let him drown.

756
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,251
They're savages.

757
00:47:16,417 --> 00:47:17,669
You don't know that.

758
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:21,464
They killed your mother.

759
00:47:22,382 --> 00:47:23,383
I know.

760
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:25,677
But...

761
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,262
one man did.

762
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,472
Why blame every human?

763
00:47:29,639 --> 00:47:30,848
- Mother wouldn't.
- No!

764
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:32,934
Enough. That's enough.

765
00:47:33,101 --> 00:47:35,186
And Eric had nothing
to do with it.

766
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,646
Eric?

767
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,648
Eric?

768
00:47:38,815 --> 00:47:40,817
Have you lost
your senses completely?

769
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,027
If you would have
just heard him, Father.

770
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,822
He's compassionate
and kind and...

771
00:47:45,989 --> 00:47:47,198
He's a human!

772
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:48,658
- You're a mermaid!
- Yes.

773
00:47:48,825 --> 00:47:50,326
But that doesn't
make us enemies.

774
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:52,412
Promise me you will never look
for him again.

775
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,248
- I can't.
- Promise me, Ariel!

776
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:57,292
I can't lie to you. I won't.

777
00:47:57,292 --> 00:47:59,294
I swear,
I will get through to you!

778
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,504
No!

779
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:02,839
Please!

780
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,841
Father, stop.

781
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:06,926
This ends now!

782
00:48:08,761 --> 00:48:10,346
Please, stop it!

783
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:12,140
It's for your own good.

784
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,144
Father, no!

785
00:48:44,339 --> 00:48:46,674
Never leave again.

786
00:49:09,364 --> 00:49:10,365
Ariel.

787
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,450
I'm...

788
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:13,951
Just go away.

789
00:49:32,136 --> 00:49:34,097
Poor child.

790
00:49:34,263 --> 00:49:36,307
Poor sweet child.

791
00:49:37,058 --> 00:49:39,519
He can be so angry.

792
00:49:40,353 --> 00:49:42,522
He thinks he knows everything.

793
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,566
Who are you?

794
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,569
Oh.
You must not remember me.

795
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:51,072
I'm your Auntie Ursula.

796
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:53,199
The Sea Witch?

797
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,201
The what?

798
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:58,746
What has your father
told you about me?

799
00:49:59,497 --> 00:50:00,540
That...

800
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,500
That you like
to stir up trouble

801
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,711
between humans and merpeople.

802
00:50:04,711 --> 00:50:07,130
Oh.
Is that what he said?

803
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:11,008
I'm not half the monster
he claims I am.

804
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:13,302
And I'm only here to help.

805
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:16,013
I don't need your help.

806
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,558
Whatever you say, darling.

807
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,648
- Wait.
- Yes?

808
00:50:29,235 --> 00:50:30,945
How can you help me?

809
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,372
Ariel?

810
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,291
Where is she going

811
00:50:43,291 --> 00:50:45,585
with those slippery
good-for-nothin's?

812
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:46,878
Let's go.

813
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:12,880
Come in.

814
00:52:13,047 --> 00:52:14,966
Come in, child.

815
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,927
We mustn't lurk
in passageways.

816
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:19,637
It's rude.

817
00:52:20,721 --> 00:52:23,307
Forgive my aggressive garden.

818
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:28,312
I wouldn't choose
to live like this, believe me.

819
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:30,940
Daddy's been so unfair
to both of us,

820
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:34,610
controlling everything
we say and do.

821
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:39,198
In a way, we're the same,
you and I.

822
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:43,536
You don't seem at all
like Father described you.

823
00:52:43,703 --> 00:52:44,954
Is that right?

824
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,082
Mmm. We never did get along.

825
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,501
Squidling rivalry.

826
00:52:50,668 --> 00:52:53,337
He always got what he wanted,
and what did I get? Nothin'.

827
00:52:53,796 --> 00:52:56,048
Zip, nada, squat.

828
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,427
Sound familiar, hon?

829
00:52:59,886 --> 00:53:02,638
Oh, I know what you're
going through, believe me,

830
00:53:02,805 --> 00:53:05,558
and I know why you're here.

831
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:07,685
I'm not sure I do.

832
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,979
- Oh, please.

833
00:53:09,979 --> 00:53:13,816
I've been watching you
for a long time now, dearie.

834
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:16,277
What you really want
is to be up there

835
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:18,154
in the above world.

836
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:21,115
It's always
had your curiosity,

837
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:24,243
and now it's got your heart.

838
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,745
What do you mean?

839
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,831
You're so young.

840
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:31,876
Don't you see?

841
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:33,836
You're meant for each other.

842
00:53:35,379 --> 00:53:39,050
And I can't bear to see you
suffer like this.

843
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,178
As it happens, I can help you.

844
00:53:43,054 --> 00:53:44,055
How?

845
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:47,725
Mmm, the problem is simple.

846
00:53:48,726 --> 00:53:51,479
You can't live in that world, unless...

847
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,399
you become a human yourself.

848
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,485
Become human?

849
00:53:58,694 --> 00:53:59,904
Is that even possible?

850
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:03,491
Oh, my dear.

851
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:05,117
It's what I do.

852
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,287
It's what I live for.

853
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:13,167
<i>I admit that
In the past I've been a nasty</i>

854
00:54:13,334 --> 00:54:15,044
<i>They weren't kidding
When they called me</i>

855
00:54:15,044 --> 00:54:16,837
<i>Well, a witch</i>

856
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:18,881
<i>But you'll find that nowadays</i>

857
00:54:19,048 --> 00:54:20,883
<i>I've mended all my ways</i>

858
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:24,345
<i>Repented, seen the light
And made a switch</i>

859
00:54:24,512 --> 00:54:27,306
<i>True? Yes</i>

860
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:31,894
<i>And I fortunately know
A little magic</i>

861
00:54:32,561 --> 00:54:36,023
<i>It's a talent that I always
Have possessed</i>

862
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,234
<i>And here lately
Please don't laugh</i>

863
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:40,236
<i>I use it on behalf</i>

864
00:54:40,403 --> 00:54:44,115
<i>Of the miserable, lonely
And depressed</i>

865
00:54:44,281 --> 00:54:46,117
<i>Pathetic</i>

866
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:49,412
<i>Poor unfortunate souls</i>

867
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:53,124
<i>In pain, in need</i>

868
00:54:53,124 --> 00:54:54,792
<i>This one longing to be thinner</i>

869
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,502
<i>That one wants to get the girl</i>

870
00:54:56,669 --> 00:54:58,504
<i>And do I help them?</i>

871
00:54:58,671 --> 00:55:00,423
<i>Yes, indeed</i>

872
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,801
<i>Those poor unfortunate souls</i>

873
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:07,638
<i>So sad, so true</i>

874
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,432
<i>They come flocking
To my cauldron</i>

875
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:11,350
<i>Crying "Spells, Ursula, please!"</i>

876
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,476
<i>And I help them?</i>

877
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,478
<i>Yes, I do</i>

878
00:55:15,479 --> 00:55:18,441
<i>Now, it's happened
Once or twice</i>

879
00:55:18,607 --> 00:55:20,860
<i>Someone couldn't pay the price</i>

880
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:25,364
<i>And I'm afraid I had
To rake 'em 'cross the coals</i>

881
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:28,951
<i>Yes, I've had
The odd complaint</i>

882
00:55:29,118 --> 00:55:34,498
<i>But on the whole
I've been a saint</i>

883
00:55:35,041 --> 00:55:42,006
<i>To those poor
Unfortunate souls</i>

884
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:44,258
- The Sea Witch!
- Shh.

885
00:55:45,468 --> 00:55:46,969
So, here's the deal.

886
00:55:47,136 --> 00:55:48,387
I'll whip up a little potion

887
00:55:48,387 --> 00:55:50,514
to make you human
for three days.

888
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:51,682
Got that?

889
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:52,850
Three days.

890
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:56,187
Before the sun sets
on the third day,

891
00:55:56,187 --> 00:55:58,314
you and Princey
must share a kiss.

892
00:55:58,481 --> 00:56:00,691
And not just any kiss.

893
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:02,943
The kiss of true love.

894
00:56:04,612 --> 00:56:09,033
If you do, you will remain
human permanently.

895
00:56:09,658 --> 00:56:11,243
But if you don't,

896
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:15,206
you'll turn back
into a mermaid,

897
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:18,292
and you belong to me.

898
00:56:18,459 --> 00:56:19,877
- No, Ariel!
- Shh.

899
00:56:20,961 --> 00:56:22,588
You understand,
of course,

900
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:26,258
that you'll have to give up
your mermaid gifts.

901
00:56:26,425 --> 00:56:28,052
You won't have
this tail of yours,

902
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:30,304
hangin' around,
draggin' you down.

903
00:56:31,055 --> 00:56:33,933
You won't be able to breathe
underwater, who needs it?

904
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:39,188
And you'll no longer have
that siren song of yours,

905
00:56:39,355 --> 00:56:42,608
because that wouldn't be fair,
now would it?

906
00:56:43,275 --> 00:56:44,610
Don't worry.

907
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:48,739
I'll keep it safe
and soundless here with me.

908
00:56:50,366 --> 00:56:51,700
We got a deal?

909
00:56:54,745 --> 00:56:56,080
I don't know.

910
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,998
Well...

911
00:56:58,165 --> 00:57:00,668
I mean, I just gave you
the premium package, kid.

912
00:57:00,668 --> 00:57:01,752
Well...

913
00:57:04,088 --> 00:57:07,508
life's full of tough choices,
idn't?

914
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,263
No.

915
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,056
This is wrong.
I can't do this.

916
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:18,477
Fine then,
forget about the world above.

917
00:57:18,644 --> 00:57:21,147
Go back home to Daddy

918
00:57:21,313 --> 00:57:23,899
- and "Never leave again!"

919
00:57:23,899 --> 00:57:27,945
<i>Come on
You poor unfortunate soul!</i>

920
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:29,280
<i>Go ahead</i>

921
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,157
<i>Make your choice</i>

922
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:32,950
<i>I'm a very busy woman</i>

923
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:34,535
<i>And I haven't got all day</i>

924
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:37,538
<i>It won't cost much
Just your voice</i>

925
00:57:38,581 --> 00:57:41,542
<i>You poor unfortunate soul</i>

926
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:44,962
<i>It's sad, but true</i>

927
00:57:45,129 --> 00:57:46,839
<i>If you want to cross
The bridge, my sweet</i>

928
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:48,215
<i>You've got to pay the toll</i>

929
00:57:48,382 --> 00:57:49,925
<i>Pluck a scale
From off your tail</i>

930
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:51,635
<i>A drop of blood
Inside the bowl!</i>

931
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,679
<i>Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys</i>

932
00:57:53,846 --> 00:57:57,349
<i>For boss is on a roll!</i>

933
00:57:58,809 --> 00:58:02,438
<i>This poor unfortunate...</i>

934
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:09,153
<i>Soul!</i>

935
00:58:11,572 --> 00:58:16,869
<i>Beluga! Sevruga!
Come winds of the Caspian Sea!</i>

936
00:58:18,746 --> 00:58:22,291
<i>Amnesia, glossitis
Et max laryngitis</i>

937
00:58:22,458 --> 00:58:25,586
<i>La voce to me!</i>

938
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:28,714
Now sing!

939
00:58:37,473 --> 00:58:39,266
Keep singing!

940
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,239
Whoa!

941
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,037
Yes!

942
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,831
Yes!

943
00:59:07,002 --> 00:59:09,797
Look at her stupid
little feet!

944
00:59:30,985 --> 00:59:32,278
Oh, Ariel.

945
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:36,115
Well, come on, gal.

946
00:59:36,282 --> 00:59:37,825
It's either sink or swim.

947
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:50,170
Don't worry, boys.

948
00:59:50,879 --> 00:59:54,633
She doesn't stand a chance
without this.

949
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:57,261
A mermaid without her voice?

950
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:01,265
And just in case,

951
01:00:01,432 --> 01:00:05,311
I slipped a little somethin'
extra into that spell of mine.

952
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:08,981
No matter how hard
that girl tries,

953
01:00:09,148 --> 01:00:13,235
she won't remember
she needs to get that kiss.

954
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:15,654
Now it's just a matter
of time.

955
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:18,991
And then she's mine.

956
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:21,535
- Hmm.

957
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:29,251
Not so easy
without your tail, is it?

958
01:00:30,836 --> 01:00:31,837
Keep going.

959
01:00:32,004 --> 01:00:33,589
You just got
to get your sea legs.

960
01:00:34,715 --> 01:00:36,592
- We're almost there.

961
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,352
Get away from here!

962
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:49,563
Lord have mercy.

963
01:00:52,149 --> 01:00:53,233
Are you all right?

964
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:57,905
Ah, poor girl.

965
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,323
You must be in shock.

966
01:01:00,741 --> 01:01:02,451
I'll go find something
to cover you up.

967
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,912
Another shipwreck.

968
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,247
<i>Santa Maria.</i>

969
01:01:27,518 --> 01:01:29,144
Say, what's goin' on, kid?

970
01:01:29,353 --> 01:01:30,729
I thought you weren't supposed
to be up here,

971
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:31,814
now you're taking boat rides?

972
01:01:31,814 --> 01:01:33,607
That... That...
That rotten Sea Witch,

973
01:01:33,607 --> 01:01:34,775
she stole Ariel's voice.

974
01:01:34,775 --> 01:01:36,193
Hey, Flounder.

975
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:37,569
What... What are you
talkin' about?

976
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,863
So, Sebastian told Triton
that Ariel saved a human

977
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:41,281
- and Triton got so mad.
- Okay, okay, okay.

978
01:01:41,281 --> 01:01:42,950
- And then... Wait!
- Explanations later, man.

979
01:01:42,950 --> 01:01:44,034
We've gotta get you
out of here.

980
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,786
Wait! I didn't tell you
about the Sea Witch!

981
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:48,872
Bye-bye. And don't tell anyone
about the Sea Witch!

982
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:53,043
Something about you
seems different.

983
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,336
Don't tell me.

984
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:56,463
It's your hairdo, right?

985
01:01:56,630 --> 01:01:58,048
'Cause you've been using
the dinglehopper? No?

986
01:01:58,924 --> 01:02:01,969
I can't... I can't
quite figure it out,

987
01:02:02,803 --> 01:02:05,013
but I know that if I stand
here for long enough...

988
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,516
She got legs, ya idiot!

989
01:02:07,683 --> 01:02:09,226
You know,
we've discussed this.

990
01:02:09,226 --> 01:02:10,936
I don't like it
when you call me an idiot.

991
01:02:11,103 --> 01:02:12,271
Why don't you tell me
somethin' nice?

992
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:13,355
"Hey, Scuttle.

993
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:14,606
-"Your feathers look good."
Shoo!

994
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,733
- Here you are.

995
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:18,902
It'll have to do for now.

996
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,737
I'll take you to the castle.

997
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,448
They'll know what
to do with you there.

998
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:24,867
Come on, in ya go.

999
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:34,334
Good catch today.
It looks good, though.

1000
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:36,003
It looks raw.

1001
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,839
You're not done yet?

1002
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,757
His looks so good!

1003
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:42,342
I must say a parrie fish.

1004
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:44,219
Got plenty of fish
for two weeks.

1005
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:47,556
Hey!

1006
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:49,516
<i>Look at the sun and the sky</i>

1007
01:02:49,516 --> 01:02:52,853
<i>And the sand and the sea
Behind me</i>

1008
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:56,315
<i>Look at me, suddenly I am
On land and I'm free</i>

1009
01:02:56,482 --> 01:03:01,111
<i>Don't mind me as I climb
For the first time</i>

1010
01:03:01,111 --> 01:03:03,655
<i>Jump for the first time</i>

1011
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:04,823
<i>Trying to stand</i>

1012
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:06,658
<i>But this gravity's
Pulling me down</i>

1013
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:13,624
Walk on, Emile.

1014
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:15,876
Trot on!

1015
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:19,922
Trot on!

1016
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,215
Get Lashana, quick!

1017
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,508
Right-o!

1018
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:26,887
What is all this?

1019
01:03:27,054 --> 01:03:28,430
What on Earth?

1020
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,390
The girl got tangled
in the net.

1021
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,685
- She all right?
- She'll survive.

1022
01:03:33,852 --> 01:03:35,145
But she's been
through it, though.

1023
01:03:35,145 --> 01:03:36,313
Won't say a word.

1024
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,315
I wonder what happened
to her out there.

1025
01:03:38,315 --> 01:03:39,483
<i>Look, it's a fire</i>

1026
01:03:39,483 --> 01:03:40,776
<i>It's warm and it glows</i>

1027
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:43,612
<i>And it lights this chamber</i>

1028
01:03:43,779 --> 01:03:45,489
<i>Let me admire it
Ow!</i>

1029
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,074
<i>Get too close and it bites</i>

1030
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:51,703
<i>I came too close
For the first time</i>

1031
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,373
<i>Burned for the first time</i>

1032
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:57,042
<i>Everything's clearer
And brighter and hotter</i>

1033
01:03:57,209 --> 01:03:59,628
<i>But now that I'm here
Like a fish out of water</i>

1034
01:03:59,628 --> 01:04:00,796
<i>I'm trying to stand</i>

1035
01:04:00,796 --> 01:04:03,298
<i>But this gravity's
Pulling me down</i>

1036
01:04:03,298 --> 01:04:05,592
Oh, my! Heavens.

1037
01:04:05,759 --> 01:04:07,761
Here, let me
take you upstairs,

1038
01:04:07,928 --> 01:04:10,514
get you cleaned up,
find you some clothes.

1039
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:14,184
Okay, up we go,

1040
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:17,854
one step at a time.

1041
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,817
She can't speak at all?

1042
01:04:21,984 --> 01:04:23,819
Can you blame her, Rosa?

1043
01:04:23,986 --> 01:04:25,779
After all she's been through,

1044
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:27,990
it's a blessing
she's not worse off.

1045
01:04:28,156 --> 01:04:30,033
Such a faraway look
in her eye.

1046
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:33,161
Bit of a soap and a scrub,
she'll be good as new.

1047
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:36,999
<i>Are we only</i>

1048
01:04:36,999 --> 01:04:40,043
<i>Food for slaughter?</i>

1049
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:43,046
<i>Is this life on land?</i>

1050
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,090
Child, the blue dress
that's in your room.

1051
01:04:45,257 --> 01:04:50,387
<i>Well, you were lonely
Under water</i>

1052
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:53,390
<i>Come on, Ariel, time to stand</i>

1053
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:58,228
There you go.
Smells nice, doesn't it?

1054
01:04:58,395 --> 01:04:59,563
Oh, no, you poor girl.

1055
01:04:59,730 --> 01:05:01,231
You must be starvin'.

1056
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:03,066
Rosa, get this poor child
some food.

1057
01:05:03,233 --> 01:05:05,569
And quick, before she tries
to eat the scrub brush.

1058
01:05:05,736 --> 01:05:07,446
- Yes, ma'am.
- Right.

1059
01:05:07,613 --> 01:05:10,699
Let's get that seaweed stink
off you, girl.

1060
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,326
Yes.

1061
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,336
<i>Squeeze in the shoes</i>

1062
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:23,545
<i>And the corset, it's tight</i>

1063
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:26,715
<i>- And the seams are busting</i>

1064
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:28,800
<i>Some women choose this
I guess it's all right</i>

1065
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:31,136
<i>Are my dreams adjusting</i>

1066
01:05:31,136 --> 01:05:32,304
Hard to believe,

1067
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:34,765
two shipwrecks in one week.

1068
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:37,726
Prince Eric's still looking
for that girl who saved him.

1069
01:05:37,893 --> 01:05:39,603
Said he won't rest
until he finds her.

1070
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:44,816
Stay right there.
I'll get the Prince.

1071
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:49,196
<i>As I wait for the first time</i>

1072
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,740
<i>Here for the first time</i>

1073
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:54,534
<i>Now, for the first time</i>

1074
01:05:54,701 --> 01:06:01,541
<i>He's coming
Through those doors</i>

1075
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:07,255
<i>Up the stairs</i>

1076
01:06:07,255 --> 01:06:12,469
<i>From the shore</i>

1077
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:17,808
<i>From that moment</i>

1078
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,352
<i>And he'll smile</i>

1079
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:23,146
<i>Like he knows</i>

1080
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:25,565
<i>When I say</i>

1081
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,155
I'm so sorry to hear
what happened.

1082
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:33,907
What's your name?

1083
01:06:34,241 --> 01:06:35,742
She doesn't speak, sire.

1084
01:06:38,203 --> 01:06:39,204
She...

1085
01:06:40,288 --> 01:06:41,289
Oh.

1086
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,586
Well, we're glad
you've made it to us.

1087
01:06:48,171 --> 01:06:49,715
Do you have a place to stay?

1088
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:50,882
Family?

1089
01:06:52,759 --> 01:06:54,720
Well, then you're welcome
to stay here.

1090
01:06:55,387 --> 01:06:56,596
For as long as you like.

1091
01:06:58,056 --> 01:06:59,474
Make sure she has anything
she needs.

1092
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:00,726
Yes, Your Highness.

1093
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:14,072
We should let you
get some rest.

1094
01:07:23,415 --> 01:07:26,084
<i>Realize
The price that you paid</i>

1095
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,502
<i>With your voice</i>

1096
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:30,881
<i>As he turns from you</i>

1097
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:35,093
<i>Those sacrifices you made</i>

1098
01:07:35,093 --> 01:07:39,264
<i>Were a choice
That you can't undo</i>

1099
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,017
<i>Lost</i>

1100
01:07:42,184 --> 01:07:44,519
<i>For the first time</i>

1101
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,313
<i>Scared</i>

1102
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,690
<i>For the first time</i>

1103
01:07:49,816 --> 01:07:54,446
<i>Gravity feels like an undertow</i>

1104
01:07:54,446 --> 01:07:56,865
<i>Pulling me</i>

1105
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,036
<i>Down</i>

1106
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:11,213
This has got to be,
without a doubt,

1107
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,800
the single most humiliating
day of my life!

1108
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,302
I could have been fricasseed,

1109
01:08:17,302 --> 01:08:21,264
and then, having to climb
all the way up here.

1110
01:08:21,431 --> 01:08:23,600
They couldn't give you a room
on the ground floor?

1111
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,020
I hope you appreciate

1112
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,731
what I go through
for you, young lady.

1113
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:30,857
Eh, no.

1114
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,609
Don't ya turn your back on me.

1115
01:08:32,776 --> 01:08:33,944
What were you thinkin',

1116
01:08:33,944 --> 01:08:37,030
choosin' to give up
your mermaid gifts?

1117
01:08:37,197 --> 01:08:39,908
Now, if we could just get
that witch to give them back,

1118
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:42,702
then you could go home
and just be...

1119
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,412
uh, well, and just be...

1120
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:49,835
just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

1121
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,922
Oh, my, what a soft shell
I am turnin' out to be.

1122
01:08:54,923 --> 01:08:57,259
All right. All right.

1123
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,052
I'll try to help you.

1124
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:01,179
But we've got to be bold,
act quickly.

1125
01:09:01,346 --> 01:09:03,014
Don't forget about the kiss.

1126
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,809
Ah, no, no, not me,
the Prince!

1127
01:09:05,809 --> 01:09:07,143
You gotta kiss the Prince.

1128
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:08,353
Don't you remember?

1129
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:09,980
You only have three days to...

1130
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:12,357
Hello?

1131
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,901
Oh, no!

1132
01:09:15,068 --> 01:09:17,070
- She's put a spell on you.

1133
01:09:17,070 --> 01:09:19,197
You can't remember, can you?

1134
01:09:19,197 --> 01:09:21,116
Now,
what are we gonna do?

1135
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:23,785
Well, we got no time to lose.

1136
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:25,537
We just got to find a way

1137
01:09:25,537 --> 01:09:27,372
to get the two
of you together.

1138
01:09:31,293 --> 01:09:33,837
You are hopeless, child.

1139
01:09:34,004 --> 01:09:35,005
You know that?

1140
01:09:36,548 --> 01:09:38,091
Completely hopeless.

1141
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:49,477
Ooh. A buffet.

1142
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,732
- What? No nuts?

1143
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,066
What are you doin' here?

1144
01:09:55,233 --> 01:09:57,652
Oh, there you are.
I've been lookin' for you.

1145
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,487
Flounder told me
the whole story.

1146
01:09:59,654 --> 01:10:01,281
Has Ariel killed
the Prince yet?

1147
01:10:01,281 --> 01:10:02,908
No, not "killed."

1148
01:10:03,074 --> 01:10:04,701
"Kissed," ya bird brain.

1149
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,202
And it's worse
than we thought.

1150
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,913
The witch has placed
a spell on her.

1151
01:10:07,913 --> 01:10:09,789
Soon as I tell her
she's got to kiss him,

1152
01:10:09,789 --> 01:10:12,208
the thought jumps clear
right out of her head.

1153
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:13,418
So, now it's up to us.

1154
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:14,794
To kiss the Prince?

1155
01:10:14,794 --> 01:10:16,254
Forget it.

1156
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,714
Where's Ariel now?

1157
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:19,299
What do ya mean?
She's right...

1158
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,011
Oh.

1159
01:12:24,674 --> 01:12:26,718
What are you doin'
in here, child?

1160
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:29,846
You can't just go wanderin'
around wherever you please.

1161
01:12:29,846 --> 01:12:31,765
- Hide!
Who's in here?

1162
01:12:40,482 --> 01:12:41,524
Oh, it's you.

1163
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:49,199
Nobody usually comes in here.

1164
01:12:53,078 --> 01:12:54,871
- My little mermaid.

1165
01:12:56,331 --> 01:12:58,249
It's all right,
it's all right.

1166
01:12:58,416 --> 01:12:59,834
You can look at it.

1167
01:13:00,001 --> 01:13:02,128
I found her on the coast
of Cartagena.

1168
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:04,506
Isn't she beautiful?

1169
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:09,177
Oh, that's right. You...

1170
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:13,515
Well, it really
doesn't matter.

1171
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,059
Most people around here
use too many words

1172
01:13:16,059 --> 01:13:17,227
and have nothing to say.

1173
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:19,938
You know,

1174
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,232
I never believed all that lore

1175
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:25,568
about mermaids luring
sailors to their deaths.

1176
01:13:28,029 --> 01:13:29,447
Here, take her.

1177
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:32,617
No, really.
I want you to have her.

1178
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:35,495
I'm running out of space
as it is.

1179
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,082
Nearly all of these things
come from my voyages.

1180
01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:42,585
I know it must seem silly,
collecting all this stuff,

1181
01:13:42,752 --> 01:13:45,797
but just look
at this fossilized sea stone.

1182
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:47,549
Can you believe
that such amazing things

1183
01:13:47,549 --> 01:13:48,633
exist down there?

1184
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:53,513
No, wait!

1185
01:14:01,813 --> 01:14:03,314
How did you know
that was in there...

1186
01:14:05,358 --> 01:14:06,359
all this time?

1187
01:14:08,862 --> 01:14:09,904
That's incredible.

1188
01:14:11,781 --> 01:14:13,032
- Well, that.
Hey, girl.

1189
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,743
That I just picked up from
the beach here on the island.

1190
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,913
There's loads of them
at this time of year.

1191
01:14:26,171 --> 01:14:27,964
I had no idea
you could do that.

1192
01:14:29,924 --> 01:14:31,092
Oh, me?

1193
01:14:31,843 --> 01:14:32,844
No... Oh.

1194
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:34,429
Really?

1195
01:14:34,596 --> 01:14:35,847
All right, hand...

1196
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,266
How do I...

1197
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:40,935
Yeah, that's it.

1198
01:14:40,935 --> 01:14:42,270
That's it, girl.

1199
01:14:42,270 --> 01:14:43,813
- Go get it, go get it.

1200
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:44,898
I see ya.

1201
01:14:44,898 --> 01:14:47,066
Go on, come now...

1202
01:14:50,737 --> 01:14:53,072
Sorry.

1203
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:54,616
Yeah, well...

1204
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:57,243
I'll work on that.

1205
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,038
I love the people there.

1206
01:15:00,038 --> 01:15:02,540
Their culture, their custom.

1207
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:05,752
This whole region is known
as the Brazilian Empire.

1208
01:15:05,919 --> 01:15:08,213
Then there's Venezuela,

1209
01:15:09,047 --> 01:15:11,174
uh, Colombia...

1210
01:15:11,966 --> 01:15:14,636
Oh, the area up here
is called Mosquito Coast.

1211
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:19,724
Those waters
are all uncharted.

1212
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:23,019
Wouldn't it be amazing
to discover someplace

1213
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,520
no one's ever seen before?

1214
01:15:29,025 --> 01:15:30,693
Ah. Well, this...

1215
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:32,987
this was one
of my favorite voyages.

1216
01:15:33,988 --> 01:15:35,531
I bought
that Peruvian rug there,

1217
01:15:35,698 --> 01:15:37,909
along with six of the looms
they used to make it.

1218
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:38,993
Oh.

1219
01:15:39,327 --> 01:15:40,912
Another one.
All right.

1220
01:15:42,413 --> 01:15:45,541
Ah. This is our island.

1221
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,002
We're in that very castle
right now.

1222
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:51,130
Over here's our main village.

1223
01:15:51,297 --> 01:15:54,133
Now, our port there was once
the busiest in the region.

1224
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:57,428
I'm hoping it will be again
one day.

1225
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:00,765
And there's a beautiful lagoon

1226
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:02,684
with a little waterfall
right here.

1227
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:05,395
And then all of that
is rainforest.

1228
01:16:06,688 --> 01:16:09,357
I could show you around,
if you like.

1229
01:16:10,817 --> 01:16:12,402
All right.

1230
01:16:12,568 --> 01:16:14,404
- We'll go tomorrow.
But, sire...

1231
01:16:14,404 --> 01:16:16,322
Oh, Grimsby, good.

1232
01:16:16,322 --> 01:16:17,573
We'll need a horse
and carriage

1233
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:18,658
ready for us in the morning.

1234
01:16:19,284 --> 01:16:21,536
May I have a quiet word, sire?

1235
01:16:23,413 --> 01:16:24,414
Of course.

1236
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,210
He's a special one, isn't he?

1237
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:30,878
And that moonlight. Ah...

1238
01:16:34,299 --> 01:16:37,010
We were going to send out
all the carriages tomorrow

1239
01:16:37,010 --> 01:16:38,219
to look for the girl.

1240
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,305
The girl! I wasn't thinking.

1241
01:16:40,471 --> 01:16:42,807
Of course, yes,
we must do that. Absolutely.

1242
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:44,684
And I must remind you, Eric,

1243
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:45,935
what your mother
said yesterday

1244
01:16:45,935 --> 01:16:47,603
about you not leaving
the castle

1245
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:50,148
- until you're feeling better.
- Grimsby, I feel fine.

1246
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,025
I feel better than ever.

1247
01:16:52,859 --> 01:16:53,860
Yes.

1248
01:16:55,153 --> 01:16:56,404
Yes, I can see that.

1249
01:16:58,156 --> 01:17:02,076
I suppose we could spare
one carriage.

1250
01:17:25,725 --> 01:17:27,769
Looks like
you made a friend there.

1251
01:17:28,102 --> 01:17:29,479
Come on, Max.

1252
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:30,897
We'll see you later.

1253
01:17:30,897 --> 01:17:32,857
Oh, no.
You're not goin' without me.

1254
01:17:33,024 --> 01:17:34,692
I only got two days left.

1255
01:17:34,692 --> 01:17:35,943
I'm a crab on a mission.

1256
01:17:35,943 --> 01:17:37,779
Trot on, King.

1257
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:44,744
- I'm getting too old for this.

1258
01:17:44,744 --> 01:17:46,621
Oh, no, no, no! Down, beast!

1259
01:17:48,247 --> 01:17:49,332
Whoa!

1260
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:53,252
I still got it.

1261
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:00,134
Who is that ridin' out
with Prince Eric?

1262
01:18:00,301 --> 01:18:02,095
Is that the girl who washed up
the other day?

1263
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:03,679
Yes, it is, Lashana.

1264
01:18:04,847 --> 01:18:07,100
Didn't the Queen tell him
to stay in the castle?

1265
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:08,601
Yes, she did, Lashana.

1266
01:18:08,768 --> 01:18:10,269
Aren't you going
to get into trouble

1267
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:11,729
for fetching him a carriage?

1268
01:18:11,896 --> 01:18:13,398
What carriage, Lashana?

1269
01:18:37,588 --> 01:18:38,589
Oh.

1270
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:40,007
Do you wanna try?

1271
01:18:41,634 --> 01:18:42,635
Here.

1272
01:18:43,928 --> 01:18:44,929
Oh!

1273
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:51,853
Um...

1274
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,983
Look out! Look out!

1275
01:18:57,817 --> 01:18:59,360
Come on! Move, move, move!

1276
01:19:03,114 --> 01:19:05,908
Sorry about that!

1277
01:19:08,119 --> 01:19:09,579
That was close.

1278
01:19:09,579 --> 01:19:10,663
Whoa!

1279
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,248
Hey, guys!
Get out the way!

1280
01:19:13,499 --> 01:19:14,709
- Turn!
Quickly!

1281
01:19:14,709 --> 01:19:15,793
Wait, wait, wait!

1282
01:19:16,961 --> 01:19:17,962
Careful!

1283
01:19:31,601 --> 01:19:32,894
Oh!

1284
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:34,645
That was...

1285
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,022
fun.

1286
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:37,315
Here, I'll...

1287
01:19:39,901 --> 01:19:40,902
Let me give you a hand.

1288
01:19:41,611 --> 01:19:42,653
Move, move 'em.

1289
01:19:42,653 --> 01:19:43,863
Here we go. This way.

1290
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,490
Come on. This way.

1291
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:48,326
Here we go.

1292
01:19:48,493 --> 01:19:49,535
Go on. That's it.

1293
01:19:50,828 --> 01:19:51,913
Thank you, lad.

1294
01:20:11,349 --> 01:20:12,600
Island berry?

1295
01:20:12,767 --> 01:20:14,352
How is it? Pretty?

1296
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,146
- Whoa!
Coconut!

1297
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,731
Breadfruit!
Coconut!

1298
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:21,984
Fresh coconut?

1299
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,321
No? You don't want it?

1300
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:27,156
Get some water in ya.

1301
01:20:29,325 --> 01:20:30,701
Thank you, Miss.
Young lady,

1302
01:20:30,701 --> 01:20:32,245
would you like to try some?

1303
01:20:35,039 --> 01:20:36,040
Oh!

1304
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:37,959
I think you'll be
needing this.

1305
01:20:53,683 --> 01:20:55,393
Hey,
can I have some salt?

1306
01:20:56,352 --> 01:20:57,895
Good day, sire.

1307
01:20:58,771 --> 01:21:00,439
How ripe the mango?

1308
01:21:00,606 --> 01:21:01,857
Hat for the lady?

1309
01:21:04,569 --> 01:21:06,153
Oh.  There you are.

1310
01:21:08,114 --> 01:21:10,783
- Oh.
- No, no. Too big.

1311
01:21:10,950 --> 01:21:11,951
Try this.

1312
01:21:18,457 --> 01:21:19,959
Tropical flowers?

1313
01:21:58,122 --> 01:22:00,124
Hey!
Everybody, everybody!

1314
01:22:00,124 --> 01:22:01,626
- Hey, hey, hey!

1315
01:22:01,626 --> 01:22:02,877
Hey!

1316
01:22:07,173 --> 01:22:09,258
Say, any kissing yet?

1317
01:22:09,425 --> 01:22:13,137
No. When it comes to romance,
these two are slow as snails.

1318
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:14,805
Hey, go find Flounder.

1319
01:22:14,805 --> 01:22:17,058
We got to move
this thing along, and quick.

1320
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:18,726
Okay, bossy.

1321
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,649
Hey!

1322
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:25,900
Hey!

1323
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,945
Bring it here, bring it here,
bring it here now!

1324
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,697
Back it up, back it up,
back it up!

1325
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:38,037
Come on, now!

1326
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,055
I love this time of night.

1327
01:22:57,556 --> 01:23:00,393
Sometimes you'll see the eyes
of a screech owl,

1328
01:23:00,393 --> 01:23:01,477
up in the tree...

1329
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,020
- Hey! Hey!

1330
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,438
Hey, come back with that!

1331
01:23:05,106 --> 01:23:06,107
Come on.

1332
01:23:07,692 --> 01:23:08,818
Watch out.

1333
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:10,861
I think it went this way.

1334
01:23:11,028 --> 01:23:13,072
You all right?  Hey!

1335
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,574
Give me my hat back!

1336
01:23:21,288 --> 01:23:24,041
Oh. All right then.

1337
01:23:27,253 --> 01:23:29,171
I didn't want to lose this.

1338
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:47,022
Move
your big fat feathers, bird.

1339
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:48,190
I can't see a thing.

1340
01:23:48,190 --> 01:23:49,525
Well, that worked pretty good,
didn't it?

1341
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,901
- But nothing's happening.

1342
01:23:50,901 --> 01:23:53,320
We're running out of time,
and no one's puckered up once.

1343
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:55,406
I think it's time for a little

1344
01:23:55,573 --> 01:23:57,992
vocal romantic stimulation.

1345
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,619
Please, no.

1346
01:24:00,619 --> 01:24:02,538
- Scuttle? You got to be...
-  <i>Me, me, me</i>

1347
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:03,914
<i>- Womp chicka womp womp</i>

1348
01:24:03,914 --> 01:24:05,207
<i>- Chicka womp womp</i>
Shh!

1349
01:24:05,207 --> 01:24:06,292
<i>Chicka womp</i>

1350
01:24:08,294 --> 01:24:09,670
<i>Womp womp</i>

1351
01:24:09,670 --> 01:24:10,838
- All right. Gosh.
<i>- Womp</i>

1352
01:24:10,838 --> 01:24:11,964
I was off.
I was off on that one.

1353
01:24:11,964 --> 01:24:13,048
- No.
<i>- Womp</i>

1354
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:14,133
Let me find it.
Let me find it.

1355
01:24:14,133 --> 01:24:16,010
<i>- Womp</i>
- Ya finish?

1356
01:24:16,177 --> 01:24:17,178
<i>Womp</i>

1357
01:24:17,178 --> 01:24:18,596
All right, all right. Listen.

1358
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:20,556
Ariel cannot know
we're helpin'.

1359
01:24:20,723 --> 01:24:22,892
If she sees or hears us,
she'll shut us down.

1360
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,519
Nah, man. We got
to be sneaky about this.

1361
01:24:25,686 --> 01:24:27,438
We got to work on the Prince

1362
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,440
using the power of suggestion.

1363
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,524
Good.

1364
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:32,985
How are we gonna do that?

1365
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,529
We got to blend in
with the sounds of nature,

1366
01:24:35,529 --> 01:24:36,989
so she doesn't hear us.

1367
01:24:38,032 --> 01:24:39,074
Percussion.

1368
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:47,082
Strings.

1369
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,546
Winds.

1370
01:24:57,718 --> 01:24:59,512
Words.

1371
01:24:59,678 --> 01:25:02,681
<i>There you see her</i>

1372
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,935
<i>Sitting there across the way</i>

1373
01:25:06,352 --> 01:25:08,437
<i>She don't got a lot to say</i>

1374
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,607
<i>But there's something
About her</i>

1375
01:25:13,359 --> 01:25:15,069
<i>And you don't know why</i>

1376
01:25:15,069 --> 01:25:16,779
<i>But you're dying to try</i>

1377
01:25:16,779 --> 01:25:19,323
<i>You wanna kiss the girl</i>

1378
01:25:23,369 --> 01:25:26,455
<i>Yes, you want her</i>

1379
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,874
<i>Look at her, you know you do</i>

1380
01:25:30,376 --> 01:25:32,253
<i>Possible she wants you, too</i>

1381
01:25:32,253 --> 01:25:35,214
<i>Use your words, boy
And ask her</i>

1382
01:25:35,214 --> 01:25:36,298
Do you want to try?

1383
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,676
<i>If the time is right</i>

1384
01:25:38,843 --> 01:25:40,636
<i>Then the time is tonight</i>

1385
01:25:40,803 --> 01:25:42,805
<i>- Go on and kiss the girl</i>

1386
01:25:49,395 --> 01:25:51,480
<i>Sha la la la la la, my oh, my</i>

1387
01:25:51,647 --> 01:25:53,482
<i>Look like the boy too shy</i>

1388
01:25:53,649 --> 01:25:55,901
<i>Ain't gonna kiss the girl</i>

1389
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:57,695
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

1390
01:25:57,695 --> 01:25:58,904
<i>Ain't that sad</i>

1391
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:00,698
<i>Ain't it a shame, too bad</i>

1392
01:26:00,698 --> 01:26:02,449
<i>- He's gonna miss the girl</i>

1393
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:03,534
Hey, pull it back.

1394
01:26:03,534 --> 01:26:04,994
- Scuttle, pull it back.

1395
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,459
What a clear night.

1396
01:26:14,003 --> 01:26:15,129
You can see Orion.

1397
01:26:17,047 --> 01:26:20,259
Oh, the... The sailors use the
constellations to navigate.

1398
01:26:21,802 --> 01:26:23,637
That one's Orion, the hunter.

1399
01:26:25,890 --> 01:26:28,434
There's Aries, the ram.

1400
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:31,979
That's Cassiopeia.

1401
01:26:33,272 --> 01:26:34,440
That's funny.

1402
01:26:34,440 --> 01:26:36,650
I still don't know your name.

1403
01:26:38,402 --> 01:26:41,030
Let's see. Is it...

1404
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:43,032
Diana?

1405
01:26:44,283 --> 01:26:45,284
No?

1406
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,828
Or...

1407
01:26:48,746 --> 01:26:50,080
Katherine?

1408
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:53,500
No, definitely not Katherine.

1409
01:26:55,002 --> 01:26:56,337
How...

1410
01:26:59,924 --> 01:27:01,508
Sky...

1411
01:27:01,508 --> 01:27:02,718
Uh...

1412
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:07,848
Aries?

1413
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:09,892
Aries.

1414
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:11,977
Arie...

1415
01:27:13,437 --> 01:27:14,438
Ari-el.

1416
01:27:16,106 --> 01:27:17,149
Ariel?

1417
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:20,069
Ari-el?

1418
01:27:21,779 --> 01:27:22,988
Ariel.

1419
01:27:25,866 --> 01:27:27,326
That's a beautiful name.

1420
01:27:32,373 --> 01:27:33,666
Written in the stars.

1421
01:27:40,089 --> 01:27:42,174
<i>Now's your moment</i>

1422
01:27:42,174 --> 01:27:45,761
<i>- Ooh, ooh-ooh
- Floating in a blue lagoon</i>

1423
01:27:46,095 --> 01:27:48,973
<i>- Ooh-ooh, boy, do it soon
- Boy, you better do it soon</i>

1424
01:27:49,139 --> 01:27:52,685
<i>No time will be better</i>

1425
01:27:53,644 --> 01:27:55,396
<i>She don't say a word</i>

1426
01:27:55,562 --> 01:27:58,190
<i>And she won't say a word
Until you</i>

1427
01:27:58,357 --> 01:27:59,858
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1428
01:28:00,025 --> 01:28:01,735
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1429
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:04,571
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1430
01:28:05,948 --> 01:28:07,032
<i>Sha la la la la</i>

1431
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:08,158
<i>Don't be scared</i>

1432
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:09,994
<i>You got the mood prepared</i>

1433
01:28:10,160 --> 01:28:12,037
<i>- Go on and kiss the girl
- Kiss the girl</i>

1434
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:14,373
<i>- Wow, wow
- Sha la la la la la</i>

1435
01:28:14,540 --> 01:28:15,541
<i>Don't stop now</i>

1436
01:28:15,708 --> 01:28:18,335
<i>Don't try to hide it
How you wanna</i>

1437
01:28:18,335 --> 01:28:19,628
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1438
01:28:20,254 --> 01:28:21,672
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

1439
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:22,923
<i>Float along</i>

1440
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:24,591
<i>And listen to the song</i>

1441
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:25,676
<i>The song say</i>

1442
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:27,594
<i>"Kiss the girl"</i>

1443
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:28,804
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

1444
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,222
<i>The music play</i>

1445
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:31,849
<i>Do what the music say</i>

1446
01:28:31,849 --> 01:28:32,975
- Oh!
<i>- You gotta</i>

1447
01:28:32,975 --> 01:28:35,561
<i>- Kiss the girl</i>

1448
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:36,645
<i>You gotta</i>

1449
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:39,148
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1450
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:40,315
<i>Why don't you</i>

1451
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,067
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1452
01:28:43,068 --> 01:28:45,904
<i>- Come on and
- Kiss the girl</i>

1453
01:28:46,071 --> 01:28:47,489
<i>Go on and</i>

1454
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,658
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

1455
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,999
What...
What was that?

1456
01:29:06,050 --> 01:29:07,801
That was close.

1457
01:29:07,968 --> 01:29:09,219
Too close.

1458
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,431
I don't get it.

1459
01:29:12,598 --> 01:29:14,975
I didn't think that little
barracuda stood a chance

1460
01:29:14,975 --> 01:29:17,936
luring him in
without her voice.

1461
01:29:18,103 --> 01:29:20,314
How's that even possible?

1462
01:29:20,481 --> 01:29:22,733
Well, we're not gonna
let that happen again.

1463
01:29:23,776 --> 01:29:27,404
It's time Ursula took matters
into her own tentacles.

1464
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:29,114
Where is it?

1465
01:29:29,281 --> 01:29:32,201
Come on, come on.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

1466
01:29:32,618 --> 01:29:35,412
No! No!

1467
01:29:36,246 --> 01:29:38,415
Nobody ever puts
my things back!

1468
01:29:40,876 --> 01:29:42,753
No! Where is it?

1469
01:29:50,552 --> 01:29:53,889
No, no, no!

1470
01:29:54,056 --> 01:29:57,434
No!

1471
01:29:57,601 --> 01:29:59,019
Oh, there it is.

1472
01:29:59,186 --> 01:30:01,230
I got it.

1473
01:30:01,230 --> 01:30:04,525
That Prince won't know
what hit him.

1474
01:30:05,234 --> 01:30:08,278
Only one more sunset

1475
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:10,614
and then I'll make
Triton writhe.

1476
01:30:12,616 --> 01:30:16,537
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook.

1477
01:30:25,671 --> 01:30:26,672
So where is she?

1478
01:30:26,672 --> 01:30:28,465
We don't know, Father.
She's gone.

1479
01:30:28,632 --> 01:30:29,883
What do you mean,
she's gone?

1480
01:30:30,050 --> 01:30:31,301
We've been looking
and looking.

1481
01:30:31,468 --> 01:30:32,636
There's no sign
of her anywhere.

1482
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:34,847
- She's not in these waters.
- Then look again.

1483
01:30:34,847 --> 01:30:37,057
Search all of the Seven Seas
if you have to.

1484
01:30:39,059 --> 01:30:40,227
Ariel wouldn't dare
go above again.

1485
01:30:40,227 --> 01:30:41,436
Don't even think
such a thing.

1486
01:30:42,563 --> 01:30:44,690
Doesn't make sense.
Why would she leave?

1487
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:46,358
I... I have no idea.

1488
01:30:46,525 --> 01:30:48,610
Never mind that.
Just find her.

1489
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,261
What have I done?

1490
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:28,650
Everyone's asleep.

1491
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,736
- We should probably be quiet.
In his room,

1492
01:31:30,736 --> 01:31:31,945
- all day?
Wait.

1493
01:31:31,945 --> 01:31:33,030
- Go. Oh, no.
I haven't seen him once.

1494
01:31:33,030 --> 01:31:34,531
Go, go. Go in there.
Go. Careful.

1495
01:31:34,531 --> 01:31:35,908
I imagine he's just resting.

1496
01:31:36,074 --> 01:31:37,242
Has he been avoiding me?

1497
01:31:37,409 --> 01:31:38,452
No, Your Majesty.

1498
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:40,996
- No?
- No.

1499
01:31:40,996 --> 01:31:42,623
You seem
awfully certain.

1500
01:31:42,623 --> 01:31:43,707
Avoiding you?

1501
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:44,958
Doesn't seem like Eric,
does it?

1502
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,043
Then where is he?

1503
01:31:46,418 --> 01:31:49,213
Oh, he's not searching
for that fantasy girl, I hope.

1504
01:31:50,839 --> 01:31:51,882
No, Your Majesty.

1505
01:31:52,049 --> 01:31:53,717
That I can say with certainty.

1506
01:31:53,884 --> 01:31:55,761
Thank heavens
for small blessings.

1507
01:31:55,761 --> 01:31:57,095
Oh!

1508
01:31:57,095 --> 01:31:58,513
- It's wet.

1509
01:31:59,473 --> 01:32:00,474
I will look into it.

1510
01:32:00,474 --> 01:32:02,851
You really must get
some rest yourself.

1511
01:32:03,018 --> 01:32:04,561
Yes,
I suppose I should.

1512
01:32:04,728 --> 01:32:06,480
Thank you, Grimsby.
Good night.

1513
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,689
Ma'am.

1514
01:32:07,856 --> 01:32:09,524
Sorry about that.

1515
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:12,402
I wasn't supposed
to leave the castle today.

1516
01:32:12,569 --> 01:32:13,820
But I'm glad I did.

1517
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:17,407
All these rules...

1518
01:32:19,076 --> 01:32:22,079
The truth is,
I wasn't born to all this,

1519
01:32:22,246 --> 01:32:23,622
and it all makes me feel
a little uneasy...

1520
01:32:23,622 --> 01:32:25,874
- Welcome back, sire.
- Oh, Grimsby.

1521
01:32:25,874 --> 01:32:27,167
Uh...

1522
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:28,460
Uh...

1523
01:32:28,460 --> 01:32:31,171
I trust you two had
a pleasant outing.

1524
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:32,631
Uh, yes, we did. Didn't we?

1525
01:32:32,798 --> 01:32:34,466
Yes. Very nice.

1526
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:36,009
You've had a long day, Miss.

1527
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:38,553
I imagine we should
let you get some sleep.

1528
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:40,931
And perhaps dried off as well.

1529
01:32:40,931 --> 01:32:42,182
Oh, uh... Yes.

1530
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:44,309
We... We took a rowboat out
onto the lagoon,

1531
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,144
and I'm afraid
we ended up in it.

1532
01:32:47,229 --> 01:32:49,231
Anyway, good night.

1533
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,235
Oh.

1534
01:32:58,782 --> 01:32:59,783
Good night...

1535
01:33:00,951 --> 01:33:02,202
Ariel.

1536
01:33:09,126 --> 01:33:11,086
About the carriages, sire,

1537
01:33:11,712 --> 01:33:13,046
I'm afraid they, uh,

1538
01:33:14,131 --> 01:33:16,049
didn't find the mystery girl.

1539
01:33:17,092 --> 01:33:18,093
They didn't?

1540
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,763
Oh.

1541
01:33:22,764 --> 01:33:24,516
May I then ask,

1542
01:33:24,683 --> 01:33:26,727
should we continue the search?

1543
01:33:29,271 --> 01:33:30,480
Grimsby, um...

1544
01:33:31,523 --> 01:33:32,733
I just...

1545
01:33:33,734 --> 01:33:35,319
I feel a little...

1546
01:33:36,862 --> 01:33:40,157
Well, if you want the advice
of an old man, sire,

1547
01:33:41,408 --> 01:33:44,119
don't be held back
by what you think should be.

1548
01:33:44,953 --> 01:33:46,747
Think only of what is.

1549
01:33:48,206 --> 01:33:49,207
Good night, sire.

1550
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:20,358
Hey! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

1551
01:36:20,525 --> 01:36:21,693
What?

1552
01:36:21,860 --> 01:36:23,278
<i>Hey, have you
Not heard the scuttlebutt?</i>

1553
01:36:23,278 --> 01:36:24,362
Your butt?

1554
01:36:24,362 --> 01:36:25,822
<i>No, the gossip, the buzz</i>

1555
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:27,324
<i>The who-said-what-
who-does-that</i>

1556
01:36:27,324 --> 01:36:28,617
<i>Yeah, the scuttlebutt</i>

1557
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:30,619
<i>Well, I was flying
Over land and sea</i>

1558
01:36:30,619 --> 01:36:31,745
<i>An ear to the ground</i>

1559
01:36:31,745 --> 01:36:33,997
<i>Then I came flying here
For you to see</i>

1560
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,123
<i>And hear what I found</i>

1561
01:36:35,123 --> 01:36:36,374
<i>Remember the swamp?</i>

1562
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,210
<i>Remember my song in the swamp
When I was like</i>

1563
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:40,378
<i>"Womp chicka womp womp
Chicka womp womp"</i>

1564
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:41,463
I remember.

1565
01:36:41,463 --> 01:36:42,547
<i>Well, ever since</i>

1566
01:36:42,547 --> 01:36:43,632
<i>The what's his name?</i>

1567
01:36:43,632 --> 01:36:45,175
<i>The guy with the hair
And the shirt</i>

1568
01:36:45,175 --> 01:36:46,510
- The Prince.
<i>- Yeah, the Prince</i>

1569
01:36:46,676 --> 01:36:48,678
<i>Has been dropping hints
He wants to</i>

1570
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:49,804
<i>You know when humans</i>

1571
01:36:49,804 --> 01:36:51,473
<i>Dress all nice
Like they're penguins?</i>

1572
01:36:51,473 --> 01:36:52,766
<i>Throw rice for the pigeons?</i>

1573
01:36:52,766 --> 01:36:54,267
<i>They're trying to blow up
The pigeons</i>

1574
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:55,852
<i>But those are
Just urban legends</i>

1575
01:36:55,852 --> 01:36:57,979
<i>I know a lot
Of really fat pigeons</i>

1576
01:36:57,979 --> 01:36:59,064
Scuttle...

1577
01:36:59,064 --> 01:37:00,732
<i>Will you Just listen,
Sebastian?</i>

1578
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:02,817
<i>- I got the scuttlebutt</i>
- Hurry up.

1579
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,487
<i>You'll be like, "What?"
When I drop that scuttlebutt</i>

1580
01:37:05,487 --> 01:37:07,489
<i>Okay, now
Huddle up, buttercup</i>

1581
01:37:07,656 --> 01:37:09,074
<i>From the women
Who wash all the clothes</i>

1582
01:37:09,241 --> 01:37:10,659
<i>To the hunter
Who arrows the bows</i>

1583
01:37:10,825 --> 01:37:11,910
<i>The chatter
All over the palace</i>

1584
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:12,994
<i>Is that your Prince Eric</i>

1585
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:14,162
<i>- Is gonna propose</i>
What?

1586
01:37:14,162 --> 01:37:15,497
<i>To somebody</i> n<i>obody knows</i>

1587
01:37:15,497 --> 01:37:16,831
<i>They're saying
He suddenly chose</i>

1588
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:17,916
- Who?
<i>- Who?</i>

1589
01:37:17,916 --> 01:37:19,543
<i>You sound like an owl
I'll bet it's the kid</i>

1590
01:37:19,543 --> 01:37:20,961
<i>- With the new set of toes
-</i> No!

1591
01:37:20,961 --> 01:37:23,338
<i>Oh, yes, anything goes
Who'd ever guess</i>

1592
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:24,881
<i>Our little Ariel's
Marriage material?</i>

1593
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,007
<i>Time for the rice
And the dress</i>

1594
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,092
<i>And the what do you call it?</i>

1595
01:37:27,092 --> 01:37:29,219
<i>The thing with the lips
When they press</i>

1596
01:37:29,386 --> 01:37:30,971
<i>I don't have lips
I have a beak</i>

1597
01:37:31,137 --> 01:37:32,597
<i>So I guess I could give you
A peck on the cheek</i>

1598
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:33,890
I don't believe it.

1599
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:35,892
Say, you're awfully quiet.

1600
01:37:37,018 --> 01:37:38,728
Oh, yeah. So, uh, what now?

1601
01:37:38,728 --> 01:37:40,021
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1602
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:42,065
<i>Can you believe
The scuttlebutt?</i>

1603
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:43,650
Get dressed, child.

1604
01:37:43,817 --> 01:37:45,235
<i>You're welcome
For the scuttlebutt</i>

1605
01:37:45,235 --> 01:37:47,654
We got a lot
of work to do before sundown.

1606
01:37:47,654 --> 01:37:49,239
<i>The s-s-s-s-scuttlebutt
Scuttlebutt, hey!</i>

1607
01:37:49,239 --> 01:37:51,408
Oh, please
let this be the day.

1608
01:37:51,408 --> 01:37:53,201
<i>- Let's go, let's go, let's go
- Let's go</i>

1609
01:37:53,201 --> 01:37:55,495
<i>We got it, the gossip
The buzz</i>

1610
01:37:55,662 --> 01:37:56,830
<i>The who-said-what-
who-does-that</i>

1611
01:37:56,830 --> 01:37:58,832
<i>Yeah, I told you so
Let's go, let's go, let's go</i>

1612
01:37:58,832 --> 01:38:00,125
<i>We gotta go
Before the sun goes down</i>

1613
01:38:00,125 --> 01:38:01,209
<i>What? Got to get her ready</i>

1614
01:38:01,209 --> 01:38:02,294
<i>- For the big showdown
- Right</i>

1615
01:38:02,294 --> 01:38:03,378
<i>Go ahead and get her
Out of bed</i>

1616
01:38:03,378 --> 01:38:04,462
<i>And get her ready
For the wedding</i>

1617
01:38:04,462 --> 01:38:05,547
<i>Sun is setting
So we can't slow down</i>

1618
01:38:05,547 --> 01:38:07,549
<i>The scuttlebutt</i>

1619
01:38:12,804 --> 01:38:14,055
Scuttle,
you're too close.

1620
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:24,983
Oh!

1621
01:38:26,276 --> 01:38:28,695
My goodness,
it is wonderful news.

1622
01:38:28,695 --> 01:38:30,697
- Isn't it, Grimsby?
Oh, yes.

1623
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:33,783
I must admit,
I was mistaken.

1624
01:38:34,492 --> 01:38:35,869
It seems you really
have found

1625
01:38:35,869 --> 01:38:38,079
the girl of your dreams
after all.

1626
01:38:38,246 --> 01:38:40,999
Yes. Quite the surprise, Eric.

1627
01:38:42,125 --> 01:38:43,126
What?

1628
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,128
Oh. Uh, I know.

1629
01:38:45,128 --> 01:38:46,755
I know it must seem fast,

1630
01:38:46,755 --> 01:38:49,549
but... but I do owe her
my life.

1631
01:38:49,549 --> 01:38:50,675
We will celebrate.

1632
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,010
This evening.

1633
01:38:52,177 --> 01:38:54,763
You shall introduce
your intended to the court.

1634
01:38:55,347 --> 01:38:57,140
We can make that happen,
can't we, Grimsby?

1635
01:38:57,140 --> 01:38:58,266
Yes.

1636
01:38:58,266 --> 01:39:00,518
If it's really
what you want, Eric.

1637
01:39:01,811 --> 01:39:03,688
What I... want?

1638
01:39:03,688 --> 01:39:06,107
It's...

1639
01:39:06,900 --> 01:39:08,526
It's what we both want.

1640
01:39:09,444 --> 01:39:10,904
Lovely.

1641
01:39:11,071 --> 01:39:12,697
Well, we've got our work
cut out for us.

1642
01:39:12,697 --> 01:39:14,157
Mm-hmm. Indeed.

1643
01:39:14,324 --> 01:39:16,701
Then let's
begin preparations. Grimsby...

1644
01:39:20,622 --> 01:39:22,248
Oh, Ariel, girl.

1645
01:39:22,415 --> 01:39:23,667
Where have you gone?

1646
01:39:24,959 --> 01:39:26,795
- Yeah. Any sign of her?
- No luck.

1647
01:39:26,961 --> 01:39:28,713
I flew over the village
three times.

1648
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:30,298
Well, check the castle again!

1649
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,634
It's almost sunset.
We got to find her.

1650
01:39:32,634 --> 01:39:33,718
Copy that.

1651
01:39:33,718 --> 01:39:35,428
What's wrong
with that fool Prince?

1652
01:39:35,428 --> 01:39:37,263
Something fishy going on here.
I don't like

1653
01:39:37,263 --> 01:39:38,348
- the smell of it... Hey.
Sebastian!

1654
01:39:38,348 --> 01:39:39,432
- Over here.
- Yeah, what?

1655
01:39:39,432 --> 01:39:40,558
I coming, I coming. Hold on.

1656
01:39:41,142 --> 01:39:42,143
Yes, what?

1657
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:43,812
I think I know where Ariel is.

1658
01:39:43,978 --> 01:39:45,146
Well, what are we waiting for?

1659
01:39:45,146 --> 01:39:46,648
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

1660
01:39:55,407 --> 01:39:57,283
Ariel?

1661
01:40:30,066 --> 01:40:31,901
So long, Red.

1662
01:40:39,534 --> 01:40:41,286
Oh, no!

1663
01:41:08,271 --> 01:41:10,690
<i>Risking it all</i>

1664
01:41:10,857 --> 01:41:13,193
<i>Only to fall</i>

1665
01:41:13,359 --> 01:41:17,071
<i>Back where I started</i>

1666
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:19,282
<i>Back near the shore</i>

1667
01:41:19,449 --> 01:41:21,618
<i>Back to before</i>

1668
01:41:21,785 --> 01:41:25,330
<i>You took my hand</i>

1669
01:41:26,456 --> 01:41:28,500
<i>Bet ya on land</i>

1670
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,668
<i>They understand</i>

1671
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:36,758
<i>And they don't
Strand you brokenhearted</i>

1672
01:41:39,177 --> 01:41:43,306
<i>What did I give to live
Where you are?</i>

1673
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:50,897
<i>Where do I go
With nowhere to turn to?</i>

1674
01:41:57,028 --> 01:41:59,030
Hey,
what are you doin', child?

1675
01:41:59,197 --> 01:42:01,241
You can't give up so easily.

1676
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:04,077
This all has to be
some sort of misunderstanding.

1677
01:42:04,619 --> 01:42:05,870
I watched both of you.

1678
01:42:05,870 --> 01:42:07,580
You're meant to be together.

1679
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,707
There you are.
I've been lookin'.

1680
01:42:09,707 --> 01:42:12,001
And I... And I thought
I found you, 'cause I heard.

1681
01:42:12,168 --> 01:42:14,587
But... But then
I saw it wasn't you.

1682
01:42:14,587 --> 01:42:15,672
It... It was her!

1683
01:42:15,672 --> 01:42:16,756
But... But it wasn't...

1684
01:42:16,756 --> 01:42:18,466
In the mirror,
except she had...

1685
01:42:18,466 --> 01:42:19,551
She had your voice!

1686
01:42:19,551 --> 01:42:20,885
What are you talkin' about?

1687
01:42:21,386 --> 01:42:22,846
Don't you get
what I'm tellin' you?

1688
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:25,598
- No!
- The Prince has been tricked.

1689
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,267
That lady who showed up

1690
01:42:27,267 --> 01:42:29,269
is actually
the Sea Witch in disguise.

1691
01:42:29,769 --> 01:42:30,979
Are you sure about this?

1692
01:42:30,979 --> 01:42:32,397
Of course I'm sure!

1693
01:42:32,564 --> 01:42:33,690
Have I ever been wrong?

1694
01:42:33,690 --> 01:42:35,608
I mean, like, you know,
when it counts?

1695
01:42:35,775 --> 01:42:37,277
Well, what are we gonna do?

1696
01:42:37,443 --> 01:42:38,611
Well, we have to do something

1697
01:42:38,611 --> 01:42:41,990
before Prince Eric ends up
with that slimy squid.

1698
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:43,741
Yes, girl, go!

1699
01:42:43,908 --> 01:42:45,994
Flounder, go tell the Sea King
what's happened.

1700
01:42:46,160 --> 01:42:47,412
He has to know everything.

1701
01:42:47,412 --> 01:42:48,538
- Okay.
Oh...

1702
01:42:48,705 --> 01:42:49,998
What do I... What...
What do I do?

1703
01:42:49,998 --> 01:42:51,583
You give me a lift
to the castle.

1704
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:55,378
We got to find a way
to stall that engagement.

1705
01:43:02,135 --> 01:43:04,178
Really is very special.

1706
01:43:04,178 --> 01:43:06,472
Heroism's too strong
a word for it,

1707
01:43:08,016 --> 01:43:09,851
but I suppose I did save Eric.

1708
01:43:10,977 --> 01:43:12,687
- That's what anyone would do.
Of course.

1709
01:43:12,687 --> 01:43:14,147
- Grimsby.
Sire.

1710
01:43:14,939 --> 01:43:16,190
Have you seen Ariel?

1711
01:43:16,357 --> 01:43:17,400
According to the servants,

1712
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:18,943
she left the castle
early this morning.

1713
01:43:19,110 --> 01:43:20,153
Left?

1714
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,946
Can you blame her, Eric?

1715
01:43:21,946 --> 01:43:24,532
I don't understand.
This is not like you.

1716
01:43:25,575 --> 01:43:27,118
I'm not sure
I understand it myself.

1717
01:43:28,620 --> 01:43:30,204
I just wanted to...

1718
01:43:30,371 --> 01:43:31,664
- I thought if...
Eric.

1719
01:43:32,582 --> 01:43:33,583
Thank you.

1720
01:43:36,169 --> 01:43:38,087
I don't really know
what I wanted.

1721
01:43:47,347 --> 01:43:48,932
Almost there!

1722
01:43:49,098 --> 01:43:52,936
Now, when I give the signal,
you drop me!

1723
01:43:53,102 --> 01:43:54,312
- Got it?
- Got it.

1724
01:43:54,479 --> 01:43:56,189
No, you idiot...

1725
01:43:57,565 --> 01:43:58,983
Guess I'm on my own.

1726
01:44:02,362 --> 01:44:04,072
My darling,

1727
01:44:04,072 --> 01:44:07,408
this belonged to my mother.

1728
01:44:07,575 --> 01:44:09,327
And I'd like you to have it.

1729
01:44:10,328 --> 01:44:13,206
Your happiness means
everything to me.

1730
01:44:13,206 --> 01:44:14,415
You're very sweet, um...

1731
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:17,126
Uh, would you excuse me?

1732
01:44:23,383 --> 01:44:24,467
Enjoy yourself.

1733
01:44:27,762 --> 01:44:29,138
Oh, Eric.

1734
01:44:29,138 --> 01:44:31,349
- It's beautiful.

1735
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:35,311
- What in the...
- The ring.

1736
01:44:35,478 --> 01:44:36,938
The ring. I lost...

1737
01:44:37,105 --> 01:44:38,773
Has anybody seen the ring?

1738
01:44:38,773 --> 01:44:39,857
Have you seen the ring?

1739
01:44:40,817 --> 01:44:41,818
Have you seen it?

1740
01:44:43,528 --> 01:44:45,405
Get off me, you filthy bird!

1741
01:44:51,035 --> 01:44:53,871
Help me! I'm being attacked!

1742
01:44:56,082 --> 01:44:58,668
Ariel! Ariel,
I've been looking for you.

1743
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:00,670
Who is that?

1744
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:02,338
What are you doing?

1745
01:45:03,589 --> 01:45:04,924
- Grimsby, let me go!
- Sire!

1746
01:45:04,924 --> 01:45:06,300
Get her away from me!

1747
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:07,468
She's insane!

1748
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:08,970
What's going on?

1749
01:45:09,345 --> 01:45:10,847
Ariel, stop!

1750
01:45:13,307 --> 01:45:14,308
- Get off!

1751
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:47,717
Ariel.

1752
01:45:48,676 --> 01:45:49,844
Yes.

1753
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:52,388
It was you all along.

1754
01:45:53,931 --> 01:45:54,932
I should've known.

1755
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:58,936
I don't know
what came over me.

1756
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:00,188
She bewitched you.

1757
01:46:00,188 --> 01:46:01,647
Get away from her!

1758
01:46:01,647 --> 01:46:02,982
Eric, I want you to know I...

1759
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:04,233
Oh, just kiss!

1760
01:46:04,233 --> 01:46:05,318
I want you to know everything.

1761
01:46:05,318 --> 01:46:06,486
Nothing matters now.

1762
01:46:08,738 --> 01:46:10,031
No!

1763
01:46:23,836 --> 01:46:26,547
Oh, good Lord.
She's a sea creature.

1764
01:46:27,256 --> 01:46:29,509
You're too late!

1765
01:46:30,885 --> 01:46:34,430
You're too late!

1766
01:46:43,314 --> 01:46:44,315
Stay back!

1767
01:46:44,482 --> 01:46:45,650
Shut up!

1768
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:49,278
Eric!

1769
01:46:55,660 --> 01:46:57,912
- Eric, no.

1770
01:46:57,912 --> 01:46:59,205
This is the work
of the sea gods.

1771
01:46:59,205 --> 01:47:00,289
I warned you.

1772
01:47:00,289 --> 01:47:01,833
Their whole world is evil.

1773
01:47:01,999 --> 01:47:04,210
Eric, wait! Eric!

1774
01:47:08,089 --> 01:47:09,882
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

1775
01:47:10,049 --> 01:47:12,510
Not a chance. You made
a deal, remember?

1776
01:47:12,677 --> 01:47:14,178
Three days, no kiss.

1777
01:47:15,346 --> 01:47:17,598
Yeah, is it all comin'
back to ya?

1778
01:47:18,391 --> 01:47:20,101
I thought so.

1779
01:47:20,268 --> 01:47:22,478
Well, now you gotta live
with it, toots.

1780
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:36,659
Ursula!

1781
01:47:38,077 --> 01:47:40,413
Let her go.

1782
01:47:40,580 --> 01:47:42,248
Forget it,
Big Brother.

1783
01:47:42,415 --> 01:47:44,917
She belongs to me now.

1784
01:47:49,422 --> 01:47:51,048
Oh, you see?

1785
01:47:51,465 --> 01:47:53,134
We made a deal.

1786
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,552
In blood.

1787
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:57,430
It's unbreakable,
even for you.

1788
01:47:57,930 --> 01:48:00,266
I'm sorry, Father.
This is all my fault.

1789
01:48:00,433 --> 01:48:02,101
What do you want
with my daughter?

1790
01:48:02,101 --> 01:48:03,186
Oh.

1791
01:48:03,644 --> 01:48:05,229
Nothing.

1792
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:07,190
It's you I want.

1793
01:48:07,356 --> 01:48:09,108
I want to see you suffer,

1794
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:11,319
like I've suffered
all these years.

1795
01:48:12,278 --> 01:48:15,656
And the daughter
of the great Sea King

1796
01:48:15,823 --> 01:48:18,242
is a very precious commodity.

1797
01:48:18,784 --> 01:48:21,204
Oh, poor, unfortunate soul.

1798
01:48:21,871 --> 01:48:23,456
Hey! Get her, boys!

1799
01:48:27,585 --> 01:48:29,712
Uh-uh. I wouldn't.

1800
01:48:31,839 --> 01:48:33,132
Shocking, isn't it?

1801
01:48:34,717 --> 01:48:36,302
Of course, I always was a gal

1802
01:48:36,302 --> 01:48:38,471
with an eye for a bargain.

1803
01:48:38,888 --> 01:48:42,016
What do you say
to a trade, hmm?

1804
01:48:42,183 --> 01:48:44,560
What's your precious
little Ariel worth to ya?

1805
01:48:58,783 --> 01:49:00,826
It's mine now.

1806
01:49:07,208 --> 01:49:08,459
No!

1807
01:49:10,670 --> 01:49:12,129
Father!

1808
01:49:28,604 --> 01:49:29,730
You...

1809
01:49:30,106 --> 01:49:31,357
You monster!

1810
01:49:33,484 --> 01:49:35,486
Don't be a fool,
you little brat!

1811
01:49:36,404 --> 01:49:37,822
You are powerless against...

1812
01:49:39,699 --> 01:49:41,409
You're gonna pay for that.

1813
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:43,619
Get him!

1814
01:49:52,628 --> 01:49:55,756
Say goodbye
to your human heartthrob.

1815
01:49:55,923 --> 01:49:57,550
- Don't!

1816
01:49:58,926 --> 01:49:59,927
Ahh!

1817
01:50:00,428 --> 01:50:01,470
My babies!

1818
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:30,750
Eric!

1819
01:50:37,256 --> 01:50:38,841
Get to shore. She'll kill you!

1820
01:50:39,383 --> 01:50:41,677
- I'm not leaving you!

1821
01:50:53,397 --> 01:50:56,067
Yes!

1822
01:50:56,609 --> 01:50:57,985
Give me your hand!

1823
01:51:01,572 --> 01:51:02,656
Now!

1824
01:51:13,334 --> 01:51:14,335
Look out!

1825
01:51:18,339 --> 01:51:21,092
Now I rule the seas

1826
01:51:21,258 --> 01:51:25,471
and all will be helpless
under my power!

1827
01:51:29,892 --> 01:51:31,143
No!

1828
01:51:31,977 --> 01:51:35,064
So much for true love.

1829
01:52:39,128 --> 01:52:41,672
So long, lover boy.

1830
01:55:24,084 --> 01:55:26,378
You gave your life for me.

1831
01:55:29,506 --> 01:55:32,384
And you fought
to get my life back.

1832
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:37,556
I didn't fight alone, Father.

1833
01:55:39,099 --> 01:55:41,560
Eric was with me.

1834
01:55:44,730 --> 01:55:48,776
All that matters now is
that you're safe and home.

1835
01:55:50,486 --> 01:55:51,862
Where you belong.

1836
01:56:25,813 --> 01:56:27,856
Sire, please!
- We need a boat.

1837
01:56:27,856 --> 01:56:30,109
Grimsby, we have to find her!

1838
01:56:30,109 --> 01:56:31,402
And then what?

1839
01:56:36,448 --> 01:56:39,660
And then what, Eric?

1840
01:56:42,204 --> 01:56:43,330
Darling.

1841
01:56:45,082 --> 01:56:46,291
You were right.

1842
01:56:48,001 --> 01:56:49,712
I was chasing
after a fantasy girl.

1843
01:56:49,712 --> 01:56:53,173
No. No, I was wrong.

1844
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:54,717
She was very real.

1845
01:56:55,551 --> 01:56:57,928
And so were your feelings
for her, I see that now.

1846
01:56:59,346 --> 01:57:00,514
It's just that...

1847
01:57:03,058 --> 01:57:05,519
our worlds were never meant
to be together.

1848
01:57:52,191 --> 01:57:53,650
Sebastian!

1849
01:57:58,363 --> 01:58:00,240
You gotta be kidding me.

1850
01:58:13,629 --> 01:58:15,255
Yes, Your Majesty.

1851
01:58:17,132 --> 01:58:20,719
I have always tried to do
what's best for our people.

1852
01:58:20,886 --> 01:58:22,596
Yes, Your Majesty.

1853
01:58:23,514 --> 01:58:25,641
And what's best
for my daughters.

1854
01:58:25,766 --> 01:58:27,476
Indeed, Your Majesty.

1855
01:58:28,727 --> 01:58:30,854
And I've done everything
in my power

1856
01:58:30,854 --> 01:58:32,981
to make her happy.

1857
01:58:35,609 --> 01:58:38,487
Well, not quite.

1858
01:58:47,037 --> 01:58:48,539
She wants
a different life

1859
01:58:48,539 --> 01:58:50,082
than I had planned for her.

1860
01:58:50,082 --> 01:58:52,835
She did try
to tell you, Your Majesty.

1861
01:58:54,795 --> 01:58:57,422
But I won't be able
to protect her anymore.

1862
01:58:57,589 --> 01:58:59,633
Well, it's like I always say,

1863
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,886
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

1864
01:59:03,053 --> 01:59:04,596
Oh, is that what
you always say?

1865
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:05,931
Somethin' like that. Yeah.

1866
01:59:09,852 --> 01:59:12,354
Then there's just
one problem left.

1867
01:59:12,521 --> 01:59:14,439
And what's that,
Your Majesty?

1868
01:59:16,066 --> 01:59:18,360
How much I'm going
to miss my little one.

1869
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:52,561
Good boy. Go on.

1870
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:04,865
Again?

1871
02:00:18,921 --> 02:00:19,922
Max?

1872
02:01:17,813 --> 02:01:19,815
Blessings to you both.

1873
02:01:20,816 --> 02:01:22,234
Magical news, yeah.

1874
02:01:22,401 --> 02:01:23,777
Oh, what's all this, Grims?

1875
02:01:23,944 --> 02:01:25,654
Oh, the Queen wanted
the two of you

1876
02:01:25,654 --> 02:01:27,781
to have
a proper send-off, sire.

1877
02:01:27,948 --> 02:01:29,324
Thank you, Your Majesty.

1878
02:01:29,491 --> 02:01:31,910
No. Thank you.

1879
02:01:32,077 --> 02:01:33,620
Much as I hate farewells,

1880
02:01:33,620 --> 02:01:36,456
we still have cause
to celebrate.

1881
02:01:36,623 --> 02:01:40,794
Our worlds have misunderstood
one another for far too long.

1882
02:01:40,961 --> 02:01:43,880
Your marriage marks
a new beginning for us.

1883
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:46,258
Yes. A beginning.

1884
02:01:47,009 --> 02:01:48,010
Now,

1885
02:01:48,593 --> 02:01:50,053
get out there

1886
02:01:50,220 --> 02:01:51,722
and change the world,

1887
02:01:51,888 --> 02:01:52,973
or whatever it is
you have to do,

1888
02:01:52,973 --> 02:01:54,057
so we don't get left behind.

1889
02:01:54,975 --> 02:01:56,435
That doesn't sound
like my mother.

1890
02:01:56,435 --> 02:01:57,978
- What have you done with her?
- Oh!

1891
02:01:57,978 --> 02:02:00,230
- Off you go.

1892
02:02:01,440 --> 02:02:03,734
Have you decided
where you're headed first?

1893
02:02:05,360 --> 02:02:06,778
- Uncharted waters.

1894
02:02:06,778 --> 02:02:07,904
Okay!

1895
02:02:07,904 --> 02:02:09,281
A mermaid and a man.

1896
02:02:10,323 --> 02:02:11,908
Whoever would have imagined?

1897
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:17,748
Well, look who's here.

1898
02:02:18,331 --> 02:02:20,292
- We got you something, Ariel.
- Sure did.

1899
02:02:20,292 --> 02:02:22,169
Something you almost lost.

1900
02:02:22,169 --> 02:02:23,336
Where... Where is it?

1901
02:02:23,336 --> 02:02:25,088
You're sittin' on it, bird.

1902
02:02:25,088 --> 02:02:26,381
Ow!

1903
02:02:27,966 --> 02:02:29,551
My little mermaid.

1904
02:02:32,387 --> 02:02:33,972
Keep her for me.

1905
02:02:34,139 --> 02:02:36,641
I hope she causes you
less trouble than I did.

1906
02:02:36,808 --> 02:02:39,061
I was right about
the dinglehopper, wasn't I?

1907
02:02:39,436 --> 02:02:41,688
Yes, you were, Scuttle.
You were.

1908
02:02:41,855 --> 02:02:43,273
You won't
be gone too long,

1909
02:02:43,732 --> 02:02:45,609
- will you, Ariel?
Of course not.

1910
02:02:45,984 --> 02:02:47,652
I'll be back
by the next Coral Moon.

1911
02:02:48,779 --> 02:02:50,447
Yeah, don't be late this time.

1912
02:03:11,259 --> 02:03:12,260
You ready?

1913
02:03:15,555 --> 02:03:16,556
Yes.

1914
02:03:17,516 --> 02:03:19,059
Yes, I'm ready.

1915
02:03:59,057 --> 02:04:00,267
My child.

1916
02:04:05,438 --> 02:04:06,439
Eric.

1917
02:04:11,153 --> 02:04:13,113
Thank you for hearing me.

1918
02:04:14,823 --> 02:04:16,449
You shouldn't have had
to give up your voice

1919
02:04:16,449 --> 02:04:17,701
to be heard.

1920
02:04:18,493 --> 02:04:20,120
But now I am listening.

1921
02:04:22,455 --> 02:04:24,332
And I will always
be here for you.

1922
02:04:26,209 --> 02:04:27,335
We all will.

1923
02:05:12,005 --> 02:05:13,757
I love you, Father.

1924
02:06:01,304 --> 02:06:06,101
<i>The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake</i>

1925
02:06:06,268 --> 02:06:11,106
<i>You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake</i>

1926
02:06:11,273 --> 02:06:13,775
<i>Just look at the world
Around you</i>

1927
02:06:13,775 --> 02:06:16,111
<i>Right here on the ocean floor</i>

1928
02:06:16,278 --> 02:06:18,738
<i>Such wonderful things
Surround you</i>

1929
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:21,324
<i>What more is you lookin' for?</i>

{\an8}<i>Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter</i>

1932
02:06:28,957 --> 02:06:30,625
<i>Take it from me</i>

1933
02:06:31,543 --> 02:06:33,920
