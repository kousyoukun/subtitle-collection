00:01:32,103 --> 00:01:38,560
<i><b>THE LITTLE MERMAID</b></i>

2
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:53,100
More harpoons!

3
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,485
Ready the nets, mate.

4
00:01:54,586 --> 00:01:56,299
Hoist and kill her,
before she comes aboard.

5
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,024
Let me see, let me see!

6
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:00,205
Right, right, right!

7
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,599
She's a fast one!

8
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,702
Hand me another!

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,167
Hey! Hey!

10
00:02:18,268 --> 00:02:19,987
Move! Move!
Get back!

11
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,499
What are you doing?

12
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,399
- It's a mermaid!
- A mermaid? Use your eyes!

13
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,822
What were you thinking?

14
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,550
These are dangerous waters.

15
00:02:30,651 --> 00:02:32,299
And this is a dangerous time.

16
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,091
Tonight's the Coral Moon.

17
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:38,099
They say it's when the Sea King
calls his mermaid daughters together...

18
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,868
to lure men to their deaths.

19
00:02:39,969 --> 00:02:41,420
- Is that what they say?
- Aye!

20
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,883
Not even the strongest
can resist their spell.

21
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:45,553
Just an old lore!

22
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,353
Back to work!

23
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,249
- See that?
- See what?

24
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,399
Hawkins!

25
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,141
Crosswind gust kicked 
up the top, that's all!

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,032
That's the Sea King's doing!

27
00:03:00,264 --> 00:03:02,680
He would've sunk her himself,
if he could!

28
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,065
Where is Prince Eric?

29
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,932
Up on the bow, Sir Grimsby...

30
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:16,713
Eric!

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,696
What are you doing up there?

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,409
Get back here at once!

33
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,536
You ought to stop worrying 
so much about me, Grimsby!

34
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,725
Call me selfish but I don't 
want to tell the Queen...

35
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:30,634
that her son fell overboard,
on my watch.

36
00:03:30,966 --> 00:03:32,752
And on his birthday, 
of all days.

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,618
Looks like there is a
Spanish galleon out there,

38
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:38,299
headed toward the mainland.

39
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:41,372
We could follow it to port,
see what they've brought to trade.

40
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:44,160
Our ship is loaded 
to the gills as it is.

41
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:47,996
We've risked our necks out 
here for seven weeks already.

42
00:03:48,328 --> 00:03:50,446
We're going home tonight.

43
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:53,786
Eric, pay attention.

44
00:03:53,918 --> 00:03:55,834
I need you to be more careful.

45
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,165
My daughters of the seven seas,

46
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:01,382
I welcome news from 
all of your waters.

47
00:06:01,814 --> 00:06:06,212
Tamika, Perla,
it's so good to see you.

48
00:06:07,344 --> 00:06:09,879
Caspia, Indira,

49
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,976
it fills my heart to 
have you all here.

50
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,216
Mala, Karina.

51
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,518
Where is Ariel?

52
00:06:26,797 --> 00:06:28,478
Sebastian?

53
00:06:29,573 --> 00:06:32,742
You were supposed to see to it
that Ariel was here.

54
00:06:33,241 --> 00:06:38,058
I tried, your Majesty.
But that child, she's impossible.

55
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,633
I reminded her about the gathering
just this morning.

56
00:06:41,765 --> 00:06:44,170
What more can 
one crustacean do?

57
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,357
You can go find her.

58
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,415
Yes, your Majesty, right away.

59
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,099
Yes, your Majesty,
right away, your Majesty.

60
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,840
How hard can it be to find
a mermaid, after all?

61
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,683
If I'm lucky, I'll only have
to search one ocean.

62
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,623
Where are you, child?

63
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,183
We're not supposed to be
this far from the palace, Ariel.

64
00:08:01,415 --> 00:08:02,440
Let's go back.

65
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,530
How does that work?

66
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,899
Come on, Ariel, please?

67
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,556
Flounder, stop being such a guppy.

68
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,364
I'm not a guppy.

69
00:08:19,725 --> 00:08:21,835
I think we've gone far enough.

70
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:27,258
Wait, what is that?

71
00:08:27,717 --> 00:08:29,366
I've never seen that one.

72
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:32,567
Come on.

73
00:08:32,699 --> 00:08:34,829
Ariel, wait for me.

74
00:08:37,508 --> 00:08:39,728
You know I can't 
swim that fast.

75
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,716
Oh!
Look at all that.

76
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,399
They must have used this ship
for battles or something.

77
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,985
Yeah, great.
Now let's get out of here.

78
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,599
Getting cold fins?

79
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,674
Who me? No way!

80
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,858
Good! Then you can stay 
out here and watch for sharks.

81
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:15,510
Alright. Good.

82
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,130
What?

83
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:19,049
Ariel, wait!

84
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,899
Do you really think there 
might be sharks around here?

85
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,337
Oh, Flounder.

86
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,418
Look at this.

87
00:09:43,489 --> 00:09:46,012
It's the smallest trident
I have ever seen.

88
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,794
I am King Flounder,
lord of the seven seas.

89
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,070
I wonder why a human
I would need one that size.

90
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:56,795
I bet Scuttle will know.

91
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,843
She always does.

92
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,552
Will you relax?

93
00:10:02,653 --> 00:10:04,270
It's just your reflection.

94
00:10:04,802 --> 00:10:06,371
Calm down.

95
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:08,850
Nothing is going to happen.

96
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,420
Flounder, look out!

97
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,112
Flounder!

98
00:11:32,397 --> 00:11:34,156
Are you okay Flounder?

99
00:11:34,257 --> 00:11:37,797
Sure. I mean, I've seen
bigger sharks, just...

100
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,545
You know, you can't back down.

101
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,624
You gotta show 
them who's in...

102
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,567
Come back, Flounder!
It's just Scuttle.

103
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,872
Ariel! Hey, kid, how 
are you doing?

104
00:11:56,973 --> 00:11:58,987
Don't mind me, I was just
grabbing a snack.

105
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,699
Scuttle,
we found more treasure.

106
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,349
Yeah, we went into this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy.

107
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,103
Human stuff! A-ha!

108
00:12:06,204 --> 00:12:08,416
Alright, alright, let me see.
Let me see.

109
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:10,401
Any idea what this is?

110
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,433
Wow! This...

111
00:12:14,565 --> 00:12:16,013
This is... Yeah.

112
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:17,821
This is very, very unusual.

113
00:12:17,922 --> 00:12:18,699
What? What is it?

114
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,771
It's a...
It's a dinglehopper.

115
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,699
- Dinglehopper?
- Yeah. Yeah.

116
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:27,599
Humans use these
babies to style their hair.

117
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,088
You just give it a little twirl,
little... yanking,

118
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,574
got some pieces with it...

119
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,002
And you're left with an artistically 
pleasing conflagration of hair

120
00:12:35,103 --> 00:12:36,476
that humans go nuts for.

121
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,499
Really?
I would love to see that.

122
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,350
You can't.

123
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:41,535
- Flounder!
- You know it's true.

124
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,848
Your father still won't let you
go to the surface, huh?

125
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,099
No, it's forbidden.

126
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,601
He thinks all humans 
are... barbarians...

127
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,787
They're not so bad.

128
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,666
Unless you're a coconut.

129
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,099
They hate coconuts.

130
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,599
That's right. They get a hold 
of one, they'd smash it to pieces,

131
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,499
just like that. It's weird.

132
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,099
- And what's this?
- Ariel!

133
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,299
...cross the whole ocean
looking for this child...

134
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,515
Ariel!

135
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,599
Sebastian!
Sorry about that.

136
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,038
Ariel, what are you doing up there?

137
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:10,238
Wasting your time with
this loon bird...

138
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:12,099
Who can't tell 
swimmin' from flyin'?

139
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,799
Hey!

140
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,055
I suppose you've 
completely forgotten

141
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,921
tonight is 
the Coral Moon.

142
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,399
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

143
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,599
The gathering of 
King Triton's daughters.

144
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,299
Minus one.

145
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,760
My father is going to kill me.
I'm sorry, Scuttle. Got to go.

146
00:13:25,853 --> 00:13:27,345
Yeah, yeah.
Alright, sweetie.

147
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,184
Me too.
Gotta get some air.

148
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:49,172
<i>Yes, hurry home, Princess.</i>

149
00:13:49,604 --> 00:13:51,939
<i>We wouldn't want to be late
for dad's gathering, now,</i>

150
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,426
<i>would we?</i>

151
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,402
Perhaps I'll join them.

152
00:13:56,734 --> 00:13:57,823
Wait.

153
00:13:58,055 --> 00:13:59,696
What a shame!

154
00:14:00,028 --> 00:14:01,772
It seems that big brother

155
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:05,167
forgot to invite Auntie 
Ursula to the party.

156
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:06,868
Again!

157
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,868
I should be the one
throwing the parties.

158
00:14:09,969 --> 00:14:12,745
Not waiting 
on an invitation.

159
00:14:14,786 --> 00:14:16,229
The feasts we had

160
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,111
when I lived at the palace.

161
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,001
And now,

162
00:14:23,102 --> 00:14:25,649
look at me, family pariah.

163
00:14:26,081 --> 00:14:29,516
Wasting away to 
practically nothing,

164
00:14:29,848 --> 00:14:31,455
banished and exiled,

165
00:14:31,556 --> 00:14:33,444
driven halfway to madness,

166
00:14:33,676 --> 00:14:38,767
in this dim little crevice 
for 15 long years!

167
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,899
While daddy and his
spoiled little

168
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,441
merbrats celebrate
the Coral Moon.

169
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,755
Well...

170
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,620
I'll give you something 
to celebrate.

171
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,599
I may have finally found

172
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,633
daddy's weakness.

173
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,634
Yes.

174
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,599
Red's fascination with 
humans might be just

175
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:07,117
the opening I've 
been waiting for.

176
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,593
It is irresponsible.

177
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,599
Your sisters are only here
for one phase

178
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,299
of the Coral Moon.
Can you imagine

179
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,325
- any one of them missing the gathering?
- No.

180
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,922
You're right. I'm sorry.

181
00:15:19,023 --> 00:15:20,332
It wasn't Ariel's fault.

182
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:23,015
We were exploring
and a shark...

183
00:15:23,116 --> 00:15:24,317
- chased us...
- Shark?

184
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,743
So you went to the
shipwrecks again.

185
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,792
Those waters are dangerous.

186
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:31,170
You don't have to
worry about me.

187
00:15:31,194 --> 00:15:32,674
Well, I do worry,
my little one.

188
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,499
I do worry. This obsession
with humans

189
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,499
- has to stop.
- I just want to know

190
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,131
- more about them.
- You know all you need to know.

191
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:40,499
I barely know anything.

192
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,200
You won't even let us
go to the surface.

193
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,372
Why do you have to be
so strong-minded,

194
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,300
- just like your mother?
- I am her daughter.

195
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,290
Yes. Foolish enough to be 
taken with the human world.

196
00:15:49,391 --> 00:15:50,935
If you would just try
to understand...

197
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:53,121
Oh, I have tried.
I have tried to understand you

198
00:15:53,222 --> 00:15:54,699
long enough, 
but as long as you

199
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,043
live in my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.

200
00:15:57,575 --> 00:15:59,142
Do you understand that?

201
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:14,399
Children.
You give them an inch,

202
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,099
they swim all over you.

203
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,517
Was I too hard on her?

204
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,599
Definitely not.
It's like I always say...

205
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:23,558
Children got to live 
by their parents' rules.

206
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,922
You are absolutely 
right, Sebastian.

207
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,113
My Ariel needs
constant supervision.

208
00:16:29,214 --> 00:16:30,216
Constant.

209
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,799
- Someone to watch over her.
- All the time,

210
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,699
- day and night.
- And you are just

211
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,776
- the crab to do that.
- I am just the crab to...

212
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,763
No, wait, that's not... what?
No, see,

213
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,001
I serve you, your Majesty,
as your honorable

214
00:16:41,102 --> 00:16:42,383
majordomo.

215
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,855
There is no better way
you can serve me, than

216
00:16:44,956 --> 00:16:47,339
to make sure my little one
stays out of trouble.

217
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,794
- But I...
- Yeah.

218
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,168
Go.

219
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,003
- Go.
- Yes, your Majesty.

220
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,735
How do i get myself into
these situations?

221
00:16:57,836 --> 00:16:59,369
I am an educated 
crustacean.

222
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,699
I got options. I don't need this.
I should be advising

223
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,058
the King, not chasing
after some headstrong

224
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:06,681
teenager.

225
00:17:40,602 --> 00:17:41,834
Ariel?

226
00:17:42,266 --> 00:17:43,020
Are you okay?

227
00:17:43,121 --> 00:17:44,721
He doesn't even hear me.

228
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,447
I am just not like him.
I don't see things the way he does.

229
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:52,041
And I...

230
00:17:52,373 --> 00:17:53,397
I don't see...

231
00:17:53,498 --> 00:17:55,179
how a world that makes...

232
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,530
such wonderful things,
can be so bad.

233
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,597

Let's go, gentlemen.

00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,076
But we want to dance!

300
00:23:28,177 --> 00:23:30,160
Come on, it's his birthday!

301
00:23:30,792 --> 00:23:32,310
Come on Grimsby!

302
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,131
What's wrong with me
having a little fun?

303
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,181
Everyone else is.

304
00:23:35,282 --> 00:23:37,317
You sire, are 
not everyone else.

305
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:39,881
It's time you separated yourself
from the rest of the crew.

306
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:40,699
But I am one of them!

307
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,373
And behave in a manner
more becoming of a future King.

308
00:23:45,527 --> 00:23:47,452
You mean be more
like my father was?

309
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:48,807
Cut off from the 
rest of the world?

310
00:23:49,106 --> 00:23:50,931
Eric, you know 
what I mean.

311
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,576
When you came to
us 21 years ago,

312
00:23:53,677 --> 00:23:55,073
the King and 
Queen took you in

313
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:57,263
and treated you 
as one of their own.

314
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,510
Now that you've 
come of age...

315
00:23:59,534 --> 00:24:00,536
Max...

316
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:01,956
Max!

317
00:24:02,388 --> 00:24:03,117
What are you doing over there?

318
00:24:03,218 --> 00:24:03,989
Come here boy!

319
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,202
Come on, let's go!

320
00:24:06,408 --> 00:24:07,000
Go on!

321
00:24:07,101 --> 00:24:08,864
Now that you've 
come of age,

322
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,639
your responsibilities
are at home.

323
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,599
Your father would 
have expected that.

324
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,979
Yes, trapped inside that castle
in isolation and fear.

325
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,800
I can't do it.

326
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,576
I believe a little fear
may be advisable, sire.

327
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,216
Grims, you're not listening.

328
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,499
I'm trying to be a 
different kind of leader.

329
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,146
That's the whole reason we're 
on this voyage, don't you see?

330
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,877
We have to stay open
to what's out here.

331
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:31,662
That's the only way 
our island can grow.

332
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,518
Eric, think what you risk.

333
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,219
I can't explain it, Grims.

334
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,601
It's in my blood.

335
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,554
Even now, I...

336
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,031
I feel there's something out here,
calling to me.

337
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,437
Storm coming in fast.

338
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,821
Storm coming in!

339
00:24:53,922 --> 00:24:55,144
All hands on deck!

340
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:56,552
All hands on deck!

341
00:24:56,653 --> 00:24:58,314
Tie down the 
hatches and crates!

342
00:24:58,415 --> 00:24:59,498
Yes sir.

343
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,199
Pull them up and stay 
on the main course!

344
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:18,853
We're on it, captain!

345
00:25:32,042 --> 00:25:32,799
Move on!

346
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,471
Move right now!

347
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,568
Go downstairs!

348
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,480
We have made contact!

349
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:10,256
Oil lamp!

350
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,455
Lifeboats! Abandon ship!

351
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:32,268
Abandon ship!

352
00:26:33,699 --> 00:26:35,697
Into the water boy!

353
00:26:35,798 --> 00:26:37,000
Go. Now.

354
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600

She was around

Yes, this must be it.

419
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:34,615

just a passing fad,

421
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:40,141

Isn't it beautiful?

427
00:33:52,423 --> 00:33:53,989
Look at the longing 
in his eyes.

428
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,359
What do you know 
about longing?

429
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,142
What is he doing here?

430
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,496
It's from the shipwreck.

431
00:33:58,597 --> 00:34:00,159
I found it at merman's reef.

432
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,380
I bet there's 
so much more.

433
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,659

434
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,814

436
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:09,959
You have to let go of this
obsession with humans.

437
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,159
I'm not obsessed.

00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,759

them as possible.

00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,159

444
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,279
You know why.

445
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,879
We don't have to 
be afraid of them.

446
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,179
I know that now.

447
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,586
Sebastian, if you had just
seen it up there,

448
00:34:27,687 --> 00:34:29,277

on the wind.

449

00:38:55,893 --> 00:38:59,235
Don't tell me Eric is still going on
about this girl who rescued him?

531
00:38:59,336 --> 00:39:00,440
I'm afraid so.

532
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,720
And the shipwreck, any casualties?

533
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:04,271
None, your Majesty.

534
00:39:04,503 --> 00:39:06,252
Well, thank goodness
no lives were lost.

535
00:39:06,353 --> 00:39:07,364
Indeed.

536
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,795
This restless nature of his,

537
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,157
it concerns me.

538
00:39:11,589 --> 00:39:13,720
Undertaking these
dangerous voyages.

539
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,159
Eric, sit.

540
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,980
Any sign of that girl yet,
Grimsby?

541
00:39:17,081 --> 00:39:18,351
Have some breakfast, please.

542
00:39:18,883 --> 00:39:20,244
We looked, sire,

543
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:21,643
but there was no girl.

544
00:39:22,424 --> 00:39:23,720
You were lucky to
have made it to shore

545
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:25,010
before you passed out.

546
00:39:25,142 --> 00:39:25,757
She was real.

547
00:39:25,858 --> 00:39:27,166
- She saved my life.
- Sit down, Eric.

548
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:29,364
- I'm not hungry, mother.
- I'm worried about you.

549
00:39:29,465 --> 00:39:30,967
You've not been yourself
since the shipwreck.

550
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:32,146
Have you checked the 
neighboring islands?

551
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,555
- Not all of them.
- Then I will.

552
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,795
No, you will not.

553
00:39:36,527 --> 00:39:38,601
You're not leaving this castle
until you're feeling better.

554
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:40,538
I'll feel better
when I finds her.

555
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:43,900
Do not think you're using this
girl as an excuse to run off again.

556
00:39:44,001 --> 00:39:46,866
Risking your life on some trade ship,
for the sheer adventure?

557
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,297
Sheer adventure?

558
00:39:48,829 --> 00:39:52,106
I'm trying to reach out to other cultures,
so we don't get left behind.

559
00:39:52,738 --> 00:39:56,406
Did you know on this last trip,
we traded alkane for 20 cases of quinine?

560
00:39:56,507 --> 00:39:58,029
They use it in Europe to
treat malaria.

561
00:39:58,053 --> 00:40:00,096
And where are those 
20 cases now?

562
00:40:00,428 --> 00:40:01,968
At the bottom of the sea.

563
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:05,059
How many shipwrecks have there been in
our waters this year, Prime Minister?

564
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,059
Six, your Majesty.

565
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,059
- Did you hear that, Eric?
- Of course, I did.

566
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,002
Shipwrecks, hurricanes.

567
00:40:10,103 --> 00:40:12,354
The sea gods are against us.

568
00:40:12,486 --> 00:40:14,177
How many times 
do I have to...?

569
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:21,900
They are eroding
our land from under us.

570
00:40:22,132 --> 00:40:24,035
Stealing it back 
into the ocean.

571
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:25,496
They would kill us 
all if they could.

572
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:26,559
That's ridiculous.

573
00:40:26,641 --> 00:40:27,724
Is it?

574
00:40:28,156 --> 00:40:31,418
May I remind you that a deadly 
shipwreck first brought you to us?

575
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:34,776
And now, I almost lost you
to one, the other day.

576
00:40:35,408 --> 00:40:36,914
We cannot keep 
tempting fate like this.

577
00:40:36,938 --> 00:40:38,897
- It has got to stop.
- What?

578
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,229
What does that mean?

579
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:41,958
It means that...

580
00:40:44,534 --> 00:40:46,879
that your responsibilities
are here now.

581
00:40:47,311 --> 00:40:48,078
So...

582
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:49,179
no more voyages.

583
00:40:49,256 --> 00:40:52,043
And no more chasing
after girls who don't exist.

611
00:44:04,798 --> 00:44:06,904
Ariel,
could you give me a hand?

612
00:44:10,704 --> 00:44:11,791
Ariel!

613
00:44:11,923 --> 00:44:14,247
Oh. Yes, of course.

614
00:44:16,678 --> 00:44:20,339
Do these humans have any idea
how much damage their shipwrecks do?

615
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,724
I don't think they intended
to have a shipwreck.

616
00:44:22,825 --> 00:44:24,588
They're careless, Ariel.

617
00:44:24,689 --> 00:44:27,409
It will take thousands of years 
for this coral to grow back.

618
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:29,763
And they have killed 
nearly all of the sea bed.

619
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:31,972
They'd kill us too
if they had the chance.

620
00:44:31,996 --> 00:44:34,229
No, no, they're 
not all like that.

621
00:44:34,861 --> 00:44:37,977
How would you know?
You've never even seen one.

622
00:44:38,209 --> 00:44:42,482
You were just a child when mother died and
father stopped us going to the surface.

623
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:46,657
I just mean we're not all the same, 
so why should humans be?

624
00:44:46,758 --> 00:44:48,679
What about humans?

625
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,039
I just mean...

626
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:51,912
Look at what that 
shipwreck did!

627
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:55,540
They got what 
they deserved.

628
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,196
They are the most
dangerous species of all.

629
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,028
Spoiling our waters,
destroying the reefs,

630
00:45:03,238 --> 00:45:07,251
having no respect over the
balance of the oceans.

631
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:11,501
They're not the only ones who have
no respect for balance.

632
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,570
Ariel, where are you...

633
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,139
What's going on with her?

634
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,041
Well, she's just at
that age when she

635
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,239
doesn't want to hang out 
with her older sisters anymore.

636
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:27,174
- Exactly. You remember what I was like.
- How could we forget?

637
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,776
Well, I wonder who
the lucky merman is.

638
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,194
The crab, your Majesty.

639
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:48,139
Come over here, Sebastian.

640
00:45:50,740 --> 00:45:54,239
Breathe, Sebastian. Remember,
guilty is as guilty acts.

641
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:57,711
Don't overreact.
Remain calm.

642
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,095
Yes...
Yes, your Majesty.

643
00:46:06,427 --> 00:46:12,598
Sebastian, have you noticed that 
Ariel has been acting peculiar lately?

644
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,507
Peculiar, sir?

645
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:21,706
Distracted, daydreaming, disappearing
for hours. You haven't noticed?

646
00:46:22,038 --> 00:46:24,082
Well I...

647
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:32,370
Actually, haven't. You know?
That is to say, I didn't...

648
00:46:35,361 --> 00:46:39,836
Sebastian, I know you've been 
keeping something from me.

649
00:46:39,968 --> 00:46:41,485
Keeping something?

650
00:46:43,016 --> 00:46:44,591
About Ariel.

651
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:45,930
Ariel?

652
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,875
Is my little one in love?

653
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,202
I tried to stop her, sir. I tried to stop 
her from going to the surface.

654
00:47:02,303 --> 00:47:04,017
I told her to stay
away from humans, but...

655
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,043
Humans!

656
00:47:05,684 --> 00:47:07,944
Humans?
Who said anything about humans?

657
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:13,633
Let's just drop these things
off and go back.

658
00:47:13,734 --> 00:47:14,563
No way.

659
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:16,504
With all that great 
stuff still down there?

660
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,979
Don't we have 
enough already?

661
00:47:18,311 --> 00:47:20,395
Come on, Flounder.
We're just getting started.

662
00:47:20,496 --> 00:47:21,820
So...

663
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,634
You broke the rules.

664
00:47:27,357 --> 00:47:29,791
You went to the above-world.

665
00:47:32,252 --> 00:47:33,978
There was a shipwreck.

666
00:47:34,896 --> 00:47:37,274
A man was drowning.
I had to save him.

667
00:47:37,706 --> 00:47:41,539
You should have let him drown.
They're savages.

668
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,387
You don't know that.

669
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:46,383
They killed your mother.

670
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:49,090
I know.

671
00:47:49,864 --> 00:47:52,579
But, one man did.

672
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,339
Why blame every human?
Mother wouldn't...

673
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,239
No, enough.
That's enough.

674
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,439
And Eric had nothing 
to do with it.

675
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:03,757
Eric?
Eric?

676
00:48:03,989 --> 00:48:06,039
Have you lost your
senses completely?

677
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,053
If you would've just 
heard him, father.

678
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:11,039
He's compassionate and kind.

679
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:13,588
He is a human.
You are a mermaid.

680
00:48:13,689 --> 00:48:15,531
Yes, but that doesn't
make us enemies.

681
00:48:15,632 --> 00:48:18,021
Promise me you will
never look for him again.

682
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,095
I can't.

683
00:48:19,196 --> 00:48:20,475
Promise me, Ariel.

684
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:22,607
I can't lie to you.
I won't.

685
00:48:22,708 --> 00:48:24,622
I swear I will get 
through to you.

686
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:27,807
No! Please.

687
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,157
Father, stop!

688
00:48:30,258 --> 00:48:32,025
This ends now.

689
00:48:34,014 --> 00:48:35,432
Please! Stop it!

690
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,220
It's for your own good.

691
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,296
Father, no!

692
00:48:49,690 --> 00:48:51,248
No...

693
00:49:01,098 --> 00:49:02,122
No.

694
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,102
Never leave again.

695
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,376
Ariel, I...

696
00:50:07,477 --> 00:50:09,045
Just go away.

697
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,140
Poor child.

698
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:31,881
Poor sweet child.

699
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:34,770
He can be so angry.

700
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,577
<i>He thinks he knows everything.</i>

701
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,741
Who are you?

702
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:43,739
You must not remember me.

703
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,592
I'm your auntie Ursula.

704
00:50:47,240 --> 00:50:48,339
The sea witch?

705
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,648
The what?

706
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:53,609
What has your father 
told you about me?

707
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,819
That you like to start trouble
between humans and merpeople.

708
00:50:59,951 --> 00:51:02,215
Is that what he said?

709
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:05,505
I'm not half the monster
he claims I am.

710
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,287
And I'm only here to help.

711
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:11,146
I don't need your help.

712
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:13,691
Whatever you 
say, darling.

713
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:21,399
- Wait!
- Yes?

714
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:26,117
How can you help me?

715
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,061
Ariel!

716
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:40,959
where is she going with those
slippery good-for-nothings?

717
00:51:41,091 --> 00:51:42,307
Let's go.

718
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,839
Come in.
Come in, child.

719
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:13,004
You mustn't lurk 
in passageways.

720
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,016
It's rude.

721
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,162
Forgive my aggressive garden.

722
00:53:18,263 --> 00:53:22,764
I wouldn't choose to live like this.
Believe me.

723
00:53:23,396 --> 00:53:25,803
Daddy's been so 
unfair to both of us.

724
00:53:25,904 --> 00:53:29,364
Controlling everything
we say and do.

725
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:34,105
In a way, we're the 
same, you and I.

726
00:53:35,316 --> 00:53:38,610
You don't seem at all 
like father described you.

727
00:53:38,711 --> 00:53:39,908
Is that right?

728
00:53:41,735 --> 00:53:43,365
We never did get along.

729
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:45,520
Squibling rivalry.

730
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,800
He always got what he want,
and what did I get?

731
00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:51,119
Nothing. Zip. Nada. Squat.

732
00:53:52,235 --> 00:53:53,959
Sound familiar, hon?

733
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:57,632
I know what you're going through.
Believe me.

734
00:53:57,940 --> 00:54:00,178
I know why you're here.

735
00:54:01,413 --> 00:54:02,647
I'm not sure I do.

736
00:54:02,748 --> 00:54:04,854
Oh, please.

737
00:54:04,955 --> 00:54:08,414
<i>I've been watching you
for a long time now, chérie.</i>

738
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:12,914
And what you really want is to be
up there, in the above-world.

739
00:54:13,246 --> 00:54:15,783
It's always had your curiosity.

740
00:54:16,015 --> 00:54:19,082
And now, it's got your heart.

741
00:54:19,414 --> 00:54:20,984
What do you mean?

742
00:54:22,024 --> 00:54:23,973
You're so young.

743
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:26,536
Don't you see?

744
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,916
You're meant
for each other.

745
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:33,579
And I can't bear to see 
you suffer like this.

746
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,182
As it happens, 
I can help you.

747
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:39,155
How?

748
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,829
The problem is simple.

749
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:46,458
You can't live in that
world, unless...

750
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,544
You become a 
human yourself.

751
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,611
Become human?

752
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:54,860
Is that even possible?

753
00:54:54,961 --> 00:54:57,190
My dear.

754
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,424
It's what I do.

755
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:03,798
It's what I live for.

756
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,868

783
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,414
So here's the deal.

784
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,339
I'll whip up a little potion to
make you human for three days.

785
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,442
You got that?

786
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,040
Three days.

787
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:50,921
Before the sun sets
on the third day,

788
00:56:51,022 --> 00:56:53,479
you and princie 
must share a kiss.

789
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,339
And not just any kiss.

790
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,067
A kiss of true love.

791
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,041
If you do, you will remain
human permanently.

792
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:06,079
But if you don't...

793
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,592
you'll turn back into
a mermaid...

794
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,139
And you belong to me.

795
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,336
No, Ariel!

796
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,431
You understand, of course,

797
00:57:17,532 --> 00:57:20,868
that you'll have to give up
your mermaid gifts.

798
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,755
You won't have this tail of yours,

799
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,291
hanging around, 
dragging you down.

800
00:57:25,740 --> 00:57:27,534
You won't be able to 
breathe underwater.

801
00:57:27,635 --> 00:57:28,954
Who needs it?

802
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:33,934
And you'll no longer have that
siren song of yours.

803
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:37,285
Because that wouldn't 
be fair now, would it?

804
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,232
Don't worry.

805
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:43,806
I'll keep it safe and 
soundness, here with me.

806
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:46,624
We got a deal?

807
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,700
I don't know.

808
00:57:51,232 --> 00:57:52,368
Well...

809
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,561
I may have just given you 
the premium package, kid.

810
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:57,105
Oh...

811
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:02,396
Life's full of tough 
choices, innit?

812
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:06,783
No.

813
00:58:07,015 --> 00:58:09,072
This is bad.
I can't do this.

814
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,139
Fine then. Forget 
about the world above.

815
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:15,539
Go back home to daddy.

816
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,394
And never leave again!

817
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,687

00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,304
Yes!

838
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:57,120
Yes!

839
01:00:01,740 --> 01:00:04,765
Look at her 
stupid little feet!

840
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,120
Oh, Ariel.

841
01:00:28,140 --> 01:00:29,289
Well?

842
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,613
Come on, girl.

843
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,398
It's either sink or swim.

844
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:45,098
Don't worry, boys.

845
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:49,300
She doesn't stand a
chance without this.

846
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,803
A mermaid without her voice.

847
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,545
And just in case, I slipped 
a little something extra

848
01:00:57,646 --> 01:00:59,795
into that spell of mine.

849
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,439
No matter how hard
that girl tries,

850
01:01:03,540 --> 01:01:07,474
she won't remember 
she needs to get that kiss.

851
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:10,296
Now it's just a
matter of time.

852
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,921
And then she's mine.

853
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,735
Not so easy 
without your tail, is it?

854
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,239
Keep going.

855
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:28,496
You just got to 
get your sea legs.

856
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:30,593
We're almost there.

857
01:01:39,740 --> 01:01:40,889
Get away from here!

858
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:43,508
Lord, have mercy.

859
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,699
Are you all right?

860
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:53,620
Poor girl, you must 
be in shock.

861
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,170
I'm going to find something 
to cover you up.

862
01:01:57,740 --> 01:02:00,865
Another shipwreck, 
Santa Maria.

863
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:23,796
Say, what's going on, kid?

864
01:02:23,928 --> 01:02:25,088
I thought you weren't
supposed to be up here.

865
01:02:25,112 --> 01:02:26,247
Now you're taking boat rides?

866
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:29,221
That, that rotten sea witch,
she stole Ariel's voice.

867
01:02:29,453 --> 01:02:30,532
Hey, Flounder.

868
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:31,664
What are you talking about?

869
01:02:31,727 --> 01:02:34,247
So Sebastian told Triton,
that Ariel saved a human.

870
01:02:34,302 --> 01:02:35,658
- And Triton got so mad.
- Okay, okay.

871
01:02:35,682 --> 01:02:37,247
Explanations later, man.

872
01:02:37,348 --> 01:02:38,141
We got to get 
you out of here.

873
01:02:38,242 --> 01:02:40,115
Wait, I didn't tell her
about the sea witch.

874
01:02:40,139 --> 01:02:40,680
Bye bye.

875
01:02:40,781 --> 01:02:43,154
And don't tell anyone
about the sea witch.

876
01:02:43,986 --> 01:02:46,902
Something about 
you seems different.

877
01:02:47,534 --> 01:02:48,839
Don't tell me.

878
01:02:48,940 --> 01:02:50,899
It's your hairdo, right?

879
01:02:51,031 --> 01:02:52,927
Because you have been using
the dinglehopper, no?

880
01:02:53,159 --> 01:02:56,425
I can't... I can't 
quite figure it out,

881
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:59,512
but I know that if I stand
here for long enough...

882
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:01,980
She got legs, ya idiot.

883
01:03:02,081 --> 01:03:03,698
You know, I, I...
We discussed this.

884
01:03:03,799 --> 01:03:05,339
I don't like it when
you call me an idiot.

885
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:06,764
Why don't you tell me
something nice.

886
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:08,786
"Hey, Scuttle,
your feathers look good."

887
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,042
Here you are.

888
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,936
It will have 
to do for now.

889
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,973
I'll take you 
to the castle.

890
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:17,256
They'll know what 
to do with you there.

891
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,339
Come on, in ya go.

892

What on earth?

908
01:04:22,753 --> 01:04:24,644
The girl got tangled in my net.

909
01:04:25,976 --> 01:04:27,970
- Is she all right?
- She will survive.

910
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:29,239
But she been through enough.

911
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,630
Won't say a word.

912
01:04:30,731 --> 01:04:32,277

Okay, up we go.

Can't speak at all?

930
01:05:16,131 --> 01:05:17,986
Can you blame her, Rosa?

931
01:05:18,087 --> 01:05:19,944
After all she 
has been through.

932
01:05:20,076 --> 01:05:22,149
It's a blessing she's 
not worse off.

933
01:05:22,381 --> 01:05:24,172
Such a far away 
look in her eyes.

934
01:05:24,404 --> 01:05:27,473

the single, most humiliating 
day of my life.

989
01:09:09,706 --> 01:09:11,192

990
01:09:11,424 --> 01:09:15,433
And then having to 
climb all the way up here.

991
01:09:15,534 --> 01:09:17,697
They couldn't give you a 
room on the ground floor?

992
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:23,573
I hope you appreciate what
I go through for you, young lady.

993
01:09:24,005 --> 01:09:26,630
No, don't ya turn 
your back on me.

994
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:27,933
What were you thinking?

995
01:09:28,034 --> 01:09:30,332
Choosing to give up your
mermaid gifts?

996
01:09:31,164 --> 01:09:33,887
Now, if we could just get 
that witch to give them back,

997
01:09:34,019 --> 01:09:36,537
then you could go home
and just be...

998
01:09:37,669 --> 01:09:39,564
And just be...

999
01:09:40,724 --> 01:09:44,203
Just be miserable for
the rest of your life.

1000
01:09:45,175 --> 01:09:48,312
Oh my, what a soft 
shell I am turning out to be.

1001
01:09:48,840 --> 01:09:52,860
All right, all right. 
I'll try to help you.

1002
01:09:53,192 --> 01:09:57,100
But we've got to be bold. Act
quickly, don't forget about the kiss.

1003
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,214
No, no, not me, the Prince!
You got to kiss the prince.

1004
01:10:01,315 --> 01:10:03,868
Don't you remember?
You only have three days to...

1005
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,266
Hello?

1006
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:10,993
Oh, no, she's put 
a spell on you.

1007
01:10:11,094 --> 01:10:12,900
You can't remember, can you?

1008
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,450
Now what are 
we going to do?

1009
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,802
Well, we got
no time to lose.

1010
01:10:17,903 --> 01:10:21,358
We just got to find a way to 
get the two of you together.

1011
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:28,881
You're hopeless,
child, you know that?

1012
01:10:30,504 --> 01:10:32,497
Completely hopeless.

1013
01:10:41,229 --> 01:10:43,518
A buffet.

1014
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:47,786
What? No nuts.

1015
01:10:47,887 --> 01:10:49,239
What are you doing here?

1016
01:10:49,340 --> 01:10:51,707
There you are, I've 
been looking for you.

1017
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:53,406
Flounder told me
the whole story.

1018
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,339
Has Ariel killed the Prince yet?

1019
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:58,717
Not "killed", "kissed",
ya bird brain.

1020
01:10:58,818 --> 01:11:00,107
And it's worse 
than we thought.

1021
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,039
The witch has 
placed a spell on her.

1022
01:11:02,140 --> 01:11:03,616
As soon as I tell her
she's got to kiss him,

1023
01:11:03,640 --> 01:11:06,107
the thought jumps clear 
right out of her head.

1024
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,619
So, now it's up to us.

1025
01:11:07,643 --> 01:11:08,996
To kiss the Prince?

1026
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:10,439
Forget it.

1027
01:11:10,540 --> 01:11:11,703
Where is Ariel now?

1028
01:11:11,804 --> 01:11:13,757
What do you mean?
She's right here.

1029
01:13:18,553 --> 01:13:20,540
What are you 
doing in here, child?

1030
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:23,493
You can't just go wandering 
around whereever ya please.

1031
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,439
Hide!

1032
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:25,825
Who is in here?

1033
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,686
Oh, it's you.

1034
01:13:41,474 --> 01:13:43,050
Nobody usually 
comes in here.

1035
01:13:46,940 --> 01:13:48,260
My little mermaid.

1036
01:13:50,040 --> 01:13:51,914
It's alright, it's alright.

1037
01:13:52,146 --> 01:13:53,187
You can look at her.

1038
01:13:53,740 --> 01:13:55,944
I found her on the
cost of Cartageña.

1039
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,357
Isn't she beautiful?

1040
01:14:01,540 --> 01:14:03,346
Oh, that's right. You...

1041
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,192
Well, it really 
doesn't matter.

1042
01:14:08,173 --> 01:14:09,361
Most people 
around here use

1043
01:14:09,385 --> 01:14:11,269
too many words and
have nothing to say.

1044
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:15,772
You know, I never 
believed all the lore

1045
01:14:15,920 --> 01:14:19,500
about mermaids luring
sailors to their deaths.

1046
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,527
Here, take her.

1047
01:14:24,740 --> 01:14:26,693
No, really,
I want you to have her.

1048
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,484
I'm running out 
of space as it is.

1049
01:14:30,440 --> 01:14:32,769
Nearly all of these things
come from my voyages.

1050
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:36,639
I know it must seem silly,
collecting all this stuff.

1051
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,595
But, just look at this 
fossilized seastone.

1052
01:14:39,696 --> 01:14:42,450
Can you believe such amazing 
things exist down there?

1053
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:47,260
No, wait!

1054
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,176
How did you know 
that was in there?

1055
01:14:59,062 --> 01:15:00,479
All this time?

1056
01:15:02,540 --> 01:15:03,829
It's incredible.

1057
01:15:05,340 --> 01:15:06,679
- Oh, that?
- Hey, girl.

1058
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:09,365
That, I just picked up from
the beach, here on the island.

1059
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,302
There's loads of them in
this time of year.

1060
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:21,760
I had no idea 
you could do that.

1061
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:25,151
Me?

1062
01:15:25,540 --> 01:15:27,890
No... really?

1063
01:15:28,122 --> 01:15:29,514
All right, then... 
And...

1064
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,842
How do I...?

1065
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:35,768
Yeah, that's it, 
that's it, girl.

1066
01:15:35,869 --> 01:15:38,439
Go get it,
go get it, I see you.

1067
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,036
Go on, come now...

1068
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:46,642
Alright.

1069
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:48,775
Yeah, well...

1070
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:50,895
I'll work on that.

1071
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:55,898
I love the people there.
Their culture, their custom.

1072
01:15:56,340 --> 01:15:59,173
This whole region is known
as the Brazilian Empire.

1073
01:15:59,473 --> 01:16:02,246
Then there is... 
Venezuela.

1074
01:16:03,721 --> 01:16:04,794
Colombia.

1075
01:16:06,040 --> 01:16:08,377
The area up here is 
called Mosquito Coast.

1076
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:13,533
Those waters are
all uncharted.

1077
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,305
Wouldn't it be amazing to discover some
place no one has ever seen before?

1078
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,368
But this...

1079
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:26,853
This was one of my
favorite voyages.

1080
01:16:27,540 --> 01:16:29,139
I bought that Peruvian rug there,

1081
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,480
along with six of the looms 
they used to make it.

1082
01:16:32,940 --> 01:16:34,633
Another one. All right.

1083
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:39,324
This is our Island.

1084
01:16:39,740 --> 01:16:41,522
We're in that very 
castle right now.

1085
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,637
Over here is our
main village.

1086
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:47,779
Our port there, was once
the busiest in the region.

1087
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:51,342
I'm hoping it will 
be again one day.

1088
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:56,166
And there's a beautiful lagoon, 
with a little waterfall right here.

1089
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:59,312
And then, all of 
that is rainforest.

1090
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:03,009
I can show you 
around, if you like.

1091
01:17:04,259 --> 01:17:05,261
All right.

1092
01:17:06,140 --> 01:17:07,140
We'll go tomorrow.

1093
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:08,139
But, sire...

1094
01:17:08,240 --> 01:17:09,800
Grimsby, good.

1095
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:12,716
We'll need a horse and carriage
ready for us in the morning.

1096
01:17:12,740 --> 01:17:14,713
May I have a 
quiet word, sire?

1097
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,204
Of course.

1098
01:17:20,840 --> 01:17:22,692
He's a special one, isn't he?

1099
01:17:22,793 --> 01:17:24,690
And that moonlight...

1100
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:30,701
We were going to send out all
the carriages tomorrow...

1101
01:17:30,802 --> 01:17:31,802
to look for the girl?

1102
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:32,862
The girl...

1103
01:17:33,070 --> 01:17:34,959
I wasn't thinking.
Of course. Yes.

1104
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:36,484
We must do 
that. Absolutely.

1105
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:38,317
And I must remind you, Eric,

1106
01:17:38,418 --> 01:17:41,136
what your mother said yesterday 
about you not leaving the castle.

1107
01:17:41,237 --> 01:17:43,642
- Until you're feeling better.
- Grimsby, I feel fine.

1108
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,328
I feel better than ever.

1109
01:17:46,340 --> 01:17:47,447
Yes.

1110
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,014
Yes, I can see that.

1111
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:54,915
I suppose we could
spare one carriage.

1112
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:21,400
Looks like you've 
made a friend there.

1113
01:18:21,540 --> 01:18:22,786
Come on, Max.

1114
01:18:23,118 --> 01:18:24,323
We'll see you later.

1115
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,539
Oh, no. You're not 
going without me.

1116
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:28,128
I only got two days left.

1117
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:29,796
I'm a crab 
on a mission.

1118
01:18:30,140 --> 01:18:31,388
Go ahead, jog.

1119
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,861
I'm getting
too old for this.

1120
01:18:38,140 --> 01:18:39,140
No, no, no, no.

1121
01:18:39,240 --> 01:18:40,980
Down, beast.

1122
01:18:45,740 --> 01:18:46,770
I still got it.

1123
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,550
Who is that riding out
with Prince Eric?

1124
01:18:53,740 --> 01:18:55,697
Is that the girl who 
washed up the other day?

1125
01:18:55,798 --> 01:18:57,216
Yes, it is, Lashana.

1126
01:18:58,140 --> 01:19:00,545
Didn't the Queen tell him
to stay in the castle?

1127
01:19:00,646 --> 01:19:02,148
Yes, she did, Lashana.

1128
01:19:02,249 --> 01:19:05,102
Aren't you getting into trouble 
for fetching him a carriage?

1129
01:19:05,234 --> 01:19:06,862
What carriage, Lashana?

1130
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:33,798
Do you want to try?

1131
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:35,952
Here.

1132
01:19:49,387 --> 01:19:51,011
Look out!
Look out!

1133
01:19:57,540 --> 01:19:59,074
Sorry about that.

1134
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:03,071
That was close.

1135
01:20:04,290 --> 01:20:05,292
Whoa!

1136
01:20:06,940 --> 01:20:08,060
Turn!

1137
01:20:25,040 --> 01:20:26,249
No!

1138
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:28,886
That was... fun.

1139
01:20:33,314 --> 01:20:34,741
Let me give 
you a hand.

1140
01:20:34,842 --> 01:20:35,931
Move, move.

1141
01:20:36,151 --> 01:20:36,706
Here we go.

1142
01:20:36,807 --> 01:20:37,959
This way, come on.

1143
01:20:38,391 --> 01:20:39,393
This way.

1144
01:20:40,324 --> 01:20:41,326
Here you go.

1145
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:43,187
That's it.

1146
01:20:44,191 --> 01:20:45,493
Thank you, lad.

1147
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:06,014
Island berry?

1148
01:21:06,240 --> 01:21:06,939
Like?

1149
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,121
It's pretty.

1150
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:10,848
Coconut.

1151
01:21:11,140 --> 01:21:12,509
Coconut.

1152
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,568
Fresh coconut?

1153
01:21:16,940 --> 01:21:18,732
No?
You don't want it?

1154
01:21:22,552 --> 01:21:23,346
Thank you, Miss.

1155
01:21:23,447 --> 01:21:25,405
Young lady, would 
you like to try some?

1156
01:21:28,587 --> 01:21:31,229
I think you'll 
be needing this.

1157
01:21:49,440 --> 01:21:51,192
Good day, sire.

1158
01:21:53,755 --> 01:21:55,313
Hat for the lady?

1159
01:21:57,740 --> 01:21:59,897
There you are.

1160
01:22:02,140 --> 01:22:03,420
No, no.

1161
01:22:03,521 --> 01:22:05,280
Too big,
try this.

1162
01:22:11,823 --> 01:22:13,709
Tropical flowers?

1163
01:22:52,040 --> 01:22:53,554
Everybody, everybody.

1164
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:02,143
Say, any kissing yet?

1165
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:06,140
No, when it comes to romance,
these two are slow as snails.

1166
01:23:06,540 --> 01:23:08,098
Hey, go find Flounder.

1167
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:10,339
We got to move this 
thing along, and quick.

1168
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,884
Okay, bossy.

1169
01:23:20,807 --> 01:23:22,907
Bring it here, bring it here,
bring it here now.

1170
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,070
Let it up, let 
it up, let it up.

1171
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:31,143
Come on now.

1172
01:23:47,640 --> 01:23:49,126
I love this time of night.

1173
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:54,520
Sometimes you'll see the eyes of 
a Screech owl, up in the tree.

1174
01:23:54,621 --> 01:23:57,423
Hey, hey, hey, 
come back with that.

1175
01:23:58,440 --> 01:23:59,442
Come on!

1176
01:24:02,840 --> 01:24:04,090
I think he 
went this way.

1177
01:24:04,240 --> 01:24:05,301
Are you alright?

1178
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,491
Hey, give me 
my hat back.

1179
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:15,995
All right.

1180
01:24:20,840 --> 01:24:22,312
I didn't want to lose this.

1181
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:41,239
Move your big fat feathers
bird, I can't see a thing.

1182
01:24:41,340 --> 01:24:42,676
Well, that worked 
pretty good, didn't it?

1183
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:43,817
But nothing is happening.

1184
01:24:43,955 --> 01:24:46,616
We're running out of time, and 
no one has puckered up once.

1185
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:51,124
I think it's time for a little
vocal romantic stimulation.

1186
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:53,790
Please, no.

1187
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:58,339
You gotta be bow-
chikka-wow-wow.

1188
01:24:58,440 --> 01:24:59,466
Chikka-wow!

1189
01:25:01,440 --> 01:25:04,210
- Wow-wow-wow.
- Alright... Gosh!

1190
01:25:04,311 --> 01:25:05,614
- I was off, I was off on that one.
- No...

1191
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:07,020
Let me find it.
Let me find it.

1192
01:25:07,044 --> 01:25:08,103
Wow...

1193
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:09,206
You're finished?

1194
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:10,031
Wow.

1195
01:25:10,132 --> 01:25:11,659
Alright, alright, listen...

1196
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:13,647
Ariel can not know
we are helping.

1197
01:25:13,779 --> 01:25:15,996
If she sees or hears us,
she'll shut us down.

1198
01:25:16,097 --> 01:25:18,539
Nah, man. We got to 
be sneaky about this.

1199
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,447
We got to work
on the prince

1200
01:25:20,640 --> 01:25:23,043
using the power 
of suggestion.

1201
01:25:23,175 --> 01:25:24,177
Good.

1202
01:25:24,335 --> 01:25:25,870
How are we going 
to do that?

1203
01:25:25,971 --> 01:25:28,572
We got to blend in with
the sounds of nature.

1204
01:25:28,673 --> 01:25:30,209
So she doesn't hear us.

1205
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:32,622
Percussion.

1206
01:25:38,740 --> 01:25:40,479
Strings.

1207
01:25:44,356 --> 01:25:45,871
Winds.

1208
01:25:50,921 --> 01:25:52,313
Words.

1209
01:25:52,745 --> 01:25:55,226
<i>♪ There, you see her</i>

1210
01:25:55,958 --> 01:25:58,449
<i>♪ Sitting there across the way</i>

1211
01:25:59,381 --> 01:26:01,600
<i>♪ She don't got a lot to say</i>

1212
01:26:01,701 --> 01:26:05,063
<i>♪ But there's something about her</i>

1213
01:26:06,389 --> 01:26:08,013
<i>♪ And you don't know why</i>

1214
01:26:08,114 --> 01:26:10,739
<i>♪ But you're dying to
try, you wanna...</i>

1215
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,447
<i>♪ Kiss the girl</i>

1216
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,972
<i>♪ Yes, you want her</i>

1217
01:26:19,640 --> 01:26:22,093
<i>♪ Look at her, you know you do</i>

1218
01:26:23,431 --> 01:26:25,389
<i>♪ Possibly, she wants you too</i>

1219
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:28,460
<i>♪ Use your words,
boy, and ask her</i>

1220
01:26:28,561 --> 01:26:29,563
Do you want to try?

1221
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:31,791
<i>♪ If the time is right</i>

1222
01:26:31,892 --> 01:26:33,778
<i>♪ And the time is tonight</i>

1223
01:26:33,879 --> 01:26:36,144

You can see Orion.

1235
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:13,426

1236

your name.

No.

01:28:14,640 --> 01:28:16,028
Ariel.

1256
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,179
That is a beautiful name.

God!

1291
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:00,539
That was close.

1292
01:30:00,640 --> 01:30:02,048
Too close.

1293
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:05,007
I don't get it.

1294
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,743
I didn't think that
little barracuda

1295
01:30:06,844 --> 01:30:08,936
stood a chance 
luring him in

1296
01:30:09,068 --> 01:30:10,523
without a voice.

1297
01:30:10,840 --> 01:30:12,662
How is that even possible?!

1298
01:30:13,540 --> 01:30:15,391
Well, we're not gonna 
let that happen again.

1299
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:20,174
It's time Ursula took matters 
into her own tentacles.

1300
01:30:20,406 --> 01:30:21,714
Where is it?

1301
01:30:21,946 --> 01:30:22,946
Come on.

1302
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:24,878
Come on, it's got to 
be here somewhere.

1303
01:30:25,410 --> 01:30:27,090
No, no!

1304
01:30:29,103 --> 01:30:31,325
Nobody ever puts my
things back!

1305
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,700
No, where is it?

1306
01:30:40,222 --> 01:30:41,681
No...

1307
01:30:44,065 --> 01:30:46,535
No, no, no.

1308
01:30:46,740 --> 01:30:50,219
No!

1309
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,023
Oh. There it is.
I got it.

1310
01:30:53,940 --> 01:30:56,808
That prince won't 
know what hit him.

1311
01:30:57,970 --> 01:31:00,814
Only one more sunset.

1312
01:31:01,146 --> 01:31:03,584
And then I'll make Triton writhe.

1313
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:09,592
I'll see him wriggle like 
a worm on a hook.

1314
01:31:18,390 --> 01:31:19,276
So where is she?

1315
01:31:19,377 --> 01:31:21,075
- We don't know, father.
- She's gone.

1316
01:31:21,407 --> 01:31:22,697
What do you 
mean she's gone?

1317
01:31:22,721 --> 01:31:24,081
We have been 
looking and looking.

1318
01:31:24,146 --> 01:31:25,283
There's no sign 
of her anywhere.

1319
01:31:25,307 --> 01:31:26,421
She is not in 
these waters.

1320
01:31:26,522 --> 01:31:27,602
Then, look again.

1321
01:31:27,683 --> 01:31:29,842
Search all of the seven seas,
if you have to.

1322
01:31:31,666 --> 01:31:34,602
- Ariel wouldn't dare go above...
- Don't even think of such a thing.

1323
01:31:35,134 --> 01:31:36,296
It doesn't make sense.

1324
01:31:36,397 --> 01:31:37,517
Why would she leave?

1325
01:31:38,049 --> 01:31:39,051
I have no idea.

1326
01:31:39,155 --> 01:31:41,765
Never mind that.
Just find her!

1327
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,564
What have I done?

1328
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,059
Everyone is asleep.

1329
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:24,198
- We should probably be quiet.
- ...in his room, all day?

1330
01:32:24,840 --> 01:32:26,029
Come on, come on, come on.

1331
01:32:26,130 --> 01:32:27,139
I imagine,

1332
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:28,375
he is resting.

1333
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:29,977
Has he been avoiding me?

1334
01:32:30,078 --> 01:32:31,441
No, your Majesty.

1335
01:32:31,542 --> 01:32:32,542
- No.
- No?

1336
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,642
No.

1337
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,239
You seem awfully certain.

1338
01:32:35,340 --> 01:32:37,524
Avoiding you doesn't 
seem like Eric, does it?

1339
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:42,060
Then where is he? He's not 
searching for his fantasy girl, I hope.

1340
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:46,447
No, your Majesty. That, I
I can say with certainty.

1341
01:32:46,548 --> 01:32:48,651
Thank heavens 
for small blessings.

1342
01:32:50,147 --> 01:32:50,751
It's wet.

1343
01:32:50,852 --> 01:32:55,463
I'll look into it. You really 
must get some rest yourself.

1344
01:32:55,564 --> 01:32:58,851
Yes, I suppose I should.
Thank you, Grimsby. Good night.

1345
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,739
Sorry about that.

1346
01:33:02,171 --> 01:33:04,643
I wasn't supposed to 
leave the castle today.

1347
01:33:04,959 --> 01:33:06,537
But I'm glad I did.

1348
01:33:08,720 --> 01:33:10,339
All these rules.

1349
01:33:11,682 --> 01:33:14,808
The truth is, I wasn't 
born into all this.

1350
01:33:14,909 --> 01:33:16,196
It all makes me 
feel a little uncom...

1351
01:33:16,220 --> 01:33:18,367
- Welcome back, sire.
- Grimsby.

1352
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:23,858
I trust you two have had
a pleasane outing.

1353
01:33:23,959 --> 01:33:26,917
Yes, we did. Didn't we?
Yes. Very nice.

1354
01:33:27,149 --> 01:33:28,686
You've had a long day,
Miss.

1355
01:33:28,787 --> 01:33:30,849
I imagine we should
let you get some sleep.

1356
01:33:31,481 --> 01:33:33,634
And perhaps dried off as well.

1357
01:33:34,400 --> 01:33:38,771
Yes, we took a rowboat out onto
the lagoon and I'm afraid we ended up in it.

1358
01:33:39,500 --> 01:33:41,967
Anyway, good night.

1359
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:52,417

1361
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:03,849
About the carriages, sire...

1362
01:34:04,380 --> 01:34:08,867
I'm afraid they didn't find
the mystery girl.

1363
01:34:09,680 --> 01:34:10,874
They didn't?

1364
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:19,232
May I then ask, should 
we continue the search?

1365
01:34:21,783 --> 01:34:23,193

My Goodness.

1431
01:39:19,359 --> 01:39:21,867
It is wonderful news
isn't it, Grimsby?

1432
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:22,845
Oh, yes.

1433
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:26,235
I must admit 
I was mistaken.

1434
01:39:26,580 --> 01:39:29,932
It seems you've really found
the girl of your dreams, after all.

1435
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:31,507
Yes.

1436
01:39:31,639 --> 01:39:33,209
Quite the surprise, Eric.

1437
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:35,500
What?

1438
01:39:35,601 --> 01:39:37,076
I know.

1439
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:39,767
I know it must seem fast,
but...

1440
01:39:39,899 --> 01:39:41,526
But I do owe her my life.

1441
01:39:41,958 --> 01:39:44,156
We will celebrate 
this evening.

1442
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:47,402
You shall introduce your 
intended to the court.

1443
01:39:47,534 --> 01:39:49,441
We can make that happen
can't we, Grimsby?

1444
01:39:49,573 --> 01:39:50,342
Yes.

1445
01:39:50,574 --> 01:39:52,409
If it's really what 
you want, Eric?

1446
01:39:53,980 --> 01:39:56,736
What I want?

1447
01:39:57,480 --> 01:39:58,667
It's...

1448
01:39:59,099 --> 01:40:00,931
It's what we both want.

1449
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,179
Lovely.

1450
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,341
Well, we've got our work 
cut out for us, have we?

1451
01:40:05,641 --> 01:40:06,460
Indeed.

1452
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:08,507
Then let's begin preparations.

1453
01:40:12,680 --> 01:40:16,120
Ariel, girl...
Where have you gone?

1454
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,320
Yeah, any sign of her?

1455
01:40:18,344 --> 01:40:20,846
No luck.
I flew over the village three times.

1456
01:40:20,980 --> 01:40:22,402
What?
Check the castle again.

1457
01:40:22,534 --> 01:40:23,559
It's almost sunset.

1458
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:24,879
We got to find her.

1459
01:40:24,980 --> 01:40:25,779
Copy that.

1460
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:27,779
What's wrong with that
fool prince?

1461
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:29,214
Something fishy 
is going on here.

1462
01:40:29,315 --> 01:40:31,156
- I don't like the smell in the air.
- Sebastian, over here.

1463
01:40:31,180 --> 01:40:32,180
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming.

1464
01:40:32,234 --> 01:40:33,236
Hold on.

1465
01:40:33,380 --> 01:40:34,297
Yes. What?

1466
01:40:34,398 --> 01:40:35,818
I think I know where Ariel is.

1467
01:40:36,180 --> 01:40:37,295
What are we waiting for?

1468
01:40:37,396 --> 01:40:39,115
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

1469
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:49,578
Ariel?

1470
01:41:22,268 --> 01:41:24,400
So long, Red.

1471
01:41:32,537 --> 01:41:33,682
Oh, no!

1472
01:42:00,354 --> 01:42:02,863
<i>♪ Risking it all</i>

1473
01:42:02,964 --> 01:42:09,217
<i>♪ Only to fall 
back where I started</i>

1474
01:42:09,318 --> 01:42:11,520
<i>♪ Back near the shore</i>

1475
01:42:11,621 --> 01:42:18,163
<i>♪ Back to before 
you took my hand</i>

1476
01:42:18,580 --> 01:42:20,475
<i>♪ Bet'cha on land...</i>

1477
01:42:20,576 --> 01:42:22,697
<i>♪ They understand</i>

1478
01:42:22,929 --> 01:42:25,336
<i>♪ And they don't strand you</i>

1479
01:42:25,437 --> 01:42:30,155
<i>♪ Brokenhearted</i>

1480

<i>♪ What did I give to live

1481
01:42:36,280 --> 01:42:43,281
<i>♪ Where do I go,
with nowhere to turn to?</i>

1482
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,806
What are you 
doing, child?

1483
01:42:51,238 --> 01:42:53,079
You can't give up
so easily.

1484
01:42:53,511 --> 01:42:56,237
This all has to be some 
sort of misunderstanding.

1485
01:42:56,669 --> 01:42:59,659
I've watched both of you. 
You're meant to be together.

1486
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:00,504
There you are.

1487
01:43:00,636 --> 01:43:01,670
I've been looking.

1488
01:43:01,771 --> 01:43:03,203
And I thought that
I had found you.

1489
01:43:03,227 --> 01:43:04,119
Because I heard.

1490
01:43:04,220 --> 01:43:05,619
But then I saw...

1491
01:43:05,751 --> 01:43:06,871
It... it wasn't you.

1492
01:43:06,972 --> 01:43:07,695
It was her.

1493
01:43:07,796 --> 01:43:09,540
But it wasn't, in the mirror.

1494
01:43:09,772 --> 01:43:11,468
Except she had... 
she had your voice.

1495
01:43:11,569 --> 01:43:12,992
What are you talking about?

1496
01:43:13,324 --> 01:43:15,129
Don't you get what
I'm telling you?

1497
01:43:15,230 --> 01:43:17,699
- No!
- The Prince has been tricked.

1498
01:43:17,931 --> 01:43:19,196
That lady who showed up,

1499
01:43:19,297 --> 01:43:21,456
is actually the sea 
witch in disguise.

1500
01:43:21,788 --> 01:43:22,909
Are you sure about this?

1501
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,371
Of course I'm sure!

1502
01:43:24,472 --> 01:43:25,769
Have I ever been wrong?

1503
01:43:25,870 --> 01:43:27,647
I mean, like, you know,
when it counts?

1504
01:43:27,779 --> 01:43:29,299
Well, what are 
we going to do?

1505
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:30,638
Well, we have 
to do something

1506
01:43:30,739 --> 01:43:33,496
before prince Eric ends 
up with that slimy squid.

1507
01:43:34,128 --> 01:43:35,723
Yes, girl, go!

1508
01:43:35,855 --> 01:43:38,055
Flounder, go tell the
Sea King what's happened.

1509
01:43:38,146 --> 01:43:39,463
He has to 
know everything.

1510
01:43:39,564 --> 01:43:40,231
Okay.

1511
01:43:40,332 --> 01:43:42,031
Well, well, wha... 
what do I do?

1512
01:43:42,132 --> 01:43:43,445
You give me a lift 
to the castle.

1513
01:43:44,180 --> 01:43:47,400
We got to find a way
to stop that engagement.

1514
01:43:56,180 --> 01:43:58,762
Heroism is too 
strong a word for it,

1515
01:43:59,780 --> 01:44:02,059
but I suppose 
I did save Eric.

1516
01:44:02,845 --> 01:44:04,491
It's what anyone 
would have done.

1517
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:05,474
Grimsby.

1518
01:44:05,575 --> 01:44:06,577
Sir?

1519
01:44:06,879 --> 01:44:07,978
Have you seen Ariel?

1520
01:44:08,180 --> 01:44:09,440
According to the servants...

1521
01:44:09,541 --> 01:44:10,995
she left the castle
early this morning.

1522
01:44:11,019 --> 01:44:12,021
Left?

1523
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:13,897
Can you blame her, Eric?

1524
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:16,736
I don't understand,
this is not like you.

1525
01:44:17,480 --> 01:44:19,346
I'm not sure I 
understand it myself.

1526
01:44:20,580 --> 01:44:21,997
I just wanted to...

1527
01:44:22,180 --> 01:44:23,583
- I thought...
- Eric?

1528
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,946
I don't really know 
what I wanted.

1529
01:44:39,180 --> 01:44:40,979
Almost there.

1530
01:44:41,080 --> 01:44:43,247
Now, when I 
give the signal,

1531
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,679
you drop me. 
Got it?

1532
01:44:45,780 --> 01:44:48,534
- Got it.
- No, you idiot!

1533
01:44:49,380 --> 01:44:51,001
I guess I'm 
on my own.

1534
01:44:54,180 --> 01:44:55,733
My darling...

1535
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,064
This, belonged to my mother.

1536
01:44:59,380 --> 01:45:01,207
And I'd like 
you to have it.

1537
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:05,567
Your happiness means
everything to me.

1538
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:09,459
Would you excuse me.

1539
01:45:15,230 --> 01:45:16,652
Enjoy yourself.

1540
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:21,078
Oh, Eric.

1541
01:45:21,210 --> 01:45:22,807
It's beautiful.

1542
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:27,180
The ring.

1543
01:45:27,218 --> 01:45:28,445
The ring, I lost it.

1544
01:45:29,077 --> 01:45:30,393
Has anybody 
seen the ring?

1545
01:45:30,625 --> 01:45:31,808
Have you 
seen the ring?

1546
01:45:32,780 --> 01:45:33,860
You've seen...

1547
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:38,283
Get away, 
you filthy bird!

1548
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:43,973
Help me!

1549
01:45:44,105 --> 01:45:45,778
I'm being attacked..

1550
01:45:48,180 --> 01:45:49,180
Ariel.

1551
01:45:49,212 --> 01:45:50,577
Ariel, I've been looking for you.

1552
01:45:50,678 --> 01:45:51,680
Who is that?

1553
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,603
What are you doing?

1554
01:45:55,780 --> 01:45:56,916
- Let me go.
- Sire!

1555
01:45:57,017 --> 01:46:00,107
Get away from me. 
She's insane!

1556
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:02,080
Ariel, stop!

1557
01:46:02,124 --> 01:46:03,284
Ariel.

1558
01:46:05,123 --> 01:46:06,315
Get off!

1559
01:46:38,106 --> 01:46:39,428
Ariel...

1560
01:46:40,380 --> 01:46:41,684
Yes.

1561
01:46:43,034 --> 01:46:44,424
It was you all along.

1562
01:46:45,780 --> 01:46:47,272
I should have known.

1563
01:46:48,980 --> 01:46:50,603
I don't know what 
came over me.

1564
01:46:50,935 --> 01:46:52,079
She bewitched you.

1565
01:46:52,180 --> 01:46:53,464
Get away from her!

1566
01:46:53,565 --> 01:46:54,833
Eric, I want you to know...

1567
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,098
Just kiss!

1568
01:46:56,199 --> 01:46:58,314
- I want you to know everything...
- Nothing matters now.

1569
01:47:00,580 --> 01:47:01,897
No!

1570
01:47:15,680 --> 01:47:18,354
Oh, my God!
She's a sea creature.

1571
01:47:19,280 --> 01:47:21,239
You're too late!

1572
01:47:22,880 --> 01:47:25,419
You're too late!

1573
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,280
Stay back.

1574
01:47:36,328 --> 01:47:37,621
Shut up!

1575
01:47:39,780 --> 01:47:40,947
Eric!

1576
01:47:48,080 --> 01:47:49,082
Eric.

1577
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,079
No. This is the work of
the sea gods.

1578
01:47:51,180 --> 01:47:51,935
I warned you.

1579
01:47:52,080 --> 01:47:53,542
Their whole world is evil.

1580
01:47:53,674 --> 01:47:56,282
Eric, wait.
Eric.

1581
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:01,679
What are you doing?
Let go of me.

1582
01:48:01,780 --> 01:48:02,579
Not a chance!

1583
01:48:02,680 --> 01:48:04,279
You made a deal, remember?

1584
01:48:04,380 --> 01:48:05,754
Three days, no kiss?

1585
01:48:07,080 --> 01:48:08,932
Yeah, is it all coming 
back to you?

1586
01:48:10,580 --> 01:48:11,763
I thought so.

1587
01:48:12,080 --> 01:48:14,440
Well, now you gotta 
live with it, toots.

1588
01:48:26,650 --> 01:48:29,368
Ursula!

1589
01:48:29,680 --> 01:48:32,101
Let her go.

1590
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:33,958
Forget it big brother.

1591
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:36,843
She belongs to me now.

1592
01:48:41,180 --> 01:48:42,662
You see?

1593
01:48:43,094 --> 01:48:44,638
We made a deal.

1594
01:48:44,970 --> 01:48:46,179
In blood.

1595
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:47,666
It's unbreakable.

1596
01:48:47,980 --> 01:48:49,465
Even for you.

1597
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:51,975
I'm sorry, father.
This is all my fault.

1598
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,939
What do you want 
with my daughter?

1599
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:56,460
Nothing.

1600
01:48:57,092 --> 01:48:58,626
It's you I want.

1601
01:48:59,058 --> 01:49:00,818
I want to 
see you suffer.

1602
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:03,038
Like I have suffered
all these years.

1603
01:49:03,870 --> 01:49:07,035
And a daughter of the great
Sea King...

1604
01:49:07,467 --> 01:49:10,167
is a very precious commodity.

1605
01:49:10,680 --> 01:49:13,187
Poor unfortunate soul.

1606
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:15,561
Hey!
Get her, boys!

1607
01:49:18,143 --> 01:49:19,143
No...

1608
01:49:20,299 --> 01:49:21,692
I wouldn't.

1609
01:49:23,601 --> 01:49:25,162
Shocking, isn't it?

1610
01:49:26,380 --> 01:49:27,979
Of course, I 
always was a gal

1611
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:29,903
with an eye 
for a bargain.

1612
01:49:30,380 --> 01:49:32,747
What do you 
say to a trade?

1613
01:49:33,880 --> 01:49:36,578
What's your precious 
little Ariel worth to you?

1614
01:49:50,480 --> 01:49:52,578
It's mine now.

1615
01:49:59,047 --> 01:50:00,143
No!

1616
01:50:02,581 --> 01:50:03,980
Father!

1617
01:50:21,744 --> 01:50:23,507
You monster!

1618
01:50:25,036 --> 01:50:27,071
Don't be a fool, 
ya little brat!

1619
01:50:27,946 --> 01:50:30,149
You are powerless 
against me...

1620
01:50:31,880 --> 01:50:33,742
You will pay for that.

1621
01:50:34,280 --> 01:50:35,595
Get him!

1622
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:46,975
Say goodbye to your 
human heartthrob.

1623
01:50:47,274 --> 01:50:48,276
No!

1624
01:50:51,980 --> 01:50:53,466
My babies!

1625
01:51:21,378 --> 01:51:22,490
Eric.

1626
01:51:28,680 --> 01:51:30,480
Get to shore. She'll kill you.

1627
01:51:30,812 --> 01:51:32,079
I'm not leaving you.

1628
01:51:44,980 --> 01:51:47,496
Yes!

1629
01:51:48,080 --> 01:51:49,431
Give me your hand.

1630
01:51:53,430 --> 01:51:54,593
Now!

1631
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:06,163
Look out!

1632
01:52:09,980 --> 01:52:14,781
Now I rule the seas
and all will be helpless

1633
01:52:14,882 --> 01:52:17,132
under my power!

1634
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:22,882
No.

1635
01:52:23,580 --> 01:52:27,104
So much for true love.

1636
01:53:30,660 --> 01:53:33,124
So long, lover boy.

1637
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:43,527
No!

1638
01:56:15,680 --> 01:56:17,891
You gave your 
life for me.

1639
01:56:20,980 --> 01:56:23,921
And you fought to
get my life back.

1640
01:56:26,964 --> 01:56:29,261
I didn't fight alone, father.

1641
01:56:30,280 --> 01:56:32,465
Eric was with me.

1642
01:56:36,080 --> 01:56:38,472
All that matters now
is that you are safe,

1643
01:56:39,004 --> 01:56:40,330
and home.

1644
01:56:41,662 --> 01:56:43,403
Where you belong.

1645
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:17,979
Sire, please.

1646
01:57:18,080 --> 01:57:19,225
We need a boat.

1647
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:20,865
We have to find her!

1648
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,950
And then what?

1649
01:57:27,676 --> 01:57:31,145
And then what, Eric?

1650
01:57:33,280 --> 01:57:37,551
- Son.
- You were right.

1651
01:57:39,308 --> 01:57:40,913
I was chasing
after a fantasy girl.

1652
01:57:40,937 --> 01:57:41,937
No.

1653
01:57:41,980 --> 01:57:44,153
No, I was wrong.

1654
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,002
She was very real.

1655
01:57:46,680 --> 01:57:48,243
And so were your
feelings for her.

1656
01:57:48,267 --> 01:57:49,708
I see that now.

1657
01:57:50,480 --> 01:57:52,223
It's just that...

1658
01:57:54,180 --> 01:57:56,886
Our worlds were never
meant to be together.

1659
01:58:43,385 --> 01:58:44,721
Sebastian!

1660
01:58:49,391 --> 01:58:51,256
You got to be kidding me.

1661
01:59:04,820 --> 01:59:06,641
Yes, your Majesty?

1662
01:59:08,060 --> 01:59:11,394
I have always tried to do
what's best for our people.

1663
01:59:11,960 --> 01:59:13,963
Yes, your Majesty.

1664
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:16,640
And what is best
for my daughters.

1665
01:59:16,772 --> 01:59:18,992
Indeed, your Majesty.

1666
01:59:19,740 --> 01:59:24,516
And I've done everything in my 
power to make her happy.

1667
01:59:26,858 --> 01:59:29,475
Well, not quite...

1668
01:59:38,120 --> 01:59:41,257
She wants a different life, 
than I had planned for her.

1669
01:59:41,358 --> 01:59:44,281
She did try to tell you,
your Majesty.

1670
01:59:45,760 --> 01:59:48,482
But I won't be able to 
protect her anymore.

1671
01:59:48,583 --> 01:59:50,850
Well, it's like 
I always say...

1672
01:59:50,951 --> 01:59:54,055
Children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

1673
01:59:54,156 --> 01:59:55,794
Oh, is that what 
you always say?

1674
01:59:55,895 --> 01:59:57,299
Something like that, yes.

1675
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:03,370
Then there's just
one problem left.

1676
02:00:03,602 --> 02:00:05,851
And what's that, 
your Majesty?

1677
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:09,839
How much I am going 
to miss my little one.

1678
02:00:41,883 --> 02:00:43,842
Good boy. Come on.

1679
02:00:54,860 --> 02:00:55,949
Again?

1680
02:01:09,860 --> 02:01:10,935
Max?

1681
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:14,692
What's all this, Grims?

1682
02:02:14,793 --> 02:02:18,501
The Queen wanted the two of you
to have a proper send-off, sire.

1683
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:22,782
-Thank you, your Majesty.
- No. Thank you.

1684
02:02:23,100 --> 02:02:27,005
Much as I hate farewells,
we still have cause to celebrate.

1685
02:02:27,637 --> 02:02:31,543
Our worlds have misunderstood
one another for far too long.

1686
02:02:31,900 --> 02:02:34,934
Your marriage marks a
new beginning for us.

1687
02:02:35,266 --> 02:02:37,571
Yes, a beginning.

1688
02:02:38,100 --> 02:02:40,799
Now, get out there.

1689
02:02:41,300 --> 02:02:42,499
Change the world.

1690
02:02:42,600 --> 02:02:45,497
Or whatever it is you have to do,
so we don't get left behind.

1691
02:02:45,900 --> 02:02:47,333
That doesn't sound 
like my mother.

1692
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:48,701
What have you 
done with her?!

1693
02:02:49,800 --> 02:02:51,186
Off you go.

1694
02:02:52,300 --> 02:02:55,027
Have you decided where
you're headed first?

1695
02:02:56,200 --> 02:02:58,751
- To uncharted waters!
- Okay.

1696
02:02:58,852 --> 02:03:00,906
A mermaid and a man...

1697
02:03:01,138 --> 02:03:02,975
Whoever would've imagined.

1698
02:03:06,900 --> 02:03:08,953
Well, look who's here.

1699
02:03:09,085 --> 02:03:11,217
- We got you something, Ariel.
- We sure did.

1700
02:03:11,318 --> 02:03:12,921
Something you almost lost.

1701
02:03:13,022 --> 02:03:14,124
Wha... Where is it?

1702
02:03:14,225 --> 02:03:15,861
You're sitting on it, bird.

1703
02:03:18,900 --> 02:03:20,523
My little mermaid.

1704
02:03:23,300 --> 02:03:24,520
Keep her for me.

1705
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:27,499
I hope she causes you
less trouble than I did.

1706
02:03:27,600 --> 02:03:30,020
I was right about the 
dinglehopper, wasn't I?

1707
02:03:30,352 --> 02:03:32,552
Yes, you were, Scuttle.
You were.

1708
02:03:32,700 --> 02:03:35,599
You won't be gone too 
long, will you, Ariel?

1709
02:03:35,700 --> 02:03:36,700
Of course not.

1710
02:03:36,754 --> 02:03:38,794
I'll be back by the 
next Coral Moon.

1711
02:03:39,200 --> 02:03:41,400
Yeah, don't be 
late this time.

1712
02:04:02,300 --> 02:04:03,366
You ready?

1713
02:04:06,400 --> 02:04:07,405
Yes.

1714
02:04:08,300 --> 02:04:09,568
Yes, I'm ready.

1715
02:04:49,800 --> 02:04:51,235
My child.

1716
02:04:56,400 --> 02:04:57,591
Eric?

1717
02:05:01,800 --> 02:05:04,027
Thank you for hearing me.

1718
02:05:05,500 --> 02:05:08,281
You shouldn't have had to
give up your voice to be heard.

1719
02:05:09,200 --> 02:05:11,110
But now I am listening.

1720
02:05:13,200 --> 02:05:15,738
And I will always 
be here for you.

1721
02:05:17,000 --> 02:05:18,345
We all will.

1722
02:06:02,700 --> 02:06:04,472
I love you, father.
