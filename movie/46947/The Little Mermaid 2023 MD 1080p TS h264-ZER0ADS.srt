Thank you.

6
00:01:47,923 --> 00:01:49,923
- Aim somewhere else.
- Over there!

7
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:51,880
- That's right.
- [EVERYONE] Awh!

8
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,137
More harpoons!

9
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,621
Ready the nets, mate!

10
00:01:54,645 --> 00:01:56,998
Hoist and kill her
before she comes aboard!

11
00:01:57,022 --> 00:01:58,548
- Let me see, let me see!

12
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:00,698
Wait, wait, wait!

13
00:02:01,201 --> 00:02:03,618
- [EVERYONE] Awh!
- She's a fast one!

14
00:02:03,642 --> 00:02:06,194
- Hand me another!
- She's getting away!

15
00:02:06,218 --> 00:02:07,664
- From this angle.
- Not even...

16
00:02:07,688 --> 00:02:09,328
- Release!
- Again, captain?

17
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:11,268
- [EVERYONE] Awh!
- We missed her.

18
00:02:12,938 --> 00:02:15,465
No, Sullivan.

19
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:16,482
Wayne, quickly.

20
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:18,199
- She's right there.
- Hey, hey!
- Ace in one.

21
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,012
- Move, move! Get back!
- Why test the line...?

22
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:21,556
- My turn!
- What are you doing?!

23
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,329
- It's a mermaid!
- A mermaid?!

24
00:02:23,353 --> 00:02:25,239
Use your eyes!

25
00:02:25,716 --> 00:02:27,389
- Where is she?
- Look, there.

26
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,019
What were you thinking?!

27
00:02:29,043 --> 00:02:32,429
- These are dangerous waters.
- And this is a dangerous time.

28
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:34,279
Tonight's the Coral Moon.

29
00:02:34,303 --> 00:02:36,026
They say, this is when the Sea King

30
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,350
calls his mermaid daughters together

31
00:02:38,374 --> 00:02:39,903
to lure men to their deaths.

32
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,357
- Is that what they say?
- Aye!

33
00:02:41,382 --> 00:02:44,039
Not even the strongest
can resist their spell.

34
00:02:44,064 --> 00:02:45,437
Just an old lore.

35
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:52,089
Back to work!

36
00:02:52,113 --> 00:02:53,046
- Alright.
- Come on, lads.

37
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,510
- See there?
- See what, Hawkins?

38
00:02:55,534 --> 00:02:58,367
Crosswind gust kicked up the top,
that's all.

39
00:02:58,391 --> 00:03:00,260
That's the Sea King's doing.

40
00:03:00,284 --> 00:03:03,571
He'd pull us under himself,
if he could!

41
00:03:03,595 --> 00:03:06,628
- Raise the main!
- The blindsight?

42
00:03:06,652 --> 00:03:08,105
Where's Prince Eric?

43
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:11,152
Up on the bow, Sir Grimsby.

44
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:17,046
Eric!

45
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,060
What are you doing up there?!

46
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:20,931
Get back here at once!

47
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:24,411
You ought to stop worrying
so much about me, Grimsby!

48
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:25,695
Call me selfish,

49
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,901
but I do not want to tell the Queen

50
00:03:27,925 --> 00:03:30,825
that her son fell overboard on my watch.

51
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,147
And on his birthday,
of all days.

52
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,878
- Pull!
- Let it out, let it out.

53
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:36,742
Looks like there's
a Spanish galleon out there,

54
00:03:36,767 --> 00:03:38,488
headed toward the mainland.

55
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:41,873
We could follow it to port,
see what they've brought to trade.

56
00:03:41,897 --> 00:03:44,730
Our ship is loaded
to the gills as it is.

57
00:03:44,754 --> 00:03:48,194
We've risked our necks out
here for seven weeks already.

58
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:50,778
We're going home tonight.

59
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:53,798
Eric, pay attention.

60
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:55,642
I need you to be more careful.

61
00:05:55,532 --> 00:05:58,338
My daughters of the seven seas,

62
00:05:58,362 --> 00:06:01,784
I welcome news from all of your waters.

63
00:06:01,808 --> 00:06:04,154
Tamika, Perla...

64
00:06:04,179 --> 00:06:07,334
It's so good to see you.

65
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:09,926
Caspia, Indira...

66
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:13,323
It fills my heart to
have you all here.

67
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:16,587
Mala, Karina.

68
00:06:21,357 --> 00:06:23,357
Where is Ariel?

69
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:28,600
Sebastian...

70
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:32,525
You were supposed to see to it
that Ariel was here.

71
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,091
Oh...
I tried, your Majesty.

72
00:06:35,115 --> 00:06:37,605
But that child,
she is impossible.

73
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:41,602
I reminded her about the gathering,
just this morning.

74
00:06:41,626 --> 00:06:45,232
What more can one crustacean do?

75
00:06:45,256 --> 00:06:47,449
You can go find her.

76
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:51,512
Yes, your Majesty.
Right away.

77
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,049
Yes, your Majesty.
Right away, your Majesty.

78
00:06:54,073 --> 00:06:56,832
How hard can it be
to find a mermaid, after all?

79
00:06:56,856 --> 00:07:00,296
If I'm lucky,
I'll only have to search one ocean.

80
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,933
Where are you, child?

81
00:07:28,337 --> 00:07:31,336
We aren't supposed to be
this far from the palace, Ariel.

82
00:07:31,361 --> 00:07:32,163
Let's go back.

83
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,534
Oh, how does that work?

84
00:07:34,559 --> 00:07:35,738
Come on, Ariel.

85
00:07:35,763 --> 00:07:36,763
Please?

86
00:07:36,787 --> 00:07:39,729
Oh, Flounder.
Stop being such a guppy.

87
00:07:39,754 --> 00:07:41,644
I'm not a guppy.

88
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:52,039
I think we've gone far enough.

89
00:07:54,851 --> 00:07:57,551
Wait, what is that?

90
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,883
I've never seen that one.

91
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:02,575
Come on!

92
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,256
Ariel, wait for me!

93
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,137
You know I can't swim that fast.

94
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,240
Whoa, look at all that.

95
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:32,428
They must have used this ship
for battles or something.

96
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,319
Yeah, great.

97
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,294
Now let's get out of here.

98
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:38,647
- Getting cold fins?
- Who, me?

99
00:08:38,672 --> 00:08:40,706
No way.
Good.

100
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:43,783
Then you can stay out here
and watch for sharks.

101
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:46,183
Alright, good.

102
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,097
What?

103
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,048
Ariel, wait!

104
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:05,889
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

105
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:07,414
Oh, Flounder.

106
00:09:10,938 --> 00:09:13,280
- Look at this.
- Whoa.

107
00:09:13,305 --> 00:09:16,827
It's the smallest trident I've ever seen.

108
00:09:17,785 --> 00:09:22,353
I'm King Flounder,
lord of the seven seas.

109
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:25,136
I wonder why a human
would need one that size.

110
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:26,788
I bet Scuttle will know.

111
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:29,415
She always does.

112
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,391
Will you relax?

113
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:34,779
It's just a reflection.

114
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:36,405
Calm down.

115
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,051
Nothing is going to happen.

116
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,795
- Flounder, look out!
- Aah!

117
00:10:15,787 --> 00:10:16,834
Flounder!

118
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:04,000
You okay, Flounder?

119
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,832
Sure, I mean...

120
00:11:05,856 --> 00:11:07,867
I've seen bigger sharks, just...

121
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:10,721
You know, you can't back down.
You gotta show 'em who's in charge.

122
00:11:13,001 --> 00:11:16,398
Come back, Flounder.
It's just Scuttle.

123
00:11:23,901 --> 00:11:26,914
Ariel!
Hey, kid, how you doing?

124
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:29,000
Don't mind me,
I was just grabbing a snack.

125
00:11:29,001 --> 00:11:30,667
Scuttle,
we found more treasure.

126
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:31,285
Yeah.

127
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:34,267
We went into this sunken ship,
and it was really creepy.

128
00:11:34,292 --> 00:11:36,188
Human stuff.
A-ha.

129
00:11:36,213 --> 00:11:38,660
Alright, alright.
Let me see, let me see.

130
00:11:38,685 --> 00:11:40,025
Any idea what this is?

131
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,000
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

132
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,343
Wow.

133
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:44,514
This...

134
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,014
This is, yeah...

135
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,855
This is very, very unusual.

136
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,867
What, what is it?

137
00:11:48,892 --> 00:11:50,350
It's a...

138
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,150
It's a dinglehopper.

139
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:53,709
- Dinglehopper?
- Yeah, yeah.

140
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:57,629
Humans use these babies
to style their hair.

141
00:11:57,654 --> 00:11:59,189
You just, give it a little twirl,

142
00:11:59,214 --> 00:12:01,669
a little yanking,
might get some pieces with it.

143
00:12:01,694 --> 00:12:03,735
And you're left with
an artistically pleasing

144
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,342
conflagration of hair
that humans go nuts for.

145
00:12:06,367 --> 00:12:08,556
Really?
I would love to see that.

146
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:10,162
- Can't!
- Flounder!

147
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:11,587
You know it's true.

148
00:12:11,612 --> 00:12:13,787
Your father still won't let
you go to the surface, huh?

149
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:15,054
No, it's forbidden.

150
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:17,660
He thinks all humans are, barbarians.

151
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:19,946
No...
They're not so bad.

152
00:12:19,971 --> 00:12:21,753
Unless you're a coconut.

153
00:12:21,778 --> 00:12:23,123
They hate coconuts.

154
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:24,449
I swear, they get a hold of one,

155
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:27,495
they smash it to pieces, just like that...
It's weird.

156
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,205
- And what's this?
- Ariel!

157
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:31,251
Spreading across a whole ocean
looking for this child.

158
00:12:31,276 --> 00:12:33,189
Ariel!
Ow!

159
00:12:33,214 --> 00:12:34,214
Sebastian!

160
00:12:34,239 --> 00:12:35,565
Sorry about that!

161
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,255
Ariel!
What are you doing up there?

162
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,326
Wasting your time with this no-nothing bird

163
00:12:40,351 --> 00:12:42,888
- that can't tell swimming from flying.
- Hey!

164
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:47,035
I suppose you've completely
forgotten tonight's the Coral Moon.

165
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,457
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.

166
00:12:49,482 --> 00:12:51,723
The gathering of King Triton's daughters.

167
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:53,175
Minus one.

168
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,889
My father's gonna kill me.

169
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,534
- Sorry, Scuttle. Gotta go.
- Yeah, yeah.

170
00:12:56,559 --> 00:13:00,154
Alright, sweetie.
Me too, gotta get some air.

171
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:19,520
Yes, hurry home, Princess.

172
00:13:19,545 --> 00:13:24,411
We wouldn't want to be late for
daddy's gathering, now, would we?

173
00:13:24,436 --> 00:13:26,597
Perhaps, I'll join them.

174
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:27,848
Oh, wait...

175
00:13:27,873 --> 00:13:29,908
What a shame.
It...

176
00:13:29,933 --> 00:13:35,301
It seems that big brother forgot
to invite Auntie Ursula to the party.

177
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:37,108
Again!

178
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,121
Oh...

179
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:43,054
I should be the one throwing the parties
and not waiting on an invitation.

180
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:47,913
Oh, the feasts we had
when I lived in the palace.

181
00:13:52,196 --> 00:13:55,947
And now, look at me,
family pariah,

182
00:13:55,971 --> 00:13:59,682
wasting away to
practically nothing.

183
00:13:59,707 --> 00:14:03,499
Banished and exiled,
driven halfway to madness...

184
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:09,315
in this dim little crevice
for 15 long years.

185
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:17,128
While daddy and his spoiled little
merbrats celebrate the Coral Moon.

186
00:14:17,153 --> 00:14:18,948
Well...

187
00:14:18,972 --> 00:14:21,980
I'll give them
something to celebrate.

188
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:27,000
I may have finally found daddy's weakness.

189
00:14:27,001 --> 00:14:29,227
Yes.

190
00:14:29,252 --> 00:14:36,891
Red's fascination with humans might
be just the opening I've been waiting for.

191
00:14:38,731 --> 00:14:40,581
It is irresponsible.

192
00:14:40,606 --> 00:14:43,654
Your sisters are only here
for one phase of the Coral Moon.

193
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:45,876
Can you imagine any one of
them missing the gathering?

194
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:48,000
No, you're right.

195
00:14:48,001 --> 00:14:50,361
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't Ariel's fault.

196
00:14:50,386 --> 00:14:52,319
We, we were,
we were exploring...

197
00:14:52,344 --> 00:14:54,685
- and a shark chased us.
- Shark?

198
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:57,686
So you went to the shipwrecks again.

199
00:14:57,711 --> 00:14:59,746
Those waters are dangerous.

200
00:14:59,771 --> 00:15:01,111
You don't have
to worry about me.

201
00:15:01,136 --> 00:15:03,501
Well, I do worry, my little one.
I do worry.

202
00:15:03,526 --> 00:15:05,604
This obsession with humans has to stop.

203
00:15:05,629 --> 00:15:07,866
I just want to know more about them.

204
00:15:07,891 --> 00:15:10,509
- You know all you need to know.
- I barely know anything.

205
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,235
You won't even let us go to the surface.

206
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,388
Why do you have to be
so strong-minded, just like your mother.

207
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:16,922
- I am her daughter.
- Yes...

208
00:15:16,947 --> 00:15:19,261
Foolish enough to be taken
with the human world.

209
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:21,841
- If you would just try to understand.
- I have tried.

210
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,932
I have tried to understand you long enough.

211
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:27,463
But as long as you live in my ocean,
you'll obey my rules.

212
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,458
Do you understand that?

213
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:43,419
Children...

214
00:15:43,444 --> 00:15:46,065
You give them an inch,
they swim all over you.

215
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:47,716
Was I too hard on her?

216
00:15:47,741 --> 00:15:49,000
Definitely not.

217
00:15:49,001 --> 00:15:50,624
It's like I always say.

218
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,574
Children got to live
by their parents' rules.

219
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,059
- You're absolutely right, Sebastian.
- Mmm.

220
00:15:57,084 --> 00:16:00,424
- My Ariel needs constant supervision.
- Constant.

221
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:04,107
- Someone to watch over her.
- All the time, day and night.

222
00:16:04,132 --> 00:16:05,785
And you're just the crab to do it.

223
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:08,292
I am just the crab to...
No, wait, that's not, what?

224
00:16:08,317 --> 00:16:12,921
No, see, I serve you, your Majesty,
as your honored majordomo.

225
00:16:12,946 --> 00:16:14,716
There's no better way
you can serve me

226
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,407
than to make sure
my little one stays out of trouble.

227
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:18,832
- But, I...
- Yes?

228
00:16:18,857 --> 00:16:22,227
Go.

229
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:25,000
Yes, your Majesty.

230
00:16:25,623 --> 00:16:27,676
How do I get myself into these situations?

231
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:29,267
I'm an educated crustacean.

232
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:32,000
I got options, and I need this.

233
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:36,407
I should be advising the King,
not chasing after some headstrong teenager.

234
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:13,100
Ariel?
Are you okay?

235
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,508
He doesn't even hear me.

236
00:17:15,533 --> 00:17:20,555
I'm just not like him.
I don't see things the way he does.

237
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,211
And I...

238
00:17:22,235 --> 00:17:28,894
I don't see how a world that makes
such wonderful things can be so bad.

239
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,820

What's wrong with me having a little fun?
Everyone else is.

You, sire, are not everyone else.

306
00:23:07,423 --> 00:23:10,000
It's time you separated yourself
from the rest of the crew.

But I'm one of them.

308
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,431
And behave in a manner
more becoming of a future king.

309
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,440
You mean, be more like my father was?

310
00:23:17,465 --> 00:23:21,400
- Cut off from the rest of the world?
- Oh, Eric, you know what I mean.

311
00:23:21,425 --> 00:23:23,510
When you came to us 21 years ago,

312
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:28,033
the king and queen took you in
and treated you as one of their own.

313
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,848
- Now that you've come of age...
- Max...

314
00:23:30,873 --> 00:23:32,201
Max!

315
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:34,074
What are you doing over there?
Come here, boy.

316
00:23:34,099 --> 00:23:36,092
Come on.

317
00:23:36,117 --> 00:23:36,914
Go on.

318
00:23:36,938 --> 00:23:42,069
Now that you have come of age,
your responsibilities are at home.

319
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:44,169
- Your father would have expected that.
- Yes...

320
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:47,809
Trapped inside that
castle in isolation and fear.

321
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:48,773
I can't do it.

322
00:23:48,797 --> 00:23:52,965
- I believe a little fear may be advisable.
- Grims, you're not listening.

323
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,530
I want to be a different kind of leader.

324
00:23:54,555 --> 00:23:57,963
That's the whole reason
we're on this voyage. Don't you see?

325
00:23:57,988 --> 00:23:59,728
We have to stay open to what's out here.

326
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:02,452
That's the only way our island can grow.

327
00:24:02,477 --> 00:24:04,678
Eric, think what you risk.

328
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:06,265
I can't explain it, Grims.

329
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,185
It's in my blood.

330
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:10,190
Even now, I...

331
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:15,061
I feel there's something
out here calling to me.

332
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:19,614
The storm's coming in fast.

333
00:24:22,422 --> 00:24:23,832
Storm coming in!

334
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:26,619
- All hands on deck!
- All hands on deck!

335
00:24:26,644 --> 00:24:29,550
- Batten down the hatches and crates!
- Yes, sir!

336
00:24:29,574 --> 00:24:31,574
- Stand back!
- Coming through!

337
00:24:33,864 --> 00:24:34,829
Get around quick!

338
00:24:45,469 --> 00:24:48,596
- Clear off and stow the main course!
- We're on it, captain!

339
00:25:38,865 --> 00:25:39,797
Oil lamp!

340
00:25:58,204 --> 00:26:01,000
Lifeboats!
Abandon ship!

341
00:26:01,001 --> 00:26:03,560
Abandon ship!

342
00:26:03,585 --> 00:26:05,000
Into the water, boy!

343
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:07,256
- Go, now!
- Jump!

344
00:26:07,281 --> 00:26:08,741
Aim! Aim!

345
00:26:08,765 --> 00:26:11,198
- Jump!
- We're taking on water!

346
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:16,897
Lifeboat's going sideways!
Do it straight, come on.

347
00:26:24,976 --> 00:26:27,035
- Need a hand?
- You're going faster.

348
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,882
Now!
Hold on, boy!

349
00:26:28,906 --> 00:26:30,139
- Get him up.
- You alright?

350
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,905
Max!

351
00:26:51,228 --> 00:26:54,461
That's it.
Come on, Max. That's it.

352
00:26:56,634 --> 00:26:59,000
On three, don't worry.
Go on.

353
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:04,546
Come on, boy!

354
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:06,460
Right!
Come on!

355
00:27:14,598 --> 00:27:16,490
Come on, Max.
There you go.

356
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:18,193
I gotcha.

357
00:27:18,217 --> 00:27:20,153
Eric!

358
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:15,091
Oh, no.

359
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:17,731
Ah!
Get off me, you fool!

360
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,580
Oh, hey.
Didn't expect to find you here.

361
00:29:20,605 --> 00:29:23,000
And I really didn't
expect to find her here.

362
00:29:23,001 --> 00:29:25,291
Hey, hey, hey.
You listen to me, bird.

363
00:29:25,316 --> 00:29:27,550
The King can never hear of this.

364
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:30,585
We are going to forget this ever happened.

365
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,654
Ow!

366
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,723
- Are you listening to me?
- Yes.

367
00:29:33,748 --> 00:29:36,038
You won't tell him, I won't tell him,

368
00:29:36,063 --> 00:29:37,664
and I will stay in one piece.

369
00:29:37,689 --> 00:29:39,733
- You got it?
- Got it.

370
00:29:39,758 --> 00:29:42,049
- Sorry, what did you say again?
- I'm a dead crab.

No, it's too easy!

396
00:32:06,464 --> 00:32:12,000
She's already in love with the human world,
and now she found her soul mate.

397
00:32:12,001 --> 00:32:13,495
Oh...

398
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:19,081
Oh, wait until Daddy finds out,
he's gonna hit the surface!

399
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:24,927
That little girl's gonna run
straight into my tentacles.

400
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:28,242
Then I'll use her as a
prawn in my little game,

401
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:32,250
and finally get to rip the
power away from Triton.

402
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:36,000
That should have been mine, all along.

403
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:43,000
All right, okay.

404
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:47,304
As long as the King never finds out,
everything will be all right.

405
00:32:47,329 --> 00:32:53,156
He never has to know she used that precious
siren song of hers to save a human.

406
00:32:53,544 --> 00:32:56,502
I just have to find Ariel
and get her back home.

407
00:32:56,527 --> 00:32:58,244
No, uh...

408
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,854
She was around here somewhere.

409
00:32:59,879 --> 00:33:02,841
Ah... Ah, yeah.
This, this must be it.

410
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:05,015
I just have to be firm with her.

411
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,346
Get her to see that this
is all just a passing fad.

412
00:33:07,371 --> 00:33:09,818
And in time, she'll forget all about him.

413
00:33:11,238 --> 00:33:12,605
Ariel!

414
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:16,018
- Sebastian, how did you find me?
- What is all of this?

415
00:33:16,043 --> 00:33:19,902
What are you doing with that, that thing?

416
00:33:19,927 --> 00:33:22,306
Isn't it beautiful?

417
00:33:22,331 --> 00:33:24,100
Look at the longing in his eyes.

418
00:33:24,125 --> 00:33:27,136
What you know about longing?
What is he doing here?

419
00:33:27,161 --> 00:33:28,576
It's from the shipwreck.

420
00:33:28,601 --> 00:33:30,136
I found him at Merman's Reef.

421
00:33:30,161 --> 00:33:31,829
- Bet there's so much more.
- No...

422
00:33:31,854 --> 00:33:35,097
No, Ariel, Ariel...
Child, get back here!

423
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:37,000
Ariel!

424
00:33:37,001 --> 00:33:39,787
You have to let go of this
obsession with humans.

425
00:33:39,812 --> 00:33:41,133
I'm not obsessed.

426
00:33:41,158 --> 00:33:42,996
I may be crusty,
but I'm not blind.

427
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:46,409
- I saw you the night of the shipwreck.
- What?

428
00:33:46,434 --> 00:33:50,268
Your father wants you to stay as
far away from them as possible.

429
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:52,381
- But why?
- You know why.

430
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:55,161
We don't have to be afraid of them.
I know that now.

431
00:33:55,186 --> 00:33:57,664
Sebastian,
if you had just seen it up there.

432
00:33:57,689 --> 00:33:59,497
The ship rode on the wind,

433
00:33:59,521 --> 00:34:03,354
- and they filled the sky with fire.
- Okay, okay, listen to me.

434
00:34:03,379 --> 00:34:06,000
The human world is a mess.

435

Hey, Ariel.

494
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:09,175
Somebody got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

495
00:38:25,057 --> 00:38:29,170
Oh, don't tell me Eric is still going
on about this girl who rescued him.

496
00:38:29,195 --> 00:38:30,654
I'm afraid so.

497
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:34,434
- And the shipwreck, any casualties?
- None, your Majesty.

498
00:38:34,459 --> 00:38:37,834
- Well, thank goodness no lives were lost.
- Indeed.

499
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:41,353
This restless nature of his,
it concerns me.

500
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:43,693
Undertaking these dangerous voyages.

501
00:38:43,718 --> 00:38:45,155
Oh, Eric, sit.

502
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,000
Any sign of that girl yet, Grimsby?

503
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,819
Have some breakfast, please.

504
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:52,287
We looked, sire, but there was no girl.

505
00:38:52,312 --> 00:38:55,000
You were lucky to have made
it ashore before you passed out.

506
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:57,042
- She was real, she saved my life.
- Sit down, Eric.

507
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:59,371
I'm not hungry, Mother.
I'm worried about you.

508
00:38:59,396 --> 00:39:00,851
You've not been yourself
since the shipwreck.

509
00:39:00,876 --> 00:39:02,898
- Have you checked the neighboring islands?
- Not all of them.

510
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,825
- Then I will.
- No, you will not.

511
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,518
You're not leaving this castle
until you're feeling better.

512
00:39:08,543 --> 00:39:10,798
I'll feel better when I find her.

513
00:39:10,823 --> 00:39:13,896
Do not think you're using this girl
as an excuse to run off again.

514
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:16,866
Risking your life on some trade ship
for the sheer adventure?

515
00:39:16,891 --> 00:39:18,826
Sheer adventure?

516
00:39:18,851 --> 00:39:22,681
I'm trying to reach out to other cultures,
so we don't get left behind.

517
00:39:22,706 --> 00:39:26,368
Did you know on this last trip,
we traded alkane for 20 cases of quinine?

518
00:39:26,393 --> 00:39:30,118
- They use it in Europe to treat malaria.
- And where are those 20 cases now?

519
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:31,945
At the bottom of the sea.

520
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,970
How many shipwrecks have there been
in our waters this year, Prime Minister?

521
00:39:34,995 --> 00:39:35,995
Six, your Majesty.

522
00:39:36,001 --> 00:39:38,000
- Did you hear that, Eric?
- Of course I did.

523
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:40,001
Shipwrecks, hurricanes...

524
00:39:40,026 --> 00:39:42,390
The sea gods are against us.

525
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:45,196
How many times do I have to...

526
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:52,052
They are eroding our land from under us.

527
00:39:52,077 --> 00:39:54,026
Stealing it back into the ocean.

528
00:39:54,051 --> 00:39:55,553
They would kill us all if they could.

529
00:39:55,578 --> 00:39:58,053
- It's ridiculous.
- Is it?

530
00:39:58,078 --> 00:40:01,574
May I remind you that a deadly shipwreck
first brought you to us?

531
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:05,199
And now,
I almost lost you to one, the other day.

532
00:40:05,224 --> 00:40:08,207
We cannot keep tempting fate like this.
It has got to stop.

533
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:10,000
What?
What does that mean?

534
00:40:10,001 --> 00:40:14,350
It means that...

535
00:40:14,374 --> 00:40:17,169
that your responsibilities are here now.

536
00:40:17,194 --> 00:40:22,712
So, no more voyages, and no more
chasing after girls who don't exist.

Ariel, could you give me a hand?

569
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:41,824
Ariel!

570
00:43:41,849 --> 00:43:44,617
Oh, yes, of course.

571
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:50,318
Do these humans have any idea
how much damage their shipwrecks do?

572
00:43:50,343 --> 00:43:52,554
I don't think they intended
to have a shipwreck.

573
00:43:52,579 --> 00:43:54,461
They are careless, Ariel.

574
00:43:54,486 --> 00:43:57,459
It will take thousands of years
for this coral to grow back.

575
00:43:57,484 --> 00:43:59,721
And they've killed
nearly all of the sea fern.

576
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:01,901
They'd kill us too if they had the chance.

577
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:04,176
No, no, they're not all like that.

578
00:44:04,201 --> 00:44:06,201
Oh?
How would you know?

579
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,001
You've never even seen one.

580
00:44:08,026 --> 00:44:12,608
You were just a child when Mother died,
and Father stopped us going to the surface.

581
00:44:13,261 --> 00:44:16,642
I just mean, we're not all the same,
so why should humans be?

582
00:44:16,667 --> 00:44:19,263
What about humans?

583
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:21,945
- I just mean...
- Look at what their shipwreck did.

584
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:26,241
They got what they deserved.

585
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:29,068
They're the most dangerous species of all.

586
00:44:29,092 --> 00:44:33,026
Spoiling our waters,
destroying the reefs.

587
00:44:33,051 --> 00:44:38,416
Having no respect for
the balance of the oceans.

588
00:44:38,441 --> 00:44:42,000
They're not the only ones who
have no respect for balance.

589
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:47,076
Ariel, where are you...?

590
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,142
What's going on with her?

591
00:44:49,167 --> 00:44:50,595
Well, she's just at that age

592
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,361
when she doesn't want to hang out
with her older sisters anymore.

593
00:44:53,386 --> 00:44:57,377
- Exactly. You remember what I was like.
- How could we forget?

594
00:44:57,402 --> 00:45:01,524
Well, I wonder who the lucky merman is?

595
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:14,352
The crown, your Majesty.

596
00:45:15,847 --> 00:45:17,846
Come over here, Sebastian.

597
00:45:20,692 --> 00:45:24,533
Breathe, Sebastian.
Remember, guilty is as guilty acts.

598
00:45:24,558 --> 00:45:28,538
Don't overreact.
Remain calm.

599
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:36,289
Yes!
Yes, your Majesty.

600
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:42,912
Sebastian, have you noticed that
Ariel has been acting peculiar lately?

601
00:45:42,937 --> 00:45:44,992
- Peculiar, sir?
- Mhm.

602
00:45:45,017 --> 00:45:49,974
Distracted, daydreaming,
disappearing for hours.

603
00:45:49,999 --> 00:45:51,848
You haven't noticed?

604
00:45:51,873 --> 00:45:55,874
Oh, well, I, um...

605
00:45:56,999 --> 00:46:00,518
Uh, I actually haven't...
You know, um...

606
00:46:00,543 --> 00:46:03,976
- That is to say, I didn't, um...
- Shh...

607
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,113
Shh!

608
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,067
- Sebastian...
- Hm?

609
00:46:07,092 --> 00:46:09,900
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

610
00:46:09,925 --> 00:46:12,860
- Keeping something?
- Mhm!

611
00:46:12,885 --> 00:46:14,796
About Ariel.

612
00:46:14,821 --> 00:46:16,251
Ariel?

613
00:46:24,209 --> 00:46:26,731
Is my little one in love?

614
00:46:29,001 --> 00:46:30,581
Oh, I tried to stop her, sir!

615
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:32,181
I tried to stop her from
going to the surface.

616
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,906
I told her to stay away
from humans, but...

617
00:46:33,931 --> 00:46:35,427
Humans!

618
00:46:35,452 --> 00:46:38,799
Humans?
Who said anything about humans?

619
00:46:41,684 --> 00:46:43,604
Let's just drop these things off
and go back.

620
00:46:43,629 --> 00:46:44,629
No way.

621
00:46:44,654 --> 00:46:47,781
- With all that great stuff still down there?
- Don't we have enough already?

622
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:50,328
Ugh, come on, Flounder.
We're just getting started.

623
00:46:50,353 --> 00:46:57,307
So, you broke the rules.

624
00:46:57,332 --> 00:46:59,653
You went to the above world.

625
00:47:02,073 --> 00:47:04,740
There was a shipwreck.

626
00:47:04,765 --> 00:47:07,425
A man was drowning.
I had to save him.

627
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,867
You should have let him drown.

628
00:47:09,892 --> 00:47:11,522
They're savages.

629
00:47:11,547 --> 00:47:14,172
You don't know that.

630
00:47:14,197 --> 00:47:16,787
They killed your mother.

631
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:19,851
I know.

632
00:47:19,876 --> 00:47:22,476
But one man did.

633
00:47:22,501 --> 00:47:24,732
Why blame every human?

634
00:47:24,757 --> 00:47:26,117
- Mother wouldn't...
- No.

635
00:47:26,142 --> 00:47:28,150
Enough.
That's enough.

636
00:47:28,175 --> 00:47:31,975
- And Eric had nothing to do with it.
- Eric?

637
00:47:32,335 --> 00:47:33,850
Eric?

638
00:47:33,874 --> 00:47:36,082
Have you lost your
senses completely?

639
00:47:36,107 --> 00:47:38,238
You would have just heard him, Father.

640
00:47:38,263 --> 00:47:41,000
He's compassionate and kind.

641
00:47:41,001 --> 00:47:43,489
He's a human!
You're a mermaid!

642
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:45,583
Yes, but that doesn't make us enemies.

643
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:48,209
Promise me you will
never look for him again.

644
00:47:48,234 --> 00:47:49,138
I can't.

645
00:47:49,163 --> 00:47:52,529
- Promise me, Ariel.
- I can't lie to you. I won't.

646
00:47:52,554 --> 00:47:55,512
I swear I will get through to you!

647
00:47:55,537 --> 00:47:56,827
No!

648
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:58,876
Please!

649
00:47:58,901 --> 00:48:00,188
Father, stop!

650
00:48:00,213 --> 00:48:03,799
This ends now!

651
00:48:03,824 --> 00:48:05,579
Please!
Stop it!

652
00:48:05,604 --> 00:48:08,448
It's for your own good!

653
00:48:09,975 --> 00:48:11,521
Father, no!

654
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,717
Never leave again.

655
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:10,325
- Ariel, I'm...
- Just go away.

656
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,251
Poor child.

657
00:49:29,276 --> 00:49:32,000
Poor sweet child.

658
00:49:32,001 --> 00:49:35,297
He can be so angry.

659
00:49:35,322 --> 00:49:39,202
He thinks he knows everything.

660
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:40,689
Who are you?

661
00:49:40,714 --> 00:49:43,652
Oh, you must not remember me.

662
00:49:43,677 --> 00:49:46,852
I'm your Auntie Ursula.

663
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:50,860
- The, the sea witch?
- The what?

664
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:54,453
What has your father told you about me?

665
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:55,551
That...

666
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,848
That you like to stir up trouble
between humans and merpeople.

667
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:02,721
Oh, is that what he said?

668
00:50:02,746 --> 00:50:06,119
I'm not half the monster he claims I am.

669
00:50:06,144 --> 00:50:09,399
And I'm only here to help.

670
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,851
I don't need your help.

671
00:50:11,876 --> 00:50:15,000
Whatever you say, darling.

672
00:50:19,073 --> 00:50:22,797
- Wait!
- Yes?

673
00:50:24,023 --> 00:50:26,770
How can you help me?

674
00:50:34,667 --> 00:50:37,002
Ariel!

675
00:50:37,027 --> 00:50:40,836
Where is she going with those
slippery good-for-nothings?

676
00:50:40,861 --> 00:50:42,883
Let's go.

677
00:52:06,413 --> 00:52:09,780
Come in.
Come in, child.

678
00:52:09,805 --> 00:52:13,000
You mustn't lurk in passageways.

679
00:52:13,001 --> 00:52:15,585
It's rude.

680
00:52:15,610 --> 00:52:18,172
Forgive my aggressive garden.

681
00:52:18,197 --> 00:52:20,805
I wouldn't choose to live like this.

682
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,273
Believe me.

683
00:52:23,298 --> 00:52:25,785
Daddy's been so unfair to both of us.

684
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:30,536
Controlling everything we say and do.

685
00:52:30,561 --> 00:52:35,000
In a way,
we're the same, you and I.

686
00:52:35,001 --> 00:52:38,441
You don't seem at all
like father described you.

687
00:52:38,466 --> 00:52:40,495
Is that right?

688
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,521
Hmm.

689
00:52:41,546 --> 00:52:43,388
We never did get along.

690
00:52:43,413 --> 00:52:45,533
Squibling rivalry.

691
00:52:45,558 --> 00:52:47,760
He always got what he wanted,
and what did I get?

692
00:52:47,785 --> 00:52:52,080
Nothing!
Zip, nada, squat!

693
00:52:52,105 --> 00:52:54,561
Sound familiar, hun?

694
00:52:54,586 --> 00:52:57,828
Oh, I know what you're
going through, believe me.

695
00:52:57,853 --> 00:53:01,000
And I know why you're here.

696
00:53:01,001 --> 00:53:05,000
- I'm not sure I do.
- Oh, please!

697
00:53:05,001 --> 00:53:08,734
I've been watching you
for a long time now, dearie.

698
00:53:08,759 --> 00:53:13,216
What you really want is to be up there,
in the above world.

699
00:53:13,241 --> 00:53:16,007
It's always had your curiosity.

700
00:53:16,032 --> 00:53:19,335
And now, it's got your heart.

701
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,034
What do you mean?

702
00:53:22,059 --> 00:53:24,603
You're so young.

703
00:53:24,628 --> 00:53:26,936
Don't you see?

704
00:53:26,961 --> 00:53:30,205
You're meant for each other.

705
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:34,000
I can't bear to see you suffer like this.

706
00:53:34,001 --> 00:53:37,770
As it happens,
I can help you.

707
00:53:37,795 --> 00:53:41,112
How?

708
00:53:41,137 --> 00:53:43,426
The problem is simple.

709
00:53:43,451 --> 00:53:50,824
You can't live in that world unless,
you become a human yourself.

710
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:53,537
Become human?

711
00:53:53,562 --> 00:53:58,192
- Is that even possible?
- Oh, my dear.

712
00:53:58,217 --> 00:54:01,439
It's what I do.

713
00:54:01,464 --> 00:54:04,000
It's what I live for.

- Shh.

734
00:55:39,611 --> 00:55:41,804
So here's the deal.

735
00:55:41,829 --> 00:55:45,245
I'll whip up a little potion to
make you human for three days.

736
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:46,608
Got that?

737
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:48,468
Three days.

738
00:55:48,493 --> 00:55:53,281
Before the sun sets on the third day,
you and Princey must share a kiss.

739
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:55,381
And not just any kiss.

740
00:55:55,406 --> 00:55:58,930
The kiss of true love.

741
00:55:58,955 --> 00:56:03,850
If you do, you will remain
human permanently.

742
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:10,000
But if you don't,
you'll turn back into a mermaid.

743
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:13,163
And you belong to me.

744
00:56:13,188 --> 00:56:15,775
- No, Ariel!
- Shh!

745
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,475
You understand, of
course, that you'll have to...

746
00:56:18,499 --> 00:56:21,000
give up your mermaid gifts.

747
00:56:21,001 --> 00:56:25,601
You won't have this tail of yours,
hanging around, dragging you down.

748
00:56:25,626 --> 00:56:30,424
You won't be able to breathe underwater.
Who needs it?

749
00:56:30,449 --> 00:56:33,895
And you'll no longer have
that siren song of yours.

750
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,880
Because that wouldn't
be fair now, would it?

751
00:56:37,905 --> 00:56:39,319
Don't worry.

752
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:44,941
I'll keep it safe and soundness,
here with me.

753
00:56:44,966 --> 00:56:49,236
We got a deal?

754
00:56:49,261 --> 00:56:51,100
I don't know.

755
00:56:51,125 --> 00:56:55,885
Well, I might as well just give
you the premium package, kid.

756
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,610
No.

757
00:56:58,635 --> 00:57:03,405
Life's full of tough choices, innit?

758
00:57:05,578 --> 00:57:07,000
No.

759
00:57:07,001 --> 00:57:10,096
This is wrong. I can't do this.

760
00:57:10,121 --> 00:57:13,122
Fine, then!
Forget about the world above.

761
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:15,529
Go back home to Daddy,

762
00:57:15,554 --> 00:57:18,596

Keep singing!

778
00:58:53,512 --> 00:58:58,978
Yes!

779
00:59:01,627 --> 00:59:05,482
Look at her stupid little feet!

780
00:59:25,487 --> 00:59:28,112
Oh, Ariel.

781
00:59:28,137 --> 00:59:29,331
Well?

782
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:35,179
Come on, girl. It's
either sink or swim.

783
00:59:43,204 --> 00:59:44,743
Don't worry, boys.

784
00:59:44,768 --> 00:59:49,158
She doesn't stand a chance without this.

785
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:51,783
A mermaid without her voice.

786
00:59:51,807 --> 00:59:54,116
Ha!

787
00:59:54,141 --> 01:00:00,259
And just in case, I slipped a little
something extra into that spell of mine.

788
01:00:00,284 --> 01:00:03,452
No matter how hard that girl tries,

789
01:00:03,476 --> 01:00:07,791
she won't remember
she needs to get that kiss.

790
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:11,838
Now it's just a matter of time.

791
01:00:11,863 --> 01:00:17,351
And she's mine.

792
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:25,125
Not so easy without your tail, is it?

793
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,270
Keep going.

794
01:00:26,295 --> 01:00:29,090
You just got to get your sea legs.

795
01:00:29,115 --> 01:00:31,162
We almost there.

796
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:42,213
Get away from here!

797
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:44,100
Lord have mercy.

798
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:49,281
You all right?

799
01:00:50,641 --> 01:00:55,000
The poor girl,
must be in shock.

800
01:00:55,001 --> 01:00:57,634
I'll go find something to cover you up.

801
01:00:57,659 --> 01:01:01,763
Another shipwreck, Santa Maria.

802
01:01:21,863 --> 01:01:23,698
Say, what's going on, kid?

803
01:01:23,723 --> 01:01:24,931
I thought you
weren't supposed to be up here.

804
01:01:24,956 --> 01:01:26,200
Now you're taking boat rides?

805
01:01:26,225 --> 01:01:29,353
That rotten sea witch,
she stole Ariel's voice.

806
01:01:29,378 --> 01:01:30,534
Hey, Flounder.

807
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:31,681
What are you talking about?

808
01:01:31,706 --> 01:01:34,318
So Sebastian told Triton,
that Ariel saved a human.

809
01:01:34,343 --> 01:01:35,666
- and Triton got so mad
- Okay, okay.

810
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:37,423
- Explanations later, man.
- And, then... Wait.

811
01:01:37,448 --> 01:01:38,856
- We got to get you out of here.
- Wait!

812
01:01:38,881 --> 01:01:40,667
- I didn't tell you about the sea witch.
- Bye-bye.

813
01:01:40,692 --> 01:01:44,000
And don't tell anyone about the sea witch.

814
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:47,330
Something about you seems different.

815
01:01:47,355 --> 01:01:48,688
Don't tell me.

816
01:01:48,713 --> 01:01:50,861
It's your hairdo, right?

817
01:01:50,886 --> 01:01:53,135
Because you've been
using the dinglehopper, no?

818
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:56,860
I can't,
I can't quite figure it out.

819
01:01:56,885 --> 01:01:59,386
But I know that if I stand here
for long enough.

820
01:01:59,410 --> 01:02:02,000
She got legs, ya idiot!

821
01:02:02,001 --> 01:02:03,743
You know, we've discussed this.

822
01:02:03,768 --> 01:02:05,348
I don't like it when you call me an idiot.

823
01:02:05,373 --> 01:02:06,748
Why don't you tell me something nice?

824
01:02:06,773 --> 01:02:10,000
- "Hey, Scuttle, your feathers look good."
- Shoo!

825
01:02:10,001 --> 01:02:11,243
Here you are.

826
01:02:11,268 --> 01:02:13,276
It'll have to do for now.

827
01:02:13,301 --> 01:02:15,103
I'll take you to the castle.

828
01:02:15,128 --> 01:02:17,266
They'll know what to do with you there.

get that witch to give them back,

926
01:09:07,025 --> 01:09:10,848
Oh no, she's put a spell on you.

928
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:15,714
Now what are we gonna do?

929
01:09:15,739 --> 01:09:17,674
Well, we got no time to lose,

930
01:09:17,699 --> 01:09:23,245
We just gotta find a way
to get the two of you together.

931
01:09:25,238 --> 01:09:30,327
You are hopeless, child,
you know that?

932
01:09:30,352 --> 01:09:33,420

Oh, there you are,

938

Has Ariel killed the Prince yet?

ya bird brain.

941
01:09:58,773 --> 01:10:01,974
And it's worse than we thought,
the witch has placed a spell on her.

942
01:10:01,999 --> 01:10:03,674
Soon as I tell her she's got to kiss him,

943
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:06,142
the thought jumps
clear right out of her head.

944
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,858
- So now it's up to us.
- To kiss the Prince?

945
01:10:09,562 --> 01:10:11,562
- Forget it.
- Where's Ariel now?

946
01:10:11,587 --> 01:10:14,373
What do you mean,
she's right here.

947
01:10:15,883 --> 01:10:17,456
Oh.

948
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,717
What are you doing in here, child?

949
01:12:20,751 --> 01:12:23,581
You can't just go wandering around
wherever you please.

950
01:12:23,606 --> 01:12:27,412
- Hide!
- Who's in here?

951
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:35,369
Oh, it's you.

952
01:12:41,344 --> 01:12:43,753
Nobody usually comes in here.

953
01:12:46,766 --> 01:12:49,846
My little mermaid.

954
01:12:49,871 --> 01:12:51,939
It's alright,
it's alright.

955
01:12:51,964 --> 01:12:53,586
You can look at it.

956
01:12:53,611 --> 01:12:56,813
I found her on the coast of Cartageña.

957
01:12:56,838 --> 01:13:01,000
Isn't she beautiful?

958
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:05,715
Oh, that's right, you...

959
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:08,000
Well, it really doesn't matter.

960
01:13:08,025 --> 01:13:13,046
Most people around here
use too many words and have nothing to say.

961
01:13:13,071 --> 01:13:16,458
You know, I never believed all that lore.

962
01:13:16,483 --> 01:13:21,583
Mermaids luring sailors to their deaths.

963
01:13:21,608 --> 01:13:24,606
Here.
Take her.

964
01:13:24,631 --> 01:13:27,426
No, really,
I want you to have her.

965
01:13:27,451 --> 01:13:30,226
I'm running out of space as it is.

966
01:13:30,251 --> 01:13:33,534
Nearly all of these things
come from my voyages.

967
01:13:33,559 --> 01:13:37,567
I know it must seem silly,
collecting all this stuff, but...

968
01:13:37,592 --> 01:13:39,536
Just look at this fossilized sea stone.

969
01:13:39,561 --> 01:13:45,764
Can you believe that such
amazing things exist down there?

970
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:46,915
No, wait!

971
01:13:55,339 --> 01:13:58,979
How did you know that was in there?

972
01:13:59,004 --> 01:14:02,293
All this time?

973
01:14:02,318 --> 01:14:05,215
It's incredible.

974
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:06,758
- Oh, that?
- Hey, girl.

975
01:14:06,783 --> 01:14:11,000
That I just picked up
from the beach here on the island.

976
01:14:11,025 --> 01:14:14,653
There's loads of them
in this time of year.

977
01:14:19,674 --> 01:14:23,423
I had no idea you could do that.

978
01:14:23,448 --> 01:14:25,436
Oh, me?

979
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,949
No, oh, really?

980
01:14:27,974 --> 01:14:30,653
Alright, and...

981
01:14:30,677 --> 01:14:33,073
How do I...?

982
01:14:33,098 --> 01:14:35,764
Yeah, that's it,
that's it, girl.

983
01:14:35,789 --> 01:14:38,428
Go get it, go get it,
I see ya.

984
01:14:38,453 --> 01:14:39,685
Go on, come now...

985
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:40,768
Oh.

986
01:14:45,344 --> 01:14:47,393
Alright.

987
01:14:47,418 --> 01:14:49,621
Yeah, well...

988
01:14:49,645 --> 01:14:51,494
I'll work on that.

989
01:14:52,334 --> 01:14:56,156
I love the people there.
Their culture, their custom.

990
01:14:56,181 --> 01:14:59,323
This whole region is known as
the Brazilian Empire.

991
01:14:59,348 --> 01:15:05,396
And there's Venezuela, Colombia.

992
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:11,000
Oh, the area up here
is called Mosquito Coast.

993
01:15:11,001 --> 01:15:13,929
Those waters are all uncharted.

994
01:15:14,558 --> 01:15:19,840
Wouldn't it be amazing to discover
some place no one's ever seen before?

995
01:15:22,473 --> 01:15:24,325
Ah, but this...

996
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:27,279
This was one of my favorite voyages.

997
01:15:27,304 --> 01:15:31,568
I brought that Peruvian rug there, along
with six of the looms they used to make it.

998
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:33,702
Oh, another one.

999
01:15:33,727 --> 01:15:35,859
All right.

1000
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:36,976
Ah...

1001
01:15:37,001 --> 01:15:39,678
This is our island.

1002
01:15:39,703 --> 01:15:42,361
We're in that very castle right now.

1003
01:15:42,386 --> 01:15:44,746
Over here's our main village.

1004
01:15:44,771 --> 01:15:49,112
Our port there was once
the busiest in the region.

1005
01:15:49,137 --> 01:15:52,558
I'm hoping it will be again one day.

1006
01:15:52,583 --> 01:15:56,238
And there's a beautiful lagoon
with a little waterfall right here.

1007
01:15:56,263 --> 01:16:00,038
And then all of that, is rainforest.

1008
01:16:00,063 --> 01:16:04,000
I could show you around, if you like.

1009
01:16:04,224 --> 01:16:05,790
All right.

1010
01:16:05,815 --> 01:16:08,059
- We'll go tomorrow.
- But, sire.

1011
01:16:08,084 --> 01:16:10,000
Oh, Grimsby, good.

1012
01:16:10,001 --> 01:16:12,590
We'll need a horse and carriage
ready for us in the morning.

1013
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:15,164
May I have a quiet word, sire?

1014
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,145
Of course.

1015
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:22,685
He's a special one, isn't he?

1016
01:16:22,710 --> 01:16:24,418
And that moonlight, ah!

1017
01:16:27,751 --> 01:16:31,761
We were going to send out all the
carriages tomorrow to look for the girl.

1018
01:16:31,786 --> 01:16:32,895
The girl...

1019
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:35,000
Oh, I wasn't thinking.
Of course, yes.

1020
01:16:35,001 --> 01:16:36,733
We must do that.
Absolutely.

1021
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,251
And I must remind you, Eric,

1022
01:16:38,276 --> 01:16:41,124
what your mother said yesterday
about you not leaving the castle

1023
01:16:41,149 --> 01:16:43,688
- until you're feeling better.
- Grimsby, I feel fine.

1024
01:16:43,713 --> 01:16:45,655
I feel better than ever.

1025
01:16:46,299 --> 01:16:48,534
Yes.

1026
01:16:48,559 --> 01:16:51,299
Yes, I can see that.

1027
01:16:51,324 --> 01:16:55,727
I suppose we could
spare one carriage.

1028
01:17:19,811 --> 01:17:21,559
Looks like you made a friend there.

1029
01:17:21,584 --> 01:17:23,000
Come on, Max.

1030
01:17:23,001 --> 01:17:24,433
We'll see you later.

1031
01:17:24,458 --> 01:17:26,363
Oh, no.
You're not going without me.

1032
01:17:26,388 --> 01:17:28,190
Only got two days left.

1033
01:17:28,215 --> 01:17:30,000
I'm a crab on a mission.

1034
01:17:30,001 --> 01:17:32,395
Trot on, Peter.

1035
01:17:35,956 --> 01:17:38,151
I'm getting too old for this.

1036
01:17:38,176 --> 01:17:39,063
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

1037
01:17:39,088 --> 01:17:41,143
Down, beast.

1038
01:17:45,634 --> 01:17:46,820
I still got it.

1039
01:17:51,001 --> 01:17:53,613
Who is that riding out with Prince Eric?

1040
01:17:53,638 --> 01:17:55,573
Is that the girl
who washed up the other day?

1041
01:17:55,598 --> 01:17:58,048
Yes, it is, Lashana.

1042
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,556
Didn't the queen tell
him to stay in the castle?

1043
01:18:00,581 --> 01:18:02,089
Yes, she did, Lashana.

1044
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:05,175
Aren't you going to get into trouble
for fetching him a carriage?

1045
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:09,248
What carriage, Lashana?

1046
01:18:32,305 --> 01:18:35,000
Do you want to try?

1047
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:37,365
Here.

1048
01:18:49,097 --> 01:18:50,477
Look out!
Look out!

1049
01:18:57,484 --> 01:19:00,317
Sorry about that!

1050
01:19:01,385 --> 01:19:03,274
That was close.

1051
01:19:03,299 --> 01:19:04,152
Whoa!

1052
01:19:04,176 --> 01:19:06,712
Get out!
Get out of the way!

1053
01:19:06,737 --> 01:19:09,805
- Turn!
- Look out!

1054
01:19:26,757 --> 01:19:29,603
That was fun.

1055
01:19:33,289 --> 01:19:36,000
Let me give you a hand.

1056
01:19:36,001 --> 01:19:38,202
Here we go.
This way, come on.

1057
01:19:38,227 --> 01:19:40,204
This way.

1058
01:19:40,229 --> 01:19:41,609
Here we go.

1059
01:19:41,634 --> 01:19:44,069
Go on, that's it.

1060
01:19:44,094 --> 01:19:47,676
Thank you, lad.

1061
01:20:04,586 --> 01:20:05,899
Island berry?

1062
01:20:05,924 --> 01:20:09,052
Oh, is it pretty?

1063
01:20:09,077 --> 01:20:10,398
- Whoa!
- Coconut!

1064
01:20:10,422 --> 01:20:13,818
- Fresh fruit!
- Coconut!

1065
01:20:13,843 --> 01:20:16,840
Fresh coconut?

1066
01:20:16,865 --> 01:20:18,506
No?
You don't want it?

1067
01:20:18,531 --> 01:20:22,612
Got some water here.

1068
01:20:22,637 --> 01:20:23,250
Thank you, miss.

1069
01:20:23,275 --> 01:20:28,402
Young lady, would you like to try some?

1070
01:20:28,403 --> 01:20:31,308
Oh, I think you'll be needing this.

1071
01:20:32,712 --> 01:20:33,518
You want this?

1072
01:20:48,728 --> 01:20:51,274
- Thank you.
- Good day, sire.

1073
01:20:53,721 --> 01:20:57,618
Hat for the lady?

1074
01:20:57,643 --> 01:21:01,091
Oh, there you are.

1075
01:21:01,115 --> 01:21:01,977
Oh.

1076
01:21:02,001 --> 01:21:04,052
No, no.
Too big.

1077
01:21:04,077 --> 01:21:05,568
Try this.

1078
01:21:11,552 --> 01:21:13,715
Tropical flowers?

1079
01:21:46,966 --> 01:21:47,975
Hey.

1080
01:21:51,591 --> 01:21:53,300
Hey!
Everybody, everybody!

1081
01:21:53,325 --> 01:21:55,434
Way, hey.
Hey, hey!

1082
01:22:00,289 --> 01:22:03,181
- Say, any kissing yet?
- No.

1083
01:22:03,206 --> 01:22:06,361
When it comes to romance,
these two are slow as snails.

1084
01:22:06,386 --> 01:22:08,051
Hey, go find Flounder.

1085
01:22:08,076 --> 01:22:10,276
We got to move this thing along, and quick.

1086
01:22:10,301 --> 01:22:14,020
Okay, bossy.

1087
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,149
Hey!

1088
01:22:20,173 --> 01:22:20,833
Pick it up!

1089
01:22:20,858 --> 01:22:23,076
Bring it here, bring it here,
bring it here, y'all!

1090
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:25,457
Back it up, back it up, back it up!

1091
01:22:25,481 --> 01:22:26,290
Woo!

1092
01:22:26,314 --> 01:22:30,000
Hey!

1093
01:22:30,001 --> 01:22:31,313
Come on, now!

1094
01:22:47,624 --> 01:22:50,564
I love this time of night.

1095
01:22:50,589 --> 01:22:53,741
Sometimes you'll see
the eyes of a screech owl...

1096
01:22:53,765 --> 01:22:56,099
- Up in the tree.
- Hey! Hey!

1097
01:22:56,124 --> 01:22:58,319
Hey, come back with that!

1098
01:22:58,344 --> 01:22:59,329
Come on!

1099
01:23:02,759 --> 01:23:04,067
I think it went this way.

1100
01:23:04,092 --> 01:23:05,480
You alright?

1101
01:23:05,505 --> 01:23:06,979
Hey!

1102
01:23:07,004 --> 01:23:09,536
Give me my hat back!

1103
01:23:14,224 --> 01:23:16,088
Oh, all right then.

1104
01:23:20,740 --> 01:23:23,249
I didn't want to lose this.

1105
01:23:38,559 --> 01:23:41,264
Move your big fat feathers, bird.
I can't see a thing.

1106
01:23:41,289 --> 01:23:43,889
- Well, that worked pretty good, didn't it?
- But nothing's happening.

1107
01:23:43,914 --> 01:23:46,591
We're running out of time
and no one's puckered up once.

1108
01:23:46,616 --> 01:23:52,540
I think it's time for a little
vocal romantic stimulation.

1109
01:23:52,565 --> 01:23:53,680
Please, no.

1110
01:23:53,705 --> 01:23:55,053
- Scoot over?
- Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.

1111
01:23:55,078 --> 01:23:56,868
- You gotta be...
- Bow-chicka-wow-wow!

1112
01:23:56,893 --> 01:23:58,341
- Chicka-wow-wow!
- Shh!

1113
01:23:58,366 --> 01:23:59,368
Chicka-wow!

1114
01:24:01,431 --> 01:24:03,985
- Wow-wow-wow!
- Alright, gosh!

1115
01:24:04,010 --> 01:24:06,000
- I was off, I was off on that one.
- No...

1116
01:24:06,001 --> 01:24:07,001
Let me find it.
Let me find it.

1117
01:24:07,001 --> 01:24:09,084
- Wow!
- You're finished?

1118
01:24:09,109 --> 01:24:11,000
- Wow.
- Alright, alright.

1119
01:24:11,001 --> 01:24:13,662
Listen!
Ariel cannot know we're helping.

1120
01:24:13,687 --> 01:24:15,994
If she sees or hears us,
she'll shut us down.

1121
01:24:16,019 --> 01:24:18,578
Nah, man.
We got to be sneaky about this.

1122
01:24:18,603 --> 01:24:23,000
We got to work on the Prince,
using the power of suggestion.

1123
01:24:23,001 --> 01:24:24,201
Good.

1124
01:24:24,226 --> 01:24:25,881
How are we going to do that?

1125
01:24:25,906 --> 01:24:30,926
We got to blend in with the sounds
of nature so she doesn't hear us.

1126
01:24:30,951 --> 01:24:38,186
Percussion.

1127
01:24:38,211 --> 01:24:43,794
Strings.

1128
01:24:43,819 --> 01:24:50,401
Winds.

1129
01:24:50,426 --> 01:24:52,564

What a clear night.

1144
01:26:06,830 --> 01:26:09,871
You can see Orion.

1145
01:26:09,896 --> 01:26:10,750
Well, the...

1146
01:26:10,775 --> 01:26:14,390
The sailors use the
constellations to navigate.

1147
01:26:14,415 --> 01:26:18,454
That one's Orion, the hunter.

1148
01:26:18,479 --> 01:26:23,149
There's Ares, the ram.

1149
01:26:23,174 --> 01:26:25,974
That's Cassiopeia.

1150
01:26:25,999 --> 01:26:27,988
That's funny.

1151
01:26:28,013 --> 01:26:31,168
Still don't know your name.

1152
01:26:31,193 --> 01:26:32,553
Let's see.

1153
01:26:32,578 --> 01:26:34,773
Is it...

1154
01:26:34,798 --> 01:26:37,073
Diana?

1155
01:26:37,098 --> 01:26:39,309
No.

1156
01:26:39,334 --> 01:26:41,429
Or...

1157
01:26:41,453 --> 01:26:43,734
Catherine?

1158
01:26:43,759 --> 01:26:47,746
No, definitely not Catherine.

1159
01:26:47,771 --> 01:26:52,618
Wow.

1160
01:26:52,643 --> 01:26:57,396
Sky, no.

1161
01:26:59,677 --> 01:27:01,689
Aries?

1162
01:27:01,714 --> 01:27:03,662
Aries.

01:27:11,136 --> 01:27:14,478
Arie-l?

1167
01:27:14,503 --> 01:27:18,583
Ariel.

1168
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:20,844
That's a beautiful name.

1169
01:27:25,095 --> 01:27:28,103

01:28:47,807 --> 01:28:49,000
What?

1189
01:28:49,001 --> 01:28:50,968
What was that?

1190
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:00,528
That was close.

1191
01:29:00,553 --> 01:29:01,802
Too close.

1192
01:29:03,599 --> 01:29:05,199
I don't get it.

1193
01:29:05,224 --> 01:29:10,741
I didn't think that little barracuda stood
a chance luring him in without a voice.

1194
01:29:10,766 --> 01:29:13,093
How's that even possible?

1195
01:29:13,118 --> 01:29:16,361
Well, we're not gonna
let that happen again.

1196
01:29:16,386 --> 01:29:20,214
It's time Ursula took matters
into her own tentacles.

1197
01:29:20,239 --> 01:29:21,919
Where is it?

1198
01:29:21,944 --> 01:29:25,031
Come on.
Come on, it's gotta be here somewhere.

1199
01:29:25,056 --> 01:29:28,946
No, no.

1200
01:29:28,971 --> 01:29:33,537
Nobody ever puts my things back!

1201
01:29:33,562 --> 01:29:37,000
No, where is it?

1202
01:29:40,098 --> 01:29:41,548
No!

1203
01:29:43,976 --> 01:29:46,726
No, no, no.

1204
01:29:46,751 --> 01:29:50,136
No!

1205
01:29:50,161 --> 01:29:51,789
Oh, there it is.

1206
01:29:51,814 --> 01:29:52,755
I got it.

1207
01:29:52,779 --> 01:29:53,884
Huh.

1208
01:29:53,909 --> 01:29:57,767
That prince won't know what hit him.

1209
01:29:57,792 --> 01:30:01,014
Only one more sunset.

1210
01:30:01,039 --> 01:30:05,235
Then I'll make Triton writhe.

1211
01:30:05,260 --> 01:30:10,035
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook.

1212
01:30:18,284 --> 01:30:19,305
So where is she?

1213
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,185
- We don't know, father.
- She's gone.

1214
01:30:21,210 --> 01:30:22,623
What do you mean she's gone?

1215
01:30:22,648 --> 01:30:24,000
We've been looking and looking.

1216
01:30:24,001 --> 01:30:26,402
There's no sign of her anywhere.
She's not in these waters.

1217
01:30:26,427 --> 01:30:27,500
Then, look again.

1218
01:30:27,525 --> 01:30:31,519
Search all of the seven seas,
if you have to.

1219
01:30:31,544 --> 01:30:35,123
- Ariel wouldn't dare go above...
- Don't get him think such a thing.

1220
01:30:35,148 --> 01:30:37,288
It doesn't make sense.
Why would she leave?

1221
01:30:37,313 --> 01:30:39,101
I...
I have no idea.

1222
01:30:39,126 --> 01:30:41,406
Never mind that.
Just find her.

1223
01:31:05,235 --> 01:31:12,475
What have I done?

1224
01:31:19,626 --> 01:31:21,447
Everyone's asleep.

1225
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,647
We should probably be quiet.

1226
01:31:22,672 --> 01:31:24,695
- His room, all day?
- Wait.

1227
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,620
- Go, go, go. Come on, then.
- I haven't seen him.

1228
01:31:26,645 --> 01:31:28,648
I would imagine, he's just resting.

1229
01:31:28,673 --> 01:31:31,182
- Has he been avoiding me?
- No, your Majesty.

1230
01:31:31,207 --> 01:31:33,747
- No?
- No.

1231
01:31:33,772 --> 01:31:35,223
You seem awfully certain.

1232
01:31:35,248 --> 01:31:37,494
Avoiding you,
doesn't seem like Eric, does it?

1233
01:31:37,519 --> 01:31:38,887
Then where is he?

1234
01:31:38,912 --> 01:31:43,070
Oh, he's not searching
for that fantasy girl, I hope.

1235
01:31:43,095 --> 01:31:46,388
No, your Majesty.
That, I can say with certainty.

1236
01:31:46,413 --> 01:31:48,295
Thank heavens for small blessings.

1237
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,707
Ooh!
Oh!

1238
01:31:49,732 --> 01:31:52,000
- Ooh, it's wet.
- No, no.

1239
01:31:52,001 --> 01:31:55,486
I'll look into it.
You really must get some rest yourself.

1240
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:57,249
Yes, I suppose I should.

1241
01:31:57,274 --> 01:32:00,062
Thank you, Grimsby.
Good night.

1242
01:32:00,087 --> 01:32:02,137
Sorry about that.

1243
01:32:02,162 --> 01:32:04,995
I wasn't supposed to
leave the castle today.

1244
01:32:05,020 --> 01:32:06,478
But I'm glad I did.

1245
01:32:08,624 --> 01:32:11,626
All these rules.

1246
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:14,710
The truth is, I wasn't born to all this.

1247
01:32:14,735 --> 01:32:16,150
It all makes me feel
a little uncomfortable...

1248
01:32:16,175 --> 01:32:21,000
- Welcome back, sire!
- Oh, Grimsby.

1249
01:32:21,001 --> 01:32:23,712
I trust you two have had
a pleasant outing.

1250
01:32:23,736 --> 01:32:25,225
Yes, we did,
didn't we?

1251
01:32:25,250 --> 01:32:27,112
Yes, very nice.

1252
01:32:27,137 --> 01:32:28,539
You've had a long day, miss.

1253
01:32:28,564 --> 01:32:31,309
I imagine we should let you get some sleep.

1254
01:32:31,334 --> 01:32:33,495
And perhaps dried off as well.

1255
01:32:33,520 --> 01:32:34,840
Oh, yes.

1256
01:32:34,865 --> 01:32:38,907
We took a rowboat out onto the lagoon,
and I'm afraid we ended up in it.

1257
01:32:38,932 --> 01:32:41,917
Anyway, good night.

1258
01:32:51,133 --> 01:32:53,332
Good night.

1259
01:32:53,357 --> 01:32:54,852
Ariel.

1260
01:33:01,516 --> 01:33:04,118
About the carriages, sire.

1261
01:33:04,143 --> 01:33:09,443
I'm afraid they,
didn't find the mystery girl.

1262
01:33:09,468 --> 01:33:13,036
They didn't?

1263
01:33:13,061 --> 01:33:15,000
Oh.

1264
01:33:15,001 --> 01:33:19,334
May I then ask,
should we continue the search?

1265
01:33:21,659 --> 01:33:23,994
Grimsby, I'm...

1266

Just...

1267
01:33:26,126 --> 01:33:29,261
I feel a little...

1268
01:33:29,286 --> 01:33:33,773
Well, if you want the
advice of an old man, sire,

1269
01:33:33,798 --> 01:33:37,240
don't be held back by
what you think should be.

1270
01:33:37,265 --> 01:33:40,620
Think only of what is.

1271
01:33:40,645 --> 01:33:41,806

- Oh, yes.

1325
01:38:23,026 --> 01:38:26,103
I must admit,
I was mistaken.

1326
01:38:26,529 --> 01:38:30,462
It seems you really have found
the girl of your dreams, after all.

1327
01:38:30,487 --> 01:38:33,235
Yes...
Quite the surprise, Eric.

1328
01:38:34,148 --> 01:38:35,508
What?

1329
01:38:35,533 --> 01:38:37,434
Oh, I know.

1330
01:38:37,459 --> 01:38:39,860
I know it must seem fast, but...

1331
01:38:39,885 --> 01:38:41,770
But I do owe her my life.

1332
01:38:41,795 --> 01:38:44,232
We will celebrate, this evening.

1333
01:38:44,257 --> 01:38:47,345
You shall introduce
your intended to the court.

1334
01:38:47,370 --> 01:38:49,393
We can make that happen,
can't we, Grimsby?

1335
01:38:49,418 --> 01:38:52,778
Yes...
If it's really what you want, Eric.

1336
01:38:53,831 --> 01:38:56,000
What I... want?

1337
01:38:57,371 --> 01:39:01,492
It's...
It's what we both want.

1338
01:39:01,517 --> 01:39:03,043
Lovely.

1339
01:39:03,068 --> 01:39:06,401
- Well, we've got our work cut out for us.
- Indeed.

1340
01:39:06,426 --> 01:39:09,479
- Then let's begin preparations.
- Straight away.

1341
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:17,051
Oh, Ariel, girl...
Where have you gone?

1342
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,899
- Hey, any sign of her?
- No luck.

1343
01:39:18,924 --> 01:39:20,901
I flew over the village three times.

1344
01:39:20,926 --> 01:39:22,419
What?
Check the castle again.

1345
01:39:22,444 --> 01:39:24,874
It's almost sunset.
We've got to find her.

1346
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:27,652
- Copy that.
- What's wrong with that fool, Prince?

1347
01:39:27,677 --> 01:39:29,213
Something fishy going on here.

1348
01:39:29,238 --> 01:39:31,100
- I don't like the smell... eh?
- Sebastian, over here.

1349
01:39:31,125 --> 01:39:33,260
Yes, I'm coming, I'm coming.
Hold on.

1350
01:39:33,285 --> 01:39:34,266
Yes, what?

1351
01:39:34,291 --> 01:39:36,126
- I think I know where Ariel is.
- What?

1352
01:39:36,151 --> 01:39:39,000
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1353
01:39:48,366 --> 01:39:50,080
Ariel?

1354
01:40:22,226 --> 01:40:24,400
So long, Red.

1355
01:40:32,401 --> 01:40:33,545

1366
01:41:53,308 --> 01:41:56,501
This all has to be some sort
of misunderstanding.

1367
01:41:56,526 --> 01:41:59,661
I watched both of you,
you're meant to be together.

1368
01:41:59,686 --> 01:42:01,689
There you are,
I've been looking.

1369
01:42:01,714 --> 01:42:07,684
And I thought I found you 'cause I heard,
but then I saw it wasn't you, it was her.

1370
01:42:07,709 --> 01:42:11,514
But it wasn't in the mirror,
except she had your voice.

1371
01:42:11,539 --> 01:42:13,000
What are you talking about?

1372
01:42:13,001 --> 01:42:16,000
- Don't you get what I'm telling you?!
- No!

1373
01:42:16,001 --> 01:42:17,687
The Prince has been tricked.

1374
01:42:17,712 --> 01:42:21,260
That lady who showed up is
actually the sea witch in disguise.

1375
01:42:21,285 --> 01:42:24,371
- What? Are you sure about this?
- Of course, I'm sure!

1376
01:42:24,396 --> 01:42:25,858
Have I ever been wrong?

1377
01:42:25,883 --> 01:42:27,637
I mean, like,
you know, when it counts?

1378
01:42:27,662 --> 01:42:29,200
- Well, what are we gonna do?

1379
01:42:29,225 --> 01:42:34,093
Well, we have to do something before
Prince Eric ends up with that slimy squid.

1380
01:42:34,118 --> 01:42:35,831
Yes, girl, go!

1381
01:42:35,856 --> 01:42:38,060
Flounder, go tell
the Sea King what's happened.

1382
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:40,000
- He has to know everything.
- Okay.

1383
01:42:40,001 --> 01:42:44,000
- What do I, what do I, what do I do?
- You give me a lift to the castle.

1384
01:42:44,001 --> 01:42:49,265
We've got to find a way
to stall that engagement.

1385
01:42:56,163 --> 01:42:59,817
Heroism's too strong a word for it,

1386
01:42:59,842 --> 01:43:02,842
I suppose I did save Eric.

1387
01:43:02,867 --> 01:43:04,568
Just what anyone would do.

1388
01:43:04,593 --> 01:43:06,688
- Grimsby.
- Sire.

1389
01:43:06,713 --> 01:43:08,088
Have you seen Ariel?

1390
01:43:08,113 --> 01:43:10,868
According to the servants,
she left the castle early this morning.

1391
01:43:10,893 --> 01:43:12,143
Left?

1392
01:43:12,168 --> 01:43:14,000
Can you blame her, Eric?

1393
01:43:14,001 --> 01:43:17,377
I don't understand.
This is not like you.

1394
01:43:17,402 --> 01:43:19,456
I'm not sure I understand it myself.

1395
01:43:19,481 --> 01:43:20,466
I...

1396
01:43:20,490 --> 01:43:22,130
I just wanted to.

1397
01:43:22,155 --> 01:43:23,701
- I thought...
- Eric?

1398
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,344
Don't really know what I wanted.

1399
01:43:39,136 --> 01:43:40,818
Almost there.

1400
01:43:40,843 --> 01:43:45,000
Now, when I give the signal,
you drop me.

1401
01:43:45,001 --> 01:43:46,187
- Got it?
- Got it.

1402
01:43:46,212 --> 01:43:48,000
No, you idiot!

1403
01:43:48,887 --> 01:43:50,854
Guess I'm on my own.

1404
01:43:54,178 --> 01:43:55,913
My darling...

1405
01:43:55,937 --> 01:43:59,299
This belonged to my mother,

1406
01:43:59,324 --> 01:44:01,996
and I'd like you to have it.

1407
01:44:02,021 --> 01:44:05,131
Your happiness means everything to me.

1408
01:44:05,156 --> 01:44:07,422
You're very sweet.

1409

01:44:15,045 --> 01:44:16,431
Enjoy yourself.

1411
01:44:19,464 --> 01:44:22,000
Oh, Eric.
It's beautiful.

1412
01:44:26,094 --> 01:44:27,240
The ring...

1413
01:44:27,265 --> 01:44:28,867
The ring, I lost it.

1414
01:44:28,892 --> 01:44:30,539
Has anybody seen the ring?

1415
01:44:30,564 --> 01:44:32,717
Have you seen my ring?

1416
01:44:32,742 --> 01:44:33,748
Have you seen it?

1417
01:44:35,101 --> 01:44:37,786
Get off me, you filthy bird!

1418
01:44:42,711 --> 01:44:44,000
Help me!

1419
01:44:44,001 --> 01:44:45,854
I'm being attacked!

1420
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,534
Ariel...
Ariel, I've been looking for you.

1421
01:44:50,559 --> 01:44:52,181
Who is that?

1422
01:44:52,994 --> 01:44:55,534
What are you doing?

1423
01:44:55,559 --> 01:44:56,939
- Let me go!
- Sire!

1424
01:44:56,964 --> 01:45:00,912
Get away from me!
She's insane!

1425
01:45:00,936 --> 01:45:02,801
- Let me go!
- Eric!

1426
01:45:05,121 --> 01:45:06,228
Get off!

1427
01:45:37,997 --> 01:45:40,255
Ariel?

1428
01:45:40,280 --> 01:45:42,131
Yes.

1429
01:45:42,937 --> 01:45:45,540
It was you all along.

1430
01:45:45,565 --> 01:45:48,779
I should have known.

1431
01:45:48,804 --> 01:45:50,779
I don't know what came over me.

1432
01:45:50,804 --> 01:45:52,063
She bewitched you.

1433
01:45:52,088 --> 01:45:53,475
Get away from her!

1434
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:56,200
- Eric, I want you to know, I...
- Just kiss!

1435
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:59,335
- I want you to know everything.
- Nothing matters now.

1436
01:46:00,579 --> 01:46:02,819
No!

1437
01:46:15,703 --> 01:46:19,000
Oh, good Lord,
she's a sea creature.

1438
01:46:19,001 --> 01:46:25,934
You're too late!

1439
01:46:35,311 --> 01:46:37,515
- Stay back!
- Shut up!

1440
01:46:39,709 --> 01:46:41,161
Eric!

1441
01:46:47,991 --> 01:46:49,104
Eric?

1442
01:46:49,129 --> 01:46:50,885
No, this is the work of the sea gods.

1443
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:53,540
I warned you,
their whole world is evil.

1444
01:46:53,565 --> 01:46:55,095
Eric, wait!

1445
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:56,066
Eric!

1446
01:46:59,721 --> 01:47:01,707
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

1447
01:47:01,732 --> 01:47:04,313
Not a chance!
You made a deal, remember?

1448
01:47:04,338 --> 01:47:06,000
Three days, no kiss?

1449
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:09,400
Yeah, is it all coming back to you?

1450
01:47:10,433 --> 01:47:12,022
I thought so.

1451
01:47:12,047 --> 01:47:15,133
Well, now you gotta live with it, toots.

1452
01:47:26,394 --> 01:47:29,343
Ursula!

1453
01:47:29,368 --> 01:47:32,151
Let her go.

1454
01:47:32,176 --> 01:47:34,000
Forget it, big brother!

1455
01:47:34,001 --> 01:47:36,704
She belongs to me now.

1456
01:47:40,913 --> 01:47:42,819
Oh, you see?

1457
01:47:42,844 --> 01:47:45,000
We made a deal.

1458
01:47:45,001 --> 01:47:47,638
In blood.
It's unbreakable.

1459
01:47:47,663 --> 01:47:49,398
Even for you.

1460
01:47:49,423 --> 01:47:52,000
I'm sorry, Father.
This is all my fault.

1461
01:47:52,001 --> 01:47:53,902
What do you want with my daughter?

1462
01:47:53,927 --> 01:47:56,882
Oh, nothing.

1463
01:47:56,907 --> 01:47:58,855
It's you I want.

1464
01:47:58,880 --> 01:48:03,767
I wanna see you suffer,
like I've suffered all these years.

1465
01:48:03,792 --> 01:48:10,553
And the daughter of the great
Sea King is a very precious commodity.

1466
01:48:10,578 --> 01:48:13,000
Poor unfortunate soul.

1467
01:48:13,001 --> 01:48:15,287
Hey!
Get her, boys!

1468
01:48:18,904 --> 01:48:21,433
Uh-uh, I wouldn't.

1469
01:48:23,373 --> 01:48:25,814
Shocking, isn't it?

1470
01:48:25,839 --> 01:48:30,140
Of course, I always was
a gal with an eye for a bargain.

1471
01:48:30,165 --> 01:48:33,623
What do you say to a trade, hmm?

1472
01:48:33,648 --> 01:48:36,297
What's your precious
little Ariel worth to ya?

1473
01:48:50,319 --> 01:48:52,519
It's mine now.

1474
01:48:58,975 --> 01:49:02,386
No!

1475
01:49:02,411 --> 01:49:04,538
Father!

1476
01:49:20,059 --> 01:49:21,468
You...

1477
01:49:21,492 --> 01:49:24,865
You monster!

1478
01:49:24,889 --> 01:49:27,552
Don't be a fool,
you little brat!

1479
01:49:27,577 --> 01:49:29,732
You are powerless against...

1480
01:49:31,378 --> 01:49:33,890
You're gonna pay for that.

1481
01:49:33,915 --> 01:49:36,010
Get him!

1482
01:49:44,202 --> 01:49:47,215
Say goodbye to your human heartthrob!

1483
01:49:47,240 --> 01:49:48,249
No!

1484
01:49:50,511 --> 01:49:51,859
No...

1485
01:49:51,883 --> 01:49:53,097
My babies!

1486
01:50:21,251 --> 01:50:23,417
- Eric!
- Yeah?

1487
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:30,507
Get to shore,
she'll kill you!

1488
01:50:30,532 --> 01:50:32,627
I'm not leaving you!

1489
01:50:45,009 --> 01:50:48,021
Yes!

1490
01:50:48,046 --> 01:50:50,440
Give me your hand!

1491
01:50:53,276 --> 01:50:54,222
Now!

1492
01:51:04,707 --> 01:51:05,847
Look out!

1493
01:51:09,830 --> 01:51:17,953
Now I rule the seas
and all will be helpless under my power!

1494
01:51:23,421 --> 01:51:27,922
So much for true love.

1495
01:52:29,976 --> 01:52:33,123
So long, lover boy!

1496
01:55:15,443 --> 01:55:18,916
You gave your life for me.

1497
01:55:20,703 --> 01:55:24,959
And you fought to get my life back.

1498
01:55:26,786 --> 01:55:29,992
I didn't fight alone, father.

1499
01:55:30,017 --> 01:55:32,892
Eric was with me.

1500
01:55:35,685 --> 01:55:41,460
All that matters now
is that you're safe, and home.

1501
01:55:41,485 --> 01:55:43,985
Where you belong.

1502
01:56:16,920 --> 01:56:19,068
- Sire, please!
- We need a boat.

1503
01:56:19,093 --> 01:56:21,273
Grimsby, we have to find her!

1504
01:56:21,298 --> 01:56:27,516
And then what?

1505
01:56:27,541 --> 01:56:31,683
And then what, Eric?

1506
01:56:33,169 --> 01:56:36,046
Son.

1507
01:56:36,071 --> 01:56:39,029
You were right.

1508
01:56:39,054 --> 01:56:44,293
- I was chasing after a fantasy girl.
- No, no, I was wrong.

1509
01:56:44,318 --> 01:56:46,514
She was very real.

1510
01:56:46,539 --> 01:56:50,169
And so were your feelings for her,
I see that now.

1511
01:56:50,194 --> 01:56:54,013
It's just that...

1512
01:56:54,038 --> 01:56:57,576
Our worlds were
never meant to be together.

1513
01:57:43,176 --> 01:57:44,855
Sebastian!

1514
01:57:49,288 --> 01:57:51,463
You gotta be kidding me.

1515
01:58:04,560 --> 01:58:07,982
Yes, your Majesty.

1516
01:58:08,007 --> 01:58:11,854
I have always tried to do
what's best for our people.

1517
01:58:11,879 --> 01:58:14,399
Yes, your Majesty.

1518
01:58:14,424 --> 01:58:16,666
And what's best for my daughters.

1519
01:58:16,691 --> 01:58:19,598
Indeed, your Majesty.

1520
01:58:19,623 --> 01:58:26,667
And I've done everything in
my power to make her happy.

1521
01:58:26,692 --> 01:58:29,646
Well, not quite.

1522
01:58:38,013 --> 01:58:41,161
She wants a different life
than I had planned for her.

1523
01:58:41,186 --> 01:58:45,583
She did try to tell you, your Majesty.

1524
01:58:45,608 --> 01:58:48,492
But I won't be able
to protect her anymore.

1525
01:58:48,517 --> 01:58:50,732
Well, it's like I always say.

1526
01:58:50,757 --> 01:58:53,900
Children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

1527
01:58:53,925 --> 01:58:57,027
- Oh, is that what you always say?
- Something like that, yeah.

1528
01:59:00,727 --> 01:59:03,423
Then there's just one problem left.

1529
01:59:03,448 --> 01:59:06,858
And what's that, your Majesty?

1530
01:59:06,883 --> 01:59:10,969
How much I'm going to miss my little one.

1531
01:59:41,815 --> 01:59:44,561
Good boy.
Come on.

1532
01:59:54,674 --> 01:59:56,801
Again?

1533
02:00:09,767 --> 02:00:11,466
Max?

1534
02:01:13,263 --> 02:01:14,737
Oh, what's all this, Grims?

1535
02:01:14,762 --> 02:01:18,750
Oh, the queen wanted the two of
you to have a proper send-off, sire.

1536
02:01:18,775 --> 02:01:22,924
- Thank you, your Majesty.
- No, thank you.

1537
02:01:22,949 --> 02:01:27,404
Much as I hate farewells,
we still have cause to celebrate.

1538
02:01:27,429 --> 02:01:31,740
Our worlds have misunderstood
one another for far too long.

1539
02:01:31,765 --> 02:01:34,813
Your marriage marks a new beginning for us.

1540
02:01:34,838 --> 02:01:37,936
Yes, a beginning.

1541
02:01:37,961 --> 02:01:42,623
Now, get out there,
change the world,

1542
02:01:42,647 --> 02:01:45,347
or whatever it is you have to do,
so we don't get left behind.

1543
02:01:45,372 --> 02:01:47,349
That doesn't sound like my mother.

1544
02:01:47,374 --> 02:01:49,636
- What have you done with her?
- Oh!

1545
02:01:49,661 --> 02:01:52,369
Off we go.

1546
02:01:52,393 --> 02:01:56,094
Have you decided
where you're headed first?

1547
02:01:56,119 --> 02:01:58,867
- Uncharted waters.
- Okay.

1548
02:01:58,892 --> 02:02:00,945
A mermaid and a man...

1549
02:02:00,970 --> 02:02:03,945
Whoever would have imagined?

1550
02:02:06,854 --> 02:02:08,758
Well, look who's here.

1551
02:02:08,783 --> 02:02:11,159
- We got you something, Ariel.
- Sure did.

1552
02:02:11,184 --> 02:02:13,505
- Something you almost lost.
- What? Where?

1553
02:02:13,530 --> 02:02:15,903
- Where is it?
- You're sitting on it, bird.

1554
02:02:15,928 --> 02:02:18,831
Ow!

1555
02:02:18,856 --> 02:02:23,161
My little mermaid.

1556
02:02:23,186 --> 02:02:24,792
Keep her for me.

1557
02:02:24,817 --> 02:02:27,441
I hope she causes you
less trouble than I did.

1558
02:02:27,466 --> 02:02:30,215
I was right about the dinglehopper,
wasn't I?

1559
02:02:30,240 --> 02:02:32,561
Yes, you were, Scuttle.
You were!

1560
02:02:32,586 --> 02:02:34,193
You won't be gone too long...

1561
02:02:34,217 --> 02:02:36,656
- Will you, Ariel?
- Of course not.

1562
02:02:36,681 --> 02:02:39,158
I'll be back by the next Coral Moon.

1563
02:02:39,183 --> 02:02:41,391
Yeah, don't be late this time.

1564
02:03:02,221 --> 02:03:06,254
You ready?

1565
02:03:06,279 --> 02:03:08,209
Yes.

1566
02:03:08,234 --> 02:03:09,947
Yes, I'm ready.

1567
02:03:49,750 --> 02:03:52,743
My child.

1568
02:03:56,356 --> 02:03:59,494
Eric.

1569
02:04:01,719 --> 02:04:05,041
Thank you for hearing me.

1570
02:04:05,438 --> 02:04:09,064
You shouldn't have had to
give up your voice to be heard.

1571
02:04:09,089 --> 02:04:13,107
