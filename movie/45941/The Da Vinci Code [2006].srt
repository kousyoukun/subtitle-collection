{3245}{3270}Stop now.
{3292}{3327}Tell me where it is.
{3462}{3560}You and your brethren possess|what is not rightfully yours.
{3575}{3667}I don't know what|you are talking about.
{3677}{3742}Is it a secret you will die for?
{3770}{3825}- Please.|- As you wish.
{3835}{3867}Wait!
{3967}{4017}My God, forgive me.
{4055}{4102}In the sacristy...
{4110}{4190}...the church of Saint-Sulpice,|is the Rose Line.
{4195}{4245}Beneath the Rose.
{4312}{4345}Thank you.
{5155}{5182}Thank you.
{5205}{5227}Thank you.
{5500}{5617}Symbols are a language that|can help us understand our past.
{5630}{5732}As the saying goes,|a picture says a thousand words...
{5740}{5810}...but which words?
{5830}{5915}Interpret for me, please, this symbol.|First thing that comes to mind.
{5920}{5975}- Hatred, racism.|- Ku Klux Klan.
{5980}{6105}Yes, yes, interesting. But they would|disagree with you in Spain.
{6115}{6192}There, they are robes|worn by priests.
{6202}{6250}Now this symbol. Anyone?
{6260}{6282}Evil.
{6315}{6340}In English, please.
{6345}{6370}Devil's pitchfork.
{6375}{6427}Poor, poor Poseidon.
{6440}{6565}That is his trident. A symbol of power|to millions of the ancients.
{6570}{6597}Now this symbol.
{6622}{6682}- Madonna and child.|- Faith. Christianity.
{6687}{6777}No. No, it's the pagan god|Horus and his mother, Isis...
{6782}{6842}...centuries before|the birth of Christ.
{6847}{6937}Understanding our past|determines actively...
{6942}{7015}...our ability to understand|the present.
{7022}{7130}So how do we sift truth from belief?
{7137}{7222}How do we write our own histories,|personally or culturally...
{7227}{7277}...and thereby define ourselves?
{7282}{7385}How do we penetrate years,|centuries, of historical distortion...
{7397}{7462}...to find original truth?
{7470}{7545}Tonight, this will be our quest.
{7550}{7622}My son is a student|of yours at Harvard.
{7627}{7680}- Michael Culp? He adores you.|- Oh, yeah.
{7685}{7732}He says you're the best teacher|he's ever had.
{7740}{7832}Ms. Culp, I think I already gave|Michael an A-minus.
{7840}{7872}He told me. Thank you.
{7877}{7907}Mr. Langdon?
{7925}{7957}Hi.
{7965}{7992}Bonjour, professor.
{8015}{8142}I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.|A kind of French FBI.
{8155}{8217}Will you take a look|at this photo, please?
{8222}{8290}My police chief, Capitaine Fache,|had hoped...
{8295}{8380}...considering your expertise|and the markings on the body...
{8385}{8420}...you might assist us.
{8630}{8680}Will you excuse me a moment?
{8760}{8802}I was supposed to have|drinks with him.
{8807}{8835}Yes, we know.
{8867}{8917}We found your name|in his daily planner.
{8947}{9012}He never showed.|I waited for over an hour.
{9090}{9155}Why would someone do this to him?
{9160}{9232}Oh, you misunderstand, professor.
{9242}{9292}He was shot, yes.
{9300}{9362}But what you see|in the photograph...
{9367}{9427}...Monsieur Sauničre did to himself.
{9505}{9605}Teacher, all four are dead.
{9627}{9700}The sénéchaux and the|Grand Master himself.
{9705}{9777}Then I assume|you have the location.
{9785}{9857}Confirmed by all.
{9862}{9920}Independently.
{9940}{10042}I had feared the Priory's penchant|for secrecy might prevail.
{10127}{10225}The prospect of death|is strong motivation.
{10310}{10365}It is here.
{10372}{10430}In Paris, Teacher.
{10455}{10582}It hides beneath the Rose|in Saint-Sulpice.
{10597}{10662}You will go forth, Silas.
{12412}{12492}I chastise my body.
{13400}{13450}Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.
{13650}{13682}Okay.
{13955}{13987}- Mr. Langdon.|- Yes.
{14000}{14045}I'm Captain Bezu Fache.
{14072}{14105}You like our pyramid?
{14110}{14135}It's magnificent.
{14155}{14200}A scar on the face of Paris.
{14230}{14272}After me, please.
{14457}{14507}It's the pairing|of those two pyramids.
{14520}{14550}It's unique.
{14555}{14605}The two are geometric echoes.
{14610}{14635}Fascinating.
{14700}{14782}I'm not sure how much help|I'm gonna be here this evening.
{14805}{14865}How well did you know the curator?
{14870}{14897}Not very well.
{14902}{14987}Frankly, I was surprised|when he contacted me.
{15182}{15237}Could we take the stairs?
{15590}{15667}So Sauničre requested|tonight's meeting.
{15672}{15697}Yes.
{15705}{15737}How? Did he call you?
{15780}{15857}E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.
{15882}{15925}Had something to discuss.
{15930}{15957}What?
{16077}{16155}You seem uncomfortable.
{16420}{16517}The Grand Gallery.|This is where you found the body.
{16522}{16565}How would you know that?
{16590}{16707}I recognize the parquet floor|from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.
{16935}{16965}Dear God.
{17055}{17112}Let's cover the talking points again,|Your Eminence.
{17117}{17187}Many call Opus Dei|a brainwashing cult.
{17192}{17245}Others, an ultraconservative|Christian secret society.
{17250}{17315}Obviously, some people fear|what they don't understand.
{17320}{17377}Perhaps a less defensive tack,|Your Eminence.
{17382}{17432}The press continue|to be harsh with us.
{17477}{17577}We are not Cafeteria Catholics.
{17582}{17630}We don't pick and choose|which rules to follow.
{17635}{17697}We follow doctrine. Rigorously.
{17717}{17807}Does doctrine necessarily|include vows of chastity, tithing...
{17812}{17887}...and atonement for sins through|self-flagellation and the cilice?
{17900}{17997}Many of our followers are married.|Many of them have families.
{18005}{18070}Only a small proportion|choose to live ascetic lives.
{18075}{18157}- Why are some media referring..?|- That will be all, Michael, thank you.
{18162}{18190}Aringarosa.
{18220}{18307}Silas has succeeded.|The legend is true.
{18315}{18360}It hides beneath the Rose.
{18367}{18440}My part of our bargain|is nearly fulfilled.
{18455}{18525}I meet the council in an hour.
{18535}{18622}I will have your money tonight,|Teacher.
{18630}{18682}The Vitruvian Man.
{18695}{18770}It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's|most famous sketches.
{18775}{18822}And the star on his skin?
{18832}{18855}A pentacle.
{18862}{18897}And its meaning?
{18902}{18955}The pentacle is|a pagan religious icon.
{18970}{19007}Devil worship.
{19015}{19127}No. No, no, no.|The pentacle before that.
{19140}{19192}This is a symbol for Venus.
{19207}{19267}It represents the female half|of all things...
{19272}{19337}You are telling me that|Sauničre's last act on earth...
{19342}{19442}...was to draw a goddess symbol|on his chest? Why?
{19475}{19552}Captain Fache,|obviously I can't tell you why.
{19575}{19670}I can tell you he, as well as anyone,|knows the meaning of this symbol...
{19675}{19732}...and it has nothing to do|with worshiping the devil.
{19737}{19770}- Is that so?|- Yes.
{19775}{19805}Then...
{19837}{19880}...what do you make of this?
{19890}{19992}"O, Draconian devil.|Oh, lame saint."
{19997}{20072}It's a phrase.|Doesn't mean anything, not to me.
{20082}{20165}What would you do if you had such|limited time to send a message?
{20202}{20312}Well, I suppose|I'd try to identify my killer.
{20330}{20355}Precisely.
{20375}{20412}Precisely.
{20417}{20445}So, professor...
{20480}{20530}Officer Neveu.
{20535}{20567}Please, pardon the interruption.
{20575}{20597}This is not the time.
{20602}{20655}I received the crime-scene jpegs|at headquarters...
{20660}{20702}...and I've deciphered the code.
{20710}{20747}It's a Fibonacci sequence.
{20752}{20810}That's the code Sauničre|left on the floor.
{20820}{20867}Headquarters sent me|to explain, captain.
{20872}{20905}It is the Fibonacci sequence.
{20910}{20942}The numbers are out of order.
{20947}{21012}But before that, I have an urgent|message for Professor Langdon.
{21020}{21047}Right?
{21060}{21090}Pardon me?
{21147}{21217}I'm Sophie Neveu,|French police, Cryptology.
{21222}{21270}Your embassy called Division.
{21387}{21487}I'm sorry, monsieur, they said|it was a matter of life and death.
{21510}{21592}This is the number of your|embassy's messaging service.
{21607}{21640}Well, thank you.
{21815}{21867}Hello, you've reached|the home of Sophie Neveu.
{21890}{21955}Miss Neveu? This...
{21960}{21995}No. That's the right number.
{22000}{22060}You have to dial an access code|to pick up your messages.
{22065}{22090}But I'm getting...
{22095}{22162}It's a three-digit code.|It's on the paper I gave you.
{22380}{22452}Professor Langdon,|do not react to this message.
{22457}{22535}You must follow my directions|very closely and, above all...
{22540}{22595}... reveal nothing to Captain Fache.
{22600}{22650}You are in grave danger.
{22970}{23005}Church of Saint-Sulpice.
{23012}{23050}Good evening, Sister.
{23075}{23165}I need you to show someone|our church tonight.
{23175}{23210}Of course, Father.
{23222}{23262}But so late?
{23292}{23317}Wouldn't tomorrow?
{23322}{23435}This is a request from an|important bishop of Opus Dei.
{23452}{23510}It would be my pleasure.
{24085}{24157}There's been an accident. A friend.
{24162}{24210}I have to fly home in the morning.
{24215}{24245}I see.
{24250}{24347}Is there a restroom I could use? I just|wanna splash some water on my face.
{24352}{24380}Yes.
{24432}{24510}She said it is meaningless.
{24520}{24562}Mathematical joke.
{24585}{24630}Is it meaningless?
{24695}{24742}I'll take another look|when I come back.
{24835}{24892}I'm sorry. Of course.
{25225}{25277}Do you have a message|from Sauničre?
{25295}{25332}What are you talking about?
{25362}{25395}Crazy old man.
{25400}{25477}You have me confused with|someone else. I came here to...
{25482}{25517}Check your jacket pocket.
{25550}{25580}Just look.
{25685}{25717}GPS tracking dot.
{25722}{25797}Accurate within two feet|anywhere on the globe.
{25802}{25887}The agent who picked you up|slipped it into your jacket...
{25922}{25970}...in case you tried to run.
{26010}{26072}We have you on a little leash,|professor.
{26077}{26132}Why would I try to run?|I didn't do anything.
{26140}{26227}So, what do you think about|the fourth line of text...
{26235}{26302}...Fache wiped clean|before you arrived?
{26445}{26542}He brought you here to force a|confession, Professor Langdon.
{26622}{26687}He's still in there?|What's he doing?
{26692}{26772}Fache isn't even looking|for other suspects, okay?
{26777}{26812}He is sure you're guilty.
{26900}{26962}When did Sauničre contact you?
{26967}{26992}- Today?|- Yes, yes.
{26997}{27047}What time? What time?
{27052}{27097}At 3. Around 3. Three.
{27105}{27192}We call Fache "the Bull."|Once he starts, he doesn't stop.
{27200}{27277}He can arrest you and detain you|for months while he builds a case.
{27282}{27362}And by then whatever Sauničre|wanted you to tell me will be useless.
{27367}{27417}Stop it! Just stop!
{27430}{27465}Who are you?
{27587}{27627}Look at the letters.
{27660}{27687}"P.S."
{27705}{27745}P.S., postscript.
{27780}{27837}"Princesse Sophie." Silly, I know.
{27842}{27910}But I was only a girl|when I lived with him.
{27995}{28052}Jacques Sauničre|was my grandfather.
{28180}{28257}Apparently, it was his dying wish|that we meet.
{28302}{28352}If you help me understand why...
{28360}{28447}...I will get you to your embassy,|where we cannot arrest you.
{28477}{28540}Fache was never gonna let me|just stroll out of here, was he?
{28565}{28592}No.
{28615}{28702}If we are to get away from here,|we must find another way.
{28917}{28970}What exactly do you propose?
{29200}{29267}Sauničre was reading his book.
{29277}{29322}"Blood trail."
{29372}{29415}Excuse me, captain.
{29422}{29470}We have a problem.
{29475}{29545}Headquarters didn't send|Sophie Neveu.
{29600}{29627}What?
{29635}{29712}Captain, look at this.
{29755}{29782}He jumped!
{29797}{29822}Shit.
{29875}{29950}He's moving again. And fast.
{29970}{30010}He must be in a car.
{30045}{30142}He's going south|on Pont du Carrousel.
{30355}{30385}Bastard.
{30950}{31022}That cop will check|the whole lower floor.
{31110}{31165}I will only take a moment.
{31180}{31207}Of course.
{31417}{31467}He is much older than I remember.
{31750}{31832}I hadn't seen or spoken to him|in a very long time.
{32050}{32145}He phoned my office today.|Several times.
{32175}{32247}He said it was a matter|of life and death.
{32260}{32340}I thought it was another trick|to get back in touch.
{32400}{32470}It seems when|he couldn't speak to me...
{32497}{32545}...he reached out to you.
{32957}{33012}- Wait a minute.|- Professor?
{33055}{33132}This is wrong.|Yeah. See? This is wrong.
{33170}{33257}The Fibonacci numbers only|make sense when they're in order.
{33262}{33297}These are scrambled.
{33302}{33392}If he was trying to reach out,|maybe he was doing it in code.
{33397}{33442}Would you hold this, please?
{33492}{33542}This phrase is meaningless.
{33595}{33702}Unless you assume these letters|are out of order too.
{33707}{33735}An anagram.
{34017}{34060}You have eidetic memory?
{34067}{34152}Not quite. But I can pretty much|remember what I see.
{34665}{34712}Anagram is right.
{34745}{34807}"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"|becomes:
{34812}{34875}"Leonardo da Vinci.|The Mona Lisa."
{34880}{34967}Professor, the Mona Lisa|is right over here.
{35120}{35237}Look at this. He must have|thrown it from the window.
{35247}{35285}Smart to hit the truck.
{35295}{35380}What, you admire him now?
{35420}{35467}We're stupid.|Who did we leave at the museum?
{35475}{35537}Ledoux? Get him on the radio!
{35547}{35620}Her smile is in|the lower spatial frequencies.
{35625}{35712}The horizon is significantly lower|on the left than it is on the right.
{35717}{35742}Why?
{35747}{35825}Well, see, she appears larger|from the left than on the right.
{35830}{35902}Historically, the left was female,|the right was male.
{35910}{35950}There. Blood.
{36150}{36177}Hey.
{36220}{36282}"So dark the con of man."
{36300}{36380}No. It doesn't say that.
{36385}{36437}Is it another anagram?|Can you break it?
{36560}{36617}Professor, hurry. Hurry!
{36657}{36727}Moon. Sermon. Charms.
{36732}{36827}Demons. Omens. Codes.|Monks. Ranks. Rocks.
{36835}{36857}Madonna of the Rocks.
{36880}{36902}Da Vinci.
{37155}{37195}Careful. Careful.
{37375}{37465}This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.
{38422}{38462}It was Sauničre's.
{38477}{38547}I remember finding it once|when I was a girl.
{38567}{38620}He'd promised|he'd give it to me one day.
{38640}{38692}Have you ever heard|those words before, Sophie?
{38700}{38732}"So dark the con of man"?
{38737}{38775}No. Have you?
{38780}{38862}When you were a child, were you|aware of any secret gatherings?
{38890}{38947}Anything ritualistic in nature?
{38952}{39030}Meetings your grandfather|would've wanted kept secret?
{39035}{39117}Was there ever any talk of something|called the Priory of Sion?
{39122}{39192}The what? Why are you|asking these things?
{39197}{39257}The Priory of Sion is a myth.
{39262}{39367}One of the world's oldest and most|secret societies, with leaders like...
{39375}{39432}...Sir Isaac Newton,|da Vinci himself.
{39445}{39487}The fleur-de-lis is their crest.
{39492}{39552}They're guardians of a secret|they supposedly refer to...
{39557}{39607}...as "the dark con of man."
{39625}{39657}But what secret?
{39670}{39797}The Priory of Sion protects|the source of God's power on earth.
{40012}{40057}I can't do this by myself.
{40070}{40140}I'm in enough trouble as it is.|That's my embassy.
{40145}{40172}Please.
{40177}{40212}Even if we could get out of this...
{40217}{40252}Okay.
{41120}{41202}No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.|You're not gonna make it!
{41387}{41417}Well, that was...
{41630}{41677}We need to get out of sight.
{42025}{42077}Christ, give me strength.
{42380}{42472}You are a ghost.
{42507}{42562}Christ, give me strength.
{43457}{43517}Stealing in a house of God!
{43840}{43887}You are an angel.
{43942}{43995}Christ, give me strength.
{44605}{44657}You have powerful friends.
{44675}{44750}Bishop Aringarosa|has been kind to me.
{44765}{44860}I could not miss this chance|to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.
{44882}{44940}A pity you couldn't wait for morning.
{44945}{44992}The light is not ideal.
{45015}{45112}Tell me, Sister, please,|of the Rose Line.
{45122}{45247}A rose line is any line that goes from|the North to South Poles.
{45252}{45370}Set into the streets of Paris,|135 brass markers...
{45375}{45435}...mark the world's|first prime meridian...
{45440}{45497}...which passed through|this very church.
{45502}{45547}It hides beneath the Rose.
{45552}{45580}I'm sorry?
{45610}{45640}Sister.
{45705}{45785}I do not want to keep you.|I will show myself out.
{45862}{45887}I insist.
{45990}{46060}May the peace of the Lord|be with you.
{46107}{46140}And with you.
{46450}{46582}They found Neveu's car|abandoned at the train station.
{46602}{46717}And two tickets to Brussels paid for|with Langdon's credit card.
{46725}{46757}A decoy, I'm sure.
{46765}{46822}All the same,|send an officer to the station.
{46830}{46890}Question all the taxi drivers.|I'll put this on the wire.
{46897}{46962}Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.
{46972}{47062}I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.
{47067}{47137}Robert Langdon is guilty.
{47345}{47382}This is the Bois de Boulogne?
{47390}{47457}We should be safe in this park|for a few minutes.
{48702}{48732}Stay here.
{48772}{48802}Police.
{48840}{48870}What do you want?
{49005}{49052}Fifty euros for all your stuff.
{49107}{49157}Go and get something to eat.
{49635}{49682}Did it occur to you|that could be dangerous?
{49687}{49762}No. And now we have|a place to think.
{49775}{49817}Any ideas, professor?
{49845}{49930}You could've just handed me|a piece of a UFO from Area 51.
{49990}{50040}"What's the next step?"
{50045}{50085}With him, it's always:
{50090}{50162}"Sophie, what's the next step?"
{50182}{50212}Puzzles.
{50220}{50250}Codes.
{50275}{50302}A treasure hunt.
{50407}{50437}To find his killer.
{50540}{50622}Maybe there is something|about this Priory of Sion.
{50627}{50650}I hope not.
{50657}{50772}Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.|They were butchered by the Church.
{50782}{50857}It all started over a thousand|years ago when a French king...
{50862}{50920}... conquered the holy city|of Jerusalem.
{50925}{51005}This crusade, one of the most|massive and sweeping in history...
{51010}{51092}...was actually orchestrated|by a secret brotherhood...
{51100}{51130}...the Priory of Sion...
{51135}{51232}...and their military arm,|the Knights Templar.
{51245}{51317}But the Templars were created|to protect the Holy Land.
{51322}{51417}That was a cover to hide their|true goal, according to this myth.
{51430}{51505}Supposedly the invasion|was to find an artifact...
{51510}{51555}... lost since the time of Christ.
{51560}{51657}An artifact, it was said,|the Church would kill to possess.
{51665}{51725}Did they find it,|this buried treasure?
{51755}{51785}Put it this way:
{51790}{51860}One day the Templars|simply stopped searching.
{51865}{51947}They quit the Holy Land|and traveled directly to Rome.
{51952}{51997}Whether they blackmailed|the papacy...
{52002}{52060}... or the Church bought their silence,|no one knows.
{52065}{52170}But it is a fact the papacy|declared these Priory knights...
{52175}{52262}... these Knights Templar,|of limitless power.
{52277}{52357}By the 1300s, the Templars|had grown too powerful.
{52362}{52395}Too threatening.
{52405}{52452}So the Vatican|issued secret orders...
{52460}{52527}... to be opened simultaneously|all across Europe.
{52547}{52642}The Pope had declared the|Knights Templar Satan worshipers...
{52647}{52757}...and said God had charged him with|cleansing the earth of these heretics.
{52762}{52820}The plan went off like clockwork.
{52825}{52895}The Templars|were all but exterminated.
{52900}{53002}The date was October 13th, 1307.|A Friday.
{53007}{53052}Friday the 13th.
{53060}{53130}The Pope sent troops|to claim the Priory's treasure...
{53135}{53172}... but they found nothing.
{53180}{53257}The few surviving|Knights of the Priory had vanished...
{53262}{53330}... and the search for their|sacred artifact began again.
{53335}{53432}What artifact? I've never|heard about any of this.
{53440}{53475}Yes, you have.
{53485}{53540}Almost everyone on earth has.
{53555}{53625}You just know it as the Holy Grail.
{53760}{53857}Please, Sauničre thought he knew|the location of the Holy Grail?
{53870}{53912}Maybe more than that.
{53920}{54012}This cross and the flower,|this could be very old. But look.
{54017}{54142}This metal here underneath is much|newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.
{54147}{54192}"Haxo 24."
{54240}{54320}And these dots.|These dots are read by a laser.
{54325}{54412}This is more than a pendant.|This is a key your grandfather left you.
{54422}{54482}He left us, professor.
{54515}{54620}And vingt-quatre Haxo,|it's not an ID stamp.
{54635}{54680}It's a street address.
{54797}{54835}This is Jacques Sauničre.
{54845}{54912}Please leave a message|after the tone.
{54930}{54985}Please, Monsieur Sauničre,|pick up the phone.
{54992}{55027}This is Sandrine Bieil.
{55035}{55087}I have called the list.
{55100}{55142}I fear the other guardians are dead.
{55160}{55202}The lie has been told.
{55212}{55257}The floor panel has been broken.
{55275}{55355}Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.|I beg you.
{55360}{55412}Job 38, verse 11.
{55445}{55490}Do you know it, Sister?
{55530}{55570}Job 38:11.
{55610}{55662}Hitherto shalt thou come...
{55685}{55725}...but no further.
{55730}{55762}"But no further."
{55862}{55907}Do you mock me?
{55982}{56032}Where is the keystone?
{56052}{56092}I do not know.
{56120}{56145}No.
{56202}{56267}You are a sister of the Church...
{56315}{56395}...and yet you serve them:|the Priory.
{56400}{56497}Jesus had but one true message.|That...
{56810}{56875}Come, you saints of God.
{56897}{56957}Hasten, angels of the Lord.
{56977}{57042}To receive her soul.
{57055}{57162}And bring her to the sight|of the Almighty.
{57610}{57650}Welcome, bishop.
{57670}{57717}This council is convened.
{57925}{58010}Our words shall never|pass these walls.
{58077}{58117}What business, say you?
{58167}{58225}As you know, my request for funds...
{58230}{58310}Yes, 20 million euro|in untraceable bearer bonds.
{58330}{58417}A tad more than petty cash.|Wouldn't you say, bishop?
{58450}{58560}I only offer a route to the renewal|of faith for all men.
{58565}{58595}How humble.
{58600}{58667}Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.
{58672}{58707}How dare you presume to...
{58715}{58757}I do not presume, I act!
{58762}{58812}The Vatican's unwillingness|to support us...
{58820}{58857}...is both impious and cowardly.
{58862}{58960}Blood is being spilled because true|Christian values lie in ruins. No more!
{58975}{59052}This council has forgotten|its very purpose.
{59120}{59145}Tonight...
{59170}{59227}...the Grail will be destroyed.
{59235}{59327}The Priory's few remaining members|will be silenced.
{59520}{59620}I was contacted by a man|who calls himself only "the Teacher."
{59680}{59742}Two prostitutes identified|Langdon and Neveu...
{59747}{59797}... getting into a taxi|in the Bois de Boulogne.
{60035}{60082}Because of your expertise?
{60110}{60145}- I'm sorry?|- About the Priory.
{60150}{60207}Do you think that's why|Sauničre sought you out?
{60222}{60297}I can think of dozens of scholars|who know a lot more about it.
{60302}{60400}Actually, I didn't think|he liked me very much.
{60415}{60497}Once made a joke at my expense.|Got a big laugh out of it.
{60502}{60535}What was it?
{60852}{60895}How may I help you?
{61037}{61090}The door to the right, please.
{61535}{61597}Good evening. I am André Vernet,|the night manager.
{61635}{61712}I take it this is your first visit|to our establishment?
{61730}{61755}Yes.
{61777}{61807}Understood.
{61827}{61882}Keys are often passed on|and first-time users...
{61890}{61952}...are sometimes|uncertain of protocol.
{61995}{62067}Keys are essentially|numbered Swiss accounts.
{62102}{62162}Often willed through generations.
{62232}{62290}Is it yours, mademoiselle?
{62342}{62412}The shortest safety-deposit-box|lease is 50 years.
{62440}{62487}And what's your longest account?
{62492}{62530}Quite a bit longer.
{62542}{62605}Technologies change,|keys are updated.
{62735}{62772}Once the computer|confirms your key...
{62780}{62860}...enter your account number|and your box is retrieved.
{62870}{62927}The room is yours,|as long as you like.
{63050}{63127}What if I lost track|of my account number?
{63140}{63172}How might I recover it?
{63230}{63290}I'm afraid each key is paired|with a 10-digit number...
{63295}{63342}...known only to the account bearer.
{63350}{63397}I hope you manage to remember it.
{63415}{63477}A single wrong entry|disables the system.
{63642}{63667}- Ten.|- Ten.
{63672}{63732}Your grandfather's|Fibonacci sequence.
{63810}{63865}Scrambled, unscrambled?
{63890}{63920}Unscrambled.
{63937}{63975}It's your key.
{64090}{64177}Funny, I don't even like history.
{64255}{64362}I've never seen much good come|from looking to the past.
{64540}{64577}Moment of truth.
{65647}{65707}My God. I don't believe this.
{65720}{65745}A rose.
{65862}{65905}The rose was a symbol|for the Holy Grail.
{65975}{66012}Forgive the intrusion.
{66017}{66102}I'm afraid the police arrived|more quickly than I anticipated.
{66127}{66167}You must follow me, please.
{66175}{66205}For your own safety.
{66215}{66252}You knew they were coming?
{66260}{66322}My guard alerted me to your status|when you arrived.
{66330}{66397}Yours is one of our oldest|and highest-level accounts.
{66402}{66455}It includes a safe-passage clause.
{66460}{66487}Safe passage?
{66510}{66605}If you would step inside, please.|Time is of the essence.
{66662}{66692}In there?
{67057}{67100}Hey, is there a problem?
{67105}{67167}Good evening, sir. Police.
{67180}{67277}I just drive from here to Zurich.|Not French, English?
{67285}{67312}- English?|- Yes.
{67347}{67410}We are looking for two criminals.
{67440}{67507}You came to the right place.|They're all criminals here.
{67550}{67607}Would you mind opening the hold?
{67620}{67705}Please. You think they trust us,|the wages I get paid?
{67710}{67752}You don't have keys|to your own truck?
{67760}{67822}It's armored.|Keys get sent to the destination.
{67830}{67877}You mind? I'm on a schedule here.
{67962}{68067}And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?
{68080}{68105}What?
{68165}{68202}This piece of shit.
{68207}{68247}Forty euros in Barbčs.
{68255}{68280}Yours for 35.
{68295}{68317}No, no, no.
{68325}{68365}- Thirty.|- No. It's okay, it's okay.
{68370}{68400}Come on, 30, eh?
{68405}{68437}I said, no!
{68450}{68477}Move along!
{68800}{68825}Now we wait.
{68830}{68892}The Teacher will call and tell me|where to deliver the money.
{68900}{68977}You have put tremendous faith|in this Teacher of yours.
{68985}{69090}Yes, I have. And I have given him|an angel to do his will.
{69100}{69177}For surely there is no better|soldier for God than my Silas.
{69205}{69292}I firmly resolve, with the help of|thy grace, to confess my sins...
{69300}{69412}...to do penance|and to amend my life.
{69420}{69442}Amen.
{69815}{69852}The Holy Grail.
{69872}{69987}A magic cup.|The source of God's power on earth.
{69995}{70025}It's nonsense.
{70047}{70092}You don't believe in God.
{70115}{70142}No.
{70167}{70202}Just people.
{70220}{70285}Sometimes that they can be kind.
{70330}{70390}Are you a God-fearing man,|professor?
{70417}{70460}I was raised a Catholic.
{70477}{70537}Well, that's not really an answer.
{70582}{70630}Professor, are you okay?
{70657}{70695}Go ahead, open it.
{70715}{70740}Go on.
{70910}{70942}A cryptex.
{70975}{71032}They are used to keep secrets.
{71052}{71102}It's da Vinci's design.
{71120}{71197}You write the information|on a papyrus scroll...
{71202}{71325}...which is then rolled around|a thin glass vial of vinegar.
{71330}{71407}If you force it open, the vial breaks...
{71412}{71475}...vinegar dissolves papyrus...
{71520}{71580}...and your secret is lost forever.
{71590}{71637}The only way|to access the information...
{71642}{71700}...is to spell out the password...
{71705}{71787}...with these five dials,|each with 26 letters.
{71810}{71897}That's 12 million possibilities.
{71915}{72000}I've never met a girl|who knew that much about a cryptex.
{72030}{72085}Sauničre made one for me once.
{72275}{72352}My grandfather gave me a wagon.
{72415}{72467}This clearly is not the Holy Grail.
{72562}{72590}Come on.
{72595}{72630}Please, you're not all right.
{72712}{72752}May I try something?
{72762}{72807}I don't know why it works.
{72822}{72910}My mother used to do it|when I was scared, I think.
{72917}{72947}You think?
{72967}{72992}Yes.
{73282}{73325}Feeling better, Sophie?
{73610}{73725}My parents died in a car crash|with my brother.
{73747}{73780}I was 4.
{73825}{73857}I'm sorry.
{73890}{73937}It was many years ago.
{74312}{74342}Better?
{74407}{74432}Yeah.
{74450}{74477}Okay.
{75107}{75167}Twenty years waiting|for someone to come for that box...
{75175}{75232}...and now it's you two murderers.|Bring it to me.
{75255}{75292}I don't know what|you're talking about.
{75322}{75370}All right! Okay!
{75385}{75410}Right now!
{75660}{75685}Step back!
{75780}{75837}No one will lose sleep|over a couple on a killing spree.
{75915}{75950}Turn around.
{75980}{76012}Turn around!
{76022}{76062}You too, mademoiselle.
{76605}{76640}Sophie!
{76650}{76682}Get in the truck!
{76705}{76735}I'll drive! Hurry!
{77437}{77550}What happened between you|and your grandfather, exactly?
{77570}{77662}I've jammed my shoulder,|I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.
{77667}{77705}I need to know.
{77710}{77792}You say he raised you,|but you two don't talk anymore.
{77800}{77845}You call him by his last name.
{77852}{77912}You say you hate history.
{77920}{77972}Nobody hates history.|They hate their own histories.
{77980}{78025}So now you're a psychologist too?
{78035}{78135}What if Sauničre had started|to groom you for the Priory?
{78140}{78180}What do you mean, groom me?
{78185}{78260}Your grandfather gave you puzzles|and cryptex as a child.
{78265}{78357}So you are saying all this is real?|The Priory, the Holy Grail?
{78362}{78437}We've been dragged into a world|of people who think this stuff is real.
{78442}{78497}- Real enough to kill for.|- Who?
{78647}{78707}I'm out of my field here.
{78767}{78877}I do know a Grail historian,|absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.
{78882}{78957}An Englishman,|lives here in France.
{78962}{79002}Do you trust this man?
{79030}{79065}I hope you can.
{79212}{79255}Vernet, André.
{79297}{79362}It seems you're not a driver at all.
{79410}{79522}Apparently, you lost your tongue|along with your truck.
{79540}{79602}You think you're in pain now,|André Vernet?
{79615}{79707}My cause is worth your life.|Understand?
{79815}{79850}What do you want?
{79860}{79982}Your truck carries a homing device.|Activate it.
{80170}{80232}Please wait.|I'll see if he's available.
{80240}{80277}It's on the wrong side.
{80282}{80342}Leigh likes all things to be English,|including his cars.
{80347}{80422}Robert! Do I owe you money?
{80442}{80510}Leigh, my friend...
{80517}{80595}...care to open up|for an old colleague?
{80600}{80642}- Of course.|- Thank you.
{80650}{80707}But first, a test of honor.
{80722}{80762}Three questions.
{80842}{80870}Fire away.
{80875}{80910}Your first:
{80915}{80977}Shall I serve coffee or tea?
{81000}{81032}Tea, of course.
{81037}{81062}Excellent.
{81067}{81122}Second: milk or lemon?
{81147}{81172}Milk?
{81205}{81260}That would depend on the tea.
{81265}{81287}Correct.
{81312}{81412}And now the third|and most grave of inquiries:
{81420}{81545}In which year did a Harvard sculler|outrow an Oxford man at Henley?
{81727}{81815}Surely such a travesty|has never occurred.
{81830}{81875}Your heart is true.
{81897}{81930}You may pass.
{81975}{82030}Welcome to Château Villette.
{82097}{82160}The truck's signal is coming online.
{82165}{82197}It's about time.
{82290}{82327}Locked on and tracking, sir.
{82402}{82477}Very good. Tell Collet not to move in|until I get there.
{82490}{82597}Attention! All of Collet's units|to Château Villette.
{82622}{82700}The suspects Neveu and Langdon|are likely at that location.
{83097}{83127}Aringarosa.
{83390}{83462}I still don't know why|he put you into this...
{83480}{83525}...and I'm sorry.
{83650}{83677}But...
{83697}{83740}...I'm also very glad.
{84180}{84242}You are requested|to make yourself at home.
{84442}{84470}Robert!
{84495}{84557}And you travel with a maiden,|it seems.
{84562}{84640}Sir Leigh Teabing,|may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.
{84645}{84695}Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.
{84700}{84792}It's an honor to welcome you...
{84807}{84857}...even though it's late.
{84865}{84955}Thank you for having us.|I realize it's quite late.
{84987}{85057}So late, mademoiselle,|it's almost early.
{85122}{85160}What a lovely smile you have.
{85210}{85232}Earl Grey?
{85257}{85282}Lemon.
{85300}{85327}Correct.
{85825}{85877}Château Villette. Yes.
{85920}{85970}A dramatic late-night arrival.
{85975}{86037}What can an old cripple|do for you, Robert?
{86062}{86150}We wanna talk about|the Priory of Sion.
{86160}{86190}The keepers?
{86212}{86245}The secret war?
{86250}{86297}Sorry for all the mystery.
{86315}{86387}Leigh, I'm into something here|that I cannot understand.
{86397}{86422}You?
{86445}{86525}- Really?|- Not without your help.
{86535}{86607}Playing to my vanity, Robert.|You should be ashamed.
{86615}{86642}Not if it works.
{86705}{86757}There are always four:
{86775}{86850}The Grand Master|and the three sénéchaux...
{86855}{86937}...make up the primary|guardians of the Grail.
{86982}{87025}Thank you, Remy.|That'll be all for now.
{87187}{87267}The Priory's members|span our very globe itself.
{87275}{87380}Philippe de Chérisey|exposed that as a hoax in 1967.
{87385}{87430}And that is what|they want you to believe.
{87450}{87517}The Priory is charged|with a single task:
{87522}{87602}To protect the greatest secret|in modern history.
{87607}{87667}The source of God's power|on earth.
{87672}{87710}No, that's a common|misunderstanding.
{87715}{87832}The Priory protects the source|of the Church's power on earth:
{87850}{87882}The Holy Grail.
{87895}{87932}I don't understand.
{87940}{88037}What power? Some magic dishes?
{88055}{88152}Robert. Has he been telling you|that the Holy Grail is a cup?
{88500}{88590}The Good Book did not arrive|by facsimile from heaven.
{88610}{88717}The Bible as we know it|was finally presided over by one man:
{88722}{88762}The pagan emperor Constantine.
{88775}{88822}I thought Constantine|was a Christian.
{88830}{88900}Oh, hardly, no.|He was a lifelong pagan...
{88905}{88967}...who was baptized|on his deathbed.
{88972}{89052}Constantine was Rome's|supreme holy man.
{89060}{89097}From time immemorial...
{89102}{89207}... his people had worshiped a balance|between nature's male deities...
{89212}{89297}...and the goddess,|or sacred feminine.
{89317}{89402}But a growing religious turmoil|was gripping Rome.
{89417}{89462}Three centuries earlier...
{89467}{89537}...a young Jew named Jesus|had come along...
{89542}{89597}...preaching love and a single God.
{89602}{89677}Centuries after his crucifixion...
{89690}{89755}... Christ's followers|had grown exponentially...
{89760}{89822}... and had started a religious war|against the pagans.
{89945}{90025}Or did the pagans commence war|against the Christians?
{90042}{90117}Leigh, we can't be sure who began|the atrocities in that period.
{90125}{90192}We can at least agree that the|conflict grew to such proportions...
{90200}{90260}...that it threatened|to tear Rome in two.
{90265}{90342}So Constantine may have been|a lifelong pagan...
{90350}{90392}...but he was also a pragmatist.
{90397}{90447}And in 325 anno Domini...
{90455}{90575}...he decided to unify Rome under|a single religion, Christianity.
{90580}{90680}Christianity was on the rise.|He didn't want his empire torn apart.
{90685}{90762}And to strengthen this new|Christian tradition...
{90767}{90822}...Constantine held|a famous ecumenical gathering...
{90827}{90895}...known as the Council of Nicaea.
{90900}{90935}And at this council...
{90940}{91057}... the many sects of Christianity|debated and voted on, well...
{91062}{91155}... everything, from the acceptance|and rejection of specific gospels...
{91160}{91197}... to the date for Easter...
{91202}{91275}...to the administering|of the sacraments, and of course...
{91280}{91327}...the immortality of Jesus.
{91342}{91370}I don't follow.
{91382}{91442}Well, ma chčre,|until that moment in history...
{91460}{91567}...Jesus was viewed by many of his|followers as a mighty prophet...
{91575}{91662}...as a great and powerful man,|but a man nevertheless.
{91677}{91722}A mortal man.
{91727}{91757}Not the Son of God?
{91762}{91820}Not even his nephew twice removed.
{91825}{91907}Constantine did not create|Jesus' divinity.
{91915}{92007}He simply sanctioned|an already widely held idea.
{92015}{92052}- Semantics.|- No, it's not semantics.
{92057}{92130}You're interpreting facts|to support your own conclusions.
{92135}{92247}Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was|mortal one day and divine the next.
{92255}{92302}For some Christians,|his divinity was enhanced.
{92307}{92365}Absurd. There was a formal|announcement of his promotion.
{92370}{92417}They couldn't even agree|on the Nicene Creed!
{92422}{92505}Excuse me.|"Who is God, who is man?"
{92610}{92677}How many have been murdered|over this question?
{92697}{92767}As long as there has been|a one true God...
{92772}{92822}...there has been killing|in his name.
{93030}{93092}Now let me show you the Grail.
{93155}{93220}I trust you recognize|The Last Supper...
{93232}{93327}...the great fresco by|Leonardo da Vinci.
{93385}{93447}Now, my dear,|if you would close your eyes.
{93455}{93507}Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.
{93512}{93567}You asked for my help, I recall.
{93572}{93635}Allow an old man his indulgences.
{93740}{93820}Now, mademoiselle,|where is Jesus sitting?
{93835}{93875}- In the middle.|- Good.
{93880}{93947}He and his disciples|are breaking bread.
{93955}{94010}And what drink?
{94020}{94065}Wine. They drank wine.
{94070}{94125}Splendid. And one final question:
{94130}{94202}How many wineglasses|are there on the table?
{94235}{94280}One? The Holy Grail?
{94285}{94307}Open your eyes.
{94380}{94420}No single cup.
{94435}{94462}No chalice.
{94467}{94532}Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?
{94540}{94612}Considering both the Bible|and standard Grail legend...
{94617}{94720}...celebrate this moment as the|definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.
{94787}{94847}Now, Robert,|you could be of help to us.
{94852}{94945}If you'd be so kind as to show us the|symbols for man and woman, please.
{94950}{95040}No balloon animals.|I can make a great duck.
{95112}{95212}This is the original icon for male.|It's a rudimentary phallus.
{95217}{95267}- Quite to the point.|- Yes, indeed.
{95272}{95322}This is known as the blade.
{95327}{95372}It represents aggression|and manhood.
{95377}{95442}It's a symbol still used today|in modern military uniforms.
{95447}{95545}Yes, the more penises you have, the|higher your rank. Boys will be boys.
{95550}{95652}Now, as you would imagine, the|female symbol is its exact opposite.
{95657}{95692}This is called the chalice.
{95697}{95812}And the chalice resembles a cup|or vessel or, more importantly...
{95817}{95867}...the shape of a woman's womb.
{95897}{95967}No, the Grail has never been a cup.
{95975}{96092}It is quite literally this ancient|symbol of womanhood.
{96120}{96242}And in this case, a woman who|carried a secret so powerful...
{96247}{96350}...that if revealed, it would devastate|the very foundations of Christianity.
{96355}{96385}Wait, please.
{96390}{96500}You're saying the Holy Grail|is a person? A woman?
{96520}{96615}And it turns out, she makes|an appearance right there.
{96630}{96667}But they are all men.
{96675}{96700}Are they?
{96705}{96762}What about that figure|on the right hand of our Lord...
{96767}{96832}...seated in the place of honor?
{96852}{96897}Flowing red hair.
{96925}{96977}Folded feminine hands.
{97007}{97065}Hint of a bosom. No?
{97197}{97277}It's called scotoma.|The mind sees what it chooses to see.
{97285}{97317}Who is she?
{97350}{97392}My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.
{97405}{97427}The prostitute?
{97452}{97487}She was no such thing.
{97497}{97607}Smeared by the Church|in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.
{97665}{97732}Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.
{97902}{97947}This is an old wives' tale.
{97955}{97987}The original one, in fact.
{97992}{98042}There's virtually no empirical proof.
{98047}{98122}He knows as well as I do|there's much evidence to support it.
{98130}{98167}Theories. There are theories.
{98175}{98250}Notice how Jesus and Mary|are clothed.
{98285}{98332}Mirror images of each other.
{98337}{98397}The mind sees|what it chooses to see.
{98402}{98507}And venturing into the even more|bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...
{98512}{98597}...appear to be joined at the hip and|are leaning away from each other...
{98602}{98710}...as if to create a shape in the|negative space between them.
{98735}{98815}Leonardo gives us the chalice.
{98875}{98937}Yes. Oh, and Robert,|notice what happens...
{98942}{99017}...when these two figures|change position.
{99040}{99117}Just because da Vinci painted it|doesn't make it true.
{99122}{99167}No. But history...
{99177}{99220}...she does make it true.
{99225}{99302}Now, listen to this. It's from|the Gospel according to Philip.
{99307}{99332}Philip?
{99337}{99405}Yes, it was rejected|at the Council of Nicaea...
{99410}{99457}...along with any other gospels|that made...
{99462}{99522}...Jesus appear human|and not divine.
{99527}{99645}"And the companion of the Savior|is Mary Magdalene.
{99655}{99742}Christ loved her more|than all the disciples...
{99747}{99792}...and used to kiss her on the..."
{99797}{99842}But this says nothing of marriage.
{99847}{99910}Well, actually...
{99915}{99940}Robert.
{99955}{100067}Actually, in those days, the word|"companion" literally meant "spouse."
{100072}{100177}And this is from the Gospel|of Mary Magdalene herself.
{100182}{100247}- She wrote a gospel?|- She may have.
{100252}{100322}- Robert, will you fight fair?|- She may have.
{100327}{100422}"And Peter said,|'Did he prefer her to us?'
{100445}{100475}And Levi answered:
{100480}{100577}'Peter, I see you contending|against a woman like an adversary.
{100585}{100690}If the Savior made her worthy,|who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'
{100695}{100802}Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus|goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...
{100807}{100900}...that it's up to her|to continue his Church.
{100927}{100990}Mary Magdalene, not Peter.
{101010}{101102}The Church was supposed|to be carried on by a woman.
{101112}{101225}Few realize that Mary was descended|from kings, just as her husband was.
{101240}{101365}Now, my dear, the word|in French for Holy Grail.
{101400}{101475}From the Middle English|"Sangreal"...
{101480}{101542}...of the original Arthurian legend.
{101547}{101670}Now, as two words.|Can you translate for our friend?
{101710}{101792}Sang real, it means "royal blood."
{101810}{101912}When the legend speaks of the|chalice that held the blood of Christ...
{101925}{102052}...it speaks in fact of the female womb|that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.
{102077}{102145}But how could Christ|have a bloodline, unless..?
{102150}{102217}Mary was pregnant|at the time of the Crucifixion.
{102422}{102527}For her own safety and for that|of Christ's unborn child...
{102532}{102605}... she fled the Holy Land|and came to France.
{102610}{102732}And here, it is said,|she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.
{102760}{102817}They know the child's name.
{102840}{102885}- A little girl.|- Yes.
{102890}{102940}If that were true,|it's adding insult to injury.
{102945}{102970}Why?
{102975}{103062}The pagans found transcendence|through the joining of male to female.
{103067}{103107}People found God through sex?
{103112}{103182}In paganism, women were worshiped|as a route to heaven...
{103187}{103252}...but the modern Church|has a monopoly on that...
{103260}{103312}...in salvation through Jesus Christ.
{103317}{103382}And he who keeps the keys to heaven|rules the world.
{103387}{103462}Women, then, are a huge threat|to the Church.
{103470}{103512}The Catholic Inquisition|soon publishes...
{103517}{103597}... what may be the most|blood-soaked book in human history.
{103602}{103657}The Malleus Maleficarum.
{103685}{103725}The Witches' Hammer.
{103732}{103822}It instructed the clergy on how|to locate, torture and kill...
{103827}{103880}...all freethinking women.
{103957}{104010}In three centuries of witch hunts...
{104020}{104107}... 50,000 women are captured,|burned alive at the stake.
{104115}{104177}Oh, at least that. Some say millions.
{104190}{104232}Imagine, then, Robert...
{104245}{104337}...that Christ's throne|might live on in a female child.
{104360}{104432}You asked what would|be worth killing for.
{104447}{104532}Witness the greatest cover-up|in human history.
{104552}{104605}This is the secret|that the Priory of Sion...
{104610}{104667}...has defended|for over 20 centuries.
{104672}{104747}They are the guardians|of the royal bloodline.
{104762}{104845}The keepers of the proof|of our true past.
{104850}{104957}They are the protectors of the living|descendants of Jesus Christ...
{104997}{105037}...and Mary Magdalene.
{105272}{105302}Sir Leigh?
{105322}{105400}Sometimes I wonder|who is serving whom.
{105417}{105490}His sauces are not that fantastic.
{105547}{105582}Yes, can I help you?
{105587}{105637}Yes. They're on the news now.
{105710}{105787}Living descendants? Is it possible?
{105795}{105832}It's not impossible.
{105862}{105947}You have not been honest with me.|Your pictures are on the television.
{105952}{105997}You are wanted for four murders!
{106010}{106062}That's why Vernet said|"killing spree."
{106067}{106150}You come into my home,|playing on my passions for the Grail.
{106155}{106212}- That's why he needed you.|- You will leave my house!
{106220}{106267}- Leigh, listen!|- No, I'm calling the police.
{106272}{106327}Jacques Sauničre|was her grandfather.
{106397}{106435}You're the obsessive Priory scholar.
{106440}{106492}You still keep lists|of who might be in the Priory?
{106522}{106590}I'll bet Jacques Sauničre|was on one of those lists.
{106637}{106697}He was on your list of who could|be Grand Master, wasn't he?
{106705}{106767}- What?|- I'll bet he was right at the top.
{106772}{106895}Consider: Four men murdered?|The same number as the guardians.
{106900}{106977}What if the Priory was compromised,|the other sénéchaux dead?
{106985}{107032}What if you yourself were dying,|a Grand Master?
{107050}{107132}You'd have to pass the secret on|to someone you could trust.
{107137}{107177}Someone outside the society.
{107182}{107307}Maybe someone whose training|you had begun but never finished.
{107365}{107425}Robert, your ruse is pathetic.
{107452}{107485}Not really.
{107522}{107575}No, that's impossible.
{107650}{107690}Can that really..?
{107747}{107777}Is it the keystone?
{107860}{107915}I'll even show it to you, Leigh.
{107925}{107977}Will you just tell us|what the hell it's for?
{108407}{108447}Fache says to wait, so I wait.
{108455}{108550}What's Fache thinking?|The truck is here. They're inside.
{108762}{108787}Yes.
{108795}{108860}As the legend foretold:
{108905}{108955}"It hides beneath the Rose."
{108960}{109000}Oh, my.
{109165}{109200}Leigh.
{109282}{109317}Leigh?
{109340}{109362}Please.
{109367}{109415}I'm sorry. Yes, of course.
{109475}{109522}Inside the keystone...
{109555}{109590}...there'll be a map.
{109595}{109662}A map that will lead us|to the Holy Grail.
{109757}{109827}To be trained by|the Grand Master himself.
{109840}{109930}Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?|Is that how you found this?
{109992}{110060}And he must have sung you|the riddle songs.
{110065}{110102}I know some of them.
{110325}{110367}Can you keep secrets?
{110407}{110475}Can you know a thing|and never say it again?
{110502}{110527}And codes?
{110557}{110652}I imagine they lie down|for you like lovers.
{110725}{110842}A sénéchal. A guardian of the Grail|right here in my own home.
{110847}{110917}Tell him, please.|I don't know any of this.
{110922}{110990}Leigh, it's not that simple.|She doesn't rem...
{111027}{111057}Robert!
{111185}{111217}Do not move, woman.
{111320}{111345}Cripple.
{111402}{111450}Put the box on the table.
{111467}{111507}What, this trifle?
{111515}{111607}Well, perhaps we can make|a financial arrangement.
{111615}{111685}Put the keystone on the table.
{111710}{111747}You will not succeed.
{111805}{111880}Only the worthy|can unlock the stone.
{112585}{112642}Rip the gate down.
{112725}{112765}Well, well, my dear.
{112867}{112897}Sit down.
{112902}{112937}- Are you okay?|- Yeah, yeah.
{112942}{112992}- Are you?|- Yeah.
{112997}{113052}Yes, well, make yourself useful,|you French fool.
{113060}{113110}Get something|to restrain this monster.
{113230}{113267}Above the joint.
{113290}{113397}Fortunately,|a dragon most easy to slay.
{113405}{113437}He's wearing a cilice.
{113457}{113507}- A what?|- Well, look.
{113570}{113627}Inflicts pain so he can suffer|as Christ suffered.
{113637}{113667}Opus Dei.
{113677}{113712}Fache is Opus Dei.
{113742}{113812}The policeman who's chasing us.|He wears the cross in the world.
{113820}{113857}Robert.
{113915}{113992}Well, I must say,|you two are anything but dull.
{114025}{114047}Leigh?
{114100}{114145}You want what's in this box?
{114175}{114215}We need a way out of here.
{114220}{114267}Well, actually...
{114295}{114335}...I do have a plane.
{114587}{114632}- Robert! Where do we go?|- Come along.
{114637}{114680}- In here. Come in.|- Over here.
{114685}{114745}Get the door. Hurry.
{114800}{114845}Over here. Over here. Sophie.
{114850}{114880}Watch out!
{114910}{114945}Be careful.
{114950}{114977}Come, Rem...
{115167}{115197}Shit.
{115270}{115295}Easy.
{115845}{115867}Jesus!
{115875}{115897}Apropos.
{115967}{116012}I can't imagine|what your complaint is.
{116017}{116087}I'd be within my rights to shoot you|and let you rot in my woods!
{116092}{116150}Put that away. We might need him.
{116165}{116192}Better.
{116360}{116397}Opus Dei.
{116422}{116482}- What is it?|- A conservative Catholic sect.
{116487}{116532}Opus Dei is a prelature|to the Vatican.
{116537}{116615}You're saying the Vatican|is killing people for this box?
{116620}{116667}No, no, no. Not the Vatican...
{116672}{116732}...and not Opus Dei,|but we are in the middle of a war.
{116737}{116795}And one that has been|going on forever.
{116800}{116852}On the one side stands the Priory...
{116860}{116922}...and on the other|an ancient group of despots...
{116927}{116980}...with members hidden|in high-ranking positions...
{116985}{117027}...throughout the Church.
{117032}{117145}And this Council of Shadows tries|to destroy proof of the bloodline.
{117150}{117212}And that throughout history,|they seek out and kill...
{117217}{117262}...the living descendants|of Jesus Christ.
{117270}{117307}- That's insane.|- Is it?
{117350}{117380}What if the world discovers...
{117385}{117450}...that the greatest story ever told|is actually a lie?
{117455}{117542}The Vatican faces a crisis of faith|unprecedented.
{117560}{117622}I've got a signal now, sir. It's ringing.
{117677}{117790}Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got|tired of the weather here in France...
{117800}{117870}...and could you make|the plane ready for...
{117917}{117942}...Zurich.
{117957}{117992}Yes. No, we love Zurich.
{118185}{118245}What the hell do you mean,|you lost them? Collet.
{118297}{118330}You're the one who lost them.
{118340}{118375}You control every step|of this investigation.
{118380}{118437}You don't let anybody breathe.
{118452}{118515}You're acting like|you lost your mind.
{118597}{118665}What is it with these two birds?
{118765}{118832}Interpol just registered a new|flight plan from Le Bourget.
{118852}{118930}Stay out of my way on this, Collet.
{119590}{119635}Did you kill Jacques Sauničre?
{119717}{119765}Did you kill Jacques Sauničre?
{119790}{119832}I am the messenger of God.
{119925}{119977}Did you kill my grandfather?
{120052}{120092}I am the messenger...
{120105}{120200}Each breath you take is a sin.
{120237}{120292}No shadow will be safe again.
{120300}{120412}For you will be hunted by angels.
{120447}{120492}You believe in God?
{120525}{120582}Your God doesn't forgive murderers.
{120670}{120712}He burns them.
{120982}{121005}Sophie.
{121642}{121680}The Teacher will be pleased.
{121685}{121737}What will you do|once you have the Grail?
{121742}{121772}Destroy it.
{121777}{121862}The documents and the|sarcophagus, of course.
{121897}{121930}And the heir?
{122020}{122102}Will you exercise the final edict?|Spill his blood?
{122120}{122155}There will be no need.
{122160}{122272}Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,|DNA testing will be impossible.
{122277}{122342}There is no way to prove|a living bloodline.
{122360}{122397}But if you had to...
{122437}{122510}...would you do as councils|have done before us?
{122725}{122755}Christ...
{122875}{122977}Christ sacrificed his life|for the betterment of humanity.
{123060}{123127}So, too, may be the fate of his seed.
{123305}{123347}I need the flight plan.
{123355}{123380}Ten minutes.
{123405}{123460}I asked you to get it for me.
{123487}{123532}I'm on break.
{123570}{123605}Come back in 10 minutes.
{123655}{123705}My nose! My nose!
{123720}{123752}The flight plan, please.
{123757}{123782}You asshole!
{124100}{124142}It's not "cross."
{124172}{124202}"Spear"?
{124312}{124347}What happened to her?
{124367}{124405}No one knows.
{124417}{124495}Mary Magdalene lived out|her days in hiding.
{124537}{124592}And the zealots pursued her still...
{124610}{124712}...even in death, trying to destroy|proof of her existence.
{124737}{124792}But she always had her Knights.
{124797}{124855}Brave men sworn to defend her.
{124860}{124922}You see, to worship|before her sarcophagus...
{124935}{125012}... to kneel before the bones|of Mary Magdalene...
{125017}{125092}...was to remember all those|who were robbed of their power...
{125100}{125122}...who were oppressed.
{125132}{125237}Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains|and the proof of her bloodline...
{125245}{125307}...until most believed|her sarcophagus...
{125330}{125370}... the Holy Grail...
{125395}{125465}...was finally lost in time.
{125727}{125752}What are you doing?
{125757}{125820}At the chateau, you said,|"It hides beneath the Rose."
{125825}{125857}No, no, no. Do be careful.
{125862}{125947}In Latin, sub rosa.|Literal translation...
{125955}{125992}"Beneath the rose."
{126305}{126340}We need a mirror.
{126345}{126412}Backwards. In the style|of Leonardo himself.
{126417}{126457}Thank you.
{126560}{126655}In London lies a knight|a Pope interred
{126660}{126750}His labor's fruit|a Holy wrath incurred
{126760}{126830}You seek the orb|that ought be on his tomb
{126840}{126927}It speaks of Rosy flesh|and seeded womb
{126932}{127025}"In London lies a knight|a Pope interred"?
{127030}{127122}A knight whose funeral|was presided over by the Pope.
{127127}{127202}Of course, the Priory knights|were not just any knights.
{127210}{127232}Templars.
{127237}{127310}And there's just one place to bury|a Templar knight in London.
{127315}{127342}Temple Church.
{127347}{127397}Temple Church.|If you'll excuse me, my dear...
{127405}{127472}...Roger and I must discuss|a change in flight plan.
{127477}{127507}Leigh.
{127550}{127607}Harboring and transporting fugitives?
{127627}{127687}You are already implicated enough.
{127717}{127802}You and I, Robert,|have observed history.
{127810}{127862}Time has been our glass.
{127875}{127952}We are in history now. Living it.
{127992}{128032}Making it.
{128050}{128085}"Implicated"?
{128090}{128150}I am on a Grail quest.
{128190}{128225}Forgive me, Robert...
{128230}{128285}...but you two may well|have given this old man...
{128290}{128345}...the greatest night of his life.
{128390}{128417}Thank you.
{128470}{128522}He's going to want more money.
{128932}{129032}I suppose this is a new technique|for investigations.
{129037}{129157}I've lost them.|They flew to Switzerland.
{129165}{129217}No extradition.
{129285}{129435}The controller filed charges.|Ari was on dispatch. He called me.
{129532}{129607}What's going on, Bezu?
{129680}{129747}You know that I am Opus Dei?
{129757}{129795}Yes.
{129920}{130005}A bishop of my order called me.
{130012}{130062}He said a killer|came to him in confession.
{130070}{130132}His name was Robert Langdon.
{130162}{130237}He said I couldn't imagine|the evil in this man's heart.
{130242}{130307}That he would keep killing.
{130317}{130375}He said I had to stop him.
{130425}{130515}The bishop broke his vows|to tell me this.
{130520}{130602}He charged me|to stop Robert Langdon.
{130672}{130787}Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?
{130807}{130847}The bishop?
{130880}{130930}God himself?
{131137}{131212}They've changed their flight plan|to London.
{131895}{131985}I have them, tower. Relay Hawker|to land and hold on tarmac.
{133360}{133412}- Secure the area!|- Wider!
{133417}{133467}- Armed police!|- You two, round the back!
{133475}{133552}Armed police!|Put your hands in the air!
{133557}{133602}- Three men up!|- Ready!
{133610}{133670}Put your hands in the air! Do it now!
{133675}{133732}I'm afraid that's|easier said than done in my case.
{133782}{133812}Oh, good morning.
{133820}{133887}Did that old cannabis charge|finally catch up with me?
{133892}{133957}Sir, the French police say|you're transporting fugitives...
{133962}{134002}...and you may have|a hostage onboard.
{134010}{134045}I'm to take you all into custody.
{134050}{134130}Sadly, I have an important medical|appointment which I can't miss.
{134135}{134165}I'll fetch the car, sir.
{134170}{134237}This is serious, sir. The French police|are on their way. Stop!
{134252}{134330}Inspector, I can't afford the time|to indulge your games.
{134335}{134367}I'm late and I'm leaving.
{134372}{134415}If it's so important|for you to stop us...
{134420}{134475}...then you're just going|to have to shoot us.
{134487}{134527}You can start with him.
{134657}{134695}Search the plane.
{134700}{134727}All right.
{135020}{135060}I could run them over.
{135192}{135220}Bad tip.
{135270}{135300}Let him go.
{135410}{135465}The French cannot be trusted.
{135675}{135697}Everyone comfy?
{135755}{135780}Biscuits?
{135795}{135832}They didn't notice anything?
{135845}{135950}Well, people rarely notice things right|in front of their eyes, don't you find?
{136290}{136352}Do you have the bonds, bishop?
{136357}{136387}Yes, I do, Teacher.
{136392}{136470}I have chosen an Opus Dei|residence for the exchange.
{136475}{136510}I am honored.
{136517}{136630}By the time you get to London,|I will have the Grail.
{136762}{136882}Remember, if we are discovered by|the Vatican, we are excommunicated.
{136887}{136960}- So should anything go wrong...|- Yes, I know, I know.
{136987}{137027}This council does not exist.
{137050}{137092}As it never has.
{137160}{137250}Old friend. Heaven protect you.
{137430}{137477}Keep an eye out for the police.
{137792}{137855}I must say, Robert,|I'm quite impressed...
{137860}{137940}...by the way you withstood|my little airplane.
{137980}{138015}Did he never tell you?
{138020}{138100}When he was a boy,|young Robert fell into a well.
{138105}{138142}How old were you?
{138150}{138175}Seven.
{138240}{138312}Treading water all night long,|screaming his lungs out...
{138320}{138367}...to the echoes screaming back.
{138372}{138432}When they found him,|he was nearly catatonic.
{138437}{138462}Help!
{138490}{138520}It was a long time ago.
{138525}{138562}Oh, now, now, Robert.
{138570}{138675}You above all people shouldn't be one|to dismiss the influence of the past.
{138807}{138910}Tell me, why has the Priory kept the|Grail location secret all these years?
{138915}{138937}I don't know.
{138947}{139010}Some say the Priory wait|for the heir to reveal himself...
{139015}{139057}...which is especially odd...
{139062}{139142}...since legend suggests he may not|know his own true identity.
{139335}{139357}Hello?
{139377}{139440}Why do they make them so scary?
{139575}{139602}Oh, it's cold.
{139607}{139685}"In London lies a knight|a Pope interred."
{139922}{140002}So which tomb has an orb?
{140050}{140127}Two wear tunics over their armor...
{140132}{140207}...and two have full-length robes.
{140235}{140275}Two are grasping swords.
{140287}{140372}And one... Two are praying.
{140420}{140467}This one has his arms at his sides.
{140472}{140560}Oh, and this poor fellow|has almost disappeared entirely.
{140565}{140677}I don't see any orb|that ought be on a tomb.
{140700}{140765}"Ought be on his tomb."|Are we looking for a missing orb?
{140770}{140827}Maybe. Over here, see.
{140937}{140975}These aren't tombs.
{140980}{141035}- What? Yes, of course they are.|- No.
{141040}{141087}- They're effigies.|- What?
{141092}{141137}Not tombs. There's no bodies here.
{141145}{141177}This place is wrong.
{141227}{141307}Can we go now? We should go.
{141385}{141422}Sophie! No!
{141465}{141500}Where is the keystone?
{141527}{141555}Do not test me!
{141560}{141590}- Let her go!|- Don't hurt her.
{141595}{141642}Give me the keystone! Give it to me!
{141650}{141690}Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.
{141695}{141782}Just let her go, and you and I can...|We'll come to some agreement.
{141797}{141830}Remy.
{141912}{141972}Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.
{142005}{142080}Put it away. They're too close together.|You don't have a clear shot.
{142085}{142142}- Yes, I do.|- What do you think you're doing?
{142197}{142302}Thank you, professor. For a moment,|this was getting complicated.
{142307}{142357}Oh, this is absurd.|Oh, for God's sake, man!
{142437}{142487}That was satisfying.
{142492}{142537}I'm glad this bullshit is over.
{142615}{142655}Throw Teabing in the trunk.
{142660}{142690}What?
{142820}{142867}Here. You okay?
{143000}{143025}Sorry.
{144007}{144050}I don't think he's following.
{144247}{144340}They won't kill Leigh|until they find the Grail.
{144390}{144467}- So we have to find it before they do.|- I have to get to a library, fast.
{144662}{144780}He once whined to me about the|wasted space of so large a trunk.
{144792}{144842}Let's see if he complains so now.
{144870}{144915}Are you the Teacher?
{144992}{145017}I am.
{145060}{145167}Superbly done.|You've been of great service.
{145252}{145320}The cryptex has yet to be opened.|I can still serve.
{145325}{145375}You've done enough.
{145452}{145540}We cannot let ego|deter us from our goal.
{145570}{145615}I understand.
{145640}{145667}Good.
{145745}{145857}Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,|and you will be rewarded.
{145865}{145915}I will dispose of the old man.
{145945}{145982}Bless you, Silas.
{146032}{146062}Teacher.
{146260}{146300}Christ be with you.
{146365}{146487}We're at least a half-hour|to Chelsea Library.
{146497}{146545}If we're gonna help Leigh,|that's too long.
{146825}{146860}Where you going?
{146865}{146915}Getting you a library card.
{147002}{147050}Excuse me. May I sit next to you?
{147055}{147115}- Yeah, sure.|- Thank you.
{147320}{147352}That's great.
{147375}{147427}Didn't say you had a boyfriend.

{153715}{153742}But you...
{153765}{153822}You have a reason to be here.
{153827}{153915}You're the last remaining|guardian of the Grail.
{153920}{153970}Your grandfather|and the other sénéchaux...
{153975}{154022}...would not have lied|with dying breath...
{154027}{154095}...unless they knew|their secret was preserved.
{154155}{154217}How could you know|Sauničre's last words?
{154222}{154247}Leigh.
{154277}{154327}Grail quests require sacrifice.
{154345}{154375}You are a murderer.
{154380}{154452}No. No. Robert, tell her.
{154457}{154547}When history is written,|murderers are heroes.
{154600}{154647}You self-righteous bastard!
{154652}{154682}We need to just walk away.
{154690}{154732}- No, don't. Don't.|- Walk away.
{154812}{154847}I'll do what I have to now.
{154977}{155002}Anything.
{155105}{155137}Do you understand?
{155180}{155217}So now...
{155247}{155295}...can't we all be friends again?
{155327}{155357}This way.
{156230}{156317}I'm going to put this gun down.|I only want you both to listen.
{156365}{156392}I'm listening now.
{156407}{156440}For 2000 years...
{156457}{156547}... the Church has rained oppression|and atrocity upon mankind...
{156570}{156685}... crushed passion and idea alike,|all in the name of their walking God.
{156695}{156797}Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring|an end to all that suffering...
{156812}{156880}...drive this church of lies|to its knees.
{156920}{156957}Armed police!
{156965}{156995}Drop your weapon!
{157085}{157120}Stop, Silas!
{157415}{157487}We are betrayed, my son.
{157505}{157565}The living heir must be revealed.
{157577}{157632}Jesus must be shown|for what he was.
{157637}{157712}Not miraculous, simply man.
{157740}{157775}I'm sorry.
{157827}{157865}Armed police!
{157875}{157947}Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!
{158175}{158232}Put it down now! Put it down!
{158420}{158467}I am a ghost.
{158497}{158557}The dark con can be exposed.
{158565}{158692}Mankind can finally be set free,|and we can do it, Robert.
{158722}{158760}The three of us.
{159190}{159222}How is Silas?
{159227}{159282}Is he..? Is he alive?
{159292}{159317}The monk?
{159405}{159472}Bishop, how would you know|this killer's name?
{159512}{159552}Get me out of here, Fache.
{159565}{159590}Wait.
{159675}{159742}Langdon never came to you|in confession, did he?
{159765}{159862}One of your followers called you|about the crime-scene photos.
{159885}{160005}I cannot be implicated here. There are|still important works to be done.
{160047}{160077}You used me.
{160125}{160172}God uses us all.
{160192}{160227}Help me, Fache.
{160257}{160282}Take him.
{160395}{160440}- Did you get his cell phone?|- Yes, sir.
{160445}{160492}I'm going to need a trace.
{160562}{160605}Your Silas is dead.
{160777}{160817}The Priory's sacred charge...
{160822}{160892}...was to reveal the heir|at the dawn of the new millennium.
{160920}{161042}The millennium came and went|and the living heir remained hidden.
{161047}{161140}The Priory failed|in their sacred charge.
{161160}{161207}So, what choice did I have?
{161312}{161355}I sought out the enemy.
{161390}{161495}I persuaded them, the Council|of Shadows, that I was an ally.
{161510}{161597}I even asked them for money|so they would never suspect me.
{161610}{161680}Rector, I made them call me.
{161692}{161717}"Teacher."
{161722}{161752}- Why don't you and I...|- No.
{161757}{161820}Robert, no words. On your knees.
{161832}{161860}Do it.
{161872}{161905}No, I mean it. Down.
{161932}{161997}Not you. No, my dear, you...
{162062}{162120}You're my miracle, Sophie.
{162135}{162192}You're the guardian of the Grail.
{162217}{162300}All the oppression of the poor|and the powerless...
{162305}{162375}...of those of different skin,|of women.
{162380}{162457}You can put an end to all that.
{162462}{162550}You must explode the truth|onto the world.
{162570}{162605}It's your duty.
{162675}{162740}You know the answer to this riddle.
{162777}{162812}Open the cryptex...
{162852}{162890}...and I'll put down the gun.
{163327}{163375}I have no idea how.
{163380}{163422}I don't know the code.
{163430}{163492}And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.
{163630}{163682}Like your grandfather, then.
{163700}{163772}Willing to die for your secret.
{163800}{163882}But by the way you've been|looking at your hero...
{163890}{164002}...I wonder, would you|let him die for you?
{164012}{164065}Open it, Sophie, to save his life.
{164070}{164117}- Leigh, you can't just...|- Open the cryptex.
{164137}{164160}I don't know how.
{164165}{164212}Open it or he dies.
{164217}{164262}- I swear, I don't know.|- Do it! Do it!
{164267}{164297}- Stop it!|- I don't know!
{164302}{164335}Stop it!
{164470}{164515}She can't do it, Leigh.
{164805}{164847}But give me a moment.
{165092}{165132}Robert.
{165447}{165472}What are you doing?
{165495}{165522}Please.
{167445}{167480}I'm sorry.
{167725}{167750}I'm sorry.
{167822}{167855}No!
{168050}{168077}No, Robert!
{168100}{168132}No!
{168152}{168175}No.
{168190}{168240}Oh, the map. It's ruined.
{168420}{168455}The map is ruined.
{168477}{168507}The Grail.
{168525}{168550}It's lost.
{168567}{168602}The Grail is gone.
{168612}{168677}Only the worthy|find the Grail, Leigh.
{168705}{168740}You taught me that.
{168825}{168852}Armed police!
{168857}{168912}Drop it! Drop your weapon!
{168920}{168955}Put the gun down.
{169020}{169075}Put the gun down.
{169190}{169255}That one. The old man.
{169260}{169282}You're under arrest!
{169290}{169342}You do not have to say anything,|but it may harm your defense...
{169347}{169392}...if you do not mention,|when questioned...
{169397}{169445}...something which you|later rely on in court.
{169450}{169512}Anything you do say|will be given in evidence.
{169770}{169825}I'll have some questions for you.
{170245}{170335}Robert! Robert! Robert!|How could you do it?
{170340}{170392}How could you? Robert!
{170402}{170457}To destroy our hope of freedom.
{170467}{170545}To deny every pilgrim the chance|to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.
{170550}{170580}How could you?
{170692}{170740}You couldn't! You solved it.
{170800}{170882}You took the scroll out|before it broke!
{170887}{170982}You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.|You'll find it. You know what to do.
{170987}{171040}You'll find the Grail,|you'll kneel before her...
{171045}{171092}...and you'll set her free|upon the world!
{171100}{171180}That man there,|he's got the map to the Holy Grail!
{171432}{171550}There was every orb conceivable|on that tomb except one:
{171572}{171672}The orb which fell from the heavens|and inspired Newton's life's work.
{171677}{171792}Work that incurred the wrath|of the Church until his dying day.
{171872}{171907}A-P-P-L-E.
{171935}{171965}Apple.
{172312}{172385}The Holy Grail 'neath|ancient Roslin waits
{172390}{172445}The blade and chalice|guarding o'er her gates
{172450}{172500}Adorned in masters'|loving art, she lies
{172505}{172597}She rests at last|beneath the starry skies
{172637}{172682}I think I know where she's gone.
{172705}{172765}I think the Grail has gone home.
{173242}{173357}Built by the Templars themselves.|Named for the original Rose Line.
{173362}{173407}Rosslyn Chapel.
{173435}{173477}So this is it.
{173500}{173547}The gift at the end.
{173570}{173657}"The Holy Grail 'neath|ancient Roslin waits."
{173680}{173757}You never told me the joke|Sauničre made of you.
{173765}{173795}What was it?
{173810}{173855}He called me a flatfoot.
{173862}{173915}A beat cop of history.
{173935}{173982}Oh, a dumb policeman...
{173990}{174070}...who just does his job|day after day, of history.
{174075}{174165}You know, his father was one.|A policeman.
{174180}{174292}Sauničre said he was the most|honorable man he had ever known.
{174387}{174450}We are who we protect, I think.
{174472}{174515}What we stand up for.
{174800}{174835}Jewish...
{174860}{174925}...Christian, Egyptian...
{174957}{175015}...Masonic, pagan...
{175040}{175082}...Templar crosses...
{175097}{175130}...pyramids.
{175150}{175240}I think I've been here before.
{175245}{175272}Sophie.
{175750}{175787}A very long time ago.
{175845}{175887}Come along, Sophie.
{176255}{176280}Sophie.
{176305}{176332}Over here.
{176517}{176602}"The blade and chalice|guarding o'er her gates."
{176612}{176670}Pagan symbols for|male and female.
{176720}{176760}Fused as one.
{176772}{176822}As the pagans would have wanted.
{176860}{176902}We're about to close, I'm afraid.
{177052}{177107}We're just gonna be a moment.
{177470}{177500}Robert.
{178122}{178197}"Adorned in masters'|loving art, she lies."
{178210}{178350}"She rests at last|beneath the starry skies."
{178800}{178840}The fleur-de-lis.
{180065}{180090}She was here.
{180165}{180202}Her sarcophagus.
{180252}{180292}Mary Magdalene.
{180332}{180380}The Holy Grail herself.
{180420}{180455}She was here.
{180460}{180500}Where did she go?
{180525}{180580}Did the Church finally get her?
{180930}{180992}This is incredible. Look at this.
{180997}{181075}Look at this. These records|go back thousands of years.
{181105}{181175}They date back|to the death of Christ.
{181230}{181310}Good God, could these|really be the Grail documents?
{181840}{181940}What did he want from us?|To find her sarcophagus?
{181965}{182030}How was I ever supposed|to figure all this out?
{182040}{182097}When you and your|grandfather fought...
{182102}{182167}...was it something about your past?
{182212}{182252}How could you know that?
{182270}{182335}About how your parents died?
{182360}{182400}Sophie?
{182455}{182507}It was during primary school.
{182547}{182595}I was in his library.
{182637}{182672}Doing research.
{182680}{182742}I was trying to find out|about my family.
{182747}{182800}Sophie, where are you, princess?
{182820}{182875}I wanted to know about them.
{182892}{182940}But I couldn't find any records.
{182970}{183012}Not of their death...
{183050}{183092}...not of the accident.
{183110}{183165}I'd asked him for as long|as I could remember...
{183170}{183202}... but he would never tell me.
{183207}{183247}I told you, no.
{183305}{183340}But why can't I?
{183350}{183392}He stood over me...
{183435}{183482}...and he wouldn't let me leave.
{183490}{183532}They're dead. Dead and buried.
{183545}{183582}Never look for them, Sophie.
{183590}{183617}Promise me.
{183655}{183680}Swear it!
{183700}{183725}Swear it to me!
{183980}{184027}I kept my promise.
{184115}{184182}The next week he sent me|to boarding school.
{184225}{184302}One weekend|I came home unexpectedly.
{184332}{184397}And what I saw|my grandfather doing...
{184422}{184460}Some ritual.
{184510}{184547}I was so frightened.
{184660}{184712}We hardly ever spoke again.
{184800}{184922}Do you have any memories of your|grandfather before the accident?
{184947}{185000}Before your parents were killed?
{185017}{185077}Yeah. No. I don't know.
{185107}{185132}Why?
{185200}{185255}Because I don't think|he was your grandfather.
{185725}{185770}These are my parents.
{185822}{185855}My brother.
{185895}{185937}And this is you, isn't it?
{186057}{186145}The paper says|the entire family was killed.
{186157}{186250}The mother, the father, the boy, 6...
{186295}{186347}...and the girl, 4.
{186387}{186497}But your name was never Sauničre.|It's Saint-Clair.
{186580}{186632}It's one of the oldest families|in France.
{186652}{186740}It's from a line of the|Merovingian kings.
{186947}{186990}Royal blood.
{187040}{187077}I was so wrong.
{187117}{187220}Sauničre didn't want you to help guard|the secret of the Holy Grail.
{187262}{187292}Sophie...
{187355}{187405}...you are the secret.
{187437}{187497}You survived the accident.
{187505}{187567}If it even was an accident.
{187572}{187617}The Priory found out.
{187632}{187707}Somehow they concealed|the fact that you were alive.
{187725}{187802}They hid you with the|Grand Master himself...
{187815}{187867}...who raised you as his own.
{187892}{187935}According to all of this...
{187972}{188012}...Princess Sophie...
{188102}{188137}...you are the heir.
{188195}{188237}The end of the bloodline.
{188280}{188357}You are the last living descendent...
{188385}{188430}...of Jesus Christ.
{189520}{189552}What is this?
{189600}{189630}Sophie?
{189707}{189732}Who are you?
{189740}{189797}There have been many names.
{189810}{189852}The keepers.
{189875}{189910}Guardians.
{189920}{189972}The Priory of Sion.
{189982}{190110}But to you, Sophie, we are friends|of the man who raised you:
{190120}{190160}Jacques Sauničre.
{190217}{190345}He would have wanted you to know|that he loved you very much.
{190367}{190462}And that the Priory are here|to protect you now...
{190467}{190542}...as they have always|protected our family.
{190607}{190655}I gave you up once...
{190675}{190747}...knowing I might|never see you again.
{190830}{190875}I'm your grandmother, Sophie.
{190905}{191032}I have prayed for this moment|for a very long time.
{191072}{191122}Welcome home, child.
{191432}{191457}Hey.
{191707}{191807}She has some things|she wants to tell me.
{191827}{191882}About my family.
{192037}{192062}What will you do?
{192092}{192180}The legend will be revealed|when the heir reveals himself.
{192200}{192257}They just got the pronoun wrong.
{192340}{192380}She said when Sauničre died...
{192385}{192475}...he took the location|of Mary's sarcophagus with him.
{192480}{192572}So there's no way to empirically prove|that I am related to her.
{192625}{192672}What would you do, Robert?
{192695}{192797}Okay, maybe there is no proof.|Maybe the Grail is lost forever.
{192802}{192902}But, Sophie, the only thing that|matters is what you believe.
{192927}{193000}History shows us|Jesus was an extraordinary man...
{193005}{193052}...a human inspiration. That's it.
{193072}{193137}That's all the evidence|has ever proved.
{193175}{193200}But...
{193225}{193267}...when I was a boy...
{193325}{193432}When I was down in that well|Teabing told you about...
{193495}{193562}...I thought I was going to die,|Sophie.
{193610}{193645}What I did...
{193660}{193695}...I prayed.
{193730}{193827}I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...
{193832}{193875}...so I could see my parents again...
{193880}{193940}...so I could go to school again...
{193952}{194005}...so I could play with my dog.
{194040}{194117}Sometimes I wonder|if I wasn't alone down there.
{194165}{194230}Why does it have to be|human or divine?
{194235}{194280}Maybe human is divine.
{194312}{194355}Why couldn't Jesus|have been a father...
{194360}{194427}...and still been capable|of all those miracles?
{194435}{194497}Like turning water into wine?
{194507}{194595}Well, who knows?|His blood is your blood.
{194600}{194672}Maybe that junkie in the park|will never touch a drug again.
{194690}{194760}Maybe you healed my phobia|with your hands.
{194765}{194840}And maybe you're|a knight on a Grail quest.
{194905}{194972}Well, here's the question:
{194990}{195055}A living descendent|of Jesus Christ...
{195092}{195152}...would she destroy faith?
{195165}{195252}Or would she renew it?
{195297}{195375}So again I say, what matters|is what you believe.
{195430}{195460}Thank you.
{195512}{195540}For bringing me here.
{195595}{195652}For letting him choose you...
