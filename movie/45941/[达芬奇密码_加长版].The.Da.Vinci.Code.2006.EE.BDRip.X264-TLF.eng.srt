1
00:02:15,268 --> 00:02:16,360
Stop now.

2
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,760
Tell me where it is.

3
00:02:24,344 --> 00:02:28,440
You and your brethren possess
what is not rightfully yours.

4
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:32,974
I don't know what
you are talking about.

5
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,015
Is it a secret you will die for?

6
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,488
- Please.
- As you wish.

7
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:41,291
Wait!

8
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:47,592
My God, forgive me.

9
00:02:49,102 --> 00:02:51,070
In the sacristy...

10
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:54,704
...the church of Saint-Sulpice,
is the Rose Line.

11
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:57,035
Beneath the Rose.

12
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:01,211
Thank you.

13
00:03:34,981 --> 00:03:36,107
Thank you.

14
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,050
Thank you.

15
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:54,232
Symbols are a language that
can help us understand our past.

16
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:59,134
As the saying goes,
a picture says a thousand words...

17
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:02,331
...but which words?

18
00:04:03,176 --> 00:04:06,668
Interpret for me, please, this symbol.
First thing that comes to mind.

19
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,177
- Hatred, racism.
- Ku Klux Klan.

20
00:04:09,382 --> 00:04:14,649
Yes, yes, interesting. But they would
disagree with you in Spain.

21
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:18,287
There, they are robes
worn by priests.

22
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,650
Now this symbol. Anyone?

23
00:04:21,027 --> 00:04:22,016
Evil.

24
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:24,422
In English, please.

25
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:25,689
Devil's pitchfork.

26
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,059
Poor, poor Poseidon.

27
00:04:28,534 --> 00:04:33,767
That is his trident. A symbol of power
to millions of the ancients.

28
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,133
Now this symbol.

29
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,677
- Madonna and child.
- Faith. Christianity.

30
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,609
No. No, it's the pagan god
Horus and his mother, Isis...

31
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:45,375
...centuries before
the birth of Christ.

32
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,282
Understanding our past
determines actively...

33
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:52,549
...our ability to understand
the present.

34
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:57,386
So how do we sift truth from belief?

35
00:04:57,664 --> 00:05:01,191
How do we write our own histories,
personally or culturally...

36
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:03,460
...and thereby define ourselves?

37
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:08,039
How do we penetrate years,
centuries, of historical distortion...

38
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:11,272
...to find original truth?

39
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:14,674
Tonight, this will be our quest.

40
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:18,213
I still think that his whole take on phi
was a little far-fetched.

41
00:05:18,418 --> 00:05:24,584
I don't think so. I think that the
golden ratio is everywhere in nature.

42
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,015
Sure, I can do that.

43
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:30,195
My son is a student
of yours at Harvard.

44
00:05:30,396 --> 00:05:32,626
- Michael Culp? He adores you.
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,890
He says you're the best teacher
he's ever had.

46
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:39,060
Ms. Culp, I think I already gave
Michael an A-minus.

47
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:40,637
He told me. Thank you.

48
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,137
Mr. Langdon?

49
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,173
Hi.

50
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,738
Bonjour, professor.

51
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:51,948
I'm Lieutenant Collet from DCPJ.
A kind of French FBI.

52
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,012
Will you take a look
at this photo, please?

53
00:05:55,221 --> 00:05:58,088
My police chief, Capitaine Fache,
had hoped...

54
00:05:58,291 --> 00:06:01,852
...considering your expertise
and the markings on the body...

55
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,528
...you might assist us.

56
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:14,331
Will you excuse me a moment?

57
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,441
I was supposed to have
drinks with him.

58
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:20,839
Yes, we know.

59
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,308
We found your name
in his daily planner.

60
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:28,249
He never showed.
I waited for over an hour.

61
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,153
Why would someone do this to him?

62
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,420
Oh, you misunderstand, professor.

63
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,889
He was shot, yes.

64
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,759
But what you see
in the photograph...

65
00:06:42,969 --> 00:06:45,563
...Monsieur Sauniere did to himself.

66
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:52,974
Teacher, all four are dead.

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,906
The senechaux and the
Grand Master himself.

68
00:06:57,116 --> 00:07:00,176
Then I assume
you have the location.

69
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,446
Confirmed by all.

70
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:06,056
Independently.

71
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:11,159
I had feared the Priory's penchant
for secrecy might prevail.

72
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:18,795
The prospect of death
is strong motivation.

73
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,641
It is here.

74
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,344
In Paris, Teacher.

75
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:33,752
It hides beneath the Rose
in Saint-Sulpice.

76
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,983
You will go forth, Silas.

77
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:53,432
I chastise my body.

78
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:33,330
Capitaine Fache is waiting for you.

79
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:42,978
Okay.

80
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,726
- Mr. Langdon.
- Yes.

81
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,162
I'm Captain Bezu Fache.

82
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:00,596
You like our pyramid?

83
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,858
It's magnificent.

84
00:10:02,702 --> 00:10:04,602
A scar on the face of Paris.

85
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,568
After me, please.

86
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,374
It's the pairing
of those two pyramids.

87
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,180
It's unique.

88
00:10:19,385 --> 00:10:21,512
The two are geometric echoes.

89
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,688
Fascinating.

90
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,985
I'm not sure how much help
I'm gonna be here this evening.

91
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,557
How well did you know the curator?

92
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,965
Not at all. We met only once.

93
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:41,469
We were on a...

94
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,835
On a panel together.

95
00:10:44,043 --> 00:10:46,637
Something is funny?

96
00:10:46,946 --> 00:10:48,504
We didn't agree on much.

97
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,275
Frankly, I was surprised
when he contacted me.

98
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:02,725
Could we take the stairs?

99
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,574
So Sauniere requested
tonight's meeting.

100
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,906
Yes.

101
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:23,581
How? Did he call you?

102
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:28,482
E-mail. He heard I was in Paris.

103
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,352
Had something to discuss.

104
00:11:31,557 --> 00:11:32,649
What?

105
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,962
You seem uncomfortable.

106
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,710
- Are any of those real?
- Of course not.

107
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:03,650
So you know something
of security procedures.

108
00:12:03,856 --> 00:12:08,054
Well, I know video surveillance in
a museum this size is cost-prohibitive.

109
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,751
Most now rely on containment.

110
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:14,160
Yes, forget about
keeping the criminals out.

111
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,527
Now we keep them in.

112
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:26,169
The Grand Gallery.
This is where you found the body.

113
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,141
How would you know that?

114
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:34,084
I recognize the parquet floor
from the Polaroid. It's unmistakable.

115
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:44,793
Dear God.

116
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,901
Let's cover the talking points again,
Your Eminence.

117
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,970
Many call Opus Dei
a brainwashing cult.

118
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,336
Others, an ultraconservative
Christian secret society.

119
00:12:57,543 --> 00:13:00,239
- We are a simple Catholic church.
- Simple?

120
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:03,176
With a brand-new $47-million
headquarters in Manattan.

121
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:06,442
Our followers are generous,
should we apologize for that?

122
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:08,950
Perhaps a less defensive tack,
Your Eminence.

123
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,282
The press continue
to be harsh with us.

124
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:17,255
We are not Cafeteria Catholics.

125
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:19,488
We don't pick and choose
which rules to follow.

126
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:22,326
We follow doctrine. Rigorously.

127
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,866
Does doctrine necessarily
include vows of chastity, tithing...

128
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,200
...and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?

129
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:34,837
Many of our followers are married.
Many of them have families.

130
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:37,980
Only a small proportion
choose to live ascetically...

131
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,778
...in the cloisters
of our residential halls.

132
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,289
But we are all united in God's work
around the world.

133
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,290
Surely that is an admirable way
to lead one's life.

134
00:13:48,828 --> 00:13:51,353
Why are some media referring
to Opus Dei as "God's mafia"?

135
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,295
Obviously, some people fear
what they don't understand.

136
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,404
And because the war finally
draws to a close.

137
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,598
- Bishop, we need to stay on message.
- That will be all, Michael, thank you.

138
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,003
Aringarosa.

139
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,841
Silas has succeeded.
The legend is true.

140
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,047
It hides beneath the Rose.

141
00:14:12,384 --> 00:14:15,376
My part of our bargain
is nearly fulfilled.

142
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:18,981
I meet the council in an hour.

143
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,022
I will have your money tonight,
Teacher.

144
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:26,090
The Vitruvian Man.

145
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:29,495
It's one of Leonardo da Vinci's
most famous sketches.

146
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,636
And the star on his skin?

147
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,104
A pentacle.

148
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:34,932
And its meaning?

149
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,505
The pentacle is ancient.

150
00:14:39,411 --> 00:14:42,574
Symbols carry different meanings
in different settings.

151
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:45,375
This symbol, professor.
This setting.

152
00:14:45,584 --> 00:14:47,779
The pentacle is
a pagan religious icon.

153
00:14:48,454 --> 00:14:50,012
Devil worship.

154
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:54,989
No. No, no, no.
The pentacle before that.

155
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,655
This is a symbol for Venus.

156
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:00,663
It represents the female half
of all things.

157
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:04,029
It's a concept called "the divine
goddess" by religious historians.

158
00:15:05,671 --> 00:15:08,765
You are telling me that
Sauniere's last act on earth...

159
00:15:08,974 --> 00:15:13,411
...was to draw a goddess symbol
on his chest? Why?

160
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,045
Captain Fache,
obviously I can't tell you why.

161
00:15:18,951 --> 00:15:22,546
I can tell you he, as well as anyone,
knows the meaning of this symbol...

162
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:25,485
...and it has nothing to do
with worshiping the devil.

163
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,056
- Is that so?
- Yes.

164
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,487
Then...

165
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:31,625
...what do you make of this?

166
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:36,296
"O, Draconian devil.
Oh, lame saint."

167
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:39,699
It's a phrase.
Doesrt mean anything, not to me.

168
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:43,566
What would you do if you had such
limited time to send a message?

169
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:49,639
Well, I suppose
I'd try to identify my killer.

170
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,441
Precisely.

171
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:53,811
Precisely.

172
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:55,111
So, professor...

173
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:58,647
Officer Neveu.

174
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,347
Please, pardon the interruption.

175
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,526
This is not the time.

176
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:03,854
I received the crime-scene jpegs
at headquarters...

177
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,860
...and I've deciphered the code.

178
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,756
It's a Fibonacci sequence.

179
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,367
That's the code Sauniere
left on the floor.

180
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,796
Headquarters sent me
to explain, captain.

181
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:14,267
It is the Fibonacci sequence.

182
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,940
The numbers are out of order.

183
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:18,939
But before that, I have an urgent
message for Professor Langdon.

184
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:20,577
Right?

185
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:22,007
Pardon me?

186
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,443
I'm Sophie Neveu,
French police, Cryptology.

187
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,644
Your embassy called Division.

188
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:38,725
I'm sorry, monsieur, they said
it was a matter of life and death.

189
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:43,066
This is the number of your
embassy's messaging service.

190
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,034
Well, thank you.

191
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,505
Hello, you've reached
the home of Sophie Neveu.

192
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:58,143
Miss Neveu? This...

193
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,874
No. That's the right number.

194
00:17:00,085 --> 00:17:02,576
You have to dial an access code
to pick up your messages.

195
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:03,755
But I'm getting...

196
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:06,857
It's a three-digit code.
It's on the paper I gave you.

197
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:18,928
Professor Langdon,
do not react to this message.

198
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:22,369
You must follow my directions
very closely and, above all...

199
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,872
...reveal nothing to Captain Fache.

200
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:27,136
You are in grave danger.

201
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:41,982
Church of Saint-Sulpice.

202
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,853
Good evening, Sister.

203
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,663
I need you to show someone
our church tonight.

204
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,500
Of course, Father.

205
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,731
But so late?

206
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:54,973
Wouldrt tomorrow...?

207
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:59,907
This is a request from an
important bishop of Opus Dei.

208
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:03,080
It would be my pleasure.

209
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:30,065
There's been an accident. A friend.

210
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,266
I have to fly home in the morning.

211
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,740
I see.

212
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,973
Is there a restroom I could use? I just
wanna splash some water on my face.

213
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:39,343
Yes.

214
00:18:41,487 --> 00:18:44,786
She said it is meaningless.

215
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,887
Mathematical joke.

216
00:18:47,893 --> 00:18:49,724
Is it meaningless?

217
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:54,422
I'll take another look
when I come back.

218
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,771
I'm sorry. Of course.

219
00:19:18,557 --> 00:19:20,787
Do you have a message
from Sauniere?

220
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,120
What are you talking about?

221
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:25,696
Crazy old man.

222
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,492
You have me confused with
someone else.

223
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,463
I was asked to come here
and consult.

224
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,534
No, you are
sous surveillance cachee.

225
00:19:32,738 --> 00:19:34,330
Yes, and...

226
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:36,132
What?

227
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:40,243
Bring the suspect to the crime scene
and hope he incriminates himself.

228
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,469
Suspect?

229
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,707
Check your jacket pocket.

230
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,314
Just look.

231
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,054
GPS tracking dot.

232
00:19:52,257 --> 00:19:55,317
Accurate within two feet
anywhere on the globe.

233
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:59,088
The agent who picked you up
slipped it into your jacket...

234
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,591
...in case you tried to run.

235
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,797
We have you on a little leash,
professor.

236
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,341
Why would I try to run?
I didn't do anything.

237
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,577
So, what do you think about
the fourth line of text...

238
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,655
...Fache wiped clean
before you arrived?

239
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,660
He brought you here to force a
confession, Professor Langdon.

240
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,233
He's still in there?
What's he doing?

241
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,377
Fache isn't even looking
for other suspects, okay?

242
00:20:49,615 --> 00:20:51,105
He is sure you're guilty.

243
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,347
When did Sauniere contact you?

244
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:58,580
- Today?
- Yes, yes.

245
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:00,849
What time? What time?

246
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,890
At 3. Around 3. Three.

247
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,791
The gallery alarm was triggered at 8.
You were...

248
00:21:05,998 --> 00:21:07,693
- I was giving a lecture.
- At 9.

249
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:12,666
You had the privacy light on
in your hotel room until 8:30, right?

250
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:16,568
We call Fache "the Bull."
Once he starts, he doesn't stop.

251
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,938
He can arrest you and detain you
for months while he builds a case.

252
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:23,512
And by then whatever Sauniere
wanted you to tell me will be useless.

253
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,774
Stop it! Just stop!

254
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:27,908
Who are you?

255
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,452
What are you talking about?
Tell you what?

256
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,020
Maybe who really killed him.

257
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:43,226
The Fibonacci sequence.

258
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:45,596
I believe Sauniere wrote it...

259
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,671
...so his investigation would
include cryptographers.

260
00:21:52,778 --> 00:21:54,507
That's quite a leap, isn't it?

261
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:56,146
No.

262
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,076
And the letters.

263
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,342
"P.S."

264
00:22:00,552 --> 00:22:02,213
P.S., postscript.

265
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:10,117
"Princess Sophie."
Yeah. Silly, I know.

266
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,230
But I was only a girl
when I lived with him.

267
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:21,295
Jacques Sauniere
was my grandfather.

268
00:22:26,478 --> 00:22:29,811
Apparently, it was his dying wish
that we meet.

269
00:22:31,616 --> 00:22:33,811
If you help me understand why...

270
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:37,682
...I will get you to your embassy,
where we cannot arrest you.

271
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:41,687
Fache was never gonna let me
just stroll out of here, was he?

272
00:22:42,427 --> 00:22:43,724
No.

273
00:22:44,629 --> 00:22:48,429
If we are to get away from here,
we must find another way.

274
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,742
What exactly do you propose?

275
00:23:11,289 --> 00:23:14,087
Sauniere was reading his book.

276
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:16,460
"Blood trail."

277
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,194
Excuse me, captain.

278
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:24,426
Crypto called.
They identified the code.

279
00:23:24,636 --> 00:23:26,433
Neveu told us already.

280
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:30,438
I should have fired her on the spot,
barging in like that.

281
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:32,507
Yes.

282
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,271
Except they didn't send Neveu.

283
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:38,875
What?

284
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,485
Captain, look at this.

285
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,417
He jumped!

286
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:46,882
Shit.

287
00:23:49,227 --> 00:23:52,321
He's moving again. And fast.

288
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,694
He must be in a car.

289
00:23:56,134 --> 00:24:00,298
He's going south
on Pont du Carrousel.

290
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,309
Bastard.

291
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,931
That cop will check
the whole lower floor.

292
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,877
I will only take a moment.

293
00:24:43,381 --> 00:24:44,643
Of course.

294
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,519
He is much older than I remember.

295
00:25:07,272 --> 00:25:10,673
I hadrt seen or spoken to him
in a very long time.

296
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:23,743
He phoned my office today.
Several times.

297
00:25:24,956 --> 00:25:27,948
He said it was a matter
of life and death.

298
00:25:28,493 --> 00:25:31,826
I thought it was another trick
to get back in touch.

299
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:37,401
It seems when
he couldn't speak to me...

300
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,528
...he reached out to you.

301
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:49,441
Whatever he needed
so badly to say...

302
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,313
...he found neither of us in time.

303
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:21,944
- Wait a minute.
- Professor?

304
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:24,711
Come on.

305
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,642
It can't be that easy.

306
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:30,850
This is wrong.
Yeah. See? This is wrong.

307
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:36,019
The Fibonacci numbers only
make sense when they're in order.

308
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:37,694
These are scrambled.

309
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,627
If he was trying to reach out,
maybe he was doing it in code.

310
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:43,698
Would you hold this, please?

311
00:26:45,837 --> 00:26:47,964
This phrase is meaningless.

312
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:54,601
Unless you assume these letters
are out of order too.

313
00:26:54,813 --> 00:26:55,973
An anagram.

314
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,523
You have eidetic memory?

315
00:27:09,828 --> 00:27:13,355
Not quite. But I can pretty much
remember what I see.

316
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:36,687
Anagram is right.

317
00:27:38,089 --> 00:27:40,649
"O, Draconian devil. Oh, lame saint"
becomes:

318
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,487
"Leonardo da Vinci.
The Mona Lisa."

319
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:47,358
Professor, the Mona Lisa
is right over here.

320
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:58,609
Look at this. He must have
thrown it from the window.

321
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,535
Smart to hit the truck.

322
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:04,471
What, you admire him now?

323
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,176
We're stupid.
Who did we leave at the museum?

324
00:28:08,386 --> 00:28:11,116
Ledoux? Get him on the radio!

325
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:14,516
Her smile is in
the lower spatial frequencies.

326
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:18,321
The horizon is significantly lower
on the left than it is on the right.

327
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,588
Why?

328
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:23,097
Well, see, she appears larger
from the left than on the right.

329
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,361
Historically, the left was female,
the right was male.

330
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,672
The sacred feminine.

331
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,400
Why do you say that?

332
00:28:31,609 --> 00:28:35,875
Something Sauniere said
the first time we came here.

333
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:40,412
There. Blood.

334
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:53,823
Hey.

335
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,195
"So dark the con of man."

336
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,269
No. It doesn't say that.

337
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:04,806
Is it another anagram?
Can you break it?

338
00:29:09,714 --> 00:29:12,182
Professor, hurry. Hurry!

339
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,821
Moon. Sermon. Charms.

340
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:20,980
Demons. Omens. Codes.
Monks. Ranks. Rocks.

341
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,250
Madonna of the Rocks.

342
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,119
Da Vinci.

343
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:36,268
Careful. Careful.

344
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:47,583
This can't be this. The fleur-de-lis.

345
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,967
Stay where you are!

346
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,774
Let go of the painting...

347
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:12,772
...and put it on the ground.

348
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:18,940
No. You put your gun down.

349
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,175
Now!

350
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:23,047
Or else I will destroy the painting.

351
00:30:25,924 --> 00:30:27,221
Hurry up!

352
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,355
Slide your gun to me.

353
00:30:32,263 --> 00:30:33,628
Be careful.

354
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,857
I never really liked this painting.

355
00:30:56,721 --> 00:30:58,052
Run.

356
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:29,847
It was Sauniere's.

357
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:33,423
I remember finding it once
when I was a girl.

358
00:31:34,292 --> 00:31:36,522
He'd promised
he'd give it to me one day.

359
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,523
Have you ever heard
those words before, Sophie?

360
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:41,130
"So dark the con of man"?

361
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,924
No. Have you?

362
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:46,570
When you were a child, were you
aware of any secret gatherings?

363
00:31:47,772 --> 00:31:50,104
Anything ritualistic in nature?

364
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:53,573
Meetings your grandfather
would've wanted kept secret?

365
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:57,214
Was there ever any talk of something
called the Priory of Sion?

366
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,350
The what? Why are you
asking these things?

367
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:03,019
The Priory of Sion is a myth.

368
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:07,681
One of the world's oldest and most
secret societies, with leaders like...

369
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:10,383
...Sir Isaac Newton,
da Vinci himself.

370
00:32:10,828 --> 00:32:12,625
The fleur-de-lis is their crest.

371
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,355
They're guardians of a secret
they supposedly refer to...

372
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,727
...as "the dark con of man."

373
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:19,768
But what secret?

374
00:32:20,305 --> 00:32:25,607
The Priory of Sion protects
the source of God's power on earth.

375
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,419
I can't do this by myself.

376
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:39,890
I'm in enough trouble as it is.
That's my embassy.

377
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,149
Please.

378
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,849
Even if we could get out of this...

379
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,528
Okay.

380
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:24,199
No, no, no. You're not gonna make it.
You're not gonna make it!

381
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,174
Well, that was...

382
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:47,187
We won't last long in this car.

383
00:33:47,392 --> 00:33:50,259
Fache doesn't like to be eluded,
even on a good day.

384
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:52,224
We need to get out of sight.

385
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,945
Christ, give me strength.

386
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,489
You are a ghost.

387
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,133
Christ, give me strength.

388
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:11,660
Stealing in a house of God!

389
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,018
You are an angel.

390
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,751
Christ, give me strength.

391
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,377
You have powerful friends.

392
00:37:01,118 --> 00:37:04,246
Bishop Aringarosa
has been kind to me.

393
00:37:04,855 --> 00:37:08,848
I could not miss this chance
to pray inside the Saint-Sulpice.

394
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,195
A pity you couldn't wait for morning.

395
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,364
The light is not ideal.

396
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,363
Tell me, Sister, please,
of the Rose Line.

397
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:24,969
A rose line is any line that goes from
the North to South Poles.

398
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:30,079
Set into the streets of Paris,
135 brass markers...

399
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,806
...mark the world's
first prime meridian...

400
00:37:33,017 --> 00:37:35,451
...which passed through
this very church.

401
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:37,484
It hides beneath the Rose.

402
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,882
I'm sorry?

403
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:41,385
Sister.

404
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,394
I do not want to keep you.
I will show myself out.

405
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,727
I insist.

406
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,908
May the peace of the Lord
be with you.

407
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,210
And with you.

408
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:27,762
Gray Smart Car. Black roof.

409
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,703
Corner of Denain Boulevard
at the train station.

410
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,001
How could you let them get away?

411
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:36,111
Why not just shoot the damn painting?
Lmbecile!

412
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:39,181
You should put his cigar
out in your hand!

413
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:40,645
Get out of here!

414
00:38:42,853 --> 00:38:48,314
They found Neveu's car
abandoned at the train station.

415
00:38:49,126 --> 00:38:53,995
And two tickets to Brussels paid for
with Langdors credit card.

416
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,698
A decoy, I'm sure.

417
00:38:55,933 --> 00:38:58,333
All the same,
send an officer to the station.

418
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:01,196
Question all the taxi drivers.
I'll put this on the wire.

419
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,135
Interpol? We're not sure he's guilty.

420
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:08,339
I know he's guilty. Beyond a doubt.

421
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,480
Robert Langdon is guilty.

422
00:39:20,558 --> 00:39:22,185
This is the Bois de Boulogne?

423
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,226
We should be safe in this park
for a few minutes.

424
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,243
Your police don't patrol this park.

425
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,600
Stay here.

426
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:43,536
Police.

427
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,272
What do you want?

428
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:03,150
Fifty euros for all your stuff.

429
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:07,522
Go and get something to eat.

430
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,710
Did it occur to you
that could be dangerous?

431
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:33,117
No. And now we have
a place to think.

432
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:35,319
Any ideas, professor?

433
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:40,088
You could've just handed me
a piece of a UFO from Area 51.

434
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,592
"What's the next step?"

435
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,429
With him, it's always:

436
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:49,731
"Sophie, what's the next step?"

437
00:41:50,474 --> 00:41:51,805
Puzzles.

438
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,374
Codes.

439
00:41:54,311 --> 00:41:55,471
A treasure hunt.

440
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,179
To find his killer.

441
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:08,857
Maybe there is something
about this Priory of Sion.

442
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,048
I hope not.

443
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:15,094
Any Priory story ends in bloodshed.
They were butchered by the Church.

444
00:42:15,499 --> 00:42:18,662
It all started over a thousand
years ago when a French king...

445
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,303
...conquered the holy city
of Jerusalem.

446
00:42:21,505 --> 00:42:24,804
This crusade, one of the most
massive and sweeping in history...

447
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,501
...was actually orchestrated
by a secret brotherhood...

448
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,077
...the Priory of Sion...

449
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:34,342
...and their military arm,
the Knights Templar.

450
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,845
But the Templars were created
to protect the Holy Land.

451
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:42,048
That was a cover to hide their
true goal, according to this myth.

452
00:42:42,526 --> 00:42:45,723
Supposedly the invasion
was to find an artifact...

453
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,761
...lost since the time of Christ.

454
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:52,095
An artifact, it was said,
the Church would kill to possess.

455
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:54,897
Did they find it,
this buried treasure?

456
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:57,368
Put it this way:

457
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:00,476
One day the Templars
simply stopped searching.

458
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:04,136
They quit the Holy Land
and traveled directly to Rome.

459
00:43:04,348 --> 00:43:06,213
Whether they blackmailed
the papacy...

460
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,851
...or the Church bought their silence,
no one knows.

461
00:43:09,053 --> 00:43:13,422
But it is a fact the papacy
declared these Priory knights...

462
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:17,253
...these Knights Templar,
of limitless power.

463
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:21,261
By the 1300s, the Templars
had grown too powerful.

464
00:43:21,465 --> 00:43:22,864
Too threatening.

465
00:43:23,233 --> 00:43:25,292
So the Vatican
issued secret orders...

466
00:43:25,502 --> 00:43:28,437
...to be opened simultaneously
all across Europe.

467
00:43:29,173 --> 00:43:33,200
The Pope had declared the
Knights Templar Satan worshipers...

468
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:37,938
...and said God had charged him with
cleansing the earth of these heretics.

469
00:43:38,148 --> 00:43:40,582
The plan went off like clockwork.

470
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:43,753
The Templars
were all but exterminated.

471
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:48,186
The date was October 13th, 1307.
A Friday.

472
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,292
Friday the 13th.

473
00:43:50,527 --> 00:43:53,553
The Pope sent troops
to claim the Priory's treasure...

474
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:55,356
...but they found nothing.

475
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:58,797
The few surviving
Knights of the Priory had vanished...

476
00:43:59,003 --> 00:44:01,836
...and the search for their
sacred artifact began again.

477
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:06,203
What artifact? I've never
heard about any of this.

478
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,900
Yes, you have.

479
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,644
Almost everyone on earth has.

480
00:44:11,181 --> 00:44:14,150
You just know it as the Holy Grail.

481
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,920
Please, Sauniere thought he knew
the location of the Holy Grail?

482
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,228
Maybe more than that.

483
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:30,332
This cross and the flower,
this could be very old. But look.

484
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:35,767
This metal here underneath is much
newer, and there's a modern ID stamp.

485
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:37,838
"Haxo 24."

486
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,177
And these dots.
These dots are read by a laser.

487
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:47,077
This is more than a pendant.
This is a key your grandfather left you.

488
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:49,919
He left us, professor.

489
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:55,655
And vingt-quatre Haxo,
it's not an ID stamp.

490
00:44:56,326 --> 00:44:58,191
It's a street address.

491
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:04,625
This is Jacques Sauniere.

492
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,833
Please leave a message
after the tone.

493
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:10,904
Please, Monsieur Sauniere,
pick up the phone.

494
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,675
This is Sandrine Bieil.

495
00:45:12,943 --> 00:45:15,173
I have called the list.

496
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,512
I fear the other guardians are dead.

497
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:20,015
The lie has been told.

498
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:22,249
The floor panel has been broken.

499
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,920
Please, monsieur, pick up the phone.
I beg you.

500
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,353
Job 38, verse 11.

501
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,694
Do you know it, Sister?

502
00:45:33,497 --> 00:45:35,226
Job 38:11.

503
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,130
Hitherto shalt thou come...

504
00:45:40,003 --> 00:45:41,698
...but no further.

505
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,304
"But no further."

506
00:45:47,444 --> 00:45:49,309
Do you mock me?

507
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,509
Where is the keystone?

508
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:57,081
I do not know.

509
00:45:58,122 --> 00:45:59,248
No.

510
00:46:01,558 --> 00:46:04,288
You are a sister of the Church...

511
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,664
...and yet you serve them:
The Priory.

512
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:13,860
Jesus had but one true message.
That...

513
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,753
Come, you saints of God.

514
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:40,322
Hasten, angels of the Lord.

515
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,828
To receive her soul.

516
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:48,829
And bring her to the sight
of the Almighty.

517
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,372
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

518
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,306
Welcome, bishop.

519
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:34,844
May Christ be with you.

520
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:37,020
And also with you.

521
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:39,849
It's been too long, Manuel.

522
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,416
I saw your press conference.

523
00:47:43,627 --> 00:47:45,026
Very priestly.

524
00:47:45,229 --> 00:47:46,560
Vultures.

525
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:50,062
But you need a good cover
to fly into Italy these days.

526
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:55,132
So how are things in Rome?

527
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,805
We serve at his pleasure.

528
00:48:00,077 --> 00:48:02,238
Today is today.

529
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:05,338
But there are many tomorrows.

530
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:09,947
Vatican cellars.

531
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,715
1976.

532
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,882
Seventy-six, a year of independence.
How fitting.

533
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,696
I thought you'd like it.

534
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,399
I'll fetch the others.

535
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,756
Welcome, bishop.

536
00:48:50,227 --> 00:48:52,354
This council is convened.

537
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:04,298
Our words shall never
pass these walls.

538
00:49:11,214 --> 00:49:12,909
What business, say you?

539
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:16,943
As you know, my request for funds...

540
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:21,420
Yes, 20 million euro
in untraceable bearer bonds.

541
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,788
A tad more than petty cash.
Wouldrt you say, bishop?

542
00:49:24,995 --> 00:49:28,226
The endeavor is complex.
Freedom has a high cost.

543
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,433
And, of course, you will deliver us.

544
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:33,134
How fortunate we are.

545
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:37,967
I only offer a route to the renewal
of faith for all men.

546
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:39,437
How humble.

547
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:42,141
Our savior, Bishop Aringarosa.

548
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:44,439
Were we to grant your request...

549
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:48,045
...when would
this mission commence?

550
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,014
- Actually, tonight.
- What?

551
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,148
- It has begun.
- We have not agreed.

552
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,880
How dare you presume to...

553
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,820
I do not presume, I act!

554
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,187
The Vaticars unwillingness
to support us...

555
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,987
...is both impious and cowardly.

556
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:04,327
Blood is being spilled because true
Christian values lie in ruins. No more!

557
00:50:04,968 --> 00:50:08,199
This council has forgotten
its very purpose.

558
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:12,067
Tonight...

559
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:15,510
...the Grail will be destroyed.

560
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,648
The Priory's few remaining members
will be silenced.

561
00:50:27,591 --> 00:50:31,823
I was contacted by a man
who calls himself only "the Teacher."

562
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:35,426
He knows a great deal
about this council.

563
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,331
And about the Priory.

564
00:50:53,784 --> 00:50:56,309
Two prostitutes identified
Langdon and Neveu...

565
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,715
...getting into a taxi
in the Bois de Boulogne.

566
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,337
Because of your expertise?

567
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:17,973
- I'm sorry?
- About the Priory.

568
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:20,609
Do you think that's why
Sauniere sought you out?

569
00:51:21,211 --> 00:51:24,305
I can think of dozens of scholars
who know a lot more about it.

570
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:28,575
Actually, I didn't think
he liked me very much.

571
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:32,688
Once made a joke at my expense.
Got a big laugh out of it.

572
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,220
What was it?

573
00:51:47,471 --> 00:51:49,234
How may I help you?

574
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:57,409
The door to the right, please.

575
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:10,918
That was quite a performance.

576
00:52:12,696 --> 00:52:15,859
The little shit should know better
than to play politics with me.

577
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,436
I know I got in front of you,
old friend.

578
00:52:25,442 --> 00:52:27,342
I did what I thought was best.

579
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,542
So...

580
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:37,777
...now what?

581
00:52:39,956 --> 00:52:42,516
Now we wait for the Teacher's call.

582
00:52:54,971 --> 00:52:57,599
Good evening. I am Andre Vernet,
the night manager.

583
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:02,373
I take it this is your first visit
to our establishment?

584
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:04,547
Yes.

585
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:06,779
Understood.

586
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,917
Keys are often passed on
and first-time users...

587
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,782
...are sometimes
uncertain of protocol.

588
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,618
Keys are essentially
numbered Swiss accounts.

589
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:21,520
Often willed through generations.

590
00:53:24,467 --> 00:53:26,901
Is it yours, mademoiselle?

591
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,031
The shortest safety-deposit-box
lease is 50 years.

592
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,102
And what's your longest account?

593
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:36,870
Quite a bit longer.

594
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:39,975
Technologies change,
keys are updated.

595
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:44,276
But our accounts date back
to the beginning of banking itself.

596
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,853
Once the computer
confirms your key...

597
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,462
...enter your account number
and your box is retrieved.

598
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:57,332
The room is yours,
as long as you like.

599
00:54:02,439 --> 00:54:05,636
What if I lost track
of my account number?

600
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:07,676
How might I recover it?

601
00:54:09,946 --> 00:54:12,506
I'm afraid each key is paired
with a 10-digit number...

602
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:14,741
...known only to the account bearer.

603
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,010
I hope you manage to remember it.

604
00:54:17,654 --> 00:54:20,282
A single wrong entry
disables the system.

605
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,254
- Ten.
- Ten.

606
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,990
Your grandfather's
Fibonacci sequence.

607
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:36,536
Scrambled, unscrambled?

608
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,771
Unscrambled.

609
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:41,103
It's your key.

610
00:54:45,849 --> 00:54:49,546
Funny, I don't even like history.

611
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:57,183
I've never seen much good come
from looking to the past.

612
00:55:04,668 --> 00:55:06,158
Moment of truth.

613
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:53,339
My God. I don't believe this.

614
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:54,943
A rose.

615
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,620
The rose was a symbol
for the Holy Grail.

616
00:56:04,494 --> 00:56:06,052
Forgive the intrusion.

617
00:56:06,262 --> 00:56:09,823
I'm afraid the police arrived
more quickly than I anticipated.

618
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,563
You must follow me, please.

619
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,134
For your own safety.

620
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:16,096
You knew they were coming?

621
00:56:16,306 --> 00:56:19,036
My guard alerted me to your status
when you arrived.

622
00:56:19,242 --> 00:56:22,109
Yours is one of our oldest
and highest-level accounts.

623
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,542
It includes a safe-passage clause.

624
00:56:24,748 --> 00:56:25,908
Safe passage?

625
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:30,775
If you would step inside, please.
Time is of the essence.

626
00:56:33,189 --> 00:56:34,451
In there?

627
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,402
Hey, is there a problem?

628
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,235
Good evening, sir. Police.

629
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:58,772
I just drive from here to Zurich.
Not French, English?

630
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,275
- English?
- Yes.

631
00:57:01,718 --> 00:57:04,346
We are looking for two criminals.

632
00:57:05,555 --> 00:57:08,422
You came to the right place.
They're all criminals here.

633
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,558
Would you mind opening the hold?

634
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,623
Please. You think they trust us,
the wages I get paid?

635
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,698
You don't have keys
to your own truck?

636
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:21,598
It's armored.
Keys get sent to the destination.

637
00:57:21,805 --> 00:57:23,864
You mind? I'm on a schedule here.

638
00:57:27,410 --> 00:57:31,813
And do all the drivers wear a Rolex?

639
00:57:32,315 --> 00:57:33,373
What?

640
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:37,343
This piece of shit.

641
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:39,317
Forty euros in Barbes.

642
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:40,648
Yours for 35.

643
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,258
No, no, no.

644
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:44,222
- Thirty.
- No. It's okay, it's okay.

645
00:57:44,427 --> 00:57:45,655
Come on, 30, eh?

646
00:57:45,862 --> 00:57:47,193
I said, no!

647
00:57:47,764 --> 00:57:48,890
Move along!

648
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:03,403
Now we wait.

649
00:58:03,613 --> 00:58:06,207
The Teacher will call and tell me
where to deliver the money.

650
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,783
You have put tremendous faith
in this Teacher of yours.

651
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:14,389
Yes, I have. And I have given him
an angel to do his will.

652
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:18,124
For surely there is no better
soldier for God than my Silas.

653
00:58:19,095 --> 00:58:22,758
I firmly resolve, with the help of
thy grace, to confess my sins...

654
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,573
...to do penance
and to amend my life.

655
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:40,983
Amen.

656
00:59:01,271 --> 00:59:03,637
I chastise my body.

657
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:21,281
The Holy Grail.

658
00:59:22,091 --> 00:59:26,926
A magic cup.
The source of God's power on earth.

659
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:28,427
It's nonsense.

660
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,333
You don't believe in God.

661
00:59:32,201 --> 00:59:33,327
No.

662
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:39,598
I don't believe in some magic
from the sky.

663
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,299
Just people.

664
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,538
Sometimes that they can be kind.

665
00:59:45,448 --> 00:59:46,676
And that's enough?

666
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:50,383
Well, I think it has to be.
I think it's all we have.

667
00:59:52,989 --> 00:59:55,549
Are you a God-fearing man,
professor?

668
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,456
I was raised a Catholic.

669
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:01,722
Well, that's not really an answer.

670
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,534
Professor, are you okay?

671
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:08,295
Go ahead, open it.

672
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:10,129
Go on.

673
01:00:17,246 --> 01:00:18,577
A cryptex.

674
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,407
They are used to keep secrets.

675
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,313
It's da Vinci's design.

676
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,254
You write the information
on a papyrus scroll...

677
01:00:29,459 --> 01:00:34,556
...which is then rolled around
a thin glass vial of vinegar.

678
01:00:34,764 --> 01:00:37,961
If you force it open, the vial breaks...

679
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,829
...vinegar dissolves papyrus...

680
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,165
...and your secret is lost forever.

681
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,600
The only way
to access the information...

682
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,176
...is to spell out the password...

683
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:53,838
...with these five dials,
each with 26 letters.

684
01:00:54,751 --> 01:00:58,448
That's 12 million possibilities.

685
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:02,717
I've never met a girl
who knew that much about a cryptex.

686
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,224
Sauniere made one for me once.

687
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,367
My grandfather gave me a wagon.

688
01:01:19,942 --> 01:01:22,206
This clearly is not the Holy Grail.

689
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:27,275
Come on.

690
01:01:27,550 --> 01:01:29,017
Please, you're not all right.

691
01:01:32,388 --> 01:01:34,151
May I try something?

692
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,424
I don't know why it works.

693
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:40,655
My mother used to do it
when I was scared, I think.

694
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:42,225
You think?

695
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,124
Yes.

696
01:01:56,145 --> 01:01:57,976
Feeling better, Sophie?

697
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:14,627
My parents died in a car crash
with my brother.

698
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:16,929
I was 4.

699
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:20,166
I'm sorry.

700
01:02:21,537 --> 01:02:23,471
It was many years ago.

701
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:40,384
Better?

702
01:02:43,159 --> 01:02:44,126
Yeah.

703
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,053
Okay.

704
01:03:12,188 --> 01:03:14,782
Twenty years waiting
for someone to come for that box...

705
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,516
...and now it's you two murderers.
Bring it to me.

706
01:03:18,327 --> 01:03:20,022
I don't know what
you're talking about.

707
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:23,164
All right! Okay!

708
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:24,855
Right now!

709
01:03:35,344 --> 01:03:36,311
Step back!

710
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,717
No one will lose sleep
over a couple on a killing spree.

711
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:47,412
Turn around.

712
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:50,023
Turn around!

713
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:52,054
You too, mademoiselle.

714
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:16,140
Sophie!

715
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:17,984
Get in the truck!

716
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:20,152
I'll drive! Hurry!

717
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:01,524
- Better?
- Always, if I got too nervous...

718
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,825
...I had to put my head out
of the window not to be sick.

719
01:05:05,501 --> 01:05:08,197
Sauniere used to say
I was like a dog.

720
01:05:09,472 --> 01:05:13,806
A cute dog. You know, a little dog.

721
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:26,411
What happened between you
and your grandfather, Sophie?

722
01:05:28,958 --> 01:05:32,826
I've jammed my shoulder,
I've been shot at, I'm bleeding.

723
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:34,587
I need to know.

724
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:38,255
You say he raised you,
but you two don't talk anymore.

725
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:40,435
You call him by his last name.

726
01:05:40,703 --> 01:05:43,263
You say you hate history.

727
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:45,736
Nobody hates history.
They hate their own histories.

728
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,933
So now you're a psychologist too?

729
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:52,509
What if Sauniere had started
to groom you for the Priory?

730
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:54,444
What do you mean, groom me?

731
01:05:54,650 --> 01:05:57,949
Your grandfather gave you puzzles
and cryptex as a child.

732
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:02,986
Say Sauniere was hoping one day
you would join him in the Priory.

733
01:06:03,192 --> 01:06:05,285
Still, years later,
when he imagines...

734
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:08,926
...the Grail is in danger,
he reaches out to you.

735
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:13,158
So you are saying all this is real?
The Priory, the Holy Grail?

736
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:16,497
We've been dragged into a world
of people who think this stuff is real.

737
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:18,799
- Real enough to kill for.
- Who?

738
01:06:25,047 --> 01:06:27,572
I'm out of my field here.

739
01:06:30,019 --> 01:06:34,683
I do know a Grail historian,
absolutely obsessed with Priory myth.

740
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:38,018
An Englishman,
lives here in France.

741
01:06:38,361 --> 01:06:39,953
Do you trust this man?

742
01:06:41,097 --> 01:06:42,621
I hope you can.

743
01:06:48,738 --> 01:06:50,535
Vernet, Andre.

744
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:55,039
It seems you're not a driver at all.

745
01:06:56,912 --> 01:07:01,679
Apparently, you lost your tongue
along with your truck.

746
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:09,084
Aiding and abetting
two murder suspects.

747
01:07:09,291 --> 01:07:11,725
That carries jail time.

748
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,024
Speak to my lawyer.

749
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:22,627
All this confusion, violence,
vanishing property...

750
01:07:22,838 --> 01:07:29,073
It might get around that your bank is
less than ideal, don't you think?

751
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:33,875
You think you're in pain now,
Andre Vernet?

752
01:07:34,316 --> 01:07:38,275
My cause is won'th your life.
Understand?

753
01:07:42,658 --> 01:07:44,216
What do you want?

754
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:49,793
Your truck carries a homing device.
Activate it.

755
01:07:57,740 --> 01:08:00,436
Please wait.
I'll see if he's available.

756
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:02,270
It's on the wrong side.

757
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:04,969
Leigh likes all things to be English,
including his cars.

758
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:08,309
Robert! Do I owe you money?

759
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:11,983
Leigh, my friend...

760
01:08:12,254 --> 01:08:15,519
...care to open up
for an old colleague?

761
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,453
- Of course.
- Thank you.

762
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,193
But first, a test of honor.

763
01:08:20,796 --> 01:08:22,491
Three questions.

764
01:08:25,801 --> 01:08:26,995
Fire away.

765
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:28,636
Your first:

766
01:08:28,838 --> 01:08:31,500
Shall I serve coffee or tea?

767
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:33,739
Tea, of course.

768
01:08:33,943 --> 01:08:35,001
Excellent.

769
01:08:35,211 --> 01:08:37,509
Second: Milk or lemon?

770
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:39,571
Milk?

771
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:43,282
That would depend on the tea.

772
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,453
Correct.

773
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:49,652
And now the third
and most grave of inquiries:

774
01:08:49,859 --> 01:08:55,161
In which year did a Harvard sculler
outrow an Oxford man at Henley?

775
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:06,436
Surely such a travesty
has never occurred.

776
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:08,941
Your heart is true.

777
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,177
You may pass.

778
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:15,347
Welcome to Chateau Villette.

779
01:09:19,922 --> 01:09:22,914
Leigh Teabing has spent
his entire life...

780
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:25,958
...studying the Grail.
That thing is one hot tamale.

781
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,561
Sorry?

782
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,823
The cryptex, it's a hot coal.

783
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,029
A hot potato?

784
01:09:35,738 --> 01:09:39,868
So you want to keep our chest
close to our cards, yes?

785
01:09:41,544 --> 01:09:43,409
Very close.

786
01:10:04,633 --> 01:10:07,227
The truck's signal is coming online.

787
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:08,868
It's about time.

788
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,233
Locked on and tracking, sir.

789
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:20,476
Very good. Tell Collet not to move in
until I get there.

790
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:25,544
Attention! All of Collet's units
to Chateau Villette.

791
01:10:26,488 --> 01:10:29,787
The suspects Neveu and Langdon
are likely at that location.

792
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:47,639
Aringarosa.

793
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,613
I still don't know why
he put you into this...

794
01:11:02,324 --> 01:11:04,224
...and I'm sorry.

795
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:10,525
But...

796
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,164
...l'm also very glad.

797
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,082
You are requested
to make yourself at home.

798
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:43,558
Robert!

799
01:11:44,667 --> 01:11:47,227
And you travel with a maiden,
it seems.

800
01:11:47,436 --> 01:11:50,667
Sir Leigh Teabing,
may I present Miss Sophie Neveu.

801
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,000
Sophie, Sir Leigh Teabing.

802
01:11:53,208 --> 01:11:57,008
It's an honor to welcome you...

803
01:11:57,646 --> 01:11:59,705
...even though it's late.

804
01:12:00,015 --> 01:12:03,849
Thank you for having us.
I realize it's quite late.

805
01:12:05,120 --> 01:12:08,112
So late, mademoiselle,
it's almost early.

806
01:12:10,759 --> 01:12:12,386
What a lovely smile you have.

807
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:15,463
Earl Grey?

808
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,490
Lemon.

809
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,359
Correct.

810
01:12:40,089 --> 01:12:42,284
Chateau Villette. Yes.

811
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,125
- No.
- Oh, you must.

812
01:12:50,332 --> 01:12:53,062
Remy is from Lyons,
but nevertheless...

813
01:12:53,268 --> 01:12:54,735
...he is fantastic with sauces.

814
01:12:54,937 --> 01:12:57,132
- Thank you.
- No, I can't.

815
01:13:01,977 --> 01:13:04,036
A dramatic late-night arrival.

816
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,814
Mention of life and death.

817
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:11,479
What can an old cripple
do for you, Robert?

818
01:13:12,454 --> 01:13:16,151
We wanna talk about
the Priory of Sion.

819
01:13:16,592 --> 01:13:17,820
The keepers?

820
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,092
The secret war?

821
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:22,286
Sorry for all the mystery.

822
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:26,023
Leigh, I'm into something here
that I cannot understand.

823
01:13:26,468 --> 01:13:27,560
You?

824
01:13:28,404 --> 01:13:31,771
- Really?
- Not without your help.

825
01:13:32,207 --> 01:13:35,267
Playing to my vanity, Robert.
You should be ashamed.

826
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:36,671
Not if it works.

827
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:41,442
There are always four:

828
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,379
The Grand Master
and the three senechaux...

829
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,988
...make up the primary
guardians of the Grail.

830
01:13:50,926 --> 01:13:52,689
Thank you, Remy.
That'll be all for now.

831
01:13:59,468 --> 01:14:02,801
The Priory's members
span our very globe itself.

832
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:07,442
Philippe de Cherisey
exposed that as a hoax in 1967.

833
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:09,577
And that is what
they want you to believe.

834
01:14:10,512 --> 01:14:13,310
The Priory is charged
with a single task:

835
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:16,848
To protect the greatest secret
in modern history.

836
01:14:17,052 --> 01:14:19,543
The source of God's power
on earth.

837
01:14:19,755 --> 01:14:21,347
No, that's a common
misunderstanding.

838
01:14:21,557 --> 01:14:26,494
The Priory protects the source
of the Church's power on earth:

839
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,493
The Holy Grail.

840
01:14:29,031 --> 01:14:30,658
I don't understand.

841
01:14:30,866 --> 01:14:34,996
What power? Some magic dishes?

842
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:39,833
Robert. Has he been telling you
that the Holy Grail is a cup?

843
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:44,241
To understand the Holy Grail,
my dear...

844
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:47,745
...you must first understand
the Holy Bible.

845
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:07,499
The Good Book did not arrive
by facsimile from heaven.

846
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:12,731
The Bible as we know it
was finally presided over by one man:

847
01:15:12,941 --> 01:15:14,670
The pagan emperor Constantine.

848
01:15:15,110 --> 01:15:17,237
I thought Constantine
was a Christian.

849
01:15:17,446 --> 01:15:20,381
Oh, hardly, no.
He was a lifelong pagan...

850
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:23,210
...who was baptized
on his deathbed.

851
01:15:23,418 --> 01:15:26,751
Constantine was Rome's
supreme holy man.

852
01:15:27,089 --> 01:15:28,579
From time immemorial...

853
01:15:28,790 --> 01:15:33,250
...his people had worshiped a balance
between nature's male deities...

854
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:36,954
...and the goddess,
or sacred feminine.

855
01:15:37,766 --> 01:15:41,293
But a growing religious turmoil
was gripping Rome.

856
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:43,835
Three centuries earlier...

857
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:47,008
...a young Jew named Jesus
had come along...

858
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,507
...preaching love and a single God.

859
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:52,839
Centuries after his crucifixion...

860
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:56,079
...Christ's followers
had grown exponentially...

861
01:15:56,285 --> 01:15:58,845
...and had started a religious war
against the pagans.

862
01:16:03,926 --> 01:16:07,327
Or did the pagans commence war
against the Christians?

863
01:16:07,996 --> 01:16:11,227
Leigh, we can't be sure who began
the atrocities in that period.

864
01:16:11,433 --> 01:16:14,368
We can at least agree that the
conflict grew to such proportions...

865
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:17,130
...that it threatened
to tear Rome in two.

866
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:20,604
So Constantine may have been
a lifelong pagan...

867
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,640
...but he was also a pragmatist.

868
01:16:22,844 --> 01:16:24,971
And in 325 anno Domini...

869
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:30,243
...he decided to unify Rome under
a single religion, Christianity.

870
01:16:30,452 --> 01:16:34,650
Christianity was on the rise.
He didn't want his empire torn apart.

871
01:16:34,856 --> 01:16:38,087
And to strengthen this new
Christian tradition...

872
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,557
...Constantine held
a famous ecumenical gathering...

873
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,595
...known as the Council of Nicaea.

874
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:45,266
And at this council...

875
01:16:45,467 --> 01:16:50,370
...the many sects of Christianity
debated and voted on, well...

876
01:16:50,572 --> 01:16:54,474
...everything, from the acceptance
and rejection of specific gospels...

877
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,200
...to the date for Easter...

878
01:16:56,411 --> 01:16:59,471
...to the administering
of the sacraments, and of course...

879
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,649
...the immortality of Jesus.

880
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:03,445
I don't follow.

881
01:17:03,885 --> 01:17:06,479
Well, ma chere,
until that moment in history...

882
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:11,685
...Jesus was viewed by many of his
followers as a mighty prophet...

883
01:17:11,893 --> 01:17:15,727
...as a great and powerful man,
but a man nevertheless.

884
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:18,763
A mortal man.

885
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:22,261
Some Christians held
that Jesus was mortal.

886
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,201
Some Christians believed
he was divine.

887
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,669
Not the Son of God?

888
01:17:26,875 --> 01:17:29,275
Not even his nephew twice removed.

889
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:33,346
Hold on, you're saying
Jesus' divinity came from a vote.

890
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:36,582
Well, remember, in those days,
gods were everywhere.

891
01:17:36,985 --> 01:17:41,149
By infusing Jesus the man
with the divine magic...

892
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:44,848
...by making him capable
of earthly miracles...

893
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:49,156
...as well as his own resurrection,
Constantine turned him into a god...

894
01:17:49,364 --> 01:17:51,559
...but within the human world.

895
01:17:51,767 --> 01:17:55,134
And he basically knocked the more
distant gods out of the game.

896
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,795
Constantine did not create
Jesus' divinity.

897
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:02,966
He simply sanctioned
an already widely held idea.

898
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:04,805
- Semantics.
- No, it's not semantics.

899
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:08,005
You're interpreting facts
to support your own conclusions.

900
01:18:08,216 --> 01:18:12,983
Fact: For many Christians, Jesus was
mortal one day and divine the next.

901
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,213
For some Christians,
his divinity was enanced.

902
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,892
Absurd. There was a formal
announcement of his promotion.

903
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,061
They couldn't even agree
on the Nicene Creed!

904
01:18:20,262 --> 01:18:23,663
Excuse me.
"Who is God, who is man?"

905
01:18:28,036 --> 01:18:30,903
How many have been murdered
over this question?

906
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:34,675
As long as there has been
a one true God...

907
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:37,037
...there has been killing
in his name.

908
01:18:45,620 --> 01:18:48,214
Now let me show you the Grail.

909
01:18:56,398 --> 01:18:59,458
This used to be the ballroom.

910
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,727
I have little occasion to dance
these days.

911
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:04,999
I trust you recognize
The Last Supper...

912
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:09,567
...the great fresco by
Leonardo da Vinci.

913
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:14,575
Now, my dear,
if you would close your eyes.

914
01:19:14,783 --> 01:19:17,013
Oh, Leigh, save us the parlor tricks.

915
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:19,551
You asked for my help, I recall.

916
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,383
Allow an old man his indulgences.

917
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:30,096
Now, mademoiselle,
where is Jesus sitting?

918
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:32,394
- In the middle.
- Good.

919
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:35,434
He and his disciples
are breaking bread.

920
01:19:35,637 --> 01:19:38,037
And what drink?

921
01:19:38,406 --> 01:19:40,271
Wine. They drank wine.

922
01:19:40,475 --> 01:19:42,773
Splendid. And one final question:

923
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:46,004
How many wineglasses
are there on the table?

924
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:49,316
One? The Holy Grail?

925
01:19:49,518 --> 01:19:50,485
Open your eyes.

926
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:55,082
No single cup.

927
01:19:55,657 --> 01:19:56,885
No chalice.

928
01:19:57,092 --> 01:19:59,822
Well, that's a bit strange, isn't it?

929
01:20:00,028 --> 01:20:03,156
Considering both the Bible
and standard Grail legend...

930
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:07,631
...celebrate this moment as the
definitive arrival of the Holy Grail.

931
01:20:10,405 --> 01:20:12,930
Now, Robert,
you could be of help to us.

932
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:17,043
If you'd be so kind as to show us the
symbols for man and woman, please.

933
01:20:17,245 --> 01:20:20,942
No balloon animals.
I can make a great duck.

934
01:20:23,985 --> 01:20:28,115
This is the original icon for male.
It's a rudimentary phallus.

935
01:20:28,323 --> 01:20:30,450
- Quite to the point.
- Yes, indeed.

936
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:32,718
This is known as the blade.

937
01:20:32,928 --> 01:20:34,793
It represents aggression
and manood.

938
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:37,760
It's a symbol still used today
in modern military uniforms.

939
01:20:37,966 --> 01:20:41,993
Yes, the more penises you have, the
higher your rank. Boys will be boys.

940
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:46,504
Now, as you would imagine, the
female symbol is its exact opposite.

941
01:20:46,708 --> 01:20:48,141
This is called the chalice.

942
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:53,144
And the chalice resembles a cup
or vessel or, more importantly...

943
01:20:53,348 --> 01:20:55,509
...the shape of a womars womb.

944
01:20:56,718 --> 01:20:59,687
No, the Grail has never been a cup.

945
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:04,848
It is quite literally this ancient
symbol of womanood.

946
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:11,125
And in this case, a woman who
carried a secret so powerful...

947
01:21:11,333 --> 01:21:15,633
...that if revealed, it would devastate
the very foundations of Christianity.

948
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:17,099
Wait, please.

949
01:21:17,305 --> 01:21:21,867
You're saying the Holy Grail
is a person? A woman?

950
01:21:22,677 --> 01:21:26,636
And it turns out, she makes
an appearance right there.

951
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:28,876
But they are all men.

952
01:21:29,084 --> 01:21:30,176
Are they?

953
01:21:30,418 --> 01:21:32,818
What about that figure
on the right hand of our Lord...

954
01:21:33,021 --> 01:21:35,717
...seated in the place of honor?

955
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,389
Flowing red hair.

956
01:21:39,527 --> 01:21:41,791
Folded feminine hands.

957
01:21:42,998 --> 01:21:45,398
Hint of a bosom. No?

958
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:54,273
It's called scotoma.
The mind sees what it chooses to see.

959
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:55,974
Who is she?

960
01:21:57,279 --> 01:21:59,144
My dear, that's Mary Magdalene.

961
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,571
The prostitute?

962
01:22:01,549 --> 01:22:03,016
She was no such thing.

963
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:08,014
Smeared by the Church
in 591 anno Domini, poor dear.

964
01:22:10,458 --> 01:22:13,256
Mary Magdalene was Jesus' wife.

965
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:22,270
This is an old wives' tale.

966
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,903
The original one, in fact.

967
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:26,198
There's virtually no empirical proof.

968
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:29,605
He knows as well as I do
there's much evidence to support it.

969
01:22:29,811 --> 01:22:31,472
Theories. There are theories.

970
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,808
Notice how Jesus and Mary
are clothed.

971
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:38,276
Mirror images of each other.

972
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,954
The mind sees
what it chooses to see.

973
01:22:41,156 --> 01:22:45,593
And venturing into the even more
bizarre, notice how Jesus and Mary...

974
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,286
...appear to be joined at the hip and
are leaning away from each other...

975
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:54,059
...as if to create a shape in the
negative space between them.

976
01:22:55,070 --> 01:22:58,403
Leonardo gives us the chalice.

977
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:03,502
Yes. Oh, and Robert,
notice what happens...

978
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:06,875
...when these two figures
change position.

979
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:11,014
Just because da Vinci painted it
doesn't make it true.

980
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,119
No. But history...

981
01:23:13,521 --> 01:23:15,318
...she does make it true.

982
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,754
Now, listen to this. It's from
the Gospel according to Philip.

983
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:19,927
Philip?

984
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:22,995
Yes, it was rejected
at the Council of Nicaea...

985
01:23:23,198 --> 01:23:25,189
...along with any other gospels
that made...

986
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,891
...Jesus appear human
and not divine.

987
01:23:28,103 --> 01:23:33,006
"And the companion of the Savior
is Mary Magdalene.

988
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:37,106
Christ loved her more
than all the disciples...

989
01:23:37,312 --> 01:23:39,177
...and used to kiss her on the..."

990
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,212
But this says nothing of marriage.

991
01:23:41,416 --> 01:23:44,180
Well, actually...

992
01:23:44,386 --> 01:23:45,353
Robert.

993
01:23:45,987 --> 01:23:50,617
Actually, in those days, the word
"companion" literally meant "spouse."

994
01:23:50,825 --> 01:23:55,262
And this is from the Gospel
of Mary Magdalene herself.

995
01:23:55,463 --> 01:23:58,125
- She wrote a gospel?
- She may have.

996
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:01,268
- Robert, will you fight fair?
- She may have.

997
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:05,428
"And Peter said,
'Did he prefer her to us? '

998
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:07,670
And Levi answered:

999
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:11,972
'Peter, I see you contending
against a woman like an adversary.

1000
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:16,640
If the Savior made her won'thy,
who are you, indeed, to reject her?"'

1001
01:24:16,851 --> 01:24:21,311
Yes. And then, my dear, Jesus
goes on to tell Mary Magdalene...

1002
01:24:21,523 --> 01:24:25,357
...that it's up to her
to continue his Church.

1003
01:24:26,461 --> 01:24:29,157
Mary Magdalene, not Peter.

1004
01:24:29,964 --> 01:24:33,764
The Church was supposed
to be carried on by a woman.

1005
01:24:34,235 --> 01:24:38,934
Few realize that Mary was descended
from kings, just as her husband was.

1006
01:24:39,541 --> 01:24:44,740
Now, my dear, the word
in French for Holy Grail.

1007
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:49,342
From the Middle English
"Sangreal"...

1008
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:52,111
...of the original Arthurian legend.

1009
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:57,451
Now, as two words.
Can you translate for our friend?

1010
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,618
Sang real, it means "royal blood."

1011
01:25:03,364 --> 01:25:07,562
When the legend speaks of the
chalice that held the blood of Christ...

1012
01:25:08,136 --> 01:25:13,438
...it speaks in fact of the female womb
that carried Jesus' royal bloodline.

1013
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:17,275
But how could Christ
have a bloodline, unless...?

1014
01:25:17,479 --> 01:25:20,312
Mary was pregnant
at the time of the Crucifixion.

1015
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:33,224
For her own safety and for that
of Christ's unborn child...

1016
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:36,488
...she fled the Holy Land
and came to France.

1017
01:25:36,698 --> 01:25:41,795
And here, it is said,
she gave birth to a daughter, Sarah.

1018
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:45,337
They know the child's name.

1019
01:25:46,307 --> 01:25:48,172
- A little girl.
- Yes.

1020
01:25:48,376 --> 01:25:50,469
If that were true,
it's adding insult to injury.

1021
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:51,736
Why?

1022
01:25:51,946 --> 01:25:55,575
The pagans found transcendence
through the joining of male to female.

1023
01:25:55,783 --> 01:25:57,478
People found God through sex?

1024
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:00,518
In paganism, women were worshiped
as a route to heaven...

1025
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:03,555
...but the modern Church
has a monopoly on that...

1026
01:26:03,758 --> 01:26:05,988
...in salvation through Jesus Christ.

1027
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:08,924
And he who keeps the keys to heaven
rules the world.

1028
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:12,293
Women, then, are a huge threat
to the Church.

1029
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,331
The Catholic Inquisition
soon publishes...

1030
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:17,835
...what may be the most
blood-soaked book in human history.

1031
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,500
The Malleus Maleficarum.

1032
01:26:21,604 --> 01:26:23,231
The Witches' Hammer.

1033
01:26:23,572 --> 01:26:27,303
It instructed the clergy on how
to locate, torture and kill...

1034
01:26:27,509 --> 01:26:29,739
...all freethinking women.

1035
01:26:32,915 --> 01:26:35,110
In three centuries of witch hunts...

1036
01:26:35,551 --> 01:26:39,248
...50,000 women are captured,
burned alive at the stake.

1037
01:26:39,455 --> 01:26:42,083
Oh, at least that.
Some say millions.

1038
01:26:42,691 --> 01:26:44,386
Imagine, then, Robert...

1039
01:26:44,893 --> 01:26:48,761
...that Christ's throne
might live on in a female child.

1040
01:26:49,765 --> 01:26:52,757
You asked what would
be won'th killing for.

1041
01:26:53,369 --> 01:26:56,930
Witness the greatest cover-up
in human history.

1042
01:26:57,740 --> 01:26:59,970
This is the secret
that the Priory of Sion...

1043
01:27:00,175 --> 01:27:02,575
...has defended
for over 20 centuries.

1044
01:27:02,778 --> 01:27:05,941
They are the guardians
of the royal bloodline.

1045
01:27:06,482 --> 01:27:09,940
The keepers of the proof
of our true past.

1046
01:27:10,152 --> 01:27:14,612
They are the protectors of the living
descendants of Jesus Christ...

1047
01:27:16,292 --> 01:27:18,021
...and Mary Magdalene.

1048
01:27:27,803 --> 01:27:29,031
Sir Leigh?

1049
01:27:29,838 --> 01:27:33,137
Sometimes I wonder
who is serving whom.

1050
01:27:33,842 --> 01:27:36,868
His sauces are not that fantastic.

1051
01:27:39,281 --> 01:27:40,748
Yes, can I help you?

1052
01:27:40,949 --> 01:27:42,974
Yes. They're on the news now.

1053
01:27:46,021 --> 01:27:49,320
Living descendants? Is it possible?

1054
01:27:49,525 --> 01:27:51,152
It's not impossible.

1055
01:27:52,428 --> 01:27:55,955
You have not been honest with me.
Your pictures are on the television.

1056
01:27:56,165 --> 01:27:58,065
You are wanted for four murders!

1057
01:27:58,500 --> 01:28:00,764
That's why Vernet said
"killing spree."

1058
01:28:00,969 --> 01:28:04,405
You come into my home,
playing on my passions for the Grail.

1059
01:28:04,606 --> 01:28:07,074
- That's why he needed you.
- You will leave my house!

1060
01:28:07,276 --> 01:28:09,267
- Leigh, listen!
- No, I'm calling the police.

1061
01:28:09,478 --> 01:28:11,810
Jacques Sauniere
was her grandfather.

1062
01:28:14,683 --> 01:28:16,310
You're the obsessive Priory scholar.

1063
01:28:16,518 --> 01:28:18,748
You still keep lists
of who might be in the Priory?

1064
01:28:19,955 --> 01:28:22,788
I'll bet Jacques Sauniere
was on one of those lists.

1065
01:28:24,727 --> 01:28:27,218
He was on your list of who could
be Grand Master, wasrt he?

1066
01:28:27,563 --> 01:28:30,123
- What?
- I'll bet he was right at the top.

1067
01:28:30,332 --> 01:28:35,497
Consider: Four men murdered?
The same number as the guardians.

1068
01:28:35,704 --> 01:28:38,969
What if the Priory was compromised,
the other senechaux dead?

1069
01:28:39,174 --> 01:28:41,267
What if you yourself were dying,
a Grand Master?

1070
01:28:41,910 --> 01:28:45,368
You'd have to pass the secret on
to someone you could trust.

1071
01:28:45,581 --> 01:28:47,276
Someone outside the society.

1072
01:28:47,483 --> 01:28:52,716
Maybe someone whose training
you had begun but never finished.

1073
01:28:55,057 --> 01:28:57,548
Robert, your ruse is pathetic.

1074
01:28:58,694 --> 01:29:00,059
Not really.

1075
01:29:01,630 --> 01:29:03,860
No, that's impossible.

1076
01:29:07,002 --> 01:29:08,629
Can that really...?

1077
01:29:11,039 --> 01:29:12,336
Is it the keystone?

1078
01:29:15,711 --> 01:29:18,043
I'll even show it to you, Leigh.

1079
01:29:18,414 --> 01:29:20,575
Will you just tell us
what the hell it's for?

1080
01:29:38,534 --> 01:29:40,195
Fache says to wait, so I wait.

1081
01:29:40,469 --> 01:29:44,530
What's Fache thinking?
The truck is here. They're inside.

1082
01:29:53,315 --> 01:29:54,441
Yes.

1083
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:57,448
As the legend foretold:

1084
01:29:59,254 --> 01:30:01,415
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1085
01:30:01,623 --> 01:30:03,215
Oh, my.

1086
01:30:10,132 --> 01:30:11,599
Leigh.

1087
01:30:15,003 --> 01:30:16,470
Leigh?

1088
01:30:17,439 --> 01:30:18,406
Please.

1089
01:30:18,607 --> 01:30:20,598
I'm sorry. Yes, of course.

1090
01:30:23,011 --> 01:30:25,036
Inside the keystone...

1091
01:30:26,415 --> 01:30:27,905
...there'll be a map.

1092
01:30:28,116 --> 01:30:30,914
A map that will lead us
to the Holy Grail.

1093
01:30:34,857 --> 01:30:37,792
To be trained by
the Grand Master himself.

1094
01:30:38,260 --> 01:30:42,094
Did he pass down the fleur-de-lis?
Is that how you found this?

1095
01:30:44,633 --> 01:30:47,500
And he must have sung you
the riddle songs.

1096
01:30:47,703 --> 01:30:49,227
I know some of them.

1097
01:30:58,514 --> 01:31:00,345
Can you keep secrets?

1098
01:31:01,950 --> 01:31:04,817
Can you know a thing
and never say it again?

1099
01:31:05,888 --> 01:31:06,946
And codes?

1100
01:31:08,223 --> 01:31:12,216
I imagine they lie down
for you like lovers.

1101
01:31:15,230 --> 01:31:20,133
A senechal. A guardian of the Grail
right here in my own home.

1102
01:31:20,335 --> 01:31:23,202
Tell him, please.
I don't know any of this.

1103
01:31:23,405 --> 01:31:26,272
Leigh, it's not that simple.
She doesn't rem...

1104
01:31:27,843 --> 01:31:29,071
Robert!

1105
01:31:34,416 --> 01:31:35,781
Do not move, woman.

1106
01:31:40,122 --> 01:31:41,089
Cripple.

1107
01:31:43,425 --> 01:31:45,450
Put the box on the table.

1108
01:31:46,161 --> 01:31:47,890
What, this trifle?

1109
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:52,055
Well, perhaps we can make
a financial arrangement.

1110
01:31:52,267 --> 01:31:55,293
Put the keystone on the table.

1111
01:31:56,271 --> 01:31:57,898
You will not succeed.

1112
01:32:00,208 --> 01:32:03,371
Only the won'thy
can unlock the stone.

1113
01:32:32,774 --> 01:32:35,140
Rip the gate down.

1114
01:32:38,647 --> 01:32:40,342
Well, well, my dear.

1115
01:32:44,519 --> 01:32:45,850
Sit down.

1116
01:32:46,054 --> 01:32:47,453
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

1117
01:32:47,656 --> 01:32:49,783
- Are you?
- Yeah.

1118
01:32:49,992 --> 01:32:52,324
Yes, well, make yourself useful,
you French fool.

1119
01:32:52,527 --> 01:32:54,688
Get something
to restrain this monster.

1120
01:32:59,701 --> 01:33:01,293
Above the joint.

1121
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:06,732
Fortunately,
a dragon most easy to slay.

1122
01:33:06,942 --> 01:33:08,341
He's wearing a cilice.

1123
01:33:09,144 --> 01:33:11,339
- A what?
- Well, look.

1124
01:33:13,849 --> 01:33:16,317
Inflicts pain so he can suffer
as Christ suffered.

1125
01:33:19,855 --> 01:33:22,585
Not so common these days.

1126
01:33:23,025 --> 01:33:24,925
Opus Dei.

1127
01:33:25,127 --> 01:33:27,595
Remy, take care of this.

1128
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,390
Fache is Opus Dei.

1129
01:33:34,670 --> 01:33:37,639
The policeman who's chasing us.
He wears the cross in the world.

1130
01:33:37,839 --> 01:33:39,466
Robert.

1131
01:33:41,810 --> 01:33:45,075
Well, I must say,
you two are anything but dull.

1132
01:33:46,415 --> 01:33:47,382
Leigh?

1133
01:33:49,551 --> 01:33:51,485
You want what's in this box?

1134
01:33:52,621 --> 01:33:54,350
We need a way out of here.

1135
01:33:54,556 --> 01:33:56,547
Well, actually...

1136
01:33:57,659 --> 01:33:59,354
...I do have a plane.

1137
01:34:09,905 --> 01:34:11,736
- Robert! Where do we go?
- Come along.

1138
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:13,771
- In here. Come in.
- Over here.

1139
01:34:13,975 --> 01:34:16,443
Get the door. Hurry.

1140
01:34:18,513 --> 01:34:20,413
Over here. Over here. Sophie.

1141
01:34:20,615 --> 01:34:21,877
Watch out!

1142
01:34:23,251 --> 01:34:24,843
Be careful.

1143
01:34:25,220 --> 01:34:26,915
Come, Rem...

1144
01:34:34,062 --> 01:34:35,393
Shit.

1145
01:34:38,433 --> 01:34:39,457
Easy.

1146
01:35:02,491 --> 01:35:03,458
Jesus!

1147
01:35:03,658 --> 01:35:04,625
Apropos.

1148
01:35:07,496 --> 01:35:09,361
I can't imagine
what your complaint is.

1149
01:35:09,564 --> 01:35:12,556
I'd be within my rights to shoot you
and let you rot in my woods!

1150
01:35:12,768 --> 01:35:15,134
Put that away. We might need him.

1151
01:35:15,771 --> 01:35:16,897
Better.

1152
01:35:23,879 --> 01:35:25,506
Opus Dei.

1153
01:35:26,481 --> 01:35:28,972
- What is it?
- A conservative Catholic sect.

1154
01:35:29,184 --> 01:35:31,049
Opus Dei is a prelature
to the Vatican.

1155
01:35:31,253 --> 01:35:34,586
You're saying the Vatican
is killing people for this box?

1156
01:35:34,790 --> 01:35:36,724
No, no, no. Not the Vatican...

1157
01:35:36,925 --> 01:35:39,416
...and not Opus Dei,
but we are in the middle of a war.

1158
01:35:39,628 --> 01:35:42,062
And one that has been
going on forever.

1159
01:35:42,264 --> 01:35:44,494
On the one side stands the Priory...

1160
01:35:44,699 --> 01:35:47,327
...and on the other
an ancient group of despots...

1161
01:35:47,536 --> 01:35:49,800
...with members hidden
in high-ranking positions...

1162
01:35:50,005 --> 01:35:51,768
...throughout the Church.

1163
01:35:51,973 --> 01:35:56,603
And this Council of Shadows tries
to destroy proof of the bloodline.

1164
01:35:56,812 --> 01:35:59,474
And that throughout history,
they seek out and kill...

1165
01:35:59,681 --> 01:36:01,615
...the living descendants
of Jesus Christ.

1166
01:36:01,817 --> 01:36:03,478
- That's insane.
- Is it?

1167
01:36:03,718 --> 01:36:06,278
How many atrocities and scandals
has the Catholic Church...

1168
01:36:06,488 --> 01:36:08,581
...rationalized in its time?
And what happens...

1169
01:36:08,790 --> 01:36:11,554
...if some persuasive scientific
evidence emerges that shows...

1170
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:14,820
...that the Church's version of Christ
is inaccurate?

1171
01:36:16,531 --> 01:36:17,828
What if the world discovers...

1172
01:36:18,033 --> 01:36:20,763
...that the greatest story ever told
is actually a lie?

1173
01:36:20,969 --> 01:36:24,632
The Vatican faces a crisis of faith
unprecedented.

1174
01:36:25,373 --> 01:36:28,001
I've got a signal now, sir.
It's ringing.

1175
01:36:30,178 --> 01:36:34,911
Roger, look, I'm so sorry. I've got
tired of the weather here in France...

1176
01:36:35,317 --> 01:36:38,252
...and could you make
the plane ready for...

1177
01:36:40,188 --> 01:36:41,348
...Zurich.

1178
01:36:41,923 --> 01:36:43,390
Yes. No, we love Zurich.

1179
01:36:51,366 --> 01:36:53,891
What the hell do you mean,
you lost them? Collet.

1180
01:36:56,037 --> 01:36:57,470
You're the one who lost them.

1181
01:36:57,873 --> 01:36:59,363
You control every step
of this investigation.

1182
01:36:59,574 --> 01:37:01,974
You don't let anybody breathe.

1183
01:37:02,510 --> 01:37:05,172
You're acting like
you lost your mind.

1184
01:37:08,583 --> 01:37:11,416
What is it with these two birds?

1185
01:37:15,056 --> 01:37:17,889
Interpol just registered a new
flight plan from Le Bourget.

1186
01:37:18,793 --> 01:37:22,024
Stay out of my way on this, Collet.

1187
01:37:50,025 --> 01:37:51,890
Did you kill Jacques Sauniere?

1188
01:37:55,297 --> 01:37:57,322
Did you kill Jacques Sauniere?

1189
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:00,097
I am the messenger of God.

1190
01:38:03,972 --> 01:38:06,133
Did you kill my grandfather?

1191
01:38:09,277 --> 01:38:10,938
I am the messenger...

1192
01:38:11,413 --> 01:38:15,440
Each breath you take is a sin.

1193
01:38:16,952 --> 01:38:19,352
No shadow will be safe again.

1194
01:38:19,554 --> 01:38:24,287
For you will be hunted by angels.

1195
01:38:25,727 --> 01:38:27,695
You believe in God?

1196
01:38:28,964 --> 01:38:31,455
Your God doesn't
forgive murderers.

1197
01:38:35,003 --> 01:38:36,834
He burns them.

1198
01:38:48,049 --> 01:38:49,038
Sophie.

1199
01:39:30,425 --> 01:39:31,983
The Teacher will be pleased.

1200
01:39:32,193 --> 01:39:34,388
What will you do
once you have the Grail?

1201
01:39:34,596 --> 01:39:35,858
Destroy it.

1202
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:39,693
The documents and the
sarcophagus, of course.

1203
01:39:41,036 --> 01:39:42,435
And the heir?

1204
01:39:46,241 --> 01:39:49,699
Will you exercise the final edict?
Spill his blood?

1205
01:39:50,311 --> 01:39:51,778
There will be no need.

1206
01:39:51,980 --> 01:39:56,679
Once the sarcophagus is destroyed,
DNA testing will be impossible.

1207
01:39:56,885 --> 01:39:59,615
There is no way to prove
a living bloodline.

1208
01:40:00,321 --> 01:40:01,948
But if you had to...

1209
01:40:03,591 --> 01:40:06,617
...would you do as councils
have done before us?

1210
01:40:15,603 --> 01:40:16,900
Christ...

1211
01:40:21,843 --> 01:40:26,109
Christ sacrificed his life
for the betterment of humanity.

1212
01:40:29,551 --> 01:40:32,452
So, too, may be the fate of his seed.

1213
01:40:42,097 --> 01:40:43,587
Robert.

1214
01:40:43,798 --> 01:40:47,757
When we land, you must go
straight to your embassy.

1215
01:40:49,104 --> 01:40:50,571
Is that so?

1216
01:40:52,507 --> 01:40:54,600
Don't you see it?

1217
01:40:54,809 --> 01:40:56,538
They never wanted you.

1218
01:40:57,378 --> 01:41:00,074
Maybe even Fache didn't.

1219
01:41:00,281 --> 01:41:03,341
It's all about this...

1220
01:41:03,551 --> 01:41:05,212
...idiotic little box.

1221
01:41:10,024 --> 01:41:11,992
That's not too flattering.

1222
01:41:12,660 --> 01:41:14,992
Crazy old man.

1223
01:41:15,363 --> 01:41:17,593
Why leave me with this?

1224
01:41:17,999 --> 01:41:20,593
I should just throw it away.

1225
01:41:24,906 --> 01:41:26,669
He trusted you, Sophie.

1226
01:41:27,709 --> 01:41:31,042
A guardian of the Holy Grail.

1227
01:41:32,647 --> 01:41:35,013
It sounds so stupid.

1228
01:41:36,251 --> 01:41:40,620
It's quite an honor,
if you think about it...

1229
01:41:40,822 --> 01:41:42,119
...and take it seriously.

1230
01:41:42,557 --> 01:41:45,287
He took it seriously enough
to get himself killed.

1231
01:41:45,994 --> 01:41:48,087
Not him. You.

1232
01:41:50,999 --> 01:41:53,661
He was the only family I knew.

1233
01:41:54,169 --> 01:41:56,467
And maybe I didn't know him at all.

1234
01:41:58,072 --> 01:42:00,063
I'm his marionette, Robert.

1235
01:42:00,275 --> 01:42:03,369
Like a girl again,
just with no gift at the end.

1236
01:42:09,117 --> 01:42:11,017
But you've done enough.

1237
01:42:13,721 --> 01:42:18,385
I don't know why Sauniere
picked me to help you, Sophie.

1238
01:42:20,695 --> 01:42:24,062
But I won't leave you alone
in all this.

1239
01:42:30,371 --> 01:42:31,998
Two marionettes, then.

1240
01:42:35,843 --> 01:42:38,004
Maybe this is why he chose you.

1241
01:42:41,149 --> 01:42:43,481
Because you will stay.

1242
01:42:58,967 --> 01:43:00,730
I need the flight plan.

1243
01:43:01,069 --> 01:43:02,058
Ten minutes.

1244
01:43:03,071 --> 01:43:05,403
I asked you to get it for me.

1245
01:43:06,574 --> 01:43:08,474
I'm on break.

1246
01:43:09,944 --> 01:43:11,502
Come back in 10 minutes.

1247
01:43:13,548 --> 01:43:15,675
My nose! My nose!

1248
01:43:16,284 --> 01:43:17,683
The flight plan, please.

1249
01:43:17,885 --> 01:43:18,852
You asshole!

1250
01:43:32,133 --> 01:43:33,862
It's not "cross."

1251
01:43:35,103 --> 01:43:36,400
"Spear"?

1252
01:43:43,411 --> 01:43:44,935
What happened to her?

1253
01:43:45,713 --> 01:43:47,305
No one knows.

1254
01:43:47,749 --> 01:43:51,082
Mary Magdalene lived out
her days in hiding.

1255
01:43:52,754 --> 01:43:55,154
And the zealots pursued her still...

1256
01:43:55,757 --> 01:44:00,126
...even in death, trying to destroy
proof of her existence.

1257
01:44:01,129 --> 01:44:03,461
But she always had her Knights.

1258
01:44:03,665 --> 01:44:06,099
Brave men sworn to defend her.

1259
01:44:06,301 --> 01:44:08,861
You see, to worship
before her sarcophagus...

1260
01:44:09,370 --> 01:44:12,635
...to kneel before the bones
of Mary Magdalene...

1261
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:16,003
...was to remember all those
who were robbed of their power...

1262
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:17,199
...who were oppressed.

1263
01:44:17,612 --> 01:44:22,049
Ultimately, the Priory hid her remains
and the proof of her bloodline...

1264
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:24,878
...until most believed
her sarcophagus...

1265
01:44:25,887 --> 01:44:27,548
...the Holy Grail...

1266
01:44:28,556 --> 01:44:31,525
...was finally lost in time.

1267
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:43,459
What are you doing?

1268
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:46,299
At the chateau, you said,
"It hides beneath the Rose."

1269
01:44:46,507 --> 01:44:47,872
No, no, no. Do be careful.

1270
01:44:48,076 --> 01:44:51,671
In Latin, sub rosa.
Literal translation...

1271
01:44:51,879 --> 01:44:53,471
"Beneath the rose."

1272
01:45:06,494 --> 01:45:07,961
We need a mirror.

1273
01:45:08,162 --> 01:45:10,995
Backwards. In the style
of Leonardo himself.

1274
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:12,860
Thank you.

1275
01:45:17,205 --> 01:45:21,164
In London lies a knight
a Pope interred

1276
01:45:21,376 --> 01:45:25,073
His labor's fruit
a Holy wrath incurred

1277
01:45:25,480 --> 01:45:28,415
You seek the orb
that ought be on his tomb

1278
01:45:28,816 --> 01:45:32,445
It speaks of Rosy flesh
and seeded womb

1279
01:45:32,653 --> 01:45:36,589
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred"?

1280
01:45:36,791 --> 01:45:40,591
A knight whose funeral
was presided over by the Pope.

1281
01:45:40,795 --> 01:45:43,992
Of course, the Priory knights
were not just any knights.

1282
01:45:44,198 --> 01:45:45,165
Templars.

1283
01:45:45,366 --> 01:45:48,460
And there's just one place to bury
a Templar knight in London.

1284
01:45:48,669 --> 01:45:49,761
Temple Church.

1285
01:45:49,971 --> 01:45:52,132
Temple Church.
If you'll excuse me, my dear...

1286
01:45:52,340 --> 01:45:55,173
...Roger and I must discuss
a change in flight plan.

1287
01:45:55,376 --> 01:45:56,741
Leigh.

1288
01:45:58,479 --> 01:46:00,879
Harboring and transporting
fugitives?

1289
01:46:01,649 --> 01:46:04,209
You are already implicated enough.

1290
01:46:05,420 --> 01:46:09,015
You and I, Robert,
have observed history.

1291
01:46:09,223 --> 01:46:11,453
Time has been our glass.

1292
01:46:12,026 --> 01:46:15,223
We are in history now. Living it.

1293
01:46:16,931 --> 01:46:18,558
Making it.

1294
01:46:19,267 --> 01:46:20,700
"Lmplicated"?

1295
01:46:20,935 --> 01:46:23,460
I am on a Grail quest.

1296
01:46:25,106 --> 01:46:26,596
Forgive me, Robert...

1297
01:46:26,808 --> 01:46:29,106
...but you two may well
have given this old man...

1298
01:46:29,310 --> 01:46:31,642
...the greatest night of his life.

1299
01:46:33,514 --> 01:46:34,640
Thank you.

1300
01:46:36,751 --> 01:46:38,878
He's going to want more money.

1301
01:46:56,003 --> 01:47:00,099
I suppose this is a new technique
for investigations.

1302
01:47:00,308 --> 01:47:05,405
I've lost them.
They flew to Switzerland.

1303
01:47:05,680 --> 01:47:07,875
No extradition.

1304
01:47:10,651 --> 01:47:16,920
The controller filed charges.
Ari was on dispatch. He called me.

1305
01:47:21,028 --> 01:47:24,088
What's going on, Bezu?

1306
01:47:27,134 --> 01:47:29,967
You know that I am Opus Dei?

1307
01:47:30,371 --> 01:47:31,895
Yes.

1308
01:47:37,211 --> 01:47:40,703
A bishop of my order called me.

1309
01:47:41,048 --> 01:47:43,141
He said a killer
came to him in confession.

1310
01:47:43,351 --> 01:47:46,081
His name was Robert Langdon.

1311
01:47:47,288 --> 01:47:50,382
He said I couldn't imagine
the evil in this mars heart.

1312
01:47:50,591 --> 01:47:53,287
That he would keep killing.

1313
01:47:53,694 --> 01:47:56,128
He said I had to stop him.

1314
01:47:58,199 --> 01:48:01,999
The bishop broke his vows
to tell me this.

1315
01:48:02,203 --> 01:48:05,604
He charged me
to stop Robert Langdon.

1316
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:13,309
Tell me, Collet, who have I failed?

1317
01:48:14,148 --> 01:48:15,911
The bishop?

1318
01:48:17,251 --> 01:48:19,310
God himself?

1319
01:48:27,995 --> 01:48:31,055
They've changed their flight plan
to London.

1320
01:48:37,004 --> 01:48:41,441
Go on, Fache.
I'll take care of the controller.

1321
01:48:41,642 --> 01:48:46,739
Maybe he needs a few extra euros.

1322
01:48:47,648 --> 01:48:51,379
Just tell me next time.

1323
01:49:15,543 --> 01:49:19,274
I have them, tower. Relay Hawker
to land and hold on tarmac.

1324
01:50:16,570 --> 01:50:18,765
- Secure the area!
- Wider!

1325
01:50:18,973 --> 01:50:21,066
- Armed police!
- You two, round the back!

1326
01:50:21,442 --> 01:50:24,639
Armed police!
Put your hands in the air!

1327
01:50:24,845 --> 01:50:26,779
- Three men up!
- Ready!

1328
01:50:26,981 --> 01:50:29,575
Put your hands in the air! Do it now!

1329
01:50:29,784 --> 01:50:32,184
I'm afraid that's
easier said than done in my case.

1330
01:50:34,255 --> 01:50:35,552
Oh, good morning.

1331
01:50:35,756 --> 01:50:38,623
Did that old cannabis charge
finally catch up with me?

1332
01:50:38,826 --> 01:50:41,522
Sir, the French police say
you're transporting fugitives...

1333
01:50:41,729 --> 01:50:43,492
...and you may have
a hostage onboard.

1334
01:50:43,698 --> 01:50:45,222
I'm to take you all into custody.

1335
01:50:45,433 --> 01:50:48,766
Sadly, I have an important medical
appointment which I can't miss.

1336
01:50:48,969 --> 01:50:50,197
I'll fetch the car, sir.

1337
01:50:50,404 --> 01:50:53,237
This is serious, sir. The French police
are on their way. Stop!

1338
01:50:53,841 --> 01:50:57,106
Inspector, I can't afford the time
to indulge your games.

1339
01:50:57,311 --> 01:50:58,642
I'm late and I'm leaving.

1340
01:50:58,846 --> 01:51:00,677
If it's so important
for you to stop us...

1341
01:51:00,881 --> 01:51:03,111
...then you're just going
to have to shoot us.

1342
01:51:03,651 --> 01:51:05,278
You can start with him.

1343
01:51:10,691 --> 01:51:12,249
Search the plane.

1344
01:51:12,460 --> 01:51:13,688
All right.

1345
01:51:25,906 --> 01:51:27,567
I could run them over.

1346
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,172
Bad tip.

1347
01:51:36,217 --> 01:51:37,582
Let him go.

1348
01:51:42,089 --> 01:51:44,455
The French cannot be trusted.

1349
01:51:53,167 --> 01:51:54,134
Everyone comfy?

1350
01:51:56,604 --> 01:51:57,571
Biscuits?

1351
01:51:58,139 --> 01:51:59,800
They didn't notice anything?

1352
01:52:00,207 --> 01:52:04,667
Well, people rarely notice things right
in front of their eyes, don't you find?

1353
01:52:18,759 --> 01:52:21,284
Do you have the bonds, bishop?

1354
01:52:21,529 --> 01:52:22,757
Yes, I do, Teacher.

1355
01:52:22,963 --> 01:52:26,262
I have chosen an Opus Dei
residence for the exchange.

1356
01:52:26,467 --> 01:52:27,900
I am honored.

1357
01:52:28,169 --> 01:52:32,970
By the time you get to London,
I will have the Grail.

1358
01:52:35,576 --> 01:52:38,545
- I take it the news is good, then.
- I fly to London.

1359
01:52:38,746 --> 01:52:40,737
The Teacher is waiting for me there.

1360
01:52:40,948 --> 01:52:44,543
He has chosen a house of Opus Dei
to make the exchange.

1361
01:52:44,752 --> 01:52:49,121
Mere currency
for the location of the Grail.

1362
01:52:49,323 --> 01:52:51,291
Imagine it.

1363
01:52:57,198 --> 01:53:02,192
Remember, if we are discovered by
the Vatican, we are excommunicated.

1364
01:53:02,403 --> 01:53:05,395
- So should anything go wrong...
- Yes, I know, I know.

1365
01:53:06,540 --> 01:53:08,201
This council does not exist.

1366
01:53:09,210 --> 01:53:10,939
As it never has.

1367
01:53:13,814 --> 01:53:17,545
Old friend. Heaven protect you.

1368
01:53:25,059 --> 01:53:27,027
Keep an eye out for the police.

1369
01:53:40,174 --> 01:53:42,802
I must say, Robert,
I'm quite impressed...

1370
01:53:43,010 --> 01:53:46,275
...by the way you withstood
my little aeroplane.

1371
01:53:47,915 --> 01:53:49,439
Did he never tell you?

1372
01:53:49,650 --> 01:53:52,949
When he was a boy,
young Robert fell into a well.

1373
01:53:53,153 --> 01:53:54,780
How old were you?

1374
01:53:54,989 --> 01:53:56,115
Seven.

1375
01:53:58,826 --> 01:54:01,886
Treading water all night long,
screaming his lungs out...

1376
01:54:02,096 --> 01:54:04,087
...to the echoes screaming back.

1377
01:54:04,298 --> 01:54:06,823
When they found him,
he was nearly catatonic.

1378
01:54:07,034 --> 01:54:08,092
Help!

1379
01:54:09,169 --> 01:54:10,500
It was a long time ago.

1380
01:54:10,704 --> 01:54:12,296
Oh, now, now, Robert.

1381
01:54:12,506 --> 01:54:17,000
You above all people shouldn't be one
to dismiss the influence of the past.

1382
01:54:22,216 --> 01:54:25,515
Temple Church.
I always forget it's right here.

1383
01:54:25,719 --> 01:54:31,385
Built 1185 and modern London
just sprang up right around it.

1384
01:54:34,495 --> 01:54:38,761
Tell me, why has the Priory kept the
Grail location secret all these years?

1385
01:54:38,966 --> 01:54:39,933
I don't know.

1386
01:54:40,334 --> 01:54:42,962
Some say the Priory wait
for the heir to reveal himself...

1387
01:54:43,170 --> 01:54:44,933
...which is especially odd...

1388
01:54:45,139 --> 01:54:48,472
...since legend suggests he may not
know his own true identity.

1389
01:54:56,483 --> 01:54:57,450
Hello?

1390
01:54:58,252 --> 01:55:00,880
Why do they make them so scary?

1391
01:55:06,527 --> 01:55:07,619
Oh, it's cold.

1392
01:55:07,828 --> 01:55:11,127
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1393
01:55:21,008 --> 01:55:24,409
So which tomb has an orb?

1394
01:55:40,761 --> 01:55:43,958
Those knights
with their legs crossed...

1395
01:55:44,164 --> 01:55:46,223
...means they'd been
to the Holy Land.

1396
01:55:46,433 --> 01:55:49,664
Two wear tunics over their armor...

1397
01:55:49,870 --> 01:55:52,998
...and two have full-length robes.

1398
01:55:54,074 --> 01:55:55,803
Two are grasping swords.

1399
01:55:56,276 --> 01:55:59,871
And one... Two are praying.

1400
01:56:01,849 --> 01:56:03,817
This one has his arms at his sides.

1401
01:56:04,018 --> 01:56:07,681
Oh, and this poor fellow
has almost disappeared entirely.

1402
01:56:07,888 --> 01:56:12,587
I don't see any orb
that ought be on a tomb.

1403
01:56:13,494 --> 01:56:16,224
"Ought be on his tomb."
Are we looking for a missing orb?

1404
01:56:16,430 --> 01:56:18,295
Maybe.

1405
01:56:29,109 --> 01:56:30,667
These aren't tombs.

1406
01:56:30,878 --> 01:56:33,244
- What? Yes, of course they are.
- No.

1407
01:56:33,447 --> 01:56:35,438
- They're effigies.
- What?

1408
01:56:35,649 --> 01:56:37,549
Not tombs. There's no bodies here.

1409
01:56:37,918 --> 01:56:39,351
This place is wrong.

1410
01:56:41,388 --> 01:56:44,721
Can we go now? We should go.

1411
01:56:47,928 --> 01:56:49,589
Sophie! No!

1412
01:56:51,365 --> 01:56:52,798
Where is the keystone?

1413
01:56:53,934 --> 01:56:55,060
Do not test me!

1414
01:56:55,269 --> 01:56:56,531
- Let her go!
- Don't hurt her.

1415
01:56:56,737 --> 01:56:58,796
Give me the keystone! Give it to me!

1416
01:56:59,006 --> 01:57:00,701
Here! Here! Here it is! Here it is.

1417
01:57:00,908 --> 01:57:04,537
Just let her go, and you and I can...
We'll come to some agreement.

1418
01:57:05,145 --> 01:57:06,578
Remy.

1419
01:57:09,950 --> 01:57:12,475
Remy. No, no, no. No, put it away.

1420
01:57:13,787 --> 01:57:17,018
Put it away. They're too close
together. You don't have a clear shot.

1421
01:57:17,224 --> 01:57:19,590
- Yes, I do.
- What do you think you're doing?

1422
01:57:21,862 --> 01:57:26,265
Thank you, professor. For a moment,
this was getting complicated.

1423
01:57:26,467 --> 01:57:28,526
Oh, this is absurd.
Oh, for God's sake, man!

1424
01:57:31,872 --> 01:57:33,965
That was satisfying.

1425
01:57:34,174 --> 01:57:36,039
I'm glad this bullshit is over.

1426
01:57:39,279 --> 01:57:41,008
Throw Teabing in the trunk.

1427
01:57:41,215 --> 01:57:42,443
What?

1428
01:57:47,888 --> 01:57:49,856
Here. You okay?

1429
01:57:55,395 --> 01:57:56,362
Sorry.

1430
01:58:37,337 --> 01:58:39,134
I don't think he's following.

1431
01:58:47,347 --> 01:58:51,249
They won't kill Leigh
until they find the Grail.

1432
01:58:53,353 --> 01:58:56,584
- So we have to find it before they do.
- I have to get to a library, fast.

1433
01:59:04,531 --> 01:59:06,158
Lieutenant!

1434
01:59:06,366 --> 01:59:07,958
One flag off the prints.

1435
01:59:11,672 --> 01:59:13,663
Remy Legaludec.

1436
01:59:13,874 --> 01:59:15,466
Petty theft.

1437
01:59:17,277 --> 01:59:21,043
Skipped out on a hospital bill
for a tracheotomy.

1438
01:59:22,950 --> 01:59:24,781
Peanut allergy.

1439
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:27,585
Like Marie.

1440
01:59:27,788 --> 01:59:29,221
This way. Marie?

1441
01:59:29,423 --> 01:59:32,085
My daughter.

1442
01:59:32,292 --> 01:59:33,884
Over here.

1443
01:59:40,767 --> 01:59:41,756
Where?

1444
01:59:41,969 --> 01:59:43,231
Up there.

1445
02:00:00,654 --> 02:00:02,315
What's all that?

1446
02:00:02,522 --> 02:00:04,854
Very advanced surveillance.

1447
02:00:09,596 --> 02:00:10,893
It's a listening post.

1448
02:00:20,374 --> 02:00:22,535
Get me Fache.

1449
02:00:22,743 --> 02:00:27,646
Four of these names are
the men killed last night.

1450
02:00:35,789 --> 02:00:40,726
He once whined to me about the
wasted space of so large a trunk.

1451
02:00:41,194 --> 02:00:43,321
Let's see if he complains so now.

1452
02:00:44,398 --> 02:00:46,332
Are you the Teacher?

1453
02:00:49,569 --> 02:00:50,593
I am.

1454
02:00:52,406 --> 02:00:56,900
Superbly done.
You've been of great service.

1455
02:01:00,414 --> 02:01:03,178
The cryptex has yet to be opened.
I can still serve.

1456
02:01:03,383 --> 02:01:05,510
You've done enough.

1457
02:01:08,755 --> 02:01:12,418
We cannot let ego
deter us from our goal.

1458
02:01:13,593 --> 02:01:15,527
I understand.

1459
02:01:16,596 --> 02:01:17,722
Good.

1460
02:01:20,934 --> 02:01:25,701
Wait here, at this house of Opus Dei,
and you will be rewarded.

1461
02:01:25,906 --> 02:01:28,101
I will dispose of the old man.

1462
02:01:29,276 --> 02:01:30,903
Bless you, Silas.

1463
02:01:32,946 --> 02:01:34,174
Teacher.

1464
02:01:42,389 --> 02:01:44,118
Christ be with you.

1465
02:01:46,860 --> 02:01:51,991
We're at least a half-hour
to Chelsea Library.

1466
02:01:52,299 --> 02:01:54,324
If we're gonna help Leigh,
that's too long.

1467
02:02:06,046 --> 02:02:07,445
Where you going?

1468
02:02:07,647 --> 02:02:09,774
Getting you a library card.

1469
02:02:13,387 --> 02:02:15,412
Excuse me. May I sit next to you?

1470
02:02:15,622 --> 02:02:18,113
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1471
02:02:26,666 --> 02:02:27,963
That's great.

1472
02:02:28,902 --> 02:02:31,097
Didrt say you had a boyfriend.

1473
02:02:33,807 --> 02:02:35,104
Thanks.

1474
02:02:35,742 --> 02:02:39,041
Let's see if we can access
the database on this.

1475
02:02:39,246 --> 02:02:42,647
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1476
02:02:42,849 --> 02:02:44,612
Compounding keywords:

1477
02:02:44,818 --> 02:02:47,685
Knight, Pope, Grail.

1478
02:02:48,321 --> 02:02:52,314
Your precious treasure was
almost lost, and with it, my fortune.

1479
02:02:56,730 --> 02:02:58,994
Can you believe how well I did?

1480
02:03:00,567 --> 02:03:02,694
I even convinced the monk.

1481
02:03:03,570 --> 02:03:05,504
I should be in theater.

1482
02:03:12,212 --> 02:03:17,707
A toast to our success, Teacher.
The end of the journey is near.

1483
02:03:20,253 --> 02:03:23,552
Your identity shall go
with me to the grave.

1484
02:03:28,995 --> 02:03:32,624
There's your problem, mate.
It's your basic linguistic coincidence.

1485
02:03:33,066 --> 02:03:35,193
See, keywords keep coming up
with the writings...

1486
02:03:35,402 --> 02:03:38,337
...of some bloke named
Alexander Pope.

1487
02:03:38,538 --> 02:03:39,766
"A. Pope."

1488
02:03:41,408 --> 02:03:43,171
Your grandfather was a genius.

1489
02:03:48,081 --> 02:03:49,105
Come on.

1490
02:04:23,783 --> 02:04:25,478
Emergency.
Which service do you require?

1491
02:04:25,685 --> 02:04:30,782
I know the location of two murderers
wanted by French police.

1492
02:04:34,694 --> 02:04:36,787
We've just had a 999 call.

1493
02:04:36,997 --> 02:04:39,329
Triangulation leads back
to Docklands.

1494
02:04:39,533 --> 02:04:41,592
Caller was male.
Claimed your two murderers...

1495
02:04:41,801 --> 02:04:44,395
...are hiding at an Opus Dei house.

1496
02:04:53,547 --> 02:04:57,643
The knight we're looking for
is Sir Isaac Newton.

1497
02:04:59,185 --> 02:05:02,882
His life's work produced new sciences
that incurred the wrath of the Church.

1498
02:05:03,390 --> 02:05:05,654
Gravity, for God sakes.

1499
02:05:07,027 --> 02:05:10,087
And if you choose to believe...

1500
02:05:10,297 --> 02:05:14,700
...he was also a Grand Master
of the Priory as well.

1501
02:05:25,278 --> 02:05:27,872
But if he offended
the Catholic Church...

1502
02:05:28,081 --> 02:05:31,847
...the Pope would be the last person
to preside over his funeral.

1503
02:05:32,052 --> 02:05:34,247
Well, that's where I got it wrong.

1504
02:05:34,454 --> 02:05:37,355
"In London lies a knight
a Pope interred."

1505
02:05:37,557 --> 02:05:40,617
Sir Isaac Newtors funeral
was presided over...

1506
02:05:40,827 --> 02:05:44,456
...by his good friend,
his colleague, Alexander Pope.

1507
02:05:44,664 --> 02:05:49,101
A. Pope. His first initial.
How did I miss that?

1508
02:05:49,569 --> 02:05:50,627
Here.

1509
02:05:51,004 --> 02:05:54,132
Yes. Isaac Newtors tomb.

1510
02:05:55,275 --> 02:05:56,469
An orb.

1511
02:05:56,676 --> 02:06:01,636
Yes. Which one? It's not possible
to tell if a particular orb is missing.

1512
02:06:01,848 --> 02:06:05,340
"An orb with Rosy flesh
and seeded womb."

1513
02:06:05,552 --> 02:06:10,114
Solar system. The planets.
Constellations. Signs of the zodiac.

1514
02:06:10,724 --> 02:06:12,817
See, our moon is missing.

1515
02:06:13,026 --> 02:06:15,859
The moons of Saturn and Jupiter.
They're not here.

1516
02:06:16,229 --> 02:06:18,754
Eyes of the cherubs themselves?

1517
02:06:20,767 --> 02:06:23,668
Robert. These tracks.

1518
02:06:24,537 --> 02:06:26,835
Look at the cane marks in the dust.

1519
02:06:29,943 --> 02:06:31,342
Teabing was here.

1520
02:06:32,746 --> 02:06:33,906
He was alone.

1521
02:06:35,915 --> 02:06:40,011
When the two of you
arrived at my home as you did...

1522
02:06:41,154 --> 02:06:43,952
...others might call it God's will.

1523
02:06:44,858 --> 02:06:47,349
I believed that if I had the cryptex...

1524
02:06:47,727 --> 02:06:50,753
...I could solve the riddle alone.

1525
02:06:51,665 --> 02:06:53,132
But I was unwon'thy.

1526
02:06:53,333 --> 02:06:54,595
But you...

1527
02:06:55,435 --> 02:06:57,869
You have a reason to be here.

1528
02:06:58,071 --> 02:07:01,700
You're the last remaining
guardian of the Grail.

1529
02:07:01,941 --> 02:07:04,034
Your grandfather
and the other senechaux...

1530
02:07:04,244 --> 02:07:06,212
...would not have lied
with dying breath...

1531
02:07:06,413 --> 02:07:09,246
...unless they knew
their secret was preserved.

1532
02:07:11,685 --> 02:07:14,415
How could you know
Sauniere's last words?

1533
02:07:14,621 --> 02:07:15,588
Leigh.

1534
02:07:16,790 --> 02:07:19,054
Grail quests require sacrifice.

1535
02:07:19,592 --> 02:07:20,923
You are a murderer.

1536
02:07:21,127 --> 02:07:24,153
No. No. Robert, tell her.

1537
02:07:24,364 --> 02:07:28,164
When history is written,
murderers are heroes.

1538
02:07:30,270 --> 02:07:32,295
You self-righteous bastard!

1539
02:07:32,505 --> 02:07:33,802
We need to just walk away.

1540
02:07:34,007 --> 02:07:35,804
- No, don't. Don't.
- Walk away.

1541
02:07:39,112 --> 02:07:40,670
I'll do what I have to now.

1542
02:07:46,019 --> 02:07:47,145
Anything.

1543
02:07:51,291 --> 02:07:52,724
Do you understand?

1544
02:07:54,427 --> 02:07:56,088
So now...

1545
02:07:57,297 --> 02:07:59,322
...can't we all be friends again?

1546
02:08:00,633 --> 02:08:01,930
This way.

1547
02:08:38,204 --> 02:08:42,004
I'm going to put this gun down.
I only want you both to listen.

1548
02:08:43,877 --> 02:08:45,071
I'm listening now.

1549
02:08:45,678 --> 02:08:47,077
For 2000 years...

1550
02:08:47,714 --> 02:08:51,616
...the Church has rained oppression
and atrocity upon mankind...

1551
02:08:52,418 --> 02:08:57,355
...crushed passion and idea alike,
all in the name of their walking God.

1552
02:08:57,624 --> 02:09:02,027
Proof of Jesus' mortality can bring
an end to all that suffering...

1553
02:09:02,529 --> 02:09:05,430
...drive this church of lies
to its knees.

1554
02:09:07,100 --> 02:09:08,658
Armed police!

1555
02:09:08,935 --> 02:09:10,232
Drop your weapon!

1556
02:09:13,840 --> 02:09:14,807
Stop, Silas!

1557
02:09:27,654 --> 02:09:30,782
We are betrayed, my son.

1558
02:09:31,391 --> 02:09:33,985
The living heir must be revealed.

1559
02:09:34,494 --> 02:09:36,724
Jesus must be shown
for what he was.

1560
02:09:36,930 --> 02:09:40,127
Not miraculous, simply man.

1561
02:09:41,234 --> 02:09:42,701
I'm sorry.

1562
02:09:44,871 --> 02:09:46,463
Armed police!

1563
02:09:46,840 --> 02:09:49,934
Drop your weapon! Drop it! Drop it!

1564
02:09:59,385 --> 02:10:01,876
Put it down now! Put it down!

1565
02:10:09,596 --> 02:10:11,621
I am a ghost.

1566
02:10:12,799 --> 02:10:15,393
The dark con can be exposed.

1567
02:10:15,635 --> 02:10:20,937
Mankind can finally be set free,
and we can do it, Robert.

1568
02:10:22,208 --> 02:10:23,732
The three of us.

1569
02:10:41,661 --> 02:10:43,060
How is Silas?

1570
02:10:43,263 --> 02:10:45,595
Is he...? Is he alive?

1571
02:10:45,965 --> 02:10:47,057
The monk?

1572
02:10:50,637 --> 02:10:53,572
Bishop, how would you know
this killer's name?

1573
02:10:55,141 --> 02:10:56,836
Get me out of here, Fache.

1574
02:10:57,410 --> 02:10:58,399
Wait.

1575
02:11:01,915 --> 02:11:04,907
Langdon never came to you
in confession, did he?

1576
02:11:05,652 --> 02:11:09,850
One of your followers called you
about the crime-scene photos.

1577
02:11:10,757 --> 02:11:15,717
I cannot be implicated here. There are
still important works to be done.

1578
02:11:17,497 --> 02:11:18,794
You used me.

1579
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:22,725
God uses us all.

1580
02:11:23,536 --> 02:11:25,060
Help me, Fache.

1581
02:11:26,239 --> 02:11:27,297
Take him.

1582
02:11:32,011 --> 02:11:33,842
- Did you get his cell phone?
- Yes, sir.

1583
02:11:34,047 --> 02:11:36,072
I'm going to need a trace.

1584
02:11:38,952 --> 02:11:40,749
Your Silas is dead.

1585
02:11:47,894 --> 02:11:49,623
The Priory's sacred charge...

1586
02:11:49,829 --> 02:11:52,855
...was to reveal the heir
at the dawn of the new millennium.

1587
02:11:53,866 --> 02:11:58,997
The millennium came and went
and the living heir remained hidden.

1588
02:11:59,205 --> 02:12:03,107
The Priory failed
in their sacred charge.

1589
02:12:03,910 --> 02:12:05,935
So, what choice did I have?

1590
02:12:10,216 --> 02:12:12,013
I sought out the enemy.

1591
02:12:13,486 --> 02:12:17,889
I persuaded them, the Council
of Shadows, that I was an ally.

1592
02:12:18,458 --> 02:12:22,155
I even asked them for money
so they would never suspect me.

1593
02:12:22,662 --> 02:12:25,631
Rector, I made them call me.

1594
02:12:26,199 --> 02:12:27,166
"Teacher."

1595
02:12:27,433 --> 02:12:28,661
- Why don't you and l...
- No.

1596
02:12:28,868 --> 02:12:31,428
Robert, no words. On your knees.

1597
02:12:31,904 --> 02:12:33,064
Do it.

1598
02:12:33,639 --> 02:12:35,004
No, I mean it. Down.

1599
02:12:36,075 --> 02:12:38,873
Not you. No, my dear, you...

1600
02:12:41,547 --> 02:12:43,913
You're my miracle, Sophie.

1601
02:12:44,584 --> 02:12:47,018
You're the guardian of the Grail.

1602
02:12:47,987 --> 02:12:51,479
All the oppression of the poor
and the powerless...

1603
02:12:51,691 --> 02:12:54,558
...of those of different skin,
of women.

1604
02:12:54,761 --> 02:12:57,992
You can put an end to all that.

1605
02:12:58,197 --> 02:13:01,894
You must explode the truth
onto the world.

1606
02:13:02,702 --> 02:13:04,169
It's your duty.

1607
02:13:07,106 --> 02:13:09,836
You know the answer to this riddle.

1608
02:13:11,310 --> 02:13:12,800
Open the cryptex...

1609
02:13:14,447 --> 02:13:16,108
...and I'll put down the gun.

1610
02:13:34,300 --> 02:13:36,268
I have no idea how.

1611
02:13:36,469 --> 02:13:38,334
I don't know the code.

1612
02:13:38,538 --> 02:13:41,200
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

1613
02:13:46,846 --> 02:13:49,144
Like your grandfather, then.

1614
02:13:49,882 --> 02:13:52,851
Willing to die for your secret.

1615
02:13:54,020 --> 02:13:57,512
But by the way you've been
looking at your hero...

1616
02:13:57,723 --> 02:14:02,456
...I wonder, would you
let him die for you?

1617
02:14:02,862 --> 02:14:05,057
Open it, Sophie, to save his life.

1618
02:14:05,264 --> 02:14:07,391
- Leigh, you can't just...
- Open the cryptex.

1619
02:14:08,067 --> 02:14:09,056
I don't know how.

1620
02:14:09,268 --> 02:14:11,168
Open it or he dies.

1621
02:14:11,370 --> 02:14:13,270
- I swear, I don't know.
- Do it! Do it!

1622
02:14:13,473 --> 02:14:14,770
- Stop it!
- I don't know!

1623
02:14:14,974 --> 02:14:16,305
Stop it!

1624
02:14:21,881 --> 02:14:23,872
She can't do it, Leigh.

1625
02:14:35,928 --> 02:14:37,725
But give me a moment.

1626
02:14:47,907 --> 02:14:49,534
Robert.

1627
02:15:02,722 --> 02:15:03,848
What are you doing?

1628
02:15:04,657 --> 02:15:05,817
Please.

1629
02:16:26,038 --> 02:16:27,471
I'm sorry.

1630
02:16:37,650 --> 02:16:38,742
I'm sorry.

1631
02:16:41,754 --> 02:16:43,187
No!

1632
02:16:51,230 --> 02:16:52,390
No, Robert!

1633
02:16:53,399 --> 02:16:54,661
No!

1634
02:16:55,568 --> 02:16:56,535
No.

1635
02:16:57,036 --> 02:16:59,231
Oh, the map. It's ruined.

1636
02:17:06,679 --> 02:17:08,146
The map is ruined.

1637
02:17:09,081 --> 02:17:10,412
The Grail.

1638
02:17:11,017 --> 02:17:12,143
It's lost.

1639
02:17:12,852 --> 02:17:14,319
The Grail is gone.

1640
02:17:14,687 --> 02:17:17,417
Only the won'thy
find the Grail, Leigh.

1641
02:17:18,524 --> 02:17:20,082
You taught me that.

1642
02:17:23,629 --> 02:17:24,721
Armed police!

1643
02:17:24,930 --> 02:17:27,262
Drop it! Drop your weapon!

1644
02:17:27,566 --> 02:17:28,965
Put the gun down.

1645
02:17:31,704 --> 02:17:34,036
Put the gun down.

1646
02:17:38,811 --> 02:17:41,575
That one. The old man.

1647
02:17:41,781 --> 02:17:42,748
You're under arrest!

1648
02:17:42,948 --> 02:17:45,143
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defense...

1649
02:17:45,351 --> 02:17:47,251
...if you do not mention,
when questioned...

1650
02:17:47,453 --> 02:17:49,444
...something which you
later rely on in court.

1651
02:17:49,655 --> 02:17:52,317
Anything you do say
will be given in evidence.

1652
02:18:03,002 --> 02:18:05,300
I'll have some questions for you.

1653
02:18:40,706 --> 02:18:43,174
Big crowd out there now.

1654
02:18:43,776 --> 02:18:47,212
Thank you for your statements.
You are free to go, of course.

1655
02:18:56,288 --> 02:18:58,916
I'm sorry. You thought
he was your friend, no?

1656
02:18:59,191 --> 02:19:01,625
It wasrt only us, was it?

1657
02:19:03,262 --> 02:19:04,923
He used you too.

1658
02:19:07,066 --> 02:19:08,624
Leave us, please.

1659
02:19:11,804 --> 02:19:12,793
Leave us, please.

1660
02:19:24,283 --> 02:19:26,843
I should have been smarter.

1661
02:19:27,052 --> 02:19:29,384
I acted on faith, I suppose.

1662
02:19:30,289 --> 02:19:31,654
I'm sorry.

1663
02:19:32,925 --> 02:19:34,517
How many?

1664
02:19:34,727 --> 02:19:37,890
Your grandfather, the other three,
maybe more.

1665
02:19:39,198 --> 02:19:43,635
The monk was given to Teabing
as a gift, it seems.

1666
02:19:44,970 --> 02:19:47,165
To do as he asked.

1667
02:19:47,473 --> 02:19:50,704
Teabing killed the servant himself,
you know.

1668
02:19:50,910 --> 02:19:53,708
- Remy?
- Yes.

1669
02:19:53,913 --> 02:19:54,937
By poison.

1670
02:19:57,750 --> 02:20:00,241
How much of it
have you been able to figure out?

1671
02:20:01,320 --> 02:20:05,154
Some. Not enough for it
to make sense.

1672
02:20:06,292 --> 02:20:07,850
It won't ever make sense.

1673
02:20:19,271 --> 02:20:20,431
I'm sorry.

1674
02:20:35,421 --> 02:20:38,447
He forgot everything we've learned.

1675
02:20:39,158 --> 02:20:41,217
Everything we teach.

1676
02:20:44,396 --> 02:20:47,160
It's why we study history.

1677
02:20:47,967 --> 02:20:50,993
So we'll stop killing each other.

1678
02:21:13,092 --> 02:21:16,789
Robert! Robert! Robert!
How could you do it?

1679
02:21:16,996 --> 02:21:19,157
How could you? Robert!

1680
02:21:19,598 --> 02:21:21,896
To destroy our hope of freedom.

1681
02:21:22,301 --> 02:21:25,600
To deny every pilgrim the chance
to kneel at the tomb of the Magdalene.

1682
02:21:25,804 --> 02:21:26,998
How could you?

1683
02:21:31,744 --> 02:21:33,678
You couldn't! You solved it.

1684
02:21:36,148 --> 02:21:39,606
You took the scroll out
before it broke!

1685
02:21:39,818 --> 02:21:43,777
You solved it. Oh, you'll find it, Robert.
You'll find it. You know what to do.

1686
02:21:43,989 --> 02:21:46,219
You'll find the Grail,
you'll kneel before her...

1687
02:21:46,425 --> 02:21:48,450
...and you'll set her free
upon the world!

1688
02:21:48,661 --> 02:21:52,062
That man there,
he's got the map to the Holy Grail!

1689
02:22:02,575 --> 02:22:07,478
There was every orb conceivable
on that tomb except one:

1690
02:22:08,414 --> 02:22:12,578
The orb which fell from the heavens
and inspired Newtors life's work.

1691
02:22:12,785 --> 02:22:17,654
Work that incurred the wrath
of the Church until his dying day.

1692
02:22:20,926 --> 02:22:22,393
A-P-P-L-E.

1693
02:22:23,495 --> 02:22:24,689
Apple.

1694
02:22:39,311 --> 02:22:42,280
The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits

1695
02:22:42,481 --> 02:22:44,847
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates

1696
02:22:45,050 --> 02:22:47,109
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies

1697
02:22:47,319 --> 02:22:51,187
She rests at last
beneath the starry skies

1698
02:22:52,825 --> 02:22:54,759
I think I know where she's gone.

1699
02:22:55,661 --> 02:22:58,186
I think the Grail has gone home.

1700
02:23:18,050 --> 02:23:22,885
Built by the Templars themselves.
Named for the original Rose Line.

1701
02:23:23,088 --> 02:23:24,953
Rosslyn Chapel.

1702
02:23:26,091 --> 02:23:27,854
So this is it.

1703
02:23:28,861 --> 02:23:30,726
The gift at the end.

1704
02:23:31,697 --> 02:23:35,428
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits."

1705
02:23:36,368 --> 02:23:39,599
You never told me the joke
Sauniere made of you.

1706
02:23:39,872 --> 02:23:41,169
What was it?

1707
02:23:41,707 --> 02:23:43,607
He called me a flatfoot.

1708
02:23:43,909 --> 02:23:46,173
A beat cop of history.

1709
02:23:46,912 --> 02:23:48,971
Oh, a dumb policeman...

1710
02:23:49,181 --> 02:23:52,582
...who just does his job
day after day, of history.

1711
02:23:52,785 --> 02:23:56,551
You know, his father was one.
A policeman.

1712
02:23:57,189 --> 02:24:01,922
Sauniere said he was the most
honorable man he had ever known.

1713
02:24:05,798 --> 02:24:08,460
We are who we protect, I think.

1714
02:24:09,401 --> 02:24:11,130
What we stand up for.

1715
02:24:23,048 --> 02:24:24,447
Jewish...

1716
02:24:25,551 --> 02:24:28,281
...Christian, Egyptian...

1717
02:24:29,588 --> 02:24:31,988
...Masonic, pagan...

1718
02:24:33,058 --> 02:24:34,787
...Templar crosses...

1719
02:24:35,394 --> 02:24:36,793
...pyramids.

1720
02:24:44,536 --> 02:24:48,302
I think I've been here before.

1721
02:24:48,507 --> 02:24:49,633
Sophie.

1722
02:25:09,528 --> 02:25:11,223
A very long time ago.

1723
02:25:13,599 --> 02:25:15,362
Come along, Sophie.

1724
02:25:30,616 --> 02:25:31,674
Sophie.

1725
02:25:32,718 --> 02:25:33,844
Over here.

1726
02:25:41,593 --> 02:25:45,188
"The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates."

1727
02:25:45,564 --> 02:25:47,998
Pagan symbols for
male and female.

1728
02:25:50,002 --> 02:25:51,765
Fused as one.

1729
02:25:52,204 --> 02:25:54,297
As the pagans would have wanted.

1730
02:25:55,941 --> 02:25:57,670
We're about to close, I'm afraid.

1731
02:26:03,916 --> 02:26:06,248
We're just gonna be a moment.

1732
02:26:55,467 --> 02:26:56,764
Robert.

1733
02:27:29,968 --> 02:27:31,765
I've never seen that before.

1734
02:27:37,042 --> 02:27:39,374
The style is...

1735
02:27:40,879 --> 02:27:42,471
It's unmistakable.

1736
02:27:51,723 --> 02:27:53,987
These could have been painted by
Leonardo da Vinci.

1737
02:27:56,128 --> 02:27:59,222
"Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies."

1738
02:27:59,798 --> 02:28:05,600
"She rests at last
beneath the starry skies."

1739
02:28:24,389 --> 02:28:26,084
The fleur-de-lis.

1740
02:29:17,175 --> 02:29:18,164
She was here.

1741
02:29:21,279 --> 02:29:22,837
Her sarcophagus.

1742
02:29:24,983 --> 02:29:26,575
Mary Magdalene.

1743
02:29:28,286 --> 02:29:30,311
The Holy Grail herself.

1744
02:29:31,890 --> 02:29:33,414
She was here.

1745
02:29:40,665 --> 02:29:44,829
With modern DNA testing,
those bones...

1746
02:29:45,037 --> 02:29:48,529
...could have shown definitive proof
of a bloodline.

1747
02:29:50,742 --> 02:29:52,369
Where did she go?

1748
02:29:53,412 --> 02:29:55,778
Did the Church finally get her?

1749
02:30:10,362 --> 02:30:12,887
This is incredible. Look at this.

1750
02:30:13,098 --> 02:30:16,397
Look at this. These records
go back thousands of years.

1751
02:30:17,669 --> 02:30:20,502
They date back
to the death of Christ.

1752
02:30:22,808 --> 02:30:26,175
Good God, could these
really be the Grail documents?

1753
02:30:48,233 --> 02:30:52,499
What did he want from us?
To find her sarcophagus?

1754
02:30:53,505 --> 02:30:56,201
How was I ever supposed
to figure all this out?

1755
02:30:56,641 --> 02:30:59,041
When you and your
grandfather fought...

1756
02:30:59,244 --> 02:31:01,940
...was it something about your past?

1757
02:31:03,782 --> 02:31:05,545
How could you know that?

1758
02:31:06,251 --> 02:31:08,981
About how your parents died?

1759
02:31:09,988 --> 02:31:11,649
Sophie?

1760
02:31:13,925 --> 02:31:16,155
It was during primary school.

1761
02:31:17,762 --> 02:31:19,753
I was in his library.

1762
02:31:21,566 --> 02:31:23,056
Doing research.

1763
02:31:23,268 --> 02:31:25,896
I was trying to find out
about my family.

1764
02:31:26,104 --> 02:31:28,334
Sophie, where are you, princess?

1765
02:31:29,174 --> 02:31:31,472
I wanted to know about them.

1766
02:31:32,177 --> 02:31:34,168
But I couldn't find any records.

1767
02:31:35,347 --> 02:31:37,247
Not of their death...

1768
02:31:38,717 --> 02:31:40,582
...not of the accident.

1769
02:31:41,253 --> 02:31:43,585
I'd asked him for as long
as I could remember...

1770
02:31:43,788 --> 02:31:45,085
...but he would never tell me.

1771
02:31:45,290 --> 02:31:46,951
I told you, no.

1772
02:31:49,427 --> 02:31:50,860
But why can't I?

1773
02:31:51,229 --> 02:31:53,060
He stood over me...

1774
02:31:54,799 --> 02:31:56,824
...and he wouldn't let me leave.

1775
02:31:57,035 --> 02:31:58,832
They're dead. Dead and buried.

1776
02:31:59,371 --> 02:32:00,998
Never look for them, Sophie.

1777
02:32:01,306 --> 02:32:02,466
Promise me.

1778
02:32:03,975 --> 02:32:05,033
Swear it!

1779
02:32:05,810 --> 02:32:06,902
Swear it to me!

1780
02:32:17,589 --> 02:32:19,557
I kept my promise.

1781
02:32:23,195 --> 02:32:25,993
The next week he sent me
to boarding school.

1782
02:32:27,699 --> 02:32:31,066
One weekend
I came home unexpectedly.

1783
02:32:32,204 --> 02:32:35,002
And what I saw
my grandfather doing...

1784
02:32:35,974 --> 02:32:37,566
Some ritual.

1785
02:32:39,611 --> 02:32:41,169
I was so frightened.

1786
02:32:45,884 --> 02:32:48,045
We hardly ever spoke again.

1787
02:32:51,790 --> 02:32:56,818
Do you have any memories of your
grandfather before the accident?

1788
02:32:57,896 --> 02:33:00,091
Before your parents were killed?

1789
02:33:00,799 --> 02:33:03,359
Yeah. No. I don't know.

1790
02:33:04,536 --> 02:33:05,628
Why?

1791
02:33:08,406 --> 02:33:10,772
Because I don't think
he was your grandfather.

1792
02:33:30,262 --> 02:33:32,230
These are my parents.

1793
02:33:34,399 --> 02:33:35,730
My brother.

1794
02:33:37,435 --> 02:33:39,232
And this is you, isn't it?

1795
02:33:44,209 --> 02:33:47,872
The paper says
the entire family was killed.

1796
02:33:48,380 --> 02:33:52,214
The mother, the father, the boy, 6...

1797
02:33:54,052 --> 02:33:56,316
...and the girl, 4.

1798
02:33:57,922 --> 02:34:02,518
But your name was never Sauniere.
It's Saint-Clair.

1799
02:34:05,964 --> 02:34:08,296
It's one of the oldest families
in France.

1800
02:34:08,967 --> 02:34:12,698
It's from a line of the
Merovingian kings.

1801
02:34:21,313 --> 02:34:23,110
Royal blood.

1802
02:34:25,150 --> 02:34:26,742
I was so wrong.

1803
02:34:28,386 --> 02:34:32,686
Sauniere didn't want you to help guard
the secret of the Holy Grail.

1804
02:34:34,426 --> 02:34:35,723
Sophie...

1805
02:34:38,263 --> 02:34:40,390
...you are the secret.

1806
02:34:41,766 --> 02:34:44,234
You survived the accident.

1807
02:34:44,502 --> 02:34:47,130
If it even was an accident.

1808
02:34:47,339 --> 02:34:49,273
The Priory found out.

1809
02:34:49,908 --> 02:34:53,071
Somehow they concealed
the fact that you were alive.

1810
02:34:53,678 --> 02:34:56,977
They hid you with the
Grand Master himself...

1811
02:34:57,515 --> 02:34:59,676
...who raised you as his own.

1812
02:35:00,752 --> 02:35:02,549
According to all of this...

1813
02:35:04,089 --> 02:35:05,716
...Princess Sophie...

1814
02:35:09,494 --> 02:35:10,961
...you are the heir.

1815
02:35:13,298 --> 02:35:15,163
The end of the bloodline.

1816
02:35:16,835 --> 02:35:20,100
You are the last living descendent...

1817
02:35:21,272 --> 02:35:23,103
...of Jesus Christ.

1818
02:36:08,586 --> 02:36:09,951
What is this?

1819
02:36:11,990 --> 02:36:13,218
Sophie?

1820
02:36:16,428 --> 02:36:17,520
Who are you?

1821
02:36:17,729 --> 02:36:20,197
There have been many names.

1822
02:36:20,732 --> 02:36:22,529
The keepers.

1823
02:36:23,401 --> 02:36:24,868
Guardians.

1824
02:36:25,270 --> 02:36:27,534
The Priory of Sion.

1825
02:36:27,906 --> 02:36:33,208
But to you, Sophie, we are friends
of the man who raised you:

1826
02:36:33,678 --> 02:36:35,270
Jacques Sauniere.

1827
02:36:37,715 --> 02:36:43,017
He would have wanted you to know
that he loved you very much.

1828
02:36:43,955 --> 02:36:47,914
And that the Priory are here
to protect you now...

1829
02:36:48,126 --> 02:36:51,289
...as they have always
protected our family.

1830
02:36:53,865 --> 02:36:55,958
I gave you up once...

1831
02:36:56,768 --> 02:36:59,794
...knowing I might
never see you again.

1832
02:37:03,274 --> 02:37:05,174
I'm your grandmother, Sophie.

1833
02:37:06,377 --> 02:37:11,679
I have prayed for this moment
for a very long time.

1834
02:37:13,384 --> 02:37:15,511
Welcome home, child.

1835
02:37:39,577 --> 02:37:40,635
Hey.

1836
02:37:43,147 --> 02:37:44,705
No more strings.

1837
02:37:49,254 --> 02:37:52,655
His last breath to keep me safe.

1838
02:37:56,995 --> 02:38:01,193
She has some things
she wants to tell me.

1839
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:04,366
About my family.

1840
02:38:10,742 --> 02:38:11,868
What will you do?

1841
02:38:13,011 --> 02:38:16,742
The legend will be revealed
when the heir reveals himself.

1842
02:38:17,549 --> 02:38:19,983
They just got the pronoun wrong.

1843
02:38:23,321 --> 02:38:25,016
She said when Sauniere died...

1844
02:38:25,223 --> 02:38:28,989
...he took the location
of Mary's sarcophagus with him.

1845
02:38:29,193 --> 02:38:33,129
So there's no way to empirically prove
that I am related to her.

1846
02:38:35,300 --> 02:38:37,234
What would you do, Robert?

1847
02:38:38,202 --> 02:38:42,434
Okay, maybe there is no proof.
Maybe the Grail is lost forever.

1848
02:38:42,640 --> 02:38:46,872
But, Sophie, the only thing that
matters is what you believe.

1849
02:38:47,879 --> 02:38:50,905
History shows us
Jesus was an extraordinary man...

1850
02:38:51,115 --> 02:38:53,083
...a human inspiration. That's it.

1851
02:38:53,918 --> 02:38:56,614
That's all the evidence
has ever proved.

1852
02:38:58,156 --> 02:38:59,248
But...

1853
02:39:00,224 --> 02:39:02,089
...when I was a boy...

1854
02:39:04,495 --> 02:39:08,955
When I was down in that well
Teabing told you about...

1855
02:39:11,569 --> 02:39:14,333
...I thought I was going to die,
Sophie.

1856
02:39:16,307 --> 02:39:17,740
What I did...

1857
02:39:18,476 --> 02:39:19,841
...I prayed.

1858
02:39:21,346 --> 02:39:25,442
I prayed to Jesus to keep me alive...

1859
02:39:25,650 --> 02:39:27,379
...so I could see my parents again...

1860
02:39:27,585 --> 02:39:30,145
...so I could go to school again...

1861
02:39:30,588 --> 02:39:32,852
...so I could play with my dog.

1862
02:39:34,258 --> 02:39:37,557
Sometimes I wonder
if I wasrt alone down there.

1863
02:39:39,464 --> 02:39:42,194
Why does it have to be
human or divine?

1864
02:39:42,400 --> 02:39:44,300
Maybe human is divine.

1865
02:39:45,603 --> 02:39:47,434
Why couldn't Jesus
have been a father...

1866
02:39:47,639 --> 02:39:50,437
...and still been capable
of all those miracles?

1867
02:39:50,875 --> 02:39:53,400
Like turning water into wine?

1868
02:39:53,778 --> 02:39:57,407
Well, who knows?
His blood is your blood.

1869
02:39:57,615 --> 02:40:00,743
Maybe that junkie in the park
will never touch a drug again.

1870
02:40:01,352 --> 02:40:04,344
Maybe you healed my phobia
with your hands.

1871
02:40:04,555 --> 02:40:07,718
And maybe you're
a knight on a Grail quest.

1872
02:40:10,395 --> 02:40:13,125
Well, here's the question:

1873
02:40:13,898 --> 02:40:16,594
A living descendent
of Jesus Christ...

1874
02:40:18,136 --> 02:40:20,661
...would she destroy faith?

1875
02:40:21,239 --> 02:40:24,902
Or would she renew it?

1876
02:40:26,711 --> 02:40:29,942
So again I say, what matters
is what you believe.

1877
02:40:32,216 --> 02:40:33,513
Thank you.

1878
02:40:35,653 --> 02:40:36,881
For bringing me here.

1879
02:40:39,090 --> 02:40:41,581
For letting him choose you...

1880
02:40:42,293 --> 02:40:43,487
...Sir Robert.

1881
02:40:53,771 --> 02:40:54,738
You take care.

1882
02:40:56,340 --> 02:40:57,466
Yes.

1883
02:41:22,166 --> 02:41:23,292
Hey.

1884
02:41:36,280 --> 02:41:37,247
Nope.

1885
02:41:38,549 --> 02:41:40,813
Maybe I'll do better with the wine.

1886
02:41:44,355 --> 02:41:45,720
Godspeed.

1887
02:42:44,482 --> 02:42:45,779
Bloodline.

1888
02:42:49,320 --> 02:42:50,685
Rose Line.

1889
02:42:57,461 --> 02:42:59,292
"Hides beneath the Rose."

1890
02:44:58,082 --> 02:45:01,677
"The Holy Grail 'neath
ancient Roslin waits.

1891
02:45:04,755 --> 02:45:08,156
Adorned in masters'
loving art, she lies.

1892
02:45:24,208 --> 02:45:27,837
The blade and chalice
guarding o'er her gates.

1893
02:46:07,351 --> 02:46:11,151
She rests at last
beneath starry skies."
