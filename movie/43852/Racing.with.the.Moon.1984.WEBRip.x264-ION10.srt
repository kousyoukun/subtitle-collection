ABOUT MY AUNT IDA?

BEFORE MY MA DIED,

221
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:29,222
DURING CHRISTMAS
WE HAD THESE FAMILY THINGS.

222
00:16:29,256 --> 00:16:31,124
MY AUNT IDA
WAS ALWAYS THERE

223
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,659

MISTLETOE HAT.

I THEORIZED MY AUNT

232
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,410
BECAUSE THEY ALL DIED
IN JANUARY AND FEBRUARY,

233
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:52,412
AND SHE WAS KISSING
IN DECEMBER.

234

A DEFINITE CAUSE

00:24:15,254 --> 00:24:16,823
OH, GRETCHEN.

356
00:24:16,856 --> 00:24:18,791
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

357
00:24:18,825 --> 00:24:20,226
BLIND DATES AGAIN.

358
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,161
I HATE NEW
TOWNS.

359
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24,997
WE'LL HAVE A BALL.
I PROMISE.

360
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,699
JUST ONE
NIGHT,
RIGHT?

361
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:29,702
HE'S SHIPPING OUT.
YOU'LL NEVER
SEE HIM AGAIN.

362
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:31,103
AND YOU'LL
BE THERE?

363
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,271
EVERY SECOND.
I PROMISE.

364
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,640
OK.

365
00:24:33,673 --> 00:24:36,008
THANKS,
CADDIE!
HE'S A DREAM.

366
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:38,044
IF HE
WASN'T
MY COUSIN,

367
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:40,046
I'D GO
OUT
WITH HIM.

368
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,749
HE LOOKS
JUST LIKE
ROBERT WALKER.

369
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,116
I
BET.

370
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,818
WELL, SORT OF.

371
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:48,621
WHO ARE YOU
GOING WITH?

372
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:50,022
I THOUGHT
BOBBY MICHAELS,

373
00:24:50,056 --> 00:24:53,092
BUT HE'S
SWORN OFF WOMEN
FOR THE DURATION.

374
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:55,161
THIS WAR'S
DRIVING THEM CRAZY.

375
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:56,996
DATE SOMEONE
FROM THE THEATER.

376
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,998
TOO FRESH.
EDDIE RICHARDS TRIED

377
00:24:59,031 --> 00:25:01,534
TO DRAG ME
BEHIND
THE POPCORN MACHINE.

378
00:25:01,568 --> 00:25:03,970
YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE IN THE BOOTH.

379
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,572
INSIDE IT'S HELL.

380
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:08,841
HEY,
WHAT ABOUT THIS GUY?

381
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:11,678
HENRY? YOU KNOW HIM?

382
00:25:11,711 --> 00:25:15,147
WE SORT
OF RAN
INTO EACH OTHER
AT THE LIBRARY.

383
00:25:15,181 --> 00:25:18,150
HENRY NASH?
I DIDN'T THINK
HE COULD READ.

384
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:21,153
HE'S SORT OF
CUTE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

385
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:25,758
WELL...YEAH,
BUT I COULDN'T
JUST ASK HIM.

386
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:28,895
LEAVE IT TO ME.
I'LL DO IT.

387
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:30,597
WATCH THIS.

388
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,833
UM...HENRY?

389
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:38,270
I HAVE TO APOLOGIZE.

390
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,872
I WAS RUDE EARLIER.

391
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:41,307
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

392
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,275
MY NAME'S
CADDIE WINGER.

393
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:45,077
HENRY NASH.

394
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:47,079
IT'S A PLEASURE, HENRY.

395
00:25:47,113 --> 00:25:49,749
ARE YOU
WORKING
THIS AFTERNOON?

396
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,150
WORKING?

397
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,753
YEAH, YOU WORK HERE,
DON'T YOU?

398
00:25:53,786 --> 00:25:55,121
OH, LAST NIGHT.

399
00:25:55,154 --> 00:25:57,156
I WAS JUST
HELPING OUT.

400
00:25:57,189 --> 00:25:58,658
THAT WAS NICE.

401
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:00,326
I DO WHAT I CAN.

402
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:04,196
HENRY, I DON'T SUPPOSE
YOU'RE FREE
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

403
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,767
YOU'RE
PROBABLY
SPENDING IT
WITH YOUR FAMILY.

404
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,902
MY FAMILY.
RIGHT. NO.

405
00:26:09,936 --> 00:26:11,237
OH, NO?

406
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,840
I MEAN I WOULD
BE,

407
00:26:13,873 --> 00:26:16,275
BUT MY MOM--
THAT'S MY MOTHER--

408
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:19,245
SHE'LL BE
WORKING
WITH THE USO
THAT NIGHT.

409
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:21,781
AND DAD...

410
00:26:21,814 --> 00:26:23,582
DAD'S, UH...

411
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,719
DAD'S GOING FISHING.

412
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:28,120
FISHING?

413
00:26:28,154 --> 00:26:29,922
ON
CHRISTMAS EVE?

414
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:30,923
YEAH.

415
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,625
AT NIGHT?

416
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,127
YEAH, IT'S KIND
OF
A TRADITION.

417
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:38,197
OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE
TURKEY ON CHRISTMAS.

418
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,332
WE HAVE FISH.

419
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:41,934
OH.

420
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,369
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

421
00:26:43,402 --> 00:26:47,273
WELL, THEN YOU
ARE
FREE CHRISTMAS EVE?

422
00:26:47,306 --> 00:26:48,407
DEFINITELY.

423
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,976
YOU WANT TO GO
OUT?

424
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,410
DEFINITELY.

425
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:54,013
GREAT. I
BELIEVE
YOU KNOW GRETCHEN.

426
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,748
HI, HENRY.

427
00:26:55,782 --> 00:26:56,949
HI.

428
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:00,386
YOU TWO WILL HAVE
A WONDERFUL TIME.

429
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:02,254
IT'S
PERFECT.
SO ANYWAY,

430
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:03,956
WE'LL SEE YOU THERE.

431
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:08,360
YEAH,
OK.
SEE YOU THERE.

432
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,663
OK...OK.

433
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:13,065
OH, HENRY,
WE'RE GOING
ROLLER-SKATING.

434
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:14,667
WE'LL MEET AT
7:00.

435
00:27:14,701 --> 00:27:16,936
YOU DO ROLLER-SKATE,
DON'T YOU?

436
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,170
SURE.

437
00:27:35,121 --> 00:27:38,090
YOU LOOK LIKE A USED CAR
SALESMAN.

438
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:41,093
WHERE ARE
YOU GOING
DRESSED LIKE THAT?

439
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:42,695
I GOT A DATE.

440
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:43,963
WITH WHO?

441
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,232
A GIRL.

442
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:48,835
WHAT ARE
YOU,
MR. DISTRICT ATTORNEY?

443
00:27:48,868 --> 00:27:51,838
A BOY SHOULD
STAY
HOME WITH HIS FAMILY

444
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:53,105
ON CHRISTMAS EVE.

445
00:27:53,139 --> 00:27:55,708
I'LL BE HOME
ALL DAY TOMORROW.

446
00:27:55,742 --> 00:27:57,844
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

447
00:27:57,877 --> 00:27:59,111
HEY.

448
00:27:59,145 --> 00:28:02,048
OH, HI, DAD.
THANKS FOR THE FLOWERS.

449
00:28:02,081 --> 00:28:04,450
YOU LOOK
JUST LIKE I DID

450
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:07,453
THE FIRST TIME
I WORE THAT SUIT.

451
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,055
ISN'T IT TOO
BIG?

452
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,456
YOU'LL GROW INTO IT.

453
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,891
BY 8:00?

454
00:28:58,537 --> 00:29:01,207
OH, THERE HE IS.
I SEE HIM.

455
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,109
HEY,
NASH!

456
00:29:19,425 --> 00:29:21,828
YOU GOT
YOUR SKATES.

457
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:24,196
YEAH. THEY WOULDN'T
LET ME IN

458
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,833
UNLESS I
PUT
THEM ON FIRST.

459
00:29:26,866 --> 00:29:28,267
THIS IS
MICHAEL.

460
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,368
HENRY NASH.

461
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,303
GLAD TO MEET
YOU.

462
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:33,906
MICHAEL JUST
GOT HIS WINGS.

463
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,241
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

464
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,242
THANKS.

465
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:38,244
WHAT BRANCH
ARE YOU JOINING?

466
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,345
MARINES.

467
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:40,980
TOUGH GROUP.

468
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:43,950
I'LL TRY NOT TO
DROP ANYTHING ON YOU.

469
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,053
SORRY, EVERYBODY.

470
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,320
HI, HENRY.

471
00:29:48,354 --> 00:29:49,922
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

472
00:29:49,956 --> 00:29:52,024
OH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL!

473
00:29:52,058 --> 00:29:53,993
WHERE DID
YOU GET THEM?

474
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,996
I JUST KIND OF
PICKED THEM UP.

475
00:29:57,029 --> 00:29:58,998
HENRY'S VERY BIG
ON FLOWERS.

476
00:29:59,031 --> 00:30:00,833
AREN'T YOU?

477
00:30:00,867 --> 00:30:03,269
YEAH, SURE.

478
00:30:03,302 --> 00:30:04,837
UM...

479
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:06,238
WELL, UM...

480
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:07,907
SHALL WE?

481
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,475
ALL RIGHT.

482
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,848
SOMETHING WRONG?

483
00:30:15,882 --> 00:30:17,249
UH,
NO.
GO AHEAD.

484
00:30:17,283 --> 00:30:20,152
I'M JUST GOING
TO WARM UP.

485
00:30:20,186 --> 00:30:21,854
OK.

486
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,865
HEY, MISTER,
LEAVE ME ALONE.

487
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:50,482
HEY.

488
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:52,584
LET GO OF MY HAND!

489
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,996
LET GO OF MY
HAND!

490
00:31:09,001 --> 00:31:10,937
LET GO!

491
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:21,080
THAT LOOKED SCARY.

492
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:24,650
ONLY IF YOU
DON'T
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

493
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,252
THAT WAS GREAT.

494
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,087
THANKS VERY MUCH.

495
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,022
ANYONE FEEL
LIKE A BREATHER?

496
00:31:30,056 --> 00:31:31,357
I
WOULDN'T MIND.

497
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:35,027
GRETCH, I GUESS
IT'S YOU AND ME.

498
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:36,395
YOU DAMN MARINES.

499
00:31:36,428 --> 00:31:38,364
YOU NEED
A HAND, HUH?

500
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:39,999
I DO, YES.

501
00:31:50,576 --> 00:31:54,146
HEY, BUDDY,
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
OUT ON THE FLOOR

502
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,547
WITHOUT ANY SKATES!

503
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,649
RELAX. I'M LEAVING.

504
00:32:00,719 --> 00:32:02,088
HERE.

505
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,094
MUST'VE GOTTEN
BAD SKATES.

506
00:32:08,127 --> 00:32:09,495
YEAH. MM-HMM.

507
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,267
SO TELL
ME
ABOUT MICHAEL.

508
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,437
WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO KNOW
ABOUT MICHAEL?

509
00:32:19,538 --> 00:32:21,507
UH...

510
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,509
LIKE...

511
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,513
LIKE IS HE MY BOYFRIEND?

512
00:32:27,546 --> 00:32:29,215
EXCUSE ME?

513
00:32:32,551 --> 00:32:35,287
SO YOUR DAD'S OUT
FISHING TONIGHT?

514
00:32:35,321 --> 00:32:37,523
FISHING. RIGHT. NO.

515
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:39,158
NO?

516
00:32:39,191 --> 00:32:41,027
I SORT
OF LIED.

517
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:44,130
YOU DID?
WHY
DID YOU DO THAT?

518
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,470
WHAT DOES
YOUR DAD DO?

519
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,577
HE'S A GRAVE DIGGER.

520
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,180
IT'S NOT ALL
JUST DIGGING HOLES.

521
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:04,516
THERE'S THE GRASS
AND FLOWERS TO LOOK AFTER.

522
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,552
TREES ALWAYS NEED
CUTTING BACK.

523
00:33:06,585 --> 00:33:09,521
BEING NEAR THE OCEAN
MAKES EVERYTHING GROW FASTER.

524
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,123
THAT'S WHAT HE SAYS.

525
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:15,127
HE KEEPS IT REAL NICE.

526
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,429
IT'S A NICE
PLACE.

527
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:20,132
WHY DON'T
YOU TAKE
ME THERE SOMETIME?

528
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:25,304
SHE'S
A GATSBY GIRL.

529
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,705
IF YOU
ASK ME,

530
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:29,708
YOU'RE BARKING
UP THE WRONG
PAIR OF GAMS.

531
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,043
WHO ASKED?

532

00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:32,978
HOT.

710
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:34,680
I'M SO HOT.

711
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:42,087
I DON'T HAVE
MY BATHING SUIT ON.

712
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:43,088
OH.

713
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,656
WELL...

714
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:48,994
ME AND NICKY
NEVER USED TO WEAR
BATHING SUITS.

715
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:50,361
OH.

716
00:43:59,337 --> 00:44:00,438
ALL RIGHT.

717
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:03,408
YOU CAN WEAR
YOUR UNDERSTUFF,

718
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:06,111
SEEING THIS IS
JANUARY
AND ALL.

719
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:21,392
WHOO! WHOO!

720
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,997
COME
ON!
IT'S GREAT!

721
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,271
COME
ON!

722
00:44:34,472 --> 00:44:36,407
HOO HOO!

723
00:44:38,376 --> 00:44:40,011
HURRY UP.

724
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,315
JUST JUMP
IN.

725
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,992
IT'S REALLY COLD.

726
00:44:56,928 --> 00:44:58,196
SO...

727
00:44:58,229 --> 00:45:01,166
DOES ANYBODY
ELSE
KNOW ABOUT THIS PLACE?

728
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,400
I DON'T THINK SO.

729
00:45:02,433 --> 00:45:05,403
I GUESS WE HAVE
IT
TO OURSELVES, THEN.

730
00:45:05,436 --> 00:45:07,372
YEAH. I GUESS
SO.

731
00:45:11,777 --> 00:45:13,144
IT'S THAT NOT
BAD.

732
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,747
I'M GETTING
USED TO IT.

733
00:45:15,781 --> 00:45:18,750
YOUR BODY
JUST
HAS TO ADJUST.

734
00:45:18,784 --> 00:45:23,021
WHAT MADE YOU THINK
OF COMING HERE?

735
00:45:23,054 --> 00:45:24,455
I DON'T KNOW.

736
00:45:24,489 --> 00:45:26,992
IT'S ONE
OF
MY FAVORITE PLACES.

737
00:45:31,797 --> 00:45:33,765
YOU'RE SHAKING.

738
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:35,733
SO ARE YOU.

739
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:20,138
SHE'S A NICE
GIRL.

740
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:22,540
AND MONEY
ON TOP OF IT.

741
00:47:22,573 --> 00:47:24,375
YOU'RE LUCKY, HOP.

742
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:30,281
I THINK SHE'S
THE ONE, NICKY.

743
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:33,151
YOU KNOW WHAT I
MEAN?

744
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:37,956
JOHNNY
LESTER
CAME IN TODAY.

745
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,391
HIS BROTHER'S DEAD.

746
00:47:40,425 --> 00:47:42,327
TOMMY?

747
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,096
HE
DIED
ON AN ISLAND.

748
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,899
GUADEL--OR...

749
00:47:47,933 --> 00:47:49,000
GUODO--

750
00:47:49,034 --> 00:47:50,335
GUADALCANAL.

751
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:52,637
YEAH.

752
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:54,172
FUNERAL'S
TOMORROW.

753
00:47:54,205 --> 00:47:56,207
WE'RE INVITED.
WANT TO GO?

754
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:58,476
I DON'T
THINK SO.

755
00:47:58,509 --> 00:48:00,645
ME EITHER.

756
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:15,226
YOU KNOW
WHAT I WANT, HENRY?

757
00:48:15,260 --> 00:48:17,628
I WANT AN EAGLE
RIGHT HERE.

758
00:48:17,662 --> 00:48:19,464
A TATTOO. YEAH.

759
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:23,068
WAIT TILL THOSE JAPS
SEE ME AND MY EAGLE

760
00:48:23,101 --> 00:48:25,070
COME CHARGING
OVER THE HILL.

761
00:48:25,103 --> 00:48:27,572
JUST COME
CHARGING OVER THE HILL.

762
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:33,411
THERE'S A WAR
OUT THERE SOMEWHERE, HOP.

763
00:48:38,016 --> 00:48:40,385
SO, THEY'RE
IN THIS SUBMARINE, RIGHT?

764
00:48:40,418 --> 00:48:44,389
THE JAPS ARE GOING AT
THEM
WITH EVERYTHING THEY GOT.

765
00:48:44,422 --> 00:48:47,993
GUYS ARE DROWNING, ON FIRE,
AND THEY GOT GUNS,

766
00:48:48,026 --> 00:48:50,996
SO YOU KNOW
WHAT TYRONE POWER SAYS?

767
00:48:51,029 --> 00:48:53,999
HE SAYS "FUCK
'EM!"
JUST LIKE THAT.

768
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:56,401
TYRONE POWER NEVER
SAID "FUCK 'EM."

769
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:58,403
THAT'S WHEN HE DOES IT.

770
00:48:58,436 --> 00:49:01,339
HE SERVES A MEAL
IN TOKYO HARBOR.

771
00:49:01,372 --> 00:49:03,208
JEEZ! WHAT BALLS!

772
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:06,211
MAYBE WE
SHOULD JOIN
THE SUBMARINE CORPS.

773
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:07,445
PUSSIES.

774
00:49:09,114 --> 00:49:10,081
WHAT?

775
00:49:10,115 --> 00:49:12,350
THEY'RE PUSSIES!

776
00:49:12,383 --> 00:49:16,087
NO.
TYRONE POWER
IS NOT A PUSSY.

777
00:49:16,121 --> 00:49:19,490
YOU WOULDN'T
KNOW A PUSSY
IF YOU SAW ONE.

778
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:20,491
OH, YEAH?

779
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:22,093
YEAH. YOU KNOW
WHY?

780
00:49:22,127 --> 00:49:23,494
YOU KNOW
WHY?

781
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:25,496
BECAUSE
YOU DRINK TOO MUCH.

782
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,697
ME?

783
00:49:26,731 --> 00:49:30,501
PISSES ME
OFF.
PISSES ME OFF BADLY

784
00:49:30,535 --> 00:49:33,104
'CAUSE WHEN
YOU
DRINK TOO MUCH

785
00:49:33,138 --> 00:49:35,106
IT MAKES YOUR BRAIN
SOFT.

786
00:49:35,140 --> 00:49:38,209
LET ME--I GOT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

787
00:49:39,744 --> 00:49:42,513
BEFORE I STARTED
DRINKING,
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

788
00:49:42,547 --> 00:49:45,116
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO DO THAT?

789
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:46,617
IT GIVES ME PLEASURE.

790
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,521
OH, WOWIE!

791
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:52,357
WOWIE!

792
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:55,793
RIGHT HERE...

793
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,529
CLEAR ACROSS
MY GOD DAMN CHEST.

794
00:49:58,563 --> 00:50:00,131
A REAL PATRIOT,
HUH?

795
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,132
DAMN RIGHT.

796
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,533
IN JUST FOUR WEEKS,

797
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:04,102
WE'LL BE PROUD
MEMBERS

798
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:06,471
OF THE UNITED STATES
MARINE CORPS.

799
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,705
LUCKY US.

800
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,706
UH-HUH!

801
00:50:08,739 --> 00:50:10,175
LISTEN, KID.

802
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:12,577
I'LL DO YOU A FAVOR.

803
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:15,713
I'M NOT PUTTING
ANYTHING ON YOUR CHEST.

804
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,049
THAT WAY,
IN THE MORNING,

805
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:21,086
YOU'LL STILL HAVE THAT
WONDERFUL BABY PINK SKIN.

806
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:23,221
YOU'LL THANK
ME,
BELIEVE ME.

807
00:50:23,254 --> 00:50:26,757
THIS IS
THE BIRD OF FREEDOM
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

808
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:29,760
ANY AMERICAN
WOULD BE PROUD
TO CARRY THAT.

809
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:32,763
YOU OUGHT TO CUT
DOWN
ON THE NEWSREELS.

810
00:50:32,797 --> 00:50:35,366
YOU GIVE TATTOOS
OR ADVICE?

811
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,603
ALL RIGHT. HOW
MUCH
HAVE YOU BOYS GOT?

812
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:43,641
I...UH...

813
00:50:43,674 --> 00:50:46,344
UM, I
GOT $1.25.

814
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:48,346
I GOT 13 CENTS.

815
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:53,351
$1.38
WILL GET YOU
A SPARROW ON YOUR ELBOW.

816
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:54,752
A SPARROW?

817
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:58,623
OR HOW ABOUT A
SNAKE
COMING OUT OF YOUR NAVEL?

818
00:50:58,656 --> 00:51:00,758
YOU'VE
GOT TO BE KIDDING!

819
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,827
HE'S
KIDDING,
RIGHT, HOP?

820
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:07,332
I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE HIGH-FLYING
BIRD OF FREEDOM!

821
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:10,501
BIRD OF
FREEDOM
DON'T COME CHEAP.

822
00:51:11,836 --> 00:51:13,238
BAH-HUH!

823
00:51:15,306 --> 00:51:18,276
A SNAKE COMING
OUT OF MY NAVEL.

824
00:51:18,309 --> 00:51:20,745
HE'S PROBABLY
SOME KIND OF NAZI.

825
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:27,218
HEY...LISTEN.

826
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:29,820
IT'S THE TRAIN.

827
00:51:29,854 --> 00:51:32,423
TOUCH THE RAIL
WITH YOUR SHOE.

828
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:34,125
YOU CAN FEEL IT.

829
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:41,499
LET'S RACE IT,
LIKE WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

830
00:51:41,532 --> 00:51:43,301
WE'RE DRUNK.

831
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:46,704
WHO CARES?
I WANT TO RACE IT.

832
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,306
WE'LL GET KILLED.

833
00:51:48,339 --> 00:51:49,874
NO, WE WON'T.

834
00:51:49,907 --> 00:51:52,310
THIS TRAIN'S
AN OLD FRIEND.

835
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:54,812
IT WOULD
NEVER HURT US.

836
00:51:54,845 --> 00:51:57,315
HERE SHE COMES!

837
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,716

SHE'S LATE, HOP.

853
00:53:57,768 --> 00:53:59,904
WHAT?

854
00:53:59,937 --> 00:54:01,672
SALLY.
SHE'S PREGNANT.

855
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:03,674
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

856
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,676
THREE WEEKS

00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:08,279
AND SHE HITS ME
WITH THIS.

858
00:54:08,313 --> 00:54:10,281
YOU GOT

HELP ME, HOP.

859
00:54:10,315 --> 00:54:12,283
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

860
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:13,684
TO GET
THE MONEY.

861
00:54:13,718 --> 00:54:14,919
THE MONEY?

862
00:54:14,952 --> 00:54:16,687
FOR AN
ABORTION.

863
00:54:16,721 --> 00:54:18,956
AN
ABORTION?
NICKY.

864
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:20,958
DIDN'T YOU
USE ANYTHING?

865
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:22,560
IT JUST
HAPPENED.

866
00:54:22,593 --> 00:54:25,563
YOU'VE BEEN
SEEING THIS GIRL
FOR FOUR MONTHS!

867
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:26,631
SO?

868
00:54:26,664 --> 00:54:28,633

00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:37,375
NO. SHE'S
PAYING
FOR IT, NICKY!

872
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:39,610
SHE'S PAYING FOR IT.

873
00:54:39,644 --> 00:54:43,748
HOP, SINCE WHEN DID YOU
BECOME SUCH A SAINT?

874
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,015
HUH, HOP?

875
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:48,018
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN ME AND YOU

876
00:54:48,052 --> 00:54:50,621
IS YOU'VE BEEN LUCKY,
THAT'S ALL!

877
00:54:50,655 --> 00:54:52,423
THAT'S IT, HOP!

878
00:55:20,518 --> 00:55:21,786
HOW MUCH?

879
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:25,022
EDDIE SAYS IT
COSTS 150
FOR A CLEAN ONE.

880
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:28,025
150? WHERE ARE WE
GOING TO GET THAT?

881
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,027
WE'LL DO LIKE WE DID

882
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,630
WHEN
WE NEEDED
A NEW TRANSMISSION.

883
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,031
WE ALMOST
GOT KILLED!

884
00:55:34,064 --> 00:55:36,467
WHAT
OTHER WAY
IS THERE?

885
00:55:44,675 --> 00:55:46,377
I'LL
THINK
ABOUT IT.

886
00:55:46,411 --> 00:55:47,545
COME ON.

887
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,905
MY DEAR FRIENDS IN CHRIST,

WE ARE GATHERED HERE TODAY

WHO GAVE HIS LIFE IN THE
SERVICE OF HIS COUNTRY.

891
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:28,919
WE ASK GOD
TO WATCH OVER HIM. AMEN.

892
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:32,056
TO THE FLAG,
FACE!

893
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,658

HUT!

904
00:57:09,527 --> 00:57:11,462
HELLO THERE,
STRANGER.

905
00:57:13,931 --> 00:57:16,000
YOU UP EARLY OR LATE?

906
00:57:17,201 --> 00:57:18,603
LATE.

907
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,939
LET YOUR MOTHER
KNOW NEXT TIME.

908
00:57:21,972 --> 00:57:23,173
OK.

909
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,512
YOU WANT TO TALK?

910
00:57:41,626 --> 00:57:43,027
LET'S HURRY,
NURSES.

911
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,563
WE DON'T
WANT
TO LOSE ANYONE.

912
00:57:45,596 --> 00:57:46,964
MORE VOLUME,
ARNOLD!

913
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:47,965
#[ROCKET FALLING]

914
00:57:47,998 --> 00:57:49,266
#[BOOM]

915
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,268
REMEMBER, SOLDIERS,
IF YOU'RE WOUNDED,

916
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:55,072
REMAIN LYING DOWN
UNTIL A NURSE REACHES YOU.

917
00:57:56,541 --> 00:58:00,778
IF YOU'RE DEAD,
REMAIN LYING DOWN.

918
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:04,148
TRY TO GIVE COMFORT
TO YOUR PATIENTS.

919
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,551
REMEMBER, BLOOD
DOESN'T BOTHER YOU

920
00:58:06,584 --> 00:58:09,186
BECAUSE YOU ARE
PROFESSIONAL NURSES.

921
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,590
HE MIGHT BE DEAD
ALREADY. SORRY.

922
00:58:12,623 --> 00:58:14,091
WHERE
ARE YOU HURT?

923
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:15,660
HE SLIPPED AWAY.

924
00:58:15,693 --> 00:58:16,994
I'M COMING AROUND.

925
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:18,596
I'LL
COME BACK
LATER.

926
00:58:18,629 --> 00:58:20,965
WAIT. I'LL SHOW YOU
MY WOUND.

927
00:58:20,998 --> 00:58:22,567
R.D., STOP.

928
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,968
GET ON.

929
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,871
GO TO THE
RECORDS.

930
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:28,573
OW! OW! OW!

931
00:58:28,606 --> 00:58:31,308
YOU'RE
LOOKING
AFTER SICK MEN,
SO BE CAREFUL.

932
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:33,143
THAT'S
THE IDEA.

933
00:58:34,745 --> 00:58:36,146
THAT'S
THE IDEA.

934
00:58:36,180 --> 00:58:39,684
YOU
MIGHT GET
SOME BANDAGES.

935
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,085
YOUR
MOTHER
JUST CALLED.

936
00:58:41,118 --> 00:58:42,653
WHAT ABOUT MY RECORDS?

937
00:58:42,687 --> 00:58:44,655
WE'LL WATCH THEM
FOR YOU.

938
00:58:44,689 --> 00:58:46,056
IT'S
AN EMERGENCY.

939
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,057
BUT--

940
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:48,659
NO BUTS!
HOP TO IT!

941
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,628
HURRY. BERLIN
BLITZ IS ENDING.

942
00:58:50,661 --> 00:58:53,564
PREPARE FOR THE
WORST
SHELLING YET.

943
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:57,635
#

944
00:58:57,668 --> 00:59:00,638
#

945
00:59:00,671 --> 00:59:04,041
# HE WAS A FAMOUS TRUMPET
MAN FROM OUT CHICAGO WAY

946
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:06,711
# HE HAD A BOOGIE SOUND
THAT NO ONE ELSE COULD PLAY

947
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:09,614
# HE WAS A TOP MAN
OF HIS CRAFT

948
00:59:09,647 --> 00:59:11,015
WHAT'S GOING
ON HERE?

949
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,283
STOP THAT CARRYING ON!

950
00:59:13,317 --> 00:59:14,985
YOU JUST HOLD IT!

951
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:17,955
# HE'S THE BOOGIE-WOOGIE
BUGLE BOY FROM COMPANY B

952
00:59:17,988 --> 00:59:19,223
STOP THAT!

953
00:59:27,765 --> 00:59:30,735
OH!

954
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:32,136
THAT'S NOT
FUNNY.

955
00:59:32,169 --> 00:59:33,738
IT'S A JOKE.

956
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:35,039
IT'S NOT
FUNNY.

957
00:59:35,072 --> 00:59:36,741
IT'S NOT A FUNNY JOKE?

958
00:59:36,774 --> 00:59:39,777
NO. YOU
KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY
STUPID SOMETIMES.

959
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:42,212
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

960
00:59:42,246 --> 00:59:44,815
WHAT ARE
YOU
DOING RIGHT NOW?

961
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:46,150
BLEEDING.

962
00:59:46,183 --> 00:59:50,054
GET YOURSELF CLEANED
UP
AND MEET ME OUTSIDE.

963
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:51,355
WHERE ARE WE
GOING?

964
00:59:51,388 --> 00:59:52,923
YOU'LL SEE.

965
00:59:56,093 --> 00:59:57,662
IT'S A HOSPITAL.

966
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,029
THAT'S
RIGHT.
SMART.

967
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:00,665
I'M SMART.

968
01:00:00,698 --> 01:00:01,966
SMARTER
THAN YOU LOOK.

969
01:00:01,999 --> 01:00:04,034
I'M SMARTER
THAN I LOOK.

970
01:00:04,068 --> 01:00:05,636
THAT'S GOOD.

971
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:06,937
BEEP BEEP!

972
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:09,006
GOOD
IDEA.

973
01:00:09,039 --> 01:00:11,308
I'M HAVING
A REAL GOOD TIME.

974
01:00:11,341 --> 01:00:14,278
I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HAVING FUN.

975
01:00:14,311 --> 01:00:16,013
HI!

976
01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:19,850
YOU
KNOW
WHO'S IN HERE?

977
01:00:19,884 --> 01:00:21,185
SICK PEOPLE.

978
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:23,120
YOU WANT TO GO
IN?

979
01:00:23,153 --> 01:00:24,421
YOU BET.

980
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,023
OK.

981
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,660
HERE WE ARE.

982
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:37,067
[WHISTLES]

983
01:00:37,101 --> 01:00:39,303

01:00:45,743 --> 01:00:47,812
HEY, HENRY.

988

HE'S MY BODYGUARD,

989
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:52,817
ALL RIGHT?

990
01:00:52,850 --> 01:00:55,853
SO DON'T TRY
ANY FUNNY STUFF.

991
01:00:55,886 --> 01:00:58,856
HENRY, GIVE
EACH PERSON A BOOK.

992
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:01,826
LEAVE ONE
ON THE EMPTY BEDS.

993
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:02,860
GOOD.

994
01:01:02,893 --> 01:01:04,061
HI.

995
01:01:12,269 --> 01:01:14,204
OH, GOOD. YOU FOUND IT.

996
01:01:14,238 --> 01:01:16,073
IT WAS
ON ORDER.

997
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,345
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE?

998
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:23,313
YOU GOT
ANY HAMMETT?

999
01:01:23,347 --> 01:01:24,815
HAMMETT?

01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:26,183
YEAH.
DASHIELL HAMMETT.

01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:30,788
I'LL CHECK THE CART.

1002
01:01:30,821 --> 01:01:32,222
THAT'S OK.

1003
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:34,224
IT'LL JUST TAKE A SECOND.

1004
01:01:34,258 --> 01:01:35,826
RELAX. FORGET
IT.

1005
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,194
WHAT'S YOUR
NAME?

1006
01:01:38,262 --> 01:01:39,797
HENRY, SIR.

1007
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:43,768
HOW OLD
ARE YOU?

1008
01:01:43,801 --> 01:01:45,235
17, SIR.

1009
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:48,338
HOW OLD
DO YOU THINK I AM?

1010
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,377
I'M
22.

1011
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:57,481
YOU CALL
EVERYBODY
WHO'S 22 SIR?

1012
01:01:57,514 --> 01:02:00,084
NO, SIR.
I MEAN, NO.

1013
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:04,054
MY NAME'S
FRANK.

1014
01:02:04,088 --> 01:02:07,391
GUESS
THEY'LL BE
CALLING YOU UP SOON.

1015
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:09,960
FEBRUARY 12th.

1016
01:02:13,998 --> 01:02:16,233
GO AHEAD. LOOK AT
IT.

1017
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:19,870
I DO...

1018
01:02:19,904 --> 01:02:21,505
ALL DAY
LONG.

1019
01:02:23,573 --> 01:02:26,877
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW,
I CAN STILL FEEL IT.

1020
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:28,512
THAT'S THE GOD'S
TRUTH.

1021
01:02:31,181 --> 01:02:35,119
ONLY
HALF-BELIEVE
IT'S GONE.

1022
01:02:35,152 --> 01:02:36,553
YOU GET
IT?

1023
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,522
HALF?

1024
01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:48,432
JUST
GIVE ME
WHATEVER
YOU GOT THERE.

1025
01:02:48,465 --> 01:02:49,867
THANKS.

1026
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:00,177
HENRY.

1027
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:13,190
THERE'S A TRAIN
THAT RUNS THROUGH HERE.

1028
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:14,591
A FREIGHT.

1029
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:18,295
ME AND NICKY RACED IT
ABOUT A HUNDRED TIMES.

1030
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:21,431
YOU CAN FEEL THE HEAT
ON YOUR LEGS.

1031
01:03:21,465 --> 01:03:23,433
GONDOLA CAR'S
YOUR BEST BET.

1032
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:25,035
IT'S GOT THESE HANDLES.

1033
01:03:25,069 --> 01:03:28,038
ONCE YOU GET YOUR GRIP,
IT'S EASY.

1034
01:03:28,072 --> 01:03:30,607
PULL UP,
LET HER TAKE YOU.

1035
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:34,511
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL,
THE WIND BLOWS YOU UNDER.

1036
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,014
THAT
SOUNDS
DANGEROUS.

1037
01:03:37,047 --> 01:03:39,283
THAT'S WHY WE DID IT.

1038
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:43,120
I DIDN'T NEED YOU
TO TEACH ME SOME LESSON.

1039
01:03:45,589 --> 01:03:47,457
I'M
SORRY.

1040
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:50,627
I'M
SORRY I TOOK
YOU IN THERE.

1041
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:54,598
IT'S
JUST, YOU
MADE ME SO MAD
THIS MORNING.

1042
01:03:58,135 --> 01:04:01,405
HOW COME YOU
NEVER
TALK ABOUT IT?

1043
01:04:01,438 --> 01:04:02,506
WHAT?

1044
01:04:02,539 --> 01:04:04,108
THE WAR.

1045
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,110
WHAT'S THERE
TO TALK ABOUT?

1046
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,112
YOU
MUST
THINK ABOUT IT.

1047
01:04:08,145 --> 01:04:11,115
I THINK ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.

1048
01:04:11,148 --> 01:04:13,083
I MEAN, BEFORE,
IT WAS JUST THERE.

1049
01:04:13,117 --> 01:04:15,019
BUT NOW,
BEING AROUND YOU,

1050
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:16,987
I THINK ABOUT THINGS.

1051
01:04:18,422 --> 01:04:21,091
LIKE
WHAT SORT
OF THINGS?

1052
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,495
COMING BACK.

1053
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:30,300
I'M GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW?

1054
01:05:55,752 --> 01:06:00,057
TANGERINE

1055
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:05,329
SHE IS ALL THEY CLAIM

1056
01:06:05,362 --> 01:06:07,731
WITH HER EYES OF NIGHT

1057
01:06:07,764 --> 01:06:13,070
AND LIPS AS BRIGHT
AS FLAME

1058
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:17,607
TANGERINE

1059
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:22,479
WHEN SHE DANCES BY

1060
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:25,049
SEÃ±ORITAS STARE

1061
01:06:25,082 --> 01:06:30,187
AND CABALLEROS SIGH

1062
01:06:30,220 --> 01:06:34,591
AND I'VE SEEN

1063
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:39,729
TIMES WHEN TANGERINE

1064
01:06:39,763 --> 01:06:42,399
HAD THE BOURGEOISIE

1065
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:48,272
BELIEVING SHE WERE QUEEN

1066
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:52,676
YES, SHE'S HAD THEM
ALL
ON THE RUN

1067
01:06:52,709 --> 01:06:57,147
BUT HER HEART
BELONGS TO JUST ONE

1068
01:06:57,181 --> 01:07:03,787
HER HEART
BELONGS TO TANGERINE

1069
01:07:09,726 --> 01:07:10,827
NICKY!

1070
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:13,830
WHY DO I
LET YOU
WORK HERE?

1071
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:17,434
'CAUSE NOBODY LAYS DOWN
A SET OF PINS FASTER THAN ME.

1072
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:19,436
I'M THE BEST YOU GOT.

1073
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:20,604
NO,
YOU'RE NOT.

1074
01:07:20,637 --> 01:07:22,206
OH.

1075
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:25,575
WELL, THEN...
YOU GOT ME, BOSS.

1076
01:07:29,646 --> 01:07:31,181
SO?

1077
01:07:32,649 --> 01:07:34,351
SO WHAT?

1078
01:07:34,384 --> 01:07:36,753
YOU SAID
YOU'D THINK ABOUT IT.

1079
01:07:36,786 --> 01:07:38,355
ABOUT
WHAT?

1080
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:41,225
COME ON.
SALLY. THE MONEY.

1081
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:43,227
I AM THINKING ABOUT IT.

1082
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,630
HOP, WE ONLY
GOT
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

1083
01:07:46,663 --> 01:07:48,465
SHIT.

1084
01:08:12,289 --> 01:08:14,124
COME ON. GET UP.

1085
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:16,226
GET UP. WAIT.

1086
01:08:24,701 --> 01:08:26,136
GET UP.

1087
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:27,771
COME ON.

1088
01:08:29,473 --> 01:08:32,176
OK.
YOU'RE
GOING TO GET IT.

1089
01:08:32,209 --> 01:08:35,179
YOU ARE
GOING
TO BE SORRY.

1090
01:08:36,913 --> 01:08:38,482
YOU SEE
THIS?

1091
01:08:38,515 --> 01:08:39,849
OOH! I'M SORRY!

1092
01:08:39,883 --> 01:08:41,451
OH, I DIDN'T--

1093
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:42,819
OH, I'M SORRY.

1094
01:08:42,852 --> 01:08:44,421
LET ME SEE.

1095
01:08:44,454 --> 01:08:47,424
OH, I GOT YOU
IN THE EYE.

1096
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,692
IT HURTS.

1097
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:56,800
OH, LOOK AT THOSE
SHOES.
AREN'T THEY PRETTY?

1098
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,168
SEE?

1099
01:08:58,202 --> 01:09:00,470
DON'T YOU LIKE
THOSE?

1100
01:09:03,740 --> 01:09:05,275
I LOVE THOSE.

1101
01:09:05,309 --> 01:09:06,743
AREN'T THEY BEAUTIFUL?

1102
01:09:08,512 --> 01:09:09,779
HOW DO THEY FEEL?

1103
01:09:09,813 --> 01:09:11,548
I
LIKE THEM.

1104
01:09:14,418 --> 01:09:15,785
I LOVE THEM.

1105
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,521
#CERTO BENE!# OF COURSE!

1106
01:09:17,554 --> 01:09:19,523
THEY WERE MADE FOR YOU.

1107
01:09:19,556 --> 01:09:21,258
HOW MUCH ARE THEY?

1108
01:09:21,291 --> 01:09:22,759
$25.

1109
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:24,394
25.

1110
01:09:24,428 --> 01:09:26,930
NOT UNREASONABLE
FOR SUCH MARVELOUS WORK,

1111
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,632
DON'T YOU THINK?

1112
01:09:32,269 --> 01:09:33,637
NOT
UNREASONABLE.

1113
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,572
WELL,
THANK YOU.

1114
01:09:35,605 --> 01:09:36,973
THINK ABOUT IT.

1115
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,443
YOU'LL COME BACK,
I'M SURE.

1116
01:09:39,476 --> 01:09:40,944
OH,
THANK YOU.

1117
01:09:40,977 --> 01:09:43,380
WELL, ANYWAY...

1118
01:09:43,413 --> 01:09:44,781
IT'S A PLEASURE.

1119
01:09:44,814 --> 01:09:47,684
I LOVE
THEM.
THANKS A LOT.

1120
01:09:47,717 --> 01:09:48,818
GOODBYE.

1121
01:09:48,852 --> 01:09:50,254
GOODBYE, HENRY.

1122
01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:52,822
WHAT
HAPPENED?

1123
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:54,424
HMM?

1124
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,860
YOU
DIDN'T
BUY THE SHOES.

1125
01:09:56,893 --> 01:09:58,462
OF COURSE NOT.

1126
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:03,667
YOU CAN'T JUST BUY
EVERYTHING YOU WANT.

1127
01:10:03,700 --> 01:10:07,571
THAT'S
RIGHT.
I CAN.

1128
01:10:09,606 --> 01:10:12,742
I'M
JUST
KIDDING YOU,
GATSBY GIRL.

1129
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,751
WHAT? BUT HOW?

1130
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,453
I DON'T
KNOW.

1131
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:25,889
IT'S NOT
FUNNY.

1132
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,891
IT IS SORT OF FUNNY.

1133
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:29,025
IT
ISN'T.

1134
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:32,028
DID YOU EVER TELL HIM
YOU WERE RICH?

1135
01:10:32,061 --> 01:10:33,029
NO.

1136
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:35,632
THEN NO SKIN
OFF YOUR NOSE.

1137
01:10:35,665 --> 01:10:38,635
IF HE WANTS TO BELIEVE
YOU'RE RICH, LET HIM.

1138
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:42,406
AS FAR AS I SEE,
YOU'VE GOT NO PROBLEM.

1139
01:10:42,439 --> 01:10:44,741
MAYBE
THAT'S
WHY HE LIKES ME.

1140
01:10:44,774 --> 01:10:47,744
WELL, SO WHAT?
HE'S LEAVING SOON ANYWAY.

1141
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:50,980
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH HIM.

1142
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,591
UH-OH.

1143
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,595
$1.35, PLEASE.

1144
01:11:14,538 --> 01:11:15,805
HI,
HENRY.

1145
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,041
CADDIE.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
TO WORK TONIGHT.

1146
01:11:18,074 --> 01:11:20,644
I THOUGHT
MAYBE
WE COULD TALK.

1147
01:11:20,677 --> 01:11:22,045
KIND OF BUSY.

1148
01:11:22,078 --> 01:11:23,647
IS 1
OPEN?

1149
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,881
YEAH.

1150
01:11:26,082 --> 01:11:28,017
COMING TO MY BIRTHDAY
TOMORROW?

1151
01:11:28,051 --> 01:11:29,419
YEAH.

1152
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:32,055
NOT MUCH...
JUST YOU AND NICKY.

1153
01:11:32,088 --> 01:11:33,823
I WANTED TO TALK
BECAUSE...

1154
01:11:35,392 --> 01:11:38,027
I
GOT--
JUST SIT DOWN
A SECOND, OK?

1155
01:11:55,044 --> 01:11:56,713
BALL'S
COMING BACK.

1156
01:11:57,947 --> 01:11:59,883
WHAT ARE
YOU
DOING HERE?

1157
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:01,718
I NEED YOU.

1158
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,119
IT'S UNDER
CONTROL.

1159
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:05,422
NICKY, YOU PROMISED.

1160
01:12:05,455 --> 01:12:08,358
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO COME HERE.

1161
01:12:08,392 --> 01:12:09,859
YOU PROMISED.

1162
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,761
STOP
SAYING
I PROMISED YOU!

1163
01:12:11,795 --> 01:12:13,763
DON'T LEAVE ME
BY MYSELF.

1164
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:15,899
I'M NOT LEAVING
YOU
BY YOURSELF.

1165
01:12:15,932 --> 01:12:17,634
YOU'RE
GOING TO BE OK.

1166
01:12:21,605 --> 01:12:22,906
WOMEN.

1167
01:12:38,822 --> 01:12:40,390
THANK YOU.

1168
01:12:46,796 --> 01:12:48,732
WHAT'S THE
MATTER
WITH HER?

1169
01:12:48,765 --> 01:12:49,766
NOTHING.

1170
01:12:49,799 --> 01:12:50,900
HOPPER!

1171
01:12:52,836 --> 01:12:54,471
I GOT TO GO.

1172
01:12:54,504 --> 01:12:55,905
YOU LOOK
REAL PRETTY.

1173
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:06,550
I'LL
DO IT.

1174
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:37,981
THEY'RE TOO BIG.

1175
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:39,716
WHAT DO YOU
MEAN?

1176
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:42,786
YOU'LL SHOOT
POOL WITH THEM,
NOT WRESTLE THEM.

1177
01:13:42,819 --> 01:13:46,623
I'M THINKING ABOUT AFTER
I SHOOT POOL WITH THEM,

1178
01:13:46,656 --> 01:13:48,958
AND THEY REALIZE
THEY'VE BEEN HUSTLED.

1179
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:50,527
AND THEY WILL.

1180
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,562
THEY'RE JUST
TWO STUPID UNIFORMS.

1181
01:13:52,596 --> 01:13:55,565
BESIDES,
THERE'S A FIRE EXIT
RIGHT OVER THERE...

1182
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,200
JUST IN
CASE.

1183
01:14:07,977 --> 01:14:10,113
AFTERNOON, GENTS.

1184
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:13,049
SOMEONE SAID YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR A GAME.

1185
01:14:13,082 --> 01:14:14,684
SOMEONE SAID
WRONG.

1186
01:14:14,718 --> 01:14:16,720
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT

1187
01:14:16,753 --> 01:14:19,656
BECAUSE NAVY BOYS
DON'T HAVE THE SKILL

1188
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:21,090
TO PLAY FOR MONEY.

1189
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:24,060
ALL THAT TIME ON SHIPS
AFFECTS THEIR BALANCE.

1190
01:14:24,093 --> 01:14:26,696
THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG
WITH MY BALANCE.

1191
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:29,666
SURE. DON'T LET ME
HOLD UP YOUR GAME.

1192
01:14:35,772 --> 01:14:37,106
THAT'S A TOUGH BREAK.

1193
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,709
WANT TO
PLAY?
I'LL PLAY YOU.

1194
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,611
I GOT A BAD WRIST.

1195
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,479
MY FRIEND WILL PLAY.

1196
01:14:50,286 --> 01:14:52,021
HOW
ABOUT IT?

1197
01:14:52,055 --> 01:14:53,590
SURE.

1198
01:14:53,623 --> 01:14:55,191
GREAT.

1199
01:14:57,594 --> 01:14:58,995
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

1200
01:14:59,028 --> 01:15:00,263
BILL.

1201
01:15:00,296 --> 01:15:01,831
GLAD TO MEET YOU.

1202
01:15:01,865 --> 01:15:03,132
I'M BUD,

1203
01:15:03,166 --> 01:15:05,535
AND THAT'S LOU.

1204
01:15:05,569 --> 01:15:09,005
NOW THAT WE'RE FRIENDS,
LET'S GET DOWN TO BUSINESS.

1205
01:15:15,011 --> 01:15:16,713
HOW'S $5.00 SOUND?

1206
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:19,716
YEAH.
THAT SOUNDS OK.

1207
01:15:19,749 --> 01:15:21,250
8-BALL'S THE GAME.

1208
01:15:21,284 --> 01:15:24,821
YOU DO KNOW HOW TO PLAY,
DON'T YOU, BILL?

1209
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,255
I
KNOW HOW.

1210
01:15:26,289 --> 01:15:28,558
TERRIFIC.

1211
01:15:34,330 --> 01:15:36,800
8 IN THE
CORNER.

1212
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:38,935
20 BUCKS YOU OWE
ME.

1213
01:15:38,968 --> 01:15:40,937
NOW, WILLIAM,
NOT SO FAST.

1214
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,872
MY BOY'S
JUST WARMING UP.

1215
01:15:42,906 --> 01:15:45,875
HOW ABOUT
IF WE MAKE THINGS
MORE INTERESTING?

1216
01:15:45,909 --> 01:15:49,278
HOW ABOUT WE SEE
SOME GREEN ON THE TABLE?

1217
01:15:49,312 --> 01:15:51,881
DOES THIS
ANSWER YOUR QUESTION?

1218
01:15:51,915 --> 01:15:53,282
NOBODY TOUCHES MY MONEY.

1219
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:54,884
SOME OF THAT'S
MINE.

1220
01:15:54,918 --> 01:15:56,586
NOT YET IT AIN'T.

1221
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:59,088
10 BUCKS A GAME,
ALL RIGHT?

1222
01:16:00,624 --> 01:16:02,992
SHE DREAMED
ABOUT ME
LAST NIGHT.

1223
01:16:03,026 --> 01:16:04,594
SHIT.

1224
01:16:04,628 --> 01:16:06,996
NICKY,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

1225
01:16:07,030 --> 01:16:09,966
WOULD
YOU RELAX?
THIS IS PERFECT.

1226
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:14,938
EXCUSE ME, BOYS.

1227
01:16:14,971 --> 01:16:17,807
WE'VE GOT A LITTLE
CONTEST
GOING ON HERE.

1228
01:16:17,841 --> 01:16:19,809
I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE INTERESTED

1229
01:16:19,843 --> 01:16:21,210
IN A LITTLE ACTION.

1230
01:16:21,244 --> 01:16:23,913
WHAT KIND OF ACTION?

1231
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,382
IT JUST SO HAPPENS

1232
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:30,286
THAT YESTERDAY
MORNING
I SOLD MY CAR--

1233
01:16:30,319 --> 01:16:33,990
A DANDY LITTLE
1932 PLYMOUTH.

01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:16,058
#OFF TO MY LEFT,
FAR IN THE DISTANCE,

1407
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:19,795
#I CAN SEE THE FAINT RED
ANGRY SNAP OF ANTI-AIRCRAFT

1408
01:33:19,828 --> 01:33:21,930
#AGAINST
THIS STEEL-BLUE SKY.

1409
01:33:21,964 --> 01:33:25,200
# DOO DOO
DOODLY YA-DA DOO

1410
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:27,335
# HE BLOWS IT
EIGHT TO THE BAR

1411
01:33:27,369 --> 01:33:28,804
# IN BOOGIE RHYTHM

1412
01:33:28,837 --> 01:33:30,205
# HE CAN'T PLAY A NOTE

1413
01:33:30,238 --> 01:33:34,076
# UNLESS THE BASS AND
GUITAR ARE PLAYING WITH HIM

1414
01:33:34,109 --> 01:33:35,343
# HE MAKES
HIS COMPANY JUMP

1415
01:33:35,377 --> 01:33:36,679
# WHEN HE PLAYS
REVEILLE...

1416
01:33:36,712 --> 01:33:37,680
NICKY.

1417
01:33:37,713 --> 01:33:38,681
HUH?

1418
01:33:38,714 --> 01:33:39,982
WILL YOU STOP, PLEASE?

1419
01:33:40,015 --> 01:33:41,083
HUH?

1420
01:33:41,116 --> 01:33:43,051
STOP,
PLEASE.
STOP THE CAR.

1421
01:33:43,085 --> 01:33:44,286
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
CADDIE?

1422
01:33:44,319 --> 01:33:45,888
I WANT TO GET OUT.

1423
01:33:45,921 --> 01:33:47,856
IT'S
ONLY
A FEW BLOCKS.

1424
01:33:47,890 --> 01:33:49,925
WOULD YOU STOP
THE DAMN CAR?

1425
01:33:57,866 --> 01:33:59,835
CADDIE, WHERE ARE
YOU GOING?

1426
01:33:59,868 --> 01:34:00,836
HOME.

1427
01:34:00,869 --> 01:34:02,237
I'LL WALK YOU.

1428
01:34:02,270 --> 01:34:04,840
I DON'T
WANT
YOU TO WALK ME.

1429
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:07,843
YOU'RE THINKING
THAT YOU COULD'VE
BEEN IN THERE.

1430
01:34:07,876 --> 01:34:10,846
I'D NEVER TAKE YOU THERE.
I'D MARRY YOU.

1431
01:34:10,879 --> 01:34:14,249
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID?
I'D MARRY YOU.

1432
01:34:14,282 --> 01:34:17,252
WELL,
WHAT
MAKES YOU THINK
I'D MARRY YOU?

1433
01:34:17,285 --> 01:34:18,854
GET IN THE CAR.

1434
01:34:18,887 --> 01:34:19,855
NO.

1435
01:34:19,888 --> 01:34:21,857
GET IN THE GOD DAMN CAR!

1436
01:34:21,890 --> 01:34:23,358
LET GO!

1437
01:34:23,391 --> 01:34:24,993
OH, I'M
SORRY.

1438
01:34:25,027 --> 01:34:28,396
I DIDN'T
KNOW
YOU WOULD GO
INTO THAT PLACE.

1439
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:31,099
WHAT DO
YOU WANT
FROM ME?

1440
01:34:32,334 --> 01:34:34,402
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
FROM YOU.

1441
01:34:34,436 --> 01:34:37,405
HEY.
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

1442
01:34:37,439 --> 01:34:39,374
IT'S THE
MONEY,
RIGHT?

1443
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:43,879
YOU THINK I
TOOK
ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

1444
01:34:43,912 --> 01:34:45,881
CADDIE, WE
NEEDED
THAT MONEY.

1445
01:34:45,914 --> 01:34:48,884
YOU'RE THE
ONLY
RICH PERSON I KNOW.

1446
01:34:48,917 --> 01:34:50,886
YOU ARE
SUCH AN IDIOT.

1447
01:34:50,919 --> 01:34:52,988
I'M NOT RICH.

1448
01:34:54,056 --> 01:34:55,157
WHAT?

1449
01:34:55,190 --> 01:34:56,992
I'M NOT RICH.

1450
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58,894
WHAT ARE
YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

1451
01:34:58,927 --> 01:35:01,296
YES, I LIVE
IN THAT HOUSE.

1452
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:02,898
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

1453
01:35:02,931 --> 01:35:04,900
BECAUSE MY MOTHER
WORKS THERE.

1454
01:35:04,933 --> 01:35:06,902
MY MOM IS A MAID.

1455
01:35:06,935 --> 01:35:09,304
SHE'S A MAID
IN THAT HOUSE.

1456
01:35:09,337 --> 01:35:10,906
GOD DAMN YOU!

1457
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:12,808
I TRIED TO TELL YOU,

1458
01:35:12,841 --> 01:35:14,209
BUT YOU'RE SO PLEASED

1459
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:17,379
WITH YOUR LITTLE GIRL
ON THE HILL

1460
01:35:17,412 --> 01:35:20,382
THAT I DIDN'T WANT
TO DISAPPOINT YOU.

1461
01:35:28,323 --> 01:35:30,425
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.

1462
01:35:30,458 --> 01:35:32,127
LEAVE ME ALONE.

1463
01:35:39,201 --> 01:35:40,803
HOP, YOU COMING?

1464
01:35:40,836 --> 01:35:41,937
[HONK HONK]

1465
01:35:41,970 --> 01:35:43,105
HOP.

1466
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:59,421
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1467
01:35:59,454 --> 01:36:03,225
THAT'S MY OLD MAN'S CAR,
YOU CRAZY SON OF A BITCH!

1468
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:04,827
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

1469
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06,862
YOU, NICKY!
YOU'RE THE MATTER!

1470
01:36:06,895 --> 01:36:10,198
I'M ALWAYS
GETTING
YOU OUT OF MESSES!

1471
01:36:10,232 --> 01:36:11,099
IT'S OVER.

1472
01:36:11,133 --> 01:36:12,400
SHUT UP! SHUT
UP!

1473
01:36:12,434 --> 01:36:14,402
SALLY COULD
HAVE
DIED TONIGHT.

1474
01:36:14,436 --> 01:36:16,404
THAT EVER
CROSSED YOUR MIND?

1475
01:36:16,438 --> 01:36:18,106
BUT SHE DIDN'T!

1476
01:36:19,574 --> 01:36:22,510
JESUS, YOU JUST
DON'T
GET IT, DO YOU?

1477
01:36:22,544 --> 01:36:25,814
THEN YOU GET HER
MIXED UP IN IT.

1478
01:36:28,884 --> 01:36:33,388
I'M SICK OF
YOU
MESSING UP
MY LIFE, NICKY.

1479
01:36:33,421 --> 01:36:35,490
I'M SICK OF
IT.

1480
01:36:40,996 --> 01:36:45,067
YOU
DIDN'T EVEN
OPEN THE DOOR
FOR HER, NICKY.

1481
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:47,069
THE
GIRL
HAD AN ABORTION.

1482
01:36:47,102 --> 01:36:49,972
YOU
CAN'T EVEN
OPEN THE DOOR
FOR HER.

1483
01:37:19,434 --> 01:37:21,403
DAMN COLD
FOR FEBRUARY.

1484
01:37:21,436 --> 01:37:24,039
LAID A BED OF
THESE
LAST NIGHT.

1485
01:37:24,072 --> 01:37:27,209
THIS MORNING
THE GROUND WAS
STILL LIKE ROCK.

1486
01:37:27,242 --> 01:37:28,877
YOUR MOM
SAYS

1487
01:37:28,911 --> 01:37:32,114
NICKY'S BEEN
BY
THREE TIMES
THIS PAST WEEK.

1488
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:38,253
YOU
KNOW YOUR OWN MIND.

1489
01:37:38,286 --> 01:37:41,256
JUST SEEMS
YOU COULD USE
EACH OTHERS' COMPANY

1490
01:37:41,289 --> 01:37:42,490
ABOUT NOW.

1491
01:37:45,994 --> 01:37:48,964
FOR A TIME
RIGHT
AFTER HIS MOM DIED,

1492
01:37:48,997 --> 01:37:51,366
NICKY
BROUGHT
FLOWERS HERE
EVERY DAY.

1493
01:37:51,399 --> 01:37:53,969
COME AFTER
SCHOOL,
JUST SIT THERE.

1494
01:37:54,002 --> 01:37:55,370
HE'D BE SO
TIRED,

1495
01:37:55,403 --> 01:37:57,973
I'D HAVE TO
CARRY HIM HOME.

1496
01:37:58,006 --> 01:37:59,607
DID YOU KNOW
THAT?

1497
01:38:01,343 --> 01:38:04,546
YEAH, WELL, IT
WAS
A LONG TIME AGO.

1498
01:38:13,721 --> 01:38:16,358
DAMN COLD
FOR FEBRUARY.

1499
01:38:16,391 --> 01:38:17,559
YEAH.

1500
01:39:07,609 --> 01:39:09,277
HOW YOU DOING?

1501
01:39:11,213 --> 01:39:13,181
OK. YOU?

1502
01:39:13,215 --> 01:39:15,017
OK.

1503
01:39:16,218 --> 01:39:17,719
THURSDAY'S
THE BIG DAY.

1504
01:39:17,752 --> 01:39:19,421
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

1505
01:39:23,358 --> 01:39:24,592
YOU READY?

1506
01:39:24,626 --> 01:39:25,727
YOU BET.

1507
01:39:25,760 --> 01:39:27,162
ME, TOO.

1508
01:39:31,766 --> 01:39:34,169
I WENT
BY
AND SAW SALLY.

1509
01:39:34,202 --> 01:39:35,603
YEAH?

1510
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:39,474
JUST TO
SEE HOW
SHE WAS DOING
AND EVERYTHING.

1511
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:41,076
HOW IS SHE?

1512
01:39:41,109 --> 01:39:42,010
SHE'S GOOD.

1513
01:39:42,044 --> 01:39:43,378
THAT'S GOOD.

1514
01:39:46,314 --> 01:39:48,283
YOU KNOW
WHAT SHE SAID

1515
01:39:48,316 --> 01:39:50,285
JUST
BEFORE I LEFT?

1516
01:39:50,318 --> 01:39:54,289
SHE SAID, "TAKE
CARE
OF YOURSELF, NICK."

1517
01:39:54,322 --> 01:39:56,124
CAN YOU BEAT
THAT?

1518
01:40:08,336 --> 01:40:11,306
WE GOT TO STICK
TOGETHER, NICKY.

1519
01:40:11,339 --> 01:40:13,675
WE GOT
TO STICK TOGETHER.

1520
01:40:17,345 --> 01:40:19,013
YEAH.

1521
01:40:22,084 --> 01:40:23,418
YEAH.

1522
01:42:05,220 --> 01:42:07,689
WHY
DON'T YOU
TRY THEM ON?

1523
01:42:26,374 --> 01:42:29,177
I ALREADY
KNOW THEY FIT.

1524
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,695
I LOVE YOU,
CADDIE.

1525
01:42:49,897 --> 01:42:51,833
I LOVE YOU, HENRY.

1526
01:43:29,771 --> 01:43:31,339
DON'T
CRY, MOM.

1527
01:43:31,373 --> 01:43:32,740
I'M NOT
CRYING.

1528
01:43:32,774 --> 01:43:35,477
COME BACK
AND PLAY FOR ME.

1529
01:43:35,510 --> 01:43:36,978
BOARD!

1530
01:43:41,649 --> 01:43:42,950
KEEP YOUR EYES
PEELED.

I WILL, DAD.

1532
01:43:46,988 --> 01:43:48,556
YOU, TOO, NICKY.

1533
01:43:48,590 --> 01:43:50,258
I WILL, SIR.

1534
01:43:51,993 --> 01:43:53,661
TAKE CARE, NICKY.

1535
01:43:55,463 --> 01:43:57,665
I BROUGHT SOMETHING
FOR YOU.

1536
01:44:00,602 --> 01:44:02,804
IT'S FOR YOUR WALLET.

1537

ALL
ABOARD!

1538
01:44:18,353 --> 01:44:19,587

YOU BOYS
BETTER

BE SAFE.

1541
01:44:37,372 --> 01:44:39,341
SON,
YOUR TRAIN
IS LEAVING!

1542
01:44:39,374 --> 01:44:40,875
