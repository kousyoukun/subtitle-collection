1
00:03:55,947 --> 00:03:58,659
I have a meeting in a
few minutes...

2
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:01,286
with some very jittery
stockholders, Mattson.

3
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,207
I hope you have
good news for me.

4
00:04:04,332 --> 00:04:07,084
Yes, sir.
I do, sir.

5
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,921
Every tabloid’s running headlines
about Andy Barclay...

6
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:11,923
and his killer
Good Guy doll.

7
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:14,343
What about his mother
and the police?

8
00:04:14,426 --> 00:04:18,389
The police were smart. They denied
everything. They can't hurt us.

9
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,393
The mother backed up
her boy's story in court,

10
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,395
so she's under
psychiatric observation.

11
00:04:23,478 --> 00:04:24,938
Where's the boy now?

12
00:04:25,063 --> 00:04:27,942
Midtown Children's Crisis Center.
Foster custody's pending.

13
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,360
My stomach hurts,
Mattson.

14
00:04:29,485 --> 00:04:32,405
Is this what you
call good news?

15
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,407
No. I'm getting to that.

16
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,994
Our biggest problem
has been the rumors.

17
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,370
Good morning,
Mr. Sullivan.

18
00:04:38,495 --> 00:04:41,999
People are saying
that some joker at the company...

19
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:45,378
must have tampered
with the doll's voice cassette.

20
00:04:45,503 --> 00:04:47,005
''Hi. I'm Chucky.

21
00:04:47,088 --> 00:04:48,381
''I'm the Lakeshore Strangler.

22
00:04:48,506 --> 00:04:50,008
I'm going to kill you.''

23
00:04:50,092 --> 00:04:52,010
Something like--

24
00:04:52,094 --> 00:04:53,429
Well, something like that.

25
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:56,015
But the good news,
Mr. Sullivan,

26
00:04:56,098 --> 00:04:59,019
is that now
we've got the doll.

27
00:05:03,065 --> 00:05:05,401
We've rebuilt it
from head to toe.

28
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:08,404
A lot of it was
burned to a crisp,

29
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:10,239
but everything checks out--
voice cassette, servomechanisms--

30
00:05:10,364 --> 00:05:12,909
We've found absolutely nothing.
This is a quality control report.

31
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:15,537
I'm sure it will make
the stockholders very happy.

32
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,331
I want to see the doll.

33
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:18,666
Absolutely.

34
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:19,875
Absolutely.

35
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,170
Mr. Sullivan's here.
We ready?

36
00:05:22,295 --> 00:05:24,839
Give us a minute. We're not
used to making them manually.

37
00:05:50,285 --> 00:05:53,122
- What's wrong?
- I don't know. It's stuck.

38
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:54,331
Just--

39
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:57,126
They'll have this,
uh, worked out.

40
00:06:06,386 --> 00:06:08,931
- Oh! Oh!
- My God!

41
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,266
Oh, Jesus!

42
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:12,060
Oh!

43
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:14,270
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

44
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:17,941
Aah!

45
00:06:24,198 --> 00:06:27,160
Andy, you still dreaming
about Chucky?

46
00:06:27,244 --> 00:06:28,995
Sometimes.

47
00:06:30,122 --> 00:06:32,916
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

48
00:06:33,042 --> 00:06:34,377
Oh, come on, Andy.

49
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,379
Remember what I told you?

50
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:38,047
Talking helps make...

51
00:06:38,172 --> 00:06:40,342
the nightmares go away.

52
00:06:43,429 --> 00:06:47,893
Well, Chucky was trying
to take over my soul.

53
00:06:47,934 --> 00:06:49,185
Why?

54
00:06:49,269 --> 00:06:52,606
This bad man got
inside my Good Guy doll...

55
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:54,608
so he wouldn't
have to go to hell.

56
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:57,570
But then he wanted
to get inside me.

57
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:59,071
Why, Andy?

58
00:06:59,197 --> 00:07:02,534
'Cause if he stayed
inside the doll too long,

59
00:07:02,617 --> 00:07:04,452
he'd be trapped in there.

60
00:07:04,577 --> 00:07:09,833
He needed me 'cause I was the
first person he told his secret to.

61
00:07:09,917 --> 00:07:11,211
What secret?

62
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:14,839
That his real name
was Charles Lee Ray.

63
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:19,010
Boy, that's a scary dream.

64
00:07:19,094 --> 00:07:21,514
It was.

65
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:26,394
You know,
dreams can't hurt you.

66
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,440
Dreams aren't real.

67
00:07:29,523 --> 00:07:31,942
- Right?
- Right.

68
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,237
- In here.
- In there.

69
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,448
Let's hurry up.

70
00:07:40,327 --> 00:07:42,620
I don't care what it takes.

71
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:44,665
Put a lid on this.

72
00:07:44,915 --> 00:07:46,250
That's not a problem.

73
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,502
Listen to me.

74
00:07:47,627 --> 00:07:51,464
You smuggle this error
out of here in 24 hours.

75
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:55,093
- Yes, sir.
- Now if you will excuse me...

76
00:07:55,218 --> 00:07:57,138
I've got a meeting
I've got to get to.

77
00:07:57,221 --> 00:07:59,932
As far as the stockholders
and I are concerned,

78
00:08:00,057 --> 00:08:01,976
this matter is finished.

79
00:08:02,102 --> 00:08:05,939
What do you want me
to do with the doll?

80
00:08:06,023 --> 00:08:07,941
Stick it up your ass.

81
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:14,448
Naturally, he was badly traumatized
by the murders,

82
00:08:14,532 --> 00:08:17,452
but they bounce back
pretty fast at that age.

83
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:20,623
- Poor kid.
- What Andy needs now...

84
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:24,502
is a normal family environment,
a fresh start...

85
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:27,338
and a chance
to forget the past.

86
00:08:27,463 --> 00:08:29,841
Since you've done so well
with so many kids,

87
00:08:29,925 --> 00:08:33,512
we were hoping you'd foster him
until his mother recovers.

88
00:08:33,637 --> 00:08:36,390
- There's always room for one more.
- Mmm.

89
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,893
What does that mean?

90
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:42,272
Uh, well...

91
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:47,278
he seems... normal enough,
but how has all this affected him?

92
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,655
In order to come to terms...

93
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:52,284
with something he couldn't
possibly understand,

94
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:55,662
he turned it all into
a kind of fairy tale.

95
00:08:55,954 --> 00:09:00,167
He insisted his doll
was responsible.

96
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:02,211
He said it was possessed...

97
00:09:02,253 --> 00:09:05,173
by the soul
of Charles Lee Ray.

98
00:09:05,257 --> 00:09:07,634
- Who?
- The Lakeshore Strangler.

99
00:09:07,884 --> 00:09:09,636
He murdered a dozen people...

100
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,016
in this series of
ritual voodoo killings.

101
00:09:16,894 --> 00:09:18,646
Are we even qualified...

102
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:21,358
to take care of
a boy like this?

103
00:09:21,441 --> 00:09:24,195
I understand your concern,
Mr. Simpson,

104
00:09:24,278 --> 00:09:26,947
but this is just a child's way...

105
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:29,993
of coping with
a difficult situation.

106
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:31,369
Andy's fine now.

107
00:09:31,494 --> 00:09:35,207
He just wants
to get on with his life.

108
00:09:42,924 --> 00:09:45,885
So, Andy, what
do you like to eat?

109
00:09:45,969 --> 00:09:47,429
All kinds of things.

110
00:09:47,555 --> 00:09:51,142
What's your favorite food
in the whole wide world?

111
00:09:51,267 --> 00:09:53,895
Chocolate.

112
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:55,647
Besides chocolate.

113
00:09:55,939 --> 00:10:00,986
My mom used to fix me eggs
for breakfast. I like eggs.

114
00:10:01,112 --> 00:10:03,989
You got it.
Let's stop at the store.

115
00:10:04,114 --> 00:10:06,117
- The one down here?
- Yeah, the organic one.

116
00:10:06,242 --> 00:10:10,289
You're in luck, Andy.
Joanne's a terrific cook.

117
00:10:11,456 --> 00:10:14,168
You like sushi?
You know what--

118
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:16,587
- Phil, look out!
- Jesus Christ!

119
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:42,450
Look out for the car.

120
00:10:42,534 --> 00:10:44,452
Hey, wait up.

121
00:10:54,713 --> 00:10:56,675
Make yourself comfortable, Andy.

122
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,177
Thanks.

123
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:07,270
Well, I have to get back
to the office this afternoon.

124
00:11:07,353 --> 00:11:10,482
I thought that you'd
done everything.

125
00:11:10,565 --> 00:11:12,692
Oh, I have--

126
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,436
Uh-uh-uh.

127
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:46,439
First rule.
Don't touch the old stuff.

128
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:50,068
- Sorry.
- Well, that's okay. No foul.

129
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:55,116
It's just that, well, we collect this
junk, and a lot of it's fragile.

130
00:11:55,199 --> 00:11:57,618
- You like it?
- Uh-huh.

131
00:11:57,743 --> 00:12:00,205
It's been in my family
for three generations.

132
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,291
My grandmother gave it to my mother
and my mother gave it to me.

133
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:06,587
And who are you
gonna give it to?

134
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:10,592
Why don't you take this upstairs and
explore. I'll be up there in a minute.

135
00:12:10,717 --> 00:12:12,969
Okay.

136
00:12:19,018 --> 00:12:20,936
What do you think?

137
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:25,525
Oh, I'll get used to him.

138
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,424
Jesus. Did you
ever hear of knocking?

139
00:12:46,508 --> 00:12:48,634
Andy, did you find--

140
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,470
What, are you crazy?

141
00:12:50,596 --> 00:12:52,055
Give them to me.

142
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,473
Come on, Joanne.

143
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:56,477
Phil will shoot you
if he catches you again.

144
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:59,397
Andy, this is Kyle.
She's staying with us too.

145
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:02,483
- Charmed.
- Kyle, what is this?

146
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:06,280
You've been here three weeks.
Why haven't you unpacked?

147
00:13:06,321 --> 00:13:10,368
What for? I've never spent more
than a month in any home.

148
00:13:10,493 --> 00:13:12,954
With that attitude,
I can see why.

149
00:13:13,038 --> 00:13:16,666
Put these things away, then do me
a favor and help me get dinner started.

150
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,961
Can't. Got to work tonight.

151
00:13:19,086 --> 00:13:21,380
Kyle, that's the third night
in a row.

152
00:13:21,505 --> 00:13:24,967
I'd really like it if you'd spend
a little time with the family.

153
00:13:25,093 --> 00:13:28,555
I need the money.
I'm gonna be on my own next year.

154
00:13:28,638 --> 00:13:31,934
Yes, well, until then,
you're with us, ok?

155
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:36,314
- Come along, Andy.
- Bye.

156
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,651
I think you'll
be very happy here.

157
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,659
This is your room
right here.

158
00:13:54,293 --> 00:13:57,212
I made those curtains
just for you.

159
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,632
I bet blue is
your favorite color.

160
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:02,260
Take a look around.
I'll start to unpack.

161
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:08,601
Wow.

162
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:10,603
I thought
you might like those.

163
00:14:10,728 --> 00:14:13,064
Um, there's more
in the closet.

164
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:17,986
Before dinner,
we'll go explore the back yard.

165
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,155
Later I'll read
you some stories.

166
00:14:20,238 --> 00:14:22,408
Would you like that?

167
00:14:22,533 --> 00:14:25,035
There's lots of kids
in the neighborhood, Andy.

168
00:14:25,119 --> 00:14:28,206
I'm sure you're going
to make new friends.

169
00:14:28,248 --> 00:14:30,166
Aah!

170
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:36,716
Hey, hey, hey. Andy, rule number two,
no running in the house.

171
00:14:36,966 --> 00:14:39,260
It's only a doll.
Andy, are you listening to me?

172
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,220
It's only a doll.
Andy, are you listening to me?

173
00:14:40,262 --> 00:14:43,390
Oh, Andy, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that was in there.

174
00:14:43,473 --> 00:14:46,977
So many kids here, it's hard to keep
track of everything. I'll get rid of it.

175
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:50,231
Hi, I'm Tommy.
I'm your friend till the end.

176
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:54,695
Why don't we get settled in,
and then we'll have some dinner.

177
00:15:05,498 --> 00:15:07,459
Aw, shit.

178
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:23,435
Ohh--

179
00:15:55,013 --> 00:15:57,390
Hello, Gabriella.
Guess who?

180
00:15:59,727 --> 00:16:01,687
That's right.

181
00:16:01,728 --> 00:16:04,607
The vodka? Of course
I remembered the vodka.

182
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:08,153
Two-week anniversary.
You think I'd forget the vodka?

183
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,324
I know what that does to you.
Okay, well, wait for me.

184
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,994
On my way. Yeah.

185
00:16:15,119 --> 00:16:17,163
Shit.

186
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,040
I want to play Red Light.

187
00:16:56,165 --> 00:17:00,003
No, I don't want to play Red Light.
I want you to go back to bed.

188
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:02,131
But I'm scared.

189
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:05,384
There's nothing to be scared of.
It's just a storm.

190
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:10,056
Grace Poole.

191
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:13,477
Yes, I'm trying to
reach Andy Barclay.

192
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,023
Andy no longer lives here.
Who is this?

193
00:17:17,148 --> 00:17:19,692
This is his Uncle Charles.

194
00:17:21,611 --> 00:17:23,238
Sorry, uh, cash only.

195
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:27,117
But that's a gold card.
That's just as good as cash.

196
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:30,913
Not here, it ain't.
We don't accept credit cards.

197
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,249
I don't carry cash, okay?

198
00:17:33,332 --> 00:17:36,044
Aw.

199
00:17:48,642 --> 00:17:50,352
Oh--

200
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:21,137
- Don't move!
- Jesus!

201
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:25,350
God. Okay,
wh-wh-what do you want?

202
00:18:25,475 --> 00:18:28,478
- No questions. Just drive.
- Okay, okay.

203
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:37,030
Keep going.

204
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,551
Now park this piece of shit.

205
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,689
Put your arms
behind the seat.

206
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:10,026
- What?
- Do it!

207
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:13,696
Okay. Take it easy. Take it easy.
Please, don't shoot. Don't shoot.

208
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:17,576
Look, I don't carry cash.
I got-- I got a gold card.

209
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:20,955
I'll give you anything you want.
Tell me what you want.

210
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,541
Freeze, asshole.

211
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,294
Take my-- Take the car.

212
00:19:26,378 --> 00:19:29,131
You can drop me off,
but just, please, leave me alone.

213
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:31,592
- Please!
- Bang.

214
00:19:31,717 --> 00:19:34,178
You're dead.

215
00:19:43,606 --> 00:19:45,232
Aah!

216
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:00,667
No! No! No!

217
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:04,712
No! No! No! No!
No! No! No!

218
00:20:04,796 --> 00:20:06,340
Ha ha ha ha ha!

219
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:58,732
''The woodcutter argued
for a long time with his wife,

220
00:20:58,816 --> 00:21:01,402
''but she was such a horrid,
frightening woman when she was angry,

221
00:21:01,528 --> 00:21:04,656
''that in the end
he agreed to her plan.

222
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,117
''In the morning,
their stepmother called them.

223
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,539
''I think it would be nice if we
all went into the forest, she said.

224
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:15,585
''Hansel and Gretel did not reply, but
followed their parents into the forest.''

225
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,547
Where they all lived
happily ever after.''

226
00:21:18,672 --> 00:21:21,425
- No, they don't.
- Well, they do for now.

227
00:21:21,508 --> 00:21:24,137
We'll finish it tomorrow night.

228
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,014
- Don't go.
- What's the matter?

229
00:21:28,558 --> 00:21:32,021
- I miss my mother.
- Oh, honey, I know you do.

230
00:21:32,104 --> 00:21:36,066
- Will I ever see her again?
- Of course you will. I promise.

231
00:21:37,485 --> 00:21:41,323
Don't worry. I'll stay with you
as long as you want.

232
00:21:43,408 --> 00:21:47,246
My mother used to sing to me.
Will you sing to me?

233
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:54,337
~ Dee dee
dee dee dee dee ~

234
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,340
~ Hmm hmm hmm hmm ~

235
00:21:56,423 --> 00:21:59,761
~ Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm ~

236
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:03,014
~ Hmm hmm hmm hmm ~

237
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:06,309
~ Dee dee ~

238
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:09,563
~ Dee da da da ~

239
00:22:09,688 --> 00:22:13,025
~ Da da da da ~

240
00:22:13,109 --> 00:22:17,071
~ Dee da da da da ~~

241
00:22:20,492 --> 00:22:23,996
- Shit.
- Hi. I'm Tommy.

242
00:22:24,121 --> 00:22:26,123
Shut up, you idiot.

243
00:22:26,248 --> 00:22:27,584
I like to be hugged.

244
00:22:27,667 --> 00:22:30,795
I like to be hugged.
I like to be hugged.

245
00:22:31,045 --> 00:22:33,632
- I like to be hugged.
- Hug this.

246
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:36,302
I like to be hugged.
I like to be hugged. I like--

247
00:22:37,762 --> 00:22:41,516
- What was that?
- Nothing. Now go to sleep.

248
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,227
Nobody's going to hurt you.

249
00:23:08,338 --> 00:23:10,674
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

250
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,261
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

251
00:23:14,387 --> 00:23:16,680
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

252
00:23:16,805 --> 00:23:18,433
Ha ha.

253
00:23:18,516 --> 00:23:21,144
Eat dirt, Tommy.

254
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:23,564
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

255
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:25,691
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

256
00:23:28,361 --> 00:23:32,282
Do either of you have anything
to say about this?

257
00:23:32,365 --> 00:23:35,285
I think we should talk
to a lawyer first.

258
00:23:35,368 --> 00:23:38,789
Kyle, that's not funny.
That statue was very important to me.

259
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:43,044
I think one of you
owes Joanne an apology.

260
00:23:43,169 --> 00:23:44,670
I'm innocent.

261
00:23:45,797 --> 00:23:49,175
- Andy?
- I didn't do it.

262
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:54,557
All right.
You leave me no choice.

263
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,143
Till somebody fesses up,
you're both grounded.

264
00:23:58,227 --> 00:24:01,064
- But I have a date tonight.
- Sorry.

265
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:07,614
This is exactly how I wanted
to spend my day off. Thanks a lot.

266
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:10,241
But I didn't break
the statue. Really.

267
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,245
Yeah. Maybe it just fell, huh?

268
00:24:14,538 --> 00:24:17,667
Hey. You want to hear me
say your name backwards?

269
00:24:19,377 --> 00:24:21,546
Kyle.

270
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:23,673
Hold this.

271
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:33,268
Jesus. Give me that.

272
00:24:33,393 --> 00:24:36,730
- What the hell are you doing?
- I wanted to taste it.

273
00:24:36,855 --> 00:24:41,110
Get real. It tastes like shit, okay?
These things are very bad for you.

274
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:43,112
Then why do you do it?

275
00:24:43,195 --> 00:24:46,825
Because grownups are allowed to do
things that are bad for them.

276
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:49,411
You're not a grownup.

277
00:24:49,536 --> 00:24:52,122
You're beginning to get
on my nerves, Andy.

278
00:24:52,247 --> 00:24:54,751
Why don't you
give me a hand over here?

279
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:02,802
Mr. Simpson is kind of
grouchy, isn't he?

280
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,762
He's not so bad.

281
00:25:05,012 --> 00:25:08,099
I've had fosters that would shoot you
for staring at them cross-eyed.

282
00:25:08,183 --> 00:25:10,268
- Really?
- Sure.

283
00:25:10,351 --> 00:25:13,105
They figure you're not theirs.
You're just passing through.

284
00:25:13,146 --> 00:25:14,648
The minute you screw up--

285
00:25:14,731 --> 00:25:17,610
Grrr! They let you have it.

286
00:25:23,741 --> 00:25:27,663
I got to tell you, I'm not happy
with this whole thing.

287
00:25:27,746 --> 00:25:31,542
- Having second thoughts?
- Well, you have to admit it,

288
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:33,544
he's a very troubled
little boy...

289
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:37,424
that obviously has not come to terms
with this whole doll thing.

290
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:44,140
Look, all I'm saying
is that he may need more, uh,

291
00:25:44,224 --> 00:25:46,809
attention than we can give him.

292
00:25:47,101 --> 00:25:49,563
Phil, Andy's
been through hell.

293
00:25:49,688 --> 00:25:53,567
You have to give him some time.
He'll settle down.

294
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:56,445
Besides, I like him.

295
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:16,343
I hate you.

296
00:26:16,468 --> 00:26:20,222
Hi. I'm... Tommy
and I'm your friend to the end.

297
00:26:20,347 --> 00:26:22,183
Hi-de-ho.
Ha ha ha.

298
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:52,635
Hi.

299
00:26:53,886 --> 00:26:55,762
- Hi.
- Hi.

300
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:13,741
Kyle, do you miss
your mom and dad?

301
00:27:13,825 --> 00:27:17,037
Can't miss someone
you never knew.

302
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,997
Where are they?

303
00:27:19,122 --> 00:27:21,584
I have no idea.

304
00:27:21,709 --> 00:27:24,629
My dad left before I was born.

305
00:27:24,713 --> 00:27:28,550
My mom put me up
for adoption when I was 3.

306
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:30,594
Do you remember her?

307
00:27:32,304 --> 00:27:35,266
I made it a point to forget.

308
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:38,310
It's easier that way.

309
00:27:38,437 --> 00:27:41,273
Hey. Break time.

310
00:27:41,356 --> 00:27:43,776
Move over.

311
00:27:44,068 --> 00:27:46,820
- Want a push?
- No, thank you.

312
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,489
Come on. It's fun.

313
00:27:48,615 --> 00:27:51,075
Come on, Andy, please,
I just want to sit here, ok?

314
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,786
Too late. There you go.

315
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:56,248
Andy, come on.
Give me a break. Stop it.

316
00:27:56,331 --> 00:27:59,335
No. Ha ha ha!

317
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,421
Andy, I'll kill you.

318
00:28:03,214 --> 00:28:05,591
Come on. Let me off.

319
00:28:05,675 --> 00:28:08,053
Andy.

320
00:28:08,178 --> 00:28:10,055
I'll get you.

321
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,100
- Andy, cut it out.
- Dinner!

322
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:16,521
- Come and get it.
- Ahh!

323
00:28:16,646 --> 00:28:19,357
Mayhem. Come on.
I'll race you.

324
00:28:19,482 --> 00:28:22,069
No fair.
You got a head start.

325
00:28:22,194 --> 00:28:25,406
Excuses, excuses.
Don't forget your doll.

326
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:37,279
For Kyle.
Think she'll like it?

327
00:29:37,404 --> 00:29:39,699
What do I know
about teenage girls?

328
00:29:39,782 --> 00:29:42,285
- More than you did three weeks ago.
- I'm not so sure.

329
00:29:42,411 --> 00:29:45,372
We should get something for Andy.
Make him feel more settled.

330
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,750
- Any ideas?
- How about a Valium?

331
00:29:50,794 --> 00:29:52,672
Mm! Mm!

332
00:29:57,636 --> 00:29:59,429
Surprise.

333
00:29:59,513 --> 00:30:02,391
Did you miss me, Andy?
I sure missed you.

334
00:30:02,475 --> 00:30:05,270
I told you.

335
00:30:05,395 --> 00:30:07,856
We were going to be friends
to the end.

336
00:30:08,147 --> 00:30:11,276
And now it's time to play.

337
00:30:11,401 --> 00:30:14,155
I got a new game, sport.

338
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,617
It's called Hide the Soul.

339
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:22,539
And guess what? You're it.

340
00:30:24,667 --> 00:30:27,794
Ade Due Damballa.

341
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:31,465
Give me the power, I beg--

342
00:30:32,801 --> 00:30:34,845
This isn't over,
you little shit.

343
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:38,432
I'm not spending my life
as a plastic freak.

344
00:30:38,516 --> 00:30:41,226
Next time you're alone,
you're mine.

345
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:43,605
Mm! Mm! Mm!

346
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:45,648
Oh, my God.

347
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:52,615
- It's Chucky. Look out!
- Shut up. You'll wake Phil and Joanne.

348
00:30:52,698 --> 00:30:54,617
- Kill him!
- Stop it!

349
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:58,204
- What the hell is this, now?
- It's Chucky.

350
00:30:58,329 --> 00:31:01,166
I told you he'd find me.
He tried to take over my soul.

351
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:05,129
- Andy, calm down.
- You didn't have to wait up.

352
00:31:05,213 --> 00:31:07,507
Yeah? You know, Kyle,
I don't believe you.

353
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,178
You tied this child up
so he wouldn't tell on you.

354
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:13,639
- Oh, come on. Phil.
- Chucky did it.

355
00:31:13,723 --> 00:31:17,518
- That's enough now.
- Chucky? I've had it.

356
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:21,189
- But you got to kill him.
- Andy!

357
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:25,652
Please, listen to me.
I'm not lying.

358
00:31:25,736 --> 00:31:27,864
If you don't kill him,
he'll get me.

359
00:31:28,114 --> 00:31:29,573
Andy, calm down.

360
00:31:29,699 --> 00:31:32,160
I'm going to get rid of it.

361
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:40,127
There, see? He's gone.
He can't bother you anymore.

362
00:31:50,431 --> 00:31:52,766
No.

363
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,186
I'm turning human again?

364
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:59,608
If I don't get out
of this body soon, I'm screwed.

365
00:32:03,153 --> 00:32:05,322
Come on, Andy. We're late.

366
00:32:05,448 --> 00:32:08,325
Andy. Don't forget your lunch.

367
00:32:08,409 --> 00:32:11,371
Egg salad.

368
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,290
Mmm, yum.

369
00:32:23,385 --> 00:32:25,720
Whatever you do,
don't act nervous.

370
00:32:25,804 --> 00:32:28,307
They'll smell a new kid
a mile off.

371
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:30,267
Just act like you belong.

372
00:32:30,392 --> 00:32:32,729
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.

373
00:32:32,812 --> 00:32:35,731
Is it Chucky
coming to get you?

374
00:32:35,815 --> 00:32:41,197
Andy, how did you manage
to tie yourself up like that last night?

375
00:32:41,322 --> 00:32:43,616
- I already told you.
- Yeah.

376
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:47,620
You're just like everybody else.
You don't believe me either.

377
00:32:49,288 --> 00:32:51,291
- Kyle.
- Hi, Adam.

378
00:32:51,416 --> 00:32:55,296
Why'd you leave so early last night?
You missed all the fun.

379
00:32:55,421 --> 00:32:57,298
Story of my life.

380
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:58,117
Come on now.

381
00:33:58,242 --> 00:33:59,619
Where is it?

382
00:33:59,744 --> 00:34:02,788
Where-- Where-- Where is it?

383
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:06,626
Aha!

384
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:09,005
''Pinocchio jumped for joy, shouting,
I'm alive! I'm alive!

385
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,303
Then the talking cricket said--''
What'd he say?

386
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:19,308
''If you're very, very good,
and promise to tell no lies,

387
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:22,311
''then you will become
a real, live boy.

388
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:25,314
''Boys who are bent on following
their caprices...

389
00:34:25,398 --> 00:34:29,444
and will have their own way,
sooner or later repent.''

390
00:34:29,569 --> 00:34:32,614
- Get lost, microchip.
- Am I boring you, Andy?

391
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:34,825
No, Miss--

392
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:38,246
- Kettlewell.
- Kettlewell.

393
00:34:38,287 --> 00:34:41,541
I have precious little patience
for disruptive students.

394
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,543
But he just thwacked--

395
00:34:43,627 --> 00:34:46,130
Especially new students,
whose utmost concern...

396
00:34:46,213 --> 00:34:48,465
should be getting
on my good side.

397
00:34:49,884 --> 00:34:53,514
I want those desks spick-and-span
before anyone leaves.

398
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:17,249
- Andy! You think this is funny?
- I didn't do that.

399
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:19,834
Go ahead, kids.

400
00:35:20,126 --> 00:35:23,547
Don't forget the spelling test
tomorrow. Not you. Come over here.

401
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:26,843
Sit down and get comfy.
You're going to be here for a while.

402
00:35:27,135 --> 00:35:30,848
- But I didn't do it, I swear.
- No? Then who did?

403
00:35:32,474 --> 00:35:34,601
Don't even think about it.

404
00:35:34,684 --> 00:35:36,812
No toys.

405
00:35:36,937 --> 00:35:38,814
Head down!

406
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:54,207
Head down!

407
00:36:36,922 --> 00:36:38,715
Peekaboo!

408
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:42,553
Please, let me
out of here, Andy.

409
00:36:42,678 --> 00:36:44,681
It's dark in here.

410
00:36:44,806 --> 00:36:49,562
I promise I won't
kill anyone else. Okay?

411
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:52,314
Now open the goddamn door!

412
00:36:53,775 --> 00:36:56,235
Let me out, you little dick!

413
00:36:56,277 --> 00:36:58,655
Let me the fuck out!

414
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:19,428
Andy, I told you
to stay in your seat.

415
00:37:19,553 --> 00:37:22,057
Come out of there!

416
00:37:22,182 --> 00:37:24,100
Open this door right now.

417
00:37:30,358 --> 00:37:32,527
Andy, come out
this very second.

418
00:37:32,652 --> 00:37:34,571
Andy! Andy!

419
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,408
Andy?

420
00:37:54,802 --> 00:37:56,847
Andy?

421
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:07,233
Andy, this isn't funny.

422
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,787
Ohh!

423
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:28,841
Ohh!

424
00:38:28,925 --> 00:38:31,177
Aah!

425
00:38:36,891 --> 00:38:43,441
You've been very naughty,
Miss Kettlewell.

426
00:38:53,786 --> 00:38:55,788
Aah! Aah!

427
00:38:57,373 --> 00:39:00,209
Aah!

428
00:39:00,293 --> 00:39:03,297
Aah!

429
00:39:09,595 --> 00:39:11,389
Andy, what's this all about?

430
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:13,224
Chucky followed me to school.

431
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:16,812
He tried to get me again,
so I ran home.

432
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:20,400
- Do you know what's he talking about?
- His teacher called,

433
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,402
said she was keeping him
after school for detention,

434
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,406
said he wrote an obscenity
on his paper.

435
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:28,576
Chucky did it.

436
00:39:30,202 --> 00:39:32,121
All right, Andy. Come on.

437
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:36,376
This is going to stop, 'cause I will not
allow this foolishness in my house.

438
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,503
- Do you understand? Open the door.
- Oh, Phil--

439
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:40,589
Joanne, please.

440
00:39:43,551 --> 00:39:45,803
Open the door.

441
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:50,433
Open it.

442
00:39:52,853 --> 00:39:54,396
Open it!

443
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:04,449
Now, I want you to look down there
and tell me what you see.

444
00:40:06,577 --> 00:40:08,537
It's Chucky, but--

445
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:10,915
His name... is Tommy,

446
00:40:11,165 --> 00:40:14,545
and he's been there
since last night, hasn't he?

447
00:40:16,505 --> 00:40:18,381
Hasn't he?

448
00:40:23,513 --> 00:40:27,308
For crying out loud, Joanne,
the child needs professional help!

449
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:30,729
Stop pretending you're worried about
Andy. You never wanted him here.

450
00:40:30,854 --> 00:40:34,233
- That's not true.
- So what are you suggesting we do?

451
00:40:34,358 --> 00:40:36,986
- Send him back?
- Don't have to make it sound horrible.

452
00:40:37,237 --> 00:40:39,989
Do you have any idea
how traumatic that would be?

453
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,328
For whom, Joanne,
for him or for you?

454
00:40:44,453 --> 00:40:47,582
Look, if that kid stays here,
he's gonna tear this family apart!

455
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:50,001
Family? Is this
what you call a family?

456
00:40:50,251 --> 00:40:52,587
Families don't just
give up on their children.

457
00:40:52,712 --> 00:40:56,717
Joanne, he's not our child.

458
00:41:03,391 --> 00:41:05,644
It's not the end of the world.

459
00:41:05,727 --> 00:41:09,565
But they're going
to send me away.

460
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,159
You'll be okay.

461
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:21,578
Where will I go?

462
00:41:21,662 --> 00:41:23,581
Andy...

463
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:28,170
I've lived with dozens
of different familes,

464
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:31,172
and they always
seem to send me away...

465
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:34,593
just when I'm getting comfortable,
but you know what?

466
00:41:34,718 --> 00:41:37,180
- What?
- Every time it happens...

467
00:41:37,263 --> 00:41:40,600
it just makes me stronger,
because it reminds me...

468
00:41:40,725 --> 00:41:44,604
that the only one
I can count on is myself.

469
00:41:44,729 --> 00:41:48,192
Okay, and you have
to learn that now.

470
00:41:48,317 --> 00:41:50,737
I know it sounds tough,

471
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,989
but you'll deal with it.

472
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:56,660
It doesn't matter.

473
00:41:56,743 --> 00:41:59,831
Wherever I go,
Chucky will find me.

474
00:45:09,546 --> 00:45:11,965
Uhh!

475
00:45:53,721 --> 00:45:56,223
Yaah!

476
00:46:05,984 --> 00:46:09,488
...advances over the declines
by a 7-to-6 margin.

477
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:12,492
- More on today--
- What's wrong?

478
00:46:13,785 --> 00:46:16,247
I thought
I heard something downstairs.

479
00:46:16,372 --> 00:46:19,917
- It's one of the children.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

480
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:27,843
Why fight it, Andy?
We're going to be very close.

481
00:46:27,968 --> 00:46:31,722
In fact, we're going to be
fucking inseparable.

482
00:46:37,562 --> 00:46:38,981
Aah!

483
00:46:42,609 --> 00:46:45,446
What the hell's
going on down--

484
00:46:46,656 --> 00:46:48,783
Andy...

485
00:46:48,909 --> 00:46:50,243
put down the knife.

486
00:46:50,327 --> 00:46:51,786
But I need it for--

487
00:46:53,247 --> 00:46:56,667
Just put the knife down,
and we'll talk about it.

488
00:47:06,637 --> 00:47:08,806
Everything is going
to be just fine.

489
00:47:17,858 --> 00:47:19,776
Aah!

490
00:47:26,451 --> 00:47:28,578
How's it hanging, Phil?

491
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:32,457
Aah!

492
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:35,795
Aah!

493
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:41,509
No. Oh, God, Phil.

494
00:47:43,846 --> 00:47:45,681
I'll call an ambulance.

495
00:47:45,806 --> 00:47:47,892
Phil. Phil.

496
00:47:49,352 --> 00:47:51,604
Oh, God! No!

497
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:53,482
Oh, God! Ohh!

498
00:47:55,025 --> 00:47:57,528
Get away from me!

499
00:48:00,030 --> 00:48:02,283
Oh, God!

500
00:48:39,576 --> 00:48:41,869
I should have
listened to him.

501
00:48:41,953 --> 00:48:45,666
He'd be here now
if only I'd listened to him.

502
00:48:49,754 --> 00:48:51,714
It's not your fault.

503
00:48:58,263 --> 00:49:00,265
I'll take care of this.

504
00:49:10,444 --> 00:49:13,864
Andy, you'll be fine now.

505
00:49:13,948 --> 00:49:16,868
Come stay at the center
for a few days...

506
00:49:16,951 --> 00:49:20,247
until we can find you
a new family.

507
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:23,458
We've placed Kyle
with a number of familes.

508
00:49:23,583 --> 00:49:26,253
Things always seem to work out okay.

509
00:49:26,337 --> 00:49:28,214
Don't they?

510
00:49:28,297 --> 00:49:30,258
Yeah.

511
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,847
There's your stuff.

512
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:40,436
Come on, Andy. Let's go.

513
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,273
He's still in the cellar, Kyle.

514
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:46,735
- Don't let him get you too.
- Andy.

515
00:50:00,668 --> 00:50:03,379
We'll be out of your way
in just a minute here.

516
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:07,634
Did anyone besides the boy
witness the accident?

517
00:50:07,759 --> 00:50:09,720
- No.
- Okay.

518
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:11,805
Let's go.

519
00:52:24,664 --> 00:52:26,541
Joanne!

520
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,669
Joanne!

521
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,257
Joanne?

522
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,858
Joanne!

523
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:43,738
Rrah!

524
00:55:05,764 --> 00:55:07,766
Ugh!

525
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:49,313
Bitch. You hurt me.

526
00:55:54,778 --> 00:55:57,697
How much further
till we get to the kid?

527
00:55:57,781 --> 00:56:00,284
- A ways.
- Step on it.

528
00:56:00,367 --> 00:56:02,286
What's the rush?

529
00:56:02,369 --> 00:56:06,624
If I don't get out of this body soon,
I'll be trapped in here!

530
00:56:06,749 --> 00:56:08,919
What are you looking at?

531
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:23,018
- Floor it.
- Get real. This is a station wagon.

532
00:56:23,310 --> 00:56:25,563
Shit!

533
00:56:25,688 --> 00:56:27,565
Pull over.

534
00:56:38,744 --> 00:56:40,663
Behave yourself.

535
00:56:40,747 --> 00:56:42,999
I'll kill you if I have to.

536
00:56:45,752 --> 00:56:48,088
Okay, honey,
let's see your license.

537
00:56:52,886 --> 00:56:56,889
You were clocking 60 in a 45.
What's your hurry?

538
00:56:57,015 --> 00:56:58,934
I have a date.

539
00:56:59,017 --> 00:57:01,937
You're going to have to do
better than that.

540
00:57:02,021 --> 00:57:04,774
That's one of those Good Guys,
isn't it?

541
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,946
- Yes, it is.
- I love these things. What's your name?

542
00:57:12,074 --> 00:57:15,787
- Chucky.
- That's incredible.

543
00:57:16,829 --> 00:57:19,916
- I'll say.
- What the hell's that?

544
00:57:27,007 --> 00:57:29,051
You've seen dolls that pee?

545
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:31,054
This one bleeds.

546
00:57:35,893 --> 00:57:37,394
Okay, look, uh...

547
00:57:37,477 --> 00:57:39,814
just slow it down, huh?

548
00:57:39,897 --> 00:57:42,650
And, uh, buckle up for safety.

549
00:57:48,532 --> 00:57:50,659
Now, get going.

550
00:57:59,794 --> 00:58:02,631
- You okay, honey?
- Mm-hmm.

551
00:58:02,715 --> 00:58:05,009
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

552
00:58:25,074 --> 00:58:26,867
Come on. Step on it.

553
00:58:28,577 --> 00:58:31,372
Fine. We'll just get
pulled over again.

554
00:58:31,414 --> 00:58:33,834
Just shut up and drive...

555
00:58:33,917 --> 00:58:36,961
before I kick
your fucking teeth in.

556
00:58:44,887 --> 00:58:46,806
Rrah!

557
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,644
You goddamn women drivers!

558
00:59:01,782 --> 00:59:04,284
Fuck.

559
00:59:04,409 --> 00:59:06,412
Fucking bastard.

560
00:59:23,097 --> 00:59:24,766
Shit. Andy.

561
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:53,757
Playtime's over.

562
01:00:37,056 --> 01:00:38,975
Andy, what are you doing?

563
01:00:39,059 --> 01:00:41,603
We've got to get
out of the building.

564
01:00:42,855 --> 01:00:45,315
Kyle, what's going on here?

565
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:50,488
You did this, didn't you?

566
01:00:52,741 --> 01:00:54,618
He did it.

567
01:00:56,495 --> 01:00:59,081
Get into my office.

568
01:01:01,751 --> 01:01:04,379
Is this your idea of a joke?

569
01:01:08,717 --> 01:01:10,469
Give me that.

570
01:01:10,595 --> 01:01:11,679
Amazing, isn't it?

571
01:01:12,972 --> 01:01:15,475
Aah! Aah!

572
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,727
Aah! Aah!

573
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:27,488
Come on!

574
01:01:27,613 --> 01:01:32,703
Okay, sport, we're going to have
a little game of Chucky Says.

575
01:01:32,787 --> 01:01:34,997
Chucky says,
move your ass.

576
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:39,711
Snap out of it!

577
01:01:39,794 --> 01:01:42,548
You act like you've never seen
a dead body before.

578
01:01:50,097 --> 01:01:52,434
Andy, come on! Open it!

579
01:01:52,517 --> 01:01:55,604
Andy! Open the door!

580
01:01:55,729 --> 01:01:58,357
Come on! Everybody out!

581
01:02:16,836 --> 01:02:18,589
Inside. Hurry.

582
01:02:42,741 --> 01:02:44,868
Stop!

583
01:02:52,126 --> 01:02:53,878
Come on.

584
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,465
Come on.

585
01:02:56,548 --> 01:02:58,508
Come on.

586
01:03:09,688 --> 01:03:12,024
Hey, lady,
slow down, will you?

587
01:03:19,866 --> 01:03:22,536
~ Passin' by ~~

588
01:03:53,821 --> 01:03:55,907
Say your prayers, Andy.

589
01:03:58,117 --> 01:04:01,663
Goddamn it!

590
01:04:19,892 --> 01:04:22,479
Pull over!

591
01:04:22,604 --> 01:04:25,690
- What?
- Pull over!

592
01:04:25,774 --> 01:04:27,860
Pull over!

593
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:43,127
What in the hell
do you think you're doing?

594
01:04:43,377 --> 01:04:45,422
Let me go. Let me go.

595
01:04:45,547 --> 01:04:47,716
What the fuck's
wrong with you?

596
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,679
Let go!

597
01:04:51,804 --> 01:04:53,722
Crazy bitch!

598
01:05:51,538 --> 01:05:52,914
We're home.

599
01:05:57,211 --> 01:05:59,673
Close your eyes
and count to seven.

600
01:05:59,756 --> 01:06:01,883
When you wake,
you'll be in heaven.

601
01:06:03,385 --> 01:06:07,348
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

602
01:06:07,432 --> 01:06:08,891
This is it, world.

603
01:06:09,016 --> 01:06:10,893
From now on,

604
01:06:11,018 --> 01:06:13,813
no more Mr. Good Guy.

605
01:06:15,899 --> 01:06:20,779
Ade Due Damballa.

606
01:06:20,905 --> 01:06:24,033
Give me the power,
I beg of you.

607
01:06:36,589 --> 01:06:41,053
Leveau mercier
du bois chaloitte.

608
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:46,767
Secoise entienne mais
pois de morte.

609
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:52,983
Morteisma lieu de vocuier

610
01:06:53,108 --> 01:06:58,156
Edenlieu pour

611
01:06:58,406 --> 01:07:03,537
Edenlieu pour

612
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:08,542
Edenlieu pour

613
01:07:34,739 --> 01:07:38,492
Aah!

614
01:07:44,834 --> 01:07:46,752
You little shit!

615
01:07:46,835 --> 01:07:48,755
Do you know what you've done?

616
01:07:48,838 --> 01:07:50,423
It's too late!

617
01:07:50,506 --> 01:07:53,594
I've spent too much time
in this body!

618
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:56,012
I'm fucking trapped in here!

619
01:07:56,096 --> 01:07:59,100
What the hell?

620
01:08:00,601 --> 01:08:02,812
Andy, run.

621
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:09,862
Aah!

622
01:08:13,115 --> 01:08:15,034
- Andy.
- Kyle.

623
01:08:15,117 --> 01:08:17,871
Are you okay? Come on.

624
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:40,772
Shit!

625
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:48,739
Andy, hurry up.

626
01:09:11,057 --> 01:09:14,518
Let's go. I'll go first.

627
01:09:14,518 --> 01:09:16,688
Stay right behind me.

628
01:09:28,617 --> 01:09:30,495
Come on.

629
01:09:38,755 --> 01:09:41,090
Andy, step on it.

630
01:09:41,174 --> 01:09:43,969
Reach! Give me your hand!

631
01:09:45,804 --> 01:09:48,849
Andy! Stop yourself.
Grab the side.

632
01:09:50,643 --> 01:09:52,979
- Aah!
- Andy!

633
01:09:53,104 --> 01:09:56,065
- Hurry up! He's right behind you.
- You bastard!

634
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:11,792
Don't look back.
Come on. Hurry!

635
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:14,962
- You can't get away from me!
- Give me your hand!

636
01:10:15,046 --> 01:10:16,923
Reach!

637
01:10:18,716 --> 01:10:21,636
I'm going to kill you, Andy!

638
01:10:24,473 --> 01:10:27,851
Aah!

639
01:10:27,976 --> 01:10:29,646
Aah!

640
01:10:29,729 --> 01:10:32,190
Come on. Go! Go! Go!

641
01:10:32,482 --> 01:10:34,192
Run down there.

642
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:39,115
I'm going to get you fuckers!

643
01:10:43,453 --> 01:10:45,079
Aah.

644
01:10:45,205 --> 01:10:48,625
G-- Oh, God!

645
01:10:48,709 --> 01:10:51,921
Aah!

646
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:54,799
Oh, God!

647
01:10:54,882 --> 01:10:56,885
Aah!

648
01:10:59,179 --> 01:11:00,848
Ohh--

649
01:11:00,931 --> 01:11:02,850
Aah!

650
01:11:04,726 --> 01:11:06,688
Ohh--

651
01:11:36,513 --> 01:11:38,891
Come on. Do it!

652
01:11:45,606 --> 01:11:48,944
Come on. Give me your hand.

653
01:11:49,027 --> 01:11:51,072
Don't be afraid. Come on.

654
01:11:53,032 --> 01:11:56,244
Closer. Closer so you can
grab my hand.

655
01:11:56,494 --> 01:11:59,163
Andy. Now!

656
01:12:05,630 --> 01:12:10,468
Aah!

657
01:12:10,552 --> 01:12:13,889
- Can't open it.
- How will we get out?

658
01:12:13,973 --> 01:12:17,184
We'll have to find another way.
Give me your hand.

659
01:12:17,476 --> 01:12:19,687
I hate kids.

660
01:12:34,120 --> 01:12:36,038
Terrific.

661
01:14:21,993 --> 01:14:23,744
Aah!

662
01:14:34,923 --> 01:14:36,217
Ugh!

663
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:15,470
- Hee hee hee hee!
- Duck!

664
01:15:17,681 --> 01:15:19,516
Aah!

665
01:15:19,641 --> 01:15:23,854
Aah! Aah!

666
01:15:23,938 --> 01:15:27,734
Aah! Aah! Aah!

667
01:15:27,859 --> 01:15:30,779
Do it!

668
01:15:34,574 --> 01:15:36,702
Andy, please.

669
01:15:36,827 --> 01:15:39,413
I was only playing.

670
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:42,792
Aah!

671
01:15:42,876 --> 01:15:45,004
No, please!

672
01:15:45,129 --> 01:15:47,172
No, please!

673
01:15:55,223 --> 01:15:56,558
Aah!

674
01:15:56,641 --> 01:16:00,813
No! No! God!
No! No! No!

675
01:16:00,896 --> 01:16:04,651
Aah!

676
01:16:28,010 --> 01:16:30,931
Holy shit.

677
01:16:31,056 --> 01:16:32,974
We did it.

678
01:16:36,896 --> 01:16:38,772
Let's get out of here.

679
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,965
- Let's see. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

680
01:17:02,049 --> 01:17:03,593
- What's this?
- Thanks for coming after me.

681
01:17:04,552 --> 01:17:07,764
Yeah, well,
you owe me one, squirt.

682
01:17:07,848 --> 01:17:09,933
Kyle!

683
01:17:10,016 --> 01:17:11,810
Aah!

684
01:17:20,486 --> 01:17:24,407
I've got you now, Andy,

685
01:17:24,491 --> 01:17:27,828
and you know what
I'm going to do to you?

686
01:17:27,912 --> 01:17:32,041
I'm going to cut
off your legs too.

687
01:17:45,181 --> 01:17:46,850
Huh?

688
01:17:53,149 --> 01:17:55,151
No!

689
01:17:56,652 --> 01:17:57,946
Aah!

690
01:17:59,281 --> 01:18:02,701
Aah! Aah!

691
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:16,926
Kyle! Kyle!

692
01:18:17,051 --> 01:18:20,012
Kyle! Kyle! Kyle, wake up!

693
01:18:21,681 --> 01:18:23,892
Kyle!

694
01:18:23,975 --> 01:18:26,395
Come on. Come on.

695
01:18:46,918 --> 01:18:50,088
Ugh! God.
What did you do to him?

696
01:18:55,261 --> 01:18:57,514
All right, Andy.

697
01:19:00,475 --> 01:19:01,977
Aah!

698
01:19:02,102 --> 01:19:03,896
Aah!

699
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:07,775
Kyle! Kyle!

700
01:19:07,900 --> 01:19:10,779
Aah! Aah!

701
01:19:14,657 --> 01:19:17,745
Eat this, you son of a bitch!

702
01:19:24,586 --> 01:19:26,963
Come on.

703
01:20:13,266 --> 01:20:16,770
- Where are we going?
- Home.

704
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,772
Where's home?
