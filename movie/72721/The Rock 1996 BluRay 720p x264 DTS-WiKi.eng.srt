1
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:47,512
We can't hold out much longer, sir!

2
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:18,169
General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!

3
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,907
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

4
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:31,087
Goddamn it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost 15 men already!

5
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:34,855
Sir, they're lightin' us up
like a firestorm!

6
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,226
This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

7
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:39,857
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

8
00:01:43,737 --> 00:01:45,705
They're not coming for us,
are they, sir?

9
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:57,707
Congressman Weaver
and esteemed members...

10
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,581
of the Special Armed Services
Committee.

11
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:04,051
I come before you to protest
a grave injustice.

12
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,092
Aim!

13
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,464
It has to stop.

14
00:03:02,749 --> 00:03:06,053
I miss you so much.

15
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,992
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

16
00:03:18,065 --> 00:03:20,932
Something I couldn't do
while you were here.

17
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:25,904
I tried.
You know I tried everything.

18
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:30,272
And I still don't have
their attention.

19
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:34,211
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

20
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:36,715
But whatever happens...

21
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:41,345
please don't think less of me.

22
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,962
Marine, inform the garrison C. O...

23
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:28,899
that General Hummel's coming on
board with a security inspection team.

24
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:32,735
Yes, sir.
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

25
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:05,562
Ya know, at least
we can get some...

26
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:08,699
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

27
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:28,055
I got the access card. We've got
30 minutes 'til those darts wear off.

28
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,255
Move it!

29
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,964
The access card, sir.

30
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:40,604
Let's do it.

31
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:46,745
2400 magazine check.

32
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:04,957
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

33
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:17,301
Clear!

34
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:47,535
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

35
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,397
Evac! Seal the door!

36
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,663
- No!
- Come on, man!
- No!
- Seal it!

37
00:07:17,737 --> 00:07:20,570
- No!
- Seal it!
- Help!

38
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:26,206
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

39
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,406
Let me out! Let me out!

40
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:32,577
Clear out.
Get outta here!

41
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,257
Sorry.

42
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,932
Let's move out.

43
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,748
Two more cc's
of acetylene chloride.

44
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:11,954
- That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.
- You suck.

45
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:21,495
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

46
00:08:21,568 --> 00:08:25,561
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

47
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,937
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

48
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,138
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

49
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:37,547
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $13 on a CD, man?

50
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,812
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

51
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,320
And second,
these sound better.

52
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:47,487
Could be serious.
Could be sarin gas.

53
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,695
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

54
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:54,699
postmarked to
a Bosnian refugee camp.

55
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,634
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

56
00:08:57,704 --> 00:08:59,604
Bosnian refugee camp?

57
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:03,039
Half a million Serbians
reside in the U.S., Marvin.
Serbians don't like Bosnians.

58
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,339
You guys wanna get suited up?

59
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,112
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

60
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,312
We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

61
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:23,018
October 1, 0900 hours.

62
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,827
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood...

63
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,163
initiating exam
of wooden crate.

64
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:32,693
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

65
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:35,332
- Marvin, sarin is a...
- G.B. Aerosol.

66
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,069
That is correct.

67
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:39,407
Now, let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

68
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:41,470
Stone Age Cave Girls
in the Raw.

69
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:45,677
Kinky. And, uh...
Not a good sign.

70
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:48,913
Hello, little baby doll.

71
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:51,047
Lookit, Stan.

72
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:53,251
- Hi there, Stanley.
- Marvin!
- Marvin, don't!

73
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:57,660
- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!

74
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,459
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

75
00:10:01,534 --> 00:10:03,934
We'll have that room clear
in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

76
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:06,335
Jesus Christ!

77
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:11,107
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

78
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:14,613
The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.

79
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:17,844
- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news...

80
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:21,614
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

81
00:10:21,688 --> 00:10:24,782
- and kill everybody
in the building.
- Detonation too heavy.
- Everybody, out of the room now!

82
00:10:24,857 --> 00:10:27,291
Seal us inside.

83
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:34,258
- Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
- The acid's eating my su...

84
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:37,792
It's eating my fucking suit!
All right? Shit!

85
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:41,306
- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?

86
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,239
We're working on it.
It's coming. It's just a flow problem.

87
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,937
Well, that's a pretty big
friggin' problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

88
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:49,413
- We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?
- A minute ten.

89
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:51,712
- Look at this!
- We're gonna have the room clear.

90
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:54,844
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, Isherwood.

91
00:10:54,921 --> 00:10:57,651
- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!

92
00:10:57,724 --> 00:11:02,093
- Marvin, the atropine, now!
- Inject it in your heart
before your suit melts.

93
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,652
Shit!

94
00:11:04,731 --> 00:11:06,596
Make him take his dose.

95
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,067
- Where's that water?
- Get that away from me!

96
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:13,663
Come on, Phil, fix it
for Christ's sake!

97
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,141
- Take the atropine now, Stan,
for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

98
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,201
The poison's mixing.

99
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:23,146
What the fuck are you
waiting for, Stanley?
You take the fucking needle now!

100
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:25,844
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

101
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:29,376
If that suit melts...
If you die, we all die!

102
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:32,015
Inject your heart
and then diffuse the bomb!

103
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:35,288
- Come on, just do it, Stan!
- Shit! What if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

104
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:40,321
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is. You want
me to stick this into my heart?

105
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,927
- Are you fucking nuts?
- The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

106
00:11:44,003 --> 00:11:46,130
Okay, here we go, man!

107
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:50,832
Sprinkler activated.

108
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,878
How much time left?

109
00:11:52,945 --> 00:11:55,277
Twenty seconds!

110
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:58,345
We're not gonna make it.

111
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,649
Fifteen.

112
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:06,391
Oh, come on.

113
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:08,791
Clear!

114
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,331
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

115
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,891
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.

116
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:19,460
Please lock me away

117
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,064
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

118
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,631
Hi, baby.

119
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:29,011
Here inside where I hide
with my loneliness

120
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,641
I had such
an interesting day today.

121
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:34,185
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

122
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:37,353
Oh, okay, you go first.

123
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,917
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies...

124
00:12:41,994 --> 00:12:46,124
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

125
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,962
So I took the rest of the day off.

126
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:50,901
Glass of wine, little guitar.
Just relaxing.

127
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,499
- Wow!
- I mean it, honey. The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

128
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:59,670
I really believe that anyone
who's even thinking about
having a child in this world...

129
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:03,272
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

130
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:06,250
I know, I'm rambling,
I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

131
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:09,686
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

132
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:13,021
I'm sorry?

133
00:13:13,092 --> 00:13:16,027
I'm pregnant.

134
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,732
- Really?
- Yeah.

135
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,792
- Wow!
- Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

136
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:26,395
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

137
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,736
How do you know? I mean,
h-how do you know?

138
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:35,473
Blue! Just turned blue
so I went to the doctor.

139
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,608
- Well, you didn't mean what
you just said, did you?
- When?

140
00:13:38,684 --> 00:13:40,777
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

141
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:43,788
and having it be
an act of cruelty.

142
00:13:43,856 --> 00:13:47,883
- I meant it at the time.
- Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

143
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,326
Well, gosh!

144
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:53,763
Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

145
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:58,930
- I know. It's funny
you should mention that.
- It's funny?

146
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,099
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

147
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,301
Good.

148
00:14:06,879 --> 00:14:11,907
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa! Whoa! Wai... Hey,
Marriage Police, pull over!

149
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:14,953
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

150
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:28,634
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

151
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,192
Is it really true that
there's never been an escape?

152
00:14:31,271 --> 00:14:35,503
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until
'63 when the prison closed...

153
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:37,406
there were 14 attempts.

154
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:43,177
No one is believed to have made
it to shore, alive at least.

155
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,412
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

156
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:48,977
- I don't really give a shit!
Do you give a shit?
- No.

157
00:14:49,055 --> 00:14:51,523
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

158
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:55,493
- Hey, girls? Hi.
You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

159
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:58,429
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

160
00:14:58,498 --> 00:15:02,628
I need you to tell your teacher
that you need to get back on
the boat and go home right now.

161
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:05,899
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

162
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,997
This cell block housed...

163
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,669
the most awesome scum in America.

164
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,372
Ladies and gentlemen,
I, Ranger Bob...

165
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:19,180
cordially invite you to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

166
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,253
On the line!

167
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,860
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

168
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,294
Like being a caged animal.

169
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:33,992
Spend a couple of years in there...

170
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,332
- What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?
- The tour's over, Bob.

171
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,875
What kind of fucked-up tour
is this?

172
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:03,585
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

173
00:16:03,663 --> 00:16:07,463
Welcome to The Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the
back side and deploy as planned.

174
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:09,934
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

175
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,994
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun.

176
00:16:12,071 --> 00:16:14,835
Oh, you're not allowed to carry
a gun? I got a goddamned gun.

177
00:16:14,908 --> 00:16:18,708
If I'd have known this was
gonna happen, I'd have brought
my motherfuckin' gun! Help!

178
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,239
All right, gentlemen, this'll be
our new home. Tom, I want
my command center right here.

179
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,493
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

180
00:16:35,562 --> 00:16:39,965
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

181
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:43,025
Let's move it.

182
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,639
- Systems up.
- Possible penetration point
in the shower room.

183
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:59,116
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch, sir.

184
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:03,246
It's an anti-motion trembler device.
It's custom-made.

185
00:17:03,323 --> 00:17:05,951
Nobody knows about it
and nobody expects it.

186
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,392
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

187
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:13,489
And then if they disturb
Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

188
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:30,778
Ladies and gentlemen, you're being
detained against your will.

189
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,182
For that, I apologize.

190
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:35,346
It is not our intention
in any way to harm you.

191
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:38,822
You will not be detained one
minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

192
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,689
Attention on deck!

193
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:51,498
Stand easy, men.

194
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:56,372
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen,
we are now in harm's way.

195
00:17:56,442 --> 00:18:01,072
For Major Baxter and I,
this is the last campaign
in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

196
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:05,073
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

197
00:18:05,151 --> 00:18:08,951
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

198
00:18:09,022 --> 00:18:12,617
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow,
this is my first operational
situation with you and your men.

199
00:18:12,692 --> 00:18:15,490
And I have to say, thus far
your conduct reflects your reputations.

200
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,529
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

201
00:18:17,597 --> 00:18:21,089
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

202
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,260
To this we must now add resolve.

203
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:26,828
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

204
00:18:26,906 --> 00:18:29,067
Punishable by death.

205
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:32,406
A couple hundred years ago...

206
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:35,038
a few guys named Washington,
Jefferson and Adams...

207
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,447
were branded as traitors
by the British.

208
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:41,351
And now they're called patriots.

209
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,446
In time, so shall we.

210
00:18:45,258 --> 00:18:47,283
God willing,
in less than 48 hours...

211
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,957
you will evacuate this island
in gunships under cover of
hostages and V.X. Gas warheads.

212
00:18:53,032 --> 00:18:56,524
Your destination:
A non-extradition treaty country.

213
00:18:56,602 --> 00:19:01,198
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

214
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:06,075
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

215
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,046
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

216
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,878
The men of
Marine Force Recon...

217
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,579
are selected to carry out
illegal operations throughout the world.

218
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,081
When they don't come home...

219
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:22,924
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

220
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,225
and denied compensation.

221
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,734
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career!

222
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:31,326
Well, here and now the lies stop!

223
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,860
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

224
00:19:44,901 --> 00:19:47,165
This is FBI Director Womack.

225
00:19:47,237 --> 00:19:50,798
Director, be advised.

226
00:19:50,874 --> 00:19:53,638
Eighty-one, I say again,

227
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:56,095
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

228
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:57,653
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

229
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:01,995
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

230
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,500
Who is this?

231
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,333
Mr. Director, you have
a very serious problem.

232
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:09,169
A battery of V.X. Gas rockets
is presently deployed...

233
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:13,541
to deliver a highly
lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

234
00:20:13,612 --> 00:20:18,015
- I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.
- I want to know who I'm talking to.

235
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:22,247
This is Brigadier General
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

236
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,482
Out!

237
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,822
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

238
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:33,833
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

239
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:37,727
Last night General Hummel,
using brutal but nonlethal force...

240
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:43,104
under the guise of a security
exercise, walked off with 15
V.X. Poison gas rockets.

241
00:20:43,174 --> 00:20:45,276
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

242
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:49,038
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

243
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:53,345
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

244
00:20:53,417 --> 00:20:56,318
Three Purple Hearts,
two Silver Stars...

245
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:58,150
and the Congressional Medal of...

246
00:20:58,222 --> 00:21:01,419
Jesus! This man is a hero!

247
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:04,052
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

248
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:07,564
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

249
00:21:07,631 --> 00:21:10,099
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel
is a man of honor.

250
00:21:11,635 --> 00:21:13,398
General, it's him.

251
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,506
Frank, it's Al Kramer.

252
00:21:17,574 --> 00:21:19,439
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

253
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,876
I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.

254
00:21:21,945 --> 00:21:24,778
Got a lot of very, very
worried people here, Frank.

255
00:21:24,848 --> 00:21:26,782
I'll come straight to the point.

256
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:30,342
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

257
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:32,787
Forty-seven in northern Laos
and southern China.

258
00:21:32,856 --> 00:21:36,087
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

259
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,424
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

260
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:42,454
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

261
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:46,264
- How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I'm 33.

262
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:50,569
Well, Mr. Sinclair, you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

263
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:53,007
By your ninth birthday, I was
runnin' black ops into China...

264
00:21:53,077 --> 00:21:56,103
and my men were responsible
f-for over 200 enemy kills.

265
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:01,083
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr.
Sinclair's mouth. He's wasting my time.

266
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:02,641
Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

267
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,915
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

268
00:22:04,988 --> 00:22:08,788
Those surgical hits made by
our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

269
00:22:08,859 --> 00:22:13,523
It was my men on the ground
that made those hits possible
by lasing the targets.

270
00:22:13,597 --> 00:22:17,089
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

271
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:19,727
No benefits were paid
to their families.

272
00:22:19,803 --> 00:22:23,239
No medals conferred.

273
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:27,710
These men died for their country,
and they weren't even given
a goddamn military burial.

274
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,876
The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $100 million...

275
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:37,819
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea
Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

276
00:22:37,888 --> 00:22:40,652
From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid...

277
00:22:40,724 --> 00:22:43,284
to each of
the 83 marines' families.

278
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,887
The rest of the funds I will
disperse at my discretion.

279
00:22:47,731 --> 00:22:49,198
Do I make myself clear?

280
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:52,633
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?

281
00:22:52,703 --> 00:22:55,695
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

282
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:59,436
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

283
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,035
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

284
00:23:02,112 --> 00:23:05,843
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

285
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,646
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

286
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:12,655
You've got 40 hours,
'til noon day after tomorrow
to arrange transfer of the money.

287
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:16,659
I am aware of your
countermeasure. You know and I
know it doesn't stand a chance.

288
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:20,561
Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

289
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:25,500
All right. We have to identify
the hostages and contact
each of their families.

290
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:29,528
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

291
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:33,838
If this comes out, the city
of San Francisco will be
in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

292
00:23:33,911 --> 00:23:37,506
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

293
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:42,746
for a single rocket armed with
V.X. Poison gas, General Peterson?

294
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,914
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

295
00:23:45,989 --> 00:23:50,892
- Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!
- Oh.

296
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:55,625
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

297
00:23:55,699 --> 00:23:59,567
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

298
00:23:59,636 --> 00:24:02,605
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

299
00:24:02,673 --> 00:24:05,039
Get the point?

300
00:24:05,108 --> 00:24:07,668
Uh, what did Hummel mean
by your countermeasure, General?

301
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:11,942
Standard poison is countered
by napalm. It burns it up,
consumes it upon detonation.

302
00:24:12,015 --> 00:24:14,381
Now, the problem
with V.X. Poison gas is...

303
00:24:14,451 --> 00:24:16,885
that it's designed specifically
to withstand napalm.

304
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:20,446
That's where, uh, thermite plasma
comes in. General Peterson?

305
00:24:20,524 --> 00:24:24,392
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume V. X...

306
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:28,056
but they're still in the test phase;
it's not operational.

307
00:24:28,131 --> 00:24:32,591
Hummel knows this. We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.

308
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:36,469
What's it gonna take to equip a flight
of F-18s with thermite plasma...

309
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,270
within the next 36 hours?

310
00:24:39,343 --> 00:24:41,903
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

311
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,843
All right, we can try.

312
00:24:44,915 --> 00:24:48,544
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

313
00:24:48,619 --> 00:24:50,883
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

314
00:24:50,954 --> 00:24:54,481
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Commander Anderson.

315
00:24:54,558 --> 00:24:59,291
Mr. Womack, who is
your best chemical/biological man?

316
00:24:59,429 --> 00:25:03,456
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

317
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:13,269
- You like my pigtails?
- Oh, yeah, the pigtails
are very naughty.

318
00:25:13,343 --> 00:25:16,244
Naughty. Naughty.

319
00:25:16,313 --> 00:25:20,716
Just the Amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

320
00:25:20,784 --> 00:25:23,218
- This isn't happening.
- No, Stan, don't answer it.

321
00:25:23,287 --> 00:25:26,347
- This isn't happening!
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

322
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:29,187
- I have to. It's the office,
baby. They know I'm home.
- No.

323
00:25:29,259 --> 00:25:31,955
How could they possibly know
that you're home?

324
00:25:32,029 --> 00:25:34,259
It's the FBI.

325
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:38,360
Stanley!

326
00:25:38,435 --> 00:25:41,097
Goodspeed.
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

327
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:43,537
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah,
downstairs in ten minutes.

328
00:25:43,607 --> 00:25:46,337
No, you won't.

329
00:25:48,045 --> 00:25:51,947
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

330
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:55,143
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

331
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:58,346
Are you kidding me right now?
You need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

332
00:25:58,422 --> 00:26:02,051
- I've got to go, baby.
- Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

333
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:06,357
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And
this causes a serious problem for me.

334
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,455
I cannot believe you.

335
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:19,375
No, no.

336
00:26:21,511 --> 00:26:24,844
I love you.
I will marry you.

337
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:27,645
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

338
00:26:29,286 --> 00:26:31,811
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

339
00:26:31,888 --> 00:26:33,822
Yeah, I'm sure it's just
a training exercise.

340
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:36,222
Check into the hotel.
Order up some champagne.

341
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:38,318
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

342
00:26:38,395 --> 00:26:40,158
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

343
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,926
You're gonna marry me!

344
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,834
- Oh, honey, come on.
Just a really quick one.
- Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

345
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:49,997
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out due to the full moon.

346
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:52,007
Likewise a frontal
seaside attack.

347
00:26:52,075 --> 00:26:55,408
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

348
00:26:55,479 --> 00:26:58,175
Our only alternative
is an attack from within the prison.

349
00:26:58,248 --> 00:27:01,740
We penetrate the island
through the tunnels under the
prison buildings undetected...

350
00:27:01,818 --> 00:27:04,787
and emerge in its center; that way
we can jump the marines from behind.

351
00:27:04,855 --> 00:27:08,621
And if we're lucky, take their
rocket positions without a shot fired.

352
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:11,183
I don't understand. You-you've studied
the architectural plans?

353
00:27:11,261 --> 00:27:15,220
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

354
00:27:15,298 --> 00:27:18,290
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

355
00:27:18,368 --> 00:27:20,893
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

356
00:27:20,971 --> 00:27:24,338
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

357
00:27:24,408 --> 00:27:26,569
All the guards we contacted
were useless.

358
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:31,637
Um, there is someone
who I think can help us.

359
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:36,910
- This is for the sake
of national security.
- No!

360
00:27:36,987 --> 00:27:40,718
It's the sake of national
security that got us here
in the first place 33 years ago.

361
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:43,624
I knew! I knew someday
this would come back to bite us.

362
00:27:43,694 --> 00:27:46,595
Forget it!
He does not exist.

363
00:27:46,663 --> 00:27:50,155
He does exist! We just chose
to forget him for 30 years.

364
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:53,396
- We locked him up
and threw away the key.
- Oh, and a lot of goddamn good
it did us.

365
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,236
He broke out of two maximum-security
prisons. And if he hits the streets...

366
00:27:57,307 --> 00:27:59,639
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

367
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:02,770
Thirty years ago he was
a highly-trained SAS operative.

368
00:28:02,846 --> 00:28:04,643
He is my age now,
for Christ's sake!

369
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:07,616
I have to get up three times
a night to take a piss.

370
00:28:07,684 --> 00:28:10,847
We can't risk
letting him out.

371
00:28:10,921 --> 00:28:14,584
He's a professional
escape artist.

372
00:28:47,824 --> 00:28:51,021
- Gosh. Neat, uh...
- Yeah.
- Neat, neat plane.

373
00:28:51,094 --> 00:28:53,028
Dr. Goodspeed.
James Womack.

374
00:28:53,096 --> 00:28:54,757
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

375
00:28:54,831 --> 00:28:56,696
You come very highly recommended.

376
00:28:56,767 --> 00:29:00,294
B.A. Columbia;
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

377
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,429
Biochemistry, toxicology.

378
00:29:02,506 --> 00:29:05,066
Well, I'm one of those fortunate
people who like my job, sir.

379
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:08,009
Got my first chemistry set when I
was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

380
00:29:08,078 --> 00:29:11,047
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

381
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:12,911
What do you know about V.X. Gas?

382
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:16,350
Liquid. Failed pesticide
discovered by a mistake in 1952.

383
00:29:16,419 --> 00:29:17,943
Uh, actually, it's kind of like
champagne that way.

384
00:29:18,021 --> 00:29:19,682
The Franciscan monks thought
they were making white wine.

385
00:29:19,756 --> 00:29:21,747
Somehow the bottle carbonated.
Voila! Champagne.

386
00:29:21,825 --> 00:29:24,419
- And then the whole thing just...
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

387
00:29:24,494 --> 00:29:26,758
It's very, very horrible, sir.

388
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,230
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

389
00:29:30,734 --> 00:29:32,827
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

390
00:29:32,903 --> 00:29:37,363
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

391
00:30:14,912 --> 00:30:16,539
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning, Director.

392
00:30:16,613 --> 00:30:19,411
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

393
00:30:19,483 --> 00:30:22,611
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

394
00:30:22,686 --> 00:30:27,123
It's been a fairly interesting day
so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

395
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:31,217
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.
Who is he anyway, sir?

396
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:34,162
His name is John Mason,
a British national...

397
00:30:34,231 --> 00:30:39,259
incarcerated on Alcatraz
in 1962, escaped in '63.

398
00:30:39,336 --> 00:30:41,964
I was under the impression that no one
ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

399
00:30:42,039 --> 00:30:44,303
Paxton, don't argue!

400
00:30:44,374 --> 00:30:48,504
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

401
00:30:48,579 --> 00:30:51,173
He does not exist. Understand?

402
00:30:51,248 --> 00:30:53,512
I want one thing:
How he escaped The Rock.

403
00:30:53,584 --> 00:30:56,678
Specifically the route he took
through the island's bowels.

404
00:30:56,753 --> 00:31:00,189
- The papers are in order, sir.
- We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

405
00:31:00,257 --> 00:31:04,887
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

406
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:07,362
Well, if you know him,
then why don't you question him?

407
00:31:07,431 --> 00:31:12,130
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

408
00:31:12,202 --> 00:31:13,669
All right, I'll take care of him.

409
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:26,247
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

410
00:31:26,316 --> 00:31:30,650
In charge of what? Fucking me over
for another three decades?

411
00:31:30,721 --> 00:31:33,713
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

412
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,191
a special situation exists that we feel
you might be able to help us with.

413
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,194
Well, what might that be?

414
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:43,596
I've been in jail longer than
Nelson Mandela, so maybe you
want me to run for president.

415
00:31:43,667 --> 00:31:46,966
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

416
00:31:47,037 --> 00:31:49,062
I feel rather like Alcamenes.

417
00:31:49,139 --> 00:31:53,542
- Who?
- Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

418
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,876
- Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.
- James the First.

419
00:31:57,948 --> 00:32:01,509
Even someone as bright as you
must be aware that, uh,

420
00:32:01,585 --> 00:32:03,985
there's a certain pattern
emerging here.

421
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:06,022
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

422
00:32:06,089 --> 00:32:09,490
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play
hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

423
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,722
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

424
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:15,526
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

425
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:18,033
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

426
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,331
You wanna hear what
I have to say or not?

427
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:25,103
By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.

428
00:32:25,175 --> 00:32:27,541
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

429
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:30,444
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

430
00:32:30,514 --> 00:32:34,041
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

431
00:32:34,117 --> 00:32:37,575
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

432
00:32:37,654 --> 00:32:40,589
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know The Rock.

433
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:44,058
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

434
00:32:44,127 --> 00:32:47,119
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself
a favor while you're helpin' us?

435
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:50,098
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

436
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:53,364
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil.

437
00:32:55,772 --> 00:32:57,865
While I'm considering your offer...

438
00:32:57,941 --> 00:33:02,139
I want a suite
in the Fairmont Hotel.

439
00:33:02,212 --> 00:33:05,978
You know I'm here
to cut you a deal.

440
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:10,213
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

441
00:33:10,287 --> 00:33:12,983
Here. Here's a quarter.

442
00:33:17,294 --> 00:33:22,061
Do yourself a favor. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

443
00:33:25,569 --> 00:33:28,163
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

444
00:33:28,238 --> 00:33:30,502
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

445
00:33:30,574 --> 00:33:32,371
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think we have time...

446
00:33:32,442 --> 00:33:33,807
for him to just sit around
and think about it.

447
00:33:33,877 --> 00:33:37,142
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.

448
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:39,409
- You go talk to him.
- Me?
- Yes.

449
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:42,077
- Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- You're an FBI agent!

450
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:44,279
- W-What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.

451
00:33:44,354 --> 00:33:47,084
Don't mention that!

452
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:53,189
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

453
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:57,965
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

454
00:33:59,569 --> 00:34:01,560
Okay.

455
00:34:06,476 --> 00:34:08,808
Hi.

456
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:12,940
I'm an agent with the, uh,
uh, F-Federal...

457
00:34:13,016 --> 00:34:15,883
FBI. Uh...

458
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:19,718
- Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

459
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,315
Well, at least
he got his name right.

460
00:34:22,392 --> 00:34:26,158
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

461
00:34:26,229 --> 00:34:29,630
That's right.

462
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,929
And you need my help.

463
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:33,993
Exactly right.

464
00:34:35,505 --> 00:34:38,531
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

465
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:41,600
Offer me coffee.

466
00:34:41,678 --> 00:34:44,374
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next...

467
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:47,211
Can we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

468
00:34:47,284 --> 00:34:50,185
And offer to take these off.

469
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,545
Mr. Mason, really.

470
00:34:52,622 --> 00:34:56,353
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

471
00:34:58,995 --> 00:35:02,897
- Prisoner requests to have
his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no, no.

472
00:35:05,101 --> 00:35:07,399
Why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?

473
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,200
Well, I guess
that's one way to go.

474
00:35:12,676 --> 00:35:16,407
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

475
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:20,540
Now, it makes you a free man
provided you cooperate.

476
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:23,984
So if you'll just, uh, sign...

477
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,079
uh, at, uh, where it says...

478
00:35:26,156 --> 00:35:29,421
- "Signature"?
- That's... Yes. "Signature."

479
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:34,452
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

480
00:35:34,531 --> 00:35:37,591
"I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

481
00:35:37,667 --> 00:35:40,295
Oh, an educated man!

482
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:45,467
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

483
00:35:45,542 --> 00:35:48,443
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

484
00:35:48,511 --> 00:35:50,843
- Really?
- Yes.

485
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:54,611
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

486
00:35:54,684 --> 00:35:58,780
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

487
00:35:59,956 --> 00:36:02,789
Well-trained.

488
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:05,828
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

489
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,365
Okay.

490
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:13,368
I want a suite,
a shower, a shave...

491
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:15,336
and the feel of a suit.

492
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:18,636
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

493
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:23,042
- Am I out of style?
- Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

494
00:36:23,113 --> 00:36:25,343
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

495
00:36:25,415 --> 00:36:28,441
Yeah, well, uh, uh...
Okay, thank you very much.

496
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:33,182
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,
but I want him sealed off.

497
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:36,248
And he gets two hours max.

498
00:36:51,041 --> 00:36:54,272
- Great job, Goodspeed.
- Why didn't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you were at it?

499
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:57,802
- I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.
- Uh, no, you'll give it to me.
Give it to me, Reynolds.

500
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:02,716
And take Attorney Reynolds
outside. There's a car
waiting for you. Thank you.

501
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:08,616
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

502
00:37:08,692 --> 00:37:11,217
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

503
00:37:11,294 --> 00:37:15,697
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

504
00:37:15,765 --> 00:37:21,135
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

505
00:37:21,204 --> 00:37:24,230
It's, uh, it's, eh,
kind of curious, but, uh,

506
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:26,639
Sir Walter Raleigh,
Alcamenes, Solzhenitsyn,

507
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:29,577
they, um, well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

508
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:43,687
Womack! Now, why am I not surprised,
you piece of shit!

509
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,058
Eh, peace! Peace!

510
00:37:53,636 --> 00:37:55,900
Hey, we're not home.
Leave a message.

511
00:37:55,972 --> 00:37:58,133
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

512
00:37:58,208 --> 00:38:01,268
Uh, listen, don't come
to San Francisco.

513
00:38:01,344 --> 00:38:03,869
I repeat, do not come
to San Francisco.

514
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:05,505
- Stanley, no!
- Carla.
- Wha...

515
00:38:05,582 --> 00:38:07,049
- Carla.
- Like hell I'm not coming!

516
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:09,585
Wait. Car...

517
00:38:13,823 --> 00:38:17,919
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

518
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,936
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

519
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:29,972
Watch it, he'll bite you.

520
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:40,884
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

521
00:38:40,884 --> 00:38:41,748
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

522
00:38:41,818 --> 00:38:45,345
- We'll be there in
approximately two hours.
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

523
00:38:45,421 --> 00:38:48,151
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

524
00:38:49,459 --> 00:38:52,451
I left it in my,
uh, my sock drawer.

525
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,459
A gun?

526
00:38:55,531 --> 00:38:59,228
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

527
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:03,796
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually. But I still need a gun.

528
00:39:04,741 --> 00:39:07,073
Give him a goddamn gun.

529
00:39:09,012 --> 00:39:12,140
Have you fired one of
those things since the Academy?

530
00:39:12,215 --> 00:39:16,311
- Wear some flowers in your hair
- If you're going to San Francisco

531
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:19,082
Don't forget to wear
flowers in your hair

532
00:39:19,155 --> 00:39:21,680
- If you're going
- If you're going

533
00:39:21,758 --> 00:39:26,354
- To San Francisco
- To San Francisco

534
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:29,956
- You're sure to meet
some gentle people there
- You're gonna meet

535
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:35,767
- Some gentle people there
- And you come for...

536
00:39:35,838 --> 00:39:38,739
If you're going
to San Francisco

537
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:41,276
Uh, uh, room service?

538
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:45,804
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

539
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:48,076
Hello!

540
00:39:48,151 --> 00:39:50,483
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

541
00:39:50,553 --> 00:39:53,113
Barber.

542
00:39:53,189 --> 00:39:57,091
- Just clippers. No scissors.
- No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors!

543
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,492
I mean, did they tell Picasso,
"No brush"?

544
00:39:59,562 --> 00:40:01,393
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

545
00:40:01,464 --> 00:40:06,265
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can I?

546
00:40:06,336 --> 00:40:09,430
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

547
00:40:11,674 --> 00:40:15,804
Oh, who did this to you? This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

548
00:40:15,878 --> 00:40:17,903
Well, it's a grunge thing.

549
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:19,972
Well, it's some kind of thing.

550
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:22,984
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?

551
00:40:23,052 --> 00:40:25,316
No.

552
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:29,256
Okay. Not very nice, is he?

553
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,316
No, he's not.

554
00:40:45,742 --> 00:40:48,302
'Cause I'm leavin'

555
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:50,778
Hey, somebody ordered it.
Can't let it go to waste.

556
00:40:50,847 --> 00:40:53,975
- Don't know when I'll be back again
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?

557
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,245
Not when it's free.

558
00:40:56,319 --> 00:40:59,584
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

559
00:40:59,655 --> 00:41:02,590
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on.
Have... Try some of this lobster.

560
00:41:02,658 --> 00:41:07,027
- Mm-hmm.
- My secretary here will settle the bill.

561
00:41:07,096 --> 00:41:10,429
So what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?

562
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,367
You'll get your life back, Mason.

563
00:41:13,436 --> 00:41:16,303
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

564
00:41:20,543 --> 00:41:25,207
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

565
00:41:25,281 --> 00:41:28,444
Will you shake on it?

566
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:42,288
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

567
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,097
Help!

568
00:41:45,168 --> 00:41:48,069
Drop the gun,
or I drop your boss.

569
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:51,334
You will not!

570
00:41:51,407 --> 00:41:53,307
Get!

571
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:56,004
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

572
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:03,419
Please don't!

573
00:42:03,486 --> 00:42:06,284
Help! Shit!

574
00:42:06,355 --> 00:42:09,119
Come on. Have a scallop.
Come on. Catch.

575
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:19,429
You hoist him!

576
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:21,493
Help! Help! Help!

577
00:42:21,571 --> 00:42:23,766
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

578
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,139
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

579
00:42:29,312 --> 00:42:31,439
Clear.

580
00:42:32,181 --> 00:42:34,149
Living room's clear!

581
00:42:34,217 --> 00:42:37,516
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

582
00:42:37,587 --> 00:42:40,488
All units, this is Caretaker.
We have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

583
00:42:46,896 --> 00:42:51,162
Okay, I don't wanna know
nothin'. I never saw you throw
that gentleman off the balcony.

584
00:42:51,234 --> 00:42:55,466
All I care about is, a-are
you happy with your haircut?

585
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:58,302
Easy!

586
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:03,371
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

587
00:43:04,714 --> 00:43:07,148
Watch out!

588
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:13,812
Oh, no!

589
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,989
Watch it!

590
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,764
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

591
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,180
Hey!

592
00:43:48,257 --> 00:43:53,786
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches,
or I'll have your ass. Hey!

593
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:55,524
Hey! Stop! Hey!

594
00:44:00,937 --> 00:44:02,905
Hey, I was inside the bedroom
with Jack Powell!

595
00:44:02,972 --> 00:44:04,701
Hey, call the guard! Go!

596
00:44:07,743 --> 00:44:09,870
FBI.

597
00:44:20,523 --> 00:44:22,252
Move!

598
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:31,630
Whoa! Whoa!

599
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:35,262
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

600
00:44:35,338 --> 00:44:37,465
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

601
00:44:44,513 --> 00:44:48,142
Get out of the way!

602
00:44:50,186 --> 00:44:52,677
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

603
00:45:25,755 --> 00:45:28,724
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing
in sight tryin' to block us!

604
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:09,728
I hope you're insured!

605
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,570
Oh, well, why not?

606
00:46:36,258 --> 00:46:38,749
You're goin' down!

607
00:47:01,016 --> 00:47:04,076
Hello?

608
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:06,620
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

609
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:14,353
Information? San Francisco?

610
00:47:14,429 --> 00:47:17,592
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G...

611
00:47:19,701 --> 00:47:22,135
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

612
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:27,665
Hang on!

613
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:33,176
Holy shit!

614
00:47:43,025 --> 00:47:45,186
Whoa-oa!

615
00:47:46,862 --> 00:47:49,831
Oh, no!

616
00:47:53,735 --> 00:47:56,033
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

617
00:48:01,610 --> 00:48:03,771
Oh, my baby!

618
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:09,540
Oh, no!

619
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:25,867
Oh, no.

620
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:31,696
Oh, God!

621
00:48:32,607 --> 00:48:34,472
Oh, God!

622
00:48:53,295 --> 00:48:56,890
Hey, man, you just fucked up
your Ferrari.

623
00:48:56,965 --> 00:49:00,901
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

624
00:49:00,969 --> 00:49:02,596
Neither is this!

625
00:49:06,675 --> 00:49:10,111
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

626
00:49:10,178 --> 00:49:13,909
I'm gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

627
00:49:15,751 --> 00:49:20,211
- Chem weapons. Isherwood.
- Marvin, look up Wolfburg
Federal Penitentiary.

628
00:49:20,288 --> 00:49:22,279
The inmate is Mason, John.

629
00:49:22,357 --> 00:49:25,326
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

630
00:49:25,394 --> 00:49:28,363
I'm goin' over to Orkin to
design roach motels. Cool, huh?

631
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,022
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

632
00:49:30,098 --> 00:49:32,566
I'm not really feeling too good
about it, okay? Wolfburg. Got it?

633
00:49:32,634 --> 00:49:37,094
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

634
00:49:37,172 --> 00:49:41,973
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

635
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:45,840
This is weird.
They got medical records.

636
00:49:45,914 --> 00:49:51,284
They got place of birth. Glasgow.
Uh, but they don't have a name.

637
00:49:51,353 --> 00:49:53,048
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
They have next of kin.

638
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:57,421
A Jade Angelou
of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

639
00:50:17,112 --> 00:50:18,841
Jade?

640
00:50:18,914 --> 00:50:22,645
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

641
00:50:27,956 --> 00:50:30,254
Were you afraid
to come alone?

642
00:50:30,325 --> 00:50:32,316
Yeah.

643
00:50:33,995 --> 00:50:37,192
- It's okay.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

644
00:50:37,265 --> 00:50:41,429
The last photograph I had of you,
you were about ten.

645
00:50:41,503 --> 00:50:43,403
Yeah?

646
00:50:43,472 --> 00:50:48,535
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things when she died.

647
00:50:49,911 --> 00:50:54,974
Oh, yeah? Well, uh...
Why don't we take a walk?

648
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:57,951
I got 'im.
Palace of Fine Arts.

649
00:50:58,019 --> 00:51:02,183
Your mother, uh... Yeah, well,
sh-she was very special.

650
00:51:02,257 --> 00:51:04,623
Yeah, she was.

651
00:51:04,693 --> 00:51:08,823
But I don't think that we
should romanticize what happened
between you and her.

652
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:11,798
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

653
00:51:11,867 --> 00:51:14,631
Head out, and I was the result.

654
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:17,604
Well, I'd like to think it
would've led somewhere if only...

655
00:51:17,672 --> 00:51:20,869
If only what? Six federal marshals
hadn't kicked down our door...

656
00:51:20,942 --> 00:51:23,536
and dragged you back to prison?

657
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:27,638
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

658
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:33,014
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

659
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:35,079
That's good.

660
00:51:37,092 --> 00:51:39,720
What did you do?

661
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:41,523
J...

662
00:51:44,633 --> 00:51:50,094
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

663
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:52,935
But I'll be coming back.
And, uh...

664
00:51:53,008 --> 00:51:56,671
- Maybe we can...
- What? We can what?

665
00:51:58,179 --> 00:52:02,707
You know, you're almost
the only evidence...

666
00:52:02,784 --> 00:52:05,252
that I exist.

667
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,220
But I don't know you.

668
00:52:07,289 --> 00:52:09,382
That's what I want to change, eh?

669
00:52:14,362 --> 00:52:18,423
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

670
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:21,401
Here we are, and I'm lost.

671
00:52:21,469 --> 00:52:24,370
Well, I don't know how
I'm supposed to be feeling either.

672
00:52:25,206 --> 00:52:28,437
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

673
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:31,707
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

674
00:52:35,584 --> 00:52:37,313
Okay.

675
00:52:48,296 --> 00:52:50,730
Is this about you?

676
00:53:02,477 --> 00:53:07,938
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you? Why did you come to me?

677
00:53:08,016 --> 00:53:11,816
FBI, ma'am.
Your father's working with us.

678
00:53:11,886 --> 00:53:13,911
He's helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

679
00:53:13,989 --> 00:53:16,423
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

680
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:19,460
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

681
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:22,018
Whatever you say, Stanley.

682
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:30,704
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

683
00:53:30,772 --> 00:53:34,003
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

684
00:53:34,075 --> 00:53:38,136
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

685
00:53:39,214 --> 00:53:41,114
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

686
00:53:41,182 --> 00:53:44,015
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

687
00:53:44,085 --> 00:53:47,543
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

688
00:53:47,622 --> 00:53:50,716
You wrecked half the city!

689
00:53:54,162 --> 00:53:56,323
Now, tell me about the tunnels.

690
00:53:56,398 --> 00:54:01,700
If you know the system, it will
take you wherever you need to go.

691
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,900
All right, there's an intake pipe here,
below low tide. Is that our best access?

692
00:54:05,974 --> 00:54:08,272
Yes. That's exactly
where I had come out.

693
00:54:08,343 --> 00:54:10,480
Then beneath the cistern,
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

694
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:11,845
Then beneath the cistern,
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

695
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,609
How many feet is that?

696
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,880
Uh, 57 paces.

697
00:54:16,953 --> 00:54:19,080
Where do we go from there?

698
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:25,190
Where do we go from there?

699
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,752
That's a good question.

700
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:32,567
- I have no idea.
- What?

701
00:54:32,635 --> 00:54:35,934
I mean, I'll know it
when we're all inside.

702
00:54:36,005 --> 00:54:39,463
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

703
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:43,842
I can't! My blueprint
was in my head.

704
00:54:43,913 --> 00:54:47,246
I was underground
for three days in the dark...

705
00:54:47,316 --> 00:54:49,944
just waiting for the tides
to be right.

706
00:54:50,019 --> 00:54:53,511
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

707
00:54:53,589 --> 00:54:56,183
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

708
00:54:56,259 --> 00:55:01,526
Wait a second. Now, this piece
of work might be the only chance
those people over there have.

709
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:04,225
If he's not going, then why the
hell did we get him out of jail?

710
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,758
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

711
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:12,035
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

712
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:13,871
He'll fuck with you.

713
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:17,743
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

714
00:55:19,782 --> 00:55:21,807
Now, Womack...

715
00:55:21,884 --> 00:55:24,580
you're between The Rock
and a hard case.

716
00:55:27,423 --> 00:55:30,153
How is your bowling arm?

717
00:55:31,561 --> 00:55:33,893
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is
to take out the launchers,

718
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:35,954
then neutralize
the V.X. Chemical rounds.

719
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:39,627
Well, we know the poison's being
kept in the prison morgue from
the satellite thermal imaging...

720
00:55:39,702 --> 00:55:42,432
which is right here;
these colorized dots.

721
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:46,771
- Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?
- No, sir, but I've studied them.

722
00:55:46,842 --> 00:55:50,300
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

723
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:53,041
Got a really neat layout over here of
the chem round as well as the rocket...

724
00:55:53,115 --> 00:55:56,016
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

725
00:55:58,487 --> 00:56:01,115
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

726
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:04,523
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

727
00:56:04,594 --> 00:56:06,289
An ecological disaster, sir.

728
00:56:06,362 --> 00:56:08,830
Plus the devices themselves
are complicated.

729
00:56:08,898 --> 00:56:10,388
That's why you're
coming with us.

730
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:18,438
- I am?
- You're the expert. What's your problem?

731
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:23,206
You mean I'm going, going out there,
under the water?

732
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,543
Well, earlier today
you wanted a gun.

733
00:56:25,615 --> 00:56:27,879
Now you're getting a gun
and a wet suit.

734
00:56:27,950 --> 00:56:30,646
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

735
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,245
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

736
00:56:33,322 --> 00:56:36,849
An incursion underwater to
retake an impregnable fortress
held by an elite team...

737
00:56:36,926 --> 00:56:40,123
of U.S. Marines in possession
of 81 hostages and 15 guided rockets...

738
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:43,290
armed with V.X. Poisoned gas.

739
00:56:43,366 --> 00:56:47,166
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

740
00:56:53,609 --> 00:56:55,543
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

741
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,874
You don't look too good.

742
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,646
In fact, you look like shit.

743
00:57:03,719 --> 00:57:07,018
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

744
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,450
You all right?

745
00:57:10,526 --> 00:57:12,687
I mean, you gonna make it
through this thing?

746
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,855
I don't know.

747
00:57:14,930 --> 00:57:17,364
I always expected something
like this was going to happen...

748
00:57:17,433 --> 00:57:20,266
but nothing prepares you for it.

749
00:57:20,336 --> 00:57:22,702
Now I'm...
I'm responsible...

750
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,740
for a whole city.

751
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:29,540
Look, I know this
isn't easy for you.

752
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,910
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of a situation...

753
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,972
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

754
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,486
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backing you up.

755
00:57:37,553 --> 00:57:41,319
Okay. You're right.

756
00:57:41,390 --> 00:57:45,019
I-I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

757
00:57:45,094 --> 00:57:47,927
There's something else.

758
00:57:47,997 --> 00:57:51,558
It's terrible.
N-No, it's wonderful...

759
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:54,102
except it isn't.

760
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,469
My girlfriend's pregnant...

761
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,442
and she's just flown in to see me.

762
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,274
You keep your mind on what you're going
to be doing out there tonight.

763
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:08,484
And I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command center.

764
00:58:20,128 --> 00:58:24,030
Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

765
00:58:24,099 --> 00:58:27,830
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

766
00:58:27,903 --> 00:58:31,839
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

767
00:58:31,907 --> 00:58:35,502
- Don't tell me problems.
Tell me solutions.
- Now, we've spoken to the president...

768
00:58:35,577 --> 00:58:37,875
and I know that you're
well aware of his stance on terrorism.

769
00:58:37,946 --> 00:58:43,213
- So what we'd like to do is...
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

770
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:45,947
It's about reminding you people
who found it politically
convenient to forget.

771
00:58:46,021 --> 00:58:48,387
This is goin' nowhere, Frank.

772
00:58:48,457 --> 00:58:50,186
Well, then, let me tell you what is.

773
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:52,784
Fifteen V.X. Gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

774
00:58:52,861 --> 00:58:55,159
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

775
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,960
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

776
00:59:03,071 --> 00:59:05,835
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us...

777
00:59:05,908 --> 00:59:09,071
no definite assurance
on the thermite plasma.

778
00:59:09,144 --> 00:59:11,271
That is the word.

779
00:59:15,918 --> 00:59:17,852
Green light to SEAL incursion.

780
00:59:36,003 --> 00:59:39,461
Fall in! All right, listen up.

781
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,667
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

782
00:59:41,742 --> 00:59:43,733
Lieutenant Shepard
will be attached to his hip.

783
00:59:43,811 --> 00:59:47,838
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps.

784
00:59:47,915 --> 00:59:50,042
Understood?

785
00:59:50,117 --> 00:59:52,312
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.

786
00:59:52,386 --> 00:59:57,187
When he neutralizes the threat,
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

787
00:59:57,258 --> 01:00:01,319
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives...

788
01:00:01,395 --> 01:00:04,364
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander in the Vietnam War.

789
01:00:04,431 --> 01:00:06,661
I shit you not.

790
01:00:06,734 --> 01:00:08,668
Any questions?

791
01:00:10,070 --> 01:00:12,402
Let's load up!

792
01:00:20,581 --> 01:00:22,981
After you, ace.

793
01:00:44,071 --> 01:00:46,904
Pass out and activate
the minicams.

794
01:00:49,376 --> 01:00:53,312
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?

795
01:00:54,415 --> 01:00:56,781
Roger that, sir.
We are on-line.

796
01:01:00,521 --> 01:01:05,549
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

797
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:10,791
Uh, let's see.
We have, uh...

798
01:01:10,864 --> 01:01:13,662
one quart of kerosene
in a squeeze bottle.

799
01:01:15,769 --> 01:01:21,537
Three washers and waterproof matches.

800
01:01:21,608 --> 01:01:24,975
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

801
01:01:25,045 --> 01:01:27,445
Now, this is atropine.
If you come in contact with the gas...

802
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:29,744
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

803
01:01:29,817 --> 01:01:33,150
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

804
01:01:36,724 --> 01:01:39,818
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 275.

805
01:01:39,893 --> 01:01:42,327
Range: 6,000 meters.

806
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:48,759
FBI Command Center?

807
01:01:48,836 --> 01:01:51,999
- Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.
- Nope.

808
01:01:52,072 --> 01:01:55,803
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed
is my boyfriend.
Actually, he's, um, my fiance.

809
01:01:55,876 --> 01:01:57,810
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

810
01:01:57,878 --> 01:02:00,870
Okay. Well, you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

811
01:02:00,948 --> 01:02:03,143
Hey, where are you g...
Goddamn it!

812
01:02:08,188 --> 01:02:10,782
Decoy choppers
commencing run to Alcatraz.

813
01:02:12,493 --> 01:02:14,688
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

814
01:02:14,762 --> 01:02:18,755
- We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.
- Shit!

815
01:02:28,342 --> 01:02:32,005
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

816
01:02:32,079 --> 01:02:35,446
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

817
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:38,576
I don't...
I don't know anything about you.

818
01:02:38,652 --> 01:02:41,120
- Hmm. I know something
about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

819
01:02:41,188 --> 01:02:44,885
Goodspeed, Godspeed,
Godspell...

820
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:47,688
you never went to
any antiterrorist school.

821
01:02:47,761 --> 01:02:50,696
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

822
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,799
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

823
01:02:58,405 --> 01:03:00,703
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage...

824
01:03:00,774 --> 01:03:02,708
heading around
Treasure Island.

825
01:03:04,645 --> 01:03:07,876
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

826
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,653
Decoys?

827
01:03:14,721 --> 01:03:17,713
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

828
01:03:22,796 --> 01:03:24,764
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

829
01:03:27,134 --> 01:03:30,262
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

830
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:33,830
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

831
01:03:33,907 --> 01:03:37,673
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

832
01:03:47,121 --> 01:03:49,919
All right, so the S.D.U. S
have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

833
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:02,134
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

834
01:04:02,202 --> 01:04:04,363
- Double-time it.
- Yes, sir. Hendrix!

835
01:04:04,438 --> 01:04:06,463
- You lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

836
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,599
Let's move. Move out!
Move out! Move out!

837
01:05:05,499 --> 01:05:09,026
The Eagles are on The Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

838
01:05:15,242 --> 01:05:17,540
Thank you very fucking much,
Mr. Mason.

839
01:05:17,611 --> 01:05:19,943
You've led us into a room
with no exit.

840
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:26,852
- Any ideas, Dillinger?
- Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

841
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,512
We're a little tight on time.

842
01:05:28,589 --> 01:05:31,888
You stand by the door
until I open it.

843
01:05:31,959 --> 01:05:35,190
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that?

844
01:05:36,230 --> 01:05:38,460
Through here.

845
01:05:44,605 --> 01:05:48,200
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

846
01:05:48,275 --> 01:05:50,209
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

847
01:05:50,277 --> 01:05:53,246
You catch one of those flame bursts,
you're a corpse.

848
01:05:53,313 --> 01:05:56,578
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never
to leave his sight, but, uh...

849
01:05:56,650 --> 01:05:58,709
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

850
01:05:59,620 --> 01:06:01,645
Have a nice day.

851
01:06:24,044 --> 01:06:27,844
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

852
01:06:35,155 --> 01:06:38,090
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

853
01:06:38,158 --> 01:06:41,924
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

854
01:06:41,995 --> 01:06:44,293
Sweep forward!

855
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,902
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

856
01:06:55,976 --> 01:06:59,104
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

857
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:06,485
Welcome to The Rock.

858
01:07:21,668 --> 01:07:24,068
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

859
01:07:24,137 --> 01:07:27,937
That's the subway.
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

860
01:07:28,008 --> 01:07:30,169
Do it!

861
01:07:46,659 --> 01:07:50,151
Sir, the Eagles have breached
the tunnel system.

862
01:07:56,469 --> 01:07:59,063
You enjoying this?

863
01:07:59,138 --> 01:08:02,232
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable
than my average day.

864
01:08:02,308 --> 01:08:06,745
Reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

865
01:08:06,813 --> 01:08:10,806
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

866
01:08:15,288 --> 01:08:18,553
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

867
01:08:18,625 --> 01:08:21,423
Continue patrolling the area.

868
01:08:21,494 --> 01:08:23,428
Sweep forward!

869
01:08:24,764 --> 01:08:26,925
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

870
01:08:28,901 --> 01:08:31,631
- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
- Stand fast.

871
01:08:31,704 --> 01:08:34,537
Down, down, down.

872
01:08:39,779 --> 01:08:42,407
West storm drain's clear.

873
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,485
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

874
01:08:54,727 --> 01:08:57,992
The Eagles are now at the access
tunnel. They're right under
the shower room, sir.

875
01:09:05,805 --> 01:09:07,932
Fiber optics.

876
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:14,171
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

877
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,668
Quiet.

878
01:09:45,378 --> 01:09:48,438
Motion sensors.

879
01:09:48,514 --> 01:09:52,541
- Beams cutting across
the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

880
01:09:56,856 --> 01:10:00,815
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

881
01:10:00,893 --> 01:10:03,726
Possibly a prism.

882
01:10:06,032 --> 01:10:09,263
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam...

883
01:10:09,335 --> 01:10:13,669
send the beam back to its source,
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

884
01:10:18,077 --> 01:10:20,602
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

885
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,841
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

886
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:29,419
Got it.
Good to go.

887
01:10:29,489 --> 01:10:33,755
- Fuck, man! I knew this
would happen! Fuck!
- Move!

888
01:10:33,826 --> 01:10:36,021
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

889
01:10:46,939 --> 01:10:50,431
They're entering
into the shower room, sir.

890
01:10:52,979 --> 01:10:55,607
They're securing the area.

891
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,791
Just sit tight.

892
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:12,362
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

893
01:11:12,432 --> 01:11:14,627
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

894
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:16,793
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

895
01:11:19,739 --> 01:11:23,368
It's a fucking trap.

896
01:11:23,443 --> 01:11:25,138
This is General Hummel.

897
01:11:25,211 --> 01:11:28,942
Drop your weapons. Drop 'em!

898
01:11:29,015 --> 01:11:32,041
Anderson here,
General Hummel.

899
01:11:32,118 --> 01:11:34,712
Commander. Team leader.

900
01:11:34,787 --> 01:11:37,779
Commander Anderson, if you have
any concern for the lives of your men...

901
01:11:37,857 --> 01:11:40,917
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

902
01:11:40,993 --> 01:11:42,893
This is not happening.

903
01:11:42,962 --> 01:11:46,420
Sir, we know why
you're out here.

904
01:11:46,499 --> 01:11:48,865
God knows I agree with you.

905
01:11:48,935 --> 01:11:52,200
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies...

906
01:11:52,271 --> 01:11:57,368
foreign, sir, and domestic.

907
01:11:57,443 --> 01:12:00,970
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

908
01:12:01,047 --> 01:12:03,982
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

909
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:05,574
We're dead.

910
01:12:05,651 --> 01:12:09,143
Your unit is covered
from an elevated position, Commander.

911
01:12:09,222 --> 01:12:12,988
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

912
01:12:13,125 --> 01:12:15,525
No one has to die here.

913
01:12:15,595 --> 01:12:20,032
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

914
01:12:20,099 --> 01:12:23,159
Have you forgotten that?

915
01:12:23,236 --> 01:12:25,363
We all have shipmates
we remember.

916
01:12:25,438 --> 01:12:28,839
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

917
01:12:28,908 --> 01:12:33,004
- But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!
- You call it what you want!

918
01:12:33,079 --> 01:12:37,106
You're down there, we're up here.
You walked into the wrong
goddamn room, Commander!

919
01:12:37,183 --> 01:12:39,151
- Stand fast!
- Goddamn it, Commander, one last time.

920
01:12:39,218 --> 01:12:41,379
You tell your men to safety
their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

921
01:12:41,454 --> 01:12:44,048
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

922
01:12:44,123 --> 01:12:46,990
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

923
01:12:47,059 --> 01:12:49,857
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

924
01:12:49,929 --> 01:12:53,421
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time. You order your
men to safety their weapons...

925
01:13:00,907 --> 01:13:02,966
Cease fire!

926
01:13:22,061 --> 01:13:24,655
Don't go.

927
01:13:26,566 --> 01:13:28,500
Cease fire!

928
01:13:37,376 --> 01:13:39,310
Cease fire!

929
01:13:39,378 --> 01:13:41,539
Shit! Goddamn it!

930
01:13:41,614 --> 01:13:44,014
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

931
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:46,210
Don't. Don't go.

932
01:14:35,334 --> 01:14:37,268
It's over.

933
01:14:47,113 --> 01:14:49,104
Oh, God!

934
01:15:08,167 --> 01:15:10,226
Later.

935
01:15:20,647 --> 01:15:23,115
- We got some movement.
- Who?
- Two of 'em!

936
01:15:23,183 --> 01:15:24,912
- Who is it?
- Eagles 11 and 12.

937
01:15:24,985 --> 01:15:27,749
- L-lt's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

938
01:15:27,821 --> 01:15:30,517
I've gotta get a team together
right now. We've gotta move
with the second option.

939
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:32,888
What, and invite
another massacre? No way.

940
01:15:32,959 --> 01:15:37,726
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

941
01:15:37,797 --> 01:15:39,958
Not for Mason, it isn't.

942
01:15:51,811 --> 01:15:55,508
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

943
01:15:58,018 --> 01:16:00,851
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

944
01:16:00,921 --> 01:16:03,583
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

945
01:16:03,657 --> 01:16:07,354
Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?

946
01:16:07,427 --> 01:16:09,361
It's for you.

947
01:16:10,630 --> 01:16:12,962
- Sir?
- What's the status?

948
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:15,831
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

949
01:16:15,902 --> 01:16:17,961
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

950
01:16:18,038 --> 01:16:22,372
That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

951
01:16:22,442 --> 01:16:25,070
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

952
01:16:25,145 --> 01:16:28,273
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

953
01:16:28,348 --> 01:16:31,078
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

954
01:16:33,119 --> 01:16:35,417
I didn't want this.

955
01:16:35,488 --> 01:16:38,150
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

956
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:41,352
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

957
01:16:41,428 --> 01:16:43,988
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

958
01:16:44,064 --> 01:16:47,295
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

959
01:16:47,367 --> 01:16:50,996
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, Captain.

960
01:17:09,389 --> 01:17:11,323
Sir?

961
01:17:14,794 --> 01:17:17,262
You made a terrible mistake.

962
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:20,595
And more of our brothers
have died in vain.

963
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:23,795
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

964
01:17:27,207 --> 01:17:29,869
I need to talk to you
right now, alone.

965
01:17:29,943 --> 01:17:32,411
Now you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis.

966
01:17:32,479 --> 01:17:37,781
And I'm tellin' you right now,
I need to know who the fuck
John Mason is right now, sir.

967
01:17:37,851 --> 01:17:41,981
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

968
01:17:42,055 --> 01:17:44,853
is head of the FBI,
some say the country.

969
01:17:44,924 --> 01:17:48,883
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

970
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:52,557
De Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the prime minister.

971
01:17:52,632 --> 01:17:55,760
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

972
01:17:55,835 --> 01:17:59,464
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

973
01:17:59,539 --> 01:18:02,303
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

974
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:05,173
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

975
01:18:05,245 --> 01:18:08,612
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

976
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:10,650
And we held him
without trial...

977
01:18:10,717 --> 01:18:15,120
until he gave up the microfilm,
but he never did.

978
01:18:15,188 --> 01:18:17,952
Well, I'm surprised Hoover
didn't use his daughter as leverage.

979
01:18:18,024 --> 01:18:21,323
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

980
01:18:21,394 --> 01:18:25,023
Today, well, it's
a different Bureau.

981
01:18:25,098 --> 01:18:29,398
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

982
01:18:29,469 --> 01:18:33,929
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

983
01:18:34,007 --> 01:18:38,273
The alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. Assassination.

984
01:18:38,344 --> 01:18:42,144
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

985
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:47,810
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

986
01:18:47,887 --> 01:18:50,856
Mason! Mason!

987
01:18:52,959 --> 01:18:55,427
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

988
01:18:55,495 --> 01:18:57,326
Yeah, like me.

989
01:18:57,397 --> 01:19:00,059
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

990
01:19:00,133 --> 01:19:02,966
Okay. FBI!
Freeze, sucker!

991
01:19:04,971 --> 01:19:09,237
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

992
01:19:09,309 --> 01:19:12,972
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

993
01:19:13,046 --> 01:19:15,844
Let's find out.

994
01:19:18,485 --> 01:19:22,182
I could; you, no.

995
01:19:22,255 --> 01:19:24,723
Besides, your safety's on.

996
01:19:24,791 --> 01:19:28,420
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

997
01:19:30,830 --> 01:19:33,492
Not yet.

998
01:19:33,566 --> 01:19:37,002
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

999
01:19:37,070 --> 01:19:39,595
You're right, I don't use guns
and I don't kick down doors.

1000
01:19:39,672 --> 01:19:42,436
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

1001
01:19:42,509 --> 01:19:46,878
What it says
is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

1002
01:19:46,946 --> 01:19:50,882
That's right.
I got a lunatic up there, man...

1003
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:54,545
with 15 missiles armed
with some really funky stuff.

1004
01:19:54,621 --> 01:19:59,456
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1005
01:19:59,526 --> 01:20:04,054
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1006
01:20:04,130 --> 01:20:07,361
They've got my girlfriend in
the city with a baby on the way.

1007
01:20:07,433 --> 01:20:11,563
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1008
01:20:11,638 --> 01:20:13,697
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1009
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:24,883
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

1010
01:20:24,951 --> 01:20:28,648
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1011
01:20:28,721 --> 01:20:31,588
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island.
Check every access you can find.

1012
01:20:31,658 --> 01:20:33,751
Sir.

1013
01:20:39,432 --> 01:20:42,162
Even if you escape
from the island...

1014
01:20:42,235 --> 01:20:45,500
you can't escape
the rockets.

1015
01:20:45,572 --> 01:20:49,269
So, where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

1016
01:20:53,213 --> 01:20:56,410
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

1017
01:20:59,819 --> 01:21:02,481
What about your daughter? Mason?

1018
01:21:04,691 --> 01:21:07,216
Rodents located.

1019
01:21:07,293 --> 01:21:11,593
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1020
01:21:11,664 --> 01:21:14,030
I don't think you do.

1021
01:21:24,978 --> 01:21:27,173
Move!

1022
01:21:51,671 --> 01:21:53,332
They're onto us.

1023
01:21:53,406 --> 01:21:55,670
Burn 'em out.

1024
01:21:57,844 --> 01:22:00,108
This mother's gonna blow big.

1025
01:22:41,888 --> 01:22:45,289
I don't understand. How could
we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1026
01:22:45,358 --> 01:22:47,918
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

1027
01:22:55,835 --> 01:22:59,737
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1028
01:22:59,806 --> 01:23:03,037
How do you like your choices?

1029
01:23:03,109 --> 01:23:06,237
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

1030
01:23:06,312 --> 01:23:09,483
All right, come on.

1031
01:23:09,616 --> 01:23:12,983
This is the oldest part
of Alcatraz.

1032
01:23:13,053 --> 01:23:15,920
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

1033
01:23:15,989 --> 01:23:18,958
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too...

1034
01:23:19,025 --> 01:23:22,392
and maybe when this is all over,
you and I can stop by
the souvenir shop together.

1035
01:23:22,462 --> 01:23:26,728
But right now I just... I just...
I wanna find some rockets.

1036
01:23:28,235 --> 01:23:32,831
Don't tempt me.
We are going to the morgue.

1037
01:23:56,396 --> 01:24:00,355
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1038
01:24:00,433 --> 01:24:02,128
Your best?

1039
01:24:02,202 --> 01:24:06,070
Losers always whine
about their best.

1040
01:24:06,139 --> 01:24:09,074
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1041
01:24:10,544 --> 01:24:12,478
Carla was the prom queen.

1042
01:24:12,546 --> 01:24:16,209
- Really?
- Yeah.

1043
01:24:17,784 --> 01:24:20,753
Locaters have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

1044
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:23,345
Come on, come on.
You can do it, Doc.

1045
01:24:31,164 --> 01:24:33,428
You must never hesitate.

1046
01:24:56,723 --> 01:24:59,988
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1047
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,994
Him, but not the rocket.

1048
01:25:02,062 --> 01:25:04,292
Any other news, Professor?

1049
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:09,833
Not the rocket!
Not the rocket.

1050
01:25:25,318 --> 01:25:27,684
I got a little somethin' for ya.

1051
01:25:49,976 --> 01:25:54,072
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1052
01:25:55,815 --> 01:25:57,783
Mason...

1053
01:25:59,786 --> 01:26:02,448
the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

1054
01:26:02,522 --> 01:26:04,615
Put it over there.

1055
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:18,065
You've been around a lot
of corpses. Is that normal?

1056
01:26:19,406 --> 01:26:21,397
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1057
01:26:21,474 --> 01:26:24,739
- Yeah, that happens.
- Well, I'm having kind of
a hard time concentrating.

1058
01:26:24,811 --> 01:26:28,770
- Can you do something about it?
- Well, like what? Kill him again?

1059
01:26:28,848 --> 01:26:31,783
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1060
01:26:31,851 --> 01:26:35,947
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1061
01:26:36,022 --> 01:26:40,220
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

1062
01:26:40,293 --> 01:26:42,989
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

1063
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:45,759
So what do you say you cut me
some friggin' slack?

1064
01:27:02,115 --> 01:27:04,083
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

1065
01:27:04,150 --> 01:27:06,914
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

1066
01:27:06,986 --> 01:27:09,113
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

1067
01:27:09,189 --> 01:27:12,283
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people.

1068
01:27:13,827 --> 01:27:18,264
Really? And what happens
if you drop one?

1069
01:27:18,331 --> 01:27:21,823
Happily, it'll just wipe out
you and me.

1070
01:27:21,901 --> 01:27:24,301
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1071
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:27,635
Stops the brain from
sending nerve messages down the
spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1072
01:27:27,707 --> 01:27:30,801
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

1073
01:27:30,877 --> 01:27:35,405
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1074
01:27:35,482 --> 01:27:37,347
Do not move that!

1075
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,016
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe.

1076
01:27:43,089 --> 01:27:46,354
You spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out.

1077
01:27:46,426 --> 01:27:49,224
But that's after
your skin melts off.

1078
01:27:49,295 --> 01:27:51,695
My God.

1079
01:27:51,765 --> 01:27:55,098
Oh, I think we'd like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?

1080
01:27:57,103 --> 01:28:00,504
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

1081
01:28:00,573 --> 01:28:02,564
so the rocket will splash down
after 500 feet.

1082
01:28:02,642 --> 01:28:04,769
All right, let me have that.

1083
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:08,940
You can let go of it. All right,
just back away. Just back away!

1084
01:28:09,015 --> 01:28:12,178
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

1085
01:28:14,988 --> 01:28:16,956
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird. Over.

1086
01:28:18,858 --> 01:28:21,850
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

1087
01:28:24,097 --> 01:28:27,624
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1088
01:28:27,700 --> 01:28:30,032
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

1089
01:28:30,103 --> 01:28:33,038
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

1090
01:28:33,106 --> 01:28:35,438
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1091
01:28:39,012 --> 01:28:41,003
Hold it.

1092
01:28:41,080 --> 01:28:43,947
Converge on the morgue.
Move out.

1093
01:28:45,051 --> 01:28:47,611
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1094
01:28:47,687 --> 01:28:50,986
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

1095
01:28:51,057 --> 01:28:52,786
Come on. Time's up.

1096
01:28:52,859 --> 01:28:54,986
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them.

1097
01:28:58,431 --> 01:29:00,160
Come on!

1098
01:29:19,452 --> 01:29:21,750
Clear!

1099
01:29:22,922 --> 01:29:24,822
I'm too old for this.

1100
01:29:24,891 --> 01:29:28,622
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

1101
01:29:28,695 --> 01:29:32,062
Sir, all the guidance chips
are gone.

1102
01:29:32,131 --> 01:29:34,292
Captain, I guess you didn't
quite take care of the rat problem.

1103
01:29:34,367 --> 01:29:36,392
- No, sir.
- Well, there are two dead men here...

1104
01:29:36,469 --> 01:29:39,996
- who strongly suggest
you go finish the job.
- Yes, sir.

1105
01:29:40,073 --> 01:29:43,133
Yes, sir!
Rio, Royce, let's go!

1106
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:45,234
Move out!

1107
01:29:50,183 --> 01:29:53,482
- You really don't know where this goes?
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1108
01:29:53,553 --> 01:29:55,817
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1109
01:29:55,889 --> 01:29:57,914
No, I don't.

1110
01:30:26,052 --> 01:30:28,247
God.

1111
01:30:36,396 --> 01:30:39,160
Mason, you all right?

1112
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:41,928
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot!

1113
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:46,861
- They're coming.
- Who?

1114
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:49,841
- The marines!
- Where?

1115
01:31:51,838 --> 01:31:55,171
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1116
01:32:01,147 --> 01:32:04,139
No! No! No!

1117
01:32:18,632 --> 01:32:20,725
Mason!

1118
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:25,704
Mason!

1119
01:33:41,081 --> 01:33:46,451
You motherfucker!
Die! Die! Die!

1120
01:34:06,606 --> 01:34:10,337
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1121
01:34:13,947 --> 01:34:17,314
How do you do it?

1122
01:34:18,985 --> 01:34:23,081
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1123
01:34:25,291 --> 01:34:27,156
Come on.

1124
01:34:27,227 --> 01:34:31,596
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1125
01:34:31,665 --> 01:34:33,367
Okay.

1126
01:34:37,503 --> 01:34:40,806
Okay, the president arrives
in three hours.

1127
01:34:40,939 --> 01:34:45,740
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1128
01:34:45,811 --> 01:34:49,110
- What's the word from Mohave, General?
- The same as last time, Lou.

1129
01:34:49,181 --> 01:34:51,877
They're going as fast as they can.

1130
01:34:56,688 --> 01:35:00,784
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

1131
01:35:10,802 --> 01:35:14,033
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got
something that belongs to me.

1132
01:35:14,105 --> 01:35:16,596
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

1133
01:35:16,675 --> 01:35:21,339
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

1134
01:35:21,413 --> 01:35:23,438
Speak up.

1135
01:35:23,515 --> 01:35:27,508
- Speak up!
- I, uh, uh...

1136
01:35:27,586 --> 01:35:30,453
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

1137
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:34,652
- Oh, man.
- And I'm a father of three.

1138
01:35:34,726 --> 01:35:38,059
And, uh, they've got a gun
to my head.

1139
01:35:38,129 --> 01:35:41,963
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips
to the exercise yard...

1140
01:35:42,033 --> 01:35:44,763
- or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.
- Oh, no.

1141
01:35:45,971 --> 01:35:48,565
Hey. Wha...

1142
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:50,972
Now, three to go.

1143
01:35:51,042 --> 01:35:54,136
You find them
and defuse them, okay?

1144
01:35:55,313 --> 01:35:56,905
- All right.
- All right.

1145
01:35:56,982 --> 01:36:00,611
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1146
01:36:00,685 --> 01:36:03,916
Hey, what about
Mr. Henderson's head?

1147
01:36:06,524 --> 01:36:09,493
Okay? What do you mean?

1148
01:36:15,133 --> 01:36:17,158
Okay.

1149
01:36:29,080 --> 01:36:32,607
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1150
01:36:34,486 --> 01:36:36,852
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

1151
01:36:51,102 --> 01:36:52,535
Bingo.

1152
01:37:01,613 --> 01:37:03,706
Stand easy.

1153
01:37:07,218 --> 01:37:10,381
Thought I'd been in the service
a long time.

1154
01:37:10,455 --> 01:37:14,755
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's army, actually.

1155
01:37:14,826 --> 01:37:20,230
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir."

1156
01:37:20,298 --> 01:37:23,426
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir...

1157
01:37:23,501 --> 01:37:27,437
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.
Retired, of course.

1158
01:37:31,343 --> 01:37:34,938
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

1159
01:37:35,013 --> 01:37:36,640
How the hell are you
involved in this?

1160
01:37:36,715 --> 01:37:39,183
Oh, I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1161
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:42,651
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

1162
01:37:57,035 --> 01:37:59,162
Hi, sweetie.

1163
01:38:06,411 --> 01:38:08,470
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1164
01:38:10,281 --> 01:38:12,875
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this?

1165
01:38:12,951 --> 01:38:15,283
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1166
01:38:15,353 --> 01:38:19,221
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1167
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:22,487
Then you wouldn't have any
fuckin' idea what it means
to lead some of the finest men...

1168
01:38:22,560 --> 01:38:25,961
on God's earth into battle,
and then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government.

1169
01:38:26,031 --> 01:38:29,228
I don't quite see how you cherish
the memory of the dead...

1170
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:32,064
by killing another million.

1171
01:38:32,137 --> 01:38:35,300
And, uh, this is not combat.

1172
01:38:35,373 --> 01:38:39,673
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

1173
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,474
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1174
01:38:48,586 --> 01:38:50,918
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

1175
01:38:50,989 --> 01:38:54,584
with the blood of patriots
and tyrants. " Thomas Jefferson.

1176
01:38:54,659 --> 01:38:59,653
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1177
01:39:05,203 --> 01:39:09,333
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

1178
01:39:09,407 --> 01:39:12,137
Where are the guidance chips?

1179
01:39:12,210 --> 01:39:16,374
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

1180
01:39:16,448 --> 01:39:18,473
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

1181
01:39:47,512 --> 01:39:50,106
You're lucky that old man Hummel
wants you alive.

1182
01:39:50,181 --> 01:39:52,206
'Cause I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

1183
01:39:59,056 --> 01:40:02,924
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you

1184
01:40:02,993 --> 01:40:04,585
Boy

1185
01:40:04,662 --> 01:40:08,359
"I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy."

1186
01:40:09,733 --> 01:40:11,598
What is wrong
with these people, huh, Mason?

1187
01:40:11,669 --> 01:40:15,833
Don't you think there's
a lot of, uh, a lot of anger
floatin' around this island?

1188
01:40:15,906 --> 01:40:19,137
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

1189
01:40:19,209 --> 01:40:23,509
A lot of angst, a lot of, " I'm 16,
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1190
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,605
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

1191
01:40:25,683 --> 01:40:28,948
with a bunch of
violence-for-pleasure-seeking
psychopathic marines.

1192
01:40:29,019 --> 01:40:31,681
Shame on them!

1193
01:40:34,058 --> 01:40:37,687
Anyway, I only got one chem round.
There's two left.

1194
01:40:37,761 --> 01:40:41,697
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

1195
01:40:41,765 --> 01:40:44,325
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

1196
01:40:44,401 --> 01:40:46,801
when the inmates weren't allowed
to talk in here.

1197
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:49,600
Not allowed to talk.

1198
01:40:49,673 --> 01:40:51,834
How'd you do it?

1199
01:40:51,909 --> 01:40:57,541
Uh, nurtured the hope
that there was hope.

1200
01:40:57,614 --> 01:41:00,276
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1201
01:41:00,351 --> 01:41:03,718
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1202
01:41:03,787 --> 01:41:08,690
Modest hopes, but, uh,
they kept a man alive.

1203
01:41:08,759 --> 01:41:11,922
What'd they put you
away for, John?

1204
01:41:11,996 --> 01:41:15,022
Oh, that's a long story.

1205
01:41:15,099 --> 01:41:18,034
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1206
01:41:18,102 --> 01:41:21,196
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1207
01:41:21,271 --> 01:41:22,966
Seven hours.

1208
01:41:25,509 --> 01:41:27,807
Thermite plasma is operational.

1209
01:41:27,878 --> 01:41:31,109
- Get me the president.
- Be seated.

1210
01:41:31,181 --> 01:41:35,345
Gentlemen, consider yourselves
on ground alert. If we receive
launch authority...

1211
01:41:35,419 --> 01:41:39,150
your mission is the complete thermal
destruction of Alcatraz Island.

1212
01:41:39,223 --> 01:41:42,681
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1213
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:45,593
Eighty-one American civilians
and a number of U.S. Marines...

1214
01:41:45,662 --> 01:41:48,028
will lose their lives
in this air strike.

1215
01:41:49,867 --> 01:41:52,461
Why didn't you just tell them
where the microfilm was...

1216
01:41:52,536 --> 01:41:55,437
and, and create a solution?

1217
01:41:55,506 --> 01:42:00,170
Hmph. The moment they had
the microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1218
01:42:00,244 --> 01:42:04,237
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

1219
01:42:04,314 --> 01:42:08,580
Which brings me to another question.
When you broke out...

1220
01:42:08,652 --> 01:42:13,214
Let me see if I can get this straight.
You went down the incinerator chute...

1221
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:17,727
on the mine cars, through
the tunnels to the power plant...

1222
01:42:17,795 --> 01:42:21,697
under the steam engine...
That was really cool, by the way...

1223
01:42:21,765 --> 01:42:24,325
and into the cistern
through the intake pipe.

1224
01:42:24,401 --> 01:42:29,930
But how, in the name
of Zeus's butthole...

1225
01:42:30,007 --> 01:42:32,840
did you get out
of your cell?

1226
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:35,708
I only ask because
in our current situation...

1227
01:42:35,779 --> 01:42:41,046
well, it could prove
to be useful information, maybe!

1228
01:42:59,269 --> 01:43:02,363
Trade secrets, my son.

1229
01:43:03,440 --> 01:43:04,873
Wow.

1230
01:43:04,975 --> 01:43:07,409
General,
two operational rockets left.

1231
01:43:07,478 --> 01:43:09,207
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

1232
01:43:09,279 --> 01:43:12,339
And both of the birds
are ready to fly, sir.

1233
01:43:12,416 --> 01:43:15,715
- G-General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.

1234
01:43:15,786 --> 01:43:18,380
Oh, just makin' sure.

1235
01:43:18,455 --> 01:43:23,085
Should we prepare
for launch, General?

1236
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:25,253
I'll handle the strategy, Captain.

1237
01:43:25,329 --> 01:43:28,924
Yes, sir.

1238
01:43:28,999 --> 01:43:32,901
The hour is approaching, sir.
Just letting the General know
of the time, sir.

1239
01:43:32,970 --> 01:43:36,872
- I'm very aware of the time, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1240
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:39,602
Me and my boys are ready to
cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1241
01:43:42,045 --> 01:43:43,979
Mason, where're you going?

1242
01:43:44,047 --> 01:43:46,572
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1243
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:52,088
You're not leaving! There's a madman in
there with his hand on a, on a button!

1244
01:43:52,156 --> 01:43:55,387
Shh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

1245
01:43:56,560 --> 01:43:59,620
Stop moving, Mason.

1246
01:43:59,696 --> 01:44:02,221
Mason, stop moving.

1247
01:44:02,299 --> 01:44:05,996
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1248
01:44:06,069 --> 01:44:09,630
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

1249
01:44:09,706 --> 01:44:12,038
Oh, well, then,
everything's just fine!

1250
01:44:12,109 --> 01:44:14,942
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1251
01:44:16,079 --> 01:44:19,276
Three minutes to go, sir.

1252
01:44:19,349 --> 01:44:22,546
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

1253
01:44:22,619 --> 01:44:25,679
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

1254
01:44:25,756 --> 01:44:28,782
Sir.

1255
01:44:33,697 --> 01:44:36,393
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.

1256
01:44:36,466 --> 01:44:39,162
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's goin'?

1257
01:44:39,236 --> 01:44:42,399
- Listen, on this end we're gonna
need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.

1258
01:44:42,472 --> 01:44:45,441
Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get final
authorization from the president.

1259
01:44:45,509 --> 01:44:47,636
You've got three minutes.

1260
01:44:47,711 --> 01:44:50,043
Frank, please don't do
anything stupid.

1261
01:44:52,649 --> 01:44:54,617
They want another hour.

1262
01:44:54,685 --> 01:44:58,052
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1263
01:44:58,121 --> 01:45:00,214
They're calling our bluff, sir.

1264
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:04,158
They're playing you
for a fool, sir.

1265
01:45:04,228 --> 01:45:07,493
Order the launch, General.

1266
01:45:07,564 --> 01:45:11,159
Come on, General.
Let's be all we can be.

1267
01:45:25,515 --> 01:45:27,642
The mission's not complete!

1268
01:45:27,718 --> 01:45:29,652
Well, mine is.

1269
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:32,553
When this is over,
you'll go back home...

1270
01:45:32,623 --> 01:45:37,651
driving Carla and your baby insane
in your beige Volvo.

1271
01:45:37,728 --> 01:45:41,391
And I'll be dead or back in prison,
which is the same thing.

1272
01:45:41,465 --> 01:45:43,592
You're not leaving.

1273
01:45:48,005 --> 01:45:52,101
All right, I'll do it myself.

1274
01:45:53,577 --> 01:45:55,704
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

1275
01:45:55,779 --> 01:45:59,715
I'll kick the... Out of
a platoon full of marines.

1276
01:45:59,783 --> 01:46:02,616
No problem.

1277
01:46:14,398 --> 01:46:17,333
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

1278
01:46:17,401 --> 01:46:20,893
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1279
01:46:21,605 --> 01:46:23,368
Let's go!

1280
01:46:28,679 --> 01:46:30,977
Laser powered up!

1281
01:46:31,048 --> 01:46:36,315
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

1282
01:46:36,386 --> 01:46:41,050
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. I'm a
chemical weapons specialist for the FBI.

1283
01:46:41,124 --> 01:46:43,115
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1284
01:46:43,193 --> 01:46:45,821
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

1285
01:46:45,896 --> 01:46:48,626
Because if the winds change
after you launch those rockets...

1286
01:46:48,699 --> 01:46:50,724
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

1287
01:46:50,801 --> 01:46:54,862
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1288
01:46:54,938 --> 01:46:58,305
So, what do you say you do the math,
h-hand over the gun...

1289
01:46:58,375 --> 01:47:01,811
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck...

1290
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:13,318
- You made the right choice.
- I decided I didn't want your child...

1291
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:16,223
growing up without a father.

1292
01:47:16,293 --> 01:47:19,194
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

1293
01:47:19,262 --> 01:47:22,322
So, I'm fucked either way.
So, come on.

1294
01:47:22,399 --> 01:47:25,300
Weapon is hot. I am standing by
for the launch command.

1295
01:47:25,369 --> 01:47:28,133
Man, killing Navy SEALs
is one thing...

1296
01:47:28,205 --> 01:47:31,663
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

1297
01:47:34,411 --> 01:47:36,879
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1298
01:47:36,947 --> 01:47:39,916
Launch coordinates: Six, seven,

1299
01:47:39,983 --> 01:47:43,180
five, four, five, niner.

1300
01:47:45,622 --> 01:47:49,752
The weapon is hot.
I'm standing by for launch command.

1301
01:47:49,826 --> 01:47:51,851
That's affirmative.

1302
01:47:58,535 --> 01:48:01,026
Standing by for command.

1303
01:48:08,979 --> 01:48:11,573
I'm waiting for
launch command, General.

1304
01:48:20,256 --> 01:48:22,588
- Fire.
- Fire!

1305
01:48:27,563 --> 01:48:29,861
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1306
01:48:35,371 --> 01:48:39,967
Origin:
Alcatraz, 67253725.

1307
01:48:40,042 --> 01:48:44,103
- What's the goddamn heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1308
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:48,480
- Speed?
- Three hundred knots.
It's headed right at Oakland.

1309
01:48:48,551 --> 01:48:51,019
Football game.

1310
01:48:53,355 --> 01:48:55,186
Oh, my God.

1311
01:49:18,113 --> 01:49:21,207
Missile radically
changing direction.

1312
01:49:26,288 --> 01:49:30,725
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1313
01:49:32,127 --> 01:49:34,459
Oh, Christ!

1314
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:36,930
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

1315
01:49:38,534 --> 01:49:41,970
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1316
01:49:45,174 --> 01:49:48,075
Bogey detonated
under water.

1317
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,508
What the fuck?

1318
01:49:52,648 --> 01:49:55,014
It missed.

1319
01:49:55,084 --> 01:49:57,245
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

1320
01:49:57,319 --> 01:49:59,617
But there's still one left.

1321
01:49:59,688 --> 01:50:03,385
What happened to the rocket? What
the fuck happened to the coordinates?

1322
01:50:03,459 --> 01:50:07,020
What the fuck is going on?
Sir! Major!

1323
01:50:07,096 --> 01:50:10,088
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

1324
01:50:10,165 --> 01:50:12,156
Captain, step outside!

1325
01:50:25,614 --> 01:50:27,878
Get me the Pentagon.

1326
01:50:41,930 --> 01:50:44,865
What the hell was that, Frank?

1327
01:50:44,933 --> 01:50:48,096
- I said, what the hell...
- I heard what you said!
If you're gonna be insubordinate...

1328
01:50:48,170 --> 01:50:51,731
- I'd appreciate it if you'd do
it with a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1329
01:50:51,807 --> 01:50:53,741
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1330
01:50:53,809 --> 01:50:55,868
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

1331
01:50:55,944 --> 01:50:59,038
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1332
01:50:59,114 --> 01:51:02,242
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

1333
01:51:02,318 --> 01:51:05,287
- We're askin' 'em.
We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1334
01:51:05,354 --> 01:51:07,254
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are marines!

1335
01:51:07,323 --> 01:51:10,952
Are they?

1336
01:51:11,026 --> 01:51:13,688
- I wanna talk to General Kramer.
- You've been asked by an old friend.

1337
01:51:13,762 --> 01:51:16,322
- Put him on the phone right now.
- You've been ordered
by a superior officer.

1338
01:51:16,398 --> 01:51:19,390
- This is Major Baxter.
- Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

1339
01:51:19,468 --> 01:51:21,936
Put the phone down.

1340
01:51:25,708 --> 01:51:28,438
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

1341
01:51:29,978 --> 01:51:31,912
At ease.

1342
01:51:40,422 --> 01:51:43,050
They need a decision,
Mr. President.

1343
01:51:52,101 --> 01:51:54,661
These past few hours...

1344
01:51:54,737 --> 01:51:58,571
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

1345
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:02,804
How does one weigh human life?

1346
01:52:02,878 --> 01:52:06,405
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

1347
01:52:07,649 --> 01:52:10,117
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1348
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,082
That we have ignored,
abandoned or marginalized...

1349
01:52:16,158 --> 01:52:18,626
a great soldier like Frank Hummel...

1350
01:52:18,694 --> 01:52:23,631
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect in blood...

1351
01:52:23,699 --> 01:52:27,931
is equally real
and equally tragic.

1352
01:52:30,806 --> 01:52:33,900
We are at war with terror.

1353
01:52:33,976 --> 01:52:36,274
Fighting a war means casualties.

1354
01:52:36,345 --> 01:52:39,803
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1355
01:52:44,052 --> 01:52:46,543
Air strike approved.

1356
01:52:49,691 --> 01:52:51,682
Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.

1357
01:52:53,195 --> 01:52:55,425
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there...

1358
01:52:55,497 --> 01:52:58,864
- Tower this is Strike Leader.
Prepared to go.
- It'll be over in a few seconds.

1359
01:52:58,934 --> 01:53:01,336
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1360
01:53:07,809 --> 01:53:12,610
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you,
but what the fuck is going on?

1361
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:15,911
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?
- That's affirmative, Captain.

1362
01:53:15,983 --> 01:53:20,010
So, now they think we're
gutless, the Feds? They think
we won't actually do it.

1363
01:53:20,088 --> 01:53:22,989
They're gonna come at us with everything
they've got. Air and sea.

1364
01:53:23,057 --> 01:53:27,255
- They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.
- They don't know we missed on purpose.

1365
01:53:27,328 --> 01:53:33,062
Great. We're not gutless,
we're incompetent. That right?

1366
01:53:33,134 --> 01:53:37,002
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1367
01:53:37,071 --> 01:53:39,631
Load the V.X. Into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1368
01:53:39,707 --> 01:53:41,675
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

1369
01:53:41,743 --> 01:53:45,270
Excuse me, General,
but what about the fucking money?

1370
01:53:45,346 --> 01:53:47,837
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1371
01:53:47,915 --> 01:53:49,712
Bullshit it's over.

1372
01:53:49,784 --> 01:53:53,379
You're talking to a General, soldier.
Maintain discipline.

1373
01:53:53,454 --> 01:53:55,513
I'm not a soldier, Major.

1374
01:53:55,590 --> 01:54:00,323
The day we took hostages we became
mercenaries. And mercenaries get paid!

1375
01:54:00,395 --> 01:54:03,023
I want my fucking money!

1376
01:54:03,097 --> 01:54:06,863
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1377
01:54:06,934 --> 01:54:10,995
I'm not about to kill 80,000
innocent people. Do you think
I'm out of my fucking mind?

1378
01:54:13,541 --> 01:54:16,066
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1379
01:54:20,515 --> 01:54:23,109
Whoever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1380
01:54:23,184 --> 01:54:25,118
Stand down, Captain.

1381
01:54:29,724 --> 01:54:32,022
Stand down, Captain!

1382
01:54:37,999 --> 01:54:40,900
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1383
01:54:43,871 --> 01:54:48,001
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

1384
01:54:48,075 --> 01:54:50,543
Sergeant Crisp...

1385
01:54:50,611 --> 01:54:53,444
secure the General.

1386
01:54:53,514 --> 01:54:55,880
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1387
01:55:00,388 --> 01:55:02,447
Sergeant!

1388
01:55:09,397 --> 01:55:12,798
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1389
01:55:20,975 --> 01:55:24,467
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

1390
01:55:30,117 --> 01:55:33,211
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General.

1391
01:55:38,259 --> 01:55:41,057
But like he said...

1392
01:55:42,396 --> 01:55:45,024
it's over.

1393
01:56:00,948 --> 01:56:03,109
Let's get him.

1394
01:56:08,155 --> 01:56:10,851
Mason!

1395
01:56:13,461 --> 01:56:17,420
- My God, what have I done?
- Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

1396
01:56:20,468 --> 01:56:23,437
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1397
01:56:23,504 --> 01:56:26,234
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

1398
01:56:39,420 --> 01:56:42,355
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

1399
01:56:48,629 --> 01:56:52,895
One, two, three! Eat that!

1400
01:57:07,248 --> 01:57:08,738
Did it.

1401
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:44,274
Come here. Come here,
you little chicken shit!

1402
01:57:44,352 --> 01:57:47,651
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1403
01:57:47,722 --> 01:57:49,986
Well, come on. Come on.
Don't be scared. I won't hurt ya.

1404
01:57:50,057 --> 01:57:52,252
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

1405
01:57:52,326 --> 01:57:54,521
You know how this shit works?

1406
01:57:58,499 --> 01:58:00,626
Come on. Come on.

1407
01:58:00,701 --> 01:58:02,794
I don't need the gun.
I'll put it down.

1408
01:58:02,870 --> 01:58:07,239
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1409
01:58:07,308 --> 01:58:12,007
Listen, I think we got
started off on the wrong foot.
Stan Goodspeed, FBI. Uh...

1410
01:58:12,079 --> 01:58:15,310
Let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1411
01:58:15,383 --> 01:58:17,476
I don't like soft-ass shit.

1412
01:58:17,551 --> 01:58:19,712
Oh, you... Oh, oh. Oh.

1413
01:58:19,787 --> 01:58:23,780
Well, I only bring it up
because, uh, it's you.

1414
01:58:23,858 --> 01:58:26,418
You're the Rocket Man.

1415
01:58:28,062 --> 01:58:29,927
No!

1416
01:58:31,932 --> 01:58:36,130
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

1417
01:58:43,944 --> 01:58:46,037
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1418
01:58:47,348 --> 01:58:49,782
Shit!

1419
01:59:09,770 --> 01:59:11,931
Darrow!

1420
01:59:12,006 --> 01:59:14,065
Open up!

1421
01:59:16,844 --> 01:59:18,539
Come on.

1422
01:59:18,612 --> 01:59:20,341
Open up!

1423
01:59:49,076 --> 01:59:51,909
Hey, you mother!

1424
02:00:25,412 --> 02:00:28,006
Oh, I'm gonna get you now, baby.

1425
02:00:31,552 --> 02:00:34,180
Okay.

1426
02:00:36,257 --> 02:00:37,952
I got ya. I got you, baby.

1427
02:00:39,293 --> 02:00:41,557
Come on.

1428
02:00:57,645 --> 02:00:59,010
Fucker!

1429
02:01:25,640 --> 02:01:27,699
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

1430
02:01:27,775 --> 02:01:30,175
Time on target: Seven minutes.

1431
02:01:47,428 --> 02:01:50,397
English prick.
I tell you my old man was Irish?

1432
02:01:53,268 --> 02:01:56,032
Maintain air speed 450 knots.

1433
02:02:02,243 --> 02:02:04,404
Fuck!

1434
02:02:22,730 --> 02:02:24,823
It's me and you, pal.

1435
02:02:24,899 --> 02:02:27,367
I want that fucking chip!

1436
02:02:37,579 --> 02:02:39,672
I love pressure.

1437
02:02:46,888 --> 02:02:49,880
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1438
02:02:49,958 --> 02:02:52,392
Now, pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1439
02:03:21,923 --> 02:03:24,357
Increase speed
to 500 knots.

1440
02:03:24,425 --> 02:03:27,189
You motherfucker! Die!

1441
02:03:31,899 --> 02:03:35,892
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

1442
02:03:35,970 --> 02:03:38,871
Eat that, you fuck!

1443
02:04:07,235 --> 02:04:09,726
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1444
02:04:14,742 --> 02:04:18,769
Come to course heading
142 degrees.

1445
02:04:26,454 --> 02:04:28,615
When he neutralizes the threat...

1446
02:04:28,690 --> 02:04:31,853
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1447
02:04:36,531 --> 02:04:40,262
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1448
02:04:40,335 --> 02:04:43,532
Please don't let this happen. There has
to be something you can do. Please.

1449
02:04:54,182 --> 02:04:57,242
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

1450
02:05:07,328 --> 02:05:09,762
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1451
02:05:13,134 --> 02:05:17,093
This is Red Thunder.
Master armed. Master armed.

1452
02:05:18,373 --> 02:05:20,933
Time on target: 12 seconds.

1453
02:05:23,411 --> 02:05:26,574
T.O. T: Ten seconds.

1454
02:05:30,651 --> 02:05:32,585
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1455
02:05:35,390 --> 02:05:37,324
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1456
02:05:37,392 --> 02:05:40,725
This is C.Q. One, C.Q. One!
Green smoke! We have green smoke! Over.

1457
02:05:40,795 --> 02:05:43,025
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

1458
02:05:43,097 --> 02:05:45,861
- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
- Jesus Chri...

1459
02:05:48,069 --> 02:05:50,765
I already dropped them!

1460
02:05:59,747 --> 02:06:03,774
- Oh, goddamn it!
- Oh, my God!

1461
02:06:06,454 --> 02:06:09,480
Get out of my way. Let me through,
please. Let me through!

1462
02:06:13,861 --> 02:06:17,820
The cells did not get hit. The bombs
hit on the back of the island.

1463
02:06:40,655 --> 02:06:45,820
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1464
02:06:45,893 --> 02:06:49,920
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1465
02:06:49,997 --> 02:06:55,367
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.
Spend all my money on shrinks.

1466
02:06:56,504 --> 02:06:58,529
Goodspeed, come in.

1467
02:06:58,606 --> 02:07:01,803
Goodspeed, Goodspeed,
do you read me? Come in!

1468
02:07:01,876 --> 02:07:05,403
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1469
02:07:07,582 --> 02:07:10,380
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1470
02:07:15,590 --> 02:07:19,287
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1471
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,090
This is Goodspeed.

1472
02:07:23,731 --> 02:07:28,134
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of 'em.

1473
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:33,734
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

1474
02:07:33,808 --> 02:07:36,572
What about Mason?

1475
02:07:43,718 --> 02:07:46,084
- He's dead, sir.
- How? When?

1476
02:07:46,153 --> 02:07:48,815
Just come and get me.

1477
02:07:51,292 --> 02:07:54,489
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1478
02:07:54,562 --> 02:07:57,326
But, of course.
I knew he would.

1479
02:07:57,398 --> 02:08:00,561
The S.D.U. S and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1480
02:08:00,635 --> 02:08:05,402
If you can get to the
Pan Pacific Hotel, there's clothes
in my closet, $200 in the Bible.

1481
02:08:05,473 --> 02:08:08,033
Room 26.

1482
02:08:08,109 --> 02:08:12,569
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1483
02:08:14,482 --> 02:08:17,747
But thank you.

1484
02:08:17,818 --> 02:08:23,688
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when
we go our separate ways, huh?

1485
02:08:23,758 --> 02:08:28,320
But, uh, I'm sure you know
the etymology of your name "Goodspeed."

1486
02:08:28,396 --> 02:08:32,594
Yeah, Godspeed: To wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1487
02:08:32,667 --> 02:08:36,433
Well, if you fancy a journey...

1488
02:08:36,504 --> 02:08:39,632
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1489
02:08:40,408 --> 02:08:42,672
I was thinking of Maui.

1490
02:08:42,743 --> 02:08:45,007
No.

1491
02:08:48,549 --> 02:08:51,541
Forget Maui.

1492
02:08:56,891 --> 02:09:01,089
"St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1493
02:09:01,162 --> 02:09:03,494
"Front pew, right leg.

1494
02:09:03,564 --> 02:09:06,431
Hollow."

1495
02:09:06,500 --> 02:09:09,230
Is this what I think it is?

1496
02:09:10,805 --> 02:09:13,831
Mason?

1497
02:09:27,221 --> 02:09:30,418
- Congratulations, Dr. Goodspeed.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.

1498
02:09:30,491 --> 02:09:33,358
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1499
02:09:33,427 --> 02:09:35,827
Well done, son.

1500
02:09:35,896 --> 02:09:37,557
So, where's Mason?

1501
02:09:37,632 --> 02:09:41,762
Vaporized. Blown out to sea.

1502
02:09:41,836 --> 02:09:44,202
Blown out to sea, huh?

1503
02:09:44,271 --> 02:09:46,739
Yeah.

1504
02:09:47,541 --> 02:09:51,875
Poor bastard.

1505
02:09:51,946 --> 02:09:56,940
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his
body? I wanna see that son of a bitch!

1506
02:09:57,018 --> 02:10:00,681
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1507
02:10:00,755 --> 02:10:05,385
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1508
02:10:05,459 --> 02:10:08,622
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely, sir.

1509
02:10:11,432 --> 02:10:15,562
St. Michael's Church,
front pew, right leg.

1510
02:10:15,636 --> 02:10:17,570
Front pew, right leg.

1511
02:10:17,638 --> 02:10:19,697
Vandals! Vandals!

1512
02:10:19,774 --> 02:10:22,038
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1513
02:10:22,109 --> 02:10:25,943
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

1514
02:10:26,013 --> 02:10:28,914
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

1515
02:10:28,983 --> 02:10:32,282
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

1516
02:10:33,988 --> 02:10:35,615
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1517
02:10:37,625 --> 02:10:40,526
Vandals! Vandals!

1518
02:10:40,594 --> 02:10:45,651
Honey, uh, you wanna know
who really killed J.F. K?
