<i>We can't hold out much longer, sir!</i>

2
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,920
<i>General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!</i>

3
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,640
<i>I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.</i>

4
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,840
<i>Goddam it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost 15 men already!</i>

5
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
<i>Sir, they're lightin'us up
like a firestorm!</i>

6
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,920
<i>This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!</i>

7
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,560
<i>We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.</i>

8
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,400
<i>They're not coming for us,
are they, sir?</i>

9
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,000
<i>Congressman Weaver
and esteemed members of the
Special Armed Services Committee,</i>

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,760
<i>I come before you to protest
a grave injustice.</i>

11
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,800
Aim!

12
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,160
<i>It has to stop.</i>

13
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,680
I miss you so much.

14
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:17,680
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

15
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,600
Something I couldn't do
while you were here.

16
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:25,640
I tried.
You know I tried everything.

17
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,960
And I still don't have
their attention.

18
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,920
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

19
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,440
But whatever happens,

20
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,040
please don't think less
of me.

21
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,680
Marine,
inform the garrison C. O...

22
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,600
that General Hummel's coming on board
with a security inspection team.

23
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,440
Yes, sir. Sir, it's an honour
having you, sir.

24
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,280
Ya know, at least
we can get some...

25
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,400
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

26
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,760
I got the access card. We've got
30 minutes till those darts wear off.

27
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,960
Move it!

28
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,680
The access card, sir.

29
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,280
Let's do it.

30
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,440
Twenty-four hundred
magazine check.

31
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,640
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

32
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,000
Clear!

33
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,240
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

34
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,120
Evac!
Seal the door!

35
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
- No!
- Come on, man!
- No!
- Seal it!

36
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,280
- No!
- Seal it!
- Help!

37
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,920
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

38
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,120
Let me out! Let me out!

39
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,280
Clear out.
Get outta here!

40
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,960
Sorry.

41
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,640
Let's move out.

42
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,440
Two more cc's
of acetylene chloride.

43
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,640
- That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.
- You suck.

44
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,200
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

45
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,240
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

46
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,640
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

47
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,840
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

48
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,280
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $ 13 on a CD, man?

49
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,520
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

50
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,040
And second,
these sound better.

51
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:47,200
Could be serious.
Could be sarin gas.

52
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,400
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

53
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,400
postmarked to
a Bosnian refugee camp.

54
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:56,840
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

55
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,280
Bosnian refugee camp?

56
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,760
Half a million Serbians reside
in the U.S., Marvin.
Serbians don't like Bosnians.

57
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,040
You guys wanna get
suited up?

58
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,800
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

59
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,920
<i>We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.</i>

60
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,720
October 1, 0900 hours.

61
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,520
<i>Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood...</i>

62
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,840
<i>initiating exam

63
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,400
<i>Suspicion of
sarin gas inside.</i>

64
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,960
<i>- Marvin, sarin is a...
- G.B. Aerosol.</i>

65
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,800
<i>That is correct.</i>

66
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,120
Now, let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

67
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,120
<i>Stone Age Cave Girls
in the Raw. Kinky.</i>

68
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,400
And, uh...
Not a good sign.

69
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,640
Hello, little baby doll.

70
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
Lookit, Stan.

71
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,960
- Hi there,
- Marvin!
- Stanley.
- Marvin, don't!

72
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,080
- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!

73
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,200
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

74
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,640
We'll have that room clear
in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

75
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,720
Jesus Christ!

76
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,800
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

77
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:14,320
The bad news is that the gas
is corrosive and it's eating our suits.

78
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,520
<i>- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news...</i>

79
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,320
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

80
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,480
<i>- and kill everybody in the building.
- Detonation too heavy.
- Everybody, out of the room now!</i>

81
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,000
Seal us inside.

82
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,960
<i>- Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?
- The acid's eating my su...</i>

83
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,520
<i>It's eating my fucking suit!
All right? Shit!</i>

84
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,800
- Just wash us off!
- Where are my sprinklers?

85
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
We're working on it. It's coming.
It's just a flow problem.

86
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,840
Well, that's a pretty big
friggin' problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

87
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:49,120
- We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?
- A minute ten.

88
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,400
- Look at this!
- We're gonna have the room clear.

89
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,560
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!
- The atropine, Isherwood.

90
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,360
<i>- What?
- Where's my water, Lonner? One minute!</i>

91
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:01,800
- Marvin, the atropine, now!
- Inject it in your heart
before your suit melts.

92
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,360
Shit!

93
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,280
Make him take his dose.

94
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,760
- Where's that water?
- Get that away from me!

95
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,400
Come on, Phil, fix it
for Christ's sake!

96
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,360
- Take the atropine now, Stan,
for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

97
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,920
The poison's mixing.

98
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,840
What the fuck are you
waiting for, Stanley?
You take the fucking needle now!

99
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,560
- Fuck! Shit! Oh, fuck, shit!
- Forty seconds!

100
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,120
If that suit melts...
If you die, we all die!

101
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,720
Inject your heart
and then diffuse the bomb!

102
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:35,000
- Come on, just do it, Stan!
- Shit! What if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

103
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,040
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is.
You want me to stick this into my heart?

104
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,600
- Are you fucking nuts?
- The sprinkler's coming! It's coming!

105
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,840
Okay, here we go, man!

106
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,560
Sprinkler activated.

107
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,600
How much time left?

108
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,840
<i>Twenty seconds!</i>

109
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,040
We're not gonna make it.

110
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
Fifteen.

111
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,120
Oh, come on.

112
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,480
Clear!

113
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,040
<i>Get me the fuck
out of this gas chamber!</i>

114
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,080
<i>I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing.</i>

115
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,160
<i>Please lock me away</i>

116
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,640
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

117
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,320
Hi, baby.

118
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,520
<i>Here inside where I hide
with my loneliness</i>

119
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,160
I had such
an interesting day today.

120
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,600
Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

121
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,040
Oh, okay, you go first.

122
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:41,480
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send
a little care package, box of goodies,

123
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,680
which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

124
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,400
So I took
the rest of the day off.

125
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,600
Glass of wine, little guitar.
Just relaxing.

126
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,160
- Wow!
- I mean it, honey. The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

127
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,320
I really believe that anyone
who's even thinking about
having a child in this world...

128
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,960
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

129
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,920
I know, I'm rambling,
I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

130
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,320
- What's your news, baby?
- I'm pregnant.

131
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,720
I'm sorry?

132
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:15,720
I'm pregnant.

133
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,440
- Really?
- Yeah.

134
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,520
- Wow!
- Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

135
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,080
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

136
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,440
How do you know? I mean,
h-how do you know?

137
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,200
Blue! Just turned blue
so I went to the doctor.

138
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
- Well, you didn't mean what
you just said, did you?
- When?

139
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,480
Uh, just right now when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

140
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,480
and having it be
an act of cruelty.

141
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,560
- I meant it at the time.
- Stanley, at the time? You said it
seven and a half seconds ago.

142
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,040
Well, gosh!

143
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,440
Kind of a lot's happened since then.
Look, we're not even married.

144
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,640
- I know. It's funny
you should mention that.
- It's funny?

145
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,800
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.

146
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,000
Good.

147
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:11,600
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa! Whoa! Wai...
Hey, Marriage Police, pull over!

148
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:14,640
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

149
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,320
The Rock is the most famous and was
the most feared prison ever built.

150
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,920
Is it really true that
there's never been an escape?

151
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,200
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until
'63 when the prison closed,

152
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,120
there were 14 attempts.

153
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,880
No one is believed to have made
it to shore, alive at least.

154
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,120
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

155
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,680
- I don't really give a shit!
Do you give a shit?
- No.

156
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,240
- Come here, fruity.
- Move!

157
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,200
- Hey, girls? Hi.
You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

158
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,160
Will you do something for me?
It's really, it's really important.

159
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,320
I need you to tell your teacher
that you need to get back on
the boat and go home right now.

160
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,600
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

161
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,680
This cell block housed...

162
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,360
the most awesome scum
in America.

163
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,080
Ladies and gentlemen,
I, Ranger Bob,

164
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,880
cordially invite you to become inmates
of Alcatraz, temporarily, of course.

165
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,960
On the line!

166
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,560
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

167
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,000
Like being a caged animal.

168
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
Spend a couple of years
in there...

169
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,000
- What's the matter, fellas?
Something wrong with the tour?
- The tour's over, Bob.

170
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,560
What kind of fucked-up tour
is this?

171
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,280
General Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

172
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,160
Welcome to the Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the
back side and deploy as planned.

173
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,640
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

174
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,720
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun.

175
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,560
Oh, you're not allowed to carry
a gun? I got a goddam gun.

176
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,400
If I'd've known this was
gonna happen, I'd have brought
my motherfuckin' gun! Help!

177
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:24,960
All right, gentlemen, this'll be
our new home. Tom, I want
my command centre right here.

178
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,200
- I want Coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

179
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:39,680
Put the satellite over there.
I wanna be up at 1600.

180
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,760
Let's move it.

181
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:55,360
- Systems up.
- Possible penetration point
in the shower room.

182
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,800
- We're setting anti-intrusion.
- I brought a personal touch, sir.

183
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:02,920
It's an anti-motion trembler
device. It's custom-made.

184
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:05,640
Nobody knows about it
and nobody expects it.

185
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:09,120
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

186
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,200
And then if they disturb
Mr Backup here, we own 'em.

187
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,480
Ladies and gentlemen,
you're being detained against your will.

188
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,560
For that, I apologize.

189
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,040
It is not our intention
in any way to harm you.

190
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,520
You will not be detained one
minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

191
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,400
Attention on deck!

192
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:51,200
Stand easy, men.

193
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:56,080
Make no mistake about it,
gentlemen, we are now in harm's way.

194
00:17:56,200 --> 00:18:00,440
For Major Baxter and I,
this is the last campaign in
a career datin' back to Tet '68.

195
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,800
Likewise for Captain Hendrix,
Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

196
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:08,680
who cut their teeth under
my command in Desert Storm.

197
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,360
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow,
this is my first operational
situation with you and your men.

198
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,160
And I have to say, thus far your conduct
reflects your reputations.

199
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,240
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

200
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,800
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

201
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,960
To this
we must now add resolve.

202
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,520
We'll be branded as traitors,
the gravest capital crime.

203
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,760
Punishable by death.

204
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,120
A couple hundred years ago,

205
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
a few guys named Washington,
Jefferson and Adams...

206
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
were branded as traitors
by the British.

207
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,040
And now
they're called patriots.

208
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
In time, so shall we.

209
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,240
God willing,
in less than 48 hours...

210
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:52,680
you will evacuate this island
in gunships under cover of
hostages and V.X. Gas warheads.

211
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,200
Your destination: A
non-extradition treaty country.

212
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,880
You will each be paid a fee
of $ 1 million for services rendered.

213
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,760
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

214
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,680
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

215
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,560
The men of
Marine Force Recon...

216
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,280
are selected to carry out
illegal operations throughout the world.

217
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,800
When they don't come home,

218
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,600
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

219
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,920
and denied compensation.

220
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,400
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career!

221
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:31,040
Well, here and now
the lies stop!

222
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,640
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

223
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,920
This is FBI Director Womack.

224
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:50,600
Director, be advised.

225
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,440
Eighty-one,
I say again,

226
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,360
81 civilians are under
my control as of this moment.

227
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,720
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

228
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,200
Who is this?

229
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,040
Mr Director, you have
a very serious problem.

230
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,880
A battery of V.X. Gas rockets
is presently deployed...

231
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,240
to deliver a highly
lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

232
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,720
- I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.
- I want to know who I'm talking to.

233
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,960
This is Brigadier General
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

234
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,800
Out!

235
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,520
- I'll cancel your reservations.
- Get the Pentagon.

236
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,320
And call the San Francisco office.
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

237
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,480
<i>Last night General Hummel,
using brutal but nonlethal force...</i>

238
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,680
under the guise of a security
exercise, walked off with 15
V.X. Poison gas rockets.

239
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,920
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

240
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:48,760
That's General Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

241
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:53,040
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

242
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,000
Three Purple Hearts,
two Silver Stars...

243
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,840
and the Congressional Medal of...

244
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,120
Jesus!
This man is a hero!

245
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,760
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr Sinclair.

246
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,280
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

247
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,800
Mr Sinclair, General Hummel
is a man of honour.

248
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,120
General, it's him.

249
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,200
Frank, it's Al Kramer.

250
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,160
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

251
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,560
<i>I don't know, Frank.
Ah, why don't you tell me.</i>

252
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,480
Got a lot of very, very
worried people here, Frank.

253
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,560
I'll come straight
to the point.

254
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,040
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

255
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,520
Forty-seven in northern Laos
and southern China.

256
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,800
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

257
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,120
<i>Who is this?
Identify yourself.</i>

258
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,160
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

259
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,960
- How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?
- I'm 33.

260
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,280
<i>Well, Mr Sinclair, you've probably got
no fucking idea what I'm talking about.</i>

261
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,720
<i>By your ninth birthday, I was
runnin'black ops into China,</i>

262
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,800
<i>and my men were responsible
f- for over 200 enemy kills.</i>

263
00:21:55,920 --> 00:22:00,760
<i>Al, put some rigging tape over Mr
Sinclair's mouth. He's wasting my time.</i>

264
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,360
Ah, you want to continue,
Frank?

265
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,600
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

266
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,480
Those surgical hits made by our
smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

267
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,240
<i>It was my men on the ground
that made those hits possible
by lasing the targets.</i>

268
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,800
<i>Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.</i>

269
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,440
No benefits were paid
to their families.

270
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,920
<i>No medals conferred.</i>

271
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,920
<i>These men died for their
country, and they weren't even
given a goddam military burial.</i>

272
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,600
<i>The situation is unacceptable.
You will transfer $ 100 million...</i>

273
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,520
<i>from the Grand Cayman Red Sea
Trading Company account
to an account I designate.</i>

274
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,360
<i>From these funds, reparations
of $ 1 million will be paid...</i>

275
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,000
<i>to each of
the 83 Marines'families.</i>

276
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,480
<i>The rest of the funds I will
disperse at my discretion.</i>

277
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,120
Do I make myself clear?

278
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:52,320
Except for the Red Sea
Trading Company. What is that?

279
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,400
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

280
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,120
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

281
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,760
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

282
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,560
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

283
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,360
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

284
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,360
<i>You've got 40 hours, till noon
day after tomorrow to arrange
transfer of the money.</i>

285
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,360
<i>I am aware of your
countermeasure. You know and I
know it doesn't stand a chance.</i>

286
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,280
<i>Hummel from Alcatraz.
Out.</i>

287
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:25,200
All right. We have to identify
the hostages and contact each
of their families.

288
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,240
Uh, tell 'em somethin'.
Make up a story, and we've got
to keep this undercover.

289
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:33,520
If this comes out, the city
of San Francisco will be
in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

290
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

291
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:42,480
for a single rocket armed with
V.X. Poison gas, General Peterson?

292
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,640
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's, that's not so bad.

293
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,600
- Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!
- Oh.

294
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,360
One teaspoon of this hits the floor,
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

295
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,280
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

296
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,320
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

297
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
Get the point?

298
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,360
Uh, what did Hummel mean
by your countermeasure, General?

299
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:11,640
Standard poison is countered
by napalm. It burns it up,
consumes it upon detonation.

300
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,080
Now, the problem
with V.X. Poison gas is...

301
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,600
that it's designed specifically
to withstand napalm.

302
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,160
That's where, uh, thermite plasma
comes in. General Peterson?

303
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:24,080
Thermite plasma incendiary systems
can burn hot enough to consume V.X.,

304
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,760
but they're still in the test
phase; it's not operational.

305
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,320
Hummel knows this. We are dealing
with one smart son of a bitch.

306
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:36,200
What's it gonna take to equip a flight
of F-18s with thermite plasma...

307
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,960
within the next 36 hours?

308
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,600
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

309
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,760
All right, we can try.

310
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,240
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

311
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,560
Then we have to go to
our primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

312
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,200
Sir, I'd like to bring in
our SEAL ground commander,
Commander Anderson.

313
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,000
Mr Womack, who is your best
chemical/biological man?

314
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,160
- Oh, that's interesting.
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

315
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,960
- You like my pigtails?
- Oh, yeah, the pigtails
are very naughty.

316
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,920
Naughty. Naughty.

317
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:20,440
Just the Amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

318
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,920
- This isn't happening.
- No, Stan, don't answer it.

319
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,080
- This isn't happening!
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

320
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,920
- I have to. It's the office, baby.
They know I'm home.
- No.

321
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,640
How could they possibly know
that you're home?

322
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,960
It's the FBI.

323
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,080
Stanley!

324
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,800
Goodspeed.
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

325
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,240
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah,
downstairs in ten minutes.

326
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,840
No, you won't.

327
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,640
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

328
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,840
Stanley, no, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

329
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,040
Are you kidding me right now?
You need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

330
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,760
- I've got to go, baby.
- Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

331
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,080
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And
this causes a serious problem for me.

332
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,160
I cannot believe you.

333
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,080
No, no.

334
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,560
I love you.
I will marry you.

335
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:27,320
I just didn't plan on this,
that's all.

336
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,520
- Come to San Francisco.
- Really?

337
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,520
Yeah, I'm sure it's just
a training exercise.

338
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,920
Check into the hotel.
Order up some champagne.

339
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,000
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

340
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,840
- Baby, you're gonna marry me?
- You know it.

341
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,640
You're gonna marry me!

342
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,520
- Oh, honey, come on.
Just a really quick one.
- Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

343
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,680
A night-time airdrop incursion
is out due to the full moon.

344
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,680
Likewise a frontal
seaside attack.

345
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,120
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

346
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,880
Our only alternative is an
attack from within the prison.

347
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,440
We penetrate the island
through the tunnels under the
prison buildings undetected...

348
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,480
and emerge in its centre; that way
we can jump the Marines from behind.

349
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:08,320
And if we're lucky, take their
rocket positions without a shot fired.

350
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,880
I don't understand. You-you've studied
the architectural plans?

351
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,920
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

352
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,000
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

353
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,600
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

354
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,040
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

355
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,280
All the guards we contacted
were useless.

356
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,360
Um, there is someone
who I think can help us.

357
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,600
- This is for the sake
of national security.
- No!

358
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,400
It's the sake of national
security that got us here
in the first place 33 years ago.

359
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,320
I knew! I knew someday
this would come back to bite us.

360
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,280
Forget it!
He does not exist.

361
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,880
He does exist! We just chose
to forget him for 30 years.

362
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,080
- We locked him up
and threw away the key.
- Oh, and a lot of goddam good it did us.

363
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,920
He broke out of two maximum security
prisons. And if he hits the streets...

364
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,360
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

365
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Thirty years ago he was
a highly trained SAS operative.

366
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,360
He is my age now,
for Christ's sake!

367
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,320
I have to get up three times
a night to take a piss.

368
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,560
We can't risk
letting him out.

369
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:14,280
<i>He's a professional
escape artist.</i>

370
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,280
- Gosh. Neat, uh...
- Yeah.
- Neat, neat plane.

371
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,720
Dr Goodspeed.
James Womack.

372
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,480
- A pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

373
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,400
You come
very highly recommended.

374
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:00,000
B.A. Columbia;
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

375
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,160
Biochemistry, toxicology.

376
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,800
Well, I'm one of those fortunate
people who like my job, sir.

377
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,720
Got my first chemistry set
when I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

378
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,760
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

379
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,640
What do you know
about V.X. Gas?

380
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,040
Liquid. Failed pesticide
discovered by a mistake in 1952.

381
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,720
Uh, actually, it's kind of like
champagne that way.

382
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,560
The Franciscan monks thought
they were making white wine.

383
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,480
<i>Somehow the bottle carbonated.
Voilà! Champagne.</i>

384
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,120
- And then the whole thing just...
- The gas, Dr Goodspeed.

385
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,480
It's very, very horrible, sir.

386
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,880
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

387
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,520
This isn't a "train" exercise,
is it?

388
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:37,080
No, Dr Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

389
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
- Hello, sir.
- Good morning, Director.

390
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,120
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

391
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,320
- Dr Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- How do you do, sir?

392
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:26,840
It's been a fairly interesting day
so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

393
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,920
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.
Who is he anyway, sir?

394
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,880
His name is John Mason,
a British national...

395
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,960
incarcerated on Alcatraz
in 1962, escaped in '63.

396
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,680
I was under the impression that no one
ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

397
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:44,000
Paxton, don't argue!

398
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:48,240
This man has no identity, not
in the United States or Great Britain.

399
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,880
He does not exist.
Understand?

400
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,240
I want one thing:
How he escaped the Rock.

401
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,400
Specifically the route he took
through the island's bowels.

402
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,920
- The papers are in order, sir.
- We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

403
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:04,600
And Paxton, no strong-arming
Mason. I know him too well.

404
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,080
Well, if you know him,
then why don't you question him?

405
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,840
No, he'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

406
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,360
All right,
I'll take care of him.

407
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,960
Mr Mason, I'm Special Agent
in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

408
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,360
In charge of what? Fucking me
over for another three decades?

409
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,440
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

410
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,520
a special situation exists that we
feel you might be able to help us with.

411
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,880
Well, what might that be?

412
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,320
I've been in jail longer than
Nelson Mandela, so maybe you
want me to run for president.

413
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,680
- Not exactly.
- Mmm, a pity.

414
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,800
I feel rather like Alcamedes.

415
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:53,240
<i>- Who?
- Alcamedes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.</i>

416
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,600
- Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.
- James the First.

417
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:01,200
<i>Even someone as bright as you
must be aware that, uh,</i>

418
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,520
<i>there's a certain pattern
emerging here.</i>

419
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,720
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

420
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,160
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play
hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

421
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:12,440
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, pops.

422
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,240
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

423
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,720
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

424
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,040
You wanna hear what
I have to say or not?

425
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:24,800
<i>By all means, dear Paxton.
By all means.</i>

426
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,240
<i>We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.</i>

427
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,160
<i>There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.</i>

428
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:33,760
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

429
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:37,280
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

430
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,280
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know the Rock.

431
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,760
- You broke out.
- Yes, successfully.

432
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,840
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself
a favour while you're helpin' us?

433
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,800
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

434
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,040
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil.

435
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,560
While I'm considering
your offer,

436
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,840
<i>I want a suite
in the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

437
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,680
You know I'm here
to cut you a deal.

438
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,920
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

439
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,680
Here. Here's a quarter.

440
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:21,760
Do yourself a favour. Call your lawyer.
You're goin' back to jail.

441
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,880
- Y-You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

442
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,200
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

443
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,000
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think we have time...

444
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,520
for him to just sit around
and think about it.

445
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,840
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.

446
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,120
- You go talk to him.
- Me?
- Yes.

447
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:41,760
- Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- You're an FBI agent!

448
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,000
- W-What is your specialty again?
- Chemical weapons.

449
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,760
Don't mention that!

450
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,880
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

451
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,680
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

452
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:01,280
Okay.

453
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,520
Hi.

454
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:12,640
I'm an agent with the, uh,
uh, F-Federal...

455
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,600
FBI. Uh...

456
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:19,440
- Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.
- But of course you are.

457
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,000
Well, at least
he got his name right.

458
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,840
- Of course I am. Huh.
- And you have an emergency.

459
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,320
That's right.

460
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,640
And you need my help.

461
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,400
Exactly right.

462
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,240
- Coffee.
- No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

463
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:41,320
Offer me coffee.

464
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,080
Oh, yes! Well, that was,
in fact, gonna be my next...

465
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,920
Can we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

466
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,760
And offer
to take these off.

467
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,520
<i>Mr Mason, really.</i>

468
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,040
- All kidding aside.
- As a gesture of your good faith.

469
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,600
<i>- Prisoner requests to have
his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no, no.</i>

470
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,120
<i>Why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?</i>

471
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,840
Well, I guess
that's one way to go.

472
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,120
This is a pardon and release contract
from the attorney general's office.

473
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Now, it makes you a free man
provided you cooperate.

474
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,720
So if you'll just, uh, sign,

475
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,800
uh, at, uh,
where it says...

476
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,120
- "Signature"?
- That's... Yes. "Signature."

477
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,160
<i>Well, timeo danaos
et dona ferentis.</i>

478
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,320
"I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

479
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,000
Oh, an educated man!

480
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:45,200
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

481
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,160
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr Mason.

482
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,560
- Really?
- Yes.

483
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,320
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

484
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,480
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

485
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,480
Well-trained.

486
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,560
<i>Then it's
the Fairmont Hotel.</i>

487
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,080
<i>Okay.</i>

488
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,080
I want a suite,
a shower, a shave...

489
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,040
and the feel of a suit.

490
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,360
May I also suggest, uh,
a haircut?

491
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:22,760
- Am I out of style?
- Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

492
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,040
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

493
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,160
<i>Yeah, well, uh, uh...
Okay, thank you very much.</i>

494
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:32,880
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,
but I want him sealed off.

495
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,960
And he gets two hours max.

496
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,960
- Great job, Goodspeed.
- Why didn't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you were at it?

497
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,520
- I'll deliver this
to the attorney general.
- Uh, no, you'll give it to me.
Give it to me, Reynolds.

498
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:02,440
And take Attorney Reynolds
outside. There's a car
waiting for you. Thank you.

499
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:08,320
That's a signed federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

500
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,920
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

501
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:15,400
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

502
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,840
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know
basis, and you don't need to know.

503
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,960
It's, uh, it's, eh,
kind of curious, but, uh,

504
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,320
Sir Walter Raleigh,
Alcamedes, Solzhenitsyn,

505
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:29,280
they, um, well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

506
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:43,400
Womack! Now, why am I not
surprised, you piece of shit!

507
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,760
Eh, peace! Peace!

508
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,600
<i>Hey, we're not home.
Leave a message.</i>

509
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,880
Hi, darling, it's, uh,
it's me.

510
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,000
Uh, listen, don't come
to San Francisco.

511
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,520
I repeat, do not come
to San Francisco.

512
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,200
<i>- Stanley, no!
- Carla.
- Wha...</i>

513
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,760
<i>- Carla.
- Like hell I'm not coming!</i>

514
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,280
Wait. Car...

515
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:17,640
Who's Carla? And why don't you want her
to come to San Francisco?

516
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,640
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

517
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,680
Watch it, he'll bite you.

518
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,440
Good. Mobile Command
is fully operational.

519
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,080
- We'll be there in
approximately two hours.
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

520
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,800
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

521
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,160
I left it in my,
uh, my sock drawer.

522
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,160
A gun?

523
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,920
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

524
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,520
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually. But I still need a gun.

525
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,760
Give him a goddam gun.

526
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,880
Have you fired one of
those things since the Academy?

527
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,080
<i>- Wear some
- If you're going to

<i>- Some gentle people there

<i>If you're going
to San Francisco</i>

534
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,000
Uh, uh, room service?

535
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:45,600
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse.
Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

536
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,840
Hello!

537
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:50,240
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

538
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,840
Barber.

539
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,840
- Just clippers. No scissors.
- No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors!

540
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,240
I mean, did they tell Picasso,
"No brush"?

541
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,160
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

542
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,040
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer now, can I?

543
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,200
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

544
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,560
Oh, who did this to you? This is just
not right. In fact, it's nasty!

545
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,440
Well, it's a grunge thing.

546
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,720
Well, it's some kind
of thing.

547
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,720
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some colour?

548
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,040
No.

549
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:29,000
Okay.
Not very nice, is he?

550
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,040
No, he's not.

551

Not when it's free.

555
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:59,320
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

556
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,320
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on,
have... Try some of this lobster.

557
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,760
- Mm-hmm.
- My secretary here will settle the bill.

558
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,160
So what do you have in store for
me, Womack, when this is over?

559
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,080
You'll get your life back,
Mason.

560
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:16,040
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

561
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,960
- Why should I trust you now?
- You've got my word.

562
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,200
Will you shake on it?

563
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,040
- Freeze, mister!
- Oh, man!

564
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,840
Help!

565
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,800
Drop the gun
or I drop your boss.

566
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,080
You will not!

567
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,040
Get!

568
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,760
- He's getting very heavy.
- Then pull him up.

569
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,160
Please don't!

570
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,040
Help! Shit!

571
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,880
Come on, have a scallop.
Come on, catch.

572
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,160
You hoist him!

573
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,240
Help! Help! Help!

574
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,520
- Where's Mason? Where is Mason?
- Help! Hang on!

575
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,880
- Where's Mason?
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

576
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:31,000
Clear.

577
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,880
Living room's clear!

578
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,280
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

579
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,240
All units, this is Caretaker.
We have a Signal Six.
He's in the hotel!

580
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:50,920
Okay, I don't wanna know
nothin'. I never saw you throw
that gentleman off the balcony.

581
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:55,200
All I care about is, a-are
you happy with your haircut?

582
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:57,720
Easy!

583
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:03,120
Watch it, you fuckhead,
you're gonna pull my arm out!

584
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:06,880
Watch out!

585
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,560
Oh, no!

586
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,720
Watch it!

587
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,520
- Hey, watch it!
- He's over there!

588
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,920
Hey!

589
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:53,560
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches,
or I'll have your ass. Hey!

590
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,240
Hey! Stop! Hey!

591
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,640
Hey, I was inside the bedroom
with Jack Powell!

592
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:04,440
Hey, call the guard! Go!

593
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,600
FBI.

594
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,000
Move!

595
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:31,360
Whoa! Whoa!

596
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:35,000
Suspect is in a black Humvee,
heading west on California.

597
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,200
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

598
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,880
Get out of the way!

599
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,440
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

600
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:28,480
This guy's hittin'
every fuckin' thing in sight
tryin' to block us!

601
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,480
I hope you're insured!

602
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,320
Oh, well, why not?

603
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,520
You're goin' down!

604
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,840
Hello?

605
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,360
I'm only borrowing
your Humvee!

606
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,120
Information?
San Francisco?

607
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,320
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G...

608
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,880
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

609
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,440
Hang on!

610
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:32,920
Holy shit!

611
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,960
Whoa-oa!

612
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,560
Oh, no!

613
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:55,800
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

614
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,520
Oh, my baby!

615
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,320
Oh, no!

616
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:25,600
Oh, no.

617
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,440
Oh, God!

618
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,200
Oh, God!

619
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:56,640
Hey, man, you just fucked up
your Ferrari.

620
00:48:56,760 --> 00:49:00,640
- Oh, no! Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

621
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,360
Neither is this!

622
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,880
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

623
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:13,720
I'm gonna hunt him down! That
motherfucker ain't safe nowhere.

624
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,960
- Chem weapons. Isherwood.
- Marvin, look up Wolfburg
Federal Penitentiary.

625
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,040
The inmate is Mason, John.

626
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:25,080
Hey, Stan, listen, I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

627
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,040
I'm goin' over to Orkin to
design roach motels. Cool, huh?

628
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:32,320
Look, I just stole a kid's motorcycle.
I'm not really feeling too good
about it, okay? Wolfburg. Got it?

629
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:36,840
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

630
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:41,720
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

631
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,600
This is weird.
They got medical records.

632
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:50,960
They got place of birth. Glasgow.
Uh, but they don't have a name.

633
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:52,800
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
They have next of kin.

634
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,160
AJade Angelou of
32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

635
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,600
Jade?

636
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,400
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

637
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,000
Were you afraid
to come alone?

638
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:31,920
Yeah.

639
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,960
- It's okay.
- I'll be over here if you need me.

640
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:40,720
The last photograph I had
of you, you were about ten.

641
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:43,160
Yeah?

642
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:48,240
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things when she died.

643
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:54,720
Oh, yeah? Well, uh...
Why don't we take a walk?

644
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,680
I got 'im.
Palace of Fine Arts.

645
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,760
Your mother, uh... Yeah, well,
sh-she was very special.

646
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:04,360
Yeah, she was.

647
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:08,560
But I don't think that we
should romanticize what happened
between you and her.

648
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,520
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

649
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:14,360
Head out,
and I was the result.

650
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,360
Well, I'd like to think it
would've led somewhere if only...

651
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,640
If only what? Six federal marshals
hadn't kicked down our door...

652
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,120
and dragged you back
to prison?

653
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:27,080
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

654
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,760
- So, they let you out?
- Yeah.

655
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,840
That's good.

656
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,480
What did you do?

657
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:41,280
J...

658
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,840
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

659
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:52,680
But I'll be coming back.
And, uh...

660
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,400
- Maybe we can...
- What? We can what?

661
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:02,440
You know, you're almost
the only evidence...

662
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:05,000
that I exist.

663
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,960
But I don't know you.

664
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,120
That's what I want to change, eh?

665
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,160
I've rehearsed this speech
a thousand times on the chance
that we would meet.

666
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:21,160
Here we are,
and I'm lost.

667
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:24,040
Well, I don't know how I'm
supposed to be feeling either.

668
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,200
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

669
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,440
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

670
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,080
Okay.

671
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:50,480
Is this about you?

672
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:07,680
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you? Why did you come to me?

673
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:11,560
FBI, ma'am.
Your father's working with us.

674
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,640
He's helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

675
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:16,160
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

676
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:19,200
Well, gee whiz, John, I guess
we oughta get goin', huh?

677
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,800
Whatever you say, Stanley.

678
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:30,440
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

679
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:33,760
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

680
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:37,840
You almost got me killed twice.
And my jaw hurts like hell!

681
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,280
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

682
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,760
If I had my way, you would be
shipped back to Wolfburg
in leg irons...

683
00:53:43,880 --> 00:53:47,320
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fucking life!

684
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:48,840
You wrecked half the city!

685
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,080
Now, tell me about
the tunnels.

686
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,440
If you know the system, it will
take you wherever you need to go.

687
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:05,520
All right, there's an intake
pipe here, below low tide.
Is that our best access?

688
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,040
Yes. That's exactly where
I had come out.

689
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:11,600
Then beneath the cistern,
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

690
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:13,360
How many feet is that?

691
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,640
Uh, 57 paces.

692
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,840
Where do we go from there?

693
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,920
Where do we go from there?

694
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,520
That's a good question.

695
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,320
- I have no idea.
- What?

696
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:35,680
I mean, I'll know it
when we're all inside.

697
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,240
No. You're not goddam goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

698
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:43,560
I can't! My blueprint
was in my head.

699
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,000
I was underground
for three days in the dark,

700
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:49,720
just waiting for the tides
to be right.

701
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,240
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

702
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,920
You're not going anywhere,
Mason.

703
00:54:56,040 --> 00:55:01,240
Wait a second. Now, this piece
of work might be the only chance
those people over there have.

704
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,960
If he's not going, then why the
hell did we get him out of jail?

705
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:07,520
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

706
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,760
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

707
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,600
He'll fuck with you.

708
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:17,480
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

709
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:21,560
Now, Womack,

710
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,320
you're between the Rock
and a hard case.

711
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:29,880
How is your bowling arm?

712
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,120
Dr Goodspeed, the goal is
to take out the launchers,

713
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,720
then neutralize the
V.X. Chemical rounds.

714
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:39,400
Well, we know the poison's being
kept in the prison morgue from
the satellite thermal imaging...

715
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:42,160
which is right here;
these colourized dots.

716
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:46,520
- Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?
- No, sir, but I've studied them.

717
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:50,040
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

718
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,800
Got a really neat layout
over here of the chem round
as well as the rocket,

719
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,760
- so let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

720
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,840
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

721
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:04,280
The power of this chemical is way
beyond anything you can imagine.

722
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,040
An ecological disaster, sir.

723
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,560
Plus the devices themselves
are complicated.

724
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,400
That's why you're
coming with us.

725
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:18,160
- I am?
- You're the expert. What's your problem?

726
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:22,960
You mean I'm going, going
out there, under the water?

727
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,320
Well, earlier today
you wanted a gun.

728
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:27,640
Now you're getting a gun
and a wet suit.

729
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,400
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

730
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,000
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

731
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:36,600
An incursion underwater to
retake an impregnable fortress
held by an elite team...

732
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,840
of U.S. Marines
in possession of 81 hostages
and 15 guided rockets...

733
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:43,040
armed with
V.X. Poisoned gas.

734
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:46,920
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

735
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,280
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

736
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,640
You don't look too good.

737
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,400
In fact,
you look like shit.

738
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:06,760
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

739
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,240
You all right?

740
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,440
I mean, you gonna make it
through this thing?

741
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:14,600
I don't know.

742
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,120
I always expected something
like this was going to happen,

743
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:20,040
but nothing prepares you
for it.

744
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:22,440
Now I'm...
I'm responsible...

745
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:24,480
for a whole city.

746
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:29,280
Look, I know this
isn't easy for you.

747
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,600
Remember you were trained
for this kind of a situation...

748
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,760
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

749
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:37,240
Besides, you got the best
SEAL team in the country backing you up.

750
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:41,080
Okay.
You're right.

751
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,760
L-I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

752
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:47,680
There's something else.

753
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:51,320
It's terrible.
N-No, it's wonderful,

754
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:53,840
except it isn't.

755
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:57,240
My girlfriend's pregnant...

756
00:57:57,360 --> 00:58:01,200
and she's just flown in
to see me.

757
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:04,040
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight.

758
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,120
And I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command centre.

759
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:23,600
<i>- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.</i>

760
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,480
<i>I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.</i>

761
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:31,480
Uh, Frank, uh,
we're havin' a few problems
with the account transfer.

762
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,040
<i>- Don't tell me problems,
tell me solutions.
- Now, we've spoken to the president,</i>

763
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,520
and I know that you're
well aware of his stance on terrorism.

764
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:42,840
- So what we'd like to do is...
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

765
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,560
It's about reminding you people
who found it politically
convenient to forget.

766
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:48,000
This is goin' nowhere,
Frank.

767
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,840
Well, then, let me tell you
what is.

768
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:52,400
Fifteen V.X. Gas rockets
into the heart of San Francisco.

769
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:54,800
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

770
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,560
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

771
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,480
- What's the word from Mojave?
- General Peterson can give us...

772
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:08,640
no definite assurance
on the thermite plasma.

773
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,800
That is the word.

774
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:17,480
Green light
to SEAL incursion.

775
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:39,080
Fall in!
All right, listen up.

776
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,280
Mr Mason will run point
for us.

777
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,360
Lieutenant Shepard will be
attached to his hip.

778
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:47,480
You breathe, he breathes
with you. You piss, he helps.

779
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,440
Understood?

780
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,920
Dr Goodspeed
is our specialist.

781
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:56,800
When he neutralizes the threat,
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

782
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:00,920
Make no mistake, gentlemen.
We're in the fight of our lives...

783
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:03,960
against maybe the greatest battalion
commander in the Vietnam War.

784
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:06,280
I shit you not.

785
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,280
Any questions?

786
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:12,040
Let's load up!

787
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,640
After you, ace.

788
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:46,520
Pass out and activate
the minicams.

789
01:00:49,080 --> 01:00:52,800
Everything set here?
Minicams operational?

790
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,400
Roger that, sir.
We are on-line.

791
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:05,160
Shep, what's the status on the
special operational gear for Mr Mason?

792
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,400
Uh, let's see.
We have, uh,

793
01:01:10,560 --> 01:01:13,280
one quart of kerosene
in a squeeze bottle.

794
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:21,160
Three washers
and waterproof matches.

795
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,600
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

796
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:27,080
Now, this is atropine. If you
come in contact with the gas,

797
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,360
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

798
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:32,760
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

799
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:39,440
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 275.

800
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,960
Range: 6,000 metres.

801
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,360
FBI Command Centre?

802
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:51,640
- Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.
- Nope.

803
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,920
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed
is my boyfriend.
Actually, he's, um, my fiancé.

804
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:57,440
- Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

805
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,560
Okay. Well, you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

806
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,800
Hey, where are you g...
Goddam it!

807
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:10,440
Decoy choppers
commencing run to Alcatraz.

808
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,360
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

809
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,440
<i>- We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.
- Shit!</i>

810
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:31,680
In my day, we did it all with a
snorkel and a pair of flippers.

811
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:35,120
- Your day?
- Yes. Didn't you read my résumé?

812
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,240
I don't...
I don't know anything about you.

813
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,800
- Hmm. I know something
about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

814
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:44,560
Goodspeed, Godspeed,
Godspell,

815
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:47,360
you never went to
any antiterrorist school.

816
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,360
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

817
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,480
- We're goin' dark.
- Night vision!

818
01:02:58,120 --> 01:03:00,360
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage,

819
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:02,360
heading around
Treasure Island.

820
01:03:04,360 --> 01:03:07,520
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

821
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:14,320
Decoys?

822
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:17,400
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

823
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,440
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

824
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:29,920
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

825
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:33,520
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

826
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,360
- Good to go!
- Good to go! Good to go!

827
01:03:46,840 --> 01:03:49,560
All right, so the S.D.U. S
have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

828
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:01,800
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled
to the west end of the island.

829
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:04,040
- Double-time it.
- Yes, sir. Hendrix!

830
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,120
- You lead the patrol.
- Aye, aye, sir.

831
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,280
Let's move. Move out!
Move out! Move out!

832
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,680
The Eagles are on the Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

833
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:17,200
Thank you very fucking much,
Mr Mason.

834
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:19,640
You've led us into a room
with no exit.

835
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:26,520
- Any ideas, Dillinger?
- Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

836
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,160
We're a little tight
on time.

837
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:31,560
You stand by the door
until I open it.

838
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:34,840
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that?

839
01:05:35,920 --> 01:05:38,160
Through here.

840
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,880
- You're shitting me.
- I memorized the timing.

841
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,880
I just hope
it hasn't been changed.

842
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,920
You catch one of those
flame bursts, you're a corpse.

843
01:05:53,040 --> 01:05:56,240
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never
to leave his sight, but, uh...

844
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,360
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

845
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,320
Have a nice day.

846
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:27,520
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

847
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,760
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

848
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:41,600
- Nothing.
- Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

849
01:06:41,720 --> 01:06:43,960
Sweep forward!

850
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,560
Looks like he fucked us,
Commander.

851
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,760
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

852
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,160
Welcome to the Rock.

853
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:23,760
- Mason.
- That's a no-no.

854
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:27,600
That's the subway. That'll
drop you into the tunnels.

855
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:29,840
Do it!

856
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:49,800
Sir, the Eagles have breached
the tunnel system.

857
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,760
You enjoying this?

858
01:07:58,880 --> 01:08:01,920
Well, it's certainly more
enjoyable than my average day.

859
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:06,400
Reading philosophy, avoiding
gang rape in the washroom.

860
01:08:06,560 --> 01:08:10,480
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

861
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,240
We've got seismic activity in
one of the storm grates. North side.

862
01:08:18,360 --> 01:08:21,080
Continue patrolling
the area.

863
01:08:21,240 --> 01:08:23,080
Sweep forward!

864
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,280
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

865
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,320
<i>- They're hearing sounds above, sir.
- Stand fast.</i>

866
01:08:31,440 --> 01:08:34,200
Down, down, down.

867
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:42,080
West storm drain's clear.

868
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:50,160
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

869
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,680
The Eagles are now at the access
tunnel. They're right under
the shower room, sir.

870
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:07,600
Fibre optics.

871
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,880
- Something's not right.
- I got a bad feeling about this.

872
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:35,360
Quiet.

873
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,120
Motion sensors.

874
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:52,240
- Beams cutting across
the manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

875
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,480
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

876
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:03,400
Possibly a prism.

877
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,920
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam,

878
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:13,320
send the beam back to its source
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

879
01:10:17,800 --> 01:10:20,280
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

880
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,520
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

881
01:10:25,720 --> 01:10:29,120
Got it.
Good to go.

882
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:33,440
- Fuck, man! I knew this
would happen! Fuck!
- Move!

883
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:35,680
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

884
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:50,120
They're entering
into the shower room, sir.

885
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,280
They're securing the area.

886
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,480
Just sit tight.

887
01:11:09,280 --> 01:11:12,040
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

888
01:11:12,160 --> 01:11:14,320
- Stand fast!
- Hold your fire!

889
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:16,480
- Drop your weapons!
- Hold your fire!

890
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:23,040
It's a fucking trap.

891
01:11:23,160 --> 01:11:24,840
This is General Hummel.

892
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:29,000
Drop your weapons.
Drop 'em!

893
01:11:29,120 --> 01:11:32,080
Anderson here,
General Hummel.

894
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,760
Commander. Team leader.

895
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:37,840
Commander Anderson, if you have
any concern for the lives of your men,

896
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:40,960
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

897
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,920
This is not happening.

898
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:46,480
Sir, we know why
you're out here.

899
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,880
God knows
I agree with you.

900
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,240
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies,

901
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:57,400
foreign, sir,
and domestic.

902
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,040
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

903
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:03,800
You know goddam well
I can't give that order.

904
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,600
We're dead.

905
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:09,200
Your unit is covered from
an elevated position, Commander.

906
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:13,080
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't do anything stupid.

907
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,600
No one has to die here.

908
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:20,080
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

909
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:23,200
Have you forgotten that?

910
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,440
We all have shipmates
we remember.

911
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,880
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

912
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:33,080
- But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!
- You call it what you want!

913
01:12:33,200 --> 01:12:37,120
You're down there, we're up
here. You walked into the wrong
goddam room, Commander!

914
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:39,200
- Stand fast!
- Goddam it, Commander, one last time.

915
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:41,440
You tell your men to safety
their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

916
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:44,120
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

917
01:12:44,240 --> 01:12:47,040
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

918
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,920
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

919
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:53,440
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time. You order
your men to safety their weapons...

920
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,000
Cease fire!

921
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:24,680
Don't go.

922
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,520
Cease fire!

923
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,320
Cease fire!

924
01:13:39,480 --> 01:13:41,600
Shit! Goddam it!

925
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:44,040
Let go of me.
Let go of me!

926
01:13:44,160 --> 01:13:46,240
Don't. Don't go.

927
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,320
It's over.

928
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:49,200
Oh, God!

929
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,320
Mason.

930
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:23,200
- We got some movement.
- Who?
- Two of'em!

931
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:25,000
- Who is it?
- Eagles 11 and 12.

932
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:27,800
- L-It's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

933
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,480
I've gotta get a team together
right now. We've gotta move
with the second option.

934
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:33,000
What, and invite
another massacre? No way.

935
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:37,840
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

936
01:15:37,960 --> 01:15:40,040
Not for Mason,
it isn't.

937
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:55,600
Goodspeed,
I'm not gonna kill you.

938
01:15:58,160 --> 01:16:00,920
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

939
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,680
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

940
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:07,440
<i>Goodspeed.
Goodspeed, do you read me?</i>

941
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:09,240
It's for you.

942
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:13,040
<i>- Sir?
- What's the status?</i>

943
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,920
The status is they're dead.
They're dead!

944
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,040
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

945
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:22,440
<i>That is unacceptable.
Do you hear me? Unacceptable!</i>

946
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:25,160
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

947
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:28,360
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

948
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:31,160
<i>- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.</i>

949
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,520
I didn't want this.

950
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:38,240
- Jesus, I didn't want this.
- You knew this might happen, Frank.

951
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:41,440
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

952
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:44,080
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

953
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:47,400
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

954
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,080
- You heard him. End it!
- Holster that sidearm, Captain.

955
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:11,440
Sir?

956
01:17:14,920 --> 01:17:17,360
<i>You made
a terrible mistake.</i>

957
01:17:17,480 --> 01:17:20,680
<i>And more of our brothers
have died in vain.</i>

958
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,880
<i>Damn you for forcing me
into this position.</i>

959
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:29,960
I need to talk to you
right now, alone.

960
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,480
Now you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis.

961
01:17:32,600 --> 01:17:37,880
And I'm tellin' you right now,
I need to know who the fuck
John Mason is right now, sir.

962
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:42,080
All right, you wanna know?
1962,J. Edgar Hoover...

963
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,960
is head of the FBI,
some say the country.

964
01:17:45,080 --> 01:17:48,960
It's no secret he kept
microfilm files on prominent
Americans and Europeans:

965
01:17:49,080 --> 01:17:52,640
De Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the Prime Minister.

966
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:55,840
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

967
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:59,560
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

968
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,400
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

969
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,280
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

970
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:08,680
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

971
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:10,720
And we held him
without trial...

972
01:18:10,840 --> 01:18:15,200
until he gave up the microfilm,
but he never did.

973
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:18,040
Well, I'm surprised Hoover
didn't use his daughter as leverage.

974
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:21,400
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

975
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,120
Today, well, it's
a different Bureau.

976
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:29,520
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

977
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:34,000
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half century:

978
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:38,360
The alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. Assassination.

979
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:42,240
And Mason's angry, he's lethal,
he's a trained killer.

980
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:47,880
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

981
01:18:48,240 --> 01:18:50,920
Mason! Mason!

982
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:55,520
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

983
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:57,400
Yeah, like me.

984
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,160
All right, you wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

985
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:03,040
Okay. FBI!
Freeze, sucker!

986
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:09,320
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

987
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:13,040
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

988
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,920
Let's find out.

989
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:22,280
I could; you, no.

990
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,800
Besides,
your safety's on.

991
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:28,520
<i>Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?</i>

992
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,560
Not yet.

993
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:37,080
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

994
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,680
You're right, I don't use guns
and I don't kick down doors.

995
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,520
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

996
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:46,960
What it says is
Chemical Weapons Specialist.

997
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:50,960
That's right.
I got a lunatic up there, man,

998
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:54,640
with 15 missiles armed
with some really funky stuff.

999
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:59,560
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1000
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:04,120
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1001
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:07,440
They've got my girlfriend in
the city with a baby on the way.

1002
01:20:07,560 --> 01:20:11,640
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1003
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,760
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1004
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:24,960
Sir, this man's weapons
and tack radio are missing!

1005
01:20:25,080 --> 01:20:28,760
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1006
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,680
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddam island.
Check every access you can find.

1007
01:20:31,800 --> 01:20:33,840
Sir.

1008
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,240
Even if you escape
from the island,

1009
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:45,600
you can't escape
the rockets.

1010
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:49,360
So, where are you gonna go? Go where?
What are, what are you gonna do?

1011
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:56,480
- Show me where the morgue is, Mason.
- I'm out of here.

1012
01:20:59,960 --> 01:21:02,560
What about your daughter?
Mason?

1013
01:21:04,840 --> 01:21:07,320
Rodents located.

1014
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,680
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1015
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,120
I don't think you do.

1016
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:27,280
Move!

1017
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,400
They're onto us.

1018
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:55,760
Burn 'em out.

1019
01:21:58,000 --> 01:22:00,200
This mother's gonna
blow big.

1020
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:45,400
I don't understand. How could
we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1021
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:48,000
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locaters.

1022
01:22:55,960 --> 01:22:59,800
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1023
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:03,120
How do you like
your choices?

1024
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:06,320
- I don't.
- That's what I thought.

1025
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:09,520
All right, come on.

1026
01:23:09,640 --> 01:23:13,080
This is the oldest part
of Alcatraz.

1027
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:16,000
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

1028
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:19,040
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too,

1029
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:22,480
maybe when this is all over, you and I
can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1030
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:26,760
But right now I just... I just...
I wanna find some rockets.

1031
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:32,920
Don't tempt me.
We are going to the morgue.

1032
01:23:56,520 --> 01:24:00,440
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1033
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:02,200
Your best?

1034
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:06,160
Losers always whine
about their best.

1035
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,160
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1036
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,560
Carla was
the prom queen.

1037
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:16,040
- Really?
- Yeah.

1038
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,840
Locaters have them approaching
the morgue, sir.

1039
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,440
Come on, come on.
You can do it, Doc.

1040
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,840
You must never hesitate.

1041
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,040
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1042
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,080
Him, but not the rocket.

1043
01:25:02,200 --> 01:25:04,400
Any other news,
Professor?

1044
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:09,920
Not the rocket!
Not the rocket.

1045
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:26,720
I got a little somethin'
for ya.

1046
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,160
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1047
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,880
Mason,

1048
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:02,520
the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

1049
01:26:02,680 --> 01:26:04,720
Put it over there.

1050
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:17,960
You've been around a lot
of corpses. Is that normal?

1051
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,760
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1052
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,800
- Yeah, that happens.
- Well, I'm having kind of
a hard time concentrating.

1053
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:28,840
- Can you do something about it?
- Well, like what? Kill him again?

1054
01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:31,840
Listen, I'm just
a biochemist.

1055
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:36,040
And most of the time I work in a glass
jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1056
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:40,320
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

1057
01:26:40,440 --> 01:26:43,080
is one of the most deadly substances
the Earth has ever known.

1058
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:45,840
So what do you say you cut me
some friggin' slack?

1059
01:27:02,280 --> 01:27:04,200
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

1060
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,960
Unfortunately,
incredibly unstable.

1061
01:27:07,120 --> 01:27:09,200
Well, what exactly
does this stuff do?

1062
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,360
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it
can take out the entire city of people.

1063
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,360
Really? And what happens
if you drop one?

1064
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:21,880
Happily, it'll just wipe out
you and me.

1065
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:24,360
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1066
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,720
Stops the brain from
sending nerve messages down the
spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1067
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,880
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

1068
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:35,520
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1069
01:27:35,640 --> 01:27:37,440
Do not move that!

1070
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:43,080
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe.

1071
01:27:43,240 --> 01:27:46,440
You spasm so hard you break your
own back, spit your guts out.

1072
01:27:46,560 --> 01:27:49,320
But that's after
your skin melts off.

1073
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:51,760
My God.

1074
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:55,040
Oh, I think we'd like God on our
side at the moment, don't you?

1075
01:27:57,240 --> 01:28:00,560
So what I'm doing now
is removing the guidance system chips...

1076
01:28:00,680 --> 01:28:02,640
so the rocket will splash down
after 500 feet.

1077
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,880
All right,
let me have that.

1078
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:09,040
You can let go of it. All right,
just back away. Just back away!

1079
01:28:09,160 --> 01:28:12,240
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

1080
01:28:15,120 --> 01:28:16,800
Blackbird One,
this is Blackbird. Over.

1081
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:21,920
<i>Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddam it!</i>

1082
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:27,720
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1083
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,120
Rats alive! Close on the morgue.
Close on the morgue.

1084
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:33,120
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go.

1085
01:28:33,240 --> 01:28:35,520
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1086
01:28:39,160 --> 01:28:41,120
Hold it.

1087
01:28:41,240 --> 01:28:43,800
Converge on the morgue.
Move out.

1088
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:47,720
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1089
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:51,080
Good. I love pressure.
I eat it for breakfast.

1090
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,880
Come on. Time's up.

1091
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:55,080
There's three rockets somewhere
else. We have to find them.

1092
01:28:58,600 --> 01:28:59,320
Come on!

1093
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:21,840
Clear!

1094
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,920
I'm too old for this.

1095
01:29:25,040 --> 01:29:28,720
- Where's it go?
- I've no idea.

1096
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:32,160
Sir, all the guidance chips
are gone.

1097
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,360
Captain, I guess you didn't
quite take care of the rat problem.

1098
01:29:34,520 --> 01:29:36,520
- No, sir.
- Well, there are two dead men here...

1099
01:29:36,640 --> 01:29:40,080
- who strongly suggest
you go finish the job.
- Yes, sir.

1100
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:43,200
Yes, sir!
Rio, Royce, let's go!

1101
01:29:43,360 --> 01:29:45,360
Move out!

1102
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:53,560
- You really don't know where this goes?
- No, I don't know where it goes.

1103
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:55,880
Well, it's starting to pick up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1104
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,040
No, I don't.

1105
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,360
God.

1106
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:39,240
Mason, you all right?

1107
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:42,040
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot!

1108
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:46,960
- They're coming.
- Who?

1109
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:49,920
- The Marines!
- Where?

1110
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:55,280
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1111
01:32:01,280 --> 01:32:04,240
No! No! No!

1112
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,840
Mason!

1113
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,800
Mason!

1114
01:33:41,200 --> 01:33:46,560
You motherfucker!
Die! Die! Die!

1115
01:34:06,720 --> 01:34:10,440
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1116
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:17,240
How do you do it?

1117
01:34:19,120 --> 01:34:23,160
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1118
01:34:25,400 --> 01:34:27,240
Come on.

1119
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:31,680
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1120
01:34:31,800 --> 01:34:33,400
Okay.

1121
01:34:37,720 --> 01:34:40,800
Okay, the president arrives
in three hours.

1122
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:45,800
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1123
01:34:45,920 --> 01:34:49,200
- What's the word
from Mojave, General?
- The same as last time, Lou.

1124
01:34:49,320 --> 01:34:52,000
They're going as fast
as they can.

1125
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:00,880
- Do it over here.
- On your knees. On your knees!

1126
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,120
<i>Navy SEALs, listen up. You've
got something that belongs to me.</i>

1127
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:16,680
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

1128
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:21,440
Let me remind you there are
lives at stake, civilian lives.

1129
01:35:21,560 --> 01:35:23,520
Speak up.

1130
01:35:23,640 --> 01:35:27,600
- Speak up!
- I, uh, uh...

1131
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,520
- Tell them your name.
- My name is Larry Henderson.

1132
01:35:30,640 --> 01:35:34,720
<i>- Oh, man.
- And I'm a father of three.</i>

1133
01:35:34,840 --> 01:35:38,160
<i>And, uh, they've got a gun
to my head.</i>

1134
01:35:38,280 --> 01:35:42,040
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips
to the exercise yard...

1135
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:44,880
<i>- or Mr Henderson won't have a head.
- Oh, no.</i>

1136
01:35:46,120 --> 01:35:48,680
Hey. Wha...

1137
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:51,040
Now, three to go.

1138
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:54,200
You find them
and defuse them, okay?

1139
01:35:55,480 --> 01:35:57,000
- All right.
- All right.

1140
01:35:57,120 --> 01:36:00,720
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1141
01:36:00,840 --> 01:36:04,000
Hey, what about
Mr Henderson's head?

1142
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:09,560
Okay?
What do you mean?

1143
01:36:15,280 --> 01:36:17,240
Okay.

1144
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,720
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1145
01:36:34,640 --> 01:36:36,920
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

1146
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,600
Bingo.

1147
01:37:01,720 --> 01:37:03,800
Stand easy.

1148
01:37:07,360 --> 01:37:10,440
Thought I'd been in the service
a long time.

1149
01:37:10,600 --> 01:37:14,840
- Name and rank, sailor.
- Well, it's Army, actually.

1150
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:20,280
Answer the question. And
address him as "General, sir."

1151
01:37:20,440 --> 01:37:23,520
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir,

1152
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:27,520
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.
Retired, of course.

1153
01:37:31,480 --> 01:37:35,040
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

1154
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:36,720
How the hell are you
involved in this?

1155
01:37:36,840 --> 01:37:39,280
Oh, I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1156
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,720
I was, uh,
formerly a guest here.

1157
01:37:57,160 --> 01:37:59,240
Hi, sweetie.

1158
01:38:06,560 --> 01:38:08,560
Hey, come back here,
little boy.

1159
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:12,760
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this?

1160
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:15,360
Or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1161
01:38:15,480 --> 01:38:19,320
All I know is you were big
in Vietnam. I saw the highlights
on television.

1162
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:22,560
Then you wouldn't have any
fuckin' idea what it means to
lead some of the finest men...

1163
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:26,040
on God's earth into battle, and
then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government.

1164
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:29,320
I don't quite see how you cherish
the memory of the dead...

1165
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:32,160
by killing
another million.

1166
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:35,360
And, uh,
this is not combat.

1167
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:39,760
It's an act of lunacy,
General, sir.

1168
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,560
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1169
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:51,000
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

1170
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:54,680
with the blood of patriots
and tyrants." Thomas Jefferson.

1171
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:59,720
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1172
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:09,400
- Thank you for making my point.
- Where are the guidance chips?

1173
01:39:09,520 --> 01:39:12,240
Where are
the guidance chips?

1174
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:16,440
- I destroyed them.
- That was a bad move, soldier.

1175
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,600
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

1176
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:50,200
You're lucky that old man Hummel
wants you alive.

1177
01:39:50,320 --> 01:39:52,280
'Cause I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

1178
01:39:59,080 --> 01:40:03,000
<i>I'd take pleasure
in guttin'you</i>

1179
01:40:03,120 --> 01:40:04,680
<i>Boy</i>

1180
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:08,200
"I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy."

1181
01:40:09,880 --> 01:40:12,120
What is wrong with
these people, huh, Mason?

1182
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:15,920
Don't you think there's
a lot of, uh, a lot of anger
floatin' around this island?

1183
01:40:16,040 --> 01:40:19,240
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

1184
01:40:19,360 --> 01:40:23,320
A lot of angst, a lot of, "I'm 16,
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1185
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,680
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

1186
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:29,040
with a bunch of
violence-for-pleasure-seeking
psychopathic Marines.

1187
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,800
Shame on them!

1188
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,800
Anyway, I only got one
chem round. There's two left.

1189
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,800
- Mason?
- Yes, I'm here.

1190
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:44,440
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

1191
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,880
when the inmates weren't allowed
to talk in here.

1192
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:49,680
Not allowed to talk.

1193
01:40:49,800 --> 01:40:51,920
How'd you do it?

1194
01:40:52,040 --> 01:40:57,640
Uh, nurtured the hope
that there was hope.

1195
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:00,360
That one day I'd breathe
free air.

1196
01:41:00,480 --> 01:41:03,800
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1197
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:08,760
Modest hopes, but, uh,
they kept a man alive.

1198
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,040
What'd they put you
away for, John?

1199
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:15,120
Oh, that's a long story.

1200
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:18,120
Well, I'm not goin'
anywhere.

1201
01:41:18,240 --> 01:41:21,280
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1202
01:41:21,400 --> 01:41:23,040
Seven hours.

1203
01:41:25,680 --> 01:41:27,880
Thermite plasma
is operational.

1204
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:31,200
- Get me the president.
- Be seated.

1205
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:35,440
Gentlemen, consider yourselves
on ground alert. If we receive
launch authority,

1206
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:39,240
your mission is
the complete thermal destruction
of Alcatraz Island.

1207
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:42,760
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1208
01:41:42,880 --> 01:41:45,680
Eighty-one American civilians
and a number of U.S. Marines...

1209
01:41:45,800 --> 01:41:48,120
will lose their lives
in this air strike.

1210
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,560
Why didn't you just tell them
where the microfilm was...

1211
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:55,520
and, and create a solution?

1212
01:41:55,640 --> 01:42:00,240
Hmph. The moment they had the
microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1213
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:04,320
- Some solution.
- And you ended up here.

1214
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:08,680
Which brings me to another
question. When you broke out...

1215
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:13,320
Let me see if I can get this straight.
You went down the incinerator chute,

1216
01:42:13,440 --> 01:42:17,800
on the mine cars, through
the tunnels to the power plant,

1217
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,760
under the steam engine... That
was really cool, by the way.

1218
01:42:21,880 --> 01:42:24,440
And into the cistern
through the intake pipe.

1219
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:30,040
But how, in the name
of Zeus's butthole,

1220
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:32,960
did you get out
of your cell?

1221
01:42:33,080 --> 01:42:35,800
I only ask because
in our current situation,

1222
01:42:35,920 --> 01:42:41,120
well, it could prove
to be useful information, maybe!

1223
01:42:59,440 --> 01:43:02,480
Trade secrets, my son.

1224
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:04,840
Wow.

1225
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,480
General, two
operational rockets left.

1226
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:09,320
One's at the lower lighthouse
and there is one on the roof.

1227
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:12,440
And both of the birds
are ready to fly, sir.

1228
01:43:12,560 --> 01:43:15,840
- G-General, can you hear me?
- I heard you, Captain.

1229
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:18,480
Oh, just makin' sure.

1230
01:43:18,600 --> 01:43:23,160
Should we prepare
for launch, General?

1231
01:43:23,280 --> 01:43:25,320
I'll handle the strategy,
Captain.

1232
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,000
Yes, sir.

1233
01:43:29,120 --> 01:43:33,000
The hour is approaching, sir.
Just letting the general know
of the time, sir.

1234
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:36,960
- I'm very aware of the time, Captain.
- Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1235
01:43:37,080 --> 01:43:39,720
Me and my boys are ready to
cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1236
01:43:42,240 --> 01:43:44,120
Mason, where're you going?

1237
01:43:44,240 --> 01:43:46,720
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1238
01:43:46,840 --> 01:43:52,240
You're not leaving! There's a madman in
there with his hand on a, on a button!

1239
01:43:52,360 --> 01:43:55,520
Shh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

1240
01:43:56,720 --> 01:43:59,720
Stop moving, Mason.

1241
01:43:59,880 --> 01:44:02,360
Mason, stop moving.

1242
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:06,120
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1243
01:44:06,240 --> 01:44:09,760
- I read it in his eyes.
- You read his eyes?

1244
01:44:09,880 --> 01:44:12,160
Oh, well, then,
everything's just fine!

1245
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,800
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1246
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:19,360
Three minutes to go, sir.

1247
01:44:19,480 --> 01:44:22,680
- They're not gonna call, Frank.
- Oh, they'll call.

1248
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:25,800
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

1249
01:44:25,920 --> 01:44:28,920
Sir.

1250
01:44:33,880 --> 01:44:36,520
<i>- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.</i>

1251
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:39,280
<i>- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's goin'?</i>

1252
01:44:39,400 --> 01:44:42,520
<i>- Listen, on this end we're gonna
need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.</i>

1253
01:44:42,640 --> 01:44:45,560
<i>Listen, uh, Frank, we have
to get final authorization
from the president.</i>

1254
01:44:45,720 --> 01:44:47,800
You've got three minutes.

1255
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:50,160
<i>Frank, please don't do
anything stupid.</i>

1256
01:44:52,760 --> 01:44:54,760
They want another hour.

1257
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:58,160
Well, that's bullshit.
That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1258
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:00,360
They're calling
our bluff, sir.

1259
01:45:00,480 --> 01:45:04,320
They're playing you
for a fool, sir.

1260
01:45:04,440 --> 01:45:07,640
Order the launch,
General.

1261
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,320
Come on, General.
Let's be all we can be.

1262
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:27,800
The mission's not complete!

1263
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,800
Well, mine is.

1264
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,680
When this is over,
you'll go back home,

1265
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:37,800
driving Carla and your baby
insane in your beige Volvo.

1266
01:45:37,920 --> 01:45:41,520
And I'll be dead or back in
prison, which is the same thing.

1267
01:45:41,640 --> 01:45:43,720
You're not leaving.

1268
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:52,240
All right,
I'll do it myself.

1269
01:45:53,760 --> 01:45:55,840
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

1270
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:59,880
I'll kick the... Out of
a platoon full of Marines.

1271
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:02,720
No problem.

1272
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,480
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery.
- Aye, sir.

1273
01:46:17,600 --> 01:46:21,040
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1274
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,520
Let's go!

1275
01:46:28,840 --> 01:46:29,880
Laser powered up!

1276
01:46:31,240 --> 01:46:36,440
- Oh, no.
- I said, on your knees!

1277
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:41,200
My name's Stanley Goodspeed. I'm a
chemical weapons specialist for the FBI.

1278
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:43,240
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1279
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,960
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?
- Shut the fuck up!

1280
01:46:46,080 --> 01:46:48,760
Because if the winds change
after you launch those rockets,

1281
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,880
- we're all gonna die.
- Shut up!

1282
01:46:51,000 --> 01:46:55,000
And you're gonna end up in either
a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1283
01:46:55,120 --> 01:46:58,400
So, what do you say you do
the math, h-hand over the gun...

1284
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:01,920
- and let's go find some rockets?
- I said shut the fuck...

1285
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:13,440
- You made the right choice.
- I decided I didn't want your child...

1286
01:47:13,560 --> 01:47:16,360
growing up
without a father.

1287
01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:19,320
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel I was your age.

1288
01:47:19,440 --> 01:47:22,440
So, I'm fucked either way.
So, come on.

1289
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:25,440
Weapon is hot. I am standing by
for the launch command.

1290
01:47:25,560 --> 01:47:28,280
Man, killing Navy SEALs
is one thing...

1291
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,800
- Is this for real?
- Hey, it's business.

1292
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:37,000
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1293
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:40,040
Launch coordinates:
Six, seven,

1294
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,280
five, four, five,
niner.

1295
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:49,880
The weapon is hot. I'm
standing by for launch command.

1296
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:51,960
That's affirmative.

1297
01:47:58,720 --> 01:48:01,160
Standing by for command.

1298
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:11,720
I'm waiting for
launch command, General.

1299
01:48:20,440 --> 01:48:22,720
- Fire.
- Fire!

1300
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,000
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1301
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:40,120
Origin: Alcatraz,
67253725.

1302
01:48:40,240 --> 01:48:44,240
- What's the goddam heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1303
01:48:44,360 --> 01:48:48,600
- Speed?
- Three hundred knots.
It's headed right at Oakland.

1304
01:48:48,720 --> 01:48:51,160
Football game.

1305
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,320
Oh, my God.

1306
01:49:18,320 --> 01:49:21,360
Missile radically
changing direction.

1307
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:30,880
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1308
01:49:32,320 --> 01:49:34,560
Oh, Christ!

1309
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:37,080
Missile losing altitude.
Falling.

1310
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:42,080
Falling, 300 feet,
200, 100.

1311
01:49:45,360 --> 01:49:48,200
Bogey detonated
under water.

1312
01:49:51,720 --> 01:49:52,640
What the fuck?

1313
01:49:52,760 --> 01:49:55,120
It missed.

1314
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:57,400
- Well, that's great.
- Extremely great.

1315
01:49:57,520 --> 01:49:59,760
But there's still
one left.

1316
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:03,520
What happened to the rocket?
What the fuck happened
to the coordinates?

1317
01:50:03,640 --> 01:50:07,160
What the fuck is going on?
Sir! Major!

1318
01:50:07,280 --> 01:50:10,240
- Captain, step outside.
- Talk to me, sir.

1319
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,280
Captain, step outside!

1320
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:28,000
Get me the Pentagon.

1321
01:50:42,120 --> 01:50:44,960
What the hell was that, Frank?

1322
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:48,240
- I said, what the hell...
- I heard what you said! If
you're gonna be insubordinate,

1323
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:51,880
- I'd appreciate it if you'd do
it with a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1324
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:53,880
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1325
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,000
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No!

1326
01:50:56,120 --> 01:50:59,160
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1327
01:50:59,280 --> 01:51:02,360
You're coming loose. The rest
of us are in complete control.

1328
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:05,400
- We're askin' 'em. We're askin'
'em for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1329
01:51:05,560 --> 01:51:07,360
- The men are falling apart.
- The men are Marines!

1330
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:11,080
Are they?

1331
01:51:11,200 --> 01:51:13,840
- I wanna talk to General Kramer.
- You've been asked by an old friend.

1332
01:51:13,960 --> 01:51:16,480
- Put him on the phone right now.
- You've been ordered
by a superior officer.

1333
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,520
- This is Major Baxter.
- Now you're being given your
last chance by a man with a gun.

1334
01:51:19,640 --> 01:51:22,040
Put the phone down.

1335
01:51:25,880 --> 01:51:28,560
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warmin' up.

1336
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,040
At ease.

1337
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:43,200
They need a decision,
Mr President.

1338
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:54,800
These past few hours...

1339
01:51:54,920 --> 01:51:58,720
<i>have been the longest,
darkest of my life.</i>

1340
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:02,920
<i>How does one weigh
human life?</i>

1341
01:52:03,040 --> 01:52:06,480
<i>One million civilians
against 81 hostages.</i>

1342
01:52:07,840 --> 01:52:09,880
And in the middle,
Frank Hummel.

1343
01:52:11,680 --> 01:52:16,240
That we have ignored,
abandoned or marginalized...

1344
01:52:16,360 --> 01:52:18,720
<i>a great soldier
like Frank Hummel,</i>

1345
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:23,760
and that American boys have paid
for that neglect in blood...

1346
01:52:23,880 --> 01:52:28,080
<i>is equally real
and equally tragic.</i>

1347
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,040
We are at war
with terror.

1348
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:36,440
<i>Fighting a war
means casualties.</i>

1349
01:52:36,560 --> 01:52:39,920
<i>This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.</i>

1350
01:52:44,240 --> 01:52:46,680
Air strike approved.

1351
01:52:49,840 --> 01:52:51,600
<i>Red Thunder to tower.
Request clearance.</i>

1352
01:52:53,400 --> 01:52:55,880
With the amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there,

1353
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,000
<i>- Tower this is Strike Leader.
Prepared to go.
- It'll be over in a few seconds.</i>

1354
01:52:59,120 --> 01:53:01,320
<i>Flight time to drop point:
17 minutes.</i>

1355
01:53:07,960 --> 01:53:12,720
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you,
but what the fuck is going on?

1356
01:53:12,840 --> 01:53:16,000
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?
- That's affirmative, Captain.

1357
01:53:16,120 --> 01:53:20,080
So, now they think we're
gutless, the Feds? They think
we won't actually do it.

1358
01:53:20,200 --> 01:53:23,080
They're gonna come at us
with everything they've got.
Air and sea.

1359
01:53:23,240 --> 01:53:27,360
- They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.
- They don't know we missed on purpose.

1360
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:33,160
Great. We're not gutless,
we're incompetent. That right?

1361
01:53:33,280 --> 01:53:37,120
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1362
01:53:37,240 --> 01:53:39,720
Load the V.X. Into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1363
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,800
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

1364
01:53:41,920 --> 01:53:45,360
Excuse me, General, but what
about the fucking money?

1365
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:47,960
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1366
01:53:48,080 --> 01:53:49,800
Bullshit it's over.

1367
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:53,440
You're talking to a general,
soldier. Maintain discipline.

1368
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:55,640
I'm not a soldier, Major.

1369
01:53:55,760 --> 01:54:00,440
The day we took hostages we became
mercenaries. And mercenaries get paid!

1370
01:54:00,560 --> 01:54:03,120
I want my fucking money!

1371
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:06,960
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1372
01:54:07,080 --> 01:54:11,120
I'm not about to kill 80,000
innocent people. Do you think
I'm out of my fucking mind?

1373
01:54:13,680 --> 01:54:16,160
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1374
01:54:20,640 --> 01:54:23,200
Whoever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1375
01:54:23,320 --> 01:54:25,200
Stand down, Captain.

1376
01:54:29,880 --> 01:54:32,120
Stand down, Captain!

1377
01:54:38,120 --> 01:54:41,000
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1378
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:48,080
- That's a simple order, Major!
- It's not so simple, Frank.

1379
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,640
Sergeant Crisp,

1380
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:53,520
secure the General.

1381
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:55,960
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1382
01:55:00,520 --> 01:55:02,520
Sergeant!

1383
01:55:09,520 --> 01:55:12,880
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1384
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:24,560
Major Baxter, you're either
with us or against us.

1385
01:55:30,280 --> 01:55:33,320
It has been the greatest honour
of my life to serve with you, General.

1386
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:41,160
But like he said,

1387
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:45,120
it's over.

1388
01:56:01,080 --> 01:56:03,200
Let's get him.

1389
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:10,920
Mason!

1390
01:56:13,600 --> 01:56:17,520
- My God, what have I done?
- Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket?

1391
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:23,520
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1392
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:26,320
- Lower lighthouse.
- Go!

1393
01:56:39,600 --> 01:56:42,480
Darrow, go to the lighthouse.
I'll take care of this fucker!

1394
01:56:48,760 --> 01:56:52,960
One, two, three!
Eat that!

1395
01:57:07,400 --> 01:57:08,840
Did it.

1396
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:44,360
Come here. Come here,
you little chicken shit!

1397
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:47,720
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1398
01:57:47,880 --> 01:57:50,080
Well, come on. Come on. Don't
be scared. I won't hurt ya.

1399
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:52,360
- Come on.
- Do you know how this shit works?

1400
01:57:52,480 --> 01:57:54,600
You know how
this shit works?

1401
01:57:58,680 --> 01:58:00,720
Come on. Come on.

1402
01:58:00,840 --> 01:58:02,880
I don't need the gun.
I'll put it down.

1403
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:07,320
Come on, let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1404
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:12,080
Listen, I think we got
started off on the wrong foot.
Stan Goodspeed, FBI. Uh...

1405
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:15,400
Let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1406
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:17,560
I don't like
soft-ass shit.

1407
01:58:17,680 --> 01:58:19,800
Oh, you... Oh, oh.
Oh.

1408
01:58:19,920 --> 01:58:23,880
Well, I only bring it up
because, uh, it's you.

1409
01:58:24,040 --> 01:58:26,520
You're the Rocket Man.

1410
01:58:28,200 --> 01:58:29,960
No!

1411
01:58:32,080 --> 01:58:36,240
- How do you like how that shit works?
- Second rocket's away!

1412
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,120
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1413
01:58:47,520 --> 01:58:49,880
Shit!

1414
01:59:09,880 --> 01:59:12,040
Darrow!

1415
01:59:12,160 --> 01:59:14,160
Open up!

1416
01:59:17,000 --> 01:59:18,600
Come on.

1417
01:59:18,760 --> 01:59:20,440
Open up!

1418
01:59:49,240 --> 01:59:52,000
Hey, you mother!

1419
02:00:25,560 --> 02:00:28,120
Oh, I'm gonna get you now,
baby.

1420
02:00:31,680 --> 02:00:34,280
Okay.

1421
02:00:36,400 --> 02:00:38,040
I got ya.
I got you, baby.

1422
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,640
Come on.

1423
02:00:57,800 --> 02:00:59,080
Fucker!

1424
02:01:25,800 --> 02:01:27,800
Red Thunder Strike Leader.

1425
02:01:27,920 --> 02:01:30,240
Time on target:
Seven minutes.

1426
02:01:47,560 --> 02:01:50,480
English prick. I tell you
my old man was Irish?

1427
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:56,120
Maintain air speed
450 knots.

1428
02:02:02,400 --> 02:02:04,480
Fuck!

1429
02:02:22,880 --> 02:02:24,920
It's me and you, pal.

1430
02:02:25,040 --> 02:02:27,480
I want that fucking chip!

1431
02:02:37,720 --> 02:02:39,760
I love pressure.

1432
02:02:47,040 --> 02:02:50,000
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1433
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:52,480
Now, pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1434
02:03:22,080 --> 02:03:24,440
Increase speed
to 500 knots.

1435
02:03:24,560 --> 02:03:27,280
You motherfucker!
Die!

1436
02:03:32,040 --> 02:03:36,000
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you. You're gonna die.

1437
02:03:36,120 --> 02:03:38,960
Eat that, you fuck!

1438
02:04:07,360 --> 02:04:09,840
All right, team, inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1439
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:18,880
Come to course heading
142 degrees.

1440
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:28,720
<i>When he neutralizes
the threat,</i>

1441
02:04:28,840 --> 02:04:31,920
<i>we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.</i>

1442
02:04:36,680 --> 02:04:40,360
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1443
02:04:40,480 --> 02:04:43,600
Please don't let this happen. There has
to be something you can do. Please.

1444
02:04:54,320 --> 02:04:57,320
Let's drop to the deck.
One hundred feet below radar.

1445
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:09,840
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1446
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:17,200
This is Red Thunder.
Master armed. Master armed.

1447
02:05:18,520 --> 02:05:21,040
Time on target:
12 seconds.

1448
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:26,640
<i>T.O. T:
Ten seconds.</i>

1449
02:05:30,800 --> 02:05:32,640
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1450
02:05:35,280 --> 02:05:37,400
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1451
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:40,840
This is C. Q, One, C. Q, One! Green smoke!
We have green smoke! Over.

1452
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:43,120
- Eh, gimme that! Gimme that! Abort!
- Abort!

1453
02:05:43,240 --> 02:05:45,960
<i>- Flight leader, abort, abort, abort!
- Jesus Chri...</i>

1454
02:05:48,200 --> 02:05:50,840
I already dropped them!

1455
02:05:59,880 --> 02:06:03,840
- Oh, goddam it!
- Oh, my God!

1456
02:06:06,600 --> 02:06:09,560
Get out of my way. Let me
through, please. Let me through!

1457
02:06:14,000 --> 02:06:17,920
The cells did not get hit.
The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1458
02:06:40,800 --> 02:06:45,880
I'm fed up saving your ass.
I'm amazed you ever got past puberty.

1459
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:50,040
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1460
02:06:50,160 --> 02:06:55,440
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.
Spend all my money on shrinks.

1461
02:06:56,640 --> 02:06:58,600
Goodspeed, come in.

1462
02:06:58,760 --> 02:07:01,920
Goodspeed, Goodspeed,
do you read me? Come in!

1463
02:07:02,040 --> 02:07:05,520
- Scanning all radio frequencies.
- Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in!

1464
02:07:07,720 --> 02:07:10,480
<i>Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!</i>

1465
02:07:15,720 --> 02:07:19,400
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in!

1466
02:07:19,520 --> 02:07:22,200
This is Goodspeed.

1467
02:07:23,880 --> 02:07:28,240
- Are the hostages alive?
- Every one of'em.

1468
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:33,840
Goodspeed, it's Womack.

1469
02:07:33,960 --> 02:07:36,640
<i>What about Mason?</i>

1470
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:46,160
<i>- He's dead, sir.
- How? When?</i>

1471
02:07:46,280 --> 02:07:48,920
Just come and get me.

1472
02:07:51,440 --> 02:07:54,600
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1473
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:57,440
But, of course.
I knew he would.

1474
02:07:57,560 --> 02:08:00,640
The S.D.U. S and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1475
02:08:00,760 --> 02:08:05,480
If you can get to the Pan
Pacific Hotel, there's clothes
in my closet, $200 in the Bible.

1476
02:08:05,600 --> 02:08:08,160
Room 26.

1477
02:08:08,280 --> 02:08:12,640
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1478
02:08:14,600 --> 02:08:17,840
But thank you.

1479
02:08:17,960 --> 02:08:23,800
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when we go
our separate ways, huh?

1480
02:08:23,920 --> 02:08:28,400
But, uh, I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name "Goodspeed."

1481
02:08:28,560 --> 02:08:32,680
Yeah, Godspeed: To wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1482
02:08:32,800 --> 02:08:36,520
Well, if you fancy
a journey,

1483
02:08:36,640 --> 02:08:39,560
I recommend
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1484
02:08:40,560 --> 02:08:42,760
I was thinking of Maui.

1485
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,120
No.

1486
02:08:48,680 --> 02:08:51,640
Forget Maui.

1487
02:08:57,040 --> 02:09:01,200
"St Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1488
02:09:01,320 --> 02:09:03,560
"Front pew, right leg.

1489
02:09:03,720 --> 02:09:06,520
Hollow."

1490
02:09:06,680 --> 02:09:09,320
Is this what I think it is?

1491
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:13,920
Mason?

1492
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:30,520
- Congratulations, Dr Goodspeed.
You did it.
- Thank you, sir.

1493
02:09:30,640 --> 02:09:33,440
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1494
02:09:33,560 --> 02:09:35,920
Well done, son.

1495
02:09:36,040 --> 02:09:37,640
So, where's Mason?

1496
02:09:37,760 --> 02:09:41,880
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1497
02:09:42,000 --> 02:09:44,280
Blown out to sea, huh?

1498
02:09:44,400 --> 02:09:46,840
Yeah.

1499
02:09:47,720 --> 02:09:51,960
Poor bastard.

1500
02:09:52,080 --> 02:09:57,040
Goodspeed, where's Mason? Where's his
body? I wanna see that son of a bitch!

1501
02:09:57,160 --> 02:10:00,760
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1502
02:10:00,880 --> 02:10:05,480
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1503
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:08,720
Oh, yeah!
Absolutely, sir.

1504
02:10:11,560 --> 02:10:15,640
St Michael's Church,
front pew, right leg.

1505
02:10:15,760 --> 02:10:17,640
Front pew, right leg.

1506
02:10:17,760 --> 02:10:19,760
Vandals! Vandals!

1507
02:10:19,920 --> 02:10:22,120
Oh, yes, baby, come on!

1508
02:10:22,240 --> 02:10:26,040
- Stop! Vandals! Stop!
- I'm sorry!

1509
02:10:26,160 --> 02:10:29,000
- Come on, baby!
- I've got it! Okay, let's go!

1510
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:32,360
- Stop! Stop!
- Sorry!

1511
02:10:34,120 --> 02:10:35,720
Stop! Hey, hey, you!

1512
02:10:37,760 --> 02:10:40,640
Vandals! Vandals!

1513
02:10:40,760 --> 02:10:45,760
Honey, uh, you wanna know
who really killed J.F.K.?

1514
