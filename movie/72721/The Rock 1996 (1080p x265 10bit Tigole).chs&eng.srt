47
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,130
卡萝不准  她认为花六百块来买张唱片是很蠢的事
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

48
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:37,540
没错  何不花十三块买张CD呢?
Carla's right. Why don't you just spend $13 on a CD, man?

49
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:39,810
一是因为我是披头四迷
First of all, it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

50
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,320

58
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:05,330
穿上防护衣

59
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,110

64
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:31,940
怀疑内藏沙林毒气

65
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,330
-毒气在-GB喷雾罐中
-Marvin, sarin is a...  -G.B. Aerosol.

66
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,060

里面有些色情杂志

赤裸原始美女

69
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,670
变态  这看来可不太妙
Kinky. And, uh... Not a good sign.

70
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:50,610
你好  小洋娃娃  你看  史丹利
Hello, little baby doll. Lookit, Stan.

71
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,250

-怎么了  史丹利?  -拿开!  拿开!
-Hi, Stan.  -Shit! Move back! Move back!

73
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,100
抽气
I want the exhaust.

74
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,930
五十秒后抽光毒气  你们不会有事的
Hang on, guys. We'll have that room clear in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

75
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,330
老天!

Okay, I've got some bad news and some really bad news.

77
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,610
坏消息是毒气有强烈腐蚀性  它正在腐蚀我们的防护衣
The bad news is that the gas is corrosive and it's eating our suits.

78
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,900
它侵蚀到我的手套了
It's all over my hand, man!

79
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,240
更糟的是...
The really bad news...

80
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:22,110
这里面的炸药和毒气足够...
is there's enough C-4 explosive and poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

81
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,620
把整栋大楼的人都宰掉
and kill everybody in the building.

82
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,290
爆炸会很猛烈  所有人离开检验室！

洒水装置怎么了  隆纳?
Where are the sprinklers, Lonner?

85

The acid's eating my su...It's eating my fucking suit! All right?

86
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,220

Shit!

87
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,500
洒水冲洗我们!
Just wash us off!

88
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:41,260
怎么不洒水?
Where are my sprinklers?

89
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:43,230
我们正在设法  水压有点问题
We're working on it. It's coming. It's just a flow problem.

90
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,500
这问题可严重了
Well, that's a pretty big friggin' problem, Lonner.

91

92
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:48,160
炸弹何时引爆?
We're working on it! How much time do you have on that detonator?

一分十秒后
A minute ten.

94
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,610
你看!
Look at this!

95
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,710
毒气就快被抽光了
We're gonna have the room clear.

96
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,200
叫他们立刻注射颠茄素
Tell 'em to take the atropine, now!

97
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,270
注射颠茄素
The atropine, Isherwood.

98
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,100

水怎么还不来?
Where's that water?

105
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,460
把它拿走!
Get that away from me!

106
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,660
快点菲尔  看在上帝的份上!  快弄好!
Come on, Phil, fix it for Christ's sake!

Take the atropine now, Stan, for Christ's sake!

108

毒剂开始混合了
The poison's mixing.

110

If that suit melts...If you die, we all die!

113

先注射解药再拆弹！
Inject your heart and then diffuse the bomb!

114

好吧  对我来说很有趣的一天
Yeah, I had kind of an interesting day myself.

135
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,350
好吧  你先说吧
Oh, okay, you go first.

136
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,910
恐怖份子寄出一个小包裹  盒装...
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send a little care package, box of goodies...

137
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:45,770
必须在它炸毁整栋大楼前拆除
which had to be neutralized before blowing up the office.

138
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,810
所以我下午请假
So I took the rest of the day off.

139
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,900
回家喝点酒  弹弹吉他  好好休息
Glass of wine, little guitar. Just relaxing.

140
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:56,490
甜心  这是个疯狂又危险的世界
-I mean it, honey. The world is being Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

141
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:59,670
谁要是选择在这时候生儿育女...
I really believe that anyone who's even thinking about having a child in this world...

142
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:02,660
那都是件残酷的事
is coldly considering an act of cruelty.

143
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,250
我在胡言乱语  对不起
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining. I'm sorry.

144
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,600
你有什么事?
What's your news, baby?

145
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,080
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

146
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,440
什么?
I'm sorry?

147
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:16,020
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

148
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:18,400
真的?
Really?

149
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:19,480
真的
Yeah.

150
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,800
哇!
Wow!

151
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:23,260
你只会说"哇"吗?
Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

152
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:24,800
你怀孕了?
You're pregnant?

153
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:25,820
三个礼拜
Three weeks.

154
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,730
你怎么知道?  我是说你怎么知道的?
How do you know? I mean, h-how do you know?

155
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:35,470
验孕剂显示出蓝色  我就去看医生了
Blue! Just turned blue so I went to the doctor.

156
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,250
你刚才说的不是认真的吧?
Well, you didn't mean what you just said, did you?

157
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,140
什么?
When?

158
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,770
你刚说生儿育女...
Uh, just right now when you were talking about bringing a child into the world...

159
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,970
是件残酷的事
and having it be an act of cruelty.

160
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,670
那是当时的念头
I meant it at the time.

161
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,710
史丹利  那是七秒前的事
Stanley, at the time? You said it seven and a half seconds ago.

162
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,380
天啊!
Well, gosh!

163
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,760
中间还发生很多事  我们甚至还没结婚呢
Kind of a lot's happened since then. Look, we're not even married.

164
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,420
真好笑  你正好提到重点
I know. It's funny you should mention that.

165
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,520
好笑?
It's funny?

166
00:13:58,230 --> 00:14:02,090
-你爱我吗?  -我当然爱你
-Do you love me?  -Of course I love you.

167
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,300
很好
Good.

168
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:08,330
你肯娶我吗?
Will you marry me?

169
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,210
慢点  别操之过急
Whoa! Whoa! Wai... Hey, Marriage Police, pull over!

170
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,950
别闹了  史丹利  我正在向你求婚呢
Come on, Stanley. I'm proposing to you right now.

171
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,630
恶魔岛是史上最有名也最恐怖的监狱
The Rock is the most famous and was the most feared prison ever built.

172
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,190
真的从来没有人能逃狱?
Is it really true that there's never been an escape?

173
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:35,500
没错  1936年直到1963年监狱关闭前...
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until '63 when the prison closed...

174
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,400
总共有十四次逃狱事件
there were 14 attempts.

175
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:43,170
没有人能够活着逃上岸
No one is believed to have made it to shore, alive at least.

176
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,620
这里不准游客进入
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry, but tourists are not allowed back here.

177
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,970
谁甩你  你管的着吗?
I don't really give a shit! Do you give a shit?

178
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:49,730
你们过来
Come here, fruity.

179
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,910
快点!
Move!

180
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,490
-小妹妹  玩的开心吗?  -开心
-Hey, girls? Hi. You all havin' a good time?  -Yeah.

181
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,210
帮我做件事好吗?
Will you do something for me?

182
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,280
这事很重要
It's really, it's really important.

183
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:03,500
我要你们去跟老师讲  请老师立刻带你们回船上
I need you to tell your teacher that you need to get back on the boat and go home right now.

184
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:05,890
各位  欢迎来到百老汇!
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Broadway!

185
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:07,990
这排囚室曾经关过...
This cell block housed...

186
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,230
美国最凶狠的匪徒

187
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,370
女士们先生们  我  警备员巴布...

189
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,140
当然  只是暂时的
temporarily, of course.

190
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:24,250
大家排好!
On the line!

191
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,310
挺狭窄的吧?
Pretty tight quarters, aren't they, huh?

192
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,990
就像笼中兽一般  被关在里面几年...
Like being a caged animal. Spend a couple of years in there...

193
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,110
怎么了?  玩的不开心吗?
What's the matter, fellas? Something wrong with the tour?

194
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,330
游览已经结束了  巴布
The tour's over, Bob.

195
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,870
这算什么鬼游览啊?
What kind of fucked-up tour is this?

196
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,930
汉默将军  费上尉和戴上尉报到

Land the choppers on the back side and deploy as planned.

199
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:10,080
-遵命  长官  -行动!
-Aye, aye, sir.  -Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

200
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,990
我没有佩枪许可
I'm not allowed to carry a gun.

201
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,290
你没有许可?  我有一把
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun? I got a goddamned gun.

202
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,220
早知道会这样  我就把枪带来了!
If I'd have known this was gonna happen, I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun!

203
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,700
救命!
Help!

204
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:23,110
好了  各位  这里是我们的新家了
All right, gentlemen, this'll be our new home.

205
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,230
我们在这里成立指挥中心
Tom, I want my command center right here.

206
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,490
-行动  -是  长官

卫星接收器摆在那儿  频率1600
Put the satellite over there. I wanna be up at 1600.

208
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,020
快
Let's move it.

209
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,610
系统启动
Systems up.

210
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,630
淋浴室有个地方可能被渗透
Possible penetration point in the shower room.

211
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,880
我们设置警告系统
We're setting anti-intrusion.

212
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,310
我带来个很特别的东西  长官
I brought a personal touch, sir.

213
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:01,230
一个震动侦测器
It's an anti-motion trembler device.

214
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,840
是特别订制的
It's custom-made.

215
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,830
没有人知道它的存在  更无法防范它
Nobody knows about it and nobody expects it.

216
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,680
它有什么用?
What's it do?

217
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,780
先用雷射光引诱敌人
We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

218
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:13,480
只要触动这个震动侦测器  他们就完了
And then if they disturb Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

219
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:32,470
各位被强制监禁在此  对此我感到很抱歉
Ladies and gentlemen, you're being detained against your will. For that, I apologize.

220
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,340
我们无意伤害你们
It is not our intention in any way to harm you.

221
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:38,820
只待我们的任务完成后  各位就会被立刻释放
You will not be detained one minute longer than is necessary for us to complete our mission.

222
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,680
立正!
Attention on deck!

223
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,060
各位请稍息
Stand easy, men.

224
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:56,370
毫无疑问我们正身处险境
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are now in harm's way.

225
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,070
我和巴少校在68年越战时就是同袍了
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last campaign in a career datin' back to Tet '68.

226
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,430
同样韩上尉和柯中士...
Likewise for Captain Hendrix, Gunnery Sergeant Crisp...

227
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,770
跟随我在波斯湾战争中开始了他们的军旅生涯
who cut their teeth under my command in Desert Storm.

228
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,070
而费上尉和戴上尉
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow, this is my first operational situation with you and your men.

229
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,550
这是我首次与你们共事  你们的表现的确名不虚传
And I have to say, thus far your conduct reflects your reputations.

230
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,660
-谢谢  将军  -谢谢  长官
-Thank you, General.  -Thank you, sir.

231
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:21,340
我们占领此地的的行动沉着准确又大胆
We have achieved our position through poise, precision and audacity.

232
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,430
因此我们更要下定决心
To this we must now add resolve.

233
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,820
我们会被视为叛国者  重罪者..
We'll be branded as traitors, the gravest capital crime...

234
00:18:26,830 --> 00:18:29,060
可能被判死刑
Punishable by death.

235
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:31,860
数百年前...
A couple hundred years ago...

236
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:35,080
华盛顿  杰佛逊等建国者...
a few guys named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

237
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:38,440
也被英国视为叛国者
were branded as traitors by the British.

238
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,350
现在他们则被视为爱国者
And now they're called patriots.

239
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,440
历史将还我们清白
In time, so shall we.

240
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:47,020
如情况许可...
God willing, in less than 48 hours...

241
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:52,950
凭人质和VX毒气弹头  我们将在48小时内撤离
you will evacuate this island in gunships under cover of hostages and V.X. Gas warheads.

242
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,940
你们的目的地是没有引渡条约的国家
Your destination: A non-extradition treaty country.

243
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,190
每人将获得一百万美元的酬金
You will each be paid a fee of $1 million for services rendered.

244
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,320
但你们永远不能再踏上故乡的土地
But you can never again set foot on your native soil.

245
00:19:05,330 --> 00:19:07,080
可以接受吗?
Can you live with that?

246
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,440
是  长官!
Yes, sir!

247
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,870
海军陆战队侦搜大队...
The men of Marine Force Recon...

248
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,570
被派往世界各地执行非法任务
are selected to carry out illegal operations throughout the world.

249
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,080
当他们战死异乡...
When they don't come home...

250
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,920
家人得到的只有谎言...
their families are told fairy tales about what happened to them...

251
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,830
没有任何补偿
and denied compensation.

252
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,410
这些谎言我已经忍受了一辈子!
Well, I have choked on these lies my entire career!

253
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,360
现在该是停止这些谎言了的时候了!
Well, here and now the lies stop!

254
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:40,860
上帝保佑你们  各就各位
God be with all of you. Man your positions, men.

255
00:19:40,870 --> 00:19:44,120
华府  七点四十分

256
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:47,160
我是联邦调查局局长沃麦
This is FBI Director Womack.

257
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,290
局长  请听清楚

258
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,630
有81名  我重复

259
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,670
目前有81名人质在我手上

260
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,650
目前有81名人质在我手上
81 civilians are under my control as of this moment.

261
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,990
请将此列为最高机密
You are to take measures to assure this remains a need-to-know classified fact.

262
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,500
你是谁?
Who is this?

263
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,410
局长先生  你面临一个很严重的问题
Mr. Director, you have a very serious problem.

264
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,160
VX毒气导弹如箭在弦...
A battery of V.X. Gas rockets is presently deployed...

265
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,540
准备对旧金山湾区发出致命的一击
to deliver a highly lethal strike on the population of the San Francisco Bay area.

266
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,880
午夜时我将再以电话通知提出要求
I will call again at 0100 hours to state my demands.

267
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,240
你是什么人?
I want to know who I'm talking to.

268
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:22,740
海军陆战队法兰斯汉默准将  从恶魔岛发话
This is Brigadier General Francis X. Hummel, United States Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

269
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,480
完毕!
Out!

270
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,890
我马上取消你的约会
I'll cancel your reservations.

271
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,420
联络五角大厦
Get the Pentagon.

272
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:33,290
通知旧金山办公室  看来恶魔岛又要开张了
And call the San Francisco office. It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

273
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,090
五角大厦  11点58分

274
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,720
昨晚汉默将军带领一群彪悍但无害的陆战队员...
Last night General Hummel, using brutal but nonlethal force...

275
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:42,630
在安全士官的眼前偷走十五枚VX毒气导弹
under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with 15 V.X. Poison gas rockets.

276
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,270
过程中他的一名手下丧生
He lost one of his own men in the process.

277
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,030
汉默将军在越南的时候还是上校
That's General Hummel in Vietnam. I think he was a major at the time.

278
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,780
他在越南参与过三次任务...
Three tours in...

279
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,740
巴拿马  格瑞那达  和波斯湾战争
Vietnam, Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

280
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,310
荣获三枚紫星勋章  两枚银星勋章...
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars...

281
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,150
还有国会荣誉勋章...
and the Congressional Medal of...

282
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,410
天啊!  这人是个英雄!
Jesus! This man is a hero!

283
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,050
我想"传奇英雄"应该是  比较恰当的形容词
Well, I think "legend" might be a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

284
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,560
我们可在他的英雄事迹上加上绑架和勒索了
Well, now we can add kidnapping and extortion to his list of accolades.

285
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:10,090
辛克莱先生  汉默将军是条好汉
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel is a man of honor.

286
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,390
将军  是他
General, it's him.

287
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,620
法兰克  我是艾尔克拉玛
Frank, it's Al Kramer.

288
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:19,150
嗨艾尔  你好吗?
Hi, Al, how you doin'?

289
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,870
我不晓得  法兰克  你说呢
I don't know, Frank. Ah, why don't you tell me.

290
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:25,100
我这里有一堆忧虑的傢伙  法兰克
Got a lot of very, very worried people here, Frank.

291
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,550
我就直说吧
I'll come straight to the point.

292
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:30,340
在我的指挥之下有83名陆战队员为国捐躯
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.

293
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,780
在寮国北部与中国南部牺牲了47名
Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China.

294
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:36,450
中国南部?  我们从未承认曾派兵到中国去
Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into China.

295
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,420
这是谁?  表明你的身份
Who is this? Identify yourself.

296
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,510
白宫幕僚长海顿·辛克莱
White House Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair, General.

297
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,500
你今年几岁?  海顿·辛克莱幕僚长
How old are you, Chief of Staff Sinclair?

298
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,790
我33岁
I'm 33.

299
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:50,490
那么辛克莱先生  你根本就不知道我在说什么
Well, Mr. Sinclair, you've probably got no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

300
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:53,680
你九岁时我就在中国从事秘密活动...
By your ninth birthday, I was runnin' black ops into China...

301
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:56,100
歼灭了两百名敌军
and my men were responsible f-for over 200 enemy kills.

302
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:59,040
拿胶带帖住辛克莱先生的嘴
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr. Sinclair's mouth.

303
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,470
他在浪费我的时间
He's wasting my time.

304
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,840
你想继续说吗  法兰克?
Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

305
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:04,910
记得波斯湾战争中
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

306
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,780
CNN播出的精准导弹攻击报导吗?
Those surgical hits made by our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

307
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,520
那是因为我的手下在地面用雷射瞄准了目标
It was my men on the ground that made those hits possible by lasing the targets.

308
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:17,080
战后有二十人在巴格达壮烈牺牲
Twenty of them were left to rot outside Baghdad after the conflict ended.

309
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,560
他们的家人没有得到补偿
No benefits were paid to their families.

310
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:23,230
也没有获得任何勋章
No medals conferred.

311
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,710
他们为国捐躯却得不到军方的葬礼
These men died for their country, and they weren't even given a goddamn military burial.

312
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:33,870
情况已让人忍无可忍  你们从红海贸易公司...
The situation is unacceptable. You will transfer $100 million...

313
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:37,810
将一亿美元的转入我指定的帐户
from the Grand Cayman Red Sea Trading Company account to an account I designate.

314
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,810
这笔款项之中...
From these funds, reparations of $1 million will be paid...

315
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,280
83名军人遗属将各得一百万元
to each of the 83 marines' families.

316
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,880
至于余款我则会妥善散发
The rest of the funds I will disperse at my discretion.

317
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,190
我说得够清楚吗?
Do I make myself clear?

318
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:52,630
红海贸易公司?  那是什么?
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that?

319
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,320
请表明身份
Identify yourself.

320
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,420
我是联邦调查局局长沃麦将军
This is FBI Director Womack, General.

321
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:59,430
那是五角大厦非法军售的地下基金
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

322
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:02,030
拜托  法兰克  这是最高机密
Jesus, Frank! This is classified information.

323
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:05,350
你们通知媒体  我就发射毒气导弹
You alert the media, I launch the gas.

324
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,050
你们拒不付钱  我也会发射毒气导弹
You refuse payment, I launch the gas.

325
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,650
到后天中午之前你们还有40小时把钱汇入
You've got 40 hours, 'til noon day after tomorrow to arrange transfer of the money.

326
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,650
我知道反制措施  你知  我也知  那一点也没用
I am aware of your countermeasure. You know and I know it doesn't stand a chance.

327
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,560
这是汉默从恶魔岛发话  通话完毕
Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

328
00:23:20,630 --> 00:23:25,500
我们必须查明人质的身份并分别通知他们的家属
All right. We have to identify the hostages and contact each of their families.

329
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,640
我要你们设法捏造理由  绝对不能泄密
Uh, tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story, and we've got to keep this undercover.

330
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:33,830
消息一旦泄露  旧金山将会一片混乱
If this comes out, the city of San Francisco will be in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

331
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:34,980
等等  等等
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

332
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:37,530
一枚VX毒气导弹...
What is the potential casualty rate...

333
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,240
潜在杀伤力有多大?
for a single rocket armed with V.X. Poison gas, General Peterson?

334
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,230
六至七吧
Sixty or seventy.

335
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:45,340
那还好嘛
Well, that's, that's not so bad.

336
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,890
单位是万  有七万人会死亡!
Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!

337
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,870
一汤匙毒气掉到地上  一百尺内人畜皆亡
One teaspoon of this hits the floor, it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

338
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:59,560
一汤匙毒气在空中引爆...
One teaspoon of this shit detonated in the atmosphere...

339
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,600
八条街以内的生物无一幸免
will kill every living organism in an eight-block radius.

340
00:24:02,670 --> 00:24:05,030
明白了吗?
Get the point?

341
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,660
汉默说的反制措施是指什么呢?
Uh, what did Hummel mean by your countermeasure, General?

342
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,940
汽油燃烧弹能够把一般毒气烧光
Standard poison is countered by napalm. It burns it up, consumes it upon detonation.

343
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:14,380
但VX毒气导弹的设计...
Now, the problem with V.X. Poison gas is...

344
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,040
却是能抵抗汽油燃烧弹
that it's designed specifically to withstand napalm.

345
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:20,450
因此才会发展铝热剂  将军  请您继续
That's where, uh, thermite plasma comes in. General Peterson?

346
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,620
铝热剂燃烧弹的热度够高  足以消耗VX毒气
Thermite plasma incendiary systems can burn hot enough to consume V.X...

347
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,250
但是还在测试之中  还不能投入使用
but they're still in the test phase; it's not operational.

348
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,590
汉默一清二楚  我们在跟一个聪明的混蛋打交道呢
Hummel knows this. We are dealing with one smart son of a bitch.

349
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,670
在36小时内能不能把铝热剂准备好?
What's it gonna take to equip a flight of F-18s with thermite plasma...within the next 36 hours?

350
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,000
只有靠上帝了
An act of God.

351
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,170
你说什么?
Excuse me?

352
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,030
我们尽力而为
All right, we can try.

353
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,810
不过我建议将此列为辅助对策
But I strongly urge you to consider the use of this as a secondary initiative.

354
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,870
那我们必须采取主要对策了  上将
Then we have to go to our primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

355
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,480
我要请特遣队队长安德逊来参与行动
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL ground commander, Commander Anderson.

356
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:59,290
沃麦先生  你们局里最顶尖的生化专家是谁?
Mr. Womack, who is your best chemical/biological man?

357
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,900
有意思
Oh, that's interesting. Oh, yeah.

358
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,360
很吸引人
That's very compelling.

359
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,170
你喜欢我的辫子吗?
You like my pigtails?

360
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,370
你的辫子很俏皮  很性感
Oh, yeah, the pigtails are very naughty.

361
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:20,710
意大利奶油和桃红点心
Naughty. Naughty. Just the Amaretto cream with peach sorbet persuasion.

362
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:21,620
不会吧
This isn't happening.

363
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:22,880
别接电话
No, Stan, don't answer it.

364
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,280
-不会这样吧!  -别去接
-This isn't happening!  -No, just don't answer it. It's okay.

365
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,180
我一定得接  他们知道我在家
I have to. It's the office, baby. They know I'm home.

366
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,950
他们怎么会知道你在家呢?
How could they possibly know that you're home?

367
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,250
他们是联邦调查局
It's the FBI.

368
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,820
史丹利!
Stanley!

369
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:41,160
我是古斯比  对好吧
Goodspeed. Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah.

370
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:43,530
我十分钟后就下楼
I'll be, I'll be down, yeah, downstairs in ten minutes.

371
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,330
不行
No, you won't.

372
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:48,930
我得去旧金山
I have to go to San Francisco.

373
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,500
不  你不能去
No, you don't.

374
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,120
史丹利你不必去旧金山
Stanley, no, you do not have to go to San Francisco.

375
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,820
你在跟我开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me right now?

376
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:57,680
你必须留下来  我们有些事要谈清楚
You need to stay here and talk to me about things.

377
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:59,820
我得走了  宝贝
I've got to go, baby.

378
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,680
我可是天主教徒  你明白这一点吗?
Oh! I am Catholic! Do you realize that?

379
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,350
我未婚怀孕  这对我来说问题可大了
I am pregnant and I am unmarried. And this causes a serious problem for me.

380
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,450
我真不能相信你
I cannot believe you.

381
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,370
不要
No, no.

382
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:24,840
我爱你  我会娶你
I love you. I will marry you.

383
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,640
我只是没有预期你会怀孕
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

384
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,050
-你也来旧金山吧  -真的吗?
-Come to San Francisco.  -Really?

385
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,610
是啊  我相信这只是演习
Yeah, I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

386
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:36,220
我们住旅馆  点些香槟喝
Check into the hotel. Order up some champagne.

387
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:38,310
-继续我们的游戏?  -没错
-And we'll finish what we started?  -Exactly.

388
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,150
-你会娶我吗?  -当然
-Baby, you're gonna marry me?  -You know it.

389
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:42,920
你要娶我!
You're gonna marry me!

390
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,830
-亲爱的  很快就好了  -我得走了
-Oh, honey, come on. Just a really quick one.  -Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

391
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:49,990
在月圆之夜空降是行不通的
A nighttime airdrop incursion is out due to the full moon.

392
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,000
同样抢滩攻击也不行
Likewise a frontal seaside attack.

393
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,260
如果我们被汉默发现  他会发射导弹的
If we're compromised and shots are fired, Hummel might launch.

394
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,170
唯一可行的方法是从监狱内部攻击
Our only alternative is an attack from within the prison.

395
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,670
我们从监狱底部的隧道潜入中央地区
We penetrate the island through the tunnels under the prison buildings undetected...

396
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,780
那样我们就能由后方突击那些陆战队员
and emerge in its center; that way we can jump the marines from behind.

397
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:05,850
如果幸运的话
And if we're lucky...

398
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,020
也许不必动武就能夺回导弹
take their rocket positions without a shot fired.

399
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:11,180
我想知道...你研究过建筑蓝图吗?
I don't understand. You-you've studied the architectural plans?

400
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,730
没用的  恶魔岛重新翻修过多次
They're useless. Alcatraz has been ripped up and rebuilt for years.

401
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:18,120
-地底下就像迷宫  -毫无疑问
-Under there is a maze of shit.  -Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

402
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:20,890
我们需要熟悉那些地道的专家
We need firsthand intelligence of the tunnel systems.

403
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:21,670
前任典狱长呢?
So what about the former warden?

404
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,690
一九七九年就死了
Died in 1979.

405
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,560
我们联络过其他的狱警  都没用
All the guards we contacted were useless.

406
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,630
我知道有人帮的上忙
Um, there is someone who I think can help us.

407
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,400
这是为了国家安全
This is for the sake of national security.

408
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,710
33年前就是为了国家安全才会这样做
It's the sake of national security that got us here in the first place 33 years ago.

409
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:43,620
我就知道有一天我们会被反咬一口
I knew! I knew someday this would come back to bite us.

410
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,700
想都别想!  他不存在
Forget it! He does not exist.

411
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,510
他存在!
He does exist!

412
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,720
三十年来我们只是选择把他忘掉
We just chose to forget him for 30 years.

413
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,720
-我们把他关起来  -然后让他永不见天日
-We locked him up and threw away the key.  -Oh, and a lot of goddamn good it did us.

414
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,000
他曾从两座高安全措施的监狱逃出来
He broke out of two maximum-security prisons.

415
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,250
如果被他逃到街上...
And if he hits the streets...

416
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,250
他不会逃到街上的
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

417
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,770
三十年前他确实是皇家特种部队的顶尖情报员
Thirty years ago he was a highly-trained SAS operative.

418
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,640
但现在他已跟我一样老了!
He is my age now, for Christ's sake!

419
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,610
我每晚还得爬起来上三次厕所呢
I have to get up three times a night to take a piss.

420
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:10,840
我们不能冒险放他出来
We can't risk letting him out.

421
00:28:10,850 --> 00:28:14,580
他是专业的逃狱专家
He's a professional escape artist.

422
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,520
"莎士比亚"  "孙子兵法"

423
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,020
真帅的飞机啊
Neat, neat plane.

424
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:53,020
古斯比博士  我是沃麦
Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

425
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:55,110
-幸会  长官  -欢迎
-A pleasure to meet you, sir.  -Welcome.

426
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,690
你的评价极高
You come very highly recommended.

427
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:00,590
哥伦比亚大学学士  约翰霍普金斯大学硕士  博士
B.A. Columbia; M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

428
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,050
生化毒物学博士
Biochemistry, toxicology.

429
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,700
很幸运  我热爱我的工作
Well, I'm one of those fortunate people who like my job, sir.

430
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:08,000
我七岁开始做化学实验  烧掉了自己的眉毛
Got my first chemistry set when I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

431
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:11,040
那只猫也此消失了  那时起就我爱上了这门学科
We never saw the cat again. Been into it ever since.

432
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,860
VX毒气你知道多少?
What do you know about V.X. Gas?

433
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:16,350
它是液态的  一九五二年除虫剂实验失败的产物
Liquid. Failed pesticide discovered by a mistake in 1952.

434
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,940
事实上就像香槟一样
Uh, actually, it's kind of like champagne that way.

435
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,680
修道士正在酿造白酒
The Franciscan monks thought they were making white wine.

436
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:21,880
无意中加入二氧化碳  然后香槟就诞生
Somehow the bottle carbonated. Voila! Champagne. And then the whole thing just...

437
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:24,410
VX毒气  古斯比博士
The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.

438
00:29:24,490 --> 00:29:26,750
十分可怕  长官
It's very, very horrible, sir.

439
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:29,230
那东西是不应该被发明出来的
It's one of those things we wish we could disinvent.

440
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,820
这不是演习
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

441
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:37,360
没错  古斯比博士  这不是演习
No, Dr. Goodspeed, it's not a training exercise.

442
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,460
三十九号码头

443
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:07,190
FBI活动指挥中心

444
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:16,530
早安  局长
Good morning, Director.

445
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,480
这是厄尼·派斯顿  联邦调查局西岸负责人
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge of the West Coast operation.

446
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,320
这是古斯比博士
Dr. Goodspeed.

447
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,180
幸会
Pleasure to meet you.

448
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:22,010
幸会  先生
How do you do, sir?

449
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,260
今天真是耐人寻味  犯人已经在这里了
It's been a fairly interesting day so far. The prisoner's here. Shall we?

450
00:30:26,270 --> 00:30:31,210
我的部下找不到他的档案  他到底是谁  长官?
Now, my boys, they haven't been able to find a file on this guy. Who is he anyway, sir?

451
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,290
他叫约翰·梅森  英国人...
His name is John Mason, a British national...

452
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,000
一九六二年被关进恶魔岛...
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962...

453
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,020
一九六三年逃狱
escaped in '63.

454
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:41,960
我以为没人能逃出恶魔岛  长官
I was under the impression that no one ever escaped Alcatraz, sir.

455
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,800
派斯顿  别顶嘴!
Paxton, don't argue!

456
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,500
这个人在美国和英国都没有身份
This man has no identity, not in the United States or Great Britain.

457
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,170
他不存在  懂吗?
He does not exist. Understand?

458
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,510
我只要知道他是怎么逃出恶魔岛的
I want one thing: How he escaped The Rock.

459
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,670
特别是他逃亡的路径
Specifically the route he took through the island's bowels.

460
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,300
文件准备好了
The papers are in order, sir.

461
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,820
我们准备完全赦免他
We're prepared to offer him a full pardon.

462
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:04,230
还有派斯顿  别对梅森来硬的  我太了解他了
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason. I know him too well.

463
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,360
既然你了解他  为何你不亲自去问他呢?
Well, if you know him, then why don't you question him?

464
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:12,130
他记得我  我不希望他的愤怒搞砸整件事
No, he'll remember me. I don't want his anger clouding the issue.

465
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,660
我搞定他吧
All right, I'll take care of him.

466
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:26,240
梅森先生  我是负责人厄尼·派斯顿
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

467
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:29,680
负责什么?  负责再多关我三十年?
In charge of what? Fucking me over for another three decades?

468
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,710
我不晓得你的过去  我之所以来此是因为...
I don't know anything about your previous matters. I'm here because...

469
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:37,190
我们面临一个特殊状况  我们认为你可能帮得上忙
a special situation exists that we feel you might be able to help us with.

470
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,530
那是什么?
Well, what might that be?

471
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,760
我被关得还比曼德拉还久
I've been in jail longer than Nelson Mandela.

472
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:43,090
也许你要我当总统?
So maybe you want me to run for president.

473
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:46,090
-不是  -可惜
-Not exactly.  -Mmm, a pity.

474
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,060
可惜  我好比阿格米达
I feel rather like Alcamenes.

475
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:53,540
-谁?  -阿格米达  在古希腊时代他被国王所囚禁
-Who?  -Alcamenes. He was imprisoned by his king in ancient Greece.

476
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:56,150
华特莱理爵士也有相同遭遇
Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.

477
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,370
詹姆士一世
James the First.

478
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:01,500
像你这样聪明的人该知道...
Even someone as bright as you must be aware that, uh...

479
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,880
历史会重演
there's a certain pattern emerging here.

480
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,020
还有亚历山大·索忍尼辛?
Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn?

481
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,490
我知道  他是为共产党摇旗呐喊的傢伙
Yeah, I heard of him. Didn't he play hockey for the fuckin' Red Wings?

482
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,630
就是他
That's the chap.

483
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:15,520
我们干脆挑明吧老兄  我们都看对方不顺眼
Get this straight, pops. I don't like you any more than you like me.

484
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:18,030
但我来此是要向你提出合理的条件
But I'm here to make you a legitimate offer.

485
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:20,330
你到底想不想听?
You wanna hear what I have to say or not?

486
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:25,100
尽管说吧  亲爱的派斯顿
By all means, dear Paxton. By all means.

487
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:27,540
我们在一个你所熟悉的地方遇到了麻烦
We got a problem in a place that I think you know.

488
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,440
恶魔岛上有人质危机
There's a hostage situation on Alcatraz.

489
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:34,040
-人质?  -81名观光客
-Hostage?  -Eighty-one tourists.

490
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:36,950
恶魔岛变成观光胜地?
The Rock has become a tourist attraction?

491
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,620
废话少说  你对恶魔岛瞭如指掌
Why don't we cut the shit, huh? You know The Rock.

492
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,800
你从那里逃过狱
You broke out.

493
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,950
对  我成功了
Yes, successfully.

494
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,110
只要你肯帮我们这个忙
Yeah. So why don't you do yourself a favor while you're helpin' us?

495
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:50,090
趁还活着赶快出狱多好
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail while you're still vertical.

496
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:53,360
趁你那话儿还有用的时候
Hmm? While you got a little lead left in your pencil.

497
00:32:55,770 --> 00:32:57,860
在我考虑条件期间...
While I'm considering your offer...

498
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:02,130
我要住进费蒙饭店的套房
I want a suite in the Fairmont Hotel.

499
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:05,430
我是来这里谈条件的
You know I'm here to cut you a deal.

500
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,210
我可不是来被你耍着玩的
I am not here to bend over and take it up the ass from you.

501
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,980
来  我给你个铜板
Here. Here's a quarter.

502
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,160
帮自己个忙吧
Do yourself a favor.

503
00:33:18,190 --> 00:33:21,060
打电话通知你的律师  你得回到牢里
Call your lawyer. You're goin' back to jail.

504
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:28,200
-你要把他送回监狱?  -我哪里都不送他去
-Y-You're sending him back to jail?  -I'm not sending him anywhere.

505
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,500
我只是要让他好好想想
I'm just givin' him somethin' to think about.

506
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:32,370
我们没时间...
With all due respect, sir, I don't think we have time...

507
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,800
让他坐下来仔细想
for him to just sit around and think about it.

508
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:36,770
-是吗?  -对  古斯比说的对
-Oh, really?  -No, Goodspeed's right.

509
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,890
-你去和他谈  -我?
-You go talk to him.  -Me?

510
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,400
对
Yes.

511
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:42,070
-长官  我还不够资格呢  -你是FBI探员!
-Sir, I'm not qualified for that.  -You're an FBI agent!

512
00:33:42,150 --> 00:33:45,620
-你的专长是什么?  -化学武器
-W-What is your specialty again?  -Chemical weapons.

513
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,080
这点提都别提!
Don't mention that!

514
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,180
-你要我说谎?  -没错  说谎
-You want me to lie?  -Yeah, lie.

515
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,960
我们剩不到二十四小时了  你就试试看吧
We got less than 24 hours. Give it a shot.

516
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,560
好吧
Okay.

517
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:12,940
我是联邦...
I'm an agent with the, uh, uh, F-Federal...

518
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,880
FBI的人
FBI. Uh...

519
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,650
我叫史丹利古斯比
Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.

520
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,150
当然
But of course you are.

521
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,310
至少他名字没说错
Well, at least he got his name right.

522
00:34:22,390 --> 00:34:23,960
我当然是
Of course I am. Huh.

523
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:26,200
你们有紧急状况
And you have an emergency.

524
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,630
是的
That's right.

525
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,400
你们需要我帮忙
And you need my help.

526
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:33,990
一点也没错
Exactly right.

527
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,530
-咖啡  -不用  我不喝  谢谢
-Coffee.  -No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

528
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,160
给我喝咖啡
Offer me coffee.

529
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:44,370
是的  我正要问...
Oh, yes! Well, that was, in fact, gonna be my next...

530
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:47,210
来杯咖啡好吗?
Can we get a cup of coffee in here, please?

531
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:52,040
再解开这些东西  梅森先生  真的
And offer to take these off. Mr. Mason, really.

532
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:56,350
表示你们的诚意
As a gesture of your good faith.

533
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:02,890
犯人要求把手铐解开
Prisoner requests to have his handcuffs taken off.

534
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,390
请你们解开他的手铐
Why don't you go ahead and have his handcuffs taken off, please?

535
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,200
我想这也是个办法
Well, I guess that's one way to go.

536
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,400
这是司法部长的赦免令
This is a pardon and release contract from the Attorney General's office.

537
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:20,540
只要愿意合作  你就可重获自由
Now, it makes you a free man provided you cooperate.

538
00:35:20,610 --> 00:35:23,980
如果你签名  就在上面写
So if you'll just, uh, sign...

539
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:26,920
签名的地方?
uh, at, uh, where it says..."Signature"?

540
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,540
没错
That's... Yes. "Signature."

541
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:34,450
拉丁文
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

542
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,590
我害怕希腊人  连他们送礼都得小心
"I fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."

543
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,820
你很有学问!
Oh, an educated man!

544
00:35:39,830 --> 00:35:45,460
看来你肯定不是实务探员
That rules out the possibility of you being a field agent.

545
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:48,440
老实说我是实务探员  梅森先生
In point of fact, I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

546
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:50,840
-真的吗?  -没错
-Really?  -Yes.

547
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,750
是哪个领域的?
In which field?

548
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,970
反恐怖行动
Antiterrorism.

549
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,780
你是武器  爆破和搏击专家
Then you're trained in weaponry, explosives and mortal combat.

550
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:02,780
训练精良
Well-trained.

551
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:05,820
带我到费蒙饭店
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

552
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,360
好吧
Okay.

553
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:13,360
我要住套房  洗澡  刮胡子
I want a suite, a shower, a shave...

554
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:15,330
还有一套西装
and the feel of a suit.

555
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,630
我可以建议你剪个头发吗?
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

556
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,000
这样不流行吗?
Am I out of style?

557
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,770
除非你是西雅图来的二十岁吉他手
Unless you're a 20-year-old guitarist from Seattle.

558
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,850
那是邋遢型
It's a grunge thing.

559
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,270
邋遢型?
Grunge?

560
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:28,440
好吧  谢谢你
Yeah, well, uh, uh... Okay, thank you very much.

561
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:31,400
好了  联络费蒙饭店  必要时封闭楼层
All right. Call the Fairmont. Close the floor if necessary.

562
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:32,820
我要他与外界隔离
But I want him sealed off.

563
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,240
给他最多两个钟头时间
And he gets two hours max.

564
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,140
干得好  古斯比
Great job, Goodspeed.

565
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,760
何不请他到大溪地度假?
Why didn't you throw in a trip to Tahiti while you were at it?

566
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,490
我把这要交给司法部
I'll deliver this to the Attorney General.

567
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:56,770
不  把它给我
Uh, no, you'll give it to me. Give it to me, Reynolds.

568
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,710
把雷诺律师带出去  外面有车在等你  谢谢
And take Attorney Reynolds outside. There's a car waiting for you. Thank you.

569
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:08,610
那是已签署的联邦文件  那样做是违法的吧?
That's a signed federal document, sir. Isn't that illegal?

570
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:11,210
你并不清楚实际状况  古斯比
You're not acquainted with the full facts, Goodspeed.

571
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,690
我需要解释  长官  我对他有过承诺
With all due respect, sir, I'd like clarification. I gave that man my word.

572
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,130
该死!  这是最高机密  你没必要知道
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.

573
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,830
我很好奇  但是
It's, uh, it's, eh, kind of curious, but, uh,

574
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:29,570
莱理爵士  阿格米达  索忍尼辛都受过冤狱
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamenes, Solzhenitsyn, they, um, well, they were all wrongfully imprisoned.

575
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,680
沃麦!  我就知道是你  你这混蛋!
Womack! Now, why am I not surprised, you piece of shit!

576
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,050
别动手!
Eh, peace! Peace!

577
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,900
没人在家  请留言
Hey, we're not home. Leave a message.

578
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,130
亲爱的  是我  听好
Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

579
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:03,860
别来旧金山  我重复一次  千万别来旧金山
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco. I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

580
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,500
史丹利  我一定要去的!
Stanley, no!

581
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,040
-卡拉  -我又不是没来过!
-Carla.  -Like hell I'm not coming!

582
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:09,580
等等  卡拉...
Wait. Car...

583
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,300
卡拉是谁?
Who's Carla?

584
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,750
你为什么不希望她来旧金山呢?
And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco?

585
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:26,930
这是最高机密  你没必要知道
You're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.

586
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,970
小心  他会咬人
Watch it, he'll bite you.

587
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:38,580
好
Good.

588
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:40,800
指挥中心一切就绪
Mobile Command is fully operational.

589
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,740
很好
Good. Mobile Command is fully operational.

590
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:43,470
我们两小时后到
We'll be there in approximately two hours.

591
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,540
我没有武器  长官
I'm not armed, sir.

592
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,520
我没有武器  长官?
I am unarmed, sir.

593
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,380
你的佩枪呢?
Well, where's your issue?

594
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:52,450
我放在袜柜里
I left it in my, uh, my sock drawer.

595
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:55,020
你要枪?
A gun?

596
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:59,220
要来干嘛  你只是个化学狂
For what? You're a chemical freak.

597
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,790
事实上我是个超级化学狂  但我还是需要一把枪
No, I'm a chemical super-freak, actually. But I still need a gun.

598
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:07,070
给他一把枪
Give him a goddamn gun.

599
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:12,140
毕业后你开过枪吗?
Have you fired one of those things since the Academy?

600
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,270
客房服务?
Uh, uh, room service?

601
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,800
这里是阁楼套房  你们有没有点心和饮料?
Ah, listen. This is the penthouse. Do you do snacks, drinks? Huh?

602
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:48,070
你好!
Hello!

603
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,480
-你是剃头师傅?  -不  叫我美发师
-You the barber?  -No. Stylist.

604
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:53,110
剃头师傅
Barber.

605
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,020
只准用推子  不准用剪刀
Just clippers. No scissors.

606
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,680
不准用剪刀?  你一定是在跟我开玩笑!
No scissors? You've got to be kidding me, no scissors!

607
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,460
你会叫毕加索  不准用画笔吗?
I mean, did they tell Picasso, "No brush"?

608
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:01,390
这个人能用剪刀杀人
With scissors, this man could kill you.

609
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:06,010
我用电动剪刀割不了任何人的鸟蛋吧?
I can't cut anyone's balls off with a trimmer now, can I?

610
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,430
咱们何不到阳台去晒点太阳
Why don't we do this outside? Get some sun.

611
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:15,800
谁帮你剪的头发  真是遭透了  逊毙了
Oh, who did this to you? This is just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

612
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,900
这是邋遢型
Well, it's a grunge thing.

613
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:19,970
的确很邋遢
Well, it's some kind of thing.

614
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,980
你想我们有没有时间能顺便护发和染发?
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp protein pack and maybe some color?

615
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,770
没有
No.

616
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:27,050
好吧
Okay.

617
00:40:27,090 --> 00:40:28,750
他脾气很大  对不?
Not very nice, is he?

618
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,310
没错
No, he's not.

619
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,770
有人点的  别浪费食物
Hey, somebody ordered it. Can't let it go to waste.

620
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,470
你嘴巴停不下来吗?
Don't you ever stop eatin'?

621
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,240
食物免费的时候例外
Not when it's free.

622
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:57,440
我们在执勤
We're supposed to be on duty.

623
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,050
别担心  他只是个老头子
Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

624
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,590
老板在看着他  来吃点龙虾
The boss is watchin' 'im. Come on. Have...Try some of this lobster.

625
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:07,020
我的秘书会跟你结帐
My secretary here will settle the bill.

626
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,420
办完事后你打算怎么处置我呢?  沃麦
So what do you have in store for me, Womack, when this is over?

627
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,360
你可以重获自由
You'll get your life back, Mason.

628
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:16,300
你早就可以让我重获自由
But you could've given me my life back years ago.

629
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,450
现在我为什么要相信你呢
Why should I trust you now?

630
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,030
我说话算话
You've got my word.

631
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,440
咱们握个手吧?
Will you shake on it?

632
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:42,280
别动  先生!
Freeze, mister!

633
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,090
救命啊
Help!

634
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:48,060
把枪放下  否则我就把你老大丢下去
Drop the gun, or I drop your boss.

635
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:51,330
你不会的!
You will not!

636
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,480
他越来越重了
He's getting very heavy.

637
00:41:54,510 --> 00:41:55,910
把他拉上来
Then pull him up.

638
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,410
别这样!
Please don't!

639
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:06,280
救命啊!  妈的!
Help! Shit!

640
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,110
来块干贝吧  来  接着
Come on. Have a scallop. Come on. Catch.

641
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:18,890
你来拉他!
You hoist him!

642
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,490
来人!  来人!
Help! Help! Help!

643
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,400
梅森呢?
Where's Mason? Where is Mason?

644
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:23,370
抓紧
Help! Hang on!

645
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,720
梅森呢?
Where's Mason?

646
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:26,400
-他逃走了!  -逃了?
-Mason's gone!  -Gone?

647
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,140
客厅没人!
Living room's clear!

648
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:37,070
天啊!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

649
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:40,480
所有人员注意  紧急情况  他还在饭店里!
All units, this is Caretaker. We have a Signal Six. He's in the hotel!

650
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,320
我什么都不知道
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'.

651

If only what? Six federal marshals hadn't kicked down our door...

怎样?  我们可以怎样?

你知道吗?  只有你能证明...我存在

00:53:56,390 --> 00:54:01,700
只要摸熟整个系统  你哪儿都能去
If you know the system, it will take you wherever you need to go.

这里有个水管入口  它低于水面
All right, there's an intake pipe here, below low tide.

757
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:05,700
那是我们最佳的入口吗?
Is that our best access?

758

00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:04,220
如果他不去  那我们放他出来干嘛?
If he's not going, then why the hell did we get him out of jail?

777
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:07,750
-他很聪明  -他只能指路  不能跟去
-He's smart.  -I got him out to get you people in, not go with you.

778
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,030
如果他是唯一清楚的人  他就得去了
If it's the only way of getting the intelligence I need, then he goes.

779
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,610
他会害你们

00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:35,950
并且拆除VX毒气弹
then neutralize the V.X. Chemical rounds.

786
00:55:36,030 --> 00:55:39,620
我们从卫星感热图看到导弹在停尸间...
Well, we know the poison's being kept in the prison morgue from the satellite thermal imaging...

787
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:42,130
就是这里  颜色变深的地方
which is right here; these colorized dots.

788
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:44,800
你看过真正的毒气导弹吗?
Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

789
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,670
不  我只研究过
No, sir, but I've studied them.

790
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,300
我该开始教你们如何拆除引信并解毒了
I should really begin briefing your guys on defusing and detoxification.

791
00:55:50,370 --> 00:55:53,040
这里有张图  是毒胶囊和导弹的结构详图
Got a really neat layout over here of the chem round as well as the rocket...

792
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:54,250
我们开始吧
So let's get rolling.

793
00:55:54,310 --> 00:55:55,440
没有必要
That won't be necessary.

794
00:55:57,850 --> 00:56:00,680
非常有必要
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

795
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:04,360
这种毒气的杀伤力惊人
The power of this chemical is way beyond anything you can imagine.

796
00:56:04,370 --> 00:56:06,280
会造成生态浩劫的
An ecological disaster, sir.

797
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:08,730
再加上它的设计相当复杂
Plus the devices themselves are complicated.

798
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,380
所以你得跟来
That's why you're coming with us.

799
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:18,430
-是吗?  -你是专家  有问题吗?
-I am?  -You're the expert. What's your problem?

800
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:23,200
我得跟去?  一起潜到水底?
You mean I'm going, going out there, under the water?

801
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:25,540
你今天早上不是要枪吗?
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.

802
00:56:25,610 --> 00:56:28,200
你现在有枪和潜水衣了
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

803
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,280
你参加过战斗吗?
Have you ever been in a combat situation?

804
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:31,900
请解释战斗的定义  先生
Define "combat," sir.

805
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:32,880
薜普?
Shep?

806
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,840
袭击在坚固碉堡内的海陆精英...
An incursion underwater to retake an impregnable fortress held by an elite team...

807
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,120
救出人质  夺回十五枚...
of U.S. Marines in possession of 81 hostages and 15 guided rockets...

808
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:43,290
毒气导弹
armed with V.X. Poisoned gas.

809
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:47,160
这么说来我没有参加过  失陪一下
Oh. In that case, no, sir. Excuse me.

810
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:55,540
-给  -谢谢
-Here.  -Ah, thank you.

811
00:56:58,310 --> 00:57:00,870
你脸色不太好
You don't look too good.

812
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:03,640
事实上简直是糟透了
In fact, you look like shit.

813
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:07,010
我的肚子在天翻地复
My stomach's doing hula hoops around my ass.

814
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,840
你没事吧?
You all right?

815
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:12,680
我是说  你办得到吗?
I mean, you gonna make it through this thing?

816
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,320
我不知道
I don't know.

817
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:18,090
我知道一定会面对这种事...
I always expected something like this was going to happen...

818
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,260
怎么准备都没用的
but nothing prepares you for it.

819
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,700
现在整个城市的命运...
Now I'm... I'm responsible...

820
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:24,740
都系在我的手中
for a whole city.

821
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,540
我知道这对你而言并不简单
Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

822
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,910
你受过这方面的训练...
Remember, you were trained for this kind of a situation...

823
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:34,030
相信我  你会想起来的
and believe me, it'll come back to you.

824
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:37,480
更何况还有全国最顶尖的特遣队协助你
Besides, you got the best SEAL team in the country backing you up.

825
00:57:37,550 --> 00:57:40,810
好吧  你说得对
Okay. You're right.

826
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:45,010
我会在无线电上指点你
I-I'll be on the wire. I'll help talk you through it.

827
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,920
还有一件事
There's something else.

828
00:57:47,990 --> 00:57:51,550
很糟糕  不  很美好
It's terrible. N-No, it's wonderful...

829
00:57:51,630 --> 00:57:54,100
现在却很糟糕
except it isn't.

830
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:57,460
我女友怀孕了...
My girlfriend's pregnant...

831
00:57:57,540 --> 00:58:01,440
她正飞来旧金山看我
and she's just flown in to see me.

832
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:04,270
你今晚尽管专心完成任务
You keep your mind on what you're going to be doing out there tonight.

833
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:19,560
我会派人把你女友接到指挥中心来的
And I'll send someone to pick up your girlfriend and bring her here to the command center.

834
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,780
汉默!
Hummel!

835
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,950
你好  法兰克  我是林斯壮
Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

836
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,830
克拉玛将军和我在白宫
I'm at the White House with General Kramer.

837
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,410
法兰克  我们在转帐时出了点问题
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few problems with the account transfer.

838
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,650
别啰唆  我要解决方法
Don't tell me problems. Tell me solutions.

839
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:34,970
我们跟总统谈过...
Now, we've spoken to the president...

840
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,380
你知道总统对恐怖行动的立场
and I know that you're well aware of his stance on terrorism.

841
00:58:38,390 --> 00:58:42,320
-所以我们打算...  -这不是恐怖行动  这是正义
-So what we'd like to do is...  -This isn't about terrorism. This is about justice.

842
00:58:42,330 --> 00:58:45,940
也是要提醒那些为政治理由遗弃他人的家伙
It's about reminding you people who found it politically convenient to forget.

843
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:48,150
这样说是没用的  法兰克
This is goin' nowhere, Frank.

844
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:49,800
让我告诉你吧
Well, then, let me tell you what is.

845
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,960
十五枚毒气弹将会击中旧金山市中心
Fifteen V.X. Gas rockets into the heart of San Francisco.

846
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:55,260
我给你十七小时去弄钱
You've got 17 hours to deliver the money.

847
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:57,960
否则后果将不堪设想  各位
Or be prepared to reap the whirlwind, gentlemen.

848
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,920
铝热剂好了吗?
What's the word from Mojave?

849
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,850
彼得森将军说不保证...
General Peterson can give us...

850
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:09,070
能起作用
no definite assurance on the thermite plasma.

851
00:59:09,140 --> 00:59:11,270
就这样了
That is the word.

852
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,870
派特遣队进攻
Green light to SEAL incursion.

853
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:24,790
距离时限十五小时

854
00:59:35,430 --> 00:59:39,460
集合!  好了  大伙听好
Fall in! All right, listen up.

855
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,330
梅森先生带头
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

856
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,730
薜普紧跟着他
Lieutenant Shepard will be attached to his hip.

857
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:47,830
你呼吸  他跟你一起  你想小便  他会帮忙
You breathe, he breathes with you. You piss, he helps.

858
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,040
懂了吗?
Understood?

859
00:59:50,110 --> 00:59:52,020
古斯博士是位专家
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.

860
00:59:52,030 --> 00:59:57,180
当他解除毒气导弹后  我们就发射绿色信号弹并等待救援
When he neutralizes the threat, we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry.

861
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:01,330
别怀疑各位  这是最艰巨的一战...
Make no mistake, gentlemen. We're in the fight of our lives...

862
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:06,660
对手是越战中最伟大的指挥官  我没有唬你们
against maybe the greatest battalion commander in the Vietnam War. I shit you not.

863
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,660
有问题吗?
Any questions?

864
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:12,400
出发!
Let's load up!

865
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:22,980
你先请  高手
After you, ace.

866
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:46,900
戴上迷你摄影机
Pass out and activate the minicams.

867
01:00:49,370 --> 01:00:53,310
一切就绪了吗?  摄影机启动了吗?
Everything set here? Minicams operational?

868
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:56,780
启动了长官  正在传讯中
Roger that, sir. We are on-line.

869
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:05,540
薜普  梅森先生有何装备?
Shep, what's the status on the special operational gear for Mr. Mason?

870
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:13,660
我看看  喷筒里装有一夸特燃油
Uh, let's see. We have, uh...one quart of kerosene in a squeeze bottle.

871
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:21,530
三个橡皮垫圈和防水火柴
Three washers and waterproof matches.

872
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:25,520
这是拆除导弹后要发射的绿色信号弹
Use the green flares to signal when the threat has been neutralized.

873
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:27,900
这是颠茄素  一但接触到毒气...
Now, this is atropine. If you come in contact with the gas...

874
01:01:27,910 --> 01:01:29,740
在二十秒内注射进心脏
you have 20 seconds to inject it into your heart.

875
01:01:29,810 --> 01:01:33,150
别迟疑  这能救命
Don't fuck with me on this. It may save your life.

876
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:39,810
锁定三架飞行物向此飞来  方位275
I have three incoming bogeys bearing 275.

877
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:42,320
距离  六千英尺
Range: 6,000 meters.

878
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:48,750
FBI指挥中心?
FBI Command Center?

879
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,720
你们可不可以告诉我  发生什么事了?
Oh, I would just love for you to tell me what is goin' on.

880
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:51,660
不行
Nope.

881
01:01:52,070 --> 01:01:53,350
听着  史丹利·古斯比是我的男朋友
Listen, Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.

882
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,440
实际上他是我的未婚夫
Actually, he's, um, my fiance.

883
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,810
-他人呢?  -这是机密  小姐
-Where is he?  -Classified, lady.

884
01:01:57,870 --> 01:02:01,250
好吧你就像个白痴坐在这里吧
Okay. Well, you just sit here and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

885
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,140
你上哪儿?  可恶!
Hey, where are you g... Goddamn it!

886
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:10,780
诱导直升机飞向恶魔岛
Decoy choppers commencing run to Alcatraz.

887
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:14,400
失去一架的踪影  我失去一架的踪迹
I just lost one, sir. I just lost one.

888
01:02:14,410 --> 01:02:16,950
两架正飞来  一架失去踪影
-We only got two flying in. I just lost one.

889
01:02:16,990 --> 01:02:17,980
可恶!
Shit!

890
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:32,270
以前我们只靠面罩和蛙鞋
In my day, we did it all with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

891
01:02:32,280 --> 01:02:33,000
以前?
Your day?

892
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,980
你不知道我的资历?
Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

893
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:38,570
我对你一无所知
I don't... I don't know anything about you.

894
01:02:38,650 --> 01:02:39,850
我对你略有所知  古人
Hmm. I know something about you, Godspell.

895
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:40,710
古斯比
Goodspeed.

896
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:44,340
古斯比  古人  古董...
Goodspeed, Godspeed, Godspell...

897
01:02:44,350 --> 01:02:47,680
你没受过反恐训练
you never went to any antiterrorist school.

898
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,690
你可千万别害我们送命了
So just make sure you don't get us all fucking killed.

899
01:02:52,930 --> 01:02:54,560
我们要下降了
We're goin' dark.

900
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:55,960
夜视镜!
Night vision!

901
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,700
突击一号正在金银岛附近...
Raider One has dropped below radar coverage...

902
01:03:00,770 --> 01:03:02,700
低飞躲避雷达侦测
heading around Treasure Island.

903
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:07,870
长官  有两架飞行物  正从东方接近中
Sir, we've got two bogeys bearing due east and closing.

904
01:03:13,220 --> 01:03:14,650
诱饵吗?
Decoys?

905
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,100
准备出发!
Prepare to deploy!

906
01:03:16,120 --> 01:03:17,420
祝好运  队长
Good luck, Commander.

907
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:24,760
突击一号到达目标区
Sir, Raider One is at the drop zone.

908
01:03:26,530 --> 01:03:30,260
史丹利不太会游泳  更别说是潜水了
Stanley's not a very good swimmer. I mean, he can't even snorkel.

909
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:32,820
大家准备好了吗?
Everyone, good to go?

910
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,120
准备完毕!
Good to go!

912
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:49,910
出发  队员潜入水中
All right, so the S.D.U. S have been deployed, and the Eagles are in the water.

913
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:02,130
少校  我要有人去巡逻西区
Major, I want the perimeter patrolled to the west end of the island.

914
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:04,360
-轮流巡视  -是长官  韩德!
-Double-time it.  -Yes, sir. Hendrix!

915
01:04:04,430 --> 01:04:06,460

-You lead the patrol.  -Aye, aye, sir.

916
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:08,590
快点!  快点!
Let's move. Move out! Move out! Move out!

917
01:05:04,830 --> 01:05:06,450
队员进入恶魔岛
The Eagles are on The Rock.

918
01:05:06,500 --> 01:05:08,290
他们进入贮水池了
They've entered the cistern room.

919
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,540
真是多谢了  梅森
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.

920
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:19,940
这地方根本没有出口
You've led us into a room with no exit.

921
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,520
有办法吗?
Any ideas, Dillinger?

922
01:05:24,550 --> 01:05:26,670
快点想  咱们现在是坐以待毙
Figure it out soon. We're sitting ducks.

923
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,840
我们时间不多
We're a little tight on time.

924
01:05:28,850 --> 01:05:31,770
你们在门边等着  等我把门打开
You stand by the door until I open it.

925
01:05:31,780 --> 01:05:35,190
我想知道你打算怎么开门呢?
I'd like to know how you plan on accomplishing that?

926
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,460
从这儿去
Through here.

927
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,650
你唬我
You're shitting me.

928
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,220
我还记得时间差
I memorized the timing.

929
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:50,200
希望没有改变
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

930
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:53,240
你要是被喷到你就成木炭了
You catch one of those flame bursts, you're a corpse.

931
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:53,680
谢谢
Thank you.

932
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,870
队长你叫我紧跟着他的...
Commander, you said never to leave his sight, but, uh...

933
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:58,700
留下来
Stand fast, Lieutenant.

934
01:05:59,050 --> 01:06:01,640
祝你们愉快
Have a nice day.

935
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:25,710
你们哪儿找来这傢伙的?
Where'd you dig up this guy?

936
01:06:25,740 --> 01:06:27,000
那是机密
That's classified.

937
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:38,090
这里没人长官  感应器也没有感应
Clear here, sir. No motion sensors tripped.

938
01:06:38,100 --> 01:06:40,420
没有动静
Nothing.

939
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,250
叫他们继续巡逻
Well, tell 'em to stay out there.

940
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:44,290
向前搜索!
Sweep forward!

941
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:55,820
看来他撇下我们了
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

942
01:06:55,830 --> 01:06:59,100
我就知道  那傢伙开溜了
I knew it. That son of a bitch jumped ship.

943
01:07:04,550 --> 01:07:06,480
欢迎光临恶魔岛
Welcome to The Rock.

944
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:24,060
-梅森  -不对
-Mason.  -That's a no-no.

945
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:25,200
那是地下道
That's the subway.

946
01:07:25,230 --> 01:07:27,230
那里才能进入隧道
That'll drop you into the tunnels.

947
01:07:27,470 --> 01:07:30,160
动手!
Do it!

948
01:07:45,990 --> 01:07:50,150
长官  队员进入地下隧道
Sir, the Eagles have breached the tunnel system.

949
01:07:55,660 --> 01:07:58,590
你很愉快吗?
You enjoying this?

950
01:07:58,600 --> 01:08:02,200
至少比牢里好多了
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable than my average day.

951
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:06,740
读读哲学  在厕所还得小心有人会强暴我
Reading philosophy, avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

952
01:08:06,750 --> 01:08:08,340
最近情况好多了
Though it's less of a problem these days.

953
01:08:08,350 --> 01:08:10,100
我人老珠黄了  也许没有吸引力了
Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

954
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:18,550
北边的防风栅栏有震动
We've got seismic activity in one of the storm grates. North side.

955
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:21,420
继续巡逻该区
Continue patrolling the area.

956
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,420
向前搜索!
Sweep forward!

957
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,920
慢着  有动静
Commander, halt. We've got movement.

958
01:08:28,230 --> 01:08:30,200
上头有声音
They're hearing sounds above, sir.

959
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,220
别动
Stand fast.

960
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:34,530
趴下  趴下
Down, down, down.

961
01:08:39,770 --> 01:08:42,400
西边防风栅栏安全
West storm drain's clear.

962
01:08:46,710 --> 01:08:50,480
离淋浴室只有97步
Ninety-seven paces to the shower room.

963
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,990
队员抵达隧道入口  就在淋浴室底下
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel. They're right under the shower room, sir.

964
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:07,930
光纤摄影机
Fiber optics.

965
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:11,720
有点不对
Something's not right.

966
01:09:11,770 --> 01:09:13,540
我有不好的预感
I got a bad feeling about this.

967
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:35,660
安静
Quiet.

968
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:48,430
动作感应器
Motion sensors.

969
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:49,730
雷射光横射过铁盖
Beams cutting across the manhole covers.

970
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:51,580
搞定它
Deal with it.

971
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:03,720
雷射光可能反射在棱镜上
Commander, the beam is hitting some sort of reflective device. Possibly a prism.

972
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:09,260
我要用镜子...
I want to use a mirror to cut the beam...

973
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:11,420
把雷射光折射回原点
send the beam back to its source.

974
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:12,930
然后我就移开棱镜
And then I'm gonna move the prism.

975
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:20,600
淋浴室的震动感应器有动静  长官
We've got motion on a trembler in the shower room, sir.

976
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:21,680
我们有客人了
We've got visitors.

977
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:22,700
走吧
Let's move.

978
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:28,710
好了  可以出去
Got it. Good to go.

979
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:33,750
-妈的!  我就知道!  -快点!
-Fuck, man! I knew this would happen! Fuck!  -Move!

980
01:10:33,820 --> 01:10:36,020
留下来  我们先清场
Stand fast. We'll secure the area.

981
01:10:46,930 --> 01:10:50,430
他们进入淋浴室了  长官
They're entering into the shower room, sir.

982
01:10:52,410 --> 01:10:55,600
他们正在清场
They're securing the area.

983
01:11:03,890 --> 01:11:06,790
别乱动
Just sit tight.

984
01:11:09,520 --> 01:11:11,750
放下武器!
Drop your weapons! Drop 'em!

985
01:11:11,760 --> 01:11:13,100
放下武器!  快点
Stand fast!

986
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:14,250
别开枪!
Hold your fire!

987
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,350
放下武器!
Drop your weapons!

988
01:11:15,400 --> 01:11:16,660
别开枪!
Hold your fire!

989
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:23,360
这是个陷阱
It's a fucking trap.

990
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,130
我是汉默准将
This is General Hummel.

991
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:27,050
放下武器
Drop your weapons.

992
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:28,230
放下!
Drop 'em!

993
01:11:29,010 --> 01:11:32,040
我是安德逊中校  汉默将军
Anderson here, General Hummel.

994
01:11:32,050 --> 01:11:34,710
特遣队队长
Commander. Team leader.

995
01:11:34,780 --> 01:11:37,770
安德逊中校  如果你爱惜兄弟性命
Commander Anderson, if you have any concern for the lives of your men...

996
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:40,910
你就命令他们放下武器
you will order them to safety their weapons and place them on the deck.

997
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:42,890
糟了
This is not happening.

998
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,750
我们知道你的目的
Sir, we know why you're out here.

999
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:48,860
我也完全同意你
God knows I agree with you.

1000
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:52,200
但我也跟你一样立誓捍卫祖国抵挡敌人...
But like you, I swore to defend this country against all enemies...

1001
01:11:52,270 --> 01:11:56,760
不论他们是外国人或是本国人
foreign, sir, and domestic.

1002
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:00,650
将军  我们都为这国家洒下热血
General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud.

1003
01:12:00,660 --> 01:12:03,980
你知道我不能下达这个命令
You know goddamn well I can't give that order.

1004
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:05,160
我们死定了
We're dead.

1005
01:12:05,170 --> 01:12:08,970
我们居高临下  中校
Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.

1006
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:12,980
我不会再要求你了  别做傻事
I'm not gonna ask you again. Don't do anything stupid.

1007
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:15,020
没有人需要死在这里
No one has to die here.

1008
01:12:15,030 --> 01:12:20,030
你们这些人  你们在海军陆战队誓言效忠国家!
Men following the general, you're under oath as United States Marines!

1009
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:23,150
你们忘了吗?
Have you forgotten that?

1010
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:25,410
我们都有袍泽丧命战场
We all have shipmates we remember.

1011
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:28,440
有些甚至是被五角大厦的人所遗弃
Some of them were shit on and pissed on by the Pentagon.

1012
01:12:28,450 --> 01:12:30,750
但你们也无权叛变啊!
But that doesn't give you the right to mutiny!

1013
01:12:30,810 --> 01:12:32,930
随你怎么说  我们占了优势
You call it what you want!

1014
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:36,390
你们犯了大错  中校
You're down there, we're up here. You walked into the wrong goddamn room, Commander!

1015
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,150
-别动!  -该死  中校  最后一次
-Stand fast!  -Goddamn it, Commander, one last time.

1016
01:12:39,210 --> 01:12:41,430
命令你的手下放下武器
You tell your men to safety their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

1017
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,180
-我无法下达那个命令!  -我不想再说一次
-I cannot give that order!  -I am not gonna repeat that order!

1018
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:46,990
-我无法下达那个命令  -你是怎么了?
-I will not give that order!  -What the hell is wrong with you, man?

1019
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,850
-别动!  -别动!
-Stand fast!  -Oh, my God!

1020
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:53,420
-我再说一次-我们干掉他们吧...
-Let's waste these fuckers.  -One last time. You order your men to safety their weapons...

1021
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:02,960
停火!
Cease fire!

1022
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:24,650
别去
Don't go.

1023
01:13:25,930 --> 01:13:28,500
停火!
Cease fire!

1024
01:13:36,840 --> 01:13:39,310
停火!
Cease fire!

1025
01:13:39,370 --> 01:13:41,530
该死!  可恶!
Shit! Goddamn it!

1026
01:13:41,610 --> 01:13:44,010
放开我  放开我!
Let go of me. Let go of me!

1027
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,210
别去
Don't. Don't go.

1028
01:14:34,530 --> 01:14:37,260
完了
It's over.

1029
01:14:46,510 --> 01:14:49,100
天啊!
Oh, God!

1030
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:21,850
-还有动静  -谁?
-We got some movement.  -Who?

1031
01:15:21,880 --> 01:15:22,710
两个人!
Two of 'em!

1032
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:23,860
是谁?
Who is it?

1033
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:24,950
11  12号
Eagles 11 and 12.

1034
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:25,850
古斯比和梅森
L-lt's Goodspeed and Mason.

1035
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:27,010
我就知道
I knew it.

1036
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:30,510
我们得尽快组成第二队  再次行动
I've gotta get a team together right now. We've gotta move with the second option.

1037
01:15:30,590 --> 01:15:33,140
让他们再被屠杀?  不行
What, and invite another massacre? No way.

1038
01:15:33,150 --> 01:15:37,720
只剩一只老狐狸和菜鸟  我告诉你  没戏唱了
We've got a 60-year-old convict and a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

1039
01:15:37,790 --> 01:15:39,950
梅森还没玩完  不是吗?
Not for Mason, it isn't.

1040
01:15:51,170 --> 01:15:55,500
古斯比  我不会杀你的
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

1041
01:15:57,480 --> 01:15:59,000
你上哪儿?
Where are you going?

1042
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:00,240
离开此地
Off this bloody island.

1043
01:16:00,350 --> 01:16:02,440
为什么?
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

1044
01:16:02,450 --> 01:16:06,880
古斯比?  古斯比  你收到吗?
Goodspeed. Goodspeed, do you read me?

1045
01:16:06,890 --> 01:16:09,360
找你的
It's for you.

1046
01:16:09,890 --> 01:16:11,120
长官?
Sir?

1047
01:16:11,160 --> 01:16:12,420
情况如何?
What's the status?

1048
01:16:13,030 --> 01:16:15,830
他们死了  全死了!
The status is they're dead. They're dead!

1049
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:17,960
只剩我和梅森  梅森正要走
It's just me and Mason. Now he says he's leaving.

1050
01:16:18,030 --> 01:16:22,370
不行  听到吗?  不行!
That is unacceptable. Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

1051
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:25,350
有点麻烦  长官  他手上有枪
Well, there's a problem, sir. He's got a gun.

1052
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,600
你只有水枪吗?
What do you have, a fuckin' water pistol?

1053
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,300
不是
No, sir.

1054
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:31,070
去阻止他
Go after him and stop him.

1055
01:16:32,610 --> 01:16:34,920
我不想这样
I didn't want this.

1056
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:36,320
天啊  我并不想这样
Jesus, I didn't want this.

1057
01:16:36,350 --> 01:16:37,510
这是无可避免的  法兰克
You knew this might happen, Frank.

1058
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:41,350
-也许他们会付钱给我们  -也许不会
-Well, maybe now they'll pay up.  -Maybe now they won't, Captain.

1059
01:16:41,420 --> 01:16:43,890
也许我们该处决一些人质
Then maybe we need to execute a few hostages.

1060
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,900
有一个活口!
Got a live one!

1061
01:16:44,930 --> 01:16:46,260
打死他
Put a bullet in him.

1062
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:48,400
你听到了  解决他!
You heard him. End it!

1063
01:16:48,430 --> 01:16:50,130
收起手枪
Holster that sidearm, Captain.

1064
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,320
长官?
Sir?

1065
01:17:14,220 --> 01:17:17,260
你犯了大错
You made a terrible mistake.

1066
01:17:17,330 --> 01:17:20,590
害他们白白牺牲
And more of our brothers have died in vain.

1067
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,790
是你们逼我的
Damn you for forcing me into this position.

1068
01:17:26,230 --> 01:17:29,860
我现在就要单独跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you right now, alone.

1069
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:31,840
你说这是最高机密
Now you told me I'm on a need-to-know basis.

1070
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,200
我现在告诉你
And I'm tellin' you right now.

1071
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:36,440
我要知道约翰·梅森的身份  长官
I need to know who the fuck John Mason is right now, sir.

1072
01:17:37,180 --> 01:17:39,280
你真的想知道?
All right, you wanna know?

1073
01:17:39,310 --> 01:17:42,020
一九六二年  胡佛...
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

1074
01:17:42,050 --> 01:17:42,930
掌管调查局
is head of the FBI.

1075
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,210
有人说他控管了整个国家
Some say the country.

1076
01:17:44,350 --> 01:17:48,740
他秘密调查美国和欧洲的政要
It's no secret he kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans:

1077
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:52,550
戴高乐  英国议员和首相
De Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the prime minister.

1078
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:55,460
他有每个人的秘密档案
I mean, this guy had dirt on everybody in the world.

1079
01:17:55,470 --> 01:17:59,690
我听过传闻  这和梅森又有何关系?
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger stories. Where does Mason fit in?

1080
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:02,360
他就是偷走档案的英国间谍
Mason was the British operative who stole the files.

1081
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:05,500
但我们在加拿大边界逮到他
But our Bureau agents caught him at the Canadian border.

1082
01:18:05,510 --> 01:18:08,610
当然英国不承认他的身份
Of course, the British claimed they'd never heard of him.

1083
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,650
我们将他囚禁...
And we held him without trial...

1084
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:13,520
逼他交出胶片
until he gave up the microfilm.

1085
01:18:13,550 --> 01:18:14,710
但是他没有交出来
But he never did.

1086
01:18:15,180 --> 01:18:17,950
真令人讶异  胡佛没用他女儿逼他
Well, I'm surprised Hoover didn't use his daughter as leverage.

1087
01:18:18,020 --> 01:18:21,320
胡佛于一九七二年去世  那时她还没出世
Hoover was dead in '72. She wasn't born yet.

1088
01:18:21,330 --> 01:18:25,020
现在的调查局不同了
Today, well, it's a different Bureau.

1089
01:18:25,090 --> 01:18:27,560
他被关了一辈子!  没有任何公平的审判
So you held this guy without trial his whole life!

1090
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:28,720
也难怪他会生气
No wonder he's pissed.

1091
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:33,920
他知道美国半个世纪以来埋藏最深的秘密
This man knows our most intimate secrets from the last half century:

1092
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:38,210
外星人登陆  刺杀肯尼迪的真凶
The alien landing at Roswell, the truth about the J.F.K. Assassination.

1093
01:18:38,220 --> 01:18:42,140
梅森很生气  梅森很危险  他是个职业杀手
And Mason's angry, he's lethal, he's a trained killer.

1094
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:47,810
而他也是我们手上唯一的希望
And he is the only hope that we have got.

1095
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:50,850
梅森!  梅森!
Mason! Mason!

1096
01:18:52,950 --> 01:18:55,420
上面有81名人质
There are 81 hostages still up there.

1097
01:18:55,430 --> 01:18:57,320
是啊  我也是人质
Yeah, like me.

1098
01:18:57,390 --> 01:18:58,540
你想来硬的?
All right, you wanna play tough?

1099
01:18:58,590 --> 01:18:59,580
你想跟我来硬的?
You wanna play tough with me?

1100
01:19:00,130 --> 01:19:00,830
好  FBI!
Okay. FBI!

1101
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:02,190
别动  浑蛋!
Freeze, sucker!

1102
01:19:04,370 --> 01:19:06,850
我会开枪的
I'll fire.

1103
01:19:06,900 --> 01:19:08,030
不  你不会
No, you won't.

1104
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:11,200
放下枪
Throw down.

1105
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:12,900
你不是那种人
You're not the sort.

1106
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:15,840
我们等着瞧吧
Let's find out.

1107
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:21,570
我是  你不是
I could; you, no.

1108
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:24,720
而且你保险没开
Besides, your safety's on.

1109
01:19:24,790 --> 01:19:28,420
古斯比  你的情况解决了吗?
Goodspeed, have you resolved the situation?

1110
01:19:29,890 --> 01:19:33,490
还没有
Not yet.

1111
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:36,190
-现在枪都在他手上了  -该死!
-He's got all the guns now, sir.  -Shit!

1112
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:39,590
没错  我不用枪  我也不会踹门
You're right, I don't use guns and I don't kick down doors.

1113
01:19:39,670 --> 01:19:40,800
这才是我在做的事
This is what I do.

1114
01:19:40,840 --> 01:19:42,430
我没戴眼镜
I haven't got my glasses.

1115
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:46,430
上面写  化学武器专家
What it says is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

1116
01:19:46,440 --> 01:19:49,490
没错
That's right. I got a lunatic up there, man...

1117
01:19:49,500 --> 01:19:54,540
上面那疯子有十五枚致命的毒气导弹
with 15 missiles armed with some really funky stuff.

1118
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:58,910
沃麦这大骗子  你可以警告我女儿的
That lying Womack. You could've told my daughter.

1119
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:03,520
那是机密  我也面临相同的状况
It was classified. Look, I'm in the same situation.

1120
01:20:03,530 --> 01:20:07,360
我怀孕的女友也在旧金山
They've got my girlfriend in the city with a baby on the way.

1121
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:11,560
我能拆除导弹  我真的可以
Look, I can defuse the rockets. I really can.

1122
01:20:11,630 --> 01:20:13,690
不过我需要你的帮忙  就现在
But I'm gonna need your help, and I'm gonna need it right now.

1123
01:20:21,710 --> 01:20:24,880
长官  他的武器和通话机不见了!
Sir, this man's weapons and tack radio are missing!

1124
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:27,720
该死  有鼠辈横行  把他们揪出来
Shit, we got a rodent problem. Flush the pipes.

1125
01:20:27,730 --> 01:20:31,850
底下的隧道像迷宫  仔细搜
There's probably a maze of tunnels on this goddamn island. Check every access you can find.

1126
01:20:38,930 --> 01:20:45,500
就算你逃出恶魔岛...也躲不过导弹的
Even if you escape from the island...you can't escape the rockets.

1127
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:46,850
你打算逃到哪儿?
So, where are you gonna go?

1128
01:20:46,900 --> 01:20:48,560
去哪?  做什么?
Go where? What are, what are you gonna do?

1129
01:20:53,210 --> 01:20:54,450
告诉我停尸间在哪儿  梅森
Show me where the morgue is, Mason.

1130
01:20:54,510 --> 01:20:56,240
我要出去了
I'm out of here.

1131
01:20:59,810 --> 01:21:02,480
你不管你的女儿吗?  梅森?
What about your daughter? Mason?

1132
01:21:04,690 --> 01:21:07,210
找到了
Rodents located.

1133
01:21:07,290 --> 01:21:11,590
我看你别无选择  对吧?
The way I see it, you don't really have any choice, do you?

1134
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,030
我不认为你有
I don't think you do.

1135
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:27,170
快跑!
Move!

1136
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,820
他们盯上我们了
They're onto us.

1137
01:21:52,830 --> 01:21:55,670
用火把他们烧出来
Burn 'em out.

1138
01:21:57,310 --> 01:22:00,100
这玩意可厉害了
This mother's gonna blow big.

1139
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:45,060
我不了解  怎么会突然失去通讯?
I don't understand. How could we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1140
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:47,910
我们失去通讯了  但雷达还有显示
We've lost coms. Still got 'em on locaters.

1141
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:57,560
你怎么说?
So what's it gonna be?

1142
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:58,690
什么?
What?

1143
01:22:59,100 --> 01:23:02,560
你有别的选择吗?
How do you like your choices?

1144
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:03,600
没有
I don't.

1145
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:04,870
所以说
That's what I thought.

1146
01:23:06,310 --> 01:23:09,030
来吧
All right, come on.

1147
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:12,980
这是恶魔岛最古老的地方
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1148
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:15,920
这原来是美国内战的碉堡
Did you know it was originally a Civil War fort?

1149
01:23:15,980 --> 01:23:17,140
真的吗?
Oh, really?

1150
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:18,350
你知道吗  我也喜欢历史...
Huh. Yeah, wow. You know, I like history, too...

1151
01:23:18,520 --> 01:23:23,170
也许这一切结束后  咱们再来研究
and maybe when this is all over, you and I can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1152
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:26,720
不过现在我只想...找到导弹
But right now I just... I just... I wanna find some rockets.

1153
01:23:27,330 --> 01:23:32,830
别惹火我  我们正要去停尸间
Don't tempt me. We are going to the morgue.

1154
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:57,400
你可以吗?
You sure you're ready for this?

1155
01:23:57,430 --> 01:23:58,830
我会尽力而为
I'll do my best.

1156
01:23:59,730 --> 01:24:02,120
尽力而为?
Your best?

1157
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:06,070
输家总是抱怨他们已经尽力了
Losers always whine about their best.

1158
01:24:06,130 --> 01:24:09,070
赢家才能搞上选美皇后
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.

1159
01:24:10,540 --> 01:24:12,470
卡拉是选美皇后
Carla was the prom queen.

1160
01:24:12,540 --> 01:24:14,450
真的吗?
Really?

1161
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:15,500
真的
Yeah.

1162
01:24:17,780 --> 01:24:20,750
雷达显示他们接近停尸间
Locaters have them approaching the morgue, sir.

1163
01:24:20,820 --> 01:24:23,340
加油  你办得到的
Come on, come on. You can do it, Doc.

1164
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,420
千万别迟疑
You must never hesitate.

1165
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:59,980
你差点射到导弹
I think you're shooting too close to the rocket.

1166
01:25:00,060 --> 01:25:01,890
别射到导弹
Him, but not the rocket.

1167
01:25:01,900 --> 01:25:04,290
还有什么吩咐吗教授?
Any other news, Professor?

1168
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:07,750
别射到导弹!
Not the rocket!

1169
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:09,830
别射到导弹
Not the rocket.

1170
01:25:25,310 --> 01:25:27,680
我要让你们好看
I got a little somethin' for ya.

1171
01:25:49,970 --> 01:25:54,070
这是我见过死的最惨的人
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1172
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,780
梅森...
Mason...

1173
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,440
一不小心  你就会送命
the second you don't respect this, it kills you.

1174
01:26:02,450 --> 01:26:04,610
放过去
Put it over there.

1175
01:26:15,300 --> 01:26:18,060
你看过尸体  那样算是正常的吗?
You've been around a lot of corpses. Is that normal?

1176
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:21,390
-脚在抖?  -对  就是脚在抖
-What, the feet thing?  -Yeah, the feet thing.

1177
01:26:21,470 --> 01:26:22,450
那很正常
Yeah, that happens.

1178
01:26:22,500 --> 01:26:24,780
那让我集中不了精神
Well, I'm having kind of a hard time concentrating.

1179
01:26:24,810 --> 01:26:26,200
你能想点办法吗?
Can you do something about it?

1180
01:26:26,240 --> 01:26:28,070
要怎样?  再杀死他一次吗?
Well, like what? Kill him again?

1181
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:31,780
听着  我只是个生化专家
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1182
01:26:31,850 --> 01:26:35,920
成天关在实验室  生活平淡
And most of the time I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1183
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:39,900
开着棕色的富豪车  不过我现在要处理的是...
I drive a Volvo, a beige one. But what I'm dealing with here...

1184
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:42,980
这世上最致命的物质
is one of the most deadly substances the Earth has ever known.

1185
01:26:43,060 --> 01:26:45,750
所以拜托你别惹我
So what do you say you cut me some friggin' slack?

1186
01:27:02,110 --> 01:27:04,640
一串串相当晶莹剔透
A really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.

1187
01:27:04,650 --> 01:27:06,910
但不幸的是它们非常不稳定
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

1188
01:27:06,980 --> 01:27:08,800
这东西能有什么作用?
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

1189
01:27:08,810 --> 01:27:12,380
导弹将之汽化后能够杀死一整个城市的居民
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can take out the entire city of people.

1190
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,800
真的吗?
Really?

1191
01:27:15,820 --> 01:27:17,090
如果你掉下一个呢?
And what happens if you drop one?

1192
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:21,200
很幸运地只会杀死我们俩
Happily, it'll just wipe out you and me.

1193
01:27:21,230 --> 01:27:21,850
怎么杀?
How?

1194
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:24,300
它会在三十秒之内...
It's a cholinesterase inhibitor...

1195
01:27:24,370 --> 01:27:27,630
切断大脑至脊椎的神经信息
Stops the brain from sending nerve messages down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1196
01:27:27,700 --> 01:27:31,080
如果你暴露在它之下  你就会懂了
Any epidermal exposure or inhalation, and you'll know.

1197
01:27:31,090 --> 01:27:35,400
毒药侵袭神经系统  导致后背部剧痛
A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes your nervous system.

1198
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:37,340
别动它!
Do not move that!

1199
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:43,010
你的肌肉收缩  呼吸困难
Your muscles freeze, you can't breathe.

1200
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:46,350
强烈的痉挛能让你的五腑内脏翻出来
You spasm so hard you break your own back, spit your guts out.

1201
01:27:46,420 --> 01:27:49,220
不过皮肤会先融化
But that's after your skin melts off.

1202
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:51,690
我的天啊
My God.

1203
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:55,090
我想老天是站在我们这边的  对吧?
Oh, I think we'd like God on our side at the moment, don't you?

1204
01:27:57,100 --> 01:28:00,500
我现在要把导航晶片拆掉...
So what I'm doing now is removing the guidance system chips...

1205
01:28:00,570 --> 01:28:02,560
导弹在五百尺后会落海
so the rocket will splash down after 500 feet.

1206
01:28:02,640 --> 01:28:04,760
给我
All right, let me have that.

1207
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:05,610
你可以放手
You can let go of it.

1208
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:08,710
退后  退后!
All right, just back away. Just back away!

1209
01:28:08,720 --> 01:28:12,170
长官  停尸间小队没有回音
Sir, morgue team has not checked in.

1210
01:28:14,980 --> 01:28:16,950
黑鸟一号  这是黑鸟  请回答
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. Over.

1211
01:28:18,850 --> 01:28:21,850
黑鸟一号  这是黑鸟  请回答  该死的!
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. Come in, goddamn it!

1212
01:28:24,090 --> 01:28:27,120
还有敌人  快去!
Somebody's still there. Let's move!

1213
01:28:27,130 --> 01:28:30,030
还有鼠辈!  封锁停尸间  封锁停尸间
Rats alive! Close on the morgue. Close on the morgue.

1214
01:28:30,100 --> 01:28:32,490
快  快  快
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1215
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:35,430
动作快点  我们还有敌人!
Frye, Darrow, hustle up. We got more company!

1216
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,940
到停尸间会合  快去
Converge on the morgue. Move out.

1217
01:28:45,050 --> 01:28:47,370
古斯比  快点过来
Goodspeed, come on. Come over here.

1218
01:28:47,380 --> 01:28:50,980
我最爱压力了  那是我每天的家常便饭
Good. I love pressure. I eat it for breakfast.

1219
01:28:51,050 --> 01:28:52,780
快点  来不及了
Come on. Time's up.

1220
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:54,980
还有三枚导弹在别的地方  我们一定要找到它们
There's three rockets somewhere else. We have to find them.

1221
01:28:57,930 --> 01:29:00,160
快点!
Come on!

1222
01:29:22,920 --> 01:29:24,820
我玩这个太老了
I'm too old for this.

1223
01:29:24,890 --> 01:29:25,860
现在去哪儿?
Where's it go?

1224
01:29:25,890 --> 01:29:28,620
我不晓得
I've no idea.

1225
01:29:28,690 --> 01:29:32,060
长官  所有的导航晶片都不见了
Sir, all the guidance chips are gone.

1226
01:29:32,130 --> 01:29:34,290
你没除掉鼠辈
Captain, I guess you didn't quite take care of the rat problem.

1227
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:34,950
是的  长官
No, sir.

1228
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:36,390
这里死了两个人...
Well, there are two dead men here...

1229
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,000
我建议你最好把他们解决掉
who strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1230
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,560
是  长官
Yes, sir.

1231
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:43,130
是  长官!  瑞欧  罗斯  来吧!
Yes, sir! Rio, Royce, let's go!

1232
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:45,230
快!
Move out!

1233
01:29:50,180 --> 01:29:51,150
你不知道通往哪儿?
You really don't know where this goes?

1234
01:29:51,210 --> 01:29:52,580
没错  我不知道
No, I don't know where it goes.

1235
01:29:52,590 --> 01:29:55,810
我们越来越快了  你知道怎么让它慢下来吗?
Well, it's starting to pick up speed. Do you know how to slow it down?

1236
01:29:55,880 --> 01:29:57,910
不  我不知道
No, I don't.

1237
01:30:26,050 --> 01:30:28,240
上帝啊
God.

1238
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:38,620
梅森  你还好吧?
Mason, you all right?

1239
01:30:38,630 --> 01:30:41,920
好得很  你这个大白痴!
Yes, perfectly okay, you fucking idiot!

1240
01:30:44,370 --> 01:30:45,500
他们追来了
They're coming.

1241
01:30:45,530 --> 01:30:46,860
谁?
Who?

1242
01:30:46,940 --> 01:30:48,710
海军陆战队!
The marines!

1243
01:30:48,740 --> 01:30:49,840
哪里?
Where?

1244
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:52,560
怎么回事?
What the fuck's goin' on?

1245
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,170
把他拦住
Let's cut him off.

1246
01:32:18,090 --> 01:32:20,720
梅森!
Mason!

1247
01:32:23,770 --> 01:32:25,700
梅森!
Mason!

1248
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:46,450
你这混蛋!  去死吧!
You motherfucker! Die! Die! Die!

1249
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,330
我很高兴你没有考虑太久
I'm rather glad you didn't hesitate too long.

1250
01:34:13,940 --> 01:34:17,310
你怎么能保持冷静?
How do you do it?

1251
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:23,080
我受过世界顶尖的英国情报局严格训练
Oh, I was trained by the best. British Intelligence.

1252
01:34:25,290 --> 01:34:27,150
来吧
Come on.

1253
01:34:27,220 --> 01:34:31,590
老实说我情愿当诗人或农夫
But in retrospect, I'd rather have been a poet or a farmer.

1254
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:36,460
距离时限八小时

1255
01:34:37,500 --> 01:34:40,400
总统三小时后到
Okay, the president arrives in three hours.

1256
01:34:40,410 --> 01:34:44,860
能拖多久就拖多久  然后进行空袭
His directive is to string Hummel along until the air strike is operational.

1257
01:34:44,870 --> 01:34:47,100
铝热剂进展如何?
What's the word from Mohave, General?

1258
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:49,110
还是一样
The same as last time, Lou.

1259
01:34:49,180 --> 01:34:51,870
他们还在赶工
They're going as fast as they can.

1260
01:34:56,680 --> 01:35:00,780
跪下来!
On your knees. On your knees!

1261
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:14,030
特遣队员  你手上有我的东西
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got something that belongs to me.

1262
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:16,590
正确的说是十二片导航晶片
Twelve guidance chips, to be precise.

1263
01:35:16,670 --> 01:35:21,330
让我提醒你们  我手上有危在旦夕的人质
Let me remind you there are lives at stake, civilian lives.

1264
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:23,430
说话
Speak up.

1265
01:35:23,510 --> 01:35:24,700
说话!
Speak up!

1266
01:35:24,780 --> 01:35:27,610
告诉他们你的名字
Tell them your name.

1267
01:35:27,650 --> 01:35:30,450
我叫赖瑞韩德逊
My name is Larry Henderson.

1268
01:35:30,520 --> 01:35:34,710
-糟糕  -我有三个孩子
-Oh, man.  -And I'm a father of three.

1269
01:35:34,720 --> 01:35:38,050
他拿枪指着我的脑袋
And, uh, they've got a gun to my head.

1270
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,570
你们有三分钟可以交出导航晶片...
You've got exactly three minutes to return the guidance chips to the exercise yard...

1271
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,300
否则韩德逊先生就没命了
or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.

1272
01:35:43,330 --> 01:35:44,760
不
Oh, no.

1273
01:35:48,640 --> 01:35:54,130
还有三枚导弹  找到并且拆除它们  好吗?
Now, three to go. You find them and defuse them, okay?

1274
01:35:55,310 --> 01:35:56,900
-好的  -很好
-All right.  -All right.

1275
01:35:56,980 --> 01:36:00,610
我去找汉默  试着帮你拖延一些时间
I'll try and delay Hummel and give you more time.

1276
01:36:00,680 --> 01:36:03,910
那韩德逊的脑袋呢?
Hey, what about Mr. Henderson's head?

1277
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:07,860
没问题?
Okay?

1278
01:36:07,890 --> 01:36:09,490
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1279
01:36:14,390 --> 01:36:17,150
好吧
Okay.

1280
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,050
将军
General.

1281
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,670
你是什么人
Who the hell are you?

1282
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:36,850
我就是剩下来的敌人
I'm all that's left of the enemy.

1283
01:36:50,530 --> 01:36:52,530
找到了
Bingo.

1284
01:37:01,610 --> 01:37:03,700
把手放下
Stand easy.

1285
01:37:07,210 --> 01:37:10,380
我还以为自己是老兵
Thought I'd been in the service a long time.

1286
01:37:10,450 --> 01:37:12,860
姓名和军阶  水手
Name and rank, sailor.

1287
01:37:12,890 --> 01:37:14,780
事实上我是陆军
Well, it's army, actually.

1288
01:37:14,820 --> 01:37:19,620
回答问题  并且尊称他为"将军"
Answer the question. And address him as "General, sir."

1289
01:37:19,630 --> 01:37:25,690
将军...约翰·梅森上尉  隶属于英国皇家特种部队
Captain John Patrick Mason, General, sir...of Her Majesty's S.A.S.

1290
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:27,700
当然  已经退伍了
Retired, of course.

1291
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:34,930
你离家稍微远了点  上尉
You're a long way from home, Captain.

1292
01:37:35,010 --> 01:37:36,900
你是怎么与此事牵扯上的?
How the hell are you involved in this?

1293
01:37:36,910 --> 01:37:39,200
我对这座监狱相当熟悉
Oh, I have a unique knowledge of this prison facility.

1294
01:37:39,250 --> 01:37:41,910
我以前曾在这里作过客
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

1295
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:59,160
小家伙
Hi, sweetie.

1296
01:38:06,410 --> 01:38:08,470
给我回来  小男孩
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1297
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,920
他们有没有告诉你我的目的?
Did they bother to tell you who I am, why I'm doing this?

1298
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:15,560
还是只是利用你而已?
Or are they just using you like they do everybody else?

1299
01:38:15,570 --> 01:38:19,220
我只知道电视上说你是个越战英雄
All I know is you were big in Vietnam. I saw the highlights on television.

1300
01:38:19,290 --> 01:38:22,660
那你根本就不知道  看到优秀军人...
Then you wouldn't have any fuckin' idea what it means to lead some of the finest men...

1301
01:38:22,670 --> 01:38:25,960
被他们的政府出卖的痛苦
on God's earth into battle, and then see their memory betrayed by their own fuckin' government.

1302
01:38:26,030 --> 01:38:29,220
我看不出屠杀一百万人...
I don't quite see how you cherish the memory of the dead...

1303
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:32,060
如何能安慰他们的英灵
by killing another million.

1304
01:38:32,130 --> 01:38:35,300
而且这不是战争
And, uh, this is not combat.

1305
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:39,670
这是疯狂行径  将军
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

1306
01:38:39,740 --> 01:38:42,470
我认为你是个大白痴
Personally, I think you're a fuckin' idiot.

1307
01:38:48,080 --> 01:38:52,800
"自由之树须以爱国者和暴君的血灌溉开花"
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants."

1308
01:38:52,820 --> 01:38:54,580
汤玛士杰佛逊说的
Thomas Jefferson.

1309
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:59,650
王尔德说过"爱国主义是邪恶的美德"
"Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1310
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,500
谢谢你证明我的观点
Thank you for making my point.

1311
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:09,330
导航晶片呢?
Where are the guidance chips?

1312
01:39:09,400 --> 01:39:11,800
导航晶片呢?
Where are the guidance chips?

1313
01:39:11,810 --> 01:39:13,350
我毁掉了
I destroyed them.

1314
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:15,870
你不该这么做的
That was a bad move, soldier.

1315
01:39:15,880 --> 01:39:18,470
那你要处决我们吗?
Does that mean you'll execute us both?

1316
01:39:47,510 --> 01:39:49,920
算你走运  汉默要抓活的
You're lucky that old man Hummel wants you alive.

1317
01:39:49,930 --> 01:39:52,200
我倒很乐意把你开膛剖肚
Cause I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy.

1318
01:39:54,330 --> 01:39:58,580
距离时限五十二分钟

1319
01:39:59,050 --> 01:40:02,920
我倒很乐意把你开膛剖肚
I'd take pleasure in guttin' you Boy

1320
01:40:04,020 --> 01:40:08,350
我倒很乐意把你开膛剖肚
"I'll take pleasure in guttin' you, boy."

1321
01:40:09,730 --> 01:40:11,590
这些人是怎么了?  梅森?
What is wrong with these people, huh, Mason?

1322
01:40:11,660 --> 01:40:15,830
这岛上到处都充满了愤怒
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh, a lot of anger floatin' around this island?

1323
01:40:15,900 --> 01:40:18,680
一大堆莽撞青少年
Kind of a pubescent volatility? Don't you think?

1324
01:40:18,690 --> 01:40:23,500
你不认为他们满怀苦恼  心中都充满了杀父情结?
A lot of angst, a lot of, " I'm 16, I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1325
01:40:23,510 --> 01:40:25,620
成熟点吧!  我们...
I mean, grow up! We're stuck on an island...

1326
01:40:25,630 --> 01:40:28,940
跟一群噬血如命的变态军人混在一起
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure-seeking psychopathic marines.

1327
01:40:29,010 --> 01:40:31,680
他们真丢脸!
Shame on them!

1328
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:37,680
我只拆除了一枚导弹  还剩两枚没拆
Anyway, I only got one chem round. There's two left.

1329
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,700
梅森?
Mason?

1330
01:40:38,720 --> 01:40:41,690
我在这儿
Yes, I'm here.

1331
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:44,320
我真怀念...
I was just thinking how wonderful it was...

1332
01:40:44,400 --> 01:40:46,800
那些不准说话的日子
when the inmates weren't allowed to talk in here.

1333
01:40:46,870 --> 01:40:49,600
不准说话?
Not allowed to talk.

1334
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:51,830
你怎么受的了?
How'd you do it?

1335
01:40:51,900 --> 01:40:56,170
我在心里满怀希望
Uh, nurtured the hope that there was hope.

1336
01:40:56,180 --> 01:41:00,340
希望有一天能重获自由
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1337
01:41:00,350 --> 01:41:03,710
也许还能见到我的女儿
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1338
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:08,690
希望很卑微  却能让人保持求生意志
Modest hopes, but, uh, they kept a man alive.

1339
01:41:08,750 --> 01:41:11,920
你为什么会被关起来?
What'd they put you away for, John?

1340
01:41:11,990 --> 01:41:15,020
说来话长
Oh, that's a long story.

1341
01:41:15,090 --> 01:41:18,030
反正我哪里也去不成
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.

1342
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:21,190
我们的人有多久没有回音了?
When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz?

1343
01:41:21,270 --> 01:41:22,960
七个小时
Seven hours.

1344
01:41:25,500 --> 01:41:27,800
铝热剂完成了
Thermite plasma is operational.

1345
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:30,020
帮我接总统
Get me the president.

1346
01:41:30,040 --> 01:41:34,790
请坐  请各位保持随时待命
Be seated. Gentlemen, consider yourselves on ground alert. If we receive launch authority...

1347
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:39,150
一旦出发  你们的任务就是彻底摧毁恶魔岛
your mission is the complete thermal destruction of Alcatraz Island.

1348
01:41:39,220 --> 01:41:42,680
每一寸地都必须完全摧毁  不能有任何漏失
The entire island is to be blanketed, not one square inch missed.

1349
01:41:42,760 --> 01:41:45,590
81名平民以及部份军人...
Eighty-one American civilians and a number of U.S. Marines...

1350
01:41:45,660 --> 01:41:48,020
将会在这次攻击中牺牲
will lose their lives in this air strike.

1351
01:41:49,860 --> 01:41:52,460
你何不交出胶片...
Why didn't you just tell them where the microfilm was...

1352
01:41:52,530 --> 01:41:55,430
问题不就解决了?
and, and create a solution?

1353
01:41:55,500 --> 01:42:00,170
一旦胶片拿到手  他们就会让我死
Hmph. The moment they had the microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1354
01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:02,210
这是他们的解决办法
Some solution.

1355
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:04,230
结果你被关在这儿
And you ended up here.

1356
01:42:04,310 --> 01:42:08,420
这让我想到另一个问题  当年你...
Which brings me to another question. When you broke out...

1357
01:42:08,430 --> 01:42:11,590
逃狱的时候我干脆直说吧...
Let me see if I can get this straight. You went down the incinerator chute...

1358
01:42:11,600 --> 01:42:14,020
你当年下到焚化炉...滑运道..坐上矿坑小车
on the mine cars, through the tunnels...

1359
01:42:14,050 --> 01:42:17,180
穿过隧道到达发电厂
to the power plant.

1360
01:42:17,190 --> 01:42:21,690
再穿过蒸气引擎...那招真的很帅...
under the steam engine... That was really cool, by the way...

1361
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:24,320
进入贮水池然后从水管逃出去
and into the cistern through the intake pipe.

1362
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,990
不过你到底是...
But how, in the name of Zeus's butthole...

1363
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,900
怎么逃出牢房的?
did you get out of your cell?

1364
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:35,700
我之所以问是因为我们目前的处境...
I only ask because in our current situation...

1365
01:42:35,770 --> 01:42:41,040
这招应该会很有用!
well, it could prove to be useful information, maybe!

1366
01:42:59,260 --> 01:43:02,360
职业秘密  孩子
Trade secrets, my son.

1367
01:43:04,970 --> 01:43:07,400
将军  我们只剩两枚可用的导弹
General, two operational rockets left.

1368
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:09,200
一枚在灯塔  一枚在屋顶
One's at the lower lighthouse and there is one on the roof.

1369
01:43:09,270 --> 01:43:12,330
都随时待命了  长官
And both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.

1370
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:13,920
将军  你听到吗?
G-General, can you hear me?

1371
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:15,710
我听到了  上尉
I heard you, Captain.

1372
01:43:15,780 --> 01:43:18,380
我只想确定一下
Oh, just makin' sure.

1373
01:43:18,450 --> 01:43:23,080
我们是否该准备发射了?  将军?
Should we prepare for launch, General?

1374
01:43:23,160 --> 01:43:25,250
我来决定战略  上尉
I'll handle the strategy, Captain.

1375
01:43:25,260 --> 01:43:28,450
我懂了
Yes, sir.

1376
01:43:28,460 --> 01:43:30,030
时间快到了
The hour is approaching, sir.

1377
01:43:30,060 --> 01:43:32,700
我只想让你知道这点  长官
Just letting the General know of the time, sir.

1378
01:43:32,710 --> 01:43:34,740
这点我很清楚  上尉
I'm very aware of the time, Captain.

1379
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:36,870
是的  长官  只是要让你知道
Aye, aye, sir. Lettin' you know.

1380
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:39,600
弟兄们都准备大干一场
Me and my boys are ready to cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1381
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:43,300
梅森  你要上哪儿去?
Mason, where're you going?

1382
01:43:43,310 --> 01:43:46,570
三十年前我就发誓绝不能死在这里
Thirty years ago I vowed I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1383
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:47,680
你不能走!
You're not leaving!

1384
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:52,080
那个狂人手里正操纵着导弹的发射按钮!
There's a madman in there with his hand on a, on a button!

1385
01:43:52,150 --> 01:43:55,380
他会被狙击手一枪打死的
Shh. Some sniper's gonna get his ass.

1386
01:43:55,920 --> 01:43:59,180
站住  梅森
Stop moving, Mason.

1387
01:43:59,190 --> 01:44:01,580
梅森  别动
Mason, stop moving.

1388
01:44:01,590 --> 01:44:05,990
汉默不会下手的  他是个军人  不是个谋杀犯
Hummel won't do it. He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1389
01:44:06,060 --> 01:44:07,400
我从他的眼神看得出来
I read it in his eyes.

1390
01:44:07,430 --> 01:44:09,630
你从他的眼神看得出来?
You read his eyes?

1391
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:11,400
那敢情好!
Oh, well, then, everything's just fine!

1392
01:44:11,410 --> 01:44:13,210
我不能冒这个险
I can't afford to take that chance.

1393
01:44:13,240 --> 01:44:14,940
拜托你再大声点
Why don't you talk louder?

1394
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:19,270
还剩三分钟  长官
Three minutes to go, sir.

1395
01:44:19,340 --> 01:44:22,410
-他们不会打电话来了  -它们会的
-They're not gonna call, Frank.  -Oh, they'll call.

1396
01:44:22,420 --> 01:44:25,670
我们发射一枚导弹他们就会打来的
They'll call if we fire one of our rockets up their ass.

1397
01:44:33,030 --> 01:44:34,150
我是汉默
Hummel.

1398
01:44:34,190 --> 01:44:36,360
法兰克  我是克拉玛
Hi, Frank. It's Al Kramer here.

1399
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:37,000
怎么样?
How's it going out there?

1400
01:44:37,030 --> 01:44:38,200
你认为呢?
How do you think it's goin'?

1401
01:44:38,210 --> 01:44:40,650
听着  我们还需要一小时
Listen, on this end we're gonna need another hour, Frank.

1402
01:44:40,700 --> 01:44:42,390
你们只剩三分钟
You've got three minutes.

1403
01:44:42,470 --> 01:44:45,440
法兰克  我们得等总统
Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get final authorization from the president.

1404
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,320
你们只有三分钟
You've got three minutes.

1405
01:44:47,330 --> 01:44:50,040
法兰克  请你别做傻事
Frank, please don't do anything stupid.

1406
01:44:52,640 --> 01:44:54,610
他们还需要一个小时
They want another hour.

1407
01:44:54,680 --> 01:44:58,050
鬼扯  他们在骗人!  将军
Well, that's bullshit. That's bullshit, General. They're lyin'!

1408
01:44:58,120 --> 01:45:00,210
他们在耍你
They're calling our bluff, sir.

1409
01:45:00,290 --> 01:45:03,380
把你当白痴  长官
They're playing you for a fool, sir.

1410
01:45:03,390 --> 01:45:07,490
下令发射导弹  将军
Order the launch, General.

1411
01:45:07,560 --> 01:45:09,400
快点  将军
Come on, General.

1412
01:45:09,430 --> 01:45:11,150
我们下定决心吧!
Let's be all we can be.

1413
01:45:25,510 --> 01:45:27,640
任务还没完成!
The mission's not complete!

1414
01:45:27,710 --> 01:45:29,650
我的任务完成了
Well, mine is.

1415
01:45:29,720 --> 01:45:32,550
这个任务结束之后你会回家...
When this is over, you'll go back home...

1416
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:37,650
开着你的棕色富豪轿车  把卡拉和小宝宝逼疯
driving Carla and your baby insane in your beige Volvo.

1417
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:41,390
我不是死了就是回到监狱  那都没什么两样
And I'll be dead or back in prison, which is the same thing.

1418
01:45:41,460 --> 01:45:43,590
你不能走
You're not leaving.

1419
01:45:48,000 --> 01:45:52,100
好吧  我自己来
All right, I'll do it myself.

1420
01:45:52,940 --> 01:45:55,700
我受过三星期武器训练
I got three weeks' weapons training.

1421
01:45:55,770 --> 01:45:59,710
我能消灭...整排海陆
I'll kick the... Out of a platoon full of marines.

1422
01:45:59,780 --> 01:46:02,610
小意思
No problem.

1423
01:46:13,730 --> 01:46:17,330
-少校  将我连接上屋顶的导弹  -是  长官
-Major, patch me into Roof Battery.  -Aye, sir.

1424
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:20,890
打开控制电路  准备接收目标方位
Fire open control circuit coordinates to the roof, sir.

1425
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,360
快点!
Let's go!

1426
01:46:28,670 --> 01:46:30,430
启动电源
Laser powered up!

1427
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:33,460
不好
Oh, no.

1428
01:46:33,480 --> 01:46:35,840
我说  给我跪下!
I said, on your knees!

1429
01:46:35,850 --> 01:46:37,550
我的名字叫史丹利古斯比
My name's Stanley Goodspeed.

1430
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:41,050
我是FBI的化学武器专家
I'm a chemical weapons specialist for the FBI.

1431
01:46:41,120 --> 01:46:42,120
玻璃瓮还是塑胶袋?
Uh, glass or plastic?

1432
01:46:42,150 --> 01:46:43,110
什么?
What?

1433
01:46:43,190 --> 01:46:44,560
玻璃瓮还是塑胶袋?
Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic?

1434
01:46:44,590 --> 01:46:45,820
闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up!

1435
01:46:45,890 --> 01:46:48,620
因为如果导弹发射后风向改变的话...
Because if the winds change after you launch those rockets...

1436
01:46:48,690 --> 01:46:50,840
-我们都会死  -闭嘴!
-we're all gonna die.  -Shut up!

1437
01:46:50,850 --> 01:46:54,860
你的尸体不是用玻璃瓮就是用塑胶袋装
And you're gonna end up in either a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1438
01:46:54,930 --> 01:46:57,800
你自己想想看  把枪交给我...
So, what do you say you do the math, h-hand over the gun...

1439
01:46:57,810 --> 01:46:59,380
我们去找导弹吧?
and let's go find some rockets?

1440
01:46:59,400 --> 01:47:01,810
我叫你闭嘴...
I said shut the fuck...

1441
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,330
你的选择是对的
You made the right choice.

1442
01:47:11,340 --> 01:47:13,360
我决定不让你的孩子...
I decided I didn't want your child...

1443
01:47:13,390 --> 01:47:14,550
没有父亲伴他成长
growing up without a father.

1444
01:47:16,290 --> 01:47:19,740
我上回游到对岸的时候年龄跟你差不多
Hey, the last time I swam this channel I was your age.

1445
01:47:19,750 --> 01:47:22,160
我现在怎么做都是一样  来吧
So, I'm fucked either way. So, come on.

1446
01:47:22,170 --> 01:47:25,300
导弹已经就绪  我在等待发射指令
Weapon is hot. I am standing by for the launch command.

1447
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:27,690
杀死特遣队是一回事...
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing...

1448
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,200
但我们真的要这样做吗?
Is this for real?

1449
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:31,660
只是公事公办

1453
01:47:45,020 --> 01:47:49,750
导弹已经就绪  我在等待发射指令
The weapon is hot. I'm standing by for launch command.

1454
01:47:49,820 --> 01:47:51,850

1455
01:47:58,530 --> 01:48:01,020
等待指令
Standing by for command.

1456
01:48:08,970 --> 01:48:11,570
我在等发射命令
I'm waiting for launch command, General.

1457
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:22,580
-发射  -发射!
-Fire.  -Fire!

1458
01:48:27,020 --> 01:48:29,860
导弹升空!  导弹升空!
Missile loose! Missile loose!

1459
01:48:35,370 --> 01:48:39,960
恶魔岛  座标67253725
Origin: Alcatraz, 67253725.

-What's the goddamn heading?  -Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1461
01:48:44,180 --> 01:48:44,770

Speed?

1462
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:46,540
300海里  飞向奥克兰市
Three hundred knots. It's headed right at Oakland.

1463
01:48:47,850 --> 01:48:51,010
美式足球赛
Football game.

1464
01:48:53,350 --> 01:48:55,180
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

1465
01:49:18,110 --> 01:49:20,400
导弹完全改变方向
Missile radically changing direction.

1466
01:49:20,410 --> 01:49:20,740
目标放弃

1467
01:49:26,280 --> 01:49:29,260
新方向  西方275度
New direction: 275 degrees west.

1468
01:49:29,290 --> 01:49:30,720
那是飞向海中  长官
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1469
01:49:32,120 --> 01:49:34,450
天啊!
Oh, Christ!

1470
01:49:34,530 --> 01:49:36,930
导弹正在下降
Missile losing altitude. Falling.

1471
01:49:36,940 --> 01:49:41,970
继续下降300尺...200...100
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1472
01:49:45,170 --> 01:49:48,070
导弹在水里引爆了
Bogey detonated under water.

1473
01:49:51,280 --> 01:49:52,500
搞什么?
What the fuck?

1474
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:55,010
没射中
It missed.

1475
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,240
-太好了  -当然
-Well, that's great.  -Extremely great.

1476
01:49:57,250 --> 01:49:59,610
可是还有一枚
But there's still one left.

1477
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:03,380
导弹是怎么回事?  座标怎么会变?
What happened to the rocket? What the fuck happened to the coordinates?

1478
01:50:03,450 --> 01:50:07,020
到底是怎么回事?  长官!  少校!
What the fuck is going on? Sir! Major!

1479
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:10,400
-上尉  请你出去  -告诉我  长官
-Captain, step outside.  -Talk to me, sir.

1480
01:50:10,410 --> 01:50:12,150
上尉  请你出去!
Captain, step outside!

1481
01:50:25,610 --> 01:50:27,870
帮我接五角大厦
Get me the Pentagon.

1482
01:50:41,360 --> 01:50:44,860
那算什么?  法兰克?
What the hell was that, Frank?

1483
01:50:44,930 --> 01:50:47,500
-我说  那算...-我听到你说的了!
-I said, what the hell...  -I heard what you said!

1484
01:50:47,550 --> 01:50:51,730
就算你想犯上  也请你放尊重点
If you're gonna be insubordinate. I'd appreciate it if you'd do it with a little more respect.

1485
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:52,280
废话少说  将军
Cut the crap, General.

1486
01:50:52,290 --> 01:50:53,740
-你在干什么?  -我还不想伤害无辜百姓
-What the hell are you doing?  -I'm not ready to kill these people.

1487
01:50:53,800 --> 01:50:54,660
打电话给五角大厦  再向他们争取时间
Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.

1488
01:50:54,670 --> 01:50:55,860
不
No!

1489
01:50:55,940 --> 01:50:59,030
快点  法兰克!  我们就快失控了
Do it, Frank! We're coming loose.

1490
01:50:59,110 --> 01:51:02,240
你才失控了  其他人还是很冷静的
You're coming loose. The rest of us are in complete control.

1491
01:51:02,310 --> 01:51:04,610
我们要新的时限
We're askin' 'em. We're askin' 'em for a new deadline.

1492
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:05,280
放下电话
Put the phone down.

1493
01:51:05,350 --> 01:51:07,250
-兄弟们开始失控了  -他们是陆战队员!
-The men are falling apart.  -The men are marines!

1494
01:51:07,320 --> 01:51:10,950
是吗?
Are they?

1495
01:51:11,020 --> 01:51:13,560
-我找克拉玛将军  -我以老朋友的身份劝你
-I wanna talk to General Kramer.  -You've been asked by an old friend.

1496
01:51:13,570 --> 01:51:16,320
-现在就打电话给他  -我以上司的身份命令你
-Put him on the phone right now.  -You've been ordered by a superior officer.

1497
01:51:16,330 --> 01:51:17,010
我是巴斯特少校
This is Major Baxter.

1498
01:51:17,020 --> 01:51:18,500
我给你最后一次机会
Now you're being given your last chance by a man with a gun.

1499
01:51:18,550 --> 01:51:19,890
把电话放下
Put the phone down.

1500
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:26,610
我以为你还没准备杀人
I thought you weren't ready to kill.

1501
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:28,660
我开始准备了
I'm warmin' up.

1502
01:51:29,970 --> 01:51:31,910
稍息
At ease.

1503
01:51:40,420 --> 01:51:43,050
你得做出决定  总统先生
They need a decision, Mr. President.

1504
01:51:52,100 --> 01:51:54,660
过去这几个小时...
These past few hours...

1505
01:51:54,730 --> 01:51:58,570
是我生命中最漫长  最黑暗的时刻
have been the longest, darkest of my life.

1506
01:51:58,640 --> 01:52:02,360
人命该如何衡量呢?
How does one weigh human life?

1507
01:52:02,370 --> 01:52:06,400
一百万市民和81名人质
One million civilians against 81 hostages.

1508
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:10,110
还有法兰克·汉默
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1509
01:52:11,020 --> 01:52:18,620
我们忽视并遗弃像汉默这样伟大的英雄
That we have ignored, abandoned or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel...

1510
01:52:18,690 --> 01:52:23,630
还有那些被忽视且为国捐驱的军人子弟...
and that American boys have paid for that neglect in blood...

1511
01:52:23,640 --> 01:52:27,930
同样地真实  也同样地悲哀
is equally real and equally tragic.

1512
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:33,330
我们向恐怖行动宣战
We are at war with terror.

1513
01:52:33,340 --> 01:52:35,870
战争必有伤亡
Fighting a war means casualties.

1514
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:39,800
这是我所做过最困难的决定
This is the worst call I've ever had to make.

1515
01:52:43,380 --> 01:52:46,540
批准空袭行动
Air strike approved.

1516
01:52:49,690 --> 01:52:51,680
红雷  准备起飞
Red Thunder to tower. Request clearance.

1517
01:52:52,660 --> 01:52:54,820
投下这么多的弹药...
With the amount of firepower they're gonna drop in there...

1518
01:52:54,830 --> 01:52:56,450
塔台  准备起飞
Tower this is Strike Leader. Prepared to go.

1519
01:52:56,490 --> 01:52:58,860
几秒就会完全毁灭
It'll be over in a few seconds.

1520
01:52:58,930 --> 01:53:01,330
十七分钟后抵达目标
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1521
01:53:07,800 --> 01:53:10,850
对不起  将军  恕我无理
Excuse me, General, sir, with all due respect to you.

1522
01:53:10,910 --> 01:53:12,610
你倒底在搞什么鬼?
But what the fuck is going on?

1523
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:14,150
你更改了座标  是不是  将军?
You changed the coordinates, didn't you, General?

1524
01:53:14,210 --> 01:53:15,630
没错  上尉
That's affirmative, Captain.

1525
01:53:15,640 --> 01:53:19,800
现在他们以为我们没种  因为我们什么都没做到
So, now they think we're gutless, the Feds? They think we won't actually do it.

1526
01:53:19,810 --> 01:53:22,400
他们会从海上与空中全力进攻
They're gonna come at us with everything they've got. Air and sea.

1527
01:53:22,410 --> 01:53:24,320
把我们炸的粉身碎骨
They're gonna bomb our ass back to the Stone Age.

1528
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:27,250
他们不知道我们是故意错开目标的
They don't know we missed on purpose.

1529
01:53:27,260 --> 01:53:31,620
太好了  我们不是没种  而是无能
Great. We're not gutless, we're incompetent.

1530
01:53:31,660 --> 01:53:33,060
对吧?
That right?

1531
01:53:33,130 --> 01:53:36,580
我不喜欢你的口气  上尉
I don't think I like your tone, Captain. We planned for this contingency.

1532
01:53:36,590 --> 01:53:39,680
带导弹和四名人质撤退
Load the V.X. Into the choppers, take four hostages and evacuate.

1533
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:41,670
我会留下来承担一切后果
The consequences of our actions I'll face alone.

1534
01:53:41,740 --> 01:53:45,270
对不起  将军  他妈的钱呢?
Excuse me, General, but what about the fucking money?

1535
01:53:45,340 --> 01:53:47,830
没有钱  任务结束
There is no fucking money. Mission's over.

1536
01:53:47,910 --> 01:53:49,110
放屁
Bullshit it's over.

1537
01:53:49,120 --> 01:53:53,410
你在跟一位将军讲话  维持军纪
You're talking to a General, soldier. Maintain discipline.

1538
01:53:53,420 --> 01:53:54,810
我不是军人  少校
I'm not a soldier, Major.

1539
01:53:54,820 --> 01:53:57,520
在我们挟持人质之后  我们就成了佣兵
The day we took hostages we became mercenaries.

1540
01:53:57,550 --> 01:54:00,320
佣兵要的是钱!
And mercenaries get paid!

1541
01:54:00,390 --> 01:54:03,020
我要我的钱!
I want my fucking money!

1542
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:05,840
这项任务全靠武力威胁
This mission was based on the threat of force.

1543
01:54:05,850 --> 01:54:10,990
我不会屠杀八万无辜百姓  你以为我疯了吗?
I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people. Do you think I'm out of my fucking mind?

1544
01:54:12,870 --> 01:54:14,210
我们虚张声势  他们发现了
We bluffed. They called it.

1545
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,060
任务结束
The mission's over.

1546
01:54:19,880 --> 01:54:23,100
谁说我们是虚张声势的  将军?
Whoever said anything about bluffing, General?

1547
01:54:23,110 --> 01:54:25,110
退下  上尉
Stand down, Captain.

1548
01:54:29,020 --> 01:54:32,020
退下  上尉!
Stand down, Captain!

1549
01:54:37,990 --> 01:54:40,900
少校  我要你带着这些人上直升机  准备撤退
Major, I'm ordering you to take these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1550
01:54:43,200 --> 01:54:45,480
我的命令很简单  少校!
That's a simple order, Major!

1551
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:48,000
一点都不简单  法兰克
It's not so simple, Frank.

1552
01:54:48,070 --> 01:54:50,540
柯中士...
Sergeant Crisp...

1553
01:54:50,610 --> 01:54:52,900
逮捕将军
secure the General.

1554
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:55,880
我解除你的指挥权  长官
I'm relieving you of your command, sir.

1555
01:54:59,520 --> 01:55:02,440
中士!
Sergeant!

1556
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:12,790
-请把手枪给我  长官  -你是说这把吗?
-I'll have that sidearm, sir.  -You mean this sidearm?

1557
01:55:20,970 --> 01:55:24,460
少校  你站在哪一边?
Major Baxter, you're either with us or against us.

1558
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:33,210
我很荣幸能跟你一起服役  将军
It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve with you, General.

1559
01:55:37,490 --> 01:55:41,050
可是就像他说的...
But like he said...

1560
01:55:41,560 --> 01:55:45,020
一切都结束了
it's over.

1561
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:03,100
我们去救他
Let's get him.

1562
01:56:07,420 --> 01:56:10,850
梅森!
Mason!

1563
01:56:12,890 --> 01:56:14,150
我的天啊  我做了什么?
My God, what have I done?

1564
01:56:14,190 --> 01:56:15,280
还有一枚导弹呢?
Where's the last rocket?

1565
01:56:15,760 --> 01:56:17,450
最后一枚导弹呢?
Where's the last rocket?

1566
01:56:20,460 --> 01:56:21,600
最后一枚导弹呢?
Where's the last rocket?

1567
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:22,690
灯塔
Lower lighthouse.

1568
01:56:22,700 --> 01:56:26,230
-灯塔  -快去!
-Lower lighthouse.  Go!

1569
01:56:38,480 --> 01:56:42,350
快去灯塔  我来解决这个混蛋!
Darrow, go to the lighthouse. I'll take care of this fucker!

1570
01:56:48,620 --> 01:56:52,890
一  二  三  吃颗这个吧!
One, two, three! Eat that!

1571
01:57:06,540 --> 01:57:08,730
搞定了
Did it.

1572
01:57:39,780 --> 01:57:40,750
别乱来
Come here.

1573
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:43,490
过来  过来  你这孬种
Come here, you little chicken shit!

1574
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:47,650
你开枪打我  我就丢下这个  我们两个都死定了
You shoot me, I drop this. We're both dead.

1575
01:57:47,720 --> 01:57:49,980
别害怕  我不会伤害你的
Well, come on. Come on. Don't be scared. I won't hurt ya.

1576
01:57:50,050 --> 01:57:52,680
-来吧  -你知道这玩意的厉害吗?
-Come on.  -Do you know how this shit works?

1577
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:54,520
你知道这玩意的厉害吗?
You know how this shit works?

1578
01:57:57,560 --> 01:57:59,790
来吧
Come on. Come on.

1579
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,790
我不用枪  我放下来
I don't need the gun. I'll put it down.
