50
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:33,240
卡萝不准 卡萝认为花六百块来买张唱片是很蠢的事
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

51
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,150
没错 何不花十三块买张CD呢?
Carla's right. Why don't you just spend $13 on a CD, man?

52
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,750
其一是因为我是披头士迷
First of all, it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

可能是洗洁精 也可能是沙林毒气
It could be detergent, or it could be sarin gas.

59
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,570
波斯尼亚难民营?
Bosnian refugee camp?

60
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,970

The bad news is that the gas is corrosive and it's eating our suits.

80
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,710

- It's all over my hand, man! - The really bad news...

81
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,520

is there's enough C-4 explosive and poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

82
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,520

快让我出来
Get me the fuck out of this gas chamber!

116
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:16,270
我差点把针筒插到心脏里
I almost stabbed myself in the heart with this thing.

117
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,940
- 史丹利? - 亲爱的
- Stan? - Hey, darling .

118
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,710

00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,190
我过了很有趣的一天
I had such an interesting day today.

120
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:34,080
我也是一样
Yeah, I had kind of an interesting day myself.

121
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,230
好吧 你先说吧
Oh, okay, you go first.

122
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,330
恐怖份子寄出一个小包裹 盒子装的
Oh, just some terrorists decided to send a little care package, box of goodies...

123
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:45,970
必须在它炸毁整栋大楼前拆除干净…
which had to be neutralized before blowing up the office.

124
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,400
所以我下午请假 回家喝点小酒 弹弹吉他
So I took the rest of the day off. Glass of wine, little guitar...

125
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,500
- 好好休息 - 哇哦

126
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:56,440
甜心 这是个疯狂又危险的世界
The world is being Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

127
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,950
任何人在这时候生儿育女
I really believe that anyone who's even thinking about having a child in this world...

128
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:03,140
是件残酷的事
is coldly considering an act of cruelty.

129
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,790
我在胡言乱语 对不起 你有什么事?
I know, I'm rambling,I'm complaining.I'm sorry.What's your news, baby?

130
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:11,450

- I'm pregnant. - I'm sorry?

131
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:14,030
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

132
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:20,000
- 真的? - 真的
- Really? - Yeah.

133
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:23,730
- 哇… - 你只会说"哇"吗?
- Wow! - Is that all you're gonna say, is "wow"?

134
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,310
- 你怀孕了? - 三个礼拜
- You're pregnant? - Three weeks.

135
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,640
你怎么知道? 我是说 你怎么知道的?
How do you know? I mean, h-how do you know?

136
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:32,340
验孕剂显示出蓝色
Blue!

137
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,380
我就去看医生了
Just turned blue so I went to the doctor.

138
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:38,490
- 你不是认真的吧? - 什么?
- Well, you didn't mean what you just said, did you? - When?

139
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:41,090
你刚说生儿育女是一件残酷的事
Uh, just right now when you were talking about bringing a child into the world...

140
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:44,990
那是当时的念头
and having it be an act of cruelty. I meant it at the time.

141
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,790
史丹利 那是七秒前的事
Stanley, at the time? You said it seven and a half seconds ago.

142
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,700
天啊 中间还发生很多事 我们甚至还没结婚呢
Well, gosh! Kind of a lot's happened since then.Look, we're not even married.

143
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,840
真好笑 你正好提到重点
I know. It's funny you should mention that.

144
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,770
好笑? 你爱我吗?
It's funny? Do you love me?

145
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,240
我当然爱你 很好
Of course I love you. Good.

146
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:11,420
- 你肯娶我吗? - 慢点 别操之过急
- Will you marry me? - Whoa! Whoa! Wai... Hey, Marriage Police, pull over!

147
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:14,850
别闹了 史丹利 我正在向你求婚呢
Come on, Stanley. I'm proposing to you right now.

148
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,340
恶魔岛是史上最有名 也最恐怖的监狱
The Rock is the most famous and was the most feared prison ever built.

149
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,340
真的从来没有人能逃狱?
Is it really true that there's never been an escape?

150
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,660
没错 一九三六年到一九六三年监狱关闭前
Ah, that's true. From 1936 until '63 when the prison closed...

151
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,410
总共有十四次逃狱事件
there were 14 attempts.

152
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:41,520
没有人能够活着逃上岸
No one is believed to have made it to shore, alive at least.

153
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:46,680
这里不准游客进入
No, uh, h-h-hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry, but tourists are not allowed back here.

154
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,850
谁甩你 你管的着吗?
I don't really give a shit! Do you give a shit?

155
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,430
- 你们过来 - 快点!
- No.Come here, fruity. - Move!

156
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:55,500
- 小妹妹 玩的开心吗? - 开心
- Hey, girls? Hi. You all having a good time? - Yeah.

157
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,600
帮我做件事好吗? 这事很重要
Will you do something for me? It's really, it's really important.

158
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,970
我要你们去跟老师讲 马上请老师带你们回船上
I need you to tell your teacher that you need to get back on the boat and go home right now.

159
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,540
各位 欢迎到百老汇
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Broadway!

160
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,010

This cell block housed... This cell block housed... This cell block housed...

161
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:11,550
美国最凶狠的匪徒

164
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,160
大家排好!
On the line!

165
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:28,760
挺狭窄的吧?
Pretty tight quarters, aren't they, huh?

166
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,230
就像笼中兽一般
Like being a caged animal.

167
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,160
- 被关在里面几年… - 怎么了?
Spend a couple of years in there - What's the matter, fellas?

- Something wrong with the tour? - The tour's over, Bob.

169
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,740
这算什么鬼游览啊?
What kind of fucked-up tour is this?

170
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:03,570
汉默将军 费上尉和戴上尉报到

我不准佩枪
I'm not allowed to carry a gun.

174
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:14,900
你没有枪 我有一把
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun? I got a goddamned gun.

175
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:18,610

180
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,040
快点吧
Let's move it.

181
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:52,640
系统启动
Systems up.

182
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:57,220
澡堂有个可能的渗透点 我们设置警告系统
Possible penetration point in the shower room. We're setting anti-intrusion.

183
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:01,320
我带来很特别的东西 长官 一个震动侦测器
I brought a personal touch, sir. It's an anti-motion trembler device.

184
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:05,860
特别订制的 没有人知道它的存在 更无法防范它
It's custom-made. Nobody knows about it

185
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:09,260
- 它有什么作用? - 先用激光诱导敌人
- What's it do? - We head-fake 'em with the laser beam.

186
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,370
只要触动这个震动侦测器 他们就完了
And then if they disturb Mr. Backup here, we own 'em.

187
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:30,580
各位被强制监禁在此
Ladies and gentlemen, you're being detained against your will.

188
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,220
我感到很抱歉 我们无意伤害你们
For that, I apologize.It is not our intention in any way to harm you.

189
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:39,690

You will not be detained one minute longer than is necessary for us to complete our mission.

190
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,600
立正
Attention on deck!

191
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,000
各位请稍息
Stand easy, men.

192
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:56,310
别怀疑 我们正身处险境
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen, we are now in harm's way.

193
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,440
我和巴少校在六八年越战
For Major Baxter and l,this is the last campaign in a career dating back...

194
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:01,640
就是同胞了
to Tet '68.

195
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,980
同样的 韩上尉和柯中士
Likewise for Captain Hendrix, Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

196
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:08,820
跟随我在波斯湾战争中开始了他们的军旅生涯
who cut their teeth under my command in Desert Storm.

197
00:18:08,990 --> 00:18:10,280
而费上尉和戴上尉
Captain Frye, Captain Darrow,this is my first operational situation with you,

198
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:15,390
这则是我首次与你们共事 你们的表现的确名不虚传
And I have to say, thus far your conduct reflects your reputations.

199
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,460
- 谢谢你 将军 - 谢谢你 长官
- Thank you, General. - Thank you, sir.

200
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:20,870
我们占领此地的的行动 沉着准确又大胆
We have achieved our position through poise, precision and audacity.

201
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,200
为此 我们更要充满决心
To this we must now add resolve.

202
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,740
我们会被视为叛国者
We'll be branded as traitors, the gravest capital crime.

203
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,340
最严重的罪犯最重可被判死刑
Punishable by death.

204
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,850
数百年前
Couple hundred years ago,a few guys named Washington,Jefferson and Adams...

205
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:38,210
华盛顿杰佛逊等建国者也被英国视为叛国者
were branded as traitors by the British.

206
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,260
现在他们则被视为爱国者
And now they're called patriots.

207
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,320
历史将还我们清白
In time, so shall we.

208
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,260
如情况许可 凭着人质和VX毒气弹头
in less than 48 hours,we will evacuate this island in gunships...

209
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:52,800
我们将在48小时内撤离
under cover of hostages and V.X. gas warheads.

210
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:56,410
你们的目的地是没有引渡条约国家
Your destination: a non-extradition treaty country.

211
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,740
你们每人将获得一百万美元的酬金
You will each be paid a fee of $1 million for services rendered.

212
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:05,370
但你们永远不能再踏上你们故乡的土地
But you can never again set foot on your native soil.

213
00:19:05,550 --> 00:19:08,920
- 你们可以接受吗? - 可以 长官
- Can you live with that? - Yes, sir!

214
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,780
海军陆战队侦搜大队
The men of Marine Force Recon are selected...

215
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,980
被派往世界各地执行非法任务
to carry out illegal operations throughout the world.

216
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,790
当他们战死异乡
When they don't come home...

217
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,860
家人所得到的只有谎言
their families are told fairy tales about what happened to them...

218
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:25,130
没有任何补偿
and denied compensation.

219
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,700
这些谎言我已忍受一辈子
Well, I have choked on these lies my entire career!

220
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,270
现在该在此停止这些谎言了
Well, here and now the lies stop!

221
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,810
上帝保佑你们 各就各位
God be with all of you. Man your positions, men.

222
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:44,290
华盛顿 七点四十分

223
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,150
我是联邦调查局局长沃麦
This is FBI Director Womack.

224
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,690
局长 请听清楚
Director, be advised.

225
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:53,620
有81名 我重复
Eighty-one, I say again,

226
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,600
目前有81名人质在我手上
81 civilians are under my control as of this moment.

227
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,930
请将此列为最高机密
You are to take measures to assure this remains a need-to-know classified fact.

228
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:06,240
- 你是谁? - 局长先生 你面临一个很严重的问题
- Who is this? - Mr. Director, you have a very serious problem.

229
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,470
VX毒气导弹如箭在弦
A battery of V.X. gas rockets is presently deployed to deliver...

230
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:14,240
准备对旧金山湾区发出致命的一击
a highly lethal strike on the population of the San Francisco Bay area.

231
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,250
午夜时我将再以电话通知 提出我的要求
I will call again at 0100 hours to state my demands.

232
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,680
- 你是什么人? - 海军陆战队法兰斯・汉默准将
- I want to know who I'm talking to. - This is Brigadier General

233
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:23,420
从恶魔岛发话 完毕
Francis X. Hummel, United States Marine Corps, from Alcatraz.

234
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,990
我马上取消你的约会
I'll cancel your reservations.

235
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,450
联络五角大厦
Get the Pentagon. and call the San Francisco office.

236
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:33,670
通知旧金山办公室 看来恶魔岛又重新开张了
It seems Alcatraz was just reopened.

237
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:37,960
五角大楼 11点58分 昨晚汉默将军带领一群彪悍但无害的陆战队员
Last night General Hummel, using brutal but nonlethal force...

238
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,810
在安全士官的眼前
under the guise of a security exercise,

239
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:43,040
偷走十五枚VX毒气导弹
walked off with 15 V.X. poison gas rockets.

240
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:45,110
过程中他的一名手下丧生
He lost one of his own men in the process.

241
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,940
汉默将军在越南的时候 他那时还是上校
That's General Hummel in Vietnam. I think he was a major at the time.

242
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,250
他在越南参与过三次任务 参与过巴拿马格瑞那达和波斯湾战争
Three tours in Vietnam, Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm.

243
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:58,550
荣获三面紫星勋章 两面银星勋章 国会荣誉勋章…天啊
Three Purple Hearts,two Silver Stars and the Congressional Medal of...

244
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,660
这个人是个英雄
Jesus! This man is a hero!

245
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,960
我想"传奇英雄"应该是比较恰当的形容词
Well, I think "legend" might be a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

246
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:07,800
我们可在他的英雄事迹上加上绑架和勒索了
Well, now we can add kidnapping and extortion to his list of accolades.

247
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,000
辛克莱先生 汉默将军是条好汉
Mr. Sinclair, General Hummel is a man of honor.

248
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,340
将军 是他
General, it's him.

249
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:19,010
法兰克 我是艾尔克・拉玛 嗨…艾尔 你好吗?
Frank, it's AI Kramer. Hi, Al, how you doing ?

250
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,780
我不晓得 法兰克 你说呢?
I don't know, Frank. Ah, why don't you tell me.

251
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,680
我这里有一堆忧虑的家伙 法兰克
Got a lot of very, very worried people here, Frank.

252
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,380
我就直说吧
I'll come straight to the point.

253
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,280
在我的指挥之下有83名陆战队员为国捐驱
Eight-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands.

254
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,690
在寮国北部与中国南部牺牲了47名
Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China.

255
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:35,990
我们从未承认曾派兵到中国南部去
Southern China? We never admitted we sent troops into China.

256
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,330
这是谁? 表明身份
Who is this? ldentify yourself.

257
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:41,330
白宫幕僚长海顿・辛克莱
White House Chief of Staff Hayden Sinclair, General.

258
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,870
你今年几岁? 海顿・辛克莱幕僚长
How old are you, Chief of Staff Sinclair?

259
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,480
- 我33岁 - 那么 辛克莱先生
- I'm 33. - Well, Mr. Sinclair,

260
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,650
你也许根本就不明白我在说什么
you've probably got no fucking idea what I'm talking about.

261
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:53,150
你九岁时 我就在中国从事秘密活动
By your ninth birthday, I was running black ops into China...

262
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:56,010
歼灭了两百名敌军
and my men were responsible f-for over 200 enemy kills.

263
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,050
拿些胶带去帖住辛克莱先生的嘴
Al, put some rigging tape over Mr.Sinclair's mouth.

264
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,560
- 他在浪费我的时间 - 你想继续说吗 法兰克?
- He's wasting my time. - Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

265
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,850
记得波斯湾战争中
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

266
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:08,690
CNN播出的精准导弹攻击报导吗?
Those surgical hits made by our smart bombs, covered so well on CNN?

267
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:13,460
是我在地面的手下用雷射瞄准目标而有此表现的
It was my men on the ground that made those hits possible by lasing the targets.

268
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:17,000
在战争之后 有二十人在巴格达壮烈牺牲
Twenty of them were left to rot outside Baghdad after the conflict ended.

269
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:21,130
他们的家人没有得到补偿 也没有获颁任何勋章
No benefits were paid to their families. No medals conferred.

270
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:28,180
他们为国捐驱 却得不到军方的葬礼
These men died for their country, and they weren't even given a goddamn military burial.

271
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,020
情况已让人忍无可忍
The situation is unacceptable.

272
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,810
你们从红海贸易公司
You will transfer $100 million from the Grand Cayman...

273
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:37,720
将一亿美元的金额转汇入我指定的帐户
Red Sea Trading Company account to an account I designate.

274
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:40,690
这笔款项之中
From these funds, reparations of $1 million will be paid...

275
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:43,230
83名军人遗属将会各得一百万元
to each of the 83 marines' families.

276
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,800
至于余款我则会妥善散发
The rest of the funds I will disperse at my discretion.

277
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,130
我说得够清楚吗?
Do I make myself clear?

278
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,600
除了红海贸易公司 那是什么?
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that?

279
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:55,640
- 表明身份 - 我是联邦调查局局长沃麦 将军
- Identify yourself. - This is FBI Director Womack, General.

280
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:59,310
那是五角大厦非法军售的地下基金
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

281
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,920
拜托 法兰克 这是最高机密
Jesus, Frank! This is classified information.

282
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,420
你们若通知媒体 我就发射毒气导弹
You alert the media, I launch the gas.

283
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:08,520
你们若拒不付钱 我也会发射毒气导弹
You refuse payment, I launch the gas.

284
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,630
你们后天中午之前 还有40小时可以安排把钱汇入
You've got 40 hours, 'til noon day after tomorrow to arrange transfer of the money.

285
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:16,630
我知道反制措施 你知我也知 那一点也没用
I am aware of your countermeasure. You know and I know it doesn't stand a chance.

286
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,730
这是汉默从恶魔岛发话 通话完毕
Hummel from Alcatraz. Out.

287
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,070
我们必须查明人质的身份 并个别通知他们的家属
All right.

288
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,730

We have to identify the hostages and contact each of their families.

289
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,430
我要你们设法捏造理由 绝对不能泄密
Uh, tell 'em something . Make up a story, and we've got to keep this undercover.

290
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,740
消息一旦泄露 旧金山将会一片混乱
If this comes out, the city of San Francisco will be in chaos. I am talking anarchy.

291
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,140
等等等等 一枚VX毒气导弹
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What is the potential casualty rate...

292
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:42,120
潜在的杀伤力有多大?
for a single rocket armed with V.X. poison gas, General Peterson?

293
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:45,780
- 六至七吧 - 那还好嘛
- Sixty or seventy. - Well, that's, that's not so bad.

294
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,090
单位是万 有七万人会死亡
Thousand. Seventy thousand dead!

295
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,820
- 哦 - 一汤匙毒气掉到地上…
- Oh. - One teaspoon of this hits the floor,

296
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,470
一百尺内的人畜皆亡
it's lethal up to a hundred feet.

297
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:58,970
一汤匙毒气在空中引爆…
One teaspoon of this shit detonated in the atmosphere...

298
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,340
八条街以内的生物将会无一幸免
will kill every living organism in an eight-block radius.

299
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,910
明白了吗?
Get the point?

300
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,880
汉默说的反制措施是指什么呢?
Uh, what did Hummel mean by your countermeasure, General?

301
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:11,540
汽油燃烧弹能够把一般毒气烧光
Standard poison is countered by napalm. It burns it up, consumes it upon detonation.

302
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,710
但VX毒气导弹的设计却是能抵抗汽油燃烧弹
Now, the problem with V.X. poison gas is that it's designed specifically...

303
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:19,120
因此才会发展铝热剂
to withstand napalm.That's where thermite plasma comes in.

304
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,950
- 将军 请您继续 铝热剂燃烧弹的热度够高 足以消耗VX毒气
- General Peterson? - Thermite plasma incendiary systems....

305
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,050
但是还在测试之中 还不能上线
can burn hot enough to consume V.X. but they're still in the test phase;

306
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,670
汉默一清二楚
it's not operational. Hummel knows this.

307
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,730
我们在跟一个聪明的混蛋打交道呢
We are dealing with one smart son of a bitch.

308
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,710
在36小时内
What's it gonna take to equip a flight of F-18s...

309
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,240
能不能把铝热剂准备好?
with thermite plasma... within the next 36 hours?

310
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:41,810
- 只有靠上帝了 - 你说什么?
- An act of God. - Excuse me?

311
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,280
我们尽力而为
All right, we can try.

312
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,290
不过我建议将此列为辅助对策
But I strongly urge you to consider the use of this as a secondary initiative.

313
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,790
那我们必须采取主要对策了 上将
Then we have to go to our primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

314
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,400
我要请特遣队队长安德逊来参与行动
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL ground commander, Commander Anderson.

315
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,190
沃麦先生 你们局里最顶尖的生化专家是谁?
Mr. Womack, who is your best chemical/biological man?

316
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,730
有意思
Oh, that's interesting.

317
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,770
- 呃 - 很吸引人
- Oh, yeah. - That's very compelling.

318
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,200
你喜欢我的辫子吗?
You like my pigtails?

319
00:25:10,210 --> 00:25:13,110
你的辫子很俏皮
Oh, yeah, the pigtails are very naughty.

320
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,180
很性感
Naughty. Naughty.

321
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:19,010
意大利奶油和桃红点心
Just the Amaretto cream with peach sorbet persuasion.

322
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,950
不会吧
This isn't happening.

323
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,350
- 别接电话 - 不会这样吧
- No, Stan, don't answer it. - This isn't happening!

324
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,930
- 别去接 - 我一定得接
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay. - I have to.

325
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,220
- 我一定得接 他们知道我在家 - 别
- I have to. It's the office,baby. They know I'm home. - No.

326
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:33,200
- 他们怎么会知道你在家呢 - 他们是联邦调查局
- How could they possibly know that you're home? - It's the FBl.

327
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:39,300
史丹利… 我是古斯比
Stanley! Goodspeed.

328
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,140
对…好吧 我就下去
Uh, yeah. O-Okay, yeah. I'll be, I'll be down,

329
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,210
- 我十分钟后就下楼 - 不行
- downstairs in ten minutes. - No, you won't.

330
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,820
- 我得去旧金山 - 不 你不能去
- I have to go to San Francisco. - No, you don't.

331
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:55,250
史丹利 你不必去旧金山
Stanley, no, you do not have to go to San Francisco.

332
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:58,090
你现在在跟我开玩笑吗? 你必须要留下来 我们有些事要谈清楚
Are you kidding me right now? You need to stay here and talk to me about things.

333
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,230
- 我得走了 宝贝 - 我可是天主教徒
- I've got to go, baby. - Oh! I am Catholic!

334
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,730
你明白这一点吗? 我未婚怀孕 这
Do you realize that? I am pregnant and I am unmarried.

335
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,230
对我来说问题可大了
And this causes a serious problem for me.

336
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,230
我真不能相信你
I cannot believe you.

337
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,380
不要
No, no.

338
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,020
我爱你
I love you.

339
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:27,550
我会娶你 我只是没有预期你会怀孕
I will marry you. I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

340
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,590
你也来旧金山吧
Come to San Francisco.

341
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,730
- 真的吗? - 是啊 我相信这只是例行训练
- Really? - Yeah, I'm sure it's just a training exercise.

342
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,120
我们住旅馆 点些香槟喝
Check into the hotel. Order up some champagne.

343
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:38,320
- 继续我们的游戏 - 没错
- And we'll finish what we started? - Exactly.

344
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:40,590
- 你会娶我吗? - 当然
- Baby, you're gonna marry me? - You know it.

345
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,960
你要娶我? 亲爱的 得了
You're gonna marry me! Oh, honey, come on.

346
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:46,770
- 亲爱的 很快就好了 - 噢…我得走了
- Just a really quick one. - Oh, oh, I gotta go now.

347
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,100
月圆之夜在夜间空降是行不通的
A nighttime airdrop incursion is out due to the full moon.

348
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:52,200
同样的 抢滩攻击也不行
Likewise a frontal seaside attack.

349
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,280
如果我们被汉默发现 他会发射导弹的
If we're compromised and shots are fired, Hummel might launch.

350
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:58,080
唯一可行的方法 是从监狱内部攻击
Our only alternative is an attack from within the prison.

351
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,620
我们从监狱底部的隧道潜入中央地区
We penetrate the island through the tunnels under the prison buildings undetected...

352
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,950
那样我们就能由后方突击那些陆战队员
and emerge in its center! that way we can jump the marines from behind.

353
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:08,530
如果我们幸运的话 也许不必动武就能够夺回导弹
And if we're lucky, take their rocket positions without a shot fired.

354
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:11,290
我想知道 你研究过建筑蓝图吗?
I don't understand. You-you've studied the architectural plans?

355
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:15,160
没有用 恶魔岛重新翻修过多次
They're useless. Alcatraz has been ripped up and rebuilt for years.

356
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,270
- 地底下就像迷宫 - 毫无疑问
- Under there is a maze of shit. - Well, there's no question, gentlemen.

357
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,840
我们需要熟悉那些地道的专家
We need firsthand intelligence of the tunnel systems.

358
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:24,210
- 前任典狱长呢? - 一九七九年就死了
- So what about the former warden? - Died in 1979.

359
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,610
我们联络过其他的狱警 都没有用
All the guards we contacted were useless.

360
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,910
我知道有人帮的上忙
Um, there is someone who I think can help us.

361
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,790
这是为了国家安全
This is for the sake of national security.

362
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,230
就是为了国家安全 33年前才会这样做
No! It's the sake of national security that got us here in the first place 33 years ago.

363
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:44,730
我就知道有一天我们会被反噬 想都别想!
I knew! I knew someday this would come back to bite us.Forget it!

364
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,890
- 他不存在 - 他的确存在!
- He does not exist. - He does exist!

365
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:51,540
三十年来我们只是选择把他忘掉 我们把他关起来
He does exist! We just chose to forget him for 30 years. We locked him up and threw away the key.

366
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,770
然后让他永不见天日
Oh, and a lot of goddamn good it did us.

367
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:57,170
他曾从两座高安全措施的监狱逃出来过 如果被他逃到街上…
He broke out of two maximum-security prisons. And if he hits the streets...

368
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,540
他不会逃到街上的
He's not gonna hit the streets, Jim.

369
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,620
三十年前 他是皇家特种部队的顶尖情报员
Thirty years ago he was a highly-trained SAS operative.

370
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,520
他现在已跟我一样老了 我每晚还得爬起来上三次厕所呢
He is my age now,for Christ's sake! I have to get up three times a night to take a piss.

371
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,060
我们不能冒险放他出来
We can't risk letting him out.

372
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:13,490
他是专业的逃狱专家
He's a professional escape artist.

373
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,690
莎士比亚 孙子兵法

374
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,970
- 乖乖 真…真帅的飞机啊 - 古斯比博士 我是沃麦
- Neat, neat plane. - Dr. Goodspeed.James Womack.

375
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,570
- 幸会 - 欢迎

00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,980
我七岁开始做化学实验 烧掉了自己的眉毛
Got my first chemistry set when I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,950
那只猫也此消失了 我从那时起就爱上了这门学问
We never saw the cat again. Been into it ever since.

382
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,420

384
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,220
事实上 就像香槟一样 修道士正在酿造白酒
Actually, it's kind of like champagne that way. The Franciscan monks thought...

385
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,730
无意中加入二氧化碳 然后香槟就诞生…
they were making white wine.Somehow the bottle carbonated.Voila! Champagne.

386
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:26,300
- VX毒气 古斯比博士 - 十分可怕 长官
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed. - It's very, very horrible, sir.

387
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:29,160
那东西是不应该被发明出来的
It's one of those things we wish we could disinvent.

388
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:32,740
这不是例行训练
This isn't a "train" exercise, is it?

389
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,310
没错 古斯比博士 这不是例行训练
No, Dr. Goodspeed, it's not a training exercise.

390

- How do you do, sir? - It's been a fairly interesting day so far.

395

犯人已经在这里了
The prisoner's here. Shall we?

396
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,360
我的属下找不到他的档案
Now, my boys, they haven't been able to find a file on this guy.

397

一九六三年逃狱
escaped in '63.

400
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:44,210
- 我以为没人逃出恶魔岛 - 派斯顿 别跟我争辩
- I was under the impression that no one ever escaped Alcatraz, sir. - Paxton, don't argue!

401
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,480
这个人在美国和英国都没有身份
This man has no identity, not in the United States or Great Britain.

402
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,810
他不存在 懂吗? 我只要知道
He does not exist. Understand? I want one thing:

403
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,860
他是怎么逃出恶魔岛的 特别是他逃亡的路径
how he escaped The Rock.Specifically, the route he took through the island's bowels.

404
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,960

我们准备完全赦免他 还有…派斯顿
We're prepared to offer him a full pardon.

406
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,630
别对梅森来硬的 我太了解他了
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason. I know him too well.

407
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,530
如果你了解他 为何你不亲自去问他呢?
Well, if you know him, then why don't you question him?

408
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:11,540
他记得我 我不希望他的愤怒搞砸整件事
No, he'll remember me. I don't want his anger clouding the issue.

409
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,610
我搞定他吧
All right, I'll take care of him.

410
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,720
梅森先生 我是负责人 厄尼・派斯顿
Mr. Mason, I'm Special Agent in Charge, Ernest Paxton.

411
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,550
负责什么? 负责再多关我三十年?
In charge of what? Fucking me over for another three decades?

412
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:33,630
我不晓得你的过去 我之所以来此是因为
I don't know anything about your previous matters. I'm here because...

413
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:37,290
我们面临一个特别的状况 我们认为你可能帮得上忙
a special situation exists that we feel you might be able to help us with.

414
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,930
那会是什么事? 我被关得还比曼德拉还久
Now,what might that be? I've been in jail longer than Nelson Mandela,

415
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:43,430
你要我当总统?
so maybe you want me to run for president.

416
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,600
- 不是 - 可惜
- Not exactly. - Mmm, a pity.

417
00:31:46,810 --> 00:31:49,370
- 我好比阿格米达 - 谁?
- I feel rather like Alcamenes. - Who?

418
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,630
阿格米达 在古希腊时代被国王所囚禁
Alcamenes. He was imprisoned by his king in ancient Greece.

419
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:56,520
华特莱理爵士也一样 拥有相同遭遇
Like Sir Walter Raleigh. The same fate.

420
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,550
- 詹姆士一世 - 像你一样聪明的人
- James the First. - Even someone as bright as you

421
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,890
该知道历史会重演
must be aware that, uh,there's a certain pattern emerging here.

422
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,830
- 还有亚历山大・索忍・尼辛 - 我知道
- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn? - Yeah, I heard of him.

423
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:10,430
他是帮共产党摇旗呐喊的家伙
Didn't he play hockey for the fucking Red Wings?

424
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,000
- 就是他 - 我们干脆明讲吧 老兄
- That's the chap. - Get this straight, pops.

425
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,470
我们互不欣赏
I don't like you any more than you like me.

426
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,970
但我来此是要向你提出合理的条件
But I'm here to make you a legitimate offer.

427
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:20,270
你到底想不想听?
You wanna hear what I have to say or not?

428
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:24,170
尽管说吧 亲爱的派斯顿
By all means, dear Paxton. By all means.

429
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:27,410
我们在一个你所熟悉的地方遇到了麻烦
We got a problem in a place that I think you know.

430
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,110
恶魔岛上有人质危机
There's a hostage situation on Alcatraz.

431
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,950
- 人质? - 81名观光客
- Hostage? - Eighty-one tourists.

432
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,120
恶魔岛变成观光胜地?
The Rock has become a tourist attraction?

433
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:41,650
废话少说 你对恶魔岛t如指掌 你从那里逃过狱
Why don't we cut the shit, huh? You know The Rock.You broke out.

434
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,530
- 对 我成功了 - 好
- Yes, successfully. - Yeah.

435
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,070
只要你肯帮我们这个忙
So why don't you do yourself a favor while you're helping us?

436
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:50,030
趁还活着赶快出狱多好
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail while you're still vertical.

437
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,300
趁你那话儿还有用的时候
Hmm? While you got a little lead left in your pencil.

438
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,810
在我考虑你的条件的期间
While I'm considering your offer...

439
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,040
我要住进费蒙饭店的套房
I want a suite in the Fairmont Hotel.

440
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,020
我是来这里谈条件的
You know I'm here to cut you a deal.

441
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:09,450
我可不是来被你耍着玩的
I am not here to bend over and take it up the ass from you.

442
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:12,890
来 我给你个铜板
Here. Here's a quarter.

443
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:19,960
帮你自己一个忙吧 打电话通知你的律师
Do yourself a favor. Call your lawyer.

444
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,000
你得回到牢里
You're going back to jail.

445
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,100
- 你要把他送回监狱? - 我哪里都不送他去
- Y-You're sending him back to jail? - I'm not sending him anywhere.

446
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,230
我只是要让他好好想想
I'm just giving him something to think about.

447
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:33,670
我们没时间让他坐下来仔细的想
I don't think we have time for him to just sit around and think about it.

448
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,180
- 是吗? - 对 古斯比说的对 你去和他谈
- Oh, really? - No, Goodspeed's right. You go talk to him.

449
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,650
- 我? - 对! 长官 我还不够资格呢
- Me? Sir, I'm not qualified for that. - Yes.

450
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:43,990
- 你是FBI探员 - 你的专长是什么?
- You're an FBI agent! - W-What is your specialty again?

451
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,790
- 化学武器 - 这点提都别提
- Chemical weapons. - Don't mention that!

452
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,100
- 你要我说谎? - 没错 说谎
- You want me to lie? - Yeah, lie.

453
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,640
我们剩不到二十四小时了 你就试试看吧
We got less than 24 hours. Give it a shot.

454
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,410
好吧
Okay.

455
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,740

00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:13,310
FBI的人

458
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,890
我叫史丹利・古斯比
Eh, well, my... I'm Stanley Goodspeed.

459
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:21,430
- 当然 - 至少他名字没说错
- But of course you are. - Well, at least he got his name right.

460
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:26,030
- 我当然是 - 你们有紧急状况
- Of course I am. Huh. - And you have an emergency.

461
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:29,570
是的
That's right.

462
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,970
- 你们需要我帮忙 - 一点也没错
- And you need my help. - Exactly right.

463
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,080
咖啡
Coffee.

464
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,670
不用 我不喝 谢谢
No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

465
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,780
给我喝咖啡
Offer me coffee.

466
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:44,210
是的 我正要问
Oh, yes! Well, that was, in fact, gonna be my next...

467
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:47,120
来杯咖啡好吗?
Can we get a cup of coffee in here, please?

468
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:50,090
再解开这些东西
And offer to take these off.

469
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,450
梅森先生 真的…
Mr. Mason, really.

470
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,760
表示你们的诚意
- All kidding aside. - As a gesture of your good faith.

471
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:02,830
- 犯人要求把手铐解开 - 不 不
- Prisoner requests to have his handcuffs taken off. - No, no, no, no.

472
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:07,340
请你们解开他的手铐
Why don't you go ahead and have his handcuffs taken off, please?

473
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:10,000
我想这也是个办法
Well, I guess that's one way to go.

474
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,310
这是司法部长的赦免令
This is a pardon and release contract from the Attorney General's office.

475
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,890
只要你愿意合作 你就可重获自由
Now, it makes you a free man provided you cooperate.

476
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:25,360
如果你签名 就在上面写…
So if you'll just, uh, sign... uh, at, uh, where it says...

477
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:28,710
- 签名的地方? - 没错
- "Signature"? - That's... Yes. "Signature."

478
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:34,330
拉丁文
Well, timeo danaos et dona ferentis.

479
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,670
我害怕希腊人 连他们送礼都得小心
"l fear the Greeks even when they bring gifts."

480
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,240
你很有学问
Oh, an educated man!

481
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,210
由那看来 你肯定不是实务探员
That rules out the possibility of you being a field agent.

482
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:48,520
老实说 我是实务探员 梅森先生
In point of fact, I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

483
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:50,740
- 真的吗? - 没错
- Really? - Yes.

484
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:54,480
- 是哪个领域的? - 反恐怖行动
- In which field? - Antiterrorism.

485
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:58,650
你是武器爆破和搏击专家
Then you're trained in weaponry, explosives and mortal combat.

486
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,730
训练精良
Well-trained.

487
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:04,100
带我到费蒙饭店
Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

488
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,520
好吧
Okay.

489
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:12,830
我要住套房洗澡刮胡子
I want a suite, a shower, a shave...

490
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:15,270
还有一套西装
and the feel of a suit.

491
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:18,540
我可以建议你也剪个头发吗?
May I also suggest, uh, a haircut?

492
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:22,170
- 这样不流行吗? - 除非你是西雅图来的年方二十的吉他手
- Am I out of style? - Unless you're a 20-year-old guitarist from Seattle.

493
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:25,390
- 那是邋遢型 - 邋遢型?
- It's a grunge thing. - Grunge?

494
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,320
好吧 谢谢你
Yeah, well, uh, uh... Okay, thank you very much.

495
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,550
好了 联络费蒙饭店 必要时封闭楼层
All right. Call the Fairmont. Close the floor if necessary,

496
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,040
我要他与外界隔离 给他最多两个钟头时间
but I want him sealed off. And he gets two hours max.

497
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:54,140
- 干得好 古斯比 - 何不请他到大溪地度假?
- Great job, Goodspeed. - Why didn't you throw in a trip to Tahiti while you were at it?

498
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,150
我把这要交给司法部
I'll deliver this to the Attorney General.

499
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,310
不 把它给我
Ah,no,you'll give it to me. Reynolds. And take Attorney Reynolds outside.

你并不清楚实际状况 古斯比
You're not acquainted with the full facts, Goodspeed.

503
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:15,670

With all due respect, sir, I'd like clarification. I gave that man my word.

504
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,640

Damn it! You're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.

505
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:24,040

It's, uh, it's, eh, kind of curious, but, uh,

别动手…
Eh, peace! Peace!

511
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,070
没人在家 请留话
Hey, we're not home. Leave a message.

Who's Carla? And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco?

517
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:26,090
这是最高机密 你没必要知道
You're on a need-to-know basis, and you don't need to know.

523
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:52,360
我放在袜柜里
I left it in my, uh, my sock drawer.

524
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:55,400
你要枪?
A gun?

525
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,540
要来干嘛? 你只是个化学狂
For what? You're a chemical freak.

526
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,700
事实上我是个超级化学狂 但我还是需要一把枪
No, I'm a chemical super-freak, actually. But I still need a gun.

527
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,850
给他一把枪
Give him a goddamn gun.

528
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,080
毕业后你开过枪吗?
Have you fired one of those things since the Academy?

529
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:16,250
"If you're going to San Francisco"

530
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:20,950
"Don't forget to wear flowers in your hair"

531
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,600
"If you're going to San Francisco"

532
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,470
"You're sure to meet some gentle people there"

533
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:35,800
- "gentle people there" - "And you come for... "

534
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,810
"If you're going to San Francisco"

535

- Barber. - Just clippers. No scissors.

541
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:57,030
不准用剪刀? 你一定是在跟我开玩笑
No scissors? You've got to be kidding me, no scissors!

542
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,460
你会叫毕加索不准用画笔吗?
I mean, did they tell Picasso, "No brush"?

543
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:01,400
这个人能用剪刀杀人
With scissors, this man could kill you.

544
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:05,440
我用电动剪刀 割不了任何人的鸟蛋吧?
I can't cut anyone's balls off with a trimmer now, can l?

545
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:11,040
咱们何不到阳台去晒点太阳
Why don't we do this outside? Get some sun.

546
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:15,740
谁帮你剪的头发 真是遭透了逊毙了
Oh, who did this to you? This is just not right. In fact, it's nasty!

547
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:19,720
这是邋遢型 的确很邋遢
Well, it's a grunge thing. Well, it's some kind of thing.

548
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:22,880
你想我们有没有时间可以顺便护发和染发?
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp protein pack and maybe some color?

549
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,890
- 没有 - 好吧
- No. - Okay.

550
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,190

没错
No, he's not.

552
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,610
'Cause I'm leaving

00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,770
有人点的 别浪费食物
Hey,Can't let it go to waste.

554
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,080
你嘴巴停不下来吗?
Don't you ever stop eating ?

555
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,250
食物免费的时候例外
Not when it's free.

556
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,720
- 我们在执勤 - 别担心 他只是个老头子
- We're supposed to be on duty. - Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

557
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,830
老板在看着他 来嘛 来吃点龙虾
The boss is watching 'im. Come on. Have... Try some of this lobster.

558
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:06,560
- 嗯嗯 - 我的秘书会跟你结帐
- Mm-hmm. - My secretary here will settle the bill.

559
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,360
办完事后你打算怎么处置我呢? 沃麦
So what do you have in store for me, Womack, when this is over?

560
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:13,230
你可以重获自由
You'll get your life back, Mason.

561
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:16,400
你早就可以让我重获自由的
But you could've given me my life back years ago.

562
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,380
我现在为什么要相信你呢
Why should I trust you now?

563
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,520
我说话算话
You've got my word.

564
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,620
咱们握个手
Will you shake on it?

565
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,220
别动 先生

Okay, I don't wanna know nothing . I never saw you throw that gentleman off the balcony.

635
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,350
我是史黛西 是洁的朋友
No, Stacy. Jade's friend.

636
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,000
你不敢一个人来?
Were you afraid to come alone?

637
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,330
没错
Yeah.

638
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:34,750
没关系
It's okay.

639
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,300
如果有需要我就在那儿
I'll be over here if you need me.

640
00:50:37,510 --> 00:50:41,940
上回看到照片你才十岁
The last photograph I had of you, you were about ten.

641
00:50:42,870 --> 00:50:48,510
母亲去世后 我找到你的照片
Well, I found a picture of you among my mom's things when she died.

642
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,520
呃...
Oh, yeah? Well, uh...

643

644
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,930
你母亲 她很特别
Your mother, uh... Yeah, well, sh-she was very special.

645
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,530
是的 没错
Yeah, she was.

646
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:08,330
但别把你和她之间的事想得太浪漫了
But I don't think we should romanticize what happened between you and her.

647
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:11,100
在齐柏林合唱团演唱会后 在酒吧搭上
Meeting in a bar after a Led Zeppelin concert.

648
00:51:11,310 --> 00:51:14,540
结果 我就出生了
Head out, and I was the result.

649
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:18,080
我们本来会有好的结果 只可惜…
Well, I'd like to think it would've led somewhere if only...

650
00:51:18,110 --> 00:51:20,080
只可惜什么?
If only what? Six federal marshals...

651
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:23,240
可惜你硬是被警察逮回大牢去了?
hadn't kicked down our door and dragged you back to prison?

652
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:25,440
对不起
I'm sorry.

653
00:51:25,650 --> 00:51:28,710
没关系
It's all right.

654
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,820
- 你被放出来了? - 是的
- So, they let you out? - Yeah.

655
00:51:33,030 --> 00:51:35,860
很好
That's good.

656
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,960
你到底犯了什么罪?
What did you do?

657
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:48,240
洁 我的时间不多
Jade, I don't have a great deal of time here.

658
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:54,810
但我会回来找你的 也许我们可以…
But I'll be coming back. And, uh, Maybe we can...

659
00:51:55,020 --> 00:51:56,570
怎样? 我们可以怎样?
What? We can what?

660
00:51:58,250 --> 00:52:03,990
你知道吗? 只有你能证明我的存在
You know, you're almost the only evidence that I exist.

661
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:06,560
但我不了解你
But I don't know you.

662
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:09,290
那是可以改变的
That's what I want to change, eh?

663
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:18,060
我不断地练习 见到你我该说些什么
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand times on the chance that we would meet.

664
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:20,760
我们见面了…我却语塞了
Here we are, and I'm lost.

665
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:24,340
我也不知道该怎么想
Well, I don't know how I'm supposed to be feeling either.

666
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,940
洁 我不是坏人
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

667
00:52:28,150 --> 00:52:31,610
你若相信 那就是好的开始
If you can believe that, then it's a start.

668
00:52:34,410 --> 00:52:37,290
好吧
Okay.

669
00:52:48,370 --> 00:52:50,530
他们是来找你的?
Is this about you?

670
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:06,510
你又逃狱了 对吧?
You broke out of prison again, didn't you?

671
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,210
- 你为何来找我呢? - 联邦探员 小姐
- Why did you come to me? - FBl, ma'am.

672
00:53:09,390 --> 00:53:13,790
令尊为我们工作 他正在帮忙我们解决致命的危机
Your father's working with us. He's helping us resolve a dangerous situation.

673
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,020
- 真的? - 没错 小姐
- He is? - Yes, ma'am.

674
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:19,530
约翰 我想我们该走了吧
Well, gee whiz, John, I guess we oughta get going , huh?

675
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:22,900
随你吩咐 史丹利
Whatever you say, Stanley.

676
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:30,510
谢谢你 你大可不必那样做的
Thank you for that. You could've handled it differently.

677
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,940
我们废话少说吧 混球
What do you say we cut the chitchat, a-hole?

678
00:53:34,120 --> 00:53:38,050
差点害死我两次 我的下巴痛死了
You almost got me killed twice. And my jaw hurts like hell!

679
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,980
- 很好 - 卑鄙的家伙!
- Good. - Cocksucker!

680
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:44,520
我应该把你送回大牢
If I had my way, you would be shipped back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

681
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:47,060
让你的余生永远不见天日
and caged like an animal for the rest of your natural fucking life!

682
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,060
你毁了半个旧金山
You wrecked half the city!

683
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:56,330
- 帮个忙 - 请你说明地下隧道
- Give me a hand with the system. - Now, tell me about the tunnels.

684
00:53:56,570 --> 00:54:00,230
只要摸熟整个系统 你哪儿都能去
If you know the system, it will take you wherever you need to go.

685
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:05,870
这里有个水管入口 它低于水面 那是我们最佳的入口吗?
There's an intake pipe here, below low tide. Is that our best access?

686
00:54:06,050 --> 00:54:09,310
- 对 我就是从这儿逃出 - 贮水池底下
- Yes. That's exactly where I had come out. - Then beneath the cistern,,,

687
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,850
连结着污水处理系统
there's a connection to the abandoned septic system.

688
00:54:12,020 --> 00:54:16,820
- 那有多长? - 嗯…57步
- How many feet is that? - Ehh... 57 paces.

689
00:54:16,990 --> 00:54:19,020
然后要怎么走?
Where do we go from there?

690
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:24,560
要怎么走?
Where do we go from there?

691
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,130
问得好
That's a good question.

692
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,500
- 我不晓得 - 什么?
- I have no idea. - What?

693
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:35,940
我是说 进去了我才知道
I mean, I'll know it when we're all inside.

694
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,540
你不能去 用蓝图跟我们解释
No. You're not goddamn going . Show us on the blueprints.

695
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:43,080
不行 我的蓝图在我脑里
I can't! My blueprint was in my head.

696
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,620
我曾经在黑暗中潜伏在地底三天
I was underground for three days in the dark...

697
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:49,880
等待正确的潮汐到来
just waiting for the tides to be right.

698
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,150
别担心 我会记起来的
But don't worry. It'll all come back to me.

699
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:55,390
你哪儿都别想去 梅森
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

700
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:57,030
等等 他可能是他们唯一的希望
Wait a second.

701
00:54:57,230 --> 00:55:01,570
Now this piece of work might be the only chance those people over there have.

702
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:04,430
如果他不去 那我们放他出来干嘛?
If he's not going, then why the hell did we get him out of jail?

703
00:55:04,610 --> 00:55:07,730
- 他很聪明 - 他只能指路 不能跟去
- He's smart. - I got him out to get you people in, not go with you.

704
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:11,780
如果他是唯一清楚的人 他就得去了
If it's the only way of getting the intelligence I need, then he goes.

705
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:13,810
他会害你们
He'll fuck with you.

706
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:17,680
你若敢害我兄弟 我会让你死的很惨
You compromise my men's lives, and I'll bury you out there.

707
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:24,490
沃麦 我看你别无选择了
Now, Womack...you're between The Rock and a hard case.

708
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:29,380
你的手没事吧?
How is your bowling arm?

709
00:55:32,190 --> 00:55:36,030
古斯比博士 目标是要摧毁发射架 并且拆除VX毒气弹
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal is to take out the launchers, then neutralize the V.X. chemical rounds.

710
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,760
我们从卫星感热图看出 导弹在停尸间
Well, we know the poison's being kept in the prison morgue...

711
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,340
就是这里 颜色变深的地方
from the satellite thermal imaging, which is right here... these colorized dots.

712
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,500
你看过真正的毒气导弹吗?
Have you ever actually seen one of these devices?

713
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,610
不 我只研究过
No, sir, but I've studied them.

714
00:55:46,810 --> 00:55:50,220
我该开始教你们如何拆除导弹引信并解毒
I should really begin briefing your guys on defusing and detoxification.

715
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:53,250
我这里有张图 是毒胶囊和导弹的结构详图
Got a really neat layout over here of the chem round as well as the rocket...

716
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,910
- 我们就开始吧 - 没有必要
- so let's get rolling. - That won't be necessary.

717
00:55:57,860 --> 00:56:00,420
非常有必要
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

718
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:03,430
这种毒气的杀伤力惊人
The power of this chemical is way beyond anything you can imagine.

719
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,190
会造成生态浩劫的
An ecological disaster, sir.

720
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,770
再加上它的设计相当复杂
Plus the devices themselves are complicated.

721
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:11,700
所以你得跟来
That's why you're coming with us.

722
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,030
是吗?
I am?

723
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,370
你是专家 有问题吗?
You're the expert. What's your problem?

724
00:56:18,550 --> 00:56:22,710
我得跟去? 一起潜到水底?
You mean I'm going, going out there, under the water?

725
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:27,750
你今天早上不是要枪吗? 你现在有枪和潜水衣了
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun. Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

726
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:29,890
你参加过战斗吗?
Have you ever been in a combat situation?

727
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,150
- 请解释战斗的定义 - 薜普
- Define "combat," sir. - Shep?

728
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:36,160
袭击在强固碉堡内的
An incursion underwater to retake an impregnable fortress...

729
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,960
海陆精英 救出人质
held by an elite team of U.S. Marines in possession of 81 hostages...

730
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,690
夺回十五枚毒气导弹
and 15 guided rockets armed with V.X. poisoned gas.

731
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:47,100
这么说来 我没有参加过 失陪一下
Oh. In that case, no, sir. Excuse me.

732
00:56:53,610 --> 00:56:56,010
谢谢你
- Here. - Ah, thank you.

733
00:56:58,390 --> 00:57:00,720
你脸色不太好
You don't look too good.

734
00:57:00,890 --> 00:57:03,410
事实上简直是糟透了
In fact, you look like shit.

735
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:07,690
我的肚子在天翻地复
My stomach's doing hula hoops around my ass.

736
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:11,590
你没事吧?
You all right? 

737
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:12,830
I mean, you gonna make it through this thing?
我是说 你办得到吗?

738
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:14,030
我不知道
I don't know.

739
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:17,140
我知道一定会面对这种事
I always expected something like this was going to happen...

740
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:19,310
怎么准备都没用的
but nothing prepares you for it.

741
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,670
现在整个城市的命运
Now I'm... I'm responsible...

742
00:57:22,810 --> 00:57:25,400
都系在我的手中
for a whole city.

743
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:29,450
我知道这对你而言并不简单
Look,I Know this isn't easy for you.

744
00:57:29,620 --> 00:57:31,920
你受过这方面的训练
Remember, you were trained for this kind of a situation...

745
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:33,920
你会想得起来的
and believe me, it'll come back to you.

746
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,650
更何况还有全国最顶尖的特遣队会帮你
Besides, you got the best SEAL team in the country backing you up.

747
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,190
好吧 你说得对
Okay. You're right.

748
00:57:41,630 --> 00:57:44,560
我会在无线电上指点你
I- l'll be on the wire. I'll help talk you through it.

749
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,130
还有一件事 很糟糕
There's something else. It's terrible.

750
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:53,170
不 很美好 现在却很糟糕
N- No, it's wonderful... except it isn't.

751
00:57:53,370 --> 00:57:57,000
我女友怀孕了
My girlfriend's pregnant...

752
00:57:57,180 --> 00:58:01,340
她正飞来旧金山看我

753
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,140
你今晚尽管专心完成任务
You keep your mind on what you're going to be doing out there tonight.

754
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:08,120
我会派人把你女友接到指挥中心来的
And I'll send someone to pick up your girlfriend and bring her here to the command center.

755
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:23,900

我们跟总统谈过 你知道总统对恐怖行动的立场 所以我们打算…
Now, We've spoken to the president. and I know that you're aware of his stance on terrorism.

760
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:42,850
- 这不是恐怖行动 - 这是关于正义
- So what we'd like to do is... - This isn't about terrorism. This is about justice.

761
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:45,820
也是要提醒你那些你为政治理由而遗弃的人
It's about reminding you people who found it politically convenient to forget.

762

铝热剂好了吗?
What's the word from Mojave?

767
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:08,980
彼得森将军不能保证能够起作用
General Peterson can give us no definite assurance on the thermite plasma.

768
00:59:09,150 --> 00:59:11,120

You breathe, he breathes with you. You piss, he helps.Understood?

775
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,040
古斯博士是位专家 当他解除毒气导弹后
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist. When he neutralizes the threat,

776
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,090
我们就发射绿色信号弹 并等待救援
we launch green flares and we wait for the cavalry.

777
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:01,030
别怀疑 各位 这是最艰巨的一战
Make no mistake, gentlemen. We're in the fight of our lives...

778
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:03,230

Use the green flares to signal when the threat has been neutralized.

792
01:01:25,050 --> 01:01:25,670
这是颠茄素 一旦接触到毒气
Now, this is atropine. If you come in contact with the gas...

793
01:01:25,710 --> 01:01:30,550
在二十秒内注射进心脏
you have 20 seconds to inject it into your heart.

794
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:33,060

你们可不可以告诉我发生什么事了?
Oh, I would just love for you to tell me what is going on.

798
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:53,780
- 不行 - 听着 史丹利・古斯比是我的男朋友…

We only got two flying in. I just lost one.

805
01:02:17,570 --> 01:02:18,660
可恶
Shit!

806
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:31,910
以前我们只靠面罩和蛙鞋
In my day, we did it all with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

807
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:35,140
- 以前? - 你不知道我的资历?
- Your day? - Yes. Didn't you read my resume?

808
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:38,090
我对你一无所知

818
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,660
- 准备出发 - 祝好运 队长

819
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,700
突击一号到达目标区
Sir, Raider One is at the drop zone.

820
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:30,170
史丹利不太会游泳 更别说是潜水了
Stanley's not a very good swimmer. I mean, he can't even snorkel.

821
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:37,100
- 大家准备好了吗? - 好了…
- Everyone, good to go? - Good to go!

822
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,780
部队出发 队员潜入水中

The Eagles are on The Rock. They've entered the cistern room.

Thank you very fucking much,Mr. Mason. You've led us into a room with no exit.

828
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,020
有办法吗?
Any ideas, Dillinger?

829
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:27,890
快点想 咱们现在是坐以待毙 我们时间不多
Figure it out soon. We're sitting ducks.

We're a little tight on time. You stand by the door until I open it.

我倒想知道你打算怎么开门呢?
I'd like to know how you plan on accomplishing that?

从这儿去
Through here.

833
01:05:43,640 --> 01:05:45,470
你在唬我
You're shitting me.

834
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:49,380
我还记得时间差 希望没有改变
I memorized the timing. I just hope it hasn't been changed.

835
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:53,110
你要是被火喷到 你就变成木炭了
You catch one of those flame bursts, you're a corpse.

836
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:56,480
- 谢谢你 - 队长 你叫我紧跟着他的

这里没人 长官 感应器也没有感应
Clear here, sir. No motion sensors tripped.

840
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:41,790
- 没有动静 - 叫他们继续巡逻

向前搜索
Sweep forward!

842
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,040
看来他撇下我们了
Looks like he fucked us, Commander.

843
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:59,010
我就知道 那家伙开溜了
I knew it. That son of a bitch jumped ship.

844

欢迎光临恶魔岛
Welcome to The Rock.

849
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:02,010
至少比牢里好多了
Well, it's certainly more enjoyable than my average day.

850
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:06,170
读读哲学 在厕所还得小心有人会强暴我
Reading philosophy, avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

851
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:10,690
最近情况好多了 我人老珠黄了 也许我已经没有吸引力了
Though it's less of a problem these days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

852
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:18,420
北边的防风栅栏有震动
We've got seismic activity in one of the storm grates. North side.

853

857
01:08:30,710 --> 01:08:34,440
别动
Stand fast.

西边防风栅栏安全

860
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,860
队员抵达隧道入口 就在澡堂底下

864
01:09:45,490 --> 01:09:48,220
动作感应器

865
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:52,550
- 雷射光横射过铁盖 - 搞定它
- Beams cutting across the manhole covers. - Deal with it.

866
01:09:57,000 --> 01:10:00,870
雷射光可能反射在
Commander, the beam is hitting some sort of reflective device.

867
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:02,760
棱镜上
Possibly a prism.

868
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:08,340
我要用镜子把雷射光
I want to use a mirror to cut the beam...

869
01:10:08,510 --> 01:10:11,530
折射回原点

870
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,680
然后我就移开棱镜
and then I'm gonna move the prism.

871
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:20,580
澡堂的震动感应器有动静 长官
We've got motion on a trembler in the shower room, sir.

872
01:10:20,790 --> 01:10:22,870
我们有访客了 走吧

他们进入澡堂了 长官

878
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,800

这是个他妈的陷阱
It's a fucking trap.

883

887
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,930
你就命令他们放下武器

888
01:11:41,170 --> 01:11:42,430
糟了
This is not happening.

889
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:47,970
我们知道你的目的 我也完全同意你
Sir, we know why you're out here. God knows I agree with you.

890
01:11:48,140 --> 01:11:52,240
但我也跟你一样 誓言捍卫祖国抵挡敌人
But like you, I swore to defend this country against all enemies...

891
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:56,440
不论他们是外国人或是本国人
foreign, sir, and domestic.

892
01:11:56,620 --> 01:12:00,990
将军 我们都为这国家洒下热血
General, we've spilled the same blood in the same mud.

893
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,990
你知道我不能下达这个命令
You know goddamn well I can't give that order.

894
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,650
我们死定了
We're dead.

895
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:09,160
我们居高临下 中校
Your unit is covered from an elevated position, Commander.

896
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,990
我不会再要求你了 别做傻事
I'm not gonna ask you again. Don't do anything stupid.

897
01:12:13,200 --> 01:12:15,570
没有人愿意死在这里
No one has to die here.

898
01:12:15,740 --> 01:12:20,000
跟着将军的这些人 你们在海军陆战队誓言效忠国家
Men following the general, you're under oath as United States Marines!

899
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,000
你们忘了吗?
Have you forgotten that?

900
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:25,400
我们都有袍泽丧命战场
We all have shipmates we remember.

901
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:28,840
有些甚至是被五角大厦的人所遗弃
Some of them were shit on and pissed on by the Pentagon.

902
01:12:29,020 --> 01:12:30,940
但你们也无权叛变啊!
But that doesn't give you the right to mutiny!

903
01:12:30,970 --> 01:12:34,980
随你怎么说 我们占了优势
You call it what you want! You're down there, we're up here.

904
01:12:35,190 --> 01:12:36,990
- 你们犯了大错 中校 - 别动
You walked into the wrong goddamn room, Commander!

905
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:39,180
- 别动 - 该死 中校 最后一次
- Stand fast! - Goddamn it, Commander, one last time.

906
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,220
命令你的手下放下武器
You tell your men to safety their weapons, drop 'em on the deck.

907
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:44,060
- 我无法下达那个命令 - 我不想再说一次
- I cannot give that order! - I am not gonna repeat that order!

908
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:47,060
- 我无法下达那个命令 - 你是怎么了?
- I will not give that order! - What the hell is wrong with you, man?

909
01:12:47,230 --> 01:12:49,670
- 别动! 别动… -哦! 天哪!
- Stand fast! - Oh, my God!

910
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,730
- 干掉他们吧 - 我再说一次…
- Let's waste these fuckers. - One last time.

911
01:12:51,910 --> 01:12:56,400
让你的人放下武器
You order your men to safety their weapons......

912
01:13:01,150 --> 01:13:02,980
停火!
Cease fire!

913
01:13:26,740 --> 01:13:28,570
停火!
Cease fire!

914
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:39,350
停火!
Cease fire!

915
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,720
该死可恶! 放开我 放开我
Shit, Goddamn it Let go of me,Let go of me!

916
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:46,260
别去
Don't,don't go.

917
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,090
可恶
Fuck

918
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:37,470
完了
It's over.

919
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,620
天啊
Oh, God!

920
01:15:19,990 --> 01:15:21,750
还有动静
We got some movement.

921
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:25,840
- 两个人 是谁? - 11 12号
- Who? Who is it? - Two of'em. Eagles 11 and 12.

922
01:15:25,870 --> 01:15:27,790
- 古斯比和梅森 - 我就知道
- I-lt's Goodspeed and Mason. - I knew it.

923
01:15:27,960 --> 01:15:30,950
我们得尽快组成第二队 展开第二次的行动
I've gotta get a team together right now. We've gotta move with the second option.

924
01:15:31,160 --> 01:15:32,520
让他们再被屠杀? 不行
What, and invite another massacre? No way.

925
01:15:32,550 --> 01:15:37,300
只剩一只老狐狸和菜鸟 我告诉你 这下没戏唱了
We've got a 60-year-old convict and a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

926
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:40,030
梅森还没玩完 不是吗?
Not for Mason, it isn't.

927
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:55,540
古斯比 我不会杀你的
Goodspeed, I'm not gonna kill you.

928
01:15:58,290 --> 01:16:00,890
- 你上哪儿? - 离开此地
- Where are you going? - Off this bloody island.

929
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:03,030
为什么?
What? Wh-Wh-What for?

930
01:16:03,200 --> 01:16:06,690
古斯比? 古斯比 你收到吗?
Goodspeed. Goodspeed, do you read me?

931
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,230
找你的
It's for you.

932
01:16:10,060 --> 01:16:13,200
- 长官? - 情况如何?
- Sir? - What's the status?

933
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,860
他们全死了 死了
The status is they're dead. They're dead!

934
01:16:16,010 --> 01:16:18,170
只剩我和梅森 梅森正要走
It's just me and Mason. Now he says he's leaving.

935
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,680
不行 听到吗? 不行!
That is unacceptable. Do you hear me? Unacceptable!

936
01:16:21,850 --> 01:16:25,080
有点麻烦 长官 他手上有枪
Well, there's a problem, sir. He's got a gun.

937
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:27,120
你只有水枪吗?
What do you have, a fucking water pistol?

938
01:16:27,290 --> 01:16:31,090
- 不是 - 去阻止他
- No, sir. - Go after him and stop him.

939
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:35,420
我并不想这样
I didn't want this.

940
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:38,190
- 天啊 我并不想这样 - 这是无可避免的 法兰克
- Jesus, I didn't want this. - You knew this might happen, Frank.

941
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:41,390
- 也许他们会付钱给我们 - 也许不会
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up. - Maybe now they won't, Captain.

942
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:44,040
也许我们该处决一些人质
Then maybe we need to execute a few hostages.

943
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:46,870
- 有一个活口 - 打死他
- Got a live one! - Put a bullet in him.

944
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,940
你听到了 解决他
You heard him. End it!

945
01:16:49,080 --> 01:16:51,040
收起手枪
Holster that sidearm, Captain.

946
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:11,500
长官
Sir?

947
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:19,770
你犯了大错 害他们白白牺牲
You made a terrible mistake.And more of our brothers have died in vain.

948
01:17:19,940 --> 01:17:23,880
是你们逼我的
Damn you for forcing me into this position.

949
01:17:27,050 --> 01:17:29,910
我现在就要单独跟你谈谈
I need to talk to you right now, alone.

950
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:32,310
你说这是最高机密
Now you told me I'm on a need-to-know basis.

951
01:17:32,490 --> 01:17:33,370
我现在告诉你
And I'm telling you right now, I need to know...

952
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:37,310
我要知道约翰・梅森的身份 长官
who the fuck John Mason is right now, sir.

953
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:43,110
你真的想知道? 一九六二年 胡佛掌管调查局
All right, you wanna know? 1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

954
01:17:43,150 --> 01:17:44,860
有人说他控管了整个国家
is head of the FBl, some say the country.

955
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:48,930
他秘密调查美国和欧洲的政要
It's no secret he kept microfilm files on prominent Americans and Europeans:

956
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:52,500
戴高乐英国议员和首相
de Gaulle, British members of Parliament, even the prime minister.

957
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,330
他有每个人的秘密档案
I mean, this guy had dirt on everybody in the world.

958
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,510
我听过传闻 这和梅森又有何关系?
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger stories. Where does Mason fit in?

959
01:17:59,680 --> 01:18:02,340
他是偷走档案的英国间谍
Mason was the British operative who stole the files.

960
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:05,180
但我们在加拿大边界逮到他
But our Bureau agents caught him at the Canadian border.

961
01:18:05,350 --> 01:18:08,480
当然英国不承认他的身份
Of course, the British claimed they'd never heard of him.

962
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:13,090
我们将他囚禁 逼他交出胶片
And we held him without trial until he gave up the microfilm,

963
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,160
但是他没有交出来
but he never did.

964
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:18,460
真令人讶异 胡佛没用他女儿逼他
Well, I'm surprised Hoover didn't use his daughter as leverage.

965
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:21,500
胡佛于一九七二年去世 那时她还没出世
Hoover was dead in '72. She wasn't born yet.

966
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:25,070
现在的调查局不同了
Today, well, it's a different Bureau.

967
01:18:25,240 --> 01:18:29,440
他被关了一辈子 没有任何公平的审判 也难怪他会生气
So you held this guy without trial his whole life! No wonder he's pissed.

968
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:33,880
这个人知道美国近半世纪以来的秘密
This man knows our most intimate secrets from the last half century:

969
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:39,130
外星人登陆 杀肯尼迪的真凶 梅森很生气
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth about the J.F.K. assassination.

970
01:18:39,170 --> 01:18:42,850
梅森很危险 他是个职业杀手
And Mason's angry, he's lethal, he's a trained killer.

971
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:47,820
而他也是我们手上唯一的希望
And he is the only hope that we have got.

972
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:52,290
梅森 梅森
Mason! Mason!

973
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,470
上面有81名人质
There are 81 hostages still up there.

974
01:18:55,670 --> 01:18:57,400
是啊 我也是人质
Yeah, like me.

975
01:18:57,570 --> 01:19:00,100
你想来硬的? 你想跟我来硬的?
All right, you wanna play tough? You wanna play tough with me?

976
01:19:00,270 --> 01:19:03,040
好 FBI! 别动 浑蛋
Okay. FBl! Freeze, sucker!

977
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:08,440
- 我会开枪的 - 不 你不会
- I'll fire. - No, you won't.

978
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:13,020
- 放下枪 - 你不是那种人
- Throw down. - You're not the sort.

979
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,020
我们等着瞧吧
Let's find out.

980
01:19:18,590 --> 01:19:21,190
我是 你不是
I could! you, no.

981
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,520
而且保险栓没除下
Besides, your safety's on.

982
01:19:24,730 --> 01:19:28,190
古斯比 你的情况解决了吗?
Goodspeed, have you resolved the situation?

983
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:31,730
还没有
Not yet.

984
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:37,070
- 现在枪都在他手上了 - 该死!
- He's got all the guns now, sir. - Shit!

985
01:19:37,210 --> 01:19:40,240
没错 我不用枪 我也不会踹门
You're right, I don't use guns and I don't kick down doors.

986
01:19:40,270 --> 01:19:42,570
- 这才是我在做的事 - 我没戴眼镜
- This is what I do. - I haven't got my glasses.

987
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:46,910
上面写:化学武器专家
What it says is Chemical Weapons Specialist.

988
01:19:47,090 --> 01:19:48,490
没错
That's right.

989
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:53,750
那疯子有十五枚致命的毒气导弹在上面
I got a lunatic up there, man with 15 missiles...armed with some really funky stuff.

990
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:59,460
沃麦这大骗子 你可以警告我女儿的
That lying Womack. You could've told my daughter.

991
01:19:59,670 --> 01:20:04,100
那是机密 我也面临相同的状况
It was classified. Look, I'm in the same situation.

992
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:07,430
我怀孕的女友也在旧金山
They've got my girlfriend in the city with a baby on the way.

993
01:20:07,610 --> 01:20:11,040
我能拆除导弹 我真的可以
Look, I can defuse the rockets. I really can.

994
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:14,740
不过我现在需要你的帮忙
But I'm gonna need your help, and I'm gonna need it right now.

995
01:20:22,460 --> 01:20:25,150
长官 他的武器和通话机不见了
Sir, this man's weapons and tack radio are missing!

996
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:28,350
该死 有鼠辈横行 把他们揪出来
Shit, we got a rodent problem. Flush the pipes.

997
01:20:28,530 --> 01:20:31,050
底下的隧道像迷宫
There's probably a maze of tunnels on this goddamn island.

998
01:20:31,260 --> 01:20:33,790
- 仔细搜 - 是 长官
- Check every access you can find. - Sir!

999
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:42,110
就算你逃出恶魔岛
Even if you escape from the island...

1000
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,040
也躲不过导弹的
you can't escape the rockets.

1001
01:20:45,210 --> 01:20:47,480
你打算逃到哪儿?
So, where are you gonna go?

1002
01:20:47,650 --> 01:20:50,310
你要到哪里? 你打算做什么?
Go where? What are, what are you gonna do?

1003
01:20:53,150 --> 01:20:55,310
告诉我停尸间在哪儿? 梅森
Show me where the morgue is, Mason.

1004
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,650
我要出去了
I'm out of here.

1005
01:20:59,830 --> 01:21:02,820
你不管你的女儿吗? 梅森?
What about your daughter? Mason?

1006
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,260
找到鼠辈
Rodents located.

1007
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:10,390
我看你别无选择 对吧?
The way I see it, you don't really have any choice, do you?

1008
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:12,760
我不认为你有
I don't think you do.

1009
01:21:24,250 --> 01:21:27,980
快跑!
Move!

1010
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:55,710
- 他们盯上我们了 - 用火把他们烧出来
- They're onto us. - Burn 'em out.

1011
01:21:57,950 --> 01:22:00,110
这玩意可厉害了
This mother's gonna blow big.

1012
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:45,290
我不了解 怎么会突然失去通讯?
I don't understand. How could we lose radio contact all of a sudden?

1013
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:47,990
我们失去通讯了 但雷达还有显示
We've lost coms. Still got 'em on locaters.

1014
01:22:55,160 --> 01:22:59,170
- 你怎么说? - 什么?
- So what's it gonna be? - What?

1015
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:03,730
- 你有别的选择吗? - 没有
- How do you like your choices? - I don't.

1016
01:23:03,820 --> 01:23:07,410
我就这么说
That's what I thought.

1017
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,420
来吧
All right, come on.

1018
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:12,280
这是恶魔岛最古老的地方
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1019
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:15,950
这原来是美国内战的碉堡
Did you know it was originally a Civil War fort?

1020
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,100
真的吗? 你知道吗 我也喜欢历史
Oh, really? Huh. Yeah, wow. You know, I like history, too...

1021
01:23:19,270 --> 01:23:22,290
也许这一切结束后 咱们再来研究
and maybe when this is all over, you and I can stop by the souvenir shop together.

1022
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:26,800
不过现在我只想找到导弹
But right now I just... I just... I wanna find some rockets.

1023
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:29,960
别惹火我
Don't tempt me.

1024
01:23:30,110 --> 01:23:33,570
我们正要去停尸间
We are going to the morgue.

1025
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:58,990
- 你可以吗? - 我会尽力而为
- You sure you're ready for this? - I'll do my best.

1026
01:23:59,110 --> 01:24:01,670
你会尽力而为?
Your best?

1027
01:24:01,710 --> 01:24:05,070
输家总是抱怨他们已经尽力了
Losers always whine about their best.

1028
01:24:05,210 --> 01:24:09,080
赢家才能搞上选美皇后
Winners go home and fuck the prom queen.

1029
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,510
卡拉是选美皇后
Carla was the prom queen.

1030
01:24:12,690 --> 01:24:16,210
- 真的吗? - 真的
- Really? - Yeah.

1031
01:24:17,960 --> 01:24:20,720
雷达显示他们接近停尸间
Locaters have them approaching the morgue, sir.

1032
01:24:20,890 --> 01:24:23,380
加油 你办得到的
Come on, come on. You can do it, Doc.

1033
01:24:27,470 --> 01:24:31,130
见鬼
Shit!

1034
01:24:31,300 --> 01:24:33,790
千万别迟疑
You must never hesitate. You must never hesitate. You must never hesitate.

1035
01:24:56,900 --> 01:24:59,630
你差点射到导弹
I think you're shooting too close to the rocket.

1036
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:02,060
别射到导弹
Him, but not the rocket.

1037
01:25:02,230 --> 01:25:04,860
还有什么吩咐吗? 教授
Any other news, Professor?

1038
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:09,900
别射到导弹! 别射到导弹!
Not the rocket! Not the rocket.

1039
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:27,010
我要让你们好看
Not the rocket! Not the rocket. I got a little something for ya.

1040
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:54,080
这是我见过死的最惨的人
Oh, yeah, okay. That's just about the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1041
01:25:55,960 --> 01:26:02,120
梅森 一不小心 你就会送命
Mason...the second you don't respect this, it kills you.

1042
01:26:02,290 --> 01:26:04,130
放过去
Put it over there.

1043
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:18,110
你看过尸体 那样算是正常的吗?
You've been around a lot of corpses. Is that normal?

1044
01:26:18,280 --> 01:26:21,440
- 脚在抖? - 对 就是脚在抖
- What, the feet thing? - Yeah, the feet thing.

1045
01:26:21,610 --> 01:26:26,050
- 那很正常 - 那让我不能专心 你可以想点办法吗?
- Yeah, that happens. - Can you do something about it?

1046
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:28,810
要怎样? 再杀死他一次吗?
Well, like what? Kill him again?

1047
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:31,320
听着 我只是个生化专家
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1048
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:35,720
成天关在实验室 生活平淡
And most of the time I work in a glass jar and lead a very uneventful life.

1049
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:38,320
开着棕色的富豪车
I drive a Volvo, a beige one. But what I'm dealing with here...

1050
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:43,290
不过我现在要处理的是这世上最致命的物质
is one of the most deadly substances the Earth has ever known.

1051
01:26:43,330 --> 01:26:45,830
所以拜托你别惹我
So what do you say you cut me some frigging slack?

1052
01:27:02,190 --> 01:27:04,090
一串串相当晶莹剔透
A really elegant string-of-pearls configuration.

1053
01:27:04,260 --> 01:27:06,950
但是很不幸的是 它们非常不稳定
Unfortunately, incredibly unstable.

1054
01:27:07,130 --> 01:27:09,150
这东西能有什么作用?
Well, what exactly does this stuff do?

1055
01:27:09,330 --> 01:27:13,320
如果导弹将之汽化 能够杀死一个城市的居民
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can take out the entire city of people.

1056
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:17,800
真的吗? 如果你掉下一个呢?
Really? And what happens if you drop one?

1057
01:27:17,970 --> 01:27:20,870
幸运的话 只杀死我们俩
Happily, it'll just wipe out you and me.

1058
01:27:21,040 --> 01:27:22,260
- 怎么杀法? - 它在三十秒之内
- How? - It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1059
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:27,670
会切断大脑至脊椎的神经信息
It stops the brain from sending nerve messages down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1060
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:30,840
如果你暴露在它之下 你就会懂了
Any epidermal exposure or inhalation, and you'll know.

1061
01:27:31,020 --> 01:27:35,650
毒药侵袭神经系统 导致后背部剧痛
A twinge at the small of your back as the poison seizes your nervous system.

1062
01:27:35,820 --> 01:27:37,380
别动它
Do not move that!

1063
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,950
你的肌肉收缩呼吸困难
Your muscles freeze, you can't breathe.

1064
01:27:43,160 --> 01:27:46,100
强烈的痉挛 能让你翻搅出五腑内脏
You spasm so hard you break your own back, spit your guts out.

1065
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:51,700
- 不过皮肤会先融化 - 我的天啊
- But that's after your skin melts off. - My God.

1066
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:55,170
我想我们希望现在老天是站在我们这边的 对吧
Oh, I think we'd like God on our side at the moment, don't you?

1067
01:27:55,310 --> 01:28:00,360
我现在要把导航晶片拆掉
So what I'm doing now is removing the guidance system chips...

1068
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,040
导弹在五百尺后会落海
so the rocket will splash down after 500 feet.

1069
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:06,180
给我 你可以放手
All right, let me have that. You can let go of it.

1070
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:08,950
退后退后
All right, just back away. Just back away!

1071
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:12,720
长官 停尸间小队没有回音
Sir, morgue team has not checked in.

1072
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:16,990
黑鸟一号 这是黑鸟 请回答
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. Over.

1073
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:21,930
黑鸟一号 这是黑鸟 请回答 该死的
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird. Come in, goddamn it!

1074
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:27,660
还有敌人 快去
Somebody's still there. Let's move!

1075
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,100
还有鼠辈 封锁停尸间 封锁停尸间
Rats alive! Close on the morgue. Close on the morgue.

1076
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,180
快 快 快
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

1077
01:28:32,340 --> 01:28:35,680
动作快点 我们还有敌人
Frye, Darrow, hustle up. We got more company!

1078
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:43,980
到停尸间会合 快去
Hold it. Converge on the morgue. Move out.

1079
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:47,420
古斯比 快过来
Goodspeed, come on. Come over here.

1080
01:28:47,590 --> 01:28:51,030
我最爱压力了 那是我每天的家常便饭
Good. I love pressure. I eat it for breakfast.

1081
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,720
快点 来不及了
Come on. Time's up.

1082
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:56,030
还有三枚导弹在别的地方 我们一定要找到它们
There's three rockets somewhere else. We have to find them.

1083
01:28:58,570 --> 01:28:59,300
快点
Come on!

1084
01:29:18,460 --> 01:29:19,890
安全
Clear!

1085
01:29:23,030 --> 01:29:26,360
- 我玩这个太老了 - 这会到哪儿?
- I'm too old for this. - Where's it go?

1086
01:29:26,570 --> 01:29:28,620
我不晓得
I've no idea.

1087
01:29:28,830 --> 01:29:31,330
长官 所有的导航晶片都不见了
Sir, all the guidance chips are gone.

1088
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:34,470
你没除掉鼠辈
Captain, I guess you didn't quite take care of the rat problem.

1089
01:29:34,640 --> 01:29:35,130
是的 长官
No, sir.

1090
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:39,010
这里死了两个人 建议你最好把他们解决掉
Well, there are two dead men here who strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1091
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:41,670
是的 长官!
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

1092
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:53,010
- 你不晓得通往哪儿? - 没错 我不知道
- You really don't know where this goes? - No, I don't know where it goes.

1093
01:29:53,050 --> 01:29:56,990
我们速度越来越快了 你知道怎么让它慢下来吗
Well, it's starting to pick up speed. Do you know how to slow it down?

1094
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,600
不 我不知道
No, I don't.

1095
01:30:25,220 --> 01:30:26,780
天哪
God.

1096
01:30:34,170 --> 01:30:38,470
梅森 你还好吧?
Mason, you all right?

1097
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:41,960
好得很 你这个大白痴
Yes, perfectly okay, you fucking idiot!

1098
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,970
他们追来了
They're coming.

1099
01:30:46,140 --> 01:30:48,640
- 谁? - 海军陆战队
- Who? - The marines!

1100
01:30:48,810 --> 01:30:49,870
哪里?
Where?

1101
01:31:51,980 --> 01:31:55,170
- 怎么回事? - 把他拦住
- What the fuck's going on? - Let's cut him off.

1102
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:19,860
梅森
Mason!

1103
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,710
梅森
Mason!

1104
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:46,450
你这浑蛋! 去死吧! 死吧! 死吧!
You motherfucker! Die! Die! Die!

1105
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:10,280
我很高兴你没有考虑太久
I'm rather glad you didn't hesitate too long.

1106
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:17,320
你怎么能保持冷静?
How do you do it?

1107
01:34:17,490 --> 01:34:23,090
我受过世界顶尖的英国情报局严格训练
Oh, I was trained by the best. British lntelligence.

1108
01:34:23,260 --> 01:34:26,030
来吧
Come on.

1109
01:34:26,230 --> 01:34:31,170
老实说 我情愿当诗人或农夫
But in retrospect, I'd rather have been a poet or a farmer.

1110
01:34:31,370 --> 01:34:34,000
好吧
Okay.

1111
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:36,630
时限:8小时

1112
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:40,770
总统三小时后到
Okay, the president arrives in three hours.

1113
01:34:40,950 --> 01:34:45,080
能拖多久就拖 然后进行空袭
His directive is to string Hummel along until the air strike is operational.

1114
01:34:45,250 --> 01:34:47,280
铝热剂进展如何?
What's the word from Mohave, General?

1115
01:34:47,450 --> 01:34:52,360
还是一样 他们正在赶工
The same as last time, Lou. They're going as fast as they can.

1116
01:34:56,530 --> 01:35:00,830
跪下来
Do it over here. On your knees. On your knees!

1117
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:14,070
特遣队员 你手上有我的东西
Navy SEALs, listen up. You've got something that belongs to me.

1118
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,610
正确的说是十二片导航晶片
Twelve guidance chips, to be precise.

1119
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:21,340
让我提醒你们 我手上有危在旦夕的人质
Let me remind you there are lives at stake, civilian lives.

1120
01:35:21,520 --> 01:35:23,180
说话
Speak up.

1121
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:26,220
- 说话! - 我…嗯…
- Speak up! - I, uh, uh...

1122
01:35:26,390 --> 01:35:28,220
告诉他们你的名字
Tell them your name.

1123
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,490
我叫赖瑞・韩德逊
My name is Larry Henderson.

1124
01:35:30,660 --> 01:35:32,250
糟糕
Oh, man.

1125
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,230
我有三个孩子
And I'm a father of three.

1126
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:38,130
他拿枪指着我的脑袋
they've got a gun to my head.

1127
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:42,030
你们有三分钟可以交出导航晶片
You've got exactly three minutes to return the guidance chips

1128
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,800
否则韩德逊先生就没命了
or Mr. Henderson won't have a head.

1129
01:35:44,980 --> 01:35:47,670
噢…不
Oh, no. Hey. What... ?

1130
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:53,650
还有三枚导弹 你去找 并且拆除它们
Now, three to go. You find them and defuse them,

1131
01:35:53,820 --> 01:35:56,680
- 好吗? - 好的
- okay? All right. - All right.

1132
01:35:56,710 --> 01:36:01,120
我去找汉默 试着帮你拖延一些时间
I'll try and delay Hummel and give you more time.

1133
01:36:01,290 --> 01:36:04,390
那韩德逊的脑袋呢?
Hey, what about Mr. Henderson's head?

1134
01:36:06,670 --> 01:36:09,570
没问题? 什么意思?
Okay? What do you mean?

1135
01:36:14,540 --> 01:36:15,970
好吧
Okay.

1136
01:36:29,220 --> 01:36:32,620
- 将军 - 你是什么人
- General. - Who the hell are you?

1137
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:36,890
我就是剩下来的敌人
I'm all that's left of the enemy.

1138
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,570
找到了
Bingo.

1139
01:37:01,490 --> 01:37:03,320
把手放下
Stand easy.

1140
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:10,420
我还以为自己是老兵
Thought I'd been in the service a long time.

1141
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:14,730
- 姓名和军阶 水手? - 事实上 我是陆军
- Name and rank, sailor. - Well, it's army, actually.

1142
01:37:14,930 --> 01:37:19,100
回答问题 并且尊称他为"将军"
Answer the question. And address him as "General, sir."

1143
01:37:20,370 --> 01:37:23,500
约翰・梅森上尉 将军 隶属于皇家特种部队
Captain John Patrick Mason, General, sir...

1144
01:37:23,640 --> 01:37:25,670
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.

1145
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:27,470
当然 已经退伍了
Retired, of course.

1146
01:37:31,450 --> 01:37:34,110
你离家稍微远了点 上尉
You're a long way from home, Captain.

1147
01:37:34,290 --> 01:37:36,880
你是怎么与此事牵扯上的?
How the hell are you involved in this?

1148
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:39,620
我对这座监狱相当熟悉
Oh, I have a unique knowledge of this prison facility.

1149
01:37:39,790 --> 01:37:42,690
我以前曾在这里作过客
I was, uh, formerly a guest here.

1150
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,200
嗨 小家伙
Hi, sweetie.

1151
01:38:06,020 --> 01:38:08,510
给我回来 小男孩
Hey, come back here, little boy.

1152
01:38:10,420 --> 01:38:13,260
他们有告诉你我的目的
Did they bother to tell you who I am, why I'm doing this?

1153
01:38:13,430 --> 01:38:16,360
还是只是利用你而已?
Or are they just using you like they do everybody else?

1154
01:38:16,530 --> 01:38:20,230
我只知道电视上说你是个越战英雄
All I know is you were big in Vietnam. I saw the highlights on television.

1155
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:24,030
那你根本就不知道
You wouldn't have any fucking idea what it means to lead some of the finest men on God's earth into battle,

1156
01:38:24,240 --> 01:38:26,430
看到优秀军人被他们的政府出卖的痛苦
and then see their memory betrayed by their own fucking government.

1157
01:38:26,600 --> 01:38:31,440
我看不出屠杀一百万人如何能安慰他们的英灵?
I don't quite see how you cherish the memory of the dead by killing another million.

1158
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:35,340
而且…这不是战争
And, uh, this is not combat.

1159
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:39,710
这是疯狂行径 将军
It's an act of lunacy, General, sir.

1160
01:38:39,880 --> 01:38:42,510
我认为是个大白痴
Personally, I think you're a fucking idiot.

1161
01:38:48,860 --> 01:38:51,390
"自由之树必须以爱国者
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time...

1162
01:38:51,600 --> 01:38:54,790
和暴君的血灌溉开花" 汤玛士・杰佛逊说的
with the blood of patriots and tyrants." Thomas Jefferson.

1163
01:38:55,000 --> 01:38:59,730
王尔德说过"爱国主义是邪恶的美德"
"Patriotism is the virtue of the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1164
01:39:04,780 --> 01:39:06,710
谢谢你证明我的观点
Thank you for making my point.

1165
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:11,140
导航晶片呢? 导航晶片在哪?
Where are the guidance chips? Where are the guidance chips?

1166
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,480
我毁掉了
I destroyed them.

1167
01:39:13,650 --> 01:39:15,450
你不该这么做的
That was a bad move, soldier.

1168
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:18,490
那你要处决我们吗?
Does that mean you'll execute us both?

1169
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:49,940
算你走运 汉默要抓活的
You're lucky that old man Hummel wants you alive.

1170
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,250
我倒很乐意把你开膛剖肚
'Cause I'll take pleasure in gutting you, boy.

1171
01:39:54,500 --> 01:39:58,750
时限:52分钟

1172
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:04,060
我倒很乐意把你开膛剖肚
I'd take pleasure in gutting you...boy!

1173
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:09,710
我很乐意把你开膛剖肚
"l'll take pleasure in gutting you, boy."

1174
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,640
这些人是怎么了? 梅森
What is wrong with these people, huh, Mason?

1175
01:40:11,810 --> 01:40:15,840
这岛上到处都充满了愤怒
Don't you think there's a lot of,uh,a lot of anger floating around this island?

1176
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:19,180
一大堆莽撞青少年
Kind of a pubescent volatility? Don't you think?

1177
01:40:19,350 --> 01:40:23,480
你不认为他们满怀苦恼 心中都充满了杀父情结
A lot of angst, a lot of, "I'm 16, I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1178
01:40:23,660 --> 01:40:25,920
成熟点吧! 我们跟一群噬
I mean, grow up! We're stuck on an island...

1179
01:40:26,090 --> 01:40:28,960
血如命的变态军人混在一起
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure seeking psychopathic marines.

1180
01:40:29,130 --> 01:40:31,720
他们真丢脸
Shame on them!

1181
01:40:34,200 --> 01:40:37,360
我只拆除了一枚导弹 还剩两枚没拆
Anyway, I only got one chem round. There's two left.

1182
01:40:37,540 --> 01:40:39,030
梅森?
Mason?

1183
01:40:39,200 --> 01:40:41,500
我在这儿
Yes, I'm here.

1184
01:40:41,640 --> 01:40:44,230
我真怀念
I was just thinking how wonderful it was...

1185
01:40:44,410 --> 01:40:46,840
当时不准说话的日子
when the inmates weren't allowed to talk in here.

1186
01:40:47,010 --> 01:40:49,640
不准说话?
Not allowed to talk.

1187
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:51,840
你怎么受的了?
How did you do it?

1188
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:56,680
我在心里满怀希望
Uh, nurtured the hope that there was hope.

1189
01:40:56,860 --> 01:41:00,290
希望有一天能重获自由
That one day I'd breathe free air.

1190
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:03,720
也许还能见到我的女儿
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1191
01:41:03,900 --> 01:41:08,330
希望很卑微 却能让人保持求生意志
Modest hopes, but, uh, they kept a man alive.

1192
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:11,490
你为什么会被关起来?
What'd they put you away for, John?

1193
01:41:11,700 --> 01:41:14,300
说来话长
Oh, that's a long story.

1194
01:41:14,470 --> 01:41:16,960
反正我哪里也去不成
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1195
01:41:17,110 --> 01:41:20,670
我们的人有多久没有回音了?
When was the last communication from our men on Alcatraz?

1196
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:23,010
七个小时
Seven hours.

1197
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:28,780
- 铝热剂完成了 - 帮我接总统
- Thermite plasma is operational. - Get me the president.

1198
01:41:28,950 --> 01:41:33,480
请坐 请各位保持随时待命
Be seated.Gentlemen, consider yourselveson ground alert.

1199
01:41:33,660 --> 01:41:36,060
一旦出发 你们的任务就是
If we receive launch authority. your mission is...

1200
01:41:36,230 --> 01:41:38,460
彻底摧毁恶魔岛
the complete thermal destruction of Alcatraz lsland.

1201
01:41:38,660 --> 01:41:42,720
每一寸地都必须完全摧毁 不能有任何漏失
The entire island is to be blanketed, not one square inch missed.

1202
01:41:42,930 --> 01:41:48,100
81名平民以及部份军人将会在这次攻击中牺牲
Eighty-one American civilians and a number of U.S. Marines will lose their lives in this air strike.

1203
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:55,140
你何不交出胶片以解决问题呢?
Why didn't you just tell them where the microfilm was and create a solution?

1204
01:41:55,310 --> 01:42:00,220
一旦胶片拿到手 他们就会让我死
Hmph. The moment they had the microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1205
01:42:00,390 --> 01:42:03,670
- 这是他们的解决办法 - 结果你被关在这儿
- Some solution. - And you ended up here.

1206
01:42:03,710 --> 01:42:07,020
这让我想到另一个问题
Which brings me to another question.

1207
01:42:07,190 --> 01:42:10,560
当年你逃狱的时候…我干脆直讲吧
When you broke out... Let me see if I can get this straight.

1208
01:42:10,760 --> 01:42:14,660
你当年下到焚化炉的滑运道 坐上矿坑小车
You went down the incinerator chute.on the mine cars,

1209
01:42:14,870 --> 01:42:17,800
穿过隧道到达发电厂
through the tunnels to the power plant.

1210
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:21,340
然后再穿过蒸气引擎 那招真的很帅
under the steam engine... That was really cool, by the way...

1211
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:24,600
进入贮水池 然后从水管逃出去
and into the cistern through the intake pipe.

1212
01:42:24,780 --> 01:42:29,410
不过你到底
But how, in the name of Zeus's butthole...

1213
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,520
是怎么逃出囚房的?
did you get out of your cell?

1214
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:35,140
我之所以问的原因 是因为就我们目前的处境
I only ask because in our current situation...

1215
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:41,090
这招应该会…很有用!
well, it could prove to be useful information, maybe!

1216
01:42:58,880 --> 01:43:01,670
专业秘密 孩子
Trade secrets, my son.

1217
01:43:05,080 --> 01:43:07,450
将军 我们只剩两枚可用的导弹
General, two operational rockets left.

1218
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:09,920
一枚在灯塔 一枚在屋顶
One's at the lower lighthouse and there is one on the roof.

1219
01:43:10,090 --> 01:43:14,080
两枚都随时待命了 长官 将军 你听到吗?
And both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.General, can you hear me?

1220
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:17,250
- 我听到了 上尉 - 我只想确定一下
- I heard you, Captain. - Oh, just making sure.

1221
01:43:19,000 --> 01:43:21,900
我们是否该准备发射了? 将军
Should we prepare for launch, General?

1222
01:43:23,270 --> 01:43:27,230
- 我来决定战略 上尉 - 我懂了
- I'll handle the strategy, Captain. - Yes, sir.

1223
01:43:27,440 --> 01:43:32,470
时间快到了 我只想让你知道这点长官
The hour is approaching, sir.Just letting the General know of the time, sir.

1224
01:43:32,610 --> 01:43:34,480
这点我很清楚 上尉
I'm very aware of the time, Captain.

1225
01:43:34,650 --> 01:43:36,880
是的 长官只是要让你知道
Aye, aye, sir. Letting you know.

1226
01:43:37,050 --> 01:43:39,640
我和我的弟兄都准备好了准备好好大干一场
Me and my boys are ready to cock, lock, and ready to rock.

1227
01:43:42,020 --> 01:43:44,080
梅森 你要上哪儿去?
Mason, where're you going?

1228
01:43:44,260 --> 01:43:47,090
三十年前 我就发誓我决不能死在这里
Thirty years ago I vowed I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1229
01:43:47,260 --> 01:43:51,520
你不能走 那里有个狂人的手里正操纵着导弹的发射按钮
You're not leaving! There's a madman in there with his hand on a, on a button!

1230
01:43:51,730 --> 01:43:55,390
他会被狙击手一枪打死的
Shh. Some sniper's gonna get his ass.

1231
01:43:55,600 --> 01:43:58,230
站住 梅森
Stop moving, Mason.

1232
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:02,230
梅森 别动
Mason, stop moving.

1233
01:44:02,370 --> 01:44:05,540
汉默不会下手的 他是个军人不是个谋杀犯
Hummel won't do it. He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1234
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:07,870
我从他的眼神看得出来
I read it in his eyes.

1235
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:11,640
你从他的眼神看得出来? 那敢情好!
You read his eyes? Oh, well, then everything's just fine!

1236
01:44:11,820 --> 01:44:14,940
- 但我不能冒这个险 - 拜托你再大声点
- I can't afford to take that chance. - Why don't you talk louder?

1237
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,610
还剩三分钟
Three minutes to go, sir.

1238
01:44:19,460 --> 01:44:22,290
- 他们不会打电话来了 - 会打来的
- They're not gonna call, Frank. - Oh, they'll call.

1239
01:44:22,460 --> 01:44:25,730
如果我们发射一枚导弹他们就会打电话来的
They'll call if we fire one of our rockets up their ass.

1240
01:44:25,930 --> 01:44:28,830
长官
Sir.

1241
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:36,330
- 我是汉默 - 法兰克 我是克拉玛
- Hummel. - Hi, Frank. It's AI Kramer here.

1242
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:39,240
- 怎么样? - 你认为呢?
- How's it going out there? - How do you think it's going?

1243
01:44:39,410 --> 01:44:43,010
- 听着 我们还需要一小时 - 你们只剩三分钟
- Listen, on this end we're gonna need another hour, Frank. - You've got three minutes.

1244
01:44:43,180 --> 01:44:47,240
- 法兰克我们得等总统… - 你们只有三分钟
- Listen, uh, Frank, we have to get final authorization from the president. - You've got three minutes.

1245
01:44:47,420 --> 01:44:50,820
法兰克 请你别做出傻事
Frank, please don't do anything stupid.

1246
01:44:50,990 --> 01:44:54,650
他们还需要一个小时
They want another hour.

1247
01:44:54,830 --> 01:44:58,090
鬼扯 他们在骗人 将军
Well, that's bullshit. That's bullshit, General. They're lying !

1248
01:44:58,300 --> 01:45:02,290
他们在耍你 把你当白痴长官
They're calling our bluff, sir. They're playing you for a fool, sir.

1249
01:45:02,500 --> 01:45:07,530
下令发射导弹 将军
Order the launch, General.

1250
01:45:07,710 --> 01:45:11,200
快点 将军 我们下定决心吧!
Come on, General. Let's be all we can be.

1251
01:45:25,660 --> 01:45:27,720
任务还没完成
The mission's not complete!

1252
01:45:27,890 --> 01:45:29,760
我的任务完成了
Well, mine is.

1253
01:45:29,930 --> 01:45:32,560
这个任务结束之后你会回家
When this is over, you'll go back home...

1254
01:45:32,760 --> 01:45:37,430
开着你的棕色富豪轿车 载着卡拉和小宝宝兜风
driving Carla and your baby insane in your beige Volvo.

1255
01:45:37,600 --> 01:45:41,090
我不是死了就是回到监狱 那都没什么两样
And I'll be dead or back in prison, which is the same thing.

1256
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:45,570
你不能走
You're not leaving.

1257
01:45:48,050 --> 01:45:51,980
好吧 我自己来
All right, I'll do it myself.

1258
01:45:53,220 --> 01:45:55,310
我受过三星期武器训练
I got three weeks' weapons training.

1259
01:45:55,490 --> 01:45:59,750
我能消灭整排士兵
I'll kick the... Out of a platoon full of marines.

1260
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:02,620
小意思
No problem.

1261
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:16,940
- 少校 连接上屋顶的导弹 - 是
- Major, patch me into Roof Battery. - Aye, sir.

1262
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:20,910
打开控制电路 准备接收目标方位
Fire open control circuit coordinates to the roof, sir.

1263
01:46:21,080 --> 01:46:23,410
快点
Let's go!

1264
01:46:28,820 --> 01:46:29,810
启动电源
Laser powered up!

1265
01:46:30,050 --> 01:46:32,550
噢…不好
Oh, no.

1266
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:35,490
我说 给我跪下
I said, on your knees!

1267
01:46:35,660 --> 01:46:38,090
我的名字叫史丹利・古斯比
My name's Stanley Goodspeed.

1268
01:46:38,300 --> 01:46:41,160
我是FBI的化学武器专家
I'm a chemical weapons specialist for the FBl.

1269
01:46:41,330 --> 01:46:43,200
- 玻璃瓮还是塑胶袋? - 什么?
- Uh, glass or plastic? - What?

1270
01:46:43,370 --> 01:46:45,800
- 玻璃瓮还是塑胶袋? - 闭嘴
- Glass or plastic? Glass or plastic? - Shut the fuck up!

1271
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,400
因为如果导弹发射之后 风向改变的话我们都会死
Because if the winds change after you launch those rockets... we're all gonna die.

1272
01:46:49,570 --> 01:46:50,730
闭嘴
Shut up!

1273
01:46:50,910 --> 01:46:54,670
你的尸体不是用玻璃瓮就是用塑胶尸袋装
And you're gonna end up in either a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1274
01:46:54,850 --> 01:46:59,870
你自己想想看 把枪交给我 我们去找导弹吧
So, what do you say you do the math, hand over the gun and let's go find some rockets?

1275
01:47:00,050 --> 01:47:03,280
我叫你闭嘴…
I said shut the fuck...

1276

Hey, the last time I swam this channel I was your age.

1279
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:22,410

Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing is this for real?

1282
01:47:29,110 --> 01:47:31,670

1304
01:49:50,550 --> 01:49:52,550

01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:55,990
- 没射中 - 太好了

1307
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:03,430
导弹是怎么回事? 座标怎么会变?
What happened to the rocket? What the fuck happened?

1308

- 你在做什么? - 我还不想伤害无辜百姓
- What the hell are you doing? - I'm not ready to kill these people.

1316
01:50:53,950 --> 01:50:55,920
- 打电话给五角大厦 再向他们争取时间 - 不
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time. - No!

1317
01:50:56,090 --> 01:50:59,080
快点 法兰克 我们就快失控了
Do it, Frank! We're coming loose.

1318
01:50:59,260 --> 01:51:02,280
你才失控了 其他人还是很冷静的
You're coming loose. The rest of us are in complete control.

1319
01:51:02,460 --> 01:51:05,330
- 我们要新的时限 - 放下电话
- We're asking 'em. We're asking 'em for a new deadline. - Put the phone down.

1320
01:51:05,530 --> 01:51:07,960
- 兄弟们开始失控了 - 他们是陆战队员
- The men are falling apart. - The men are marines!

1321
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:12,070
是吗? 我找克拉玛将军
Are they? I wanna talk to General Kramer.

1322
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:14,900
- 我以老朋友的身份劝你 - 现在就打电话给他

1324
01:51:17,270 --> 01:51:20,510
我给你最后一次机会
Now you're being given your last chance by a man with a gun.

1325
01:51:20,680 --> 01:51:22,770
把电话放下
Put the phone down.

1326
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:29,680
- 我以为你还没准备杀人 - 我在开始准备了
- I thought you weren't ready to kill. - I'm warming up.

1327
01:51:29,850 --> 01:51:31,910
稍息
At ease.

1328
01:51:40,660 --> 01:51:43,660
你得做出决定 总统先生
They need a decision, Mr. President.

1329
01:51:49,710 --> 01:51:53,540
过去这几个小时
These past few hours...

1330
01:51:53,710 --> 01:51:57,910
是我生命中最漫长最黑暗的时刻
have been the longest, darkest of my life.

1331
01:51:58,080 --> 01:52:01,610
人命该如何评估呢?
How does one weigh human life?

1332
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:06,420
一百万市民和81名人质

1333
01:52:06,590 --> 01:52:09,860
还有法兰克汉默
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1334
01:52:10,030 --> 01:52:14,190
我们忽视并遗弃
That we have ignored,abandoned...

1335
01:52:14,400 --> 01:52:18,700
像汉默这样伟大的英雄
or marginalized a great soldier like Frank Hummel...

1336
01:52:18,870 --> 01:52:21,960
还有那些被忽视 且为国捐驱的军人子弟
and that American boys have paid for that neglect...

1337
01:52:22,110 --> 01:52:25,440
同样地真实
in blood is equally real...

1338
01:52:25,610 --> 01:52:27,940
也同样地悲哀
and equally tragic.

1339
01:52:30,510 --> 01:52:32,610
我们向恐怖行动宣战
We are at war with terror.

1340
01:52:32,780 --> 01:52:36,280
战争必有伤亡
Fighting a war means casualties.

1341
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:39,850
这是我所做过最困难的决定
This is the worst call I've ever had to make.

1342
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:47,430
批准空袭行动

1343
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:51,770
红雷 待命准备起飞

1344
01:52:51,940 --> 01:52:55,200
投下这么多的弹药
With the amount of firepower they're gonna drop in there...

1345
01:52:55,340 --> 01:52:58,400
- 塔台 准备起飞… - 几秒就会完全毁灭
- Tower this is Strike Leader. Prepared to go. - it'll be over in a few seconds.

1346
01:52:58,580 --> 01:53:01,240
十七分钟后抵达目标
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1347
01:53:07,950 --> 01:53:11,220
对不起 将军 恕我无理
Excuse me, General, sir, with all due respect to you,

1348
01:53:11,390 --> 01:53:14,120
- 你倒底在搞什么鬼? - 你更改了座标 是不是 将军?
- what the fuck is going on? - You changed the coordinates, didn't you, General?

1349
01:53:14,290 --> 01:53:17,450
- 没错 上尉 - 现在他们以为我们没种
- That's affirmative, Captain. - So, now they think we're gutless?

1350
01:53:17,630 --> 01:53:20,220
因为我们什么都没做到
The Feds? They think we won't actually do it.

1351
01:53:20,430 --> 01:53:23,130
他们会海上与空中全力进攻
They're gonna come at us with everything they've got. Air and sea.

1352
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:25,430
把我们炸的粉身碎骨
They're gonna bomb our ass back to the Stone Age.

1353
01:53:25,470 --> 01:53:27,700
他们不晓得我们是故意错开目标的
They don't know we missed on purpose.

1354
01:53:27,870 --> 01:53:33,110
太好了 我们不是没种 而是无能 对吧?
Great. We're not gutless, we're incompetent. That right?

1355
01:53:33,240 --> 01:53:36,580
我不喜欢你的口气 上尉 带导弹
I don't think I like your tone, Captain. We planned for this contingency.

1356
01:53:36,750 --> 01:53:39,680
和四名人质一起撤退
Load the V.X. into the choppers, take four hostages and evacuate.

1357
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:42,010
我会留下来承担一切后果
The consequences of our actions I'll face alone.

1358
01:53:42,190 --> 01:53:45,310
对不起 将军 他妈的钱呢?
Excuse me, General, but what about the fucking money?

1359
01:53:45,490 --> 01:53:47,890
没有钱 任务结束
There is no fucking money. Mission's over.

1360
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,750
才怪呢
Bullshit it's over.

1361
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:53,390
你在跟一位将军讲话 维持军纪
You're talking to a General, soldier. Maintain discipline.

1362
01:53:53,600 --> 01:53:58,160
我不是军人 少校 在我们挟持人质之后 我们就成了佣兵
I'm not a soldier, Major.The day we took hostages we became mercenaries.

1363
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:03,100
而佣兵要的是钱 我要我的钱
And mercenaries get paid I want my fucking money!

1364
01:54:03,240 --> 01:54:05,730
这项任务全靠武力威胁
This mission was based on the threat of force.

1365
01:54:05,910 --> 01:54:09,510
我不会屠杀无辜百姓
I'm not about to kill 80,000 innocent people.

1366
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:12,950
你们以为我疯了吗?
Do you think I'm out of my fucking mind?

1367
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:16,090
我们虚张声势 他们发现了 任务结束
We bluffed. They called it. The mission's over.

1368
01:54:19,620 --> 01:54:22,220
谁说我们是虚张声势的 将军
Whoever said anything about bluffing, General?

1369
01:54:22,390 --> 01:54:25,120
退下 上尉
Stand down, Captain.

1370

少校 我要你带着这些人上直升机准备撤退
Major, I'm ordering you to take these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1372
01:54:42,480 --> 01:54:45,810
我的命令很简单 少校
That's a simple order, Major!

1373
01:54:45,980 --> 01:54:48,040
一点都不简单 法兰克
It's not so simple, Frank.

1374
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:52,850
柯中士 逮捕将军
Sergeant Crisp secure the General.

1375
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:55,920
我解除你的指挥权 长官

1376
01:54:59,800 --> 01:55:02,460
中士!
Sergeant!

1377
01:55:09,070 --> 01:55:12,100
- 请把手枪给我 长官 - 你是说这把吗?
- I'll have that sidearm, sir. - You mean this sidearm?

1378
01:55:21,120 --> 01:55:24,490
少校 你站在哪一边?
Major Baxter, you're either with us or against us.

1379
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:34,090
我很荣幸能跟你一起服役将军
It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve with you, General.

1380
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:43,500
可是就像他说的 一切都结束了
But like he said...it's over.

1381
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:03,150
我们去救他

1382
01:56:08,330 --> 01:56:10,860
梅森
Mason!

1383
01:56:12,100 --> 01:56:14,830
我的天啊 我做了什么?

1384
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:18,770
还有一枚导弹呢? 最后一枚导弹呢?
Where's the last rocket? Where's the last rocket?
