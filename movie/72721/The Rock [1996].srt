2
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:47,391
We can't hold out much longer, sir.

3
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,568
General Hummel, you've got
to get us out of here now!

4
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,801
I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.

5
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:29,517
Goddamn it, sir!
How long do we have to wait?

6
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:31,498
I've lost 15 men already!

7
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:34,730
Sir, they're lighting us up
like a firestorm!

8
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:38,015
This is Gen. Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!

9
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:40,726
We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.

10
00:01:43,593 --> 00:01:46,565
They're not comin'
for us, are they, sir?

11
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:59,599
Congressman Weaver and esteemed members
of the Special Armed Services Committee,

12
00:01:59,807 --> 00:02:03,092
I come before you
to protest a grave injustice.

13
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:16,126
Aim!

14
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:19,358
It has to stop.

15
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:04,872
I miss you so much.

16
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:17,489
There's somethin'
I've gotta do, Barb.

17
00:03:17,593 --> 00:03:20,826
Somethin' I couldn't do
while you were here.

18
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,172
I tried.

19
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:27,864
You know I tried everything,
and I still don't have their attention.

20
00:03:29,741 --> 00:03:33,547
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

21
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,102
But whatever happens...

22
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,481
please don't think less of me.

23
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:27,246
Marine! Inform the garrison C.O.
that Gen. Hummel's coming on board...

24
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,801
- with a security inspection team.
- Yes, sir.

25
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:32,721
Sir, it's an honor having you, sir.

26
00:04:47,475 --> 00:04:49,613
Aah!

27
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:01,864
- Uuh!
- Oof!

28
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:04,263
Ya know, at least we can get some--

29
00:05:07,547 --> 00:05:12,604
- Yeah, I'll tell ya-- Uuh!
- Ooh!

30
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:16,514
- Aah! Aah!

31
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:18,131
Uuh!

32
00:05:22,875 --> 00:05:27,359
I got the access card. We got
30 minutes 'til those darts wear off.

33
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,871
Move it!

34
00:05:32,676 --> 00:05:34,605
The access card, sir.

35
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,881
Let's do it.

36
00:05:43,729 --> 00:05:46,597
Twenty-four hundred
magazine check.

37
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,844
- Man, it's wet out there.
- Check me through, will ya?

38
00:06:14,593 --> 00:06:17,200
Clear!

39
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:45,979
- I want 16, Major.
- Move it!

40
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:16,322
- Evac! Seal the door!
- No! No!

41
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:18,720
Come on, man, seal it! Seal it!

42
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:21,379
No-o-o!

43
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,123
Lemme outta here! Oh, God!
Lemme outta here! Oh, God!

44
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,313
Lemme outta here! God!

45
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,432
Clear out.
Get outta here!

46
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:40,304
- Please!
- Sorry.

47
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:49,480
Let's move out.

48
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:03,609
Two more CCs of acetylene chloride.

49
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:08,979
That'll be five dollars,
Isherwood.

50
00:08:09,135 --> 00:08:11,846
You suck.

51
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,970
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

52
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:25,453
Yes! She's here.
Bring it to me now. Thank you, Phil.

53
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:28,060
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

54
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:33,065
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

55
00:08:33,117 --> 00:08:37,132
Carla's right. Why don't you just
spend $13.00 on a CD, man?

56
00:08:37,236 --> 00:08:39,738
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

57
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:42,189
And second, these sound better.

58
00:08:42,293 --> 00:08:44,848
- Could be serious.

59
00:08:45,004 --> 00:08:47,350
Could be sarin gas.

60
00:08:49,801 --> 00:08:52,616
Dog out at J.F.K. caught a whiff
of something in this package...

61
00:08:52,668 --> 00:08:54,597
postmarked
to a Bosnian refugee camp.

62
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,569
It could be detergent;
it could be sarin gas.

63
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,550
Bosnian refugee camp?

64
00:08:59,602 --> 00:09:02,939
Half a million Serbians reside in
the U.S. Serbians don't like Bosnians.

65
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:05,285
You guys wanna get suited up?

66
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:11,906
- Bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

67
00:09:12,115 --> 00:09:14,096
We have airlock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.

68
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:23,011
October 1, 0900 hours.

69
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:26,817
Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent Trainee Marvin Isherwood...

70
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:29,059
initiating exam of wooden crate.

71
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:32,917
Suspicion of sarin gas inside.

72
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,158
- Marvin, sarin is a--
- G.B. aerosol.

73
00:09:35,315 --> 00:09:38,808
That is correct.
I see we have some dirty magazines.

74
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,092
Stone Age Cavegirls In the Raw.
Kinky.

75
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:45,533
And, uh-- Not a good sign.

76
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:49,600
Helloo-oo-oo, little baby doll.
Look it, Stan.

77
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:53,093
- Hi, there, Stanley!
- Marvin, don't!

78
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,866
- Hiya, Stan!

79
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,619
Shit! Move back!
Move back!

80
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:01,278
- Power landings offed.
- Hang on, guys.

81
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,885
We'll have that room cleared
in 50 seconds. You're going to be okay.

82
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,231
Jesus Christ!

83
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:10,037
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

84
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:14,469
The bad news is that the gas is
corrosive and it's eating our suits.

85
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:17,701
- It's all over my hand, man.
- The really bad news...

86
00:10:17,805 --> 00:10:21,507
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

87
00:10:21,611 --> 00:10:23,488
- and kill everybody in the building.
- Detonation too heavy.

88
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:25,886
- Everybody, out of the room, now!
- Seal us inside.

89
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,664
Where are the sprinklers,
Lonner?

90
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,669
The acid's eating my su-- It's eating
my fucking suit, all right? Shit.

91
00:10:37,825 --> 00:10:41,162
Just wash us off.
Where are my sprinklers?

92
00:10:41,318 --> 00:10:43,091
We're working on it.
It's just a flow problem.

93
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:45,854
Well, it's a pretty big friggin'
problem, Lonner. Fix it now!

94
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:48,096
We're working on it! How much time
do you have on that detonator?

95
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:50,129
- A minute, ten.
- Hey, look at this!

96
00:10:50,234 --> 00:10:52,632
We're gonna have the room clear.

97
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:54,717
- Tell 'em to take the atropine, now.
- The atropine, Isherwood.

98
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:57,533
- What?
- Where's my water? One minute!

99
00:10:57,637 --> 00:11:02,173
Marvin, the atropine! Inject it
in your heart before your suit melts.

100
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,571
Shh-it!

101
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:08,116
- Make him take his dose!
- Where's that water?

102
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:13,069
- Get that away from me!
- Come on, Phil, fix it,
for Christ's sake!

103
00:11:13,121 --> 00:11:17,031
- Take the atropine now,
Stan, for Christ's sake!
- We're fucked.

104
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:20,889
- Poison's mixing.
- What the fuck are you waiting for?

105
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:25,060
- You take the fucking needle now!
- Fucking shit, oh fucking shit--

106
00:11:25,112 --> 00:11:27,615
- Forty seconds!
- If that suit melts--

107
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:30,117
If you die, we all die!
Inject your heart...

108
00:11:30,169 --> 00:11:32,620
- and then diffuse the bomb!
- Come on, just do it, Stan!

109
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,122
Shit, what if I miss my heart?
I can't see shit!

110
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,781
- Do it now!
- Look how big this is.

111
00:11:37,885 --> 00:11:41,535
You want me to stick this into
my heart? Are you fucking nuts?

112
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,829
The sprinkler's coming.
It's coming.

113
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:46,175
Okay, here we go, man!

114
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,763
Sprinkler activated!

115
00:11:50,867 --> 00:11:52,744
How much time left?

116
00:11:52,848 --> 00:11:55,924
Twenty seconds.

117
00:11:56,029 --> 00:11:58,218
We're not gonna make it.

118
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,503
- Fifteen.

119
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,299
Oh, come on!

120
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:08,697
Clear!

121
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:13,129
Get me the fuck out
of this gas chamber.

122
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:16,257
I almost stabbed myself
in the heart with this thing!

123
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,385
-# Please lock me away #

124
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:21,888
- Stan?
- Hey, darlin'.

125
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,694
-# And don't allow the day here inside #
-Hi, baby.

126
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:29,030
# Where I hide with my loneliness #

127
00:12:29,135 --> 00:12:31,168
I had such
an interesting day today.

128
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:34,035
- # I don't care what they say #
- Yeah, I had kind of
an interesting day myself.

129
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:37,216
- Okay, you go first.

130
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:41,282
Oh, just some terrorists decide to send
a little care package-- box o' goodies--

131
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:45,974
- which had to be neutralized
before blowing up the office.

132
00:12:46,131 --> 00:12:49,363
So, I took the rest of the day off.
Glass of wine, a little guitar--

133
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:52,595
-Just relaxing.
- Wow.

134
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,349
The world is being
Fed-Ex'd to hell on a handcart.

135
00:12:56,506 --> 00:12:59,947
I believe that anyone who's thinking
about having a child in this world...

136
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:03,127
is coldly considering
an act of cruelty.

137
00:13:03,231 --> 00:13:07,819
I know, I'm rambling, I'm complaining,
I'm sorry. What's your news, baby?

138
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:11,416
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm sorry?

139
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,971
I'm pregnant.

140
00:13:17,203 --> 00:13:19,914
- Really?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:23,668
- Wow.
- Is that all you're gonna say, "wow"?

142
00:13:23,825 --> 00:13:26,327
- You're pregnant?
- Three weeks.

143
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:28,621
How do you know?
I mean, h-how do you know?

144
00:13:28,673 --> 00:13:32,375
Blue.

145
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:35,347
Just turned blue,
so I went to the doctor.

146
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:38,475
- Well, you didn't mean
what you just said, did you?
- When?

147
00:13:38,631 --> 00:13:41,134
Just right now, when you were talking
about bringing a child into the world...

148
00:13:41,186 --> 00:13:44,992
- and having it be an act of... cruelty.
- I meant it at the time.

149
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:47,807
Stanley, at the time? You said
it seven and a half seconds ago.

150
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:53,594
Well... gosh, kind of a lot's happened
since then. We're not even married.

151
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,826
I know. It's funny
you should mention that.

152
00:13:56,931 --> 00:13:59,746
- It's funny?
- Do you love me?

153
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,187
- Of course I love you.
- Good.

154
00:14:06,628 --> 00:14:11,372
- Will you marry me?
- Whoa, whoa, hey--
Marriage Police, pull over.

155
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:14,865
Come on, Stanley.
I'm proposing to you right now.

156
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:28,368
The Rock is the most famous and
was the most feared prison ever built.

157
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:31,288
Is it really true that there's
never been an escape?

158
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:35,354
Ah, that's true. From 1936
until '63 when the prison closed,

159
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,388
there were 14 attempts.

160
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:41,559
No one is believed to have made it
to shore-- alive, at least.

161
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:46,616
Uh, hey, hey, fellas. I'm sorry,
but tourists are not allowed back here.

162
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:48,858
I don't really give a shit.
You give a shit?

163
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:51,360
- No. Come here, fruity.
- Move!

164
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:55,427
- Hey, girls? Hi.
You all havin' a good time?
- Yeah.

165
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:58,555
Will you do something for me?
It's really-- It's really important.

166
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:01,891
I need you to tell your teacher
that you need to get back on the boat
and go home right now.

167
00:15:02,048 --> 00:15:05,489
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Broadway!

168
00:15:05,593 --> 00:15:07,939
This cell block housed...

169
00:15:08,043 --> 00:15:11,537
the most awesome scum
in America.

170
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:15,603
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Ranger Bob,
cordially invite you...

171
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:19,044
to become inmates of Alcatraz--
temporarily, of course, heh!

172
00:15:21,859 --> 00:15:24,101
On line!

173
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:28,689
Pretty tight quarters,
aren't they, huh?

174
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:31,192
Like being a caged animal.

175
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:34,528
Spend a couple of years in there--
What's the matter, fellas?

176
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,187
- Something wrong with the tour?
- Tour's over, Bob.

177
00:15:43,496 --> 00:15:46,728
What kind of
fucked-up tour is this?

178
00:16:00,492 --> 00:16:03,620
Gen. Hummel, Captains Frye
and Darrow reporting, sir.

179
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:07,374
Welcome to the Rock, gentlemen.
Land the choppers on the back side
and deploy as planned.

180
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,824
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Aye, aye, sir. Move out!

181
00:16:09,928 --> 00:16:12,014
I'm not allowed
to carry a gun!

182
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,881
Oh, you're not allowed to carry a gun?
I got a goddamned gun!

183
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:18,635
If I'd had known this was gonna happen,
I'd have brought my motherfuckin' gun!

184
00:16:18,843 --> 00:16:20,877
Help!

185
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:25,100
All right, this'll be our new home.
Tom, I want a command center right here.

186
00:16:33,389 --> 00:16:35,370
- I want coms up.
- Roger that, sir.

187
00:16:35,475 --> 00:16:39,854
Put the satellite over there.
I want to be up at 1600.

188
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:42,044
Let's move it.

189
00:16:49,864 --> 00:16:52,627
- Systems up.

190
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:57,267
Possible penetration point in shower
room. We're setting anti-intrusion.

191
00:16:57,372 --> 00:17:01,386
I brought a personal touch, sir.
It's an antimotion trembler device.

192
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:05,870
It's custom-made. Nobody knows
about it, and nobody expects it.

193
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:09,258
- What's it do?
- We head-fake 'em with the laser beam,

194
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:13,377
and then if they disturb Mr. Backup
here... we own 'em.

195
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:30,634
Ladies and gentlemen, you're
being detained against your will.

196
00:17:30,686 --> 00:17:35,222
For that I apologize. It is not
our intention in anyway to harm you.

197
00:17:35,378 --> 00:17:39,653
You will not be detained
one minute longer than is necessary
for us to complete our mission.

198
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:47,630
Attention on deck!

199
00:17:47,682 --> 00:17:50,915
Stand easy, men.

200
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:56,232
Make no mistake about it, gentlemen.
We are now in harm's way.

201
00:17:56,389 --> 00:17:59,413
For Major Baxter and I, this is the last
campaign in a career dating back...

202
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:01,602
to Tet '68.

203
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,939
Likewise for Captain Hendrix
and Gunnery Sergeant Crisp,

204
00:18:05,095 --> 00:18:08,797
who cut their teeth
under my command in Desert Storm.

205
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:13,124
Capt. Frye, Capt. Darrow, this is
my first operational situation with you,

206
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,366
and I have to say thus far your conduct
reflects your reputations.

207
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,347
- Thank you, General.
- Thank you, sir.

208
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:20,788
We have achieved our position
through poise, precision and audacity.

209
00:18:20,945 --> 00:18:23,134
To this we must now add resolve.

210
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:26,680
We'll be branded as traitors;
the gravest capitol crime.

211
00:18:26,888 --> 00:18:29,286
Punishable by death.

212
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:34,917
Couple hundred years ago, a few guys
named Washington, Jefferson and Adams...

213
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:38,202
were branded as traitors
by the British.

214
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:41,225
And now they're called patriots.

215
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:43,363
In time, so shall we.

216
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,254
God willing, in less than 48 hours, we
will evacuate this island in gunships...

217
00:18:49,358 --> 00:18:52,747
under cover of hostages
and V.X. gas warheads.

218
00:18:52,852 --> 00:18:56,345
Your destination:
a nonextradition-treaty country.

219
00:18:56,553 --> 00:19:00,672
You will each be paid a fee
of $1 million for services rendered.

220
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:05,364
But you can never again
set foot on your native soil.

221
00:19:05,416 --> 00:19:08,909
- Can you live with that?
- Yes, sir!

222
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:11,725
The men of Marine Force Recon
are selected...

223
00:19:11,881 --> 00:19:15,948
to carry out illegal operations
throughout the world.

224
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:18,815
When they don't come home...

225
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,787
their families are told fairy tales
about what happened to them...

226
00:19:21,891 --> 00:19:25,123
and denied compensation.

227
00:19:25,176 --> 00:19:28,617
Well, I have choked
on these lies my entire career.

228
00:19:28,721 --> 00:19:31,223
Well, here and now
the lies stop!

229
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:40,816
God be with all of you.
Man your positions, men.

230
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:47,125
This is FBI Director Womack.

231
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:50,670
Director... be advised,

232
00:19:50,826 --> 00:19:53,642
81... I say again,

233
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:57,552
81 civilians are under my control
as of this moment.

234
00:19:57,604 --> 00:20:01,879
You are to take measures to assure this
remains a need-to-know classified fact.

235
00:20:01,983 --> 00:20:06,154
- Who is this?
- Mr. Director, you have
a very serious problem.

236
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:09,439
A battery of V.X. gas rockets
is presently deployed to deliver...

237
00:20:09,543 --> 00:20:14,235
a highly-lethal strike on the population
of the San Francisco Bay area.

238
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:16,216
I will call again at 0100 hours
to state my demands.

239
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,875
- I wanna know who I'm talking to.
- This is Brigadier General...

240
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:23,359
Francis X. Hummel, United States
Marine Corps from Alcatraz... out.

241
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:27,008
I'll cancel your reservations.

242
00:20:27,112 --> 00:20:30,553
Get the Pentagon
and call the San Francisco office.

243
00:20:30,606 --> 00:20:33,629
It seems Alcatraz
was just reopened.

244
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,696
Last night, Gen. Hummel using
brutal but nonlethal force...

245
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,781
under the guise of
a security exercise,

246
00:20:39,886 --> 00:20:43,066
walked off with 15
V.X. poison-gas rockets.

247
00:20:43,118 --> 00:20:45,099
He lost one of his own men
in the process.

248
00:20:45,204 --> 00:20:48,905
That's Gen. Hummel in Vietnam.
I think he was a major at the time.

249
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:53,232
Three tours in Vietnam,
Panama, Grenada, Desert Storm;

250
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:58,133
Three Purple Hearts, two Silver Stars
and the Congressional Medal of--

251
00:20:58,237 --> 00:21:01,626
Jesus. This man is a hero.

252
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,920
Well, I think "legend" might be
a better description, Mr. Sinclair.

253
00:21:04,077 --> 00:21:07,726
Well, now we can add kidnapping
and extortion to his list of accolades.

254
00:21:07,882 --> 00:21:09,968
Mr. Sinclair,
Gen. Hummel is a man of honor.

255
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:13,305
General, it's him.

256
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:19,039
- Frank, it's Al Kramer.
- Hi, Al. How ya doin'?

257
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:21,750
I don't know, Frank.
Why don't you tell me?

258
00:21:21,855 --> 00:21:24,618
There are a lot of very,
very worried people here, Frank.

259
00:21:24,722 --> 00:21:27,068
I'll come straight to the point.

260
00:21:27,173 --> 00:21:30,301
83 Force Reconnaissance Marines
have died under my various commands.

261
00:21:30,353 --> 00:21:32,699
47 in Northern Laos
and Southern China.

262
00:21:32,803 --> 00:21:35,983
Southern China? We never admitted
we sent troops into China.

263
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,330
Who is this?
Identify yourself.

264
00:21:38,382 --> 00:21:41,301
White House Chief of Staff
Hayden Sinclair, General.

265
00:21:41,353 --> 00:21:44,846
How old are you,
Chief of Staff Sinclair?

266
00:21:44,951 --> 00:21:47,453
- I'm 33.
- Well, Mr. Sinclair,

267
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:50,634
you've probably got no fucking idea
what I'm talking about.

268
00:21:50,738 --> 00:21:53,136
By your ninth birthday,
I was runnin' black ops into China,

269
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:56,003
and my men were responsible
for over 200 enemy kills.

270
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:59,079
Now put some rigging tape
over Mr. Sinclair's mouth.

271
00:21:59,132 --> 00:22:02,573
- He's wasting my time.
- Ah, you want to continue, Frank?

272
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:04,867
Remember Operation Desert Storm?

273
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:08,672
Those surgical hits made by our
smart bombs covered so well on CNN?

274
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:13,417
It was my men on the ground
that made those hits possible
by lasing the targets.

275
00:22:13,573 --> 00:22:16,910
Twenty of them were left to rot outside
Baghdad after the conflict ended.

276
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:21,133
No benefits were paid to their families.
No medals conferred.

277
00:22:23,218 --> 00:22:28,119
These men died for their country,
and they weren't even given
a goddamn military burial.

278
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:31,977
The situation is unacceptable.

279
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,688
You will transfer $100 million
from the Grand Cayman...

280
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,660
Red Sea Trading Company account
to an account I designate.

281
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:40,684
From these funds, reparations
of $1 million will be paid...

282
00:22:40,788 --> 00:22:43,186
to each of
the 83 marines' families.

283
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:46,783
The rest of the funds
I will disperse at my discretion.

284
00:22:46,888 --> 00:22:49,130
Do I make myself clear?

285
00:22:49,182 --> 00:22:52,570
Except for the Red Sea Trading Company.
What is that?

286
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:55,594
- Identify yourself.
- This is FBI Director Womack, General.

287
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:59,348
It's a slush fund where the Pentagon
keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales.

288
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:01,903
Jesus, Frank!
This is classified information.

289
00:23:02,059 --> 00:23:05,344
You alert the media,
I launch the gas.

290
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,576
You refuse payment,
I launch the gas.

291
00:23:08,628 --> 00:23:12,590
You've got 40 hours--
'til noon, day after tomorrow--
to arrange transfer of the money.

292
00:23:12,747 --> 00:23:16,605
I am aware of your counter measure.
You know and I know it doesn't
stand a chance.

293
00:23:16,657 --> 00:23:18,742
- Hummel from Alcatraz, out.

294
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:22,079
All right.

295
00:23:22,131 --> 00:23:25,676
We have to identify the hostages
and contact each of their families.

296
00:23:25,885 --> 00:23:29,378
Tell 'em somethin'. Make up a story,
and we've got to keep this undercover.

297
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:33,757
If this comes out, the city of
San Francisco will be in chaos, anarchy.

298
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:37,303
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What is the potential casualty rate...

299
00:23:37,355 --> 00:23:42,099
for a single rocket armed
with V.X. poison gas, Gen. Peterson?

300
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:45,801
- Sixty or seventy.
- Well, that's not so bad.

301
00:23:45,853 --> 00:23:50,128
Thousand.
Seventy thousand dead.

302
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:52,787
- Oh.
- One teaspoon of this hits the floor,

303
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:55,498
it's lethal up to... 100 feet.

304
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:58,939
One teaspoon of this shit
detonated in the atmosphere...

305
00:23:59,043 --> 00:24:02,328
will kill every living organism
in an eight-block radius.

306
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,882
Get the point?

307
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,854
What did Hummel mean by
your "counter measure," General?

308
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:11,556
Standard poison is countered by napalm.
It consumes it upon detonation.

309
00:24:11,608 --> 00:24:15,727
Now, the problem with V.X. poison gas
is that it's designed specifically...

310
00:24:15,883 --> 00:24:19,115
to withstand napalm; that's
where thermite plasma comes in.

311
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:22,504
- Gen. Peterson?
- Thermite plasma incendiary systems...

312
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:25,684
can burn hot enough to consume V.X.,
but they're still in the test phase.

313
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,595
It's not operational.
Hummel knows this.

314
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:32,827
We are dealing with
one smart son of a bitch.

315
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:35,538
What's it gonna take
to equip a flight of F-18s...

316
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:38,249
with thermite plasma
within the next 36 hours?

317
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:41,794
- An act of God.
- Excuse me?

318
00:24:41,846 --> 00:24:44,245
All right. We can try.

319
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:48,311
But I strongly urge you to consider the
use of this as a secondary initiative.

320
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,814
Then we have to go to our
primary initiative. Uh, Admiral?

321
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,359
Sir, I'd like to bring in our SEAL
ground commander, Cmdr. Anderson.

322
00:24:54,515 --> 00:24:59,155
Mr. Womack, who is your best
chemical/biological man?

323
00:24:59,468 --> 00:25:01,658
That's interesting.

324
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:04,734
- Oh, yeah.
- That's very compelling.

325
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:10,000
Ahh, you like my pigtails?

326
00:25:10,104 --> 00:25:13,128
Oh, yeah.
Pigtails are naughty.

327
00:25:13,232 --> 00:25:16,099
- Naughty, naughty--

328
00:25:16,256 --> 00:25:18,967
You're just an amaretto cream
with peach sorbet persuasion.

329
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:21,939
- This isn't happening.

330
00:25:22,043 --> 00:25:24,389
- No, Stan. Don't answer it.
- This isn't happening!

331
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,891
- No, just don't answer it. It's okay.
- I have to.

332
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,185
- It's the office, baby.
They know I'm home.
- Oh-h-h-h!

333
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,096
- How could they possibly know
that you're home?
- It's the FBI.

334
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:39,248
- Stanley! Tsk!
- Goodspeed.

335
00:25:39,352 --> 00:25:42,115
Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll be--
I'll be down--

336
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,243
- Yeah, downstairs in ten minutes.
- No, you won't.

337
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:51,864
- I have to go to San Francisco.
- No, you don't.

338
00:25:51,916 --> 00:25:55,253
Stanley. No, you do not have
to go to San Francisco.

339
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:58,068
Right now, you need to stay here
and talk to me about things.

340
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:01,249
- I've got to go, baby.
- I am a Catholic.

341
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,699
Do you realize that?
I am pregnant, and I am unmarried...

342
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:06,202
and this causes
a serious problem for me.

343
00:26:06,306 --> 00:26:08,183
I cannot believe you.

344
00:26:17,359 --> 00:26:19,392
N-N-No.

345
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:23,041
- I love you.

346
00:26:23,093 --> 00:26:27,577
I will marry you.
I just didn't plan on this, that's all.

347
00:26:27,629 --> 00:26:30,601
- Come to San Francisco.

348
00:26:30,653 --> 00:26:33,677
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm sure it's just
a training exercise.

349
00:26:33,781 --> 00:26:36,127
Check into the hotel,
order up some champagne--

350
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,369
- And we'll finish what we started?
- Exactly.

351
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:40,611
- Baby, you gonna marry me?
- You know it.

352
00:26:40,663 --> 00:26:44,313
You're gonna marry me!
Oh, honey, come on.

353
00:26:44,365 --> 00:26:46,763
-Just a really quick one.
- Oh! Oh! I gotta go!

354
00:26:46,867 --> 00:26:46,972
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out, due to the full moon.

355
00:26:46,972 --> 00:26:50,100
A nighttime airdrop incursion
is out, due to the full moon.

356
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,237
Likewise,
a frontal seaside attack.

357
00:26:52,341 --> 00:26:55,261
If we're compromised and shots
are fired, Hummel might launch.

358
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:58,076
Our only alternative is an attack
from within the prison.

359
00:26:58,129 --> 00:27:01,622
We penetrate the island through tunnels
under the prison buildings undetected...

360
00:27:01,726 --> 00:27:04,906
and emerge in its center; that way,
we can jump the marines from behind.

361
00:27:05,063 --> 00:27:08,503
And if we're lucky, take their rocket
positions without a shot fired.

362
00:27:08,608 --> 00:27:11,319
I don't understand. You-You've
studied the architectural plans?

363
00:27:11,371 --> 00:27:15,125
They're useless. Alcatraz has been
ripped up and rebuilt for years.

364
00:27:15,229 --> 00:27:18,253
- Under there is a maze of shit.
- There's no question, gentlemen.

365
00:27:18,357 --> 00:27:20,807
We need firsthand intelligence
of the tunnel systems.

366
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,092
- So what about the former warden?
- Died in 1979.

367
00:27:24,248 --> 00:27:26,594
All the guards
we contacted were useless.

368
00:27:26,699 --> 00:27:30,870
Umm... there is someone who,
I think, can help us.

369
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,813
This is for the sake
of national security.

370
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:41,192
No, it's the sake of national security
that got us here in the first place
33 years ago.

371
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:44,685
I knew someday this would come back
to bite us. Forget it.

372
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,866
- He does not exist.
- He does exist!

373
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:51,567
We chose to forget him for 30 years.
We locked him up and threw away the key.

374
00:27:51,619 --> 00:27:53,757
Oh, and a lot of
goddamn good it did us.

375
00:27:53,861 --> 00:27:57,094
He broke out of two maximum security
prisons, and if he hits the streets--

376
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,544
He's not gonna "hit the streets," Jim!

377
00:27:59,596 --> 00:28:02,620
Thirty years ago, he was
a highly-trained S.A.S. operative.

378
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:07,469
He is my age now, for Christ's sake.
I have to get up three times a night
to take a piss.

379
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:10,075
We can't risk letting him out.

380
00:28:10,128 --> 00:28:13,516
He's a professional
escape artist.

381
00:28:45,163 --> 00:28:47,561
Oh, here he is now.

382
00:28:47,613 --> 00:28:50,376
- Ah. Neat, uh--
- Yeah.

383
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,879
- Neat, neat plane.
- Dr. Goodspeed. James Womack.

384
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:55,642
- Pleasure meeting you, sir. Thank you.
- Welcome.

385
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,988
You come very highly recommended.
B.A., Columbia;

386
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,125
M.A., PhD, Johns Hopkins.

387
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:02,367
Biochemistry/toxicology?

388
00:29:02,472 --> 00:29:04,922
Well, I'm one of those fortunate people
who like my job, sir.

389
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,946
Got my first chemistry set when
I was seven. Blew my eyebrows off.

390
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:10,918
We never saw the cat again.
Been into it ever since.

391
00:29:11,074 --> 00:29:13,368
- What do you know about V.X. gas?
- Liquid.

392
00:29:13,472 --> 00:29:16,235
Failed pesticide discovered
by mistake in 1952.

393
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:19,155
Actually, it's like champagne that way.
The Franciscan monks thought...

394
00:29:19,311 --> 00:29:22,700
they were making white wine, somehow the
bottle carbonated, voila, champagne--

395
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:26,298
- The gas, Dr. Goodspeed.
- It's very, very horrible, sir.

396
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:29,113
It's one of those things
we wish we could disinvent.

397
00:29:30,625 --> 00:29:32,658
This isn't
a training exercise, is it?

398
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:37,246
No, Dr. Goodspeed,
it's not a training exercise.

399
00:30:14,888 --> 00:30:16,765
- Ernest.
- Good morning, Director.

400
00:30:16,869 --> 00:30:19,319
This is Ernest Paxton, agent in charge
of the West Coast operation.

401
00:30:19,371 --> 00:30:21,874
- Dr. Goodspeed.
- Pleasure to meet you.

402
00:30:21,926 --> 00:30:24,429
- How do you do, sir?
- It's been a fairly
interesting day so far.

403
00:30:24,637 --> 00:30:26,827
The prison's here. Shall we?

404
00:30:26,879 --> 00:30:30,320
Now, my boys, they haven't been
able to find a file on this guy.

405
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:33,031
- Who is he, anyway, sir?
- His name is John Mason,

406
00:30:33,135 --> 00:30:36,993
a British national
incarcerated on Alcatraz in 1962;

407
00:30:37,097 --> 00:30:39,548
escaped in '63.

408
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,188
- I was under the impression that
no one escaped Alcatraz, sir.
- Paxton, don't argue!

409
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:48,411
This man has no identity, not in
the United States or Great Britain.

410
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:51,800
He does not exist. Understand?
I want one thing:

411
00:30:51,852 --> 00:30:55,866
how he escaped the rock-- specifically,
how he took through the island's bowels.

412
00:30:55,971 --> 00:30:57,952
Papers are in order, sir.

413
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:01,028
We're prepared to offer him
a full pardon.

414
00:31:01,132 --> 00:31:04,625
And Paxton, no strong-arming Mason.
I know him too well.

415
00:31:04,677 --> 00:31:07,492
Well, if you know him,
why don't you question him?

416
00:31:07,597 --> 00:31:11,507
No. He'll remember me. I don't want
his anger clouding the issue.

417
00:31:11,611 --> 00:31:13,540
All right,
I'll take care of him.

418
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:25,688
Mr. Mason, I'm special agent
in charge Ernest Baxter.

419
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:30,536
In charge of what? Fucking me over
for another three decades?

420
00:31:30,641 --> 00:31:33,612
I don't know anything about your
previous matters. I'm here because...

421
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:37,314
a special situation exists that we feel
you might be able to help us with.

422
00:31:37,366 --> 00:31:40,911
Now, what might that be? I've been
in jail longer than Nelson Mandela,

423
00:31:41,068 --> 00:31:43,362
so maybe you want me
to run for president.

424
00:31:43,466 --> 00:31:46,594
- Not exactly.
- Ah, pity.

425
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:49,931
- I feel rather like Alcamenes.
- Who?

426
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:53,424
Alcamenes. He was imprisoned
by his king in ancient Greece.

427
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:56,552
Like Sir Walter Raleigh.
Same fate.

428
00:31:56,604 --> 00:31:59,576
-James the First.
- Even someone as bright as you...

429
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:03,851
must be aware that, uh, there's
a certain pattern emerging here.

430
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,813
- Alexander Solzhenitsyn?
- Yeah, I heard of him.

431
00:32:07,865 --> 00:32:10,368
Didn't he play hockey
for the fuckin' Redwings?

432
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,975
- That's the chap.
- Get this straight, Pops.

433
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:15,373
I don't like you any more
than you like me.

434
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:17,927
But I'm here to make you
a legitimate offer.

435
00:32:18,032 --> 00:32:20,169
You wanna hear
what I have to say or not?

436
00:32:20,378 --> 00:32:24,132
By all means,
dear Paxton, by all means.

437
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:27,364
We got a problem in a place
that I think you know.

438
00:32:27,468 --> 00:32:30,127
There's a hostage situation
on Alcatraz.

439
00:32:30,231 --> 00:32:33,933
- Hostage?
- Eighty-one tourists.

440
00:32:34,037 --> 00:32:37,113
The Rock has become
a tourist attraction?

441
00:32:37,218 --> 00:32:40,971
Why don't we cut the shit, huh?
You know the Rock. You broke out.

442
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:44,517
- Yes, successfully.
- Yeah.

443
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:46,967
So why don't you do yourself a favor
while you're helpin' us.

444
00:32:47,123 --> 00:32:49,991
I mean, it'd be nice to get out of jail
while you're still vertical.

445
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,223
Hmm? While you got a little lead
left in your pencil?

446
00:32:54,944 --> 00:32:57,759
While I'm considering
your offer,

447
00:32:57,863 --> 00:33:02,034
I want a suite
at the Fairmont Hotel.

448
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:05,006
You know, I'm here
to cut you a deal.

449
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:09,437
I am not here to bend over
and take it up the ass from you.

450
00:33:09,542 --> 00:33:12,878
Here. Here's a quarter.

451
00:33:17,153 --> 00:33:19,917
Do yourself a favor.
Call your lawyer.

452
00:33:20,073 --> 00:33:21,950
You're goin' back to jail.

453
00:33:24,869 --> 00:33:28,050
- You're sending him back to jail?
- I'm not sending him anywhere.

454
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:31,438
I'm just givin' him
somethin' to think about.

455
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:33,680
I don't think we have time for him
to just sit around and think about it.

456
00:33:33,785 --> 00:33:37,799
- Oh, really?
- No, Goodspeed's right.
You, go talk to him.

457
00:33:37,851 --> 00:33:40,614
- Me? Sir, I'm not qualified for that.
- Yes.

458
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:43,951
- You're an FBI agent.
- What is your specialty again?

459
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:46,818
- Chemical weapons.
- Don't mention that!

460
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:53,127
- You want me to lie?
- Yeah, lie.

461
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:57,610
We got less than 24 hours.
Give it a shot.

462
00:33:59,435 --> 00:34:01,364
Okay.

463
00:34:06,474 --> 00:34:07,725
Hiya!

464
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:10,592
I'm an agent with the, uh,

465
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:13,355
eh, Federal-- FBI.

466
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:17,891
Uh-- Eh, well, my--
I'm Stanley Goodspeed.

467
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:21,384
- But of course you are.
- At least he got his name right.

468
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:26,076
- Of course I am.
- And you have an emergency.

469
00:34:26,129 --> 00:34:29,465
- That's right.

470
00:34:29,622 --> 00:34:33,949
- And you need my help.
- Exactly right.

471
00:34:34,053 --> 00:34:35,930
- Coffee.

472
00:34:36,034 --> 00:34:38,433
No, no, I'm fine,
thank you.

473
00:34:38,537 --> 00:34:40,727
Offer me coffee.

474
00:34:40,883 --> 00:34:44,167
Oh, yes. Well, that was, in fact,
going to be my next--

475
00:34:44,324 --> 00:34:47,139
Could we get a cup of coffee
in here, please?

476
00:34:47,191 --> 00:34:50,111
And offer...
to take these off.

477
00:34:50,163 --> 00:34:52,405
Mr. Mason, really.

478
00:34:52,561 --> 00:34:55,742
- All kidding aside--
- As a gesture of your good faith.

479
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:02,780
- Prisoner requests
to have his handcuffs taken off.
- No, no, no!

480
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:07,316
Look, why don't you go ahead and have
his handcuffs taken off, please?

481
00:35:07,368 --> 00:35:09,922
Well, I guess that's
one way to go.

482
00:35:12,633 --> 00:35:16,283
This is a pardon and release contract
from the Attorney General's office.

483
00:35:16,387 --> 00:35:20,871
Now, it makes you a free man...
provided you cooperate.

484
00:35:20,975 --> 00:35:25,354
So, if you'll just, ah, sign,
uh, eh, where it says--

485
00:35:25,407 --> 00:35:28,691
- "Signature"?
- That's-- Yes. "Signature."

486
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:34,217
Well... timeo Danaos
et dona ferentes.

487
00:35:34,374 --> 00:35:37,606
"I fear the Greeks
even when they bring gifts."

488
00:35:37,763 --> 00:35:40,161
Oh, an educated man.

489
00:35:40,317 --> 00:35:44,123
That rules out the possibility
of you being a field agent.

490
00:35:45,531 --> 00:35:48,555
In point of fact,
I am a field agent, Mr. Mason.

491
00:35:48,607 --> 00:35:50,744
- Really.
- Yes.

492
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:54,498
- In which field?
- Antiterrorism.

493
00:35:54,602 --> 00:35:58,617
Then you're trained in weaponry,
explosives and mortal combat.

494
00:35:58,825 --> 00:36:00,702
Well-trained.

495
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:04,039
- Then it's the Fairmont Hotel.

496
00:36:06,541 --> 00:36:08,418
Okay.

497
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:12,798
I want a suite...
a shower, a shave...

498
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:15,248
and the feel of a suit.

499
00:36:15,352 --> 00:36:18,533
May I also suggest a...
a haircut.

500
00:36:18,637 --> 00:36:22,182
- Am I out of style?
- Unless you're a 20-year-old
guitarist from Seattle.

501
00:36:22,286 --> 00:36:25,258
- It's a grunge thing.
- Grunge?

502
00:36:25,362 --> 00:36:28,386
Yeah. Well, uh, uh--
Okay. Thank you very much.

503
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:31,567
All right. Call the Fairmont.
Close the floor if necessary,

504
00:36:31,671 --> 00:36:34,590
but I want him sealed off
and he gets two hours max.

505
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,141
- Great job, Goodspeed.
- Why don't you throw in a trip
to Tahiti while you're at it?

506
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,122
I'll deliver this
to the Attorney General.

507
00:36:56,227 --> 00:36:59,355
Ah, no, you'll give it to me, Reynolds.
And take Attorney Reynolds outside.

508
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:02,066
There's a car waiting for you.
Thank you.

509
00:37:05,037 --> 00:37:08,478
That's a signed Federal document, sir.
Isn't that illegal?

510
00:37:08,635 --> 00:37:11,137
You're not acquainted
with the full facts, Goodspeed.

511
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:15,621
With all due respect, sir, I'd like
clarification. I gave that man my word.

512
00:37:15,725 --> 00:37:19,635
Damn it! You're on a need-to-know
basis, and you don't need to know!

513
00:37:21,304 --> 00:37:24,067
It's uh, eh, kind of curious,
but, uh--

514
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,351
Sir Walter Raleigh, Alcamenes,
Solzhenitsyn, they, uh--

515
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:29,437
Well, they were all
wrongfully imprisoned.

516
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:39,030
Womack!

517
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:43,357
Now, why am I not surprised?
You piece of shit!

518
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:45,912
- Hey, peace! Peace!

519
00:37:51,855 --> 00:37:55,244
Hey, we're not home. Leave a message.

520
00:37:55,348 --> 00:37:58,164
- Hi, darling, it's, uh, it's me.

521
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:03,846
Uh, listen, don't come to San Francisco.
I repeat, do not come to San Francisco.

522
00:38:04,003 --> 00:38:06,922
- Stanley, like hell I'm not comin'!
- Carla! Carla!

523
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,562
- Wait! Carla--

524
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:17,819
Who's Carla? And why don't you
want her to come to San Francisco?

525
00:38:21,572 --> 00:38:25,795
You're on a need-to-know basis,
and you don't need to know.

526
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:27,985
- Watch it, he'll bite you!

527
00:38:36,744 --> 00:38:40,654
Good. Mobile command
is fully operational.

528
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,313
We'll be there
in approximately two hours.

529
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:45,294
- I'm not armed, sir.
- Right.

530
00:38:45,346 --> 00:38:48,057
- I am unarmed, sir.
- Well, where's your issue?

531
00:38:48,109 --> 00:38:52,384
I left it in my--
uh, my sock drawer.

532
00:38:52,437 --> 00:38:55,356
A gun?

533
00:38:55,408 --> 00:38:58,484
For what?
You're a chemical freak.

534
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:03,698
No, I'm a chemical super-freak,
actually, but I still need a gun.

535
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:05,887
Give 'im a goddamn gun.

536
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,039
Have you fired one of those things
since the academy?

537
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:16,262
- # If you're going to San Francisco #

538
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:20,955
# Don't forget to wear flowers
in your hair #

539
00:39:21,111 --> 00:39:25,595
# If you're going to San Francisco #

540
00:39:25,699 --> 00:39:31,382
# You're sure to meet
some gentle people there #

541
00:39:31,538 --> 00:39:35,761
-# Gentle people there #
- # And you come for-- #

542
00:39:35,865 --> 00:39:38,785
- # If you're going to San Francisco #

543
00:39:38,889 --> 00:39:41,444
- Fairmont Hotel.
- Heh, uh, room service?

544
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:43,529
Uh, this--
this is the penthouse.

545
00:39:43,634 --> 00:39:45,719
Do you have any snacks
and drinks, huh?

546
00:39:45,928 --> 00:39:48,013
Hello-o-o.

547
00:39:48,117 --> 00:39:50,672
- You the barber?
- No. Stylist.

548
00:39:50,828 --> 00:39:54,373
- Barber.
-Just clippers, no scissors.

549
00:39:54,478 --> 00:39:56,980
No scissors? You've got to be
kidding me, no scissors.

550
00:39:57,137 --> 00:39:59,378
I mean, did they tell Picasso
"no brush"?

551
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,360
With scissors,
this man could kill you.

552
00:40:01,412 --> 00:40:05,374
I can't cut anyone's balls off
with a trimmer, now can I?

553
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:11,005
Why don't we do this outside?
Get some sun.

554
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:15,749
Oh! Who did this to you? This is
just not right. In fact, it's nasty.

555
00:40:15,853 --> 00:40:19,659
- Well, it's a... grunge thing.
- Well, it's some kind of thing.

556
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:22,892
Do you think we have time for a sea kelp
protein pack and maybe some color?

557
00:40:22,996 --> 00:40:26,854
- No.
- Okay.

558
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,200
- Not very nice, is he?

559
00:40:29,304 --> 00:40:32,432
- No, he's not.

560
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:47,604
# 'Cause I'm leavin' #

561
00:40:47,656 --> 00:40:50,784
- # On a jet plane #
- Hey, can't let it go to waste.

562
00:40:50,888 --> 00:40:54,069
- # Don't know when I'll be back again #
- Don't you ever stop eatin'?

563
00:40:54,173 --> 00:40:56,258
- Not when it's free.

564
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:59,699
- We're supposed to be on duty.
- Hey, don't worry. He's an old man.

565
00:40:59,803 --> 00:41:02,827
The boss is watchin' 'im.
Come on, Try some of this lobster.

566
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:06,633
-Mm-hmm.
-My secretary here will settle the bill.

567
00:41:06,685 --> 00:41:10,387
So, what do you have in store for me,
Womack, when this is over?

568
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:13,202
You'll get your life back, Mason.

569
00:41:13,307 --> 00:41:16,383
But you could've given me
my life back years ago.

570
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:22,378
Why should I trust you now?

571
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:24,568
You've got my word.

572
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,601
Will you shake on it?

573
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,635
- Freeze, mister!

574
00:41:39,739 --> 00:41:41,616
Oh, man!

575
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:44,640
Help!

576
00:41:44,744 --> 00:41:47,977
Drop the gun...
or I drop your boss.

577
00:41:48,133 --> 00:41:51,939
- You will not!
- Aaah! Get!

578
00:41:52,043 --> 00:41:56,631
- He's gettin' very heavy.
- Then pull him up!

579
00:41:56,683 --> 00:41:58,717
Aah! Uuh!

580
00:41:58,873 --> 00:42:01,480
- Please don't.

581
00:42:01,636 --> 00:42:03,357
- Ohh!

582
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:06,172
Help! Shit!

583
00:42:06,328 --> 00:42:09,039
-# Hold me like you'll never--#
- Come on, have a scallop. Catch.

584
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:12,324
Ohh!

585
00:42:13,627 --> 00:42:15,869
Ooh-ooh!

586
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:19,884
- You hoist him in!
- Yaah! Oh!

587
00:42:19,936 --> 00:42:21,760
Help! Help! Help!

588
00:42:21,865 --> 00:42:24,680
- Where's Mason?
- Hang on!

589
00:42:24,784 --> 00:42:27,078
- Mason's gone!
- Gone?

590
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:30,467
- Clear!

591
00:42:30,623 --> 00:42:34,064
Living room's clear!

592
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:37,453
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

593
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:40,373
All units, this is Caretender. We have
a signal six. He's in the hotel!

594
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:51,113
Okay, I don't wanna know nothin'.
I never saw you throw that gentleman
off the balcony.

595
00:42:51,165 --> 00:42:55,388
All I care about is,
are you happy with your haircut?

596
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:58,620
- Aah! Easy! Aah!

597
00:42:58,672 --> 00:43:03,365
Watch it, you fuckhead!
You're gonna pull my arm out!

598
00:43:03,417 --> 00:43:05,919
Watch out! Aah!

599
00:43:19,735 --> 00:43:21,873
- Uuh!
- Watch it!

600
00:43:26,617 --> 00:43:29,693
- Hey, watch it!
- He's right over there!

601
00:43:34,907 --> 00:43:37,357
Uuh! Ah!

602
00:43:37,409 --> 00:43:39,234
Uuh!

603
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:48,097
Hey! Uuh! Ooh!

604
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:50,860
This is my Humvee. I don't want
any dings, dents or scratches.

605
00:43:51,016 --> 00:43:55,448
Or I'll have your ass. Hey!
Hey! Stop! Hey!

606
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:02,799
- I was inside with Jack Powell!

607
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:05,979
- Hey, call the guard!
- Go!

608
00:44:07,126 --> 00:44:09,785
FBI.

609
00:44:20,473 --> 00:44:22,975
Whoo!

610
00:44:28,502 --> 00:44:31,578
- Whoa! Whoa!

611
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:35,175
Suspect is in a black Humvee
heading west on California.

612
00:44:35,279 --> 00:44:37,365
Speed approximately
70 miles per hour.

613
00:44:44,403 --> 00:44:46,801
Get out of the way!

614
00:44:50,138 --> 00:44:52,640
I want a net put on this
son of a bitch, you hear me?

615
00:45:25,694 --> 00:45:28,666
This guy's hittin' every fuckin' thing
in sight tryin' to block us!

616
00:46:02,554 --> 00:46:04,952
Aah!

617
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,697
I hope you're insured!

618
00:46:18,091 --> 00:46:21,219
- Oh, well, why not?

619
00:46:36,182 --> 00:46:38,684
You're goin' down!

620
00:46:59,173 --> 00:47:01,728
- Hello?

621
00:47:01,884 --> 00:47:04,074
Sie haben meine Hummer gestolen!

622
00:47:04,126 --> 00:47:06,629
I'm only borrowing your Humvee!

623
00:47:10,278 --> 00:47:12,311
Information?

624
00:47:12,364 --> 00:47:14,293
San Francisco.

625
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:17,473
Uh, Jade Angelou.
That's A-N-G--

626
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:22,061
Welcome aboard, y'all.
How y'all doin' today?

627
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:26,388
Hang on!

628
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,488
- Holy shit!

629
00:47:42,967 --> 00:47:45,157
Whoa-oa!

630
00:47:46,825 --> 00:47:49,797
- Oh, no!

631
00:47:53,759 --> 00:47:56,001
We're gonna crash!
Save yourselves!

632
00:48:01,632 --> 00:48:03,613
Oh, my baby!

633
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:10,390
Oh, no!

634
00:48:22,851 --> 00:48:25,822
Oh, no.

635
00:48:28,846 --> 00:48:31,609
Oh! Oh, God.

636
00:48:32,548 --> 00:48:35,050
Oh, God!

637
00:48:53,246 --> 00:48:56,791
Hey, man.
You just fucked up your Ferrari.

638
00:48:56,947 --> 00:49:00,128
- Oh, no!
Baby's goin' down in flames!
- It's not mine.

639
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:02,578
- Neither is this.

640
00:49:06,592 --> 00:49:10,033
Damn! This sucks!
Where's that son of a bitch at?

641
00:49:10,138 --> 00:49:13,943
I'm gonna hunt him down!
That motherfucker ain't safe nowhere!

642
00:49:14,048 --> 00:49:16,550
- Chem Weapons, Isherwood.

643
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:20,095
Marvin, look up
Wolfburg Federal Penitentiary.

644
00:49:20,252 --> 00:49:22,233
The inmate is Mason, John.

645
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:25,205
Hey, Stan, listen. I'm gettin'
out of this government shithole.

646
00:49:25,309 --> 00:49:28,281
I'm goin' over to Orkin
to design Roach Motels. Cool, huh?

647
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:30,314
Look, I just stole
a kid's motorcycle.

648
00:49:30,366 --> 00:49:32,504
I'm not really feeling too good.
Wolfburg, got it?

649
00:49:32,608 --> 00:49:37,039
Yeah, I got it. All right,
Magrane, Masconi, Masters. No Mason.

650
00:49:37,092 --> 00:49:41,940
Go to February '76. Who was transferred
to Wolfburg from San Quentin?

651
00:49:42,201 --> 00:49:44,130
- This is weird.

652
00:49:44,182 --> 00:49:48,040
They got medical records,
they got place of birth-- Glasgow--

653
00:49:48,196 --> 00:49:50,178
Uh, but they don't have a name.

654
00:49:50,282 --> 00:49:52,367
Uh, wait a minute, wait a minute!

655
00:49:52,472 --> 00:49:57,112
They have next of kin, a Jade Angelou
of 32 Stenson Drive, San Francisco.

656
00:50:17,236 --> 00:50:19,165
Jade?

657
00:50:19,321 --> 00:50:23,388
No, I'm Stacy, Jade's friend.

658
00:50:27,507 --> 00:50:29,905
Were you afraid to come alone?

659
00:50:30,061 --> 00:50:32,303
Yeah.

660
00:50:32,355 --> 00:50:34,597
It's okay.

661
00:50:34,753 --> 00:50:37,308
I'll be over here
if you need me.

662
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,844
- Last photograph I had of you...
you were about ten.
- Yeah?

663
00:50:43,564 --> 00:50:48,517
Well, I found a picture of you
among my mom's things... when she died.

664
00:50:48,621 --> 00:50:51,489
Oh, yeah? Well, uh--

665
00:50:53,262 --> 00:50:57,849
- Why don't we take a walk?
- I got him. Palace of Fine Arts.

666
00:50:58,006 --> 00:51:01,916
Your mother, uh--
Ya know, well, sh-she was very special.

667
00:51:02,072 --> 00:51:04,471
Yeah, she was.

668
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:08,329
But I don't think we should romanticize
what happened between you and her.

669
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:11,092
Meeting in a bar
after a Led Zeppelin concert.

670
00:51:11,196 --> 00:51:14,481
Head out,
and I was the result.

671
00:51:14,637 --> 00:51:18,078
Well, I'd like to think
it would've led somewhere, if only--

672
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:20,059
If only what?
Six federal marshals...

673
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:23,239
hadn't kicked down our door
and dragged you back to prison?

674
00:51:23,344 --> 00:51:25,429
I'm sorry.

675
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:28,766
It's all right.

676
00:51:28,870 --> 00:51:31,842
- So they let you out?
- Yeah.

677
00:51:32,937 --> 00:51:35,856
That's good.

678
00:51:35,908 --> 00:51:38,880
What did you do?

679
00:51:44,354 --> 00:51:48,160
Jade, I don't have
a great deal of time here.

680
00:51:50,141 --> 00:51:54,886
But I'll be coming back,
and, uh, maybe we can--

681
00:51:54,938 --> 00:51:56,606
What? We can what?

682
00:51:58,118 --> 00:52:03,905
You know... you're almost
the only evidence that I exist.

683
00:52:04,114 --> 00:52:06,564
But I don't know you.

684
00:52:06,668 --> 00:52:09,327
That's what I want to change, eh?

685
00:52:13,446 --> 00:52:18,034
I've rehearsed this speech a thousand
times on the chance that we would meet.

686
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:20,745
Here we are... and I'm lost.

687
00:52:20,849 --> 00:52:24,290
Well, I don't know how I'm
supposed to be feeling either.

688
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:27,940
Jade, I'm not an evil man.

689
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:31,641
If you can believe that,
then it's a start.

690
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:37,220
Okay.

691
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:50,514
Is this about you?

692
00:53:02,453 --> 00:53:06,572
You broke out of prison again,
didn't you?

693
00:53:06,624 --> 00:53:09,179
- Why did you come to me?
- FBI, ma'am.

694
00:53:09,283 --> 00:53:13,819
Your father's working with us.
He's helping us resolve
a dangerous situation.

695
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:16,061
- He is?
- Yes, ma'am.

696
00:53:16,113 --> 00:53:19,502
Well, gee whiz, John,
I guess we oughta get goin', huh?

697
00:53:19,606 --> 00:53:22,890
Whatever you say, Stanley.

698
00:53:28,156 --> 00:53:30,502
Thank you for that.
You could've handled it differently.

699
00:53:30,606 --> 00:53:33,943
What do you say we cut
the chitchat, a-hole?

700
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:38,062
You almost got me killed twice,
and my jaw hurts like hell.

701
00:53:38,114 --> 00:53:40,929
- Good.
- Cocksucker!

702
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:44,474
If I had my way, you would be shipped
back to Wolfburg in leg irons...

703
00:53:44,631 --> 00:53:47,029
and caged like an animal for the rest
of your natural fuckin' life!

704
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:49,062
You wrecked half the city!

705
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:56,361
- Give me a hand with the system.
- Now, tell me about the tunnels.

706
00:53:56,413 --> 00:54:00,167
If you know the system, it will take you
wherever you need to go.

707
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:05,850
There's an intake pipe here, below
low tide. Is that our best access?

708
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:09,291
- Yes, that's exactly where I came out.
- Then beneath the cistern...

709
00:54:09,343 --> 00:54:11,846
there's a connection
to the abandoned septic system.

710
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:16,798
- How many feet is that?
- Ehh... 57 paces.

711
00:54:16,851 --> 00:54:19,040
Where do we go from there?

712
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:24,567
Where do you go from there?

713
00:54:24,619 --> 00:54:27,121
That's a good question.

714
00:54:28,998 --> 00:54:32,491
- I have no idea.
- What?

715
00:54:32,595 --> 00:54:35,880
I mean... I'll know
when we're all inside.

716
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:39,529
No. You're not goddamn goin'.
Show us on the blueprints.

717
00:54:39,634 --> 00:54:43,075
I can't!
My blueprint was in my head.

718
00:54:43,127 --> 00:54:46,620
I was underground
for three days in the dark,

719
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:49,852
just waiting
for the tides to be right.

720
00:54:50,009 --> 00:54:52,094
But don't worry.
It'll all come back to me.

721
00:54:52,303 --> 00:54:55,379
You're not going anywhere, Mason.

722
00:54:55,483 --> 00:54:56,995
Wait a second.

723
00:54:57,099 --> 00:55:01,478
This piece of work might be the only
chance those people over there have.

724
00:55:01,635 --> 00:55:04,346
If he's not going, then why the hell
did we get him out of jail?

725
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:07,683
- He's smart.
- I got him out to get you
people in, not go with you.

726
00:55:07,787 --> 00:55:11,749
If it's the only way of getting
the intelligence I need, then he goes.

727
00:55:11,853 --> 00:55:13,782
He'll fuck with you.

728
00:55:13,887 --> 00:55:17,640
You compromise my men's lives,
and I'll bury you out there.

729
00:55:19,569 --> 00:55:24,470
Now, Womack... you're between
the Rock and a hard case.

730
00:55:25,826 --> 00:55:28,641
Hmm.
How's your bowling arm?

731
00:55:31,613 --> 00:55:33,802
Dr. Goodspeed, the goal
is to take out the launchers...

732
00:55:33,855 --> 00:55:36,044
then neutralize
the V.X. chemical rounds.

733
00:55:36,096 --> 00:55:38,755
Well, we know the poison's
being kept in the prison morgue...

734
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:42,301
from the satellite thermal imagining,
which is right here-- these dots.

735
00:55:42,405 --> 00:55:44,490
Have you ever actually seen
one of these devices?

736
00:55:44,595 --> 00:55:46,628
No, sir,
but I've studied them.

737
00:55:46,732 --> 00:55:50,225
I should really begin briefing your guys
on defusing and detoxification.

738
00:55:50,382 --> 00:55:53,249
Got a really neat layout here
of the chem round as well as the rocket.

739
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:55,856
- So let's get rolling.
- That won't be necessary.

740
00:55:57,785 --> 00:56:00,444
Oh, it's very necessary, sir.

741
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:03,363
The power of this chemical
is way beyond anything you can imagine.

742
00:56:03,468 --> 00:56:06,179
An ecological disaster, sir.

743
00:56:06,283 --> 00:56:08,681
Plus, the devices themselves
are complicated.

744
00:56:08,785 --> 00:56:11,601
That's why you're coming with us.

745
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:14,989
I am?

746
00:56:15,094 --> 00:56:18,378
You're the expert.
What's your problem?

747
00:56:18,430 --> 00:56:22,653
You mean I'm going--
going out there... under the water?

748
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:27,763
Well, earlier today you wanted a gun.
Now you're getting a gun and a wet suit.

749
00:56:27,867 --> 00:56:29,848
Have you ever been
in a combat situation?

750
00:56:30,005 --> 00:56:33,133
- Define "combat," sir.
- Shep?

751
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:36,104
An incursion underwater
to retake an impregnable fortress...

752
00:56:36,261 --> 00:56:38,972
held by an elite team of U.S. Marines
in possession of 81 hostages...

753
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:42,673
and 15 guided rockets
armed with V.X. poison gas.

754
00:56:42,778 --> 00:56:47,053
Oh. In that case, no, sir.
Excuse me.

755
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,072
- Here.
- Ah, thank you.

756
00:56:58,314 --> 00:57:00,660
You don't look too good.

757
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:03,423
In fact, you look like shit.

758
00:57:03,528 --> 00:57:07,698
My stomach's doing hula hoops
around my ass.

759
00:57:07,803 --> 00:57:11,609
You all right? I mean,
you gonna make it through this thing?

760
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:14,007
I don't know.

761
00:57:14,111 --> 00:57:17,135
I always expected something
like this was going to happen,

762
00:57:17,239 --> 00:57:19,325
but nothing prepares you for it.

763
00:57:19,377 --> 00:57:22,609
Now I'm--
I'm responsible...

764
00:57:22,766 --> 00:57:25,425
for a whole city.

765
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:29,439
- Look, I know this isn't easy for you.

766
00:57:29,543 --> 00:57:31,889
Remember, you were trained
for this kind of situation....

767
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,870
and believe me,
it'll come back to you.

768
00:57:33,975 --> 00:57:36,634
Besides, you got the best SEAL team
in the country backin' you up.

769
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,179
Okay.
You're right.

770
00:57:41,482 --> 00:57:44,610
I'll be on the wire.
I'll help talk you through it.

771
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:49,094
There's something else.
It's terrible.

772
00:57:49,198 --> 00:57:53,108
N-No, it's wonderful...
except it isn't.

773
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:56,966
My girlfriend's pregnant...

774
00:57:57,123 --> 00:58:01,346
and she's...
just flown in to see me.

775
00:58:01,450 --> 00:58:04,109
You keep your mind on what you're
going to be doing out there tonight,

776
00:58:04,265 --> 00:58:08,123
and I'll send someone to pick up
your girlfriend and bring her
here to the command center.

777
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:23,868
- Hummel!
- Hello, Frank. Lou Linstrom.

778
00:58:23,921 --> 00:58:27,726
I'm at the White House
with General Kramer.

779
00:58:27,883 --> 00:58:31,637
Uh, Frank, uh, we're havin' a few
problems with the account transfer.

780
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,035
Don't tell me problems,
tell me solutions.

781
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:38,466
We've spoken to the President,
and I know that you're aware
of his stance on terrorism.

782
00:58:38,623 --> 00:58:42,846
- So what we'd like to do--
- This isn't about terrorism.
This is about justice.

783
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:45,817
It's about reminding people who found it
politically convenient to forget.

784
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:49,884
- This is goin' nowhere, Frank.
- Well, let me tell you what is:

785
00:58:49,988 --> 00:58:52,751
15 V.X. gas rockets into
the heart of San Francisco.

786
00:58:52,856 --> 00:58:55,045
You've got 17 hours
to deliver the money.

787
00:58:55,098 --> 00:58:57,861
Or be prepared to reap
the whirlwind, gentlemen.

788
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:04,117
What's the word from Mojave?

789
00:59:04,221 --> 00:59:08,913
General Peterson can give us no definite
assurance on the thermite plasma.

790
00:59:09,070 --> 00:59:11,103
That is the word.

791
00:59:15,795 --> 00:59:17,724
Green light to SEAL incursion.

792
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:37,796
Fall in!

793
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:41,550
All right. Listen up.
Mr. Mason will run point for us.

794
00:59:41,602 --> 00:59:43,740
Lieutenant Shepard will be
attached to his hip.

795
00:59:43,844 --> 00:59:48,432
You breathe, he breathes with you.
You piss, he helps. Understood?

796
00:59:50,048 --> 00:59:53,124
Dr. Goodspeed is our specialist.
When he neutralizes the threat,

797
00:59:53,281 --> 00:59:57,139
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

798
00:59:57,191 --> 01:00:00,997
Make no mistake, gentlemen,
we're in the fight of our lives,

799
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:03,239
against maybe the greatest
battalion commander...

800
01:00:03,343 --> 01:00:05,376
in the Vietnam War,
I shit you not.

801
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,391
Any questions?

802
01:00:09,495 --> 01:00:11,215
Let's load up!

803
01:00:20,391 --> 01:00:22,842
After you, ace.

804
01:00:44,061 --> 01:00:47,971
Pass out and activate
the Minicams.

805
01:00:48,127 --> 01:00:50,473
Everything set here?

806
01:00:50,630 --> 01:00:53,184
Minicams operational?

807
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:56,469
Roger that, sir.
We are on line.

808
01:01:00,379 --> 01:01:04,341
Shep, what's the status on the special
operational gear for Mr. Mason?

809
01:01:07,626 --> 01:01:09,503
Let's see, we have, uh,

810
01:01:09,607 --> 01:01:13,569
one quart of kerosene
and a squeeze bottle,

811
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:21,442
three washers
and waterproof matches.

812
01:01:21,546 --> 01:01:24,883
Use the green flares to signal
when the threat has been neutralized.

813
01:01:24,935 --> 01:01:28,115
Now, this is atropine.
If you come in contact with the gas,

814
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:30,565
you have 20 seconds
to inject it into your heart.

815
01:01:30,618 --> 01:01:33,068
Don't fuck with me on this.
It may save your life.

816
01:01:36,613 --> 01:01:42,192
I have three incoming bogeys
bearing 2-7-5. Range: 6,000 meters.

817
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:48,031
FBI Command Center?

818
01:01:48,135 --> 01:01:51,368
Oh, I would just love for you
to tell me what is goin' on.

819
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,766
- Nope.
- Stanley Goodspeed is my boyfriend.

820
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:57,676
- Actually, he's my fiance.
Where is he?
- Classified, lady.

821
01:01:57,780 --> 01:02:00,752
Okay, well you just sit here
and act like a Bureau bonehead, then.

822
01:02:00,856 --> 01:02:03,046
Hey, where are you--
Goddamn it.

823
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:10,606
Decoy choppers commencing
run to Alcatraz.

824
01:02:12,378 --> 01:02:14,620
I just lost one, sir.
I just lost one.

825
01:02:14,672 --> 01:02:17,383
We only got two flying in.
I just lost one.

826
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:18,634
Shit.

827
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:31,877
In my day, we did it all
with a snorkel and a pair of flippers.

828
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:35,109
- Your day?
- Yes, didn't you read my resume?

829
01:02:35,161 --> 01:02:38,133
I don't-- I don't know
anything about you.

830
01:02:38,185 --> 01:02:41,000
- I know something about you, Godspell.
- Goodspeed.

831
01:02:41,105 --> 01:02:44,129
Goodspeed,
Godspeed, Godspell,

832
01:02:44,233 --> 01:02:47,622
you never went
to any anti-terrorist school.

833
01:02:47,674 --> 01:02:50,593
So just make sure you don't
get us all fucking killed.

834
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:56,641
- We're going dark.
- Night vision!

835
01:02:58,309 --> 01:03:00,812
Raider One has dropped
below radar coverage,

836
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:04,097
heading around Treasure Island.

837
01:03:04,201 --> 01:03:07,537
Sir, we've got two bogeys
bearing due east and closing.

838
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:14,576
Decoys?

839
01:03:14,628 --> 01:03:17,600
- Prepare to deploy!
- Good luck, Commander.

840
01:03:22,657 --> 01:03:24,638
Sir, Raider One
is at the drop zone.

841
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:30,112
Stanley's not a very good swimmer.
I mean, he can't even snorkel.

842
01:03:31,363 --> 01:03:33,762
- Everyone, good to go?
- Good to go!

843
01:03:33,866 --> 01:03:37,567
- Good to go!
- Good to go!

844
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:49,819
So the S.D.U.s have been deployed,
and the Eagles are in the water.

845
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:02,905
Major, I want the perimeter
patrolled to the west end of the island.

846
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:05,095
Yes, sir.
Hendrix, you lead the patrol.

847
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:08,640
- Aye, sir.
- Let's move! Move out, move out!

848
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:08,857
The Eagles are on the Rock.
They've entered the cistern room.

849
01:05:14,070 --> 01:05:19,857
Thank you very fucking much, Mr. Mason.
You sent us into a room with no exit.

850
01:05:23,038 --> 01:05:24,967
Any ideas, Dillinger?

851
01:05:25,123 --> 01:05:27,730
Figure it out soon.
We're sitting ducks.

852
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:31,796
- Real tight on time.
- You stand by the door.
Until I open it.

853
01:05:31,848 --> 01:05:35,133
I'd like to know how you plan
on accomplishing that.

854
01:05:35,185 --> 01:05:37,010
Through here.

855
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:45,404
You're shitting me.

856
01:05:45,560 --> 01:05:49,366
I memorized the timing.
I just hope it hasn't been changed.

857
01:05:49,418 --> 01:05:53,120
You catch one of those
flame bursts, you're a corpse.

858
01:05:53,224 --> 01:05:56,404
- Thank you.
- Commander, you said never
leave his side, but, uh--

859
01:05:56,613 --> 01:06:01,566
- Stand fast, Lieutenant.
- Have a nice day.

860
01:06:23,932 --> 01:06:27,738
- Where'd you dig up this guy?
- That's classified.

861
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:38,113
Clear here, sir.
No motion sensors tripped.

862
01:06:38,165 --> 01:06:41,814
- Nothing.
- Well, tell them to stay out there.

863
01:06:41,866 --> 01:06:44,160
Sweep forward!

864
01:06:52,919 --> 01:06:55,057
Looks like he fucked us,
Commander.

865
01:06:55,109 --> 01:06:58,967
I knew it.
That son of a bitch jumped ship.

866
01:07:04,232 --> 01:07:06,370
Welcome to the Rock.

867
01:07:21,385 --> 01:07:25,347
- Mason.
- That's a no-no. That's the subway.

868
01:07:25,452 --> 01:07:28,945
- That'll drop you into the tunnels.
- Do it!

869
01:07:46,566 --> 01:07:50,060
Sir, the Eagles
have breached the tunnel system.

870
01:07:56,368 --> 01:07:58,870
You enjoying this?

871
01:07:58,923 --> 01:08:02,051
Well, it's certainly
more enjoyable than my average day:

872
01:08:02,103 --> 01:08:06,169
reading philosophy,
avoiding gang rape in the washroom.

873
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:10,653
Though it's less of a problem these
days. Maybe I'm losing my sex appeal.

874
01:08:15,189 --> 01:08:18,421
We've got seismic activity
in one of the storm grates. North side.

875
01:08:18,578 --> 01:08:21,289
Continue patrolling the area.

876
01:08:21,341 --> 01:08:24,625
Sweep forward.

877
01:08:24,677 --> 01:08:27,910
Commander, halt.
We've got movement.

878
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:30,569
They're hearing sounds above, sir.

879
01:08:30,621 --> 01:08:34,427
Stand fast.
Down, down, down.

880
01:08:39,693 --> 01:08:42,299
West storm drain's clear.

881
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:50,380
Ninety-seven paces
to the shower room.

882
01:08:54,603 --> 01:08:57,888
The Eagles are now at the access tunnel.
They're right under the shower room.

883
01:09:04,978 --> 01:09:06,594
Fiber optics.

884
01:09:10,505 --> 01:09:14,050
- Something's not right.
- I've got a bad feeling about this.

885
01:09:32,819 --> 01:09:34,852
Quiet.

886
01:09:45,227 --> 01:09:48,094
Motion sensors.

887
01:09:48,199 --> 01:09:52,421
- Beams cutting across manhole covers.
- Deal with it.

888
01:09:56,749 --> 01:10:00,659
Commander, the beam is hitting
some sort of reflective device.

889
01:10:00,815 --> 01:10:02,640
Possibly a prism.

890
01:10:04,882 --> 01:10:08,166
I want to use a mirror
to cut the beam,

891
01:10:08,323 --> 01:10:11,347
send the beam
back to its source...

892
01:10:11,503 --> 01:10:13,536
and then I'm
going to move the prism.

893
01:10:17,968 --> 01:10:20,418
We've got motion on a trembler
in the shower room, sir.

894
01:10:20,575 --> 01:10:22,660
We've got visitors.
Let's move.

895
01:10:25,684 --> 01:10:28,604
Got it. Good to go.

896
01:10:33,661 --> 01:10:35,850
Stand fast.
We'll secure the area.

897
01:10:46,851 --> 01:10:50,292
They're entering
to the shower room, sir.

898
01:10:52,846 --> 01:10:55,453
They're securing the area.

899
01:11:03,743 --> 01:11:06,610
Just sit tight.

900
01:11:08,383 --> 01:11:12,241
Drop your weapons!
Drop 'em!

901
01:11:12,345 --> 01:11:14,483
- Get back!
- Hold your fire.

902
01:11:14,639 --> 01:11:16,620
Drop your weapons.
Hold your fire!

903
01:11:19,592 --> 01:11:21,312
It's a fucking trap.

904
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:26,995
This is Gen. Hummel.
Drop your weapons.

905
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:28,820
Drop 'em!

906
01:11:28,924 --> 01:11:34,607
Anderson here, Gen. Hummel.
Commander. Team leader.

907
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:37,631
Cmdr. Anderson, if you have any concern
for the lives of your men...

908
01:11:37,735 --> 01:11:40,811
you will order them to safety their
weapons and place them on the deck.

909
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:42,219
This is not happening.

910
01:11:42,375 --> 01:11:47,797
Sir, we know why you're out here.
God knows I agree with you.

911
01:11:47,849 --> 01:11:52,125
But like you, I swore to defend
this country against all enemies...

912
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:56,295
foreign, sir, and domestic.

913
01:11:56,347 --> 01:12:00,883
General, we've spilled
the same blood in the same mud.

914
01:12:00,935 --> 01:12:03,855
You know goddamn well
I can't give that order.

915
01:12:03,907 --> 01:12:05,471
We're dead.

916
01:12:05,628 --> 01:12:09,069
Your unit is covered from
an elevated position, Commander.

917
01:12:09,121 --> 01:12:12,874
I'm not gonna ask again.
Don't do anything stupid.

918
01:12:12,927 --> 01:12:15,377
No one has to die here.

919
01:12:15,481 --> 01:12:19,861
Men following the general, you're
under oath as United States Marines!

920
01:12:19,913 --> 01:12:21,842
Have you forgotten that?

921
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:25,283
We all have shipmates
we remember.

922
01:12:25,387 --> 01:12:28,671
Some of them were shit on
and pissed on by the Pentagon.

923
01:12:28,828 --> 01:12:32,008
But that doesn't give you
the right to mutiny!

924
01:12:32,112 --> 01:12:34,876
You call it what you want!
You're down there; we're up here.

925
01:12:34,928 --> 01:12:36,857
You walked into the wrong
goddamn room!

926
01:12:36,909 --> 01:12:39,046
- Stand fast!
- Commander, one last time.

927
01:12:39,099 --> 01:12:41,132
You tell your men
to safety their weapons.

928
01:12:41,184 --> 01:12:43,947
- I cannot give that order!
- I am not gonna repeat that order!

929
01:12:44,051 --> 01:12:46,867
- I will not give that order!
- What the hell is wrong with you, man?

930
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:49,578
- Stand fast!
- Oh, my God!

931
01:12:49,630 --> 01:12:51,611
- Let's waste these fuckers.
- One last time.

932
01:12:51,663 --> 01:12:56,251
-Order your men to safety their weapons.

933
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:02,872
Cease fire!

934
01:13:22,006 --> 01:13:24,561
Don't go.

935
01:13:26,490 --> 01:13:28,367
Cease fire!

936
01:13:37,386 --> 01:13:39,159
Cease fire!

937
01:13:39,367 --> 01:13:43,590
Shit. Goddamn it.
Let go of me. Let go of me!

938
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:46,093
Don't, don't go.

939
01:14:23,734 --> 01:14:24,934
Fuck.

940
01:14:35,413 --> 01:14:37,342
It's over.

941
01:14:47,039 --> 01:14:49,489
Oh, God!

942
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,605
- We got some movement.

943
01:15:21,761 --> 01:15:24,785
- Who? Who is it?
- Two of 'em. Eagles 11 and 12.

944
01:15:24,941 --> 01:15:27,600
- It's Goodspeed and Mason.
- I knew it.

945
01:15:27,757 --> 01:15:30,885
I've gotta get a team together.
We've gotta move with the second option.

946
01:15:30,937 --> 01:15:33,075
What, and invite another
massacre? No way.

947
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:37,141
We've got a 60-year-old convict and
a lab rat. I'm telling you, it's over.

948
01:15:37,298 --> 01:15:39,852
Not for Mason, it isn't.

949
01:15:51,374 --> 01:15:55,389
Goodspeed,
I'm not gonna kill you.

950
01:15:58,100 --> 01:16:00,759
- Where are you going?
- Off this bloody island.

951
01:16:00,863 --> 01:16:02,844
What? Wh-- What for?

952
01:16:02,948 --> 01:16:06,546
Goodspeed, do you read me?

953
01:16:06,598 --> 01:16:09,048
It's for you.

954
01:16:10,612 --> 01:16:13,063
- Sir?
- What's the status?

955
01:16:13,115 --> 01:16:15,669
The status is, they're dead.
They're dead!

956
01:16:15,826 --> 01:16:18,068
It's just me and Mason.
Now he says he's leaving.

957
01:16:18,120 --> 01:16:21,561
That is unacceptable,
do you hear me? Unacceptable!

958
01:16:21,613 --> 01:16:24,949
Well, there's a problem, sir.
He's got a gun.

959
01:16:25,054 --> 01:16:26,983
What do you have,
a fuckin' water pistol?

960
01:16:27,139 --> 01:16:30,945
- No, sir.
- Go after him and stop him.

961
01:16:33,030 --> 01:16:35,324
I didn't want this.

962
01:16:35,377 --> 01:16:38,035
-Jesus, I didn't want this.
- We knew this might happen.

963
01:16:38,140 --> 01:16:41,216
- Well, maybe now they'll pay up.
- Maybe now they won't, Captain.

964
01:16:41,372 --> 01:16:43,875
Then maybe we need to execute
a few hostages.

965
01:16:43,979 --> 01:16:46,690
- Got a live one!
- Put a bullet in him.

966
01:16:46,794 --> 01:16:48,827
You heard him, end it.

967
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:50,861
Holster that sidearm, Captain!

968
01:17:09,369 --> 01:17:11,350
Sir?

969
01:17:14,687 --> 01:17:19,640
You made a terrible mistake. And more
of our brothers have died in vain.

970
01:17:19,692 --> 01:17:23,654
Damn you for forcing me
into this position.

971
01:17:26,886 --> 01:17:29,806
I need to talk to you.
Right now, alone.

972
01:17:29,858 --> 01:17:32,204
Now, you told me
I'm on a need-to-know basis,

973
01:17:32,308 --> 01:17:34,498
and I'm tellin' you right now
I need to know...

974
01:17:34,602 --> 01:17:37,887
who the fuck John Mason is right now.

975
01:17:37,939 --> 01:17:41,849
All right, you wanna know?
1962, J. Edgar Hoover...

976
01:17:42,006 --> 01:17:44,717
is head of the FBI,
some say the country.

977
01:17:44,873 --> 01:17:48,731
It's no secret he kept microfilm files
on prominent Americans and Europeans:

978
01:17:48,888 --> 01:17:52,381
de Gaulle, British members
of Parliament, even the Prime Minister.

979
01:17:52,485 --> 01:17:55,822
I mean, this guy had dirt
on everybody in the world.

980
01:17:55,874 --> 01:17:59,367
Yeah, I know all the cloak-and-dagger
stories. Where does Mason fit in?

981
01:17:59,471 --> 01:18:02,182
Mason was the British operative
who stole the files.

982
01:18:02,286 --> 01:18:05,050
But our Bureau agents caught him
at the Canadian border.

983
01:18:05,102 --> 01:18:08,386
Of course, the British claimed
they'd never heard of him.

984
01:18:08,438 --> 01:18:12,922
And we held him without trial
until he gave up the microfilm.

985
01:18:13,078 --> 01:18:15,060
But he never did.

986
01:18:15,112 --> 01:18:18,344
I'm surprised Hoover didn't
use his daughter as leverage.

987
01:18:18,448 --> 01:18:21,368
Hoover was dead in '72.
She wasn't born yet.

988
01:18:21,420 --> 01:18:24,861
Today, well,
it's a different bureau.

989
01:18:24,965 --> 01:18:29,293
So you held this guy without trial
his whole life. No wonder he's pissed.

990
01:18:29,345 --> 01:18:33,724
This man knows our most intimate secrets
from the last half-century:

991
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:38,677
the alien landing at Roswell, the truth
about the J.F.K. assassination.

992
01:18:38,885 --> 01:18:42,743
And Mason's angry, he's lethal.
He's a trained killer.

993
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:47,696
And he is the only hope
that we have got.

994
01:18:47,905 --> 01:18:52,128
Mason! Mason!

995
01:18:52,232 --> 01:18:55,360
There are 81 hostages
still up there.

996
01:18:55,412 --> 01:18:57,237
Yeah. Like me.

997
01:18:57,341 --> 01:18:59,948
You wanna play tough?
You wanna play tough with me?

998
01:19:00,052 --> 01:19:02,868
Okay, FBI!
Freeze, sucker!

999
01:19:04,171 --> 01:19:08,290
- I'll fire.
- No, you won't.

1000
01:19:08,342 --> 01:19:12,878
- Throw down.
- You're not the sort.

1001
01:19:12,982 --> 01:19:14,859
Let's find out.

1002
01:19:18,352 --> 01:19:21,063
I could; you, no.

1003
01:19:21,115 --> 01:19:24,348
Besides, your safety's on.

1004
01:19:24,504 --> 01:19:28,049
Goodspeed, have you
resolved the situation?

1005
01:19:28,101 --> 01:19:31,594
Not yet.

1006
01:19:31,699 --> 01:19:36,860
- He's got all the guns now, sir.
- Shit!

1007
01:19:37,016 --> 01:19:40,092
You're right, I don't use guns,
and I don't kick down doors.

1008
01:19:40,197 --> 01:19:42,439
- This is what I do.
- I haven't got my glasses.

1009
01:19:42,543 --> 01:19:46,818
What it says is,
"Chemical Weapons Specialist."

1010
01:19:46,870 --> 01:19:48,382
That's right.

1011
01:19:48,434 --> 01:19:51,614
I got a lunatic up there,
man, with 15 missiles...

1012
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:53,596
armed with some
really funky stuff.

1013
01:19:53,752 --> 01:19:59,383
That lying Womack.
You could've told my daughter.

1014
01:19:59,435 --> 01:20:03,918
It was classified.
Look, I'm in the same situation.

1015
01:20:04,127 --> 01:20:07,255
They've got my girlfriend
in the city with a baby on the way.

1016
01:20:07,359 --> 01:20:10,852
Look, I can defuse the rockets.
I really can.

1017
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:14,606
But I'm gonna need your help,
and I'm gonna need it right now.

1018
01:20:22,218 --> 01:20:25,033
Sir, this man's weapons
and tac radio are missing!

1019
01:20:25,138 --> 01:20:28,266
Shit, we got a rodent problem.
Flush the pipes.

1020
01:20:28,370 --> 01:20:30,925
There's probably a maze of
tunnels on this goddamn island.

1021
01:20:31,029 --> 01:20:33,636
- Check every access you can find.
- Sir!

1022
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:41,925
Even if you escape
from the island...

1023
01:20:42,029 --> 01:20:44,845
you can't escape the rockets.

1024
01:20:45,001 --> 01:20:47,347
So, where are you gonna go?

1025
01:20:47,451 --> 01:20:50,163
Go where?
What're you gonna do?

1026
01:20:52,926 --> 01:20:55,168
Show me where
the morgue is, Mason.

1027
01:20:55,324 --> 01:20:57,566
I'm out of here.

1028
01:20:59,599 --> 01:21:02,675
What about your daughter? Mason?

1029
01:21:04,604 --> 01:21:06,116
Rodents located.

1030
01:21:06,168 --> 01:21:10,235
The way I see it, you don't
really have any choice, do you?

1031
01:21:10,391 --> 01:21:12,633
I don't think you do.

1032
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:27,856
Move!

1033
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:32,444
Ooooh!

1034
01:21:51,630 --> 01:21:55,593
- They're on to us.
- Burn 'em out.

1035
01:21:57,730 --> 01:21:59,972
This mother's gonna blow big.

1036
01:22:41,107 --> 01:22:45,121
I don't understand. How could we lose
radio contact all of a sudden?

1037
01:22:45,226 --> 01:22:47,884
We've lost coms.
Still got 'em on locators.

1038
01:22:55,757 --> 01:22:59,041
- So what's it gonna be?
- What?

1039
01:22:59,094 --> 01:23:03,473
- How do you like your choices?
- I don't.

1040
01:23:03,629 --> 01:23:07,279
That's what I thought.

1041
01:23:07,383 --> 01:23:09,312
Come on.

1042
01:23:09,364 --> 01:23:12,127
This is the oldest part of Alcatraz.

1043
01:23:12,232 --> 01:23:15,881
Did you know it was originally
a Civil War fort?

1044
01:23:15,933 --> 01:23:18,905
Oh, really? Yeah, wow.
You know, I like history, too,

1045
01:23:19,061 --> 01:23:22,137
and maybe when this is over, you and I
can stop by the souvenir shop together,

1046
01:23:22,242 --> 01:23:26,621
but right now, I just-- I just--
I wanna find some rockets.

1047
01:23:26,725 --> 01:23:29,801
Don't tempt me.

1048
01:23:29,853 --> 01:23:33,451
We are going to the morgue.

1049
01:23:55,452 --> 01:23:58,737
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I'll do my best.

1050
01:23:58,841 --> 01:24:01,343
Your best?

1051
01:24:01,500 --> 01:24:04,889
Losers always whine about their best.

1052
01:24:04,993 --> 01:24:08,903
Winners go home
and fuck the prom queen.

1053
01:24:10,467 --> 01:24:12,344
Carla was the prom queen.

1054
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:16,098
- Really?
- Yeah.

1055
01:24:17,766 --> 01:24:20,633
Locators have them
approaching the morgue, sir.

1056
01:24:20,686 --> 01:24:23,240
Come on, come on,
you can do it, Doc.

1057
01:24:27,255 --> 01:24:30,904
Shit! Aaaaaah!

1058
01:24:31,113 --> 01:24:33,615
You must never hesitate.

1059
01:24:56,607 --> 01:24:59,474
I think you're shooting
too close to the rocket.

1060
01:24:59,631 --> 01:25:01,873
Him, but not the rocket.

1061
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:04,688
Any other news, professor?

1062
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:09,745
The rocket!
Not the rocket!

1063
01:25:16,366 --> 01:25:18,608
Aaah! Uhhh!

1064
01:25:24,134 --> 01:25:26,533
I got a little something for ya.

1065
01:25:36,126 --> 01:25:38,576
Yaaaah!

1066
01:25:49,889 --> 01:25:53,904
Uh, yeah, okay, that's just about
the most awful thing I've ever seen.

1067
01:25:55,729 --> 01:26:01,985
Mason... the second you don't
respect this, it kills you.

1068
01:26:02,141 --> 01:26:03,966
Put it over there.

1069
01:26:15,123 --> 01:26:17,990
You've been around a lot of corpses.
Is that normal?

1070
01:26:18,095 --> 01:26:21,327
- What, the feet thing?
- Yeah, the feet thing.

1071
01:26:21,379 --> 01:26:25,863
- Yeah, that happens.
- Can you do something about it?

1072
01:26:26,071 --> 01:26:28,678
Like what?
Kill him again?

1073
01:26:28,782 --> 01:26:31,181
Listen, I'm just a biochemist.

1074
01:26:31,285 --> 01:26:35,612
Most of the time, I work in a glass jar
and lead a very uneventful life.

1075
01:26:35,664 --> 01:26:39,418
I drive a Volvo, a beige one.
But what I'm dealing with here...

1076
01:26:39,574 --> 01:26:43,120
is one of the most deadly substances
the earth has ever known.

1077
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:45,674
So what do you say
you cut me some friggin' slack?

1078
01:27:01,993 --> 01:27:03,922
A really elegant
string-of-pearls configuration.

1079
01:27:04,078 --> 01:27:06,841
Unfortunately,
incredibly unstable.

1080
01:27:06,946 --> 01:27:09,031
What exactly
does this stuff do?

1081
01:27:09,135 --> 01:27:13,202
If the rocket renders it aerosol, it can
take out the entire city of people.

1082
01:27:13,306 --> 01:27:17,633
Really? What happens
if you drop one?

1083
01:27:17,738 --> 01:27:20,657
Happily, it'll just
wipe out you and me.

1084
01:27:20,814 --> 01:27:24,098
- How?
- It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.

1085
01:27:24,255 --> 01:27:27,539
It stops the brain from sending messages
down the spinal cord within 30 seconds.

1086
01:27:27,591 --> 01:27:30,667
Any epidermal exposure
or inhalation, and you'll know.

1087
01:27:30,824 --> 01:27:35,516
A twinge at the small of your back as
the poison seizes your nervous system.

1088
01:27:35,620 --> 01:27:37,236
Do not move that!

1089
01:27:39,739 --> 01:27:42,867
Your muscles freeze,
you can't breathe...

1090
01:27:42,919 --> 01:27:45,943
you spasm so hard you break
your own back, spit your guts out.

1091
01:27:46,047 --> 01:27:51,574
- But that's after your skin melts off.
- My God.

1092
01:27:51,678 --> 01:27:55,014
Well, I think we'd like God
on our side at the moment, don't you?

1093
01:27:55,119 --> 01:27:59,446
So what I'm doing now is removing
the guidance system chips...

1094
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:02,887
so the rocket'll splash
down after 500 feet.

1095
01:28:02,991 --> 01:28:06,067
All right, let me have that.
You can let go of it.

1096
01:28:06,119 --> 01:28:08,778
All right, just back away.
Just back away!

1097
01:28:08,935 --> 01:28:12,636
Sir, morgue team
has not checked in.

1098
01:28:14,722 --> 01:28:16,859
Blackbird One,
it's Blackbird, over.

1099
01:28:16,911 --> 01:28:21,760
Blackbird One, this is Blackbird.
Come in, goddamn it!

1100
01:28:23,950 --> 01:28:27,495
Somebody's still there.
Let's move!

1101
01:28:27,599 --> 01:28:29,945
Rats alive! Close on the morgue!
Close on the morgue!

1102
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:32,031
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

1103
01:28:32,135 --> 01:28:35,576
Frye, Darrow, hustle up.
We got more company!

1104
01:28:39,121 --> 01:28:43,865
Hold it! Converge
on the morgue! Move out!

1105
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:47,306
Goodspeed, come on.
Come over here.

1106
01:28:47,358 --> 01:28:50,852
Yeah, I love pressure,
I eat it for breakfast.

1107
01:28:50,904 --> 01:28:52,624
Come on. Time's up.

1108
01:28:52,676 --> 01:28:55,857
There's three rockets somewhere else.
We have to find them!

1109
01:28:58,359 --> 01:28:59,298
Come on!

1110
01:28:59,298 --> 01:29:00,862
Come on!

1111
01:29:18,223 --> 01:29:19,735
Clear!

1112
01:29:22,863 --> 01:29:26,252
- I'm too old for this!
- Where's it go?

1113
01:29:26,356 --> 01:29:28,493
I've no idea.

1114
01:29:28,598 --> 01:29:31,204
Sir, all the guidance
chips are gone.

1115
01:29:31,309 --> 01:29:34,280
Captain, I guess you didn't quite
take care of the rat problem.

1116
01:29:34,385 --> 01:29:35,844
No, sir.

1117
01:29:36,001 --> 01:29:38,868
Well, there are two dead men who
strongly suggest you go finish the job.

1118
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:41,579
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

1119
01:29:49,869 --> 01:29:53,466
-You really don't know where this goes?
-No, I don't know where it goes.

1120
01:29:53,623 --> 01:29:56,855
Well, we're picking up speed.
Do you know how to slow it down?

1121
01:29:56,907 --> 01:29:58,419
No, I don't.

1122
01:30:07,126 --> 01:30:09,368
Aaaaaaah!

1123
01:30:11,140 --> 01:30:13,851
Uhhh!

1124
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:26,624
God!

1125
01:30:33,923 --> 01:30:38,094
Mason! You all right?

1126
01:30:38,303 --> 01:30:41,796
Yes, perfectly okay,
you fucking idiot.

1127
01:30:43,829 --> 01:30:45,862
They're coming.

1128
01:30:45,915 --> 01:30:48,469
- Who?
- The marines!

1129
01:30:48,626 --> 01:30:49,720
Where?

1130
01:31:51,814 --> 01:31:55,046
- What the fuck's goin' on?
- Let's cut him off.

1131
01:32:18,403 --> 01:32:19,654
Mason!

1132
01:32:23,304 --> 01:32:25,598
Mason!

1133
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:46,303
You motherfucker, die, die, die!

1134
01:34:06,740 --> 01:34:10,129
I'm rather glad
you didn't hesitate too long.

1135
01:34:13,257 --> 01:34:17,167
How do you do it?

1136
01:34:17,324 --> 01:34:22,954
Oh, I was trained by the best.
British Intelligence.

1137
01:34:23,059 --> 01:34:25,874
Come on.

1138
01:34:25,978 --> 01:34:31,035
But in retrospect, I'd rather
have been a poet or a farmer.

1139
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,173
Okay.

1140
01:34:37,292 --> 01:34:40,628
Okay, the president
arrives in three hours.

1141
01:34:40,733 --> 01:34:44,904
His directive is to string Hummel along
until the air strike is operational.

1142
01:34:45,060 --> 01:34:47,093
What's the word
from Mojave, General?

1143
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:52,202
Same as last time, Lou.
They're going as fast as they can.

1144
01:34:56,373 --> 01:35:00,701
Do it over here.
On your knees.

1145
01:35:10,606 --> 01:35:13,943
Navy SEALS, listen up.
You've got something that belongs to me.

1146
01:35:14,047 --> 01:35:16,498
Twelve guidance chips,
to be precise.

1147
01:35:16,602 --> 01:35:21,190
Let me remind you that there are lives
at stake, civilian lives.

1148
01:35:21,346 --> 01:35:23,067
Speak up.

1149
01:35:23,119 --> 01:35:26,091
- Speak up!
- Oh! I, uh--

1150
01:35:26,195 --> 01:35:28,124
- Uh--
- Tell them your name.

1151
01:35:28,176 --> 01:35:30,366
My name is Larry Henderson.

1152
01:35:30,418 --> 01:35:32,138
Oh, man.

1153
01:35:32,243 --> 01:35:35,058
And I'm a father
of three, and, uh,

1154
01:35:35,110 --> 01:35:37,925
they've got a gun to my head.

1155
01:35:38,134 --> 01:35:41,888
You've got exactly three minutes
to return the guidance chips,

1156
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:44,703
or Mr. Henderson
won't have a head.

1157
01:35:44,807 --> 01:35:47,570
Oh, no. Hey, what--?

1158
01:35:47,622 --> 01:35:53,514
Now, three to go.
You find them and defuse them.

1159
01:35:53,618 --> 01:35:57,528
- Okay? All right.
- All right.

1160
01:35:57,632 --> 01:36:00,969
I'll try and delay Hummel
and give you more time.

1161
01:36:01,126 --> 01:36:04,254
Hey, what about
Mr. Henderson's head?

1162
01:36:06,443 --> 01:36:09,363
Okay. What do you mean?

1163
01:36:14,316 --> 01:36:15,828
Okay.

1164
01:36:29,070 --> 01:36:32,511
- General.
- Who the hell are you?

1165
01:36:34,388 --> 01:36:36,734
I'm all that's left
of the enemy.

1166
01:36:50,863 --> 01:36:52,427
Bingo.

1167
01:37:01,290 --> 01:37:03,167
Stand easy.

1168
01:37:05,930 --> 01:37:10,309
Thought I'd been
in the service a long time.

1169
01:37:10,361 --> 01:37:14,637
- Name and rank, sailor.
- It's army, actually.

1170
01:37:14,689 --> 01:37:18,912
Answer the question.
And address him as "General, sir. "

1171
01:37:20,111 --> 01:37:23,343
Captain John Patrick Mason,
General, sir....

1172
01:37:23,447 --> 01:37:25,533
of Her Majesty's S.A.S.

1173
01:37:25,637 --> 01:37:27,358
Retired, of course.

1174
01:37:31,216 --> 01:37:33,979
You're a long way
from home, Captain.

1175
01:37:34,135 --> 01:37:36,742
How the hell are you
involved in this?

1176
01:37:36,846 --> 01:37:39,505
I have a unique knowledge
of this prison facility.

1177
01:37:39,609 --> 01:37:42,529
I was, uh...
formerly a guest here.

1178
01:37:56,501 --> 01:37:59,056
Hi, sweetie.

1179
01:38:05,886 --> 01:38:08,388
Hey, come back here,
little boy.

1180
01:38:10,265 --> 01:38:13,133
Did they bother to tell you
who I am, why I'm doing this,

1181
01:38:13,237 --> 01:38:16,156
or are they just using you
like they do everybody else?

1182
01:38:16,365 --> 01:38:20,119
All I know is you were big in Vietnam.
I saw the highlights on television.

1183
01:38:20,171 --> 01:38:23,872
You wouldn't have any idea
what it means to lead the finest
men on God's earth into battle,

1184
01:38:23,977 --> 01:38:26,219
and then see their memory betrayed
by their own fuckin' government!

1185
01:38:26,375 --> 01:38:31,328
I don't quite see how you
cherish the memory of the dead
by killing another million.

1186
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:35,186
And, uh...
this is not combat.

1187
01:38:35,290 --> 01:38:39,617
It's an act of lunacy,
General, sir.

1188
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:42,381
Personally, I think
you're a fuckin' idiot.

1189
01:38:48,637 --> 01:38:51,244
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed
from time to time...

1190
01:38:51,348 --> 01:38:54,632
"with the blood of patriots
and tyrants. " Thomas Jefferson.

1191
01:38:54,737 --> 01:38:59,533
"Patriotism is the virtue of
the vicious," according to Oscar Wilde.

1192
01:39:04,590 --> 01:39:06,571
Thank you for making my point.

1193
01:39:06,676 --> 01:39:11,003
Where are the guidance chips?
Where are the guidance chips!

1194
01:39:11,107 --> 01:39:13,349
I destroyed them.

1195
01:39:13,453 --> 01:39:15,278
That was a bad move, soldier.

1196
01:39:15,434 --> 01:39:18,354
Does that mean
you'll execute us both?

1197
01:39:46,247 --> 01:39:49,792
You're lucky that old man
Hummel wants you alive.

1198
01:39:49,948 --> 01:39:52,138
'Cause I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you, boy.

1199
01:39:58,811 --> 01:40:03,920
I'd take pleasure
in guttin' you... boy.

1200
01:40:04,077 --> 01:40:09,551
I'll take pleasure
in guttin' you... boy.

1201
01:40:09,603 --> 01:40:11,480
What is wrong with these
people, huh, Mason?

1202
01:40:11,636 --> 01:40:15,703
Don't you think there's a lot of, uh,
anger floatin' around this island?

1203
01:40:15,807 --> 01:40:19,040
Kind of a pubescent volatility?
Don't you think?

1204
01:40:19,092 --> 01:40:23,367
A lot of angst, lot of "I'm 16;
I'm angry at my father" syndrome?

1205
01:40:23,419 --> 01:40:25,817
I mean, grow up!
We're stuck on an island...

1206
01:40:25,869 --> 01:40:28,841
with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure
seeking psychopathic marines.

1207
01:40:28,945 --> 01:40:31,604
Shame on them!

1208
01:40:33,950 --> 01:40:37,183
Anyway, I only got one chem rod,
and there's two left.

1209
01:40:37,287 --> 01:40:38,851
Mason?

1210
01:40:39,008 --> 01:40:41,354
Yes, I'm here.

1211
01:40:41,406 --> 01:40:44,117
I was just thinking
how wonderful it was...

1212
01:40:44,169 --> 01:40:46,672
when the inmates weren't
allowed to talk in here.

1213
01:40:46,828 --> 01:40:49,487
Not allowed to talk.

1214
01:40:49,591 --> 01:40:51,677
How did you do it?

1215
01:40:51,781 --> 01:40:56,577
Nurtured the hope that there was hope...

1216
01:40:56,629 --> 01:41:00,122
that one day I'd breathe free air.

1217
01:41:00,227 --> 01:41:03,616
Perhaps meet my daughter.

1218
01:41:03,668 --> 01:41:08,099
Modest hopes,
but they kept a man alive.

1219
01:41:08,256 --> 01:41:11,384
What did they put you away for, John?

1220
01:41:11,488 --> 01:41:14,095
Oh, that's a long story.

1221
01:41:14,251 --> 01:41:16,806
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

1222
01:41:16,858 --> 01:41:20,560
When was the last communication
from our men on Alcatraz?

1223
01:41:20,612 --> 01:41:22,854
Seven hours.

1224
01:41:25,356 --> 01:41:28,641
- Thermite plasma is operational.
- Get me the president.

1225
01:41:28,745 --> 01:41:33,385
Be seated. Gentlemen,
consider yourselves on ground alert.

1226
01:41:33,437 --> 01:41:35,940
If we receive launch authority,
your mission is...

1227
01:41:36,044 --> 01:41:38,390
the complete thermal destruction
of Alcatraz Island.

1228
01:41:38,442 --> 01:41:42,613
The entire island is to be blanketed,
not one square inch missed.

1229
01:41:42,665 --> 01:41:47,931
81 American civilians and a number
of U.S. Marines will lose their lives.

1230
01:41:49,703 --> 01:41:54,969
Why didn't you just tell them where the
microfilm was and create a solution?

1231
01:41:55,125 --> 01:42:00,130
The moment they had the
microfilm, they'd suicide me.

1232
01:42:00,183 --> 01:42:03,311
- Some solution.
- You ended up here.

1233
01:42:03,415 --> 01:42:06,856
Which brings me
to another question.

1234
01:42:07,012 --> 01:42:10,453
You broke out-- let me see
if I can get this straight--

1235
01:42:10,557 --> 01:42:14,572
you went down the incinerator
chute, on the mine car,

1236
01:42:14,624 --> 01:42:17,596
through the tunnels
to the powerplant,

1237
01:42:17,752 --> 01:42:21,193
under the steam engine--
that was really cool, by the way--

1238
01:42:21,297 --> 01:42:24,478
and into the cistern
through the intake pipe,

1239
01:42:24,634 --> 01:42:29,326
but how, in the name of Zeus's butthole,

1240
01:42:29,378 --> 01:42:31,360
did you get out of your cell?

1241
01:42:31,516 --> 01:42:35,009
I only ask because
in our current situation,

1242
01:42:35,113 --> 01:42:40,952
well, it could prove to be
useful information, maybe!

1243
01:42:58,679 --> 01:43:01,546
Trade secrets, my son.

1244
01:43:03,371 --> 01:43:04,726
Wow.

1245
01:43:04,883 --> 01:43:07,281
General, two operational
rockets left.

1246
01:43:07,437 --> 01:43:09,783
One at the lower lighthouse
and one at the roof.

1247
01:43:09,888 --> 01:43:13,954
Both of the birds are ready to fly, sir.
General, can you hear me?

1248
01:43:14,058 --> 01:43:17,134
- I heard you, Captain.
-Just makin' sure.

1249
01:43:18,751 --> 01:43:21,722
Should we... prepare
for launch, General?

1250
01:43:23,078 --> 01:43:27,092
- I'll handle the strategy, Captain.
- Yes, sir.

1251
01:43:27,197 --> 01:43:32,306
The hour is approaching, sir. Just
letting the General know of the time.

1252
01:43:32,358 --> 01:43:34,391
I'm very aware
of the time, Captain.

1253
01:43:34,443 --> 01:43:36,737
Aye, aye, sir.
Lettin' you know.

1254
01:43:36,842 --> 01:43:39,501
Me and my boys are cocked,
locked and ready to rock.

1255
01:43:41,847 --> 01:43:43,932
Mason, where are you going?

1256
01:43:44,036 --> 01:43:46,904
Thirty years ago I vowed
I wouldn't die in this toilet.

1257
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:51,387
You're not leaving! There's a madman
in there with his hand on a button!

1258
01:43:51,492 --> 01:43:55,246
Shhh. Some sniper's
gonna get his ass.

1259
01:43:55,350 --> 01:43:58,061
Stop moving, Mason.

1260
01:43:59,468 --> 01:44:02,075
Mason, stop moving.

1261
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:05,360
Hummel won't do it.
He's a soldier, not a murderer.

1262
01:44:05,516 --> 01:44:07,758
I read it in his eyes.

1263
01:44:07,862 --> 01:44:11,512
Read his eyes? Oh, well,
then everything's just fine!

1264
01:44:11,616 --> 01:44:14,796
- I can't afford to take that chance.
- Why don't you talk louder?

1265
01:44:14,953 --> 01:44:17,403
Three minutes to go, sir.

1266
01:44:19,228 --> 01:44:22,095
- They're not gonna call for it.
- Oh, they'll call.

1267
01:44:22,252 --> 01:44:25,640
They'll call if we fire
one of our rockets up their ass.

1268
01:44:25,693 --> 01:44:28,612
Sir.

1269
01:44:33,357 --> 01:44:36,172
- Hummel.
- Hi, Frank, it's Al Kramer here.

1270
01:44:36,328 --> 01:44:39,091
- How's it going out there?
- How do you think it's going?

1271
01:44:39,196 --> 01:44:42,845
- We're gonna need another hour, Frank.
- You've got three minutes.

1272
01:44:43,002 --> 01:44:47,120
- We have to get authorization
from the president.
- You've got three minutes.

1273
01:44:47,225 --> 01:44:50,666
Frank, please
don't do anything stupid.

1274
01:44:50,822 --> 01:44:54,576
They want another hour.

1275
01:44:54,628 --> 01:44:57,912
That's bullshit. That's bullshit,
General. They're lying.

1276
01:44:58,069 --> 01:45:02,135
They're calling our bluff, sir.
They're playing you for a fool.

1277
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:07,349
Sir, order the launch, General.

1278
01:45:07,505 --> 01:45:11,050
Come on, General,
let's be all we can be.

1279
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,630
The mission's not complete!

1280
01:45:27,682 --> 01:45:29,611
Well, mine is.

1281
01:45:29,715 --> 01:45:32,426
When this is over,
you'll go back home,

1282
01:45:32,530 --> 01:45:37,222
driving Carla and your baby
insane in your beige Volvo.

1283
01:45:37,379 --> 01:45:40,924
And I'll be dead, or back in prison
which is the same thing.

1284
01:45:41,028 --> 01:45:45,356
You're not leaving.

1285
01:45:47,858 --> 01:45:51,873
All right...
I'll do it myself.

1286
01:45:53,072 --> 01:45:55,157
I got three weeks'
weapons training.

1287
01:45:55,313 --> 01:45:59,641
I'll kick the--
And a platoon full of marines.

1288
01:45:59,745 --> 01:46:02,508
No problem.

1289
01:46:13,509 --> 01:46:16,793
- Major, patch me into roof battery.
- Aye, sir.

1290
01:46:16,845 --> 01:46:20,808
Fire open control circuit
coordinates to the roof, sir.

1291
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:23,310
Let's go!

1292
01:46:28,628 --> 01:46:29,879
- Laser powered up.
- Oh, no.

1293
01:46:29,879 --> 01:46:32,382
- Laser powered up.
- Oh, no.

1294
01:46:32,538 --> 01:46:35,354
I said, on your knees!

1295
01:46:35,406 --> 01:46:37,908
My name's Stanley Goodspeed.

1296
01:46:38,065 --> 01:46:40,984
I'm a chemical weapons
specialist for the FBI.

1297
01:46:41,141 --> 01:46:43,070
- Uh, glass or plastic?
- What?

1298
01:46:43,122 --> 01:46:45,624
- Glass or plastic!
- Shut the fuck up!

1299
01:46:45,781 --> 01:46:49,222
Because if the winds change and if you
launch those rockets, we're gonna die.

1300
01:46:49,378 --> 01:46:50,629
Shut up!

1301
01:46:50,681 --> 01:46:54,539
And you're gonna end up
in a glass jar or a plastic bag.

1302
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:59,753
So do the math, hand over the gun
and let's go find some rockets!

1303
01:46:59,857 --> 01:47:03,142
I said shut the fuck--

1304
01:47:07,886 --> 01:47:11,431
You made the right choice.

1305
01:47:11,536 --> 01:47:15,759
I decided I didn't want your child
growing up without a father.

1306
01:47:15,863 --> 01:47:19,095
Hey, the last time I swam
this channel, I was your age.

1307
01:47:19,252 --> 01:47:22,223
So I'm fucked either way.
So come on.

1308
01:47:22,380 --> 01:47:25,195
The weapon is hot.
I am standing by for the launch command.

1309
01:47:25,299 --> 01:47:28,792
Man, killing Navy SEALs is one thing--
Is this for real?

1310
01:47:28,845 --> 01:47:31,556
Hey, it's business.

1311
01:47:34,162 --> 01:47:36,821
Access code entered.
Weapon available for release.

1312
01:47:36,873 --> 01:47:38,802
Launch coordinates:

1313
01:47:38,855 --> 01:47:43,130
six, seven, five, four, five, niner.

1314
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:46,936
The weapon is hot.

1315
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,907
I'm standing by
for launch command.

1316
01:47:50,064 --> 01:47:51,941
It's affirmative.

1317
01:47:58,405 --> 01:48:00,908
Standing by for command.

1318
01:48:08,937 --> 01:48:11,491
I'm waiting for
a launch command, General.

1319
01:48:19,572 --> 01:48:21,553
- Fire.
- Fire!

1320
01:48:27,497 --> 01:48:29,739
Missile loose!
Missile loose!

1321
01:48:35,317 --> 01:48:39,853
Origin: Alcatraz, 67253725.

1322
01:48:40,009 --> 01:48:43,972
- What's the heading?
- Heading 185 degrees south southeast.

1323
01:48:44,128 --> 01:48:47,621
- Speed?
- 300 knots. Headed right at Oakland.

1324
01:48:47,725 --> 01:48:49,342
The football game.

1325
01:48:53,304 --> 01:48:55,077
Oh, my God.

1326
01:49:18,068 --> 01:49:19,841
Missile radically
changing direction.

1327
01:49:26,201 --> 01:49:30,633
New direction: 275 degrees west.
It's headed out to sea, sir.

1328
01:49:30,737 --> 01:49:32,927
Oh, Christ!

1329
01:49:34,491 --> 01:49:38,349
Missile losing altitude.
Falling.

1330
01:49:38,505 --> 01:49:41,842
Falling, 300 feet, 200, 100.

1331
01:49:45,127 --> 01:49:47,994
Bogey detonated underwater.

1332
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:52,373
What the fuck?

1333
01:49:52,530 --> 01:49:55,867
- It missed.
- Well, that's great.

1334
01:49:55,919 --> 01:49:59,516
Extremely great,
but there's still one left.

1335
01:49:59,620 --> 01:50:03,322
What happened to the rocket?
What the fuck happened?

1336
01:50:03,374 --> 01:50:06,763
What the fuck is going on
to the coordinates? Sir! Major!

1337
01:50:06,867 --> 01:50:09,317
Captain, step outside.

1338
01:50:09,370 --> 01:50:12,133
- Talk to me, sir.
- Captain, step outside!

1339
01:50:25,532 --> 01:50:27,721
Get me the Pentagon.

1340
01:50:40,599 --> 01:50:42,997
What the hell was that, Frank?

1341
01:50:44,874 --> 01:50:48,158
- I said, what the hell--
- I heard what you said!

1342
01:50:48,315 --> 01:50:51,287
- I'd appreciate a little more respect.
- Cut the crap, General.

1343
01:50:51,391 --> 01:50:53,633
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm not ready to kill these people.

1344
01:50:53,737 --> 01:50:55,822
- Call the Pentagon. Ask for more time.
- No.

1345
01:50:55,874 --> 01:50:58,950
Do it, Frank!
We're coming loose.

1346
01:50:59,055 --> 01:51:02,131
You're coming loose.
The rest of us are in complete control.

1347
01:51:02,235 --> 01:51:05,155
- We're gonna ask for a new deadline.
- Put the phone down.

1348
01:51:05,311 --> 01:51:07,866
- The men are falling apart!
- The men are marines!

1349
01:51:07,918 --> 01:51:11,880
Are they?
I wanna talk to Gen. Kramer.

1350
01:51:11,984 --> 01:51:14,748
- You've been asked by an old friend.
- Put him on the phone right now.

1351
01:51:14,852 --> 01:51:16,937
- You've been ordered.
- This is Major Baxter!

1352
01:51:17,094 --> 01:51:20,378
Now you're being given your last chance
by a man with a gun.

1353
01:51:20,482 --> 01:51:22,620
Put the phone down.

1354
01:51:25,175 --> 01:51:29,554
- I thought you weren't ready to kill.
- I'm warming up.

1355
01:51:29,606 --> 01:51:31,796
At ease.

1356
01:51:40,450 --> 01:51:43,578
They need a decision,
Mr. President.

1357
01:51:49,470 --> 01:51:53,380
These past few hours...

1358
01:51:53,484 --> 01:51:57,811
have been the longest,
darkest of my life.

1359
01:51:57,864 --> 01:52:01,513
How does one weigh human life?

1360
01:52:02,869 --> 01:52:06,309
One million civilians
against 81 hostages.

1361
01:52:06,362 --> 01:52:09,750
And in the middle, Frank Hummel.

1362
01:52:09,855 --> 01:52:14,078
That we have ignored, abandoned...

1363
01:52:14,130 --> 01:52:18,561
or marginalized a great
soldier like Frank Hummel,

1364
01:52:18,613 --> 01:52:21,794
and American boys have paid
for that neglect...

1365
01:52:21,846 --> 01:52:25,287
with blood is equally real...

1366
01:52:25,391 --> 01:52:27,789
and equally tragic.

1367
01:52:30,292 --> 01:52:32,481
We are at war with terror,

1368
01:52:32,638 --> 01:52:36,131
and fighting war means casualties.

1369
01:52:36,235 --> 01:52:39,676
This is the worst call
I've ever had to make.

1370
01:52:43,847 --> 01:52:47,288
Air strike approved.

1371
01:52:49,634 --> 01:52:51,615
Red Thunder to Tower.
Request clearance.

1372
01:52:51,667 --> 01:52:55,056
The amount of firepower
they're gonna drop in there--

1373
01:52:55,108 --> 01:52:58,236
-This is strike leader. Prepared to go.
-It'll be over in a few seconds.

1374
01:52:58,341 --> 01:53:01,156
Flight time to drop point: 17 minutes.

1375
01:53:07,725 --> 01:53:11,114
Excuse me, General, sir,
with all due respect to you.

1376
01:53:11,166 --> 01:53:13,981
- What the fuck is going on?
- You changed the coordinates,
didn't you, General?

1377
01:53:14,138 --> 01:53:17,370
- That's affirmative, Captain.
- So now they think we're gutless?

1378
01:53:17,422 --> 01:53:20,133
The Feds?
They think we won't actually do it.

1379
01:53:20,185 --> 01:53:23,001
They're gonna come at us with
everything they got. Air and sea.

1380
01:53:23,105 --> 01:53:25,451
They're gonna bomb our ass
back to the Stone Age.

1381
01:53:25,555 --> 01:53:27,537
They don't know
we missed on purpose.

1382
01:53:27,641 --> 01:53:32,906
Great. We're not gutless.
We're incompetent. That right?

1383
01:53:33,063 --> 01:53:36,452
I don't think I like your tone, Captain.
We planned for this contingency.

1384
01:53:36,556 --> 01:53:39,528
Load the V.X. into the choppers,
take four hostages and evacuate.

1385
01:53:39,632 --> 01:53:41,874
The consequences of our actions
I'll face alone.

1386
01:53:41,978 --> 01:53:45,158
Excuse me, General, but
what about the fucking money?

1387
01:53:45,315 --> 01:53:47,765
There is no fucking money.
Mission's over.

1388
01:53:47,869 --> 01:53:49,642
Bullshit it's over.

1389
01:53:49,746 --> 01:53:53,239
You're talking to a General, soldier!
Maintain discipline!

1390
01:53:53,344 --> 01:53:58,036
I'm not a soldier, Major. The day
we took hostages, we became mercenaries.

1391
01:53:58,140 --> 01:54:02,937
And mercenaries get paid.
I want my fucking money!

1392
01:54:03,041 --> 01:54:05,595
This mission was based
on the threat of force.

1393
01:54:05,700 --> 01:54:09,349
I'm not about to kill
80,000 innocent people.

1394
01:54:09,506 --> 01:54:12,790
Do you think I'm
out of my fucking mind?

1395
01:54:12,842 --> 01:54:15,918
We bluffed. They called it.
The mission's over.

1396
01:54:19,411 --> 01:54:22,122
Who ever said anything
about bluffing, General?

1397
01:54:22,175 --> 01:54:24,990
Stand down, Captain.

1398
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:32,758
Stand down, Captain!

1399
01:54:37,346 --> 01:54:42,195
Major, I'm ordering you to take
these men to the choppers and evacuate.

1400
01:54:42,299 --> 01:54:45,688
That's a simple order, Major!

1401
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:47,877
It's not so simple, Frank.

1402
01:54:48,034 --> 01:54:52,726
Sgt. Crisp, secure the general.

1403
01:54:52,882 --> 01:54:55,802
I'm relieving you
of your command, sir.

1404
01:54:59,556 --> 01:55:02,371
Sergeant!

1405
01:55:08,888 --> 01:55:11,912
- I'll have that sidearm, sir.
- You mean this sidearm?

1406
01:55:20,931 --> 01:55:24,372
Maj. Baxter, you're either with us
or against us.

1407
01:55:29,951 --> 01:55:33,913
It has been the greatest honor
of my life to serve with you, General.

1408
01:55:38,188 --> 01:55:43,349
But like he said... it's over.

1409
01:56:00,867 --> 01:56:03,057
Let's get him.

1410
01:56:08,114 --> 01:56:10,721
Mason!

1411
01:56:11,868 --> 01:56:14,631
My God, what have I done?

1412
01:56:14,787 --> 01:56:18,593
Where's the last rocket?
Where's the last rocket!

1413
01:56:20,366 --> 01:56:23,389
- Where's the last rocket?
- Lower lighthouse.

1414
01:56:23,442 --> 01:56:26,101
- Lower lighthouse!
- Go.

1415
01:56:38,561 --> 01:56:42,263
Darrow, go to the lighthouse!
I'll take care of this fucker!

1416
01:56:48,623 --> 01:56:51,178
One, two, three!

1417
01:56:51,282 --> 01:56:52,794
Eat that!

1418
01:57:07,183 --> 01:57:08,591
Did it.

1419
01:57:39,664 --> 01:57:43,417
Come here. Come here,
you little chickensh--

1420
01:57:43,574 --> 01:57:47,067
You shoot me, I drop this.
We're both dead.

1421
01:57:47,119 --> 01:57:49,882
Come on. Come on.
Don't be scared. I won't hurt you.

1422
01:57:49,934 --> 01:57:52,124
- Come on.
- You know how this shit works?

1423
01:57:52,280 --> 01:57:54,366
You know how this shit works?

1424
01:57:56,868 --> 01:58:00,466
Come on.

1425
01:58:00,622 --> 01:58:02,655
I don't need a gun.
I'll put it down.

1426
01:58:02,812 --> 01:58:07,139
Come on. Let's play.
Come on. Come on.

1427
01:58:07,243 --> 01:58:11,883
Listen, I think we got started off
on the wrong foot. Stan Goodspeed, FBI.

1428
01:58:11,988 --> 01:58:15,168
Uh, let's talk music. Do you like
the Elton John song, "Rocket Man"?

1429
01:58:15,324 --> 01:58:19,599
- I don't like soft-ass shit.
- Oh, you-- Oh, oh.

1430
01:58:19,756 --> 01:58:24,865
Well, I only bring it up because,
uh, it's you. You're the Rocket Man.

1431
01:58:31,851 --> 01:58:33,885
How do you like
how that shit works?

1432
01:58:33,989 --> 01:58:36,074
Second rocket's away!

1433
01:58:43,842 --> 01:58:45,876
It splashed into the bay, sir.
No detonation.

1434
01:58:46,032 --> 01:58:47,857
Shit.

1435
01:59:08,867 --> 01:59:10,536
Darrow!

1436
01:59:11,943 --> 01:59:13,872
Open up!

1437
01:59:16,792 --> 01:59:18,356
Come on.

1438
01:59:18,565 --> 01:59:20,233
Open up!

1439
01:59:49,064 --> 01:59:51,879
Hey, you mothe-e-e-er!

1440
02:00:25,350 --> 02:00:28,635
Oh, I'm gonna
get you now, baby.

1441
02:00:31,450 --> 02:00:34,057
Okay.

1442
02:00:35,412 --> 02:00:37,863
Got ya. I got you, baby.

1443
02:00:37,915 --> 02:00:40,157
Come on.

1444
02:00:57,622 --> 02:00:59,603
Fucker!

1445
02:01:25,619 --> 02:01:30,102
Red Thunder strike leader.
Time on target: seven minutes.

1446
02:01:46,473 --> 02:01:50,383
English prick.
I tell you my old man was Irish?

1447
02:01:53,198 --> 02:01:55,909
Maintain air speed
4-5-0 knots.

1448
02:02:00,550 --> 02:02:02,739
- Aw, fuck!

1449
02:02:21,873 --> 02:02:24,428
It's me and you, pal!

1450
02:02:24,636 --> 02:02:27,243
I want that fucking chip!

1451
02:02:36,627 --> 02:02:38,608
I love pressure.

1452
02:02:45,855 --> 02:02:49,244
I know you're in here,
and I know you can hear me.

1453
02:02:49,348 --> 02:02:52,320
Now pay the piper
and come out like a man.

1454
02:03:22,246 --> 02:03:24,227
Increase speed to 5-0-0 knots.

1455
02:03:24,383 --> 02:03:27,824
You motherfucker!

1456
02:03:31,787 --> 02:03:35,801
I'm gonna choke my million bucks
out of you! You're gonna die!

1457
02:03:35,853 --> 02:03:38,825
- Eat that, you fucker!

1458
02:04:07,134 --> 02:04:10,628
All right, team inbound.
Time on target: 60 seconds.

1459
02:04:14,642 --> 02:04:18,604
On course heading 1-4-2 degrees.

1460
02:04:26,372 --> 02:04:28,562
When he neutralizes the threat,

1461
02:04:28,614 --> 02:04:31,742
we launch green flares
and we wait for the cavalry.

1462
02:04:36,487 --> 02:04:40,188
- Let's tighten up that formation.
- May God have mercy on your souls.

1463
02:04:40,293 --> 02:04:43,421
Please don't let this happen.
There has to be something you can do.

1464
02:04:54,109 --> 02:04:57,132
Let's drop to the deck,
100 feet below radar.

1465
02:05:07,247 --> 02:05:09,593
Target acquired.
Rolling in.

1466
02:05:13,034 --> 02:05:15,797
This is Red Thunder.
Master arm.

1467
02:05:15,849 --> 02:05:18,195
Master armed.

1468
02:05:18,299 --> 02:05:20,802
Time on target: 12 seconds.

1469
02:05:23,357 --> 02:05:26,432
- T.O.T.: ten seconds.
- Please.

1470
02:05:30,551 --> 02:05:32,428
Stay tight, gentlemen.

1471
02:05:34,826 --> 02:05:37,225
I got green smoke.
I got green smoke!

1472
02:05:37,381 --> 02:05:40,613
This is CQ-1, CQ-1. Green smoke!
We have green smoke, over!

1473
02:05:40,822 --> 02:05:42,855
- Gimme that, gimme that. Abort.
- Abort!

1474
02:05:43,012 --> 02:05:45,827
- Flight leader, abort, abort!
-Jesus Christ!

1475
02:05:48,017 --> 02:05:50,623
- I already dropped 'em.

1476
02:05:59,695 --> 02:06:01,468
Oh, goddamn it!

1477
02:06:02,615 --> 02:06:05,638
Oh, my God.

1478
02:06:05,743 --> 02:06:09,340
Get out of my way.
Let me through, please. Let me through.

1479
02:06:12,416 --> 02:06:17,682
The cells did not get hit.
The bombs hit on the back of the island.

1480
02:06:39,579 --> 02:06:42,446
- I'm fed up saving your ass.

1481
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:44,688
I'm amazed you ever
got past puberty.

1482
02:06:44,792 --> 02:06:49,797
I suppose all this will make
a great bedtime story to tell your kid.

1483
02:06:49,849 --> 02:06:52,717
You're insane, Mason.
The kid'll have nightmares.

1484
02:06:52,873 --> 02:06:55,219
I'll spend all my money
on shrinks.

1485
02:06:55,376 --> 02:07:00,850
Goodspeed, come in. Goodspeed,
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in.

1486
02:07:01,058 --> 02:07:02,935
Scanning all radio frequencies.

1487
02:07:03,040 --> 02:07:05,281
Goodspeed, do you read me?
Come in.

1488
02:07:05,438 --> 02:07:09,556
Goodspeed, do you read me? Come in.

1489
02:07:14,614 --> 02:07:18,628
Goodspeed?
Do you read me? Come in.

1490
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:20,348
This is Goodspeed.

1491
02:07:22,590 --> 02:07:25,927
Are the hostages alive?

1492
02:07:26,031 --> 02:07:28,065
Every one of 'em.

1493
02:07:30,880 --> 02:07:35,364
Goodspeed, it's Womack.
What about Mason?

1494
02:07:42,871 --> 02:07:44,748
He's dead, sir.

1495
02:07:44,852 --> 02:07:48,658
- How? When?
-Just come and get me.

1496
02:07:51,161 --> 02:07:53,246
Womack tore up your pardon, John.

1497
02:07:53,350 --> 02:07:57,052
But of course. I knew he would.

1498
02:07:57,104 --> 02:08:00,441
The S.D.U.s and the scuba gear
should still be where we came ashore.

1499
02:08:00,545 --> 02:08:02,787
If you can get
to the Pan Pacific Hotel,

1500
02:08:02,891 --> 02:08:05,289
there's clothes in my closet
and $200 in the bible.

1501
02:08:05,341 --> 02:08:07,323
Room 26.

1502
02:08:07,375 --> 02:08:12,223
Well, it's been a long time
since I've said thank you to anybody.

1503
02:08:12,380 --> 02:08:14,882
But thank you.

1504
02:08:17,072 --> 02:08:22,077
Well, Stanley, uh, this is when we go
our separate ways, huh?

1505
02:08:23,641 --> 02:08:28,177
Uh-- I'm sure you know the etymology
of your name, "Goodspeed. "

1506
02:08:28,281 --> 02:08:32,504
Yeah, "Godspeed. " To wish someone
a prosperous journey. Why?

1507
02:08:32,608 --> 02:08:35,528
Well, if you fancy a journey,

1508
02:08:35,684 --> 02:08:39,490
I recommend Fort Walton, Kansas.

1509
02:08:39,594 --> 02:08:41,680
I was thinking of Maui.

1510
02:08:41,784 --> 02:08:43,817
No.

1511
02:08:48,405 --> 02:08:51,429
Forget Maui.

1512
02:08:56,851 --> 02:09:00,292
"St. Michael's Church,
Fort Walton, Kansas.

1513
02:09:00,344 --> 02:09:03,368
"Front pew, right leg.

1514
02:09:03,472 --> 02:09:05,662
Hollow."

1515
02:09:05,819 --> 02:09:09,103
Is this what I think it is?

1516
02:09:10,667 --> 02:09:13,326
Mason?

1517
02:09:27,142 --> 02:09:30,374
- Congratulations,
Dr. Goodspeed. You did it.
- Thank you, sir.

1518
02:09:30,426 --> 02:09:33,763
You know, for a while there,
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

1519
02:09:33,867 --> 02:09:37,517
Well done, son.
So, where's Mason?

1520
02:09:37,621 --> 02:09:41,688
Vaporized.
Blown out to sea.

1521
02:09:41,792 --> 02:09:44,138
Blown out to sea, huh?

1522
02:09:44,242 --> 02:09:45,598
Yeah.

1523
02:09:45,754 --> 02:09:48,570
Poor bastard.

1524
02:09:51,906 --> 02:09:54,357
Goodspeed, where's Mason?
Where's his body?

1525
02:09:54,409 --> 02:09:56,859
I wanna see
that son of a bitch.

1526
02:09:57,016 --> 02:09:59,935
Vaporized, sir.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

1527
02:10:00,039 --> 02:10:05,357
What? Vaporized?
A body can vaporize?

1528
02:10:05,409 --> 02:10:08,381
Oh, yeah.
Absolutely, sir.
