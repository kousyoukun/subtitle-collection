1
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:47,214
<i>We can't hold out much longer, sir!</i>

2
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,870
<i>General Hummel, you've gotta
get us outta here now!</i>

3
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,581
<i>I won't let you down.
I won't let you down, son.</i>

4
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:30,799
<i>Goddam it, sir! How long do we have
to wait? I've lost 15 men already!</i>

5
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,511
<i>Sir, they're lightin'us up
like a firestorm!</i>

6
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,889
<i>This is General Hummel.
You gotta get my men outta there!</i>

7
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:39,516
<i>We don't have clearance
to go behind enemy lines, sir.</i>

8
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:45,355
<i>They're not coming for us,
are they, sir?</i>

9
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,953
<i>Congressman Weaver and esteemed members
of the Special Armed Services Committee,</i>

10
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,707
<i>I come before you to protest
a grave injustice.</i>

11
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,760
Aim!

12
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,139
<i>It has to stop.</i>

13
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,644
I miss you so much.

14
00:03:14,486 --> 00:03:17,656
There's something I've gotta do, Barb.

15
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,576
Something I couldn't do
while you were here.

16
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:25,581
I tried.
You know I tried everything.

17
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:29,918
And I still don't have
their attention.

18
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,881
Let's hope this elevates
their thinking.

19
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,383
But whatever happens,

20
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,013
please don't think less
of me.

21
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,641
Marine,
inform the garrison C.O...

22
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:28,560
that General Hummel's coming on board
with a security inspection team.

23
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:32,397
Yes, sir. Sir, it's an honour
having you, sir.

24
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,222
Ya know, at least
we can get some-

25
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:08,350
- A long time before guard meeting, huh?
- Yeah, I'll tell ya.

26
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:27,703
I got the access card. We've got
30 minutes till those darts wear off.

27
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,913
Move it!

28
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,627
The access card, sir.

29
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,257
Let's do it.

30
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,388
Twenty-four hundred
magazine check.

31
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,615
- Man, it's wet out there!
- Check me through, will ya?

32
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,960
Clear!

33
00:06:44,029 --> 00:06:47,199
- I want 16, Major!
- Move it!

34
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:16,061
Evac!
Seal the door!

35
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,312
- No! - Come on,
man! - No! - Seal it!

36
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,232
- No! - Seal
it! - Help!

37
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,904
Let me outta here! Oh, God!
Let me outta here! Oh, God!

38
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:28,073
Let me out! Let me out!

39
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,244
Clear out.
Get outta here!

40
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,920
Sorry.

41
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:49,595
Let's move out.

42
00:08:00,898 --> 00:08:03,400
Two more cc's
of acetylene chloride.

43
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:11,617
- That'll be five dollars, Isherwood.
- You suck.

44
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:21,210
You guys have too much time
on your hands.

45
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:25,214
Yes! She's here! Bring it
to me now. Thank you, Phil!

46
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:28,592
What's that?
Why'd you get it sent here?

47
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:32,804
Carla wouldn't approve. She thinks
it's dumb to spend $600 on an L.P.

48
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:37,226
Carla's right. Why don't you
just spend $ 13 on a CD, man?

49
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:39,478
First of all,
it's because I'm a Beatlemaniac.

50
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:41,980
And second,
these sound better.

51
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:47,152
Could be serious.
Could be sarin gas.

52
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:52,366
A dog out of JFK caught a whiff
of something in this package...

53
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:54,368
postmarked to
a Bosnian refugee camp.

54
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,787
It could be detergent,
or it could be sarin gas.

55
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:59,248
Bosnian refugee camp?

56
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:02,709
Half a million Serbians reside in the
U.S., Marvin. Serbians don't like Bosnians.

57
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:05,003
You guys wanna get
suited up?

58
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,760
- You bring the cockroaches?
- Got 'em.

59
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,889
<i>We have air lock, Stanley.
You're all set to go.</i>

60
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:22,688
October 1, 0900 hours.

61
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,483
<i>Agent Stanley Goodspeed,
Agent/Trainee Marvin Isherwood...</i>

62
00:09:26,608 --> 00:09:28,819
<i>initiating exam
of wooden crate.</i>

63
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:32,364
<i>Suspicion of
sarin gas inside.</i>

64
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,908
<i>- Marvin, sarin is a-
- G.B. aerosol.</i>

65
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:36,743
<i>That is correct.</i>

66
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:39,079
Now, let's see.
We have some dirty magazines.

67
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,082
<i>Stone Age Cave Girls
in the Raw. Kinky.</i>

68
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:45,377
And, uh-
Not a good sign.

69
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,589
Hello, little baby doll.

70
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,716
Lookit, Stan.

71
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,926
- Hi there, - Marvin! -
Stanley. - Marvin, don't!

72
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:57,055
- Hi, Stan.
- Shit! Move back! Move back!

73
00:09:58,557 --> 00:10:01,143
- I want the exhaust.
- Hang on, guys.

74
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,604
We'll have that room clear
in 50 seconds! You're gonna be okay.

75
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,689
Jesus Christ!

76
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:10,777
Okay, I've got some bad news
and some really bad news.

77
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:14,281
The bad news is that the gas
is corrosive and it's eating our suits.

78
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,492
<i>- It's all over my hand, man!
- The really bad news...</i>

79
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:21,288
is there's enough C-4 explosive and
poison gas to blow the whole chamber...

80
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:22,658
<i>- and kill everybody in the building.</i>

81
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:24,559
<i>- Detonation too heavy.
