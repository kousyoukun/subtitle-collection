1
00:00:36,372 --> 00:00:38,442
Here's my day, so far.

2
00:00:38,443 --> 00:00:42,521
Went to jail, lost the girl of my
dreams and got my butt kicked.

3
00:00:42,529 --> 00:00:43,754
Pretty good.

4
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:47,373
Still, things could be a lot worse.

5
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,265
Oh, that's right, I'm falling
to my death.

6
00:00:52,956 --> 00:00:54,412
Guess they can't.

7
00:00:55,177 --> 00:00:57,033
How did it all come
to this, you ask?

8
00:00:58,271 --> 00:01:00,046
My end starts at the beginning.

9
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:02,265
The very beginning.

10
00:01:05,922 --> 00:01:07,678
Yes, that's me.

11
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:11,303
I had a fairly standard childhood.

12
00:01:12,193 --> 00:01:15,256
I came from what you might call,
a broken home.

13
00:01:16,586 --> 00:01:18,660
Literally, broken.

14
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:21,884
I was eight days old and still living
with my parents.

15
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:23,931
How sad is that?

16
00:01:24,353 --> 00:01:26,425
Clearly it was time to move on.

17
00:01:26,429 --> 00:01:29,673
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.

18
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,434
And here is your binkie.

19
00:01:31,582 --> 00:01:34,650
You are destined for ...

20
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:36,464
I didn't quite hear that last part.

21
00:01:36,467 --> 00:01:38,105
But it sounded important.

22
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:40,836
Destined for, what?

23
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:45,620
I set out to find my destiny.

24
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:51,296
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt
quadrant had the exact same idea.

25
00:01:58,349 --> 00:02:01,501
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.

26
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:08,930
And our glorious rivalry,
was born!

27
00:02:13,646 --> 00:02:16,048
Could this be what I was destined for?

28
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:18,921
A dream life filled with luxury?

29
00:02:21,003 --> 00:02:22,226
Apparently not.

30
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,116
Even fate picks its favorites.

31
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,081
No big deal.

32
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:31,448
A much different fate awaited me.

33
00:02:39,378 --> 00:02:40,708
A baby.

34
00:02:40,971 --> 00:02:42,340
How thoughtful.

35
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:45,739
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.

36
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:49,528
Luckily I found a lovely little
place to call home.

37
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:50,952
Can we keep it?

38
00:02:51,582 --> 00:02:55,012
A place that taught me the
differences between right...

39
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,740
...and wrong.

40
00:02:57,209 --> 00:02:59,703
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand,

41
00:02:59,707 --> 00:03:02,277
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

42
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:03,704
Our baby can fly.

43
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:07,231
Yes, yes. Nothing but the best for you, Darling.

44
00:03:07,237 --> 00:03:11,636
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.

45
00:03:12,595 --> 00:03:15,542
But I had something far, far greater,

46
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:17,174
My amazing intellect.

47
00:03:17,182 --> 00:03:20,351
A knack for building objects of mayhem.

48
00:03:26,102 --> 00:03:29,710
After a few years, and with some time
off for good behavior.

49
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:34,039
I was given an opportunity to better
myself through learning.

50
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:37,735
At a strange place called shh-ool.

51
00:03:38,065 --> 00:03:42,141
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.

52
00:03:42,167 --> 00:03:46,244
He had already amassed a gigantic army of
soft-headed groupies.

53
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:57,685
He bought their affections with showmanship,
and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

54
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:04,645
So I too would make this 'popped-corn'
and win over those mindless dregs.

55
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:05,665
Lights out!

56
00:04:23,559 --> 00:04:26,134
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.

57
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,968
Good receives all the praise and adulation.

58
00:04:28,973 --> 00:04:31,992
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.

59
00:04:33,262 --> 00:04:35,668
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.

60
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:40,302
While they were learning the itsy
bitsy spider.

61
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:43,020
I learned how to dehydrate
animate objects.

62
00:04:43,025 --> 00:04:44,989
and rehydrate them at will.

63
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:51,069
Some day’s it felt like it was just me and Minion,
against the world.

64
00:04:51,971 --> 00:04:54,217
No matter how hard I tried.

65
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:56,406
I was always the odd man out.

66
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:58,280
The last one picked.

67
00:04:58,284 --> 00:05:00,813
The screw-up, the black sheep.

68
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:04,066
The bad boy.

69
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:17,095
Was this my destiny?

70
00:05:17,457 --> 00:05:20,141
Wait! Maybe it was.

71
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:23,955
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.

72
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,855
Then it hit me.

73
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:28,464
If I was the bad boy.

74
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:32,499
Then I was going to be the baddest
boy of them all.

75
00:05:34,232 --> 00:05:36,382
I was destined to be a super villain.

76
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,733
And we were destined to be rivals.

77
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,802
The die had been cast.

78
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:47,073
And so began an enduring epic,
life long career.

79
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:49,318
And I loved it.

80
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:53,791
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

81
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:58,544
He would win some, I would almost
win others.

82
00:05:58,697 --> 00:06:01,322
He took the name, Metro Man.

83
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,525
Defender of Montrosity.

84
00:06:03,526 --> 00:06:06,245
I decided to pick something a
little more humble.

85
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,315
Megamind.

86
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:12,214
Incredibly handsome criminal genius,
and master of all villainy.

87
00:06:23,379 --> 00:06:25,971
Read on your own time. Open up.

88
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Hey!

89
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:34,667
BOO!!

90
00:06:38,204 --> 00:06:39,855
Oh, good morning, Warden.

91
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:42,499
Great news, I'm a changed man.

92
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,542
And I'm ready to re-enter society
as a solid citizen.

93
00:06:46,545 --> 00:06:49,298
You're a villain, and you'll always
be a villain.

94
00:06:49,299 --> 00:06:50,665
You'll never change.

95
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,270
And you'll never leave.

96
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:55,222
-You're fun.
-You got a present in the mail.

97
00:06:55,223 --> 00:06:56,882
Is it a puppy?

98
00:06:56,890 --> 00:07:01,621
From Metro Man. To count every second
of your 85 life sentences.

99
00:07:01,677 --> 00:07:04,806
That's funny, never thought Metro Man
was the gloating type.

100
00:07:05,055 --> 00:07:06,683
Oh but he does have nice taste.

101
00:07:06,685 --> 00:07:08,085
I think I'll keep it.

102
00:07:08,086 --> 00:07:10,103
Any chance you could give me the time?

103
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:13,400
I don't want to be late for the opening
of the Metro Man museum.

104
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:17,029
Oh no, looks like you're
gonna miss it.

105
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,117
By several thousand years.

106
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,476
Oh, am I?

107
00:07:26,675 --> 00:07:29,731
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.

108
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,732
It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown where
we're here to honor a beautiful man.

109
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,508
Metro Man.

110
00:07:39,562 --> 00:07:43,881
His heart is an ocean that's inside
a bigger ocean.

111
00:07:44,212 --> 00:07:47,183
For years he's been watching us
with his super-vision.

112
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:52,131
Saving us with his super strength,
and caring for us with his super heart.

113
00:07:52,135 --> 00:07:54,778
Now it's our turn to give something back.

114
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:59,753
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from
the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.

115
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,643
Wow, okay, the stuff they make
you read on the air.

116
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:05,033
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.

117
00:08:05,034 --> 00:08:06,854
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

118
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:08,996
What I was trying to say was,

119
00:08:08,997 --> 00:08:14,711
I can't believe that in our modern society
they let like actual art get onto the news.

120
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:17,980
-Nice save, Hal.
-What are we, like lets just get
a coffee or something.

121
00:08:17,981 --> 00:08:21,070
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.

122
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:24,708
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind
wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

123
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:26,078
That's the first thing.

124
00:08:26,481 --> 00:08:27,532
That's sweet of you.

125
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,700
And I'd be watching you, like
a dingo watches a human baby.

126
00:08:30,701 --> 00:08:33,282
-Mmm.
-Okay, that sounded, Okay that
sounded a little weird.

127
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:34,485
A little bit, yeah.

128
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,968
And you're making a weird face,
and that's making me feel weird.

129
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43,009
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.

130
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:45,619
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying like I'm in love with you.

131
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,425
I'm saying...Roxanne?
Roxaroo?

132
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,711
Get back to work.

133
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:07,897
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

134
00:09:08,316 --> 00:09:09,665
-Freeze!
-Whoa, what are you doing, guys?

135
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,769
It's ME! It's the Warden.

136
00:09:12,435 --> 00:09:13,762
Hey, open up.

137
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:24,002
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.

138
00:09:24,003 --> 00:09:25,555
You were right.

139
00:09:27,043 --> 00:09:28,760
I'll always be a villain.

140
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:49,210
Well hello good looking, need a lift?

141
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,655
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.

142
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:53,545
Get in the car, you.

143
00:09:53,725 --> 00:09:55,321
Whoo, I'm free.

144
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,280
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.

145
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:00,502
You got it, boss.

146
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:02,254
Punch it.

147
00:10:03,203 --> 00:10:06,088
All right, put your hands in the air.

148
00:10:10,162 --> 00:10:13,696
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.

149
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,970
-Who's your Man?
-Metro man.

150
00:10:17,374 --> 00:10:20,164
Yeah, Metro City!

151
00:10:22,724 --> 00:10:26,029
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?

152
00:10:26,034 --> 00:10:27,929
Give it to me...all right!

153
00:10:30,022 --> 00:10:33,600
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.

154
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:47,029
Hey, Metro city.

155
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:49,890
Hello, hey.

156
00:10:51,269 --> 00:10:53,544
You know, I just want you to bring it down a bit.

157
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:54,917
Boys, a little lower.

158
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,320
Thank you fellows.

159
00:10:56,321 --> 00:10:58,753
Let's get real for a moment.

160
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:01,849
That's right, that's right
ha, ha, that's right.

161
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,440
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.

162
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:08,728
Super cool, you want to know what the
greatest honor you've given me is?

163
00:11:08,992 --> 00:11:10,406
Do you really want to know?

164
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:11,940
Really?

165
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:14,159
I'll tell you.

166
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:17,037
The greatest honor you've given me is...

167
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:18,878
...letting me serve you.

168
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:20,688
To help these people in Metro city.

169
00:11:20,935 --> 00:11:22,345
And at the end of every day.

170
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,839
Well.

171
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,682
I often ask myself.

172
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,877
Who would I be, without you?

173
00:11:29,878 --> 00:11:30,889
Man screams:
I love you Metro Man!

174
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,714
And I love you, random citizen.

175
00:11:40,628 --> 00:11:44,813
I tell you Minion, there's no
place like evil lair.

176
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:48,365
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.

177
00:11:49,223 --> 00:11:50,749
How do I look, Minion?

178
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:53,871
-Do I look bad?
-Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

179
00:11:53,872 --> 00:11:55,558
You always know what to say.

180
00:11:55,559 --> 00:11:57,826
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.

181
00:11:57,827 --> 00:12:00,459
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?

182
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:04,447
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.

183
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:08,581
-No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.
-Oh, look at that.

184
00:12:08,582 --> 00:12:10,122
Now, back to work.

185
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:22,449
She's awake,
Quick, to work.

186
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:37,022
-Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
-Would it kill you to wash the bag?

187
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:41,158
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

188
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,609
Wha..why isn't she screaming?

189
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,967
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.

190
00:12:46,968 --> 00:12:48,722
Like this...AHHHHH!

191
00:12:48,723 --> 00:12:50,425
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.

192
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,084
-AHHHHH!!!
-It's a little better.

193
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,660
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website,

194
00:12:58,661 --> 00:13:01,953
where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?

195
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:04,583
Actually most of it comes from an
outlet store in...

196
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:05,760
Don't answer that.

197
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,166
Romania.

198
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,268
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey
reporter skills,

199
00:13:11,269 --> 00:13:15,117
on your weak willed mind to find
out all our secrets.

200
00:13:16,266 --> 00:13:21,318
Such tricks...won't work...
on me.

201
00:13:21,319 --> 00:13:22,942
-Please talk slower
-Temptress.

202
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:26,175
What secrets? You're so predictable.

203
00:13:26,176 --> 00:13:28,371
Predictable, predictable?

204
00:13:28,372 --> 00:13:32,130
Oh, you call THIS predictable?

205
00:13:32,131 --> 00:13:34,270
Your Alligators, yes.

206
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,923
I was thinking about it on the way over.

207
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:39,434
What's this? BOOM!

208
00:13:39,435 --> 00:13:42,023
-In your face.
-Clich?

209
00:13:42,024 --> 00:13:43,056
No, look, watch.

210
00:13:43,914 --> 00:13:44,918
Juvenile.

211
00:13:44,919 --> 00:13:47,007
-Shuck it all!
-Tacky

212
00:13:47,008 --> 00:13:49,064
-Oh, so sorry.
-Seen it.

213
00:13:49,065 --> 00:13:50,918
-What's this one do?
-Garish.

214
00:13:52,016 --> 00:13:53,980
Roxanne: Okay, the spiders new.

215
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,443
Spider?

216
00:13:59,053 --> 00:14:00,237
Ee, Uh, yes!

217
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:06,182
The "spee..ider". Even the smallest bite
from arachnis deathicus

218
00:14:06,183 --> 00:14:08,583
Will instantly paralyze...OW!

219
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:09,899
Get it off!

220
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,548
Megamind: Ow!
-Give it up, Megamind. Your plans never work.

221
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:18,488
Let's stop wasting time and call your
boyfriend in tights, shall we?

222
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:21,216
OOOWWW!

223
00:14:21,217 --> 00:14:25,814
It is with great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.

224
00:14:25,815 --> 00:14:27,099
If you please.

225
00:14:35,068 --> 00:14:37,215
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.

226
00:14:59,457 --> 00:15:04,195
-Megamind.
-Oh, bravo Metro Man.

227
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:07,664
Booooo!

228
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:09,646
Yes, I can play along too.

229
00:15:09,647 --> 00:15:10,672
Booooo.

230
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:13,146
Should have known you'd try
to crash the party.

231
00:15:13,147 --> 00:15:15,291
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.

232
00:15:15,292 --> 00:15:21,101
This is the day you and Montrosity,
shall not soon forget.

233
00:15:21,102 --> 00:15:23,620
It's pronounced Metro City!

234
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,378
Oh, potato, tomato,
potato, tomato.

235
00:15:26,379 --> 00:15:27,725
We all know how this ends.

236
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,603
With you behind bars.

237
00:15:29,604 --> 00:15:33,719
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom
baby seal-leather boots.

238
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,837
You will leave, Montrosity.

239
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:38,624
Megamind: Or this will be the last
you ever hear of,

240
00:15:38,625 --> 00:15:40,593
Roxanne Ritchi!

241
00:15:40,594 --> 00:15:42,594
-Huh?
-Roxanne!

242
00:15:42,595 --> 00:15:45,905
-Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
-I'm not panicking.

243
00:15:45,906 --> 00:15:49,923
In order to stop me, You need to
find me first, Metro Man.

244
00:15:49,924 --> 00:15:51,506
We're at the abandoned observatory.

245
00:15:51,507 --> 00:15:53,745
-Ah ha.
-NO! No we're not!

246
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,869
Megamind: Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

247
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,411
Metro Man approaching, sir.

248
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:21,031
-HAH!
-Hah, hah!

249
00:16:21,034 --> 00:16:22,271
Hah, hah, hah.

250
00:16:38,679 --> 00:16:40,193
Hold on a second.

251
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,271
Megamind: Oh, good heavens.

252
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:53,756
You didn't think you were in the real
observatory, did you?

253
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:01,203
Ready the death ray, Minion.

254
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:02,852
Death ray, readying.

255
00:17:06,723 --> 00:17:08,264
Megamind: Over here, old friend.

256
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:09,538
Megamind: In case you haven't noticed,

257
00:17:09,539 --> 00:17:11,885
You've fallen right into my trap.

258
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:14,792
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.

259
00:17:14,798 --> 00:17:18,383
Even the most heartfelt belief,
can be corroded over time.

260
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:20,174
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.

261
00:17:20,177 --> 00:17:22,788
But metals can be melted by the
heat of 're-vange'.

262
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,918
It's 'revenge' and it's best
served cold.

263
00:17:24,921 --> 00:17:27,983
But it can be easily reheated, in the
microwave of evil.

264
00:17:27,988 --> 00:17:29,378
Well I think your warranty is about
to expire.

265
00:17:29,379 --> 00:17:31,207
Maybe I got an extended warranty?

266
00:17:31,212 --> 00:17:34,141
Warranties are invalid if you don't use
the product for its intended purpose.

267
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:37,376
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?

268
00:17:37,388 --> 00:17:43,830
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand
the full concentrated power of the...SUN!

269
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,794
FIRE!

270
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:57,259
Minion, fire...

271
00:17:57,262 --> 00:17:59,456
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.

272
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,902
-Come again?
-Warming up, sir.

273
00:18:00,906 --> 00:18:03,733
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?

274
00:18:03,737 --> 00:18:06,269
One...sssecond...more.

275
00:18:06,274 --> 00:18:08,587
aaannnd....jussst.

276
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:12,750
Minion: Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap,
tip top more.

277
00:18:12,756 --> 00:18:15,481
-Honestly.
-And we are ready, in just.

278
00:18:15,486 --> 00:18:17,696
Oh! I told you to have things ready.

279
00:18:17,697 --> 00:18:19,624
I told you countless times.

280
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:20,961
Why do you always blame me?

281
00:18:20,962 --> 00:18:23,442
My spider bite is acting.

282
00:18:23,446 --> 00:18:25,909
Your plan is failing,
just admit it.

283
00:18:25,914 --> 00:18:27,618
Yeah, good luck with that one.

284
00:18:27,619 --> 00:18:29,481
Whose side are you on?

285
00:18:29,482 --> 00:18:30,752
The losing side.

286
00:18:30,753 --> 00:18:33,636
-Thank you.
-Uh, could someone stamp my
frequent kidnapping card?

287
00:18:36,369 --> 00:18:40,425
You of all people, know we
discontinued that promotion.

288
00:18:40,558 --> 00:18:42,917
-Chow, chow all.
-Same time next week?

289
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,258
What did he just say?

290
00:18:49,268 --> 00:18:50,825
Crab nuggets?

291
00:18:55,192 --> 00:18:57,455
Good lord, I'm trapped.

292
00:18:57,459 --> 00:18:59,219
What kind of trickery is this?

293
00:18:59,226 --> 00:19:04,508
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.

294
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:05,788
It, it has?

295
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,966
This dome is obviously lined with copper.

296
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,599
-Yeah, so?
-Minion: Sir!

297
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,035
Metro Man: Copper drains my powers.

298
00:19:15,036 --> 00:19:17,261
Your weakness is copper?

299
00:19:17,262 --> 00:19:18,958
You're kidding, right?

300
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,988
I don't think even he could
survive that.

301
00:19:48,528 --> 00:19:52,232
Well, lets not get our hopes up
just yet.

302
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:54,581
-Look!
-Metro Man.

303
00:19:54,592 --> 00:19:57,130
Metro Man...

304
00:19:57,138 --> 00:19:58,924
Metro Man! AHHH!

305
00:20:06,858 --> 00:20:09,279
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!

306
00:20:10,481 --> 00:20:12,041
Megamind: Ewwww.

307
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:16,576
You did it, sir.

308
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:17,795
I did it?

309
00:20:21,079 --> 00:20:22,539
He did it.

310
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,956
Megamind: I did it.

311
00:20:23,959 --> 00:20:25,475
He did it.

312
00:20:25,477 --> 00:20:27,487
-You did it, sir.
-I did it!

313
00:20:27,491 --> 00:20:28,828
-You did it.
-I did it!

314
00:20:28,974 --> 00:20:31,823
Montrocity is mine!

315
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:37,378
Minion: You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.

316
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:41,449
Minion: All right people, hit it.

317
00:20:47,697 --> 00:20:48,994
Hit it!

318
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,148
Drop 'em

319
00:21:50,347 --> 00:21:52,465
First off, what a turnout.

320
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:54,672
How wild is this, huh?

321
00:21:56,351 --> 00:22:00,471
All I did was eliminate the most
powerful man in the universe.

322
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:01,875
Megamind: Are there any questions?

323
00:22:01,878 --> 00:22:04,506
Megamind: Come on..yes?
You in the back.

324
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:08,049
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan
to do with us.

325
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:09,530
And the city.

326
00:22:09,531 --> 00:22:11,081
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.

327
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:17,245
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying
evil thing you could possibly think of.

328
00:22:17,702 --> 00:22:21,324
And multiply it by...SIX!

329
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:28,668
Megamind:
In the mean time I want you to carry on,
with the dreary normal things you,

330
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:30,450
Normal people do.

331
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:32,680
Let's just have fun with this, come on.

332
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,274
And I will get back to you.

333
00:22:40,411 --> 00:22:42,232
Megamind:
Now slam the door, really hard.

334
00:22:42,259 --> 00:22:45,268
They can...they can still see you.

335
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:46,795
- Now?
- Yeah, you're still there.

336
00:22:46,797 --> 00:22:48,445
Let's get going.

337
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:57,981
Ahh, Minion.

338
00:22:57,982 --> 00:23:00,307
Did you think this day would ever come?

339
00:23:00,308 --> 00:23:05,303
No way, not at all, sir. Never,
never in a million, I mean...

340
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,190
Yes, I did.

341
00:23:07,193 --> 00:23:09,053
Look at the intricate moon links.

342
00:23:09,061 --> 00:23:11,392
I'm looking, I'm looking.

343
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:13,110
And what's this?

344
00:23:13,148 --> 00:23:16,707
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.

345
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,555
But it seems to only carry one station.

346
00:23:19,558 --> 00:23:22,808
Oh, that sir is called a window.

347
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,725
-Window...
-All the kids are looking through them.

348
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:29,307
Oooo, I've never had a view before.

349
00:23:29,678 --> 00:23:32,940
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.

350
00:23:32,946 --> 00:23:36,253
If my parents could see me now.

351
00:23:36,254 --> 00:23:40,211
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down
from evil heaven.

352
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:44,154
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out
of the way.

353
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,239
I  can have, everything I want!

354
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,815
And  there's no one to stop me.

355
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:39,666
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

356
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:43,153
I understand you,
little well dressed bird.

357
00:24:43,162 --> 00:24:50,639
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't
it. What's your vacuum like?

358
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,404
Hey, hey, hey! Not now, Minion.

359
00:24:59,081 --> 00:25:04,635
I'm in a heated existential discussion
with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.

360
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:10,215
I...is something wrong, sir?

361
00:25:11,063 --> 00:25:13,190
Just think about it.

362
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:15,048
We have it all.

363
00:25:16,459 --> 00:25:18,486
But we have nothing.

364
00:25:19,649 --> 00:25:21,977
It's just to easy now.

365
00:25:22,778 --> 00:25:24,982
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

366
00:25:25,715 --> 00:25:31,094
-I mean, we did it, right?
-Well, you did it, sir.

367
00:25:31,102 --> 00:25:33,457
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.

368
00:25:33,462 --> 00:25:38,456
-Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
-Huh?

369
00:25:38,464 --> 00:25:40,870
Unhappy.

370
00:25:40,871 --> 00:25:48,185
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow,
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

371
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:49,981
That always seems to lift your spirits.

372
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:56,602
Good idea, Minion. But without him,
what's the point?

373
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,732
-Minion: Him, sir?
-Nothing.

374
00:26:00,607 --> 00:26:03,775
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh,

375
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,545
something to consider and um,

376
00:26:05,554 --> 00:26:08,703
well, I think I'll just power
down for a while then.

377
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,636
Roxanne: He was always there for us.

378
00:26:17,946 --> 00:26:19,795
Roxanne: Dependable.

379
00:26:21,662 --> 00:26:23,117
Perhaps we took him for granted.

380
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:27,565
Maybe we never really know how good we
have it, until it's gone.

381
00:26:29,209 --> 00:26:30,808
We miss you, Metro Man.

382
00:26:30,811 --> 00:26:32,976
I, miss you.

383
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:36,446
Roxanne: And I have just one question for,
Megamind.

384
00:26:36,454 --> 00:26:38,396
Are you happy now?

385
00:26:41,422 --> 00:26:44,686
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a
city without a hero.

386
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:50,418
Roxanne: Coming up next. Are you ready to be a
slave army? What you need to know.

387
00:26:56,090 --> 00:27:00,879
Aaannd wrap that up and give it
to a child on Christmas.

388
00:27:00,886 --> 00:27:03,989
-'Cause we're done.
-Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.

389
00:27:03,994 --> 00:27:07,351
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party
at my house.

390
00:27:07,352 --> 00:27:09,520
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.

391
00:27:09,523 --> 00:27:13,553
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.

392
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:17,906
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really
fell like being around a bunch of people.

393
00:27:17,914 --> 00:27:20,056
No, no, no. That's the best part,
it'll  be like just you and me.

394
00:27:21,972 --> 00:27:25,726
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.

395
00:27:25,833 --> 00:27:27,646
-But,
-I did hire a wedding photographer.

396
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:30,560
That's just in case, we were like
something crazy happened.

397
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,410
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe
we should have this for like ever,

398
00:27:33,415 --> 00:27:34,865
like a memory, you know.

399
00:27:34,867 --> 00:27:36,837
Um, I'm gonna pass.

400
00:27:36,838 --> 00:27:39,963
I have some work here I need
to do. Okay, bye.

401
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:42,236
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?

402
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,406
-Goodnight, Hal.
-It's a soft yes, on Thursday.

403
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,777
What's, wrong with me?

404
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:52,246
Rented a bouncy house? Chick's don't like
bouncy houses, they like clown's.

405
00:27:54,885 --> 00:27:58,383
Hal: Stupid van!
Broke my finger!

406
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,426
I've made a horrible mistake.

407
00:28:37,097 --> 00:28:39,181
I didn't mean to destroy you.

408
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:41,875
I mean, I meant to destroy you.

409
00:28:42,282 --> 00:28:44,246
I didn't think it would really work.

410
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:51,173
What are we suppose to do? Without you,
evil is running rampant through the streets.

411
00:28:51,174 --> 00:28:54,778
I am so tired of running rampant
through the streets.

412
00:28:55,802 --> 00:28:59,267
What's the point of being bad when
there's no good to try and stop you?

413
00:29:00,214 --> 00:29:01,813
Someone has to stop, Megamind.

414
00:29:01,814 --> 00:29:03,094
Bernard: Hey, we're closing soon.

415
00:29:03,097 --> 00:29:04,303
Oh, you scared me.

416
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:06,107
-Barry, right?
-Bernard.

417
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:10,515
Bernard, I was just well I was
talking to myself.

418
00:29:10,522 --> 00:29:12,269
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.

419
00:29:12,274 --> 00:29:14,504
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.

420
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:15,345
Thank you, I just...

421
00:29:15,347 --> 00:29:17,097
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

422
00:29:18,815 --> 00:29:20,682
-Okay.
-Thanks.

423
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:24,390
I had so many evil plans in the works.

424
00:29:24,749 --> 00:29:26,388
The illiteracy beam.

425
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:28,567
Typhoon cheese.

426
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,217
Robo sheep.

427
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:33,258
Battles we will now, never have.

428
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:38,778
You know we never had the chance
to say goodbye.

429
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:42,140
So, it's good that we have this time now.

430
00:29:42,245 --> 00:29:44,798
You know, before I destroy the place.

431
00:29:44,804 --> 00:29:48,210
Nothing personal, it just brings back
to many painful memories.

432
00:29:52,394 --> 00:29:54,266
Hello, hello?

433
00:29:54,270 --> 00:29:55,301
Roxanne!

434
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:07,066
That's a pretty tasteless costume.

435
00:30:07,067 --> 00:30:11,789
-Costume?
-Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.

436
00:30:11,797 --> 00:30:16,579
Oh you even made a cheap replica of
his dehydration gun. How...

437
00:30:17,789 --> 00:30:19,510
Hello, is someone there?

438
00:30:22,311 --> 00:30:24,569
Hello, who's there?

439
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,640
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.

440
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:28,760
It's just you, Bernard.

441
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:31,513
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.

442
00:30:31,518 --> 00:30:34,161
Well thank you for letting me stay.

443
00:30:34,162 --> 00:30:37,112
Look I wouldn't stay for more than two minutes
and thirty seven seconds if I were you.

444
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:39,863
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.

445
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:42,165
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.

446
00:30:42,166 --> 00:30:45,154
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down
with you then.

447
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:55,071
I kept thinking he was going to do
one of his last minute escapes.

448
00:30:55,986 --> 00:30:58,924
Yeah, he was really good at those.

449
00:30:58,954 --> 00:31:01,687
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.

450
00:31:02,202 --> 00:31:04,548
I've looked into the reset button.

451
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:07,467
The size is impossible.

452
00:31:07,803 --> 00:31:13,217
Oh, Bernard, I didn't know you had...feelings.
Are you okay?

453
00:31:14,381 --> 00:31:19,120
Metro Man is gone. And now there's
no one left to challenge Megamind.

454
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:20,839
Come on, Bernard.

455
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,568
As long as there's evil good will
rise up against it.

456
00:31:23,574 --> 00:31:25,481
Ohhh, I wish.

457
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:28,555
I believe someone is going to stand
up to Megamind.

458
00:31:28,556 --> 00:31:29,593
-You really think so?
-Yeah.

459
00:31:29,594 --> 00:31:33,463
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.

460
00:31:35,904 --> 00:31:39,336
Heroes can be made. That's it!

461
00:31:39,863 --> 00:31:42,525
-All you need are the right ingredients.
-Yeah.

462
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:44,168
-Bravery.
-Yes.

463
00:31:44,171 --> 00:31:45,468
-Strength.
-Of course.

464
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,276
-Determination.
-Imperative.

465
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,235
And a smidgen of DNA.

466
00:31:49,244 --> 00:31:52,653
-With that, anyone can be a hero.
-Yeah!

467
00:31:52,654 --> 00:31:54,319
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

468
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:55,863
I think we should run.

469
00:31:56,595 --> 00:31:57,598
Bye.

470
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:00,942
Time to put the past behind us.

471
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:04,321
Only the future...AHH!

472
00:32:04,324 --> 00:32:07,640
Oh, I'm to close.
I'm genuinely scared right now.

473
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:10,074
Oh, I hope no ones seeing this.

474
00:32:10,141 --> 00:32:13,931
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what?
Why would you do that?

475
00:32:13,938 --> 00:32:15,644
So I have someone to fight.

476
00:32:15,647 --> 00:32:18,388
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

477
00:32:18,395 --> 00:32:20,419
A ying, with no yang.

478
00:32:20,422 --> 00:32:22,833
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.

479
00:32:22,838 --> 00:32:25,481
In other words, I have no purpose.

480
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,182
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.

481
00:32:28,183 --> 00:32:29,331
Go on, ask.

482
00:32:29,335 --> 00:32:30,834
How are you doing to do it?

483
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,329
I'm going to give someone, I don't know
who yet.

484
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:40,954
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that
someone to become Montrocity's new hero.

485
00:32:41,017 --> 00:32:42,682
Over here, follow.

486
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:47,909
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.

487
00:32:47,917 --> 00:32:50,839
We could put everything back the way it was.

488
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,289
When the world was perfect.

489
00:32:53,311 --> 00:32:55,724
And rosy. Behold, Minion.

490
00:32:55,742 --> 00:32:57,845
Metro Man's cape.

491
00:32:57,846 --> 00:32:58,858
Look closely.

492
00:32:58,866 --> 00:33:00,504
Tell me what you see?

493
00:33:00,507 --> 00:33:01,519
Dandruff?

494
00:33:01,692 --> 00:33:04,254
Yes, it's his DNA.

495
00:33:04,263 --> 00:33:09,201
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.

496
00:33:11,774 --> 00:33:14,179
Minion: Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

497
00:33:14,184 --> 00:33:19,346
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.

498
00:33:19,354 --> 00:33:22,018
But I'm saying this is a kind of
bad, bad.

499
00:33:22,022 --> 00:33:24,950
Okay, you might think it's good
in your bad perception.

500
00:33:24,951 --> 00:33:28,399
But from a good perception,
it is just plain bad.

501
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:30,740
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.

502
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,205
Now we have just one shot at this.

503
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,447
We must find a suitable subject.

504
00:33:36,453 --> 00:33:43,373
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

505
00:33:43,865 --> 00:33:47,470
What on earth is that?

506
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:50,636
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.

507
00:33:53,426 --> 00:33:56,031
-O-llo,
-Uh, it's hello.

508
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:57,729
Hello, like that?

509
00:33:57,732 --> 00:34:00,038
-Bernard, it's Roxanne.
-It's Roxanne.

510
00:34:00,043 --> 00:34:02,450
Roxanne: I just want to thank you for
inspiring me the other day.

511
00:34:02,453 --> 00:34:04,788
-Oh, You've inspired me too.
-Great!

512
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:08,608
Roxanne: It's time we stood up to Megamind
and show him he can't push us around.

513
00:34:08,614 --> 00:34:11,230
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.

514
00:34:11,234 --> 00:34:13,202
-I'm already hot on his trail.
-Uh, huh.

515
00:34:13,206 --> 00:34:15,380
And what gives you that idea?

516
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,807
-Uh, sir.
-I just found his secret hideout.

517
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,323
How did she find my hideout?

518
00:34:19,325 --> 00:34:22,550
Uh, how did you find his hideout?

519
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:27,215
This is the only building in Metro City
with a big observatory on the roof.

520
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:32,854
Okay, there's no way she'll find
the secret entrance.

521
00:34:32,859 --> 00:34:35,492
Oh! There's a doormat here that
say's 'Secret Entrance'.

522
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,564
-Minion!
-I kept forgetting where it was.

523
00:34:39,568 --> 00:34:41,169
She'll discover all our secrets.

524
00:34:41,174 --> 00:34:44,363
-Ohh, oh no!
-You dim-witted creation of science.

525
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:46,354
- What?
- Oh, not you Roxanne.

526
00:34:46,358 --> 00:34:48,689
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.

527
00:34:48,694 --> 00:34:50,460
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.

528
00:34:51,311 --> 00:34:52,464
Hal: Roxanne?

529
00:34:52,492 --> 00:34:54,636
Oh no, not again.

530
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:02,221
Mega-Bernard: Roxanne.

531
00:35:02,224 --> 00:35:04,601
Oh, I'm glad you're here.

532
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,313
Wait, how did you get here so fast?

533
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,360
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking
nearby when you called.

534
00:35:10,367 --> 00:35:11,612
-In a suit?
-Uh huh.

535
00:35:11,615 --> 00:35:13,943
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.

536
00:35:13,947 --> 00:35:15,442
But that's not important.

537
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:16,565
I better take the lead.

538
00:35:16,568 --> 00:35:17,707
This way looks exciting.

539
00:35:17,709 --> 00:35:18,480
No, it says, exit.

540
00:35:18,481 --> 00:35:21,752
Uh, which is the abbreviation
for 'Exciting', right?

541
00:35:21,753 --> 00:35:24,255
Roxanne: It's the mother load.

542
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,581
-Ahh.
-Wow.

543
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:27,253
-Wow.
-Just look at this thing.

544
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:29,929
You know, I really could use your help in
deciphering all this.

545
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:33,053
-Really?
-You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?

546
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:37,541
-Yes, right.
-Together we could figure out his plan
for the city and stop it.

547
00:35:38,314 --> 00:35:39,598
Are you in?

548
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,925
- Oh, what fun!
- That's what I want to hear.

549
00:35:42,001 --> 00:35:44,037
Minion, Code-Send in the brain bots.

550
00:35:44,038 --> 00:35:46,471
You know the whole point of a code is...

551
00:35:46,472 --> 00:35:48,495
Oh code-just do it, Minion.

552
00:35:51,731 --> 00:35:53,719
Ahh, it's me you fools!

553
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,830
Bernard!

554
00:35:56,553 --> 00:35:57,839
It's daddy.

555
00:36:00,919 --> 00:36:02,257
Megamind!

556
00:36:02,526 --> 00:36:03,391
What have you done with, Bernard?

557
00:36:03,392 --> 00:36:07,653
Oh Bernard? Oh yes, I'm doing
horrible things to that man.

558
00:36:07,659 --> 00:36:09,925
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.

559
00:36:09,926 --> 00:36:12,943
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!

560
00:36:12,944 --> 00:36:14,472
You know the drill.

561
00:36:14,473 --> 00:36:16,293
Oh no, not the drill.

562
00:36:17,294 --> 00:36:19,150
-Let him go.
-Or what?

563
00:36:19,155 --> 00:36:21,841
Or I'm going to find out what this
weird looking gun does.

564
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,438
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.

565
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,058
I'll just go get him.

566
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:28,009
Unhand me you fiend!

567
00:36:28,114 --> 00:36:30,826
It, its strength's to much.

568
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:33,028
Oh, I work out.

569
00:36:33,032 --> 00:36:38,112
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.

570
00:36:41,692 --> 00:36:42,726
Are you okay?

571
00:36:42,727 --> 00:36:45,568
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.

572
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,008
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.

573
00:36:48,009 --> 00:36:49,075
I got this covered.

574
00:36:52,246 --> 00:36:53,740
Let go, it's mine!

575
00:36:53,374 --> 00:36:54,824
Bernard, run!

576
00:36:57,541 --> 00:36:58,543
Give it to me.

577
00:36:58,875 --> 00:36:59,878
Oh no!

578
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:06,576
Roxanne.

579
00:37:08,317 --> 00:37:09,319
Hal: Ow!

580
00:37:12,875 --> 00:37:14,136
Who on earth is that?

581
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:25,329
Mega-Bernard: Roxanne!

582
00:37:26,681 --> 00:37:29,552
Bernard, you were right about that door
being exciting.

583
00:37:30,091 --> 00:37:31,095
This way.

584
00:37:36,165 --> 00:37:37,958
What are you doing?

585
00:37:37,959 --> 00:37:39,795
This will stop them, here!

586
00:37:39,796 --> 00:37:41,789
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.

587
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:44,697
Just throw it.

588
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:46,481
Daddy's, sorry.

589
00:37:57,263 --> 00:38:00,187
-Wow, that was real exciting.
-Yeah.

590
00:38:00,188 --> 00:38:01,894
-You were very strong in there.
-I know.

591
00:38:01,895 --> 00:38:04,828
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man
stand up to him like that.

592
00:38:04,829 --> 00:38:05,988
What's going on?

593
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,254
Hal, what happened?

594
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:08,665
I think a bee flew up my nose.

595
00:38:08,863 --> 00:38:11,867
I was just about to make my frontal
assault to rescue you,

596
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:13,855
but like fifty ninjas started to attack me.

597
00:38:13,856 --> 00:38:16,814
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...

598
00:38:16,815 --> 00:38:18,123
-and they were all like crying, and stuff.
-Wow.

599
00:38:18,124 --> 00:38:19,816
Brave one, isn't he.

600
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,969
Who are you?

601
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,667
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.

602
00:38:22,668 --> 00:38:24,277
-He's my partner.
-Partner?

603
00:38:24,818 --> 00:38:26,142
Yes, yes partner.

604
00:38:26,143 --> 00:38:28,607
Well look partner, I'm her partner.

605
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:31,914
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's
been through a traumatic experience.

606
00:38:31,915 --> 00:38:34,047
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.

607
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:43,505
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

608
00:38:44,185 --> 00:38:45,487
Yeah, okay.

609
00:38:45,729 --> 00:38:46,502
I'd like that.

610
00:38:46,503 --> 00:38:49,799
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you
accidentally, hugged him instead of me.

611
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:51,098
Minion: Sir!

612
00:38:51,439 --> 00:38:52,439
Minion: SIR!

613
00:38:52,529 --> 00:38:54,937
Minion whispers: Code-Did you find out
who it was?

614
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,184
Huh?
Oh, oh.

615
00:38:58,142 --> 00:38:59,714
Code-get the car.

616
00:38:59,715 --> 00:39:01,205
Code-right away, sir.

617
00:39:09,632 --> 00:39:11,406
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow, Hal.

618
00:39:11,407 --> 00:39:13,809
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
you want to check on me later.

619
00:39:15,695 --> 00:39:20,131
Megamind: Who is this man,
we've infused with godlike power?

620
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:23,575
Ow, ow, whoa ho.

621
00:39:23,576 --> 00:39:26,498
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.

622
00:39:26,499 --> 00:39:28,168
No criminal record.

623
00:39:28,169 --> 00:39:29,504
Actually, no records at all.

624
00:39:29,505 --> 00:39:31,853
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.

625
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,403
Not yet, Minion.
Not...

626
00:39:35,254 --> 00:39:36,270
...Yet.

627
00:39:36,271 --> 00:39:39,047
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?

628
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:41,174
So I will just go ahead and defuse him,

629
00:39:41,177 --> 00:39:44,593
since this is clearly a mistake.

630
00:39:44,599 --> 00:39:47,313
No, Minion. Something much
more powerful at work.

631
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,361
This is no mistake.

632
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,085
It's destiny.

633
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:56,524
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.

634
00:39:56,525 --> 00:40:00,218
Hal? Hal Stewart?

635
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:01,234
Am I saying it right?

636
00:40:01,235 --> 00:40:02,546
-Stewart.
-Aaah.

637
00:40:03,556 --> 00:40:07,114
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across
the hall has way better stuff than me.

638
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,256
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.

639
00:40:09,257 --> 00:40:10,319
Quick, the spray.

640
00:40:11,544 --> 00:40:14,608
-Oops, all out.
-Well use the forget-me-stick.

641
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:15,624
Oh, right!

642
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,303
Just look at him.

643
00:40:20,713 --> 00:40:24,369
Minion: Well, he doesn't look quite the
hero type to me.

644
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,751
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

645
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:29,416
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.

646
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:31,941
I smell hero.

647
00:40:31,942 --> 00:40:34,297
I smell something burning.

648
00:40:34,298 --> 00:40:35,265
I think it's working!

649
00:40:35,266 --> 00:40:38,400
Places, places,
places, places...

650
00:40:39,141 --> 00:40:40,405
You have your disguise?

651
00:40:46,865 --> 00:40:48,065
What?

652
00:40:48,066 --> 00:40:50,084
Ah, you look fantastic.

653
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:02,571
Rise, my glorious creation.

654
00:41:02,572 --> 00:41:05,291
Rise, and come to Papa.

655
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:06,860
What's going on?

656
00:41:07,005 --> 00:41:09,662
-Easy my child.
-Who are you?

657
00:41:09,663 --> 00:41:13,031
I sent  you to this planet to
teach  you about justice.

658
00:41:13,032 --> 00:41:15,396
Megamind:
Honor, and nobility.

659
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,708
I am your father.

660
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:20,752
So you're like, my space Dad?

661
00:41:21,321 --> 00:41:24,107
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.

662
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:26,846
And you are, what?

663
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:30,029
I'm your space, Step-Mom.

664
00:41:31,036 --> 00:41:32,918
I, I had some work done recently.

665
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,873
Is this some kind of dream?

666
00:41:34,878 --> 00:41:37,052
This is a dream come true.

667
00:41:37,053 --> 00:41:40,445
You've been blethed
with unfathomamble power.

668
00:41:40,446 --> 00:41:41,521
What kind of power?

669
00:41:41,523 --> 00:41:42,690
Unfathamomble.

670
00:41:42,696 --> 00:41:45,267
It's un, without Fathom.

671
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:48,803
-Whoa
-Yeah, we've come to guide you.

672
00:41:48,809 --> 00:41:52,300
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.

673
00:41:52,315 --> 00:41:56,488
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.

674
00:41:59,732 --> 00:42:01,853
I know this is a lot to take in.

675
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:04,393
It may take months for you
to come to grips..

676
00:42:04,394 --> 00:42:05,631
No frickin' way.

677
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:07,363
I wasn't finished.

678
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:13,057
Wahoo! I'm going to be a hero.

679
00:42:13,168 --> 00:42:16,113
I'm going to be a hero.

680
00:42:16,114 --> 00:42:20,535
Thee Minion, he's perfect.

681
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:22,955
Aaannd, action!

682
00:42:22,956 --> 00:42:25,367
- Someone help me.
- I'm okay.

683
00:42:32,749 --> 00:42:34,513
Zap, zap, zap.

684
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,439
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay thomething cool back at me.

685
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,207
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.

686
00:42:45,208 --> 00:42:48,879
No, no, no. Slow it down, and stop.

687
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,419
I said slow down.

688
00:42:50,571 --> 00:42:51,797
Watch out.

689
00:42:55,803 --> 00:42:58,373
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!

690
00:42:58,454 --> 00:43:01,081
-Maybe we should change tactics?
-You think so?

691
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:04,458
Oh, you know how boys are.
They love video games.

692
00:43:04,463 --> 00:43:06,632
I can throw a few parts together.

693
00:43:06,637 --> 00:43:10,244
Can't...wait.
LoL,  smiley face.

694
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:11,753
Can't wait for what, sir?

695
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,884
Oh, that was such a funny story.

696
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,701
And brilliantly told, by the way.

697
00:43:17,702 --> 00:43:19,724
Okay, now you tell one.

698
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,035
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.

699
00:43:22,043 --> 00:43:24,733
And, I never heard you laugh before.

700
00:43:24,739 --> 00:43:26,270
Yeah, it's been a while.

701
00:43:26,974 --> 00:43:28,190
Feels pretty good.

702
00:43:33,123 --> 00:43:34,733
And, exit.

703
00:43:46,769 --> 00:43:48,032
You  don't get out much, do you?

704
00:43:48,033 --> 00:43:49,810
Fun!

705
00:43:51,104 --> 00:43:53,385
I used to come here with my mother
when I was a kid.

706
00:43:54,109 --> 00:43:56,087
It was one of my favorite things to do.

707
00:43:56,926 --> 00:43:58,182
Now look at it.

708
00:43:58,183 --> 00:43:59,338
It's a dump.

709
00:44:04,246 --> 00:44:06,038
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?

710
00:44:06,039 --> 00:44:11,108
Um, well we don't want to battle our
new hero in a dump, now...do we?

711
00:44:15,095 --> 00:44:16,634
They're all back.

712
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,237
But how, why?

713
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,680
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

714
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,358
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.

715
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:32,604
Wa haoooo

716
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:40,133
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I,
were never a couple.

717
00:44:40,134 --> 00:44:41,515
But I thought you two were...

718
00:44:41,517 --> 00:44:44,914
I know, everybody did. It's just,
well he was never really my type.

719
00:44:44,921 --> 00:44:46,167
Really?

720
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,757
Okay, now you tell me something.

721
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:51,623
Something you've never told anyone.

722
00:44:52,376 --> 00:44:56,258
Well, in shh-school.

723
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:59,833
None of the other kids really liked me.

724
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,352
I was always last one picked
for everything.

725
00:45:04,607 --> 00:45:07,564
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't
go to the same school.

726
00:45:12,786 --> 00:45:15,994
Hal, I think  you're ready for this.

727
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,936
Do I have a son?

728
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:22,682
No, Hal, you make me laugh.

729
00:45:22,687 --> 00:45:24,844
It stretches, it's for you.

730
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:28,029
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?

731
00:45:28,032 --> 00:45:29,195
Titan.

732
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:31,737
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?

733
00:45:31,749 --> 00:45:34,245
It was the only name I
could trademark.

734
00:45:35,303 --> 00:45:36,385
Oh.

735
00:45:36,386 --> 00:45:39,317
Do you have someone special
in your life, Hal?

736
00:45:39,372 --> 00:45:41,599
No not yet, but.

737
00:45:41,603 --> 00:45:46,203
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.

738
00:45:50,067 --> 00:45:54,670
That's very good. Romance is
very inspiring.

739
00:45:54,696 --> 00:45:58,842
-That's what I hear.
-All you have to do, is save her.

740
00:45:58,849 --> 00:46:00,675
Mega-space dad: And she'll be yours.

741
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:02,498
-Who want's Churro's?
-I do!

742
00:46:04,308 --> 00:46:06,185
Hal: Thanks spaced out, momma.

743
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:08,612
Mega-Space dad: On the count of three,
unsheathe your Churro.

744
00:46:08,616 --> 00:46:11,572
All together: One, two, three!
To Titan.

745
00:46:11,587 --> 00:46:14,493
Mega-space dad: Tomorrow,
you will fight Megamind.

746
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:17,085
Mega-space dad: And the city will know your name.

747
00:46:19,084 --> 00:46:21,688
The City's parks' restored to their
original glory.

748
00:46:21,692 --> 00:46:23,946
The street's, the safest they've been.

749
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,355
The banks reopened.

750
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,613
Has something happened to Megamind?

751
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:30,336
Has someone tamed this monster?

752
00:46:30,338 --> 00:46:35,901
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic,
and pleasantly confused.

753
00:46:35,947 --> 00:46:38,598
Well you seem in a very good
mood tonight, sir.

754
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:41,945
Huh? Oh yes, how long is this going to take?

755
00:46:42,098 --> 00:46:46,666
Just a few alterations, sir. And I will be
done with your most terrifying cape yet.

756
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:51,586
I'm calling it, The Black
Mambaaaaaaa...aaaa...aaa.

757
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:57,388
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am
running late. I have to go.

758
00:46:57,389 --> 00:46:59,243
What, where, where are  you going, sir?

759
00:46:59,244 --> 00:47:01,992
We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning.

760
00:47:01,993 --> 00:47:04,317
We haven't even tested your
big battle suit yet.

761
00:47:04,318 --> 00:47:05,786
You attend to the details, Minion.

762
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:08,097
I have to, run a quick errand.

763
00:47:08,098 --> 00:47:09,814
You don't run errands.

764
00:47:10,120 --> 00:47:11,276
What's going on here?

765
00:47:11,277 --> 00:47:13,462
-What?
-Oh, wait a minute.

766
00:47:14,308 --> 00:47:18,327
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
For Him?

767
00:47:18,328 --> 00:47:19,575
It's just my natural musk.

768
00:47:19,576 --> 00:47:21,529
Now, where are the car keys?

769
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:22,623
Ahhh.

770
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:26,114
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.

771
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:27,879
Your going on a date with her.

772
00:47:27,882 --> 00:47:32,589
No my main man, get out of town.

773
00:47:32,598 --> 00:47:36,073
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.

774
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:38,483
You are forgetting your place, Minion.

775
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,118
Now give me the keys.

776
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:44,929
What happens when Roxanne finds
out who you really are?

777
00:47:44,935 --> 00:47:46,709
She will never find out.

778
00:47:46,713 --> 00:47:48,768
That's the point of lying.

779
00:47:48,769 --> 00:47:50,694
Ahhh!

780
00:47:50,695 --> 00:47:54,657
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think
this was your first day of being evil.

781
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:55,915
NO!

782
00:47:56,883 --> 00:47:59,002
This has gone far enough.

783
00:48:00,086 --> 00:48:02,530
Oh, that was really grown up.

784
00:48:04,717 --> 00:48:06,873
Sir please, it's for your own good.

785
00:48:07,055 --> 00:48:08,409
Well what do you know.

786
00:48:08,412 --> 00:48:10,595
I may not know much, but I do know this.

787
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:13,759
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

788
00:48:13,764 --> 00:48:16,529
Maybe I don't want to be the bad
guy anymore.

789
00:48:20,061 --> 00:48:21,591
You heard me.

790
00:48:21,592 --> 00:48:23,424
Who are you?

791
00:48:24,017 --> 00:48:27,004
-Now give me the keys.
-NO! 

792
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:30,297
My soul purpose in life is
to look after you.

793
00:48:30,303 --> 00:48:32,317
Well I don't need you to look after me.

794
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,552
What are you...what are you saying?

795
00:48:34,555 --> 00:48:37,373
-You don't need me?
-Let me make it clear.

796
00:48:37,378 --> 00:48:39,706
Code-I don't need you.

797
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:41,518
You know what, you know what.

798
00:48:44,245 --> 00:48:47,068
Code-I'll just pack my thing and go.

799
00:48:47,069 --> 00:48:48,230
Code-Fine!

800
00:48:48,231 --> 00:48:49,853
Code-Fine back.

801
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:55,058
Well good luck on your date.

802
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:57,906
-I will.
-That doesn't even make any sense.

803
00:48:57,907 --> 00:48:58,856
I know.

804
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:33,363
I know I am so close, I can feel it.

805
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,631
Okay, okay I just have to take
a step back.

806
00:49:45,595 --> 00:49:46,880
Wait a minute.

807
00:49:59,175 --> 00:50:01,109
Roxanne: Titan.

808
00:50:01,110 --> 00:50:03,011
What's a Titan?

809
00:50:03,012 --> 00:50:06,225
My super ears are burning.

810
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,755
I usually just hear criminals. You
haven't been naughty, have you?

811
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:13,970
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing
with you.

812
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:15,093
The names Titan.

813
00:50:15,995 --> 00:50:19,503
-Titan?
-Your very own heroic  guardian
of pure awesome.

814
00:50:19,504 --> 00:50:21,603
What's your name? Just kidding, I know
everything about you.

815
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,761
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,

816
00:50:24,762 --> 00:50:28,235
Didn't know what you liked, so I
just grabbed  you know, all of them.

817
00:50:30,070 --> 00:50:33,002
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.

818
00:50:33,003 --> 00:50:36,297
-What do you want?
-Thought maybe we could go for a little
flight around town.

819
00:50:36,298 --> 00:50:38,027
-Get to know each other first.
-WHOA!

820
00:50:39,074 --> 00:50:40,918
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.

821
00:50:40,919 --> 00:50:42,114
Just what do you think you're doing?

822
00:50:42,115 --> 00:50:43,283
Oh are I moving to fast?

823
00:50:43,284 --> 00:50:47,469
You're probably right. I should just
rescue you a few times before we get
all romantic.

824
00:50:47,470 --> 00:50:48,779
Whoops!

825
00:50:49,145 --> 00:50:52,831
Saved you. You are lucky to
have such a great hero here.

826
00:50:52,832 --> 00:50:55,376
Oh no. Somebody do something?

827
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:57,853
Oh, right, right. Duh! I gotcha.

828
00:51:03,889 --> 00:51:07,277
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.

829
00:51:07,278 --> 00:51:08,830
-Aaaah, building!
-AH!

830
00:51:13,216 --> 00:51:14,318
Gotcha!

831
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:16,935
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

832
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:19,290
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of me saving your life.

833
00:51:19,291 --> 00:51:20,917
Put me down, right now!

834
00:51:20,918 --> 00:51:23,456
Okay, all right, all right,
hold on.

835
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:27,412
Are you crazy?

836
00:51:27,414 --> 00:51:31,098
I suppose I'm, a little crazy...
about you.

837
00:51:31,099 --> 00:51:32,768
Who are you? Really.

838
00:51:32,781 --> 00:51:37,776
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare
to have your mind blown, little lady.

839
00:51:38,942 --> 00:51:41,136
-Tada!
-Hal?

840
00:51:41,137 --> 00:51:43,505
Yeah, isn't this great?

841
00:51:43,506 --> 00:51:45,676
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

842
00:51:45,677 --> 00:51:47,590
No, it's not great.

843
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:51,964
Wow, our first fight. This is so us,
we're like an old married couple.

844
00:51:51,965 --> 00:51:55,117
There is no us, okay. There will
never be an us.

845
00:51:55,118 --> 00:51:57,591
But, I have powers.

846
00:51:57,592 --> 00:52:00,382
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.

847
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,153
You are a good guy, Hal.

848
00:52:01,154 --> 00:52:04,446
But you don't understand we need to
find out why...

849
00:52:04,447 --> 00:52:06,430
-Right now,
-This isn't right.

850
00:52:06,435 --> 00:52:08,713
-Listen to me, Hal.
-You're suppose to be with me.

851
00:52:08,714 --> 00:52:10,850
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

852
00:52:10,851 --> 00:52:14,691
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.

853
00:52:37,668 --> 00:52:39,677
-Bernard.
-Roxanne.

854
00:52:39,681 --> 00:52:43,353
-Sorry I'm late.
-Wow, your hair looks exciting.

855
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:46,506
Hmm, not the only exciting development
of the night.

856
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:48,967
Megamind's created a new hero.

857
00:52:48,968 --> 00:52:50,301
And I know why.

858
00:52:51,352 --> 00:52:52,898
It all makes sense now.

859
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:57,458
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created
a new hero to kick it for him.

860
00:52:57,809 --> 00:53:00,216
But why did he pick, Hal?

861
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:03,350
Hal is the worst possible person
you could pick.

862
00:53:03,357 --> 00:53:05,709
Wow, that's a lot to take in.

863
00:53:05,713 --> 00:53:07,540
It, it boggles my mind.

864
00:53:07,544 --> 00:53:09,546
I am extremely boggled.

865
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:12,904
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom
of who's kicking who's butt.

866
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:13,912
But in the mean time.

867
00:53:14,826 --> 00:53:17,232
Let's enjoy each other's company.

868
00:53:17,237 --> 00:53:20,475
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right,

869
00:53:20,479 --> 00:53:23,414
you know, I could use a breather.

870
00:53:23,424 --> 00:53:29,214
To, Bernard. For being the only normal
thing in my crazy upside down world.

871
00:53:29,224 --> 00:53:32,521
To...being normal.

872
00:53:42,821 --> 00:53:44,912
-Roxanne.
-Yes?

873
00:53:46,073 --> 00:53:48,113
Say I wasn't so normal.

874
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:54,899
Say I was bald and had the complexion
of a popular primary color.

875
00:53:54,927 --> 00:53:57,935
As a random, non specific example.

876
00:53:58,703 --> 00:54:00,562
Would you still enjoy my company?

877
00:54:00,563 --> 00:54:03,398
Of course, you don't judge a book by
its cover.

878
00:54:03,403 --> 00:54:05,027
Or a person from the outside.

879
00:54:05,030 --> 00:54:06,934
Oh, that's a relief to hear.

880
00:54:06,938 --> 00:54:08,712
You judge them based on their actions.

881
00:54:09,421 --> 00:54:11,991
Well that seems kinda petty,
don't you think.

882
00:54:40,553 --> 00:54:43,390
-You.
-What, what?

883
00:54:43,954 --> 00:54:46,281
Oh, don't look at me!

884
00:54:46,285 --> 00:54:48,102
Just, just a technical glitch.

885
00:54:48,207 --> 00:54:49,473
Don't look yet.

886
00:54:49,802 --> 00:54:51,651
My bad.

887
00:54:54,842 --> 00:54:56,422
Where were we?

888
00:54:59,007 --> 00:55:00,754
Now, now, hold on.

889
00:55:00,758 --> 00:55:01,349
YOU!

890
00:55:21,546 --> 00:55:24,180
I can explain.

891
00:55:25,966 --> 00:55:27,951
What about everything you just said?

892
00:55:27,954 --> 00:55:30,255
About judging a book by it's cover.

893
00:55:30,259 --> 00:55:33,603
Well let's take a look at the contents
then, shall we?

894
00:55:33,604 --> 00:55:35,038
You destroyed Metro Man.

895
00:55:35,042 --> 00:55:40,392
You took over the city and then you
actually got me to care about you.

896
00:55:41,556 --> 00:55:44,292
Why are you so evil?

897
00:55:44,293 --> 00:55:45,715
Tricking me?

898
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:48,786
What could you possibly hope to gain?

899
00:55:53,866 --> 00:55:54,886
Wait a minute.

900
00:55:54,887 --> 00:55:57,685
Oh, I don't believe this.

901
00:56:01,031 --> 00:56:04,619
Do you really think that I would
ever be with you?

902
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:08,072
no...

903
00:56:40,716 --> 00:56:43,836
Okay Minion, you were right.

904
00:56:43,846 --> 00:56:46,844
I was....less right.

905
00:56:47,149 --> 00:56:49,436
We should stick to what we're good at.

906
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,329
Being bad.

907
00:56:52,627 --> 00:56:53,639
Minion...

908
00:57:13,072 --> 00:57:14,075
You there.

909
00:57:15,163 --> 00:57:16,167
Yeah, you.

910
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:20,346
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!

911
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:56,823
Okay, Titan it's time to go down,
in style.

912
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:21,660
I hear there's a new hero.

913
00:58:21,661 --> 00:58:24,096
who dares to challenge my evil.

914
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,346
Where is the one they call, Titan?

915
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,596
Challenge me, if you dare.

916
00:58:56,415 --> 00:58:57,863
Megamind playfully cries:
Oh no, we're gonna crash.

917
00:59:01,327 --> 00:59:03,932
This is embarrassing.

918
00:59:10,436 --> 00:59:12,620
Ballsy and incipient.

919
00:59:12,623 --> 00:59:16,417
Boneheaded, irresponsible.

920
00:59:16,688 --> 00:59:17,691
 RUDE!

921
00:59:17,694 --> 00:59:20,272
Unprofessional, that's what this is.

922
00:59:20,279 --> 00:59:23,786
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

923
00:59:23,787 --> 00:59:25,865
Of course not, he was a pro.

924
00:59:25,870 --> 00:59:28,709
Hey, Megamind. You're actually
the guy I want to see.

925
00:59:28,715 --> 00:59:30,396
Also, there's a door here.

926
00:59:30,399 --> 00:59:34,640
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?

927
00:59:34,647 --> 00:59:36,171
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.

928
00:59:36,174 --> 00:59:38,876
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying
to beat this level.

929
00:59:38,881 --> 00:59:41,090
Were you even planning on showing up?

930
00:59:41,094 --> 00:59:42,731
What's this?

931
00:59:44,948 --> 00:59:47,276
Where did you get all this stuff?

932
00:59:47,281 --> 00:59:49,107
It doesn't belong to me.

933
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,592
You stole it!

934
00:59:50,594 --> 00:59:53,074
-Pretty cool, right.
-Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.

935
00:59:53,075 --> 00:59:54,676
Being a hero is for losers.

936
00:59:54,677 --> 00:59:57,466
It's work, work, work twenty four seven,
and for what?

937
00:59:57,471 --> 01:00:02,808
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns
out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

938
01:00:03,056 --> 01:00:04,474
Roxanne Ritchi?

939
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:05,679
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.

940
01:00:05,682 --> 01:00:10,161
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes
at some intellectual dweeb.

941
01:00:10,168 --> 01:00:12,453
Who needs all that noise.

942
01:00:12,457 --> 01:00:15,919
That's why I think, WE should
team up.

943
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,568
You? Wait! What?

944
01:00:17,571 --> 01:00:20,044
With my power, and your big
headedness,

945
01:00:20,045 --> 01:00:21,870
we could rule the city.

946
01:00:21,871 --> 01:00:24,543
-You want to team up?
-I even drew up some new costume designs.

947
01:00:24,547 --> 01:00:25,883
-See
-Costume design?

948
01:00:25,886 --> 01:00:29,564
You be the brain so you get a little brain
wearing glasses on your costume, or something.

949
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:34,025
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like
two tanks sword fighting.

950
01:00:34,413 --> 01:00:36,229
I can't believe you.

951
01:00:36,232 --> 01:00:43,618
All your gifts all your powers, and you
squander them for your own personal gain.

952
01:00:43,630 --> 01:00:45,249
-Yes!
-NO!

953
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:50,322
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.

954
01:00:50,323 --> 01:00:52,250
That's why I created you.

955
01:00:52,254 --> 01:00:54,880
Yeah, right. You're nuts.

956
01:00:54,881 --> 01:00:58,425
-Space Dad told me.
-Look, I'm your Space Dad.

957
01:00:59,884 --> 01:01:02,193
You should be more like Metro Man.

958
01:01:03,399 --> 01:01:04,458
You tricked me?

959
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,350
Oh, don't like that, huh?

960
01:01:06,354 --> 01:01:07,457
Well there's more.

961
01:01:08,989 --> 01:01:12,773
I'm also the intellectual dweeb
dating Roxanne.

962
01:01:13,196 --> 01:01:16,817
-No.
-And we were smooching up a storm.

963
01:01:16,818 --> 01:01:19,797
Mmmore...Mmmore...Mmmore.

964
01:01:19,798 --> 01:01:21,338
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna,...

965
01:01:21,339 --> 01:01:23,461
YES! Yes I know.

966
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:27,288
Bring me to justice. Oh god,
how I missed this.

967
01:01:30,592 --> 01:01:32,919
And the hero strikes the first blow.

968
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:35,142
But evil returns with a backhand.

969
01:01:39,939 --> 01:01:40,942
YES!

970
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:48,129
Ahh...shhhh.

971
01:01:49,723 --> 01:01:51,894
Come out you little freak!

972
01:01:51,895 --> 01:01:54,502
I want to see what that big brain
looks like on the pavement.

973
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:04,096
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.

974
01:02:05,125 --> 01:02:06,591
You little blue, twerp.

975
01:02:09,164 --> 01:02:10,994
En Garde!

976
01:02:15,590 --> 01:02:17,770
Oh, now that's the spirit.

977
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:20,562
Take, that, parry again!

978
01:02:20,563 --> 01:02:23,601
Now it's time for some witty back
and forth banter.

979
01:02:23,602 --> 01:02:26,116
You go first.

980
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:28,672
Look, I'm not sure where to go with that.

981
01:02:30,128 --> 01:02:31,987
This one's for stealing my girlfriend.

982
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,529
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.

983
01:02:48,121 --> 01:02:51,503
And Megamind! This one's for
Space, Step-Mom.

984
01:02:51,504 --> 01:02:53,063
You lied to her!

985
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:57,102
Oh, well done, I thought that pummeling
went really, really well.

986
01:02:57,103 --> 01:02:58,981
I mean, I have a few notes.

987
01:02:58,982 --> 01:03:00,470
-Notes?
-But they can wait.

988
01:03:00,481 --> 01:03:01,934
You can take me to jail now.

989
01:03:01,935 --> 01:03:04,897
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking
more like the morgue.

990
01:03:04,898 --> 01:03:06,412
-You're dead!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

991
01:03:06,413 --> 01:03:08,177
This isn't how you play the game.

992
01:03:08,178 --> 01:03:10,001
Game over.

993
01:03:16,301 --> 01:03:17,339
Brain Bots.

994
01:03:23,126 --> 01:03:24,632
I'm calling time out.

995
01:03:25,545 --> 01:03:27,157
Time out, time out!

996
01:03:38,146 --> 01:03:40,982
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.

997
01:03:48,034 --> 01:03:50,347
Guess what, Buster Brown?

998
01:03:50,348 --> 01:03:53,979
It's made from Copper. You're powerless
against it.

999
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,568
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...

1000
01:03:56,569 --> 01:03:58,422
Metro Man?

1001
01:03:58,423 --> 01:04:02,468
You, should stop comparing me
to Metro Man.

1002
01:04:11,623 --> 01:04:14,418
Tighten: You can run Megamind,
but you can't hide.

1003
01:04:14,419 --> 01:04:16,325
Mayor: We're saved, we're saved!

1004
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:18,404
What's your name, new hero?

1005
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:21,007
-It's Tighten.
-Thank you, thank you.

1006
01:04:21,008 --> 01:04:23,138
Tighten has freed us.

1007
01:04:23,139 --> 01:04:25,066
Oh I wouldn't say free.

1008
01:04:25,266 --> 01:04:28,324
Tighten: More like, under new management.

1009
01:04:32,448 --> 01:04:34,540
What do you want?

1010
01:04:34,541 --> 01:04:38,779
-Titan's turned evil.
-Congratulations, another one of your genius
plans has backfired on you.

1011
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,321
And why did my doorman let you up?

1012
01:04:41,828 --> 01:04:45,849
-Carlos?
-What are you, no, no!

1013
01:04:45,850 --> 01:04:46,951
I need your help.

1014
01:04:46,952 --> 01:04:49,375
Why do you need MY help?

1015
01:04:49,376 --> 01:04:53,389
Because you're the
smartest person I know.

1016
01:04:55,078 --> 01:04:56,537
Well you can't hide here.

1017
01:04:56,538 --> 01:04:58,580
Copper should  have worked,
why didn't the copper work?

1018
01:04:58,581 --> 01:05:00,624
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.

1019
01:05:00,625 --> 01:05:02,414
Copper? You're not making any sense.

1020
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:06,171
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.

1021
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,432
Okay, how can I help?

1022
01:05:10,433 --> 01:05:13,336
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.

1023
01:05:13,342 --> 01:05:17,798
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary
fortress of some kind?

1024
01:05:17,805 --> 01:05:19,572
Anything that would give us clues.

1025
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:22,966
Well, there is one place I know.

1026
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,061
Roxanne: You gave him these powers, can't
you just take them away?

1027
01:05:28,067 --> 01:05:32,752
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I
misplaced the invisible car.

1028
01:05:32,759 --> 01:05:34,542
The night you dumped me.

1029
01:05:34,768 --> 01:05:36,904
Alone.

1030
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:38,581
In the rain.

1031
01:05:39,275 --> 01:05:41,182
-Did you ever look back?
-NO! 

1032
01:05:41,183 --> 01:05:45,090
-Oh, my giant blue head.
-I guess we're here.

1033
01:05:48,061 --> 01:05:51,322
So, this is where he hid it.

1034
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:55,824
After all these years. My old shhool house.

1035
01:05:57,932 --> 01:06:01,266
You know, I think there's an
apology in order, for the other night.

1036
01:06:01,270 --> 01:06:03,277
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.

1037
01:06:03,281 --> 01:06:05,441
We have much more pressing
matters to deal with.

1038
01:06:08,842 --> 01:06:13,926
 Wow, can't believe he kept
all this stuff.

1039
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:17,128
Aww, I remember when he
wore that.

1040
01:06:17,133 --> 01:06:18,495
Can we try to stay focused here?

1041
01:06:18,496 --> 01:06:20,625
Yes of course, you're right, focused.

1042
01:06:21,819 --> 01:06:23,988
HEY! Come over and look at this.

1043
01:06:23,990 --> 01:06:26,079
What is it?
What did you find?

1044
01:06:27,663 --> 01:06:30,369
Um.....look!

1045
01:06:30,599 --> 01:06:33,505
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1046
01:06:33,509 --> 01:06:35,112
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.

1047
01:06:35,113 --> 01:06:37,231
No, what I'm saying is,

1048
01:06:37,232 --> 01:06:41,604
don't you think it's a little odd that
the ice hasn't melted yet?

1049
01:06:41,605 --> 01:06:43,239
One of life's great mysteries.

1050
01:06:49,465 --> 01:06:50,648
Hey.

1051
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:51,652
AAAAAAAAH!

1052
01:07:02,679 --> 01:07:04,529
TV News Anchor:
We now have a confirmed report.

1053
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:08,532
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.

1054
01:07:08,533 --> 01:07:11,454
The city has never seen this level
of destruction.

1055
01:07:11,455 --> 01:07:13,912
If only Metro Man were still alive.

1056
01:07:13,913 --> 01:07:15,598
-You're alive?
-You're alive.

1057
01:07:16,623 --> 01:07:17,587
I'm alive.

1058
01:07:17,589 --> 01:07:20,162
Roxanne: But..we..we
saw your skeleton.

1059
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:22,337
-You were dead.
-Are you a ghost?

1060
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:26,223
There had better be, an amazing
explanation for this.

1061
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,809
Speak, apparition.

1062
01:07:38,345 --> 01:07:41,113
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1063
01:07:41,114 --> 01:07:42,547
You both deserve the truth.

1064
01:07:42,906 --> 01:07:45,097
It all started back at the observatory.

1065
01:07:46,101 --> 01:07:49,139
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna
stop you.

1066
01:07:49,951 --> 01:07:52,027
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1067
01:07:52,608 --> 01:07:55,856
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...

1068
01:07:57,101 --> 01:07:58,597
Using my super speed.

1069
01:07:58,598 --> 01:08:00,553
I decided to go clear my head.

1070
01:08:01,828 --> 01:08:08,083
Then I realized we had done this same
silly charade our entire lives.

1071
01:08:08,706 --> 01:08:11,310
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.

1072
01:08:11,797 --> 01:08:13,879
But I just felt stuck.

1073
01:08:14,707 --> 01:08:18,171
I began to realize, despite all my powers,

1074
01:08:18,821 --> 01:08:21,706
each and every citizen of Metro had
something I didn't.

1075
01:08:22,358 --> 01:08:23,549
A choice.

1076
01:08:24,713 --> 01:08:28,737
Ever since I can remember I've always
had to be what the City wanted me to be.

1077
01:08:29,590 --> 01:08:31,633
But what about what I wanted to do?

1078
01:08:32,797 --> 01:08:34,767
Then it suddenly hit me.

1079
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,211
I do have a choice.

1080
01:08:38,044 --> 01:08:40,595
I can be whatever I want to be.

1081
01:08:41,014 --> 01:08:43,567
No one said this hero thing had to
be a life time gig.

1082
01:08:44,335 --> 01:08:46,029
You can't just quit either.

1083
01:08:46,838 --> 01:08:49,003
That's when I got the brilliant idea...

1084
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,694
...to fake my death.

1085
01:08:52,176 --> 01:08:55,160
Copper drains my powers!

1086
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:57,860
You're weakness is copper?

1087
01:08:57,861 --> 01:08:59,205
Once your death ray hit.

1088
01:08:59,993 --> 01:09:02,455
I never felt so alive.

1089
01:09:02,615 --> 01:09:05,507
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby
nursing school.

1090
01:09:05,909 --> 01:09:08,829
Metro Man was finally dead.

1091
01:09:08,830 --> 01:09:10,597
And Music Man was born.

1092
01:09:10,598 --> 01:09:11,729
Music man?

1093
01:09:11,732 --> 01:09:13,190
That way I can keep my logo.

1094
01:09:13,192 --> 01:09:14,194
- WHAT?
-'Cause of what?

1095
01:09:14,198 --> 01:09:17,882
Finally I'm free, to get in touch
with my true power.

1096
01:09:17,889 --> 01:09:20,070
Weaving lyrical magic.

1097
01:09:20,074 --> 01:09:21,215
Check this out.

1098
01:09:28,788 --> 01:09:31,384
- That's horrible.
- Granted you have talent,

1099
01:09:31,389 --> 01:09:35,096
But there's a mad man out there
destroying our...your city.

1100
01:09:36,082 --> 01:09:37,502
How could you do this?

1101
01:09:37,947 --> 01:09:40,481
The people of the city relied on you,

1102
01:09:40,482 --> 01:09:44,497
and you deserted them.
You left us in the hands of, him!

1103
01:09:44,498 --> 01:09:45,597
No offense.

1104
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,759
No, I'm with you.

1105
01:09:47,046 --> 01:09:49,143
Look, we need your help.

1106
01:09:49,150 --> 01:09:52,001
I'm sorry, I really am.

1107
01:09:52,002 --> 01:09:54,121
Um, I'm, I'm done.

1108
01:09:54,122 --> 01:09:58,202
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying
for every Yang.

1109
01:09:58,203 --> 01:10:01,539
Metro Man: If there's bad, good will rise up
against it.

1110
01:10:02,177 --> 01:10:05,031
Metro Man: It's taken me a long time to
find my calling.

1111
01:10:05,717 --> 01:10:08,667
Now it's about time, you find yours.

1112
01:10:13,896 --> 01:10:15,635
Roxanne: Hey, who needs him.

1113
01:10:15,639 --> 01:10:17,629
Roxanne: We can beat Tighten ourselves.

1114
01:10:17,633 --> 01:10:20,501
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns,

1115
01:10:20,504 --> 01:10:23,331
hold them sideways, and just go
all gangsta on 'em.

1116
01:10:24,147 --> 01:10:25,150
We can't

1117
01:10:25,153 --> 01:10:27,394
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1118
01:10:27,402 --> 01:10:29,134
I'm the bad guy.

1119
01:10:29,138 --> 01:10:32,751
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset,

1120
01:10:32,753 --> 01:10:34,941
and I don't get the girl.

1121
01:10:35,997 --> 01:10:37,001
I'm going home.

1122
01:11:06,964 --> 01:11:09,102
TV reporter: Unless someone comes
to our aid soon,

1123
01:11:09,108 --> 01:11:10,982
all may be lost.

1124
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:15,411
Thousands have already fled the city
in a mass exodus.

1125
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:19,550
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay
indoors until further notice.

1126
01:11:21,065 --> 01:11:26,216
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay
out of the downtown area at all costs.

1127
01:11:38,316 --> 01:11:39,323
Hal!

1128
01:11:41,029 --> 01:11:42,031
Hal!

1129
01:11:43,212 --> 01:11:46,721
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am,

1130
01:11:46,722 --> 01:11:48,355
you've finally come to your senses.

1131
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:49,847
Well, I'm over you.

1132
01:11:49,848 --> 01:11:51,643
I've come to stop you, Hal.

1133
01:11:51,644 --> 01:11:55,345
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you
going to do, report me to death?

1134
01:11:55,346 --> 01:11:57,351
I was going to try
reasoning with you.

1135
01:11:57,600 --> 01:12:00,405
You and I, we worked together
for a long time.

1136
01:12:00,406 --> 01:12:01,825
I know you.

1137
01:12:01,826 --> 01:12:03,257
You don't know me.

1138
01:12:03,258 --> 01:12:05,684
You never took the time to know me.

1139
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:10,362
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.

1140
01:12:10,363 --> 01:12:11,842
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1141
01:12:11,843 --> 01:12:15,825
I want to talk to the guy who loved being
a camera man, and eating dip,

1142
01:12:15,827 --> 01:12:19,518
And being a nerd and being not as scary
as the Tighten-Hal.

1143
01:12:19,519 --> 01:12:20,428
To late!

1144
01:12:27,764 --> 01:12:28,856
Megamind.

1145
01:12:30,755 --> 01:12:33,887
You and I have some unfinished business.

1146
01:12:33,888 --> 01:12:38,319
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower,
oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.

1147
01:12:40,127 --> 01:12:41,091
Roxanne!

1148
01:12:41,092 --> 01:12:45,162
Come on Roxi, call for your hero
to come rescue you.

1149
01:12:46,138 --> 01:12:47,406
Megamind.

1150
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:51,000
I don't even know if you're listening,
but if you are...

1151
01:12:51,474 --> 01:12:53,614
You can't give up.

1152
01:12:55,089 --> 01:12:58,953
The Megamind I knew would never
have run from a fight.

1153
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:02,682
Even when he knew he had absolutely
no chance of winning.

1154
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,004
It was your best quality.

1155
01:13:05,324 --> 01:13:08,518
You need to be that guy,
right now.

1156
01:13:10,104 --> 01:13:11,914
The city needs you.

1157
01:13:14,138 --> 01:13:15,720
I need you.

1158
01:13:15,721 --> 01:13:17,320
Roxanne.

1159
01:13:17,321 --> 01:13:21,588
 You have one hour.
Don't...keep me waiting.

1160
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:24,977
Warden, Warden!

1161
01:13:24,978 --> 01:13:29,228
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.

1162
01:13:29,229 --> 01:13:33,026
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life
sentences to go.

1163
01:13:33,027 --> 01:13:35,536
Plenty of time to reflect on what
you've done.

1164
01:13:35,537 --> 01:13:39,052
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.

1165
01:13:39,053 --> 01:13:42,720
Here it is. From the blackest part of my heart.

1166
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:49,182
I....AM....Sorry!

1167
01:13:51,330 --> 01:13:52,598
Not buying it.

1168
01:13:54,990 --> 01:13:56,608
I don't blame you.

1169
01:13:57,866 --> 01:14:00,588
Megamind: I've terrorized the city
countless times.

1170
01:14:00,980 --> 01:14:04,100
Created a hero who's turned out
to be a villain.

1171
01:14:04,107 --> 01:14:07,261
I lied to Roxanne.

1172
01:14:08,034 --> 01:14:10,780
My best friend, Minion.

1173
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,848
I treated like dirt.

1174
01:14:14,944 --> 01:14:17,002
Please, don't make this city,

1175
01:14:18,502 --> 01:14:21,928
don't make Roxanne pay for my
wrong doings.

1176
01:14:25,850 --> 01:14:27,429
Apology accepted.

1177
01:14:30,726 --> 01:14:34,252
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.

1178
01:14:34,253 --> 01:14:35,672
What are we waiting for?

1179
01:14:35,673 --> 01:14:37,525
We'd better get going.

1180
01:14:40,161 --> 01:14:41,350
You got me!

1181
01:14:44,183 --> 01:14:45,731
Good luck, fellows.

1182
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:46,968
Megamind: We're gonna die!

1183
01:14:48,540 --> 01:14:49,797
Minion: Wait, what?

1184
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,743
Hey, Metro losers.

1185
01:14:51,744 --> 01:14:53,627
This is Metro Tower.

1186
01:14:53,628 --> 01:14:56,877
Tighten: They say it's suppose to be a
symbol of our cities strength.

1187
01:14:56,878 --> 01:15:02,224
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day
this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.

1188
01:15:02,225 --> 01:15:04,767
And I hate reminders.

1189
01:15:17,813 --> 01:15:18,989
HAL!

1190
01:15:21,285 --> 01:15:22,515
Please don't do this.

1191
01:15:22,516 --> 01:15:25,223
I know there's still good in you, Hal.

1192
01:15:25,224 --> 01:15:26,721
You're so naive, Roxie.

1193
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:30,171
You see the good in everybody,
even when it's not there.

1194
01:15:30,172 --> 01:15:32,047
You're living a fantasy.

1195
01:15:32,482 --> 01:15:34,141
There is no Easter bunny.

1196
01:15:34,142 --> 01:15:35,893
There is no tooth fairy.

1197
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:37,819
And there is no Queen of England.

1198
01:15:38,397 --> 01:15:41,551
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.

1199
01:15:53,330 --> 01:15:56,714
You dare challenge Megamind?

1200
01:15:57,046 --> 01:15:59,712
This town isn't big enough for
two super villains.

1201
01:15:59,715 --> 01:16:03,093
Oh, you're a villain all right.

1202
01:16:03,095 --> 01:16:05,123
Just not a super one.

1203
01:16:05,124 --> 01:16:06,893
Yeah, what's the difference?

1204
01:16:11,156 --> 01:16:12,836
PRESENTATION!

1205
01:16:32,322 --> 01:16:33,500
I knew you'd come back.

1206
01:16:33,501 --> 01:16:35,658
Well, that makes one of us.

1207
01:17:02,437 --> 01:17:07,057
-What's the plan?
-Well, mostly involves, not dying.

1208
01:17:07,058 --> 01:17:08,226
I, like that plan.

1209
01:17:32,308 --> 01:17:33,932
I can't control it.

1210
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:50,170
No!

1211
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,666
Well, that was easy.

1212
01:17:55,092 --> 01:17:57,319
Looks like there's only one loose
end now.

1213
01:18:08,104 --> 01:18:11,622
Please, let's have a little respect
for public transportation.

1214
01:18:12,385 --> 01:18:14,088
You came back.

1215
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:15,650
You were right, Roxanne.

1216
01:18:15,651 --> 01:18:17,596
I never should have left.

1217
01:18:17,597 --> 01:18:19,841
Whoa, I...I thought you were dead.

1218
01:18:19,842 --> 01:18:23,130
My death was, greatly exaggerated.

1219
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:26,518
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1220
01:18:28,268 --> 01:18:29,244
Ah!

1221
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:43,046
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.

1222
01:18:44,710 --> 01:18:46,434
I'm so proud of you.

1223
01:18:50,454 --> 01:18:51,569
Minion?

1224
01:18:52,308 --> 01:18:54,974
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.

1225
01:18:55,419 --> 01:18:57,706
He's the real hero.

1226
01:19:04,424 --> 01:19:05,764
Megamind.

1227
01:19:07,402 --> 01:19:08,610
Going somewhere?

1228
01:19:09,510 --> 01:19:11,126
Besides jail.

1229
01:19:18,576 --> 01:19:20,671
No, not in the face man, please.

1230
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,106
If you know what's good
for you, Tighten.

1231
01:19:22,107 --> 01:19:23,920
You'll stay out of Montrosity.

1232
01:19:23,921 --> 01:19:25,248
-You got it!
-For good.

1233
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,060
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1234
01:20:02,661 --> 01:20:06,138
But there is only one person I
know who calls this town, Montrosity.

1235
01:20:06,139 --> 01:20:07,142
Ooops.

1236
01:20:07,806 --> 01:20:08,777
You!

1237
01:20:11,873 --> 01:20:13,870
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?

1238
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:18,174
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.

1239
01:20:21,214 --> 01:20:23,180
You're not going to be laughing for long.

1240
01:20:23,955 --> 01:20:27,483
The invisible car. Hey, remember
that night that I dumped you?

1241
01:20:28,664 --> 01:20:30,741
You are bringing this up now?

1242
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:32,252
I did look back.

1243
01:20:33,741 --> 01:20:34,958
You did?

1244
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:36,506
YOU DID!

1245
01:20:36,507 --> 01:20:40,146
Yes, and you should look back,
right now.

1246
01:20:41,256 --> 01:20:42,784
Oh, I get it.

1247
01:20:50,872 --> 01:20:53,388
This is the last time you'll make
a fool out of me.

1248
01:20:53,389 --> 01:20:55,822
I made you a hero.

1249
01:20:55,823 --> 01:20:59,576
You did the fool thing,
all by yourself.

1250
01:21:06,324 --> 01:21:07,950
You're so pathetic.

1251
01:21:07,951 --> 01:21:09,779
No matter what side you're on.

1252
01:21:09,780 --> 01:21:11,587
You're always the looser.

1253
01:21:11,949 --> 01:21:13,780
There's a benefit to loosing.

1254
01:21:14,083 --> 01:21:16,259
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1255
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,500
What?

1256
01:21:21,373 --> 01:21:23,408
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

1257
01:21:23,409 --> 01:21:25,789
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

1258
01:21:36,133 --> 01:21:37,938
Enjoy your flight.

1259
01:21:38,483 --> 01:21:39,697
 AAAAAAAAH!

1260
01:21:39,803 --> 01:21:41,298
Megamind.

1261
01:21:48,889 --> 01:21:51,342
Megamind Narrates:
So, this is how it ends.

1262
01:21:51,795 --> 01:21:55,844
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last
glorious failure.

1263
01:21:57,314 --> 01:21:58,626
But not today!

1264
01:21:59,697 --> 01:22:00,864
What can I say?

1265
01:22:01,289 --> 01:22:03,072
Old habits die hard.

1266
01:22:09,718 --> 01:22:11,758
Say bye, bye Roxie.

1267
01:22:16,596 --> 01:22:17,936
Ollo.

1268
01:22:27,254 --> 01:22:30,356
Thing about bad guys,
they always LOOSE!

1269
01:22:35,291 --> 01:22:37,257
We did it, you won.

1270
01:22:37,258 --> 01:22:40,499
Well, I finally had a reason to win.

1271
01:22:41,518 --> 01:22:42,691
You.

1272
01:22:50,998 --> 01:22:52,001
MINION!

1273
01:22:52,030 --> 01:22:56,938
Can't see it's cold and...
warm, and dark and light.

1274
01:22:56,946 --> 01:22:58,358
It's me, Minion.

1275
01:22:58,361 --> 01:22:59,756
I'm right here.

1276
01:22:59,759 --> 01:23:01,762
We've had a lot of adventures together.

1277
01:23:01,766 --> 01:23:02,972
You and I.

1278
01:23:02,974 --> 01:23:04,202
We have, Minion.

1279
01:23:04,203 --> 01:23:06,738
I mean...

1280
01:23:06,744 --> 01:23:11,253
most of them ended in horrible
failure, but,

1281
01:23:11,260 --> 01:23:15,039
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?

1282
01:23:15,040 --> 01:23:17,564
Yes Minion, we did it.

1283
01:23:17,569 --> 01:23:18,944
Thanks to you.

1284
01:23:18,947 --> 01:23:22,905
Code-We're the good guys now.

1285
01:23:22,911 --> 01:23:27,185
Code-I guess we are.

1286
01:23:27,515 --> 01:23:30,475
Oh, oh. I'm going...I think this...

1287
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:33,201
This is it, I  mean I'm going far awa...

1288
01:23:43,639 --> 01:23:45,583
Oh, what a drama queen.

1289
01:23:46,411 --> 01:23:48,178
You know, I'm feeling much better now.

1290
01:23:48,188 --> 01:23:49,968
I guess I just needed a swim

1291
01:23:49,971 --> 01:23:51,780
-He had you, didn't he.
-Whew!

1292
01:23:51,783 --> 01:23:54,324
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.

1293
01:23:54,329 --> 01:23:56,796
Megamind: There he is with that
little face. Look at that face.

1294
01:23:56,801 --> 01:23:59,267
We did it!
We did it!

1295
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:01,382
-Fist pump!
-You did it!

1296
01:24:01,386 --> 01:24:03,247
We won, we won, we won.

1297
01:24:03,251 --> 01:24:07,303
What! Get back you savages!

1298
01:24:07,309 --> 01:24:11,373
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to
positive feedback.

1299
01:24:14,702 --> 01:24:19,267
Funny, I guess destiny is not the
path given to us.

1300
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:24,331
But the path we choose
for ourselves.

1301
01:24:32,565 --> 01:24:34,690
All right, put your hands in the air.

1302
01:24:38,248 --> 01:24:40,202
Now hand over your wallets.

1303
01:24:40,203 --> 01:24:43,065
I'm just kidding.

1304
01:24:43,066 --> 01:24:44,749
Just kidding.

1305
01:24:44,753 --> 01:24:46,350
I have to admit.

1306
01:24:46,354 --> 01:24:49,313
Being good, has its perks.

1307
01:24:50,509 --> 01:24:53,152
You know, you look pretty good
in white.

1308
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:57,322
Megamind, if you please.

1309
01:25:01,007 --> 01:25:03,238
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.

1310
01:25:03,242 --> 01:25:05,310
Sorry my friend.

1311
01:25:05,315 --> 01:25:09,375
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.

1312
01:25:09,381 --> 01:25:12,618
Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!

1313
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:15,358
Defender of Metro City.

1314
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:20,254
You know, I like the sound of that.

1315
01:25:20,605 --> 01:25:21,638
Hit it!

1316
01:25:42,662 --> 01:25:44,543
I'm bad, I'm bad, that's right
