1
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,550
Here is my day so far.

2
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:43,860
Went to jail,lost the girl of my dreams,

3
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,090
and got my butt kicked pretty good.

4
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,880
Still,things could be a lot worse.

5
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,420
Oh,that's right.

6
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,730
I'm falling to my death.

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:56,750
Guess they can't.

8
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,510
How'd it all come to this,you ask?

9
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,600
My end starts at the beginning.

10
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,650
The very beginning.

11
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,920
Yes,that's me.

12
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,700
I had a fairly standard childhood.

13
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,750
I came from what you might call a broken home.

14
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:20,690
Literally broken.

15
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,310
I was eight days old and still living with my parents.

16
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:26,430
How sad is that?

17
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,810
Clearly it was time to move on.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,960
Here is your minion,he will take care of you.

19
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:33,580
And here is your blinky.

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,420
You are destined for...

21
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,740
I didn't quite hear that last part,

22
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:40,580
but it sounded important.

23
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,270
Destined for...what?

24
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:47,940
I set out to find my destiny.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,090
Turns out

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,670
a kid from Flaupunkt Quadrant

27
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,850
had the exaxt same idea

28
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,840
That was the day

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,040
I met Mr. Goody two-shoes...

30
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,060
... and our glorious rivalry was born.

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,370
Could this be what I was destined for?

32
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,140
A dream life filled with luxury.

33
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,580
Apparently not.

34
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:28,030
Even fate picks its favorites.

35
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,290
No big deal.

36
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,500
A much different fate awaited me.

37
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,750
A baby! How thoughtful!

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,420
Oh,yes. yes,

39
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,820
I saw it and thought of you.

40
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,140
Luckily

41
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,000
I found a lovely little place to call home.

42
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Can we keep it?

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,180
A place that taught me the differences between right...

44
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,000
... and wrong.

45
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,800
Mr. Goody two-shoes,on the other hand,

46
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,680
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

47
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,230
Our baby can fly.

48
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:06,850
Yes,yes,

49
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,590
nothing but the best for you,darling.

50
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,180
The power of flight,invulnerability,

51
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:12,920
and great hair.

52
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,400
But I had something far,far greater.

53
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,560
My amazing intellect...

54
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,510
... and knack for building objects of mayhem.

55
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:32,210
After a few years,and with some time off for good behavior,

56
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:36,240
I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning...

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,810
... at a strange place called shool.

58
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,300
It was there

59
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,530
that I once again ran into Mr. Goody two-shoes.

60
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,460
He is already a master of gigantic army of soft-headed groupies.

61
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:57,290
He bought their affections with showmanship,

62
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,600
and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

63
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,200
So I,too,will make this popped corn

64
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,670
and win over those mindless drones.

65
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,810
Lights out.

66
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,910
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.

67
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:30,860
Good receives all the praise and adulation,

68
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,980
While evil is sent to quiet-time in the corner.

69
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,110
So fitting in wasn't really an option.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,600
While they were learning the itsy bitsy spider...

71
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,060
I learned how to dehydrate animate objects,

72
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,770
rehydrate them at will.

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,890
Some days,

74
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:49,520
it felt like

75
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:53,040
it was just me and minion against the world.

76
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,020
No matter how hard I tried,

77
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,410
I was always the odd man out.

78
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,230
The last one picked,

79
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,670
The screw-up,the black sheep...

80
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,140
Get him!

81
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,410
- The bad boy. - Freak!

82
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,650
Weirdo!

83
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,750
Was this my destiny?

84
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:21,990
Wait,maybe it was.

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,990
Being bad is the one thing I'm good at.

86
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,260
Then it hit me. If I was the bad boy,

87
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,380
then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all.

88
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,910
I was destined to be a super-villain,

89
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,630
and we were destined to be rivals.

90
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,550
The die has been cast.

91
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,430
And so began an enduring,epic,

92
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,960
lifelong career.

93
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,110
And I loved it.

94
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,600
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

95
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,430
He would win some.

96
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,440
I would almost win others.

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,030
He took the name Metro man,

98
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,840
defender of Metrocity.

99
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:08,540
I decided to pick something a little more humbled...

100
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,680
Megamind

101
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,600
... incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy.

102
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,040
Read on your own time. Open up.

103
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,260
Oh,good morning,Warden.

104
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,880
Great news. I'm a changed man,and...

105
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,160
...and I'm ready to re-enter society as a solid citizen.

106
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,680
You're a villain,and you'll always be a villain.

107
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,480
You'll never change,and you'll never leave.

108
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,670
You're fun.

109
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,550
You got a present in the mail.

110
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,520
Is it a puppy?

111
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,160
From Metro man:

112
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,090
" to count every second of your 85 life sentences."

113
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:04,970
That's funny.

114
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,000
Never thought Metro man

115
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,250
was the gloating type.

116
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,440
Oh,but he does have nice taste. I think I'll keep it.

117
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:12,660
Any chance you could give me the time?

118
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:15,820
I don't want to be late for the opening of the Metro man museum.

119
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,360
Oh no. Looks like you're gonna miss it,

120
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,610
By several thousand years.

121
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:23,980
Oh,am I?

122
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,120
Happy Metro man day,Metro city.

123
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,490
It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown,

124
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,010
Where we're here to honor a beautiful man,

125
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
Metro man.

126
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:46,300
His heart is an ocean that's inside a bigger ocean.

127
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:49,740
For years he's been watching us with his super-vision,

128
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,780
Saving us with his super-strength

129
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,440
and caring for us with his super-heart.

130
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:57,420
Now it's our turn to give something back.

131
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,760
This is Roxanne Ritchi,

132
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,490
reporting live from the dedication

133
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,220
of the Metro man museum.

134
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,970
Wow. Ok,the stuff they make you read on-air,

135
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,480
that's un-freaking-believable. It's crazy.

136
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,190
I wrote that piece myself,Hal.

137
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,530
What I was trying to say was,

138
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,340
I can't believe that in our modern society,

139
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:17,130
they let,like,actual art get onto the news.

140
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,400
- Nice save,Hal. - What are we...

141
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,470
Like,let's just get a coffee or something.

142
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:23,600
Come on,it's time to get the Metro man day spirit.

143
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,980
Well,if I were Metro man,

144
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,060
Megamind wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,620
- That's the first thing. - That's sweet,Hal.

146
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,650
I will be watching you

147
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,970
like a dingo watches a human baby.

148
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,580
Ok,that sounded...

149
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,610
Ok,that sounded a little weird.

150
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,890
A little bit,yeah.

151
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,380
And you're making a weird face,and that's making me feel weird.

152
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,270
I would watch you like something has walked around

153
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:42,640
and pretending to be in love.

154
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,090
Not love. We're not in love.

155
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm not saying I love you.

156
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,570
Hey,I love you. Whatever.

157
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,890
But I'm not saying like I'm in love with you. I'm saying...

158
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,630
Roxanne? roxaroo?

159
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,280
Whoa... What?

160
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,320
Get back to work.

161
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,190
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

162
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,440
- Freeze! - Whoa. What are you doing,guys?

163
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,050
It's me! It's the warden.

164
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,020
Hey! Open up!

165
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,350
No,you fools. He's tricked us.

166
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:27,480
You were right.

167
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,950
I'll always be a villain.

168
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,480
Oh,hello,good looking. Need a lift?

169
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,260
Certainly do,you fantastic fish you.

170
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,770
- Get in the car,you. - I'm free!

171
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,750
Right?

172
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,710
Nice work sending me the watch,minion.

173
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,290
- You got it,boss. - Punch it!

174
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:07,740
All right,put your hands in the air.

175
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,890
Ladies and gentlemen,

176
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,990
your Metro man!

177
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,480
- Who's your man? - Metro man!

178
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,390
Yeah,Metro city!

179
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,510
Gimme some. Come on. Give it now.

180
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,960
Give it to me. Right on. Gimme the good stuff. All right.

181
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,340
Hey,Metro city.

182
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,200
You know,you know,I just want to bring it down a bit.

183
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,590
Boys,a little lower. Thank you,fellas.

184
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:00,370
Let's get real for a moment.

185
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,080
That's right. That's right. That's right.

186
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:05,730
Although getting a whole museum

187
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,970
is super-cool,is super-cool,

188
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:08,810
You want to know

189
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,470
what the greatest honor you've given me is?

190
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,890
Do you really want to know? Really?

191
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:16,310
I'll tell you.

192
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,000
The greatest honor you've given me is letting me serve you,

193
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,100
the helpless people of Metro city.

194
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,870
And at the end of every day,

195
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:27,950
well,I often ask myself...

196
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,980
...who would I be without you?

197
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:33,410
I love you,Metro man!

198
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,990
And I love you,random citizen.

199
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,920
I tell you,minion.

200
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:47,010
There's no place like evil lair.

201
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,390
I've kept it cold and damp

202
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,770
just for you,sir.

203
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,100
How do I look,minion?

204
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,250
Do I look bad?

205
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,170
Disgustingly horrifying,sir.

206
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,770
You always know what to say.

207
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,390
Oh,the brain-bots certainly missed you,sir.

208
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,780
Did you miss your daddy? Who's a menacing little cyborg?

209
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,200
You are. Yes,you are. No biting.

210
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:07,370
No,no,no,no,no,no

211
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,980
You want the wrench? Go get the wrench.

212
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:12,510
- Oh,look at that. - Now,back to laughing.

213
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,970
She's awake. Quick,to work.

214
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,340
Miss Ritchi,we meet again.

215
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,180
Would it kill you to wash the bag?

216
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,500
You can scream all you wish,Miss Ritchi.

217
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,310
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

218
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,040
Wh... why isn't she screaming?

219
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:49,350
Miss Ritchi,if you don't mind.

220
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:50,640
Like this...

221
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:52,630
But that's,that's a poor lady scream.

222
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,320
He's a little better.

223
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,810
Is there some kind of nerdy super-villain web site

224
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,150
where you get

225
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,180
tesla coils and blinky dials?

226
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,030
Actually,most of it comes from an outlet store in...

227
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,090
Don't answer that.

228
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,190
- Romania. - Don't! Stop!

229
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,860
She's using her nosy reporter skills

230
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,510
on your weak-willed mind to find out all our secrets.

231
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,600
Such tricks won't work on me...

232
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,320
- Please talk slower. ...- Temptress.

233
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:28,700
What secrets? You're so predictable.

234
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,670
Predictable? predictable?

235
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:34,360
Oh,you call this predictable?

236
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,280
Your alligators. Yes.

237
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:39,310
Yeah,I was thinking about it on the way over.

238
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,980
What's this? Boom! In your face.

239
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,380
- Clich? - No! Look,watch.

240
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,610
- Juvenile. - Shock and awe.

241
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,950
- Tacky. - Oh,it's so scary!

242
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,690
- Seen it. - What's this one do?

243
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,740
Garish.

244
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:57,450
- Ok,the spider's new. - Spider?

245
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:04,850
Yes,the... the spee-ider.

246
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,780
Even the smallest bite from arachnis deathicus

247
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:10,330
will instantly paralyze...

248
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,440
Get it off! It bit me!

249
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,790
Give it up,Megamind.

250
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:16,110
Your plans never work.

251
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:18,830
Let's stop wasting time

252
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,440
and call your boyfriend in tights,

253
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,310
shall we?

254
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:26,360
It is with great pleasure that I present to

255
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,330
Metro man his new museum.

256
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,570
If you please.

257
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:37,440
Metro man!

258
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,310
Hey! My kid can't see.

259
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,130
Megamind!

260
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,420
Oh,bravo,Metro man.

261
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,000
Boo!

262
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,980
Yes,I can play along too. Boo!

263
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,240
Should've known you'd try to crash the party.

264
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:17,720
Oh,I intend to do more than crash it.

265
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:23,470
This is a day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget.

266
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,750
It's pronounced Metro city!

267
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,470
Potato-tomato,potato-tomato.

268
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,170
We all know how this ends,

269
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,780
with you behind bars.

270
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,030
I'm shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots.

271
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,130
You will leave Metrocity,

272
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,510
or this will be the last.

273
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,560
You ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi.

274
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,170
Roxanne! Don't panic,Roxie.

275
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,180
- I'm on my way. - Yeah,I'm not panicking.

276
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,240
In order to stop me,you need to find me first,

277
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,550
Metro man.

278
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:53,970
We're at the abandoned observatory.

279
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:55,970
No,we're not!

280
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,090
Don't listen to her,she's crazy.

281
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,760
Metro man approaching,sir.

282
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,600
Hold on a second.

283
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,650
Oh,good heavens!

284
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:55,860
You didn't think you were in the real observatory,did you?

285
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,250
Ready the death ray,minion.

286
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,850
Death ray,readying.

287
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:10,650
Over here,old friend.

288
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,920
In case you haven't noticed,

289
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,200
you've fallen right into my trap.

290
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,330
You can't trap justice.

291
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,220
It's an idea,a belief.

292
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:19,160
Even the most heartfelt belief

293
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,690
can be corroded over time.

294
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,600
Justice is a non-corrosive metal.

295
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:25,160
But metals can be melted by the heat of revange.

296
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,350
It's "revenge," and it's best served cold.

297
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,970
But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil.

298
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,130
Well,I think your warranty is about to expire.

299
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:33,540
Maybe I got an extended warranty.

300
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,040
Warranties are invalid if you don't

301
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,490
use the product for its intended purpose.

302
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,560
Oh,girls,girls,you're both pretty.

303
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,510
can I go home now?

304
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,000
Of course. that is,if Metro Man can withstand the full,

305
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,660
concentrated power of the sun!

306
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:47,660
Fire!

307
00:17:58,090 --> 00:17:59,620
Minion. fire?

308
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,190
- It's still warming up,sir. - Come again?

309
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:05,710
- Warming up,sir. - Warming up? the sun is warming up?

310
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:09,860
One second more and...

311
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,070
...just tippy-tappy tippy-tap-tap,tip-top more,

312
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,560
- and we are ready in just... - Honestly!

313
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,820
On my way,roxie.

314
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,160
I told you to have things ready. I told you countless times.

315
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,450
Why do you always blame me?

316
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,880
My spider bite is acting up.

317
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,520
Your plan is failing. Just admit it.

318
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,010
Yeah,good luck with that one.

319
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,820
Whose side are you on?

320
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,630
- The losing side. - Thank you.

321
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,920
Could someone stamp my frequent kidnapping card?

322
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,740
You of all people know we discontinued that promotion.

323
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:44,800
- Ciao-ciao,all! - Same time next week?

324
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,720
Dag! Crab nuggets!

325
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:52,840
- What did he just say? - "Crab nuggets"?

326
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,140
Fackled fish cracker!

327
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,330
Ten seconds to full power.

328
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,770
- Good lord,I'm trapped. - Ten...

329
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,690
- What kind of trickery is this? - ...nine...

330
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,600
- You mad genius. -...eight...

331
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,760
- Your dark gift has finally paid off. -...seven...

332
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:08,430
- It... it has? -...six...

333
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,040
This dome is obviously lined with copper.

334
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,750
- Yeah? So? - Sir...

335
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,500
- Copper drains my powers. -...two...

336
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,700
- Your weakness is copper? -...one.

337
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,930
- You're kidding,right? - Full power.

338
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:50,280
I don't think even he could survive that.

339
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,410
Well,let's not get our hopes up just yet.

340
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,170
- Look! - Metro man!

341
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,790
Metro man.

342
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,300
Metro man!

343
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:19,920
- You... you did it,sir. - I did it?

344
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:24,780
He did it.

345
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,970
- I did it? - He did it.

346
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,830
- You did it,sir. - I did it!

347
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,670
- You did it! - I did it! Metrocity is mine!

348
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,910
- You did it,sir! - I did it! Yeah,me,me!

349
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,190
- Yes,I did it! - Us! We both did it!

350
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,270
- Not us! I! - You,a little more

351
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:45,120
- than me but still,come on! - A lot more than you.

352
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:46,730
When they're giving out the awards,

353
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:48,480
I'm gonna be right there next to you.

354
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,670
What awards? What awards,for what?

355
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:50,990
Hit it!

356
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,230
Drop 'em!

357
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,620
First off,what a turnout.

358
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,050
How wild is this?

359
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,700
All I did was eliminate the most powerful man in the universe.

360
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,740
Are there any questions? Go on. Yes! you in the back.

361
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:11,370
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan to do with us and this city.

362
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,330
Good,I'm glad you asked that.

363
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,980
Imagine the most horrible,terrifying,

364
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,880
evil thing you can possibly think of,

365
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:24,060
And multiply it... by six!

366
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,580
In the meantime,

367
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,680
I want you to carry on with the dreary,normal things

368
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:33,130
you normal people do.

369
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,220
Let's just have fun with this. Come on.

370
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,700
And I will get back to you.

371
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,720
Now slam the door really hard.

372
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:48,180
They... they can still see you.

373
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,660
- Now? - Your elbow's still in.

374
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,110
Good.

375
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,130
There he is,Mr. evil overlord

376
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:02,870
Oh,Minion,did you think this day would ever come?

377
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,350
No way. Not at all,sir.

378
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,430
Never. never in a million... I mean...

379
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,630
- Yes,I did. - Look at the intricate mouldings.

380
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,840
I'm looking. I'm looking.

381
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:14,920
And what's this?

382
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,060
It's like one of the giant monitors in the lair.

383
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,650
But it seems to only carry one station.

384
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,880
Oh,that,sir,is called a window.

385
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:27,830
- Window? - All the kids are looking through them.

386
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:31,260
I've never had a view before.

387
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:34,790
Metrocity,Minion,it's all mine.

388
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,180
If my parents could see me now.

389
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:42,450
Sir,I'm sure they're smiling down from evil heaven.

390
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,380
And now that Mr. goody two-shoes is out of the way,

391
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,170
I can have everything I want,

392
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:52,020
and there's no one to stop me!

393
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:37,150
I know. I know.

394
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,170
Always thirsty,never satisfied.

395
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:44,730
I understand you,little well-dressed bird.

396
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,360
Purposeless,emptiness. it's a vacuum,isn't it?

397
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:52,920
It's... What's your vacuum like?

398
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,700
Not now,minion.

399
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,160
I'm in a heated,existential discussion

400
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,990
with this dead-eyed,plastic desk toy.

401
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,480
Is... is something wrong,sir?

402
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,450
Just think about it.

403
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:17,260
We have it all.

404
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,080
Yet,we have nothing.

405
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,580
It's just too easy now.

406
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,620
I'm sorry,you've lost me,sir.

407
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:31,430
I mean,we did it,right?

408
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,560
Well,you did it,sir.

409
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,930
Yes,you've made that perfectly clear.

410
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,630
Then why do I feel so... mel-on-choly.

411
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,030
"Mel-on-choly"?

412
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,380
- Unhappy. - Well...

413
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:47,640
What if tomorrow,

414
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,410
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

415
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,580
That always seems to lift your spirits.

416
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,190
Good idea,Minion.

417
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,050
but without him,what's the point?

418
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,020
- "Him," sir? - Nothing.

419
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,070
Ok,all right. we'll just... that's something to consider...

420
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,930
...and... well,I think I'll just power down for a while then.

421
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:21,910
He was always there for us. Dependable.

422
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:26,410
Perhaps we took him for granted. You know,maybe,

423
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:29,970
We never really know how good we have it until it's gone.

424
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:35,040
We miss you,Metro Man. I miss you.

425
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:38,760
And I have just one question.

426
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,800
Are you happy now?

427
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,250
This is Roxanne Ritchi,

428
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:46,780
reporting from a city without a hero.

429
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,360
Coming up next,are you ready to be a slave army? What you need to know.

430
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:03,230
And... wrap that up and give it to a child on christmas,

431
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,070
- 'Cause we're done. - Ok. See you tomorrow,Hal.

432
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:09,510
Wait. Roxie,I'm having a party at my house.

433
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,470
It's gonna be,like,off the hook,or whatever.

434
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,000
You should come over. I got a deejay,

435
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,130
Rented a bouncy house,made a gallon of dip.

436
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,250
It's gonna be sick.

437
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:18,220
Oh. I... I don't know,Hal.

438
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,370
I don't really feel like being around a bunch of people.

439
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:22,350
No,no,no,that's the best part. it'll just be like you and me.

440
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:28,500
Wow. That... that's certainly very tempting,but...

441
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:31,760
I did hire a wedding photographer. that's just in case we were like,

442
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,810
something crazy happened and we wanted a picture of it.

443
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:37,050
Like,maybe we should have this for,like,ever. like a memory,you know?

444
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,010
I'm gonna pass.

445
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:42,030
I have some work here that I need to do,anyway.

446
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,520
Cool. So Thursday? Soft Thursday?

447
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,630
- Good night,Hal. - That's a soft yes on Thursday.

448
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,950
What's wrong with me? Rented a bouncy house?

449
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,840
Chicks don't like bouncy houses.

450
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,930
They like clowns.

451
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,350
Stupid van! You broke my finger!

452
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,730
I've made a horrible mistake.

453
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,270
I didn't mean to destroy you.

454
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:44,170
I mean,I meant to destroy you,

455
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:46,540
But I didn't think it would really work.

456
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:48,850
What are we supposed to do?

457
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:53,430
Without you,evil is running rampant through the streets.

458
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:56,840
I'm so tired of running rampant through the streets.

459
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,010
What's the point of being bad

460
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:00,980
when there's no good to try and stop you?

461
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,580
Someone has to stop Megamind.

462
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,760
- Hey,we're closing soon. - You scared me.

463
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,820
- Barry,right? - Bernard.

464
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:13,250
Bernard. I was just... well,I was talking to myself.

465
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,850
You probably think I'm a little bit nuts.

466
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,910
I'm not allowed to insult guests directly.

467
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,840
Thank you. Just... Bernard,I'll just be another minute.

468
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:22,740
Ok.

469
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:23,740
Thanks.

470
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,120
I had so many evil plans in the works.

471
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,230
The illiteracy beam.

472
00:29:29,930 --> 00:29:31,260
Typhoon cheese.

473
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,060
Robo-sheep.

474
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,380
Battles we will now never have.

475
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,580
You know,I never had the chance to say goodbye.

476
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,770
So it's good that we have this time now.

477
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,280
You know,before I destroy the place.

478
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:50,830
Nothing personal,it just brings back too many painful memories.

479
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:55,880
Hello?

480
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,910
- Hello? - Roxanne.

481
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,500
- That's a pretty tasteless costume. - Costume?

482
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,380
Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.

483
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,170
And you even made a cheap replica of his dehydration gun. How...

484
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,130
Hello? Is someone there?

485
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,090
Hello? Who's there?

486
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,610
It's just you,Bernard.

487
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,260
Yes. it's just me. Bernard.

488
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,720
Well,thank you for letting me stay.

489
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,530
Look,I wouldn't stay here for more than two minutes and 37 seconds

490
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,900
If I were you. we're having the walls and ceiling removed.

491
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,430
Wow,that sounds like quite the renovation.

492
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:47,100
I guess I'll catch a ride down with you then.

493
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,300
I kept thinking he was gonna do one of his last-minute escapes.

494
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:00,960
Yeah. He was really good at those.

495
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,720
Oh,if only the world had a reset button.

496
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,440
I've looked into the reset button.

497
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,060
The science is impossible.

498
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:10,910
Oh,Bernard...

499
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,560
I didn't know you had... feelings. Are you ok?

500
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,200
Metro Man's gone. and now there's no one left to challenge Megamind.

501
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,380
Oh,come on,Bernard.

502
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:26,560
As long as there's evil,good will rise up against it.

503
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,940
Oh,I wish.

504
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,910
I believe someone is gonna stand up to Megamind.

505
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,360
- You really think so? - Yeah. I mean,it's like they say,

506
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,970
"Heroes aren't born,they're made."

507
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:41,980
Heroes can be made. that's it!

508
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,350
All you need are the right ingredients.

509
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,790
- Yeah. Bravery. - Yes.

510
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,940
- Strength. - Of course.

511
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,950
- Determination. - Imperative!

512
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:51,730
And a smidgen of DNA.

513
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:54,340
Oh,with that,anyone can be a hero!

514
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:55,260
Yeah!

515
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,020
I think we should run!

516
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,310
Bye!

517
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,260
Time to put the past behind us.

518
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,060
Only the future...

519
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,340
I'm too close! I'm genuinely scared right now.

520
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:11,340
I hope no one's seeing this!

521
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,680
Create a hero? Wait,wait,what? Why would you do that?

522
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,620
So I have someone to fight.

523
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,320
Minion,I'm a villain without a hero.

524
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,350
A yin with no yang.

525
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:24,570
A bullfighter with no bull to fight.

526
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,320
In other words,I have no purpose.

527
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:31,820
Now,ask me how I'm going to do it. Go on! Ask!

528
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:33,200
How are you gonna do it?

529
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,590
I'm going to give someone... I don't know who yet...

530
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,200
Metro Man's powers.

531
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:43,340
I'm going to train that someone to become Metrocity's new hero.

532
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,680
Over here! Follow!

533
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,610
And then finally,I'm going to fight that hero

534
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:50,360
In an epic battle of good and evil.

535
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:53,360
Which will put everything back the way it was...

536
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,690
...when the world was perfect and rosy.

537
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,080
Behold,Minion,Metro Man's cape.

538
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,100
Look closely. Tell me what you see.

539
00:33:03,310 --> 00:33:06,630
- Dandruff? - Yes. It's his DNA.

540
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,760
From this,we'll extract the source of Metro Man's awesome power.

541
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,680
Sir,I think this is a bad idea.

542
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,430
Yes! This is a very wickedly bad idea for the greater good of man.

543
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,220
But I'm saying this is a kind of bad that...

544
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:27,410
...ok,you might think is good in your bad perception,

545
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,670
But from a good perception it... it's just plain bad.

546
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,060
Oh,you don't know what's good for bad.

547
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,520
Now,we have just one shot at this.

548
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,910
We must find a suitable subject,

549
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,430
someone of noble heart and mind.

550
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:46,000
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

551
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,920
What on earth is that?

552
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:53,090
It seems to be emanating from there,sir.

553
00:33:55,930 --> 00:33:56,650
Ollo.

554
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:57,880
It's "hello."

555
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,060
Hello? like that?

556
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,930
- Bernard,it's Roxanne. - It's Roxanne.

557
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,800
I just wanted to thank you for inspiring me the other day.

558
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,210
- Oh,you inspired me too. - Great!

559
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:09,110
It's time we stood up to megamind

560
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,740
and show him he can't push us around.

561
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,110
Oh,really? She's so cute.

562
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:15,250
I'm already hot on his trail.

563
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,760
- And what gives you that idea? - Sir?

564
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,910
I just found his secret hideout.

565
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,580
How did she find my hideout?!

566
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:24,990
How did you find his hideout?

567
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,210
This is the only building in metro city

568
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:29,520
with a fake observatory on the roof.

569
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:34,880
Ok. There's no way she'll find the secret entrance.

570
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,790
There's a doormat here that says "secrit entrance"!

571
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:41,810
- Minion! - I kept forgetting where it was.

572
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,380
She'll discover all our secrets!

573
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,410
- Oh,no! - You dim-witted creation of science!

574
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:47,200
What?

575
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:48,220
What? Oh,no,not you,Roxanne.

576
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:50,800
No,I was just yelling at my... mother's urn.

577
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,620
Don't do anything. I'll be right there.

578
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,130
Roxanne?

579
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:56,840
Oh no,not again!

580
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,770
Roxanne?  Wow!

581
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:06,790
I'm glad you're here.

582
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,430
Wait,how did you get here so fast?

583
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:12,330
Well,I... I happened to be speed walking nearby when you called.

584
00:35:12,530 --> 00:35:13,080
In a suit?

585
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,200
It's called... formal speed walking,but that's not important.

586
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,640
I better take the lead. This way looks exciting.

587
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:20,800
No,it says "exit."

588
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,090
Which is the abbreviation for "exciting," right?

589
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:26,030
This is the mother lode!

590
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:29,330
Wow. Just look at this thing.

591
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,340
You know,I really could use your help in deciphering all this.

592
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,080
Really?

593
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:35,150
You're an expert on all things megamind,right?

594
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,360
Yes. right.

595
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:40,260
Together,we could figure out his plan for the city and stop it.

596
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,950
- Are you in? - Oh,what fun!

597
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,230
That's what I want to hear.

598
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:46,580
Minion,code: Send in the brain-bots.

599
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,920
You know,the whole point of a code is...

600
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,840
Oh,code: Just do it,minion.

601
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,660
Intruder! intruder! intruder!

602
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,850
- It's me,you fools! - Bernard!

603
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,010
It's daddy!

604
00:36:03,450 --> 00:36:04,490
Megamind.

605
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,920
What have you done with bernard?

606
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,430
Oh,Bernard? Oh,yes.

607
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,540
I'm doing horrible things to that man.

608
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:12,100
I don't want to get into it,but lasers,spikes.

609
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,650
No,please! No! Not the lasers and the spikes!

610
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:18,610
- You know the drill. - Oh,no! Not the drill!

611
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,990
- Let him go or... - Or what?

612
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,660
Or I'm gonna find out what this weird-looking gun does.

613
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,300
No,don't shoot! Don't shoot that gun!

614
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,500
I'll just go get him.

615
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,490
- Unhand me,you fiend! - Never!

616
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,730
His strength's too much!

617
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,860
Oh,I work out!

618
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:38,330
Well,it's really paying off! You're so fit,

619
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,380
And strangely charismatic.

620
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:44,940
Are you ok?

621
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,820
I did my best,but he's too fantastic.

622
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,490
Here. Let me carry that heavy gun for you.

623
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,550
I got us covered.

624
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,960
- Let go. It's mine! - Bernard,run!

625
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,240
Roxanne?

626
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,680
- You're going to break it! - Give it to me!

627
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,660
Oh,no!

628
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:09,090
Roxanne?!

629
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,060
Who on earth is that?

630
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,220
- Help! - Roxanne!

631
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,930
Bernard! You were right about that door being exciting.

632
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:33,360
- Intruder! Intruder! - This way.

633
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,060
Intruder! Intruder! Intruder!

634
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,230
What are you doing?

635
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,950
This'll stop them. Here!

636
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,190
Seems a bit extreme,doesn't it?

637
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:48,550
- Just throw it! - Daddy's sorry.

638
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,340
- Wow. That was really exciting. - Yeah.

639
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,200
- You were very strong in there. - I know.

640
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:05,400
I've never seen anyone

641
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,120
but metro man stand up to him like that.

642
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:09,540
- What's going on? - Hal,what happened?

643
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:11,240
I think a bee flew up my nose.

644
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:14,270
I was just about to make my frontal assault to rescue you,

645
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,450
But like 50 ninjas tried to attack me,

646
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,100
so I had to beat 'em all up,

647
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:20,340
And I did,and I... they were all,like,crying and stuff...

648
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,250
- Wow,a brave one,isn't he? - Who are you?

649
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,900
Oh,thi... this is Bernard. he's my partner.

650
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:28,460
- Partner? - Yes,yes. Partner.

651
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,810
Well,look,"partner," I'm her partner.

652
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,650
She doesn't know what she's saying.

653
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,130
She's been through a traumatic experience.

654
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,550
I'd better take him home. Thanks again,Bernard.

655
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,610
I'll call you tomorrow,partner.

656
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,700
Yeah,ok. I'd like that.

657
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,100
That was weird for everybody,

658
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,140
'Cause you accidentally hugged him instead of me.

659
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,610
Sir? sir!

660
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,100
Code: Did you find out who it was?

661
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:02,090
Oh,code: Get the car.

662
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,520
Code: Right away,sir.

663
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,580
- Bye-bye! - See you tomorrow,Hal.

664
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:16,060
I'll leave the door unlocked in case you want to check on me later.

665
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:22,460
Who is this man we've infused with godlike power?

666
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:29,010
Well,sir,his name's Hal Stewart. He's 28 years old.

667
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,790
No criminal record. Actually no records at all.

668
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,090
Apparently this man hasn't accomplished anything.

669
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:38,480
Not yet,Minion. Not... yet.

670
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,240
Could this day get anymore fun-tastic?

671
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,440
So,I will just go ahead and diffuse him

672
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,680
since this is clearly a mistake.

673
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:49,510
No,Minion! There's something much more powerful at work here.

674
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,870
This is no mistake. It's destiny.

675
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:58,870
Hal Shtewart! Prepare for your destiny!

676
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,380
Hal? Hal shtewart?

677
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,650
- Hey! In the bed! - Am I saying it right?

678
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:04,690
"Stewart."

679
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,810
Is this a robbery?

680
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:09,400
'Cause the lady across the hall has way better stuff than me.

681
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,660
Oh,look,it's Hal Stewart. Quick,the spray.

682
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,270
All out.

683
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,420
- Well,use the forget-me stick. - Oh,right.

684
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:21,800
Just look at him.

685
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:26,610
No,he doesn't look quite the hero-type to me.

686
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,450
Oh,you're such a pill,Minion.

687
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,600
A potter couldn't ask for finer clay.

688
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:34,130
I smell a hero.

689
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,600
I smell something burning.

690
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:39,040
I think it's working. Places! Places!

691
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,540
Places! Places! Places.

692
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:42,760
Do you have your disguise?

693
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:50,290
What?

694
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,420
Oh,you look fantastic.

695
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:04,860
Rise my glorious creation.

696
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,740
Rise,and come to papa.

697
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,740
- What's going on? - Easy my child.

698
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,680
- Who are you? - I sent you to this planet

699
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:17,610
To teach you about justice,honor,and nobility.

700
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,830
I am your father.

701
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,120
So you're like my space dad?

702
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,650
Yeah,I'm like your space dad.

703
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,490
And you are what?

704
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,360
I'm your space stepmom.

705
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,280
I've had some work done recently.

706
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,070
Is this some kind of dream?

707
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:39,280
This is a dream come true.

708
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:42,730
You've been blessed with unfathomable power.

709
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:44,940
- What kind of power? - Unfathomable.

710
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,230
It's unf... without fathom.

711
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,910
Yeah. we've come to guide you

712
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:54,580
on your path to be metrocity's new hero.

713
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:58,830
And battle the super-genius of megamind.

714
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,070
I know this is a lot to take in.

715
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,780
It may take months for you to come to grips.

716
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:08,260
No freaking way!

717
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:09,620
I wasn't finished.

718
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,420
I'm gonna be a hero!

719
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,510
I'm gonna be a hero!

720
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:22,090
See,Minion,he's perfect!

721
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,170
And... action!

722
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,500
- Someone help me! - I'm ok!

723
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,230
You... bad!

724
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,830
Zap! Zap! Zap!

725
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,680
The flames of my evil burn bright.

726
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,530
Now you say something cool back at me.

727
00:42:44,780 --> 00:42:47,390
Look. It doesn't even hurt. Don't even feel it.

728
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,960
No,no,no,no,no. Stomach down,hands up,

729
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,570
like metro man.

730
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:55,330
- Whoa! Wait! - Watch out.

731
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,670
He's hopeless. Hopeless!

732
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:03,500
- Maybe we should change tactics. - You think so?

733
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,470
Oh,you know how boys are.

734
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,070
They love video games.

735
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:09,510
- I could throw a few parts together. - Can't wait.

736
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,830
Lol. smiley face.

737
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,400
Can't wait for what,sir?

738
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:17,260
That was such a funny story.

739
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,130
And brilliantly told,by the way.

740
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:21,960
Ok,now you tell one.

741
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:24,400
Bernard,I never knew you were so funny.

742
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,950
And I never heard you laugh before.

743
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,040
Yeah,it's been a while. Feels pretty good.

744
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,890
And action.

745
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:51,120
- You don't get out much,do you? - Oh,what fun!

746
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:55,640
I used to come here with my mother when I was a kid.

747
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,390
It was one of my favorite things to do.

748
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:01,580
Now look at it. It's a dump.

749
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,300
Why are we cleaning up the city,sir?

750
00:44:08,530 --> 00:44:12,480
Well,we don't want to battle our new hero in a dump now,

751
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:13,610
do we?

752
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,520
They're all back. But how? why?

753
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:22,890
Maybe megamind isn't so bad after all.

754
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,420
That's it.

755
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,660
Be free,my beautiful dove!

756
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:38,670
Ok,ok.

757
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:42,540
Metro man and I were never a couple.

758
00:44:42,770 --> 00:44:43,850
But I thought you two were...

759
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:44,920
I know,everybody did.

760
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,530
It's just... well,he was never really my type.

761
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:48,600
Really?

762
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,170
Ok,now you tell me something.

763
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,140
Something you've never told anyone.

764
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,360
Well,in sh... school...

765
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:02,290
...none of the other kids really liked me.

766
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,690
I was always the last one picked for everything.

767
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:10,020
It's too bad that we didn't go to the same school.

768
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:18,500
Hal,I think you're ready for this.

769
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,550
- Do I have a son? - No.

770
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,090
You make me laugh.

771
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:27,090
It stretches. It's for you.

772
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:30,360
Hey,what's the t stand for?

773
00:45:30,610 --> 00:45:31,760
Titan.

774
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:34,110
"Titan"? What's that supposed to mean?

775
00:45:34,330 --> 00:45:36,860
It was the only name I could trademark.

776
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,630
Do you have someone special in your life,Hal?

777
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:46,010
No,not yet. but... there's this really,really good-looking one

778
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,200
I've got my eye on currently.

779
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,170
That's very good.

780
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,100
Romance is very inspiring.

781
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,320
That's what I hear.

782
00:45:58,530 --> 00:46:01,150
All you have to do is save her

783
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,310
and she'll be yours.

784
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,850
- Who wants churros? - I do!

785
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,330
I do,yeah. thanks,space stepmom.

786
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:07,220
Churros all the way around.

787
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,900
On the count of three,unsheathe your churro.

788
00:46:11,150 --> 00:46:12,600
One,two,three!

789
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:13,900
To titan!

790
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,010
Tomorrow,you will fight megamind,

791
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,540
and the city will know your name.

792
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:23,970
The city's parks restored to their original glory,

793
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:28,070
The streets the safest they've been,the banks reopened.

794
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,140
Has something happened to megamind?

795
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:32,930
Has someone tamed this monster?

796
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,850
This is Roxanne Ritchi,

797
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,540
cautiously optimistic,and pleasantly confused.

798
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:40,930
Well,you seem in a very good mood tonight,sir.

799
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:44,590
Oh,yes. how long is this going to take,Minion?

800
00:46:44,850 --> 00:46:46,090
Just a few alterations,sir,

801
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:49,210
and I will be done with your most terrifying cape yet!

802
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:50,680
I'm calling it...

803
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:55,070
...the black mamba...

804
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:56,820
Black mamba. perfect.

805
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,670
Gosh,I am running late. I have to go.

806
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,940
What? Where... where are you going,sir?

807
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,250
We have our debut battle with titan tomorrow morning.

808
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,500
We haven't even tested your big battle suit yet.

809
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:08,100
You attend to the details,Minion.

810
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:10,570
I have to... run a quick errand.

811
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,440
You don't run errands.

812
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,440
- What's going on here? - What?

813
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,030
Oh,wait a minute.

814
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,490
Are you wearing Jean Paul Gaultier's pour homme?

815
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:23,960
It's just my natural musk. Now,where are the car keys?

816
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,570
This is about Ms. Ritchi,isn't it?

817
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,280
You're going on a date with her.

818
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,980
No,my main man. Get out of town.

819
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:38,490
Oh,this is bad. This is bad. You've fallen in love with her.

820
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:40,770
You are forgetting your place,Minion.

821
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:42,300
Now give me the keys.

822
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:47,190
What happens when Roxanne finds out who you really are?

823
00:47:47,530 --> 00:47:49,240
She will never find out,

824
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,290
that's the point of lying.

825
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:54,720
Honestly,if I didn't know any better,

826
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,000
I'd think this was your first day of being evil.

827
00:47:57,220 --> 00:47:58,010
No!

828
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:01,380
This has gone far enough!

829
00:48:02,870 --> 00:48:04,620
Oh,that was really grown-up!

830
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,310
Sir,sir,please. it's for your own good.

831
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:10,870
Oh,what do you know?

832
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:12,010
I may not know much,

833
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:16,200
But I know this,the bad guy doesn't get the girl.

834
00:48:16,410 --> 00:48:18,960
Maybe I don't want to be the bad guy anymore.

835
00:48:22,870 --> 00:48:23,760
You heard me!

836
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,200
Who are you?

837
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,080
- now,give me the keys! - no!

838
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,840
My sole purpose in life is to look after you.

839
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:34,860
Well,I don't need you to look after me.

840
00:48:35,110 --> 00:48:38,560
What are you s... what are you saying? you don't need me?

841
00:48:38,780 --> 00:48:42,140
Let me make it clear. Code: I don't need you.

842
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:43,970
You know what? You know what?

843
00:48:47,010 --> 00:48:49,310
Code: I'll just pack my thing and go!

844
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:52,000
- Code: Fine!  - Code: fine back!

845
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:58,270
- Well,good luck on your date! - I will!

846
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:00,920
- That doesn't even make any sense! - I know!

847
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,720
I know I am so close. I can feel it.

848
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:41,870
Ok,ok. I just have to take a step back.

849
00:49:48,140 --> 00:49:49,130
Wait a minute.

850
00:50:02,130 --> 00:50:03,340
"Titan."

851
00:50:04,430 --> 00:50:08,540
- what's a Titan? - my super-ears are burning.

852
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,180
I usually just hear criminals. You haven't been naughty,have you?

853
00:50:14,190 --> 00:50:16,240
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing with you.

854
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,290
- The name's Titan. - Titan.

855
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,810
Your very own heroic guardian of pure awesome.

856
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:23,010
What's your name? Just kidding.

857
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:24,140
I know everything about you.

858
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,120
And I... and I brought some flowers.

859
00:50:27,370 --> 00:50:30,710
Didn't know what you liked,so I just grabbed,you know,all of them.

860
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:35,290
Ok,you don't like flowers? Ok,forget the flowers.

861
00:50:35,530 --> 00:50:36,280
What do you want?

862
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,700
Thought maybe we could go for a little flight around town.

863
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:39,890
Get to know each other first.

864
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,230
This must be very thrilling for you.

865
00:50:43,470 --> 00:50:44,510
What do you think you're doing?!

866
00:50:44,730 --> 00:50:46,850
Oh,am I moving too fast? you're probably right.

867
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:49,910
I should just rescue you a few times before we get all romantic.

868
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:52,510
Saved ya.

869
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,110
You are lucky to have such a great hero here.

870
00:50:55,370 --> 00:50:57,840
- Don't you ever... - Oh,no! Somebody do something!

871
00:50:58,140 --> 00:51:00,910
Oh,right,right,duh. I gotcha. I gotcha.

872
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,520
That was a close one. You almost died,

873
00:51:08,850 --> 00:51:10,440
- But I saved you. - Building!

874
00:51:15,870 --> 00:51:19,200
Gotcha! I'm sorry. What were you saying?

875
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,600
I couldn't hear you over the sound of me saving your life.

876
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:23,210
Put me down! right now!

877
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:25,670
Ok,all right,all right,hold on.

878
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:29,760
Are you crazy?

879
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,770
I suppose I'm a,I'm a little crazy,about you.

880
00:51:33,210 --> 00:51:35,480
Who are you,really?

881
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,020
Oh,right. Well,prepare to have your mind blown,little lady.

882
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:43,280
- Ta-da. - Hal?

883
00:51:43,550 --> 00:51:45,850
Yeah. Isn't this great?

884
00:51:46,130 --> 00:51:47,970
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

885
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:51,280
- No,it's not great. - Wow,our first fight.

886
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:52,850
This is so us.

887
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:54,330
We're like an old married couple.

888
00:51:54,570 --> 00:51:55,760
Look,there is no "us," ok?

889
00:51:55,990 --> 00:51:57,570
There will never be an "us."

890
00:51:57,840 --> 00:52:00,050
But... I have powers.

891
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:02,450
I have a cape. I'm the good guy.

892
00:52:02,710 --> 00:52:05,160
You are a good guy,Hal,but you don't understand.

893
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:07,260
- We need to find out why... - No,no. this...

894
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:08,500
- Hal,just take a deep breath - This isn't right!

895
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,810
- And listen to me for a moment. - You're supposed to be with me!

896
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:13,060
I'm trying to warn you,Hal.

897
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,020
It's Titan! It's Titan,not Hal!

898
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,100
- Bernard. - Roxanne.

899
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,920
Sorry I'm late.

900
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:45,770
Wow,your hair looks exciting.

901
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,960
Not the only exciting development of the night.

902
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:51,210
Megamind's created a new hero,

903
00:52:51,620 --> 00:52:52,760
and I know why.

904
00:52:54,220 --> 00:52:57,150
It all makes sense now. He missed getting his butt kicked,

905
00:52:57,420 --> 00:52:58,520
So he created a new hero

906
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:00,120
- to kick it for him. - Yeah.

907
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:02,710
But why would he pick Hal?

908
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,740
Hal is the worst possible person you could pick.

909
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:07,980
Wow. That's a lot to take in.

910
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:10,090
It boggles my mind.

911
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:13,490
I am extremely boggled. You know,I'm sure we'll get

912
00:53:13,750 --> 00:53:15,580
To the bottom of who's kicking whose butt.

913
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:19,590
But in the meantime,let's enjoy each other's company.

914
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,940
I'm sorry,Bernard,of course,you're right.

915
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,550
You know,I could use a breather.

916
00:53:26,050 --> 00:53:27,030
To Bernard,

917
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:31,700
for being the only normal thing in my crazy,upside-down world.

918
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:35,630
To... being normal.

919
00:53:45,460 --> 00:53:47,000
- Roxanne? - Yes?

920
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:50,600
Say I wasn't so normal.

921
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:55,290
Let's say I was bald and had the complexion of,

922
00:53:55,550 --> 00:54:00,040
Of a popular primary color,as a random,nonspecific example.

923
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,030
- Would you still enjoy my company? - Of course!

924
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,700
You don't judge a book by its cover

925
00:54:05,950 --> 00:54:07,400
or a person from the outside.

926
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,330
That's a relief to hear.

927
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,360
You judge them based on their actions.

928
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,430
Well,that seems kind of petty,don't you think?

929
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:45,600
What? What?

930
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:50,440
Don't look at me! Just a technical glitch!

931
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,350
Don't look yet! Well,never mind that.

932
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:55,690
Ok.

933
00:54:57,420 --> 00:54:58,410
Where were we?

934
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,840
- You... - Now,now,hold on.

935
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:03,960
You!

936
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:26,560
I can explain!

937
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:30,190
What about everything you just said?

938
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:32,560
About judging a book by its cover?

939
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,770
Well,let's take a look at the contents then,shall we?

940
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:39,100
You destroyed Metroman,you took over the city,

941
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:43,000
And then,you actually got me to care about you!

942
00:55:44,080 --> 00:55:47,840
Why are you so evil? Tricking me?

943
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,150
What could you possibly hope to gain?

944
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,000
Wait a minute. I don't believe this.

945
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:06,760
Do you really think that I would ever be with you?

946
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,560
No.

947
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,590
Ok,Minion! You were right!

948
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:49,630
I was... less right!

949
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,590
We should stick to what we're good at... being bad.

950
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,040
Minion?

951
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,290
You there!

952
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:18,760
Yeah,you.

953
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,570
Bring out the black mamba.

954
00:57:54,830 --> 00:57:58,990
Ok,Titan. it's time to go down in style.

955
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:26,370
I hear there's a new hero who dares challenge my evil.

956
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:29,630
Where is the one they call Titan?

957
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:36,050
CHallenge me if you dare!

958
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,570
Oh no. We're gonna crash!

959
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:06,150
This is embarrassing.

960
00:59:12,930 --> 00:59:16,360
Of all the inconsiderate,bone-headed...

961
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,050
...irresponsible,rude...

962
00:59:20,470 --> 00:59:22,820
Unprofessional,that's what this is!

963
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,830
Would Metro man have kept me waiting?

964
00:59:26,350 --> 00:59:28,390
Of course not! he was a pro!

965
00:59:28,700 --> 00:59:31,330
Hey,Megamind! You're actually the guy I want to see.

966
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,050
Also,there's a door here.

967
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:37,010
Do you have any idea how long I waited for you?

968
00:59:37,250 --> 00:59:38,730
No,no,no,I totally understand what you're saying.

969
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:40,040
Could you just,just shut up for one second.

970
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,340
I'm trying to beat this level.

971
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,500
Were you even planning on showing up?

972
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:45,240
What's this?

973
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,810
Where did you get all this stuff?

974
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,680
It doesn't belong to me.

975
00:59:51,910 --> 00:59:53,820
- You stole it? - Pretty cool,right?

976
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,500
No,no,no,no! you're a hero!

977
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,200
Being a hero is for losers!

978
00:59:57,430 --> 01:00:00,320
It's work,work,work,24/7,and for what?

979
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:02,410
I only took the gig to get the girl,

980
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,980
And it turns out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

981
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:08,030
- Roxanne Ritchi? - Yeah! Roxanne Ritchi!

982
01:00:08,260 --> 01:00:10,570
I saw her having dinner and making googly eyes

983
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:12,620
At some intellectual dweeb!

984
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,620
Who needs all that noise?

985
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,180
That's why I think we should team up.

986
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:19,870
You... wait... what?

987
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:22,120
With my power,and your big-headedness,

988
01:00:22,520 --> 01:00:25,650
- We could rule the city! - You want to team up?

989
01:00:25,870 --> 01:00:27,320
I even drew up some new costume designs,see?

990
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:28,870
- Costume designs? - You'd be the brains,

991
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:30,200
So you'd get a little brain,

992
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,920
Wearing glasses on your costume,or something.

993
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,110
And since I'm the cool one,I'd have,like,

994
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:36,320
Two tanks swordfighting...

995
01:00:37,270 --> 01:00:38,450
I can't believe you.

996
01:00:39,090 --> 01:00:41,900
All your gifts,all your powers,

997
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:45,590
And you... you squander them for your own personal gain.

998
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,460
- Yes! - No! I'm the villain!

999
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:50,800
You're the good guy! I do something bad,

1000
01:00:51,070 --> 01:00:54,640
And you come and get me! That's why I created you.

1001
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:58,490
Yeah,right. you're nuts. space dad told me...

1002
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,760
Look,I'm your space dad!

1003
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,320
You should be more like Metro man.

1004
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,560
-You tricked me? - Oh,don't like that?

1005
01:01:08,780 --> 01:01:09,720
Well,there's more.

1006
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:15,100
I'm also the intellectual dweeb dating Roxanne.

1007
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:19,200
- No. - And we were smooching up a storm!

1008
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:23,700
When I get my hands on you,I'm gonna...

1009
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,700
Yes! Yes,I know! Bring me to justice.

1010
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,460
Oh god,how I've missed this.

1011
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:34,890
And the hero strikes the first blow.

1012
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,050
But evil returns with a backhand!

1013
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:42,930
Yes!

1014
01:01:51,970 --> 01:01:53,570
Come out,you little freak!

1015
01:01:54,070 --> 01:01:56,920
I want to see what that big brain looks like on the pavement!

1016
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:06,660
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book!

1017
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,300
You little blue twerp!

1018
01:02:11,730 --> 01:02:12,650
En garde!

1019
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:20,210
Oh,now that's the spirit!

1020
01:02:20,510 --> 01:02:22,690
Parry! Thrust! Parry again!

1021
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,940
Now it's time for some witty back and forth banter!

1022
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,480
You go first!

1023
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,950
Ok! look,I'm not sure where to go with that!

1024
01:02:32,700 --> 01:02:34,460
This one's for stealing my girlfriend!

1025
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:42,820
This one's for space dad making a fool out of me!

1026
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:55,160
And,Megamind,this one's for space stepmom! you lied to her!

1027
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,260
Well done. I thought that battle went really,really well.

1028
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:01,870
- I mean,I have a few notes. - Notes?

1029
01:03:02,110 --> 01:03:02,970
But they can wait.

1030
01:03:03,210 --> 01:03:04,160
You can take me to jail now.

1031
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:08,050
Oh,no,no,no. I was thinking more like the morgue. You're dead!

1032
01:03:08,290 --> 01:03:10,500
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa. This isn't how you play the game.

1033
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:11,630
Game over.

1034
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:19,610
Brain-bots!

1035
01:03:25,790 --> 01:03:26,870
I'm calling time out!

1036
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,280
Time out? time out! time out!

1037
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:43,280
Brain-bots,initiate the fail-safe.

1038
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:54,490
Guess what,Buster Brown? it's made from copper.

1039
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:56,470
You're powerless against it.

1040
01:03:56,710 --> 01:04:00,640
It's the very same metal used to defeat... Metro man?

1041
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:04,770
You should stop comparing me to Metro man!

1042
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:16,580
You can run,Megamind,but you can't hide!

1043
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:18,570
We're saved! we're saved!

1044
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:20,660
What's your name,new hero?

1045
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:22,570
- It's Titan. - Thank you!

1046
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,550
Thank you! Titan has freed us!

1047
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:27,450
Oh,I wouldn't say "free."

1048
01:04:27,720 --> 01:04:30,470
More like under new management.

1049
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:38,280
- What do you want? - Titan's turned evil.

1050
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:39,170
Congratulations.

1051
01:04:39,190 --> 01:04:41,150
Another one of your genius plans has backfired on you.

1052
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:43,600
And why did my doorman let you up?

1053
01:04:45,010 --> 01:04:45,840
Carlos.

1054
01:04:46,560 --> 01:04:48,030
Please,Roxanne,no. no.

1055
01:04:48,580 --> 01:04:49,500
I need your help.

1056
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,640
Why do you need my help?

1057
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:55,640
Because you're the smartest person I know.

1058
01:04:57,750 --> 01:04:58,730
But you can't hide here.

1059
01:04:58,960 --> 01:04:59,660
The copper should have worked.

1060
01:04:59,890 --> 01:05:01,060
Why didn't the copper work?

1061
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:02,790
The copper worked perfectly well last time.

1062
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,790
Copper? you're not making any sense.

1063
01:05:05,020 --> 01:05:06,850
Look,if we don't find Titan's weakness,

1064
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:08,510
He'll destroy the whole city.

1065
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,800
Ok,how can I help?

1066
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:14,130
We need to find answers.

1067
01:05:14,360 --> 01:05:15,940
You knew Metro man best.

1068
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:17,890
Did he have a hideout? A cave?

1069
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:22,310
A solitary fortress of some kind? Anything that would give us clues.

1070
01:05:22,750 --> 01:05:25,230
Well... there is one place I know.

1071
01:05:28,040 --> 01:05:30,620
You gave him these powers. can't you just take them away?

1072
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:33,470
I can't. I lost my diffuser gun

1073
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:35,400
when I misplaced the invisible car.

1074
01:05:36,050 --> 01:05:37,000
The night you dumped me,

1075
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:40,260
alone,in the rain.

1076
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:42,980
Did you ever look back?

1077
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,350
- No! - My giant blue head!

1078
01:05:46,590 --> 01:05:47,620
I guess we're here.

1079
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:53,530
So,this is where he hid it.

1080
01:05:53,780 --> 01:05:58,210
After all these years. My old shoolhouse.

1081
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:03,610
You know,I think there's an apology in order for the other night.

1082
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,730
Ok,that would be nice,but make it quick.

1083
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:07,880
We have much more pressing matters to deal with.

1084
01:06:11,910 --> 01:06:16,270
Wow. I can't believe he kept all this stuff.

1085
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,510
I remember when he wore that.

1086
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:20,850
Shouldn't we try to stay focused here?

1087
01:06:21,090 --> 01:06:23,000
Yes,of course,right,focused.

1088
01:06:24,430 --> 01:06:26,020
Hey,come over and look at this.

1089
01:06:26,670 --> 01:06:28,240
What is it? What did you find?

1090
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:32,690
Look.

1091
01:06:33,190 --> 01:06:35,600
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1092
01:06:35,810 --> 01:06:37,890
Yes,that's what happens when water gets cold.

1093
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:41,510
No,what I'm saying is,don't you think it's a little odd

1094
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:43,840
That the ice hasn't melted yet?

1095
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:45,530
One of life's great mysteries.

1096
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:06,900
We now have confirmed reports.

1097
01:07:07,220 --> 01:07:09,460
Titan,first thought to be this city's new hero,

1098
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:10,800
has turned evil.

1099
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:13,660
The city has never seen this level of destruction.

1100
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,290
If only Metroman were still alive...

1101
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,800
- You're alive? - You're alive.

1102
01:07:19,060 --> 01:07:20,940
- I'm alive. - but I,we...

1103
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:23,510
We saw your skeleton! you were dead!

1104
01:07:23,750 --> 01:07:24,810
Are you a ghost?

1105
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,920
There had better be an amazing explanation for this.

1106
01:07:29,140 --> 01:07:31,100
Speak,apparition.

1107
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:43,570
Ok. ok,ok,ok.

1108
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:45,360
You both deserve the truth.

1109
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:47,780
It all started back at the observatory.

1110
01:07:48,930 --> 01:07:51,390
Roxanne was kidnapped. I was gonna stop you.

1111
01:07:52,670 --> 01:07:54,370
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1112
01:07:55,210 --> 01:07:57,140
We were kind of going through the motions.

1113
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:01,120
So... using my super-speed,

1114
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:02,770
I decided to go clear my head.

1115
01:08:03,110 --> 01:08:04,090
Fire!

1116
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,060
Then I realized,

1117
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,330
We had done this same silly charade our entire lives.

1118
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:13,680
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling,

1119
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:16,120
But I just felt stuck.

1120
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:20,530
I began to realize,despite all my powers,

1121
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,040
Each and every citizen of Metro have something I didn't,

1122
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:25,800
a choice.

1123
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:28,620
Ever since I can remember,

1124
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:31,010
I've always had to be what the city wanted me to be.

1125
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,940
But what about what I wanted to do?

1126
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,500
Then it suddenly hit me.

1127
01:08:38,210 --> 01:08:39,730
I do have a choice.

1128
01:08:41,210 --> 01:08:43,050
I can be whatever I want to be.

1129
01:08:43,730 --> 01:08:46,010
No one said this hero thing had to be a lifetime gig.

1130
01:08:47,010 --> 01:08:48,390
You can't just quit,either.

1131
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:53,960
That's when I got the brilliant idea... to fake my death.

1132
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,600
Copper drains my powers.

1133
01:08:57,830 --> 01:08:58,990
Your weakness is copper?

1134
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:04,570
Once your death ray hit,I'd never felt so alive.

1135
01:09:05,480 --> 01:09:07,820
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby nursing school.

1136
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:11,150
Metroman was finally dead.

1137
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:13,040
And music man was born!

1138
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:15,150
- Music man? - That way I could keep my logo.

1139
01:09:15,370 --> 01:09:16,300
- 'Cause of wha...? - Come again?

1140
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:20,150
I was finally free to get in touch with my true power...

1141
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:21,960
...weaving lyrical magic.

1142
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:23,810
Check this out.

1143
01:09:24,250 --> 01:09:27,360
I have eyes that can see

1144
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:31,240
right through lead...

1145
01:09:31,520 --> 01:09:33,640
- You're horrible! - Granted,you have talent.

1146
01:09:33,850 --> 01:09:37,130
But there's a madman out there destroying our... your city.

1147
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,530
How could you do this?!

1148
01:09:40,770 --> 01:09:42,350
The people of this city relied on you,

1149
01:09:42,570 --> 01:09:43,670
and you deserted them!

1150
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,770
You left us in the hands of him!

1151
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:48,930
- No offense. - No,I'm with you.

1152
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,100
Look,we need your help.

1153
01:09:51,630 --> 01:09:54,180
I'm sorry. I really am.

1154
01:09:55,270 --> 01:09:56,260
I'm done.

1155
01:09:56,970 --> 01:09:58,350
You know,little buddy,

1156
01:09:58,950 --> 01:10:00,450
there's a yin for every yang.

1157
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:03,940
If there's bad,good will rise up against it.

1158
01:10:04,790 --> 01:10:07,190
It's taken me a long time to find my calling.

1159
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:10,890
Now it's about time you find yours.

1160
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,810
Hey,who needs him?

1161
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:20,050
We can beat Titan ourselves.

1162
01:10:20,270 --> 01:10:23,120
I say we go back to the evil lair,grab some ray guns,

1163
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:25,810
Hold him sideways,and just go all gangsta on him.

1164
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:27,730
We can't.

1165
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,080
So that's it? you're just giving up?

1166
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,230
I'm the bad guy. I don't save the day,

1167
01:10:33,450 --> 01:10:35,160
I don't fly off into the sunset,

1168
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:37,430
And I don't get the girl.

1169
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:39,600
I'm going home.

1170
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:13,540
Unless someone comes to our aid soon,all may be lost.

1171
01:11:14,790 --> 01:11:17,830
Thousands have already fled the city in a mass exodus.

1172
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:22,130
Remaining citizens are warned to stay indoors until further notice.

1173
01:11:23,780 --> 01:11:25,380
Authorities have issued a warning

1174
01:11:25,610 --> 01:11:29,020
To stay out of the downtown area at all costs.

1175
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:42,040
Hal!

1176
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:44,220
Hal!

1177
01:11:46,190 --> 01:11:48,680
Let me guess. After seeing how awesome I am,

1178
01:11:48,990 --> 01:11:52,220
You've finally come to your senses? well,I'm over you.

1179
01:11:52,460 --> 01:11:55,810
- I've come to stop you,Hal. - You? oh,wow.

1180
01:11:56,030 --> 01:11:57,810
Ok,what are you gonna do,report me to death?

1181
01:11:58,030 --> 01:11:59,680
I was going to try reasoning with you.

1182
01:12:00,130 --> 01:12:02,680
You and I,we worked together for a long time.

1183
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,240
I know you.

1184
01:12:04,470 --> 01:12:07,840
You don't know me. You never took the time to know me.

1185
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,510
This is the first time we've hung out socially,

1186
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,600
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city!

1187
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:14,210
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1188
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,060
I want to talk to the guy who loved being a cameraman,

1189
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,340
And eating dip,and being a nerd,

1190
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:21,680
And being not as scary as the Tighten Hal.

1191
01:12:21,900 --> 01:12:23,020
Too late!

1192
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,320
... interrupting our scheduled...

1193
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:28,000
... extraordinary events taking place...

1194
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:29,840
Heat in the valley and...

1195
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,130
Megamind!

1196
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:36,300
You and I have some unfinished business.

1197
01:12:36,530 --> 01:12:38,020
I'll be waiting at metro tower.

1198
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:40,630
Oh,and just so you don't get cold feet...

1199
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:43,400
Roxanne.

1200
01:12:43,790 --> 01:12:44,910
Come on,Roxie,

1201
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,530
call for your hero to come rescue you.

1202
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:52,490
Megamind,I don't even know if you're listening,

1203
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:53,790
but if you are,

1204
01:12:54,290 --> 01:12:55,940
You can't give up.

1205
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:01,410
The Megamind I knew would never have run from a fight,

1206
01:13:01,690 --> 01:13:05,090
Even when he knew he had absolutely no chance of winning.

1207
01:13:05,470 --> 01:13:07,420
It was your best quality.

1208
01:13:07,930 --> 01:13:10,920
You need to be that guy right now.

1209
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,080
The city needs you.

1210
01:13:16,770 --> 01:13:17,940
I need you.

1211
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:19,650
Roxanne.

1212
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:21,070
You have one hour.

1213
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:23,720
Don't keep me waiting.

1214
01:13:25,770 --> 01:13:27,210
Warden! warden!

1215
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,560
listen to me! You have to let me go!

1216
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,710
Tighten has to be stopped!

1217
01:13:32,020 --> 01:13:32,950
Sorry,Megamind.

1218
01:13:33,150 --> 01:13:35,290
you still have 88 life sentences to go.

1219
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:37,980
Plenty of time to reflect on what you've done.

1220
01:13:38,250 --> 01:13:41,660
Did you want to hear me say it? I'll say it.

1221
01:13:41,950 --> 01:13:45,260
Here it is,from the blackest part of my heart.

1222
01:13:47,820 --> 01:13:50,790
I am sorry!

1223
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:54,960
Not buying it.

1224
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:58,790
I don't blame you.

1225
01:14:00,510 --> 01:14:02,840
I've terrorized this city countless times.

1226
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:06,300
Created a hero who's turned out to be a villain.

1227
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:09,610
I lied to Roxanne,and...

1228
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:12,180
...my best friend Minion,

1229
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:15,220
I treated like dirt.

1230
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:19,450
Please don't make this city...

1231
01:14:21,220 --> 01:14:24,250
...don't make Roxanne pay for my wrongdoings.

1232
01:14:28,510 --> 01:14:29,860
Apology accepted.

1233
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:36,680
Oh,Minion,you fantastic fish,you.

1234
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:39,700
What are we waiting for? We'd better get going.

1235
01:14:42,910 --> 01:14:43,840
You got me.

1236
01:14:47,010 --> 01:14:48,060
Good luck,fellas!

1237
01:14:48,290 --> 01:14:49,390
we're gonna die!

1238
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:51,960
Wait,what?

1239
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:55,880
Hey,Metro losers. This is Metro tower.

1240
01:14:56,390 --> 01:14:59,430
They say it's supposed to be a symbol of our city's strength.

1241
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:01,680
But for me,it's a reminder of the day

1242
01:15:01,900 --> 01:15:04,620
This woman ferociously ripped out my heart.

1243
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:06,970
And I hate reminders!

1244
01:15:20,480 --> 01:15:21,350
Help!

1245
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,930
Please don't do this.

1246
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,570
I know there's still good in you,Hal.

1247
01:15:27,810 --> 01:15:29,220
You're so naive,Roxie.

1248
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,170
You see the good in everybody,

1249
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:32,550
even when it's not there.

1250
01:15:32,930 --> 01:15:34,490
You're living a fantasy.

1251
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,080
There is no Easter Bunny,there is no Tooth Fairy,

1252
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:40,050
And there is no queen of England.

1253
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,910
This is the real world,and you need to wake up!

1254
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:59,260
You dare challenge Megamind?

1255
01:15:59,710 --> 01:16:02,440
This town isn't big enough for two super-villains!

1256
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:07,560
Oh,you're a villain all right! Just not a super one!

1257
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,400
Yeah? what's the difference?

1258
01:16:13,710 --> 01:16:14,960
Presentation!

1259
01:16:34,830 --> 01:16:37,780
- I knew you'd come back. - Well,that made one of us.

1260
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:09,270
- What's the plan? - Well,it mostly involves not dying.

1261
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,470
I like that plan.

1262
01:17:28,460 --> 01:17:29,380
Building!

1263
01:17:31,390 --> 01:17:33,030
Go faster! Make this thing go faster!

1264
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:36,020
I can't control it!

1265
01:17:51,820 --> 01:17:52,660
No.

1266
01:17:56,010 --> 01:17:57,010
Well,that was easy.

1267
01:17:57,680 --> 01:17:59,530
Looks like there's only one loose end now.

1268
01:18:10,770 --> 01:18:13,910
Please,let's have a little respect for public transportation.

1269
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:16,350
You came back!

1270
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,060
You were right,Roxanne.

1271
01:18:18,470 --> 01:18:19,870
I never should have left.

1272
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:22,290
I... I thought you were dead.

1273
01:18:22,500 --> 01:18:25,420
My death was... greatly exaggerated.

1274
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,830
So,you're the punk I've heard about.

1275
01:18:42,070 --> 01:18:45,250
I'm sorry. I did the best I could.

1276
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:48,910
I'm so proud of you.

1277
01:18:53,070 --> 01:18:53,980
Minion?

1278
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:56,460
Surprise!

1279
01:18:58,190 --> 01:18:59,950
He's the real hero.

1280
01:19:07,090 --> 01:19:08,010
Megamind.

1281
01:19:10,060 --> 01:19:10,990
Going somewhere?

1282
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,470
Besides jail?

1283
01:19:21,230 --> 01:19:22,880
No,not in the face,man. please.

1284
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,530
If you know what's good for you,Tighten,

1285
01:19:24,740 --> 01:19:26,240
you'll stay out of Metrocity!

1286
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:27,680
- You got it! - For good!

1287
01:20:03,260 --> 01:20:04,510
Pretty sneaky,sis.

1288
01:20:05,450 --> 01:20:06,480
But there's only one person

1289
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:08,470
I know who calls this town "Metrocity."

1290
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,050
You.

1291
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,100
Bet you think it's really funny?

1292
01:20:18,190 --> 01:20:19,970
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy?

1293
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:25,350
Well,you're not gonna be laughing for long.

1294
01:20:26,530 --> 01:20:27,560
The invisible car.

1295
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:29,780
Hey! Remember that night that I dumped you?

1296
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:32,760
You're bringing this up now?

1297
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,750
Well,I did look back!

1298
01:20:36,420 --> 01:20:38,750
You did? you did?

1299
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:42,340
Yes! And you should look back right now!

1300
01:20:43,930 --> 01:20:45,110
Oh,I get it!

1301
01:20:53,430 --> 01:20:55,760
This is the last time you make a fool out of me!

1302
01:20:56,720 --> 01:20:58,030
I made you a hero.

1303
01:20:58,460 --> 01:21:02,110
You did the fool thing all by yourself.

1304
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:10,310
You're so pathetic.

1305
01:21:10,690 --> 01:21:13,840
No matter what side you're on,you're always the loser.

1306
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:15,990
There's a benefit to losing.

1307
01:21:16,830 --> 01:21:18,470
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1308
01:21:24,030 --> 01:21:25,750
Oh,you've got to be kidding me!

1309
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:27,080
Minion,if I live,

1310
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:28,170
I will kill you.

1311
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:40,370
Enjoy your flight!

1312
01:21:42,780 --> 01:21:43,630
Megamind!

1313
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:53,910
So this is how it ends.

1314
01:21:55,050 --> 01:21:58,470
Normally,I'd chalk this up to my last glorious failure.

1315
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,430
But not today.

1316
01:22:02,460 --> 01:22:05,410
What can I say? Old habits die hard.

1317
01:22:12,580 --> 01:22:14,040
Say bye-bye,Roxie.

1318
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,660
The thing about bad guys,they always lose!

1319
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:39,510
You did it. You won.

1320
01:22:40,900 --> 01:22:44,680
I finally had a reason to win. You.

1321
01:22:53,970 --> 01:22:54,970
Minion!

1322
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,470
Can't see. it's cold and... warm,and dark and light.

1323
01:22:59,680 --> 01:23:01,790
It's me,Minion. I'm right here.

1324
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:04,960
We've had a lot of adventures together,you and I.

1325
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,500
We have,Minion.

1326
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:13,510
I mean... most of them ended in horrible failure,

1327
01:23:13,730 --> 01:23:17,920
But we won today. didn't we,sir?

1328
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:20,320
Yes,Minion,we did it.

1329
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:21,950
Thanks to you.

1330
01:23:22,190 --> 01:23:25,790
Code: We're the good guys now.

1331
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:29,280
Code: I guess we are.

1332
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:33,640
Oh,oh,oh,I'm going! I think this,this is it!

1333
01:23:33,830 --> 01:23:35,540
I'm going... going far...

1334
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:48,430
What a drama queen.

1335
01:23:49,220 --> 01:23:52,580
You know,I'm feeling much better now. I guess I just needed a swim.

1336
01:23:52,820 --> 01:23:53,780
He had you,didn't he?

1337
01:23:54,610 --> 01:23:56,710
Classic Minion. Don't give me that face.

1338
01:23:57,170 --> 01:23:58,420
He reels you in with that little face.

1339
01:23:58,650 --> 01:24:00,400
- Look at that face. - We did it!

1340
01:24:00,970 --> 01:24:01,860
We did it!

1341
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:03,850
- Fist pump! - You did it!

1342
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,810
We won,we won,we won!

1343
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:10,030
Get back,you savages!

1344
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:14,060
Sorry! Sorry. He's just not used to positive feedback.

1345
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:18,340
Funny,

1346
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:21,090
I guess destiny is not the path given to us...

1347
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,940
... but the path we choose for ourselves.

1348
01:24:35,130 --> 01:24:37,450
All right,put your hands in the air.

1349
01:24:41,110 --> 01:24:42,560
Now hand over your wallets.

1350
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:45,350
I'm just kidding!

1351
01:24:46,640 --> 01:24:47,510
Just kidding!

1352
01:24:47,890 --> 01:24:51,910
I have to admit,being good has its perks.

1353
01:24:53,270 --> 01:24:55,720
You know,you look pretty good in white.

1354
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:58,260
Megamind,if you plea...

1355
01:25:03,880 --> 01:25:05,480
Hey. My kid can't see.

1356
01:25:06,230 --> 01:25:07,370
Sorry,my friend.

1357
01:25:08,390 --> 01:25:11,670
Way to go,little buddy. I knew he had it in him.

1358
01:25:11,990 --> 01:25:13,500
Ladies and gentlemen,

1359
01:25:14,070 --> 01:25:17,920
Megamind,defender of Metro city!

1360
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:22,910
You know,I like the sound of that.

1361
01:25:23,510 --> 01:25:24,290
Hit it!

1362
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:37,440
Megamind! Megamind! Megamind! Megamind!

1363
01:25:43,970 --> 01:25:48,250
I'm bad! I'm bad! that's right. yeah!

1364
01:28:34,080 --> 01:28:37,250
Sir,you really need to empty your pockets more often.

1365
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:40,550
This has been the worst day of my entire life.

1366
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:42,460
No worries.
