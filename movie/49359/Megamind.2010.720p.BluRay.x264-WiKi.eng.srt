1
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:40,814
Here's my day, so far.

2
00:00:40,815 --> 00:00:44,893
Went to jail, lost the girl of my
dreams and got my butt kicked.

3
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:46,126
Pretty good.

4
00:00:46,669 --> 00:00:49,745
Still, things could be a lot worse.

5
00:00:50,642 --> 00:00:54,637
Oh, that's right, I'm falling
to my death.

6
00:00:55,329 --> 00:00:56,785
Guess they can't.

7
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:59,406
How did it all come
to this, you ask?

8
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:02,419
My end starts at the beginning.

9
00:01:02,778 --> 00:01:04,638
The very beginning.

10
00:01:08,295 --> 00:01:10,051
Yes, that's me.

11
00:01:10,787 --> 00:01:13,676
I had a fairly standard childhood.

12
00:01:14,566 --> 00:01:17,629
I came from what you might call,
a broken home.

13
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,034
Literally, broken.

14
00:01:21,038 --> 00:01:24,258
I was eight days old and still living
with my parents.

15
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,305
How sad is that?

16
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,799
Clearly it was time to move on.

17
00:01:28,803 --> 00:01:32,047
Here is your, Minion, he will take care of you.

18
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:33,808
And here is your binkie.

19
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:37,024
You are destined for ...

20
00:01:37,029 --> 00:01:38,838
I didn't quite hear that last part.

21
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,479
But it sounded important.

22
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:43,210
Destined for, what?

23
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,994
I set out to find my destiny.

24
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:53,671
Turns out a kid from the Blaupunkt
quadrant had the exact same idea.

25
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:03,876
That was the day I met,
Mr. Goody-two-shoes.

26
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:11,305
And our glorious rivalry,
was born!

27
00:02:16,022 --> 00:02:18,424
Could this be what I was destined for?

28
00:02:18,811 --> 00:02:21,297
A dream life filled with luxury?

29
00:02:23,379 --> 00:02:24,602
Apparently not.

30
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,492
Even fate picks its favorites.

31
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:30,457
No big deal.

32
00:02:30,837 --> 00:02:33,824
A much different fate awaited me.

33
00:02:41,755 --> 00:02:43,085
A baby.

34
00:02:43,348 --> 00:02:44,717
How thoughtful.

35
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:48,116
Oh yes, yes. I saw it and thought of you.

36
00:02:48,677 --> 00:02:51,905
Luckily I found a lovely little
place to call home.

37
00:02:52,014 --> 00:02:53,329
Can we keep it?

38
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:57,389
A place that taught me the
differences between right...

39
00:02:57,586 --> 00:02:59,117
...and wrong.

40
00:02:59,586 --> 00:03:02,080
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes on the other hand,

41
00:03:02,084 --> 00:03:04,654
had life handed to him on a silver platter.

42
00:03:04,658 --> 00:03:06,081
Our baby can fly.

43
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:09,608
Yes, yes. Nothing but the best for you, Darling.

44
00:03:09,615 --> 00:03:14,014
The power of flight, invulnerability, and great hair.

45
00:03:14,973 --> 00:03:17,920
But I had something far, far greater,

46
00:03:17,924 --> 00:03:19,552
My amazing intellect.

47
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,729
A knack for building objects of mayhem.

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,088
After a few years, and with some time
off for good behavior.

49
00:03:32,715 --> 00:03:36,417
I was given an opportunity to better
myself through learning.

50
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:40,114
At a strange place called shh-ool.

51
00:03:40,444 --> 00:03:44,520
It was there that I once again ran into
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes.

52
00:03:44,546 --> 00:03:48,623
He had already amassed a gigantic army of
soft-headed groupies.

53
00:03:55,111 --> 00:04:00,064
He bought their affections with showmanship,
and extravagant gifts of deliciousness.

54
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:07,025
So I too would make this 'popped-corn'
and win over those mindless dregs.

55
00:04:07,033 --> 00:04:08,045
Lights out!

56
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:28,514
That's when I learned a very hard lesson.

57
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:31,349
Good receives all the praise and adulation.

58
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,373
While evil is sent to quiet time in the corner.

59
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,049
So a fitting end wasn't really an option.

60
00:04:39,356 --> 00:04:42,683
While they were learning the itsy
bitsy spider.

61
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,401
I learned how to dehydrate
animate objects.

62
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:47,370
and rehydrate them at will.

63
00:04:48,434 --> 00:04:53,450
Some day’s it felt like it was just me and Minion,
against the world.

64
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,599
No matter how hard I tried.

65
00:04:56,603 --> 00:04:58,788
I was always the odd man out.

66
00:04:58,792 --> 00:05:00,662
The last one picked.

67
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,195
The screw-up, the black sheep.

68
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:06,448
The bad boy.

69
00:05:14,316 --> 00:05:15,319
Oh!

70
00:05:17,690 --> 00:05:19,477
Was this my destiny?

71
00:05:19,839 --> 00:05:22,523
Wait! Maybe it was.

72
00:05:23,363 --> 00:05:26,338
Being bad is the one thing
I'm good at.

73
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,238
Then it hit me.

74
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:30,847
If I was the bad boy.

75
00:05:30,851 --> 00:05:34,882
Then I was going to be the baddest
boy of them all.

76
00:05:36,615 --> 00:05:38,765
I was destined to be a super villain.

77
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:42,116
And we were destined to be rivals.

78
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:45,185
The die had been cast.

79
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:49,456
And so began an enduring epic,
life long career.

80
00:05:49,465 --> 00:05:51,702
And I loved it.

81
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,175
Our battles quickly got more elaborate.

82
00:05:56,306 --> 00:06:00,928
He would win some, I would almost
win others.

83
00:06:01,081 --> 00:06:03,706
He took the name, Metro Man.

84
00:06:03,714 --> 00:06:05,909
Defender of Montrosity.

85
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:08,629
I decided to pick something a
little more humble.

86
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:09,699
Megamind.

87
00:06:10,132 --> 00:06:14,598
Incredibly handsome criminal genius,
and master of all villainy.

88
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:28,356
Read on your own time. Open up.

89
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:36,005
Hey!

90
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:37,052
BOO!!

91
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,241
Oh, good morning, Warden.

92
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:44,885
Great news, I'm a changed man.

93
00:06:44,886 --> 00:06:48,928
And I'm ready to re-enter society
as a solid citizen.

94
00:06:48,931 --> 00:06:51,684
You're a villain, and you'll always
be a villain.

95
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:53,051
You'll never change.

96
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:54,656
And you'll never leave.

97
00:06:54,657 --> 00:06:57,608
-You're fun.
-You got a present in the mail.

98
00:06:57,609 --> 00:06:59,268
Is it a puppy?

99
00:06:59,276 --> 00:07:04,007
From Metro Man. To count every second
of your 85 life sentences.

100
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:07,192
That's funny, never thought Metro Man
was the gloating type.

101
00:07:07,442 --> 00:07:09,070
Oh but he does have nice taste.

102
00:07:09,072 --> 00:07:10,472
I think I'll keep it.

103
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,490
Any chance you could give me the time?

104
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:15,787
I don't want to be late for the opening
of the Metro Man museum.

105
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,416
Oh no, looks like you're
gonna miss it.

106
00:07:19,417 --> 00:07:21,504
By several thousand years.

107
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,863
Oh, am I?

108
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:32,118
Happy Metro Man day, Metro City.

109
00:07:34,568 --> 00:07:40,120
It's a beautiful day in beautiful downtown where
we're here to honor a beautiful man.

110
00:07:40,288 --> 00:07:41,896
Metro Man.

111
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:46,269
His heart is an ocean that's inside
a bigger ocean.

112
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,571
For years he's been watching us
with his super-vision.

113
00:07:49,852 --> 00:07:54,519
Saving us with his super strength,
and caring for us with his super heart.

114
00:07:54,523 --> 00:07:57,166
Now it's our turn to give something back.

115
00:07:57,638 --> 00:08:02,141
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting live, from
the dedication of the Metro Man Museum.

116
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:05,032
Wow, okay, the stuff they make
you read on the air.

117
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:07,422
That's unfreaking believable, it's crazy.

118
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,243
I wrote that piece myself, Hal.

119
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:11,385
What I was trying to say was,

120
00:08:11,386 --> 00:08:17,100
I can't believe that in our modern society
they let like actual art get onto the news.

121
00:08:17,101 --> 00:08:20,369
-Nice save, Hal.
-What are we, like lets just get
a coffee or something.

122
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,459
Come on, it's time to get in the
Metro Man day spirit.

123
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:27,097
Well, if I were Metro Man Megamind
wouldn't be kidnapping you all the time.

124
00:08:27,098 --> 00:08:28,467
That's the first thing.

125
00:08:28,871 --> 00:08:29,922
That's sweet of you.

126
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:33,090
And I'd be watching you, like
a dingo watches a human baby.

127
00:08:33,091 --> 00:08:35,672
-Mmm.
-Okay, that sounded, Okay that
sounded a little weird.

128
00:08:35,673 --> 00:08:36,875
A little bit, yeah.

129
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,358
And you're making a weird face,
and that's making me feel weird.

130
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:45,399
Not love, we're not in love.
I'm not saying I love you.

131
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,009
Okay, I love you, whatever.
I'm not saying like I'm in love with you.

132
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:51,815
I'm saying...Roxanne?
Roxaroo?

133
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,102
Get back to work.

134
00:09:08,272 --> 00:09:10,288
The city doesn't pay you to loaf.

135
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,056
-Freeze!
-Whoa, what are you doing, guys?

136
00:09:12,057 --> 00:09:14,160
It's ME! It's the Warden.

137
00:09:14,826 --> 00:09:16,153
Hey, open up.

138
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,394
Oh, you fools. He's tricked us.

139
00:09:26,395 --> 00:09:27,947
You were right.

140
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:31,152
I'll always be a villain.

141
00:09:31,621 --> 00:09:34,790
<i>*George Thorogood's 'Bad to the Bone'*</i>

142
00:09:36,129 --> 00:09:40,590
<i>*Bad to the bone.
Bad to the bone.*</i>

143
00:09:40,591 --> 00:09:45,495
<i>*B..B..B..Bad.
B..B..B..Bad.*</i>

144
00:09:45,499 --> 00:09:49,030
<i>*Bad to the bone.*</i>

145
00:09:49,141 --> 00:09:51,603
Well hello good looking, need a lift?

146
00:09:51,613 --> 00:09:54,048
Certainly do, you fantastic fish you.

147
00:09:54,049 --> 00:09:55,938
Get in the car, you.

148
00:09:56,118 --> 00:09:57,714
Whoo, I'm free.

149
00:09:59,544 --> 00:10:01,673
Thanks for sending me the watch, Minion.

150
00:10:01,674 --> 00:10:02,895
You got it, boss.

151
00:10:03,595 --> 00:10:04,647
Punch it.

152
00:10:05,596 --> 00:10:08,481
All right, put your hands in the air.

153
00:10:12,555 --> 00:10:16,089
Ladies and gentlemen, your Metro Man.

154
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,364
-Who's your Man?
-Metro man.

155
00:10:19,768 --> 00:10:22,558
Yeah, Metro City!

156
00:10:25,118 --> 00:10:28,423
Give me some, come on give it now.
Give it to me. What?

157
00:10:28,428 --> 00:10:30,323
Give it to me...all right!

158
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:35,994
Yo, hey, ha, ha yo.

159
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,424
Hey, Metro city.

160
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,285
Hello, hey.

161
00:10:53,664 --> 00:10:55,939
You know, I just want you to bring it down a bit.

162
00:10:56,185 --> 00:10:57,312
Boys, a little lower.

163
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:58,715
Thank you fellows.

164
00:10:58,716 --> 00:11:01,148
Let's get real for a moment.

165
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:04,244
That's right, that's right
ha, ha, that's right.

166
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:06,835
Although getting a whole museum is super cool.

167
00:11:06,836 --> 00:11:11,123
Super cool, you want to know what the
greatest honor you've given me is?

168
00:11:11,388 --> 00:11:12,802
Do you really want to know?

169
00:11:13,237 --> 00:11:14,336
Really?

170
00:11:15,214 --> 00:11:16,555
I'll tell you.

171
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:19,433
The greatest honor you've given me is...

172
00:11:19,434 --> 00:11:21,274
...letting me serve you.

173
00:11:21,504 --> 00:11:23,084
To help these people in Metro city.

174
00:11:23,331 --> 00:11:24,741
And at the end of every day.

175
00:11:24,816 --> 00:11:26,235
Well.

176
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,078
I often ask myself.

177
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:32,273
Who would I be, without you?

178
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,285
I love you Metro Man!

179
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:35,110
And I love you, random citizen.

180
00:11:43,025 --> 00:11:47,210
I tell you Minion, there's no
place like evil lair.

181
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:50,762
I kept it cold and damp, just for you, sir.

182
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:53,146
How do I look, Minion?

183
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:56,268
-Do I look bad?
-Disgustingly horrifying, sir.

184
00:11:56,269 --> 00:11:57,955
You always know what to say.

185
00:11:57,956 --> 00:12:00,223
All the brain-bots certainly missed you, sir.

186
00:12:00,224 --> 00:12:02,856
Did you miss your daddy?
Whose the menacing little brains?

187
00:12:02,858 --> 00:12:06,845
You are, yes you are. Uh, uh!
No biting, no, no, no.

188
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:10,979
-No, no, no. You want the wrench?
Go get the wrench.
-Oh, look at that.

189
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,520
Now, back to work.

190
00:12:22,543 --> 00:12:24,847
She's awake,
Quick, to work.

191
00:12:35,192 --> 00:12:39,421
-Miss Ritchi, we meet again.
-Would it kill you to wash the bag?

192
00:12:39,422 --> 00:12:43,557
You can scream all you wish, Miss Ritchi.
I'm afraid no one can hear you.

193
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,008
Wha..why isn't she screaming?

194
00:12:47,009 --> 00:12:49,366
Miss Ritchi, if you don't mind.

195
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,121
Like this...AHHHHH!

196
00:12:51,122 --> 00:12:52,824
That's, that's a poor ladies scream.

197
00:12:52,829 --> 00:12:55,483
-AHHHHH!!!
-It's a little better.

198
00:12:58,525 --> 00:13:01,060
Is there some kind of nerdy super villain website,

199
00:13:01,061 --> 00:13:04,353
where you get Tesla coils, and blinky dials?

200
00:13:04,354 --> 00:13:06,983
Actually most of it comes from an
outlet store in...

201
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,160
Don't answer that.

202
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,566
...Romania.

203
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:13,668
Don't! Stop! She's using her nosey
reporter skills,

204
00:13:13,669 --> 00:13:17,517
on your weak willed mind to find
out all our secrets.

205
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:23,718
Such tricks...won't work...
on me.

206
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,343
-Please talk slower
-Temptress.

207
00:13:25,344 --> 00:13:28,576
What secrets? You're so predictable.

208
00:13:28,577 --> 00:13:30,772
Predictable, predictable?

209
00:13:30,773 --> 00:13:34,531
Oh, you call THIS predictable?

210
00:13:34,532 --> 00:13:36,671
Your Alligators, yes.

211
00:13:37,414 --> 00:13:39,324
I was thinking about it on the way over.

212
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:41,835
What's this? BOOM!

213
00:13:41,836 --> 00:13:44,424
-In your face.
-Cliché.

214
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:45,457
No, look, watch.

215
00:13:46,315 --> 00:13:47,319
Juvenile.

216
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,408
-Shuck it all!
-Tacky

217
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,466
-Oh, so sorry.
-Seen it.

218
00:13:51,467 --> 00:13:53,320
-What's this one do?
-Garish.

219
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,382
Okay, the spiders new.

220
00:13:56,778 --> 00:13:57,845
Spider?

221
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,639
Ee, Uh, yes!

222
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:08,584
The "spee..ider". Even the smallest bite
from arachnis deathicus

223
00:14:08,585 --> 00:14:10,985
Will instantly paralyze...OW!

224
00:14:11,151 --> 00:14:12,301
Get it off!

225
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:15,950
Ow!
-Give it up, Megamind. Your plans never work.

226
00:14:17,493 --> 00:14:20,891
Let's stop wasting time and call your
boyfriend in tights, shall we?

227
00:14:22,108 --> 00:14:23,619
OOOWWW!

228
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,217
It is with great pleasure that I present to
Metro Man, this new museum.

229
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:29,502
If you please.

230
00:14:37,471 --> 00:14:39,618
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.

231
00:15:01,861 --> 00:15:06,599
-Megamind.
-Oh, bravo Metro Man.

232
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,068
Booooo!

233
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,051
Yes, I can play along too.

234
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:13,077
Booooo.

235
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,551
Should have known you'd try
to crash the party.

236
00:15:15,552 --> 00:15:17,696
Oh, I intend to do more than crash it.

237
00:15:17,697 --> 00:15:23,506
This is the day you and Montrosity,
shall not soon forget.

238
00:15:23,507 --> 00:15:26,025
It's pronounced Metro City!

239
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:28,783
Oh, potato, tomato,
potato, tomato.

240
00:15:28,784 --> 00:15:30,130
We all know how this ends.

241
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:32,008
With you behind bars.

242
00:15:32,009 --> 00:15:36,124
Oh, I'm shaking in my custom
baby seal-leather boots.

243
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:38,242
You will leave, Montrosity.

244
00:15:38,244 --> 00:15:41,030
Or this will be the last
you ever hear of,

245
00:15:41,031 --> 00:15:42,999
Roxanne Ritchi!

246
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
-Huh?
-Roxanne!

247
00:15:45,001 --> 00:15:48,311
-Don't panic Roxie, I'm on my way.
-I'm not panicking.

248
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:52,329
In order to stop me, You need to
find me first, Metro Man.

249
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,912
We're at the abandoned observatory.

250
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:56,151
-Ah ha.
-NO! No we're not!

251
00:15:56,152 --> 00:15:58,275
Don't listen to her, she's crazy.

252
00:16:19,842 --> 00:16:21,818
Metro Man approaching, sir.

253
00:16:21,819 --> 00:16:23,438
-HAH!
-Hah, hah!

254
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,678
Hah, hah, hah.

255
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:42,601
Hold on a second.

256
00:16:49,913 --> 00:16:51,679
Oh, good heavens.

257
00:16:51,683 --> 00:16:56,164
You didn't think you were in the real
observatory, did you?

258
00:17:01,706 --> 00:17:03,612
Ready the death ray, Minion.

259
00:17:03,613 --> 00:17:05,261
Death ray, readying.

260
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:10,673
Over here, old friend.

261
00:17:10,677 --> 00:17:11,947
In case you haven't noticed,

262
00:17:11,948 --> 00:17:14,294
You've fallen right into my trap.

263
00:17:14,295 --> 00:17:17,201
You can't trap justice.
It's an idea, a belief.

264
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:20,792
Even the most heartfelt belief,
can be corroded over time.

265
00:17:20,798 --> 00:17:22,583
Justice is a noncorrosive metal.

266
00:17:22,586 --> 00:17:25,197
But metals can be melted by the
heat of 're-vange'.

267
00:17:25,203 --> 00:17:27,328
It's 'revenge' and it's best
served cold.

268
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:30,393
But it can be easily reheated, in the
microwave of evil.

269
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:31,788
Well I think your warranty is about
to expire.

270
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,617
Maybe I got an extended warranty?

271
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:36,551
Warranties are invalid if you don't use
the product for its intended purpose.

272
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:39,786
Oh, girls, girls, you're both pretty.
Can I go home now?

273
00:17:39,798 --> 00:17:46,240
Of course, that is if Metro Man, can withstand
the full concentrated power of the...SUN!

274
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,204
FIRE!

275
00:17:58,198 --> 00:17:59,670
Minion, fire...

276
00:17:59,673 --> 00:18:01,867
Uh, it's still warming up, sir.

277
00:18:01,871 --> 00:18:03,313
-Come again?
-Warming up, sir.

278
00:18:03,317 --> 00:18:06,144
Warming up?
The sun is warming up?

279
00:18:06,148 --> 00:18:08,680
One...sssecond...more.

280
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,998
aaannnd....jussst.

281
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:15,161
Tippy, tappy tippy tap, tap,
tip top more.

282
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,892
-Honestly.
-And we are ready, in just.

283
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,108
Oh! I told you to have things ready.

284
00:18:20,109 --> 00:18:22,036
I told you countless times.

285
00:18:22,036 --> 00:18:23,373
Why do you always blame me?

286
00:18:23,374 --> 00:18:25,854
My spider bite is acting.

287
00:18:25,858 --> 00:18:28,321
Your plan is failing,
just admit it.

288
00:18:28,326 --> 00:18:30,030
Yeah, good luck with that one.

289
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:31,893
Whose side are you on?

290
00:18:31,894 --> 00:18:33,164
The losing side.

291
00:18:33,165 --> 00:18:36,048
-Thank you.
-Uh, could someone stamp my
frequent kidnapping card?

292
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:42,837
You of all people, know we
discontinued that promotion.

293
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,329
-Chow, chow all.
-Same time next week?

294
00:18:50,061 --> 00:18:51,671
What did he just say?

295
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:53,238
Crab nuggets?

296
00:18:57,605 --> 00:18:59,868
Good lord, I'm trapped.

297
00:18:59,872 --> 00:19:01,632
What kind of trickery is this?

298
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:06,921
You mad genius.
Your dark gift has finally paid off.

299
00:19:06,929 --> 00:19:08,201
It, it has?

300
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:12,379
This dome is obviously lined with copper.

301
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:15,013
-Yeah, so?
-Sir!

302
00:19:15,014 --> 00:19:17,449
Copper drains my powers.

303
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:19,675
Your weakness is copper?

304
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:21,372
You're kidding, right?

305
00:19:47,163 --> 00:19:50,403
I don't think even he could
survive that.

306
00:19:50,943 --> 00:19:54,647
Well, lets not get our hopes up
just yet.

307
00:19:55,136 --> 00:19:56,996
-Look!
-Metro Man.

308
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:59,545
Metro Man...

309
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:01,339
Metro Man! AHHH!

310
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,695
Oh god! Oh my god, oh!

311
00:20:12,897 --> 00:20:14,457
Ewwww.

312
00:20:17,193 --> 00:20:18,992
You did it, sir.

313
00:20:18,995 --> 00:20:20,211
I did it?

314
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:24,955
He did it.

315
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:26,372
I did it.

316
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,891
He did it.

317
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:29,903
-You did it, sir.
-I did it!

318
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,244
-You did it.
-I did it!

319
00:20:31,391 --> 00:20:34,240
Montrocity is mine!

320
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:39,795
You did it sir, you did it, sir.
Yes you did.

321
00:20:39,797 --> 00:20:43,866
All right people, hit it.

322
00:20:50,114 --> 00:20:51,411
Hit it!

323
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:14,236
<i>*Living easy, living free.*</i>

324
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:18,129
<i>*Season ticket on a one way ride.*</i>

325
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:22,937
<i>*Don't need reason, don’t need rhyme*</i>

326
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:26,566
<i>*-Ain't got nothing I'd rather do.*
Drop 'em.</i>

327
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:35,354
<i>*Going down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too,*</i>

328
00:21:36,326 --> 00:21:39,336
<i>*I'm on the Highway to...*</i>

329
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,792
-Highway..
-La, la, la, la, la...

330
00:21:45,793 --> 00:21:48,796
-Highway..
-Ahh, ahh, ahh....

331
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:54,885
First off, what a turnout.

332
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:57,092
How wild is this, huh?

333
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:02,891
All I did was eliminate the most
powerful man in the universe.

334
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:04,295
Are there any questions?

335
00:22:04,298 --> 00:22:06,926
Come on..yes?
You in the back.

336
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:10,469
I'm sure we'd all like to know what you plan
to do with us.

337
00:22:10,475 --> 00:22:11,950
And the city.

338
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,501
Good, I'm glad you asked that one.

339
00:22:13,505 --> 00:22:19,665
Imagine, the most horrible, terrifying
evil thing you could possibly think of.

340
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:23,745
And multiply it by...SIX!

341
00:22:24,941 --> 00:22:31,089
In the mean time I want you to carry on,
with the dreary normal things you,

342
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,871
Normal people do.

343
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:35,101
Let's just have fun with this, come on.

344
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,695
And I will get back to you.

345
00:22:42,832 --> 00:22:44,653
Now slam the door, really hard.

346
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,689
They can...they can still see you.

347
00:22:47,696 --> 00:22:49,217
Now?
Yeah, you're still there.

348
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:50,867
Oh, let's get going.

349
00:22:54,871 --> 00:22:59,332
<i>There he is, Mr. Evil Overlord.</i>

350
00:22:59,332 --> 00:23:00,403
Ahh, Minion.

351
00:23:00,404 --> 00:23:02,729
Did you think this day would ever come?

352
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:07,725
No way, not at all, sir. Never,
never in a million, I mean...

353
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,612
Yes, I did.

354
00:23:09,615 --> 00:23:11,475
Look at the intricate moon links.

355
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:13,814
I'm looking, I'm looking.

356
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:15,533
And what's this?

357
00:23:15,571 --> 00:23:19,130
Looks like one of the giant monitors, in the lair.

358
00:23:19,131 --> 00:23:21,978
But it seems to only carry one station.

359
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:25,231
Oh, that sir is called a window.

360
00:23:25,241 --> 00:23:28,148
-Window...
-All the kids are looking through them.

361
00:23:28,153 --> 00:23:31,730
Oooo, I've never had a view before.

362
00:23:32,101 --> 00:23:35,363
Montrosity Minion, it's all mine.

363
00:23:35,369 --> 00:23:38,676
If my parents could see me now.

364
00:23:38,678 --> 00:23:42,635
Sir, I'm sure they're smiling down
from evil heaven.

365
00:23:42,857 --> 00:23:46,578
Well now that Mr. Goody-two-shoes is out
of the way.

366
00:23:46,584 --> 00:23:49,663
I  can have, everything I want!

367
00:23:49,674 --> 00:23:52,239
And  there's no one to stop me.

368
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,774
<i>*All aboard! Ha, ha, haaaa...*</i>

369
00:23:55,775 --> 00:24:01,846
<i>*Mental wounds healing,
Driving me insane.*</i>

370
00:24:01,847 --> 00:24:06,873
<i>*I'm going off the rails,
on a crazy train.*</i>

371
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:13,864
<i>*I'm going off the rails,
on a crazy train.*</i>

372
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:20,576
<i>*We may as well go home, as I did on my own.*</i>

373
00:24:20,577 --> 00:24:24,599
<i>*Alone again, naturally.*</i>

374
00:24:26,262 --> 00:24:28,535
<i>*To think that only yesterday.*</i>

375
00:24:29,117 --> 00:24:31,263
<i>*I was cheerful bright and gay.*</i>

376
00:24:31,491 --> 00:24:35,711
<i>*Looking forward to, but who wouldn't do,
the role I was about...*</i>

377
00:24:35,713 --> 00:24:42,092
I know, I know.
Always thirsty, never satisfied.

378
00:24:42,102 --> 00:24:45,579
I understand you,
little well dressed bird.

379
00:24:45,588 --> 00:24:53,065
Purposeless, emptiness, it's a vacuum isn't
it. What's your vacuum like?

380
00:24:53,066 --> 00:24:57,365
<i>*Going off the rails, on a crazy train, sir.*</i>

381
00:24:57,366 --> 00:24:59,830
Hey, hey, hey!
Not now, Minion.

382
00:25:01,508 --> 00:25:07,062
I'm in a heated existential discussion
with this dead-eyed plastic desk toy.

383
00:25:10,085 --> 00:25:12,642
I...is something wrong, sir?

384
00:25:13,490 --> 00:25:15,617
Just think about it.

385
00:25:15,618 --> 00:25:17,475
We have it all.

386
00:25:18,886 --> 00:25:20,913
But we have nothing.

387
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:24,404
It's just to easy now.

388
00:25:25,205 --> 00:25:27,409
I'm sorry, you've lost me, sir.

389
00:25:28,143 --> 00:25:33,522
-I mean, we did it, right?
-Well, you did it, sir.

390
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:35,885
Yes you've made that perfectly clear.

391
00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,884
-Then why do I feel so, Mel-on-cholly?
-Huh?

392
00:25:40,892 --> 00:25:43,298
Unhappy.

393
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:50,613
Oh, uh well, uh. What if tomorrow,
we could go kidnap Roxanne Ritchi.

394
00:25:50,625 --> 00:25:52,409
That always seems to lift your spirits.

395
00:25:54,843 --> 00:25:59,031
Good idea, Minion. But without him,
what's the point?

396
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:02,161
-Him, sir?
-Nothing.

397
00:26:03,036 --> 00:26:06,204
Okay, um, all right well just uh, that’s uh,

398
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:07,974
something to consider and um,

399
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:11,132
well, I think I'll just power
down for a while then.

400
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:20,065
He was always there for us.

401
00:26:20,376 --> 00:26:22,225
Dependable.

402
00:26:24,092 --> 00:26:25,547
Perhaps we took him for granted.

403
00:26:25,548 --> 00:26:29,995
Maybe we never really know how good we
have it, until it's gone.

404
00:26:31,639 --> 00:26:33,238
We miss you, Metro Man.

405
00:26:33,241 --> 00:26:35,406
I, miss you.

406
00:26:35,428 --> 00:26:38,876
And I have just one question for,
Megamind.

407
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:40,826
Are you happy now?

408
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,116
This is Roxanne Ritchi reporting from a
city without a hero.

409
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:52,849
Coming up next. Are you ready to be a
slave army? What you need to know.

410
00:26:58,521 --> 00:27:03,310
Aaannd wrap that up and give it
to a child on Christmas.

411
00:27:03,317 --> 00:27:06,420
-'Cause we're done.
-Okay, see you tomorrow, Hal.

412
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:09,782
Wait, Roxie. I'm having a party
at my house.

413
00:27:09,783 --> 00:27:11,951
Coming off the hook, or whatever.
You should come over.

414
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:15,984
I got a DJ rented a bouncy house.
Made a gallon of dip. It's gonna be sick.

415
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:20,338
Oh, I don't know, Hal. I don't really
fell like being around a bunch of people.

416
00:27:20,346 --> 00:27:22,488
No, no, no. That's the best part,
it'll  be like just you and me.

417
00:27:24,404 --> 00:27:28,158
Wow, that uh, that's certainly very tempting.

418
00:27:28,265 --> 00:27:30,078
-But,
-I did hire a wedding photographer.

419
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:32,992
That's just in case, we were like
something crazy happened.

420
00:27:32,998 --> 00:27:35,842
And you'd want a picture of it. Like maybe
we should have this for like ever,

421
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:37,297
like a memory, you know.

422
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:39,269
Um, I'm gonna pass.

423
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:42,395
I have some work here I need
to do. Okay, bye.

424
00:27:42,401 --> 00:27:44,669
So Thursday? Soft, Thursday?

425
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:46,839
-Goodnight, Hal.
-It's a soft yes, on Thursday.

426
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,210
What's, wrong with me?

427
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:54,679
Rented a bouncy house? Chick's don't like
bouncy houses, they like clown's.

428
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,604
OW! Ohhh!

429
00:27:57,318 --> 00:28:00,816
Stupid van!
Broke my finger!

430
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,861
I've made a horrible mistake.

431
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:41,616
I didn't mean to destroy you.

432
00:28:41,617 --> 00:28:44,310
I mean, I meant to destroy you.

433
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:46,681
I didn't think it would really work.

434
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:53,608
What are we suppose to do? Without you,
evil is running rampant through the streets.

435
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:57,213
I am so tired of running rampant
through the streets.

436
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:01,702
What's the point of being bad when
there's no good to try and stop you?

437
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:04,249
Someone has to stop, Megamind.

438
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,530
Hey, we're closing soon.

439
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:06,739
Oh, you scared me.

440
00:29:06,741 --> 00:29:08,543
-Barry, right?
-Bernard.

441
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:12,951
Bernard, I was just well I was
talking to myself.

442
00:29:12,958 --> 00:29:14,705
You may think I'm a little bit nuts.

443
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,940
I'm not allowed to self guess directly.

444
00:29:16,941 --> 00:29:17,781
Thank you, I just...

445
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,533
Bernard, I'll just be another minute.

446
00:29:21,251 --> 00:29:23,118
-Okay.
-Thanks.

447
00:29:23,236 --> 00:29:26,826
I had so many evil plans in the works.

448
00:29:27,186 --> 00:29:28,825
The illiteracy beam.

449
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:31,004
Typhoon cheese.

450
00:29:31,007 --> 00:29:32,654
Robo sheep.

451
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,695
Battles we will now, never have.

452
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:41,215
You know we never had the chance
to say goodbye.

453
00:29:41,632 --> 00:29:44,577
So, it's good that we have this time now.

454
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,235
You know, before I destroy the place.

455
00:29:47,241 --> 00:29:50,647
Nothing personal, it just brings back
to many painful memories.

456
00:29:54,832 --> 00:29:56,704
Hello, hello?

457
00:29:56,708 --> 00:29:57,739
Roxanne!

458
00:30:06,944 --> 00:30:09,504
That's a pretty tasteless costume.

459
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:14,227
-Costume?
-Megamind's head is not that grossly exaggerated.

460
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:19,017
Oh you even made a cheap replica of
his dehydration gun. How...

461
00:30:20,227 --> 00:30:21,948
Hello, is someone there?

462
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:27,008
Hello, who's there?

463
00:30:27,609 --> 00:30:30,079
Whoa! Hey, hey. Whew.

464
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,199
It's just you, Bernard.

465
00:30:31,202 --> 00:30:33,952
Oh, yes it's just me.
Bernard.

466
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,600
Well thank you for letting me stay.

467
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,551
Look I wouldn't stay for more than two minutes
and thirty seven seconds if I were you.

468
00:30:39,555 --> 00:30:42,302
We're having the walls and ceiling removed.

469
00:30:42,302 --> 00:30:44,604
Wow, that sounds like. Quite the renovation.

470
00:30:44,605 --> 00:30:47,593
I guess I'll. Guess I'll ride down
with you then.

471
00:30:54,232 --> 00:30:57,511
I kept thinking he was going to do
one of his last minute escapes.

472
00:30:58,426 --> 00:31:01,364
Yeah, he was really good at those.

473
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:04,127
Oh, if only the world had a reset button.

474
00:31:04,642 --> 00:31:06,988
I've looked into the reset button.

475
00:31:08,038 --> 00:31:09,907
The size is impossible.

476
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:15,657
Oh, Bernard, I didn't know you had...feelings.
Are you okay?

477
00:31:16,822 --> 00:31:21,561
Metro Man is gone. And now there's
no one left to challenge Megamind.

478
00:31:21,568 --> 00:31:23,280
Oh, come on, Bernard.

479
00:31:23,281 --> 00:31:26,009
As long as there's evil good will
rise up against it.

480
00:31:26,015 --> 00:31:27,922
Ohhh, I wish.

481
00:31:27,923 --> 00:31:30,996
I believe someone is going to stand
up to Megamind.

482
00:31:30,997 --> 00:31:32,034
-You really think so?
-Yeah.

483
00:31:32,035 --> 00:31:35,904
I mean, it's like they say.
Heroes aren't born, they're made.

484
00:31:38,345 --> 00:31:41,777
Heroes can be made. That's it!

485
00:31:42,305 --> 00:31:44,967
-All you need are the right ingredients.
-Yeah.

486
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:46,610
-Bravery.
-Yes.

487
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,910
-Strength.
-Of course.

488
00:31:47,912 --> 00:31:49,718
-Determination.
-Imperative.

489
00:31:49,722 --> 00:31:51,677
And a smidgen of DNA.

490
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:55,095
-With that, anyone can be a hero.
-Yeah!

491
00:31:55,096 --> 00:31:56,761
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

492
00:31:57,092 --> 00:31:58,305
I think we should run.

493
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:00,040
Bye.

494
00:32:01,226 --> 00:32:03,384
Time to put the past behind us.

495
00:32:04,783 --> 00:32:06,763
Only the future...AHH!

496
00:32:06,766 --> 00:32:10,082
Oh, I'm to close.
I'm genuinely scared right now.

497
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:12,517
Oh, I hope no ones seeing this.

498
00:32:12,584 --> 00:32:16,374
Create a hero? Wait, wait, what?
Why would you do that?

499
00:32:16,381 --> 00:32:18,087
So I have someone to fight.

500
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:20,831
Minion, I'm a villain without a hero.

501
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,862
A ying, with no yang.

502
00:32:22,865 --> 00:32:25,276
A bull fighter with no bull to fight.

503
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:27,924
In other words, I have no purpose.

504
00:32:27,928 --> 00:32:30,625
Now, ask me how I'm going to do it.

505
00:32:30,626 --> 00:32:31,774
Go on, ask.

506
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:33,277
How are you doing to do it?

507
00:32:35,228 --> 00:32:37,773
I'm going to give someone, I don't know
who yet.

508
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:43,398
Metro Man's powers. I'm going to train that
someone to become Montrocity's new hero.

509
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:45,126
Over here, follow.

510
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:50,353
And then, finally I'm going to fight that hero.
In an epic battle of good and evil.

511
00:32:50,361 --> 00:32:53,283
We could put everything back the way it was.

512
00:32:53,288 --> 00:32:55,733
When the world was perfect.

513
00:32:55,755 --> 00:32:58,168
And rosy. Behold, Minion.

514
00:32:58,186 --> 00:33:00,289
Metro Man's cape.

515
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,302
Look closely.

516
00:33:01,311 --> 00:33:02,949
Tell me what you see?

517
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:03,964
Dandruff?

518
00:33:04,137 --> 00:33:06,699
Yes, it's his DNA.

519
00:33:06,708 --> 00:33:11,646
From this, we'll extract the source of
Metro Man's awesome power.

520
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:16,624
Sir, I think this is a bad idea.

521
00:33:16,629 --> 00:33:21,791
Yes, It's a very wickedly bad idea.
For the greater good of man.

522
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,463
But I'm saying this is a kind of
bad, bad.

523
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:27,395
Okay, you might think it's good
in your bad perception.

524
00:33:27,396 --> 00:33:30,844
But from a good perception,
it is just plain bad.

525
00:33:30,855 --> 00:33:33,186
Oh, you don't know what's good for bad.

526
00:33:34,126 --> 00:33:36,651
Now we have just one shot at this.

527
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,893
We must find a suitable subject.

528
00:33:38,899 --> 00:33:45,819
Someone who will do harm to mine.
Who puts the welfare of others above their own.

529
00:33:46,311 --> 00:33:49,916
What on earth is that?

530
00:33:49,936 --> 00:33:53,082
Seems to be emanating from there, sir.

531
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:58,478
-O-llo,
-Uh, it's hello.

532
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:00,176
Hello, like that?

533
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,485
-Bernard, it's Roxanne.
-It's Roxanne.

534
00:34:02,490 --> 00:34:04,897
I just want to thank you for
inspiring me the other day.

535
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,235
-Oh, You've inspired me too.
-Great!

536
00:34:07,236 --> 00:34:11,055
It's time we stood up to Megamind
and show him he can't push us around.

537
00:34:11,061 --> 00:34:13,677
Oh, oh really.
She's so cute.

538
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:15,649
-I'm already hot on his trail.
-Uh, huh.

539
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,827
And what gives you that idea?

540
00:34:17,831 --> 00:34:20,254
-Uh, sir.
-I just found his secret hideout.

541
00:34:20,259 --> 00:34:21,770
How did she find my hideout?

542
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:24,998
Uh, how did you find his hideout?

543
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:29,663
This is the only building in Metro City
with a big observatory on the roof.

544
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:35,302
Okay, there's no way she'll find
the secret entrance.

545
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:37,940
Oh! There's a doormat here that
say's 'Secret Entrance'.

546
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:42,012
-Minion!
-I kept forgetting where it was.

547
00:34:42,016 --> 00:34:43,617
She'll discover all our secrets.

548
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:46,811
-Ohh, oh no!
-You dim-witted creation of science.

549
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,802
-What?
-Oh, not you Roxanne.

550
00:34:48,807 --> 00:34:51,138
No, I was just yelling at my mothers, urn.

551
00:34:51,143 --> 00:34:52,909
Don't do anything, I'll be right there.

552
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,913
Roxanne?

553
00:34:54,941 --> 00:34:57,085
Oh no, not again.

554
00:35:03,298 --> 00:35:04,670
Roxanne.

555
00:35:04,673 --> 00:35:07,050
-Whoa!
-Oh, I'm glad you're here.

556
00:35:07,053 --> 00:35:08,762
Wait, how did you get here so fast?

557
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:12,809
Well, I uh. I happened to be speed walking
nearby when you called.

558
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:14,061
-In a suit?
-Uh huh.

559
00:35:14,064 --> 00:35:16,392
It's called, 'Formal Speed walking'.

560
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:17,892
But that's not important.

561
00:35:17,894 --> 00:35:19,015
I better take the lead.

562
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,157
This way looks exciting.

563
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:20,930
No, it says, exit.

564
00:35:20,931 --> 00:35:24,202
Uh, which is the abbreviation
for 'Exciting', right?

565
00:35:24,203 --> 00:35:26,705
It's the mother load.

566
00:35:26,706 --> 00:35:28,031
-Ahh.
-Wow.

567
00:35:28,032 --> 00:35:29,703
-Wow.
-Just look at this thing.

568
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:32,379
You know, I really could use your help in
deciphering all this.

569
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:35,503
-Really?
-You're an expert in all things Megamind, right?

570
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:39,991
-Yes, right.
-Together we could figure out his plan
for the city and stop it.

571
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:42,048
Are you in?

572
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:44,376
-Oh, what fun!
-That's what I want to hear.

573
00:35:44,452 --> 00:35:46,488
Minion,
Code-Send in the brain bots.

574
00:35:46,489 --> 00:35:48,922
You know the whole point of a code is...

575
00:35:48,923 --> 00:35:50,946
Oh code-just do it, Minion.

576
00:35:54,182 --> 00:35:56,170
Ahh, it's me you fools!

577
00:35:56,171 --> 00:35:57,281
Bernard!

578
00:35:59,004 --> 00:36:00,290
It's daddy.

579
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,708
Megamind!

580
00:36:04,977 --> 00:36:05,842
What have you done with, Bernard?

581
00:36:05,843 --> 00:36:10,104
Oh Bernard? Oh yes, I'm doing
horrible things to that man.

582
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:12,377
I don't want to get into it but,
Lasers, spikes.

583
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,395
Oh, please no, not the lasers and the spikes!

584
00:36:15,396 --> 00:36:16,924
You know the drill.

585
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,745
Oh no, not the drill.

586
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,602
-Let him go.
-Or what?

587
00:36:21,607 --> 00:36:24,293
Or I'm going to find out what this
weird looking gun does.

588
00:36:24,298 --> 00:36:26,890
No don't!
Don't shoot that gun.

589
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:28,510
I'll just go get him.

590
00:36:28,555 --> 00:36:30,461
Unhand me you fiend!

591
00:36:30,566 --> 00:36:33,278
It, its strength's to much.

592
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:35,480
Oh, I work out.

593
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:40,564
Argh, it's really paying off.
You're so fit, and strangely charismatic.

594
00:36:44,145 --> 00:36:45,179
Are you okay?

595
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,021
I've did my best.
But he's to fantastic.

596
00:36:48,616 --> 00:36:50,461
Here, let me carry that heavy gun for you.

597
00:36:50,462 --> 00:36:51,528
I got this covered.

598
00:36:54,699 --> 00:36:56,193
Let go, it's mine!

599
00:36:55,827 --> 00:36:57,277
Bernard, run!

600
00:36:59,994 --> 00:37:00,996
Give it to me.

601
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:02,331
Oh no!

602
00:37:08,042 --> 00:37:09,030
Roxanne.

603
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:11,773
Ow!

604
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:16,590
Who on earth is that?

605
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,783
Roxanne!

606
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:32,006
Bernard, you were right about that door
being exciting.

607
00:37:32,546 --> 00:37:33,550
This way.

608
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,413
-Aha!
-What are you doing?

609
00:37:40,414 --> 00:37:42,250
This will stop them, here!

610
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:44,244
Seems a bit extreme, doesn't it.

611
00:37:45,957 --> 00:37:47,152
Just throw it.

612
00:37:47,153 --> 00:37:48,936
Daddy's, sorry.

613
00:37:59,719 --> 00:38:02,643
-Wow, that was real exciting.
-Yeah.

614
00:38:02,644 --> 00:38:04,350
-You were very strong in there.
-I know.

615
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:07,284
I've never seen anyone but Metro Man
stand up to him like that.

616
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,444
What's going on?

617
00:38:08,624 --> 00:38:09,710
Hal, what happened?

618
00:38:09,711 --> 00:38:11,121
I think a bee flew up my nose.

619
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:14,323
I was just about to make my frontal
assault to rescue you,

620
00:38:14,324 --> 00:38:16,311
but like fifty ninjas started to attack me.

621
00:38:16,312 --> 00:38:19,270
So I had to beat them all up, and I did...

622
00:38:19,271 --> 00:38:20,579
-and they were all like crying, and stuff.
-Wow.

623
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,272
Brave one, isn't he.

624
00:38:22,276 --> 00:38:23,425
Who are you?

625
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,124
Oh thi..., this is Bernard.

626
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,734
-He's my partner.
-Partner?

627
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:28,599
Yes, yes partner.

628
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,064
Well look partner, I'm her partner.

629
00:38:31,065 --> 00:38:34,371
She doesn't know what she's saying. She's
been through a traumatic experience.

630
00:38:34,372 --> 00:38:36,504
I'd better take him home.
Thanks again, Bernard.

631
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:45,962
I'll call you tomorrow, partner.

632
00:38:46,642 --> 00:38:47,944
Yeah, okay.

633
00:38:48,186 --> 00:38:48,959
I'd like that.

634
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,256
That was weird for everybody. 'Cause you
accidentally, hugged him instead of me.

635
00:38:52,776 --> 00:38:53,556
Sir!

636
00:38:53,897 --> 00:38:54,897
SIR!

637
00:38:54,987 --> 00:38:57,395
Code-Did you find out
who it was?

638
00:38:57,398 --> 00:38:59,642
Huh?
Oh, oh.

639
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,172
Code-get the car.

640
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,663
Code-right away, sir.

641
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,864
-Bye.
-See you tomorrow, Hal.

642
00:39:13,865 --> 00:39:16,267
I'll leave the door unlocked in case
you want to check on me later.

643
00:39:18,154 --> 00:39:22,590
Who is this man,
we've infused with godlike power?

644
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:26,034
Ow, ow, whoa ho.

645
00:39:26,035 --> 00:39:28,957
Well sir, his name's Hal Stewart.
He's twenty eight years old.

646
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:30,627
No criminal record.

647
00:39:30,628 --> 00:39:31,963
Actually, no records at all.

648
00:39:31,964 --> 00:39:34,312
Apparently, this man hasn't accomplished anything.

649
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:36,862
Not yet, Minion.
Not...

650
00:39:37,713 --> 00:39:38,729
...Yet.

651
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:41,506
Could this day get anymore, funtastic?

652
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,633
So I will just go ahead and defuse him,

653
00:39:43,637 --> 00:39:47,053
since this is clearly a mistake.

654
00:39:47,059 --> 00:39:49,773
No, Minion. Something much
more powerful at work.

655
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,821
This is no mistake.

656
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:53,545
It's destiny.

657
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,984
Hal Stewart, prepare for your destiny.

658
00:39:58,985 --> 00:40:02,678
Hal? Hal Stewart?

659
00:40:02,682 --> 00:40:03,694
Am I saying it right?

660
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:05,006
-Stewart.
-Aaah.

661
00:40:06,016 --> 00:40:09,574
Is this a robbery? 'Cause the lady across
the hall has way better stuff than me.

662
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,716
Oh, look. It's Hal Stewart.

663
00:40:11,718 --> 00:40:12,780
Quick, the spray.

664
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:17,069
-Oops, all out.
-Well use the forget-me-stick.

665
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,085
Oh, right!

666
00:40:20,761 --> 00:40:21,764
Just look at him.

667
00:40:23,174 --> 00:40:26,830
Well, he doesn't look quite the
hero type to me.

668
00:40:26,831 --> 00:40:28,212
Oh, you're such a pill, Minion.

669
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,877
The power couldn't ask for a finer claim.

670
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,402
I smell hero.

671
00:40:34,403 --> 00:40:36,758
I smell something burning.

672
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,727
I think it's working!

673
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:40,862
Places, places,
places, places...

674
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:42,867
You have your disguise?

675
00:40:49,327 --> 00:40:50,527
What?

676
00:40:50,528 --> 00:40:52,546
Ah, you look fantastic.

677
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:05,033
Rise, my glorious creation.

678
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:07,754
Rise, and come to Papa.

679
00:41:08,337 --> 00:41:09,323
What's going on?

680
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:12,125
-Easy my child.
-Who are you?

681
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:15,494
I sent  you to this planet to
teach  you about justice.

682
00:41:15,495 --> 00:41:17,859
Honor, and nobility.

683
00:41:18,563 --> 00:41:20,171
I am your father.

684
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:23,215
So you're like, my space Dad?

685
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,570
Yeah, I'm like your space Dad.

686
00:41:27,186 --> 00:41:29,309
And you are, what?

687
00:41:29,313 --> 00:41:32,492
I'm your space, Step-Mom.

688
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:35,382
I, I had some work done recently.

689
00:41:35,389 --> 00:41:37,337
Is this some kind of dream?

690
00:41:37,342 --> 00:41:39,516
This is a dream come true.

691
00:41:39,517 --> 00:41:42,909
You've been blethed
with unfathomamble power.

692
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:43,985
What kind of power?

693
00:41:43,987 --> 00:41:45,154
Unfathamomble.

694
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,731
It's un, without Fathom.

695
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,267
-Whoa
-Yeah, we've come to guide you.

696
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:54,764
On your path to be Montrosity's new hero.

697
00:41:54,779 --> 00:41:58,952
And battle the super genius, of Megamind.

698
00:42:02,197 --> 00:42:04,318
I know this is a lot to take in.

699
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,858
It may take months for you
to come to grips..

700
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,096
No frickin' way.

701
00:42:08,622 --> 00:42:09,828
I wasn't finished.

702
00:42:12,335 --> 00:42:15,522
Wahoo! I'm going to be a hero.

703
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:18,578
I'm going to be a hero.

704
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:23,000
Thee Minion, he's perfect.

705
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:25,420
Aaannd, action!

706
00:42:25,422 --> 00:42:27,833
Someone help me.
-I'm okay.

707
00:42:27,834 --> 00:42:30,812
<i>*Sun is shinning in the sky*</i>

708
00:42:30,812 --> 00:42:32,477
Ohhh, oh!

709
00:42:32,478 --> 00:42:34,337
<i>*There ain't a cloud in sight*</i>

710
00:42:35,215 --> 00:42:36,979
Zap, zap, zap.

711
00:42:37,794 --> 00:42:39,493
Ha, haaa!

712
00:42:40,186 --> 00:42:44,905
The flames of my evil burn bright.
Now you thay thomething cool back at me.

713
00:42:44,906 --> 00:42:47,673
Look, it doesn't even hurt.
Don't even feel it.

714
00:42:47,674 --> 00:42:51,345
No, no, no. Slow it down, and stop.

715
00:42:51,347 --> 00:42:52,886
I said slow down.

716
00:42:53,038 --> 00:42:54,264
Watch out.

717
00:42:58,270 --> 00:43:00,840
He's hopeless. HOPELESS!

718
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:03,548
-Maybe we should change tactics?
-You think so?

719
00:43:03,612 --> 00:43:06,925
Oh, you know how boys are.
They love video games.

720
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,099
I can throw a few parts together.

721
00:43:09,104 --> 00:43:12,711
Can't...wait.
LoL,  smiley face.

722
00:43:12,717 --> 00:43:14,220
Can't wait for what, sir?

723
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:17,351
Oh, that was such a funny story.

724
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:20,168
And brilliantly told, by the way.

725
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:22,192
Okay, now you tell one.

726
00:43:22,197 --> 00:43:24,503
Bernard, I never knew you were so funny.

727
00:43:24,511 --> 00:43:27,201
And, I never heard you laugh before.

728
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:28,738
Yeah, it's been a while.

729
00:43:29,442 --> 00:43:30,658
Feels pretty good.

730
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:34,575
<i>*Mr. Blue, you did it right.*</i>

731
00:43:35,591 --> 00:43:37,201
And, exit.

732
00:43:40,419 --> 00:43:42,425
<i>*Now his hand is on your shoulder*</i>

733
00:43:42,434 --> 00:43:43,758
<i>*Never mind*</i>

734
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:45,858
<i>*I'll remember you this, *</i>

735
00:43:46,439 --> 00:43:49,237
<i>*I'll remember you this way.*</i>

736
00:43:49,238 --> 00:43:50,501
You  don't get out much, do you?

737
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,279
Fun!

738
00:43:53,573 --> 00:43:55,854
I used to come here with my mother
when I was a kid.

739
00:43:56,578 --> 00:43:58,556
It was one of my favorite things to do.

740
00:43:59,395 --> 00:44:00,651
Now look at it.

741
00:44:00,652 --> 00:44:01,807
It's a dump.

742
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:05,048
<i>*Hey Mr. Blue,
we're so please to be with you.*</i>

743
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:08,507
Why are we cleaning up the City, sir?

744
00:44:08,508 --> 00:44:13,577
Um, well we don't want to battle our
new hero in a dump, now...do we?

745
00:44:17,565 --> 00:44:19,104
They're all back.

746
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,707
But how, why?

747
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,150
Maybe Megamind isn't so bad after all.

748
00:44:28,675 --> 00:44:32,828
That's it. Be free, my beautiful dove.

749
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:35,074
Wa haoooo

750
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:42,603
Okay, okay, Metro Man and I,
were never a couple.

751
00:44:42,605 --> 00:44:43,986
But I thought you two were...

752
00:44:43,988 --> 00:44:47,385
I know, everybody did. It's just,
well he was never really my type.

753
00:44:47,392 --> 00:44:48,638
Really?

754
00:44:48,755 --> 00:44:51,228
Okay, now you tell me something.

755
00:44:51,232 --> 00:44:54,094
Something you've never told anyone.

756
00:44:54,847 --> 00:44:58,729
Well, in shh-school.

757
00:44:59,581 --> 00:45:02,304
None of the other kids really liked me.

758
00:45:03,544 --> 00:45:05,823
I was always last one picked
for everything.

759
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,036
Hmm, it's to bad that we didn't
go to the same school.

760
00:45:15,258 --> 00:45:18,466
Hal, I think  you're ready for this.

761
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,408
Do I have a son?

762
00:45:22,409 --> 00:45:25,154
No, Hal, you make me laugh.

763
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,316
It stretches, it's for you.

764
00:45:28,683 --> 00:45:30,501
Hey, what's the 'T' stand for?

765
00:45:30,504 --> 00:45:31,667
Titan.

766
00:45:31,672 --> 00:45:34,210
Tighten? What's that suppose to mean?

767
00:45:34,222 --> 00:45:36,718
It was the only name I
could trademark.

768
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,858
Oh.

769
00:45:38,859 --> 00:45:41,790
Do you have someone special
in your life, Hal?

770
00:45:41,845 --> 00:45:44,072
No not yet, but.

771
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:48,676
There's this really, really good looking one
I've got my eye on, currently.

772
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:57,143
That's very good. Romance is
very inspiring.

773
00:45:57,169 --> 00:46:01,315
-That's what I hear.
-All you have to do, is save her.

774
00:46:01,323 --> 00:46:03,149
And she'll be yours.

775
00:46:03,152 --> 00:46:04,972
-Who want's Churro's?
-I do!

776
00:46:06,782 --> 00:46:08,659
Thanks spaced out, momma.

777
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:11,086
On the count of three,
unsheathe your Churro.

778
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,046
One, two, three!
To Titan.

779
00:46:14,061 --> 00:46:16,967
Tomorrow, you will fight Megamind.

780
00:46:16,968 --> 00:46:19,559
And the city will know your name.

781
00:46:21,558 --> 00:46:24,162
The City's parks' restored to their
original glory.

782
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:26,420
The street's, the safest they've been.

783
00:46:26,422 --> 00:46:27,830
The banks reopened.

784
00:46:27,834 --> 00:46:30,088
Has something happened to Megamind?

785
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:32,811
Has someone tamed this monster?

786
00:46:32,813 --> 00:46:38,376
This is Roxanne Ritchi cautiously optimistic,
and pleasantly confused.

787
00:46:38,422 --> 00:46:41,073
Well you seem in a very good
mood tonight, sir.

788
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:44,420
Huh? Oh yes, how long is this going to take?

789
00:46:44,573 --> 00:46:49,141
Just a few alterations, sir. And I will be
done with your most terrifying cape yet.

790
00:46:49,254 --> 00:46:54,061
I'm calling it, The Black
Mambaaaaaaa...aaaa...aaa.

791
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:59,864
Black Mamba, perfect. Ooo, gosh I am
running late. I have to go.

792
00:46:59,865 --> 00:47:01,719
What, where, where are  you going, sir?

793
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,468
We have our debut battle with Titan tomorrow morning.

794
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:06,793
We haven't even tested your
big battle suit yet.

795
00:47:06,794 --> 00:47:08,262
You attend to the details, Minion.

796
00:47:08,263 --> 00:47:10,573
I have to, run a quick errand.

797
00:47:10,574 --> 00:47:12,290
You don't run errands.

798
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:13,752
What's going on here?

799
00:47:13,753 --> 00:47:15,938
-What?
-Oh, wait a minute.

800
00:47:16,784 --> 00:47:20,803
Are you wearing Jean-Paul Gaultier's,
For Him?

801
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,052
It's just my natural musk.

802
00:47:22,053 --> 00:47:24,006
Now, where are the car keys?

803
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:25,100
Ahhh.

804
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:28,591
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is about Ms. Ritchi, isn't it.

805
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:30,356
Your going on a date with her.

806
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:35,066
No my main man, get out of town.

807
00:47:35,075 --> 00:47:38,550
Oh this is bad, this is bad.
You've fallen in love with her.

808
00:47:38,556 --> 00:47:40,960
You are forgetting your place, Minion.

809
00:47:40,964 --> 00:47:42,595
Now give me the keys.

810
00:47:43,695 --> 00:47:47,406
What happens when Roxanne finds
out who you really are?

811
00:47:47,413 --> 00:47:49,187
She will never find out.

812
00:47:49,191 --> 00:47:51,246
That's the point of lying.

813
00:47:51,247 --> 00:47:53,172
Ahhh!

814
00:47:53,173 --> 00:47:57,135
Honestly, If I didn't know any better I'd think
this was your first day of being evil.

815
00:47:57,142 --> 00:47:58,393
NO!

816
00:47:59,361 --> 00:48:01,480
This has gone far enough.

817
00:48:02,564 --> 00:48:05,008
Oh, that was really grown up.

818
00:48:07,195 --> 00:48:09,351
Sir please, it's for your own good.

819
00:48:09,533 --> 00:48:10,887
Well what do you know.

820
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:13,073
I may not know much, but I do know this.

821
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:16,238
The bad guy doesn't get the girl.

822
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:19,008
Maybe I don't want to be the bad
guy anymore.

823
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:24,070
You heard me.

824
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:25,903
Who are you?

825
00:48:26,496 --> 00:48:29,483
-Now give me the keys.
-NO!

826
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:32,776
My soul purpose in life is
to look after you.

827
00:48:32,782 --> 00:48:34,796
Well I don't need you to look after me.

828
00:48:34,799 --> 00:48:37,031
What are you...what are you saying?

829
00:48:37,034 --> 00:48:39,852
-You don't need me?
-Let me make it clear.

830
00:48:39,858 --> 00:48:42,186
Code-I don't need you.

831
00:48:42,191 --> 00:48:43,998
You know what, you know what.

832
00:48:46,725 --> 00:48:49,548
Code-I'll just pack my thing and go.

833
00:48:49,549 --> 00:48:50,710
Code-Fine!

834
00:48:50,711 --> 00:48:52,333
Code-Fine back.

835
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,538
Well good luck on your date.

836
00:48:57,539 --> 00:49:00,386
-I will.
-That doesn't even make any sense.

837
00:49:00,387 --> 00:49:01,336
I know.

838
00:49:32,455 --> 00:49:35,844
I know I am so close, I can feel it.

839
00:49:38,272 --> 00:49:42,113
Okay, okay I just have to take
a step back.

840
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:49,362
Wait a minute.

841
00:50:01,658 --> 00:50:03,592
Titan.

842
00:50:03,593 --> 00:50:05,494
What's a Titan?

843
00:50:05,495 --> 00:50:08,708
My super ears are burning.

844
00:50:10,113 --> 00:50:13,238
I usually just hear criminals. You
haven't been naughty, have you?

845
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:16,453
I'm totally messing with you. I'm totally messing
with you.

846
00:50:16,454 --> 00:50:17,576
The names Titan.

847
00:50:18,478 --> 00:50:21,986
-Titan?
-Your very own heroic  guardian
of pure awesome.

848
00:50:21,987 --> 00:50:24,086
What's your name? Just kidding, I know
everything about you.

849
00:50:24,087 --> 00:50:27,244
Oh, oh! And I brought some flowers,

850
00:50:27,246 --> 00:50:30,719
Didn't know what you liked, so I
just grabbed  you know, all of them.

851
00:50:32,554 --> 00:50:35,486
Okay, you don't like flowers.
Okay, uh, uh, forget the flowers.

852
00:50:35,487 --> 00:50:38,781
-What do you want?
-Thought maybe we could go for a little
flight around town.

853
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:40,511
-Get to know each other first.
-WHOA!

854
00:50:41,558 --> 00:50:43,402
It's suppose to be very thrilling for you.

855
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:44,598
Just what do you think you're doing?

856
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:45,767
Oh are I moving to fast?

857
00:50:45,768 --> 00:50:49,953
You're probably right. I should just
rescue you a few times before we get
all romantic.

858
00:50:49,954 --> 00:50:51,263
Whoops!

859
00:50:51,629 --> 00:50:55,315
Saved you. You are lucky to
have such a great hero here.

860
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:57,861
Oh no. Somebody do something?

861
00:50:57,862 --> 00:51:00,338
Oh, right, right. Duh! I gotcha.

862
00:51:06,374 --> 00:51:09,762
That was fun, you almost died.
But I saved you.

863
00:51:09,763 --> 00:51:11,315
-Aaaah, building!
-AH!

864
00:51:15,701 --> 00:51:16,803
Gotcha!

865
00:51:16,804 --> 00:51:19,420
Whoo, I'm sorry.
What were you saying?

866
00:51:19,421 --> 00:51:21,775
I couldn't hear you over
the sound of me saving your life.

867
00:51:21,777 --> 00:51:23,403
Put me down, right now!

868
00:51:23,404 --> 00:51:25,942
Okay, all right, all right,
hold on.

869
00:51:28,568 --> 00:51:29,898
Are you crazy?

870
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:33,584
I suppose I'm, a little crazy...
about you.

871
00:51:33,585 --> 00:51:35,254
Who are you? Really.

872
00:51:35,267 --> 00:51:40,262
Oooh, oooh, right. Well prepare
to have your mind blown, little lady.

873
00:51:41,428 --> 00:51:43,622
-Tada!
-Hal?

874
00:51:43,623 --> 00:51:45,991
Yeah, isn't this great?

875
00:51:45,992 --> 00:51:48,162
Now there's nothing keeping us apart.

876
00:51:48,164 --> 00:51:50,077
No, it's not great.

877
00:51:50,078 --> 00:51:54,451
Wow, our first fight. This is so us,
we're like an old married couple.

878
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:57,604
There is no us, okay. There will
never be an us.

879
00:51:57,605 --> 00:52:00,078
But, I have powers.

880
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:02,869
I have a cape, I'm the good guy.

881
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:03,640
You are a good guy, Hal.

882
00:52:03,641 --> 00:52:06,933
But you don't understand we need to
find out why...

883
00:52:06,934 --> 00:52:08,917
-Right now,
-This isn't right.

884
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:11,200
-Listen to me, Hal.
-You're suppose to be with me.

885
00:52:11,201 --> 00:52:13,337
I'm trying to warn you, Hal.

886
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:17,178
It's Tighten. It's TIGHTEN, not Hal.

887
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:42,165
-Bernard.
-Roxanne.

888
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:45,842
-Sorry I'm late.
-Wow, your hair looks exciting.

889
00:52:45,848 --> 00:52:48,995
Hmm, not the only exciting development
of the night.

890
00:52:49,010 --> 00:52:51,456
Megamind's created a new hero.

891
00:52:51,457 --> 00:52:52,790
And I know why.

892
00:52:53,841 --> 00:52:55,387
It all makes sense now.

893
00:52:55,391 --> 00:52:59,947
He missed getting his butt kicked, so he created
a new hero to kick it for him.

894
00:53:00,298 --> 00:53:02,705
But why did he pick, Hal?

895
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:05,839
Hal is the worst possible person
you could pick.

896
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:08,198
Wow, that's a lot to take in.

897
00:53:08,203 --> 00:53:10,030
It, it boggles my mind.

898
00:53:10,034 --> 00:53:12,036
I am extremely boggled.

899
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,394
You know, I'm sure we'll get to the bottom
of who's kicking who's butt.

900
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:16,402
But in the mean time.

901
00:53:17,316 --> 00:53:19,722
Let's enjoy each other's company.

902
00:53:19,727 --> 00:53:22,965
I'm sorry, Bernard. Of course, your right,

903
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,904
you know, I could use a breather.

904
00:53:25,914 --> 00:53:31,704
To, Bernard. For being the only normal
thing in my crazy upside down world.

905
00:53:31,714 --> 00:53:35,011
To...being normal.

906
00:53:45,312 --> 00:53:47,403
-Roxanne.
-Yes?

907
00:53:48,564 --> 00:53:50,604
Say I wasn't so normal.

908
00:53:51,283 --> 00:53:57,390
Say I was bald and had the complexion
of a popular primary color.

909
00:53:57,418 --> 00:54:00,426
As a random, non specific example.

910
00:54:01,195 --> 00:54:03,054
Would you still enjoy my company?

911
00:54:03,055 --> 00:54:05,890
Of course, you don't judge a book by
its cover.

912
00:54:05,895 --> 00:54:07,519
Or a person from the outside.

913
00:54:07,522 --> 00:54:09,426
Oh, that's a relief to hear.

914
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:11,204
You judge them based on their actions.

915
00:54:11,913 --> 00:54:14,483
Well that seems kinda petty,
don't you think.

916
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:45,883
-You.
-What, what?

917
00:54:46,447 --> 00:54:48,774
Oh, don't look at me!

918
00:54:48,778 --> 00:54:50,595
Just, just a technical glitch.

919
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:51,966
Don't look yet.

920
00:54:52,295 --> 00:54:54,144
My bad.

921
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,916
Where were we?

922
00:55:01,501 --> 00:55:03,248
Now, now, hold on.

923
00:55:03,252 --> 00:55:03,843
YOU!

924
00:55:24,041 --> 00:55:26,675
I can explain.

925
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:30,446
What about everything you just said?

926
00:55:30,449 --> 00:55:32,750
About judging a book by it's cover.

927
00:55:32,754 --> 00:55:36,098
Well let's take a look at the contents
then, shall we?

928
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:37,533
You destroyed Metro Man.

929
00:55:37,537 --> 00:55:42,887
You took over the city and then you
actually got me to care about you.

930
00:55:44,051 --> 00:55:46,787
Why are you so evil?

931
00:55:46,788 --> 00:55:48,210
Tricking me?

932
00:55:48,212 --> 00:55:51,282
What could you possibly hope to gain?

933
00:55:56,362 --> 00:55:57,382
Wait a minute.

934
00:55:57,383 --> 00:56:00,181
Oh, I don't believe this.

935
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:07,115
Do you really think that I would
ever be with you?

936
00:56:09,444 --> 00:56:10,568
no...

937
00:56:43,214 --> 00:56:46,334
Okay Minion, you were right.

938
00:56:46,344 --> 00:56:49,342
I was....less right.

939
00:56:49,647 --> 00:56:51,934
We should stick to what we're good at.

940
00:56:51,938 --> 00:56:53,827
Being bad.

941
00:56:55,125 --> 00:56:56,137
Minion...

942
00:57:15,571 --> 00:57:16,574
You there.

943
00:57:17,662 --> 00:57:18,666
Yeah, you.

944
00:57:19,786 --> 00:57:22,845
Bring out, the 'Black Mamba'!

945
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:59,323
Okay, Titan it's time to go down,
in style.

946
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,161
I hear there's a new hero.

947
00:58:24,162 --> 00:58:26,597
who dares to challenge my evil.

948
00:58:26,621 --> 00:58:29,847
Where is the one they call, Titan?

949
00:58:33,721 --> 00:58:36,098
Challenge me, if you dare.

950
00:58:58,918 --> 00:59:00,366
Oh no, we're gonna crash.

951
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:06,435
This is embarrassing.

952
00:59:12,939 --> 00:59:15,123
Ballsy and incipient.

953
00:59:15,126 --> 00:59:18,920
Boneheaded, irresponsible.

954
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:20,194
RUDE!

955
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:22,775
Unprofessional, that's what this is.

956
00:59:22,783 --> 00:59:26,290
Would Metro Man have kept me waiting?

957
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:28,369
Of course not, he was a pro.

958
00:59:28,374 --> 00:59:31,213
Hey, Megamind. You're actually
the guy I want to see.

959
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:32,900
Also, there's a door here.

960
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:37,144
Do you have any idea how long
I waited for you?

961
00:59:37,151 --> 00:59:38,675
No, no, no, I totally understand what you're saying.

962
00:59:38,678 --> 00:59:41,380
Could you just shut up for one second, I'm trying
to beat this level.

963
00:59:41,385 --> 00:59:43,594
Were you even planning on showing up?

964
00:59:43,598 --> 00:59:45,235
What's this?

965
00:59:47,452 --> 00:59:49,780
Where did you get all this stuff?

966
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:51,612
It doesn't belong to me.

967
00:59:51,715 --> 00:59:53,097
You stole it!

968
00:59:53,099 --> 00:59:55,579
-Pretty cool, right.
-Oh no, no, no. You're a hero.

969
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,181
Being a hero is for losers.

970
00:59:57,182 --> 00:59:59,971
It's work, work, work twenty four seven,
and for what?

971
00:59:59,976 --> 01:00:05,313
I only took the gig to get the girl. And it turns
out Roxanne doesn't want anything to do with me.

972
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:06,979
Roxanne Ritchi?

973
01:00:06,982 --> 01:00:08,184
Yeah, Roxanne Ritchi.

974
01:00:08,187 --> 01:00:12,666
I saw her having dinner, and making googly eyes
at some intellectual dweeb.

975
01:00:12,673 --> 01:00:14,958
-Ohhhh
-Who needs all that noise.

976
01:00:14,962 --> 01:00:18,424
That's why I think, WE should
team up.

977
01:00:18,426 --> 01:00:20,074
You? Wait! What?

978
01:00:20,077 --> 01:00:22,550
With my power, and your big
headedness,

979
01:00:22,551 --> 01:00:24,376
we could rule the city.

980
01:00:24,377 --> 01:00:27,049
-You want to team up?
-I even drew up some new costume designs.

981
01:00:27,053 --> 01:00:28,389
-See
-Costume design?

982
01:00:28,392 --> 01:00:32,070
You be the brain so you get a little brain
wearing glasses on your costume, or something.

983
01:00:32,076 --> 01:00:36,531
And since I'm the cool one, I'll have like
two tanks sword fighting.

984
01:00:36,919 --> 01:00:38,735
I can't believe you.

985
01:00:38,738 --> 01:00:46,124
All your gifts all your powers, and you
squander them for your own personal gain.

986
01:00:46,137 --> 01:00:47,756
-Yes!
-NO!

987
01:00:47,757 --> 01:00:52,829
I 'm the villain, you're the good guy.
I do something bad, and you come and get me.

988
01:00:52,830 --> 01:00:54,757
That's why I created you.

989
01:00:54,761 --> 01:00:57,387
Yeah, right. You're nuts.

990
01:00:57,388 --> 01:01:00,932
-Space Dad told me.
-Look, I'm your Space Dad.

991
01:01:02,391 --> 01:01:04,700
You should be more like Metro Man.

992
01:01:05,906 --> 01:01:06,965
You tricked me?

993
01:01:06,968 --> 01:01:08,857
Oh, don't like that, huh?

994
01:01:08,861 --> 01:01:09,964
Well there's more.

995
01:01:11,497 --> 01:01:15,281
I'm also the intellectual dweeb
dating Roxanne.

996
01:01:15,704 --> 01:01:19,325
-No.
-And we were smooching up a storm.

997
01:01:19,326 --> 01:01:22,305
Mmmore...Mmmore...Mmmore.

998
01:01:22,306 --> 01:01:23,846
When I get my hands on you
I'm gonna,...

999
01:01:23,847 --> 01:01:25,969
YES! Yes I know.

1000
01:01:25,970 --> 01:01:29,796
Bring me to justice. Oh god,
how I missed this.

1001
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,427
And the hero strikes the first blow.

1002
01:01:35,431 --> 01:01:37,650
But evil returns with a backhand.

1003
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,451
YES!

1004
01:01:48,688 --> 01:01:50,638
Ahh...shhhh.

1005
01:01:52,232 --> 01:01:54,403
Come out you little freak!

1006
01:01:54,404 --> 01:01:57,011
I want to see what that big brain
looks like on the pavement.

1007
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:06,606
You fell for the oldest evil trick in the book.

1008
01:02:07,635 --> 01:02:09,101
You little blue, twerp.

1009
01:02:11,674 --> 01:02:13,504
En Garde!

1010
01:02:18,100 --> 01:02:20,280
Oh, now that's the spirit.

1011
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:23,072
Take, that, parry again!

1012
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:26,111
Now it's time for some witty back
and forth banter.

1013
01:02:26,112 --> 01:02:28,626
You go first.

1014
01:02:28,627 --> 01:02:31,182
Look, I'm not sure where to go with that.

1015
01:02:32,639 --> 01:02:34,498
This one's for stealing my girlfriend.

1016
01:02:40,334 --> 01:02:43,040
This one's for space Dad making a fool out of me.

1017
01:02:50,632 --> 01:02:54,014
And Megamind! This one's for
Space, Step-Mom.

1018
01:02:54,015 --> 01:02:55,574
You lied to her!

1019
01:02:55,575 --> 01:02:59,613
Oh, well done, I thought that pummeling
went really, really well.

1020
01:02:59,615 --> 01:03:01,493
I mean, I have a few notes.

1021
01:03:01,494 --> 01:03:02,982
-Notes?
-But they can wait.

1022
01:03:02,993 --> 01:03:04,446
You can take me to jail now.

1023
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,409
Oh, no, no, no. I was thinking
more like the morgue.

1024
01:03:07,410 --> 01:03:08,924
-You're dead!
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1025
01:03:08,925 --> 01:03:10,689
This isn't how you play the game.

1026
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,513
Game over.

1027
01:03:18,813 --> 01:03:19,851
Brain Bots.

1028
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,145
I'm calling time out.

1029
01:03:28,058 --> 01:03:29,670
Time out, time out!

1030
01:03:40,659 --> 01:03:43,495
Brain bots. Initiate the fail safe.

1031
01:03:50,548 --> 01:03:52,861
Guess what, Buster Brown?

1032
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:56,493
It's made from Copper. You're powerless
against it.

1033
01:03:56,494 --> 01:03:59,082
It's a very safe metal used to defeat...

1034
01:03:59,083 --> 01:04:00,936
Metro Man?

1035
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:04,982
You, should stop comparing me
to Metro Man.

1036
01:04:14,137 --> 01:04:16,932
You can run Megamind,
but you can't hide.

1037
01:04:16,934 --> 01:04:18,840
We're saved, we're saved!

1038
01:04:18,841 --> 01:04:20,919
What's your name, new hero?

1039
01:04:20,920 --> 01:04:23,522
-It's Tighten.
-Thank you, thank you.

1040
01:04:23,523 --> 01:04:25,653
Tighten has freed us.

1041
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:27,581
Oh I wouldn't say free.

1042
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:30,839
More like, under new management.

1043
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:37,055
What do you want?

1044
01:04:37,056 --> 01:04:41,294
-Titan's turned evil.
-Congratulations, another one of your genius
plans has backfired on you.

1045
01:04:41,602 --> 01:04:43,836
And why did my doorman let you up?

1046
01:04:44,344 --> 01:04:48,365
-Carlos?
-What are you, no, no!

1047
01:04:48,366 --> 01:04:49,467
I need your help.

1048
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:51,891
Why do you need MY help?

1049
01:04:51,892 --> 01:04:55,905
Because you're the
smartest person I know.

1050
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,053
Well you can't hide here.

1051
01:04:59,054 --> 01:05:01,096
Copper should  have worked,
why didn't the copper work?

1052
01:05:01,097 --> 01:05:03,140
The copper worked perfectly well the last time.

1053
01:05:03,141 --> 01:05:04,930
Copper? You're not making any sense.

1054
01:05:04,931 --> 01:05:08,687
Look, if we don't find Titan's weakness.
He'll destroy the whole city.

1055
01:05:11,124 --> 01:05:12,949
Okay, how can I help?

1056
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,853
We need to find answers.
You knew Metro Man best.

1057
01:05:15,859 --> 01:05:20,315
Did he have a hideout, a cave, a solitary
fortress of some kind?

1058
01:05:20,322 --> 01:05:22,089
Anything that would give us clues.

1059
01:05:22,507 --> 01:05:25,483
Well, there is one place I know.

1060
01:05:27,267 --> 01:05:30,578
You gave him these powers, can't
you just take them away?

1061
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:35,269
I can't, I lost my diffuser gun when I
misplaced the invisible car.

1062
01:05:35,276 --> 01:05:37,059
The night you dumped me.

1063
01:05:37,286 --> 01:05:39,422
Alone.

1064
01:05:39,184 --> 01:05:41,099
In the rain.

1065
01:05:41,793 --> 01:05:43,700
-Did you ever look back?
-NO!

1066
01:05:43,701 --> 01:05:47,608
-Oh, my giant blue head.
-I guess we're here.

1067
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,840
So, this is where he hid it.

1068
01:05:53,846 --> 01:05:58,342
After all these years. My old shhool house.

1069
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:03,784
You know, I think there's an
apology in order, for the other night.

1070
01:06:03,788 --> 01:06:05,795
Okay that would be nice.
But make it quick.

1071
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,960
We have much more pressing
matters to deal with.

1072
01:06:11,361 --> 01:06:16,445
Wow, can't believe he kept
all this stuff.

1073
01:06:16,852 --> 01:06:19,647
Aww, I remember when he
wore that.

1074
01:06:19,652 --> 01:06:21,014
Can we try to stay focused here?

1075
01:06:21,015 --> 01:06:23,144
Yes of course, you're right, focused.

1076
01:06:24,338 --> 01:06:26,507
HEY! Come over and look at this.

1077
01:06:26,509 --> 01:06:28,598
What is it?
What did you find?

1078
01:06:30,182 --> 01:06:32,888
Um.....look!

1079
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,025
This glass has ice cubes in it.

1080
01:06:36,029 --> 01:06:37,632
Yes, that's what happens when water gets cold.

1081
01:06:37,633 --> 01:06:39,751
No, what I'm saying is,

1082
01:06:39,752 --> 01:06:44,124
don't you think it's a little odd that
the ice hasn't melted yet?

1083
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,759
One of life's great mysteries.

1084
01:06:51,985 --> 01:06:53,168
Hey.

1085
01:06:53,170 --> 01:06:54,172
AAAAAAAAH!

1086
01:07:05,200 --> 01:07:07,050
We now have a confirmed report.

1087
01:07:07,051 --> 01:07:11,053
Tighten, first thought to be the
City's new hero, has turned evil.

1088
01:07:11,054 --> 01:07:13,975
The city has never seen this level
of destruction.

1089
01:07:13,976 --> 01:07:16,433
If only Metro Man were still alive.

1090
01:07:16,434 --> 01:07:18,119
-You're alive?
-You're alive.

1091
01:07:19,144 --> 01:07:20,108
I'm alive.

1092
01:07:20,110 --> 01:07:22,683
But..we..we
saw your skeleton.

1093
01:07:22,688 --> 01:07:24,858
-You were dead.
-Are you a ghost?

1094
01:07:23,661 --> 01:07:28,744
There had better be, an amazing
explanation for this.

1095
01:07:29,356 --> 01:07:31,331
Speak, apparition.

1096
01:07:40,867 --> 01:07:43,635
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1097
01:07:43,636 --> 01:07:45,069
You both deserve the truth.

1098
01:07:45,428 --> 01:07:47,619
It all started back at the observatory.

1099
01:07:48,623 --> 01:07:51,661
Roxanne was kidnapped, I was gonna
stop you.

1100
01:07:52,474 --> 01:07:54,550
My head wasn't in the game that day.

1101
01:07:55,131 --> 01:07:58,379
We were kinda going through the motions.
So...

1102
01:07:59,624 --> 01:08:01,120
Using my super speed.

1103
01:08:01,121 --> 01:08:03,076
I decided to go clear my head.

1104
01:08:04,351 --> 01:08:10,606
Then I realized we had done this same
silly charade our entire lives.

1105
01:08:11,229 --> 01:08:13,833
I tried to get my mind off how I was feeling.

1106
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,402
But I just felt stuck.

1107
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:20,694
I began to realize, despite all my powers,

1108
01:08:21,345 --> 01:08:24,230
each and every citizen of Metro had
something I didn't.

1109
01:08:24,882 --> 01:08:26,073
A choice.

1110
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:31,261
Ever since I can remember I've always
had to be what the City wanted me to be.

1111
01:08:32,114 --> 01:08:34,157
But what about what I wanted to do?

1112
01:08:35,321 --> 01:08:37,291
Then it suddenly hit me.

1113
01:08:37,969 --> 01:08:39,735
I do have a choice.

1114
01:08:40,568 --> 01:08:43,119
I can be whatever I want to be.

1115
01:08:43,538 --> 01:08:46,091
No one said this hero thing had to
be a life time gig.

1116
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,554
You can't just quit either.

1117
01:08:49,363 --> 01:08:51,528
That's when I got the brilliant idea...

1118
01:08:52,815 --> 01:08:54,219
...to fake my death.

1119
01:08:54,701 --> 01:08:57,685
Copper drains my powers!

1120
01:08:57,690 --> 01:09:00,385
-You're weakness is copper?

1121
01:09:00,386 --> 01:09:01,730
Once your death ray hit.

1122
01:09:02,518 --> 01:09:04,980
I never felt so alive.

1123
01:09:05,140 --> 01:09:08,032
So I borrowed a prop from a nearby
nursing school.

1124
01:09:08,434 --> 01:09:11,354
Metro Man was finally dead.

1125
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:13,122
And Music Man was born.

1126
01:09:13,124 --> 01:09:14,255
Music man?

1127
01:09:14,258 --> 01:09:15,716
That way I can keep my logo.

1128
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:16,720
-WHAT?
-'Cause of what?

1129
01:09:16,724 --> 01:09:20,408
Finally I'm free, to get in touch
with my true power.

1130
01:09:20,415 --> 01:09:22,596
Weaving lyrical magic.

1131
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:23,741
Check this out.

1132
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:27,584
<i>*I have eyes that can see*</i>

1133
01:09:27,585 --> 01:09:31,313
<i>*right through leaaadd.*</i>

1134
01:09:31,314 --> 01:09:33,910
-That's horrible.
-Granted you have talent,

1135
01:09:33,915 --> 01:09:37,622
But there's a mad man out there
destroying our...your city.

1136
01:09:38,609 --> 01:09:40,029
How could you do this?

1137
01:09:40,474 --> 01:09:43,008
The people of the city relied on you,

1138
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:47,024
and you deserted them.
You left us in the hands of, him!

1139
01:09:47,025 --> 01:09:48,124
No offense.

1140
01:09:48,127 --> 01:09:49,286
No, I'm with you.

1141
01:09:49,573 --> 01:09:51,670
Look, we need your help.

1142
01:09:51,677 --> 01:09:54,528
I'm sorry, I really am.

1143
01:09:54,529 --> 01:09:56,648
Um, I'm, I'm done.

1144
01:09:56,649 --> 01:10:00,729
You know, little buddy. There's a Ying
for every Yang.

1145
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:04,066
If there's bad, good will rise up
against it.

1146
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:07,558
It's taken me a long time to
find my calling.

1147
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:11,195
Now it's about time, you find yours.

1148
01:10:16,424 --> 01:10:18,163
Hey, who needs him.

1149
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:20,157
We can beat Tighten ourselves.

1150
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:23,029
I say we go back to the evil lair.
Grab some ray guns,

1151
01:10:23,032 --> 01:10:25,859
hold them sideways, and just go
all gangsta on 'em.

1152
01:10:26,675 --> 01:10:27,678
We can't

1153
01:10:27,681 --> 01:10:29,922
So that's it? You're just giving up?

1154
01:10:29,930 --> 01:10:31,662
I'm the bad guy.

1155
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:35,279
I don't save the day.
I don't fly off into the sunset,

1156
01:10:35,282 --> 01:10:37,470
and I don't get the girl.

1157
01:10:38,526 --> 01:10:39,530
I'm going home.

1158
01:11:09,494 --> 01:11:11,632
Unless someone comes
to our aid soon,

1159
01:11:11,638 --> 01:11:13,512
all may be lost.

1160
01:11:14,670 --> 01:11:17,941
Thousands have already fled the city
in a mass exodus.

1161
01:11:17,948 --> 01:11:22,080
Remaining citizens are warned, to stay
indoors until further notice.

1162
01:11:23,595 --> 01:11:28,746
Authorities have issued a warning, to stay
out of the downtown area at all costs.

1163
01:11:40,847 --> 01:11:41,854
Hal!

1164
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:44,562
Hal!

1165
01:11:45,743 --> 01:11:49,252
Let me guess, after seeing how awesome I am,

1166
01:11:49,253 --> 01:11:50,886
you've finally come to your senses.

1167
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:52,378
Well, I'm over you.

1168
01:11:52,380 --> 01:11:54,175
I've come to stop you, Hal.

1169
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:57,877
You? Oh, well. Okay, what are you
going to do, report me to death?

1170
01:11:57,878 --> 01:11:59,883
I was going to try
reasoning with you.

1171
01:12:00,132 --> 01:12:02,937
You and I, we worked together
for a long time.

1172
01:12:02,938 --> 01:12:04,357
I know you.

1173
01:12:04,358 --> 01:12:05,789
You don't know me.

1174
01:12:05,790 --> 01:12:08,216
You never took the time to know me.

1175
01:12:08,221 --> 01:12:12,894
This is the first time we've hung out socially.
And it's when I'm about to destroy the city.

1176
01:12:12,895 --> 01:12:14,374
I want to talk to the real Hal.

1177
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:18,357
I want to talk to the guy who loved being
a camera man, and eating dip,

1178
01:12:18,359 --> 01:12:22,050
And being a nerd and being not as scary
as the Tighten-Hal.

1179
01:12:22,052 --> 01:12:22,961
To late!

1180
01:12:30,297 --> 01:12:31,389
Megamind.

1181
01:12:33,288 --> 01:12:36,420
You and I have some unfinished business.

1182
01:12:36,421 --> 01:12:40,852
I'll be waiting at Metro Tower,
oh, and just so you don't get cold feet.

1183
01:12:42,660 --> 01:12:43,624
Roxanne!

1184
01:12:43,625 --> 01:12:47,695
Come on Roxi, call for your hero
to come rescue you.

1185
01:12:48,672 --> 01:12:49,940
Megamind.

1186
01:12:51,148 --> 01:12:53,534
I don't even know if you're listening,
but if you are...

1187
01:12:54,008 --> 01:12:56,148
You can't give up.

1188
01:12:57,623 --> 01:13:01,487
The Megamind I knew would never
have run from a fight.

1189
01:13:01,488 --> 01:13:05,216
Even when he knew he had absolutely
no chance of winning.

1190
01:13:05,334 --> 01:13:07,538
It was your best quality.

1191
01:13:07,858 --> 01:13:11,052
You need to be that guy,
right now.

1192
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:14,448
The city needs you.

1193
01:13:16,673 --> 01:13:18,255
I need you.

1194
01:13:18,256 --> 01:13:19,855
Roxanne.

1195
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:24,123
You have one hour.
Don't...keep me waiting.

1196
01:13:25,695 --> 01:13:27,512
Warden, Warden!

1197
01:13:27,513 --> 01:13:31,763
Listen to me, you have to let me go.
Tighten has to be stopped.

1198
01:13:31,764 --> 01:13:35,561
Sorry Megamind, you still have 88 life
sentences to go.

1199
01:13:35,562 --> 01:13:38,071
Plenty of time to reflect on what
you've done.

1200
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:41,587
If you want to hear me say it?
I'll say it.

1201
01:13:41,589 --> 01:13:45,256
Here it is. From the blackest part of my heart.

1202
01:13:47,874 --> 01:13:51,718
I....AM....Sorry!

1203
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:55,134
Not buying it.

1204
01:13:57,526 --> 01:13:59,144
I don't blame you.

1205
01:14:00,402 --> 01:14:03,124
I've terrorized the city
countless times.

1206
01:14:03,516 --> 01:14:06,636
Created a hero who's turned out
to be a villain.

1207
01:14:06,644 --> 01:14:09,798
I lied to Roxanne.

1208
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:13,317
My best friend, Minion.

1209
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,385
I treated like dirt.

1210
01:14:17,481 --> 01:14:19,539
Please, don't make this city,

1211
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:24,465
don't make Roxanne pay for my
wrong doings.

1212
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:29,966
Apology accepted.

1213
01:14:33,264 --> 01:14:36,790
Uh, Minion. You fantastic fish, you.

1214
01:14:36,791 --> 01:14:38,210
What are we waiting for?

1215
01:14:38,211 --> 01:14:40,063
We'd better get going.

1216
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:43,888
You got me!

1217
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:48,269
Good luck, fellows.

1218
01:14:48,270 --> 01:14:49,506
We're gonna die!

1219
01:14:51,078 --> 01:14:52,335
Wait, what?

1220
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:54,281
Hey, Metro losers.

1221
01:14:54,282 --> 01:14:56,165
This is Metro Tower.

1222
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:59,415
They say it's suppose to be a
symbol of our cities strength.

1223
01:14:59,416 --> 01:15:04,762
But, for me, it's a reminder of the day
this woman ferociously ripped out my heart.

1224
01:15:04,764 --> 01:15:07,306
And I hate reminders.

1225
01:15:20,352 --> 01:15:21,528
HAL!

1226
01:15:23,824 --> 01:15:25,054
Please don't do this.

1227
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:27,762
I know there's still good in you, Hal.

1228
01:15:27,764 --> 01:15:29,261
You're so naive, Roxie.

1229
01:15:29,262 --> 01:15:32,711
You see the good in everybody,
even when it's not there.

1230
01:15:32,712 --> 01:15:34,587
You're living a fantasy.

1231
01:15:35,022 --> 01:15:36,681
There is no Easter bunny.

1232
01:15:36,682 --> 01:15:38,433
There is no tooth fairy.

1233
01:15:38,434 --> 01:15:40,359
And there is no Queen of England.

1234
01:15:40,937 --> 01:15:44,091
This is the real world.
And you need to wake up.

1235
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:59,255
You dare challenge Megamind?

1236
01:15:59,587 --> 01:16:02,253
This town isn't big enough for
two super villains.

1237
01:16:02,256 --> 01:16:05,634
Oh, you're a villain all right.

1238
01:16:05,636 --> 01:16:07,664
Just not a super one.

1239
01:16:07,665 --> 01:16:09,434
Yeah, what's the difference?

1240
01:16:13,697 --> 01:16:15,377
PRESENTATION!

1241
01:16:34,864 --> 01:16:36,042
I knew you'd come back.

1242
01:16:36,043 --> 01:16:38,200
Well, that makes one of us.

1243
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:09,600
-What's the plan?
-Well, mostly involves, not dying.

1244
01:17:09,601 --> 01:17:10,769
I, like that plan.

1245
01:17:34,852 --> 01:17:36,476
I can't control it.

1246
01:17:51,793 --> 01:17:52,715
No!

1247
01:17:55,985 --> 01:17:57,211
Well, that was easy.

1248
01:17:57,637 --> 01:17:59,864
Looks like there's only one loose
end now.

1249
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:14,168
Please, let's have a little respect
for public transportation.

1250
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:16,634
You came back.

1251
01:18:16,635 --> 01:18:18,196
You were right, Roxanne.

1252
01:18:18,197 --> 01:18:20,142
I never should have left.

1253
01:18:20,143 --> 01:18:22,387
Whoa, I...I thought you were dead.

1254
01:18:22,388 --> 01:18:25,676
My death was, greatly exaggerated.

1255
01:18:25,677 --> 01:18:29,064
So, you're the punk I've heard about.

1256
01:18:30,814 --> 01:18:31,790
Ah!

1257
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:45,593
I'm sorry, I did the best I could.

1258
01:18:47,257 --> 01:18:48,981
I'm so proud of you.

1259
01:18:53,001 --> 01:18:54,116
Minion?

1260
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,521
Surprise! Heh, heh, heh.

1261
01:18:57,966 --> 01:19:00,253
He's the real hero.

1262
01:19:06,972 --> 01:19:08,312
Megamind.

1263
01:19:09,950 --> 01:19:11,158
Going somewhere?

1264
01:19:12,058 --> 01:19:13,674
Besides jail.

1265
01:19:21,124 --> 01:19:23,219
No, not in the face man, please.

1266
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,654
If you know what's good
for you, Tighten.

1267
01:19:24,655 --> 01:19:26,468
You'll stay out of Montrosity.

1268
01:19:26,469 --> 01:19:27,796
-You got it!
-For good.

1269
01:20:03,110 --> 01:20:04,610
Pretty sneaky, sis.

1270
01:20:05,211 --> 01:20:08,688
But there is only one person I
know who calls this town, Montrosity.

1271
01:20:08,689 --> 01:20:09,692
Ooops.

1272
01:20:10,356 --> 01:20:11,327
You!

1273
01:20:14,423 --> 01:20:16,420
Bet you think it's really funny, huh?

1274
01:20:18,098 --> 01:20:20,724
Let's all laugh at the really cool guy, huh.

1275
01:20:23,765 --> 01:20:25,731
You're not going to be laughing for long.

1276
01:20:26,506 --> 01:20:30,034
The invisible car. Hey, remember
that night that I dumped you?

1277
01:20:31,215 --> 01:20:33,292
You are bringing this up now?

1278
01:20:33,293 --> 01:20:34,803
I did look back.

1279
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:37,509
You did?

1280
01:20:37,510 --> 01:20:39,057
YOU DID!

1281
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:42,697
Yes, and you should look back,
right now.

1282
01:20:43,807 --> 01:20:45,335
Oh, I get it.

1283
01:20:53,424 --> 01:20:55,940
This is the last time you'll make
a fool out of me.

1284
01:20:55,941 --> 01:20:58,374
I made you a hero.

1285
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:02,128
You did the fool thing,
all by yourself.

1286
01:21:08,876 --> 01:21:10,502
You're so pathetic.

1287
01:21:10,503 --> 01:21:12,331
No matter what side you're on.

1288
01:21:12,332 --> 01:21:14,139
You're always the looser.

1289
01:21:14,501 --> 01:21:16,332
There's a benefit to loosing.

1290
01:21:16,636 --> 01:21:18,812
You get to learn from your mistakes.

1291
01:21:21,053 --> 01:21:22,053
What?

1292
01:21:23,926 --> 01:21:25,961
Oh, you've got to be kidding me!

1293
01:21:25,962 --> 01:21:28,342
Minion, if I live, I will kill you.

1294
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:40,491
Enjoy your flight.

1295
01:21:41,036 --> 01:21:42,250
AAAAAAAAH!

1296
01:21:42,357 --> 01:21:43,852
Megamind.

1297
01:21:51,443 --> 01:21:53,896
So, this is how it ends.

1298
01:21:54,349 --> 01:21:58,398
Normally I'd chalk this up to my last
glorious failure.

1299
01:21:59,868 --> 01:22:01,180
But not today!

1300
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,418
What can I say?

1301
01:22:03,843 --> 01:22:05,626
Old habits die hard.

1302
01:22:12,273 --> 01:22:14,313
Say bye, bye Roxie.

1303
01:22:19,151 --> 01:22:20,491
Ollo.

1304
01:22:29,809 --> 01:22:32,911
Thing about bad guys,
they always LOOSE!

1305
01:22:33,846 --> 01:22:35,133
Ohhhh.

1306
01:22:37,847 --> 01:22:39,813
We did it, you won.

1307
01:22:39,814 --> 01:22:43,055
Well, I finally had a reason to win.

1308
01:22:44,074 --> 01:22:45,247
You.

1309
01:22:53,554 --> 01:22:54,557
MINION!

1310
01:22:54,586 --> 01:22:59,494
Can't see it's cold and...
warm, and dark and light.

1311
01:22:59,502 --> 01:23:00,914
It's me, Minion.

1312
01:23:00,917 --> 01:23:02,312
I'm right here.

1313
01:23:02,316 --> 01:23:04,319
We've had a lot of adventures together.

1314
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:05,529
You and I.

1315
01:23:05,531 --> 01:23:06,759
We have, Minion.

1316
01:23:06,760 --> 01:23:09,295
I mean...

1317
01:23:09,301 --> 01:23:13,810
most of them ended in horrible
failure, but,

1318
01:23:13,817 --> 01:23:17,596
We won today.
Didn't we, sir?

1319
01:23:17,597 --> 01:23:20,121
Yes Minion, we did it.

1320
01:23:20,126 --> 01:23:21,501
Thanks to you.

1321
01:23:21,504 --> 01:23:25,462
Code-We're the good guys now.

1322
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:29,742
Code-I guess we are.

1323
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:33,033
Oh, oh. I'm going...I think this...

1324
01:23:33,038 --> 01:23:35,759
This is it, I  mean I'm going far awa...

1325
01:23:46,197 --> 01:23:48,141
Oh, what a drama queen.

1326
01:23:48,969 --> 01:23:50,736
You know, I'm feeling much better now.

1327
01:23:50,746 --> 01:23:52,526
I guess I just needed a swim

1328
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:54,338
-He had you, didn't he.
-Whew!

1329
01:23:54,341 --> 01:23:56,882
Classic, Minion.
Don't give them the face.

1330
01:23:56,888 --> 01:23:59,355
There he is with that
little face. Look at that face.

1331
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,826
We did it!
We did it!

1332
01:24:01,829 --> 01:24:03,941
-Fist pump!
-You did it!

1333
01:24:03,945 --> 01:24:05,806
We won, we won, we won.

1334
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:09,862
What! Get back you savages!

1335
01:24:09,868 --> 01:24:13,932
Sorry, sorry. He's just not used to
positive feedback.

1336
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:21,826
Funny, I guess destiny is not the
path given to us.

1337
01:24:24,390 --> 01:24:26,891
But the path we choose
for ourselves.

1338
01:24:35,125 --> 01:24:37,250
All right, put your hands in the air.

1339
01:24:40,808 --> 01:24:42,762
Now hand over your wallets.

1340
01:24:42,763 --> 01:24:45,625
I'm just kidding.

1341
01:24:45,626 --> 01:24:47,309
Just kidding.

1342
01:24:47,313 --> 01:24:48,910
I have to admit.

1343
01:24:48,914 --> 01:24:51,873
Being good, has its perks.

1344
01:24:53,070 --> 01:24:55,713
You know, you look pretty good
in white.

1345
01:24:56,025 --> 01:24:59,883
Megamind, if you please.

1346
01:25:03,568 --> 01:25:05,799
Uh, hey, my kid can't see.

1347
01:25:05,803 --> 01:25:07,871
Sorry my friend.

1348
01:25:07,876 --> 01:25:11,936
Way to go, little buddy.
I knew you had it in you.

1349
01:25:11,942 --> 01:25:15,179
Ladies and gentlemen...
MEGAMIND!

1350
01:25:15,186 --> 01:25:17,919
Defender of Metro City.

1351
01:25:19,763 --> 01:25:22,816
You know, I like the sound of that.

1352
01:25:23,167 --> 01:25:24,200
Hit it!

1353
01:25:25,031 --> 01:25:28,327
