1
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,909
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,995
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,358
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,514
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,035
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,434
I only meant...

7
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,433
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,875
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,430
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:58,194
Exactly as I said.

11
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,115
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:05,192
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,510
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,116
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,795
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:31,114
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,992
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

18
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,233
Harry.

19
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,552
Harry!

20
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,518
Are you all right?

21
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,236
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,597
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,954
Last night.

24
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,270
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,634
Bloody hell.

26
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,233
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,632
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,997
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,119
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,711
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,313
Keep up!

32
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,552
Arthur!

33
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,631
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,998
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,598
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,189
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,475
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,232
This way.

39
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,111
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,919
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,798
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,914
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,792
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,075
We don't want to be late.

45
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,233
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,430
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,989
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,434
Time to go!

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,158
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,199
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,395
...three!

52
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,069
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,708
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,748
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,149
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,756
Go on, look at that!

57
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,312
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,794
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,428
Look!

60
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,475
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,433
Blimey!

62
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,397
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,879
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,314
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,072
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,511
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,719
What?

68
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,637
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,074
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,629
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,509
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,069
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,435
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,670
I love magic.

75
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,631
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,957
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,473
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,358
If it rains...

79
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,750
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,795
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,111
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,350
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,556
There's no need with these people.

84
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,309
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,472
While you can.

86
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,791
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,757
Come on!

88
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,797
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,712
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,913
<i>Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!</i>

91
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,072
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,199
Who's that?

93
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,838
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,190
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

95
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,909
Krum!

96
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,752
Yes!

97
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,991
Good evening!

98
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:02,398
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,512
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,715
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,512
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,439
Let the match...

103
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,313
...begin!

104
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,270
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

105
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,392
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,118
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,192
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,158
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,639
He's an artist.

110
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,870
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,479
<i>Viktor, I love you</i>

112
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,198
<i>Viktor, I do</i>

113
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,432
<i>When we're apart
My heart beats only for you</i>

114
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,194
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,992
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,033
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,190
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,515
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,877
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,634
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,838
Go!

122
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,752
Harry!

123
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,030
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,276
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,433
<i>Morsmordre!</i>

126
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,513
Harry!

127
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,032
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,754
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,552
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,271
What is that?

131
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,231
<i>Stupefy!</i>

132
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,674
Stop!

133
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,956
That's my son!

134
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,554
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,908
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,196
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,237
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,356
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,953
What crime?

140
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,509
It's the Dark Mark, Harry.
It's his mark.

141
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,795
What, Voldemort?

142
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,629
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,916
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,917
Death Eaters.

145
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,474
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,234
There!

147
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,630
All of you, this way!

148
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,719
A man, Harry?

149
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,399
Who?

150
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,518
I don't know.

151
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,196
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,752
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,712
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,152
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,436
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,318
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,711
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,714
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,229
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,958
Thank you.

161
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,676
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,710
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,511
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,636
This is horrible.

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,594
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,472
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,313
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,268
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,076
It's hurting again, isn't it?
Your scar.

170
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,832
I'm fine.

171
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,553
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,554
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,712
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,475
Clear the runway!

175
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,319
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:54,030
<i>Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.</i>

177
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,276
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,477
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,268
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,673
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,199
What is it?

182
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,637
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,511
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,636
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,151
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,357
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,556
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,030
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,918
Now let me be clear.

190
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,878
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,871
And trust me when I say...

192
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,918
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:47,352
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:51,399
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,348
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,879
Bloody hell.

197
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,670
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,791
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,679
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,513
...and their high master,
Igor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,153
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,719
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,677
Viktor Krum!

204
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,593
Albus.

205
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,398
Igor.

206
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,995
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,594
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,150
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,470
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,155
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,792
You idiot!

212
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,511
Your attention, please!

213
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,836
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,476
Eternal glory.

215
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,799
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,999
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:28,869
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,395
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,553
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,039
To explain all this...

221
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,670
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,876
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,314
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:02,152
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,630
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,312
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:24,195
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,429
Thank you.

229
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,477
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,758
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,317
After due consideration...

232
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,233
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,233
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,995
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,754
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,388
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,155
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,069
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:28,393
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,358
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,478
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,676
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,476
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,395
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,471
Alastor Moody.

246
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,878
Ex-Auror...

247
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,829
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,349
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,798
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,632
Any questions?

251
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,352
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,274
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,872
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,590
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,877
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

256
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:53,953
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,799
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,270
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,510
You need to be prepared.

260
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:05,035
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,395
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,438
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,792
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,436
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,749
- Weasley!
- Yes?

266
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,194
Stand.

267
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,958
Give us a curse.

268
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:29,795
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,554
The Imperius Curse.

270
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,837
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,874
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,669
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,274
Hello.

274
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,478
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,391
<i>Engorgio.</i>

276
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,352
<i>Imperio!</i>

277
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,915
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,432
If she bites...

279
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,393
...she's lethal.

280
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,552
What are you laughing at?

281
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:22,193
Get off!

282
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,238
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,631
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,879
Drown herself?

285
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:47,317
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,314
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,630
...under the influence
of the Imperius Curse.

288
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,631
But here's the rub:

289
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,838
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,718
Another, another.

291
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,159
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,799
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,873
Up.

294
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,469
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,952
There's the...

296
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,037
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,919
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,678
Particularly nasty.

299
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,352
The torture curse.

300
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,390
<i>Crucio!</i>

301
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:48,229
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,994
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,594
No?

304
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,796
<i>Avada Kedavra!</i>

305
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,879
The Killing Curse.

306
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,997
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,795
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,792
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,839
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,037
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,668
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,833
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,999
Neville?

314
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,559
Son?

315
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,472
You all right?

316
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,631
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:41,471
We're gonna be late!

318
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,750
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,109
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,874
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,558
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,551
Yes!

323
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,511
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,592
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,830
It's not going to work.

326
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,389
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,393
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,278
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,839
So?

330
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,830
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,878
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,113
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,711
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,632
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,751
- Yes!
- Yes!

336
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,993
Yeah!

337
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,678
Yes!

338
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,513
Ready?

339
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,750
- Yes!
- Yes!

340
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,831
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,036
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

342
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,589
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,159
<i>Fight! Fight! Fight!</i>

344
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,712
We're "old school," right?

345
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,155
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,834
Sit down. Please.

347
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,833
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,036
The champion selection.

349
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,835
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,429
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,511
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,518
The Hogwarts champion,
Cedric Diggory!

353
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:43,392
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,553
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,917
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,118
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,396
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,512
Harry Potter.

359
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,078
Harry Potter?

360
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,396
No. No.

361
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,108
Harry Potter!

362
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,993
Go on, Harry.

363
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,832
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,189
He's a cheat!

365
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,154
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,236
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,278
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- Quiet! I can't think!

368
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,351
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,635
- Harry.
- I protest!

370
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,597
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,830
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,274
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,238
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,790
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,230
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,437
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could've hoodwinked it.

377
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,511
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,558
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,757
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,878
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,790
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,196
The rules are absolute.

383
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,955
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,516
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,475
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,191
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,036
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,079
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,151
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,271
Put an end to it.

391
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,631
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,155
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,039
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,555
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:35,554
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,474
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,076
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,110
...let them unfold.

399
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,350
What...? Do nothing?

400
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,112
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,799
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,279
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,519
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,155
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,392
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,514
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,268
Then again, we all are.

408
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,278
How did you do it?

409
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,194
Never mind. Doesn't matter.

410
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,191
Might've let
your best friend know, though.

411
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,477
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

412
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,915
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

413
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,918
Okay?

414
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,469
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

415
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,030
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

416
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,471
I didn't put my name in that cup.

417
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,555
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

418
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,595
Look, I don't know
what happened tonight...

419
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,557
...and I don't know why.

420
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,869
It just did.

421
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,233
Okay?

422
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,352
Piss off.

423
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,115
What a charismatic quartet.

424
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,958
Hello.

425
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,234
I'm Rita Skeeter.

426
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,189
<i>I write for the Daily Prophet.</i>

427
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,276
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

428
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,552
You're the juicy news.

429
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,759
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

430
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,276
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

431
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,512
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

432
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,592
In short, what makes a champion tick?

433
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:09,198
"Me, Myself & I" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

434
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,749
So who's feeling up to sharing?

435
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,434
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

436
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,918
This is cozy.

437
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,118
It's a broom cupboard.

438
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,675
You should feel right at home, then.

439
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:38,519
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

440
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,193
No.

441
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,431
So tell me, Harry.

442
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,398
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

443
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,993
I'm 14. Sorry.

444
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,993
- About to compete
against three students...

445
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,311
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

446
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:55,948
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

447
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,350
...in your dizziest daydreams.

448
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,796
Concerned?

449
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,639
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

450
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,597
Just ignore the quill.

451
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,474
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

452
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,108
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

453
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,910
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

454
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:18,197
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

455
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,032
No, I didn't enter.

456
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,758
Of course you didn't.

457
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,478
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

458
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,119
Scratch that last.

459
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:32,514
Speaking of your parents,
were they alive...

460
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:33,959
...how do you think they'd feel?

461
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,792
Proud? Or concerned...

462
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:39,635
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

463
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,268
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

464
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:48,109
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past. "

465
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,310
<i>Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.</i>

466
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:24,631
<i>Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...</i>

467
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,916
<i>...and she's too easily recognized.</i>

468
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,833
<i>We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.</i>

469
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,993
<i>Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.</i>

470
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:35,878
<i>And make sure you're alone.</i>

471
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,473
<i>Sirius.</i>

472
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:39,073
<i>P. S:</i>

473
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,958
<i>The bird bites.</i>

474
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,233
Sirius?

475
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,271
<i>Harry Potter, age 12...</i>

476
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,273
<i>...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.</i>

477
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,908
<i>His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...</i>

478
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,593
<i>...and choking back tears...</i>

479
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,908
Sirius. How...?

480
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,469
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

481
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,473
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

482
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,039
No!

483
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,828
I had to ask.

484
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,596
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

485
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:51,069
But who was the third man in the room?

486
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,629
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

487
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,919
No.

488
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,349
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

489
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,748
And what was that?

490
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,438
He wanted...

491
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,192
...me.

492
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,872
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

493
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:15,111
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

494
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,118
Yes.

495
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,759
It's just a dream.

496
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,833
Look, Harry.

497
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,356
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

498
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,354
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

499
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,555
What are you saying?

500
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:33,793
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

501
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,158
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

502
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:41,034
Then there's Barty Crouch.
Heart of stone.

503
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,475
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

504
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,151
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

505
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,515
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

506
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:56,514
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

507
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,956
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

508
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,709
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

509
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,757
- Who were you talking to?
- What?

510
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,229
- Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

511
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,354
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

512
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,077
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

513
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,518
Amazing.

514
00:43:49,400 --> 00:43:52,949
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

515
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,833
Right, sorry.

516
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,558
<i>"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?</i>

517
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,757
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

518
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,838
It's already been through enough people.

519
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,036
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

520
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,670
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

521
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,831
What do you want me to say again?

522
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,274
Go.

523
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:21,033
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

524
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:25,110
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

525
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,589
Is that right? Well, you...

526
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,795
What?

527
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,513
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

528
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,033
Dean was told by Parvati that...

529
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,356
Please don't ask me to say it again.

530
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,119
Hagrid's looking for you.

531
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,558
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

532
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,830
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

533
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,468
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

534
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:06,993
You'll see soon enough.

535
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,276
Now pay attention, this is important.

536
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,273
What's with the flower?

537
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,629
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

538
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,678
As a matter of fact, I have.

539
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,918
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

540
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,479
Hagrid?

541
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,992
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

542
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:45,596
<i>- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.</i>

543
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:49,309
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

544
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,074
...you had forgotten me.

545
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,077
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

546
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,392
What is it you wanted to show me?

547
00:45:58,080 --> 00:46:01,152
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

548
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:02,913
...exhilarated.

549
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:06,199
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

550
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:18,032
Can we get closer?

551
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,919
Dragons?

552
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,513
That's the first task?

553
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,797
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

554
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,992
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

555
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,473
Oh, crikey!

556
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,991
Although, I have to admit...

557
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,879
...that Horntail is a right nasty
piece of work.

558
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,679
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

559
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,156
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

560
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,676
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

561
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:54,159
Didn't Ron tell you that?

562
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,433
No, he didn't.

563
00:46:58,120 --> 00:46:59,917
He didn't tell me a thing.

564
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:12,438
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

565
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,474
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

566
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,194
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

567
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,792
Like the badge?

568
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,992
Excuse me.

569
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,399
Harry.

570
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,837
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

571
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,433
Can I have a word?

572
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:36,157
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

573
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:39,198
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

574
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:44,034
Dragons. That's the first task.

575
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,237
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

576
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,311
Are you serious?

577
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,992
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

578
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,310
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

579
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:56,879
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

580
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,429
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

581
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,512
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

582
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,989
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

583
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,079
It just happens a fair bit.

584
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,198
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

585
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,157
You're a right foul git, you know that?

586
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,436
- You think so?
- I know so.

587
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:15,874
Anything else?

588
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,396
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

589
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:25,150
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

590
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,189
My father and I have a bet, you see.

591
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,397
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

592
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:36,678
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

593
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,832
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

594
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,634
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

595
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,909
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

596
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,833
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

597
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,675
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

598
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,512
- Professor Moody!
... back-shooting...

599
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,478
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

600
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:06,433
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

601
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,677
Stand still! Stand still!

602
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,316
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

603
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,357
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

604
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,272
Professor!

605
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:33,876
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

606
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:36,634
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

607
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:40,429
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

608
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,716
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

609
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:47,518
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

610
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:49,959
Away!

611
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,076
You. Come with me.

612
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,831
That's a Foe-Glass.

613
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,551
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

614
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,232
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

615
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,595
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

616
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,716
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

617
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,598
Now...

618
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,919
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

619
00:50:56,680 --> 00:50:58,875
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

620
00:51:00,280 --> 00:51:01,713
Sit.

621
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:06,599
Listen to me, Potter.

622
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:08,675
Your pal Diggory?

623
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:13,072
By your age, he could turn a whistle into
a watch and have it sing you the time.

624
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,434
Miss Delacour?

625
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,434
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

626
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:22,356
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

627
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:24,590
...but Karkaroff's is not.

628
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,512
They'll have a strategy.

629
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:29,990
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

630
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:36,153
Come on, Potter.

631
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:38,311
What are your strengths?

632
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,159
I don't know.

633
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,993
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

634
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,039
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

635
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,670
You're allowed a wand.

636
00:51:57,840 --> 00:51:59,239
Bets! Place your bets!

637
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,470
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

638
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:04,473
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

639
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,313
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

640
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,993
Yes, sir?

641
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,914
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

642
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,277
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

643
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:16,994
<i>This is a great day for all of us.</i>

644
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:24,353
<i>Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.</i>

645
00:52:24,520 --> 00:52:27,114
<i>Please keep your seats at all times.</i>

646
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,879
<i>This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.</i>

647
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:33,316
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

648
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,118
<i>I'm sure we all wish our champions...</i>

649
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,238
<i>- How are you feeling? Okay?
- ... the greatest of luck.</i>

650
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,716
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

651
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,632
Battle a dragon.

652
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,115
Young love.

653
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,034
How...

654
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,628
...stirring.

655
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:03,237
If everything goes unfortunately today...

656
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:06,073
...you two may even
make the front page.

657
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:08,356
You have no business here.

658
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:10,431
This tent is for champions...

659
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,438
...and friends.

660
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:19,113
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

661
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:24,839
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

662
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:28,993
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

663
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:32,277
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

664
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:34,476
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

665
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:37,312
Sorry, I'll just go.

666
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,959
Barty, the bag.

667
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,516
Champions, in a circle around me.

668
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,672
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

669
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:48,594
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

670
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,069
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

671
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,592
The Welsh Green.

672
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,268
Mr. Krum.

673
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,991
The Chinese Fireball.

674
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,509
The Swedish Short-Snout.

675
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,871
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

676
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,190
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

677
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:25,789
The Hungarian Horntail.

678
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,872
These represent four
very real dragons...

679
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,952
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

680
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,509
Your objective is simple:

681
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,113
Collect the egg.

682
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,158
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

683
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:44,676
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

684
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,114
Any questions?

685
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,674
Very well. Good luck, champions.

686
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,473
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

687
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:04,475
<i>Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!</i>

688
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,791
<i>Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...</i>

689
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,316
<i>...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.</i>

690
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,838
<i>And now our fourth
and final contestant.</i>

691
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,156
<i>Harry! Harry! Harry!</i>

692
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:38,318
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

693
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,756
<i>Accio Firebolt!</i>

694
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:10,630
- Yeah!
- Yes!

695
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,553
Oh, my God.

696
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:32,951
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

697
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,830
Yes! Yes!

698
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:25,674
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die. Lose a leg.

699
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:27,717
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

700
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:29,552
- Never!
- Never!

701
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,834
Shush!

702
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:35,914
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

703
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,559
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

704
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,749
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

705
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,789
What the bloody hell was that?

706
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,399
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

707
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:06,439
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

708
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:13,234
I reckon you have to be barking mad to
put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

709
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,234
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

710
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,356
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

711
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:21,670
Everyone was saying it
behind your back.

712
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:26,917
Brilliant.
That makes me feel loads better.

713
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:31,031
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

714
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:32,633
No, no, no, I did.

715
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:35,712
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

716
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,759
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

717
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:43,708
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

718
01:01:44,680 --> 01:01:47,558
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

719
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,671
...after you'd figured that out.

720
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:52,634
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

721
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:54,593
That's completely mental.

722
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,672
Yeah. Isn't it?

723
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,796
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

724
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:03,918
Boys.

725
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,753
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

726
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:34,754
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

727
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,158
Shush.

728
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:42,114
Look at this!

729
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,429
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

730
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,590
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

731
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,399
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

732
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:54,755
Her latest prey, sources report...

733
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:58,390
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

734
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:02,434
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow. "

735
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,637
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

736
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:07,233
Thank you, Nigel.

737
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,559
Not now, Nigel. Later.

738
01:03:16,320 --> 01:03:17,799
Go on.

739
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:25,559
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

740
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,352
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

741
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:38,912
Mum sent me a dress.

742
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,755
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

743
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,952
Nose down, Harry.

744
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:49,189
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

745
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:52,672
What are you on about?

746
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:54,717
They're not for Ginny.

747
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,154
They're for you.

748
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:00,755
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

749
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:04,030
The Yule Ball...

750
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:09,354
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

751
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,991
...since its inception.

752
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:16,349
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

753
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,112
...gather in the Great Hall...

754
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:22,159
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

755
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:25,790
As representatives of the host school...

756
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:30,795
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

757
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:33,674
And I mean this literally, because...

758
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,118
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

759
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:40,353
...a dance.

760
01:04:44,440 --> 01:04:46,158
Silence!

761
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,238
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

762
01:04:49,400 --> 01:04:51,914
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

763
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:55,993
I will not have you, in the course of a
single evening, besmirching that name...

764
01:04:56,160 --> 01:05:00,199
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

765
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,757
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

766
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:04,353
Now, to dance...

767
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:08,069
...is to let the body breathe.

768
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:11,437
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

769
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,875
...longing to burst forth
and take flight.

770
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,874
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

771
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:21,032
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

772
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,350
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

773
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,829
Will you join me, please?

774
01:05:30,280 --> 01:05:33,636
Now, place your right hand
on my waist.

775
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,268
- Where?
- My waist.

776
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:38,874
And extend your arm.

777
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:41,197
Mr. Filch, if you please.

778
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,071
One, two, three.

779
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,596
One, two, three. One, two, three.

780
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:55,196
Never gonna let him forget this,
are you?

781
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:56,475
- Never.
- Never.

782
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,349
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

783
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:24,357
Why do they have to travel in packs?

784
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:27,034
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

785
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,956
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

786
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:40,270
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

787
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:47,719
I take after my mum.

788
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:51,668
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

789
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,671
No, not the maternal sort, her.

790
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:57,276
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

791
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:01,797
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

792
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:04,190
He laughed so hard at that.

793
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:07,957
Very funny.

794
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:17,235
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

795
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:20,312
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

796
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:22,790
But enough of me. What about you?

797
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:44,229
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

798
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,034
Well, us and Neville.

799
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,794
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

800
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,677
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

801
01:07:58,040 --> 01:07:59,712
Now I'm really depressed.

802
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,596
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone. "

803
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,511
Who you going with, then?

804
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,758
<i>- Oi, Angelina?
- What?</i>

805
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:21,994
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

806
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:23,992
To the ball?

807
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,513
Yeah, all right.

808
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,599
Oi, Hermione.

809
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,352
You're a girl.

810
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:33,794
Very well spotted.

811
01:08:33,960 --> 01:08:35,791
Come with one of us?

812
01:08:40,240 --> 01:08:43,038
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

813
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:44,633
For a girl, it's just sad.

814
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,395
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

815
01:08:55,080 --> 01:08:56,991
And I said yes!

816
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,273
Bloody hell.

817
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:02,032
She's lying, right?

818
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,349
If you say so.

819
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:07,237
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

820
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,391
Tonight, when we get back
to the common room...

821
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:11,198
...we'll both have partners. Agreed?

822
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:12,793
Agreed.

823
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,434
- Cho!
- Harry!

824
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:43,479
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

825
01:09:43,640 --> 01:09:45,153
Okay, thanks.

826
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:50,429
Cho?

827
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,839
Yes?

828
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,310
Well, I just wondered if you...

829
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:59,119
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

830
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,910
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

831
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:08,510
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

832
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:15,793
Harry...

833
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:18,679
...I'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

834
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:20,993
And...

835
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,757
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

836
01:10:26,360 --> 01:10:28,749
Okay. Yeah. Great.

837
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:32,674
Fine. No problem.

838
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,513
Okay. Good.

839
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:37,399
Harry?

840
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,718
I really am...

841
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:41,472
...sorry.

842
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:52,273
It's all right, Ron.

843
01:10:52,440 --> 01:10:55,512
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

844
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,477
What happened to you?

845
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,790
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

846
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,349
- What?
- What did she say?

847
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:03,839
No, of course.

848
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:08,517
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

849
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:13,152
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

850
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:17,350
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

851
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,796
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

852
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:25,430
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

853
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:29,149
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

854
01:11:29,320 --> 01:11:30,514
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

855
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,638
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

856
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,354
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

857
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:38,909
Hey!

858
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:56,958
Bloody hell.

859
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:00,798
Bloody hell.

860
01:12:04,160 --> 01:12:05,388
Bloody...

861
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:06,709
Oh, bloody...

862
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:12,874
What are those? What are those?

863
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:15,952
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

864
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:18,918
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

865
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,991
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

866
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:25,870
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

867
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:31,158
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

868
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,472
Murder me, Harry.

869
01:12:38,800 --> 01:12:40,313
Leave it alone!

870
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:44,516
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

871
01:12:44,680 --> 01:12:47,069
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

872
01:12:47,240 --> 01:12:50,676
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

873
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:52,956
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

874
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,989
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

875
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,273
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

876
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,192
Don't you look...

877
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,875
...dashing.

878
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:07,477
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

879
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,392
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

880
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:12,472
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

881
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:13,629
- Are the first to dance.

882
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:16,428
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

883
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:18,712
Well, now you know.

884
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:24,269
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

885
01:13:24,440 --> 01:13:26,670
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

886
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:28,359
Come along this way.

887
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,752
Oh, come on.

888
01:13:35,560 --> 01:13:37,471
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

889
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:40,871
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

890
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,309
This way. This way. Come along.

891
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,070
She looks beautiful!

892
01:13:49,240 --> 01:13:50,753
Yeah, she does.

893
01:14:36,200 --> 01:14:39,636
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

894
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:42,708
No. Absolutely not.

895
01:14:47,240 --> 01:14:48,719
Hi!

896
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,997
Harry, take my waist.

897
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:01,233
- What?
- Now!

898
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,792
Are you ready?

899
01:16:07,400 --> 01:16:09,516
<i>Move your body like a hairy troll</i>

900
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,675
<i>Learning to rock and roll</i>

901
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:15,548
<i>Spin around like a crazy elf</i>

902
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,190
<i>Dancing by himself</i>

903
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:21,677
<i>Boogie down like a unicorn</i>

904
01:16:21,840 --> 01:16:24,195
<i>No stopping till the break of dawn</i>

905
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,079
<i>Put your hands up in the air</i>

906
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,913
<i>Like an ogre who just don't care</i>

907
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:33,194
<i>Can you dance like a Hippogriff?</i>

908
01:16:35,400 --> 01:16:37,470
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

909
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:42,836
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

910
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:46,159
May I have your arm?

911
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,914
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

912
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,313
Hot, isn't it?

913
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:19,157
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

914
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:22,835
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

915
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,710
What's got your wand in a knot?

916
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:30,515
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

917
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,116
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

918
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:37,155
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

919
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:40,676
...is international
magical cooperation...

920
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,673
...to make friends.

921
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,437
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

922
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:58,230
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

923
01:17:58,400 --> 01:17:59,753
No.

924
01:18:07,680 --> 01:18:09,989
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

925
01:18:10,160 --> 01:18:14,199
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

926
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,875
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

927
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:20,076
You know the solution then, don't you?

928
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:22,151
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

929
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:25,312
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

930
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:27,436
And not as a last resort.

931
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,639
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

932
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,074
Harry.

933
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:34,748
Where have you been?

934
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,309
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

935
01:18:40,040 --> 01:18:43,874
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

936
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,837
What's this about?

937
01:18:49,960 --> 01:18:52,838
<i>No, don't let</i>

938
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,712
<i>This magic die</i>

939
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:03,073
<i>The answer's there</i>

940
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:00,991
Let me see it again.

941
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:05,033
Yes, the time is close now.

942
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,312
<i>Harry, at last!</i>

943
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:17,754
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

944
01:20:27,880 --> 01:20:29,233
You all right, Harry?

945
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,318
I just got in.

946
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:34,074
Me.

947
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,031
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

948
01:20:48,200 --> 01:20:52,193
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

949
01:20:53,680 --> 01:20:55,398
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

950
01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:58,279
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

951
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:03,877
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

952
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:10,512
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

953
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,110
Mostly, he watches me study.

954
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,871
It's a bit annoying, actually.

955
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:19,794
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

956
01:21:20,600 --> 01:21:21,999
What's that supposed to mean?

957
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,478
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

958
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,677
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

959
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,358
And...

960
01:21:33,600 --> 01:21:35,397
...I'm scared for you.

961
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,788
You got by the dragons
mostly on nerve.

962
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,789
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

963
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:43,552
Hey, Potter!

964
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:50,513
- Potter!
- Cedric.

965
01:21:53,120 --> 01:21:54,712
How...? How are you?

966
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,073
Spectacular.

967
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:02,235
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

968
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,595
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

969
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:06,433
Exactly.

970
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,869
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

971
01:22:13,640 --> 01:22:16,108
It's not a bad place for a bath.

972
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,197
Just take your egg...

973
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,559
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

974
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,390
I must be out of my mind.

975
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,230
I'm definitely out of my mind.

976
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,951
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

977
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,917
Myrtle!

978
01:23:19,080 --> 01:23:20,752
Hello, Harry.

979
01:23:21,520 --> 01:23:24,592
Long time no see.

980
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:32,195
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

981
01:23:32,360 --> 01:23:35,670
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

982
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:38,070
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

983
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:39,912
Polyjuice Potion?

984
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:44,514
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

985
01:23:51,080 --> 01:23:52,672
That's what he did.

986
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:55,072
The other boy...

987
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:58,431
...the handsome one...

988
01:23:59,680 --> 01:24:00,954
...Cedric.

989
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:06,714
Well, go on. Open it.

990
01:24:14,440 --> 01:24:19,230
<i>Come seek us
Where our voices sound</i>

991
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:23,871
<i>We cannot sing
Above the ground</i>

992
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,192
<i>An hour long you'll have to look</i>

993
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,431
<i>To recover what we took</i>

994
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,713
Myrtle...

995
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:47,350
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

996
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:49,792
Very good.

997
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:54,838
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

998
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:58,915
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

999
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:17,757
Harry, tell me again.

1000
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:22,119
"Come seek us
where our voices sound. "

1001
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:24,714
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

1002
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:28,074
"An hour long you'll have to look. "

1003
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:31,550
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

1004
01:25:32,880 --> 01:25:34,677
"Potentially problematic"?

1005
01:25:34,840 --> 01:25:37,957
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1006
01:25:38,480 --> 01:25:42,632
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1007
01:25:42,800 --> 01:25:45,189
Hate to break up the skull session.

1008
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,271
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1009
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,795
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1010
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:52,554
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1011
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:55,194
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1012
01:25:55,360 --> 01:25:57,157
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1013
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,709
Go. Now!

1014
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,998
Longbottom!

1015
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:13,071
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1016
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,516
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1017
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:26,148
<i>...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.</i>

1018
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:30,878
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1019
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:34,635
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1020
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,878
...about plants.

1021
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:38,838
Now, if there's...

1022
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:43,596
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1023
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:46,149
...then great. But otherwise...

1024
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,949
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1025
01:26:51,160 --> 01:26:53,879
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1026
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:55,439
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1027
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,999
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1028
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,230
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1029
01:26:59,400 --> 01:27:00,833
Don't be so mean.

1030
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:03,158
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1031
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,191
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1032
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,191
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1033
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,793
Most likely?

1034
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,076
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1035
01:27:13,240 --> 01:27:15,595
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1036
01:27:15,760 --> 01:27:18,354
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1037
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,357
I just wanted to help.

1038
01:27:20,520 --> 01:27:23,512
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1039
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:25,352
Where are they anyway?

1040
01:27:25,520 --> 01:27:28,432
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1041
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:37,310
<i>Welcome to the second task.</i>

1042
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:40,995
<i>Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.</i>

1043
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:42,479
<i>A treasure of sorts.</i>

1044
01:27:42,640 --> 01:27:45,154
<i>These four treasures,
one for each champion...</i>

1045
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:47,914
<i>...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.</i>

1046
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:49,593
<i>In order to win...</i>

1047
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:53,435
<i>...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.</i>

1048
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,114
<i>- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.</i>

1049
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:59,750
<i>They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.</i>

1050
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,629
<i>After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.</i>

1051
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:06,310
<i>You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.</i>

1052
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,593
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1053
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:38,678
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1054
01:28:40,520 --> 01:28:42,317
Yeah!

1055
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,998
What?

1056
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,390
<i>The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...</i>

1057
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:05,949
<i>...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...</i>

1058
01:30:06,600 --> 01:30:09,558
<i>...so she will take no further part
in this task.</i>

1059
01:31:24,160 --> 01:31:25,878
But she's my friend too!

1060
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:29,112
Only one!

1061
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:20,157
Let's get down below.

1062
01:32:29,800 --> 01:32:32,519
<i>Krum! Krum! Krum!</i>

1063
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:29,312
Yes!

1064
01:33:46,680 --> 01:33:48,671
<i>Ascendio!</i>

1065
01:33:53,680 --> 01:33:55,318
Harry!

1066
01:33:57,520 --> 01:33:58,919
He's all right.

1067
01:34:00,080 --> 01:34:01,479
He's all right. Barty!

1068
01:34:01,640 --> 01:34:04,916
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1069
01:34:05,480 --> 01:34:08,790
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1070
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:11,038
My little sister.

1071
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:12,993
Thank you.

1072
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:16,354
And you! You helped.

1073
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:19,878
Well, yeah, a bit.

1074
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:27,915
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1075
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,674
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1076
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,671
Personally, I think
you behaved admirably.

1077
01:34:33,840 --> 01:34:35,796
I finished last, Hermione.

1078
01:34:36,600 --> 01:34:40,559
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1079
01:34:40,720 --> 01:34:43,837
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1080
01:34:44,000 --> 01:34:46,753
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1081
01:34:49,000 --> 01:34:51,514
Attention!

1082
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:55,669
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1083
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:59,436
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1084
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:02,194
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1085
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:07,075
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1086
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:11,358
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1087
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:13,431
...second place...

1088
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:14,999
- Second place!
- Well done!

1089
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:17,754
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1090
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,399
Yes!

1091
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:25,478
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1092
01:35:25,640 --> 01:35:27,232
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1093
01:35:27,400 --> 01:35:29,630
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1094
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:32,394
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1095
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,112
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1096
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:35,759
Well done, boy.

1097
01:35:35,920 --> 01:35:39,037
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1098
01:35:39,200 --> 01:35:43,034
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1099
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:47,310
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1100
01:35:47,480 --> 01:35:49,357
...to lose one's family.

1101
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:53,390
Never whole again, are we?

1102
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:57,516
Still, life goes on...

1103
01:35:58,200 --> 01:35:59,792
...and here we stand.

1104
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,194
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1105
01:36:05,320 --> 01:36:06,753
Bartemius!

1106
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,879
Not trying to lure Potter into one of the
Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1107
01:36:11,040 --> 01:36:14,316
The last boy who went into the
Department of Mysteries never came out!

1108
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,877
And they say I'm mad.

1109
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:40,349
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1110
01:36:40,520 --> 01:36:43,398
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1111
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:46,388
Suppose you remind me
of meself a little.

1112
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:50,439
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1113
01:36:50,600 --> 01:36:53,797
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1114
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:55,439
And Harry, of course.

1115
01:36:55,600 --> 01:37:00,754
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1116
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:02,916
Hooray!

1117
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:06,669
<i>Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts</i>

1118
01:37:06,840 --> 01:37:09,354
<i>Teach us something, please</i>

1119
01:37:18,920 --> 01:37:20,353
Mr. Crouch?

1120
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:30,596
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1121
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:32,273
I will not.

1122
01:37:32,440 --> 01:37:36,353
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1123
01:37:36,520 --> 01:37:37,839
Then for once show them some!

1124
01:37:38,000 --> 01:37:41,879
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1125
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:45,112
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1126
01:37:45,280 --> 01:37:47,953
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1127
01:37:48,120 --> 01:37:51,635
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1128
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:57,313
Oh, Harry!

1129
01:37:57,480 --> 01:37:59,675
Harry, how good to see you again.

1130
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:01,913
I can come back later, professor.

1131
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:05,311
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1132
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:07,914
Minister, after you.

1133
01:38:08,440 --> 01:38:10,351
There you are. Your hat.

1134
01:38:10,520 --> 01:38:14,035
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1135
01:38:14,200 --> 01:38:17,237
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1136
01:39:45,000 --> 01:39:46,513
Professor?

1137
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:49,114
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1138
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:03,189
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1139
01:40:03,360 --> 01:40:05,191
...to present evidence to this council.

1140
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,954
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1141
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:12,033
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1142
01:40:12,200 --> 01:40:16,591
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1143
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,318
Do you accept these terms?

1144
01:40:18,920 --> 01:40:21,514
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1145
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:24,195
I have names, sir.

1146
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:28,190
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1147
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:33,149
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1148
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:35,356
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1149
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,074
- Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1150
01:40:38,240 --> 01:40:41,391
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1151
01:40:41,560 --> 01:40:43,835
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1152
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,115
Yeah, the same.

1153
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,829
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1154
01:40:50,000 --> 01:40:53,151
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1155
01:40:53,320 --> 01:40:55,197
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1156
01:40:55,360 --> 01:40:59,876
No! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1157
01:41:00,040 --> 01:41:02,918
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1158
01:41:03,080 --> 01:41:06,868
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1159
01:41:07,040 --> 01:41:09,918
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1160
01:41:10,080 --> 01:41:13,390
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1161
01:41:13,560 --> 01:41:15,710
Silence!

1162
01:41:16,320 --> 01:41:19,596
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1163
01:41:19,760 --> 01:41:21,796
...this session is now concluded.

1164
01:41:21,960 --> 01:41:23,916
Oh, no, no, no.

1165
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,273
I've heard about one more.

1166
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:28,874
- What's that?
- The name.

1167
01:41:29,040 --> 01:41:30,439
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1168
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:32,556
...this person took part
in the capture...

1169
01:41:32,720 --> 01:41:34,790
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1170
01:41:34,960 --> 01:41:38,316
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1171
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:40,710
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1172
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:43,314
Barty Crouch...

1173
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:46,909
...Junior.

1174
01:41:56,000 --> 01:41:57,638
Hold him down!

1175
01:42:01,120 --> 01:42:04,590
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1176
01:42:06,240 --> 01:42:07,753
Hello, Father.

1177
01:42:09,120 --> 01:42:11,076
You are no son of mine.

1178
01:42:21,960 --> 01:42:26,238
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1179
01:42:27,560 --> 01:42:28,879
It's a Pensieve.

1180
01:42:29,040 --> 01:42:33,511
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1181
01:42:33,680 --> 01:42:37,070
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1182
01:42:37,520 --> 01:42:40,353
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1183
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:42,033
...some small detail...

1184
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:45,436
...something I might have overlooked...

1185
01:42:45,600 --> 01:42:49,639
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1186
01:42:50,400 --> 01:42:54,109
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1187
01:42:55,120 --> 01:42:56,678
It's maddening.

1188
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,598
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1189
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:03,311
What exactly happened to him?

1190
01:43:03,480 --> 01:43:08,076
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1191
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:12,190
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1192
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,433
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1193
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,196
I had a dream about him.

1194
01:43:21,360 --> 01:43:24,033
It was in the summer, before school.

1195
01:43:26,120 --> 01:43:28,998
<i>In the dream, I was in a house.</i>

1196
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:33,756
<i>And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.</i>

1197
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:37,390
<i>And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.</i>

1198
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:40,479
<i>- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.</i>

1199
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:42,838
Always the same one.

1200
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,990
Sir, these dreams...

1201
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:53,154
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1202
01:43:54,680 --> 01:43:57,558
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1203
01:43:58,040 --> 01:43:59,917
I think it's best if you simply...

1204
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,038
...cast them away.

1205
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,708
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1206
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:29,229
Potter!

1207
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:31,834
What's your hurry?

1208
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,349
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1209
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:42,670
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1210
01:44:43,400 --> 01:44:44,879
Yes, sir.

1211
01:44:45,800 --> 01:44:47,119
Ingenious.

1212
01:44:48,880 --> 01:44:52,668
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1213
01:44:53,480 --> 01:44:56,836
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1214
01:44:58,440 --> 01:45:00,317
Nor is this.

1215
01:45:04,360 --> 01:45:05,952
Know what it is?

1216
01:45:07,200 --> 01:45:08,553
Bubble juice, sir?

1217
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,917
Veritaserum.

1218
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:15,189
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1219
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:20,309
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1220
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:23,872
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1221
01:45:24,040 --> 01:45:28,670
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1222
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:33,072
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1223
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:39,632
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1224
01:45:40,320 --> 01:45:43,517
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1225
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:45,796
...I'm going to find out why!

1226
01:46:11,520 --> 01:46:13,033
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1227
01:46:31,440 --> 01:46:32,919
<i>Sonorus!</i>

1228
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:42,154
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1229
01:46:42,280 --> 01:46:47,035
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1230
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:50,758
...and Mr. Potter...

1231
01:46:52,560 --> 01:46:54,232
...are tied for first position...

1232
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:58,359
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1233
01:46:59,560 --> 01:47:02,870
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1234
01:47:03,760 --> 01:47:06,672
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1235
01:47:10,840 --> 01:47:13,479
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1236
01:47:13,640 --> 01:47:16,438
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1237
01:47:16,600 --> 01:47:20,912
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1238
01:47:21,240 --> 01:47:24,994
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1239
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:32,152
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1240
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:35,551
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1241
01:47:35,720 --> 01:47:38,598
You see, people change in the maze.

1242
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,398
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1243
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:45,156
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1244
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,438
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1245
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,519
Good luck.

1246
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:01,757
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1247
01:48:04,040 --> 01:48:06,508
On the count of three. One...

1248
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:26,949
Fleur?

1249
01:51:28,560 --> 01:51:29,959
Fleur.

1250
01:51:33,360 --> 01:51:35,112
<i>Periculum!</i>

1251
01:52:12,200 --> 01:52:13,633
Get down!

1252
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,832
Get down!

1253
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:17,634
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1254
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:29,912
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1255
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,036
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1256
01:52:43,240 --> 01:52:44,832
Yes.

1257
01:53:04,840 --> 01:53:06,558
Harry!

1258
01:53:08,800 --> 01:53:10,358
Harry!

1259
01:53:12,640 --> 01:53:13,993
Harry!

1260
01:53:16,360 --> 01:53:17,873
Harry!

1261
01:53:19,800 --> 01:53:21,472
<i>Reducto!</i>

1262
01:53:37,600 --> 01:53:39,989
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1263
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:44,876
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1264
01:53:45,040 --> 01:53:46,712
For a moment, so did I.

1265
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:49,635
Some game, huh?

1266
01:53:50,600 --> 01:53:51,953
Some game.

1267
01:53:57,160 --> 01:53:58,752
Go!

1268
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:11,392
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1269
01:54:11,560 --> 01:54:13,471
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1270
01:54:13,640 --> 01:54:14,789
...three!
... three!

1271
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,553
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1272
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:37,634
Where are we?

1273
01:54:43,080 --> 01:54:44,672
I've been here before.

1274
01:54:48,160 --> 01:54:49,673
It's a Portkey.

1275
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:55,479
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1276
01:54:57,480 --> 01:55:00,711
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1277
01:55:00,880 --> 01:55:02,757
What are you talking about?

1278
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:10,598
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1279
01:55:17,920 --> 01:55:20,150
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1280
01:55:20,320 --> 01:55:22,959
<i>- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!</i>

1281
01:55:33,800 --> 01:55:35,597
Do it! Now!

1282
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:49,469
Bone of the father...

1283
01:55:49,640 --> 01:55:52,438
...unwillingly given.

1284
01:55:59,000 --> 01:56:01,912
Flesh of the servant...

1285
01:56:03,880 --> 01:56:06,917
...willingly sacrificed.

1286
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:14,435
And blood of the enemy...

1287
01:56:20,000 --> 01:56:22,389
...forcibly taken.

1288
01:56:28,200 --> 01:56:31,033
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1289
01:56:31,760 --> 01:56:33,637
...again.

1290
01:57:34,440 --> 01:57:37,671
My wand, Wormtail.

1291
01:57:46,840 --> 01:57:48,717
Hold out your arm.

1292
01:57:48,880 --> 01:57:50,438
Master.

1293
01:57:50,600 --> 01:57:53,114
Thank you, master.

1294
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,679
The other arm, Wormtail.

1295
01:58:33,640 --> 01:58:35,471
Welcome, my friends.

1296
01:58:36,840 --> 01:58:39,479
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1297
01:58:40,080 --> 01:58:45,359
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1298
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:49,078
I confess myself...

1299
01:58:49,520 --> 01:58:51,033
...disappointed.

1300
01:58:51,680 --> 01:58:53,671
Not one of you tried to find me.

1301
01:58:53,840 --> 01:58:57,071
Crabbe! Macnair!

1302
01:58:57,960 --> 01:58:59,234
Goyle!

1303
01:59:01,640 --> 01:59:03,198
Not even you...

1304
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:08,751
...Lucius.

1305
01:59:10,520 --> 01:59:15,150
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1306
01:59:15,320 --> 01:59:18,198
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1307
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:23,309
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1308
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:30,353
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1309
01:59:32,280 --> 01:59:34,794
...that is my true mask.

1310
01:59:35,160 --> 01:59:36,673
I returned.

1311
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:42,749
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1312
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:49,398
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1313
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,630
Thank you, master.

1314
01:59:57,200 --> 01:59:58,872
Thank you.

1315
02:00:01,840 --> 02:00:04,115
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1316
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:06,953
Harry.

1317
02:00:07,120 --> 02:00:09,793
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1318
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:14,192
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1319
02:00:14,360 --> 02:00:15,679
I'd introduce you...

1320
02:00:15,840 --> 02:00:19,958
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1321
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:25,114
The boy who lived.

1322
02:00:25,240 --> 02:00:28,038
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1323
02:00:28,200 --> 02:00:32,034
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1324
02:00:32,200 --> 02:00:36,716
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1325
02:00:36,880 --> 02:00:38,313
Yes, shall I?

1326
02:00:38,760 --> 02:00:40,034
It was love.

1327
02:00:40,200 --> 02:00:44,512
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1328
02:00:44,680 --> 02:00:47,148
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1329
02:00:47,560 --> 02:00:49,278
I could not touch him.

1330
02:00:50,440 --> 02:00:52,510
It was old magic.

1331
02:00:52,680 --> 02:00:54,830
Something I should have foreseen.

1332
02:00:55,000 --> 02:00:56,718
But no matter, no matter.

1333
02:00:56,880 --> 02:00:58,996
Things have changed.

1334
02:00:59,720 --> 02:01:03,076
I can touch you...

1335
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:05,318
...now.

1336
02:01:13,160 --> 02:01:14,434
Yeah.

1337
02:01:20,520 --> 02:01:24,035
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1338
02:01:25,200 --> 02:01:26,792
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1339
02:01:28,360 --> 02:01:30,476
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1340
02:01:32,040 --> 02:01:34,235
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1341
02:01:34,400 --> 02:01:36,709
First, we bow to each other.

1342
02:01:36,880 --> 02:01:39,189
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1343
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:42,432
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1344
02:01:42,600 --> 02:01:43,874
I said, bow.

1345
02:01:45,640 --> 02:01:49,792
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1346
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:51,997
<i>Crucio!</i>

1347
02:01:54,360 --> 02:01:56,032
<i>Crucio!</i>

1348
02:01:57,040 --> 02:01:58,917
Attaboy, Harry.

1349
02:01:59,080 --> 02:02:01,116
Your parents would be proud.

1350
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:04,676
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1351
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:06,353
<i>Expelliar...</i>

1352
02:02:09,240 --> 02:02:11,549
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1353
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:13,631
I'm going to destroy you.

1354
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:21,078
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1355
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,148
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1356
02:02:24,320 --> 02:02:26,914
...they'll speak only of how you...

1357
02:02:27,160 --> 02:02:28,912
...begged for death.

1358
02:02:29,080 --> 02:02:32,675
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1359
02:02:33,200 --> 02:02:34,758
...obliged.

1360
02:02:35,080 --> 02:02:36,513
Get up!

1361
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:43,197
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1362
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:45,510
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1363
02:02:45,680 --> 02:02:48,752
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1364
02:03:02,120 --> 02:03:03,792
Have it your way.

1365
02:03:04,800 --> 02:03:07,075
<i>- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!</i>

1366
02:03:23,880 --> 02:03:26,474
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1367
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:32,478
He's mine!

1368
02:04:04,200 --> 02:04:08,034
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1369
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:10,156
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1370
02:04:10,320 --> 02:04:12,038
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1371
02:04:13,160 --> 02:04:16,072
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1372
02:04:16,240 --> 02:04:18,674
Take my body back to my father.

1373
02:04:19,680 --> 02:04:20,954
Let go.

1374
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:23,277
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1375
02:04:24,080 --> 02:04:26,594
Let go! Let go!

1376
02:04:32,120 --> 02:04:33,439
<i>Accio!</i>

1377
02:04:38,920 --> 02:04:40,831
No!

1378
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:54,598
He did it!

1379
02:04:55,760 --> 02:04:57,352
Harry!

1380
02:05:00,040 --> 02:05:01,473
Harry!

1381
02:05:02,600 --> 02:05:05,717
No! No! No, don't!

1382
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,797
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1383
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:10,548
He's back. He's back.

1384
02:05:10,720 --> 02:05:12,676
Voldemort's back.

1385
02:05:12,840 --> 02:05:15,115
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1386
02:05:15,280 --> 02:05:17,510
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1387
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:20,353
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1388
02:05:20,520 --> 02:05:22,750
He's home. You both are.

1389
02:05:22,920 --> 02:05:26,390
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1390
02:05:29,320 --> 02:05:32,790
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1391
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:34,758
Let me through.

1392
02:05:34,920 --> 02:05:36,353
Let me through!

1393
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:39,394
Let me through!

1394
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:40,913
That's my son!

1395
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,559
That's my boy!

1396
02:05:46,280 --> 02:05:48,874
It's my boy!

1397
02:05:51,560 --> 02:05:54,996
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1398
02:05:55,160 --> 02:05:57,993
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1399
02:05:58,640 --> 02:06:00,756
No!

1400
02:06:03,720 --> 02:06:05,995
It's all right, I got you.

1401
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:09,357
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1402
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:14,918
No!

1403
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,797
No!

1404
02:06:58,440 --> 02:07:00,078
Are you all right, Potter?

1405
02:07:00,640 --> 02:07:02,471
Does it hurt? That?

1406
02:07:02,640 --> 02:07:04,358
Not so much now.

1407
02:07:05,280 --> 02:07:07,271
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1408
02:07:10,280 --> 02:07:12,191
The cup was a Portkey.

1409
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:16,552
Someone had bewitched it.

1410
02:07:16,840 --> 02:07:18,831
What was it like?

1411
02:07:19,160 --> 02:07:20,752
- What was he like?
- Who?

1412
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:22,592
The Dark Lord.

1413
02:07:24,840 --> 02:07:27,798
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1414
02:07:29,000 --> 02:07:30,752
I don't know.

1415
02:07:33,480 --> 02:07:36,278
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1416
02:07:39,120 --> 02:07:41,031
...into one of my nightmares.

1417
02:07:59,000 --> 02:08:00,513
Were there others?

1418
02:08:00,680 --> 02:08:02,830
In the graveyard, were there others?

1419
02:08:06,600 --> 02:08:07,953
I...

1420
02:08:08,640 --> 02:08:12,394
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1421
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:22,677
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1422
02:08:26,920 --> 02:08:29,832
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1423
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:31,831
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1424
02:08:35,240 --> 02:08:38,755
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1425
02:08:38,920 --> 02:08:41,309
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1426
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:45,474
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1427
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:48,672
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1428
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:50,319
...that led him straight to it?

1429
02:08:58,400 --> 02:09:02,234
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1430
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:06,275
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But... "

1431
02:09:06,440 --> 02:09:08,510
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1432
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:12,476
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1433
02:09:12,640 --> 02:09:13,868
And now the deed is done.

1434
02:09:15,480 --> 02:09:19,632
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1435
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:31,156
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1436
02:09:32,040 --> 02:09:34,429
...that I have once and for all...

1437
02:09:35,040 --> 02:09:39,192
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1438
02:09:39,360 --> 02:09:40,554
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1439
02:09:45,080 --> 02:09:46,274
Severus.

1440
02:09:48,680 --> 02:09:50,113
That's it, take it.

1441
02:09:52,000 --> 02:09:55,310
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1442
02:09:55,480 --> 02:09:58,074
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1443
02:09:58,240 --> 02:10:01,198
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1444
02:10:04,120 --> 02:10:05,599
Harry, away from there!

1445
02:10:25,720 --> 02:10:28,917
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1446
02:10:29,840 --> 02:10:31,831
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1447
02:10:33,560 --> 02:10:34,595
Polyjuice Potion.

1448
02:10:34,760 --> 02:10:37,877
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1449
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:39,951
We'll get you up in a minute.

1450
02:11:13,000 --> 02:11:14,319
Harry!

1451
02:11:17,840 --> 02:11:19,956
Barty Crouch Junior.

1452
02:11:20,200 --> 02:11:22,998
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1453
02:11:25,280 --> 02:11:26,429
Your arm, Harry.

1454
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:32,750
You know what this means, don't you?

1455
02:11:33,640 --> 02:11:34,914
He's back.

1456
02:11:36,040 --> 02:11:38,110
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1457
02:11:39,000 --> 02:11:41,230
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1458
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:45,797
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1459
02:11:46,240 --> 02:11:48,629
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1460
02:11:49,160 --> 02:11:51,913
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1461
02:12:11,000 --> 02:12:13,594
Today, we acknowledge...

1462
02:12:14,240 --> 02:12:16,879
...a really terrible loss.

1463
02:12:18,920 --> 02:12:21,559
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1464
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:23,950
...exceptionally hard-working...

1465
02:12:24,880 --> 02:12:27,075
...infinitely fair-minded...

1466
02:12:27,640 --> 02:12:29,835
...and, most importantly...

1467
02:12:30,120 --> 02:12:34,511
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1468
02:12:35,600 --> 02:12:39,798
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1469
02:12:42,720 --> 02:12:44,199
You see...

1470
02:12:45,000 --> 02:12:46,991
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1471
02:12:47,880 --> 02:12:49,791
...by Lord Voldemort!

1472
02:12:51,600 --> 02:12:55,036
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1473
02:12:55,640 --> 02:12:59,189
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1474
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:02,872
Now, the pain...

1475
02:13:03,040 --> 02:13:06,555
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1476
02:13:06,720 --> 02:13:07,994
...and reminds us...

1477
02:13:08,160 --> 02:13:11,709
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1478
02:13:11,880 --> 02:13:15,156
...our hearts beat as one.

1479
02:13:15,640 --> 02:13:17,596
In light of recent events...

1480
02:13:17,920 --> 02:13:22,630
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1481
02:13:23,480 --> 02:13:28,634
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1482
02:13:29,000 --> 02:13:31,070
You remember that...

1483
02:13:31,640 --> 02:13:34,552
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1484
02:13:35,080 --> 02:13:37,435
...kind and honest...

1485
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:42,311
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1486
02:14:06,520 --> 02:14:08,476
I never liked these curtains.

1487
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:11,634
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1488
02:14:11,920 --> 02:14:13,672
By accident, of course.

1489
02:14:19,120 --> 02:14:23,318
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1490
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,192
Professor...

1491
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,278
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1492
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:36,272
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1493
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:40,030
<i>Priori Incantatem.</i>

1494
02:14:44,000 --> 02:14:46,594
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1495
02:14:47,160 --> 02:14:48,912
They reappeared.

1496
02:14:50,320 --> 02:14:53,949
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1497
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:58,914
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1498
02:14:59,360 --> 02:15:03,990
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1499
02:15:07,240 --> 02:15:08,832
But remember this:

1500
02:15:09,000 --> 02:15:10,831
You have friends here.

1501
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:14,432
You're not alone.

1502
02:15:34,280 --> 02:15:35,952
Hermione.

1503
02:15:36,360 --> 02:15:38,271
This is for you.

1504
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:40,956
Write to me. Promise.

1505
02:15:42,000 --> 02:15:43,353
Bye.

1506
02:15:49,320 --> 02:15:51,197
<i>Au revoir, Ron.</i>

1507
02:16:33,320 --> 02:16:35,754
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1508
02:16:35,920 --> 02:16:36,989
- No.
- No.

1509
02:16:37,160 --> 02:16:41,358
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1510
02:16:45,600 --> 02:16:48,319
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1511
02:16:55,320 --> 02:16:56,719
Yes.

1512
02:17:01,280 --> 02:17:04,431
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1513
02:17:04,600 --> 02:17:07,068
I won't. You know I won't.

1514
02:17:08,280 --> 02:17:11,875
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
