00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,900
Bloody kids.

3
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,000
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

4
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,600
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

5
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,000
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

6
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,600
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

7
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,000
I only meant...

8
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,200
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

9
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,800
No! The boy is everything!

10
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:03,400
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

11
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,300
Exactly as I said.

12
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,400
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

13
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,600
First, gather our old comrades.

14
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,000
Send them a sign.

15
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:31,200
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

16
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:35,100
...is standing just outside the door.

17
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:40,600
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

18
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,600
Avada Kedavra!

19
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,100
Harry.

20
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,500
Harry!

21
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Are you all right?

22
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,400
Hermione. Bad dream.

23
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:01,000
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

24
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,400
Last night.

25
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

26
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,200
Bloody hell.

27
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,900
Honestly, get dressed.

28
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,400
And don't go back to sleep.

29
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,900
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

30
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,400
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

31
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,100
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

32
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,800
Keep up!

33
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,200
Arthur!

34
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
It's about time, son.

35
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,000
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

36
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:45,800
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

37
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,500
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

38
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,800
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,700
This way.

40
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,800
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

41
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,700
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

42
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,900
Yes, it's just over there.

44
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,000
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

45
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,400
We don't want to be late.

46
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,700
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

47
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,000
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

48
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,700
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

49
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,200
Time to go!

50
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
What's a Portkey?

51
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:30,200
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,500
...three!

53
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,600
Let go, kids!

54
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,400
- What?!
- Let go!

55
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

56
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,600
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

57
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,500
Go on, look at that!

58
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:17,300
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

59
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,900
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

60
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,700
Look!

61
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,900
Come on! Keep up, girls!

62
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
Blimey!

63
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,200
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

64
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,800
- See you at the match.
- See you.

65
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,300
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

66
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,100
See you later, Cedric.

67
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Home sweet home.

68
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,200
What?

69
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,500
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

70
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:05,000
- All to the bath.
- Look.

71
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,600
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

72
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,700
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

73
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,300
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,700
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,200
I love magic.

76
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,900
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

77
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:41,300
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

78
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,900
Well, put it this way:

79
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,900
If it rains...

80
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:47,400
...you'll be the first to know.

81
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,600
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

82
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:54,000
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

83
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,400
Don't boast, Draco.

84
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
There's no need with these people.

85
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,600
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

86
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,900
While you can.

87
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,900
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

88
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,000
Come on!

89
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,200
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

90
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

91
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,800
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

92
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,200
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

93
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,600
Who's that?

94
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,400
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

95
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:05,000
Krum! Krum! Krum!

96
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,000
Krum!

97
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,900
Yes!

98
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,500
Good evening!

99
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,100
As Minister for Magic...

100
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:29,300
...it gives me great pleasure...

101
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,700
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

102
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,800
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

103
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,800
Let the match...

104
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,700
...begin!

105
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,000
Krum! Krum! Krum!

106
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,500
There's no one like Krum.

107
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,300
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

108
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,500
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

109
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,600
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

110
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,200
He's an artist.

111
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,600
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

112
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,200
Viktor, I love you

113
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,900
Viktor, I do

114
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,400
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

115
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,200
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

116
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,100
Stop! Stop it!

117
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,200
It's not the Irish.

118
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,500
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

119
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,000
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

120
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,500
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

121
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,400
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

122
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,700
Go!

123
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,700
Harry!

124
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,700
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

125
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,100
Harry! Harry!

126
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,200
Morsmordre!

127
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,500
Harry!

128
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,200
- Where are you?
- Harry!

129
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,100
We've been looking for you for ages!

130
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,000
Thought we lost you, mate.

131
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,800
What is that?

132
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,000
Stupefy!

133
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,500
Stop!

134
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,900
That's my son!

135
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,600
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

136
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,000
Which of you conjured it?

137
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,400
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

138
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

139
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

140
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,400
What crime?

141
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,100
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

142
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,400
What, Voldemort?

143
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,500
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

144
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,900
- His followers?
- Yeah.

145
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,900
Death Eaters.

146
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,700
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

147
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,500
There!

148
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,000
All of you, this way!

149
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,200
A man, Harry?

150
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,900
Who?

151
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,100
I don't know.

152
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
I didn't see his face.

153
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,200
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,500
Anything from the trolley?

155
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,100
Anything from the trolley, dears?

156
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,500
Packet of Drooble's...

157
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,500
...and a Licorice Wand.

158
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

159
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

160
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,900
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

161
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,900
Thank you.

162
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,700
Anything sweet for you, dear?

163
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,900
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

164
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Anything from the trolley?

165
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
This is horrible.

166
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,100
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

167
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,000
Wasn't there any security or...?

168
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,000
Loads, according to Dad.

169
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,200
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

170
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,200
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

171
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm fine.

172
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,000
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

173
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:05,100
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

174
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,800
Hedwig. There we go.

175
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,200
Clear the runway!

176
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,400
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

177
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,300
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

178
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,700
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

179
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,000
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

180
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,000
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

181
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
Yes, what is it?

182
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,000
What is it?

183
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,700
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

184
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:01,900
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

185
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,100
The Triwizard Tournament.

186
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,700
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

187
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,000
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

188
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,300
...for a series of magical contests.

189
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,000
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

190
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,900
Now let me be clear.

191
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,000
If chosen, you stand alone.

192
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,100
And trust me when I say...

193
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:26,300
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

194
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:30,900
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

195
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:35,100
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

196
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:39,300
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

197
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,400
Bloody hell.

198
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,600
Blimey. That's one big woman.

199
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
And now our friends from the north.

200
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,600
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

201
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,700
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

202
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,300
Oh, it's Krum!

203
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,900
Blimey, it's him!

204
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,900
Viktor Krum!

205
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,300
Albus.

206
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,200
Igor.

207
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,500
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

208
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,200
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

209
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:37,900
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

210
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,300
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

211
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,200
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

212
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,100
You idiot!

213
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,100
Your attention, please!

214
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,600
I'd like to say a few words.

215
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,400
Eternal glory.

216
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,900
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

217
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,200
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

218
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

219
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

220
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:25,200
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

221
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,800
To explain all this...

222
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,600
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

223
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,900
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

224
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,100
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

225
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,000
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

226
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,700
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

227
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,500
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

228
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,000
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

229
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,300
Thank you.

230
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,700
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

231
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,100
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

232
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,000
After due consideration...

233
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,100
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

234
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,200
...no student under the age of 17...

235
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,100
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

236
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:52,000
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

237
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,700
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

238
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,700
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

239
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,500
The Goblet of Fire.

240
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,900
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

241
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,000
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

242
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,300
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

243
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,600
Do not do so lightly.

244
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,600
If chosen, there's no turning back.

245
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:42,700
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

246
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Alastor Moody.

247
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,500
Ex-Auror...

248
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,600
...Ministry malcontent...

249
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,200
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

250
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,900
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

251
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,800
Any questions?

252
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,700
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

253
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,700
...I believe in a practical approach.

254
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,600
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

255
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,500
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

256
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,900
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

257
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,200
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

258
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:56,100
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

259
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,700
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

260
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,100
You need to be prepared.

261
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,700
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

262
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,200
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

263
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,300
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

264
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,800
And hear across classrooms!

265
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,700
So which curse shall we see first?

266
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,100
- Weasley!
- Yes?

267
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
Stand.

268
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,500
Give us a curse.

269
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,500
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

270
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,400
The lmperius Curse.

271
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,800
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

272
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,900
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

273
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,900
Perhaps this will show you why.

274
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,800
Hello.

275
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,200
Lovely little beauty.

276
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:59,300
Engorgio.

277
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,300
Imperio!

278
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,200
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

279
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,000
If she bites...

280
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,000
...she's lethal.

281
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,400
What are you laughing at?

282
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,200
Get off!

283
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,400
Talented, isn't she?

284
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,900
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

285
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,300
Drown herself?

286
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,400
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

287
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:55,500
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

288
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,900
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

289
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,000
But here's the rub:

290
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,400
How do we sort out the liars?

291
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,400
Another, another.

292
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
Up, up. Come on.

293
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,700
Longbottom, is it?

294
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,800
Up.

295
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,800
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

296
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,300
There's the...

297
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,500
The Cruciatus Curse.

298
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,500
Correct, correct. Come, come.

299
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,300
Particularly nasty.

300
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,200
The torture curse.

301
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,400
Crucio!

302
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,900
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

303
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:16,500
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

304
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,300
No?

305
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,600
Avada Kedavra!

306
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,900
The Killing Curse.

307
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,200
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

308
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,100
...and he's sitting in this room.

309
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,500
Brilliant, isn't he?

310
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:13,700
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

311
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:17,000
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

312
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,800
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

313
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,100
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

314
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,500
Neville?

315
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,100
Son?

316
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,100
You all right?

317
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,400
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

318
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
We're gonna be late!

319
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,900
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

320
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,000
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

321
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,800
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

322
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
Yeah, rather you than me.

323
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,700
Yes!

324
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,800
Thank you, thank you.

325
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,000
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

326
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,400
It's not going to work.

327
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,100
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

328
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,200
You see this? This is an Age Line.

329
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,200
Dumbledore drew it himself.

330
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,800
So?

331
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,000
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

332
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

333
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,600
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

334
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:10,300
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

335
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,300
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

336
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,700
- Yes!
- Yes!

337
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,000
Yeah!

338
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,800
Yes!

339
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,800
Ready?

340
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:30,200
- Yes!
- Yes!

341
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
- You said!
- You said!

342
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,100
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

343
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:47,800
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

344
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,400
Fight! Fight! Fight!

345
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,200
We're "old school," right?

346
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,800
Yeah, but you look older!

347
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,800
Sit down. Please.

348
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:39,100
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

349
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,400
The champion selection.

350
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,600
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

351
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,000
The champion for Beauxbatons...

352
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,200
...is Fleur Delacour.

353
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,700
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

354
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:05,200
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

355
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:09,600
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

356
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,100
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

357
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,400
...this vessel of victory...

358
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,800
...the Triwizard Cup!

359
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,200
Harry Potter.

360
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,900
Harry Potter?

361
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,500
No. No.

362
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,300
Harry Potter!

363
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,200
Go on, Harry.

364
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,200
Harry, for goodness sake.

365
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,900
He's a cheat!

366
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,000
He's not even 17 yet!

367
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:14,300
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

368
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,500
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

369
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:19,600
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

370
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,000
- Harry.
- I protest!

371
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,100
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

372
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,400
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

373
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,900
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

374
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:30,000
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

375
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,600
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

376
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,200
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

377
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,500
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

378
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,700
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

379
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

380
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,200
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

381
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,400
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

382
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,500
Leave this to you, Barty.

383
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,100
The rules are absolute.

384
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,000
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

385
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,800
Mr. Potter has no choice.

386
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,900
He is, as of tonight...

387
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,700
...a Triwizard champion.

388
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,800
This can't go on, Albus.

389
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,000
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

390
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,100
What do you suggest, Minerva?

391
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,400
Put an end to it.

392
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,800
Don't let Potter compete.

393
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,500
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

394
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:00,500
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

395
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:03,100
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

396
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,300
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

397
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,400
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

398
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,100
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

399
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,300
...let them unfold.

400
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,600
What...? Do nothing?

401
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
Offer him up as bait?

402
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,300
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

403
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,900
I agree. With Severus.

404
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,300
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

405
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:36,100
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

406
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,400
He must be anxious enough as it is...

407
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,600
...knowing what lies ahead.

408
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,600
Then again, we all are.

409
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,300
How did you do it?

410
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:08,400
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

411
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,800
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

412
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,400
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

413
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,500
Okay?

414
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,100
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

415
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:22,800
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

416
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
I didn't put my name in that cup.

417
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,800
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

418
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,000
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

419
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,400
It just did.

420
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,900
Okay?

421
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,400
Piss off.

422
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,900
What a charismatic quartet.

423
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,900
Hello.

424
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,300
I'm Rita Skeeter.

425
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,400
I write for the Daily Prophet.

426
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,700
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

427
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,000
You're the juicy news.

428
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,400
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

429
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,100
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

430
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,500
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

431
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:42,700
In short, what makes a champion tick?

432
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,500
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

433
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,200
So who's feeling up to sharing?

434
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,100
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

435
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,100
This is cozy.

436
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,400
It's a broom cupboard.

437
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,100
You should feel right at home, then.

438
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,100
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

439
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,800
No.

440
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,200
So tell me, Harry.

441
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,200
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

442
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,900
I'm 14. Sorry.

443
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:30,000
- About to compete
against three students...

444
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,500
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

445
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,200
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

446
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,700
...in your dizziest daydreams.

447
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,300
Concerned?

448
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,300
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

449
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,300
Just ignore the quill.

450
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,300
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

451
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,100
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

452
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,000
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

453
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,400
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

454
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,400
No, I didn't enter.

455
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,100
Of course you didn't.

456
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,000
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

457
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,900
Scratch that last.

458
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,800
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

459
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
Proud? Or concerned...

460
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,800
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

461
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,500
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

462
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:30,600
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

463
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,300
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

464
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,700
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

465
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,100
...and she's too easily recognized.

466
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,100
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

467
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:18,500
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

468
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,400
And make sure you're alone.

469
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,100
Sirius.

470
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,700
P. S:

471
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,700
The bird bites.

472
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,500
Sirius?

473
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,300
Harry Potter, age 12...

474
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,400
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

475
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,200
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

476
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,900
...and choking back tears...

477
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,000
Sirius. How...?

478
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,700
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

479
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,800
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

480
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,400
No!

481
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,300
I had to ask.

482
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:36,300
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

483
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,900
But who was the third man in the room?

484
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,500
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

485
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,900
No.

486
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,500
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

487
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,000
And what was that?

488
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,800
He wanted...

489
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,600
...me.

490
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:00,500
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

491
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,000
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

492
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,000
Yes.

493
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,700
It's just a dream.

494
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:09,900
Look, Harry.

495
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,500
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

496
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:17,700
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

497
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:19,000
What are you saying?

498
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,400
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

499
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,000
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

500
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,500
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

501
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,400
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

502
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,900
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

503
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:47,000
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

504
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,700
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

505
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,700
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

506
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,300
Who were you talking to?

507
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,500
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

508
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:08,800
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

509
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,700
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

510
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,200
Amazing.

511
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,900
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

512
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,900
Right, sorry.

513
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,700
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

514
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:55,100
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

515
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,300
It's already been through enough people.

516
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,600
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

517
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:04,400
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

518
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,700
What do you want me to say again?

519
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,200
Go.

520
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:15,300
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

521
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,400
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

522
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,100
Is that right? Well, you...

523
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:23,300
What?

524
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,300
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

525
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:37,100
Dean was told by Parvati that...

526
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,600
Please don't ask me to say it again.

527
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,400
Hagrid's looking for you.

528
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:46,000
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

529
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,800
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

530
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,600
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

531
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:03,100
You'll see soon enough.

532
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,500
Now pay attention, this is important.

533
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,700
What's with the flower?

534
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,100
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

535
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,300
As a matter of fact, I have.

536
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,600
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

537
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,600
Hagrid?

538
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,400
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

539
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:43,400
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

540
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:47,300
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

541
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:50,100
...you had forgotten me.

542
00:47:50,300 --> 00:47:52,200
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

543
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:54,700
What is it you wanted to show me?

544
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,600
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

545
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
...exhilarated.

546
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,900
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

547
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,200
Can we get closer?

548
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,500
Dragons?

549
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,100
That's the first task?

550
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,600
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

551
00:48:31,900 --> 00:48:34,900
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

552
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,500
Oh, crikey!

553
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:43,000
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

554
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,100
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

555
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,600
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

556
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:53,300
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

557
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,900
Didn't Ron tell you that?

558
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,300
No, he didn't.

559
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,900
He didn't tell me a thing.

560
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,900
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

561
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,100
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

562
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:20,900
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

563
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,700
Like the badge?

564
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,000
Excuse me.

565
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,600
Harry.

566
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:34,100
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

567
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,800
Can I have a word?

568
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,600
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

569
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,800
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

570
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:46,900
Dragons. That's the first task.

571
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,200
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

572
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,400
Are you serious?

573
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,200
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

574
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,600
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

575
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,300
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

576
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,900
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

577
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:06,100
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

578
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:08,700
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

579
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:10,900
It just happens a fair bit.

580
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:14,100
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

581
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:16,200
You're a right foul git, you know that?

582
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,600
- You think so?
- I know so.

583
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:20,100
Anything else?

584
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,800
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

585
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,700
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

586
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,900
My father and I have a bet, you see.

587
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,300
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

588
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,800
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

589
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:45,100
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

590
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:50,000
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

591
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,600
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

592
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:58,600
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

593
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,600
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

594
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:04,500
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

595
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:07,600
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

596
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:12,800
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

597
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:20,400
Stand still! Stand still!

598
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,500
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

599
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:35,600
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

600
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,700
Professor!

601
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:41,400
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

602
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:44,300
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

603
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,200
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

604
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:50,600
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

605
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:55,600
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

606
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,200
Away!

607
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:03,500
You. Come with me.

608
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,800
That's a Foe-Glass.

609
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:43,700
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

610
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:48,500
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

611
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:55,100
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

612
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,300
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

613
00:52:57,600 --> 00:52:59,300
Now...

614
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,800
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

615
00:53:07,700 --> 00:53:10,000
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

616
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,000
Sit.

617
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:18,100
Listen to me, Potter.

618
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,300
Your pal Diggory?

619
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,900
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

620
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,300
Miss Delacour?

621
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,400
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

622
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,500
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

623
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,800
...but Karkaroff's is not.

624
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:38,900
They'll have a strategy.

625
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,600
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

626
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,900
Come on, Potter.

627
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,200
What are your strengths?

628
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,100
I don't know.

629
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:57,100
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

630
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:01,300
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

631
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:05,100
You're allowed a wand.

632
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,000
Bets! Place your bets!

633
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:15,300
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

634
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,400
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

635
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,500
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

636
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,100
Yes, sir?

637
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,200
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

638
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,600
Your attention, please.

639
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:31,500
This is a great day for all of us.

640
00:54:34,900 --> 00:54:39,100
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

641
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:42,000
Please keep your seats at all times.

642
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:44,900
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

643
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,500
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

644
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,400
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

645
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:53,600
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

646
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:59,300
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

647
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,300
Battle a dragon.

648
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,100
Young love.

649
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:10,100
How...

650
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,900
...stirring.

651
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:19,700
If everything goes unfortunately today...

652
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:22,700
...you two may even
make the front page.

653
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:25,100
You have no business here.

654
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,300
This tent is for champions...

655
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,300
...and friends.

656
00:55:32,100 --> 00:55:36,300
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

657
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,200
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

658
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:46,600
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

659
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:50,000
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

660
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,300
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

661
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,300
Sorry, I'll just go.

662
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,000
Barty, the bag.

663
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,600
Champions, in a circle around me.

664
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,900
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

665
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:07,000
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

666
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:09,600
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

667
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:15,300
The Welsh Green.

668
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,300
Mr. Krum.

669
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:26,200
The Chinese Fireball.

670
00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:35,100
The Swedish Short-Snout.

671
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,500
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

672
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:40,000
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

673
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,800
The Hungarian Horntail.

674
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:51,100
These represent four
very real dragons...

675
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,300
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

676
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:57,000
Your objective is simple:

677
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,600
Collect the egg.

678
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:01,800
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

679
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,500
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

680
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:07,000
Any questions?

681
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:10,700
Very well. Good luck, champions.

682
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:13,700
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

683
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:26,100
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

684
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:41,100
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

685
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:44,700
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

686
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:48,400
And now our fourth and final contestant.

687
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,900
Harry! Harry! Harry!

688
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,000
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

689
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,500
Accio Firebolt!

690
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,700
- Yeah!
- Yes!

691
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:48,000
Oh, my God.

692
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:01,000
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

693
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,100
Yes! Yes!

694
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,000
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

695
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,200
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

696
01:03:03,300 --> 01:03:05,100
- Never!
- Never!

697
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,500
Shush!

698
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,700
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

699
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:15,500
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

700
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:18,900
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

701
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:32,400
What the bloody hell was that?

702
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:39,300
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

703
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:43,500
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

704
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:50,700
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

705
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,800
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

706
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:57,000
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

707
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,400
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

708
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,900
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

709
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:09,200
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

710
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,900
No, no, no, I did.

711
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,000
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

712
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:18,300
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

713
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,400
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

714
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:26,400
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

715
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,600
...after you'd figured that out.

716
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:31,700
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

717
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:33,800
That's completely mental.

718
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:37,000
Yeah. Isn't it?

719
01:04:37,100 --> 01:04:39,200
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

720
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,500
Boys.

721
01:05:07,900 --> 01:05:09,400
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

722
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:15,600
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

723
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:21,300
Shush.

724
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,300
Look at this!

725
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:27,800
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

726
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,100
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

727
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,000
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

728
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,500
Her latest prey, sources report...

729
01:05:36,600 --> 01:05:40,300
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

730
01:05:40,600 --> 01:05:44,500
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

731
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:47,800
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

732
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,500
Thank you, Nigel.

733
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:57,100
Not now, Nigel. Later.

734
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:00,500
Go on.

735
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:08,600
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

736
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,600
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

737
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,500
Mum sent me a dress.

738
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:26,500
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

739
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:28,800
Nose down, Harry.

740
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:33,300
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

741
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:36,900
What are you on about?

742
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,000
They're not for Ginny.

743
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,600
They're for you.

744
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:45,300
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

745
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,700
The Yule Ball...

746
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:54,200
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

747
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,000
...since its inception.

748
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:01,600
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

749
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,400
...gather in the Great Hall...

750
01:07:03,600 --> 01:07:07,600
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

751
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:11,400
As representatives of the host school...

752
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:16,700
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

753
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:19,600
And I mean this literally, because...

754
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:24,200
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

755
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:26,600
...a dance.

756
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,700
Silence!

757
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:35,800
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

758
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:38,700
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

759
01:07:38,800 --> 01:07:42,900
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

760
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:47,300
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

761
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,000
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

762
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:51,600
Now, to dance...

763
01:07:51,800 --> 01:07:55,500
...is to let the body breathe.

764
01:07:55,700 --> 01:07:59,000
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

765
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,500
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

766
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:05,700
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

767
01:08:05,900 --> 01:08:09,000
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

768
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:11,400
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

769
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:14,000
Will you join me, please?

770
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:22,200
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

771
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,900
- Where?
- My waist.

772
01:08:25,100 --> 01:08:27,600
And extend your arm.

773
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:30,000
Mr. Filch, if you please.

774
01:08:33,100 --> 01:08:35,100
One, two, three.

775
01:08:35,300 --> 01:08:38,800
One, two, three. One, two, three.

776
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:44,600
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

777
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:46,000
- Never.
- Never.

778
01:08:46,100 --> 01:08:50,000
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

779
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,000
Why do they have to travel in packs?

780
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:17,900
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

781
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:29,200
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

782
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:31,600
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

783
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,400
I take after my mum.

784
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,500
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

785
01:09:43,700 --> 01:09:45,600
No, not the maternal sort, her.

786
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:49,400
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

787
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:54,100
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

788
01:09:54,200 --> 01:09:56,600
He laughed so hard at that.

789
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:00,500
Very funny.

790
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:10,200
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

791
01:10:10,300 --> 01:10:13,400
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

792
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,000
But enough of me. What about you?

793
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,300
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

794
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:43,300
Well, us and Neville.

795
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,200
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

796
01:10:46,900 --> 01:10:50,300
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

797
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,500
Now I'm really depressed.

798
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,800
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

799
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,800
Who you going with, then?

800
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,200
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

801
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:17,700
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

802
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,800
To the ball?

803
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,400
Yeah, all right.

804
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:26,700
Oi, Hermione.

805
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:28,500
You're a girl.

806
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:30,000
Very well spotted.

807
01:11:30,200 --> 01:11:32,100
Come with one of us?

808
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:39,600
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

809
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:41,300
For a girl, it's just sad.

810
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:45,200
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

811
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:54,200
And I said yes!

812
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:57,600
Bloody hell.

813
01:11:57,800 --> 01:11:59,400
She's lying, right?

814
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:00,900
If you say so.

815
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:04,900
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

816
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:08,900
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

817
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,700
Agreed.

818
01:12:35,000 --> 01:12:36,400
- Cho!
- Harry!

819
01:12:39,900 --> 01:12:42,700
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

820
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:44,400
Okay, thanks.

821
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:49,900
Cho?

822
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:52,400
Yes?

823
01:12:53,800 --> 01:12:56,000
Well, I just wondered if you...

824
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,900
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

825
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,900
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

826
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:08,800
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

827
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,400
Harry...

828
01:13:16,500 --> 01:13:19,400
...l'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

829
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,800
And...

830
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,700
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

831
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:29,900
Okay. Yeah. Great.

832
01:13:31,200 --> 01:13:34,000
Fine. No problem.

833
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:35,900
Okay. Good.

834
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:38,900
Harry?

835
01:13:39,500 --> 01:13:41,300
I really am...

836
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:43,100
...sorry.

837
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,400
It's all right, Ron.

838
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:57,800
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

839
01:13:57,900 --> 01:13:59,800
What happened to you?

840
01:14:00,100 --> 01:14:02,200
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

841
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:04,900
- What?
- What did she say?

842
01:14:05,100 --> 01:14:06,400
No, of course.

843
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,400
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

844
01:14:11,800 --> 01:14:16,200
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

845
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:20,600
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

846
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:24,200
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

847
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:29,000
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

848
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,900
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

849
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,300
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

850
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:37,500
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

851
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:41,400
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

852
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:43,000
Hey!

853
01:15:00,100 --> 01:15:01,800
Bloody hell.

854
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:05,800
Bloody hell.

855
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:10,600
Bloody...

856
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,000
Oh, bloody...

857
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:18,400
What are those? What are those?

858
01:15:18,600 --> 01:15:21,600
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

859
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:24,800
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

860
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:26,900
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

861
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:32,100
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

862
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,500
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

863
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,100
Murder me, Harry.

864
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:47,000
Leave it alone!

865
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:51,500
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

866
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:54,100
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

867
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,900
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

868
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:00,200
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

869
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:05,500
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

870
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,900
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

871
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,900
Don't you look...

872
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,600
...dashing.

873
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:15,400
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

874
01:16:15,500 --> 01:16:17,400
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

875
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:20,600
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

876
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:21,800
- Are the first to dance.

877
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:24,800
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

878
01:16:25,400 --> 01:16:27,100
Well, now you know.

879
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:32,900
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

880
01:16:33,100 --> 01:16:35,500
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

881
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:37,100
Come along this way.

882
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:43,800
Oh, come on.

883
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,700
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

884
01:16:46,800 --> 01:16:50,200
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

885
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,800
This way. This way. Come along.

886
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:58,800
She looks beautiful!

887
01:16:58,900 --> 01:17:00,500
Yeah, she does.

888
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:51,500
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

889
01:17:52,100 --> 01:17:54,700
No. Absolutely not.

890
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:00,900
Hi!

891
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,700
Harry, take my waist.

892
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:14,000
- What?
- Now!

893
01:19:20,600 --> 01:19:22,400
Are you ready?

894
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,300
Move your body like a hairy troll

895
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:28,500
Learning to rock and roll

896
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:31,500
Spin around like a crazy elf

897
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,200
Dancing by himself

898
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:37,900
Boogie down like a unicorn

899
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,500
No stopping till the break of dawn

900
01:19:40,700 --> 01:19:43,500
Put your hands up in the air

901
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,500
Like an ogre who just don't care

902
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,800
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

903
01:19:52,200 --> 01:19:54,400
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

904
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:59,900
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

905
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:03,400
May I have your arm?

906
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,300
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

907
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,800
Hot, isn't it?

908
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:37,800
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

909
01:20:38,000 --> 01:20:41,700
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

910
01:20:43,300 --> 01:20:45,700
What's got your wand in a knot?

911
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:49,700
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

912
01:20:49,900 --> 01:20:53,400
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

913
01:20:54,100 --> 01:20:56,600
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

914
01:20:56,700 --> 01:21:00,300
...is international
magical cooperation...

915
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,400
...to make friends.

916
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:06,200
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

917
01:21:16,200 --> 01:21:18,500
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

918
01:21:18,700 --> 01:21:20,100
No.

919
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:30,800
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

920
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,200
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

921
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:39,000
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

922
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:41,300
You know the solution then, don't you?

923
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,500
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

924
01:21:43,700 --> 01:21:46,800
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

925
01:21:47,000 --> 01:21:49,000
And not as a last resort.

926
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:53,400
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

927
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:54,900
Harry.

928
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:56,600
Where have you been?

929
01:21:56,800 --> 01:21:59,300
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

930
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:06,200
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

931
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:08,200
What's this about?

932
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:15,500
No, don't let

933
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:21,600
This magic die

934
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:26,100
The answer's there

935
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,600
Let me see it again.

936
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:30,800
Yes, the time is close now.

937
01:23:35,500 --> 01:23:37,400
Harry, at last!

938
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:44,000
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

939
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:56,000
You all right, Harry?

940
01:23:57,400 --> 01:23:59,200
I just got in.

941
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:01,000
Me.

942
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,600
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

943
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:20,000
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

944
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:23,300
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

945
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,300
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

946
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:32,100
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

947
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:39,000
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

948
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,700
Mostly, he watches me study.

949
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:44,600
It's a bit annoying, actually.

950
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:48,700
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

951
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:51,100
What's that supposed to mean?

952
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,600
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

953
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:58,000
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

954
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:00,800
And...

955
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:05,000
...l'm scared for you.

956
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:08,500
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

957
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,600
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

958
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,500
Hey, Potter!

959
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:20,700
- Potter!
- Cedric.

960
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:25,100
How...? How are you?

961
01:25:26,200 --> 01:25:27,600
Spectacular.

962
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:33,000
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

963
01:25:33,100 --> 01:25:35,500
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

964
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,300
Exactly.

965
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,000
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

966
01:25:44,800 --> 01:25:47,400
It's not a bad place for a bath.

967
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:51,700
Just take your egg...

968
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:55,200
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

969
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,600
I must be out of my mind.

970
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,900
I'm definitely out of my mind.

971
01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,900
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

972
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:52,900
Myrtle!

973
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:54,800
Hello, Harry.

974
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,900
Long time no see.

975
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:06,800
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

976
01:27:07,000 --> 01:27:10,400
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

977
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,900
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

978
01:27:13,100 --> 01:27:14,800
Polyjuice Potion?

979
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,600
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

980
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,100
That's what he did.

981
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,600
The other boy...

982
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,100
...the handsome one...

983
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,700
...Cedric.

984
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,700
Well, go on. Open it.

985
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:55,800
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

986
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,700
We cannot sing
Above the ground

987
01:28:00,900 --> 01:28:05,200
An hour long you'll have to look

988
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:10,600
To recover what we took

989
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:20,000
Myrtle...

990
01:28:21,700 --> 01:28:25,100
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

991
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:27,700
Very good.

992
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:32,900
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

993
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:37,200
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

994
01:28:54,900 --> 01:28:56,800
Harry, tell me again.

995
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:01,400
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

996
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,100
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

997
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,600
"An hour long you'll have to look."

998
01:29:07,800 --> 01:29:11,200
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

999
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,500
"Potentially problematic"?

1000
01:29:14,700 --> 01:29:17,900
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1001
01:29:18,500 --> 01:29:22,800
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1002
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:25,500
Hate to break up the skull session.

1003
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:27,600
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1004
01:29:27,900 --> 01:29:30,300
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1005
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:33,100
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1006
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:35,900
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1007
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:37,900
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1008
01:29:38,100 --> 01:29:40,600
Go. Now!

1009
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:52,400
Longbottom!

1010
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:54,600
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1011
01:30:03,200 --> 01:30:05,400
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1012
01:30:05,600 --> 01:30:08,200
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1013
01:30:08,800 --> 01:30:13,100
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1014
01:30:13,300 --> 01:30:17,000
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1015
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,300
...about plants.

1016
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,400
Now, if there's...

1017
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:26,400
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1018
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,000
...then great. But otherwise...

1019
01:30:29,200 --> 01:30:33,000
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1020
01:30:34,200 --> 01:30:37,100
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1021
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:38,700
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1022
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:40,300
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1023
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,600
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1024
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:44,300
Don't be so mean.

1025
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:46,800
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1026
01:30:49,000 --> 01:30:50,900
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1027
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,100
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1028
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:54,700
Most likely?

1029
01:30:54,900 --> 01:30:57,100
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1030
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:59,700
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1031
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:02,600
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1032
01:31:02,700 --> 01:31:04,700
I just wanted to help.

1033
01:31:04,900 --> 01:31:08,000
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1034
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,900
Where are they anyway?

1035
01:31:10,100 --> 01:31:13,100
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1036
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:22,300
Welcome to the second task.

1037
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:26,200
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1038
01:31:26,400 --> 01:31:27,800
A treasure of sorts.

1039
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:30,600
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1040
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:33,400
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1041
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,200
In order to win...

1042
01:31:35,300 --> 01:31:39,200
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1043
01:31:39,300 --> 01:31:42,000
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1044
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:45,800
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1045
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,900
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1046
01:31:50,300 --> 01:31:52,600
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1047
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:22,100
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1048
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:26,400
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1049
01:32:28,300 --> 01:32:30,200
Yeah!

1050
01:32:31,300 --> 01:32:32,900
What?

1051
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:54,700
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1052
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:57,400
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1053
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:01,100
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1054
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,800
But she's my friend too!

1055
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:24,100
Only one!

1056
01:36:15,400 --> 01:36:17,300
Let's get down below.

1057
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:30,100
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1058
01:37:27,700 --> 01:37:29,400
Yes!

1059
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,600
Ascendio!

1060
01:37:54,800 --> 01:37:56,500
Harry!

1061
01:37:58,800 --> 01:38:00,300
He's all right.

1062
01:38:01,500 --> 01:38:02,900
He's all right. Barty!

1063
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:06,500
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1064
01:38:07,100 --> 01:38:10,600
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1065
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,000
My little sister.

1066
01:38:13,400 --> 01:38:14,900
Thank you.

1067
01:38:15,700 --> 01:38:18,500
And you! You helped.

1068
01:38:19,100 --> 01:38:22,100
Well, yeah, a bit.

1069
01:38:29,300 --> 01:38:30,500
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1070
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:33,300
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1071
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:36,500
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1072
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,700
I finished last, Hermione.

1073
01:38:39,600 --> 01:38:43,700
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1074
01:38:43,900 --> 01:38:47,100
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1075
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:50,200
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1076
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,100
Attention!

1077
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:59,400
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1078
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:03,400
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1079
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:06,200
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1080
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:11,300
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1081
01:39:11,500 --> 01:39:15,800
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1082
01:39:16,000 --> 01:39:17,900
...second place...

1083
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,600
- Second place!
- Well done!

1084
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:22,400
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1085
01:39:23,700 --> 01:39:25,200
Yes!

1086
01:39:28,700 --> 01:39:30,500
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1087
01:39:30,700 --> 01:39:32,300
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1088
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:34,900
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1089
01:39:35,000 --> 01:39:37,700
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1090
01:39:37,900 --> 01:39:39,500
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1091
01:39:39,700 --> 01:39:41,200
Well done, boy.

1092
01:39:41,400 --> 01:39:44,600
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1093
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:48,800
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1094
01:39:49,800 --> 01:39:53,300
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1095
01:39:53,500 --> 01:39:55,500
...to lose one's family.

1096
01:39:57,500 --> 01:39:59,600
Never whole again, are we?

1097
01:40:01,900 --> 01:40:04,000
Still, life goes on...

1098
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:06,300
...and here we stand.

1099
01:40:09,200 --> 01:40:11,900
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1100
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,500
Bartemius!

1101
01:40:13,700 --> 01:40:17,800
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1102
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:21,200
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1103
01:40:33,700 --> 01:40:35,600
And they say I'm mad.

1104
01:40:44,900 --> 01:40:48,600
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1105
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,800
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1106
01:40:52,300 --> 01:40:54,900
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1107
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:59,100
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1108
01:40:59,300 --> 01:41:02,600
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1109
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,300
And Harry, of course.

1110
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:09,900
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1111
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:12,100
Hooray!

1112
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:16,000
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1113
01:41:16,200 --> 01:41:18,800
Teach us something, please

1114
01:41:28,800 --> 01:41:30,300
Mr. Crouch?

1115
01:41:37,400 --> 01:41:41,000
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1116
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:42,700
I will not.

1117
01:41:42,900 --> 01:41:47,000
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1118
01:41:47,100 --> 01:41:48,500
Then for once show them some!

1119
01:41:48,600 --> 01:41:52,700
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1120
01:41:52,900 --> 01:41:56,100
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1121
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:59,100
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1122
01:41:59,300 --> 01:42:02,900
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1123
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,800
Oh, Harry!

1124
01:42:09,000 --> 01:42:11,300
Harry, how good to see you again.

1125
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,700
I can come back later, professor.

1126
01:42:13,800 --> 01:42:17,200
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1127
01:42:17,300 --> 01:42:19,900
Minister, after you.

1128
01:42:20,400 --> 01:42:22,400
There you are. Your hat.

1129
01:42:22,600 --> 01:42:26,300
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1130
01:42:26,400 --> 01:42:29,700
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1131
01:44:01,100 --> 01:44:02,700
Professor?

1132
01:44:02,900 --> 01:44:05,400
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1133
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:20,100
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1134
01:44:20,300 --> 01:44:22,200
...to present evidence to this council.

1135
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:25,100
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1136
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:29,300
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1137
01:44:29,500 --> 01:44:34,100
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1138
01:44:34,200 --> 01:44:35,900
Do you accept these terms?

1139
01:44:36,500 --> 01:44:39,200
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1140
01:44:39,500 --> 01:44:42,000
I have names, sir.

1141
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:46,100
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1142
01:44:48,800 --> 01:44:51,300
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1143
01:44:51,500 --> 01:44:53,700
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1144
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:56,500
- Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1145
01:44:56,600 --> 01:44:59,900
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1146
01:45:00,100 --> 01:45:02,500
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1147
01:45:02,600 --> 01:45:03,800
Yeah, the same.

1148
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:07,700
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1149
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:12,200
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1150
01:45:12,300 --> 01:45:14,300
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1151
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:19,200
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1152
01:45:19,400 --> 01:45:22,400
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1153
01:45:22,500 --> 01:45:26,500
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1154
01:45:26,700 --> 01:45:29,700
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1155
01:45:29,800 --> 01:45:33,300
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1156
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:35,700
Silence!

1157
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:39,800
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1158
01:45:39,900 --> 01:45:42,100
...this session is now concluded.

1159
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:44,300
Oh, no, no, no.

1160
01:45:45,200 --> 01:45:46,700
I've heard about one more.

1161
01:45:46,900 --> 01:45:49,400
- What's that?
- The name.

1162
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,100
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1163
01:45:51,300 --> 01:45:53,300
...this person took part
in the capture...

1164
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:55,600
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1165
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:59,300
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1166
01:45:59,500 --> 01:46:01,800
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1167
01:46:02,000 --> 01:46:04,500
Barty Crouch...

1168
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:08,200
...Junior.

1169
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:19,400
Hold him down!

1170
01:46:23,100 --> 01:46:26,700
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1171
01:46:28,400 --> 01:46:30,000
Hello, Father.

1172
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:33,500
You are no son of mine.

1173
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:49,200
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1174
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:52,000
It's a Pensieve.

1175
01:46:52,200 --> 01:46:56,800
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1176
01:46:57,000 --> 01:47:00,500
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1177
01:47:01,000 --> 01:47:04,000
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1178
01:47:04,200 --> 01:47:05,700
...some small detail...

1179
01:47:07,100 --> 01:47:09,300
...something I might have overlooked...

1180
01:47:09,400 --> 01:47:13,600
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1181
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:18,300
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1182
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,000
It's maddening.

1183
01:47:23,300 --> 01:47:25,100
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1184
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:27,900
What exactly happened to him?

1185
01:47:28,100 --> 01:47:32,900
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1186
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:37,200
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1187
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:41,600
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1188
01:47:42,400 --> 01:47:44,500
I had a dream about him.

1189
01:47:46,700 --> 01:47:49,500
It was in the summer, before school.

1190
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:54,700
In the dream, I was in a house.

1191
01:47:54,900 --> 01:47:59,600
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1192
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:03,400
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1193
01:48:03,800 --> 01:48:06,700
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1194
01:48:07,500 --> 01:48:09,100
Always the same one.

1195
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:14,500
Sir, these dreams...

1196
01:48:14,700 --> 01:48:19,900
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1197
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,500
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1198
01:48:25,000 --> 01:48:26,900
I think it's best if you simply...

1199
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:34,300
...cast them away.

1200
01:48:43,600 --> 01:48:47,600
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1201
01:48:56,300 --> 01:48:57,500
Potter!

1202
01:48:57,700 --> 01:49:00,200
What's your hurry?

1203
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:09,100
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1204
01:49:09,300 --> 01:49:11,500
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1205
01:49:12,300 --> 01:49:13,800
Yes, sir.

1206
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:16,200
Ingenious.

1207
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:22,000
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1208
01:49:22,800 --> 01:49:26,300
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1209
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:29,900
Nor is this.

1210
01:49:34,100 --> 01:49:35,800
Know what it is?

1211
01:49:37,100 --> 01:49:38,500
Bubble juice, sir?

1212
01:49:39,100 --> 01:49:41,000
Veritaserum.

1213
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:45,400
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1214
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:50,800
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1215
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,500
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1216
01:49:54,600 --> 01:49:59,500
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1217
01:49:59,700 --> 01:50:04,100
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1218
01:50:05,200 --> 01:50:10,900
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1219
01:50:11,600 --> 01:50:14,900
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1220
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:17,300
...l'm going to find out why!

1221
01:50:44,100 --> 01:50:45,700
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1222
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,500
Sonorus!

1223
01:51:10,700 --> 01:51:16,000
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1224
01:51:16,200 --> 01:51:21,200
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1225
01:51:23,300 --> 01:51:25,100
...and Mr. Potter...

1226
01:51:27,000 --> 01:51:28,700
...are tied for first position...

1227
01:51:28,900 --> 01:51:33,000
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1228
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:37,700
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1229
01:51:38,600 --> 01:51:41,700
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1230
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,700
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1231
01:51:48,900 --> 01:51:51,800
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1232
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:56,500
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1233
01:51:56,900 --> 01:52:00,800
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1234
01:52:03,900 --> 01:52:08,200
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1235
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:11,800
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1236
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:15,000
You see, people change in the maze.

1237
01:52:15,100 --> 01:52:16,800
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1238
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:21,800
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1239
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,200
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1240
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:36,800
Good luck.

1241
01:52:37,200 --> 01:52:39,100
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1242
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:44,100
On the count of three. One...

1243
01:56:11,800 --> 01:56:13,100
Fleur?

1244
01:56:14,700 --> 01:56:16,200
Fleur.

1245
01:56:19,700 --> 01:56:21,600
Periculum!

1246
01:57:00,300 --> 01:57:01,700
Get down!

1247
01:57:02,300 --> 01:57:04,000
Get down!

1248
01:57:04,700 --> 01:57:05,900
Expelliarmus!

1249
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:18,700
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1250
01:57:18,900 --> 01:57:20,900
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1251
01:57:32,600 --> 01:57:34,200
Yes.

1252
01:57:55,100 --> 01:57:56,900
Harry!

1253
01:57:59,200 --> 01:58:00,900
Harry!

1254
01:58:03,300 --> 01:58:04,700
Harry!

1255
01:58:07,200 --> 01:58:08,700
Harry!

1256
01:58:10,700 --> 01:58:12,500
Reducto!

1257
01:58:29,300 --> 01:58:31,800
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1258
01:58:32,200 --> 01:58:36,900
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1259
01:58:37,100 --> 01:58:38,800
For a moment, so did I.

1260
01:58:40,700 --> 01:58:41,800
Some game, huh?

1261
01:58:42,900 --> 01:58:44,300
Some game.

1262
01:58:49,700 --> 01:58:51,300
Go!

1263
01:59:01,500 --> 01:59:04,500
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1264
01:59:04,700 --> 01:59:06,700
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1265
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,100
...three!
...three!

1266
01:59:20,500 --> 01:59:23,500
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1267
01:59:30,500 --> 01:59:31,900
Where are we?

1268
01:59:37,600 --> 01:59:39,200
I've been here before.

1269
01:59:42,900 --> 01:59:44,400
It's a Portkey.

1270
01:59:46,200 --> 01:59:50,500
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1271
01:59:52,600 --> 01:59:56,000
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1272
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:58,100
What are you talking about?

1273
02:00:03,300 --> 02:00:06,200
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1274
02:00:13,900 --> 02:00:16,200
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1275
02:00:16,400 --> 02:00:19,100
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1276
02:00:30,500 --> 02:00:32,300
Do it! Now!

1277
02:00:44,300 --> 02:00:46,800
Bone of the father...

1278
02:00:46,900 --> 02:00:49,200
...unwillingly given.

1279
02:00:56,700 --> 02:00:59,800
Flesh of the servant...

1280
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:05,000
...willingly sacrificed.

1281
02:01:09,100 --> 02:01:12,800
And blood of the enemy...

1282
02:01:18,600 --> 02:01:21,100
...forcibly taken.

1283
02:01:27,200 --> 02:01:30,100
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1284
02:01:30,900 --> 02:01:32,800
...again.

1285
02:02:36,200 --> 02:02:39,600
My wand, Wormtail.

1286
02:02:49,200 --> 02:02:51,100
Hold out your arm.

1287
02:02:51,300 --> 02:02:52,900
Master.

1288
02:02:53,100 --> 02:02:55,700
Thank you, master.

1289
02:02:55,900 --> 02:02:57,300
The other arm, Wormtail.

1290
02:03:38,000 --> 02:03:39,900
Welcome, my friends.

1291
02:03:41,300 --> 02:03:44,100
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1292
02:03:44,700 --> 02:03:50,200
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1293
02:03:51,100 --> 02:03:54,100
I confess myself...

1294
02:03:54,500 --> 02:03:56,100
...disappointed.

1295
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,900
Not one of you tried to find me.

1296
02:03:59,000 --> 02:04:02,400
Crabbe! Macnair!

1297
02:04:03,300 --> 02:04:04,600
Goyle!

1298
02:04:07,100 --> 02:04:08,800
Not even you...

1299
02:04:12,700 --> 02:04:14,600
...Lucius.

1300
02:04:16,400 --> 02:04:21,300
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1301
02:04:21,400 --> 02:04:24,400
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1302
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:29,800
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1303
02:04:31,500 --> 02:04:37,100
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1304
02:04:39,100 --> 02:04:41,700
...that is my true mask.

1305
02:04:42,100 --> 02:04:43,700
I returned.

1306
02:04:46,200 --> 02:04:50,100
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1307
02:04:51,200 --> 02:04:57,000
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1308
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:04,500
Thank you, master.

1309
02:05:05,100 --> 02:05:06,800
Thank you.

1310
02:05:09,900 --> 02:05:12,300
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1311
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,300
Harry.

1312
02:05:15,400 --> 02:05:18,200
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1313
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:22,800
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1314
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,400
I'd introduce you...

1315
02:05:24,500 --> 02:05:28,800
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1316
02:05:31,500 --> 02:05:34,200
The boy who lived.

1317
02:05:34,300 --> 02:05:37,200
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1318
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:41,400
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1319
02:05:41,600 --> 02:05:46,300
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1320
02:05:46,500 --> 02:05:48,100
Yes, shall I?

1321
02:05:48,400 --> 02:05:49,700
It was love.

1322
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:54,400
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1323
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:57,200
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1324
02:05:57,600 --> 02:05:59,400
I could not touch him.

1325
02:06:00,600 --> 02:06:02,800
It was old magic.

1326
02:06:02,900 --> 02:06:05,200
Something I should have foreseen.

1327
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:07,200
But no matter, no matter.

1328
02:06:07,300 --> 02:06:09,500
Things have changed.

1329
02:06:10,300 --> 02:06:13,800
I can touch you...

1330
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,100
...now.

1331
02:06:24,300 --> 02:06:25,600
Yeah.

1332
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:35,700
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1333
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,500
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1334
02:06:40,100 --> 02:06:42,400
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1335
02:06:43,900 --> 02:06:46,300
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1336
02:06:46,400 --> 02:06:48,900
First, we bow to each other.

1337
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:51,400
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1338
02:06:51,600 --> 02:06:54,800
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1339
02:06:55,000 --> 02:06:56,300
I said, bow.

1340
02:06:58,200 --> 02:07:02,500
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1341
02:07:02,900 --> 02:07:04,800
Crucio!

1342
02:07:07,300 --> 02:07:09,000
Crucio!

1343
02:07:10,100 --> 02:07:12,000
Attaboy, Harry.

1344
02:07:12,200 --> 02:07:14,300
Your parents would be proud.

1345
02:07:14,600 --> 02:07:18,000
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1346
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:19,800
Expelliar...

1347
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:25,200
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1348
02:07:25,300 --> 02:07:27,300
I'm going to destroy you.

1349
02:07:29,600 --> 02:07:35,100
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1350
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:38,300
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1351
02:07:38,500 --> 02:07:41,200
...they'll speak only of how you...

1352
02:07:41,500 --> 02:07:43,300
...begged for death.

1353
02:07:43,500 --> 02:07:47,200
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1354
02:07:47,800 --> 02:07:49,400
...obliged.

1355
02:07:49,700 --> 02:07:51,200
Get up!

1356
02:07:56,200 --> 02:07:58,200
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1357
02:07:58,300 --> 02:08:00,600
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1358
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:04,000
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1359
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:19,700
Have it your way.

1360
02:08:20,700 --> 02:08:23,100
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1361
02:08:40,600 --> 02:08:43,300
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1362
02:08:47,900 --> 02:08:49,600
He's mine!

1363
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:26,600
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1364
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:28,900
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1365
02:09:29,000 --> 02:09:30,800
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1366
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:35,000
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1367
02:09:35,200 --> 02:09:37,700
Take my body back to my father.

1368
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:40,100
Let go.

1369
02:09:40,600 --> 02:09:42,500
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1370
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:46,000
Let go! Let go!

1371
02:09:51,800 --> 02:09:53,100
Accio!

1372
02:09:58,800 --> 02:10:00,800
No!

1373
02:10:13,600 --> 02:10:15,200
He did it!

1374
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:18,100
Harry!

1375
02:10:20,900 --> 02:10:22,300
Harry!

1376
02:10:23,600 --> 02:10:26,800
No! No! No, don't!

1377
02:10:27,100 --> 02:10:29,000
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1378
02:10:29,300 --> 02:10:31,800
He's back. He's back.

1379
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,000
Voldemort's back.

1380
02:10:34,200 --> 02:10:36,600
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1381
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:39,100
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1382
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:42,100
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1383
02:10:42,200 --> 02:10:44,500
He's home. You both are.

1384
02:10:44,700 --> 02:10:48,300
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1385
02:10:51,400 --> 02:10:55,100
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1386
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:57,100
Let me through.

1387
02:10:57,200 --> 02:10:58,700
Let me through!

1388
02:11:00,700 --> 02:11:01,900
Let me through!

1389
02:11:02,100 --> 02:11:03,500
That's my son!

1390
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,200
That's my boy!

1391
02:11:09,100 --> 02:11:11,800
It's my boy!

1392
02:11:14,600 --> 02:11:18,200
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1393
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:21,300
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1394
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,200
No!

1395
02:11:27,300 --> 02:11:29,700
It's all right, I got you.

1396
02:11:29,800 --> 02:11:33,200
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1397
02:11:37,200 --> 02:11:39,000
No!

1398
02:11:40,100 --> 02:11:41,900
No!

1399
02:12:24,300 --> 02:12:26,000
Are you all right, Potter?

1400
02:12:26,600 --> 02:12:28,500
Does it hurt? That?

1401
02:12:28,700 --> 02:12:30,500
Not so much now.

1402
02:12:31,500 --> 02:12:33,500
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1403
02:12:36,700 --> 02:12:38,700
The cup was a Portkey.

1404
02:12:41,400 --> 02:12:43,200
Someone had bewitched it.

1405
02:12:43,500 --> 02:12:45,600
What was it like?

1406
02:12:45,900 --> 02:12:47,600
- What was he like?
- Who?

1407
02:12:47,800 --> 02:12:49,500
The Dark Lord.

1408
02:12:51,800 --> 02:12:54,900
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1409
02:12:56,200 --> 02:12:58,000
I don't know.

1410
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,800
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1411
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:08,700
...into one of my nightmares.

1412
02:13:27,500 --> 02:13:29,000
Were there others?

1413
02:13:29,200 --> 02:13:31,500
In the graveyard, were there others?

1414
02:13:35,400 --> 02:13:36,800
I...

1415
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:41,500
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1416
02:13:48,900 --> 02:13:52,200
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1417
02:13:56,600 --> 02:13:59,600
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1418
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:01,700
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1419
02:14:05,200 --> 02:14:08,900
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1420
02:14:09,100 --> 02:14:11,600
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1421
02:14:13,200 --> 02:14:15,900
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1422
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:19,300
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1423
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:21,000
...that led him straight to it?

1424
02:14:29,400 --> 02:14:33,400
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1425
02:14:34,000 --> 02:14:37,600
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1426
02:14:37,800 --> 02:14:39,900
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1427
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:44,100
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1428
02:14:44,300 --> 02:14:45,500
And now the deed is done.

1429
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:51,600
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1430
02:15:00,100 --> 02:15:03,600
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1431
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:07,000
...that I have once and for all...

1432
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:11,900
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1433
02:15:12,100 --> 02:15:13,400
Expelliarmus!

1434
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:19,300
Severus.

1435
02:15:21,800 --> 02:15:23,300
That's it, take it.

1436
02:15:25,300 --> 02:15:28,800
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1437
02:15:28,900 --> 02:15:31,600
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1438
02:15:31,800 --> 02:15:34,900
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1439
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:39,500
Harry, away from there!

1440
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:03,800
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1441
02:16:04,800 --> 02:16:06,800
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1442
02:16:08,600 --> 02:16:09,700
Polyjuice Potion.

1443
02:16:09,900 --> 02:16:13,100
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1444
02:16:13,400 --> 02:16:15,300
We'll get you up in a minute.

1445
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,100
Harry!

1446
02:16:54,800 --> 02:16:57,000
Barty Crouch Junior.

1447
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,200
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1448
02:17:02,600 --> 02:17:03,800
Your arm, Harry.

1449
02:17:08,100 --> 02:17:10,400
You know what this means, don't you?

1450
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:12,600
He's back.

1451
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,900
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1452
02:17:16,900 --> 02:17:19,200
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1453
02:17:19,400 --> 02:17:23,900
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1454
02:17:24,400 --> 02:17:26,900
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1455
02:17:27,500 --> 02:17:30,300
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1456
02:17:50,200 --> 02:17:52,900
Today, we acknowledge...

1457
02:17:53,600 --> 02:17:56,400
...a really terrible loss.

1458
02:17:58,500 --> 02:18:01,200
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1459
02:18:01,400 --> 02:18:03,700
...exceptionally hard-working...

1460
02:18:04,700 --> 02:18:07,000
...infinitely fair-minded...

1461
02:18:07,600 --> 02:18:09,900
...and, most importantly...

1462
02:18:10,200 --> 02:18:14,800
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1463
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:20,300
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1464
02:18:23,300 --> 02:18:24,800
You see...

1465
02:18:25,700 --> 02:18:27,800
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1466
02:18:28,700 --> 02:18:30,700
...by Lord Voldemort!

1467
02:18:32,600 --> 02:18:36,100
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1468
02:18:36,800 --> 02:18:40,500
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1469
02:18:42,700 --> 02:18:44,300
Now, the pain...

1470
02:18:44,500 --> 02:18:48,200
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1471
02:18:48,300 --> 02:18:49,700
...and reminds us...

1472
02:18:49,800 --> 02:18:53,500
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1473
02:18:53,700 --> 02:18:57,100
...our hearts beat as one.

1474
02:18:57,600 --> 02:18:59,700
In light of recent events...

1475
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:04,900
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1476
02:19:05,800 --> 02:19:11,100
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1477
02:19:11,600 --> 02:19:13,700
You remember that...

1478
02:19:14,300 --> 02:19:17,300
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1479
02:19:17,900 --> 02:19:20,400
...kind and honest...

1480
02:19:20,900 --> 02:19:25,500
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1481
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:52,700
I never liked these curtains.

1482
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:56,000
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1483
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:58,200
By accident, of course.

1484
02:20:03,800 --> 02:20:08,200
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1485
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,300
Professor...

1486
02:20:13,500 --> 02:20:16,500
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1487
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:21,700
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1488
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:25,600
Priori Incantatem.

1489
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:32,500
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1490
02:20:33,100 --> 02:20:34,900
They reappeared.

1491
02:20:36,400 --> 02:20:40,100
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1492
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:45,300
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1493
02:20:45,800 --> 02:20:50,600
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1494
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:55,600
But remember this:

1495
02:20:55,800 --> 02:20:57,800
You have friends here.

1496
02:20:59,800 --> 02:21:01,500
You're not alone.

1497
02:21:22,200 --> 02:21:23,900
Hermione.

1498
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:26,300
This is for you.

1499
02:21:27,000 --> 02:21:29,100
Write to me. Promise.

1500
02:21:30,300 --> 02:21:31,700
Bye.

1501
02:21:37,900 --> 02:21:39,800
Au revoir, Ron.

1502
02:22:23,800 --> 02:22:26,300
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1503
02:22:26,500 --> 02:22:27,600
- No.
- No.

1504
02:22:27,800 --> 02:22:32,200
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1505
02:22:36,600 --> 02:22:39,400
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1506
02:22:46,700 --> 02:22:48,200
Yes.

1507
02:22:52,900 --> 02:22:56,200
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1508
02:22:56,400 --> 02:22:58,900
I won't. You know I won't.

1509
02:23:00,200 --> 02:23:04,000
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
