1
00:01:47,166 --> 00:01:49,566
Bloody kids.

2
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:39,677
How fastidious you've become,
Wormtail.

3
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:44,254
As I recall, you once called
the nearest gutter pipe home.

4
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:49,622
Could it be that the task of nursing me
has become wearisome for you?

5
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:52,263
Oh, no. No, no, my Lord Voldemort.

6
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:53,692
I only meant...

7
00:02:53,865 --> 00:02:56,834
...perhaps if we were to do it
without the boy.

8
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,402
No! The boy is everything!

9
00:02:59,571 --> 00:03:03,098
It cannot be done without him.
And it will be done.

10
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:05,937
Exactly as I said.

11
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:10,040
- I will not disappoint you, my Lord.
- Good.

12
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:13,275
First, gather our old comrades.

13
00:03:13,452 --> 00:03:15,682
Send them a sign.

14
00:03:27,399 --> 00:03:30,891
Nagini tells me
the old Muggle caretaker...

15
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:34,766
...is standing just outside the door.

16
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:40,242
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

17
00:03:40,412 --> 00:03:42,243
Avada Kedavra!

18
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:48,776
Harry.

19
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,182
Harry!

20
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:54,288
Are you all right?

21
00:03:54,993 --> 00:03:57,086
Hermione. Bad dream.

22
00:03:57,262 --> 00:04:00,629
- When did you get here?
- Just now. You?

23
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,027
Last night.

24
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,430
Wake up! Wake up, Ronald!

25
00:04:04,603 --> 00:04:05,865
Bloody hell.

26
00:04:06,038 --> 00:04:07,562
Honestly, get dressed.

27
00:04:08,307 --> 00:04:10,036
And don't go back to sleep.

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,541
Come on, Ron!
Your mother says breakfast's ready!

29
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,051
- Ron, where are we actually going?
- Don't know.

30
00:04:23,522 --> 00:04:26,787
- Hey, Dad. Where are we going?
- Haven't the foggiest.

31
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,482
Keep up!

32
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:32,894
Arthur!

33
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:35,056
It's about time, son.

34
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:39,602
Sorry, Amos. Some of us
had a bit of a sleepy start.

35
00:04:39,771 --> 00:04:45,437
This is Amos Diggory, everyone.
Works with me at the Ministry.

36
00:04:45,644 --> 00:04:48,135
And this strapping young lad
must be Cedric, am I right?

37
00:04:48,313 --> 00:04:49,473
Yes, sir.

38
00:04:49,648 --> 00:04:51,309
This way.

39
00:04:53,051 --> 00:04:56,418
Merlin's beard!
You must be Harry Potter.

40
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,318
- Yes, sir.
- Great, great pleasure.

41
00:04:59,491 --> 00:05:01,288
Pleasure to meet you too, sir.

42
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,591
Yes, it's just over there.

43
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,664
- Shall we?
- Oh, yeah.

44
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:12,030
We don't want to be late.

45
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:16,334
Come on. Nearly there now.
Get yourself into a good position.

46
00:05:17,342 --> 00:05:19,674
Why are they all standing around
that manky old boot?

47
00:05:19,845 --> 00:05:22,336
- That isn't just any manky old boot.
- It's a Portkey.

48
00:05:22,514 --> 00:05:23,879
Time to go!

49
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:25,641
What's a Portkey?

50
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:29,844
- Ready! After three. One, two...
- Harry!

51
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:31,113
...three!

52
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:43,293
Let go, kids!

53
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,062
- What?!
- Let go!

54
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:00,676
I'll bet that cleared your sinuses, eh?

55
00:06:01,753 --> 00:06:04,221
- Total shambles, as per usual.
- Thanks.

56
00:06:10,028 --> 00:06:12,155
Go on, look at that!

57
00:06:12,397 --> 00:06:16,925
Well, kids, welcome to
the Quidditch World Cup!

58
00:06:19,938 --> 00:06:22,566
Stay together! Keep up, girls!

59
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:25,371
Look!

60
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,542
Come on! Keep up, girls!

61
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:36,853
Blimey!

62
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,887
Parting of the ways, I think, old chap.

63
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:40,456
- See you at the match.
- See you.

64
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:41,922
- Cedric.
- Ced, come on.

65
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,788
See you later, Cedric.

66
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,493
Home sweet home.

67
00:06:52,304 --> 00:06:53,828
What?

68
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:03,146
- Excellent, excellent.
- Ginny, look!

69
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:04,612
- All to the bath.
- Look.

70
00:07:04,783 --> 00:07:07,274
Girls, choose a bunk and unpack.

71
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,320
Ron, get out of the kitchen.
We're all hungry.

72
00:07:10,489 --> 00:07:12,957
- Yeah, get out of the kitchen, Ron!
- Feet off the table!

73
00:07:13,124 --> 00:07:15,388
- Feet off the table!
- Feet off the table!

74
00:07:16,628 --> 00:07:18,823
I love magic.

75
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:37,571
Get your Quidditch World Cup
programs here!

76
00:07:37,816 --> 00:07:40,979
Blimey, Dad. How far up are we?

77
00:07:41,152 --> 00:07:42,585
Well, put it this way:

78
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:44,550
If it rains...

79
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:47,089
...you'll be the first to know.

80
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:50,226
Father and I are in
the minister's box...

81
00:07:50,395 --> 00:07:53,660
...by personal invitation
of Cornelius Fudge himself.

82
00:07:53,832 --> 00:07:56,027
Don't boast, Draco.

83
00:07:56,201 --> 00:07:58,294
There's no need with these people.

84
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:03,297
Do enjoy yourself, won't you?

85
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,506
While you can.

86
00:08:18,924 --> 00:08:23,588
Come on up. Take your seats. I told you
these seats would be worth waiting for.

87
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,627
Come on!

88
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:29,834
It's the Irish! There's Troy!

89
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,832
- And Mullet!
- And Moran!

90
00:08:37,509 --> 00:08:40,410
Ireland! Ireland! Ireland!

91
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,846
- Here come the Bulgarians!
- Yes!

92
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:55,290
Who's that?

93
00:08:56,027 --> 00:08:59,087
That, sis, is the best Seeker
in the world.

94
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:04,659
Krum! Krum! Krum!

95
00:09:09,407 --> 00:09:10,635
Krum!

96
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:12,538
Yes!

97
00:09:20,285 --> 00:09:22,185
Good evening!

98
00:09:22,721 --> 00:09:25,713
As Minister for Magic...

99
00:09:25,957 --> 00:09:28,983
...it gives me great pleasure...

100
00:09:29,594 --> 00:09:33,360
...to welcome
each and every one of you...

101
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:39,401
...to the final
of the 422nd Quidditch World Cup!

102
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,403
Let the match...

103
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:43,365
...begin!

104
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:51,675
Krum! Krum! Krum!

105
00:09:59,524 --> 00:10:01,185
There's no one like Krum.

106
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,951
- Krum?
- Dumb Krum?

107
00:10:03,128 --> 00:10:06,188
He's like a bird,
the way he rides the wind.

108
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:09,265
- He's more than an athlete.
- Dumb Krum.

109
00:10:09,434 --> 00:10:10,833
He's an artist.

110
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,266
- I think you're in love, Ron.
- Shut up.

111
00:10:13,438 --> 00:10:14,837
Viktor, I love you

112
00:10:15,006 --> 00:10:16,598
Viktor, I do

113
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:20,006
When we're apart
My heart beats only for you

114
00:10:20,178 --> 00:10:22,840
Sounds like the Irish
have got their pride on.

115
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:24,743
Stop! Stop it!

116
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:26,875
It's not the Irish.

117
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,180
We've gotta get out of here. Now!

118
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,656
Get out, it's the Death Eaters!

119
00:10:34,826 --> 00:10:38,193
Get back to the Portkey, everybody,
and stick together!

120
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:41,025
Fred, George!
Ginny is your responsibility.

121
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:43,329
Go!

122
00:10:43,501 --> 00:10:45,332
Harry!

123
00:11:00,151 --> 00:11:02,312
- Keep up, you lot!
- Harry!

124
00:11:03,588 --> 00:11:05,715
Harry! Harry!

125
00:11:53,371 --> 00:11:54,861
Morsmordre!

126
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,123
Harry!

127
00:12:24,602 --> 00:12:27,833
- Where are you?
- Harry!

128
00:12:29,073 --> 00:12:31,701
We've been looking for you for ages!

129
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:34,642
Thought we lost you, mate.

130
00:12:35,446 --> 00:12:37,437
What is that?

131
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,611
Stupefy!

132
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:44,118
Stop!

133
00:12:44,289 --> 00:12:46,519
That's my son!

134
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,221
- Ron, Harry, Hermione, you all right?
- We came back for Harry.

135
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,692
Which of you conjured it?

136
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:54,024
- Crouch, you can't possi...
- Do not lie!

137
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,190
You've been discovered
at the scene of the crime.

138
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:58,392
- Crime?
- Barty! They're just kids.

139
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:00,060
What crime?

140
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:02,729
It's the Dark Mark, Harry. It's his mark.

141
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,067
What, Voldemort?

142
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:09,111
Those people tonight, in the masks,
they're his too, aren't they?

143
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,510
- His followers?
- Yeah.

144
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,581
Death Eaters.

145
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:18,346
- Follow me.
- There was a man, before.

146
00:13:18,823 --> 00:13:20,188
There!

147
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,656
All of you, this way!

148
00:13:23,394 --> 00:13:24,827
A man, Harry?

149
00:13:25,129 --> 00:13:26,596
Who?

150
00:13:27,031 --> 00:13:28,794
I don't know.

151
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,630
I didn't see his face.

152
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:50,878
Anything from the trolley?

153
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:56,119
Anything from the trolley?

154
00:14:00,064 --> 00:14:01,793
Anything from the trolley, dears?

155
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,161
Packet of Drooble's...

156
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:06,132
...and a Licorice Wand.

157
00:14:07,605 --> 00:14:09,664
On second thought, just the Drooble's.

158
00:14:09,841 --> 00:14:13,834
- It's all right, I'll get it. Don't worry.
- Just the Drooble's. Thanks.

159
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:17,513
Two Pumpkin Pasties, please.

160
00:14:22,887 --> 00:14:24,514
Thank you.

161
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,351
Anything sweet for you, dear?

162
00:14:28,192 --> 00:14:30,524
Oh, no, I'm not hungry. Thank you.

163
00:14:31,429 --> 00:14:33,454
Anything from the trolley?

164
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:35,656
This is horrible.

165
00:14:36,034 --> 00:14:38,764
How can the Ministry
not know who conjured it?

166
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:40,699
Wasn't there any security or...?

167
00:14:40,872 --> 00:14:43,670
Loads, according to Dad.

168
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:47,800
That's what worried them so much.
Happened right under their noses.

169
00:14:50,415 --> 00:14:53,851
It's hurting again, isn't it? Your scar.

170
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,679
I'm fine.

171
00:14:57,722 --> 00:15:00,623
You know Sirius will
want to hear about this...

172
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:04,751
...what you saw at the World Cup
and the dream.

173
00:15:13,204 --> 00:15:16,401
Hedwig. There we go.

174
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,878
Clear the runway!

175
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,051
Well, there's something
you don't see every day.

176
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:34,951
Well, now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement.

177
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,354
This castle will not only be
your home this year...

178
00:16:39,524 --> 00:16:42,687
...but home to some
very special guests as well.

179
00:16:43,061 --> 00:16:45,689
You see, Hogwarts has been chosen...

180
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,121
Yes, what is it?

181
00:16:48,332 --> 00:16:49,697
What is it?

182
00:16:52,036 --> 00:16:55,369
Tell them to wait.
Tell them to wait. Wait.

183
00:16:55,573 --> 00:17:01,512
So Hogwarts has been chosen
to host a legendary event:

184
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,738
The Triwizard Tournament.

185
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:06,341
- For those of you who do not know...
- Brilliant.

186
00:17:06,517 --> 00:17:09,680
...the Triwizard Tournament
brings together three schools...

187
00:17:09,854 --> 00:17:11,981
...for a series of magical contests.

188
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:15,683
From each school, a single student
is selected to compete.

189
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,555
Now let me be clear.

190
00:17:17,728 --> 00:17:20,663
If chosen, you stand alone.

191
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,766
And trust me when I say...

192
00:17:22,934 --> 00:17:25,903
...these contests are not
for the faint-hearted.

193
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:30,538
But more of that later.
For now, please join me in welcoming...

194
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:34,735
...the lovely ladies of the
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic...

195
00:17:34,912 --> 00:17:38,905
...and their headmistress,
Madame Maxime.

196
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,020
Bloody hell.

197
00:18:00,872 --> 00:18:03,204
Blimey. That's one big woman.

198
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,288
And now our friends from the north.

199
00:18:27,465 --> 00:18:30,298
Please greet the proud sons
of Durmstrang...

200
00:18:30,468 --> 00:18:33,301
...and their high master,
lgor Karkaroff.

201
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,918
Oh, it's Krum!

202
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,562
Blimey, it's him!

203
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:01,595
Viktor Krum!

204
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:11,941
Albus.

205
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,838
Igor.

206
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,121
Professor Dumbly-dorr,
my horses have traveled a long way.

207
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,820
- They will need attending to.
- Don't worry, Madame Maxime.

208
00:19:33,998 --> 00:19:37,525
Our gamekeeper, Hagrid,
is more than capable of seeing to them.

209
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:39,966
But you know, Monsieur Hagrid...

210
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,837
...they drink only single-malt whiskey.

211
00:19:49,013 --> 00:19:50,742
You idiot!

212
00:19:55,753 --> 00:19:57,744
Your attention, please!

213
00:20:00,091 --> 00:20:02,252
I'd like to say a few words.

214
00:20:03,995 --> 00:20:06,054
Eternal glory.

215
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:10,524
That is what awaits the student
who wins the Triwizard Tournament.

216
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:14,899
But to do this, that student
must survive three tasks.

217
00:20:15,072 --> 00:20:19,031
Three extremely dangerous tasks.

218
00:20:19,477 --> 00:20:20,466
- Wicked.
- Wicked.

219
00:20:20,645 --> 00:20:24,877
For this reason, the Ministry has seen fit
to impose a new rule.

220
00:20:25,049 --> 00:20:26,414
To explain all this...

221
00:20:26,584 --> 00:20:30,213
...we have the head of the Department
of International Magical Cooperation...

222
00:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,549
...Mr. Bartemius Crouch.

223
00:20:46,971 --> 00:20:49,701
Bloody hell. It's Mad-Eye Moody.

224
00:20:50,474 --> 00:20:53,671
- Alastor Moody? The Auror?
- Auror?

225
00:20:53,844 --> 00:20:57,302
Dark-wizard catcher. Half the cells
in Azkaban are filled thanks to him.

226
00:20:58,015 --> 00:21:01,109
He's supposed to be mad as a hatter,
though, these days.

227
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:16,663
- My dear old friend, thanks for coming.
- Stupid ceiling.

228
00:21:16,834 --> 00:21:17,926
Thank you.

229
00:21:24,442 --> 00:21:26,307
What's that he's drinking,
do you suppose?

230
00:21:26,744 --> 00:21:29,736
I don't know, but I don't think
it's pumpkin juice.

231
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:38,655
After due consideration...

232
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:41,724
...the Ministry has concluded that,
for their own safety...

233
00:21:41,892 --> 00:21:44,861
...no student under the age of 17...

234
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:48,760
...shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the Triwizard Tournament.

235
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,629
- This decision is final.
- That's rubbish!

236
00:21:51,802 --> 00:21:54,396
That's rubbish!
You don't know what you're doing!

237
00:21:54,572 --> 00:21:58,303
- Silence!
- They're not too happy about that, then.

238
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:20,129
The Goblet of Fire.

239
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:23,599
Anyone wishing to submit themselves
to the tournament...

240
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:26,669
...need only write their name
upon a piece of parchment...

241
00:22:26,837 --> 00:22:29,931
...and throw it in the flame before
this hour on Thursday night.

242
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:33,271
Do not do so lightly.

243
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:37,205
If chosen, there's no turning back.

244
00:22:37,381 --> 00:22:42,341
As from this moment,
the Triwizard Tournament has begun.

245
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,571
Alastor Moody.

246
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,143
Ex-Auror...

247
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,287
...Ministry malcontent...

248
00:23:18,489 --> 00:23:20,889
...and your new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

249
00:23:21,058 --> 00:23:25,518
I am here because Dumbledore asked me.
End of story, goodbye, the end.

250
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,459
Any questions?

251
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:32,363
When it comes to the Dark Arts...

252
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:36,399
...I believe in a practical approach.

253
00:23:36,574 --> 00:23:42,274
But first, which of you can tell me
how many Unforgivable Curses there are?

254
00:23:42,813 --> 00:23:45,145
- Three, sir.
- And they are so named?

255
00:23:45,316 --> 00:23:48,547
Because they are unforgivable.
The use of any one of them will...

256
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:52,849
Will earn you a one-way ticket
to Azkaban, correct.

257
00:23:53,023 --> 00:23:55,753
The Ministry says you're too young
to see what these curses do.

258
00:23:55,926 --> 00:23:59,384
I say different! You need to know
what you're up against!

259
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,724
You need to be prepared.

260
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,367
You need to find another place
to put your chewing gum...

261
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,833
...besides the underside of your desk,
Mr. Finnigan!

262
00:24:07,004 --> 00:24:09,996
No way. The old codger
can see out the back of his head.

263
00:24:10,708 --> 00:24:12,471
And hear across classrooms!

264
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:18,304
So which curse shall we see first?

265
00:24:18,482 --> 00:24:19,710
- Weasley!
- Yes?

266
00:24:19,884 --> 00:24:21,215
Stand.

267
00:24:24,388 --> 00:24:26,151
Give us a curse.

268
00:24:26,323 --> 00:24:30,191
Well, my dad did tell me about one.

269
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,023
The lmperius Curse.

270
00:24:32,196 --> 00:24:35,495
Oh, yeah, your father
would know all about that.

271
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,562
Gave the Ministry quite a bit of grief
a few years ago.

272
00:24:39,036 --> 00:24:41,527
Perhaps this will show you why.

273
00:24:49,146 --> 00:24:50,477
Hello.

274
00:24:52,116 --> 00:24:53,811
Lovely little beauty.

275
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:58,945
Engorgio.

276
00:24:59,323 --> 00:25:00,984
Imperio!

277
00:25:05,396 --> 00:25:07,830
Don't worry. It's completely harmless.

278
00:25:14,004 --> 00:25:15,665
If she bites...

279
00:25:16,206 --> 00:25:17,696
...she's lethal.

280
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:22,041
What are you laughing at?

281
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,813
Get off!

282
00:25:27,251 --> 00:25:29,014
Talented, isn't she?

283
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:32,587
What should I have her do next?
Jump out the window?

284
00:25:34,558 --> 00:25:35,957
Drown herself?

285
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:51,003
Scores of witches and wizards
have claimed...

286
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:55,168
...that they only did
You-Know-Who's bidding...

287
00:25:55,346 --> 00:25:57,576
...under the influence
of the lmperius Curse.

288
00:25:57,748 --> 00:25:59,682
But here's the rub:

289
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,009
How do we sort out the liars?

290
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:07,051
Another, another.

291
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:09,582
Up, up. Come on.

292
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,318
Longbottom, is it?

293
00:26:11,996 --> 00:26:13,486
Up.

294
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:19,400
Professor Sprout tells me
you have an aptitude for herbology.

295
00:26:21,305 --> 00:26:22,932
There's the...

296
00:26:23,173 --> 00:26:25,107
The Cruciatus Curse.

297
00:26:25,275 --> 00:26:28,142
Correct, correct. Come, come.

298
00:26:28,345 --> 00:26:29,972
Particularly nasty.

299
00:26:33,017 --> 00:26:34,848
The torture curse.

300
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:38,014
Crucio!

301
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:54,534
Stop it! Can't you see
it's bothering him? Stop it!

302
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:16,149
Perhaps you could give us the last
Unforgivable Curse, Miss Granger.

303
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,926
No?

304
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:23,258
Avada Kedavra!

305
00:27:27,037 --> 00:27:28,561
The Killing Curse.

306
00:27:29,707 --> 00:27:32,835
Only one person is known
to have survived it...

307
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,776
...and he's sitting in this room.

308
00:28:07,377 --> 00:28:09,140
Brilliant, isn't he?

309
00:28:09,313 --> 00:28:13,340
Completely demented, of course, and
terrifying to be in the same room with...

310
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:16,680
...but he's really been there, you know?
He's looked evil in the eye.

311
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:19,448
There's a reason those curses
are unforgivable.

312
00:28:19,623 --> 00:28:23,719
To perform them in a classroom...
I mean, did you see Neville's face?

313
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,130
Neville?

314
00:28:28,298 --> 00:28:29,731
Son?

315
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,727
You all right?

316
00:28:32,703 --> 00:28:36,070
Come on. We'll have a cup of tea.
I want to show you something.

317
00:28:50,621 --> 00:28:52,612
We're gonna be late!

318
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:08,535
Come on, Cedric. Put it in!

319
00:29:24,154 --> 00:29:26,645
Eternal glory. Be brilliant, wouldn't it?

320
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:29,452
Three years from now,
when we're old enough to be chosen.

321
00:29:29,626 --> 00:29:31,253
Yeah, rather you than me.

322
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,362
Yes!

323
00:29:35,566 --> 00:29:37,466
Thank you, thank you.

324
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:40,694
- Well, lads, we've done it.
- Cooked it up just this morning.

325
00:29:40,871 --> 00:29:43,032
It's not going to work.

326
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,732
- Oh, yeah?
- And why is that, Granger?

327
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:49,879
You see this? This is an Age Line.

328
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:51,844
Dumbledore drew it himself.

329
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:53,448
So?

330
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:58,647
So a genius like Dumbledore
couldn't possibly be fooled...

331
00:29:58,822 --> 00:30:01,814
...by a dodge as pathetically dimwitted
as an Aging Potion.

332
00:30:01,992 --> 00:30:06,258
- But that's why it's so brilliant.
- Because it's so pathetically dimwitted.

333
00:30:07,998 --> 00:30:09,989
- Ready, Fred?
- Ready, George.

334
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:11,998
- Bottoms up.
- Bottoms up.

335
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:17,339
- Yes!
- Yes!

336
00:30:18,208 --> 00:30:19,675
Yeah!

337
00:30:20,844 --> 00:30:22,471
Yes!

338
00:30:22,913 --> 00:30:24,403
Ready?

339
00:30:27,718 --> 00:30:29,845
- Yes!
- Yes!

340
00:30:38,395 --> 00:30:40,363
- You said!
- You said!

341
00:30:41,331 --> 00:30:44,767
- Oh, right, you want a piece of me?!
- I'll tear your ears off!

342
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:47,426
- Now you're making me laugh.
- Take this! Come on!

343
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:49,037
Fight! Fight! Fight!

344
00:30:54,144 --> 00:30:55,873
We're "old school," right?

345
00:30:56,046 --> 00:30:58,446
Yeah, but you look older!

346
00:31:29,813 --> 00:31:32,475
Sit down. Please.

347
00:31:35,886 --> 00:31:38,753
Now the moment
you've all been waiting for:

348
00:31:38,922 --> 00:31:41,049
The champion selection.

349
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:16,289
The Durmstrang champion
is Viktor Krum.

350
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,642
The champion for Beauxbatons...

351
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,836
...is Fleur Delacour.

352
00:32:47,391 --> 00:32:50,383
The Hogwarts champion, Cedric Diggory!

353
00:33:00,437 --> 00:33:04,840
Excellent! We now have
our three champions.

354
00:33:05,008 --> 00:33:09,206
But in the end,
only one will go down in history.

355
00:33:09,379 --> 00:33:12,712
Only one will hoist
this chalice of champions...

356
00:33:13,016 --> 00:33:16,042
...this vessel of victory...

357
00:33:16,219 --> 00:33:18,414
...the Triwizard Cup!

358
00:33:49,186 --> 00:33:50,847
Harry Potter.

359
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:54,583
Harry Potter?

360
00:33:58,962 --> 00:34:01,157
No. No.

361
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,962
Harry Potter!

362
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,890
Go on, Harry.

363
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,831
Harry, for goodness sake.

364
00:34:38,335 --> 00:34:39,529
He's a cheat!

365
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:42,630
He's not even 17 yet!

366
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:13,992
- It's wrong, I tell you!
- You French tart.

367
00:35:14,171 --> 00:35:17,140
- Everything is a conspiracy theory with you!
- Quiet! I can't think!

368
00:35:17,307 --> 00:35:19,298
- Everything is a conspiracy theory!
- I protest.

369
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:20,670
- Harry.
- I protest!

370
00:35:20,844 --> 00:35:22,709
Did you put your name
in the Goblet of Fire?

371
00:35:22,879 --> 00:35:25,040
- No, sir.
- Did you ask one of the older students...

372
00:35:25,215 --> 00:35:26,546
...to do it for you?
- No, sir.

373
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:29,617
- You're absolutely sure?
- Yes. Yes, sir.

374
00:35:30,053 --> 00:35:32,283
- But of course he is lying.
- The hell he is!

375
00:35:32,489 --> 00:35:34,855
The Goblet of Fire is an exceptionally
powerful magical object.

376
00:35:35,025 --> 00:35:38,153
Only an exceptionally powerful
Confundus Charm could have hoodwinked it.

377
00:35:38,328 --> 00:35:40,319
Magic way beyond the talents
of a fourth year.

378
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:43,489
You seem to have given this
a fair bit of thought, Mad-Eye.

379
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,830
It was once my job to think
as dark wizards do, Karkaroff...

380
00:35:47,003 --> 00:35:50,097
...perhaps you remember.
- This doesn't help, Alastor.

381
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,173
Leave this to you, Barty.

382
00:35:55,545 --> 00:35:57,740
The rules are absolute.

383
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:02,680
The Goblet of Fire constitutes
a binding magical contract.

384
00:36:04,221 --> 00:36:06,416
Mr. Potter has no choice.

385
00:36:07,224 --> 00:36:09,556
He is, as of tonight...

386
00:36:11,361 --> 00:36:13,386
...a Triwizard champion.

387
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,451
This can't go on, Albus.

388
00:36:43,793 --> 00:36:46,626
First the Dark Mark. Now this?

389
00:36:46,796 --> 00:36:48,787
What do you suggest, Minerva?

390
00:36:49,966 --> 00:36:52,025
Put an end to it.

391
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,493
Don't let Potter compete.

392
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,139
You heard Barty. The rules are clear.

393
00:36:57,307 --> 00:37:00,140
Well, the devil with Barty
and his rules.

394
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:02,744
And since when did you
accommodate the Ministry?

395
00:37:02,912 --> 00:37:06,905
Headmaster, I, too, find it difficult
to believe this mere coincidence.

396
00:37:07,083 --> 00:37:11,019
However, if we are to truly discover
the meaning of these events...

397
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:14,782
...perhaps we should,
for the time being...

398
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,956
...let them unfold.

399
00:37:18,128 --> 00:37:20,289
What...? Do nothing?

400
00:37:20,463 --> 00:37:22,090
Offer him up as bait?

401
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,932
Potter is a boy, not a piece of meat.

402
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:29,566
I agree. With Severus.

403
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,973
Alastor, keep an eye on Harry, will you?

404
00:37:33,243 --> 00:37:35,711
- I can do that.
- Don't let him know, though.

405
00:37:35,979 --> 00:37:39,073
He must be anxious enough as it is...

406
00:37:39,616 --> 00:37:42,278
...knowing what lies ahead.

407
00:37:42,652 --> 00:37:45,212
Then again, we all are.

408
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,900
How did you do it?

409
00:38:03,373 --> 00:38:08,003
Never mind. Doesn't matter.
Might've let your best friend know, though.

410
00:38:08,178 --> 00:38:11,477
- Let you know what?
- You know bloody well what.

411
00:38:11,648 --> 00:38:14,048
I didn't ask for this to happen, Ron.

412
00:38:14,517 --> 00:38:16,109
Okay?

413
00:38:16,286 --> 00:38:18,777
- You're being stupid.
- Yeah, that's me.

414
00:38:18,955 --> 00:38:22,482
Ron Weasley,
Harry Potter's stupid friend.

415
00:38:26,196 --> 00:38:28,164
I didn't put my name in that cup.

416
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,432
I don't want eternal glory.
I just wanna be...

417
00:38:34,204 --> 00:38:38,664
Look, I don't know what happened tonight,
and I don't know why.

418
00:38:38,842 --> 00:38:40,070
It just did.

419
00:38:40,944 --> 00:38:42,502
Okay?

420
00:38:51,321 --> 00:38:53,084
Piss off.

421
00:39:08,104 --> 00:39:10,572
What a charismatic quartet.

422
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:13,500
Hello.

423
00:39:14,377 --> 00:39:16,937
I'm Rita Skeeter.

424
00:39:17,514 --> 00:39:20,005
I write for the Daily Prophet.

425
00:39:20,617 --> 00:39:25,316
But of course you know that, don't you?
It's you we don't know.

426
00:39:25,855 --> 00:39:27,686
You're the juicy news.

427
00:39:27,857 --> 00:39:32,055
What quirks lurk
beneath those rosy cheeks?

428
00:39:32,262 --> 00:39:35,720
What mysteries do the muscles mask?

429
00:39:35,899 --> 00:39:39,130
Does courage lie beneath those curls?

430
00:39:39,302 --> 00:39:42,328
In short, what makes a champion tick?

431
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:47,139
"Me, Myself & l" want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers.

432
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:49,801
So who's feeling up to sharing?

433
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:55,710
Shall we start with the youngest?
Lovely.

434
00:40:07,997 --> 00:40:09,794
This is cozy.

435
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,061
It's a broom cupboard.

436
00:40:12,435 --> 00:40:14,733
You should feel right at home, then.

437
00:40:14,938 --> 00:40:17,702
Don't mind if I use
a Quick-Quotes Quill, do you?

438
00:40:17,874 --> 00:40:19,432
No.

439
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:21,800
So tell me, Harry.

440
00:40:21,978 --> 00:40:24,879
Here you sit, a mere boy of 12...

441
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,538
I'm 14. Sorry.

442
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:29,685
- About to compete
against three students...

443
00:40:29,853 --> 00:40:33,118
...not only vastly more
emotionally mature than yourself...

444
00:40:33,289 --> 00:40:35,883
...but who have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt...

445
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:38,391
...in your dizziest daydreams.

446
00:40:38,895 --> 00:40:40,920
Concerned?

447
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:44,931
I don't know.
I haven't really thought about it.

448
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:46,966
Just ignore the quill.

449
00:40:47,437 --> 00:40:49,962
Then, of course,
you're no ordinary boy of 12, are you?

450
00:40:50,139 --> 00:40:52,733
- Fourteen.
- Your story's legend.

451
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,671
Do you think it was
the trauma of your past...

452
00:40:55,845 --> 00:40:59,076
...that made you so keen to enter
such a dangerous tournament?

453
00:40:59,249 --> 00:41:01,012
No, I didn't enter.

454
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,776
Of course you didn't.

455
00:41:05,054 --> 00:41:06,681
Everyone loves a rebel, Harry.

456
00:41:08,992 --> 00:41:10,516
Scratch that last.

457
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:15,458
Speaking of your parents, were they alive,
how do you think they'd feel?

458
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:17,429
Proud? Or concerned...

459
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,434
...that your attitude shows, at best,
a pathological need for attention...

460
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:24,198
...at worst, a psychotic death wish?

461
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:30,271
Hey, my eyes aren't
"glistening with the ghosts of my past."

462
00:42:02,579 --> 00:42:04,911
Harry, I couldn't risk sending Hedwig.

463
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:08,346
Since the World Cup, the Ministry's
been intercepting more and more owls...

464
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:10,748
...and she's too easily recognized.

465
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,787
We need to talk, Harry, face-to-face.

466
00:42:13,957 --> 00:42:18,121
Meet me in the Gryffindor common room,
1:00 this Saturday night.

467
00:42:18,294 --> 00:42:20,057
And make sure you're alone.

468
00:42:20,229 --> 00:42:21,719
Sirius.

469
00:42:21,898 --> 00:42:23,388
P. S:

470
00:42:23,566 --> 00:42:25,363
The bird bites.

471
00:42:35,712 --> 00:42:37,145
Sirius?

472
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,930
Harry Potter, age 12...

473
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:59,068
...suspect entrant
in the Triwizard Tournament.

474
00:42:59,235 --> 00:43:01,829
His eyes swimming
with the ghosts of his past...

475
00:43:02,005 --> 00:43:03,563
...and choking back tears...

476
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,649
Sirius. How...?

477
00:43:21,824 --> 00:43:24,315
I don't have much time,
so let me get straight to it.

478
00:43:24,494 --> 00:43:27,429
Did you or did you not put your name
into the Goblet of Fire?

479
00:43:27,597 --> 00:43:29,064
No!

480
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:30,928
I had to ask.

481
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:35,901
Now, tell me about this dream of yours.
You mentioned Wormtail and Voldemort.

482
00:43:36,072 --> 00:43:38,506
But who was the third man in the room?

483
00:43:38,675 --> 00:43:41,166
- I don't know.
- You didn't hear a name?

484
00:43:42,011 --> 00:43:43,535
No.

485
00:43:44,447 --> 00:43:48,178
Voldemort was giving him a job to do.
Something important.

486
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,648
And what was that?

487
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:53,448
He wanted...

488
00:43:53,623 --> 00:43:55,284
...me.

489
00:43:55,858 --> 00:44:00,192
I don't know why. But he was
gonna use this man to get to me.

490
00:44:01,464 --> 00:44:03,625
But, I mean, it was only a dream, right?

491
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,627
Yes.

492
00:44:05,802 --> 00:44:07,360
It's just a dream.

493
00:44:08,104 --> 00:44:09,537
Look, Harry.

494
00:44:09,706 --> 00:44:13,164
The Death Eaters at the World Cup,
your name rising from that goblet...

495
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:17,335
...these are not just coincidences.
Hogwarts isn't safe anymore.

496
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:18,605
What are you saying?

497
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:23,047
I'm saying the devils are inside
the walls. Igor Karkaroff?

498
00:44:23,219 --> 00:44:27,622
He was a Death Eater. And no one,
no one stops being a Death Eater.

499
00:44:28,057 --> 00:44:33,188
Then there's Barty Crouch. Heart of stone.
Sent his own son to Azkaban.

500
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,093
You think one of them
put my name in the goblet?

501
00:44:40,269 --> 00:44:42,567
I haven't a clue who put your name
in that goblet...

502
00:44:42,739 --> 00:44:46,698
...but whoever did is no friend to you.
People die in this tournament.

503
00:44:46,876 --> 00:44:50,368
- I'm not ready for this, Sirius.
- You don't have a choice.

504
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:56,316
- Someone's coming.
- Keep your friends close, Harry.

505
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:00,953
Who were you talking to?

506
00:45:01,124 --> 00:45:04,184
- What? Who says I was talking to anyone?
- I heard voices.

507
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:08,453
Maybe you're imagining things.
Wouldn't be the first time.

508
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:12,331
You're probably just practicing
for your next interview, I expect.

509
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:39,888
Amazing.

510
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:45,561
- Amazing!
- Neville. You're doing it again.

511
00:45:46,135 --> 00:45:47,534
Right, sorry.

512
00:45:48,404 --> 00:45:51,396
"Magical Water Plants
of the Highland Lochs"?

513
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:54,737
Moody gave it to me.
That day we had tea.

514
00:45:56,245 --> 00:45:57,974
It's already been through enough people.

515
00:45:58,147 --> 00:46:00,240
Why don't you just go
and talk to him yourself?

516
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:04,049
Ron, this is your problem, not mine.

517
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,313
What do you want me to say again?

518
00:46:06,489 --> 00:46:07,820
Go.

519
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,924
Ronald would like me to tell you
that Seamus told him...

520
00:46:15,498 --> 00:46:19,093
...that Dean was told by Parvati
that Hagrid's looking for you.

521
00:46:19,268 --> 00:46:21,702
Is that right? Well, you...

522
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:22,929
What?

523
00:46:28,044 --> 00:46:30,979
- Are you sure you won't do this?
- Do it.

524
00:46:33,783 --> 00:46:36,752
Dean was told by Parvati that...

525
00:46:37,987 --> 00:46:40,217
Please don't ask me to say it again.

526
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,057
Hagrid's looking for you.

527
00:46:42,558 --> 00:46:45,618
- Well, you can tell Ronald...
- I'm not an owl!

528
00:46:56,172 --> 00:46:58,436
Did you bring your father's cloak,
like I asked you?

529
00:46:58,608 --> 00:47:01,202
Yeah, I brought the cloak.
Hagrid, where are we going?

530
00:47:01,377 --> 00:47:02,776
You'll see soon enough.

531
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,140
Now pay attention, this is important.

532
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:08,350
What's with the flower?

533
00:47:09,385 --> 00:47:11,785
Hagrid, have you combed your hair?

534
00:47:12,188 --> 00:47:13,917
As a matter of fact, I have.

535
00:47:14,357 --> 00:47:17,292
You might like to try the same thing
now and again.

536
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:27,268
Hagrid?

537
00:47:31,173 --> 00:47:33,073
The cloak! Put the cloak on!

538
00:47:39,615 --> 00:47:43,016
- Bonsoir, Olympe.
- Oh, Hagrid.

539
00:47:43,185 --> 00:47:46,916
I thought perhaps you weren't coming.
I thought perhaps...

540
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:49,751
...you had forgotten me.

541
00:47:49,926 --> 00:47:51,894
Couldn't forget you, Olympe.

542
00:47:52,528 --> 00:47:54,359
What is it you wanted to show me?

543
00:47:56,032 --> 00:47:59,263
When we spoke earlier,
you sounded so...

544
00:47:59,602 --> 00:48:01,092
...exhilarated.

545
00:48:01,671 --> 00:48:04,504
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.

546
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:16,847
Can we get closer?

547
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:26,127
Dragons?

548
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:27,785
That's the first task?

549
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,222
- You're joking.
- Come on, Harry.

550
00:48:31,500 --> 00:48:34,526
These are seriously
misunderstood creatures.

551
00:48:35,638 --> 00:48:37,105
Oh, crikey!

552
00:48:37,606 --> 00:48:42,600
Although, I have to admit,
that Horntail is a right nasty piece of work.

553
00:48:42,912 --> 00:48:45,745
Poor Ron nearly fainted
just seeing him, you know.

554
00:48:47,249 --> 00:48:49,274
- Ron was here?
- Oh, sure.

555
00:48:49,452 --> 00:48:52,979
His brother Charlie helped
to bring him over from Romania.

556
00:48:53,155 --> 00:48:54,588
Didn't Ron tell you that?

557
00:48:56,525 --> 00:48:57,924
No, he didn't.

558
00:48:58,661 --> 00:49:00,526
He didn't tell me a thing.

559
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:13,567
- You cheat, Potter.
- You stink, Potter.

560
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:17,739
- Good luck, Potter.
- Potter stinks!

561
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:20,575
- Cedric rules.
- Thanks.

562
00:49:21,650 --> 00:49:23,311
Like the badge?

563
00:49:23,886 --> 00:49:25,615
Excuse me.

564
00:49:29,792 --> 00:49:31,259
Harry.

565
00:49:31,827 --> 00:49:33,795
Hey! Read the badge, Potter!

566
00:49:33,963 --> 00:49:35,453
Can I have a word?

567
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:38,297
- All right.
- You stink, Potter!

568
00:49:38,467 --> 00:49:41,459
- Potter, you stink!
- Harry Potter smells!

569
00:49:43,973 --> 00:49:46,533
Dragons. That's the first task.

570
00:49:46,709 --> 00:49:49,837
- They've got one for each of us.
- Come on, Ced!

571
00:49:50,012 --> 00:49:52,037
Are you serious?

572
00:49:52,815 --> 00:49:55,841
And Fleur and Krum, do they...?

573
00:49:56,018 --> 00:49:58,282
- Yes.
- Come on, Ced, leave him.

574
00:49:58,454 --> 00:49:59,921
- Right.
- He's not worth it.

575
00:50:00,089 --> 00:50:02,580
- Read the badges, Potter!
- Hey, listen. About the badges.

576
00:50:02,758 --> 00:50:05,784
- I've asked them not to wear them, but...
- Don't worry about it.

577
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:08,395
It's not like I try
to blow things up, exactly.

578
00:50:09,098 --> 00:50:10,565
It just happens a fair bit.

579
00:50:10,733 --> 00:50:13,793
You have to admit, though,
fire's pretty fascinating.

580
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,800
You're a right foul git, you know that?

581
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,235
- You think so?
- I know so.

582
00:50:18,407 --> 00:50:19,738
Anything else?

583
00:50:19,909 --> 00:50:23,401
- Yeah. Stay away from me.
- Fine.

584
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:29,376
- There's Potter. Cheat.
- Why so tense, Potter?

585
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,552
My father and I have a bet, you see.

586
00:50:32,721 --> 00:50:35,918
I don't think you're gonna last
10 minutes in this tournament.

587
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:41,429
He disagrees.
He thinks you won't last five.

588
00:50:41,597 --> 00:50:44,725
I don't give a damn
what your father thinks, Malfoy.

589
00:50:45,701 --> 00:50:49,694
He's vile and cruel.
And you're just pathetic.

590
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:53,200
- Pathetic?
- Oh, no, you don't, sonny!

591
00:50:55,377 --> 00:50:58,278
I'll teach you to curse someone
when their back is turned!

592
00:50:58,447 --> 00:51:02,281
You stinking, cowardly, scummy...

593
00:51:02,451 --> 00:51:04,180
- Professor Moody!
...back-shooting...

594
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:07,254
- What are you doing?
- Teaching.

595
00:51:08,290 --> 00:51:12,420
- Is that a...? Is that a student?
- Technically, it's a ferret.

596
00:51:18,067 --> 00:51:20,001
Stand still! Stand still!

597
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:33,175
- My father will hear about this!
- Is that a threat?

598
00:51:33,349 --> 00:51:35,283
- Professor Moody!
- Is that a threat?

599
00:51:35,451 --> 00:51:37,316
Professor!

600
00:51:37,486 --> 00:51:41,047
I could tell you stories about your father
that would curl even your greasy hair!

601
00:51:41,223 --> 00:51:43,919
- Alastor! Alastor.
- It doesn't end here!

602
00:51:44,093 --> 00:51:47,893
We never use transfiguration
as a punishment!

603
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,258
Surely Dumbledore told you that.

604
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:55,259
- He might've mentioned it.
- Well, you will do well to remember it.

605
00:51:56,372 --> 00:51:57,839
Away!

606
00:52:00,943 --> 00:52:03,138
You. Come with me.

607
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,439
That's a Foe-Glass.

608
00:52:41,183 --> 00:52:43,344
Lets me keep an eye on my enemies.

609
00:52:43,752 --> 00:52:48,155
If I can see the whites of their eyes,
they're standing right behind me.

610
00:52:52,328 --> 00:52:54,796
Wouldn't even bother telling you
what's in there.

611
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:56,989
You wouldn't believe it if I did.

612
00:52:57,266 --> 00:52:58,961
Now...

613
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:03,469
...what are you going to do
about your dragon?

614
00:53:07,376 --> 00:53:09,674
Well, you know, I just thought I'd...

615
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,636
Sit.

616
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:17,751
Listen to me, Potter.

617
00:53:18,754 --> 00:53:19,914
Your pal Diggory?

618
00:53:20,089 --> 00:53:24,549
By your age, he could turn a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the time.

619
00:53:25,694 --> 00:53:26,956
Miss Delacour?

620
00:53:27,363 --> 00:53:30,093
She's as much a fairy princess as I am.

621
00:53:30,599 --> 00:53:34,160
As for Krum, his head
may be filled with sawdust...

622
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,497
...but Karkaroff's is not.

623
00:53:36,672 --> 00:53:38,503
They'll have a strategy.

624
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:42,201
And you can bet that it will
play to Krum's strengths.

625
00:53:46,982 --> 00:53:48,540
Come on, Potter.

626
00:53:48,717 --> 00:53:50,810
What are your strengths?

627
00:53:52,388 --> 00:53:53,753
I don't know.

628
00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:56,720
Well, I can fly.
I mean, I'm a fair flyer. But I...

629
00:53:56,892 --> 00:54:00,919
- Better than fair, the way I heard it.
- But I'm not allowed a broom.

630
00:54:01,096 --> 00:54:04,725
You're allowed a wand.

631
00:54:11,173 --> 00:54:12,640
Bets! Place your bets!

632
00:54:12,808 --> 00:54:14,969
Bets taken! Bets taken here!

633
00:54:15,144 --> 00:54:18,079
Step up, folks! Who fancies a flutter
in today's bloodbath?

634
00:54:18,247 --> 00:54:21,114
Smart money's on Krum to survive!
Any bets?

635
00:54:21,283 --> 00:54:22,773
Yes, sir?

636
00:54:23,118 --> 00:54:25,848
Ten-to-1 for Fleur. There you go.
Thank you very much.

637
00:54:26,355 --> 00:54:28,289
Your attention, please.

638
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:31,118
This is a great day for all of us.

639
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:38,795
Each of the three tasks involves
very considerable danger.

640
00:54:38,967 --> 00:54:41,663
Please keep your seats at all times.

641
00:54:41,837 --> 00:54:44,567
This will minimize any risks
you may be exposed to.

642
00:54:44,740 --> 00:54:48,176
- Harry? Is that you?
- Yeah.

643
00:54:48,344 --> 00:54:50,039
I'm sure we all wish our champions...

644
00:54:50,212 --> 00:54:53,272
- How are you feeling? Okay?
...the greatest of luck.

645
00:54:55,584 --> 00:54:58,985
The key is to concentrate.
After that, you just have to...

646
00:54:59,154 --> 00:55:00,985
Battle a dragon.

647
00:55:05,294 --> 00:55:07,785
Young love.

648
00:55:08,497 --> 00:55:09,759
How...

649
00:55:12,234 --> 00:55:13,531
...stirring.

650
00:55:16,205 --> 00:55:19,368
If everything goes unfortunately today...

651
00:55:19,541 --> 00:55:22,305
...you two may even
make the front page.

652
00:55:22,478 --> 00:55:24,708
You have no business here.

653
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,905
This tent is for champions...

654
00:55:27,249 --> 00:55:28,944
...and friends.

655
00:55:31,754 --> 00:55:35,918
No matter. We've got what we wanted.

656
00:55:39,061 --> 00:55:41,859
Good day, champions.
Gather round, please.

657
00:55:42,030 --> 00:55:46,228
Now, you've waited, you've wondered,
and at last the moment has arrived.

658
00:55:46,402 --> 00:55:49,633
A moment only four of you
can fully appreciate.

659
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,932
What are you doing here, Miss Granger?

660
00:55:53,242 --> 00:55:54,903
Sorry, I'll just go.

661
00:55:55,077 --> 00:55:56,669
Barty, the bag.

662
00:55:57,045 --> 00:55:59,275
Champions, in a circle around me.

663
00:55:59,448 --> 00:56:02,542
Miss Delacour, over here. Mr. Krum.

664
00:56:02,718 --> 00:56:06,654
And, Potter, Mr. Potter, over here.
That's right. Now...

665
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:09,256
...Miss Delacour, if you will.

666
00:56:13,328 --> 00:56:14,989
The Welsh Green.

667
00:56:19,635 --> 00:56:20,966
Mr. Krum.

668
00:56:23,939 --> 00:56:25,839
The Chinese Fireball.

669
00:56:32,314 --> 00:56:34,714
The Swedish Short-Snout.

670
00:56:35,184 --> 00:56:37,175
- Which leaves...
- The Horntail.

671
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:39,616
- What's that, boy?
- Nothing.

672
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,425
The Hungarian Horntail.

673
00:56:47,596 --> 00:56:50,724
These represent four
very real dragons...

674
00:56:50,899 --> 00:56:53,959
...each of which has been given
a golden egg to protect.

675
00:56:54,136 --> 00:56:56,604
Your objective is simple:

676
00:56:56,772 --> 00:56:58,262
Collect the egg.

677
00:56:58,440 --> 00:57:01,432
This you must do,
for each egg contains a clue...

678
00:57:01,610 --> 00:57:05,102
...without which you cannot hope
to proceed to the next task.

679
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,611
Any questions?

680
00:57:07,649 --> 00:57:10,311
Very well. Good luck, champions.

681
00:57:10,486 --> 00:57:13,319
Mr. Diggory, at the sound of the cannon,
you may...

682
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:25,764
Diggory! Diggory! Diggory!

683
00:57:37,346 --> 00:57:40,713
Three of our champions
have now faced their dragons...

684
00:57:40,883 --> 00:57:44,375
...and so each one of them
will proceed to the next task.

685
00:57:44,953 --> 00:57:48,047
And now our fourth and final contestant.

686
00:57:50,025 --> 00:57:53,586
Harry! Harry! Harry!

687
00:59:00,696 --> 00:59:03,631
Your wand, Harry! Your wand!

688
00:59:04,132 --> 00:59:06,157
Accio Firebolt!

689
00:59:35,163 --> 00:59:37,324
- Yeah!
- Yes!

690
00:59:46,241 --> 00:59:47,674
Oh, my God.

691
00:59:57,319 --> 01:00:00,618
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Well done, dragon!

692
01:02:32,607 --> 01:02:34,768
Yes! Yes!

693
01:02:57,999 --> 01:03:00,695
- Yes, Harry!
- Knew you wouldn't die, Harry. Lose a leg.

694
01:03:00,869 --> 01:03:02,803
- Or an arm.
- Pack it in altogether?

695
01:03:02,971 --> 01:03:04,734
- Never!
- Never!

696
01:03:06,842 --> 01:03:08,173
Shush!

697
01:03:08,643 --> 01:03:11,305
Go on, Harry. What's the clue?

698
01:03:12,347 --> 01:03:15,180
- Who wants me to open it?
- Yes!

699
01:03:15,984 --> 01:03:18,509
- Do you want me to open it?
- Yes!

700
01:03:29,698 --> 01:03:32,098
What the bloody hell was that?

701
01:03:36,238 --> 01:03:38,968
All right, everyone!
Go back to your knitting.

702
01:03:39,140 --> 01:03:43,167
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosy sods listening in.

703
01:03:46,348 --> 01:03:50,341
I reckon you have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the Goblet of Fire.

704
01:03:50,685 --> 01:03:53,415
Caught on, have you?
Took you long enough.

705
01:03:54,556 --> 01:03:56,649
I wasn't the only one
who thought you'd done it.

706
01:03:56,825 --> 01:03:59,089
Everyone was saying it behind your back.

707
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:04,527
Brilliant. That makes me
feel loads better.

708
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:08,868
- Least I warned you about the dragons.
- Hagrid warned me about the dragons.

709
01:04:09,037 --> 01:04:10,504
No, no, no, I did.

710
01:04:10,672 --> 01:04:13,698
No, don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you...

711
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:17,936
...that Seamus told me that Parvati
told Dean that Hagrid was looking for you.

712
01:04:18,113 --> 01:04:22,049
Seamus never actually told me anything,
so it was really me all along.

713
01:04:23,051 --> 01:04:26,043
I thought we'd be all right, you know...

714
01:04:26,288 --> 01:04:28,279
...after you'd figured that out.

715
01:04:28,657 --> 01:04:31,319
Who...? Who could possibly
figure that out?

716
01:04:31,993 --> 01:04:33,426
That's completely mental.

717
01:04:33,595 --> 01:04:36,621
Yeah. Isn't it?

718
01:04:36,798 --> 01:04:38,823
I suppose I was a bit distraught.

719
01:04:41,436 --> 01:04:43,131
Boys.

720
01:05:07,595 --> 01:05:09,028
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

721
01:05:12,667 --> 01:05:15,261
Cho, Harry's looking at you.

722
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,902
Shush.

723
01:05:21,609 --> 01:05:22,974
Look at this!

724
01:05:24,980 --> 01:05:27,471
I can't believe it! She's done it again.

725
01:05:28,516 --> 01:05:30,746
"Miss Granger,
a plain but ambitious girl...

726
01:05:30,919 --> 01:05:33,683
...seems to be developing a taste
for famous wizards.

727
01:05:33,855 --> 01:05:36,119
Her latest prey, sources report...

728
01:05:36,291 --> 01:05:39,920
...is none other than the
Bulgarian bonbon, Viktor Krum.

729
01:05:40,228 --> 01:05:44,164
No word yet on how Harry Potter's
taking this latest emotional blow."

730
01:05:45,533 --> 01:05:47,467
Parcel for you, Mr. Weasley.

731
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:49,125
Thank you, Nigel.

732
01:05:53,942 --> 01:05:56,775
Not now, Nigel. Later.

733
01:05:58,613 --> 01:06:00,137
Go on.

734
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:08,251
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.

735
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:12,221
Oh, look, Mum's sent me something.

736
01:06:20,368 --> 01:06:22,199
Mum sent me a dress.

737
01:06:22,370 --> 01:06:26,170
Well, it does match your eyes.
Is there a bonnet?

738
01:06:26,641 --> 01:06:28,472
Nose down, Harry.

739
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:32,969
- Ginny, these must be for you.
- I'm not wearing that, it's ghastly.

740
01:06:34,716 --> 01:06:36,547
What are you on about?

741
01:06:36,718 --> 01:06:38,652
They're not for Ginny.

742
01:06:38,820 --> 01:06:40,219
They're for you.

743
01:06:41,189 --> 01:06:44,955
- Dress robes.
- Dress robes? For what?

744
01:06:46,194 --> 01:06:48,355
The Yule Ball...

745
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:53,866
...has been a tradition
of the Triwizard Tournament...

746
01:06:54,602 --> 01:06:56,661
...since its inception.

747
01:06:57,338 --> 01:07:01,206
On Christmas Eve night,
we and our guests...

748
01:07:01,376 --> 01:07:03,037
...gather in the Great Hall...

749
01:07:03,211 --> 01:07:07,272
...for a night of well-mannered frivolity.

750
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:11,081
As representatives of the host school...

751
01:07:11,252 --> 01:07:16,349
...I expect each and every one of you
to put your best foot forward.

752
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:19,286
And I mean this literally, because...

753
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:23,898
...the Yule Ball is, first and foremost...

754
01:07:24,766 --> 01:07:26,256
...a dance.

755
01:07:30,505 --> 01:07:32,302
Silence!

756
01:07:32,507 --> 01:07:35,499
The house of Godric Gryffindor
has commanded the respect...

757
01:07:35,677 --> 01:07:38,305
...of the wizard world
for nearly 10 centuries.

758
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:42,541
I will not have you, in the course of
a single evening, besmirching that name...

759
01:07:42,717 --> 01:07:46,915
...by behaving like a babbling,
bumbling band of baboons.

760
01:07:47,655 --> 01:07:49,623
Try saying that five times fast, huh?

761
01:07:49,791 --> 01:07:51,281
Now, to dance...

762
01:07:51,459 --> 01:07:55,156
...is to let the body breathe.

763
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:58,663
Inside every girl,
a secret swan slumbers...

764
01:07:58,833 --> 01:08:01,199
...longing to burst forth and take flight.

765
01:08:01,369 --> 01:08:05,362
Something's about to burst out of Eloise
Midgen, but I don't think it's a swan.

766
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,668
Inside every boy,
a lordly lion prepared to prance.

767
01:08:08,843 --> 01:08:11,073
- Mr. Weasley.
- Yes?

768
01:08:11,246 --> 01:08:13,680
Will you join me, please?

769
01:08:18,286 --> 01:08:21,813
Now, place your right hand on my waist.

770
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:24,550
- Where?
- My waist.

771
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:27,286
And extend your arm.

772
01:08:27,729 --> 01:08:29,697
Mr. Filch, if you please.

773
01:08:32,767 --> 01:08:34,758
One, two, three.

774
01:08:34,936 --> 01:08:38,428
One, two, three. One, two, three.

775
01:08:42,143 --> 01:08:44,270
Never gonna let him forget this, are you?

776
01:08:44,445 --> 01:08:45,605
- Never.
- Never.

777
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:49,648
Everybody come together.
Boys, on your feet!

778
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,674
Why do they have to travel in packs?

779
01:09:14,842 --> 01:09:17,504
How are you supposed to get one
on their own to ask them?

780
01:09:25,353 --> 01:09:28,845
Blimey, Harry. You've slayed dragons.
If you can't get a date, who can?

781
01:09:29,023 --> 01:09:31,287
I think I'd take the dragon right now.

782
01:09:37,498 --> 01:09:39,056
I take after my mum.

783
01:09:39,234 --> 01:09:43,170
Though I didn't know her very well.
She left when I was about 3.

784
01:09:43,338 --> 01:09:45,272
No, not the maternal sort, her.

785
01:09:45,440 --> 01:09:49,001
Broke me dad's heart, though.
He was a tiny little fella, my dad.

786
01:09:49,177 --> 01:09:53,705
I could pick him up at the age of 6 with
one hand and put him up on the dresser.

787
01:09:53,881 --> 01:09:56,213
He laughed so hard at that.

788
01:09:58,286 --> 01:10:00,151
Very funny.

789
01:10:06,094 --> 01:10:09,825
And then he died
just when I started school, so...

790
01:10:09,998 --> 01:10:13,024
So I sort of had to make
me own way, as it were.

791
01:10:13,468 --> 01:10:15,698
But enough of me. What about you?

792
01:10:32,887 --> 01:10:37,984
This is mad. At this rate, we'll be
the only ones in our year without dates.

793
01:10:40,261 --> 01:10:42,991
Well, us and Neville.

794
01:10:43,164 --> 01:10:45,826
Yeah, but, then again,
he can take himself.

795
01:10:46,567 --> 01:10:49,900
It might interest you to know
that Neville's already got someone.

796
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,136
Now I'm really depressed.

797
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:03,439
"Get a move on or all the good ones
will have gone."

798
01:11:05,486 --> 01:11:07,454
Who you going with, then?

799
01:11:10,191 --> 01:11:11,886
- Oi, Angelina?
- What?

800
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:17,362
Do you wanna go to the ball with me?

801
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:19,428
To the ball?

802
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:21,067
Yeah, all right.

803
01:11:24,772 --> 01:11:26,330
Oi, Hermione.

804
01:11:26,507 --> 01:11:28,134
You're a girl.

805
01:11:28,309 --> 01:11:29,640
Very well spotted.

806
01:11:29,811 --> 01:11:31,745
Come with one of us?

807
01:11:36,384 --> 01:11:39,285
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone.

808
01:11:39,454 --> 01:11:40,944
For a girl, it's just sad.

809
01:11:41,122 --> 01:11:44,888
I won't be going alone, because,
believe it or not, someone's asked me!

810
01:11:51,833 --> 01:11:53,824
And I said yes!

811
01:11:55,670 --> 01:11:57,262
Bloody hell.

812
01:11:57,438 --> 01:11:59,099
She's lying, right?

813
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,501
If you say so.

814
01:12:01,209 --> 01:12:04,508
Look, we've just gotta
grit our teeth and do it.

815
01:12:04,679 --> 01:12:08,581
Tonight, when we get back to the common
room, we'll both have partners. Agreed?

816
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,308
Agreed.

817
01:12:34,675 --> 01:12:36,006
- Cho!
- Harry!

818
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:42,310
Watch yourself on the stairs.
It's a bit icy at the top.

819
01:12:42,483 --> 01:12:44,075
Okay, thanks.

820
01:12:48,523 --> 01:12:49,581
Cho?

821
01:12:50,525 --> 01:12:52,083
Yes?

822
01:12:53,461 --> 01:12:55,691
Well, I just wondered if you...

823
01:12:55,863 --> 01:12:58,525
I wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

824
01:13:00,334 --> 01:13:02,598
Sorry, I didn't catch that.

825
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:08,407
I was just wondering if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me.

826
01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:16,007
Harry...

827
01:13:16,184 --> 01:13:19,017
...l'm sorry, but someone's
already asked me.

828
01:13:20,021 --> 01:13:21,454
And...

829
01:13:22,123 --> 01:13:25,354
Well, I've said I'll go with him.

830
01:13:27,028 --> 01:13:29,588
Okay. Yeah. Great.

831
01:13:30,898 --> 01:13:33,628
Fine. No problem.

832
01:13:33,935 --> 01:13:35,527
Okay. Good.

833
01:13:36,804 --> 01:13:38,533
Harry?

834
01:13:39,173 --> 01:13:40,970
I really am...

835
01:13:41,142 --> 01:13:42,769
...sorry.

836
01:13:52,553 --> 01:13:54,043
It's all right, Ron.

837
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:57,419
It's okay, Ron. It's all right.
It doesn't matter.

838
01:13:57,592 --> 01:13:59,457
What happened to you?

839
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,888
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

840
01:14:02,063 --> 01:14:04,554
- What?
- What did she say?

841
01:14:04,732 --> 01:14:06,097
No, of course.

842
01:14:07,668 --> 01:14:11,001
- She said yes?
- Don't be silly.

843
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:15,842
There she was, walking by.
You know how I like it when they walk.

844
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:20,206
I couldn't help it.
It just sort of slipped out.

845
01:14:20,381 --> 01:14:23,839
Actually, he sort of screamed at her.
It was a bit frightening.

846
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:28,614
- And what did you do then?
- What else? I ran for it.

847
01:14:28,789 --> 01:14:32,520
I'm not cut out for this, Harry.
I don't know what got into me.

848
01:14:32,693 --> 01:14:33,921
- Hi, Harry.
- Hi, Harry.

849
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:37,155
I always liked looking at them
from behind.

850
01:14:38,499 --> 01:14:41,059
She's never gonna forgive me, ever.

851
01:14:41,702 --> 01:14:42,691
Hey!

852
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,482
Bloody hell.

853
01:15:03,724 --> 01:15:05,487
Bloody hell.

854
01:15:08,996 --> 01:15:10,293
Bloody...

855
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:11,692
Oh, bloody...

856
01:15:15,403 --> 01:15:18,099
What are those? What are those?

857
01:15:18,272 --> 01:15:21,298
- My dress robes.
- Well, they're all right!

858
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:24,410
No lace. No dodgy little collar.

859
01:15:24,579 --> 01:15:26,513
Well, I expect yours are more traditional.

860
01:15:26,681 --> 01:15:31,709
Traditional?! They're ancient!
I look like my Great Aunt Tessie!

861
01:15:34,088 --> 01:15:37,148
I smell like my Great Aunt Tessie.

862
01:15:41,896 --> 01:15:43,727
Murder me, Harry.

863
01:15:45,132 --> 01:15:46,690
Leave it alone!

864
01:15:47,668 --> 01:15:51,104
Poor kid. I bet she's alone in her room,
crying her eyes out.

865
01:15:51,272 --> 01:15:53,740
- Who?
- Hermione, of course.

866
01:15:53,908 --> 01:15:57,503
Come on, Harry, why do you think she
wouldn't tell us who she's coming with?

867
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:59,873
Because we'd take the mickey out of her
if she did.

868
01:16:00,047 --> 01:16:05,144
Nobody asked her. Would've taken her
myself if she wasn't so bloody proud.

869
01:16:06,120 --> 01:16:07,519
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, boys.

870
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:09,519
Don't you look...

871
01:16:10,091 --> 01:16:11,285
...dashing.

872
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:15,022
There you are, Potter.
Are you and Miss Patil ready?

873
01:16:15,196 --> 01:16:17,027
- Ready, professor?
- To dance.

874
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:20,224
It's traditional that the three champions...
Well, in this case, four.

875
01:16:20,401 --> 01:16:21,459
- Are the first to dance.

876
01:16:21,802 --> 01:16:24,430
- Surely I told you that.
- No.

877
01:16:25,006 --> 01:16:26,735
Well, now you know.

878
01:16:28,242 --> 01:16:32,542
As for you, Mr. Weasley, you may proceed
into the Great Hall with Miss Patil.

879
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,113
- Oh, there you are.
- Come on, then.

880
01:16:35,282 --> 01:16:36,772
Come along this way.

881
01:16:41,656 --> 01:16:43,487
Oh, come on.

882
01:16:44,325 --> 01:16:46,316
- Hi.
- Now, I need you all to line up...

883
01:16:46,494 --> 01:16:49,861
...in the procession, please.
Oh, you are very late.

884
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:54,466
This way. This way. Come along.

885
01:16:56,170 --> 01:16:58,400
She looks beautiful!

886
01:16:58,572 --> 01:17:00,164
Yeah, she does.

887
01:17:47,555 --> 01:17:51,116
Is that Hermione Granger?
With Viktor Krum?

888
01:17:51,759 --> 01:17:54,319
No. Absolutely not.

889
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:00,591
Hi!

890
01:18:09,343 --> 01:18:11,334
Harry, take my waist.

891
01:18:12,213 --> 01:18:13,646
- What?
- Now!

892
01:19:20,214 --> 01:19:22,079
Are you ready?

893
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:24,914
Move your body like a hairy troll

894
01:19:25,686 --> 01:19:28,154
Learning to rock and roll

895
01:19:28,556 --> 01:19:31,150
Spin around like a crazy elf

896
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:33,889
Dancing by himself

897
01:19:34,195 --> 01:19:37,528
Boogie down like a unicorn

898
01:19:37,698 --> 01:19:40,132
No stopping till the break of dawn

899
01:19:40,301 --> 01:19:43,134
Put your hands up in the air

900
01:19:43,337 --> 01:19:46,101
Like an ogre who just don't care

901
01:19:46,807 --> 01:19:49,469
Can you dance like a Hippogriff?

902
01:19:51,812 --> 01:19:54,007
Ruddy pumpkinhead, isn't he?

903
01:19:56,183 --> 01:19:59,584
I don't think it was the books
that had him going to the library.

904
01:20:01,522 --> 01:20:03,046
May I have your arm?

905
01:20:03,224 --> 01:20:05,954
Arm. Leg. I'm yours.

906
01:20:31,852 --> 01:20:33,444
Hot, isn't it?

907
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:37,454
Viktor's gone to go and get drinks.
Would you care to join us?

908
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:41,322
No, we'd not care to join you and Viktor.

909
01:20:42,997 --> 01:20:45,329
What's got your wand in a knot?

910
01:20:45,633 --> 01:20:49,330
He's a Durmstrang.
You're fraternizing with the enemy.

911
01:20:49,503 --> 01:20:53,064
The enemy?
Who was it wanting his autograph?

912
01:20:53,774 --> 01:20:56,208
Besides, the whole point
of the tournament...

913
01:20:56,377 --> 01:20:59,904
...is international
magical cooperation...

914
01:21:00,481 --> 01:21:02,039
...to make friends.

915
01:21:02,716 --> 01:21:05,879
I think he's got a bit more
than friendship on his mind.

916
01:21:15,863 --> 01:21:18,195
Are you going to ask me
to dance or not?

917
01:21:18,365 --> 01:21:19,798
No.

918
01:21:28,042 --> 01:21:30,476
- He's using you.
- How dare you?!

919
01:21:30,644 --> 01:21:34,842
- Besides, I can take care of myself.
- I doubt it. He's way too old.

920
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:38,678
- What?! What? That's what you think?
- Yeah, that's what I think.

921
01:21:38,852 --> 01:21:40,979
You know the solution then, don't you?

922
01:21:41,155 --> 01:21:43,146
- Go on.
- Next time there's a ball...

923
01:21:43,324 --> 01:21:46,452
...pluck up the courage and ask me
before somebody else does!

924
01:21:46,627 --> 01:21:48,652
And not as a last resort.

925
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:53,027
Well, that's... I mean,
that's just completely off the point.

926
01:21:53,200 --> 01:21:54,531
Harry.

927
01:21:55,002 --> 01:21:56,299
Where have you been?

928
01:21:56,470 --> 01:21:58,961
Never mind! Off to bed, both of you.

929
01:22:01,775 --> 01:22:05,802
- They get scary when they get older.
- Ron, you spoiled everything!

930
01:22:05,980 --> 01:22:07,845
What's this about?

931
01:22:12,119 --> 01:22:15,111
No, don't let

932
01:22:16,924 --> 01:22:21,258
This magic die

933
01:22:23,030 --> 01:22:25,794
The answer's there

934
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,217
Let me see it again.

935
01:23:27,528 --> 01:23:30,463
Yes, the time is close now.

936
01:23:35,135 --> 01:23:37,000
Harry, at last!

937
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:43,641
Step aside, Wormtail,
so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

938
01:23:54,254 --> 01:23:55,653
You all right, Harry?

939
01:23:57,091 --> 01:23:58,854
I just got in.

940
01:23:59,460 --> 01:24:00,688
Me.

941
01:24:11,972 --> 01:24:15,237
Harry, you told me
you'd figured the egg out weeks ago.

942
01:24:15,409 --> 01:24:19,607
- The task is two days from now.
- Really? I had no idea.

943
01:24:21,148 --> 01:24:22,945
I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

944
01:24:23,117 --> 01:24:25,950
Wouldn't know. We don't actually
talk about the tournament.

945
01:24:27,154 --> 01:24:31,750
Actually, we don't really talk at all.
Viktor's more of a physical being.

946
01:24:35,496 --> 01:24:38,693
I just mean he's not
particularly loquacious.

947
01:24:39,166 --> 01:24:41,396
Mostly, he watches me study.

948
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:44,295
It's a bit annoying, actually.

949
01:24:45,672 --> 01:24:48,368
You are trying to figure this egg out,
aren't you?

950
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,733
What's that supposed to mean?

951
01:24:51,311 --> 01:24:54,280
It just means these tasks
are designed to test you...

952
01:24:54,481 --> 01:24:57,644
...in the most brutal way.
They're almost cruel.

953
01:24:58,785 --> 01:25:00,412
And...

954
01:25:02,756 --> 01:25:04,656
...l'm scared for you.

955
01:25:05,592 --> 01:25:08,186
You got by the dragons mostly on nerve.

956
01:25:08,795 --> 01:25:11,286
I'm not sure it's going
to be enough this time.

957
01:25:11,465 --> 01:25:13,160
Hey, Potter!

958
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,396
- Potter!
- Cedric.

959
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,771
How...? How are you?

960
01:25:25,846 --> 01:25:27,245
Spectacular.

961
01:25:28,782 --> 01:25:32,616
I realize I never really thanked you properly
for tipping me off about those dragons.

962
01:25:32,786 --> 01:25:35,118
Forget it. I'm sure you
would've done the same for me.

963
01:25:35,422 --> 01:25:36,980
Exactly.

964
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:40,651
You know the Prefects' bathroom
on the fifth floor?

965
01:25:44,498 --> 01:25:47,092
It's not a bad place for a bath.

966
01:25:49,469 --> 01:25:51,369
Just take your egg...

967
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:54,835
...and mull things over
in the hot water.

968
01:26:30,043 --> 01:26:32,204
I must be out of my mind.

969
01:26:42,422 --> 01:26:44,583
I'm definitely out of my mind.

970
01:26:47,261 --> 01:26:50,526
I'd try putting it in the water
if I were you.

971
01:26:50,697 --> 01:26:52,597
Myrtle!

972
01:26:52,766 --> 01:26:54,495
Hello, Harry.

973
01:26:55,235 --> 01:26:58,500
Long time no see.

974
01:27:02,776 --> 01:27:06,439
I was circling a blocked drain
the other day...

975
01:27:06,613 --> 01:27:10,049
...and could swear I saw a bit
of Polyjuice Potion.

976
01:27:10,217 --> 01:27:12,549
Not being a bad boy again,
are you, Harry?

977
01:27:12,719 --> 01:27:14,482
Polyjuice Potion?

978
01:27:15,255 --> 01:27:19,282
Kicked the habit. Myrtle, did you say,
"Try putting it in the water"?

979
01:27:26,099 --> 01:27:27,794
That's what he did.

980
01:27:28,635 --> 01:27:30,296
The other boy...

981
01:27:31,705 --> 01:27:33,764
...the handsome one...

982
01:27:35,075 --> 01:27:36,303
...Cedric.

983
01:27:39,713 --> 01:27:42,375
Well, go on. Open it.

984
01:27:50,490 --> 01:27:55,484
Come seek us
Where our voices sound

985
01:27:55,662 --> 01:28:00,326
We cannot sing
Above the ground

986
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:04,869
An hour long you'll have to look

987
01:28:05,605 --> 01:28:10,269
To recover what we took

988
01:28:18,452 --> 01:28:19,680
Myrtle...

989
01:28:21,355 --> 01:28:24,791
...there aren't merpeople
in the Black Lake, are there?

990
01:28:25,692 --> 01:28:27,353
Very good.

991
01:28:28,228 --> 01:28:32,597
It took Cedric ages to riddle it out.

992
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:36,866
Almost all the bubbles were gone.

993
01:28:54,521 --> 01:28:56,489
Harry, tell me again.

994
01:28:58,191 --> 01:29:01,024
"Come seek us
where our voices sound."

995
01:29:01,194 --> 01:29:03,754
The Black Lake, that's obvious.

996
01:29:04,731 --> 01:29:07,256
"An hour long you'll have to look."

997
01:29:07,434 --> 01:29:10,892
Again, obvious. Though, admittedly,
potentially problematic.

998
01:29:12,272 --> 01:29:14,137
"Potentially problematic"?

999
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:17,572
When's the last time you held your breath
underwater for an hour, Hermione?

1000
01:29:18,111 --> 01:29:22,445
Look, Harry, we can do this.
The three of us can figure it out.

1001
01:29:22,616 --> 01:29:25,107
Hate to break up the skull session.

1002
01:29:25,285 --> 01:29:27,276
Professor McGonagall
wants you in her office.

1003
01:29:27,521 --> 01:29:29,921
Not you, Potter,
just Weasley and Granger.

1004
01:29:30,090 --> 01:29:32,752
But, sir, the second task
is only hours away, and...

1005
01:29:32,926 --> 01:29:35,520
Exactly. Presumably Potter
is well prepared by now...

1006
01:29:35,695 --> 01:29:37,560
...and could do with
a good night's sleep.

1007
01:29:37,731 --> 01:29:40,222
Go. Now!

1008
01:29:50,210 --> 01:29:52,007
Longbottom!

1009
01:29:52,179 --> 01:29:54,204
Why don't you help Potter
put his books back.

1010
01:30:02,856 --> 01:30:05,051
You know,
if you're interested in plants...

1011
01:30:05,225 --> 01:30:07,819
...you'd be better off with
Goshawk's Guide to Herbology.

1012
01:30:08,428 --> 01:30:12,762
Do you know there's a wizard in Nepal
who's growing gravity-resistant trees?

1013
01:30:12,933 --> 01:30:16,664
Neville, no offense,
but I really don't care...

1014
01:30:17,270 --> 01:30:18,999
...about plants.

1015
01:30:19,339 --> 01:30:21,034
Now, if there's...

1016
01:30:21,208 --> 01:30:26,009
...a Tibetan turnip that will allow me
to breathe underwater for an hour...

1017
01:30:26,179 --> 01:30:28,670
...then great. But otherwise...

1018
01:30:28,849 --> 01:30:32,649
I don't know about a turnip.
But you could always use gillyweed.

1019
01:30:33,820 --> 01:30:36,721
- Any bets? Any bets?
- Come on, place your bets!

1020
01:30:36,890 --> 01:30:38,357
Step up, mates! Don't be shy.

1021
01:30:38,525 --> 01:30:39,958
- Three lads.
- One lady.

1022
01:30:40,126 --> 01:30:42,287
- Four go down.
- But do four come up?

1023
01:30:42,462 --> 01:30:43,986
Don't be so mean.

1024
01:30:44,598 --> 01:30:46,429
- Any bets?
- Fleur's 10-1.

1025
01:30:48,602 --> 01:30:50,593
- You're sure about this, Neville?
- Absolutely.

1026
01:30:50,770 --> 01:30:52,704
- For an hour?
- Most likely.

1027
01:30:52,873 --> 01:30:54,363
Most likely?

1028
01:30:54,541 --> 01:30:56,736
Well, there is some debate
among herbologists...

1029
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:59,378
...as to the effects of fresh water
versus salt water...

1030
01:30:59,546 --> 01:31:02,208
You're telling me this now?
You must be joking!

1031
01:31:02,382 --> 01:31:04,350
I just wanted to help.

1032
01:31:04,518 --> 01:31:07,612
Well, that makes you a right sight
better than Ron and Hermione.

1033
01:31:07,787 --> 01:31:09,550
Where are they anyway?

1034
01:31:09,723 --> 01:31:12,749
- You seem a little tense, Harry.
- Do I?

1035
01:31:19,766 --> 01:31:21,996
Welcome to the second task.

1036
01:31:22,168 --> 01:31:25,865
Last night, something was stolen
from each of our champions.

1037
01:31:26,039 --> 01:31:27,404
A treasure of sorts.

1038
01:31:27,574 --> 01:31:30,202
These four treasures,
one for each champion...

1039
01:31:30,377 --> 01:31:33,073
...now lie on the bottom
of the Black Lake.

1040
01:31:33,246 --> 01:31:34,804
In order to win...

1041
01:31:34,981 --> 01:31:38,815
...each champion need only find
their treasure and return to the surface.

1042
01:31:38,985 --> 01:31:41,613
- Simple enough, except for this:
- Put that in your mouth.

1043
01:31:41,788 --> 01:31:45,417
They will have but one hour to do so,
and one hour only.

1044
01:31:45,592 --> 01:31:49,528
After that, they'll be on their own.
No magic will save them.

1045
01:31:49,996 --> 01:31:52,260
You may begin
at the sound of the cannon.

1046
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:21,727
- What's the matter with him?
- I don't know, I can't see him.

1047
01:32:23,063 --> 01:32:26,055
Oh, my God.
I've killed Harry Potter.

1048
01:32:27,901 --> 01:32:29,801
Yeah!

1049
01:32:30,971 --> 01:32:32,598
What?

1050
01:33:52,185 --> 01:33:54,312
The Beauxbatons champion,
Miss Delacour...

1051
01:33:54,487 --> 01:33:57,012
...has unfortunately
been forced to retire...

1052
01:33:57,657 --> 01:34:00,751
...so she will take no further part
in this task.

1053
01:35:18,538 --> 01:35:20,403
But she's my friend too!

1054
01:35:21,975 --> 01:35:23,704
Only one!

1055
01:36:15,061 --> 01:36:16,926
Let's get down below.

1056
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:29,773
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1057
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:29,029
Yes!

1058
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:49,212
Ascendio!

1059
01:37:54,460 --> 01:37:56,155
Harry!

1060
01:37:58,464 --> 01:37:59,931
He's all right.

1061
01:38:01,134 --> 01:38:02,567
He's all right. Barty!

1062
01:38:02,735 --> 01:38:06,171
- Go get him another towel.
- I want all the judges over here now!

1063
01:38:06,773 --> 01:38:10,265
You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save.

1064
01:38:10,910 --> 01:38:12,605
My little sister.

1065
01:38:13,012 --> 01:38:14,570
Thank you.

1066
01:38:15,381 --> 01:38:18,111
And you! You helped.

1067
01:38:18,751 --> 01:38:21,777
Well, yeah, a bit.

1068
01:38:28,995 --> 01:38:30,155
- Harry!
- Hermione!

1069
01:38:30,330 --> 01:38:32,992
Are you all right? You must be freezing.

1070
01:38:34,233 --> 01:38:36,167
Personally, I think you behaved admirably.

1071
01:38:36,336 --> 01:38:38,361
I finished last, Hermione.

1072
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:43,335
Next to last.
Fleur never got past the Grindylows.

1073
01:38:43,509 --> 01:38:46,740
Krum! Krum! Krum!

1074
01:38:46,913 --> 01:38:49,814
- Come on! Come on!
- Attention!

1075
01:38:52,151 --> 01:38:54,745
Attention!

1076
01:38:55,221 --> 01:38:59,089
The winner is Mr. Diggory...

1077
01:38:59,525 --> 01:39:03,017
...who showed innate command
of the Bubble-Head Charm.

1078
01:39:03,196 --> 01:39:05,858
However, seeing as Mr. Potter
would have finished first...

1079
01:39:06,032 --> 01:39:10,992
...had it not been for his determination
to rescue not only Mr. Weasley...

1080
01:39:11,170 --> 01:39:15,436
...but the others as well,
we've agreed to award him...

1081
01:39:15,608 --> 01:39:17,599
...second place...

1082
01:39:17,777 --> 01:39:19,267
- Second place!
- Well done!

1083
01:39:19,445 --> 01:39:22,073
...for outstanding moral fiber!

1084
01:39:23,349 --> 01:39:24,873
Yes!

1085
01:39:28,388 --> 01:39:30,185
- Right on.
- All that moral fiber, eh?

1086
01:39:30,356 --> 01:39:31,983
- It's great.
- Moral fiber?

1087
01:39:32,158 --> 01:39:34,524
Blimey. Even when you go wrong,
it turns out right.

1088
01:39:34,694 --> 01:39:37,356
- Yeah, well done, Moral Fiber.
- Congratulations, Potter.

1089
01:39:37,530 --> 01:39:39,191
- A fine achievement.
- Thank you.

1090
01:39:39,365 --> 01:39:40,889
Well done, boy.

1091
01:39:41,067 --> 01:39:44,298
- See you at Hagrid's, Harry.
- I'm sorry we haven't spoken.

1092
01:39:44,470 --> 01:39:48,463
After all, your story is one
I've heard so many times.

1093
01:39:49,475 --> 01:39:52,933
Quite remarkable, really.
Tragic, of course...

1094
01:39:53,112 --> 01:39:55,103
...to lose one's family.

1095
01:39:57,116 --> 01:39:59,277
Never whole again, are we?

1096
01:40:01,521 --> 01:40:03,614
Still, life goes on...

1097
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:05,951
...and here we stand.

1098
01:40:08,828 --> 01:40:11,558
I'm sure your parents would be
very proud of you today, Potter.

1099
01:40:11,731 --> 01:40:13,198
Bartemius!

1100
01:40:13,366 --> 01:40:17,496
Not trying to lure Potter into one of
the Ministry's summer internships, are we?

1101
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:20,867
The last boy who went into
the Department of Mysteries never came out!

1102
01:40:33,352 --> 01:40:35,252
And they say I'm mad.

1103
01:40:44,530 --> 01:40:48,261
Now, I remember...
I remember when I first met you all.

1104
01:40:48,434 --> 01:40:51,460
Biggest bunch of misfits
I ever set eyes on.

1105
01:40:51,971 --> 01:40:54,531
Suppose you remind me of meself a little.

1106
01:40:54,707 --> 01:40:58,734
- And here we all are, four years later.
- We're still a bunch of misfits.

1107
01:40:58,911 --> 01:41:02,244
Well, maybe,
but we've all got each other.

1108
01:41:02,415 --> 01:41:03,973
And Harry, of course.

1109
01:41:04,150 --> 01:41:09,520
Soon to be the youngest
Triwizard champion there's ever been!

1110
01:41:09,722 --> 01:41:11,747
Hooray!

1111
01:41:13,192 --> 01:41:15,683
Hogwarts, Hogwarts
Hoggy Warty Hogwarts

1112
01:41:15,862 --> 01:41:18,490
Teach us something, please

1113
01:41:28,474 --> 01:41:29,964
Mr. Crouch?

1114
01:41:37,049 --> 01:41:40,644
A man has died here, Fudge. And he
won't be the last. You must take action.

1115
01:41:40,820 --> 01:41:42,378
I will not.

1116
01:41:42,555 --> 01:41:46,616
In times like these, the wizard world looks
to its leaders for strength, Dumbledore!

1117
01:41:46,792 --> 01:41:48,123
Then for once show them some!

1118
01:41:48,294 --> 01:41:52,390
The Triwizard Tournament will not be
canceled. I will not be seen as a coward!

1119
01:41:52,565 --> 01:41:55,762
A true leader does what is right,
no matter what others think.

1120
01:41:55,935 --> 01:41:58,733
- What did you say to me?
- Excuse me, gentlemen.

1121
01:41:58,905 --> 01:42:02,568
It may interest you to know
this conversation is no longer private.

1122
01:42:06,913 --> 01:42:08,471
Oh, Harry!

1123
01:42:08,648 --> 01:42:10,946
Harry, how good to see you again.

1124
01:42:11,784 --> 01:42:13,308
I can come back later, professor.

1125
01:42:13,486 --> 01:42:16,819
Not necessary, Harry. The minister and I
are done. I'll be back in a moment.

1126
01:42:16,989 --> 01:42:19,549
Minister, after you.

1127
01:42:20,092 --> 01:42:22,083
There you are. Your hat.

1128
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:25,924
Oh, Harry, do feel free to indulge in
a little Licorice Snap in my absence.

1129
01:42:26,098 --> 01:42:29,329
But I have to warn you,
they're a wee bit sharp.

1130
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,352
Professor?

1131
01:44:02,528 --> 01:44:05,053
- Professor.
- Yeah.

1132
01:44:15,975 --> 01:44:19,741
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request...

1133
01:44:19,912 --> 01:44:21,846
...to present evidence to this council.

1134
01:44:22,014 --> 01:44:24,710
Should your testimony
prove consequential...

1135
01:44:24,884 --> 01:44:28,945
...council may be prepared
to order your immediate release.

1136
01:44:29,121 --> 01:44:33,717
Until such time, you remain in the eyes
of the Ministry a convicted Death Eater.

1137
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:35,588
Do you accept these terms?

1138
01:44:36,162 --> 01:44:38,858
- I do, sir.
- And what do you wish to present?

1139
01:44:39,198 --> 01:44:41,666
I have names, sir.

1140
01:44:42,201 --> 01:44:45,796
There was Rosier, Evan Rosier.

1141
01:44:48,474 --> 01:44:50,999
- Rosier is dead.
- He took a piece of me with him...

1142
01:44:51,177 --> 01:44:53,304
...though, didn't he?
- I didn't know.

1143
01:44:53,479 --> 01:44:56,107
- Lf that is all the witness has to offer...
- No, no, no.

1144
01:44:56,282 --> 01:44:59,581
There was Rookwood! He was a spy.

1145
01:44:59,752 --> 01:45:02,118
Augustus Rookwood?
Of the Department of Mysteries?

1146
01:45:02,288 --> 01:45:03,482
Yeah, the same.

1147
01:45:03,656 --> 01:45:07,319
He passed information to You-Know-Who
from inside the Ministry itself.

1148
01:45:08,561 --> 01:45:11,826
Very well. Council will deliberate.

1149
01:45:11,997 --> 01:45:13,965
In the meantime,
you will return to Azkaban.

1150
01:45:14,133 --> 01:45:18,866
No! Wait! Wait, please! Please, I have more!
What about Snape? Severus Snape?

1151
01:45:19,038 --> 01:45:22,007
As the council is aware,
I've given evidence on this matter.

1152
01:45:22,174 --> 01:45:26,133
Severus Snape was indeed a Death Eater
and, prior to Lord Voldemort's downfall...

1153
01:45:26,312 --> 01:45:29,304
...turned spy for us at great personal risk.
- It's a lie!

1154
01:45:29,482 --> 01:45:32,918
- Today he's no more a Death Eater than I am.
- Snape remains faithful to the Dark Lord!

1155
01:45:33,085 --> 01:45:35,383
Silence!

1156
01:45:35,988 --> 01:45:39,424
Unless the witness possesses
any genuine name of consequence...

1157
01:45:39,592 --> 01:45:41,719
...this session is now concluded.

1158
01:45:41,894 --> 01:45:43,987
Oh, no, no, no.

1159
01:45:44,897 --> 01:45:46,364
I've heard about one more.

1160
01:45:46,532 --> 01:45:49,092
- What's that?
- The name.

1161
01:45:49,268 --> 01:45:50,735
- Yes?
- I know for a fact...

1162
01:45:50,903 --> 01:45:52,928
...this person took part
in the capture...

1163
01:45:53,105 --> 01:45:55,266
...and, by means
of the Cruciatus Curse...

1164
01:45:55,441 --> 01:45:58,933
...torture of the Auror Frank Longbottom
and his wife!

1165
01:45:59,111 --> 01:46:01,443
The name.
Give me the wretched name!

1166
01:46:01,614 --> 01:46:04,139
Barty Crouch...

1167
01:46:06,852 --> 01:46:07,876
...Junior.

1168
01:46:17,363 --> 01:46:19,058
Hold him down!

1169
01:46:22,701 --> 01:46:26,330
Get your filthy hands off me,
you pathetic little men!

1170
01:46:28,040 --> 01:46:29,632
Hello, Father.

1171
01:46:31,043 --> 01:46:33,102
You are no son of mine.

1172
01:46:44,423 --> 01:46:48,883
Curiosity is not a sin, Harry.
But you should exercise caution.

1173
01:46:50,262 --> 01:46:51,661
It's a Pensieve.

1174
01:46:51,831 --> 01:46:56,495
Very useful if, like me,
you find your mind a wee bit stretched.

1175
01:46:56,669 --> 01:47:00,196
It allows me to see once more
things I've already seen.

1176
01:47:00,673 --> 01:47:03,642
You see, Harry, I have searched
and searched for something...

1177
01:47:03,809 --> 01:47:05,367
...some small detail...

1178
01:47:06,779 --> 01:47:08,906
...something I might have overlooked...

1179
01:47:09,081 --> 01:47:13,279
...something that would explain why
these terrible things have happened.

1180
01:47:14,086 --> 01:47:17,954
Every time I get close to an answer,
it slips away.

1181
01:47:19,024 --> 01:47:20,616
It's maddening.

1182
01:47:22,962 --> 01:47:24,725
Sir? Mr. Crouch's son.

1183
01:47:25,498 --> 01:47:27,557
What exactly happened to him?

1184
01:47:27,733 --> 01:47:32,534
He was sent to Azkaban.
Destroyed Barty to do it.

1185
01:47:33,205 --> 01:47:36,800
But he had no choice.
The evidence was overwhelming.

1186
01:47:38,277 --> 01:47:41,269
- Why do you ask?
- It's just that I...

1187
01:47:42,014 --> 01:47:44,107
I had a dream about him.

1188
01:47:46,385 --> 01:47:49,183
It was in the summer, before school.

1189
01:47:51,323 --> 01:47:54,315
In the dream, I was in a house.

1190
01:47:54,527 --> 01:47:59,294
And Voldemort was there,
only he wasn't quite human.

1191
01:47:59,465 --> 01:48:03,094
And Wormtail was there too.
And Mr. Crouch's son.

1192
01:48:03,469 --> 01:48:06,302
- Have there been others like this dream?
- Yes.

1193
01:48:07,139 --> 01:48:08,766
Always the same one.

1194
01:48:11,810 --> 01:48:14,142
Sir, these dreams...

1195
01:48:14,313 --> 01:48:19,512
...what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening, do you?

1196
01:48:21,153 --> 01:48:24,122
I think it's unwise for you
to linger over these dreams, Harry.

1197
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:26,591
I think it's best if you simply...

1198
01:48:32,231 --> 01:48:33,994
...cast them away.

1199
01:48:43,275 --> 01:48:47,234
It's a sign, Severus.
You know what it means as well as I.

1200
01:48:55,955 --> 01:48:57,149
Potter!

1201
01:48:57,323 --> 01:48:59,848
What's your hurry?

1202
01:49:04,964 --> 01:49:08,730
Congratulations, your performance
in the Black Lake was inspiring.

1203
01:49:08,901 --> 01:49:11,165
Gillyweed, am I correct?

1204
01:49:11,937 --> 01:49:13,461
Yes, sir.

1205
01:49:14,406 --> 01:49:15,805
Ingenious.

1206
01:49:17,643 --> 01:49:21,602
A rather rare herb, gillyweed.

1207
01:49:22,414 --> 01:49:25,906
Not something found
in your everyday garden.

1208
01:49:27,620 --> 01:49:29,554
Nor is this.

1209
01:49:33,759 --> 01:49:35,420
Know what it is?

1210
01:49:36,729 --> 01:49:38,162
Bubble juice, sir?

1211
01:49:38,731 --> 01:49:40,631
Veritaserum.

1212
01:49:41,367 --> 01:49:45,064
Three drops of this and You-Know-Who
himself would spill his darkest secrets.

1213
01:49:45,237 --> 01:49:50,402
The use of it on a student is,
regrettably, forbidden. However...

1214
01:49:51,076 --> 01:49:54,102
...should you ever steal
from my personal stores again...

1215
01:49:54,279 --> 01:49:59,148
...my hand might just slip over
your morning pumpkin juice.

1216
01:49:59,318 --> 01:50:03,721
- I haven't stolen anything.
- Don't lie to me.

1217
01:50:04,857 --> 01:50:10,557
Gillyweed may be innocuous,
but boomslang skin, lacewing flies?

1218
01:50:11,263 --> 01:50:14,596
You and your little friends are brewing
Polyjuice Potion, and believe me...

1219
01:50:14,767 --> 01:50:16,962
...l'm going to find out why!

1220
01:50:43,796 --> 01:50:45,388
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1221
01:51:04,583 --> 01:51:06,107
Sonorus!

1222
01:51:10,355 --> 01:51:15,691
Earlier today, Professor Moody placed
the Triwizard Cup deep within the maze.

1223
01:51:15,861 --> 01:51:20,821
Only he knows its exact position.
Now, as Mr. Diggory...

1224
01:51:22,935 --> 01:51:24,732
...and Mr. Potter...

1225
01:51:26,605 --> 01:51:28,334
...are tied for first position...

1226
01:51:28,507 --> 01:51:32,637
...they will be the first to enter the maze,
followed by Mr. Krum...

1227
01:51:33,879 --> 01:51:37,337
...and Miss Delacour.
- Come on! Krum! Krum! Krum!

1228
01:51:38,217 --> 01:51:41,311
The first person to touch the cup
will be the winner!

1229
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:48,387
I've instructed the staff
to patrol the perimeter.

1230
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:51,495
Should, at any point, a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task...

1231
01:51:51,663 --> 01:51:56,157
...he or she need only send up
red sparks with their wands.

1232
01:51:56,502 --> 01:52:00,404
Contestants! Gather around. Quickly!

1233
01:52:03,542 --> 01:52:07,876
In the maze, you'll find no dragons
or creatures of the deep.

1234
01:52:08,046 --> 01:52:11,413
Instead, you'll face something
even more challenging.

1235
01:52:11,583 --> 01:52:14,609
You see, people change in the maze.

1236
01:52:14,787 --> 01:52:16,482
Oh, find the cup if you can.

1237
01:52:16,655 --> 01:52:21,422
But be very wary, you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

1238
01:52:22,895 --> 01:52:25,887
Champions, prepare yourselves!

1239
01:52:34,940 --> 01:52:36,407
Good luck.

1240
01:52:36,809 --> 01:52:38,743
- My boy.
- See you later, Dad.

1241
01:52:41,113 --> 01:52:43,707
On the count of three. One...

1242
01:56:11,490 --> 01:56:12,718
Fleur?

1243
01:56:14,393 --> 01:56:15,826
Fleur.

1244
01:56:19,398 --> 01:56:21,229
Periculum!

1245
01:56:59,905 --> 01:57:01,372
Get down!

1246
01:57:01,940 --> 01:57:03,669
Get down!

1247
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:05,537
Expelliarmus!

1248
01:57:15,153 --> 01:57:18,350
No, don't! Stop!
He's bewitched, Cedric!

1249
01:57:18,523 --> 01:57:20,582
- Get off me!
- He's bewitched!

1250
01:57:32,204 --> 01:57:33,899
Yes.

1251
01:57:54,793 --> 01:57:56,556
Harry!

1252
01:57:58,864 --> 01:58:00,525
Harry!

1253
01:58:02,901 --> 01:58:04,334
Harry!

1254
01:58:06,805 --> 01:58:08,363
Harry!

1255
01:58:10,342 --> 01:58:12,139
Reducto!

1256
01:58:28,927 --> 01:58:31,418
- Thanks.
- No problem.

1257
01:58:31,830 --> 01:58:36,529
You know, for a moment there,
I thought you were gonna let it get me.

1258
01:58:36,701 --> 01:58:38,430
For a moment, so did I.

1259
01:58:40,305 --> 01:58:41,465
Some game, huh?

1260
01:58:42,507 --> 01:58:43,906
Some game.

1261
01:58:49,347 --> 01:58:50,974
Go!

1262
01:59:01,126 --> 01:59:04,152
Go on, take it.
You saved me, take it!

1263
01:59:04,329 --> 01:59:06,320
- Together. One, two...
- Two...

1264
01:59:06,498 --> 01:59:07,726
...three!
...three!

1265
01:59:20,178 --> 01:59:23,113
- You okay?
- Yeah. You?

1266
01:59:30,188 --> 01:59:31,519
Where are we?

1267
01:59:37,229 --> 01:59:38,856
I've been here before.

1268
01:59:42,500 --> 01:59:44,092
It's a Portkey.

1269
01:59:45,870 --> 01:59:50,136
- Harry, the cup is a Portkey.
- I've been here before, in a dream.

1270
01:59:52,210 --> 01:59:55,611
Cedric! We have to get back
to the cup. Now!

1271
01:59:55,780 --> 01:59:57,748
What are you talking about?

1272
02:00:02,988 --> 02:00:05,889
- Harry! What is it?
- Get back to the cup!

1273
02:00:13,531 --> 02:00:15,863
- Who are you? What do you want?
- Kill the spare.

1274
02:00:16,034 --> 02:00:18,798
- Avada Kedavra!
- No! Cedric!

1275
02:00:30,115 --> 02:00:31,980
Do it! Now!

1276
02:00:43,928 --> 02:00:46,419
Bone of the father...

1277
02:00:46,598 --> 02:00:48,896
...unwillingly given.

1278
02:00:56,374 --> 02:00:59,400
Flesh of the servant...

1279
02:01:01,446 --> 02:01:04,609
...willingly sacrificed.

1280
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:12,451
And blood of the enemy...

1281
02:01:18,263 --> 02:01:20,754
...forcibly taken.

1282
02:01:26,805 --> 02:01:29,774
The Dark Lord shall rise...

1283
02:01:30,542 --> 02:01:32,476
...again.

1284
02:02:35,874 --> 02:02:39,275
My wand, Wormtail.

1285
02:02:48,820 --> 02:02:50,788
Hold out your arm.

1286
02:02:50,955 --> 02:02:52,547
Master.

1287
02:02:52,724 --> 02:02:55,352
Thank you, master.

1288
02:02:55,527 --> 02:02:56,994
The other arm, Wormtail.

1289
02:03:37,635 --> 02:03:39,535
Welcome, my friends.

1290
02:03:40,939 --> 02:03:43,703
Thirteen years it's been, and yet...

1291
02:03:44,342 --> 02:03:49,837
...here you stand before me
as though it were only yesterday.

1292
02:03:50,782 --> 02:03:53,717
I confess myself...

1293
02:03:54,185 --> 02:03:55,743
...disappointed.

1294
02:03:56,421 --> 02:03:58,514
Not one of you tried to find me.

1295
02:03:58,690 --> 02:04:02,057
Crabbe! Macnair!

1296
02:04:02,961 --> 02:04:04,292
Goyle!

1297
02:04:06,798 --> 02:04:08,425
Not even you...

1298
02:04:12,303 --> 02:04:14,237
...Lucius.

1299
02:04:16,074 --> 02:04:20,909
My Lord, had I detected any sign,
a whisper of your whereabouts...

1300
02:04:21,079 --> 02:04:24,071
There were signs, my slippery friend.
And more than whispers.

1301
02:04:24,249 --> 02:04:29,414
I assure you, my Lord,
I have never renounced the old ways.

1302
02:04:31,122 --> 02:04:36,754
The face I have been obliged to present
each day since your absence...

1303
02:04:38,763 --> 02:04:41,391
...that is my true mask.

1304
02:04:41,766 --> 02:04:43,324
I returned.

1305
02:04:45,803 --> 02:04:49,705
Out of fear, not loyalty.

1306
02:04:50,842 --> 02:04:56,610
Still, you have proved yourself useful
these past few months, Wormtail.

1307
02:05:01,819 --> 02:05:04,151
Thank you, master.

1308
02:05:04,756 --> 02:05:06,485
Thank you.

1309
02:05:09,594 --> 02:05:11,960
- Such a handsome boy.
- Don't touch him!

1310
02:05:13,431 --> 02:05:14,921
Harry.

1311
02:05:15,099 --> 02:05:17,897
I'd almost forgotten you were here.

1312
02:05:18,069 --> 02:05:22,472
Standing on the bones
of my father. Yeah.

1313
02:05:22,640 --> 02:05:24,005
I'd introduce you...

1314
02:05:24,175 --> 02:05:28,475
...but word has it you're almost
as famous as me these days.

1315
02:05:31,149 --> 02:05:33,811
The boy who lived.

1316
02:05:33,985 --> 02:05:36,886
How lies have fed your legend, Harry.

1317
02:05:37,055 --> 02:05:41,048
Shall I reveal what really happened
that night 13 years ago?

1318
02:05:41,225 --> 02:05:45,958
Shall I divulge how
I truly lost my powers?

1319
02:05:46,130 --> 02:05:47,722
Yes, shall I?

1320
02:05:48,066 --> 02:05:49,397
It was love.

1321
02:05:49,567 --> 02:05:54,061
You see, when dear, sweet Lily Potter
gave her life for her only son...

1322
02:05:54,238 --> 02:05:56,832
...she provided the ultimate protection.

1323
02:05:57,241 --> 02:05:59,038
I could not touch him.

1324
02:06:00,278 --> 02:06:02,405
It was old magic.

1325
02:06:02,580 --> 02:06:04,844
Something I should have foreseen.

1326
02:06:05,016 --> 02:06:06,813
But no matter, no matter.

1327
02:06:06,985 --> 02:06:09,180
Things have changed.

1328
02:06:09,954 --> 02:06:13,446
I can touch you...

1329
02:06:14,058 --> 02:06:15,787
...now.

1330
02:06:23,935 --> 02:06:25,266
Yeah.

1331
02:06:31,609 --> 02:06:35,306
Astonishing what a few drops
of your blood will do, eh, Harry?

1332
02:06:36,447 --> 02:06:38,176
Pick up your wand, Potter.

1333
02:06:39,784 --> 02:06:42,014
I said, pick it up! Get up! Get up!

1334
02:06:43,588 --> 02:06:45,920
You've been taught how to duel,
I presume, yes?

1335
02:06:46,090 --> 02:06:48,524
First, we bow to each other.

1336
02:06:48,693 --> 02:06:51,059
Come on, now, Harry.
The niceties must be observed.

1337
02:06:51,229 --> 02:06:54,460
Dumbledore wouldn't want you
to forget your manners, would he?

1338
02:06:54,632 --> 02:06:55,963
I said, bow.

1339
02:06:57,835 --> 02:07:02,169
- That's better. And now...
- No.

1340
02:07:02,573 --> 02:07:04,438
Crucio!

1341
02:07:06,911 --> 02:07:08,640
Crucio!

1342
02:07:09,714 --> 02:07:11,648
Attaboy, Harry.

1343
02:07:11,816 --> 02:07:13,943
Your parents would be proud.

1344
02:07:14,252 --> 02:07:17,653
Especially your filthy Muggle mother.

1345
02:07:17,822 --> 02:07:19,414
Expelliar...

1346
02:07:22,427 --> 02:07:24,827
I'm going to kill you, Harry Potter.

1347
02:07:24,996 --> 02:07:26,987
I'm going to destroy you.

1348
02:07:29,200 --> 02:07:34,763
After tonight, no one will ever again
question my powers.

1349
02:07:35,406 --> 02:07:37,966
After tonight, if they speak of you...

1350
02:07:38,142 --> 02:07:40,804
...they'll speak only of how you...

1351
02:07:41,112 --> 02:07:42,943
...begged for death.

1352
02:07:43,114 --> 02:07:46,880
And I, being a merciful Lord...

1353
02:07:47,418 --> 02:07:49,010
...obliged.

1354
02:07:49,353 --> 02:07:50,843
Get up!

1355
02:07:55,860 --> 02:07:57,828
Don't you turn your back on me,
Harry Potter!

1356
02:07:57,995 --> 02:08:00,259
I want you to look at me
when I kill you!

1357
02:08:00,431 --> 02:08:03,628
I want to see the light
leave your eyes!

1358
02:08:17,582 --> 02:08:19,311
Have it your way.

1359
02:08:20,351 --> 02:08:22,751
- Expelliarmus!
- Avada Kedavra!

1360
02:08:40,271 --> 02:08:42,933
Do nothing! He's mine to finish!

1361
02:08:47,512 --> 02:08:49,207
He's mine!

1362
02:09:22,280 --> 02:09:26,273
Harry, when the connection is broken,
you must get to the Portkey.

1363
02:09:26,450 --> 02:09:28,509
We can linger for a moment
to give you some time...

1364
02:09:28,686 --> 02:09:30,449
...but only a moment.
Do you understand?

1365
02:09:31,656 --> 02:09:34,682
Harry, take my body back, will you?

1366
02:09:34,859 --> 02:09:37,384
Take my body back to my father.

1367
02:09:38,429 --> 02:09:39,760
Let go.

1368
02:09:40,231 --> 02:09:42,199
Sweetheart, you're ready.

1369
02:09:43,034 --> 02:09:45,662
Let go! Let go!

1370
02:09:51,409 --> 02:09:52,774
Accio!

1371
02:09:58,482 --> 02:10:00,473
No!

1372
02:10:13,231 --> 02:10:14,823
He did it!

1373
02:10:16,067 --> 02:10:17,728
Harry!

1374
02:10:20,504 --> 02:10:21,994
Harry!

1375
02:10:23,207 --> 02:10:26,438
No! No! No, don't!

1376
02:10:26,744 --> 02:10:28,609
For God's sake, Dumbledore,
what's happened?

1377
02:10:28,913 --> 02:10:31,473
He's back. He's back.

1378
02:10:31,649 --> 02:10:33,674
Voldemort's back.

1379
02:10:33,851 --> 02:10:36,251
Cedric, he asked me
to bring his body back.

1380
02:10:36,420 --> 02:10:38,752
I couldn't leave him, not there.

1381
02:10:38,923 --> 02:10:41,721
It's all right, Harry. It's all right.

1382
02:10:41,893 --> 02:10:44,191
He's home. You both are.

1383
02:10:44,362 --> 02:10:47,991
Keep everybody in their seats.
A boy has just been killed.

1384
02:10:51,068 --> 02:10:54,731
The body must be moved, Dumbledore.
There are too many people.

1385
02:10:55,006 --> 02:10:56,701
Let me through.

1386
02:10:56,874 --> 02:10:58,398
Let me through!

1387
02:11:00,311 --> 02:11:01,573
Let me through!

1388
02:11:01,746 --> 02:11:03,145
That's my son!

1389
02:11:04,448 --> 02:11:05,881
That's my boy!

1390
02:11:08,719 --> 02:11:11,449
It's my boy!

1391
02:11:14,258 --> 02:11:17,819
- Come on. Get up. Easy, easy!
- No.

1392
02:11:17,995 --> 02:11:20,964
This is not where you want to be
right now. Come on.

1393
02:11:21,632 --> 02:11:23,827
No!

1394
02:11:26,904 --> 02:11:29,304
It's all right, I got you.

1395
02:11:29,473 --> 02:11:32,806
I got you. Come on. Easy, now.

1396
02:11:36,814 --> 02:11:38,611
No!

1397
02:11:39,717 --> 02:11:41,582
No!

1398
02:12:23,995 --> 02:12:25,690
Are you all right, Potter?

1399
02:12:26,263 --> 02:12:28,197
Does it hurt? That?

1400
02:12:28,366 --> 02:12:30,163
Not so much now.

1401
02:12:31,102 --> 02:12:33,195
Perhaps I'd better take a look at it.

1402
02:12:36,340 --> 02:12:38,331
The cup was a Portkey.

1403
02:12:41,045 --> 02:12:42,876
Someone had bewitched it.

1404
02:12:43,147 --> 02:12:45,240
What was it like?

1405
02:12:45,583 --> 02:12:47,244
- What was he like?
- Who?

1406
02:12:47,418 --> 02:12:49,181
The Dark Lord.

1407
02:12:51,489 --> 02:12:54,583
What was it like
to stand in his presence?

1408
02:12:55,860 --> 02:12:57,657
I don't know.

1409
02:13:00,498 --> 02:13:03,433
It was like I'd fallen
into one of my dreams...

1410
02:13:06,404 --> 02:13:08,395
...into one of my nightmares.

1411
02:13:27,124 --> 02:13:28,682
Were there others?

1412
02:13:28,859 --> 02:13:31,123
In the graveyard, were there others?

1413
02:13:35,066 --> 02:13:36,465
I...

1414
02:13:37,168 --> 02:13:41,104
I don't think I said anything
about a graveyard, professor.

1415
02:13:48,546 --> 02:13:51,811
"Marvelous creatures, dragons,
aren't they?"

1416
02:13:56,220 --> 02:13:59,280
Did you think that miserable oaf
would've led you into the woods...

1417
02:13:59,457 --> 02:14:01,357
...if I hadn't suggested it?

1418
02:14:04,895 --> 02:14:08,592
Do you think Cedric Diggory would've
told you to open the egg underwater...

1419
02:14:08,766 --> 02:14:11,257
...if I hadn't told him first myself?

1420
02:14:12,870 --> 02:14:15,532
Did you think Neville Longbottom,
the witless wonder...

1421
02:14:15,706 --> 02:14:18,903
...could've provided you with gillyweed
if I hadn't given him the book...

1422
02:14:19,076 --> 02:14:20,634
...that led him straight to it?

1423
02:14:29,053 --> 02:14:33,046
It was you from the beginning.
You put my name in the Goblet of Fire.

1424
02:14:33,624 --> 02:14:37,253
- You bewitched Krum, but you...
- "But... But..."

1425
02:14:37,428 --> 02:14:39,589
You won because I made it so, Potter.

1426
02:14:40,231 --> 02:14:43,723
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so.

1427
02:14:43,901 --> 02:14:45,198
And now the deed is done.

1428
02:14:46,871 --> 02:14:51,205
The blood that runs through these veins
runs within the Dark Lord.

1429
02:14:59,717 --> 02:15:03,209
Imagine how he will reward me
when he learns...

1430
02:15:04,155 --> 02:15:06,646
...that I have once and for all...

1431
02:15:07,258 --> 02:15:11,592
...silenced the great Harry Potter.

1432
02:15:11,762 --> 02:15:13,024
Expelliarmus!

1433
02:15:17,735 --> 02:15:18,997
Severus.

1434
02:15:21,472 --> 02:15:22,962
That's it, take it.

1435
02:15:24,942 --> 02:15:28,400
- Do you know who I am?
- Albus Dumbledore.

1436
02:15:28,579 --> 02:15:31,275
- Are you Alastor Moody? Are you?
- No.

1437
02:15:31,448 --> 02:15:34,542
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?

1438
02:15:37,588 --> 02:15:39,112
Harry, away from there!

1439
02:16:00,110 --> 02:16:03,443
- You all right, Alastor?
- I'm sorry, Albus.

1440
02:16:04,415 --> 02:16:06,474
That's Moody. But then who's...?

1441
02:16:08,285 --> 02:16:09,377
Polyjuice Potion.

1442
02:16:09,553 --> 02:16:12,784
Now we know who's been stealing
from your stores, Severus.

1443
02:16:13,023 --> 02:16:14,957
We'll get you up in a minute.

1444
02:16:49,393 --> 02:16:50,792
Harry!

1445
02:16:54,465 --> 02:16:56,660
Barty Crouch Junior.

1446
02:16:56,900 --> 02:16:59,835
I'll show you mine
if you show me yours.

1447
02:17:02,206 --> 02:17:03,400
Your arm, Harry.

1448
02:17:07,778 --> 02:17:10,008
You know what this means, don't you?

1449
02:17:10,914 --> 02:17:12,245
He's back.

1450
02:17:13,450 --> 02:17:15,577
Lord Voldemort has returned.

1451
02:17:16,520 --> 02:17:18,852
I'm sorry, sir. I couldn't help it.

1452
02:17:19,056 --> 02:17:23,584
Send an owl to Azkaban. I think
they'll find they're missing a prisoner.

1453
02:17:24,061 --> 02:17:26,552
- I'll be welcomed back like a hero.
- Perhaps.

1454
02:17:27,131 --> 02:17:29,998
Personally, I've never had much time
for heroes.

1455
02:17:49,887 --> 02:17:52,549
Today, we acknowledge...

1456
02:17:53,257 --> 02:17:56,021
...a really terrible loss.

1457
02:17:58,128 --> 02:18:00,892
Cedric Diggory was, as you all know...

1458
02:18:01,065 --> 02:18:03,397
...exceptionally hard-working...

1459
02:18:04,301 --> 02:18:06,667
...infinitely fair-minded...

1460
02:18:07,237 --> 02:18:09,535
...and, most importantly...

1461
02:18:09,840 --> 02:18:14,402
...a fierce, fierce friend.

1462
02:18:15,546 --> 02:18:19,915
Now, I think, therefore, you have
the right to know exactly how he died.

1463
02:18:22,953 --> 02:18:24,477
You see...

1464
02:18:25,322 --> 02:18:27,415
...Cedric Diggory was murdered...

1465
02:18:28,325 --> 02:18:30,316
...by Lord Voldemort!

1466
02:18:32,229 --> 02:18:35,790
The Ministry of Magic
does not wish me to tell you this.

1467
02:18:36,433 --> 02:18:40,130
But not to do so, I think,
would be an insult to his memory.

1468
02:18:42,306 --> 02:18:43,967
Now, the pain...

1469
02:18:44,141 --> 02:18:47,804
...we all feel at this dreadful loss
reminds me...

1470
02:18:47,978 --> 02:18:49,309
...and reminds us...

1471
02:18:49,480 --> 02:18:53,177
...that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues...

1472
02:18:53,350 --> 02:18:56,786
...our hearts beat as one.

1473
02:18:57,287 --> 02:18:59,312
In light of recent events...

1474
02:18:59,656 --> 02:19:04,593
...the bonds of friendship we've made
this year will be more important than ever.

1475
02:19:05,462 --> 02:19:10,798
Remember that, and Cedric Diggory
will not have died in vain.

1476
02:19:11,235 --> 02:19:13,362
You remember that...

1477
02:19:13,971 --> 02:19:16,997
...and we'll celebrate a boy who was...

1478
02:19:17,541 --> 02:19:20,009
...kind and honest...

1479
02:19:20,511 --> 02:19:25,107
...and brave and true,
right to the very end.

1480
02:19:50,340 --> 02:19:52,365
I never liked these curtains.

1481
02:19:52,976 --> 02:19:55,638
Set them on fire in my fourth year.

1482
02:19:55,979 --> 02:19:57,810
By accident, of course.

1483
02:20:03,487 --> 02:20:07,856
I put you in terrible danger
this year, Harry. I'm sorry.

1484
02:20:11,261 --> 02:20:12,956
Professor...

1485
02:20:13,163 --> 02:20:16,155
...when I was in the graveyard,
there was a moment...

1486
02:20:16,967 --> 02:20:21,370
...when Voldemort's wand and mine
sort of connected.

1487
02:20:22,940 --> 02:20:25,272
Priori Incantatem.

1488
02:20:29,413 --> 02:20:32,143
You saw your parents that night,
didn't you?

1489
02:20:32,716 --> 02:20:34,547
They reappeared.

1490
02:20:36,019 --> 02:20:39,785
No spell can reawaken the dead, Harry.
I trust you know that.

1491
02:20:42,359 --> 02:20:44,953
Dark and difficult times lie ahead.

1492
02:20:45,429 --> 02:20:50,264
Soon we must all face the choice
between what is right and what is easy.

1493
02:20:53,637 --> 02:20:55,298
But remember this:

1494
02:20:55,472 --> 02:20:57,406
You have friends here.

1495
02:20:59,409 --> 02:21:01,172
You're not alone.

1496
02:21:21,865 --> 02:21:23,594
Hermione.

1497
02:21:24,001 --> 02:21:25,992
This is for you.

1498
02:21:26,603 --> 02:21:28,798
Write to me. Promise.

1499
02:21:29,907 --> 02:21:31,306
Bye.

1500
02:21:37,548 --> 02:21:39,482
Au revoir, Ron.

1501
02:22:23,427 --> 02:22:25,952
Do you think we'll ever just have
a quiet year at Hogwarts?

1502
02:22:26,129 --> 02:22:27,255
- No.
- No.

1503
02:22:27,431 --> 02:22:31,800
No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.
What's life without a few dragons?

1504
02:22:36,206 --> 02:22:39,039
Everything's going to change now,
isn't it?

1505
02:22:46,350 --> 02:22:47,817
Yes.

1506
02:22:52,556 --> 02:22:55,855
Promise you'll write this summer.
Both of you.

1507
02:22:56,026 --> 02:22:58,586
I won't. You know I won't.

1508
02:22:59,863 --> 02:23:03,629
- Harry will, won't you?
- Yeah. Every week.
