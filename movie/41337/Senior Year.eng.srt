It's always been my dad's dream. Now
I'm going to end up at his alma mater.

Did I just say that?

My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.

And you're already in. That's so cool.

162

Except she won't stop talking
about it. It's embarrassing.

I'm proud of you.

The thing about Stanford
is it's a thousand and fifty...

...fifty-three miles from here.

I know.

168
00:10:20,922 --> 00:10:24,449
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.

Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

# I'd wish this moment
was ours to own it

We'll be right down, Mom.

Good morning, Ms. Evans. I'm Tiara Gold.

235
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,651
I transferred
to East High from London

236
00:15:28,729 --> 00:15:32,028
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.

237
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:35,001
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

238
00:15:35,069 --> 00:15:38,163
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

239
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,731
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

- That's a theater term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

241
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:49,276
It's best to keep
science and math books together,

242
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:51,841
since those are
first lessons of the day.

simply to make certain

I'd have your nonfat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

- Organic.

morning so that our outfits won't clash.

00:20:11,512 --> 00:20:14,276
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.

316
00:20:14,348 --> 00:20:15,838
Miss Darbus, exactly...

317
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:18,612
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

318
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,176
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

319
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:25,919
Now, I have
some very important news from...

320
00:20:27,428 --> 00:20:30,795
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,

321
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:34,595
America's preeminent college
for the performing arts.

322
00:20:34,668 --> 00:20:38,195
And for the first time
in East High history,

323
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:41,605
Juilliard is considering four of you

324
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:44,405
for one available scholarship.

325
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:47,504
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.

326
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:50,607
- Mr. Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

327
00:20:50,684 --> 00:20:53,915
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

328
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,511
They certainly did.

329
00:20:55,589 --> 00:21:00,026
And, lastly, Mr. Troy Bolton.

330
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,220
What?

331
00:21:02,296 --> 00:21:07,233
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

332
00:21:09,403 --> 00:21:14,170
So good luck to our four applicants.

333
00:21:14,241 --> 00:21:17,506
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.

334
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,407
So... who's the big comedian?

335
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:26,579
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.

336
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:31,181
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr. Bolton,

337
00:21:31,258 --> 00:21:35,058
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

338
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:38,894
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

339
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:43,369
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

340
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,200
Line up, downstage, please.

341
00:21:48,775 --> 00:21:52,438
Let's begin with Mr. Danforth.
Step forward, please.

342
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,409
Your future.

343
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:58,610
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.

344
00:21:58,685 --> 00:22:02,485
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

345
00:22:02,556 --> 00:22:05,457
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.

346
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,550
Oh.

347
00:22:06,627 --> 00:22:09,118
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.

348
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:12,127
Martha Cox, you're late.

349
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:15,532
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

350
00:22:19,106 --> 00:22:21,939
[Group gasps, chuckles]

351
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:24,910
I feel a show coming on already!

352
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:34,620
Mr. Bolton.

353
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:37,982
- Mr. Bolton.
- Hmm?

354
00:22:38,058 --> 00:22:41,118
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah, uh...

355
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:47,598
You know... uh...

356
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:49,192
I've been thinking about...

357
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,867
Uh...

358
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:59,401
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

359
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:03,245
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

360
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:06,218
Gosh, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

361
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:09,413
But I know where it ends.

362
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,081
Center stage.

363
00:23:12,593 --> 00:23:14,254
A single spotlight.

364
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:20,190
A huge marquee that reads...

365
00:23:33,947 --> 00:23:35,710
New York deli platter, please.

366
00:23:35,782 --> 00:23:39,343
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?

367
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,013
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

368
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,580
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

369
00:23:47,227 --> 00:23:50,685
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.

370
00:23:50,764 --> 00:23:53,756
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

371
00:23:53,834 --> 00:23:56,359
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

372
00:23:56,436 --> 00:24:00,031
The theater fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?

373
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:04,134
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

374
00:24:04,211 --> 00:24:07,009
- Aren't we performers?
- Exactly.

375
00:24:08,415 --> 00:24:10,007
- Hmm.

- Of course they are. Thank you.

00:48:24,503 --> 00:48:27,404
- This better be good.
- They select only 30 freshmen

784
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:32,240
from the entire incoming class. It's
a special three-weeks Honor program.

- Her missing the show

is a little disappointing, but being
selected for Stanford's Honors Program,

1011
01:04:30,340 --> 01:04:32,900
that is amazing for her
and for East High.

that she's on the fence about it.

Your Honors Program at Stanford...

All right, everyone!
Attention, please! Listen up.

1107
01:11:06,536 --> 01:11:10,973
As some of you know, Miss Montez
is no longer available to us.

1108
01:11:11,041 --> 01:11:13,805
However, the show must indeed go on.

1109

So, Sharpay, you will do
Gabriella's duet with Troy.

- Don't worry. Kelsi will work with you.
- Hmm.

1113

Come on, people. Let's rise to
the occasion. We're all pros here.

1114
01:11:32,562 --> 01:11:34,928
Let's do it for Gabriella. OK?

1115
01:11:34,998 --> 01:11:37,831
Kelsi, Troy, Ryan. Play piano.

1116

All right, we have a lot of work to do.

1117
01:11:41,271 --> 01:11:45,207
There are sets to paint.
Drill that second number. Let's go!

1118
01:11:45,275 --> 01:11:47,106
Come on people, double time!

1119

- Yeah.

1122
01:12:18,141 --> 01:12:19,130
Yeah.

1123
01:12:20,443 --> 01:12:23,469
She's knee-deep in geniuses out there.

1124
01:12:23,547 --> 01:12:26,573
Believe it or not, she says
the food's better at East High.

1125
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:29,380
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1126
01:12:29,452 --> 01:12:31,044
She still coming down for prom?

1127
01:12:32,122 --> 01:12:33,214
Yeah.

1128
01:12:39,195 --> 01:12:41,095
How's that big show going?

1129
01:12:41,164 --> 01:12:42,495
You don't want to know.

1130
01:12:48,305 --> 01:12:50,796
When were you going
to tell me about this?

1131
01:12:52,242 --> 01:12:53,334
Juilliard.

1132
01:12:56,346 --> 01:12:57,677
There's nothing to tell.

1133
01:12:59,015 --> 01:13:00,642
Maybe there is.

1134
01:13:00,717 --> 01:13:04,414
I heard you're talking to other schools.
I mean, is this serious?

1135
01:13:04,487 --> 01:13:07,888
U of A isn't the only school
that's talked to me. You know that.

1136
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:10,358
But it's the only school
we talked about.

1137
01:13:10,427 --> 01:13:13,055
Chad would be disappointed
if you changed your mind.

1138
01:13:13,129 --> 01:13:14,824
No, Chad would get over it.

1139

Would you?

1140
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:21,963
We've been going to U of A games
since you were a little kid.

1141
01:13:22,038 --> 01:13:24,632
You talked about wearing
a Redhawks uniform.

1142
01:13:24,708 --> 01:13:27,768
But I'm not a little kid anymore.

1143

You raised me to make my own choices
and I need to make them.

01:22:50,907 --> 01:22:54,365
- Is she going to miss prom?
- No, she's not coming back at all.

1257
01:22:56,445 --> 01:22:59,744
Wow. That's lousy, man.

1258
01:23:01,651 --> 01:23:02,743
It really is.

1259
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:05,112
But, hey, man.

1260
01:23:06,923 --> 01:23:10,222
Everybody knows you don't bring
the girl with you after high school.

1261
01:23:11,627 --> 01:23:16,223
Look, Gabriella is already
one step ahead. As usual.

1262
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:21,132
Right now you got
to snap out of it, dude.

1263
01:23:21,204 --> 01:23:25,573
She's off to Stanford.
And, look, I am right there with you.

1264
01:23:25,641 --> 01:23:30,340
Taylor's heading to Yale.
And you and me are going to U of A.

1265
01:23:32,548 --> 01:23:33,845
It's a new ball game.

1266
01:23:38,854 --> 01:23:41,652
Maybe I don't see my life
as a ball game anymore, man.

1267
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:44,883
Look.

1268
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:49,721
You're gonna go to the prom with us,
be with your friends.

1269
01:23:49,799 --> 01:23:53,200
You're gonna have
a good time. All right?

1270
01:23:53,269 --> 01:23:56,727
I don't plan on missing my prom.

1271
01:23:56,806 --> 01:23:58,137
There we go.

1272
01:24:28,471 --> 01:24:31,304
I figured you'd be the last one
out of the building.

1273
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,144
I don't believe this.

1274
01:24:36,212 --> 01:24:38,180
I took a wrong turn on the way to prom.

1275
01:24:39,615 --> 01:24:41,810
So did you.

1276
01:24:41,884 --> 01:24:47,322
You are so crazy, Wildcat.
And what is it with you and trees?

1277
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,881
I guess I see things
more clearly from up here.

1278
01:24:50,893 --> 01:24:53,293
You look handsome.

1279
01:24:53,362 --> 01:24:57,423
Prom is tonight in Albuquerque.
It's a thousand miles away.

1280
01:25:02,071 --> 01:25:04,164
My prom is wherever you are.

1281
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:10,371
If I'm going to have a last dance
at East High, it's going to be with you.

You know... I'm not the only one
that changed when you came to East High.

1302
01:27:15,004 --> 01:27:19,805
Kids that I used to just pass
in the hallway... we're friends now.

1303
01:27:19,875 --> 01:27:22,275
And we're supposed to
be doing a show together.

1304
01:27:24,613 --> 01:27:27,844
The problem is, East High
changed when you got there.

1305
01:27:27,917 --> 01:27:30,408
And now it's changed again
because you left.

1306
01:27:34,690 --> 01:27:38,217
You might be ready
to say goodbye to East High,

1307
01:27:38,294 --> 01:27:41,286
but East High's not ready
to say goodbye to you.

What are you? A Muppet gangster?

Oh. What is that? Is that
your cologne or a toxic spill?

Oh, yeah. It's called "Babe Magnet."

the Drama Department.

has a decision to make.

Mr. Troy Bolton. Troy.

I've chosen basketball.

1520
01:42:10,532 --> 01:42:12,591
But I've also chosen theater.

1521
01:42:20,608 --> 01:42:24,635
The University of California,
Berkeley, offers me both.

1522

That's where I'm going
to be attending next fall.

1523

But most of all, I choose the
person who inspires my heart.

1524
01:42:36,124 --> 01:42:42,029
Which is why I picked
a school that's exactly 32.7...

East High is a place where teachers
encouraged us to break the status quo.

1548
01:44:50,258 --> 01:44:52,988

we'll keep for the rest of our lives.

we really are all in this together.
