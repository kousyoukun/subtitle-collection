4
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,664
 <i> It's 54,000 square kilometres</i>
    <i> of brutal insurgency,</i>

5
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,599
     <i> conflicting agendas,</i>

 <i> It's one hell of a rough road.</i>

10
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,471
        - Checking dope,

11
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,840

 Hold left hand side of target.

15
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:07,252
             - On.

16
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:11,723
   And buddy's got a shovel.

17
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:14,793
      - Could be a farmer.
          - On a road?

18
00:03:14,795 --> 00:03:17,629
           - Why not?
   - 'Cause it's a road, man.

19
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,699
   - Could be a really shitty
    farmer, like, constantly
       puzzled, you know?

20
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:23,902
     He's in the village,
    asking everybody, "Why
    are my crops so lousy?"

21
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:27,239
  No one has the heart to say,
  "Hey, buddy, you can't grow,

22
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:30,742
   like, anything on a road."

23

  - Will you shut the fuck up?

24
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,916
           Bad move.

00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,144
 - Take a look at that culvert.

52
00:06:52,146 --> 00:06:55,847
       Cover the stretch of road
    50 meters to... to the left.

53
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,918
  Three One Charlie, this is 66.

      I say again, do not
        crest the hill.

56
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:11,730
   We've got something weird
    on the road. Gonna have
       a look. Wait out.

57
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,116

  on the patch just ten meters

58

      left of the culvert.
       Put a round in it.

00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:58,243
           - Hickey, put a round
        in the patch next to it.

61
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,196
        - Could be just
     a bad patch of road.
 - Yeah, what if you're wrong?

62
00:08:18,198 --> 00:08:20,599
- When have I
ever been wrong?

63
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:23,235
         - My sister?

                 We got an Elder
        with crazy eyes, he's...

133
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:05,670
  he's asking us inside. I'm
 moving in. We'll strong point
       from there. Over.

134
00:15:05,672 --> 00:15:09,574
   - Did he say 'crazy eyes'?
            - Yeah.

135
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,510
   - Can I get a description
         of the Elder?
      - 66, this is Zero.

136
00:15:12,512 --> 00:15:16,281
- 66. Did you not hear me?
  We need QRF extraction now!

137
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:20,518
- It's important.
describe
      the friendly. Over.

138
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,022
     - 66. Elder is about--

139
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:28,092
  I don't know, he's Afghan old.
  Weird eyes, different colours.

140
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,995
      - Break Break. Zero,
      they're jammed here,
     we gotta get them out!

141
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,031

  we're pushing. Will advise.

142
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:35,967
            - Fuck!

143
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:42,407

    Come on. Let's move in.

144
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,409
          - I got it.

            - Clear!
            - Clear!

146

   - Everybody take a corner.

147
00:15:52,418 --> 00:15:55,653
 Three Niner Alpha, 66. Looking
 for status on that ride home?

148
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:57,689
    - 66, Three Niner Alpha.

149
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:01,259
   QRF is two-zero mikes out
    and you're danger close
        for artillery.

150
00:16:01,261 --> 00:16:03,261
  You're gonna have to hunker
      down. We'll get you
      out of there ASAP.

151
00:16:03,263 --> 00:16:06,297
       - 66, roger. Out.
       We're on our own.

152
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:08,299
     - What, they can't get
        anything to us?
       - Not for a while.

153
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:12,103
   Okay, guys, let's arm up.

154
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,422
        - What the fuck?

155
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:44,102
  - Grenade. I need a grenade.
       - I got one. Here.

156
00:16:58,283 --> 00:17:01,119
   - Ryan. What do you think
        they're doing?

157
00:17:01,121 --> 00:17:03,187
  - Same as us, getting ready.

158
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:16,401
      - You see anything?
 - They got an '82 recoilless.

159
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:18,603
- Oh, great.

160
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:34,685

            - Good.
            - Yeah.

161
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:37,422

       - What's he doing?

162
00:17:37,424 --> 00:17:39,824
        - I don't know.

163
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,801
- They killed him.

164
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:55,273
- Gents, it's been a privilege.
          - Likewise.

165
00:17:55,275 --> 00:17:59,410
 - Kill every fucker that comes
      through those doors.
         - Roger that.

166
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:11,456

         - No Taliban.

169
00:18:24,804 --> 00:18:26,804

170
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,873

171
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:35,379
           Let's go!

172
00:18:41,688 --> 00:18:44,689
           Thank you.
            - Clear!

173
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:54,765

174

I'm building a big fucking road

200
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:01,492
  into the heart of the enemy
   and it is fucking him up.

And every morning
he wakes up,

202
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,863
          and I'm standing there
            and I'm punching him

00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,774

   'cause we're fucking with
   their freedom of movement.

206
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:20,278
So they're going after our dump
 trucks and our gravel trucks
       and our workers.

207
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,314
     - What are you saying?
          - I'm saying

208
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:26,851
     I've lost 36 civilians
  in the last four months and
  this bullshit's got to stop.

209
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:29,453
 And I'm going to need a little
         help from you.
           - General,

210
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,024
      I am just one man--
- You're Bashir Daoud Khan, BDK.

211
00:21:33,026 --> 00:21:34,925
 You're one man with a militia.

212
00:21:37,529 --> 00:21:39,497
- And I'm your partner in peace.

213
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,767
     - So I need your eyes
         and your ears

214
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,935
         and I need you
       and your son to be

215
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:47,705
    at our little dedication
   ceremony-- how many clicks
         there, Shorty?

216
00:21:47,707 --> 00:21:51,676
        - Fifteen, sir.
      - Fifteen clicks of
     hardtop into the Horn.

217
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:55,079
      Your presence there
   would be very meaningful.

218
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,723
                    - Hyena Road
                       is a gift

219
00:22:05,725 --> 00:22:08,926
                 to all Afghans.
           It would be an honour

220
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:12,063
             for my father and I
        to attend your ceremony.

221
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:16,734
    - Out-fucking-standing.

222
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:22,840
     - Thank you, General.
       - Thank you, sir.

223
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,088
    - Look at that little prick.
             He's like Caligula.

224
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:41,826
It'd be a hell of a lot easier
to get Hyena built if that prick
would stop breathing.

225
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:44,628
- Yeah, right there
you're right. Look,
I'm gonna hop a flight.

226
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,897
I wanna get out to Sper and
run down a lead on an Elder.

227
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,934
        Tell Armstrong
  I'll call in from the FOB.
- You don't wanna hang with me?

228
00:22:49,936 --> 00:22:52,737
- Oh, you know there is
nothing I'd rather do,

229
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:56,874
but the future of Western
civilization depends on my ass
getting out to Sper.

00:24:04,444 --> 00:24:06,644

  <i> to each other all the time.</i>

234
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:08,813
  <i> And one day he got a letter</i>
<i>from her saying, "What the hell?</i>

235
00:24:08,815 --> 00:24:11,949
<i>"You conquered most of the known</i>

00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:54,859

<i>the dirt all around the palace.</i>

241
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:58,262
 <i> Later that night a couple of</i>
 <i> attendants showed up, to make</i>
    <i> sure she was alright.</i>

242
00:24:58,264 --> 00:25:00,698
 <i> One says, go ahead, after you.</i>

243
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,968
   <i> And the other one says,</i>
   <i> no, after you. And the</i>
     <i> first one says, no,</i>

244
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,971
  <i> I insist. And the second one</i>
   <i> says, don't you tell me</i>
         <i> what to do,</i>

245
00:25:06,973 --> 00:25:09,106
<i>and they both pull their swords</i>
      <i> and they go at it</i>

246
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:11,175
  <i> until they kill each other.</i>

247
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,078
 <i> Alexander's mother watched all</i>
    <i> this and wrote a note</i>

   <i> okay, okay, now I get it.</i>

249
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:21,051
<i>And he wrote back, saying, yeah,</i>
   <i> even the dirt is hostile.</i>

250

<i>In Afghanistan, dogs fight dogs,</i>

     - Mind if I join you?
 - Not at all, Warrant, please.

254
00:25:57,989 --> 00:26:01,091
      Hey, I got an update
       from the Engineer

255
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:05,029
on that stretch of Hyena
from yesterday. They
cleared 8 IEDs in all.

256
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:08,299

00:26:08,301 --> 00:26:12,670
They airlifted him to Landstuhl.

258
00:26:12,672 --> 00:26:15,072
    I think we need to talk.
          - Hey, uh...

259
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:18,943
  Hi, Jenn, sorry to interrupt
 here. Ryan, I'm Pete Mitchell,
    one of the effects guys

260
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:23,347
at Brigade. Didn't mean to wreck
   your meal, but you mind if
    I have a word with you?

261
00:26:23,349 --> 00:26:25,282
            - Sure.

262
00:26:25,284 --> 00:26:29,053
     Catch up to you later.

263
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:39,763
- I was in the TOC when you guys
             had that engagement
                   in Haji Baba.

264
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:44,602
         You were fucking lucky.

265
00:26:44,604 --> 00:26:48,639
  - Come all the way out here
       to tell me that?
             - No.

266
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:51,342
             No, I came out here
                      because...

267
00:26:51,344 --> 00:26:54,011
  and I could be way out of line
             here but, you know,

268
00:26:54,013 --> 00:26:56,347
     manifestly you and Jenn got
       a little something going.

269
00:26:56,349 --> 00:27:00,184
  On behalf of the entire battle
 group, I'd just like to express

270
00:27:00,186 --> 00:27:03,687
our collective fuckin' jealousy.

271
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,023
- You got a girl?

272
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:09,760
                 - Yep. Woman of
            my dreams back home.

273
00:27:09,762 --> 00:27:12,630
  - Does she know what you do?
           - My wife?

274
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,399
           No, she thinks I work
                 inside the wire

275
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:18,836
       and I'm going to leave it
         that way. Let her sleep
                  easy at night.

276
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:24,708
       Tell me something.

277
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:27,845
    How much you do you know
       about Pashtunwali?

278
00:27:27,847 --> 00:27:30,848
     - Well, whatever's in
    the handbook. You know,

279
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:34,018
 it's a tribal code. It's old.
          - Oh yeah.

280
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,389
It's so old they look upon Islam
as a kind of recent add-on.

281
00:27:38,391 --> 00:27:41,358
               - What are those?

282
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,661
- They're dates.
They're local.

283
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,764
They help you shit.

284
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,203
    The code has got a bunch of,
   well, they call them pillars,

285
00:27:53,205 --> 00:27:56,206
                      and one of
                  them is Panah,

286
00:27:56,208 --> 00:27:58,742
       which means 'protection',
                   more or less.

287
00:27:58,744 --> 00:28:01,311
  So when that Elder invited you
into his home he gave you Panah:

288
00:28:01,313 --> 00:28:03,847
   no harm could come to you.

289
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:08,352
   - So I owe him, you mean?
       - Well, he did it

290
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:12,189
  for Allah, he didn't do it for
you. But you are still breathing
         so that'd be your call.

291
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:18,362
                     This Elder,

292
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,198
       did he speak any English?

293
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,401
- No.
Just a couple words.

294
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,705
     - Any marks about him,
           any scars?
             - No,

295
00:28:27,707 --> 00:28:30,040
     but he had weird eyes.
          - Weird how?

296
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,943
       - His left eye was brown.
    His right eye was deep blue.

297
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:38,849
So who is this guy?

298
00:28:38,851 --> 00:28:41,819
Why'd he... why'd he
give me this Panah?

299
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:44,855
                   - That's what
                 I want to know.

300
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:47,891
  I got a patrol going back into
     the village in the morning.

301
00:28:47,893 --> 00:28:51,395
              I'd really like it
             if you'd come along
    with me, help me ID the guy.

302
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:55,099
  - Yeah, sure, I'll be there.
            - O900.

303
00:28:55,101 --> 00:28:57,167
           - Alright.
           - Alright.

304
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:59,937
 - I'll see you in the morning.
            - Yeah.

305
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,447
    - What are you thinking?

306
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:46,216
            - Hmm...

307
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:49,219
  I'm thinking about our hotel
        room in Cyprus.

308
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,295
            - Umm...

309
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:03,100
 Okay, I'm gonna say something

310
00:30:03,102 --> 00:30:06,069
and I'm gonna say it for both of
 us and it's going to be shitty

311
00:30:06,071 --> 00:30:08,806
    and it's got to be said.

312
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,844
           - Fuck me.

313
00:30:13,846 --> 00:30:17,481
- You know that I am completely
crazy about you.
And Cyprus was...

314
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,087
Cyprus was perfect.

315
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,927
We're perfect. But we can't keep
doing this. We both know that.

316
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:32,162
If we get caught,

317
00:30:32,164 --> 00:30:36,133
    I'm gonna get cashiered.
       This is my career.
       - It's mine, too.

318
00:30:36,135 --> 00:30:40,137
- I know, this is what I'm
saying. When we rotate home,

319
00:30:40,139 --> 00:30:43,507
we'll see. But right now, while
we're here, it's gotta stop.

320
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,348
                - So this is it?

321
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:54,184
- I think it has to be.

322
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,927
                  - This is like
             fucking Armageddon.

323
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:06,263
           - I know.

324
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:11,268
   You know there is nothing
    that I would rather do

325
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:14,571
   than climb over there and
fraternize the shit out of you.

326
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:17,341
            - Hmm...

327
00:31:19,344 --> 00:31:21,445
               You can't dump me
                 in one sentence

328
00:31:21,447 --> 00:31:26,016
               and say something
          like that in the next.

329
00:31:31,155 --> 00:31:33,891
                           Ah...

330
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,198
- Now, when you get to the grape
    fields, if you see wire,

331
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,936
 you see metal, you see plastic
     or newly turned dirt?

332
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:22,139
Don't step on it. If you didn't
  drop it, don't pick it up.

333
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:26,176
 Try to stay at least five body
  lengths between the next man
         in the patrol.

334
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:29,646
  When we get in the village,
   you're going to see women
       dressed in bags.

335
00:32:29,648 --> 00:32:33,951
 Please don't stare at them. I
 know you've probably seen that
      in Toronto or Paris,

336
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:38,121
 but you haven't seen it here.
   Here, those bags are like
    magnets for your eyes.

337
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:42,326
   If you get caught staring
      at them, it's gonna
     fuck shit up for us.

338
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:46,630
    Quick clot, Tourniquet,

339
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,433
           bandage.
      - I don't know how
      to use any of that.

340
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:53,637
  - Ma'am, if it has to be used,
       it won't be you using it.

341
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,219
        Salaam Alaikum.

342
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:47,357
Hey! Eyes.

343
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:54,698
       - Salaam Alaikum.
       - Alaikum Salaam.

344
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,667
       - This is my PTM.

345
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:01,104
In my job, it is a great honour
      to meet Elders such
      as yourself today.

346
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,173
            And if you chose so,
               it is a good day.

347
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:06,643
        But I was hoping to meet
  another elder in this village?

348
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:22,759
- He insists that "I'm the only
elder and there is no other".

349
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,762
- Strange, because someone
told me there was another

350
00:34:25,764 --> 00:34:28,498
 important man who lived in this
 village, but I forget his name.

351
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:32,836
        But this person said you
  couldn't forget him because he
had two different coloured eyes.

352
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:51,788
- Hey! Hey. What's in your head?
        You're too high.

353
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,591
 You can see the women without
their bags. Get down. Get down!

354
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:58,195
         - Sorry, sir.
 - I think you know who I mean.

355
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:03,200
    - He says he's a ghost.
   - Even ghosts have to live
           somewhere.

356
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:15,612
- He says most of them
live in Kandahar City.

357
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:37,300
     - Haji, what the fuck
         are you doing?
    - The carpets are dusty.

358
00:35:37,302 --> 00:35:40,504
- The entire country is dusty.

359
00:35:40,506 --> 00:35:42,472
 Come on, let's have some tea.

360
00:35:42,474 --> 00:35:45,609
      Step into my office.
   - How are you doing, Pete?

361
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:47,811
      How is your family?
       How is your time?

362
00:35:47,813 --> 00:35:51,148
   - It's good. How is yours?

363
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,683
   Have you heard from Kabul?
     When will you see 'em?

364
00:35:53,685 --> 00:35:57,254
      - Soon. Insha Allah.

365
00:35:57,256 --> 00:35:58,889
- You're frowning.

366
00:36:01,225 --> 00:36:04,327
 - I thought you were crazy, but
         I was wrong and I don't
               like to be wrong.

367
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,596
                  My cousin says
                maybe it is him.

368
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:10,233
         - In K-City?
- He thinks so. Why is he back?

369
00:36:10,235 --> 00:36:14,704
      - If it's even him.
        - But the eyes?

370
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:19,442
- If it is him, do you think
you can get me in to see him?

371
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,778
      - My uncle has arranged it
                   for tomorrow.

372
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,314
- Tell him I'm gonna
bring along another guy,

373
00:36:24,316 --> 00:36:27,384
       the Master Sniper
     with the battle group.
       - One other thing.

374
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:30,820
     It's not relational--
          - Related.
        - Related, yes.

375
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:33,223
           I'm hearing something
                about an attack.

376
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:35,926
          - In K-City?
   - Soon. That's all I know.

377
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:37,961
     As soon as I find out more,
                I will tell you.

378
00:36:37,963 --> 00:36:40,497
    - Okay.

379
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,966
How are you?
You need anything?

380
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:46,236
        - No, I'm good.
 - You always say you're good.

381
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:49,940
- I'm Afghan.

382
00:36:49,942 --> 00:36:52,742
- Oh listen, I got you...

383
00:36:52,744 --> 00:36:56,479
I got you some of that shampoo.
            - What?

384
00:36:56,481 --> 00:37:00,217
- Some of that hand cream
you guys are so crazy about.

385
00:37:03,488 --> 00:37:06,389
  - Thank you, this is great.
  - You're welcome, my friend.

386
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,960
- This is my favourite.

387
00:37:09,962 --> 00:37:13,263
   - Guys, listen up. This is
 straight from the brass. Guys!

388
00:37:13,265 --> 00:37:16,833
   Listen. Alright... No more
    fraternizing with goats!

389
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,336
   You bunch of goat-fuckers.

390
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:23,240
- Okay, listen up. All four dets
are out tonight, All Ops
are observe and report,

391
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,942
except for you, Travis. You guys
are on that bend in Hyena

392
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,477
where that fucking tree is,
so keep your eyes peeled.

393
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:33,950
  I've been seconded to intel
  for the day so I'm heading
         into K-City.

394
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:35,952
 Wilf here is going to step up.

395
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,622
- Nice. Wilf!

396
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:42,392
                - Alright, I got
                  some bad news.

397
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:45,996
 They grabbed a couple of guys
from 10th Mountain Dog Company.

398
00:37:45,998 --> 00:37:48,765
            - What?
- Yeah. I don't know the details

399
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,767
      but there was an IED
         of some sort,

400
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,902
        and the Tallies
      grabbed two of them.

401
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,973
       - Are they alive?
            - Yeah.

402
00:38:02,346 --> 00:38:04,748
            - Fuck!

403
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,719
You can blow me up with an IED,

404
00:38:09,721 --> 00:38:14,357
  shoot me with an AK, fucking
    run me over with a LAV--

405
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:20,697
  I'm fucking fine with that!
  But do not let me be taken
       alive by these...

406
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:24,301
     fucking medievalists.

407
00:38:24,303 --> 00:38:26,736
- You good?

408
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:31,908
        - What exactly
      do they do to you?
      - It's unspeakable.

409
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:35,779
- New comm logs. Fill them out.
     - What do you mean--
            - Hey.

410
00:38:35,781 --> 00:38:38,815
   Unspeakable means we don't
    fucking speak about it.

411
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:02,639
        - Targets down.

412
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,874
         Let's back up.

413
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,856
       First time, Wilf,
       how do you feel?
            - Good.

414
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:23,827
         - Ready to go?
        - No, not quite.
      I gotta take a shit.

415
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,030
          - What? Why?
   - Why, I don't know, maybe
   'cause my lower intestine

416
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:29,032
                is full of shit?
               Give me your bag.

417
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:31,868
        - Alright, fine.
           - Thanks.

418
00:39:37,842 --> 00:39:40,443
     - What a beautiful night...

419
00:39:40,445 --> 00:39:44,514
You know, if they get this place
        together, I'd come back.

420
00:39:44,516 --> 00:39:46,916
      Bring Joey camping.
          - Camping.

421
00:39:46,918 --> 00:39:48,918
            - Yeah.
         - In Kandahar?

422
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:51,821
      - Why the fuck not?

423
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,924
- Number two totally offloaded.

424
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:58,528
          Good to go.

425
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:02,065
      - Three Niner Alpha,

426
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,935
    this is 66 Bravo. Ready
     for extraction. Over.

427
00:40:06,971 --> 00:40:09,072
         - Let's move.

428
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:30,093
  - It's a beautiful morning.
   - Has been for two hours.

429
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:34,631
   How long until the convoy?
    - Should be on the move,
    five, ten mikes, maybe.

430
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:38,802
     - These A&A Dudes...
     You trust these guys?

431
00:40:38,804 --> 00:40:41,604
- With my life.

432
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:44,073
        It's their war.
 We're just along for the ride.

433
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:46,075
         Hey, Walid...

434
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:49,979
            - Huh?
        - What's he got
      going on the tunes?

435
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:57,487
        - Leif Garrett.
 - You're shitting me. Come on,
  put it out for all to hear.

436
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:01,124
            - Yeah?
        - ¶¶ Playin' in
     a rock and roll band ¶

437
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:05,762
  ¶ I never had no problems ¶

438
00:41:05,764 --> 00:41:10,099
         ¶ Burnin' down
       one night stands ¶

439
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:14,170
       ¶ And everything
       around me, yeah ¶

440
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:17,941
 ¶ Got to stop feelin' so low ¶

441
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:21,211
   ¶ And I decided quickly ¶

442
00:41:21,213 --> 00:41:23,746
         ¶ Yes I did ¶

443
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:27,584
        ¶ To disco down
    and check out the show ¶

444
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:30,119
       ¶ Yeah they were
     dancin' and singin' ¶

445
00:41:30,121 --> 00:41:33,022
 ¶ And movin' to the groovin' ¶

446
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:37,060
   ¶ And just when it hit me
    somebody turned around
         and shouted ¶

447
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:40,563
    ¶ Play that funky music
          white boy ¶

448
00:41:40,565 --> 00:41:44,901
¶ Play that funky music right ¶

449
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:49,939
    ¶ Play that funky music
          white boy ¶

450
00:41:49,941 --> 00:41:52,642
    ¶ Lay down that boogie ¶
        - Okay, cowboys,

451
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,677
     on the move. Mount up.

452
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,814
   - ¶ Play that funky music
 till you die, till you die ¶¶

453
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,834
     - Gulf Niner Whiskey,
    we're falling in. Over.

454
00:43:11,355 --> 00:43:13,756
    - We'll take this right.

455
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:20,797
 - This is Gulf Niner Whiskey,
      we're breaking off.
      Thanks for the tow.

456
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,132
     - Pete, anywhere here.

457
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:35,211
       - Who is that guy?
   - He's called The Cleaner.

458
00:43:35,213 --> 00:43:38,681
 He's the bravest man I've ever
 known. My greatest ally here.

459
00:43:38,683 --> 00:43:41,384
  He works for us but can't be
   seen with us, if you know
          what I mean.

460
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:43,620
   His family's up in Kabul,

461
00:43:43,622 --> 00:43:46,222
    and he hasn't seen them
    or slept in the same bed

462
00:43:46,224 --> 00:43:48,691
 more than three nights running
     in the last two years.

463
00:43:48,693 --> 00:43:51,761
     - Why is he doing it?

464
00:43:51,763 --> 00:43:54,831
              - Love of country?
          I honestly don't know.

465
00:43:54,833 --> 00:43:57,934
               Can't just be for
           the money we pay him.

466
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:55,291
       - Salaam Alaikum.
       - Alaikum Salaam.

467
00:45:24,354 --> 00:45:26,355
              - He says his name
                    is Mohammed.

468
00:45:26,357 --> 00:45:30,860
        - Yeah, of course it is.
     This bread looks very good.

469
00:45:34,498 --> 00:45:38,334
       My friend, Ryan.
     We have been friends,

470
00:45:38,336 --> 00:45:42,739
we have known each other
and loved each other
for many, many years.

471
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,408
        And you helped my friend
    in the village of Haji Baba.

472
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,084
And I would like to repay you
for that kindness.

473
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:57,053
    Now you must need something?

474
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,322
         Perhaps new prayer rugs
                for your mosque.

475
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:02,125
 I would like to help with that.

476
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,433
      - How much is that?
       - I have no idea.

477
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:12,969
   This is for your village.

478
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:32,822
- He says, "Only a fool accepts
    a gift without knowing
        what it's for."

479
00:46:37,327 --> 00:46:40,296
- There was a legendary warrior,
       a Mujahedeen in the Jihad

480
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,132
     against the Soviets. He was
called 'The Lion of the Desert'.

481
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:58,214
            - He says he's heard
                    of this man.

482
00:46:58,216 --> 00:47:02,585
   - The word is that he's back.
        He's once again mujahid.

483
00:47:02,587 --> 00:47:05,321
         Have you heard anything
            about these rumours?

484
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,435
    May I ask where you're from?

485
00:47:26,476 --> 00:47:30,880
     - He says his village
    is called Abdullah Jan.
   - Ah, so you're Pakistani?

486
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,929
        - "I've been a Pakistani
                 for many years,

487
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:49,565
a Muslim for fourteen hundred
and a Pashtun for five
thousand."

488
00:47:49,567 --> 00:47:50,967
                 - I understand.

489
00:47:55,505 --> 00:47:58,274
            If you hear anything
                 about the Lion,

490
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:00,476
                 I would greatly
                  appreciate it.

491
00:48:18,528 --> 00:48:22,098
      - So he's Pakistani?
             - No.

492
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,001
       No, that was just
        a kind of test.

493
00:48:25,003 --> 00:48:28,571
     Abdullah Jan is just
   the ruins of some village

494
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,274
       across the border
       from Spin Boldak.

495
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:34,977
  Nobody's really lived there
  for a couple hundred years,
       least of all him.

496
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:39,348
  - So he's not just some guy
        from a village.
        - No, he's not.

497
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,684
  He's the Lion of the Desert.

498
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:44,020
     That's what his people
          called him.

499
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:53,095
 The Russians, they called him
    The Ghost because they
      couldn't kill him.

500
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,999
   They shot him four times,
    they blew him up twice.

501
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:59,268
         And each time,

502
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,472
 his guys would get him up over
 the mountains and into the Red
    Cross tents in Pakistan.

503
00:49:03,474 --> 00:49:05,942
Then they'd get him stitched up

504
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:09,145
   and he'd be back out there
blowing Russians out of the sky.

505
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,551
  We just met a very big gun.

506
00:49:15,553 --> 00:49:18,454
              He's like a Rommel
                    or a Patton.

507
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:22,959
 This guy beat the Red Army, and
    he was a kid when he did it.

508
00:49:22,961 --> 00:49:25,361
               When the Russians
                     pulled out,

509
00:49:25,363 --> 00:49:28,631
I'm going back to my grape
                         fields,

510
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:31,133
           I don't want any part
       of your stupid civil war.

511
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,102
            Just leave me alone.

512
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,671
Which they did,
and it was kinda weird

513
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:37,640
because generally speaking,

514
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:40,676
  the Tallies went after anybody
who stood against them. But him,

515
00:49:40,678 --> 00:49:43,412
       for some reason they just
                 left him alone.

516
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:47,650
      - But now he's back.
          - He's back,

517
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:51,354
and I gotta figure out why.
A guy like him, with his
influence? He could prob--

518
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:13,075
  - We have multiple bombers,
 vehicle borne and coordinated.
 Reporting civilian casualties,

519
00:50:13,077 --> 00:50:17,146
multiple CIV-KIA, city center--
   - Got a VD-IED Southwest
        Kandahar City.

520
00:50:17,148 --> 00:50:20,116
      Multiple casualties.
  - In AIR reports taking fire

521
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:22,084
       at route one and
       alpha seven-five.

522
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:26,455
        - Must have hit
       the engine block.
          - Goddamn.

523
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:30,359
 - Peter, where is the convoy?
      We lost the convoy!

524
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:36,732
- Zero, Golf Niner Whiskey.
-      I have contact. Over.

525
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,701
  - Yeah, Golf Niner Whiskey.
        We have contact

526
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:48,144
 - Zero, roger. Be advised we
have reports of multiple SBVIED

527
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:50,413
     in vicinity of Police
 Headquarters. More to follow.

528
00:50:50,415 --> 00:50:52,615
Golf Niner Whiskey, send.

529
00:50:54,752 --> 00:50:58,421
I advise you, try and exit city,
   move to Camp Nathan Smith,
       ride this one out.

530
00:50:58,423 --> 00:51:01,824
- Golf Niner Whiskey. Wilco out.
   There's another explosion.
           Let's go.

531
00:51:01,826 --> 00:51:04,627
   We're gonna have to move,
          head north.

532
00:51:04,629 --> 00:51:08,397
Goddamn, I can't get the radio--
 - Forget the radio! We'll use
           my MBITER.

533
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:11,801
   Let's go. We got to move.

534
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:21,577
     - Fuck. I'm gonna have
          to blow it.
            - Walid?

535
00:51:21,579 --> 00:51:24,380
            - Yeah.
      - Come... come here.
        Behind the car.

536
00:51:27,717 --> 00:51:30,086
          - Frag out.

537
00:51:36,193 --> 00:51:38,494
- Mitchell, grab Walid.
Punch up to that corner,

538
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:41,697
          cover my 6.
     - Roger. Stay with me.

539
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,568
            - Clear.

540
00:51:45,570 --> 00:51:49,205
            - Dick.

541
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:55,377
          - Let's go.

542
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,382
         They're moving
    on the fucking rooftops.

543
00:52:04,688 --> 00:52:06,755
        Clear. Let's go.

544
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,294
              RPG!

545
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:19,401
           You good?
         - Yeah, good.

546
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:25,374
       - Can you shoot?
   - Me? Fuck no. I'm intel.

547
00:52:28,211 --> 00:52:31,180
  - Zero, Golf Niner Whiskey.
I have PID on multiple hostiles,

548
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:34,150
40 meters east of last position.
      Engaging. Wait out.

549
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:37,620
         - Zero, roger.
           - Moving.
          - Covering.

550
00:52:47,931 --> 00:52:50,432
     - Target, one o'clock!

551
00:52:58,742 --> 00:53:01,277
     Target down! Mitchell,
         come up to me.

552
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:03,646
          - Move it.
         - Go, go, go!

553
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:08,617
           - Hold up!

554
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:10,686
- I need you to punch left.

555
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,557
      Down that alleyway.
   I'll cover you. You good?
      - Yeah, good to go.

556
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,593
           - Standby.

557
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:20,629
              Go!

558
00:53:30,807 --> 00:53:33,676
            - Clear!

559
00:53:33,678 --> 00:53:36,645
            - Clear.

560
00:53:36,647 --> 00:53:40,416
         - This is bad.

561
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:44,587
    - You piss with the dick
       you got. Move it.

562
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:56,465
    Changing mags. Cover me.
          - Covering.

563
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:01,337
           - Moving.

564
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:09,545
     - Rooftop, 9 o'clock.

565
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:23,926
             Clear.

566
00:54:39,309 --> 00:54:42,411
         - Shoot him.
     - I don't shoot kids.

567
00:54:54,758 --> 00:54:56,859
            - Clear.
            - Clear.

568
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:07,636
  - No, no. It's my guy. It's
   my guy. It's The Cleaner.
        Go, go, go, go.

569
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:25,354
    Haji, where did you get
          this truck?

570
00:55:25,356 --> 00:55:28,490
          - My uncle!
          - Of course.

571
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:30,559
- I hung around, you never know
       about this city.

572
00:55:30,561 --> 00:55:33,996
   I heard the gunfire. Came
 looking for you. We got lucky!

573
00:55:37,902 --> 00:55:41,937
  - Zero acknowledge. Goddamn.

574
00:55:49,412 --> 00:55:51,880
     - Can you get that in
         to Armstrong?

575
00:55:51,882 --> 00:55:54,717
Ho, ho, ho. That was balls out,

576
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,919
   flat-out fucking insanity.

577
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,455
Five suicide bombers,

578
00:55:59,457 --> 00:56:02,691
a rack of RPGs,
17 dead, 37 wounded.

579
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:05,494
     I gotta get a coffee.
       - Do we know what
       they were after?

580
00:56:05,496 --> 00:56:09,732
- Yeah. Police Headquarters. We
 just got caught up in it. And
 that is Kandahar Karma, baby,

581
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:13,469
 that's what that is. And I got
 to say you handled your rifle

582
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:15,838
like you got ice in your veins.

583
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:19,475
 - All those Tallies were using
  AKs, which is a great weapon
  if you're in a phone booth.

584
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:22,811
You work the city a lot?

585
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:26,749
      - A fair bit, yeah.
     - You got a weird job.

586
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:29,551
- Oh yeah, and... and you don't?

587
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:31,520
           - Me? No.

588
00:56:31,522 --> 00:56:33,522
 No, everybody knows the rules:

589
00:56:33,524 --> 00:56:35,924
  you pick up an AK, an RPG,
  you're gonna hear about it.

590
00:56:35,926 --> 00:56:38,527
     There's no grey area.

591
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:41,730
 - Well, except back home where
  they think what you do is a
  little too... I don't know--

592
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,067
   premeditated. But my shit?

593
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,102
       Hearts and Minds?
    They lap that stuff up.

594
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:50,038
  It's got a moral ring to it,
  even if it's mostly just PR.

595
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,940
      - You believe that?

596
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:54,910
            - These people here?

597
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:58,447
        They got no use for what
               we have on offer.

598
00:56:58,449 --> 00:57:00,983
  They don't want Justin Bieber,
               or Tom Jefferson,

599
00:57:00,985 --> 00:57:03,452
     or our fucking pornography.

600
00:57:03,454 --> 00:57:06,789
    They just want our money and
      a little bit of stability.

601
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:09,792
      - So how do we win?
     - There is no winning.

602
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:12,494
   There's just an end state and
      that's gonna get laid down

603
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:14,530
   by foreign policy, not by us.

604
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,465
- You're a cynical man.

605
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:19,535
       - Not about this country,
                        I'm not.

606
00:57:19,537 --> 00:57:23,472
    Not about these people.
         - Me neither.

607
00:57:23,474 --> 00:57:26,208
    And I gotta believe that
   if I put a 6-dollar round,

608
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:28,877
        just one bullet
      in the right place,

609
00:57:28,879 --> 00:57:31,146
   I could change everything.

610
00:57:31,148 --> 00:57:35,150
      - You may be right.

611
00:57:35,152 --> 00:57:39,221
- You gonna
stick around at Sper?

612
00:57:39,223 --> 00:57:41,824
   - No, I'm gonna hop a flight.
            Should grab my gear.

613
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:43,892
       I'll be in touch.

614
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,862
       - I'll be around.

615
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,914
Don't say anything, just listen.

616
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,983
     I know our situation.
 I know it doesn't make sense.

617
00:58:07,985 --> 00:58:11,153
   But you need to hear this
     from me. I love you.

618
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:15,591
 Right down to the bone, right
 down to the goddamned fucking
 marrow. You need to know that.

619
00:58:15,593 --> 00:58:19,761
             - Ditto. All of it.

620
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:30,272
  - Haji, what are you doing?
    - Cleaning the chairs.

621
00:58:30,274 --> 00:58:33,642
      - It's not your job.
    - Well, whose job is it?
     - Well, it's nobody's.

622
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:36,245
         - This is why
     you have dirty chairs.

623
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:39,114
  - I need some tea. Come on.

624
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:43,252
Why would he even agree
to a meeting if he has
absolutely nothing to say?

625
00:58:43,254 --> 00:58:45,854
           - Maybe he just wants
           the coalition to know
                 that he's back.

626
00:58:45,856 --> 00:58:49,558
- Maybe, but for what?

627
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:52,561
We need to know
who's in that village.

628
00:58:52,563 --> 00:58:55,163
Can you get into the Tazkera
Registry, find out
who lives there?

629
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:58,934
  - I have an uncle, he works
   in the Governor's Palace.

630
00:58:58,936 --> 00:59:01,136
- God, how many uncles
do you have?

631
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:04,873
- Many.
           Tell me...

632
00:59:06,876 --> 00:59:10,279
 What do you think of my hair?
 I've been using the shampoo.

633
00:59:10,281 --> 00:59:13,815
- It looks silky smooth
and very manageable.

634
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:16,118
        - And my hands?

635
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,687
- Soft. Like a baby's bum.

636
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:22,591
- You're the best.

637
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,913
- Hey there, Chewey.

638
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:46,848
I need a favour.

639
00:59:46,850 --> 00:59:49,318
I'm looking at a village
at this grid marker,

640
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:53,322
any events in the last, I don't
know, say the last six months.
       - Come on, Pete--

641
00:59:53,324 --> 00:59:56,892
 - I know, I should go through
Armstrong, but I don't even know
 what I'm actually looking for.

642
00:59:56,894 --> 00:59:59,227
 And I don't feel like doing a
 whole work-up just on a hunch.

643
00:59:59,229 --> 01:00:03,732
 - You want a visual, I assume.
  - Anything with eyes, yeah.
      - I'll let you know.

644
01:00:03,734 --> 01:00:07,169
          - Thank you.

645
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:36,064
       - Anything useful?
            - Maybe.

646
01:00:36,066 --> 01:00:38,734
       What do I owe you?

647
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:41,903
- I'll take your beer allotment
   at the end of the month.
- I only get two, same as you.

648
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:44,873
   - And I'll take them both.
   - Alright, they're yours.

649
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:49,177
And you can clear all this shit
off. Thanks, Chewey.

650
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,116
               Oh, yeah, and one
                  of these days,

651
01:00:54,118 --> 01:00:56,251
              I'm gonna spool up
                  a fire mission

652
01:00:56,253 --> 01:00:58,654
       and train my triple seven
               on your backside.

653
01:01:03,693 --> 01:01:05,761
            - Okay.

654
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,298
          - Hey, Haji.
      What you got for me?

655
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,168
 - Oh, it's bad. It's Bashir's.

656
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,737
      - You're kidding me.
      BDK owns that land?

657
01:01:15,739 --> 01:01:17,773
You're sure?

658
01:01:17,775 --> 01:01:20,942
 - Alright, listen, can you get
     out to Sper tomorrow?

659
01:01:20,944 --> 01:01:23,679
- Yes, no problem.
   -

660
01:01:23,681 --> 01:01:26,448
   you're just a contractor
   working on a school or...

661
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:28,784
    I don't know, a fucking
   kite factory or something.

662
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:32,120
            - Okay.
    - Take care, my friend.

663
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:45,133
 - Have you had any tenderness
  in your breasts, or nausea,

664
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,836
     or just the spotting?
    - No, just the spotting.

665
01:01:47,838 --> 01:01:50,272
 I'm really managing my cycle.

666
01:01:50,274 --> 01:01:52,974
    I haven't had my period
        in six months.

667
01:01:52,976 --> 01:01:55,744
      I don't know, maybe
     I missed a pill or...

668
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:58,413
 maybe I'm just being paranoid.
            - Yeah.

669
01:01:58,415 --> 01:02:01,249
     If we find something,

670
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:05,220
    what do we do? You know
   I'm supposed to report it.
 - Well. I'm asking you not to.

671
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,489
              As a friend, okay?

672
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,860
           - Oh, my.

673
01:02:27,944 --> 01:02:30,178
         - Oh, my God.

674
01:02:34,884 --> 01:02:37,419
            Okay...

675
01:03:36,212 --> 01:03:39,981
- How's Joey?

676
01:03:45,455 --> 01:03:47,522
    - Oh, come on, honestly?

677
01:03:47,524 --> 01:03:51,827
He really misses me?
  -

678
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:57,065
- I miss you, too, baby.

679
01:03:57,067 --> 01:03:59,501
    - A "wide open prairie"
           miss you.

680
01:04:04,441 --> 01:04:06,875
- Oh, Jesus,

681
01:04:06,877 --> 01:04:09,277
       you have no idea
     how much I miss them.

682
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:12,948
            Hang on.

683
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:38,406
- I had to go back because this
op was pretty early in the roto,

684
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:42,510
but the DETs observed
between 15 and 20 Tallies
moving across the field.

685
01:04:42,512 --> 01:04:44,980
   Because of the force size,
      they didn't engage.

686
01:04:44,982 --> 01:04:48,516
 Company command requested the
   grid. They called it in,
        artillery beat

687
01:04:48,518 --> 01:04:51,019
     the shit out of them.
   - There was some fast air
   in there as well, right?

688
01:04:51,021 --> 01:04:53,622
     - Yeah, I believe so.
       He had two A10s.
- And they destroyed the field?

689
01:04:53,624 --> 01:04:55,891
  - That's what Wart Hogs do.

690
01:04:55,893 --> 01:04:59,461
- Well, see, this matters
because, as it turns out,

691
01:04:59,463 --> 01:05:02,063
the field is "owned"
by Bashir Daoud Khan.

692
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:05,166
            - BDK?
  - See, BDK leases the field

693
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:09,471
to the farmer who's basically...
       he's like a slave, right?

694
01:05:09,473 --> 01:05:12,374
  The farmer works the field,
    and then at the end of
       the poppy season,

695
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:15,644
he's got to hand over 5,000 USD.

696
01:05:15,646 --> 01:05:18,046
Whatever he gets on top of that
       he gets to keep,

697
01:05:18,048 --> 01:05:20,248
   which is probably, like,
  800 bucks, somewhere around
     the national average.

698
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:24,653
 Now, in this particular case,
    the Tallies go running
       around the field,

699
01:05:24,655 --> 01:05:27,555
 ISAF blows the shit out of it,

700
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:31,626
and the crop is ruined. And now,
well, the farmer, he's got less
  than Adam before the apple.

701
01:05:31,628 --> 01:05:35,096
  Well, BDK shows up and says,
 "Hello, where's my 5,000 USD?"

702
01:05:35,098 --> 01:05:38,934
  And the farmer says, "Well,
 the crop was ruined, you know?
      No fault of my own."

703
01:05:38,936 --> 01:05:42,037
    BDK says, "I don't give
       a shit, I'm evil.

704
01:05:42,039 --> 01:05:46,074
 I will have my 5,000 dollars.
And you have 'x' amount of time
     to come up with it."

705
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,443
  - Wow, this guy sounds like
         Tony Soprano.

706
01:05:48,445 --> 01:05:51,279
      - Yeah. But without
        the therapist.
         - We Afghans,

707
01:05:51,281 --> 01:05:53,214
 we're not very big on therapy.

708
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,987
    - Alright, so why are we
    looking at this farmer?
   - His name is Abdul Malik.

709
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:02,624
His father's name is Haji Malik.
      Lion of the Desert.

710
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:06,728
   - His father is The Ghost?
           Holy shit.

711
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:10,598
- And we think this is why The
Ghost has returned-- to protect
   the honour of his family.

712
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:13,501
- And there's some bad history
between BDK and The Ghost.

713
01:06:13,503 --> 01:06:15,737
Now, I don't want things
to go haywire because
I want The Ghost.

714
01:06:15,739 --> 01:06:18,106
I want him to work with us
because he could be

715
01:06:18,108 --> 01:06:20,308
a powerful ally for what we're
trying to achieve down here.

716
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:23,611
      Maybe we'll actually
        get Hyena built.
    - So, where do I fit in?

717
01:06:23,613 --> 01:06:26,614
- Well, we think the date
for payment is close, yeah?

718
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:30,085
Two, three days, kinda thing.
So I need eyes on that village.

719
01:06:30,087 --> 01:06:33,488
I need to know about the comings
and goings, the who, the what--
all that kind of thing.

720
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:36,992
     - Alright. I got my snipers
        spread all over the area
                   of operation.

721
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,094
          But I could re-deploy,
               rotate the DETs--

722
01:06:39,096 --> 01:06:42,263
 two days on, two days off, sort
     of thing. Starting tonight.

723
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:44,599
- Outstanding!

724
01:06:46,502 --> 01:06:49,637
     - You ever try a date?
        - No, thank you.

725
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:53,541
  - ¶¶ Baby, please don't go ¶

726
01:06:53,543 --> 01:06:58,113
   ¶ Baby, please don't go ¶

727
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:01,649
¶ You got dimples in your jaw ¶

728
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:05,453
¶ You got dimples in your jaw ¶

729
01:07:05,455 --> 01:07:07,756
¶ You got dimples in your jaw ¶

730
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:10,692
      ¶ And that ain't all
   So baby, please don't go ¶

731
01:07:10,694 --> 01:07:14,496
        - Comms check?
        - Check. Check.

732
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:17,799
     - Comms check to Wilf?
      - Check. Roger you.

733
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,801
    - AKA Training Magnate?
           - Check.

734
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:22,504
   - So you guys are gonna be
     dropped off somewhere
         about here...

735
01:07:22,506 --> 01:07:25,206
       - AKA Smelly Shit?
            - Check.

736
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:28,276
    - You guys make your way
   up into the mountain here.
        - AKA Douchebag?

737
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:31,379
   - ¶ Hey-hey, little girl ¶

738
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,816
       ¶ Hey, little girl
     Hey-hey, little girl ¶

739
01:07:34,818 --> 01:07:39,087
       ¶ Hey, little girl
             Oooh ¶

740
01:07:39,089 --> 01:07:43,691
    ¶ Hey-hey, little girl ¶

741
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,495
    ¶ Hey-hey, little girl ¶

742
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:51,733
    ¶ Baby, please don't go
     Ah, don't go, honey ¶

743
01:08:13,622 --> 01:08:17,625
   ¶ Baby, please don't go ¶

744
01:08:17,627 --> 01:08:20,728
   ¶ Baby, please don't go ¶¶

745
01:09:06,575 --> 01:09:11,146
- Brr!!

746
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:29,631
  - You seeing anything, Tank?
          - Negative.
    - Alright, take a break.

747
01:09:29,633 --> 01:09:32,300
                   - Roger that.

748
01:09:32,302 --> 01:09:35,837
         - Hey, Putts?

749
01:09:39,775 --> 01:09:43,545
       Is there something
       you wanna tell me?

750
01:09:45,447 --> 01:09:48,349
 Perry Como? In a combat zone?

751
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:50,885
      - It was on shuffle.
        - Unacceptable.

752
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:54,722
Completely inappropriate.

753
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:24,786
  - You know, I've been thinking
    about what you said about...

754
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:27,288
            changing everything,
      you know, with one bullet.

755
01:10:27,290 --> 01:10:30,291
                      You really
                   believe that?

756
01:10:32,528 --> 01:10:34,529
    - Yeah, I believe that.

757
01:10:34,531 --> 01:10:36,898
      I'm here, aren't I?
            - Yeah.

758
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,702
                           Yeah.

759
01:10:40,704 --> 01:10:42,804
        - Look at this.

760
01:10:46,542 --> 01:10:49,544
- Okay, what the fuck is this?

761
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:51,679
- I'm a terrible dancer.

762
01:10:51,681 --> 01:10:55,016
        - You're an unbelievably
                     bad dancer.

763
01:10:55,018 --> 01:10:57,785
    - But I'm a great shot.
     And I've always been.

764
01:10:57,787 --> 01:11:00,521
    Ever since I was a kid.

765
01:11:00,523 --> 01:11:02,890
It might have been irresponsible
  to put a weapon in my hand,

766
01:11:02,892 --> 01:11:05,560
  but people would get hunting
     licences -they didn't
        even have a gun-

767
01:11:05,562 --> 01:11:07,562
   just so that I could hunt
       on their behalf.

768
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:11,266
I used to shoot hard
to shoot game. Put food
on people's tables

769
01:11:11,268 --> 01:11:14,402
     when times were hard--
     - Sir, Captain Boland
     wants to see you both.

770
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:17,438
                 - We're on.

771
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:30,618
 - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha.
          Send. Over.

772
01:11:30,620 --> 01:11:34,022
  - 66 Bravo. We got a convoy
    heading our way. Over.

773
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:40,728
       - 66 Bravo, three
       white Suburbans,

774
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:43,698
  coming in fast-- looks like
  they're up-armoured. Over.

775
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,000
  - Three Niner Alpha, what's
   happening in the village?

776
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,673
- 66 Bravo, all is quiet. Over.

777
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:54,709
- They're not ready,
they got no... Goddamn it.

778
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,784
 - Okay, what's going on here?
      - I don't know yet.

779
01:12:02,786 --> 01:12:06,788
        Get everyone up.
            - Roger.

780
01:12:06,790 --> 01:12:09,657
     - Holy shit. 66 Bravo,

781
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,360
   we've got two VIPs exiting
   the vehicle. First, 40's,

782
01:12:12,362 --> 01:12:15,029
    black hair, bad dye job,
       beady little eyes.

783
01:12:15,031 --> 01:12:17,532
- Can he confirm VIP is BDK?

784
01:12:17,534 --> 01:12:21,402
 - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha.
  Is VIP BDK? Can you confirm?

785
01:12:21,404 --> 01:12:25,807
    - 66 Bravo, confirming.
VIP call sign Bravo Delta Kilo.

786
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:28,810
 Second civ, Hamid Walid Khan.

787
01:12:28,812 --> 01:12:32,613
 Call sign Hotel Whiskey Kilo.

788
01:12:32,615 --> 01:12:35,883
       Three Niner Alpha,
       this is 66 Bravo.

789
01:12:35,885 --> 01:12:39,087
       We've got Taliban,
         counting four.

790
01:12:39,089 --> 01:12:43,658
  - He's got Tallies with him?
  - A guy like BDK plays both
      sides of the fence.

791
01:12:43,660 --> 01:12:46,894
  - 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha,
          do you have clearance?
      Are they carrying weapons?

792
01:12:46,896 --> 01:12:50,365
- Wednesdays, Fridays, he's
with us. Tuesdays, Thursdays,
he's with the Tallies,

793
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:54,001
and on days off they're
    both running narcotics.

794
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:56,804
     negative. No weapons.
    But they're in costume.

795
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:59,407
 Black turbans, black man jams.

796
01:12:59,409 --> 01:13:02,877
 These guys are not even trying
  to hide who they are. Over.

797
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:25,633
66 Bravo. We have hostile action
       against civilians.

798
01:13:25,635 --> 01:13:28,002
            - Three Niner Alpha.
         Clarify hostile action.

799
01:13:28,004 --> 01:13:30,838
     - They're taking kids,
         little girls.

800
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,940
- Three Niner Alpha. Do you have
     imminent threat? Over.

801
01:13:32,942 --> 01:13:35,042
     - 66 Bravo. Negative.

802
01:13:49,458 --> 01:13:52,660
   Authorize to engage? I am
getting ready to take the shot.

803
01:13:52,662 --> 01:13:54,929
- No, I'm stepping in.

804
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:59,000
  66 Bravo, this is Golf Niner
   Whiskey. Sit tight. Over.
        - What the fuck?

805
01:13:59,002 --> 01:14:02,203
        Take them down!
- Unless they pull out weapons,
    we can't get involved.

806
01:14:02,205 --> 01:14:05,139
  - 66 Bravo. I can intervene.

807
01:14:05,141 --> 01:14:08,876
- Golf Niner Whiskey. Negative.
   Unless you see a weapon,
       do not intervene.

808
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:12,046
      - 66 Bravo. They are
      taking little kids.

809
01:14:12,048 --> 01:14:14,215
- - 66 Bravo.

810
01:14:14,217 --> 01:14:17,084
       Clarify. Are you
      fucking kidding me?

811
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:20,555
  - Golf Niner Whiskey. Unless
you see a weapon, do not engage.

812
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,590
    - We gotta do something!
  - Your guys will stand down!

813
01:14:22,592 --> 01:14:24,759
        - Jesus Christ!
    - Settle down, Warrant.

814
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:27,528
             Fuck!

815
01:14:30,732 --> 01:14:33,134
            - Fuck!

816
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,978
- Hey, you're out of line here!
  - Why didn't you override?

817
01:14:43,980 --> 01:14:47,048
     - Because it's an intel op,
 it's their call. It's the rules
of engagement and you know that!

818
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:50,017
    - It's a fucking crime!
    - Hey, we need to talk.

819
01:14:50,019 --> 01:14:53,221
- No, you know what, we're good.
   We're good. Hey, Mitchell.

820
01:14:53,223 --> 01:14:56,157
What are those girls,
like, 8, 10 years old? Huh?

821
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:58,893
 And we just stand there? What's
   going to happen to them, huh?

822
01:14:58,895 --> 01:15:01,629
        - They're gonna be sold,
     that's what's gonna happen.

823
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:04,999
         BDK will hand them over
     to the Tallies. The Tallies
    will put them on the market.

824
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:08,970
    Whatever they get above five
  they're going to keep, but BDK
     will get his 5,000 dollars.

825
01:15:08,972 --> 01:15:12,673
 And then, I don't know, they're
     gonna end up in some shitty
              marriage in Dubai.

826
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:15,176
  Or worse, they're gonna end up
    sucking dick in some brothel

827
01:15:15,178 --> 01:15:17,678
       outside of Fort McMurray.

828
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,680
- You know this
and we don't intervene?

829
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:22,149
   - We didn't intervene because
 we didn't have imminent threat.

830
01:15:22,151 --> 01:15:25,052
             Those are the rules
            of engagement. I had
              to make that call.

831
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:28,623
 And we didn't intervene because
      BDK is protected by a roof
                 on top of which

832
01:15:28,625 --> 01:15:32,527
is a great big fucking sign that
 reads "CIA." He's their asset.

833
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:35,096
  Now, if you want to bring down
         our General and fuck up
        the entire battle group,

834
01:15:35,098 --> 01:15:37,732
          be my guest, go ahead,
                      shoot him.

835
01:15:37,734 --> 01:15:41,736
   - What kind of fucking war
     are we fighting here?
- Oh, come on, it's not one war.

836
01:15:41,738 --> 01:15:45,706
 It's a whole bunch of different
       wars. And mine, it's like
                a 3D chess game.

837
01:15:45,708 --> 01:15:47,742
 Half the time I don't even know
        who the fuck I'm playing
                        against.

838
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:51,646
- We're not
playing games here!

839
01:15:51,648 --> 01:15:53,681
                - No, we're not.

840
01:15:53,683 --> 01:15:55,883
      But we're not here so kids
           can fly kites either.

841
01:15:55,885 --> 01:15:59,287
      - Then what the fuck
       are we doing here?
- We are rolling back the clock.

842
01:15:59,289 --> 01:16:03,658
 And we are stacking the deck so
  this time the complete fuckin'
              crazies don't win.

843
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:07,094
 Haji, did you get all of that?
  - Yes, the relay was clear.

844
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:12,099
  He's going to have to react.

845
01:16:12,101 --> 01:16:14,101
      He will make Badal.

846
01:16:14,103 --> 01:16:17,104
  - Okay, Badal is another one

847
01:16:17,106 --> 01:16:20,708
   of those tribal pillars.
It's like... Come on, sit down.

848
01:16:22,010 --> 01:16:24,579
           Sit down.

849
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:29,684
    Badal basically means, like,

850
01:16:29,686 --> 01:16:32,153
 revenge or... it's like "an eye
      for an eye" kind of thing.

851
01:16:32,155 --> 01:16:34,622
   - It's more about honour.
         If the leader

852
01:16:34,624 --> 01:16:38,893
  of the family cannot restore
      honour to them, then
     he must leave forever.

853
01:16:38,895 --> 01:16:41,762
        So The Ghost has
    no choice. He must act.
    - Now, here's the thing:

854
01:16:41,764 --> 01:16:45,032
   BDK served under The Ghost in
   the war against the Russians.

855
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:47,368
   The story goes that a Russian
               chopper went down

856
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,870
               and BDK ass-raped
              one of the pilots.

857
01:16:49,872 --> 01:16:53,074
    And as punishment, The Ghost
        embarrassed him in front
         of the rest of the Muj.

858
01:16:53,076 --> 01:16:56,911
- So, you see, Badal continues.
- BDK is a bad guy and he needs

859
01:16:56,913 --> 01:17:01,282
             to be brought down.
        Now, we can't do it. But
      The Ghost can. To do that,

860
01:17:01,284 --> 01:17:03,651
   we gotta boost the stature of
The Ghost. And we're gonna start

861
01:17:03,653 --> 01:17:06,253
        by inviting The Ghost to
    the ceremony for Hyena Road.

862
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:10,024
      - Put them together?
       Badal is possible.

863
01:17:10,026 --> 01:17:13,094
       - I'm also gonna offer up
         the safe house. If they
             meet on Hyena Road,

864
01:17:13,096 --> 01:17:15,930
it's political. If they meet at
the safe house, it's personal.

865
01:17:15,932 --> 01:17:17,999
      Either way, there's
      gonna be fireworks.

866
01:17:18,001 --> 01:17:20,801
 Okay, there's a flight heading
      back to KAF in about
         10, 11 mikes.

867
01:17:20,803 --> 01:17:22,870
      I'm gonna hop on it.
        Now, I need you

868
01:17:22,872 --> 01:17:25,306
             to set up a meeting
           with The Ghost. We'll
        do it at the safe house.

869
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,775
            And I need your team
           to scope out security

870
01:17:27,777 --> 01:17:30,211
            at the ceremony site
          and at the safe house.

871
01:17:32,147 --> 01:17:35,683
                Ryan. Ryan...

872
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:40,788
        Don't think I don't feel
   for those girls, 'cause I do.

873
01:17:40,790 --> 01:17:43,691
        And we'll do what we can
                   to find them.

874
01:17:43,693 --> 01:17:48,195
    But right now, in the bigger
     picture, we need The Ghost.

875
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:51,158
              ¶¶¶

876
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:38,265
     - Travis said you were
        looking for me.
            - Yeah.

877
01:20:38,267 --> 01:20:42,403
     - Alright, look, I'm sorry.
                 I lost my shit.

878
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:47,374
   But you know me. And you know
          that most of the time,

879
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:50,444
 I'm proud about what we do here
         and I'm proud about how
           we go about doing it,

880
01:20:50,446 --> 01:20:52,413
         but... those were kids.

881
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:57,284
      And if we can't help them,
             what's the point of
                 doing all this?

882
01:20:57,286 --> 01:21:00,454
- I don't have
an answer for that,

883
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:04,892
and for what it's worth,
I agree with you. But that's not
what I wanted to see you about.

884
01:21:06,628 --> 01:21:09,864
Do you mind just
closing the door?

885
01:21:15,904 --> 01:21:19,139
            Here...

886
01:21:19,141 --> 01:21:22,443
    Have a seat, I just have
     to show you something.

887
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:41,528
    - What's this?

888
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:44,598
          - Uh, that's our baby.

889
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:48,135
         It was Cyprus, I guess.

890
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,313
- That's one of the most
beautiful things I've ever seen.

891
01:22:03,618 --> 01:22:07,321
The most beautiful thing.

892
01:22:07,323 --> 01:22:10,457
          - This kind of changes
             things, doesn't it?

893
01:22:10,459 --> 01:22:13,160
- Yeah, it changes everything.

894
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:15,529
  - I think that in terms of the
   brass we're going to be okay,

895
01:22:15,531 --> 01:22:18,065
             because it happened
         while we were on leave,

896
01:22:18,067 --> 01:22:21,402
     but we've got to figure out
            what we're gonna do.

897
01:22:21,404 --> 01:22:24,705
       - Figure out what
        we're gonna do?

898
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,610
We're gonna have a baby.

899
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:33,347
        - Is that what you want?

900
01:22:36,451 --> 01:22:40,087
- Yeah, of course it's
what I want. More than anything.

901
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:43,257
         - Okay, good. I'm glad.

902
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:45,526
       - You know, you're
        making me crazy.

903
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:49,096
                 - Yeah, I know,
        I'm making myself crazy.

904
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:52,032
- What did you think I'd think?
 - I don't know, I just was...

905
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:55,202
     I was nervous. We didn't...

906
01:22:57,405 --> 01:23:00,140
...leave things very well.

907
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:03,210
- Come here, come here.

908
01:23:03,212 --> 01:23:05,245
We're gonna have a baby.

909
01:23:11,386 --> 01:23:13,520
You sure it's mine?

910
01:23:29,237 --> 01:23:32,239
                  - Niner Niner,
                    TAC on base.

911
01:23:39,147 --> 01:23:42,549
    - Cocks. Another IED hit
         out on Hyena.

912
01:23:42,551 --> 01:23:46,487
  One KIA. A guy out of Kabul,
  father of how many, Shorty?

913
01:23:46,489 --> 01:23:49,656
         - Five, sir.
         - Five. Fuck.

914
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,659
 Fighting these pricks is like
  nailing Jell-O to the wall.

915
01:23:52,661 --> 01:23:57,498
  I cannot keep losing civilians
 if we're gonna get Hyena built,

916
01:23:57,500 --> 01:24:01,635
 and if we're gonna prevail down
there, Hyena's gotta go through.

917
01:24:01,637 --> 01:24:04,338
I've gotta get out there,

918
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:06,340
    get on the ground, gotta get
         my Leopard II's rolling

919
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:08,375
        and I've gotta blow them
      fuckers out of their beds.

920
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:11,245
                 I've gotta find
           their weapons caches.

921
01:24:11,247 --> 01:24:13,647
      I've gotta fuck with their
            command and control,
            and I cannot do that

922
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:14,448
         bouncing around goddamn
                    helicopters.

923
01:24:16,651 --> 01:24:20,154
          Now that's the kinetic
  imperative, Pete. So I'm gonna
     need a little help from you

924
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:23,290
   non-kinetic types. I need you
     effects guys to go in there
            and work your magic.

925
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:26,193
- Understood, sir,
and we are working on it.

926
01:24:26,195 --> 01:24:29,663
My Afghan guy's telling me that
BDK is behind all of this shit.

927
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:32,699
The more the security situation
deteriorates, the more money
he's making

928
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:35,302
out of all the gravel trucks
and all the other stuff
he's into us for.

929
01:24:35,304 --> 01:24:37,404
 - Fucking horrible little man.
        - If he was out

930
01:24:37,406 --> 01:24:39,673
 of the picture, getting Hyena
    through would be a hell
       of a lot easier.

931
01:24:39,675 --> 01:24:43,544
         - If he got knocked off
    his perch, I would not weep.

932
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:46,680
      - Understood, sir.
  - I hear The Ghost is back.

933
01:24:46,682 --> 01:24:49,383
          - Yes, sir.
       - Is he a threat?

934
01:24:49,385 --> 01:24:52,519
- Just the opposite. I think
he could be a powerful ally.

935
01:24:52,521 --> 01:24:55,255
   - I don't care how you do it,
     just make sure my civilians
              aren't getting hit

936
01:24:55,257 --> 01:24:57,257
           every time they drive
     a fucking truck down there.

937
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,227
       - Understood, sir.
        - Thanks, Pete.

938
01:25:11,306 --> 01:25:13,340
           - Haji, what the fuck
                  are you doing?

939
01:25:13,342 --> 01:25:16,477
- What? You can't see
out of these things.

940
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:20,114
   - There's nothing to see.
- No, not the way they are, no.

941
01:25:20,116 --> 01:25:24,251
       - Okay, get in touch with
   The Ghost. The meeting is on.

942
01:25:24,253 --> 01:25:27,254
      - You have approval?
      - It's always better

943
01:25:27,256 --> 01:25:30,224
     to ask for forgiveness than
      permission, you know that.

944
01:25:30,226 --> 01:25:33,560
                  We'll meet him
              at the safe house.

945
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:26,780
- This house is a key feature--
 it's our asset, a safe house.

946
01:26:26,782 --> 01:26:29,383
    We'll set up our OP here

947
01:26:29,385 --> 01:26:31,451
         at the summit
    of the saddleback ridge.

948
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:34,821
 And that'll give us clear line
     of sight to both sides
          of the hill.

949
01:26:34,823 --> 01:26:37,191
    Here, at the safe house,

950
01:26:37,193 --> 01:26:39,793
  and here, where the ceremony
    is going to take place.

951
01:26:39,795 --> 01:26:44,364
      - What's the range?
 - It's comfortable, 1150, 750
 meters both sides of the hill.

952
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:47,734
    - What about extraction?
      - We'll ex-fil down
         the back side,

953
01:26:47,736 --> 01:26:51,338
 through the grape fields, and
 get picked up on route Hyena.

954
01:26:51,340 --> 01:26:53,974
 - How's this house gonna play?

955
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:55,642
       - That's unknown.

956
01:26:55,644 --> 01:26:58,879
     There's an offer out
 to The Ghost and BDK to show.

957
01:26:58,881 --> 01:27:02,616
    Intel thinks they'll show up
        either at the safe house
             or at the ceremony.

958
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:05,285
        So we need eyes on both.

959
01:27:05,287 --> 01:27:07,487
                Alright, this is
                    a tricky Op,

960
01:27:07,489 --> 01:27:11,692
        so I'll take lead. Wilf,
     you'll stand this one down.

961
01:27:11,694 --> 01:27:14,494
    Alright, let's gear up.

962
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,565
- I would like to thank you
for meeting with me.

963
01:27:22,737 --> 01:27:24,771
- He says,
"The honour is mine."

964
01:27:37,452 --> 01:27:40,887
He says, "I'm surprised
to be here. I used to come
to this house many times."

965
01:27:40,889 --> 01:27:45,325
  He's asking you, do you know
  who used to own this house?
         - Mullah Omar.

966
01:27:53,501 --> 01:27:55,402
- He saved his ears
but he lost his eye.

967
01:27:55,404 --> 01:27:59,273
     - What does that mean?
         - Same, same.
       - Same, same what?

968
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:02,409
   - Same, same, same, same.

969
01:28:02,411 --> 01:28:05,312
       - If you ever need to use
        this house, for whatever
             reason, it's yours.

970
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:13,720
 There was an event in Panjaway
   the other day, the village
         of Haji Baba.

971
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:17,724
Two little girls were taken out
 of the arms of their father.

972
01:28:25,033 --> 01:28:27,034
             - And he says, "Why
           have you come to me?"

973
01:28:27,036 --> 01:28:29,569
- Because the little
girls were taken

974
01:28:29,571 --> 01:28:32,639
by Bashir Daoud Khan.

975
01:28:36,477 --> 01:28:38,879
My General is
a compassionate man.

976
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:41,548
He's a student of Pashtunwali.

977
01:28:41,550 --> 01:28:44,851
And he would like to help you,
to help all Afghans,

978
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:47,921
to help the village
of Haji Baba.

979
01:28:57,398 --> 01:29:00,734
 And he would be very honoured
 if you would accept this gift.

980
01:29:00,736 --> 01:29:03,537
   Five thousand US dollars.

981
01:29:07,442 --> 01:29:09,109
He would also be honoured
if you would attend

982
01:29:09,111 --> 01:29:12,479
the ceremony for Hyena Road.

983
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:25,125
         - He's saying, "Why me?
     I'm a simple grape farmer."

984
01:29:25,127 --> 01:29:27,527
- He understands this.

985
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,831
But your presence would do him
a great honour as an Elder
of the region.

986
01:29:33,901 --> 01:29:37,671
  - "Who else will be there?"

987
01:29:37,673 --> 01:29:41,475
- Bashir Daoud Khan.

988
01:29:54,956 --> 01:29:57,958
- "I have known this man,
Bashir, since he was a boy."

989
01:30:09,604 --> 01:30:13,874
"He brought great dishonour
to our cause. And he was
punished by my own hands."

990
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:31,992
"Thank your General
for his kindness.

991
01:30:31,994 --> 01:30:36,062
And it will be
my honour to attend."

992
01:30:43,771 --> 01:30:46,640
            He says that chicken
                      hates you.

993
01:30:51,646 --> 01:30:54,448
  - Yeah, Haji, it's me. Yeah,

994
01:30:54,450 --> 01:30:57,451
    I'm watching him walk up
    the side of a mountain.

995
01:30:57,453 --> 01:31:00,086
 Yeah, he says he's gonna show
 up, but I got the feeling he's
  got something up his sleeve,

996
01:31:00,088 --> 01:31:03,523
 so I'm gonna need you to get
 your eyes and ears out there,
 see what you can learn, okay?

997
01:31:03,525 --> 01:31:07,594
    Yeah. Wa Alaikum Salaam.

998
01:31:09,464 --> 01:31:12,833
   Okay, let's get our gear,
           we'll go.

999
01:31:24,779 --> 01:31:28,648
- Whoa.

1000
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,784
                     Local meat?

1001
01:31:30,786 --> 01:31:34,221
       - Heavenly Father,

1002
01:31:34,223 --> 01:31:38,625
        please protect
      those little girls.

1003
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:43,497
      And watch over them
      and bring them home.

1004
01:32:02,650 --> 01:32:05,519
  - Listen, I'm not sure I was
 entirely clear about all this,

1005
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:08,822
   so I want to spell it out.

1006
01:32:08,824 --> 01:32:12,626
  I'd like it very much if...

1007
01:32:12,628 --> 01:32:14,794
       if you'd marry me,
        Captain Bowman.

1008
01:32:14,796 --> 01:32:18,164
- I would also
like that very much,

1009
01:32:18,166 --> 01:32:21,801
Warrant Officer Sanders.

1010
01:32:30,711 --> 01:32:34,281
 - Okay, I've gotta go. We're
heading out. I've gotta get up.

1011
01:32:34,283 --> 01:32:37,851
- Let me help you with that kit.

1012
01:32:55,670 --> 01:32:58,338
    We're crazy.

1013
01:32:58,340 --> 01:33:01,608
          - Fucking certifiable.

1014
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:06,880
- Be careful, okay.

1015
01:33:06,882 --> 01:33:09,649
                    - I promise.

1016
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:21,094
               You're driving me
                          crazy.

1017
01:33:51,258 --> 01:33:54,060
          - Hey, Jenn.
             - Hey.

1018
01:33:54,062 --> 01:33:56,763
  So how do you think this is
      going to play out?

1019
01:33:56,765 --> 01:34:00,934
    - Hard to say, a lot of
 variables. If the plan holds,
 we're golden. Anything shifts,

1020
01:34:00,936 --> 01:34:03,670
           who knows?
    - We got Niner Niner TAC
         en route now.

1021
01:34:03,672 --> 01:34:07,007
 - Okay, everybody, here we go.
 General's on his way. You were
   down at the ceremony site?

1022
01:34:07,009 --> 01:34:10,677
         - Yeah, on my way here;
              usual motley crew.

1023
01:34:10,679 --> 01:34:14,147
          Goats everywhere. Shit

1031
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:49,349
    - I bet you not one VIP
      is gonna be there.

1032
01:34:49,351 --> 01:34:52,686
    They're not gonna show.
- I think they'll be there, sir.

1033
01:34:52,688 --> 01:34:56,423
    It's important to them.
    - Twenty-five bucks says
       they're a no-show.

1034
01:34:56,425 --> 01:34:59,726

   - I love your enthusiasm,
            Shorty.

          don't you?

1040
01:35:36,298 --> 01:35:39,332
- I'm an optimist, sir.

1041
01:35:39,334 --> 01:35:41,835
   - You're a fucking idiot,
            Shorty.

1042
01:35:41,837 --> 01:35:44,404

      - Three Niner Alpha,
      white SUVs, confirm?

    SUVs, up-armoured. Over.

       off approach road

1047
01:36:15,170 --> 01:36:17,437
      heading in direction
      of safe house. Over.

1048
01:36:17,439 --> 01:36:21,074

       The Ghost and BDK
  will meet at the safe house,

1050
01:36:23,812 --> 01:36:27,313
not at the ceremony site.
So this is probably
gonna get personal.

1051
01:36:27,315 --> 01:36:30,183
 You got that relayed at ASIC?
    - You're hooked up now,

    into listening devices.

1065
01:37:17,532 --> 01:37:19,833
           But don't ask me how.
                 I have no idea.

1066
01:37:21,202 --> 01:37:24,838
   - One One Zulu, first trap

   Call sign Ghost is alone.

1076
01:38:15,422 --> 01:38:18,291
   - He shouldn't be alone.
 He should have guys with him.

1077
01:38:18,293 --> 01:38:20,393
   - So what does that mean?

1078
01:38:31,071 --> 01:38:34,107
  - The Ghost says that Bashir
    has insulted the honour
         of his family.

1079
01:38:34,109 --> 01:38:37,911
   For a young man, a former
 student, this is a great sin.

1080
01:38:47,054 --> 01:38:50,356
The Ghost says he has just given
 him five thousand US dollars.

1081
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:55,495
   He says this will satisfy
   the question of the money.

1082
01:39:02,002 --> 01:39:06,072
    The Ghost says yes, but
 the debt is not yet resolved.

1083
01:39:19,421 --> 01:39:22,989
- This is so fucked up.

1084
01:39:22,991 --> 01:39:25,058
- Copy that.

1085
01:39:33,535 --> 01:39:36,302

did I not have this intel?

        to see his son.

1088
01:39:56,390 --> 01:39:59,692
'And so you shall'.

1089
01:40:13,607 --> 01:40:17,043
- Jesus! Three Niner Alpha, 66.
        I have a head.

1090
01:40:17,045 --> 01:40:20,246

     lying on the ground.

      Hotel Whiskey Kilo.

1092
01:40:25,720 --> 01:40:28,621

     BDK is going to react.

1093
01:40:28,623 --> 01:40:32,125
          Okay, look,
     they must not engage.
    - 66, Three Niner Alpha.

1094
01:40:32,127 --> 01:40:34,627
      What is BDK doing?
  Do you have hostile intent?

1095
01:40:39,600 --> 01:40:43,703
       - We got a weapon.
     - 66. Call sign Bravo
    Delta Kilo has a weapon.

       call sign Ghost.
     - Okay, light him up!

01:40:49,243 --> 01:40:52,278
   - 66, Golf Niner Whiskey.
    Do not take that shot!

1098
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:56,482
      - He has clearance!
- I'm overriding! 66, Golf Niner
Whiskey. You don't understand--

1099
01:40:56,484 --> 01:40:59,752
       - 66. I understand
       imminent threat--
  - Hit him, for fuck's sakes!

1100
01:40:59,754 --> 01:41:03,623
   - Am engaging. Wait out.
  - Confirm your dope. Up 23,

           right 2--
           - Roger.

1102
01:41:05,393 --> 01:41:08,094

please, do not take that shot--

1103
01:41:08,096 --> 01:41:10,396

   He doesn't need your okay!

01:41:10,398 --> 01:41:13,566
           - Standby.

1108
01:42:27,641 --> 01:42:30,776
- Niner Niner Tac, exfilling
now. All birds in escort.

1109
01:42:30,778 --> 01:42:34,147
   - 66, Golf Niner Whiskey.
     Do you have any idea
    what you've just done?

1110
01:42:34,149 --> 01:42:36,182
   - 66. Yeah, I think I do.

1111
01:42:36,184 --> 01:42:39,218
  I had imminent threat toward
   a civilian. I intervened.

1112
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:42,155
- Yeah, you did intervene, 66,
and you intervened in something
    you know nothing about!

- Back off, Mitchell.

      and I'll fight mine.

1115
01:42:50,732 --> 01:42:54,300
- I saved his life.

1116
01:42:54,302 --> 01:42:57,637
 - It wasn't yours to save! Now
he's got nothing! You understand
     that? He has nothing!

1117
01:42:57,639 --> 01:43:00,873
 - That's enough, Captain! This
  is my CP, you will back off.

1118
01:43:02,876 --> 01:43:05,878
       - Salaam Alaikum.

1119
01:43:07,514 --> 01:43:10,950

        - I don't know.

1120
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:14,387
    - Do you think he knows
    we just saved his bacon?

1121
01:43:14,389 --> 01:43:18,658
   - I think it might be more
     complicated than that.
             - How?

1122
01:43:18,660 --> 01:43:21,194
     What could possibly--

1123

- Fuck!

1124
01:43:27,968 --> 01:43:31,971
- The fuck did they come from?
- Guys from the safe house must
   have called for back-up.

1125

1134
01:44:03,638 --> 01:44:06,239
- Ma'am, they are at least 30
minutes out. They moved back
to escort Niner Niner Tac.

1135
01:44:06,241 --> 01:44:09,542
