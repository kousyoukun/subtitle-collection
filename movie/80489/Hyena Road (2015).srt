00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,256
- And I am your partner
in peace.

313
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,303
- So I need your eyes and ears
and I need you and your son

314
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,055
to be at our little
dedication ceremony,

315
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,431
how many clicks, there, Shorty?

316
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,059
- 15, sir.
- 15 clicks of hardtop

317
00:21:50,184 --> 00:21:51,477
into the Horn.

318
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,855
Your presence there
would be... very meaningful.

319
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,610
(foreign language)

320
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:07,326
- Hyena Road is a gift
to all Afghans.

321
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,496
It would be an honour
for my father and I

322
00:22:10,621 --> 00:22:11,914
to attend your ceremony.

323
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,334
- Out-fucking-standing.

324
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,172
- Thank you, general.
- Thank you, sir.

325
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:36,939
- Look at the little prick.
He's like Caligula.

326
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,984
It'd be a fuck of a lot easier
to get Hyena built

327
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:41,652
if that prick
would stop breathing.

328
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,280
- Right there, you're right.
I'm gonna hop a flight.

329
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,824
I wanna get to Sper,
run down a lead on an elder.

330
00:22:46,949 --> 00:22:48,450
Tell Armstrong I'll call in
from the FOB.

331
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,619
- You don't want
to hang out with me?

332
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,038
- Oh, you know there is nothing
I'd rather do

333
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,665
but the future
of Western civilization

334
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,959
depends on my ass
getting out to Sper.

335
00:23:07,428 --> 00:23:09,388
(rhythmic Arabic music)

336
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,770
<i>(man): Alexander the Great
marched into this graveyard</i>

337
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,396
<i>about 2,500 years ago.</i>

338
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:04,026
<i>Easy to march in,
hard to march out. His words.</i>

339
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,278
<i>He and his mother wrote
to each other all the time.</i>

340
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,530
One day, he got a letter from
her saying,

341
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,700
"What the hell? You conquered most
of the known world in a day and a half,

342
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,328
what are you doing
bogged down in Afghanistan?"

343
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,455
- He grabbed a bag
and shoveled it full of dirt

344
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,249
and had it sent back to Greece
with a message to his mother,

345
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,835
"Take this dirt and
dump it around the palace,

346
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:23,128
see what happens."

347
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,756
- 6-1, taking fire,
left, 1O o'clock.

348
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,216
300 metres, breaking right.

349
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:29,677
(indistinct radio
communication)

350
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,059
(gunfire)

351
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,727
<i>- Clear to engage.</i>

352
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:51,281
<i>Target is neutralized.
- Roger.</i>

353
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,825
<i>(man): So Alexander's mother</i>

354
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,618
<i>spread the dirt
all around the palace.</i>

355
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,620
<i>Later that night, a couple
of attendants showed up</i>

356
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,038
<i>to make sure she was alright.</i>

357
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,374
<i>One says, "Go ahead, after you."</i>

358
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,126
<i>And the other says,
"No, after you."</i>

359
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,461
<i>And the first one says,
"No, I insist."</i>

360
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,214
<i>And the second one says,
"Don't you tell me what to do."</i>

361
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,882
<i>They pull their swords
and go at it</i>

362
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,843
<i>till they kill each other.</i>

363
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:12,428
<i>Alexander's mother
watched all this</i>

364
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:16,765
<i>and wrote a note to him saying,
"Okay, okay, now I get it."</i>

365
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,769
<i>And he wrote back saying,
"Even the dirt is hostile."</i>

366
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,398
<i>In Afghanistan, dogs fight dogs,</i>

367
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,068
<i>birds fight birds, men kill men.</i>

368
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,528
- Fire!

369
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,783
(mixed chatter)

370
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,662
- Oh, man, come on,
show me their picture.

371
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:47,880
- Mind if I join you?
- Not at all, Warrant. Please.

372
00:25:58,891 --> 00:26:00,851
Hey, I got an update
from the engineer

373
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,436
on that stretch of Hyena
from yesterday.

374
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:04,772
They cleared 8 lEDs in all.

375
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,523
Something went wrong
with the last one.

376
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,319
The guy lost his leg above the knee.
They airlifted him to Landstuhl.

377
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,823
I think we need to talk.
- Hey, uh...

378
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,201
Hi, Jen.
Sorry to interrupt here.

379
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:18,660
Ryan, I'm Pete Mitchell,

380
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,204
one of the effects guys
with Brigade.

381
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:23,123
I don't mean to wreck
your meal, but you mind

382
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,167
if I have a word with you?
- Sure.

383
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,586
Catch up to you later.

384
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:37,888
- I was in the TOC
where you guys

385
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,598
had that engagement
in Haji Babe.

386
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,226
You were fucking lucky.

387
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,897
- You come all the way
out here to tell me that?

388
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,315
- Nope.

389
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:52,027
No, I came out here because -
and I could be

390
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,196
way out of line here but... -
you know, manifestly,

391
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,240
you and Jen got
a little something going.

392
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,201
On behalf
of the entire battle group,

393
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,495
I'd just like to express
our collective fucking jealousy!

394
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,539
(laughing)

395
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,749
- You got a girl?

396
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,836
- Yeah. Woman of my dreams,
back home.

397
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,048
- Does she know what you do?
- My wife? No.

398
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,425
She thinks I work
inside the wire

399
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,470
and I'm gonna leave it that way.
Let her sleep easy at night.

400
00:27:21,932 --> 00:27:23,934
Tell me something.

401
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,645
How much you do you know
about Pashtunwali?

402
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:30,274
- Whatever's in the handbook,
you know.

403
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,735
It's a tribal code. It's old.
- Oh yeah.

404
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:37,656
It's so old they look upon Islam
as a kind of recent add-on.

405
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,161
- What are those?
- They're dates.

406
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,538
They're local.
They help you shit.

407
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,331
(Ryan laughs)

408
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,712
The code has got
a bunch of, uh...

409
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:53,672
Well, they call them pillars.

410
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,924
And one of them is Panah,

411
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,594
which means... protection,
more or less. So when that elder

412
00:27:58,719 --> 00:28:01,054
invited you into his home,
he gave you Panah:

413
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,098
no harm could come to you.

414
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,311
- Uh... so I owe him, you mean?

415
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:09,771
- Well, he did it for Allah,
didn't do it for you.

416
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,857
But you're still breathing,
so that'd be your call.

417
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:17,112
This elder...

418
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,698
He speak any English?

419
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:23,493
- No. Just a couple words.

420
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,538
- Any marks about him,
any scars?

421
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,917
- No, but he had weird eyes.
- Weird how?

422
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,628
- His left eye was brown
and his right eye was deep blue.

423
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,922
- Hmm.

424
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,259
- So who is this guy?
Why do you...

425
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,803
Why did he give me this Panah?

426
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,722
- That's what I wanna know.

427
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:47,184
I got a patrol going back
into the village in the morning.

428
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:49,019
I'd really like if you'd come
along with me,

429
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,021
help me ID the guy.

430
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:55,025
- Yeah, sure, I'll be there.
- 0900.

431
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,818
- Alright.
- Alright.

432
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,737
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,494
(soft music)

434
00:29:38,402 --> 00:29:41,071
(chatter in the distance)

435
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,574
(Jen): What are you thinking?
(Ryan): Hmm...

436
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,203
I'm thinking
about our hotel room in Cyprus.

437
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,796
- Urn...

438
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,384
Okay, I'm gonna say something,

439
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,637
and I say it for both of us
and it's going to be shitty.

440
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:08,640
It's gotta be said.

441
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,478
- Fuck me.
- You know that I am

442
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,440
completely crazy about you,
and Cyprus was...

443
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,822
Cyprus was perfect.

444
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,492
We're perfect.

445
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,619
But we can't keep doing this,
we both know that.

446
00:30:31,455 --> 00:30:33,623
If we get caught,
I'm gonna get cashiered.

447
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:35,959
This is my career.
- It's mine too.

448
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:39,129
- I know,
this is what I'm saying.

449
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,131
When we... rotate home,
we'll see.

450
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,216
But right now, while we're here,
it's got to stop.

451
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,181
(Ryan sighs)
- So this is it?

452
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,058
(sighs)

453
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:52,851
- I think it has to be.

454
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,528
- This is like
fucking Armageddon.

455
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,072
- I know.

456
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,370
You know there's nothing
that I would rather do right now

457
00:31:11,495 --> 00:31:14,373
than climb over there and
fraternize the shit out of you.

458
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,876
- Hmm...

459
00:31:19,628 --> 00:31:21,254
You can't dump me
in one sentence

460
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:23,340
then say something like that
in the next.

461
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,634
(sighs)

462
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,724
Ah...!

463
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,449
(soft Arabic music)

464
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,752
(orders in foreign language,
muffled)

465
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:14,891
(man): Now, when we get
to the grape fields, if you see wire,

466
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,018
you see metal, you see plastic,

467
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,563
newly turned dirt,
don't step on 'em.

468
00:32:19,688 --> 00:32:21,815
You didn't drop it,
don't pick it up.

469
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,942
Try to stay
at least five body lengths

470
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,902
between the next man
in the patrol.

471
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,529
When we get in the village,

472
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,489
you're gonna see women
dressed in bags.

473
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,866
Please don't stare at them.

474
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:33,618
I know you've probably seen that
in Toronto or Paris,

475
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,871
but you haven't seen it here.

476
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,831
Here, those bags are like
magnets for your eyes.

477
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,959
If you get caught staring at
them, it'll fuck shit up for us.

478
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,382
Quick clot, tourniquet, bandage.

479
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,259
- I don't know how to use
any of that.

480
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,346
- Ma'am, if it has to be used,
it won't be you using it.

481
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,933
(rhythmic music)

482
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,310
(indistinct chatter)

483
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,853
(Arabic)

484
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:46,983
(man): Hey! Eyes!

485
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,865
(Arabic)

486
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,287
- In my job,
it is a great honour

487
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,705
to meet elders such as yourself.

488
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,832
Today, I meet you,
so it's a good day.

489
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,669
But I was hoping to meet
another elder in this village.

490
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:08,838
(translating)

491
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,428
(foreign language)

492
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,561
- He says that, "I'm the only
elder, and there is no other."

493
00:34:22,686 --> 00:34:25,605
- Strange. Someone told me
there was another important man

494
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,774
that lived in this village,
but I forget his name.

495
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,943
But this person said you
couldn't forget him

496
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,903
because he had two different
coloured eyes.

497
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,408
(translating)

498
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,919
(shouting)

499
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,338
- Hey, hey, hey!
What's in your head?

500
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,631
You're too high.

501
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,466
You can see the women
without their bags.

502
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,261
Get down! Get down!
- Sorry, sir.

503
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:57,971
- I think you know who I mean.

504
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,639
(foreign language)

505
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,057
- He says he's a ghost.

506
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,809
- Even ghosts
have to live somewhere.

507
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,271
(translating)

508
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,524
(foreign language)

509
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,530
- He says most of them
live in Kandahar City.

510
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,503
(coughing)

511
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,466
- Haji, what the fuck
are you doing?

512
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,052
- The carpets, they are dusty!

513
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,847
- The entire country is dusty.
(Cleaner laughing)

514
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,850
Come on, let's have some tea.
Step into my office.

515
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,853
- How are you doing, Pete?
How's your family?

516
00:35:47,729 --> 00:35:49,689
How's your time?
- It's good.

517
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,774
And how's yours?

518
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:53,610
You heard from Kabul?
When will you see 'em?

519
00:35:53,735 --> 00:35:55,445
- Soon.
(Arabic)

520
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,946
(Pete clears throat)

521
00:35:57,781 --> 00:35:58,948
- You're frowning.

522
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,743
(Cleaner sighing)
- I thought you were crazy,

523
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,412
but I was wrong,
and I don't like to be wrong.

524
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,289
My cousin says maybe he is here.

525
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,333
- In K-City?
- He thinks so.

526
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:09,959
Why is he back?

527
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,005
- If it's even him.
- But the eyes!

528
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,135
- If it is him, do you think you
can get me to see him?

529
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,638
- My uncle has arranged it
for tomorrow.

530
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,599
- Tell them I'm gonna
bring along another guy,

531
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,518
the master sniper
with the battle group.

532
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:28,228
- One other thing.
It's not relational.

533
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,689
- Related.
- Related, yes.

534
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,149
I'm hearing something
about an attack.

535
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,359
- In K-City?
- Soon.

536
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,111
That's all I know.
As soon as I

537
00:36:36,236 --> 00:36:37,737
find out more,
I will tell you.

538
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,197
<i>_</i> Qkay-

539
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,742
How are you?
Do you need anything?

540
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,160
- No, I'm good.

541
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,829
- You always say you're good.

542
00:36:45,954 --> 00:36:47,872
- I'm Afghan!
(foreign language)

543
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,708
(laughing)

544
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,960
- Oh, listen, I got you...

545
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,797
I got you some of that shampoo,

546
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,801
some of that... hand cream
you guys are so crazy about.

547
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,011
(laughing)

548
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,015
- Thank you. This is great.
- You're welcome, my friend.

549
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:08,518
- It's my favourite.

550
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,769
(laughing)

551
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,897
- Guys, listen up, this is
straight from the brass.

552
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,441
Guys! Listen! Alright.

553
00:37:14,566 --> 00:37:19,028
No more fraternizing with goats,
you bunch of goat fuckers!

554
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:20,405
(knocking on door)
- Okay, listen up.

555
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,781
All four DETs are out tonight,

556
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,117
all ops are observe and report,
except for you, Travis.

557
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,910
You guys are on that bend
in Hyena

558
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,204
where that fucking tree is,
so keep your eyes peeled.

559
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,541
I've been seconded to intel
for the day,

560
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,460
so I'm heading into K-City.

561
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:35,754
Wilf here is going to step up.

562
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:38,381
(applause, cheering)

563
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,051
Alright. I got some bad news.

564
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:44,053
They grabbed a couple of guys

565
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:45,805
from 10th Mountain
Dog Company.

566
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,140
- What?
- Yeah.

567
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,643
I don't know the details, but
there was an IED of some sort

568
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,645
and the Talis grabbed
two of them.

569
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:55,648
- Are they alive?

570
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,275
- Yeah.

571
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,738
(long hiss)

572
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:03,281
- Fuck!
(clattering)

573
00:38:06,451 --> 00:38:08,411
You can blow me up
with an IED...

574
00:38:09,579 --> 00:38:13,124
shoot me with an AK,
fucking run me over with a LAV!

575
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,796
I'm... I'm fucking fine
with that.

576
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:20,590
But do not let me get
taken alive by these...

577
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,967
fucking medievalists.

578
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,387
- You good?

579
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,809
- What exactly
do they do to you?

580
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:33,186
- It's unspeakable.
- New comm logs!

581
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,480
Fill them out.
- What do you mean?

582
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:38,525
- Hey... Unspeakable means
we don't fucking speak about it.

583
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,333
(muffled gunshots)

584
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,592
(whispering): Targets down.
Let's back up.

585
00:39:15,645 --> 00:39:18,439
First time, well...
how do you feel?

586
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,732
- Good.

587
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,735
- Ready to go?
- No, not quite.

588
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:24,487
I gotta take a shit.
- What?! Why?

589
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,239
- Why? I don't know.
Maybe because my...

590
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,575
long intestine's full of shit?
Give me the bag.

591
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,536
Thanks.

592
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,210
(Hickey sighs)
- What a beautiful night.

593
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:44,173
You know, if they get this place
together, I'd come back.

594
00:39:44,299 --> 00:39:46,718
Bring Joey camping-
- Camping?

595
00:39:46,843 --> 00:39:48,761
- Yeah.
- In Kandahar?

596
00:39:50,013 --> 00:39:51,472
- Why the fuck not?

597
00:39:53,016 --> 00:39:57,395
- Number 2's fully offloaded.
Good to go.

598
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,816
- Three Niner Alpha.

599
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,612
This is 66 Bravo ready
for extraction. Over.

600
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,406
- Let's go, Wilf.

601
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,136
- It's a beautiful morning.
- Yeah, it's been for two hours.

602
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,846
How long until the convoy?

603
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,390
- Should be on the move,
five to ten Mikes maybe.

604
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,603
- These A&A dudes,
you trust these guys?

605
00:40:39,646 --> 00:40:41,522
- With my life.

606
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,733
It's their war.
We're just along for the ride.

607
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,818
(music playing from radio)
Hey, Walid.

608
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:47,695
- Huh?

609
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,114
- What's he got going
on the tunes?

610
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,285
(laughing)
- Leif Garrett.

611
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,328
- You're shitting me.
- Yeah.

612
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,163
- Come on, put it out,
for all to hear!

613
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,629
# <i>I never had no problems yeah</i> #

614
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:08,883

# <i>Somebody turned around
and shouted</i> #

623
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,248
# <i>Play that funky music
white boy</i> #

624
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,836
# <i>Play that funky music right</i> #

625
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,339
(indistinct radio communication)

626
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:54,345
Okay, convoy's on the move.
Mount up!

627
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,473
# <i>Till you die
till you die</i> #

628
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,768
(soulful Arabic music)

629
00:42:15,033 --> 00:42:17,535
Golf Niner Whisky,
we're pulling in. Over.

630
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,371
- <i>Roger that,
Golf Niner Whisky. Join in.</i>

631
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,005
(indistinct prayer,
foreign language)

632
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,679
(traffic sounds)

633
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,074
(barking)

634
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,994
(people chattering)

635
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,382
- Take this right.

636
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,097
- This is Golf Niner Whisky.
We're breaking off.

637
00:43:19,222 --> 00:43:20,431
Thanks for the tow.

638
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,016
- Pete, anywhere here.

639
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,238
(Ryan): Who is that guy?
(Pete): He's called the Cleaner.

640
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:38,324
He's the bravest man I've ever
known and my greatest ally.

641
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,618
He works for us
but can't be seen with us,

642
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,204
if you know what I mean.
His family's up in Kabul

643
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,706
and he hasn't seen them
or slept in the same bed

644
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:48,292
for more than three nights
running in the last two years.

645
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,378
- Why's he doing it?

646
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,257
- Love of country?
I honestly don't know.

647
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,593
Can't just be for the money
we pay him.

648
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,357
(foreign language)

649
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:15,463
(introductions
in foreign language)

650
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,430
(foreign language)

651
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,182
(Walid): He says his name
is Mohammed.

652
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,394
- Yeah, of course it is.
This bread looks very good.

653
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,979
(Walid translates.)

654
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,564
(Pete sighing)

655
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:38,110
My friend Ryan,
we've been friends,

656
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:40,821
we've known each other
and loved each other

657
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:42,323
for many, many years.

658
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,825
And you helped my friend
in the village of Haji Baba.

659
00:45:44,951 --> 00:45:47,370
(Walid translates.)

660
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,794
And I would like to repay you
for that kindness.

661
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,545
You must need something,

662
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,632
perhaps new prayer rugs
for your mosque.

663
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,677
I would like to help with that.
(Walid translates.)

664
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,268
- How much is that?
- I have no idea.

665
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,646
This is for your village.

666
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,065
(Walid translates.)

667
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,783
(foreign language)

668
00:46:28,286 --> 00:46:30,538
- He says, "Only a fool
accepts a gift

669
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:32,415
without knowing
what it's for."

670
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,791
(chuckling)

671
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,504
- There is a legendary warrior,

672
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,548
a mujahideen in the Jihad
against the Soviets.

673
00:46:40,673 --> 00:46:42,717
He was called
the Lion of the Desert.

674
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:45,011
(Walid translates.)

675
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,521
(foreign language)

676
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,024
- He says
he's heard of this man.

677
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:02,361
- The word is that he's back.
He's once again mujahid.

678
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,905
Have you heard anything
about these rumours?

679
00:47:05,031 --> 00:47:07,199
(Walid translates.)

680
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,086
May I ask where you're from?

681
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,588
(Walid translates.)

682
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,425
(foreign language)

683
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,554
- He says his village is called
Abdullah Jan.

684
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,348
- Ah. So you're Pakistani.

685
00:47:30,473 --> 00:47:32,183
(Walid translates.)

686
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,479
(foreign language)

687
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:46,572
- I have been Pakistani
for many years,

688
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,408
a Muslim for 1,400
and a Pashtun for 5,000.

689
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,329
- I understand.
(Walid translates.)

690
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:58,084
If you hear anything
about the Lion...

691
00:47:58,751 --> 00:48:00,127
I would greatly appreciate it.

692
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,880
(Walid translates.)

693
00:48:09,929 --> 00:48:12,598
(foreign language)

694
00:48:18,521 --> 00:48:19,605
- So he's Pakistani?

695
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,774
- No.

696
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,652
No, that was just
a kind of test.

697
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:27,780
Abdullah Jan is just the ruins
of some village

698
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,907
across the border
from Spin Boldak.

699
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,325
Nobody's really lived there

700
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,620
for a couple hundred years,
least of all him.

701
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,123
- So he's not just some guy
from a village.

702
00:48:37,248 --> 00:48:38,874
- No, he's not.

703
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,045
He's the Lion of the Desert.
That's what his people call him.

704
00:48:48,134 --> 00:48:50,928
But the Russians,
they called him the Ghost

705
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,847
'cause they couldn't kill him.

706
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,434
They shot him four times,
they blew him up twice.

707
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:00,855
And each time, his guys would
get him up over the mountains

708
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,274
and into the Red Cross tents
in Pakistan.

709
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,568
And they'd get him stitched up

710
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:08,779
and he'd be back out there
blowing Russians out of the sky.

711
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,286
We just met a very big gun,

712
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:17,621
like a Rommel or a Patton.

713
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,250
This guy beat the Red Army
and he was a kid when he did it.

714
00:49:23,169 --> 00:49:26,839
When the Russians pulled out,
he cut a deal with the Talibans,

715
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,009
"I'm going back to my grape
fields, I don't want any part

716
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:32,761
of your stupid civil war.
Just leave me alone."

717
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:36,098
Which they did,
which was kind of weird,

718
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,475
'cause generally speaking,

719
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,852
the Talis went after anybody
who stood against them.

720
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,605
But him, for some reason,
they just left him alone.

721
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,485
(Ryan): But now he's back.
- He's back,

722
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,528
and I gotta figure out why.
A guy like him,

723
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,863
with his influence,
he could prob--

724
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,700
(explosion)
(deafening noise)

725
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,121
(people shouting, crying)

726
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,048
(men moaning)

727
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,634
- We got multiple bombers,
vehicle-borne and coordinated.

728
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:12,760
- Reporting civilian casualties,

729
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:14,720
multiple civ KIA, city centre...

730
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,805
- Got a VBIED
southwest Kandahar City.

731
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,390
Multiple casualties.

732
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:21,769
- A&A reports taking fire,
I-route 1 and Alpha 7-5.

733
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:23,187
(grunting)

734
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:24,897
- Must have hit
the engine block.

735
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,317
<i>- Goddamn“.
- Peter, wheres the convoy'?</i>

736
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,861
- We lost the convoy.
- Alright...

737
00:50:32,196 --> 00:50:34,740
(coughing)
Zero, Golf Niner Whisky, uh...

738
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,534
I have contact. Over.
- Zero, acknowledged.

739
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:38,494
- Yeah, Golf Niner Whisky,
we have contact

740
00:50:38,619 --> 00:50:42,706
<i>at grid Quebec Romeo 232-129.
We have no mil casualties.</i>

741
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,750
<i>I have mobility kill. Over.</i>

742
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,794
- Zero, roger. Be advised
we have reports

743
00:50:46,919 --> 00:50:48,254
of multiple SBVIED
in vicinity

744
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,130
of police headquarters.
More to follow.

745
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:51,799
- <i>Golf</i> Niner <i>Whisky, send.</i>
- <i>Yeah, it looks like</i>

746
00:50:51,924 --> 00:50:54,385
<i>the Talis are at it again.
It's a shit storm out there.</i>

747
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,011
I advise you try and exit city,

748
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,138
move to Camp Nathan Smith,
ride this one out.

749
00:50:58,264 --> 00:50:59,932
- Golf Niner Whisky.
Wilco. Out.

750
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,642
(Ryan): There's another
explosion! Let's go!

751
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,519
- We're gonna have to move.
Heading north.

752
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:06,397
Goddamnit, can't get the radio.

753
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,065
- Forget the radio,
we'll use my MBITR.

754
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,901
Let's go! We gotta move!

755
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,287
- I'm gonna have to blow it.
- Walid?

756
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,998
- Yeah.
- Come! Behind the car.

757
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,211
- Frag out!

758
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,801
(siren blaring)

759
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,387
- Mitchell, grab Walid.
Punch up to that corner.

760
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,723
Cover my 6.
- Roger. Stay with me.

761
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:45,269
Clear.

762
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,814
(boy whistling)
Dick.

763
00:51:52,276 --> 00:51:54,111
- Let's go.
(distant shouting)

764
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:59,366
(Pete): They're moving
on the fucking rooftops.

765
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,368
(panting)

766
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,457
- Clear, let's go.

767
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,335
(shot fired)

768
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:12,338
- RPG!

769
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,009
(panting)
<i>'</i> YOU good?

770
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,969

(foreign mnguage)
(gunfire)

772
00:52:22,014 --> 00:52:25,017
- Can you shoot?
- Me? Fuck no, I'm intel.

773
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,898
- Zero, Golf Niner Whisky.
I have PID on multiple hostiles,

774
00:52:31,023 --> 00:52:33,776
40 metres east of last position.
Engaging. Wait out.

775
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:34,860

776
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,821

778

Five suicide bombers,
a rack of RPGs,

17 dead and 37 wounded.

- Yeah. Police headquarters.
We just got caught up in it.

822

That is Kandahar karma,
baby, that's what that is.

But I gotta say,
you handle your rifle

like you got ice in your veins.

- Well, those Talis
were using AKs,

No, everybody knows the rules.
You pick up an AK, an RPG,

you're gonna hear about it.
There's no gray area.

834
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,981
- Well, except back home,
where they think what you do

835
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,609
is a little too... I don't
know... premeditated.

836
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:46,486
But my shit? Hearts and Minds?
They lap that stuff up

837

a moral ring to it,

even if it's mostlyjust PR.

839

- You believe that?

840
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,037
- These people here...

841
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,248
they got no use
for what we have on offer.

842
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,209
They don't want Justin Bieber
and Tom Jefferson

843
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:02,628
and our fucking pornography.

844
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,715
They just want our money
and a little bit of stability.

845
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,927
- So how do we win?
- There is no winning.

846
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,554
There's just an end state
and that's gonna get laid down

by foreign policy, not by us.

848
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,183
- You're a cynical man.

849
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,186
- Not about this country,
I'm not.

850
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:21,063
Not about these people.

851

853
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:29,154
just one bullet
in the right place,

854
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,989
I could change everything.

Don't say anything,
just listen.

00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,734
I know our situation,
I know it doesn't make sense,

862
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,611
but you need to hear this
from me.

863
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,071
I love you.

864

Right down to the bone,
right down to the goddamned

- Haji, what are you doing?
- Cleaning the chairs.

868
00:58:30,257 --> 00:58:32,259
- It's not your job.
- Whose job is it?

869
00:58:32,384 --> 00:58:33,385
- Well, it's nobody's.

870
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,054
- This is why you have
dirty chairs!

871
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,016
(sighing)
- I need some tea. Come on.

872
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,643
Why would he even agree
to a meeting

873
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,186
if he has absolutely nothing
to say?

874
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,522
- Maybe he just wants the
Coalition to know he's back.

875
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,608
- Maybe, but for what?

876
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,070
We need to know
who's in that village.

877
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,697
Can you get
into the Tazkera Registry,

878
00:58:53,822 --> 00:58:55,032
find out who lives there?

879
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,618
- I have an uncle, he works
in the Governor's palace.

880
00:58:58,744 --> 00:59:00,871
- God, how many uncles
do you have?

881
00:59:00,996 --> 00:59:03,248
- Pff. Many.

882

Tell me...

883
00:59:06,752 --> 00:59:10,172
What do you think of my hair?
I've been using the shampoo.

884
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,508
- It looks silky smooth
and very manageable.

885
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,886
- Ah! And my hands?
- Hmm...

886

Any events in the last,
I don't know,

893
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,173
say the last six months?
- Come on, Pete--

894
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,259
- I know I should go through Armstrong,
but I don't know what I'm looking for.

895
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,054
I don't feel like doing a whole
work up just on a hunch.

896
00:59:59,179 --> 01:00:01,890
- You want a visual, I assume.
- Anything with eyes, yeah.

897
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,391
- I'll let you know.

898
01:00:05,185 --> 01:00:06,853
- Thank you.

899
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,923
- Anything useful?

900
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,842
- Maybe.

901
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:38,885
What do I owe you?
- I'll take your beer allotment

902
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,638
at the end of the month.
- I only get two, same as you.

903
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,641
- And I'll take them both.
- Alright, they're yours.

904
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,645
And you can clear all this
shit off. Thanks, Chewey.

905
01:00:51,106 --> 01:00:53,733
Oh yeah, and, uh...
one of these days,

906
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,444
I'm gonna split up

01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,108
- <i>How's Joey?
(Mary): He's good, you know.</i>

936
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,735
<i>Report card's off the charts.</i>

937
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,321
<i>But he misses the shit
out of you.</i>

938
01:03:44,446 --> 01:03:47,198
(laughing)
- Oh, come on, honestly.

939
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,701
He really misses me?
- <i>Of</i> course he misses you!

940
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,286
<i>Fuck, I miss you.</i>

941
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:52,662
(sighing)

942
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:56,916
- I miss <i>you too,</i> baby.
<i>- How much do you miss me?</i>

943
01:03:57,042 --> 01:03:59,169
- Wide-open prairie miss you.

944
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,670
(Mary sighing)

945
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:04,549
- <i>What about these?
You miss them?</i>

946
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,928
- Oh, Jesus, you have no idea
how much I miss them.

947
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,682
Hang on...

948
01:04:35,497 --> 01:04:37,332
- I had to go back because
this op

949
01:04:37,457 --> 01:04:39,959
was pretty early in the roto.
But yeah, the DETs observed

950
01:04:40,085 --> 01:04:42,253
between 15 and 20 Talis
moving across the field.

951
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,756
Because of the force size,
they didn't engage.

952
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,466
Company command requested
the grid.

953
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,676
They called it in, artillery
beat the shit out of them.

954
01:04:48,802 --> 01:04:50,720
- There was some fast air
in there as well, right?

955
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,180
- Yeah, I believe so.
Two A10s.

956
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,517
- And they destroyed the field?
- That's what Warthogs do.

957
01:04:55,642 --> 01:04:58,770
- Well, see, this matters
because, as it turns out,

958
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,731
the field is owned
by Bashir Daoud Khan.

959
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,149
- BDK?

960
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,778
- See, BDK leases the field to
the farmer, who's basically...

961
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,239
He's like a slave, right?

962
01:05:09,364 --> 01:05:10,532
The farmer works the field,

963
01:05:10,657 --> 01:05:12,617
then at the end
of the poppy season,

964
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,619
he's gotta hand over 5,000 USD.

965
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,205
Whatever he gets
on top of that, he gets to keep,

966
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,623
which is probably like
800 bucks,

967
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,958
somewhere around
the national average.

968
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:21,835
Now in this particular case,

969
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,462
the Talis go running around
the field,

970
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,340
ISAF blows the shit out of it

971
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,592
and the crop is ruined.
And now, well, the farmer,

972
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,469
he's got less than Adam
before the apple.

973
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,764
Well, BDK shows up and goes,
"Hello, where's my 5,000 USD?"

974
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,559
And the farmer says, "Well...
the crop was ruined, you know?

975
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:39,227
No fault of my own."

976
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:43,022
BDK says, "I don't give a shit,
I'm evil. I will have my $5,000.

977
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:45,733
And you have X amount
of time to come up with it."

978
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:48,194
- Wow, this guy sounds like
Tony Soprano.

979
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,947
- Yeah, but without
the therapist.

980
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,866
- We Afghans,
we're not very big on therapy.

981
01:05:52,991 --> 01:05:56,453
(laughing)
- Alright, so why are we looking

982
01:05:56,578 --> 01:05:58,621
at this farmer?
- His name is Abdul Malik.

983
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,375
His father's name is Haji Malik,
Lion of the Desert.

984
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,588
- His father is the Ghost?
Holy shit!

985
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:08,673
- We think this is why
the Ghost has returned,

986
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,341
to protect
the honour of his family.

987
01:06:10,467 --> 01:06:12,343
- There's some bad history
between BDK and the Ghost.

988
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,971
I don't want things to go
haywire 'cause I want the Ghost,

989
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,057
I want him to work with us,
'cause he can be a powerful ally

990
01:06:18,183 --> 01:06:20,018
for what we're trying
to achieve down here,

991
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:21,644
maybe we'll actually
get Hyena built.

992
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,354
- So where do I fit in?

993
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,773
- Well, we think the date
for payment is close, yeah?

994
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:28,693
Two-three days kinda thing.
So I need eyes on that village,

995
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,904
I need to know
about the comings and goings,

996
01:06:31,029 --> 01:06:33,239
the who, the what,
all that kind of thing.

997
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,618
- I got my snipers spread
all over the area of operation,

998
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,870
but I can redeploy,
rotate the DETs,

999
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,873
two days on, two days off
sort of thing, starting tonight.

1000
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,833
- Outstanding!

1001
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,380
- You ever try a date?
- No, thank you.

(laughter)

1060
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,378

and I've always been,

01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,088
ever since I was a kid.

1062
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,341
It might've been irresponsible
to put a weapon in my hand,

1063
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:03,718
but people would get
hunting licences,

1064
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:05,136
they didn't even have a gun,

1065
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,263
just so that I could hunt
on their behalf.

1066
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,640
I used to shoot
hard-to-shoot game,

1067
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:12,351
put food on people's tables
when times were hard.

- We're on.

Get everyone up.
- Roger.

1081
01:12:06,614 --> 01:12:11,035
- Holy shit. 66 Bravo, we got
two VIPs exiting the vehicle.

1082
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,789
First 40s, black hair,
bad dye job, beady little eyes.

1083
01:12:14,914 --> 01:12:17,166
- Can he confirm VIP is BDK?

1084
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,045
- 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha,
is VIP BDK? Can you confirm?

1085
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,713
- 66 Bravo confirming.

1086
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:26,050
VIP call sign Bravo Delta Kilo.

1087
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,553
Second civ Hamid Walid Khan,

1088
01:12:28,678 --> 01:12:30,972
call sign Hotel Whisky Kilo.

1089
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,768
Three Niner Alpha,
this is 66 Bravo.

1090
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,938
We've got Taliban,
counting four.

1091
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,232
- He's got Talis with him?

1092
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,359
- A guy like BDK plays
both sides of the fence.

1093
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,570
- 66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha,
do you have clearance?

1094
01:12:45,695 --> 01:12:46,654
Are they carrying weapons?

1095
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,072
- Wednesdays-Fridays
he's with us,

1096
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,740
Tuesdays-Thursdays,
he's with the Talis,

1097
01:12:49,866 --> 01:12:52,076
and on days off,
they're both running narcotics.

1098
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,744
- <i>66 Bravo,</i>

1099
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:56,747
negative, no weapons,
but they're in costume.

1100
01:12:56,873 --> 01:12:59,000
Black turbans, black man jams.

1101
01:12:59,125 --> 01:13:02,461
These guys are not even trying
to hide who they are. Over.

1102
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,589
(chicken cackling)

1103
01:13:14,015 --> 01:13:16,017
(girl screaming)

1104
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,688
(rhythmic music)

1105
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,276
66 Bravo, we have hostile action
against civilians.

1106
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,737
- Three Niner Alpha,
clarify "hostile action".

1107
01:13:27,862 --> 01:13:30,573
- They're taking kids.
Little girls.

1108
01:13:30,698 --> 01:13:32,658
- Three Niner Alpha, do you have
imminent threat, over?

1109
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,619
- 66 Bravo, negative,

1110
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,287
<i>but they are grabbing
little girls</i>

1111
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,039
<i>and dragging them
to their trucks.</i>

1112
01:13:38,164 --> 01:13:40,499
(girl screaming)
(BDK shouting)

1113
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,668
(man groaning)

1114
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:49,091
(foreign language)
(girl crying)

1115
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,303
Authorized to engage? I am
getting ready to take the shot.

1116
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,055
- No, I'm stepping in.

1117
01:13:55,056 --> 01:13:58,809
66 Bravo, this is Golf Niner
Whisky. Sit tight, over.

1118
01:13:58,935 --> 01:13:59,936
- The fuck?! Take them down!

1119
01:14:00,061 --> 01:14:03,147
- Unless they pull out weapons,
we can't get involved.

1120
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,651
- 66 Bravo, I can intervene.
- Golf Niner Whisky, negative.

1121
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:08,611
Unless you see a weapon,
do not intervene.

1122
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:11,822
- 66 Bravo, they are taking
little kids.

1123
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,991
<i>- Golf Niner Whisky, sit tight.</i>

1124
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,869
- 66 Bravo, clarify.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1125
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:20,164
- Golf Niner Whisky, unless you
see a weapon, do not engage.

1126
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,208
- We gotta do something!
- Your guys will stand down.

1127
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:25,461
- Jesus Christ!
- Settle down, Warrant! Fuck.

1128
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,885
- F...uck.

1129
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,771
- You're out of line, here!
- Why didn't you override?

1130
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,439
- 'Cause it's an intel op,
it's their call!

1131
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,774
Rules of engagement.
You know that!

1132
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,777
- It's a fucking crime!
- We need to talk.

1133
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,989
- No, you know what?
We're good, we're good. Hey, Mitchell!

1134
01:14:53,114 --> 01:14:55,950
Mitchell, what are those girls,
like 8, 10 years old, huh?

1135
01:14:56,075 --> 01:14:58,619
And we just stand there? What's
gonna happen to them, huh?

1136
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,579
- They're gonna be sold,
that's what's gonna happen.

1137
01:15:00,705 --> 01:15:02,540
BDK will hand them over
to the Talis,

1138
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,500
the Talis will put them
on the market.

1139
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,460
Whatever they get above
5, they're gonna keep,

1140
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,380
but BDK will get his $5,000.
And then I don't know,

1141
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,631
they're gonna end up in...

1142
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,383
some shitty marriage
in Dubai, or worse,

1143
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,011
they're gonna end up sucking
dick in some brothel

1144
01:15:15,136 --> 01:15:16,303
outside of Fort McMurray.

1145
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:18,514
- You know this
and we don't intervene?

1146
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,350
- We didn't intervene because
we didn't have imminent threat.

1147
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,269
Those are the rules
of engagement!

1148
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,396
I had to make that call!

1149
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,606
We didn't intervene because
BDK is protected by a roof

1150
01:15:27,732 --> 01:15:30,568
on top of which is a great
big fucking sign that reads CIA!

1151
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:33,279
He's their asset. Now, you wanna
bring down our general

1152
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,197
and fuck up
the entire battle group?

1153
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,241
Be my guest, go ahead,
shoot him.

1154
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,326
- What kind of fucking war
are we fighting here?!

1155
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:40,995
- Oh, come on, it's not one war!

1156
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:42,663
It's a whole bunch
of different wars.

1157
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,540
And mine,
it's like a 3D chess game.

1158
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,208
Half the time, I don't even know

1159
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,835
who the fuck
I'm playing against.

1160
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,754
- We're not playing games here!

1161
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,424
- No, we're not.

1162
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,968
But we're not here
so kids can fly kites either.

1163
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,012
- Then what the fuck
are we doing here?

1164
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,555
- We are rolling back the clock

1165
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,849
and we are stacking the deck
so this time,

1166
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,642
the complete fucking
crazies don't win.

1167
01:16:03,768 --> 01:16:06,562
Haji, did you get all of that?
- Yes, the relay was clear.

1168
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:13,903
He's going to have to react.
He will make badal.

1169
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,449
- Okay, bada/ is another
one of those tribal pillars.

1170
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,284
Come on, sit down.

1171
01:16:22,787 --> 01:16:24,121
Sit down.

1172
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,877
Bada/ basically means, like...
revenge, or...

1173
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,921
It's like an eye for an eye
kinda thing.

1174
01:16:32,046 --> 01:16:33,089
- It's more about honour.

1175
01:16:33,214 --> 01:16:36,592
If the leader of the family
cannot restore honour to them,

1176
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,302
then he must leave, forever.

1177
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,262
So the Ghost has no choice.
He must act.

1178
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,305
- Here's the thing.

1179
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,767
BDK served under the Ghost
in the war against the Russians.

1180
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:47,103
Story goes that a Russian
chopper went down

1181
01:16:47,228 --> 01:16:50,356
and BDK ass-raped one of the pilots.
And as punishment,

1182
01:16:50,481 --> 01:16:52,817
the Ghost embarrassed him
in front of the rest of the muj.

1183
01:16:52,942 --> 01:16:56,612
- So you see, <i>badal</i> continues.
- BDK is a bad guy

1184
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,239
and he needs
to be brought down.

1185
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:01,033
Now we can't do it,
but the Ghost can. To do that,

1186
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,785
we gotta boost the stature
of the Ghost,

1187
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,537
and we're gonna start
by inviting the Ghost

1188
01:17:04,662 --> 01:17:05,996
to the ceremony
for Hyena Road.

1189
01:17:06,122 --> 01:17:08,040
- Put them together.
<i>Badal</i> is possible.

1190
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,709
- I'm also gonna offer up
the safe house.

1191
01:17:10,835 --> 01:17:12,878
If they meet on Hyena Road,

1192
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,923
it's political. If they meet
at the safe house, it's personal.

1193
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,675
Either way,
there's gonna be fireworks.

1194
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:21,345
Okay, there's a flight heading back to KAF
in about 10-11 Mikes, I'm gonna hop on it.

1195
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,556
I need you to set up
a meeting with the Ghost,

1196
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:25,057
we'll do it at the safe house.

1197
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:27,518
And I need your team
to scope out security

1198
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,895
at the ceremony site
and at the safe house.

1199
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:33,524
Ryan...

1200
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,234
Ryan...

1201
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:40,573
Don't think I don't feel
for those girls, 'cause I do.

1202
01:17:40,698 --> 01:17:43,367
And we'll do what we can
to find them.

1203
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,872
But right now, in the bigger
picture, we need the Ghost.

1204
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:05,514
(chanting)
(buzzing sound)

1205
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:19,695
(foreign language)

1206
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,930
(rhythmic Oriental music)

1207
01:19:30,391 --> 01:19:31,809
(tires screeching)

1208
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:56,750
(foreign language)

1209
01:20:18,022 --> 01:20:19,815
(foreign language)

1210
01:20:28,032 --> 01:20:29,825
(knocking)

1211
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:35,914
- Travis said
you were looking for me.

1212
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:38,083
- Yeah...

1213
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,004
- Alright, look, I'm sorry,
I lost my shit.

1214
01:20:42,129 --> 01:20:43,797
(Ryan sighing)

1215
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,592
But you know me. And
you know that most of the time,

1216
01:20:46,717 --> 01:20:48,260
I'm proud about
what we do here

1217
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,721
and I'm proud about
how we go about doing it,

1218
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,556
but... those were kids.

1219
01:20:54,475 --> 01:20:56,977
If we can't help them, what's
the point of doing all this?

1220
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,230
- I don't... have an answer for
that, and for what it's worth,

1221
01:21:00,356 --> 01:21:02,441
I agree with you,
but that's not, um...

1222
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,485
what I wanted to see you about.

1223
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,864
Uh, do you mind just...
closing the door?

1224
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,499
Uh...
(mumbling)

1225
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,710
Have a seat, I just have
to show you something.

1226
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:25,714
(Jennifer sighs)

1227
01:21:38,519 --> 01:21:39,895
- What's this?

1228
01:21:41,522 --> 01:21:43,315
- Uh, that's our baby.

1229
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,319
It was... Cyprus, I guess.

1230
01:21:57,121 --> 01:21:59,915
- It's one of the most beautiful
things I've ever seen.

1231
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,921
(chuckling)
The most beautiful thing.

1232
01:22:07,131 --> 01:22:11,009
- This kind of changes things...
doesn't it?

1233
01:22:11,135 --> 01:22:12,219
- Yeah, yeah,
it changes everything.

1234
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,555
- I think that... you know,
in terms of the brass,

1235
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:17,433
we're gonna be okay because it
happened while we were on leave,

1236
01:22:17,558 --> 01:22:21,103
but we gotta figure out
what we're... gonna do.

1237
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:24,148
- Figure out
what we're gonna do?

1238
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,445
We're gonna have a baby.

1239
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,990
- Is that what you want?

1240
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:39,705
- Yeah, of course it's what
I want, more than anything.

1241
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:42,916
(sighing)
- Okay, good, I'm glad.

1242
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,252
- You know,
you're making me crazy.

1243
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:49,047
- I know, I'm making myself crazy.
(laughter)

1244
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:52,843
- What did you think I'd think?
- I don't know, I just was...

1245
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,179
I was nervous. We didn't...

1246
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,683
...leave things very well.
(sobbing)

1247
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,977
- Come here, come here,
come here. Hey...

1248
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,980
We're gonna have a baby.

1249
01:23:07,608 --> 01:23:09,067
(both moaning)

1250
01:23:09,193 --> 01:23:11,862
Oh! Oh!
You sure it's mine?

1251
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,197
(laughter)

1252
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:32,007
(man): Niner Niner Tac on base.

1253
01:23:39,223 --> 01:23:42,309
- Cocks! Another IED hit
out on Hyena.

1254
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:46,188
One KIA. A guy out of Kabul,
father of how many, Shorty?

1255
01:23:46,313 --> 01:23:48,524
- Five, sir.
- Five. Fuck.

1256
01:23:48,649 --> 01:23:49,608
(sighing)

1257
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,444
Finding these pricks is like
nailing Jell-O to the wall.

1258
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:56,823
I cannot keep losing civilians
if we're gonna get Hyena built.

1259
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:59,743
And if we're gonna prevail
down there...

1260
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,370
Hyena's gotta go through.

1261
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:02,996
(sighing)

1262
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,790
I gotta get out there,
on the ground,

1263
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,166
gotta get
my Leopard 2s rolling,

1264
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,085
and blow them fuckers
out of their beds.

1265
01:24:08,210 --> 01:24:10,921
I gotta find
their weapons caches,

1266
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,923
I gotta fuck with
their command and control

1267
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,509
and I cannot do that bouncing
around in goddamn helicopters.

1268
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:17,636
That's a kinetic imperative,
Pete.

1269
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,222
I'm gonna need a little
help from you non-kinetic types.

1270
01:24:20,347 --> 01:24:22,975
I need you effects guys going
there and work your magic.

1271
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:25,936
- Understood, sir.
We are working on it.

1272
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,772
My Afghan guys tell me that
BDK's behind all of this shit.

1273
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,232
The more the security situation
deteriorates,

1274
01:24:30,357 --> 01:24:32,859
the more money he's making out
of all the gravel trucks,

1275
01:24:32,985 --> 01:24:34,987
all the other stuff
he's into us for.

1276
01:24:35,112 --> 01:24:37,114
- Fucking horrible little man.
- If he was out of the picture,

1277
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:40,367
getting Hyena through
would be a hell of a lot easier.

1278
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,161
- He gets knocked of his perch,
I would not weep.

1279
01:24:43,287 --> 01:24:45,372
- Understood, sir.
(sighing)

1280
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,415
- I hear the Ghost's back.

1281
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,375
- Yes, sir.
- See a threat?

1282
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,669
- Just the opposite. I think
he could be a powerful ally.

1283
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,254
- I don't care how you do it,

1284
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,423
just make sure my civilians
aren't getting hit

1285
01:24:54,548 --> 01:24:56,925
every time they drive
a fucking truck down there.

1286
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,511
- Understood, sir.
- Thanks, Pete.

1287
01:25:05,309 --> 01:25:06,935
(sighing)

1288
01:25:09,313 --> 01:25:10,981
(sighing)

1289
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,400
- Haji, what the fuck
are you doing?

1290
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,194
- What? You can't see
out of these things!

1291
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,654
- There's nothing to see.

1292
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,198
- No, not the way they are, no!

1293
01:25:20,324 --> 01:25:23,869
- Okay... Get in touch with
the Ghost, the meeting's on.

1294
01:25:23,994 --> 01:25:25,120
- You have approval?

1295
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:28,540
- It's always better to ask for
forgiveness than permission,

1296
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,833
you know that.

1297
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,170
(Cleaner chuckles)
We'll meet him at the safe house.

1298
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,514
(Ryan): This house has
a key feature.

1299
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:27,683
It's our asset, a safe house.

1300
01:26:27,808 --> 01:26:31,061
We'll set up our OP here, at the
summit of the saddle back ridge.

1301
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:34,606
That'll give us clear line of
sight to both sides of the hill:

1302
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,067
here, at the safe house,

1303
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,611
and here, where the ceremony's
gonna take place.

1304
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,154
- What's the range?
- It's comfortable,

1305
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,990
1,150, 750 metres
both sides of the hill.

1306
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:45,409
- And what about extraction?

1307
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:48,912
- We'll exfil down the back
side, through the grape fields

1308
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,956
and get picked up
en route Hyena.

1309
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:52,457
- How's this house gonna play?

1310
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:55,335
- That's unknown.

1311
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,714
There's an offer out
to the Ghost and BDK to show.

1312
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:01,091
Intel thinks they'll show up
either at the safe house

1313
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,300
or at the ceremony,

1314
01:27:02,426 --> 01:27:04,928
so we need eyes on both.

1315
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,849
This is a tricky op,
so I'll take lead.

1316
01:27:08,974 --> 01:27:11,435
Wilf, you'll stand this one
down.

1317
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:14,062
Alright, let's gear up.

1318
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,108
- I would like to thank you
for meeting with me.

1319
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,110
(Walid translates)

1320
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,487
(foreign language)

1321
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,489
- He says, "The honour is mine."

1322
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,829
(foreign language)

1323
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,670
- He says, "I'm surprised
to be here.

1324
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,922
I used to come
to this house many times."

1325
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,341
He's asking, "Do you know
who used to own this house?"

1326
01:27:43,467 --> 01:27:44,926
- Mullah Omar.

1327
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,682
(foreign language)

1328
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:55,020
- He saved his ears,
but he lost his eye.

1329
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,564
- What does that mean?
- Same same.

1330
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,025
- Same same what?
- Same same, same same.

1331
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,821
- If you ever need to use this
house for whatever reason,

1332
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,491
it's yours.
(Walid translates)

1333
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:12,287
There was an event in Panjaway
the other day,

1334
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:13,997
the village of Haji Baba.

1335
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,250
Two little girls were taking
out of the arms or their father.

1336
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,920
(Walid translates)

1337
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,843
(foreign language)
- He says, "Why have you come to me?"

1338
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:30,514
- Because the little girls were
taken by Bashir Daoud Khan.

1339
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:32,265
(Walid translates)

1340
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:39,189
My general is
a compassionate man.

1341
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,817
He's a student of Pashtunwali.

1342
01:28:41,942 --> 01:28:45,195
And he would like to help you,
to help all Afghans,

1343
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,531
to help the village
of Haji Babe.

1344
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:50,033
(Walid translates)

1345
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,160
(VelcFO)

1346
01:28:52,953 --> 01:28:54,955
(unzipping)

1347
01:28:57,123 --> 01:29:00,544
And he would be very honoured
if you would accept this gift:

1348
01:29:01,545 --> 01:29:03,421
5,000 US dollars.

1349
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:05,173
(Walid translates)

1350
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,927
He will also be honoured
if you would attend

1351
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,013
the ceremony for Hyena Road.

1352
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,182
(Walid translates)

1353
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:19,771
(foreign language)

1354
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,151
(Walid): He's saying, "Why me?
I'm a simple grape farmer."

1355
01:29:25,277 --> 01:29:27,696
- He understands this,
but your presence would do him

1356
01:29:27,821 --> 01:29:30,407
a great honour
as an elder of the region.

1357
01:29:30,532 --> 01:29:33,702
(Walid translates)

1358
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,372
(foreign language)
- "Who else will be there?"

1359
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,042
- Bashir Daoud Khan.

1360
01:29:49,009 --> 01:29:51,970
(foreign language)

1361
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,601
(Walid): "I have known this man
Bashir since he was a boy."

1362
01:29:57,726 --> 01:29:59,603
(foreign language)

1363
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,072
- "He brought great dishonour
to our cause,

1364
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,450
and he was punished
by my own hands."

1365
01:30:13,575 --> 01:30:15,702
(foreign language)

1366
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,509
- "Thank your general
for his kindness,

1367
01:30:31,635 --> 01:30:34,429
and it will be my honour
to attend."

1368
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:39,851
(chicken cackling)

1369
01:30:41,061 --> 01:30:43,438
(foreign language)

1370
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:46,232
(Walid): He says,
"The chicken hates you."

1371
01:30:51,363 --> 01:30:52,739
<i>- Yeah, Haj, 'R's me.</i>

1372
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,032
Yeah...

1373
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,076
I'm watching him walk up
the side of a mountain.

1374
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,535
Yeah, he says
he's gonna show up,

1375
01:30:57,661 --> 01:30:59,871
but I got the feeling he's got
something up his sleeve,

1376
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,707
so I'm gonna need you to get
your eyes and ears out there,

1377
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,167
see what you can learn, okay?

1378
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,461
Yeah...
(foreign language)

1379
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,883
Okay, let's get our gear,
we're going.

1380
01:31:24,688 --> 01:31:26,564
(farting)

1381
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,693
- Whoa! Local meat?

1382
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,072
- Heavenly Father...

1383
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,118
Please protect
those little girls.

1384
01:31:40,704 --> 01:31:43,123
Watch over them
and bring them home.

1385
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,344
(rattling)
(gasping, laughing)

1386
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,723
(both sighing)

1387
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,809

1388
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:05,395
- Hi, listen, I'm not sure I was
entirely clear about all this,

1389
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,355
so I want to spell it out.

1390
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,942
I'd like it very much if, um...

1391
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,529
you'd marry me, Captain Bowman.

1392
01:32:16,156 --> 01:32:20,535
- I would also like that very
much, Warrant Officer Sanders.

1393
01:32:30,170 --> 01:32:34,090
- Okay, I gotta go. We're
heading out. I gotta kit up.

1394
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,510
- Oh, why don't I...
help you with that kit.

Oh... we're crazy.

1397

1399
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,416

1400
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,799
(Jen laughing)

1401
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,011
You're driving me crazy!

Oh, fucking...

1406
01:33:53,962 --> 01:33:56,464
- Hey, hey. So how do you think
this is gonna play out?

1407
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,258
- Oh, hard to say,
a lot of variables.

1408
01:33:58,383 --> 01:34:00,468
If the plan holds,
we're golden.

1409
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,053
Anything shifts, who knows.

1410
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,847
- We got Niner Niner Tac
en route, ma'am.

1411
01:34:03,972 --> 01:34:05,932
- Okay, buddy. Here we go,
general's on his way.

1412
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,976
You were down
at the ceremony site?

1413
01:34:08,101 --> 01:34:10,311
- Yeah, on my way here.
Usual motley crew.

1414
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:12,647
Goats everywhere, shit
all over the goddamn place.

1415
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:14,691
You know what I'd like to see?

1416
01:34:14,816 --> 01:34:17,527
I'd like to see this country
host the Olympics,

1417
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,237
that would be awesome.

not one VIP's gonna be there.

1425
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:50,435
They're not gonna show.

1426
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,980

sir. It's important to them.

1427
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:57,442

You realize that, don't you?

1435
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:39,067
- I'm an optimist, sir.

1436
01:35:39,192 --> 01:35:41,236
- You're a fucking idiot,
Shorty.

1437
01:35:41,361 --> 01:35:43,154
- Roger that, sir.

1438

1439

1445
01:36:18,648 --> 01:36:20,692
- Okay, everybody, we're on.
BDK's going for it.

1446
01:36:20,817 --> 01:36:23,444
The Ghost and BDK will meet

1447
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:24,696
not at the ceremony site,

1448
01:36:24,821 --> 01:36:26,489
so this is probably gonna get
personal.

1449
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,408
You got that relay for me
at ASIC?

<i>(Pete): Alexander the Great
fought a counter-insurgency</i>

1697
01:54:22,189 --> 01:54:24,566
<i>in Afghanistan that lasted
almost three years.</i>

<i>And by the end of those years,</i>

1699
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,570

<i>One night, he got into a row</i>

<i>with a guy named Cleitus
the Black, a loyal friend.</i>

<i>Cleitus accused him
of certain things</i>

1703
01:54:35,202 --> 01:54:37,954
<i>and Alexander threw a spear
into his heart.</i>

01:54:38,080 --> 01:54:40,749
<i>As he watched his friend die,
he lost his mind.</i>

01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:43,418
<i>Five years later,
Alexander was dead.</i>

<i>you might have the clocks,</i>
