66, we're hold up inside compound at grid... Travis!

175
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,176

176
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,555
魁北克,4133-8921
Quebec, Quebec, 4133-8921.

177
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,975
我們被一群反政府武裝份子包圍了
We have a section plus of insurgents encircling compound.

178
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,563
我們4個人需要撤離地點,越快越好
We need QRF extraction for 4 PAX, ASA-fucking-P.

179
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,274
我們看見一個老人,古怪的眼睛盯著我們,他想...
We got an elder with crazy eyes, he's uh...

180
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,484
他邀請我們進屋.我們準備進去
he's asking us inside. I'm moving in.

181
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,486
我們要在這裡防守
We'll strong-point from here. Over.

182
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,323
- 他說古怪的眼睛? - 是的
- Did he say crazy eyes? - Yeah.

183
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,742
我能知道這個老人的細節嗎?
Can I get a description of the elder?

184
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,285
66號,這裡是零點
66, this is Zero.

185
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,621
描述一下對方.- 66號,你沒聽見嗎?
Describe the friendly. - 66, did you not hear me?

186
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,039
我們現在需要撤離地點!
We need QRF extraction now!

187
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,206
這很重要
It's important.

188
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,251
66號,我再說一次,描述一下對方
66, I say again, describe the friendly.Over.

189
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,671
66號,這個老人,嗯...
66, elder is about, uh...

190
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,759
我說不清,他是阿富汗人.古怪的眼睛,膚色很特殊
I don't know, he's Afghan old. Weird eyes, different colours.

191
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,260
等一下,零點,他們被圍困了
Break, break. Zero, they're jammed here,

192
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,637
我們要把他們救出來!
we gotta get them out!

193
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,639
阿爾法39.我們在努力
Three Niner Alpha, we're pushing. Will advise.

194
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,475
靠!
Fuck!

195
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,147
讓我們進去吧! 快點! 進去!
Let's move in! Come on! Let's move in!

196
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,944
- 安全! - 安全!
- Clear! - Clear!

197
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,948
每個人守住一個角落
Everybody take a quarter.

198
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,536
阿爾法39,66號在屋子裡觀察情況
Three Niner Alpha, 66 looking for status on that ride home.

199
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,581
66號,阿爾法39,接應部隊距離還有2英里
66, Three Niner Alpha, QRF is two zero Mikes out

200
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,166
你們離敵人武裝很近
and you are danger close for artillery.

201
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,961
你們必須守住.我們會盡快過去接你們
You'll have to hunker down. We'll get you out of there ASAP.

202
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,005
66號,收到.我們自力更生
66, roger, out. We're on our own.

203
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,801
- 他們暫時幫不上忙? - 很要堅持一會兒.好吧,夥計們,我們準備一下
- They can't get anything to us? - Not for a while. Okay, guys, let's arm up.

204
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,904
什麼情況?
What the fuck?

205
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,083
手雷,我需要手雷
Grenade. We need a grenade.

206
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,710
我有一個,給
I got one. Here.

207
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,768
你覺得他們在幹什麼?
What do you think they're doing?

208
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,729
和我們一樣唄,準備好
Same as us, getting ready.

209
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,075
看見什麼了嗎? 他們有82型迫擊炮
You see anything? They got an 82 recoilless!

210
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,452
哦,太好了
Oh, great.

211
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,926
- 大家沒事吧? - 沒事!
- Everybody okay? - Good!

212
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,470
- 我沒事 - 你呢?
- I'm good. - You?

213
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,264
- 他在幹什麼呢? - 我不知道
- What's he doing? - I don't know.

214
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,567
他們殺死了他!
They killed him!

215
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,947
- 夥計們,這是我們的權利 - 彼此彼此
- Gents, it's been a privilege. - Likewise.

216
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,658
幹掉所有到這裡的人!
Kill every fucker that comes through those doors!

217
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,951
收到
Roger that.

218
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,504
停止射擊!
Hold your fire!

219
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,971
塔利班? 沒有塔利班
Taliban? No Taliban.

220
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,724
我們安全了?
We're safe?

221
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,646
你相信他嗎?
You trust him?

222
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,648
準備行動!
Let's gear up!

223
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,236

Let's go!

224
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,620
謝謝
Thank you.

225
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,330
- 安全! - 安全!
- Clear! - Clear!

226
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,590
安全!安全!
Clear!

227
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,176
安全!
Clear!

228
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,347
他們都去哪了?
Where the hell'd they go?

229
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,724
阿爾法39,66號,我們在村子裡,已經安全
Three Niner Alpha, 66, we're clear in the village.

230
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,353
我們向集合撤離點進發,坐標4012-8883
Moving to rendezvous point at grid 4012-8883.

231
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,021
阿爾法39,收到
Three Niner Alpha, acknowledged.

232
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:14,986
魁北克坐標4012-8883
RV Quebec Quebec 4012-8883. Over.

233
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,996
零點,這裡是阿爾法39.66號回來了
Zero, this is Three Niner Alpha. 66 coming home. Over.

234
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,998
零點,收到
Zero, acknowledged.

235
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,168
靠!
Fuck!

236
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,157
坎大哈空軍基地
KAF.

237
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,202
在阿富汗就好像在火星上一樣
You might as well be on Mars as in Afghanistan.

238
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,079
我們在沙漠的中部
We're out in the middle of the desert,

239
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,040
被各種武裝力量包圍
surrounded by a force of razor wire.

240
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,501
這些是多達45種民族組成的武裝力量
It's a coalition force from over 45 different nations.

241
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,545
這裡三分之二的士兵
Two thirds of the soldiers deployed here

242
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,088
甚至沒有看過這個國家
never even see the country.

243
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,925
他們只是看著該死的牆壁,防禦中心,提姆 霍斯頓
They just see blast walls, DFACs, Tim Hortons.

244
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,511
沒有人真正知道基地裡到底有多少人
Nobody even knows how many people are on this base.

245
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,349
三萬五,四萬五還是六萬?
35, 45, 60,000?

246
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,725
就是這裡.在情報中心
It's here, inside the wire,

247
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,436
我們組織一切事物,傳達到外面
that we organize everything that goes on outside the wire.

248
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,563
一半的時間,我們得到的是錯誤的信息
Half the time, we got it wrong,

249
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,815
但這也意味著,我們得到了一半正確的信息
but that means half the time, we got it right.

250
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,319
這裡的消耗相當龐大
It's a vast organism that consumes

251
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,864
每天需要14噸食物,並且還要往湖裡排泄垃圾
14 metric tons of food a day and shits into a lake

252
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,700
讓人感覺空氣中有30%排泄物的氣味
that fills the air with 30% fecal matter.

253
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,081
在坎大哈空軍基地,你甚至能聞到你自己糞便的味道
In KAF, you breathe your own shit.

254
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,002
先生們,我建造了一條路
I'm building a road, gentlemen.

255
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,089
我建造的路就像匕首一樣
I'm building a big fucking road and it's going like a dagger

256
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,217
將插進敵人的心臟,把他幹掉
into the heart of the enemy and it is fucking him up.

257
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,511
每天早上他醒來,我就站在那裡
Every morning he wakes up, I'm standing there

258
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,763
打他的臉
and I'm punching him in his fucking face.

259
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,017
現在,我們距離本傑瓦爾的洪恩已經非常近了
Now, we've never been this deep into the Horn of Panjwai,

260
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,562
但是鬣狗大路就在那裡,她也在那裡等待著
but Hyena Road is in there and she's in there to stay.

261
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,439
但是他們不喜歡,因為我們限制了
And they don't like it, 'cause we're fucking

262
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,525
他們的活動自由. 所以他們干擾我們的
with their freedom of movement. So they're going after

263
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,944
運輸卡車,軍車還有工人
our dump trucks and our gravel trucks and our workers.

264
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,947
你說的是什麼?
What are you saying?

265
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,366
我是說,我們自過去四個月裡已經失去了36名平民
I'm saying I've lost 36 civilians in the last 4 months

266
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,951
這個混蛋必須停止行動
and this bullshit has got to stop.

267
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,078
我需要你的幫助
And I'm gonna need a little help from you.

268
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,832
- 將軍,我就是一個普通人 - 你是巴什 達烏德 可汗,BDK
- General, I am just one man. - You're Bashir Daoud Khan, BDK.

269
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,667
你有民兵組織
You're one man with a militia.

270
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,255
我是你們的夥伴
And I am your partner in peace.

271
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,302
所以我需要你的耳目,需要你還有你的兒子
So I need your eyes and ears and I need you and your son

272
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,053
能參加我們的慶典
to be at our little dedication ceremony,

273
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,430
那裡有多少輛車,肖迪?
how many clicks, there, Shorty?

274
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,057
- 15輛,長官 - 15輛車
- 15, sir. - 15 clicks of hardtop

275
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,475
準備去洪恩
into the Horn.

276
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,854
你的出席將...意義重大
Your presence there would be... very meaningful.

277
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,325
鬣狗大路是給阿富汗的禮物
Hyena Road is a gift to all Afghans.

278
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,494
能參加慶典是我父親和我
It would be an honour for my father and I

279
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,912
最大的榮幸
to attend your ceremony.

280
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,333
太好了
Out-fucking-standing.

281
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,171
- 謝謝,將軍 - 謝謝你,長官
- Thank you, general. - Thank you, sir.

282
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,937
瞧那個小傻瓜,他很像是卡利古拉
Look at the little prick. He's like Caligula.

283
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,982
建造鬣狗大路會容易很多的
It'd be a fuck of a lot easier to get Hyena built

284
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,650
如果那個小傻瓜不在竊竊私語的話
if that prick would stop breathing.

285
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,278
正確,你是對的.我要坐飛機
Right there, you're right. I'm gonna hop a flight.

286
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,822
我要去斯波,去見一位長者
I wanna get to Sper, run down a lead on an elder.

287
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,449
告訴阿姆斯特朗,準備飛機
Tell Armstrong I'll call in from the FOB.

288
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,618
你不想和我在一起了?
You don't want to hang out with me?

289
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,037
哦,你知道的,我很想的
Oh, you know there is nothing I'd rather do

290
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,663
但是西部文明的未來
but the future of Western civilization

291
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,957
還要取決於我去斯波打拼
depends on my ass getting out to Sper.

292
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,768
亞歷山大在2500年前
Alexander the Great marched into this graveyard

293
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,395
攻入了這片土地
about 2,500 years ago.

294
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:04,024
他說,進攻容易,防守難
Easy to march in, hard to march out. His words.

295
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,277
他總和他的母親相互寫信
He and his mother wrote to each other all the time.

296
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,529
一天,他收到了一封來自他母親的信
One day, he got a letter from her saying,

297
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,699
"這到底怎麼回事? 你能用一天半的時間征服世界上很多著名的地方
"What the hell? You conquered most of the known world in a day and a half,

298
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,326
怎麼卻在阿富汗停滯不前?"
what are you doing bogged down in Afghanistan?"

299
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,454
她抓起個袋子,往裡面裝滿了泥土
He grabbed a bag and shoveled it full of dirt

300
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,248
他把這袋泥土和一條消息一起送回了希臘他母親那裡
and had it sent back to Greece with a message to his mother,

301
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,834
"拿這些泥土倒在皇宮周圍
"Take this dirt and dump it around the palace,

302
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,127
看看會發生什麼"
see what happens."

303
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,754
6-1,遭受攻擊,左側,10點鐘方向
6-1, taking fire, left, 10 o'clock.

304
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,214
300米,右路受阻
300 metres, breaking right.

305
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,726
消滅敵人
Clear to engage.

306
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:51,280
目標被摧毀,收到
Target is neutralized. Roger.

307
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,823
後來亞歷山大的母親
So Alexander's mother

308
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,617
把泥土倒在了皇宮的周圍
spread the dirt all around the palace.

309
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,619
夜裡,一些隨從出來了
Later that night, a couple of attendants showed up

310
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,037
來確認她沒事
to make sure she was alright.

311
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,372
一個說,"你走前面,我跟著你"
One says, "Go ahead, after you."

312
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,124
另一個說,"不,我跟著你"
And the other says, "No, after you."

313
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,460
然後第一個人又說,"不,我堅持"
And the first one says, "No, I insist."

314
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,213
第二個人又說,"別告訴我該怎麼做"
And the second one says, "Don't you tell me what to do."

315
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,881
他們拿著劍互相攻擊
They pull their swords and go at it

316
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,841
直到他們互相殺死對方
till they kill each other.

317
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,426
亞歷山大的母親看到了這一切
Alexander's mother watched all this

318
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:16,764
給他回了一封信說,"好的,現在我明白了'"
and wrote a note to him saying, "Okay, okay, now I get it."

319
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,768
他回信說:"就連泥土都可能是敵人"
And he wrote back saying, "Even the dirt is hostile."

320
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,396
在阿富汗,狗咬狗
In Afghanistan, dogs fight dogs,

321
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,067
鳥吃鳥,人殺人
birds fight birds, men kill men.

322
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,527
開火!
Fire!

323
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,661
哦,夥計,快點,給我看看照片
Oh, man, come on, show me their picture.

324
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,878
- 介意我坐這裡嗎? - 不介意,批准了,請吧
- Mind if I join you? - Not at all, Warrant. Please.

325
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,849
嘿,我剛剛從工程師那裡得到了新的消息
Hey, I got an update from the engineer

326
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,434
昨天在鬣狗大路上
on that stretch of Hyena from yesterday.

327
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,770
他們清理了8顆地雷
They cleared 8 IEDs in all.

328
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,522
最後一次出錯了
Something went wrong with the last one.

329
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,317
一個傢伙失去了半條腿.他們把他送回國了
The guy lost his leg above the knee. They airlifted him to Landstuhl.

330
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,822
我覺得我們需要談談,嘿,嗯...
I think we need to talk. Hey, uh...

331
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,199
嘿,簡.抱歉打擾你們
Hi, Jen. Sorry to interrupt here.

332
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,659
瑞恩,我是皮特 米歇爾
Ryan, I'm Pete Mitchell,

333
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,202
旅裡的執行長官
one of the effects guys with Brigade.

334
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,122
我不想打攪你吃飯,但是你介意
I don't mean to wreck your meal, but you mind

335
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,165
我有些話要和你說嗎? - 好的
if I have a word with you? - Sure.

336
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,585
一會兒見
Catch up to you later.

337
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,886
當你和你的夥計們在哈吉 巴巴作戰時
I was in the TOC where you guys

338
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,597
我正在指揮中心
had that engagement in Haji Baba.

339
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,224
你們很幸運
You were fucking lucky.

340
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,895
你到這裡來就是和我講這些?
You come all the way out here to tell me that?

341
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,314
不是的
Nope.

342
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,026
不,我來這裡是因為
No, I came out here because.and I could be

343
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,194
有些事不合適...- 你知道的,坦白講
way out of line here but... - you know, manifestly,

344
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,238
你和 簡 有點什麼事
you and Jen got a little something going.

345
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,199
作為一個戰鬥團隊
On behalf of the entire battle group,

346
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,493
我要表達我們大家的妒忌之心!
I'd just like to express our collective fucking jealousy!

347
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,748
你有女人嗎?
You got a girl?

348
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,834
是的,女人是我回家的夢想
Yeah. Woman of my dreams, back home.

349
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,047
- 她知道你做什麼嗎? - 我妻子? 不
- Does she know what you do? - My wife? No

350
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,424
她以為我在情報中心
She thinks I work inside the wire

351
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,469
我只能這樣,讓她能睡個安穩覺
and I'm gonna leave it that way. Let her sleep easy at night.

352
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,932
告訴我
Tell me something.

353
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,644
你對普什圖法典知道多少?
How much you do you know about Pashtunwali?

354
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,272
不管手冊裡怎麼講,你知道
Whatever's in the handbook, you know

355
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,734
它是一種部族編碼,很古老,哦,是的
It's a tribal code. It's old. Oh yeah.

356
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,655
它太古老了,看起來像是伊斯蘭教的某種附加語
It's so old they look upon Islam as a kind of recent add-on.

357
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,159
- 這是什麼? - 是海棗
- What are those? - They're dates.

358
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,536
當地的. 通便的
They're local. They help you shit.

359
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,710
這些代碼由一些,嗯...
The code has got a bunch of, uh...

360
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,671
他們稱之為核心
Well, they call them pillars.

361
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,923
其中一種是潘納
And one of them is Panah,

362
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,592
意思就是...保護,所以當那位長者
which means... protection, more or less. So when that elder

363
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,053
邀請你進屋時,等於給了你一個潘納
invited you into his home, he gave you Panah:

364
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,097
對你沒有惡意
no harm could come to you.

365
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,309
嗯...你的意思是那麼我欠他一個人情?
Uh... so I owe him, you mean?

366
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,770
他是為真主而做的,不是為了你
Well, he did it for Allah, didn't do it for you.

367
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,855
但是你還活著,這很重要
But you're still breathing, so that'd be your call.

368
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,111
那位長者...
This elder...

369
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,697
他會講英語嗎?
He speak any English?

370
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,492
不會,只是簡單幾個詞語而已
No. Just a couple words.

371
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,537
他有什麼特點嗎,傷疤?
Any marks about him, any scars?

372
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,915
- 沒有,但是他的眼睛很古怪. - 怎麼古怪了?
- No, but he had weird eyes. - Weird how?

373
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,626
他的左眼是棕色的,右眼卻是深藍色的
His left eye was brown and his right eye was deep blue.

374
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,920
嗯
Hmm.

375
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,258
那麼這傢伙是誰? 你為什麼...
So who is this guy? Why do you...

376
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,802
為什麼給我這個潘納
Why did he give me this Panah?

377
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,721
這也是我想知道的
That's what I wanna know.

378
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,182
明天早上我帶一個巡邏隊回到村子裡去
I got a patrol going back into the village in the morning.

379
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,017
我希望你也能來
I'd really like if you'd come along with me,

380
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,019
見識一下那個傢伙
help me ID the guy.

381
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:55,023
- 好的,沒問題,我會來的 - 0900
- Yeah, sure, I'll be there. - 0900.

382
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,817
- 好的 - 好的
- Alright. - Alright.

383
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,736
- 明早見 - 好的
- I'll see you in the morning. - Yeah.

384
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,573
- 你怎麼想? - 嗯...
- What are you thinking? - Hmm...

385
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,202
我在想我們在塞浦路斯的酒店房間
I'm thinking about our hotel room in Cyprus.

386
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,795
嗯...
Um...

387
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,382
好吧,我想說點事情
Okay, I'm gonna say something,

388
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,636
我要對我們兩個說,很糟糕
and I say it for both of us and it's going to be shitty.

389
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,639
必須要說
It's gotta be said.

390
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,477
- 靠 - 你知道我是
- Fuck me. - You know that I am

391
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,438
很喜歡你的,還有塞浦路斯...
completely crazy about you, and Cyprus was...

392
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,821
塞浦路斯非常不錯
Cyprus was perfect.

393
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,491
我們也是完美的一對兒
We're perfect.

394
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,618
但是,我們不能再這樣繼續下去了,我們都知道的
But we can't keep doing this, we both know that.

395
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,622
如果我們繼續的話,我們都會被開除的
If we get caught, I'm gonna get cashiered.

396
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,958
這是我的事業.也是我的事業
This is my career. It's mine too.

397
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,127
我知道,這就是我要說的
I know, this is what I'm saying.

398
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,129
當我們...還要輪流回家,我們就會明白了
When we... rotate home, we'll see.

399
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,215
但是現在,我們在這裡,必須停下來
But right now, while we're here, it's got to stop.

400
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,179
那麼這就是分手了?
So this is it?

401
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,850
就算是吧
I think it has to be.

402
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,527
這簡直是世界末日啊
This is like fucking Armageddon.

403
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,070
我知道
I know.

404
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,368
你知道,這裡沒有什麼
You know there's nothing that I would rather do right now

405
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,371
比我認識你做的更正確的事情了
than climb over there and fraternize the shit out of you.

406
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,875
嗯...
Hmm...

407
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,253
你不能憑一句話就結束了
You can't dump me in one sentence

408
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,338
然後說些亂七八糟的
then say something like that in the next.

409
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,723
啊...!
Ah...!

410
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,890
現在,我們要進入葡萄地,如果你看見電線
Now, when we get to the grape fields, if you see wire,

411
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,017
金屬或是塑料之類的
you see metal, you see plastic,

412
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,561
趕快轉身,別踩上去
newly turned dirt, don't step on 'em.

413
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,813
你不小心踩上了.別亂動
You didn't drop it, don't pick it up.

414
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,941
請和巡邏隊的士兵保持
Try to stay at least five body lengths

415
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,901
至少五個身體的距離
between the next man in the patrol.

416
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,527
當我們進入村子的時候
When we get in the village,

417
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,488
你如果看見包裹著衣服的女人
you're gonna see women dressed in bags.

418
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,864
請不要盯著她們看
Please don't stare at them.

419
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,617
我知道也許你在多倫多活著巴黎也見過類似的人群
I know you've probably seen that in Toronto or Paris,

420
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,869
但是你沒有在這裡見過
but you haven't seen it here.

421
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,829
這裡的女人對你可能很有吸引力
Here, those bags are like magnets for your eyes.

422
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,958
如果你總盯著她們看,她們會對我們不利的
If you get caught staring at them, it'll fuck shit up for us.

423
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,381
快速止血器,止血帶,繃帶
Quick clot, tourniquet, bandage.

424
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,257
我都不知道怎麼使用啊
I don't know how to use any of that.

425
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,345
夫人,如果是你需要使用的話,也不需要你親自來用
Ma'am, if it has to be used, it won't be you using it.

426
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,982
嘿!眼神!
Hey! Eyes!

427
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,286
在戰爭中,能見到
In my job, it is a great honour

428
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,704
像您這樣一位長者是我的榮幸
to meet elders such as yourself.

429
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,831
今天,我見到了您.所以今天是個好日子
Today, I meet you, so it's a good day.

430
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,667
但是,我希望能見到村裡的另一位長者
But I was hoping to meet another elder in this village.

431
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,559
她說,"我是這裡唯一的長者,沒有其他人了"
He says that, "I'm the only elder, and there is no other."

432
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,604
奇怪了.有人告訴我,這裡還有一位很重要的人物
Strange. Someone told me there was another important man

433
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,773
他就住在村子裡,但是不管他叫什麼
that lived in this village, but I forget his name.

434
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,941
這個人令人難以忘懷
But this person said you couldn't forget him

435
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,902
因為他的兩隻眼睛顏色不一樣
because he had two different coloured eyes.

436
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,337
嘿,嘿,嘿!你怎麼回事?
Hey, hey, hey! What's in your head?

437
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,630
你站太高了
You're too high.

438
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,465
你都能看見沒穿衣服的女人了
You can see the women without their bags.

439
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,259
下來!下來! 抱歉,長官
Get down! Get down! Sorry, sir.

440
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,969
我認為你知道我的意思
I think you know who I mean.

441
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,056
他說他是個幽靈
He says he's a ghost.

442
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,808
即使是幽靈也需要住在什麼地方啊
Even ghosts have to live somewhere.

443
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,529
他說,他們大多住在坎大哈
He says most of them live in Kandahar City.

444
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,464
哈吉,你在幹什麼?
Haji, what the fuck are you doing?

445
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,050
地毯髒了!
The carpets, they are dusty!

446
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,846
整個國家都髒了
The entire country is dusty.

447
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,849
快點,喝茶去,到我辦公室來
Come on, let's have some tea. Step into my office.

448
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,852
你好嗎,皮特? 你的家人好嗎?
How are you doing, Pete? How's your family?

449
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,688
過得如何? 不錯
How's your time? It's good.

450
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,772
你怎樣?
And how's yours?

451
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,608
我從喀布爾聽說? 你什麼時候能見到他們?
You heard from Kabul? When will you see 'em?

452
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,443
很快
Soon.

453
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,947
你皺眉頭
You're frowning.

454
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,741
我覺得你太瘋狂了
I thought you were crazy,

455
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,411
但是我錯了.我並不想出錯
but I was wrong, and I don't like to be wrong.

456
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,288
我外甥說也許他在這裡
My cousin says maybe he is here.

457
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,331
- 在坎大哈?  - 他認為是的
- In K-City? - He thinks so.

458
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,958
他為什麼回來了?
Why is he back?

459
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,004
- 如果是他 - 但是眼睛不對!
- If it's even him. - But the eyes!

460
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,134
如果是他,你覺得你能帶我去見他嗎?
If it is him, do you think you can get me to see him?

461
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,636
我舅舅明天會安排的
My uncle has arranged it for tomorrow.

462
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,598
告訴他,我準備帶一個人單獨去
Tell them I'm gonna bring along another guy,

463
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,516
狙擊手在戰鬥群裡
the master sniper with the battle group.

464
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,226
還有一件事.不大相關的
One other thing. It's not relational.

465
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,687
- 有關的 - 有關的,是的
- Related. - Related, yes.

466
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,148
我聽到一些關於襲擊的事情
I'm hearing something about an attack.

467
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,357
- 在坎大哈? - 很快
- In K-City? - Soon.

468
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,109
我就知道這麼多.我發現更多信息
That's all I know. As soon as I

469
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,736
我會告訴你的
find out more, I will tell you.

470
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,196
好的
Okay.

471
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,741
你怎麼樣? 有什麼需要的嗎?
How are you? Do you need anything?

472
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,159
不,我很好
No, I'm good.

473
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,827
你總是說你很好
You always say you're good.

474
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,871
我是阿富汗人!
I'm Afghan!

475
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,958
哦.聽著,我給你帶來了...
Oh, listen, I got you...

476
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,795
一些洗髮水
I got you some of that shampoo,

477
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,799
護手霜,你們很喜歡的東西
some of that... hand cream you guys are so crazy about.

478
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,014
- 謝謝.太好了 - 別客氣,朋友
- Thank you. This is great. - You're welcome, my friend.

479
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,516
這是我的最愛
It's my favourite.

480
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,896
夥計們!聽著,這次是直接行動
Guys, listen up, this is straight from the brass.

481
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,439
夥計們!聽著!好的
Guys! Listen! Alright.

482
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,027
別搞砸了.你們這幫笨蛋!
No more fraternizing with goats, you bunch of goat fuckers!

483
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,403
好的,聽好
Okay, listen up.

484
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,780
今晚4名隊員出發
All four DETs are out tonight,

485
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,115
所有隊員要注意觀察和匯報,除了你,特拉維斯
all ops are observe and report, except for you, Travis.

486
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,909
你的人在鬣狗大路上
You guys are on that bend in Hyena

487
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,203
樹傍邊,所以注意警惕
where that fucking tree is, so keep your eyes peeled.

488
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,539
我要臨時退居二線一天
I've been seconded to intel for the day,

489
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,458
我去坎大哈
so I'm heading into K-City.

490
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,752
沃爾夫這裡你負責
Wilf here is going to step up.

491
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,050
好的,我得到了一些壞消息
Alright. I got some bad news.

492
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,052
他們抓走了
They grabbed a couple of guys

493
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,804
第10山地連的幾個兄弟
from 10th Mountain Dog Company.

494
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,138
- 什麼? - 是的
- What? - Yeah.

495
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,642
我也不知道詳情,但是他們可能是排雷小隊的
I don't know the details, but there was an IED of some sort

496
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,644
還有兩個在特立斯被抓走的
and the Talis grabbed two of them.

497
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,647
他們還活著嗎?
Are they alive?

498
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,274
是的
Yeah.

499
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,280
靠!
Fuck!

500
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,410
你可以用炸彈轟了我
You can blow me up with an IED...

501
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,123
用AK機槍向我掃射,用裝甲車幹掉我!
shoot me with an AK, fucking run me over with a LAV!

502
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,794
我...我沒事
I'm... I'm fucking fine with that.

503
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,588
但是,別讓我在中東
But do not let me get taken alive by these...

504
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,966
這些傢伙面前苟且偷生
fucking medievalists.

505
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,386
你沒事吧?
You good?

506
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,807
他們到底和你說了什麼?
What exactly do they do to you?

507
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,184
- 機密 - 新的命令!
- It's unspeakable. - New comm logs!

508
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,478
填表格. 他們是什麼意思?
Fill them out. What do you mean?

509
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,523
嘿...機密的意思就是不能說
Hey... Unspeakable means we don't fucking speak about it.

510
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:04,591
目標倒下,撤退
Targets down. Let's back up.

511
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,438
第一次啊,感覺如何?
First time, well... how do you feel?

512
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,731
很好
Good.

513
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,734
- 準備好了嗎? - 不,還沒
- Ready to go? - No, not quite.

514
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,486
我要拉臭.什麼?! 為什麼?
I gotta take a shit. What?! Why?

515
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,237
為什麼? 我不知道.也許因為...
Why? I don't know. Maybe because my...

516
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,573
腸子裡都是屎? 給我個袋子
long intestine's full of shit? Give me the bag.

517
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,534
謝謝
Thanks.

518
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,209
多美好的夜晚啊
What a beautiful night.

519
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:44,172
你知道,如果他們能把這個地方拿下的話,我就回去
You know, if they get this place together, I'd come back.

520
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,716
帶喬伊去野營. 野營?
Bring Joey camping. Camping?

521
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,760
- 是的 - 在坎大哈?
- Yeah. - In Kandahar?

522
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,471
為什麼不行?
Why the fuck not?

523
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:57,394
2號目標解決了.準備回家
Number 2's fully offloaded. Good to go.

524
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,815
阿爾法39
Three Niner Alpha.

525
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,610
這裡是66號,準備去撤離點
This is 66 Bravo ready for extraction. Over.

526
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,405
走吧,沃爾夫
Let's go, Wilf.

527
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,135
- 多美麗的早晨啊 - 是啊,只有兩個小時
- It's a beautiful morning. - Yeah, it's been for two hours.

528
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,845
護衛隊什麼時候來?
How long until the convoy?

529
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,389
應該在路上了,也許還有5到10英里
Should be on the move, five to ten Mikes maybe.

530
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,601
他們是阿富汗人,你相信他們嗎?
These A&A dudes, you trust these guys?

531
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,521
用我生命保證
With my life.

532
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,731
這是他們的戰爭,我們只是路過
It's their war. We're just along for the ride.

533
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,817
嘿,沃爾德
Hey, Walid.

534
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,694
嗯?
Huh?

535
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,113
收音機裡是什麼?
What's he got going on the tunes?

536
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,284
利夫 加勒特
Leif Garrett.

537
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,326
- 開玩笑吧 - 是他
- You're shitting me. - Yeah.

538
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,162
放大點聲音,大家都聽聽!
Come on, put it out, for all to hear!

539
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,344
好的,護衛隊來了,安靜!
Okay, convoy's on the move. Mount up!

540
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,534
威士忌高爾夫9號,我們進來了
Golf Niner Whisky, we're pulling in. Over.

541
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,370
收到.威士忌高爾夫9號.進來吧
Roger that, Golf Niner Whisky. Join in.

542
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,381
右轉
Take this right.

543
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,095
這裡是威士忌高爾夫9號,我們分開走
This is Golf Niner Whisky. We're breaking off.

544
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,430
感謝你帶路
Thanks for the tow.

545
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,015
皮特,這裡的某個地方
Pete, anywhere here.

546
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,236
- 這傢伙是誰? - 他被稱為清潔工
- Who is that guy? - He's called the Cleaner.

547
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,323
他是我見過的很勇敢的傢伙,最好的盟友
He's the bravest man I've ever known and my greatest ally.

548
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,617
他為我們工作,但是不能暴露身份
He works for us but can't be seen with us,

549
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,202
你是否知道我的意思.他的家在喀布爾
if you know what I mean. His family's up in Kabul

550
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,705
他在過去三年裡他都沒怎麼見過他的家人
and he hasn't seen them or slept in the same bed

551
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,291
和家人一起睡覺不超過3個晚上
for more than three nights running in the last two years.

552
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,376
他為什麼做這些?
Why's he doing it?

553
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,255
愛國? 我也不知道
Love of country? I honestly don't know.

554
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,592
不僅僅是為了我們付給他的錢
Can't just be for the money we pay him.

555
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,180
他說他叫穆罕默德
He says his name is Mohammed.

556
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,393
是啊,當然是的.麵包看起來不錯啊
Yeah, of course it is. This bread looks very good.

557
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,109
這是瑞恩,我們是朋友
My friend Ryan, we've been friends,

558
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,820
我們認識,並且相互友愛
we've known each other and loved each other

559
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,321
很多很多年
for many, many years.

560
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,824
你在哈吉 巴巴幫助了我的朋友
And you helped my friend in the village of Haji Baba.

561
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,792
我要為此報答你
And I would like to repay you for that kindness.

562
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,544
你一定需要些什麼
You must need something,

563
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,630
也許是清真寺裡的祈禱用的地毯
perhaps new prayer rugs for your mosque.

564
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,675
我要幫助你
I would like to help with that.

565
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,266
- 這是多少錢啊? - 我也不知道
- How much is that? - I have no idea.

566
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,644
給你的村子
This is for your village.

567
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,536
他說,"不知道原因就接受禮物
He says, "Only a fool accepts a gift

568
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,413
是很愚昧的"
without knowing what it's for."

569
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,503
有一個傳說中的戰士
There is a legendary warrior,

570
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,546
一個穆斯林人在吉哈德和蘇聯人作戰
a mujahideen in the Jihad against the Soviets.

571
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,715
他被稱為沙漠之獅
He was called the Lion of the Desert.

572
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,022
他說,"他聽說過這個人"
He says, "he's heard of this man."

573
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,360
我的意思是他回來了,再次參加聖戰
The word is that he's back. He's once again mujahid.

574
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,904
你聽說過這個傳言嗎?
Have you heard anything about these rumours?

575
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,085
我可以問問你們從哪裡來嗎?
May I ask where you're from?

576
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,553
他說."他的村子是阿布杜拉 喬"
He says his village is called Abdullah Jan.

577
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,346
啊,所以你是巴基斯坦人
Ah. So you're Pakistani.

578
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,571
我在巴基斯坦待了很多年
I have been Pakistani for many years,

579
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,407
穆斯林1400人,普什圖族5000人
a Muslim for 1,400 and a Pashtun for 5,000.

580
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,327
我明白了
I understand.

581
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,082
如果你聽到任何關於沙漠之獅的消息...
If you hear anything about the Lion...

582
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,126
我會很感激的
I would greatly appreciate it.

583
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,604
那麼他是巴基斯坦人?
So he's Pakistani?

584
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,772
不
No.

585
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,650
不,那只是個測試
No, that was just a kind of test.

586
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,778
阿布杜拉 喬只是個被毀了的村子
Abdullah Jan is just the ruins of some village

587
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,906
橫穿斯濱 波大格的邊界
across the border from Spin Boldak.

588
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,324
那裡已經有上百年
Nobody's really lived there

589
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,619
沒有人居住了.尤其是他們
for a couple hundred years, least of all him.

590
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,121
那麼他不是從村子裡來的人
So he's not just some guy from a village.

591
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,873
不,他不是
No, he's not.

592
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,044
他是沙漠之獅.人們就是這樣稱呼他的
He's the Lion of the Desert. That's what his people call him.

593
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,927
但是俄羅斯人稱他為幽靈
But the Russians, they called him the Ghost

594
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,845
因為他們無法殺死他
'cause they couldn't kill him.

595
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,432
他們射殺了他4次,炸了他2次
They shot him four times, they blew him up twice.

596
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,853
每次,他都能逃到山那邊的
And each time, his guys would get him up over the mountains

597
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,272
巴基斯坦的紅十字會裡去
and into the Red Cross tents in Pakistan.

598
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,566
他們想讓他妥協
And they'd get him stitched up

599
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,778
他卻每次都把俄羅斯人炸飛
and he'd be back out there blowing Russians out of the sky.

600
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,284
我們剛才會見了一個大人物
We just met a very big gun,

601
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,620
就像隆美爾或者是帕頓
like a Rommel or a Patton.

602
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,248
這傢伙還是個孩子的時候就和蘇聯紅軍打過仗
This guy beat the Red Army and he was a kid when he did it.

603
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,837
當蘇聯撤出後,他和塔利班達成了協議
When the Russians pulled out, he cut a deal with the Talibans,

604
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,007
"我要回到我的葡萄地去,我不希望
"I'm going back to my grape fields, I don't want any part

605
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,760
這裡再發生任何內戰.別來打攪我"
of your stupid civil war. Just leave me alone."

606
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,097
他所做的,有些不可思議
Which they did, which was kind of weird,

607
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,473
因為一般說來
'cause generally speaking,

608
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,850
塔利班不會放過反對他們的人
the Talis went after anybody who stood against them.

609
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,603
但是對於他,由於某些原因,他們卻很牽就他
But him, for some reason, they just left him alone.

610
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,483
- 但是他回來了 - 他回來了
- But now he's back. - He's back,

611
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,527
我在想是什麼原因.像他這樣一個人
and I gotta figure out why. A guy like him,

612
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,861
以他的勢力,沒可能啊
with his influence, he could prob

613
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,632
我們遭到炸彈襲擊,汽車炸彈還有其他的
We got multiple bombers, vehicle-borne and coordinated.

614
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,758
報告平民傷亡情況
Reporting civilian casualties,

615
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,719
有幾個平民陣亡,在城市中心地帶...

616
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,804
派無人機去坎大哈
Got a VBIED southwest Kandahar City.

617
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,389
有幾個平民受傷
Multiple casualties.

618
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,767

A&A reports taking fire, I-route 1 and Alpha 7-5.

619
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,895
一定炸到發動機了
Must have hit the engine block.

620
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,315
- 見鬼 - 皮特,護衛隊呢?
- Goddamnit. - Peter, where's the convoy?

621
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,860
- 我們和護衛隊失去了聯絡 - 好吧...
- We lost the convoy. - Alright...

622
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,739
零點,威士忌高爾夫9號,嗯...

Yeah, Golf Niner Whisky, we have contact

at grid Quebec Romeo 232-129. We have no mil casualties.

626
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,749

00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,129
恐怖份子. 更多信息一會兒跟進

630
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,797
- 威士忌高爾夫9號,收到 - 是的,很像是
- Golf Niner Whisky, send. - Yeah, it looks like

631
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,383
是塔利班干的. 趕快撤離那裡
the Talis are at it again. It's a shit storm out there.

632
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,010
我建議你迅速撤出城市
I advise you try and exit city,

633
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,137
去納森 史密斯營地,就是這個

還會有爆炸的! 快走!

636
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,517
我們必須離開這裡,往北走
We're gonna have to move. Heading north.

637
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,395
見鬼,不能帶著無線電嗎
Goddamnit, can't get the radio.

638
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,064
別弄無線電了,用我的無線電
Forget the radio, we'll use my MBITR.

639
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,900
我們走吧! 快走!
Let's go! We gotta move!

640
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,285
- 我要把它炸掉. - 沃爾德?

安全,走著

650
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,336
RPG火箭!

00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,007
你沒事吧?
You good?

652

是的,還好
Yeah, good.

653

- 你能開槍嗎? - 我? 不行,我是頭兒

662
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,684
等一下
Hold up.

663
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,311
我需要你去左翼
I need you to punch left,

664
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,479
走那邊的小巷,我掩護你

665
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,315
你行嗎? 是的,我可以

安全
Clear.

670
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,715
太糟了
This is bad.

671
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,176
遇上勁敵了
You piss with the dick you got.

672
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,220
前進
Moving.

673
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,106
- 換子彈,掩護我 - 好的
- Changing mags, cover me. - Alright.

674
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,653
前進
Moving.

675
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,743

677
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,027
- 開槍啊 - 我不殺孩子
- Shoot him. - I don't shoot kids.

678
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,583
安全 安全
Clear. Clear.

679
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,550
炸彈! 啊!
Bomber! Ah!

680
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,385
是自己人,是清潔工!
It's my guy, it's my guy, it's the Cleaner!

681
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,637
快走!
Go, go, go, go!

682
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,945
哈吉,你哪兒弄來的卡車?
Haji, where did you get this truck?

683
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,488
我舅舅的!
My uncle!

684
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,115
當然!
Of course!

685
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,200
我在閒逛,你不一直瞭解這個城市!
I hung around, you never know in this city!

686
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,787
我聽到了槍聲,就過來照看一下你們! 我們太幸運了!
I heard the gunfire, came looking for you! We got lucky!

687
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,039
靠,是的!
Fuck, yeah!

688
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,666
零點,這裡是威士忌高爾夫9號,我們撤離了
Zero, this is Golf Niner Whisky, we're heading out.

689
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,835
零點,收到
Zero, acknowledged.

690
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,670
見鬼!
Goddamn!

691
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,685
太痛快了,橫衝直撞,太瘋狂了!
That was balls out, flat out, fucking insanity!

692
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,980
5枚自殺式炸彈,一大箱RPG火箭
Five suicide bombers, a rack of RPGs,

693
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,984
死17人,傷37人.我要喝杯咖啡
17 dead and 37 wounded. I gotta get a coffee.

694
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,944
我們知道他們之後要幹什麼嗎?
Do we know what they were after?

695
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,739
是的,警察總署.我們差點陷進去
Yeah. Police headquarters. We just got caught up in it.

696
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,367
那是坎大哈 卡瑪.夥計,就是那裡
That is Kandahar karma, baby, that's what that is.

697
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,452
但是我不得不說,你使用槍械
But I gotta say, you handle your rifle

698
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,371
動作很僵硬啊
like you got ice in your veins.

699
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,872
那些塔利班人使用AK步槍
Well, those Talis were using AKs,

700
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,375
很不錯的武器,如果你在電話亭裡
which is great weapons if you're in a phone booth.

701
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,254
你在這個城市干很久了? 是的
You work the city a lot? A fair bit, yeah.

702
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,424
- 不可思議的工作 - 哦,是的...
- You got a weird job. - Oh, yeah...

703
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,176
那你呢...你不是嗎?
And you... and you don't?

704
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,637
我? 不!
Me? No!

705
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:35,099
不,所有人都知道規矩.你拿起一把AK步槍,一個PRG火箭筒
No, everybody knows the rules. You pick up an AK, an RPG,

706
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,810
你應該聽說過.這裡沒有灰色地帶
you're gonna hear about it. There's no gray area.

707
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,979
那麼,除非回家,他們會認為你做的事情
Well, except back home, where they think what you do

708
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,607
有一點...我不知道...事先計劃好的
is a little too... I don't know... premeditated.

709
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,485
但是我的話? 內心和想法? 他們會欣然接受
But my shit? Hearts and Minds? They lap that stuff up

710
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,278
因為這是道德上的問題
'cause it's got a moral ring to it,

711
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,780
儘管他們多半只是PR
even if it's mostly just PR.

712
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,740
你相信這些?
You believe that?

713
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,035
這裡的人...
These people here...

714
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,247
他們對不起我給他們提供的幫助
they got no use for what we have on offer.

715
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,208
他們不需要賈斯丁?比伯和托馬斯·傑斐遜
They don't want Justin Bieber and Tom Jefferson

716
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,626
或者是什麼破色情雜誌
and our fucking pornography.

717
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,713
他們只需要錢和安逸的環境
They just want our money and a little bit of stability.

718
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,925
- 那我們如何能贏? - 這裡沒有輸贏
- So how do we win? - There is no winning

719
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,553
這裡只會有停戰協定和
There's just an end state and that's gonna get laid down

720
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,138
外交政策,不取決於我們
by foreign policy, not by us.

721
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,181
你是個玩世不恭的人
You're a cynical man.

722
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,184
不是關於這個國家,我不是的
Not about this country, I'm not.

723
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,061
不是關於這裡的人
Not about these people.

724
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,897
我也是.我只相信
Me neither. And I gotta believe

725
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,483
6美元一個彈夾的子彈
that if I put a $6 round,

726
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,153
打到了正確的地方
just one bullet in the right place,

727
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,988
我能改變一切
I could change everything.

728
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,158
你也許是對的
You may be right.

729
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,996
- 你要去斯波? - 不
- You gonna stick around Sper? - No.

730
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,748
我要搭飛機.我該出發了
I'm gonna hop a flight. Should grab my gear.

731
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,085
我會聯繫你.我就在附近
I'll be in touch. I'll be around.

732
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,522
別說話,聽著
Don't say anything, just listen.

733
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,733
我知道這裡的形勢,我知道這不可能
I know our situation, I know it doesn't make sense,

734
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,610
但是你需要聽好
but you need to hear this from me.

735
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,069
我愛你
I love you.

736
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,822
從現在直到死
Right down to the bone, right down to the goddamned

737
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,365
你需要知道這些
fucking marrow. You need to know that.

738
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,493
好的.知道了
Ditto. All of it.

739
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,130
- 哈吉,你在幹什麼? - 洗洗椅子
- Haji, what are you doing? - Cleaning the chairs.

740
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,257
- 那不是你的工作 - 那是誰的工作呢?
- It's not your job. - Whose job is it?

741
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,383
管他呢
Well, it's nobody's.

742
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,053
這就是為什麼你的椅子總是很髒
This is why you have dirty chairs!

743
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,014
我要喝點茶,快點
I need some tea. Come on.

744
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,642
他都沒什麼可說的
Why would he even agree to a meeting

745
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,185
為什麼還要開會?
if he has absolutely nothing to say?

746
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,521
他也許想讓大家知道他回來了
Maybe he just wants the Coalition to know he's back.

747
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,607
也許吧,但是為什麼呢?
Maybe, but for what?

748
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,069
我們需要知道誰在村子裡
We need to know who's in that village.

749
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,695
你能去塔吉克地區
Can you get into the Tazkera Registry,

750
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,030
看看誰住在那裡?
find out who lives there?

751
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,617
我有個舅舅,他在政府工作
I have an uncle, he works in the Governor's palace.

752
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,869
天那,你到底有多少個舅舅?
God, how many uncles do you have?

753
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,247
很多
Pff. Many.

754
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,498
告訴我...
Tell me...

755
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,170
你覺得我的頭髮如何? 我用了洗髮水
What do you think of my hair? I've been using the shampoo.

756
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,507
看起來很順滑很有型
It looks silky smooth and very manageable.

757
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,884
- 啊! 我的手呢? - 嗯...
- Ah! And my hands? - Hmm...

758
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,428
柔軟,像個嬰兒
Soft, like a baby's bum.

759
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,182
你是最棒的
You're the best.

760
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,956
嘿,傑瑞,我需要幫助
Hey there, Chewey, I need a favour.

761
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,834
我在找地圖上標記的這個村子
I'm looking at a village at this grid marker.

762
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,919
那裡最近有的任何活動. 我不知道
Any events in the last, I don't know,

763
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,171
我是說最近六個月的? 好吧,皮特
say the last six months? Come on, Pete

764
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,258
- 我知道這個要通過阿姆斯特朗,但是我不知道自己尋找的是什麼
- I know I should go through Armstrong, but I don't know what I'm looking for.

765
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,052
我不能憑感覺做事情
I don't feel like doing a whole work up just on a hunch.

766
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,888
- 我想你想要一些可視化的東西 - 是的,任何能看見的
- You want a visual, I assume. - Anything with eyes, yeah.

767
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,390
我會告訴你的
I'll let you know.

768
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,852
謝謝
Thank you.

769
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,921
有用嗎?
Anything useful?

770
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,840
也許
Maybe.

771
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,884
我欠你什麼? 我要你
What do I owe you? I'll take your beer allotment

772
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,637
一個月的啤酒. 我也只有兩箱,和你一樣
at the end of the month. I only get two, same as you.

773
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,640
- 那我就都拿走 - 好吧,歸你了
- And I'll take them both. - Alright, they're yours.

774
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,644
你能把這些都搞清楚嗎? 謝謝,傑瑞
And you can clear all this shit off. Thanks, Chewey.

775
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,732
哦,是的.嗯...這幾天裡
Oh yeah, and, uh... one of these days,

776
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,443
我要策劃一次行動
I'm gonna split up a fire mission,

777
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,195
扭轉局面
turn my chair on the backside.

778
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,327
好的...
Okay...

779
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,082
嘿,哈吉,有什麼新消息嗎?
Hey, Haji, what do you got for me?

780
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,918
哦.很糟.是貝希爾
Oh, it's bad. It's Bashir's.

781
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,337
你開玩笑吧. 那不是巴什 達烏德 可汗的地盤嗎?
You're kidding me. BDK owns that land?

782
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,506
你確定? 記錄上是這樣顯示的
You're sure? It's in the record.

783
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,676
好吧,聽著,你明天能去斯波嗎?
Alright, listen, can you get out to Sper tomorrow?

784
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,261
- 可以,沒問題 - 當你到大門的時候,如果有人問起
- Yes, no problem. - When you're at the gate, if anyone asks,

785
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,681
你就說你是承包商,你在學校工作
you're just a contractor, you're working on a school,

786
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,433
或者...我不知道,工廠或是其他什麼
or... I don't know, a fucking kite factory or something.

787
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,893
好的
Okay.

788
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,687
小心點,朋友
Take care, my friend.

789
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,366
你有乳腺增生
Have you had any tenderness in your breasts,

790
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,411
噁心或者只是濕疹嗎? 有點濕疹
or nausea or just the spotting? No, just the spotting.

791
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,329
我一直控制的不錯啊
I'm really managing my cycle.

792
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:52,791
我有六個月沒來月經了,但是...
I haven't had my period in six months, but...

793
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,168
我也不知道,也許我忘了吃避孕藥,或者...
I don't know, maybe I missed a pill or...

794
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,586
也許我有點偏執了!
maybe I'm just being paranoid!

795
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,213
不...
No...

796
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,715
如果我們發現了什麼...
If we find something...

797
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,302
我們該怎麼辦? 你知道,我應該向上匯報
what do we do? You know I'm supposed to report it.

798
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,222
我們是朋友,求你不要,好嗎?
Well, I'm... asking you not to. As a friend, okay?

799
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,435
天那...
Oh my...

800
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,950
呃...
Ugh...

801
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,578
我的天那
Oh, my God.

802
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,751
好吧...
Okay...

803
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,106
- 喬依怎樣? - 他很好啊
- How's Joey? - (Mary): He's good, you know.

804
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,733
成績單很不錯啊
Report card's off the charts.

805
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:44,319
他很想念你
But he misses the shit out of you.

806
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,197
哦.別了, 親愛的
Oh, come on, honestly.

807
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,699
他真的很想我? 當然了!
He really misses me? Of course he misses you!

808
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,284
我也很想你
Fuck, I miss you.

809
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,915
- 我也想你,寶貝 - 想到什麼程度?
- I miss you too, baby. - How much do you miss me?

810
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,167
非常想念你
Wide-open prairie miss you.

811
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,548
這個呢? 你想嗎?
What about these? You miss them?

812
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,927
哦,天那,你不知道我有多想念啊
Oh, Jesus, you have no idea how much I miss them.

813
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,681
等一下...
Hang on...

814
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,330
我必須回去,因為這個行動
I had to go back because this op

815
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,958
太早了.是排雷部隊發現的
was pretty early in the roto. But yeah, the DETs observed

816
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,252
有15到20名塔利班恐怖份子在那一區域活動
between 15 and 20 Talis moving across the field.

817
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,754
由於實力懸殊,他們不會輕易交火
Because of the force size, they didn't engage.

818
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,464
連隊司令部需要坐標
Company command requested the grid.

819
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,675
他們說,炮擊是最好的辦法
They called it in, artillery beat the shit out of them.

820
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,719
這裡應該有快速空中打擊力量,是吧?
There was some fast air in there as well, right?

821
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,178
是的,我相信有兩架A10s攻擊機
Yeah, I believe so. Two A10s.

822
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,515
- 他們要毀了這個地方?  - 這是他們擅長的
- And they destroyed the field? - That's what Warthogs do.

823
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,768
你看,問題來了.結果是
Well, see, this matters because, as it turns out,

824
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,730
這一地區由巴什 達烏德 可汗控制
the field is owned by Bashir Daoud Khan.

825
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,148
巴什 達烏德 可汗?
BDK?

826
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,776
看,巴什 達烏德 可汗把地租給農民...
See, BDK leases the field to the farmer, who's basically...

827
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,237
他像個奴隸.是嗎?
He's like a slave, right?

828
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,530
農民在地裡工作
The farmer works the field,

829
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,616
到了罌粟收穫的季節
then at the end of the poppy season,

830
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,618
他要上交5000美元
he's gotta hand over 5,000 USD.

831
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,203
不管怎樣,他們要留一點
Whatever he gets on top of that, he gets to keep,

832
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,622
大概800美元
which is probably like 800 bucks,

833
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,956
這是國家的平均水平
somewhere around the national average.

834
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,833
在這個特殊的案例裡
Now in this particular case,

835
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,461
塔利班來到田間
the Talis go running around the field,

836
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,339
政府軍把他們幹掉了
ISAF blows the shit out of it

837
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,591
莊稼也毀了.現在,那些農民
and the crop is ruined. And now, well, the farmer,

838
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,468
他們收入減少了
he's got less than Adam before the apple.

839
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,763
然後,巴什 達烏德 可汗來了,問道:"嘿,我的5000美元呢?"
Well, BDK shows up and goes, "Hello, where's my 5,000 USD?"

840
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,557
農民回答:"莊稼被毀了.你知道嗎?"
And the farmer says, "Well... the crop was ruined, you know?

841
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,225
不是我的責任
No fault of my own."

842
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:43,021
巴什 達烏德 可汗說:"我不管,我是魔鬼.我要我的5000美元"
BDK says, "I don't give a shit, I'm evil. I will have my $5,000.

843
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,732
你有很多時間來準備
And you have X amount of time to come up with it."

844
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,193
喔,這傢伙聽起來像是托尼女高音啊
Wow, this guy sounds like Tony Soprano.

845
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,946
是的,但是沒有調理的
Yeah, but without the therapist.

846
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,864
我們是阿富汗人.我們基本上都沒經過調理
We Afghans, we're not very big on therapy.

847
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,451
好吧,哪裡能找到這個
Alright, so why are we looking

848
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,620
農民? 他叫阿達姆 穆裡克
at this farmer? His name is Abdul Malik.

849
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,374
他父親的名字叫哈吉 穆裡克,沙漠之獅
His father's name is Haji Malik, Lion of the Desert.

850
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,586
他父親就是幽靈? 見鬼!
His father is the Ghost? Holy shit!

851
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,672
我們覺得這就是幽靈返回的原因
We think this is why the Ghost has returned,

852
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,340
要保護家族榮譽
to protect the honour of his family.

853
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,342
巴什 達烏德 可汗和幽靈之間還有些歷史淵源啊
There's some bad history between BDK and the Ghost.

854
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,970
我不想把事情搞亂.因為我需要幽靈
I don't want things to go haywire 'cause I want the Ghost,

855
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,056
我需要他為我們工作.因為他是一個很好的聯盟
I want him to work with us, 'cause he can be a powerful ally

856
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,016
促使我們能到達目的
for what we're trying to achieve down here,

857
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,643
也許我們能真正完成鬣狗大路的建設
maybe we'll actually get Hyena built.

858
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,353
那麼什麼時候合適呢?
So where do I fit in?

859
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,772
我覺得,日子很接近了,不是嗎?
Well, we think the date for payment is close, yeah?

860
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,692
兩三天吧.所以我需要村裡的眼線
Two-three days kinda thing. So I need eyes on that village,

861
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,902
我需要知道他們的出入時間
I need to know about the comings and goings,

862
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,238
和誰,幹什麼,所有一切
the who, the what, all that kind of thing.

863
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,616
我的狙擊手在這裡的活動範圍很大
I got my snipers spread all over the area of operation,

864
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,868
但是我可以重新部署,變更掃雷時間
but I can redeploy, rotate the DETs,

865
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,871
干兩天,停兩天,從今晚開始
two days on, two days off sort of thing, starting tonight.

866
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,832
好極了!
Outstanding!

867
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,379
- 你要確定時間嗎? - 不,謝謝
- You ever try a date? - No, thank you.

868
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,902
- 常規檢查 - 檢查
- Comm check. - Check.

869
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,529
正常
Right.

870
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,114
常規檢查 沃爾夫
Comm check to Wilf.

871
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,615
檢查!收到
Check! Roger you.

872
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,617
- 槍械彈夾檢查? - 檢查
- AKA training magnet? - Check.

873
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,831
- 槍械糟透了 - 檢查
- AKA I smell a shit. - Check.

874
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,001
槍械沒問題
AKA douchebag.

875
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,728
吥!
Brr!

876
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,744
看見什麼了嗎,坦克?
You seen anything, Tank?

877
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,289
- 沒有 - 好吧,休息一會兒
- Negative. - Alright, take a break.

878
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,999
收到
Roger that.

879
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,587
嘿,夥計
Hey, buds.

880
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,092
有什麼要告訴我的嗎?
Is there something you wanna tell me?

881
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:48,016
佩裡 科摩? 在戰區?
Perry Como? In a combat zone?

882
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,768
- 有點混亂 - 算了
- It was on shuffle. - Unacceptable.

883
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:54,397
完全不合適
Completely inappropriate.

884
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,927
你知道,我在想...
You know, I've been thinking about...

885
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,013
你剛說的關於武力改變一切
what you said about changing everything with one bullet.

886
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,516
你真的相信嗎?
You really believe that?

887
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,187
是的,我相信
Yeah, I believe that.

888
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,105
我在這兒,不是嗎?
I'm here, aren't I?

889
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,233
是的
Yeah, yeah.

890
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,528
看這個
Look at this.

891
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:49,160
這是什麼?
Okay, what the fuck is this?

892
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,329
我是個糟糕的舞者
I'm a terrible dancer.

893
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:54,832
你跳的真是太可怕了
You're an unbelievably bad dancer.

894
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,377
但我是個不錯的槍手,一直是
But I'm a great shot, and I've always been,

895
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,087
從我還是個孩子的時候
ever since I was a kid.

896
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,340
槍在我手裡也許不可靠
It might've been irresponsible to put a weapon in my hand,

897
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,716
但是很多人甚至連槍都沒有
but people would get hunting licences,

898
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:05,134
都可以得到打獵執照
they didn't even have a gun,

899
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,262
所以我可以代表他們打獵
just so that I could hunt on their behalf.

900
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,639
我喜歡玩高難度級的射擊遊戲
I used to shoot hard-to-shoot game,

901
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:12,350
桌上堆滿食物,時間很難度過
put food on people's tables when times were hard.

902
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:15,103
長官. 鮑曼上尉要見你們倆
Sir? Captain Bowman wants to see you both.

903
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,063
走吧
We're on.

904
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,781
阿爾法39,這裡是66號
Three Niner Alpha, this is 66 Bravo.

905
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:30,285
66號,這裡是阿爾法39
66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha send, over.

906
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,579
66號,我們發現一個車隊
66 Bravo. We got a convoy heading our way, over.

907
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,124
阿爾法39,說具體一下
Three Niner Alpha, describe the convoy.

908
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,587
66號,有三輛車快速開過來
66 Bravo, three white Suburbans coming in fast.

909
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,464
看起來他們有武裝
Looks like they're up-armoured. Over.

910
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,758
阿爾法39,村子裡發生什麼了?
Three Niner Alpha, what's happening in the village?

911
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,389
66號,沒有任何動靜
66 Bravo, all is quiet, over.

912
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,350
他們還沒準備好,他們...見鬼!
They're not ready, they got no... Goddamn it!

913
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:02,483
- 發生什麼事情了? - 我不知道
- Okay, what's going on here? - I don't know yet.

914
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,944
讓大家就緒,收到
Get everyone up. Roger.

915
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:11,034
我靠.66號.我們發現兩個VIP重要人物在車裡
Holy shit. 66 Bravo, we got two VIPs exiting the vehicle.

916
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,787
一個40歲左右,黑色頭髮,小眼睛
First 40s, black hair, bad dye job, beady little eyes.

917
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,165
你能確認VIP是巴什 達烏德 可汗嗎?
Can he confirm VIP is BDK?

918
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,044
66號,阿爾法39號,是VIP 巴什 達烏德 可汗嗎? 你能確認嗎?
66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha, is VIP BDK? Can you confirm?

919
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,712
66號,確認
66 Bravo confirming.

920
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,049
VIP是巴什 達烏德 可汗
VIP call sign Bravo Delta Kilo.

921
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,551
第二個人是哈米德 沃爾德 可汗
Second civ Hamid Walid Khan,

922
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,970
呼叫威士忌酒店
call sign Hotel Whisky Kilo.

923
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,767
阿爾法39,這裡是66號
Three Niner Alpha, this is 66 Bravo.

924
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,936
我們發現塔利班,四個人
We've got Taliban, counting four.

925
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,230
他和塔利班人在一起?
He's got Talis with him?

926
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,358
像巴什 達烏德 可汗這樣的傢伙兩邊通吃的
A guy like BDK plays both sides of the fence.

927
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,568
66號,阿爾法39,你有許可嗎?
66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha, do you have clearance?

928
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,652
他們帶武器了嗎?
Are they carrying weapons?

929
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,071
週三到週五他和我們在一起
Wednesdays-Fridays he's with us

930
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,739
週二到週三他和塔利班在一起
Tuesdays-Thursdays, he's with the Talis,

931
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,075
休息日,他們販毒
and on days off, they're both running narcotics.

932
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,743
66號
66 Bravo,

933
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,746
不,他們沒有鞋帶武器,但是他們穿著整齊
negative, no weapons, but they're in costume.

934
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,998
黑色頭巾,黑衣人穿短衫
Black turbans, black man jams.

935
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:02,460
這些傢伙沒打算隱藏什麼
These guys are not even trying to hide who they are. Over.

936
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,274
66號,我們發現針對居民的敵對行動
66 Bravo, we have hostile action against civilians.

937
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,735
阿爾法39,請說清"敵對行動"
Three Niner Alpha, clarify "hostile action".

938
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,571
他們抓了孩子.一個小女孩兒
They're taking kids. Little girls.

939
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:32,657
阿爾法39,威脅程度緊急嗎?
Three Niner Alpha, do you have imminent threat, over?

940
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,617
66號,不
66 Bravo, negative,

941
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,285
但是他們把女孩兒
but they are grabbing little girls

942
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,037
抓到車裡了
and dragging them to their trucks.

943
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,301
可以開火嗎? 我已經準備就緒
Authorized to engage? I am getting ready to take the shot.

944
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,053
不,我來說
No, I'm stepping in.

945
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:58,808
66號,這裡是威士忌高爾夫9號.不要亂動
66 Bravo, this is Golf Niner Whisky. Sit tight, over.

946
01:13:58,934 --> 01:13:59,934
什麼?! 幹掉他們!
The fuck?! Take them down!

947
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,146
我們不能行動,除非他們亮出武器
Unless they pull out weapons, we can't get involved.

948
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,649
- 66號,我可以干預的 - 威士忌高爾夫9號,不行
- 66 Bravo, I can intervene. - Golf Niner Whisky, negative.

949
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,609
除非你看到了武器,否則不可以
Unless you see a weapon, do not intervene.

950
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:11,821
66號,他們擄走了孩子
66 Bravo, they are taking little kids.

951
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,990
威士忌高爾夫9號,別輕舉妄動
Golf Niner Whisky, sit tight.

952
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,868
66號,明白.你在和我開玩笑嗎?
66 Bravo, clarify. Are you fucking kidding me?

953
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:20,163
威士忌高爾夫9號,除非你看到武器,否則不許行動
Golf Niner Whisky, unless you see a weapon, do not engage.

954
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,206
- 我們得做點什麼! - 你們只能觀望
- We gotta do something! - Your guys will stand down.

955
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,460
- 天啊! - 不能行動! 靠
- Jesus Christ! - Settle down, Warrant! Fuck.

956
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,884
我靠
F...uck.

957
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,769
- 你越權了! - 你為什麼不反駁?
- You're out of line, here! - Why didn't you override?

958
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,438
因為這是內部行動,是他們自己的事情!
'Cause it's an intel op, it's their call!

959
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,772
交戰規則,你知道的!
Rules of engagement. You know that!

960
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,775
- 那是犯罪啊! - 我們需要談談
- It's a fucking crime! - We need to talk.

961
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,987
不,你知道嗎? 我們很好,我們很好.嘿,米歇爾!
No, you know what? We're good, we're good. Hey, Mitchell!

962
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:55,948
米歇爾,那些女孩什麼樣的,8到10歲的孩子,嗯?
Mitchell, what are those girls, like 8, 10 years old, huh?

963
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,618
我們在那裡嗎? 她們會發生什麼?
And we just stand there? What's gonna happen to them, huh?

964
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,578
她們會被賣掉的,就是要發生在她們身上的事情
They're gonna be sold, that's what's gonna happen.

965
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,538
巴什 達烏德 可汗會把他們交給塔利班
BDK will hand them over to the Talis,

966
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,499
塔利班再把他們弄倒市場上去
the Talis will put them on the market.

967
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,459
不管怎樣,他們要抓大約5個,他們還會繼續
Whatever they get above 5, they're gonna keep,

968
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,378
但是巴什 達烏德 可汗也會得到他的5000美元.之後我就不知道了
but BDK will get his $5,000. And then I don't know,

969
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,630
她們最後的命運...
they're gonna end up in...

970
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,381
在迪拜結婚,糟糕的婚姻,也許更糟
some shitty marriage in Dubai, or worse,

971
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,009
她們也許會在福特 穆罕默德外面的妓院
they're gonna end up sucking dick in some brothel

972
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,302
為客人服務
outside of Fort McMurray.

973
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,513
你知道,這些我們不能干預嗎?
You know this and we don't intervene?

974
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,349
我們不能干預,因為我們沒有收到緊迫的威脅
We didn't intervene because we didn't have imminent threat.

975
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,267
這是交戰規則!
Those are the rules of engagement!

976
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,394
我必須遵守!
I had to make that call!

977
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,605
我們不能干預,因為巴什 達烏德 可汗被高層保護著
We didn't intervene because BDK is protected by a roof

978
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,566
有跡象表明和CIA高層有關!
on top of which is a great big fucking sign that reads CIA!

979
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,277
他是他們的人.現在,你想違背我們的將軍
He's their asset. Now, you wanna bring down our general

980
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,196
把整個戰鬥部隊搞亂?
and fuck up the entire battle group?

981
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,240
別客氣,去吧,打死他吧
Be my guest, go ahead, shoot him.

982
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,325
我們在這裡打的是什麼操蛋的戰爭啊?!
What kind of fucking war are we fighting here?!

983
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,993
哦,別這樣,這不是個簡單的戰爭!
Oh, come on, it's not one war!

984
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,662
這是完全不同的戰爭
It's a whole bunch of different wars.

985
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,539
至於我,就像是3D象棋裡的棋子
And mine, it's like a 3D chess game.

986
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,207
一半的時間,我都不知道
Half the time, I don't even know

987
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,833
和我下棋的對手是誰
who the fuck I'm playing against.

988
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,752
我們不打算在這裡玩遊戲!
We're not playing games here!

989
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,422
不,我們不是
No, we're not.

990
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,967
但是我們不在這裡,孩子們也是可以放飛風箏的
But we're not here so kids can fly kites either.

991
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,010
但是我們在這裡干他媽什麼呢?
Then what the fuck are we doing here?

992
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,554
我們在追索記錄
We are rolling back the clock

993
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,847
這次我們暗中佈局
and we are stacking the deck so this time,

994
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,641
所以那些喪心病狂的傢伙是贏不了的
the complete fucking crazies don't win.

995
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,561
哈吉,你得到了嗎? 是的,繼電器沒問題
Haji, did you get all of that? Yes, the relay was clear.

996
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:13,901
它還需要反應一會兒.它會找到巴達爾的
He's going to have to react. He will make badal.

997
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,447
巴達爾是塔利班另一個重要人物
Okay, badal is another one of those tribal pillars.

998
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,283
坐下吧
Come on, sit down.

999
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,120
請坐
Sit down.

1000
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,875
巴達爾打算,就像...復仇.或者...
Badal basically means, like... revenge, or...

1001
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,919
就像以眼還眼之類的事情
It's like an eye for an eye kinda thing.

1002
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,087
這個更多的是關於榮譽
It's more about honour.

1003
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,591
如果一個家庭的戶主不能重新奪回榮譽的話
If the leader of the family cannot restore honour to them,

1004
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,301
那麼他必須離開,永遠離開
then he must leave, forever.

1005
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,261
所以幽靈沒有選擇,他必須行動
So the Ghost has no choice. He must act.

1006
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,304
事情是這樣的
Here's the thing.

1007
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,765
在和蘇聯的戰爭裡,巴什 達烏德 可汗是幽靈的手下
BDK served under the Ghost in the war against the Russians.

1008
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,101
事情是,蘇聯的直升機被擊落
Story goes that a Russian chopper went down

1009
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:50,354
巴什 達烏德 可汗姦殺了飛行員.作為懲罰
and BDK ass-raped one of the pilots. And as punishment,

1010
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,815
幽靈讓他在其他穆斯林面前很尷尬
the Ghost embarrassed him in front of the rest of the muj.

1011
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,611
- 所以你明白, 巴達爾還在繼續 - 巴什 達烏德 可汗是個壞傢伙
- So you see, badal continues. - BDK is a bad guy

1012
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,237
他需要被幹掉
and he needs to be brought down.

1013
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:01,032
但是我們現在不能做, 但是幽靈可以.為了這個目的
Now we can't do it, but the Ghost can. To do that,

1014
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,783
我們打算支持幽靈
we gotta boost the stature of the Ghost,

1015
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,535
我們打算邀請幽靈
and we're gonna start by inviting the Ghost

1016
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,995
參加鬣狗大路的開通儀式
to the ceremony for Hyena Road.

1017
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,039
把他們放到一起,巴達爾沒問題
Put them together. Badal is possible.

1018
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,708
我還打算提供一個安全屋
I'm also gonna offer up the safe house.

1019
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:12,877
如果他們在鬣狗大路上見面
If they meet on Hyena Road,

1020
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,921
那就是政治環境. 如果他們在安全屋見面,那就是私人恩怨
it's political. If they meet at the safe house, it's personal.

1021
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,673
不管怎樣,他們都會交火的
Either way, there's gonna be fireworks.

1022
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:21,344
好的,一會兒有架飛機要飛回坎大哈空軍基地,大約10到11英里.我要回去
Okay, there's a flight heading back to KAF in about 10-11 Mikes, I'm gonna hop on it.

1023
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,554
我需要你去召集和幽靈的會議
I need you to set up a meeting with the Ghost,

1024
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,056
在我們的安全屋裡
we'll do it at the safe house.

1025
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:27,516
我需要你的隊伍負責安全保衛
And I need your team to scope out security

1026
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,894
在儀式上和安全屋裡
at the ceremony site and at the safe house.

1027
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,522
瑞恩...
Ryan...

1028
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,232
瑞恩...
Ryan...

1029
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:40,571
別以為我不關心那些女孩兒.其實我想著呢
Don't think I don't feel for those girls, 'cause I do.

1030
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,366
我會去盡力尋找她們的
And we'll do what we can to find them.

1031
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,870
但是現在,最重要的是,我們需要幽靈
But right now, in the bigger picture, we need the Ghost.

1032
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,913
特拉維斯說你在找我
Travis said you were looking for me.

1033
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,082
是的...
Yeah...

1034
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,002
好吧,我很抱歉.我失去了理智
Alright, look, I'm sorry, I lost my shit.

1035
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,590
但你知道我的.你知道,大多數時間
But you know me. And you know that most of the time,

1036
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,259
我為我做過的事情感到很驕傲
I'm proud about what we do here

1037
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,719
也為我們將要做的事情感到很驕傲
and I'm proud about how we go about doing it,

1038
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,555
但是...她們是孩子
but... those were kids.

1039
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:56,976
如果我們不提供幫助,那麼我們做這些事情的意義在哪兒?
If we can't help them, what's the point of doing all this?

1040
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,229
我不知道答案是什麼,也不知道到底哪個更值得
I don't... have an answer for that, and for what it's worth,

1041
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,439
我同意你的觀點,但是這並不是...
I agree with you, but that's not, um...

1042
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,483
我要見你的目的是
what I wanted to see you about.

1043
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,863
嗯,你介意把門關上嗎?
Uh, do you mind just... closing the door?

1044
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,497
嗯...
Uh...

1045
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,709
坐,我給你看點東西
Have a seat, I just have to show you something.

1046
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:39,894
這是什麼?
What's this?

1047
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,314
嗯,是我們的孩子
Uh, that's our baby.

1048
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,318
我猜是...塞浦路斯...
It was... Cyprus, I guess.

1049
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,914
這是我見過最美麗的東西了
It's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.

1050
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,920
最美麗的東西
The most beautiful thing.

1051
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:11,008
這能改變不少事情,不是嗎?
This kind of changes things... doesn't it?

1052
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:12,217
是的,這能改變很多事情
Yeah, yeah, it changes everything.

1053
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,553
我覺得...你知道的,就我來說
I think that... you know, in terms of the brass,

1054
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,431
我們會沒事的,因為我們離開後才會生
we're gonna be okay because it happened while we were on leave,

1055
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:21,101
但是要想想今後的打算
but we gotta figure out what we're... gonna do.

1056
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:24,146
想想今後的打算?
Figure out what we're gonna do?

1057
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,443
我們有了孩子
We're gonna have a baby.

1058
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,988
這是你想要的嗎?
Is that what you want?

1059
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:39,703
是的,這當然是我想要的,比任何事情都重要
Yeah, of course it's what I want, more than anything.

1060
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:42,915
好吧,我很高興
Okay, good, I'm glad.

1061
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,250
你知道嗎,你搞的我快瘋了
You know, you're making me crazy.

1062
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:49,046
我知道,我也把自己搞瘋了
I know, I'm making myself crazy.

1063
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:52,841
- 你覺得我會怎麼想的? - 我不知道,我只是...
- What did you think I'd think? - I don't know, I just was...

1064
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,177
我很緊張.我不知道
I was nervous. We didn't...

1065
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,682
...事情發展的還不錯
...leave things very well.

1066
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,976
過來,過來,嘿...
Come here, come here, come here. Hey...

1067
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,979
我們有孩子了
We're gonna have a baby.

1068
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,860
哦!你確定是我的嗎?
Oh! Oh! You sure it's mine?

1069
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:32,006
戰術99號在基地
Niner Niner Tac on base.

1070
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:42,307
靠! 又有一個掃雷隊員在鬣狗大路遭到襲擊
Cocks! Another IED hit out on Hyena.

1071
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:46,186
一個反政府武裝人員,從喀布爾來的一個傢伙,開了幾槍?
One KIA. A guy out of Kabul, father of how many, Shorty?

1072
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:48,522
- 5槍,長官 - 5槍,靠
- Five, sir. - Five. Fuck.

1073
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,443
找到這些傢伙就像往牆上釘釘子一樣
Finding these pricks is like nailing Jell-O to the wall.

1074
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:56,822
我們建造鬣狗大路,不能再有人員傷亡了
I cannot keep losing civilians if we're gonna get Hyena built.

1075
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:59,742
如果我們想在那裡取勝的話...
And if we're gonna prevail down there...

1076
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,368
鬣狗大路必須完成
Hyena's gotta go through.

1077
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,788
我要去那兒,在地面上
I gotta get out there, on the ground,

1078
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:06,165
用豹II式坦克
gotta get my Leopard 2s rolling,

1079
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,083
把他們炸飛
and blow them fuckers out of their beds.

1080
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,919
我要找到他們的彈藥庫
I gotta find their weapons caches,

1081
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,921
我要幹掉他們的指揮中心
I gotta fuck with their command and control

1082
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,507
我不能從直升飛機上做這件事
and I cannot do that bouncing around in goddamn helicopters.

1083
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,634
這樣動靜太大,皮特
That's a kinetic imperative, Pete.

1084
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,220
我需要你的人用安靜點的方式去做
I'm gonna need a little help from you non-kinetic types.

1085
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,973
我需要你的人去那裡,按你的方式
I need you effects guys going there and work your magic.

1086
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:25,934
明白,長官.我們正在為此努力
Understood, sir. We are working on it.

1087
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,771
我的阿富汗內線告訴我,巴什 達烏德 可汗是事情的幕後指使
My Afghan guys tell me that BDK's behind all of this shit.

1088
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,230
安全形勢越惡化
The more the security situation deteriorates,

1089
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,858
他們得到的錢越多
the more money he's making out of all the gravel trucks,

1090
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,985
還有一些其他感興趣的東西
all the other stuff he's into us for.

1091
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,112
- 可惡的傢伙 - 如果不是因為他
- Fucking horrible little man. - If he was out of the picture,

1092
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,365
完成鬣狗大路會容易很多
getting Hyena through would be a hell of a lot easier.

1093
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,160
他被收拾.我是不會為之流淚的
He gets knocked of his perch, I would not weep.

1094
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,370
明白.長官
Understood, sir.

1095
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,413
我聽說幽靈回來了
I hear the Ghost's back.

1096
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:48,373
- 是的,長官 - 有威脅嗎?
- Yes, sir. - See a threat?

1097
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,667
恰恰相反.我覺得他是個很有利的同盟
Just the opposite. I think he could be a powerful ally.

1098
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,252
我不管你怎麼幹
I don't care how you do it,

1099
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,421
要保證我的人不會受傷
just make sure my civilians aren't getting hit

1100
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:56,924
他們每次都是開輛破卡車過去
every time they drive a fucking truck down there.

1101
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,510
- 明白,長官 - 謝謝,皮特
- Understood, sir. - Thanks, Pete.

1102
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,398
哈吉,你在幹什麼呢?
Haji, what the fuck are you doing?

1103
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,193
什麼? 你都無法通過玻璃看東西了
What? You can't see out of these things!

1104
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,653
這裡沒什麼可看的啊
There's nothing to see.

1105
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,197
不,不是這樣的,不!
No, not the way they are, no!

1106
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:23,867
好吧...聯絡幽靈,繼續那個會議
Okay... Get in touch with the Ghost, the meeting's on.

1107
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:25,119
你得到許可了?
You have approval?

1108
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:28,539
尋求原諒總比徵得同意更好些
It's always better to ask for forgiveness than permission,

1109
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,832
你知道的
you know that.

1110
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,168
我們在安全屋見
We'll meet him at the safe house.

1111
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,512
這個房子有個重要特點
This house has a key feature.

1112
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:27,681
它是我們的安全屋
It's our asset, a safe house.

1113
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:31,059
我們會在山脊處設置觀察員
We'll set up our OP here, at the summit of the saddle back ridge.

1114
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:34,605
那裡可以看清山兩邊的情況
That'll give us clear line of sight to both sides of the hill:

1115
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,065
這裡是安全屋
here, at the safe house,

1116
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,610
這裡是慶祝儀式的地點
and here, where the ceremony's gonna take place.

1117
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,153
- 範圍是多少? - 很合適
- What's the range? - It's comfortable,

1118
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,989
山兩邊1150米,750米
1, 150, 750 metres both sides of the hill.

1119
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:45,407
那關於撤離地點呢?
And what about extraction?

1120
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,911
我們從後面撤離,經過葡萄地
We'll exfil down the back side, through the grape fields

1121
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,954
他們在鬣狗大路上接我們
and get picked up en route Hyena.

1122
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,456
安全屋做什麼用?
How's this house gonna play?

1123
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,334
這個不知道
That's unknown.

1124
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,712
有一個提議是讓幽靈和巴什 達烏德 可汗接洽
There's an offer out to the Ghost and BDK to show.

1125
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:01,089
他們可能在安全屋進行
Intel thinks they'll show up either at the safe house

1126
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,299
也可能在儀式上
or at the ceremony,

1127
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,927
所以我們兩邊都要照看
so we need eyes on both.

1128
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,847
這是一次重要的行動,所以我來指揮
This is a tricky op, so I'll take lead.

1129
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,433
沃爾夫,你跟著我
Wilf, you'll stand this one down.

1130
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,061
好的,讓我們準備一下吧
Alright, let's gear up.

1131
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,106
我很感謝你能見我
I would like to thank you for meeting with me.

1132
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,488
他說:"這是我的榮幸"
He says, "The honour is mine."

1133
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,669
他說:"我來這裡感到很驚訝
He says, "I'm surprised to be here.

1134
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,921
我來這裡很多次了"
I used to come to this house many times."

1135
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,340
他問:"你知道這裡是誰的房子嗎?"
He's asking, "Do you know who used to own this house?"

1136
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:44,925
穆勒 奧瑪
Mullah Omar.

1137
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:55,018
他的耳朵保住了,眼睛卻沒了
He saved his ears, but he lost his eye.

1138
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:57,562
- 這是什麼意思? - 同樣的
- What does that mean? - Same same.

1139
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,023
- 什麼同樣的? - 同樣的
- Same same what? - Same same, same same.

1140
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,820
不管什麼原因你要使用這裡
If you ever need to use this house for whatever reason,

1141
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,489
請儘管用
it's yours.

1142
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:12,286
那天在潘吉發生了一件事
There was an event in Panjaway the other day,

1143
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:13,996
哈吉 巴巴村
the village of Haji Baba.

1144
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,249
有兩個女孩兒被搶走了
Two little girls were taking out of the arms or their father.

1145
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,842
他說:"你為什麼不來找我"
He says, "Why have you come to me?"

1146
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:30,512
因為女孩兒是被巴什 達烏德 可汗搶走的
Because the little girls were taken by Bashir Daoud Khan.

1147
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:39,187
我的將軍是一個富有同情心的人
My general is a compassionate man.

1148
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,815
他是普什圖瓦裡的學生
He's a student of Pashtunwali.

1149
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:45,193
他想幫助你,幫助阿富汗
And he would like to help you, to help all Afghans,

1150
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,529
幫助哈吉 巴巴村
to help the village of Haji Baba.

1151
01:28:57,123 --> 01:29:00,542
他很希望你能收下這個禮物
And he would be very honoured if you would accept this gift:

1152
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:03,420
5000美元
5,000 US dollars.

1153
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,925
他也很希望你能參加
He will also be honoured if you would attend

1154
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,012
鬣狗大路的開通儀式
the ceremony for Hyena Road.

1155
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,150
他說:"為什麼是我? 我只是個種葡萄的"
He's saying, "Why me? I'm a simple grape farmer."

1156
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:27,694
他理解,但是你是出席
He understands this, but your presence would do him

1157
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,405
讓他感到十分的榮幸
a great honour as an elder of the region.

1158
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,371
"還有誰去?"
"Who else will be there?"

1159
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,041
巴什 達烏德 可汗
Bashir Daoud Khan.

1160
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,599
"我在巴什還是個孩子的時候我就認識他"
 "I have known this man Bashir since he was a boy."

1161
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,071
"他做了很丟臉的事情
"He brought great dishonour to our cause,

1162
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,448
我親自懲罰了他"
and he was punished by my own hands."

1163
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,508
"感謝將軍的好意
"Thank your general for his kindness,

1164
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:34,428
我能參加也很榮幸"
and it will be my honour to attend."

1165
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:46,231
他說:"小雞討厭你"
He says, "The chicken hates you."

1166
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:52,737
是的,哈吉, 是我
Yeah, Haji, it's me.

1167
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,030
是的...
Yeah...

1168
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,074
我正看著他走過小山
I'm watching him walk up the side of a mountain.

1169
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,534
是的,他打算參加
Yeah, he says he's gonna show up,

1170
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,870
但是我感覺他袖子裡有什麼東西
but I got the feeling he's got something up his sleeve,

1171
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,706
所以,我需要你特別留意
so I'm gonna need you to get your eyes and ears out there,

1172
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,166
看看能發現什麼,好嗎?
see what you can learn, okay?

1173
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,460
是的...
Yeah...

1174
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,882
好的,帶上東西,出發
Okay, let's get our gear, we're going.

1175
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:29,691
喔! 當地肉類?
Whoa! Local meat?

1176
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,070
神聖的神父...
Heavenly Father...

1177
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,116
請保護這些小女孩兒
Please protect those little girls.

1178
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:43,121
照看他們,把他們帶回家
Watch over them and bring them home.

1179
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,807
嘿...
Hi...

1180
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:05,393
嘿,聽著,我不是很確定,也不十分清楚
Hi, listen, I'm not sure I was entirely clear about all this,

1181
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,354
所以我得說出來
so I want to spell it out.

1182
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:10,941
我非常想...
I'd like it very much if, um...

1183
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,528
你能嫁給我嗎,鮑曼上尉
you'd marry me, Captain Bowman.

1184
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:20,534
我也非常希望如此. 桑德斯准尉
I would also like that very much, Warrant Officer Sanders.

1185
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:34,089
好的,我要走了.我們要出發了.我還有裝備
Okay, I gotta go. We're heading out. I gotta kit up.

1186
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,509
哦,為什麼我不能幫你拿裝備呢
Oh, why don't I... help you with that kit.

1187
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,571
哦...我們太瘋狂了
Oh... we're crazy.

1188
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,574
去它的什麼證明
Fucking certifiable.

1189
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,787
小心點
Be careful.

1190
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,415
我保證
I promise.

1191
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,010
他讓我發瘋!
You're driving me crazy!

1192
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:27,892
上帝啊...
My God...

1193
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:29,811
哦,靠...
Oh, fucking...

1194
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,835
嘿,珍
Hey, Jen.

01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:56,463
嘿,你覺得該如何演繹?
Hey, hey. So how do you think this is gonna play out?

1196
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,256
哦,很難說,變數很大
Oh, hard to say, a lot of variables.

1197
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:00,467
如果計劃有把握,我們就贏了
If the plan holds, we're golden.

1198
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,052
也許有變化,誰知道呢
Anything shifts, who knows.

1199
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,845
戰術99號已經上路,長官

You were down at the ceremony site?

1202
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,310
是的,要去的.一群亂七八糟的人
Yeah, on my way here. Usual motley crew.

1203
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:12,646
到處是山羊,漫山遍野的糞便
Goats everywhere, shit all over the goddamn place.

1204
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:14,689
你知道我想看見什麼嗎?
You know what I'd like to see?

1205
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:17,525
我想看見這個國家能舉辦奧運會
I'd like to see this country host the Olympics,

1206
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,235

他們不會來的

哦,我覺得他們會來的,長官.這對他們很重要
Oh, I think they'll be there, sir. It's important to them.

66, Niner Niner Tac has landed, over.

1223
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,563
你欠我25美元.你知道嗎?
You're gonna owe me 25 bucks. You realize that, don't you?

1224
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:39,065
我是個樂觀主義者,長官

你是個傻瓜,肖蒂

1227
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,665
阿爾法39,我是66號
Three Niner Alpha, 66,

1228
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:58,418
在路上發現車隊
I have convoy in sight on approach road, over.

1229
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,837
阿爾法39,是白色的SUV嗎? 確認
Three Niner Alpha, white SUVs? Confirm.

66, convoy has turned north off approach road,

1232
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,936
向安全屋的方向去了

阿爾法39,收到

Okay, everybody, we're on. BDK's going for it.

1235
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:23,443
幽靈和巴什 達烏德 可汗要在安全屋見面
The Ghost and BDK will meet at the safe house,

1236
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:24,694
不在儀式地點
not at the ceremony site,

1237
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,488
所以會演變成私人恩怨
so this is probably gonna get personal.

1238
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,406
你拿到繼電器了嗎?

One One Zulu, Golf Niner Whisky, negative.

1250

你能一個一個的弄嗎?
Can you just feed them to us one by one, over?

1251
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,328
他們在幹什麼?
What are you doing?

1252
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,038
他們在監聽他們的手機
He's turning their cellphones into listening devices,

1253
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,290

幽靈走出來了
call sign Ghost is stepping out.

1264
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,178
幽靈獨自一人
Call sign Ghost is alone.

1265
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:17,974
他不應該獨自一人.他應該有同伴的
He shouldn't be alone. He should have guys with him.

1266
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,059
那麼這是什麼意思?
So what does that mean?

1267
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,405
幽靈說,巴什讓他們的
The Ghost says that Bashir has insulted

1268
01:38:32,531 --> 01:38:33,781
家族蒙羞
the honour of his family.

1269
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:37,410
對於一個年輕人,一個學生,這是罪大惡極
For a young man, a former student, this is a great sin.

1270
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:45,168

巴什感謝了他
Bashir thanks him

1273
01:38:53,135 --> 01:38:55,094
還說這就解決了錢的問題
and says this will satisfy the question of the money.

1274
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:03,895
幽靈說,是的
The Ghost says yes,

1275
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,730
但是債務還沒結束
but the debt is not yet resolved.

1276
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,232
他要他的孫女,小女孩兒
He wants his grandchildren, the little girls

1277
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,818
被抓走了. 他需她們回來

1278
01:39:16,575 --> 01:39:19,160
巴什說,這不可能
Bashir says this is impossible.

1279
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:21,454
孩子走了,幽靈應該知道這些
The girls are gone, and the Ghost should know this.

1280
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:24,582
- 這太操蛋了 - 收到
- This is so fucked up. - Copy that.

1281
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:33,257
巴什說,他的兒子哈密德失蹤了
Bashir says that his son Hamid is missing.

1282
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,927
"他的兒子?" 怎麼還有這樣的事情?
"His son"? How the fuck did I not have this intel?

1283
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:44,727
好吧,巴什生氣了
Alright, Bashir is angry.

1284
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:47,230
他說,他也希望他的兒子能回來
He says he wants his son returned to him.

1285
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,816
他說,他要見他的兒子

1286
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:59,409
幽靈說,"那你應該"
The Ghost says, "And so you shall."

1287
01:40:13,465 --> 01:40:16,676
天那,阿爾法39,這裡是66號,我看見一個人頭
Jesus. Three Niner Alpha, 66, I have a head,

1288
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:18,928
在地上有一個人頭
a human fucking head lying on the ground.

1289
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:21,431
靠
Fuck.

1290
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:25,518
那是他的兒子,呼叫威士忌酒店
It's the son, call sign Hotel Whisky Kilo.

1291
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:28,146
我靠,巴什 達烏德 可汗該急了
Shit, shit, shit, BDK is gonna react.

1292
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:30,523
好吧,他們不能交火
Okay, look, they must not engage.

1293
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,734
66號,我是阿爾法39,巴什 達烏德 可汗在幹什麼?
66, Three Niner Alpha, what is BDK doing?

1294
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,318
有敵對意圖嗎?
Do you have hostile intent?

1295
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,075
我們發現武器
We got a weapon.

1296
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:43,536
66號,巴什有武器

1297
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:46,039

66, Golf Niner Whisky, call sign Ghost was seeking

死得很有榮耀...

1331
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,874
你卻阻止了這一切!

1332
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,959
- 我們剛剛救了他 - 這不是你們該做的!
- We saved his life. - It wasn't yours to save!

01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:57,378
現在,他沒有價值了! 你知道嗎? 他沒有用了!
Now, he's got nothing! You understand that? He has nothing!

我認為比這個複雜很多

1339
01:43:18,483 --> 01:43:20,818
怎麼可能?

1428
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:59,420
阿富汗的成年男人都是你舅舅?
Is every single adult male in Afghanistan your uncle?

1429
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,381
- 是的 - 太神奇了

1430

我要去喀布爾待一段時間

1431
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:05,634
去看看你的家人?

1432
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,429
坎大哈最近有些瘋狂

1433

我在這裡沒有很多朋友

1439
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,156
你有我啊.我是你的朋友

1445
01:54:19,477 --> 01:54:22,062
亞歷山大是過去三年裡
Alexander the Great fought a counter-insurgency

1446
01:54:22,188 --> 01:54:24,565
阿富汗偉大的反恐先鋒
in Afghanistan that lasted almost three years.

1447
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:26,525
經過這麼多年
And by the end of those years,

1448
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,569
他酗酒,還有些偏執
he was drinking heavily and completely paranoid.

1449
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,362
一天夜裡,他和一個忠實的朋友

1450
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,948

with a guy named Cleitus the Black, a loyal friend.

1451
01:54:33,074 --> 01:54:35,075
克萊圖斯控告了他
Cleitus accused him of certain things

1452
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:37,953
亞歷山大給了他胸口一槍

1453
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:40,747
他看著自己的朋友死去,自己也失去了理智
As he watched his friend die, he lost his mind.

1454
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:43,417
五年後,亞歷山大也死了
Five years later, Alexander was dead.

1455
01:54:47,505 --> 01:54:48,881
阿富汗人說:
As the Afghans say:

1456
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:51,758
你也許能得到時鐘
you might have the clocks,

1457
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:53,886
但你留不住時間
