1
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:21,854
(indistinct radio communication)

2
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,767
(man): Kandahar Province,
southern Afghanistan,

3
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,602
the birthplace of the Taliban.

4
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,314
It's 54,000 square kilometres
of brutal insurgency,

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:09,902
conflicting agendas,
tribal rivalry and blood feuds.

6
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:14,531
This is the Canadian Forces'
area of operation. We wear it.

7
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,200
And every day, we drive deeper

8
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,993
into the furnace
of enemy country.

9
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,163
It's one hell of a rough road.

10
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,376
(soft music, chanting)

11
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:39,032
Three Niner Alpha, this is 66.

12
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,162
66, this is Three Niner Alpha.
Send. Over.

13
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,249
66. I have contact. Over.

14
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,834
Three Niner Alpha, roger.

15
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:54,047
(whispering):
About 15 left to one.

16
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,927
Wind gusts 15 to 20.
Left to right.

17
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,599
Old left-hand-sided target.

18
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:05,684
On.

19
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,856
The buddy's got a shovel.

20
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,568
- Could be a farmer.
- On a road?

21
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,903
Why not?

22
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,321
'Cause it's a road, man.

23
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:18,864
Could be a real shitty farmer

24
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,532
who's, like, constantly
puzzled, you know?

25
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:23,702
He's in the village asking,
"Why are my crops so lousy?"

26
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,829
And no one has the heart
to say, "Hey, buddy...

27
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,290
you can't grow, like...

28
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,500
anything on a road."

29
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,710
Will you shut the fuck up?

30
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:40,928
Bad move. He's got a
shell casing shaped like a 122,

31
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,388
orange det cord
sticking out of the nose.

32
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:45,265
Three Niner Alpha, this is 66.

33
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:48,101
I have PID, positive ID
on one times insurgent.

34
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,063
Time of contact 10:28 local.

35
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,107
66, this is Three Niner Alpha.
Over.

36
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,526
Three Niner Alpha, 66. Sitrep.

37
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:59,112
One times insurgent,
grey man jams,

38
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,449
black head dress, holding
a 122 mm shell casing

39
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,160
with orange det cord
emanating from the top.

40
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:07,162
Emanating?

41
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,123
Coming out of the top.

42
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,126
And now he's placing
the projectile into the hole.

43
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,129
One Road Hyena. 650 meters
to the north-north-west

44
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,549
of grid Quebec Quebec 4176-8134.

45
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:22,344
Three Niner Alpha,
acknowledged.

46
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,810
When he stands back up,
engage.

47
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:31,937
Standby.

48
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,160
Send it.
(gunshot)

49
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:53,875
(soulful Arabic music)

50
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,719
Three Niner Alpha, 66.

51
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,178
Three Niner Alpha, send.

52
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:08,765
One times insurgent engaged
in centre mass. No motion.

53
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,977
At grid Quebec Quebec
4176-8134.

54
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:19,484
Moving to RV extraction
at grid Quebec Quebec 4199-8226.

55
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,405
Three Niner Alpha,
roger that, 66.

56
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:24,823
One times insurgent VSA.

57
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,700
We are pushing higher assets
to confirm.

58
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,952
66, roger. ¦¥xfiling now.

59
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,787
Three Niner Alpha, roger.
Your ride's en route.

60
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,372
Three One Charlie,
this is Three Niner.

61
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:33,540
Move now.
Three One Charlie.

62
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,917
We're on the move.
Pick them up in 10 Mikes.

63
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,444
Higher assets confirmation:

64
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,283
one times insurgent KIA
at grid Quebec Quebec 4176-8134.

65
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,613
What's up?

66
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:52,285
Take a look at that culvert.

67
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,497
Covers a stretch of road out
50 metres to the left.

68
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:59,709
Three One Charlie, this is 66.
What's your ETA?

69
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:03,130
66, Three One Charlie.
We're 3-4 Mikes the other side of the hill.

70
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,549
Three One Charlie, this is 66.
Advise you hold your position.

71
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,385
Do not crest the hill. I say
again, do not crest the hill.

72
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:09,970
We've got something weird
on the road.

73
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,471
Gonna have a look.
Wait out.

74
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,057
66, Three One Charlie.
Good copy.

75
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,032
Hickey, get the Coyote
on the patch just 10 meters

76
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:33,743
left of that culvert,
put a round in it.

77
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,251
(sighs)

78
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,379
(gunshot)

79
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,469
What do you think?

80
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,888
It's probably nothing.

81
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,934
Hickey, put a round
in that patch next to it.

82
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,561
(sighs)

83
00:08:06,068 --> 00:08:07,903
(gunshot)

84
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,162
Could be just
a bad patch of road.

85
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,207
- What if you're wrong?
- When have I ever been wrong?

86
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,126
- My sister.
- Yeah, that was bad.

87
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:26,796
Hickey, just for fun,
chamber up a Raufuss.

88
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:29,090
Line up on that patch
dead ahead of us.

89
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,510
Let's see what
an incendiary does.

90
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,150
Standby.

91
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:48,985
Send it.

92
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,530
(gunshot)

93
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,115
(explosion)

94
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,578
You okay?
Yeah. Fuck!

95
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,539
(panting)

96
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:08,338
We're blown.
(gunshot)

97
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,424
(shouting in Arabic)

98
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:14,844
(all shouting)
(gunfire)

99
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,643
- Ambush!
- Go, go, go!

100
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,896
- Go! Get the fuck outta there!
- Covering!

101
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,898
(gunfire)

102
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,027
- Move it!
- Covering!

103
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,036
Covering!

104
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,296
- Leaving!
- Leaving!

105
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,054
(panting)

106
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,474
Three Niner Alpha,
this is 66. Sitrep.

107
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,102
We are being effectively
engaged. ¦¥xfiling now. Over.

108
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,979
- Three Niner Alpha, roger. Out.
- We got a TIC,

109
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,147
we got troops in contact.

110
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,690
Three One Charlie,
Three Niner Alpha.

111
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,317
Did you acknowledge last
from 66?

112
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,444
Three One Charlie, roger that.
Moving out now.

113
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,279
66. Negative.
Do not crest the hill.

114
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,740
The road is filled with IEDs.
You're the target.

115
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,200
Can you circle the ridge,
get us on the back side?

116
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:20,243
Three one Charlie, roger.

117
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,537
But it's two zero,
two five Mikes at best.

118
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,123
Break Break. 66, Three Niner
Alpha. What's the force size?

119
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:27,500
66. Two zero
to two five hostiles.

120
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,628
Am seeking strong point.
Wait out.

121
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:30,837
Fuck!

122
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,131
- They're still on us!
- Fuck!

123
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:34,883
- Motherfucker!
- They got us cut off!

124
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,010
We need to find
a strong point!

125
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,637
I got a village!

126
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,974
66, we're moving
at the grape field.

127
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,601
We'll strong-point from there.
Wait out.

128
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,686
(gunfire, shouting)

129
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:55,236
Moving!

130
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,572
Covering!

131
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,783
Fuck!
We're blocked, we're blocked!

132
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:00,825
Go that way!

133
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,661
Over the wall! Come on!

134
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,039
- Cover!
- Go, Tank!

135
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:08,375
- Let's go!
- Go, go, go!

136
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,211
- On my 6!
- Go, go, go!

137
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,088
(shouting)

138
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,675
- We got a door!
- Move, move!

139
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:20,970
Changing mags!

140
00:11:21,097 --> 00:11:23,723
(all shouting)
(insurgents yelling)

141
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,395
- Check your back!
- Check your back!

142
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,063
Covering!

143
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,234
- Covering!
- Covering!

144
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,951
Tank, Hickey, go!

145
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,411
Go, go, go!

146
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,997
- Go, go! Argh!
- Covering! Go!

147
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,586
- We got a door straight ahead!
- Go!

148
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,089
Fuck! It's blocked!

149
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:57,841
(panting)

150
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,136
66, Three Niner Alpha.
Send sitrep. Over.

151
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,596
- 66.
- Covering!

152
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,890
We still have contact.
We're moving into village,

153
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:08,268
will strong-point from there,
Send grid, over.

154
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,770
- Get Lavigne on Zero, ASAP.
- You're with Zero, ma'am.

155
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,605
Zero, this is
Three Niner Alpha.

156
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:15,525
I've got troops in contact.
Force size: two five insurgents.

157
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:16,818
Request fast air.
Over.

158
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:19,237
Three Niner Alpha,
this is Zero. Roger that.

159
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:20,905
We'll see what we got
in the air.

160
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,032
TAC-P, what lines
are we flying right now?

161
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,034
- A 2-ship, not in range.
- Get 'em there. Push 'em hard.

162
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,078
Fires, get me a PSS-SOF grid.
Roger that.

163
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,497
(gunfire)

164
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,417
66, this is Three Niner Alpha.

165
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,377
Convoy's en route
and Zero's pushing fast air,

166
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:37,130
but you're gonna have to hang in there.
66, acknowledged, over.

167
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:39,716
We gotta find another
point of entrance!

168
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,679
RPG!

169
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,478
There's an opening!
(all shouting)

170
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,813
Thank you, Mister Taliban!

171
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,774
(villagers shouting
in foreign language)

172
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,610
(Arabic)

173
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,781
(panting, shouting)
Clear!

174
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,784
Hank, Hick!

175
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,203
(door creaking)

176
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:10,663
Clear! Clear!

177
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,793
- Clear!
- Let's go!

178
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:17,879
It's all clear!

179
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,594
Alright, Ryan, we got
a compound, dead up there.

180
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,304
(Ryan, indistinct)
Roger that. Go!

181
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,806
Moving!

182
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:29,516
(gunfire)
Contact grid!

183
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,683
- Moving!
- Covering!

184
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,477
Covering!

185
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,232
- Covering!
- Moving!

186
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,820
(villagers shouting)

187
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,241
- Clear!
- Clear!

188
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,495
(panting)
Clear!

189
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,914
- Clear!
- Clear!

190
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,251
(panting)

191
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,343
(foreign language)

192
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,145
(all): Grenade!

193
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,609
(explosion)

194
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,824
- They're surrounding us!
- Three Niner Alpha.

195
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,284
Send sitrep. Over.

196
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,037
- Inviting us in?
- I think he wants to help.

197
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,498
66. Three Niner Alpha.
Sitrep, please.

198
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,668
66, send sitrep. Over.

199
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:40,795
Three Niner Alpha, 66.

200
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,213
Three Niner Alpha, send.

201
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,425
66, we're hold up inside
compound at grid... Travis!

202
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,176
Quebec, Quebec, 4133...

203
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:50,555
Quebec, Quebec, 4133-8921.

204
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,975
We have a section plus of
insurgents encircling compound.

205
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:58,563
We need QRF extraction
for 4 PAX, ASA-fucking-P.

206
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,274
We got an elder with crazy eyes,
he's uh...

207
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,484
he's asking us inside.
I'm moving in.

208
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,486
We'll strong-point from here.
Over.

209
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,323
- Did he say crazy eyes?
- Yeah.

210
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,742
Can I get a description
of the elder?

211
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,285
66, this is Zero.

212
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,621
Describe the friendly.
66, did you not hear me?

213
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,039
We need QRF extraction now!

214
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,206
It's important.

215
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,251
66, I say again,
describe the friendly.Over.

216
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,671
66, elder is about, uh...

217
00:15:23,797 --> 00:15:27,759
I don't know, he's Afghan old.
Weird eyes, different colours.

218
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,260
Break, break.
Zero, they're jammed here,

219
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:30,637
we gotta get them out!

220
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,639
Three Niner Alpha,
we're pushing. Will advise.

221
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,475
Fuck!
(sighing)

222
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,061
(shouting in foreign language)

223
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:41,147
Let's move in! Come on!
Let's move in!

224
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,944
- Clear!
- Clear!

225
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,948
Everybody take a quarter.

226
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,536
Three Niner Alpha, 66 looking
for status on that ride home.

227
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,581
66, Three Niner Alpha,
QRF is two zero Mikes out

228
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,166
and you are danger close
for artillery.

229
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,961
You'll have to hunker down.
We'll get you out of there ASAP.

230
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,005
66, roger, out.
We're on our own.

231
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,801
- They can't get anything to us?
- Not for a while. Okay, guys, let's arm up.

232
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:29,904
What the fuck?

233
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,158
(foreign language)

234
00:16:40,457 --> 00:16:42,083
Grenade.
We need a grenade.

235
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:43,710
I got one. Here.

236
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,511
(foreign language)

237
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,768
What do you think
they're doing?

238
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,729
Same as us, getting ready.

239
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,313
(foreign language)

240
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,075
You see anything?
They got an 82 recoilless!

241
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,452
Oh, great.

242
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,914
(exhaling)

243
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,919
(explosion)

244
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:29,047
(coughing)

245
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,926
- Everybody okay?
- Good!

246
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,470
- I'm good.
- You?

247
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,264
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

248
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:46,230
(elder shouting
in foreign language)

249
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,149
(gunfire in the distance)

250
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,567
They killed him!

251
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,947
- Gents, it's been a privilege.
- Likewise.

252
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,658
Kill every fucker
that comes through those doors!

253
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:58,951
Roger that.

254
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,121
(cocking rifles)

255
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,082
(rhythmic music)

256
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,504
Hold your fire!

257
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,971
Taliban?
No Taliban.

258
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,348
(foreign language)

259
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:21,724
We're safe?

260
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,476
(foreign language)

261
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,646
You trust him?

262
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:28,648
Let's gear up!

263
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,236
Let's go!

264
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,369
(foreign language)

265
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,620
Thank you.

266
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,330
- Clear!
- Clear!

267
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,590
Clear!

268
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,176
Clear!

269
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,347
Where the hell'd they go?

270
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,724
Three Niner Alpha, 66,
we're clear in the village.

271
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:07,353
Moving to rendezvous point
at grid 4012-8883.

272
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,021
Three Niner Alpha,
acknowledged.

273
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:14,986
RV Quebec Quebec 4012-8883.
Over.

274
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:24,996
Zero, this is Three Niner Alpha.
66 coming home. Over.

275
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,998
Zero, acknowledged.

276
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,168
Fuck!

277
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,437
(soulful music)

278
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,157
(man): KAF.

279
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,202
You might as well be
on Mars as in Afghanistan.

280
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,079
We're out in the middle
of the desert,

281
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,040
surrounded by a force
of razor wire.

282
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,501
It's a coalition force
from over 45 different nations.

283
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,545
Two thirds of the soldiers
deployed here

284
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,088
never even see the country.

285
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,925
They just see blast walls,
DFACs, Tim Hortons.

286
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,511
Nobody even knows how many
people are on this base.

287
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:26,349
35, 45, 60,000?

288
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,725
It's here, inside the wire,

289
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,436
that we organize everything
that goes on outside the wire.

290
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,563
Half the time, we got it wrong,

291
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,815
but that means half the time,
we got it right.

292
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,319
It's a vast organism
that consumes

293
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,864
14 metric tons of food a day
and shits into a lake

294
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,700
that fills the air
with 30% fecal matter.

295
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:50,081
In KAF,
you breathe your own shit.

296
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,002
I'm building a road,
gentlemen.

297
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,089
I'm building a big fucking road
and it's going like a dagger

298
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:01,217
into the heart of the enemy
and it is fucking him up.

299
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,511
Every morning he wakes up,
I'm standing there

300
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,763
and I'm punching him
in his fucking face.

301
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:10,017
Now, we've never been this deep
into the Horn of Panjwai,

302
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,562
but Hyena Road is in there
and she's in there to stay.

303
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,439
And they don't like it,
'cause we're fucking

304
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,525
with their freedom of movement.
So they're going after

305
00:21:17,651 --> 00:21:19,944
our dump trucks and our
gravel trucks and our workers.

306
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:22,947
What are you saying?

307
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:25,366
I'm saying I've lost 36
civilians in the last 4 months

308
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:26,951
and this bullshit
has got to stop.

309
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,078
And I'm gonna need
a little help from you.

310
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:32,832
- General, I am just one man.
- You're Bashir Daoud Khan, BDK.

311
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,667
You're one man with a militia.

312
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:39,255
And I am your partner
in peace.

313
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,302
So I need your eyes and ears
and I need you and your son

314
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,053
to be at our little
dedication ceremony,

315
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,430
how many clicks, there, Shorty?

316
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,057
- 15, sir.
- 15 clicks of hardtop

317
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,475
into the Horn.

318
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,854
Your presence there
would be... very meaningful.

319
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,608
(foreign language)

320
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:07,325
Hyena Road is a gift
to all Afghans.

321
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:10,494
It would be an honour
for my father and I

322
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,912
to attend your ceremony.

323
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,333
Out-fucking-standing.

324
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,171
- Thank you, general.
- Thank you, sir.

325
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,937
Look at the little prick.
He's like Caligula.

326
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,982
It'd be a fuck of a lot easier
to get Hyena built

327
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,650
if that prick
would stop breathing.

328
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:44,278
Right there, you're right.
I'm gonna hop a flight.

329
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:46,822
I wanna get to Sper,
run down a lead on an elder.

330
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,449
Tell Armstrong I'll call in
from the FOB.

331
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,618
You don't want
to hang out with me?

332
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:53,037
Oh, you know there is nothing
I'd rather do

333
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,663
but the future
of Western civilization

334
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,957
depends on my ass
getting out to Sper.

335
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,387
(rhythmic Arabic music)

336
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,768
(man): Alexander the Great
marched into this graveyard

337
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,395
about 2,500 years ago.

338
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:04,024
¦¥asy to march in,
hard to march out. His words.

339
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:06,277
He and his mother wrote
to each other all the time.

340
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,529
One day, he got a letter from
her saying,

341
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,699
"What the hell? You conquered most
of the known world in a day and a half,

342
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:14,326
what are you doing
bogged down in Afghanistan?"

343
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,454
He grabbed a bag
and shoveled it full of dirt

344
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,248
and had it sent back to Greece
with a message to his mother,

345
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:21,834
"Take this dirt and
dump it around the palace,

346
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,127
see what happens."

347
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,754
6-1, taking fire,
left, 10 o'clock.

348
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,214
300 metres, breaking right.

349
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,675
(indistinct radio communication)

350
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,057
(gunfire)

351
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,726
Clear to engage.

352
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:51,280
Target is neutralized.
Roger.

353
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,823
(man): So Alexander's mother

354
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,617
spread the dirt
all around the palace.

355
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:56,619
Later that night, a couple
of attendants showed up

356
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:58,037
to make sure she was alright.

357
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,372
One says, "Go ahead, after you."

358
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,124
And the other says,
"No, after you."

359
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,460
And the first one says,
"No, I insist."

360
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,213
And the second one says,
"Don't you tell me what to do."

361
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:08,881
They pull their swords
and go at it

362
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,841
till they kill each other.

363
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,426
Alexander's mother
watched all this

364
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:16,764
and wrote a note to him saying,
"Okay, okay, now I get it."

365
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,768
And he wrote back saying,
"Even the dirt is hostile."

366
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,396
In Afghanistan, dogs fight dogs,

367
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:28,067
birds fight birds, men kill men.

368
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,527
Fire!

369
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,782
(mixed chatter)

370
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,661
Oh, man, come on,
show me their picture.

371
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:47,878
- Mind if I join you?
- Not at all, Warrant. Please.

372
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,849
Hey, I got an update
from the engineer

373
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,434
on that stretch of Hyena
from yesterday.

374
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,770
They cleared 8 IEDs in all.

375
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,522
Something went wrong
with the last one.

376
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:10,317
The guy lost his leg above the knee.
They airlifted him to Landstuhl.

377
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:14,822
I think we need to talk.
Hey, uh...

378
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,199
Hi, Jen.
Sorry to interrupt here.

379
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,659
Ryan, I'm Pete Mitchell,

380
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,202
one of the effects guys
with Brigade.

381
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,122
I don't mean to wreck
your meal, but you mind

382
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,165
if I have a word with you?
Sure.

383
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,585
Catch up to you later.

384
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,886
I was in the TOC
where you guys

385
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,597
had that engagement
in Haji Baba.

386
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,224
You were fucking lucky.

387
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,895
You come all the way
out here to tell me that?

388
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,314
Nope.

389
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,026
No, I came out here because -
and I could be

390
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,194
way out of line here but... -
you know, manifestly,

391
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,238
you and Jen got
a little something going.

392
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,199
On behalf
of the entire battle group,

393
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,493
I'd just like to express
our collective fucking jealousy!

394
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,537
(laughing)

395
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,748
You got a girl?

396
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,834
Yeah. Woman of my dreams,
back home.

397
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,047
- Does she know what you do?
- My wife? No.

398
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,424
She thinks I work
inside the wire

399
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,469
and I'm gonna leave it that way.
Let her sleep easy at night.

400
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,932
Tell me something.

401
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,644
How much you do you know
about Pashtunwali?

402
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,272
Whatever's in the handbook,
you know.

403
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:33,734
It's a tribal code. It's old.
Oh yeah.

404
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,655
It's so old they look upon Islam
as a kind of recent add-on.

405
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:42,159
- What are those?
- They're dates.

406
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,536
They're local.
They help you shit.

407
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,330
(Ryan laughs)

408
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,710
The code has got
a bunch of, uh...

409
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,671
Well, they call them pillars.

410
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:55,923
And one of them is Panah,

411
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,592
which means... protection,
more or less. So when that elder

412
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:01,053
invited you into his home,
he gave you Panah:

413
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,097
no harm could come to you.

414
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,309
Uh... so I owe him, you mean?

415
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,770
Well, he did it for Allah,
didn't do it for you.

416
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,855
But you're still breathing,
so that'd be your call.

417
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,111
This elder...

418
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,697
He speak any English?

419
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,492
No. Just a couple words.

420
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,537
Any marks about him,
any scars?

421
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,915
- No, but he had weird eyes.
- Weird how?

422
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,626
His left eye was brown
and his right eye was deep blue.

423
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:34,920
Hmm.

424
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:39,258
So who is this guy?
Why do you...

425
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,802
Why did he give me this Panah?

426
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,721
That's what I wanna know.

427
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,182
I got a patrol going back
into the village in the morning.

428
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:49,017
I'd really like if you'd come
along with me,

429
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,019
help me ID the guy.

430
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:55,023
- Yeah, sure, I'll be there.
- 0900.

431
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,817
- Alright.
- Alright.

432
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,736
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Yeah.

433
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,492
(soft music)

434
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:41,069
(chatter in the distance)

435
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:44,573
(Jen): What are you thinking?
(Ryan): Hmm...

436
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,202
I'm thinking
about our hotel room in Cyprus.

437
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,795
Um...

438
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,382
Okay, I'm gonna say something,

439
00:30:02,926 --> 00:30:05,636
and I say it for both of us
and it's going to be shitty.

440
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,639
It's gotta be said.

441
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,477
- Fuck me.
- You know that I am

442
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:16,438
completely crazy about you,
and Cyprus was...

443
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,821
Cyprus was perfect.

444
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,491
We're perfect.

445
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:29,618
But we can't keep doing this,
we both know that.

446
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:33,622
If we get caught,
I'm gonna get cashiered.

447
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,958
This is my career.
It's mine too.

448
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,127
I know,
this is what I'm saying.

449
00:30:39,254 --> 00:30:41,129
When we... rotate home,
we'll see.

450
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,215
But right now, while we're here,
it's got to stop.

451
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,179
(Ryan sighs)
So this is it?

452
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,056
(sighs)

453
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,850
I think it has to be.

454
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,527
This is like
fucking Armageddon.

455
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,070
I know.

456
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,368
You know there's nothing
that I would rather do right now

457
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:14,371
than climb over there and
fraternize the shit out of you.

458
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,875
Hmm...

459
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,253
You can't dump me
in one sentence

460
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,338
then say something like that
in the next.

461
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:25,632
(sighs)

462
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,723
Ah...!

463
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,448
(soft Arabic music)

464
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,751
(orders in foreign language,
muffled)

465
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,890
(man): Now, when we get
to the grape fields, if you see wire,

466
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,017
you see metal, you see plastic,

467
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,561
newly turned dirt,
don't step on 'em.

468
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,813
You didn't drop it,
don't pick it up.

469
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,941
Try to stay
at least five body lengths

470
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,901
between the next man
in the patrol.

471
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,527
When we get in the village,

472
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,488
you're gonna see women
dressed in bags.

473
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:30,864
Please don't stare at them.

474
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,617
I know you've probably seen that
in Toronto or Paris,

475
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,869
but you haven't seen it here.

476
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:37,829
Here, those bags are like
magnets for your eyes.

477
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,958
If you get caught staring at
them, it'll fuck shit up for us.

478
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,381
Quick clot, tourniquet, bandage.

479
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,257
I don't know how to use
any of that.

480
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,345
Ma'am, if it has to be used,
it won't be you using it.

481
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,932
(rhythmic music)

482
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,308
(indistinct chatter)

483
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:41,852
(Arabic)

484
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,982
(man): Hey! Eyes!

485
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,864
(Arabic)

486
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,286
In my job,
it is a great honour

487
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,704
to meet elders such as yourself.

488
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,831
Today, I meet you,
so it's a good day.

489
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,667
But I was hoping to meet
another elder in this village.

490
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,837
(translating)

491
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,427
(foreign language)

492
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:22,559
He says that, "I'm the only
elder, and there is no other."

493
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:25,604
Strange. Someone told me
there was another important man

494
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,773
that lived in this village,
but I forget his name.

495
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,941
But this person said you
couldn't forget him

496
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,902
because he had two different
coloured eyes.

497
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,406
(translating)

498
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:47,918
(shouting)

499
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:50,337
Hey, hey, hey!
What's in your head?

500
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:51,630
You're too high.

501
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:53,465
You can see the women
without their bags.

502
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:56,259
Get down! Get down!
Sorry, sir.

503
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,969
I think you know who I mean.

504
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,638
(foreign language)

505
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,056
He says he's a ghost.

506
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,808
Even ghosts
have to live somewhere.

507
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:06,269
(translating)

508
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,523
(foreign language)

509
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,529
He says most of them
live in Kandahar City.

510
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,502
(coughing)

511
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,464
Haji, what the fuck
are you doing?

512
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,050
The carpets, they are dusty!

513
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,846
The entire country is dusty.
(Cleaner laughing)

514
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,849
Come on, let's have some tea.
Step into my office.

515
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,852
How are you doing, Pete?
How's your family?

516
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,688
How's your time?
It's good.

517
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,772
And how's yours?

518
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,608
You heard from Kabul?
When will you see 'em?

519
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:55,443
Soon.
(Arabic)

520
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,945
(Pete clears throat)

521
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,947
You're frowning.

522
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,741
(Cleaner sighing)
I thought you were crazy,

523
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,411
but I was wrong,
and I don't like to be wrong.

524
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,288
My cousin says maybe he is here.

525
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:08,331
- In K-City?
- He thinks so.

526
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:09,958
Why is he back?

527
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:14,004
- If it's even him.
- But the eyes!

528
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:19,134
If it is him, do you think you
can get me to see him?

529
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,636
My uncle has arranged it
for tomorrow.

530
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,598
Tell them I'm gonna
bring along another guy,

531
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,516
the master sniper
with the battle group.

532
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:28,226
One other thing.
It's not relational.

533
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,687
- Related.
- Related, yes.

534
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,148
I'm hearing something
about an attack.

535
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,357
- In K-City?
- Soon.

536
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,109
That's all I know.
As soon as I

537
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,736
find out more, I will tell you.

538
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,196
Okay.

539
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,741
How are you?
Do you need anything?

540
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,159
No, I'm good.

541
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,827
You always say you're good.

542
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,871
I'm Afghan!
(foreign language)

543
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,706
(laughing)

544
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,958
Oh, listen, I got you...

545
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:55,795
I got you some of that shampoo,

546
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:59,799
some of that... hand cream
you guys are so crazy about.

547
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:02,010
(laughing)

548
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:06,014
- Thank you. This is great.
- You're welcome, my friend.

549
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:08,516
It's my favourite.

550
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,768
(laughing)

551
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,896
Guys, listen up, this is
straight from the brass.

552
00:37:13,022 --> 00:37:14,439
Guys! Listen! Alright.

553
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,027
No more fraternizing with goats,
you bunch of goat fuckers!

554
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,403
(knocking on door)
Okay, listen up.

555
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,780
All four DETs are out tonight,

556
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,115
all ops are observe and report,
except for you, Travis.

557
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,909
You guys are on that bend
in Hyena

558
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,203
where that fucking tree is,
so keep your eyes peeled.

559
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,539
I've been seconded to intel
for the day,

560
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,458
so I'm heading into K-City.

561
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:35,752
Wilf here is going to step up.

562
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,380
(applause, cheering)

563
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,050
Alright. I got some bad news.

564
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,052
They grabbed a couple of guys

565
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,804
from 10th Mountain Dog Company.

566
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,138
- What?
- Yeah.

567
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,642
I don't know the details, but
there was an IED of some sort

568
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,644
and the Talis grabbed
two of them.

569
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,647
Are they alive?

570
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,274
Yeah.

571
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,736
(long hiss)

572
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,280
Fuck!
(clattering)

573
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,410
You can blow me up
with an IED...

574
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:13,123
shoot me with an AK,
fucking run me over with a LAV!

575
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,794
I'm... I'm fucking fine
with that.

576
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,588
But do not let me get
taken alive by these...

577
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,966
fucking medievalists.

578
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,386
You good?

579
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,807
What exactly
do they do to you?

580
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,184
- It's unspeakable.
- New comm logs!

581
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,478
Fill them out.
What do you mean?

582
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,523
Hey... Unspeakable means
we don't fucking speak about it.

583
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,332
(muffled gunshots)

584
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:04,591
(whispering): Targets down.
Let's back up.

585
00:39:15,644 --> 00:39:18,438
First time, well...
how do you feel?

586
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:19,731
Good.

587
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:22,734
- Ready to go?
- No, not quite.

588
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,486
I gotta take a shit.
What?! Why?

589
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:26,237
Why? I don't know.
Maybe because my...

590
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,573
long intestine's full of shit?
Give me the bag.

591
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,534
Thanks.

592
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,209
(Hickey sighs)
What a beautiful night.

593
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:44,172
You know, if they get this place
together, I'd come back.

594
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,716
Bring Joey camping.
Camping?

595
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,760
- Yeah.
- In Kandahar?

596
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,471
Why the fuck not?

597
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:57,394
Number 2's fully offloaded.
Good to go.

598
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,815
Three Niner Alpha.

599
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,610
This is 66 Bravo ready
for extraction. Over.

600
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,405
Let's go, Wilf.

601
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:30,135
- It's a beautiful morning.
- Yeah, it's been for two hours.

602
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:31,845
How long until the convoy?

603
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,389
Should be on the move,
five to ten Mikes maybe.

604
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:38,601
These A&A dudes,
you trust these guys?

605
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,521
With my life.

606
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,731
It's their war.
We're just along for the ride.

607
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,817
(music playing from radio)
Hey, Walid.

608
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,694
Huh?

609
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,113
What's he got going
on the tunes?

610
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,284
(laughing)
Leif Garrett.

611
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,326
- You're shitting me.
- Yeah.

612
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,162
Come on, put it out,
for all to hear!

613
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,627
? I never had no problems yeah ?

614
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,882
? Burnin' down
one night stands ?

615
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:14,053
? And everything around me
yeah ?

616
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:17,765
? Got to stop
to feelin' so low ?

617
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:22,645
? And I decided quickly
yes I did ?

618
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,649
? To disco down
and check out the show ?

619
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,861
? Yeah they was dancin'
and singin' ?

620
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,905
? And movin' to the groovin' ?

621
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:34,282
? And just when it hit me ?

622
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:36,784
? Somebody turned around
and shouted ?

623
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:40,246
? Play that funky music
white boy ?

624
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:44,834
? Play that funky music right ?

625
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,338
(indistinct radio communication)

626
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:54,344
Okay, convoy's on the move.
Mount up!

627
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,472
? Till you die till you die ?

628
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,767
(soulful Arabic music)

629
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:17,534
Golf Niner Whisky,
we're pulling in. Over.

630
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,370
Roger that,
Golf Niner Whisky. Join in.

631
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,003
(indistinct prayer,
foreign language)

632
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,678
(traffic sounds)

633
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,072
(barking)

634
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,993
(people chattering)

635
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,381
Take this right.

636
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,095
This is Golf Niner Whisky.
We're breaking off.

637
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,430
Thanks for the tow.

638
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:22,015
Pete, anywhere here.

639
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:35,236
(Ryan): Who is that guy?
(Pete): He's called the Cleaner.

640
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,323
He's the bravest man I've ever
known and my greatest ally.

641
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:40,617
He works for us
but can't be seen with us,

642
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,202
if you know what I mean.
His family's up in Kabul

643
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:45,705
and he hasn't seen them
or slept in the same bed

644
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:48,291
for more than three nights
running in the last two years.

645
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:50,376
Why's he doing it?

646
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:54,255
Love of country?
I honestly don't know.

647
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:57,592
Can't just be for the money
we pay him.

648
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,356
(foreign language)

649
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,461
(introductions
in foreign language)

650
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,429
(foreign language)

651
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,180
(Walid): He says his name
is Mohammed.

652
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,393
Yeah, of course it is.
This bread looks very good.

653
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,978
(Walid translates.)

654
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:33,563
(Pete sighing)

655
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:38,109
My friend Ryan,
we've been friends,

656
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,820
we've known each other
and loved each other

657
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,321
for many, many years.

658
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,824
And you helped my friend
in the village of Haji Baba.

659
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,368
(Walid translates.)

660
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:54,792
And I would like to repay you
for that kindness.

661
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,544
You must need something,

662
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:59,630
perhaps new prayer rugs
for your mosque.

663
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:02,675
I would like to help with that.
(Walid translates.)

664
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,266
- How much is that?
- I have no idea.

665
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,644
This is for your village.

666
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,063
(Walid translates.)

667
00:46:23,197 --> 00:46:25,782
(foreign language)

668
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,536
He says, "Only a fool
accepts a gift

669
00:46:30,662 --> 00:46:32,413
without knowing
what it's for."

670
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,790
(chuckling)

671
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:38,503
There is a legendary warrior,

672
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,546
a mujahideen in the Jihad
against the Soviets.

673
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,715
He was called
the Lion of the Desert.

674
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,009
(Walid translates.)

675
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:55,520
(foreign language)

676
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:58,022
He says
he's heard of this man.

677
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:02,360
The word is that he's back.
He's once again mujahid.

678
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,904
Have you heard anything
about these rumours?

679
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,198
(Walid translates.)

680
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:19,085
May I ask where you're from?

681
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,586
(Walid translates.)

682
00:47:22,256 --> 00:47:24,423
(foreign language)

683
00:47:26,385 --> 00:47:28,553
He says his village is called
Abdullah Jan.

684
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,346
Ah. So you're Pakistani.

685
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:32,181
(Walid translates.)

686
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,477
(foreign language)

687
00:47:44,486 --> 00:47:46,571
I have been Pakistani
for many years,

688
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,407
a Muslim for 1,400
and a Pashtun for 5,000.

689
00:47:50,576 --> 00:47:53,327
I understand.
(Walid translates.)

690
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,082
If you hear anything
about the Lion...

691
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,126
I would greatly appreciate it.

692
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,879
(Walid translates.)

693
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:12,597
(foreign language)

694
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:19,604
So he's Pakistani?

695
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,772
No.

696
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:24,650
No, that was just
a kind of test.

697
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,778
Abdullah Jan is just the ruins
of some village

698
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,906
across the border
from Spin Boldak.

699
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,324
Nobody's really lived there

700
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,619
for a couple hundred years,
least of all him.

701
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,121
So he's not just some guy
from a village.

702
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,873
No, he's not.

703
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,044
He's the Lion of the Desert.
That's what his people call him.

704
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,927
But the Russians,
they called him the Ghost

705
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:52,845
'cause they couldn't kill him.

706
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,432
They shot him four times,
they blew him up twice.

707
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:00,853
And each time, his guys would
get him up over the mountains

708
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,272
and into the Red Cross tents
in Pakistan.

709
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,566
And they'd get him stitched up

710
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,778
and he'd be back out there
blowing Russians out of the sky.

711
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,284
We just met a very big gun,

712
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,620
like a Rommel or a Patton.

713
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:21,248
This guy beat the Red Army
and he was a kid when he did it.

714
00:49:23,168 --> 00:49:26,837
When the Russians pulled out,
he cut a deal with the Talibans,

715
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:30,007
"I'm going back to my grape
fields, I don't want any part

716
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:32,760
of your stupid civil war.
Just leave me alone."

717
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:36,097
Which they did,
which was kind of weird,

718
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:37,473
'cause generally speaking,

719
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:39,850
the Talis went after anybody
who stood against them.

720
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,603
But him, for some reason,
they just left him alone.

721
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:47,483
- (Ryan): But now he's back.
- He's back,

722
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:49,527
and I gotta figure out why.
A guy like him,

723
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,861
with his influence,
he could prob--

724
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:54,699
(explosion)
(deafening noise)

725
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,120
(people shouting, crying)

726
00:50:05,919 --> 00:50:09,046
(men moaning)

727
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,632
We got multiple bombers,
vehicle-borne and coordinated.

728
00:50:11,758 --> 00:50:12,758
Reporting civilian casualties,

729
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,719
multiple civ KIA, city centre...

730
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,804
Got a VBIED
southwest Kandahar City.

731
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,389
Multiple casualties.

732
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:21,767
A&A reports taking fire,
I-route 1 and Alpha 7-5.

733
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,185
(grunting)

734
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,895
Must have hit
the engine block.

735
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:28,315
- Goddamnit.
- Peter, where's the convoy?

736
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,860
- We lost the convoy.
- Alright...

737
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:34,739
(coughing)
Zero, Golf Niner Whisky, uh...

738
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,532
I have contact. Over.
Zero, acknowledged.

739
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,492
Yeah, Golf Niner Whisky,
we have contact

740
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:42,705
at grid Quebec Romeo 232-129.
We have no mil casualties.

741
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:44,749
I have mobility kill. Over.

742
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,792
Zero, roger. Be advised
we have reports

743
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,252
of multiple SBVIED in vicinity

744
00:50:48,378 --> 00:50:50,129
of police headquarters.
More to follow.

745
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,797
- Golf Niner Whisky, send.
- Yeah, it looks like

746
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:54,383
the Talis are at it again.
It's a shit storm out there.

747
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,010
I advise you try and exit city,

748
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,137
move to Camp Nathan Smith,
ride this one out.

749
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,930
Golf Niner Whisky.
Wilco. Out.

750
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,640
(Ryan): There's another
explosion! Let's go!

751
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,517
We're gonna have to move.
Heading north.

752
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:06,395
Goddamnit, can't get the radio.

753
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,064
Forget the radio,
we'll use my MBITR.

754
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,900
Let's go! We gotta move!

755
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,285
- I'm gonna have to blow it.
- Walid?

756
00:51:21,411 --> 00:51:23,996
- Yeah.
- Come! Behind the car.

757
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,210
Frag out!

758
00:51:33,632 --> 00:51:35,800
(siren blaring)

759
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:38,385
Mitchell, grab Walid.
Punch up to that corner.

760
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,721
Cover my 6.
Roger. Stay with me.

761
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:45,267
Clear.

762
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,813
(boy whistling)
Dick.

763
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,110
Let's go.
(distant shouting)

764
00:51:56,988 --> 00:51:59,365
(Pete): They're moving
on the fucking rooftops.

765
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,367
(panting)

766
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,455
Clear, let's go.

767
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,333
(shot fired)

768
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,336
RPG!
(explosion)

769
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:17,007
(panting)
You good?

770
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,968
Yeah, good.

771
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,887
(foreign language)
(gunfire)

772
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:25,015
- Can you shoot?
- Me? Fuck no, I'm intel.

773
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,896
Zero, Golf Niner Whisky.
I have PID on multiple hostiles,

774
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:33,774
40 metres east of last position.
Engaging. Wait out.

775
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:34,859
Zero, roger.

776
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,820
- Moving!
- Covering.

777
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,075
(distant shouting)

778
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,040
Tali at one o'clock!
(gunfire)

779
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,841
- Ah!
- Target down!

780
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:00,926
Mitchell, come up to me!

781
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,220
Move it, go, go, go!
(panting)

782
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,597
(insurgent moaning)

783
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:08,684
Hold up.
(panting)

784
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:10,311
I need you to punch left,

785
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:12,479
down that alleyway.
I'll cover you.

786
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,315
You good?
Yeah, good to go.

787
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,359
Standby.
(Walid panting)

788
00:53:18,403 --> 00:53:20,279
Go!
(gunfire)

789
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,291
Clear.

790
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,252
Clear.

791
00:53:38,423 --> 00:53:39,715
This is bad.
(panting)

792
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:42,176
You piss
with the dick you got.

793
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:44,220
Moving.

794
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,434
(insurgents shouting
in foreign language)

795
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:56,106
- Changing mags, cover me.
- Alright.

796
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,653
Moving.

797
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,743
Rooftop, 9 o'clock!
(gunfire)

798
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,676
Clear.
(chickens cackling)

799
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,027
- Shoot him.
- I don't shoot kids.

800
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,910
(foreign language)

801
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,583
Clear.
Clear.

802
00:55:00,255 --> 00:55:03,090
(honking)

803
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,550
Bomber! Ah!
(pan clanging)

804
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,385
It's my guy, it's my guy,
it's the Cleaner!

805
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:08,637
Go, go, go, go!
(tires screeching)

806
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:16,312
(gunfire)

807
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,945
Haji, where did you get
this truck?

808
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:26,488
My uncle!

809
00:55:26,614 --> 00:55:28,115
Of course!

810
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:30,200
I hung around,
you never know in this city!

811
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,787
I heard the gunfire, came
looking for you! We got lucky!

812
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,039
Fuck, yeah!

813
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,666
Zero, this is Golf Niner
Whisky, we're heading out.

814
00:55:37,792 --> 00:55:39,835
Zero, acknowledged.

815
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,670
Goddamn!

816
00:55:51,723 --> 00:55:53,223
(Pete laughing)

817
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:56,685
That was balls out, flat out,
fucking insanity!

818
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:59,980
Five suicide bombers,
a rack of RPGs,

819
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:03,984
17 dead and 37 wounded.
I gotta get a coffee.

820
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,944
Do we know
what they were after?

821
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,739
Yeah. Police headquarters.
We just got caught up in it.

822
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:11,367
That is Kandahar karma,
baby, that's what that is.

823
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,452
But I gotta say,
you handle your rifle

824
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:15,371
like you got ice in your veins.

825
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,872
Well, those Talis
were using AKs,

826
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,375
which is great weapons
if you're in a phone booth.

827
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,418
(Pete laughing)

828
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:24,254
You work the city a lot?
A fair bit, yeah.

829
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:27,424
- You got a weird job.
- Oh, yeah...

830
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:29,176
And you... and you don't?

831
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,637
Me? No!

832
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:35,099
No, everybody knows the rules.
You pick up an AK, an RPG,

833
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,810
you're gonna hear about it.
There's no gray area.

834
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,979
Well, except back home,
where they think what you do

835
00:56:41,106 --> 00:56:43,607
is a little too... I don't
know... premeditated.

836
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,485
But my shit? Hearts and Minds?
They lap that stuff up

837
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,278
'cause it's got
a moral ring to it,

838
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:49,780
even if it's mostly just PR.

839
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:51,740
You believe that?

840
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,035
These people here...

841
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,247
they got no use
for what we have on offer.

842
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:01,208
They don't want Justin Bieber
and Tom Jefferson

843
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,626
and our fucking pornography.

844
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:06,713
They just want our money
and a little bit of stability.

845
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,925
- So how do we win?
- There is no winning.

846
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:12,553
There's just an end state
and that's gonna get laid down

847
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:14,138
by foreign policy, not by us.

848
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,181
You're a cynical man.

849
00:57:17,725 --> 00:57:19,184
Not about this country,
I'm not.

850
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:21,061
Not about these people.

851
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,897
Me neither.
And I gotta believe

852
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:26,483
that if I put a $6 round,

853
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:29,153
just one bullet
in the right place,

854
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,988
I could change everything.

855
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:34,158
You may be right.

856
00:57:35,452 --> 00:57:38,996
- You gonna stick around Sper?
- No.

857
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:41,748
I'm gonna hop a flight.
Should grab my gear.

858
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:45,085
I'll be in touch.
I'll be around.

859
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:56,054
(dogs barking,
helicopter hovering)

860
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,522
Don't say anything, just listen.

861
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,733
I know our situation,
I know it doesn't make sense,

862
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:09,610
but you need to hear this
from me.

863
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,069
I love you.

864
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:13,822
Right down to the bone,
right down to the goddamned

865
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,365
fucking marrow.
You need to know that.

866
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,493
Ditto. All of it.

867
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,130
- Haji, what are you doing?
- Cleaning the chairs.

868
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:32,257
- It's not your job.
- Whose job is it?

869
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,383
Well, it's nobody's.

870
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,053
This is why you have
dirty chairs!

871
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,014
(sighing)
I need some tea. Come on.

872
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,642
Why would he even agree
to a meeting

873
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,185
if he has absolutely nothing
to say?

874
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,521
Maybe he just wants the
Coalition to know he's back.

875
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,607
Maybe, but for what?

876
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,069
We need to know
who's in that village.

877
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,695
Can you get
into the Tazkera Registry,

878
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,030
find out who lives there?

879
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,617
I have an uncle, he works
in the Governor's palace.

880
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,869
God, how many uncles
do you have?

881
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:03,247
Pff. Many.
(Pete laughs)

882
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,498
Tell me...

883
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:10,170
What do you think of my hair?
I've been using the shampoo.

884
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:13,507
It looks silky smooth
and very manageable.

885
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:15,884
- Ah! And my hands?
- Hmm...

886
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,428
Soft, like a baby's bum.

887
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:20,973
(laughter)

888
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,182
You're the best.

889
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,479
(Arabic music)

890
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,956
Hey there, Chewey,
I need a favour.

891
00:59:46,624 --> 00:59:48,834
I'm looking at a village
at this grid marker.

892
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,919
Any events in the last,
I don't know,

893
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:53,171
say the last six months?
Come on, Pete-

894
00:59:53,298 --> 00:59:56,258
- I know I should go through Armstrong,
but I don't know what I'm looking for.

895
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,052
I don't feel like doing a whole
work up just on a hunch.

896
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:01,888
- You want a visual, I assume.
- Anything with eyes, yeah.

897
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,390
I'll let you know.

898
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,852
Thank you.

899
01:00:32,587 --> 01:00:34,921
Anything useful?

900
01:00:35,048 --> 01:00:36,840
Maybe.

901
01:00:36,966 --> 01:00:38,884
What do I owe you?
I'll take your beer allotment

902
01:00:39,010 --> 01:00:41,637
at the end of the month.
I only get two, same as you.

903
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:44,640
- And I'll take them both.
- Alright, they're yours.

904
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,644
And you can clear all this
shit off. Thanks, Chewey.

905
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:53,732
Oh yeah, and, uh...
one of these days,

906
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,443
I'm gonna split up
a fire mission,

907
01:00:56,569 --> 01:00:58,195
turn my chair on the backside.

908
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:05,327
Okay...

909
01:01:08,581 --> 01:01:10,082
Hey, Haji,
what do you got for me?

910
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,918
Oh, it's bad.
It's Bashir's.

911
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:15,337
You're kidding me.
BDK owns that land?

912
01:01:15,463 --> 01:01:17,506
You're sure?
It's in the record.

913
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,676
Alright, listen, can you get
out to Sper tomorrow?

914
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:23,261
- Yes, no problem.
- When you're at the gate, if anyone asks,

915
01:01:23,388 --> 01:01:25,681
you're just a contractor,
you're working on a school,

916
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:28,433
or... I don't know, a fucking
kite factory or something.

917
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,893
(chuckling): Okay.

918
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:31,687
Take care, my friend.

919
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:44,366
Have you had any tenderness
in your breasts,

920
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,411
or nausea or just the spotting?
No, just the spotting.

921
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,329
I'm really managing my cycle.

922
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:52,791
I haven't had my period
in six months, but...

923
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:55,168
I don't know,
maybe I missed a pill or...

924
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,586
maybe I'm just being paranoid!

925
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,213
No...

926
01:01:58,339 --> 01:01:59,715
If we find something...

927
01:02:01,342 --> 01:02:04,302
what do we do? You know
I'm supposed to report it.

928
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:07,222
Well, I'm... asking you
not to. As a friend, okay?

929
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:11,435
Oh my...

930
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:26,950
Ugh...

931
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:29,578
Oh, my God.

932
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,751
(sighing)
Okay...

933
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,592
(soft music)

934
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,586
(muffled cocking)

935
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:40,106
- How's Joey?
- (Mary): He's good, you know.

936
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:41,733
Report card's off the charts.

937
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:44,319
But he misses the shit
out of you.

938
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:47,197
(laughing)
Oh, come on, honestly.

939
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:49,699
He really misses me?
Of course he misses you!

940
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:51,284
Fuck, I miss you.

941
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:52,661
(sighing)

942
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:56,915
- I miss you too, baby.
- How much do you miss me?

943
01:03:57,041 --> 01:03:59,167
Wide-open prairie miss you.

944
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:00,669
(Mary sighing)

945
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,548
What about these?
You miss them?

946
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:08,927
Oh, Jesus, you have no idea
how much I miss them.

947
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:12,681
Hang on...

948
01:04:35,496 --> 01:04:37,330
I had to go back because
this op

949
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:39,958
was pretty early in the roto.
But yeah, the DETs observed

950
01:04:40,084 --> 01:04:42,252
between 15 and 20 Talis
moving across the field.

951
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,754
Because of the force size,
they didn't engage.

952
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:46,464
Company command requested
the grid.

953
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:48,675
They called it in, artillery
beat the shit out of them.

954
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:50,719
There was some fast air
in there as well, right?

955
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:52,178
Yeah, I believe so.
Two A10s.

956
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,515
- And they destroyed the field?
- That's what Warthogs do.

957
01:04:55,641 --> 01:04:58,768
Well, see, this matters
because, as it turns out,

958
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:01,730
the field is owned
by Bashir Daoud Khan.

959
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,148
BDK?

960
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,776
See, BDK leases the field to
the farmer, who's basically...

961
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:09,237
He's like a slave, right?

962
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:10,530
The farmer works the field,

963
01:05:10,656 --> 01:05:12,616
then at the end
of the poppy season,

964
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,618
he's gotta hand over 5,000 USD.

965
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:17,203
Whatever he gets
on top of that, he gets to keep,

966
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,622
which is probably like
800 bucks,

967
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:19,956
somewhere around
the national average.

968
01:05:20,082 --> 01:05:21,833
Now in this particular case,

969
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,461
the Talis go running around
the field,

970
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:27,339
ISAF blows the shit out of it

971
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:29,591
and the crop is ruined.
And now, well, the farmer,

972
01:05:29,717 --> 01:05:31,468
he's got less than Adam
before the apple.

973
01:05:31,594 --> 01:05:34,763
Well, BDK shows up and goes,
"Hello, where's my 5,000 USD?"

974
01:05:34,889 --> 01:05:37,557
And the farmer says, "Well...
the crop was ruined, you know?

975
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:39,225
No fault of my own."

976
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:43,021
BDK says, "I don't give a shit,
I'm evil. I will have my $5,000.

977
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,732
And you have X amount
of time to come up with it."

978
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,193
Wow, this guy sounds like
Tony Soprano.

979
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:50,946
Yeah, but without
the therapist.

980
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:52,864
We Afghans,
we're not very big on therapy.

981
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:56,451
(laughing)
Alright, so why are we looking

982
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,620
at this farmer?
His name is Abdul Malik.

983
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:02,374
His father's name is Haji Malik,
Lion of the Desert.

984
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:06,586
His father is the Ghost?
Holy shit!

985
01:06:06,712 --> 01:06:08,672
We think this is why
the Ghost has returned,

986
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,340
to protect
the honour of his family.

987
01:06:10,466 --> 01:06:12,342
There's some bad history
between BDK and the Ghost.

988
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:14,970
I don't want things to go
haywire 'cause I want the Ghost,

989
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:18,056
I want him to work with us,
'cause he can be a powerful ally

990
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:20,016
for what we're trying
to achieve down here,

991
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,643
maybe we'll actually
get Hyena built.

992
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:23,353
So where do I fit in?

993
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:25,772
Well, we think the date
for payment is close, yeah?

994
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,692
Two-three days kinda thing.
So I need eyes on that village,

995
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:30,902
I need to know
about the comings and goings,

996
01:06:31,028 --> 01:06:33,238
the who, the what,
all that kind of thing.

997
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,616
I got my snipers spread
all over the area of operation,

998
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,868
but I can redeploy,
rotate the DETs,

999
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:41,871
two days on, two days off
sort of thing, starting tonight.

1000
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:43,832
Outstanding!

1001
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:49,379
- You ever try a date?
- No, thank you.

1002
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:51,715
? Baby please don't go ?

1003
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,258
? Oh oh oh ?

1004
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:55,051
? Baby please don't go ?

1005
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:57,762
? Oh oh oh ?

1006
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:59,889
? You got dimples in your jaw ?

1007
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:01,433
? Oh oh oh ?

1008
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:03,518
? You got dimples in your jaw ?

1009
01:07:03,644 --> 01:07:05,145
? Oh oh oh ?

1010
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,564
? You got dimples in your jaw ?

1011
01:07:07,690 --> 01:07:11,484
? And that ain't all
baby please don't go ?

1012
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:12,902
- Comm check.
- Check.

1013
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:14,529
Right.

1014
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,114
Comm check to Wilf.

1015
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,615
Check! Roger you.

1016
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,617
- AKA training magnet?
- Check.

1017
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,162
(music continuing,
indistinct chatter)

1018
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,831
- AKA I smell a shit.
- Check.

1019
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,666
(indistinct chatter)

1020
01:07:26,792 --> 01:07:28,001
AKA douchebag.

1021
01:07:29,253 --> 01:07:31,087
? Hey hey little girl ?

1022
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,881
? Hey little girl ?

1023
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,632
? Hey hey little girl ?

1024
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,092
? Hey little girl ?

1025
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,720
? Ooh ?

1026
01:07:38,846 --> 01:07:39,929
? Hey hey little girl ?

1027
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,140
? Hey hey little girl ?

1028
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,933
? Hey little girl ?

1029
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,061
? Hey hey little girl ?

1030
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,771
? Hey little girl ?

1031
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:49,773
? Baby please don't go ?

1032
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:51,399
? Don't go baby ?

1033
01:07:51,525 --> 01:07:53,485
(music continuing)

1034
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:17,383
? Baby please don't go
baby please don't go ?

1035
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:21,179
? Baby please don't go
baby please don't go ?

1036
01:08:21,305 --> 01:08:24,933
? Baby please don't go
baby please don't go... ?

1037
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:52,127
(foreign language)

1038
01:09:07,143 --> 01:09:10,728
Brr!
(girls laughing)

1039
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,441
(foreign language)

1040
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:26,744
You seen anything, Tank?

1041
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,289
- Negative.
- Alright, take a break.

1042
01:09:29,415 --> 01:09:30,999
Roger that.

1043
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,587
Hey, buds.

1044
01:09:39,675 --> 01:09:41,092
Is there something
you wanna tell me?

1045
01:09:41,218 --> 01:09:43,178
(music from earphones)

1046
01:09:44,805 --> 01:09:48,016
Perry Como? In a combat zone?

1047
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,768
- It was on shuffle.
- Unacceptable.

1048
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:54,397
Completely inappropriate.

1049
01:10:08,996 --> 01:10:11,831
(soft Arabic music)

1050
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:23,927
You know,
I've been thinking about...

1051
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:27,013
what you said about changing
everything with one bullet.

1052
01:10:28,432 --> 01:10:30,516
You really believe that?

1053
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:34,187
(chuckling)
Yeah, I believe that.

1054
01:10:34,313 --> 01:10:36,105
I'm here, aren't I?

1055
01:10:36,232 --> 01:10:38,233
(chuckling)
Yeah, yeah.

1056
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,528
Look at this.

1057
01:10:46,325 --> 01:10:49,160
Okay, what the fuck is this?
(laughter)

1058
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,329
I'm a terrible dancer.

1059
01:10:51,455 --> 01:10:54,832
You're an unbelievably bad dancer.
(laughter)

1060
01:10:54,959 --> 01:10:57,377
But I'm a great shot,
and I've always been,

1061
01:10:57,503 --> 01:10:59,087
ever since I was a kid.

1062
01:10:59,213 --> 01:11:02,340
It might've been irresponsible
to put a weapon in my hand,

1063
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,716
but people would get
hunting licences,

1064
01:11:03,842 --> 01:11:05,134
they didn't even have a gun,

1065
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,262
just so that I could hunt
on their behalf.

1066
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,639
I used to shoot
hard-to-shoot game,

1067
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:12,350
put food on people's tables
when times were hard.

1068
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:15,103
Sir? Captain Bowman
wants to see you both.

1069
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,063
We're on.

1070
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:26,781
Three Niner Alpha,
this is 66 Bravo.

1071
01:11:26,907 --> 01:11:30,285
66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha
send, over.

1072
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,579
66 Bravo. We got a convoy
heading our way, over.

1073
01:11:33,706 --> 01:11:36,124
Three Niner Alpha,
describe the convoy.

1074
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:41,587
66 Bravo, three white
Suburbans coming in fast.

1075
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:43,464
Looks like they're up-armoured.
Over.

1076
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:45,758
Three Niner Alpha,
what's happening in the village?

1077
01:11:49,096 --> 01:11:51,389
66 Bravo, all is quiet, over.

1078
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:54,350
They're not ready,
they got no... Goddamn it!

1079
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:02,483
- Okay, what's going on here?
- I don't know yet.

1080
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,944
Get everyone up.
Roger.

1081
01:12:06,613 --> 01:12:11,034
Holy shit. 66 Bravo, we got
two VIPs exiting the vehicle.

1082
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,787
First 40s, black hair,
bad dye job, beady little eyes.

1083
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:17,165
Can he confirm VIP is BDK?

1084
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:21,044
66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha,
is VIP BDK? Can you confirm?

1085
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,712
66 Bravo confirming.

1086
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:26,049
VIP call sign Bravo Delta Kilo.

1087
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:28,551
Second civ Hamid Walid Khan,

1088
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,970
call sign Hotel Whisky Kilo.

1089
01:12:32,431 --> 01:12:35,767
Three Niner Alpha,
this is 66 Bravo.

1090
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,936
We've got Taliban,
counting four.

1091
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,230
He's got Talis with him?

1092
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,358
A guy like BDK plays
both sides of the fence.

1093
01:12:43,484 --> 01:12:45,568
66 Bravo, Three Niner Alpha,
do you have clearance?

1094
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:46,652
Are they carrying weapons?

1095
01:12:46,779 --> 01:12:48,071
Wednesdays-Fridays
he's with us,

1096
01:12:48,197 --> 01:12:49,739
Tuesdays-Thursdays,
he's with the Talis,

1097
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:52,075
and on days off,
they're both running narcotics.

1098
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,743
66 Bravo,

1099
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:56,746
negative, no weapons,
but they're in costume.

1100
01:12:56,872 --> 01:12:58,998
Black turbans, black man jams.

1101
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:02,460
These guys are not even trying
to hide who they are. Over.

1102
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,587
(chicken cackling)

1103
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:16,015
(girl screaming)

1104
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,686
(rhythmic music)

1105
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:25,274
66 Bravo, we have hostile action
against civilians.

1106
01:13:25,401 --> 01:13:27,735
Three Niner Alpha,
clarify "hostile action".

1107
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,571
They're taking kids.
Little girls.

1108
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:32,657
Three Niner Alpha, do you have
imminent threat, over?

1109
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:34,617
66 Bravo, negative,

1110
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:36,285
but they are grabbing
little girls

1111
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:38,037
and dragging them
to their trucks.

1112
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:40,498
(girl screaming)
(BDK shouting)

1113
01:13:40,624 --> 01:13:42,667
(man groaning)

1114
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:49,090
(foreign language)
(girl crying)

1115
01:13:49,216 --> 01:13:52,301
Authorized to engage? I am
getting ready to take the shot.

1116
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,053
No, I'm stepping in.

1117
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:58,808
66 Bravo, this is Golf Niner
Whisky. Sit tight, over.

1118
01:13:58,934 --> 01:13:59,934
The fuck?! Take them down!

1119
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:03,146
Unless they pull out weapons,
we can't get involved.

1120
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:06,649
- 66 Bravo, I can intervene.
- Golf Niner Whisky, negative.

1121
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:08,609
Unless you see a weapon,
do not intervene.

1122
01:14:08,735 --> 01:14:11,821
66 Bravo, they are taking
little kids.

1123
01:14:11,947 --> 01:14:13,990
Golf Niner Whisky, sit tight.

1124
01:14:14,116 --> 01:14:16,868
66 Bravo, clarify.
Are you fucking kidding me?

1125
01:14:16,994 --> 01:14:20,163
Golf Niner Whisky, unless you
see a weapon, do not engage.

1126
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,206
- We gotta do something!
- Your guys will stand down.

1127
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:25,460
- Jesus Christ!
- Settle down, Warrant! Fuck.

1128
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,884
F...uck.

1129
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:43,769
- You're out of line, here!
- Why didn't you override?

1130
01:14:43,896 --> 01:14:45,438
'Cause it's an intel op,
it's their call!

1131
01:14:45,564 --> 01:14:46,772
Rules of engagement.
You know that!

1132
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,775
- It's a fucking crime!
- We need to talk.

1133
01:14:49,902 --> 01:14:52,987
No, you know what?
We're good, we're good. Hey, Mitchell!

1134
01:14:53,113 --> 01:14:55,948
Mitchell, what are those girls,
like 8, 10 years old, huh?

1135
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:58,618
And we just stand there? What's
gonna happen to them, huh?

1136
01:14:58,744 --> 01:15:00,578
They're gonna be sold,
that's what's gonna happen.

1137
01:15:00,704 --> 01:15:02,538
BDK will hand them over
to the Talis,

1138
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:04,499
the Talis will put them
on the market.

1139
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,459
Whatever they get above
5, they're gonna keep,

1140
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:09,378
but BDK will get his $5,000.
And then I don't know,

1141
01:15:09,505 --> 01:15:10,630
they're gonna end up in...

1142
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:12,381
some shitty marriage
in Dubai, or worse,

1143
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:15,009
they're gonna end up sucking
dick in some brothel

1144
01:15:15,135 --> 01:15:16,302
outside of Fort McMurray.

1145
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,513
You know this
and we don't intervene?

1146
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,349
We didn't intervene because
we didn't have imminent threat.

1147
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:23,267
Those are the rules
of engagement!

1148
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:25,394
I had to make that call!

1149
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:27,605
We didn't intervene because
BDK is protected by a roof

1150
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:30,566
on top of which is a great
big fucking sign that reads CIA!

1151
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,277
He's their asset. Now, you wanna
bring down our general

1152
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:35,196
and fuck up
the entire battle group?

1153
01:15:35,322 --> 01:15:37,240
Be my guest, go ahead,
shoot him.

1154
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:39,325
What kind of fucking war
are we fighting here?!

1155
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:40,993
Oh, come on, it's not one war!

1156
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:42,662
It's a whole bunch
of different wars.

1157
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,539
And mine,
it's like a 3D chess game.

1158
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:46,207
Half the time, I don't even know

1159
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,833
who the fuck
I'm playing against.

1160
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,752
We're not playing games here!

1161
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,422
No, we're not.

1162
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:55,967
But we're not here
so kids can fly kites either.

1163
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:58,010
Then what the fuck
are we doing here?

1164
01:15:58,136 --> 01:15:59,554
We are rolling back the clock

1165
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,847
and we are stacking the deck
so this time,

1166
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,641
the complete fucking
crazies don't win.

1167
01:16:03,767 --> 01:16:06,561
Haji, did you get all of that?
Yes, the relay was clear.

1168
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:13,901
He's going to have to react.
He will make badal.

1169
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:18,447
Okay, badal is another
one of those tribal pillars.

1170
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,283
Come on, sit down.

1171
01:16:22,786 --> 01:16:24,120
Sit down.

1172
01:16:26,790 --> 01:16:29,875
Badal basically means, like...
revenge, or...

1173
01:16:30,002 --> 01:16:31,919
It's like an eye for an eye
kinda thing.

1174
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,087
It's more about honour.

1175
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:36,591
If the leader of the family
cannot restore honour to them,

1176
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:38,301
then he must leave, forever.

1177
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,261
So the Ghost has no choice.
He must act.

1178
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:41,304
Here's the thing.

1179
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,765
BDK served under the Ghost
in the war against the Russians.

1180
01:16:44,891 --> 01:16:47,101
Story goes that a Russian
chopper went down

1181
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:50,354
and BDK ass-raped one of the pilots.
And as punishment,

1182
01:16:50,480 --> 01:16:52,815
the Ghost embarrassed him
in front of the rest of the muj.

1183
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:56,611
- So you see, badal continues.
- BDK is a bad guy

1184
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:58,237
and he needs to be brought down.

1185
01:16:58,363 --> 01:17:01,032
Now we can't do it,
but the Ghost can. To do that,

1186
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,783
we gotta boost the stature
of the Ghost,

1187
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:04,535
and we're gonna start
by inviting the Ghost

1188
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:05,995
to the ceremony for Hyena Road.

1189
01:17:06,121 --> 01:17:08,039
Put them together.
Badal is possible.

1190
01:17:08,165 --> 01:17:10,708
I'm also gonna offer up
the safe house.

1191
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:12,877
If they meet on Hyena Road,

1192
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:15,921
it's political. If they meet
at the safe house, it's personal.

1193
01:17:16,048 --> 01:17:17,673
Either way,
there's gonna be fireworks.

1194
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:21,344
Okay, there's a flight heading back to KAF
in about 10-11 Mikes, I'm gonna hop on it.

1195
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,554
I need you to set up
a meeting with the Ghost,

1196
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,056
we'll do it at the safe house.

1197
01:17:25,182 --> 01:17:27,516
And I need your team
to scope out security

1198
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:29,894
at the ceremony site
and at the safe house.

1199
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,522
Ryan...

1200
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:35,232
Ryan...

1201
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:40,571
Don't think I don't feel
for those girls, 'cause I do.

1202
01:17:40,697 --> 01:17:43,366
And we'll do what we can
to find them.

1203
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:47,870
But right now, in the bigger
picture, we need the Ghost.

1204
01:18:02,552 --> 01:18:05,513
(chanting)
(buzzing sound)

1205
01:18:16,900 --> 01:18:19,694
(foreign language)

1206
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,928
(rhythmic Oriental music)

1207
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,807
(tires screeching)

1208
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:56,749
(foreign language)

1209
01:20:18,021 --> 01:20:19,814
(foreign language)

1210
01:20:28,031 --> 01:20:29,824
(knocking)

1211
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:35,913
Travis said
you were looking for me.

1212
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:38,082
Yeah...

1213
01:20:39,668 --> 01:20:42,002
Alright, look, I'm sorry,
I lost my shit.

1214
01:20:42,128 --> 01:20:43,796
(Ryan sighing)

1215
01:20:43,922 --> 01:20:46,590
But you know me. And
you know that most of the time,

1216
01:20:46,716 --> 01:20:48,259
I'm proud about what we do here

1217
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,719
and I'm proud about
how we go about doing it,

1218
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:52,555
but... those were kids.

1219
01:20:54,474 --> 01:20:56,976
If we can't help them, what's
the point of doing all this?

1220
01:20:57,102 --> 01:21:00,229
I don't... have an answer for
that, and for what it's worth,

1221
01:21:00,355 --> 01:21:02,439
I agree with you,
but that's not, um...

1222
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,483
what I wanted to see you about.

1223
01:21:06,570 --> 01:21:08,863
Uh, do you mind just...
closing the door?

1224
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,497
Uh...
(mumbling)

1225
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,709
Have a seat, I just have
to show you something.

1226
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,713
(Jennifer sighs)

1227
01:21:38,518 --> 01:21:39,894
What's this?

1228
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:43,314
Uh, that's our baby.

1229
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:47,318
It was... Cyprus, I guess.

1230
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,914
It's one of the most beautiful
things I've ever seen.

1231
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,920
(chuckling)
The most beautiful thing.

1232
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:11,008
This kind of changes things...
doesn't it?

1233
01:22:11,134 --> 01:22:12,217
Yeah, yeah,
it changes everything.

1234
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:14,553
I think that... you know,
in terms of the brass,

1235
01:22:14,679 --> 01:22:17,431
we're gonna be okay because it
happened while we were on leave,

1236
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:21,101
but we gotta figure out
what we're... gonna do.

1237
01:22:21,227 --> 01:22:24,146
Figure out
what we're gonna do?

1238
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:29,443
We're gonna have a baby.

1239
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,988
Is that what you want?

1240
01:22:36,576 --> 01:22:39,703
Yeah, of course it's what
I want, more than anything.

1241
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:42,915
(sighing)
Okay, good, I'm glad.

1242
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:45,250
You know,
you're making me crazy.

1243
01:22:45,377 --> 01:22:49,046
I know, I'm making myself crazy.
(laughter)

1244
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:52,841
- What did you think I'd think?
- I don't know, I just was...

1245
01:22:52,968 --> 01:22:55,177
I was nervous. We didn't...

1246
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,682
...leave things very well.
(sobbing)

1247
01:22:59,808 --> 01:23:01,976
Come here, come here,
come here. Hey...

1248
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:04,979
We're gonna have a baby.

1249
01:23:07,607 --> 01:23:09,066
(both moaning)

1250
01:23:09,192 --> 01:23:11,860
Oh! Oh!
You sure it's mine?

1251
01:23:11,987 --> 01:23:13,195
(laughter)

1252
01:23:29,629 --> 01:23:32,006
(man): Niner Niner Tac on base.

1253
01:23:39,222 --> 01:23:42,307
Cocks! Another IED hit
out on Hyena.

1254
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:46,186
One KIA. A guy out of Kabul,
father of how many, Shorty?

1255
01:23:46,312 --> 01:23:48,522
- Five, sir.
- Five. Fuck.

1256
01:23:48,648 --> 01:23:49,606
(sighing)

1257
01:23:49,733 --> 01:23:52,443
Finding these pricks is like
nailing Jell-O to the wall.

1258
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:56,822
I cannot keep losing civilians
if we're gonna get Hyena built.

1259
01:23:56,948 --> 01:23:59,742
And if we're gonna prevail
down there...

1260
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:01,368
Hyena's gotta go through.

1261
01:24:01,494 --> 01:24:02,995
(sighing)

1262
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,788
I gotta get out there,
on the ground,

1263
01:24:04,914 --> 01:24:06,165
gotta get my Leopard 2s rolling,

1264
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:08,083
and blow them fuckers
out of their beds.

1265
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,919
I gotta find
their weapons caches,

1266
01:24:11,046 --> 01:24:12,921
I gotta fuck with
their command and control

1267
01:24:13,048 --> 01:24:15,507
and I cannot do that bouncing
around in goddamn helicopters.

1268
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:17,634
That's a kinetic imperative,
Pete.

1269
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:20,220
I'm gonna need a little
help from you non-kinetic types.

1270
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:22,973
I need you effects guys going
there and work your magic.

1271
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:25,934
Understood, sir.
We are working on it.

1272
01:24:26,061 --> 01:24:28,771
My Afghan guys tell me that
BDK's behind all of this shit.

1273
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,230
The more the security situation
deteriorates,

1274
01:24:30,356 --> 01:24:32,858
the more money he's making out
of all the gravel trucks,

1275
01:24:32,984 --> 01:24:34,985
all the other stuff
he's into us for.

1276
01:24:35,111 --> 01:24:37,112
- Fucking horrible little man.
- If he was out of the picture,

1277
01:24:37,238 --> 01:24:40,365
getting Hyena through
would be a hell of a lot easier.

1278
01:24:40,492 --> 01:24:43,160
He gets knocked of his perch,
I would not weep.

1279
01:24:43,286 --> 01:24:45,370
Understood, sir.
(sighing)

1280
01:24:45,497 --> 01:24:46,413
I hear the Ghost's back.

1281
01:24:46,539 --> 01:24:48,373
- Yes, sir.
- See a threat?

1282
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:50,667
Just the opposite. I think
he could be a powerful ally.

1283
01:24:50,794 --> 01:24:52,252
I don't care how you do it,

1284
01:24:52,378 --> 01:24:54,421
just make sure my civilians
aren't getting hit

1285
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:56,924
every time they drive
a fucking truck down there.

1286
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:59,510
- Understood, sir.
- Thanks, Pete.

1287
01:25:05,308 --> 01:25:06,934
(sighing)

1288
01:25:09,312 --> 01:25:10,979
(sighing)

1289
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:13,398
Haji, what the fuck
are you doing?

1290
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:16,193
What? You can't see
out of these things!

1291
01:25:16,319 --> 01:25:17,653
There's nothing to see.

1292
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,197
No, not the way they are, no!

1293
01:25:20,323 --> 01:25:23,867
Okay... Get in touch with
the Ghost, the meeting's on.

1294
01:25:23,993 --> 01:25:25,119
You have approval?

1295
01:25:25,245 --> 01:25:28,539
It's always better to ask for
forgiveness than permission,

1296
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:29,832
you know that.

1297
01:25:29,958 --> 01:25:33,168
(Cleaner chuckles)
We'll meet him at the safe house.

1298
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,512
(Ryan): This house has
a key feature.

1299
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:27,681
It's our asset, a safe house.

1300
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:31,059
We'll set up our OP here, at the
summit of the saddle back ridge.

1301
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:34,605
That'll give us clear line of
sight to both sides of the hill:

1302
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:37,065
here, at the safe house,

1303
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:39,610
and here, where the ceremony's
gonna take place.

1304
01:26:39,736 --> 01:26:41,153
- What's the range?
- It's comfortable,

1305
01:26:41,279 --> 01:26:43,989
1, 150, 750 metres
both sides of the hill.

1306
01:26:44,115 --> 01:26:45,407
And what about extraction?

1307
01:26:45,533 --> 01:26:48,911
We'll exfil down the back
side, through the grape fields

1308
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:50,954
and get picked up
en route Hyena.

1309
01:26:51,080 --> 01:26:52,456
How's this house gonna play?

1310
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:55,334
That's unknown.

1311
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:58,712
There's an offer out
to the Ghost and BDK to show.

1312
01:26:58,838 --> 01:27:01,089
Intel thinks they'll show up
either at the safe house

1313
01:27:01,216 --> 01:27:02,299
or at the ceremony,

1314
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:04,927
so we need eyes on both.

1315
01:27:05,053 --> 01:27:08,847
This is a tricky op,
so I'll take lead.

1316
01:27:08,973 --> 01:27:11,433
Wilf, you'll stand this one
down.

1317
01:27:11,559 --> 01:27:14,061
Alright, let's gear up.

1318
01:27:16,189 --> 01:27:18,106
I would like to thank you
for meeting with me.

1319
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:20,108
(Walid translates)

1320
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:22,486
(foreign language)

1321
01:27:22,612 --> 01:27:24,488
He says, "The honour is mine."

1322
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,827
(foreign language)

1323
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:38,669
He says, "I'm surprised
to be here.

1324
01:27:38,795 --> 01:27:40,921
I used to come
to this house many times."

1325
01:27:41,047 --> 01:27:43,340
He's asking, "Do you know
who used to own this house?"

1326
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:44,925
Mullah Omar.

1327
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,681
(foreign language)

1328
01:27:53,309 --> 01:27:55,018
He saved his ears,
but he lost his eye.

1329
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:57,562
- What does that mean?
- Same same.

1330
01:27:57,689 --> 01:28:00,023
- Same same what?
- Same same, same same.

1331
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,820
If you ever need to use this
house for whatever reason,

1332
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:07,489
it's yours.
(Walid translates)

1333
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:12,286
There was an event in Panjaway
the other day,

1334
01:28:12,412 --> 01:28:13,996
the village of Haji Baba.

1335
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:17,249
Two little girls were taking
out of the arms or their father.

1336
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,918
(Walid translates)

1337
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,842
(foreign language)
He says, "Why have you come to me?"

1338
01:28:26,968 --> 01:28:30,512
Because the little girls were
taken by Bashir Daoud Khan.

1339
01:28:30,638 --> 01:28:32,264
(Walid translates)

1340
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:39,187
My general is
a compassionate man.

1341
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:41,815
He's a student of Pashtunwali.

1342
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:45,193
And he would like to help you,
to help all Afghans,

1343
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:47,529
to help the village
of Haji Baba.

1344
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:50,032
(Walid translates)

1345
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,159
(Velcro)

1346
01:28:52,952 --> 01:28:54,953
(unzipping)

1347
01:28:57,123 --> 01:29:00,542
And he would be very honoured
if you would accept this gift:

1348
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:03,420
5,000 US dollars.

1349
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:05,172
(Walid translates)

1350
01:29:06,758 --> 01:29:08,925
He will also be honoured
if you would attend

1351
01:29:09,052 --> 01:29:12,012
the ceremony for Hyena Road.

1352
01:29:12,138 --> 01:29:14,181
(Walid translates)

1353
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:19,770
(foreign language)

1354
01:29:22,190 --> 01:29:25,150
(Walid): He's saying, "Why me?
I'm a simple grape farmer."

1355
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:27,694
He understands this,
but your presence would do him

1356
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,405
a great honour
as an elder of the region.

1357
01:29:30,531 --> 01:29:33,700
(Walid translates)

1358
01:29:34,786 --> 01:29:37,371
(foreign language)
"Who else will be there?"

1359
01:29:39,374 --> 01:29:41,041
Bashir Daoud Khan.

1360
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:51,968
(foreign language)

1361
01:29:54,806 --> 01:29:57,599
(Walid): "I have known this man
Bashir since he was a boy."

1362
01:29:57,725 --> 01:29:59,601
(foreign language)

1363
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,071
"He brought great dishonour
to our cause,

1364
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:13,448
and he was punished
by my own hands."

1365
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:15,700
(foreign language)

1366
01:30:28,840 --> 01:30:31,508
"Thank your general
for his kindness,

1367
01:30:31,634 --> 01:30:34,428
and it will be my honour
to attend."

1368
01:30:37,765 --> 01:30:39,850
(chicken cackling)

1369
01:30:41,060 --> 01:30:43,437
(foreign language)

1370
01:30:43,563 --> 01:30:46,231
(Walid): He says,
"The chicken hates you."

1371
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:52,737
Yeah, Haji, it's me.

1372
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:54,030
Yeah...

1373
01:30:54,157 --> 01:30:56,074
I'm watching him walk up
the side of a mountain.

1374
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:57,534
Yeah, he says
he's gonna show up,

1375
01:30:57,660 --> 01:30:59,870
but I got the feeling he's got
something up his sleeve,

1376
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,706
so I'm gonna need you to get
your eyes and ears out there,

1377
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:04,166
see what you can learn, okay?

1378
01:31:04,292 --> 01:31:06,460
Yeah...
(foreign language)

1379
01:31:09,881 --> 01:31:11,882
Okay, let's get our gear,
we're going.

1380
01:31:24,687 --> 01:31:26,563
(farting)

1381
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:29,691
Whoa! Local meat?

1382
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:34,070
Heavenly Father...

1383
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:38,116
Please protect
those little girls.

1384
01:31:40,703 --> 01:31:43,121
Watch over them
and bring them home.

1385
01:31:53,925 --> 01:31:56,343
(rattling)
(gasping, laughing)

1386
01:31:58,346 --> 01:31:59,721
(both sighing)

1387
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,807
Hi...

1388
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:05,393
Hi, listen, I'm not sure I was
entirely clear about all this,

1389
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,354
so I want to spell it out.

1390
01:32:08,731 --> 01:32:10,941
I'd like it very much if, um...

1391
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:14,528
you'd marry me, Captain Bowman.

1392
01:32:16,155 --> 01:32:20,534
I would also like that very
much, Warrant Officer Sanders.

1393
01:32:30,169 --> 01:32:34,089
Okay, I gotta go. We're
heading out. I gotta kit up.

1394
01:32:34,215 --> 01:32:37,509
Oh, why don't I...
help you with that kit.

1395
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,179
(Bowman laughing)

1396
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:57,571
Oh... we're crazy.
(both laughing)

1397
01:32:58,573 --> 01:33:00,574
Fucking certifiable.

1398
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:05,787
Be careful.

1399
01:33:06,581 --> 01:33:08,415
I promise.

1400
01:33:14,005 --> 01:33:15,797
(Jen laughing)

1401
01:33:18,009 --> 01:33:20,010
You're driving me crazy!

1402
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,430
(Jen sighing)

1403
01:33:25,224 --> 01:33:27,892
My God...
(zipping)

1404
01:33:28,019 --> 01:33:29,811
Oh, fucking...

1405
01:33:52,627 --> 01:33:53,835
Hey, Jen.

1406
01:33:53,961 --> 01:33:56,463
Hey, hey. So how do you think
this is gonna play out?

1407
01:33:56,589 --> 01:33:58,256
Oh, hard to say,
a lot of variables.

1408
01:33:58,382 --> 01:34:00,467
If the plan holds, we're golden.

1409
01:34:00,593 --> 01:34:02,052
Anything shifts, who knows.

1410
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,845
We got Niner Niner Tac
en route, ma'am.

1411
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:05,930
Okay, buddy. Here we go,
general's on his way.

1412
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,974
You were down
at the ceremony site?

1413
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,310
Yeah, on my way here.
Usual motley crew.

1414
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:12,646
Goats everywhere, shit
all over the goddamn place.

1415
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:14,689
You know what I'd like to see?

1416
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:17,525
I'd like to see this country
host the Olympics,

1417
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,235
that would be awesome.

1418
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:22,364
66, Three Niner Alpha, sitrep.

1419
01:34:23,658 --> 01:34:25,742
Three Niner Alpha, 66,
good visual,

1420
01:34:25,868 --> 01:34:28,370
clear line of sight
both sides, over.

1421
01:34:28,496 --> 01:34:30,664
Three Niner Alpha, roger.

1422
01:34:40,257 --> 01:34:42,759
66, Niner Niner Tac in sight,
1 click out.

1423
01:34:42,885 --> 01:34:44,886
(man): I confirm Niner Niner Tac
in sight.

1424
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:49,099
(Rilmen): I bet you
not one VIP's gonna be there.

1425
01:34:49,225 --> 01:34:50,433
They're not gonna show.

1426
01:34:50,559 --> 01:34:53,978
Oh, I think they'll be there,
sir. It's important to them.

1427
01:34:54,105 --> 01:34:57,440
25 bucks says
they're a no show.

1428
01:34:57,566 --> 01:34:59,567
You're on, sir.
(laughing)

1429
01:34:59,694 --> 01:35:02,696
I love your enthusiasm,
Shorty. Fuck!

1430
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,872
Go, go, go, go!

1431
01:35:12,998 --> 01:35:14,124
Move your ass out!

1432
01:35:14,250 --> 01:35:16,292
- Come on gentlemen, let's go!
- Move!

1433
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:26,594
66, Niner Niner Tac
has landed, over.

1434
01:35:33,561 --> 01:35:36,563
You're gonna owe me 25 bucks.
You realize that, don't you?

1435
01:35:37,356 --> 01:35:39,065
I'm an optimist, sir.

1436
01:35:39,191 --> 01:35:41,234
You're a fucking idiot,
Shorty.

1437
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:43,153
Roger that, sir.

1438
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,665
Three Niner Alpha, 66,

1439
01:35:55,791 --> 01:35:58,418
I have convoy in sight
on approach road, over.

1440
01:35:58,544 --> 01:36:00,837
Three Niner Alpha, white SUVs?
Confirm.

1441
01:36:00,963 --> 01:36:04,883
66, confirming, three white
SUVs, up-armoured, over.

1442
01:36:12,641 --> 01:36:15,059
66, convoy has turned north
off approach road,

1443
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,936
heading in direction
of safe house, over.

1444
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:18,521
Three Niner Alpha,
acknowledged.

1445
01:36:18,647 --> 01:36:20,690
Okay, everybody, we're on.
BDK's going for it.

1446
01:36:20,816 --> 01:36:23,443
The Ghost and BDK will meet
at the safe house,

1447
01:36:23,569 --> 01:36:24,694
not at the ceremony site,

1448
01:36:24,820 --> 01:36:26,488
so this is probably gonna get
personal.

1449
01:36:26,614 --> 01:36:28,406
You got that relay for me
at ASIC?

1450
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:29,866
You're hooked up now, sir,
go ahead.

1451
01:36:29,992 --> 01:36:34,245
Ah, One One Zulu, this is
Golf Niner Whisky requesting

1452
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:38,249
cellphone trap at grid
Quebec Quebec 3669-8537, over.

1453
01:36:38,375 --> 01:36:40,126
Golf Niner Whisky,
this is One One Zulu.

1454
01:36:40,252 --> 01:36:42,086
You're in luck,
we got a high asset

1455
01:36:42,213 --> 01:36:46,966
sitting on top of your grid
marker. Running traps... now.

1456
01:37:00,105 --> 01:37:03,358
Three Niner Alpha, 66,
convoy has stopped, over.

1457
01:37:03,484 --> 01:37:05,318
Three Niner Alpha, roger.

1458
01:37:05,444 --> 01:37:07,904
Golf Niner Whisky,
One One Zulu. We have a trap.

1459
01:37:08,030 --> 01:37:09,697
Three signals.
You want them all up?

1460
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:11,449
One One Zulu,
Golf Niner Whisky, negative.

1461
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:14,244
Can you just feed them to us
one by one, over?

1462
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,328
What are you doing?

1463
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,038
He's turning their cellphones
into listening devices,

1464
01:37:17,164 --> 01:37:19,290
but don't ask me how,
I have no idea.

1465
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:20,959
(chuckling)

1466
01:37:21,085 --> 01:37:22,919
One One Zulu,
first trap coming at ya.

1467
01:37:23,045 --> 01:37:24,420
(beeping)

1468
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:27,799
(foreign language)

1469
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,677
One One Zulu,
Golf Niner Whisky, negative,

1470
01:37:30,803 --> 01:37:33,263
you can drop that trap, over.

1471
01:37:33,389 --> 01:37:36,599
One One Zulu, good copy.
Number two coming at ya.

1472
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:40,270
(foreign language)

1473
01:37:45,067 --> 01:37:46,234
Yeah.

1474
01:37:46,360 --> 01:37:49,737
One One Zulu, Golf Niner
Whisky, that's our guy,

1475
01:37:49,864 --> 01:37:52,574
call sign Bravo Delta Kilo,
that's BDK.

1476
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:54,909
Thanks for your help. Out.

1477
01:38:00,291 --> 01:38:02,292
(foreign language)

1478
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:08,381
Three Niner Alpha, 66,
front door is opening,

1479
01:38:08,507 --> 01:38:10,967
call sign Ghost is stepping out.

1480
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:14,178
Call sign Ghost is alone.

1481
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:17,974
He shouldn't be alone.
He should have guys with him.

1482
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,059
So what does that mean?

1483
01:38:23,105 --> 01:38:25,106
(foreign language)

1484
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,405
The Ghost says that Bashir
has insulted

1485
01:38:32,531 --> 01:38:33,781
the honour of his family.

1486
01:38:33,908 --> 01:38:37,410
For a young man, a former
student, this is a great sin.

1487
01:38:37,536 --> 01:38:39,537
(foreign language)

1488
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:45,168
Bashir says that his son Abdul
owed him 5,000 US dollars.

1489
01:38:46,837 --> 01:38:49,923
The Ghost says he has just
given him 5,000 US dollars.

1490
01:38:50,049 --> 01:38:53,009
(foreign language)
(Walid): Bashir thanks him

1491
01:38:53,135 --> 01:38:55,094
and says this will satisfy
the question of the money.

1492
01:38:55,220 --> 01:38:57,889
(foreign language)

1493
01:39:02,561 --> 01:39:03,895
The Ghost says yes,

1494
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:05,730
but the debt
is not yet resolved.

1495
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,232
He wants his grandchildren,
the little girls

1496
01:39:08,359 --> 01:39:10,818
that were taken.
He wants them returned.

1497
01:39:10,945 --> 01:39:12,946
(foreign language)

1498
01:39:16,575 --> 01:39:19,160
(Walid): Bashir says
this is impossible.

1499
01:39:19,286 --> 01:39:21,454
The girls are gone, and
the Ghost should know this.

1500
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:24,582
- This is so fucked up.
- Copy that.

1501
01:39:24,708 --> 01:39:25,875
(foreign language)

1502
01:39:30,297 --> 01:39:33,257
(Walid): Bashir says that
his son Hamid is missing.

1503
01:39:33,384 --> 01:39:35,927
"His son"? How the fuck
did I not have this intel?

1504
01:39:37,388 --> 01:39:38,846
(foreign language)

1505
01:39:43,602 --> 01:39:44,727
Alright, Bashir is angry.

1506
01:39:44,853 --> 01:39:47,230
He says he wants his son
returned to him.

1507
01:39:47,356 --> 01:39:49,816
He says that
he wants to see his son.

1508
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:56,072
(foreign language)

1509
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:59,409
The Ghost says,
"And so you shall."

1510
01:40:12,006 --> 01:40:13,339
(foreign language)

1511
01:40:13,465 --> 01:40:16,676
Jesus. Three Niner Alpha, 66,
I have a head,

1512
01:40:16,802 --> 01:40:18,928
a human fucking head
lying on the ground.

1513
01:40:19,054 --> 01:40:21,431
Fuck.
(creaking)

1514
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:25,518
(Ryan): It's the son,
call sign Hotel Whisky Kilo.

1515
01:40:25,644 --> 01:40:28,146
Shit, shit, shit,
BDK is gonna react.

1516
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:30,523
Okay, look,
they must not engage.

1517
01:40:30,649 --> 01:40:32,734
66, Three Niner Alpha,
what is BDK doing?

1518
01:40:32,860 --> 01:40:34,318
Do you have hostile intent?

1519
01:40:36,447 --> 01:40:38,239
(foreign language)

1520
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,075
(Travis): We got a weapon.

1521
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:43,536
66, call sign Bravo Delta Kilo
has a weapon.

1522
01:40:43,662 --> 01:40:46,039
Hostile intent towards civ
call sign Ghost.

1523
01:40:46,165 --> 01:40:48,875
Fucking light him up.
(clearing throat)

1524
01:40:49,001 --> 01:40:52,003
66, Golf Niner Whisky,
do not take that shot.

1525
01:40:52,129 --> 01:40:53,921
- He has clearance.
- I'm overriding.

1526
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:56,215
66, Gold Niner Whisky,
you don't understand.

1527
01:40:56,341 --> 01:40:58,509
66, I understand
imminent threat.

1528
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:01,220
- Hit him, for fuck's sakes.
- Am engaging. Wait out.

1529
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:03,347
Confirm. Up 23.

1530
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:04,891
Right 2.
Roger.

1531
01:41:05,017 --> 01:41:07,727
66, Golf Niner Whisky, Ryan,
please, do not take that shot!

1532
01:41:07,853 --> 01:41:10,063
He has intent.
He doesn't need your okay.

1533
01:41:10,189 --> 01:41:11,647
Standby.

1534
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:15,943
(Pete): Ryan,
please don't do this.

1535
01:41:16,070 --> 01:41:18,946
This is how badal works.
This is what the Ghost wants.

1536
01:41:19,073 --> 01:41:21,032
Send it.

1537
01:41:22,326 --> 01:41:23,618
(Pete): Ryan, please!

1538
01:41:24,953 --> 01:41:26,496
(gunshot)

1539
01:41:28,707 --> 01:41:29,916
(Travis): Good hit.

1540
01:41:30,709 --> 01:41:32,376
(puts down phone)

1541
01:41:34,546 --> 01:41:35,880
(foreign language)

1542
01:42:10,249 --> 01:42:12,500
Alright, guys, let's pack up.

1543
01:42:13,752 --> 01:42:15,837
(Shorty): General,
we have to go.

1544
01:42:15,963 --> 01:42:19,006
Niner Niner Tac,
this is Zero advising exfil.

1545
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:21,134
Niner Niner Tac on the move.

1546
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:30,434
Niner Niner Tac exfiling now,
all birds in escort.

1547
01:42:30,561 --> 01:42:31,561
66, Golf Niner Whisky.

1548
01:42:31,687 --> 01:42:33,771
You have any idea
what you just done?!

1549
01:42:33,897 --> 01:42:35,815
66, yeah, I think I do.

1550
01:42:35,941 --> 01:42:38,901
I had imminent threat towards
a civilian, I intervened.

1551
01:42:39,027 --> 01:42:40,403
Yeah, you did intervene, 66,

1552
01:42:40,529 --> 01:42:42,238
in something
you know nothing about!

1553
01:42:42,364 --> 01:42:43,447
Back off, Mitchell.

1554
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,241
66, Three Niner Alpha,
continue to rendezvous.

1555
01:42:45,367 --> 01:42:46,200
You just fucked up!

1556
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,161
You fight your war, Captain,
I'll fight mine.

1557
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:50,079
66, Golf Niner Whisky,
call sign Ghost was seeking

1558
01:42:50,205 --> 01:42:51,455
an honourable death,
and you just...

1559
01:42:51,582 --> 01:42:52,874
you took it away from him!

1560
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:54,959
- We saved his life.
- It wasn't yours to save!

1561
01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:57,378
Now, he's got nothing! You
understand that? He has nothing!

1562
01:42:57,504 --> 01:43:00,548
That's enough, Captain. This
is my CP. You will back off.

1563
01:43:00,674 --> 01:43:02,175
(throws phone)

1564
01:43:04,011 --> 01:43:05,636
Salaam Alaikum.

1565
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,725
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

1566
01:43:12,311 --> 01:43:13,978
Think he knows
we just saved his bacon?

1567
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:17,398
I think it might be
more complicated than that.

1568
01:43:18,483 --> 01:43:20,818
How? What can possibly--

1569
01:43:20,944 --> 01:43:22,904
- Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
- Down, down!

1570
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:24,071
(foreign language)
(gunfire)

1571
01:43:27,910 --> 01:43:29,327
Where the fuck
did they come from?

1572
01:43:29,453 --> 01:43:31,621
The guys from the safe house
must've called for backup.

1573
01:43:31,747 --> 01:43:33,497
I got five to ten
on the right!

1574
01:43:33,624 --> 01:43:35,208
Covering!

1575
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:37,251
Oh, Travis, fuck!

1576
01:43:37,377 --> 01:43:39,503
Hickey, strip the classifieds!

1577
01:43:39,630 --> 01:43:42,715
Three Niner Alpha, 66,
contact, multiple insurgents.

1578
01:43:42,841 --> 01:43:45,718
One times VSA,
vital signs absent.

1579
01:43:45,844 --> 01:43:47,303
(man): Troop's in contact.

1580
01:43:47,429 --> 01:43:49,055
(shouting)

1581
01:43:49,181 --> 01:43:51,682
We're taking effective fire
both flanks!

1582
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:54,393
Three Niner Alpha, roger.
How many insurgents, over?

1583
01:43:54,519 --> 01:43:57,230
Fuck...
(gunfire)

1584
01:43:57,356 --> 01:44:00,524
66, two zero
to three zero hostiles.

1585
01:44:00,651 --> 01:44:01,901
(Pete):
The fuck they come from?

1586
01:44:02,027 --> 01:44:03,361
How far away are the birds?

1587
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:05,029
They're at least 30 minutes
out. Moved back

1588
01:44:05,155 --> 01:44:07,490
to exfil Niner Niner Tac.
Shit. Okay, get on to the TOC,

1589
01:44:07,616 --> 01:44:09,242
get a QRF rolling
out of Massum Ghar.

1590
01:44:09,368 --> 01:44:11,869
They're trying to break
contact! Move in the grape hunt,

1591
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:13,579
we'll strong-point from there,
over!

1592
01:44:13,705 --> 01:44:16,249
Three Niner Alpha, roger.
We're pushing for air and QRF,

1593
01:44:16,375 --> 01:44:19,543
but you're gonna have
to hang in there.

1594
01:44:19,670 --> 01:44:21,337
- Covering!
- Covering! Changing mags!

1595
01:44:21,463 --> 01:44:26,008
66, be advised, we have a
civilian under our protection.

1596
01:44:28,053 --> 01:44:29,303
Call sign Ghost.

1597
01:44:29,429 --> 01:44:32,390
What the fuck?
(panting)

1598
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:35,601
- We gotta leave him.
- Never! Let's go!

1599
01:44:35,727 --> 01:44:37,603
Covering!

1600
01:44:37,729 --> 01:44:40,189

Go, go, go!

1601
01:44:42,734 --> 01:44:46,654
Covering!
(all shouting)

1602
01:44:47,281 --> 01:44:48,906
Covering!

1603
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:54,870
- Drop him, drop him.
- (both): Covering!

1604
01:44:54,997 --> 01:44:56,914
Go, go, go!

1605
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:01,919
(all shouting)

1606
01:45:03,505 --> 01:45:05,798
Take him!
(indistinct reply)

1607
01:45:05,924 --> 01:45:07,633
(panting)

1608
01:45:08,135 --> 01:45:09,343
Covering!

1609
01:45:15,434 --> 01:45:16,726

Changing mags!
Covering!

1611
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:22,815
Changing mags!

1612
01:45:22,941 --> 01:45:26,569
Take Hickey! Go!
Get to the door!

1613
01:45:29,323 --> 01:45:31,073
Go, go, go!

1614
01:45:35,454 --> 01:45:37,538

1615
01:45:38,415 --> 01:45:39,582
(gasping)

1616
01:45:40,500 --> 01:45:43,044
Come on! Go, go!
(all shouting)

1617
01:45:48,759 --> 01:45:50,259
Ah!

1618
01:45:56,850 --> 01:45:58,059
(foreign language)

1619
01:46:12,366 --> 01:46:14,825
(groaning)

1620
01:46:25,003 --> 01:46:27,421
(shouting in foreign language)

1621
01:46:36,056 --> 01:46:39,433
- Three Niner Alpha, this is 66.
- I'm sorry...

1622
01:46:39,559 --> 01:46:41,685
We're strong-pointing
from a grape hut.

1623
01:46:41,812 --> 01:46:44,480
We're running low on ammo.
We're being surrounded.

1624
01:46:44,606 --> 01:46:46,315
What's your QRF status?

1625
01:46:46,441 --> 01:46:49,110
Uh... Three Niner Alpha,
QRF is one five Mikes out,

1626
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:50,986
you gotta hang in there.

1627
01:46:51,113 --> 01:46:54,657
Don't let them take us,
Lord, please, Jesus, not alive,

1628
01:46:54,783 --> 01:46:57,034
they're gonna fucking skin us.
(panting)

1629
01:47:07,629 --> 01:47:09,046
Badal?

1630
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:17,054
We've got a UAV above them
now, ma'am.

1631
01:47:17,180 --> 01:47:18,764
- Okay, put it up.
- On screen.

1632
01:47:18,890 --> 01:47:22,768
(Pete): Oh, my God,
there's dozens of them.

1633
01:47:22,894 --> 01:47:25,855
66, Three Niner Alpha,
sitrep please.

1634

1641

I'm gonna be a father.

1655
01:48:35,717 --> 01:48:37,343
You understand?

1656
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:42,264
You understand
what I'm trying to say?

1657
01:48:42,390 --> 01:48:44,141

1658
01:48:49,523 --> 01:48:51,690

1668
01:50:53,063 --> 01:50:55,064
(distant chatter)

1669
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:11,288

1670
01:51:12,290 --> 01:51:13,666
Go! Go, go!

(indistinct chatter)

1672
01:51:17,295 --> 01:51:19,963

1673
01:51:20,090 --> 01:51:22,966

(foreign language)

1675
01:51:51,913 --> 01:51:54,415
(Pete): So who is it
that gave you this tip?

1676
01:51:54,541 --> 01:51:56,667
- (Cleaner): My uncle.
- Really?

1677
01:51:56,793 --> 01:51:59,420
Is every single adult male
in Afghanistan your uncle?

1678
01:51:59,546 --> 01:52:02,381
- Yes.
- Amazing.

1679
01:52:02,507 --> 01:52:04,383
I'm going to Kabul
for a while.

1680
01:52:04,509 --> 01:52:05,634
To see your family?

1681
01:52:05,760 --> 01:52:08,429
Kandahar is a bit crazy
right now.

1682
01:52:08,555 --> 01:52:09,972
Yeah. Be safe.

1683
01:52:10,098 --> 01:52:12,558
Call me when you're back.

1684
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:15,436
Fuck, I'm gonna be late.

1685
01:52:15,562 --> 01:52:17,604
This man Ryan,
he was your friend.

1686
01:52:19,566 --> 01:52:22,151
Yeah... Yeah, he was.

1687
01:52:22,944 --> 01:52:25,028
I don't have too many friends
here.

1688
01:52:25,155 --> 01:52:27,156
You have me. I'm your friend.

1689
01:52:27,282 --> 01:52:29,616
Yeah, you are.

1690
01:52:40,378 --> 01:52:43,172
(bagpipe playing)

1691
01:52:43,298 --> 01:52:45,591
(indistinct orders)

1692
01:53:14,204 --> 01:53:16,205
(man): Turn!

1693
01:53:18,792 --> 01:53:21,418
Prepare to lower...
Lower!

1694
01:53:31,221 --> 01:53:33,222
Recover!

1695
01:53:36,434 --> 01:53:38,227
Turn!

1696
01:54:19,477 --> 01:54:22,062
(Pete): Alexander the Great
fought a counter-insurgency

1697
01:54:22,188 --> 01:54:24,565
in Afghanistan that lasted
almost three years.

1698
01:54:24,691 --> 01:54:26,525
And by the end of those years,

1699
01:54:26,651 --> 01:54:28,569
he was drinking heavily
and completely paranoid.

1700
01:54:28,695 --> 01:54:30,362
One night, he got into a row

1701
01:54:30,488 --> 01:54:32,948
with a guy named Cleitus
the Black, a loyal friend.

1702
01:54:33,074 --> 01:54:35,075
Cleitus accused him
of certain things

1703
01:54:35,201 --> 01:54:37,953
and Alexander threw a spear
into his heart.

1704
01:54:38,079 --> 01:54:40,747
As he watched his friend die,
he lost his mind.

1705
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:43,417
Five years later,
Alexander was dead.

1706
01:54:47,505 --> 01:54:48,881
As the Afghans say:

1707
01:54:49,007 --> 01:54:51,758
you might have the clocks,

1708
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:53,886
but we've got the time.

1709
01:55:04,522 --> 01:55:07,107
(soft music)

1710
01:56:22,600 --> 01:56:25,185
(rhythmic music)

1711
01:58:42,532 --> 01:58:44,741
(soft music)
