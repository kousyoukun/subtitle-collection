1
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:58,999
Mylord, it's time, you have to leave.
They will have you arrested.

2
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:02,954
Bring me some candles,
i'm working late tonight.

3
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,118
But, mylord..
-And a glass of wine, as usual.

4
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,912
The world had no choice but to change...

5
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:20,237
.. but the revolution has become terror
and me myself will be taken with away.

6
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,838
The certainties make people blind
and mad.

7
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:30,711
They can tear their hearts apart
and make a beast of theirselves.

8
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,119
In the year 1764...

9
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,029
...the Beast appeared on our grounds
and made it his.

10
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,075
One year later it was known 
far beyond our region...

11
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,233
...and people began to think nobody
could ever defeat it.

12
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:20,037
By his attacks the Gevaudan sunk
deeper and deeper into the darkness.

13
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,393
Stop...

14
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,996
Who are you?

15
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,073
What did he do?

16
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,471
-He's a thief.

17
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,993
And she?

18
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,355
His daughter. A witch.

19
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,759
I healed their horses and they
refuse to pay.

20
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,354
Do not listen.
A word has no meaning here.

21
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,078
Are the horses healed?
-Yes.

22
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,673
Go on.

23
00:06:55,640 --> 00:07:00,350
Welcome in the land of the Beast.
And watch out for wolf-traps.

24
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,910
Knight Gregoire de Fronsac...

25
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,477
...en the man called Mani were
hunters nor soldiers.

26
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,358
As taxidermist of the king..

27
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,115
...the Knight in Paris the
reputation of a freeminded and

28
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,748
...intellectual person.
The one who was following him..

29
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,632
...as his shadow was a stranger
nobody knew of.

30
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,673
When evening fell...

31
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,957
...they offered theirselves to
the castle of marquis Apcher...

32
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,075
...who gave them shelter as long as their
mission in Gevaudan would last.

33
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:05,870
Our people are not afraid of an
ordinairy wolf. The Beast is different.

34
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,518
It flees from men like it knows
it has to..


35
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,915
but it spares women nor children.

36
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,634
Have you seen it?
-No.

37
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,479
How do you know it's an 
animal then?

38
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,592
Those who survived gave that
description.

39
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:25,199
It's much bigger then a wolf 
and it doesn't fear bullets.

40
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,392
I understand your scepticism.

41
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,758
I don't believe in monsters either...

42
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,270
...but i had a report made for
you..

43
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,194
...of the crimes of the Beast.

44
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,950
You can judge yourself.

45
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,271
Grandfather said you were 
fighting the English in Canada...

46
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,230
Yes. I went there to study
the animals and nature.

47
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,676
...but i came back hurt
and with the grade of captain.

48
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,714
I arranged a hospital for the
victims of the Beast.

49
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,996
In an old abbey.

50
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,999
A women from Lorciere.
She came back from a party

51
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,312
...when the Beast attacked her.
Help came. The Beast vanished...

52
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,870
...but it deformed her face...

53
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,116
Tell me, Knight,
how is Mr Buffon?

54
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,676
And how are things in Paris?

55
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,350
And The Innocent One? 
Read about it already?

56
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,715
It is kind of late for philosophy.
You're right. How about the theatre?

57
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,072
Do you know actrices?
What are they performing this winter?

58
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,913
Put it right there.
People say she is curtuous.

59
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,590
I'm not sure if it's true,
but they offered their charmes.

60
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,472
Tell me.

61
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,709
With this your curiousity will be
satisfied.

62
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,913
Mercurius of France.
We only have the Post of Avignon.

63
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,233
I will show you the sleeping room.

64
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,516
He is sleeping over here.
-Good.

65
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,312
Goodnight, Knight.

66
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,759
It's not Versailles, 
but the wine is good.

67
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,512
Fat as a pig...

68
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:24,312
Jackques has seen many wolves.
What attacked him, was not a wolf.

69
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,119
The snout was longer and 
the teeth were like knifes.

70
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:38,118
If it's not a wolf, what is it then?

71
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,357
A devil.
-Knight.

72
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,796
The Beast attacked a women in
Saint-Alban.

73
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,953
There.

74
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,351
Don't worry Knight, nobody is
here.

75
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,238
Stop.

76
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,831
What are they doing here?
Son of a whore.

77
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,513
Goodday, captain.

78
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,072
Sir Marquis.

79
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,033
I greet you. But be careful.

80
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,669
There are traps everywhere.

81
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,278
This is Gregoire de Fronsac,
of the garden of the King.

82
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
He wants to see the body of this
unlucky soul.

83
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:34,396
With your permission ofcourse.

84
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,273
You treated my men merciless

85
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,835
I did not know they were acting
in your command.

86
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,672
They were not.

87
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,230
You did good and I apoligize.

88
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,830
My soldiers are made for war,
not for hunting.

89
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,277
The intestines were emptied and now
there is poison in it.

90
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,716
What kind of gardener are you?

91
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,708
When the Beast is dead,
the king wants it examined...

92
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,874
...and save it in Paris.
I have to stuff it after the hunt.

93
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:18,390
Now I try getting familiar with it.

94
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,233
With such jaws the animal should
weigh 250 kilos.

95
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,156
This time I will catch it.
Before the first snow I will have it.

96
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,311
If everybody helps,
it can't escape.

97
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,988
Did you see it already?
-Once now.

98
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,232
In 13 months.
I shot it and hit it.

99
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,313
It collapsed but got up instantly again.

100
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,393
We lost it south of the Mouchet.


101
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,233
Did it look like this?

102
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,228
It had somesort of black bar...
with stings Do you understand?

103
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,480
Friends, let me introduce you 
the maker of the drawings.

104
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:15,279
Knight Gregoire de Fronsac...

105
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,592
...the man comes from Paris to..

106
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,159
catch the Beast.

107
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,630
His Eminence,
the bisshop of Mende.

108
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,234
His Eminence,
the duke of Moncan

109
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,755
His Eminence,
the count of Morangias...

110
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:34,119
..and Mrs. Count
and their son Jean-Francois...

111
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,839
...who has traveled a lot too...

112
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,278
Good, mylord.

113
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,111
Thank you, mylord.

114
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,150
Mylord Laffond, our intendant..

115
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,711
..and the priest of Saint-Alban,
Henrie Sardis.

116
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,915
Tell us, mylord...

117
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,275
Are people talking a lot about
the Beast in Paris?

118
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,149
People even sang about it.
-They should prey.

119
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,709
Would captain Duhamel need
Gods help?

120
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,717
Who can without god's help?

121
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,316
Duhamel disguises his soldiers in
women.

122
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,752
To get the Beast. What a strategy.
-Duhamel does all he can.

123
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,999
I think you're obliging.
Duhamel is incapable.

124
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,672
They destroy a lot.
But the Beast is still there.

125
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,636
Like taxes are ment to be
for paying Duhamel...

126
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,308
...I rather give it to my
servants.

127
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,073
What do you think?

128
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:41,752
Mylord Duke likes carp at,
but he is a good christian.

129
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,598
When you arrived,
they were boring me...

130
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,274
...with the good God and all
that holy talk.

131
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,079
The pope would even have
sent a spy...

132
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,269
...to see if the Beast has anything 
to do with the devil.

133
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,357
Excuse me.

134
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,877
Marianne de Morangias.
Difficult, very difficult.

135
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,358
Everybody was breaking their minds 
about it.

136
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:38,719
Who is next?
-Maxime des Forets. Actor.

137
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:43,711
That will be easy.
-Be careful. He's a Morangias...

138
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,632
Mrs..
-Hello, mylord, we were talking..

139
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,836
Are you Maxime des Forets?

140
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,719
What a pleasure.
Good actors are rare.

141
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,110
The Marquis was talking about you.
-The Marquis?

142
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,754
He wants to have a chronicle written
about his family.

143
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,717
He's thinking about you.
-Is he?

144
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,271
He is in a good mood.
It's now or never.

145
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,830
But act like you don't know and
let him start talking about it.

146
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:10,871
Mrs. excuse me....

147
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,039
Aren't you ashamed?
-My God. No.

148
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,237
So, Mr. stuffer ... do you like
our region?

149
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,473
Until now i only saw beauties.
Or at least one of them.

150
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:27,557
Do people talk about girls 
this way in the court?

151
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,998
No... Something like this you
should save for the innocent farmers.


152
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,075
I would go to the court if
there were women like you.

153
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,273
Food is being served, Knight.
Let's eat.

154
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,436
I'll follow you.

155
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:48,232
We were in Saint-Laurent for 12 days
already when we found the most..

156
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,310
..bizarre animal in our nets I ever saw

157
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,869
The indians told me about
holy fish...

158
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:59,316
...but I was convinced it 
was a legend.

159
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:05,157
I saw a fish with the looks
and size of a trout.

160
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:10,394
...but it's body was completely covered
with a hairy skin as black as poison.

161
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:16,111
A hairy trout? You're joking.
-No, mylord.

162
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,515
Salmo Truta Dermopilla,
from Canada.

163
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,598
That is really strange.
-As soft as fur.

164
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,117
Nature is extraordinary.

165
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,390
The water will be cold...

166
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,235
It proves the impossible is
possible sometimes.

167
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,279
With this discovery you earned
a lot of respect.

168
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,431
I doubt he deserves that.

169
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,797
But I admit, Knight,
you got talent as an actor.

170
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,680
If I would have two hands,
I would give an applause.

171
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:05,235
Jean-Francois.
Please excuse him, mylord.

172
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,389
Your son is right,
Sr. Earl, that animal doesn't exist.

173
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:15,236
My embalmer in the garden of the 
King is very handy.

174
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,479
So you say the Beast does
not exist...

175
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,716
..and we are idiots?

176
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,792
I only say that...

177
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,316
people only used dragons or 
squirrels in books or poems.

178
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,153
Lies are sometimes true if 
they are being told correctly.

179
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,553
Watch out, mylord. We might not
understand you anymore now.

180
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,474
By the way, are you a 
philosopher?

181
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,437
Or worse... an actor?

182
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,797
I think the Knight is mainly
someone from Paris.

183
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,474
Enough about that Beast.

184
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,155
Shall we do some riddles?

185
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,871
I just made a poem.
If Mrs. Earl allows...

186
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,838
If it's not immoral.
-Immoral? No, no.

187
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,196
It's very chaste and sober.

188
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,830
It's not far-fetched.
Just popped into my head.

189
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,468
It's called "The Wolf".

190
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,719
''I did't pay any attention to
it.

191
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,236
Without thinking of evil,
I look at you

192
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,115
Your secret glance strikes me.

193
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,154
The wolf, the wolf, the wolf"

194
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,558
Will I see you again soon?

195
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:45,158
Do you have any other mystical animals?
-U have an indisputable idea about me.

196
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,995
Allow me to change that.
-Try it.

197
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,833
Will you be attending Duhamel's battue?
-Yes.

198
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:56,119
I forbid you.
It's far too dangerous.

199
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,551
Obediance is the first virtue
of young women.

200
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,432
That young man is right.

201
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:11,993
It was on that day the biggest battue
ever to be held in Gevaudan took place.

202
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,755
The King promised 6.000 pound
to the one who killed the Beast.

203
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:23,832
Thousands of peasants and soldiers
joined the hunters.

204
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:29,871
During a few houres we forgot
we were hunting the Beast.

205
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:33,074
Everyone got a map and a place
to assemble.  We start at 7.

206
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,909
Go ahead. My people have
other things to do.

207
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,554
Your generousity matches
your courage and...

208
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,230
Enough. I hope for your sake
that we catch it this time.

209
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,238
That's a certainty, Sir Duke.

210
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,196
What kind of racket is that?

211
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,312
A beautiful weapon, not?

212
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,678
I had it made by a weapons
blacksmith in Mende.

213
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,633
You understand that i wanted
it custom made.

214
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,712
Look...

215
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:13,833
...even in Paris you can't find
such bullets. I mould them myself.

216
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,514
Silver? You fear werewolves?

217
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,998
No, but i want to
leave a signature.

218
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,398
I'm a hunter.
Its a passion that has cost me a lot.

219
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,397
What happened to you?

220
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,839
I've learned that some predators
need more then a bullet.

221
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:36,795
There's more to curing gangreen
then a prayor.

222
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:40,470
Has a bear wounded you?
-A lion.

223
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,711
2 years in the marine
made me travel alot.

224
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,229
You dont know Africa, Fronsac.

225
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,318
Gentlemen... my daughter is to blame.

226
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,353
I'll bring her here.
Punish her accordingly.

227
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,878
A witch.

228
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,355
The daughter of the devil.

229
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,953
Look at her, a demon.

230
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:06,669
She's sick, she's not possessed.

231
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,828
She's not possessed.

232
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,039
The Evil. The sign of the devil.

233
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,398
Bewitched.

234
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,870
Make sure she doesnt swallow here tongue.
She will suffocate.

235
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,676
She's not possessed.

236
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,592
She's not possessed
-I know

237
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:42,033
Taxidermist, philosopher... And
even a healer.

238
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,478
Congratulations.

239
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,839
She didn't come.

240
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,278
Marquis.

241
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,237
And the people?

242
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,757
Supersticuous. Nothing different
than this place.

243
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,232
The Indians eat the heart of
their prey, for its strength.

244
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,431
Is that why they are savages?

245
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,593
In Africa they eat the 
heart of their enemies.

246
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,511
Sir Duke, Jean-Francois,
move your people eastwards.

247
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:43,872
There you are.
-Your mother will be worried.

248
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,278
If i had listened to her,
i wouldn't be in the convent.

249
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,557
I know you dont believe me,
you're a freethinker.

250
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,474
Not when one is in love.
-Are you in love?

251
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,798
Ridiculous. We hardly know eachother.

252
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,869
You think that its about you?

253
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,273
Marianne.

254
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,519
She has to learn to ride like a woman.

255
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,559
Practice never hurt anyone.

256
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,639
My father never sees any evil.
-My son sees evil in everything.

257
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,475
People died here.

258
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,277
How do you know that?

259
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,075
I hear their screams.
-Mani, stop that.

260
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,955
He's right.
There was an army camp here.

261
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,837
When it was torched,
25 hereticals died.

262
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,712
Is he psychic?

263
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,276
That's not needed.

264
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,871
To observe is sufficient.

265
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,032
When i was little,
i came to play here with my brother.

266
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:02,156
Weren't you afraid?

267
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,236
He would protect me against
the ghosts.

268
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:20,151
Don't you like the hunt?
-Is that a crime around here?

269
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,878
According to indian custom, you 
steal someone's soul if you draw them.

270
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,876
Does my soul interest you?

271
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,950
Why on foot?
Do you want to get mutilated?

272
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,033
It's my fault.
-I ask nothing of you.

273
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,712
What was that?
-Only a wolf.

274
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,475
And what if it was the Beast?
-I dont think it was, Marianne.

275
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,953
Thanks.

276
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,788
I hope the Beast is one
of the wolves.

277
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,719
They wont be eating anyone.

278
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,878
What a special person.

279
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,237
Where did you find him?
-In Canada.

280
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,435
It's... How does one say it.
An Acad?

281
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,757
An Indian. An Irok, 
from the tribe of the Mohawks.

282
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:59,675
An Indian? A real one?
He doesnt look like an Indian.

283
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,308
Makre sure that you're 
in Saint-Alban tonight.

284
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,511
We'll entertain ourselves with
your servant.

285
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,073
He's not my servant.

286
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,477
What is he then, cursed?
-My brother.

287
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:36,238
How can you mix your
blood with that of a savage?

288
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:39,472
He who shares my discomfort,
is no savage.

289
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,677
Because of Mani i was able
to escape from the English.

290
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,833
I thought those animals
were cannibals.

291
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:50,630
As you can see, Sir Intendant,
Mani is no animal.

292
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,275
Would you be able to procriate
with a woman of our race?

293
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,153
All women are equal once
the candles are extinguished.

294
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,354
Yes, they're clear of mind.

295
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,116
The Indians slept with white men
and had children. We are equals.

296
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,955
That's said hasty.
It's a bit like with black men...

297
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,071
What do you think of it, Sardis?

298
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,153
Your bloodbrother must be a child of God.

299
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,789
You had him baptised?
-He didnt ask me.

300
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,118
Good. You follow times closely.
-Mani has his own believe.

301
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,672
He was somesort of priest in
his tribe.

302
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,559
Do Indians have priests?
They are lost.

303
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,359
What is their believe?

304
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,796
Every human has a conginial
with the animals. A totem

305
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,872
Nice, but i don't understand.

306
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,639
Would you mind?

307
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,829
Don't be afraid. It won't hurt.

308
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,518
U...

309
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,590
Kariboe... thats somekind of 
deer.

310
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,718
Yes, a deer. What do you think?

311
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,959
Am I a deer by the horns or
by somebody else?

312
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,157
And my dear Thomas? What is his..

313
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,231
...totem?
-Worm.

314
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,437
A book-worm.

315
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,834
A snake?
-Snake?

316
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,150
With the Indians,
Snakes stand for wisdom

317
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,833
Wise snake.

318
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,513
And you, mylord Intendant?

319
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,913
A pig.

320
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,079
Away with those wrinkles.

321
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:57,438
With those barbarians the pigs
may represent nobility.

322
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:01,469
Who is next? Sardis?
-No. No

323
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,439
And me?

324
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:12,513
What am I? Half a lion, half
an eagle?

325
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:17,156
Change me in a lizard, so
my arm will grow back on.

326
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,151
Jean-Francois. Enough.

327
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:24,718
What's wrong? Am I going
too far?

328
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,190
Let me, let me.

329
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,636
Mrs., would you?

330
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,238
Excuse me, but your 
tricks bore me.

331
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,115
I choose to withdraw, before you
start dancing on a ball.

332
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,953
Good evening.

333
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,436
That will relax you.

334
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:06,108
It's not Paris, but it's the best
Mende offers.

335
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,313
And it sleeps better than in 
an inn.

336
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,908
They are all for you, gentlemen.
And we have a new...

337
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,351
My dear Marquis, come.

338
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,750
I'm expensive, Gregoire de Fronsac.

339
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,518
Do we know eachother?
-From here Gevaudan looks small.

340
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,758
ltalian?

341
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,078
A passage in this beautiful country.

342
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,031
I got some money.

343
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,875
Thats not the only issue.

344
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,153
And?

345
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,309
Who did that?

346
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,031
An Irokese arrow.

347
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,075
Your heart was not far away..

348
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,839
Maybe I am..
a man with luck.

349
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,152
And that?

350
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,712
A bear.

351
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,120
And he didn't love me.

352
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,959
You haven't seen anything yet.

353
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,910
I have a dangerous job.

354
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,156
Not all men have manners like you.

355
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:06,952
That's a recollection on me.

356
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:13,111
That is a scandal in my house.

357
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,514
Valentine. What is this?
-I don't sleep with wizards.

358
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:20,797
What does it mean?
-He got snakes on his body.

359
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,951
Our reputation is at risk.

360
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,596
It's nothing, it is an Indian.
Not a wizard.

361
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,792
I don't want Indians.
-You hookers are difficult.

362
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,274
And, girls?
Who's going with the Redskin?

363
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,948
I double the price.

364
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,517
I like his sketches...
-Well, everything is gonna be alright...

365
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:45,429
Are you a wizard?

366
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,236
Are you going to sketch me?

367
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,875
If your not honest.

368
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,831
Several weeks passed...

369
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,037
...and the soldiers
could't find the Beast.

370
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:03,156
It was the 3th winter
under his lordship...

371
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,794
...and we knew
the snow and the cold...

372
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,197
...just like our weapons,
would not make it stop.

373
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,512
Think about the threatens God 
announced through Mozes' mouth..

374
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,759
"I will come to you like a bear
lost her welps"

375
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,080
I shall tear your children
like a lion..

376
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:34,315
and send the Beast that will
consume you..

377
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:37,757
and your cattles,
and will make...

378
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,718
deserts of your roads."

379
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,717
How long will you stay angry, Lord?

380
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,077
One candle per victim.

381
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,272
Do you really think we live
in a rational time?

382
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:34,316
Mercy.

383
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,792
I ask forgiveness.

384
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,317
Mercy.

385
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,113
Bless me.

386
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:48,351
What is it, my son?

387
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,830
God punished me.
My children are gone.

388
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,675
I'm doomed.
We're all doommed.

389
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,912
Gather your men,
we leave at once.

390
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:08,750
Warn Mani, i see you on the way.

391
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,711
Goodeavening, friend of the wolves.

392
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,036
I'v got something for you.

393
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:30,117
I would like to speak with you, Marianne.
Alone.

394
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:37,112
In 10 days my mother and father
will both go away.

395
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,833
10 days?

396
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,276
I am not as free as you are.

397
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:03,399
Bring me the torch.

398
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,430
Bring the torch.

399
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,188
The storm starts and they are tired.

400
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:15,396
We'd better go home.

401
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,790
No. Let's find the girl.

402
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,675
I found the child.

403
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:22,158
Captain, those traps you set catch
more farmers than wolves.

404
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,790
Your men are leaded by misuse
of power.

405
00:48:26,280 --> 00:48:30,637
And since your chase the wolf has 
killed 12 times.

406
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:33,758
I don't understand.
It shouldn't have escaped.

407
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,878
What?
-It shouldn't have escaped.

408
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:43,234
And you, Knight, do you
know what kind of wolf it is?

409
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,232
Gentlemen...

410
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:51,714
The only certainty I have,
is that it's not a wolf.

411
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,075
A wolf does not attack people.
I observed them in Canada.

412
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,155
Maybe there the wolves are different.
A wild wolf would attack anybody.

413
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,233
If it gets frantic,
it will die in 2 weeks.

414
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:08,153
And still it's running around here
for 2 years now.

415
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:12,871
By the way, I saw wounds a wolf
could never have made.

416
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:19,196
And I found, in a body of a victim,
a piece of iron.

417
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:22,113
And?
-And?

418
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:26,714
No animal has iron teeth.

419
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:35,958
Is the Beast not an animal then?
Well, how do we catch it?

420
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,839
As we are talking, it kills people.

421
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:44,677
I think we should listen carefully
to Fronsac.

422
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:51,951
So, Knight, you think
The Beast is not an ordinary animal.

423
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:58,517
I'm glad you admit its something
extraordinary.

424
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:02,952
I don't admit anything Sir.
I only have my doubts.

425
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,628
Knight, do you have something
left to say?

426
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,833
No gentlemen.

427
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:12,512
Gentlemen, I received this from Paris.

428
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:18,956
Captain Duhamel, His Majesty
was informed about your mistakes..

429
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:22,476
... and I was asked to get 
you off this case.

430
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:26,838
You and your men leave at once
to your regiment in Langogne.

431
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,316
Sir Beauterne is already on his
way to Langogne.

432
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,473
His Majesty gave orders to kill
the wolf.

433
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:39,078
...and he is the only one who is
allowed to hunt in the district.

434
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:41,913
Gentlemen.

435
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,512
Have you forgiven me?

436
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:59,589
I would like to know my totem?
Do i say that properly?

437
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:01,478
I would say...

438
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,958
...a mermaid.

439
00:51:04,120 --> 00:51:08,318
You are never serious.
I will ask your Redskinned man.

440
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,599
And the Beast? Did you see it?

441
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,314
No.
-Don't you want to talk about it?

442
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:18,559
I could only make some absurd
suppositions.

443
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:23,477
When I say the Beast is made 
of flesh and iron...

444
00:51:23,640 --> 00:51:27,599
... that it can think and dissapear
when it wants to.

445
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:31,878
What would you think?
-That our air would make you talk nonsense.

446
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,957
People would think that it hides
for me.

447
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,630
You haven't been long here and
you already want to be finished.

448
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,752
Did you think the Beast would
surrender that easily?

449
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,839
Maybe it's scared of you.
-Am I so scary then?

450
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,998
You enjoy a lot more from a
difficult victory.

451
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,471
Jean-Francois said you wanted to
go to Africa.

452
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,155
It's a dream of a taxidermist
who is fed up with the winter.

453
00:51:57,320 --> 00:52:00,790
And you? Don't you want to
discover other regions?

454
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,391
The women have more duties then
desires.

455
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,955
Do you see Sardis on the walls?

456
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,474
Does he keep an eye on you?
-No

457
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,631
It watches me.

458
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,236
Alone with you in the park.
Who knows what will happen.

459
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:20,990
Come, the priest will catch a 
cold.

460
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,630
Goodnight, Knight.

461
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,795
Goodnight, Knight.

462
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,550
You're in love.
-I don't know.

463
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,398
I know.

464
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:52,192
The maps?

465
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,233
I didn't need them for you.

466
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:58,829
Let us drink.

467
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:03,159
To Mrs. Morangias.

468
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,153
Why?

469
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,028
Her brother was there too that night.

470
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,998
Did you sleep with him?

471
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:15,919
With him?
He is not to be touched.

472
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,196
He looks, he drinks...

473
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:23,591
...and when he's drunk, he talks
in his sleep. Like all men.

474
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,274
Do I talk in my sleep?

475
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,392
What do I say then?

476
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,875
Do you know how Florentine women keep
their men at home?

477
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,234
They give their husbands slowly working
poison each morning.

478
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,995
...and each night an antidote.

479
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,473
Men who sleep elsewhere will have
a bad night because of that.

480
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:01,754
A women like you doesn't need that.

481
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,071
And by the way, we're not married.

482
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:32,956
Make room for Antoine de Beauterne..

483
00:55:33,160 --> 00:55:37,119
...carrier of His Majesty, who will
release the region..

484
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,476
...of the Beast.

485
00:55:57,360 --> 00:56:02,309
Mylord, I am Gregoire de Fronsac.
-Oh I remember. The servant of Buffon.

486
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,277
The taxidermist and balmer.

487
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:08,228
He sleeps with the intendant.
We have an appointment at 2 exactly.

488
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:50,359
His Majesty asked me your opinion
about your report.

489
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:54,034
Complicated fables...

490
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:58,435
I think the Beast is a wolf.

491
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:03,873
Tomorrow I will leave to investigate.

492
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:06,469
I don't want you to join me.

493
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:11,513
Why not?

494
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,993
The King wants me to do it..

495
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,879
...and me alone..

496
00:57:18,040 --> 00:57:21,157
I don't need you to complete this.

497
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:28,356
You'll find a letter signed by 
Buffon on the table..

498
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,511
...and our beloved King.

499
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:35,234
I am inferior to him.
But believe me, it's not...

500
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:39,638
I read your report. Don't waste
energy for the Beast anymore.

501
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,235
I will take care of it.

502
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:44,873
You can go.

503
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,799
Come, come, come.

504
00:57:54,120 --> 00:57:55,872
Come.

505
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,149
A women from Lorciere.
She came back from a party.

506
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:11,239
We lost it south of the Mouchet.
It just dissapeared.

507
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:13,908
Knight, the Beast attacked a women
in Saint-Alban.

508
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,999
God punished me,
my children are gone.

509
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,595
No more than you I believe in
monsters.

510
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:32,509
His snout was longer and 
the teeth are like knifes.

511
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,154
The only certainty is that it's
not a wolf.

512
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:38,193
It's not an animal?
-A frantic wolf attacks everyone.

513
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,709
How do we catch it?

514
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,036
No animal has iron teeth.

515
00:59:43,360 --> 00:59:45,794
Knight, you have to come at once.

516
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,831
I saw it.

517
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:54,671
He poored poison and said 
satanic words.

518
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,630
God knows how long this has been
going on.

519
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:10,471
Let him be.

520
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:14,117
It's an Indian remedy.

521
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,595
Only our prairs can save her

522
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:20,235
But.... She was not...

523
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:22,113
A miracle.

524
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,511
Tell me.
What happend to your brother?

525
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:17,390
A man with the Beast.
-She doesn't know what she is saying.

526
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:39,429
Yes, mylord. The Beast is dead.

527
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:42,399
Ten bullets. 
It didn't survive.

528
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:51,908
We brought the necessary.
Start at once.

529
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,390
That's not the beast.
-Start. Mr. Beauterne is coming.

530
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:05,876
Rediculous. This is not the Beast.
-Like I said, Mr. Beauterne is coming.

531
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:10,392
I dont like the way you work.
-Bye, Knight. Leave us.

532
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:13,438
And, Fronsac? Don't you like my
Beast?

533
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:17,639
What's the meaning of this?
You know this is not the Beast.

534
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:23,158
His jaws are twice as big as these.
-You got everything to fix that.

535
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:26,437
I must bring the Beast to Paris,
and I got this wolf.

536
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:28,835
You should make a Beast for me.

537
01:02:29,040 --> 01:02:32,396
Do you want the King to believe..
-No, Fronsac.

538
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:34,869
I carry out his will.

539
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,752
You should too. That would be wise.
-Are you threatening me, mylord?

540
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:43,599
On my age?
You know who I am.
541
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,718
...and you're too intelligent
to have yourself threatend.

542
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,952
If you do your job, the king 
will be grateful.

543
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,072
If you don't do your job he 
will be very dissapointed.

544
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:57,831
Do you have everything you need?
I'm counting on you. See you soon.
