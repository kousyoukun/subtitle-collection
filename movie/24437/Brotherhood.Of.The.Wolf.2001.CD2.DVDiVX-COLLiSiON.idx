545
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,439
On this historical day, I would first 
like to thank Knight Gregoire de Fronsac.

546
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,479
The Beast is dead and we owe 
him our grattitude.

547
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,951
But its especially thanks to you, Majesty.

548
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,475
It has to be said...

549
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,872
...it's in your person the
royal power lives.

550
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,156
Only an animal can ignore it,
but that animal is dead.

551
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,751
There's very little to thank me for.

552
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,152
Together with your power I only
had to show myself briefly in Gevaudan...

553
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,517
...so that the Beast would seize it's fight.

554
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,675
What's all this hypocricy about ?

555
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,549
Beauterne is executing his orders.
We should do the same.

556
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,035
What orders?
-Mine.

557
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,678
Fronsac, this is Mister Mercier...

558
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,078
...advisor of His Majesty
for domestic affairs.

559
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,909
He had the idea to send Beaterne there.

560
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,112
So its you who we have to 
thank for this victory?

561
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:32,068
Your scruples do you credit,
but this is domestic business.

562
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,636
Did you read this?

563
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,397
You can no longer find
this in the bookstore.

564
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,553
Did you have it banned?
-It mocked the king.

565
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,714
If we had waited to long,
it would've become tedious.

566
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,239
So it is better to lie
than to let lies be spoken.

567
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,589
The truth is too complicated.
To rule, everything has to be simple.

568
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,678
The Beast was a problem.
Beast gone, problem too.

569
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,348
It will continue to kill.
-No one will know though.

570
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,470
That is what matters. His
Majesty keeps himself to thanking you.

571
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,359
He heard you want to go to Africa.

572
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,069
In about 6 months a ship sets sail
to Senegal.

573
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,634
If you want, you can accomany it.

574
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,230
And ofcourse we keep quiet about Gevaudan.

575
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,910
Well, Fronsac?

576
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,193
Officialy the Beast was dead.

577
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,753
What really happened,
is not mentioned in the history books.

578
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,349
It has been assured that
this will be kept quiet.

579
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,072
Does he welcome us?
-He wants to help us.

580
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,474
Go to the castle, i'll come later.

581
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,990
Fransec let Mani prepare the hunt.

582
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,273
The Beast was not his only 
reason for his return.

583
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,032
What's the matter?

584
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,435
The house of Jeanne and Pierre Roulier?

585
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,672
Straight ahead.
The last house of the village.

586
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,117
This is Jeanne, my wet nurse.

587
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,078
Gregoire de Fronsac.

588
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,038
Pierre, go get the whine.

589
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,557
My mother checks up on me.
They'll know you're here.

590
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,871
To hell with that. I'm getting you 
out of here.

591
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:26,470
I will no longer put up with
my mother and Jean-Francois.

592
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,557
I want to leave, go far away.

593
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,555
Within a week we'll go to Paris.
-Why wait?

594
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,711
I'm going back to hunt.

595
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,714
I promised to the Marquis.
-I thought you came for me?

596
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,513
Watch out.

597
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,917
Marianne, go away, without running.

598
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:24,792
Come closer... Look at me.
Get over here you. Come here.

599
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,993
Get over here. Come on.

600
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,831
Go away, Marianne.

601
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:23,270
What's going on here?
Open up, Pierre.

602
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,873
My God.

603
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,074
Tell me, Knight,
will we really find the Beast?

604
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,152
I thought there would be more.

605
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,629
I'm hunting a man.

606
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,799
A man?

607
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,999
The Beast is an instrument
in the hands of a sick mind.

608
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,959
A murderer works more discrete.
-Correct, Marquis.

609
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,271
The first mysterie of the Beast
is its fame.

610
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,074
It has to be discussed.
There has to be fear.

611
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:41,716
How do you mean?
-This book was sold everywhere.

612
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,753
That author says 
the Beast punishes the King...

613
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,198
...for his comprehension for the filosofers.
-Bullshit. Who wrote that?

614
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,239
I dont know, but the Beast
has a master and i want him.

615
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,757
Eventually your weapon
could have use to us.

616
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,911
On the condition that you wear it.

617
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:26,549
And you Mani, what weapon will you take?
-Mani doesn't liker fireweapons.

618
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,828
Too much noise, too much smoke.
Bad scent.

619
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,431
Everything will go as planned, grandfather.

620
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,558
Don't worry.
We prepared everything.

621
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,639
Tell about America, Knight.
-America?

622
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,600
Will you never go back?
-Not all my memories are good ones.

623
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:23,073
-And doesnt Mani miss his tribe?
-His tribe no longer exists.

624
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,234
When we attacked his village,
the smallpocks had wiped it out.

625
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,035
We had to kill the survivors, the women...

626
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,313
...as well as all the children.
Only Mani escaped it.

627
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:39,155
How?
-The captain wanted a translater.

628
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,276
I had to teach him our language.

629
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,238
Three weeks later he killed
the captain.

630
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,039
Why didn't you report him?

631
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,953
Do you know how he fought his battles?

632
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,159
He gave his scouts dirty sheets and linnen.

633
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,231
The Irokese bought them.

634
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,955
And three weeks later we came by.

635
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,591
Is that how they waged war?
-Thats how we lost it.

636
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,635
Where did he go to?

637
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,753
Talking to the trees.
-The trees?

638
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,877
The trees talk.

639
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:19,598
White men can't hear nor listen.

640
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,876
See what, Mani?

641
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,273
Do you want to learn?

642
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,637
What's that?
-An Indian host.

643
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,473
At your own risk, Marquis.

644
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,152
Does it matter?

645
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,751
Depends from person to person.

646
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,236
The indians say that one can
see that what is invisible.

647
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,191
So, Mani?
-The Beast is in the forest.

648
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,351
The wolves will help.
-I don't see anything.

649
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:58,877
Tonight we dance
the dance of the blood.

650
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,192
And the Beast will come to us
at sunrise.

651
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,239
It doesnt seem to affect me...

652
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,072
The night called onto Mani and 
the spirits of the forest...

653
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,353
...in a language even
Knight de Fronsac couldn't understand.

654
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,597
The wolves brought the Beast to them.

655
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,515
Don't worry, it'll be alright.

656
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,029
It'll all be fine.
I shall tend to you.

657
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,716
I will do anything for you.

658
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,638
Thomas is sleeping.
It was close.

659
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,588
I'm sorry about the Indian.

660
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,430
What's that there? Tell me what it is.
I need to know.

661
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,916
Its a domain. A hunting ground.

662
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,954
Knight... You have to rest.

663
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,717
Hurry. Fire.

664
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:49,797
There he is. Kill him.

665
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,035
The Knight came from Mani's body.

666
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:18,111
His thirst for revenge is far from
quenched.

667
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,909
But according to Indian tradition
he has to help his friend...

668
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,874
...at sunset to go back to
his ancestors.

669
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,671
What do you want?

670
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,993
There has been too much bloodshed here.

671
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,118
You risk the worst if you don't leave.

672
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,198
I won't leave, i have to arrange something.

673
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,550
Is it worth your life?

674
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:51,269
Sinds when do you know?
-I have no idea what you mean.

675
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,552
Come on, Sardis. How is this possible?

676
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:58,271
How did it ever get so far?

677
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,675
No one will believe you.

678
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:05,275
Go away, Sardis.

679
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:08,477
May God have mercy on your soul.

680
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:12,234
And that the Devil may come get yours.

681
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,718
You are under arrest.

682
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,678
On the ground of the power
of the intendant...

683
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,910
...I ask you to accompany
us without resisting.

684
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,640
That's ridiculous, lieutenant.

685
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,674
Chef. There's a lady here who wants
to talk to you. - Later. Tonight.

686
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,911
Mercy. Mercy.

687
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,475
Come on, get up. You got a
visitor.

688
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,717
Not in seclusion anymore?
-Depends for whom.

689
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,438
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,875
Bring your guest some food.

691
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:56,549
Why?
-I ow a lot of people.

692
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,629
You have to help me.
I have to write to the King.

693
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,356
You will be hanged before
your letter reaches him.

694
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,750
Impossible.
I didnt stand trial yet.

695
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,799
Here.

696
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,671
What do you know about the Beast?
-A trained animal...

697
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,276
Covered with armour-plating.
I wounded it.

698
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,076
Sinds when does that interest you?
-Two years ago...

699
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,155
...a confidential letter from
Sardis was delivered to the Pope.

700
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,750
He reported the foundation
of a secret society...

701
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,548
...with the purpose...
...of making it known...

702
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:44,271
...and with all means defend
the word of the Church:

703
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,999
''The Pact''.

704
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,318
Sardis...

705
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,110
He used the Beast.

706
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,116
The Beast is...

707
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,669
...a warning for the King.

708
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,879
Take the Lords power into account,
or you risk the Apocalypse.

709
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,636
The conspirators called themselves
the Wolves of God.

710
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,280
The Pact works for the Church.

711
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:19,116
Sardis only works for himself.
Truth made him mad.

712
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,392
And Rome has no control over
its organization.

713
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,352
And who do you work for?

714
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,719
I get payed to work
and also to deny i work.

715
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,995
And you? You know enough.

716
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,635
Miss de Morangias.
To what do i owe the honour?

717
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,715
How are you madame countess?
Be seated.

718
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,557
And your father ? Still on a diet?

719
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,557
He loves good food too much.

720
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:12,192
Mylord de Intandan, you had
Knight de Fronsac arrested.

721
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:15,875
Who would ever think that someone
like him could fall so low.

722
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,948
He's nor a bandit, nor a murderer.
-I see.

723
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,669
I'm sure he had his reasons.

724
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,274
Those men might have killed
that Indian.

725
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:30,149
That's not the point.
Even if it is so...

726
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,557
...a savage is not avanged
with the blood of christians.

727
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,878
I want to see him.

728
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,116
Impossible.

729
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,073
Good.

730
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,398
We'll see how they think about
that in Paris.

731
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,473
Marianne, you don't understand me.
Knight de Fronsac has...

732
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,678
...deceased...

733
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,033
Anyway,
he would've been hang.

734
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,637
Actually, he was lucky.

735
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,753
He was your responsability.

736
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,598
Maybe he choked.

737
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:32,639
Unless he caught a desease.
-Liar. You're all liars...

738
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,870
Be brave. It's God's will.

739
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,912
Reverend...
-Marianne...

740
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,989
...come, i will bring you back to the castle.
-Miss de Morangias has to rest.

741
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:48,153
Come on...
-No.

742
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:51,637
Leave me.
-There's nothing more you can do.

743
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,437
He already smells bad.

744
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,632
Burry him quick.
And forget the name on his grave.

745
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:03,877
She threatened to warn the king.

746
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,236
She's dangerous...

747
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,070
Gregoire de Fronsac
was burried that night...

748
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:19,519
...even before the news of his death
reached Paris.

749
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:23,468
No one knew what secrets he
took with him into his grave.

750
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:28,676
A few days now, the Beast
has layed silent...

751
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:33,035
...but the sudden dissapearing
of his most fierce opponent...

752
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,073
...was a gloomy omen.

753
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,879
Hurry up.

754
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:08,271
I admit my mistakes.
I have sinned.

755
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:09,913
Forgive me.

756
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:14,632
Day and night i think of her.

757
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,917
I can feel her heart beat in my chest.

758
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:23,794
I want her to be on my side.
-The Lord is testing you.

759
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,633
You dont know what i'm going through.

760
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:36,071
There are images, those damned images
who keep turning up.

761
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:44,358
Free me, Reverend.
Free me. I beg you.

762
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:49,871
For the evil that eats away at me,
there is but one cure.

763
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,352
No.

764
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,636
No, don't drink.

765
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:58,673
They want to kill you,
but i will stop them.

766
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,230
Who, Jean-Francois?

767
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:04,873
Who?

768
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,114
We'll leave, Marianne.
You and me.

769
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,070
What do you think of America?
-Jean-Francois...

770
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,512
You made me suffer, but i forgave you.

771
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,316
Please, what are you doing?

772
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,637
What are you doing? Stay there.

773
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:37,630
Do you think I will hurt you?
-Stay where you are. Please.

774
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,155
Marianne, I need you.

775
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:44,876
You saved me when i was ill,
and no one else.

776
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,080
I saw your face after my nightmares.

777
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,390
Your hand that chased away the demons.

778
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:54,917
You don't realize what I did to keep
you close to me. Please...

779
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:57,071
Don't reject me.

780
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,513
Why?

781
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,758
Do i discust you?

782
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,276
You don't scare me. Go away...

783
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,276
It's because of this...

784
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:29,156
Don't worry,
i will take care of you now.

785
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:36,514
Look, no one knows.
Only Sardis and I.

786
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:55,676
Leave. Go away.
-Why?

787
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,637
Why?
-You're not my brother.

788
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,079
It's someone else who
returned from Africa.

789
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,636
Indeed, but its because of you
I got involved.

790
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:11,549
Without you all this would
never have happened.

791
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,273
Is this all?

792
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:28,272
It's your scent, you're awfull scent
the Beast perceived on me.

793
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:34,278
We have the same blood, Marianne.

794
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,711
When father returns,
he will kill you.

795
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,239
And if i kill him? He's been 
bothering us for some time now.

796
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,752
Go ahead. Do it, do it.

797
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,520
Go on.

798
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:15,797
Why didn't you do it?

799
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,990
It's not that difficult. Look.

800
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,634
Stop.
-Do you love me?

801
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,473
Cut it out.

802
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,280
Marianne, I love you.

803
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:35,430
Brothers.
The Lord has told me.

804
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,515
The Beast shall return and announce
the rebirth of our values.

805
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,788
...and a new France shall be born.

806
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:53,034
We shall be the invisible princes.
Because God is on our side.

807
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:08,110
The people had not seen the wrath of God yet.

808
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:15,231
The unjust reprimand of the King will
clash with the terror of the rabble.

809
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:21,032
And when it peaks, we will be able
to enter an agreement with the King.

810
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:23,953
If he was unable to make a Beast
subject to him...

811
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:27,112
...what would he do if
in every province...

812
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:30,636
...more Beasts would emerge?

813
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,877
The hour on which we will reap
what we have sowed approaches.

814
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:41,352
Read the book of Maleachi:

815
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:46,151
''The lips of a preacher
must keep the knowledge...

816
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:50,472
...and from his mouth one
expects the lore...

817
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:53,872
...for he is the messenger
of Jahwe of the army..

818
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:56,429
''When someone idolizes the Beast...

819
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:03,868
...he will face the wrath of God,
and he will burn in the fire...

820
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:09,071
...in the presence of the messengers,
and his pain wil last...

821
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:13,438
...for all eternity.''
I come to name you before God.

822
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:17,309
Pierre-Jean Laffont.
Genevieve de Morangias.

823
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:19,710
Maxime des Forets.

824
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:23,469
Gontrand de Moncan. Henri Sardis.

825
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,275
Jean-Francois de Morangias.

826
00:52:12,080 --> 00:52:13,877
Fire.

827
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:28,197
Bloody twats,
you're all under arrest.

828
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:20,909
Ghost that you are,
I will cut you in half.

829
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:37,352
Je dont have to hold back.
-I didnt intend to.

830
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:40,671
Too late, Fronsac.
Now the Beast is immortal.

831
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,633
But you're not.

832
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:35,638
Sardis trained you and you
trained the Beast.

833
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,713
Your signature is a silver bullet.

834
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:33,989
Marianne, look.

835
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,874
Marianne isn't here, poor soul.

836
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:51,668
You've united us for eternity.

837
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,992
Line'm up, men!

838
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,594
Stay where you are.
Who do you think you are?

839
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:28,150
Sit over there, you.
-Well well.

840
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:33,030
Not so tough now, are we?
Where are you off to, robin.

841
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,353
Go on.

842
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,790
He's dead.
-Now it's certain.

843
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,473
And Sardis?

844
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,154
Where-ever he goes,
we will find him.

845
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:03,278
Otherwise the mountains will take
care of him.

846
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:08,552
Shall we celebrate our succes 
with dignity?

847
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:13,754
You've killed me once before.
-To arise better.

848
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:18,637
I can introduce you to Rome.

849
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,031
Shall i accompany you?

850
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:31,638
To late. I appreciate you, Fronsac.
You'll have to make me forget my duties.

851
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,795
Leave, before I change my mind.

852
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:16,712
Marquis, what's going on?

853
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,878
Marianne... She's with us.

854
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:21,593
She's dying.

855
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,435
Be gone. Get out. Everyone leave.

856
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,511
Marianne. Wake up.

857
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:51,951
Marianne. Forgive me.

858
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,638
I love you.

859
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:24,909
Years went by...

860
01:01:25,120 --> 01:01:29,716
...but Gregoire de Fronsac and Marianne
de Morangias never left me.

861
01:01:30,680 --> 01:01:34,639
The world that spawned the Beast
is dissapearing...

862
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:40,314
...and i have to hurry
to reach my stories' end.

863
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:51,076
I can still see myself accompany
the Knight...

864
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,158
...to the secret refuge of
Jean-Francois...

865
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:57,477
...where the beast awaited its end.

866
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:38,514
The old healer told everything
he knew.

867
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:41,839
Jean-Francois brought a strange
kind of beast from Africa.

868
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:44,309
...which gave birth.

869
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,158
He only kept one.

870
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,438
The strongest offspring.

871
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:54,916
Patiently and unrelenting he
trained it to be the most vicious animal.

872
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:08,158
And so the Beast of Gevaudan
came to its end.

873
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:11,952
And I, Thomas d'Apcher...

874
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,914
...am without doubt the last
who knows the entire truth.

875
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,756
The Knight asked me to
accompany him to Africa.

876
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,791
But the country had
to be rebuild.

877
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:56,633
...and i kept true to my
people and country.

878
01:04:57,720 --> 01:05:00,871
I frequenty thought
of Gregoire and Marianne...

879
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:06,068
...during the peaceful years who
lead me to old age.

880
01:05:07,120 --> 01:05:09,634
I never saw them again...

881
01:05:10,120 --> 01:05:13,556
...but I rejoice at the thought
of them being happy...

882
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,517
...far from here
