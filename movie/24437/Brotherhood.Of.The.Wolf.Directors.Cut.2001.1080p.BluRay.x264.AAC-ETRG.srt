1
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:33,030
Milord, time is short.
Leave now, I beg you.

2
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,861
You'll be arrested.

3
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,946
Fetch some candles.

4
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:39,444
I'll be working late.

5
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,031
And my usual glass of wine.

6
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:48,879
This world had to change.

7
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:52,379
But the revolution is sweeping the land

8
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,133
and now it's my turn
to be swept aside.

9
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,633
Old prejudices make men blind...

10
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:02,801
Drive them mad...

11
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:07,890
Devour his heart
and turn him into a beast.

12
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,825
In the year 1764,

13
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:45,829
the beast reached our soll,
and made it hers.

14
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:51,418
A year later, her fame had spread
beyond the borders of our province,

15
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:56,002
and it seemed no mortal
would ever overcome her.

16
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:57,833
The beast's assaults

17
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:02,171
slowly sank
the region of gévaudan into darkness.

18
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,747
Who goes there?

19
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,346
What's he done?

20
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,675
- What?
- He's a thief.

21
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,851
- And her?
- His daughter.

22
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:00,439
Damned witch!

23
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,935
I healed their horses; They owe me.

24
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,525
Don't listen. All liars!

25
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,528
- Did he heal the horses?
- Yes.

26
00:06:21,715 --> 00:06:22,715
Begone!

27
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:51,237
Welcome to the land of the beast!
Beware of wolf traps!

28
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,328
Sir grégoire de fronsac,

29
00:06:56,917 --> 00:07:01,331
and the man they called mani,
were neither hunters nor soldiers.

30
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:03,085
Naturalist at king's garden,

31
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,086
Paris knew fronsac as a libertine

32
00:07:07,177 --> 00:07:08,337
and a fine wit.

33
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:11,086
The man who shadowed him

34
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:15,348
was a mysterious foreigner.

35
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,595
At nightfall, the travelers arrived

36
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,106
at the castle of Marquis d'apcher
their protector

37
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,936
in gévaudan
for the duration of their mission.

38
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:59,051
Our people fear no ordinary wolf.
The beast is different.

39
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:03,897
She flees men
as if she knew to fear them,

40
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,649
yet spares no woman or child.

41
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,984
Have you ever seen it?

42
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:12,822
How do you know
it's just one animal?

43
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:17,824
The survivors all say the same.
She's bigger than a wolf,

44
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,159
and has no fear of firearms.

45
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,325
I understand your skepticism.

46
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:27,917
I don't believe in dragons either.

47
00:08:28,091 --> 00:08:30,252
I've had a report drawn up,

48
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,594
a memoir of the beast"s crimes.

49
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,514
Judge for yourself.

50
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:44,020
You battled the english in new France?

51
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:48,941
Yes, I went to study
animals and nature.

52
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,854
I returned with wounds
and a captain's rank.

53
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,277
I've organized a hospital

54
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:02,205
for victims of the beast.
In an old priory.

55
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:04,949
A woman from lorciere.

56
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,875
On her way from the fair,
the beast attacked.

57
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:13,379
Two men saved her, the beast fled.
But took half her face.

58
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:18,301
Tell me, how is m. Buffon?

59
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,887
And how fares Paris?

60
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,227
And I'ingenu? Have you read it?

61
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:31,734
It's a bit late
to discuss philosophy.

62
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:34,817
Quite right. Let's speak of theater.

63
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:39,234
Do you know any actresses?
What's in the theater this winter?

64
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,577
Put it there.

65
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:46,583
A gallant lot, it's said.
I've read some offer their charms.

66
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,751
Do tell me.

67
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,925
Here, to satisfy your curiosity.

68
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,588
The mercure de France!
We only get the courrier d'avignon.

69
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,016
- I'll show you the common room.
- He'll stay here.

70
00:10:04,187 --> 00:10:06,348
Very well. Good night, sir.

71
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:15,277
Not versailles, but the wine's good.

72
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,750
It's big as a cow.

73
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,422
Jacques says he's seen many wolves.

74
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:29,352
This is not a wolf. It has
a longer snout, teeth with knives.

75
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,527
If not a wolf, what was it then?

76
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,111
A demon.

77
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,533
Chevalier!

78
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,119
The beast has struck near St. alban.

79
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,230
There.

80
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,722
There's no one there.

81
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,648
Halt!

82
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,485
What are those bastards doing here?

83
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:21,066
Good day, captain.

84
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:27,072
Good day, Marquis. My respects.

85
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:29,488
Beware. There are traps.

86
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,075
Duhamel, sir grégoire de fronsac

87
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,584
of the king's gardens.

88
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:39,756
He'd like to examine her body.
With your permission, of course.

89
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:44,086
The one who brutalized my men?

90
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,922
- Had I known you ordered...
- I did not.

91
00:12:48,935 --> 00:12:52,098
You did well, and I beg your pardon.

92
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:55,935
They're soldiers.
Trained for war, not hunting.

93
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,519
Careful, she's stuffed with poison.

94
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,701
What sort of gardener are you?

95
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:16,788
When the beast is killed,
his majesty wants it studied

96
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:18,453
in Paris.

97
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,794
I'll keep it after it's captured.

98
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,791
I'm having a look.

99
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,632
With that jaw,
it must weigh 500 pounds.

100
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,468
This time, I'll get it.

101
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,974
Before the snows.

102
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:38,314
It can't get away.

103
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,896
- Ever seen it?
- Once.

104
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:44,317
Once, in my musket sight.
I wounded her,

105
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,899
my word on it.
She collapsed, then at once revived.

106
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,245
We lost her near mount mouchet,
vanished in the wood.

107
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,160
Did it look like this?

108
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:02,331
She had a black stripe
and spike on her back.

109
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,516
My friends,

110
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,941
this is the sketch artist,

111
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,020
sir grégoire de fronsac,

112
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,523
a man of Providence indeed,
come from Paris to...

113
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:29,861
Sketch the beast.

114
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,866
His eminence, bishop of mende,

115
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,201
the Duke de moncan,

116
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,954
the count de morangias,

117
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:41,294
and madame the countess,

118
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,213
and their son Jean-francois

119
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,795
who's also traveled.

120
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,304
- A clever hand, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

121
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,218
M. Laffont,

122
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,894
our intendent.

123
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,556
Father Henri sardis,

124
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:03,061
of St. alban's.

125
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,904
Tell us, sir, 1s there talk
of the beast in Paris?

126
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:15,741
- They've written ballads.
- Prayers would do better!

127
00:15:16,249 --> 00:15:18,991
Does capt. Duhamel so need god?

128
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,749
Don't we all?

129
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:24,667
Duhamel's just dresses
his men as women

130
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,585
to bait the beast.

131
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,251
He's doing what he can.

132
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,002
Such indulgence.

133
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,675
Duhamel is incompetent.

134
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,926
His hunts exhaust the people,
his ruffians devastate our land,

135
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,760
and the beast goes free.

136
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:44,273
If duhamel is all I get
for paying my taxes to Paris,

137
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,439
I'd rather give it to my valets.

138
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,441
What do you say, sir?

139
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,697
You're not obliged to reply.

140
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,284
His lordship likes to argue,
but he's a good Christian.

141
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,612
When you arrived, this assembly

142
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,120
was talking my ears off
with god this and god that.

143
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,961
It's said the pope
sent a spy to see

144
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:09,461
if the beast is
a manifestation of the devil.

145
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:35,066
Pardon me.

146
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,832
Marianne de morangias.
A daunting task indeed.

147
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,089
Must have a loose screw.

148
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:54,336
- Who's that coming undone?
- Des foréts, a playwright.

149
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,344
- Then it's simple.
- Careful, she's a morangias.

150
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,013
Sir, we were conferring...

151
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:08,433
- M. Des foréts?
- Himself.

152
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:11,193
An honor. Good writers are rare.

153
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,776
Marquis d'apcher spoke of you.

154
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,029
He thought of you for his memoirs.

155
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:18,203
Really?

156
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:22,538
He's in good spirits.
But have some finesse.

157
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,867
Wait 'til he broaches the subject.

158
00:17:26,546 --> 00:17:27,706
Excuse me.

159
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,876
- Have you no shame?
- None.

160
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,719
Does the naturalist
like our country?

161
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,224
I've only so far glimpsed
its beauties - or one of them.

162
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,390
Is such the talk of court?

163
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,390
No, this is a couplet
reserved for provincials.

164
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,978
I might go to court
if there were ladies like you.

165
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:59,158
Dinner is served. Let's go in.

166
00:17:59,412 --> 00:18:00,822
Whither thou goest...

167
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:08,493
In sailing up the St. Lawrence
we found in our nets

168
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,338
the strangest animal
I'd ever seen.

169
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,669
I'd heard of the
native's sacred fish,

170
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:24,009
I was looking at a fish,
the shape and size of a trout,

171
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:30,352
but which was entirely covered
in a rich black fur.

172
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,352
A furry trout? Surely you jest.

173
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:36,028
No, sir.

174
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,456
Salmo truta dermopilla.

175
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:52,962
From Canada.

176
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,373
Soft as mink.

177
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,808
- Nature is extraordinary.
- The water must be cold.

178
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,220
Which proves the impossible
may be possible.

179
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:10,315
Well said.

180
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,475
It surely won you the king's favor.

181
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,894
I doubt he deserves it.

182
00:19:16,405 --> 00:19:19,568
Though I do recognize
your talent for acting.

183
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,567
Had I two hands, I'd applaud.

184
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:29,332
- Please pardon him.
- Your son is right.

185
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,334
This animal doesn't exist.

186
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,168
My taxidermist is a clever man.

187
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:37,923
Please excuse the prank.

188
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,924
Should this fable convince us
there is no beast?

189
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,426
That we're simpletons?

190
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,595
The moral of the fable

191
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:50,349
is that dragons and unicorns
only appear in fables.

192
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:53,515
Lies appear true dressed in Latin.

193
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:58,110
Careful, sir. We may lose
all sense of what you're saying.

194
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:02,027
Indeed, are you a naturalist
or a philosopher?

195
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,032
Or worse - an actor!

196
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:07,366
I believe the knight
is mostly Parisian.

197
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:11,036
Enough talk of the beast
which prays on peasants.

198
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,202
How about a guessing game?
Charades?

199
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:18,965
I've just composed a lover's lament.
May I, countess?

200
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,380
- If it isn't licentious?
- Oh no.

201
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,887
It's very chaste and pure.

202
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:28,808
It's a improvisation,
it's called...

203
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,475
"Wolves howl”.

204
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,817
I went not warily.

205
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,570
Though I bore no malice, verily,

206
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,484
your sly eye caught my heart
in its prowl!

207
00:20:45,828 --> 00:20:47,568
I howl!

208
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,836
Shall I see you soon?

209
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,256
Another tall tale to amaze me?

210
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:13,428
You seem set in your idea of me.
Allow me to change your mind.

211
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:14,933
Try.

212
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:18,437
- Coming to the hunt?
- Certainly.

213
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:22,603
I can't allow it. Too dangerous.

214
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:26,612
Obedience is the virtue
of well-born girls.

215
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,526
This young man is right.

216
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,542
There was, that day in géevaudan,

217
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,711
the greatest hunt ever in France.

218
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,384
The king offered 6,000 pounds
bounty for the beast.

219
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,886
Thousands of enlisted peasants,
swordsmen and soldiers,

220
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:51,549
but also every hunter
and adventurer in the region.

221
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:54,222
For a few hours,

222
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,472
we forgot we were the hunted.

223
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:03,546
You each have a map and a location.
Movements begin at seven.

224
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:04,371
Thank you.

225
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,134
You might well thank us!
My people have better things to do.

226
00:23:08,304 --> 00:23:11,046
Your generosity rivals your courage.

227
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,807
Enough. For your sake,
we'd better take her.

228
00:23:14,977 --> 00:23:17,639
We shall, your lordship.

229
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:21,563
What is this ruckus?

230
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,177
Fine weapon, isn't it?

231
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:42,514
I had it made in mende,
after a campaign.

232
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,342
Custom-made for me, of course.

233
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:52,441
Look. Even in Paris
you'll never see such a bullet.

234
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,522
I make them myself.

235
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:57,278
Silver? Afraid of werewolves?

236
00:26:59,118 --> 00:27:02,201
I like to sign my shots.

237
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,114
I'm a hunter, fronsac.
And it's cost me dearly.

238
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,289
How did it happen?

239
00:27:08,877 --> 00:27:13,211
I learned the hard way that one bullet
won't always suffice.

240
00:27:13,382 --> 00:27:17,716
And, sardis notwithstanding,
prayer won't cure gangrene.

241
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:21,466
- Did a bear injure you?
- A lion.

242
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:26,308
Yes, two years in the Navy,
I traveled a lot.

243
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,806
Do you know Africa?

244
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,560
My lords, my daughter caused all this.

245
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,476
Here. Punish her as you will.

246
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,401
Witch!

247
00:27:41,577 --> 00:27:43,238
She's a daughter of the devil!

248
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,246
- A demon's got her!
- She's ill. She's ill.

249
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:50,829
She's not possessed!

250
00:27:58,177 --> 00:27:59,587
Burn her!

251
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,008
She mustn't swallow her tongue.
She'd suffocate.

252
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,344
She's not possessed.

253
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
I know.

254
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:26,035
Naturalist, philosopher
and a bonesetter as well?

255
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,547
She didn't show. I won the bet.

256
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:50,061
Marquis.

257
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:04,232
And the natives?

258
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,656
Superstitious brutes, like here.

259
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,333
Indian hunters eat the hearts
of their pray, for strength.

260
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,751
Are they brutes then?

261
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,747
In Africa, it's their enemies' hearts.

262
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,757
My lord count, Jean-francois,

263
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,176
you must move east...

264
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,921
There you are.

265
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,933
Your mother will be worried.

266
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:35,346
She always is.
If I listened, I'd be in a convent.

267
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,766
I know you don't believe. A libertine.

268
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:41,856
- Not when I'm in love.
- You're in love?

269
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:50,444
Ridiculous. We've hardly met.

270
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:53,538
You thought I meant you?

271
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:04,045
She must learn to ride like a lady.

272
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,046
No harm in a little exercise.

273
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,473
- My father sees no evil.
- My son sees but that.

274
00:31:10,452 --> 00:31:12,534
People died... here.

275
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,370
How do you know?

276
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:18,539
I hear their cries.

277
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,621
Mani, stop it.

278
00:31:20,796 --> 00:31:24,539
He's right.
This was a templar stronghold.

279
00:31:25,384 --> 00:31:28,717
2b heretics were burned alive
in the chapel.

280
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,551
- Is he a seer?
- No need to be.

281
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,311
You need but look.

282
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:52,574
My brother and I played here.

283
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,906
Were you not afraid?

284
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,830
He protected me from ghosts.

285
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:15,650
- No taste for the hunt?
- That a crime here?

286
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,072
For Indians,
a portrait steals the soul.

287
00:33:22,584 --> 00:33:24,245
My soul, too, interests you?

288
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,377
On foot at a hunt!?

289
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,460
- My fault.
- I didn't ask you.

290
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,553
- What possessed you?
- It's only a wolf.

291
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:21,970
- If it were the beast?
- I don't think so.

292
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,899
Pray the beast is one of these wolves.

293
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,826
These won't devour anyone now.

294
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,738
Curious fellow.

295
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:47,832
- Where did you find him?
- New France.

296
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,919
Is he... an acadian?

297
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:55,006
An Indian. A mohawk iroquois.

298
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:58,009
An Indian? A real one?

299
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,919
He doesn't look it.

300
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:05,600
Come to St. alban tonight.
We'll have fun with your valet.

301
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,762
- He's not my valet.
- What then?

302
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,772
He's my brother.

303
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,288
Really! Mixing your blood

304
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,295
with that of a savage?

305
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,549
No savage shares one's hardship.

306
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,299
Mani saved me from the english
at trois rivieres.

307
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,301
I thought the savages were cannibals.

308
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:51,138
As you can see, sir,

309
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,398
mani is no animal.

310
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,154
Can you reproduce
with a woman of our race?

311
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:07,325
All women are the same color,
when candles blow out.

312
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,828
Yes, father, they even have wit.

313
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:14,161
Indians and whites have had children.

314
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:17,672
- We're one species.
- Don't speak too soon.

315
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:20,003
A little like the negro.

316
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,177
What say you, sardis?

317
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,424
Your “blood brother” is god's child.

318
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:29,263
- Baptized him?
- He hasn't asked.

319
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,849
You are a man of your times.

320
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,684
Mani has his beliefs.

321
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,026
At home, he was a sort of...
A sort of priest.

322
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:41,689
If they have priests, they're doomed.

323
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:43,857
What are these beliefs?

324
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,778
Each man has an animal spirit,
called a totem.

325
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,201
Amusing. How's it work?

326
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,035
Would you?

327
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:06,717
Never fear, it won't hurt.

328
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,903
A sort of stag.

329
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:23,564
What says my wife?

330
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:27,735
Am I a stag in every sense,
or only on an animal level?

331
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:32,576
And my dear Thomas. What's his... totem?

332
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,413
Worm. Bookworm probably.

333
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,095
Snake.

334
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:48,847
For Indians,
the snake embodies wisdom.

335
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,266
And our intendent?

336
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:57,608
Boar.

337
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,101
Lighten your spirit.

338
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:05,105
For these barbarians
the pig is perhaps nobility.

339
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,358
Who's next? Sardis?

340
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,118
And me?

341
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:19,207
What am I, a semi-lion?

342
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,629
Half an eagle?

343
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,293
Make me lizard,
that my arm may grow back.

344
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,302
Jean-francois, enough.

345
00:38:31,643 --> 00:38:34,055
What? Have I been gauche?

346
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,807
Let me be.

347
00:38:39,234 --> 00:38:41,145
Mademoiselle? Your turn?

348
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,313
Pardon me,
but I'm weary of your tricks.

349
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,325
I'll retire before you begin
juggling or dancing on a ball.

350
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:51,989
Good night.

351
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,675
It'll cheer you, fronsac.

352
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:19,096
It's the best house in mende.
You'll sleep better than at the inn.

353
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:37,031
They're all for you.
And the new girl is very...

354
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,121
Dear little Marquis.

355
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,793
Come.

356
00:40:27,592 --> 00:40:30,584
I'm expensive, grégoire de fronsac.

357
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:33,173
Do you know me?

358
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,013
From here, gévaudan seems tiny.

359
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,341
Italian?

360
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:42,012
Just passing through.

361
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,769
I have money.

362
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:49,944
It's not only a matter of money.

363
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,613
What then?

364
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:24,308
Who did that to you?

365
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,141
An iroquois arrow.

366
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,727
Not far from the heart.

367
00:41:31,656 --> 00:41:35,490
I may be... a lucky man.

368
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:38,822
And that?

369
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,739
A bear.

370
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:46,334
He didn't care much for me.

371
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,511
You haven't seen anything yet.

372
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:14,187
My business is dangerous.

373
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:17,865
Some men aren't so nice.

374
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:25,869
Something to remember me by.

375
00:42:30,131 --> 00:42:32,543
A scandal! In my house!

376
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:37,218
- Valentine!
- I don't lay with sorcerers.

377
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,221
- What?!
- Snakes on him. I saw them move.

378
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:42,716
Our reputation! You have to go.

379
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:46,553
It's nothing.
He's an Indian, not a sorcerer.

380
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:49,723
- Then no Indians!
- Delicate whores!

381
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:54,227
Come on, girls.
Who will go with our redskin?

382
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,397
I'll double the fee.

383
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:01,568
- I like his tattoos.
- That settles that.

384
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:05,822
So, a sorcerer are we?

385
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:56,706
Will you do my portrait?

386
00:43:57,552 --> 00:43:59,634
If you don't behave.

387
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:22,649
Weeks passed, and duhamel's men
couldn't find the beast.

388
00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:27,157
A third winter would be spent
under her reign.

389
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:31,829
Neither the snow,
nor our rifles, nor our dogs

390
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,664
could stop her.

391
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,090
Recall how god warned us

392
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:42,673
through the words of Moses.

393
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:46,339
“L shall come unto you like a bear

394
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,348
whose cubs are ravished.

395
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,187
“As a lion I shall devour
your children

396
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,439
“and spill their entrails.

397
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,606
“1 will set upon ye a fearsome beast

398
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:04,611
“to consume you and your flocks,
make your fields barren.”

399
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:17,711
How long, oh lord,
wouldst thou forsake us?

400
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:45,990
A candle for each victim.
Is this truly the age of reason?

401
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:01,755
Have mercy!

402
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,505
Forgive me.

403
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,761
Have mercy.

404
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,847
Bless me.

405
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16,604
What is it, my son?

406
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,433
God has punished me.
She snatched my children on mt. Mouchet.

407
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:23,774
I'm damned. We all are!

408
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:29,283
Gather your men. We must leave.

409
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,784
Alert mani. I'll catch you on the way!

410
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,208
Marianne!

411
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:48,295
The wolves' friend.

412
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:50,634
I have something for you.

413
00:46:57,064 --> 00:47:00,056
I want to see you. Alone.

414
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:07,648
In 10 days my mother's going in retreat
and my father to a cure.

415
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:09,156
10 days?

416
00:47:09,327 --> 00:47:11,318
I'm not as free as you.

417
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,323
The torch.

418
00:48:38,666 --> 00:48:40,156
Bring the torch!

419
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:47,584
The storm is rising.
The men are tired.

420
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:49,172
We'd best go home.

421
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:52,172
No. We must find the girl.

422
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,552
I found the child.

423
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,991
Captain, your web of traps

424
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:59,652
snare more peasants than wolves.

425
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:03,243
Your men have plundered
the population.

426
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:08,252
And since you began,
the wolf has taken 12 more lives.

427
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,501
She should never have escaped us.

428
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,755
How's that?

429
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,171
She should never have escaped us.

430
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:17,594
What say you, fronsac?

431
00:50:18,516 --> 00:50:20,928
What sort of wolf is this?

432
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:29,937
My only certainty
is that this is no wolf.

433
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,191
Wolves don't attack men,
or very rarely.

434
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:35,855
I saw it in new France.

435
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,025
Perhaps our wolves are different.

436
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:41,114
A rabid wolf will attack.

437
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,454
And dies within a fortnight.

438
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,866
For 2 years, the beast has run.

439
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:50,206
Her victims bear wounds

440
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:52,379
no wolf could inflict.

441
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:56,383
I've often found upon the body

442
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:58,294
a piece of this metal.

443
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,467
- So?
- So...

444
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:06,719
No animal has fangs of iron.

445
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:13,980
Then the beast is no animal? Fine.

446
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,315
How do we catch her?

447
00:51:16,657 --> 00:51:19,239
While we speculate, she kills.

448
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:24,241
Gentlemen, let us hear m. De fronsac,
with utmost attention.

449
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:28,077
So you say, sir,

450
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,243
this 1s no ordinary animal.

451
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,670
We all think so.

452
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:38,008
And for myself I'm pleased
you concede this is something...

453
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:39,926
Supernatural.

454
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,093
I concede nothing, father.
I have only doubts.

455
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,766
Anything to add?

456
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,512
No, gentlemen.

457
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,271
I've received this from Paris.

458
00:51:55,779 --> 00:52:00,864
Capt. Duhamel, his majesty,
informed of your ineffective efforts,

459
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,531
requests you be relieved.

460
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:09,032
You and your men
are to return to langogne at once.

461
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,123
Sir beauterne, master at arms,
is on his way.

462
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:16,630
His mandate is to kill
this ferocious wolf.

463
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:21,969
He alone is authorized to hunt
in the diocese.

464
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,887
Gentlemen...

465
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:39,566
Then I'm forgiven?

466
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,653
I was curious to know my totem.
Is that the word?

467
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,488
I would guess...

468
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,157
Mermaid.

469
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:52,495
Are you never serious?
I'll ask your redskin.

470
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,579
And the beast?
Have you spotted her?

471
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,165
Forbidden subject?

472
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:03,677
My absurd assumptions would
get me laughed out of king's garden.

473
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:08,515
If I said the beast
is flesh and iron mixed,

474
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:12,936
that it's possessed of reason
and may disappear at will,

475
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,520
what would you say?

476
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:17,684
Country air has affected your mind.

477
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,601
She's eluding me.

478
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:23,364
After three months,
you expect to have finished?

479
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,609
Should the beast have surrendered?

480
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:29,278
Perhaps she's afraid of you.

481
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,950
Am I so fearsome?

482
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,208
A hard-won victory is better savored.

483
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,792
Is it true you're going to Africa?

484
00:53:40,134 --> 00:53:43,797
For now it's but
a naturalist's winter dream.

485
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,463
And you?
Ever yearn for new horizons?

486
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,138
A lady has more duties
than yearnings.

487
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:55,145
Do you see sardis over there?

488
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,647
Watching over you?

489
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,980
Looking out for me.

490
00:54:01,155 --> 00:54:04,397
Alone with you,
god knows what could happen.

491
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:08,651
Let's go inside.
Our priest might catch cold.

492
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,584
Good evening, sir.

493
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,846
- You're in love.
- I don't know.

494
00:54:37,441 --> 00:54:40,353
- I do.
- The cards?

495
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,270
I've never needed them for you.

496
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:47,773
So... let's drink.

497
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:52,536
To mademoiselle de morangias.

498
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:57,200
- What?
- Her brother was here.

499
00:54:58,045 --> 00:54:59,706
You slept with him?

500
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,541
Him?
He can't stand to be touched.

501
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:08,131
He watches, he drinks.

502
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,049
Then he talks in his sleep
like all men.

503
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,725
Do I?

504
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,562
What do I say?

505
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:21,814
Again!”

506
00:55:27,741 --> 00:55:31,984
Know how florentine women
keep their husbands home?

507
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:38,082
Each morning, they give them

508
00:55:38,252 --> 00:55:40,584
a slow poison.

509
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,663
And every evening the antidote.
That way,

510
00:55:44,842 --> 00:55:49,427
when the husband sleeps away,
he has a very bad night.

511
00:55:51,265 --> 00:55:53,506
You needn't resort to that.

512
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,763
Anyway, we aren't married.

513
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:59,469
- I am gregoire de fronsac.
- Yes, buffon's envoy.

514
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,474
The naturalist embalmer.

515
00:58:01,645 --> 00:58:05,058
M. De beauterne is at the intendent's.
Come at 2.

516
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:49,602
His majesty asked my advice
about your report.

517
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,439
Complicated fables indeed!

518
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:57,948
I believe the beast is a wolf.

519
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:04,697
I shall go out for it tomorrow.
I would rather

520
00:59:04,875 --> 00:59:06,786
you didn't come.

521
00:59:10,047 --> 00:59:11,537
Why is that?

522
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,960
The king left this affair to me,

523
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:17,550
and to my sole discretion.

524
00:59:18,472 --> 00:59:21,635
I have no need of you to end it.

525
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:30,981
On the table, there's a letter
from buffon and our beloved king.

526
00:59:32,486 --> 00:59:36,320
I'm at his service,
but believe me this is not...

527
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:40,904
I've read your report. Trouble yourself
no longer with this beast.

528
00:59:41,078 --> 00:59:42,659
It's my affair.

529
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:46,165
You may go.

530
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,165
Come here.

531
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:12,241
A woman from lorciere,
coming from the fair, was attacked...

532
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:16,499
Near mt. Mouchet,
she vanished in the wood.

533
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:19,247
The beast attacked in St. alban.

534
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:23,422
God punished me for my sins.
My children perished at mt. Mouchet.

535
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:35,181
Ho more than I believe in...

536
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:43,613
The beast is ho animal.

537
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,615
No animal has iron fangs.

538
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:51,951
Sir, come at once.

539
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,705
I saw him!

540
01:01:57,130 --> 01:02:01,464
Dispensing poison
and saying satanic incantations!

541
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:04,877
God knows for how long!

542
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:17,897
Let him go.

543
01:02:20,403 --> 01:02:22,064
An Indian remedy, father.

544
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,730
Only our prayers may save her.

545
01:02:26,243 --> 01:02:28,074
But, she was...

546
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,485
A miracle.

547
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:33,827
What happened to your brother?

548
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,881
A man with the beast?

549
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,960
The lass is incoherent.

550
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,399
Yes, the beast is dead.

551
01:03:50,744 --> 01:03:53,076
No cure for 10 gut shots.

552
01:03:59,919 --> 01:04:03,252
We've brought your things.
Begin at once.

553
01:04:12,349 --> 01:04:14,510
- It's not the beast.
- To work.

554
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:16,174
Ridiculous!

555
01:04:16,353 --> 01:04:18,184
M. De beauterne is coming.

556
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:19,845
Watch your lip!

557
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:22,514
Hello. Leave us.

558
01:04:23,360 --> 01:04:26,193
Don't you like my beast?

559
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:30,026
What is this?
You know it's not the beast.

560
01:04:30,367 --> 01:04:32,779
Her jaw is twice as large.

561
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:35,443
You can fix that here.

562
01:04:35,622 --> 01:04:36,452
What?

563
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:39,535
Paris awaits. I have only this wolf.

564
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,041
So make me a beast.

565
01:04:42,545 --> 01:04:45,287
- To fool the king?
- No, fronsac.

566
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:48,290
I carry out his will.

567
01:04:48,635 --> 01:04:51,217
You'd be wise to do as much.

568
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,463
Is that a threat, sir?

569
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,557
At my age? Come now, you know me.

570
01:04:57,727 --> 01:05:00,719
You're too smart to need threats.

571
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:03,980
Do your duty,
the king will be grateful.

572
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,062
Otherwise, he'll be quite upset.

573
01:05:07,654 --> 01:05:10,896
You have what you need.
I'm counting on you.

574
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,731
Good-bye for now.

575
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,983
Good evening, sad knight.

576
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,826
Not pleased to return to Paris?

577
01:08:04,581 --> 01:08:08,073
The beast is dead. You should be glad.

578
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,826
Want to hear a secret?

579
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,912
I collect them!

580
01:08:15,425 --> 01:08:19,168
Beauterne killed a wolf.
He's an impostor.

581
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,003
I'm his accomplice.

582
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:25,256
Here...

583
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,679
Drink to our treachery.

584
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:07,636
You saw nothing.

585
01:09:28,331 --> 01:09:30,743
You are no longer welcome.

586
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,493
Tell mlle de morangias I'm here.

587
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:37,413
I said... - Talk of the devil!

588
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,003
My son and I
were just speaking of you.

589
01:09:41,594 --> 01:09:43,835
I'm here to see your daughter.

590
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:47,005
- Out of the question.
- I insist.

591
01:09:47,183 --> 01:09:48,593
Let him in, mother.

592
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,679
Careful, Jean-francois.

593
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:58,099
- You know what will happen.
- Leave us.

594
01:10:01,364 --> 01:10:04,026
Sir... marianne is sick.

595
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:08,363
I don't understand.

596
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:16,375
Yet, fronsac, you know
what is gnawing at her.

597
01:10:17,547 --> 01:10:18,547
Where is she?

598
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:23,041
Follow me.

599
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,888
How kind of you to visit me!

600
01:10:29,475 --> 01:10:31,636
Mademoiselle, what is going on?

601
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,639
I'm to return to Paris.

602
01:10:33,813 --> 01:10:36,805
- But if you say the word...
- Bon voyage!

603
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:42,901
I warned you, sir.

604
01:10:44,741 --> 01:10:48,404
You once gave me a gift.
Here are two in return...

605
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,485
For your collection.

606
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,742
I was warned about your kind.

607
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:02,835
My kind, mademoiselle, does not
condemn people without listening.

608
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,505
Whatever has happened, let me explain.

609
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:08,503
Do not trouble yourself.

610
01:11:09,766 --> 01:11:13,600
Sir, do not make this harder
than it already is.

611
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:19,601
Agree that you are no man
for my sister

612
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:22,354
and leave it at that, my friend.

613
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:25,441
She won't nurse you all her life!

614
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:35,284
Aren't you glad
to leave here in one piece?

615
01:11:36,209 --> 01:11:39,372
We used to flay men
for looking at her.

616
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:44,877
- Times change.
- Not everywhere, fronsac.

617
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:46,541
Not here they don't.

618
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,557
I'm sorry...

619
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,634
Will you hit me, too?

620
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,145
Farewell.

621
01:12:01,567 --> 01:12:03,899
No regrets.
He didn't deserve you.

622
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,488
On this historic day, thanks be

623
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:13,151
to sir gregoire de fronsac,
of king's garden.

624
01:12:13,663 --> 01:12:16,746
The beast's end is partly his.

625
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,330
But it is mostly
thanks to your majesty.

626
01:12:21,838 --> 01:12:23,829
Let that be known.

627
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:28,336
In your sole person
resides sovereign power.

628
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:34,172
Only a beast could ignore it.

629
01:12:34,684 --> 01:12:36,515
That beast is no more.

630
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,186
I have only little merit.

631
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:44,520
Your power bestowed upon me,
I merely needed to appear

632
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:47,777
and the beast laid down her arms.

633
01:12:56,455 --> 01:12:57,786
What is this?

634
01:12:57,957 --> 01:13:01,950
Beauterne's carried out his orders.
As we all should.

635
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,789
- What orders?
- Mine.

636
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:09,374
This is m. Mercier,

637
01:13:09,552 --> 01:13:13,386
special counsel to his majesty
for domestic matters.

638
01:13:14,056 --> 01:13:17,548
It was his idea
to send Antoine de beauterne.

639
01:13:18,311 --> 01:13:21,223
You're to thank
for this prompt victory?

640
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,560
Admirable scruples,
but it's for the greater good.

641
01:13:25,902 --> 01:13:27,642
Have you read this?

642
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:31,654
Not for sale, but you may keep it.

643
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:33,405
It was banned?

644
01:13:33,576 --> 01:13:36,409
A fable undermining the king.

645
01:13:36,579 --> 01:13:40,743
Any longer, we'd have had trouble.
People are so gullible.

646
01:13:41,083 --> 01:13:45,497
Better to lie
than let lies be spread?

647
01:13:46,839 --> 01:13:49,171
Truth 1s a complicated thing.

648
01:13:49,342 --> 01:13:52,084
One must govern by simplicity.

649
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:55,173
No more beast, no more problem.

650
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,922
- She'll go on killing.
- Without acclaim.

651
01:13:58,267 --> 01:14:00,007
That's what counts.

652
01:14:00,186 --> 01:14:04,520
I was forgetting.
His majesty is most thankful.

653
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:07,269
It's said you want to go to Africa.

654
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:11,186
In six months, a schooner
sets sail for Senegal.

655
01:14:12,114 --> 01:14:15,356
If you wish, you'll be aboard.

656
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:20,945
Of course, we'll never speak
of gévaudan again.

657
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:24,122
Well, fronsac...

658
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,744
Marianne de morangias?

659
01:17:53,586 --> 01:17:54,826
Madame...

660
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,753
I don't believe I know you.

661
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:03,092
You and I have a mutual friend.

662
01:18:04,930 --> 01:18:06,340
Why are you here?

663
01:18:06,849 --> 01:18:08,760
No need to hide your face.

664
01:18:09,602 --> 01:18:11,684
Your perfume is not that of a lady.

665
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:16,851
Grégoire de fronsac
only ever loved

666
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,026
one woman.

667
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:20,355
He calls you in his sleep.

668
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:23,191
He's going away

669
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:26,027
on a long journey.

670
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:27,949
I care not.

671
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:35,120
When next you see fronsac,
don't say you saw me

672
01:18:35,211 --> 01:18:38,044
or you will lose him for good.

673
01:18:50,559 --> 01:18:52,641
Who was that, my child?

674
01:18:53,812 --> 01:18:55,393
No one.

675
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:24,081
Put that in the hold, too.

676
01:19:25,844 --> 01:19:29,086
Put those in my cabin.
They're fragile.

677
01:19:30,015 --> 01:19:33,849
- Hello, sir.
- Marquis!

678
01:19:36,438 --> 01:19:37,928
What brings you?

679
01:19:39,108 --> 01:19:40,188
Bad news.

680
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,692
The crimes have begun again.

681
01:19:43,862 --> 01:19:45,693
The king won't send more men.

682
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:48,025
I can't even find volunteers.

683
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:51,192
I can't help you catch the beast.

684
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:54,282
Well, you're not the only one I need.

685
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,122
Mani found the girl.

686
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,872
Just one hunt!
You'll be back in a month.

687
01:20:01,046 --> 01:20:03,537
The king won't let us go back.

688
01:20:04,550 --> 01:20:06,882
- He won't know.
- You're wrong.

689
01:20:07,052 --> 01:20:09,714
Many sacrifices could be avoided.

690
01:20:10,889 --> 01:20:13,130
You won't change my mind.

691
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,894
- Want to bet?
- Last time, you lost.

692
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:23,316
It's a pity I need this
to persuade you.

693
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:26,898
It's from marianne.
Where's mani?

694
01:20:30,743 --> 01:20:32,904
Hey, my friend!

695
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,667
How are you?

696
01:20:45,341 --> 01:20:47,332
We're going hunting again.

697
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:49,257
We'll do it your way.

698
01:20:50,429 --> 01:20:52,340
Well, sir, good news?

699
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,847
The best possible news, Marquis!

700
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:06,688
In the gevaudan,
the crimes continued.

701
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:10,526
Officially, the beast was dead.

702
01:21:10,949 --> 01:21:15,113
What really happened
appears in no history book.

703
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,612
It was carefully hushed up.

704
01:21:22,127 --> 01:21:23,788
Is he welcoming us?

705
01:21:24,046 --> 01:21:26,207
He wants to help us.

706
01:21:29,301 --> 01:21:32,293
Go to the castle. I'll meet you there.

707
01:22:02,251 --> 01:22:03,582
What is it?

708
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:14,342
The roulier house?

709
01:22:14,847 --> 01:22:17,930
Straight on. Last in the village.

710
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,411
This is Jeanne,

711
01:23:23,999 --> 01:23:24,999
my nanny.

712
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:29,494
Pierre, fetch some wine.

713
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,347
I'm being watched.
They might know you're back.

714
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:49,013
I'll tear you away from your family.

715
01:24:03,789 --> 01:24:07,202
I can't bear my mother,
nor Jean-francois.

716
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:09,290
I want to leave.

717
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:11,627
In a week, we'll go to Paris.

718
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:13,458
Why wait?

719
01:24:13,966 --> 01:24:17,049
The hunt. I promised the Marquis.

720
01:24:17,219 --> 01:24:18,880
You didn't return for me?

721
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:47,748
Look out!

722
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,920
Leave! Slowly, don't run!

723
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,263
Over here! Look at me!

724
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:06,601
Come here!

725
01:25:24,036 --> 01:25:25,697
Go, marianne!

726
01:26:05,661 --> 01:26:07,401
What is this? Open up!

727
01:26:57,462 --> 01:27:00,954
Tell me, do you really think
we'll find this beast?

728
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,123
We're short of men.

729
01:27:03,385 --> 01:27:06,127
Mani's able. I'm hunting a man.

730
01:27:09,808 --> 01:27:10,808
A man?

731
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:15,219
The beast is a weapon
serving a sick mind.

732
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,722
- A killer works in secret.
- Quite.

733
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:21,729
The beast"s mystery is its fame.

734
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:26,405
Her master seeks fear and noise.

735
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:28,576
How's that?

736
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,235
This book is sold all over.

737
01:27:33,832 --> 01:27:37,825
It says the beast is punishing
the king's indulgence

738
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:39,409
in philosophers.

739
01:27:39,755 --> 01:27:40,755
Who wrote it?

740
01:27:41,256 --> 01:27:44,589
I don't know,
but the beast has a master. I want him.

741
01:28:05,447 --> 01:28:07,938
Perhaps your weapon will help.

742
01:28:08,950 --> 01:28:10,861
With you the carrier!

743
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,693
And you mani?

744
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:14,948
Which will you choose?

745
01:28:15,457 --> 01:28:17,448
Mani doesn't like firearms.

746
01:28:18,210 --> 01:28:22,123
Too much noise and smoke.
Bad smell.

747
01:28:43,985 --> 01:28:45,566
All will go well, grandfather.

748
01:28:48,156 --> 01:28:49,156
Don't worry.

749
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:50,817
We're well prepared.

750
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,951
Tell me of the americas.

751
01:31:10,799 --> 01:31:12,881
Will you never go back?

752
01:31:14,386 --> 01:31:17,219
- Not all my souvenirs are good.
- And mani?

753
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:19,136
Does he miss his tribe?

754
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,635
His tribe is no more.

755
01:31:22,310 --> 01:31:25,473
Before our attack,
the pox had decimated his village.

756
01:31:26,815 --> 01:31:29,978
Orders were to execute survivors.
The women,

757
01:31:30,151 --> 01:31:34,235
and the children, too.
Only mani escaped.

758
01:31:34,990 --> 01:31:36,150
How?

759
01:31:36,408 --> 01:31:38,399
We needed an interpreter.

760
01:31:38,994 --> 01:31:43,488
I was to teach him our language.
I found him slaying the captain.

761
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:46,156
Why not turn him in?

762
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:49,493
Know how the captain waged battle?

763
01:31:50,005 --> 01:31:53,668
He gave his scouts
infected hospital sheets.

764
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:59,177
The iroquois bought them.
Three weeks later, we'd mop up.

765
01:31:59,431 --> 01:32:03,595
- And that's our war?
- It was our defeat.

766
01:32:07,105 --> 01:32:08,686
Where did he go?

767
01:32:09,774 --> 01:32:12,356
- To speak to the trees.
- Trees?

768
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,108
Trees can speak.

769
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:20,365
The white man cannot listen or see.

770
01:32:21,119 --> 01:32:22,359
See what, mani?

771
01:32:29,210 --> 01:32:30,700
Want to learn?

772
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,794
- What's this?
- An Indian sacrament.

773
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:36,798
You're on your own, Marquis.

774
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:43,714
- What's it do?
- Depends on the person.

775
01:32:45,977 --> 01:32:48,218
They say they see the invisible.

776
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,315
Mani?

777
01:32:52,067 --> 01:32:55,480
The beast is in the forest.
The wolves will help us.

778
01:32:55,653 --> 01:32:56,813
I see no better.

779
01:32:57,072 --> 01:33:01,065
This night we shall dance
the dance of blood.

780
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:06,908
And the beast shall come to us
with the sun.

781
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:08,913
It has no effect on me.

782
01:33:15,423 --> 01:33:19,166
That night, mani invoked spirits
in a language

783
01:33:19,344 --> 01:33:22,586
even fronsac couldnt understand.

784
01:33:23,181 --> 01:33:26,264
And the wolves brought them the beast.

785
01:36:35,623 --> 01:36:38,786
Don't worry, I'll fix this for you.

786
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:09,540
Don't worry, girl. I'll see to you.

787
01:38:11,386 --> 01:38:14,048
I'll take care of you.

788
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:02,999
Thomas is asleep. A close call.

789
01:43:03,761 --> 01:43:06,002
I'm sorry for the Indian.

790
01:43:06,347 --> 01:43:07,427
What is there?

791
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:11,011
Tell me, what manor is this?
I need to know.

792
01:43:11,519 --> 01:43:14,682
It's a domain. A hunting ground.

793
01:43:17,942 --> 01:43:20,183
Sir, you need rest.

794
01:45:16,143 --> 01:45:17,633
Hurry! Fire!

795
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:31,891
He's over there. Come on!

796
01:49:56,090 --> 01:49:59,002
Fronsac returned to the Indian's side.

797
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:02,251
His revenge had hardly begun.

798
01:50:02,429 --> 01:50:04,260
But Indian custom

799
01:50:04,431 --> 01:50:09,266
required that, at dawn"s first light,
he be sent to his ancestors.

800
01:50:15,109 --> 01:50:16,599
What do you want?

801
01:50:17,611 --> 01:50:20,273
Too much blood has been spilled.

802
01:50:21,031 --> 01:50:23,113
You're in great peril here.

803
01:50:24,451 --> 01:50:26,783
I have business to attend.

804
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,282
Is it worth your life?

805
01:50:31,792 --> 01:50:33,373
How long have you known?

806
01:50:34,795 --> 01:50:36,535
I don't know what you mean.

807
01:50:36,713 --> 01:50:40,126
Come now, sardis. How?

808
01:50:40,801 --> 01:50:42,792
How did it get this far?

809
01:50:44,138 --> 01:50:46,379
No one will believe you.

810
01:50:48,725 --> 01:50:50,636
Go away, sardis.

811
01:50:52,646 --> 01:50:54,136
May god save you.

812
01:50:55,816 --> 01:50:58,057
May the devil take you.

813
01:51:19,173 --> 01:51:20,583
You're under arrest.

814
01:51:20,757 --> 01:51:23,840
By order of the intendent,

815
01:51:24,011 --> 01:51:26,002
please offer no resistance.

816
01:51:26,180 --> 01:51:28,011
That's ridiculous.

817
01:52:04,384 --> 01:52:07,217
- A lady to see you.
- Later. Tonight.

818
01:52:17,147 --> 01:52:20,560
- Get up. You've got company.
- Aren't I in solitary confinement?

819
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,065
Depends for whom.

820
01:52:33,664 --> 01:52:34,744
Sorry.

821
01:52:37,918 --> 01:52:40,159
Bring your guest some dinner.

822
01:52:43,257 --> 01:52:46,249
- How?
- Many owe me favors.

823
01:52:47,511 --> 01:52:50,093
Help me. I must write the king.

824
01:52:51,848 --> 01:52:54,931
You'd be hung
before he read your letter.

825
01:52:55,435 --> 01:52:57,426
I've yet to stand trial.

826
01:52:58,272 --> 01:52:59,352
Here.

827
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:09,605
- Tell me of the beast.
- A trained animal.

828
01:53:10,284 --> 01:53:12,775
Cloaked in armor. I wounded it.

829
01:53:16,623 --> 01:53:18,284
Why the sudden interest?

830
01:53:18,458 --> 01:53:19,458
Two years ago,

831
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:23,202
a confidential letter from sardis

832
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:24,961
was given to the pope.

833
01:53:25,215 --> 01:53:28,799
It spoke of a newly founded
secret society,

834
01:53:29,386 --> 01:53:31,547
whose purpose was to speak

835
01:53:32,639 --> 01:53:35,881
and defend, by any means,
the word of the church.

836
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:39,142
The “brotherhood.”

837
01:53:39,479 --> 01:53:43,313
Sardis. He was using the beast.

838
01:53:46,236 --> 01:53:47,316
The beast

839
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:50,567
is a warning to the king:

840
01:53:50,907 --> 01:53:54,820
“Heed the power of the lord
or suffer apocalypse.”

841
01:53:55,746 --> 01:53:59,159
Members are known
as “wolves of god.”

842
01:54:01,251 --> 01:54:03,333
It serves the church?

843
01:54:08,425 --> 01:54:10,837
Sardis serves only himself.

844
01:54:10,927 --> 01:54:13,259
This age has made him mad.

845
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:16,513
The group is beyond Rome's control.

846
01:54:21,188 --> 01:54:22,849
In whose employ are you?

847
01:54:22,939 --> 01:54:26,523
My duties include
never letting that be known.

848
01:54:34,701 --> 01:54:37,534
And you... you know quite enough.

849
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:51,047
Mlle de morangias, what an honor.

850
01:54:51,635 --> 01:54:55,219
How fares the countess?
Please sit down.

851
01:54:57,724 --> 01:55:00,056
And your father? Still in cure?

852
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:04,310
He's too fond of rich food.

853
01:55:05,482 --> 01:55:08,565
Sir, you've arrested fronsac.

854
01:55:10,070 --> 01:55:12,652
Such a man, how far he's fallen.

855
01:55:12,823 --> 01:55:15,565
- He's neither bandit nor murderer.
- Really?

856
01:55:16,743 --> 01:55:17,743
Listen,

857
01:55:18,412 --> 01:55:20,323
he must've had his reasons.

858
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:22,996
If they killed the Indian...

859
01:55:23,250 --> 01:55:24,660
That's another matter.

860
01:55:25,335 --> 01:55:30,250
You don't avenge a savage
with Christian blood.

861
01:55:32,592 --> 01:55:33,752
May I visit him?

862
01:55:45,272 --> 01:55:46,853
Impossible.

863
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:49,775
Very well.

864
01:55:50,944 --> 01:55:53,435
Paris shall hear of this.

865
01:55:53,613 --> 01:55:57,276
You don't understand.
Fronsac passed away.

866
01:55:58,452 --> 01:55:59,783
Last night.

867
01:56:13,383 --> 01:56:16,466
In any case they'd have hung him.

868
01:56:16,553 --> 01:56:19,386
Upon reflection, he was lucky.

869
01:56:20,474 --> 01:56:22,305
He was in your custody.

870
01:56:23,393 --> 01:56:24,883
Perhaps he choked.

871
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:27,720
Or caught a blight in the mattress.

872
01:56:28,315 --> 01:56:31,978
You're lying. You're all lying!

873
01:56:33,320 --> 01:56:35,982
Courage, it's the will of god.

874
01:56:40,327 --> 01:56:41,327
Come.

875
01:56:41,495 --> 01:56:45,079
- I'll escort you home.
- She needs rest.

876
01:56:48,919 --> 01:56:51,080
- Let me alone!
- It's over.

877
01:56:56,259 --> 01:57:00,844
He's already reeking.
Bury him quickly in an unmarked grave.

878
01:57:01,765 --> 01:57:04,848
She threatened to go to the king.

879
01:57:05,435 --> 01:57:07,346
That girl is dangerous.

880
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:15,442
Fronsac was buried that very night,

881
01:57:21,117 --> 01:57:24,951
No one knew what secrets
he took to his grave.

882
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,703
For several days,
the beast did not strike.

883
01:57:31,711 --> 01:57:35,454
But the sudden disappearance
of her most dauntless foe

884
01:57:35,632 --> 01:57:38,214
seemed of darkest portent.

885
01:57:59,906 --> 01:58:00,906
Hurry.

886
01:58:08,582 --> 01:58:11,915
Father, I'm guilty,
I have sinned.

887
01:58:12,419 --> 01:58:13,499
Forgive me...

888
01:58:15,171 --> 01:58:18,254
Marianne...
Day and night I think of her.

889
01:58:18,925 --> 01:58:22,167
I hear her heart beating in my chest.

890
01:58:23,263 --> 01:58:25,845
I want her on our side, sardis.

891
01:58:26,016 --> 01:58:28,098
The lord is testing you.

892
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:30,349
I can't endure it.

893
01:58:33,690 --> 01:58:35,100
The visions.

894
01:58:37,861 --> 01:58:41,194
These accursed visions torment me.

895
01:58:44,451 --> 01:58:47,443
Deliver me, father.

896
01:58:47,537 --> 01:58:49,869
I beg of you.

897
01:58:50,790 --> 01:58:53,532
There's only one remedy for this evil.

898
01:59:57,857 --> 01:59:59,688
Don't drink, sister.

899
02:00:01,861 --> 02:00:03,522
They want to kill you.

900
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:07,109
But I won't let them.

901
02:00:08,868 --> 02:00:10,699
Who does?

902
02:00:12,205 --> 02:00:13,285
Who?

903
02:00:15,291 --> 02:00:18,954
We're going to leave,
just you and me.

904
02:00:19,713 --> 02:00:21,874
How about America?

905
02:00:24,050 --> 02:00:26,712
You've hurt me, but I forgive you.

906
02:00:33,059 --> 02:00:34,970
Please. What are you doing?

907
02:00:37,147 --> 02:00:38,307
Stay.

908
02:00:43,319 --> 02:00:45,230
Would I harm you?

909
02:00:45,321 --> 02:00:47,653
Please stay away from me.

910
02:00:49,325 --> 02:00:51,407
Marianne, I need you.

911
02:00:52,078 --> 02:00:55,161
You saved me when I was sick,
no one else.

912
02:00:55,999 --> 02:00:58,661
Your face ended my nightmares.

913
02:00:58,918 --> 02:01:01,409
Your hand on my brow chased demons.

914
02:01:01,588 --> 02:01:03,920
You can't know all I've done
to keep you near.

915
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:07,582
I beg of you, don't shun me.

916
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:17,346
Why?

917
02:01:20,940 --> 02:01:22,601
Do I disgust you?

918
02:01:22,692 --> 02:01:25,604
You don't frighten me. Get out.

919
02:01:28,364 --> 02:01:30,355
Because of this?

920
02:01:35,622 --> 02:01:37,613
Never fear.

921
02:01:38,374 --> 02:01:41,286
From now on, I'll take care of you.

922
02:01:42,796 --> 02:01:43,796
Look.

923
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:49,299
No one knows. Only sardis and I.

924
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:06,816
Leavel get out!

925
02:02:08,738 --> 02:02:10,148
Why?

926
02:02:12,492 --> 02:02:14,323
You're not my brother.

927
02:02:15,411 --> 02:02:18,073
Another man returned from Africa.

928
02:02:18,248 --> 02:02:21,661
That's true,
but it was for you I left.

929
02:02:23,253 --> 02:02:25,665
But for you,
all this would not be.

930
02:02:26,256 --> 02:02:27,256
All this?

931
02:02:37,851 --> 02:02:42,766
It's your odor
that foul thing smelled on me.

932
02:02:44,941 --> 02:02:47,853
We're of the same blood, marianne.

933
02:02:54,367 --> 02:02:56,358
He'll kill you!

934
02:02:57,871 --> 02:03:01,784
Unless I kill him?
He's hindered us so long.

935
02:03:03,543 --> 02:03:07,035
Go ahead. Do it, go ahead.

936
02:03:30,820 --> 02:03:32,902
Why didn't you?

937
02:03:33,823 --> 02:03:35,905
Is it so difficult? Look.

938
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:38,066
- Stop.
- Then you love me?

939
02:03:45,418 --> 02:03:47,079
Marianne, I love you.

940
02:03:52,425 --> 02:03:55,838
Brothers, the lord has told me,

941
02:03:56,429 --> 02:03:58,420
the beast will be back

942
02:03:58,598 --> 02:04:02,591
to herald the return of values
to our decadent kingdom.

943
02:04:03,770 --> 02:04:05,931
And in a reborn France

944
02:04:06,606 --> 02:04:10,770
we shall be invisible princes,
for god is with us.

945
02:04:24,040 --> 02:04:26,952
The people cannot fathom
the lord's wrath.

946
02:04:27,543 --> 02:04:30,535
The unjust censure of the king

947
02:04:31,130 --> 02:04:34,463
cannot withstand the public's rage.

948
02:04:35,301 --> 02:04:38,213
When that wrath is at a climax,

949
02:04:38,388 --> 02:04:40,629
we'll bargain with the king.

950
02:04:40,890 --> 02:04:43,131
If he couldn't repress one,

951
02:04:43,643 --> 02:04:46,806
imagine if, from all over the realm,

952
02:04:46,980 --> 02:04:50,143
other beasts burst forth.

953
02:04:51,901 --> 02:04:55,564
The hour is at hand
to reap what we've sewn.

954
02:04:59,158 --> 02:05:01,820
Let us read from Malachi.

955
02:05:02,328 --> 02:05:06,742
“The word of the priest
is the depository of science,

956
02:05:07,166 --> 02:05:11,409
“and from his mouth is sought
knowledge of the law,

957
02:05:11,587 --> 02:05:15,000
“for he is the angel
of the lord of hosts...”

958
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:17,415
"He who adores the beast

959
02:05:19,178 --> 02:05:21,510
“shall drink the lord's wrath.

960
02:05:21,931 --> 02:05:25,344
“He shall be tormented
in the fire and brimstone

961
02:05:26,269 --> 02:05:27,850
“before the angels,

962
02:05:28,271 --> 02:05:32,435
“and the smoke shall rise
in the century of centuries.”

963
02:05:33,276 --> 02:05:35,267
I've come back to name you.

964
02:05:35,862 --> 02:05:39,354
Pierre-Jean laffont.
Genevieve de morangias.

965
02:05:39,866 --> 02:05:43,779
Maxime des foréts.
Gontrand de moncan.

966
02:05:43,953 --> 02:05:48,196
Henri sardis.
Jean-francois de morangias.

967
02:05:51,044 --> 02:05:52,044
Amen!

968
02:07:39,318 --> 02:07:40,318
Firel

969
02:07:51,247 --> 02:07:55,081
Bastards!
You're all under arrest!

970
02:08:45,718 --> 02:08:47,208
Ghost or no ghost,

971
02:08:49,555 --> 02:08:52,046
I'll split you in two.

972
02:09:03,736 --> 02:09:06,569
See? No need to hold back.

973
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:08,149
I never intended to.

974
02:09:08,407 --> 02:09:11,399
Too late. The beast is immortal now.

975
02:09:11,577 --> 02:09:13,818
Perhaps, but you are not!

976
02:10:05,464 --> 02:10:08,456
- You trained the beast.
- How'd you know?

977
02:10:09,218 --> 02:10:10,958
You use silver bullets.

978
02:11:08,444 --> 02:11:09,524
Look!

979
02:11:22,625 --> 02:11:24,786
Marianne's not here, madman.

980
02:11:25,711 --> 02:11:27,702
You've united us forever.

981
02:11:57,910 --> 02:11:59,571
Line the bastards up!

982
02:11:59,995 --> 02:12:01,235
Who are you?

983
02:12:03,582 --> 02:12:05,823
Look at them!

984
02:12:06,085 --> 02:12:08,326
Not so high and mighty now!

985
02:12:08,754 --> 02:12:09,754
Get back!

986
02:12:30,443 --> 02:12:33,276
- He's dead.
- Now it's certain.

987
02:12:35,114 --> 02:12:36,524
And sardis?

988
02:12:37,283 --> 02:12:39,615
Wherever he runs, we'll find him.

989
02:12:39,785 --> 02:12:43,027
Or the mountain will take him.

990
02:12:45,291 --> 02:12:47,953
Shall we celebrate properly?

991
02:12:48,627 --> 02:12:50,458
You've killed me once.

992
02:12:51,630 --> 02:12:53,791
The better to revive you.

993
02:12:55,551 --> 02:13:00,545
I could introduce you in Rome.
Would you come with me?

994
02:13:05,311 --> 02:13:06,972
Too late.

995
02:13:07,646 --> 02:13:11,980
I like you, fronsac.
You make me forget all my duties.

996
02:13:22,328 --> 02:13:25,570
Leave, before I change my mind.

997
02:14:58,757 --> 02:15:02,670
- Marquis, what is it?
- Marianne.

998
02:15:03,429 --> 02:15:06,762
I've had her brought home.
She's dying.

999
02:15:11,437 --> 02:15:14,929
Get out! Go away! All of you!

1000
02:15:28,954 --> 02:15:31,286
Marianne, wake up!

1001
02:15:36,629 --> 02:15:39,120
Marianne, forgive me.

1002
02:15:43,886 --> 02:15:45,126
I love you.

1003
02:17:13,392 --> 02:17:17,055
Years passed,
but grégoire de fronsac

1004
02:17:17,229 --> 02:17:20,721
and marianne de morangias
never left my memory.

1005
02:17:21,734 --> 02:17:25,647
The world that made the beast
is dying away

1006
02:17:26,739 --> 02:17:31,403
and I must hasten,
for my story, too, is ending.

1007
02:17:40,669 --> 02:17:45,504
I remember the chevalier and I
at Jean-francois's hideaway

1008
02:17:46,258 --> 02:17:49,421
where the beast awaited
her final hour.

1009
02:19:31,196 --> 02:19:34,859
The old healer told us all he knew.

1010
02:19:35,367 --> 02:19:39,201
Jean-francois brought
an animal back from Africa,

1011
02:19:39,371 --> 02:19:41,362
and it dropped a litter.

1012
02:19:41,707 --> 02:19:45,199
Only one cub was kept.
The strongest.

1013
02:19:46,044 --> 02:19:48,456
Patiently and cruelly,

1014
02:19:49,047 --> 02:19:52,460
he'd trained it,
made it ever meaner.

1015
02:20:02,728 --> 02:20:05,219
Thus died the beast of gevaudan.

1016
02:20:06,815 --> 02:20:09,557
And I, Thomas d'apcher,

1017
02:20:10,068 --> 02:20:13,560
am probably the last to know
the whole truth.

1018
02:20:47,856 --> 02:20:51,269
The chevalier invited me to Africa,

1019
02:20:51,610 --> 02:20:55,603
but my land needed rebuilding.
My duty was to my countrymen.

1020
02:20:57,532 --> 02:21:00,444
I've often thought
of grégoire and marianne

1021
02:21:00,619 --> 02:21:05,454
over the peaceful years
that brought me gently to old age.

1022
02:21:07,292 --> 02:21:09,954
I never saw them again,

1023
02:21:10,462 --> 02:21:15,297
but I like to think
they lived happily, far from here.

1024
02:22:52,230 --> 02:22:56,724
