1
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,662
My lord, time is short.
Leave now, I beg you.

2
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,432
You'll be arrested.

3
00:00:35,539 --> 00:00:37,233
Fetch some candles.

4
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:39,697
I'll be working late.

5
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:42,672
And my usual glass of wine.

6
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:49,247
This world had to change.

7
00:00:50,353 --> 00:00:53,617
But the Revolution is now
a terror sweeping the land,

8
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:57,216
and it's my turn to be swept aside.

9
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,031
Old prejudices make men blind,
drive them mad...

10
00:01:04,066 --> 00:01:08,025
devour their hearts
and turn them into beasts.

11
00:02:40,061 --> 00:02:42,552
In the year 1764,

12
00:02:42,864 --> 00:02:46,459
the Beast reached our soil
and made it its own.

13
00:02:47,134 --> 00:02:52,093
A year later, its fame had spread
beyond the borders of our province,

14
00:02:52,307 --> 00:02:56,710
and it seemed no mortal
would ever overcome it.

15
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,800
The Beast's assaults

16
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:03,308
slowly sank the region of Gévaudan
into darkness.

17
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,379
Who goes there?

18
00:05:49,548 --> 00:05:50,946
What's he done?

19
00:05:52,651 --> 00:05:54,311
- What?
- He's a thief.

20
00:05:57,455 --> 00:05:58,422
And her?

21
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:01,083
His daughter. Damned witch!

22
00:06:01,926 --> 00:06:04,588
I healed their horses. They owe me.

23
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,125
Don't listen. They're liars!

24
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,131
- Did he heal the horses?
- Yes.

25
00:06:22,113 --> 00:06:23,205
Go on your way!

26
00:06:47,371 --> 00:06:51,774
Welcome to the land of the Beast!
Beware of wolf traps!

27
00:06:54,845 --> 00:06:56,904
Sir Grégoire de Fronsac

28
00:06:57,148 --> 00:07:01,948
and the man they called Mani
were neither hunters nor soldiers.

29
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:07,149
A naturalist at the King's Garden,
Fronsac was a libertine

30
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,849
and a fine wit.

31
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,559
The man who shadowed him

32
00:07:11,862 --> 00:07:15,263
was a mysterious foreigner.

33
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,896
At nightfall, the travelers arrived
at the castle of Marquis d'Apcher,

34
00:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,798
their protector in Gévaudan
for the duration of their mission.

35
00:07:55,405 --> 00:08:00,364
Our people fear no ordinary wolf.
The Beast is different.

36
00:08:01,277 --> 00:08:04,541
It flees men
as if it knew to fear them,

37
00:08:04,647 --> 00:08:06,945
yet spares no woman or child.

38
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,949
Have you ever seen it?

39
00:08:09,852 --> 00:08:12,844
How do you know it's just one animal?

40
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,947
The survivors all say the same.

41
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:20,326
It's bigger than a wolf
and has no fear of firearms.

42
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,390
I understand your skepticism.

43
00:08:24,634 --> 00:08:28,000
I don't believe any more than you
in dragons.

44
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:30,731
I've had a report drawn up,

45
00:08:31,007 --> 00:08:34,874
a memoir of the Beast's crimes.

46
00:08:35,878 --> 00:08:37,675
Judge for yourself.

47
00:08:41,316 --> 00:08:44,547
You battled the English in New France?

48
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:48,979
Yes, I went to study animals and nature.

49
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,460
I returned with wounds
and a captain's rank.

50
00:08:55,964 --> 00:08:59,923
I've organized a hospital
for victims of the Beast,

51
00:09:00,035 --> 00:09:02,127
in an old priory.

52
00:09:03,472 --> 00:09:05,371
A woman from Lorcière.

53
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:09,209
The Beast attacked her
coming from the fair.

54
00:09:09,311 --> 00:09:13,974
Two men saved her, the Beast fled,
but it took half her face.

55
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:19,552
Tell me, how is M. Buffon?

56
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:22,183
And how fares Paris?

57
00:09:26,193 --> 00:09:28,820
And L'lngénu? Have you read it?

58
00:09:28,931 --> 00:09:32,161
It's a bit late to discuss philosophy.

59
00:09:32,266 --> 00:09:35,394
Quite right. Let's speak of theater.

60
00:09:35,503 --> 00:09:40,304
Do you know any actresses?
What's in the theater this winter?

61
00:09:40,876 --> 00:09:42,207
Put it there.

62
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:47,247
They are a gallant lot, it's said.
I've read some are free with their charms.

63
00:09:47,848 --> 00:09:49,144
Do tell me.

64
00:09:53,854 --> 00:09:56,321
Here, to satisfy your curiosity.

65
00:09:56,424 --> 00:10:01,225
The Mercure de France!
We only get the Courrier d'Avignon.

66
00:10:01,662 --> 00:10:04,528
- I'll show you the common room.
- He'll stay here.

67
00:10:04,632 --> 00:10:07,032
Very well. Good night, sir.

68
00:10:13,106 --> 00:10:15,973
It's not Versailles, but the wine's good.

69
00:11:17,604 --> 00:11:19,265
It's big as a cow.

70
00:11:23,076 --> 00:11:27,535
Jacques says he's seen many wolves.
It's no wolf.

71
00:11:27,647 --> 00:11:30,809
Its snout is longer,
its teeth are like knives.

72
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:43,288
- If not a wolf, what was it then?
- The Devil.

73
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:47,758
Chevalier, the Beast has struck
near St. Alban.

74
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:11,189
There.

75
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:14,416
There's no one there.

76
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,515
Halt!

77
00:12:16,962 --> 00:12:19,988
What are those bastards doing here?

78
00:12:20,265 --> 00:12:21,663
Good day, Captain.

79
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:26,633
Good day, Marquis. My respects.

80
00:12:27,172 --> 00:12:29,537
Beware. There are traps.

81
00:12:30,476 --> 00:12:34,742
Duhamel, Sir Grégoire de Fronsac
of the King's Gardens.

82
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:40,506
He'd like to examine her body,
with your permission, of course.

83
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,420
The one who brutalized my men?

84
00:12:44,756 --> 00:12:48,384
- Had I known you ordered-
- I did not.

85
00:12:49,261 --> 00:12:52,389
You did well, and I beg your pardon.

86
00:12:52,964 --> 00:12:56,626
They're soldiers trained for war,
not hunting.

87
00:12:57,836 --> 00:13:00,929
Careful, she's stuffed with poison.

88
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:13,180
What sort of gardener are you?

89
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:18,244
When the Beast is killed,
His Majesty wants it studied in Paris.

90
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:22,181
I'll keep it after it's captured.

91
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,254
I'm having a look.

92
00:13:27,331 --> 00:13:31,130
With that jaw,
it must weigh 500 pounds.

93
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:33,737
This time, I'll get it...

94
00:13:34,305 --> 00:13:36,205
before the snow.

95
00:13:36,541 --> 00:13:38,907
It can't get away.

96
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:41,136
- Ever seen it?
- Once.

97
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:45,740
Once, in my musket sight.
I wounded it, my word on it.

98
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:48,613
It collapsed, then at once revived.

99
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:52,882
We lost it near Mt. Mouchet,
vanished in the wood.

100
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,690
Did it look like this?

101
00:13:58,461 --> 00:14:02,557
It had a black stripe
and a spike on its back.

102
00:14:17,581 --> 00:14:22,540
My friends, this is the sketch artist,

103
00:14:23,086 --> 00:14:25,486
Sir Grégoire de Fronsac.

104
00:14:26,056 --> 00:14:29,184
A man of Providence indeed,
come from Paris to--

105
00:14:29,292 --> 00:14:30,452
sketch the Beast.

106
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,259
His Eminence, the Bishop de Mende,

107
00:14:34,497 --> 00:14:36,430
the Duke de Moncan,

108
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:39,001
the Count de Morangias,

109
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,693
and Madame the Countess.

110
00:14:42,004 --> 00:14:46,498
Their son, Jean-François,
who has also traveled.

111
00:14:48,678 --> 00:14:52,135
- A clever hand, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

112
00:14:56,453 --> 00:14:59,353
M. Laffont, our intendant.

113
00:15:00,056 --> 00:15:03,422
Father Henri Sardis of St. Alban's.

114
00:15:08,098 --> 00:15:12,227
Tell us, sir, is there talk
of the Beast in Paris?

115
00:15:12,901 --> 00:15:16,667
- They've written ballads.
- Prayers would do better!

116
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:19,503
Does Capt. Duhamel so need God?

117
00:15:19,742 --> 00:15:21,004
Don't we all?

118
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:25,178
Duhamel just dresses his men as women

119
00:15:25,282 --> 00:15:27,250
to bait the Beast.

120
00:15:27,683 --> 00:15:29,843
He's doing what he can.

121
00:15:29,985 --> 00:15:31,612
Such indulgence!

122
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,347
Duhamel is incompetent.

123
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:38,118
His hunts exhaust the people,
his ruffians devastate our land,

124
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,456
and the Beast roams free.

125
00:15:40,562 --> 00:15:45,055
If Duhamel is all I get
for paying my taxes to Paris,

126
00:15:45,534 --> 00:15:48,093
I'd rather give it to my valets.

127
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:52,406
- What do you say, sir?
- You're not obliged to reply.

128
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:56,068
His Lordship likes to argue,
but he's a good Christian.

129
00:15:56,178 --> 00:16:00,170
When you arrived,
this assembly was talking my ears off

130
00:16:00,282 --> 00:16:02,374
with God this and God that.

131
00:16:02,484 --> 00:16:06,010
It's said the Pope sent a spy to see

132
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:09,818
if the Beast is
a manifestation of the Devil.

133
00:16:34,215 --> 00:16:35,408
Pardon me.

134
00:16:43,659 --> 00:16:48,254
Marianne de Morangias.
A daunting task indeed.

135
00:16:48,529 --> 00:16:50,724
The most elusive quarry in our land.

136
00:16:51,065 --> 00:16:55,229
- Who's the hapless hunter?
- Des Forêts, a playwright.

137
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,130
- Then it's simple.
- Careful, she's a Morangias.

138
00:17:04,779 --> 00:17:06,838
Sir, we were conferring--

139
00:17:06,948 --> 00:17:09,006
- M. Des Forêts?
- Himself.

140
00:17:09,117 --> 00:17:12,517
An honor. Good writers are rare.

141
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:14,450
Marquis d'Apcher spoke of you.

142
00:17:15,056 --> 00:17:17,751
He thought of you for his memoirs.

143
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:18,826
Really?

144
00:17:18,926 --> 00:17:22,190
He's in good spirits.
But have some finesse.

145
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:26,163
Wait till he broaches the subject.

146
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,362
Excuse me.

147
00:17:30,204 --> 00:17:33,138
- Have you no shame?
- None.

148
00:17:34,274 --> 00:17:37,367
Does the naturalist like our country?

149
00:17:37,478 --> 00:17:41,937
I've only glimpsed its beauties so far,
or one of them.

150
00:17:43,216 --> 00:17:45,547
Is such the talk of court?

151
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:50,019
No, this is a couplet
reserved for provincials.

152
00:17:50,891 --> 00:17:54,884
I might go to court
if there were ladies like you.

153
00:17:56,463 --> 00:17:59,523
Dinner is served. Let's go in.

154
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:01,830
Whither thou goest...

155
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:09,074
In sailing up the St. Lawrence
we found in our nets

156
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:12,404
the strangest animal I'd ever seen.

157
00:18:13,013 --> 00:18:15,344
I'd heard of the native's sacred fish,

158
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:18,417
but I was sure it was a legend.

159
00:18:19,386 --> 00:18:21,683
I was looking at a fish

160
00:18:21,788 --> 00:18:25,087
the shape and size of a trout,

161
00:18:25,892 --> 00:18:30,851
but which was entirely covered
in a rich black fur.

162
00:18:32,398 --> 00:18:35,162
A furry trout? Surely you jest.

163
00:18:35,267 --> 00:18:36,325
No, sir.

164
00:18:49,849 --> 00:18:53,148
Salmo truta dermopilla from Canada.

165
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,847
It's as soft as mink.

166
00:19:01,894 --> 00:19:06,193
- Nature is extraordinary!
- The water must be cold!

167
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:09,660
This proves the impossible,
may be possible.

168
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:10,734
Well said.

169
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:14,234
It surely won you the King's favor.

170
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:16,500
I doubt he deserves it.

171
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:20,342
Though I do recognize
your comedic talent.

172
00:19:20,813 --> 00:19:23,304
Had I two hands, I'd applaud you.

173
00:19:25,918 --> 00:19:29,785
- Please pardon him.
- Your son is right.

174
00:19:30,689 --> 00:19:33,020
This animal doesn't exist.

175
00:19:33,526 --> 00:19:36,323
My taxidermist is a clever man.

176
00:19:36,829 --> 00:19:38,693
Please excuse the prank.

177
00:19:39,097 --> 00:19:43,090
Should this fable convince us
there is no Beast?

178
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,260
That we're all simpletons?

179
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:47,461
The moral of the fable

180
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:50,939
is that dragons and unicorns
only appear in fables.

181
00:19:51,277 --> 00:19:54,677
Lies appear true when dressed in Latin.

182
00:19:54,779 --> 00:19:58,647
Careful, sir. We may lose
all sense of what you're saying.

183
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,540
Indeed, are you a naturalist
or a philosopher?

184
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,622
Or worse, an actor!

185
00:20:04,722 --> 00:20:07,849
I believe the knight is,
above all, Parisian.

186
00:20:07,959 --> 00:20:11,621
Enough talk of the Beast.
After all, it only preys on peasants.

187
00:20:11,729 --> 00:20:14,755
How about a guessing game? Charades?

188
00:20:14,866 --> 00:20:19,632
I've just composed a lover's lament.
May I, Countess?

189
00:20:19,871 --> 00:20:22,806
- If it isn't licentious.
- Oh no.

190
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:25,338
It's very chaste and pure.

191
00:20:25,443 --> 00:20:28,036
It's an improvisation.

192
00:20:28,146 --> 00:20:31,172
It's called "Wolves Howl".

193
00:20:37,255 --> 00:20:41,748
"I went not warily
though I bore no malice, verily

194
00:20:42,359 --> 00:20:45,988
"Your sly eye caught my heart
in its prowl

195
00:20:46,363 --> 00:20:49,992
"I howl"

196
00:21:04,549 --> 00:21:06,413
Shall I see you soon?

197
00:21:06,516 --> 00:21:08,984
Have you other amazing animals to show me?

198
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:13,988
You seem set in your idea of me.
Allow me to change your mind.

199
00:21:14,091 --> 00:21:15,353
You may try.

200
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:19,226
- Coming to the hunt?
- Certainly.

201
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,062
I can't allow it. Too dangerous.

202
00:21:24,101 --> 00:21:27,365
Obedience is the first virtue
of well-bred girls.

203
00:21:27,471 --> 00:21:29,735
This young man is right.

204
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,704
That day in Gévaudan,

205
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:40,242
there was the greatest hunt
ever in France.

206
00:21:41,284 --> 00:21:45,276
The King offered 6,000 pounds bounty
for the Beast.

207
00:21:45,389 --> 00:21:48,619
Thousands of enlisted peasants,
swordsmen and soldiers

208
00:21:48,725 --> 00:21:52,422
were joined by everyhunter
and adventurer in the region.

209
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:57,897
For a few hours,
we forgot we were the hunted.

210
00:22:59,794 --> 00:23:04,093
You each have a map and a location.
Movements begin at 7:00.

211
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:05,166
Thank you.

212
00:23:05,267 --> 00:23:08,861
You might well thank us!
My people have better things to do.

213
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,734
Your generosity rivals your courage.

214
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,367
Enough! For your sake,
we'd better take it.

215
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,071
We shall, Your Lordship.

216
00:23:20,548 --> 00:23:22,412
What is this ruckus?

217
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:40,244
Fine weapon, isn't it?

218
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:43,508
I had it made in Mende after a campaign.

219
00:26:43,616 --> 00:26:46,277
Custom-made for me, of course.

220
00:26:49,021 --> 00:26:53,252
Look. Even in Paris
you'll never see such a bullet.

221
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,087
I make them myself.

222
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:57,718
Silver? Afraid of werewolves?

223
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:02,321
I like to sign my shots.

224
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,863
I'm a hunter, Fronsac.
And it has cost me dearly.

225
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:08,899
How did it happen?

226
00:27:09,341 --> 00:27:13,902
I learned the hard way
that one bullet won't always suffice.

227
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:18,914
And, Sardis not withstanding,
prayer won't cure gangrene.

228
00:27:19,317 --> 00:27:22,343
- Did a bear injure you?
- A lion.

229
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:27,154
Yes, two years in the Navy,
has taken me to many places.

230
00:27:27,258 --> 00:27:29,191
Do you know Africa?

231
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:33,029
My lords, my daughter caused all of this.

232
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:35,758
Here. Punish her as you will.

233
00:27:39,536 --> 00:27:41,059
Witch!

234
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:44,370
She's a daughter of the Devil!

235
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:48,576
- A demon has got her!
- She's ill!

236
00:27:48,913 --> 00:27:53,042
She's not possessed!

237
00:27:58,723 --> 00:28:00,155
Burn her!

238
00:28:04,361 --> 00:28:07,421
She mustn't swallow her tongue.
She'd suffocate.

239
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:12,930
- She's not possessed.
- I know.

240
00:28:22,712 --> 00:28:26,705
Naturalist, philosopher
and a healer as well?

241
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,088
She didn't show. I won the bet.

242
00:28:49,439 --> 00:28:50,666
Marquis.

243
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:04,313
And the natives?

244
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:09,290
Superstitious brutes, like here.

245
00:29:10,827 --> 00:29:15,355
Indian hunters eat the hearts
of their prey for strength.

246
00:29:15,465 --> 00:29:17,398
Are they brutes then?

247
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,799
In Africa, it's their enemies'
hearts they eat.

248
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:25,800
My lord the Count, Jean-François,
you must move east...

249
00:29:26,976 --> 00:29:28,374
There you are.

250
00:29:28,544 --> 00:29:31,274
Your mother will be worried.

251
00:29:31,614 --> 00:29:35,948
She always is.
If I listened, I'd be in a convent.

252
00:29:36,319 --> 00:29:39,446
I knew you didn't believe me.
You're a libertine.

253
00:29:39,555 --> 00:29:42,990
- Not when I'm in love.
- You're in love?

254
00:29:47,929 --> 00:29:51,091
Ridiculous! We've hardly met.

255
00:29:51,968 --> 00:29:54,061
You thought I was speaking of you?

256
00:30:01,511 --> 00:30:04,570
She must learn to ride like a lady.

257
00:30:05,515 --> 00:30:08,142
No harm in a little exercise.

258
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:14,948
- My father sees no evil.
- My son sees evil everywhere.

259
00:31:11,012 --> 00:31:13,172
People died here.

260
00:31:14,215 --> 00:31:15,738
How do you know?

261
00:31:17,518 --> 00:31:18,984
I hear their cries.

262
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:21,116
Mani, stop it.

263
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:25,054
He's right. This was a Templar stronghold.

264
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,192
Twenty-five heretics
were burned alive in the chapel.

265
00:31:30,497 --> 00:31:34,227
- Is he a seer?
- No need to be.

266
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:40,536
You just need to look.

267
00:31:50,651 --> 00:31:53,175
My brother and I played here.

268
00:31:53,754 --> 00:31:55,482
Were you not afraid?

269
00:31:57,056 --> 00:31:59,456
He said he would protect me from ghosts.

270
00:33:11,963 --> 00:33:16,024
- No taste for the hunt?
- Is that a crime here?

271
00:33:18,571 --> 00:33:21,869
The Indians say
a portrait steals the soul.

272
00:33:22,607 --> 00:33:24,734
My soul interests you as well?

273
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,879
On foot at a hunt?

274
00:34:09,988 --> 00:34:13,115
- My fault.
- I didn't ask you.

275
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:19,026
- What possessed you?
- It's only a wolf.

276
00:34:19,297 --> 00:34:22,925
- And if it were the Beast?
- I don't think so.

277
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:28,635
Thank you.

278
00:34:35,914 --> 00:34:39,111
Pray the Beast is one of these wolves.

279
00:34:39,216 --> 00:34:42,013
Atleast these won't harm anyone now.

280
00:34:43,687 --> 00:34:45,210
Curious fellow.

281
00:34:45,724 --> 00:34:48,419
- Where did you find him?
- New France.

282
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,126
Is he an Acadian?

283
00:34:52,563 --> 00:34:55,589
An lndian. A Mohawk Iroquois.

284
00:34:55,866 --> 00:35:00,394
An lndian? A real one?
He doesn't look it.

285
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:05,932
Come to St. Alban tonight.
We'll have fun with your valet.

286
00:35:06,043 --> 00:35:07,771
He's not my valet.

287
00:35:07,878 --> 00:35:10,642
- What then?
- He's my brother.

288
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:38,002
Really! Mixing your blood
with that of a savage?

289
00:35:39,276 --> 00:35:42,108
A man who shares one's hardship
is no savage.

290
00:35:42,713 --> 00:35:45,806
Mani saved me from the English
at Trois Rivières.

291
00:35:46,115 --> 00:35:48,879
I thought the savages were cannibals.

292
00:35:49,085 --> 00:35:53,283
As you can see, sir, Mani is no animal.

293
00:35:57,227 --> 00:36:00,993
Can you reproduce
with a woman of our race?

294
00:36:04,001 --> 00:36:08,232
All women are the same color
when candles blow out.

295
00:36:08,872 --> 00:36:11,305
Yes, Father, they even have wit.

296
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:14,338
Indians and whites have had children.

297
00:36:14,444 --> 00:36:16,673
We're one species.

298
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:20,544
Don't speak too soon.
It's a bit like the Negroes.

299
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:23,715
What say you, Sardis?

300
00:36:24,053 --> 00:36:26,987
Your blood brother is God's child.

301
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:29,825
- Has he been baptized?
- He hasn't asked.

302
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,155
You are a man of your times!

303
00:36:32,262 --> 00:36:34,252
Mani has his beliefs.

304
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:38,425
At home, he was a sort of priest.

305
00:36:39,034 --> 00:36:42,333
If they have priests, they're doomed.

306
00:36:42,438 --> 00:36:44,200
What are these beliefs?

307
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:48,333
Each man has an animal spirit,
called a totem.

308
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:50,707
Amusing. How does it work?

309
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:55,414
Would you?

310
00:37:04,928 --> 00:37:07,225
Never fear, it won't hurt.

311
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:20,267
Caribou. A sort of stag.

312
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:23,841
What says my wife?

313
00:37:23,946 --> 00:37:28,245
Am I a stag because of my horns
or because of something else?

314
00:37:28,984 --> 00:37:33,045
And my dear Thomas, what's his totem?

315
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,450
Worm. Bookworm probably.

316
00:37:44,566 --> 00:37:45,589
Snake.

317
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:49,327
For lndians, the snake embodies wisdom.

318
00:37:49,438 --> 00:37:50,870
Serpent wise.

319
00:37:51,173 --> 00:37:52,833
And our intendant?

320
00:37:57,211 --> 00:37:58,178
Boar.

321
00:38:00,148 --> 00:38:01,614
Lighten your spirit.

322
00:38:02,017 --> 00:38:06,112
Perhaps for these barbarians
the pig is nobility.

323
00:38:06,888 --> 00:38:08,684
Who's next? Sardis?

324
00:38:14,295 --> 00:38:15,489
And me?

325
00:38:16,598 --> 00:38:19,395
What am l, a semi-lion?

326
00:38:20,201 --> 00:38:21,724
Half an eagle?

327
00:38:23,104 --> 00:38:26,698
Make me a lizard,
so my arm may grow back.

328
00:38:26,874 --> 00:38:28,808
Jean-François, enough.

329
00:38:31,812 --> 00:38:34,303
What? Have I been gauche?

330
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:38,680
Let me be.

331
00:38:39,552 --> 00:38:41,985
Mademoiselle? Your turn?

332
00:38:43,657 --> 00:38:46,854
Pardon me,
but I'm weary of your tricks.

333
00:38:46,961 --> 00:38:51,193
I'll retire before you begin
juggling or dancing on a ball.

334
00:38:51,298 --> 00:38:52,730
Good night.

335
00:39:13,153 --> 00:39:15,178
It'll cheer you, Fronsac.

336
00:39:15,288 --> 00:39:20,248
It's the best house in Mende.
You'll sleep better than at an inn.

337
00:39:33,606 --> 00:39:37,507
They're all for you.
And the new girl is very...

338
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:41,676
Dear little Marquis.

339
00:39:42,082 --> 00:39:43,309
Come.

340
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:31,354
I'm expensive, Grégoire de Fronsac.

341
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:36,496
- Do you know me?
- In here, Gévaudan becomes very small.

342
00:40:37,402 --> 00:40:38,699
Italian?

343
00:40:40,439 --> 00:40:42,407
Just passing through.

344
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,201
I have money.

345
00:40:46,845 --> 00:40:50,440
It's not only a matter of money.

346
00:40:58,557 --> 00:41:00,114
What then?

347
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:28,040
- Who did that to you?
- An lroquois arrow.

348
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,178
Not far from the heart.

349
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:35,684
I may be a lucky man.

350
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,294
And that?

351
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:42,793
A bear.

352
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,059
He didn't care much for me.

353
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:58,173
You haven't seen anything yet.

354
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:14,826
My business is dangerous.

355
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,292
Some men aren't so nice.

356
00:42:23,441 --> 00:42:26,068
Something to remember me by.

357
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:33,138
A scandal! ln my house!

358
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,786
- Valentine!
- I don't lay with sorcerers!

359
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,754
- What?
- Snakes on him! I saw them move!

360
00:42:40,857 --> 00:42:43,325
Our reputation! You have to go!

361
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:46,919
It's nothing.
He's an lndian, not a sorcerer.

362
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:50,329
- Then no lndians!
- You have delicate whores.

363
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:54,627
Come on, girls.
Who will go with our redskin?

364
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,435
I'll double the fee.

365
00:42:57,774 --> 00:43:01,835
- I like his tattoos.
- That settles that.

366
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:05,943
So, a sorcerer are we?

367
00:43:55,397 --> 00:43:57,297
Will you do my portrait?

368
00:43:57,967 --> 00:43:59,797
If you don't behave.

369
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:22,717
Weekspassed, and Duhamel's men
couldn't find the Beast.

370
00:44:24,093 --> 00:44:27,653
A third winter would be spent
underits reign.

371
00:44:28,162 --> 00:44:33,121
The snow could not stop it
anymore than ourrifles and dogs.

372
00:44:38,273 --> 00:44:42,676
Recall how God warned us
through the words of Moses:

373
00:44:44,146 --> 00:44:48,445
"I shall come unto you like a bear
whose cubs are ravished.

374
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:54,946
"As a lion I shall devour your children
and spill their entrails.

375
00:44:56,257 --> 00:44:59,021
"I will set upon ye a fearsome Beast

376
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:02,119
"to consume you and your flocks,

377
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:04,892
"and make your fields barren."

378
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:18,201
How long, O Lord, wouldst Thou forsake us?

379
00:45:41,702 --> 00:45:46,661
A candle for each victim.
Is this truly the Age of Reason?

380
00:46:00,554 --> 00:46:02,181
Have mercy!

381
00:46:04,458 --> 00:46:05,754
Forgive me!

382
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,022
Have mercy!

383
00:46:09,931 --> 00:46:11,363
Bless me!

384
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:17,296
What is it, my son?

385
00:46:17,404 --> 00:46:20,965
God has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!

386
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:24,142
I'm damned! We all are!

387
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,946
Gather your men. We must leave.

388
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:38,319
Alert Mani. I'll find you on the way!

389
00:46:46,733 --> 00:46:48,701
Hello, friend of the wolves.

390
00:46:48,902 --> 00:46:51,166
I have something for you.

391
00:46:57,310 --> 00:47:00,609
I want to see you. Alone.

392
00:47:03,716 --> 00:47:08,176
In 10 days my mother's going to a retreat
and my father to a cure.

393
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:11,744
- Ten days?
- I'm not as free as you.

394
00:48:36,608 --> 00:48:37,870
The torch.

395
00:48:39,043 --> 00:48:40,566
Bring the torch!

396
00:48:45,483 --> 00:48:48,110
The storm is rising; the men are tired.

397
00:48:48,386 --> 00:48:49,751
We'd best go home.

398
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:52,920
No. We must find the girl.

399
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:35,791
I found the child.

400
00:49:54,551 --> 00:49:59,510
Captain, your web of traps
snares more peasants than wolves,

401
00:50:00,324 --> 00:50:03,657
your men have plundered the population,

402
00:50:04,294 --> 00:50:08,627
and since you began,
the wolf has taken 12 more lives.

403
00:50:09,032 --> 00:50:12,023
It should never have escaped us.

404
00:50:12,135 --> 00:50:13,294
How's that?

405
00:50:13,403 --> 00:50:16,371
It should never have escaped us.

406
00:50:16,472 --> 00:50:18,166
What say you, Fronsac?

407
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:21,503
What sort of wolf is this?

408
00:50:26,816 --> 00:50:30,616
My only certainty is that this is no wolf.

409
00:50:31,455 --> 00:50:36,414
Wolves don't attack men, or very rarely.
I studied them in New France.

410
00:50:36,525 --> 00:50:39,460
Perhaps our wolves are different.

411
00:50:39,563 --> 00:50:41,689
A rabid wolf will attack.

412
00:50:42,231 --> 00:50:44,791
And dies within a fortnight.

413
00:50:44,901 --> 00:50:47,800
For two years,
the Beast has had its bloody reign.

414
00:50:48,404 --> 00:50:51,930
Its victims bear wounds
no wolf could inflict.

415
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:56,877
I've often found upon the body

416
00:50:56,979 --> 00:50:59,037
a piece of this metal.

417
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:02,039
- So?
- So...

418
00:51:04,487 --> 00:51:07,250
no animal has fangs of iron.

419
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,486
Then the Beast is not an animal? Fine.

420
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,897
How do we catch it?

421
00:51:16,998 --> 00:51:19,762
While we speculate,
it's killing our people.

422
00:51:20,236 --> 00:51:24,764
Gentlemen, let us hear M. de Fronsac
with utmost attention.

423
00:51:26,441 --> 00:51:28,601
So you say, sir,

424
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:31,646
this is no ordinary animal.

425
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:33,937
We all think so.

426
00:51:34,316 --> 00:51:37,513
And for myself I'm pleased you concede

427
00:51:37,619 --> 00:51:40,588
this is something supernatural.

428
00:51:40,689 --> 00:51:44,556
I concede nothing, Father.
I have only doubts.

429
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:47,523
Anything to add?

430
00:51:48,798 --> 00:51:50,196
No, gentlemen.

431
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,899
I've received this from Paris.

432
00:51:56,070 --> 00:52:01,006
Capt. Duhamel His Majesty has been
informed of your ineffective efforts.

433
00:52:02,076 --> 00:52:05,169
He requests you be
relieved of your duties.

434
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,641
You and your men
are to return to Langogne at once.

435
00:52:10,351 --> 00:52:13,615
Sir Beauterne, Master at Arms,
is on his way.

436
00:52:13,721 --> 00:52:17,247
His mandate is to kill
this ferocious wolf.

437
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:22,686
He alone is authorized to hunt
in the diocese.

438
00:52:24,165 --> 00:52:25,495
Gentlemen.

439
00:52:38,011 --> 00:52:39,808
Then I'm forgiven?

440
00:52:40,247 --> 00:52:44,080
I was curious to know my "totem".
Is that the word?

441
00:52:44,184 --> 00:52:45,742
I would guess...

442
00:52:47,121 --> 00:52:48,348
mermaid.

443
00:52:48,922 --> 00:52:52,619
Are you never serious?
I'll ask your redskin.

444
00:52:53,894 --> 00:52:56,760
And the Beast? Have you spotted it?

445
00:52:58,065 --> 00:52:59,555
Forbidden subject?

446
00:52:59,666 --> 00:53:04,126
My absurd assumptions would
get me laughed out of King's Garden.

447
00:53:04,805 --> 00:53:08,798
If I said the Beast
is flesh and iron mixed,

448
00:53:09,276 --> 00:53:13,644
that it's possessed of reason
and may disappear at will,

449
00:53:13,747 --> 00:53:15,078
what would you say?

450
00:53:15,182 --> 00:53:18,015
Country air has affected your mind.

451
00:53:18,118 --> 00:53:19,779
It's eluding me.

452
00:53:20,153 --> 00:53:23,986
After three months,
you expect to have finished?

453
00:53:24,090 --> 00:53:29,050
Should the Beast have surrendered?
Perhaps it's afraid of you.

454
00:53:29,663 --> 00:53:31,323
Am I so fearsome?

455
00:53:31,431 --> 00:53:34,729
A hard-won victory will be better savored.

456
00:53:37,204 --> 00:53:40,138
Is it true you're going to Africa?

457
00:53:40,474 --> 00:53:44,170
For now it's but
a naturalist's winter dream.

458
00:53:44,278 --> 00:53:47,542
And you? Ever yearn for new horizons?

459
00:53:49,449 --> 00:53:52,849
A lady has more duties than yearnings.

460
00:53:52,952 --> 00:53:55,545
Do you see Sardis over there?

461
00:53:56,456 --> 00:53:58,082
Are you being watched?

462
00:53:59,458 --> 00:54:01,187
He's there to protect me.

463
00:54:01,295 --> 00:54:04,991
Alone with you,
God knows what could happen.

464
00:54:05,464 --> 00:54:09,456
Let's go inside.
Our priest might catch cold.

465
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:21,873
Good evening, sir.

466
00:54:34,427 --> 00:54:37,452
- You're in love.
- I don't know.

467
00:54:37,964 --> 00:54:39,453
I do.

468
00:54:40,031 --> 00:54:41,328
The cards?

469
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:44,564
I've never needed them for you.

470
00:54:46,138 --> 00:54:48,128
So let's drink.

471
00:54:49,941 --> 00:54:52,535
To Mademoiselle de Morangias.

472
00:54:53,878 --> 00:54:57,279
- What?
- Her brother was here.

473
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,314
You slept with him?

474
00:55:02,187 --> 00:55:05,122
Him? He can't stand to be touched.

475
00:55:06,658 --> 00:55:09,218
He watches, he drinks,

476
00:55:09,628 --> 00:55:13,461
then he talks in his sleep, like all men.

477
00:55:14,566 --> 00:55:16,033
Do l?

478
00:55:17,669 --> 00:55:19,260
What do I say?

479
00:55:20,139 --> 00:55:21,662
"Again!"

480
00:55:28,346 --> 00:55:32,577
Know how Florentine women
keep their husbands home?

481
00:55:35,687 --> 00:55:38,417
Each morning, they give them

482
00:55:38,657 --> 00:55:41,148
a slow poison,

483
00:55:41,726 --> 00:55:43,956
and every evening the antidote.

484
00:55:44,062 --> 00:55:47,520
That way, when the husband sleeps away

485
00:55:47,632 --> 00:55:49,827
he has a very bad night.

486
00:55:51,636 --> 00:55:53,967
You needn't resort to that.

487
00:55:58,476 --> 00:56:01,171
Anyway, we aren't married.

488
00:57:27,363 --> 00:57:31,823
Make way for Antoine de Beauterne,
Royal Master at Arms,

489
00:57:31,934 --> 00:57:35,494
who has come to rid the country
of the Beast!

490
00:57:55,858 --> 00:57:59,987
- I am Grégoire de Fronsac.
- Yes, Buffon's envoy.

491
00:58:00,096 --> 00:58:01,927
The naturalist embalmer.

492
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:06,126
M. de Beauterne is at the lntendant's.
Come at 2:00.

493
00:58:46,074 --> 00:58:50,067
His Majesty asked my advice
about your report.

494
00:58:51,146 --> 00:58:53,477
Complicated fables indeed!

495
00:58:54,749 --> 00:58:57,944
I believe the Beast is a wolf.

496
00:59:01,089 --> 00:59:04,114
I shall go out for it tomorrow.

497
00:59:04,226 --> 00:59:07,092
I would rather you didn't come.

498
00:59:10,465 --> 00:59:11,830
Why is that?

499
00:59:13,368 --> 00:59:18,031
The King left this affair to me,
and to my sole discretion.

500
00:59:18,907 --> 00:59:21,704
I have no need of you to end it.

501
00:59:26,181 --> 00:59:31,083
On the table there's a letter
from Buffon and our beloved king.

502
00:59:32,953 --> 00:59:36,854
I'm at his service,
but believe me this is not--

503
00:59:36,957 --> 00:59:41,417
I've read your report. Trouble yourself
no longer with this Beast.

504
00:59:41,528 --> 00:59:43,155
It's my affair.

505
00:59:45,266 --> 00:59:46,562
You may go.

506
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:53,931
Come here.

507
01:01:08,948 --> 01:01:12,849
A woman from Lorcière.
It attacked her coming from the fair.

508
01:01:12,952 --> 01:01:16,854
We lostitnear Mt. Mouchet,
vanished in the wood.

509
01:01:17,156 --> 01:01:19,783
The Beasthas struck near St. Alban.

510
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:24,851
God haspunished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!

511
01:01:32,705 --> 01:01:34,969
I don'tbelieve anymore than you in...

512
01:01:35,073 --> 01:01:38,531
Its snoutis longer,
its teeth are like knives.

513
01:01:39,245 --> 01:01:42,008
My only certaintyis that this is no wolf.

514
01:01:42,115 --> 01:01:45,174
- The Beastis no animal.
- A rabid wolf will attack.

515
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,114
How do we catch it?

516
01:01:47,887 --> 01:01:49,980
No animal has iron fangs.

517
01:01:50,355 --> 01:01:52,414
Sir, come at once!

518
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,626
I saw him!

519
01:01:57,562 --> 01:02:02,124
He was dispensing poison
and saying satanic incantations!

520
01:02:02,968 --> 01:02:05,334
God only knows for how long!

521
01:02:17,149 --> 01:02:18,411
Let him go.

522
01:02:20,619 --> 01:02:22,587
An lndian remedy, Father.

523
01:02:22,687 --> 01:02:25,280
Only our prayers may save her.

524
01:02:26,591 --> 01:02:28,491
But she was...

525
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:30,456
A miracle!

526
01:02:30,996 --> 01:02:33,793
What happened to your brother?

527
01:03:23,447 --> 01:03:27,906
- A man with the Beast?
- The child is incoherent.

528
01:03:48,872 --> 01:03:50,897
Yes, the Beast is dead.

529
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:53,505
No cure for 10 shots in the gut.

530
01:04:00,284 --> 01:04:03,844
We've brought your things. Begin at once.

531
01:04:12,530 --> 01:04:15,293
- It's not the Beast.
- Get to work!

532
01:04:15,398 --> 01:04:18,799
- Ridiculous!
- M. de Beauterne is coming.

533
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:20,494
Watch your lip!

534
01:04:20,603 --> 01:04:22,730
Hello. Leave us!

535
01:04:23,907 --> 01:04:26,431
Don't you like my Beast?

536
01:04:26,809 --> 01:04:30,904
What is this? You know it's not the Beast.

537
01:04:31,015 --> 01:04:33,482
Its jaw is twice as large.

538
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:35,881
You can fix that here.

539
01:04:36,085 --> 01:04:37,052
What?

540
01:04:37,153 --> 01:04:42,055
Paris awaits. I have only this wolf.
So make me a Beast.

541
01:04:42,792 --> 01:04:45,727
- To fool the King?
- No, Fronsac.

542
01:04:46,462 --> 01:04:51,125
I carry out his will.
You'd be wise to do the same.

543
01:04:52,902 --> 01:04:54,927
Is that a threat, sir?

544
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:58,039
At my age? Come now, you know me.

545
01:04:58,141 --> 01:05:01,075
You're too smart for threats.

546
01:05:01,411 --> 01:05:04,811
Do your duty, the King will be grateful.

547
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:07,939
Otherwise, he'll be quite upset.

548
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:11,718
You have what you need.
I'm counting on you.

549
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,684
Good-bye for now.

550
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:55,827
On this historic day,
thanks be to Sir Grégoire de Fronsac

551
01:07:55,937 --> 01:07:57,631
ofKing's Garden.

552
01:07:57,759 --> 01:08:00,727
The Beast's end ispartlyhis.

553
01:08:02,304 --> 01:08:05,739
But it is mostly thanks to Your Majesty.

554
01:08:06,006 --> 01:08:07,633
Let it be known :

555
01:08:08,742 --> 01:08:12,472
In your sole person
resides sovereign power.

556
01:08:15,983 --> 01:08:18,507
Only a beast could ignore it.

557
01:08:18,619 --> 01:08:20,677
That Beast is no more.

558
01:08:21,155 --> 01:08:23,885
I have only little merit.

559
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:28,892
With your power bestowed upon me,
I merely needed to appear,

560
01:08:29,095 --> 01:08:32,189
and the Beast laid down its arms.

561
01:08:40,608 --> 01:08:42,166
What is this?

562
01:08:42,275 --> 01:08:46,336
Beauterne's carried out his orders,
as we all should.

563
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:48,471
- What orders?
- Mine.

564
01:08:50,517 --> 01:08:53,212
This is M. Mercier,

565
01:08:53,653 --> 01:08:57,589
Special Counsel to His Majesty
for domestic matters.

566
01:08:58,124 --> 01:09:01,753
It was his idea
to send Antoine de Beauterne.

567
01:09:02,428 --> 01:09:05,521
You're to thank for this prompt victory?

568
01:09:05,632 --> 01:09:08,931
I admire your scruples,
but it's for the greater good.

569
01:09:09,702 --> 01:09:11,067
Have you read this?

570
01:09:12,805 --> 01:09:15,933
It's no longer for sale,
but you may keep it.

571
01:09:16,542 --> 01:09:17,702
It was banned?

572
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:20,437
A fable undermining the King.

573
01:09:20,647 --> 01:09:24,912
We'd have had trouble if we waited longer.
People are so gullible.

574
01:09:25,218 --> 01:09:29,813
Better to lie than let lies be spread?

575
01:09:30,924 --> 01:09:35,883
Truth is a complicated thing.
One must govern with simplicity.

576
01:09:36,362 --> 01:09:39,125
No more Beast, no more problem.

577
01:09:39,399 --> 01:09:40,626
It'll go on killing.

578
01:09:40,733 --> 01:09:44,361
No one will hear of it again.
That's what counts.

579
01:09:44,470 --> 01:09:48,701
I was forgetting.
His Majesty is most thankful.

580
01:09:48,807 --> 01:09:51,604
It's said you want to go to Africa.

581
01:09:51,711 --> 01:09:55,306
In six months,
a schooner sets sail for Senegal.

582
01:09:56,316 --> 01:09:59,409
If you wish, you'll be aboard.

583
01:10:01,354 --> 01:10:05,050
Of course, we'll never speak
of Gévaudan again.

584
01:10:06,625 --> 01:10:08,148
Well, Fronsac?

585
01:13:18,959 --> 01:13:22,121
In Gévaudan, the crimes continued,

586
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:27,906
but officially, the Beast was dead.

587
01:13:35,988 --> 01:13:38,013
Is he welcoming us?

588
01:13:38,124 --> 01:13:40,114
He wants to help us.

589
01:13:43,368 --> 01:13:46,632
Go to the castle. I'll meet you there.

590
01:13:54,000 --> 01:13:59,000
Whatreallyhappened appears in no historybook.It was carefullykept quiet.

591
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:17,818
What is it?

592
01:14:26,716 --> 01:14:29,149
Where do Jeanne and Pierre Roulier live?

593
01:14:29,177 --> 01:14:32,543
Go straight on.
It's the last house in the village.

594
01:15:36,142 --> 01:15:39,304
This is Jeanne, my nanny.

595
01:15:41,814 --> 01:15:43,974
Pierre, fetch some wine.

596
01:15:57,897 --> 01:16:00,923
I'm being watched.
They might know you're back.

597
01:16:01,033 --> 01:16:03,627
I'll tear you away from your family.

598
01:16:18,150 --> 01:16:21,642
I can't bear my mother, nor Jean-François.

599
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:23,478
I want to leave.

600
01:16:23,956 --> 01:16:26,185
In a week, we'll go to Paris.

601
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:27,588
Why wait?

602
01:16:28,327 --> 01:16:31,420
The hunt. I promised the Marquis.

603
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:33,497
You didn't return for me?

604
01:17:00,925 --> 01:17:02,152
Look out!

605
01:17:14,205 --> 01:17:17,264
Leave! Slowly, don't run!

606
01:17:18,109 --> 01:17:19,838
Over here! Look at me!

607
01:17:19,943 --> 01:17:21,968
Come here!

608
01:17:38,296 --> 01:17:39,262
Go, Marianne!

609
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,927
What is this? Open up!

610
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:26,842
My God!

611
01:19:11,554 --> 01:19:15,490
Tell me, do you really think
we'll find this Beast?

612
01:19:15,591 --> 01:19:17,616
We're short of men.

613
01:19:17,727 --> 01:19:20,662
Mani knows what he's doing.
I'm hunting a man.

614
01:19:24,200 --> 01:19:25,325
A man?

615
01:19:26,068 --> 01:19:29,730
The Beast is a weapon serving a sick mind.

616
01:19:30,539 --> 01:19:33,200
- Wouldn't a killer be secretive?
- Right.

617
01:19:33,342 --> 01:19:36,174
The Beast's first mystery is its fame.

618
01:19:37,813 --> 01:19:41,680
Its master wants people to talk,
to be afraid and make noise.

619
01:19:41,784 --> 01:19:42,909
How's that?

620
01:19:43,419 --> 01:19:45,046
This book is sold all over.

621
01:19:48,090 --> 01:19:53,026
It says the Beast is punishing
the King's indulgence in philosophers.

622
01:19:54,163 --> 01:19:55,754
Who wrote it?

623
01:19:55,864 --> 01:19:59,027
I don't know,
but the Beast has a master. I want him.

624
01:20:19,822 --> 01:20:22,585
Perhaps your weapon will help...

625
01:20:23,158 --> 01:20:25,058
but only in your hands!

626
01:20:25,727 --> 01:20:27,160
And you, Mani?

627
01:20:27,796 --> 01:20:29,457
Which will you choose?

628
01:20:29,831 --> 01:20:32,129
Mani doesn't like firearms.

629
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:36,536
Too much noise and smoke. Bad smell.

630
01:20:58,059 --> 01:21:00,686
All will go well, Grandfather.

631
01:21:02,530 --> 01:21:05,396
Don't worry. We're well prepared.

632
01:23:19,197 --> 01:23:21,324
Tell me of the Americas.

633
01:23:24,737 --> 01:23:26,364
Will you never go back?

634
01:23:28,274 --> 01:23:30,264
Not all my memories are fond ones.

635
01:23:30,675 --> 01:23:33,472
And Mani? Does he miss his tribe?

636
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,970
His tribe is no more.

637
01:23:36,582 --> 01:23:41,018
Before our attack,
the pox had decimated his village.

638
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:43,849
Orders were to execute survivors.

639
01:23:43,955 --> 01:23:46,821
The women, and the children, too.

640
01:23:46,925 --> 01:23:48,483
Only Mani escaped.

641
01:23:49,394 --> 01:23:52,659
- How?
- We needed an interpreter.

642
01:23:53,198 --> 01:23:58,032
I was to teach him our language.
Then I found him slaying the Captain.

643
01:23:58,537 --> 01:24:00,697
Why didn't you turn him in?

644
01:24:01,172 --> 01:24:03,538
Know how the Captain waged battle?

645
01:24:04,309 --> 01:24:08,074
He gave his scouts
infected hospital sheets.

646
01:24:08,913 --> 01:24:13,406
The lroquois bought them.
Three weeks later, we'd mop up.

647
01:24:13,518 --> 01:24:17,579
- And that's our war?
- In any case, that is how we lost.

648
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:22,917
Where did he go?

649
01:24:24,062 --> 01:24:26,859
- To speak to the trees.
- Trees?

650
01:24:27,132 --> 01:24:28,496
Trees can speak.

651
01:24:30,769 --> 01:24:34,637
The white man cannot listen or see.

652
01:24:35,373 --> 01:24:36,771
See what, Mani?

653
01:24:43,614 --> 01:24:45,047
Want to learn?

654
01:24:45,516 --> 01:24:48,451
- What's this?
- An lndian sacrament.

655
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,410
At your own risk, Marquis.

656
01:24:55,192 --> 01:24:58,184
- What's it do?
- Depends on the person.

657
01:25:00,298 --> 01:25:02,765
They say they see the invisible.

658
01:25:04,702 --> 01:25:05,828
So, Mani?

659
01:25:06,437 --> 01:25:09,929
The Beast is in the forest.
The wolves will help us.

660
01:25:10,040 --> 01:25:11,336
I see no better.

661
01:25:11,442 --> 01:25:15,401
This night we shall dance
the dance of blood.

662
01:25:17,147 --> 01:25:21,048
And the Beast shall come to us
with the sun.

663
01:25:21,885 --> 01:25:23,408
It has no effect on me.

664
01:25:29,727 --> 01:25:33,060
Thatnight, Mani invoked spirits

665
01:25:33,162 --> 01:25:37,360
in a language
even Fronsac couldn't understand.

666
01:25:37,633 --> 01:25:40,602
And the wolves brought them to the Beast.

667
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:53,121
Don't worry, I'll fix this for you.

668
01:30:18,378 --> 01:30:22,404
Don't worry, girl. I'll see to you.

669
01:30:23,081 --> 01:30:25,605
I'll take care of you.

670
01:35:10,599 --> 01:35:14,466
Thomas is asleep. A close call.

671
01:35:15,636 --> 01:35:17,865
I'm sorry for the lndian.

672
01:35:18,139 --> 01:35:19,400
What is there?

673
01:35:19,807 --> 01:35:23,242
Tell me, what manor is this?
I need to know.

674
01:35:23,344 --> 01:35:26,676
It's a domain. A hunting ground.

675
01:35:29,717 --> 01:35:32,014
Sir, you need rest.

676
01:37:27,733 --> 01:37:29,222
Hurry! Fire!

677
01:41:41,215 --> 01:41:43,479
He's over there! Come on!

678
01:42:07,975 --> 01:42:10,808
Fronsac returned by Mani's side.

679
01:42:11,079 --> 01:42:13,706
His revenge had hardlybegun,

680
01:42:13,948 --> 01:42:16,246
but according to lndian custom,

681
01:42:16,351 --> 01:42:20,912
he mustbe sent to his ancestors
at dawn's firstlight.

682
01:42:26,761 --> 01:42:28,250
What do you want?

683
01:42:29,597 --> 01:42:32,429
Too much blood has been spilled.

684
01:42:32,699 --> 01:42:34,894
You're in great peril here.

685
01:42:35,937 --> 01:42:38,564
I have business to attend to.

686
01:42:39,173 --> 01:42:41,106
Is it worth your life?

687
01:42:43,443 --> 01:42:45,570
How long have you known?

688
01:42:46,446 --> 01:42:48,346
I don't know what you mean.

689
01:42:48,449 --> 01:42:50,916
Come now, Sardis. How?

690
01:42:52,386 --> 01:42:54,684
How did it get this far?

691
01:42:55,789 --> 01:42:57,882
No one will believe you.

692
01:43:00,327 --> 01:43:01,794
Go away, Sardis.

693
01:43:04,231 --> 01:43:05,664
May God save you.

694
01:43:07,534 --> 01:43:09,524
May the Devil take you.

695
01:43:30,757 --> 01:43:35,523
You're under arrest
by order of the lntendant.

696
01:43:35,629 --> 01:43:37,789
Please offer no resistance.

697
01:43:37,898 --> 01:43:38,989
That's ridiculous!

698
01:44:16,168 --> 01:44:19,068
- A lady to see you.
- Later. Tonight.

699
01:44:28,147 --> 01:44:30,580
Get up! You've got company.

700
01:44:30,683 --> 01:44:35,142
- Aren't I in solitary confinement?
- Depends for whom.

701
01:44:45,364 --> 01:44:46,420
Sorry.

702
01:44:49,335 --> 01:44:51,895
Bring your guest some dinner.

703
01:44:54,940 --> 01:44:57,931
- How?
- Many owe me favors.

704
01:44:59,210 --> 01:45:02,007
Help me. I must write to the King.

705
01:45:03,449 --> 01:45:06,781
You'd be hung before he read your letter.

706
01:45:07,086 --> 01:45:09,280
I've yet to stand trial.

707
01:45:09,954 --> 01:45:11,114
Here.

708
01:45:18,329 --> 01:45:21,730
- Tell me of the Beast.
- A trained animal.

709
01:45:22,034 --> 01:45:24,831
Cloaked in armor. I wounded it.

710
01:45:28,039 --> 01:45:30,166
Why the sudden interest?

711
01:45:30,275 --> 01:45:31,367
Two years ago,

712
01:45:32,143 --> 01:45:36,773
a confidential letter from Sardis
was given to the Pope.

713
01:45:37,115 --> 01:45:40,675
It spoke of a newly founded
secret society

714
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:44,054
whose purpose was to spread

715
01:45:44,154 --> 01:45:48,090
and defend, by any means,
the word of the Church.

716
01:45:49,260 --> 01:45:50,920
The Brotherhood.

717
01:45:51,261 --> 01:45:54,890
Sardis, he was using the Beast.

718
01:45:57,968 --> 01:46:01,495
The Beast is a warning to the King:

719
01:46:02,807 --> 01:46:06,708
"Heed the power of the Lord
or suffer Apocalypse."

720
01:46:07,311 --> 01:46:10,610
Members are known as "wolves of God."

721
01:46:12,884 --> 01:46:14,714
It serves the Church?

722
01:46:20,058 --> 01:46:25,017
Sardis serves only himself.
These wild times have made him mad.

723
01:46:25,196 --> 01:46:28,255
The group is beyond Rome's control.

724
01:46:32,803 --> 01:46:34,565
In whose employ are you?

725
01:46:34,671 --> 01:46:38,470
My duties include
never letting that be known.

726
01:46:46,116 --> 01:46:49,085
And you, you know quite enough.

727
01:46:59,462 --> 01:47:02,989
Mademoiselle de Morangias, what an honor.

728
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:06,794
How fares the Countess? Please sit down.

729
01:47:09,406 --> 01:47:12,169
And your father? Still in cure?

730
01:47:13,109 --> 01:47:15,703
He's too fond of rich food.

731
01:47:17,179 --> 01:47:19,739
Sir, you've arrested Fronsac.

732
01:47:21,718 --> 01:47:24,448
How far a man such as he has fallen!

733
01:47:24,621 --> 01:47:28,215
- He's neither thief nor murderer.
- Really?

734
01:47:28,658 --> 01:47:32,150
Hear me, he must have had his reasons.

735
01:47:32,328 --> 01:47:36,560
- If they killed the lndian--
- That's another matter.

736
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:41,692
You don't avenge a savage
with Christian blood.

737
01:47:44,140 --> 01:47:45,630
May I visit him?

738
01:47:56,786 --> 01:47:57,979
Impossible.

739
01:48:00,356 --> 01:48:01,447
Very well.

740
01:48:02,358 --> 01:48:04,758
Paris shall hear of this.

741
01:48:05,261 --> 01:48:06,888
You don't understand.

742
01:48:06,996 --> 01:48:08,929
Fronsac passed away...

743
01:48:10,198 --> 01:48:11,256
Iast night.

744
01:48:24,846 --> 01:48:27,781
In any case, they'd have hung him.

745
01:48:28,283 --> 01:48:31,013
Upon reflection, he was lucky.

746
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,045
He was in your custody.

747
01:48:35,257 --> 01:48:36,780
Perhaps he choked.

748
01:48:37,293 --> 01:48:40,023
Or he caught a blight in the mattress.

749
01:48:40,128 --> 01:48:43,393
You're lying. You're all lying!

750
01:48:45,067 --> 01:48:48,557
Courage, child, it's the will of God.

751
01:48:51,906 --> 01:48:53,133
Come.

752
01:48:53,275 --> 01:48:57,005
- I'll escort you home.
- She needs rest.

753
01:49:00,782 --> 01:49:02,977
- Let me alone!
- It's over.

754
01:49:07,756 --> 01:49:12,625
He's already reeking.
Bury him quickly in an unmarked grave.

755
01:49:13,495 --> 01:49:18,295
She threatened to go to the King.
That girl is dangerous.

756
01:49:24,038 --> 01:49:26,938
Fronsac was buried that verynight,

757
01:49:27,675 --> 01:49:31,474
Iong before news ofhis death
reached Paris.

758
01:49:32,347 --> 01:49:36,612
No one knew what secrets
he took to his grave.

759
01:49:38,585 --> 01:49:42,351
For several days,
the Beast did not strike.

760
01:49:43,290 --> 01:49:47,283
But the sudden disappearance
ofits most dauntless foe

761
01:49:47,395 --> 01:49:49,487
seemed to be a dark omen.

762
01:50:11,518 --> 01:50:12,610
Hurry.

763
01:50:20,426 --> 01:50:23,486
Father, I'm guilty. I have sinned.

764
01:50:23,896 --> 01:50:25,261
Forgive me.

765
01:50:26,366 --> 01:50:29,801
Marianne, day and night I think of her.

766
01:50:30,637 --> 01:50:33,799
I hear her heart beating in my chest.

767
01:50:34,975 --> 01:50:37,807
I want her on our side, Sardis.

768
01:50:37,910 --> 01:50:41,903
- The Lord is testing you.
- I can't endure it.

769
01:50:45,384 --> 01:50:46,544
The visions!

770
01:50:49,388 --> 01:50:52,550
These accursed visions torment me!

771
01:50:55,863 --> 01:50:57,727
Deliver me, Father!

772
01:50:58,598 --> 01:51:00,566
I beg of you!

773
01:51:02,535 --> 01:51:05,435
There's only one remedy for this evil.

774
01:52:09,467 --> 01:52:11,367
Don't drink, Sister.

775
01:52:13,471 --> 01:52:15,461
They want to kill you.

776
01:52:16,808 --> 01:52:18,708
But I won't let them.

777
01:52:20,478 --> 01:52:22,035
Who does?

778
01:52:23,949 --> 01:52:25,074
Who?

779
01:52:26,885 --> 01:52:30,286
We're going to leave, just you and me.

780
01:52:31,522 --> 01:52:33,353
How about America?

781
01:52:35,593 --> 01:52:38,619
You've hurt me, but I forgive you.

782
01:52:44,669 --> 01:52:47,933
Please. What are you doing?

783
01:52:48,940 --> 01:52:50,031
Stay.

784
01:52:55,013 --> 01:52:59,005
- Would I harm you?
- Please stay away from me.

785
01:53:00,986 --> 01:53:02,850
I need you.

786
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:07,184
You saved me when I was sick, no one else.

787
01:53:07,692 --> 01:53:10,455
The sight of your face
ended my nightmares.

788
01:53:10,561 --> 01:53:12,892
Your hand on my brow chased away demons.

789
01:53:12,997 --> 01:53:15,932
You can't imagine all I've done
to keep you near.

790
01:53:16,033 --> 01:53:18,797
I beg of you, don't shun me.

791
01:53:27,111 --> 01:53:28,442
Why?

792
01:53:32,716 --> 01:53:34,205
Do I disgust you?

793
01:53:34,318 --> 01:53:37,116
You don't frighten me. Get out.

794
01:53:39,757 --> 01:53:41,280
Because of this?

795
01:53:47,296 --> 01:53:48,694
Never fear.

796
01:53:50,067 --> 01:53:53,126
From now on, I'll take care of you.

797
01:53:54,505 --> 01:53:55,472
Look.

798
01:53:57,206 --> 01:54:00,334
No one knows. Only Sardis and l.

799
01:54:16,193 --> 01:54:18,524
Leave! Get out!

800
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:21,624
Why?

801
01:54:24,267 --> 01:54:26,257
You're not my brother.

802
01:54:26,969 --> 01:54:29,802
Another man returned from Africa.

803
01:54:29,906 --> 01:54:33,306
That's true, but it was for you I left.

804
01:54:34,977 --> 01:54:37,774
All this would not be, if not for you.

805
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:38,904
All this?

806
01:54:49,092 --> 01:54:53,961
It's your odor
that foul thing smelled on me.

807
01:54:56,833 --> 01:55:00,325
We're of the same blood.

808
01:55:03,438 --> 01:55:07,135
When father comes back, he'll kill you!

809
01:55:09,511 --> 01:55:13,640
Unless I kill him?
He's hindered us so long.

810
01:55:15,151 --> 01:55:18,244
Go ahead. Do it, go ahead!

811
01:55:42,544 --> 01:55:44,102
Why didn't you?

812
01:55:45,447 --> 01:55:47,505
Is it so difficult? Look.

813
01:55:47,616 --> 01:55:49,845
- Stop!
- Then you love me?

814
01:55:57,258 --> 01:55:59,123
I love you!

815
01:56:03,965 --> 01:56:07,331
Brothers, the Lord has told me

816
01:56:07,936 --> 01:56:10,029
the Beast will return

817
01:56:10,137 --> 01:56:14,631
to herald the return of values
to our decadent kingdom.

818
01:56:15,109 --> 01:56:17,771
And in a reborn France

819
01:56:18,213 --> 01:56:22,616
we shall be invisible princes,
for God is with us.

820
01:56:35,597 --> 01:56:38,759
Thepeople cannot fathom the Lord's wrath.

821
01:56:39,166 --> 01:56:41,930
The unjust censure of the King

822
01:56:42,836 --> 01:56:46,202
cannot withstand the public's rage.

823
01:56:46,807 --> 01:56:49,401
When that wrath is at a climax,

824
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:52,308
we'll bargain with the King.

825
01:56:52,646 --> 01:56:54,476
If he couldn't repress one,

826
01:56:54,582 --> 01:56:59,281
imagine if, from all over the realm,

827
01:56:59,386 --> 01:57:01,650
other beasts burst forth.

828
01:57:03,524 --> 01:57:07,425
The hour is at hand
to reap what we've sewn.

829
01:57:10,931 --> 01:57:13,228
Let us read from Malachi:

830
01:57:14,067 --> 01:57:18,435
"The word of the priest
is the depository of science,

831
01:57:18,706 --> 01:57:22,971
"and from his mouth is sought
knowledge of the law,

832
01:57:23,644 --> 01:57:26,771
"for he is the angel
of the Lord of Hosts."

833
01:57:26,880 --> 01:57:29,313
"He who adores the Beast

834
01:57:30,883 --> 01:57:33,316
"shall drink the Lord's wrath.

835
01:57:33,753 --> 01:57:38,019
"He shall be tormented
in the fire and brimstone

836
01:57:38,124 --> 01:57:39,647
"before the angels,

837
01:57:39,759 --> 01:57:43,922
"and the smoke shall rise
in the century of centuries."

838
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:47,163
I've come back to name you :

839
01:57:47,434 --> 01:57:51,199
Pierre-Jean Laffont.
Geneviève de Morangias.

840
01:57:51,704 --> 01:57:53,227
Maxime Des Forêts.

841
01:57:53,740 --> 01:57:57,175
Gontrand de Moncan. Henri Sardis.

842
01:57:58,044 --> 01:58:00,910
Jean-François de Morangias.

843
01:58:02,715 --> 01:58:03,682
Amen!

844
01:59:51,021 --> 01:59:52,181
Fire!

845
02:00:03,001 --> 02:00:06,800
Bastards! You're all under arrest!

846
02:00:57,420 --> 02:00:59,149
Ghost or no ghost...

847
02:01:01,125 --> 02:01:02,682
I'll split you in two.

848
02:01:15,205 --> 02:01:17,536
See? No need to hold back.

849
02:01:18,241 --> 02:01:19,799
I never intended to.

850
02:01:19,909 --> 02:01:23,310
Too late. The Beast is immortal now.

851
02:01:23,413 --> 02:01:25,710
Perhaps, but you are not!

852
02:02:17,299 --> 02:02:20,427
- You trained the Beast.
- How'd you know?

853
02:02:20,904 --> 02:02:22,872
You use silver bullets.

854
02:03:18,927 --> 02:03:21,224
Marianne, look!

855
02:03:34,375 --> 02:03:36,775
Marianne's not here, madman.

856
02:03:37,445 --> 02:03:39,640
You've united us forever.

857
02:04:09,610 --> 02:04:11,407
Line the bastards up!

858
02:04:11,678 --> 02:04:13,168
Who do you think you are?

859
02:04:15,182 --> 02:04:16,979
Look at them!

860
02:04:17,918 --> 02:04:20,477
Not so high and mighty now!

861
02:04:20,654 --> 02:04:22,212
Get back!

862
02:04:42,208 --> 02:04:44,835
- He's dead.
- Now it's certain.

863
02:04:46,780 --> 02:04:48,042
And Sardis?

864
02:04:48,915 --> 02:04:53,875
Wherever he runs, we'll find him.
Or the mountain will take him.

865
02:04:57,023 --> 02:04:59,547
Shall we celebrate properly?

866
02:05:00,160 --> 02:05:02,128
You've killed me once.

867
02:05:03,029 --> 02:05:05,293
The better to revive you.

868
02:05:07,267 --> 02:05:12,101
I could introduce you in Rome.
Will you come with me?

869
02:05:16,943 --> 02:05:18,103
Too late.

870
02:05:18,777 --> 02:05:23,237
I like you, Fronsac.
You make me forget all my duties.

871
02:05:34,060 --> 02:05:36,892
Leave, before I change my mind.

872
02:07:10,621 --> 02:07:14,557
- Marquis, what is it?
- Marianne.

873
02:07:15,126 --> 02:07:18,562
I've had her brought home. She's dying.

874
02:07:23,000 --> 02:07:26,162
Get out! Go away! All of you!

875
02:07:40,817 --> 02:07:42,546
Wake up!

876
02:07:48,258 --> 02:07:50,122
Forgive me.

877
02:07:55,499 --> 02:07:56,795
I love you.

878
02:09:24,853 --> 02:09:28,812
Yearspassed,
but Grégoire de Fronsac

879
02:09:28,924 --> 02:09:33,122
and Marianne de Morangias
never left my memory.

880
02:09:33,295 --> 02:09:36,889
The world that made the Beast
is dying away,

881
02:09:38,267 --> 02:09:43,102
and I musthasten,
formy story, too, is ending.

882
02:09:52,347 --> 02:09:57,216
I remember Fronsac and I
atJean-François'hideaway

883
02:09:58,020 --> 02:10:01,420
where the Beast awaited its final hour.

884
02:11:42,756 --> 02:11:45,849
The old healer told us all he knew.

885
02:11:47,193 --> 02:11:50,594
Jean-François brought
an animal back from Africa,

886
02:11:50,697 --> 02:11:52,288
who had a litter.

887
02:11:52,732 --> 02:11:56,189
Only one cub was kept, the strongest.

888
02:11:57,571 --> 02:12:00,062
Patiently and cruelly,

889
02:12:00,874 --> 02:12:04,173
he'd trained it to be vicious.

890
02:12:14,521 --> 02:12:17,512
Thus died the Beast of Gévaudan.

891
02:12:18,457 --> 02:12:21,017
And I, Thomas d'Apcher,

892
02:12:21,560 --> 02:12:25,360
am probably the last to know
the whole truth.

893
02:12:59,498 --> 02:13:02,557
The Chevalier invited me to Africa,

894
02:13:03,102 --> 02:13:05,070
but my land needed rebuilding.

895
02:13:05,171 --> 02:13:07,731
My duty was to my countrymen.

896
02:13:09,108 --> 02:13:12,235
I've often thought
of Grégoire and Marianne

897
02:13:12,344 --> 02:13:17,178
throughout these peaceful years
that have brought me to this age.

898
02:13:19,117 --> 02:13:21,277
I never saw them again,

899
02:13:22,221 --> 02:13:26,851
but I like to think they lived happily,
far from here.
