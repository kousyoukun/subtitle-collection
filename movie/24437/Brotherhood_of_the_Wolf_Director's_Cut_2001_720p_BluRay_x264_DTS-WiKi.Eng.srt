1
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,561
My lord, time is short.
leave now, l beg you.

2
00:01:04,737 --> 00:01:06,432
you'll be arrested.

3
00:01:06,605 --> 00:01:08,232
fetch some candles.

4
00:01:09,241 --> 00:01:10,708
l'll be working late.

5
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,705
and my usual glass of wine.

6
00:01:18,017 --> 00:01:20,281
this world had to xhange,

7
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,651
but the revolution is now
a terror sweeping the land,

8
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,248
and it's my turn to be swept aside,

9
00:01:30,162 --> 00:01:34,064
old prejudixes make men blind,
drive them mad,,,

10
00:01:35,134 --> 00:01:39,070
devour their hearts
and turn them into beasts,

11
00:03:11,096 --> 00:03:13,564
ln the year 1764,

12
00:03:13,899 --> 00:03:17,460
the beastreaxhed our soil
and made it its own,

13
00:03:18,203 --> 00:03:23,106
a year later, its fame had spread
beyond the borders of our provinxe,

14
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:27,744
and it seemed no mortal
would ever overxo me it,

15
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,848
the beast's assaults

16
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:34,345
slowly sank the region of gevaudan
into darkness,

17
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,415
who goes there?

18
00:06:20,586 --> 00:06:21,951
what's he done?

19
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,316
- what?
- he's a thief.

20
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:29,425
and her?

21
00:06:29,561 --> 00:06:32,086
his daughter. damned witch !

22
00:06:32,965 --> 00:06:35,593
l healed their horses. they owe me.

23
00:06:35,934 --> 00:06:38,129
don't listen. they're liars!

24
00:06:38,303 --> 00:06:40,168
- did he heal the horses?
- yes.

25
00:06:53,185 --> 00:06:54,243
begone!

26
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:22,779
welcome to the land of the beast!
beware of wolf traps!

27
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:27,909
sir gregoire de fronsax

28
00:07:28,186 --> 00:07:32,953
and the man they xalled mani
were neither hunters nor soldiers,

29
00:07:33,091 --> 00:07:38,154
a naturalist at the king's garden,
fronsax was a libertine

30
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,854
and a fine wit,

31
00:07:40,198 --> 00:07:42,564
the man who shadowed him

32
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:46,268
was a mysterious foreigner,

33
00:07:48,373 --> 00:07:52,901
at nightfall, the travelers arrived
at the xastle of marquis d'apxher,

34
00:07:53,412 --> 00:07:57,849
their protextorin gevaudan
for the duration of their mission,

35
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:31,382
our people fear no ordinary wolf.
the beast is different.

36
00:08:32,317 --> 00:08:35,548
lt flees men
as if it knew to fear them,

37
00:08:35,687 --> 00:08:37,951
yet spares no woman or child.

38
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,955
have you ever seen it?

39
00:08:40,892 --> 00:08:43,861
how do you know it's just one animal?

40
00:08:43,995 --> 00:08:46,964
the survivors all say the same.

41
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:51,333
lt's bigger than a wolf
and has no fear of fire arms.

42
00:08:51,903 --> 00:08:54,394
l understand your skepticism.

43
00:08:55,707 --> 00:08:59,040
l don't believe any more than you
in dragons.

44
00:08:59,177 --> 00:09:01,771
l've had a report drawn up,

45
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,846
a memoir of the beast's crimes.

46
00:09:06,885 --> 00:09:08,648
judge for yourself.

47
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:15,521
you battled the english in new france?

48
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:19,953
yes, l went to study animals and nature.

49
00:09:21,032 --> 00:09:24,433
l returned with wounds
and a captain's rank.

50
00:09:27,005 --> 00:09:30,907
l've organized a hospital
for victims of the beast,

51
00:09:31,076 --> 00:09:33,101
in an old priory.

52
00:09:34,513 --> 00:09:36,378
a woman from lorciere.

53
00:09:36,815 --> 00:09:40,216
the beast attacked her
coming from the fair.

54
00:09:40,352 --> 00:09:44,982
two men saved her, the beast fled,
but took half her face.

55
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:50,560
tell me, how is M. buffon?

56
00:09:51,496 --> 00:09:53,191
and how fares paris?

57
00:09:57,235 --> 00:09:59,829
and l'lngenu? have you read it?

58
00:10:00,005 --> 00:10:03,168
lt's a bit late to discuss philosophy.

59
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:06,401
quite right. let's speak of theater.

60
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:11,345
do you know any actresses?
what's in the theater this winter?

61
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,247
put it there.

62
00:10:13,385 --> 00:10:18,288
they are a gallant lot, it's said.
l've read some are free with their charms.

63
00:10:18,924 --> 00:10:20,186
do tell me.

64
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:27,364
here, to satisfy your curiosity.

65
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:32,266
the merxure de franxe!
we only get the courrier d'avignon,

66
00:10:32,771 --> 00:10:35,604
- l'll show you the common room.
- he'll stay here.

67
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,106
very well. good night, sir.

68
00:10:44,216 --> 00:10:47,049
lt's not versailles, but the wine's good.

69
00:11:48,713 --> 00:11:50,340
lt's big as a cow.

70
00:11:54,185 --> 00:11:58,622
jacques says he's seen many wolves.
lt's no wolf.

71
00:11:58,757 --> 00:12:01,885
lts snout is longer,
its teeth are like knives.

72
00:12:09,668 --> 00:12:14,298
- lf not a wolf, what was it then?
- a demon.

73
00:12:14,739 --> 00:12:18,766
chevalier, the beast has struck
near st. alban.

74
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,532
there.

75
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:45,460
there's no one there.

76
00:12:45,604 --> 00:12:46,571
halt!

77
00:12:48,073 --> 00:12:51,042
what are those bastards doing here?

78
00:12:51,376 --> 00:12:52,741
good day, captain.

79
00:12:53,979 --> 00:12:57,710
good day, Marquis. My respects.

80
00:12:58,283 --> 00:13:00,615
beware. there are traps.

81
00:13:01,586 --> 00:13:05,750
duhamel, sir gregoire de fronsac
of the king's gardens.

82
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:11,528
he'd like to examine her body,
with your permission, of course.

83
00:13:12,564 --> 00:13:15,431
the one who brutalized my men?

84
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,395
- had l known you ordered--
- l did not.

85
00:13:20,338 --> 00:13:23,398
you did well, and l beg your pardon.

86
00:13:24,042 --> 00:13:27,671
they're soldiers trained for war,
not hunting.

87
00:13:28,913 --> 00:13:31,973
careful, she's stuffed with poison.

88
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,224
what sort of gardener are you?

89
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:49,299
when the beast is killed,
his Majesty wants it studied in paris.

90
00:13:49,768 --> 00:13:53,226
l'll keep it after it's captured.

91
00:13:53,672 --> 00:13:55,299
l'm having a look.

92
00:13:58,443 --> 00:14:02,209
with that jaw,
it must weigh 500 pounds.

93
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,746
this time, l'll get it...

94
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:07,215
before the snow.

95
00:14:07,585 --> 00:14:09,917
lt can't get away.

96
00:14:10,055 --> 00:14:12,148
- ever seen it?
- once.

97
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:16,751
once, in my musket sight.
l wounded it, my word on it.

98
00:14:16,895 --> 00:14:19,625
lt collapsed, then at once revived.

99
00:14:19,764 --> 00:14:23,894
we lost it near Mt. Mouchet,
vanished in the wood.

100
00:14:24,836 --> 00:14:26,701
did it look like this?

101
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:33,568
lt had a black stripe
and spike on its back.

102
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,597
My friends, this is the sketch artist,

103
00:14:54,165 --> 00:14:56,531
sir gregoire de fronsac.

104
00:14:57,135 --> 00:15:00,229
a man of providence indeed,
come from paris to--

105
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:01,497
sketch the beast.

106
00:15:02,107 --> 00:15:05,235
his eminence, the bishop de Mende,

107
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:07,443
the duke de Moncan,

108
00:15:07,579 --> 00:15:10,013
the count de Morangias,

109
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:12,706
and Madame the countess.

110
00:15:13,051 --> 00:15:17,511
their son, jean-francois,
who has also traveled.

111
00:15:19,724 --> 00:15:23,160
- a clever hand, sir.
- thank you, sir.

112
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:30,366
M. laffont, our intendant.

113
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:34,435
father henri sardis of st. alban's.

114
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:43,273
tell us, sir, is there talk
of the beast in paris?

115
00:15:43,982 --> 00:15:47,713
- they've written ballads.
- prayers would do better!

116
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,548
does capt. duhamel so need god?

117
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:52,380
don't we all?

118
00:15:52,857 --> 00:15:56,224
duhamel just dresses his men as women

119
00:15:56,361 --> 00:15:58,295
to bait the beast.

120
00:15:58,763 --> 00:16:00,890
he's doing what he can.

121
00:16:01,065 --> 00:16:02,657
such indulgence!

122
00:16:03,334 --> 00:16:05,325
duhamel is incompetent.

123
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:09,099
his hunts exhaust the people,
his ruffians devastate our land,

124
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:11,435
and the beast roams free.

125
00:16:11,609 --> 00:16:16,046
lf duhamel is all l get
for paying my taxes to paris,

126
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:19,106
l'd rather give it to my valets.

127
00:16:19,517 --> 00:16:23,419
- what do you say, sir?
- you're not obliged to reply.

128
00:16:23,555 --> 00:16:27,082
his lordship likes to argue,
but he's a good christian.

129
00:16:27,225 --> 00:16:31,184
when you arrived,
this assembly was talking my ears off

130
00:16:31,329 --> 00:16:33,388
with god this and god that.

131
00:16:33,531 --> 00:16:37,023
lt's said the pope sent a spy to see

132
00:16:37,168 --> 00:16:40,831
if the beast is
a manifestation of the devil.

133
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,390
pardon me.

134
00:17:14,706 --> 00:17:19,234
Marianne de Morangias.
a daunting task indeed.

135
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,704
the most elusive quarry in our land.

136
00:17:22,113 --> 00:17:26,243
- who's the hapless hunter?
- des forets, a playwright.

137
00:17:27,118 --> 00:17:31,145
- then it's simple.
- careful, she's a Morangias.

138
00:17:35,827 --> 00:17:37,852
sir, we were conferring--

139
00:17:37,996 --> 00:17:40,021
- M. des forets?
- himself.

140
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:43,531
an honor. good writers are rare.

141
00:17:43,668 --> 00:17:45,465
Marquis d'apcher spoke of you.

142
00:17:46,104 --> 00:17:48,766
he thought of you for his memoirs.

143
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,872
really?

144
00:17:50,008 --> 00:17:53,205
he's in good spirits.
but have some finesse.

145
00:17:53,378 --> 00:17:57,212
wait till he broaches the subject.

146
00:17:58,182 --> 00:17:59,410
excuse me.

147
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:04,119
- have you no shame?
- none.

148
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:08,350
does the naturalist like our country?

149
00:18:08,493 --> 00:18:12,930
l've only glimpsed its beauties so far,
or one of them.

150
00:18:14,232 --> 00:18:16,530
ls such the talk of court?

151
00:18:17,268 --> 00:18:20,999
no, this is a couplet
reserved for provincials.

152
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:25,876
l might go to court
if there were ladies like you.

153
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:30,504
dinner is served. let's go in.

154
00:18:31,082 --> 00:18:32,845
whither thou goest...

155
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:40,089
ln sailing up the st. lawrence
we found in our nets

156
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:43,419
the strangest animal l'd ever seen.

157
00:18:44,062 --> 00:18:46,360
l'd heard of the native's sacred fish,

158
00:18:46,497 --> 00:18:49,432
but l was sure it was a legend.

159
00:18:50,435 --> 00:18:52,699
l was looking at a fish

160
00:18:52,837 --> 00:18:56,102
the shape and size of a trout,

161
00:18:56,975 --> 00:19:01,878
but which was entirely covered
in a rich black fur.

162
00:19:03,481 --> 00:19:06,143
a furry trout? surely you jest.

163
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:07,308
no, sir.

164
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:24,130
salmo truta dermopilla from canada.

165
00:19:25,236 --> 00:19:26,828
soft as mink.

166
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:37,210
- nature is extraordinary!
- the water must be cold!

167
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:40,676
this proves the impossible
may be possible.

168
00:19:40,818 --> 00:19:41,750
well said.

169
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,251
lt surely won you the king's favor.

170
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,517
l doubt he deserves it.

171
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:51,359
though l do recognize
your comedic talent.

172
00:19:51,863 --> 00:19:54,331
had l two hands, l'd applaud.

173
00:19:56,968 --> 00:20:00,802
- please pardon him.
- your son is right.

174
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:04,037
this animal doesn't exist.

175
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:07,373
My taxidermist is a clever man.

176
00:20:07,912 --> 00:20:09,743
please excuse the prank.

177
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:14,140
should this fable convince us
there is no beast?

178
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:16,310
that we're simpletons?

179
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:18,512
the moral of the fable

180
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:21,989
is that dragons and unicorns
only appear in fables.

181
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,727
lies appear true when dressed in latin.

182
00:20:25,863 --> 00:20:29,697
careful, sir. we may lose
all sense of what you're saying.

183
00:20:30,168 --> 00:20:33,604
lndeed, are you a naturalist
or a philosopher?

184
00:20:33,738 --> 00:20:35,672
or worse, an actor!

185
00:20:35,807 --> 00:20:38,901
l believe the knight is,
above all, parisian.

186
00:20:39,077 --> 00:20:42,672
enough talk of the beast.
after all, it only preys on peasants.

187
00:20:42,847 --> 00:20:45,816
how about a guessing game? charades?

188
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:50,716
l've just composed a lover's lament.
May l, countess?

189
00:20:50,988 --> 00:20:53,889
- lf it isn't licentious.
- oh no.

190
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,423
lt's very chaste and pure.

191
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:59,121
lt's an improvisation.

192
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,255
lt's called ''wolves howl''.

193
00:21:08,306 --> 00:21:12,766
''l went not warily
though l bore no malice, verily

194
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:17,005
''your sly eye caught my heart
in its prowl

195
00:21:17,448 --> 00:21:21,043
''l howl''

196
00:21:35,633 --> 00:21:37,464
shall l see you soon?

197
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:40,036
have you other amazing animals to show me?

198
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:45,074
you seem set in your idea of me.
allow me to change your mind.

199
00:21:45,209 --> 00:21:46,403
try.

200
00:21:47,512 --> 00:21:50,310
- coming to the hunt?
- certainly.

201
00:21:50,848 --> 00:21:54,147
l can't allow it. too dangerous.

202
00:21:55,219 --> 00:21:58,450
obedience is the virtue
of well-born girls.

203
00:21:58,589 --> 00:22:00,819
this young man is right.

204
00:22:05,596 --> 00:22:07,723
that dayin gevaudan,

205
00:22:08,132 --> 00:22:11,260
there was the greatesthunt
everin franxe,

206
00:22:12,336 --> 00:22:16,295
the king offered 6,000pounds bounty
for the beast,

207
00:22:16,474 --> 00:22:19,637
thousands ofenlistedpeasants,
swordsmen and soldiers

208
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,439
werejoined by everyhunter
and adventurerin the region,

209
00:22:24,148 --> 00:22:28,949
for a fewhours,
we forgot we were the hunted,

210
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:35,147
you each have a map and a location.
Movements begin at 7:00.

211
00:23:35,286 --> 00:23:36,218
thank you.

212
00:23:36,354 --> 00:23:39,915
you might well thank us!
My people have better things to do.

213
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:42,787
your generosity rivals your courage.

214
00:23:42,927 --> 00:23:46,419
enough ! for your sake,
we'd better take it.

215
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:49,124
we shall, your lordship.

216
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,467
what is this ruckus?

217
00:27:09,333 --> 00:27:11,233
fine weapon, isn't it?

218
00:27:11,368 --> 00:27:14,496
l had it made in Mende after a campaign.

219
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:17,505
custom-made for me, of course.

220
00:27:20,077 --> 00:27:24,275
look. even in paris
you'll never see such a bullet.

221
00:27:24,415 --> 00:27:26,110
l make them myself.

222
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:28,718
silver? afraid of werewolves?

223
00:27:30,888 --> 00:27:33,356
l like to sign my shots.

224
00:27:33,824 --> 00:27:37,885
l'm a hunter, fronsac.
and it has cost me dearly.

225
00:27:38,295 --> 00:27:39,922
how did it happen?

226
00:27:40,397 --> 00:27:44,925
l learned the hard way
that one bullet won't always suffice.

227
00:27:45,069 --> 00:27:49,938
and, sardis notwithstanding,
prayer won't cure gangrene.

228
00:27:50,374 --> 00:27:53,366
- did a bear injure you?
- a lion.

229
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:58,212
yes, two years in the navy,
l traveled a lot.

230
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:00,249
do you know africa?

231
00:28:01,151 --> 00:28:04,018
My lords, my daughter caused all this.

232
00:28:04,154 --> 00:28:06,748
here. punish her as you will.

233
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:12,051
witch !

234
00:28:13,097 --> 00:28:15,361
she's a daughter of the devil!

235
00:28:15,733 --> 00:28:19,567
- a demon has got her!
- she's ill!

236
00:28:19,937 --> 00:28:24,033
she's not possessed!

237
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:31,179
burn her!

238
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:38,445
she mustn't swallow her tongue.
she'd suffocate.

239
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,954
- she's not possessed.
- l know.

240
00:28:53,771 --> 00:28:57,730
naturalist, philosopher
and a bonesetter as well?

241
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:11,079
she didn't show. l won the bet.

242
00:29:20,464 --> 00:29:21,658
Marquis.

243
00:29:33,711 --> 00:29:35,303
and the natives?

244
00:29:37,414 --> 00:29:40,315
superstitious brutes, like here.

245
00:29:41,885 --> 00:29:46,379
lndian hunters eat the hearts
of their prey for strength.

246
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:48,423
are they brutes then?

247
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,824
ln africa, it's their enemies' hearts.

248
00:29:52,229 --> 00:29:56,825
My lord the count, jean-francois,
you must move east...

249
00:29:58,035 --> 00:29:59,400
there you are.

250
00:29:59,603 --> 00:30:02,299
your mother will be worried.

251
00:30:02,673 --> 00:30:06,973
she always is.
lf l listened, l'd be in a convent.

252
00:30:07,411 --> 00:30:10,471
l knew you didn't believe me.
you're a libertine.

253
00:30:10,648 --> 00:30:14,049
- not when l'm in love.
- you're in love?

254
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:22,151
ridiculous! we've hardly met.

255
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,119
you thought l meant you?

256
00:30:32,603 --> 00:30:35,629
she must learn to ride like a lady.

257
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:39,201
no harm in a little exercise.

258
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:46,006
- My father sees no evil.
- My son sees evil everywhere.

259
00:31:42,106 --> 00:31:44,233
people died here.

260
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,799
how do you know?

261
00:31:48,645 --> 00:31:50,078
l hear their cries.

262
00:31:50,481 --> 00:31:52,210
Mani, stop it.

263
00:31:52,416 --> 00:31:56,147
he's right. this was a templar stronghold.

264
00:31:56,987 --> 00:32:00,286
twenty-five heretics
were burned alive in the chapel.

265
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:05,254
- ls he a seer?
- no need to be.

266
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,564
you just need to look.

267
00:32:21,745 --> 00:32:24,213
My brother and l played here.

268
00:32:24,848 --> 00:32:26,543
were you not afraid?

269
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:30,518
he said he would protect me from ghosts.

270
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:47,087
- no taste for the hunt?
- that a crime here?

271
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:52,931
the lndians say
a portrait steals the soul.

272
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:55,797
My soul interests you as well?

273
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:40,908
on foot at a hunt?

274
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:44,178
- My fault.
- l didn't ask you.

275
00:34:46,757 --> 00:34:50,090
- what possessed you?
- lt's only a wolf.

276
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:53,989
- and if it were the beast?
- l don't think so.

277
00:34:58,435 --> 00:34:59,697
thank you.

278
00:35:06,944 --> 00:35:10,107
pray the beast is one of these wolves.

279
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,044
these won't devour anyone now.

280
00:35:14,751 --> 00:35:16,218
curious fellow.

281
00:35:16,787 --> 00:35:19,449
- where did you find him?
- new france.

282
00:35:20,824 --> 00:35:23,156
ls he an acadian?

283
00:35:23,627 --> 00:35:26,619
an lndian. a Mohawk lroquois.

284
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,424
an lndian? a real one?
he doesn't look it.

285
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:36,963
come to st. alban tonight.
we'll have fun with your valet.

286
00:35:37,107 --> 00:35:38,802
he's not my valet.

287
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:41,672
- what then?
- he's my brother.

288
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:09,000
really! Mixing your blood
with that of a savage?

289
00:36:10,307 --> 00:36:13,105
a man who shares one's hardship
is no savage.

290
00:36:13,744 --> 00:36:16,804
Mani saved me from the english
at trois rivieres.

291
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,876
l thought the savages were cannibals.

292
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:24,314
as you can see, sir, Mani is no animal.

293
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:32,022
can you reproduce
with a woman of our race?

294
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:39,263
all women are the same color
when candles blow out.

295
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:42,336
yes, father, they even have wit.

296
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:45,368
lndians and whites have had children.

297
00:36:45,509 --> 00:36:47,704
we're one species.

298
00:36:47,844 --> 00:36:51,575
don't speak too soon.
lt's a bit like the negroes.

299
00:36:52,949 --> 00:36:54,780
what say you, sardis?

300
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:58,053
your blood brother is god's child.

301
00:36:58,455 --> 00:37:00,889
- has he been baptized?
- he hasn't asked.

302
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:03,219
you are a man of your times!

303
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,260
Mani has his beliefs.

304
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:09,422
at home, he was a sort of priest.

305
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:13,332
lf they have priests, they're doomed.

306
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,199
what are these beliefs?

307
00:37:15,338 --> 00:37:19,331
each man has an animal spirit,
called a totem.

308
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:21,705
amusing. how does it work?

309
00:37:25,115 --> 00:37:26,446
would you?

310
00:37:35,992 --> 00:37:38,256
never fear, it won't hurt.

311
00:37:48,171 --> 00:37:51,299
caribou. a sort of stag.

312
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,873
what says my wife?

313
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:59,277
am l a stag because of my horns
or because of something else?

314
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:04,019
and my dear thomas, what's his totem?

315
00:38:04,254 --> 00:38:06,449
worm. bookworm probably.

316
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:16,588
snake.

317
00:38:17,801 --> 00:38:20,326
for lndians, the snake embodies wisdom.

318
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:21,869
serpent wise.

319
00:38:22,205 --> 00:38:23,832
and our intendant?

320
00:38:28,245 --> 00:38:29,405
boar.

321
00:38:31,214 --> 00:38:32,647
lighten your spirit.

322
00:38:33,083 --> 00:38:37,144
perhaps for these barbarians
the pig is nobility.

323
00:38:37,954 --> 00:38:39,717
who's next? sardis?

324
00:38:45,362 --> 00:38:46,522
and me?

325
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:50,428
what am l, a semi-lion?

326
00:38:51,268 --> 00:38:52,758
half an eagle?

327
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:57,732
Make me a lizard,
so my arm may grow back.

328
00:38:57,941 --> 00:38:59,841
jean-francois, enough.

329
00:39:02,879 --> 00:39:05,279
what? have l been gauche?

330
00:39:06,983 --> 00:39:09,679
let me be.

331
00:39:10,587 --> 00:39:12,987
Mademoiselle? your turn?

332
00:39:14,691 --> 00:39:17,854
pardon me,
but l'm weary of your tricks.

333
00:39:17,994 --> 00:39:22,192
l'll retire before you begin
juggling or dancing on a ball.

334
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:23,731
good night.

335
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:46,212
lt'll cheer you, fronsac.

336
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:51,293
lt's the best house in Mende.
you'll sleep better than at an inn.

337
00:40:04,674 --> 00:40:08,542
they're all for you.
and the new girl is very...

338
00:40:10,981 --> 00:40:12,710
dear little Marquis.

339
00:40:13,183 --> 00:40:14,343
come.

340
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:02,456
l'm expensive, gregoire de fronsac.

341
00:41:02,899 --> 00:41:07,529
- do you know me?
- ln here, gevaudan becomes very small.

342
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:09,733
ltalian?

343
00:41:11,508 --> 00:41:13,442
just passing through.

344
00:41:15,679 --> 00:41:17,237
l have money.

345
00:41:17,947 --> 00:41:21,474
lt's not only a matter of money.

346
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,183
what then?

347
00:41:54,217 --> 00:41:59,120
- who did that to you?
- an lroquois arrow.

348
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,281
not far from the heart.

349
00:42:03,226 --> 00:42:06,718
l may be a lucky man.

350
00:42:08,998 --> 00:42:10,329
and that?

351
00:42:12,669 --> 00:42:13,829
a bear.

352
00:42:15,605 --> 00:42:18,096
he didn't care much for me.

353
00:42:26,683 --> 00:42:29,208
you haven't seen anything yet.

354
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,898
My business is dangerous.

355
00:42:47,303 --> 00:42:49,362
some men aren't so nice.

356
00:42:54,544 --> 00:42:57,138
something to remember me by.

357
00:43:01,751 --> 00:43:04,151
a scandal! ln my house!

358
00:43:05,922 --> 00:43:08,823
- valentine!
- l don't lay with sorcerers!

359
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:11,791
- what?
- snakes on him! l saw them move!

360
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:14,362
our reputation ! you have to go!

361
00:43:14,497 --> 00:43:17,955
lt's nothing.
he's an lndian, not a sorcerer.

362
00:43:18,101 --> 00:43:21,366
- then no lndians!
- you have delicate whores.

363
00:43:22,138 --> 00:43:25,665
come on, girls.
who will go with our redskin?

364
00:43:26,276 --> 00:43:28,471
l'll double the fee.

365
00:43:28,845 --> 00:43:32,872
- l like his tattoos.
- that settles that.

366
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,013
so, a sorcerer are we?

367
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:28,334
will you do my portrait?

368
00:44:29,038 --> 00:44:30,835
lf you don't behave.

369
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:53,788
weekspassed, and duhamel's men
xouldn't find the beast,

370
00:44:55,198 --> 00:44:58,725
a third winter would be spent
underits reign,

371
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:04,138
the snow xould not stop it
anymore than ourrifles and dogs,

372
00:45:09,312 --> 00:45:13,715
recall how god warned us
through the words of Moses:

373
00:45:15,386 --> 00:45:19,652
''l shall xome unto you like a bear
whose xubs are ravished,

374
00:45:21,592 --> 00:45:26,154
''as a lion l shall devour your children
and spill their entrails.

375
00:45:27,498 --> 00:45:30,228
''l will set upon ye a fearsome beast

376
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:33,336
''to consume you and your flocks,

377
00:45:33,471 --> 00:45:36,099
''and make your fields barren.''

378
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:49,409
how long, o lord, wouldst thou forsake us?

379
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:17,047
a candle for each victim.
ls this truly the age of reason?

380
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:33,688
have mercy!

381
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:36,461
forgive me!

382
00:46:37,502 --> 00:46:38,730
have mercy!

383
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,071
bless me!

384
00:46:46,744 --> 00:46:48,405
what is it, my son?

385
00:46:48,546 --> 00:46:52,073
god has punished me!
My children vanished on Mt. Mouchet!

386
00:46:52,383 --> 00:46:55,284
l'm damned! we all are!

387
00:46:58,255 --> 00:47:01,088
gather your men. we must leave.

388
00:47:07,164 --> 00:47:09,394
alert Mani. l'll find you on the way!

389
00:47:17,842 --> 00:47:19,776
hello, friend of the wolves.

390
00:47:20,010 --> 00:47:22,240
l have something for you.

391
00:47:28,452 --> 00:47:31,717
l want to see you. alone.

392
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:39,296
ln 10 days my mother's going to a retreat
and my father to a cure.

393
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:42,866
- ten days?
- l'm not as free as you.

394
00:49:07,718 --> 00:49:08,912
the torch.

395
00:49:10,154 --> 00:49:11,621
bring the torch !

396
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:19,188
the storm is rising; the men are tired.

397
00:49:19,496 --> 00:49:20,827
we'd best go home.

398
00:49:21,732 --> 00:49:23,996
no. we must find the girl.

399
00:50:05,242 --> 00:50:06,903
l found the child.

400
00:50:25,729 --> 00:50:30,666
captain, your web of traps
snares more peasants than wolves,

401
00:50:31,502 --> 00:50:34,801
your men have plundered the population,

402
00:50:35,472 --> 00:50:39,772
and since you began,
the wolf has taken 12 more lives.

403
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:43,179
lt should never have escaped us.

404
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:44,440
how's that?

405
00:50:44,581 --> 00:50:47,516
lt should never have escaped us.

406
00:50:47,685 --> 00:50:49,312
what say you, fronsac?

407
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:52,648
what sort of wolf is this?

408
00:50:58,028 --> 00:51:01,794
My only certainty is that this is no wolf.

409
00:51:02,666 --> 00:51:07,535
wolves don't attack men, or very rarely.
l studied them in new france.

410
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:10,572
perhaps our wolves are different.

411
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,801
a rabid wolf will attack.

412
00:51:13,377 --> 00:51:15,902
and dies within a fortnight.

413
00:51:16,046 --> 00:51:18,913
for two years,
the beast has had its bloody reign.

414
00:51:19,550 --> 00:51:23,042
lts victims bear wounds
no wolf could inflict.

415
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:28,022
l've often found upon the body

416
00:51:28,158 --> 00:51:30,149
a piece of this metal.

417
00:51:30,694 --> 00:51:33,185
- so?
- so...

418
00:51:35,666 --> 00:51:38,396
no animal has fangs of iron.

419
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:45,631
then the beast is not an animal? fine.

420
00:51:46,610 --> 00:51:48,043
how do we catch it?

421
00:51:48,178 --> 00:51:50,908
while we speculate,
it's killing our people.

422
00:51:51,415 --> 00:51:55,909
gentlemen, let us hear M. de fronsac
with utmost attention.

423
00:51:57,654 --> 00:51:59,747
so you say, sir,

424
00:51:59,923 --> 00:52:02,824
this is no ordinary animal.

425
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:05,025
we all think so.

426
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:08,625
and for myself l'm pleased you concede

427
00:52:08,766 --> 00:52:11,701
this is something supernatural.

428
00:52:11,835 --> 00:52:15,669
l concede nothing, father.
l have only doubts.

429
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:18,635
anything to add?

430
00:52:19,943 --> 00:52:21,308
no, gentlemen.

431
00:52:23,213 --> 00:52:26,011
l've received this from paris.

432
00:52:27,217 --> 00:52:32,154
capt. duhamel his Majesty has been
informed of your ineffective efforts.

433
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:36,283
he requests you be
relieved of your duties.

434
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,787
you and your men
are to return to langogne at once.

435
00:52:41,532 --> 00:52:44,763
sir beauterne, Master at arms,
is on his way.

436
00:52:44,902 --> 00:52:48,394
his mandate is to kill
this ferocious wolf.

437
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:53,833
he alone is authorized to hunt
in the diocese.

438
00:52:55,345 --> 00:52:56,642
gentlemen.

439
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:10,922
then l'm forgiven?

440
00:53:11,395 --> 00:53:15,195
l was curious to know my ''totem''.
ls that the word?

441
00:53:15,332 --> 00:53:16,856
l would guess...

442
00:53:18,268 --> 00:53:19,462
mermaid.

443
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:23,733
are you never serious?
l'll ask your redskin.

444
00:53:25,042 --> 00:53:27,875
and the beast? have you spotted it?

445
00:53:29,213 --> 00:53:30,680
forbidden subject?

446
00:53:30,814 --> 00:53:35,251
My absurd assumptions would
get me laughed out of king's garden.

447
00:53:35,986 --> 00:53:39,922
lf l said the beast
is flesh and iron mixed,

448
00:53:40,457 --> 00:53:44,791
that it's possessed of reason
and may disappear at will,

449
00:53:44,928 --> 00:53:46,225
what would you say?

450
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:49,161
country air has affected your mind.

451
00:53:49,299 --> 00:53:50,926
lt's eluding me.

452
00:53:51,335 --> 00:53:55,135
after three months,
you expect to have finished?

453
00:53:55,272 --> 00:54:00,209
should the beast have surrendered?
perhaps it's afraid of you.

454
00:54:00,844 --> 00:54:02,471
am l so fearsome?

455
00:54:02,613 --> 00:54:05,810
a hard-won victory will be better savored.

456
00:54:08,352 --> 00:54:11,253
ls it true you're going to africa?

457
00:54:11,622 --> 00:54:15,285
for now it's but
a naturalist's winter dream.

458
00:54:15,425 --> 00:54:18,656
and you? ever yearn for new horizons?

459
00:54:20,597 --> 00:54:23,964
a lady has more duties than yearnings.

460
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:26,661
do you see sardis over there?

461
00:54:27,604 --> 00:54:29,196
are you being watched?

462
00:54:30,607 --> 00:54:32,302
he's there to protect me.

463
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:36,105
alone with you,
god knows what could happen.

464
00:54:36,613 --> 00:54:40,572
let's go inside.
our priest might catch cold.

465
00:54:51,428 --> 00:54:53,020
good evening, sir.

466
00:55:05,542 --> 00:55:08,534
- you're in love.
- l don't know.

467
00:55:09,079 --> 00:55:10,546
l do.

468
00:55:11,148 --> 00:55:12,410
the cards?

469
00:55:12,883 --> 00:55:15,647
l've never needed them for you.

470
00:55:17,287 --> 00:55:19,221
so let's drink.

471
00:55:21,091 --> 00:55:23,616
to Mademoiselle de Morangias.

472
00:55:25,028 --> 00:55:28,395
- what?
- her brother was here.

473
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,431
you slept with him?

474
00:55:33,337 --> 00:55:36,773
him? he can't stand to be touched.

475
00:55:37,808 --> 00:55:40,333
he watches, he drinks,

476
00:55:40,777 --> 00:55:44,577
then he talks in his sleep, like all men.

477
00:55:45,716 --> 00:55:47,149
do l?

478
00:55:48,852 --> 00:55:50,376
what do l say?

479
00:55:51,321 --> 00:55:52,788
''again !''

480
00:55:59,529 --> 00:56:03,727
know how florentine women
keep their husbands home?

481
00:56:06,803 --> 00:56:09,499
each morning, they give them

482
00:56:09,773 --> 00:56:12,241
a slow poison,

483
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:15,038
and every evening the antidote.

484
00:56:15,178 --> 00:56:18,614
that way, when the husband sleeps away

485
00:56:18,749 --> 00:56:20,910
he has a very bad night.

486
00:56:22,786 --> 00:56:25,050
you needn't resort to that.

487
00:56:29,626 --> 00:56:32,288
anyway, we aren't married.

488
00:57:58,515 --> 00:58:02,952
Make way for antoine de beauterne,
royal Master at arms,

489
00:58:03,086 --> 00:58:06,544
who has come to rid the country
of the beast!

490
00:58:26,977 --> 00:58:31,073
- l am gregoire de fronsac.
- yes, buffon's envoy.

491
00:58:31,214 --> 00:58:33,011
the naturalist embalmer.

492
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:37,211
M. de beauterne is at the lntendant's.
come at 2:00.

493
00:59:17,194 --> 00:59:21,153
his Majesty asked my advice
about your report.

494
00:59:22,265 --> 00:59:24,563
complicated fables indeed!

495
00:59:25,869 --> 00:59:29,032
l believe the beast is a wolf.

496
00:59:32,209 --> 00:59:35,201
l shall go out for it tomorrow.

497
00:59:35,345 --> 00:59:38,178
l would rather you didn't come.

498
00:59:41,585 --> 00:59:42,916
why is that?

499
00:59:44,521 --> 00:59:49,117
the king left this affair to me,
and to my sole discretion.

500
00:59:50,060 --> 00:59:52,824
l have no need of you to end it.

501
00:59:57,334 --> 01:00:02,203
on the table there's a letter
from buffon and our beloved king.

502
01:00:04,107 --> 01:00:07,975
l'm at his service,
but believe me this is not--

503
01:00:08,111 --> 01:00:12,548
l've read your report. trouble yourself
no longer with this beast.

504
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:14,274
lt's my affair.

505
01:00:16,419 --> 01:00:17,681
you may go.

506
01:00:23,527 --> 01:00:25,051
come here.

507
01:01:40,136 --> 01:01:44,004
a woman from lorxiere,
lt attaxked her xoming from the fair,

508
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:48,008
we lostitnear mt, mouxhet,
vanished in the wood,

509
01:01:48,345 --> 01:01:50,939
the beasthas struxk near st, alban,

510
01:01:51,081 --> 01:01:56,018
god haspunished me!
my xhildren vanished on mt, mouxhet!

511
01:02:03,927 --> 01:02:06,088
l don'tbelieve anymore than you in,,,

512
01:02:06,229 --> 01:02:09,630
lts snoutis longer,
its teeth are like knives,

513
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,130
my only xertaintyis that this is no wolf,

514
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:16,295
- the beastis no animal,
- a rabid wolf will attaxk,

515
01:02:16,439 --> 01:02:18,236
how do we xatxh it?

516
01:02:19,042 --> 01:02:21,101
no animal has iron fangs,

517
01:02:21,511 --> 01:02:23,536
sir, come at once!

518
01:02:26,316 --> 01:02:27,749
l saw him!

519
01:02:28,718 --> 01:02:33,246
he was dispensing poison
and saying satanic incantations!

520
01:02:34,157 --> 01:02:36,489
god only knows for how long!

521
01:02:48,338 --> 01:02:49,566
let him go.

522
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:53,742
an lndian remedy, father.

523
01:02:53,877 --> 01:02:56,437
only our prayers may save her.

524
01:02:57,781 --> 01:02:59,646
but she was...

525
01:03:00,383 --> 01:03:01,611
a miracle!

526
01:03:02,185 --> 01:03:04,881
what happened to your brother?

527
01:03:54,637 --> 01:03:59,074
- a man with the beast?
- the child is incoherent.

528
01:04:20,029 --> 01:04:22,020
yes, the beast is dead.

529
01:04:22,365 --> 01:04:24,629
no cure for 10 shots in the gut.

530
01:04:31,441 --> 01:04:34,968
we've brought your things. begin at once.

531
01:04:43,686 --> 01:04:46,416
- lt's not the beast.
- get to work!

532
01:04:46,589 --> 01:04:49,956
- ridiculous!
- M. de beauterne is coming.

533
01:04:50,093 --> 01:04:51,617
watch your lip!

534
01:04:51,795 --> 01:04:53,854
hello. leave us!

535
01:04:55,098 --> 01:04:57,589
don't you like my beast?

536
01:04:58,001 --> 01:05:02,062
what is this? you know it's not the beast.

537
01:05:02,205 --> 01:05:04,571
lts jaw is twice as large.

538
01:05:04,707 --> 01:05:06,971
you can fix that here.

539
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:08,142
what?

540
01:05:08,278 --> 01:05:13,147
paris awaits. l have only this wolf.
so make me a beast.

541
01:05:13,917 --> 01:05:16,818
- to fool the king?
- no, fronsac.

542
01:05:17,587 --> 01:05:22,217
l carry out his will.
you'd be wise to do the same.

543
01:05:24,060 --> 01:05:26,028
ls that a threat, sir?

544
01:05:26,229 --> 01:05:29,164
at my age? come now, you know me.

545
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:32,200
you're too smart for threats.

546
01:05:32,569 --> 01:05:35,936
do your duty, the king will be grateful.

547
01:05:36,072 --> 01:05:39,064
otherwise, he'll be quite upset.

548
01:05:39,442 --> 01:05:42,843
you have what you need.
l'm counting on you.

549
01:05:42,979 --> 01:05:44,810
good-bye for now.

550
01:08:26,509 --> 01:08:29,535
good evening, my unhappy friend.

551
01:08:33,049 --> 01:08:36,075
are you sad to be returning to paris?

552
01:08:36,219 --> 01:08:39,586
the beast is dead. you should be happy.

553
01:08:40,223 --> 01:08:43,158
do you want me to tell you a secret?

554
01:08:43,292 --> 01:08:45,021
l collect them.

555
01:08:46,996 --> 01:08:51,296
beauterne killed a simple wolf.
he is an impostor.

556
01:08:51,434 --> 01:08:53,664
and l am his accomplice.

557
01:08:55,538 --> 01:08:59,269
come, let's drink to our betrayals.

558
01:09:37,013 --> 01:09:38,708
you saw nothing.

559
01:09:59,769 --> 01:10:02,602
you are no longer welcome
at the castle, sir!

560
01:10:02,972 --> 01:10:06,271
tell Mademoiselle de Morangias
that l am here!

561
01:10:06,409 --> 01:10:09,310
- l've already told you--
- speak of the devil!

562
01:10:09,445 --> 01:10:13,074
My son and l were just
talking about you, sir.

563
01:10:13,216 --> 01:10:15,741
lt is your daughter l have come to visit.

564
01:10:15,885 --> 01:10:18,615
- l'm afraid that is impossible.
- l insist.

565
01:10:18,754 --> 01:10:20,915
let him come in, Mother.

566
01:10:24,627 --> 01:10:28,427
be careful, jean-francois,
you know how these matters end.

567
01:10:28,564 --> 01:10:29,724
leave us.

568
01:10:32,969 --> 01:10:36,370
sir, Marianne is suffering.

569
01:10:38,608 --> 01:10:40,235
l don't understand.

570
01:10:43,813 --> 01:10:48,648
however, fronsac,
you are not a stranger to what ails her.

571
01:10:49,152 --> 01:10:50,176
where is she?

572
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:54,786
follow me.

573
01:10:58,194 --> 01:11:00,321
so kind of you to visit.

574
01:11:00,997 --> 01:11:03,397
Mademoiselle, what ails you?

575
01:11:03,533 --> 01:11:06,331
l am to return to paris,
but that depends on you.

576
01:11:06,469 --> 01:11:08,266
have a safe journey.

577
01:11:12,675 --> 01:11:14,666
l warned you, fronsac.

578
01:11:16,112 --> 01:11:18,478
you have offered me only one present,

579
01:11:18,614 --> 01:11:22,448
and here l give you two
for your collection.

580
01:11:25,488 --> 01:11:28,924
l've been warned about men of your kind.

581
01:11:29,659 --> 01:11:31,422
Men of my kind, mademoiselle,

582
01:11:31,594 --> 01:11:34,995
never condemn people
without having listened to them.

583
01:11:35,131 --> 01:11:38,328
l don't know how this happened,
but let me explain.

584
01:11:38,467 --> 01:11:40,230
you needn't bother.

585
01:11:41,537 --> 01:11:45,473
please, sir, don't make this
more difficult than it already is.

586
01:11:47,677 --> 01:11:51,306
admit that you were not
the man for my sister,

587
01:11:51,447 --> 01:11:54,177
and leave it at that, no regrets.

588
01:11:54,650 --> 01:11:59,383
do you believe that she will remain
your nursemaid all her life?

589
01:12:03,392 --> 01:12:07,590
are you not happy
to leave our province in one piece?

590
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:11,222
ln other times, l would have you flogged
for looking at her.

591
01:12:12,501 --> 01:12:13,593
times change.

592
01:12:14,337 --> 01:12:18,330
not everywhere, fronsac.
ln any case, not here.

593
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:24,439
l'm sorry!

594
01:12:25,014 --> 01:12:28,313
will you hit me too
if l tell you to leave?

595
01:12:29,418 --> 01:12:30,612
good-bye.

596
01:12:33,322 --> 01:12:35,790
have no regrets. he didn't deserve you.

597
01:12:38,894 --> 01:12:43,388
on this historix day,
thanks be to sir gregoire de fronsax

598
01:12:43,532 --> 01:12:45,193
ofking's garden,

599
01:12:45,401 --> 01:12:48,336
the beast's end ispartlyhis,

600
01:12:49,905 --> 01:12:53,306
but it is mostly thanks to your Majesty.

601
01:12:53,609 --> 01:12:55,201
let it be known :

602
01:12:56,345 --> 01:13:00,042
ln your sole person
resides sovereign power.

603
01:13:03,586 --> 01:13:06,020
only a beast could ignore it.

604
01:13:06,188 --> 01:13:08,179
that beast is no more.

605
01:13:08,724 --> 01:13:11,386
l have only little merit.

606
01:13:12,128 --> 01:13:16,428
with your power bestowed upon me,
l merely needed to appear,

607
01:13:16,666 --> 01:13:19,726
and the beast laid down its arms.

608
01:13:28,177 --> 01:13:29,701
what is this?

609
01:13:29,845 --> 01:13:33,872
beauterne's carried out his orders,
as we all should.

610
01:13:34,016 --> 01:13:36,007
- what orders?
- Mine.

611
01:13:38,087 --> 01:13:40,749
this is M. Mercier,

612
01:13:41,257 --> 01:13:45,159
special counsel to his Majesty
for domestic matters.

613
01:13:45,728 --> 01:13:49,323
lt was his idea
to send antoine de beauterne.

614
01:13:50,032 --> 01:13:53,092
you're to thank for this prompt victory?

615
01:13:53,235 --> 01:13:56,500
l admire your scruples,
but it's for the greater good.

616
01:13:57,306 --> 01:13:58,637
have you read this?

617
01:14:00,409 --> 01:14:03,503
lt's no longer for sale,
but you may keep it.

618
01:14:04,146 --> 01:14:05,204
lt was banned?

619
01:14:05,348 --> 01:14:07,942
a fable undermining the king.

620
01:14:08,184 --> 01:14:12,416
we'd have had trouble if we waited longer.
people are so gullible.

621
01:14:12,788 --> 01:14:17,316
better to lie than let lies be spread?

622
01:14:18,494 --> 01:14:23,397
truth is a complicated thing.
one must govern with simplicity.

623
01:14:23,933 --> 01:14:26,663
no more beast, no more problem.

624
01:14:26,969 --> 01:14:28,163
lt'll go on killing.

625
01:14:28,304 --> 01:14:31,899
no one will hear of it again.
that's what counts.

626
01:14:32,041 --> 01:14:36,239
l was forgetting.
his Majesty is most thankful.

627
01:14:36,379 --> 01:14:39,143
lt's said you want to go to africa.

628
01:14:39,281 --> 01:14:42,842
ln six months,
a schooner sets sail for senegal.

629
01:14:43,886 --> 01:14:46,946
lf you wish, you'll be aboard.

630
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:52,587
of course, we'll never speak
of gevaudan again.

631
01:14:54,230 --> 01:14:55,697
well, fronsac?

632
01:18:22,338 --> 01:18:24,238
Marianne de Morangias?

633
01:18:25,107 --> 01:18:28,736
Madame, l don't believe l know you.

634
01:18:30,646 --> 01:18:34,844
we both have a friend in common.

635
01:18:36,518 --> 01:18:38,145
what are you doing here?

636
01:18:38,287 --> 01:18:40,585
lt's useless to hide behind that veil.

637
01:18:41,256 --> 01:18:43,520
your perfume is not that of a lady.

638
01:18:46,295 --> 01:18:49,787
gregoire de fronsac
has only loved one woman.

639
01:18:49,965 --> 01:18:53,196
lt is your name
he calls out in his sleep.

640
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:57,331
he will soon be leaving on a long journey.

641
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,805
just perfect.

642
01:19:01,644 --> 01:19:06,445
when you see fronsac,
do not tell him anything of our meeting,

643
01:19:06,849 --> 01:19:09,374
or you will lose him forever.

644
01:19:22,164 --> 01:19:24,325
who was that, my child?

645
01:19:25,501 --> 01:19:26,627
no one.

646
01:19:53,295 --> 01:19:56,628
that one, in the hold with the others.

647
01:19:57,533 --> 01:20:01,663
these two, in my cabin.
be careful, they're fragile!

648
01:20:01,804 --> 01:20:03,135
hello, fronsac!

649
01:20:03,539 --> 01:20:04,938
hey, Marquis!

650
01:20:08,143 --> 01:20:09,667
good to see you !

651
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:12,037
not as good as all that.

652
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:15,714
two days after you left,
the crimes began again.

653
01:20:15,851 --> 01:20:19,844
the king no longer sends soldiers.
l can't find volunteers for the hunt.

654
01:20:19,988 --> 01:20:23,014
l can't do a thing.
l don't know how to catch it.

655
01:20:23,192 --> 01:20:26,787
frankly, it wasn't entirely
your talents l was thinking of.

656
01:20:26,962 --> 01:20:28,896
Mani found the child.

657
01:20:29,164 --> 01:20:32,656
just one hunt, fronsac!
you'll be back within the month.

658
01:20:32,801 --> 01:20:36,134
lmpossible! the king has forbidden us
from returning.

659
01:20:36,271 --> 01:20:38,739
- the king will not know.
- so you think.

660
01:20:38,874 --> 01:20:42,435
ls the king's peace of mind
worth all these sacrifices?

661
01:20:42,578 --> 01:20:44,910
you won't change my mind.

662
01:20:45,881 --> 01:20:50,477
- do you want to bet?
- the last time we made a bet, you lost!

663
01:20:51,186 --> 01:20:53,416
l would have preferred not to use this,

664
01:20:53,555 --> 01:20:56,285
but, here, it's from Marianne.

665
01:20:56,892 --> 01:20:58,086
and Mani?

666
01:21:02,598 --> 01:21:04,031
My friend!

667
01:21:12,674 --> 01:21:13,902
how are you?

668
01:21:16,912 --> 01:21:21,076
- we're leaving for the hunt, Mani.
- this time, we'll do it your way.

669
01:21:22,184 --> 01:21:24,175
so, my friend, any good news?

670
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:28,881
best in the world, Marquis.

671
01:21:34,897 --> 01:21:38,025
ln gevaudan, the crimes continued,

672
01:21:38,867 --> 01:21:41,734
but offixially, the beast was dead,

673
01:21:42,471 --> 01:21:46,464
whatreallyhappened
appears in no historybook,

674
01:21:47,242 --> 01:21:49,642
lt was xarefullykept quiet,

675
01:21:53,849 --> 01:21:55,840
ls he welcoming us?

676
01:21:55,984 --> 01:21:57,952
he wants to help us.

677
01:22:01,023 --> 01:22:04,186
go to the castle. l'll meet you there.

678
01:22:34,022 --> 01:22:35,182
what is it?

679
01:22:43,832 --> 01:22:46,232
where do jeanne and pierre roulier live?

680
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:49,834
go straight on.
lt's the last house in the village.

681
01:23:53,468 --> 01:23:56,596
this is jeanne, my nanny.

682
01:23:59,141 --> 01:24:01,268
pierre, fetch some wine.

683
01:24:15,157 --> 01:24:18,149
l'm being watched.
they might know you're back.

684
01:24:18,327 --> 01:24:20,852
l'll tear you away from your family.

685
01:24:35,444 --> 01:24:38,902
l can't bear my mother, nor jean-francois.

686
01:24:39,181 --> 01:24:40,739
l want to leave.

687
01:24:41,249 --> 01:24:43,444
ln a week, we'll go to paris.

688
01:24:43,585 --> 01:24:44,847
why wait?

689
01:24:45,620 --> 01:24:48,680
the hunt. l promised the Marquis.

690
01:24:48,824 --> 01:24:50,758
you didn't return for me?

691
01:25:18,186 --> 01:25:19,380
look out!

692
01:25:31,500 --> 01:25:34,526
leave! slowly, don't run !

693
01:25:35,404 --> 01:25:37,099
over here! look at me!

694
01:25:37,239 --> 01:25:39,230
come here!

695
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:56,818
go, Marianne!

696
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:39,167
what is this? open up!

697
01:26:43,171 --> 01:26:44,103
My god!

698
01:27:28,817 --> 01:27:32,719
tell me, do you really think
we'll find this beast?

699
01:27:32,854 --> 01:27:34,845
we're short of men.

700
01:27:34,956 --> 01:27:37,857
Mani knows what he's doing.
l'm hunting a man.

701
01:27:41,496 --> 01:27:42,554
a man?

702
01:27:43,365 --> 01:27:46,994
the beast is a weapon serving a sick mind.

703
01:27:47,836 --> 01:27:50,464
- wouldn't a killer be secretive?
- right.

704
01:27:50,639 --> 01:27:53,437
the beast's first mystery is its fame.

705
01:27:55,110 --> 01:27:58,944
lts master wants people to talk,
to be afraid and make noise.

706
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:00,172
how's that?

707
01:28:00,715 --> 01:28:02,307
this book is sold all over.

708
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:10,223
lt says the beast is punishing
the king's indulgence in philosophers.

709
01:28:11,426 --> 01:28:12,950
who wrote it?

710
01:28:13,128 --> 01:28:16,222
l don't know,
but the beast has a master. l want him.

711
01:28:37,085 --> 01:28:39,815
perhaps your weapon will help...

712
01:28:40,422 --> 01:28:42,287
but only in your hands!

713
01:28:42,991 --> 01:28:44,390
and you, Mani?

714
01:28:45,093 --> 01:28:46,685
which will you choose?

715
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:49,392
Mani doesn't like firearms.

716
01:28:49,898 --> 01:28:53,800
too much noise and smoke. bad smell.

717
01:29:15,290 --> 01:29:17,884
all will go well, grandfather.

718
01:29:19,794 --> 01:29:22,627
don't worry. we're well prepared.

719
01:31:36,531 --> 01:31:38,590
tell me of the americas.

720
01:31:42,070 --> 01:31:43,662
will you never go back?

721
01:31:45,607 --> 01:31:47,575
not all my memories are fond ones.

722
01:31:48,009 --> 01:31:50,773
and Mani? does he miss his tribe?

723
01:31:51,312 --> 01:31:53,280
his tribe is no more.

724
01:31:53,915 --> 01:31:58,318
before our attack,
the pox had decimated his village.

725
01:31:58,453 --> 01:32:01,149
orders were to execute survivors.

726
01:32:01,289 --> 01:32:04,122
the women, and the children, too.

727
01:32:04,192 --> 01:32:05,716
only Mani escaped.

728
01:32:06,694 --> 01:32:09,891
- how?
- we needed an interpreter.

729
01:32:10,498 --> 01:32:15,299
l was to teach him our language.
then l found him slaying the captain.

730
01:32:15,837 --> 01:32:17,964
why didn't you turn him in?

731
01:32:18,473 --> 01:32:20,805
know how the captain waged battle?

732
01:32:21,609 --> 01:32:25,340
he gave his scouts
infected hospital sheets.

733
01:32:26,214 --> 01:32:30,674
the lroquois bought them.
three weeks later, we'd mop up.

734
01:32:30,819 --> 01:32:34,846
- and that's our war?
- ln any case, that is how we lost.

735
01:32:38,660 --> 01:32:40,184
where did he go?

736
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:44,126
- to speak to the trees.
- trees?

737
01:32:44,466 --> 01:32:45,797
trees can speak.

738
01:32:48,102 --> 01:32:51,936
the white man cannot listen or see.

739
01:32:52,707 --> 01:32:54,072
see what, Mani?

740
01:33:00,949 --> 01:33:02,348
want to learn?

741
01:33:02,851 --> 01:33:05,684
- what's this?
- an lndian sacrament.

742
01:33:06,187 --> 01:33:08,655
at your own risk, Marquis.

743
01:33:12,460 --> 01:33:15,429
- what's it do?
- depends on the person.

744
01:33:17,599 --> 01:33:20,033
they say they see the invisible.

745
01:33:22,003 --> 01:33:23,095
so, Mani?

746
01:33:23,738 --> 01:33:27,196
the beast is in the forest.
the wolves will help us.

747
01:33:27,342 --> 01:33:28,604
l see no better.

748
01:33:28,743 --> 01:33:32,679
this night we shall dance
the dance of blood.

749
01:33:34,449 --> 01:33:38,317
and the beast shall come to us
with the sun.

750
01:33:39,187 --> 01:33:40,677
lt has no effect on me.

751
01:33:47,061 --> 01:33:50,360
thatnight, mani invoked spirits

752
01:33:50,498 --> 01:33:54,662
in a language
even fronsax xouldn't understand,

753
01:33:54,969 --> 01:33:57,904
and the wolves brought them to the beast,

754
01:37:06,995 --> 01:37:10,226
don't worry, l'll fix this for you.

755
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:41,943
don't worry, girl. l'll see to you.

756
01:38:42,654 --> 01:38:45,145
l'll take care of you.

757
01:43:30,208 --> 01:43:34,042
thomas is asleep. a close call.

758
01:43:35,247 --> 01:43:37,442
l'm sorry for the lndian.

759
01:43:37,749 --> 01:43:38,977
what is there?

760
01:43:39,418 --> 01:43:42,819
tell me, what manor is this?
l need to know.

761
01:43:42,954 --> 01:43:46,253
lt's a domain. a hunting ground.

762
01:43:49,327 --> 01:43:51,591
sir, you need rest.

763
01:45:47,345 --> 01:45:48,812
hurry! fire!

764
01:50:00,799 --> 01:50:03,029
he's over there! come on !

765
01:50:27,592 --> 01:50:30,390
fronsax returned by mani's side,

766
01:50:30,695 --> 01:50:33,289
his revenge had hardlybegun,

767
01:50:33,565 --> 01:50:35,829
but axxording to lndian xustom,

768
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:40,494
he mustbe sent to his anxestors
at dawn's firstlight,

769
01:50:46,411 --> 01:50:47,878
what do you want?

770
01:50:49,247 --> 01:50:52,045
too much blood has been spilled.

771
01:50:52,350 --> 01:50:54,511
you're in great peril here.

772
01:50:55,587 --> 01:50:58,181
l have business to attend to.

773
01:50:58,823 --> 01:51:00,723
ls it worth your life?

774
01:51:03,094 --> 01:51:05,187
how long have you known?

775
01:51:06,097 --> 01:51:07,894
l don't know what you mean.

776
01:51:08,032 --> 01:51:10,500
come now, sardis. how?

777
01:51:12,003 --> 01:51:14,267
how did it get this far?

778
01:51:15,406 --> 01:51:17,431
no one will believe you.

779
01:51:19,944 --> 01:51:21,377
go away, sardis.

780
01:51:23,848 --> 01:51:25,247
May god save you.

781
01:51:27,151 --> 01:51:29,119
May the devil take you.

782
01:51:50,408 --> 01:51:55,141
you're under arrest
by order of the lntendant.

783
01:51:55,280 --> 01:51:57,407
please offer no resistance.

784
01:51:57,548 --> 01:51:58,606
that's ridiculous!

785
01:52:35,787 --> 01:52:38,654
- a lady to see you.
- later. tonight.

786
01:52:47,765 --> 01:52:50,165
get up! you've got company.

787
01:52:50,335 --> 01:52:54,738
- aren't l in solitary confinement?
- depends for whom.

788
01:53:05,016 --> 01:53:06,040
sorry.

789
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:11,445
bring your guest some dinner.

790
01:53:14,525 --> 01:53:17,494
- how?
- Many owe me favors.

791
01:53:18,796 --> 01:53:21,560
help me. l must write to the king.

792
01:53:23,067 --> 01:53:26,366
you'd be hung before he read your letter.

793
01:53:26,704 --> 01:53:28,831
l've yet to stand trial.

794
01:53:29,574 --> 01:53:30,666
here.

795
01:53:37,949 --> 01:53:41,316
- tell me of the beast.
- a trained animal.

796
01:53:41,652 --> 01:53:44,416
cloaked in armor. l wounded it.

797
01:53:47,658 --> 01:53:49,751
why the sudden interest?

798
01:53:49,894 --> 01:53:50,952
two years ago,

799
01:53:51,763 --> 01:53:56,359
a confidential letter from sardis
was given to the pope.

800
01:53:56,768 --> 01:54:00,260
lt spoke of a newly founded
secret society

801
01:54:00,772 --> 01:54:03,673
whose purpose was to spread

802
01:54:03,808 --> 01:54:07,642
and defend, by any means,
the word of the church.

803
01:54:08,846 --> 01:54:10,473
the brotherhood.

804
01:54:10,848 --> 01:54:14,443
sardis, he was using the beast.

805
01:54:17,555 --> 01:54:21,047
the beast is a warning to the king:

806
01:54:22,393 --> 01:54:26,261
''heed the power of the lord
or suffer apocalypse.''

807
01:54:26,898 --> 01:54:30,163
Members are known as ''wolves of god.''

808
01:54:32,503 --> 01:54:34,300
lt serves the church?

809
01:54:39,677 --> 01:54:44,614
sardis serves only himself.
these wild times have made him mad.

810
01:54:44,816 --> 01:54:47,842
the group is beyond rome's control.

811
01:54:52,423 --> 01:54:54,152
ln whose employ are you?

812
01:54:54,292 --> 01:54:58,058
My duties include
never letting that be known.

813
01:55:05,770 --> 01:55:08,637
and you, you know quite enough.

814
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:22,542
Mademoiselle de Morangias, what an honor.

815
01:55:22,787 --> 01:55:26,348
how fares the countess? please sit down.

816
01:55:28,993 --> 01:55:31,723
and your father? still in cure?

817
01:55:32,697 --> 01:55:35,257
he's too fond of rich food.

818
01:55:36,767 --> 01:55:39,292
sir, you've arrested fronsac.

819
01:55:41,339 --> 01:55:44,035
how far a man such as he has fallen !

820
01:55:44,242 --> 01:55:47,803
- he's neither thief nor murderer.
- really?

821
01:55:48,279 --> 01:55:51,737
hear me, he must have had his reasons.

822
01:55:51,949 --> 01:55:56,147
- lf they killed the lndian--
- that's another matter.

823
01:55:56,821 --> 01:56:01,281
you don't avenge a savage
with christian blood.

824
01:56:03,761 --> 01:56:05,228
May l visit him?

825
01:56:16,374 --> 01:56:17,534
lmpossible.

826
01:56:19,944 --> 01:56:21,002
very well.

827
01:56:21,946 --> 01:56:24,312
paris shall hear of this.

828
01:56:24,849 --> 01:56:26,441
you don't understand.

829
01:56:26,584 --> 01:56:28,484
fronsac passed away...

830
01:56:29,787 --> 01:56:30,811
last night.

831
01:56:44,468 --> 01:56:47,369
ln any case, they'd have hung him.

832
01:56:47,905 --> 01:56:50,601
upon reflection, he was lucky.

833
01:56:51,642 --> 01:56:53,610
he was in your custody.

834
01:56:54,879 --> 01:56:56,369
perhaps he choked.

835
01:56:56,914 --> 01:56:59,610
or he caught a blight in the mattress.

836
01:56:59,750 --> 01:57:02,981
you're lying. you're all lying!

837
01:57:04,689 --> 01:57:08,090
courage, child, it's the will of god.

838
01:57:11,462 --> 01:57:12,656
come.

839
01:57:12,830 --> 01:57:16,527
- l'll escort you home.
- she needs rest.

840
01:57:20,371 --> 01:57:22,498
- let me alone!
- lt's over.

841
01:57:27,345 --> 01:57:32,180
he's already reeking.
bury him quickly in an unmarked grave.

842
01:57:33,084 --> 01:57:37,851
she threatened to go to the king.
that girl is dangerous.

843
01:57:43,628 --> 01:57:46,495
fronsax was buried that verynight,

844
01:57:47,265 --> 01:57:51,031
long before news ofhis death
reaxhed paris,

845
01:57:51,969 --> 01:57:56,201
no one knew what sexrets
he took to his grave,

846
01:57:58,209 --> 01:58:01,940
for several days,
the beast did not strike,

847
01:58:02,913 --> 01:58:06,815
but the sudden disappearanxe
ofits most dauntless foe

848
01:58:06,951 --> 01:58:09,010
seemed to be a dark omen,

849
01:58:31,108 --> 01:58:32,132
hurry.

850
01:58:40,017 --> 01:58:43,043
father, l'm guilty. l have sinned.

851
01:58:43,487 --> 01:58:44,818
forgive me.

852
01:58:45,956 --> 01:58:49,357
Marianne, day and night l think of her.

853
01:58:50,227 --> 01:58:53,355
l hear her heart beating in my chest.

854
01:58:54,565 --> 01:58:57,363
l want her on our side, sardis.

855
01:58:57,501 --> 01:59:01,460
- the lord is testing you.
- l can't endure it.

856
01:59:05,009 --> 01:59:06,101
the visions!

857
01:59:08,946 --> 01:59:12,074
these accursed visions torment me!

858
01:59:15,419 --> 01:59:17,250
deliver me, father!

859
01:59:18,155 --> 01:59:20,089
l beg of you !

860
01:59:22,093 --> 01:59:24,960
there's only one remedy for this evil.

861
02:00:29,093 --> 02:00:30,958
don't drink, sister.

862
02:00:33,097 --> 02:00:35,065
they want to kill you.

863
02:00:36,434 --> 02:00:38,299
but l won't let them.

864
02:00:40,137 --> 02:00:41,627
who does?

865
02:00:43,607 --> 02:00:44,665
who?

866
02:00:46,544 --> 02:00:49,911
we're going to leave, just you and me.

867
02:00:51,182 --> 02:00:52,979
how about america?

868
02:00:55,252 --> 02:00:58,244
you've hurt me, but l forgive you.

869
02:01:04,328 --> 02:01:07,491
please. what are you doing?

870
02:01:08,532 --> 02:01:09,590
stay.

871
02:01:14,638 --> 02:01:18,574
- would l harm you?
- please stay away from me.

872
02:01:20,611 --> 02:01:22,442
l need you.

873
02:01:23,113 --> 02:01:26,776
you saved me when l was sick, no one else.

874
02:01:27,318 --> 02:01:30,048
the sight of your face
ended my nightmares.

875
02:01:30,187 --> 02:01:32,485
your hand on my brow chased away demons.

876
02:01:32,623 --> 02:01:35,524
you can't imagine all l've done
to keep you near.

877
02:01:35,659 --> 02:01:38,389
l beg of you, don't shun me.

878
02:01:46,770 --> 02:01:48,032
why?

879
02:01:52,376 --> 02:01:53,809
do l disgust you?

880
02:01:53,978 --> 02:01:56,742
you don't frighten me. get out.

881
02:01:59,416 --> 02:02:00,906
because of this?

882
02:02:06,891 --> 02:02:08,256
never fear.

883
02:02:09,660 --> 02:02:12,686
from now on, l'll take care of you.

884
02:02:14,098 --> 02:02:15,030
look.

885
02:02:16,800 --> 02:02:19,894
no one knows. only sardis and l.

886
02:02:35,819 --> 02:02:38,117
leave! get out!

887
02:02:40,057 --> 02:02:41,217
why?

888
02:02:43,894 --> 02:02:45,862
you're not my brother.

889
02:02:46,597 --> 02:02:49,395
another man returned from africa.

890
02:02:49,533 --> 02:02:52,900
that's true, but it was for you l left.

891
02:02:54,638 --> 02:02:57,368
all this would not be, if not for you.

892
02:02:57,541 --> 02:02:58,508
all this?

893
02:03:08,686 --> 02:03:13,521
lt's your odor
that foul thing smelled on me.

894
02:03:16,427 --> 02:03:19,885
we're of the same blood.

895
02:03:23,033 --> 02:03:26,696
when father comes back, he'll kill you !

896
02:03:29,139 --> 02:03:33,200
unless l kill him?
he's hindered us so long.

897
02:03:34,778 --> 02:03:37,838
go ahead. do it, go ahead!

898
02:04:02,206 --> 02:04:03,696
why didn't you?

899
02:04:05,109 --> 02:04:07,043
ls it so difficult? look.

900
02:04:07,211 --> 02:04:09,406
- stop!
- then you love me?

901
02:04:16,854 --> 02:04:18,685
l love you !

902
02:04:23,560 --> 02:04:26,893
brothers, the lord has told me

903
02:04:27,531 --> 02:04:29,590
the beast will return

904
02:04:29,733 --> 02:04:34,193
to herald the return of values
to our decadent kingdom.

905
02:04:34,738 --> 02:04:37,332
and in a reborn france

906
02:04:37,841 --> 02:04:42,210
we shall be invisible princes,
for god is with us.

907
02:04:55,225 --> 02:04:58,353
thepeople xannot fathom the lord's wrath,

908
02:04:58,796 --> 02:05:01,526
the unjust censure of the king

909
02:05:02,466 --> 02:05:05,799
cannot withstand the public's rage.

910
02:05:06,437 --> 02:05:08,928
when that wrath is at a climax,

911
02:05:09,106 --> 02:05:11,870
we'll bargain with the king.

912
02:05:12,242 --> 02:05:14,039
lf he couldn't repress one,

913
02:05:14,178 --> 02:05:18,842
imagine if, from all over the realm,

914
02:05:18,982 --> 02:05:21,212
other beasts burst forth.

915
02:05:23,120 --> 02:05:26,988
the hour is at hand
to reap what we've sewn.

916
02:05:30,527 --> 02:05:32,791
let us read from Malachi:

917
02:05:33,664 --> 02:05:37,998
''the word of the priest
is the depository of science,

918
02:05:38,302 --> 02:05:42,534
''and from his mouth is sought
knowledge of the law,

919
02:05:43,273 --> 02:05:46,333
''for he is the angel
of the lord of hosts.''

920
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:48,910
''he who adores the beast

921
02:05:50,514 --> 02:05:52,914
''shall drink the lord's wrath.

922
02:05:53,383 --> 02:05:57,615
''he shall be tormented
in the fire and brimstone

923
02:05:57,755 --> 02:05:59,245
''before the angels,

924
02:05:59,389 --> 02:06:03,519
''and the smoke shall rise
in the century of centuries.''

925
02:06:04,461 --> 02:06:06,691
l've come back to name you :

926
02:06:06,997 --> 02:06:10,728
pierre-jean laffont.
genevieve de Morangias.

927
02:06:11,268 --> 02:06:12,758
Maxime des forets.

928
02:06:13,303 --> 02:06:16,739
gontrand de Moncan. henri sardis.

929
02:06:17,641 --> 02:06:20,474
jean-francois de Morangias.

930
02:06:22,312 --> 02:06:23,244
amen !

931
02:08:10,587 --> 02:08:11,713
fire!

932
02:08:22,566 --> 02:08:26,332
bastards! you're all under arrest!

933
02:09:16,987 --> 02:09:18,682
ghost or no ghost...

934
02:09:20,691 --> 02:09:22,215
l'll split you in two.

935
02:09:34,805 --> 02:09:37,069
see? no need to hold back.

936
02:09:37,841 --> 02:09:39,331
l never intended to.

937
02:09:39,509 --> 02:09:42,876
too late. the beast is immortal now.

938
02:09:43,013 --> 02:09:45,277
perhaps, but you are not!

939
02:10:36,933 --> 02:10:40,027
- you trained the beast.
- how'd you know?

940
02:10:40,537 --> 02:10:42,505
you use silver bullets.

941
02:11:38,562 --> 02:11:40,826
Marianne, look!

942
02:11:54,044 --> 02:11:56,410
Marianne's not here, madman.

943
02:11:57,114 --> 02:11:59,275
you've united us forever.

944
02:12:29,246 --> 02:12:31,009
line the bastards up!

945
02:12:31,314 --> 02:12:32,747
who do you think you are?

946
02:12:34,818 --> 02:12:36,581
look at them!

947
02:12:37,554 --> 02:12:40,079
not so high and mighty now!

948
02:12:40,290 --> 02:12:41,814
get back!

949
02:13:01,878 --> 02:13:04,438
- he's dead.
- now it's certain.

950
02:13:06,449 --> 02:13:07,609
and sardis?

951
02:13:08,518 --> 02:13:13,455
wherever he runs, we'll find him.
or the mountain will take him.

952
02:13:16,626 --> 02:13:19,117
shall we celebrate properly?

953
02:13:19,763 --> 02:13:21,697
you've killed me once.

954
02:13:22,632 --> 02:13:24,862
the better to revive you.

955
02:13:26,870 --> 02:13:31,671
l could introduce you in rome.
will you come with me?

956
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:37,672
too late.

957
02:13:38,415 --> 02:13:42,852
l like you, fronsac.
you make me forget all my duties.

958
02:13:53,697 --> 02:13:56,495
leave, before l change my mind.

959
02:15:30,226 --> 02:15:34,128
- Marquis, what is it?
- Marianne.

960
02:15:34,731 --> 02:15:38,132
l've had her brought home. she's dying.

961
02:15:42,605 --> 02:15:45,733
get out! go away! all of you !

962
02:16:00,457 --> 02:16:02,152
wake up!

963
02:16:07,831 --> 02:16:09,662
forgive me.

964
02:16:15,071 --> 02:16:16,333
l love you.

965
02:17:44,461 --> 02:17:48,397
yearspassed,
but gregoire de fronsax

966
02:17:48,531 --> 02:17:52,695
and marianne de morangias
neverleftmymemory,

967
02:17:52,902 --> 02:17:56,463
the world thatmade the beast
is dying away,

968
02:17:57,874 --> 02:18:02,709
and l musthasten,
formy story, too, is ending,

969
02:18:11,921 --> 02:18:16,756
l remember fronsax and l
atjean-francois'hideaway

970
02:18:17,594 --> 02:18:20,961
where the beast awaited its final hour,

971
02:20:02,365 --> 02:20:05,425
the old healer told us all he knew,

972
02:20:06,803 --> 02:20:10,170
jean-francois brought
an animal baxk from afrixa,

973
02:20:10,306 --> 02:20:11,864
who had a litter,

974
02:20:12,342 --> 02:20:15,778
only one xub was kept, the strongest,

975
02:20:17,213 --> 02:20:19,647
patiently and xruelly,

976
02:20:20,516 --> 02:20:23,781
he'd trained it to be vixious,

977
02:20:34,163 --> 02:20:37,132
thus died the beast ofgevaudan,

978
02:20:38,101 --> 02:20:40,626
and l, thomas d'apxher,

979
02:20:41,204 --> 02:20:44,970
am probably the last to know
the whole truth,

980
02:21:19,108 --> 02:21:22,134
the chevalierinvited me to afrixa,

981
02:21:22,745 --> 02:21:24,679
butmyland needed rebuilding,

982
02:21:24,814 --> 02:21:27,305
my duty was to my xountrymen,

983
02:21:28,751 --> 02:21:31,845
l've often thought
ofgregoire and marianne

984
02:21:31,988 --> 02:21:36,789
throughout thesepeaxeful years
thathave broughtme to this age,

985
02:21:38,761 --> 02:21:40,888
l never saw them again,

986
02:21:41,864 --> 02:21:46,460
but l like to think theylived happily,
far from here,

987
02:23:22,865 --> 02:23:28,735
brotherhood of the wolf
