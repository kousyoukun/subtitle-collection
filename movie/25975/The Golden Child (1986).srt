Don't let him touch you.

Haahh!

welcome to
the Mel Bachman journal.

38
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:19,266
I'm Mel Bachman,

39
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,203
and here with me today
is Chandler Jarrell,

40
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,905
who is doing something
very vital for the community

41
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:28,008
because Chandler is
a finder of lost children.

42
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,943
Am I correct?

43
00:08:29,977 --> 00:08:31,945
Yes. I find
missing children.

44
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,981
That...that's
very interesting.

45
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,618
There was a show called
finder of lost loves.

46
00:08:37,651 --> 00:08:38,952
Ever see that?

47
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:41,021
Tony Franciosa
was the star.

48
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:42,590
Uh, yeah.

49
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,592
I'm looking
for this girl--

50
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,594
I hope you're
not nervous,

51
00:08:46,627 --> 00:08:48,596
which is
perfectly normal.

52
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:51,599
This is my fifth show,
and I'm still nervous.

53
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:54,968
In fact, is there anyone
here who's not nervous?

54
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:57,605
I'm trying to
find Cheryl Mosely.

55
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,006
She disappeared
a while back--

56
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,574
this is wonderful.

57
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,610
Because this is
exactly what

58
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:05,579
the Mel Bachman report
is all about.

59
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:07,915
When I came
to rst cable,

60
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:12,953
I told them I don't want
to be another merv,
another Johnny.

61
00:09:12,986 --> 00:09:15,589
I want to do
vital programming

62
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,591
that's responsive
to the community.

63
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:20,027
I'm trying to
find this girl.

64
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,895
She's 4'11" and--

65
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:24,765
this is wonderful.

66
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:28,602
Let's say I want
to get into your
line of work.

67
00:09:28,636 --> 00:09:30,838
Is there a course
I can take?

68
00:09:30,871 --> 00:09:33,707
All you have to do is
care about children.

69
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:35,943
Do you recommend
this line of work?

70
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:39,246
Can you make a lot
of money doing this?

71
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,849
Her name is
Cheryl Mosely. She's--

72
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,851
this is off
the subject,

73
00:09:43,884 --> 00:09:45,919
but that's
a wonderful, unique hat.

74
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:47,821
Where did you get that?

75
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,858
She's 16,
and I'm trying
to find her.

76
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:53,260
Great. Say you
do find her.

77
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:56,664
What would
you say to her?

78
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,365
She's 16 years old.

79
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,367
Her name
is Cheryl Mosely.

80
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,369
Thank you so much,
Chandler.

81
00:10:02,402 --> 00:10:04,371
Now let's talk
about tortoises.

82
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,940
Judy, what have
we got here?

83
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:10,010
This is Teddy.
He's 80 years old.

84
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:11,311
80? He's wonderful.

85
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,313
Teddy can
kiss my ass.

86
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:16,316
I'm trying to
find this girl.

87
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:19,186
She was last seen
in North Hollywood.

88
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,321
Contact me
at 468-8492--

89
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:22,956
thank--

90
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,291
shut up, man.

91
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,293
If you have
any information--

92
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,697
yo, if you don't put
the camera over here,

93
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,264
I'll bust your ass.
Leave the camera on.

94
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:34,134
Cheryl Mosely.
Chandler Jarrell.
24 hours a day.

95
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,736
468-8492.

96
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,038
Now you can talk
about tortoises.

97
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,439
Excuse me.

98
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,408
That was Chandler Jarrell.

99
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:44,377
Well, I understand
you've had a sex change.

100
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,946
Correct.

101
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:59,192
Ok, now. Let's go.
Take it slow, now. Tight.

102
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:03,797
Yo! What y'all hanging
in the backcourt for?

103
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,298
All right.

104
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:07,100
There you go.

105
00:11:07,134 --> 00:11:09,770
All the way, boys.
Shoot! Shoot!

106
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:11,739
Whoo!

107
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:14,107
All right.
Come on, now.

108
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,044
Yo, man,
what's wrong with you?

109
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:19,412
You're just mad
because you're scrub.

110
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,914
Scrub.

111
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:28,088
Good afternoon,
Mr. Jarrell.

112
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,289
Hi.

113
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:31,291
So you're the finder
of lost children.

114
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:35,295
You saw me on television.
Yeah. I like working
with children.

115
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:37,130
Chandler,
come on!

116
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:39,199
Shut up!

117
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,370
A child has
been kidnapped.

118
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:44,838
When?

119
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:47,374
Five days ago
in northeastern Tibet.

120
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,277
Tibet's a little
out of my territory.

121
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,212
This child is special.

122
00:11:52,245 --> 00:11:54,948
His destiny is
to save the world.

123
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:56,750
That's
a good destiny.

124
00:11:56,784 --> 00:11:58,752
Hey, Chandler,
throw the ball!

125
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,154
Here!

126
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,023
400 years ago,

127
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,325
the nu trong oracle
predicted

128
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:08,428
that the golden child
would be taken

129
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:11,064
to the city
of the angels

130
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:14,802
and would be rescued
by a man who is no angel.

131
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,237
That's you, Mr. Jarrell.

132
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,039
Ha ha ha! Yeah,
right. Ok.

133
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,541
I'm in the middle
of a basketball game,

134
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:25,445
although I'd love
to stay and chat.

135
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:28,015
This looks like
a big joint.

136
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:29,850
I'm serious,
Mr. Jarrell.

137
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:31,852
Lick it
and smoke it.

138
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:34,454
I think there
was two of these,

139
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,124
and you smoked
the other one.

140
00:12:37,157 --> 00:12:38,992
Put it
in your bag,

141
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:40,961
and stop smoking
scrolls.

142
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:42,963
It looks like
a joint.

143
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,966
You might get
jumped by some
rastafarians.

144
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,836
Excuse me.
I have a game.

145
00:12:48,869 --> 00:12:53,807
It's your destiny
to find the golden child.

146
00:12:53,841 --> 00:12:55,943
And it's your destiny

147
00:12:55,976 --> 00:12:58,311
to seek some serious
psychiatric help.

148
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,313
Can I go play now?

149
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,882
Please. Go home.

150
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:04,284
And such
a cute girl, too.

151
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,219
Dope fiend.

152
00:13:06,253 --> 00:13:08,221
Ha ha ha!

153
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,893
That her?

154
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:14,327
Yeah. That's
Cheryl Mosely.

155
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,463
How long has she
been missing?

156
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:18,331
About three weeks.

157
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:21,468
What do you got?

158
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,036
Not much.

159
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,072
Three days ago,
the rental sign
goes down,

160
00:13:25,105 --> 00:13:28,075
and a white truck
backs over the lawn.

161
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:31,444
The neighbors hear
this low murmur
night and day.

162
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:34,481
Last night
the white truck
pulls up again,

163
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:36,016
and the murmuring
stops.

164
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:39,386
A neighbor comes out
to shut up his dog,

165
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:41,388
looks over the fence,

166
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,523
finds the body.

167
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,465
Who rented the place?

168
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:53,500
She did.

169
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:56,269
By phone.
Mailed in cash.

170
00:13:58,105 --> 00:14:00,107
Did you take that
referral I sent you?

171
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,241
Nope.

172
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:04,244
You only take
the kid cases, huh?

173
00:14:04,277 --> 00:14:05,879
Yeah.

174
00:14:05,913 --> 00:14:09,016
Listen, give me
a few more shots.

175
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,081
O.k.,
miss Tibet,

176
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,083
you can
come out now.

177
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:52,585
I'm not going to
take your case.

178
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:54,721
You're already on it.

179
00:15:54,754 --> 00:15:57,490
Look,
what makes you think

180
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,093
the kid was
in the house?

181
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:02,095
This is
a restraint curse.

182
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:04,431
They need
to keep evil

183
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,567
on all sides of him
at all times.

184
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,103
Just the writing
wouldn't be enough.

185
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:12,139
They'd need
something else.

186
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,473
Or what?

187
00:16:13,506 --> 00:16:17,177
Or the child will
project himself
astrally.

188
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,079
Ha ha ha!

189
00:16:19,112 --> 00:16:21,081
Ha ha ha!

190
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:23,683
Give me a break.

191
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:28,555
So you're telling me

192
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:31,191
that the people
that killed Cheryl--

193
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,193
if I find them--

194
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:36,363
they're the same people
that kidnapped the...

195
00:16:36,396 --> 00:16:38,165
The golden child.

196
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:41,101
But why would they
kill Cheryl?

197
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:42,735
I don't know.

198
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,039
Why are they feeding
the kid blood?

199
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,141
Are you sure?

200
00:16:48,175 --> 00:16:50,143
I found some oatmeal...

201
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:51,511
Yes?

202
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:54,447
With blood in it,
and it's probably hers.

203
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,049
I don't know.

204
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,518
There is somebody
we could ask

205
00:16:58,551 --> 00:17:00,053
about the blood.

206
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,488
This is L.A., though.

207
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:03,723
You're going
to ask somebody?

208
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,093
Are they in this world,

209
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,627
or do we have to
project there...

210
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,697
Some part
of the galaxy?

211
00:17:21,508 --> 00:17:25,478
Mr. Jarrell,
you honor my shop
with your presence.

212
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,584
He's very pleased

213
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:34,554
to meet a man
as great as you.

214
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,157
How do you say
thank you?

215
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,558
Tuch-ey-na.

216
00:17:38,591 --> 00:17:39,859
Tuch-ey-na.

217
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:52,205
Yeah, ok.

218
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,240
Hey!

219
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:14,627
Mr. Jarrell.

220
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:28,575
You may speak with her.
She can hear you.

221
00:18:31,211 --> 00:18:34,181
Tell me about
the golden child.

222
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:37,384
Every thousand generations,

223
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:39,619
a perfect child is born,

224
00:18:39,652 --> 00:18:42,189
a golden child.

225
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:45,725
He has come
to rescue us.

226
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,761
Rescue us
from what?

227
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:51,298
From ourselves.

228
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:53,600
He is the bringer
of compassion.

229
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:57,237
If he dies, compassion
will die with him.

230
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,572
So if something
happens to the kid,

231
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,908
the whole world
goes to hell?

232
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:04,577
The world will
become hell.

233
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:07,180
Ah! Not far
from that now.

234
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:10,450
Who would want
to take the kid,
anyway?

235
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:14,454
Those who want evil
rather than good.

236
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:19,692
Can you be a little bit
more specific?

237
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:22,295
We do not know
who took him.

238
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:26,199
Why are they
trying to make
him eat blood?

239
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:28,868
Nothing in this world
will hurt him,

240
00:19:28,901 --> 00:19:31,538
but if he were
to pollute himself

241
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:34,307
with anything impure,

242
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:36,843
he would become
vulnerable.

243
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:40,213
Ok. So if they...

244
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:43,583
If he eats the blood,
they could kill him.

245
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:45,218
Yes.

246
00:19:45,252 --> 00:19:46,419
Oh.

247
00:19:46,453 --> 00:19:50,423
Do you have
any other questions?

248
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:54,561
As a matter
of fact, I do.

249
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:57,230
What are you doing
this weekend?

250
00:19:57,264 --> 00:19:58,965
Because your silhouette
is kickin'.

251
00:20:03,836 --> 00:20:05,772
She plays
the maracas, too?

252
00:20:08,007 --> 00:20:09,842
This is the chosen one?

253
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,512
Yes.

254
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,514
You people put
on a good show.

255
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,915
Where'd you
find her?

256
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:18,651
She's the librarian
of the pao-shin repository.

257
00:20:18,685 --> 00:20:21,688
She was flown here
to help us.

258
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:23,656
She's over 300 years old.

259
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,658
How'd she manage
that one?

260
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:29,429
One of her ancestors
was raped by a dragon.

261
00:20:31,331 --> 00:20:34,667
Does that happen a lot
where you're from?

262
00:20:34,701 --> 00:20:36,569
Ha ha ha!

263
00:20:46,846 --> 00:20:49,749
I'm sorry.
Why don't you
come up?

264
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,418
No, thank you.

265
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,557
Oh!

266
00:20:58,625 --> 00:20:59,592
Oh!

267
00:20:59,626 --> 00:21:01,361
What is it?

268
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:02,729
The spirits.

269
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,332
The spirits
just told me

270
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,767
that you should
come up

271
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,769
for a little while

272
00:21:09,802 --> 00:21:11,738
and have a drink

273
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:14,307
and wait for further
instructions.

274
00:21:16,743 --> 00:21:19,346
Ha ha ha!
Look, I'm sorry.

275
00:21:19,379 --> 00:21:22,515
Why don't you
come up for a while?

276
00:21:22,549 --> 00:21:24,484
I'll be good.

277
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:26,353
Ok.

278
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:29,021
I tried.

279
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,792
They say you should
always give a woman

280
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,761
two chances to say no,
just in case.

281
00:21:34,794 --> 00:21:36,563
That's no twice.

282
00:21:36,596 --> 00:21:41,568
All right. But the spirits
will be very upset.

283
00:21:41,601 --> 00:21:45,004
You know,
I am the chosen one.

284
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:54,013
Ha ha ha! Ok.

285
00:23:52,131 --> 00:23:54,634
Ha ha ha!

286
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:04,443
Ha ha ha!

287
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:28,535
You wi eat.

288
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:34,874
Get this and the rest
of your playthings

289
00:24:34,907 --> 00:24:36,909
out of here.

290
00:26:26,152 --> 00:26:27,854
Hey, bird...

291
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:31,057
Did you see a little
hare krishna midget

292
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,859
in the tree floating...

293
00:26:32,892 --> 00:26:34,661
Or is it me?

294
00:26:36,696 --> 00:26:39,231
It must be rod serling.

295
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:41,701
Yeah.

296
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:44,704
You the guy looking
for Cheryl Mosely?

297
00:26:44,737 --> 00:26:46,105
Yeah.

298
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:48,074
I know who grabbed her.

299
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:50,042
Ok. Who was
she with?

300
00:26:50,076 --> 00:26:52,044
You ever been
to pacoima?

301
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:53,680
Yeah.

302
00:26:53,713 --> 00:26:56,048
Behind the freeway,
there's this pad

303
00:26:56,082 --> 00:26:59,051
for some bikers
called the yellow dragons.

304
00:26:59,085 --> 00:27:01,688
She was with them
last week,

305
00:27:01,721 --> 00:27:03,690
but she ain't there now.

306
00:27:03,723 --> 00:27:05,692
Who is this? Hello?

307
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,426
What is it?

308
00:27:40,459 --> 00:27:42,695
Nothing.

309
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,864
Look,
I came prepared

310
00:27:44,897 --> 00:27:47,266
in case we
had any other
eventualities.

311
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:51,738
But listen,
you wait here.

312
00:27:51,771 --> 00:27:54,874
Any problem, you leave.
What are you going
to do?

313
00:27:54,907 --> 00:27:56,442
I'll stay here.

314
00:27:56,475 --> 00:27:58,878
No. You stay here now,

315
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,448
but if there's
a problem,
drive away.

316
00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:04,150
Understand me?

317
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:06,418
Ok.

318
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:07,987
Got that?
Stay. Leave.

319
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,756
Ok.

320
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,248
I'm not going
to hurt anybody.

321
00:28:36,282 --> 00:28:38,250
I don't want
no trouble.

322
00:28:38,284 --> 00:28:40,252
I just...
I'm sorry.

323
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:42,254
I just want
some chips.

324
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:44,891
I want some chips.
That's all.

325
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,859
See? Chips. That's it.

326
00:28:46,893 --> 00:28:49,228
Turn that over, man.
It's burning.

327
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:50,863
Turn it over!

328

We sold her.

392
00:33:10,356 --> 00:33:12,258
Sold her? To who?

393
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,126
To Tommy tong.

394
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,229
He got that restaurant
down on Broadway,

395
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:20,399
and...we traded her--

396
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:24,236
a case of cigarettes and
some pork fried rice.

397

Why would somebody
buy somebody?

398
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,706
He needed a girl.

399
00:33:28,707 --> 00:33:30,142
For what?

400
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:32,778
He worked this deal
out with the devil.

401
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,147
Said he needed
the blood.

402
00:33:35,181 --> 00:33:37,349
Ha ha ha.

403
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:38,650
Ha ha ha.

404
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:41,520
You're going to
go over there

405
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:44,123
and rough him up,
right?

406
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:46,525
Don't tell him
I told you.

407
00:33:46,558 --> 00:33:48,527
Why would I
do that?

408
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,063
So let me
get this right.

409
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:52,331
Umm...

410
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:55,334
You sold her?

411
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:56,335
Yeah.

412
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,570
We sold her.

413
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,749
Wait...here.

414
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,669
I'm looking

415

Stop acting stupid.
The man owns the place.

416
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,679
I'm looking

417
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,783
Oh, you don't
speak English?

418
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:46,785
Let me translate
for you.

419
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,155
Bring Tommy tong
out here,

420
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,157
or I'll bust
your ass.
Understand? Huh?

421
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,293
Listen, you see
this dead girl?

422
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:57,196
She was last seen
with tong.

423
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,530
Get Mr. Tong.

424
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:01,133
Yahhhh!

425
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:11,677
I'll show you
how I feel about
that karate shit.

426
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,812
Ok?
Yahh!

427
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,348
Hyah!

428
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:40,272
How'd you do that?

429
00:35:40,306 --> 00:35:42,841
What was that...
With the flip?

430
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:44,470
You killed him.

431
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,305
I didn't kill him.

432
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47,673
What happened?

433
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,409
Maybe the guy
cut hisself shaving

434
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:54,413
and bled to death
looking for a kleenex.

435
00:36:54,446 --> 00:36:57,983
Maybe the guy thought
that I was coming

436
00:36:58,016 --> 00:37:01,320
and got scared
and figured,
what the hell?

437
00:37:01,353 --> 00:37:03,322
And killed hisself.

438
00:37:05,457 --> 00:37:07,359
You buy that?

439
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:08,360
No.

440
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:10,462
Neither do I.

441
00:37:10,496 --> 00:37:13,532
We may be up against
supernatural creatures.

442
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,000
Like what?

443
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:16,602
Demons.

444
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:29,281
By the time
he finds you,

445
00:37:29,315 --> 00:37:31,617
it will be
too late.

446
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:15,060
You were wise
to kill Tommy tong.

447
00:38:15,093 --> 00:38:18,330
He was weak.
He might have betrayed us.

448
00:38:18,364 --> 00:38:20,065
Thank you, lord.

449
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:23,101
But why is the child
still alive?

450
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,338
You have no reason
to fear him.

451
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:29,074
He is surrounded
at all times by evil.

452
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:32,077
Do not underestimate
the power of good,

453
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,647
and do not dismiss
the strength of the child.

454
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:38,750
The child will never
eat the blood.

455
00:38:38,784 --> 00:38:40,652
What must I do?

456
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:44,122
Move the child before
the chosen one draws near.

457
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,057
And to kill him?

458
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:49,094
The adjante dagger.
It's not of this world.

459
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:52,063
But, lord, it is
so well-guarded.

460
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:55,066
Offer to exchange
the child for it.

461
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,103
They can refuse nothing
for his safe return.

462
00:38:58,136 --> 00:39:00,071
Use the adjante dagger.

463
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:03,642
With it, you need
no other evil.

464
00:39:03,675 --> 00:39:07,746
Use the dagger
to kill the child.

465
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:42,841
Good to see you,
Mr. Yarrell.

466
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:51,517
Get your monkey
off my back.

467
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:57,155
Of course.
Fu, please retire.

468
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,591
Yeah, fu.
Save it.

469
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,929
Wait a second.

470
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:06,965
Wait a second.
This is a dream.

471
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:08,734
I'm dreaming.

472
00:41:08,767 --> 00:41:10,201
Hey!

473
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:12,203
Why do you say that?

474
00:41:12,237 --> 00:41:15,641
Because people like fu
with his monkey face

475
00:41:15,674 --> 00:41:17,509
and the big-head guy
and the fat dude

476
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:20,712
and you, you don't
exist for real.

477
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:22,948
Perhaps I've had you
brought here

478
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,684
to make you
an attractive offer.

479
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:29,020
I can't accept a proposal
this early in the season.

480
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,627
Thank you.

481
00:41:36,695 --> 00:41:38,730
Has it
occurred to you

482
00:41:38,764 --> 00:41:41,733
how many men of less
worth than yourself

483
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:43,769
obtain
so many rewards,

484
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:46,304
while you have
so very little?

485
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,874
I can't say that it has.

486
00:41:48,907 --> 00:41:52,177
I don't have that much
of an imagination.

487
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:01,853
I really don't like
your attitude.

488
00:42:01,887 --> 00:42:03,889
You know,
this is a nice jacket.

489
00:42:03,922 --> 00:42:05,857
It's a Morris day feel.

490
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:07,893
It looks good on you.
It's smokin'.

491
00:42:07,926 --> 00:42:12,664
I'll repeat my offer
one last time.

492
00:42:12,698 --> 00:42:14,633
Well, I am dreaming,

493
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:17,669
so I can pretty much
say anything

494
00:42:17,703 --> 00:42:19,638
and get away with it,

495
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:22,207
so I think I'll say
from my heart...

496
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,910
Kiss my ass.

497
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:26,111
Kiss my ass!

498
00:42:29,114 --> 00:42:32,350
It's pointless
talking to you,
Mr. Yarrell.

499
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:36,354
Why do you insist
on mispronouncing my name?

500
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,224
My name is Jarrell
with a "j."

501
00:42:39,257 --> 00:42:40,759
Yes, I know.

502
00:42:40,792 --> 00:42:42,894
My legs are
much more attractive.

503
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:47,298
I will trade the child
for the adyante dagger.

504
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,708
Hey.

505
00:42:56,742 --> 00:42:59,377
This is
just a reminder
of the evening...

506
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,014
So you'll know
you were here.

507
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:04,916
There's no pain
in dreams.

508
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:07,152
You'll remember this
a long time.

509
00:43:07,185 --> 00:43:09,721
Excuse me
for a moment.
I'll be right back.

510
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:13,158
Do you have any methylate
or mercurochrome?

511
00:43:13,191 --> 00:43:15,894
'Cause this
might get infected.

512
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:17,796
Tell your friends

513
00:43:17,829 --> 00:43:20,666
that sardo numspa
sends his greetings.

514
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,719
A mistake.

515
00:43:42,387 --> 00:43:43,689
Yay!
Yay!

516
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:45,356
Kee.

517
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:46,858
Chandler.

518
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:53,131
They tied you up
in toilet paper.

519
00:43:53,164 --> 00:43:55,333
What are you
doing here?

520
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,136
I have to be here.
It's my dream.

521
00:43:58,169 --> 00:44:00,138
I think
the kid's here
somewhere.

522
00:44:00,171 --> 00:44:02,373
We should find
the kid together,

523
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:05,043
and afterwards,
maybe we could spend--

524
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:06,878
some time together.

525
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:07,913
Yeah.

526
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:09,347
Kind of let nature--

527
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:10,916
take its course?

528
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,818
Yeah.

529
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,097
Aah!

530
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:28,366
Ahh! Yah!

531
00:44:28,399 --> 00:44:29,701
Aah!

532
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,489
So...
It's sardo numspa.

533
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,925
What's this knife?

534
00:44:53,959 --> 00:44:57,195
The cross-dagger
of adjante.

535
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:59,798
He brought it
to this world

536
00:44:59,831 --> 00:45:02,834
to kill the second
golden child--

537
00:45:02,868 --> 00:45:05,503
the bearer
of justice.

538
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:08,439
His death
was a great loss.

539
00:45:08,473 --> 00:45:11,376
Sardo needs it
to kill the child,

540
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:14,045
but you can use it
to save him.

541
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,147
You must obtain
the knife

542
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:18,884
and lure numspa
into freeing the child.

543
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:22,453
But never let him
get possession
of the knife.

544
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:25,891
Neat trick. But
how am I supposed to
pull it off?

545
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,931
He will want to
exchange

546
00:45:32,964 --> 00:45:34,933
the dagger
for the child.

547
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:37,936
If the Abbot
will let us have it.

548
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,938
If the kid's
so important,

549
00:45:39,971 --> 00:45:43,341
why doesn't this guy
just give you the dagger?

550
00:45:43,374 --> 00:45:45,877
He's a very
difficult man.

551
00:45:45,911 --> 00:45:49,514
Tomorrow, you will go
with kee nang to Tibet
to obtain the dagger.

552
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:53,084
Man, I ain't
going to Tibet.

553
00:45:53,118 --> 00:45:56,421
Only the chosen one
can obtain the knife.

554
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,989
Will you go?

555
00:46:00,091 --> 00:46:03,294
Listen, this
chosen one thing

556
00:46:03,328 --> 00:46:05,296
is going
too far now.

557
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,365
This is not normal.

558
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:09,200
Ok?

559
00:46:09,234 --> 00:46:11,837
I have to think
this over

560
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:15,073
because the chosen one
thing--too far.

561
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:18,109
Could you
please leave us
for a moment?

562
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:20,111
You all
talk it over

563
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:22,113
because this
should be discussed

564
00:46:22,147 --> 00:46:24,850
because it's
not normal. Talk.

565
00:46:24,883 --> 00:46:26,852
The chosen one.

566
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:29,554
Chosen one. Why Tibet?

567
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:33,925
Why can't somebody choose
me to go to The Bahamas?

568
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:37,562
I got to get chosen
to go to Tibet.

569
00:46:37,595 --> 00:46:40,531
And, kala, you're not
a normal chick.

570
00:46:40,565 --> 00:46:44,602
You can't sit in this basement
naked, smoking cigarettes,

571
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:48,306
looking at soap operas
for the rest of your life.

572
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,193
Yak loin.

573
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:10,161
What is it?

574
00:47:10,195 --> 00:47:12,597
Yak loin.
Good to keep
the Yang up.

575
00:47:14,399 --> 00:47:17,135
Ain't nothing
wrong with my Yang.

576
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:24,342
Tell me how this
dream transmission
thing works.

577
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,344
Part's dream,
and part's real.

578
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:27,979
So this scar
is real?

579
00:47:28,013 --> 00:47:29,347
Right.

580
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:30,949
What about numsy?

581
00:47:30,982 --> 00:47:34,352
Sardo numspa.
He's very real.

582
00:47:34,385 --> 00:47:37,255
You said some things
that seemed real.

583
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,991
That part was dream.

584
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:46,631
I was just checking.

585
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,574
Aren't you going to
ask me up?

586
00:47:59,444 --> 00:48:01,346
Am I dreaming now?

587
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:03,348
Must a lady ask twice?

588
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:05,650
No. No, please.

589
00:48:05,683 --> 00:48:07,618
No. Please twice.

590
00:48:07,652 --> 00:48:09,220
Please, please.

591
00:48:09,254 --> 00:48:11,122
Twice.

592
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:24,702
Hey. I didn't know whether
you wanted cream and sugar.
I left it black.

593
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:27,372
I want you
to go to Tibet.

594
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,274
Will you go?

595
00:48:29,307 --> 00:48:32,277
I hear it's
really cold in Tibet.

596
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:34,712
Why don't we
just stay here?

597
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,682
Why don't we stay here
all weekend long

598
00:48:37,715 --> 00:48:39,684
under the covers,
watching television,

599
00:48:39,717 --> 00:48:42,320
sweating and smiling
and everything?

600
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,488
You won't go?

601
00:48:43,521 --> 00:48:45,623
It's freezing
in Tibet.

602
00:48:45,656 --> 00:48:48,259
Hey. Hey,
where you going?

603
00:48:48,293 --> 00:48:49,694
Tibet.

604
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:53,498
But I'm the chosen one.
You can't get the knife.

605
00:48:59,637 --> 00:49:03,108
I'll go.
I'll go to Tibet.

606
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:04,542
Wait.

607
00:49:06,011 --> 00:49:09,981
But if it's really cold,
we got to come back. Ok?

608
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:14,986
You're not in a rush
to leave, are you?

609
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:17,222
Because, you know...

610
00:49:21,226 --> 00:49:22,627
A bed?

611
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,629
Is that a bed?

612
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:17,315
Kathmandu,
the gateway to Tibet.

613
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:20,051
There are bulls
walking around here.

614
00:50:20,085 --> 00:50:22,053
Two days into
the mountains,

615
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:25,490
and we will be
at the heights
of heaven.

616
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:27,225
Look, I'm freezing,

617
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:29,227
and I'm not
enjoying myself,

618
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,798
but I'll do my best
to find this golden child.

619
00:50:33,831 --> 00:50:36,101
I'll arrange
for our trek.

620
00:50:36,134 --> 00:50:39,104
You have an hour
to look around.

621
00:51:23,181 --> 00:51:28,119
4:30, but I don't think I can
make it to the party.

622
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:31,189
Ha ha.

623
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,396
Hi.

624
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:17,335
Take it easy.

625
00:52:19,337 --> 00:52:21,839
You want me
to buy that?

626
00:52:22,907 --> 00:52:24,842
Ok. I'll buy one.

627
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:27,778
Ok. Let me have
the blue one.

628
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,547
How much is one?

629
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:33,651
I don't know
how much they cost.

630
00:52:33,684 --> 00:52:36,821
Ok. The blue one
matches my coat.

631
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:46,497
Hey, wait a second.
You took 100.

632
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,633
You took the 100.

633
00:52:48,666 --> 00:52:51,436
No. See,
$1.00 is for you.

634
00:52:51,469 --> 00:52:53,404
See this
George Washington?

635
00:52:53,438 --> 00:52:55,573
That's
Benjamin Franklin.
That's not happening.

636
00:52:55,606 --> 00:52:57,642
You got
the wrong money.

637
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,610
Ahh...ahh...

638
00:53:00,878 --> 00:53:03,481
Can I have
my money back?

639
00:53:04,682 --> 00:53:07,718
You gave me
the wrong necklace, too.

640
00:53:07,752 --> 00:53:10,521
You're breaking my heart,
asswipe.

641
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:13,591
Oh, you speak
English just fine.

642
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:15,960
So do you.
So what?

643
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:17,962
Give me
my 100 back

644
00:53:17,995 --> 00:53:20,598
and give me
the right one.

645
00:53:20,631 --> 00:53:22,467
Monkey breath,
puke face,

646
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,635
eater of turtle slime.

647
00:53:24,669 --> 00:53:25,936
Ha...

648
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:29,274
Give me my shit,
and you take
your shit.

649
00:53:29,307 --> 00:53:30,508
What, scuzzbucket?

650
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,243
Ok, you slick
shithead,

651
00:53:32,277 --> 00:53:35,646
you sneaky
little bastard.

652
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,449
You want your money?
Take it.

653
00:53:59,404 --> 00:54:02,307
Did you see
a little naked man

654
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,775
running around
with a $100 bill?

655
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:07,745
I've arranged for yaks,
ponies, and boats.

656
00:54:07,778 --> 00:54:10,381
You didn't see
a naked bum
with $100?

657
00:54:10,415 --> 00:54:12,650
No, but I could
arrange for one.

658
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:15,386
You got to show up
sooner or later!

659
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:17,955
And when you do,
your ass is kicked!

660
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,056
And I'm gonna
sell your clothes!

661
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:22,026
Leave you
in Kathmandu

662
00:54:22,059 --> 00:54:24,529
naked and bleeding
with no money!

663
00:54:24,562 --> 00:54:26,531
The dude took my money.

664
00:54:30,535 --> 00:54:32,403
If I had my $100,

665
00:54:32,437 --> 00:54:34,639
we could have got
a motorboat.

666
00:54:34,672 --> 00:54:36,574
Shut up and paddle.

667
00:54:36,607 --> 00:54:38,376
I'll paddle his ass.

668
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:41,312
I'll paddle your ass
when I find you!

669
00:54:41,346 --> 00:54:44,615
I'm gonna row your ass
till it bleeds!

670
00:54:57,428 --> 00:54:58,863
We'll be there soon.

671
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:01,966
Better have a spatula
where we're going,

672
00:55:01,999 --> 00:55:05,069
'cause my ass is frozen
to this yak!

673
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,515
We bow.

674
00:55:57,087 --> 00:55:58,656
That's the dude
that took my money!

675
00:56:06,764 --> 00:56:08,733
We have come to ask

676
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:12,169
for the sacred
cross-dagger of adjante.

677
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,971
For what reason?

678
00:56:14,004 --> 00:56:16,974
For the golden child.

679
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,909
He does not need it.

680
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:21,045
To save his life.

681
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:25,716
The child lives for our
sakes, not for his own.

682
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:28,786
I humbly beg you,

683
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:30,888
let us have
the knife.

684
00:56:33,591 --> 00:56:35,092
Let him ask it.

685
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,905
I said, i-i-i-i-i-i

686
00:56:47,938 --> 00:56:49,974
want the knife.

687
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,550
Let him ask again.

688
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:16,433
I want the knife.

689
00:57:18,703 --> 00:57:21,472
Please.

690
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,756
Only a man
whose heart is pure
can wield the knife,

691
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:40,791
and if you're
such a man,

692
00:57:40,825 --> 00:57:42,493
you will have it.

693
00:57:44,228 --> 00:57:47,097
Only a man
whose heart is pure

694
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,966
can wield the knife,

695
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:51,969
and only a man
whose ass is narrow

696
00:57:52,002 --> 00:57:53,871
can get down these steps.

697
00:57:53,904 --> 00:57:57,842
If mine is such a ass,
then I shall have it.

698
00:58:00,545 --> 00:58:02,146
Oh, shit.

699
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:04,849
Beyond the door
is a corridor.

700
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:08,252
At the other end is
the sacred adjante dagger.

701
00:58:08,285 --> 00:58:11,956
If you walk to the end
of the corridor
and retrieve it,

702
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,924
the dagger is yours.

703
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,926
That sounds
simple enough.

704
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:17,294
Just one thing--

705
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:20,230
carry this without
spilling one drop.

706
00:58:20,264 --> 00:58:22,066
Who are you,
monty hall now?

707
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:24,201
You must be
Carol merrill.

708
00:58:24,234 --> 00:58:26,236
Don't spill
any water.
This is crazy.

709
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,206
Keep your thoughts
as pure as the water.

710
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,042
This water ain't
really that pure.

711
00:58:32,076 --> 00:58:33,544
Neither are you.

712
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:37,314
I give you this advice--
stay on the path.

713
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,250
Ha ha!
You got it.

714
00:58:41,586 --> 00:58:43,788
Woo! Woo! Woo!

715
00:58:43,821 --> 00:58:47,558
I'm so afraid
of the dark, too.

716
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:04,809
You need to
get somebody

717
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:07,578
to come clean up
down here!

718
00:59:13,851 --> 00:59:15,953
Woo-oo-oo-oo!

719
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:33,871
This is
a piece of cake.

720
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:37,041
This is a piece
of cake! Ok?!

721
00:59:49,954 --> 00:59:51,989
Hey, there's no floor.

722
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:54,692
There's no ground.

723
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:56,393
Wait a minute.

724
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:57,962
There's a ground!

725
00:59:57,995 --> 01:00:00,965
You're making it look like
it's no ground

726
01:00:00,998 --> 01:00:06,003
to see if I'm going to be scared
and run back and say--

727
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:08,005
there's a ground.

728
01:00:08,038 --> 01:00:10,741
There's a ground, monty.

729
01:00:31,428 --> 01:00:33,764
There's no ground here!

730
01:00:34,865 --> 01:00:36,300
Oh, shit.

731
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:54,384
Remember...stay on the path!

732
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:56,987
I heard you
the first time!

733
01:00:57,021 --> 01:01:00,825
Let's just hope
the path stays under me.

734
01:01:36,961 --> 01:01:40,230
You said I was supposed to
stay on the path!

735
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:43,968
Yes, but you must know
when to break the rules.

736
01:01:44,001 --> 01:01:46,737
How many people
have survived this test?

737
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:48,405
None!

738
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,774
None?

739
01:01:50,407 --> 01:01:51,876
None?

740
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:55,913
I'll break your ass
when I get out of here!

741
01:02:56,473 --> 01:02:59,409
What am I doing wrong?!

742
01:02:59,443 --> 01:03:01,411
I followed all your rules!

743
01:03:01,445 --> 01:03:05,015
What am I doing wrong?

744
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:09,386
Keep your mind and your thoughts
as pure as the water.

745
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:12,522
Don't drop the water.
Don't drop the water.

746
01:03:13,991 --> 01:03:16,393
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

747
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:17,962
Wait a minute.

748
01:03:17,995 --> 01:03:19,997
Wait, wait, wait.
The water.

749
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,966
Fire and the water.

750
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,533
Ok.

751
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,008
To monty...

752
01:03:31,041 --> 01:03:33,143
A toast!

753
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:51,261
Ha!

754
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:54,865
Ha! I got the knife!

755
01:03:54,899 --> 01:03:57,367
Now, turn on
the goddamn lights!

756
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:12,382
What is it,
asswipe?

757
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,555
Listen,
I want your advice
about something.

758
01:04:21,025 --> 01:04:23,227
I'm going to
let that slide.
It's your way.

759
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:26,997
Don't press
your luck, though.

760
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:36,206
I know that you're
a very old and wise and...

761
01:04:36,240 --> 01:04:39,209
Disgusting guy,

762
01:04:39,243 --> 01:04:41,311
and...

763
01:04:41,345 --> 01:04:43,313
Gonna wipe that
on your jacket, huh?

764
01:04:43,347 --> 01:04:46,150
I was wondering
what a man says

765
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:48,585
to a woman
from your world

766
01:04:48,618 --> 01:04:52,489
when he loves her
and wants to marry her.

767
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:54,992
If you took
the short path

768
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:57,027
and reached
enlightenment
before tomorrow,

769
01:04:57,061 --> 01:05:00,030
who would want you
for a husband?

770
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:02,566
What's the short path?

771
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:05,669
First of all,
you must remain pure.

772
01:05:05,702 --> 01:05:07,504
What do you mean?

773
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,606
You know
what I mean.

774
01:05:14,678 --> 01:05:17,247
Oh, you mean...

775
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:20,617
Ha ha ha!

776
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:22,352
Is there a long way?

777
01:05:22,386 --> 01:05:24,654
It takes
10,000 lifetimes.

778
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:26,556
We don't have
that much time.

779
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:28,525
No women.
What else?

780
01:05:28,558 --> 01:05:30,160
For you?

781
01:05:30,194 --> 01:05:32,162
You must
trust someone

782
01:05:32,196 --> 01:05:34,564
you have no reason
to trust.

783
01:05:34,598 --> 01:05:37,101
You must
make a promise

784
01:05:37,134 --> 01:05:39,569
to someone
you have just met,

785
01:05:39,603 --> 01:05:43,007
and you must
love someone
who loves you.

786
01:05:45,142 --> 01:05:47,611
How will I know when
to do these things?

787
01:05:47,644 --> 01:05:49,746
That's for you
to decide.

788
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:53,350
You must
tell no one

789
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:56,520
I have put you
on the path.

790
01:05:56,553 --> 01:06:00,124
Uh...thanks
for your help.

791
01:06:00,157 --> 01:06:04,128
Ha ha! He thinks
I helped him.

792
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:08,332
Get that booger
off your jacket
before it freezes up.

793
01:06:08,365 --> 01:06:10,300
You'll scratch yourself.

794
01:06:11,601 --> 01:06:14,571
Keep that 100
'cause there's no telling

795
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:19,309
what might be on the bill
when you give it back.

796
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:30,787
Gunpa...

797
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,557
I have ruined myself
with the American.

798
01:06:33,590 --> 01:06:36,260
He's a fool.

799
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:38,428
But he's brave.

800
01:06:38,462 --> 01:06:40,364
He's irresponsible.

801
01:06:40,397 --> 01:06:42,499
He's generous.

802
01:06:42,532 --> 01:06:44,701
He thinks of nothing

803
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,504
but protecting
his own feelings.

804
01:06:47,537 --> 01:06:51,108
But if you
touch his heart,

805
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:54,278
there's nothing
he wouldn't do for you.

806
01:06:54,311 --> 01:06:56,280
He believes
in nothing.

807
01:06:56,313 --> 01:06:59,683
And still he does
what is right.

808
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,719
He is a callous,
thoughtless,
undisciplined fool.

809
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:03,787
Yes.

810
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:06,323
I do like him
very much.

811
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,425
It's very hard not to.

812
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,695
Those magnificent
Americans...

813
01:07:11,728 --> 01:07:13,263
So much power

814
01:07:13,297 --> 01:07:17,167
and so little understanding
what to do with it.

815
01:07:17,201 --> 01:07:20,304
What should I do?

816
01:07:23,307 --> 01:07:27,311
You must help him
save the golden child...

817
01:07:27,344 --> 01:07:29,446
And follow your heart.

818
01:07:32,716 --> 01:07:34,684
Thank you, gunpa.

819
01:07:34,718 --> 01:07:37,287
You're welcome,
daughter.

820
01:07:38,588 --> 01:07:40,757
And when you want
to marry him,

821
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:42,492
you have my blessing.

822
01:07:44,328 --> 01:07:46,396
Thank you.

823
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:58,308
They won't let me
on the plane
with this knife.

824
01:07:58,342 --> 01:07:59,709
Yes, they will.

825
01:07:59,743 --> 01:08:03,147
No, they won't.
I'm going to jail.

826
01:08:04,214 --> 01:08:05,282
Thank you.

827
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:06,683
This won't work.

828
01:08:06,716 --> 01:08:10,254
I'm going to spend
the rest of my life

829
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,689
in a Clay cell
in Kathmandu.

830
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:13,857
Another cow?

831
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,159
It's Kathmandu.
What did you expect?

832
01:08:15,192 --> 01:08:18,362
They won't let me
on the plane

833
01:08:18,395 --> 01:08:20,797
with a 2-foot knife
under my shirt.

834
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,633
Relax. Trust
in your destiny.

835
01:08:23,667 --> 01:08:25,902
You trust
in you destiny.

836
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,837
Come with me,
please.

837
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:29,473
I have nothing
to declare.

838
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:30,474
It's necessary.

839
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:31,541
See?

840
01:08:31,575 --> 01:08:33,443
It's for
your own protection.

841
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:34,911
These are
just my drawers.

842
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,480
That's my clean ones.

843
01:08:36,513 --> 01:08:37,881
These are
dirty ones.

844
01:08:37,914 --> 01:08:39,683
Excuse me.
I've a plane to catch.

845
01:08:39,716 --> 01:08:42,286
Come on. Come on.
Hurry up.

846
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:43,887
What's this?

847
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:46,423
I want to go
back to America.

848
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,392
I'm a citizen, ok?

849
01:08:48,425 --> 01:08:50,394
What are you
looking at?

850
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:52,796
It just does
my heart good

851
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:55,399
to see another
American citizen!

852
01:08:58,268 --> 01:08:59,836
Hold it right there!

853
01:08:59,869 --> 01:09:01,805
No, I'm not crazy!

854
01:09:01,838 --> 01:09:03,807
I'm agent
Chandler Jarrell

855
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:06,410
from the American
stolen artifacts
foundation.

856
01:09:06,443 --> 01:09:07,777
Everybody, it's ok.

857
01:09:07,811 --> 01:09:10,380
I'm the stolen
artifacts
foundation man!

858
01:09:10,414 --> 01:09:12,816
Freddie, get out
of my sight!

859
01:09:12,849 --> 01:09:14,651
You make me sick!

860
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,821
I'll talk to you
on the plane, Freddie!

861
01:09:17,854 --> 01:09:19,823
Nobody be alarmed!
I'm Chandler Jarrell,

862
01:09:19,856 --> 01:09:22,792
American stolen artifacts
foundation of America.

863
01:09:22,826 --> 01:09:24,294
Thanks to you,

864
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:27,364
we were able to catch
this piece of shit,

865
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:30,934
and I thank
the good people of Nepal!

866
01:09:30,967 --> 01:09:33,670
A bunch
of brilliant buggers,
all of you.

867
01:09:33,703 --> 01:09:36,840
You are one hell
of a leader.

868
01:09:36,873 --> 01:09:38,875
The keen,
the cunningness...

869
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:41,445
The instinct!
The instinct

870
01:09:41,478 --> 01:09:42,646
is brilliant!

871
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,281
I can tell you trained
under this man,

872
01:09:44,314 --> 01:09:46,650
'cause you have
the same glare
in your eye.

873
01:09:46,683 --> 01:09:50,587
You don't know what you did,
but you're brilliant.

874
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:51,955
The best brilliance

875
01:09:51,988 --> 01:09:54,658
is brilliance born
from someone ignorant.

876
01:09:54,691 --> 01:09:57,561
This is my assistant
kee nang here--

877
01:09:57,594 --> 01:09:58,995
agent 69--

878
01:09:59,028 --> 01:10:00,564
we thank you!

879
01:10:00,597 --> 01:10:03,233
The people of Nepal,
thank you!

880
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:05,835
You're a bunch of beautiful,
brilliant people!

881
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:06,970
Nepal!

882
01:10:07,003 --> 01:10:09,273
N-e-p-a-l!

883
01:10:09,306 --> 01:10:11,708
Viva Nepal!
Viva Nepal!

884
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:06,363
Welcome back.

885
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:07,631
Thank you.

886
01:11:07,664 --> 01:11:10,066
Hey, this is
your problem now.

887
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:13,503
You did a marvelous job
obtaining the knife.

888
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:19,075
You will be spending
the next few days

889
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:21,545
at a house
of a friend.

890
01:11:21,578 --> 01:11:24,881
When will we be contacted
about the knife?

891
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,585
That's Chandler yarrell.

892
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:31,020
If he doesn't
return my property,

893
01:11:31,054 --> 01:11:32,589
arrest him.

894
01:11:37,461 --> 01:11:39,396
Welcome home,
Mr. Yarrell.

895
01:11:39,429 --> 01:11:41,731
You have
something for me?

896
01:11:47,003 --> 01:11:48,705
I'm sorry, numsy.

897
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,707
I should be punished!

898
01:11:50,740 --> 01:11:54,010
Everyone, I have stolen
from my brother numsy.

899
01:11:54,043 --> 01:11:57,080
Officer, it's your duty
to take me in. Please.

900
01:11:57,113 --> 01:12:00,016
Purge me.
I am ashamed of myself.

901
01:12:00,049 --> 01:12:03,353
I should be arrested.
I should be purged.

902
01:12:03,387 --> 01:12:05,121
I should be flogged.

903
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:08,124
Let me have
a word with him.

904
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,727
I am a swine,
a wretch.

905
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:14,531
How long can you keep up
this masquerade?

906
01:12:14,564 --> 01:12:18,034
Until you realize
the rules of evidence
in this country.

907
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,136
See, if
I get arrested,

908
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:23,139
they put me
in a jail cell.

909
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:25,409
Then they take
the knife, because
it's a stolen object,

910
01:12:25,442 --> 01:12:28,378
and they put that
in a little room.

911
01:12:28,412 --> 01:12:30,680
They put
"exhibit a" on it.

912
01:12:30,714 --> 01:12:32,716
I sit in my room.

913
01:12:32,749 --> 01:12:35,118
The knife
sits in its room

914
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:37,487
until the trial
comes up--a month
to a year.

915
01:12:37,521 --> 01:12:38,922
So if you get me
arrested,

916
01:12:38,955 --> 01:12:42,091
there's no telling
when you'll get
your knife.

917
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:48,798
You've no idea
who I am, have you?

918
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:53,069
Yes. You're
sardo numsy!

919
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:56,540
Look, I don't care
who you are.

920
01:12:56,573 --> 01:12:58,675
I do care that
you kidnapped
a little kid.

921
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,711
I could destroy you...
Just like that.

922
01:13:01,745 --> 01:13:03,647
We wouldn't
want that.

923
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,582
Listen.
Bring me the boy.

924
01:13:05,615 --> 01:13:07,551
I'll give you
the knife.

925
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:10,620
Then no one
will have to
be destroyed...

926
01:13:10,654 --> 01:13:12,088
Just like that.

927
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,823
Think it over.

928
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:17,527
My brother's
forgiven me!

929
01:13:17,561 --> 01:13:18,962
Kee, Dr. Hong,

930
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:21,565
brother numsy
has forgiven me.

931
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:22,966
Dear brother,

932
01:13:22,999 --> 01:13:24,934
thank you,
thank you.

933
01:13:24,968 --> 01:13:26,636
You're wonderful.

934
01:13:26,670 --> 01:13:31,040
I told him I wouldn't
be so polite next time.

935
01:13:31,074 --> 01:13:32,776
You a foolhardy,
aren't you?

936
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,811
I do my best.

937
01:14:26,763 --> 01:14:29,165
Are you
coming to bed?

938
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:34,904
No. I think I'm going
to sleep out here.

939
01:14:37,574 --> 01:14:38,808
Oh.

940
01:14:39,709 --> 01:14:41,511
Good night.

941
01:15:09,105 --> 01:15:10,707
Aah!

942
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:37,133
I just heard
something.

943
01:15:38,234 --> 01:15:40,236
I don't like this.

944
01:15:40,269 --> 01:15:43,006
Let's get
out of here.

945
01:16:35,291 --> 01:16:37,160
Run!

946
01:17:30,313 --> 01:17:34,317
I didn't spend
the night with you
to obligate you.

947
01:17:34,350 --> 01:17:37,020
I spent the night
with you

948
01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:38,922
because I love you.

949
01:17:50,967 --> 01:17:53,336
She's beyond
this world of pain.

950
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:54,971
Kala:
You can save her.

951
01:17:55,004 --> 01:17:59,075
The golden child
can bring her back

952
01:17:59,108 --> 01:18:01,945
as long as sunlight
still shines on her.

953
01:18:01,978 --> 01:18:04,881
No more magic!
She's dead!

954
01:18:10,453 --> 01:18:14,157
You are the chosen one.
You will find the child.

955
01:18:14,190 --> 01:18:16,325
You have until nightfall
to find the child.

956
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:19,095
Sardo cannot kill him
until dark.

957
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:14,470
Aah!

958
01:21:38,194 --> 01:21:39,996
Shh...

959
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:48,204
Shh...

960
01:22:08,524 --> 01:22:11,194
We'll get you
out of here. Ok?

961
01:22:22,571 --> 01:22:25,074
Hey, where's
your boss?

962
01:22:25,741 --> 01:22:28,244
Keep an eye
on the kid.

963
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:30,346
This won't
take long.

964
01:22:32,748 --> 01:22:36,419
My dear, sweet
brother numsy.

965
01:22:45,161 --> 01:22:47,396
I can see you're busy
right now.

966
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:49,565
I'll come back
some other time.

967
01:23:02,211 --> 01:23:04,713
There are no keys
in the car!

968
01:23:04,747 --> 01:23:06,549
No keys!

969
01:23:06,582 --> 01:23:07,650
Oh, come on!

970
01:23:07,683 --> 01:23:09,552
Come on! Come on!

971
01:23:13,822 --> 01:23:15,224
Everything will be ok.

972
01:23:15,258 --> 01:23:16,492
I know.

973
01:23:16,525 --> 01:23:18,527
Fasten your
seat belt, kid.

974
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,677
Somebody give you
a valium or what?

975
01:23:40,183 --> 01:23:42,751
This kind of thing must happen
a lot where you're from.

976
01:23:42,785 --> 01:23:44,320
I feel like I'm gonna
shit on myself.

977
01:24:10,379 --> 01:24:13,716
Hey! Hey, Goldie!

978
01:24:13,749 --> 01:24:15,818
You won't even help me?

979
01:24:15,851 --> 01:24:18,121
You'll just
keep running, right?

980
01:24:23,526 --> 01:24:24,693
Hey!

981
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:25,828
Wait!

982
01:28:41,517 --> 01:28:44,520
How long are you
going to be?

983
01:28:44,553 --> 01:28:46,021
About two weeks.

984
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:49,057
You'll drop the kid off
and come back.

985
01:28:49,091 --> 01:28:50,058
Yes.

986
01:28:50,092 --> 01:28:52,628
I bought this
for you, ok?

987
01:28:52,661 --> 01:28:55,998
Put that on,
and you don't have to worry

988
01:28:56,031 --> 01:28:59,034
about other kids
messing with your head.

989
01:28:59,067 --> 01:29:03,539
You don't want to go to
Tibet with a big head.

990
01:29:03,572 --> 01:29:05,073
Ha ha ha!

991
01:29:05,107 --> 01:29:07,476
That is
a cool trick.

992
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:10,913
Did you ever think about
going into show business?

993
01:29:10,946 --> 01:29:14,016
I throw a rock,
you make it float off--

994
01:29:14,049 --> 01:29:16,652
standing ovations
all over the place.

995
01:29:16,685 --> 01:29:19,622
You ever hear
of ed McMahon's star search?

996
01:29:19,655 --> 01:29:21,890
Do they have
star search in Tibet?

997
01:29:21,924 --> 01:29:23,959
Probably not.
Probably have food search.

998
01:29:23,992 --> 01:29:27,095
We could all go
on star search

999
01:29:27,129 --> 01:29:30,098
and let the audience
throw rocks at you,

1000
01:29:30,132 --> 01:29:34,837
and you can make them all
hit ed McMahon...Hard.
Ha ha ha!
