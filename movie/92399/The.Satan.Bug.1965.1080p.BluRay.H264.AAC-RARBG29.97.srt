1
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:15,818
Thanks. I'll see ya.
Yes, sir.

2
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:28,289
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Raskin.

3
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,708
I see you've got
the duty again.

4
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,003
You've been
back there a week.
It comes around.

5
00:04:34,545 --> 00:04:36,005
Thanks.

6
00:04:54,231 --> 00:04:56,108
Good night,
Dr. Ostrer.

7
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,693
Good night,
Reagan.

8
00:04:57,734 --> 00:04:59,529
Oh, Reagan.

9
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:09,246
Reagan, I've gotta
talk to you.

10
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:11,165
I've got a minute now.

11
00:05:11,206 --> 00:05:14,626
No. But I want to see you
tomorrow morning.

12
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,964
I'll come by your house.
10:00?

13
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,675
Fine.

14
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:32,186
What's this?
Laboratory equipment
replacements.

15
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:34,063
Well, what happened
while I was gone?

16
00:05:34,104 --> 00:05:36,023
Nothing, sir.

17
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,319
The Director?

18
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,988
Well, you know
Dr. Baxter,
he's still...

19
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:44,406
Introverted.

20
00:05:44,449 --> 00:05:45,950
Yes, sir.

21
00:05:46,909 --> 00:05:49,161
Who's left in E Lab?

22
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:53,374
There's six,
Dr. Baxter, Hoffman, Yang,
and three technicians.

23
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,334
GUARD: Correct.

24
00:05:55,375 --> 00:05:58,254
Gonna get these inside?
Yes, sir.

25
00:06:12,268 --> 00:06:14,103
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mason.

26
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:15,896
Who's left in there?

27
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:20,485
Six, sir. Dr. Baxter,
Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Yang,
and three technicians.

28
00:06:46,761 --> 00:06:48,388
Dr. Hoffman.

29
00:06:48,429 --> 00:06:50,389
Good evening, Reagan.

30
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,225
Is the Director in there?
Yes.

31
00:06:55,144 --> 00:06:57,229
Working late tonight?

32
00:06:57,646 --> 00:06:59,148
No.

33
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:19,835
Well, how was it
on the Potomac?

34
00:07:21,253 --> 00:07:25,591
Not quiet.

35
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:30,220
I... I understand
the man has given us
a new administrator,

36
00:07:30,261 --> 00:07:33,349
Dr. Leonard Michaelson?

37
00:07:34,434 --> 00:07:36,310
Who told you that?

38
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,023
Dr. Hoffman.

39
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:47,238
The cleaning woman told him.

40
00:07:47,988 --> 00:07:50,115
Not funny.

41
00:07:50,156 --> 00:07:52,993
Well, it's Friday.

42
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,580
Good night, Reagan.
See you Monday.

43
00:07:55,621 --> 00:07:57,289
Good night, Doctor.

44
00:08:11,053 --> 00:08:14,681
Any trouble?
No, sir. Just some
minor residuals.

45
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:17,268
There's a couple of
crates outside.
Let's get 'em in.

46
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:20,104
Yes, sir.
Raskin just called.

47
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,130
Good evening, Doctor.

48
00:08:46,713 --> 00:08:48,133
Oh.

49
00:08:50,009 --> 00:08:51,218
What is it, Reagan?

50
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,640
Working late?

51
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:59,769
No. But I'll be
in tomorrow.

52
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:02,104
What time?
8:00.

53
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:06,483
I'll set the time lock
for you.

54
00:09:06,525 --> 00:09:09,404
Last time you
locked yourself out
until Monday.

55
00:09:09,445 --> 00:09:11,030
I know.

56
00:09:12,698 --> 00:09:14,825
You've been away,
haven't you?

57
00:09:14,866 --> 00:09:16,660
Washington.

58
00:09:17,994 --> 00:09:21,373
How worried are they?

59
00:09:21,415 --> 00:09:25,961
Well, they're always
worried about the security
of this place.

60
00:09:26,003 --> 00:09:28,255
My job's like that.

61
00:09:29,756 --> 00:09:32,718
What they're really
worried about is that.

62
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,845
Yes, sir.

63
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:40,141
Did you, uh,
reassure them?

64
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:43,270
No. I leave that to you.

65
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,396
Yes.

66
00:09:49,694 --> 00:09:53,029
Sir, do you think...

67
00:09:53,071 --> 00:09:57,243
Why don't you
take this Saturday
and Sunday off, Doctor?

68
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:59,244
Do you good.

69
00:09:59,285 --> 00:10:02,498
No time for that, Reagan.

70
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,916
No time.

71
00:10:07,628 --> 00:10:11,173
Tired men
make mistakes, Doctor.

72
00:10:11,215 --> 00:10:15,260
God help us
if a mistake's made here.

73
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,478
Goodnight, Doctor.

74
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,441
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

75
00:10:30,484 --> 00:10:33,238
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

76
00:10:44,956 --> 00:10:48,001
Good night, Mason.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.

77
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,908
Good night,
Dr. Hoffman.

78
00:11:35,174 --> 00:11:37,259
You are leaving, Doctor?

79
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:40,179
I'll be a few minutes.

80
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:46,185
Do you need me
for anything?

81
00:11:46,226 --> 00:11:47,728
No.

82
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:50,940
Good night, Hoffman.

83
00:12:01,825 --> 00:12:03,076
(SIGHING)

84
00:12:06,037 --> 00:12:09,709
Goodnight, Dr. Hoffman.
Goodnight, Mason.

85
00:12:34,816 --> 00:12:37,236
Good night, Doctor.

86
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,994
Good night, Doctor.

(AIR LOCK WHIRRING)

(PHONE RINGING)

89
00:14:27,471 --> 00:14:29,180
Mason speaking.

90
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,434
Is Doctor Williams in?

91
00:14:32,476 --> 00:14:35,270
MASON: Dr. Williams
is not in E Lab.

92
00:14:36,563 --> 00:14:39,649
Good night,
Dr. Baxter.

93
00:14:39,691 --> 00:14:43,445
Two sixteen.
That's administration.

94
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:45,990
You're welcome.

95
00:15:10,805 --> 00:15:14,100
It's Mason.
E Lab clear and closed.

96
00:15:15,269 --> 00:15:16,520
Right.

97
00:15:28,239 --> 00:15:31,035
Good night,
Doctor Baxter.

98
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:40,585
Good night, Doctor.

99
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,074
Raskin.

100
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:12,701
Yes, sir.

101
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:15,704
Reagan.
I'm going into E Lab.

102
00:17:52,718 --> 00:17:55,220
The shoulder on
that back road's caved in.

103
00:17:55,261 --> 00:17:58,683
We ought to
take care of that tomorrow.
All right.

104
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:02,060
Might as well make
a note of it in the log
for Mr. Reagan in the morning.

105
00:18:02,101 --> 00:18:04,270
I'll tell him
when he leaves.

106
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:07,983
He's still here?
Mmm-hmm. E Lab.

107
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:13,363
What time
did he go in there?

108
00:18:23,331 --> 00:18:25,334
Mr. Reagan.

109
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:31,215
Mr. Reagan.

110
00:18:35,094 --> 00:18:38,221
RASKIN ON PA:
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

111
00:18:41,433 --> 00:18:43,643
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

112
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:55,155
Get over there
and check that
security door.

113
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:09,835
This is Lieutenant Raskin,
Duty Officer, Station Three.

114
00:19:09,878 --> 00:19:15,509
Get me the Director,
Dr. Baxter, at home,
or Mr. Tasserly. Right.

115
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,845
(BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC)

116
00:19:45,914 --> 00:19:48,208
There's a phone call for you.
What?

117
00:19:48,249 --> 00:19:49,834
There's a phone call for you.

118
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:51,920
Thank you, very much.

119
00:20:12,273 --> 00:20:15,901
Hello. Who?

120
00:20:18,071 --> 00:20:23,828
Okay, put him on.
Yes. Mr. Martin?

121
00:20:23,869 --> 00:20:27,496
Well, I could, but I don't
particularly want to.

122
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:32,836
Yeah. All right.
I hope it's as vital to me.

123
00:21:21,843 --> 00:21:23,845
Mr. Martin?
Yes.

124
00:21:26,139 --> 00:21:28,016
Good evening.

125
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:30,810
Good of you to see me
at such a late hour,
Mr. Barrett.

126
00:21:30,851 --> 00:21:34,355
You didn't care
for a drink?
Oh, no, thank you.

127
00:21:34,398 --> 00:21:38,109
Do you live aboard
all the time, Mr. Barrett?

128
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,236
No, just some of the time.

129
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:45,616
I don't imagine
your law practice is
too demanding these days.

130
00:21:45,659 --> 00:21:48,161
Could be better.

131
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:52,373
Yet, you can
afford this yacht.
Must be rather expensive.

132
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,378
What can I do for you,
Mr. Martin?

133
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,466
We have a job for you.
We think you're the right man.

134
00:22:02,508 --> 00:22:05,261
Oh? Why?

135
00:22:05,304 --> 00:22:07,973
You have the background
for it.

136
00:22:08,014 --> 00:22:13,644
And in the past,
you've been quite outspoken
on the immorality of war.

137
00:22:13,686 --> 00:22:16,230
Everybody says
he's against war.

138
00:22:16,271 --> 00:22:21,194
Not ex-United States
Intelligence Officers.

139
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:24,948
Let's take a look
at some of the record.

140
00:22:24,989 --> 00:22:29,619
"Lee Barrett.
1950. University student.
Pre law."

141
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,996
"Then active service,
Korea and helicopters."

142
00:22:32,038 --> 00:22:35,375
"Detached for special service.
Excellent war record."

143
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:40,088
"Citation.
Superb lone operator
who has no master in cunning,"

144
00:22:40,129 --> 00:22:42,256
"secrecy or violence."

145
00:22:42,298 --> 00:22:47,136
"Promoted to captain.
Recommended for
three decorations."

146
00:22:47,178 --> 00:22:49,639
First discordant note.
Last two refused.

147
00:22:50,474 --> 00:22:54,478
You are quoted
as saying that war

148
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:59,483
"had aged you so fast,
you were too old
to play with toys."

149
00:23:01,735 --> 00:23:04,238
Rather a whimsical statement,
Mr. Barrett.

150
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,364
You think so?

151
00:23:06,405 --> 00:23:09,118
Why did you
leave the service?

152
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:10,910
Poor prospects.

153
00:23:13,704 --> 00:23:16,875
Discharged, 1952.

154
00:23:16,916 --> 00:23:22,839
Allowed to resign commission
after altercation with
a Major General.

155
00:23:22,881 --> 00:23:25,550
Some people
have flat feet.

156
00:23:25,591 --> 00:23:29,845
I dislike taking orders
under certain circumstances.

157
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:37,896
Then you got your law degree.
Passed the bar examination,
but didn't practice.

158
00:23:38,563 --> 00:23:40,815
Joined a government agency.

159
00:23:41,231 --> 00:23:42,901
Fired.

160
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:47,948
A stint with another one.
Fired for the usual reason.

161
00:23:47,989 --> 00:23:51,200
You rate rather high
on insubordination.

162
00:23:51,241 --> 00:23:54,995
My record is easy to check,
Mr. Martin. Make your point.

163
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,335
A year ago you were
appointed Security Chief
at Station Three.

164
00:24:01,376 --> 00:24:04,214
How do you know
about Station Three?

165
00:24:04,255 --> 00:24:08,926
The most secret
chemical warfare establishment
in this hemisphere.

166
00:24:11,011 --> 00:24:13,723
Fired three months ago.

167
00:24:13,764 --> 00:24:20,145
Reason? "Emotional rejection
of purpose of project."

168
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:26,151
"Council for World Peace."

169
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:28,696
"Henry Martin,
Executive Secretary."

170
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:30,239
You heard of us?

171
00:24:30,281 --> 00:24:31,908
Oh, yes.

172
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:34,410
MARTIN ON RADIO:
But you don't approve of us?

173
00:24:34,453 --> 00:24:37,580
BARRETT: I don't like
semi-secret organizations,
Mr. Martin.

174
00:24:37,621 --> 00:24:39,957
Neither do I,
Mr. Barrett.

175
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:43,919
But the Council is
a potent weapon for peace.

176
00:24:43,961 --> 00:24:48,341
We're not communistic
or anti-communistic.

177
00:24:49,425 --> 00:24:52,345
You just want
a workable peace.

178
00:24:52,386 --> 00:24:55,849
Like you, perhaps,
Mr. Barrett.

179
00:24:55,890 --> 00:25:00,770
You have been outspoken
on the foolishness of war.

180
00:25:05,108 --> 00:25:08,486
That was removed
from Station Three
a few hours ago.

181
00:25:08,528 --> 00:25:12,073
It doesn't matter
how at the moment.

182
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:14,825
Do you know
what it is?

183
00:25:19,122 --> 00:25:20,374
Botulinus?

184
00:25:20,415 --> 00:25:22,583
No.

185
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:26,004
A vaccine
against botulinus.

186
00:25:28,131 --> 00:25:32,760
The contents of
that flask can be cultured
to provide enough vaccine

187
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:35,596
to immunize
any nation on Earth.

188
00:25:37,306 --> 00:25:40,560
We want it delivered
to this address.

189
00:25:45,481 --> 00:25:48,192
Europe?
Yes.

190
00:25:48,234 --> 00:25:51,279
How does that help peace?

191
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,491
It neutralizes
a terrible weapon.

192
00:25:55,534 --> 00:26:00,955
If we both have it, well,
neither side can threaten
the other with it.

193
00:26:03,083 --> 00:26:06,169
Very dangerous assignment,
Mr. Martin.

194
00:26:09,255 --> 00:26:15,135
$10,000 should cover
your expenses.

195
00:26:17,805 --> 00:26:19,474
I'm afraid not.

196
00:26:19,515 --> 00:26:21,184
Then you refuse?

197
00:26:21,726 --> 00:26:23,103
No.

198
00:26:23,144 --> 00:26:30,359
It'll cost you 20,000.
10,000 each way. Cash. Now.

199
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:32,988
You mind if I say something,
Mr. Barrett?

200
00:26:33,029 --> 00:26:34,864
Yes, I do.

201
00:26:34,905 --> 00:26:36,490
Keep your speeches
and moralities
for your council.

202
00:26:36,531 --> 00:26:37,951
This is a business deal.

203
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:41,705
No wonder you were
thrown out of
so many places.

204
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:45,208
Satisfied?

205
00:26:45,249 --> 00:26:46,668
Yes.

206
00:26:48,878 --> 00:26:51,673
Put your forearms
on the table.

207
00:26:51,715 --> 00:26:55,134
You have a strange way
of doing business,
Mr. Barrett.

208
00:26:55,175 --> 00:26:57,178
What is this?
A holdup?

209
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:59,805
Put your forearms
on the table.

210
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:04,769
First, vaccines
are not stored
at Station Three.

211
00:27:04,810 --> 00:27:07,688
So this has got to be
some kind of a virus.

212
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:11,484
Second, no one's
supposed to know anything
about Station Three.

213
00:27:11,525 --> 00:27:16,405
And third,
I know quite a bit about
the World Peace Organization.

214
00:27:16,446 --> 00:27:20,869
There's a fat, balding man
who is the secretary,
name, Henry Martin.

215
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,996
I know him.

216
00:27:23,038 --> 00:27:25,247
What do you
intend to do?

217
00:27:25,289 --> 00:27:28,584
Turn you over
to the right people.

218
00:27:30,044 --> 00:27:32,546
I know this isn't evidence,

219
00:27:32,588 --> 00:27:37,885
but with your fingerprints
on the flask, and the money,
it'll do.

220
00:27:37,926 --> 00:27:39,887
MARTIN: I guess
I underestimated you.

221
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:42,098
I guess you did.
Now, stand up.

222
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:46,226
Turn around, put your hands on
the bulkhead and lean on them.

223
00:28:05,871 --> 00:28:08,249
(FOOTSTEPS)

224
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,426
Cavanaugh? What the hell
are you doing here?

225
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:20,970
Now, don't get sore, Barrett.
I had to do this in a hurry,

226
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:22,721
and it's the only way
I could handle it.

227
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:23,973
Handle what?

228
00:28:24,014 --> 00:28:27,476
I had to check you
for security and quick.

229
00:28:29,688 --> 00:28:33,108
That character's
one of your agents?
That's right.

230
00:28:33,149 --> 00:28:36,194
And you planned this
whole thing just to see
if I could be bought?

231
00:28:36,235 --> 00:28:38,696
You could put it
that way, I guess.

232
00:28:38,738 --> 00:28:41,365
I didn't know what kind of
a security risk you'd become.

233
00:28:41,406 --> 00:28:43,284
People change, you know.

234
00:28:43,326 --> 00:28:47,621
You did have me worried
on that radio there
for a moment.

235
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:50,290
Get out of here
and get your tail back
to Washington.

236
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:52,335
Mr. Barrett,
I'm Dr. Leonard Michaelson.

237
00:28:52,376 --> 00:28:55,129
I know who you are.
You, too. Get out.

238
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:58,341
Get your props
and get off this boat.

239
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:01,886
Barrett, you know the way
our security agency works.

240
00:29:01,928 --> 00:29:04,848
Mr. Barrett, I can understand
how you might interpret this

241
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:07,766
as a reflection
on your loyalty...
Sir.

242
00:29:07,808 --> 00:29:11,479
Barrett, the General has asked
that we come to you.

243
00:29:13,481 --> 00:29:15,566
He wants you
in on this.

244
00:29:16,942 --> 00:29:18,986
In on what?

245
00:29:19,028 --> 00:29:22,906
Station Three was broken into
a few hours ago.

246
00:29:22,948 --> 00:29:26,995
Reagan's been murdered
and Dr. Baxter has vanished.

247
00:29:57,608 --> 00:29:59,485
Mr. Michaelson?
Right.

248
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:02,946
I'm Pelton Tasserly,
Deputy Administrator here.
Mr. Tasserly.

249
00:30:02,988 --> 00:30:05,074
Lieutenant Raskin.
Lieutenant Johnson.

250
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:07,410
Good morning.
I'm very sorry
about this, sir.

251
00:30:07,451 --> 00:30:09,119
No sooner take over and...
Yes, yes, Tasserly.

252
00:30:09,161 --> 00:30:11,789
You know Mr. Cavanaugh?
Yes, I do.

253
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:15,209
Mr. Barrett?
Hello, Barrett.

254
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,794
Anything on Baxter?

255
00:30:16,835 --> 00:30:19,673
Nothing. But the net's out.
All points.

256
00:30:19,714 --> 00:30:21,256
What steps have you taken?

257
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,551
None, really. I figured
you'd get here pretty fast.

258
00:30:23,593 --> 00:30:26,304
So I've touched nothing,
talked to no one.

259
00:30:26,345 --> 00:30:29,599
I did bring in
all the security people
who were on duty last night.

260
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,643
Whom have you
told about this,
Mr. Tasserly?

261
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:35,020
Well, no one,
other than you people,

262
00:30:35,063 --> 00:30:36,855
and our security men,
of course.

263
00:30:36,898 --> 00:30:39,984
And Doctor Hoffman.
Why him?

264
00:30:40,025 --> 00:30:42,611
Well, he was the last one out,
except for the Director.

265
00:30:42,653 --> 00:30:44,948
He's waiting
in E block now.

266
00:30:44,989 --> 00:30:47,325
Let's take
a look at Reagan.

267
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:00,504
Are you with us,
Barrett?

268
00:31:00,545 --> 00:31:02,631
I'll be there
in a minute.

269
00:31:10,514 --> 00:31:13,351
How do you see this,
Johnson?

270
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:19,983
Well, Mr. Tasserly says,
and Mason swears that
nobody got into E Lab.

271
00:31:20,024 --> 00:31:22,860
But I don't think Reagan
committed suicide in there.

272
00:31:22,901 --> 00:31:25,905
Neither do I.
What's the sentry dog
doing over here?

273
00:31:25,946 --> 00:31:28,908
He's got a lump on his head
that wasn't there yesterday.

274
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:33,246
But he was still on patrol
this morning?
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:31:33,288 --> 00:31:37,000
I think maybe
he might've been
knocked cold for awhile.

276
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:40,836
Of course, being a dog,
he couldn't tell me about it.
He just went back to work.

277
00:31:40,879 --> 00:31:42,838
Yeah.

278
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,090
Has Raskin got men
going over the fence?

279
00:31:45,133 --> 00:31:46,968
Every inch.

280
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:03,817
Right in that corner, sir.

281
00:32:17,747 --> 00:32:22,086
Dr. Hoffman's
terribly distraught.
Insists he must talk to you.

282
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:24,088
Immediately, in private.

283
00:32:24,129 --> 00:32:26,340
Perhaps you should
see him, sir.

284
00:32:26,381 --> 00:32:28,008
Hmm.

285
00:32:31,761 --> 00:32:34,640
Dr. Hoffman,
this is Dr. Michaelson.

286
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,619
How was it done?

287
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,911
Blow on the head.
No weapon.

288
00:32:58,539 --> 00:33:00,165
Who set the time lock?

289
00:33:00,208 --> 00:33:03,085
I don't know, sir.
I suppose Dr. Baxter.

290
00:33:03,126 --> 00:33:05,713
Another half an hour to go.

291
00:33:05,754 --> 00:33:07,715
Is there any way
to work that combination

292
00:33:07,756 --> 00:33:10,175
and go in before
the time is up?

293
00:33:10,218 --> 00:33:12,511
We've got to find out
if anything has
happened in there.

294
00:33:12,552 --> 00:33:16,349
No way on earth
until those red lights
go off at 8:00.

295
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:20,185
You fool with that
door before that,
well, you'd die quick.

296
00:33:20,228 --> 00:33:24,148
It's booby trapped.
A thousand volt charge
and lethal gas.

297
00:33:24,189 --> 00:33:26,316
JOHNSON ON PA: Mr. Raskin.
Yes?

298
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,235
We've found
a break in the fence.

299
00:33:28,276 --> 00:33:30,905
Don't touch it.
We'll be right there.
Yes, sir.

300
00:33:30,946 --> 00:33:33,115
CAVANAUGH: Raskin,
have your men
move Reagan's body

301
00:33:33,156 --> 00:33:34,743
to one of
the side laboratories.

302
00:33:34,784 --> 00:33:36,410
RASKIN: Yes, sir.

303
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:44,710
CAVANAUGH: Taped.

304
00:33:44,753 --> 00:33:47,004
So that you
can't even see it
unless you look closely.

305
00:33:48,088 --> 00:33:50,340
Very careful job.

306
00:33:50,383 --> 00:33:52,760
Raskin, open
the other side.

307
00:33:54,638 --> 00:33:59,058
Cut left to right.
A right-handed man, maybe.

308
00:33:59,099 --> 00:34:03,771
Or a left-handed man
who wants us to think
he's right-handed, maybe.

309
00:34:11,945 --> 00:34:15,699
The alarm didn't go off.
The wire hasn't been
touched anywhere.

310
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,035
Someone'd really have to know
their way around this place

311
00:34:18,076 --> 00:34:20,579
not to trip over this
at night.

312
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:22,831
RASKIN: The thing
I don't understand,

313
00:34:22,872 --> 00:34:25,543
is how anybody
can get past the dog.

314
00:34:25,584 --> 00:34:27,336
I don't get that, either.

315
00:34:27,378 --> 00:34:30,130
What do you
think happened?

316
00:34:30,173 --> 00:34:31,590
I don't know, sir.

317
00:34:31,631 --> 00:34:33,426
BARRETT: What's his name?
Rollo.

318
00:34:33,468 --> 00:34:37,430
Can I handle him?
He's under sedation.
Go ahead.

319
00:34:40,515 --> 00:34:45,145
Easy, Rollo.
Easy, boy.
Easy, Rollo.

320
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:48,356
Easy. Easy.

321
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:50,192
(WHIMPERING)

322
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:51,110
There it is.

323
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,404
What do you
make of that?

324
00:34:53,446 --> 00:34:54,948
Hmm.

325
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:01,954
Those are cuts.
How'd they get there?

326
00:35:01,995 --> 00:35:03,539
CAVANAUGH: From the wire.

327
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:04,874
Right.

328
00:35:06,416 --> 00:35:08,919
Raskin, you be Rollo.

329
00:35:12,381 --> 00:35:15,593
Now, you tape up your arm,
stick it through, thus...

330
00:35:15,634 --> 00:35:17,678
Okay, grab it.

331
00:35:19,304 --> 00:35:21,890
You hang up Rollo
on the wires
so he can't pull free

332
00:35:21,931 --> 00:35:23,726
without tearing
his throat out.

333
00:35:23,768 --> 00:35:26,645
CAVANAUGH: He'd make a noise.
No. These dogs are trained
not to bark.

334
00:35:26,686 --> 00:35:27,896
No matter what. Right?
JOHNSON: Right.

335
00:35:27,938 --> 00:35:30,524
Then you clobber him
with something heavy,

336
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:33,861
you tape up the wire
and you're gone.

337
00:35:33,903 --> 00:35:37,198
When Rollo comes to,
he's got the world's
most massive headache.

338
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,075
But being a dog,
he can't tell anybody

339
00:35:40,118 --> 00:35:42,953
so he just goes
back to work. Simple.

340
00:35:44,038 --> 00:35:45,414
So that's how he got in.

341
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:48,125
BARRETT: No.
That's how he got out.
Out?

342
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:50,378
Right. Look at the ends
of these wires
where they're bent.

343
00:35:50,419 --> 00:35:53,088
He took Rollo
from the inside.

344
00:35:55,674 --> 00:36:00,013
Mr. Barrett,
a telegram for you.
It came to our office in town.

345
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:02,515
How come you get
a telegram here?

346
00:36:02,556 --> 00:36:03,808
Magic.

347
00:36:07,228 --> 00:36:09,730
I'd certainly like to know
what it says.

348
00:36:09,773 --> 00:36:11,649
I'll bet you would.

349
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:14,944
Mr. Cavanaugh,
it's 10 minutes to 8:00.

350
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,991
I know it is
an outside possibility,

351
00:36:21,034 --> 00:36:24,328
but it is a possibility
and a horrible one.

352
00:36:24,369 --> 00:36:29,124
And you cannot just
kick it under the rug.
You have not the right...

353
00:36:32,836 --> 00:36:35,548
CAVANAUGH: What is it?

354
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:39,343
We have a very difficult
situation here.

355
00:36:39,384 --> 00:36:42,971
Dr. Hoffman feels
that E Lab should be
sealed in concrete.

356
00:36:43,013 --> 00:36:44,639
Why?

357
00:36:44,681 --> 00:36:48,018
Because he's afraid
that some chemicals
in that vault

358
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:50,188
may have been
broken or tampered with.

359
00:36:50,229 --> 00:36:53,649
Even if they weren't,
we still cannot
take the chance.

360
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:57,570
The possibilities are
too monstrous to gamble with.

361
00:36:57,611 --> 00:37:00,239
What possibilities?

362
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:06,454
I think you better
tell them, Doctor.

363
00:37:06,495 --> 00:37:09,958
(SIGHING)

364
00:37:09,999 --> 00:37:16,671
More than 40
bio-chemical weapons have been
developed at Station Three.

365
00:37:16,714 --> 00:37:21,885
I will confine myself
to two which we have
developed here in E Lab.

366
00:37:22,428 --> 00:37:25,514
First, botulinus.

367
00:37:25,555 --> 00:37:30,019
We have 1,200 grams
in six flasks.

368
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,773
If 10 grams of it
were allowed to
contaminate a city,

369
00:37:33,814 --> 00:37:36,441
that city is a morgue
in four hours.

370
00:37:38,151 --> 00:37:44,491
It is an ideal weapon,
God forgive the phrase,

371
00:37:44,533 --> 00:37:48,370
because it destroys
only people.

372
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:55,794
And it oxidizes itself.
In effect, dies, disappears
after eight hours.

373
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:57,671
Well, then,
it's safe to go in there.

374
00:37:57,713 --> 00:38:01,341
It's been over eight hours
since that vault door
was closed.

375
00:38:01,384 --> 00:38:04,719
And if all 1,200 grams of
the botulinus were spilled
on the floor,

376
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:07,890
it would still be safe.

377
00:38:07,931 --> 00:38:12,645
The closed air circulating
system is still in operation.
So it would be oxidized.

378
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:18,525
That is correct. But there is
something else in there.

379
00:38:18,566 --> 00:38:24,531
It is only three weeks
since Dr. Baxter refined it
and only three days

380
00:38:24,573 --> 00:38:28,744
since he communicated
its existence to anyone.

381
00:38:28,786 --> 00:38:32,330
There's something beyond
the botulinus?

382
00:38:32,373 --> 00:38:35,793
Yes, the second weapon.

383
00:38:35,834 --> 00:38:39,088
Also a virus, air borne.

384
00:38:39,129 --> 00:38:43,466
But self-perpetuating.
Indestructible.

385
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:48,806
Once released, it will
multiply at a power
beyond our calculations.

386
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:52,643
It perhaps, will never die.

387
00:38:52,685 --> 00:38:57,314
To this virus, we have given
a highly unscientific name,

388
00:38:57,355 --> 00:39:01,569
but one which
describes it perfectly.

389
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,863
The Satan Bug.

390
00:39:05,614 --> 00:39:10,244
If I took the flask
which contains it
and exposed it to the air,

391
00:39:10,285 --> 00:39:13,706
everyone here
would be dead
in a few seconds.

392
00:39:13,748 --> 00:39:17,501
California would be a tomb
in a few hours.

393
00:39:18,335 --> 00:39:20,670
In a week,

394
00:39:20,713 --> 00:39:24,633
all life,
and I mean all life,

395
00:39:24,674 --> 00:39:28,470
would cease
in the United States.

396
00:39:28,511 --> 00:39:32,306
In two months,
two months at the most,

397
00:39:32,349 --> 00:39:36,354
the trapper in Alaska,
the peasant on the Yangtze,

398
00:39:36,395 --> 00:39:38,939
the aborigine in Australia,
dead.

399
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:41,609
All dead.

400
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:48,824
Because I crushed the flask
and exposed a green
colored liquid to the air.

401
00:39:48,866 --> 00:39:52,911
Nothing, nothing can stop
the Satan Bug.

402
00:39:52,953 --> 00:39:56,624
What would be
the last to go?

403
00:39:56,665 --> 00:40:02,546
Perhaps a great albatross
winging it's way around
the bottom of the world.

404
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:05,549
Perhaps an Eskimo
deep in the Arctic.

405
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:12,723
But the seas travel
the world over
and so do the winds.

406
00:40:12,765 --> 00:40:17,101
One day, one day soon,
they, too, would die.

407
00:40:18,729 --> 00:40:21,274
The Satan Bug is
behind that door.

408
00:40:21,315 --> 00:40:26,320
One flask.
It has got to be locked up.
It has got to be.

409
00:40:26,361 --> 00:40:29,073
I must make you understand.

410
00:40:29,114 --> 00:40:32,075
If botulinus is spilled,
as Mr. Barrett here
has just said,

411
00:40:32,116 --> 00:40:34,619
then it does not matter.

412
00:40:34,661 --> 00:40:38,623
But, by God,
if someone did
get in there,

413
00:40:38,665 --> 00:40:42,795
and the Satan Bug is spilled,
and the vault door
opened half an inch

414
00:40:42,836 --> 00:40:47,465
and left open,
then the airlock room
is lethal.

415
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:51,429
Open this door for more than
five seconds

416
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:56,891
and everything
that I have told you
will happen, will happen.

417
00:40:56,934 --> 00:41:00,938
I beg you, sir,
seal up the door.
You cannot take the risk.

418
00:41:04,191 --> 00:41:07,611
I agree. There's
nothing else we can do.

419
00:41:07,653 --> 00:41:09,279
We've no option.

420
00:41:09,321 --> 00:41:13,700
We've no option,
but to make sure
it's in there and untouched.

421
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:17,996
(SQUEAKING)

422
00:41:21,124 --> 00:41:23,126
All right,
you're all set.

423
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:35,514
Barrett,
if that hamster does die,
you'll be contaminated.

424
00:41:35,555 --> 00:41:39,476
You won't be able
to come out of there.

425
00:41:39,518 --> 00:41:40,728
I know.

426
00:41:40,769 --> 00:41:42,104
Well, I trust your intentions,

427
00:41:42,145 --> 00:41:45,940
but if there is
something wrong in there, I...

428
00:41:45,983 --> 00:41:49,736
You wonder if I can
go through staying in there?

429
00:41:49,778 --> 00:41:52,155
Yes.
So do I.

430
00:41:54,116 --> 00:41:56,369
Eric, do you have your gun?

431
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:59,746
If I come out of that vault
with this face mask down,

432
00:41:59,788 --> 00:42:03,458
open that airlock door
just a crack and use it.

433
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:05,335
It's below atmospheric
pressure in there,

434
00:42:05,378 --> 00:42:08,255
so the outside air
will rush in.

435
00:42:08,296 --> 00:42:13,844
You'll have time.
You'll be safe.

436
00:42:13,886 --> 00:42:17,055
Lee, you know
if I have to,
I will use this.

437
00:42:17,931 --> 00:42:19,308
I know.

438
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,464

There's no danger.

He's dead.

(SQUEAKING)

Botulinus.

445
00:46:32,601 --> 00:46:36,398
There was
a accident last month,
a technician.

446
00:46:36,439 --> 00:46:37,983
Oh, no, it is all right.

447
00:46:38,025 --> 00:46:41,861
There's just the odor now.
It's oxidized.

448
00:46:42,988 --> 00:46:45,865
What about
the Satan Bug, Dr. Hoffman?

449
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:55,543
Don't touch
the handle, Doctor.
We need fingerprints.

450
00:47:10,139 --> 00:47:11,934
It is gone.

451
00:47:12,809 --> 00:47:15,352
And the botulinus.

452
00:47:15,395 --> 00:47:20,693
All the flasks.
Yes. They are all gone.

453
00:47:20,734 --> 00:47:25,864
It can't be gone.
It can't be.
It's impossible.

454
00:47:25,905 --> 00:47:27,991
Baxter walked out
last night.

455
00:47:28,033 --> 00:47:29,701
He was checked out. He was!

456
00:47:29,743 --> 00:47:31,661

walked out.

457

Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm Lee Barrett.

458

You're in suite 15.

459
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,465
I am?
Yes, sir.

460
00:48:27,341 --> 00:48:30,303
You're already registered.

461
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:32,221
I am?
You certainly are.

462
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:34,724
Hello, Lee, darling.

463
00:48:41,774 --> 00:48:43,191
Thank you, very much.

464
00:48:43,233 --> 00:48:44,901
Don't mention it.

465
00:48:47,988 --> 00:48:49,572
I thought you'd
never get here.

466

I've read the newspaper
three times and had
four cups of coffee.

00:48:53,535 --> 00:48:55,244
Well, I hope
you saved one for me.

468
00:48:55,286 --> 00:48:57,080
I certainly did.

469
00:49:05,254 --> 00:49:08,008
What the hell
are you doing here?

470
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:10,969
I'm using a new strategy,
darling.

471
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:15,389
I thought you might like
the Mata Hari type.

472
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:18,185
But that telegram,
"The sooner the better."

473
00:49:18,226 --> 00:49:21,270
Can you think of a better way
to get you here fast?

474
00:49:21,313 --> 00:49:23,648
At least you
could've signed it, damn it.

475
00:49:23,690 --> 00:49:27,485
Hey, your language
hasn't improved a bit,
by the way.

476
00:49:27,526 --> 00:49:31,239
You need a wife's influence.

477
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:33,991
Ann, honey,
what are you doing here?

478
00:49:34,033 --> 00:49:37,286
Isn't this a beautiful part
of the desert?

479
00:49:37,329 --> 00:49:40,708
It's marvelous,
almost a hideaway.

480
00:49:41,458 --> 00:49:42,791
Where is he?

481
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:45,419
About 10 miles from here.

482
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:48,005
Well, who's the cover
this time?

483
00:49:48,381 --> 00:49:50,341
Me.

484
00:49:50,383 --> 00:49:52,426
You?

485
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:55,221
You know, you're not
very bright this morning,
Lee, darling

486
00:49:55,263 --> 00:49:57,890
and you're certainly not
a bit flattering.

487
00:49:57,931 --> 00:50:02,020
You and I are spending
a quiet little weekend here.

488
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:05,023
Supposedly.

489
00:50:05,608 --> 00:50:07,234
Oh.

490
00:50:08,651 --> 00:50:10,820
What is it this time, Lee?

491
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:14,281
It's not good.

492
00:50:14,324 --> 00:50:16,034
Why didn't you say so?

493
00:50:16,075 --> 00:50:19,245
I know a darling place
out in the desert for lunch.

494
00:50:19,286 --> 00:50:23,250
Green pepper burritos
and cold Mexican beer.

495
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:24,751
Ole.

496
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:09,379
Oh, hello, Ann, darling.
Good morning, Dad.

497
00:51:09,421 --> 00:51:11,173
Good morning, sir.
Good to see you again.

498
00:51:11,214 --> 00:51:13,508
Hello, Lee.
It's good to see you.
Sit down.

499
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,510
Thank you.
That's it for
romance today, Lee.

500
00:51:16,553 --> 00:51:18,221
I'll get your breakfast.
No, that can wait.

501
00:51:18,263 --> 00:51:21,349
Sit down, Ann.
There's no reason
why you shouldn't hear this.

502
00:51:21,390 --> 00:51:23,768
It didn't take you
long to get here
from Washington.

503
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:28,231
No. I'm a member of
the Mach two club now.
A little over two hours.

504
00:51:28,273 --> 00:51:33,110
No, Ann came ahead of me.
I was going to talk to Baxter.

505
00:51:33,153 --> 00:51:35,822
We've just learned
of the Satan Bug.

506
00:51:35,864 --> 00:51:38,450
Baxter hadn't told you?

507
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:43,163
No, not until three days ago.
He was quite disturbed.

508
00:51:43,205 --> 00:51:47,084
So were all of us.
A difficult decision.

509
00:51:47,125 --> 00:51:50,754
Didn't know what to do.
Destroy it or not.

510
00:51:54,173 --> 00:51:57,426
Is it gone?
Yes, sir.
And all the botulinus.

511
00:52:00,221 --> 00:52:02,015
And I warned him.

512
00:52:02,056 --> 00:52:05,810
You set a project
like this in motion,
something has to blow.

513
00:52:05,853 --> 00:52:07,436
You think Baxter took it?

514
00:52:07,479 --> 00:52:10,733
No, I found him in the lab.
He's dead.

515
00:52:11,941 --> 00:52:13,568
Baxter's dead?

516
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:15,945
Somehow two men
got into E Lab yesterday.

517
00:52:15,988 --> 00:52:19,783
They must've found
Baxter there alone,
just before closing.

518
00:52:19,824 --> 00:52:22,494
One of them
threw the flask at him
and then shut the vault door,

519
00:52:22,535 --> 00:52:25,079
then he walked out
as Baxter.

520
00:52:25,121 --> 00:52:26,705
As Baxter?
There must've been

521
00:52:26,748 --> 00:52:30,710
a reasonable resemblance,
and with Baxter's hat
and coat,

522
00:52:30,753 --> 00:52:32,795
everybody expected
to see Baxter.

523
00:52:32,836 --> 00:52:34,130
So they saw Baxter.

524
00:52:34,171 --> 00:52:35,924
And?

525
00:52:35,965 --> 00:52:38,968
The other man
went through the fence
with the stuff.

526
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:42,514
Reagan must've stumbled
on them in the lab.

527
00:52:46,893 --> 00:52:49,938
Does Cavanaugh
have any ideas?

528
00:52:49,979 --> 00:52:51,523
None. But he's
all over the place

529
00:52:51,564 --> 00:52:53,900
with fingerprint men
and cameras.

530
00:52:53,941 --> 00:52:57,279
He'll interrogate everything,
everybody, but he won't
come up with anything

531
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,489
that will be of any value.

532
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:03,451
You agree
that it was an inside job?

533
00:53:03,493 --> 00:53:06,370
Certainly an inside assist,
but too smooth to be caught

534
00:53:06,413 --> 00:53:08,331
by fingerprints
and conversation.

535
00:53:08,373 --> 00:53:10,708
Anyhow, sir, as you know,

536
00:53:10,750 --> 00:53:14,546
the "how" is not important,
it's the "who"
and the "why" that counts.

537
00:53:14,587 --> 00:53:15,798
Yes.

538
00:53:17,049 --> 00:53:18,841
Lee,

539
00:53:18,883 --> 00:53:22,720
have they told you
just what this
new virus will do?

540
00:53:22,761 --> 00:53:24,889
Dr. Hoffman filled me in.

541
00:53:28,351 --> 00:53:31,563
It's throwing that botulinus
that worries me.

542
00:53:31,604 --> 00:53:33,440
That's the work
of a lunatic.

543
00:53:33,481 --> 00:53:34,941
There're three
possibilities.

544
00:53:34,983 --> 00:53:37,319
Foreign power, possible.

545
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,196
Criminals, hijackers,
improbable.

546
00:53:40,238 --> 00:53:42,615
It's the first
and the third
that bother me.

547
00:53:42,656 --> 00:53:45,618
What's the third?
Well, you said it,
a lunatic.

548
00:53:45,659 --> 00:53:49,205
Well, psychotics
don't generally engage
in team work like this.

549
00:53:49,246 --> 00:53:52,791
Paranoids do,
and they're very brilliant,
some of them.

550
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:54,961
What sort of paranoid?

551
00:53:55,003 --> 00:53:57,671
The kind that we grow
the most of in this country.

552
00:53:57,714 --> 00:53:59,298
A messiah.

553
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,384
What kind of messiah?

554
00:54:01,425 --> 00:54:03,094
Take your pick.

555
00:54:03,135 --> 00:54:06,180
Extreme right,
extreme left.

556
00:54:06,223 --> 00:54:08,891
From the
"I'd rather be Red
than Dead" fanatics

557
00:54:08,932 --> 00:54:12,395
to "Bomb Moscow
right now" fanatics.

558
00:54:12,436 --> 00:54:14,939
My choice, a messiah.

559
00:54:14,981 --> 00:54:17,941
Let's say you're right.
What next?

560
00:54:17,984 --> 00:54:22,446
A telegram,
a letter, or something
to the papers with,

561
00:54:22,489 --> 00:54:27,119
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

562
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:31,248
And they'll make demands
and end up with,
"Obey or else."

563
00:54:33,541 --> 00:54:36,210
Where were you
at midnight last night?

564
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:40,089
I beg your pardon?

565
00:54:40,131 --> 00:54:43,468
This was delivered
about 10 minutes ago.

566
00:54:43,510 --> 00:54:49,766
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

567
00:54:49,807 --> 00:54:51,893
"I have what
you're looking for."

568
00:54:51,934 --> 00:54:57,023
"I order your Citadel
of the Antichrist destroyed."

569
00:54:57,064 --> 00:55:01,944
"The President
will publicly announce
immediate compliance."

570
00:55:01,985 --> 00:55:06,949
"To prove that
I am to be obeyed,
there will be an incident."

571
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:08,284
Unsigned.

572
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:37,646
They were carried in.
Routine delivery of crates.

573
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:39,565
Carried in!

574
00:55:39,606 --> 00:55:41,068
Phony.

575
00:55:41,109 --> 00:55:43,695
My God, Mr. Barrett,
we had no way of knowing.

576
00:55:43,736 --> 00:55:47,574
We had no idea
they'd do anything like this.
No idea at all. It's...

577
00:55:47,615 --> 00:55:49,241
It's so simple
it's ridiculous.

578
00:55:49,283 --> 00:55:51,744
It's always the simple way
that works.

579
00:55:51,785 --> 00:55:53,161
Nothing?
MAN: Nothing.

580
00:55:53,204 --> 00:55:55,206
Only the fingerprints
that belong here.

581
00:55:55,248 --> 00:55:59,919
The crates were coded
with the right number,
the right color.

582
00:55:59,961 --> 00:56:04,048
And they were delivered
late Friday afternoon,
at 5:35.

583
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:06,343
No reason for the technicians
to open them.

584
00:56:06,384 --> 00:56:07,801
Exactly.

585
00:56:07,844 --> 00:56:09,971
We're just to see
that nothing gets out.

586
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:13,306
Nothing. Everything that
comes in stays...

587
00:56:13,349 --> 00:56:15,601
Eric.

588
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:25,361
The General's here.
He got this this morning.

589
00:56:26,904 --> 00:56:30,116
It was phoned in last night.

590
00:56:30,158 --> 00:56:32,369
Pay phone,
Los Angeles Airport.

591
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:36,664
My God.

592
00:56:39,208 --> 00:56:41,544
How did they even know
he was here?

593
00:56:41,585 --> 00:56:44,671
Good question.

594
00:56:44,714 --> 00:56:48,259
Well, there's only
one thing to do.
Rip this whole place apart.

595
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:51,388
Get everybody in here.
Everyone else connected
with this place.

596
00:56:51,429 --> 00:56:56,559
Work them over. Meanwhile,
we'll keep the whole area
completely sealed off.

597
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,186
I think, except for
sealing off the area,

598
00:56:59,228 --> 00:57:02,399
we should do
the exact opposite.

599
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,525
What do you mean?

600
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:08,863
Everybody here, at E Lab,
knows exactly what happened.

601
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:12,115
Certainly whoever
took the bugs know.

602
00:57:12,158 --> 00:57:15,244
But nobody outside
knows anything yet.

603
00:57:15,286 --> 00:57:18,414
Keep it that way.
Leave it wide open.

604
00:57:18,455 --> 00:57:22,294
Why?
So we don't force
anybody underground.

605
00:57:22,335 --> 00:57:27,299
Eric, there's got to be
at least an inside assist
from someone here

606
00:57:27,340 --> 00:57:29,759
at Station Three.

607
00:57:29,801 --> 00:57:32,429
Whoever it is,
let's keep them
in the dark.

608
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:34,889
Let's hope they make
a move, and if they do,
we'll know it.

609
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:38,184
It may be the break
we're looking for.

610
00:57:38,225 --> 00:57:41,395
Pretty dangerous, Lee.
Lot of ways to make a slip.

611
00:57:41,438 --> 00:57:45,191
You know how long it'll take
to interrogate everybody.

612
00:57:45,233 --> 00:57:49,988
Cross check stories,
and run down leads.
We're under a time gun.

613
00:57:50,029 --> 00:57:53,950
You cannot conduct this
like a normal investigation.

614
00:57:53,991 --> 00:57:58,454
We've got to hope
that somebody, somehow,
will lead us to the bugs.

615
00:57:58,495 --> 00:58:02,750
Only the flasks are important,
nothing else.

616
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:03,585
What do we say
about Baxter?

617
00:58:03,626 --> 00:58:04,626
Tell them nothing.

618
00:58:04,668 --> 00:58:08,046
What about this?
It doesn't exist.

619
00:58:11,175 --> 00:58:13,051
(SIGHING)

620
00:58:15,304 --> 00:58:17,556
I'll give the word
to Raskin.

621
00:58:19,682 --> 00:58:21,144
CAVANAUGH: Raskin.

622
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:40,496
Anything, Mr. Barrett?

623
00:58:40,538 --> 00:58:42,831
Mr. Cavanaugh will be in
in a moment.

624
00:58:42,874 --> 00:58:46,001
That was a very
brave thing you did,
Mr. Barrett.

625
00:58:46,043 --> 00:58:48,170
To go into that vault.

626
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:51,715
Maybe I knew
there wasn't any risk.
How could you know that?

627
00:58:51,758 --> 00:58:53,384
Well, certainly,
whoever planned this
had accurate information.

628
00:58:53,425 --> 00:58:56,763
Very accurate information.

629
00:58:56,804 --> 00:59:01,518
Like me you mean?
I'd put me at the top
of the list.

630
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:04,436
Why would you steal
the Satan Bug, Mr. Barrett?

631
00:59:04,478 --> 00:59:07,649
Possession gives one
limitless power.

632
00:59:08,106 --> 00:59:09,650
Military power?

633
00:59:09,691 --> 00:59:12,945
And political power
and limitless wealth.

634
00:59:12,986 --> 00:59:17,825
The Satan Bug could
make one god on earth,
or the devil, if you please.

635
00:59:17,866 --> 00:59:20,994
Isn't that enough
to tempt anyone?

636
00:59:21,036 --> 00:59:22,871
Dr. Hoffman, how long
will it take us to develop

637
00:59:22,914 --> 00:59:26,125
a vaccine against
the Satan Bug?

638
00:59:26,168 --> 00:59:30,337
As a scientist,
I cannot say never, but...

639
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:35,093
Dr. Baxter was
not getting anywhere,
none of us were.

640
00:59:35,134 --> 00:59:38,554
Tasserly,
institute a crash program.

641
00:59:38,595 --> 00:59:41,307
Now.
Yes, sir.

642
00:59:47,689 --> 00:59:50,274
Sir, except
for those present,

643
00:59:50,316 --> 00:59:53,861
we're taking
the official position
that nothing is missing.

644
00:59:53,903 --> 00:59:56,572
There's been a murder,
that's all.

645
00:59:56,614 --> 00:59:58,365
We say nothing
to anyone.

646
00:59:58,406 --> 01:00:01,076
A murder?
What about Dr. Baxter?

647
01:00:01,118 --> 01:00:06,708
There's a dead body in there.
It'll keep till Monday.
Dr. Baxter's just missing.

648
01:00:06,749 --> 01:00:09,835
Meanwhile, of course,
we'll proceed with
the investigation.

649
01:00:09,876 --> 01:00:12,589
How?
The usual way.

650
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:15,466
What are we
supposed to do?

651
01:00:15,508 --> 01:00:19,470
What do you propose,
Mr. Tasserly?

652
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:24,391
I think I will stay here
at Station Three,
if you do not object.

653
01:00:24,432 --> 01:00:28,186
I'm very tired,
and I do not feel
like going home.

654
01:00:28,229 --> 01:00:29,855
TASSERLY: I'll go with you.

655
01:00:29,896 --> 01:00:32,441
Somehow, I...

656
01:00:32,484 --> 01:00:34,401
Well, I should
like to be on call.

657
01:00:34,443 --> 01:00:38,364
I will be in D Wing rest area.
Do not hesitate to awaken me.

658
01:00:38,405 --> 01:00:40,991
Very well.

659
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:43,244
The General is here,
Dr. Michaelson.

660
01:00:43,285 --> 01:00:47,665
All of this is being
transmitted to Washington
in detail.

661
01:00:47,706 --> 01:00:51,378
All right. I'll be
in administration
with Tasserly.

662
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:54,296
Station Three personnel?

663
01:00:54,337 --> 01:00:55,839
Yes.

664
01:00:57,675 --> 01:01:00,261
That telegram.

665
01:01:00,303 --> 01:01:06,016
Could there have been a leak?
I mean, you don't think
it was a phony, do you?

666
01:01:06,057 --> 01:01:11,273
It could be a maneuver.
The bugs are gone.

667
01:01:12,815 --> 01:01:16,778
A lunatic
with the killer of all times.

668
01:01:18,154 --> 01:01:20,281
Gives me the creeps.

669
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:24,535
This whole operation
gives me the creeps.

670
01:02:26,096 --> 01:02:28,640
How was Florida?

671
01:02:28,681 --> 01:02:31,059
Okay.
Quick trip.

672
01:02:33,270 --> 01:02:36,148
No quicker than
it was scheduled.

673
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:39,110
How'd you make out?

674
01:02:39,151 --> 01:02:41,529
I made out fine.

675
01:02:45,031 --> 01:02:46,450
Where's Ainsley?

676
01:02:46,493 --> 01:02:47,994
I don't know.

677
01:02:48,953 --> 01:02:50,621
When did he get here?

678
01:02:50,663 --> 01:02:52,123
He didn't.

679
01:02:54,833 --> 01:02:56,544
What do you mean,
he didn't?

680
01:02:56,585 --> 01:02:58,545
I mean
he didn't get here.

681
01:02:58,586 --> 01:03:01,173
And he didn't call.

682
01:03:02,841 --> 01:03:04,926
Did you call him?

683
01:03:04,968 --> 01:03:06,513
No, I didn't.

684
01:03:39,586 --> 01:03:41,839
(PHONE RINGING)

685
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,960
Hello.

686
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:21,920
Yeah, this is
Dr. Ostrer's house.

687
01:04:21,963 --> 01:04:26,468
Oh, I'm just
the air conditioning man.
I'm fixing the unit.

688
01:04:26,509 --> 01:04:31,304
Well, he just stepped out.
He said he'd be right back.
Can I take a message?

689
01:04:32,514 --> 01:04:34,932
To call who?

690
01:04:34,975 --> 01:04:38,561
Ah, Ainsley?
How do you spell that?
A-N-S...

691
01:04:39,188 --> 01:04:43,025
A-I-N-S-L-E-Y.

692
01:04:43,066 --> 01:04:46,613
Ah, that's right, Mr. Ainsley.
What number?

693
01:04:46,654 --> 01:04:48,614
(PHONE CLICKS)

694
01:05:02,503 --> 01:05:04,588
What the hell
are you doing here?

695
01:05:04,630 --> 01:05:08,300
Do you usually make
a habit of hanging around
people's swimming pools?

696
01:05:08,341 --> 01:05:10,553
I do when I see that.

697
01:05:32,741 --> 01:05:34,493
Is that Ostrer?

698
01:05:34,535 --> 01:05:36,704
Yeah. They wiped him out.

699
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:42,584
Could he have been
the inside assist?

700
01:05:43,919 --> 01:05:45,879
Could be.

701
01:06:15,451 --> 01:06:18,036
Cavanaugh, please.

702
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,000
Cavanaugh, Barrett here.
I'm at Ostrer's. He's dead.

703
01:06:23,041 --> 01:06:26,588
It's murder to me,
but it looks like
it could be suicide.

704
01:06:26,629 --> 01:06:28,714
He's floating
at the bottom of the pool.

705
01:06:28,755 --> 01:06:32,300
I'll fill you in
on the details later,
but more important,

706
01:06:32,343 --> 01:06:36,723
see if you can check
a call that just came in
to this number a minute ago.

707
01:06:36,764 --> 01:06:39,766
What does the name
Ainsley mean to you?

708
01:06:39,807 --> 01:06:42,769
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

709
01:06:42,811 --> 01:06:45,939
Uh-huh. That's him.
Millionaire crank.

710
01:06:45,981 --> 01:06:48,859
Right at the top of the list
of crackpots.

711
01:06:48,900 --> 01:06:51,654
A place in New York,
Santa Barbara and another one,

712
01:06:51,695 --> 01:06:55,408
I think, somewhere outside
of Phoenix. Nail him.

713
01:06:55,449 --> 01:06:57,994
Don't touch him,
but don't let him
out of your sight.

714
01:06:58,035 --> 01:07:02,248
And don't let him know
he's being followed. Okay.

715
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:07,585
Now, honey,
what are you doing here?

716
01:07:07,628 --> 01:07:09,630
I was looking for you.

717
01:07:11,006 --> 01:07:12,758
The incident?

718
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:14,885
Florida.

719
01:07:21,893 --> 01:07:23,644
GENERAL: Well,
it's happened, Lee.

720
01:07:23,685 --> 01:07:27,023
Key West, Florida.
About an hour
and a half ago.

721
01:07:27,064 --> 01:07:29,816
We have helicopters
in the area

722
01:07:29,858 --> 01:07:34,446
making 16 millimeter films
of everything they can see
from the air.

723
01:07:34,488 --> 01:07:36,949
Meanwhile, the coast line
is blocked off

724
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:41,536
and we're at the present time
clearing the ocean for
200 miles off shore.

725
01:07:41,578 --> 01:07:43,289
How'd it happen?

726
01:07:43,330 --> 01:07:45,374
Nobody seems to know, exactly.

727
01:07:45,416 --> 01:07:47,919
One reports says
there was a small explosion.

728
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,879
Then everyone downwind
started dying.

729
01:07:50,921 --> 01:07:52,924
We've closed down
all the news media,

730
01:07:52,965 --> 01:07:56,134
but we won't be able to
keep it quiet for long.

731
01:07:56,176 --> 01:07:58,470
What's the attitude
in Washington?

732
01:07:58,511 --> 01:08:02,307
I would describe it
as controlled panic.

733
01:08:02,349 --> 01:08:04,143
What do they expect
you to do?

734
01:08:04,185 --> 01:08:07,020
Find whoever it is.
Deal with him.

735
01:08:07,063 --> 01:08:09,523
Buy him off, kill him,
whatever's necessary.

736
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:11,483
But meanwhile?

737
01:08:11,524 --> 01:08:12,775
(PHONE RINGING)

738
01:08:12,818 --> 01:08:15,446
Yes. Speaking.

739
01:08:18,156 --> 01:08:20,283
Oh, are they clear?

740
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:25,371
That bad, huh?

741
01:08:26,414 --> 01:08:28,666
When will the film be here?

742
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:34,673
Well, yes,
he's here now.
I'll tell him.

743
01:08:34,715 --> 01:08:39,220
I'll get back to you
as soon as I've seen
the film. Goodbye.

744
01:08:39,261 --> 01:08:43,474
They have the film on Florida
and they're shipping
a print out here right away.

745
01:08:43,515 --> 01:08:48,561
Cavanaugh tells me that
he and his staff have drawn
a complete blank.

746
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:52,065
They checked out
everything and everybody
in Station Three,

747
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:55,360
except Hoffman.
I want you to get on Hoffman.

748
01:08:55,401 --> 01:08:59,071
And push Cavanaugh
on that Ainsley lead.
That's the only one we've got.

749
01:08:59,114 --> 01:09:01,909
And we're not going to be
able to control this thing
very much longer.

750
01:09:01,950 --> 01:09:03,785
Yes, sir.

751
01:09:03,826 --> 01:09:07,914
Oh, that film is going to
arrive at Station Three
about 4:00.

752
01:09:07,956 --> 01:09:11,334
Get it here
as soon as it arrives.

753
01:09:11,376 --> 01:09:14,463
Get me this number,
will you, Ann?

754
01:09:14,505 --> 01:09:17,215
Now, you left
the research center
in Zurich

755
01:09:17,258 --> 01:09:20,093
after you accepted
your position here.
Is that correct?

756
01:09:20,135 --> 01:09:26,474
Yes. But as you know,
I went on a four-week
motor tour before I reported.

757
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:28,476
Reported to Washington?

758
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:32,398
Yes. Well, actually,
to the United States Counsel
at Naples

759
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:34,650
before I boarded the Da Vinci.

760
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:35,984
And that was in...

761
01:09:36,026 --> 01:09:39,988
That was five months ago.
The exact date was...

762
01:09:40,030 --> 01:09:41,990
Oh, I have it here.

763
01:09:43,116 --> 01:09:46,494
You were out of touch
while touring?

764
01:09:46,536 --> 01:09:51,291
I had no set plans.
I motored through the Tyrol,
across the Brenner,

765
01:09:51,333 --> 01:09:57,798
Lake Lugano.
Naturally, if I had been
needed here immediately...

766
01:09:57,839 --> 01:10:03,804
It was a... It was kind of
therapeutic irresponsibility.

767
01:10:03,845 --> 01:10:06,808
Lee, we just got
the last word on Ainsley.

768
01:10:06,849 --> 01:10:09,393
Looks like we're on target.

769
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:12,438
Excuse me.

770
01:10:14,565 --> 01:10:16,024
Mr. Barrett.

771
01:10:16,066 --> 01:10:17,484
Yes?

772
01:10:19,695 --> 01:10:25,325
That bulletin over the radio
about the trouble in Florida,
the...

773
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:27,869
It sounded as if...

774
01:10:27,910 --> 01:10:29,996
We think
it's the botulinus.

775
01:10:30,038 --> 01:10:34,710
My God.
Why, Mr. Barrett?

776
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,044
We don't know.

777
01:10:36,086 --> 01:10:39,046
But for what purpose?

778
01:10:39,089 --> 01:10:42,050
We're trying to
find that out. Excuse me.

779
01:10:44,595 --> 01:10:46,513
He's disappeared.

780
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:49,808
The Santa Barbara house
and the Phoenix place
have been closed for months.

781
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:52,560
He was last seen
in his New York place.

782
01:10:52,603 --> 01:10:55,146
How long ago was that?
Eight months.

783
01:10:55,188 --> 01:10:58,691
We ran everybody
who ever said hello to him
through the wringer.

784
01:10:58,734 --> 01:11:00,193
His ex-housekeeper
in New York

785
01:11:00,235 --> 01:11:03,571
said that he told her
he was going on a world tour.

786
01:11:03,614 --> 01:11:07,243
Somebody bought the tickets.
Travel agency must have
a schedule.

787
01:11:07,284 --> 01:11:11,998
She said Ainsley is
not the kind of man
you ask questions of.

788
01:11:12,039 --> 01:11:14,290
Well, what does he look like?
We have any pictures?

789
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,793
No.

790
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:18,170
There's no reason
for anybody to keep
a file on him.

791
01:11:18,211 --> 01:11:21,173
No pictures,
newspaper morgue,
no personal stuff?

792
01:11:21,214 --> 01:11:28,054
None. He's an eccentric.
No pictures, no relatives,
no public life.

793
01:11:28,096 --> 01:11:30,473
Visual description
from all concerned.

794
01:11:30,515 --> 01:11:36,021
Age, 50-something.
Height, medium. Hair, brown.
Coloring, normal.

795
01:11:36,063 --> 01:11:37,564
Distinguishing
characteristics, none.

796
01:11:37,605 --> 01:11:40,901
No other leads,
nothing?
No.

797
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:45,321
If anybody could beat
any haystacks any flatter
than we have.

798
01:11:45,363 --> 01:11:50,035
Lee, look. He's the only name
that's dropped into this
from the outside.

799
01:11:50,076 --> 01:11:52,870
And he's vanished
from the face of the earth.

800
01:11:52,913 --> 01:11:57,543
Everything we know about him
fits the man that
sent that telegram.

801
01:11:57,584 --> 01:12:02,214
Lunatic fringe, crank,
rich, with resources.

802
01:12:02,255 --> 01:12:04,800
Now, it's too much
to be a coincidence.

804
01:12:08,511 --> 01:12:10,513
Barrett here.

805
01:12:10,555 --> 01:12:13,058
Thank you.
The film is here.

806
01:12:18,939 --> 01:12:23,068
I thought something
had happened when
I didn't hear from you.

807
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,570
What?

808
01:12:27,864 --> 01:12:29,365
I see.

809
01:12:31,034 --> 01:12:33,411
Everything's perfect here.

810
01:12:36,623 --> 01:12:38,250
What?

811
01:12:41,003 --> 01:12:42,504
Where?

812
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:47,134
Where?

813
01:12:50,595 --> 01:12:52,305
Yes.

814
01:12:53,681 --> 01:12:55,308
Yes.

815
01:12:56,601 --> 01:12:57,978
Yes, we can.

816
01:13:58,955 --> 01:14:00,999
Well?

817
01:14:01,041 --> 01:14:02,625
No doubt about it.

818
01:14:13,804 --> 01:14:17,808
Williams here. Thank you.

819
01:14:20,853 --> 01:14:24,773
Hello, sir.
We're looking at
the film now.

820
01:14:24,815 --> 01:14:28,485
Michaelson said there's
no question about it.

821
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:35,491
Did they
tell them everything?

822
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:42,708
No, sir, I'm sorry,
I can't.

823
01:14:42,749 --> 01:14:44,291
Not a thing.

824
01:14:46,461 --> 01:14:49,171
I understand. Goodbye.

825
01:14:57,305 --> 01:15:00,475
Well, they've had to
give the press everything.

826
01:15:00,516 --> 01:15:02,978
Except the connection
with Station Three.

Yes.

Who is this?

01:15:27,085 --> 01:15:30,255
All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.

833
01:15:30,296 --> 01:15:33,716
You have seen
what I have done in Florida.

834
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:38,930
You have ignored my order.

835
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:43,644
Continue, and you will
sacrifice hundreds of
thousands of innocent lives.

Who is this?

Who is this?

838
01:15:48,856 --> 01:15:54,486
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

839
01:15:54,529 --> 01:15:56,573
Now listen,
don't hang up.

840
01:15:56,614 --> 01:15:58,950
I'll agree to meet you
anywhere you say.

841
01:15:58,991 --> 01:16:01,828
But you must realize
that we have to discuss...

843

CAVANAUGH:
Operator! Operator!

844
01:16:11,088 --> 01:16:14,841
A call just came through
on this phone, trace it.

845
01:16:14,883 --> 01:16:17,760
Why not?
This is vitally important.

846
01:16:17,803 --> 01:16:20,013
Well, why is it impossible?

847
01:16:23,725 --> 01:16:25,351
I see.

848
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:29,355
This number can be reached
by an area code number.

849
01:16:29,396 --> 01:16:31,649
That call could have
come from any place
in the country.

850
01:16:31,691 --> 01:16:35,236
It would take a week
to track it down, if then.

AINSLEY ON TAPE:
Don't interrupt.

852
01:16:44,495 --> 01:16:48,500
GENERAL: All right,
I'm listening. Go ahead.

853
01:16:48,541 --> 01:16:51,878
AINSLEY: You've seen
what I've done in Florida.

Noon tomorrow!

Who is this?

don't hang up.

I'll agree to meet you
anywhere you say.

CAVANAUGH: Operator! Operator!

01:17:35,338 --> 01:17:38,925
A call just came through
on this number, trace it.

866
01:17:45,765 --> 01:17:48,644
We have to get every man
in the country to find him.

867
01:17:48,685 --> 01:17:51,896
We're already doing that,
but it's too late,
he could be anywhere.

868
01:17:52,564 --> 01:17:56,484
And he has those flasks.

869
01:17:56,526 --> 01:18:00,238
Yes, I know that General,
and we can't evacuate
Los Angeles.

870
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:02,073
We don't have time.

871
01:18:02,114 --> 01:18:06,411
We'll have to try.
Meanwhile, we keep stalling
and hope for a break.

872
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:10,248
Sir.

873
01:18:12,543 --> 01:18:15,670
Don't you think
we should capitulate?

874
01:18:15,711 --> 01:18:19,424
Station Three
will only be the beginning.

875
01:18:19,465 --> 01:18:23,511
It's a bluff. It must be.
No one would do such a thing.

876
01:18:23,554 --> 01:18:26,098
Are you prepared
to take that chance?

877
01:18:26,139 --> 01:18:27,724
Bring the tape recorder
with you.

878
01:18:27,765 --> 01:18:31,144
There's no point in
continuing this charade
of hiding out here.

879
01:18:31,186 --> 01:18:34,189
Lee, I'd like to have you
check out...

880
01:18:35,356 --> 01:18:36,899
What is it?

881
01:18:38,025 --> 01:18:40,236
Why did he give his name?

882
01:18:40,278 --> 01:18:45,575
It doesn't make any sense.
It would have been better
to keep us guessing.

883
01:18:45,616 --> 01:18:48,410
I don't agree.
That's exactly what
a paranoid would do.

884
01:18:48,453 --> 01:18:51,956
You heard that voice.
A monstrous ego working.

885
01:18:51,998 --> 01:18:55,043
No, sir,
there's something wrong.

886
01:18:55,085 --> 01:18:57,420
GENERAL: What?

887
01:18:57,463 --> 01:19:01,883
I can't put my finger on it,
I don't really know.

888
01:19:01,924 --> 01:19:04,051
We'll be at Station Three.

889
01:19:26,574 --> 01:19:28,368
I checked out
the car for you, Lee.

890
01:19:28,409 --> 01:19:31,371
He got a flat
coming down the canyon.
Where?

891
01:19:31,413 --> 01:19:34,415
It was picked up
about a half mile
down the road.

892
01:19:34,456 --> 01:19:37,043
A couple hundred feet
above split rock.

893
01:19:37,084 --> 01:19:40,088
You remember, we caught
some trout there.

894
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:43,008
You can still see the marks
on the shoulder.

895
01:19:43,049 --> 01:19:44,800
See you.

896
01:19:51,099 --> 01:19:53,769
What's the significance
of the car, Lee?

897
01:19:53,810 --> 01:19:57,814
Nothing, just checking,
you check everything.

898
01:20:30,638 --> 01:20:33,891
Is that where
the car got the flat?

899
01:20:33,934 --> 01:20:37,729
Well, the car
slipped off the jack.

900
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:40,065
Obviously, he tried
to dig a hole to get it
back on and couldn't,

901
01:20:40,773 --> 01:20:42,693
so he abandoned it.

902
01:20:44,945 --> 01:20:46,654
Come on.

903
01:21:03,420 --> 01:21:08,009
All right, sit down here, Ann.
Now follow me on this.

904
01:21:09,426 --> 01:21:11,721
Everybody figures

905
01:21:11,763 --> 01:21:14,681
that whoever
took the bugs got out.

906
01:21:15,350 --> 01:21:17,728
They're gone.

907
01:21:17,769 --> 01:21:22,608
The inside assist,
Ostrer, he's dead.

908
01:21:24,441 --> 01:21:29,364
But let's suppose
that there's another man
that's tied up in all this,

909
01:21:29,405 --> 01:21:33,200
who's still here,
who can't get out.

910
01:21:33,243 --> 01:21:36,538
Why does he have to get out?
Why doesn't he just stay here?

911
01:21:36,579 --> 01:21:38,664
Because he's got
something vital.

912
01:21:38,706 --> 01:21:43,253
Something that Ainsley's
got to have, and he's
got to have in a hurry.

913
01:21:43,294 --> 01:21:44,963
I don't understand.

914
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:49,466
Two men got into E Lab.

915
01:21:49,509 --> 01:21:52,595
One got out as Baxter,
he walked out.

916
01:21:52,638 --> 01:21:54,930
The other one
through the fence
with the bugs.

917
01:21:54,973 --> 01:21:57,183
Let's say that they met
this third man,

918
01:21:57,224 --> 01:22:00,145
who took all the flasks,
except two,

919
01:22:00,186 --> 01:22:04,899
which he gave to them,
and then they took off,
probably in Baxter's car.

920
01:22:04,940 --> 01:22:08,653
One flask for Florida.
One for Los Angeles.

921
01:22:08,694 --> 01:22:10,571
I've got that.

922
01:22:10,613 --> 01:22:16,286
Now, let's say that
this third man takes off
with the rest of the flasks.

923
01:22:16,328 --> 01:22:19,039
But he's got one more thing
that he must do.

924
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:22,166
Knock off Ostrer,
who's a threat somehow.

925
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:24,669
Let's say
he knocks off Ostrer,

926
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:27,880
comes down this road,
free and clear.

927
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:30,550
And then the nightmare
of all criminals happens.

928
01:22:30,591 --> 01:22:33,135
The senseless accident.

929
01:22:35,388 --> 01:22:36,889
The flat.
Right!

930
01:22:36,931 --> 01:22:40,268
He tries to fix it,
the car slips off the jack.

931
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:43,855
Now he's stuck.
What would you do?

932
01:22:43,896 --> 01:22:45,773
I'd hitchhike down the road.

933
01:22:45,815 --> 01:22:47,316
But the bugs?

934
01:22:47,358 --> 01:22:49,235
You couldn't take a chance
on taking them with you

935
01:22:49,276 --> 01:22:51,195
and you wouldn't leave them
in the car.

936
01:22:51,236 --> 01:22:54,449
So, where would you put them
where they'd be safe?

937
01:22:54,490 --> 01:22:57,493
Where you could
get to them when you
were free to

938
01:22:57,535 --> 01:23:00,080
and where they'd stay cool.

939
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,419
The water.

940
01:23:06,461 --> 01:23:07,754
I'd hide them in the water.

941
01:23:07,795 --> 01:23:09,546
That's what I think.

942
01:23:38,118 --> 01:23:39,660
Lee!

943
01:24:40,638 --> 01:24:42,808
Whose car was that?

944
01:24:42,849 --> 01:24:44,934
Just stand.

945
01:24:46,351 --> 01:24:48,729
Perfectly still.

946
01:24:53,484 --> 01:24:55,445
Handle that gently.

947
01:25:00,283 --> 01:25:02,828
Those misses were intentional.

948
01:25:02,869 --> 01:25:05,580
Stand exactly
where you are, Ann.

949
01:25:17,466 --> 01:25:20,886
And that I presume
was Doctor Baxter?

950
01:25:20,928 --> 01:25:23,723
Just put the flask
back in the box.

951
01:27:10,455 --> 01:27:12,081
Sit down.

952
01:27:40,066 --> 01:27:42,863
There's a phone call for you
in the administration,
Mr. Cavanaugh.

953
01:27:42,904 --> 01:27:44,364
Thank you.

954
01:28:11,181 --> 01:28:13,309
Absolutely no sign of them.

955
01:28:13,350 --> 01:28:15,811
We checked out
Barrett's car.

956
01:28:15,853 --> 01:28:19,064
No sign of violence
there or anywhere.

957
01:28:19,106 --> 01:28:22,818
Just some footprints
down by the bank
of the stream. Nothing else.

958
01:28:22,860 --> 01:28:25,236
Have you heard
anything here?

959
01:28:25,279 --> 01:28:27,156
No.

960
01:28:27,198 --> 01:28:29,784
He hasn't been missing long.
He could be anywhere.

961
01:28:29,825 --> 01:28:31,619
You know what
he's like, sir.

962
01:28:31,661 --> 01:28:36,833
I don't understand why
Barrett is so interested
in Dr. Hoffman's car.

963
01:28:36,874 --> 01:28:38,668
I don't either, sir.

964
01:28:38,709 --> 01:28:40,545
The Highway Patrol
officer said...

965
01:28:40,586 --> 01:28:41,253
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

966
01:28:41,295 --> 01:28:43,214
Yes?

967
01:28:43,255 --> 01:28:45,883
MAN ON INTERCOM:
Mr. Cavanaugh?
Johnson's on the line.

968
01:28:45,925 --> 01:28:47,759
Put him on.
JOHNSON: Hello?

969
01:28:47,801 --> 01:28:50,345
Yes, Johnson.

970
01:28:50,388 --> 01:28:53,140
No sign of them
in any of the places
we've looked in town.

971
01:28:53,183 --> 01:28:56,143
Keep looking.
Yes, sir.

972
01:28:56,185 --> 01:29:02,024
The officer said that Barrett
just wanted to know where
the doctor had had the flat.

973
01:29:02,066 --> 01:29:06,946
Well, so what?
We knew about it.
You had a flat last night.

974
01:29:06,988 --> 01:29:11,784
You started to hitchhike,
they picked you up outside
of town and brought you here.

975
01:29:11,826 --> 01:29:13,535
I was very lucky.

976
01:29:13,578 --> 01:29:17,539
That road is lonely at night,
but I was picked up
in the canyon.

977
01:29:17,581 --> 01:29:19,209
Not outside of town.

978
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,876
Yes.

979
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:25,046
Barrett is liable to call us
anytime from anywhere.

980
01:29:25,089 --> 01:29:27,925
I think it means nothing.

981
01:29:27,968 --> 01:29:29,635
I've pulled
all the roadblocks.

982
01:29:29,676 --> 01:29:33,098
You want me to
put them back,
just in case?

983
01:29:33,139 --> 01:29:34,474
GENERAL: No point in that.

984
01:29:34,515 --> 01:29:35,558
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

985
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,768
GENERAL: Yes?

986
01:29:37,809 --> 01:29:39,686
MAN ON INTERCOM:
There's a call
for Dr. Hoffman.

987
01:29:39,729 --> 01:29:43,065
GENERAL:
Put it through. Doctor.

988
01:29:43,108 --> 01:29:45,901
DONALD: Doctor Hoffman?
Yes.

989
01:29:45,943 --> 01:29:48,738
Hello, Gregor,
this is Donald.

990
01:29:48,779 --> 01:29:54,660
Sorry to disturb you,
but we were going fishing
this afternoon, remember?

991
01:29:54,701 --> 01:29:57,788
Well, I... I couldn't,
I was tied up here.

992
01:29:57,829 --> 01:30:01,291
Sorry you missed out,
the fishing was good.

993
01:30:01,333 --> 01:30:06,046
Do you have to work tonight?
We're at your trailer.
How about dinner?

994
01:30:06,088 --> 01:30:09,966
(STUTTERING) Well, Donald,
I... I do not see how...

995
01:30:10,009 --> 01:30:15,973
I wish you could.
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

996
01:30:16,015 --> 01:30:17,933
Well, it would be
very nice, Donald...

997
01:30:17,975 --> 01:30:21,061
There's no need
for you to stay here now.

998
01:30:21,103 --> 01:30:24,481
Jeff, run the Doctor home.
All right, Eric.

999
01:30:24,524 --> 01:30:25,983
Thank you.

1000
01:30:26,025 --> 01:30:29,236
I will be there
in a few minutes, Donald.
Good.

1001
01:30:59,434 --> 01:31:01,936
Thank you.

1002
01:31:41,475 --> 01:31:43,935
DONALD: He stopped on
the road, slid down the bank,

1003
01:31:43,978 --> 01:31:47,898
and got to the flasks
before we did.

1004
01:31:47,939 --> 01:31:49,984
This is the only place
we had to hide 'em.

1005
01:31:50,025 --> 01:31:54,195
I know it was taking
a chance to call you.

1006
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:58,200
But I was afraid
you were caught.
He knew about your car.

1007
01:31:58,243 --> 01:32:02,746
Now we're stuck.
There are roadblocks
all over the place.

1008
01:32:04,540 --> 01:32:06,750
Everything's fine, Donald.

1009
01:32:06,791 --> 01:32:11,671
Nobody's suspicious,
and the roadblocks
have been removed.

1010
01:32:14,425 --> 01:32:19,054
It seems that Mr. Barrett
is so unpredictable

1011
01:32:19,095 --> 01:32:22,808
that nothing has been made
of their disappearance.

1012
01:32:25,435 --> 01:32:28,730
Did Los Angeles
go as planned, Veretti?

1013
01:32:28,773 --> 01:32:30,356
I put it there.

1014
01:32:41,451 --> 01:32:43,329
We will take them
with us.

1015
01:32:43,370 --> 01:32:45,121
That's dangerous.

1016
01:32:45,164 --> 01:32:47,999
If there is any trouble,
they will be our
best protection.

1017
01:32:59,804 --> 01:33:04,349
There's nothing happening yet.
They're still all
in the trailer.

1018
01:33:04,391 --> 01:33:07,311
GENERAL: What about
the manager?

1019
01:33:07,353 --> 01:33:09,354
Oh, we're keeping
the manager out of the way.

1020
01:33:09,396 --> 01:33:11,983
Do you think Barrett saw you?
Possibly.

1021
01:33:12,024 --> 01:33:14,944
But he'd never recognize me,
he's never seen me before.

1022
01:33:14,985 --> 01:33:16,778
Can you see anything
going on in there?

1023
01:33:16,820 --> 01:33:22,576
There's no movement,
no sound, no,
nothing happening.

1024
01:33:22,618 --> 01:33:24,244
Keep on the line.

1025
01:33:24,285 --> 01:33:26,455
MICHAELSON: Why would
Dr. Hoffman be
connected with this?

1026
01:33:26,496 --> 01:33:28,123
Why? I don't understand.

1027
01:33:28,165 --> 01:33:30,751
He checked out perfectly.
There's nothing
in his background

1028
01:33:30,793 --> 01:33:33,920
to indicate that he's...
Dr. Michaelson, please.

1029
01:33:33,963 --> 01:33:36,423
We've got to grab them, sir.
Right now.

1030
01:33:36,465 --> 01:33:39,093
Certainly not,
Cavanaugh.

1031
01:33:39,134 --> 01:33:43,680
Now, we know that Barrett
is in Dr. Hoffman's trailer
with two strange men.

1032
01:33:43,723 --> 01:33:48,435
And we know that Dr. Hoffman
is there and he's connected
with those men.

1033
01:33:48,478 --> 01:33:53,858
And we know Dr. Hoffman's car
had some special
significance to Barrett.

1034
01:33:53,899 --> 01:33:56,360
And that's all we know.

1035
01:33:56,401 --> 01:34:01,448
We don't even know
if Barrett went there
willingly or unwillingly.

1036
01:34:01,490 --> 01:34:04,243
Let me grab them, sir,
and I'll find out.

1037
01:34:04,284 --> 01:34:06,870
I don't think you'd find out
anything that would be worth

1038
01:34:06,911 --> 01:34:07,704
losing the only advantage
we have.

1039
01:34:07,746 --> 01:34:13,210
MICHAELSON: What is that?

1040
01:34:13,253 --> 01:34:17,339
They will lead us
to Ainsley, to the flasks.

1041
01:34:18,299 --> 01:34:21,468
Only the flasks
are important.

1042
01:34:21,510 --> 01:34:25,471
This is the break
we've been praying for.

1043
01:34:25,514 --> 01:34:29,644
They're going to leave.
We let them.

1044
01:34:29,685 --> 01:34:33,564
Then we shadow them,
very carefully.

1045
01:34:33,605 --> 01:34:38,569
Let one eager beaver
show our hand,
and we're through.

1046
01:34:38,610 --> 01:34:40,236
Now set it up.

1047
01:34:41,862 --> 01:34:46,243
In the desert we're okay,
not much traffic.

1048
01:34:46,285 --> 01:34:48,370
But we could lose them
in the first town.

1049
01:34:48,413 --> 01:34:50,039
And what if they head
for that mess that'll be

1050
01:34:50,080 --> 01:34:52,874
coming out of Los Angeles?
We'll change
our strategy by then.

1051
01:34:52,916 --> 01:34:55,001
At least we'll know
which way they're headed.

1052
01:34:55,044 --> 01:34:57,171
Set it up.
Yes, sir.

1053
01:35:12,603 --> 01:35:14,646
MAN ON RADIO:
The evacuation of
Los Angeles is under way.

1054
01:35:14,689 --> 01:35:17,149
(HELICOPTER FLYING)

1055
01:35:17,191 --> 01:35:24,198
It is too early to say yet
how effective this will be,
or how possible it will be.

1056
01:35:24,239 --> 01:35:28,243
There is no further
official word as to the exact
imminence of the threat.

1057
01:35:28,285 --> 01:35:32,081
It means nothing.
There are military training
fields all around here.

1058
01:35:32,123 --> 01:35:35,876
Incident in Florida
is related to this situation.

1059
01:35:35,918 --> 01:35:39,045
PILOT ON RADIO:
I'm staying above
and behind them.

1060
01:35:39,088 --> 01:35:42,716
They're still traveling west
on 17.

1061
01:35:42,758 --> 01:35:44,760
They seem to be stalling.

1062
01:35:44,801 --> 01:35:48,013
They're almost
going around in circles.

1063
01:35:48,054 --> 01:35:50,349
Why?

1064
01:35:50,390 --> 01:35:55,561
Evasive action.
They're taking the long way
to wherever they're going.

1065
01:36:05,114 --> 01:36:08,618
It's getting
a little difficult
to keep them in sight.

1066
01:36:08,659 --> 01:36:13,038
This is pretty rough country
and it's closing in
on the road.

1067
01:36:13,079 --> 01:36:15,374
I don't like this section
they're going through.

1068
01:36:15,415 --> 01:36:19,335
It's impossible to keep
visual contact without
the chopper tipping its hand.

1069
01:36:19,378 --> 01:36:24,049
There are only three points
they can come out of there,
here, here and here.

1070
01:36:24,090 --> 01:36:26,218
You have men covering
all of them, haven't you?

1071
01:36:26,260 --> 01:36:30,055
Yes, sir. I'll double up
here and here.

1072
01:36:30,096 --> 01:36:32,808
PILOT: I'm going to lose them
for a long stretch now.

1073
01:36:32,849 --> 01:36:34,851
Unless I close in.

1074
01:36:34,894 --> 01:36:37,271
Don't close up,
stay out of sight

1075
01:36:37,313 --> 01:36:40,274
until you can pick them up
on the other side
of the section.

1076
01:36:40,315 --> 01:36:41,441
PILOT: Will do.

1077
01:36:41,483 --> 01:36:44,986
Where's your follow car?

and it's announced
that Station Three
is being destroyed,

1180
01:52:48,866 --> 01:52:52,745
will you take me
to where the flask is
and immobilize it?

1181
01:52:55,624 --> 01:52:59,209
Perhaps you had better
get in the car, Mr. Barrett.

1182
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,302
On the other side.

1183
01:53:29,198 --> 01:53:30,866
I determined in
the laboratory

1184
01:53:30,909 --> 01:53:35,245
that only a four
and a half pound pressure
shatters this flask.

1185
01:53:37,456 --> 01:53:39,709
I can easily apply that.

1186
01:53:57,893 --> 01:54:00,438
I spotted
the station wagon again.

1187

They're still moving north
on Seco Road.

Any sign of
the follow car?

No.

1190
01:54:11,950 --> 01:54:17,080
It looks like there's
some kind of fire back there
where they came from.

A lot of orange flame

Ah, I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

1195
01:54:32,845 --> 01:54:36,181
Ainsley's been missing
for months and Hoffman's
been on the scene for months.

1196
01:54:36,224 --> 01:54:39,184
Or at least you're
an impersonation of
the real Hoffman.

1197
01:54:39,226 --> 01:54:41,020
What happened to him?

1198
01:54:43,898 --> 01:54:46,775
That's not hard to figure.
Gregor Hoffman,
living in Vienna,

1199
01:54:46,816 --> 01:54:48,194
hired by Baxter
from Austria.

1200
01:54:48,236 --> 01:54:52,115
Did you kill him
or did you have him killed?

1201
01:54:52,156 --> 01:54:55,284
You're no biochemist,
how did you fool them?

1202
01:54:55,325 --> 01:54:58,120
I am a biochemist,
Mr. Barrett, of sorts.

1203
01:54:58,161 --> 01:55:00,580
If you were more familiar
with the name Ainsley,

1204
01:55:00,623 --> 01:55:03,876
you'd know
I made my fortune
in patent medicines.

1205
01:55:03,918 --> 01:55:07,755
Sometimes a little bit of
knowledge goes a long way.

1206
01:55:07,796 --> 01:55:09,840
The accent? Easy.

1207
01:55:09,883 --> 01:55:12,260
I lived for years
in Austria.

1208
01:55:12,301 --> 01:55:15,429
Besides, Gregor Hoffman,
though he lived
an obscure life,

1209
01:55:15,470 --> 01:55:17,848
was a world famous chemist.

1210
01:55:17,890 --> 01:55:21,019
You don't ask
a famous chemist
the formula for salt.

1211
01:55:21,060 --> 01:55:23,646
But Ostrer did.
You had everyone fooled
but Ostrer.

1212
01:55:23,688 --> 01:55:27,441
He knew you weren't
the real Hoffman,
so he died, too.

1213
01:55:27,483 --> 01:55:30,110
That tone is
surprisingly juvenile,
Mr. Barrett.

1214
01:55:30,153 --> 01:55:33,112
I believe that
hundreds of people
might have died in Florida.

1215
01:55:33,155 --> 01:55:36,366
This afternoon when
I was interrogating you,
you heard Cavanaugh say that.

1216
01:55:36,409 --> 01:55:39,203
Ainsley was our man.
Then you knew what to do.

1217
01:55:39,244 --> 01:55:41,039
Somehow you made
two telephone calls.

1218
01:55:41,080 --> 01:55:43,624
One to your boys
to pick up the flasks
where you had to leave them

1219
01:55:43,666 --> 01:55:45,209
in the stream
and the other
to the General.

1220
01:55:45,250 --> 01:55:48,086
So you could give us
your ultimatum on Los Angeles.

1221
01:55:48,128 --> 01:55:50,840
Use the name C.R. Ainsley
so he would drop
the road blocks

1222
01:55:50,881 --> 01:55:53,718
and you could get out,
and he fell for it.

1223
01:55:53,759 --> 01:55:55,302
That's correct.

1224
01:55:55,344 --> 01:55:57,721
I didn't make
the telephone calls
somehow, Mr. Barrett.

1225
01:55:57,763 --> 01:55:59,933
I made them from
Station Three.

1229
01:56:18,576 --> 01:56:21,120
You're lucky
but you're mortal.
We all are.

1230
01:56:27,751 --> 01:56:33,215
MAN ON RADIO:
Tank vehicles carrying
liquids, assembly point B.

1231
01:56:33,256 --> 01:56:37,302
Ambulance section
re-designated, C.

1232
01:56:37,345 --> 01:56:43,141
Repeat, ambulance section
re-designated, C.

1233
01:56:43,183 --> 01:56:47,938
Control requests
the following be read
at five minute intervals.

1234
01:56:47,980 --> 01:56:52,318
An unidentified
scientific research
installation

1235
01:56:52,360 --> 01:56:56,155
based in Southern California
has ceased operation.

1236
01:56:56,196 --> 01:57:01,160
It will be dismantled
and cease to exist.
End announcement.

1237
01:57:18,344 --> 01:57:20,138
There he is.

1238
01:57:20,179 --> 01:57:21,930
Who's that with him?

1239
01:57:21,971 --> 01:57:23,933
I don't know.

1240
01:57:48,081 --> 01:57:50,876
You're under arrest,
Doctor Hoffman.

1241
01:57:52,628 --> 01:57:54,839
You're Lee Barrett,
aren't you?
That's right.

1242
01:57:54,880 --> 01:57:56,631
What are you
doing here, Barrett?

1243
01:57:56,674 --> 01:57:58,759
That's a long story.

1244
01:57:59,969 --> 01:58:02,555
Get out of the car, Doctor.

1245
01:58:02,596 --> 01:58:06,766
BARRETT: Be careful,
he's got a flask
in his pocket.

1246
01:58:14,316 --> 01:58:16,776
All right,
hand it over, Doctor.

1247
01:58:18,737 --> 01:58:20,364
Right now.

1248
01:58:22,658 --> 01:58:24,828
The end of the line?

1249
01:58:38,716 --> 01:58:41,426
All right,
get into the car, Doctor.

1250
01:58:43,929 --> 01:58:46,640
Better come along
with us, Barrett.

1251
01:58:50,353 --> 01:58:52,145
How did you get here?

1252
01:58:52,188 --> 01:58:53,523
We're spread
all over the place.

1253
01:58:53,564 --> 01:58:55,733
This is one of
50 we're covering.

1254
01:58:55,774 --> 01:58:57,693
What about the girl
and the two other guys?

1255
01:58:57,735 --> 01:58:59,862
I don't know.
Where's Cavanaugh?

1256
01:58:59,904 --> 01:59:02,490
They could be anywhere.
Our orders were
to pick up Hoffman,

1257
01:59:02,531 --> 01:59:04,158
stay off the radio,
and don't say a word

1258
01:59:04,199 --> 01:59:06,826
until we get him
to Station Three.

1259
01:59:20,299 --> 01:59:23,969
(WHISPERING) Have you
got enough sense to
keep your mouth shut?

1260
01:59:24,011 --> 01:59:25,263
Yes.

1261
01:59:27,515 --> 01:59:31,310
We've got
a jack-knifed truck up here.
You can turn your engine off.

1262
01:59:31,351 --> 01:59:36,190
It won't be long.
The tow truck will have it
out of here in a few minutes.

1263
01:59:36,231 --> 01:59:37,983
Anybody hurt?

1264
01:59:38,025 --> 01:59:40,069
No, he was lucky.

1265
01:59:51,955 --> 01:59:55,168
We got a jack-knifed truck,
it won't be long.

1266
02:00:11,934 --> 02:00:16,439
Won't be long he says.
Did you ever hear
a cop say anything else?

1267
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,481
It'll be hours.

1268
02:00:18,524 --> 02:00:23,278
By that time, that mess
from L.A. will hit us
and we'll never move.

1269
02:00:25,030 --> 02:00:28,909
Look at all those cans
and busted beer bottles.

1270
02:00:28,951 --> 02:00:33,664
You'd think
people wouldn't throw
things out there like that.

1271
02:00:33,706 --> 02:00:35,540
You got a match?

1272
02:00:35,582 --> 02:00:37,960
Would you look at the jerk
handling that tow truck?

1273
02:00:38,001 --> 02:00:41,255
He's worse than the man
that was driving the rig.

1274
02:00:41,296 --> 02:00:43,131
Oh, boy,
that's all we need.

1275
02:00:43,173 --> 02:00:45,343
A sidewalk superintendent.

1276
02:00:46,594 --> 02:00:48,888
Wise guy, huh?

1277
02:01:20,169 --> 02:01:22,004
There's your daughter,
but what's happened
to Barrett?

1278
02:01:22,045 --> 02:01:24,006
Where's Hoffman?

1279
02:01:26,425 --> 02:01:29,845
Dad! Dad!

1280
02:01:29,888 --> 02:01:33,181
Dad, Lee's dead.
They threw a flask,

1281
02:01:33,223 --> 02:01:35,100
they threw a flask
back at the gas station.

1282
02:01:35,143 --> 02:01:37,144
What happened to Barrett,
where is he?

1283
02:01:37,185 --> 02:01:39,229
You've got to
go clear out the area.
He's at the station.

1284
02:01:39,271 --> 02:01:42,400
Don't you understand?
That man Veretti,
he threw a flask.

1285
02:01:42,441 --> 02:01:43,984
Sir.

1286
02:01:49,031 --> 02:01:50,115
Where is the Satan Bug?

1287
02:01:50,158 --> 02:01:51,825
Hoffman took it.
He changed cars

1288
02:01:51,866 --> 02:01:54,036
and he went back
the way we came from.
What kind of car was it?

1289
02:01:54,078 --> 02:01:56,414
It was a green Ford sedan.

1290
02:01:56,455 --> 02:01:58,206
License?
Oh, I don't know,

1291
02:01:58,248 --> 02:02:02,503
I couldn't see it
very clearly. It was
FGA, something, 7, I think.

1292
02:02:02,545 --> 02:02:05,089
Put it on the radio.
Hey, give me that stuff.

1293
02:02:05,130 --> 02:02:07,215
Dad, you've got to go back
and clear out that area.

1294
02:02:07,256 --> 02:02:09,801
That's all right, dear,
that's all right.

1295
02:02:09,843 --> 02:02:11,179
The flask is harmless now.

1296
02:02:11,220 --> 02:02:14,890
The station burned.
There's nothing
to worry about.

1297
02:02:14,933 --> 02:02:18,185
We found the bodies
of Cavanaugh's men,
but not Lee's.

1298
02:02:18,226 --> 02:02:20,104
But Lee was in the building.
He was in the building.

1299
02:02:20,145 --> 02:02:25,900
Well, he's not there now.
Ann, Los Angeles,

1300
02:02:25,943 --> 02:02:29,989
did anyone say anything
about Los Angeles? Anything?

1301
02:02:30,030 --> 02:02:31,699
No. Nothing.

1302
02:02:31,740 --> 02:02:34,451
Put everything you've got
on Hoffman's car.

1303
02:02:34,493 --> 02:02:36,579
Yes, sir.
We're already on it.

1304
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:39,164
But there are an awful lot of
green Fords around.

1305
02:02:39,206 --> 02:02:43,210
And there's nothing
on these guys
except this stuff.

1306
02:02:43,251 --> 02:02:48,298
Guns, money, watches,
phony drivers license

1307
02:02:49,674 --> 02:02:52,010
and keys.

1308
02:02:52,051 --> 02:02:55,680
Maybe one of the keys
fits something in Los Angeles.

1309
02:02:55,723 --> 02:02:58,266
But how the hell
do we check that?

1310
02:03:43,896 --> 02:03:46,815
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

1311
02:03:46,856 --> 02:03:49,276
Sounds like the ignition.

1312
02:04:18,555 --> 02:04:20,933
Take a look
at that fuel pump.

1313
02:04:40,785 --> 02:04:43,621
You didn't really think
that I'd fall for
those goons of yours

1314
02:04:43,663 --> 02:04:46,375
posing as Cavanaugh's men,
did you?

1315
02:04:57,636 --> 02:05:00,514
Okay, I've got the gun now.

1316
02:05:00,555 --> 02:05:04,309
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1317
02:05:04,351 --> 02:05:07,145
before that copter of yours
settles down.

1318
02:05:07,186 --> 02:05:09,439
You haven't given me
any reason why
I won't smash this.

1319
02:05:10,149 --> 02:05:15,404
This is the end of the line,
Ainsley.

1320
02:05:15,445 --> 02:05:17,364
For real now.

1321
02:05:17,405 --> 02:05:19,491
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1322
02:05:19,533 --> 02:05:21,910
or I'll blow
a hole in your head!

1323
02:05:26,581 --> 02:05:31,003
You're psychotic,
but don't be stupid.

1324
02:05:31,044 --> 02:05:34,839
If I blow a hole
in your head or you
drop that bottle,

1325
02:05:34,881 --> 02:05:38,426
you'll die,
then you'll have nothing.

1326
02:05:38,468 --> 02:05:42,389
Perhaps I am psychotic,
but I'm certainly not stupid.

1327
02:05:42,430 --> 02:05:46,726
If I smash this,
I wouldn't die, Mr. Barrett.

1328
02:05:49,271 --> 02:05:50,730
Why do you think
Baxter waited so long

1329
02:05:50,772 --> 02:05:53,691
before telling anyone
about the Satan Bug.

1330
02:05:53,733 --> 02:05:56,028
Why do you think
he was working nights?
Weekends?

1331
02:05:56,069 --> 02:05:57,696
The vaccine!

1332
02:05:59,239 --> 02:06:02,116
Well, I waited for
the vaccine.

1333
02:06:02,159 --> 02:06:06,079
Two days ago he made it,
that's why he had
to die and Ostrer.

1334
02:06:06,120 --> 02:06:08,706
You were wrong
about him, too.

1335
02:06:08,748 --> 02:06:10,918
He didn't suspect me.
He didn't suspect anyone.

1336
02:06:10,959 --> 02:06:13,086
He just knew
about the vaccine

1337
02:06:13,128 --> 02:06:16,381
and now I'm the only one
who has the formula.

1338
02:06:16,424 --> 02:06:19,009
And the vaccine is
in my bloodstream.

1339
02:06:19,051 --> 02:06:21,470
I'm immune!
I won't die, I'm immune!

1340
02:06:22,179 --> 02:06:26,308
But you told us
what the Satan Bug would do.

1341
02:06:26,349 --> 02:06:32,064
You mean to say that you'd
live on this world alone?
By yourself?

1342
02:06:32,105 --> 02:06:35,818
I told you about
the Satan Bug to keep you
from finding Baxter.

1343
02:06:35,859 --> 02:06:38,570
Even so,
he believed every word I said.

1344
02:06:38,611 --> 02:06:43,075
But I'm not sure
how good a biochemist he was.

1345
02:06:43,116 --> 02:06:46,160
Some scientists thought
that the H-bomb would
start a chain reaction

1346
02:06:46,203 --> 02:06:50,790
that would blow up the world,
but it didn't.

1347
02:06:50,832 --> 02:06:53,543
Now, nobody really knows
about this.

1348
02:06:53,585 --> 02:06:56,213
Theoretically, yes.

1349
02:06:56,254 --> 02:07:00,634
But it hasn't yet
been put to the real test.

1350
02:07:00,675 --> 02:07:04,596
Perhaps it will
destroy all life.

1351
02:07:04,638 --> 02:07:06,515
Perhaps.

1352
02:07:06,556 --> 02:07:09,226
Certainly it could
destroy millions.

1353
02:07:11,228 --> 02:07:13,605
Do you want to test it?

1354
02:07:34,084 --> 02:07:35,960
Mr. Ainsley?
Yes.

1355
02:07:40,465 --> 02:07:42,634
I was watching for you
and saw the car stop.

1356
02:07:42,675 --> 02:07:45,136
Thought I'd better
pick you up here.

1357
02:07:45,177 --> 02:07:49,933
The engine failed.
Don't worry about it,
we'll take off immediately.

1358
02:07:49,974 --> 02:07:51,726
Yes, sir.

1359
02:07:53,061 --> 02:07:55,814
Any trouble, Mr. Ainsley?
No, no.

1360
02:08:04,073 --> 02:08:05,073
Well, Mr. Barrett?

1361
02:08:05,114 --> 02:08:07,826
The flask is still in
Los Angeles.

1362
02:09:14,184 --> 02:09:17,104
Still nothing?
I'm afraid not, sir.

1363
02:09:17,145 --> 02:09:19,356
Nothing on Los Angeles,
nothing at all?

1364
02:09:19,397 --> 02:09:20,858
Nothing of any consequence.

1365
02:09:20,899 --> 02:09:22,818
(PHONE RINGING)

1366
02:09:22,860 --> 02:09:24,361
Hello.

1367
02:09:24,403 --> 02:09:26,614
Only two tie-ups
to Los Angeles.

1368
02:09:26,655 --> 02:09:29,283
One of them is
an office building, here.
Where?

1369
02:09:29,324 --> 02:09:32,035
Ten stories high,
we've got men
going through them.

1370
02:09:32,076 --> 02:09:33,745
Starting from the top.

1371
02:09:33,786 --> 02:09:38,416
Now, the only other thing
is this little notation
in red ink.

1372
02:09:38,457 --> 02:09:40,460
Glendale 73.

1373
02:09:40,503 --> 02:09:43,213
We've got men calling
on every house with 73,

1374
02:09:43,255 --> 02:09:45,633
every phone number
beginning with 73,

1375
02:09:45,674 --> 02:09:48,551
every cab, well,
you get the idea, sir.

1376
02:09:48,593 --> 02:09:50,888
Yes.

1377
02:09:50,929 --> 02:09:55,308
Veretti did that,
he was doodling while
they were waiting for Hoffman.

1378
02:09:55,350 --> 02:09:57,644
Hold on, Jack,
take this.

1379
02:09:59,146 --> 02:10:01,314
Well, they found
the green car.

1380
02:10:01,355 --> 02:10:04,234
Where?
It was abandoned
in front of a restaurant

1381
02:10:04,276 --> 02:10:07,111
next to a service station
near Palmdale.

1382
02:10:07,154 --> 02:10:08,571
They were both closed,

1383
02:10:08,613 --> 02:10:10,865
but a watchman in
a gravel yard
across the street

1384
02:10:10,908 --> 02:10:14,578
saw the green car park
and two men get out.

1385
02:10:14,619 --> 02:10:17,580
He described
Hoffman perfectly.

1386
02:10:17,621 --> 02:10:18,331
And the other man?

1387
02:10:18,373 --> 02:10:21,375
It sounds like Barrett.

1388
02:10:21,418 --> 02:10:23,253
Well, what happened to them?

1389
02:10:23,295 --> 02:10:26,214
There were two other men
waiting in a black car.

1390
02:10:26,255 --> 02:10:28,300
They held guns
on the first two.

1391
02:10:28,341 --> 02:10:31,552
Then they got in the black car
and all four drove off.

1392
02:10:31,594 --> 02:10:33,596
Didn't the night watchman
try to stop them?

1393
02:10:33,638 --> 02:10:35,139
No.

1394
02:10:35,890 --> 02:10:37,766
God!

1395
02:10:37,809 --> 02:10:40,563
There's something else.

1396
02:10:40,604 --> 02:10:43,356
The watchman said
one of the men was
carrying something

1397
02:10:43,397 --> 02:10:46,068
that looked like
a small flask.

1398
02:10:48,778 --> 02:10:51,530
No license plate
on the black car?

1399
02:10:51,573 --> 02:10:53,866
Wrong angle,
couldn't see it.

Eric.

1402
02:11:13,511 --> 02:11:17,431
This was doodled
by that maniac, Veretti.
Look at this.

1403
02:11:19,643 --> 02:11:20,143
That could be a flask.

1404
02:11:20,184 --> 02:11:22,604
It is a flask.

1405
02:11:24,981 --> 02:11:27,775
I think all these
are flasks.

1406
02:11:28,485 --> 02:11:31,238
That is something real.

1407
02:11:31,279 --> 02:11:35,618
He's unconsciously
trying to draw
or doodle something.

1408
02:11:35,659 --> 02:11:40,329
What is it?

1409
02:11:40,371 --> 02:11:45,251
Those lines look like
parking dividers
on a parking lot.

1410
02:11:47,295 --> 02:11:49,339
Sir, look at this.

A baseball stadium?

02:12:10,694 --> 02:12:12,529
Jack, give me that.

Put me on Los Angeles 47
right away.

Nobody can.

Yes, we're here looking.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

You don't have
any intentions of going
where the flask is, do you?

1458
02:18:31,199 --> 02:18:34,243
As much as you have
of destroying
Station Three.

1459

That's not very clear
thinking, Ainsley.

If you intend to
take Los Angeles,
I'll take you,

get on the mike

And then?

Then, for the first time
in the world...

What are your plans
for the world, Ainsley?

It doesn't make
any difference
what you choose,

What was that
you said about Hoffman?

1490
02:21:49,230 --> 02:21:50,814
He jumped!

1491
02:21:50,856 --> 02:21:53,693
Oh, and tell Cavanaugh
to stop looking for Ainsley.

1492
02:21:53,735 --> 02:21:57,614
Ainsley and Hoffman
were the same man.

1493
02:21:57,655 --> 02:22:00,949
I'll be setting down at LAX.
Tell the boys to be
on the lookout for me.

1494
02:22:00,991 --> 02:22:04,120
I'm a little rusty
at these things.

1495
02:22:04,161 --> 02:22:07,164
We'll meet you there, Lee.
Take it nice and easy

1496
02:22:07,205 --> 02:22:10,543
and for God's sake
make a good landing.

1497
02:22:10,584 --> 02:22:16,090
I'll put down safely
and I'll give you the flask.

1498
02:22:16,133 --> 02:22:18,341
And then we're right back
where we started.
