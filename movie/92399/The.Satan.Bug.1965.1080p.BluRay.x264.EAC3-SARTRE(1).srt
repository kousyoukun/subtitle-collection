1
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,654
Thanks. I'll see ya.
Yes, sir.

2
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,631
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Raskin.

3
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,566
I see you've got
the duty again.

4
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,202
You've been back there a week.
It comes around.

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,804
Thanks.

6
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,886
Good night,
Dr. Ostrer.

7
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,154
Good night,
Reagan.

8
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,623
Oh, Reagan.

9
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,397
Reagan, I've gotta
talk to you.

10
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,932
I've got a minute now.

11
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,701
No. But I want to see you
tomorrow morning.

12
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,171
I'll come by your house.
10:00?

13
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,540
Fine.

14
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,749
What's this?
Laboratory equipment replacements.

15
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,250
Well, what happened
while I was gone?

16
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,818
Nothing, sir.

17
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,455
The Director?

18
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,590
Well, you know Dr. Baxter,
he's still...

19
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,525
Introverted.

20
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,760
Yes, sir.

21
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,329
Who's left in E Lab?

22
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,699
There's six, Dr. Baxter, Hoffman,
Yang, and three technicians.

23
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,267
Correct.

24
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,603
Gonna get these inside?
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,282
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mason.

26
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,717
Who's left in there?

27
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,388
Six, sir.
Dr. Baxter, Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Yang, and three technicians.

28
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,710
Dr. Hoffman.

29
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,311
Good evening, Reagan.

30
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,580
Is the Director in there?
Yes.

31
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:33,783
Working late tonight?

32
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:35,318
No.

33
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,868
Well, how was it
on the Potomac?

34
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:56,473
Not quiet.

35
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,176
I...
I understand the man has given us a new administrator,

36
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,679
Dr. Leonard Michaelson?

37
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:05,048
Who told you that?

38
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,818
Dr. Hoffman.

39
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,790
The cleaning woman told him.

40
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,092
Not funny.

41
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,394
Well, it's Friday.

42
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,464
Good night, Reagan.
See you Monday.

43
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,831
Good night, Doctor.

44
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:35,745
Any trouble? No, sir.
Just some minor residuals.

45
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,814
There's a couple of crates outside.
Let's get 'em in.

46
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:40,083
Yes, sir.
Raskin just called.

47
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:00,904
Good evening, Doctor.

48
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,506
Oh.

49
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:04,974
What is it, Reagan?

50
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:08,512
Working late?

51
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:11,815
No. But I'll be
in tomorrow.

52
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,683
What time?
8:00.

53
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,186
I'll set the time lock
for you.

54
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,523
Last time you locked
yourself out until Monday.

55
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:20,824
I know.

56
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,860
You've been away,
haven't you?

57
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,328
Washington.

58
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,098
How worried are they?

59
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:32,769
Well,
they're always worried about the security of this place.

60
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,604
My job's like that.

61
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,174
What they're really
worried about is that.

62
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,876
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,113
Did you, uh,
reassure them?

64
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,616
No. I leave that to you.

65
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,317
Yes.

66
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:54,423
Sir, do you think...

67
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:57,794
Why don't you take this Saturday and Sunday off,
Doctor?

68
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,395
Do you good.

69
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,998
No time for that, Reagan.

70
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,933
No time.

71
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,938
Tired men
make mistakes, Doctor.

72
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:12,208
God help us
if a mistake's made here.

73
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,782
Goodnight, Doctor.

74
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:24,353
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

75
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,590
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

76
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,401
Good night, Mason.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.

77
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:03,126
Good night,
Dr. Hoffman.

78
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,807
You are leaving, Doctor?

79
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,143
I'll be a few minutes.

80
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,948
Do you need me
for anything?

81
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,182
No.

82
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,752
Good night, Hoffman.

83
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,767
Goodnight, Dr. Hoffman.
Goodnight, Mason.

84
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,789
Good night, Doctor.

85
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,995
Good night, Doctor.

86
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,344
Mason speaking.

87
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:37,947
Is Doctor Williams in?

88
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,216
Dr. Williams
is not in E Lab.

89
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,719
Good night,
Dr. Baxter.

90
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:46,756
Two sixteen.
That's administration.

91
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,792
You're welcome.

92
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,280
It's Mason.
E Lab clear and closed.

93
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,216
Right.

94
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,828
Good night,
Doctor Baxter.

95
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,468
Good night, Doctor.

96
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,059
Raskin.

97
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,161
Yes, sir.

98
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,563
Reagan.
I'm going into E Lab.

99
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:20,176
The shoulder on
that back road's caved in.

100
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,946
We ought to take care of that tomorrow.
All right.

101
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:25,648
Might as well make a note of it in the
log for Mr. Reagan in the morning.

102
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:27,416
I'll tell him
when he leaves.

103
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,386
He's still here?
Mmm-hmm. E Lab.

104
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,690
What time
did he go in there?

105
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,267
Mr. Reagan.

106
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:48,972
Mr. Reagan.

107
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,577
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

108
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,914
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

109
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,124
Get over there and check
that security door.

110
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:19,868
This is Lieutenant Raskin,
Duty Officer, Station Three.

111
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:24,407
Get me the Director, Dr. Baxter, at home, or Mr. Tasserly.
Right.

112
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:50,566
There's a phone call for you.
What?

113
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,867
There's a phone call for you.

114
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,536
Thank you, very much.

115
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,721
Hello. Who?

116
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:19,062
Okay, put him on.
Yes. Mr. Martin?

117
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,997
Well, I could, but I don't
particularly want to.

118
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:26,269
Yeah. All right.
I hope it's as vital to me.

119
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,076
Mr. Martin?
Yes.

120
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,413
Good evening.

121
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,648
Good of you to see me at such a late hour,
Mr. Barrett.

122
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:15,484
You didn't care for a drink?
Oh, no, thank you.

123
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:18,487
Do you live aboard
all the time, Mr. Barrett?

124
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,189
No, just some of the time.

125
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:24,493
I don't imagine your law practice
is too demanding these days.

126
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,529
Could be better.

127
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,898
Yet, you can afford this yacht.
Must be rather expensive.

128
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,902
What can I do for you,
Mr. Martin?

129
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,973
We have a job for you.
We think you're the right man.

130
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,209
Oh? Why?

131
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,378
You have the background
for it.

132
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:46,915
And in the past,
you've been quite outspoken on the immorality of war.

133
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,984
Everybody says
he's against war.

134
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:52,955
Not ex-United States
Intelligence Officers.

135
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,958
Let's take a look
at some of the record.

136
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,695
"Lee Barrett. 1950.
University student. Pre law."

137
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:01,597
"Then active service,
Korea and helicopters."

138
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,300
"Detached for special service.
Excellent war record."

139
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,070
"Citation.
Superb lone operator who has no master in cunning,"

140
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,805
"secrecy or violence."

141
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,709
"Promoted to captain.
Recommended for three decorations."

142
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,711
First discordant note.
Last two refused.

143
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,582
You are quoted
as saying that war

144
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:23,586
"had aged you so fast,
you were too old to play with toys."

145
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,390
Rather a whimsical statement,
Mr. Barrett.

146
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:29,091
You think so?

147
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,294
Why did you
leave the service?

148
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,728
Poor prospects.

149
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:37,500
Discharged, 1952.

150
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:42,271
Allowed to resign commission after
altercation with a Major General.

151
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,440
Some people
have flat feet.

152
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:47,876
I dislike taking orders
under certain circumstances.

153
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:54,317
Then you got your law degree.
Passed the bar examination, but didn't practice.

154
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,652
Joined a government agency.

155
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,321
Fired.

156
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:02,358
A stint with another one.
Fired for the usual reason.

157
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,960
You rate rather high
on insubordination.

158
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,996
My record is easy to check,
Mr. Martin. Make your point.

159
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:13,068
A year ago you were appointed
Security Chief at Station Three.

160
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,371
How do you know
about Station Three?

161
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,141
The most secret chemical warfare
establishment in this hemisphere.

162
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,978
Fired three months ago.

163
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:28,116
Reason? "Emotional rejection
of purpose of project."

164
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,921
"Council for World Peace."

165
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,957
"Henry Martin,
Executive Secretary."

166
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,191
You heard of us?

167
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,526
Oh, yes.

168
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,528
But you don't approve of us?

169
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:42,064
I don't like semi-secret organizations,
Mr. Martin.

170
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,966
Neither do I,
Mr. Barrett.

171
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,135
But the Council is
a potent weapon for peace.

172
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:50,673
We're not communistic
or anti-communistic.

173
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,876
You just want
a workable peace.

174
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,679
Like you, perhaps,
Mr. Barrett.

175
00:19:56,712 --> 00:20:00,616
You have been outspoken
on the foolishness of war.

176
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:06,789
That was removed from Station
Three a few hours ago.

177
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,658
It doesn't matter
how at the moment.

178
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,860
Do you know
what it is?

179
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,299
Botulinus?

180
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,066
No.

181
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,803
A vaccine
against botulinus.

182
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:26,208
The contents of that flask can be
cultured to provide enough vaccine

183
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:28,477
to immunize
any nation on Earth.

184
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,448
We want it delivered
to this address.

185
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,554
Europe?
Yes.

186
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:41,023
How does that help peace?

187
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:44,393
It neutralizes
a terrible weapon.

188
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:48,764
If we both have it, well,
neither side can threaten the other with it.

189
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,935
Very dangerous assignment,
Mr. Martin.

190
00:20:55,404 --> 00:21:00,108
$10,000 should cover
your expenses.

191
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:03,579
I'm afraid not.

192
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:04,947
Then you refuse?

193
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,482
No.

194
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:12,287
It'll cost you 20,000.
10,000 each way. Cash. Now.

195
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,390
You mind if I say something,
Mr. Barrett?

196
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:15,891
Yes, I do.

197
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,192
Keep your speeches and
moralities for your council.

198
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:18,361
This is a business deal.

199
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:21,364
No wonder you were thrown
out of so many places.

200
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,166
Satisfied?

201
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,334
Yes.

202
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:29,338
Put your forearms
on the table.

203
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,107
You have a strange way of doing business,
Mr. Barrett.

204
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,742
What is this?
A holdup?

205
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,844
Put your forearms
on the table.

206
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,815
First,
vaccines are not stored at Station Three.

207
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,150
So this has got to be
some kind of a virus.

208
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:45,187
Second,
no one's supposed to know anything about Station Three.

209
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,124
And third,
I know quite a bit about the World Peace Organization.

210
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:52,695
There's a fat, balding man who is the secretary,
name, Henry Martin.

211
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,397
I know him.

212
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,198
What do you
intend to do?

213
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,867
Turn you over
to the right people.

214
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:02,037
I know this isn't evidence,

215
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,308
but with your fingerprints on the flask,
and the money, it'll do.

216
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:07,910
I guess
I underestimated you.

217
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:09,678
I guess you did.
Now, stand up.

218
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:12,981
Turn around, put your hands on
the bulkhead and lean on them.

219
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,741
Cavanaugh? What the hell
are you doing here?

220
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,776
Now, don't get sore, Barrett.
I had to do this in a hurry,

221
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,177
and it's the only way
I could handle it.

222
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,178
Handle what?

223
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,981
I had to check you
for security and quick.

224
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,486
That character's one of your agents?
That's right.

225
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,955
And you planned this whole thing
just to see if I could be bought?

226
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:54,957
You could put it
that way, I guess.

227
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,092
I didn't know what kind of
a security risk you'd become.

228
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,627
People change, you know.

229
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:02,097
You did have me worried on
that radio there for a moment.

230
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,232
Get out of here and get your
tail back to Washington.

231
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,868
Mr. Barrett,
I'm Dr. Leonard Michaelson.

232
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,103
I know who you are.
You, too. Get out.

233
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,673
Get your props
and get off this boat.

234
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:13,509
Barrett, you know the way
our security agency works.

235
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,878
Mr. Barrett, I can understand
how you might interpret this

236
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,213
as a reflection on your loyalty...
Sir.

237
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:21,183
Barrett, the General has asked
that we come to you.

238
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:24,453
He wants you
in on this.

239
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,189
In on what?

240
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:30,325
Station Three was broken into
a few hours ago.

241
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:33,596
Reagan's been murdered
and Dr. Baxter has vanished.

242
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,588
Mr. Michaelson?
Right.

243
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:02,357
I'm Pelton Tasserly, Deputy Administrator here.
Mr. Tasserly.

244
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,059
Lieutenant Raskin.
Lieutenant Johnson.

245
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,928
Good morning.
I'm very sorry about this, sir.

246
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,295
No sooner take over and...
Yes, yes, Tasserly.

247
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,431
You know Mr. Cavanaugh?
Yes, I do.

248
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:12,167
Mr. Barrett?
Hello, Barrett.

249
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,435
Anything on Baxter?

250
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,738
Nothing. But the net's out.
All points.

251
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,005
What steps have you taken?

252
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,841
None, really. I figured
you'd get here pretty fast.

253
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,043
So I've touched nothing,
talked to no one.

254
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,679
I did bring in all the security
people who were on duty last night.

255
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,114
Whom have you told about this,
Mr. Tasserly?

256
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:28,016
Well, no one,
other than you people,

257
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,484
and our security men,
of course.

258
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,987
And Doctor Hoffman.
Why him?

259
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,089
Well, he was the last one out,
except for the Director.

260
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,958
He's waiting
in E block now.

261
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,860
Let's take
a look at Reagan.

262
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:48,403
Are you with us,
Barrett?

263
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,105
I'll be there
in a minute.

264
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,681
How do you see this,
Johnson?

265
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:03,986
Well, Mr. Tasserly says,
and Mason swears that nobody got into E Lab.

266
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,288
But I don't think Reagan
committed suicide in there.

267
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,724
Neither do I. What's the
sentry dog doing over here?

268
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,126
He's got a lump on his head
that wasn't there yesterday.

269
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,597
But he was still on patrol this morning?
Mmm-hmm.

270
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,600
I think maybe he might've
been knocked cold for awhile.

271
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:20,669
Of course, being a dog, he couldn't tell me about it.
He just went back to work.

272
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:22,270
Yeah.

273
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,072
Has Raskin got men
going over the fence?

274
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,574
Every inch.

275
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,054
Right in that corner, sir.

276
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:53,669
Dr. Hoffman's terribly distraught.
Insists he must talk to you.

277
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,270
Immediately, in private.

278
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,072
Perhaps you should
see him, sir.

279
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,406
Hmm.

280
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,712
Dr. Hoffman,
this is Dr. Michaelson.

281
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,695
How was it done?

282
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,529
Blow on the head.
No weapon.

283
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,132
Who set the time lock?

284
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,468
I don't know, sir.
I suppose Dr. Baxter.

285
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,570
Another half an hour to go.

286
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,172
Is there any way
to work that combination

287
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,140
and go in before
the time is up?

288
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,009
We've got to find out if
anything has happened in there.

289
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:37,079
No way on earth until those
red lights go off at 8:00.

290
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:40,148
You fool with that door before that,
well, you'd die quick.

291
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,318
It's booby trapped.
A thousand volt charge and lethal gas.

292
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,053
Mr. Raskin.
Yes?

293
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,588
We've found
a break in the fence.

294
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,724
Don't touch it.
We'll be right there. Yes, sir.

295
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,492
Raskin,
have your men move Reagan's body

296
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,794
to one of
the side laboratories.

297
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,128
Yes, sir.

298
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,768
Taped.

299
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:01,603
So that you can't even see
it unless you look closely.

300
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,272
Very careful job.

301
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,208
Raskin, open
the other side.

302
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,246
Cut left to right.
A right-handed man, maybe.

303
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,017
Or a left-handed man who wants us
to think he's right-handed, maybe.

304
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,559
The alarm didn't go off.
The wire hasn't been touched anywhere.

305
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,428
Someone'd really have to know
their way around this place

306
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:28,463
not to trip over this
at night.

307
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,265
The thing
I don't understand,

308
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,434
is how anybody
can get past the dog.

309
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,869
I don't get that, either.

310
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,104
What do you
think happened?

311
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,272
I don't know, sir.

312
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:38,741
What's his name?
Rollo.

313
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:41,944
Can I handle him?
He's under sedation. Go ahead.

314
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:48,116
Easy, Rollo. Easy, boy.
Easy, Rollo.

315
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,685
Easy. Easy.

316
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:52,988
There it is.

317
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,723
What do you
make of that?

318
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,958
Hmm.

319
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,563
Those are cuts.
How'd they get there?

320
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,831
From the wire.

321
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:03,899
Right.

322
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,135
Raskin, you be Rollo.

323
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,474
Now, you tape up your arm,
stick it through, thus...

324
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,142
Okay, grab it.

325
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,512
You hang up Rollo on the
wires so he can't pull free

326
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:18,981
without tearing
his throat out.

327
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,316
He'd make a noise. No.
These dogs are trained not to bark.

328
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:22,317
No matter what. Right?
Right.

329
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,419
Then you clobber him
with something heavy,

330
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,089
you tape up the wire
and you're gone.

331
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,758
When Rollo comes to,
he's got the world's most massive headache.

332
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,060
But being a dog,
he can't tell anybody

333
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,362
so he just goes
back to work. Simple.

334
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,331
So that's how he got in.

335
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:38,500
No. That's how he got out.
Out?

336
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,302
Right. Look at the ends of
these wires where they're bent.

337
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,470
He took Rollo
from the inside.

338
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:48,010
Mr. Barrett, a telegram for you.
It came to our office in town.

339
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:50,012
How come you get
a telegram here?

340
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:51,046
Magic.

341
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,784
I'd certainly like to know
what it says.

342
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,319
I'll bet you would.

343
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,955
Mr. Cavanaugh,
it's 10 minutes to 8:00.

344
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,793
I know it is
an outside possibility,

345
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,462
but it is a possibility
and a horrible one.

346
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:11,299
And you cannot just kick it under the rug.
You have not the right...

347
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:16,438
What is it?

348
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:19,474
We have a very difficult
situation here.

349
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,377
Dr. Hoffman feels that E Lab
should be sealed in concrete.

350
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,711
Why?

351
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:26,414
Because he's afraid that
some chemicals in that vault

352
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:28,150
may have been
broken or tampered with.

353
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,919
Even if they weren't,
we still cannot take the chance.

354
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:34,056
The possibilities are
too monstrous to gamble with.

355
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:36,191
What possibilities?

356
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,163
I think you better
tell them, Doctor.

357
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:49,337
More than 40 bio-chemical weapons
have been developed at Station Three.

358
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:53,508
I will confine myself to two which
we have developed here in E Lab.

359
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:56,411
First, botulinus.

360
00:29:56,444 --> 00:30:00,015
We have 1,200 grams
in six flasks.

361
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,018
If 10 grams of it were allowed
to contaminate a city,

362
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,153
that city is a morgue
in four hours.

363
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:11,593
It is an ideal weapon,
God forgive the phrase,

364
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:14,696
because it destroys
only people.

365
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:20,635
And it oxidizes itself.
In effect, dies, disappears after eight hours.

366
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:22,137
Well, then,
it's safe to go in there.

367
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,073
It's been over eight hours since
that vault door was closed.

368
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:27,775
And if all 1,200 grams of the
botulinus were spilled on the floor,

369
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,312
it would still be safe.

370
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:34,116
The closed air circulating system is still in operation.
So it would be oxidized.

371
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:38,820
That is correct. But there is
something else in there.

372
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:43,625
It is only three weeks since Dr.
Baxter refined it and only three days

373
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:46,995
since he communicated
its existence to anyone.

374
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,864
There's something beyond
the botulinus?

375
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,634
Yes, the second weapon.

376
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,270
Also a virus, air borne.

377
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:58,773
But self-perpetuating.
Indestructible.

378
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:03,045
Once released,
it will multiply at a power beyond our calculations.

379
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:06,114
It perhaps, will never die.

380
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:09,851
To this virus, we have given
a highly unscientific name,

381
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:13,255
but one which
describes it perfectly.

382
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,090
The Satan Bug.

383
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:20,195
If I took the flask which contains
it and exposed it to the air,

384
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:22,965
everyone here would be
dead in a few seconds.

385
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:26,001
California would be a tomb
in a few hours.

386
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:28,536
In a week,

387
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,706
all life,
and I mean all life,

388
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,776
would cease
in the United States.

389
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,845
In two months,
two months at the most,

390
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:41,083
the trapper in Alaska,
the peasant on the Yangtze,

391
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,151
the aborigine in Australia,
dead.

392
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:45,287
All dead.

393
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,059
Because I crushed the flask and exposed
a green colored liquid to the air.

394
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:54,329
Nothing, nothing can stop
the Satan Bug.

395
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:57,299
What would be
the last to go?

396
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:02,037
Perhaps a great albatross winging it's
way around the bottom of the world.

397
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,439
Perhaps an Eskimo
deep in the Arctic.

398
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:10,178
But the seas travel the world
over and so do the winds.

399
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:13,681
One day, one day soon,
they, too, would die.

400
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,019
The Satan Bug is
behind that door.

401
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:21,056
One flask. It has got to be locked up.
It has got to be.

402
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:23,258
I must make you understand.

403
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,660
If botulinus is spilled,
as Mr. Barrett here has just said,

404
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,695
then it does not matter.

405
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:30,898
But, by God,
if someone did get in there,

406
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:34,236
and the Satan Bug is spilled,
and the vault door opened half an inch

407
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,972
and left open,
then the airlock room is lethal.

408
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:41,143
Open this door for more than
five seconds

409
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:45,513
and everything that I have told you will happen,
will happen.

410
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,750
I beg you, sir, seal up the door.
You cannot take the risk.

411
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:54,089
I agree. There's
nothing else we can do.

412
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:55,423
We've no option.

413
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:58,960
We've no option,
but to make sure it's in there and untouched.

414
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,501
All right,
you're all set.

415
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:16,411
Barrett, if that hamster does die,
you'll be contaminated.

416
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:19,581
You won't be able
to come out of there.

417
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:20,582
I know.

418
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:21,683
Well, I trust your intentions,

419
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,752
but if there is
something wrong in there, I...

420
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:27,789
You wonder if I can
go through staying in there?

421
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,724
Yes.
So do I.

422
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,095
Eric, do you have your gun?

423
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:35,797
If I come out of that vault
with this face mask down,

424
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,766
open that airlock door
just a crack and use it.

425
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,268
It's below atmospheric
pressure in there,

426
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:42,604
so the outside air
will rush in.

427
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:47,075
You'll have time.
You'll be safe.

428
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,644
Lee, you know if I have to,
I will use this.

429
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:51,446
I know.

430
00:36:42,517 --> 00:36:44,486
There's no danger.

431
00:36:44,519 --> 00:36:46,988
Baxter's in there.
He's dead.

432
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:14,048
Botulinus.

433
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:17,118
There was a accident last month,
a technician.

434
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,386
Oh, no, it is all right.

435
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,489
There's just the odor now.
It's oxidized.

436
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,692
What about
the Satan Bug, Dr. Hoffman?

437
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:32,434
Don't touch the handle, Doctor.
We need fingerprints.

438
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:45,547
It is gone.

439
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,282
And the botulinus.

440
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:52,554
All the flasks.
Yes. They are all gone.

441
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:56,691
It can't be gone.
It can't be. It's impossible.

442
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:58,393
Baxter walked out
last night.

443
00:37:58,426 --> 00:37:59,761
He was checked out. He was!

444
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,329
Somebody else
walked out.

445
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,666
Good morning. Good morning.
I'm Lee Barrett.

446
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:41,503
Oh, yes, Mr. Barrett.
You're in suite 15.

447
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:44,372
I am?
Yes, sir.

448
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:48,242
You're already registered.

449
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,777
I am?
You certainly are.

450
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,779
Hello, Lee, darling.

451
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,553
Thank you, very much.

452
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,921
Don't mention it.

453
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,658
I thought you'd
never get here.

454
00:39:03,691 --> 00:39:06,794
I've read the newspaper three
times and had four cups of coffee.

455
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:08,195
Well, I hope
you saved one for me.

456
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:09,664
I certainly did.

457
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:18,406
What the hell
are you doing here?

458
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,775
I'm using a new strategy,
darling.

459
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:24,311
I thought you might like
the Mata Hari type.

460
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,548
But that telegram,
"The sooner the better."

461
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,016
Can you think of a better way
to get you here fast?

462
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,918
At least you
could've signed it, damn it.

463
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,988
Hey, your language hasn't improved a bit,
by the way.

464
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,991
You need a wife's influence.

465
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:39,193
Ann, honey,
what are you doing here?

466
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:41,829
Isn't this a beautiful part
of the desert?

467
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:44,566
It's marvelous,
almost a hideaway.

468
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,233
Where is he?

469
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,335
About 10 miles from here.

470
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,404
Well, who's the cover
this time?

471
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:52,273
Me.

472
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,941
You?

473
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,177
You know, you're not very bright this morning,
Lee, darling

474
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,312
and you're certainly not
a bit flattering.

475
00:39:58,345 --> 00:40:01,616
You and I are spending
a quiet little weekend here.

476
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,018
Supposedly.

477
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,787
Oh.

478
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:08,656
What is it this time, Lee?

479
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,425
It's not good.

480
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,827
Why didn't you say so?

481
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,396
I know a darling place
out in the desert for lunch.

482
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,600
Green pepper burritos
and cold Mexican beer.

483
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:19,801
Ole.

484
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,503
Oh, hello, Ann, darling.
Good morning, Dad.

485
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,938
Good morning, sir.
Good to see you again.

486
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:58,806
Hello, Lee.
It's good to see you. Sit down.

487
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,208
Thank you.
That's it for romance today, Lee.

488
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,577
I'll get your breakfast.
No, that can wait.

489
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,079
Sit down, Ann.
There's no reason why you shouldn't hear this.

490
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:07,014
It didn't take you long to
get here from Washington.

491
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,585
No. I'm a member of the Mach two club now.
A little over two hours.

492
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:14,488
No, Ann came ahead of me.
I was going to talk to Baxter.

493
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:16,658
We've just learned
of the Satan Bug.

494
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,760
Baxter hadn't told you?

495
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:22,530
No, not until three days ago.
He was quite disturbed.

496
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,667
So were all of us.
A difficult decision.

497
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,603
Didn't know what to do.
Destroy it or not.

498
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:33,941
Is it gone? Yes, sir.
And all the botulinus.

499
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,612
And I warned him.

500
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:40,648
You set a project like this in motion,
something has to blow.

501
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:41,949
You think Baxter took it?

502
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:44,586
No, I found him in the lab.
He's dead.

503
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:46,854
Baxter's dead?

504
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:48,756
Somehow two men
got into E Lab yesterday.

505
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,826
They must've found Baxter there alone,
just before closing.

506
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:53,995
One of them threw the flask at
him and then shut the vault door,

507
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:56,063
then he walked out
as Baxter.

508
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,364
As Baxter?
There must've been

509
00:41:57,398 --> 00:42:00,568
a reasonable resemblance,
and with Baxter's hat and coat,

510
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,236
everybody expected
to see Baxter.

511
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,304
So they saw Baxter.

512
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:04,739
And?

513
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,174
The other man went through
the fence with the stuff.

514
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:10,011
Reagan must've stumbled
on them in the lab.

515
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,950
Does Cavanaugh
have any ideas?

516
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,218
None. But he's
all over the place

517
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,120
with fingerprint men
and cameras.

518
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:21,823
He'll interrogate everything, everybody,
but he won't come up with anything

519
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:23,591
that will be of any value.

520
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:26,761
You agree
that it was an inside job?

521
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,096
Certainly an inside assist,
but too smooth to be caught

522
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,665
by fingerprints
and conversation.

523
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,566
Anyhow, sir, as you know,

524
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,637
the "how" is not important,
it's the "who" and the "why" that counts.

525
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,638
Yes.

526
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,073
Lee,

527
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:42,176
have they told you just what
this new virus will do?

528
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,911
Dr. Hoffman filled me in.

529
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:49,250
It's throwing that botulinus
that worries me.

530
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:50,752
That's the work
of a lunatic.

531
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:51,953
There're three
possibilities.

532
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,855
Foreign power, possible.

533
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:56,157
Criminals, hijackers,
improbable.

534
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,092
It's the first and the
third that bother me.

535
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,494
What's the third?
Well, you said it, a lunatic.

536
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:03,364
Well,
psychotics don't generally engage in team work like this.

537
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:06,233
Paranoids do, and they're very brilliant,
some of them.

538
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,969
What sort of paranoid?

539
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,137
The kind that we grow
the most of in this country.

540
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,438
A messiah.

541
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,107
What kind of messiah?

542
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,475
Take your pick.

543
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,944
Extreme right,
extreme left.

544
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:19,113
From the "I'd rather be Red than Dead"
fanatics

545
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:21,916
to "Bomb Moscow
right now" fanatics.

546
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,951
My choice, a messiah.

547
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:26,353
Let's say you're right.
What next?

548
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:29,957
A telegram, a letter,
or something to the papers with,

549
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:33,695
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

550
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:36,998
And they'll make demands and end up with,
"Obey or else."

551
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,968
Where were you
at midnight last night?

552
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,071
I beg your pardon?

553
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:46,774
This was delivered
about 10 minutes ago.

554
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:51,813
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

555
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,514
"I have what
you're looking for."

556
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,618
"I order your Citadel
of the Antichrist destroyed."

557
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:01,555
"The President will publicly
announce immediate compliance."

558
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:05,559
"To prove that I am to be obeyed,
there will be an incident."

559
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:06,627
Unsigned.

560
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:30,117
They were carried in.
Routine delivery of crates.

561
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:31,652
Carried in!

562
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:32,854
Phony.

563
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:34,956
My God, Mr. Barrett,
we had no way of knowing.

564
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:38,059
We had no idea they'd do anything like this.
No idea at all. It's...

565
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,393
It's so simple
it's ridiculous.

566
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,395
It's always the simple way
that works.

567
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,529
Nothing?
Nothing.

568
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:44,165
Only the fingerprints
that belong here.

569
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:47,935
The crates were coded with the right number,
the right color.

570
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:51,238
And they were delivered late Friday afternoon,
at 5:35.

571
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,074
No reason for the technicians
to open them.

572
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,241
Exactly.

573
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,977
We're just to see
that nothing gets out.

574
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,645
Nothing. Everything that
comes in stays...

575
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,481
Eric.

576
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:08,289
The General's here.
He got this this morning.

577
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:12,093
It was phoned in last night.

578
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,895
Pay phone,
Los Angeles Airport.

579
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:17,331
My God.

580
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:21,235
How did they even know
he was here?

581
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:23,737
Good question.

582
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:26,607
Well, there's only one thing to do.
Rip this whole place apart.

583
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,110
Get everybody in here.
Everyone else connected with this place.

584
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:33,247
Work them over.
Meanwhile, we'll keep the whole area completely sealed off.

585
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,349
I think, except for
sealing off the area,

586
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,919
we should do
the exact opposite.

587
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,620
What do you mean?

588
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,090
Everybody here, at E Lab,
knows exactly what happened.

589
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:45,692
Certainly whoever
took the bugs know.

590
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:48,195
But nobody outside
knows anything yet.

591
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:50,731
Keep it that way.
Leave it wide open.

592
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:53,835
Why?
So we don't force anybody underground.

593
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:57,839
Eric, there's got to be at least
an inside assist from someone here

594
00:45:57,872 --> 00:45:59,807
at Station Three.

595
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,943
Whoever it is,
let's keep them in the dark.

596
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:03,911
Let's hope they make a move,
and if they do, we'll know it.

597
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,547
It may be the break
we're looking for.

598
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,116
Pretty dangerous, Lee.
Lot of ways to make a slip.

599
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,153
You know how long it'll take
to interrogate everybody.

600
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,990
Cross check stories, and run down leads.
We're under a time gun.

601
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,160
You cannot conduct this
like a normal investigation.

602
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,763
We've got to hope that somebody,
somehow, will lead us to the bugs.

603
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:26,197
Only the flasks are important,
nothing else.

604
00:46:26,198 --> 00:46:27,733
- What do we say about Baxter?
- Tell them nothing.

605
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:30,437
What about this?
It doesn't exist.

606
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,045
I'll give the word
to Raskin.

607
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:40,915
Raskin.

608
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,397
Anything, Mr. Barrett?

609
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,265
Mr. Cavanaugh will be in
in a moment.

610
00:46:58,299 --> 00:47:00,801
That was a very brave thing you did,
Mr. Barrett.

611
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:02,536
To go into that vault.

612
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,372
Maybe I knew there wasn't any risk.
How could you know that?

613
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,707
Well, certainly,
whoever planned this had accurate information.

614
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,410
Very accurate information.

615
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:13,214
Like me you mean?
I'd put me at the top of the list.

616
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,549
Why would you steal
the Satan Bug, Mr. Barrett?

617
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,119
Possession gives one
limitless power.

618
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:19,720
Military power?

619
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,356
And political power
and limitless wealth.

620
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:26,260
The Satan Bug could make one god on earth,
or the devil, if you please.

621
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:28,795
Isn't that enough
to tempt anyone?

622
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:30,297
Dr. Hoffman, how long
will it take us to develop

623
00:47:30,331 --> 00:47:32,900
a vaccine against
the Satan Bug?

624
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:36,270
As a scientist,
I cannot say never, but...

625
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:40,074
Dr. Baxter was not getting anywhere,
none of us were.

626
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,843
Tasserly,
institute a crash program.

627
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:45,046
Now.
Yes, sir.

628
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:52,219
Sir, except
for those present,

629
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:55,089
we're taking the official
position that nothing is missing.

630
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,258
There's been a murder,
that's all.

631
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,692
We say nothing
to anyone.

632
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:00,861
A murder?
What about Dr. Baxter?

633
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:05,366
There's a dead body in there.
It'll keep till Monday. Dr. Baxter's just missing.

634
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:07,868
Meanwhile, of course,
we'll proceed with the investigation.

635
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:10,071
How?
The usual way.

636
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,373
What are we
supposed to do?

637
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:15,576
What do you propose,
Mr. Tasserly?

638
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:19,513
I think I will stay here at Station Three,
if you do not object.

639
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,549
I'm very tired,
and I do not feel like going home.

640
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,884
I'll go with you.

641
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:25,953
Somehow, I...

642
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,521
Well, I should
like to be on call.

643
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:30,691
I will be in D Wing rest area.
Do not hesitate to awaken me.

644
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:32,793
Very well.

645
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,595
The General is here,
Dr. Michaelson.

646
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:38,132
All of this is being transmitted
to Washington in detail.

647
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,102
All right.
I'll be in administration with Tasserly.

648
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:43,437
Station Three personnel?

649
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,671
Yes.

650
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,209
That telegram.

651
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:52,813
Could there have been a leak?
I mean, you don't think it was a phony, do you?

652
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:57,018
It could be a maneuver.
The bugs are gone.

653
00:48:58,252 --> 00:49:01,422
A lunatic
with the killer of all times.

654
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,225
Gives me the creeps.

655
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,628
This whole operation
gives me the creeps.

656
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:58,912
How was Florida?

657
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:00,847
Okay.
Quick trip.

658
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:04,918
No quicker than
it was scheduled.

659
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,288
How'd you make out?

660
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:09,223
I made out fine.

661
00:50:12,025 --> 00:50:13,160
Where's Ainsley?

662
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:14,395
I don't know.

663
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:16,497
When did he get here?

664
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,698
He didn't.

665
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,235
What do you mean,
he didn't?

666
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,836
I mean
he didn't get here.

667
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,938
And he didn't call.

668
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,941
Did you call him?

669
00:50:27,974 --> 00:50:29,210
No, I didn't.

670
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:27,168
Hello.

671
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:29,536
Yeah, this is
Dr. Ostrer's house.

672
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,174
Oh, I'm just the air conditioning man.
I'm fixing the unit.

673
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:37,043
Well, he just stepped out.
He said he'd be right back. Can I take a message?

674
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,946
To call who?

675
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,849
Ah, Ainsley?
How do you spell that? A-N-S...

676
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,420
A-I-N-S-L-E-Y.

677
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:49,290
Ah, that's right, Mr. Ainsley.
What number?

678
00:52:02,002 --> 00:52:03,670
What the hell
are you doing here?

679
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,640
Do you usually make a habit of hanging
around people's swimming pools?

680
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:08,442
I do when I see that.

681
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:27,594
Is that Ostrer?

682
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:29,363
Yeah. They wiped him out.

683
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:34,067
Could he have been
the inside assist?

684
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:36,703
Could be.

685
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:02,429
Cavanaugh, please.

686
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:06,400
Cavanaugh, Barrett here.
I'm at Ostrer's. He's dead.

687
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,270
It's murder to me,
but it looks like it could be suicide.

688
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:10,971
He's floating
at the bottom of the pool.

689
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:13,840
I'll fill you in on the details later,
but more important,

690
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:17,378
see if you can check a call that just
came in to this number a minute ago.

691
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:19,813
What does the name
Ainsley mean to you?

692
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,215
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

693
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:24,751
Uh-huh. That's him.
Millionaire crank.

694
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,087
Right at the top of the list
of crackpots.

695
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,323
A place in New York,
Santa Barbara and another one,

696
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:32,326
I think, somewhere outside
of Phoenix. Nail him.

697
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,395
Don't touch him,
but don't let him out of your sight.

698
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:37,798
And don't let him know
he's being followed. Okay.

699
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,068
Now, honey,
what are you doing here?

700
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:43,704
I was looking for you.

701
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,206
The incident?

702
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,908
Florida.

703
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:54,915
Well,
it's happened, Lee.

704
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:57,618
Key West, Florida.
About an hour and a half ago.

705
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,853
We have helicopters
in the area

706
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:03,557
making 16 millimeter films of
everything they can see from the air.

707
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,559
Meanwhile, the coast line
is blocked off

708
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:09,229
and we're at the present time clearing
the ocean for 200 miles off shore.

709
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:10,631
How'd it happen?

710
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,299
Nobody seems to know, exactly.

711
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,335
One reports says
there was a small explosion.

712
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:16,703
Then everyone downwind
started dying.

713
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:18,339
We've closed down
all the news media,

714
00:54:18,372 --> 00:54:20,907
but we won't be able to
keep it quiet for long.

715
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:22,776
What's the attitude
in Washington?

716
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:25,846
I would describe it
as controlled panic.

717
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:27,314
What do they expect
you to do?

718
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,616
Find whoever it is.
Deal with him.

719
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,618
Buy him off, kill him,
whatever's necessary.

720
00:54:31,652 --> 00:54:33,186
But meanwhile?

721
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,357
Yes. Speaking.

722
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,226
Oh, are they clear?

723
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,297
That bad, huh?

724
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:46,933
When will the film be here?

725
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:51,738
Well, yes, he's here now.
I'll tell him.

726
00:54:51,772 --> 00:54:55,376
I'll get back to you as soon as I've seen the film.
Goodbye.

727
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:58,779
They have the film on Florida and they're
shipping a print out here right away.

728
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:02,849
Cavanaugh tells me that he and his
staff have drawn a complete blank.

729
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,652
They checked out everything and
everybody in Station Three,

730
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:08,288
except Hoffman.
I want you to get on Hoffman.

731
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:11,257
And push Cavanaugh on that Ainsley lead.
That's the only one we've got.

732
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,527
And we're not going to be able to
control this thing very much longer.

733
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,028
Yes, sir.

734
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,331
Oh,
that film is going to arrive at Station Three about 4:00.

735
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:21,067
Get it here
as soon as it arrives.

736
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:23,570
Get me this number,
will you, Ann?

737
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:25,772
Now,
you left the research center in Zurich

738
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:28,074
after you accepted your position here.
Is that correct?

739
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:33,179
Yes. But as you know,
I went on a four-week motor tour before I reported.

740
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:34,781
Reported to Washington?

741
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:37,918
Yes. Well, actually,
to the United States Counsel at Naples

742
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:39,720
before I boarded the Da Vinci.

743
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,787
And that was in...

744
00:55:40,821 --> 00:55:43,990
That was five months ago.
The exact date was...

745
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:45,592
Oh, I have it here.

746
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:49,195
You were out of touch
while touring?

747
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:53,033
I had no set plans.
I motored through the Tyrol, across the Brenner,

748
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:58,238
Lake Lugano.
Naturally, if I had been needed here immediately...

749
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:03,043
It was a... It was kind of
therapeutic irresponsibility.

750
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:05,446
Lee, we just got
the last word on Ainsley.

751
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:07,514
Looks like we're on target.

752
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:09,950
Excuse me.

753
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:12,819
Mr. Barrett.

754
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:13,987
Yes?

755
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:20,260
That bulletin over the radio about the trouble in Florida,
the...

756
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:22,295
It sounded as if...

757
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:23,997
We think
it's the botulinus.

758
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:27,768
My God.
Why, Mr. Barrett?

759
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,835
We don't know.

760
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:31,237
But for what purpose?

761
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:33,640
We're trying to
find that out. Excuse me.

762
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:37,210
He's disappeared.

763
00:56:37,243 --> 00:56:39,846
The Santa Barbara house and the Phoenix
place have been closed for months.

764
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,048
He was last seen
in his New York place.

765
00:56:42,082 --> 00:56:44,117
How long ago was that?
Eight months.

766
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,953
We ran everybody who ever said
hello to him through the wringer.

767
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,154
His ex-housekeeper
in New York

768
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:50,857
said that he told her
he was going on a world tour.

769
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:53,794
Somebody bought the tickets.
Travel agency must have a schedule.

770
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,598
She said Ainsley is not the kind
of man you ask questions of.

771
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:59,432
Well, what does he look like?
We have any pictures?

772
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:00,634
No.

773
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,536
There's no reason for anybody
to keep a file on him.

774
00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:04,938
No pictures, newspaper morgue,
no personal stuff?

775
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:10,443
None. He's an eccentric.
No pictures, no relatives, no public life.

776
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,378
Visual description
from all concerned.

777
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:16,817
Age, 50-something. Height, medium.
Hair, brown. Coloring, normal.

778
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,051
Distinguishing
characteristics, none.

779
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:20,721
No other leads, nothing?
No.

780
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:24,257
If anybody could beat any haystacks
any flatter than we have.

781
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:28,028
Lee, look. He's the only name that's
dropped into this from the outside.

782
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:30,296
And he's vanished
from the face of the earth.

783
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:34,034
Everything we know about him fits
the man that sent that telegram.

784
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:37,771
Lunatic fringe, crank,
rich, with resources.

785
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,840
Now, it's too much
to be a coincidence.

786
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,410
Barrett here.

787
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:46,446
Thank you.
The film is here.

788
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:54,454
I thought something had happened
when I didn't hear from you.

789
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,456
What?

790
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,492
I see.

791
00:58:00,827 --> 00:58:02,729
Everything's perfect here.

792
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:06,600
What?

793
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:10,003
Where?

794
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:13,707
Where?

795
00:58:16,476 --> 00:58:17,844
Yes.

796
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:20,246
Yes.

797
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:22,382
Yes, we can.

798
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:12,799
Well?

799
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,100
No doubt about it.

800
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:26,246
Williams here. Thank you.

801
00:59:28,682 --> 00:59:31,818
Hello, sir.
We're looking at the film now.

802
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:34,788
Michaelson said there's
no question about it.

803
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:40,393
Did they
tell them everything?

804
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,166
No, sir, I'm sorry,
I can't.

805
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,433
Not a thing.

806
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,337
I understand. Goodbye.

807
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,380
Well, they've had to
give the press everything.

808
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:02,382
Except the connection
with Station Three.

809
01:00:05,418 --> 01:00:06,720
Hello.

810
01:00:08,154 --> 01:00:09,189
Yes.

811
01:00:12,893 --> 01:00:14,027
Who is this?

812
01:00:15,328 --> 01:00:16,329
Who is this?

813
01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:24,204
All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.

814
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:26,973
You have seen
what I have done in Florida.

815
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:31,144
You have ignored my order.

816
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:34,915
Continue, and you will sacrifice
hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.

817
01:00:34,948 --> 01:00:36,316
Who is this?

818
01:00:36,917 --> 01:00:39,052
Who is this?

819
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:43,589
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

820
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:45,258
Now listen,
don't hang up.

821
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,160
I'll agree to meet you
anywhere you say.

822
01:00:47,193 --> 01:00:49,462
But you must realize
that we have to discuss...

823
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,837
Operator! Operator!

824
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,873
A call just came through
on this phone, trace it.

825
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,208
Why not?
This is vitally important.

826
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:04,010
Well, why is it impossible?

827
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,281
I see.

828
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:11,484
This number can be reached
by an area code number.

829
01:01:11,517 --> 01:01:13,319
That call could have come from
any place in the country.

830
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:16,189
It would take a week
to track it down, if then.

831
01:01:21,027 --> 01:01:23,563
Don't interrupt.

832
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,800
All right,
I'm listening. Go ahead.

833
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,502
You've seen
what I've done in Florida.

834
01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:31,772
You have ignored my order.

835
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:36,409
Continue, and you will sacrifice
hundreds of thousands of innocent lives.

836
01:01:37,377 --> 01:01:39,245
Los Angeles next.

837
01:01:39,712 --> 01:01:41,748
Noon tomorrow!

838
01:01:41,782 --> 01:01:43,049
Who is this?

839
01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:44,918
Who is this?

840
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:49,455
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

841
01:01:49,489 --> 01:01:51,391
Now listen,
don't hang up.

842
01:01:51,424 --> 01:01:53,293
I'll agree to meet you
anywhere you say.

843
01:01:53,326 --> 01:01:56,196
But you must realize
that we have to discuss...

844
01:02:01,835 --> 01:02:04,237
Operator! Operator!

845
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,140
A call just came through
on this number, trace it.

846
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:14,915
We have to get every man
in the country to find him.

847
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:17,517
We're already doing that,
but it's too late, he could be anywhere.

848
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:21,187
And he has those flasks.

849
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:24,190
Yes, I know that General,
and we can't evacuate Los Angeles.

850
01:02:24,224 --> 01:02:25,658
We don't have time.

851
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:29,129
We'll have to try.
Meanwhile, we keep stalling and hope for a break.

852
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:32,198
Sir.

853
01:02:34,034 --> 01:02:36,536
Don't you think
we should capitulate?

854
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:39,539
Station Three
will only be the beginning.

855
01:02:39,572 --> 01:02:42,809
It's a bluff. It must be.
No one would do such a thing.

856
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,878
Are you prepared
to take that chance?

857
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:46,179
Bring the tape recorder
with you.

858
01:02:46,212 --> 01:02:48,915
There's no point in continuing
this charade of hiding out here.

859
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:51,351
Lee, I'd like to have you
check out...

860
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:53,519
What is it?

861
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,189
Why did he give his name?

862
01:02:56,222 --> 01:03:00,460
It doesn't make any sense.
It would have been better to keep us guessing.

863
01:03:00,493 --> 01:03:02,728
I don't agree.
That's exactly what a paranoid would do.

864
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:05,565
You heard that voice.
A monstrous ego working.

865
01:03:05,598 --> 01:03:08,034
No, sir,
there's something wrong.

866
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:09,936
What?

867
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:13,506
I can't put my finger on it,
I don't really know.

868
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,241
We'll be at Station Three.

869
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:34,694
I checked out
the car for you, Lee.

870
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,097
He got a flat coming down the canyon.
Where?

871
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,532
It was picked up about a
half mile down the road.

872
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,634
A couple hundred feet
above split rock.

873
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:44,070
You remember, we caught
some trout there.

874
01:03:44,104 --> 01:03:46,406
You can still see the marks
on the shoulder.

875
01:03:46,439 --> 01:03:47,840
See you.

876
01:03:52,879 --> 01:03:55,015
What's the significance
of the car, Lee?

877
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:58,251
Nothing, just checking,
you check everything.

878
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:27,113
Is that where
the car got the flat?

879
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:30,183
Well, the car
slipped off the jack.

880
01:04:30,216 --> 01:04:32,052
Obviously,
he tried to dig a hole to get it back on and couldn't,

881
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,154
so he abandoned it.

882
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:37,323
Come on.

883
01:04:50,736 --> 01:04:54,407
All right, sit down here, Ann.
Now follow me on this.

884
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,377
Everybody figures

885
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,745
that whoever
took the bugs got out.

886
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,182
They're gone.

887
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:06,086
The inside assist,
Ostrer, he's dead.

888
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:11,491
But let's suppose that there's another
man that's tied up in all this,

889
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:14,560
who's still here,
who can't get out.

890
01:05:14,594 --> 01:05:17,230
Why does he have to get out?
Why doesn't he just stay here?

891
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:18,931
Because he's got
something vital.

892
01:05:18,965 --> 01:05:22,602
Something that Ainsley's got to have,
and he's got to have in a hurry.

893
01:05:22,635 --> 01:05:23,970
I don't understand.

894
01:05:25,405 --> 01:05:27,573
Two men got into E Lab.

895
01:05:27,607 --> 01:05:30,076
One got out as Baxter,
he walked out.

896
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,944
The other one through
the fence with the bugs.

897
01:05:31,978 --> 01:05:33,746
Let's say that they met
this third man,

898
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:36,116
who took all the flasks,
except two,

899
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:39,919
which he gave to them, and then they took off,
probably in Baxter's car.

900
01:05:39,952 --> 01:05:42,922
One flask for Florida.
One for Los Angeles.

901
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:44,457
I've got that.

902
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:49,029
Now, let's say that this third man
takes off with the rest of the flasks.

903
01:05:49,062 --> 01:05:51,231
But he's got one more thing
that he must do.

904
01:05:51,264 --> 01:05:53,733
Knock off Ostrer,
who's a threat somehow.

905
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:55,735
Let's say
he knocks off Ostrer,

906
01:05:55,768 --> 01:05:58,304
comes down this road,
free and clear.

907
01:05:58,338 --> 01:06:00,440
And then the nightmare
of all criminals happens.

908
01:06:00,473 --> 01:06:02,508
The senseless accident.

909
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,511
The flat.
Right!

910
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,214
He tries to fix it,
the car slips off the jack.

911
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:11,084
Now he's stuck.
What would you do?

912
01:06:11,117 --> 01:06:12,618
I'd hitchhike down the road.

913
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:13,853
But the bugs?

914
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,388
You couldn't take a chance
on taking them with you

915
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:16,956
and you wouldn't leave them
in the car.

916
01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:19,559
So, where would you put them
where they'd be safe?

917
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:21,994
Where you could get to
them when you were free to

918
01:06:22,028 --> 01:06:24,064
and where they'd stay cool.

919
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,135
The water.

920
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:30,203
I'd hide them in the water.

921
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,637
That's what I think.

922
01:06:54,494 --> 01:06:55,728
Lee!

923
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:46,246
Whose car was that?

924
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:47,947
Just stand.

925
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:50,983
Perfectly still.

926
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:56,356
Handle that gently.

927
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:02,262
Those misses were intentional.

928
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:04,464
Stand exactly
where you are, Ann.

929
01:08:13,973 --> 01:08:16,709
And that I presume
was Doctor Baxter?

930
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:18,978
Just put the flask
back in the box.

931
01:09:44,364 --> 01:09:45,665
Sit down.

932
01:10:08,053 --> 01:10:10,290
There's a phone call for you in the administration,
Mr. Cavanaugh.

933
01:10:10,323 --> 01:10:11,491
Thank you.

934
01:10:32,945 --> 01:10:34,647
Absolutely no sign of them.

935
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,649
We checked out
Barrett's car.

936
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:39,251
No sign of violence
there or anywhere.

937
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:42,254
Just some footprints down by the bank of the stream.
Nothing else.

938
01:10:42,288 --> 01:10:44,189
Have you heard
anything here?

939
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,725
No.

940
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:47,827
He hasn't been missing long.
He could be anywhere.

941
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,295
You know what
he's like, sir.

942
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:53,466
I don't understand why Barrett is
so interested in Dr. Hoffman's car.

943
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,934
I don't either, sir.

944
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:56,436
The Highway Patrol
officer said...

945
01:10:57,036 --> 01:10:58,571
Yes?

946
01:10:58,604 --> 01:11:00,706
Mr. Cavanaugh?
Johnson's on the line.

947
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,207
Put him on.
Hello?

948
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:04,276
Yes, Johnson.

949
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,512
No sign of them in any of the
places we've looked in town.

950
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:08,914
Keep looking.
Yes, sir.

951
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:13,619
The officer said that Barrett just wanted
to know where the doctor had had the flat.

952
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:17,557
Well, so what? We knew about it.
You had a flat last night.

953
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:21,427
You started to hitchhike,
they picked you up outside of town and brought you here.

954
01:11:21,461 --> 01:11:22,828
I was very lucky.

955
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:26,031
That road is lonely at night,
but I was picked up in the canyon.

956
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:27,367
Not outside of town.

957
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,701
Yes.

958
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:32,037
Barrett is liable to call us
anytime from anywhere.

959
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:34,340
I think it means nothing.

960
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:35,708
I've pulled
all the roadblocks.

961
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:38,478
You want me to put them back,
just in case?

962
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:39,579
No point in that.

963
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,214
Yes?

964
01:11:42,247 --> 01:11:43,749
There's a call
for Dr. Hoffman.

965
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:46,452
Put it through. Doctor.

966
01:11:46,486 --> 01:11:48,721
Doctor Hoffman?
Yes.

967
01:11:48,754 --> 01:11:50,990
Hello, Gregor,
this is Donald.

968
01:11:51,023 --> 01:11:55,728
Sorry to disturb you,
but we were going fishing this afternoon, remember?

969
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:58,230
Well, I... I couldn't,
I was tied up here.

970
01:11:58,263 --> 01:12:01,033
Sorry you missed out,
the fishing was good.

971
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:04,837
Do you have to work tonight?
We're at your trailer. How about dinner?

972
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,973
Well, Donald,
I... I do not see how...

973
01:12:08,007 --> 01:12:12,778
I wish you could.
There's something I want to talk to you about.

974
01:12:12,812 --> 01:12:14,346
Well, it would be
very nice, Donald...

975
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:16,849
There's no need
for you to stay here now.

976
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:19,585
Jeff, run the Doctor home.
All right, Eric.

977
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:20,786
Thank you.

978
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,389
I will be there in a few minutes, Donald.
Good.

979
01:12:47,547 --> 01:12:49,549
Thank you.

980
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,148
He stopped on
the road, slid down the bank,

981
01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:26,318
and got to the flasks
before we did.

982
01:13:26,351 --> 01:13:27,987
This is the only place
we had to hide 'em.

983
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,356
I know it was taking
a chance to call you.

984
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,560
But I was afraid you were caught.
He knew about your car.

985
01:13:34,594 --> 01:13:38,197
Now we're stuck.
There are roadblocks all over the place.

986
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:41,400
Everything's fine, Donald.

987
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:45,337
Nobody's suspicious,
and the roadblocks have been removed.

988
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:51,243
It seems that Mr. Barrett
is so unpredictable

989
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:54,246
that nothing has been made
of their disappearance.

990
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,984
Did Los Angeles
go as planned, Veretti?

991
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,285
I put it there.

992
01:14:09,161 --> 01:14:10,663
We will take them
with us.

993
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,097
That's dangerous.

994
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:14,399
If there is any trouble,
they will be our best protection.

995
01:14:23,843 --> 01:14:27,479
There's nothing happening yet.
They're still all in the trailer.

996
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:29,849
What about
the manager?

997
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,483
Oh, we're keeping
the manager out of the way.

998
01:14:31,517 --> 01:14:33,586
Do you think Barrett saw you?
Possibly.

999
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:35,955
But he'd never recognize me,
he's never seen me before.

1000
01:14:35,988 --> 01:14:37,422
Can you see anything
going on in there?

1001
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:42,061
There's no movement, no sound,
no, nothing happening.

1002
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:43,395
Keep on the line.

1003
01:14:43,428 --> 01:14:45,164
Why would Dr. Hoffman
be connected with this?

1004
01:14:45,197 --> 01:14:46,498
Why? I don't understand.

1005
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:48,601
He checked out perfectly.
There's nothing in his background

1006
01:14:48,634 --> 01:14:51,136
to indicate that he's...
Dr. Michaelson, please.

1007
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,138
We've got to grab them, sir.
Right now.

1008
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:55,274
Certainly not,
Cavanaugh.

1009
01:14:55,307 --> 01:14:58,944
Now, we know that Barrett is in Dr.
Hoffman's trailer with two strange men.

1010
01:14:58,978 --> 01:15:02,748
And we know that Dr. Hoffman is there
and he's connected with those men.

1011
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:07,086
And we know Dr. Hoffman's car had
some special significance to Barrett.

1012
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:09,088
And that's all we know.

1013
01:15:09,121 --> 01:15:13,158
We don't even know if Barrett went
there willingly or unwillingly.

1014
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:15,394
Let me grab them, sir,
and I'll find out.

1015
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,496
I don't think you'd find out
anything that would be worth

1016
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:19,963
losing the only advantage
we have.

1017
01:15:19,997 --> 01:15:21,768
What is that?

1018
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:25,871
They will lead us
to Ainsley, to the flasks.

1019
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:29,174
Only the flasks
are important.

1020
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:32,377
This is the break
we've been praying for.

1021
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:35,715
They're going to leave.
We let them.

1022
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:38,851
Then we shadow them,
very carefully.

1023
01:15:38,884 --> 01:15:42,855
Let one eager beaver show our hand,
and we're through.

1024
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:44,189
Now set it up.

1025
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:48,994
In the desert we're okay,
not much traffic.

1026
01:15:49,028 --> 01:15:50,696
But we could lose them
in the first town.

1027
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:52,031
And what if they head
for that mess that'll be

1028
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:54,299
coming out of Los Angeles?
We'll change our strategy by then.

1029
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:56,001
At least we'll know
which way they're headed.

1030
01:15:56,035 --> 01:15:57,737
Set it up.
Yes, sir.

1031
01:16:10,082 --> 01:16:11,717
The evacuation of
Los Angeles is under way.

1032
01:16:13,753 --> 01:16:19,358
It is too early to say yet how effective this will be,
or how possible it will be.

1033
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:22,594
There is no further official word as
to the exact imminence of the threat.

1034
01:16:22,628 --> 01:16:25,665
It means nothing.
There are military training fields all around here.

1035
01:16:25,698 --> 01:16:28,701
Incident in Florida
is related to this situation.

1036
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:31,236
I'm staying above
and behind them.

1037
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:34,173
They're still traveling west
on 17.

1038
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,808
They seem to be stalling.

1039
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,410
They're almost
going around in circles.

1040
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:40,279
Why?

1041
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:44,449
Evasive action.
They're taking the long way to wherever they're going.

1042
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:54,894
It's getting a little difficult
to keep them in sight.

1043
01:16:54,927 --> 01:16:58,430
This is pretty rough country and
it's closing in on the road.

1044
01:16:58,463 --> 01:17:00,299
I don't like this section
they're going through.

1045
01:17:00,332 --> 01:17:03,468
It's impossible to keep visual contact
without the chopper tipping its hand.

1046
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:07,239
There are only three points they can come out of there,
here, here and here.

1047
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:08,974
You have men covering
all of them, haven't you?

1048
01:17:09,008 --> 01:17:12,044
Yes, sir. I'll double up
here and here.

1049
01:17:12,077 --> 01:17:14,246
I'm going to lose them
for a long stretch now.

1050
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:15,881
Unless I close in.

1051
01:17:15,915 --> 01:17:17,817
Don't close up,
stay out of sight

1052
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,219
until you can pick them up on
the other side of the section.

1053
01:17:20,252 --> 01:17:21,153
Will do.

1054
01:17:21,186 --> 01:17:23,989
Where's your follow car?
Right here.

1055
01:17:24,023 --> 01:17:26,892
Tell him not to move until
he can make absolutely sure

1056
01:17:26,926 --> 01:17:28,460
that the road ahead is clear.
Yes, sir.

1057
01:17:31,697 --> 01:17:35,801
Hold your position unless you
can see the road is clear ahead.

1058
01:17:35,835 --> 01:17:37,036
Understood.

1059
01:18:05,965 --> 01:18:07,967
You'll have
no problem, Veretti?

1060
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,001
None.

1061
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:40,833
You know where I'll be.

1062
01:18:40,866 --> 01:18:42,734
It'd be better
if we stayed together.

1063
01:20:29,308 --> 01:20:31,376
Got 'em again.

1064
01:20:31,410 --> 01:20:33,612
They're moving down the grade.

1065
01:20:33,645 --> 01:20:35,480
They're going to be out
in the open desert any minute.

1066
01:20:36,916 --> 01:20:40,185
Back away to 1-1-9-30
and stay out of sight.

1067
01:20:40,819 --> 01:20:42,154
Right.

1068
01:20:42,187 --> 01:20:44,423
Tell your follow car
to close up.

1069
01:20:44,456 --> 01:20:46,158
Zebra to X-Ray.

1070
01:20:46,191 --> 01:20:48,460
Position ahead
clear now, move up.

1071
01:20:48,493 --> 01:20:50,429
Understood. Moving up.

1072
01:21:03,275 --> 01:21:04,509
Donald!

1073
01:21:11,683 --> 01:21:13,052
Is he following?

1074
01:21:13,919 --> 01:21:15,187
I don't know.

1075
01:21:18,123 --> 01:21:19,324
Take that turn.

1076
01:21:33,172 --> 01:21:36,575
They've turned left
onto Seco Road now.

1077
01:21:36,608 --> 01:21:40,545
They slowed down and...
Well, for a moment we got awfully close to them.

1078
01:21:42,847 --> 01:21:46,818
Did they see you?
Well, I'm not sure, they might have.

1079
01:21:46,851 --> 01:21:48,653
You want us to take them
if they spot us?

1080
01:21:48,687 --> 01:21:50,555
No!

1081
01:21:50,589 --> 01:21:53,225
Only if they stop, and if they do,
get on the radio immediately.

1082
01:21:53,258 --> 01:21:54,493
Understood.

1083
01:21:57,029 --> 01:21:59,598
Pull in up there
and let's see what this is.

1084
01:22:27,492 --> 01:22:28,827
Damn!

1085
01:22:30,229 --> 01:22:31,997
Hello, Zebra, come in!
This is X-Ray.

1086
01:22:33,098 --> 01:22:35,434
Hello, Zebra, come in.
This is X-Ray.

1087
01:22:37,236 --> 01:22:38,970
Hello.

1088
01:22:39,004 --> 01:22:40,472
Ah, it's dead.

1089
01:22:48,613 --> 01:22:50,849
Come out
and keep your hands up!

1090
01:22:53,385 --> 01:22:55,887
Show yourself and keep
your hands in the air.

1091
01:23:16,975 --> 01:23:19,044
Come out
and show yourself.

1092
01:23:37,562 --> 01:23:39,364
We're armed
with riot guns.

1093
01:23:39,398 --> 01:23:41,833
Now, come out of there
with your hands up!

1094
01:23:54,079 --> 01:23:55,680
All right,
drop that gun.

1095
01:23:55,714 --> 01:23:57,382
Tell them I'll throw it.

1096
01:23:58,483 --> 01:24:00,419
Don't move.

1097
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:03,122
Just do exactly
whatever he tells you to do.

1098
01:24:04,689 --> 01:24:07,159
Toss the shotguns
on the ground.

1099
01:24:10,829 --> 01:24:12,364
Throw them down.

1100
01:24:20,705 --> 01:24:22,441
And the revolvers.

1101
01:24:23,742 --> 01:24:25,110
Easy!

1102
01:24:33,084 --> 01:24:38,257
I'm now hovering over 1-1-9-3-3-0.
Nothing but empty road.

1103
01:24:39,524 --> 01:24:40,525
Stay put.

1104
01:25:04,716 --> 01:25:05,917
Veretti?

1105
01:25:09,988 --> 01:25:11,223
What about the girl?

1106
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:13,658
Why don't you
take her with you?

1107
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:14,759
Lee.

1108
01:25:16,961 --> 01:25:18,930
Take her with you.

1109
01:25:18,963 --> 01:25:20,399
Ann,

1110
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:22,901
get out of here.

1111
01:25:33,445 --> 01:25:36,415
What the hell kind of a thing was that?
Shh!

1112
01:25:36,448 --> 01:25:38,483
Don't you see,
he's going to throw the flask.

1113
01:25:38,517 --> 01:25:43,021
It'll probably come through
one of those two holes.

1114
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:45,457
Where ever it comes through, we've got to grab it.
We've got to.

1115
01:25:45,490 --> 01:25:48,092
If it smashes on the wall or the
floor or any of these objects,

1116
01:25:48,126 --> 01:25:50,161
the three of us
are dead men.

1117
01:25:56,134 --> 01:25:59,037
If we miss it,
I'll douse it with this.

1118
01:25:59,070 --> 01:26:01,840
It's hygroscopic.
It has an affinity for water.

1119
01:26:05,143 --> 01:26:07,178
This isn't water,
it's kerosene.

1120
01:26:07,212 --> 01:26:10,482
It's got water in it.
Besides, it's all we've got.

1121
01:26:46,418 --> 01:26:48,420
Sand. Put sand on it!

1122
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:49,721
Lee!

1123
01:27:15,011 --> 01:27:16,679
Let's go!

1124
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:24,587
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.

1125
01:27:24,621 --> 01:27:27,156
Something's wrong,
Cavanaugh.

1126
01:27:27,189 --> 01:27:29,559
Two more minutes,
and we go in there.

1127
01:27:29,592 --> 01:27:31,961
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Come in, X-Ray!

1128
01:28:09,699 --> 01:28:12,569
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray.

1129
01:28:13,703 --> 01:28:16,839
Come in, X-Ray.
This is Zebra, come in, X-Ray.

1130
01:28:25,314 --> 01:28:29,151
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.
Zebra to X-Ray, come in.

1131
01:28:29,185 --> 01:28:31,588
Come in, X-Ray, come in.

1132
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:40,697
Zebra to X-Ray.
Zebra to X-Ray.

1133
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:42,599
Come in.

1134
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:47,103
Zebra to X-Ray,
come in.

1135
01:28:47,136 --> 01:28:50,039
Come in, X-Ray.

1136
01:28:50,072 --> 01:28:52,609
This is Zebra,
come in, X-Ray.

1137
01:28:52,642 --> 01:28:55,077
Come in,
this is Barrett.

1138
01:28:55,111 --> 01:28:57,714
Cone in, X-Ray,
this is Zebra.

1139
01:28:59,782 --> 01:29:02,351
Come in,
this is Barrett.

1140
01:29:02,385 --> 01:29:04,320
Cone in, X-Ray,
come in.

1141
01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:48,164
Move and I'll smash it!
I'll never be taken alive.

1142
01:29:48,197 --> 01:29:51,434
Your friends can't help you.
You're on your own now.

1143
01:29:51,468 --> 01:29:53,202
I always have been.

1144
01:29:54,704 --> 01:29:58,675
You might be able to take this away
from me before I could smash it.

1145
01:29:58,708 --> 01:30:00,342
But it would not help you.

1146
01:30:00,376 --> 01:30:01,811
The flask in Los Angeles.

1147
01:30:01,844 --> 01:30:03,713
Exactly.

1148
01:30:03,746 --> 01:30:06,282
You cannot evacuate the city.

1149
01:30:06,315 --> 01:30:10,487
If anything happens to me,
Los Angeles will be a cemetery by this time tomorrow.

1150
01:30:11,220 --> 01:30:13,490
If things go your way

1151
01:30:13,523 --> 01:30:17,059
and it's announced that Station
Three is being destroyed,

1152
01:30:17,093 --> 01:30:20,196
will you take me to where the
flask is and immobilize it?

1153
01:30:22,499 --> 01:30:25,367
Perhaps you had better
get in the car, Mr. Barrett.

1154
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:32,642
On the other side.

1155
01:30:49,358 --> 01:30:50,693
I determined in
the laboratory

1156
01:30:50,727 --> 01:30:54,196
that only a four and a half pound
pressure shatters this flask.

1157
01:30:55,965 --> 01:30:57,767
I can easily apply that.

1158
01:31:12,314 --> 01:31:14,350
I spotted
the station wagon again.

1159
01:31:14,383 --> 01:31:17,787
They're still moving north
on Seco Road.

1160
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:19,889
Any sign of
the follow car?

1161
01:31:21,090 --> 01:31:23,526
No.

1162
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:27,664
It looks like there's some kind of
fire back there where they came from.

1163
01:31:27,697 --> 01:31:29,932
A lot of orange flame
on the horizon.

1164
01:31:29,966 --> 01:31:33,536
You'd better get
somebody in there, fast.

1165
01:31:33,570 --> 01:31:36,906
What are your plans now,
what do you intend to do, Mr. Ainsley?

1166
01:31:38,074 --> 01:31:40,242
Ah, I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

1167
01:31:40,276 --> 01:31:42,945
Ainsley's been missing for months and
Hoffman's been on the scene for months.

1168
01:31:42,979 --> 01:31:45,347
Or at least you're an
impersonation of the real Hoffman.

1169
01:31:45,381 --> 01:31:46,816
What happened to him?

1170
01:31:49,118 --> 01:31:51,420
That's not hard to figure.
Gregor Hoffman, living in Vienna,

1171
01:31:51,453 --> 01:31:52,555
hired by Baxter
from Austria.

1172
01:31:52,589 --> 01:31:55,692
Did you kill him
or did you have him killed?

1173
01:31:55,725 --> 01:31:58,227
You're no biochemist,
how did you fool them?

1174
01:31:58,260 --> 01:32:00,496
I am a biochemist,
Mr. Barrett, of sorts.

1175
01:32:00,529 --> 01:32:02,464
If you were more familiar
with the name Ainsley,

1176
01:32:02,498 --> 01:32:05,101
you'd know I made my fortune
in patent medicines.

1177
01:32:05,134 --> 01:32:08,204
Sometimes a little bit of
knowledge goes a long way.

1178
01:32:08,237 --> 01:32:09,872
The accent? Easy.

1179
01:32:09,906 --> 01:32:11,808
I lived for years
in Austria.

1180
01:32:11,841 --> 01:32:14,343
Besides, Gregor Hoffman,
though he lived an obscure life,

1181
01:32:14,376 --> 01:32:16,278
was a world famous chemist.

1182
01:32:16,312 --> 01:32:18,815
You don't ask a famous
chemist the formula for salt.

1183
01:32:18,848 --> 01:32:20,917
But Ostrer did.
You had everyone fooled but Ostrer.

1184
01:32:20,950 --> 01:32:23,953
He knew you weren't the real Hoffman,
so he died, too.

1185
01:32:23,986 --> 01:32:26,088
That tone is surprisingly juvenile,
Mr. Barrett.

1186
01:32:26,122 --> 01:32:28,490
I believe that hundreds of people
might have died in Florida.

1187
01:32:28,524 --> 01:32:31,093
This afternoon when I was interrogating you,
you heard Cavanaugh say that.

1188
01:32:31,127 --> 01:32:33,362
Ainsley was our man.
Then you knew what to do.

1189
01:32:33,395 --> 01:32:34,831
Somehow you made
two telephone calls.

1190
01:32:34,864 --> 01:32:36,899
One to your boys to pick up the
flasks where you had to leave them

1191
01:32:36,933 --> 01:32:38,167
in the stream and the
other to the General.

1192
01:32:38,200 --> 01:32:40,469
So you could give us
your ultimatum on Los Angeles.

1193
01:32:40,502 --> 01:32:42,672
Use the name C.R. Ainsley so
he would drop the road blocks

1194
01:32:42,705 --> 01:32:44,974
and you could get out,
and he fell for it.

1195
01:32:45,007 --> 01:32:46,242
That's correct.

1196
01:32:46,275 --> 01:32:48,177
I didn't make the telephone calls somehow,
Mr. Barrett.

1197
01:32:48,210 --> 01:32:49,946
I made them from
Station Three.

1198
01:32:49,979 --> 01:32:53,082
As you're so fond of saying there's
no such thing as perfect security.

1199
01:33:03,459 --> 01:33:04,827
Don't try it, Mr. Barrett.

1200
01:33:04,861 --> 01:33:06,896
You're lucky but you're mortal.
We all are.

1201
01:33:12,201 --> 01:33:16,572
Tank vehicles carrying
liquids, assembly point B.

1202
01:33:16,605 --> 01:33:19,842
Ambulance section
re-designated, C.

1203
01:33:19,876 --> 01:33:24,513
Repeat, ambulance section
re-designated, C.

1204
01:33:24,546 --> 01:33:28,350
Control requests the following be
read at five minute intervals.

1205
01:33:28,384 --> 01:33:31,854
An unidentified scientific
research installation

1206
01:33:31,888 --> 01:33:34,924
based in Southern California
has ceased operation.

1207
01:33:34,957 --> 01:33:38,928
It will be dismantled and cease
to exist. End announcement.

1208
01:33:52,675 --> 01:33:54,110
There he is.

1209
01:33:54,143 --> 01:33:55,544
Who's that with him?

1210
01:33:55,577 --> 01:33:57,146
I don't know.

1211
01:34:16,465 --> 01:34:18,701
You're under arrest,
Doctor Hoffman.

1212
01:34:20,102 --> 01:34:21,871
You're Lee Barrett, aren't you?
That's right.

1213
01:34:21,904 --> 01:34:23,305
What are you
doing here, Barrett?

1214
01:34:23,339 --> 01:34:25,007
That's a long story.

1215
01:34:25,975 --> 01:34:28,044
Get out of the car, Doctor.

1216
01:34:28,077 --> 01:34:31,413
Be careful,
he's got a flask in his pocket.

1217
01:34:37,453 --> 01:34:39,421
All right,
hand it over, Doctor.

1218
01:34:40,990 --> 01:34:42,291
Right now.

1219
01:34:44,126 --> 01:34:45,862
The end of the line?

1220
01:34:56,973 --> 01:34:59,141
All right,
get into the car, Doctor.

1221
01:35:01,143 --> 01:35:03,312
Better come along
with us, Barrett.

1222
01:35:06,282 --> 01:35:07,716
How did you get here?

1223
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:08,818
We're spread
all over the place.

1224
01:35:08,851 --> 01:35:10,586
This is one of
50 we're covering.

1225
01:35:10,619 --> 01:35:12,154
What about the girl
and the two other guys?

1226
01:35:12,188 --> 01:35:13,890
I don't know.
Where's Cavanaugh?

1227
01:35:13,923 --> 01:35:15,992
They could be anywhere.
Our orders were to pick up Hoffman,

1228
01:35:16,025 --> 01:35:17,326
stay off the radio,
and don't say a word

1229
01:35:17,359 --> 01:35:19,461
until we get him
to Station Three.

1230
01:35:30,239 --> 01:35:33,175
Have you got enough sense
to keep your mouth shut?

1231
01:35:33,209 --> 01:35:34,210
Yes.

1232
01:35:36,012 --> 01:35:39,048
We've got a jack-knifed truck up here.
You can turn your engine off.

1233
01:35:39,081 --> 01:35:42,952
It won't be long.
The tow truck will have it out of here in a few minutes.

1234
01:35:42,985 --> 01:35:44,386
Anybody hurt?

1235
01:35:44,420 --> 01:35:46,055
No, he was lucky.

1236
01:35:55,564 --> 01:35:58,134
We got a jack-knifed truck,
it won't be long.

1237
01:36:11,547 --> 01:36:15,151
Won't be long he says.
Did you ever hear a cop say anything else?

1238
01:36:15,184 --> 01:36:16,785
It'll be hours.

1239
01:36:16,819 --> 01:36:20,622
By that time,
that mess from L.A. will hit us and we'll never move.

1240
01:36:22,024 --> 01:36:25,127
Look at all those cans
and busted beer bottles.

1241
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:28,931
You'd think people wouldn't throw
things out there like that.

1242
01:36:28,965 --> 01:36:30,432
You got a match?

1243
01:36:30,466 --> 01:36:32,368
Would you look at the jerk
handling that tow truck?

1244
01:36:32,401 --> 01:36:35,004
He's worse than the man
that was driving the rig.

1245
01:36:35,037 --> 01:36:36,505
Oh, boy,
that's all we need.

1246
01:36:36,538 --> 01:36:38,274
A sidewalk superintendent.

1247
01:36:39,275 --> 01:36:41,110
Wise guy, huh?

1248
01:37:06,135 --> 01:37:07,603
There's your daughter,
but what's happened to Barrett?

1249
01:37:07,636 --> 01:37:09,205
Where's Hoffman?

1250
01:37:11,140 --> 01:37:13,876
Dad! Dad!

1251
01:37:13,910 --> 01:37:16,545
Dad, Lee's dead.
They threw a flask,

1252
01:37:16,578 --> 01:37:18,080
they threw a flask
back at the gas station.

1253
01:37:18,114 --> 01:37:19,715
What happened to Barrett,
where is he?

1254
01:37:19,748 --> 01:37:21,383
You've got to go clear out the area.
He's at the station.

1255
01:37:21,417 --> 01:37:23,920
Don't you understand?
That man Veretti, he threw a flask.

1256
01:37:23,953 --> 01:37:25,187
Sir.

1257
01:37:29,225 --> 01:37:30,092
Where is the Satan Bug?

1258
01:37:30,126 --> 01:37:31,460
Hoffman took it.
He changed cars

1259
01:37:31,493 --> 01:37:33,229
and he went back the way we came from.
What kind of car was it?

1260
01:37:33,262 --> 01:37:35,131
It was a green Ford sedan.

1261
01:37:35,164 --> 01:37:36,565
License?
Oh, I don't know,

1262
01:37:36,598 --> 01:37:40,002
I couldn't see it very clearly.
It was FGA, something, 7, I think.

1263
01:37:40,036 --> 01:37:42,071
Put it on the radio.
Hey, give me that stuff.

1264
01:37:42,104 --> 01:37:43,772
Dad, you've got to go back
and clear out that area.

1265
01:37:43,805 --> 01:37:45,841
That's all right, dear,
that's all right.

1266
01:37:45,874 --> 01:37:46,943
The flask is harmless now.

1267
01:37:46,976 --> 01:37:49,912
The station burned.
There's nothing to worry about.

1268
01:37:49,946 --> 01:37:52,548
We found the bodies of Cavanaugh's men,
but not Lee's.

1269
01:37:52,581 --> 01:37:54,083
But Lee was in the building.
He was in the building.

1270
01:37:54,116 --> 01:37:58,720
Well, he's not there now.
Ann, Los Angeles,

1271
01:37:58,754 --> 01:38:01,991
did anyone say anything
about Los Angeles? Anything?

1272
01:38:02,024 --> 01:38:03,359
No. Nothing.

1273
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:05,561
Put everything you've got
on Hoffman's car.

1274
01:38:05,594 --> 01:38:07,263
Yes, sir.
We're already on it.

1275
01:38:07,296 --> 01:38:09,331
But there are an awful lot of
green Fords around.

1276
01:38:09,365 --> 01:38:12,568
And there's nothing on these
guys except this stuff.

1277
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:16,638
Guns, money, watches,
phony drivers license

1278
01:38:17,739 --> 01:38:19,608
and keys.

1279
01:38:19,641 --> 01:38:22,544
Maybe one of the keys
fits something in Los Angeles.

1280
01:38:22,578 --> 01:38:24,613
But how the hell
do we check that?

1281
01:39:03,485 --> 01:39:05,421
Sounds like the ignition.

1282
01:39:28,844 --> 01:39:30,746
Take a look
at that fuel pump.

1283
01:39:46,628 --> 01:39:48,897
You didn't really think that I'd
fall for those goons of yours

1284
01:39:48,930 --> 01:39:51,100
posing as Cavanaugh's men,
did you?

1285
01:40:00,109 --> 01:40:02,411
Okay, I've got the gun now.

1286
01:40:02,444 --> 01:40:05,447
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1287
01:40:05,481 --> 01:40:07,716
before that copter of yours
settles down.

1288
01:40:07,749 --> 01:40:09,551
You haven't given me any
reason why I won't smash this.

1289
01:40:10,119 --> 01:40:14,323
This is the end of the line,
Ainsley.

1290
01:40:14,356 --> 01:40:15,891
For real now.

1291
01:40:15,924 --> 01:40:17,593
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1292
01:40:17,626 --> 01:40:19,528
or I'll blow
a hole in your head!

1293
01:40:23,265 --> 01:40:26,802
You're psychotic,
but don't be stupid.

1294
01:40:26,835 --> 01:40:29,871
If I blow a hole in your head
or you drop that bottle,

1295
01:40:29,905 --> 01:40:32,741
you'll die,
then you'll have nothing.

1296
01:40:32,774 --> 01:40:35,911
Perhaps I am psychotic,
but I'm certainly not stupid.

1297
01:40:35,944 --> 01:40:39,381
If I smash this,
I wouldn't die, Mr. Barrett.

1298
01:40:41,417 --> 01:40:42,584
Why do you think
Baxter waited so long

1299
01:40:42,618 --> 01:40:44,953
before telling anyone
about the Satan Bug.

1300
01:40:44,986 --> 01:40:46,822
Why do you think he was working nights?
Weekends?

1301
01:40:46,855 --> 01:40:48,157
The vaccine!

1302
01:40:49,391 --> 01:40:51,693
Well, I waited for
the vaccine.

1303
01:40:51,727 --> 01:40:54,863
Two days ago he made it,
that's why he had to die and Ostrer.

1304
01:40:54,896 --> 01:40:56,965
You were wrong
about him, too.

1305
01:40:56,998 --> 01:40:58,734
He didn't suspect me.
He didn't suspect anyone.

1306
01:40:58,767 --> 01:41:00,469
He just knew
about the vaccine

1307
01:41:00,502 --> 01:41:03,105
and now I'm the only one
who has the formula.

1308
01:41:03,139 --> 01:41:05,207
And the vaccine is
in my bloodstream.

1309
01:41:05,241 --> 01:41:07,176
I'm immune!
I won't die, I'm immune!

1310
01:41:07,743 --> 01:41:11,046
But you told us
what the Satan Bug would do.

1311
01:41:11,079 --> 01:41:15,651
You mean to say that you'd live on this world alone?
By yourself?

1312
01:41:15,684 --> 01:41:18,654
I told you about the Satan Bug
to keep you from finding Baxter.

1313
01:41:18,687 --> 01:41:20,856
Even so,
he believed every word I said.

1314
01:41:20,889 --> 01:41:24,460
But I'm not sure
how good a biochemist he was.

1315
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:26,928
Some scientists thought that the
H-bomb would start a chain reaction

1316
01:41:26,962 --> 01:41:30,632
that would blow up the world,
but it didn't.

1317
01:41:30,666 --> 01:41:32,834
Now, nobody really knows
about this.

1318
01:41:32,868 --> 01:41:34,970
Theoretically, yes.

1319
01:41:35,003 --> 01:41:38,507
But it hasn't yet
been put to the real test.

1320
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:41,677
Perhaps it will
destroy all life.

1321
01:41:41,710 --> 01:41:43,212
Perhaps.

1322
01:41:43,245 --> 01:41:45,381
Certainly it could
destroy millions.

1323
01:41:46,982 --> 01:41:48,884
Do you want to test it?

1324
01:42:05,267 --> 01:42:06,768
Mr. Ainsley?
Yes.

1325
01:42:10,372 --> 01:42:12,107
I was watching for you
and saw the car stop.

1326
01:42:12,140 --> 01:42:14,109
Thought I'd better
pick you up here.

1327
01:42:14,142 --> 01:42:17,946
The engine failed.
Don't worry about it, we'll take off immediately.

1328
01:42:17,979 --> 01:42:19,381
Yes, sir.

1329
01:42:20,449 --> 01:42:22,651
Any trouble, Mr. Ainsley?
No, no.

1330
01:42:29,258 --> 01:42:30,058
Well, Mr. Barrett?

1331
01:42:30,091 --> 01:42:32,261
The flask is still in
Los Angeles.

1332
01:43:25,347 --> 01:43:27,683
Still nothing?
I'm afraid not, sir.

1333
01:43:27,716 --> 01:43:29,485
Nothing on Los Angeles,
nothing at all?

1334
01:43:29,518 --> 01:43:30,686
Nothing of any consequence.

1335
01:43:32,288 --> 01:43:33,489
Hello.

1336
01:43:33,522 --> 01:43:35,291
Only two tie-ups
to Los Angeles.

1337
01:43:35,324 --> 01:43:37,426
One of them is an office building, here.
Where?

1338
01:43:37,459 --> 01:43:39,628
Ten stories high,
we've got men going through them.

1339
01:43:39,661 --> 01:43:40,996
Starting from the top.

1340
01:43:41,029 --> 01:43:44,733
Now,
the only other thing is this little notation in red ink.

1341
01:43:44,766 --> 01:43:46,368
Glendale 73.

1342
01:43:46,402 --> 01:43:48,570
We've got men calling
on every house with 73,

1343
01:43:48,604 --> 01:43:50,506
every phone number
beginning with 73,

1344
01:43:50,539 --> 01:43:52,841
every cab, well,
you get the idea, sir.

1345
01:43:52,874 --> 01:43:54,710
Yes.

1346
01:43:54,743 --> 01:43:58,246
Veretti did that,
he was doodling while they were waiting for Hoffman.

1347
01:43:58,280 --> 01:44:00,115
Hold on, Jack,
take this.

1348
01:44:01,317 --> 01:44:03,051
Well, they found
the green car.

1349
01:44:03,084 --> 01:44:05,387
Where?
It was abandoned in front of a restaurant

1350
01:44:05,421 --> 01:44:07,689
next to a service station
near Palmdale.

1351
01:44:07,723 --> 01:44:08,857
They were both closed,

1352
01:44:08,890 --> 01:44:10,692
but a watchman in a gravel
yard across the street

1353
01:44:10,726 --> 01:44:13,662
saw the green car park
and two men get out.

1354
01:44:13,695 --> 01:44:15,864
He described
Hoffman perfectly.

1355
01:44:15,865 --> 01:44:16,697
And the other man?

1356
01:44:16,698 --> 01:44:19,100
It sounds like Barrett.

1357
01:44:19,134 --> 01:44:20,602
Well, what happened to them?

1358
01:44:20,636 --> 01:44:22,971
There were two other men
waiting in a black car.

1359
01:44:23,004 --> 01:44:24,640
They held guns
on the first two.

1360
01:44:24,673 --> 01:44:27,242
Then they got in the black car
and all four drove off.

1361
01:44:27,275 --> 01:44:28,877
Didn't the night watchman
try to stop them?

1362
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:30,111
No.

1363
01:44:30,712 --> 01:44:32,213
God!

1364
01:44:32,247 --> 01:44:34,450
There's something else.

1365
01:44:34,483 --> 01:44:36,685
The watchman said one of the
men was carrying something

1366
01:44:36,718 --> 01:44:38,854
that looked like
a small flask.

1367
01:44:41,022 --> 01:44:43,224
No license plate
on the black car?

1368
01:44:43,258 --> 01:44:45,093
Wrong angle,
couldn't see it.

1369
01:44:56,905 --> 01:44:58,173
Eric.

1370
01:45:00,809 --> 01:45:03,945
This was doodled by that maniac, Veretti.
Look at this.

1371
01:45:06,047 --> 01:45:08,083
That could be a flask.

1372
01:45:08,284 --> 01:45:09,984
It is a flask.

1373
01:45:09,985 --> 01:45:12,220
I think all these
are flasks.

1374
01:45:12,788 --> 01:45:14,990
That is something real.

1375
01:45:15,023 --> 01:45:18,494
He's unconsciously trying to
draw or doodle something.

1376
01:45:18,527 --> 01:45:22,263
What is it?

1377
01:45:22,297 --> 01:45:26,201
Those lines look like parking
dividers on a parking lot.

1378
01:45:27,836 --> 01:45:29,471
Sir, look at this.

1379
01:45:32,641 --> 01:45:34,543
A diamond?

1380
01:45:34,576 --> 01:45:36,277
A baseball diamond?

1381
01:45:40,682 --> 01:45:42,618
A baseball stadium?

1382
01:45:46,555 --> 01:45:48,023
Jack, give me that.

1383
01:45:48,056 --> 01:45:50,025
Put me on Los Angeles 47
right away.

1384
01:46:35,937 --> 01:46:40,041
Hopeless, isn't it,
Mr. Barrett? And pathetic.

1385
01:46:40,075 --> 01:46:43,144
They can't run away.
Nobody can.

1386
01:46:44,780 --> 01:46:46,482
There's plenty of time.

1387
01:47:15,276 --> 01:47:16,878
Anything?

1388
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,715
Nothing.

1389
01:47:21,349 --> 01:47:22,951
Anything over there?

1390
01:47:25,086 --> 01:47:26,755
Nothing yet.

1391
01:47:45,206 --> 01:47:46,908
Telephone for you,
Captain.

1392
01:47:50,879 --> 01:47:52,313
It's Mr. Cavanaugh.

1393
01:47:52,347 --> 01:47:53,348
Hello!

1394
01:47:53,381 --> 01:47:55,617
Yes, we're here looking.
Nothing.

1395
01:47:57,218 --> 01:47:59,287
Yes, they're looking there.

1396
01:47:59,320 --> 01:48:01,923
Of course,
we'll look in there.

1397
01:48:01,957 --> 01:48:03,191
Yeah, yeah, I know.

1398
01:48:08,997 --> 01:48:13,101
We'll be running out of land
pretty soon.

1399
01:48:13,134 --> 01:48:15,704
And time. Where is the flask,
Mr. Ainsley?

1400
01:48:15,737 --> 01:48:17,438
Don't press,
Mr. Barrett.

1401
01:49:09,891 --> 01:49:11,893
Judas H. Priest!

1402
01:49:12,794 --> 01:49:14,495
Get Olsen!

1403
01:49:14,529 --> 01:49:15,997
Olsen!

1404
01:49:16,031 --> 01:49:18,734
Fifteen, 20 degrees,
eight miles.

1405
01:49:19,935 --> 01:49:21,402
Now, here is
the helicopter, sir.

1406
01:49:21,436 --> 01:49:23,805
We've kept everything away from it.
But we think it's the one.

1407
01:49:23,839 --> 01:49:26,107
Fifteen, fifteen degrees,
four miles.

1408
01:49:27,475 --> 01:49:31,546
Here it is, sir. Here it is now.
It's a new plot.

1409
01:49:31,579 --> 01:49:32,781
No voice contact?

1410
01:49:32,814 --> 01:49:36,051
No, sir. We're on
113.6 Los Angeles radio.

1411
01:49:36,084 --> 01:49:39,454
They should be on this setting
if they're trying to contact us.

1412
01:49:55,036 --> 01:49:56,304
Hold that.

1413
01:49:58,807 --> 01:50:01,609
That cap is fulminated mercury.
So don't drop it.

1414
01:50:04,713 --> 01:50:07,315
Sometimes you're
booby trapped.

1415
01:50:07,348 --> 01:50:08,383
You cut the wires and

1416
01:50:08,416 --> 01:50:09,785
phfft.

1417
01:50:16,692 --> 01:50:18,126
Uh-huh.

1418
01:50:19,360 --> 01:50:20,762
Uh-huh.

1419
01:50:23,131 --> 01:50:24,365
That's it.

1420
01:50:27,235 --> 01:50:30,038
Now, don't anybody
move a muscle,

1421
01:50:30,071 --> 01:50:32,273
till we get this
thing collected.

1422
01:50:46,154 --> 01:50:47,923
We're heading for Catalina.

1423
01:50:47,956 --> 01:50:50,926
You don't have any intentions of going where the flask is,
do you?

1424
01:50:50,959 --> 01:50:53,394
As much as you have of
destroying Station Three.

1425
01:50:53,428 --> 01:50:55,263
That's not very clear
thinking, Ainsley.

1426
01:50:55,296 --> 01:50:57,632
If you intend to take Los Angeles,
I'll take you,

1427
01:50:57,665 --> 01:50:59,300
I've got nothing to lose.

1428
01:50:59,334 --> 01:51:00,501
Except this.

1429
01:51:01,970 --> 01:51:04,072
I see, he takes you
to a yacht,

1430
01:51:04,105 --> 01:51:07,208
and tomorrow you get on the mike
and you dictate your terms.

1431
01:51:07,242 --> 01:51:08,309
That's right.

1432
01:51:08,343 --> 01:51:11,579
You'll become everything,
everyone else, nothing!

1433
01:51:11,612 --> 01:51:13,548
And then?

1434
01:51:13,581 --> 01:51:16,752
Then, for the first time
in the world...

1435
01:51:20,055 --> 01:51:23,925
What are your plans
for the world, Ainsley?

1436
01:51:23,959 --> 01:51:25,326
War, peace,
back to the middle ages?

1437
01:51:25,360 --> 01:51:26,427
Forward to the future?

1438
01:51:26,461 --> 01:51:28,196
It doesn't make any
difference what you choose,

1439
01:51:28,229 --> 01:51:29,965
because it all means
one thing to you.

1440
01:51:29,998 --> 01:51:32,600
Power!
Power for its own sake!

1441
01:52:48,877 --> 01:52:51,146
You're a little man
again, Ainsley.

1442
01:52:51,179 --> 01:52:53,114
Where's the flask?

1443
01:52:53,849 --> 01:52:56,217
Your life for Los Angeles.

1444
01:52:56,251 --> 01:52:59,921
Oh, no. Los Angeles
will be my epitaph.

1445
01:53:07,729 --> 01:53:08,864
Los Angeles radio, come in.

1446
01:53:08,897 --> 01:53:12,200
Los Angeles radio, come in.

1447
01:53:12,233 --> 01:53:15,603
This is Williams, Lee,
we've been following you on radar scope.

1448
01:53:15,636 --> 01:53:17,839
I've got the big one,
it's safe.

1449
01:53:17,873 --> 01:53:19,340
Hoffman's over the side.

1450
01:53:19,374 --> 01:53:22,010
I can't give you any
information on the other flask.

1451
01:53:22,043 --> 01:53:23,744
We found it, Lee,
it's safe.

1452
01:53:23,778 --> 01:53:24,913
What about Ann?

1453
01:53:24,946 --> 01:53:26,047
I'm here, Lee.

1454
01:53:26,081 --> 01:53:27,148
She's here with us.

1455
01:53:27,182 --> 01:53:29,350
What was that
you said about Hoffman?

1456
01:53:29,384 --> 01:53:30,651
He jumped!

1457
01:53:30,685 --> 01:53:32,954
Oh, and tell Cavanaugh
to stop looking for Ainsley.

1458
01:53:32,988 --> 01:53:36,091
Ainsley and Hoffman
were the same man.

1459
01:53:36,124 --> 01:53:38,759
I'll be setting down at LAX.
Tell the boys to be on the lookout for me.

1460
01:53:38,793 --> 01:53:41,296
I'm a little rusty
at these things.

1461
01:53:41,329 --> 01:53:43,731
We'll meet you there, Lee.
Take it nice and easy

1462
01:53:43,764 --> 01:53:46,434
and for God's sake
make a good landing.

1463
01:53:46,467 --> 01:53:50,872
I'll put down safely
and I'll give you the flask.

1464
01:53:50,906 --> 01:53:52,673
And then we're right back
where we started.
