1
00:03:23,419 --> 00:03:25,654
Thanks. I'll see ya.
Yes, sir.

2
00:03:32,661 --> 00:03:35,631
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Raskin.

3
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,566
I see you've got
the duty again.

4
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,202
You've been
back there a week.
It comes around.

5
00:03:40,636 --> 00:03:41,804
Thanks.

6
00:03:56,385 --> 00:03:57,886
Good night,
Dr. Ostrer.

7
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,154
Good night,
Reagan.

8
00:03:59,187 --> 00:04:00,623
Oh, Reagan.

9
00:04:06,228 --> 00:04:08,397
Reagan, I've gotta
talk to you.

10
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:09,932
I've got a minute now.

11
00:04:09,965 --> 00:04:12,701
No. But I want to see you
tomorrow morning.

12
00:04:14,136 --> 00:04:16,171
I'll come by your house.
10:00?

13
00:04:16,204 --> 00:04:17,540
Fine.

14
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:26,749
What's this?
Laboratory equipment
replacements.

15
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:28,250
Well, what happened
while I was gone?

16
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:29,818
Nothing, sir.

17
00:04:30,953 --> 00:04:32,455
The Director?

18
00:04:32,488 --> 00:04:34,590
Well, you know
Dr. Baxter,
he's still...

19
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,525
Introverted.

20
00:04:36,558 --> 00:04:37,760
Yes, sir.

21
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,329
Who's left in E Lab?

22
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,699
There's six,
Dr. Baxter, Hoffman, Yang,
and three technicians.

23
00:04:43,732 --> 00:04:45,267
GUARD: Correct.

24
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,603
Gonna get these inside?
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:58,814 --> 00:05:00,282
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mason.

26
00:05:00,315 --> 00:05:01,717
Who's left in there?

27
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:05,388
Six, sir. Dr. Baxter,
Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Yang,
and three technicians.

28
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,710
Dr. Hoffman.

29
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:29,311
Good evening, Reagan.

30
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:31,580
Is the Director in there?
Yes.

31
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,783
Working late tonight?

32
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:36,318
No.

33
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:52,868
Well, how was it
on the Potomac?

34
00:05:54,002 --> 00:05:57,473
Not quiet.

35
00:05:57,506 --> 00:06:01,176
I... I understand
the man has given us
a new administrator,

36
00:06:01,209 --> 00:06:03,679
Dr. Leonard Michaelson?

37
00:06:04,547 --> 00:06:06,048
Who told you that?

38
00:06:08,216 --> 00:06:09,818
Dr. Hoffman.

39
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,790
The cleaning woman told him.

40
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,092
Not funny.

41
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,394
Well, it's Friday.

42
00:06:19,428 --> 00:06:21,464
Good night, Reagan.
See you Monday.

43
00:06:21,497 --> 00:06:22,831
Good night, Doctor.

44
00:06:33,842 --> 00:06:36,745
Any trouble?
No, sir. Just some
minor residuals.

45
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:38,814
There's a couple of
crates outside.
Let's get 'em in.

46
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,082
Yes, sir.
Raskin just called.

47
00:07:00,302 --> 00:07:01,904
Good evening, Doctor.

48
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,506
Oh.

49
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:05,974
What is it, Reagan?

50
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:09,512
Working late?

51
00:07:09,545 --> 00:07:12,815
No. But I'll be
in tomorrow.

52
00:07:12,848 --> 00:07:14,683
What time?
8:00.

53
00:07:16,151 --> 00:07:18,186
I'll set the time lock
for you.

54
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,523
Last time you
locked yourself out
until Monday.

55
00:07:20,556 --> 00:07:21,824
I know.

56
00:07:23,158 --> 00:07:24,860
You've been away,
haven't you?

57
00:07:24,893 --> 00:07:26,328
Washington.

58
00:07:27,395 --> 00:07:30,098
How worried are they?

59
00:07:30,132 --> 00:07:33,769
Well, they're always
worried about the security
of this place.

60
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:35,604
My job's like that.

61
00:07:36,805 --> 00:07:39,174
What they're really
worried about is that.

62
00:07:39,207 --> 00:07:40,876
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:45,113
Did you, uh,
reassure them?

64
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,616
No. I leave that to you.

65
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:49,317
Yes.

66
00:07:52,755 --> 00:07:55,423
Sir, do you think...

67
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:58,794
Why don't you
take this Saturday
and Sunday off, Doctor?

68
00:07:58,827 --> 00:08:00,395
Do you good.

69
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:02,998
No time for that, Reagan.

70
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:04,933
No time.

71
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:09,938
Tired men
make mistakes, Doctor.

72
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:13,208
God help us
if a mistake's made here.

73
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,782
Goodnight, Doctor.

74
00:08:24,152 --> 00:08:25,353
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

75
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,590
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

76
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:39,400
Good night, Mason.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.

77
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:04,126
Good night,
Dr. Hoffman.

78
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:18,807
You are leaving, Doctor?

79
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,143
I'll be a few minutes.

80
00:09:23,712 --> 00:09:25,948
Do you need me
for anything?

81
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,182
No.

82
00:09:27,983 --> 00:09:29,752
Good night, Hoffman.

83
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,461
(SIGHING)

84
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,767
Goodnight, Dr. Hoffman.
Goodnight, Mason.

85
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:06,789
Good night, Doctor.

86
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,995
Good night, Doctor.

87
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:05,047
(AIR LOCK WHIRRING)

88
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,909
(PHONE RINGING)

89
00:11:34,977 --> 00:11:36,344
Mason speaking.

90
00:11:37,512 --> 00:11:38,947
Is Doctor Williams in?

91
00:11:38,981 --> 00:11:41,216
MASON: Dr. Williams
is not in E Lab.

92
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,719
Good night,
Dr. Baxter.

93
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:47,756
Two sixteen.
That's administration.

94
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,792
You're welcome.

95
00:12:09,644 --> 00:12:12,280
It's Mason.
E Lab clear and closed.

96
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:14,216
Right.

97
00:12:23,591 --> 00:12:25,828
Good night,
Doctor Baxter.

98
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:33,468
Good night, Doctor.

99
00:12:55,824 --> 00:12:57,059
Raskin.

100
00:12:58,026 --> 00:12:59,161
Yes, sir.

101
00:12:59,194 --> 00:13:01,563
Reagan.
I'm going into E Lab.

102
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,176
The shoulder on
that back road's caved in.

103
00:14:21,209 --> 00:14:23,946
We ought to
take care of that tomorrow.
All right.

104
00:14:23,979 --> 00:14:26,648
Might as well make
a note of it in the log
for Mr. Reagan in the morning.

105
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:28,416
I'll tell him
when he leaves.

106
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,386
He's still here?
Mmm-hmm. E Lab.

107
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:35,690
What time
did he go in there?

108
00:14:43,665 --> 00:14:45,267
Mr. Reagan.

109
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:49,972
Mr. Reagan.

110
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:55,577
RASKIN ON PA:
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

111
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,914
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

112
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,124
Get over there
and check that
security door.

113
00:15:17,565 --> 00:15:20,868
This is Lieutenant Raskin,
Duty Officer, Station Three.

114
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:25,407
Get me the Director,
Dr. Baxter, at home,
or Mr. Tasserly. Right.

115
00:15:26,408 --> 00:15:28,876
(BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC)

116
00:15:49,731 --> 00:15:51,566
There's a phone call for you.
What?

117
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:52,867
There's a phone call for you.

118
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,536
Thank you, very much.

119
00:16:10,818 --> 00:16:13,721
Hello. Who?

120
00:16:15,457 --> 00:16:20,062
Okay, put him on.
Yes. Mr. Martin?

121
00:16:20,095 --> 00:16:22,997
Well, I could, but I don't
particularly want to.

122
00:16:24,132 --> 00:16:27,269
Yeah. All right.
I hope it's as vital to me.

123
00:17:06,473 --> 00:17:08,076
Mr. Martin?
Yes.

124
00:17:09,911 --> 00:17:11,413
Good evening.

125
00:17:11,445 --> 00:17:13,647
Good of you to see me
at such a late hour,
Mr. Barrett.

126
00:17:13,681 --> 00:17:16,483
You didn't care
for a drink?
Oh, no, thank you.

127
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:19,487
Do you live aboard
all the time, Mr. Barrett?

128
00:17:19,521 --> 00:17:21,189
No, just some of the time.

129
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:25,492
I don't imagine
your law practice is
too demanding these days.

130
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:27,529
Could be better.

131
00:17:27,561 --> 00:17:30,898
Yet, you can
afford this yacht.
Must be rather expensive.

132
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,902
What can I do for you,
Mr. Martin?

133
00:17:36,104 --> 00:17:38,973
We have a job for you.
We think you're the right man.

134
00:17:39,006 --> 00:17:41,209
Oh? Why?

135
00:17:41,243 --> 00:17:43,378
You have the background
for it.

136
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:47,915
And in the past,
you've been quite outspoken
on the immorality of war.

137
00:17:47,949 --> 00:17:49,984
Everybody says
he's against war.

138
00:17:50,017 --> 00:17:53,955
Not ex-United States
Intelligence Officers.

139
00:17:53,988 --> 00:17:56,958
Let's take a look
at some of the record.

140
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,695
"Lee Barrett.
1950. University student.
Pre law."

141
00:18:00,728 --> 00:18:02,597
"Then active service,
Korea and helicopters."

142
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:05,300
"Detached for special service.
Excellent war record."

143
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:09,070
"Citation.
Superb lone operator
who has no master in cunning,"

144
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,805
"secrecy or violence."

145
00:18:10,838 --> 00:18:14,709
"Promoted to captain.
Recommended for
three decorations."

146
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,711
First discordant note.
Last two refused.

147
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:20,582
You are quoted
as saying that war

148
00:18:20,615 --> 00:18:24,586
"had aged you so fast,
you were too old
to play with toys."

149
00:18:26,388 --> 00:18:28,390
Rather a whimsical statement,
Mr. Barrett.

150
00:18:28,423 --> 00:18:30,091
You think so?

151
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:32,294
Why did you
leave the service?

152
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,728
Poor prospects.

153
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:38,500
Discharged, 1952.

154
00:18:38,533 --> 00:18:43,271
Allowed to resign commission
after altercation with
a Major General.

155
00:18:43,305 --> 00:18:45,440
Some people
have flat feet.

156
00:18:45,473 --> 00:18:48,876
I dislike taking orders
under certain circumstances.

157
00:18:50,912 --> 00:18:55,317
Then you got your law degree.
Passed the bar examination,
but didn't practice.

158
00:18:55,850 --> 00:18:57,652
Joined a government agency.

159
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,321
Fired.

160
00:18:59,354 --> 00:19:03,358
A stint with another one.
Fired for the usual reason.

161
00:19:03,391 --> 00:19:05,960
You rate rather high
on insubordination.

162
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:08,996
My record is easy to check,
Mr. Martin. Make your point.

163
00:19:10,632 --> 00:19:14,068
A year ago you were
appointed Security Chief
at Station Three.

164
00:19:14,101 --> 00:19:16,371
How do you know
about Station Three?

165
00:19:16,404 --> 00:19:20,141
The most secret
chemical warfare establishment
in this hemisphere.

166
00:19:21,809 --> 00:19:23,978
Fired three months ago.

167
00:19:24,011 --> 00:19:29,116
Reason? "Emotional rejection
of purpose of project."

168
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,921
"Council for World Peace."

169
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,957
"Henry Martin,
Executive Secretary."

170
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:37,191
You heard of us?

171
00:19:37,225 --> 00:19:38,526
Oh, yes.

172
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,528
MARTIN ON RADIO:
But you don't approve of us?

173
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:43,064
BARRETT: I don't like
semi-secret organizations,
Mr. Martin.

174
00:19:43,097 --> 00:19:44,966
Neither do I,
Mr. Barrett.

175
00:19:44,999 --> 00:19:48,135
But the Council is
a potent weapon for peace.

176
00:19:48,169 --> 00:19:51,673
We're not communistic
or anti-communistic.

177
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,876
You just want
a workable peace.

178
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:57,679
Like you, perhaps,
Mr. Barrett.

179
00:19:57,712 --> 00:20:01,616
You have been outspoken
on the foolishness of war.

180
00:20:05,086 --> 00:20:07,789
That was removed
from Station Three
a few hours ago.

181
00:20:07,822 --> 00:20:10,658
It doesn't matter
how at the moment.

182
00:20:10,692 --> 00:20:12,860
Do you know
what it is?

183
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:17,299
Botulinus?

184
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:19,066
No.

185
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,803
A vaccine
against botulinus.

186
00:20:23,505 --> 00:20:27,208
The contents of
that flask can be cultured
to provide enough vaccine

187
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:29,477
to immunize
any nation on Earth.

188
00:20:30,845 --> 00:20:33,448
We want it delivered
to this address.

189
00:20:37,385 --> 00:20:39,554
Europe?
Yes.

190
00:20:39,587 --> 00:20:42,023
How does that help peace?

191
00:20:42,056 --> 00:20:45,393
It neutralizes
a terrible weapon.

192
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:49,764
If we both have it, well,
neither side can threaten
the other with it.

193
00:20:51,466 --> 00:20:53,935
Very dangerous assignment,
Mr. Martin.

194
00:20:56,404 --> 00:21:01,108
$10,000 should cover
your expenses.

195
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,579
I'm afraid not.

196
00:21:04,612 --> 00:21:05,947
Then you refuse?

197
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:07,482
No.

198
00:21:07,515 --> 00:21:13,287
It'll cost you 20,000.
10,000 each way. Cash. Now.

199
00:21:13,321 --> 00:21:15,390
You mind if I say something,
Mr. Barrett?

200
00:21:15,423 --> 00:21:16,891
Yes, I do.

201
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:18,192
Keep your speeches
and moralities
for your council.

202
00:21:18,225 --> 00:21:19,361
This is a business deal.

203
00:21:19,394 --> 00:21:22,364
No wonder you were
thrown out of
so many places.

204
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:25,166
Satisfied?

205
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:26,334
Yes.

206
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:30,338
Put your forearms
on the table.

207
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,107
You have a strange way
of doing business,
Mr. Barrett.

208
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,742
What is this?
A holdup?

209
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,844
Put your forearms
on the table.

210
00:21:38,646 --> 00:21:40,815
First, vaccines
are not stored
at Station Three.

211
00:21:40,848 --> 00:21:43,150
So this has got to be
some kind of a virus.

212
00:21:43,184 --> 00:21:46,187
Second, no one's
supposed to know anything
about Station Three.

213
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,124
And third,
I know quite a bit about
the World Peace Organization.

214
00:21:50,157 --> 00:21:53,695
There's a fat, balding man
who is the secretary,
name, Henry Martin.

215
00:21:53,728 --> 00:21:55,397
I know him.

216
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,198
What do you
intend to do?

217
00:21:57,231 --> 00:21:59,867
Turn you over
to the right people.

218
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:03,037
I know this isn't evidence,

219
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:07,308
but with your fingerprints
on the flask, and the money,
it'll do.

220
00:22:07,341 --> 00:22:08,910
MARTIN: I guess
I underestimated you.

221
00:22:08,943 --> 00:22:10,678
I guess you did.
Now, stand up.

222
00:22:10,712 --> 00:22:13,981
Turn around, put your hands on
the bulkhead and lean on them.

223
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:31,599
(FOOTSTEPS)

224
00:22:38,239 --> 00:22:39,741
Cavanaugh? What the hell
are you doing here?

225
00:22:39,774 --> 00:22:41,776
Now, don't get sore, Barrett.
I had to do this in a hurry,

226
00:22:41,809 --> 00:22:43,177
and it's the only way
I could handle it.

227
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,178
Handle what?

228
00:22:44,211 --> 00:22:46,981
I had to check you
for security and quick.

229
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:51,486
That character's
one of your agents?
That's right.

230
00:22:51,519 --> 00:22:53,955
And you planned this
whole thing just to see
if I could be bought?

231
00:22:53,988 --> 00:22:55,957
You could put it
that way, I guess.

232
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:58,092
I didn't know what kind of
a security risk you'd become.

233
00:22:58,125 --> 00:22:59,627
People change, you know.

234
00:22:59,661 --> 00:23:03,097
You did have me worried
on that radio there
for a moment.

235
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,232
Get out of here
and get your tail back
to Washington.

236
00:23:05,266 --> 00:23:06,868
Mr. Barrett,
I'm Dr. Leonard Michaelson.

237
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:09,103
I know who you are.
You, too. Get out.

238
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:11,673
Get your props
and get off this boat.

239
00:23:11,706 --> 00:23:14,509
Barrett, you know the way
our security agency works.

240
00:23:14,542 --> 00:23:16,878
Mr. Barrett, I can understand
how you might interpret this

241
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:19,213
as a reflection
on your loyalty...
Sir.

242
00:23:19,246 --> 00:23:22,183
Barrett, the General has asked
that we come to you.

243
00:23:23,785 --> 00:23:25,453
He wants you
in on this.

244
00:23:26,554 --> 00:23:28,189
In on what?

245
00:23:28,222 --> 00:23:31,325
Station Three was broken into
a few hours ago.

246
00:23:31,358 --> 00:23:34,596
Reagan's been murdered
and Dr. Baxter has vanished.

247
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:00,588
Mr. Michaelson?
Right.

248
00:24:00,622 --> 00:24:03,357
I'm Pelton Tasserly,
Deputy Administrator here.
Mr. Tasserly.

249
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,059
Lieutenant Raskin.
Lieutenant Johnson.

250
00:24:05,092 --> 00:24:06,928
Good morning.
I'm very sorry
about this, sir.

251
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,295
No sooner take over and...
Yes, yes, Tasserly.

252
00:24:08,329 --> 00:24:10,431
You know Mr. Cavanaugh?
Yes, I do.

253
00:24:10,464 --> 00:24:13,167
Mr. Barrett?
Hello, Barrett.

254
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,435
Anything on Baxter?

255
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:16,738
Nothing. But the net's out.
All points.

256
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:18,005
What steps have you taken?

257
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,841
None, really. I figured
you'd get here pretty fast.

258
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:22,043
So I've touched nothing,
talked to no one.

259
00:24:22,076 --> 00:24:24,679
I did bring in
all the security people
who were on duty last night.

260
00:24:24,712 --> 00:24:27,114
Whom have you
told about this,
Mr. Tasserly?

261
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:29,016
Well, no one,
other than you people,

262
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,484
and our security men,
of course.

263
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:32,987
And Doctor Hoffman.
Why him?

264
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:35,089
Well, he was the last one out,
except for the Director.

265
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,958
He's waiting
in E block now.

266
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:38,860
Let's take
a look at Reagan.

267
00:24:47,669 --> 00:24:49,403
Are you with us,
Barrett?

268
00:24:49,436 --> 00:24:51,105
I'll be there
in a minute.

269
00:24:57,411 --> 00:24:59,681
How do you see this,
Johnson?

270
00:24:59,714 --> 00:25:04,986
Well, Mr. Tasserly says,
and Mason swears that
nobody got into E Lab.

271
00:25:05,019 --> 00:25:07,288
But I don't think Reagan
committed suicide in there.

272
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:09,724
Neither do I.
What's the sentry dog
doing over here?

273
00:25:09,757 --> 00:25:12,126
He's got a lump on his head
that wasn't there yesterday.

274
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:15,597
But he was still on patrol
this morning?
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:18,600
I think maybe
he might've been
knocked cold for awhile.

276
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:21,669
Of course, being a dog,
he couldn't tell me about it.
He just went back to work.

277
00:25:21,703 --> 00:25:23,270
Yeah.

278
00:25:23,304 --> 00:25:25,072
Has Raskin got men
going over the fence?

279
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,574
Every inch.

280
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:40,054
Right in that corner, sir.

281
00:25:51,198 --> 00:25:54,669
Dr. Hoffman's
terribly distraught.
Insists he must talk to you.

282
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:56,270
Immediately, in private.

283
00:25:56,303 --> 00:25:58,072
Perhaps you should
see him, sir.

284
00:25:58,105 --> 00:25:59,406
Hmm.

285
00:26:02,409 --> 00:26:04,712
Dr. Hoffman,
this is Dr. Michaelson.

286
00:26:19,493 --> 00:26:20,695
How was it done?

287
00:26:20,728 --> 00:26:22,529
Blow on the head.
No weapon.

288
00:26:23,831 --> 00:26:25,132
Who set the time lock?

289
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,468
I don't know, sir.
I suppose Dr. Baxter.

290
00:26:27,501 --> 00:26:29,570
Another half an hour to go.

291
00:26:29,603 --> 00:26:31,172
Is there any way
to work that combination

292
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:33,140
and go in before
the time is up?

293
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,009
We've got to find out
if anything has
happened in there.

294
00:26:35,042 --> 00:26:38,079
No way on earth
until those red lights
go off at 8:00.

295
00:26:38,112 --> 00:26:41,148
You fool with that
door before that,
well, you'd die quick.

296
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,318
It's booby trapped.
A thousand volt charge
and lethal gas.

297
00:26:44,351 --> 00:26:46,053
JOHNSON ON PA: Mr. Raskin.
Yes?

298
00:26:46,087 --> 00:26:47,588
We've found
a break in the fence.

299
00:26:47,621 --> 00:26:49,724
Don't touch it.
We'll be right there.
Yes, sir.

300
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:51,492
CAVANAUGH: Raskin,
have your men
move Reagan's body

301
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:52,794
to one of
the side laboratories.

302
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,128
RASKIN: Yes, sir.

303
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,768
CAVANAUGH: Taped.

304
00:27:00,802 --> 00:27:02,603
So that you
can't even see it
unless you look closely.

305
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,272
Very careful job.

306
00:27:05,306 --> 00:27:07,208
Raskin, open
the other side.

307
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:12,246
Cut left to right.
A right-handed man, maybe.

308
00:27:12,279 --> 00:27:16,017
Or a left-handed man
who wants us to think
he's right-handed, maybe.

309
00:27:22,556 --> 00:27:25,559
The alarm didn't go off.
The wire hasn't been
touched anywhere.

310
00:27:25,592 --> 00:27:27,428
Someone'd really have to know
their way around this place

311
00:27:27,461 --> 00:27:29,463
not to trip over this
at night.

312
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:31,265
RASKIN: The thing
I don't understand,

313
00:27:31,298 --> 00:27:33,434
is how anybody
can get past the dog.

314
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,869
I don't get that, either.

315
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:37,104
What do you
think happened?

316
00:27:37,138 --> 00:27:38,272
I don't know, sir.

317
00:27:38,305 --> 00:27:39,741
BARRETT: What's his name?
Rollo.

318
00:27:39,774 --> 00:27:42,944
Can I handle him?
He's under sedation.
Go ahead.

319
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:49,116
Easy, Rollo.
Easy, boy.
Easy, Rollo.

320
00:27:49,717 --> 00:27:51,685
Easy. Easy.

321
00:27:51,719 --> 00:27:53,154
(WHIMPERING)

322
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:53,888
There it is.

323
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,723
What do you
make of that?

324
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:56,958
Hmm.

325
00:28:00,027 --> 00:28:02,563
Those are cuts.
How'd they get there?

326
00:28:02,596 --> 00:28:03,831
CAVANAUGH: From the wire.

327
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:04,899
Right.

328
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,135
Raskin, you be Rollo.

329
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,474
Now, you tape up your arm,
stick it through, thus...

330
00:28:13,507 --> 00:28:15,142
Okay, grab it.

331
00:28:16,443 --> 00:28:18,512
You hang up Rollo
on the wires
so he can't pull free

332
00:28:18,545 --> 00:28:19,981
without tearing
his throat out.

333
00:28:20,014 --> 00:28:22,316
CAVANAUGH: He'd make a noise.
No. These dogs are trained
not to bark.

334
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:23,317
No matter what. Right?
JOHNSON: Right.

335
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:25,419
Then you clobber him
with something heavy,

336
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:28,089
you tape up the wire
and you're gone.

337
00:28:28,122 --> 00:28:30,758
When Rollo comes to,
he's got the world's
most massive headache.

338
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,060
But being a dog,
he can't tell anybody

339
00:28:33,094 --> 00:28:35,362
so he just goes
back to work. Simple.

340
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:37,331
So that's how he got in.

341
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:39,500
BARRETT: No.
That's how he got out.
Out?

342
00:28:39,533 --> 00:28:41,302
Right. Look at the ends
of these wires
where they're bent.

343
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:43,470
He took Rollo
from the inside.

344
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:49,010
Mr. Barrett,
a telegram for you.
It came to our office in town.

345
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:51,012
How come you get
a telegram here?

346
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:52,046
Magic.

347
00:28:54,782 --> 00:28:56,784
I'd certainly like to know
what it says.

348
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:58,319
I'll bet you would.

349
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:00,955
Mr. Cavanaugh,
it's 10 minutes to 8:00.

350
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:05,793
I know it is
an outside possibility,

351
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:08,462
but it is a possibility
and a horrible one.

352
00:29:08,495 --> 00:29:12,299
And you cannot just
kick it under the rug.
You have not the right...

353
00:29:15,269 --> 00:29:17,438
CAVANAUGH: What is it?

354
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:20,474
We have a very difficult
situation here.

355
00:29:20,507 --> 00:29:23,377
Dr. Hoffman feels
that E Lab should be
sealed in concrete.

356
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,711
Why?

357
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:27,414
Because he's afraid
that some chemicals
in that vault

358
00:29:27,448 --> 00:29:29,150
may have been
broken or tampered with.

359
00:29:29,183 --> 00:29:31,919
Even if they weren't,
we still cannot
take the chance.

360
00:29:31,953 --> 00:29:35,056
The possibilities are
too monstrous to gamble with.

361
00:29:35,089 --> 00:29:37,191
What possibilities?

362
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,163
I think you better
tell them, Doctor.

363
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:44,966
(SIGHING)

364
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:50,337
More than 40
bio-chemical weapons have been
developed at Station Three.

365
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,508
I will confine myself
to two which we have
developed here in E Lab.

366
00:29:54,942 --> 00:29:57,411
First, botulinus.

367
00:29:57,444 --> 00:30:01,015
We have 1,200 grams
in six flasks.

368
00:30:01,048 --> 00:30:04,018
If 10 grams of it
were allowed to
contaminate a city,

369
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,153
that city is a morgue
in four hours.

370
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:12,593
It is an ideal weapon,
God forgive the phrase,

371
00:30:12,626 --> 00:30:15,696
because it destroys
only people.

372
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:21,635
And it oxidizes itself.
In effect, dies, disappears
after eight hours.

373
00:30:21,668 --> 00:30:23,137
Well, then,
it's safe to go in there.

374
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:26,073
It's been over eight hours
since that vault door
was closed.

375
00:30:26,107 --> 00:30:28,775
And if all 1,200 grams of
the botulinus were spilled
on the floor,

376
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:31,312
it would still be safe.

377
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:35,116
The closed air circulating
system is still in operation.
So it would be oxidized.

378
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:39,820
That is correct. But there is
something else in there.

379
00:30:39,853 --> 00:30:44,625
It is only three weeks
since Dr. Baxter refined it
and only three days

380
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:47,995
since he communicated
its existence to anyone.

381
00:30:48,029 --> 00:30:50,864
There's something beyond
the botulinus?

382
00:30:50,898 --> 00:30:53,634
Yes, the second weapon.

383
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:56,270
Also a virus, air borne.

384
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:59,773
But self-perpetuating.
Indestructible.

385
00:30:59,806 --> 00:31:04,045
Once released, it will
multiply at a power
beyond our calculations.

386
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:07,114
It perhaps, will never die.

387
00:31:07,148 --> 00:31:10,851
To this virus, we have given
a highly unscientific name,

388
00:31:10,884 --> 00:31:14,255
but one which
describes it perfectly.

389
00:31:14,288 --> 00:31:16,090
The Satan Bug.

390
00:31:17,491 --> 00:31:21,195
If I took the flask
which contains it
and exposed it to the air,

391
00:31:21,228 --> 00:31:23,965
everyone here
would be dead
in a few seconds.

392
00:31:23,998 --> 00:31:27,001
California would be a tomb
in a few hours.

393
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:29,536
In a week,

394
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:32,706
all life,
and I mean all life,

395
00:31:32,739 --> 00:31:35,776
would cease
in the United States.

396
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,845
In two months,
two months at the most,

397
00:31:38,879 --> 00:31:42,083
the trapper in Alaska,
the peasant on the Yangtze,

398
00:31:42,116 --> 00:31:44,151
the aborigine in Australia,
dead.

399
00:31:44,751 --> 00:31:46,287
All dead.

400
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,059
Because I crushed the flask
and exposed a green
colored liquid to the air.

401
00:31:52,093 --> 00:31:55,329
Nothing, nothing can stop
the Satan Bug.

402
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:58,299
What would be
the last to go?

403
00:31:58,332 --> 00:32:03,037
Perhaps a great albatross
winging it's way around
the bottom of the world.

404
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,439
Perhaps an Eskimo
deep in the Arctic.

405
00:32:05,472 --> 00:32:11,178
But the seas travel
the world over
and so do the winds.

406
00:32:11,212 --> 00:32:14,681
One day, one day soon,
they, too, would die.

407
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:18,019
The Satan Bug is
behind that door.

408
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:22,056
One flask.
It has got to be locked up.
It has got to be.

409
00:32:22,089 --> 00:32:24,258
I must make you understand.

410
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:26,660
If botulinus is spilled,
as Mr. Barrett here
has just said,

411
00:32:26,693 --> 00:32:28,695
then it does not matter.

412
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:31,898
But, by God,
if someone did
get in there,

413
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:35,236
and the Satan Bug is spilled,
and the vault door
opened half an inch

414
00:32:35,269 --> 00:32:38,972
and left open,
then the airlock room
is lethal.

415
00:32:39,006 --> 00:32:42,143
Open this door for more than
five seconds

416
00:32:42,176 --> 00:32:46,513
and everything
that I have told you
will happen, will happen.

417
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,750
I beg you, sir,
seal up the door.
You cannot take the risk.

418
00:32:52,353 --> 00:32:55,089
I agree. There's
nothing else we can do.

419
00:32:55,122 --> 00:32:56,423
We've no option.

420
00:32:56,457 --> 00:32:59,960
We've no option,
but to make sure
it's in there and untouched.

421
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:03,397
(SQUEAKING)

422
00:33:05,899 --> 00:33:07,501
All right,
you're all set.

423
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:17,411
Barrett,
if that hamster does die,
you'll be contaminated.

424
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:20,581
You won't be able
to come out of there.

425
00:33:20,614 --> 00:33:21,582
I know.

426
00:33:21,615 --> 00:33:22,683
Well, I trust your intentions,

427
00:33:22,716 --> 00:33:25,752
but if there is
something wrong in there, I...

428
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:28,789
You wonder if I can
go through staying in there?

429
00:33:28,822 --> 00:33:30,724
Yes.
So do I.

430
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:34,095
Eric, do you have your gun?

431
00:33:34,128 --> 00:33:36,797
If I come out of that vault
with this face mask down,

432
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:39,766
open that airlock door
just a crack and use it.

433
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,268
It's below atmospheric
pressure in there,

434
00:33:41,302 --> 00:33:43,604
so the outside air
will rush in.

435
00:33:43,637 --> 00:33:48,075
You'll have time.
You'll be safe.

436
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,644
Lee, you know
if I have to,
I will use this.

437
00:33:51,345 --> 00:33:52,446
I know.

438
00:34:14,768 --> 00:34:17,371
(AIR LOCK WHIRRING)

439
00:35:32,746 --> 00:35:34,481
(SQUEAKING)

440
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:53,967
(SQUEAKING)

441
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:45,486
There's no danger.

442
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,988
Baxter's in there.
He's dead.

443
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,230
(SQUEAKING)

444
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:15,048
Botulinus.

445
00:37:15,081 --> 00:37:18,118
There was
a accident last month,
a technician.

446
00:37:18,151 --> 00:37:19,386
Oh, no, it is all right.

447
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:22,489
There's just the odor now.
It's oxidized.

448
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,692
What about
the Satan Bug, Dr. Hoffman?

449
00:37:29,896 --> 00:37:33,434
Don't touch
the handle, Doctor.
We need fingerprints.

450
00:37:45,111 --> 00:37:46,547
It is gone.

451
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:49,282
And the botulinus.

452
00:37:49,316 --> 00:37:53,554
All the flasks.
Yes. They are all gone.

453
00:37:53,587 --> 00:37:57,691
It can't be gone.
It can't be.
It's impossible.

454
00:37:57,724 --> 00:37:59,393
Baxter walked out
last night.

455
00:37:59,426 --> 00:38:00,761
He was checked out. He was!

456
00:38:00,794 --> 00:38:02,329
BARRETT: Somebody else
walked out.

457
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:39,666
Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm Lee Barrett.

458
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:42,503
Oh, yes, Mr. Barrett.
You're in suite 15.

459
00:38:43,704 --> 00:38:45,372
I am?
Yes, sir.

460
00:38:46,873 --> 00:38:49,242
You're already registered.

461
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:50,777
I am?
You certainly are.

462
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:52,779
Hello, Lee, darling.

463
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,553
Thank you, very much.

464
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:00,921
Don't mention it.

465
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:04,658
I thought you'd
never get here.

466
00:39:04,691 --> 00:39:07,794
I've read the newspaper
three times and had
four cups of coffee.

467
00:39:07,828 --> 00:39:09,195
Well, I hope
you saved one for me.

468
00:39:09,229 --> 00:39:10,664
I certainly did.

469
00:39:17,203 --> 00:39:19,406
What the hell
are you doing here?

470
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,775
I'm using a new strategy,
darling.

471
00:39:21,808 --> 00:39:25,311
I thought you might like
the Mata Hari type.

472
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:27,548
But that telegram,
"The sooner the better."

473
00:39:27,581 --> 00:39:30,016
Can you think of a better way
to get you here fast?

474
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,918
At least you
could've signed it, damn it.

475
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,988
Hey, your language
hasn't improved a bit,
by the way.

476
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:37,991
You need a wife's influence.

477
00:39:38,024 --> 00:39:40,193
Ann, honey,
what are you doing here?

478
00:39:40,226 --> 00:39:42,829
Isn't this a beautiful part
of the desert?

479
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:45,566
It's marvelous,
almost a hideaway.

480
00:39:46,166 --> 00:39:47,233
Where is he?

481
00:39:47,267 --> 00:39:49,335
About 10 miles from here.

482
00:39:49,369 --> 00:39:51,404
Well, who's the cover
this time?

483
00:39:51,705 --> 00:39:53,273
Me.

484
00:39:53,306 --> 00:39:54,941
You?

485
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,177
You know, you're not
very bright this morning,
Lee, darling

486
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:59,312
and you're certainly not
a bit flattering.

487
00:39:59,345 --> 00:40:02,616
You and I are spending
a quiet little weekend here.

488
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:05,018
Supposedly.

489
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,787
Oh.

490
00:40:07,921 --> 00:40:09,656
What is it this time, Lee?

491
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:12,425
It's not good.

492
00:40:12,459 --> 00:40:13,827
Why didn't you say so?

493
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:16,396
I know a darling place
out in the desert for lunch.

494
00:40:16,429 --> 00:40:19,600
Green pepper burritos
and cold Mexican beer.

495
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:20,801
Ole.

496
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,503
Oh, hello, Ann, darling.
Good morning, Dad.

497
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,938
Good morning, sir.
Good to see you again.

498
00:40:57,971 --> 00:40:59,806
Hello, Lee.
It's good to see you.
Sit down.

499
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,208
Thank you.
That's it for
romance today, Lee.

500
00:41:02,242 --> 00:41:03,577
I'll get your breakfast.
No, that can wait.

501
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:06,079
Sit down, Ann.
There's no reason
why you shouldn't hear this.

502
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:08,014
It didn't take you
long to get here
from Washington.

503
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:11,585
No. I'm a member of
the Mach two club now.
A little over two hours.

504
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:15,488
No, Ann came ahead of me.
I was going to talk to Baxter.

505
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:17,658
We've just learned
of the Satan Bug.

506
00:41:17,691 --> 00:41:19,760
Baxter hadn't told you?

507
00:41:19,793 --> 00:41:23,530
No, not until three days ago.
He was quite disturbed.

508
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:26,667
So were all of us.
A difficult decision.

509
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,603
Didn't know what to do.
Destroy it or not.

510
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:34,941
Is it gone?
Yes, sir.
And all the botulinus.

511
00:41:37,177 --> 00:41:38,612
And I warned him.

512
00:41:38,645 --> 00:41:41,648
You set a project
like this in motion,
something has to blow.

513
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:42,949
You think Baxter took it?

514
00:41:42,983 --> 00:41:45,586
No, I found him in the lab.
He's dead.

515
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:47,854
Baxter's dead?

516
00:41:47,888 --> 00:41:49,756
Somehow two men
got into E Lab yesterday.

517
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:52,826
They must've found
Baxter there alone,
just before closing.

518
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:54,995
One of them
threw the flask at him
and then shut the vault door,

519
00:41:55,028 --> 00:41:57,063
then he walked out
as Baxter.

520
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,364
As Baxter?
There must've been

521
00:41:58,398 --> 00:42:01,568
a reasonable resemblance,
and with Baxter's hat
and coat,

522
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,236
everybody expected
to see Baxter.

523
00:42:03,269 --> 00:42:04,304
So they saw Baxter.

524
00:42:04,337 --> 00:42:05,739
And?

525
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:08,174
The other man
went through the fence
with the stuff.

526
00:42:08,208 --> 00:42:11,011
Reagan must've stumbled
on them in the lab.

527
00:42:14,514 --> 00:42:16,950
Does Cavanaugh
have any ideas?

528
00:42:16,983 --> 00:42:18,218
None. But he's
all over the place

529
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:20,120
with fingerprint men
and cameras.

530
00:42:20,153 --> 00:42:22,823
He'll interrogate everything,
everybody, but he won't
come up with anything

531
00:42:22,856 --> 00:42:24,591
that will be of any value.

532
00:42:25,491 --> 00:42:27,761
You agree
that it was an inside job?

533
00:42:27,794 --> 00:42:30,096
Certainly an inside assist,
but too smooth to be caught

534
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,665
by fingerprints
and conversation.

535
00:42:31,698 --> 00:42:33,566
Anyhow, sir, as you know,

536
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,637
the "how" is not important,
it's the "who"
and the "why" that counts.

537
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,638
Yes.

538
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,073
Lee,

539
00:42:40,106 --> 00:42:43,176
have they told you
just what this
new virus will do?

540
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:44,911
Dr. Hoffman filled me in.

541
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:50,250
It's throwing that botulinus
that worries me.

542
00:42:50,283 --> 00:42:51,752
That's the work
of a lunatic.

543
00:42:51,785 --> 00:42:52,953
There're three
possibilities.

544
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:54,855
Foreign power, possible.

545
00:42:54,888 --> 00:42:57,157
Criminals, hijackers,
improbable.

546
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:59,092
It's the first
and the third
that bother me.

547
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:01,494
What's the third?
Well, you said it,
a lunatic.

548
00:43:01,527 --> 00:43:04,364
Well, psychotics
don't generally engage
in team work like this.

549
00:43:04,397 --> 00:43:07,233
Paranoids do,
and they're very brilliant,
some of them.

550
00:43:07,267 --> 00:43:08,969
What sort of paranoid?

551
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:11,137
The kind that we grow
the most of in this country.

552
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,438
A messiah.

553
00:43:12,472 --> 00:43:14,107
What kind of messiah?

554
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,475
Take your pick.

555
00:43:15,508 --> 00:43:17,944
Extreme right,
extreme left.

556
00:43:17,978 --> 00:43:20,113
From the
"I'd rather be Red
than Dead" fanatics

557
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,916
to "Bomb Moscow
right now" fanatics.

558
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,951
My choice, a messiah.

559
00:43:24,985 --> 00:43:27,353
Let's say you're right.
What next?

560
00:43:27,387 --> 00:43:30,957
A telegram,
a letter, or something
to the papers with,

561
00:43:30,991 --> 00:43:34,695
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

562
00:43:34,728 --> 00:43:37,998
And they'll make demands
and end up with,
"Obey or else."

563
00:43:39,833 --> 00:43:41,968
Where were you
at midnight last night?

564
00:43:43,303 --> 00:43:45,071
I beg your pardon?

565
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:47,774
This was delivered
about 10 minutes ago.

566
00:43:47,808 --> 00:43:52,813
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

567
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:54,514
"I have what
you're looking for."

568
00:43:54,547 --> 00:43:58,618
"I order your Citadel
of the Antichrist destroyed."

569
00:43:58,651 --> 00:44:02,555
"The President
will publicly announce
immediate compliance."

570
00:44:02,588 --> 00:44:06,559
"To prove that
I am to be obeyed,
there will be an incident."

571
00:44:06,592 --> 00:44:07,627
Unsigned.

572
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:31,117
They were carried in.
Routine delivery of crates.

573
00:44:31,151 --> 00:44:32,652
Carried in!

574
00:44:32,685 --> 00:44:33,854
Phony.

575
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:35,956
My God, Mr. Barrett,
we had no way of knowing.

576
00:44:35,989 --> 00:44:39,059
We had no idea
they'd do anything like this.
No idea at all. It's...

577
00:44:39,092 --> 00:44:40,393
It's so simple
it's ridiculous.

578
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:42,395
It's always the simple way
that works.

579
00:44:42,428 --> 00:44:43,529
Nothing?
MAN: Nothing.

580
00:44:43,563 --> 00:44:45,165
Only the fingerprints
that belong here.

581
00:44:45,198 --> 00:44:48,935
The crates were coded
with the right number,
the right color.

582
00:44:48,969 --> 00:44:52,238
And they were delivered
late Friday afternoon,
at 5:35.

583
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:54,074
No reason for the technicians
to open them.

584
00:44:54,107 --> 00:44:55,241
Exactly.

585
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:56,977
We're just to see
that nothing gets out.

586
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:59,645
Nothing. Everything that
comes in stays...

587
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,481
Eric.

588
00:45:06,152 --> 00:45:09,289
The General's here.
He got this this morning.

589
00:45:10,523 --> 00:45:13,093
It was phoned in last night.

590
00:45:13,126 --> 00:45:14,895
Pay phone,
Los Angeles Airport.

591
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:18,331
My God.

592
00:45:20,366 --> 00:45:22,235
How did they even know
he was here?

593
00:45:22,268 --> 00:45:24,737
Good question.

594
00:45:24,771 --> 00:45:27,607
Well, there's only
one thing to do.
Rip this whole place apart.

595
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,110
Get everybody in here.
Everyone else connected
with this place.

596
00:45:30,143 --> 00:45:34,247
Work them over. Meanwhile,
we'll keep the whole area
completely sealed off.

597
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,349
I think, except for
sealing off the area,

598
00:45:36,382 --> 00:45:38,919
we should do
the exact opposite.

599
00:45:38,952 --> 00:45:40,620
What do you mean?

600
00:45:40,653 --> 00:45:44,090
Everybody here, at E Lab,
knows exactly what happened.

601
00:45:44,124 --> 00:45:46,692
Certainly whoever
took the bugs know.

602
00:45:46,726 --> 00:45:49,195
But nobody outside
knows anything yet.

603
00:45:49,229 --> 00:45:51,731
Keep it that way.
Leave it wide open.

604
00:45:51,764 --> 00:45:54,835
Why?
So we don't force
anybody underground.

605
00:45:54,868 --> 00:45:58,839
Eric, there's got to be
at least an inside assist
from someone here

606
00:45:58,872 --> 00:46:00,807
at Station Three.

607
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,943
Whoever it is,
let's keep them
in the dark.

608
00:46:02,976 --> 00:46:04,911
Let's hope they make
a move, and if they do,
we'll know it.

609
00:46:04,945 --> 00:46:07,547
It may be the break
we're looking for.

610
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,116
Pretty dangerous, Lee.
Lot of ways to make a slip.

611
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,153
You know how long it'll take
to interrogate everybody.

612
00:46:13,186 --> 00:46:16,990
Cross check stories,
and run down leads.
We're under a time gun.

613
00:46:17,023 --> 00:46:20,160
You cannot conduct this
like a normal investigation.

614
00:46:20,193 --> 00:46:23,763
We've got to hope
that somebody, somehow,
will lead us to the bugs.

615
00:46:23,796 --> 00:46:27,200
Only the flasks are important,
nothing else.

616
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:27,868
What do we say
about Baxter?

617
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:28,701
Tell them nothing.

618
00:46:28,734 --> 00:46:31,437
What about this?
It doesn't exist.

619
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,441
(SIGHING)

620
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:39,045
I'll give the word
to Raskin.

621
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:41,915
CAVANAUGH: Raskin.

622
00:46:55,728 --> 00:46:57,397
Anything, Mr. Barrett?

623
00:46:57,430 --> 00:46:59,265
Mr. Cavanaugh will be in
in a moment.

624
00:46:59,299 --> 00:47:01,801
That was a very
brave thing you did,
Mr. Barrett.

625
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:03,536
To go into that vault.

626
00:47:03,569 --> 00:47:06,372
Maybe I knew
there wasn't any risk.
How could you know that?

627
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,707
Well, certainly,
whoever planned this
had accurate information.

628
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,410
Very accurate information.

629
00:47:10,443 --> 00:47:14,214
Like me you mean?
I'd put me at the top
of the list.

630
00:47:14,247 --> 00:47:16,549
Why would you steal
the Satan Bug, Mr. Barrett?

631
00:47:16,582 --> 00:47:19,119
Possession gives one
limitless power.

632
00:47:19,485 --> 00:47:20,720
Military power?

633
00:47:20,753 --> 00:47:23,356
And political power
and limitless wealth.

634
00:47:23,389 --> 00:47:27,260
The Satan Bug could
make one god on earth,
or the devil, if you please.

635
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:29,795
Isn't that enough
to tempt anyone?

636
00:47:29,829 --> 00:47:31,297
Dr. Hoffman, how long
will it take us to develop

637
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:33,900
a vaccine against
the Satan Bug?

638
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,270
As a scientist,
I cannot say never, but...

639
00:47:37,303 --> 00:47:41,074
Dr. Baxter was
not getting anywhere,
none of us were.

640
00:47:41,107 --> 00:47:43,843
Tasserly,
institute a crash program.

641
00:47:43,876 --> 00:47:46,046
Now.
Yes, sir.

642
00:47:51,151 --> 00:47:53,219
Sir, except
for those present,

643
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:56,089
we're taking
the official position
that nothing is missing.

644
00:47:56,122 --> 00:47:58,258
There's been a murder,
that's all.

645
00:47:58,291 --> 00:47:59,692
We say nothing
to anyone.

646
00:47:59,725 --> 00:48:01,861
A murder?
What about Dr. Baxter?

647
00:48:01,894 --> 00:48:06,366
There's a dead body in there.
It'll keep till Monday.
Dr. Baxter's just missing.

648
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:08,868
Meanwhile, of course,
we'll proceed with
the investigation.

649
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:11,071
How?
The usual way.

650
00:48:11,104 --> 00:48:13,373
What are we
supposed to do?

651
00:48:13,406 --> 00:48:16,576
What do you propose,
Mr. Tasserly?

652
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:20,513
I think I will stay here
at Station Three,
if you do not object.

653
00:48:20,546 --> 00:48:23,549
I'm very tired,
and I do not feel
like going home.

654
00:48:23,583 --> 00:48:24,884
TASSERLY: I'll go with you.

655
00:48:24,917 --> 00:48:26,953
Somehow, I...

656
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,521
Well, I should
like to be on call.

657
00:48:28,554 --> 00:48:31,691
I will be in D Wing rest area.
Do not hesitate to awaken me.

658
00:48:31,724 --> 00:48:33,793
Very well.

659
00:48:33,826 --> 00:48:35,595
The General is here,
Dr. Michaelson.

660
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:39,132
All of this is being
transmitted to Washington
in detail.

661
00:48:39,165 --> 00:48:42,102
All right. I'll be
in administration
with Tasserly.

662
00:48:43,136 --> 00:48:44,437
Station Three personnel?

663
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:45,671
Yes.

664
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:49,209
That telegram.

665
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:53,813
Could there have been a leak?
I mean, you don't think
it was a phony, do you?

666
00:48:53,846 --> 00:48:58,018
It could be a maneuver.
The bugs are gone.

667
00:48:59,252 --> 00:49:02,422
A lunatic
with the killer of all times.

668
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,225
Gives me the creeps.

669
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:08,628
This whole operation
gives me the creeps.

670
00:49:57,877 --> 00:49:59,912
How was Florida?

671
00:49:59,945 --> 00:50:01,847
Okay.
Quick trip.

672
00:50:03,616 --> 00:50:05,918
No quicker than
it was scheduled.

673
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,288
How'd you make out?

674
00:50:08,321 --> 00:50:10,223
I made out fine.

675
00:50:13,025 --> 00:50:14,160
Where's Ainsley?

676
00:50:14,194 --> 00:50:15,395
I don't know.

677
00:50:16,162 --> 00:50:17,497
When did he get here?

678
00:50:17,530 --> 00:50:18,698
He didn't.

679
00:50:20,866 --> 00:50:22,235
What do you mean,
he didn't?

680
00:50:22,268 --> 00:50:23,836
I mean
he didn't get here.

681
00:50:23,869 --> 00:50:25,938
And he didn't call.

682
00:50:27,273 --> 00:50:28,941
Did you call him?

683
00:50:28,974 --> 00:50:30,210
No, I didn't.

Hello.

686
00:51:28,201 --> 00:51:30,536
Yeah, this is
Dr. Ostrer's house.

687
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:34,174
Oh, I'm just
the air conditioning man.
I'm fixing the unit.

688
00:51:34,207 --> 00:51:38,043
Well, he just stepped out.
He said he'd be right back.
Can I take a message?

689
00:51:39,011 --> 00:51:40,946
To call who?

690
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:43,849
Ah, Ainsley?
How do you spell that?
A-N-S...

691
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:47,420
A-I-N-S-L-E-Y.

692
00:51:47,453 --> 00:51:50,290
Ah, that's right, Mr. Ainsley.
What number?

693

(PHONE CLICKS)

694
00:52:03,002 --> 00:52:04,670
What the hell
are you doing here?

695
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:07,640
Do you usually make
a habit of hanging around
people's swimming pools?

696
00:52:07,673 --> 00:52:09,442
I do when I see that.

697
00:52:27,193 --> 00:52:28,594
Is that Ostrer?

698
00:52:28,628 --> 00:52:30,363
Yeah. They wiped him out.

699
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:35,067
Could he have been
the inside assist?

700
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:37,703
Could be.

701
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:03,429
Cavanaugh, please.

702
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:07,400
Cavanaugh, Barrett here.
I'm at Ostrer's. He's dead.

703
00:53:07,433 --> 00:53:10,270
It's murder to me,
but it looks like
it could be suicide.

704
00:53:10,303 --> 00:53:11,971
He's floating
at the bottom of the pool.

705
00:53:12,004 --> 00:53:14,840
I'll fill you in
on the details later,
but more important,

706
00:53:14,874 --> 00:53:18,378
see if you can check
a call that just came in
to this number a minute ago.

707
00:53:18,411 --> 00:53:20,813
What does the name
Ainsley mean to you?

708
00:53:20,846 --> 00:53:23,215
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

709
00:53:23,249 --> 00:53:25,751
Uh-huh. That's him.
Millionaire crank.

710
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:28,087
Right at the top of the list
of crackpots.

711
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:30,323
A place in New York,
Santa Barbara and another one,

712
00:53:30,356 --> 00:53:33,326
I think, somewhere outside
of Phoenix. Nail him.

713
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,395
Don't touch him,
but don't let him
out of your sight.

714
00:53:35,428 --> 00:53:38,798
And don't let him know
he's being followed. Okay.

715
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,068
Now, honey,
what are you doing here?

716
00:53:43,102 --> 00:53:44,704
I was looking for you.

717
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,206
The incident?

718
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:48,908
Florida.

719
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:55,915
GENERAL: Well,
it's happened, Lee.

720
00:53:55,948 --> 00:53:58,618
Key West, Florida.
About an hour
and a half ago.

721
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:00,853
We have helicopters
in the area

722
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:04,557
making 16 millimeter films
of everything they can see
from the air.

723
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,559
Meanwhile, the coast line
is blocked off

724
00:54:06,592 --> 00:54:10,229
and we're at the present time
clearing the ocean for
200 miles off shore.

725
00:54:10,262 --> 00:54:11,631
How'd it happen?

726
00:54:11,664 --> 00:54:13,299
Nobody seems to know, exactly.

727
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,335
One reports says
there was a small explosion.

728
00:54:15,368 --> 00:54:17,703
Then everyone downwind
started dying.

729
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:19,339
We've closed down
all the news media,

730
00:54:19,372 --> 00:54:21,907
but we won't be able to
keep it quiet for long.

731
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:23,776
What's the attitude
in Washington?

732
00:54:23,809 --> 00:54:26,846
I would describe it
as controlled panic.

733
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:28,314
What do they expect
you to do?

734
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,616
Find whoever it is.
Deal with him.

735
00:54:30,650 --> 00:54:32,618
Buy him off, kill him,
whatever's necessary.

736
00:54:32,652 --> 00:54:34,186
But meanwhile?

737
00:54:34,219 --> 00:54:35,220
(PHONE RINGING)

738
00:54:35,254 --> 00:54:37,357
Yes. Speaking.

739
00:54:39,525 --> 00:54:41,226
Oh, are they clear?

740
00:54:43,696 --> 00:54:45,297
That bad, huh?

741
00:54:46,131 --> 00:54:47,933
When will the film be here?

742
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,738
Well, yes,
he's here now.
I'll tell him.

743
00:54:52,772 --> 00:54:56,376
I'll get back to you
as soon as I've seen
the film. Goodbye.

744
00:54:56,409 --> 00:54:59,779
They have the film on Florida
and they're shipping
a print out here right away.

745
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:03,849
Cavanaugh tells me that
he and his staff have drawn
a complete blank.

746
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:06,652
They checked out
everything and everybody
in Station Three,

747
00:55:06,686 --> 00:55:09,288
except Hoffman.
I want you to get on Hoffman.

748
00:55:09,321 --> 00:55:12,257
And push Cavanaugh
on that Ainsley lead.
That's the only one we've got.

749
00:55:12,291 --> 00:55:14,527
And we're not going to be
able to control this thing
very much longer.

750
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,028
Yes, sir.

751
00:55:16,061 --> 00:55:19,331
Oh, that film is going to
arrive at Station Three
about 4:00.

752
00:55:19,365 --> 00:55:22,067
Get it here
as soon as it arrives.

753
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:24,570
Get me this number,
will you, Ann?

754
00:55:24,604 --> 00:55:26,772
Now, you left
the research center
in Zurich

755
00:55:26,806 --> 00:55:29,074
after you accepted
your position here.
Is that correct?

756
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:34,179
Yes. But as you know,
I went on a four-week
motor tour before I reported.

757
00:55:34,213 --> 00:55:35,781
Reported to Washington?

758
00:55:35,815 --> 00:55:38,918
Yes. Well, actually,
to the United States Counsel
at Naples

759
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:40,720
before I boarded the Da Vinci.

760
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:41,787
And that was in...

761
00:55:41,821 --> 00:55:44,990
That was five months ago.
The exact date was...

762
00:55:45,024 --> 00:55:46,592
Oh, I have it here.

763
00:55:47,493 --> 00:55:50,195
You were out of touch
while touring?

764
00:55:50,229 --> 00:55:54,033
I had no set plans.
I motored through the Tyrol,
across the Brenner,

765
00:55:54,066 --> 00:55:59,238
Lake Lugano.
Naturally, if I had been
needed here immediately...

766
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:04,043
It was a... It was kind of
therapeutic irresponsibility.

767
00:56:04,076 --> 00:56:06,446
Lee, we just got
the last word on Ainsley.

768
00:56:06,479 --> 00:56:08,514
Looks like we're on target.

769
00:56:09,582 --> 00:56:10,950
Excuse me.

770
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:13,819
Mr. Barrett.

771
00:56:13,853 --> 00:56:14,987
Yes?

772
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:21,260
That bulletin over the radio
about the trouble in Florida,
the...

773
00:56:21,927 --> 00:56:23,295
It sounded as if...

774
00:56:23,328 --> 00:56:24,997
We think
it's the botulinus.

775
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:28,768
My God.
Why, Mr. Barrett?

776
00:56:28,801 --> 00:56:29,835
We don't know.

777
00:56:29,869 --> 00:56:32,237
But for what purpose?

778
00:56:32,271 --> 00:56:34,640
We're trying to
find that out. Excuse me.

779
00:56:36,676 --> 00:56:38,210
He's disappeared.

780
00:56:38,243 --> 00:56:40,846
The Santa Barbara house
and the Phoenix place
have been closed for months.

781
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,048
He was last seen
in his New York place.

782
00:56:43,082 --> 00:56:45,117
How long ago was that?
Eight months.

783
00:56:45,150 --> 00:56:47,953
We ran everybody
who ever said hello to him
through the wringer.

784
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,154
His ex-housekeeper
in New York

785
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:51,857
said that he told her
he was going on a world tour.

786
00:56:51,891 --> 00:56:54,794
Somebody bought the tickets.
Travel agency must have
a schedule.

787
00:56:54,827 --> 00:56:58,598
She said Ainsley is
not the kind of man
you ask questions of.

788
00:56:58,631 --> 00:57:00,432
Well, what does he look like?
We have any pictures?

789
00:57:00,466 --> 00:57:01,634
No.

790
00:57:01,667 --> 00:57:03,536
There's no reason
for anybody to keep
a file on him.

791
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:05,938
No pictures,
newspaper morgue,
no personal stuff?

792
00:57:05,971 --> 00:57:11,443
None. He's an eccentric.
No pictures, no relatives,
no public life.

793
00:57:11,477 --> 00:57:13,378
Visual description
from all concerned.

794
00:57:13,412 --> 00:57:17,817
Age, 50-something.
Height, medium. Hair, brown.
Coloring, normal.

795

796
00:57:19,084 --> 00:57:21,721
No other leads,
nothing?
No.

If anybody could beat
any haystacks any flatter
than we have.

798
00:57:25,290 --> 00:57:29,028
Lee, look. He's the only name
that's dropped into this
from the outside.

799
00:57:29,061 --> 00:57:31,296
And he's vanished
from the face of the earth.

800
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:35,034
Everything we know about him
fits the man that
sent that telegram.

801
00:57:35,067 --> 00:57:38,771
Lunatic fringe, crank,
rich, with resources.

802
00:57:38,804 --> 00:57:40,840

to be a coincidence.

no question about it.

Did they
tell them everything?

No, sir, I'm sorry,
I can't.

give the press everything.

That call could have
come from any place
in the country.

850
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:17,189
It would take a week
to track it down, if then.

851
01:01:22,027 --> 01:01:24,563
AINSLEY ON TAPE:
Don't interrupt.

852
01:01:24,596 --> 01:01:27,800
GENERAL: All right,
I'm listening. Go ahead.

853
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:30,502
AINSLEY: You've seen
what I've done in Florida.

854
01:01:30,535 --> 01:01:32,772
You have ignored my order.

855
01:01:32,805 --> 01:01:37,409
Continue, and you will
sacrifice hundreds of
thousands of innocent lives.

856
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:40,245
Los Angeles next.

857
01:01:40,712 --> 01:01:42,748
Noon tomorrow!

858
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,049
GENERAL: Who is this?

859
01:01:44,083 --> 01:01:45,918
Who is this?

860
01:01:45,951 --> 01:01:50,455
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

861
01:01:50,489 --> 01:01:52,391
GENERAL: Now listen,
don't hang up.

862
01:01:52,424 --> 01:01:54,293
I'll agree to meet you
anywhere you say.

863
01:01:54,326 --> 01:01:57,196
But you must realize
that we have to discuss...

864
01:02:02,835 --> 01:02:05,237
CAVANAUGH: Operator! Operator!

865
01:02:05,270 --> 01:02:08,140
A call just came through
on this number, trace it.

866
01:02:13,612 --> 01:02:15,915
We have to get every man
in the country to find him.

867
01:02:15,948 --> 01:02:18,517
We're already doing that,
but it's too late,
he could be anywhere.

868
01:02:19,051 --> 01:02:22,187
And he has those flasks.

869
01:02:22,221 --> 01:02:25,190
Yes, I know that General,
and we can't evacuate
Los Angeles.

870
01:02:25,224 --> 01:02:26,658
We don't have time.

871
01:02:26,691 --> 01:02:30,129
We'll have to try.
Meanwhile, we keep stalling
and hope for a break.

872
01:02:32,097 --> 01:02:33,198
Sir.

873
01:02:35,034 --> 01:02:37,536
Don't you think
we should capitulate?

874
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:40,539
Station Three
will only be the beginning.

875
01:02:40,572 --> 01:02:43,809
It's a bluff. It must be.
No one would do such a thing.

876
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,878
Are you prepared
to take that chance?

877
01:02:45,911 --> 01:02:47,179
Bring the tape recorder
with you.

878
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:49,915
There's no point in
continuing this charade
of hiding out here.

879
01:02:49,949 --> 01:02:52,351
Lee, I'd like to have you
check out...

880
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:54,519
What is it?

881
01:02:55,420 --> 01:02:57,189
Why did he give his name?

882
01:02:57,222 --> 01:03:01,460
It doesn't make any sense.
It would have been better
to keep us guessing.

883
01:03:01,493 --> 01:03:03,728
I don't agree.
That's exactly what
a paranoid would do.

884
01:03:03,762 --> 01:03:06,565
You heard that voice.
A monstrous ego working.

885
01:03:06,598 --> 01:03:09,034
No, sir,
there's something wrong.

886
01:03:09,068 --> 01:03:10,936
GENERAL: What?

887
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:14,506
I can't put my finger on it,
I don't really know.

888
01:03:14,539 --> 01:03:16,241
We'll be at Station Three.

889
01:03:34,259 --> 01:03:35,694
I checked out
the car for you, Lee.

890
01:03:35,727 --> 01:03:38,097
He got a flat
coming down the canyon.
Where?

891
01:03:38,130 --> 01:03:40,532
It was picked up
about a half mile
down the road.

892
01:03:40,565 --> 01:03:42,634
A couple hundred feet
above split rock.

893
01:03:42,667 --> 01:03:45,070
You remember, we caught
some trout there.

894
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:47,406
You can still see the marks
on the shoulder.

895
01:03:47,439 --> 01:03:48,840
See you.

896
01:03:53,879 --> 01:03:56,015
What's the significance
of the car, Lee?

897
01:03:56,048 --> 01:03:59,251
Nothing, just checking,
you check everything.

898
01:04:25,510 --> 01:04:28,113
Is that where
the car got the flat?

899
01:04:28,147 --> 01:04:31,183
Well, the car
slipped off the jack.

900
01:04:31,216 --> 01:04:33,052
Obviously, he tried
to dig a hole to get it
back on and couldn't,

901
01:04:33,618 --> 01:04:35,154
so he abandoned it.

902
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:38,323
Come on.

903
01:04:51,736 --> 01:04:55,407
All right, sit down here, Ann.
Now follow me on this.

904
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:58,377
Everybody figures

905
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:00,745
that whoever
took the bugs got out.

906
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,182
They're gone.

907
01:05:03,215 --> 01:05:07,086
The inside assist,
Ostrer, he's dead.

908
01:05:08,553 --> 01:05:12,491
But let's suppose
that there's another man
that's tied up in all this,

909
01:05:12,524 --> 01:05:15,560
who's still here,
who can't get out.

910
01:05:15,594 --> 01:05:18,230
Why does he have to get out?
Why doesn't he just stay here?

911
01:05:18,263 --> 01:05:19,931
Because he's got
something vital.

912
01:05:19,965 --> 01:05:23,602
Something that Ainsley's
got to have, and he's
got to have in a hurry.

913
01:05:23,635 --> 01:05:24,970
I don't understand.

914
01:05:26,405 --> 01:05:28,573
Two men got into E Lab.

915
01:05:28,607 --> 01:05:31,076
One got out as Baxter,
he walked out.

916
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:32,944
The other one
through the fence
with the bugs.

917
01:05:32,978 --> 01:05:34,746
Let's say that they met
this third man,

918
01:05:34,779 --> 01:05:37,116
who took all the flasks,
except two,

919
01:05:37,149 --> 01:05:40,919
which he gave to them,
and then they took off,
probably in Baxter's car.

920
01:05:40,952 --> 01:05:43,922
One flask for Florida.
One for Los Angeles.

921
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:45,457
I've got that.

922
01:05:45,490 --> 01:05:50,029
Now, let's say that
this third man takes off
with the rest of the flasks.

923
01:05:50,062 --> 01:05:52,231
But he's got one more thing
that he must do.

924
01:05:52,264 --> 01:05:54,733
Knock off Ostrer,
who's a threat somehow.

925
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:56,735
Let's say
he knocks off Ostrer,

926
01:05:56,768 --> 01:05:59,304
comes down this road,
free and clear.

927
01:05:59,338 --> 01:06:01,440
And then the nightmare
of all criminals happens.

928
01:06:01,473 --> 01:06:03,508
The senseless accident.

929
01:06:05,310 --> 01:06:06,511
The flat.
Right!

930
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:09,214
He tries to fix it,
the car slips off the jack.

931
01:06:09,248 --> 01:06:12,084
Now he's stuck.
What would you do?

932
01:06:12,117 --> 01:06:13,618
I'd hitchhike down the road.

933
01:06:13,652 --> 01:06:14,853
But the bugs?

934
01:06:14,886 --> 01:06:16,388
You couldn't take a chance
on taking them with you

935
01:06:16,421 --> 01:06:17,956
and you wouldn't leave them
in the car.

936
01:06:17,989 --> 01:06:20,559
So, where would you put them
where they'd be safe?

937
01:06:20,592 --> 01:06:22,994
Where you could
get to them when you
were free to

938
01:06:23,028 --> 01:06:25,064
and where they'd stay cool.

939
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,135
The water.

940
01:06:30,169 --> 01:06:31,203
I'd hide them in the water.

941
01:06:31,236 --> 01:06:32,637
That's what I think.

942
01:06:55,494 --> 01:06:56,728
Lee!

943
01:07:45,510 --> 01:07:47,246
Whose car was that?

944
01:07:47,279 --> 01:07:48,947
Just stand.

945
01:07:50,081 --> 01:07:51,983
Perfectly still.

946
01:07:55,787 --> 01:07:57,356
Handle that gently.

947
01:08:01,226 --> 01:08:03,262
Those misses were intentional.

948
01:08:03,295 --> 01:08:05,464
Stand exactly
where you are, Ann.

949
01:08:14,973 --> 01:08:17,709
And that I presume
was Doctor Baxter?

950
01:08:17,742 --> 01:08:19,978
Just put the flask
back in the box.

951
01:09:45,363 --> 01:09:46,665
Sit down.

952
01:10:09,053 --> 01:10:11,290
There's a phone call for you
in the administration,
Mr. Cavanaugh.

953
01:10:11,323 --> 01:10:12,491
Thank you.

954
01:10:33,945 --> 01:10:35,647
Absolutely no sign of them.

955
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:37,649
We checked out
Barrett's car.

956
01:10:37,682 --> 01:10:40,251
No sign of violence
there or anywhere.

957
01:10:40,285 --> 01:10:43,254
Just some footprints
down by the bank
of the stream. Nothing else.

958
01:10:43,288 --> 01:10:45,189
Have you heard
anything here?

959
01:10:45,223 --> 01:10:46,725
No.

960
01:10:46,758 --> 01:10:48,827
He hasn't been missing long.
He could be anywhere.

961
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,295
You know what
he's like, sir.

962
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:54,466
I don't understand why
Barrett is so interested
in Dr. Hoffman's car.

963
01:10:54,499 --> 01:10:55,934
I don't either, sir.

964
01:10:55,967 --> 01:10:57,436
The Highway Patrol
officer said...

965
01:10:57,469 --> 01:10:58,002
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

966
01:10:58,036 --> 01:10:59,571
Yes?

967
01:10:59,604 --> 01:11:01,706
MAN ON INTERCOM:
Mr. Cavanaugh?
Johnson's on the line.

968
01:11:01,740 --> 01:11:03,207
Put him on.
JOHNSON: Hello?

969
01:11:03,241 --> 01:11:05,276
Yes, Johnson.

970
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:07,512
No sign of them
in any of the places
we've looked in town.

971
01:11:07,546 --> 01:11:09,914
Keep looking.
Yes, sir.

972
01:11:09,948 --> 01:11:14,619
The officer said that Barrett
just wanted to know where
the doctor had had the flat.

973
01:11:14,653 --> 01:11:18,557
Well, so what?
We knew about it.
You had a flat last night.

974
01:11:18,590 --> 01:11:22,427
You started to hitchhike,
they picked you up outside
of town and brought you here.

975
01:11:22,461 --> 01:11:23,828
I was very lucky.

976
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:27,031
That road is lonely at night,
but I was picked up
in the canyon.

977
01:11:27,065 --> 01:11:28,367
Not outside of town.

978
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,701
Yes.

979
01:11:29,734 --> 01:11:33,037
Barrett is liable to call us
anytime from anywhere.

980
01:11:33,071 --> 01:11:35,340
I think it means nothing.

981
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,708
I've pulled
all the roadblocks.

982
01:11:36,741 --> 01:11:39,478
You want me to
put them back,
just in case?

983
01:11:39,511 --> 01:11:40,579
GENERAL: No point in that.

984
01:11:40,612 --> 01:11:41,446
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

985
01:11:41,480 --> 01:11:43,214
GENERAL: Yes?

986
01:11:43,247 --> 01:11:44,749
MAN ON INTERCOM:
There's a call
for Dr. Hoffman.

987
01:11:44,783 --> 01:11:47,452
GENERAL:
Put it through. Doctor.

988
01:11:47,486 --> 01:11:49,721
DONALD: Doctor Hoffman?
Yes.

989
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:51,990
Hello, Gregor,
this is Donald.

990
01:11:52,023 --> 01:11:56,728
Sorry to disturb you,
but we were going fishing
this afternoon, remember?

991
01:11:56,761 --> 01:11:59,230
Well, I... I couldn't,
I was tied up here.

992
01:11:59,263 --> 01:12:02,033
Sorry you missed out,
the fishing was good.

993
01:12:02,066 --> 01:12:05,837
Do you have to work tonight?
We're at your trailer.
How about dinner?

994
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:08,973
(STUTTERING) Well, Donald,
I... I do not see how...

995
01:12:09,007 --> 01:12:13,778
I wish you could.
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

996
01:12:13,812 --> 01:12:15,346
Well, it would be
very nice, Donald...

997
01:12:15,380 --> 01:12:17,849
There's no need
for you to stay here now.

998
01:12:17,882 --> 01:12:20,585
Jeff, run the Doctor home.
All right, Eric.

999
01:12:20,619 --> 01:12:21,786
Thank you.

1000
01:12:21,820 --> 01:12:24,389
I will be there
in a few minutes, Donald.
Good.

1001
01:12:48,547 --> 01:12:50,549
Thank you.

1002
01:13:22,180 --> 01:13:24,148
DONALD: He stopped on
the road, slid down the bank,

1003
01:13:24,182 --> 01:13:27,318
and got to the flasks
before we did.

1004
01:13:27,351 --> 01:13:28,987
This is the only place
we had to hide 'em.

1005
01:13:29,020 --> 01:13:32,356
I know it was taking
a chance to call you.

1006
01:13:32,390 --> 01:13:35,560
But I was afraid
you were caught.
He knew about your car.

1007
01:13:35,594 --> 01:13:39,197
Now we're stuck.
There are roadblocks
all over the place.

1008
01:13:40,632 --> 01:13:42,400
Everything's fine, Donald.

1009
01:13:42,433 --> 01:13:46,337
Nobody's suspicious,
and the roadblocks
have been removed.

1010
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:52,243
It seems that Mr. Barrett
is so unpredictable

1011
01:13:52,276 --> 01:13:55,246
that nothing has been made
of their disappearance.

1012
01:13:57,348 --> 01:13:59,984
Did Los Angeles
go as planned, Veretti?

1013
01:14:00,018 --> 01:14:01,285
I put it there.

1014
01:14:10,161 --> 01:14:11,663
We will take them
with us.

1015
01:14:11,696 --> 01:14:13,097
That's dangerous.

1016
01:14:13,131 --> 01:14:15,399
If there is any trouble,
they will be our
best protection.

1017
01:14:24,843 --> 01:14:28,479
There's nothing happening yet.
They're still all
in the trailer.

1018
01:14:28,513 --> 01:14:30,849
GENERAL: What about
the manager?

1019
01:14:30,882 --> 01:14:32,483
Oh, we're keeping
the manager out of the way.

1020
01:14:32,517 --> 01:14:34,586
Do you think Barrett saw you?
Possibly.

1021
01:14:34,619 --> 01:14:36,955
But he'd never recognize me,
he's never seen me before.

1022
01:14:36,988 --> 01:14:38,422
Can you see anything
going on in there?

1023
01:14:38,456 --> 01:14:43,061
There's no movement,
no sound, no,
nothing happening.

1024
01:14:43,094 --> 01:14:44,395
Keep on the line.

1025
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:46,164
MICHAELSON: Why would
Dr. Hoffman be
connected with this?

1026
01:14:46,197 --> 01:14:47,498
Why? I don't understand.

1027
01:14:47,532 --> 01:14:49,601
He checked out perfectly.
There's nothing
in his background

1028
01:14:49,634 --> 01:14:52,136
to indicate that he's...
Dr. Michaelson, please.

1029
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:54,138
We've got to grab them, sir.
Right now.

1030
01:14:54,172 --> 01:14:56,274
Certainly not,
Cavanaugh.

1031
01:14:56,307 --> 01:14:59,944
Now, we know that Barrett
is in Dr. Hoffman's trailer
with two strange men.

1032
01:14:59,978 --> 01:15:03,748
And we know that Dr. Hoffman
is there and he's connected
with those men.

1033
01:15:03,782 --> 01:15:08,086
And we know Dr. Hoffman's car
had some special
significance to Barrett.

1034
01:15:08,119 --> 01:15:10,088
And that's all we know.

1035
01:15:10,121 --> 01:15:14,158
We don't even know
if Barrett went there
willingly or unwillingly.

1036
01:15:14,192 --> 01:15:16,394
Let me grab them, sir,
and I'll find out.

1037
01:15:16,427 --> 01:15:18,496
I don't think you'd find out
anything that would be worth

1038
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:19,163
losing the only advantage
we have.

1039
01:15:19,197 --> 01:15:23,568
MICHAELSON: What is that?

1040
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:26,871
They will lead us
to Ainsley, to the flasks.

1041
01:15:27,639 --> 01:15:30,174
Only the flasks
are important.

1042
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:33,377
This is the break
we've been praying for.

1043
01:15:33,411 --> 01:15:36,715
They're going to leave.
We let them.

1044
01:15:36,748 --> 01:15:39,851
Then we shadow them,
very carefully.

1045
01:15:39,884 --> 01:15:43,855
Let one eager beaver
show our hand,
and we're through.

1046
01:15:43,888 --> 01:15:45,189
Now set it up.

1047
01:15:46,490 --> 01:15:49,994
In the desert we're okay,
not much traffic.

1048
01:15:50,028 --> 01:15:51,696
But we could lose them
in the first town.

1049
01:15:51,730 --> 01:15:53,031
And what if they head
for that mess that'll be

1050
01:15:53,064 --> 01:15:55,299
coming out of Los Angeles?
We'll change
our strategy by then.

1051
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,001
At least we'll know
which way they're headed.

1052
01:15:57,035 --> 01:15:58,737
Set it up.
Yes, sir.

(HELICOPTER FLYING)

1055
01:16:14,753 --> 01:16:20,358
It is too early to say yet
how effective this will be,
or how possible it will be.

1056
01:16:20,391 --> 01:16:23,594
There is no further
official word as to the exact
imminence of the threat.

1057
01:16:23,628 --> 01:16:26,665
It means nothing.
There are military training
fields all around here.

1058

is related to this situation.

1059

PILOT ON RADIO:
I'm staying above
and behind them.

1060
01:16:32,270 --> 01:16:35,173
They're still traveling west
on 17.

1061
01:16:35,206 --> 01:16:36,808
They seem to be stalling.

1062
01:16:36,841 --> 01:16:39,410
They're almost
going around in circles.

1063
01:16:39,443 --> 01:16:41,279
Why?

1064
01:16:41,312 --> 01:16:45,449
Evasive action.
They're taking the long way
to wherever they're going.

1065
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:55,894
It's getting
a little difficult
to keep them in sight.

1066
01:16:55,927 --> 01:16:59,430
This is pretty rough country
and it's closing in
on the road.

1067
01:16:59,463 --> 01:17:01,299
I don't like this section
they're going through.

1068
01:17:01,332 --> 01:17:04,468
It's impossible to keep
visual contact without
the chopper tipping its hand.

1069
01:17:04,502 --> 01:17:08,239
There are only three points
they can come out of there,
here, here and here.

1070
01:17:08,272 --> 01:17:09,974
You have men covering
all of them, haven't you?

1071
01:17:10,008 --> 01:17:13,044
Yes, sir. I'll double up
here and here.

1072
01:17:13,077 --> 01:17:15,246
PILOT: I'm going to lose them
for a long stretch now.

1073
01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:16,881
Unless I close in.

1074
01:17:16,915 --> 01:17:18,817
Don't close up,
stay out of sight

1075
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:21,219
until you can pick them up
on the other side
of the section.

1076

None.

1084
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:41,833

They've turned left
onto Seco Road now.

1102

They slowed down and...
Well, for a moment we got
awfully close to them.

1103
01:21:43,847 --> 01:21:47,818
Did they see you?
Well, I'm not sure,
they might have.

if they spot us?

to where the flask is
and immobilize it?

1181
01:30:21,499 --> 01:30:24,367
Perhaps you had better
get in the car, Mr. Barrett.

1182
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:31,642
On the other side.

1183
01:30:48,358 --> 01:30:49,693
I determined in
the laboratory

1184
01:30:49,727 --> 01:30:53,196
that only a four
and a half pound pressure
shatters this flask.

1185
01:30:54,965 --> 01:30:56,767
I can easily apply that.

1186
01:31:11,314 --> 01:31:13,350
I spotted
the station wagon again.

1187
01:31:13,383 --> 01:31:16,787
They're still moving north
on Seco Road.

1188
01:31:16,820 --> 01:31:18,889
Any sign of
the follow car?

1189
01:31:20,090 --> 01:31:22,526
No.

1190
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:26,664
It looks like there's
some kind of fire back there
where they came from.

1191
01:31:26,697 --> 01:31:28,932
A lot of orange flame
on the horizon.

1192
01:31:28,966 --> 01:31:32,536
You'd better get
somebody in there, fast.

1193
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:35,906
What are your plans now,
what do you intend to do,
Mr. Ainsley?

1194
01:31:37,074 --> 01:31:39,242
Ah, I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

1195
01:31:39,276 --> 01:31:41,945
Ainsley's been missing
for months and Hoffman's
been on the scene for months.

1196
01:31:41,979 --> 01:31:44,347
Or at least you're
an impersonation of
the real Hoffman.

1197
01:31:44,381 --> 01:31:45,816
What happened to him?

1198
01:31:48,118 --> 01:31:50,420
That's not hard to figure.
Gregor Hoffman,
living in Vienna,

1199
01:31:50,453 --> 01:31:51,555
hired by Baxter
from Austria.

1200
01:31:51,589 --> 01:31:54,692
Did you kill him
or did you have him killed?

1201
01:31:54,725 --> 01:31:57,227
You're no biochemist,
how did you fool them?

1202
01:31:57,260 --> 01:31:59,496
I am a biochemist,
Mr. Barrett, of sorts.

1203
01:31:59,529 --> 01:32:01,464
If you were more familiar
with the name Ainsley,

1204
01:32:01,498 --> 01:32:04,101
you'd know
I made my fortune
in patent medicines.

1205
01:32:04,134 --> 01:32:07,204
Sometimes a little bit of
knowledge goes a long way.

1206
01:32:07,237 --> 01:32:08,872
The accent? Easy.

1207
01:32:08,906 --> 01:32:10,808
I lived for years
in Austria.

1208
01:32:10,841 --> 01:32:13,343
Besides, Gregor Hoffman,
though he lived
an obscure life,

1209
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:15,278
was a world famous chemist.

1210
01:32:15,312 --> 01:32:17,815
You don't ask
a famous chemist
the formula for salt.

1211
01:32:17,848 --> 01:32:19,917
But Ostrer did.
You had everyone fooled
but Ostrer.

1212
01:32:19,950 --> 01:32:22,953
He knew you weren't
the real Hoffman,
so he died, too.

1213
01:32:22,986 --> 01:32:25,088
That tone is
surprisingly juvenile,
Mr. Barrett.

1214
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:27,490
I believe that
hundreds of people
might have died in Florida.

1215
01:32:27,524 --> 01:32:30,093
This afternoon when
I was interrogating you,
you heard Cavanaugh say that.

1216
01:32:30,127 --> 01:32:32,362
Ainsley was our man.
Then you knew what to do.

1217
01:32:32,395 --> 01:32:33,831
Somehow you made
two telephone calls.

1218
01:32:33,864 --> 01:32:35,899
One to your boys
to pick up the flasks
where you had to leave them

1219
01:32:35,933 --> 01:32:37,167
in the stream
and the other
to the General.

1220
01:32:37,200 --> 01:32:39,469
So you could give us
your ultimatum on Los Angeles.

1221
01:32:39,502 --> 01:32:41,672
Use the name C.R. Ainsley
so he would drop
the road blocks

1222
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:43,974
and you could get out,
and he fell for it.

1223
01:32:44,007 --> 01:32:45,242
That's correct.

1224
01:32:45,275 --> 01:32:47,177
I didn't make
the telephone calls
somehow, Mr. Barrett.

1225
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:48,946
I made them from
Station Three.

1226
01:32:48,979 --> 01:32:52,082
As you're so fond of saying
there's no such thing
as perfect security.

1227
01:32:52,115 --> 01:32:54,084
(SIRENS WAILING)

1228
01:33:02,459 --> 01:33:03,827
Don't try it, Mr. Barrett.

1229
01:33:03,861 --> 01:33:05,896
You're lucky
but you're mortal.
We all are.

based in Southern California
has ceased operation.

1236

It will be dismantled
and cease to exist.
End announcement.

1237
01:33:51,675 --> 01:33:53,110
There he is.

1238
01:33:53,143 --> 01:33:54,544
Who's that with him?

1239
01:33:54,577 --> 01:33:56,146
I don't know.

1240
01:34:15,465 --> 01:34:17,701
You're under arrest,
Doctor Hoffman.

1241
01:34:19,102 --> 01:34:20,871
You're Lee Barrett,
aren't you?
That's right.

1242
01:34:20,904 --> 01:34:22,305
What are you
doing here, Barrett?

1243
01:34:22,339 --> 01:34:24,007
That's a long story.

1244
01:34:24,975 --> 01:34:27,044
Get out of the car, Doctor.

1245
01:34:27,077 --> 01:34:30,413
BARRETT: Be careful,
he's got a flask
in his pocket.

1246
01:34:36,453 --> 01:34:38,421
All right,
hand it over, Doctor.

1247
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:41,291
Right now.

1248
01:34:43,126 --> 01:34:44,862
The end of the line?

1249
01:34:55,973 --> 01:34:58,141
All right,
get into the car, Doctor.

1250
01:35:00,143 --> 01:35:02,312
Better come along
with us, Barrett.

1251
01:35:05,282 --> 01:35:06,716
How did you get here?

1252
01:35:06,750 --> 01:35:07,818
We're spread
all over the place.

1253
01:35:07,851 --> 01:35:09,586
This is one of
50 we're covering.

1254
01:35:09,619 --> 01:35:11,154
What about the girl
and the two other guys?

1255
01:35:11,188 --> 01:35:12,890
I don't know.
Where's Cavanaugh?

1256
01:35:12,923 --> 01:35:14,992
They could be anywhere.
Our orders were
to pick up Hoffman,

1257
01:35:15,025 --> 01:35:16,326
stay off the radio,
and don't say a word

1258
01:35:16,359 --> 01:35:18,461
until we get him
to Station Three.

1259
01:35:29,239 --> 01:35:32,175
(WHISPERING) Have you
got enough sense to
keep your mouth shut?

1260
01:35:32,209 --> 01:35:33,210
Yes.

1261
01:35:35,012 --> 01:35:38,048
We've got
a jack-knifed truck up here.
You can turn your engine off.

1262
01:35:38,081 --> 01:35:41,952
It won't be long.
The tow truck will have it
out of here in a few minutes.

1263
01:35:41,985 --> 01:35:43,386
Anybody hurt?

1264
01:35:43,420 --> 01:35:45,055
No, he was lucky.

1265
01:35:54,564 --> 01:35:57,134
We got a jack-knifed truck,
it won't be long.

1266
01:36:10,547 --> 01:36:14,151
Won't be long he says.
Did you ever hear
a cop say anything else?

1267
01:36:14,184 --> 01:36:15,785
It'll be hours.

1268
01:36:15,819 --> 01:36:19,622
By that time, that mess
from L.A. will hit us
and we'll never move.

1269
01:36:21,024 --> 01:36:24,127
Look at all those cans
and busted beer bottles.

1270
01:36:24,161 --> 01:36:27,931
You'd think
people wouldn't throw
things out there like that.

1271
01:36:27,965 --> 01:36:29,432
You got a match?

1272
01:36:29,466 --> 01:36:31,368
Would you look at the jerk
handling that tow truck?

1273
01:36:31,401 --> 01:36:34,004
He's worse than the man
that was driving the rig.

1274
01:36:34,037 --> 01:36:35,505
Oh, boy,
that's all we need.

1275
01:36:35,538 --> 01:36:37,274
A sidewalk superintendent.

1276
01:36:38,275 --> 01:36:40,110
Wise guy, huh?

1277
01:37:05,135 --> 01:37:06,603
There's your daughter,
but what's happened
to Barrett?

1278
01:37:06,636 --> 01:37:08,205
Where's Hoffman?

1279
01:37:10,140 --> 01:37:12,876
Dad! Dad!

1280
01:37:12,910 --> 01:37:15,545
Dad, Lee's dead.
They threw a flask,

1281
01:37:15,578 --> 01:37:17,080
they threw a flask
back at the gas station.

1282
01:37:17,114 --> 01:37:18,715
What happened to Barrett,
where is he?

1283
01:37:18,748 --> 01:37:20,383
You've got to
go clear out the area.
He's at the station.

1284
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:22,920
Don't you understand?
That man Veretti,
he threw a flask.

1285
01:37:22,953 --> 01:37:24,187
Sir.

1286
01:37:28,225 --> 01:37:29,092
Where is the Satan Bug?

1287
01:37:29,126 --> 01:37:30,460
Hoffman took it.
He changed cars

1288
01:37:30,493 --> 01:37:32,229
and he went back
the way we came from.
What kind of car was it?

1289
01:37:32,262 --> 01:37:34,131
It was a green Ford sedan.

1290
01:37:34,164 --> 01:37:35,565
License?
Oh, I don't know,

1291
01:37:35,598 --> 01:37:39,002
I couldn't see it
very clearly. It was
FGA, something, 7, I think.

1292
01:37:39,036 --> 01:37:41,071
Put it on the radio.
Hey, give me that stuff.

1293
01:37:41,104 --> 01:37:42,772
Dad, you've got to go back
and clear out that area.

1294
01:37:42,805 --> 01:37:44,841
That's all right, dear,
that's all right.

1295
01:37:44,874 --> 01:37:45,943
The flask is harmless now.

1296
01:37:45,976 --> 01:37:48,912
The station burned.
There's nothing
to worry about.

1297
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:51,548
We found the bodies
of Cavanaugh's men,
but not Lee's.

1298
01:37:51,581 --> 01:37:53,083
But Lee was in the building.
He was in the building.

1299
01:37:53,116 --> 01:37:57,720
Well, he's not there now.
Ann, Los Angeles,

1300
01:37:57,754 --> 01:38:00,991
did anyone say anything
about Los Angeles? Anything?

1301
01:38:01,024 --> 01:38:02,359
No. Nothing.

1302
01:38:02,392 --> 01:38:04,561
Put everything you've got
on Hoffman's car.

1303
01:38:04,594 --> 01:38:06,263
Yes, sir.
We're already on it.

1304
01:38:06,296 --> 01:38:08,331
But there are an awful lot of
green Fords around.

1305
01:38:08,365 --> 01:38:11,568
And there's nothing
on these guys
except this stuff.

1306
01:38:11,601 --> 01:38:15,638
Guns, money, watches,
phony drivers license

1307
01:38:16,739 --> 01:38:18,608
and keys.

1308
01:38:18,641 --> 01:38:21,544
Maybe one of the keys
fits something in Los Angeles.

1309
01:38:21,578 --> 01:38:23,613
But how the hell
do we check that?

1310
01:39:00,117 --> 01:39:02,452
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

1311
01:39:02,485 --> 01:39:04,421
Sounds like the ignition.

1312
01:39:27,844 --> 01:39:29,746
Take a look
at that fuel pump.

1313
01:39:45,628 --> 01:39:47,897
You didn't really think
that I'd fall for
those goons of yours

1314
01:39:47,930 --> 01:39:50,100
posing as Cavanaugh's men,
did you?

1315
01:39:59,109 --> 01:40:01,411
Okay, I've got the gun now.

1316
01:40:01,444 --> 01:40:04,447
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1317
01:40:04,481 --> 01:40:06,716
before that copter of yours
settles down.

1318
01:40:06,749 --> 01:40:08,551
You haven't given me
any reason why
I won't smash this.

1319
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:13,323
This is the end of the line,
Ainsley.

1320
01:40:13,356 --> 01:40:14,891
For real now.

1321
01:40:14,924 --> 01:40:16,593
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1322
01:40:16,626 --> 01:40:18,528
or I'll blow
a hole in your head!

1323
01:40:22,265 --> 01:40:25,802
You're psychotic,
but don't be stupid.

1324
01:40:25,835 --> 01:40:28,871
If I blow a hole
in your head or you
drop that bottle,

1325
01:40:28,905 --> 01:40:31,741
you'll die,
then you'll have nothing.

1326
01:40:31,774 --> 01:40:34,911
Perhaps I am psychotic,
but I'm certainly not stupid.

1327
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:38,381
If I smash this,
I wouldn't die, Mr. Barrett.

1328
01:40:40,417 --> 01:40:41,584
Why do you think
Baxter waited so long

1329
01:40:41,618 --> 01:40:43,953
before telling anyone
about the Satan Bug.

1330
01:40:43,986 --> 01:40:45,822
Why do you think
he was working nights?
Weekends?

1331
01:40:45,855 --> 01:40:47,157
The vaccine!

1332
01:40:48,391 --> 01:40:50,693
Well, I waited for
the vaccine.

1333
01:40:50,727 --> 01:40:53,863
Two days ago he made it,
that's why he had
to die and Ostrer.

1334
01:40:53,896 --> 01:40:55,965
You were wrong
about him, too.

1335
01:40:55,998 --> 01:40:57,734
He didn't suspect me.
He didn't suspect anyone.

1336
01:40:57,767 --> 01:40:59,469
He just knew
about the vaccine

1337
01:40:59,502 --> 01:41:02,105
and now I'm the only one
who has the formula.

1338
01:41:02,139 --> 01:41:04,207
And the vaccine is
in my bloodstream.

1339
01:41:04,241 --> 01:41:06,176
I'm immune!
I won't die, I'm immune!

1340
01:41:06,743 --> 01:41:10,046
But you told us
what the Satan Bug would do.

1341
01:41:10,079 --> 01:41:14,651
You mean to say that you'd
live on this world alone?
By yourself?

1342
01:41:14,684 --> 01:41:17,654
I told you about
the Satan Bug to keep you
from finding Baxter.

1343
01:41:17,687 --> 01:41:19,856
Even so,
he believed every word I said.

1344
01:41:19,889 --> 01:41:23,460
But I'm not sure
how good a biochemist he was.

1345
01:41:23,493 --> 01:41:25,928
Some scientists thought
that the H-bomb would
start a chain reaction

1346
01:41:25,962 --> 01:41:29,632
that would blow up the world,
but it didn't.

1347
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:31,834
Now, nobody really knows
about this.

1348
01:41:31,868 --> 01:41:33,970
Theoretically, yes.

1349
01:41:34,003 --> 01:41:37,507
But it hasn't yet
been put to the real test.

1350
01:41:37,540 --> 01:41:40,677
Perhaps it will
destroy all life.

1351
01:41:40,710 --> 01:41:42,212
Perhaps.

1352
01:41:42,245 --> 01:41:44,381
Certainly it could
destroy millions.

1353
01:41:45,982 --> 01:41:47,884
Do you want to test it?

1354
01:42:04,267 --> 01:42:05,768
Mr. Ainsley?
Yes.

1355
01:42:09,372 --> 01:42:11,107
I was watching for you
and saw the car stop.

1356
01:42:11,140 --> 01:42:13,109
Thought I'd better
pick you up here.

1357
01:42:13,142 --> 01:42:16,946
The engine failed.
Don't worry about it,
we'll take off immediately.

1358
01:42:16,979 --> 01:42:18,381
Yes, sir.

1359
01:42:19,449 --> 01:42:21,651
Any trouble, Mr. Ainsley?
No, no.

1360
01:42:28,258 --> 01:42:29,058
Well, Mr. Barrett?

1361
01:42:29,091 --> 01:42:31,261
The flask is still in
Los Angeles.

1362
01:43:24,347 --> 01:43:26,683
Still nothing?
I'm afraid not, sir.

1363
01:43:26,716 --> 01:43:28,485
Nothing on Los Angeles,
nothing at all?

1364
01:43:28,518 --> 01:43:29,686
Nothing of any consequence.

1366
01:43:31,288 --> 01:43:32,489
Hello.

1367
01:43:32,522 --> 01:43:34,291
Only two tie-ups
to Los Angeles.

1368
01:43:34,324 --> 01:43:36,426
One of them is
an office building, here.
Where?

1369
01:43:36,459 --> 01:43:38,628
Ten stories high,
we've got men
going through them.

1370
01:43:38,661 --> 01:43:39,996
Starting from the top.

1371
01:43:40,029 --> 01:43:43,733
Now, the only other thing
is this little notation
in red ink.

1372
01:43:43,766 --> 01:43:45,368
Glendale 73.

1373
01:43:45,402 --> 01:43:47,570
We've got men calling
on every house with 73,

1374
01:43:47,604 --> 01:43:49,506
every phone number
beginning with 73,

1375
01:43:49,539 --> 01:43:51,841
every cab, well,
you get the idea, sir.

1376
01:43:51,874 --> 01:43:53,710
Yes.

1377
01:43:53,743 --> 01:43:57,246
Veretti did that,
he was doodling while
they were waiting for Hoffman.

1378
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,115
Hold on, Jack,
take this.

1379
01:44:00,317 --> 01:44:02,051
Well, they found
the green car.

1380
01:44:02,084 --> 01:44:04,387
Where?
It was abandoned
in front of a restaurant

1381
01:44:04,421 --> 01:44:06,689
next to a service station
near Palmdale.

1382
01:44:06,723 --> 01:44:07,857
They were both closed,

1383
01:44:07,890 --> 01:44:09,692
but a watchman in
a gravel yard
across the street

1384
01:44:09,726 --> 01:44:12,662
saw the green car park
and two men get out.

1385
01:44:12,695 --> 01:44:15,064
He described
Hoffman perfectly.

1386
01:44:15,097 --> 01:44:15,665
And the other man?

1387
01:44:15,698 --> 01:44:18,100
It sounds like Barrett.

1388
01:44:18,134 --> 01:44:19,602
Well, what happened to them?

1389
01:44:19,636 --> 01:44:21,971
There were two other men
waiting in a black car.

1390
01:44:22,004 --> 01:44:23,640
They held guns
on the first two.

1391
01:44:23,673 --> 01:44:26,242
Then they got in the black car
and all four drove off.

1392
01:44:26,275 --> 01:44:27,877
Didn't the night watchman
try to stop them?

1393
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:29,111
No.

1394
01:44:29,712 --> 01:44:31,213
God!

1395
01:44:31,247 --> 01:44:33,450
There's something else.

1396
01:44:33,483 --> 01:44:35,685
The watchman said
one of the men was
carrying something

1397
01:44:35,718 --> 01:44:37,854
that looked like
a small flask.

1398
01:44:40,022 --> 01:44:42,224
No license plate
on the black car?

1399
01:44:42,258 --> 01:44:44,093
Wrong angle,
couldn't see it.

1402
01:44:59,809 --> 01:45:02,945
This was doodled
by that maniac, Veretti.
Look at this.

1403
01:45:04,714 --> 01:45:05,114
That could be a flask.

1404
01:45:05,147 --> 01:45:07,083
It is a flask.

1405
01:45:08,985 --> 01:45:11,220
I think all these
are flasks.

1406
01:45:11,788 --> 01:45:13,990
That is something real.

1407
01:45:14,023 --> 01:45:17,494
He's unconsciously
trying to draw
or doodle something.

1408
01:45:17,527 --> 01:45:21,263
What is it?

1409
01:45:21,297 --> 01:45:25,201
Those lines look like
parking dividers
on a parking lot.

1410
01:45:26,836 --> 01:45:28,471

Nobody can.

any difference

to stop looking for Ainsley.

on the lookout for me.

1496
01:53:42,764 --> 01:53:45,434
and for God's sake
make a good landing.

01:53:45,467 --> 01:53:49,872
