1
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:24,654
Thanks. I'll see ya.
Yes, sir.

2
00:03:31,661 --> 00:03:34,631
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Raskin.

3
00:03:34,664 --> 00:03:36,566
I see you've got
the duty again.

4
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,202
You've been
back there a week.
It comes around.

5
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,804
Thanks.

6
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:56,886
Good night,
Dr. Ostrer.

7
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,154
Good night,
Reagan.

8
00:03:58,187 --> 00:03:59,623
Oh, Reagan.

9
00:04:05,228 --> 00:04:07,397
Reagan, I've gotta
talk to you.

10
00:04:07,431 --> 00:04:08,932
I've got a minute now.

11
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,701
No. But I want to see you
tomorrow morning.

12
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,171
I'll come by your house.
10:00?

13
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,540
Fine.

14
00:04:22,245 --> 00:04:25,749
What's this?
Laboratory equipment
replacements.

15
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:27,250
Well, what happened
while I was gone?

16
00:04:27,283 --> 00:04:28,818
Nothing, sir.

17
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:31,455
The Director?

18
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:33,590
Well, you know
Dr. Baxter,
he's still...

19
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,525
Introverted.

20
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:36,760
Yes, sir.

21
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,329
Who's left in E Lab?

22
00:04:39,363 --> 00:04:42,699
There's six,
Dr. Baxter, Hoffman, Yang,
and three technicians.

23
00:04:42,732 --> 00:04:44,267
GUARD: Correct.

24
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,603
Gonna get these inside?
Yes, sir.

25
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,282
Hello, Mr. Reagan.
Hello, Mason.

26
00:04:59,315 --> 00:05:00,717
Who's left in there?

27
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,388
Six, sir. Dr. Baxter,
Dr. Hoffman, Dr. Yang,
and three technicians.

28
00:05:25,409 --> 00:05:26,710
Dr. Hoffman.

29
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,311
Good evening, Reagan.

30
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:30,580
Is the Director in there?
Yes.

31
00:05:32,115 --> 00:05:33,783
Working late tonight?

32
00:05:34,117 --> 00:05:35,318
No.

33
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,868
Well, how was it
on the Potomac?

34
00:05:53,002 --> 00:05:56,473
Not quiet.

35
00:05:56,506 --> 00:06:00,176
I... I understand
the man has given us
a new administrator,

36
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:02,679
Dr. Leonard Michaelson?

37
00:06:03,547 --> 00:06:05,048
Who told you that?

38
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,818
Dr. Hoffman.

39
00:06:11,521 --> 00:06:13,790
The cleaning woman told him.

40
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,092
Not funny.

41
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:18,394
Well, it's Friday.

42
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,464
Good night, Reagan.
See you Monday.

43
00:06:20,497 --> 00:06:21,831
Good night, Doctor.

44
00:06:32,842 --> 00:06:35,745
Any trouble?
No, sir. Just some
minor residuals.

45
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:37,814
There's a couple of
crates outside.
Let's get 'em in.

46
00:06:37,847 --> 00:06:40,083
Yes, sir.
Raskin just called.

47
00:06:59,302 --> 00:07:00,904
Good evening, Doctor.

48
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,506
Oh.

49
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:04,974
What is it, Reagan?

50
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:08,512
Working late?

51
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:11,815
No. But I'll be
in tomorrow.

52
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,683
What time?
8:00.

53
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,186
I'll set the time lock
for you.

54
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,523
Last time you
locked yourself out
until Monday.

55
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:20,824
I know.

56
00:07:22,158 --> 00:07:23,860
You've been away,
haven't you?

57
00:07:23,893 --> 00:07:25,328
Washington.

58
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:29,098
How worried are they?

59
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:32,769
Well, they're always
worried about the security
of this place.

60
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:34,604
My job's like that.

61
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,174
What they're really
worried about is that.

62
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:39,876
Yes, sir.

63
00:07:41,578 --> 00:07:44,113
Did you, uh,
reassure them?

64
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:46,616
No. I leave that to you.

65
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:48,317
Yes.

66
00:07:51,755 --> 00:07:54,423
Sir, do you think...

67
00:07:54,457 --> 00:07:57,794
Why don't you
take this Saturday
and Sunday off, Doctor?

68
00:07:57,827 --> 00:07:59,395
Do you good.

69
00:07:59,428 --> 00:08:01,998
No time for that, Reagan.

70
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:03,933
No time.

71
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:08,938
Tired men
make mistakes, Doctor.

72
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:12,208
God help us
if a mistake's made here.

73
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,782
Goodnight, Doctor.

74
00:08:23,152 --> 00:08:24,353
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

75
00:08:24,387 --> 00:08:26,590
Good night, Mr. Reagan.
Good night.

76
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:38,401
Good night, Mason.
Good night, Mr. Reagan.

77
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:03,126
Good night,
Dr. Hoffman.

78
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:17,807
You are leaving, Doctor?

79
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,143
I'll be a few minutes.

80
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:24,948
Do you need me
for anything?

81
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,182
No.

82
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:28,752
Good night, Hoffman.

83
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:38,461
(SIGHING)

84
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,767
Goodnight, Dr. Hoffman.
Goodnight, Mason.

85
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,789
Good night, Doctor.

86
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:11,995
Good night, Doctor.

87

(AIR LOCK WHIRRING)

(PHONE RINGING)

89
00:11:33,977 --> 00:11:35,344
Mason speaking.

90
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:37,947
Is Doctor Williams in?

91
00:11:37,981 --> 00:11:40,216
MASON: Dr. Williams
is not in E Lab.

92
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,719
Good night,
Dr. Baxter.

93
00:11:43,753 --> 00:11:46,756
Two sixteen.
That's administration.

94
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,792
You're welcome.

95
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,280
It's Mason.
E Lab clear and closed.

96
00:12:12,215 --> 00:12:13,216
Right.

97
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:24,828
Good night,
Doctor Baxter.

98
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:32,468
Good night, Doctor.

99
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,059
Raskin.

100
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:58,161
Yes, sir.

101
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,563
Reagan.
I'm going into E Lab.

102
00:14:18,174 --> 00:14:20,176
The shoulder on
that back road's caved in.

103
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:22,946
We ought to
take care of that tomorrow.
All right.

104
00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:25,648
Might as well make
a note of it in the log
for Mr. Reagan in the morning.

105
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:27,416
I'll tell him
when he leaves.

106
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:30,386
He's still here?
Mmm-hmm. E Lab.

107
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:34,690
What time
did he go in there?

108
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,267
Mr. Reagan.

109
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:48,972
Mr. Reagan.

110
00:14:52,075 --> 00:14:54,577
RASKIN ON PA:
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

111
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,914
Hello, Mr. Reagan?

112
00:15:05,788 --> 00:15:08,124
Get over there
and check that
security door.

113
00:15:16,565 --> 00:15:19,868
This is Lieutenant Raskin,
Duty Officer, Station Three.

114
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:24,407
Get me the Director,
Dr. Baxter, at home,
or Mr. Tasserly. Right.

115
00:15:25,408 --> 00:15:27,876
(BAND PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC)

116
00:15:48,731 --> 00:15:50,566
There's a phone call for you.
What?

117
00:15:50,599 --> 00:15:51,867
There's a phone call for you.

118
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,536
Thank you, very much.

119
00:16:09,818 --> 00:16:12,721
Hello. Who?

120
00:16:14,457 --> 00:16:19,062
Okay, put him on.
Yes. Mr. Martin?

121
00:16:19,095 --> 00:16:21,997
Well, I could, but I don't
particularly want to.

122
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:26,269
Yeah. All right.
I hope it's as vital to me.

123
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:07,076
Mr. Martin?
Yes.

124
00:17:08,911 --> 00:17:10,413
Good evening.

125
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,648
Good of you to see me
at such a late hour,
Mr. Barrett.

126
00:17:12,681 --> 00:17:15,484
You didn't care
for a drink?
Oh, no, thank you.

127
00:17:15,518 --> 00:17:18,487
Do you live aboard
all the time, Mr. Barrett?

128
00:17:18,521 --> 00:17:20,189
No, just some of the time.

129
00:17:20,223 --> 00:17:24,493
I don't imagine
your law practice is
too demanding these days.

130
00:17:24,527 --> 00:17:26,529
Could be better.

131
00:17:26,562 --> 00:17:29,898
Yet, you can
afford this yacht.
Must be rather expensive.

132
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,902
What can I do for you,
Mr. Martin?

133
00:17:35,104 --> 00:17:37,973
We have a job for you.
We think you're the right man.

134
00:17:38,006 --> 00:17:40,209
Oh? Why?

135
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,378
You have the background
for it.

136
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:46,915
And in the past,
you've been quite outspoken
on the immorality of war.

137
00:17:46,949 --> 00:17:48,984
Everybody says
he's against war.

138
00:17:49,017 --> 00:17:52,955
Not ex-United States
Intelligence Officers.

139
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,958
Let's take a look
at some of the record.

140
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:59,695
"Lee Barrett.
1950. University student.
Pre law."

141
00:17:59,728 --> 00:18:01,597
"Then active service,
Korea and helicopters."

142
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:04,300
"Detached for special service.
Excellent war record."

143
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,070
"Citation.
Superb lone operator
who has no master in cunning,"

144
00:18:08,103 --> 00:18:09,805
"secrecy or violence."

145
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,709
"Promoted to captain.
Recommended for
three decorations."

146
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:15,711
First discordant note.
Last two refused.

147
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:19,582
You are quoted
as saying that war

148
00:18:19,615 --> 00:18:23,586
"had aged you so fast,
you were too old
to play with toys."

149
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:27,390
Rather a whimsical statement,
Mr. Barrett.

150
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:29,091
You think so?

151
00:18:29,124 --> 00:18:31,294
Why did you
leave the service?

152
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:32,728
Poor prospects.

153
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:37,500
Discharged, 1952.

154
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:42,271
Allowed to resign commission
after altercation with
a Major General.

155
00:18:42,305 --> 00:18:44,440
Some people
have flat feet.

156
00:18:44,473 --> 00:18:47,876
I dislike taking orders
under certain circumstances.

157
00:18:49,912 --> 00:18:54,317
Then you got your law degree.
Passed the bar examination,
but didn't practice.

158
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,652
Joined a government agency.

159
00:18:56,985 --> 00:18:58,321
Fired.

160
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:02,358
A stint with another one.
Fired for the usual reason.

161
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:04,960
You rate rather high
on insubordination.

162
00:19:04,993 --> 00:19:07,996
My record is easy to check,
Mr. Martin. Make your point.

163
00:19:09,632 --> 00:19:13,068
A year ago you were
appointed Security Chief
at Station Three.

164
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,371
How do you know
about Station Three?

165
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:19,141
The most secret
chemical warfare establishment
in this hemisphere.

166
00:19:20,809 --> 00:19:22,978
Fired three months ago.

167
00:19:23,011 --> 00:19:28,116
Reason? "Emotional rejection
of purpose of project."

168
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:32,921
"Council for World Peace."

169
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:34,957
"Henry Martin,
Executive Secretary."

170
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,191
You heard of us?

171
00:19:36,225 --> 00:19:37,526
Oh, yes.

172
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,528
MARTIN ON RADIO:
But you don't approve of us?

173
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:42,064
BARRETT: I don't like
semi-secret organizations,
Mr. Martin.

174
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,966
Neither do I,
Mr. Barrett.

175
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,135
But the Council is
a potent weapon for peace.

176
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:50,673
We're not communistic
or anti-communistic.

177
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,876
You just want
a workable peace.

178
00:19:53,909 --> 00:19:56,679
Like you, perhaps,
Mr. Barrett.

179
00:19:56,712 --> 00:20:00,616
You have been outspoken
on the foolishness of war.

180
00:20:04,086 --> 00:20:06,789
That was removed
from Station Three
a few hours ago.

181
00:20:06,822 --> 00:20:09,658
It doesn't matter
how at the moment.

182
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,860
Do you know
what it is?

183
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,299
Botulinus?

184
00:20:16,332 --> 00:20:18,066
No.

185
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,803
A vaccine
against botulinus.

186
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:26,208
The contents of
that flask can be cultured
to provide enough vaccine

187
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:28,477
to immunize
any nation on Earth.

188
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:32,448
We want it delivered
to this address.

189
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,554
Europe?
Yes.

190
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:41,023
How does that help peace?

191
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:44,393
It neutralizes
a terrible weapon.

192
00:20:44,427 --> 00:20:48,764
If we both have it, well,
neither side can threaten
the other with it.

193
00:20:50,466 --> 00:20:52,935
Very dangerous assignment,
Mr. Martin.

194
00:20:55,404 --> 00:21:00,108
$10,000 should cover
your expenses.

195
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:03,579
I'm afraid not.

196
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:04,947
Then you refuse?

197
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:06,482
No.

198
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:12,287
It'll cost you 20,000.
10,000 each way. Cash. Now.

199
00:21:12,321 --> 00:21:14,390
You mind if I say something,
Mr. Barrett?

200
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:15,891
Yes, I do.

201
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,192
Keep your speeches
and moralities
for your council.

202
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:18,361
This is a business deal.

203
00:21:18,394 --> 00:21:21,364
No wonder you were
thrown out of
so many places.

204
00:21:22,965 --> 00:21:24,166
Satisfied?

205
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,334
Yes.

206
00:21:27,102 --> 00:21:29,338
Put your forearms
on the table.

207
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:32,107
You have a strange way
of doing business,
Mr. Barrett.

208
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,742
What is this?
A holdup?

209
00:21:33,776 --> 00:21:35,844
Put your forearms
on the table.

210
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,815
First, vaccines
are not stored
at Station Three.

211
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:42,150
So this has got to be
some kind of a virus.

212
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:45,187
Second, no one's
supposed to know anything
about Station Three.

213
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,124
And third,
I know quite a bit about
the World Peace Organization.

214
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:52,695
There's a fat, balding man
who is the secretary,
name, Henry Martin.

215
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,397
I know him.

216
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,198
What do you
intend to do?

217
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,867
Turn you over
to the right people.

218
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:02,037
I know this isn't evidence,

219
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,308
but with your fingerprints
on the flask, and the money,
it'll do.

220
00:22:06,341 --> 00:22:07,910
MARTIN: I guess
I underestimated you.

221
00:22:07,943 --> 00:22:09,678
I guess you did.
Now, stand up.

222
00:22:09,712 --> 00:22:12,981
Turn around, put your hands on
the bulkhead and lean on them.

223
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,599
(FOOTSTEPS)

224
00:22:37,239 --> 00:22:38,741
Cavanaugh? What the hell
are you doing here?

225
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,776
Now, don't get sore, Barrett.
I had to do this in a hurry,

226
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:42,177
and it's the only way
I could handle it.

227
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,178
Handle what?

228
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,981
I had to check you
for security and quick.

229
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:50,486
That character's
one of your agents?
That's right.

230
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:52,955
And you planned this
whole thing just to see
if I could be bought?

231
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:54,957
You could put it
that way, I guess.

232
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,092
I didn't know what kind of
a security risk you'd become.

233
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,627
People change, you know.

234
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:02,097
You did have me worried
on that radio there
for a moment.

235
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,232
Get out of here
and get your tail back
to Washington.

236
00:23:04,266 --> 00:23:05,868
Mr. Barrett,
I'm Dr. Leonard Michaelson.

237
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,103
I know who you are.
You, too. Get out.

238
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:10,673
Get your props
and get off this boat.

239
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:13,509
Barrett, you know the way
our security agency works.

240
00:23:13,542 --> 00:23:15,878
Mr. Barrett, I can understand
how you might interpret this

241
00:23:15,911 --> 00:23:18,213
as a reflection
on your loyalty...
Sir.

242
00:23:18,246 --> 00:23:21,183
Barrett, the General has asked
that we come to you.

243
00:23:22,785 --> 00:23:24,453
He wants you
in on this.

244
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:27,189
In on what?

245
00:23:27,222 --> 00:23:30,325
Station Three was broken into
a few hours ago.

246
00:23:30,358 --> 00:23:33,596
Reagan's been murdered
and Dr. Baxter has vanished.

247
00:23:58,086 --> 00:23:59,588
Mr. Michaelson?
Right.

248
00:23:59,622 --> 00:24:02,357
I'm Pelton Tasserly,
Deputy Administrator here.
Mr. Tasserly.

249
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,059
Lieutenant Raskin.
Lieutenant Johnson.

250
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:05,928
Good morning.
I'm very sorry
about this, sir.

251
00:24:05,961 --> 00:24:07,295
No sooner take over and...
Yes, yes, Tasserly.

252
00:24:07,329 --> 00:24:09,431
You know Mr. Cavanaugh?
Yes, I do.

253
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:12,167
Mr. Barrett?
Hello, Barrett.

254
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,435
Anything on Baxter?

255
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,738
Nothing. But the net's out.
All points.

256
00:24:15,771 --> 00:24:17,005
What steps have you taken?

257
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,841
None, really. I figured
you'd get here pretty fast.

258
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,043
So I've touched nothing,
talked to no one.

259
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:23,679
I did bring in
all the security people
who were on duty last night.

260
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:26,114
Whom have you
told about this,
Mr. Tasserly?

261
00:24:26,148 --> 00:24:28,016
Well, no one,
other than you people,

262
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,484
and our security men,
of course.

263
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:31,987
And Doctor Hoffman.
Why him?

264
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,089
Well, he was the last one out,
except for the Director.

265
00:24:34,122 --> 00:24:35,958
He's waiting
in E block now.

266
00:24:35,991 --> 00:24:37,860
Let's take
a look at Reagan.

267
00:24:46,669 --> 00:24:48,403
Are you with us,
Barrett?

268
00:24:48,436 --> 00:24:50,105
I'll be there
in a minute.

269
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,681
How do you see this,
Johnson?

270
00:24:58,714 --> 00:25:03,986
Well, Mr. Tasserly says,
and Mason swears that
nobody got into E Lab.

271
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:06,288
But I don't think Reagan
committed suicide in there.

272
00:25:06,321 --> 00:25:08,724
Neither do I.
What's the sentry dog
doing over here?

273
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,126
He's got a lump on his head
that wasn't there yesterday.

274
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:14,597
But he was still on patrol
this morning?
Mmm-hmm.

275
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,600
I think maybe
he might've been
knocked cold for awhile.

276
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:20,669
Of course, being a dog,
he couldn't tell me about it.
He just went back to work.

277
00:25:20,703 --> 00:25:22,270
Yeah.

278
00:25:22,304 --> 00:25:24,072
Has Raskin got men
going over the fence?

279
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:25,574
Every inch.

280
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:39,054
Right in that corner, sir.

281
00:25:50,198 --> 00:25:53,669
Dr. Hoffman's
terribly distraught.
Insists he must talk to you.

282
00:25:53,702 --> 00:25:55,270
Immediately, in private.

283
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,072
Perhaps you should
see him, sir.

284
00:25:57,105 --> 00:25:58,406
Hmm.

285
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:03,712
Dr. Hoffman,
this is Dr. Michaelson.

286
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,695
How was it done?

287
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:21,529
Blow on the head.
No weapon.

288
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,132
Who set the time lock?

289
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,468
I don't know, sir.
I suppose Dr. Baxter.

290
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,570
Another half an hour to go.

291
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:30,172
Is there any way
to work that combination

292
00:26:30,205 --> 00:26:32,140
and go in before
the time is up?

293
00:26:32,174 --> 00:26:34,009
We've got to find out
if anything has
happened in there.

294
00:26:34,042 --> 00:26:37,079
No way on earth
until those red lights
go off at 8:00.

295
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:40,148
You fool with that
door before that,
well, you'd die quick.

296
00:26:40,182 --> 00:26:43,318
It's booby trapped.
A thousand volt charge
and lethal gas.

297
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:45,053
JOHNSON ON PA: Mr. Raskin.
Yes?

298
00:26:45,087 --> 00:26:46,588
We've found
a break in the fence.

299
00:26:46,621 --> 00:26:48,724
Don't touch it.
We'll be right there.
Yes, sir.

300
00:26:48,757 --> 00:26:50,492
CAVANAUGH: Raskin,
have your men
move Reagan's body

301
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,794
to one of
the side laboratories.

302
00:26:51,827 --> 00:26:53,128
RASKIN: Yes, sir.

303
00:26:58,233 --> 00:26:59,768
CAVANAUGH: Taped.

304
00:26:59,802 --> 00:27:01,603
So that you
can't even see it
unless you look closely.

305
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:04,272
Very careful job.

306
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,208
Raskin, open
the other side.

307
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:11,246
Cut left to right.
A right-handed man, maybe.

308
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,017
Or a left-handed man
who wants us to think
he's right-handed, maybe.

309
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:24,559
The alarm didn't go off.
The wire hasn't been
touched anywhere.

310
00:27:24,592 --> 00:27:26,428
Someone'd really have to know
their way around this place

311
00:27:26,461 --> 00:27:28,463
not to trip over this
at night.

312
00:27:29,331 --> 00:27:30,265
RASKIN: The thing
I don't understand,

313
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,434
is how anybody
can get past the dog.

314
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,869
I don't get that, either.

315
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,104
What do you
think happened?

316
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:37,272
I don't know, sir.

317
00:27:37,305 --> 00:27:38,741
BARRETT: What's his name?
Rollo.

318
00:27:38,774 --> 00:27:41,944
Can I handle him?
He's under sedation.
Go ahead.

319
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:48,116
Easy, Rollo.
Easy, boy.
Easy, Rollo.

320
00:27:48,717 --> 00:27:50,685
Easy. Easy.

321
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,154
(WHIMPERING)

322
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:52,888
There it is.

323
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,723
What do you
make of that?

324
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,958
Hmm.

325
00:27:59,027 --> 00:28:01,563
Those are cuts.
How'd they get there?

326
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,831
CAVANAUGH: From the wire.

327
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:03,899
Right.

328
00:28:05,133 --> 00:28:07,135
Raskin, you be Rollo.

329
00:28:09,905 --> 00:28:12,474
Now, you tape up your arm,
stick it through, thus...

330
00:28:12,507 --> 00:28:14,142
Okay, grab it.

331
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:17,512
You hang up Rollo
on the wires
so he can't pull free

332
00:28:17,545 --> 00:28:18,981
without tearing
his throat out.

333
00:28:19,014 --> 00:28:21,316
CAVANAUGH: He'd make a noise.
No. These dogs are trained
not to bark.

334
00:28:21,349 --> 00:28:22,317
No matter what. Right?
JOHNSON: Right.

335
00:28:22,350 --> 00:28:24,419
Then you clobber him
with something heavy,

336
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:27,089
you tape up the wire
and you're gone.

337
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,758
When Rollo comes to,
he's got the world's
most massive headache.

338
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:32,060
But being a dog,
he can't tell anybody

339
00:28:32,094 --> 00:28:34,362
so he just goes
back to work. Simple.

340
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:36,331
So that's how he got in.

341
00:28:36,364 --> 00:28:38,500
BARRETT: No.
That's how he got out.
Out?

342
00:28:38,533 --> 00:28:40,302
Right. Look at the ends
of these wires
where they're bent.

343
00:28:40,335 --> 00:28:42,470
He took Rollo
from the inside.

344
00:28:44,539 --> 00:28:48,010
Mr. Barrett,
a telegram for you.
It came to our office in town.

345
00:28:48,043 --> 00:28:50,012
How come you get
a telegram here?

346
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:51,046
Magic.

347
00:28:53,782 --> 00:28:55,784
I'd certainly like to know
what it says.

348
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,319
I'll bet you would.

349
00:28:57,352 --> 00:28:59,955
Mr. Cavanaugh,
it's 10 minutes to 8:00.

350
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:04,793
I know it is
an outside possibility,

351
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,462
but it is a possibility
and a horrible one.

352
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:11,299
And you cannot just
kick it under the rug.
You have not the right...

353
00:29:14,269 --> 00:29:16,438
CAVANAUGH: What is it?

354
00:29:16,471 --> 00:29:19,474
We have a very difficult
situation here.

355
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:22,377
Dr. Hoffman feels
that E Lab should be
sealed in concrete.

356
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,711
Why?

357
00:29:23,745 --> 00:29:26,414
Because he's afraid
that some chemicals
in that vault

358
00:29:26,448 --> 00:29:28,150
may have been
broken or tampered with.

359
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,919
Even if they weren't,
we still cannot
take the chance.

360
00:29:30,953 --> 00:29:34,056
The possibilities are
too monstrous to gamble with.

361
00:29:34,089 --> 00:29:36,191
What possibilities?

362
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,163
I think you better
tell them, Doctor.

363
00:29:41,196 --> 00:29:43,966
(SIGHING)

364
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:49,337
More than 40
bio-chemical weapons have been
developed at Station Three.

365
00:29:49,371 --> 00:29:53,508
I will confine myself
to two which we have
developed here in E Lab.

366
00:29:53,942 --> 00:29:56,411
First, botulinus.

367
00:29:56,444 --> 00:30:00,015
We have 1,200 grams
in six flasks.

368
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,018
If 10 grams of it
were allowed to
contaminate a city,

369
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,153
that city is a morgue
in four hours.

370
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:11,593
It is an ideal weapon,
God forgive the phrase,

371
00:30:11,626 --> 00:30:14,696
because it destroys
only people.

372
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:20,635
And it oxidizes itself.
In effect, dies, disappears
after eight hours.

373
00:30:20,668 --> 00:30:22,137
Well, then,
it's safe to go in there.

374
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,073
It's been over eight hours
since that vault door
was closed.

375
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:27,775
And if all 1,200 grams of
the botulinus were spilled
on the floor,

376
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:30,312
it would still be safe.

377
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:34,116
The closed air circulating
system is still in operation.
So it would be oxidized.

378
00:30:34,149 --> 00:30:38,820
That is correct. But there is
something else in there.

379
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:43,625
It is only three weeks
since Dr. Baxter refined it
and only three days

380
00:30:43,658 --> 00:30:46,995
since he communicated
its existence to anyone.

381
00:30:47,029 --> 00:30:49,864
There's something beyond
the botulinus?

382
00:30:49,898 --> 00:30:52,634
Yes, the second weapon.

383
00:30:52,667 --> 00:30:55,270
Also a virus, air borne.

384
00:30:55,303 --> 00:30:58,773
But self-perpetuating.
Indestructible.

385
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:03,045
Once released, it will
multiply at a power
beyond our calculations.

386
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:06,114
It perhaps, will never die.

387
00:31:06,148 --> 00:31:09,851
To this virus, we have given
a highly unscientific name,

388
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:13,255
but one which
describes it perfectly.

389
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,090
The Satan Bug.

390
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:20,195
If I took the flask
which contains it
and exposed it to the air,

391
00:31:20,228 --> 00:31:22,965
everyone here
would be dead
in a few seconds.

392
00:31:22,998 --> 00:31:26,001
California would be a tomb
in a few hours.

393
00:31:26,668 --> 00:31:28,536
In a week,

394
00:31:28,570 --> 00:31:31,706
all life,
and I mean all life,

395
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,776
would cease
in the United States.

396
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,845
In two months,
two months at the most,

397
00:31:37,879 --> 00:31:41,083
the trapper in Alaska,
the peasant on the Yangtze,

398
00:31:41,116 --> 00:31:43,151
the aborigine in Australia,
dead.

399
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:45,287
All dead.

400
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:51,059
Because I crushed the flask
and exposed a green
colored liquid to the air.

401
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:54,329
Nothing, nothing can stop
the Satan Bug.

402
00:31:54,362 --> 00:31:57,299
What would be
the last to go?

403
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:02,037
Perhaps a great albatross
winging it's way around
the bottom of the world.

404
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,439
Perhaps an Eskimo
deep in the Arctic.

405
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:10,178
But the seas travel
the world over
and so do the winds.

406
00:32:10,212 --> 00:32:13,681
One day, one day soon,
they, too, would die.

407
00:32:14,983 --> 00:32:17,019
The Satan Bug is
behind that door.

408
00:32:17,052 --> 00:32:21,056
One flask.
It has got to be locked up.
It has got to be.

409
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:23,258
I must make you understand.

410
00:32:23,291 --> 00:32:25,660
If botulinus is spilled,
as Mr. Barrett here
has just said,

411
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:27,695
then it does not matter.

412
00:32:27,729 --> 00:32:30,898
But, by God,
if someone did
get in there,

413
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:34,236
and the Satan Bug is spilled,
and the vault door
opened half an inch

414
00:32:34,269 --> 00:32:37,972
and left open,
then the airlock room
is lethal.

415
00:32:38,006 --> 00:32:41,143
Open this door for more than
five seconds

416
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:45,513
and everything
that I have told you
will happen, will happen.

417
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,750
I beg you, sir,
seal up the door.
You cannot take the risk.

418
00:32:51,353 --> 00:32:54,089
I agree. There's
nothing else we can do.

419
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:55,423
We've no option.

420
00:32:55,457 --> 00:32:58,960
We've no option,
but to make sure
it's in there and untouched.

421
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,397
(SQUEAKING)

422
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,501
All right,
you're all set.

423
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:16,411
Barrett,
if that hamster does die,
you'll be contaminated.

424
00:33:16,444 --> 00:33:19,581
You won't be able
to come out of there.

425
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:20,582
I know.

426
00:33:20,615 --> 00:33:21,683
Well, I trust your intentions,

427
00:33:21,716 --> 00:33:24,752
but if there is
something wrong in there, I...

428
00:33:24,786 --> 00:33:27,789
You wonder if I can
go through staying in there?

429
00:33:27,822 --> 00:33:29,724
Yes.
So do I.

430
00:33:31,293 --> 00:33:33,095
Eric, do you have your gun?

431
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:35,797
If I come out of that vault
with this face mask down,

432
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,766
open that airlock door
just a crack and use it.

433
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,268
It's below atmospheric
pressure in there,

434
00:33:40,302 --> 00:33:42,604
so the outside air
will rush in.

435
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:47,075
You'll have time.
You'll be safe.

436
00:33:47,109 --> 00:33:49,644
Lee, you know
if I have to,
I will use this.

437
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:51,446
I know.

438
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:16,371
(AIR LOCK WHIRRING)

There's no danger.

442

Baxter's in there.
He's dead.

(SQUEAKING)

Botulinus.

445
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:17,118
There was
a accident last month,
a technician.

446
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,386
Oh, no, it is all right.

447
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:21,489
There's just the odor now.
It's oxidized.

448
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,692
What about
the Satan Bug, Dr. Hoffman?

449
00:37:28,896 --> 00:37:32,434
Don't touch
the handle, Doctor.
We need fingerprints.

450
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:45,547
It is gone.

451
00:37:46,247 --> 00:37:48,282
And the botulinus.

452
00:37:48,316 --> 00:37:52,554
All the flasks.
Yes. They are all gone.

453
00:37:52,587 --> 00:37:56,691
It can't be gone.
It can't be.
It's impossible.

454
00:37:56,724 --> 00:37:58,393
Baxter walked out
last night.

455
00:37:58,426 --> 00:37:59,761
He was checked out. He was!

456
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:01,329

walked out.

457

Good morning.
Good morning.
I'm Lee Barrett.

458

Oh, yes, Mr. Barrett.
You're in suite 15.

459
00:38:42,704 --> 00:38:44,372
I am?
Yes, sir.

460
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:48,242
You're already registered.

461
00:38:48,275 --> 00:38:49,777
I am?
You certainly are.

462
00:38:49,811 --> 00:38:51,779
Hello, Lee, darling.

463
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:58,553
Thank you, very much.

464
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,921
Don't mention it.

465
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,658
I thought you'd
never get here.

466

I've read the newspaper
three times and had
four cups of coffee.

00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:08,195
Well, I hope
you saved one for me.

468
00:39:08,229 --> 00:39:09,664
I certainly did.

469
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:18,406
What the hell
are you doing here?

470
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,775
I'm using a new strategy,
darling.

471
00:39:20,808 --> 00:39:24,311
I thought you might like
the Mata Hari type.

472
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,548
But that telegram,
"The sooner the better."

473
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:29,016
Can you think of a better way
to get you here fast?

474
00:39:29,050 --> 00:39:30,918
At least you
could've signed it, damn it.

475
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:33,988
Hey, your language
hasn't improved a bit,
by the way.

476
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:36,991
You need a wife's influence.

477
00:39:37,024 --> 00:39:39,193
Ann, honey,
what are you doing here?

478
00:39:39,226 --> 00:39:41,829
Isn't this a beautiful part
of the desert?

479
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:44,566
It's marvelous,
almost a hideaway.

480
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:46,233
Where is he?

481
00:39:46,267 --> 00:39:48,335
About 10 miles from here.

482
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:50,404
Well, who's the cover
this time?

483
00:39:50,705 --> 00:39:52,273
Me.

484
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,941
You?

485
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,177
You know, you're not
very bright this morning,
Lee, darling

486
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,312
and you're certainly not
a bit flattering.

487
00:39:58,345 --> 00:40:01,616
You and I are spending
a quiet little weekend here.

488
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,018
Supposedly.

489
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:05,787
Oh.

490
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:08,656
What is it this time, Lee?

491
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:11,425
It's not good.

492
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:12,827
Why didn't you say so?

493
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,396
I know a darling place
out in the desert for lunch.

494
00:40:15,429 --> 00:40:18,600
Green pepper burritos
and cold Mexican beer.

495
00:40:18,633 --> 00:40:19,801
Ole.

496
00:40:52,567 --> 00:40:55,503
Oh, hello, Ann, darling.
Good morning, Dad.

497
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,938
Good morning, sir.
Good to see you again.

498
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:58,806
Hello, Lee.
It's good to see you.
Sit down.

499
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,208
Thank you.
That's it for
romance today, Lee.

500
00:41:01,242 --> 00:41:02,577
I'll get your breakfast.
No, that can wait.

501
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:05,079
Sit down, Ann.
There's no reason
why you shouldn't hear this.

502
00:41:05,112 --> 00:41:07,014
It didn't take you
long to get here
from Washington.

503
00:41:07,048 --> 00:41:10,585
No. I'm a member of
the Mach two club now.
A little over two hours.

504
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:14,488
No, Ann came ahead of me.
I was going to talk to Baxter.

505
00:41:14,522 --> 00:41:16,658
We've just learned
of the Satan Bug.

506
00:41:16,691 --> 00:41:18,760
Baxter hadn't told you?

507
00:41:18,793 --> 00:41:22,530
No, not until three days ago.
He was quite disturbed.

508
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,667
So were all of us.
A difficult decision.

509
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:28,603
Didn't know what to do.
Destroy it or not.

510
00:41:31,338 --> 00:41:33,941
Is it gone?
Yes, sir.
And all the botulinus.

511
00:41:36,177 --> 00:41:37,612
And I warned him.

512
00:41:37,645 --> 00:41:40,648
You set a project
like this in motion,
something has to blow.

513
00:41:40,682 --> 00:41:41,949
You think Baxter took it?

514
00:41:41,983 --> 00:41:44,586
No, I found him in the lab.
He's dead.

515
00:41:45,553 --> 00:41:46,854
Baxter's dead?

516
00:41:46,888 --> 00:41:48,756
Somehow two men
got into E Lab yesterday.

517
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,826
They must've found
Baxter there alone,
just before closing.

518
00:41:51,859 --> 00:41:53,995
One of them
threw the flask at him
and then shut the vault door,

519
00:41:54,028 --> 00:41:56,063
then he walked out
as Baxter.

520
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,364
As Baxter?
There must've been

521
00:41:57,398 --> 00:42:00,568
a reasonable resemblance,
and with Baxter's hat
and coat,

522
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,236
everybody expected
to see Baxter.

523
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,304
So they saw Baxter.

524
00:42:03,337 --> 00:42:04,739
And?

525
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:07,174
The other man
went through the fence
with the stuff.

526
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:10,011
Reagan must've stumbled
on them in the lab.

527
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:15,950
Does Cavanaugh
have any ideas?

528
00:42:15,983 --> 00:42:17,218
None. But he's
all over the place

529
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:19,120
with fingerprint men
and cameras.

530
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:21,823
He'll interrogate everything,
everybody, but he won't
come up with anything

531
00:42:21,856 --> 00:42:23,591
that will be of any value.

532
00:42:24,491 --> 00:42:26,761
You agree
that it was an inside job?

533
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:29,096
Certainly an inside assist,
but too smooth to be caught

534
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,665
by fingerprints
and conversation.

535
00:42:30,698 --> 00:42:32,566
Anyhow, sir, as you know,

536
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,637
the "how" is not important,
it's the "who"
and the "why" that counts.

537
00:42:35,670 --> 00:42:36,638
Yes.

538
00:42:37,639 --> 00:42:39,073
Lee,

539
00:42:39,106 --> 00:42:42,176
have they told you
just what this
new virus will do?

540
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:43,911
Dr. Hoffman filled me in.

541
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:49,250
It's throwing that botulinus
that worries me.

542
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:50,752
That's the work
of a lunatic.

543
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:51,953
There're three
possibilities.

544
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,855
Foreign power, possible.

545
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:56,157
Criminals, hijackers,
improbable.

546
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:58,092
It's the first
and the third
that bother me.

547
00:42:58,125 --> 00:43:00,494
What's the third?
Well, you said it,
a lunatic.

548
00:43:00,527 --> 00:43:03,364
Well, psychotics
don't generally engage
in team work like this.

549
00:43:03,397 --> 00:43:06,233
Paranoids do,
and they're very brilliant,
some of them.

550
00:43:06,267 --> 00:43:07,969
What sort of paranoid?

551
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:10,137
The kind that we grow
the most of in this country.

552
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,438
A messiah.

553
00:43:11,472 --> 00:43:13,107
What kind of messiah?

554
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,475
Take your pick.

555
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,944
Extreme right,
extreme left.

556
00:43:16,978 --> 00:43:19,113
From the
"I'd rather be Red
than Dead" fanatics

557
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:21,916
to "Bomb Moscow
right now" fanatics.

558
00:43:21,949 --> 00:43:23,951
My choice, a messiah.

559
00:43:23,985 --> 00:43:26,353
Let's say you're right.
What next?

560
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:29,957
A telegram,
a letter, or something
to the papers with,

561
00:43:29,991 --> 00:43:33,695
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

562
00:43:33,728 --> 00:43:36,998
And they'll make demands
and end up with,
"Obey or else."

563
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,968
Where were you
at midnight last night?

564
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:44,071
I beg your pardon?

565
00:43:44,105 --> 00:43:46,774
This was delivered
about 10 minutes ago.

566
00:43:46,808 --> 00:43:51,813
"Mankind must abolish war,
or war will abolish mankind."

567
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:53,514
"I have what
you're looking for."

568
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,618
"I order your Citadel
of the Antichrist destroyed."

569
00:43:57,651 --> 00:44:01,555
"The President
will publicly announce
immediate compliance."

570
00:44:01,588 --> 00:44:05,559
"To prove that
I am to be obeyed,
there will be an incident."

571
00:44:05,592 --> 00:44:06,627
Unsigned.

572
00:44:26,881 --> 00:44:30,117
They were carried in.
Routine delivery of crates.

573
00:44:30,151 --> 00:44:31,652
Carried in!

574
00:44:31,685 --> 00:44:32,854
Phony.

575
00:44:32,887 --> 00:44:34,956
My God, Mr. Barrett,
we had no way of knowing.

576
00:44:34,989 --> 00:44:38,059
We had no idea
they'd do anything like this.
No idea at all. It's...

577
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:39,393
It's so simple
it's ridiculous.

578
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:41,395
It's always the simple way
that works.

579
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,529
Nothing?
MAN: Nothing.

580
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:44,165
Only the fingerprints
that belong here.

581
00:44:44,198 --> 00:44:47,935
The crates were coded
with the right number,
the right color.

582
00:44:47,969 --> 00:44:51,238
And they were delivered
late Friday afternoon,
at 5:35.

583
00:44:51,272 --> 00:44:53,074
No reason for the technicians
to open them.

584
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,241
Exactly.

585
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:55,977
We're just to see
that nothing gets out.

586
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,645
Nothing. Everything that
comes in stays...

587
00:44:58,679 --> 00:45:00,481
Eric.

588
00:45:05,152 --> 00:45:08,289
The General's here.
He got this this morning.

589
00:45:09,523 --> 00:45:12,093
It was phoned in last night.

590
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,895
Pay phone,
Los Angeles Airport.

591
00:45:16,097 --> 00:45:17,331
My God.

592
00:45:19,366 --> 00:45:21,235
How did they even know
he was here?

593
00:45:21,268 --> 00:45:23,737
Good question.

594
00:45:23,771 --> 00:45:26,607
Well, there's only
one thing to do.
Rip this whole place apart.

595
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,110
Get everybody in here.
Everyone else connected
with this place.

596
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:33,247
Work them over. Meanwhile,
we'll keep the whole area
completely sealed off.

597
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:35,349
I think, except for
sealing off the area,

598
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,919
we should do
the exact opposite.

599
00:45:37,952 --> 00:45:39,620
What do you mean?

600
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:43,090
Everybody here, at E Lab,
knows exactly what happened.

601
00:45:43,124 --> 00:45:45,692
Certainly whoever
took the bugs know.

602
00:45:45,726 --> 00:45:48,195
But nobody outside
knows anything yet.

603
00:45:48,229 --> 00:45:50,731
Keep it that way.
Leave it wide open.

604
00:45:50,764 --> 00:45:53,835
Why?
So we don't force
anybody underground.

605
00:45:53,868 --> 00:45:57,839
Eric, there's got to be
at least an inside assist
from someone here

606
00:45:57,872 --> 00:45:59,807
at Station Three.

607
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,943
Whoever it is,
let's keep them
in the dark.

608
00:46:01,976 --> 00:46:03,911
Let's hope they make
a move, and if they do,
we'll know it.

609
00:46:03,945 --> 00:46:06,547
It may be the break
we're looking for.

610
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:09,116
Pretty dangerous, Lee.
Lot of ways to make a slip.

611
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:12,153
You know how long it'll take
to interrogate everybody.

612
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:15,990
Cross check stories,
and run down leads.
We're under a time gun.

613
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:19,160
You cannot conduct this
like a normal investigation.

614
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:22,763
We've got to hope
that somebody, somehow,
will lead us to the bugs.

615
00:46:22,796 --> 00:46:26,200
Only the flasks are important,
nothing else.

616
00:46:26,233 --> 00:46:26,868
What do we say
about Baxter?

617
00:46:26,901 --> 00:46:27,701
Tell them nothing.

618
00:46:27,734 --> 00:46:30,437
What about this?
It doesn't exist.

619
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:34,441
(SIGHING)

620
00:46:36,243 --> 00:46:38,045
I'll give the word
to Raskin.

621
00:46:39,746 --> 00:46:40,915
CAVANAUGH: Raskin.

622
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,397
Anything, Mr. Barrett?

623
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:58,265
Mr. Cavanaugh will be in
in a moment.

624
00:46:58,299 --> 00:47:00,801
That was a very
brave thing you did,
Mr. Barrett.

625
00:47:00,834 --> 00:47:02,536
To go into that vault.

626
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:05,372
Maybe I knew
there wasn't any risk.
How could you know that?

627
00:47:05,406 --> 00:47:06,707
Well, certainly,
whoever planned this
had accurate information.

628
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:09,410
Very accurate information.

629
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:13,214
Like me you mean?
I'd put me at the top
of the list.

630
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,549
Why would you steal
the Satan Bug, Mr. Barrett?

631
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,119
Possession gives one
limitless power.

632
00:47:18,485 --> 00:47:19,720
Military power?

633
00:47:19,753 --> 00:47:22,356
And political power
and limitless wealth.

634
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:26,260
The Satan Bug could
make one god on earth,
or the devil, if you please.

635
00:47:26,293 --> 00:47:28,795
Isn't that enough
to tempt anyone?

636
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:30,297
Dr. Hoffman, how long
will it take us to develop

637
00:47:30,331 --> 00:47:32,900
a vaccine against
the Satan Bug?

638
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:36,270
As a scientist,
I cannot say never, but...

639
00:47:36,303 --> 00:47:40,074
Dr. Baxter was
not getting anywhere,
none of us were.

640
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:42,843
Tasserly,
institute a crash program.

641
00:47:42,876 --> 00:47:45,046
Now.
Yes, sir.

642
00:47:50,151 --> 00:47:52,219
Sir, except
for those present,

643
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:55,089
we're taking
the official position
that nothing is missing.

644
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:57,258
There's been a murder,
that's all.

645
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,692
We say nothing
to anyone.

646
00:47:58,725 --> 00:48:00,861
A murder?
What about Dr. Baxter?

647
00:48:00,894 --> 00:48:05,366
There's a dead body in there.
It'll keep till Monday.
Dr. Baxter's just missing.

648
00:48:05,399 --> 00:48:07,868
Meanwhile, of course,
we'll proceed with
the investigation.

649
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:10,071
How?
The usual way.

650
00:48:10,104 --> 00:48:12,373
What are we
supposed to do?

651
00:48:12,406 --> 00:48:15,576
What do you propose,
Mr. Tasserly?

652
00:48:15,609 --> 00:48:19,513
I think I will stay here
at Station Three,
if you do not object.

653
00:48:19,546 --> 00:48:22,549
I'm very tired,
and I do not feel
like going home.

654
00:48:22,583 --> 00:48:23,884
TASSERLY: I'll go with you.

655
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:25,953
Somehow, I...

656
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:27,521
Well, I should
like to be on call.

657
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:30,691
I will be in D Wing rest area.
Do not hesitate to awaken me.

658
00:48:30,724 --> 00:48:32,793
Very well.

659
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,595
The General is here,
Dr. Michaelson.

660
00:48:34,628 --> 00:48:38,132
All of this is being
transmitted to Washington
in detail.

661
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:41,102
All right. I'll be
in administration
with Tasserly.

662
00:48:42,136 --> 00:48:43,437
Station Three personnel?

663
00:48:43,470 --> 00:48:44,671
Yes.

664
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,209
That telegram.

665
00:48:48,242 --> 00:48:52,813
Could there have been a leak?
I mean, you don't think
it was a phony, do you?

666
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:57,018
It could be a maneuver.
The bugs are gone.

667
00:48:58,252 --> 00:49:01,422
A lunatic
with the killer of all times.

668
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,225
Gives me the creeps.

669
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,628
This whole operation
gives me the creeps.

670
00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:58,912
How was Florida?

671
00:49:58,945 --> 00:50:00,847
Okay.
Quick trip.

672
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:04,918
No quicker than
it was scheduled.

673
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:07,288
How'd you make out?

674
00:50:07,321 --> 00:50:09,223
I made out fine.

675
00:50:12,025 --> 00:50:13,160
Where's Ainsley?

676
00:50:13,194 --> 00:50:14,395
I don't know.

677
00:50:15,162 --> 00:50:16,497
When did he get here?

678
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:17,698
He didn't.

679
00:50:19,866 --> 00:50:21,235
What do you mean,
he didn't?

680
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,836
I mean
he didn't get here.

681
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,938
And he didn't call.

682
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,941
Did you call him?

683
00:50:27,974 --> 00:50:29,210
No, I didn't.

684
00:50:55,669 --> 00:50:57,471
(PHONE RINGING)

685
00:51:25,632 --> 00:51:27,168
Hello.

686
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:29,536
Yeah, this is
Dr. Ostrer's house.

687
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:33,174
Oh, I'm just
the air conditioning man.
I'm fixing the unit.

688
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:37,043
Well, he just stepped out.
He said he'd be right back.
Can I take a message?

689
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,946
To call who?

690
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,849
Ah, Ainsley?
How do you spell that?
A-N-S...

691
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:46,420
A-I-N-S-L-E-Y.

692
00:51:46,453 --> 00:51:49,290
Ah, that's right, Mr. Ainsley.
What number?

693
00:51:49,323 --> 00:51:50,891
(PHONE CLICKS)

694
00:52:02,002 --> 00:52:03,670
What the hell
are you doing here?

695
00:52:03,704 --> 00:52:06,640
Do you usually make
a habit of hanging around
people's swimming pools?

696
00:52:06,673 --> 00:52:08,442
I do when I see that.

697
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:27,594
Is that Ostrer?

698
00:52:27,628 --> 00:52:29,363
Yeah. They wiped him out.

699
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:34,067
Could he have been
the inside assist?

700
00:52:35,135 --> 00:52:36,703
Could be.

701
00:53:00,361 --> 00:53:02,429
Cavanaugh, please.

702
00:53:02,463 --> 00:53:06,400
Cavanaugh, Barrett here.
I'm at Ostrer's. He's dead.

703
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:09,270
It's murder to me,
but it looks like
it could be suicide.

704
00:53:09,303 --> 00:53:10,971
He's floating
at the bottom of the pool.

705
00:53:11,004 --> 00:53:13,840
I'll fill you in
on the details later,
but more important,

706
00:53:13,874 --> 00:53:17,378
see if you can check
a call that just came in
to this number a minute ago.

707
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:19,813
What does the name
Ainsley mean to you?

708
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:22,215
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

709
00:53:22,249 --> 00:53:24,751
Uh-huh. That's him.
Millionaire crank.

710
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:27,087
Right at the top of the list
of crackpots.

711
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,323
A place in New York,
Santa Barbara and another one,

712
00:53:29,356 --> 00:53:32,326
I think, somewhere outside
of Phoenix. Nail him.

713
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:34,395
Don't touch him,
but don't let him
out of your sight.

714
00:53:34,428 --> 00:53:37,798
And don't let him know
he's being followed. Okay.

715
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:42,068
Now, honey,
what are you doing here?

716
00:53:42,102 --> 00:53:43,704
I was looking for you.

717
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:46,206
The incident?

718
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,908
Florida.

719
00:53:53,514 --> 00:53:54,915
GENERAL: Well,
it's happened, Lee.

720
00:53:54,948 --> 00:53:57,618
Key West, Florida.
About an hour
and a half ago.

721
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,853
We have helicopters
in the area

722
00:53:59,886 --> 00:54:03,557
making 16 millimeter films
of everything they can see
from the air.

723
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,559
Meanwhile, the coast line
is blocked off

724
00:54:05,592 --> 00:54:09,229
and we're at the present time
clearing the ocean for
200 miles off shore.

725
00:54:09,262 --> 00:54:10,631
How'd it happen?

726
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,299
Nobody seems to know, exactly.

727
00:54:12,333 --> 00:54:14,335
One reports says
there was a small explosion.

728
00:54:14,368 --> 00:54:16,703
Then everyone downwind
started dying.

729
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:18,339
We've closed down
all the news media,

730
00:54:18,372 --> 00:54:20,907
but we won't be able to
keep it quiet for long.

731
00:54:20,941 --> 00:54:22,776
What's the attitude
in Washington?

732
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:25,846
I would describe it
as controlled panic.

733
00:54:25,879 --> 00:54:27,314
What do they expect
you to do?

734
00:54:27,348 --> 00:54:29,616
Find whoever it is.
Deal with him.

735
00:54:29,650 --> 00:54:31,618
Buy him off, kill him,
whatever's necessary.

736
00:54:31,652 --> 00:54:33,186
But meanwhile?

737
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:34,220
(PHONE RINGING)

738
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,357
Yes. Speaking.

739
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:40,226
Oh, are they clear?

740
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,297
That bad, huh?

741
00:54:45,131 --> 00:54:46,933
When will the film be here?

742
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:51,738
Well, yes,
he's here now.
I'll tell him.

743
00:54:51,772 --> 00:54:55,376
I'll get back to you
as soon as I've seen
the film. Goodbye.

744
00:54:55,409 --> 00:54:58,779
They have the film on Florida
and they're shipping
a print out here right away.

745
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:02,849
Cavanaugh tells me that
he and his staff have drawn
a complete blank.

746
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,652
They checked out
everything and everybody
in Station Three,

747
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:08,288
except Hoffman.
I want you to get on Hoffman.

748
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:11,257
And push Cavanaugh
on that Ainsley lead.
That's the only one we've got.

749
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:13,527
And we're not going to be
able to control this thing
very much longer.

750
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,028
Yes, sir.

751
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,331
Oh, that film is going to
arrive at Station Three
about 4:00.

752
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:21,067
Get it here
as soon as it arrives.

753
00:55:21,101 --> 00:55:23,570
Get me this number,
will you, Ann?

754
00:55:23,604 --> 00:55:25,772
Now, you left
the research center
in Zurich

755
00:55:25,806 --> 00:55:28,074
after you accepted
your position here.
Is that correct?

756
00:55:28,108 --> 00:55:33,179
Yes. But as you know,
I went on a four-week
motor tour before I reported.

757
00:55:33,213 --> 00:55:34,781
Reported to Washington?

758
00:55:34,815 --> 00:55:37,918
Yes. Well, actually,
to the United States Counsel
at Naples

759
00:55:37,951 --> 00:55:39,720
before I boarded the Da Vinci.

760
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,787
And that was in...

761
00:55:40,821 --> 00:55:43,990
That was five months ago.
The exact date was...

762
00:55:44,024 --> 00:55:45,592
Oh, I have it here.

763
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:49,195
You were out of touch
while touring?

764
00:55:49,229 --> 00:55:53,033
I had no set plans.
I motored through the Tyrol,
across the Brenner,

765
00:55:53,066 --> 00:55:58,238
Lake Lugano.
Naturally, if I had been
needed here immediately...

766
00:55:58,271 --> 00:56:03,043
It was a... It was kind of
therapeutic irresponsibility.

767
00:56:03,076 --> 00:56:05,446
Lee, we just got
the last word on Ainsley.

768
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:07,514
Looks like we're on target.

769
00:56:08,582 --> 00:56:09,950
Excuse me.

770
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:12,819
Mr. Barrett.

771
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:13,987
Yes?

772
00:56:15,756 --> 00:56:20,260
That bulletin over the radio
about the trouble in Florida,
the...

773
00:56:20,927 --> 00:56:22,295
It sounded as if...

774
00:56:22,328 --> 00:56:23,997
We think
it's the botulinus.

775
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:27,768
My God.
Why, Mr. Barrett?

776
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:28,835
We don't know.

777
00:56:28,869 --> 00:56:31,237
But for what purpose?

778
00:56:31,271 --> 00:56:33,640
We're trying to
find that out. Excuse me.

779
00:56:35,676 --> 00:56:37,210
He's disappeared.

780
00:56:37,243 --> 00:56:39,846
The Santa Barbara house
and the Phoenix place
have been closed for months.

781
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,048
He was last seen
in his New York place.

782
00:56:42,082 --> 00:56:44,117
How long ago was that?
Eight months.

783
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,953
We ran everybody
who ever said hello to him
through the wringer.

784
00:56:46,987 --> 00:56:48,154
His ex-housekeeper
in New York

785
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:50,857
said that he told her
he was going on a world tour.

786
00:56:50,891 --> 00:56:53,794
Somebody bought the tickets.
Travel agency must have
a schedule.

787
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:57,598
She said Ainsley is
not the kind of man
you ask questions of.

788
00:56:57,631 --> 00:56:59,432
Well, what does he look like?
We have any pictures?

789
00:56:59,466 --> 00:57:00,634
No.

790
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:02,536
There's no reason
for anybody to keep
a file on him.

791
00:57:02,569 --> 00:57:04,938
No pictures,
newspaper morgue,
no personal stuff?

792
00:57:04,971 --> 00:57:10,443
None. He's an eccentric.
No pictures, no relatives,
no public life.

793
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:12,378
Visual description
from all concerned.

794
00:57:12,412 --> 00:57:16,817
Age, 50-something.
Height, medium. Hair, brown.
Coloring, normal.

795
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,051
Distinguishing
characteristics, none.

796
00:57:18,084 --> 00:57:20,721
No other leads,
nothing?
No.

797
00:57:20,754 --> 00:57:24,257
If anybody could beat
any haystacks any flatter
than we have.

798
00:57:24,290 --> 00:57:28,028
Lee, look. He's the only name
that's dropped into this
from the outside.

799
00:57:28,061 --> 00:57:30,296
And he's vanished
from the face of the earth.

800
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:34,034
Everything we know about him
fits the man that
sent that telegram.

801
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:37,771
Lunatic fringe, crank,
rich, with resources.

802
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:39,840
Now, it's too much
to be a coincidence.

804
00:57:42,809 --> 00:57:44,410
Barrett here.

805
00:57:44,444 --> 00:57:46,446
Thank you.
The film is here.

806
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:54,454
I thought something
had happened when
I didn't hear from you.

807
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,456
What?

808
00:57:58,291 --> 00:57:59,492
I see.

809
00:58:00,827 --> 00:58:02,729
Everything's perfect here.

810
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:06,600
What?

811
00:58:08,802 --> 00:58:10,003
Where?

812
00:58:12,472 --> 00:58:13,707
Where?

813
00:58:16,476 --> 00:58:17,844
Yes.

814
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:20,246
Yes.

815
00:58:21,281 --> 00:58:22,382
Yes, we can.

816
00:59:11,164 --> 00:59:12,799
Well?

817
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:14,100
No doubt about it.

818
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:26,246
Williams here. Thank you.

819
00:59:28,682 --> 00:59:31,818
Hello, sir.
We're looking at
the film now.

820
00:59:31,852 --> 00:59:34,788
Michaelson said there's
no question about it.

821
00:59:38,424 --> 00:59:40,393
Did they
tell them everything?

822
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,166
No, sir, I'm sorry,
I can't.

823
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,433
Not a thing.

824
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:51,337
I understand. Goodbye.

825
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,380
Well, they've had to
give the press everything.

826
01:00:00,413 --> 01:00:02,382
Except the connection
with Station Three.

Who is this?

01:00:21,668 --> 01:00:24,204
All right, I'm listening.
Go ahead.

833
01:00:24,237 --> 01:00:26,973
You have seen
what I have done in Florida.

834
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:31,144
You have ignored my order.

835
01:00:31,177 --> 01:00:34,915
Continue, and you will
sacrifice hundreds of
thousands of innocent lives.

Who is this?

Who is this?

838
01:00:39,085 --> 01:00:43,589
My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

839
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:45,258
Now listen,
don't hang up.

840
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,160
I'll agree to meet you
anywhere you say.

841
01:00:47,193 --> 01:00:49,462
But you must realize
that we have to discuss...

843
01:00:54,167 --> 01:00:56,837
CAVANAUGH:
Operator! Operator!

844
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:59,873
A call just came through
on this phone, trace it.

845
01:00:59,906 --> 01:01:02,208
Why not?
This is vitally important.

846
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:04,010
Well, why is it impossible?

847
01:01:06,980 --> 01:01:08,281
I see.

848
01:01:09,515 --> 01:01:11,484
This number can be reached
by an area code number.

849
01:01:11,517 --> 01:01:13,319
That call could have
come from any place
in the country.

850
01:01:13,353 --> 01:01:16,189
It would take a week
to track it down, if then.

AINSLEY ON TAPE:
Don't interrupt.

852
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:26,800
GENERAL: All right,
I'm listening. Go ahead.

853
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:29,502
AINSLEY: You've seen
what I've done in Florida.

01:01:29,535 --> 01:01:31,772
You have ignored my order.

01:01:39,712 --> 01:01:41,748
Noon tomorrow!

01:01:43,083 --> 01:01:44,918
Who is this?

My name is
Charles Reynolds Ainsley.

don't hang up.

I'll agree to meet you
anywhere you say.

that we have to discuss...

CAVANAUGH: Operator! Operator!

865
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:07,140
A call just came through
on this number, trace it.

866
01:02:12,612 --> 01:02:14,915
We have to get every man
in the country to find him.

867
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:17,517
We're already doing that,
but it's too late,
he could be anywhere.

868
01:02:18,051 --> 01:02:21,187
And he has those flasks.

869
01:02:21,221 --> 01:02:24,190
Yes, I know that General,
and we can't evacuate
Los Angeles.

870
01:02:24,224 --> 01:02:25,658
We don't have time.

871
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:29,129
We'll have to try.
Meanwhile, we keep stalling
and hope for a break.

872
01:02:31,097 --> 01:02:32,198
Sir.

873
01:02:34,034 --> 01:02:36,536
Don't you think
we should capitulate?

874
01:02:36,569 --> 01:02:39,539
Station Three
will only be the beginning.

875
01:02:39,572 --> 01:02:42,809
It's a bluff. It must be.
No one would do such a thing.

876
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,878
Are you prepared
to take that chance?

877
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:46,179
Bring the tape recorder
with you.

878
01:02:46,212 --> 01:02:48,915
There's no point in
continuing this charade
of hiding out here.

879
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:51,351
Lee, I'd like to have you
check out...

880
01:02:52,285 --> 01:02:53,519
What is it?

881
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:56,189
Why did he give his name?

882
01:02:56,222 --> 01:03:00,460
It doesn't make any sense.
It would have been better
to keep us guessing.

883
01:03:00,493 --> 01:03:02,728
I don't agree.
That's exactly what
a paranoid would do.

884
01:03:02,762 --> 01:03:05,565
You heard that voice.
A monstrous ego working.

885
01:03:05,598 --> 01:03:08,034
No, sir,
there's something wrong.

886
01:03:08,068 --> 01:03:09,936
GENERAL: What?

887
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:13,506
I can't put my finger on it,
I don't really know.

888
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,241
We'll be at Station Three.

889
01:03:33,259 --> 01:03:34,694
I checked out
the car for you, Lee.

890
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:37,097
He got a flat
coming down the canyon.
Where?

891
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:39,532
It was picked up
about a half mile
down the road.

892
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,634
A couple hundred feet
above split rock.

893
01:03:41,667 --> 01:03:44,070
You remember, we caught
some trout there.

894
01:03:44,104 --> 01:03:46,406
You can still see the marks
on the shoulder.

895
01:03:46,439 --> 01:03:47,840
See you.

896
01:03:52,879 --> 01:03:55,015
What's the significance
of the car, Lee?

897
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:58,251
Nothing, just checking,
you check everything.

898
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:27,113
Is that where
the car got the flat?

899
01:04:27,147 --> 01:04:30,183
Well, the car
slipped off the jack.

900
01:04:30,216 --> 01:04:32,052
Obviously, he tried
to dig a hole to get it
back on and couldn't,

901
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:34,154
so he abandoned it.

902
01:04:35,956 --> 01:04:37,323
Come on.

903
01:04:50,736 --> 01:04:54,407
All right, sit down here, Ann.
Now follow me on this.

904
01:04:55,541 --> 01:04:57,377
Everybody figures

905
01:04:57,410 --> 01:04:59,745
that whoever
took the bugs got out.

906
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,182
They're gone.

907
01:05:02,215 --> 01:05:06,086
The inside assist,
Ostrer, he's dead.

908
01:05:07,553 --> 01:05:11,491
But let's suppose
that there's another man
that's tied up in all this,

909
01:05:11,524 --> 01:05:14,560
who's still here,
who can't get out.

910
01:05:14,594 --> 01:05:17,230
Why does he have to get out?
Why doesn't he just stay here?

911
01:05:17,263 --> 01:05:18,931
Because he's got
something vital.

912
01:05:18,965 --> 01:05:22,602
Something that Ainsley's
got to have, and he's
got to have in a hurry.

913
01:05:22,635 --> 01:05:23,970
I don't understand.

914
01:05:25,405 --> 01:05:27,573
Two men got into E Lab.

915
01:05:27,607 --> 01:05:30,076
One got out as Baxter,
he walked out.

916
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,944
The other one
through the fence
with the bugs.

917
01:05:31,978 --> 01:05:33,746
Let's say that they met
this third man,

918
01:05:33,779 --> 01:05:36,116
who took all the flasks,
except two,

919
01:05:36,149 --> 01:05:39,919
which he gave to them,
and then they took off,
probably in Baxter's car.

920
01:05:39,952 --> 01:05:42,922
One flask for Florida.
One for Los Angeles.

921
01:05:42,955 --> 01:05:44,457
I've got that.

922
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:49,029
Now, let's say that
this third man takes off
with the rest of the flasks.

923
01:05:49,062 --> 01:05:51,231
But he's got one more thing
that he must do.

924
01:05:51,264 --> 01:05:53,733
Knock off Ostrer,
who's a threat somehow.

925
01:05:53,766 --> 01:05:55,735
Let's say
he knocks off Ostrer,

926
01:05:55,768 --> 01:05:58,304
comes down this road,
free and clear.

927
01:05:58,338 --> 01:06:00,440
And then the nightmare
of all criminals happens.

928
01:06:00,473 --> 01:06:02,508
The senseless accident.

929
01:06:04,310 --> 01:06:05,511
The flat.
Right!

930
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:08,214
He tries to fix it,
the car slips off the jack.

931
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:11,084
Now he's stuck.
What would you do?

932
01:06:11,117 --> 01:06:12,618
I'd hitchhike down the road.

933
01:06:12,652 --> 01:06:13,853
But the bugs?

934
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,388
You couldn't take a chance
on taking them with you

935
01:06:15,421 --> 01:06:16,956
and you wouldn't leave them
in the car.

936
01:06:16,989 --> 01:06:19,559
So, where would you put them
where they'd be safe?

937
01:06:19,592 --> 01:06:21,994
Where you could
get to them when you
were free to

938
01:06:22,028 --> 01:06:24,064
and where they'd stay cool.

939
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:29,135
The water.

940
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:30,203
I'd hide them in the water.

941
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,637
That's what I think.

942
01:06:54,494 --> 01:06:55,728
Lee!

943
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:46,246
Whose car was that?

944
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:47,947
Just stand.

945
01:07:49,081 --> 01:07:50,983
Perfectly still.

946
01:07:54,787 --> 01:07:56,356
Handle that gently.

947
01:08:00,226 --> 01:08:02,262
Those misses were intentional.

948
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:04,464
Stand exactly
where you are, Ann.

949
01:08:13,973 --> 01:08:16,709
And that I presume
was Doctor Baxter?

950
01:08:16,742 --> 01:08:18,978
Just put the flask
back in the box.

951
01:09:44,364 --> 01:09:45,665
Sit down.

952
01:10:08,053 --> 01:10:10,290
There's a phone call for you
in the administration,
Mr. Cavanaugh.

953
01:10:10,323 --> 01:10:11,491
Thank you.

954
01:10:32,945 --> 01:10:34,647
Absolutely no sign of them.

955
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,649
We checked out
Barrett's car.

956
01:10:36,682 --> 01:10:39,251
No sign of violence
there or anywhere.

957
01:10:39,285 --> 01:10:42,254
Just some footprints
down by the bank
of the stream. Nothing else.

958
01:10:42,288 --> 01:10:44,189
Have you heard
anything here?

959
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:45,725
No.

960
01:10:45,758 --> 01:10:47,827
He hasn't been missing long.
He could be anywhere.

961
01:10:47,860 --> 01:10:49,295
You know what
he's like, sir.

962
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:53,466
I don't understand why
Barrett is so interested
in Dr. Hoffman's car.

963
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,934
I don't either, sir.

964
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:56,436
The Highway Patrol
officer said...

965
01:10:56,469 --> 01:10:57,002
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

966
01:10:57,036 --> 01:10:58,571
Yes?

967
01:10:58,604 --> 01:11:00,706
MAN ON INTERCOM:
Mr. Cavanaugh?
Johnson's on the line.

968
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:02,207
Put him on.
JOHNSON: Hello?

969
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:04,276
Yes, Johnson.

970
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:06,512
No sign of them
in any of the places
we've looked in town.

971
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:08,914
Keep looking.
Yes, sir.

972
01:11:08,948 --> 01:11:13,619
The officer said that Barrett
just wanted to know where
the doctor had had the flat.

973
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:17,557
Well, so what?
We knew about it.
You had a flat last night.

974
01:11:17,590 --> 01:11:21,427
You started to hitchhike,
they picked you up outside
of town and brought you here.

975
01:11:21,461 --> 01:11:22,828
I was very lucky.

976
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:26,031
That road is lonely at night,
but I was picked up
in the canyon.

977
01:11:26,065 --> 01:11:27,367
Not outside of town.

978
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:28,701
Yes.

979
01:11:28,734 --> 01:11:32,037
Barrett is liable to call us
anytime from anywhere.

980
01:11:32,071 --> 01:11:34,340
I think it means nothing.

981
01:11:34,374 --> 01:11:35,708
I've pulled
all the roadblocks.

982
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:38,478
You want me to
put them back,
just in case?

983
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:39,579
GENERAL: No point in that.

984
01:11:39,612 --> 01:11:40,446
(INTERCOM BUZZING)

985
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,214
GENERAL: Yes?

986
01:11:42,247 --> 01:11:43,749
MAN ON INTERCOM:
There's a call
for Dr. Hoffman.

987
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:46,452
GENERAL:
Put it through. Doctor.

988
01:11:46,486 --> 01:11:48,721
DONALD: Doctor Hoffman?
Yes.

989
01:11:48,754 --> 01:11:50,990
Hello, Gregor,
this is Donald.

990
01:11:51,023 --> 01:11:55,728
Sorry to disturb you,
but we were going fishing
this afternoon, remember?

991
01:11:55,761 --> 01:11:58,230
Well, I... I couldn't,
I was tied up here.

992
01:11:58,263 --> 01:12:01,033
Sorry you missed out,
the fishing was good.

993
01:12:01,066 --> 01:12:04,837
Do you have to work tonight?
We're at your trailer.
How about dinner?

994
01:12:04,870 --> 01:12:07,973
(STUTTERING) Well, Donald,
I... I do not see how...

995
01:12:08,007 --> 01:12:12,778
I wish you could.
There's something
I want to talk to you about.

996
01:12:12,812 --> 01:12:14,346
Well, it would be
very nice, Donald...

997
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:16,849
There's no need
for you to stay here now.

998
01:12:16,882 --> 01:12:19,585
Jeff, run the Doctor home.
All right, Eric.

999
01:12:19,619 --> 01:12:20,786
Thank you.

1000
01:12:20,820 --> 01:12:23,389
I will be there
in a few minutes, Donald.
Good.

1001
01:12:47,547 --> 01:12:49,549
Thank you.

1002
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:23,148
DONALD: He stopped on
the road, slid down the bank,

1003
01:13:23,182 --> 01:13:26,318
and got to the flasks
before we did.

1004
01:13:26,351 --> 01:13:27,987
This is the only place
we had to hide 'em.

1005
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:31,356
I know it was taking
a chance to call you.

1006
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:34,560
But I was afraid
you were caught.
He knew about your car.

1007
01:13:34,594 --> 01:13:38,197
Now we're stuck.
There are roadblocks
all over the place.

1008
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:41,400
Everything's fine, Donald.

1009
01:13:41,433 --> 01:13:45,337
Nobody's suspicious,
and the roadblocks
have been removed.

1010
01:13:47,540 --> 01:13:51,243
It seems that Mr. Barrett
is so unpredictable

1011
01:13:51,276 --> 01:13:54,246
that nothing has been made
of their disappearance.

1012
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,984
Did Los Angeles
go as planned, Veretti?

1013
01:13:59,018 --> 01:14:00,285
I put it there.

1014
01:14:09,161 --> 01:14:10,663
We will take them
with us.

1015
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,097
That's dangerous.

1016
01:14:12,131 --> 01:14:14,399
If there is any trouble,
they will be our
best protection.

1017
01:14:23,843 --> 01:14:27,479
There's nothing happening yet.
They're still all
in the trailer.

1018
01:14:27,513 --> 01:14:29,849
GENERAL: What about
the manager?

1019
01:14:29,882 --> 01:14:31,483
Oh, we're keeping
the manager out of the way.

1020
01:14:31,517 --> 01:14:33,586
Do you think Barrett saw you?
Possibly.

1021
01:14:33,619 --> 01:14:35,955
But he'd never recognize me,
he's never seen me before.

1022
01:14:35,988 --> 01:14:37,422
Can you see anything
going on in there?

1023
01:14:37,456 --> 01:14:42,061
There's no movement,
no sound, no,
nothing happening.

1024
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:43,395
Keep on the line.

1025
01:14:43,428 --> 01:14:45,164
MICHAELSON: Why would
Dr. Hoffman be
connected with this?

1026
01:14:45,197 --> 01:14:46,498
Why? I don't understand.

1027
01:14:46,532 --> 01:14:48,601
He checked out perfectly.
There's nothing
in his background

1028
01:14:48,634 --> 01:14:51,136
to indicate that he's...
Dr. Michaelson, please.

1029
01:14:51,170 --> 01:14:53,138
We've got to grab them, sir.
Right now.

1030
01:14:53,172 --> 01:14:55,274
Certainly not,
Cavanaugh.

1031
01:14:55,307 --> 01:14:58,944
Now, we know that Barrett
is in Dr. Hoffman's trailer
with two strange men.

1032
01:14:58,978 --> 01:15:02,748
And we know that Dr. Hoffman
is there and he's connected
with those men.

1033
01:15:02,782 --> 01:15:07,086
And we know Dr. Hoffman's car
had some special
significance to Barrett.

1034
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:09,088
And that's all we know.

1035
01:15:09,121 --> 01:15:13,158
We don't even know
if Barrett went there
willingly or unwillingly.

1036
01:15:13,192 --> 01:15:15,394
Let me grab them, sir,
and I'll find out.

1037
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,496
I don't think you'd find out
anything that would be worth

1038
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:18,163
losing the only advantage
we have.

1039
01:15:18,197 --> 01:15:22,568
MICHAELSON: What is that?

1040
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:25,871
They will lead us
to Ainsley, to the flasks.

1041
01:15:26,639 --> 01:15:29,174
Only the flasks
are important.

1042
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:32,377
This is the break
we've been praying for.

1043
01:15:32,411 --> 01:15:35,715
They're going to leave.
We let them.

1044
01:15:35,748 --> 01:15:38,851
Then we shadow them,
very carefully.

1045
01:15:38,884 --> 01:15:42,855
Let one eager beaver
show our hand,
and we're through.

1046
01:15:42,888 --> 01:15:44,189
Now set it up.

1047
01:15:45,490 --> 01:15:48,994
In the desert we're okay,
not much traffic.

1048
01:15:49,028 --> 01:15:50,696
But we could lose them
in the first town.

1049
01:15:50,730 --> 01:15:52,031
And what if they head
for that mess that'll be

1050
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:54,299
coming out of Los Angeles?
We'll change
our strategy by then.

1051
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:56,001
At least we'll know
which way they're headed.

1052
01:15:56,035 --> 01:15:57,737
Set it up.
Yes, sir.

1053
01:16:10,082 --> 01:16:11,717
MAN ON RADIO:
The evacuation of
Los Angeles is under way.

1054
01:16:11,751 --> 01:16:13,719
(HELICOPTER FLYING)

1055
01:16:13,753 --> 01:16:19,358
It is too early to say yet
how effective this will be,
or how possible it will be.

1056
01:16:19,391 --> 01:16:22,594
There is no further
official word as to the exact
imminence of the threat.

1057
01:16:22,628 --> 01:16:25,665
It means nothing.
There are military training
fields all around here.

1058
01:16:25,698 --> 01:16:28,701
Incident in Florida
is related to this situation.

1059
01:16:28,734 --> 01:16:31,236
PILOT ON RADIO:
I'm staying above
and behind them.

1060
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:34,173
They're still traveling west
on 17.

1061
01:16:34,206 --> 01:16:35,808
They seem to be stalling.

1062
01:16:35,841 --> 01:16:38,410
They're almost
going around in circles.

1063
01:16:38,443 --> 01:16:40,279
Why?

1064
01:16:40,312 --> 01:16:44,449
Evasive action.
They're taking the long way
to wherever they're going.

1065
01:16:52,091 --> 01:16:54,894
It's getting
a little difficult
to keep them in sight.

1066
01:16:54,927 --> 01:16:58,430
This is pretty rough country
and it's closing in
on the road.

1067
01:16:58,463 --> 01:17:00,299
I don't like this section
they're going through.

1068
01:17:00,332 --> 01:17:03,468
It's impossible to keep
visual contact without
the chopper tipping its hand.

1069
01:17:03,502 --> 01:17:07,239
There are only three points
they can come out of there,
here, here and here.

1070
01:17:07,272 --> 01:17:08,974
You have men covering
all of them, haven't you?

1071
01:17:09,008 --> 01:17:12,044
Yes, sir. I'll double up
here and here.

1072
01:17:12,077 --> 01:17:14,246
PILOT: I'm going to lose them
for a long stretch now.

1073
01:17:14,279 --> 01:17:15,881
Unless I close in.

1074
01:17:15,915 --> 01:17:17,817
Don't close up,
stay out of sight

1075
01:17:17,850 --> 01:17:20,219
until you can pick them up
on the other side
of the section.

1076
01:17:20,252 --> 01:17:21,153
PILOT: Will do.

1077
01:17:21,186 --> 01:17:23,989
Where's your follow car?

and it's announced
that Station Three
is being destroyed,

1180
01:30:15,093 --> 01:30:18,196
will you take me
to where the flask is
and immobilize it?

1181
01:30:20,499 --> 01:30:23,367
Perhaps you had better
get in the car, Mr. Barrett.

1182

On the other side.

1183
01:30:47,358 --> 01:30:48,693
I determined in
the laboratory

1184
01:30:48,727 --> 01:30:52,196
that only a four
and a half pound pressure
shatters this flask.

1185
01:30:53,965 --> 01:30:55,767
I can easily apply that.

1186
01:31:10,314 --> 01:31:12,350
I spotted
the station wagon again.

1187

They're still moving north
on Seco Road.

Any sign of

No.

1190
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,664
It looks like there's
some kind of fire back there
where they came from.

A lot of orange flame

Ah, I can't believe
how stupid I've been.

1195
01:31:38,276 --> 01:31:40,945
Ainsley's been missing
for months and Hoffman's
been on the scene for months.

1196
01:31:40,979 --> 01:31:43,347
Or at least you're
an impersonation of
the real Hoffman.

1197
01:31:43,381 --> 01:31:44,816
What happened to him?

1198
01:31:47,118 --> 01:31:49,420
That's not hard to figure.
Gregor Hoffman,
living in Vienna,

01:31:49,453 --> 01:31:50,555

from Austria.

1200
01:31:50,589 --> 01:31:53,692
Did you kill him
or did you have him killed?

1201
01:31:53,725 --> 01:31:56,227
You're no biochemist,
how did you fool them?

1202
01:31:56,260 --> 01:31:58,496
I am a biochemist,
Mr. Barrett, of sorts.

1203
01:31:58,529 --> 01:32:00,464
If you were more familiar
with the name Ainsley,

1204
01:32:00,498 --> 01:32:03,101
you'd know
I made my fortune
in patent medicines.

1205
01:32:03,134 --> 01:32:06,204
Sometimes a little bit of
knowledge goes a long way.

1206
01:32:06,237 --> 01:32:07,872
The accent? Easy.

1207
01:32:07,906 --> 01:32:09,808
I lived for years
in Austria.

1208
01:32:09,841 --> 01:32:12,343
Besides, Gregor Hoffman,
though he lived
an obscure life,

1209
01:32:12,376 --> 01:32:14,278
was a world famous chemist.

1210
01:32:14,312 --> 01:32:16,815
You don't ask
a famous chemist
the formula for salt.

1211
01:32:16,848 --> 01:32:18,917
But Ostrer did.
You had everyone fooled
but Ostrer.

1212
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:21,953
He knew you weren't
the real Hoffman,
so he died, too.

1213
01:32:21,986 --> 01:32:24,088
That tone is
surprisingly juvenile,
Mr. Barrett.

1214
01:32:24,122 --> 01:32:26,490
I believe that
hundreds of people
might have died in Florida.

1215
01:32:26,524 --> 01:32:29,093
This afternoon when
I was interrogating you,
you heard Cavanaugh say that.

1216
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:31,362
Ainsley was our man.
Then you knew what to do.

1217
01:32:31,395 --> 01:32:32,831
Somehow you made
two telephone calls.

1218
01:32:32,864 --> 01:32:34,899
One to your boys
to pick up the flasks
where you had to leave them

1219
01:32:34,933 --> 01:32:36,167
in the stream
and the other
to the General.

1220
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,469
So you could give us
your ultimatum on Los Angeles.

1221
01:32:38,502 --> 01:32:40,672
Use the name C.R. Ainsley
so he would drop
the road blocks

1222
01:32:40,705 --> 01:32:42,974
and you could get out,
and he fell for it.

1223
01:32:43,007 --> 01:32:44,242
That's correct.

1224
01:32:44,275 --> 01:32:46,177
I didn't make
the telephone calls
somehow, Mr. Barrett.

1225
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:47,946
I made them from
Station Three.

1229
01:33:02,861 --> 01:33:04,896
You're lucky
but you're mortal.
We all are.

1230
01:33:10,201 --> 01:33:14,572
MAN ON RADIO:
Tank vehicles carrying
liquids, assembly point B.

1231
01:33:14,605 --> 01:33:17,842
Ambulance section
re-designated, C.

1232
01:33:17,876 --> 01:33:22,513
Repeat, ambulance section
re-designated, C.

1233
01:33:22,546 --> 01:33:26,350
Control requests
the following be read
at five minute intervals.

1234
01:33:26,384 --> 01:33:29,854
An unidentified
scientific research
installation

1235
01:33:29,888 --> 01:33:32,924
based in Southern California
has ceased operation.

1236
01:33:32,957 --> 01:33:36,928
It will be dismantled
and cease to exist.
End announcement.

1237
01:33:50,675 --> 01:33:52,110
There he is.

1238
01:33:52,143 --> 01:33:53,544
Who's that with him?

1239
01:33:53,577 --> 01:33:55,146
I don't know.

1240
01:34:14,465 --> 01:34:16,701
You're under arrest,
Doctor Hoffman.

1241
01:34:18,102 --> 01:34:19,871
You're Lee Barrett,
aren't you?
That's right.

1242
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,305
What are you
doing here, Barrett?

1243
01:34:21,339 --> 01:34:23,007
That's a long story.

1244
01:34:23,975 --> 01:34:26,044
Get out of the car, Doctor.

1245
01:34:26,077 --> 01:34:29,413
BARRETT: Be careful,
he's got a flask
in his pocket.

1246
01:34:35,453 --> 01:34:37,421
All right,
hand it over, Doctor.

1247
01:34:38,990 --> 01:34:40,291
Right now.

1248
01:34:42,126 --> 01:34:43,862
The end of the line?

1249
01:34:54,973 --> 01:34:57,141
All right,
get into the car, Doctor.

1250
01:34:59,143 --> 01:35:01,312
Better come along
with us, Barrett.

1251
01:35:04,282 --> 01:35:05,716
How did you get here?

1252
01:35:05,750 --> 01:35:06,818
We're spread
all over the place.

1253
01:35:06,851 --> 01:35:08,586
This is one of
50 we're covering.

1254
01:35:08,619 --> 01:35:10,154
What about the girl
and the two other guys?

1255
01:35:10,188 --> 01:35:11,890
I don't know.
Where's Cavanaugh?

1256
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:13,992
They could be anywhere.
Our orders were
to pick up Hoffman,

1257
01:35:14,025 --> 01:35:15,326
stay off the radio,
and don't say a word

1258
01:35:15,359 --> 01:35:17,461
until we get him
to Station Three.

1259
01:35:28,239 --> 01:35:31,175
(WHISPERING) Have you
got enough sense to
keep your mouth shut?

1260
01:35:31,209 --> 01:35:32,210
Yes.

1261
01:35:34,012 --> 01:35:37,048
We've got
a jack-knifed truck up here.
You can turn your engine off.

1262
01:35:37,081 --> 01:35:40,952
It won't be long.
The tow truck will have it
out of here in a few minutes.

1263
01:35:40,985 --> 01:35:42,386
Anybody hurt?

1264
01:35:42,420 --> 01:35:44,055
No, he was lucky.

1265
01:35:53,564 --> 01:35:56,134
We got a jack-knifed truck,
it won't be long.

1266
01:36:09,547 --> 01:36:13,151
Won't be long he says.
Did you ever hear
a cop say anything else?

1267
01:36:13,184 --> 01:36:14,785
It'll be hours.

1268
01:36:14,819 --> 01:36:18,622
By that time, that mess
from L.A. will hit us
and we'll never move.

1269
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:23,127
Look at all those cans
and busted beer bottles.

1270
01:36:23,161 --> 01:36:26,931
You'd think
people wouldn't throw
things out there like that.

1271
01:36:26,965 --> 01:36:28,432
You got a match?

1272
01:36:28,466 --> 01:36:30,368
Would you look at the jerk
handling that tow truck?

1273
01:36:30,401 --> 01:36:33,004
He's worse than the man
that was driving the rig.

1274
01:36:33,037 --> 01:36:34,505
Oh, boy,
that's all we need.

1275
01:36:34,538 --> 01:36:36,274
A sidewalk superintendent.

1276
01:36:37,275 --> 01:36:39,110
Wise guy, huh?

1277
01:37:04,135 --> 01:37:05,603
There's your daughter,
but what's happened
to Barrett?

1278
01:37:05,636 --> 01:37:07,205
Where's Hoffman?

1279
01:37:09,140 --> 01:37:11,876
Dad! Dad!

1280
01:37:11,910 --> 01:37:14,545
Dad, Lee's dead.
They threw a flask,

1281
01:37:14,578 --> 01:37:16,080
they threw a flask
back at the gas station.

1282
01:37:16,114 --> 01:37:17,715
What happened to Barrett,
where is he?

1283
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:19,383
You've got to
go clear out the area.
He's at the station.

1284
01:37:19,417 --> 01:37:21,920
Don't you understand?
That man Veretti,
he threw a flask.

1285
01:37:21,953 --> 01:37:23,187
Sir.

1286
01:37:27,225 --> 01:37:28,092
Where is the Satan Bug?

1287
01:37:28,126 --> 01:37:29,460
Hoffman took it.
He changed cars

1288
01:37:29,493 --> 01:37:31,229
and he went back
the way we came from.
What kind of car was it?

1289
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:33,131
It was a green Ford sedan.

1290
01:37:33,164 --> 01:37:34,565
License?
Oh, I don't know,

1291
01:37:34,598 --> 01:37:38,002
I couldn't see it
very clearly. It was
FGA, something, 7, I think.

1292
01:37:38,036 --> 01:37:40,071
Put it on the radio.
Hey, give me that stuff.

1293
01:37:40,104 --> 01:37:41,772
Dad, you've got to go back
and clear out that area.

1294
01:37:41,805 --> 01:37:43,841
That's all right, dear,
that's all right.

1295
01:37:43,874 --> 01:37:44,943
The flask is harmless now.

1296
01:37:44,976 --> 01:37:47,912
The station burned.
There's nothing
to worry about.

1297
01:37:47,946 --> 01:37:50,548
We found the bodies
of Cavanaugh's men,
but not Lee's.

1298
01:37:50,581 --> 01:37:52,083
But Lee was in the building.
He was in the building.

1299
01:37:52,116 --> 01:37:56,720
Well, he's not there now.
Ann, Los Angeles,

1300
01:37:56,754 --> 01:37:59,991
did anyone say anything
about Los Angeles? Anything?

1301
01:38:00,024 --> 01:38:01,359
No. Nothing.

1302
01:38:01,392 --> 01:38:03,561
Put everything you've got
on Hoffman's car.

1303
01:38:03,594 --> 01:38:05,263
Yes, sir.
We're already on it.

1304
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:07,331
But there are an awful lot of
green Fords around.

1305
01:38:07,365 --> 01:38:10,568
And there's nothing
on these guys
except this stuff.

1306
01:38:10,601 --> 01:38:14,638
Guns, money, watches,
phony drivers license

1307
01:38:15,739 --> 01:38:17,608
and keys.

1308
01:38:17,641 --> 01:38:20,544
Maybe one of the keys
fits something in Los Angeles.

1309
01:38:20,578 --> 01:38:22,613
But how the hell
do we check that?

1310
01:38:59,117 --> 01:39:01,452
(ENGINE SPUTTERING)

1311
01:39:01,485 --> 01:39:03,421
Sounds like the ignition.

1312
01:39:26,844 --> 01:39:28,746
Take a look
at that fuel pump.

1313
01:39:44,628 --> 01:39:46,897
You didn't really think
that I'd fall for
those goons of yours

1314
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:49,100
posing as Cavanaugh's men,
did you?

1315
01:39:58,109 --> 01:40:00,411
Okay, I've got the gun now.

1316
01:40:00,444 --> 01:40:03,447
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1317
01:40:03,481 --> 01:40:05,716
before that copter of yours
settles down.

1318
01:40:05,749 --> 01:40:07,551
You haven't given me
any reason why
I won't smash this.

1319
01:40:08,119 --> 01:40:12,323
This is the end of the line,
Ainsley.

1320
01:40:12,356 --> 01:40:13,891
For real now.

1321
01:40:13,924 --> 01:40:15,593
Put the bottle down
and step away from it

1322
01:40:15,626 --> 01:40:17,528
or I'll blow
a hole in your head!

1323
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:24,802
You're psychotic,
but don't be stupid.

1324
01:40:24,835 --> 01:40:27,871
If I blow a hole
in your head or you
drop that bottle,

1325
01:40:27,905 --> 01:40:30,741
you'll die,
then you'll have nothing.

1326
01:40:30,774 --> 01:40:33,911
Perhaps I am psychotic,
but I'm certainly not stupid.

1327
01:40:33,944 --> 01:40:37,381
If I smash this,
I wouldn't die, Mr. Barrett.

1328
01:40:39,417 --> 01:40:40,584
Why do you think
Baxter waited so long

1329
01:40:40,618 --> 01:40:42,953
before telling anyone
about the Satan Bug.

1330
01:40:42,986 --> 01:40:44,822
Why do you think
he was working nights?
Weekends?

1331
01:40:44,855 --> 01:40:46,157
The vaccine!

1332
01:40:47,391 --> 01:40:49,693
Well, I waited for
the vaccine.

1333
01:40:49,727 --> 01:40:52,863
Two days ago he made it,
that's why he had
to die and Ostrer.

1334
01:40:52,896 --> 01:40:54,965
You were wrong
about him, too.

1335
01:40:54,998 --> 01:40:56,734
He didn't suspect me.
He didn't suspect anyone.

1336
01:40:56,767 --> 01:40:58,469
He just knew
about the vaccine

1337
01:40:58,502 --> 01:41:01,105
and now I'm the only one
who has the formula.

1338
01:41:01,139 --> 01:41:03,207
And the vaccine is
in my bloodstream.

1339
01:41:03,241 --> 01:41:05,176
I'm immune!
I won't die, I'm immune!

1340
01:41:05,743 --> 01:41:09,046
But you told us
what the Satan Bug would do.

1341
01:41:09,079 --> 01:41:13,651
You mean to say that you'd
live on this world alone?
By yourself?

1342
01:41:13,684 --> 01:41:16,654
I told you about
the Satan Bug to keep you
from finding Baxter.

1343
01:41:16,687 --> 01:41:18,856
Even so,
he believed every word I said.

1344
01:41:18,889 --> 01:41:22,460
But I'm not sure
how good a biochemist he was.

1345
01:41:22,493 --> 01:41:24,928
Some scientists thought
that the H-bomb would
start a chain reaction

1346
01:41:24,962 --> 01:41:28,632
that would blow up the world,
but it didn't.

1347
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,834
Now, nobody really knows
about this.

1348
01:41:30,868 --> 01:41:32,970
Theoretically, yes.

1349
01:41:33,003 --> 01:41:36,507
But it hasn't yet
been put to the real test.

1350
01:41:36,540 --> 01:41:39,677
Perhaps it will
destroy all life.

1351
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,212
Perhaps.

1352
01:41:41,245 --> 01:41:43,381
Certainly it could
destroy millions.

1353
01:41:44,982 --> 01:41:46,884
Do you want to test it?

1354
01:42:03,267 --> 01:42:04,768
Mr. Ainsley?
Yes.

1355
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:10,107
I was watching for you
and saw the car stop.

1356
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:12,109
Thought I'd better
pick you up here.

1357
01:42:12,142 --> 01:42:15,946
The engine failed.
Don't worry about it,
we'll take off immediately.

1358
01:42:15,979 --> 01:42:17,381
Yes, sir.

1359
01:42:18,449 --> 01:42:20,651
Any trouble, Mr. Ainsley?
No, no.

1360
01:42:27,258 --> 01:42:28,058
Well, Mr. Barrett?

1361
01:42:28,091 --> 01:42:30,261
The flask is still in
Los Angeles.

1362
01:43:23,347 --> 01:43:25,683
Still nothing?
I'm afraid not, sir.

1363
01:43:25,716 --> 01:43:27,485
Nothing on Los Angeles,
nothing at all?

1364
01:43:27,518 --> 01:43:28,686
Nothing of any consequence.

1365
01:43:28,719 --> 01:43:30,254
(PHONE RINGING)

1366
01:43:30,288 --> 01:43:31,489
Hello.

1367
01:43:31,522 --> 01:43:33,291
Only two tie-ups
to Los Angeles.

1368
01:43:33,324 --> 01:43:35,426
One of them is
an office building, here.
Where?

1369
01:43:35,459 --> 01:43:37,628
Ten stories high,
we've got men
going through them.

1370
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:38,996
Starting from the top.

1371
01:43:39,029 --> 01:43:42,733
Now, the only other thing
is this little notation
in red ink.

1372
01:43:42,766 --> 01:43:44,368
Glendale 73.

1373
01:43:44,402 --> 01:43:46,570
We've got men calling
on every house with 73,

1374
01:43:46,604 --> 01:43:48,506
every phone number
beginning with 73,

1375
01:43:48,539 --> 01:43:50,841
every cab, well,
you get the idea, sir.

1376
01:43:50,874 --> 01:43:52,710
Yes.

1377
01:43:52,743 --> 01:43:56,246
Veretti did that,
he was doodling while
they were waiting for Hoffman.

1378
01:43:56,280 --> 01:43:58,115
Hold on, Jack,
take this.

1379
01:43:59,317 --> 01:44:01,051
Well, they found
the green car.

1380
01:44:01,084 --> 01:44:03,387
Where?
It was abandoned
in front of a restaurant

1381
01:44:03,421 --> 01:44:05,689
next to a service station
near Palmdale.

1382
01:44:05,723 --> 01:44:06,857
They were both closed,

1383
01:44:06,890 --> 01:44:08,692
but a watchman in
a gravel yard
across the street

1384
01:44:08,726 --> 01:44:11,662
saw the green car park
and two men get out.

1385
01:44:11,695 --> 01:44:14,064
He described
Hoffman perfectly.

1386
01:44:14,097 --> 01:44:14,665
And the other man?

1387
01:44:14,698 --> 01:44:17,100
It sounds like Barrett.

1388
01:44:17,134 --> 01:44:18,602
Well, what happened to them?

1389
01:44:18,636 --> 01:44:20,971
There were two other men
waiting in a black car.

1390
01:44:21,004 --> 01:44:22,640
They held guns
on the first two.

1391
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:25,242
Then they got in the black car
and all four drove off.

1392
01:44:25,275 --> 01:44:26,877
Didn't the night watchman
try to stop them?

1393
01:44:26,910 --> 01:44:28,111
No.

1394
01:44:28,712 --> 01:44:30,213
God!

1395
01:44:30,247 --> 01:44:32,450
There's something else.

1396
01:44:32,483 --> 01:44:34,685
The watchman said
one of the men was
carrying something

1397
01:44:34,718 --> 01:44:36,854
that looked like
a small flask.

1398
01:44:39,022 --> 01:44:41,224
No license plate
on the black car?

1399
01:44:41,258 --> 01:44:43,093
Wrong angle,
couldn't see it.

Eric.

1402
01:44:58,809 --> 01:45:01,945
This was doodled
by that maniac, Veretti.
Look at this.

1403
01:45:03,714 --> 01:45:04,114
That could be a flask.

1404
01:45:04,147 --> 01:45:06,083
It is a flask.

1405
01:45:07,985 --> 01:45:10,220
I think all these
are flasks.

1406
01:45:10,788 --> 01:45:12,990
That is something real.

1407
01:45:13,023 --> 01:45:16,494
He's unconsciously
trying to draw
or doodle something.

1408
01:45:16,527 --> 01:45:20,263
What is it?

1409
01:45:20,297 --> 01:45:24,201
Those lines look like
parking dividers
on a parking lot.

1410
01:45:25,836 --> 01:45:27,471
Sir, look at this.

A baseball stadium?

01:45:44,555 --> 01:45:46,023
Jack, give me that.

1415

Put me on Los Angeles 47
right away.

Yes, we're here looking.

Yeah, yeah, I know.

You don't have
any intentions of going
where the flask is, do you?

1458
01:50:48,959 --> 01:50:51,394
As much as you have
of destroying
Station Three.

1459

That's not very clear
thinking, Ainsley.

If you intend to
take Los Angeles,
I'll take you,

get on the mike

And then?

Then, for the first time
in the world...

What are your plans
for the world, Ainsley?

It doesn't make
any difference
what you choose,

I can't give you
any information

you said about Hoffman?

1490
01:53:27,384 --> 01:53:28,651
He jumped!

1491
01:53:28,685 --> 01:53:30,954
Oh, and tell Cavanaugh
to stop looking for Ainsley.

1492
01:53:30,988 --> 01:53:34,091
Ainsley and Hoffman
were the same man.

1493
01:53:34,124 --> 01:53:36,759
I'll be setting down at LAX.
Tell the boys to be
on the lookout for me.

01:53:36,793 --> 01:53:39,296
I'm a little rusty
at these things.

1495
01:53:39,329 --> 01:53:41,731
We'll meet you there, Lee.
Take it nice and easy

1496
01:53:41,764 --> 01:53:44,434
and for God's sake
make a good landing.

1497
01:53:44,467 --> 01:53:48,872
I'll put down safely
and I'll give you the flask.

1498
01:53:48,906 --> 01:53:50,673
And then we're right back
where we started.
