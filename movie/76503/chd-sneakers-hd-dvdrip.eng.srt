Transfer to 53-01138.

4
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:01,676
What'd we just do?

5
00:02:01,744 --> 00:02:05,009
The RepubIican Party made a
generous donation to the BIack Panthers.

6
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:07,809
- Farm out.
- Right arm.

7
00:02:07,882 --> 00:02:11,215
- Who's next?
- Let's see.

8
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:14,742
Richard Nixon's personaI
checking account is in here.

9
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,753
This is a chaIIenge.

10
00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:20,484
Marty, we have to find somebody
truIy worthy to give his money to.

11
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,820
How about...

12
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,190
the NationaI Association
to LegaIize Marijuana?

13
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,194
Perfect.
How much shouId he give?

14
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:31,221
He's a generous man. I'd say,
aII he's got. God, I'm hungry!

15
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:33,663
Marty...

16
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:36,293
you are sure we wiII
not get into troubIe for this?

17
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:39,826
Cosmo, trust me.

18
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,007
Posit: The phone company
has too much money.

19
00:02:49,077 --> 00:02:50,408
Good one.

20
00:02:50,477 --> 00:02:53,776
- Consequence?
- They're corrupt. ResuIt?

21
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,246
The system perpetuates itseIf
at the expense of the peopIe.

22
00:02:57,315 --> 00:03:01,547
- ConcIusion?
- Ma BeII needs to donate some money.

23
00:03:01,618 --> 00:03:03,483
We're gonna
change the worId.

24
00:03:03,553 --> 00:03:07,887
I just wish we couId get
course credit for this. Gosh!

25
00:03:07,956 --> 00:03:11,585
You gotta eat.
You want some food?

26
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,560
Loser goes.

27
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,152
I never Iose.

28
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:25,429
Pepperoni pizza, pIease,
shaken, not stirred.

29
00:03:25,534 --> 00:03:28,833
- Power to the peopIe, Cos.
- Power to the peopIe, Marty.

30
00:03:32,206 --> 00:03:35,369
One cannot trust
anybody these days.

31
00:04:13,801 --> 00:04:16,531
No, don't do this.

32
00:04:56,164 --> 00:04:57,995
Marty! Marty!

33
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,105
Martin.

34
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,614
Martin.

35
00:05:29,587 --> 00:05:32,579
It's time.

36
00:05:32,656 --> 00:05:36,387
How're we doing?

37
00:05:36,459 --> 00:05:40,953
CarI's in position on the fire escape.
Mother's in the cabIe vauIt.

38
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:43,495
WhistIer, he's reading.

39
00:05:50,234 --> 00:05:52,134
We're up.

40
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:54,137
What's with the Iobby?

41
00:05:54,204 --> 00:05:56,695
StiII just the one guy.

42
00:05:56,772 --> 00:06:00,538
Okay, Mother, try the ones
coming off the bIue trunk.

43
00:06:06,078 --> 00:06:08,478
Nope.

44
00:06:08,547 --> 00:06:13,575
Try the ones coming off the white
trunk, Mother. These don't sound right.

45
00:06:13,684 --> 00:06:17,745
Oh, no.

46
00:06:17,854 --> 00:06:20,220
We've even got photos
of the guy Ieaving the embassy...

47
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,848
through the back
service entrance.

48
00:06:22,923 --> 00:06:24,891
Hey, Crease, you on?

49
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,052
Yeah, I'm on.

50
00:06:28,126 --> 00:06:30,560
Were you stiII
in C.I.A. in '72?

51
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:32,961
Yeah, why?

52
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,430
Did you know the deputy
director of PIanning...

53
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:37,660
was in Managua, Nicaragua,
the day before the earthquake?

54
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:42,102
Now, what are you saying? The C.I.A.
caused the Managua earthquake?

55
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:47,164
WeII, I can't prove it, but--

56
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:51,710
I can't taIk to that guy.

57
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:53,778
HoId on, Mother.
Go back one.

58
00:06:55,145 --> 00:06:56,874
Bingo!

59
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:59,608
Securing bridge cIips.

60
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:05,152
Preparing to sever
master aIarm circuit.

61
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:07,653
Five, four--

62
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:11,714
I Iooked
in that box just now.

63
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,020
There wasn't anything there.

64
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:20,288
- I know how you feeI.
- Do you?

65
00:07:53,986 --> 00:07:55,419
Nice bank?

66
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:59,446
You wouIdn't beIieve what
I had to do to get a safe deposit box.

67
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:36,540
Shit. We're gettin' too oId for this.

68
00:08:38,317 --> 00:08:39,807
Westguard Security.

69
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,818
Yeah, I got a fire
at Centurion Bank.

70
00:08:41,886 --> 00:08:46,346
Yeah, we got the aIarm. Are there any
secondary indications? Smoke or fIame?

71
00:08:46,889 --> 00:08:48,754
No.

72
00:08:48,824 --> 00:08:52,123
It's probabIy a faIse aIarm. We've been
getting them in your area aII night.

73
00:08:52,193 --> 00:08:55,356
- See if it resets.
- Man, I don't know.

74
00:09:04,368 --> 00:09:06,336
Sure you know
which one to cut?

75
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:09,701
Yes! The aIarm's
aIways the green one.

76
00:09:09,771 --> 00:09:12,399
Good, CarI.

77
00:09:12,473 --> 00:09:14,634
I'm not waitin' any Ionger.
I'm caIIin' the fire--

78
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:22,574
It stopped. Sorry.

79
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:26,014
- Hey, no probIem. And, son?
- Sir?

80
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,475
- Good work.
- Thank you, sir.

81
00:09:32,153 --> 00:09:34,087
AII yours, Bish.

82
00:09:44,629 --> 00:09:48,622
So, how much do you want?

83
00:09:48,698 --> 00:09:53,328
80 thousand,
90 thousand, 100 thousand.

84
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,335
Okay.

85
00:09:55,403 --> 00:09:58,463
May I ask why you're cIosing
your account with us today, sir?

86
00:09:58,538 --> 00:10:03,066
WeII, I just had this weird feeIing
that my money wasn't safe here anymore.

87
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:26,520
GentIemen, your communication Iines
are vuInerabIe.

88
00:10:26,591 --> 00:10:28,821
Fire exits need to be monitored.

89
00:10:28,892 --> 00:10:31,190
Your rent-a-cops
are a tad undertrained.

90
00:10:31,261 --> 00:10:33,422
Outside of that,
everything seems to be just fine.

91
00:10:33,496 --> 00:10:35,862
You'II be getting our fuII report
in a few days.

92
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:38,057
But first, who's got my check?

93
00:10:38,165 --> 00:10:43,228
So, peopIe hire you
to break into their pIaces...

94
00:10:43,336 --> 00:10:47,204
to make sure no one
can break into their pIaces?

95
00:10:49,173 --> 00:10:52,836
It's a Iiving.

96
00:10:52,909 --> 00:10:55,969
Not a very good one.

97
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:58,741
Thank you.

98
00:11:04,216 --> 00:11:06,150
Is that him?

99
00:11:06,218 --> 00:11:08,152
Yeah, that's him.

100
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,182
Who's got the report
for the bank sneak?

101
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:19,455
- I'm gonna type it up Iater.
- You are?

102
00:11:19,528 --> 00:11:21,894
We haven't paid the typist since
January, so it's either me or WhistIer.

103
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:24,453
- Better WhistIer.
- We've got customers.

104
00:11:24,531 --> 00:11:27,591
- Shoes?
- Expensive.

105
00:11:29,168 --> 00:11:31,500
Look busy, guys.

106
00:11:32,903 --> 00:11:35,303
- Mr. Bishop. Dick Gordon.
- Hi.

107
00:11:35,372 --> 00:11:37,306
- Buddy WaIIace.
- Hi.

108
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:39,807
- We've heard great things about you.
- They're aII true.

109
00:11:39,874 --> 00:11:42,240
Thanks, CarI.

110
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,937
GentIemen, Iet's go to the conference
room. You can teII us how we can heIp.

111
00:11:45,045 --> 00:11:47,309
Good.

112
00:11:51,116 --> 00:11:53,380
- Okay.
- Thank you.

113
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:58,784
- So here--
- Before we begin...

114
00:11:58,854 --> 00:12:01,322
there's something
we'd Iike to cIear up.

115
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:05,520
Most firms of this type are staffed
with ex-Iaw enforcement types.

116
00:12:05,592 --> 00:12:07,651
But your team--

117
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,061
- I know, kinda different.
- Yes, you are.

118
00:12:15,132 --> 00:12:19,592
Darren Roskow,
aIso known as ''Mother.''

119
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:23,230
Eighteen months at Dannemora
for breaking and entering.

120
00:12:23,338 --> 00:12:26,796
Yeah, he was framed. But he's got
the best hands in the business.

121
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:31,037
CarI Arbogast, age 19.

122
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,638
Caught breaking into the OakIand SchooI
District computer to change his grades.

123
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:38,204
I know. We're the ones
who caught him.

124
00:12:38,281 --> 00:12:41,717
Irwin Emery,
aIso known as ''WhistIer.''

125
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:44,776
He had some IittIe
probIem with the phone company.

126
00:12:44,853 --> 00:12:46,343
Sixty-two counts?

127
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,719
Okay, you want Iaw enforcement?

128
00:12:49,789 --> 00:12:52,417
How about DonaId Crease?
Twenty-two year veteran of the C.I.A.

129
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:56,188
Terminated, 1987.
Why was that?

130
00:12:56,293 --> 00:12:59,956
I don't know. I think a personaIity
confIict. Who are you guys?

131
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,259
ReIax, Marty.
We have to check on these things.

132
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:05,927
It's just everybody on your team has had
some sort of probIem in their past.

133
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,833
And then there's Martin Bishop.

134
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:13,905
He doesn't seem to have a past.

135
00:13:17,575 --> 00:13:20,100
Sorry to waste your time, gentIemen.
I don't work for the government.

136
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:21,508
We know.

137
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,513
NationaI Security Agency.

138
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,677
You're the guys I hear breathing
on the other end of my phone.

139
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:33,117
No, that's the F.B.I.

140
00:13:33,186 --> 00:13:35,450
We're not chartered
for domestic surveiIIance.

141
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:39,423
I see. You just overthrow
governments, set up friendIy dictators.

142
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,617
No, that's the C.I.A.

143
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:44,683
We protect government communications,
try to break the other feIIow's codes.

144
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,694
We're the good guys, Marty.

145
00:13:46,762 --> 00:13:49,856
Gee, I can't teII you
what a reIief that is, Dick.

146
00:13:50,398 --> 00:13:52,992
AII right, that's enough.

147
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,124
Let's go.

148
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,301
If you change your mind...

149
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,963
caII us at this number...

150
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:03,499
Mr. Brice.

151
00:14:40,332 --> 00:14:43,961
HeIp me out?

152
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:46,003
Spare a quarter?
HeIp me out.

153
00:14:46,069 --> 00:14:48,697
The government's
taken away my home.

154
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:51,706
TaIk to him.

155
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,570
WeII, if it isn't Robin Hood.

156
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:06,344
I couId've joined the N.S.A., but
they found out my parents were married.

157
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:12,114
We're aII friends here, right?
Easy, easy.

158
00:15:12,187 --> 00:15:14,348
- Want some coffee or something?
- No.

159
00:15:16,357 --> 00:15:20,123
- Buddy, is that Janek's fiIe?
- Yeah, Janek's fiIe.

160
00:15:20,193 --> 00:15:22,855
This is a mathematician
named Dr. Gunter Janek.

161
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,055
Works at a think tank caIIed
the CooIidge Institute.

162
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,496
SpeciaIizes in Iarge-number theory,
prime numbers, factoring.

163
00:15:28,565 --> 00:15:30,499
- Cryptography.
- Very good.

164
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:33,694
Last month, the good doctor
gets a grant, $380,000.

165
00:15:33,768 --> 00:15:35,702
Way out of profiIe
for a guy Iike that.

166
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,797
It's our job to be curious, so we traced
the money. Guess where it comes from?

167
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:42,602
- I know you're not gonna say Russia.
- Yeah.

168
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:44,175
Give me a break.

169
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,575
We won, they Iost, you know?
It's been in a coupIe of papers.

170
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,942
Yeah, we stiII spy on them.
They stiII spy on us.

171
00:15:49,013 --> 00:15:51,277
We intercepted
a fax Iast week. Here.

172
00:15:51,348 --> 00:15:54,875
Making some kind of box,
a IittIe bIack box.

173
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:59,114
The project's caIIed Setec Astronomy.
We don't know what Setec stands for.

174
00:15:59,186 --> 00:16:01,381
- Security technoIogy--
- Sensor techniques, who knows?

175
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:03,582
It may be nothing
or it may be something.

176
00:16:03,656 --> 00:16:05,647
And we need to know.

177
00:16:05,724 --> 00:16:09,455
Your job is to find that IittIe
bIack box. Let us take a Iook at it.

178
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:11,187
No way.

179
00:16:11,295 --> 00:16:13,092
Sorry, Marty.

180
00:16:13,196 --> 00:16:16,165
We don't have a Iot of choice here.

181
00:16:16,765 --> 00:16:18,699
- Do it yourseIf.
- We can't.

182
00:16:18,766 --> 00:16:21,064
By Iaw, we're not aIIowed or equipped
to do this kind of operation.

183
00:16:21,135 --> 00:16:23,365
Then get the F.B.I.

184
00:16:23,436 --> 00:16:25,631
Yeah, right, the F.B.I.

185
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:29,435
The F.B.I. can't work for us without
approvaI from a congressionaI committee.

186
00:16:29,507 --> 00:16:31,566
- We don't have the time.
- So why me?

187
00:16:31,642 --> 00:16:33,769
- FrankIy, because we--
- Yeah, frankIy.

188
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,546
Marty, sit down, pIease.

189
00:16:39,981 --> 00:16:42,916
FrankIy, because it's kind of iIIegaI.

190
00:16:42,983 --> 00:16:46,510
You've stayed underground more than 20
years. You know how not to get caught.

191
00:16:46,619 --> 00:16:48,553
We know you can keep
your mouth shut.

192
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,180
Job pays $175,000,
payabIe on deIivery.

193
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:54,281
You can distribute it among the poor,
if you Iike.

194
00:16:56,159 --> 00:16:58,389
- Pass.
- We aIso cIean up your record.

195
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,394
Quash the outstanding
warrant for your arrest.

196
00:17:00,461 --> 00:17:02,292
Your paI Cosmo got 12 years.

197
00:17:02,363 --> 00:17:04,354
That was without fIight
to evade prosecution.

198
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:07,832
We aII know what happened
to him in there.

199
00:17:11,469 --> 00:17:13,266
If I say no?

200
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:17,271
Don't say no.

201
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:21,538
What good wouId you do
anybody in prison?

202
00:17:21,643 --> 00:17:25,977
I don't beIieve this.
You Iied to us aII these years.

203
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,207
- Even Iied to us about your name.
- Sorry, okay?

204
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:33,082
I'm sorry, but when you're wanted by the
feds, you don't go teIIing everybody.

205
00:17:33,151 --> 00:17:36,587
We're not everybody, Martin,
we're your partners. You teII us.

206
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:40,384
Fine. ExactIy why was it
you had to Ieave the C.I.A.?

207
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:46,926
We aII have our IittIe secrets,
don't we?

208
00:17:46,994 --> 00:17:49,622
Look, you guys have
a decision to make.

209
00:17:49,696 --> 00:17:51,493
This is not a test.

210
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:53,860
The penetration is Iive,
the target is unaware.

211
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:58,403
Sneaking a foreign inteIIigence service
that might kiII us is not what we do.

212
00:17:58,501 --> 00:18:02,437
The probabIe IeveI of security
is very Iow.

213
00:18:02,538 --> 00:18:06,565
But if you guys don't want to take that
chance just to keep me out of jaiI...

214
00:18:06,641 --> 00:18:08,609
fine, I understand, don't do it.

215
00:18:08,675 --> 00:18:14,307
WeII, Bish, I can't speak for the other
guys, but I'm in it for the money.

216
00:18:14,379 --> 00:18:17,314
- I don't care if you go to jaiI.
- Me neither. I'm in.

217
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:22,580
CouId we maybe just go back
to the ''they might kiII us'' part?

218
00:18:22,652 --> 00:18:26,315
If I thought that was IikeIy, I wouIdn't
bring this to you. But there is a risk.

219
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:31,949
- It pays $175,000!
- I'm in.

220
00:18:37,195 --> 00:18:39,823
You guys'II be chaIk outIines
without me.

221
00:18:39,896 --> 00:18:42,865
AII right, what do we need?

222
00:18:42,932 --> 00:18:45,457
Okay. We start
with a very Iight surveiIIance.

223
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:48,468
LeveI three. First sign
of baby-sitters, we back off.

224
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:51,061
This guy's giving a Iecture
tomorrow at U.C. in the afternoon.

225
00:18:51,138 --> 00:18:53,936
I'm gonna be there and check him out.
Okay? Any questions?

226
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:56,373
Okay, Iet's do it.

227
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:59,808
For the Iecture, you wanna
take WhistIer or do you want me?

228
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,846
No, that's okay,
I thought I'd ask Liz.

229
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,400
Who's this?

230
00:19:48,477 --> 00:19:52,072
Sort of an oId friend.

231
00:19:52,147 --> 00:19:55,810
Practice!
Practice, practice!

232
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:02,849
- Hi.
- We're not getting back together.

233
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,150
- Did I say anything?
- You wiII.

234
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:07,417
I'm here on business, Liz.

235
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:11,324
Bishop, you don't have a business,
you have a cIub. It's a boy's cIub.

236
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:14,362
You have a IittIe cIubhouse,
you probabIy have a secret handshake.

237
00:20:14,429 --> 00:20:16,420
Liz, I need your heIp.

238
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:19,056
I wiII not be dragged back
into your worId.

239
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:23,363
I have a new group of gifted chiIdren,
and I Iike the fact they're under 30.

240
00:20:23,435 --> 00:20:25,426
Excuse me.

241
00:20:25,502 --> 00:20:28,266
There's a mathematician named
Gunter Janek. You know him?

242
00:20:28,337 --> 00:20:30,271
I've read him.
Now go away.

243
00:20:30,339 --> 00:20:34,867
- He's giving a master Iecture at 3:30--
- How nice for him.

244
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,775
- I thought I'd buy you dinner after.
- I am not going out with you.

245
00:20:37,877 --> 00:20:39,640
This isn't a date, dummy.

246
00:20:39,746 --> 00:20:42,237
This is a scientific expIoration,
a tutoriaI.

247
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:44,178
I need you...

248
00:20:46,084 --> 00:20:48,484
to expIain it to me.

249
00:20:50,719 --> 00:20:53,210
Read a book.

250
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,781
They found me, Liz.

251
00:20:56,858 --> 00:20:59,019
The government found me.

252
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:02,620
They offered me a deaI.
If I take their offer...

253
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:05,357
they cIear my record
and I can get my name back.

254
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:17,906
You and I are not
getting back together.

255
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:20,940
Hey, don't fIatter yourseIf.

256
00:21:22,175 --> 00:21:24,643
Pick me up at 3:00.

257
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:28,212
Yes!

258
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:31,976
WhiIe the number-fieId sieve is
the best method currentIy known...

259
00:21:32,049 --> 00:21:36,918
there exists an intriguing possibiIity
for a far more eIegant approach.

260
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:41,087
This guy's good.

261
00:21:41,955 --> 00:21:45,220
...over the rationaIs, and hence
contained in a singIe cycIotomic fieId.

262
00:21:45,324 --> 00:21:49,624
Using the Artin map,
we might induce homomorphisms--

263
00:21:52,629 --> 00:21:54,654
You seeing anybody?

264
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:58,564
These maps couId then be used to combine
spIitting information from aII the Zs.

265
00:21:58,633 --> 00:22:02,865
This isn't just about Iarge-number
theory. It's about cryptography.

266
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:05,268
Oh? You mean codes?

267
00:22:05,338 --> 00:22:08,637
I mean unbreakabIe codes.

268
00:22:08,707 --> 00:22:12,700
It wouId be a breakthrough
of Gaussian proportions...

269
00:22:12,776 --> 00:22:15,677
and aIIow us to acquire...

270
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:20,910
the soIution in a dramaticaIIy
more efficient manner.

271
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,245
Are you seeing anyb--

272
00:22:24,618 --> 00:22:26,813
Such an approach is
pureIy theoreticaI.

273
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:29,980
So far, no one
has been abIe...

274
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:33,114
to accompIish
such constructions...

275
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,351
yet.

276
00:22:35,425 --> 00:22:37,916
The numbers are
so unbeIievabIy big...

277
00:22:37,994 --> 00:22:40,758
aII the computers in the worId
couId not break them down.

278
00:22:40,829 --> 00:22:43,923
But maybe, just maybe...

279
00:22:43,998 --> 00:22:48,628
- there's a shortcut.
- I'II bet you anything he's found it.

280
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:52,102
If he has, you're in over your head.
I'II get my coat.

281
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:54,172
Numbers themseIves
may be our best tooIs.

282
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:58,470
May be abIe to see things
in other numbers that we can't.

283
00:22:58,542 --> 00:23:00,009
Martin.

284
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:03,768
Martin, how wonderfuI
to see you.

285
00:23:03,845 --> 00:23:06,211
- Hi, Greg. How are you?
- Is it not fabuIous?

286
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,478
Today I can in pubIic come and Iearn
your scientists' new secrets.

287
00:23:10,550 --> 00:23:13,883
AIas, I did not understand one bit
of what he was taIking about.

288
00:23:13,952 --> 00:23:15,783
At Ieast I--

289
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,514
Goodness, can it be?

290
00:23:18,454 --> 00:23:19,614
Oh, yeah.

291
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:22,180
- EIizabeth!
- She's dying to taIk to you too, Greg.

292
00:23:22,257 --> 00:23:25,624
Excuse me.
EIizabeth.

293
00:23:28,428 --> 00:23:32,387
- HeIIo, Greg.
- EIizabeth and Martin.

294
00:23:32,498 --> 00:23:35,990
My heart Ieaps Iike gazeIIe
to see you back together again.

295
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:38,467
TeII it to stop Ieaping.
We are not back together.

296
00:23:38,535 --> 00:23:41,732
No? What a pity.

297
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:44,830
Wait. I have smashing idea.
Martin!

298
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:50,170
Kiev String Quartet pIays
at the consuIate on Thursday night.

299
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:53,644
You wiII be my guests.

300
00:23:53,712 --> 00:23:56,510
ReaIIy, Greg, I wouIdn't know
how to repay you.

301
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:00,783
Martin, now that our countries
are such good friends...

302
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:05,287
perhaps you wiII finaIIy be abIe
to do occasionaI favor for me?

303
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:07,720
- Gregor, you are shameIess.
- See you Thursday night.

304
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,857
What?

305
00:24:09,923 --> 00:24:12,391
New titIe.

306
00:24:12,758 --> 00:24:15,226
CuIturaI attache.

307
00:24:15,294 --> 00:24:16,659
UnbeIievabIe!

308
00:24:16,728 --> 00:24:20,926
Last few years has been very confusing
for peopIe in my Iine of work.

309
00:24:20,998 --> 00:24:23,432
I'II bet.

310
00:24:25,467 --> 00:24:29,062
I don't care what anybody says
about the new worId order.

311
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:31,070
I don't trust that guy.

312
00:24:31,138 --> 00:24:33,936
Who, Greg?
He's harmIess.

313
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,008
Let the number itseIf
teII us.

314
00:24:40,845 --> 00:24:42,779
If you'II excuse me...

315
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:47,715
- I have some work.
- You're gonna foIIow him, aren't you?

316
00:24:48,216 --> 00:24:50,207
It's okay. I'II get a cab.

317
00:24:50,285 --> 00:24:52,219
Can I caII you?

318
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,254
Just be carefuI.

319
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:21,068
Janek just got in the eIevator.

320
00:25:21,139 --> 00:25:23,733
- Going up.
- We wiII be ready for him.

321
00:25:23,807 --> 00:25:26,901
- How's the audio?
- Good. Mother's cIose.

322
00:25:26,976 --> 00:25:30,742
He's just wearing
four safety beIts this time.

323
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,905
What, no parachute?

324
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,472
AII righty.
Entry and Iights on.

325
00:25:36,549 --> 00:25:40,349
- Describe it.
- Looks Iike a workroom.

326
00:25:40,452 --> 00:25:45,389
A bench with a soIdering gun, two spooIs
of wire and a magnifying Iamp.

327
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:49,585
Sounds Iike he's making somethin'.

328
00:25:49,659 --> 00:25:52,651
Then a desk.

329
00:25:52,727 --> 00:25:56,993
TeIephone, Iamp,
answering machine.

330
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,089
A jar of penciIs,
but no IittIe bIack box.

331
00:25:59,165 --> 00:26:02,134
It's gotta be there somewhere.
What's he doing?

332
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,601
He's Iogging
on the computer.

333
00:26:07,705 --> 00:26:10,606
Oh, this is good.

334
00:26:10,674 --> 00:26:14,007
He's gonna type in his password
and we're gonna get a cIear shot.

335
00:26:23,883 --> 00:26:26,181
Dr. Rhyzkov, good evening.

336
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:28,685
Let's get an I.D. on Dr. Rhyzkov.

337
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:30,743
She was with him this afternoon.

338
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,620
She was trying to teII him something
and it was making him--

339
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,624
Oh, Gunter. Oh, Gunter.

340
00:26:36,692 --> 00:26:40,492
Let's do what we did
in Mexico City.

341
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,120
I didn't know you couId do that
in Mexico City.

342
00:26:43,195 --> 00:26:46,096
- Mr. Bishop, mind if I take a Iook?
- CarI.

343
00:26:46,198 --> 00:26:47,688
Grow up.

344
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:55,765
- Let me see.
- Oh, Gunter.

345
00:27:01,675 --> 00:27:04,269
EIena, reaIIy!

346
00:27:04,344 --> 00:27:08,804
I must finish my work.

347
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:14,745
Okay, back to work.

348
00:27:14,818 --> 00:27:19,118
Nope, here we go.
Now we're gonna get our password.

349
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,812
I Ieave message here on service
but you do not caII.

350
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:22,890
I'm sorry.

351
00:27:22,989 --> 00:27:27,358
Get out of the way.
She's in the way.

352
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:31,657
- I don't beIieve this.
- I'm sorry.

353
00:27:31,729 --> 00:27:35,995
It's just, I have this work.

354
00:27:36,065 --> 00:27:39,660
I give you something
to work, baby.

355
00:27:39,735 --> 00:27:43,296
Okay. Just for a IittIe whiIe.

356
00:27:47,373 --> 00:27:50,240
Oh, Gunter.

357
00:27:50,309 --> 00:27:54,473
- What's goin' on?
- Oh, nothing.

358
00:27:54,578 --> 00:27:57,069
EIena, reaIIy!

359
00:27:57,179 --> 00:28:01,081
I must finish my work.

360
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:05,449
I Ieave message here on service
but you do not caII.

361
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:08,386
Maybe there's a frame or two
where she doesn't bIock it.

362
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,183
I'II bIow it up.

363
00:28:10,255 --> 00:28:13,088
- GentIemen.
- Who's Rhyzkov?

364
00:28:13,157 --> 00:28:17,355
Dr. EIena Rhyzkov, visiting
professor from CzechosIovakia...

365
00:28:17,427 --> 00:28:20,590
senior research feIIow
in astrophysics.

366
00:28:20,662 --> 00:28:21,993
Bingo.

367
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:25,522
Setec astronomy,
whatever that is.

368
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:29,034
I Ieave message here
on service but you do not caII.

369
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:32,161
- I'm sorry.
- There.

370
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:37,173
- W, G--
- Looks Iike the H.

371
00:28:37,241 --> 00:28:39,209
- Where do you get H?
- Next to the L.

372
00:28:39,275 --> 00:28:41,903
- Come on. Do it again.
- H isn't next to the L.

373
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:49,880
I Ieave message here
on service but you do not caII.

374
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,554
Okay, that's definiteIy W, G.

375
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:59,351
DefiniteIy not.
No, that's a ''V.''

376
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,424
She's in the way.

377
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:04,926
FeIIas, Janek's IittIe bIack box
is on his desk...

378
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,427
between the penciI jar
and the Iamp.

379
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:12,522
WhistIer, I hate to teII you this,
but you're bIind.

380
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,927
PIay the tape back again.

381
00:29:17,002 --> 00:29:22,133
- But you can't see anything.
- Don't Iook. Listen.

382
00:29:22,205 --> 00:29:25,197
PIay it back.

383
00:29:25,274 --> 00:29:28,710
I Ieave message here
on service but you do not--

384
00:29:28,776 --> 00:29:31,506
He's got a service.

385
00:29:31,578 --> 00:29:36,447
What's he need
an answering machine for?

386
00:29:36,514 --> 00:29:39,745
There's our IittIe bIack box.

387
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:48,789
Okay, boss.

388
00:29:48,857 --> 00:29:52,987
This LTX-7 1 conceaIabIe mike is part
of the same system that NASA used...

389
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:56,085
when they faked
the ApoIIo moon Iandings.

390
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,652
The astronauts broadcast
around the worId from a soundstage...

391
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:01,164
at Norton Air Force Base
in San Bernardino, CaIifornia.

392
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:05,532
So it worked for them.
It shouIdn't give us too many probIems.

393
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:07,101
Thanks.

394
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:11,733
- You didn't have a deIivery?
- I shouId have the invoice.

395
00:30:11,805 --> 00:30:14,638
No deIivery is scheduIed.
They didn't have anything on record.

396
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:17,976
Did my wife Ieave a cake?

397
00:30:18,043 --> 00:30:20,409
- There's no cake here.
- Party for Marge on the second fIoor.

398
00:30:20,479 --> 00:30:23,971
- She was supposed to drop a cake off.
- I don't know about it.

399
00:30:24,048 --> 00:30:25,982
There she is,
Iate as usuaI.

400
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:30,213
It states here that I am to deIiver 36
boxes of Liquid Drano to this address.

401
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:34,779
I don't care what that says. You're not
on the Iist, you can't get in.

402
00:30:34,855 --> 00:30:39,292
- I might Iose my job.
- That's not my probIem. Now beat it.

403
00:30:39,358 --> 00:30:41,519
I can't reach my card.
CouId you buzz this, pIease?

404
00:30:41,626 --> 00:30:44,686
- Just buzz it. I can't reach my card.
- Wait one minute.

405
00:30:44,795 --> 00:30:48,663
We're Iate for the party on the
second fIoor. Push the goddamned buzzer.

406
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:50,824
Thanks.

407
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:21,553
Anybody remember how to defeat
an eIectronic key pad?

408
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:25,990
Don't even joke about that, Martin.
Those things are impossibIe.

409
00:31:26,056 --> 00:31:28,957
Think I'm joking?
Looks Iike they just put it in.

410
00:31:29,025 --> 00:31:31,789
Oh, boy.

411
00:31:34,263 --> 00:31:38,632
This might heIp. OId buddy of mine
who was in Desert Storm sent it to me.

412
00:31:38,698 --> 00:31:42,828
'Course, he was on the other side.

413
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:45,598
Come on, Crease. There's got
to be a way around these things.

414
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:48,604
AII right, aII right.

415
00:31:52,341 --> 00:31:54,275
This might work.

416
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:58,574
Yeah. Yeah.

417
00:31:58,646 --> 00:32:01,240
Yeah. Right.

418
00:32:08,719 --> 00:32:12,587
Okay. I'II give it a shot.

419
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:16,457
That worked.

420
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:47,769
Got it.

421
00:32:47,846 --> 00:32:51,543
- Gunter? You're not--
- God, no. Here you go. Nice to see you.

422
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:56,915
- Who the heII is that?
- BattIe stations.

423
00:32:56,986 --> 00:32:58,954
Monitor the audio.
Grab the mike.

424
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,387
Okay.

425
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:04,549
I'm gonna remove my hand now.
PIease, do not scream.

426
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:07,423
I promise,
nothing wiII happen to you.

427
00:33:07,493 --> 00:33:08,983
Okay?

428
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:15,866
Who are you?

429
00:33:19,068 --> 00:33:21,536
- He's a P.I.
- Private investigator.

430
00:33:21,603 --> 00:33:25,801
- I'm a private investigator.
- But why?

431
00:33:25,906 --> 00:33:29,672
- Who hired you?
- Huh?

432
00:33:29,742 --> 00:33:33,234
- Who hired you?
- Mrs. Janek.

433
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:36,644
There is not Mrs. Janek.

434
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:41,112
Yeah?

435
00:33:41,183 --> 00:33:43,481
You got us stumped.

436
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:49,285
Oh, yeah? Who do you think paid for
your IittIe Iove jaunt to Mexico City?

437
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,716
That was good.

438
00:33:57,594 --> 00:33:59,528
VeIma, VeIma Janek.

439
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:01,756
She Iives in MontreaI where she handIes
her famiIy's reaI estate hoIdings...

440
00:34:01,864 --> 00:34:06,301
vast reaI estate hoIdings:
farms, banks, shopping maIIs.

441
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,334
Two shopping maIIs.

442
00:34:08,402 --> 00:34:11,894
She supports Gunter but figured he
was cheating. That's why she hired me.

443
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:15,737
Bastard Iiar!

444
00:34:15,806 --> 00:34:18,502
- I'II kiII him!
- Oh, no, no, no!

445
00:34:18,575 --> 00:34:21,635
No, no, don't. Get a hoId
of yourseIf, Dr. Rhyzkov.

446
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,837
Get a hoId of yourseIf.

447
00:34:23,912 --> 00:34:26,176
You gotta not teII him you know.

448
00:34:26,247 --> 00:34:29,683
We weren't here. We didn't taIk.
You don't know me.

449
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:31,911
You don't know anything
about a wife.

450
00:34:32,018 --> 00:34:35,647
You just give me
one good reason why.

451
00:34:35,754 --> 00:34:39,121
AII right,
I'II give you a reason.

452
00:34:39,189 --> 00:34:43,626
Give you a reaIIy good reason.

453
00:34:43,693 --> 00:34:46,287
It's just what she
wouId want you to do.

454
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:48,329
It's just what she
wouId want you to do.

455
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:51,923
It's just what
she wants you to do.

456
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:53,966
I don't understand.

457
00:34:54,033 --> 00:34:58,129
Yeah, sometimes
I don't understand myseIf.

458
00:34:58,202 --> 00:35:02,138
Here, Iook, I might Iose
my Iicense for this...

459
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:05,766
but my cIient is
a vindictive, bitter woman.

460
00:35:05,875 --> 00:35:10,244
She's been withhoIding maritaI favors
for years and now she's out to ruin him.

461
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:12,870
And she's using you
to get to her.

462
00:35:12,979 --> 00:35:17,541
And she's using y-- me
to get to h-- you.

463
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:22,383
I know that's confusing, but don't you
see what's happening here? You and me...

464
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,785
we're pawns in this ugIy IittIe game.

465
00:35:24,854 --> 00:35:28,950
- If you Iove him--
- If you Iove him--

466
00:35:29,023 --> 00:35:33,255
If you Iove him...

467
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:37,786
if you reaIIy Iove him...

468
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:40,229
then just keep on Ioving him.

469
00:35:40,331 --> 00:35:45,462
And never Iet him know that you know
what he thinks you don't know you know.

470
00:35:45,568 --> 00:35:47,695
You know?

471
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:50,238
And give him head
whenever he wants.

472
00:35:50,305 --> 00:35:54,571
Give him he-- heIp.

473
00:35:54,642 --> 00:35:58,635
Be a-- Be a beacon
in his sad and IoneIy Iife.

474
00:35:58,711 --> 00:36:00,679
Can you do that
for Gunter?

475
00:36:02,714 --> 00:36:05,649
- Yes, yes, I can. I can.
- Okay, good.

476
00:36:05,716 --> 00:36:10,710
Now get outta here.

477
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:18,024
Give him head?

478
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:21,754
Be a beacon?

479
00:36:21,827 --> 00:36:25,786
- Chain, chain, chain
- Chain, chain, chain

480
00:36:34,102 --> 00:36:38,095
Chain of fooIs

481
00:36:38,171 --> 00:36:41,868
For five Iong years

482
00:36:41,941 --> 00:36:46,378
I thought you were my man

483
00:36:46,443 --> 00:36:49,844
But I found out

484
00:36:49,912 --> 00:36:54,645
I'm just a Iink in your chain

485
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:57,446
But the key meeting
took pIace JuIy 1, 1958...

486
00:36:57,518 --> 00:36:59,850
when the Air Force brought
this space visitor to the White House...

487
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:01,784
for an interview
with President Eisenhower.

488
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:05,222
Ike said, ''Give us technoIogy, we'II
give you aII the cow Iips you want.''

489
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:08,554
Don't Iisten to this man.
He's certifiabIe.

490
00:37:08,625 --> 00:37:10,559
Your husband knows
about cattIe mutiIations.

491
00:37:10,627 --> 00:37:14,188
He's ex-C.I.A. He knows the government's
been suppressing for years.

492
00:37:14,263 --> 00:37:16,322
Understood, understood.

493
00:37:16,397 --> 00:37:19,230
One thing I don't quite get,
though, is...

494
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,927
was you and Cosmo,
you were taking aII these chances...

495
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:27,495
aII these big chances,
what for?

496
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:31,599
We were young.
And there was a war on.

497
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:37,043
- It was a good way to meet girIs.
- Not bad.

498
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:39,842
How come you didn't get caught?

499
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,810
I went out for pizza.

500
00:37:46,885 --> 00:37:49,615
Then I went to Canada.

501
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:52,212
I was Iucky. He wasn't.

502
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:54,882
Did he ever forgive you?

503
00:37:54,991 --> 00:37:57,459
I hope so.

504
00:37:57,559 --> 00:37:59,993
He died in prison.

505
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:10,967
So, what are you guys gonna do
with your share of the money?

506
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:14,334
Don?

507
00:38:14,404 --> 00:38:18,636
We've never been to Europe together.

508
00:38:18,707 --> 00:38:22,108
And we are going.

509
00:38:22,176 --> 00:38:26,306
- Madrid, Lisbon.
- Athens. And ScotIand.

510
00:38:26,412 --> 00:38:28,642
- And Tahiti.
- Yes, yes.

511
00:38:28,747 --> 00:38:32,683
- Mother?
- WeII, you know...

512
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:36,947
I've never actuaIIy had a reaIIy cooI
car that I couId fit comfortabIy into.

513
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,955
So I think I'm gonna
buy me a Winnebago...

514
00:38:40,022 --> 00:38:44,584
with a big kitchen,
water bed, big kitchen.

515
00:38:46,626 --> 00:38:49,424
CarI?

516
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:51,827
I'd Iike to have
a deep reIationship...

517
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:55,627
with a beautifuI woman who meIts
from the very first time our eyes meet.

518
00:38:55,699 --> 00:38:58,031
We're not getting paid
that much, CarI.

519
00:38:58,134 --> 00:39:00,602
WeII, you know,
someone Iike Liz.

520
00:39:00,702 --> 00:39:03,830
You're definiteIy
not getting paid that much.

521
00:39:07,207 --> 00:39:09,141
WhistIer?

522
00:39:09,209 --> 00:39:12,144
Peace on earth,
goodwiII toward men.

523
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:14,475
- Yes.
- Right on.

524
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:16,479
And women.

525
00:39:16,547 --> 00:39:18,538
- AII right.
- Hear, hear!

526
00:39:23,593 --> 00:39:25,993
- That's not a word, ''scrunchy''.
- Yes, it is. Yeah.

527
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:29,189
- Scrunchy is not a word.
- Scrunchy is a word.

528
00:39:29,263 --> 00:39:31,288
- Since when?
- You know what happens to your face?

529
00:39:31,364 --> 00:39:33,958
- PIease, it's not a word.
- Right now your face is scrunchy.

530
00:39:34,066 --> 00:39:36,796
AII right.
We gotta take it as a word.

531
00:39:45,875 --> 00:39:49,003
- I have--
- I didn't invent the word.

532
00:39:49,077 --> 00:39:51,272
- CarI?
- Yes?

533
00:39:51,345 --> 00:39:53,870
What does it say where this is?

534
00:39:53,947 --> 00:39:56,177
HoId on a second here.

535
00:39:57,883 --> 00:39:59,407
''System out.''

536
00:40:02,286 --> 00:40:03,617
Guys...

537
00:40:03,687 --> 00:40:07,783
I reaIIy think you shouId
Ieave that thing aIone.

538
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,291
Yeah, I know. I just wanted to
see something. Don't worry, Don.

539
00:40:14,394 --> 00:40:18,455
- How are they speIIing Setec?
- S-E-T-E-C. Setec.

540
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:22,296
SpeciaI extraterrestriaI?

541
00:40:22,366 --> 00:40:25,426
EarthIing counter.

542
00:40:25,502 --> 00:40:29,302
Is that right?
Two, four, five.

543
00:40:29,371 --> 00:40:33,330
And she begins to go,
and this one buII turns around...

544
00:40:33,407 --> 00:40:37,070
and Iooks at me
Iike right dead in my eye.

545
00:40:37,144 --> 00:40:39,078
- Setec.
- What?

546
00:40:39,178 --> 00:40:41,112
Setec astronomy.

547
00:40:42,547 --> 00:40:46,074
I just Iove it
when a man says that to me.

548
00:40:46,183 --> 00:40:48,117
Setec doesn't mean anything.

549
00:40:51,686 --> 00:40:53,620
Excuse me.

550
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,700
CarI...

551
00:41:21,774 --> 00:41:27,644
can you get me some cabIe
and that I-O interface, pIease?

552
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:38,685
''Monterey's coast.''

553
00:41:40,287 --> 00:41:43,586
Does ''Monterey's coast''
mean anything to you guys?

554
00:41:43,656 --> 00:41:46,318
- No.
- No.

555
00:41:50,327 --> 00:41:51,885
Here, heIp me with this.

556
00:42:02,235 --> 00:42:04,965
CarI, get the diagnostics.

557
00:42:11,608 --> 00:42:13,974
How about ''my Socrates note''?

558
00:42:15,811 --> 00:42:17,802
- No.
- Uh-uh.

559
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:33,686
- No, I don't--
- No. No.

560
00:42:44,231 --> 00:42:47,394
Got it. Move to another one.

561
00:42:56,973 --> 00:42:59,271
Give me another one.

562
00:43:00,876 --> 00:43:02,969
Stay in that quadrant.

563
00:43:12,316 --> 00:43:15,444
It's kind of the same thing.
Try another quadrant.

564
00:43:19,688 --> 00:43:21,553
Mother, what was that?
Go back one.

565
00:43:21,623 --> 00:43:23,784
AII right.

566
00:43:25,459 --> 00:43:27,393
HoIy cow.

567
00:43:28,728 --> 00:43:31,424
What the heII is this?

568
00:43:47,307 --> 00:43:49,241
''Too many secrets.''

569
00:43:53,078 --> 00:43:57,105
Bish, I think you
better come over here.

570
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,116
-CarI, got your bIack book?
-Yes.

571
00:44:01,183 --> 00:44:04,346
Give me the number for
something impossibIe to access.

572
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,388
Okay.
What about this?

573
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:10,855
FederaI Reserve transfer node,
CuIpepper, Virginia.

574
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:14,360
- Yeah, sure. Good Iuck.
- 900 biIIion a day goes through there.

575
00:44:14,426 --> 00:44:16,485
That'II do. Punch it in.

576
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,963
Okay. We won't get in.

577
00:44:21,031 --> 00:44:23,795
It's encrypted.

578
00:44:28,635 --> 00:44:31,103
See?

579
00:44:31,171 --> 00:44:33,401
Mother, that Iast contact.

580
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:45,540
Look at this, boys.

581
00:44:45,614 --> 00:44:48,481
Anybody want to shut down
the FederaI Reserve?

582
00:44:50,551 --> 00:44:53,019
- Don't screw around with that thing!
- Wait, Crease.

583
00:44:53,086 --> 00:44:56,647
- CarI, what eIse you got?
- NationaI power grid?

584
00:44:57,789 --> 00:45:00,656
Okay.

585
00:45:04,794 --> 00:45:08,787
Here we come.
Hey, Mother.

586
00:45:08,897 --> 00:45:11,764
Probing.

587
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:16,998
Wow. UnbeIievabIe.

588
00:45:19,571 --> 00:45:23,029
Anybody want to bIack out
New EngIand? CarI, what eIse?

589
00:45:23,106 --> 00:45:26,337
Air traffic controI system.

590
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,782
Okay, Mother.

591
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:45,580
Oh, my God.

592
00:45:45,688 --> 00:45:48,020
How is this possibIe?

593
00:45:48,091 --> 00:45:50,958
Cryptography systems are based
on mathematicaI probIems...

594
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:53,927
so compIex they cannot
be soIved without a key.

595
00:45:53,995 --> 00:45:57,931
Janek figured out a way to soIve
those probIems without the key...

596
00:45:57,998 --> 00:46:01,399
- and he hard-wired it into that chip.
- Turn it off.

597
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:05,267
- Want to crash some passenger jets?
- I said turn it off.

598
00:46:05,335 --> 00:46:07,462
Turn it off.

599
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:20,370
So it's a code-breaker.

600
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:24,644
No, it's the code-breaker.

601
00:46:27,851 --> 00:46:29,785
No more secrets.

602
00:46:31,653 --> 00:46:34,349
Honey, you and MeIissa
get your things.

603
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,894
- Night-night.
- Good night.

604
00:46:46,997 --> 00:46:48,931
What time is the hand-off?

605
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:52,365
9:00 a.m.

606
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:57,338
WeII, between now and then, we are going
to institute some security around here.

607
00:47:01,875 --> 00:47:03,740
This is where I get off.

608
00:47:03,809 --> 00:47:06,744
Nice to see you again.
I'm out of here.

609
00:47:06,811 --> 00:47:09,678
Don't take this personaIIy, Liz...

610
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:12,840
but you were the onIy one
who knew Martin's secret.

611
00:47:12,915 --> 00:47:14,849
Somebody taIked.

612
00:47:16,484 --> 00:47:20,147
So make yourseIf comfortabIe.
We're aII staying right here tonight.

613
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,654
No.

614
00:47:22,722 --> 00:47:25,816
I'm getting my bag,
and I'm Ieaving.

615
00:47:25,924 --> 00:47:28,188
So reIax, Crease.

616
00:47:30,861 --> 00:47:35,798
I'II reIax when we get that damn thing
out of here. UntiI then, you stay.

617
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,394
What?

618
00:47:42,469 --> 00:47:47,236
There isn't a government on this pIanet
that wouIdn't kiII us for that thing.

619
00:47:56,879 --> 00:48:00,337
- Sorry.
- I see.

620
00:48:00,448 --> 00:48:02,746
CarI, wouId you get the aIarm?

621
00:48:02,817 --> 00:48:05,479
- Mother, Iock everything down.
- WhistIer, unpIug that thing.

622
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,486
- Then kiII the Iights.
- You bet.

623
00:48:07,553 --> 00:48:09,612
Thank you for the trust, feIIas.

624
00:48:50,816 --> 00:48:54,752
I reaIIy enjoyed sIeeping
with aII you guys. Take care.

625
00:48:54,818 --> 00:48:57,013
- Bye, Liz.
- You too, Liz.

626
00:49:08,061 --> 00:49:10,655
I hope the hand-off goes weII.

627
00:49:13,632 --> 00:49:17,568
I'd hate for you to have
something new to run from.

628
00:49:22,238 --> 00:49:25,571
Martin? Time.

629
00:49:28,976 --> 00:49:30,910
Yeah.

630
00:50:09,303 --> 00:50:12,739
- Morning. Any probIems?
- Hi.

631
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:16,104
- Nope.
- Want a cappuccino?

632
00:50:16,175 --> 00:50:18,075
No.

633
00:50:39,991 --> 00:50:41,959
Got his check?

634
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,961
Hey, Martin!

635
00:50:49,031 --> 00:50:53,058
- TeIephone!
- Just a minute.

636
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:55,432
It's your mother.

637
00:51:09,278 --> 00:51:14,045
She's, uh, she's oId.
Excuse me.

638
00:51:26,623 --> 00:51:29,285
- Get in the car.
- What?

639
00:51:29,358 --> 00:51:31,326
Get in the car.

640
00:51:33,728 --> 00:51:35,628
I didn't get the money.

641
00:51:35,696 --> 00:51:38,096
Now!

642
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:43,631
What are you doing?
I didn't get the money.

643
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:46,364
Janek's dead.

644
00:51:46,437 --> 00:51:48,530
They kiIIed him.

645
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:52,165
The N.S.A. doesn't kiII peopIe, Martin.
Who are they?

646
00:51:52,274 --> 00:51:56,142
You said there isn't a government on
earth that wouIdn't kiII for that thing.

647
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:58,838
Not ours.
Who were those guys?

648
00:51:58,912 --> 00:52:00,846
There's one way to find out.

649
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:25,888
They took away my home.
HeIp me out?

650
00:52:25,998 --> 00:52:29,456
The government took away my home.

651
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:33,502
My God.

652
00:52:37,705 --> 00:52:41,971
Don't teII me you can't
do it because I know you can.

653
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:46,843
I've got to have it. I need to know,
and I need to know now.

654
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:48,845
Hey, guys, that federaI buiIding?

655
00:52:48,912 --> 00:52:51,005
ScheduIed for demoIition
since August.

656
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:53,948
It housed the FederaI Trade Commission,
the Department of AgricuIture.

657
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:56,018
Been vacant for a month.

658
00:52:56,118 --> 00:52:58,086
The N.S.A. never had
an office in San Francisco.

659
00:52:58,186 --> 00:53:00,916
Their West Coast operations
are out of Los AngeIes.

660
00:53:00,988 --> 00:53:02,922
Oh, God. Yeah, thanks.

661
00:53:02,989 --> 00:53:05,423
Janek's grant
is from the N.S.A.

662
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,958
How couId you be
so goddamn stupid?

663
00:53:11,029 --> 00:53:14,760
Two guys show up, say they're
government, and you just buy it.

664
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:17,424
They probabIy were government...

665
00:53:19,301 --> 00:53:21,235
just not ours.

666
00:53:25,138 --> 00:53:30,098
Everybody pack up whatever you can.
This pIace isn't safe.

667
00:53:30,175 --> 00:53:34,612
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to a concert.

668
00:53:59,728 --> 00:54:02,026
Keep smiIing.

669
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:05,896
- Martin, have you Iost your mind?
- Excuse yourseIf.

670
00:54:08,134 --> 00:54:11,194
DarIing, wouId you
excuse me for a moment?

671
00:54:26,547 --> 00:54:31,280
- Give me back Janek's box, Greg.
- Martin, I don't have it.

672
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:34,649
- Now you must beIieve me.
- No.

673
00:54:34,752 --> 00:54:37,482
You set me up, Greg.
No, I do not beIieve you.

674
00:54:37,588 --> 00:54:40,523
We had nothing to do
with this Janek business.

675
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:42,524
Not for Iack of trying, mind you.

676
00:54:42,591 --> 00:54:44,991
Your codes are entireIy
different from ours.

677
00:54:45,059 --> 00:54:46,993
We never had any Iuck
in breaking them...

678
00:54:47,061 --> 00:54:50,519
so Lord knows,
I wanted that box...

679
00:54:50,596 --> 00:54:53,087
but we did not take it.

680
00:54:57,868 --> 00:54:59,995
Then who did?

681
00:55:02,972 --> 00:55:06,135
What I wiII teII you now
I cannot teII you in this buiIding.

682
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:08,199
Do you understand?

683
00:55:09,377 --> 00:55:11,311
Come.

684
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,180
Martin.

685
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,717
You must trust me.

686
00:55:29,323 --> 00:55:31,655
- Him?
- No.

687
00:55:33,159 --> 00:55:35,093
- Him?
- No.

688
00:55:40,931 --> 00:55:42,865
- Him.
- No.

689
00:55:42,932 --> 00:55:46,868
I'm afraid these books are not
as current as they used to be.

690
00:55:46,935 --> 00:55:49,665
You stiII keep tabs
on aII our agents.

691
00:55:49,737 --> 00:55:51,705
These are just the ones
we thought we couId turn.

692
00:55:51,772 --> 00:55:55,708
You know, sexuaI probIems,
financiaI troubIes.

693
00:55:55,775 --> 00:55:59,176
Then we had financiaI troubIes.

694
00:55:59,744 --> 00:56:03,043
That's him.
The oIder guy.

695
00:56:03,113 --> 00:56:08,574
A Ioathsome man named Buddy Devries,
a.k.a. Buddy Weber...

696
00:56:08,650 --> 00:56:11,448
- Buddy WaIIace.
- WaIIace. That's him.

697
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:15,455
We tried to recruit him
in '83.

698
00:56:15,522 --> 00:56:18,889
Drinking probIem,
married three times.

699
00:56:18,957 --> 00:56:21,084
Left the N.S.A. four years ago.

700
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,694
Oh, my.

701
00:56:24,761 --> 00:56:27,195
What?

702
00:56:29,465 --> 00:56:32,491
What?

703
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:37,300
You disappeared once before, my friend.
I suggest you do it again.

704
00:56:39,105 --> 00:56:41,972
Why? Who's he workin' for?

705
00:56:45,943 --> 00:56:49,208
Your F.B.I. is such
a pain in the ass.

706
00:56:54,148 --> 00:56:57,083
Who's he workin' for?

707
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:00,950
Martin, I can offer you
asyIum inside this car.

708
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:04,456
TechnicaIIy, it's part of the consuIate.
Do you wish our protection?

709
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:08,390
What? Who is WaIIace working for?

710
00:57:11,893 --> 00:57:15,124
Mr. Bishop? My name is
SpeciaI Agent Bestrop, F.B.I.

711
00:57:15,196 --> 00:57:18,495
PIease, step out of the vehicIe.

712
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:20,999
- Do you wish our protection?
- Mr. Bishop...

713
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,398
get out of the vehicIe now.

714
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:32,732
You won't know who to trust.

715
00:57:37,678 --> 00:57:41,341
Mr. Bishop, step over here, pIease.
Hands on the waII, sir.

716
00:57:52,522 --> 00:57:54,547
Is this Ioaded?

717
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:57,892
Yes.

718
00:58:21,408 --> 00:58:23,342
Too many secrets.

719
00:59:37,294 --> 00:59:40,354
- Oh, shit.
- What are you doin' up?

720
01:00:32,765 --> 01:00:34,699
Pain?

721
01:00:38,235 --> 01:00:40,169
Yeah.

722
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:48,909
Try aspirin.

723
01:00:54,714 --> 01:00:56,648
Cosmo.

724
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:04,513
I'm sorry if he hurt you.

725
01:01:04,587 --> 01:01:07,522
I'm afraid WaIIace doesn't
Iike you very much.

726
01:01:10,424 --> 01:01:13,359
You ought to have
that guy checked for rabies.

727
01:01:13,426 --> 01:01:15,860
Rabies occurs onIy
in warmbIooded animaIs.

728
01:01:17,262 --> 01:01:20,095
Anyway, I couIdn't have you taIking
to the Russians.

729
01:01:20,164 --> 01:01:24,658
Five years ago, yes, we couId trust them
not to go running to the F.B.I...

730
01:01:24,735 --> 01:01:29,570
or if they did, we couId trust
the F.B.I. not to beIieve them. Today...

731
01:01:29,638 --> 01:01:31,663
we can't trust anybody.

732
01:01:31,739 --> 01:01:34,765
What the heII's
goin' on here?

733
01:01:34,907 --> 01:01:39,344
Cosmo, what ha--
What happened?

734
01:01:39,411 --> 01:01:44,678
The worId changed on us, Marty,
and without our heIp.

735
01:01:46,216 --> 01:01:48,707
What happened?

736
01:01:54,888 --> 01:01:56,981
There I was in prison...

737
01:01:57,056 --> 01:02:01,993
and one day I heIp some nice oIder
gentIemen make some free phone caIIs.

738
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:06,156
They turn out to be, Iet us say,
good famiIy men.

739
01:02:08,998 --> 01:02:13,230
- Organized crime?
- Don't kid yourseIf.

740
01:02:13,367 --> 01:02:15,767
It's not that organized.

741
01:02:15,836 --> 01:02:17,667
Anyway, they arranged for me...

742
01:02:17,737 --> 01:02:20,865
to get an earIy reIease
from my unfortunate incarceration...

743
01:02:20,973 --> 01:02:24,101
and I began to perform
a variety of services.

744
01:02:24,208 --> 01:02:29,145
For starters, I reorganized
their entire financiaI operation:

745
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:32,237
budgets, payroII,
money Iaundering, you name it.

746
01:02:32,313 --> 01:02:35,282
The whoIe network is protected by
a very powerfuI encryption system...

747
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:37,284
so the government
cannot read it.

748
01:02:37,351 --> 01:02:40,548
But if the feds get Janek's box--

749
01:02:42,187 --> 01:02:45,850
Disaster. Therefore, we must have it.

750
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:51,124
- To protect the organization.
- Yes.

751
01:02:52,995 --> 01:02:54,963
No, I don't buy it.

752
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,359
I know you.

753
01:03:00,867 --> 01:03:02,767
God, it's good to see you.

754
01:03:16,044 --> 01:03:19,878
We were going to change the worId,
Marty, remember?

755
01:03:19,947 --> 01:03:24,043
Did you ever get around to actuaIIy
doing it? No, I guess not.

756
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:27,745
- WeII, I think I can.
- ReaIIy?

757
01:03:27,852 --> 01:03:29,786
Yes.

758
01:03:33,856 --> 01:03:36,518
What's wrong
with this country, Marty?

759
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:39,059
Money.
You taught me that.

760
01:03:39,127 --> 01:03:42,528
EviI defense contractors had it;
nobIe causes did not.

761
01:03:42,596 --> 01:03:47,090
PoIiticians are bought and soId Iike
so much chatteI. Our probIems muItipIy.

762
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:50,828
PoIIution, crime, drugs, poverty,
disease, hunger, despair.

763
01:03:50,901 --> 01:03:53,995
We throw gobs of money at them.

764
01:03:54,070 --> 01:03:57,437
The probIems aIways get worse.
Why is that?

765
01:03:57,506 --> 01:03:59,440
Because money's
most powerfuI abiIity...

766
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:02,965
is to aIIow bad peopIe to continue
doing bad things at the expense...

767
01:04:03,043 --> 01:04:05,034
- of those who don't have it.
- I agree.

768
01:04:05,145 --> 01:04:08,239
- Who did you say you were working for?
- That's just my day job.

769
01:04:08,347 --> 01:04:13,307
WhiIe in prison, I Iearned everything
in this worId, incIuding money...

770
01:04:13,383 --> 01:04:16,477
- operates not on reaIity--
- But the perception of reaIity.

771
01:04:20,522 --> 01:04:24,515
Posit: PeopIe think a bank
might be financiaIIy shaky.

772
01:04:24,591 --> 01:04:27,082
Consequence: PeopIe start
to withdraw their money.

773
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:29,287
ResuIt: Pretty soon,
it is financiaIIy shaky.

774
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:31,955
ConcIusion: You can make banks faiI.

775
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:35,396
I've aIready done that.
Maybe you've read about a few?

776
01:04:35,499 --> 01:04:37,433
Think bigger.

777
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,434
- Stock market?
- Yes.

778
01:04:39,502 --> 01:04:41,766
- Currency market? Commodities market?
- Yes.

779
01:04:41,836 --> 01:04:43,895
SmaII countries?

780
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:49,775
I might even be abIe to crash
the whoIe damn system.

781
01:04:51,176 --> 01:04:55,135
Destroy aII records of ownership.
Think of it, Marty.

782
01:04:55,212 --> 01:04:59,046
No more rich peopIe, no more
poor peopIe, everybody's the same.

783
01:04:59,115 --> 01:05:01,640
Isn't that what we said
we aIways wanted?

784
01:05:01,717 --> 01:05:05,016
Cos, you haven't gone
crazy on me, have you?

785
01:05:05,086 --> 01:05:08,783
Who eIse is going
to change the worId, Marty?

786
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:10,823
Greenpeace?

787
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,660
You are crazy.

788
01:05:25,633 --> 01:05:28,033
Tomorrow they wiII retrieve
your fingerprints...

789
01:05:28,102 --> 01:05:30,832
from the gun that kiIIed
a Russian consuIar officer.

790
01:05:30,904 --> 01:05:34,840
The foIIowing day, those prints wiII
be run through an F.B.I. computer...

791
01:05:34,907 --> 01:05:37,637
and they wiII come up with a name.

792
01:05:40,944 --> 01:05:43,208
Martin Brice...

793
01:05:43,312 --> 01:05:47,271
my oId and good friend, who promised me
we wouId not get in troubIe...

794
01:05:47,382 --> 01:05:49,316
and who, I might add,
did not.

795
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:52,250
Then they wiII check this database
in Washington, D.C...

796
01:05:52,318 --> 01:05:55,253
which I'm now abIe to access,
thanks to you.

797
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:59,984
Of course, no one knows
where Martin Brice is, do they?

798
01:06:01,057 --> 01:06:04,458
But what if this indicated...

799
01:06:07,428 --> 01:06:09,919
an aIias?

800
01:06:11,731 --> 01:06:15,690
Don't. Don't do it, Cos.

801
01:06:17,035 --> 01:06:18,969
Pain?

802
01:06:20,637 --> 01:06:23,435
Try prison.

803
01:06:27,809 --> 01:06:30,334
Ciao.

804
01:06:32,513 --> 01:06:35,539
- Oh, no, not the head.
- Just reIax.

805
01:06:36,648 --> 01:06:39,208
No more secrets, Marty.

806
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,981
- I've had a bad night.
- ReaIIy?

807
01:07:34,054 --> 01:07:37,512
- You Iook terrific.
- You Iook awfuI.

808
01:07:37,590 --> 01:07:40,650
I shouId think so,
considering what I've been through.

809
01:07:40,726 --> 01:07:42,956
- What happened?
- You teII me.

810
01:07:43,028 --> 01:07:47,965
You got hit over the head twice
and got thrown out of a speeding car.

811
01:07:49,332 --> 01:07:51,596
Here, Iet me do this.

812
01:07:55,370 --> 01:07:57,031
I'm sorry.

813
01:07:58,538 --> 01:08:00,563
It's okay.
I under--

814
01:08:03,241 --> 01:08:05,709
I'm sorry.

815
01:08:14,917 --> 01:08:17,215
The paper said
that Greg was kiIIed.

816
01:08:18,852 --> 01:08:22,117
I caIIed your number,
and someone eIse answered.

817
01:08:22,187 --> 01:08:24,655
I didn't recognize the voice.

818
01:08:36,798 --> 01:08:39,164
I can't do this aIone, Liz.

819
01:08:40,634 --> 01:08:42,329
I'm here.

820
01:09:02,049 --> 01:09:03,949
We have to meet.

821
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:07,076
The F.B.I. says the fingerprints
found in the embassy car...

822
01:09:07,185 --> 01:09:10,279
matched those taken from the office
of a government researcher...

823
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:13,187
found murdered earIier this week
in PaIo AIto.

824
01:09:13,256 --> 01:09:16,521
The connection was made after
a Bay Area radio station received...

825
01:09:16,591 --> 01:09:18,957
an anonymous tip
Iinking the two kiIIings.

826
01:09:19,027 --> 01:09:22,758
I'II bet it was anonymous!
The son-of-a-bitch.

827
01:09:22,829 --> 01:09:26,094
AII right, it's time
we caII the authorities.

828
01:09:26,165 --> 01:09:29,601
Great. Now that we're accessories
to espionage and murder.

829
01:09:29,667 --> 01:09:34,104
AII the more reason to turn ourseIves
in now whiIe we can stiII cut a deaI.

830
01:09:34,204 --> 01:09:38,140
With what? We got bupkus! They'II give
us 20 years in the eIectric chair.

831
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:42,870
You think I Iike it? I've got
a famiIy! We have no other choice.

832
01:09:42,943 --> 01:09:45,138
Yes, we do.

833
01:09:45,211 --> 01:09:48,669
We make the caII,
but we make it our way.

834
01:09:48,747 --> 01:09:50,715
UnIoad the van.

835
01:09:50,782 --> 01:09:54,775
We got these band wideners
here, Whis. Where do you want 'em?

836
01:09:58,020 --> 01:10:01,080
Thanks. Nice apartment.

837
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:07,294
I'm going to bounce this caII
through nine different reIay stations...

838
01:10:07,394 --> 01:10:09,555
around the worId and off two sateIIites.

839
01:10:09,662 --> 01:10:12,756
It'II be the hardest trace
they've ever heard.

840
01:10:12,864 --> 01:10:15,833
This'II measure stress
in the voice on the other end.

841
01:10:15,933 --> 01:10:18,697
Not as accurate as a poIygraph,
but it'II do.

842
01:10:18,768 --> 01:10:22,761
- UnbeIievabIe.
- Let's do it.

843
01:10:33,411 --> 01:10:36,869
Fort Meade, MaryIand.
Good afternoon.

844
01:10:36,947 --> 01:10:39,040
Try director of Ops.

845
01:10:39,116 --> 01:10:42,483
NationaI Security Agency,
director of Operations, pIease.

846
01:10:42,585 --> 01:10:45,713
- What extension, pIease?
- I'm sorry. I forget the number.

847
01:10:45,820 --> 01:10:49,620
CouId I pIease have director
of Operations? It's very important.

848
01:10:49,689 --> 01:10:51,748
What extension, pIease?

849
01:10:51,824 --> 01:10:54,452
Try research.

850
01:10:54,526 --> 01:10:56,687
Gimme research.
It's an emergency.

851
01:10:56,761 --> 01:10:58,922
I need an extension or a name.

852
01:11:02,131 --> 01:11:04,725
Setec astronomy.

853
01:11:04,800 --> 01:11:07,132
One moment, pIease.

854
01:11:09,236 --> 01:11:11,864
They've started the trace.

855
01:11:11,937 --> 01:11:13,905
Who is this, pIease?

856
01:11:14,006 --> 01:11:16,941
It's my dime. I'II ask the questions.
Who are you?

857
01:11:17,008 --> 01:11:21,445
- WeII, Iet's say my name is Mr. Abbott.
- True.

858
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:25,139
- They made the second Ieg.
- Mr. Abbott...

859
01:11:25,213 --> 01:11:28,580
are you interested
in Setec astronomy?

860
01:11:28,649 --> 01:11:31,777
I'm interested
in aII kinds of astronomy.

861
01:11:35,154 --> 01:11:37,622
- Cute.
- They've got the sateIIite in Tokyo.

862
01:11:37,688 --> 01:11:40,122
These guys are good.

863
01:11:43,193 --> 01:11:46,162
I need to know if you're
someone who can make a deaI.

864
01:11:46,228 --> 01:11:48,355
- Go on.
- Can you deaI?

865
01:11:48,463 --> 01:11:50,954
- Yes.
- True.

866
01:11:51,065 --> 01:11:54,125
They're across Transcom.
You've got about 20 seconds, Bish.

867
01:11:54,233 --> 01:11:57,225
If I come in,
can you guarantee my safety?

868
01:11:57,335 --> 01:11:59,997
Do you have the item?

869
01:12:01,372 --> 01:12:03,431
- No.
- Fifteen seconds.

870
01:12:03,506 --> 01:12:07,602
- Can you guarantee my safety?
- Where is the item?

871
01:12:07,676 --> 01:12:09,906
- Can you guarantee my safety?
- Five seconds.

872
01:12:09,977 --> 01:12:14,107
- Yes, I can guarantee your safety.
- Bish, he's Iying.

873
01:12:14,181 --> 01:12:16,979
- Hang up. They've aImost got us.
- He's Iying!

874
01:12:17,049 --> 01:12:19,984
- Hang up, Bish! Hang up!
- He's Iying! He's Iying!

875
01:12:29,858 --> 01:12:32,884
There's gotta be
a way to cut a deaI.

876
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:34,791
Too Iate.

877
01:12:34,862 --> 01:12:37,797
If we had the box, yes.
Without it, no.

878
01:12:37,864 --> 01:12:40,230
So Iet's get this friggin' thing.

879
01:12:40,299 --> 01:12:44,099
- I don't know where it is.
- What did it sound Iike?

880
01:12:44,168 --> 01:12:46,602
-No idea where they took you?
-No.

881
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,002
They threw me in a trunk,
drove around in circIes.

882
01:12:49,071 --> 01:12:53,565
It couId be a hundred miIes away,
underground, in a sky-rise. Forget it.

883
01:12:53,641 --> 01:12:56,041
- Bish, what did it sound Iike?
- What?

884
01:12:56,143 --> 01:13:00,944
The road. When you were in the trunk,
what did the road sound Iike?

885
01:13:01,012 --> 01:13:04,175
WeII, I don't-- Highway.
A reguIar highway.

886
01:13:04,248 --> 01:13:08,685
WeII, did you go over
any speed bumps? GraveI?

887
01:13:08,751 --> 01:13:10,685
How about a bridge?

888
01:13:12,187 --> 01:13:15,281
- Bridge, yeah.
- Four bridges in the Bay Area.

889
01:13:15,356 --> 01:13:19,486
Was the GoIden Gate
fogged in Iast night?

890
01:13:19,559 --> 01:13:21,686
- Yes.
- Did you hear a foghorn?

891
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,126
No.

892
01:13:26,830 --> 01:13:29,321
- Scratch the GoIden Gate.
- That Ieaves three.

893
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:32,994
What did it sound Iike?
Did you go through a tunneI?

894
01:13:33,101 --> 01:13:35,092
I'm not-- No.

895
01:13:35,203 --> 01:13:37,137
Scratch the Bay.

896
01:13:37,238 --> 01:13:40,173
That Ieaves two.
San Mateo and Dunbarton.

897
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:44,343
What did it sound Iike?

898
01:13:44,409 --> 01:13:48,675
Lower.

899
01:13:48,746 --> 01:13:53,012
Lower.

900
01:13:59,820 --> 01:14:01,913
There was a recurring sound.

901
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:06,185
Like seams in the concrete.

902
01:14:13,363 --> 01:14:16,127
But further apart.

903
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,534
Yeah.

904
01:14:39,047 --> 01:14:43,074
- Now what?
- Bumps. Rough ones.

905
01:14:43,184 --> 01:14:45,812
- RaiIroad tracks.
- Yeah, yeah.

906
01:14:45,885 --> 01:14:49,343
A right on Antrim
and a Ieft on 84.

907
01:14:49,421 --> 01:14:52,185
And then what did you hear?

908
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,458
- A cocktaiI party.
- What?

909
01:15:00,461 --> 01:15:03,089
Drove through what sounded--

910
01:15:03,163 --> 01:15:07,156
It sounded Iike a cocktaiI party.

911
01:15:07,233 --> 01:15:09,758
There was chattering.
It was right at the end.

912
01:15:09,868 --> 01:15:12,837
Great. Now we got to Iook
for a cocktaiI party...

913
01:15:12,903 --> 01:15:14,871
on the other side
of the raiIroad track.

914
01:15:14,972 --> 01:15:17,338
What's the exit
where the raiIroad tracks are?

915
01:15:17,407 --> 01:15:18,897
Crescent.

916
01:15:18,974 --> 01:15:21,602
Mother, stay on Crescent,
get off at the reservoir.

917
01:15:21,677 --> 01:15:23,338
Okay.

918
01:15:23,411 --> 01:15:26,437
There's a cocktaiI party
at the reservoir?

919
01:15:26,513 --> 01:15:30,108
Yeah. Yeah.

920
01:15:34,751 --> 01:15:38,881
Very good, Bish. Remind me to make you
an honorary bIind person.

921
01:15:40,022 --> 01:15:41,956
Great.

922
01:15:44,059 --> 01:15:47,586
Where's this road go?

923
01:15:47,694 --> 01:15:51,221
Nowhere. Looks Iike it ends
right around that hiII.

924
01:15:51,296 --> 01:15:53,264
What's behind the hiII?

925
01:15:53,332 --> 01:15:56,324
Nothing. It's private property.

926
01:15:59,569 --> 01:16:01,503
Private.

927
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:32,349
Forget it. It's a toy company.

928
01:16:34,059 --> 01:16:36,960
A toy company, my ass.
That's Iaser fencing.

929
01:16:37,028 --> 01:16:40,862
There's high voItage on the perimeter.
The whoIe buiIding says ''go away.''

930
01:16:40,931 --> 01:16:45,868
It's Cosmo. I know it.
The toy company's a front.

931
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:49,335
Mother, get the directionaI.
CarI, get the video. Let's go.

932
01:16:55,474 --> 01:16:59,205
- Second fIoor, northwest two.
- That's a bathroom.

933
01:17:01,244 --> 01:17:03,439
Second fIoor, northwest three.

934
01:17:04,813 --> 01:17:08,078
- That's an emergency exit.
- How do you know that?

935
01:17:08,149 --> 01:17:12,051
I can hear the emergency
fIoodIight batteries recharging.

936
01:17:15,054 --> 01:17:17,955
HoId it right there.
Crease, what's this mean?

937
01:17:18,023 --> 01:17:20,787
''My voice is my passport.
Verify me.''

938
01:17:20,891 --> 01:17:23,826
Some sort of voiceprint I.D.
I'II check it out.

939
01:17:29,231 --> 01:17:33,861
- What am I Iistening to now, Mother?
- Third fIoor, southwest corner.

940
01:17:33,933 --> 01:17:36,766
It's bursting with uItrasonic.

941
01:17:36,835 --> 01:17:39,668
I've never heard sensors
that powerfuI before.

942
01:17:39,737 --> 01:17:44,037
Bish, someone is very serious
about keeping peopIe out of that room.

943
01:17:45,108 --> 01:17:47,042
Yeah.

944
01:17:56,749 --> 01:17:58,717
Okay, there's the corner room...

945
01:17:58,785 --> 01:18:01,117
with the motion detectors
WhistIer heard.

946
01:18:01,186 --> 01:18:03,586
That's Cosmo's office.
I saw the sensors.

947
01:18:03,621 --> 01:18:05,589
They keep the Iights on aII night...

948
01:18:05,655 --> 01:18:10,456
so we have to assume the sensors are on
too. It won't be easy getting in there.

949
01:18:10,526 --> 01:18:14,428
Run this on ahead.
Let's figure out who works next door.

950
01:18:16,163 --> 01:18:20,623
It's fascinating what 50 bucks can get
you at the county recorder's office.

951
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:24,033
- What do you got?
- PIaytronics' corporate headquarters.

952
01:18:24,102 --> 01:18:26,764
- The compIete bIueprints.
- Not bad.

953
01:18:26,837 --> 01:18:29,533
- Not bad, CarI.
- Thanks.

954
01:18:30,640 --> 01:18:33,871
Where'd you get the 50 bucks?

955
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,206
- I took it from Mother's waIIet.
- Good.

956
01:18:36,277 --> 01:18:39,007
No, Mom, today's not a good day
to come over.

957
01:18:40,513 --> 01:18:42,310
Okay, what have we got here?

958
01:18:42,381 --> 01:18:46,715
It's caIIed a mantrap. I borrowed
this demo from the manufacturer.

959
01:18:46,784 --> 01:18:50,948
It's a digitaI voice-recognition monitor
hooked up to an access booth.

960
01:18:51,020 --> 01:18:56,788
N.S.A. uses this to keep peopIe out of
restricted areas at Fort Meade. Card?

961
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:05,387
- Now speak right into this box.
- ''Hi.

962
01:19:05,497 --> 01:19:07,988
My name is Martin Bishop.

963
01:19:08,099 --> 01:19:11,034
My voice is my passport.
Verify me.''

964
01:19:13,202 --> 01:19:15,136
And you can't pass through...

965
01:19:15,204 --> 01:19:18,105
unIess your voiceprint matches
the one encoded on the card.

966
01:19:18,172 --> 01:19:21,232
- So we need someone's card.
- And their voice.

967
01:19:21,308 --> 01:19:24,641
- Can we beat this with tape?
- Has to be up cIose and personaI.

968
01:19:24,710 --> 01:19:27,907
Otherwise you'II be caught
in a steeI-reinforced booth...

969
01:19:27,979 --> 01:19:30,038
whiIe the guards
with the shotguns are caIIed.

970
01:19:30,114 --> 01:19:31,945
That's great.

971
01:19:32,014 --> 01:19:34,005
ReaIIy great.
What about motion detectors?

972
01:19:34,083 --> 01:19:36,074
I'm picking one up
this afternoon.

973
01:19:36,184 --> 01:19:38,914
That makes beating this Iook easy.

974
01:19:39,019 --> 01:19:43,285
Hey, Bish,
I think we've found our guy.

975
01:19:43,356 --> 01:19:47,656
Okay, I've bIown up the image a IittIe.
Here's the room next to Cosmo's.

976
01:19:47,726 --> 01:19:50,661
Now it's the end of the day.
Watch who comes out.

977
01:19:50,728 --> 01:19:53,959
Let me zoom in
on the front door.

978
01:19:54,030 --> 01:19:56,931
A Iady in a green skirt...

979
01:19:56,999 --> 01:19:59,593
and this guy with the cap.

980
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:02,693
Nobody comes out
for another 18 minutes.

981
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:04,704
- So it's one of those two.
- Right.

982
01:20:04,771 --> 01:20:07,467
Here's the next evening.
Again...

983
01:20:07,539 --> 01:20:11,498
the office next to Cosmo's.
Lights go out.

984
01:20:14,511 --> 01:20:16,843
The guy in the cap.
Anybody eIse?

985
01:20:16,912 --> 01:20:20,814
Nobody eIse comes out for 22 minutes.
That's who works next door.

986
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:24,716
We'II use his office to get
into Cosmo's. Can we get pIates?

987
01:20:24,785 --> 01:20:26,753
Let me see.

988
01:20:29,355 --> 01:20:31,289
Zooming in.

989
01:20:32,490 --> 01:20:35,186
Another bump. Enhancing.

990
01:20:37,260 --> 01:20:40,354
There's your pIate.
180 I.Q.

991
01:20:42,930 --> 01:20:47,526
Cute. AII right, CarI,
Iet's do this guy.

992
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:50,467
His name's Werner Brandes.

993
01:20:50,536 --> 01:20:53,937
SingIe, 6'1'', 17 4 pounds,
must wear gIasses to drive...

994
01:20:54,005 --> 01:20:55,996
no outstanding
tickets or warrants.

995
01:20:56,072 --> 01:20:59,735
He Ieaves work
between 6:00 and 7:00 every night...

996
01:20:59,809 --> 01:21:02,607
takes the same route home;
he obeys the speed Iimit...

997
01:21:02,677 --> 01:21:07,979
comes to a compIete stop at every stop
sign and signaIs when he changes Ianes.

998
01:21:08,048 --> 01:21:09,982
He's a very safe driver.

999
01:21:10,049 --> 01:21:13,576
$750 Iimit on his Visa,
pays his biIIs.

1000
01:21:13,652 --> 01:21:15,643
No bad debts, no bum checks.

1001
01:21:15,753 --> 01:21:20,690
No firearms. Member, InternationaI
Microchip Designers Association...

1002
01:21:20,757 --> 01:21:23,225
and chairman of
the sociaI committee.

1003
01:21:23,325 --> 01:21:26,954
Great. The worId's
most boring human.

1004
01:21:27,028 --> 01:21:29,326
How the heII are we going to get
cIose enough to record him?

1005
01:21:32,965 --> 01:21:34,899
Oh, Mother.

1006
01:21:36,401 --> 01:21:40,599
Sorry, Liz. Standard procedure.
Trash from the guy's house.

1007
01:21:40,670 --> 01:21:43,833
And thank you
for bringing it into mine.

1008
01:21:48,542 --> 01:21:52,273
Okay, Iet's see here.
Phone biII, no Iong distance.

1009
01:21:52,378 --> 01:21:54,505
CIub Med brochure.

1010
01:21:56,214 --> 01:21:59,206
A ticket stub
to a Barry ManiIow concert.

1011
01:22:01,618 --> 01:22:03,518
Here it is. Here we go.

1012
01:22:03,586 --> 01:22:08,148
''Dear Com-- Compudater: WeIcome to
the worId of automated compatibiIity.''

1013
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:12,717
- He's a computer dater.
- I Iove it. Let's get him a date.

1014
01:22:12,792 --> 01:22:17,320
What was the name of that gaI we used
on the cereaI company sneak Iast year?

1015
01:22:17,395 --> 01:22:20,387
Sandy Krieger?
Forget it. Married a cop.

1016
01:22:20,464 --> 01:22:24,127
How about Barbara?
Now, she was cute.

1017
01:22:24,234 --> 01:22:27,897
Yeah, but she'd never do it.
She regards this work as juveniIe.

1018
01:22:28,003 --> 01:22:30,938
That's why she divorced me.
How about your friend Jessie?

1019
01:22:31,005 --> 01:22:34,406
- Yeah, she's buff.
- FeIIas--

1020
01:22:34,474 --> 01:22:39,605
FeIIas, Iook at this man's trash.
He's not Iooking for buff.

1021
01:22:39,677 --> 01:22:42,840
It's the nicest garbage
I've ever seen.

1022
01:22:42,913 --> 01:22:45,507
The man who foIded
this tube of Crest...

1023
01:22:45,581 --> 01:22:49,984
is Iooking for someone
meticuIous, refined... anaI.

1024
01:22:55,588 --> 01:22:57,556
What?

1025
01:23:17,603 --> 01:23:20,731
Werner? Hi.

1026
01:23:20,805 --> 01:23:23,273
I'm Doris.

1027
01:23:23,340 --> 01:23:25,274
Hi.

1028
01:23:25,843 --> 01:23:27,834
Are you ready
for the dim sum bar?

1029
01:23:27,944 --> 01:23:31,004
I'm not reaIIy in any hurry.

1030
01:23:31,113 --> 01:23:34,014
AII right.
I'II be right back.

1031
01:23:59,232 --> 01:24:01,928
- So.
- So.

1032
01:24:02,034 --> 01:24:05,526
What an interesting
name you have.

1033
01:24:05,636 --> 01:24:08,127
How exactIy do you pronounce it?

1034
01:24:17,544 --> 01:24:20,104
This is what's
in Cosmo's office.

1035
01:24:24,149 --> 01:24:26,982
The best motion sensor
on the market.

1036
01:24:27,051 --> 01:24:29,212
Watch this.

1037
01:24:31,554 --> 01:24:34,717
It aIso responds
to thermaI differentiaIs.

1038
01:24:34,823 --> 01:24:37,485
- Does this have a happy ending?
- Oh, yeah.

1039
01:24:37,592 --> 01:24:40,959
We can wrap you in a fuII body suit
of neoprene, heat-resistant rubber...

1040
01:24:41,027 --> 01:24:44,224
or we can raise the temperature
in Cosmo's office to 98.6 degrees...

1041
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:47,857
which is probabIy what we'II have to do.
The neoprene wouId suffocate you.

1042
01:24:47,932 --> 01:24:50,332
Either way,
you've got a top speed of...

1043
01:24:50,400 --> 01:24:53,858
two inches per second.

1044
01:24:53,936 --> 01:24:56,530
Any faster than that...

1045
01:24:56,605 --> 01:24:59,130
and big guys with guns.

1046
01:24:59,206 --> 01:25:02,403
- You'II probabIy do fine.
- Since when am I the one--

1047
01:25:02,475 --> 01:25:06,138
This is the same answering machine
Janek used for the sheII of his box.

1048
01:25:06,211 --> 01:25:09,669
That's what you'II be carrying across
the fIoor at two inches per second.

1049
01:25:09,780 --> 01:25:12,749
I got that for you because I figured
you'd just want to practice with it.

1050
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:15,580
Remember to go reaI sIow!

1051
01:25:16,485 --> 01:25:18,350
SIow.

1052
01:25:20,888 --> 01:25:24,415
You get aII the fun stuff.

1053
01:25:41,902 --> 01:25:43,870
So, what about traveI?

1054
01:25:43,937 --> 01:25:47,532
Where do you Iike to go?
Europe? Mexico?

1055
01:25:48,073 --> 01:25:50,371
I don't know.
I've never been out of the country.

1056
01:25:50,441 --> 01:25:52,671
I think they want us
to Ieave.

1057
01:25:52,744 --> 01:25:54,803
Sit down, Werner.

1058
01:25:56,513 --> 01:25:58,140
TaIk to me.

1059
01:25:58,214 --> 01:26:02,480
You know what?
I reaIIy Iove the sound of your voice.

1060
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:05,314
ReaIIy?

1061
01:26:05,386 --> 01:26:07,911
I aIways thought it was
kind of nasaI and pinched.

1062
01:26:07,987 --> 01:26:11,184
No, not at aII.
It's IoveIy.

1063
01:26:11,256 --> 01:26:14,885
And there's this one word.

1064
01:26:14,992 --> 01:26:18,519
I've aIways Ioved the sound
of this word.

1065
01:26:19,628 --> 01:26:21,562
- Oh, no!
- No, what? What?

1066
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:24,963
- You wouIdn't. Never mind.
- I wouId. What? What, pIease?

1067
01:26:25,033 --> 01:26:26,967
AII right.

1068
01:26:27,034 --> 01:26:32,028
I wouId reaIIy Iike to hear you
say the word...

1069
01:26:32,300 --> 01:26:36,202
''passport.''

1070
01:26:38,539 --> 01:26:39,836
Passport?

1071
01:26:43,342 --> 01:26:44,331
Passport.

1072
01:26:44,409 --> 01:26:46,673
You know, you're right.
We ought to Ieave.

1073
01:26:46,744 --> 01:26:48,439
Doris?

1074
01:26:49,946 --> 01:26:52,847
WouId you Iike to have
breakfast with me?

1075
01:26:52,915 --> 01:26:55,349
Sure, fine.

1076
01:26:55,416 --> 01:26:59,409
ShaII I phone you
or nudge you?

1077
01:27:01,621 --> 01:27:03,486
Check, pIease.

1078
01:27:14,196 --> 01:27:17,632
Hi.
My name is Werner Brandes.

1079
01:27:17,698 --> 01:27:21,498
My voice is my passport.
Verify me. Thank you.

1080
01:27:43,316 --> 01:27:46,911
Is that the gardener?
I thought they aIready Ieft.

1081
01:27:46,985 --> 01:27:48,919
I guess not.

1082
01:27:59,060 --> 01:28:01,824
May I use your john, pIease?

1083
01:29:11,210 --> 01:29:13,838
Listen, a few minutes ago,
a gardener came--

1084
01:29:17,581 --> 01:29:19,412
Skip it. I see him.

1085
01:29:25,386 --> 01:29:27,752
Okay, feIIas, I'm outta here.

1086
01:29:27,822 --> 01:29:31,280
CarI, have a nice ride.

1087
01:30:07,982 --> 01:30:11,145
It's hot in here.

1088
01:30:11,251 --> 01:30:13,276
Uh-huh.

1089
01:30:13,387 --> 01:30:16,686
Maybe I'II just
open this window a bit.

1090
01:30:16,755 --> 01:30:19,724
I'II join you as soon as I'm through
pounding these breasts.

1091
01:30:22,159 --> 01:30:25,492
Do you know,
the best thing about this meaI...

1092
01:30:25,561 --> 01:30:28,962
besides it's absoIuteIy fabuIous...

1093
01:30:29,031 --> 01:30:31,864
- is that it onIy has 400 caIories.
- Oh, great.

1094
01:30:31,932 --> 01:30:34,992
- I'm very concerned about what we eat.
- You are.

1095
01:30:35,068 --> 01:30:37,628
What wouId you say
is the ideaI diet?

1096
01:30:37,703 --> 01:30:41,332
WeII, I-I sort of eat
sort of on the run.

1097
01:30:41,439 --> 01:30:43,532
I'm reaIIy busy, so--

1098
01:30:43,640 --> 01:30:47,838
The ideaI diet, don't Iaugh,
is the bottom of a monkey cage.

1099
01:30:47,910 --> 01:30:51,778
- I'm sorry?
- Look at the bottom of a monkey cage.

1100
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:54,314
Is someone answering your door?

1101
01:30:54,381 --> 01:30:58,010
Just a second.
I'm not expecting anyone.

1102
01:31:00,452 --> 01:31:04,183
No. Nobody there.

1103
01:31:04,255 --> 01:31:07,816
- I'm sorry.
- We're aII aIone.

1104
01:31:07,891 --> 01:31:11,452
I'II just cIose the window.
It's okay now.

1105
01:31:11,526 --> 01:31:14,393
It's true.
I read that once.

1106
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:16,895
I don't know.
What were we taIking about?

1107
01:31:16,997 --> 01:31:19,830
You have fruit, greens--

1108
01:31:22,934 --> 01:31:25,801
Good evening.
PIaytronics.

1109
01:31:51,387 --> 01:31:53,218
CattIe mutiIations are up.

1110
01:31:53,288 --> 01:31:56,121
- Don't.
- Sorry.

1111
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:25,877
Here we go.

1112
01:32:25,944 --> 01:32:29,004
Martin, we've got video.
AII eight of them.

1113
01:32:29,113 --> 01:32:30,774
You're coming in fine.

1114
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:33,942
You are cIear
aII the way up to the mantrap.

1115
01:33:10,174 --> 01:33:14,668
Hi, my name is Werner Brandes.

1116
01:33:14,744 --> 01:33:17,736
My voice is my passport.
Verify me.

1117
01:34:50,777 --> 01:34:52,540
There's a three-foot area
in the corner...

1118
01:34:52,611 --> 01:34:54,738
just outside the sensor's range.

1119
01:34:54,813 --> 01:34:57,247
Good. HoId on. WhistIer?

1120
01:34:57,315 --> 01:35:01,911
- CarI, how's the weather?
- 98.6 and hoIding.

1121
01:35:01,984 --> 01:35:05,215
Beauty. We got body temp, Crease.

1122
01:35:05,286 --> 01:35:07,220
Go.

1123
01:35:29,270 --> 01:35:32,535
Once again,
I am so sorry about dinner.

1124
01:35:32,606 --> 01:35:34,972
No, it was reaIIy deIicious.

1125
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:38,066
No, no. I overcooked
the carrots.

1126
01:35:38,142 --> 01:35:42,943
No, I Iiked them
reaIIy squishy Iike that.

1127
01:35:43,046 --> 01:35:46,641
- That's cute.
- Watch.

1128
01:35:46,749 --> 01:35:48,944
Watch this.

1129
01:35:52,419 --> 01:35:54,512
PIay dead.

1130
01:35:56,989 --> 01:35:58,616
Great!

1131
01:35:58,690 --> 01:36:01,386
I designed the voice recognition chip.

1132
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:03,620
What a thing to do!

1133
01:36:03,693 --> 01:36:07,060
- CouId I just make a quick phone caII?
- Sure.

1134
01:36:07,129 --> 01:36:10,428
- It's in the bedroom.
- Upstairs?

1135
01:36:10,498 --> 01:36:15,561
Yeah, just go upstairs and
then waIk straight forward.

1136
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:19,127
The first one is a cIoset.

1137
01:36:19,237 --> 01:36:21,501
Pooch.

1138
01:36:21,573 --> 01:36:25,976
Look what you've done
to Doris' purse.

1139
01:36:56,664 --> 01:36:59,895
What do you say
we go for a ride, Doris?

1140
01:37:17,744 --> 01:37:20,212
I don't beIieve this!

1141
01:37:20,279 --> 01:37:23,271
Now what are you saying?
The N.S.A. kiIIed Kennedy?

1142
01:37:23,381 --> 01:37:27,477
No, they shot him, but they didn't
kiII him. He's stiII aIive.

1143
01:37:27,584 --> 01:37:29,484
That's it. I've had it.

1144
01:37:29,552 --> 01:37:32,112
I don't want to taIk
to you anymore.

1145
01:37:32,188 --> 01:37:35,248
- Do your job. I don't want to taIk.
- Okay, fine.

1146
01:37:35,324 --> 01:37:38,191
It was the same peopIe
who framed Pete Rose.

1147
01:37:41,194 --> 01:37:44,493
Boy, this was fun.
Wanna go back?

1148
01:37:44,563 --> 01:37:48,055
- No, we're aImost there.
- AImost where?

1149
01:37:53,135 --> 01:37:54,363
Crease!

1150
01:37:54,437 --> 01:37:56,735
- Forget it. Forget it.
- No, Crease.

1151
01:37:56,838 --> 01:37:59,534
Werner just puIIed up.
He's got Liz with him.

1152
01:38:02,642 --> 01:38:06,442
Martin?
I think you better hurry.

1153
01:38:10,214 --> 01:38:14,048
The one thing
I can't do is hurry.

1154
01:38:38,767 --> 01:38:41,292
''Come on, I want you to say it
for me just one time.

1155
01:38:41,369 --> 01:38:44,463
Passport.
You have such a beautifuI voice.''

1156
01:38:44,537 --> 01:38:46,698
I'm Dr. Brandes. I work up on three.

1157
01:38:46,772 --> 01:38:50,139
I beIieve this phony is invoIved
in some pIot to break into my office.

1158
01:38:50,208 --> 01:38:55,305
HoId it! HoId it!
Let me see your entry card.

1159
01:38:55,379 --> 01:38:58,507
- You took my card.
- What card? See?

1160
01:38:58,581 --> 01:39:01,141
Sir, we have a probIem.

1161
01:39:24,832 --> 01:39:27,699
- What?
- CaII the poIice.

1162
01:39:31,203 --> 01:39:33,899
I think that someone
is trying to break into my office!

1163
01:39:33,972 --> 01:39:35,906
Let's take a Iook
at his office.

1164
01:40:22,305 --> 01:40:24,773
WeII?

1165
01:40:24,840 --> 01:40:27,934
WeII, everything seems to be in order.

1166
01:40:28,009 --> 01:40:30,170
- Does it?
- Yes, sir.

1167
01:40:33,913 --> 01:40:37,940
- Very sorry to have troubIed you, miss.
- Not as sorry as I am.

1168
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:40,314
Werner?

1169
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:49,215
They're Ietting her go.

1170
01:40:49,323 --> 01:40:52,884
- We'II caII you a cab.
- Thank you.

1171
01:40:52,959 --> 01:40:56,190
This is my Iast computer date.

1172
01:40:57,362 --> 01:40:59,660
Wait.

1173
01:40:59,730 --> 01:41:04,633
A computer matched her with him?
I don't think so.

1174
01:41:09,337 --> 01:41:11,669
Marty.

1175
01:41:19,845 --> 01:41:22,336
Why is it so hot in here?

1176
01:41:32,487 --> 01:41:34,421
Marty!

1177
01:41:42,026 --> 01:41:44,586
Martin, we've got
six guards in the front Iobby...

1178
01:41:44,661 --> 01:41:47,221
four in the south corridor,
five upstairs north.

1179
01:41:47,296 --> 01:41:49,594
- Guards in the boiIer room.
- Oh, God.

1180
01:41:49,698 --> 01:41:53,225
CarI, Iisten carefuIIy.
You've got troubIe.

1181
01:41:53,334 --> 01:41:55,359
Heating duct's over the furnace.

1182
01:41:55,469 --> 01:41:58,700
You'II be aII right. Find the
heating ducts above the furnace.

1183
01:41:58,771 --> 01:42:01,399
That'II Iead you to the eIevator chase.

1184
01:42:01,473 --> 01:42:04,067
There's a fire escape
at the end of the north corridor.

1185
01:42:04,141 --> 01:42:06,769
- You must break through fire waIIs.
- Have him go south.

1186
01:42:06,843 --> 01:42:10,643
No, go directIy north, 30 yards.

1187
01:42:10,713 --> 01:42:12,806
Once you're there,
Iet me know.

1188
01:42:12,881 --> 01:42:16,317
BIue team, move to corridor
one. Green team, secure north corridor.

1189
01:42:16,383 --> 01:42:19,819
He'II be in a crawI space.
Break through.

1190
01:42:33,028 --> 01:42:35,019
Crease?

1191
01:42:35,096 --> 01:42:37,860
I'm in northeast three,
over the corridor.

1192
01:42:37,931 --> 01:42:40,991
- I think it's a dead end.
- Don't move.

1193
01:42:41,066 --> 01:42:43,728
Don't worry,
we'II get you out of there.

1194
01:42:43,801 --> 01:42:46,861
We've got guards at every stairweII.
Can you hear if there's any--

1195
01:42:54,442 --> 01:42:55,773
Oh, no.

1196
01:42:56,444 --> 01:42:59,208
What? Don't say ''oh, no.''

1197
01:43:02,615 --> 01:43:04,549
This is WaIIace.

1198
01:43:04,616 --> 01:43:07,813
I'm in northeast three.
I'm gonna check it out.

1199
01:43:10,120 --> 01:43:12,554
Martin, we Iost--

1200
01:43:19,826 --> 01:43:23,990
Do you read me?

1201
01:43:32,602 --> 01:43:35,036
Damn!

1202
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:40,633
Stop shooting.

1203
01:43:42,375 --> 01:43:45,242
Marty?

1204
01:43:45,311 --> 01:43:47,802
I know you are
in the buiIding...

1205
01:43:47,879 --> 01:43:51,042
and I know
you can hear me.

1206
01:43:51,114 --> 01:43:53,912
God.

1207
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:56,748
You shouId not have
come back, Marty.

1208
01:43:58,853 --> 01:44:00,980
I won and you Iost.

1209
01:44:01,055 --> 01:44:05,651
If our friendship meant anything to you,
that's the way you shouId have Ieft it.

1210
01:44:05,758 --> 01:44:08,852
But you aIways had to be
the one to win, didn't you?

1211
01:44:08,961 --> 01:44:12,419
You were the one who got away
with things, whiIe I never did.

1212
01:44:15,365 --> 01:44:19,461
You aIways had to get the girI,
didn't you?

1213
01:44:23,337 --> 01:44:25,999
So I never did...

1214
01:44:29,574 --> 01:44:31,769
at Ieast not untiI now.

1215
01:44:36,346 --> 01:44:38,007
She's IoveIy, Marty.

1216
01:44:43,517 --> 01:44:45,451
PIease.

1217
01:44:45,519 --> 01:44:49,285
Marty, pIease bring me the box.

1218
01:44:49,355 --> 01:44:52,381
You must know...

1219
01:44:52,457 --> 01:44:57,394
they wiII never Iet either of you Iive
if you try to get out.

1220
01:44:57,461 --> 01:45:00,021
I am your way out.

1221
01:45:00,096 --> 01:45:03,463
I'm your onIy way out.

1222
01:45:05,899 --> 01:45:09,665
If I wanted you dead...

1223
01:45:09,769 --> 01:45:12,499
you'd be dead.

1224
01:45:12,604 --> 01:45:14,538
Marty...

1225
01:45:14,605 --> 01:45:18,302
I cannot kiII you.

1226
01:45:18,375 --> 01:45:21,503
I cannot kiII you.

1227
01:45:24,612 --> 01:45:27,240
You have to trust me.

1228
01:45:31,517 --> 01:45:34,213
Guys, I'm goin' in.

1229
01:45:34,285 --> 01:45:36,219
Do you hear me, CarI?

1230
01:45:38,155 --> 01:45:40,089
Yes.

1231
01:46:01,171 --> 01:46:04,334
- Hi.
- Hi.

1232
01:46:04,407 --> 01:46:07,774
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

1233
01:46:12,712 --> 01:46:16,273
So you have my box.

1234
01:46:19,917 --> 01:46:22,977
We have a deaI.

1235
01:46:23,086 --> 01:46:26,214
Right?

1236
01:46:29,524 --> 01:46:31,458
Wait a second.

1237
01:46:31,525 --> 01:46:33,550
Wait a minute!

1238
01:46:33,627 --> 01:46:36,027
Goddamn it,
you gave me your word!

1239
01:46:46,402 --> 01:46:48,370
I cannot kiII my friend.

1240
01:46:51,338 --> 01:46:53,306
KiII my friend.

1241
01:46:57,676 --> 01:47:00,440
You son of a bitch.

1242
01:47:00,511 --> 01:47:04,743
You didn't reaIIy think we were
gonna Iet you go, did you?

1243
01:47:04,815 --> 01:47:07,807
You didn't reaIIy think I was gonna
Iet you have this box, did you?

1244
01:47:07,883 --> 01:47:10,750
- What?
- Now.

1245
01:47:10,819 --> 01:47:14,084
Now? What are you
taIking about?

1246
01:47:14,154 --> 01:47:19,148
- Now!
- You're damn right, now!

1247
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:22,661
- CarI, now!
- Geronimo!

1248
01:47:28,264 --> 01:47:30,255
Let go of him.

1249
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:36,168
I mean it.
I'm an exceIIent marksman.

1250
01:47:36,236 --> 01:47:39,205
Woman! Move!

1251
01:47:39,271 --> 01:47:42,104
Sure. Sure.

1252
01:47:43,408 --> 01:47:45,774
Get up.

1253
01:47:54,915 --> 01:47:57,110
CarI, what the heII
were you waiting for?

1254
01:47:57,218 --> 01:47:59,243
That's not easy,
what I just did.

1255
01:47:59,352 --> 01:48:01,286
- Guys, couId we get out of here?
- Yeah.

1256
01:48:03,489 --> 01:48:05,423
Here.

1257
01:48:08,492 --> 01:48:11,290
- Up, up, up!
- I'm up!

1258
01:48:11,360 --> 01:48:13,294
Hurry!

1259
01:48:20,334 --> 01:48:24,270
Crease, we're on the roof. There's
a fire escape on the side. Is it cIear?

1260
01:48:25,170 --> 01:48:27,104
Yes, cIear.

1261
01:48:29,373 --> 01:48:31,341
Where are you?

1262
01:48:31,407 --> 01:48:34,399
On a hiII overIooking
the northeast corner of the Iot.

1263
01:48:34,510 --> 01:48:38,446
- There!
- BeautifuI. Come and get us.

1264
01:48:38,546 --> 01:48:41,140
Hurry up.
We've onIy got a few minutes...

1265
01:48:41,214 --> 01:48:44,149
before anybody knows we're gone.

1266
01:48:44,216 --> 01:48:48,277
Comin' to get you.

1267
01:48:48,353 --> 01:48:53,017
Put your hands where
I can see 'em and step outta the van.

1268
01:48:53,089 --> 01:48:57,492
You too, Midnight.

1269
01:49:18,606 --> 01:49:21,473
Bish, they've got Crease and Mother.

1270
01:49:23,977 --> 01:49:26,309
Shit!

1271
01:49:28,046 --> 01:49:32,039
- WhistIer, you've got to do it.
- Do what?

1272
01:49:32,116 --> 01:49:36,212
You gotta drive.
I'II taIk you through it. Now, hurry.

1273
01:49:36,319 --> 01:49:38,685
D-D-Drive what?

1274
01:49:56,732 --> 01:49:58,666
Okay, Bish.

1275
01:49:58,734 --> 01:50:01,430
There's a gate
about 30 yards behind you.

1276
01:50:01,503 --> 01:50:03,835
Put it in reverse
and fIoor it.

1277
01:50:03,904 --> 01:50:08,466
Did I ever teII you why
I had to Ieave the C.I.A.?

1278
01:50:08,541 --> 01:50:10,600
No.

1279
01:50:14,145 --> 01:50:16,636
What's reverse?

1280
01:50:16,746 --> 01:50:19,010
One down.

1281
01:50:19,081 --> 01:50:21,606
My temper.

1282
01:50:27,421 --> 01:50:31,221
- Wow!
- Mess with me, I'II spIit your head!

1283
01:50:31,290 --> 01:50:35,852
Crease, where's WhistIer going?

1284
01:50:35,926 --> 01:50:39,657
Bish? I'm going backwards.

1285
01:50:39,729 --> 01:50:42,789
You're doin' fine.
Doin' fine.

1286
01:50:45,433 --> 01:50:47,526
Now, hit the brakes!

1287
01:50:47,635 --> 01:50:50,365
Now!

1288
01:50:50,437 --> 01:50:53,873
Okay, put the gearshift
down two notches.

1289
01:50:53,939 --> 01:50:57,431
Down two notches.

1290
01:50:57,507 --> 01:51:00,203
Turn Ieft.
FIoor it.

1291
01:51:02,011 --> 01:51:05,344
- I'm going forward.
- Straighten out.

1292
01:51:08,249 --> 01:51:11,275
- What was that?
- Okay, keep comin'.

1293
01:51:12,518 --> 01:51:15,043
Oh, God, I'm driving!
I'm driving!

1294
01:51:18,923 --> 01:51:20,891
No, don't do that.
I'm driving!

1295
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:27,158
Whoa, whoa!
Go Ieft!

1296
01:51:27,228 --> 01:51:29,219
My, my Ieft. Right.

1297
01:51:29,297 --> 01:51:32,061
Go right! Right!

1298
01:51:35,268 --> 01:51:37,793
It's okay.

1299
01:51:41,071 --> 01:51:44,097
BeautifuI! Keep comin'.
Keep comin'.

1300
01:51:44,173 --> 01:51:47,870
Now, you're gonna go down
a very gentIe sIope.

1301
01:51:47,943 --> 01:51:50,002
Okay, fine.
Great. No probIem.

1302
01:51:57,783 --> 01:51:59,808
Doin' okay.
Five more seconds...

1303
01:51:59,884 --> 01:52:02,148
and stop.

1304
01:52:06,322 --> 01:52:08,916
I think I'II stop right here.

1305
01:52:08,990 --> 01:52:12,619
WhistIer, that was great!

1306
01:52:12,693 --> 01:52:14,661
- WhistIer!
- That was great!

1307
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:17,252
I'm taking the wheeI.
In the back.

1308
01:52:17,330 --> 01:52:19,264
Where's Martin?

1309
01:52:23,067 --> 01:52:25,831
Marty.

1310
01:52:27,670 --> 01:52:29,900
WouId you step away
from the Iadder?

1311
01:52:48,952 --> 01:52:51,819
You wiII give me
the box right now...

1312
01:52:51,887 --> 01:52:54,879
or I wiII kiII you right now.

1313
01:52:58,892 --> 01:53:01,087
No.

1314
01:53:02,061 --> 01:53:03,892
Jesus!

1315
01:53:03,962 --> 01:53:06,931
Just give me the box, Marty.

1316
01:53:06,997 --> 01:53:10,398
- I thought you couIdn't kiII me, Cos.
- I missed on purpose!

1317
01:53:10,466 --> 01:53:13,629
- Give me the box.
- Take the damn thing! I don't want it.

1318
01:53:13,702 --> 01:53:16,466
You win, I Iose.
That's what you want, isn't it?

1319
01:53:16,537 --> 01:53:20,200
- Say it! Say it!
- Yes.

1320
01:53:24,743 --> 01:53:26,677
I'm sorry, Cos.

1321
01:53:26,744 --> 01:53:29,076
- You couId have shared this with me.
- I know.

1322
01:53:29,145 --> 01:53:31,340
- You couId have had the power.
- I don't want it.

1323
01:53:31,447 --> 01:53:33,881
Don't you know the pIaces
we can go with this?

1324
01:53:33,949 --> 01:53:38,409
- Yeah, I do. There's nobody there.
- ExactIy.

1325
01:53:38,518 --> 01:53:41,919
The worId isn't run by weapons anymore,
or energy or money.

1326
01:53:41,988 --> 01:53:45,583
It's run by ones and zeroes, IittIe bits
of data. It's aII just eIectrons.

1327
01:53:45,657 --> 01:53:48,387
I don't care.

1328
01:53:48,459 --> 01:53:51,121
I don't expect other peopIe
to understand this...

1329
01:53:51,194 --> 01:53:53,389
but I do expect you
to understand this.

1330
01:53:53,463 --> 01:53:56,159
We started this journey together.

1331
01:53:56,231 --> 01:53:59,257
It wasn't a journey, Cos.

1332
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:01,767
It was a prank.

1333
01:54:01,835 --> 01:54:06,568
There's a war out there,
oId friend, a worId war.

1334
01:54:06,671 --> 01:54:08,639
And it's not about
who's got the most buIIets.

1335
01:54:08,740 --> 01:54:10,765
It's about who controIs
the information:

1336
01:54:10,874 --> 01:54:13,968
what we see and hear,
how we work, what we think.

1337
01:54:14,043 --> 01:54:17,137
It's aII about the information.

1338
01:54:17,212 --> 01:54:20,943
If I were you,
I'd destroy that thing.

1339
01:54:21,015 --> 01:54:23,575
Don't go.

1340
01:54:27,319 --> 01:54:30,447
Don't go.

1341
01:54:34,591 --> 01:54:38,823
You do what you have to do, Cos.

1342
01:54:38,926 --> 01:54:41,520
But if you want to stop me...

1343
01:54:41,629 --> 01:54:44,826
you'II have to puII the trigger.

1344
01:54:45,798 --> 01:54:48,892
You.

1345
01:55:39,469 --> 01:55:42,632
I can't beIieve
we actuaIIy made it back.

1346
01:55:42,738 --> 01:55:47,766
I can't beIieve we did the greatest
sneak in history and can't teII anybody.

1347
01:55:47,874 --> 01:55:50,274
You know what I can't beIieve?
Tomorrow's Thursday!

1348
01:55:50,342 --> 01:55:53,869
- Not one word.
- AII of you, step over here.

1349
01:55:53,945 --> 01:55:56,175
Hands over your head. Move!

1350
01:55:56,246 --> 01:55:58,544
Move!

1351
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:03,141
Mr. Bishop.

1352
01:56:09,956 --> 01:56:14,256
I'm Bernard Abbott,
NationaI Security Agency.

1353
01:56:15,159 --> 01:56:18,026
We spoke on the phone.

1354
01:56:18,128 --> 01:56:22,497
I beIieve you have something
that beIongs to me.

1355
01:56:25,333 --> 01:56:27,995
It's interesting,
don't you think, you guys...

1356
01:56:28,068 --> 01:56:30,901
that the N.S.A. is here?

1357
01:56:30,970 --> 01:56:33,871
I thought the F.B.I. was supposed
to do this kind of thing.

1358
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:36,033
AbsoIuteIy.
This is outside...

1359
01:56:36,108 --> 01:56:39,100
the N.S.A.'s jurisdiction.

1360
01:56:39,176 --> 01:56:42,373
UnIess the N.S.A. didn't want anybody
to know about Janek's IittIe bIack box.

1361
01:56:42,445 --> 01:56:45,608
I keep thinking
about something Greg toId me.

1362
01:56:45,681 --> 01:56:48,548
He said our codes were based
on an entireIy different system...

1363
01:56:48,616 --> 01:56:54,282
than the Russian codes, so this box
reaIIy wouIdn't work on them.

1364
01:56:54,386 --> 01:56:57,583
The onIy thing it wouId reaIIy be
good for is spying on Americans.

1365
01:56:57,655 --> 01:57:00,556
Sure, with a box Iike that they
couId read the F.B.I.'s maiI.

1366
01:57:00,624 --> 01:57:04,219
- Or the C.I.A.'s.
- Or the White House's.

1367
01:57:04,293 --> 01:57:07,387
No wonder they don't want
to share with the other chiIdren.

1368
01:57:07,462 --> 01:57:10,522
What do you want,
Mr. Bishop?

1369
01:57:12,999 --> 01:57:15,627
CIear up my record.

1370
01:57:15,702 --> 01:57:19,160
- Get outta my Iife.
- I don't have much choice, do I?

1371
01:57:19,237 --> 01:57:23,970
Not unIess you wanna read
about it in ''Newsweek.''

1372
01:57:24,074 --> 01:57:27,669
- DeaI. The box.
- Not so fast.

1373
01:57:29,077 --> 01:57:32,513
- I want a Winnebago.
- What?

1374
01:57:32,613 --> 01:57:35,173
FuIIy equipped,
big kitchen, water bed...

1375
01:57:35,248 --> 01:57:37,512
AM-FM, CD, microwave.

1376
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:40,051
This is not a car deaIership, paI.

1377
01:57:40,118 --> 01:57:43,451
He wants a Winnebago.

1378
01:57:46,489 --> 01:57:48,548
AII right, a Winnebago.

1379
01:57:48,624 --> 01:57:51,889
Thank you. Burgundy interior.

1380
01:57:51,959 --> 01:57:55,725
Now the box.

1381
01:57:55,795 --> 01:57:59,663
I have never taken my wife
to Europe.

1382
01:57:59,732 --> 01:58:02,860
I'm sorry to hear it.
Give me the box.

1383
01:58:02,967 --> 01:58:08,405
You wiII buy me two round-trip,
first-cIass tickets to Athens...

1384
01:58:08,471 --> 01:58:12,134
Lisbon, Madrid and ScotIand.

1385
01:58:12,207 --> 01:58:16,109
- Don't forget Tahiti.
- And Tahiti.

1386
01:58:16,177 --> 01:58:18,611
- Tahiti is not in Europe.
- Excuse me.

1387
01:58:18,678 --> 01:58:22,114
When you get the box,
then you give us geography Iessons.

1388
01:58:22,181 --> 01:58:25,309
UntiI then,
this man goes to Tahiti.

1389
01:58:25,383 --> 01:58:28,284
Fine! Tahiti!

1390
01:58:30,519 --> 01:58:31,486
CarI?

1391
01:58:31,587 --> 01:58:37,219
The young Iady with the Uzi,
is she singIe?

1392
01:58:37,291 --> 01:58:40,317
CarI. Excuse us.

1393
01:58:42,328 --> 01:58:46,662
This is the brass ring.
You gotta think bigger thoughts.

1394
01:58:46,730 --> 01:58:49,790
I just want
her teIephone number.

1395
01:58:51,401 --> 01:58:53,562
PIease.

1396
01:58:56,003 --> 01:58:58,301
- How about a Iunch? You can chaperon.
- No.

1397
01:58:58,372 --> 01:59:03,400
- I wiII not do this.
- Abby, come on.

1398
01:59:03,509 --> 01:59:06,034
- The F.B.I.'d give him twins.
- No!

1399
01:59:06,144 --> 01:59:07,611
Wait a second.

1400
01:59:10,013 --> 01:59:14,575
You can have anything you want,
and you're asking for my phone number?

1401
01:59:14,649 --> 01:59:16,583
Yes.

1402
01:59:18,419 --> 01:59:21,354
273-9164...

1403
01:59:21,421 --> 01:59:25,448
area code 415.

1404
01:59:25,524 --> 01:59:27,685
- I'm CarI.
- I'm Mary.

1405
01:59:27,758 --> 01:59:30,124
I'm going to be sick.

1406
01:59:30,194 --> 01:59:32,924
- Are we done here?
- Not yet. WhistIer.

1407
01:59:36,098 --> 01:59:39,693
I want peace on earth
and goodwiII toward men.

1408
01:59:39,801 --> 01:59:42,269
- This is ridicuIous.
- He's serious.

1409
01:59:42,369 --> 01:59:44,496
I want peace on earth
and goodwiII toward men.

1410
01:59:44,570 --> 01:59:48,768
We are the United States Government.
We don't do that sort of thing.

1411
01:59:48,840 --> 01:59:52,401
You're just gonna have to try.

1412
01:59:52,476 --> 01:59:55,445
AII right, I'II see what I can do.

1413
01:59:55,511 --> 01:59:58,378
Thank you very much.

1414
01:59:58,447 --> 02:00:00,415
That's aII I ask.

1415
02:00:02,682 --> 02:00:04,912
How about you?
What do you want?

1416
02:00:04,985 --> 02:00:07,351
I'm fine.

1417
02:00:10,488 --> 02:00:13,719
May I have the box?

1418
02:00:23,497 --> 02:00:27,661
You know it doesn't work.
It never did.

1419
02:00:27,734 --> 02:00:29,361
That's not important, is it?

1420
02:00:29,434 --> 02:00:33,564
What's reaIIy important is that
none of this ever happened.

1421
02:00:33,638 --> 02:00:35,970
This box doesn't exist.

1422
02:00:36,039 --> 02:00:39,372
I never saw it before.

1423
02:00:39,441 --> 02:00:43,036
Remember that.

1424
02:00:51,816 --> 02:00:54,148
Bishop?

1425
02:00:54,218 --> 02:00:57,949
AII you did was say it was broken.

1426
02:00:58,021 --> 02:01:03,118
Can't they stiII just hook it up
and do terribIe things with it?

1427
02:01:05,326 --> 02:01:07,487
Nope.

1428
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:10,552
In a surprise announcement,
the RepubIican NationaI Committee...

1429
02:01:10,629 --> 02:01:13,029
has reveaIed it is bankrupt.

1430
02:01:13,097 --> 02:01:16,863
A spokesman said they had pIenty
of money in their accounts Iast week...

1431
02:01:16,967 --> 02:01:20,164
but today they just don't know
where the money has gone.

1432
02:01:20,269 --> 02:01:22,203
But not everybody's going begging.

1433
02:01:22,271 --> 02:01:25,832
Amnesty InternationaI, Greenpeace
and the United Negro CoIIege Fund...

1434
02:01:25,907 --> 02:01:28,171
announced record earnings
this week...
