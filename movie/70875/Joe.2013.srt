1
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,964
嘿 你这个老家伙 你看着我
Hey, you old man. You look at me.

2
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,217
我有话跟你说
I got something to say to you.

3
00:00:50,134 --> 00:00:52,428
每次我们来到一个新的地方
Every time we land someplace new

4
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,682
你都说会有所不同 但事实并非如此
you say it's going to be different, but it ain't.

5
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,730
你把事情搞得一团糟
You mess up. A lot.

6
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:06,109
然后把烂摊子留给我 妈妈和多萝西来收拾
Then you leave a mess for me and Momma and Dorothy to clean up.

7
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:09,153
这是不对的 这就是我要说的
And that ain't right. That's all I'm saying.

8
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,823
见鬼 我做我该做的
Hell, I do what I gotta do.

9
00:01:12,323 --> 00:01:16,369
而你想怎么做就怎么做 只要你能逃脱惩罚
You do whatever the hell you want. Whatever you can get away with.

10
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,791
你只是个自私的老酒鬼
You're just a selfish, old drunk.

11
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,212
是的 你就是这样
Yeah, that's what you is.

12
00:01:29,632 --> 00:01:32,093
这个地方会盯上我们的
This place is gonna be after us.

13
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,053
见鬼 他们会盯上你的
Hell, they'll be on you

14
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:37,056
他们会狠狠揍你一顿
and they're going to beat your ass.

15
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,185
我讨厌看到你倒下
And I'd hate to see you go down.

16
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,438
你知道你是我爸爸
You know you're my daddy.

17
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,318
你知道你是谁 对吧
You know what you are, ain't you?

18
00:01:48,401 --> 00:01:50,194
我在说你呢
I'm talking at you.

19
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:01,205
你这次做了什么
What you done this time...

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,042
他们会打得你屁滚尿流 该死
They'll beat your ass. Shit.

21
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:06,336
这就是他们要做的
That's what they're gonna do.

22
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:10,298
你放心好了
You can count on it.

23
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:28,501
事实上 国家气象局已经发布了今天早上5:45
As a matter of fact, there was flood advisory in effect

24
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,336
的洪水预警

25
00:03:30,503 --> 00:03:33,297
但就在不久前 四点半的时候
But just a few moments ago, as of 4:30,

26
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:36,467
国家气象局取消了这一预警 
that has been lifted by the National Weather Service.

27
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,429
但根据多普勒雷达的估计
But was looking at some of the Doppler radar estimates,

28
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:42,974
看起来好像会有将近八厘米的降雨
and it looked as if close to three inches of rain

29
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:45,268
同时还伴有一阵小雷雨
fell with a little thunder storm...

30
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,734
-他们有葡萄吗 -是的

31
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:55,278
有葡萄 橘子 柠檬酸橙
They got grape, orange, lemon-lime,

32
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:57,238
果汁
fruit punch.

33
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,366
让我们在这个雨季回到这里
Got us back here in this monsoon.

34
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,202
集合了 朱尼尔
Round them up, Junior!

35
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,246
午饭时间还没到呢

36
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:06,956
集合了
Round them up.

37
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:10,877

Let's pack up the gear, guys! Let's get out of here. Let's go.

38
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,257
在这种雨里 什么都干不成
Can't get shit did out here in this rain.

39
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,635
我不知道他为什么把我们弄到这里来 乔
I don't know why he got us out here like this, Joe.

40
00:04:21,804 --> 00:04:23,264

Why y'all movin' so slow? You look like y'all goddamn turtles out here!

44
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,198
我们在淋雨呢

00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,700
我们走吧 你们都过来 离开这里

46
00:04:43,826 --> 00:04:45,036
来吧 我们离开这里
Come on, let's get out of here!

47
00:04:51,876 --> 00:04:54,253
该死的 乔 你打算什么时候买辆新卡车 乔
Damn, Joe. When you gonna get you a new truck, Joe?

48
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:55,963
这辆车有什么问题吗
What's wrong with this one?

49
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,675
该死 它太破了 你看不出有什么问题吗
Shit. It raggedy. You can't tell what wrong with it?

50
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,219
你不知道
You don't know?

51
00:05:01,302 --> 00:05:04,639
-是啊 你得再买一辆 -是的 老兄
- Yeah, you gotta get another one. - Yeah, man.

52
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:06,599
给我支烟
Let me get a cigarette.

53
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,566
这得从你的工资里扣了
Have to start taking this outta your pay.

54
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,907
那好吧
All right then.

55
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,117
如果明天出太阳的话我们再见
See you tomorrow if the sun comes up.

56
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:28,370
-明天早上找我 -现在就告诉我 -哦 耶
-Holla at me in the mornin', -and let me know, now. -Oh. Yeah.

57
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,250
把上衣放进去 把你的工作装备脱下来
Put the jerseys in there. Take your work gear off.

58
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,169
把你们所有的工作装备都放在这里
Leave all your work gear in here.

59
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:42,548
来吧 把工作装备放下 别再绕来绕去了 放在这里 拜托 过来 我们走吧 
Come on y'all, leave the work gear. Quit footin' around. Leave them here. Come on. Come here. Let's go. 

60
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,933
你可以看到降雨从墨西哥向北移动
And you can see the moisture moving northward out of Mexico

61
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,727
也进入了墨西哥湾
and also out into the Gulf of Mexico.

62
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,437
与这个锋系相遇
Meeting up with this frontal system,

63
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,523
慢慢地向南倾斜
which has slowly been sagging southward.

64
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:40,109
当我们观察云层的温度时
As we look at temperatures with the cloud cover,

65
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,153
没有我们现在看到的那么热
not as hot as what we've been seeing.

66
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,739
但降温与加拿大的空气无关
But the cool down isn't related to Canadian air.

67
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:48,034
这是加拿大东北部的空气
Here's some Canadian air over the northeastern part of the country.

68
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,954
露点非常高 这代表着有大量的水分
Very high dew points, this represents a whole lot of moisture available

69
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,541
上升到了那些高高的云层中 产生了大雨
to rise into those tall clouds producing the heavy rains.

70
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,960
所以今晚的阵雨和雷暴
So the showers and thunderstorms during tonight...

71
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:36,499
-早 朱尼尔 早 乔

73
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,962

Hittin' that woman on her ass like he retarded.

78
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,933

All right, I'll be up at Coleman's in 30 minutes. Y'all be ready.

我会去的 乔 再见
I'll be there, Joe. Bye-bye.

80
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,646
小个子 昨晚可真够难熬的
Shorty, that was a rough night last night.

81
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:01,399
今天早上差点没能去干活 小子
Almost didn't make it to work this morning, boy.

82
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:02,984
你会惊讶的
You'd be surprised.

83
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,653
边喝酒边想骚扰这位女士
Drinkin' and tryin' to touch this lady on her butt.

84
00:08:05,736 --> 00:08:07,363
我忍不住
I couldn't help myself.

85
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,075
你会没事的
Hey, you gonna be all right.

86
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:13,703

00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,007

店主雇我们来处理上面的东西
The owner hires us to get rid of what's on it,

165
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,991
这样他们就可以进来把结实的松树种在上面
so they can come in and put strong pines on it.

166
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,702
没人要这些树 这些树很脆弱
Nobody wants these trees, these trees are weak.

167
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,038
它们没有任何用处
They're not good for anything.

207
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,375
不是那只手 是你的右手 你的另一只右手
Not that hand, your right hand, your other right.

208
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:18,919
你的右手 好了

举起手来 你要发誓

你保证会努力工作吗 -是的 先生
- You promise to work hard? - Yes, sir.

212
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,805
好吧 因为我不知道乔为什么选择你 你一定是个好人
All right, 'cause I don't know why Joe chose you, you must be a good man.

213
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,890
我们要做的第一件事就是把这些容器装满
First thing we do is fill these containers up.

214
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,767
我们把它像这样放进去
We just gonna put it in there like that.

215
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,478
一旦填满 我们就继续
And once we get filled up real good, then we on.

216
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,813
这毒药里有什么
What's in the poison?

217
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:40,732
大便 矮子和他奶奶在地下室里做的
Shit. Shorty and his grandma make it in their basement.

218
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:42,943
我不知道里面有什么 但我们不用担心
I don't know what's in it, but we ain't gonna worry about that.

219
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:44,153
我知道它很管用

你觉得抽那玩意很容易 是吗
You thought that was easy pumpin' that thing, didn't you?

221
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,615
我让这看起来很容易 因为我是个男人
I made it look easy 'cause I'm a man.

222
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,578
你看 你是个小男孩 你得弄明白 明白我的意思了吗
See, you a little boy, you got to figure it out. See what I'm sayin'?

223
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:54,621
那就这样吧 看看你是怎么算出来的吧
There you go. See how you figured that out?

224
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,958
当你成为一个男人的时候 你也会把一切都弄清楚的
When you become a man, you gonna have everything figured out, too.

225
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:00,794
小心些而已 这东西真的有毒
Be careful. Now, this stuff is real poisonous.

226
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,005
如果它进入你的眼睛 伙计 你就离开那里
If it gets in your eyes, man, you out of there.

227
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:04,381
问问朱尼尔
Just ask Junior.

228
00:16:04,548 --> 00:16:06,717
现在给你
Now here you go.

229
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,470
你用哪只手
Which hand you use?

230
00:16:09,553 --> 00:16:10,804
-右手 -好的
- Right hand. - Okay.

231
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,766
把它加一点 然后继续扔
Prime it up a little bit, and keep slinging it.

232
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,145
如果你击打得足够用力 你只需要击打三四次就可以了
If you hit it hard enough, you only have to hit it three or four times.

233
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,980
一个 两个
One... Two...

234
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,316
你得对那棵树发火 伙计

239
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,119

241
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,165
乔的存在 他来过一段时间了 伙计
Joe's been around. He's been around a little bit, man.

242
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:41,251
他有很多事要做 伙计
He's got some things up under his belt, man.

243
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,046
所以我建议你 你去找乔的时候
So I advise you, when you do go to Joe,

244
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,797
跟乔说实话吧
keep it real with Joe.

245
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:47,716
不要对他撒谎
Don't lie to him about nothin',

246
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,260
乔有一点很特别 伙计
and one thing Joe is real particular about, man,

247
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,263
永远不要往下看 看着他的脸
don't ever look down at the ground. Look him in the face.

248
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,015
他喜欢看男人的眼睛
He likes to see a man's eyes.

249
00:16:55,098 --> 00:16:57,726
你 一对一 乔就是这样 伙计
You, one-on-one. That's how Joe is, man.

250
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,520
你从哪里
Where you from?

251
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,105
-无处不在 -在吗
- Everywhere. - Been around?

252
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,399
作为一个小男孩 你到处跑
Being a little bitty boy and you been everywhere?

253
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,985
你爸爸是当兵的吗
Was your daddy in the military or somethin'?

254
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,488
是吗 好吧 你有家庭吗
Yeah? All right. You got a family?

255
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,365
那好吧
All right then.

256
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,867
你知道我们不会放过你的 对吧
You know we ain't gonna cut you no slack out here, don't you?

257
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,202
只因你现在还年轻
Just 'cause you young, now.

258
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,413
你知道我们不会放过你的 每个人都有自己的负担 宝贝
You know we ain't gonna cut no slack. Everybody pulls they own load, baby.

259
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,374
一旦我们把这里填满
Once we get this filled up here,

260
00:17:20,457 --> 00:17:23,335
用这个我们可以杀死大约100棵树
we can kill us about 100 trees with this here.

261
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,587
砍伐树木是违法的吗
Is killing trees against the law?

262
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:30,926
嗯 木材公司不能把它们砍倒 除非它们死了
Well, the lumber company can't cut them down unless they dead.

263
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:33,595
所以木材公司雇我们进来

你为什么把枪从桥上扔下去

You need some money?

562
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,811
不 不是那样的
No, nothing like that.

563
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:59,320

564
00:38:01,113 --> 00:38:04,450
他回来了 我不想待在我妈家
He's back in town, and I don't wanna stay at my momma's.

565

回来乞求原谅

571
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:26,055
就像他一贯做的那样
Just like he always does.

572

Good, I'm glad you're done!

673
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:29,525
我很高兴你做完了 待完成
I'm glad you're done. Stay done.

674
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:34,738
看起来你的脸上有酵母感染
Look like you got a yeast infection on your goddamn face!

675
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,240
你混蛋
You country bastard.

676
00:43:55,217 --> 00:43:59,555
-你能逃出来吗 -是的 我想我会成功的
- Can you make it out of there? - Yeah. I'll make it, I guess.

677
00:44:00,055 --> 00:44:01,765
该死的屁股疼
Goddamn ass hurts.

678
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,144
来这里 儿子
Come here, son.

679
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,271
帮我越过这个后挡板
Help me get over this tailgate.

680
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,481
乔 你明早什么时候要我们回去
Joe, what time you need us back in the morning?

681
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:11,733
我不需要你明早回来
I don't need you back in the morning.

682
00:44:11,817 --> 00:44:13,819
你说不需要我们回去是什么意思
What do you mean, you don't need us back?

683
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:16,071
我们完成任务了 不是吗
We got the job done, didn't we?

684
00:44:16,905 --> 00:44:18,907
那是你的 孩子
That's yours there, son.

685
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,748
我们完成了任务 加里说我们得到了这份工作
We got the job done. Gary said we got the job.

686
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,500
乔 我会为你做任何事
Joe, I'll do anything you want.

687
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,502
清晰的笔刷 随时随地
Clear brush, anytime, anywhere.

688
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:31,879
我能行
I can do it.

689
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:34,214
乔 我想再多干点
Joe, I'd sure like to work some more.

690
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:35,674
是的 可能过几天吧
Yeah, maybe later.

691
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:37,384
我会让你知道的
I'll let you know.

692
00:44:41,763 --> 00:44:45,475
我不知道你做了什么让他生气了
I don't know what you did that made that man mad, or something.

693
00:44:45,559 --> 00:44:46,602
你听到我吗
You hear me?

694
00:44:55,485 --> 00:44:57,279
你到底在看什么
What the hell are you looking at?

695
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,794
只是一天
Just another day.

696
00:45:15,297 --> 00:45:17,049
这不是他的错
It ain't his fault.

697
00:45:17,549 --> 00:45:19,801
他爱我们 只是
He loves us, it's just...

698
00:45:22,554 --> 00:45:24,890
他只是经历了困难时期
He just goes through hard times.

699
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:40,614
我可不想看着他像打我一样坐在那儿打你 你听到我吗
Well, I ain't gonna watch him sit there and hit you like he hits me. You hear me?

700
00:45:40,697 --> 00:45:42,074
好吧 妈妈
Okay, Momma?

701
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,871
你不应该这样对任何人
You ain't supposed to do that to no one.

702
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,546
你和你的家人待在一起
You stay with your family.

703
00:45:59,341 --> 00:46:01,468
这就是你需要做的
That's what you need to do.

704
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:04,471
你得和家人待在一起
You need to stay with your family.

705
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:10,519
你的家人是你的一切
Your family's all you got.

706
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:26,535
那是什么
What was that?

707
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:29,830
我不知道
I don't know.

708
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,624
没听到车开过来的声音
Didn't hear no car drive up.

709
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,628
可能也没人 没人会有理智的
Probably ain't nobody. Ain't nobody with any sense out in this.

710
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,340
不能品尝
Can't taste that.

711
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:46,888
我们今晚出去吗
We gonna go out tonight?

712
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:49,891
不是真的
Not really.

713
00:46:52,936 --> 00:46:54,688
你想去哪里
Where you wanna go?

714
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,069
我不知道
I don't know.

715
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:05,699
我只是在想我们要不要做点什么
I was just wondering if we were gonna do something.

716
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,704
我认为你工作太多了
I think you work too much.

717
00:47:13,790 --> 00:47:15,459
我们该出去了
We should get out.

718
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:17,419
做一些有趣的事
Do something fun.

719
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,088
我没有这样的计划
I hadn't planned on it...

720
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,091
除非你想要
Not unless you want to.

721
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:30,265
我们不需要
We don't have to.

722
00:47:37,105 --> 00:47:38,690
有人在外面
There's someone out there.

723
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:40,275
不 不 等等
No. No, wait.

724
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:43,445
持有
Hold this.

725
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:55,874
嗨 乔 你能让那条狗过夜吗
Hey, Joe. Can you put that dog up?

726
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:58,418
地狱 我知道是谁
Hell. I know who it is.

727
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:03,632
天啊 你全身都湿透了
Boy, you're soaking-ass wet.

728
00:48:03,757 --> 00:48:06,176
你打算怎么做 整晚都站在那吗
What'd you plan to do, stand there all night?

729
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:09,096
他应该把湿衣服脱下来 他会生病的
He should get out of them wet clothes. He'll get sick.

730
00:48:09,179 --> 00:48:10,555
不 我很好 我只是
No, I'm all right. I just...

731
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,933
我只是想过来和你谈谈工作上的事
I just wanted to come by and talk to you about working some more.

732
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:15,727
工作吗 你没看到它在做什么吗
Work? Don't you see what it's doing out there?

733
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,146
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

734
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:19,731
嘿 我的饮料在哪儿
Hey, where's my drink at?

735
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,401
你有能让他穿的裤子吗 你的腰围是多少
You got any trousers he can wear? What size waist you got?

736
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:25,570
我想我有一些很酷的裤子可以让他穿
Well, I think I have some cool pants he can wear.

737
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:30,575
我敢打赌没人带着那只狗在这儿胡闹
I bet nobody come messing around here with that dog out there.

738
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:31,993
所以我才养了这只狗
Well, that's why I got the dog.

739
00:48:32,077 --> 00:48:34,413
狗在路上走不会打扰任何人
Dog won't bother anybody just walking down the road.

740
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:37,040
路不是狗的 狗知道什么是它的
Road ain't Dog's. Dog knows what's Dog's.

741
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:40,001
你可以直接走开 狗什么都不会做
You could've just walked on off, Dog wouldn't have done anything.

742
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,295
好吧 来 试试这个
All right. Here, try these on.

743
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,423
我想它们适合你
I think they'll fit you.

744
00:48:44,923 --> 00:48:46,341
这是浴室
Bathroom's this way.

745
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:49,761
狗是一只好狗
Dog is a good dog.

746
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,889
是啊 那只狗把我吓坏了
Yeah, that dog scared the hell out of me though.

747
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,184
他浑身是伤
He's all beat up.

748
00:48:58,186 --> 00:49:00,147
他的爸爸 我看见他做那件事
His daddy. I saw him do it.

749
00:49:02,732 --> 00:49:04,025
你什么
You what?

750
00:49:05,068 --> 00:49:09,489
怎么 你就坐在那看吗 还是别的什么
What, you just sat there and watched it? Or what?

751
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:11,908
他是个大孩子
He's a big kid...

752
00:49:15,203 --> 00:49:18,373
我不能把我的手弄脏每一件小事
I can't get my hands dirty in every little thing.

753
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:20,083
你知道我是怎么
You know how I get.

754
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:21,960
你是个成年人了 乔
You're a grown man, Joe.

755
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,712
你这话什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

756
00:49:24,254 --> 00:49:26,673
你想怎么说就怎么说
It can mean whatever you want it to mean.

757
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,384
别在我身上自欺欺人了
Don't fool yourself too much about me.

758
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:36,683
嘿 给你
Hey, there you go.

759
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:38,810
你看起来帅呆了
You look like a million bucks.

760
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:40,395
你现在感觉好点了吗
You feel better now?

761
00:49:42,230 --> 00:49:43,857
我感觉好极了
I feel like a hundred bucks.

762
00:49:44,983 --> 00:49:48,278
我来是想跟你谈谈我的工作
I come by 'cause I wanted to talk to you about my job.

763
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:52,741
我想工作 我需要一份工作
I wanna work and I need a job.

764
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:55,702
我爸爸不在乎他有没有工作 但我在乎
My daddy don't care if he gots a job, but I do.

765
00:49:56,077 --> 00:49:58,455
你会在这雨里工作的 对吧
You'd work in this rain, wouldn't you?

766
00:50:00,165 --> 00:50:01,750
如果你需要我
If you need me to.

767
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,340
让我穿上鞋 我送你回家
Let me slip my shoes on, and I'll run you back home.

768
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,390
我们马上就到 好吗
Hey, we'll be there in just a second, okay?

769
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:20,894

You know you don't have to take no shit from nobody, right?

771
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,526
你知道的 对吧
You know that, right?

772
00:50:28,109 --> 00:50:29,444

它不是太多 现在 看这里
It's not much. Now, look here.

784

When it dries up, you come down here early in the morning before light,

785

00:51:25,667 --> 00:51:27,794
你没必要一直叫我先生

793

我是你的朋友 你明白吗

Nothing.

798
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:20,597
我无能为力 我讨厌这样
There's nothing I can do and I hate it.

What are you thinking when you look at me like that? Don't you care?

803
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,285
我不知道我是谁
I don't know who I am,

804
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:49,709
但我知道能让我活下去的是克制

让我免于牢狱之灾

807
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:05,934
嘿
Hey.

808
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:11,481
这是某种该死的信仰的标志 表明一定有原因
A mark of some faith that there's a reason.

809
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:13,525
谢谢你
Thank you.

810
00:53:13,608 --> 00:53:15,610
这一切的原因
A reason for all of this.

811
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:20,198
大多数时候我都不应该做我想做的事
A reason in most moments I shouldn't do what I wanna do.

812
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,120
叫我怎么做我就怎么做
I do as I'm told.

813
00:53:25,912 --> 00:53:28,206
来吧 我们把东西装起来 我们离开这里吧
Come on, let's load up. Let's get outta here.

814
00:53:28,873 --> 00:53:32,085
这些拼命工作的人像狗一样工作
These men who bust their asses work like dogs.

815
00:53:33,294 --> 00:53:37,048
我相信它们 但它们每天都在伤害我
And I believe in them, but every day they hurt.

816
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:41,469
他们变老了 他们退缩了
They get old, they peel back...

817
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,306
刘易斯 朱尼尔
Lewis. Junior.

818
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:46,933
没有边界了
There's no frontier anymore.

819
00:53:47,016 --> 00:53:48,226
萨米
Sammy.

820
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:49,602
艾伦
Alan.

821
00:53:50,311 --> 00:53:51,479
克拉克

822
00:53:52,814 --> 00:53:53,940
加里
Gary.

823
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:56,818
我看着那个男孩
And I watch that boy.

824
00:53:58,403 --> 00:53:59,988
我看到某人
I see someone who's...

825
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:02,073
他和我一点都不像 但是
Who's nothing like me, but...

826
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:04,743
他只是个孩子 被遗弃的人们
He's a child, folks left behind.

827
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:08,204
他还在犹豫
And he's on the fence,

828
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:11,416
平衡
balanced right there.

829
00:54:15,628 --> 00:54:17,255
你想要什么
What do you want?

830
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,596
你想要什么
What is it you want?

831
00:54:26,848 --> 00:54:27,932
什么都没有
Nothing.

832
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:33,563
告诉我我能做什么
Just tell me what I can do.

833
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:38,985
我喜欢你
I like you.

834
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:45,074
我也喜欢你 但这有什么意义呢
I like you, too, but what's the point in any of it?

835
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:53,416
直到今天
to this day.

836
00:54:54,542 --> 00:54:56,795
我是说 直到今天
I mean, to this day.

837
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:05,386
一切都会沸腾起来 把我们冲走
It's all just gonna boil up and wash us away...

838
00:55:12,101 --> 00:55:14,229
也许你还会在这里
Maybe you'll still be here.

839
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,443
也许你不会
Maybe you won't.

840
00:55:31,037 --> 00:55:33,790
该死的 乔 你为什么一直把这些傻瓜装进这小卡车
Damn, Joe. Why you keep loading all these fools in this little truck?

841
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:35,208
很高兴你又来了 萨米
Good to have you with us again, Sammy.

842
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:37,293
如果再低一点 我们就得出去推
It drop down any lower, we gonna have to get out and push,

843
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:38,378
我什么也不逼你
and I ain't pushing shit.

844
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:40,672
乔 我以为他们把你们都装在新卡车上了
Joe, I thought they had y'all on a new truck, Joe.

845
00:55:40,755 --> 00:55:42,423
我不会买新卡车的
I ain't getting no new truck.

846
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:43,800
你需要一个
You need one.

847
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:45,176
不 我不喜欢
No, I don't.

848
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,637
乔 如果你买了一辆新卡车 这辆旧卡车你想要多少钱
Joe, if you get a new truck, how much you want for this old one?

849
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,347
你是说这破房子吗
You mean this old piece of junk?

850
00:55:49,430 --> 00:55:52,350
闻起来像是有人死了 这是令人讨厌的
Smells like somebody died up in there. It's nasty.

851
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:55,019
我不介意这味道 我喜欢它 我闻起来很香
I don't mind the smell. I like it. Smells good to me.

852
00:55:55,770 --> 00:55:57,313
是的 但是这件事
Yeah, but this thing,

853
00:55:58,439 --> 00:56:01,150
我花在驾驶上的时间和花在驾驶上的时间一样多
I spend as much time working on it as I do driving it.

854
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:04,195
当然 这没什么大不了的
Of course, there ain't nothing major wrong with it.

855
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,031
你知道 这只是一件小事 它需要刹车
It's just little shit, you know. It needs some brakes.

856
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:08,449
它需要
It needs...

857
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:12,120
乔 来吧
Joe. Come on.

858
00:56:12,912 --> 00:56:14,914
我跟你买 我会拼尽全力的
I'll buy it from you, I'll work my butt off.

859
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,333
我喜欢那辆卡车 你现在就得把它给我
I love the truck, you have to give it to me now.

860
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,085
我是说 这
Well, I mean, it's...

861
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,837
已经跑了很多英里了
It's got a lot of miles on it.

862
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,047
你最好在城里什么地方找一个
You'd be better finding one in town somewhere.

863
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:26,050
我可不想在镇上有 我喜欢那个
Well, I don't want one in town. I like that one.

864
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,469
来吧 乔
Come on, Joe.

865
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,641
好吧 我九百买了
All right, I'll take $900 for it,

866
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,059
如果我有一辆新卡车
if I get a new truck.

867
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:37,228
好吧 握手
All right! Shake hands.

868
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:39,647
这就是我说的 见鬼 是的
That's what I'm talking about. Heck, yeah.

869
00:57:09,844 --> 00:57:11,095
嘿
Hey,

870
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,889
你拿的是什么
what you got there?

871
00:58:46,607 --> 00:58:47,734
嘿
Hey!

872
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:51,779
我在想你能不能告诉我怎么去水谷
I was wondering if maybe you could tell me how to get down to Water Valley.

873
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,366
我妻子 她在下面的医院里
My wife, she in the hospital down there.

874
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,201
我刚到这儿
I just now got here.

875
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,204
你知道有多远吗
You know how far it is?

876
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:05,793
这是通往那里的高速公路吗
Is that the highway that goes to it?

877
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:07,795
是吗
Is it?

878
00:59:08,838 --> 00:59:10,506
你喝什么
What you drinking?

879
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,966
什么都没有
Nothing.

880
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,968
没有什么
Nothing?

881
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:20,641
你不是在喝酒吧
You ain't drinking some wine, are you?

882
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,810
我可能
I may...

883
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:24,353
是啊 这没什么错
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

884
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:27,398
有些人认为一个人根本不应该喝酒
Some folks think a feller ought not drink at all,

885
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,359
但喝点酒不会伤害任何人
but a little drink never hurt nobody.

886
00:59:30,443 --> 00:59:31,903
这是正确的
That's right.

887
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:35,364
我偶尔会在家里喝点酒
I get me a little drink every now and then when I'm down at the house,

888
00:59:35,448 --> 00:59:38,826
但是老太太 她扬起了很多沙子
but the old lady, she raises so much sand about it,

889
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:41,579
我在那里不怎么喝酒
I don't do a lot of drinking down there.

890
00:59:41,662 --> 00:59:44,832
我通常会像现在这样等到上城区
I usually wait until I get uptown like I am now.

891
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,459
给我拿杯喝的
Grab me a drink.

892
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:51,255
她好吗
She all right?

893
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,299
是的 她今天是
Well, yeah, she is today.

894
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:57,220
所以我才要去水谷 去看看她
That's why I'm trying to get down there to Water Valley, to go see about her.

895
00:59:57,845 --> 01:00:00,056
我今天应该拿到工资的
I supposed to get paid today,

896
01:00:00,139 --> 01:00:02,683
但那个老家伙 他一直没出现
but the old fella, he never showed up.

897
01:00:03,768 --> 01:00:06,896
我想我还是去喝点东西吧
You know, so I think I'll go get me a little drink,

898
01:00:06,979 --> 01:00:10,233
去水谷看看她怎么样了
go down to Water Valley and go see how she's doing.

899
01:00:10,858 --> 01:00:12,902
她在医院吗
She in the hospital?

900
01:00:12,985 --> 01:00:16,364
是的她在医院里她得了癌症
Yeah, she in the hospital. She got cancer.

901
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,075
把它吃完 吃遍全身
Just eat up with it, all over.

902
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:22,203
你知道的 该死的
You know, damn thing...

903
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:25,414
你知道的 一个人只是一天到一天都不知道
You know, a person just don't know from one day to the next

904
01:00:25,498 --> 01:00:27,834
哪一个会是他们最后一个
which one's gonna be their last.

905
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:35,842
外面天气很好 但是
Hell, it's a beautiful day out, but

906
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:38,594
我感到骨头里有一丝寒意
feeling a little chill in my bones.

907
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,847
我想天要下雨了
I think it's fixing to rain.

908
01:00:40,930 --> 01:00:43,766
看来要下雨了
Look like it's fixing to rain some...

909
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,637
是的 我们开始吧
Yeah. Here we go...

910
01:02:26,035 --> 01:02:29,038
三只非洲彩绘狗
Three African painted dogs,

911
01:02:29,455 --> 01:02:34,126
野生狗在动物园杀死了一个三岁的孩子
wild dogs, killed a three-year-old in a zoo.

912
01:02:34,752 --> 01:02:36,337
一个蹒跚学步的孩子
A toddler...

913
01:02:36,837 --> 01:02:38,839
他掉下去撞到了头
He fell in, hit his head,

914
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:40,925
狗抓住了他
the dogs got him.

915
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:44,553
每个人都在什么地方
Where was everybody?

916
01:02:57,483 --> 01:02:59,235
他还是个小孩子
He was a little kid.

917
01:03:09,203 --> 01:03:10,454
你好 乔
Hello, Joe.

918
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:12,373
你过得如何
How you doing?

919
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:18,879
婊子养的
Son of a bitch.

920
01:03:20,756 --> 01:03:22,675
我跟你说 伙计
I tell you what, buddy.

921
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:27,847
这该死的反反复复反反复复
All this goddamn back and forth and back and forth.

922
01:03:29,932 --> 01:03:31,726
我他妈的受够了
I'm  over it.

923
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:34,729
地狱
Hell,

924
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:39,984
也许是时候
maybe it's time we just...

925
01:03:40,776 --> 01:03:42,028
过去的
Bygones.

926
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:51,495
你知道我会杀了你的 对吧
You know I could have killed you, right?

927
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,539
我本可以杀了你 但我没有
I could have killed you, but I didn't.

928
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:56,625
我打败了你 我瞄准的是树
I licked you, I was aiming for the trees, see.

929
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:59,670
那一枪是用来警告的
That shot was meant as a warning shot.

930
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:01,672
因为你一直在让我难堪
'Cause all you keep doing is embarrassing me

931
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,758
在我该死的朋友面前
in front of my goddamn friends.

932
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:09,263
我是说 上次你打我的时候有女士和先生在场
I mean, hell, last time you slapped me there was ladies and gentlemen present.

933
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:17,855
你给你打工的那个孩子是怎么回事
So what's this shit I hear about this kid you got working for you?

934
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:21,442
小流浪汉的孩子
Little drifter kid,

935
01:04:21,525 --> 01:04:23,069
这么大呢
about yay big?

936
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:28,199
我一点都不在乎他
I don't really give a shit about him,

937
01:04:28,282 --> 01:04:31,452
但我怀疑你知道他住哪儿 对吧
but I suspect you know where he lives, don't you.

938
01:04:32,787 --> 01:04:33,788
没有
No?

939
01:04:37,833 --> 01:04:39,627
怎么了 幽灵
What's wrong, spooky?

940
01:04:40,461 --> 01:04:42,296
还在生我气吗
Still sore at me?

941
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:02,441
克里斯蒂 在有人被杀之前报警
Kristy, call the cops before somebody gets killed.

942
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:05,027
你能帮我吗 亲爱的
Will you do that for me, honey?

943
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:28,342

01:16:11,985 --> 01:16:14,321
他说你有一次被关进了大监狱
He said you got put up at the big jail one time.

1087

1088

我因为袭击警察在监狱里待了29个月
I did 29 months in the penitentiary for assault on a police officer.

They pulled me over behind a shopping center uptown.

1092
01:16:35,133 --> 01:16:36,802
这一个官
This one officer,

1093
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,762
华学校类型的家伙
pretty-boy type guy,

1094
01:16:38,845 --> 01:16:40,055
和我有点矛盾

我以为我和他认识的一个女孩有关系
Thought I had something to do with one of the girls he knew.

1096
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:46,103
我不知道他到底在说什么
And I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.

1097
01:16:46,853 --> 01:16:48,980
然后他们想朝我开枪
Then they tried to shoot me,

1098
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:51,775
我把他们三个都打得屁滚尿流
after I beat the shit out of all three of them.

1099
01:16:51,858 --> 01:16:53,276

01:17:02,869 --> 01:17:06,039
他准备杀了我 他告诉我的
Well, he was fixing to kill me, he told me he was.

1103
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,962
他只是炸掉了自己的膝盖骨
All he did was blow his kneecap off...

1104
01:17:13,338 --> 01:17:14,714
愚蠢的人

1105
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,636
我的狗昨晚跑了
My dog run off last night.

1106

01:17:28,186 --> 01:17:31,565
-你想让我开卡车 -总有一天要开始
- You want me to drive the truck? - Gotta start sometime.

1109
01:17:31,815 --> 01:17:33,817
现在看 不要向他们挥手
Now look. Don't wave to them.

1110
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:36,319
因为当你挥手的时候 他们知道你是有罪的
Because they know you're guilty of something when you wave.

1111
01:17:36,403 --> 01:17:37,487
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1112
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:40,407
是啊 只要警察愿意 他可以把你搞得一团糟

1113
01:17:41,283 --> 01:17:42,826
是的 我犯了错误
Yeah, I made the mistakes,

1114
01:17:42,909 --> 01:17:46,496
但他们是永远不会让我忘记的人
but they're the ones that won't ever let me live it down.

1115
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:49,916
我能向你买一瓶啤酒吗
Hey, can I buy one of them beers off of you?

1116

我不知道

01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:57,007
这些啤酒你可以喝 但你不能从我这里买
You can drink one of these beers, but you cannot buy one from me.

1118
01:17:57,090 --> 01:18:00,218
朋友不需要从我这里买东西
Friends don't ever need to buy things from me.

1119

1120
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:06,308
现在 睁大你的眼睛
Now, keep your eyes peeled.

1121
01:18:06,391 --> 01:18:08,351
是为了警察还是为了狗
For the cops or the dog?

1122
01:18:08,935 --> 01:18:10,145
这两个
Both...

1123
01:18:13,023 --> 01:18:14,649
警察还是狗
Cops or the dogs.

1124

1125
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:19,529
这声音能让妓女们兴奋起来
That's the sound that gets the hookers excited.

1126
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:22,282
他们知道你有钱 他们听到这个消息
They know you got cash. They hear that...

1127

1133
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:43,553

1134
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:45,513
妈的 还是我来开吧

That boy's a good worker.

1221
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,463
这是我这辈子做过的最辛苦的工作
That's the hardest  work I ever done in my life.

1222
01:24:11,047 --> 01:24:12,799
-是吗 -是的
- Is it? - Yeah.

1223
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:15,593
-你付钱给我儿子 -什么
- You paying my boy? - What?

1224
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:17,971
-你付钱给我儿子了吗 地狱 是啊
- Are you paying my boy? - Hell, yeah!

1225
01:24:18,596 --> 01:24:20,557
我没见他拿过一分钱
I ain't seen he got paid none.

1226
01:24:20,640 --> 01:24:22,767
他攒钱可能是因为他很聪明
Well, he probably saves it 'cause he's smart.

1227
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,644
向我买这个GMC
Buying this GMC off of me.

1228
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:26,604
做什么
Doing what?

1229
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:29,274
-什么都没有 -是的
- Nothing. - Yeah.

1230
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:32,193
他没那么聪明
He ain't so smart.

1231
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:33,945
他什么都不知道
He don't know nothing.

1232
01:24:35,405 --> 01:24:37,240
见鬼 你也不知道
Hell, neither do you.

1233
01:24:41,619 --> 01:24:43,830
我就一枪崩了你
I'm gonna shoot you straight.

1234
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:50,295
那个男孩拼命地工作
That boy works his ass off!

1235
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:52,922
他赚的钱
He's earned money,

1236
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:54,507
这是他的
and it's his!

1237
01:24:55,592 --> 01:24:57,218
如果这辆车是坨屎
If this truck's a piece of shit,

1238
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:59,095
那你就得摆脱它
then you need to get out of it.

1239
01:24:59,178 --> 01:25:02,140
如果我发现那孩子出了什么事
And if I find out something has happened to that boy,

1240
01:25:02,348 --> 01:25:05,518
我要把跟这事有关的人痛打一顿
I'm gonna whip whoever's ass had something to do with it.

1241
01:25:06,394 --> 01:25:08,104
现在给我滚远点
Now get the hell away from me,

1242
01:25:08,187 --> 01:25:11,316
在我把你剩下的牙齿敲掉之前
before I knock what's left of your  teeth out.

1243
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:38,176
我今天有个非常有趣的想法
I had the funniest thought today.

1244
01:25:43,514 --> 01:25:47,852
我想也许我们可以一起出去吃晚饭
I thought maybe you and I could go out to dinner.

1245
01:25:51,981 --> 01:25:53,274
你知道吗
You know?

1246
01:25:54,317 --> 01:25:56,069
穿戴整齐
Get all dressed up.

1247
01:25:59,489 --> 01:26:03,993
也许你可以帮我把门打开
And maybe you could hold the door open for me.

1248
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,422
我觉得那样很好
I think that would be nice.

1249
01:26:22,762 --> 01:26:24,764
你假装睡着了
You pretend to be asleep,

1250
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:30,311
但我知道如果我说错了你会哭的
but I know you'd cry if I said the wrong thing.

1251
01:26:56,504 --> 01:26:58,589
你知道这地方是被废弃的吧
You know this place is condemned, right?

1252
01:26:59,382 --> 01:27:03,219
你不能把窗户上的木板拿下来就把一个地方叫做家
You can't just take boards off windows and call a place home.

1253
01:27:07,473 --> 01:27:09,892
加里 你为什么要这样留下来
Gary, why do you stick around like this?

1254
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:14,230
你够大了 够聪明了 可以做你自己的事了
You're old enough, smart enough, to do your own thing.

1255
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,192
现在最重要的是我
What's most important right now is me

1256
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:20,319
照顾多萝西和妈妈
taking care of Dorothy and Momma,

1257
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:24,824
因为我们现在有点家庭问题
'cause we kinda got a family problem right now.

1258
01:27:30,413 --> 01:27:31,497
嘿 那里
Hey, there.

1259
01:27:32,165 --> 01:27:33,207
嘿 现在
Hey, now...

1260
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:37,044
她话不多 是吗
Don't talk much, does she?

1261
01:27:38,212 --> 01:27:39,547
她根本不说话
She don't talk at all.

1262
01:27:39,630 --> 01:27:40,882
什么意思
What do you mean?

1263
01:27:41,257 --> 01:27:44,093
我不知道 没有人知道 有一天她停下来了
I don't know. Nobody knows. She just stopped one day.

1264
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:46,012
我是说她以前会 但是
I mean she used to would, but...

1265
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:57,523
好吧 我准备好跟你做这笔交易了 如果你愿意的话
Well, hey, I'm ready to make this deal if you are.

1266
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:59,317
是的
Yeah.

1267
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:00,943
我拿到钱了
I got my money.

1268
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:02,987
嘿 G-Daawg
Hey! G-Daawg.

1269
01:28:06,657 --> 01:28:09,285
你以为我忘了吗 伙计
Don't you think I forgot about it, bud.

1270
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:13,372
我一直在找你和那个孩子
I've been looking for you and that kid.

1271
01:28:14,707 --> 01:28:16,334
你的那个男孩
That boy of yours,

1272
01:28:16,876 --> 01:28:19,212
他肯定以为自己知道些什么
he sure thinks he knows something.

1273
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:21,464
我了解你 先生
I know you, mister.

1274
01:28:21,547 --> 01:28:23,049
你我的朋友吗
You my friend?

1275
01:28:24,592 --> 01:28:26,385
我不是你的朋友
I ain't your friend.

1276
01:28:26,844 --> 01:28:29,764
你喜欢做各种鬼脸
Well, you like to make all them funny faces.

1277
01:28:29,972 --> 01:28:31,349
我说 你是我的朋友吗
I said, are you my friend?

1278
01:28:31,432 --> 01:28:33,184
听着 老兄
Listen, buddy.

1279
01:28:34,894 --> 01:28:38,314
我想我知道一个让我们成为朋友的方法
I think I know a way that you and me can be friends.

1280
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,074
在这里
There it is.

1281
01:28:51,369 --> 01:28:55,164
它和你的旧的一模一样 小长春花蓝 我喜欢它
It looks just like your old one. Periwinkle blue. I like it.

1282
01:28:55,748 --> 01:28:57,416
我希望如此
I hope so.

1283
01:28:59,043 --> 01:29:01,671
现在 你有足够的汽油回家
Now, you got plenty of gas to get home.

1284
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:03,381
你最好去趟科尔曼家
You might want to stop at Coleman's

1285
01:29:03,464 --> 01:29:06,509
如果你打算骑着它到处跑的话 再多放一点
and put a little more in it if you plan to ride around.

1286
01:29:06,592 --> 01:29:07,885
在这里
Here.

1287
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:10,012
-那是什么 -是买卡车的钱
- What's that? - It's money for the truck.

1288
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:11,556
地狱 我不担心这个
Hell. I ain't worried about that.

1289
01:29:11,639 --> 01:29:15,518
你只要把它放回口袋就行了 你会需要它来买保险的
You just stick it back in your pocket. You're gonna need it for insurance.

1290
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:17,937
-保险是什么 -是啊 这是法律
- What's the insurance? - Well, yeah, it's a law.

1291
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:20,022
没有保险你不能开车
You can't drive without insurance.

1292
01:29:20,106 --> 01:29:23,359
你现在有保险 但我签字后 你得去拿保险
You're covered now, but when I sign it over, you gotta pick up the insurance.

1293
01:29:23,442 --> 01:29:25,486
我告诉你 你不久就会来我家
I'll tell you what, you come out to the house before long,

1294
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,904
我们会把你治好的
we'll get you fixed up.

1295
01:29:26,988 --> 01:29:28,614
我要继续 你没事吧
I'm gonna go on. You gonna be all right?

1296
01:29:28,698 --> 01:29:30,449
-是的 先生-好的
- Yes, sir. - All right.

1297
01:29:32,535 --> 01:29:34,036
要我跟着你吗
You want me to follow you?

1298
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,621
不 我没事
No, I'll be all right.

1299
01:29:37,790 --> 01:29:39,041
嗨 乔

1300
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:41,544

1301
01:31:06,337 --> 01:31:08,130
-漂亮的卡车 -谢谢
- Nice truck. - Thanks.

1302
01:31:08,714 --> 01:31:10,508
你身上没有任何标签 你刚拿到了吗
You ain't got any tags on it. Did you just get it?

1303
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:11,717
是的
Yeah.

1304
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:13,386
你想给我吹口气吗
You wanna breathe into this for me?

1305
01:31:13,469 --> 01:31:15,012
不 我不想对着它呼吸
No, I don't want to breathe into that.

1306
01:31:15,096 --> 01:31:16,806
嘿 嘿 嘿
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1307
01:31:50,923 --> 01:31:52,216

Pull over!

1308
01:31:53,759 --> 01:31:55,094
靠边
Pull over!

1309
01:32:05,396 --> 01:32:08,357
该死的 我什么都没做
God damn it! I ain't done a goddamn thing!

1310
01:32:08,441 --> 01:32:09,942
-待在车里 -我没醉
- Stay in your vehicle! - I ain't drunk.

1311
01:32:10,026 --> 01:32:12,528
你最好找个人来捣乱 因为我什么都没做
You better look for someone else to mess with, 'cause I did nothing!

1312
01:32:12,611 --> 01:32:14,864
-把你的手放在背后 -你和你那些该死的朋友
- Put your hands behind your back. - You and your mother friends

1313
01:32:14,947 --> 01:32:16,365
你再惹我 我就揍你
keep messing around with me, I'm gonna hurt you...

1314
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,616
把手放在 后面
Put your hands behind your...

1315
01:32:18,659 --> 01:32:19,869
来这里
Come here!

1316
01:32:21,370 --> 01:32:22,455
我想如果我现在开车走
I guess if I drive off now,

1317
01:32:22,538 --> 01:32:24,790
你要从后面拿枪射我吗
you're gonna get your shotgun out of the back and shoot me?

1318
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,083
-没有 -你要开枪打我
- No. - You gonna shoot me?

1319
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:27,293
-没有 -你能行的
- No. - You can do it.

1320
01:33:07,458 --> 01:33:08,793
这是快速的
That was quick.

1321
01:33:09,251 --> 01:33:11,170
那只坏狗还在吗
Still got that badass dog?

1322
01:33:11,837 --> 01:33:13,923
对 就在这附近
Yeah, around here somewhere.

1323
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:15,382
等一下
Hold on a minute.

1324
01:33:16,133 --> 01:33:17,551
别担心 好吧
Don't worry, okay.

1325
01:33:17,635 --> 01:33:19,762
别担心 别担心
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1326
01:33:19,845 --> 01:33:21,180
别担心
Don't worry.

1327
01:33:22,848 --> 01:33:24,183
好吧
All right.

1328
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:29,688
我听说你有了个新孙子
I hear you got a new grandbaby.

1329
01:33:29,897 --> 01:33:32,108
-我该怎么办 -是啊 你不知道
- I do? - Yeah, you didn't know?

1330
01:33:32,817 --> 01:33:34,235
直到现在
Not until now.

1331
01:33:35,361 --> 01:33:36,821
是的 小男孩
Yeah. Little boy.

1332
01:33:36,904 --> 01:33:38,823
玛西在教堂见过他
Marcy saw him at church.

1333
01:33:40,366 --> 01:33:43,202
他说他长得和你想的一样
Said he looked just like you'd expect him to look.

1334
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:47,748
她说他的眼睛像你
She said he's got your eyes.

1335
01:33:51,627 --> 01:33:52,878
你没事吧
You okay?

1336
01:33:53,712 --> 01:33:55,798
你儿子长大了 不是吗
Your son's all grown now, ain't he?

1337
01:33:56,048 --> 01:33:57,424
是啊 都长大了
Yeah, all grown up.

1338
01:33:57,508 --> 01:33:59,677
他要做什么 执法
What's he going into? Law enforcement?

1339
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:01,554
(我是这么听说的 )
That's what I heard.

1340
01:34:02,930 --> 01:34:05,891
你现在有新的手下了 是吗
You got a new man working for you now, don't you?

1341
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:07,518
是的 我喜欢
Yes, I do.

1342
01:34:07,893 --> 01:34:09,562
我想你已经见过他了
I believe you've met him.

1343
01:34:09,645 --> 01:34:11,814
同心协力的家伙 有点太急切了
Gung ho fella, a little over-eager.

1344
01:34:11,897 --> 01:34:14,024
他只是想找人来耍耍
He was looking for someone to play with.

1345
01:34:14,108 --> 01:34:15,943
是的 也许是这样
Yeah, maybe so.

1346
01:34:16,026 --> 01:34:20,698
我会让他好好整理一下文件直到他能冷静下来
I'll have his ass shuffling papers for a while until he learns to cool down a little bit.

1347
01:34:21,240 --> 01:34:23,367
但我担心的不是这个
But that ain't what I'm worried about.

1348
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:26,954
你能把辣酱递给我吗
Will you pass the hot sauce?

1349
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:33,752
我问你个问题 乔 因为我真的很想知道
Let me ask you a question, Joe, 'cause I really want to know.

1350
01:34:34,628 --> 01:34:36,422
你为什么想回去
Why you wanna go back?

1351
01:34:36,755 --> 01:34:39,925
你为什么要回监狱 伙计
Why you wanna go back to the damn penitentiary, man?

1352
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:47,391
因为你不能老是去别人家
Because you can't keep going to folks' houses,

1353
01:34:47,474 --> 01:34:50,436
杀了他们的狗 不管发生了什么
killing their dogs, don't matter what else is going on.

1354
01:34:50,519 --> 01:34:52,938
你不能一直跟法律打架
And you can't keep fist-fighting the law.

我应该给你上拳击课的

我不需要什么该死的拳击课 我知道该怎么做
I don't need no goddamn boxing lesson. I know what to do.

我就一枪崩了他的眼睛
I'll pop him right in the eye.

1385
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:03,504
他打了我一顿 把我扔出了卡车
He whooped my ass and threw me out the truck.

1386
01:38:03,837 --> 01:38:05,839
因为他知道我会杀了他
Because he knew that I was gonna kill him.

1387
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,470
我真想杀了他
I could kill his ass.

1388
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:14,431
我也能像你一样杀了他

我知道你可以 我知道你可以

1391
01:38:19,186 --> 01:38:21,355
但你没必要这么做
But you don't have to do that.

1392
01:38:22,022 --> 01:38:23,357
好吧 儿子

1393
01:38:24,108 --> 01:38:25,984
跟我待在这儿
Just stay here with me.

你在这里会很安全
You'll be safe here.

1395

我会带上你妈妈和妹妹

他遇到了一些坏人

1399
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:41,166
我听到他谈论这件事

1400
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:44,086
那个脸上有疤的男人
That man with the scarred-up face,

1401
01:38:44,169 --> 01:38:46,839
我在桥上撞到的那个

1402
01:38:49,383 --> 01:38:52,302
他一直在找我因为我对他做了什么
He's been looking for me for what I done did to him.

1403
01:38:53,011 --> 01:38:55,180
她没有伤害任何人 乔
She didn't hurt nobody, Joe.

1404
01:38:56,265 --> 01:38:58,183
应该是我
It should have been me.

1405

I'll kill you both if you move.

1430
01:43:04,262 --> 01:43:06,807
乔 听我说 这个 不是你想的那样 伙计
Joe, listen to me. This... It ain't what it looks like, man.

1431

I'm telling you.

1432
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,102

她什么都不知道 伙计
She don't know shit about shit, man.

1444
01:43:48,181 --> 01:43:50,517
她和她爸爸一样是个废物
She's just a piece of trash just like her daddy.

1445
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:53,562
我跟你说 她很快就会这么做的
And she's gonna be doing this shit in no time, I'm telling you.

1446
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:54,896
我告诉你 伙计
I'm telling you, man.

1447
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,648
看月亮

1448
01:44:18,211 --> 01:44:19,296

1449
01:44:24,509 --> 01:44:26,136
该死的狗屎
Damn this shit.

1450
01:44:28,054 --> 01:44:30,307
如果你想开枪 那就开枪吧
If you want to shoot me, go ahead and shoot me.

1451
01:44:30,390 --> 01:44:33,059
我撞穿了挡风玻璃 我才不管
I went through a windshield and I don't give a...

1452
01:45:51,388 --> 01:45:53,348
你是我的朋友吗
Are you my friend?

1453
01:47:47,837 --> 01:47:50,090
你做了什么 乔
What have you done, Joe?

1454
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:16,528
我们是这么做的
Here's what we do.

1455
01:50:17,195 --> 01:50:21,366
我们开始得有点晚 大约早上8点 一直到4点
We start a little late, around 8:00 in the morning, and we go until 4:00.

1456
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:24,869
我周五按周付工资 有些日子我们走得很长
I pay by the week, on Fridays. Some days we go long.

1457
01:50:24,953 --> 01:50:28,623
如果一周工作超过40个小时 我就付1.5倍的工资
If we run past 40 hours a week, I pay time and a half.

1458
01:50:29,290 --> 01:50:30,542
这是艰苦的工作
It's hard work.

1459
01:50:31,209 --> 01:50:33,253
我不喜欢一直站着
I don't like a whole lot of standing around.

1460
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:37,632
我们可能会竭尽全力在四月底前把这事搞清楚
We'll probably bust our ass and get this spread out by the end of April.

1461
01:50:37,715 --> 01:50:39,801
把所有的裸根苗都拔掉
Get out all the bare root seedlings.

1462
01:50:39,884 --> 01:50:43,263
有时候 为了让小家伙们保持稳定 我们会用木桩钉住它们
Sometimes, we stake them if we got to keep the little ones stable.

1463
01:50:43,346 --> 01:50:48,143
大多数情况下 我们不需要像这样弄松苗
Most of the time we don't need to mess with them little pine seedlings like that.

1464
01:50:48,226 --> 01:50:52,480
我要你加入农场西端的唐•L和他的团队
I'm gonna have you join Don L. and his crew on the west end of the farm.

1465
01:50:52,564 --> 01:50:54,858
如果那片地一切顺利
Then if everything goes good on that acreage,

1466
01:50:54,941 --> 01:50:59,279
明年夏天我会让你帮我监督马涅亚项目
I'll have you help me supervise the Manea project next summer.

1467
01:50:59,696 --> 01:51:02,699
有时候给老混蛋工作很不容易
Old bastards can be hard to work for sometimes.

1468
01:51:03,366 --> 01:51:05,660
但如果你为乔工作
But hell, if you worked for Joe,

1469
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:08,580
我想你会做得很好的
I think you'll do just fine.

1470
01:51:09,289 --> 01:51:10,832
你有什么问题吗
You got any questions?

1471
01:51:10,915 --> 01:51:12,667
没有 先生 我什么时候可以上班
No, sir. When can I start?

1472
01:51:12,750 --> 01:51:14,294
现在 如果你准备好了的话
Right now, if you're ready.

1473
01:51:14,377 --> 01:51:15,670
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

1474
01:51:17,672 --> 01:51:19,215
这么说你认识乔
So you knew Joe?

1475
01:51:19,299 --> 01:51:20,508
是的 当然了
Yeah, sure did.

1476
01:51:20,592 --> 01:51:22,260
乔是个好人
Joe's a good man.

1477
01:51:22,677 --> 01:51:24,596
反正对我来说是个好男人
Good man to me anyways.

1478
01:51:26,264 --> 01:51:27,390
对我来说也是个好男人
Good man to me too.
