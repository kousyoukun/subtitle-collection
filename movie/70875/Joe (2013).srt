1
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:45,964
嘿 老头 看着我
Hey, you old man. You look at me.

2
00:00:46,965 --> 00:00:49,218
我有话要跟你说
I got something to say to you.

3
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:52,429
每次我们去到新的地方
Every time we land someplace new

4
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,682
你说会不一样 结果却没有
you say it's going to be different, but it ain't.

5
00:01:00,354 --> 00:01:02,731
你坏了事 很多事
You mess up. A lot.

6
00:01:02,814 --> 00:01:06,109
然后留给我 妈妈和多萝西去帮你收拾残局
Then you leave a mess for me and Momma and Dorothy to clean up.

7
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:09,154
这样是不对的 我就想这么说
And that ain't right. That's all I'm saying.

8
00:01:09,696 --> 00:01:11,823
不管怎样 我做了我该做的事情
Hell, I do what I gotta do.

9
00:01:12,324 --> 00:01:16,370
你总是想做就做 能不做就不做
You do whatever the hell you want.Whatever you can get away with.

10
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:21,792
你就是个自私的老酒鬼
You're just a selfish, old drunk.

11
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,213
没错 那就是你
Yeah, that's what you is.

12
00:01:29,633 --> 00:01:32,094
这个地方的人将捉拿我们
This place is gonna be after us.

13
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:34,054
他们会找到你
Hell, they'll be on you

14
00:01:34,554 --> 00:01:37,057
然后揍你一顿
and they're going to beat your ass.

15
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,186
我不愿意看到你被打死
And I'd hate to see you go down.

16
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,438
因为你是我爸爸
You know you're my daddy.

17
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,318
你知道自己是谁 对吗?
You know what you are, ain't you?

18
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,195
我在跟你说话
I'm talking at you.

19
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:01,206
你这次干的事...
What you done this time...

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,042
他们肯定会揍你一顿 该死
they'll beat your ass. Shit.

21
00:02:04,126 --> 00:02:06,336
他们会这么干的
That's what they're gonna do.

22
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:10,299
你可以等着那一天
You can count on it.

23
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,502
事实上 洪水警报原定于今天早上5:45
As a matter of fact, there was flood advisory in effect

24
00:03:28,585 --> 00:03:30,337
开始生效

25
00:03:30,504 --> 00:03:33,298
但就在不久前 大概在4:30
But just a few moments ago, as of 4:30,

26
00:03:33,465 --> 00:03:36,468
国家气象服务中心将警报时间提前了

27
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,429
但根据多普雷雷达估计
But was looking at some of the Doppler radar estimates,

28
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:42,974
降雨量接近三英寸
and it looked as if close to three inches of rain

29
00:03:43,058 --> 00:03:45,268
伴随着局部的雷阵雨...
fell with a little thunder storm...

30
00:03:51,316 --> 00:03:52,734
- 他们摘到葡萄了?  - 是

31
00:03:52,818 --> 00:03:55,278
他们有葡萄 橘子 酸柠檬
They got grape, orange, lemon-lime,

32
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:57,239
果汁酒
fruit punch.

33
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:00,367
这种季风天气还让我们来
Got us back here in this monsoon.

34
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,203
让他们集合 朱尼尔!

35
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:05,247
还没到午餐时间呢

36
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,957
让他们集合

37
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,877
把工具收起来 各位! 我们离开这里 走吧
Let's pack up the gear, guys! Let's get out of here. Let's go.

38
00:04:13,755 --> 00:04:16,258
雨这么大 在外面什么也做不了
Can't get shit did out here in this rain.

39
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:19,636
我不明白他为什么让我们这么出去 乔
I don't know why he got us out here like this, Joe.

40
00:04:21,805 --> 00:04:23,265
我们去把他们送走
Let's go get them packs off.

41

Why y'all movin' so slow? You look like y'all goddamn turtles out here!

44
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:40,198
我们都在淋雨啊
It's gettin' rain on us.

45
00:04:40,699 --> 00:04:42,701
走啦! 你们全都过来 离开这里

Come on, let's get out of here!

47
00:04:51,877 --> 00:04:54,254

Damn, Joe. When you gonna get you a new truck, Joe?

48
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:55,964
这辆车有什么问题?
What's wrong with this one?

49
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,676
废话 这辆太破 你不能告诉我们它有什么问题吗?
Shit. it raggedy. You can't tell what wrong with it?

50
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,219
你不知道?
You don't know?

51
00:05:01,303 --> 00:05:04,639
- 是啊 你得换辆车了  - 是啊 老兄
- Yeah, you gotta get another one.  - Yeah, man.

52
00:05:04,723 --> 00:05:06,600
给我根烟
Let me get a cigarette.

53
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,567
必须开始从你工资里扣了
Have to start taking this outta your pay.

54
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,908
好啦
All right then.

55
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,118
要是明天出太阳了再见
See you tomorrow if the sun comes up.

56
00:05:25,202 --> 00:05:27,370
早上来叫我 要叫醒我啊
Holla at me in the mornin', and let me know, now.

57
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:32,250
把衣服放那里 把工具都放下
Put the jerseys in there. Take your work gear off.

58
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,170
所有工具都留在这里
Leave all your work gear in here.

59
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:38,548
你们快点 把工具留下 走的时候小心周围
Come on y'all, leave the work gear. Quit pussyfootin' around.

60
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:30,934
大家可以看到雨水往北移出墨西哥
And you can see the moisture moving northward out of Mexico

61
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,727
进入墨西哥湾
and also out into the Gulf of Mexico.

62
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:34,437
遇到前面的
Meeting up with this frontal system,

63
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,524
缓慢南移的气流
which has slowly been sagging southward.

64
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:40,110
我们看云层覆盖下的温度
As we look at temperatures with the cloud cover,

65
00:06:40,193 --> 00:06:42,153
并不像我们所看到的那么热
not as hot as what we've been seeing.

66
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,739
但气温下降和加拿大气流并没有关系
But the cool down isn't related to Canadian air.

67
00:06:44,823 --> 00:06:48,034
这是位于城市东北部上空的部分加拿大气流
Here's some Canadian air over the northeastern part of the country.

68
00:06:48,118 --> 00:06:51,955
露水点非常高 这代表有大量的水分能够
Very high dew points, this represents a whole lot of moisture available

69
00:06:52,038 --> 00:06:55,542
上升到这些高空云层 形成暴雨
to rise into those tall clouds producing the heavy rains.

70
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,961
因此今晚的暴雨和雷阵雨...
So the showers and thunderstorms during tonight...

71
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:36,499
- 早 朱尼尔  - 早 乔

- He what?  - Hell, yeah. Almost got arrested.

77
00:07:47,594 --> 00:07:50,430
他像个弱智一样打那女人的屁股
Hittin' that woman on her ass like he retarded.

78
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:53,933
好吧 三十分钟后我会去柯尔曼那边 你们都准备好
All right, I'll be up at Coleman's in 30 minutes. Y'all be ready.

79
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,061
我会去的 乔 拜拜
I'll be there, Joe. Bye-bye.

80
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,647
矮子 昨天晚上过得真不容易啊
Shorty, that was a rough night last night.

81
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,399
今早差点就不能上班了 兄弟
Almost didn't make it to work this morning, boy.

82
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:02,984
你都想不到自己干了什么
You'd be surprised.

83
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,654
喝醉了以后 想去摸这个女人的屁股
Drinkin' and tryin' to touch this lady on her butt.

84
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:07,364
我实在忍不住
I couldn't help myself.

85
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:11,076
嘿 你会没事的
Hey, you gonna be all right.

86
00:08:11,576 --> 00:08:13,703

92
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,007
这根本说不通 你知道吗?
That don't make no sense though, you know?

00:08:37,727 --> 00:08:39,312

99
00:08:39,396 --> 00:08:40,689

You tell Sammy I'm gonna fire him for good if he don't start helping me out some.

104
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,618

Those boys played one hell of a game.

107
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,375
- 谁赢了?  - 当然是我们

Shorty, if you had one like this, you'd be a bad boy. God damn.

111
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:07,048

好 砍光这些树

131
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:01,556
我发现一条蛇!

有条蛇在这里!

最好当心点 老兄

134
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:08,229
我不确定 它看起来像条毒蛇 嘴巴非常大

141
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,918
不管怎样 我抓到一条更大的 乔

让我看看那条蛇
Let me see that snake.

149
00:13:00,907 --> 00:13:02,116
长得很好对吗?
Ain't he a nice one?

150
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:05,662
看到哪些毒牙了吗?
See those fangs?

151
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,748
你要是被毒牙咬了 你会死的
You get bit by those and you're gonna die.

152
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:09,999
你会生不如死
You're gonna wanna die.

153
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:12,961
你们别杀它
Y'all don't kill it.

154
00:13:13,044 --> 00:13:14,545
它是我的朋友
He's my friend.

155
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,632
妈的 乔 别把它扔给我!

156
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:19,676
嘿 你们都回去干活

157
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,010
表演结束啦
The show is over with.

158
00:13:21,094 --> 00:13:23,680
- 我听到你尖叫了  - 我没有尖叫 我只是跑走了
- I heard you screamin'.  - I wasn't screamin', I just move fast.

159
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:25,431
随你怎么说

160
00:13:25,515 --> 00:13:28,017
你们都在干嘛? 你们都在砍树吗?
What are y'all doing? Y'all cutting these trees?

161
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:31,396
我们在杀树
We're killing trees.

162
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,439
为了什么?
What for?

163
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,067
清干净地皮
Neidermeyer land.

164
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:39,779
老板花钱请我们把上面的东西全都除掉
The owner hires us to get rid of what's on it,

165
00:13:40,446 --> 00:13:43,992
这样他们就能进来 把强壮的松树种上去
so they can come in and put strong pines on it.

166
00:13:44,075 --> 00:13:46,703
没人想要这些树 这些树都快死了
Nobody wants these trees, these trees are weak.

167
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:49,038
它们拿去做什么都不够好
They're not good for anything.

168
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:52,709
要是我不盯着他们 那些小伙子会坐下来偷懒
These boys will sit down if I don't stay on their asses.

169
00:13:53,042 --> 00:13:54,627
- 嘿 先生?  - 嗯?
- Hey, mister?  - Yeah?

170

我有个问题想问你

Well you've got forty-five seconds to tell me why I should hire you.

177
00:14:13,021 --> 00:14:16,566

181
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,034

183
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:28,453
我叫乔

184
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,830
干一天活 领一天的工资
I pay a day's pay for a day's work.

185
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:33,708

I pay on Fridays, so you'll get a little something today,

186
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:36,085
但你第一个正式领工资的日子是下周五
but your first real payday is next Friday.

187
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,671
我们早上六点左右开工

188
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,132

If we work till dinner or get rained out, I pay for the whole day.

大概走半英里就能回到我的车
Close to a half a mile back to my truck.

193
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:51,726
果汁斧头在后备箱
The juice hatchets are in the back.

194
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:54,270
你给自己拿一个 涂满毒药

195
00:14:54,353 --> 00:14:56,355
然后沿着原路返回

200
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:05,531

Raise your right hand. You're gonna have to swear

206
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:14,457
你会努力为我工作
that you're gonna work hard for me.

207
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:16,375
不是那只手 你的右手 另外一只
Not that hand, your right hand, your other right.

208
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:18,920
你的右手 就是这只
Your right hand, there you go.

209
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:21,089
把手举起来 你要发个誓
Put your hand up, you gotta swear on somethin'.

210
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,300

00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:26,260
- 你保证努力干活?  - 是的 先生
- You promise to work hard?  - Yes, sir.

212
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:29,806
很好 虽然我不知道乔为什么会选择你 但你肯定是个不错的人
All right, 'cause I don't know why Joe chose you, you must be a good man.

213
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,891
我们做的第一件事就是把这些容器装满
First thing we do is fill these containers up.

214
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,768
我们就像这样把它放进去
We just gonna put it in there like that.

215
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:36,479
一旦我们很好地装满了 我们就出发
And once we get filled up real good, then we on.

216
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,814
毒药里有什么?
What's in the poison?

217
00:15:37,897 --> 00:15:40,733
天知道 矮子和他的奶奶在地下室做的
Shit. Shorty and his grandma make it in their basement.

218
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,944
我不知道里面有什么 但我们不必担心这个
I don't know what's in it, but we ain't gonna worry about that.

219
00:15:43,027 --> 00:15:44,153
我知道它很好用就够了
I know it work real good.

220
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:46,781
你觉得这东西很容易抽 是吗?
You thought that was easy pumpin' that thing, didn't you?

221
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,616
看起来我做得容易 因为我是个男人
I made it look easy 'cause I'm a man.

222
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:52,578
看看你这个小男孩 你得搞定它 明白我的意思吗?
See, you a little boy, you got to figure it out. See what I'm sayin'?

223
00:15:52,662 --> 00:15:54,622
去吧 看看你怎么搞定它?
There you go. See how you figured that out?

224
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,959
等你长成男人了 还有大把事情要你去搞定
When you become a man, you gonna have everything figured out, too.

225
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,795
小心点 现在 这东西真的是有毒的了
Be careful. Now, this stuff is real poisonous.

226
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:03,005
要是它进了你的眼睛 小弟 你就得走了
If it gets in your eyes, man, you out of there.

227
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:04,382
不懂就问朱尼尔
Just ask Junior.

228
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:06,717
现在开始吧
Now here you go.

229
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,470
你用哪只手?
Which hand you use?

230
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:10,805
- 右手  - 好
- Right hand.  - Okay.

231
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:14,767
出手前抬高一点 不停地挥
Prime it up a little bit, and keep slinging it.

232
00:16:14,851 --> 00:16:18,146
要是你砍得够用力 你只要砍三四次就可以了
If you hit it hard enough, you only have to hit it three or four times.

233
00:16:18,229 --> 00:16:19,981
一... 二...
One... Two...

234
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,316
你要对树生气 小弟
You got to get angry at the tree, man.

235
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:24,360
对它疯狂起来 没错 我喜欢这样的
Get mad at it. Yeah, I like that.

236
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:26,404
对它疯狂起来 继续砍它
Get mad at it. Keep on workin' it.

237
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,199
砍它 砍它!
Work with it, work with it!

238
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,076
好的 先生! 明白!
Yes, sir! Get it!

239
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:34,120
继续砍 年轻人
Keep on with it, youngster.

240
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,621
我喜欢这样 小弟
I like that, man.

241
00:16:35,705 --> 00:16:38,166
乔一直在周围 他一直在周围不远 小弟
Joe's been around. He's been around a little bit, man.

242
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:41,252
他的腰带下有样东西 小弟
He's got some things up under his belt, man.

243
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:44,046
所以我建议你 你要是真的跟着乔干
So I advise you, when you do go to Joe,

244
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,798
要对乔保持诚实
keep it real with Joe.

245
00:16:45,882 --> 00:16:47,717
任何事情都不要骗他
Don't lie to him about nothin',

246
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,261
还有一个乔真的很特别的地方 小弟
and one thing Joe is real particular about, man,

247
00:16:50,344 --> 00:16:53,264
别看地板 要看着他的脸
don't ever look down at the ground. Look him in the face.

248
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:55,016
他喜欢看着别人的眼睛
He likes to see a man's eyes.

249
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,727
就跟你 一对一 乔就是这样
You, one-on-one. That's how Joe is, man.

250
00:16:57,977 --> 00:16:59,520
你从哪儿来?
Where you from?

251
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:02,106
- 没有固定的地方  - 在这附近?
- Everywhere.  - Been around?

252
00:17:02,231 --> 00:17:04,400
你还这么小就没有固定去处?
Being a little bitty boy and you been everywhere?

253
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,986
你爸爸是军人还是什么的吗?
Was your daddy in the military or somethin'?

254
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,488
是吗? 好吧 你家在这边吗?
Yeah? All right. You got a family?

255
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,365
好吧
All right then.

256
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,868
你知道我们不会对你有例外 对吧?
You know we ain't gonna out you no slack out here, don't you?

257
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:15,203
因为你现在还太小嘛
Just 'cause you young, now.

258
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:18,414
我们是不会放松的 每个人都要背自己的装备
You know we ain't gonna out no slack. Everybody pulls they own load, baby.

259
00:17:18,497 --> 00:17:20,374
只要我们把这东西装满了
Once we get this filled up here,

260
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:23,336
我们就能砍一百棵树
we can kill us about 100 trees with this here.

261
00:17:23,586 --> 00:17:25,588
伐木不违法吗?
Is killing trees against the law?

262
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:30,927
除非树死了 木材公司才能砍
Well, the lumber company can't cut them down unless they dead.

263
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,596
所以木材公司雇我们
And so the lumber company hire us to come in

264
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:35,348
来荼毒这些树
and poison the trees.

265
00:17:35,431 --> 00:17:38,142
所以我们可以砍树 然后让这些树自己死
So we can kill them and they come in and die themselves.

266
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,102
我已经砍了好一阵子树枝了
Yeah, I been doing this for a little minute now.

267
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:42,021
- 欢迎加入  - 谢谢
- Welcome to the program.  - Thanks.

268
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,397
这个活儿还比较轻松
It's hard work out here.

269
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:46,234
你要用弯刀把这些东西都砍掉
Well, the machete crew is the one that comes through and clears it out.

270
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:47,693
砍到差不多你脚踝的高度
Chop down at your angles.

271
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,278
越低越好
Try to get as low as you can.

272
00:17:49,362 --> 00:17:52,365
你得为你的队友砍出一条路
You got to clear the path for your teammates.

273
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,825
没有你 一切都没戏
Without you, none of this is gonna happen.

274
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,871
要不断的砍 绝对不要停
And just keep hammering at it. Nothing stopping you.

275
00:17:58,955 --> 00:18:02,041
恩 你开始砍吧 等一下你可能得当一会儿送水工
Yeah, you start out, you'll probably be the Waterman for a little while.

276
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,502
你得帮他们每个人跑腿
It's gonna look like you're doing everything for everyone,

277
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,880
给他们送水 最后 你就会成为一个弯刀高手
bringing them water. At the end, you'll become a machete vet.

278
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:09,882
武士之王 就在这里
Samurai kings, right here.

279
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:15,263

Welcome to the crew, you the youngest. Gotta crawl before you walk.

280
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:16,973
你很有活力
You got a lot of energy there.

281
00:18:18,724 --> 00:18:19,850

There you go.

282

Crew! When y'all get through with this side over here,

284
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:29,110
我们就去西边

285
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,486

抱歉
Sorry.

310
00:20:50,876 --> 00:20:52,294
把那畜生关起来了?
Got that asshole put away?

311
00:20:53,003 --> 00:20:55,005
好了 乔 已经把他关在后面了
Yes, Joe. He's in the back.

312
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:57,591
要是那畜生再咬我...
That asshole bites me again...

313
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,219
好吧 他本性就那么狂暴
Well, he's got the devil in him.

314
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:01,512
去他妈的
Fuck that.

315
00:21:01,971 --> 00:21:03,013
进来吧 宝贝
Come on, baby.

316
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,648
你看看
Look at that.

317
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,948
墨西哥游戏节目 我说的就是这个
Mexican game show. That's what I'm talking about.

318
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:22,950
你要喝点儿什么 宝贝?
Can I fix you somethin', baby?

319
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:24,410
可乐 加冰

320
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:37,715
给你 亲爱的
Here you go, sweetie.

321
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:47,475
怎么看起来闷闷不乐的 乔
So what you got the blues over, Joe?

322
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:50,060
没那么糟吧
I'm not so bad.

323
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:53,230
要不要来个姑娘?
Want one of my girls?

324
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,693
还是要两个?
You want two of my girls?

325
00:21:58,194 --> 00:21:59,487
今天不要
Not today.

326
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,405
今天是特别的日子
Today is a special day.

327
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:03,574
是吗?
It is?

328
00:22:04,325 --> 00:22:06,660
我只想让你陪我 梅尔
I only want your company, Merle.

329
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,001
- 谢谢  - 过来
- Why, thank you.  - Come here.

330
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:25,137
把那个畜生带走!
Put that asshole away!

331
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:28,599
蕾西! 把狗关到后院
Lacy! Put the dog in the back.

332
00:22:29,266 --> 00:22:31,268
好了 我知道了
Come on. I got it.

333
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:32,937
过来
Come on.

334
00:22:35,606 --> 00:22:38,442
你不需要那玩意儿照顾你
You don't need that thing to take care of you.

335
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:42,821
你要去哪儿 乔?
Where are you going, Joe?

336
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:52,331
姑娘 给我站起来
Girl, get your ass off the floor.

337
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,542
别犯二了
Quit being stupid.

338
00:23:16,146 --> 00:23:17,940
你看到那是谁了没?
You see who that was?

339
00:23:18,023 --> 00:23:19,191
看到了
Yes.

340
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,069
那是一战还是二战时候的? 你哪儿来的那帽子?
What is that World War I or II? Where'd you get that hat?

341
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:23,529
- 二战的帽子  - 这样啊
- Ww II.  - Right.

342
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,573
我在参加海陆军的时候拿到的
Got it down there at the Army-Navy.

343
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,409
我在亨利之家玩骰子赢了不少钱
I've been making some money over at Henry's house, throwing the dice.

344
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,537
是啊 我知道 我本来还打算去那儿把他赢个干净的
Yeah, I know. I was gonna go over there later and clean him out.

345
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,038
我可能在那儿见到你
Maybe I'll see you there.

346
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:35,958
我非常擅长从那些老太太那里赢钱
I've been doing pretty good taking the money from them old ladies

347
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,127
那些老太太经常和和还有老瞎子乔治一起出去
that he and old Blind George hang outwith.

348
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:41,839
我有百分之六七十的胜率
I take about 60 or 70% of my winnings

349
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,966
然后我把钱全捐给糖尿病研究
and donate it to diabetes research.

350
00:23:45,676 --> 00:23:47,177
但是后来我就把剩下的钱
But then I take the rest of it

351
00:23:47,261 --> 00:23:49,221
都用来买战争用品了
and buy war paraphernalia.

352
00:23:49,305 --> 00:23:51,807
总有一天我会成为一个正规的美国军
One of these days, I'm gonna be a regular GI Joe.

353
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,351
荒野大镖客!
Fistful of dollars!

354
00:23:54,518 --> 00:23:56,270
差不多就这种
Something like that.

355
00:24:10,284 --> 00:24:11,535
亨利!
Henry!

356
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:12,828
里面 乔!
In here, Joe!

357
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:14,580
你跟我说你知道怎么弄的
You told me you knew how to do this.

358
00:24:14,663 --> 00:24:16,165
嘿 乔
Hey, Joe.

359
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,792
你怎么样啊? 今天忙什么了?
How you been doin'? What are you up to today?

360
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,045
- 谁来了?  - 亨利已经弄得一团糟了
- Who's that?  - Henry's just making a damn mess.

361
00:24:21,128 --> 00:24:23,589
- 你在干嘛呢 亨利?  - 我不知道
- What are you tryin' to do, Henry?  - I don't know.

362
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,549
- 他弄得太糟了  - 我没有割鹿肉的经验
- He's making a damn mess.  - I don't have experience

363
00:24:25,633 --> 00:24:26,967
知道吗?
to cut this deer, you know?

364
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,970
这鹿真大 但是要知道 想要剔骨烤肉的话...
It's big one, you know, but tryin' to out it in roasts, you know, but...

365
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:31,972
是啊 不过我觉得我是不会切了拿去烤的
Yeah, well, I don't think I would cut it into a roast.

366
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:33,098
不会
No.

367
00:24:33,223 --> 00:24:36,393
你想怎么样都行 不过要是我的话 我会切成肉排
You can do anyway you want to, but if it was mine, I'd cut it into steaks.

368
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:38,896
过来给他看看应该怎么弄 宝贝
Come over here and show him how to do it, honey.

369
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:42,441
亨利 你赶紧坐那儿 给我讲讲笑话唱唱歌什么的吧
Henry, you can sit down there and tell me a joke or sing a song or something.

370
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:44,902
好吧 该死 你应该也让瞎子乔治来切一切
Well, shit. You might as well just let Blind George cut it up.

371
00:24:44,985 --> 00:24:46,153
我要去坐着了
I'm gonna sit down.

372
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:48,280
我是说 乔治也可以切
I mean, George could cut it up.

373
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:50,324
只要你给他足够的时间 不是吗 乔治?
If you gave him enough time, couldn't you, George?

374
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,910
我觉得我能比他们切的都好
I reckon I can do better than they are doing it.

375
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:54,453
不可能
No.

376
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,331
好吧 我给你们示范一下怎么切肉排
All right. I'll show you how to make the steaks.

377
00:24:57,414 --> 00:25:00,376
那真是太好了 宝贝儿 我爱死里脊了
That'll be good, baby. I love backstrap.

378
00:25:00,459 --> 00:25:02,753
扶住点儿 没错 就是这样
Hold on here. That's good, that's enough.

379
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,765
现在看看这只可怜的鹿会有什么下场
Now look what happened to the poor thing.

380
00:25:14,848 --> 00:25:17,518
流了一地的血 天啊
All that blood on the floor, God.

381
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:25,526
你哪儿弄来的这头鹿?
Where'd you get this deer?

382
00:25:25,609 --> 00:25:29,154
它就在李先生的围栏那边晃来晃去
It was hung up on the fence, over at Mr. Lee's.

383
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,950
亨利和我正好从烤博饼店出来
And Henry and I was coming back from the IHOP

384
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:36,328
然后我带着我的点三八手枪 然后一枪给它爆头
and I took out my .38 and shot her in the head.

385
00:25:37,705 --> 00:25:41,041
宝贝 你用刀的感觉就像是艺术家用画笔
Honey, you use that knife just like an artist's brush.

386
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,961
我是说你这手艺真不错 乔
I mean, you know what you're doing, Joe.

387
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,505
伙计 来看看这个
Man, look at that.

388
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,215
天啊...
Man...

389
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:49,717
这块肉相当不错
There's some good stuff here.

390
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,052
- 的确很不错  - 现在 你看
- That is some good stuff.  - Now, look here.

391
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:56,140
伙计 真的太棒了
Man, that is pretty.

392
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,308
没错 棒极了
Yes, wonderful.

393
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:02,146
你要这么切 蝴蝶型的肉排
That's how you do it. Butterfly steak.

394
00:26:02,855 --> 00:26:04,857
- 太棒了  - 看到我怎么切的了吗?
- Wonderful.  - You see how I did that?

395
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,568
那就在这里 这里 还有这里切开
Now do it here, here, and here.

把这只手放在这儿
Take this hand right here,

448
00:29:27,184 --> 00:29:30,687
想象你在海上随波飘荡
pretend it's going over a wave like you're out there in the ocean.

449
00:29:30,771 --> 00:29:34,066

457
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:52,918
这样可一点都不好玩
That shit ain't funny at all.

458
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:54,711
我要把我的酒拿回来

你知道锁舞吗?
You know what locking is?

465
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,726

I really can't do a whole lot of locking unless I'm...

466
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:11,645

- 那么就站起来 快点  - 我看不到在不远的将来
- Well, stand up, come on.  - I don't see myself doing much of that

468

I know you're drunk because you're about to spill it.

470
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:23,240
我为什么要把酒撒了呢? 我只是需要个枕头
Why would I spill it? I need a pillow.

471
00:30:25,242 --> 00:30:27,911

再说一次?
Say it again?

477
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:57,024
我和我爸爸想知道你能不能顺路载我们去镇上

He's back that a way.

483
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:13,957
你为什么要把枪扔下去?
What did you chunk that gun off the bridge for?

484
00:31:17,335 --> 00:31:18,962
我只是扔了它
I just threw it.

485
00:31:20,338 --> 00:31:21,631
你知道吗?
You know?

486
00:31:22,507 --> 00:31:26,386
武器会让人们做出暴力的事情
Weapons tend to make men do violent things.

487
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:29,056

几天前晚上 我在酒吧里扇了一个混蛋一巴掌

00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,011
我也记不得了
Neither do I.

559
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:45,932
你想跟我说什么来着?
So what was it you wanted to talk about?

560
00:37:46,015 --> 00:37:47,267
需要钱吗?
You need some money?

561
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,812
不是的
No, nothing like that.

562
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:59,320
你知道那个叫弗兰克的家伙吗? 那家伙吗?
You know that guy, Frank? The guy?

563
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:04,451
他回来了 我也不想住在我妈那
He's back in town, and I don't wanna stay at my momma's.

564
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,327
我记得你妈把他赶走了

他回来是想求得原谅的
Came back begging for forgiveness.

568
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:20,884
我妈说只要他不来烦我 他想待多久就可以待多久
She said he could stay as long as he promised to leave me alone.

569
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,470
他也答应了
And he promised.

570
00:38:24,095 --> 00:38:26,055
他之前的几次也是这么答应的
Just like he always does.

571
00:38:26,264 --> 00:38:27,474
但是...

- Man, you got about six other people! out there.  - You ain't did shit all goddamn day!

664
00:43:10,089 --> 00:43:11,591
我说了 给我干活去!
I told you to goddamn get to working!

665
00:43:11,674 --> 00:43:13,968
要么你就他妈的赶紧给我走!
You gotta get your ass outta my motherfucking job!

666
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:16,471
那你现在就跟乔说! 去跟他说啊!
Go tell Joe right now! Go tell him!

667
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:19,390
乔很快就不得不把你赶走 或者对你做点什么
Joe goddamn gonna have to get rid of you or do something different.

668
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:20,808
今天有事要发生
Something gonna change today.

669
00:43:20,892 --> 00:43:23,519
因为明天我再也不要见到这个混蛋
'Cause tomorrow we ain't gonna have this bullshit.

670
00:43:23,603 --> 00:43:25,605
- 你说完了吗?  - 没错 我他妈的说完了...
- Are you done?  - Yeah, I'm done with this bullshit...

671
00:43:25,688 --> 00:43:27,106
很好 很高兴你终于说完了!
Good, I'm glad you're done!

672
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:29,525
很高兴你说完了 别再说了
I'm glad you're done. Stay done.

673
00:43:31,527 --> 00:43:34,739
看看你的脸跟酵母菌感染样的!
Look like you got a yeast infection on your goddamn face!

674
00:43:34,822 --> 00:43:36,240
你这个乡下来的狗崽子
You country motherfucker.

675
00:43:55,218 --> 00:43:59,555
- 你能出来吗?  - 也许能吧 我试试
- Can you make it out of there?  - Yeah. I'll make it, I guess.

676
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:01,766
屁股疼
Goddamn ass hurts.

677
00:44:03,643 --> 00:44:05,144
过来 儿子
Come here, son.

678
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:07,271
帮我跨下后挡板
Help me get over this tailgate.

679
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,482
乔 早上我们什么时候过来?
Joe, what time you need us back in the morning?

680
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:11,734
我不需要你们早上过来了
I don't need you back in the morning.

681
00:44:11,818 --> 00:44:13,820
什么叫不需要我们了?
What do you mean, you don't need us back?

682
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:16,072
我们把活都干了 不是吗?
We got the job done, didn't we?

683
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:18,908
孩子 这是你的报酬
That's yours there, son.

684
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,749
我们把活都干了 盖瑞说我们有工作了
We got the job done. Gary said we got the job.

685
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,501
乔 你说什么我都会答应你
Joe, I'll do anything you want.

686
00:44:28,584 --> 00:44:30,503
任何时间地点 你想要让我清理灌木丛
Clear brush, anytime, anywhere.

687
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:31,879
我都可以的
I can do it.

688
00:44:32,255 --> 00:44:34,215
乔 我想要再多干些活
Joe, I'd sure like to work some more.

689
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:35,675
好的 以后再说吧
Yeah, maybe later.

690
00:44:35,758 --> 00:44:37,385
我会通知你的
I'll let you know.

691
00:44:41,764 --> 00:44:45,476
我不知道你做了什么让那个人生气了
I don't know what you did that made that man mad, or something.

692
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,602
你听见了没?
You hear me?

693
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:57,280
你他妈的在看什么?
What the hell are you looking at?

694
00:45:11,127 --> 00:45:12,795
再忍一天吧
Just another day.

695
00:45:15,298 --> 00:45:17,049
这不是他的错
It ain't his fault.

696
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,802
他是爱我们的 只是...
He loves us, it's just...

697
00:45:22,555 --> 00:45:24,891
他正在经历痛苦
He just goes through hard times.

698
00:45:36,569 --> 00:45:40,615
但我是不会坐在一边看着他像打我一样地打你 你听见了吗?
Well, I ain't gonna watch him sit there and hit you like he hits me. You hear me?

699
00:45:40,698 --> 00:45:42,074
妈妈?
Okay, Momma?

700
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:47,872
任何人都不能随随便便地打人
You ain't supposed to do that to no one.

701
00:45:54,503 --> 00:45:56,547
你应该跟家人待在一起
You stay with your family.

702
00:45:59,342 --> 00:46:01,469
这是你该做的
That's what you need to do.

703
00:46:02,011 --> 00:46:04,472
你应该跟家人待在一起
You need to stay with your family.

704
00:46:08,517 --> 00:46:10,519
你的家人是你的所有
Your family's all you got.

705
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:26,535
这是什么?
What was that?

706
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:29,830
我不知道
I don't know.

707
00:46:30,706 --> 00:46:32,625
我没听到有车开过来的声音
Didn't hear no car drive up.

708
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,629
可能不是什么人 没人会出现在这儿
Probably ain't nobody. Ain't nobody with any sense out in this.

709
00:46:38,714 --> 00:46:40,341
喝不出来
Can't taste that.

710
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:46,889
我们今晚出去吗?
We gonna go out tonight?

711
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:49,892
不太想
Not really.

712
00:46:52,937 --> 00:46:54,689
你想去哪?
Where you wanna go?

713
00:46:59,610 --> 00:47:01,070
不知道
I don't know.

714
00:47:02,321 --> 00:47:05,700
我只是想问问我们有没有安排
I was just wondering if we were gonna do something.

715
00:47:08,577 --> 00:47:10,705
你工作得太累了
I think you work too much.

716
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,459
我们应该出去
We should get out.

717
00:47:15,751 --> 00:47:17,420
好好玩玩
Do something fun.

718
00:47:18,087 --> 00:47:20,089
我没有这个打算...
I hadn't planned on it...

719
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:23,092
除非你真的想去
Not unless you want to.

720
00:47:28,639 --> 00:47:30,266
我们也不一定非要出去
We don't have to.

721
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:38,691
有人在外面
There's someone out there.

722
00:47:38,774 --> 00:47:40,276
不 不 等等
No. No, wait.

723
00:47:42,111 --> 00:47:43,446
拿着
Hold this.

724
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:55,875
嗨 乔 你能把那狗牵走吗?
Hey, Joe. Can you put that dog up?

725
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,419
该死 我知道是谁了
Hell. I know who it is.

726
00:48:01,297 --> 00:48:03,632
孩子 你全身都湿了
Boy, you're soaking-ass wet.

727
00:48:03,758 --> 00:48:06,177
你打算怎么办 整夜都站在那?
What'd you plan to do, stand there all night?

728
00:48:06,761 --> 00:48:09,096
他应该把湿衣服脱掉 不然会生病的
He should get out of them wet clothes. He'll get sick.

729
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:10,556
不用 我没事的 我只是...
No, I'm all right. I just...

730
00:48:10,639 --> 00:48:12,933
我只是过来跟你商量 让我再在你那儿干活
I just wanted to come by and talk to you about working some more.

731
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:15,728
干活? 你没看到外面下了那么大的雨吗?
Work? Don't you see what it's doing out there?

732
00:48:16,812 --> 00:48:18,147
看到了 先生
Yes, sir.

733
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:19,732
嘿 我的酒呢?
Hey, where's my drink at?

734
00:48:19,815 --> 00:48:22,401
你有他能穿的裤子吗? 你腰围多大?
You got any trousers he can wear? What size waist you got?

735
00:48:22,485 --> 00:48:25,571
我有些短裤他应该能穿
Well, I think I have some cool pants he can wear.

736
00:48:27,948 --> 00:48:30,576
我敢肯定有了那条狗 没人敢来找麻烦
I bet nobody come messing around here with that dog out there.

737
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:31,994
这也是我买那条狗的原因
Well, that's why I got the dog.

738
00:48:32,078 --> 00:48:34,413
狗才不会管那些路过的人呢
Dog won't bother anybody just walking down the road.

739
00:48:34,497 --> 00:48:37,041
路又不是狗的 狗很讲理的
Road ain't Dog's. Dog knows what's Dog's.

740
00:48:37,124 --> 00:48:40,002
你可以继续走 狗也不会怎样的
You could've just walked on off, Dog wouldn't have done anything.

741
00:48:40,086 --> 00:48:42,296
好吧 给你 试试这个
All right. Here, try these on.

742
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,423
我觉得很适合你
I think they'll fit you.

743
00:48:44,924 --> 00:48:46,342
浴室在这边
Bathroom's this way.

744
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:49,762
它是条好狗
Dog is a good dog.

745
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,890
是啊 但它可吓死我了
Yeah, that dog scared the hell out of me though.

746
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:56,185
他被打得很惨
He's all beat up.

747
00:48:58,187 --> 00:49:00,147
是他爸爸干的 我亲眼看到了
His daddy. I saw him do it.

748
00:49:02,733 --> 00:49:04,026
什么?
You what?

749
00:49:05,069 --> 00:49:09,490
你就在旁边眼睁睁地看着? 还是怎样?
What, you just sat there and watched it? Or what?

750
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:11,909
他是大孩子了...
He's a big kid...

751
00:49:15,204 --> 00:49:18,374
我不能插手每件小事
I can't get my hands dirty in every little thing.

752
00:49:18,582 --> 00:49:20,084
你了解我的
You know how I get.

753
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:21,961
你是大人了 乔
You're a grown man, Joe.

754
00:49:22,044 --> 00:49:23,712
这是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

755
00:49:24,255 --> 00:49:26,674
你想怎么理解都可以
It can mean whatever you want it to mean.

756
00:49:26,841 --> 00:49:29,385
别以为你多了解我
Don't fool yourself too much about me.

757
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:36,684
嘿 不错嘛
Hey, there you go.

758
00:49:36,892 --> 00:49:38,811
看起来帅极了
You look like a million bucks.

759
00:49:38,894 --> 00:49:40,396
现在觉得好些了吗?
You feel better now?

760
00:49:42,231 --> 00:49:43,858
我觉得衰极了
I feel like a hundred bucks.

761
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:48,279
我来是想跟你说说工作的事
I come by 'cause I wanted to talk to you about my job.

762
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:52,741
我想干活 也需要工作
I wanna work and I need a job.

763
00:49:52,825 --> 00:49:55,703
我爸不在乎有没有工作 但我在乎
My daddy don't care if he gots a job, but I do.

764
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:58,455
这大雨天你也会干活的 对吧?
You'd work in this rain, wouldn't you?

765
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:01,750
如果需要的话
If you need me to.

766
00:50:05,462 --> 00:50:08,340
等我穿上鞋 然后送你回家
Let me slip my shoes on, and I'll run you back home.

767
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:17,391
我们马上跟来 好吗?
Hey, we'll be there in just a second, okay?

768
00:50:19,685 --> 00:50:20,895
嘿...
Hey...

769
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:24,690
你不必受别人气的 知道吧?
You know you don't have to take no shit from nobody, right?

770
00:50:25,941 --> 00:50:27,526
你知道的 对吧?
You know that, right?

771
00:50:28,110 --> 00:50:29,445
是 女士
Yes, ma'am.

772
00:50:30,613 --> 00:50:31,739
很好
Good.

773
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,241
那我们走吧
Now, let's go.

774
00:50:36,869 --> 00:50:38,704
- 近来如何 克里斯?  - 挺好 你呢?
- How you been, Chris?  - Good, how about you?

775
00:50:38,787 --> 00:50:41,081
还行 你还在搞综合格斗吗?
Yeah, all right. You still doing the Mixed Martial Arts?

776
00:50:41,165 --> 00:50:42,208
是的
Yes, sir.

777
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:44,501
你大雨天出来干嘛 乔?
What are you doing out in the rain, Joe?

778
00:50:45,461 --> 00:50:49,298
我要买两磅火腿和一磅切片蜂窝奶酪
I need two pounds of ham and a pound of Swiss cheese sliced up.

779
00:50:49,381 --> 00:50:52,051
好的 你来拿奶酪 我拿火腿
All right. Come on, you get the cheese, and I'll get the ham.

780
00:50:52,134 --> 00:50:56,680
- 好  - 好像每次赶上点进度 就又开始下雨了
- Yes, sir.  - Looks like every time I get a little ahead, it starts in raining again.

781
00:51:02,895 --> 00:51:04,313
给你
Here you go.

782
00:51:05,981 --> 00:51:07,816
这些没多少 听我说
It's not much. Now, look here.

783
00:51:08,692 --> 00:51:12,613
等天晴了 你天亮前就一早来这儿
When it dries up, you come down here early in the morning before light,

784
00:51:12,696 --> 00:51:14,573
我来接你 然后送你去干活
and I'll pick you up and take you to work.

785
00:51:14,657 --> 00:51:17,076
天好了 我们有很多活要干
We've got plenty to do when the weather gets right.

786
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:18,661
你有闹钟吗?
You got a clock?

787
00:51:19,036 --> 00:51:20,412
不 你肯定没有
No, you wouldn't. All right.

788
00:51:20,496 --> 00:51:22,748
那我给你找个发条闹钟什么的
I'll find you a wind-up clock or something.

789
00:51:22,873 --> 00:51:24,375
就这样吧
All right, then.

790
00:51:24,541 --> 00:51:25,584
谢谢你 先生
Thank you, sir.

791
00:51:25,668 --> 00:51:27,795
你不用一直叫我先生
You don't need to call me sir all the time.

792
00:51:27,878 --> 00:51:30,172
我是你朋友 懂了吗?
I'm your friend. You understand?

793
00:51:31,882 --> 00:51:33,634
好的 嘿 火腿呢?
All right. Hey, where's his ham?

794
00:51:33,717 --> 00:51:35,970
- 等下 马上好  - 好吧
- Hang on. We're coming.  - All right.

795
00:52:09,044 --> 00:52:11,171
你想什么呢 乔?
What are you thinking, Joe?

796
00:52:14,258 --> 00:52:15,509
什么也没有
Nothing.

797
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:20,597
我讨厌无能为力的感觉
There's nothing I can do and I hate it.

798
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:23,976
不是这样的
That's not true.

799
00:52:25,978 --> 00:52:27,479
就是的
Yeah, it is.

800
00:52:31,275 --> 00:52:33,902
你看着我 好像我应该插手一样
You look at me like I can make a move.

801
00:52:34,611 --> 00:52:38,782
你为什么要那么看着我? 你不在乎吗?
What are you thinking when you look at me like that? Don't you care?

802
00:52:40,409 --> 00:52:42,286
我不知道我是谁
I don't know who I am,

803
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:49,710
我只知道忍耐让我活到了今天
but I know what keeps me alive is restraint.

804
00:52:51,795 --> 00:52:53,589
让我不进监狱
Keeps me out of jail.

805
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,092
让我不伤害别人
Keeps me from hurting people.

806
00:53:04,808 --> 00:53:05,934
嘿
Hey.

807
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:11,482
万事都有原因这扯淡的信仰让我变成这样
A mark of some fucked-up faith that there's a reason.

808
00:53:12,441 --> 00:53:13,525
谢谢你
Thank you.

809
00:53:13,609 --> 00:53:15,611
这一切都有原因
A reason for all of this.

810
00:53:16,779 --> 00:53:20,199
所以大多数时候我不能做我想做的
A reason in most moments I shouldn't do what I wanna do.

811
00:53:23,285 --> 00:53:25,120
而做我该做的
I do as I'm told.

812
00:53:25,913 --> 00:53:28,207
快 装好车 赶紧离开这儿
Come on, let's load up. Let's get outta here.

813
00:53:28,874 --> 00:53:32,086
这些人累死累活地工作
These men who bust their asses work like dogs.

814
00:53:33,295 --> 00:53:37,049
我也信任他们 但他们每天都会受伤
And I believe in them, but every day they hurt.

815
00:53:39,134 --> 00:53:41,470
他们一天天变老 被晒脱皮...
They get old, they peel back...

816
00:53:43,138 --> 00:53:45,307
露易丝的 朱尼尔的
Lewis. Junior.

817
00:53:45,391 --> 00:53:46,934
这里没有战场
There's no frontier anymore.

818
00:53:47,017 --> 00:53:48,227
萨米的
Sammy.

819
00:53:48,477 --> 00:53:49,603
阿兰的
Alan.

820
00:53:50,312 --> 00:53:51,480
克拉克的
Clark.

821
00:53:52,815 --> 00:53:53,941
盖瑞的
Gary.

822
00:53:55,025 --> 00:53:56,819
我看着这孩子
And I watch that boy.

823
00:53:58,404 --> 00:53:59,988
就好像看到了...
I see someone who's...

824
00:54:00,072 --> 00:54:02,074
一个跟我完全不像的人 但是...
who's nothing like me, but...

825
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:04,743
他是个孩子 被人们遗忘了
He's a child, folks left behind.

826
00:54:06,328 --> 00:54:08,205
他冷眼旁观着
And he's on the fence,

827
00:54:09,665 --> 00:54:11,417
不露声色
balanced right there.

828
00:54:15,629 --> 00:54:17,256
你想做什么?
What do you want?

829
00:54:22,511 --> 00:54:24,596
你想要什么?
What is it you want?

830
00:54:26,849 --> 00:54:27,933
没什么
Nothing.

831
00:54:31,395 --> 00:54:33,564
只管告诉我能做什么
Just tell me what I can do.

832
00:54:37,609 --> 00:54:38,986
我喜欢你
I like you.

833
00:54:42,573 --> 00:54:45,075
我也喜欢你 但这有什么意义呢?
I like you, too, but what's the point in any of it?

834
00:54:51,582 --> 00:54:53,417
真他妈操蛋
Fuck to this day.

835
00:54:54,543 --> 00:54:56,795
操他妈的
I mean, fuck to this day.

836
00:55:01,550 --> 00:55:05,387
最终玉石俱焚 物是人非...
It's all just gonna boil up and wash us away...

837
00:55:12,102 --> 00:55:14,229
或许你还会在这儿
Maybe you'll still be here.

838
00:55:19,067 --> 00:55:20,444
或许你不会
Maybe you won't.

839
00:55:31,038 --> 00:55:33,790
该死的 乔 你为什么非让一群人坐这小破卡车呢?
Damn, Joe. Why you keep loading all these fools in this little truck?

840
00:55:33,874 --> 00:55:35,209
有你可真开心啊 萨米
Good to have you with us again, Sammy.

841
00:55:35,292 --> 00:55:37,294
再向下滑一点 我们就得出来推车了
It drop down any lower, we gonna have to get out and push,

842
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:38,378
我绝不会推的
and I ain't pushing shit.

843
00:55:38,462 --> 00:55:40,672
乔 我以为他们会给你一辆新卡车
Joe, I thought they had y'all on a new truck, Joe.

844
00:55:40,756 --> 00:55:42,424
我没有新卡车
I ain't getting no new truck.

845
00:55:42,508 --> 00:55:43,800
那你需要一辆
You need one.

846
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:45,177
不需要的
No, I don't.

847
00:55:45,260 --> 00:55:47,638
乔 如果你买辆新车 这个旧的你卖多少钱?
Joe, if you get a new truck, how much you want for this old one?

848
00:55:47,721 --> 00:55:49,348
你说这个破烂吗?
You mean this old piece of junk?

849
00:55:49,431 --> 00:55:52,351
闻起来跟死过人似的 烂死了
Smells like somebody died up in there. It's nasty.

850
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:55,020
我不介意有味道 我喜欢 我闻着挺好的
I don't mind the smell. I like it. Smells good to me.

851
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:57,314
但这辆车
Yeah, but this thing,

852
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:01,151
修它的时间跟开的时间一样长
I spend as much time working on it as I do driving it.

853
00:56:01,693 --> 00:56:04,196
当然了 它没什么大问题
Of course, there ain't nothing major wrong with it.

854
00:56:04,279 --> 00:56:07,032
只是车嘛 需要休息一下
It's just little shit, you know. It needs some brakes.

855
00:56:07,115 --> 00:56:08,450
需要...
It needs...

856
00:56:09,368 --> 00:56:12,120
乔 拜托啦
Joe. Come on.

857
00:56:12,913 --> 00:56:14,915
我向你买 我会很努力工作
I'll buy it from you, I'll work my butt off.

858
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:17,334
我爱这辆车 你现在就得给我
I love the truck, you have to give it to me now.

859
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:19,086
这个...
Well, I mean, it's...

860
00:56:19,169 --> 00:56:20,837
它都开了好久了
It's got a lot of miles on it.

861
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:23,048
你最好在镇上买一辆
You'd be better finding one in town somewhere.

862
00:56:23,131 --> 00:56:26,051
我不想在镇上买 我喜欢这辆
Well, I don't want one in town. I like that one.

863
00:56:27,010 --> 00:56:28,470
拜托嘛 乔
Come on, Joe.

864
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,642
好吧 那我卖九百块
All right, I'll take $900 for it,

865
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,060
前提是买了新车后
if I get a new truck.

866
00:56:35,143 --> 00:56:37,229
好的! 一言为定
All right! Shake hands.

867
00:56:37,312 --> 00:56:39,648
这才爽快嘛 真棒
That's what I'm talking about. Heck, yeah.

868
00:57:09,845 --> 00:57:11,096
嘿
Hey,

869
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,889
你拿的什么?
what you got there?

870
00:58:46,608 --> 00:58:47,734
你好!
Hey!

871
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:51,780
我想问你能不能告诉我怎么去清水镇
I was wondering if maybe you could tell me how to get down to Water Valley.

872
00:58:52,739 --> 00:58:55,367
我妻子在那里的医院
My wife, she in the hospital down there.

873
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:57,202
我才来的这儿
I just now got here.

874
00:58:58,286 --> 00:59:00,205
你知道有多远吗?
You know how far it is?

875
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:05,794
是走那条公路吗?
Is that the highway that goes to it?

876
00:59:06,628 --> 00:59:07,796
是吗?
Is it?

877
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:10,507
你喝什么呢?
What you drinking?

878
00:59:10,757 --> 00:59:11,967
没什么
Nothing.

879
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:13,969
没什么?
Nothing?

880
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:20,642
你不是在喝酒吧?
You ain't drinking some wine, are you?

881
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:22,811
我...
I...

882
00:59:23,061 --> 00:59:24,354
这没什么不对
Yeah, nothing wrong with that.

883
00:59:24,438 --> 00:59:27,399
有人认为樵夫应该滴酒不沾
Some folks think a feller ought not drink at all,

884
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:30,360
但小酌对人无害啊
but a little drink never hurt nobody.

885
00:59:30,444 --> 00:59:31,903
没错
That's right.

886
00:59:31,987 --> 00:59:35,365
我在家的时候就时不时喝点
I get me a little drink every now and then when I'm down at the house,

887
00:59:35,449 --> 00:59:38,827
但我老伴儿 对此很小题大做
but the old lady, she raises so much sand about it,

888
00:59:39,077 --> 00:59:41,580
我在这儿不怎么喝了
I don't do a lot of drinking down there.

889
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:44,833
一般等到去镇上的时候 比如这会儿
I usually wait until I get uptown like I am now.

890
00:59:44,916 --> 00:59:46,460
买杯酒
Grab me a drink.

891
00:59:49,838 --> 00:59:51,256
她还好吗?
She all right?

892
00:59:51,339 --> 00:59:53,300
是的 今天很好
Well, yeah, she is today.

893
00:59:53,383 --> 00:59:57,220
所以我才来这儿 想去清水镇看看她
That's why I'm trying to get down there to Water Valley, to go see about her.

894
00:59:57,846 --> 01:00:00,056
我今天该拿工钱的
I supposed to get paid today,

895
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:02,684
但那个老家伙 一直没出现
but the old fella, he never showed up.

896
01:00:03,769 --> 01:00:06,897
所以我想着给自己弄点酒
You know, so I think I'll go get me a little drink,

897
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:10,233
去清水镇看看她怎么样了
go down to Water Valley and go see how she's doing.

898
01:00:10,859 --> 01:00:12,903
她在医院里?
She in the hospital?

899
01:00:12,986 --> 01:00:16,364
对 在医院 她得癌症了
Yeah, she in the hospital. She got cancer.

900
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:19,075
慢慢被吞噬 直到死去
Just eat up with it, all over.

901
01:00:19,868 --> 01:00:22,204
可怕的东西...
You know, damn thing...

902
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:25,415
人是一天天活着
You know, a person just don't know from one day to the next

903
01:00:25,499 --> 01:00:27,834
不知道哪天就是最后一日了
which one's gonna be their last.

904
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:35,842
今天天气不错
Hell, it's a beautiful day out, but

905
01:00:36,051 --> 01:00:38,595
但骨头里觉得有点冷
feeling a little chill in my bones.

906
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,847
应该是要下雨了
I think it's fixing to rain.

907
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:43,767
看起来肯定会下雨...
Look like it's fixing to rain some...

908
01:01:19,052 --> 01:01:21,638
恩 这才对...
Yeah. Here we go...

909
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:29,039
三条非洲野犬
Three African painted dogs,

910
01:02:29,456 --> 01:02:34,127
野狗 在动物园杀死了一个三岁孩子
wild dogs, killed a three-year-old in a zoo.

911
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:36,338
学步的孩子...
A toddler...

912
01:02:36,838 --> 01:02:38,840
掉到笼子里 伤到了头
He fell in, hit his head,

913
01:02:39,633 --> 01:02:40,926
被狗抓住了
the dogs got him.

914
01:02:42,802 --> 01:02:44,554
大人们都干嘛去了?
Where was everybody?

915
01:02:57,484 --> 01:02:59,235
他只是个小孩子
He was a little kid.

916
01:03:09,204 --> 01:03:10,455
你好 乔
Hello, Joe.

917
01:03:10,872 --> 01:03:12,374
怎么样啊?
How you doing?

918
01:03:17,337 --> 01:03:18,880
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

919
01:03:20,757 --> 01:03:22,676
给你说 伙计
I tell you what, buddy.

920
01:03:24,427 --> 01:03:27,847
就这么你来我往 恩恩怨怨
All this goddamn back and forth and back and forth.

921
01:03:29,933 --> 01:03:31,726
老子真是受够了
I'm fucking over it.

922
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:34,729
天啊
Hell,

923
01:03:38,316 --> 01:03:39,985
或许我们是时候...
maybe it's time we just...

924
01:03:40,777 --> 01:03:42,028
握手言和了
bygones.

925
01:03:49,244 --> 01:03:51,496
你知道我能要你命的 对吧?
You know I could have killed you, right?

926
01:03:51,579 --> 01:03:53,540
我能要你命 但我没有
I could have killed you, but I didn't.

927
01:03:53,623 --> 01:03:56,626
子弹只是擦身而过 因为我是瞄着树的
I licked you, I was aiming for the trees, see.

928
01:03:57,085 --> 01:03:59,671
那枪只是给你个警告
That shot was meant as a warning shot.

929
01:03:59,754 --> 01:04:01,673
因为你一直在我朋友
'Cause all you keep doing is embarrassing me

930
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,758
面前羞辱我
in front of my goddamn friends.

931
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:09,264
妈的 你上次煽我的时候所有人都在场
I mean, hell, last time you slapped me there was ladies and gentlemen present.

932
01:04:13,893 --> 01:04:17,856
我听说了 给你干活的小孩是怎么回事?
So what's this shit I hear about this kid you got working for you?

933
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:21,443
一个小流浪儿
Little drifter kid,

934
01:04:21,526 --> 01:04:23,069
大概这么高?
about yay big?

935
01:04:25,613 --> 01:04:28,199
我才不关心他呢
I don't really give a shit about him,

936
01:04:28,283 --> 01:04:31,453
但我猜你知道他住哪 对吧

01:15:13,386 --> 01:15:16,138
我要上报一条走失的狗
Well, I'm reporting a lost dog.

1075
01:15:16,472 --> 01:15:18,933

1078
01:15:33,280 --> 01:15:34,990
你在这里做什么?
What are you doing here?

1079
01:15:38,202 --> 01:15:41,580
柯尔曼先生告诉我 你和警察惹了点麻烦
Mr. Coleman told me you got into a little trouble with some cops.

1080
01:15:43,457 --> 01:15:45,084
你听到的就那些?

1081
01:15:47,044 --> 01:15:49,797
他还说你被关进监狱里去了
He said you got put up at that jail, too.

1082
01:15:56,178 --> 01:15:58,389
你不会还想要我的卡车吧 想要吗?

1083
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:03,018

1084
01:16:04,228 --> 01:16:05,438

1085
01:16:11,986 --> 01:16:14,321
他说你有一次进了个大监狱
He said you got put up at the big jail one time.

1086
01:16:15,281 --> 01:16:16,991
柯尔曼告诉你的?
Coleman told you that?

1087
01:16:17,408 --> 01:16:18,576
对
Yeah.

1088
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,828
对 我去过 我...
Yeah, I have. I...

1089
01:16:21,996 --> 01:16:26,167
我因为袭警 在监狱里待了二十九个月
I did 29 months in the penitentiary for assault on a police officer.

1090
01:16:31,005 --> 01:16:34,341
他们逼我把车停在市郊的一个购物中心后面
They pulled me over behind a shopping center uptown.

1091
01:16:35,134 --> 01:16:36,802
有这么一个警官
This one officer,

1092
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,763
长得挺好看的那种
pretty-boy type guy,

1093
01:16:38,846 --> 01:16:40,055
跟我有些过节
had some issue with me.

1094
01:16:40,139 --> 01:16:42,933
以为我和他认识的一个女孩有点关系
Thought I had something to do with one of the girls he knew.

1095
01:16:43,017 --> 01:16:46,103
而我根本就不知道他到底在讲什么
And I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.

1096
01:16:46,854 --> 01:16:48,981
然后在我把他们三个都暴打一顿之后
Then they tried to shoot me,

1097
01:16:49,064 --> 01:16:51,776
他们想向我开枪
after I beat the shit out of all three of them.

1098
01:16:51,859 --> 01:16:53,277
其中一个就这么做了
Or one did.

1099
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:58,324
副警长去拿他的枪 我抢来了
Deputy went for his gun and I grabbed it.

1100
01:17:00,201 --> 01:17:01,285
然后...
And...

1101
01:17:02,870 --> 01:17:06,040
他铁了心要杀我 他是这么告诉我的
Well, he was fixing to kill me, he told me he was.

1102
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,962
他所做的就是把他的膝盖骨给崩了...
All he did was blow his kneecap off...

1103
01:17:13,339 --> 01:17:14,715
那个蠢蛋
The jackass.

1104
01:17:18,010 --> 01:17:19,637
我的狗昨晚跑掉了
My dog run off last night.

1105
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,180
你想去找她吗?
You wanna go look for her?

1106
01:17:22,223 --> 01:17:23,224
好啊
Sure.

1107
01:17:28,187 --> 01:17:31,565
- 你想让我来开这卡车?  - 反正迟早要开始的
- You want me to drive the truck?  - Gotta start sometime.

1108
01:17:31,816 --> 01:17:33,818
别看他们 别向他们挥手
Don't look at them. Don't wave to them.

1109
01:17:33,901 --> 01:17:36,320
他们知道你挥手就意味着你犯了什么罪
Because they know you're guilty of something when you wave.

1110
01:17:36,403 --> 01:17:37,488
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

1111
01:17:37,571 --> 01:17:40,407
对 只要警察想 他就能搞死你
Yeah, a cop can mess you up if he wants to.

1112
01:17:41,283 --> 01:17:42,827
对 我是犯过错
Yeah, I made the mistakes,

1113
01:17:42,910 --> 01:17:46,497
但是他们不肯让我改过自新
but they're the ones that won't ever let me live it down.

1114
01:17:47,581 --> 01:17:49,917
嘿 我能从你这儿买瓶啤酒吗?
Hey, can I buy one of them beers off of you?

1115
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,252
我不知道
I don't know.

1116
01:17:53,170 --> 01:17:57,007
你可以喝一瓶啤酒 但是不能从我这儿买一瓶
You can drink one of these beers, but you cannot buy one from me.

1117
01:17:57,091 --> 01:18:00,219
朋友们从不用从我这儿买东西
Friends don't ever need to buy things from me.

1118
01:18:01,804 --> 01:18:03,931
拿去吧 又冰又爽
There you go, nice and cold.

1119
01:18:04,139 --> 01:18:06,308
睁大你的眼睛
Now, keep your eyes peeled.

1120
01:18:06,392 --> 01:18:08,352
看警察还是看狗?
For the cops or the dog?

1121
01:18:08,936 --> 01:18:10,145
都要...
Both...

1122
01:18:13,023 --> 01:18:14,650
警察还是狗
Cops or the dogs.

1123
01:18:15,067 --> 01:18:16,527
你听到了吗?
You hear that?

1124
01:18:16,902 --> 01:18:19,530
这种声音能让妓女激动起来
That's the sound that gets the hookers excited.

1125
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:22,283
她们知道你有钱 她们听到这个...
They know you got cash. They hear that...

1126
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:31,458
你想学学怎么做个冷酷的表情吗?
You wanna learn how to make a cool face?

1127
01:18:31,542 --> 01:18:33,085
好 解剖一下冷酷的表情
All right. Anatomy of a cool face.

1128
01:18:33,168 --> 01:18:34,962
做一个痛苦的表情...
Make a face of pain...

1129
01:18:35,713 --> 01:18:37,047
现在笑一个
Now smile.

1130
01:18:37,506 --> 01:18:39,300
不是 是在痛苦上接着笑
No, smile on top of the pain.

1131
01:18:39,383 --> 01:18:41,719
保留痛苦的表情 痛着笑
Hold the pain. Smile through it.

1132
01:18:41,969 --> 01:18:43,554
你没醉吧?
You ain't drunk, are you?

1133
01:18:43,637 --> 01:18:45,514
该死 最好我来开车
Shit, I'd better drive.

1134
01:18:45,931 --> 01:18:48,183
你知道吗 盖瑞? 你可以做到的
You know what, Gary? You got it made.

1135
01:18:48,267 --> 01:18:51,312
想想你将会上的好多美女
Because think about all the beautiful girls you're gonna fuck.

1136
01:18:51,395 --> 01:18:54,398
我以前认识一个住在这附近的女孩
I used to know a girl that lived around here.

1137
01:18:54,481 --> 01:18:56,233
该死的 我的狗在哪里?
Shit, where's my dog?

1138
01:18:56,317 --> 01:18:57,902
我把它从小养大的
I raised that dog from a pup.

1139
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:03,032
- 菲丝!  - 这儿有好多施工场地
- Faith!  - There's lots of construction here,

1140
01:19:03,115 --> 01:19:04,909
因为他们在造一个印度寺庙
because they're building a Hindu temple.

1141
01:19:04,992 --> 01:19:08,287
会有很多邦巴小孩

他们头中心有小红点
Little red dots in the center of their head,

1143
01:19:11,290 --> 01:19:12,791
像激光束一样

1144
01:19:12,875 --> 01:19:14,084

Faith!

你最好多练练冷酷的表情
You better work on that cool face.

1146

你得站得像是你是地主一样 好吗?
You gotta stand like you own land, right?

1147
01:19:19,173 --> 01:19:21,675
现在 做个痛苦的表情 好吗?
Now, you make the pain face, right?

1148
01:19:22,051 --> 01:19:24,053
你脑子里有好多东西

01:19:28,557 --> 01:19:31,685
"我脑子里有好多事 但是我能做到 我能完成的"
"I got a lot on my mind, but I can do it. I can get through it."

1152
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:33,354
对 你找到门道了嘛 你做到了

Yes, ma'am, I meant to get around to doing that,

1158
01:19:54,917 --> 01:19:57,169
但是我还没把我的狗照顾到底
but I did a halfway job on my dog.

1159
01:19:57,252 --> 01:19:58,587
没照顾到底?
A halfway job?

1160
01:19:58,671 --> 01:20:01,298
- 没到底 女士  - 那么 怎么没到底?

Well now, I'm a pretty long way from crazy.

你有只看起来像奶牛的狗?
You have a dog that look like a cow?

Well, it's not that big a deal. A lot of dogs look like cows.

1172
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:26,073

我觉得狗会在那里

不 狗会跑走的
No, the dog run off.

1180
01:20:40,713 --> 01:20:43,424
如果我是狗 那就是狗会待的地方

1206
01:22:41,208 --> 01:22:42,543

1210
01:22:57,975 --> 01:22:59,852
我要把这个带去听歌剧
I'll take this one to the opera.

1211
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:01,687
去听歌剧 好啊
To the opera, yeah.

1212
01:23:09,987 --> 01:23:12,406
该死的 我没打火机了
Shit, I don't have a lighter.

1213
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:16,910
昨天的数据显示
The numbers from yesterday,

1214
01:23:16,994 --> 01:23:19,705
官方说的最高温是九十二度
we had a high of 92, officially,

1215
01:23:19,788 --> 01:23:23,750
比平均温度九十度高了两度
that's two degrees above the average of 90 for the day.

1216
01:23:23,834 --> 01:23:25,169
最低温度六十八度...
68 was our low...

1217
01:23:40,434 --> 01:23:42,019
你有打火机吗?
You got a light?

1218
01:23:42,477 --> 01:23:44,396
- 有  - 上车
- Yeah.  - Hop in.

1219
01:24:03,165 --> 01:24:04,750
那个男孩是个好工人
That boy's a good worker.

1220
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,464
那是我这辈子做过的最努力的工作了
That's the hardest fucking work I ever done in my life.

1221
01:24:11,048 --> 01:24:12,799
- 那是吗?  - 是啊
- Is it?  - Yeah.

1222
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:15,594
- 你付我儿子钱吗?  -什么?
- You paying my boy?  - What?

1223
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:17,971
- 你付我儿子钱吗?  - 该死 对!
- Are you paying my boy?  - Hell, yeah!

1224
01:24:18,597 --> 01:24:20,557
我没见他拿过钱
I ain't seen he got paid none.

1225
01:24:20,641 --> 01:24:22,768
说不定他很聪明 存起来了
Well, he probably saves it 'cause he's smart.

1226
01:24:22,851 --> 01:24:24,645
从我这儿买了这辆车
Buying this GMC off of me.

1227
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:26,605
买了啥?
Doing what?

1228
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:29,274
- 没什么  - 好
- Nothing.  - Yeah.

1229
01:24:30,525 --> 01:24:32,194
他没那么聪明
He ain't so smart.

1230
01:24:32,569 --> 01:24:33,946
他什么都不懂
He don't know nothing.

1231
01:24:35,405 --> 01:24:37,241
你也不懂
Hell, neither do you.

1232
01:24:41,620 --> 01:24:43,830
我跟你直说吧
I'm gonna shoot you straight.

1233
01:24:48,293 --> 01:24:50,295
那孩子干的很辛苦!
That boy works his ass off!

1234
01:24:51,338 --> 01:24:52,923
他挣的钱
He's earned money,

1235
01:24:53,006 --> 01:24:54,508
是他自己的!
and it's his!

1236
01:24:55,592 --> 01:24:57,219
如果这车是垃圾的话
If this truck's a piece of shit,

1237
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:59,096
你就滚下去吧
then you need to get out of it.

1238
01:24:59,179 --> 01:25:02,140
如果我发现那孩子又受谁欺负的话
And if I find out something has happened to that boy,

1239
01:25:02,349 --> 01:25:05,519
我会给那人点儿颜色看看
I'm gonna whip whoever's ass had something to do with it.

1240
01:25:06,395 --> 01:25:08,105
在我把你打得满地找牙之前
Now get the hell away from me,

1241
01:25:08,188 --> 01:25:11,316
最好给我滚远点
before I knock what's left of your fucking teeth out.

1242
01:25:35,757 --> 01:25:38,176
我今天有个很可笑的想法
I had the funniest thought today.

1243
01:25:43,515 --> 01:25:47,853
我想咱俩可以出去吃个晚餐
I thought maybe you and I could go out to dinner.

1244
01:25:51,982 --> 01:25:53,275
懂吗?
You know?

1245
01:25:54,318 --> 01:25:56,069
穿得正式点
Get all dressed up.

1246
01:25:59,489 --> 01:26:03,994
你还可以为我开门
And maybe you could hold the door open for me.

1247
01:26:14,421 --> 01:26:16,423
那样多好
I think that would be nice.

1248
01:26:22,763 --> 01:26:24,765
虽然你在装睡
You pretend to be asleep,

1249
01:26:27,392 --> 01:26:30,312
但我知道 我说错了话你还会哭
but I know you'd cry if I said the wrong thing.

1250
01:26:56,505 --> 01:26:58,590
你知道这地方很危险 对吗?
You know this place is condemned, right?

1251
01:26:59,383 --> 01:27:03,220
不是每个房子随便把窗户上木板拆下来 就可以住人的
You can't just take boards off windows and call a place home.

1252
01:27:07,474 --> 01:27:09,893
盖瑞 你为什么还留在这?
Gary, why do you stick around like this?

1253
01:27:11,144 --> 01:27:14,231
你已经够成熟 够聪明了 你可以做自己想做的了
You're old enough, smart enough, to do your own thing.

1254
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:18,193
现在最重要的
What's most important right now is me

1255
01:27:18,276 --> 01:27:20,320
是照顾多萝西和妈妈
taking care of Dorothy and Momma,

1256
01:27:20,404 --> 01:27:24,825
因为我们现在有点家庭纠纷
'cause we kinda gota family problem right now.

1257
01:27:30,414 --> 01:27:31,498
嘿
Hey, there.

1258
01:27:32,165 --> 01:27:33,208
嘿...
Hey, now...

1259
01:27:35,293 --> 01:27:37,045
她不怎么说话?
Don't talk much, does she?

1260
01:27:38,213 --> 01:27:39,548
她根本不说
She don't talk at all.

1261
01:27:39,631 --> 01:27:40,882
你什么意思?
What do you mean?

1262
01:27:41,258 --> 01:27:44,094
不知道 没人知道 某一天她就突然不说了
I don't know. Nobody knows. She just stopped one day.

1263
01:27:44,177 --> 01:27:46,012
我是说她原来会说 但...
I mean she used to would, but...

1264
01:27:54,896 --> 01:27:57,524
嘿 如果你准备好的话 我们去交易吧
Well, hey, I'm ready to make this deal if you are.

1265
01:27:58,108 --> 01:27:59,317
好的
Yeah.

1266
01:27:59,401 --> 01:28:00,944
我去拿钱
I'll grab my money.

1267
01:28:01,820 --> 01:28:02,988
嘿! 老家伙
Hey! G-Daawg.

1268
01:28:06,658 --> 01:28:09,286
别以为我忘了 伙计
Don't you think I forgot about it, bud.

1269
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:13,373
我一直在找你和那孩子
I've been looking for you and that kid.

1270
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:16,334
你那个儿子
That boy of yours,

1271
01:28:16,877 --> 01:28:19,212
他肯定以为他明白很多
he sure thinks he knows something.

1272
01:28:19,880 --> 01:28:21,465
我认识你 先生
I know you, mister.

1273
01:28:21,548 --> 01:28:23,049
你是我朋友吗?
You my friend?

1274
01:28:24,593 --> 01:28:26,386
不是
I ain't your friend.

1275
01:28:26,845 --> 01:28:29,764
你喜欢做那些鬼脸
Well, you like to make all them funny faces.

1276
01:28:29,973 --> 01:28:31,349
我说 你是我朋友吗?
I said, are you my friend?

1277
01:28:31,433 --> 01:28:33,185
听着 伙计
Listen, buddy.

1278
01:28:34,895 --> 01:28:38,315
我知道怎么让咱俩成为朋友
I think I know a way that you and me can be friends.

1279
01:28:46,239 --> 01:28:48,074
在这儿呢
There it is.

1280
01:28:51,369 --> 01:28:55,165
看起来很像原来的那辆 长春花蓝 我挺喜欢
It looks just like your old one. Periwinkle blue. I like it.

1281
01:28:55,749 --> 01:28:57,417
希望如此
I hope so.

1282
01:28:59,044 --> 01:29:01,671
汽油应该足够你开回家了
Now, you got plenty of gas to get home.

1283
01:29:01,755 --> 01:29:03,381
如果你想四周转转的话
You might want to stop at Coleman's

1284
01:29:03,465 --> 01:29:06,510
去柯尔曼那儿再加点油
and put a little more in it if you plan to ride around.

1285
01:29:06,593 --> 01:29:07,886
这个给你
Here.

1286
01:29:07,969 --> 01:29:10,013
- 那是什么?  - 买车的钱
- What's that?  - It's money for the truck.

1287
01:29:10,096 --> 01:29:11,556

Hell. I ain't worried about that.

1288
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:15,519
你拿着吧 交保险的时候用得到
You just stick it back in your pocket. You're gonna need it for insurance.

1289
01:29:15,977 --> 01:29:17,938
- 交保险干什么?  - 是法律规定的
- What's the insurance?  - Well, yeah, it's a law.

1290
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:20,023
没有保险就不能开车
You can't drive without insurance.

1291
01:29:20,106 --> 01:29:23,360
现在还有保险 但我把车签给你之后 你就要自己付钱了
You're covered now, but when I sign it over, you gotta pick up the insurance.

1292
01:29:23,443 --> 01:29:25,487
过两天你来我家
I'll tell you what, you come out to the house before long,

1293
01:29:25,570 --> 01:29:26,905
我帮你搞定
we'll get you fixed up.

1294
01:29:26,988 --> 01:29:28,615
我要走了 你没问题吧?

1295
01:29:28,698 --> 01:29:30,450
- 没问题 先生  - 好的
- Yes, sir.  - All right.

1296
01:29:32,536 --> 01:29:34,037
你想让我跟着你吗?
You want me to follow you?

1297
01:29:34,120 --> 01:29:35,622
不用 没关系的
No, I'll be all right.

1298
01:29:37,791 --> 01:29:39,042

1301
01:31:08,715 --> 01:31:10,508

1302
01:31:10,592 --> 01:31:11,718
对
Yeah.

1303
01:31:11,885 --> 01:31:13,386
你可以对着这个吹一口气吗?
You wanna breathe into this for me?

1304
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:15,013
不 我不想
No, I don't want to breathe into that.

1305
01:31:15,096 --> 01:31:16,806

- Stay in your vehicle!  - I ain't drunk.

You better look for someone else to mess with, 'cause I did nothing!

1311
01:32:12,612 --> 01:32:14,864
- 把手放到身后  - 你和你的狗屁朋友
- Put your hands behind your back.  - You and your motherfucking friends

1312
01:32:14,948 --> 01:32:16,366
再找我麻烦 我要弄死你...

1313
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:17,617

过来!
Come here!

1315
01:32:21,371 --> 01:32:22,455
我猜如果我现在开走
I guess if I drive off now,

1316
01:32:22,539 --> 01:32:24,791
你就要把猎枪拿出来 开枪打我了?
you're gonna get your shotgun out of the back and shoot me?

1317
01:32:24,874 --> 01:32:26,084
- 不会  - 你要开枪吗?
- No.  - You gonna shoot me?

1318
01:32:26,167 --> 01:32:27,293
- 不要  - 你可以开

1320
01:33:09,252 --> 01:33:11,171
你那只疯狗还在吗?
Still got that badass dog?

1321
01:33:11,838 --> 01:33:13,923
在呢 在这儿呢
Yeah, around here somewhere.

1322
01:33:14,007 --> 01:33:15,383

Hold on a minute.

1323
01:33:16,134 --> 01:33:17,552

1332
01:33:40,366 --> 01:33:43,203
说他长得跟你希望的一样

1333
01:33:46,372 --> 01:33:47,749
她说他眼睛长得像你
She said he's got your eyes.

1334

他要去干哪行? 执法?
What's he going into? Law enforcement?

1338
01:33:59,761 --> 01:34:01,554
我听说是
That's what I heard.

1339
01:34:02,931 --> 01:34:05,892
你雇了一个新人干活 是吗?
You got a new man working for you now, don't you?

01:34:07,894 --> 01:34:09,562
我想你已经见过了
I believe you've met him.

1342
01:34:09,646 --> 01:34:11,815
卖力的家伙 有点太热情了
Gung ho fella, a little over-eager.

1343
01:34:11,898 --> 01:34:14,025
他在找人约炮呢
He was looking for someone to fuck with.

1344
01:34:14,108 --> 01:34:15,944
有可能
Yeah, maybe so.

1345
01:34:16,027 --> 01:34:20,698
我要让他去干点活 冷静点
I'll have his ass shuffling papers for a while until he learns to cool down a little bit.

1346
01:34:21,241 --> 01:34:23,368
但我担心的不是这个
But that ain't what I'm worried about.

1347
01:34:24,869 --> 01:34:26,955
能递给我辣酱吗?
Will you pass the hot sauce?

1348
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:33,753
我来问你个问题 乔 因为我真的很想知道
Let me ask you a question, Joe, 'cause I really want to know.

1349
01:34:34,629 --> 01:34:36,422
你为什么想回到过去呢?
Why you wanna go back?

1350
01:34:36,756 --> 01:34:39,926
你为什么想回到监禁所呢?
Why you wanna go back to the damn penitentiary, man?

1351
01:34:44,889 --> 01:34:47,392
你不能总是去别人家里
Because you can't keep going to folks' houses,

1352
01:34:47,475 --> 01:34:50,436
什么也不管 就把别人的狗弄死
killing their dogs, don't matter what else is going on.

1353
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:52,939
你也不能一直跟法律抗争
And you can't keep fist-fighting the law.

1354
01:34:53,940 --> 01:34:57,151
法官不会容忍的 他不用容忍
Judge won't put up with it. He don't have to put up with it.

1355
01:34:57,235 --> 01:34:59,487
所以他们才建了监狱
That's why they build prisons.

1356
01:35:05,285 --> 01:35:07,537
你又让我重新吸烟了 该死
Now you done got me back to smoking, damn it.

1357
01:35:07,620 --> 01:35:09,789
我都戒了三个星期了
I been quit for three weeks.

1358
01:35:12,792 --> 01:35:15,003
我对你不薄 乔
I haven't mistreated you, Joe.

1359
01:35:15,545 --> 01:35:18,131
不是吗? 说实话
Have I? Tell the truth.

1360
01:35:18,673 --> 01:35:19,966
是 厄尔
No, Earl.

1361
01:35:20,174 --> 01:35:22,343
你在可能的时候都替我说话
You stuck up for me when you could.

1362
01:35:23,011 --> 01:35:25,305
我以前情况跟你一样糟
And I used to be as bad as you.

1363
01:35:26,222 --> 01:35:29,225
有段时间比我还糟
At one time, you were worse.

1364
01:35:31,477 --> 01:35:34,147
对 但我现在很好
Yeah, but I'm cool now.

1365
01:35:45,533 --> 01:35:47,619
柯妮 你去哪了 宝贝?
Connie. Where'd you go, baby?

1366
01:35:50,496 --> 01:35:52,498
下次记得接电话
Answer the phone next time.

1367
01:36:25,896 --> 01:36:28,000
我感觉乔在这里
Yo presiento que Joe está aquí.

1368
01:36:29,285 --> 01:36:31,704
乔 是你吗? 你在吗?
Joe, is it you? Estás aquí?

1369
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:55,561
对 是我
Yeah, it's me.

1370
01:37:16,874 --> 01:37:17,959
该死
Shit.

1371
01:37:19,085 --> 01:37:20,253
出了什么事?
What happened?

1372
01:37:20,336 --> 01:37:22,255
我需要借车
I need to borrow the truck.

1373
01:37:22,839 --> 01:37:24,632
你怎么了?
What happened to you?

1374
01:37:25,216 --> 01:37:26,551
我要杀了他
I'm gonna kill him.

1375
01:37:27,135 --> 01:37:29,387
我要杀了那个老混蛋
I'm gonna kill that old son of a bitch.

1376
01:37:29,470 --> 01:37:31,681
别以为我不会 我会做的
You think I won't, but I will.

1377
01:37:33,850 --> 01:37:35,977
我要把我的钱拿回来
And I'm gonna get mine back.

1378
01:37:37,812 --> 01:37:39,439
我就需要借那车用
I just need to borrow that truck.

1379
01:37:39,522 --> 01:37:40,857
进来
Come inside.

1380
01:37:42,108 --> 01:37:43,484
过来
Come here.

1381
01:37:50,616 --> 01:37:52,118
别碰我
Don't touch me.

1382
01:37:52,285 --> 01:37:54,120
我该教你拳击的
I should've given you a boxing lesson.

1383
01:37:54,203 --> 01:37:56,706
我不需要 我知道该怎么做
I don't need no goddamn boxing lesson. I know what to do.

1384
01:37:56,789 --> 01:37:58,958
我要向他眼睛打一拳
I'll pop him right in the eye.

1385
01:38:00,626 --> 01:38:03,504
他打了我 把我扔出了卡车
He whooped my ass and threw me out the truck.

1386
01:38:03,838 --> 01:38:05,840
因为他知道我要杀了他
Because he knew that I was gonna kill him.

1387
01:38:09,761 --> 01:38:11,471
我能杀他
I could kill his ass.

1388
01:38:12,138 --> 01:38:14,432
我能像你那样干脆地杀了他
I could kill him just as good as you could.

1389
01:38:15,266 --> 01:38:17,643
我知道你能 我知道你能
I know you could. I know you could.

1390
01:38:17,727 --> 01:38:19,062
我知道
I know it.

1391
01:38:19,187 --> 01:38:21,355
但你不必这么做
But you don't have to do that.

1392
01:38:22,023 --> 01:38:23,357
孩子
Okay, son.

1393
01:38:24,108 --> 01:38:25,985
跟我待在这
Just stay here with me.

1394
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:28,696
你会很安全的
You'll be safe here.

1395
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,200
我把你妈妈和姐姐带回来
I'll bring your Momma and your sister.

1396
01:38:32,283 --> 01:38:33,910
他抓了多萝西
He's got Dorothy.

1397
01:38:35,661 --> 01:38:37,538
他带她跑了
He done ran off with her.

1398
01:38:37,622 --> 01:38:39,040
他跟一些坏人见了面
He met up with some bad men.

1399
01:38:39,123 --> 01:38:41,167
我听见他说了
I heard him talking about it.

1400
01:38:42,168 --> 01:38:44,087
脸上有疤的那个男人
That man with the scarred-up face,

1401
01:38:44,170 --> 01:38:46,839
我在桥上殴打的那个
the one that I beat down by the bridge.

1402
01:38:49,383 --> 01:38:52,303
他一直想报复我
He's been looking for me for what I done did to him.

1403
01:38:53,012 --> 01:38:55,181
她没伤害任何人 乔
She didn't hurt nobody, Joe.

1404
01:38:56,265 --> 01:38:58,184
应该是我受惩罚的
It should have been me.

1405
01:39:03,356 --> 01:39:05,691
你知道她被带到哪里了吗?
Do you know where they took her?

1406
01:39:08,528 --> 01:39:09,654
盖瑞

我要去一个地方
To get me some place.

1411
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:36,347
我要大干一场
I'm gonna make trouble.

1412
01:39:43,813 --> 01:39:45,398

如果我出事了 你要离开 明白吗?
If anything happens to me, you get your ass outta the way. You hear?

你开着我的车走
You take my truck and get out.

1423

1424

No,no,no!

1428
01:43:00,926 --> 01:43:02,595
- 不许动  - 该死
- Don't move.  - God damn it.

1429
01:43:02,678 --> 01:43:04,180
要是动的话 我把你们俩都杀了
I'll kill you both if you move.

1430
01:43:04,263 --> 01:43:06,807
乔 听我说 这... 这不是看起来那么回事
Joe, listen to me. This... It ain't what it looks like, man.

1431
01:43:06,891 --> 01:43:08,017
真的
I'm telling you.

1432
01:43:08,100 --> 01:43:10,102
多萝西! 多萝西!
Dorothy! Dorothy!

1433
01:43:10,186 --> 01:43:11,854
把她带走 盖瑞
Get her out, Gary.

1434
01:43:11,937 --> 01:43:13,773
带着妹妹离开这里
Take your sister and go.

1435
01:43:13,856 --> 01:43:15,107
快 快啊!
Go. Go!

1436
01:43:16,442 --> 01:43:18,444
我不认识你

- 在我开枪打你之前快跑  - 不 不 不
- Run, before I shoot you.  - No, no, no, no, no.

1438

1439
01:43:27,453 --> 01:43:28,537
盖瑞!
Gary!

1440
01:43:29,246 --> 01:43:30,331

01:43:32,333 --> 01:43:34,293
- 盖瑞!  - 我去叫人帮忙 乔
- Gary!  - I'll get help, Joe.

1442
01:43:42,468 --> 01:43:45,096
天啊 那女孩 她不...
God damn it. And that girl, she don't...

1443
01:43:46,514 --> 01:43:48,099
他妈的她什么都不懂
She don't know shit about shit, man.

1444
01:43:48,182 --> 01:43:50,518
跟她爹一样 她就是一垃圾
She's just a piece of trash just like her daddy.

1445
01:43:50,601 --> 01:43:53,562
过不久她就会做这烂事的 我告诉你
And she's gonna be doing this shit in no time, I'm telling you.

1446
01:43:53,646 --> 01:43:54,897
真的 伙计
I'm telling you, man.

1447
01:43:54,980 --> 01:43:56,649
看着月亮
Look at the moon.

1448
01:44:18,212 --> 01:44:19,296
该死的!
God damn it!

1449
01:44:24,510 --> 01:44:26,137
去你妈的
Fuck this shit.

1450
01:44:28,055 --> 01:44:30,307
如果你想开枪打我 来啊 开枪吧
If you want to shoot me, go ahead and shoot me.

1451
01:44:30,391 --> 01:44:33,060
我穿过了挡风玻璃 我他妈的无所谓...
I went through a windshield and I don't give a...

1452
01:45:51,388 --> 01:45:53,349
你是我的朋友吗?
Are you my friend?

1453
01:47:47,838 --> 01:47:50,090
你都做了什么 乔?
What have you done, Joe?

1454
01:50:15,110 --> 01:50:16,528
我们是这样运作的
Here's what we do.

1455
01:50:17,196 --> 01:50:21,366
我们晚点开始 从早上八点干到下午四点
We start a little late, around 8:00 in the morning, and we go until 4:00.

1456
01:50:21,450 --> 01:50:24,870
我每周五按周结算工钱 有时候我们干的时间长一点
I pay by the week, on Fridays. Some days we go long.

1457
01:50:24,953 --> 01:50:28,624
如果每周超过四十个小时 我多付半倍的工资
If we run past 40 hours a week, I pay time and a half.

1458
01:50:29,291 --> 01:50:30,542
是件苦差事
It's hard work.

1459
01:50:31,210 --> 01:50:33,253
我不喜欢太多人聚集在一起
I don't like a whole lot of standing around.

1460
01:50:33,337 --> 01:50:37,633
我们卖力点做 到四月底就可以分散一点
We'll probably bust our ass and get this spread out by the end of April.

1461
01:50:37,716 --> 01:50:39,802
把所有幼苗都种上
Get out all the bare root seedlings.

1462
01:50:39,885 --> 01:50:43,263
有时候为了保持矮小幼苗的稳定 用木棍支撑一下
Sometimes, we stake them if we got to keep the little ones stable.

1463
01:50:43,347 --> 01:50:48,143
大部分时间我们还是让他们自由生长
Most of the time we don't need to mess with them little pine seedlings like that.

1464
01:50:48,227 --> 01:50:52,481
我要你去加入在农场西边唐·L的队伍
I'm gonna have you join Don L. and his crew on the west end of the farm.

1465
01:50:52,564 --> 01:50:54,858
如果那一片进行顺利的话
Then if everything goes good on that acreage,

1466
01:50:54,942 --> 01:50:59,279
到了夏天我会让你帮我监督在马尼亚的项目
I'll have you help me supervise the Manea project next summer.

1467
01:50:59,696 --> 01:51:02,699
有时候 老混蛋的钱很不好赚
Old bastards can be hard to work for sometimes.

1468
01:51:03,367 --> 01:51:05,661
不过 既然你原来给乔干活
But hell, if you worked for Joe,

1469
01:51:06,578 --> 01:51:08,580
我觉得你会干好的
I think you'll do just fine.

1470
01:51:09,289 --> 01:51:10,833
你有问题吗?
You got any questions?

1471
01:51:10,916 --> 01:51:12,668
没有 先生 我什么时候开始?
No, sir. When can I start?

1472
01:51:12,751 --> 01:51:14,294
如果你准备好了 现在就开始吧
Right now, if you're ready.

1473
01:51:14,378 --> 01:51:15,671
好的 先生
Yes, sir.

1474
01:51:17,673 --> 01:51:19,216
你认识乔?
So you knew Joe?

1475
01:51:19,299 --> 01:51:20,509
当然
Yeah, sure did.

1476
01:51:20,592 --> 01:51:22,261
乔是个好人
Joe's a good man.

1477
01:51:22,678 --> 01:51:24,596
反正对我来说是
Good man to me anyways.

1478
01:51:26,265 --> 01:51:27,391
对我也是
Good man to me too.
