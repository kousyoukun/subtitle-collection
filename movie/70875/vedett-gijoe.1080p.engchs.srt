国家未来

我可不是那种坐视不管的人
I'm not going to be the man
who waited and saw.

00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,551
这是一个有趣的选择了一个笑话。
That's an interesting choice of a joke.

269
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,174
你可以说所有的事情...
Of all the things you could say...

270
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,593
 - “你爱我的内裤”？
 - 是你要去闭嘴？
-"You love my panties"?
- Are you gonna shut up?

271
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,799
 - 那是什么意思？
 - 你会闭嘴吗？
- What does that mean?
- You gonna shut up?

272
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,851
 - 我在寻找你。
 - 我试图做一些事情。
- I'm looking out for you.
- I'm trying to do something.

273
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:39,770
我只是不...
 - 闭嘴，闭嘴。
-I just don't...
- Shut up, just shut up.

274
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,353
 - 我只是说。
 - 闭嘴。
- I'm just saying.
- Just shut up.

275
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:48,688
你的心率怎么样？
How's your heart rate?

276
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:50,694
这是不是要去计数。
That is not gonna count.

277
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,616
我现在能去，因为你再次谈到。
I get to go again because you talked.

278
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,946
你拉到一个触发器。
现在，我拉一个触发器。
You pulled a trigger.
Now I pull a trigger.

279
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,242
不，我们不这样做。
No, we're not doing that.

280
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,497
 - 那是不是要去计数。
-- That is not gonna count.

281
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,794
骗子。
Cheater.

282
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,800
我买了我的小女孩
卡拉OK机
I bought my little girls
a karaoke machine

283
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:13,091
他们喜欢唱歌就可以了，
通宵达旦。
and they love singing on it,
all night long.

284
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:16,265
有没有睡前宵禁，
所以他们要去会整夜。
There's no bedtime curfew,
so they're going to be up all night.

285
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,637
确保你把你的耳塞。
Make sure you bring your earplugs.

286
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,310
轰！
Boom!

287
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,229
 - 回来 三局两胜 - 没门。
- C'mon, best two out of three.
- No.

288
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,430
三局两胜。这没算。
Best two out of three. That didn't count.

289
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,016
你没告诉我
关于卡拉OK机。
You didn't tell me
about the karaoke machine.

290
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,289
Zandar。
Zandar.

291
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,991
总统先生。
Mr President.

292
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:54,758
难道你不应该阻止人们
用枪射杀我的爸爸？
Aren't you supposed to stop people
from shooting my dad?

293
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,464
秃子。
Baldy.

294
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,923
白痴。
Idiot.

295
00:20:58,007 --> 00:20:59,680
够挖出来，李·哈维。
Enough out of you, Lee Harvey.

296
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:03,601
清理的巧克力渍
你离开你母亲的卧室。
Go clean up the chocolate stains
you left in your mother's bedroom.

297
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,359
小鹰喜欢刮伤。
Kitty likes to scratch.

298
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:11,570
接下来的时间，
Next time,

299
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,697
拿出他的肥屁股。
take out his fat ass.

300
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,782
这将是我的荣幸，先生。
It would be my pleasure, sir.

301
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:31,131
我给你带来了一些消息。
I brought you some news.

302
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,680
特种部队就要被清理出视线以外了
The G.I. Joes are about to be
out of the picture.

303
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:43,766
我所说的被清理 意思就是
And by "out of the picture," I mean

304
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:46,681
从地球上消失
alive on earth.

305
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,278
因为他们爬得实在太高了
Got a little too close to Mount Olympus.

306
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,395
咦？
Huh?

307
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,697
该把他们打下来了
Had to strike them down.

308
00:21:59,693 --> 00:22:01,195
他们揭穿到你，Zartan。
They'll find you out, Zartan.

309
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:03,906
不，我不这么认为。
No. No, I don't think so.

310
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,701
纳米技术的厉害就在于
That's the beauty of nanomites.

311
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:09,624
在这里，一起来看看。
Here, take a look.

312
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:10,746
嗯？
Hmm?

313
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,810
完美无瑕的显微技术。
Flawless microtechnology.

314
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:26,478
你疯了。
You're insane.

315
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,935
课间休息过。他坐了下来。
Recess over. Sit him down.

316
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,441
你知道，他们说
这是一个吃力不讨好的工作。
You know, they say
this is a thankless job.

317
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:38,278
但我在昨天还和歌手出去玩了
But yesterday I hung out with Bono.

318
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,281
我的新特勤局
My new Secret Service,

319
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,283
他们想烧宪法。
they want to burn the Constitution.

320
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,829
从字面上看。
Literally.

321
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:47,954
我的实习生...
And my interns...

322
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,629
哦，是啊，我带回来的实习生。
Oh, yeah, I brought back the interns.

323
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,794
嗯，嗯。
Mmm-mmm.

324
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,795
你知道我最喜欢的一点？
我吹的东西了。
Do you know my favourite bit?
I get to blow stuff up.

325
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,719
哦，我敢打赌，喜欢上你的人。
Oh, I bet that endears you to the people.

326
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,220
嗯，这是的东西。
Well, that's the thing.

327
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,803
你的支持率
爬上9分。
Your approval ratings
climbed nine points.

328
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:10,557
看来美国人喜欢的是你的长相
Apparently, America wants
someone who looks like you,

329
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,232
但行为像我一样。
but acts like me.

330
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,983
我做事从不拖泥带水，宝贝。
I'm the quicker blower-upper, baby.

331
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,564
但有一点不满意
Only one drawback.

332
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,906
你那位亲爱的夫人
The little wifey-pooh?  Huh?

333
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,536
如果你碰我的家人...
If you touch my family...

334
00:23:25,487 --> 00:23:27,239
我唬弄你。
I'm yanking your chain.

335
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,663
你都做到第二任了，
Two long terms of you,

336
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,665
我只是一个短短的几个月。
just a few short months of me.

337
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,256
所以我们不要浪费时间。
So let's not waste the time I got left.

338
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,756
告诉我监狱在哪儿
眼镜蛇指挥官和Destro关哪儿？
Where is the prison that holds
Cobra Commander and Destro?

339
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,589
这是我问你，
你有什么计划吗？
Is this where I ask you,
what do you have planned?

340
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,511
为什么没有人想成为总统？
Why does anyone want to be President?

341
00:23:46,008 --> 00:23:48,852
每个人都想要统治世界。
Everybody wants to rule the world.

342
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,063
所有队员
我们准备撤离了
All squads,
gear up and clear the L.Z.

343
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,190
准备开启一号机库
Prepare for extraction.

344
00:24:01,357 --> 00:24:03,735
要撤离了 不需要我们了
Extraction? What are we, teeth?

345
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,578
 - 到达H.Q.？
 - 不，我什么也没得到。
- Reach H.Q.?
- No, I got nothing.

346
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:09,581
 - 联络上了吗。
 - 好的 中士。
- Go up high.
- Roger, Sarge.

347
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,579
路霸。
Block.

348
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,129
我们的人都还在 没有一个人伤亡
All our men accounted for.
Not a single drop of blood.

349
00:24:15,204 --> 00:24:16,330
 - 干得漂亮。
 - 是的，先生。
- Boots to asses.
- Yes, sir.

350
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,086
你没事吧...
你刮你的胳膊肘？
Except for that...
Did you scrape your elbow?

351
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:20,751
 - 不，这是红色的汗水。
 - 是啊。
- No, it's red sweat.
- Yup.

352
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:23,796
这更好的了
某人的脸。
That better have been
on somebody's face.

353
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,727
嘿，公爵。
Hey, Duke.

354
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:33,268
你看到了吗？
You see that?

355
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,820
后续部队
Security's early.

356
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:43,065
 - 趴下！
 - 趴下！
- Get down!
- Take cover!

357
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,533

趴下 趴下
On the ground! On the ground!

360
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,717
鼠仔！

361
00:25:07,798 --> 00:25:08,890
快跑 兄弟
Get 'em out of the L.Z.!

362
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:09,967

弗林特！受伤了！
Flint's down! Flint's down!

365
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,812
 - 我去救他！
 - ！
- I'm going for him!
- Go!

366
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,493
十点钟方向
Ten o'clock!

367
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:34,499
趴下！
Get down!

368
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,416
部队接触！
立即请求空中支援！
Troops in contact!
Request immediate air support!

369
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:40,247
我再说一遍，直接空中支援！
I repeat, immediate air support!

370
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,460
你没事吧？来吧，我们必须要继续前进！

You all right? Come on, we got to move!

372
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:51,008
怎么样 没事吧
You good? You hit?

373
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,515
路霸，我找到了火石。我们需要掩护！
Block, I got Flint. We got to get to cover!

374
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,017

384
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,022
隐蔽
Fall back! Fall back!

385
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:46,256
这儿也没问题
We're clear.

386
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,135
走吧！
Let's go!

387
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,739
我们已经遇到了敌人
We have met the enemy

388
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,823
他就是我们自己。
and he is us.

389
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:19,831
今天世界上最精锐的著名的特种部队
Today, the world's elite fighting force,
the G. I. Joes,

390
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:22,251
背叛了自己的职责
abandoned their duty

391
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:28,920
他们已经辜负了
and broke the sacred bond
that exists between

392
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,796
美国人民
the American people

393
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,925
对他们保卫安全的嘱托
and those entrusted with their security.

394
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,010
准备好了 上
Ready and step.

395
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:43,188
准备
Ready and

396
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:44,473
上！
step!

397
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:48,356
他们所走的第一步就是暗杀了巴基斯坦总统
The first domino fell with
the murder of the Pakistani president.

398
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,604
刺客
The assassin,

399
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:52,489
是一个特种兵，
a Joe,

400
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,325
他的代号
call sign

401
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:57,695
蛇眼。
Snake Eyes.

402
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:00,872
但他并没有单独行动。
But he didn't act alone.

403
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,120
特种部队就是准备利用混乱的局面
The Joes intended to use this situation

404
00:29:06,203 --> 00:29:09,548
控制巴基斯坦的核武库。
to seize Pakistan's nuclear arsenal.

405
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,341
现在这个事件
Now this incident

406
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:15,512
再次向我们敲响警钟 谨防核武器带来的灾难
serves as a sobering reminder
of the scourge of nuclear weapons.

407
00:29:15,796 --> 00:29:17,469
为了达成目标
And to that end,

408
00:29:17,798 --> 00:29:20,426
我呼吁我的同胞世界各国领导人
I call upon my fellow world leaders

409
00:29:20,509 --> 00:29:23,683
立即召开会议，讨论
to convene immediately to discuss

410
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,185
核裁军。
nuclear disarmament.

411
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:28,642
三个。
On three.

412
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,482
 - 一个。
- One.

413
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:33,029
二。
Two .

414
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,439
三！
Three!

415
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,776
G. I.特种兵
The G. I. Joes

416
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:41,030
完全超出了他们的授权任务范围
clearly went beyond
the boundaries of their mission.

417
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,205
在我的命令下
On my orders

418
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,834
一个隐蔽的特种部队
代码名为眼镜蛇
a covert Special Forces unit
code named Cobra

419
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:50,335
他们执行命令 已经彻底消灭了他们的
terminated with extreme prejudice
Joe Command,

420
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,882
人员和设施
facilities, personnel.

421
00:29:57,504 --> 00:30:01,225
特种部队不存在了。
The G.I. Joes are no more.

422
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:39,971
我们应该离开。
We should leave.

423
00:30:42,883 --> 00:30:44,510
这里什么都没了
There's nothing here.

424
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,110
这里什么都没了
There's nothing left here?

425
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,025
 - 这不是他的意思！
 - 这些都是我们的兄弟！
- That's not what he meant!
- These are our brothers!

426
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,230
这不是他的意思！
That's not what he meant!

427
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:04,951
昨晚来的敌人一定会再回来
Whoever did this is going to come back.

428
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:09,084
我们得赶紧走
We need to move.

429
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:20,296
你现在是我们的领袖。
You are our leader now.

430
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,355
我们前往正东，直到我们清楚。
We head due east until we're clear.

431
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:35,152
我们要找到这些人
谁这样干掉公爵
We're gonna find the man
who did this to Duke

432
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:36,524
我们的兄弟。
and our brothers.

433
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:39,234
我们会杀了他。
And we're gonna kill him.

434
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,072
蛇眼。
Snake Eyes.

435
00:32:28,405 --> 00:32:30,407
这是你最后的终点
Last place I thought I'd see you.

436
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,748
监狱长詹姆斯。幸会
Warden James. It's a pleasure.

437
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,796
我是你的忠实粉丝 我喜欢你的黑色
I'm a very big fan. I love the black.

438
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:38,419
那是相当的时尚
It's very Johnny Cash.

439
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,044
你来吧。欢迎来到地下监狱
Come. Welcome to Einsargen.

440
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,721
让我告诉你一点点
约的地方。
Let me tell you a little bit
about the place.

441
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,889
听我说。
我听起来像一个真正的房地产经纪人。
Listen to me.
I sound like a real-estate agent.

442
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,592
我不是在这里向你推销什么。
I'm not here to sell you anything.

443
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:51,428
也许除了绝望。
Except maybe hopelessness.

444
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,769
这次旅行怎么样？
How was your trip?

445
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:17,629
你现在是不是觉得有点头重脚轻
The sensation that you're feeling,
your upside-down tummy?

446
00:33:17,954 --> 00:33:20,707
这是由于我们进入
一个前东德矿井。
It's due to our descent into
a former East German mine shaft.

447
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,792
这是他们曾经挖最深的。
It was the deepest they ever dug.

448
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:26,221
如此之深，事实上，
你刚刚跨过德国
So deep in fact that
you just crossed out of Germany

449
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:28,139
进入国际领土。
into international territory.

450
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,471
这让我
Which allows me

451
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:33,312
某些司法管辖区的自由。
certain jurisdictional freedoms.

452
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,107
咦？
Huh?

453
00:33:41,311 --> 00:33:42,654
有一个词，
One word,

454
00:33:43,063 --> 00:33:46,158
真棒。这间客房是真棒！
awesome. This room is awesome!

455
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:50,078
这里的温度超过210度
Temperatures here exceed 210 degrees

456
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:53,991
但我们有了人工降温的装置 降到了68度
when not artificially cooled to a crisp 68.

457
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,910
差不多都可以穿得上长袖衬衫
Almost calls for a Snuggie.

458
00:33:59,496 --> 00:34:00,839
接下来的更精彩
Wait till you see this next one.

459
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,515
明白我的意思吗？我都被震撼到了
See what I mean? This just slays me.

460
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,682
它是如此有趣。
这就是科技的最前沿
It's so interesting.
This is where science has come.

461
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,602
你知道吗，在浅度睡眠状态
Did you know that during REM sleep,

462
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,683
人体
the human body

463
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,610
产生的神经化学物质
produces a neural chemical

464
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,688
瘫痪身体的每一块肌肉
which paralyses
every muscle in the body

465
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,524
但心脏和眼睛除外
这可以防止我们
but the heart and the eyes?
This prevents us

466
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,530
在睡梦中身体乱动
from acting out our dreams.

467
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:32,617
我们给这两位都已经注射了
We have injected both of these men

468
00:34:33,363 --> 00:34:34,785
这种合成化学物质
with a synthetic version.

469
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,038
他们是完全清醒的。
他们是有意识的，
They're perfectly awake.
They're conscious,

470
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:39,870
他们知道的一切
他们周围的一切。
they're aware of everything
that's going on around them.

471
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,041
这只是他们
自己被困在里面。
It's just that they're
trapped inside themselves.

472
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:50,221
好吧，我相信你知道
您的新邻居，毁灭，
Well, I believe you know
your new neighbours, Destro,

473
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:56,937
眼镜蛇指挥官。
Cobra Commander.

474
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,644
哦，你们三个一起凑成了我的梦之队
Oh, the three of you are like
my fantasy football team.

475
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,028
先生们。
Gentlemen.

476
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:15,576
现在你的眼睛和心灵
Now as your eyes and mind

477
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:19,910
旅行，你不能，
我要你烦恼。
travel to where you cannot,
I want you to agonise.

478
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:21,916
让你的忧伤
I want you to pine.

479
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:26,091
让你的痛苦 那种程度一般人有过一次就不想再有
I want you to ache for what once was
and will never be again.

480
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:30,090
我会让你再也不想着逃跑了
I want you to doubt
that there was ever a word for escape.

481
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:33,257
欢迎来到地狱。
Welcome to hell.

482
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,099
你根本就不知道
You have no idea.

483
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:40,930
蛇眼说话了。
Snake Eyes speaks.

484
00:35:41,598 --> 00:35:44,101
我想象不出你说话时的声音
It never occurred to me
what you might sound like.

485
00:35:44,351 --> 00:35:47,104
不过我很想知道你到底长什么样
But I've always thought about
what you might look like.

486
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:50,281
摘下面具吧
We'll have that mask.

487
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,794
风暴阴影。
Storm Shadow.

488
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,965
所以，你杀了巴基斯坦总统。
So you killed the Pakistani president.

489
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,051
你虽然不是我的首选对象
Well, you're not exactly
my first-round draft pick,

490
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,132
但我永远是你的粉丝
but I've always been a fan.

491
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,641
按规定 我们该发出求救信号吗
Protocol says we make
a distress call, right?

492
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,522
不 部队都没了 还要什么规定
No.
Protocol died with the unit.

493
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,773
什么？
What?

494
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,229
那怎么让人知道我们还活着
How's anybody gonna know we're alive?

495
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,404
没必要 我们死了
They're not, 'cause we're not.

496
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,532
政府这么想
To our government,

497
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:36,031
我们的家庭，
但尤其是我们的敌人，
to our families,
but especially to our enemy,

498
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:39,115
也都以为我们早上6点已经在河谷沙漠阵亡了
we were KIA at 0600 hours
in the Indus Valley Desert.

499
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,282
但是，我们必须至少尝试。
我的意思是，有可能是...
But we have to at least try.
I mean, there might be...

500
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:44,202
不 现在做什么都无法证明清白
No. Anything we do now
is a rumour of a rumour.

501
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,286
任何和所有的痕迹
Any and all traces

502
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:47,335
都被抹去了
of our existence is terminated.

503
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:50,626
我们现在唯一能信任的只有蛇眼
The only one I trust out there
is Snake Eyes.

504
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:54,755
当我们腹背受敌，
When we got hit,

505
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,132
我们怎么腹背受敌
how we got hit,

506
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,767
都是预先设计好的
we were set up right from the start.

507
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,179
多高的军衔才能
How many stars would
someone need on their shoulder

508
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,640
调用这样的攻击？四星？五星？
to call an attack like that? Four? Five?

509
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:07,397
不，不是星级。他的西装上的按钮。
No, not stars. Buttons on his suit.

510
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:10,525
国家安全顾问。
国防部长。
National Security Advisor.
Secretary of Defence.

511
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:13,903
号只有一个人
谁可以授权这样的一击。
No. There's only one man
who could authorise a strike like that.

512
00:37:14,733 --> 00:37:16,406
我投他的票。
And I voted for him.

513
00:37:26,828 --> 00:37:28,830
眼镜蛇指挥官主要生命指标正常
All Vitals
on Cobra Commander are steady.

514
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,012
风暴阴影
注射神经合成素。
Storm Shadow
nerve prohibitors injected.

515
00:37:45,472 --> 00:37:47,600
62度 浮动范围是4%
Sixty-two degrees on a change of 4%.

516
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,370
有空袭  趴下
Aerial threat! Down!

517
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,439
我们要回家了。
We're going home.

518
00:39:44,966 --> 00:39:46,968
警报 警报
Full arrest! Full arrest!

519
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,100
心跳停止了 这不是演习
No drill! Bring the restraints!

520
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,563
把容器的盖子掀开
Remove the containment lid!

521
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,691
血清在哪里？赶快行动吧！
Where's the serum? Quickly!

522
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,654
现在肾上腺素。现在！肾上腺素！
Adrenaline now. Now! Adrenaline!

523
00:39:57,896 --> 00:40:00,069
走吧！快，快！
Let's go! Quickly, quickly!

524
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:02,366
快 快
Move! Move!

525
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,113
血清在哪里？
Where's the serum?

526
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:11,501
快上 快
Let's go!

527
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,371
他摆脱了 快
Peel back! Move!

528
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,131
你是什么意思，
他的心脏停止跳动吗？
What do you mean,
his heart stopped beating?

529
00:40:17,457 --> 00:40:20,051
这里没有人死，除非是我说的！
No one here dies unless I say so!

530
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,094
哦，我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

531
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:23,171
开枪
Fire!

532
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:27,888
开枪 开枪
Fire! Fire!

533
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,437
 - 干掉他！
- Take him down!

534
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,057
干掉他！
Take him down!

535
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,142
北边安全！
Clear on the north!

536
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,727
安全！
Clear!

537
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,084
欢迎来到地狱。
Welcome to hell.

538
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,552
停！
Stop!

539
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,014
不管什么从里头出来 都通通干掉
You shoot anything
that walks through that door!

540
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,144
格杀勿论
Anything!

541
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,481
风暴阴影。
Storm Shadow.

542
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,654
果然不负我期望
Never a doubt.

543
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,743
眼镜蛇指挥官。
Cobra Commander.

544
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,699
毁灭。
Destro.

545
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,836
你已经被开除了
You're out of the band.

546
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,209
来吧。
Come on.

547
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:45,586
来吧。
Come on.

548
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,606
我看你已经安排接应了。
I see you've arranged transportation.

549
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:18,414
我早上9点前引发的爆炸量
Making more things go boom
by 9:00 a.m.

550
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:20,541
比大多数人做了一整天还多。
than most people do all day.

551
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:24,246
萤火虫。很高兴见到你，老朋友。
Firefly. Good to see you, old friend.

552
00:44:24,579 --> 00:44:25,751
长官
Sir.

553
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,091
有些人只是不想让我进去。
Some people
just didn't want to let me in.

554
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,547
现在，我打掉了8个监狱。
Now, I busted out of eight prisons.

555
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,427
但我只闯进一个。
But I only broke into one.

556
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:40,387
所有通信已经截止。
没有人会知道你竟然不翼而飞。
All communications have been cutoff.
No one will know you're even missing.

557
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:00,619
带他到山上去治疗
Take him
to the mountains to heal.

558
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,415
我准备发动的战争里还用得上他
I'll need him
for the war I'm about to start.

559
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:39,909
 - 我想帮助你。
- I want to help you.

560
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:57,426
我们已经看到了风暴的伤害。
我们知道他在哪里的领导。
We've seen Storm's injuries.
We know where he's headed.

561
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,642
你需要我。
And you need me.

562
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:08,557
好。
Good.

563
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:26,451
长官，发射控制是差不多了。
进度一直被总监拖延
Sir, launch controls are nearly up.
The director was running behind.

564
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,877
他已经用不着拖延了 另外找人接管就是了
Well, he ain't running behind no more.
Or anywhere else, for that matter.

565
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,634
装甲原型
完全按您要求制作
Armour prototype
is complete to your specs.

566
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,586
我把测控器调到60了
I got it up to 60 on the dyno today.

567
00:46:36,836 --> 00:46:38,759
你会喜欢这个 新头衔，
You'll like this. Working title,

568
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:41,216
高速哨兵。简称西斯。
High Speed Sentry. HISS.

569
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,555
这是很好的你，先生。
It's good to have you back, sir.

570
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,646
她是不是一个美女？
Ain't she a beauty?

571
00:46:50,975 --> 00:46:54,980
很快世界
将畏缩在宙斯面前。
Soon the world
will cower in the face of Zeus.

572
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:06,492
您能回来真好 指挥官。
All we've been missing
is our Commander.

573
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:13,915
很酷的面具。
Cool mask.

574
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,127
有些人很悠闲呐
Someone took his time.

575
00:47:18,461 --> 00:47:21,305
要溜出那座白色大房子可不容易
Not easy to sneak out of that big, white,

576
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:24,133
11间卧室，35间半厕所...
11-bedroom, 35-and-a-half bath...

577
00:47:24,425 --> 00:47:26,723
只是不要忘了
Just don't forget who put you there.

578
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,645
你是从哪儿爬出来的
Or the rock you crawled out from.

579
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,524
萤火虫。很高兴我们还是这样疯狂
Firefly. It's good to know
we're not running low on crazy.

580
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:35,645
所有10个手指吗？
Still all 10 fingers?

581
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,780
我们的前总统是如何呢？
How is our former President?

582
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,115
哦，他的利用价值可高了
Oh, he is worth his weight in platinum.

583
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,782
有一种酷刑叫水刑
You know, they call it a waterboard,

584
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,122
但我从来不觉得无聊。
but I never get bored.

585
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,877
48小时之后 宙斯将会发射
In 48 hours,
Zeus will launch.

586
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,624
但是有个小问题
Just one wrinkle.

587
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,466
三名特种队员侥幸逃过一劫
Three Joes somehow survived
our little house cleaning.

588
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,219
一架无人机在河谷沙漠侦测到声波信号
A drone picked up voiceprints
in the Indus Valley.

589
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,266
我能相信你什么？
Can I trust you with nothing?

590
00:48:06,467 --> 00:48:07,969
他们会滑倒。
They'll slip up.

591
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:10,812
当他们这样做，
And when they do,

592
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,440
我会追捕他们到地面。
I'll hunt 'em to ground.

593
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:16,519
呼啊。
Hoo-ah.

594
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,916
不，不，这很酷。
No, no, it's cool.

595
00:48:34,495 --> 00:48:35,621
我得到了它。
I got it.

596
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,507
你迷路了吧，小个子？
You lost, little man?

597
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,002
不，我不会迷路。
No, I ain't lost.

598
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,462
我觉得你走错路了吧。
I think you got the wrong street.

599
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:45,594
你为什么不往麦莉赛勒斯走
So why don't you take Miley Cyrus

600
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,346
瑞安西克赖斯
and Ryan Seacrest

601
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,844
给我绕别的路
and head back that way?

602
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,688
我就要走这条道
I'm going that way.

603
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:56,354
哦，是吗？
Oh, yeah?

604
00:48:56,434 --> 00:48:57,560
嗯。
Yeah.

605
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,522
来吧，马文。
Go ahead, Marvin.

606
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,321
嘿，不叫我这个名字。
Man, don't call me that name.

607
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,447
 - 怎么了？小马文！
-- What's up? Little Marvin!

608
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,037
 - 马文？
 - 现在是大马文了。
- Marvin?
- Big Marvin now.

609
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,788
对不起 让你们担心了一下
Had you worried for a minute, man.

610
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,541
别乱动 朋友 小心受伤
Watch your hand back there, boy.
You don't want them to get you.

611
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,202
看着你长大了。
Look at you. You got grown.

612
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,128
你的父母怎么养大你的
How your parents
make a kid this big, man?

613
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:18,498
 - 他的父母养他很容易的。
 - 真的吗？
- His parents are like 5'2" apiece.
- Really?

614
00:49:18,581 --> 00:49:20,208
你服用P90X 很严重的，对吧？
You're taking
that P90X serious, huh?

615
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:21,588
每周两次。
Twice a week.

616
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,715
我明白。看在你的脖子的大小。
I see. Look at the size of your neck.

617
00:49:24,587 --> 00:49:26,305
让我给你介绍一下。这是弗林特。
Let me introduce you. This is Flint.

618
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,427
怎么了？
What up?

619
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:29,049
Jaye夫人。
Lady Jaye.

620
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,225
Jaye夫人。嘿。
Lady Jaye. Hey.

621
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,228
 - 欢迎回来。
 - 谢谢你。
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

622
00:49:32,553 --> 00:49:34,521
这是发生了什么
当你有麻烦时，你回家。
It's what happens
when you're in trouble, you come home.

623
00:49:34,597 --> 00:49:35,769
家永远会帮你。
Home is where the help is.

624
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:36,849
阿门。
Amen.

625
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,734
我们都支持你
Well, we got you.

626
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,481
这里可以当指挥中心
Set up at the rec centre.

627
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,814
低调。
没有人会打扰你。
Lay low over there.
Nobody gonna bother you.

628
00:49:43,314 --> 00:49:44,987
至于出行方面
As far as wheels go,

629
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,326
我会让你开我的卡车。
I'm gonna let you roll my truck.

630
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:48,573
谢谢。
Thank you.

631
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,742
我这车贷还没交完呢
I got payments on that truck, man.

632
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:52,831
我不明白，像我以前。没事吧？
I don't get it like I used to. All right?

633
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:53,908
谢谢，哥们儿。
Thank you, Stoop.

634
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:56,251
我欠你一个人情，兄弟。
I owe you one, brother.

635
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:59,251
其实，你欠我两个。
Actually, you owe me two.

636
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,249
 - 另一个不能算。
- That other one don't count.

637
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,009
欢迎回家，马文。
Welcome home, Marvin.

638
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:13,303
留神脚下。
Watch your step.

639
00:50:13,594 --> 00:50:16,814
这儿荒废多年 可以作为藏身之地使用
No one's been here for years.
This is gonna have to be our pit for now.

640
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,989
哇。这个地方不错。
Wow. It's an actual pit.

641
00:50:26,106 --> 00:50:27,779
我以前最喜欢来这儿了
It's my old stomping ground.

642
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,533
你确定
我们可以相信这个托普家伙？
Are you sure
we can trust this Stoop guy?

643
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,364
 - 斯托普不是天使。
- Stoop's no angel.

644
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,866
但他是一家人，我们可以信任他。
But he is family and we can trust him.

645
00:50:42,623 --> 00:50:43,966
我们可以追溯到吗？
Can we be traced?

646
00:50:44,291 --> 00:50:46,134
我们可以掩盖我们的IP地址。
We can mask our IP addresses.

647
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,554
我会每六小时改一次编码信号
I'll cyber-blast an encoded beacon
every six hours.

648
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,301
如果还有弟兄活着
If any Joes did survive,

649
00:50:50,381 --> 00:50:51,633
我们需要让他们知道
我们在哪里。
we need to let them know
where we're at.

650
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,058
好的。好吧，让我们去上班。
All right. Well, let's get to work.

651
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:55,394
弗林特，你来清点留下的所有装备
Flint, inventory every piece
of equipment we got left.

652
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,597
JAYE，建立数据库调查总统
Jaye, start that database
on our President.

653
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,308
我们会发现这位最高统帅到底是怎么了
We'll find out what's going on
with our Commander-in-Chief.

654
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:03,569
他可不像我们认识的那个人了 找出背后原因
He's not acting like the man we know.
We find out why,

655
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,900
我们就可以恢复军人身份了
we can start being soldiers again.

656
00:52:04,705 --> 00:52:06,924
中尉Jaye夫人，
请求紧急援助。
Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
requesting immediate aid.

657
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,463
如果任何特种兵幸存...
If any Joes have survived...

658
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,965
这是特种部队专属频道吧
This channel's restricted to Joes,
isn't it?

659
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:13,301
方位是 4-5-4-3 西部波托马克。
...magnetic west of the Potomac.

660
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:14,639
他们还活着。
They're alive.

661
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:17,385
这是Jaye夫人中尉
请求紧急援助。
This is Lieutenant Lady Jaye
requesting immediate aid.

662
00:52:18,469 --> 00:52:21,188
中尉Jaye夫人，
这是金克斯和蛇眼。
Lieutenant Lady Jaye,
this is Jinx and Snake Eyes.

663
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,140
我们都在追捕风暴阴影。
We are in pursuit of Storm Shadow.

664
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,688
即使蛇眼和金克斯
抓到风暴，
Even if Snake Eyes and Jinx
grab Storm,

665
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,649
可他们也在地球的另一边
they're still halfway around the world.

666
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:35,577
我们得靠自己了
We're on our own.

667
00:52:37,738 --> 00:52:39,081
足够为一个战斗。
Enough for a battle.

668
00:52:40,074 --> 00:52:41,121
打大仗不够
Not a war.

669
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,744
我们的敌人很强大
We're fighting uphill here.

670
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,925
我第一次来这儿的时候才14岁 人家以为我死了
I came here when I was 14
with a life expectancy of 13.

671
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:54,179
我不停地改变藏身的地点 直到来这儿
I was bounced around
from home to home, until this

672
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:57,386
成了我的家。
became my home.

673
00:52:57,466 --> 00:52:59,434
人们在外面排队 等着跟我打架
Guys were lined up
outside that door to fight me.

674
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:03,856
这么多，他们直喊我瘦屁股
从中取乐
They whooped my skinny ass so much
I started to enjoy it.

675
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,523
直到一个冬天，
Till one winter,

676
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:09,278
我增长了8英寸，并获得了60磅。
I grew 8 inches and gained 60 pounds.

677
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,033
把一个家伙打得半身不遂爬不动为止
I punched a guy so hard
he couldn't move his arm to tap out.

678
00:53:14,358 --> 00:53:16,611
特种部队来这儿招兵的时候
Then when the Joes
came recruiting to the hood,

679
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:18,787
我打倒了他们一半的人
I'd already beaten down half of it.

680
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:23,668
我成了特种部队的一员 上了前线
I became a Joe to serve. In the field.

681
00:53:24,243 --> 00:53:27,873
如果对手真的很强大 那就让他们来吧
So if we're fighting uphill,
we take the hill.

682
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:32,797
嗨 我有东西要给你们看
Hey, I got something
you'll want to see.

683
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,472
我在调查总统时有了新发现
During my check of the President,
look what I found.

684
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:39,475
这是8月9日的总统。
This is the President on August 9th.

685
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,893
过多地仰赖境外能源供给
...an addiction
to offshore energy,

686
00:53:42,136 --> 00:53:45,015
我们被迫卷入
where we're forced to be
kind of embroiled

687
00:53:45,097 --> 00:53:46,974
在外国的事务。
in the affairs of foreign nations.

688
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,984
这是10天后。
And this is 10 days later.

689
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,024
否则，我的意思是，我们有点...
I mean, otherwise, we're sort of...

690
00:53:53,522 --> 00:53:56,196
这些都是会话惯用语
These are conversational fillers.
Little phrases

691
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:58,160
是人随口说出的
we spit out to give our brain
a chance to catch up

692
00:53:58,402 --> 00:53:59,779
以填补思考间隙的词语。喜欢...
with our mouth. Like...

693
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,288
 - 喜欢。
 - 是的。
- Like.
- Yes.

694
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:02,873
我们的总统呢？
And our President?

695
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:05,117
8月9日和8月19日之间，
Between August 9th and August 19th,

696
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:06,953
他停止使用
“你知道”和“有点”
he stopped using
"you know" and "kind of"

697
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:09,208
并开始使用“我的意思是”和“之类的。”
and started using "I mean" and "sort of."

698
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:11,882
但是，这还不是全部。
“晚餐”成为“吃饭。”
But that's not all.
"Supper" became "dinner."

699
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,174
“苏打水”成为“汽水”。
"Soda" became "pop."

700
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:16,337
一个总统，说话两种风格。
One President, two fingerprints.

701
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,547
但它是一个几句话，对不对？
我的意思是，能有多大......
But it's a few words, right?
I mean, how much can...

702
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,677
再往下看
Check this out.

703
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,678
两个新闻发布会，
7月31日，9月1日。
Two press conferences,
July 31st, September 1st.

704
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:26,513
注意他的手指
See his fingers clasped?

705
00:54:27,014 --> 00:54:29,187
左手拇指之上
与右手拇指在上面。
Left thumb on top
versus right thumb on top.

706
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:31,189
同一个人绝不可能会这样
The same person
never does this differently,

707
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,520
感到不对劲。
it feels wrong.

708
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,525
如果总统
What if the President

709
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,028
不是他本人呢
isn't the President?

710
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:45,207
如果最高统帅都可以冒名顶替
Look, if the Commander-in-Chief
is an imposter

711
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,544
而且他下令攻击，
and he's the one that ordered the attack,

712
00:54:48,869 --> 00:54:51,543
那我们就谁也不可能信任了 对不对
we have to assume
that there's no one we can trust.

713
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:53,211
有一个人。
There is one man.

714
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,463
他的理由，我们称自己为特种兵。
He's the reason we call ourselves Joes.

715
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:29,910
喂？
Hello?

716
00:55:42,631 --> 00:55:46,306
我会买两包薄荷味饼干和一盒巧克力
I'll take two cases of Thin Mints
and a box of Chuckle Lucks.

717
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:48,642
放下你的武器。
Lower your weapons.

718
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:52,983
科尔顿，恕我冒昧...
General Colton, if I may...

719
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,644
闭上你的嘴，布伦达。
Shut your mouth, Brenda.

720
00:55:56,270 --> 00:55:58,068
我的名字不是布伦达。
My name's not Brenda.

721
00:55:58,313 --> 00:55:59,656
你怎么进来？
How'd you get in?

722
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,655
先生，道歉。
Sir, apologies.

723
00:56:01,984 --> 00:56:04,157
 - 我是马文中士...
 - 我知道你是谁。
- Sergeant Marvin...
- I know who you are.

724
00:56:04,486 --> 00:56:05,908
那您该知道我为什么来
Then you know why I'm here.

725
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:16,506
我一直在想你们说的
It's not like
I don't hear what you're saying.

726
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,334
总统 竟是个冒牌货
But an imposter President?

727
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,507
被将军一说
这听起来很疯狂？
How come when the General says it,
it sounds crazy?

728
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,927
那真的总统怎么样了？
What'd they do with the real President?

729
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,562
我们担心他已经死了。
We fear he's dead.

730
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:34,771
我不这么想 有用的人质你是不会杀的
I don't think so.
You're not going to kill your best asset.

731
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,029
“康拉德公爵豪瑟”。
"Conrad Hauser. Duke."

732
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,032
你的队长。
Your captain.

733
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:48,288
告诉我一件事，你对他的了解。
Tell me one thing you know about him.

734
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,290
伟大的战士。
Great soldier.

735
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:54,203
更好的朋友。
Better friend.

736
00:56:55,037 --> 00:56:57,039
他救了我的命，先生。
And he saved my life, sir.

737
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,131
好。
Good.

738
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,304
你提出的是叛国罪。
What you're proposing is treason.

739
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:10,219
我会需要比拇指重叠
I'm gonna need something
a little more to go on

740
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:11,804
更多的证据。
than overlapping thumbs.

741
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,479
在你退休之前，
你担任一个安全事务委员会
Before you retired,
you served on a security commission

742
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:18,481
总统的参谋长。
with the President's Chief of Staff.

743
00:57:18,727 --> 00:57:20,570
将军科尔顿，你能不能让我们更接近？
General Colton, can you get us close?

744
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,151
不行。
Negative.

745
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,406
在这个小镇，我一有小动作就会被列入黑名单。
I can't scratch my ass in this town
without getting on the watch list.

746
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,495
布伦达，递给我那支笔。
Brenda, hand me that pen.

747
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:32,328
这下我又变成秘书了
Girl Scout to secretary.

748
00:57:32,824 --> 00:57:35,668
接着 我不叫布兰达
Amazing. Name's not Brenda.

749
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,502
这只是一支笔。
It's just a pen.

750
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,385
大道K，乔治敦。晚上九时
Avenue K, Georgetown. 9:00 p.m.

751
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:46,839
参谋长在那儿打扑克牌
There's a poker game
with the Chief of Staff there.

752
00:57:47,673 --> 00:57:49,175
他不是一个好的扑克选手。
He's not a good poker player.

753
00:57:49,341 --> 00:57:50,684
每次都破绽百出
He's got 1,000 tells.

754
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:56,356
我们只需要一个。
We only need one.

755
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:00,940
嘿，亲爱的。
Hey, hon.

756
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,027
刚打完牌出来 输了点 但长了经验
Just got out of poker. Poorer but wiser.

757
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,696
其实这是一个很好的一天。
It was a good day, actually.

758
00:58:06,942 --> 00:58:09,365
佩雷斯
总统他吃错药了。
The Prez was taking
his crazy pills again.

759
00:58:11,947 --> 00:58:14,291
宝贝，我要去给你回电话。
Baby, I'm gonna have to call you back.

760
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:15,705
嗯。
Yeah.

761
00:58:15,867 --> 00:58:17,210
爱你。
Love you.

762
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,966
对不起。
Excuse me.

763
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,301
哦，嗨。
Oh, hi.

764
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,545
嗨。
Hi.

765
00:58:26,878 --> 00:58:28,721
要不要我帮个忙
You need a hand with your bags?

766
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:30,553
当然。
Sure.

767
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,514
没问题。你去那里。
No problem. There you go.

768
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,594
谢谢。
Thank you.

769
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,147
你真有骑士风度
Who said chivalry is dead, right?

770
00:58:37,222 --> 00:58:38,314
骑士风度
Chivalry.

771
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,561
那是不是有追兵要找我的麻烦呢
Talk like that,
I'm gonna get myself in trouble.

772
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,019
我们向何处去？
Where we heading?

773
00:58:43,103 --> 00:58:44,150
那边 拐弯
Just right around the corner.

774
00:58:53,739 --> 00:58:55,707
刺痛的感觉是异戊巴比妥。
That tingly feeling is amobarbital.

775
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,160
会造成失忆的镇静剂
It's a sedative that causes
anterograde amnesia.

776
00:58:58,577 --> 00:58:59,874
五分钟后，你会是睡着了。
In five minutes, you're gonna be asleep.

777
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,502
再过5分钟，你会醒来
忘记我曾经存在过。
In another five, you're gonna wake up
with no idea I ever existed.

778
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,714
有没有发现总统怪怪的
Notice anything strange
about your boss?

779
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,390
也许吧。为什么呢？
Maybe. Why?

780
00:59:15,635 --> 00:59:18,184
你要帮我们打一个电话。让我们靠近他。
'Cause you're gonna make
a phone call for us. Get us close to him.

781
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,603
不过不用担心。
你会忘记一切，
But don't worry.
You're gonna forget everything,

782
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:22,810
你的意识也会恢复
so your conscience will be clear.

783
00:59:23,727 --> 00:59:25,650
你为什么这样做？
Why are you doing this?

784
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,948
就算我告诉你你也不信
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

785
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,610
拨打电话。
Make the call.

786
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,035
哦！
Oh!

787
01:08:09,002 --> 01:08:10,345
感谢上帝。
Thank God.

788
01:08:20,346 --> 01:08:22,690
总统先生最近意气风发
El Presidente is on a roll.

789
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,604
支持率在增长
His numbers are up.

790
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:27,107
我不只是在谈论他的年龄。
And I'm not just talking about his age.

791
01:08:29,022 --> 01:08:31,366
我现在可不想讨论他的八卦
Now, I'm not gonna call
our Commander-in-Chief old.

792
01:08:31,983 --> 01:08:34,862
毕竟他已经是高龄人士了
Actually, he called me the other day
for some advice.

793
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,704
 - 晚上好。
 - 晚上好。
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

794
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,741
他希望能将美国的核武器装备
He wanted to hook up
the nation's nuclear arsenal

795
01:08:39,824 --> 01:08:40,871
用来吓小鸟
to the Clapper.

796
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:46,964
对不起，小姐，你......
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're...

797
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,758
迟到了，我知道。
Late, I know.

798
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,718
我用了一个军队的人才打扮成这样
Imagine the army it takes
to make me look like this.

799
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:54,847
说实话 我很愿意加入那个军队
Forgive me.
That's an army I'd like to enlist in.

800
01:08:55,048 --> 01:08:56,846
再查一下
Speaking of lists,

801
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,519
能否解释下您怎么没在名单上
would you like to explain
why you're not on ours?

802
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:02,396
她在这儿 办公厅主任的人
Here she is. Chief of Staff.

803
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:06,184
祝您今晚愉快，德沃特小姐。
Enjoy your evening, Miss Vandervoort.

804
01:09:13,191 --> 01:09:14,192
我进来
I'm in.

805
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,243
收到。请待命。
Roger that. Standing by.

806
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:18,279
JAYE？
Jaye?

807
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:21,416
你要尽量低调 保证安全
You keep your head down. Be safe.

808
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,167
卡维尔先生 采纳了我的一项主张
Mr Carville was
nice enough to mention

809
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,212
核武器的裁减
one of my passions.
Nuclear disarmament.

810
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:27,914
就在几天后
In just days,

811
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,546
八个有核国家的最高元首
the leaders of the world's
eight nuclear nations

812
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,552
将聚集在历史悠久的萨姆特堡
will gather at historic Fort Sumter

813
01:09:33,753 --> 01:09:35,755
举行核峰会。
for a nuclear summit.

814
01:09:37,173 --> 01:09:40,518
在核八国峰会之前
But before the Atomic Eight
break bread,

815
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:41,932
轮到我们了。
it's our turn.

816
01:09:43,054 --> 01:09:44,727
谢谢你，詹姆斯。谢谢。
Thank you, James. Thank you so much.

817
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,609
总统先生。
艾米德沃特，福克斯新闻。
Mr President.
Amy Vandervoort, Fox News.

818
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,949
哦，福克斯，当然。
Oh, Fox, of course.

819
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:57,243
这就是为什么你看起来那么
“客观和平衡。”
That's why you look so
"fair and balanced."

820
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:00,947
很可爱。
但实际上，我是希望有一个...
Very cute.
But I was actually hoping to have a...

821
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:02,323
跳舞？
Dance?

822
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,121
 - 我想请您谈谈。
 - 嗯。
- I was going to say, quote.
- Ah.

823
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,710
好吧 那我就说两句
Okay, here's a quote.

824
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:08,629
世界将因即将召开的核峰会而改变
The world will change
after my nuclear summit.

825
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:10,298
怎么样，我们跳舞吗？
How about we dance?

826
01:10:11,582 --> 01:10:13,755
我真的...不太会跳舞。
I really, I don't dance.

827
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:15,753
抱歉。
Sorry.

828
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:18,635
谢谢你，总统先生。
你给我我需要什么。
Thank you, Mr President.
You gave me what I need.

829
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,800
我得回去赶稿子了
But I really have to make my deadline.

830
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,144
 - 这真是我的荣幸。
 - 谢谢你。
- It's been a pleasure.
- Thank you.

831
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:29,768
你怎么样？
How are you?

832
01:10:29,851 --> 01:10:30,977
好，总统阁下。
Good, sir.

833
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:43,281
我从他的外套得到了一缕头发
我希望这是够用的。
I got a strand of hair
from his jacket. I hope it's enough.

834
01:10:43,531 --> 01:10:45,033
快快。
Come on.

835
01:10:45,116 --> 01:10:46,208
收到了。
Copy that.

836
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:47,623
正准备身份确认
Standing by for I.D.

837
01:10:55,835 --> 01:10:58,839
所有单位，橙色警报。
警戒。
All units, setting condition orange.
Stand by.

838
01:10:59,881 --> 01:11:02,555
还没有人敢对我说不呢
I don't take no for an answer.

839
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:10,608
快完成了
Almost there.

840
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,103
来吧，来吧，来吧，来吧。
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

841
01:11:16,856 --> 01:11:17,857
Zartan？
Zartan?

842
01:11:19,567 --> 01:11:21,490
JAYE，快离开那里。
Jaye, get out of there now.

843
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,488
哦，我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

844
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,165
查到她的身份了 是特种部队的
We have an unauthorised I.D.
She's a Joe.

845
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,334
有特种部队潜入
We have a Joe on the premises.

846
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,251
JAYE。
Jaye.

847
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,217
JAYE，快走。
Jaye, now.

848
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,182
我出来。
I'm out.

849
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:48,763
“B计划”，布拉沃汇合。
Plan B, rendezvous Bravo.

850
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:50,564
改了，在查理汇合。
Negative.
Proceed to rendezvous Charlie.

851
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:51,808
查理。
Charlie.

852
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:54,109
什么意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

853
01:11:55,228 --> 01:11:56,650
对不起，JAYE。
Sorry, Jaye.

854
01:11:58,439 --> 01:11:59,440
我在这里能搞定。
I got it from here.

855
01:12:00,066 --> 01:12:01,067
不要。
Don't.

856
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:03,994
我们有证据。
我们的采样是Zartan的。
We have proof.
We're taking it to Joe Cotton.

857
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,572
你照计划进行。
You planned this all along.

858
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:07,331
路霸，停下。
Block, stand down.

859
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:09,750
我们是不是律师。我们是军人。
We ain't lawyers. We're soldiers.

860
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:12,541
我告诉你，我要去
谁都会这样做的。
I told you I was gonna
find the man who did this.

861
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:15,039
我要杀了他。
I was gonna kill him.

862
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,461
没有！这是...别这么干！
No! That's... No. Negative!

863
01:12:16,624 --> 01:12:18,297
路霸 路霸
Block. Block.

864
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:22,713
该死的！
Damn it!

865
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:27,143
一枪命中
One in the chamber.

866
01:12:38,855 --> 01:12:40,698
路霸 路霸 你在哪儿
Block? Block, where are you?

867
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:35,044
我就是想看你这个表情
I want to see that face.

868
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,294
你终于知道今天就是你的死期
The one where you realise
today's the day.

869
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:42,426
你的表情就跟我那天在沙漠里
It's the face all those pretty little Joes
had in the desert

870
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,253
放烟火炸死你们的队员一样
when I lit them all up like fireworks!

871
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,945
我真想看你这个表情
I really want to see that face.

872
01:14:06,233 --> 01:14:07,610
看到了吗
There it is.

873
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:43,313
如果眼镜蛇和Zartan
控制了白宫，
If Cobra and Zartan
are in the White House,

874
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,069
那这个世界就危险了
then the world is at stake.

875
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:46,737
风暴阴影。
Storm Shadow.

876
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:49,410
你可以告诉我们眼镜蛇的计划，
You will tell us Cobra's endgame,

877
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:51,829
或选择死亡
or die

878
01:14:52,071 --> 01:14:56,292
你用来杀死刚大师的这把刀下
by the same sword you once
used to kill our master.

879
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:57,789
你的剑，
Your sword,

880
01:14:59,870 --> 01:15:03,044
是我们爱戴的刚大师赐予你的
given to you
by our beloved Hard Master.

881
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:07,424
你是否承认是你的妒忌和仇恨
Do you deny that your envy and hatred
drove you to shed

882
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:09,926
使这上面沾上刚大师的血
the Hard Master's blood?

883
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:14,807
一段充满仇恨的人生
It's possible
to feel so much hate

884
01:15:15,261 --> 01:15:17,605
已经感觉不到仇恨了
you stop feeling it at all.

885
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:21,401
像鱼一样的，不知道它是在水中。
Like a fish not knowing it's in water.

886
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:26,235
我的人生道路早已被选定
But my path was chosen for me

887
01:15:27,440 --> 01:15:28,942
我的敌人
by my enemy

888
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:32,779
他把杀害大师的罪名套在我身上
who framed me
for killing the Hard Master.

889
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:37,913
而我的朋友们
And my friends

890
01:15:40,161 --> 01:15:41,913
深信我是凶手
who believed it.

891
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:50,054
有眼无珠之辈 没有争辩的必要
Why defend yourself to men
too blind to see?

892
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,017
这是刚大师的血。
That is the Hard Master's blood.

893
01:15:57,970 --> 01:15:59,313
但是，这是不是......
But that is not...

894
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:04,397
等一下！
Wait!

895
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:06,816
我的刀。
...my sword.

896
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,249
岚影族的刀是不会断的
Arashikage steel does not break.

897
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,166
我问自己一遍又一遍
I have asked myself over and over

898
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:31,929
是谁恨我恨到要毁了我的人生才行
who despised me enough
to destroy my life?

899
01:16:33,506 --> 01:16:35,554
对不起，
风暴阴影。
I am sorry,
Storm Shadow.

900
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:39,311
可是什么人最能从你的痛苦中获利呢
But who would stand to gain the most
by framing you for this crime?

901
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:45,356
是你的童年时代给你蒙上了阴影
Your young adversary
who chased you away?

902
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:55,779
还是你后来跟随的人给你留下了阴影
Or the man into whose arms
you were chased.

903
01:16:58,364 --> 01:17:00,366
有人收留了你
Someone who welcomed you,

904
01:17:01,158 --> 01:17:02,910
对你展现出善意
showed you kindness.

905
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:04,833
他需要我。
He needed me.

906
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,039
我会成为谁。
For who I would become.

907
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,965
成了武艺精湛残酷的武士
A warrior of great skill and anger.

908
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:18,225
那个背叛我的人既能干又精明狡诈
The man who betrayed me
was capable of great ingenuity,

909
01:17:21,178 --> 01:17:22,680
残忍
violence,

910
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,193
最可怕的是
but most of all,

911
01:17:29,687 --> 01:17:31,189
伪装。
disguise.

912
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:36,361
Zartan。
Zartan.

913
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:38,449
是。
Yes.

914
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:42,833
请告诉我们，他和眼镜蛇有什么阴谋
Tell us what he and Cobra have planned

915
01:17:43,159 --> 01:17:46,003
让我们一起对抗共同的敌人
so we can destroy our common enemy

916
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,005
一起来吧
together.

917
01:17:52,543 --> 01:17:53,920
尽量保持静止。
Try to hold still.

918
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:59,388
你想要我怎么配合
应该再来一次袭击？ 
You want to remind me how knuckles
are supposed to strike again?

919
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:01,177
一起吗？
Together.

920
01:18:02,469 --> 01:18:03,595
这些都是你的话。
Those were your words.

921
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:06,224
 - 我有一个机会，我也做了。
 - 现在，别说了！
- I had a shot and I took it.
- Now, don't give me that!

922
01:18:06,307 --> 01:18:07,308
去你的。
You went rogue.

923
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:08,358
我会再次这样做。
And I'd do it again.

924
01:18:08,434 --> 01:18:10,528
是吗？到底是什么东西
你的大计划，然后，对吧？
Yeah? And what was
your big plan, then, huh?

925
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,321
你希望你自己被打死？
You get yourself killed?

926
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:17,285
耶稣基督。我听到的一切
你说一遍又一遍。
Jesus Christ. I listened to everything
you said over and over again.

927
01:18:18,027 --> 01:18:19,028
我从来没有质疑...
I never questioned...

928
01:18:19,236 --> 01:18:21,364
我想牺牲更多的特种兵。
I wasn't going to bury any more Joes.

929
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,419
我要清理枪支。
I've got guns to clean.

930
01:18:49,308 --> 01:18:50,309
嘿。
Hey.

931
01:18:51,685 --> 01:18:52,937
来帮忙？
Help me out here?

932
01:18:59,985 --> 01:19:01,157
谢谢。
Thanks.

933
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:22,174
如果我爸爸能看到我现在...
If my dad could see me now...

934
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:23,926
你说的是什么？
What are you talking about?

935
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,937
你不会相信的。
He wouldn't believe it.

936
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,018
为什么呢？
Why?

937
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:34,436
我们家三代都是军人
Third generation military.

938
01:19:34,687 --> 01:19:37,190
爸爸想培养第四代
Desperately wanted a fourth, and

939
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:39,404
我妈却生了我。
my mom had me.

940
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:46,707
那么，他一定是
真正为你感到骄傲吧
Well, he must be
real proud of you, then.

941
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,372
他不相信
在女战士。
He didn't believe
in female soldiers.

942
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:52,713
最后我问他为什么。他说，
I finally asked him why. He said

943
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,210
他不会把性命交到女人的手上
he didn't want to put his life
in the hands of a woman.

944
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:01,471
第二天我就入伍了
I enlisted the next day.

945
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:05,221
接下来的七年里
Spent the next seven years

946
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:08,521
我试图超越他
让他向我敬礼。
trying to outrank him
so he'd have to salute me.

947
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,182
你做到了吗
Did it work?

948
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,985
可惜他没看到就死了
He died before I got the chance.

949
01:20:24,903 --> 01:20:26,246
对不起。
I'm sorry.

950
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:46,759
实际上，我喜欢穿红的。
I'm actually gonna miss the red.

951
01:20:49,053 --> 01:20:50,475
挺好看的
You look real nice.

952
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:55,893
嘿。我说，我们有枪要清洁。
Hey. I said we got guns to clean.

953
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:58,528
世界不是本身保存。
The world ain't saving itself.

954
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:03,363
这一拳是为你征税打的
That was for the tax hike.

955
01:21:03,609 --> 01:21:05,532
就好像你交过税似的
Like you pay taxes.

956
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,946
是不是总是我。
Ain't always about me.

957
01:21:08,947 --> 01:21:10,574
嘿，嘿，嘿，嘿。
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

958
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,707
我们仍然需要这个人。
We still need the man.

959
01:21:15,371 --> 01:21:17,874
他还有利用价值
Besides, we've grown close.

960
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,377
风暴阴影？
Is Storm Shadow in?

961
01:21:21,627 --> 01:21:25,552
用不着你来操心 他的状态好得很
Don't you worry about him.
He'll be more than ready.

962
01:21:26,006 --> 01:21:28,259
我实在不太看好你的内阁
I'm not too impressed with your Cabinet.

963
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:32,013
不就是经过听证会嘛 你就认了吧
No confirmation
hearings, that's what you get.

964
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:34,977
够了！
Enough!

965
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:37,230
接下来我说了算
I'll take it from here.

966
01:21:39,269 --> 01:21:41,237
谁控制公文包，
He who controls this briefcase,

967
01:21:41,563 --> 01:21:44,237
就控制美国的核武库
controls the U.S. nuclear arsenal

968
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:45,909
和人类的命运。
and the fate of humanity.

969
01:21:47,152 --> 01:21:49,575
睁开你的眼睛，前总统先生。
Open your eyes, Mr Ex-President.

970
01:21:50,781 --> 01:21:53,455
眼睛是心灵的窗户
The eyes are
the windows to the soul.

971
01:21:56,286 --> 01:21:57,629
睁开
Open up.

972
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,047
宙斯是准备好了。
Zeus is ready.

973
01:22:00,666 --> 01:22:04,216
我们只需要
最后一块拼图。
We just need
one final piece of the puzzle.

974
01:22:05,421 --> 01:22:07,549
干得好。
Well done.

975
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:12,682
历史自会做出评判的
History will stand in judgment.

976
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,352
不是我。你。
Not of me. Of you.

977
01:22:22,187 --> 01:22:23,439
怎么样了，JAYE？
What do we got, Jaye?

978
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:27,276
Zartan把重心都铺在这场核峰会上了
Zartan's entire focus
has been this nuclear summit.

979
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:29,036
这一定是他们计划的核心
It has to be the key
to whatever he's planning.

980
01:22:29,194 --> 01:22:31,367
好的。好吧，那么这就是我们的目标。
All right. Well, then that's our target.

981
01:22:32,030 --> 01:22:33,202
嗯。
Yeah.

982
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:36,373
伙计们，走。
Guys, move.

983
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,775
我觉得我速度比你快 蛇眼
I think I'm faster than you, Snake Eyes.

984
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:07,237
该死的忍者。
Damn Ninjas.

985
01:23:09,359 --> 01:23:10,906
很高兴见到你，兄弟。
Good to see you, brother.

986
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,492
JAYE。
Jaye.

987
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:14,072
金克斯。
Jinx.

988
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:18,752
都退后
Back up.

989
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:22,247
他是自己人
He's with us.

990
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:25,376
我不是自己人
I am not with you.

991
01:23:25,709 --> 01:23:27,382
但是，这一次，
But for this once,

992
01:23:27,878 --> 01:23:29,425
我不和你们作对
I am not against you.

993
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:31,052
他杀死我们的人有多少？
How many of our men has he killed?

994
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:33,221
和他并肩作战吧
We're supposed to fight with him?

995
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:41,400
大国首领们明天要汇聚一堂 这是一个陷阱。
The leaders of the world
will gather tomorrow. It's a trap.

996
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:43,610
风暴是唯一一个
知道眼镜蛇计划的人
Storm is the only one
who knows Cobra's plan

997
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:46,279
他可以帮助我们阻止计划。
inside and out.
He can help us find a way to stop it.

998
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,774
大家得精诚合作
But we have to work together.

999
01:23:53,862 --> 01:23:55,034
好的。
All right.

1000
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:57,870
行动。
Let's move.

1001
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:13,473
圣诞快乐。
Merry Christmas.

1002
01:24:15,634 --> 01:24:17,477
哇塞，还有你这样的邻居呀！
Makes you wonder
about your neighbours.

1003
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:31,487
漂亮
Nice.

1004
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:43,624
打开的沙发上。
Open up that couch.

1005
01:24:51,336 --> 01:24:52,804
什么？
Anything?

1006
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:55,091
我自己带。
I brought my own.

1007
01:24:57,009 --> 01:24:58,352
很好
Nice.

1008
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,622
就是它了
Yeah, that'll work.

1009
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,292
嘿。
Hey.

1010
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:25,458
这可是我的珍藏
That one's mine.

1011
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:28,465
这真的是巴顿将军的枪，是不是？
This really is Patton's gun, isn't it?

1012
01:25:29,291 --> 01:25:30,713
他们家族送我的。
Gift from his family.

1013
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:32,885
至高的荣耀
What an honour.

1014
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:34,804
的确是
You bet.

1015
01:25:36,798 --> 01:25:40,143
我倒是觉得你该找个与你块头相称的
I was actually thinking about
something a little more your size.

1016
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:47,150
尽量别刮伤了
Try not to scratch her up.

1017
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,979
挂空档时不太稳定
Idles a little rough in neutral.

1018
01:25:53,065 --> 01:25:54,908
我才不会挂空档呢
I ain't gonna be in neutral.

1019
01:25:55,651 --> 01:25:56,994
呼啊。
Hoo-ah.

1020
01:25:57,861 --> 01:25:59,283
你怎么样？
What about you?

1021
01:26:01,615 --> 01:26:04,289
国防部说
我不能出山。
DOD says
I can't come out of retirement.

1022
01:26:08,413 --> 01:26:10,836
可没规定我不能重新入伍
They didn't say anything
about reenlisting.

1023
01:26:14,336 --> 01:26:16,509
报告，军士长。
Reporting for duty, Sergeant Major.

1024
01:26:17,506 --> 01:26:19,258
还有几个朋友要加入进来
I'd like to bring a couple friends of mine.

1025
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:22,268
科尔顿的球队，
很荣幸和你们合作
Colton's team,
it's our honour.

1026
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:23,641
你们先负责外围
You guys take the perimeter.

1027
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,688
弗林特，JAYE，蛇眼，
你们从侧翼夹击。
Flint, Jaye, Snake,
you guys take the flank.

1028
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,525
金克斯和风暴，里外配合。
Jinx and Storm, Trojan Horse.

1029
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,853
Zartan会拿着公文包。
Zartan will be holding the briefcase.

1030
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,855
风暴将是他最亲密的人。
Storm will be the closest man to him.

1031
01:26:32,938 --> 01:26:35,532
但要等全员就位才能行动
But he can't move
until we're all in position.

1032
01:26:35,774 --> 01:26:37,321
所有人要盯紧目标
Everyone keep your eye on the prize.

1033
01:26:37,567 --> 01:26:39,911
保住了核心 就保住了全局
We secure the football,
we secure the world.

1034
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:42,539
蛇眼，你觉得呢
Snake, how's all that sound?

1035
01:26:43,115 --> 01:26:44,082
这就是我想的。
That's what I thought.

1036
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:45,158
好吧，等一下。
Okay, wait. Hold on a second.

1037
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:49,042
敌人布置装甲部队的方位
在这里，这里，和这里。
We still have enemy armour
here, here, and here.

1038
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,418
对吗？
Right?

1039
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,717
装甲车一过来 我们就完了
These tanks survive, we don't.

1040
01:26:55,460 --> 01:26:57,133
装甲车由我来对付
Leave the tanks to me.

1041
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:58,801
将军？
General?

1042
01:26:58,880 --> 01:26:59,972
叫我特种兵
Call me Joe.

1043
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,058
 - 我错过了什么？
 - 没有
- Anything I missed?
- No.

1044
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:05,144
滴水不漏 我的任务呢
Rock solid. My orders?

1045
01:27:05,637 --> 01:27:06,638
总统。营救总统
The President.

1046
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,475
 - 布伦达跟我一组。
 - 收到。
- Brenda's with my team.
- Roger that.

1047
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,312
布兰达有选择权吗
Does Brenda get a vote?

1048
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,652
没有。
Negative.

1049
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:17,323
你需要一支钢笔吗？
You need a pen?

1050
01:27:17,941 --> 01:27:19,488
我需要你的帮助。
I need your help.

1051
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,571
好的。
All right.

1052
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,656
让我们大干一场！呼啊！
Let's kick that ass! Hoo-ah!

1053
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:25,832
呼啊！
Hoo-ah!

1054
01:27:28,410 --> 01:27:29,832
一个历史性的日子
A historic day for

1055
01:27:29,911 --> 01:27:31,959
美国总统
他会见...
the President of the United States
as he meets with...

1056
01:27:32,038 --> 01:27:34,382
今天下午，
总统将会见
This afternoon, the
President is meeting with the leaders

1057
01:27:34,458 --> 01:27:35,880
8个核大国的领导人。
of the eight nuclear powers.

1058
01:27:35,959 --> 01:27:37,757
以前从未
有一个总统如此大胆
Never before
has a President been so bold

1059
01:27:37,961 --> 01:27:40,214
召集世界的领袖...
to call the leaders
of the world together...

1060
01:27:40,297 --> 01:27:42,015
这将是
前所未有的核谈判
These are
unprecedented nuclear talks

1061
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,512
大部分人感觉是出乎意料
that most believed would never happen.

1062
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:46,186
会议安全的问题一定是最高机密
You can bet security is
at its highest...

1063
01:27:46,511 --> 01:27:48,263
我们将进一步迈向前所未有的无核世界
We may be closer
to a nuclear-free world

1064
01:27:48,346 --> 01:27:49,939
比我们曾经去过。
than we have ever been.

1065
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:51,524
世界领导人们，
My fellow world leaders,

1066
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,353
欢迎来到
萨姆特堡，
welcome to the hallowed grounds
of Fort Sumter,

1067
01:27:54,811 --> 01:28:00,033
这些围墙见证我们国家的严重的内战的第一炮
whose proud walls saw the first shots
in our nation's grievous Civil War.

1068
01:28:00,692 --> 01:28:04,663
在这里，官兵疯狂地违背了原则
Here, men rushed through the breach
in a madness.

1069
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:08,534
好好反省错误吧
What better place to step back
from that same breach.

1070
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:11,040
放弃我们的阴暗的本性。
Renounce our darker natures.

1071
01:28:12,037 --> 01:28:14,381
原谅我们的敌人。
Forgive our staunchest foes.

1072
01:28:17,459 --> 01:28:19,461
这是个有象征意义的地方
This site is symbolic.

1073
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,719
我们寻求实现的和平
Not only for the peace
we seek to achieve,

1074
01:28:23,799 --> 01:28:27,349
避免战火
but the conflagration we seek to avoid.

1075
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:31,348
今天眼镜蛇保护我们
The Cobras who protect us today

1076
01:28:31,681 --> 01:28:35,276
他们有着比和平
are dedicated to the belief
that there is no greater peace

1077
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:36,895
更平和的心态。
than peace of mind.

1078
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,816
 - 谢谢你。
- Thank you.

1079
01:28:40,899 --> 01:28:42,401
我再说一遍。
I'll say it again.

1080
01:28:42,484 --> 01:28:45,237
世界因为有核武器才会变得更安全
The world is safer
with a nuclear presence.

1081
01:28:45,654 --> 01:28:48,828
我敢肯定，你的选民会很喜欢
我们的最终建议。
I'm sure your electorate will be happy
by our final proposal.

1082
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:52,586
到2016年减少50％。
50% reduction by 2016.

1083
01:28:55,163 --> 01:28:57,586
在场有很多国家的领袖
There are a lot of leaders in this room.

1084
01:28:58,667 --> 01:29:01,671
但是，只有一个自由世界的领导者。
But only one leader of the free world.

1085
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,513
而他，
And he,

1086
01:29:04,172 --> 01:29:06,345
就是我 请听我说
I, stay with me,

1087
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:11,939
我要求在场各位都能实现全面销毁核武器
asked you here with the goal
of universal disarmament.

1088
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:13,556
创造无核世界
Nuclear zero.

1089
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:18,521
我已经把好话都讲完了
Now, I was prepared
to cajole to get what I want.

1090
01:29:18,937 --> 01:29:20,689
现在我下硬指令
I'm now at threaten.

1091
01:29:21,773 --> 01:29:26,119
你们都要给我立即销毁库存核武器
Each of you will clear out
his nuclear closet immediately.

1092
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:30,707
假如没有做到的话 就会被认为是宣战的举动
Failure to participate
will be considered an act of war.

1093
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:32,876
你是在开玩笑，当然。
You're joking, of course.

1094
01:29:32,951 --> 01:29:34,453
本次峰会结束。
This summit is over.

1095
01:29:34,536 --> 01:29:35,628
那么这是什么。
Then this is it.

1096
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,293
可是先生们
This is it, boys.

1097
01:29:39,749 --> 01:29:41,751
这个国家向你们宣战
This country is at war.

1098
01:29:42,085 --> 01:29:46,135
你和你和你
你，你，你。
With you and you and you
and you and you and you.

1099
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:59,065
1组就位 1组开始行动
Delta team in position.
Echo, you're a go.

1100
01:29:59,644 --> 01:30:01,863
这里是1组 展开攻击
This is Echo. Beginning assault.

1101
01:30:04,816 --> 01:30:06,659
美国核武库
The U.S. nuclear arsenal

1102
01:30:06,943 --> 01:30:11,369
足以把你们每个国家毁灭14次
is capable of destroying
each of your countries 14 times over.

1103
01:30:11,448 --> 01:30:14,497
确切地说能毁灭北韩15次
Fifteen, in the case of North Korea,
just to be sure.

1104
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:16,669
这一切
And all

1105
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:20,924
只需要按下
at the push

1106
01:30:21,333 --> 01:30:22,380
一个按钮。
of a button.

1107
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:39,434
这可是真的呀！
It's true. Yeah!

1108
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:41,145
是啊，我按。
Yeah, I pressed it.

1109
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:42,645
你已经失去了你的心！
You have lost your mind!

1110
01:30:43,396 --> 01:30:45,069
这是相对的。
It's all relative.

1111
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,657
你有三分钟时间来决定。
You got three minutes to decide.

1112
01:30:49,945 --> 01:30:52,414
 - 戴上手表了吗？
 - 保持无线电静默。
- You got next watch?
- Maintain radio silence.

1113
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:14,561
我们不会同意 也不能再坐视不管了
We cannot, we will not leave
a legacy of acquiescence!

1114
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:16,308
 - 把公文包拿来。
- Bring the briefcase.

1115
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:25,739
不要这样做！
Don't do this!

1116
01:31:25,981 --> 01:31:27,403
可有没有赢家！
There can be no winners!

1117
01:31:31,277 --> 01:31:33,120
哦。高得分。
Ooh. High score.

1118
01:31:33,405 --> 01:31:37,911
让历史来见证吧 看由谁为这疯狂承担责任
Let history record
who was responsible for this madness.

1119
01:31:41,746 --> 01:31:43,168
发射。
Launch.

1120
01:32:02,642 --> 01:32:04,235
发射。
Launch.

1121
01:32:22,704 --> 01:32:24,001
看好翡翠城。
Eyes on the Emerald City.

1122
01:32:24,372 --> 01:32:27,296
JAYE、科尔顿
你们去找总统。
Jaye and Colton,
you're a go for POTUS.

1123
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:48,980
你没事吧？
You all right?

1124
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:51,157
嗯。你没事吧？
Yeah. You all right?

1125
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,993
我的胆固醇有点高。
My cholesterol's a little high.

1126
01:32:56,154 --> 01:32:58,327
Jaye和科尔顿。
岗哨搞定。
Jaye and General Colton.
Checkpoint neutralised.

1127
01:32:58,865 --> 01:33:00,333
这儿交给你了
You're on your own.

1128
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:16,175
哦 好消息是下个月不用再开全球气候变暖峰会了
Well, the good news is,
no global warming summit next month.

1129
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:18,852
除非
Unless

1130
01:33:19,177 --> 01:33:22,351
我们当中有人在乎他在历史上留下的地位
one of us cared enough
about his place in history

1131
01:33:22,680 --> 01:33:25,183
单方面关闭了他的弹头。
to unilaterally disable his warheads.

1132
01:33:25,558 --> 01:33:26,650
嗯？
Hmm?

1133
01:33:26,935 --> 01:33:28,278
为了子孙后代
You know, in the name of the children.

1134
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:30,359
有谁自愿
Any volunteers?

1135
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:32,361
没有 那好。
No? Fine.

1136
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:33,866
我。
Me.

1137
01:33:46,871 --> 01:33:49,044
打电话给你的人确认。
Call your people to confirm.

1138
01:33:49,207 --> 01:33:50,959
你是不是真的疯了
You're a complete lunatic.

1139
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,382
眼看就要摧毁亚洲。
Says the man about to destroy Asia.

1140
01:33:53,753 --> 01:33:55,175
来吧，
没人跟风？
Come on,
who's going to follow suit, huh?

1141
01:33:55,380 --> 01:33:58,805
你们真要打算眼睁睁地看着地球被毁灭掉吗
Are you really going to stand by
and watch as Earth is destroyed?

1142
01:33:59,050 --> 01:34:00,222
中止！
Abort!

1143
01:34:16,234 --> 01:34:18,236
我猜最后一个会是北韩
I figured North Korea for last.

1144
01:34:21,114 --> 01:34:22,866
我爱的小家伙。
Got to love the little guy.

1145
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:24,876
先生们
Gentlemen.

1146
01:34:25,201 --> 01:34:27,829
欢迎来到一个无核武器的世界。
Welcome to a nuclear-free world.

1147
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:34,757
我想请大家把注意力转移到自己祖国的实况画面上
I want to direct your attention
to live images of your homelands.

1148
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,680
现在，你们正在看到
一个先进的武器系统
Now, you're looking
at an advanced weapons system

1149
01:34:45,930 --> 01:34:47,603
我们称之为宙斯计划。
we call Project Zeus.

1150
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:52,320
有七个宙斯卫星
绕地球轨道。
There are seven Zeus satellites
orbiting Earth.

1151
01:34:52,770 --> 01:34:56,491
每颗卫星都带有
10个空心铂管
Each satellite contains
10 hollow platinum tubes

1152
01:34:56,649 --> 01:34:58,651
填充用钨棒。
filled with a tungsten rod.

1153
01:35:00,028 --> 01:35:02,281
宙斯卫星 目标A 锁定伦敦
Zeus satellite 1-A approaching London.

1154
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:06,034
坐标已经输入 进入投放程序
Ordnance live and loaded.
Awaiting drop authorisation.

1155
01:35:06,451 --> 01:35:10,831
为了让钨棒击中目标 我们根本无需发射
Now, to direct a rod to its target,
we don't launch it or fire it.

1156
01:35:11,164 --> 01:35:12,211
扔下去就是了
We drop it!

1157
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:19,885
剩下的事地心引力办
Gravity does the rest.

1158
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,643
好好看吧
Observe.

1159
01:35:27,347 --> 01:35:29,520
1-A卫星。
我们远程发射授权。
Satellite 1-A.
We have remote launch authorisation.

1160
01:35:29,641 --> 01:35:31,484
三，二，一，
Three, two, one,

1161
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:32,943
投放。
drop.

1162
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:42,321
钨棒落下的速度比子弹要快八倍
A rod touches down
eight times faster than a bullet.

1163
01:35:42,654 --> 01:35:46,158
而它的杀伤力则比核弹头要大得多了
And with a force significantly greater
than a nuclear warhead.

1164
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:50,499
不会产生辐射尘。
None of the fallout.

1165
01:35:51,371 --> 01:35:53,044
但会带来乐趣
All of the fun.

1166
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:17,648
你必须对此负责
You will have to
answer for this.

1167
01:36:18,147 --> 01:36:20,491
你的国会 你的最高法院 会放过你吗
To your Congress, your courts.

1168
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,370
错了 是他们要对我负责
Correction,
they will have to answer to me.

1169
01:36:24,570 --> 01:36:26,413
你想要的是什么呢？
What is it you want?

1170
01:36:29,158 --> 01:36:31,160
我想得到全部
I want it all.

1171
01:36:51,931 --> 01:36:56,186
眼镜蛇革命已经开始。
The Cobra revolution has begun.

1172
01:36:57,020 --> 01:37:01,867
只要我按下这个按钮
Zartan就会启动自动投射程序。
By pressing that button,
Zartan initiated an auto-drop sequence.

1173
01:37:02,942 --> 01:37:05,741
我宙斯卫星的
正在进入位置
My Zeus satellites
are moving into position

1174
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:07,618
向剩余的六个国家飞去
over your six remaining countries.

1175
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:10,784
卫星通过7-A 2-A
途中目标。
Satellites 2-A through 7-A
en route to targets.

1176
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:14,370
同一个按钮可以启动 也可以终止
The same button that begins this
can end it.

1177
01:37:15,038 --> 01:37:17,040
但对于交易我有个先决条件
But I only press it for a price.

1178
01:37:18,041 --> 01:37:20,385
把整个政权交给我
Total allegiance.

1179
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:32,435
路霸 解决外围的敌人
Block, secure the perimeter!

1180
01:37:50,365 --> 01:37:54,040
没什么比手提箱更重要 别让特种部队拿到
Get the control case from Zartan.
I'm going to drop them all.

1181
01:37:56,662 --> 01:37:59,006
去门那儿！走，走，走！
Head to the door! Go, go, go!

1182
01:38:29,821 --> 01:38:31,664
卫星正向目标前进。
Satellites en route to targets.

1183
01:38:31,823 --> 01:38:33,825
开始执行指令程序
Beginning command protocols.

1184
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,379
跟着队伍！去！
Follow that ground team! Go!

1185
01:39:22,540 --> 01:39:23,541
留下来。
Stay.

1186
01:39:38,514 --> 01:39:40,437
六点方向，两个眼镜蛇！
On your six, Cobra two!

1187
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,199
眼镜蛇，眼镜蛇之一，
我需要眼睛！眼睛！
Cobra one, Cobra one,
I need eyes on! Eyes on!

1188
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:10,547
该死的。
Damn it.

1189
01:40:18,262 --> 01:40:19,263
我们已经得到了她走投无路。
We've got her cornered.

1190
01:40:19,388 --> 01:40:21,106
她是不会去任何地方。
She ain't going anywhere.

1191
01:40:47,833 --> 01:40:48,834
去！
Go!

1192
01:41:12,817 --> 01:41:16,663
风暴。
我从来没有想过你会是特种队员。
Storm.
I never figured you for a Joe.

1193
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,827
我对你很失望。
I'm very disappointed in you.

1194
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:38,013
你是欠扁的。
You're a bitch to hit.

1195
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:34,398
叛徒。
Traitor.

1196
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:40,029
风暴。
Storm.

1197
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,662
你知道，这把宝剑
从来没有打算
You know, this sword
was never intended

1198
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:46,210
对任何人愤怒。
for anyone
with anger management issues.

1199
01:43:01,759 --> 01:43:02,931
轰！
Boom!

1200
01:43:12,603 --> 01:43:14,276
 - 那是什么？
 - 闭嘴。
- What was that?
- Shut up.

1201
01:43:20,695 --> 01:43:22,038
雷 - ？
 - 是的，先生。
- Ray?
- Yes, sir.

1202
01:43:22,113 --> 01:43:23,615
检查门。汇报情况。
Check the door. Give me a sit rep.

1203
01:43:23,698 --> 01:43:24,745
我就可以了。
I'm on it.

1204
01:43:40,005 --> 01:43:41,382
你们两个守住入口。
You two secure the entrance.

1205
01:44:03,738 --> 01:44:05,490
 - 你在做什么？
 - 让我们去。我们离开这里。
- What are you doing?
- Let's go. We're out of here.

1206
01:44:06,741 --> 01:44:08,584
站了下来。我要毙了他！
Stand down. I'm gonna shoot him!

1207
01:44:09,577 --> 01:44:11,079
我说退下！
I said stand down!

1208
01:44:12,747 --> 01:44:16,172
既然是特种部队的 就把枪放下 让我们出去
Be a good G.I. Joe and drop the gun.
We're walking out of here.

1209
01:44:16,542 --> 01:44:18,044
我会打爆他的头
你明白我的意思吗？
I will shoot him in the head.
Do you understand me?

1210
01:44:18,252 --> 01:44:20,004
你不听，是吗？
把枪放下！
You're not listening, are you?
Put the gun down!

1211
01:44:20,171 --> 01:44:21,263
把枪放下
Drop it!

1212
01:44:29,930 --> 01:44:31,273
放松 放松
Easy, easy.

1213
01:44:32,183 --> 01:44:33,605
压住伤口
Put some pressure on it.

1214
01:44:33,809 --> 01:44:35,231
将军科尔顿。
General Colton.

1215
01:44:35,561 --> 01:44:37,154
这是很高兴见到你。
 - 很高兴见到你。
-It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

1216
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:39,322
- 对不起 总统先生 - 没关系
- Sorry, Mr President.
- No, it's fine.

1217
01:44:39,607 --> 01:44:40,950
来吧。让我们继续前进。
Come on. Let's move.

1218
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:42,239
在这里，我们走了。
Here we go.

1219
01:44:42,735 --> 01:44:45,204
路霸 第一任务完成 没有伤亡。
Roadblock, POTUS secure.
No casualties.

1220
01:44:47,865 --> 01:44:48,866
收到 珍
