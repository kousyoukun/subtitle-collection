1
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,653
- Okay Ned,
you've got 90 minutes.

2
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:24,890
Any subject you like,
time starts now.

3
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,899
- We all have one
thing we're ashamed of.

4
00:00:33,901 --> 00:00:37,269
The memory of one
moment so embarrassing

5
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:39,538
we don't think we'll
ever get over it.

6
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:43,776
A moment that still wakes
us at four A.M. sweating.

7
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,546
My terrible moment happened
because I was afraid,

8
00:00:47,548 --> 00:00:49,815
I was afraid because I
lost the only true friend

9
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:51,650
I'd ever known.

10
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:54,453
People do bad
things out of fear.

11
00:01:01,594 --> 00:01:06,231
For me, the good life ended
when mum died a few years back.

12
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:08,167
Suddenly, dad married Natalie.

13
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:10,903
They were living in Dubai
and I was in boarding school

14
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:12,404
in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,040
A school where rugby
was a religion.

16
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,942
Where I was persecuted daily.

17
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:18,343
I mean, legally you
guys shouldn't be able

18
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,112
to force me to go to school.

19
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:22,014
Legally I'm basically an adult.

20
00:01:22,016 --> 00:01:24,183
- You're basically an adult
but you're actually like 16.

21
00:01:24,185 --> 00:01:26,819
- Yes, 16 is your actual age.

22
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:28,053
Which is why the
idea of us letting

23
00:01:28,055 --> 00:01:29,855
you leave school is absurd.

24
00:01:29,857 --> 00:01:31,957
- So you're pretty much
sending me to jail?

25
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:34,560
- Even prisoners make
an effort to fit in.

26
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:38,597
They do jigsaws together, play
ping pong with each other.

27
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,766
- Could you please
listen to yourself

28
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:42,301
for the briefest of moments?

29
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,535
- Excuse me?

30
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:45,104
- Ned, conforming is
part of being a grown up

31
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:46,872
and letting you leave school
early would be sending

32
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,707
you to jail in a way.

33
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:50,843
Boys that leave school at
your age doom themselves

34
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,078
to a life of sweeping
up supermarket floors.

35
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,413
- Dad was obsessed with

36
00:01:54,415 --> 00:01:56,115
the guys who swept
supermarket floors.

37
00:01:56,117 --> 00:01:57,950
- And then crime, naturally.

38
00:01:57,952 --> 00:02:00,119
Natalie, Adam Quinn's
boy, he was expelled

39
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,654
from school last year, now
apparently, he's a bum in Paris.

40
00:02:02,656 --> 00:02:04,156
- No way, really?

41
00:02:04,158 --> 00:02:07,392
- Yes, reading his poetry
on the Metro for money.

42
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:10,229
Practically begging,
it's desperately sad.

43
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:11,997
So just think about that.

44
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:14,099
- A bum in Paris.

45
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:15,834
I would've loved that.

46
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:18,403
But was I bad enough
to get expelled?

47
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:20,072
This year would tell.

48
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,323
Have my own room, magical.

49
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:47,192
- Did you just say you
have your own room?

50
00:03:47,194 --> 00:03:48,827
No way, let me see.

51
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,430
Oh.

52
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:54,166
- Ladies and gentlemen,
my tormenter in chief.

53
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:55,234
- Okay.

54
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:58,604
Maybe the reason you
have your own room

55
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,573
is so nobody gets
bummed, you know,

56
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:03,242
in the middle of the night.

57
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,377
- And hello to you too weasel.

58
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,812
I trust the summer
treated you well.

59
00:04:06,814 --> 00:04:11,083
- I trust the summer
treated you well.

60
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:14,052
Oh, you are an utter bender.

61
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,322
- Weasel, you fucking ledge,
I haven't seen you in ages.

62
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,390
- Alright.

63
00:04:19,325 --> 00:04:21,893
- Back to jail
and just like prison,

64
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:24,429
if nobody likes
who you really are,

65
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:28,433
then buddy, you better
hide yourself away.

66
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:31,203
Here's an example,
for English essays,

67
00:04:31,205 --> 00:04:33,372
I stole the lyrics
from obscure songs,

68
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:36,675
the very old Mr. Fatrell
would never know.

69
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:38,377
But it was a private joke.

70
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:40,312
But nobody else knew the songs

71
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,281
or cared one way or the other.

72
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:45,617
Everyone at Woodhill college
was obsessed with rugby.

73
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,519
And I didn't hate
rugby but what happened

74
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,221
if you didn't love it?

75
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,726
Yeah, that sound means gay.

76
00:04:55,528 --> 00:04:57,896
I have no idea why it means that

77
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,732
but believe me,
I heard it a lot.

78
00:05:01,901 --> 00:05:03,335
I should explain.

79
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:07,472
Gay means crap,
bad, or different

80
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,608
and the fear of being
in any way different

81
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,678
ran through our school
from top to bottom.

82
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,180
- Ask the lady to dance
and then, you know,

83
00:05:15,182 --> 00:05:18,517
you get into a sort of a,
member it's kind of that

84
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:21,186
but do not do that, okay.

85
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,854
So any questions?

86
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,424
- There were other
kinds of schools, of course.

87
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:28,493
Cool, modern day schools
where anything went.

88
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:29,628
But not here.

89
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:37,102
- Today, we're gonna
be looking at...

90
00:05:37,104 --> 00:05:39,071
- talking about sexual identity

91
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:42,441
to anyone in our school, that
was like staring at the sun.

92
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:45,010
- Have you any idea?

93
00:05:47,715 --> 00:05:49,481
- It seemed, you
could be whoever you liked

94
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,683
out in the world.

95
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,294
But our school wasn't
a part of the world.

96
00:06:02,296 --> 00:06:05,097
- Firstly, some sad news.

97
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:07,733
After a short illness
our dear colleague

98
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:11,136
and friend, Glen
Fatrell, has passed on.

99
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,077
Units, which will
mean some reshuffling

100
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,146
in the English department.

101
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,316
In honor of our recently
deceased English teacher,

102
00:06:24,318 --> 00:06:26,318
one victorious
student will be chosen

103
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,053
to represent the school in

104
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,756
the national essay
writing competition.

105
00:06:30,758 --> 00:06:33,925
There is a first
prize of five grand.

106
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,266
As a donation to the school.

107
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,236
Now, rugby.

108
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:52,811
- Did you ever
meet an adult who wishes

109
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,312
they were a kid again?

110
00:06:54,314 --> 00:06:57,048
That was our headmaster, Walter.

111
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:04,456
- This school has
won 17 senior cups.

112
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:10,595
But it has been a long
decade since the last.

113
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:14,466
We have a fine crop of players.

114
00:07:14,468 --> 00:07:18,703
The entire school needs to
support our fantastic coach,

115
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,842
Mr. Pascal O'keefe.

116
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:27,913
- As for this guy, rumor
had it Pascal's wife left him

117
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:31,249
because he was too
obsessed with rugby.

118
00:07:32,985 --> 00:07:36,655
And that, that's the guy
who changed everything.

119
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:43,195
- Guys, guys.

120
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:57,108
- Now young man, before we
show your mother your digs,

121
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:59,945
I need you to
promise me something,

122
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:01,146
I'm told you left
your old school

123
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,782
for repeated and
persistent fighting?

124
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:05,217
We're happy to
educate you as long

125
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:09,421
as that kind of behavior remains
in your past, understood?

126
00:08:09,423 --> 00:08:10,489
Follow me.

127
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:15,961
Get out of that bin Kennedy
and seize egregious playing.

128
00:08:15,963 --> 00:08:18,263
- Yes sir, because
it's all my fault.

129
00:08:18,265 --> 00:08:19,898
- Apology accepted.

130
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,535
Now coach Pascal O'keefe
is a former pupil.

131
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,038
We've a fantastic crop
of players this year.

132
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,106
Men, Sonny.

133
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,010
Just one more till to the title.

134
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,080
Training starts tomorrow,
do not be late for Pascal.

135
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:37,382
Nice boy called
Ned is this room.

136
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,284
Parents live in Dubai.

137
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,192
- What sort of a boy is Ned?

138
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,860
- Veracious reader.

139
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:56,468
Well, I'll leave you
to say your farewells.

140
00:09:01,073 --> 00:09:02,941
- Honey I'm sorry your
dad didn't make it.

141
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:04,676
He wanted to, he was just...

142
00:09:04,678 --> 00:09:06,077
- drunk?

143
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:07,312
- He's busy, he's
incredibly busy with work,

144
00:09:07,314 --> 00:09:10,782
you know how hard he
works, he's flat out.

145
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,387
Just a hug.

146
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:38,677
- Are you okay, miss?

147
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,960
Give me a second.

148
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,899
I can't share with
a guy like him.

149
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:02,834
- Ned, Ned, Ned.

150
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,570
You know, my time on the
boy scouts as a young man

151
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,706
was rewarding on so many levels.

152
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:09,975
Beaver whacking, orienteering,

153
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,044
the nautical art
of making knots.

154
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:15,013
And although I may not
be able to remember how

155
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:19,017
to fashion a round turn
and two half hitches,

156
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:21,152
I will never forget the
lasting bond of friendship

157
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,520
that ensued.

158
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:24,756
- Sir, the Geneva convention.

159
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:26,725
- My decision is final.

160
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:29,928
Leave.

161
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,700
- Yes, this was a
blow but it wasn't

162
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,502
as if the rugby team
would be congregating

163
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:38,870
in my bedroom.

164
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,105
- We heard you were coming.

165
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,807
Yes, you're younger
than us but Pascal says,

166
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,044
if you're good enough,
you're old enough.

167
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:50,048
- Look, Conor, this is the
last year for this dream team,

168
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,916
alright, we all
leave in the summer,

169
00:10:51,918 --> 00:10:53,218
I've been captain twice

170
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,021
and I'll never compete
again, unfortunately,

171
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:59,924
so we have to end
this thing this year.

172
00:10:59,926 --> 00:11:01,693
If I'm being honest
with you, I don't think

173
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:04,562
the chance is gonna come
around again for this school.

174
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:07,298
- Training starts tomorrow, six.

175
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:12,604
Do not be late, do not be
late, seriously, big no no.

176
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,908
- This is your roommate.

177
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,678
I was really starting
to wonder for a second.

178
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,614
I mean, this is a picture
of two guys wearing

179
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,849
the face off each other, Conor.

180
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,151
I mean, really.

181
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:27,719
- That's not mine.

182
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:32,957
- Touch me, homo and
I call rape, okay.

183
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,194
- Jesus.

184
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,595
- Weasel, give it a rest.

185
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:38,963
- Conor, you're gonna have

186
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,599
to seriously consider
moving rooms, okay?

187
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:43,401
You're gonna get aids in here.

188
00:11:43,403 --> 00:11:45,603
We cannot have a
teammate giving us aids

189
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:46,771
in the middle of a scrum.

190
00:11:46,773 --> 00:11:48,173
- Yeah, I'm not
totally sure that's how

191
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,541
the HIV virus is transmitted.

192
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:50,842
- Go fuck yourself, Spainer.

193
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:54,813
And as for you, you just
made weasel's shit list.

194
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,492
- Coming?

195
00:12:24,143 --> 00:12:25,410
- You were wondering
if there's another room

196
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,911
you could sleep in?

197
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,547
But what's wrong with the
room that you already have?

198
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:30,782
- My roommate.

199
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,757
As a new boy, it
can be, it can be...

200
00:12:46,532 --> 00:12:47,532
- It can be what?

201
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:49,601
- It's just, you can be.

202
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:54,939
- Go back to your room Conor.

203
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,007
Good man.

204
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:12,991
- The Berlin wall
was built overnight.

205
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:14,659
The world woke up
the morning after

206
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:15,994
and there it was.

207
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:18,263
Now, I'm no communist
but there's a lot

208
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:21,099
to be said for
acting decisively.

209
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,467
- Did you know lizards
can regrow their tails?

210
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:59,404
That's how it was in our
school with English teacher.

211
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:01,739
One dies, another
grows in it's place.

212
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:02,807
No big deal.

213
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,816
- Darren Finnigan.

214
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,855
Did you make that absurd noise?

215
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:25,263
Age 16, birthday June,
shoe size eight and a half,

216
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:31,502
fan of formula one car
racing, allergic to milk

217
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,106
and therefore all dairy, surely.

218
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:40,478
Father, management consultant,
mother stay at home mom,

219
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:47,819
bed wetter, I'd imagine,
and a coward for sure.

220
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,688
Congratulations Mr. Finnigan,
you are today's winner

221
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:54,158
of the witless tool
competition, be gone.

222
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,165
Anyone else?

223
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,905
No?

224
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,375
Good.

225
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:13,778
How did I look at that
stuff about Darren?

226
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,846
I read it.

227
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:20,218
And I read about each and
every one of you similarly.

228
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,657
There is no limit to what
you can learn from reading.

229
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:33,064
And with that in mind, I'm
assigning you an essay,

230
00:15:33,066 --> 00:15:35,133
the essay is due on Friday

231
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:39,037
and the title of the
essay is a family member.

232
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:42,907
And before you consider how dull

233
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,810
and how asinine the
title of that essay is,

234
00:15:45,812 --> 00:15:48,279
let me tell you that I'm aware
how dull and asinine it is

235
00:15:48,281 --> 00:15:51,616
and I want to own the dullness.

236
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:53,785
Reveal to me who you are.

237
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:57,422
If you dare.

238
00:15:59,992 --> 00:16:03,528
In the meantime, we're going
to be reading lord of the flies

239
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,731
by Golding, a cautionary
tale about giving power

240
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:10,969
to an impressionable mass of
fragrant and unkempt urchins.

241
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:14,072
Not that that's every
gonna happen in my class.

242
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:16,975
Okay, books open
please, page one.

243
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,513
- The boy with fair hair
lowered himself down

244
00:16:22,515 --> 00:16:24,282
the last few feet of
the rock and began

245
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,384
to pick his way
toward the lagoon.

246
00:16:26,386 --> 00:16:28,086
Though he'd taken
off of school sweater

247
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,620
and trailed it
now from one hand,

248
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,023
his gray shirt stuck to him.

249
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:36,794
- Go away, thank you.

250
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:40,331
- Woah.

251
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:45,470
- Sorry, sir, I thought
you were a pupil.

252
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,373
- No.

253
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,077
What's with the Berlin wall?

254
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:55,546
- It's a matter of necessity.

255
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,016
- Right, who's your roommate?

256
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,719
- Oh honestly, I don't know.

257
00:17:02,821 --> 00:17:05,590
- Right well I've
got a delivery for.

258
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:11,362
No way you can make
him feel welcome, no?

259
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,830
- Yeah, see, he's
a rugby player so,

260
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:15,133
believe me, my friendship
would be a hindrance.

261
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:18,136
- That's quite a persecution
complex you got going on there.

262
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:19,704
- Thank you.

263
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,105
- You gonna let
me hear something?

264
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,474
- Well, I can't play
and even if I could,

265
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,344
I don't think I'd play
anything that you'd like.

266
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:28,246
- Just play something.

267
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:44,262
- Okay, so that's d.

268
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,329
- That's d.

269
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,501
- Is d your only...

270
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:51,536
- d is my only chord, yeah.

271
00:17:51,538 --> 00:17:53,271
- I see, okay well,

272
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:57,075
lift the finger up to
that one, higher there.

273
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,510
Yep, now play.

274
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,782
Now you know another chord.

275
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,018
See you.

276
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,973
- Sir, I'm really really
sorry, I know I'm late,

277
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,641
it's just, I couldn't
find my boots,

278
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:32,143
I thought I put them in my bag

279
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,811
and I thought my bag was in
my classroom but I left...

280
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,146
- Conor, relax.

281
00:18:36,548 --> 00:18:38,549
You're new, it happens.

282
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:42,653
The lads are running drills
out there, get ready,

283
00:18:42,655 --> 00:18:44,188
I'll go out with you.

284
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,857
Get you introduced.

285
00:18:49,061 --> 00:18:51,295
Once you cross that
white line, Conor,

286
00:18:51,297 --> 00:18:55,032
I want you to concentrate
on just one thing.

287
00:18:55,834 --> 00:18:57,335
Express yourself.

288
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:01,506
Good to go?

289
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:02,573
- Yeah.

290
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,342
- After you.

291
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,056
Everyone, this is Conor.

292
00:19:20,292 --> 00:19:21,792
Conor won the junior cup

293
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:25,663
at st Barts last year kicking
19 points in the final, huh?

294
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:28,499
I asked him up with
the seniors so he sees

295
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,136
what we're made of, give
him something to aspire to.

296
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,605
Also, give Wallace a
bit of competition.

297
00:19:34,607 --> 00:19:36,040
You've met our captain Victor,

298
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,675
apart from him, far too
many names to remember

299
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:38,976
but I'll give you the gist.

300
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:40,978
Key Chafrey, prop.

301
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,314
Tom Quillin, current
place kicker.

302
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:46,083
We get our speed
from this fellow.

303
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:47,818
Scrum half one, two.

304
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:51,522
Chief wrecking ball.

305
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,960
Okay, line out, first
against seconds,

306
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57,795
Conor, play a 10 for the first.

307
00:19:57,797 --> 00:20:00,331
Wallace, where's Wally?

308
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:01,999
- I'm here.

309
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,067
- Defend it.

310
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,672
- Don't worry about
it, I got you.

311
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,365
- You're an animal.

312
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:36,701
Monster.

313
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:41,706
Wallace, come back in for Conor.

314
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,441
Conor, take a break.

315
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,677
- Take a break.

316
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:48,579
We've only just begun.

317
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:51,449
- Okay, reset!

318
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:31,122
- Is it broken?

319
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,791
- Of course it's fucking broken.

320
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,394
- Well done lads,
yeah good play.

321
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,995
Don't worry about that weasel.

322
00:21:37,997 --> 00:21:40,464
You never were a looker.

323
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:42,867
Anyone see Conor masters?

324
00:21:42,869 --> 00:21:44,535
- He never came in.

325
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,420
- Tell me who you are.

326
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:05,756
I set an essay title for you

327
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,358
because I wanted to
find out about you

328
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,061
and there were some
excellent essays

329
00:22:10,063 --> 00:22:14,031
but there was one that
stood out above all.

330
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:15,099
Ned wrote.

331
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:19,070
Do you wanna get up here and
read it in front of the class?

332
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,472
- I'm actually okay, thanks.

333
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:27,511
I mean, thank you but
I'd just prefer not to.

334
00:22:27,513 --> 00:22:29,246
- I appreciate that.

335
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,718
But I think you should.

336
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:40,391
The next person to make
a single solitary sound

337
00:22:40,393 --> 00:22:43,294
of any sort is in
hideous trouble.

338
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,330
Go ahead, Ned.

339
00:23:03,181 --> 00:23:04,749
- A family member.

340
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,586
I have this cousin
who's name's Kevin

341
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:11,255
and I'm pretty sure he's
destined for heaven.

342
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,657
He's always spotlessly dressed,

343
00:23:13,659 --> 00:23:16,861
clean and neat and
totally smooth.

344
00:23:16,863 --> 00:23:19,997
He likes to wear this
fur-lined sheepskin jacket.

345
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,137
- Keep going, please.

346
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:31,041
- Kevin, start the same.

347
00:23:31,043 --> 00:23:32,610
My perfect cousin.

348
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:38,416
He doesn't, he's his
father's pride and joy.

349
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:43,521
His brother's little gone boy.

350
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,963
He thinks I'm bit of a coward

351
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,131
cause I universally...

352
00:23:54,133 --> 00:23:56,066
- stop, stop, stop.

353
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,134
Sit down.

354
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:13,284
Listen to you, the baying crowd.

355
00:24:13,286 --> 00:24:15,019
Behaving like sheep.

356
00:24:16,822 --> 00:24:20,991
Why do you assume that
this lesson isn't for you?

357
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:28,199
Never, ever, ever
use a borrowed voice.

358
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:36,907
You're all individual.

359
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,646
Stop, stop!

360
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:49,220
You spend your whole
life being someone else,

361
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:50,888
who's gonna be you?

362
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,126
Get out.

363
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:30,928
- Turn it down?

364
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:32,263
- No, not that.

365
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,936
Today, that was pretty cool.

366
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:40,771
I like the song.

367
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,274
- Could you go straight
to hell please?

368
00:25:43,276 --> 00:25:44,942
- I liked it a lot.

369
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:50,180
Why do you like
so much old stuff?

370
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:53,951
- Well because modern
life is rubbish.

371
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:55,185
- I hear that.

372
00:26:03,328 --> 00:26:05,496
- So I saw weasel's face.

373
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:07,965
- How'd you know I did that?

374
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,601
- Word gets around, even to me.

375
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,108
- Can I ask you a question?

376
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,546
It's personal.

377
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:31,121
Are you gay?

378
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,559
- Don't worry Conor, I'm not gonna
bum you in the night or any...

379
00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:36,927
- no, sorry, I'm sorry...

380
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,462
- was that it?

381
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,398
That was your question, was it?

382
00:26:56,548 --> 00:27:01,352
- It's not really the
music, it's more the story.

383
00:27:01,354 --> 00:27:03,387
How someone can write
about themselves like that,

384
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,624
about their family,
it's mad isn't it?

385
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:10,861
- Well yeah, the
madder, the better.

386
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:26,377
So you're not just
taking the piss?

387
00:27:28,413 --> 00:27:29,980
- I like the song.

388
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,351
- Well follow me then.

389
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:04,615
- Didn't know this was here.

390
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,584
- Found these last year.

391
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,420
- Vinyl.

392
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,558
Look at those faces,
what were they thinking?

393
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,326
- Well, none of them
ever cared about

394
00:28:16,328 --> 00:28:20,164
the stuff that matters
here, that's for sure.

395
00:28:24,903 --> 00:28:27,905
And I can't wait
to get out of here.

396
00:28:27,907 --> 00:28:29,306
- What are you gonna be?

397
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,241
- I am basically unemployable.

398
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,177
But I'll be free.

399
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:36,580
- My dad and I used to
sail that before he,

400
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,149
before he became
interested in other things.

401
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,218
I remember sitting at
the front of the boat,

402
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,221
that felt free, like flying.

403
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,889
- You still got the boat?

404
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:48,258
- It's still there, I
think, rusting away.

405
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,396
- So what's it like to
punch someone in the face?

406
00:28:54,432 --> 00:28:56,633
Woah, show me that, how
do you know a chord?

407
00:28:56,635 --> 00:28:59,837
- I can like music, you
know, we're not all the same.

408
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:02,039
- So you on his shit list?

409
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:07,177
- I think you've been
taken off that list.

410
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,099
- I never knew I'd been
lonely until I found a friend.

411
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:31,568
Not that Conor and I
were peas in a pod.

412
00:29:31,570 --> 00:29:33,504
I mean, I never met someone
who liked to run around

413
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:37,741
as much as I liked to sit
down and do nothing at all.

414
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:41,178
My defenses were coming down

415
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,415
and I'd never say it out
loud but it felt pretty good.

416
00:29:46,985 --> 00:29:48,919
Weasel had suddenly
stopped bullying me

417
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:52,489
and I no longer dreamed
of being expelled.

418
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:56,126
Despite my best
intentions, I began to feel

419
00:29:56,128 --> 00:29:57,361
like I fit in.

420
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,130
Four packs.

421
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,198
- Yep.

422
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,433
What happened?

423
00:30:03,435 --> 00:30:04,635
- I was pocketed.

424
00:30:04,637 --> 00:30:05,836
- Again?

425
00:30:05,838 --> 00:30:07,771
How many times is
that since September?

426
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:09,339
- Three, no, four.

427
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:13,610
Yeah, how many have you had?

428
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:15,345
- I've never been pocketed.

429
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,713
- You've never been pocketed?

430
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:18,749
- I've never been pocketed.

431
00:30:18,751 --> 00:30:21,018
- That's not right.

432
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,086
Anyway, this is for you.

433
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:26,089
- What is it?

434
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,325
- Birthday present.

435
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,393
- Really?

436
00:30:30,595 --> 00:30:33,864
- Yeah, well, I wasn't gonna
get you anything obviously

437
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:35,966
but my wicked step mother
said, seeing as you're

438
00:30:35,968 --> 00:30:38,602
a roommate and all, you
know, probably should.

439
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:40,070
It's a harmonica.

440
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,907
- Thanks Ned.

441
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:46,577
- Oh I have one more
present for you actually.

442
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,644
Yeah.

443
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:51,348
- You wouldn't dare.

444
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,816
- Wouldn't I, though?

445
00:30:52,818 --> 00:30:53,884
- Ned.

446
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,187
- Have a good birthday.

447
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,656
- Bastard.

448
00:31:04,295 --> 00:31:06,797
- Alas, poor Yorick.

449
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,934
- I knew him, Horatio, a
fellow of infinite jest.

450
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:16,540
- Mr. Sherry began
to work with us as a team.

451
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,942
And we all loved him for it.

452
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,849
Still, when an annual
variety show was announced

453
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:29,920
at the local girl's school,
no one stuck their hand up.

454
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,455
But Sherry had heard
us messing around

455
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:35,158
on those old guitars
and said, no, insisted,

456
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:38,896
that Conor and I
should play a song.

457
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:50,774
- Hi fellas, how's it going?

458
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:53,810
- Extremely bad
- awful, thanks.

459
00:31:53,812 --> 00:31:55,279
- And why is that?

460
00:31:55,281 --> 00:31:58,081
- Well, we're not these
deadly Spanish guitar players,

461
00:31:58,083 --> 00:31:59,917
we can't do an instrumental.

462
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,887
We have to do a song but neither
of us wanna be the singer.

463
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:04,922
- I'm definitely not doing it.

464
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:06,223
- No, me neither.

465
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:07,991
- And why not the both of you?

466
00:32:07,993 --> 00:32:11,161
- What, like Simon
and Garfunkel?

467
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:14,731
- Yeah, like Simon
and Garfunkel.

468
00:32:14,733 --> 00:32:16,300
- I don't think so.

469
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,035
- Not cool enough
for you Ned now?

470
00:32:18,037 --> 00:32:21,004
- Honestly, no, not really.

471
00:32:21,006 --> 00:32:23,974
- Why, you young man
need to learn about

472
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:27,144
what is much more
important than cool

473
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,379
and that is...

474
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:36,887
What is beautiful.

475
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:01,712
- High low.

476
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,550
- Oh but sir, it's so high.

477
00:33:06,552 --> 00:33:07,617
- So high.

478
00:33:09,053 --> 00:33:10,554
- Don't gock, Mr.

479
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,759
- Conor, training,
10 minutes man.

480
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:16,827
Come on.

481
00:33:26,037 --> 00:33:27,104
- Yes!

482
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,140
- The school rugby team embarked

483
00:33:30,142 --> 00:33:32,209
a long unbeaten win.

484
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:35,412
The local papers put
it down to my friend,

485
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,314
the new star out-half.

486
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,919
The players worshiped Pascal.

487
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:47,557
- Number nine, congratulations.

488
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,860
You have an
announcement to make?

489
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:51,528
- No.
- Yeah, you do.

490
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,529
- No.

491
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:53,830
- You do.

492
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:55,265
Come on number nine.

493
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:57,634
Everybody, I just noticed
number nine tackling

494
00:33:57,636 --> 00:33:59,102
and it's clear that
he has something else

495
00:33:59,104 --> 00:34:00,704
on his mind so I'm guessing it's

496
00:34:00,706 --> 00:34:02,873
because you and your
boyfriend are engaged

497
00:34:02,875 --> 00:34:06,443
to be married.

498
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:11,348
The hell are you doing
breastfeeding the tacklebag?

499
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,416
Hit it.

500
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:19,322
You afraid to be hit?

501
00:34:19,324 --> 00:34:21,191
Go sign up for the school opera.

502
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:23,727
I'm sure they're short
a few tavern wenches.

503
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,695
Everyone, gather round.

504
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:28,932
Time to get serious.

505
00:34:32,637 --> 00:34:34,371
It is the nature of the
school that you hear

506
00:34:34,373 --> 00:34:36,473
a lot of talk about
opening your mind

507
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:40,010
and the value of a
rounded education.

508
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:41,545
Bullshit.

509
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:44,114
We're about to walk
onto a battle field.

510
00:34:44,116 --> 00:34:45,882
And once we do, the
last thing we need

511
00:34:45,884 --> 00:34:50,220
is empathy for our fellow
man, to be feeling things.

512
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,656
Conor is leading us
out and he will have

513
00:34:52,658 --> 00:34:54,491
a target on his back.

514
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:56,526
So from now on, men,

515
00:34:56,528 --> 00:34:59,729
you're not a team,
it's a war zone

516
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,698
and you're in the army.

517
00:35:14,545 --> 00:35:15,812
- Shouldn't you be asleep?

518
00:35:15,814 --> 00:35:17,214
- Shouldn't you?

519
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,384
- I'm not the one playing in
the quarter final tomorrow.

520
00:35:21,386 --> 00:35:23,653
- That is why I'm not sleeping.

521
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:25,455
- I can't, me nerves.

522
00:35:26,557 --> 00:35:28,425
- You're gonna win.

523
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,693
- You don't know that.

524
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,128
- I don't know the
first thing about rugby

525
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,363
but I feel it in my bones.

526
00:35:38,002 --> 00:35:40,003
- Are you gonna be there?

527
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:42,239
- It's not really my team.

528
00:35:46,744 --> 00:35:50,447
This one time,
before you came here,

529
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:54,684
one of your teammates flushed
my head down the toilet.

530
00:35:56,287 --> 00:36:00,223
So that is not going
on my autobiography.

531
00:36:00,225 --> 00:36:02,559
You're better off without me.

532
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:05,362
I will be rooting
for you though.

533
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:09,966
- Single file,
gentlemen, single file.

534
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,992
- Conor, your old
man's out at the bar,

535
00:36:35,994 --> 00:36:37,594
says he wants to
buy us all a drink.

536
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,601
- Watch out, coming through.

537
00:36:44,603 --> 00:36:48,538
Coming through, coming
through, here we are.

538
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,173
Watch yourself boys.

539
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:51,408
Help yourself.

540
00:36:56,247 --> 00:36:58,582
Have a drink with
your old man, son.

541
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,817
- Fine with water, thanks.

542
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,989
- We can't toast the victory
without a man's drink, huh?

543
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,294
To my son, the athlete.

544
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,330
And to all you fine young men.

545
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,397
Cheers.

546
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,705
- Conor later told
me that if he hadn't had

547
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:25,842
that first drink, his night
would've ended very differently.

548
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,543
- Your dad is a
complete inspiration.

549
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,179
- Best thing about
watching you play today

550
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:07,384
was realizing that all that
rubbish in the last school

551
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:09,185
was just rubbish.

552
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:12,555
That was the real
you today, huh?

553
00:38:12,557 --> 00:38:14,658
I loved you today.

554
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:16,226
I loved you again.

555
00:38:17,561 --> 00:38:20,563
You felt like my son again.

556
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:22,799
Not that shit from before.

557
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,902
Now come on, jump in and I'll
give you a lift back, huh?

558
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,537
We'll have a chats.

559
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,540
- I'm getting the train.

560
00:38:37,882 --> 00:38:38,948
- Son...

561
00:38:44,922 --> 00:38:46,389
- After walking
for hours, I found

562
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:48,425
a cinema showing a
subtitled film about

563
00:38:48,427 --> 00:38:50,260
a nun which was long.

564
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:56,733
I ended up late for the
coaches back to school

565
00:38:56,735 --> 00:38:58,668
and that's when I saw Conor.

566
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,971
The idea was that I
would surprise him.

567
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:31,034
- Far too young, sorry pal.

568
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,869
- He's my friend.

569
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,771
- He's older than you.

570
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:37,941
- What kind of bar is this?

571
00:39:37,943 --> 00:39:39,476
- A bar for adults.

572
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,878
- Okay, what kind of adults?

573
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:44,147
- Gay adults.

574
00:39:47,785 --> 00:39:48,852
- Totally.

575
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,188
Just double checking.

576
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:55,859
I'm just gonna wait for him,

577
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,994
he'll be out in a second.

578
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:36,699
I better head.

579
00:40:37,968 --> 00:40:39,536
It's getting late.

580
00:40:54,585 --> 00:40:58,621
All this time, I thought I was
the only one on the outside.

581
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:02,225
Turns out, I couldn't
have been more wrong.

582
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,689
- Well hello, Conor.

583
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:08,625
Here on the train.

584
00:42:08,627 --> 00:42:11,461
I nearly missed
the bloody train.

585
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,365
So congratulations on today,

586
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,066
what did you play really well?

587
00:42:17,068 --> 00:42:20,103
- Well thanks sir, I
actually missed a few kicks

588
00:42:20,105 --> 00:42:21,337
so not my best.

589
00:42:21,339 --> 00:42:22,705
- Oh did, oh okay.

590
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,207
I was told you got the quarter.

591
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,942
- Semi, semi-finals.

592
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:30,113
- No pressure then.
- - No.

593
00:42:45,963 --> 00:42:49,465
- I might have a cup
of tea or something.

594
00:42:53,637 --> 00:42:56,039
I like a cup of tea, I mean.

595
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,942
Not much of a coffee drinker

596
00:42:58,944 --> 00:43:02,145
but I like a cup
of tea, or a pot,

597
00:43:02,147 --> 00:43:03,713
nice big pot, pot of tea.

598
00:43:03,715 --> 00:43:05,048
Big pot of tea.

599
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,885
- Sir, before, it's not my team.

600
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,386
- No, no, no.

601
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:12,755
I was bursting for a loo and
it was the nearest bar around.

602
00:43:12,757 --> 00:43:14,557
- Yeah, you know my
friend, my there Conor,

603
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,059
he's very affectionate.

604
00:43:16,061 --> 00:43:17,160
- There's no signs out front.

605
00:43:17,162 --> 00:43:18,661
- Yes, very poorly signed.

606
00:43:18,663 --> 00:43:21,064
He's an Italian, you know,
he's all over, you know.

607
00:43:21,066 --> 00:43:22,131
Oh Jesus.

608
00:43:24,335 --> 00:43:28,237
Conor, I think a certain
degree of discretion.

609
00:43:29,373 --> 00:43:31,774
- I'm never gonna
say anything, sir.

610
00:43:31,776 --> 00:43:32,775
- About anything.

611
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:33,776
- Ever.
- Ever.

612
00:43:33,778 --> 00:43:34,844
Okay, good.

613
00:43:38,048 --> 00:43:39,115
Okay.

614
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,618
Right.

615
00:43:48,525 --> 00:43:51,628
I might get a cup of tea,
do you want a cup of tea?

616
00:43:51,630 --> 00:43:53,363
Do you want one?
- Yeah.

617
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:54,931
- Okay.

618
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:55,999
Okay.

619
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,227
- Okay, have
you learned your part?

620
00:44:24,229 --> 00:44:25,294
- I have.

621
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:28,264
- There's no avoiding
this any longer so,

622
00:44:28,266 --> 00:44:30,566
let's just go for it, okay.

623
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,370
One, two, three...

624
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:36,005
- sorry, Conor, before we start.

625
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:37,507
- What?

626
00:44:37,509 --> 00:44:38,641
- Just, um...

627
00:44:51,088 --> 00:44:52,588
Nothing, nothing.

628
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:56,259
- You sure?

629
00:44:56,261 --> 00:44:57,326
- Yeah.

630
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,700
- One, two, three, four.

631
00:45:17,449 --> 00:45:18,815
You made me do it by myself.

632
00:45:18,817 --> 00:45:21,050
- I just...
- Teamwork, Ned.

633
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:24,487
- Yeah.

634
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,456
- You ready?

635
00:45:27,624 --> 00:45:30,126
One, two, three, four.

636
00:45:44,008 --> 00:45:45,208
I thought we agreed
that you would go high

637
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:46,242
and I would go low.

638
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,477
- We did.

639
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:48,711
- I thought you said
you learned your part.

640
00:45:48,713 --> 00:45:51,914
- I did, I have, I mean
I have learned my part

641
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:52,982
it's just,

642
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:57,420
all I can hear in my
head is your voice.

643
00:45:57,422 --> 00:46:00,156
And you know, it makes
me wanna follow you.

644
00:46:00,158 --> 00:46:01,691
- Well don't.

645
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:02,992
Sing your own part or I can
go high and you can go low.

646
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,193
- No, I can be high.

647
00:46:04,195 --> 00:46:06,028
- Okay then, be high.

648
00:46:06,997 --> 00:46:08,664
- Okay.

649
00:46:08,666 --> 00:46:10,733
- One, two, three, four.

650
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,062
Think that was alright.

651
00:46:40,064 --> 00:46:41,130
- Yeah.

652
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,717
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

653
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,223
Conor, sport, kicking,

654
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:11,694
takes a quiet mind,

655
00:47:11,696 --> 00:47:13,963
you need to have nothing
going on in there.

656
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:15,031
Okay?

657
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,634
So what's eating you?

658
00:47:20,504 --> 00:47:21,571
- Sir,

659
00:47:24,374 --> 00:47:27,343
sometimes I just
feel like a robot.

660
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,948
Doing this again and again.

661
00:47:34,418 --> 00:47:37,920
Maybe there's a little
more to life than.

662
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,859
- You have a rare gift.

663
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,162
And you need to use it.

664
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,701
And recently I've noticed
you hanging around

665
00:47:51,703 --> 00:47:54,303
with different
people, that's fine,

666
00:47:54,305 --> 00:47:55,671
I suppose, whatever.

667
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:57,907
But here's the thing son,

668
00:47:57,909 --> 00:48:01,143
you lie down with
dogs, you get fleas.

669
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:08,517
Have you identified the fleas?

670
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,788
Don't complicated this son.

671
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:15,424
There's you and that and those.

672
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:18,527
Now come on.

673
00:48:32,876 --> 00:48:34,210
For fucks sake.

674
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:38,981
- Good morning Pascal.

675
00:48:38,983 --> 00:48:40,049
- Walter.

676
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,251
Question?

677
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:48,124
Have you run a background
check on Dan Sherry?

678
00:48:48,126 --> 00:48:49,859
- And why would I do that?

679
00:48:49,861 --> 00:48:52,428
- Sherry's not married, is he?

680
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:55,564
- What are you asking?

681
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:56,866
- I don't know what I'm asking

682
00:48:56,868 --> 00:48:59,435
only I'm sure you notice
that Conor masters level

683
00:48:59,437 --> 00:49:02,338
is dropping, he misses
a number of kicks

684
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,874
in the match yesterday and
then very late last night,

685
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:09,345
I encounter him sauntering
back to school drunk

686
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:11,547
in the company of a
certain Dan Sherry.

687
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:14,283
I want you to Walter,
I'm concerned.

688
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:16,385
- Did you not take the boys
for a celebratory glass

689
00:49:16,387 --> 00:49:17,653
of beer last night?

690
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:19,922
- Yes but that was just...
- But nothing.

691
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:22,258
If you don't know what
you're asking, Pascal,

692
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,860
be careful what
you're insinuating.

693
00:49:24,862 --> 00:49:27,697
- Walter, I need your support.

694
00:49:27,699 --> 00:49:29,231
Everything hinges on this.

695
00:49:29,233 --> 00:49:31,767
We, the team, we need it.

696
00:49:31,769 --> 00:49:34,170
- Dan Sherry is a
teacher in this school

697
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:36,038
just like you and I.

698
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,440
This is the team.

699
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:38,941
- Sherry is like me?

700
00:49:38,943 --> 00:49:40,843
Nah, I don't think so.

701
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,679
Listen, forget it, it's fine.

702
00:49:43,681 --> 00:49:46,849
I just wanted to put my
concerns on the record in case,

703
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,117
that's all.

704
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,685
- In case of what?

705
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,494
- Boys Conor's age are
highly impressionable.

706
00:49:58,496 --> 00:49:59,762
You know this.

707
00:49:59,764 --> 00:50:02,098
Certain types of people
as teachers around kids,

708
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:03,799
once you know for certain
that those certain types

709
00:50:03,801 --> 00:50:05,968
of people are those
certain types of people,

710
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:07,803
I mean, I would consider
myself a Christian

711
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:08,938
and a liberal but...

712
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,272
- but?

713
00:50:10,274 --> 00:50:11,674
- But those certain
aforementioned types of people,

714
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,476
those certain types of behaviors

715
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:15,644
are seriously not cool.

716
00:50:15,646 --> 00:50:17,947
Not cool near children.

717
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:18,948
You know this.

718
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:20,182
- Thank you Pascal.

719
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:21,350
- I mean, you have
to know that Walter.

720
00:50:21,352 --> 00:50:22,651
- Thank you Pascal.

721
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,286
- Thank you Walter.

722
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:34,497
- Okay, this is a
lesson in projection.

723
00:50:34,499 --> 00:50:35,498
What?

724
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,732
In projection, yes.

725
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:38,067
Yes, move back.

726
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:41,003
Keep going, keep going,
keep going, keep going,

727
00:50:41,005 --> 00:50:42,638
stop, stop, stop, stop.

728
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,173
Okay, when you sing tomorrow,

729
00:50:44,175 --> 00:50:47,276
you can't whimper like some
weird little field mice.

730
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:49,945
Okay, you've got to project.

731
00:50:49,947 --> 00:50:53,716
Reveal to me who
you are if you dare.

732
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,318
Let your voices
bounce off the walls.

733
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,620
Alright, begin.

734
00:51:01,959 --> 00:51:03,192
- I can't hear you.

735
00:51:03,194 --> 00:51:04,760
At all.

736
00:51:04,762 --> 00:51:05,761
What?

737
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:07,396
Louder!

738
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,464
Yes, louder.

739
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:13,169
Louder, louder, come one!

740
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:17,139
- Better.

741
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,277
- I just have to
do more, you know,

742
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:23,512
flexibility, conditioning.

743
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,250
- That's your out-half there.

744
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,693
Any idea why Conor
left his old school?

745
00:51:37,695 --> 00:51:38,928
- No.

746
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,096
- You have a cousin at
st Barts, don't you?

747
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,231
- Well, he's actually
a second cousin.

748
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,934
But actually, I was
meant to go there myself

749
00:51:44,936 --> 00:51:47,303
but when my dad died...

750
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:50,773
- he's letting all our
hard work go to waste.

751
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:51,807
I wouldn't be happen about that

752
00:51:51,809 --> 00:51:54,176
if I was on his team.

753
00:51:54,178 --> 00:51:56,745
Matter of fact, I'd be raging.

754
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:10,860
- Knock, knock.

755
00:52:10,862 --> 00:52:12,128
Ah, there's Conor.

756
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:13,662
Hey, can I ask you something?

757
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:14,730
- Yeah.

758
00:52:15,899 --> 00:52:19,702
- Yeah, why are you hanging
out with that freak Ned?

759
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:22,171
- That freak Ned is my mate.

760
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,739
- Your mate how?

761
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,107
- He's my roommate weasel.

762
00:52:25,109 --> 00:52:26,842
- Oh, okay, got you.

763
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:29,411
- Everything okay up there?

764
00:52:29,413 --> 00:52:30,412
- Everything's
really good, Conor.

765
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:33,149
Just, I have cousin in st Barts.

766
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:36,986
Well, second cousin.

767
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:40,289
But I know everyone says
you left your old school

768
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:43,826
because I don't know, you
were fighting all the time

769
00:52:43,828 --> 00:52:47,329
but I was talking to
him and I was wondering,

770
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:49,899
what was the reason, you know,

771
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:52,668
for all this fighting.

772
00:52:53,637 --> 00:52:55,971
Why the fighting, you know?

773
00:52:57,474 --> 00:52:59,708
- What do you want, weasel?

774
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,911
- Conor, I promised my father,

775
00:53:01,913 --> 00:53:04,580
on his death bed, that
I would do everything

776
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:07,683
in my power to win that cup.

777
00:53:07,685 --> 00:53:09,818
I'm not the only
one that's noticing

778
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,588
you're spending a lot of time

779
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:15,157
with the wrong kind of people.

780
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:18,360
What we're gonna do is,

781
00:53:18,362 --> 00:53:20,462
you're gonna pick your
company a little bit better.

782
00:53:20,464 --> 00:53:22,598
You're gonna focus
on the semi-final.

783
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,202
And we'll let the rumors
from your old school

784
00:53:26,204 --> 00:53:28,837
be rumors from your old school.

785
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,275
Yeah, good.

786
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,144
Good chat.

787
00:53:36,213 --> 00:53:37,279
Good chat.

788
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,801
- When I woke up on
the day of the talent show,

789
00:53:58,803 --> 00:54:00,970
and there was no sign of Conor.

790
00:54:00,972 --> 00:54:03,739
I wasn't that surprised.

791
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,441
If you play for the rugby team,

792
00:54:05,443 --> 00:54:07,943
you're up early for training.

793
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,047
- You look up,
eyes up everybody.

794
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,752
- You get to skip
all sorts of classes.

795
00:54:16,754 --> 00:54:19,154
Especially when it
gets to the semi-final.

796
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:20,956
You're carrying the
hopes of the school

797
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:22,224
on your shoulders.

798
00:54:22,226 --> 00:54:25,861
Is an education more
important than that?

799
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:35,437
But I was worried by six P.M.

800
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:44,380
- He's not coming, okay.

801
00:54:44,382 --> 00:54:45,581
- Sir, I can't do it alone.

802
00:54:45,583 --> 00:54:47,182
- You can, you can do it.

803
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:48,884
- So give it up for Clinton.

804
00:55:08,838 --> 00:55:09,872
- He's a genius.

805
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:12,441
- He's not, he's not a genius.

806
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:35,564
How is he doing that?

807
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:50,946
All you need to
do is go out there

808
00:55:50,948 --> 00:55:53,115
and let them hear your voice.

809
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:56,151
That's all, that's all
you need to do, okay?

810
00:55:56,153 --> 00:55:59,888
- From two current
Woodhill college students.

811
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:03,759
- Hey good luck, don't
be nervous, you're fine.

812
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,303
- One of us, actually.

813
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:18,006
Turns out there's
only one of us.

814
00:56:34,491 --> 00:56:35,958
- Oh Jesus.

815
00:57:25,241 --> 00:57:27,543
- Hey there Pascal.

816
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,111
Can I have a word?

817
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:31,013
- It's a free country.

818
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,750
- So you must be pretty
excited, quarter finals.

819
00:57:34,752 --> 00:57:37,453
- Semi-finals.
- Semi-finals.

820
00:57:37,455 --> 00:57:40,022
That's exciting, yeah.

821
00:57:40,024 --> 00:57:41,757
- It's no time for complacency.

822
00:57:41,759 --> 00:57:43,492
- No, no, no, quite.

823
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:48,497
So listen, Conor, he
didn't show up to sing

824
00:57:48,499 --> 00:57:50,299
at the variety show.

825
00:57:50,301 --> 00:57:52,801
- He had kicking practice.

826
00:57:52,803 --> 00:57:54,336
- Oh, you knew about it.

827
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:58,140
- Well in semi-final week our
out-half had more important

828
00:57:58,142 --> 00:57:59,675
things on his mind.

829
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:03,846
- Sure it wasn't you who had
other things on his mind?

830
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,186
- I consider you something of

831
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:13,155
a Trojan horse, Sherry.

832
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:16,658
- Not sure where
this is going, pas.

833
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,961
- Encouraging Conor
masters to be a singer

834
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,096
one week before the
semi-final of the senior cup?

835
00:58:21,098 --> 00:58:23,999
- Come on, I'm
trying to help him.

836
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,270
- You can have the weird
ones with the dyed hair

837
00:58:28,272 --> 00:58:30,305
and the banjos.

838
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:32,541
I've got fuck all use of them.

839
00:58:32,543 --> 00:58:33,609
No interest.

840
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:38,480
I say this to you the once,

841
00:58:38,482 --> 00:58:42,518
you'd do well to let the
boy focus on his rugby.

842
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:43,585
You get me?

843
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:49,958
- Got apple in your beard.

844
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,140
- Meanwhile, the school rugby,

845
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,742
for out-half Conor masters.

846
00:59:06,744 --> 00:59:08,510
Inspiration with
the ball at hand,

847
00:59:08,512 --> 00:59:10,145
troubled off the kicking team.

848
00:59:10,147 --> 00:59:13,181
Despite two penalty misses,
Woodhill college progresses

849
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:15,684
to their first senior
final in over a decade.

850
00:59:15,686 --> 00:59:17,920
- Everyone
who's ever been young,

851
00:59:17,922 --> 00:59:19,988
so that's everyone ever,

852
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:22,658
knows just what
humiliation feels like.

853
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,226
But worse than the embarrassment

854
00:59:24,228 --> 00:59:26,295
was Conor's vanishing act.

855
00:59:26,297 --> 00:59:28,530
He had disappeared from my life.

856
00:59:28,532 --> 00:59:30,699
And I can't believe
I'm about to say this

857
00:59:30,701 --> 00:59:32,734
but I missed him.

858
00:59:32,736 --> 00:59:34,136
We were friends.

859
00:59:36,439 --> 00:59:40,175
I wasn't gonna give
that up without a fight.

860
00:59:43,379 --> 00:59:45,847
- Halt, who goes there?

861
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,482
Oh, can I help you?

862
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,919
- I was looking for Conor.

863
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,854
So I can say well
done, is he in there?

864
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:57,059
- Oh um, nope, he's
actually not in there.

865
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,027
I'm really sorry.

866
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:00,429
- Maybe I'll just check.

867
01:00:00,431 --> 01:00:02,898
- Yeah well maybe
instead of checking,

868
01:00:02,900 --> 01:00:06,902
you just piss off, does
that sound like a plan?

869
01:00:06,904 --> 01:00:10,872
I'm not gonna tell you
again to piss off, okay?

870
01:00:16,145 --> 01:00:17,212
- Fuck.

871
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,757
- Uh uh uh, no.

872
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:30,726
- Hey Ned, Ned, leave it.

873
01:00:30,728 --> 01:00:32,728
Come on man, just
leave him be, will you?

874
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,997
- Thank you, I wanna go
see my friend, Conor.

875
01:00:34,999 --> 01:00:38,333
- He is not your friend,
he's your roommate.

876
01:00:38,335 --> 01:00:41,003
He had no choice but
to hang out with you.

877
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:42,237
Do you get it?

878
01:00:44,674 --> 01:00:48,410
Conor, this little, I
don't know vol appears

879
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,415
to be very much
in love with you.

880
01:00:53,417 --> 01:00:56,518
Now, I told him, you're
that way inclined

881
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,253
but maybe I'm wrong.

882
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,529
Am I wrong, Conor?

883
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,972
- Go back to the
fucking dorm man.

884
01:01:16,974 --> 01:01:19,975
- Yeah, go back to
the dorm faggot.

885
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,879
- Tell them, Conor.

886
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,784
- Go back to the
fucking dorm, man.

887
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:30,252
- Tell them.

888
01:01:30,254 --> 01:01:32,087
I only meant for Conor
to tell his teammates

889
01:01:32,089 --> 01:01:35,223
that we were friends,
but looking back,

890
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:37,359
maybe he thought I
knew more than that.

891
01:01:37,361 --> 01:01:38,427
Tell them.

892
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,196
- I'm warning you.

893
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:57,012
- Conor, this is some
shit right here.

894
01:01:57,014 --> 01:01:58,580
- Fuck off weasel.

895
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:04,386
- See you later then.

896
01:02:45,228 --> 01:02:47,863
- Those masterful
images because complete

897
01:02:47,865 --> 01:02:51,967
grew in pure mind,
but out of what began?

898
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:55,737
A mound of refuse or the
sweepings of a street,

899
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:59,341
old kettles, old bottles,
and a broken can,

900
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:03,278
old iron, old bones, old
rags, that raving slut

901
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,847
who keeps the till.

902
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,785
Now that my ladder's gone,

903
01:03:09,787 --> 01:03:13,922
I must lie down where
all the ladders start

904
01:03:13,924 --> 01:03:15,824
in the foul rag and bone shop.

905
01:03:19,695 --> 01:03:20,762
Come in.

906
01:03:33,176 --> 01:03:34,209
Go on then.

907
01:03:34,211 --> 01:03:35,811
- Everyone up.

908
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:36,878
Follow us.

909
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,248
- Complusionary cheerleading
at the head of the final.

910
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:44,486
Pretty much the last place
on earth I wanted to be.

911
01:04:06,376 --> 01:04:08,610
- Lyrically these
songs left a little

912
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:11,179
to be desired but on this day,

913
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:14,416
lyrics weren't the problem.

914
01:04:14,418 --> 01:04:16,685
It was what was behind them.

915
01:04:16,687 --> 01:04:18,420
This wasn't my team.

916
01:04:24,293 --> 01:04:26,361
Maybe the idea of
getting expelled

917
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:28,096
began to surface once again.

918
01:04:28,098 --> 01:04:30,398
Honestly, I don't remember.

919
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:39,941
- Sing.

920
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,043
Fucking sing.

921
01:04:44,413 --> 01:04:45,480
Sing.

922
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,417
Sing you little queer.

923
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:50,552
- They wanted me to sing?

924
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:52,520
I'd sing like a canary.

925
01:04:53,656 --> 01:04:55,857
I had this big piece of
news that I could share

926
01:04:55,859 --> 01:04:57,158
and what was I keeping it for?

927
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:59,027
There was nothing wrong
with being different,

928
01:04:59,029 --> 01:05:01,062
I knew that and why did
Conor get to be adored

929
01:05:01,064 --> 01:05:03,098
and me bullied when
we were both the same?

930
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:04,799
Oh I'd tell them,
I'd tell everyone.

931
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:07,769
Then they'd apologize
and everyone would be

932
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:09,037
on my side for once.

933
01:05:09,039 --> 01:05:11,172
Finally, Neddie had the conch.

934
01:05:11,174 --> 01:05:13,241
I'll tell you who's gay.

935
01:05:14,343 --> 01:05:17,212
Oh I'll tell you
who's gay alright.

936
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:20,348
Conor masters is gay.

937
01:05:27,657 --> 01:05:29,324
There it is, folks.

938
01:05:30,860 --> 01:05:32,661
That terrible memory.

939
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,805
- Your parents are flying
home from Dubai tonight.

940
01:06:16,807 --> 01:06:19,007
They'll be here first
thing in the morning.

941
01:06:19,009 --> 01:06:20,342
Ned, I'm aware you
haven't had it easy

942
01:06:20,344 --> 01:06:23,244
in this school but
grabbing a megaphone,

943
01:06:23,246 --> 01:06:25,714
disrupting match preparations,

944
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:27,282
it crosses a line.

945
01:06:28,517 --> 01:06:30,151
- Am I expelled?

946
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:32,654
- You'll sleep in the
infirmary tonight.

947
01:06:32,656 --> 01:06:36,157
We'll meet tomorrow
morning at eight A.M.

948
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:41,429
I expected so much
more from you Ned.

949
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:43,331
I expected compassion.

950
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:47,469
Towards a boy who was new,

951
01:06:47,471 --> 01:06:49,371
towards a boy who was
always going to feel

952
01:06:49,373 --> 01:06:52,774
a little different
from the rest of you.

953
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:01,716
You of all people I thought
could empathize with that.

954
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:05,820
Go on, leave.

955
01:07:13,963 --> 01:07:16,031
- It's funny
how it goes, isn't it?

956
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:17,832
Now that I'd seemed to
have achieved my goal

957
01:07:17,834 --> 01:07:19,801
of getting expelled,
there was nothing

958
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:21,536
I wanted more than
to go back to being

959
01:07:21,538 --> 01:07:23,905
a pupil in this school.

960
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:31,946
- Hey Conor.

961
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,948
- Can I talk to you?

962
01:07:33,950 --> 01:07:36,351
- Yeah, yeah course you can.

963
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:41,056
Although I can't let
you in here, sorry.

964
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:42,724
Stupid regulations.

965
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,728
Come on, we'll go for a walk.

966
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,573
So, big day tomorrow Conor.

967
01:07:59,942 --> 01:08:01,910
It's the first final
in, how long is it?

968
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:04,245
- Yeah, I can't do.

969
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,581
- It's just nerves,
you're a great player

970
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,516
with a great team, you're fine.

971
01:08:08,518 --> 01:08:11,853
- It's got nothing
to do with it.

972
01:08:11,855 --> 01:08:13,888
Sir, I saw you with your friend.

973
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,457
You were together.

974
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:27,102
- So you saw me with a
friend, Conor, so what?

975
01:08:29,405 --> 01:08:31,406
Look, I know it's hard.

976
01:08:34,844 --> 01:08:36,478
I know.

977
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:38,980
But it gets better, trust me.

978
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:42,550
- When I'm older.

979
01:08:42,552 --> 01:08:43,952
- Yeah, when you're older.

980
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:46,154
Sad fact of life.

981
01:08:46,156 --> 01:08:47,922
- So, I'm just
supposed to keep lying?

982
01:08:47,924 --> 01:08:49,991
- It's not a lie.

983
01:08:49,993 --> 01:08:51,092
It's not necessarily lying

984
01:08:51,094 --> 01:08:53,361
if you keep something
to yourself.

985
01:08:53,363 --> 01:08:54,963
- But if you pretend to
be something you're not

986
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:56,731
then that's a lie.

987
01:08:56,733 --> 01:08:58,933
Sir, I remember the
lesson with Ned,

988
01:08:58,935 --> 01:09:00,135
I remember when
you called him out

989
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:02,036
for plagiarizing that song.

990
01:09:02,038 --> 01:09:03,338
Don't use a borrowed
voice, you said,

991
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,507
find your own voice,
don't be a sheep.

992
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,542
Sir, you said that lesson
wasn't just for Ned,

993
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:08,776
you said it was for all of us

994
01:09:08,778 --> 01:09:11,312
so why am I exempt,
why am I different

995
01:09:11,314 --> 01:09:12,514
from everyone else?

996
01:09:12,516 --> 01:09:14,682
- Can't be all things
to all men, Conor,

997
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,285
at all times, its not smart.

998
01:09:17,287 --> 01:09:18,553
- Why not?

999
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:19,988
- Sometimes you need to
keep things hidden away

1000
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:21,723
to protect yourself.

1001
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:31,399
There will come a
point in the future

1002
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:33,535
when you won't have
to lie anymore.

1003
01:09:33,537 --> 01:09:34,602
Trust me.

1004
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:37,038
- Will there?

1005
01:09:37,806 --> 01:09:38,873
- Yeah.

1006
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:42,644
- And did you hit that point?

1007
01:09:42,646 --> 01:09:44,546
- This isn't about me.

1008
01:09:50,085 --> 01:09:51,419
It gets better.

1009
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:55,557
It gets better.

1010
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:00,228
That's all I can say to you.

1011
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:02,363
Please believe me, Conor.

1012
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:07,202
- How on earth can I even
begin to believe you?

1013
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:11,172
- Oh Conor,

1014
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:13,474
Conor.

1015
01:10:28,123 --> 01:10:30,925
- Jesus Christ,
Conor it's 11:05.

1016
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:39,400
- We take this type of
transgression very seriously.

1017
01:10:39,402 --> 01:10:41,936
We'll take the
midterm to consider.

1018
01:10:41,938 --> 01:10:43,838
But punishment will be severe.

1019
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:46,674
- I appreciate all
of that, thank you.

1020
01:10:46,676 --> 01:10:50,345
Tell me though, what
happened to my son's face?

1021
01:10:50,347 --> 01:10:53,815
- Well we can't get an
answer on that, I'm afraid.

1022
01:10:53,817 --> 01:10:54,882
Ned?

1023
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,252
- Nothing happened.

1024
01:10:57,254 --> 01:10:59,087
- Something happened.

1025
01:11:00,256 --> 01:11:02,991
- This is nobody's
fault but my own.

1026
01:11:02,993 --> 01:11:04,459
- More than anything,
this is about preserving

1027
01:11:04,461 --> 01:11:06,928
the ethos of the school.

1028
01:11:06,930 --> 01:11:08,062
- Sir, sorry.

1029
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:11,266
- Wait outside, Victor.

1030
01:11:13,969 --> 01:11:15,203
- I can't sir.

1031
01:11:16,138 --> 01:11:17,939
Conor's gone missing.

1032
01:11:19,842 --> 01:11:23,678
He didn't stay in
his bed last night.

1033
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:24,979
He's gone.

1034
01:11:24,981 --> 01:11:28,549
- Well have you told Pascal?
I mean, Mr. O'keefe.

1035
01:11:28,551 --> 01:11:30,752
- No, I thought I'd
come to you first.

1036
01:11:30,754 --> 01:11:33,354
- Well tell Mr. O'keefe I wanna
see him here immediately.

1037
01:11:33,356 --> 01:11:34,922
Go on.

1038
01:11:34,924 --> 01:11:35,990
- Yes sir.

1039
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,806
- Sir, Mr. curly
wants to see you.

1040
01:11:52,941 --> 01:11:54,042
- Victor, I thought
you were supposed

1041
01:11:54,044 --> 01:11:55,643
to be Victor and Conor.

1042
01:11:55,645 --> 01:11:57,545
Where's Conor?

1043
01:11:57,547 --> 01:12:00,381
- Sir, there was an
incident yesterday.

1044
01:12:00,383 --> 01:12:02,216
Conor, he's gone missing.

1045
01:12:02,218 --> 01:12:04,052
- What do you mean
missing, Victor?

1046
01:12:04,054 --> 01:12:06,487
- Walter wants to
see you, sir, now.

1047
01:12:06,489 --> 01:12:08,656
- Walter wants to see me?

1048
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,294
Of course this has
to happen today.

1049
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:14,762
Thank you Victor.

1050
01:12:23,706 --> 01:12:26,474
- Hey Pascal, good luck today.

1051
01:12:26,476 --> 01:12:27,542
You okay?

1052
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,313
- Is your delight Sherry?

1053
01:12:32,315 --> 01:12:35,083
Over the fucking moon, yeah?

1054
01:12:35,085 --> 01:12:36,117
- What?

1055
01:12:36,119 --> 01:12:37,652
- Conor masters, huh?

1056
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:40,421
Missing on the day of the final.

1057
01:12:40,423 --> 01:12:42,557
- Missing?
- Missing, yes.

1058
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:46,127
What part of missing
don't you understand?

1059
01:13:29,037 --> 01:13:32,774
- When we get back, can I
please jump out in town?

1060
01:13:32,776 --> 01:13:35,076
I really need to do something?

1061
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:36,978
- You must be kidding.

1062
01:13:42,918 --> 01:13:45,319
- Look dad, I know
I'm in trouble

1063
01:13:45,321 --> 01:13:48,990
but I wouldn't ask if it
wasn't absolutely vital.

1064
01:13:48,992 --> 01:13:51,826
- Not only are you
not jumping out, Ned,

1065
01:13:51,828 --> 01:13:54,695
you are massively,
unbelievably grounded

1066
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:58,433
until we can figure out
what to do with you.

1067
01:14:09,878 --> 01:14:10,945
- Dan.

1068
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:18,519
I suppose you heard
about Conor masters.

1069
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:19,587
- Yeah.

1070
01:14:20,656 --> 01:14:23,324
- His parents don't
know where he is.

1071
01:14:23,326 --> 01:14:26,894
Well, I've notified
the coach anyways, so.

1072
01:14:28,864 --> 01:14:32,500
And we have an untested
player in out-half.

1073
01:14:33,669 --> 01:14:35,236
I mean, Wallace is a pest.

1074
01:14:35,238 --> 01:14:39,140
- Oh who cares about the
fucking rugby Walter?

1075
01:14:40,008 --> 01:14:42,310
Some boys don't play rugby.

1076
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,613
What about those boys?

1077
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,217
- Ned, Ned!

1078
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,086
Fuck.

1079
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:37,765
- Conor was always running.

1080
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:39,600
I couldn't understand it.

1081
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:42,136
But now I finally got it.

1082
01:15:42,138 --> 01:15:46,374
You have to know that you're
running in the right direction.

1083
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:14,235
- Men.

1084
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:21,309
You might be wondering
where our out-half is.

1085
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:26,781
Earlier, as you know, I was
called to Mr. curly's office

1086
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:31,018
and informed that the boy
had some kind of breakdown

1087
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,689
and has gone missing.

1088
01:16:34,691 --> 01:16:36,924
Today of all days, I know.

1089
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:42,697
I don't know if you're aware
of the rumors swirling around.

1090
01:16:42,699 --> 01:16:46,701
But it transpires that
he was dealing with,

1091
01:16:46,703 --> 01:16:48,669
serious personal issues.

1092
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:52,907
But he's missing today,
and I wanna tell you this,

1093
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:57,078
we are way better
off without him.

1094
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:01,349
I mean, we all have
personal issues

1095
01:17:01,351 --> 01:17:05,152
but look around you,
anyone who can't be trusted

1096
01:17:05,154 --> 01:17:09,390
to put those issues to one
side can't be part of a team.

1097
01:17:14,363 --> 01:17:19,066
We all have shit that we're
going through you know.

1098
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,134
Do you run?

1099
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:24,105
No.

1100
01:17:26,708 --> 01:17:27,775
You stay.

1101
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:32,513
You stay and you
deal with your shit

1102
01:17:32,515 --> 01:17:35,716
by standing in a field,
blowing a whistle

1103
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:37,451
in the fucking rain.

1104
01:17:44,726 --> 01:17:46,193
- Let's go warriors, let's go.

1105
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:49,130
Let's go warriors, let's go.

1106
01:19:02,971 --> 01:19:04,038
- Hello?

1107
01:19:14,216 --> 01:19:15,449
Can I come in?

1108
01:19:16,351 --> 01:19:18,018
- What do you want?

1109
01:19:20,322 --> 01:19:24,558
- I want to apologize for
being a terrible friend.

1110
01:19:26,495 --> 01:19:29,296
- So you knew
about me all along?

1111
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:31,999
- I'm so sorry Conor.

1112
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:39,573
I want you to play.

1113
01:19:39,575 --> 01:19:41,008
There's still time.

1114
01:19:41,010 --> 01:19:42,943
- You said that that
wasn't your team.

1115
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:45,880
You've never even
seen us play before.

1116
01:19:45,882 --> 01:19:48,382
- Look, I was wrong.

1117
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:52,620
Okay, turns out I was wrong
about pretty much everything.

1118
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,023
- Not everything.

1119
01:20:00,695 --> 01:20:03,697
- You don't have to
pick a side, Conor.

1120
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:05,232
You don't have to be
one thing or the other.

1121
01:20:05,234 --> 01:20:07,134
You can be everything.

1122
01:20:08,336 --> 01:20:10,371
- I'm not sure I
can play for them.

1123
01:20:10,373 --> 01:20:12,606
For weasel, for the coach.

1124
01:20:13,508 --> 01:20:14,909
- It's for them.

1125
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,478
You're not playing for them.

1126
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,446
You're playing for us.

1127
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:23,317
It's my team if
you're playing on it.

1128
01:20:23,319 --> 01:20:25,619
Reveal to them who you are.

1129
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:27,688
If you dare.

1130
01:20:31,159 --> 01:20:32,393
- If you dare.

1131
01:20:39,134 --> 01:20:40,434
Our team, yeah?

1132
01:22:05,453 --> 01:22:06,520
- Conor.

1133
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:11,592
What can we do for you?

1134
01:22:11,594 --> 01:22:14,828
- Late again, sorry
about that lads.

1135
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,264
- You're mind is shot, right?

1136
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:21,101
You're all over the
place, I understand that.

1137
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,004
- I wasn't shot.

1138
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,708
- Well at this point, Conor,

1139
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:30,210
we all heard about the thing.

1140
01:22:31,146 --> 01:22:32,212
- The thing?

1141
01:22:33,248 --> 01:22:34,682
- The thing.

1142
01:22:34,684 --> 01:22:35,916
- The thing?

1143
01:22:35,918 --> 01:22:38,152
- The thing, the
thing, the thing.

1144
01:22:38,154 --> 01:22:40,321
Look, it's not your fault

1145
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:43,824
but you cannot fit
into this team.

1146
01:22:43,826 --> 01:22:44,992
- Since when?

1147
01:22:44,994 --> 01:22:46,827
- Since, look,
you're incompatible.

1148
01:22:46,829 --> 01:22:48,329
- Incompatible according to who?

1149
01:22:48,331 --> 01:22:49,396
- Us.

1150
01:22:51,166 --> 01:22:54,835
According to all of
us, is that right lads?

1151
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:02,609
- I don't know if you heard
why I left my old school.

1152
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:06,013
- Yeah, we heard you
got in some fights.

1153
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:12,720
- I don't know if you
heard why I was fighting.

1154
01:23:14,689 --> 01:23:18,392
I was fighting everyone
who found out who I was.

1155
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:20,227
Every last one of them.

1156
01:23:20,229 --> 01:23:21,962
But they kept coming

1157
01:23:23,698 --> 01:23:25,933
and I couldn't stop them coming

1158
01:23:25,935 --> 01:23:28,502
and I couldn't fight them all.

1159
01:23:30,505 --> 01:23:33,841
I couldn't stay and keep
denying it so I ran away.

1160
01:23:33,843 --> 01:23:35,075
To our school.

1161
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:38,312
Thing is lads,

1162
01:23:40,782 --> 01:23:43,250
I'd like to stop
running away, you know.

1163
01:23:43,252 --> 01:23:44,885
I'm done with that.

1164
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:50,357
Thanks to Ned here,
you all know who I am.

1165
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,859
I'm the same me
that I always was

1166
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:55,996
and I really really wanna
be a part of this team.

1167
01:23:57,999 --> 01:24:00,034
I'm here and I'm ready to play

1168
01:24:00,036 --> 01:24:02,603
so if you want me on your side.

1169
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,712
- Wallace has been filling in

1170
01:24:11,714 --> 01:24:14,048
and doing a perfectly good job.

1171
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,182
- Come on Pascal.

1172
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:16,316
- No I haven't, Pascal.

1173
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:18,485
- Believe in yourself, boy.

1174
01:24:18,487 --> 01:24:22,356
- I believe I'm fucking
shit at out-half.

1175
01:24:22,358 --> 01:24:24,491
I'm weak and you know it.

1176
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:31,865
- Come on Pascal, just
put Wallace on the wing.

1177
01:24:31,867 --> 01:24:33,367
- Well that's a pity Victor

1178
01:24:33,369 --> 01:24:36,236
because Wallace has just
put himself on the bench.

1179
01:24:36,238 --> 01:24:38,639
There is one coach on this team.

1180
01:24:38,641 --> 01:24:40,207
One voice, not 15.

1181
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,209
You hear me?

1182
01:24:45,313 --> 01:24:47,214
Do you hear me Victor?

1183
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:59,860
Congratulations Victor,
you're off the team now.

1184
01:25:13,875 --> 01:25:15,275
You're a pair of fucking tools.

1185
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:16,977
Lads, I'm sorry but
this lad has ruined

1186
01:25:16,979 --> 01:25:19,379
your hard work for the year.

1187
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:26,854
Anyone else walks
off to that side

1188
01:25:26,856 --> 01:25:28,655
and they're gone too.

1189
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:37,464
I'll forfeit the
game if I have to.

1190
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:39,700
I can do that.

1191
01:25:41,936 --> 01:25:43,804
That's enough, I said.

1192
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:44,872
You hear me?

1193
01:26:00,722 --> 01:26:02,322
Ah for fuck's sake.

1194
01:26:27,515 --> 01:26:30,918
- We all have that one
thing we're ashamed of.

1195
01:26:30,920 --> 01:26:33,554
The memory of one
moment so embarrassing,

1196
01:26:33,556 --> 01:26:37,724
we don't know if we'll
ever be able to forget it.

1197
01:26:37,726 --> 01:26:39,693
A single moment when not only do

1198
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:41,795
we betray everyone around us

1199
01:26:41,797 --> 01:26:44,031
but we betrayed ourselves too

1200
01:26:44,033 --> 01:26:46,166
in the most terrible way.

1201
01:26:49,604 --> 01:26:52,139
Yes we all have that moment.

1202
01:26:52,141 --> 01:26:54,107
But the pain of remembering
the embarrassment begins

1203
01:26:54,109 --> 01:26:58,345
to fade eventually with
the help of a good friend.

1204
01:27:01,783 --> 01:27:03,450
I will never forget that game

1205
01:27:03,452 --> 01:27:05,452
for as long as I live.

1206
01:27:05,454 --> 01:27:08,722
Conor was everywhere,
everyone noticed him,

1207
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:11,091
the determination
to shut people up,

1208
01:27:11,093 --> 01:27:12,726
to prove them wrong.

1209
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,194
What he was feeling
spread throughout

1210
01:27:14,196 --> 01:27:15,963
the team like a fever.

1211
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:19,099
People talked about
it for months after.

1212
01:28:03,845 --> 01:28:04,911
- Conor's playing?

1213
01:28:04,913 --> 01:28:06,680
- Yeah, your Ned found him.

1214
01:28:10,251 --> 01:28:12,653
- Well he's a good kid, Ned.

1215
01:28:18,993 --> 01:28:20,994
Walter, this is Arthur.

1216
01:28:22,096 --> 01:28:24,097
- Hello Arthur, Walter.

1217
01:28:26,367 --> 01:28:28,101
- Arthur's me fella.

1218
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:33,307
We're a bit of an item.

1219
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:57,264
- Like I said, I don't
think I'll ever be able

1220
01:28:57,266 --> 01:29:01,301
to get over the embarrassment
and the shame of what I did.

1221
01:29:01,303 --> 01:29:04,871
But in a way, some good
did come out of it.

1222
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:11,144
That year, everyone in school
learned the same lesson.

1223
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:13,347
Not to speak in
a borrowed voice.

1224
01:30:38,766 --> 01:30:41,768
- You know, one
single year before,

1225
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:44,204
I'd have given
everything I owned

1226
01:30:44,206 --> 01:30:46,540
for that kick to be missed.

1227
01:30:48,943 --> 01:30:50,510
But people change.
