<i>And a hero needed a sidekick.</i>

18

<i>So that boy became a kid,</i>

He'll be here soon.

Detective Jones.

Would I lie to one

Absolutely.

He's... busy with something.

84
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,934
Look, I know Henry has his
personal forcefield and all,

85
00:06:41,034 --> 00:06:43,571
but I am literally
the best person in the world

at sleep fighting
while speaking Spanish.

87
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,709
Which, by the way, means
that if our friend shows up

88
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,944
and Henry is not here,

89
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,345
I'll take care of it.

00:06:52,446 --> 00:06:54,381
[woman] "Our friend"?

91
00:06:54,515 --> 00:06:57,851
Since when does Jasper Dunlop

92
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,787
Piper? What are you doing
in Dystopia?

93
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:01,455
Schwoz? What--no--I--

94
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,290
- [laughing] Jasper!
- Schwoz?

95
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,959
[Piper] What do you have on,
some kind of duster situation?

96
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:08,729
- It's not a duster. A coat.
- You look like a space cowboy.

97
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:10,263
I'm not a cowboy.
I'm a superhero.

98
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:12,565
- Nice to see you.
- It's good to see you.

99
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:14,701
Welcome to Dystopia,
but please leave.

100
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:17,437
B-b-but we came
all the way from Swellview.

101
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,072
Yeah. I'm on spring break.

102
00:07:19,206 --> 00:07:21,609
Decided to surprise my brother
and his best friend.

103
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:24,544
And then I remembered that
Charlotte's actually at Harvard,

104
00:07:24,545 --> 00:07:27,046
so, like Henry,
we're stuck with you.

105
00:07:27,047 --> 00:07:28,281
All right.

106
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:31,084
[laughs] Oh, my God!
I'm kidding.

107
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,053
- What's your deal?
- Yeah. You were Mr. Cool

108
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,823
with the cute cop over there.

109
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,791
That's 'cause I was flirting
with her.

110
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,060
Oh... that was not flirting.

111
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,063
- Lemme help you out.
- What?

112
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,132
- Hey, yo, Detective Good Hair.
- Okay. All right.

113
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:47,267
- My guy is into you.
- [Jason] That's enough.

114
00:07:47,367 --> 00:07:48,368
What do you say?

115
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,137
- Thumbs up or thumbs down?
- Or down?

116
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,672
[Jasper] I'm sorry.
Lost tourists.

117
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,807
You are little bit
out of his league.

118
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,009
- No, I'm in a league--of sorts.
- A little.

119
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:57,310
All right, guys, guys, guys.

120
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,479
Now is just not a good time, okay?

121
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,447
What, are you and Henry
on a mission?

122
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:03,917
Yeah. I heard you are
the hottest crime fighters

123
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:06,654
- in Dystopia right now.
- I heard Henry's your boss.

124
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,621
He's not my boss.
We're partners.

125
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,558
In fact, he's signing
an endorsement deal

126
00:08:10,658 --> 00:08:13,326
- for us right now.
- Then why aren't you there?

127
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:15,328
- Yeah. Why aren't you there?
- Trust me, guys.

128
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,164
They didn't only
want to see Henry.

129
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:22,435
[crowd chanting, cheering]
Henry, Henry, Henry, Henry!

130
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,839
- So I'm kinda busy right now.
- Come on!

131
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,375
Don't work, don't work.
Not tonight!

132
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:31,244
Yeah, let's go get Henry
and go see a show.

133
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,946
Yes. That is a great idea.

134
00:08:33,046 --> 00:08:36,049
Okay, I realize you two are kind
of in Tourist Mode right now.

135
00:08:36,216 --> 00:08:38,485
- What do you mean?
- What's that supposed to mean?

136
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:40,319
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

137
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,890
But a truck full of
plutonium-239's about to roll

138
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,357
down that street in five minutes

139
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,727
and something's going
to attack it.

140
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:48,929
- You mean someone.
- I mean something.

141
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,430
People here call it Blackout.

142
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,734
So this Blackout has beef
with you and Henry?

143
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,369
- It's got beef with plutonium.
- What?

144
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,271
Dystopia runs on nuclear power,

145
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,507
so it buys fuel rods
from other countries,

146
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:02,943
and that delivery truck's
gonna go right past us.

147
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:06,479
Blackout's plan?
Destroy the plutonium fuel rods.

148
00:09:07,347 --> 00:09:10,050
Why does it want to destroy
the fuel rods?

149
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:12,085
No fuel, no power.

150
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:14,821
No power, no lights. Only...

151
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:16,289
Blackout!

152
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:18,391
Henry, how's it feel
to be the new spokesman

153
00:09:18,525 --> 00:09:20,193
- for BizWatch?
- Henry, what's it like being

154
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,896
the hottest crime fighter
in Dystopia?

155
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,733
- [commotion]
- [man] Where'd the lights go?

156
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:29,236
- [woman] I'm scared of the dark.
- [man] Hold me, Henry!

Now... if you'll excuse me.

- Is there a camera somewhere?

- Are we in a commercial now?

Did you get a BizWatch for me?

00:20:26,626 --> 00:20:27,727
into our house.

317
00:20:27,827 --> 00:20:29,462
You don't even know
what I'm capable of.

318
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,098
I know you're not capable
of keeping me quiet.

319
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,267
You know what?
Just don't tell Mom.

320
00:20:34,401 --> 00:20:37,770
She's got like three jobs
and doesn't need this stress.

321
00:20:37,904 --> 00:20:40,340
Fine. I was never here.

322
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,242
[dramatic music plays]

323
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:47,847
[door slams]

324
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:50,750
Oh! [laughs]

325
00:20:52,619 --> 00:20:54,086
Uh, first of all, hello.

326
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,955
The handshake.
Let's keep it formal.

327
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:57,590
Missy Martin,
Kid Danger superfan.

328
00:20:57,724 --> 00:20:59,726
And I've run so many
Kid Danger fan fictions.

329
00:20:59,826 --> 00:21:02,028
- You're gonna love--
- How did I get here?

330
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,729
Oh! [giggles]

331
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,632
With this baby.

332
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,134
The Reality Altering Device.

333
00:21:08,301 --> 00:21:10,902
Okay, what, uh, ha...

334
00:21:10,903 --> 00:21:12,204
what does it do?

335
00:21:12,305 --> 00:21:14,239
It uses color confinement
to pry open the space

336
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,275
between baryons, mesons--
who cares how it works?

337
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,478
I just brought Kid Danger back
from the dead!

338
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:20,747
What's the afterlife like?
Actually, don't tell me.

339
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:21,948
I wanna be surprised.

340
00:21:22,749 --> 00:21:23,850
Oh, I wasn't dead.

341
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,186
[laughs] Uh, I-I'm sorry. What?

342
00:21:29,489 --> 00:21:31,057
I said I wasn't dead.

343
00:21:31,157 --> 00:21:33,925
Yes, you were. You died
in a fiery blimp accident

344
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:35,595
after you saved
all of Swellview.

345
00:21:38,731 --> 00:21:42,067
Yeah. I did the whole...
saving Swellview thing.

346
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:44,603
I just-- I didn't actually die.

347
00:21:44,604 --> 00:21:46,071
[laughs]

348
00:21:46,072 --> 00:21:48,641
I kinda, you know...

349
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,478
Well, I faked it.

350
00:21:51,611 --> 00:21:53,546
Changed my last name
and disappeared.

351
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:56,582
Oh, shut up! You've been
alive this whole time?

352
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,485
I mean...[small laugh] yeah.

353
00:21:58,618 --> 00:22:00,520
Do you have any idea
how traumatized we were

354
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,990
- by your death?
- Uh, well, I'm sorry.

355
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,157
Okay?

356
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:12,365
I wanted to move on
with my life,

357
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,934
and protect my family.

358
00:22:15,034 --> 00:22:17,837
Which is a lot easier if all
your enemies think you're dead.

359
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:20,305
Well, all your fans
thought you were dead too.

360
00:22:20,306 --> 00:22:21,708
Yeah, well, good news.

361
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,412
[exhales] I'm still alive.

362
00:22:26,646 --> 00:22:28,515
Did you have me fighting
a dinosaur?

363
00:22:28,615 --> 00:22:29,916
Oh!

364
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,719
- Oh, where have you been?
- Fighting crime in Dystopia.

365
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,654
No, wait, Dystopia?
That's amazing!

366
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,523
Wait. What the gunch
is Dystopia?

367
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:39,025
It's like an island
in the Pacific Ocean.

368
00:22:39,158 --> 00:22:41,327
Oh, my gosh. Are Jasper
and Charlotte there too?

369
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:44,330
Wait. How do you know
about Jasper and Charlotte?

370
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:46,666
Well, I figured out
your secret identity.

371
00:22:50,069 --> 00:22:51,303
[shrill shriek]

372
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:54,373
Uh-- [clears throat]
how-how, uh-- [laughs]

373
00:22:54,507 --> 00:22:55,974
how do you--
how do you know that?

374
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:58,578
Your eye mask covered
less than a pair of sunglasses.

375
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,848
I'm honestly shocked
nobody else figured it out.

376
00:23:01,981 --> 00:23:03,750
Yeah, well,
Swellview's not exactly

377
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:05,151
the smartest town in America.

378
00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:06,419
What am I doing here?

379
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,758
I brought you here so that
we could fight crime together.

380
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:17,464
And, bro, there is
so much crime in Newtown.

381
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:20,365
You don't even know.

382
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:23,269
Most days, Gemma and I
barely make it home from school.

383
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:26,138
Go. Go, go, go.

384
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,985
[man] Hey.

385
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,889
[laughing]

386
00:23:43,022 --> 00:23:45,357
Good thing we hid our tablets
under our shirts.

387
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,296
Dang it, Gemma.

388
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,498
[man] Come on.

389
00:23:51,631 --> 00:23:54,166
- This is nice.
- The latest model. Yeah.

390
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,803
[distant police siren wailing]

391
00:23:56,903 --> 00:23:59,539
Hello. None of you
could have helped us?

392
00:23:59,639 --> 00:24:02,141
[man] That's why
we don't come down here.

393
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,913
But now you're here,
so time's up, creeps.

394
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,981
Kid Danger's in Newtown.

395
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,986
Yeah. I gotta get back
to Dystopia.

396
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,523
Wait. You don't wanna
fight crime with me?

397
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:22,128
Look, you seem like a nice girl

398
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:26,098
and I'm always happy
to meet a fan, but...

399
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:27,934
I'm sorta doing my own thing
right now.

400
00:24:28,034 --> 00:24:31,470
And also, you shouldn't
use crazy devices

401
00:24:31,604 --> 00:24:33,773
to pull people
out of their worlds without,

402
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:35,341
you know, asking first.

403
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,411
It's really not cool.

404
00:24:39,512 --> 00:24:41,714
Again-- thought you were dead.

405
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,684
Never thought you'd lie
to all your fans, but...

406
00:24:44,817 --> 00:24:46,785
I mean, it's whatever.
If you wanna go back,

407
00:24:46,786 --> 00:24:49,455
- I'll send you back.
- I'd like that. Thank you.

408
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:53,025
[power up hum]

409
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:57,063
Also, I didn't lie
about not being dead, okay?

410
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,831
I faked it.

411
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,867
There's a big difference.

412
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,536
[woman] Help! I'm being crimed!

413
00:25:06,438 --> 00:25:08,040
[man growls]

414
00:25:08,174 --> 00:25:10,076
Weird.

415
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:13,813
I used the RAD to zerp you
into my regular life

416
00:25:13,913 --> 00:25:15,948
so that we could fight crime
together,

417
00:25:16,048 --> 00:25:19,685
but that guy looks exactly
like Coach Cregg.

418
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:22,254
He's a character
from one of my fan fictions.

419
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,657
Huh.

420
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:27,426
You gotta help her.

421
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,662
- Help! Hey, help!
- There's a mailman

422
00:25:30,663 --> 00:25:32,732
and some high school kids--
they'll help her.

423
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:35,067
Mailmen are famously nonviolent,
and we both know

424
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:37,937
that high school kids
are lazy and shiftless.

425
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:40,171
- Hey, mailman, help!
- [Cregg laughing]

426
00:25:40,172 --> 00:25:42,108
Mine.

427
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,244
- Cool.
- You've gotta do it.

428
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,179
I gotta get back to Dystopia.

429
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,449
"A superhero
always answers the call."

430
00:25:50,583 --> 00:25:52,084
[triumphant chords]

431
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:55,655
What-- who are you?
Who talks like that?

432
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:58,090
You do.

433
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,426
After you defeated
the Beekeeper.

434
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:02,261
What?

435
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,163
Oh. [laughs] I...

436
00:26:04,263 --> 00:26:07,266
I remember now.
Me and Captain Man made a bet

437
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,435
to see who could come up with
the cheesiest line

438
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,070
in post-fight interviews.

439
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:13,940
"A superhero
always answers the call."

440
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:17,276
Oh, my God. Okay. You know what?
I'll take care of it.

441
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:19,445
- I'll take care of, uh--
- Coach Cregg.

442
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:22,148
I'll take care of Coach Cregg,
then you send me home.

443
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,250
Yes! Fighting with Kid Danger.

444
00:26:24,383 --> 00:26:27,186
- The two of us living the dream.
- No, I'm gonna do this myself.

445
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:30,255
Wait, no, no, no, no, no.
You have to take me with you.

446
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,959
This is literally
my dream come true.

447
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:37,463
- You have any work experience?
- [scoffs] Dude, I'm 12.

448
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,066
- Superpowers?
- Uh, stealing stuff.

449
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,936
- Yeah, you should stay here.
- Wait, no, no.

450
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:46,906
You didn't see how many guards
I clowned to steal that thing.

451
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:48,407
It-it was impressive.

452
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,978
Look, I, uh, kinda just got out
of a crime-fighting relationship

453
00:26:52,111 --> 00:26:55,715
so I really just wanna
work alone, all right?

454
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,116
- 'Scuse me.
- What-- hey--

455
00:26:57,249 --> 00:27:00,186
Plus, he's just some
roided-out gym teacher.

456
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:02,088
Probably won't even
use my superpower.

457
00:27:02,221 --> 00:27:04,356
Ooh-- oof--ooh!

458
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,325
Still don't want me to help?

459
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:09,795
- Nope. Just need my superpower.
- Okay, hear me out on this,

460
00:27:09,796 --> 00:27:11,664
but I think we're in
one of my fan fictions.

461
00:27:11,831 --> 00:27:14,100
- What makes you say that?
- I linked the RAD's

462
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,835
protocol systems to mine.

463
00:27:15,935 --> 00:27:18,104
I might have logged in
as an administrator

464
00:27:18,204 --> 00:27:20,006
- instead of a guest...
- You've been working out.

465
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,108
- And also there was a lot of...
- [whack, grunt]

466
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,276
...lightning and also, also,
you're getting your butt kicked

467
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,945
by one of my fictional
characters?

468
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:27,980
'Sup?

469
00:27:28,114 --> 00:27:30,549
And you don't have
your superpower.

470
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,118
Yeah, I didn't quite follow
that,

and kidnap <i>my</i> sister.

00:49:26,831 --> 00:49:28,633
- Let me talk to her.
- Uh-uh--

943
00:49:28,733 --> 00:49:31,036
Hey! Piper.

944
00:49:31,202 --> 00:49:33,171
What's going on?

945
00:49:34,405 --> 00:49:36,574
It's me, your big bro?

946
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,279
Why-- why you looking at me
like that?

947
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:45,050
[hissing]

948
00:49:45,183 --> 00:49:47,552
Slay. The house. Down.

949
00:49:47,718 --> 00:49:48,719
Go, go, go.

950
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:50,455
You are a whole vibe.

951
00:49:50,555 --> 00:49:51,956
It's giving...

952
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:54,025
evil vampire realness.

953
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,727
It's giving undead
majestic queen.

954
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,064
It's giving hot girl vamp power!

955
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:01,566
Honey, you can drink my blood
anytime.

956
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,068
Don't look.

957
00:50:05,503 --> 00:50:06,737
- [hisses]
- Ow!

958
00:50:07,805 --> 00:50:10,375
I didn't actually mean that!

959

[dark music plays]

[singsong] Oh, kiddies.

00:50:32,397 --> 00:50:34,932
Care to join Bite Club?

964
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:39,003
It's... to die for. [hissing]

965
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,939
- This is not good.
- At least Frankini's not whining

966
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:44,475
- about his party anymore.
- That's what I mean.

967
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,944
She twisted his mind.
Now all he cares about

968
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,280
is turning other people
into vampires.

969
00:50:49,414 --> 00:50:50,881
[Vampiper] Henry...

970
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:54,919
Don't you want to fang out
with us?

971
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:58,589
Come out, come out, we're...

972
00:50:58,723 --> 00:51:00,425
bloody fantastic.

973
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:03,661
See? If they bite us,
we'll turn into vampires.

974
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:06,530
Our minds will change,
and we'll never wanna go back

975
00:51:06,531 --> 00:51:08,633
to the real world ever again.

976
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:12,137
We'll be stuck in this reality
forever.

977
00:51:12,270 --> 00:51:13,971
This is bad.

978
00:51:14,105 --> 00:51:16,207
Just need a second to think--

Don't worry. I locked the door.

- [grunts]

Okay, now you should worry.

983
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:33,224
Where does that contraption
take you?

984
00:51:33,358 --> 00:51:35,759
- [Missy] Other worlds, kinda.
- Nowhere.

985
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:38,396
Don't tell them that.

986
00:51:38,496 --> 00:51:40,498
Other worlds...

- to conquer?
- You'd hate 'em.

988
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,602
You should probably stay here
and not turn anybody else

00:51:44,702 --> 00:51:45,636
into vampires.

990

- Uh...

00:51:48,173 --> 00:51:49,507
no.

992
00:51:52,743 --> 00:51:53,778
Huh.

993
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,947
I want that.

00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:03,554
Oh, that was close.

where are we?

[Piper] Uh, I don't know yet.

00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:16,301
Well, at least we're safe.

00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,968
Henry, look out! Oh--

Oh ha ha. Mother goose.

The Mounties are back,
and they got weapons.

Let's keep close
to the barricades.

1004

- "The Mounties"?
- Oh, God.

1005
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:30,615
It's The Syrup Wars.

1006
00:52:30,748 --> 00:52:33,351
Why can't you write one
where we chill on the couch?

1007
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:35,353
Because The Couch Wars
would be boring.

1008
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:37,054
Not to me.

[intense music plays]

- Just walk away, eh?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1011

Just walk away, and we will
give you safe passage, eh?

1012
00:52:47,198 --> 00:52:49,500
Just walk away
and we'll let you live.

1013
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:52,437
Just walk away and leave
your liquid gold behind.

1014
00:52:52,537 --> 00:52:55,706
- Ah, ah-- <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>
- Yeah. Please.

1015
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,141
Liquid gold?

1016
00:52:57,275 --> 00:52:59,076
Maple syrup.

1017
00:52:59,244 --> 00:53:02,947
In this story, a nuclear war
has scorched the entire planet.

1018
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:05,416
The people left behind
scrape out a brutal existence,

1019
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:08,719
scavenging for the leftovers
of human civilization.

1020
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:12,357
That right there is the last bit
of maple syrup left on Earth.

1021
00:53:12,457 --> 00:53:15,360
We got it.
The Canadian Mounties want it.

1022
00:53:16,227 --> 00:53:18,763
Are any of your fan fictions
not totally weird?

1023

- [indistinct chatter]
- No.

Ah ha ha!

1027
00:53:26,304 --> 00:53:29,674
- We're very sorry about that.
- Yeah, we're very sorry, eh?

1028
00:53:29,774 --> 00:53:32,777
Yeah. We apologize
for our use of violence,

1029
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:35,380
but us Mounties, we need syrup!

1030
00:53:35,513 --> 00:53:37,948
Don't Mounties need horses?

1031
00:53:38,082 --> 00:53:41,051
They all took off during the war
'cause you ran outta syrup.

1032
00:53:41,185 --> 00:53:43,187
We got plenty of
fresh flapjacks out here,

1033
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:45,423
but we can't eat 'em
without syrup, eh?

1034
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,857
Just eat 'em dry.

- You're rude!
- ...when I do that?

1039

We don't have any syrup, eh?
Wah!

- Yeah! He doesn't like it!

It's so dry, yeah?

Crumble 'em in your mouth
and cry

- [all] You eat 'em dry!

1044
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:06,444
- No, you eat 'em dry.
- Let's just give them the syrup.

1045
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:10,046
Then we can find Schwoz.
He can fix the RAD,

1046
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:11,516
and we can get back to reality.

1047
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,718
Because in this story,
we're waiting for "the Big Guy"

1048
00:54:13,818 --> 00:54:16,420
to come with the truck that can
haul the syrup to California.

1049
00:54:16,421 --> 00:54:18,221
We'll eat flapjacks with syrup
for a week

1050
00:54:18,222 --> 00:54:20,691
before the Earth crashes
into the sun.

1051
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,461
I'm seriously worried about you.

1052
00:54:23,628 --> 00:54:26,163
I'm in a much better place now.

1053
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:29,098
All right, we're outta weapons
and food, and those Mounties

1054
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,869
aren't going away
without a fight. You guys in?

1055
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,638
Ooh!

1056

- [whistling sound]
- Watch out, Henry.

- I'm in.
- Yep.

1062
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:52,189
- Aw. You guys are good friends.
- Yeah, well,

1063
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:54,624
we're actually not that
good of friends in Dystopia,

1064
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:57,027
but I'm not gonna leave him
to the syrup-crazed Mounties.

1065
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:59,430
What's Dystopia? What do you
mean we're not friends?

1066
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:01,666
What's that thing on your arm?
And what do you mean,

1067
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:04,034
we're not friends?

1068
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:06,337
Okay. This is gonna sound crazy.

1069
00:55:08,506 --> 00:55:10,775
So if there is a Schwoz
in this world,

1070
00:55:10,875 --> 00:55:13,277
and if we can find him,
then maybe he can help us

1071
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:16,847
fix our RAD and get me and Henry
back to where we belong.

1072
00:55:17,848 --> 00:55:19,884
So, in this other world,

1073
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,886
there's probably
a pretty good reason

1074
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:24,054
why we're not friends anymore, right?

1075
00:55:24,188 --> 00:55:27,958
Like, I-I probably did
something terrible, right?

1076
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,395
I kinda just...

1077

1078
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,332
You got busy?

- And famous.

Ow. Oof.

1081
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,640
Not really any of my business,
but all he seems to do

1082
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:44,241
is save your life
over and over again,

1083
00:55:44,375 --> 00:55:47,478
but you're just too busy and
famous to be friends with him?

1084
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:51,048
Relax, okay? He hasn't saved my
life as much back in Dystopia.

1085
00:55:51,148 --> 00:55:52,750
What--

1086
00:55:52,850 --> 00:55:54,419
Whatever, all right?

1087
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:56,853
You guys can go and find
this Schwoz guy.

00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:58,188
Get your thing fixed,

1089
00:55:58,288 --> 00:55:59,990
and I'll fight the Mounties
by myself.
