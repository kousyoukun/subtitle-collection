麥克不知去那裡了

00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,110
你明天會打電話給我吧？

18
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,810
好，一定 你保證？

19
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,810
保證
Yeah.

10月30日，1978年

24
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,280
你以前有沒有處理過這種事？
Ever done anything like this before?

25
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,380
只有在安全限度之內
Only minimum security.

26
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:13,180
了解了
I see.

入口在右邊幾百碼處
The driveway's a few hundred yards up on the right.

28
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,580
我唯一擔心的是他們激動的時候
The only thing that ever bothers me is their jibberish.

29
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:27,280
會不停的發出各種奇怪的聲言
When they start raving on and on ...

30
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,980
不必擔心這個
You haven't anything to worry about.

31
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,790
他已經有15年沒說過話了
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.

32
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,490
有沒有要特別注意的事？
Are there any special instructions?

33
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,890
只要清楚我們是在處理什麼事就好
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here.

34
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,980
不要掉以輕心
Don't underestimate it.

35
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,990
你不認為我們和他一樣也正在期待著這件事？
Don't you think we could refer to 'it' as him?

36
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,490
你要這樣說也可以
If you say so.

37
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,180
你的同情心在作祟，大夫
Your compassion's overwhelming, Doctor.

38
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,980
在帶他去見法官之前，我還為他做點什麼？
What do I give him,
when we're taking him in front of the judge?

39
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,980
想法奇怪
Thorazin.

40
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:07,990
這樣根本解決不了問題
我也是這麼認為
Barely be able to sit up.
That's the idea.

41
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,890
你這次很認真，是不是？
You're serious about that, aren't you?

42
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,280
是的
Yeah.

43
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,780
你是說你實在不希望放他出來
不希望
You mean, you actually never want him to get out.
Never ever ...

44
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,380
絕不希望
Never.

45
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:34,880
那為什麼我們還要帶他去哈地郡？
因為法律這樣規定
Then why we're taking up to Hardy county,if he just gonna ...
Because that is the law.

46
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,680
到了
We are.

47
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,580
他們什麼時候開始可以四處閒逛的？
Since when do they let them wander around?

48
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,390
到大門去 - 我們不是應該去 - 快走
Pull up to the main gate.
Shouldn't we ...  Pull up?

49
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,280
停車
Stop here.

50
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,990
我們不是應該直接去醫院的嗎？
在這裡等著
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital on ...
Wait!

51
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,290
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

52
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,990
你沒事吧？- 我沒事 - 他跑了
You all right?
- Yes, I'm ok. - He's gone. He's gone?

53
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:14,580
這混蛋跑了
The evil is gone!

54
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,080
我得趕緊
I gotta ...

55
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,980
海德非斯，伊利諾州

56
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,150
萬聖節
海德非斯，伊利諾州

57
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:43,530
萬聖節

58
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:22,790
別忘了拿鎖匙去麥爾家
Don't forget to drop the key off the Myers place ...

59
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,680
好的
I won't.

60
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:29,680
他們會在10點半來看房子把它放在門口被子下面
我會的
They're coming by look at the house at 10:30.Be sure you leave it under the mat ...
Promise.

61
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,180
勞莉
Laurie ...

62
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:07,490
嗨，湯米
Hi Tommy.

63
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,790
今晚你來嗎？
同一時間，同一地點
Coming over tonight?
Same time, same place.

64
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,790
我們能做傑克燈籠嗎？
當然可以
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Sure.

65
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,990
然後看恐怖電影？
對
And watch the monster movies?
- Sure.

66
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,280
你會念書給我聽嗎？
Will you read to me?

67
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,390
能做爆米花嗎？
當然，當然，當然
Can we make popcorn?
- Sure, sure, sure.

68
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,490
你最好走快點
You better hurry up.

69
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:30,280
你怎麼走這條路上學？
我爸爸叫我走的
How can you walk in the school this way?
My dad asked me to.

70
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,480
為什麼？
Why?

71
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,890
我要留鎖匙
I have to drop off the key.

72
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:33,980
為什麼？
Why?

73
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,480
因為他要賣房子
Because he's gonna sell a house.

74
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,680
為什麼？
Why?

75
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,780
因為那是他的工作
哪套房子？
Because that's his job.
Where?

76
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,190
麥爾家的房子
The Meyers house.

77
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,890
麥爾家的房子！
The Meyers house!

78
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,680
你最好不要到那裡去
You're not supposed to go up there?

79
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,090
不，我要去
Yes, I am.

80
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:57,080
那是鬼屋
That's a spook house.

81
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,990
看著吧！
Just watch.

82
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,080
郎尼從來不敢進去
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.

83
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,980
郎尼說那是鬼屋
Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house.

84
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,880
他說那裡面發生過恐怖的事
- 郎尼大概升不到六年級
He said real awful stuff happened there once.
- Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.

85
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,280
我必須走了
I gotta go.

86
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,480
晚上見
I see you tonight.

87
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,390
再見！再見！
Bye.  Bye.

88
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,480
* 多希望能一直陪伴著你 *
* I wish I had you all alone ... *

89
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,980
* 只有我們兩人 *
* Just the two of us ... *

90
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:40,990
* 我會擁你入懷 *
* I would hold you close to me ... *

91
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:44,590
* 緊緊擁抱著 *
* So close to me ... *

92
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
* 只有我們兩人 *
* Just the two ... *

93
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,280
這不是我的責任，山姆
噢，不
I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no ...

94
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,480
我跟他們說過他有多危險
I told them how dangerous he was!

95
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:59,180
你應該設置路障 那小圍壁連5歲小孩都阻止不了
You wouldn't have enough two roadblocks
and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

96
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,280
但他是你的病人，大夫
如果他很強壯，你應該告訴大家
But he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions
weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody.

97
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:03,780
我跟每個人都說過了！
I told everybody!

98
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,390
但沒人聽我的話
那我就無能為力了
Nobody listened.
- There's nothing else I can do.

99
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,680
你最好回去再打個電話
You can get back in there
and get back on the telephone.

100
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,790
告訴他們昨晚什麼人逃走了
Tell them exactly
who walked out of here last night ...

101
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,380
告訴他們他會逃到哪裡
也許只是逃走而己
And tell them exactly where he is going.
- Probably going.

102
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,680
我好像在浪費口舌
山姆，他家離這裡150里
I'm wasting my time. - Sam, Haddonfield is
a hundred and fifty miles away from here.

103
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,580
而且，老實說，他不會開車
他昨晚開得相當好！
Now, now for God's sake, he can't drive a car!
- He was doing very well last night!

104
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,990
一定是這裡的人教他的
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

105
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,090
到了這裡這本書就結束了
... and the book ends.

106
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:41,680
但其實撒母耳要說的是
But what Samuels is really talking about here ...

107
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,490
命運
is fate.

108
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,480
各位知道
You see ...

109
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:49,790
書裡命運跟很多人都有關
fate caught up with several lives here.

110
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,780
不論科林斯採取什麼樣的行動
No matter what course of action Collins took ...

111
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:58,480
他都擺脫不了命運的束縛
he was destined to his own fate,

112
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,490
每一天都是命運的安排
his own day of reckoning with himself.

113
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,880
這
The idea ...

114
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,890
就像
is ...

115
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,890
天命
that destiny ...

116
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:13,780
是非常真實的，具體的東西
我們每個人都得處理好
is a very real, concrete thing
that every person has to deal with.

117
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:19,780
對於命運，撒母耳和卡斯提的觀點有什麼不同？勞莉？
How does Samuels' view of fate differ from that of Costaine's? Laurie?

118
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,380
叫我嗎？
M'am?

119
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,180
回答問題
Answer the question.

120
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,390
卡斯提寫到命運某些程度上跟信仰有關
Costaine wrote that fate was somehow related only to religion

121
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,180
而撒母耳認為那只是一種自然物
就像泥土，空氣，火和水一樣
or where Samuels felt that ... well, fate was like
a natural element, like earth, air, fire, and water.

122
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,880
對，撒母耳把命運人格化了
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate.

123
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,880
撒母耳寫到，命運是不可移動的，就像一座山
In Samuels' writing, fate is a moveable like a mountain.

124
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,380
對人來說是無法改變的
It stands, where man passes a way.

125
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,580
命運永遠不會改變
Fate never changes.

126
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,480
你，抱南瓜的 你們走開！
You, with pumpkin. Leave me alone!

127
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:17,880
他會捉到你的！捉到你的，捉到你的
He's gonna get you!
- He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...

128
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,680
惡魔人來了！快走開！
The boogeyman is coming! Leave me alone!

129
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,980
他大概不膽小
你知不知道萬聖節是什麼節日？
He doesn't believe us.
- Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

130
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,290
知道，有糖果吃
Yeah, we get candy.

131
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:34,090
惡魔人來了！惡魔人來了！惡魔人來了！
The boogey man!

他已經動身了
He's on his way.

135
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:19,380
我是他的醫生 你一定要有所準備
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

136
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:22,690
不信的話，那就準備棺材吧
If you don't, it's your funeral.

137
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,080
* 我們來自哈登菲爾德鎮，我們很自豪 *
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder.

00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,480

00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,790
* 我們來自哈登菲爾德鎮，我們很自豪 *
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder!

噢，看看你
Can't hear now ... continue

00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:32,490

Heeey Haddonfield!
- Yeah, one for me.

143
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,280
這真是趕死人了！早上有三個新的口號要學
You know it's totally insane! We have three new cheers to learn in the morning,

144
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:42,380
下午有球賽，5點要去做頭髮，然後8點去跳舞
the game in the afternoon, I have to get my hairdone at five and the dance is at eight.

145
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,290
我的時間都被用光了！
I'll be totally wiped out!

146
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:45,280
明天再做估計來不及
完全來不及
I don't think get enough to do tommorow.
Totally!

147
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,990
跟以前一樣，我似乎沒事做
這是你自己的錯，我不必同情你
As usual, I have nothing to do.
- It's your own fault and I don't feel bit sorry for you.

148
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,590
嘿，琳達，勞莉
Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

149
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,590
怎麼沒等我？
Why didn't you wait for me?

150
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,380
我們等了呀！
We did.

151
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:06,780
等了15分鐘 你根本沒出現
胡說！我這不是來了嗎？
Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed.
- That's not true. Here I am.

152
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,380
怎麼了，安妮？你臉上沒笑容
我永遠不會再笑了
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
- I'm never smiling again.

153
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:18,780
保羅帶我去男更衣室，然後開發神秘領域？
已經被完全開發過了
Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell ...
- Exploring uncharted territory?- It's been totally charted.

154
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,980
我們只是聊天
We just talked.

155
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,180
當然，當然
Sure, sure.

156
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,990
他因往窗戶扔雞蛋被人逮住了
然後他父母就不讓他出門了
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs
and soaping windows. His parents grounded him.

157
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,780
他今晚來不了了
He can't come over tonight.

158
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:31,780
你今晚不是要去當保姆嗎？她當保姆的唯一原因就是為了有個地方
噢，糟了
I thought you were babysitting tonight. The only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
Oh shit ...

159
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,990
我已經有地方了
I have a place for that.

160
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,490
我忘了化學課本
I forgot my chemistry book.

161
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:42,480
有什麼關係？我常忘了拿化學課本，數學課本，英語課本
So, who cares? I always forget my chemistry book
and my math book and my english book and my ...

162
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,290
有時候法語課本
and let's see my French book and ...

163
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:48,780
其實沒有書也沒關係 我根本不需要這些書
我真希望把這些書都丟掉
Who needs books anyway? I don't need books.
I always forget all of my books. I mean ...

164
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:51,080
有沒有帶書回去根本不要緊
it doesn't really matter if I you got that books or not.

165
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,480
那不是范格拉漢姆嗎？
Hey, isn't that the van Graham?

166
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:57,680
我想不是
I don't think so.

167
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,980
他長得很帥
I think he's cute.

168
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:05,790
嘿，怪人！
Hey, jerk ...

169
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,490
馬路殺手！
Speed kills!

170
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,580
糟了，他不能開玩笑？
Gosh ... Can't he take a joke?

171
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:31,080
安妮，你總有一天會給我們惹禍的
You know, Annie, some day
you gonna get us all into deep trouble.

172
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,480
真的
Totally.

173
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,990
我不喜歡沒有幽默感的人
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.

174
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,680
今晚我們還是照舊？
Well, are we still on for tonight?

175
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,680
我不想給你惹麻煩，琳達
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

176
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,380
別這樣，安妮
Oh come on, Annie ...

177
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,780
巴伯和我已經計劃了一個星期了
Bob and I've been planning on it all week.

178
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,280
好吧！
All right.

179
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,680
華萊士夫婦七點離開家
The Wallaces leave at seven.

180
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,980
我要去道爾家當保姆
I'm babysitting the Doyles.

181
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,990
只隔了三套房子遠，我們可以一起玩了
太好了，我有三樣選擇
It's only three houses down. We can keep each other
company. - Ohh, terrific ... I've got three choices.

182
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:05,280
照顧小孩睡覺，和琳達鬼混，還有跟你聊天
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
screw around or talk to you.

183
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:11,080

184
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,380
這裡
Here.

185
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,080
晚上什麼時候？
What time at night?

186
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:48,380
還不知道 我必須把我的小弟弄走然後和和巴伯一起！
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little
brother trick- or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob?

187
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:49,590
真幽默！
Fun-ny.

188
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,790
再見！
再見！- 再見！

- Bye. - Bye.

189
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,280
安妮，看
Annie, look.

190
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,980
看什麼？
Look where?

191
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,380
樹林後面
Behind the bush.

192
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:14,780
我沒看到東西
那個剛才開車的，被你吼的那個
I don't see anything.
- That guy who drove by so fast, when you yelled at.

193
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,390
他很敏感，是不是？
Subtle, isn't he?

194
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:26,280
嘿，混蛋！
Hey, creep!

195
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:32,580
勞莉，親愛的，他想和你說話
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.

196
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,880
他晚上想和你約會
He wants to take you out tonight.

197
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,980
他剛才站在這裡
He was standing right there.

198
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,680
可憐的勞莉
Poor Laurie.

199
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,990
你又失去了一個機會
Scared another one away.

200
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:59,180
真可悲，你永遠無法和男孩約會
It's tragic. You never go out.

201
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:04,290
你不應該整天幫別人看孩子
別人覺得我聰明
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting
so much. - Guys think I'm too smart.

202
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:08,280
我認為你太怪異了 竟然在樹叢後看到一個人
I don't. I think you're whacko.Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

203
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,290
溫暖的家到了
Well, home sweet home.

204
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,380
待會見
See you later.

205
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,780
再見
Bye.

206
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:36,780
對不起，勞莉
布萊克先生，對不起  我不是有意嚇你的
Excuse me, Laurie. - Oh, Mr. Brackett,
I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett. - Oh, I didn't mean to scary ya.

207
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,990
對不起
I'm sorry.

208
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,180
今天是萬聖節 我想每個人都預期會被嚇一嚇
You know, it's Halloween.
I guess everybody's entitled to a one good scare.

209
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,590
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

210
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:45,080
很高興見到你，先生
Nice evening, sir.

211
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,290
不給糖就搗亂 不給糖就搗亂
Trick -o - treat, Trick -o - treat.

212
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,580
小孩子
Oh, kiddo ...

213
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,890
都是在迷信中長大的
thought you grew up from superstition.

214
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,480
哈囉？
Hello?

215
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,290
哈囉？
Hello?

216
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,690
到底是誰？
Who is this?

217
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:43,690
哈囉？
Hello?

218
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,180
為什麼掛斷電話？
Why did you hang up on me?

219
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:45,980
安妮？
Annie?

220
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,280
剛才是你嗎？
Was that you?

221
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,380
是呀！
怎麼不說話，嚇死我了
Of course.
- Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.

222
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,380
我嘴裡塞滿了吃的 你聽到了嗎？
had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

223
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,280
我以為是恐嚇電話
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

224
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:59,090
你聽到我只是在吃東西，抱歉
我沒聽清楚
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
- I've already lost it.

225
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,980
我懷疑
I Doubt that.

226
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:03,380
聽好了，我媽要借車給我，我六點半來接你
Listen, my mother is letting me use her car.
I'll pick you up. 6:30.

227
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,780
好，再見！

00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,880
冷靜
Just calm down.

229
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,880
真荒謬
This is ridiculous.

230
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,180
快進來
Hurry up.

231
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,390
還有點時間
Just have time.

232
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:07,080
朱迪絲麥爾 麥爾
Judith Myers. Myers.

233
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
第18排第20個

234
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,290
你可知道這種事經常發生
Hey, you know. You know,
every town has something like this happen.

235
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,880
我記得在羅素維爾鎮

236
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,280
查理包爾 大概在15年前

到停車庫

240
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:32,980
拿了一把斧頭
He got himself a hack saw ...

241
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,980
回到房裡

242
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,880
和他的太太和二個孩子吻別

243
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,780
然後就 到了嗎？

244
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,980
在這裡

246
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,080
簡直無法相信
Couldn't believe.

247
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,780
這麼小的男孩
Such a young boy.

248
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,280
迷路了嗎？
Well, you lost?

249
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,980
他們為什麼這麼做？
Why do they do it?

250
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,790
這些小鬼
Goddamn kids.

251
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,690
在萬聖節他們什麼事都幹得出來
They'll do anything for Halloweens.

252
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,790
這是墓碑
噢，我知道
It was grave, hers.
- Oh, I know that.

你還在幻想嗎？

257
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,380
我沒有幻想
I wasn't spooked.

258
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,290
你胡說
我沒有

我看到有人在李德先生的後院

- Probably Mr. Riddle.

260
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:37,680
他在看著我
李德先生看著你？勞莉，李德先生已經87歲了
He was watching me.
- Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

261
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,980
他還是可以看的呀！
He can still watch.

262
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,880
可能他所能做的只是看看而己
That's probably all he can do.

263
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:47,380
這南瓜是用來做什麼的？
幫湯米帶的 他大概要做個傑克燈籠 這能讓他忙一陣子
What's the pumkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured
carving a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

264
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:50,290
我們應該弄個精彩的女童軍遊戲
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.

265
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:53,980
謝謝
老實說，今晚我都要演女童軍
Thanks. - And for that matter,
I might as well be a girl scout myself tonight.

266
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:57,480
我計劃做爆米花，然後看《痴呆醫生》
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Doctor Demensia.

267
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,380
六個小時的恐怖電影，小林西肯定會嚇一大跳
Six straight hours of horror movies.
Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.

268
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,280
我爸
My dad!

269
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,580
快丟掉
Get rid of this.

270
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
勞莉，別咳了，你怎麼回事？
Laurie, stop caughing. What's the matter with you?

271
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,880
自然一點，他在那裡
Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie.

272
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,980
安妮，勞莉
Hi, Annie, Laurie...

273
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,890
嗨，爸爸
Hi, Dad.

274
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:42,380
什麼事？ 什麼？
What happened?  What? What happened?

275
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:45,580
有人硬闖進了那間倉庫 可能是小孩
Somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

276
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,780
你把任何事都怪在小孩頭上
You blame everything on kids.

277
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:53,380
他們拿走了一些萬聖節面具，一條繩子，還有幾把小刀
要不然你認為是誰做的？
What all they took was some Halloween masks, a rope
and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was?

278
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,780
很難跟這位偏執的老爸溝通
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

279
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,780
你要遲到了吧？
什麼？
Aren't you gonna be late ...
- Huh?

280
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:02,790
我說你要遲到了
他又在吼了
I said aren't you gonna be late.
- He shouts too.

281
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,780
再見！孩子們
Bye girls.

282
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:09,680
再見！爸爸
再見
Bye dad.
- Bye.

283
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,980
警長
Sheriff.

284
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:23,080
打擾了，我是盧米斯，山姆盧米斯醫生
Pardon me, I'm a Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

285
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,780
李布蘭提
- 如果可以，我想和你說幾句
Lee Brackett.
- I, I'd like to have a word with you if I could.

286
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,980
好，稍等幾分鐘，我得拿那個
這事很重要
Ah, maybe a few minutes. I gotta take that
- It's just important.

287
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,480
等十分鐘
我在這裡等
Ten minutes.
- I'll be here.

288
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:49,390
你怎麼了？
What's the matter with you?

289
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,390
我想他知道了，他聞得出來
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

290
00:33:51,390 --> 00:33:53,680
他聞不出來的
他一定聞出來了
No, he didn't.
- He did.

291
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,290
看到他的表情了嗎？
See the look on his face?

292
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,190
他一向都是那種表情
He always looks like that.

293
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,880
你明晚舞會穿什麼衣服？
What  you gonna wear on dance tommorow night?

294
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,490
我沒想到你會問這問題，勞莉
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.

295
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,980
要知道你可以去請別人
- 不，我不行
You know you could ask somebody.
- No, I couldn't.

296
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,580
你當然可以，你只要過去說
Sure you could.
All you have to do is go up to somebody and say ...

297
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,480
你想跳舞嗎？
You wanna go to the dance?

298
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,780
你可以，我不行
You could do that, I couldn't.

299
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:26,990
或者你去約迪克帕西特 他會來的
Or you could ask Dick Paxter.
He could go out with ya.

300
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,480
那我寧願約班催莫
I try to get out Ben Tramor.

301
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,890
班催莫？
Ben Tramor?

302
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,290
我就知道！
I knew it!

303
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:39,780
你一直這樣想，對吧，勞莉？
See, you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?

304
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:42,780
閉嘴！ 他很帥
Shut up. He is cute.

305
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,790
班催莫！
Ben Tramor.

306
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,680
好
Ok.

307
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,280
再見
Bye.

308
00:35:52,280 --> 00:36:02,990
不給糖就搗亂 不給糖就搗亂
Trick or treat, trick or treat:
give me something good to eat.

309
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,980
嗨 - 嗨，安妮，請進
- 今天怎麼樣？ - 還好，你呢？
Hi. - Hi Annie, come on in.
- How are you doing today? - Fine. How are you?

310
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:22,080
準備幾點睡？
九點
What time are you in your bed?
I'm being in bed by nine, ok.

311
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,380
玩得開心，親愛的
- 要乖啊
Have a good night, dear.
- Be a good girl.

312
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,280
再見！
Bye bye.
- Here.

313
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,990
有人住這裡嗎？
- 沒有，自從1963年發生那事後就沒人住了
Anybody lives here?
- No, not since 1963 when that happened.

314
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:58,980
這裡的人都認為這是棟凶宅，不乾淨
- 我也會這麼想的
Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
- They may be right.

315
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,780
看！ 什麼？
Look. What?

316
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,480
那是什麼？
What is that?

317
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:21,680
一隻狗
It's a dog.

318
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,180
還有熱度
Still warm.

319
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,880
他一定餓極了
He got hungry.

320
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:36,980
他已經瘋了
Could have been a skunk.

321
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,080
可能是
Could have.

322
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,980
正常人不會這樣
A man wouldn't do that ...

323
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,380
他不是正常人
This is not a man.

324
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,280
這就是案發現場
It happened in here.

325
00:38:21,890 --> 00:38:24,290
她當時坐在這裡
She was sitting right here ...

326
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,980
他可能從這個窗戶看到她
He could have seen her thru this window.

327
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,780
站在草坪上
Standing on the lawn ...

328
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,780
能看到這裡
He could have seen in side.

329
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,280
你一定以為我是
You must think of me ...

330
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,890
一個精神不正常的醫生
the very sinister doctor.

331
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,290
這是我的醫師執照
I do have a permit.

332
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,890
我覺得你好像很害怕
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

333
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,780
是的
Yes.

334
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,280
是的，我
Yeah, I'm a...

335
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:09,080
我在15年前見他時
我當時認為他己沒救
I met him ... fifteen years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.

336
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:16,680
沒有知覺，無法溝通
對生命和死亡沒有概念
No reason ... nowhere conscience, no understanding
in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death of ...

337
00:39:17,490 --> 00:39:20,190
沒有分出善惡的能力
good or evil, right or wrong.

338
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,190
我看到了這個
I met this ...

339
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,480
6歲小孩的那張
six year-old child with his ...

340
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,490
空洞，蒼白，沒有表情的臉
blank, pale, emotionless face, and ...

341
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,690
和那雙來自黑暗的
the blackest eyes ...

342
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,180
魔鬼般的眼睛
the Devil's eyes.

343
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,580
我花了八年的時間想和他溝通
I spent eight years trying to reach him ...

344
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,080
之後七年把他完全拘禁 因為我知道
and then another seven trying to keep him locked up,
because I realized that

345
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,980
這個男孩眼睛的後面是無窮無盡的
what was living behind that boy's eyes
was purely and simply...

346
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,790
邪惡
... evil.

347
00:39:48,290 --> 00:39:49,290
我們怎麼辦？
What do we do?

348
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,380
他今晚曾來過
He's been here once tonight ...

349
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,280
我想他會回來
I think he'll come back.

350
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,390
我在這裡等他
I'm gonna wait for him.

351
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,490
我認為應該通知廣播和電視台
- 不
I still think I should notify the radio and television.
- No.

352
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:05,180
這樣人們會恐慌，會到處找他，如此恐怕會打草驚蛇
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner, they
look for him on every house. Just tell your men to keep their ...

353
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:07,280
還是叫你的人保守機密，嚴密監視他的出沒
mouth shut and their eyes open.

354
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,780
一小時後我再回來看看
I'll check back in an hour.

355
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,580
亞瑟現在哭的很傷心
... oh now, cried Arthur.

356
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,390
“讓每個人都加入這場混戰！”
'Let no one pass this way without a fight!'

357
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,980
“就這樣”騎士大膽
'That's so,' said the knight

358
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,290
而又傲慢的說
in a bold and haughty manner.

359
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:35,080
我不喜歡那個故事
我以為亞瑟王是你最喜歡的
I don't like that story.
- I thought king Arthur was your favorite.

360
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,590
不再是了
Not anymore.

361
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,480
為什麼都藏在底下？
Why do you keep them under there?

362
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,490
媽媽不讓我留著
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

363
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:44,780
雷射超人
'Laser Man' ...

364
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:48,280
中子人，我知道為什麼了
'Neutron Man' ... I can understand why.

365
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,290
飛天超人
'Tarantula Man' ...

366
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
勞莉
Laurie ...

367
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,380
什麼是惡魔人？
what's the Boogeyman?

368
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,290
道爾公館
Doyle residence.

369
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:03,990
是我
嗨，安妮，你在做什麼？
It's me ...
- Hi Annie, what are you doing?

370
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,780
做爆米花
Making popcorn ...

371
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:07,580
取樂
Having fun ...

372
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:10,380
你一定也是一樣
Never mind, I'm sure you are.

373
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:13,880
我有一個好消息告訴你
I have big, big news for you ...

374
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,080
你等一下
Hold on a minute.

375
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,880
嗨 李斯特
Hi Lester...

376
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,380
我要被這隻惡犬咬得稀巴爛了
I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.

377
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,290
林西，快把這隻狗從廚房帶走
Lindsey ... get this dog out of the kitchen right now.

378
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:48,390
我恨那隻狗
是世界上它唯一不喜歡的人
I hate that dog ...
I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

379
00:41:48,890 --> 00:41:51,090
是什麼大好消息？
So, what is this big, big news?

380
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,280
如果我說你會參加明晚的舞會 你信不信？
What would you say if I told you that you were going
to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

381
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,890
我會說你拔錯電話號碼了
I would probably say you've got the wrong number.

382
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,180
好吧
Well ...

383
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,190
我剛才打電話給班催莫 告訴他你覺得他很有吸引力
I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited
when I told him how attracted you were to him.

384
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,390
噢，安妮
Oh, Annie ...

385
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:12,280
噢，不要，你不會真說了吧
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

386
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,380
你怎麼能這樣做？
How could you do that?

387
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,690
你怎麼打電話告訴他這些？
I mean how you just call him.
What do you mean it's easy?

388
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,180
我簡直不敢相信
I can't believe this.

389
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:23,090
我實在不應該把任何事都告訴你
I can't tell you anything.

390
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,590
你一定是在騙我的
Please tell me you didn't.

391
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,480
肯定是騙我的
Oh, you didn't.

392
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,880
好尷尬，我沒辦法見他了
勞莉，惡魔人在外面
Laurie ... - I'm so embarrassed, I couldn't even face him.
- Boogeyman is outside.

393
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,780
勞莉，就在那裡
等一下
Laurie ... out there.
- Hold on.

394
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,890
勞莉，惡魔人在外面，快看！
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look!

395
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:50,480
湯米，外面沒有人
Tommy, there is nobody outside.

396
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,780
去看電視
Go watch TV.

397
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,480
剛才是湯米
It's just Tommy.

398
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:57,490
噢，安妮
Oh, please, Annie ...

399
00:42:58,190 --> 00:42:59,690
你為什麼這樣做
You could do that.

400
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:05,290
很簡單，他喜歡你，你也喜歡他
你們需要的是一點推力
Look it's simple. You like him, he likes you.
All you need is a little push.

401
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,490
老實說，和他約會只會對你有好處
It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.

402
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,980
他媽的
Shit!

403
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,090
不不！我把衣服弄濕了
我一會再打給你
No, no, I just made a mess on myself.
I gotta call you back.

404
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,380
噢，倒霉！
Oh, yuck!

405
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,880
林西
Lindsey ...

406
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,990
我需要一件衣服
I need a robe.

407
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,480
林西
Lindsey ...

408
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,380
那狗又再叫了 我這樣會神經緊張的
Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.

409
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,690
沒事了
Never mind ...

410
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:15,780
他一定在約會
I guess he found a hot date.

411
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:06,780
什麼時候做傑克燈籠？
先把電影看完
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
- After the movie.

412
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:10,790
那我的故事書呢？
做完傑克燈籠再說
What about the rest of my comic books?
- After the Jack-O-Lantern.

413
00:45:10,980 --> 00:45:12,790
那惡魔人呢？
What about the boogeyman?

414
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,580
這東西不存在
There is no such thing.

415
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,890
瑞其說他今晚會來抓我
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.

416
00:45:16,890 --> 00:45:18,780
瑞其說什麼你都信嗎？
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?

417
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,590
不是
No.

418
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:24,490
湯米，萬聖節的夜晚，大家都想愚弄人
Tommy, Halloween night ...
it's when people play tricks on each other.

419
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,480
相信我，瑞其只是想嚇嚇你
It's all make believe.
I think Richie was just trying to scare you.

420
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,480
我看到惡魔人了 他就在外面
I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside.

421
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,290
外面沒有人
There was nobody outside.

422
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:35,380
有
那他長什麼樣子？
There was.
- What did he look like?

423
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,980
長得像惡魔！
The boogyeman!

424
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,790
這麼說沒有任何意義
We're not getting anywhere.

425
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,380
好吧
All right.

426
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,680
惡魔人只在萬聖節晚上出現，對吧？
The boogyeman can only come out
on Halloween night, right?

427
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:45,690
對
Right.

428
00:45:45,690 --> 00:45:48,980
那好，我整晚都在這裡，這樣你就不會害怕了吧
Welll, I'm here tonight.
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

429
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:51,090
你保證？
Promise?

430
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:52,590
我保證
Promise.

431
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:54,880
我們現在做傑克燈籠好嗎？
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?

432
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,280
走
Let's go.

433
00:46:19,890 --> 00:46:21,480
太棒了！
Hmm, terrific.

434
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,890
哈囉？
Hello?

435
00:46:41,890 --> 00:46:43,290
誰在那裡？
Who's there?

436
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:48,380
保羅，這又是你的惡作劇對吧？
Paul, is this one of your cheap pranks?

437
00:46:52,090 --> 00:46:53,280
也許不是
Guess not.

438
00:46:54,790 --> 00:46:56,990
今晚應該不會有人捉弄我
No tricks for Annie tonight.

439
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,380
林西
Lindsey!

440
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:19,280
林西，到這邊來！
Lindsey, come out here!

441
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:23,280
林西，我被反鎖在洗衣間了！開不了門！
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room! The door wouldn't open!

442
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,980
大家分頭找
Spread out everybody.

443
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,380
我們要弄清楚這個東西長什麼樣
We gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.

444
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,080
我的天
Holly cat.

445
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,880
嘿
對了
Hey.
- Yeah.

446
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:35,180
幾近完美 怎麼了？
Almost perfect.
What's wrong?

447
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:38,680
我們終於找到一個了 我們發現了源頭
We finally got one.
- We found a plain sourcer.

448
00:47:39,180 --> 00:47:41,890
林西，快去接電話，是保羅打來的
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone, it's Paul.

449
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,480
林西！
Lindsey!

450
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:47,880
林西！
Lindseeey!

451
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:08,580
不，沒有響應 - 博士，這些手指頭使從哪來的？
No, no answer. - Doctor, where are those fingers from?

452
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:10,380
我不清楚，史考特先生
哈囉？
I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Hallo?

453
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,280
嗨，林西，我是保羅，安妮在嗎？
Hi Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

454
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,580
在，她在
Yes, she is.

455
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,980
幫我找她，好不好？
Get her for me, will ya?

456
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:17,980
她在洗衣服
She's washing her clothes.

457
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,290
告訴她我來過電話，好嗎？
Look, just tell her it's me, ok?

458
00:48:20,490 --> 00:48:21,880
好
Ok.

459
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,180
安妮！保羅來電話了
Annie, Paul called!

460
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,780
你怎麼掛在那裡？
我知道
You locked yourself there.
- I know.

461
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:49,380
拉我一把，我被卡住了
Pull my foot. I'm stuck!

462
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:11,290
好了，不許跟別人提這件事
Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this.

463
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:32,490
她剛剛被窗給卡住了，現在回來了
She got stuck in a window. She'll be right here.

464
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:37,480
哈囉！
嗨，安妮
Hello?
Hi Annie.

465
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,680
噢，嗨，保羅
被卡住了，是真的嗎？
Oh, hi Paul.
Stuck, huh?

466
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:44,280
好了，不要說了，誰都會
沒錯，被窗卡住了
All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone.
Sure ... stuck in the widow.

467
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,890
沒錯，我也看見你卡在很多地方啊
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions!

468
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,280
我爸媽出去了
My parents are gone.

469
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,380
太好了，什麼時候出去的
Oh that's fabulous. When did they leave?

470
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,780
半小時前
這太好了
About half ago
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

471
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,980
你為什麼不走路過來？
So why don't you just walk over?

472
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:02,590
你來接我
現在不行，我在洗衣服
You coming pick me up.
- Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash.

473
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:08,390
那你沒穿
住口，混蛋，我穿衣服了，你滿腦子淨想那些
Oh shut up jerk. Can't, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

474
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:12,090
我覺得你才滿腦子想那些
胡說，我想到很多事情
I think that's all you ever think about.
- That's not true, I think about lots of things.

475
00:50:12,090 --> 00:50:16,080
為什麼我們不停止紙上談兵去實踐一下呢？
Now why don't we not stand here
talking about them and get down to doing them?

476
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:24,180
關好門，鎖緊窗戶，關掉燈
Lock your doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights.

477
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:27,980
別離開 一會你將看到奇蹟
我好怕
Don't go away ... cause here is a scene ...
- I'm scared.

478
00:50:28,390 --> 00:50:30,480
那你為什麼要坐在這麼暗的地方呢？
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

479
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,680
我不知道
走，去拿你的外套，我們去接保羅
I don't know.
- Well, come on get your coat.
We're going to pick up Paul.

480
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,990
我不想去
I don't want to.

481
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:41,390
林西，我以為我們互相了解對方
我想待在這看電影
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
- I want to stay here and watch this.

482
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:46,080
好，我帶你去湯米道爾家和他一起看電視，你不好？
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV
with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?

483
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,980
好呀！
那跟我走吧
Yes.
- Well, come with me.

484
00:50:54,380 --> 00:50:55,990
快點！
Come on! Hurry up.

485
00:51:21,890 --> 00:51:25,090
That strange that has to short it out.

486
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,880
嗨，湯米
Hi Tommy.

487
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,580
嗨
Hi.

488
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:31,890
請進，我們正在做傑克燈籠
但是我想看電視
Come on in. We're making a Jack-O-Lantern.
- You know I wanna watch TV.

489
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:35,090
安妮，來這邊
Annie, come in here.

490
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:39,380
...now the horrifying conclusion ...

491
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:41,580
... to ... the them.

492
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,290
噢，真迷人！
Oh, fancy.

493
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,680
今晚不是屬於我的
This has not been my night.

494
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:55,980
我不小心把牛奶潑在身上，衣服正在洗，我還卡在了窗上
我希望你能打電話給班，告訴他你只是在開玩笑
I spilled butter all over. My cloths are in the wash.I got stuck in a window.
I'd like you call Ben Tramer and tell him you're just fooling around.

495
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,990
不行 - 行的，你可以的
不行，他和麥克戈弗雷喝酒，很晚才回來
I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, he went drinking with
Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late.

496
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,780
你明天自己打電話給他
YOU'LL have to call him ... tomorrow.

497
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:06,090
況且我正要去接保羅
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

498
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,080
等一下
Wait a minute.

499
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:13,080
如果你幫我照顧小孩，我會考慮明早打電話給班催莫
If you watch her,
I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

500
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:14,480
成交
Deal.

501
00:52:15,980 --> 00:52:19,490
我以為保羅被禁足了
沒錯，這小子想辦法溜出來了
I thought Paul was grounded.
- He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

502
00:52:19,490 --> 00:52:23,390
我一小時後再打電話給你，好吧？
- 好
Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, ok?
- Yeah.

503
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:24,980
再見！
Bye.

504
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:31,380
女童軍的性格又表露無遺了
The old girl scout comes through again.

505
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:48,290
* 今夜，保羅，我什麼都給你 *
* My Paul ... I give you all *

506
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:56,980

507
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:32,290

* 我不會再晚了 *
* Oh, Paul ... *
*I can no longer stall... *

508
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:40,380
* 噢，保羅，噢，保羅 *
* 我不會再晚了 *
* Oh Paul. Oh Paul ...*
*I can no longer stall... *

509
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:43,580
* 親愛的保羅 *
* Dearly Paul ... *

510
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:46,780
* 我的保羅 *
* my Paul *

511
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:43,480
注意！
Attention ...

512
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,990
船長和其他人員準備器械
Captain and crew standby reverse polarity.

513
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:49,780
地點第8檢查站，在那裡降落
Standard class A security will be maintained upon landing.

514
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,980
直到所有人員出   我們就接收
And until further notice all land in and hold on.

515
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,090
完畢
That is all.

516
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:55,580
進入重力區域
Artificial gravity are ...

517
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,490
主要出入口封閉
ad lock cut primary coarse.

518
00:54:57,490 --> 00:54:58,980
出入口都封閉了，長官
Primary stature.

519
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:25,380
林西
Lindsey ...

520
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:26,990
林西
Lindseyyy ....

521
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,990
你在哪裡？
Where are you?

522
00:55:54,390 --> 00:56:00,780
我看到惡魔人了！他在外面！惡魔人在外面！
- 怎麼了？
There is the boogeyman! He is outside! Look, there is the boogeyman outside!
- What's wrong?

523
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:04,680
我看到惡魔人！真的 - 湯米，別吵了
在林西家那邊！- 你會把林西嚇哭的
I saw the boogeyman! I know that - Oh, Tommy stop it!
- But at Lindsey's! - You're scaring Lindsey.

524
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:08,380
他在那裡！
湯米，夠了！外面沒有人！
He's over there!
- Tommy, stop it! There is nobody out there!

525
00:56:08,790 --> 00:56:13,390
沒有惡魔人，如果你還吵
我就把電視關掉，拉你去睡覺
There's no boogeyman. And if you don't stop all this
I'll have to turn off the TV and send you to bed.

526
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:21,880
沒人相信我
我相信你，湯米
Nobody believes me.
- I believe you, Tommy.

527
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:54,890
我才不怕
I'm not afraid.

528
00:56:54,890 --> 00:56:56,180
吹牛
Bull.

529
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:57,980
我不怕
那就進去吧！
I'm not.
- Then go in.

530
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:06,890
膽小鬼
Chicken.

531
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:08,380
別發抖，進去吧！郎尼
Go ahead, Lonnie.

532
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:10,880
進去呀！
Go in!

533
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:14,890
嘿！
Hey!

534
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,090
嘿，郎尼
Hey, Lonnie ...

535
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:19,680
你最好別接近那裡
Get your ass away from there ...

536
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,280
老天
Jesus.

537
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,780
你還好吧？
Are you all right here?

538
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,280
還好
Yeah.

539
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:41,990
除了孩子們的嘻斗之外
似乎沒發生任何事
Well, nothing's going on except kids playing pranks,
trick or treating, partying, getting high.

540
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,280
我覺得你太小提大作了
I have the feeling you're way off on this.

541
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,480
你這樣想是不對的
但目前為止尚未證明我是錯的
You have the wrong feeling.
- You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

542
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:49,280
你還需要證明嗎？
What more do you need?

543
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:53,290
當然，要讓我整夜都藏在這樹叢的後面
靠說這些荒誕的東西還不夠
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk
to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.

544
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,780
我觀察他15年了
I, I, I watched him for fifteen years ...

545
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:59,780
他坐在房間裡，呆看著牆壁，不只是看著
sitting in a room, staring at a wall, not seeing the wall ...

546
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,290
甚至要看穿牆壁
looking past the wall

547
00:58:01,290 --> 00:58:04,690
如果你有這耐心
looking at ... THIS NIGHT inhumanly patient.

548
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:09,680
等一個神密，無聲的危險人物
waiting for some secret, silent alarm ...

549
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,290
等待他的出現
to trigger him off.

550
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:15,690
死亡己逼近你這個小鎮，警長
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

551
00:58:15,690 --> 00:58:18,890
你要嘛不理不睬，要嘛幫我阻止他
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.

552
00:58:19,390 --> 00:58:20,980
你又在說怪誕的事
More fancy talk.

553
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:23,290
大夫，你了解哈登菲爾德鎮嗎？
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

554
00:58:23,290 --> 00:58:24,380
家人
Families ...

555
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:27,580
孩子們，他們都成群結隊地在街道上上下下
Children ... all lined up in rows,
up and down these streets.

556
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,980
而你卻告訴我他們可能會有危險
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

557
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,590
很有可能
They could be.

558
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,990
好，今晚我和你待在這裡
All right, I'll stay with you out tonight ...

559
00:58:34,990 --> 00:58:37,280
就當作你說的不假
just on the chance that you're right.

560
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:38,890
就算你說的都是事實
And if you are right ...

561
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,780
你也要為他的逃跑負責
damn you for letting him go.

562
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,490
好，我告訴你，我們先進去，好吧？
然後我們談幾句話
So we gonna first, we'll go inside, right?
Then we just talk a little.

563
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:11,480
當安妮把林西支走時，我們就上樓到左邊第一個房間 了解了嗎？
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we'll
go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it?

564
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,790
首先我撕掉你的衣服
First I rip your clothes off ...

565
00:59:13,790 --> 00:59:17,490
不要撕我的胸衣，那很貴的，白痴
然後你撕掉我的衣服
Don't rip, my blouse is expensive, idiot.
- Then you rip my clothes off...

566
00:59:17,490 --> 00:59:20,390
然後我們把林西的衣服也撕掉
耶！我覺得我全明白了！
then we rip Lyndsey's cloth off. Yeah, I think I got it.

567
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,390
你全明白了
Totally.

568
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,980
巴伯，放我下來
Bob ... put me down.

569
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,880
放我下來，別鬧了
Put me down. This is totally silly.

570
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:48,080
放我下來
Put me down.

571
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,480
怎麼這麼暗
是呀！
Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

572
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:55,590
安妮！
Annie!

573
00:59:55,980 --> 00:59:59,280
安妮，我們來了
他們去哪了？
Annie, we're here!
- I wonder where they went.

574
00:59:59,780 --> 01:00:02,480
安妮可能帶林西出去了
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.

575
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:12,390
找找看有沒有留字條
Hey, let's look for a note.

576
01:00:12,690 --> 01:00:13,890
別找了
Let's not.

577
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,990
他會抓到你的
He's gonna get you ...

578
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:53,980
不，他抓不到
嘿，沒有誰要抓任何人 不要嚇人
No, he's not. - Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

579
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:12,580
今夜每個人都各得其所
Everybody's having good time tonight.

580
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,080
好，小鬼，下來要玩什麼？
All right, guys, what's next?

581
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:19,090
我們再多做點爆米花吧
不，已經夠多了 要不一起把電影看完吧？
Let's make more popcorn. - No, we had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

582
01:01:19,290 --> 01:01:20,290
好
Yeah.

583
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,480
好了， 把它放回去
All right, put it back on.

584
01:01:37,780 --> 01:01:39,180
道爾公館
Doyle house.

585
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,290
嗨，勞莉，怎麼樣了
Hi Laurie ... what's up?

586
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,490
我今晚才剛剛坐下來
I'm just setting down for the first time tonight.

587
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:45,980
嘿，安妮在你那裡嗎？
Hey ... is Annie around?

588
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:47,680
不在，她現在應該回去了
No, I thought she'd be home by now.

589
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,080
她說要去接保羅
她根本不在這裡
She went to pick up Paul.
- Well, she's totally not here.

590
01:01:52,880 --> 01:01:54,780
她大概去別地方了
She's probably stopped off some place.

591
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:58,780
她回去時讓她給我打個電話
林西在我這邊，我要知道何時叫她去睡覺
Have her call me when she gets home.
I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know
what time to put her to bed.

592
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:02,380
好，待會見
祝你愉快
Okay. Later.
- Have a good time.

593
01:02:02,380 --> 01:02:04,490
我們一定會很愉快的
We definetely will.

594
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:06,580
再見！
Bye.

595
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:13,490
林西晚上不會回來了
那太好了
Lindsey is gone for the night.
- Hey, now that's wonderful.

596
01:02:56,690 --> 01:02:58,780
媽的！又來了
Oh, shit! Not again.

597
01:02:58,780 --> 01:03:00,780
真受不了，這電話老是響個不停
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

598
01:03:01,390 --> 01:03:04,290
噢，我沒辦法讓你保持興奮，對嗎？
還是快接這破電話吧！
Oh, I can't keep you interested, huh?
- Just answer that damn phone.

599
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:07,280
不能接 要是華萊士夫婦打回來的怎麼辦？
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?

600
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:08,980
接了安妮可就麻煩了
We'd get Annie in trouble now.

601
01:03:13,380 --> 01:03:14,990
我們把話筒拿起來
Just take it off the hook.

602
01:03:49,690 --> 01:03:51,690
太棒了！
Fantastic.

603
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:56,880
太美了
是呀！
Totally.
- Yeah.

604
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:09,990
滿足了嗎？
Is that all you can say?

605
01:04:09,990 --> 01:04:10,780
是的
Yeah.

606
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,790
去拿瓶酒給我
應該你去拿給我
Go get me a beer.
- I thought you were gonna get me one.

607
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,880
快去
Yeaah.

608
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,980
我馬上回來
I'll be right back.

609
01:04:21,980 --> 01:04:24,180
不要把衣服穿上
Don't get dressed.

610
01:05:19,990 --> 01:05:20,990
安妮？
Annie?

611
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:23,280
保羅？
Paul?

612
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,380
林西你這王八蛋
Lynda, you asshole!

613
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:34,980
好了！琳達
Ok, Lynda.

614
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:36,080
出來吧！
Come on out.

615
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,590
我的酒呢？
Well, did you get my beer?

616
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,980
可愛，巴伯，你很可愛
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

617
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,880
看到你喜歡的東西了嗎？
See anything you like?

618
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,290
怎麼了？巴伯，你能脫掉那套衣服嗎？
What's the matter? Can I get your ghost, Bob?

619
01:07:22,790 --> 01:07:24,790
好了，別鬧了，我的啤酒呢？
All right, all right. Come on, where is my beer?

620
01:07:31,080 --> 01:07:32,780
你回答我好不好？
Ok, ain't answer me?

621
01:07:36,990 --> 01:07:38,490
好，你別回答了
Ok, don't answer me?

622
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:43,180
你真奇怪！我要打電話給勞莉
Oh, you're weird!
- I'm gonna call Laurie.

623
01:07:43,180 --> 01:07:45,790
我要打電話給勞莉
我要知道保羅和安妮去哪裡了
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.
I wanna know where Annie and Paul are.

624
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:47,280
這就不好玩了哦
This is going nowhere.

625
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,890
終於打來了
Finally.

626
01:07:58,880 --> 01:07:59,880
哈囉！
Hello.

627
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,090
哈囉？
Hello?

628
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:11,390
好了，安妮，上次是在吃東西
這次變成尖叫了？
All right, Annie. First I get your famous chewing,
now I get your famous squealing?

629
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,080
安妮，你沒事吧？
Annie, you all right?

630
01:08:27,180 --> 01:08:28,990
你是不是又在開玩笑？
Are you fooling around again?

631
01:08:30,490 --> 01:08:32,280
如果又在開玩笑，我會殺了你
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

632
01:08:33,180 --> 01:08:34,180
安妮？
Annie?

633
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:38,180
安妮？
Annie?

634
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:29,290
好好睡，孩子們
Sleep tight, kids.

635
01:12:40,280 --> 01:12:41,480
保羅？
Paul?

636
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:43,780
琳達？
Lynda?

637
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:52,980
琳達？
Lynda?

638
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:05,590
安妮？
Annie?

639
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,480
安妮？
Annie?

640
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:28,980
琳達？
Lynda?

641
01:13:31,690 --> 01:13:32,690
巴伯？
Bob?

642
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:49,790
好了，安妮
All right, Annie ...

643
01:14:14,980 --> 01:14:17,180
好了，你們，玩笑結束了
All right, meatheads. The joke's over.

644
01:14:21,790 --> 01:14:22,790
快出來，安妮
Come on, Annie.

645
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:23,880
玩夠了
It's enough.

646
01:14:27,890 --> 01:14:30,790
已經不好玩了，別鬧了
This is most definitely stopping funny.
Now cut it out!

647
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:35,490
你會後悔的
You'll be sorry.

648
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,380
不要
No.

649
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,780
救命！
Help!

650
01:18:16,190 --> 01:18:18,680
快來人呀！
