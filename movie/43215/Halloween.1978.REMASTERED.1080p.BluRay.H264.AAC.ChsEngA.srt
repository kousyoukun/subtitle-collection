00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,020

10
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,820
麦克不知去那里了

11
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,020
把那东西拿开

好，一定 你保证？

00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,120
保证
Yeah.

21
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,590
你以前有没有处理过这种事？

只有在安全限度之内

我唯一担心的是他们激动的时候
The only thing that ever bothers me is their jibberish.

26
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,590
会不停的发出各种奇怪的声言
When they start raving on and on ...

27
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,290
不必担心这个
You haven't anything to worry about.

28
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,100
他己经有15年没说过话了

29
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,800
有没有要特别注意的事？
Are there any special instructions?

30
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,200
只要清楚我们是在处理什么事就好
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here.

31
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,290
不要掉以轻心
Don't underestimate it.

32
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:45,300
你不认为我们和他一样也正在期待着这件事？
Don't you think we could refer to 'it' as him?

33
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,800
你要这样说也可以
If you say so.

34
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,490
你的同情心在作祟，大夫
Your compassion's overwhelming, Doctor.

35
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,290
在带他去见法官之前，我还为他做点什么？
What do I give him, when we're taking him in front of the judge?

36
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,290
想法奇怪
Thorazin.

37
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:08,300
这样根本解决不了问题  我也是这么认为
Barely be able to sit up. That's the idea.

38
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,200
你这次很认真，是不是？
You're serious about that, aren't you?

39
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,590
是的
Yeah.

40
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,090
你是说你实在不希望放他出来  不希望
You mean, you actually never want him to get out. Never ever ...

41
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,690
绝不希望
Never.

42
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:35,190
那为什么我们还要带他去哈地郡？  因为法律这样规定
Then why we're taking up to Hardy county,if he just gonna ... Because that is the law.

43
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,990
到了
We are.

44
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,890
他们什么时候开始可以四处闲逛的？
Since when do they let them wander around?

45
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,700
到大门去 - 我们不是应该去 - 快走
Pull up to the main gate. Shouldn't we ...  Pull up?

46
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,590
停车
Stop here.

47
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,300
我们不是应该直接去医院的吗？  在这里等着
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital on ... Wait!

48
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,600
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

49
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,300
你没事吧？- 我没事 - 他跑了
You all right? - Yes, I'm ok. - He's gone. He's gone?

50
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,890
这混蛋跑了
The evil is gone!

51
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,390
我得赶紧
I gotta ...

别忘了拿锁匙去麦尔家
Don't forget to drop the key off the Myers place ...

55
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,990
好的
I won't.

56
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,990
他们会在10点半来看房子把它放在门口被子下面  我会的
They're coming by look at the house at 10:30.Be sure you leave it under the mat ... Promise.

57
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,490
劳莉
Laurie ...

58
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,800
嗨，汤米
Hi Tommy.

59
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:13,100
今晚你来吗？  同一时间，同一地点
Coming over tonight? Same time, same place.

60
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
我们能做杰克灯笼吗？  当然可以

61
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:17,300
然后看恐怖电影？  对

能做爆米花吗？  当然，当然，当然

64
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,800
你最好走快点
You better hurry up.

65
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,590
你怎么走这条路上学？  我爸爸叫我走的
How can you walk in the school this way? My dad asked me to.

66
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,790
为什么？
Why?

67
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,200
我要留锁匙
I have to drop off the key.

68
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,290
为什么？
Why?

69
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,790
因为他要卖房子
Because he's gonna sell a house.

70
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,990
为什么？
Why?

71
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,090
因为那是他的工作  哪套房子？
Because that's his job. Where?

72
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
麦尔家的房子
The Meyers house.

73
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,200
麦尔家的房子！
The Meyers house!

74
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,990
你最好不要到那里去
You're not supposed to go up there?

75
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:54,400
不，我要去
Yes, I am.

76
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,390
那是鬼屋
That's a spook house.

77
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,300
看着吧！
Just watch.

78
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,390
郎尼从来不敢进去
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.

79
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,290
郎尼说那是鬼屋
Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house.

80
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:19,190
他说那里面发生过恐怖的事  - 郎尼大概升不到六年级
He said real awful stuff happened there once. - Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.

81
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,590
我必须走了
I gotta go.

82
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,790
晚上见
I see you tonight.

83
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,700
再见！再见！
Bye.  Bye.

84
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:31,790
? 多希望能一直陪伴着你 ?
? I wish I had you all alone ... ?

85
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:35,290
? 只有我们俩人 ?
? Just the two of us ... ?

86
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:41,300
? 我会拥你入怀 ?
? I would hold you close to me ... ?

87
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,900
? 紧紧拥抱着 ?
? So close to me ... ?

88
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,190
? 只有我们俩人 ?
? Just the two ... ?

89
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,590
这不是我的责任，山姆  噢，不
I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no ...

90
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:55,790
我跟他们说过他有多危险
I told them how dangerous he was!

91
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,490
你应该设置路障 那小围壁连5岁小孩都阻止不了
You wouldn't have enough two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

92
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:02,590
但他是你的病人，大夫  如果他很强壮，你应该告诉大家
But he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody.

93
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,090
我跟每个人都说过了！
I told everybody!

94
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:05,700
但没人听我的话  那我就无能为力了
Nobody listened. - There's nothing else I can do.

95
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,990
你最好回去再打个电话
You can get back in there and get back on the telephone.

96
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,100
告诉他们昨晚什么人逃走了
Tell them exactly who walked out of here last night ...

97
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,690
告诉他们他会逃到哪里  也许只是逃走而己
And tell them exactly where he is going. - Probably going.

98
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,990
我好像在浪费口舌  山姆，他家离这里150里
I'm wasting my time. - Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles away from here.

99
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:19,890
而且，老实说，他不会开车  他昨晚开得相当好！
Now, now for God's sake, he can't drive a car! - He was doing very well last night!

100
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:22,300
一定是这里的人教他的
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

101
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:37,400
到了这里这本书就结束了
... and the book ends.

102
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:41,990
但其实撒母耳要说的是
But what Samuels is really talking about here ...

103
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:43,800
命运
is fate.

104
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,790
各位知道
You see ...

105
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:50,100
书里命运跟很多人都有关
fate caught up with several lives here.

106
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:55,090
不论科林斯采取什么样的行动
No matter what course of action Collins took ...

107
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,790
他都摆脱不了命运的束缚
he was destined to his own fate,

108
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,800
每一天都是命运的安排
his own day of reckoning with himself.

109
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,190
这
The idea ...

110
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,200
就像
is ...

111
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,200
天命
that destiny ...

112
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:14,090
是非常真实的，具体的东西  我们每个人都得处理好
is a very real, concrete thing that every person has to deal with.

113
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:20,090
对于命运，撒母耳和卡斯提的观点有什么不同？劳莉？
How does Samuels' view of fate differ from that of Costaine's? Laurie?

114
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,690
叫我吗？
M'am?

115
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,490
回答问题
Answer the question.

116
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:27,700
卡斯提写到命运某些程度上跟信仰有关
Costaine wrote that fate was somehow related only to religion

117
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,490
而撒母耳认为那只是一种自然物  就像泥土，空气，火和水一样
or where Samuels felt that ... well, fate was like a natural element, like earth, air, fire, and water.

118
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:37,190
对，撒母耳把命运人格化了
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate.

119
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:41,190
撒母耳写到，命运是不可移动的，就像一座山
In Samuels' writing, fate is a moveable like a mountain.

120
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,690
对人来说是无法改变的
It stands, where man passes a way.

121
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:46,890
命运永远不会改变
Fate never changes.

122
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,790
你，抱南瓜的 你们走开！
You, with pumpkin. Leave me alone!

123
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:18,190
他会捉到你的！捉到你的，捉到你的
He's gonna get you! - He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...

124
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,990
恶魔人来了！快走开！
The boogeyman is coming! Leave me alone!

125
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:24,290
他大概不胆小  你知不知道万圣节是什么节日？
He doesn't believe us. - Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

126
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:26,600
知道，有糖果吃
Yeah, we get candy.

127
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:34,400
恶魔人来了！恶魔人来了！恶魔人来了！
The boogey man! - The boogey man, the boogey man, the boogey ...

128
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:07,190
他己经动身了
He's on his way.

129
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:12,590
你一定要相信我，警官 他要来哈登菲尔德镇
You gotta believe me officer,he is coming to Haddonfield.

130
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,090
因为我了解他
Because I know him.

131
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,690
我是他的医生 你一定要有所准备
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

132
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,000
不信的话，那就准备棺材吧
If you don't, it's your funeral.

133
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,390
? 我们来自哈登菲尔德镇，我们很自豪 ?
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder.

134
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,790
? 听不清楚吗，那我们再大声点 ?
Can't hear now, we yell a little louder.

135
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:22,100
? 我们来自哈登菲尔德镇，我们很自豪 ?

Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed. - That's not true. Here I am.

148

What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling. - I'm never smiling again.

He can't come over tonight.

154

I thought you were babysitting tonight. The only reason she babysits is to have a place to... Oh shit ...

155

我已经有地方了
I have a place for that.

156
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,800
我忘了化学课本
I forgot my chemistry book.

Who needs books anyway? I don't need books. I always forget all of my books. I mean ...

160

169
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:39,300
我不喜欢没有幽默感的人
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.

170
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,990
今晚我们还是照旧？

还不知道 我必须把我的小弟弄走然后和和巴伯一起！
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little brother trick- or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob?

树林后面

00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:15,090
我没看到东西  那个刚才开车的，被你吼的那个
I don't see anything. - That guy who drove by so fast, when you yelled at.

189
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,700
他很敏感，是不是？
Subtle, isn't he?

190
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,590
嘿，混蛋！

他刚才站在这里

194
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:53,990
可怜的劳莉
Poor Laurie.

你又失去了一个机会

真可悲，你永远无法和男孩约会

197
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:04,600
你不应该整天帮别人看孩子  别人觉得我聪明
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much. - Guys think I'm too smart.

我认为你太怪异了 竟然在树丛后看到一个人
I don't. I think you're whacko.Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

对不起

00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:42,490
今天是万圣节 我想每个人都预期会被吓一吓
You know, it's Halloween. I guess everybody's entitled to a one good scare.

205
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,900

208
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,890
小孩子
Oh, kiddo ...

209
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,200
都是在迷信中长大的
thought you grew up from superstition.

210
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:23,790
哈罗？

00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:47,590
刚才是你吗？

我嘴里塞满了吃的 你听到吗？
 had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

219
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,590
我以为是恐吓电话
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

220
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:59,400
你听到我只是在吃东西，抱歉  我没听清楚
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie. - I've already lost it.

221
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,290
我怀疑
I Doubt that.

222
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:03,690
听好了，我妈要借车给我，我六点半来接你
Listen, my mother is letting me use her car. I'll pick you up. 6:30.

225
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:23,190
真荒谬
This is ridiculous.

他还是可以看的呀！
He can still watch.

258
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:41,190
可能他所能做的只是看看而己
That's probably all he can do.

259
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,690
这南瓜是用来做什么的？  帮汤米带的 他大概要做个杰克灯笼 这能让他忙一阵子
What's the pumkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured carving a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

我们应该弄个精彩的女童军游戏
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.

Laurie, stop caughing. What's the matter with you?

267
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:31,190
自然点，他在那里
Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie.

268
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,290
安妮，劳莉
Hi, Annie, Laurie...

269
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,200
嗨，爸爸
Hi, Dad.

270
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,690
什么事？ 什么？
What happened?  What? What happened?

271
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,890
有人硬闯进了那间仓库 可能是小孩
Somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

272
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,090
你把任何事都怪在小孩头上
You blame everything on kids.

273
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:53,690
他们拿走了一些万圣节面具，一条绳子，还有几把小刀  要不然你认为是谁干的？
What all they took was some Halloween masks, a rope and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was?

274
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,090
很难跟这位偏执的老爸沟通
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

275
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,090
你要迟到了吧？  什么？
Aren't you gonna be late ... - Huh?

276
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:03,100
我说你要迟到了  他又在吼了
I said aren't you gonna be late. - He shouts too.

277
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,090
再见！孩子们
Bye girls.

278
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,990
再见！爸爸  再见
Bye dad. - Bye.

279
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,290
警长
Sheriff.

280
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:23,390
打扰了，我是卢米斯，山姆卢米斯医生
Pardon me, I'm a Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

281
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:26,090
李布兰提  - 如果可以，我想和你说几句
Lee Brackett. - I, I'd like to have a word with you if I could.

282
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,290
好，稍等几分钟，我得拿那个  这事很重要
Ah, maybe a few minutes. I gotta take that - It's just important.

283
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,790
等十分钟  我在这里等
Ten minutes. - I'll be here.

284
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,700
你怎么了？
What's the matter with you?

285
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,700
我想他知道了，他闻得出来
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

286
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,990
他闻不出来的  他一定闻出来了
No, he didn't. - He did.

287
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,600
看到他的表情了吗？
See the look on his face?

288
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,500
他一向都是那种表情
He always looks like that.

289
00:34:01,290 --> 00:34:03,190
你明晚舞会穿什么衣服？
What  you gonna wear on dance tommorow night?

290
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:05,800
我没想到你会问这问题，劳莉
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.

291
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:15,290
要知道你可以去请别人  - 不，我不行
You know you could ask somebody. - No, I couldn't.

292
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:18,890
你当然可以，你只要过去说
Sure you could. All you have to do is go up to somebody and say ...

293
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,790
你想跳舞吗？
You wanna go to the dance?

294
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,090
你可以，我不行
You could do that, I couldn't.

295
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,300
或者你去约迪克帕西特 他会来的
Or you could ask Dick Paxter. He could go out with ya.

296
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,790
那我宁愿约班催莫
I try to get out Ben Tramor.

297
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,200
班催莫？
Ben Tramor?

298
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,600
我就知道！
I knew it!

299
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,090
你一直这样想，对吧，劳莉？
See, you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?

300
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,090
闭嘴！ 他很帅
Shut up. He is cute.

301
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,100
班催莫！
Ben Tramor.

302
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,990
好
Ok.

303
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,590
再见
Bye.

304
00:35:52,590 --> 00:36:03,300
不给糖就捣乱 不给糖就捣乱
Trick or treat, trick or treat: give me something good to eat.

305
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:18,290
嗨 - 嗨，安妮，请进  - 今天怎么样？ - 还好，你呢？
Hi. - Hi Annie, come on in. - How are you doing today? - Fine. How are you?

306
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:22,390
准备几点睡？  九点
What time are you in your bed? I'm being in bed by nine, ok.

307
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:23,690
玩得开心，亲爱的  - 要乖啊
Have a good night, dear. - Be a good girl.

308
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:25,590
再见！
Bye bye. - Here.

309
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:55,300
有人住这里吗？  - 没有，自从1963年发生那事后就没人住了
Anybody lives here? - No, not since 1963 when that happened.

310
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,290
这里的人都认为这是栋凶宅，不干净  - 我也会这么想的
Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted. - They may be right.

311
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,090
看！ 什么？
Look. What?

312
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,790
那是什么？
What is that?

313
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:21,990
一只狗
It's a dog.

314
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,490
还有热度
Still warm.

315
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,190
他一定饿极了
He got hungry.

316
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,290
他已经疯了
Could have been a skunk.

317
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:38,390
可能是
Could have.

318
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,290
正常人不会这样
A man wouldn't do that ...

319
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,690
他不是正常人
This is not a man.

320
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,590
这就是案发现场
It happened in here.

321
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,600
她当时坐在这里
She was sitting right here ...

322
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,290
他可能从这个窗户看到她
He could have seen her thru this window.

323
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:38,090
站在草坪上
Standing on the lawn ...

324
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:40,090
能看到这里
He could have seen in side.

325
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:50,590
你一定以为我是
You must think of me ...

326
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,200
一个精神不正常的医生
the very sinister doctor.

327
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,600
这是我的医师执照
I do have a permit.

328
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,200
我觉得你好像很害怕
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

329
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,090
是的
Yes.

330
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,590
是的，我
Yeah, I'm a...

331
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,390
我在15年前见他时  我当时认为他己没救
I met him ... fifteen years ago. I was told there was nothing left.

332
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:16,990
没有知觉，无法沟通  对生命和死亡没有概念
No reason ... nowhere conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death of ...

333
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,500
没有分出善恶的能力
good or evil, right or wrong.

334
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,500
我看到了这个
I met this ...

335
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,790
6岁小孩的那张
six year-old child with his ...

336
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,800
空洞，苍白，没有表情的脸
blank, pale, emotionless face, and ...

337
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:33,000
和那双来自黑暗的
the blackest eyes ...

338
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:35,490
魔鬼般的眼睛
the Devil's eyes.

339
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,890
我花了八年的时间想和他沟通
I spent eight years trying to reach him ...

340
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:42,390
之后七年把他完全拘禁 因为我知道
and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that

341
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,290
这个男孩眼睛的后面是无穷无尽的
what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply...

342
00:39:46,590 --> 00:39:48,100
邪恶
... evil.

343
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
我们怎么办？
What do we do?

344
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:52,690
他今晚曾来过
He's been here once tonight ...

345
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,590
我想他会回来
I think he'll come back.

346
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:56,700
我在这里等他
I'm gonna wait for him.

347
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:59,800
我认为应该通知广播和电视台  - 不
I still think I should notify the radio and television. - No.

348
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:05,490
这样人们会恐慌，会到处找他，如此恐怕会打草惊蛇
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner, they look for him on every house. Just tell your men to keep their ...

349
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,590
还是叫你的人保守机密，严密监视他的出没
mouth shut and their eyes open.

350
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:12,090
一小时后我再回来看看
I'll check back in an hour.

351
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,890
亚瑟现在哭的很伤心
... oh now, cried Arthur.

352
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:27,700
“让每个人都加入这场混战！”
'Let no one pass this way without a fight!'

353
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,290
“就这样”骑士大胆
'That's so,' said the knight

354
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:31,600
而又傲慢的说
in a bold and haughty manner.

355
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,390
我不喜欢那个故事  我以为亚瑟王是你最喜欢的
I don't like that story. - I thought king Arthur was your favorite.

356
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:36,900
不再是了
Not anymore.

357
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,790
为什么都藏在底下？
Why do you keep them under there?

358
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,800
妈妈不让我留着
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

359
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,090
雷射超人
'Laser Man' ...

360
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,590
中子人，我知道为什么了
'Neutron Man' ... I can understand why.

361
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,600
飞天超人
'Tarantula Man' ...

362
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,990
劳莉
Laurie ...

363
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,690
什么是恶魔人？
what's the Boogeyman?

364
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:01,600
道尔公馆
Doyle residence.

365
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:04,300
是我  嗨，安妮，你在做什么？
It's me ... - Hi Annie, what are you doing?

366
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,090
做爆米花
Making popcorn ...

367
00:41:06,390 --> 00:41:07,890
取乐
Having fun ...

368
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:10,690
你一定也是一样
Never mind, I'm sure you are.

369
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:14,190
我有一个好消息告诉你
I have big, big news for you ...

370
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:18,390
你等一下
Hold on a minute.

371
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,190
嗨 李斯特
Hi Lester...

372
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,690
我要被这只恶犬咬得稀巴烂了
I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.

373
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:34,600
林西，快把这只狗从厨房带走
Lindsey ... get this dog out of the kitchen right now.

374
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:48,700
我恨那只狗  是世界上它唯一不喜欢的人
I hate that dog ... I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

375
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,400
是什么大好消息？
So, what is this big, big news?

376
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:56,590
如果我说你会参加明晚的舞会 你信不信？
What would you say if I told you that you were going to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

377
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,200
我会说你拔错电话号码了
I would probably say you've got the wrong number.

378
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:01,490
好吧
Well ...

379
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:08,500
我刚才打电话给班催莫 告诉他你觉得他很有吸引力
I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited when I told him how attracted you were to him.

380
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,700
噢，安妮
Oh, Annie ...

381
00:42:10,290 --> 00:42:12,590
噢，不要，你不会真说了吧
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

382
00:42:12,990 --> 00:42:14,690
你怎么能这样做？
How could you do that?

383
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:19,000
你怎么打电话告诉他这些？
I mean how you just call him. What do you mean it's easy?

384
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,490
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe this.

385
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:23,400
我实在不应该把任何事都告诉你
I can't tell you anything.

386
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,900
你一定是在骗我的
Please tell me you didn't.

387
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,790
肯定是骗我的
Oh, you didn't.

388
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,190
好尴尬，我没法见他了  劳莉，恶魔人在外面
Laurie ... - I'm so embarrassed, I couldn't even face him. - Boogeyman is outside.

389
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:41,090
劳莉，就在那里  等一下
Laurie ... out there. - Hold on.

390
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,200
劳莉，恶魔人在外面，快看！
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look!

391
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,790
汤米，外面没有人
Tommy, there is nobody outside.

392
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,090
去看电视
Go watch TV.

393
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,790
刚才是汤米
It's just Tommy.

394
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:57,800
噢，安妮
Oh, please, Annie ...

395
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,000
你为什么这样做
You could do that.

396
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,600
很简单，他喜欢你，你也喜欢他  你们需要的是一点推力
Look it's simple. You like him, he likes you. All you need is a little push.

397
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:09,800
老实说，和他约会只会对你有好处
It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.

398
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,290
他妈的
Shit!

399
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,400
不不！我把衣服弄湿了  我一会再打给你
No, no, I just made a mess on myself. I gotta call you back.

400
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,690
噢，倒霉！
Oh, yuck!

401
00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:18,190
林西
Lindsey ...

402
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:20,300
我需要一件衣服
I need a robe.

403
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,790
林西
Lindsey ...

404
00:44:04,790 --> 00:44:08,690
那狗又再叫了 我这样会神经紧张的
Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.

405
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:14,000
没事了
Never mind ...

406
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,090
他一定在约会
I guess he found a hot date.

407
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:07,090
什么时候做杰克灯笼？  先把电影看完
What about the Jack-O-Lantern? - After the movie.

408
00:45:07,790 --> 00:45:11,100
那我的故事书呢？  做完杰克灯笼再说
What about the rest of my comic books? - After the Jack-O-Lantern.

409
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,100
那恶魔人呢？
What about the boogeyman?

410
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:14,890
这东西不存在
There is no such thing.

411
00:45:14,890 --> 00:45:17,200
瑞其说他今晚会来抓我
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.

412
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,090
瑞其说什么你都信吗？
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?

413
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:19,900
不是
No.

414
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,800
汤米，万圣节的夜晚，大家都想愚弄人
Tommy, Halloween night ... it's when people play tricks on each other.

415
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:27,790
相信我，瑞其只是想吓吓你
It's all make believe. I think Richie was just trying to scare you.

416
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:31,790
我看到恶魔人了 他就在外面
I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside.

417
00:45:31,790 --> 00:45:33,600
外面没有人
There was nobody outside.

418
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:35,690
有  那他长什么样子？
There was. - What did he look like?

419
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,290
长得像恶魔！
The boogyeman!

420
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,100
这么说没有任何意义
We're not getting anywhere.

421
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,690
好吧
All right.

422
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,990
恶魔人只在万圣节晚上出现，对吧？
The boogyeman can only come out on Halloween night, right?

423
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,000
对
Right.

424
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,290
那好，我整晚都在这里，这样你就不会害怕了吧
Welll, I'm here tonight. I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

425
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,400
你保证？
Promise?

426
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,900
我保证
Promise.

427
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,190
我们现在做杰克灯笼好吗？
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?

428
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,590
走
Let's go.

429
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,790
太棒了！
Hmm, terrific.

430
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,200
哈罗？
Hello?

431
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,600
谁在那里？
Who's there?

432
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,690
保罗，这又是你的恶作剧对吧？
Paul, is this one of your cheap pranks?

433
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,590
也许不是
Guess not.

434
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,300
今晚应该不会有人捉弄我
No tricks for Annie tonight.

435
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:16,690
林西
Lindsey!

436
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,590
林西，到这边来！
Lindsey, come out here!

437
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:23,590
林西，我被反锁在洗衣间了！开不了门！
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room! The door wouldn't open!

438
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:24,290
大家分头找
Spread out everybody.

439
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,690
我们要弄清楚这个东西长什么样
We gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.

440
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:29,390
我的天
Holly cat.

441
00:47:29,390 --> 00:47:31,190
嘿  对了
Hey. - Yeah.

442
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:35,490
几近完美 怎么了？
Almost perfect. What's wrong?

443
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:38,990
我们终于找到一个了 我们发现了源头
We finally got one. - We found a plain sourcer.

444
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:42,200
林西，快去接电话，是保罗打来的
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone, it's Paul.

445
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,790
林西！

446
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:48,190
林西！

447
00:48:06,090 --> 00:48:08,890
不，没有响应 - 博士，这些手指头使从哪来的？
No, no answer. - Doctor, where are those fingers from?

448
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,690
我不清楚，史考特先生  哈罗？
I don't know, Mr. Scott. Hallo?

449
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:13,590
嗨，林西，我是保罗，安妮在吗？
Hi Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

450
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:14,890
在，她在
Yes, she is.

451
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:16,290
帮我找她，好不好？
Get her for me, will ya?

452
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:18,290
她在洗衣服
She's washing her clothes.

453
00:48:18,290 --> 00:48:20,600
告诉她我来过电话，好吗？
Look, just tell her it's me, ok?

454
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,190
好

455
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:29,490
安妮！保罗来电话了

456
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:45,090
你怎么挂在那里？  我知道
You locked yourself there. - I know.

457
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,690
拉我一把，我被卡住了
Pull my foot. I'm stuck!

458
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:11,600
好了，不许跟别人提这件事
Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this.

459
00:49:30,290 --> 00:49:32,800
她刚刚被窗给卡住了，现在回来了
She got stuck in a window. She'll be right here.

460
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,790
哈罗！  嗨，安妮

Oh, hi Paul. Stuck, huh?

462

好了，不要说了，谁都会  没错，被窗卡住了
All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone. Sure ... stuck in the widow.

463
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:48,200
没错，我也看见你卡在很多地方啊
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions!

464
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,590
我爸妈出去了
My parents are gone.

465
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,690
太好了，什么时候出去的
Oh that's fabulous. When did they leave?

466
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:56,090
半小时前  这太好了
About half ago - Oh, utterly fantastic.

467
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,290
你为什么不走路过来？
So why don't you just walk over?

468
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:02,900
你来接我  现在不行，我在洗衣服
You coming pick me up. - Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash.

469
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:08,700
那你没穿  住口，混蛋，我穿衣服了，你满脑子净想那些
Oh shut up jerk. Can't, I've got a shirt on. That's all you ever think about.

470
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,400
我觉得你才满脑子想那些  胡说，我想到很多事情
I think that's all you ever think about. - That's not true, I think about lots of things.

471
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,390
为什么我们不停止纸上谈兵去实践一下呢？
Now why don't we not stand here talking about them and get down to doing them?

472
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:24,490
关好门，锁紧窗户，关掉灯
Lock your doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights.

473
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:28,290
别离开 一会你将看到奇迹  我好怕
Don't go away ... cause here is a scene ... - I'm scared.

474
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:30,790
那你为什么要坐在这么暗的地方呢？
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

475
00:50:30,790 --> 00:50:33,990
我不知道  走，去拿你的外套，我们去接保罗
I don't know. - Well, come on get your coat. We're going to pick up Paul.

476
00:50:33,990 --> 00:50:36,300
我不想去
I don't want to.

477
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,700
林西，我以为我们互相了解对方  我想呆在这看电影
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other... - I want to stay here and watch this.

478
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,390
好，我带你去汤米道尔家和他一起看电视，你不好？
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?

479
00:50:46,390 --> 00:50:49,290
好呀！  那跟我走吧
Yes. - Well, come with me.

480
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,300
快点！
Come on! Hurry up.

481
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,400
奇怪的是必须把它清空
That strange that has to short it out.

482
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,190
嗨，汤米

安妮，来这边
Annie, come in here.

486
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:41,890
现在他们得出了可怕的结论

487
00:51:44,090 --> 00:51:45,600
噢，真迷人！
Oh, fancy.

488
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,990
今晚不是属于我的
This has not been my night.

489
00:51:49,590 --> 00:51:56,290
我不小心把牛乳泼在身上，衣服正在洗，我还卡在了窗上  我希望你能打电话给班，告诉他你只是在开玩笑
I spilled butter all over. My cloths are in the wash.I got stuck in a window. I'd like you call Ben Tramer and tell him you're just fooling around.

490
00:51:56,290 --> 00:52:01,300
不行 - 行的，你可以的  不行，他和麦克戈弗雷喝酒，很晚才回来
I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, he went drinking with Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late.

491
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:04,090
你明天自己打电话给他
YOU'LL have to call him ... tomorrow.

492
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,400
况且我正要去接保罗

等一下
Wait a minute.

494
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:13,390
如果你帮我照看小孩，我会考虑明早打电话给班催莫
If you watch her, I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

496
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:19,800
我以为保罗被禁足了  没错，这小子想办法溜出来了
I thought Paul was grounded. - He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

497
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,700
我一小时后再打电话给你，好吧？  - 好

533
00:57:35,290 --> 00:57:36,590
还好
Yeah.

534
00:57:36,590 --> 00:57:42,300
除了孩子们的嘻斗之外  似乎没发生任何事
Well, nothing's going on except kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high.

535
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,590
我觉得你太小提大作了
I have the feeling you're way off on this.

536
00:57:44,590 --> 00:57:47,790
你这样想是不对的  但目前为止尚未证明我是错的
You have the wrong feeling. - You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

537
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,590
你还需要证明吗？
What more do you need?

538
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:53,600
当然，要让我整夜都藏在这树丛的后面  靠说这些荒诞的东西还不够
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.

539
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:56,090
我观察他15年了
I, I, I watched him for fifteen years ...

540
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:00,090
他坐在房间里，呆看着墙壁，不只是看着
sitting in a room, staring at a wall, not seeing the wall ...

541
00:58:00,090 --> 00:58:01,600
甚至要看穿墙壁
looking past the wall

542
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,000
如果你有这耐心
looking at ... THIS NIGHT inhumanly patient.

543
00:58:06,790 --> 00:58:09,990
等一个神密，无声的危险人物
waiting for some secret, silent alarm ...

544
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,600
等待他的出现
to trigger him off.

545
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:16,000
死亡己逼近你这个小镇，警长
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

546
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,200
你要么不理不睬，要么帮我阻止他
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.

547
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,290
你又在说怪诞的事
More fancy talk.

548
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:23,600
大夫，你了解哈登菲尔德镇吗？
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

549
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:24,690
家人
Families ...

550
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:27,890
孩子们，他们都成群结队地在街道上上下下
Children ... all lined up in rows, up and down these streets.

551
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:30,290
而你却告诉我他们可能会有危险
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

552
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:31,900
很有可能
They could be.

553
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:35,300
好，今晚我和你待在这里
All right, I'll stay with you out tonight ...

554
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,590
就当作你说的不假
just on the chance that you're right.

555
00:58:37,690 --> 00:58:39,200
就算你说的都是事实
And if you are right ...

556
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:42,090
你也要为他的逃跑负责
damn you for letting him go.

557
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,800
好，我告诉你，我们先进去，好吧？  然后我们谈几句话
So we gonna first, we'll go inside, right? Then we just talk a little.

558
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:11,790
当安妮把林西支走时，我们就上楼到左边第一个房间 了解了吗？
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we'll go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it?

559
00:59:11,790 --> 00:59:14,100
首先我撕掉你的衣服
First I rip your clothes off ...

560
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:17,800
不要撕我的胸衣，那很贵的，白痴  然后你撕掉我的衣服
Don't rip, my blouse is expensive, idiot. - Then you rip my clothes off...

561
00:59:17,800 --> 00:59:20,700
然后我们把林西的衣服也撕掉  耶！我觉得我全明白了！
then we rip Lyndsey's cloth off. Yeah, I think I got it.

562
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:21,700
你全明白了
Totally.

563
00:59:41,590 --> 00:59:44,290
巴伯，放我下来
Bob ... put me down.

564
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:47,190
放我下来，别闹了
Put me down. This is totally silly.

565
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,390
放我下来
Put me down.

566
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,790
怎么这么暗  是呀！
Hey, it's totally dark. - Yeah.

567
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:55,900
安妮！
Annie!

568
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:59,590
安妮，我们来了  他们去哪了？
Annie, we're here! - I wonder where they went.

569
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:02,790
安妮可能带林西出去了
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.

570
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,700
找找看有没有留字条
Hey, let's look for a note.

571
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,200
别找了
Let's not.

572
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:50,300
他会抓到你的
He's gonna get you ...

573
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:54,290
不，他抓不到  嘿，没有谁要抓任何人 不要吓人
No, he's not. - Hey, nobody's getting anybody. Stop scaring each other.

574
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:12,890
今夜每个人都各得其所
Everybody's having good time tonight.

575
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:15,390
好，小鬼，下来要玩什么？
All right, guys, what's next?

576
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:19,400
我们再多做点爆米花吧  不，已经够多了 要不一起把电影看完吧？
Let's make more popcorn. - No, we had enough. Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

577
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,600
好
Yeah.

578
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,790
好了， 把它放回去
All right, put it back on.

579
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,490
道尔公馆
Doyle house.

580
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,600
嗨，劳莉，怎么样了
Hi Laurie ... what's up?

581
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:43,800
我今晚才刚刚坐下来
I'm just setting down for the first time tonight.

582
01:01:44,690 --> 01:01:46,290
嘿，安妮在你那里吗？
Hey ... is Annie around?

583
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:47,990
不在，她现在应该回去了
No, I thought she'd be home by now.

584
01:01:47,990 --> 01:01:51,390
她说要去接保罗  她根本不在这里
She went to pick up Paul. - Well, she's totally not here.

585
01:01:53,190 --> 01:01:55,090
她大概去别地方了
She's probably stopped off some place.

586
01:01:55,090 --> 01:01:59,090
她回去时让她给我打个电话  林西在我这边，我要知道何时叫她去睡觉
Have her call me when she gets home. I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know what time to put her to bed.

587
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:02,690
好，回见  祝你愉快
Okay. Later. - Have a good time.

588
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,800
我们一定会很愉快的
We definetely will.

589
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:06,890
再见！
Bye.

590
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:13,800
林西晚上不会回来了  那太好了
Lindsey is gone for the night. - Hey, now that's wonderful.

591
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:59,090
妈的！又来了
Oh, shit! Not again.

592
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:01,090
真受不了，这电话老是响个不停
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

593
01:03:01,700 --> 01:03:04,600
噢，我没法让你保持兴奋，对吗？  还是快接这破电话吧！
Oh, I can't keep you interested, huh? - Just answer that damn phone.

594
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:07,590
不能接 要是华莱士夫妇打回来的怎么办？
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?

595
01:03:07,590 --> 01:03:09,290
接了安妮可就麻烦了
We'd get Annie in trouble now.

596
01:03:13,690 --> 01:03:15,300
我们把话筒拿起来
Just take it off the hook.

597
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:52,000
太棒了！
Fantastic.

598
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:57,190
太美了  是呀！
Totally. - Yeah.

599
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:10,300
满足了吗？
Is that all you can say?

600
01:04:10,300 --> 01:04:11,090
是的
Yeah.

601
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:17,100
去拿瓶酒给我  应该你去拿给我
Go get me a beer. - I thought you were gonna get me one.

602
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:18,190
快去
Yeaah.

603
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,290
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

604
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:24,490
不要把衣服穿上
Don't get dressed.

605
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,300
安妮？
Annie?

606
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:23,590
保罗？
Paul?

607
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,690
林西你这王八蛋
Lynda, you asshole!

608
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:35,290
好了！琳达
Ok, Lynda.

609
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:36,390
出来吧！
Come on out.

610
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:40,900
我的酒呢？
Well, did you get my beer?

611
01:06:48,090 --> 01:06:50,290
可爱，巴伯，你很可爱
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

612
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,190
看到你喜欢的东西了吗？
See anything you like?

613
01:07:12,190 --> 01:07:14,600
怎么了？巴伯，你能脱掉那套衣服吗？
What's the matter? Can I get your ghost, Bob?

614
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,100
好了，别闹了，我的啤酒呢？
All right, all right. Come on, where is my beer?

615
01:07:31,390 --> 01:07:33,090
你回答我好不好？
Ok, ain't answer me?

616
01:07:37,300 --> 01:07:38,800
好，你别回答了
Ok, don't answer me?

617
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,490
你真奇怪！我要打电话给劳莉
Oh, you're weird! - I'm gonna call Laurie.

618
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:46,100
我要打电话给劳莉  我要知道保罗和安妮去哪里了
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie. I wanna know where Annie and Paul are.

619
01:07:46,100 --> 01:07:47,590
这就不好玩了哦
This is going nowhere.

620
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:53,200
终于打来了
Finally.

621
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:00,190
哈罗！
Hello.

622
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,400
哈罗？
Hello?

623
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:11,700
好了，安妮，上次是在吃东西  这次变成尖叫了？
All right, Annie. First I get your famous chewing, now I get your famous squealing?

624
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,390
安妮，你没事吧？
Annie, you all right?

625
01:08:27,490 --> 01:08:29,300
你是不是又在开玩笑？
Are you fooling around again?

626
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,590
如果又在开玩笑，我会杀了你
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

627
01:08:33,490 --> 01:08:34,490
安妮？
Annie?

628
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,490
安妮？

01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:41,790
保罗？

631
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:44,090

637
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:50,100
好了，安妮
All right, Annie ...

638
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:17,490
好了，你们，玩笑结束了
All right, meatheads. The joke's over.

639
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:23,100
快出来，安妮
Come on, Annie.

640
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,190
玩够了
It's enough.

641
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:31,100
已经不好玩了，别闹了
This is most definitely stopping funny. Now cut it out!

642
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:35,800
你会后悔的
You'll be sorry.

643
01:17:47,690 --> 01:17:48,690
不要
No.

644
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,090
