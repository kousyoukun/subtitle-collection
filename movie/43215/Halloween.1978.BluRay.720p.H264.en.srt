1
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:12,038
Black cats and goblins
and broomsticks and ghosts.

2
00:02:12,247 --> 00:02:15,625
Pumpkins of witches are there to roast.

3
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:19,129
You may think, they scare me.
You're probably right.

4
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:22,132
Black cats and goblins
on Halloween night.

5
00:02:22,132 --> 00:02:23,842
Trick-or-treat!!!

6
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:48,033
My parents won't be home until ten.
- Are you sure?

7
00:02:57,751 --> 00:02:59,252
We're all alone, aren't we?

8
00:03:00,128 --> 00:03:02,047
Michael's around someplace ...

9
00:03:03,423 --> 00:03:05,217
Take off that thing.

10
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,638
Let's go upstairs.
- Ok.

11
00:04:32,053 --> 00:04:33,722
Look, Judith, it's very late.

12
00:04:33,722 --> 00:04:35,056
I gotta go.

13
00:04:35,056 --> 00:04:36,641
Will you call me tomorrow?

14
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,352
Yeah, sure.
- Promise?

15
00:04:39,352 --> 00:04:40,353
Yeah.

16
00:05:47,921 --> 00:05:49,422
Michael?

17
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,755
Michael?

18
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:47,541
Ever done anything like this before?

19
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,627
Only minimum security.

20
00:07:51,044 --> 00:07:52,420
I see.

21
00:07:54,548 --> 00:07:57,926
The driveway's a few hundred yards
up on the right.

22
00:07:59,845 --> 00:08:02,848
The only thing that ever bothers me
is their jibberish.

23
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:06,518
When they start raving on and on ...

24
00:08:06,726 --> 00:08:09,229
You haven't anything to worry about.

25
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:13,024
He hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.

26
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:15,735
Are there any special instructions?

27
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,156
Just try to understand
what we're dealing with here.

28
00:08:19,823 --> 00:08:21,241
Don't underestimate it.

29
00:08:21,241 --> 00:08:24,244
Don't you think
we could refer to 'it' as him?

30
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,746
If you say so.

31
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:30,417
Your compassion's
overwhelming, Doctor.

32
00:08:37,924 --> 00:08:40,218
What do I give him, when we're taking him
in front of the judge?

33
00:08:41,052 --> 00:08:42,220
Thorazin.

34
00:08:44,055 --> 00:08:47,225
Barely be able to sit up.
- That's the idea.

35
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,154
You're serious about that, aren't you?

36
00:08:59,654 --> 00:09:00,530
Yeah.

37
00:09:03,033 --> 00:09:07,037
You mean, you actually never want him to get out.
- Never ever ...

38
00:09:07,746 --> 00:09:08,622
Never.

39
00:09:09,539 --> 00:09:14,127
Then why we're taking up to Hardy county,
if he just gonna ... - Because that is the law.

40
00:09:15,754 --> 00:09:16,922
We are.

41
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,847
Since when do they let them wander around?

42
00:09:28,016 --> 00:09:30,644
Pull up to the main gate.
- Shouldn't we ... - Pull up?

43
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,530
Stop here.

44
00:09:45,242 --> 00:09:48,245
Shouldn't we go on up to the hospital on ...
- Wait!

45
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,555
Are you all right?

46
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:52,225
You all right?
- Yes, I'm ok. - He's gone. He's gone?

47
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:53,852
The evil is gone!

48
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:00,317
I gotta ...

49
00:11:59,126 --> 00:12:02,045
Don't forget to drop the key off
the Myers place ...

50
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:03,922
I won't.

51
00:12:03,922 --> 00:12:08,927
They're coming by look at the house at 10:30.
Be sure you leave it under the mat ... - Promise.

52
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:43,420
Laurie ...

53
00:12:45,255 --> 00:12:46,756
Hi Tommy.

54
00:12:49,217 --> 00:12:52,053
Coming over tonight?
- Same time, same place.

55
00:12:52,053 --> 00:12:54,055
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
- Sure.

56
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:56,224
And watch the monster movies?
- Sure.

57
00:12:56,224 --> 00:12:57,517
Will you read to me?

58
00:12:57,517 --> 00:13:00,645
Can we make popcorn?
- Sure, sure, sure.

59
00:13:03,356 --> 00:13:04,733
You better hurry up.

60
00:13:06,234 --> 00:13:09,529
How can you walk in the school this way?
- My dad asked me to.

61
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:10,739
Why?

62
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:12,157
I have to drop off the key.

63
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:13,241
Why?

64
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,743
Because he's gonna sell a house.

65
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:15,952
Why?

66
00:13:15,952 --> 00:13:18,038
Because that's his job.
- Where?

67
00:13:18,455 --> 00:13:19,456
The Meyers house.

68
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,124
The Meyers house!

69
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,927
You're not supposed to go up there?

70
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:33,345
Yes, I am.

71
00:13:34,638 --> 00:13:36,348
That's a spook house.

72
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,225
Just watch.

73
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,320
Lonnie Elam said never to go up there.

74
00:13:50,821 --> 00:13:53,240
Lonnie Elam said that's a haunted house.

75
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:58,120
He said real awful stuff happened there once.
- Lonnie Elam probably won't get out of the 6th grade.

76
00:13:58,453 --> 00:13:59,538
I gotta go.

77
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:00,747
I see you tonight.

78
00:14:01,123 --> 00:14:02,624
Bye.
- Bye.

79
00:14:06,128 --> 00:14:10,715
# I wish I had you all alone ... #

80
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:14,219
# Just the two of us ... #

81
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:20,225
# I would hold you close to me ... #

82
00:14:21,017 --> 00:14:23,854
# So close to me ... #

83
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:29,151
# Just the two ... #

84
00:14:31,027 --> 00:14:33,530
I'm not responsible, Sam. - Oh, no ...

85
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,739
I told them how dangerous he was!

86
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:38,452
You wouldn't have enough two roadblocks and
an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!

87
00:14:38,452 --> 00:14:41,538
But he was your patient, Doctor. If precautions
weren't strong enough, you should have told somebody.

88
00:14:41,538 --> 00:14:43,039
I told everybody!

89
00:14:43,039 --> 00:14:44,624
Nobody listened.
- There's nothing else I can do.

90
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,918
You can get back in there
and get back on the telephone.

91
00:14:46,918 --> 00:14:49,045
Tell them exactly
who walked out of here last night ...

92
00:14:49,045 --> 00:14:51,631
And tell them exactly where he is going.
- Probably going.

93
00:14:51,631 --> 00:14:54,926
I'm wasting my time. - Sam, Haddonfield is
a hundred and fifty miles away from here.

94
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:58,847
Now, now for God's sake, he can't drive a car!
- He was doing very well last night!

95
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:01,224
Maybe someone around here gave him lessons.

96
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:08,732
Doctor Chance, plese come to point C ...

97
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:13,028
Doctor Chance, point C please.

98
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:16,323
... and the book ends.

99
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:20,952
But what Samuels is really talking about here ...

100
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:22,746
is fate.

101
00:15:23,455 --> 00:15:24,748
You see ...

102
00:15:24,748 --> 00:15:29,044
fate caught up with several lives here.

103
00:15:29,628 --> 00:15:34,049
No matter what course of action Collins took ...

104
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:37,719
he was destined to his own fate,

105
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:41,723
his own day of reckoning with himself.

106
00:15:42,349 --> 00:15:44,142
The idea ...

107
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:45,143
is ...

108
00:15:45,352 --> 00:15:47,145
that destiny ...

109
00:15:47,145 --> 00:15:53,026
is a very real, concrete thing
that every person has to deal with.

110
00:15:53,318 --> 00:15:59,032
How does Samuels' view of fate
differ from that of Costaine's? Laurie?

111
00:15:59,032 --> 00:15:59,616
M'am?

112
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,451
Answer the question.

113
00:16:02,619 --> 00:16:06,623
Costaine wrote that fate--
was somehow related only to religion

114
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:12,420
or where Samuels felt that ... well, fate was like
a natural element, like earth, air, fire, and water.

115
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,133
That's right, Samuels definitely personified fate.

116
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:20,137
In Samuels' writing, fate is a moveable like a mountain.

117
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:23,640
It stands, where man passes a way.

118
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,851
Fate never changes.

119
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:50,750
You, with pumpkin.
- Leave me alone!

120
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:57,132
He's gonna get you!
- He's gonna get you, he's gonna get you...

121
00:16:57,132 --> 00:16:59,926
The boogeyman is coming!
- Leave me alone!

122
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:03,221
He doesn't believe us.
- Don't you know what happens on Halloween?

123
00:17:03,221 --> 00:17:05,557
Yeah, we get candy.

124
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:13,356
The boogey man!
- The boogey man, the boogey man, the boogey ...

125
00:18:44,739 --> 00:18:46,158
He's on his way.

126
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:51,538
You gotta believe me officer,
he is coming to Haddonfield.

127
00:18:52,747 --> 00:18:55,041
Because I know him.

128
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,628
I'm his doctor. You must be ready for him.

129
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,923
If you don't, it's your funeral.

130
00:19:54,142 --> 00:19:56,353
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder.

131
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:58,730
Can't hear now, we yell a little louder.

132
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:01,024
We're from Haddonfield, couldn't be prouder!

133
00:20:01,024 --> 00:20:02,526
Can't hear now ... continue
- Oh, look at you.

134
00:20:02,526 --> 00:20:06,029
Get off the books you have.
You neeed a shopping cart to get home.

135
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:11,743
Heeey Haddonfield!
- Yeah, one for me.

136
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,540
You know it's totally insane!
We have three new cheers to learn in the morning,

137
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:19,626
the game in the afternoon, I have to get my hair
done at five and the dance is at eight.

138
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:22,045
I'll be totally wiped out!

139
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:24,548
I don't think get enough to do tommorow.
- Totally!

140
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,225
As usual, I have nothing to do.
- It's your own fault and I don't feel bit sorry for you.

141
00:20:36,643 --> 00:20:38,854
Hey, Lynda, Laurie!

142
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:40,856
Why didn't you wait for me?

143
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:41,648
We did.

144
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:46,027
Fifteen minutes. You totally never showed.
- That's not true. Here I am.

145
00:20:48,822 --> 00:20:52,617
What's wrong, Annie? You're not smiling.
- I'm never smiling again.

146
00:20:52,617 --> 00:20:58,039
Paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell ...
- Exploring uncharted territory?- It's been totally charted.

147
00:20:58,039 --> 00:20:59,249
We just talked.

148
00:20:59,249 --> 00:21:00,417
Sure, sure.

149
00:21:00,417 --> 00:21:05,255
Old jerko got caught throwing eggs
and soaping windows. His parents grounded him.

150
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:07,048
He can't come over tonight.

151
00:21:07,048 --> 00:21:11,052
I thought you were babysitting tonight. - The only reason
she babysits is to have a place to... - Oh shit ...

152
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,222
I have a place for that.

153
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:16,725
I forgot my chemistry book.

154
00:21:17,225 --> 00:21:21,730
So, who cares? I always forget my chemistry book
and my math book and my english book and my ...

155
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,523
and let's see my French book and ...

156
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:28,028
Who needs books anyway? I don't need books.
I always forget all of my books. I mean ...

157
00:21:28,028 --> 00:21:30,322
it doesn't really matter if I you got that books or not.

158
00:21:31,948 --> 00:21:33,742
Hey, isn't that the van Graham?

159
00:21:35,619 --> 00:21:36,953
I don't think so.

160
00:21:37,621 --> 00:21:39,247
I think he's cute.

161
00:21:43,543 --> 00:21:45,045
Hey, jerk ...

162
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:47,756
Speed kills!

163
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,851
Gosh ... Can't he take a joke?

164
00:22:07,651 --> 00:22:10,320
You know, Annie, some day
you gonna get us all into deep trouble.

165
00:22:13,323 --> 00:22:14,741
Totally.

166
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:18,245
I hate a guy with a car and no sense of humor.

167
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:22,916
Well, are we still on for tonight?

168
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:25,919
I wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, Lynda.

169
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,629
Oh come on, Annie ...

170
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:30,048
Bob and I've been planning on it all week.

171
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,550
All right.

172
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:33,927
The Wallaces leave at seven.

173
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:35,220
I'm babysitting the Doyles.

174
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,225
It's only three houses down. We can keep each other
company. - Ohh, terrific ... I've got three choices.

175
00:22:40,225 --> 00:22:44,521
Watch the kid sleep, listen to Lynda
screw around or talk to you.

176
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:50,318
We're so ma ...

177
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:51,653
Here.

178
00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:23,351
What time at night?

179
00:23:23,351 --> 00:23:27,647
I don't know yet. I have to get out of taking my little
brother trick- or-treating. - Saving the treats for Bob?

180
00:23:27,647 --> 00:23:28,857
Fun-ny.

181
00:23:28,857 --> 00:23:31,026
See you.
- Bye. - Bye.

182
00:23:44,247 --> 00:23:45,540
Annie, look.

183
00:23:46,041 --> 00:23:47,250
Look where?

184
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,627
Behind the bush.

185
00:23:50,253 --> 00:23:54,049
I don't see anything.
- That guy who drove by so fast, when you yelled at.

186
00:23:54,716 --> 00:23:56,635
Subtle, isn't he?

187
00:24:03,725 --> 00:24:05,519
Hey, creep!

188
00:24:08,355 --> 00:24:11,817
Laurie, dear, he wants to talk to you.

189
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:15,153
He wants to take you out tonight.

190
00:24:29,751 --> 00:24:31,253
He was standing right there.

191
00:24:31,253 --> 00:24:32,921
Poor Laurie.

192
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:35,257
Scared another one away.

193
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:38,426
It's tragic. You never go out.

194
00:24:38,426 --> 00:24:43,515
You must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting
so much. - Guys think I'm too smart.

195
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:47,519
I don't. I think you're whacko.
Now you're seeing men behind bushes.

196
00:24:50,147 --> 00:24:52,524
Well, home sweet home.

197
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,651
See you later.

198
00:24:55,152 --> 00:24:57,028
Bye.
- Bye.

199
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:16,047
Excuse me, Laurie. - Oh, Mr. Brackett,
I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett. - Oh, I didn't mean to scary ya.

200
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:17,215
I'm sorry.

201
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:21,428
You know, it's Halloween.
I guess everybody's entitled to a one good scare.

202
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:22,846
Yes, sir.

203
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:24,347
Nice evening, sir.

204
00:26:02,928 --> 00:26:05,555
Trick -o - treat, Trick -o - treat.

205
00:26:09,226 --> 00:26:10,852
Oh, kiddo ...

206
00:26:10,852 --> 00:26:13,146
thought you grew up from superstition.

207
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,737
Hello?

208
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:07,534
Hello?

209
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:11,955
Who is this?

210
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:22,924
Hello?

211
00:27:22,924 --> 00:27:24,426
Why did you hang up on me?

212
00:27:24,426 --> 00:27:25,218
Annie?

213
00:27:25,218 --> 00:27:26,553
Was that you?

214
00:27:26,553 --> 00:27:29,639
Of course.
- Why didn't you say anything? You scared me to death.

215
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:31,641
I had my mouth full. Couldn't you hear me?

216
00:27:31,641 --> 00:27:33,518
I thought it was an obscene phone call.

217
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:38,356
Now you hear obscene chewing. You're losing it, Laurie.
- I've already lost it.

218
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:39,232
I Doubt that.

219
00:27:39,232 --> 00:27:42,652
Listen, my mother is letting me use her car.
I'll pick you up. 6:30.

220
00:27:42,652 --> 00:27:45,030
Ok, bye.
-Bye.

221
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,127
Just calm down.

222
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,130
This is ridiculous.

223
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:19,458
Hurry up.

224
00:29:29,217 --> 00:29:30,635
Just have time.

225
00:29:44,024 --> 00:29:46,318
Judith Myers. Myers.

226
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,738
Row 18 ... plot 20.

227
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:54,534
Hey, you know. You know,
every town has something like this happen.

228
00:29:55,535 --> 00:29:57,120
I remember over in Russellville.

229
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,540
Old Charly Bowles. About fifteen years ago.

230
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:03,418
One night he, he finished dinner ...

231
00:30:03,752 --> 00:30:06,546
And he excused himself from the table ...

232
00:30:07,047 --> 00:30:09,424
And he went out to the garage ...

233
00:30:09,925 --> 00:30:12,219
He got himself a hack saw ...

234
00:30:13,136 --> 00:30:15,222
And then he went back into the house ...

235
00:30:15,222 --> 00:30:18,141
And he kissed his wife and two children goodbye ...

236
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:21,019
And then he proceeded ...
- Where are we?

237
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:24,231
It's right over here.

238
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:28,026
Myers, Judith Myers. I remember her.

239
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,319
Couldn't believe.

240
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:31,029
Such a young boy.

241
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:33,532
Well, you lost?

242
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,243
Why do they do it?

243
00:30:36,243 --> 00:30:38,036
Goddamn kids.

244
00:30:39,955 --> 00:30:41,957
They'll do anything for Halloweens.

245
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:46,044
It was grave, hers.
- Oh, I know that.

246
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:48,421
18, 19 ...

247
00:30:51,424 --> 00:30:52,717
Judith Myers.

248
00:30:55,846 --> 00:30:57,639
He came home.

249
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,020
You still spooked?

250
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,647
I wasn't spooked.

251
00:31:06,523 --> 00:31:08,525
Lies.
- I wasn't.

252
00:31:08,525 --> 00:31:12,237
Saw somebody standing in Mr. Riddle's back yard.
- Probably Mr. Riddle.

253
00:31:12,237 --> 00:31:16,950
He was watching me.
- Mr. Riddle was watching you? Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

254
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,243
He can still watch.

255
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:20,120
That's probably all he can do.

256
00:31:21,121 --> 00:31:26,626
What's the pumkin for? - I brought it for Tommy. I figured
carving a Jack-O-Lantern would keep him occupied.

257
00:31:26,626 --> 00:31:29,546
I always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
-

258
00:31:29,546 --> 00:31:33,216
Thanks. - And for that matter,
I might as well be a girl scout myself tonight.

259
00:31:33,216 --> 00:31:36,720
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Doctor Demensia.

260
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,641
Six straight hours of horror movies.
Little Lindsey Wallace won't know what hit her.

261
00:31:51,318 --> 00:31:52,527
My dad!

262
00:31:52,527 --> 00:31:53,820
Get rid of this.

263
00:32:02,537 --> 00:32:05,540
Laurie, stop caughing. What's the matter with you?

264
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:10,128
Just be natural. There he is. Just be natural, Laurie.

265
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,218
Hi, Annie, Laurie...

266
00:32:16,927 --> 00:32:18,136
Hi, Dad.

267
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:21,640
What happened?
- What? What happened?

268
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,851
Somebody broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.

269
00:32:24,851 --> 00:32:27,020
You blame everything on kids.

270
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:32,651
What all they took was some Halloween masks, a rope
and a couple of knives. Who do you think it was?

271
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:35,028
It's hard growing up with a cynical father.

272
00:32:36,238 --> 00:32:38,031
Aren't you gonna be late ...
- Huh?

273
00:32:38,031 --> 00:32:42,035
I said aren't you gonna be late.
- He shouts too.

274
00:32:45,956 --> 00:32:47,040
Bye girls.

275
00:32:47,249 --> 00:32:48,917
Bye dad.
- Bye.

276
00:32:57,217 --> 00:32:58,218
Sheriff.

277
00:32:59,427 --> 00:33:02,347
Pardon me, I'm a Loomis. Dr. Sam Loomis.

278
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:05,016
Lee Brackett.
- I, I'd like to have a word with you if I could.

279
00:33:05,016 --> 00:33:08,228
Ah, maybe a few minutes. I gotta take that
- It's just important.

280
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,730
Ten minutes.
- I'll be here.

281
00:33:26,621 --> 00:33:28,623
What's the matter with you?

282
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:30,625
I think he knew. I'm sure he could smell it.

283
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,919
No, he didn't.
- He did.

284
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,546
See the look on his face?

285
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:37,424
He always looks like that.

286
00:33:40,218 --> 00:33:42,137
What  you gonna wear on dance tommorow night?

287
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:44,723
I didn't know you thought about things like that, Laurie.

288
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:54,232
You know you could ask somebody.
- No, I couldn't.

289
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:57,819
Sure you could.
All you have to do is go up to somebody and say ...

290
00:33:57,819 --> 00:33:59,738
You wanna go to the dance?

291
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,032
You could do that, I couldn't.

292
00:34:03,033 --> 00:34:06,244
Or you could ask Dick Paxter.
He could go out with ya.

293
00:34:07,037 --> 00:34:08,747
I try to get out Ben Tramor.

294
00:34:09,956 --> 00:34:12,125
Ben Tramor?

295
00:34:12,751 --> 00:34:14,544
I knew it!

296
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:19,049
See, you do think about things like that, huh, Laurie?

297
00:34:19,633 --> 00:34:22,052
Shut up.
- He is cute.

298
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,054
Ben Tramor.

299
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:57,921
Ok.

300
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,548
Bye.

301
00:35:31,538 --> 00:35:42,257
Trick or treat, trick or treat:
give me something good to eat.

302
00:35:53,226 --> 00:35:57,230
Hi. - Hi Annie, come on in.
- How are you doing today? - Fine. How are you?

303
00:35:57,647 --> 00:36:01,318
What time are you in your bed?
- I'm being in bed by nine, ok.

304
00:36:01,318 --> 00:36:02,652
Have a good night, dear.
- Be a good girl.

305
00:36:02,652 --> 00:36:04,529
Bye bye.
- Here.

306
00:36:30,639 --> 00:36:34,226
Anybody lives here?
- No, not since 1963 when that happened.

307
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:38,230
Every kid in Haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
- They may be right.

308
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:58,041
Look.
- What?

309
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,751
What is that?

310
00:37:00,043 --> 00:37:00,919
It's a dog.

311
00:37:08,135 --> 00:37:09,427
Still warm.

312
00:37:10,637 --> 00:37:12,139
He got hungry.

313
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:16,226
Could have been a skunk.

314
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:17,352
Could have.

315
00:37:18,728 --> 00:37:20,230
A man wouldn't do that ...

316
00:37:21,148 --> 00:37:22,649
This is not a man.

317
00:37:59,019 --> 00:38:00,520
It happened in here.

318
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:03,523
She was sitting right here ...

319
00:38:11,531 --> 00:38:13,241
He could have seen her thru this window.

320
00:38:15,452 --> 00:38:17,037
Standing on the lawn ...

321
00:38:17,037 --> 00:38:18,538
He could have seen in side.

322
00:38:28,048 --> 00:38:29,549
You must think of me ...

323
00:38:29,549 --> 00:38:31,134
the very sinister doctor.

324
00:38:34,054 --> 00:38:35,555
I do have a permit.

325
00:38:37,641 --> 00:38:40,143
Seems to me you're just plain scared.

326
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,019
Yes.

327
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,521
Yeah, I'm a...

328
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:48,318
I met him ... fifteen years ago.
I was told there was nothing left.

329
00:38:48,318 --> 00:38:55,951
No reason ... nowhere conscience, no understanding
in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death of ...

330
00:38:56,743 --> 00:38:59,454
good or evil, right or wrong.

331
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:01,456
I met this ...

332
00:39:01,915 --> 00:39:04,751
six year-old child with his ...

333
00:39:04,751 --> 00:39:08,755
blank, pale, emotionless face, and ...

334
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,925
the blackest eyes ...

335
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:14,427
the Devil's eyes.

336
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:17,848
I spent eight years trying to reach him ...

337
00:39:17,848 --> 00:39:21,351
and then another seven trying to keep him locked up,
because I realized that

338
00:39:21,351 --> 00:39:25,230
what was living behind that boy's eyes
was purely and simply...

339
00:39:25,522 --> 00:39:27,023
... evil.

340
00:39:27,524 --> 00:39:28,525
What do we do?

341
00:39:29,526 --> 00:39:31,653
He's been here once tonight ...

342
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,530
I think he'll come back.

343
00:39:33,822 --> 00:39:35,657
I'm gonna wait for him.

344
00:39:35,657 --> 00:39:38,743
I still think I should notify the radio and television.
- No.

345
00:39:38,743 --> 00:39:44,416
If you do that, they'll see him on every street corner, they
look for him on every house. Just tell your men to keep their ...

346
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,543
mouth shut and their eyes open.

347
00:39:49,129 --> 00:39:51,047
I'll check back in an hour.

348
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:03,852
... oh now, cried Arthur.

349
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:06,646
'Let no one pass this way without a fight!'

350
00:40:06,646 --> 00:40:08,231
'That's so,' said the knight

351
00:40:08,231 --> 00:40:10,525
in a bold and haughty manner.

352
00:40:10,525 --> 00:40:14,321
I don't like that story.
- I thought king Arthur was your favorite.

353
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:15,822
Not anymore.

354
00:40:18,241 --> 00:40:19,743
Why do you keep them under there?

355
00:40:19,743 --> 00:40:21,745
Mom doesn't like me to have them.

356
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,039
'Laser Man' ...

357
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:27,542
'Neutron Man' ... I can understand why.

358
00:40:27,918 --> 00:40:29,544
'Tarantula Man' ...

359
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:30,921
Laurie ...

360
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,631
what's the Boogeyman?

361
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:40,555
Doyle residence.

362
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:43,225
It's me ...
- Hi Annie, what are you doing?

363
00:40:43,225 --> 00:40:45,018
Making popcorn ...

364
00:40:45,352 --> 00:40:46,853
Having fun ...

365
00:40:46,853 --> 00:40:49,648
Never mind, I'm sure you are.

366
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:53,151
I have big, big news for you ...

367
00:40:56,238 --> 00:40:57,322
Hold on a minute.

368
00:40:58,949 --> 00:41:00,117
Hi Lester...

369
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:03,620
I'm about to be ripped apart by the family dog.

370
00:41:09,251 --> 00:41:13,547
Lindsey ... get this dog out of the kitchen right now.

371
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:27,644
I hate that dog ...
I'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.

372
00:41:28,145 --> 00:41:30,355
So, what is this big, big news?

373
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:35,527
What would you say if I told you that you were going
to the Homecoming Dance tomorrow night?

374
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,155
I would probably say you've got the wrong number.

375
00:41:38,822 --> 00:41:40,449
Well ...

376
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:47,456
I just talked with Ben Tramer and he got real excited
when I told him how attracted you were to him.

377
00:41:47,456 --> 00:41:48,623
Oh, Annie ...

378
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:51,543
Oh, you didn't. Please tell me you didn't.

379
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:53,628
How could you do that?

380
00:41:53,628 --> 00:41:57,924
I mean how you just call him.
What do you mean it's easy?

381
00:41:58,633 --> 00:42:00,427
I can't believe this.

382
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,345
I can't tell you anything.

383
00:42:09,519 --> 00:42:10,854
Please tell me you didn't.

384
00:42:11,146 --> 00:42:12,731
Oh, you didn't.

385
00:42:13,648 --> 00:42:17,152
Laurie ... - I'm so embarrassed, I couldn't even face him.
- Boogeyman is outside.

386
00:42:17,652 --> 00:42:20,030
Laurie ... out there.
- Hold on.

387
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,115
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside. Look!

388
00:42:28,246 --> 00:42:29,748
Tommy, there is nobody outside.

389
00:42:30,624 --> 00:42:32,042
Go watch TV.

390
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,752
It's just Tommy.

391
00:42:35,545 --> 00:42:36,755
Oh, please, Annie ...

392
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:38,924
You could do that.

393
00:42:39,633 --> 00:42:44,554
Look it's simple. You like him, he likes you.
All you need is a little push.

394
00:42:45,722 --> 00:42:48,725
It won't hurt you to go out with him, for God's sake.

395
00:42:49,226 --> 00:42:50,227
Shit!

396
00:42:51,019 --> 00:42:54,356
No, no, I just made a mess on myself.
I gotta call you back.

397
00:42:54,356 --> 00:42:55,649
Oh, yuck!

398
00:42:55,649 --> 00:42:57,150
Lindsey ...

399
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,236
I need a robe.

400
00:43:42,654 --> 00:43:43,738
Lindsey ...

401
00:43:43,738 --> 00:43:47,617
Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.

402
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:52,956
Never mind ...

403
00:43:53,248 --> 00:43:55,041
I guess he found a hot date.

404
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:46,051
What about the Jack-O-Lantern?
- After the movie.

405
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:50,055
What about the rest of my comic books?
- After the Jack-O-Lantern.

406
00:44:50,222 --> 00:44:52,015
What about the boogeyman?

407
00:44:52,349 --> 00:44:53,850
There is no such thing.

408
00:44:53,850 --> 00:44:56,144
Richie said he was coming after me tonight.

409
00:44:56,144 --> 00:44:58,021
Do you believe everything that Richie tells you?

410
00:44:58,021 --> 00:44:58,855
No.

411
00:45:00,023 --> 00:45:03,735
Tommy, Halloween night ...
it's when people play tricks on each other.

412
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:06,738
It's all make believe.
I think Richie was just trying to scare you.

413
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:10,742
I saw the boogeyman. I saw him outside.

414
00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:12,536
There was nobody outside.

415
00:45:12,536 --> 00:45:14,621
There was.
- What did he look like?

416
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:17,249
The boogyeman!

417
00:45:18,416 --> 00:45:20,043
We're not getting anywhere.

418
00:45:20,752 --> 00:45:21,628
All right.

419
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:23,922
The boogyeman can only come out
on Halloween night, right?

420
00:45:23,922 --> 00:45:24,923
Right.

421
00:45:24,923 --> 00:45:28,218
Welll, I'm here tonight.
I'm not about to let anything happen to you.

422
00:45:29,052 --> 00:45:30,345
Promise?

423
00:45:30,345 --> 00:45:31,847
Promise.

424
00:45:31,847 --> 00:45:34,141
Can we make the Jack-O-Lantern now?

425
00:45:35,517 --> 00:45:36,518
Let's go.

426
00:45:59,124 --> 00:46:00,750
Hmm, terrific.

427
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:19,144
Hello?

428
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:22,522
Who's there?

429
00:46:24,316 --> 00:46:27,652
Paul, is this one of your cheap pranks?

430
00:46:31,323 --> 00:46:32,532
Guess not.

431
00:46:34,034 --> 00:46:36,244
No tricks for Annie tonight.

432
00:46:54,054 --> 00:46:55,639
Lindsey!

433
00:46:56,556 --> 00:46:58,517
Lindsey, come out here!

434
00:46:58,517 --> 00:47:02,521
Lindsey, I'm in the laundry room! The door wouldn't open!

435
00:47:02,521 --> 00:47:03,230
Spread out everybody.

436
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:05,649
We gonna try to figure out the shape of this thing.

437
00:47:07,025 --> 00:47:08,318
Holly cat.

438
00:47:08,318 --> 00:47:10,153
Hey.
- Yeah.

439
00:47:10,821 --> 00:47:14,449
Almost perfect.
What's wrong?

440
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:17,953
We finally got one.
- We found a plain sourcer.

441
00:47:18,453 --> 00:47:21,123
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone, it's Paul.

442
00:47:21,957 --> 00:47:23,750
Lindsey!

443
00:47:24,543 --> 00:47:27,129
Lindseeey!

444
00:47:45,021 --> 00:47:47,816
No, no answer. - Doctor, where are those fingers from?

445
00:47:47,816 --> 00:47:49,651
I don't know, Mr. Scott.
Hallo?

446
00:47:49,651 --> 00:47:52,529
Hi Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?

447
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:53,822
Yes, she is.

448
00:47:53,822 --> 00:47:55,240
Get her for me, will ya?

449
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,242
She's washing her clothes.

450
00:47:57,242 --> 00:47:59,536
Look, just tell her it's me, ok?

451
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:01,121
Ok.

452
00:48:06,126 --> 00:48:08,420
Annie, Paul called!

453
00:48:20,849 --> 00:48:24,019
You locked yourself there.
- I know.

454
00:48:26,021 --> 00:48:28,648
Pull my foot. I'm stuck!

455
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:50,545
Now promise me you won't tell anybody about this.

456
00:49:09,231 --> 00:49:11,733
She got stuck in a window. She'll be right here.

457
00:49:14,736 --> 00:49:16,738
Hello?
Hi Annie.

458
00:49:16,738 --> 00:49:18,949
Oh, hi Paul.
Stuck, huh?

459
00:49:18,949 --> 00:49:23,537
All right, cut it out. It can happen to anyone.
Sure ... stuck in the widow.

460
00:49:23,537 --> 00:49:27,124
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck in plenty of other positions!

461
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:28,542
My parents are gone.

462
00:49:28,542 --> 00:49:31,628
Oh that's fabulous. When did they leave?

463
00:49:31,628 --> 00:49:35,048
About half ago
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

464
00:49:36,049 --> 00:49:38,218
So why don't you just walk over?

465
00:49:38,218 --> 00:49:41,847
You coming pick me up.
- Well, I can't come now. My clothes are in the wash.

466
00:49:41,847 --> 00:49:47,644
Oh shut up jerk. Can't, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

467
00:49:47,644 --> 00:49:51,356
I think that's all you ever think about.
- That's not true, I think about lots of things.

468
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:55,318
Now why don't we not stand here
talking about them and get down to doing them?

469
00:49:56,528 --> 00:50:03,452
Lock your doors, bolt your window and turn off the lights.

470
00:50:03,452 --> 00:50:07,247
Don't go away ... cause here is a scene ...
- I'm scared.

471
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:09,749
Then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?

472
00:50:09,749 --> 00:50:12,919
I don't know.
- Well, come on get your coat.
We're going to pick up Paul.

473
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:15,255
I don't want to.

474
00:50:15,255 --> 00:50:20,635
Look, Lindsey, I thought we understood each other...
- I want to stay here and watch this.

475
00:50:20,635 --> 00:50:25,348
Okay, if I can fix it so you can watch TV
with Tommy Doyle, would you like that?

476
00:50:25,348 --> 00:50:28,226
Yes.
- Well, come with me.

477
00:50:33,648 --> 00:50:35,233
Come on! Hurry up.

478
00:51:01,134 --> 00:51:04,346
That strange that has to short it out.

479
00:51:04,846 --> 00:51:06,139
Hi Tommy.

480
00:51:06,139 --> 00:51:06,848
Hi.

481
00:51:06,848 --> 00:51:11,144
Come on in. We're making a Jack-O-Lantern.
- You know I wanna watch TV.

482
00:51:12,729 --> 00:51:14,356
Annie, come in here.

483
00:51:14,731 --> 00:51:18,652
...now the horrifying conclusion ...

484
00:51:18,652 --> 00:51:20,821
... to ... the them.

485
00:51:23,031 --> 00:51:24,533
Oh, fancy.

486
00:51:24,533 --> 00:51:26,952
This has not been my night.

487
00:51:28,537 --> 00:51:35,252
I spilled butter all over. My cloths are in the wash.
I got stuck in a window. - I'd like you call Ben Tramer
and tell him you're just fooling around.

488
00:51:35,252 --> 00:51:40,215
I can't. - Yes, you can. - No, he went drinking with
Mike Godfrey and he won't be back until late.

489
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:43,051
YOU'LL have to call him ... tomorrow.

490
00:51:43,051 --> 00:51:45,345
Besides, I'm on my way to pick up Paul.

491
00:51:46,346 --> 00:51:47,347
Wait a minute.

492
00:51:47,347 --> 00:51:52,352
If you watch her,
I'll CONSIDER talking to Ben Tramer in the morning.

493
00:51:52,727 --> 00:51:53,728
Deal.

494
00:51:55,230 --> 00:51:58,733
I thought Paul was grounded.
- He was. Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

495
00:51:58,733 --> 00:52:02,654
Listen, I'll call you in an hour or so, ok?
- Yeah.

496
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:04,239
Bye.

497
00:52:08,034 --> 00:52:10,620
The old girl scout comes through again.

498
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,554
# My Paul ... I give you all #

499
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:36,229
# No keys, but pleeease ... #
#my Paul #

500
00:53:06,051 --> 00:53:11,556
# Oh, Paul ... #
#I can no longer stall... #

501
00:53:11,556 --> 00:53:19,648
# Oh Paul. Oh Paul ...#
#I can no longer stall... #

502
00:53:19,648 --> 00:53:22,818
# Dearly Paul ... #

503
00:53:24,027 --> 00:53:26,029
# my Paul #

504
00:54:22,127 --> 00:54:22,752
Attention ...

505
00:54:22,752 --> 00:54:25,255
Captain and crew standby reverse polarity.

506
00:54:25,255 --> 00:54:29,050
Standard class A security will be maintained upon landing.

507
00:54:29,217 --> 00:54:32,220
And until further notice all land in and hold on.

508
00:54:32,220 --> 00:54:33,346
That is all.

509
00:54:33,638 --> 00:54:34,848
Artificial gravity are ...

510
00:54:34,848 --> 00:54:36,725
ad lock cut primary coarse.

511
00:54:36,725 --> 00:54:38,226
Primary stature.

512
00:55:02,417 --> 00:55:04,628
Lindsey ...

513
00:55:04,628 --> 00:55:06,254
Lindseyyy ....

514
00:55:06,755 --> 00:55:08,256
Where are you?

515
00:55:33,615 --> 00:55:40,038
There is the boogeyman! He is outside!
Look, there is the boogeyman outside! - What's wrong?

516
00:55:40,038 --> 00:55:43,917
I saw the boogeyman! I know that - Oh, Tommy stop it!
- But at Lindsey's! - You're scaring Lindsey.

517
00:55:43,917 --> 00:55:47,629
He's over there!
- Tommy, stop it! There is nobody out there!

518
00:55:48,046 --> 00:55:52,634
There's no boogeyman. And if you don't stop all this
I'll have to turn off the TV and send you to bed.

519
00:55:56,555 --> 00:56:01,143
Nobody believes me.
- I believe you, Tommy.

520
00:56:33,133 --> 00:56:34,134
I'm not afraid.

521
00:56:34,134 --> 00:56:35,427
Bull.

522
00:56:35,427 --> 00:56:37,220
I'm not.
- Then go in.

523
00:56:45,020 --> 00:56:46,146
Chicken.

524
00:56:46,146 --> 00:56:47,647
Go ahead, Lonnie.

525
00:56:48,732 --> 00:56:50,150
Go in!

526
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:54,154
Hey!

527
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:56,323
Hey, Lonnie ...

528
00:56:56,323 --> 00:56:58,950
Get your ass away from there ...

529
00:57:11,254 --> 00:57:12,547
Jesus.

530
00:57:12,547 --> 00:57:14,049
Are you all right here?

531
00:57:14,216 --> 00:57:15,550
Yeah.

532
00:57:15,550 --> 00:57:21,223
Well, nothing's going on except kids playing pranks,
trick or treating, partying, getting high.

533
00:57:21,223 --> 00:57:23,517
I have the feeling you're way off on this.

534
00:57:23,517 --> 00:57:26,728
You have the wrong feeling.
- You're not doing very much to prove me wrong.

535
00:57:26,728 --> 00:57:28,522
What more do you need?

536
00:57:28,522 --> 00:57:32,526
Well, it's going to take more than fancy talk
to keep me up all night crawling around these bushes.

537
00:57:32,526 --> 00:57:35,028
I, I, I watched him for fifteen years ...

538
00:57:35,028 --> 00:57:39,032
sitting in a room, staring at a wall, not seeing the wall ...

539
00:57:39,032 --> 00:57:40,534
looking past the wall

540
00:57:40,534 --> 00:57:43,954
looking at ... THIS NIGHT inhumanly patient.

541
00:57:45,747 --> 00:57:48,917
waiting for some secret, silent alarm ...

542
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:50,544
to trigger him off.

543
00:57:51,253 --> 00:57:54,923
Death has come to your little town, sheriff.

544
00:57:54,923 --> 00:57:58,135
You can either ignore it or you can help me to stop it.

545
00:57:58,635 --> 00:58:00,220
More fancy talk.

546
00:58:00,637 --> 00:58:02,556
Doctor, do you know what Haddonfield is?

547
00:58:02,556 --> 00:58:03,640
Families ...

548
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,852
Children ... all lined up in rows,
up and down these streets.

549
00:58:06,852 --> 00:58:09,229
You're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.

550
00:58:09,229 --> 00:58:10,856
They could be.

551
00:58:12,149 --> 00:58:14,234
All right, I'll stay with you out tonight ...

552
00:58:14,234 --> 00:58:15,527
just on the chance that you're right.

553
00:58:16,653 --> 00:58:18,155
And if you are right ...

554
00:58:18,655 --> 00:58:21,032
damn you for letting him go.

555
00:58:42,721 --> 00:58:45,724
So we gonna first, we'll go inside, right?
Then we just talk a little.

556
00:58:45,724 --> 00:58:50,729
Then Annie will distract Lindsey, that's when we'll
go upstairs to the first bedroom on the left. You got it?

557
00:58:50,729 --> 00:58:53,023
First I rip your clothes off ...

558
00:58:53,023 --> 00:58:56,735
Don't rip, my blouse is expensive, idiot.
- Then you rip my clothes off...

559
00:58:56,735 --> 00:58:59,654
then we rip Lyndsey's cloth off. Yeah, I think I got it.

560
00:58:59,654 --> 00:59:00,655
Totally.

561
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,220
Bob ... put me down.

562
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,139
Put me down. This is totally silly.

563
00:59:26,139 --> 00:59:27,349
Put me down.

564
00:59:30,519 --> 00:59:32,729
Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

565
00:59:33,647 --> 00:59:34,856
Annie!

566
00:59:35,232 --> 00:59:38,151
Annie, we're here!
- I wonder where they went.

567
00:59:39,027 --> 00:59:41,738
Annie probably took Lindsey out or something.

568
00:59:50,122 --> 00:59:51,623
Hey, let's look for a note.

569
00:59:51,957 --> 00:59:53,125
Let's not.

570
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:29,244
He's gonna get you ...

571
01:00:29,244 --> 01:00:33,248
No, he's not. - Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

572
01:00:49,347 --> 01:00:51,850
Everybody's having good time tonight.

573
01:00:52,517 --> 01:00:54,352
All right, guys, what's next?

574
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:58,356
Let's make more popcorn. - No, we had enough.
Why don't we watch the rest of the movie?

575
01:00:58,523 --> 01:00:59,524
Yeah.

576
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:04,738
All right, put it back on.

577
01:01:17,042 --> 01:01:18,418
Doyle house.

578
01:01:18,418 --> 01:01:20,545
Hi Laurie ... what's up?

579
01:01:20,545 --> 01:01:22,756
I'm just setting down for the first time tonight.

580
01:01:23,632 --> 01:01:25,217
Hey ... is Annie around?

581
01:01:25,634 --> 01:01:26,927
No, I thought she'd be home by now.

582
01:01:26,927 --> 01:01:30,347
She went to pick up Paul.
- Well, she's totally not here.

583
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:34,017
She's probably stopped off some place.

584
01:01:34,017 --> 01:01:38,021
Have her call me when she gets home.
I've got Lyndsey here and I want to know
what time to put her to bed.

585
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:41,650
Okay. Later.
- Have a good time.

586
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:43,735
We definetely will.

587
01:01:44,653 --> 01:01:45,821
Bye.

588
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:52,744
Lindsey is gone for the night.
- Hey, now that's wonderful.

589
01:02:35,954 --> 01:02:38,039
Oh, shit! Not again.

590
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:40,041
I can't help it. The phone keeps ringing.

591
01:02:40,625 --> 01:02:43,545
Oh, I can't keep you interested, huh?
- Just answer that damn phone.

592
01:02:44,045 --> 01:02:46,548
I can't. What if it's the Wallaces?

593
01:02:46,548 --> 01:02:48,216
We'd get Annie in trouble now.

594
01:02:52,637 --> 01:02:54,222
Just take it off the hook.

595
01:03:28,924 --> 01:03:30,926
Fantastic.

596
01:03:33,345 --> 01:03:36,139
Totally.
- Yeah.

597
01:03:47,526 --> 01:03:49,236
Is that all you can say?

598
01:03:49,236 --> 01:03:50,028
Yeah.

599
01:03:53,031 --> 01:03:56,034
Go get me a beer.
- I thought you were gonna get me one.

600
01:03:56,034 --> 01:03:57,119
Yeaah.

601
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:01,248
I'll be right back.

602
01:04:01,248 --> 01:04:03,416
Don't get dressed.

603
01:04:59,222 --> 01:05:00,223
Annie?

604
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:02,517
Paul?

605
01:05:06,354 --> 01:05:08,648
Lynda, you asshole!

606
01:05:12,819 --> 01:05:14,237
Ok, Lynda.

607
01:05:14,237 --> 01:05:15,322
Come on out.

608
01:06:18,552 --> 01:06:19,845
Well, did you get my beer?

609
01:06:27,018 --> 01:06:29,229
Cute, Bob. Real cute.

610
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:43,118
See anything you like?

611
01:06:51,126 --> 01:06:53,545
What's the matter? Can I get your ghost, Bob?

612
01:07:02,053 --> 01:07:04,055
All right, all right. Come on, where is my beer?

613
01:07:10,353 --> 01:07:12,022
Ok, ain't answer me?

614
01:07:16,234 --> 01:07:17,736
Ok, don't answer me?

615
01:07:19,154 --> 01:07:22,449
Oh, you're weird!
- I'm gonna call Laurie.

616
01:07:22,449 --> 01:07:25,035
Well, I'm gonna call Laurie.
I wanna know where Annie and Paul are.

617
01:07:25,035 --> 01:07:26,536
This is going nowhere.

618
01:07:30,749 --> 01:07:32,125
Finally.

619
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:39,132
Hello.

620
01:07:42,427 --> 01:07:43,345
Hello?

621
01:07:46,223 --> 01:07:50,644
All right, Annie. First I get your famous chewing,
now I get your famous squealing?

622
01:07:54,856 --> 01:07:56,316
Annie, you all right?

623
01:08:06,451 --> 01:08:08,245
Are you fooling around again?

624
01:08:09,746 --> 01:08:11,540
I'll kill you if this is a joke.

625
01:08:12,457 --> 01:08:13,416
Annie?

626
01:08:16,419 --> 01:08:17,420
Annie?

627
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,555
Sleep tight, kids.

628
01:12:19,538 --> 01:12:20,747
Paul?

629
01:12:21,748 --> 01:12:23,041
Lynda?

630
01:12:31,133 --> 01:12:32,217
Lynda?

631
01:12:43,728 --> 01:12:44,855
Annie?

632
01:13:02,956 --> 01:13:03,748
Annie?

633
01:13:07,127 --> 01:13:08,253
Lynda?

634
01:13:10,922 --> 01:13:11,923
Bob?

635
01:13:27,647 --> 01:13:29,024
All right, Annie ...

636
01:13:54,257 --> 01:13:56,426
All right, meatheads. The joke's over.

637
01:14:01,056 --> 01:14:02,057
Come on, Annie.

638
01:14:02,057 --> 01:14:03,141
It's enough.

639
01:14:07,145 --> 01:14:10,023
This is most definitely stopping funny.
Now cut it out!

640
01:14:13,318 --> 01:14:14,736
You'll be sorry.

641
01:17:26,636 --> 01:17:27,637
No.

642
01:17:53,747 --> 01:17:55,040
Help!

01:18:23,235 --> 01:18:24,820
Can't you hear me?!

657
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,530
Oh,God ...

01:19:17,038 --> 01:19:19,124
Tommy please!

668
01:19:22,544 --> 01:19:25,422
Hurry up! Tommy please!

669
01:19:25,422 --> 01:19:28,133
Tommy, go upstairs. - What is it, Laurie?
- Tommy go back upstairs,
grab the Lindsey and lock the door.

670
01:19:28,133 --> 01:19:31,553
I'm scared!- Do what I say! Now!
- It's the boogeyman, isn't it? - Hurry!

671
01:19:43,732 --> 01:19:45,233
Oh, no ...

672
01:20:00,415 --> 01:20:01,917
Please, stop.

673
01:20:01,917 --> 01:20:03,418
Please ...

674
01:21:18,535 --> 01:21:22,247
Where were you? I went to the Meyers house.
- I found the car. He is here!

675
01:21:22,247 --> 01:21:26,543
Where? - He's three blocks down.
You go around back off the houses, I'll watch the front.

676
01:21:26,752 --> 01:21:27,627
Go on!

677
01:21:58,116 --> 01:22:00,035
Tommy ... Lyndsey ...

678
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,622
Babies ...

679
01:22:07,417 --> 01:22:09,252
We're gonna take a little walk.

680
01:22:09,252 --> 01:22:10,545
Was it the boogeyman?

681
01:22:11,254 --> 01:22:13,423
-I'm scared.
-There's nothing to be scared of.

682
01:22:13,423 --> 01:22:14,925
Are you sure?

683
01:22:16,218 --> 01:22:17,427
How?

684
01:22:17,719 --> 01:22:19,137
I killed him.

685
01:22:19,846 --> 01:22:21,848
You can't kill the boogeyman.

686
01:22:25,644 --> 01:22:28,230
Get in there! Come on, Tommy! Now, lock the door!

687
01:25:06,346 --> 01:25:07,722
Tommy ...

688
01:25:07,722 --> 01:25:09,057
Unlock the door.

689
01:25:12,519 --> 01:25:13,645
Come here.

690
01:25:14,521 --> 01:25:15,522
Now just listen to me ...

691
01:25:16,648 --> 01:25:18,150
I want you to go down the stairs ...

692
01:25:18,150 --> 01:25:19,734
and out the front door.

693
01:25:19,734 --> 01:25:22,154
And I want you to go down the street
to the Mackenzies' house ...

694
01:25:22,529 --> 01:25:24,739
I want you to tell them to call the police.

695
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:26,741
And tell them to send them over here.

696
01:25:26,741 --> 01:25:28,618
Laurie ...
- Now, do you understand me?

697
01:25:28,618 --> 01:25:30,245
Yes. - Go. Do as I say.

698
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:52,851
Get help!

699
01:25:52,851 --> 01:25:54,019
Come on!

700
01:25:54,352 --> 01:25:55,645
Come on!

701
01:27:19,855 --> 01:27:21,648
Was that the boogeyman?

702
01:27:27,028 --> 01:27:28,655
As a matter of fact ...

703
01:27:28,655 --> 01:27:29,739
it was.
