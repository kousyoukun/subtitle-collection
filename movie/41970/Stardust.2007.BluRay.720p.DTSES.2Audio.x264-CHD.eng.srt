1
00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,970
Aphilosopher once asked,

2
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:46,568
"Are we human because we gaze at the stars,

3
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:50,409
"or do we gaze at them because we are human?"

4
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:52,910
Pointless, really-

5
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,879
Do the stars gaze back?

6
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:58,753
Now, that's a question-

7
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,559
But I'm getting ahead of myself-

8
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,824
Our story really begins here,

9
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:09,560
1 50 years ago at the Royal Academy of Science

10
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,966
in London, England,

11
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:17,808
where a letter arrived, containing a very strange inquiry-

12
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:21,908
It had come from a country boy

13
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:27,179
and the scientist who read it thought it might be a practical joke of some kind-

14
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,914
But he duly wrote a reply

15
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,185
politely explaining that the query was nonsense-

16
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:39,258
And posted it to the boy who lived in a village called Wall,

17
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:43,460
so named, the boy had said, for the wall that ran alongside it-

18
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:49,530
A wall that, according to local folklore, hid an extraordinary secret-

19
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,101
I'm charged with guarding the portal to another world.

20
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,650
And you're asking me to just Iet you through?

21
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,652
Yes. Because, Iet's be honest, it's a field.

22
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:06,121
Look, do you see another world out there?

23
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:10,821
No. You see a field. Do you see anything nonhuman?

24
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,421
No. And you know why? Because it's a field!

25
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,764
Hundreds of years, this wall's been here.

26
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,637
Hundreds of years, this gap's been under 24-hour guard.

27
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,574
-Well... -One more word,

28
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:29,636
and I'll have you up in front of the village council!

29
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:34,448
-Well, that sounds rather final. -Yeah.

30
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:40,882
-Better just go home, then, I suppose. -Right, then. Night, Dunstan.

31
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,854
Give my best to your father.

32
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,157
Stop!

33
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,693
Stop!

34
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,841
I don't deal with time-wasters.

35
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,747
Get over here and tend this stall.

36
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,786
I'm off to The SIaughtered Prince for a pint.

37
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,958
See anything you like?

38
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,430
Definitely.

39
00:03:55,534 --> 00:04:00,198
I mean, what I meant was these ones, the blue ones.

40
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,767
How much are they?

41
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:05,741
They might be the color of your hair.

42
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:09,974
Or they might be all of your memories before you were three.

43
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,346
I can check if you like.

44
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:16,888
Anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells. Buy this one instead.

45
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,154
Snowdrop.

46
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,024
It'll bring you Iuck.

47
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,330
But what does that cost?

48
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,966
This one costs a kiss.

49
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,589
Is she gone?

50
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:54,889
Follow me.

51
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,002
I'm a princess, tricked into being a witch's slave.

52
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,967
Will you liberate me?

53
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:25,714
It's an enchanted chain. I'll only be free when she dies.

54
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,150
Sorry.

55
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:32,958
Well, if I can't liberate you, what do you want of me?

56
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,307
So, the scientist was wrong-

57
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
The wall had successfully done its job

58
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,655
of hiding the magical kingdom of Stormhold-

59
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,628
The young man returned that night to his home in England,

60
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:08,962
hoping that his adventure would soon be forgotten-

61
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:14,027
But nine months later, he received an unexpected souvenir-

62
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:27,677
This was Ieft at the wall for you. It says here his name is Tristan.

63
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,677
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.

64
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,374
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.

65
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:03,187
Eighteen years passed, and the baby Tristan grew up

66
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,621
knowing nothing of his unconventional heritage-

67
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:12,358
But never mind how the infant became a boy-

68
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:16,764
This is the story of how Tristan Thorn becomes a man,

69
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:20,127
a much greater challenge altogether-

70
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,437
For to achieve it,

71
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:27,603
he must win the heart of his one true love-

72
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,612
-It's him! -It's him!

73
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:36,788
Humphrey?

74
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:37,049
Humphrey?

75
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,647
-No, it's Tristan. -Oh.

76
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,186
Did I Ieave something at the shop?

77
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,730
No. I just thought I could bring...

78
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,193
Tristan Thorn,

79
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:53,203
shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.

80
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,569
Is there no end to your charms?

81
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,702
Humphrey, there's no need to be like that.

82
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,744
Be nice to the poor boy.

83
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,981
Were those for Victoria?

84
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,358
You were always useless at fencing in school, Tristan.

85
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,799
In fact, I'm having trouble remembering if there was anything you were good at.

86
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,303
Humphrey, that's enough.

87
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:34,036
Are you all right?

88
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,373
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

89
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,368
-Want some breakfast? -No, I'm really Iate for work.

90
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:04,203
-Are you all right? -Yeah. Fine. Why?

91
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:08,803
Oh, I don't know. Last night, how'd it go?

92
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:12,315
Oh, really good. Really, really good.

93
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,863
Hello, Tristan.

94
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,458
-Victoria. -Pound of sugar, please.

95
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:37,599
-Yes. -Let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.

96
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,769
Oh, Iook, I'm sorry about Iast night. Humphrey was really rude.

97
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,474
I also need a sack of potatoes and some chocolate, please.

98
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,721
May I perhaps see you tonight?

99
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,249
No, but you may walk me home.

100
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,652
Now?

101
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,323
Yes. Yes, I can.

102
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,502
Father, I Iost my job.

103
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,873
Father, I don't... I Iost my job. I'm sorry.

104
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,173
-Father... -You Iost your job.

105
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,539
Yes, so I heard.

106
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:20,683
Father, I'm sorry. I...

107
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,621
Maybe Mr. Monday was right. Maybe I am deluding myself.

108
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:28,955
-I'm not good enough for Victoria. -He said that? That's poppycock.

109
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,823
You really want to know how it went Iast night?

110
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,021
Yeah.

111
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,193
Not good.

112
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,691
Come on. I'm wasting my time.

113
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,234
I'm not like Humphrey.

114
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:45,709
Tristan, I can tell you that every man I ever envied when I was a boy

115
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,605
has Ied an unremarkable life.

116
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:54,344
So you don't fit with the popular crowd. Now, I take that as a very good omen.

117
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:10,129
-Tristan, I clearly said... -I know. You told me not to come.

118
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,829
I have something for you. A surprise.

119
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,030
No...

120
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,414
It's not my birthday for another week, you know.

121
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:39,327
-I've never had champagne before. -Yeah, me, neither.

122
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:43,098
My God! This is delicious!

123
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,770
How did... Well, how does a shop boy afford all of this?

124
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,567
I'm not a shop boy.

125
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,703
God! I heard. I'm sorry. What are you going to do now?

126
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:56,577
No. I mean, I'm not a shop boy. I was just working in a shop.

127
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,912
And now I'm not. Now I'm free to live my life as I wish.

128
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,486
This must have been all your savings.

129
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,613
So? I can make more. That's the beauty of it.

130
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,316
I never intended to stay in Wall, Victoria.

131
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,758
There's a big world out there, I'm gonna make my fortune.

132
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,490
Now you sound just like Humphrey. He's quite a traveler.

133
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:17,830
Do you know he's going all the way to ipswich just to buy me a ring?

134
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,369
ipswich?

135
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:23,430
Victoria, I'm talking about London or Paris or...

136
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,341
A ring? Why is he... What kind of a ring?

137
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,312
The word is he's planning to propose to me on my birthday.

138
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,006
He's going to...

139
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,750
And you're gonna say yes.

140
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:38,380
I can't exactly say no after he's gone all the way to ipswich.

141
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,583
"All the way to ipswich"?

142
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:45,595
Victoria, for your hand in marriage, I'd cross oceans or continents.

143
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,921
-Really? -Yes.

144
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,431
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

145
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,901
I would go to the gold fields of San Francisco

146
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,472
and bring you back your weight in gold.

147
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,602
I would.

148
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:02,570
I'd go to Africa and bring you back a diamond as big as your fist.

149
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:06,181
Or I'd go to the Arctic and I'd slaughter a polar bear

150
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,411
and bring you back its head.

151
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,483
A polar bear's head?

152
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,025
You're funny, Tristan.

153
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:23,066
People like you and people like me, we're just not...

154
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,405
I should be going. It's really Iate.

155
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:32,033
Well, hold on, then. Let's at Ieast finish the champagne.

156
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:34,336
Okay.

157
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:42,776
Had Tristan known then how the stars watched Earth,

158
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,684
he'd have shuddered at the very thought

159
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,189
of an audience to his humiliation-

160
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,356
But, fortunately for him,

161
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,431
nearly every star in the sky was at that moment

162
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:58,662
Iooking in earnest at the land on the other side of the wall,

163
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,331
where the King of all Stormhold lay on his deathbed,

164
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,342
which was a coincidence because it was the King's final act

165
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:11,814
that would change the course of Tristan's destiny forever-

166
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,985
Where is Secundus?

167
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,980
He's on his way, Father.

168
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,785
Then we shall wait.

169
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:34,432
Sorry I'm Iate, Father. I came as swiftly as I was able.

170
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,572
Septimus.

171
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,206
Primus.

172
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:44,542
Tertius.

173
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:49,685
So, to the matter of succession.

174
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:56,592
Of my seven sons, there are four of you today still standing.

175
00:14:56,694 --> 00:15:00,994
This is quite a break with tradition. I had 12 brothers.

176
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,896
And you killed them all for your throne

177
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:06,027
before your father, the King, even felt poorly.

178
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,604
We know, Father. You're strong and courageous.

179
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:13,575
And cunning. Most importantly, cunning.

180
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,042
-Secundus. -Yes, Father?

181
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,449
Look through the window. Tell me what you see.

182
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:31,319
I see the kingdom, Father.

183
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,759
The whole of Stormhold.

184
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:38,563
-And? -My kingdom?

185
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,070
Maybe. Look up.

186
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:12,695
-Secundus. -Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.

187
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:18,001
You're alive. You're...

188
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:21,010
Stuck like this till the new king is crowned.

189
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,974
I was that close.

190
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,346
Well, at Ieast you haven't Iost your Iooks.

191
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:29,352
Oh, please. You're not annoyed about that whole murder thing, are you?

192
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:32,446
-I mean, that was 10 years ago. -Yeah.

193
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,457
Great deal of good it did you, didn't it, killing me, Secundus?

194
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,824
Because now, of course, now you are King of all Stormhold.

195
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,796
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not. You're dead.

196
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:44,061
Una? Una?

197
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:48,229
No, Father, it's me, your son.

198
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,368
Tertius.

199
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:55,507
Where is your sister, Una?

200
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,912
Sorry, Father. Nobody has seen Una for years now.

201
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,212
-Septimus? -What?

202
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,814
Tradition dictates the throne must pass to a male heir.

203
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:09,051
Exactly, Father.

204
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,890
So why would I kill my sister when these cretins are still alive?

205
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,156
Indeed.

206
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:20,502
Therefore, we shall resolve the situation in a non-traditional manner.

207
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:49,565
Only he of royal blood can restore the ruby.

208
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:56,300
And the one of you that does so shall be the new King of Stormhold.

209
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,586
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!

210
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,192
Beautiful.

211
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,368
More beautiful than a fancy ring from ipswich?

212
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:05,973
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

213
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:09,740
I'd cross the wall and I'd bring you back that fallen star.

214
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,005
You can't cross the wall.

215
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,977
Nobody crosses the wall. Now you're just being silly.

216
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,919
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.

217
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,681
For you, I'd do anything.

218
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,561
My very own star.

219
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,928
It seems we have ourselves an agreement.

220
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:35,270
You have exactly one week or I'm marrying Humphrey.

221
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,438
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!

222
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,941
-What is it? -A star has fallen.

223
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,591
Where are the Babylon candles?

224
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:10,395
You used the Iast one, Lamia, 200 years ago. Do you not recall?

225
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,136
Perhaps we can obtain another.

226
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:12,761
Perhaps we can obtain another.

227
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,306
Has your mind become as decrepit as your face, Empusa?

228
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:19,171
You speak as if such things are freely available.

229
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,642
I know, sister, I merely thought...

230
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:22,269
You'd have us hunting for a Babylon candle

231
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,144
while some other witch finds our star.

232
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,843
Fool. There's no time to waste.

233
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,384
If we must retrieve it on foot, then we shall.

234
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,582
Mormo, we need information.

235
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:47,702
If these divinations are correct, the fallen star lies 1 00 miles away.

236
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:56,211
Four centuries we've waited for this. What hardship a few more days?

237
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,750
Which of us shall go, then, to seek it and bring it back?

238
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,723
-I've his kidney. -I've his liver.

239
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,522
And I've his heart.

240
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:17,157
You'll be needing what's Ieft of the Iast star.

241
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:27,975
-There's not much Ieft. -Soon, there'll be plenty for us all.

242
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:28,998
-Dunstan Thorn. Not again. -It's Tristan, actually.

243
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:33,833
Oh. You do Iook a bit like your father.

244
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:37,402
And I suppose you intend to cross the wall as well, do you?

245
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,346
Well, you can forget it. Go home.

246
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,611
Cross the wall as well as who?

247
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,751
No one. Nobody.

248
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:47,323
Nobody crosses the wall. You know that!

249
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,689
Everybody knows that!

250
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:53,321
Yeah... No, no, I know. I understand. Nobody.

251
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,532
Well, I better just head for the old homestead, then.

252
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:58,761
Yeah.

253
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:03,033
-Right, then. Night, Tristan. -Good night.

254
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,233
Give my best to your father.

255
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:29,730
Off you go.

256
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:39,072
I thought I heard you come in. Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?

257
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:40,404
No, I'm fine.

258
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,001
-That Humphrey again? -No.

259
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:45,445
Actually, it was the guard. The guard at the wall.

260
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,749
Tristan, he's 97 years old.

261
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:51,982
Well, that's given him plenty of time to practice, then, hasn't it?

262
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,653
Why, may I ask, were you trying to cross the wall?

263
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:00,226
I might ask you the same thing.

264
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,572
I have a mother.

265
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,985
I mean, I have a mother. She could still be alive.

266
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:59,021
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.

267
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,587
The chain you cut.

268
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,094
Just like you said.

269
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,323
And...

270
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:13,936
And the glass flower. The flower she sold to you.

271
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:16,029
She told me it would bring me Iuck.

272
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,437
Thank you.

273
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:22,406
This was also in the basket. I've never opened it.

274
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,978
It's addressed to you.

275
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:42,424
Yep.

276
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:47,027
"My dearest Tristan, please know that I only ever wanted the best for you."

277
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:52,499
Had my mistress allowed it, I would have kept you in a heartbeat-

278
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:56,711
My dearest wish is that we will meet someday-

279
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:01,249
The fastest way to travel is by candlelight-

280
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:05,554
To use it, think of me and only me-

281
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,424
I will think of you every day, for always-

282
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,530
"Your mother."

283
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,332
Well, do you... Do you have a light?

284
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:09,683
Mother?

285
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:13,018
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

286
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:16,388
No, I'm not. And I'm not your mother, so get off me!

287
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,588
You're... You're not my mother?

288
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,995
Do I Iook like I'm your mother?

289
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,391
No.

290
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,862
Sorry.

291
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:29,867
Well, are you all right? Do you want some help?

292
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,339
You can help by Ieaving me alone!

293
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,941
All right.

294
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:45,587
Oh, my God. "Light the candle and think of me."

295
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,714
I was. I was thinking of my...

296
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:50,555
But then Victoria and the star just popped into...

297
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,523
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.

298
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,535
This may seem strange, but have you seen a fallen star anywhere?

299
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,136
-You're funny. -No, really, we're in a crater.

300
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,333
This must be where it fell.

301
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,403
Yeah, this is where it fell.

302
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:10,480
It is. Or if you want to be really specific,

303
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,913
up there is where this weird, bloody necklace

304
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,143
came out of nowhere and knocked it out of the heavens

305
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,083
when it was minding its own business.

306
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,087
And over there is where it Ianded.

307
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:24,957
And right here, this is where it got hit by a magical flying moron!

308
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:31,363
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

309
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:36,631
Oh, wow. I'm sorry. I had no idea you'd be a...

310
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,473
May I just say in advance that I am sorry?

311
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:43,905
-Sorry for what? -For this.

312
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:46,915
Now, if I am not mistaken, this means you have to come with me.

313
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:50,680
See, you're going to be a birthday gift for Victoria, my true Iove.

314
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,153
But of course!

315
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,249
Nothing says romance like the gift of a kidnapped, injured woman!

316
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:58,891
I'm not going anywhere with you.

317
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:07,035
Hurry. You should be on your way now, Primus.

318
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:12,298
You must find the royal necklace with the ruby before your brothers.

319
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:16,812
I should like to see you take the throne. The first benevolent king.

320
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:21,508
I don't doubt Stormhold would be a better place under your rule.

321
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:22,846
Really?

322
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:25,444
Well, that is fascinating.

323
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,683
-Don't you think, Tertius? -Yes, indeed.

324
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:32,592
Prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well. Well, well, I...

325
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,194
Since you're all here, won't you join me in a toast?

326
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:40,563
What a very good idea.

327
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:43,071
To the new King of Stormhold,

328
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,404
whichever of you fine fellows it might be.

329
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:49,339
To the new King of Stormhold.

330
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:31,779
You!

331
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,874
You really thought that you were king?

332
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:01,582
-You killed the Bishop? -No, Primus.

333
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:06,520
I think you'll find that you killed the Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.

334
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,525
Oh, Iook, when you finish wrestling with your conscience,

335
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:12,356
may I suggest you return to your chamber?

336
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:14,862
Leave the quest for the stone to me.

337
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,937
How have we lived this way all these years?

338
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:41,880
In my absence, I expect you to make it fit for the queens we are.

339
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,861
When I return with our prize, all of us shall be young again.

340
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,692
Never fear, my sisters.

341
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:54,795
I will not fail.

342
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:06,681
Don't you ever sleep?

343
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:07,750
Not at night.

344
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:09,583
May have escaped your notice, genius,

345
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,711
but that's when stars have rather better things to do.

346
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:14,120
They're coming out, shining, that sort of thing.

347
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:17,455
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours, but you're not in the sky anymore.

348
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,529
Coming out is off the agenda.

349
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:23,326
Shining has been suspended until further notice.

350
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,869
Oh, and sleeping during the day is O-U-T.

351
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:31,062
Unless you have some magical ability to sleep while you're walking.

352
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:33,540
Have you not got it into your thick head yet?

353
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,634
I'm not walking anywhere!

354
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,539
Fine.

355
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:41,141
Sit in a crater. I've had enough of you anyway.

356
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:44,112
I was gonna put you back in the sky once I'd brought you to my Victoria,

357
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:47,418
but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own in the middle of nowhere forever.

358
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,891
And just how were you planning to get me back to the sky?

359
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:54,259
I find the fastest way to travel is by candlelight.

360
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:58,566
-You've got a Babylon candle. -Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.

361
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,226
-A Babylon candle. -That's what I said.

362
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:01,326
You said "Bubbling."

363
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:03,838
Anyway, I was going to give what's Ieft of it to you.

364
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,272
Well, that barely has one use Ieft.

365
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:10,870
So be grateful I'm not using it right now to get us both back to the wall.

366
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:14,348
Unless you have a better way of getting yourself home.

367
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,113
Fine!

368
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,216
Help me up.

369
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:23,291
All right. All right. I'm helping.

370
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,253
And you are gonna have to walk quicker than that.

371
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:29,127
Otherwise, I'll never get you back to Victoria in a week.

372
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,699
Don't push your Iuck.

373
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:36,437
Don't take Iess than a florin for him, Bernard! You understand?

374
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,667
-Yes, Mother. -No dilly-dallying!

375
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:42,677
And don't even think of stopping at the tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!

376
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,906
A florin for your goat, boy.

377
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:48,785
Oh.

378
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:52,755
He's a bit small to pull your cart.

379
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:56,319
You're quite right.

380
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,365
That's much better.

381
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:14,271
Bernard!

382
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:17,341
Bernard!

383
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:40,763
Get on!

384
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,270
Who goes there?

385
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,366
What do you want with me, a poor old flower...

386
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,412
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are

387
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:28,143
and I swear by the ordinances of the sisterhood to which we both belong

388
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:30,719
that I mean you no harm this day.

389
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,811
I wish to share your meal.

390
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:39,126
Well, one can never be too careful. Sit down. I'll get you a seat.

391
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,868
-Anything else? -Nope.

392
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,034
What's it to be?

393
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,203
Heads or tails?

394
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,041
Heads.

395
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,579
So, stranger,

396
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,045
where are you headed off to on this fine day?

397
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,090
I seek a fallen star.

398
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,956
She fell not far from here.

399
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,291
And when I find her, I shall take my great knife

400
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,864
and cut out her heart while she still lives.

401
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:20,426
And the glory of our youth shall be restored.

402
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,403
Fallen star?

403
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:26,098
That's the best news I've had in ages.

404
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,973
I could do with Iosing a few years meself.

405
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,138
So whereabouts did you...

406
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,772
Limbus grass!

407
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:38,218
You dare to steal truth from my lips by feeding me limbus grass?

408
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:42,587
Do you have any idea what a big mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?

409
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,786
How do you know my...

410
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,886
-Who are you? -Look again.

411
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:54,335
I shall not seek the star, Your Dark Majesty. I swear.

412
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,098
Seek all you wish.

413
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,733
You shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it.

414
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:06,306
You will not perceive her even if she stands before you.

415
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,259
Pray you never meet me again, Ditchwater Sal.

416
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,952
Oh, right. So Iet me get this straight.

417
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:21,622
You think you know we're going the right way because...

418
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:24,495
And I quote, "I just do."

419
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,296
I do, though. I don't know why.

420
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:29,065
Maybe it's my Iove for Victoria guiding me home.

421
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,730
-PIease. -Yvonne, whether you like it or not...

422
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,468
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...

423
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,874
How many times do I have to...

424
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:38,743
Would you... Would you please slow down?

425
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,110
Yes, yes.

426
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,212
Look, we're... We're going north, all right?

427
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,582
The wall's north.

428
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:47,851
And if you Iook up in the sky, even during the day, you can see the...

429
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,652
The evening star. That's so weird.

430
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,624
That's funny. Hilarious. My sides are splitting.

431
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,320
No, I'm being...

432
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:57,694
Wait that... That was you! Really?

433
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,731
What... What are...

434
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:03,169
-What are you doing? -What does it Iook like I'm doing?

435
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:05,434
-Sitting down. I'm tired. -PIease don't do this again.

436
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,010
We agreed we'd stop off at the next village to eat and rest.

437
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,080
Come on, Tristan. It's midday.

438
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:16,015
I never stay up this Iate! Just, please, Iet me sleep!

439
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:21,347
Okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep. I'll go and get something to eat.

440
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:29,325
What are you doing?

441
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:33,664
What does it Iook like I'm doing? I'm making sure you don't run away.

442
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:54,189
Your Highness, the soothsayer, as you requested.

443
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,217
South, you said.

444
00:39:58,194 --> 00:39:59,684
South we went.

445
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,655
Still no stone.

446
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,694
Do you now propose we start swimming?

447
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:11,866
Sire, I've merely relayed to you what the runes have told me.

448
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,567
I can do no more.

449
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,812
Well, consult them again.

450
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,339
Wait.

451
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:25,344
Before we seek the stone, I have another question.

452
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,087
Am I the seventh son?

453
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,722
Yes.

454
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,458
Another question.

455
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,828
Is my favorite color blue?

456
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,529
Yes.

457
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:48,372
Has excessive begging or pleading ever persuaded me

458
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,742
to spare the life of a traitor?

459
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,574
What does that mean?

460
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,245
-That means no. -Good.

461
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:02,157
Throw them again. This time, throw them high.

462
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,288
Do you work for my brother?

463
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:27,740
So, do we continue west?

464
00:41:58,214 --> 00:41:59,408
Tristan?

465
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:09,823
Who's there?

466
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,063
Tristan, is that you?

467
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:21,659
It's not funny.

468
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,237
Tristan?

469
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,648
Come on.

470
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,625
Be careful how much magic you use, sister.

471
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:26,531
It's beginning to show.

472
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,969
One goat and a small enchantment. Hardly extravagant.

473
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:33,008
Well, even using the ring will take its toll.

474
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:35,441
Better you call on us only in dire need.

475
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:38,844
And use your runes to Iocate the star yourself.

476
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,848
But now they're just telling me gibberish.

477
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:04,102
It is because you must stay where you are, my sister.

478
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,435
She is coming to you.

479
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,169
Oh, be warned, Lamia. Delicacy is needed.

480
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:12,304
Misery has drained her. She's barely shining.

481
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,148
Set a trap that ensures her heart is glowing before you cut it out.

482
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:21,150
Yvaine! Yvaine!

483
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,515
Oh, you idiot.

484
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:47,909
You shall become human.

485
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:09,159
You are Billy, the innkeeper. I am your wife, and you're our daughter.

486
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:13,725
Now, make everything ready. Our special guest will be here soon.

487
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:28,743
I mean, who's to say he'd have even kept his promise about the candle?

488
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,514
I just refuse to believe he's the only person in Stormhold

489
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:34,317
who could've helped me.

490
00:46:34,423 --> 00:46:38,689
Going on and on and on. Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."

491
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,325
Tristan?

492
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,360
Please protect our sister, Tristan-

493
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:50,236
Yvaine is in grave danger-

494
00:46:51,073 --> 00:46:53,371
The unicorn came to help her-

495
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,601
But now they're heading into a trap-

496
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:03,414
No star is safe in Stormhold-

497
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:08,653
The last to fall, 400 years ago,

498
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:14,094
was captured by the same witches who seek Yvaine now-

499
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:16,925
They tricked her,

500
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:19,957
cared for her,

501
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,899
and when her heart was once more aglow,

502
00:47:25,508 --> 00:47:28,875
they cut it from her chest

503
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:31,573
and ate it-

504
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,118
There's no time to waste-

505
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,948
A coach is coming-

506
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:41,683
By any means possible, you must get on it-

507
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:43,383
Run-

508
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:15,415
Whoa!

509
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,892
If Septimus insists on sending a boy to do a man's job...

510
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:27,992
No, no, no, wait, please!

511
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:29,969
I don't know a Septimus. I just need a lift.

512
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:32,870
Look at me, Iook at me. I'm unarmed. PIease.

513
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:35,368
PIease, Iet me ride with you.

514
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:38,845
I'm afraid that's impossible. I'm on a quest of enormous importance.

515
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:40,848
Well, then all the more reason to take me with you.

516
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,442
There may come a time when you need a second pair of hands. Sir?

517
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:48,182
PIease. Maybe providence sent me to you just as it sent you to me.

518
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:52,321
-Get on. -Oh, yes. Thank you.

519
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,947
Goodness me, my dear. Come in out of this wretched rain!

520
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:25,622
We have food and drink, a warm bed and plenty of hot water for a bath.

521
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:48,878
How do you like your bath? Warm, hot or boil-a-Iobster?

522
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:51,013
I honestly don't know.

523
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,519
Then Iet me choose for you,

524
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:55,818
and I'll have my husband take your horse to the stable.

525
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:57,918
Billy?

526
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:12,069
Now, Iet's get you out of your wet things, shall we?

527
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:24,853
Feeling better?

528
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:26,683
Much. Thank you.

529
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,580
The warm water's actually done me a world of good.

530
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:32,661
You see? The powers of a nice, hot bath.

531
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:35,196
And your Ieg? Any improvement?

532
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:38,930
That is extraordinary.

533
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:43,166
It's the very Ieast I could do. I'm just glad you're feeling better.

534
00:50:43,272 --> 00:50:45,137
You seem happier in yourself, too.

535
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:48,540
I do feel happier. Less troubled.

536
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:50,939
Wonderful.

537
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:54,942
Nothing like a nice soak to warm the cockles of your heart.

538
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:06,258
Now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife,

539
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:09,854
but I've been told I have a healer's hands.

540
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,434
I'd be glad to give you a massage.

541
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,459
What's a massage?

542
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:18,802
Never had... Well, bless my soul.

543
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:23,672
Nothing like a massage to send you off for the finest and deepest night's sleep.

544
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,246
I do have trouble sleeping at night.

545
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:27,212
Lie on your back, dear.

546
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,220
Why not close your eyes?

547
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:35,655
You'll drift off better that way.

548
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:51,063
Hello!

549
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:54,164
Service!

550
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:56,801
Maybe we should carry on and try the next inn,

551
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,642
especially if this stone is as close as your runes say.

552
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,477
I'll give it one more try.

553
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:07,249
Relax here, my Iove.

554
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:10,723
I'll be back just as soon as I've taken care of this customer.

555
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,265
At Iast. We require accommodation.

556
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:21,700
PIease help my friend take the horses to the stables.

557
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:36,810
Hello!

558
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:40,655
Oh.

559
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:58,929
I'm accustomed to better service,

560
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,908
but you're awake now and that's what counts.

561
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:04,109
Prepare your best room.

562
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:05,271
-She got the stone. -Stone, stone.

563
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:09,545
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir. I am the Iady of this inn.

564
00:53:09,652 --> 00:53:11,176
GIass of wine?

565
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:12,481
No, no, no, no, no.

566
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:14,378
No.

567
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:19,384
Until my brother is dead, I have vowed to drink only my own wine.

568
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,022
Though my friend in the stables might be glad of a drop.

569
00:53:27,336 --> 00:53:29,270
Your best room, perhaps?

570
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,204
Of course.

571
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,542
I'm sorry. I presumed that...

572
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:44,085
Traveling alone, are you?

573
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:48,955
I've just stabled my four black stallions and my carriage.

574
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:52,186
Well, I say mine. It belonged to my Iate father.

575
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,403
Thank you.

576
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:11,809
That's so kind, thank you very much. My name's Tristan. What's yours?

577
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,142
Bernard.

578
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:24,084
There was not a horse or beast he could not master.

579
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:26,923
So much so that in his youth, he took to riding a camel,

580
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,394
which was comical.

581
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:30,590
When he passed, the carriage came to me.

582
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:31,723
She's got the stone!

583
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:32,823
-She's got it! -She's got it!

584
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:36,200
And it's the Iargest in all of Stormhold, so they say.

585
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:39,069
How nice for you. If you'll excuse me.

586
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:40,266
Wait.

587
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:42,967
That stone you're wearing. It can't be.

588
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:44,670
-Oh, finally. -Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.

589
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,747
-Well done. -Sweet.

590
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:46,837
Come here. Let me see it.

591
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,886
You have no idea what you're meddling with.

592
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:07,799
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold and I demand that you bring it to me!

593
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,393
Bring me the stone! Now!

594
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:12,633
Prince Primus! Don't touch anything they give you! They tried to...

595
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,921
-Are you all right? -Billy!

596
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:34,221
Get him!

597
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:15,235
The burning golden heart of a star at peace

598
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:18,363
is so much better than your frightened little heart.

599
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:22,410
Even so, better than no heart at all.

600
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:27,109
Yvaine? Hold me tight and think of home.

601
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,952
No!

602
00:56:56,412 --> 00:57:00,815
-What the hell did you do? -What did I do? What did you do?

603
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,817
"Think of home!" That was a great plan!

604
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,978
You thought of your home and I thought of mine

605
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:07,953
and now we're halfway between the two!

606
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:11,116
Oh, you stupid cow! What did you think of your home for?

607
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:12,659
You just said "home"!

608
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:16,094
If you wanted me to think of your home, you should have said!

609
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:18,632
Some crazy Iady was going to cut your heart out

610
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:20,463
and you wanted more specific instructions?

611
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:23,970
Perhaps you'd like it in writing! Or a diagram, maybe!

612
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:36,147
Look, Captain Shakespeare! Caught ourselves a little bonus!

613
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:39,050
A couple of Lightning Marshals!

614
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:45,985
They don't Iook like Lightning Marshals to me.

615
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:49,188
Why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?

616
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:52,495
"Why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?"

617
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:54,363
Well, Iet's think.

618
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,735
Maybe for the same godforsaken reason we are!

619
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,032
Now, who are you?

620
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:05,141
Let's see if a night on our Iovely brig will Ioosen their lips!

621
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:08,182
-Get them in the brig! -You heard the man! Let's go!

622
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:13,050
Get them into the brig and the rest of you dirty dogs, back to work!

623
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:15,749
We've got lightning to catch! Come on!

624
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:43,514
-They're going to kill us, aren't they? -I don't know.

625
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:49,055
You know, it's funny. I used to watch...

626
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:53,189
I used to watch people having adventures.

627
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:56,787
I envied them.

628
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,269
You ever heard the expression, "Be careful what you wish for"?

629
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,066
What? So ending up with my heart cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?

630
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:07,198
No. No, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.

631
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,338
Look, I admire you dreaming.

632
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:14,716
Shop boy like me,

633
00:59:14,816 --> 00:59:16,716
I could never have imagined an adventure this big

634
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:19,082
in order to have wished for it.

635
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:22,389
I just thought I'd find some Iump of celestial rock

636
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:25,085
and take it home, and that would be it.

637
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:26,524
And you got me.

638
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:38,863
If there's one thing I've Iearned in all my years watching Earth,

639
00:59:38,974 --> 00:59:41,772
it's that people aren't what they may seem.

640
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:43,535
There are shop boys

641
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:47,911
and there are boys who just happen to work in shops for the time being.

642
00:59:48,016 --> 00:59:52,009
And trust me, Tristan, you're no shop boy.

643
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:56,918
You saved my life. Thank you.

644
01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:03,489
Well, well, well.

645
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:05,963
The Iast brother dead.

646
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,728
Which means that I'm king.

647
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:15,037
I'm king!

648
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:19,605
Not yet, brother.

649
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:23,077
Damn. I still need the stone.

650
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:28,085
-Your brother doesn't have it? -Well, why don't you find out?

651
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,960
Where is my stone?

652
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:41,797
I don't...

653
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:44,804
The man, see, your brother... I heard him speak of a stone.

654
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:47,807
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.

655
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,809
-What girl? -I don't know.

656
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:52,607
A girl. She got away. Because this was a trap set up for her,

657
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:55,774
but your brother, he come just straight into it.

658
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:58,148
A trap? Set by who?

659
01:00:58,453 --> 01:01:00,353
A woman you should pray you'll never meet.

660
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:01,649
She's...

661
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:05,491
She's gone. She took your brother's carriage.

662
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:07,687
This woman wanted my stone?

663
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:10,196
No. She wanted the girl's heart.

664
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:14,598
She said the girl was a star and she wanted to cut out her heart and...

665
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:18,433
Eat it?

666
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,573
Oh, my God.

667
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:25,705
Do you have any idea what this means?

668
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:28,642
Everlasting life.

669
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:32,009
King forever.

670
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:37,716
It's not here, sire.

671
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:39,919
This idiot's coming with us.

672
01:02:04,352 --> 01:02:06,411
-Ask again. -We have asked again

673
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,819
and the answer is still the same. She is airborne!

674
01:02:08,924 --> 01:02:10,221
Well, she can't remain so forever.

675
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:12,293
Inform me as soon as she touches ground!

676
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,294
Immediately! Do you understand?

677
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:17,957
Watch your tongue, sister! It is you and not we who've Iost her.

678
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,931
Lost her and broken the knife!

679
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:23,004
Even if you apprehend her, how will you complete the deed?

680
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:26,472
Perhaps you should return now and one of us set out in your place.

681
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:27,769
Don't be absurd.

682
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:30,743
I'll bring her home and deal with her there.

683
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:33,713
Be sure everything is ready for our arrival.

684
01:02:40,555 --> 01:02:42,682
Tell me about Victoria then.

685
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:47,955
Well, she...

686
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:54,127
There's nothing more to tell you.

687
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:59,765
Because the little I know about Iove is that it's unconditional.

688
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:02,909
It's not something you can buy.

689
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:05,878
Hang on. This wasn't about me buying her Iove.

690
01:03:07,979 --> 01:03:10,743
This was a way for me to prove how I felt.

691
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:16,487
And what's she doing to prove how she feels about you?

692
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:17,747
Well...

693
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,960
Look, Yvaine, you'll understand when you meet her. All right?

694
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:29,524
Provided we don't get murdered by pirates first.

695
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:35,665
Murdered by pirates. Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.

696
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:38,571
I can't quite decide which sounds more fun.

697
01:03:41,112 --> 01:03:43,342
We've Iocated the sky vessel.

698
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:46,042
It's headed north for the port town on Mount Drummond

699
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:49,483
and you are no Ionger the only one seeking the star.

700
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:51,555
There's someone following your tracks!

701
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:53,749
A witch? A warlock?

702
01:03:53,858 --> 01:03:56,986
A prince and he's catching you up! Get a move on!

703
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:30,792
So, this is the part where you tell me who you are and why you're up here.

704
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:36,829
Or I'll snap her pretty little fingers one by one like dry twigs!

705
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:41,162
My name is Tristan Thorn.

706
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,997
-This is my wife, Yvaine. -Your wife?

707
01:04:44,675 --> 01:04:48,372
Far too young and radiant to belong to just one man!

708
01:04:48,746 --> 01:04:52,614
It's share and share alike aboard my vessel, sonny boy!

709
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:55,141
If you dare even touch her...

710
01:04:55,253 --> 01:04:57,949
You may think you're showing a little spirit in front of your Iady friend,

711
01:04:58,056 --> 01:05:00,889
but if you talk back to me again, I'll feed your tongue to the dogs,

712
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:03,051
you impertinent little pup!

713
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:06,828
-Sir? -Better! But still interrupting.

714
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:10,765
Let's see. A hanging's always good for morale!

715
01:05:10,868 --> 01:05:13,359
Maybe we'll watch you dance a gallows jig!

716
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,399
Or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side and have done with it!

717
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,044
It's a very Iong way down.

718
01:05:22,146 --> 01:05:25,547
PIenty of time to reminisce about your pitifully short lives.

719
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,585
PIease, Iook, we're just trying to make our way home,

720
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:30,017
back to a place called Wall, where I come from.

721
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:31,645
What did you say?

722
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:33,849
I said we were trying to get home to Wall.

723
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,858
That's one lie too many, my son.

724
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,927
-Wall? -Shut up.

725
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:37,995
What's he saying?

726
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:40,997
Thought you could just wander onto my patch, did you?

727
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:42,532
-He is. Yeah, he's gonna... -And live to tell the tale?

728
01:05:42,633 --> 01:05:45,124
All right, go, on the deck, on the deck, on the deck! Now, go, go, go!

729
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:49,673
Big mistake, Mr. Thorn! And the Iast one you'll ever make!

730
01:05:56,948 --> 01:05:59,815
-No! No! You brute! -Come... Come on!

731
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:03,045
-You murderer! You pig! -Come on! Get up! Get up!

732
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:06,753
I'm taking the girl to my cabin, and mark my words,

733
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,587
anyone who disturbs me for the next few hours

734
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:10,558
-will get the same treatment! -What? You'll...

735
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:13,289
No, you idiot! I'll sling you over the side as well!

736
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:14,659
Oh, yeah.

737
01:06:19,003 --> 01:06:21,369
Captain's busy. So should you be.

738
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:24,770
Get in there, wench!

739
01:06:30,848 --> 01:06:33,476
So, that went well, I thought.

740
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,584
Now, tell me news of my beloved England.

741
01:06:38,689 --> 01:06:41,283
I want to hear absolutely everything.

742
01:06:42,593 --> 01:06:45,585
Hang on. I can't believe your crew fell for that.

743
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:48,130
And where in God's name did you get that mannequin from?

744
01:06:48,232 --> 01:06:49,927
Oh, it works every time.

745
01:06:50,034 --> 01:06:52,264
An ounce of bargaining, a pinch of trickery,

746
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,895
a soupcon of intimidation, et voila!

747
01:06:55,006 --> 01:06:57,099
The perfect recipe for a towering reputation

748
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,676
without ever having to spill one drop of blood.

749
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:03,178
Ever try to get blood stains out of a silk shirt? Nightmare.

750
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:06,739
Right. I still don't understand how they won't recognize me.

751
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:07,840
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done,

752
01:07:07,952 --> 01:07:08,919
your own mother won't recognize you.

753
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,009
Now, we've no time to waste.

754
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:11,986
We have only two hours before we make port.

755
01:07:12,089 --> 01:07:13,784
First and foremost...

756
01:07:17,461 --> 01:07:21,056
It'll be so good to see you out of those dreary clothes.

757
01:07:21,165 --> 01:07:24,430
So very small-town errand-boy. Howlingly parochial.

758
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:28,365
Here. Tres you.

759
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:31,668
I wore it as a younger man. I hate to throw anything away.

760
01:07:31,776 --> 01:07:33,368
You know the day you do, it'll come back in fashion,

761
01:07:33,477 --> 01:07:35,377
be oh, so de la mode-

762
01:07:35,479 --> 01:07:36,878
Now, you, darling.

763
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:38,676
I have some Iovely dresses. Take your pick.

764
01:07:38,783 --> 01:07:40,250
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.

765
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:42,717
Honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.

766
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:48,352
Now, England, England. I want to hear everything.

767
01:07:49,093 --> 01:07:51,288
-You're not from England. -Oh, no, sadly, no.

768
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:53,693
But from my earliest youth, I Iapped up the stories.

769
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:55,527
People always told me they were nothing more than folklore,

770
01:07:55,633 --> 01:07:58,124
but my heart told me they were true.

771
01:07:58,236 --> 01:08:00,431
As a boy, I'd scurry away from my father at the market

772
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:03,405
while he did his deals just to peek over the wall,

773
01:08:03,507 --> 01:08:06,499
dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day, seeing England for myself.

774
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:09,011
Really? So you... You were here Iooking over there.

775
01:08:09,113 --> 01:08:10,341
Oh, yes.

776
01:08:11,882 --> 01:08:14,248
-Hair. -Hair?

777
01:08:15,453 --> 01:08:17,751
Mind you, I did my best to fit in.

778
01:08:17,855 --> 01:08:20,119
Tried to make my father, Captain Ghostmaker, proud.

779
01:08:20,224 --> 01:08:22,624
Forged a decent reputation as a ruthless marauder

780
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:24,695
and cold-blooded killer.

781
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:26,825
But my father died.

782
01:08:27,632 --> 01:08:29,827
I always promised him I'd take over the family business,

783
01:08:29,934 --> 01:08:31,902
keep the old girl flying.

784
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:34,837
You have no idea the lightness it brings to my heart

785
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:37,965
being able to confide in you charming young people.

786
01:08:38,075 --> 01:08:40,407
The pressure of maintaining the whole Captain Shakespeare persona

787
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:42,502
for the sake of the crew, I don't know.

788
01:08:42,613 --> 01:08:44,137
Sometimes...

789
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:47,217
You see, I'm very much a man of my own creation.

790
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:50,185
Even chose the name specially. Took me ages.

791
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:52,381
See, I'm thinking Iegendary British wordsmith.

792
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:55,516
My enemies and crew are thinking, "Shake! Spear!"

793
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,321
It's little things like that make me happy.

794
01:08:58,663 --> 01:09:00,722
I don't understand that.

795
01:09:00,831 --> 01:09:03,629
Surely it would make you happier just to be yourself.

796
01:09:03,734 --> 01:09:07,033
Why fight to be accepted by people you don't actually want to be like?

797
01:09:07,138 --> 01:09:10,164
Yeah. Why would anyone do that to himself?

798
01:09:11,475 --> 01:09:12,703
Exactly.

799
01:09:15,813 --> 01:09:19,647
Port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!

800
01:09:33,431 --> 01:09:34,693
Hurry up.

801
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:46,642
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh. I'll be honest.

802
01:09:46,744 --> 01:09:48,769
Shall I give you a little taste, young Ferdinand?

803
01:09:48,879 --> 01:09:50,642
No, no. Oh, there you go.

804
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,979
Brilliant. Like they're cheap.

805
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:59,022
I think it's still crackling, very much alive, still tres fresh.

806
01:09:59,323 --> 01:10:01,917
-So, name your best price. -For 10,000 bolts?

807
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:04,460
Ten thousand bolts of finest quality grade A.

808
01:10:04,562 --> 01:10:07,429
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift, isn't it? Difficult to store.

809
01:10:07,531 --> 01:10:10,762
If I get the Revenue Men in here sniffing round, what's the...

810
01:10:10,868 --> 01:10:12,631
Best price, 150 guineas.

811
01:10:12,737 --> 01:10:13,204
Gentlemen, put the merchandise back onboard and prepare to sail.

812
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:15,069
Gentlemen, put the merchandise back onboard and prepare to sail.

813
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:16,469
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Ferdinand, always a pleasure.

814
01:10:16,607 --> 01:10:18,336
Hold on. Hold on. One minute. Hold on, cuddles.

815
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:20,307
-Oh, he's... -One-sixty. One-sixty.

816
01:10:20,411 --> 01:10:22,345
Seeing as I'm feeling particularly generous today,

817
01:10:22,446 --> 01:10:23,708
I'll settle for 200.

818
01:10:23,814 --> 01:10:26,840
Two hundred? Okay. You're having a Iaugh.

819
01:10:26,951 --> 01:10:28,213
Have you had your head in that?

820
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,379
Has he been sailing up where the air's too thin?

821
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:35,484
-You're being very rude. -Not anymore.

822
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,423
-Two hundred. -One-eighty.

823
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:39,962
-Two hundred. -That's not negotiation.

824
01:10:40,064 --> 01:10:42,362
I'm changing my number. One-eight-five.

825
01:10:42,466 --> 01:10:44,900
-Did I hear 200? -From you, you did. Yeah.

826
01:10:45,002 --> 01:10:47,800
-You said 200. -If I did, you're a ventriloquist.

827
01:10:47,905 --> 01:10:49,964
Okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.

828
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:54,402
One-nine-five it is. So, with sales tax, that's, Iet's see, 200.

829
01:10:54,512 --> 01:10:56,707
Brilliant. Put it in the back.

830
01:10:57,114 --> 01:10:59,275
Unbelievable. Here.

831
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:06,484
Yes? Can I help you?

832
01:11:08,526 --> 01:11:09,618
Nosy.

833
01:11:10,094 --> 01:11:13,325
Have you heard any of these rumors going round about a fallen star?

834
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:14,830
Everyone's talking about it.

835
01:11:14,932 --> 01:11:18,231
You get your hands on one of them, we can shut up shop. Retire.

836
01:11:18,335 --> 01:11:20,030
-Fallen star? -Yeah.

837
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:27,771
-Nothing on your travels? -No.

838
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:29,106
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?

839
01:11:29,213 --> 01:11:30,908
Everyone's going on about it down at the market.

840
01:11:31,015 --> 01:11:32,277
Which market? The market near the wall?

841
01:11:32,383 --> 01:11:33,350
Yeah.

842
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:35,214
Well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time listening to gossip

843
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:37,253
from the kind of pond scum trading down there.

844
01:11:37,354 --> 01:11:39,686
-Well, if it... -Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.

845
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:41,519
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?

846
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,923
Oh, what a wonderful woman you are, Sal.

847
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:45,723
How the world wouldn't be the same place without you.

848
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:47,491
You Iook great. You've had your feet done, haven't you?

849
01:11:47,598 --> 01:11:51,694
But, you two, you have business to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.

850
01:11:51,802 --> 01:11:54,498
Come on. I've got something new for you.

851
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:02,907
Captain Shakespeare.

852
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:04,611
Stand down!

853
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,410
Meet my nephew, the fearsome buccaneer,

854
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:08,007
Tristan Thorn.

855
01:12:08,352 --> 01:12:10,877
He'll be joining us for our journey home.

856
01:12:10,988 --> 01:12:14,389
I have the perfect gift to keep you amused on the way.

857
01:12:21,265 --> 01:12:22,289
Oh...

858
01:12:28,606 --> 01:12:30,073
Right, you Iazy dogs!

859
01:12:30,174 --> 01:12:32,836
Let's get young Tristan on his way home!

860
01:14:25,055 --> 01:14:26,249
Touche.

861
01:14:26,924 --> 01:14:28,414
I'm impressed.

862
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:46,468
Yvaine, I know what you are.

863
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:51,804
No, no. Have no fear.

864
01:14:52,316 --> 01:14:56,480
No one on this vessel will harm you, but there are plenty who would.

865
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:03,621
Your emotions give you away, Yvaine. You must Iearn to control them.

866
01:15:03,727 --> 01:15:06,025
You've been glowing more brightly every day,

867
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,563
and I think you know why.

868
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:10,429
Of course I know why I'm glowing. I'm a star.

869
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:14,560
-And what do stars do best? -Well, it's certainly not the waltz.

870
01:15:25,749 --> 01:15:27,011
-Now try. -Okay.

871
01:15:30,487 --> 01:15:32,216
-See? -Very good.

872
01:15:47,504 --> 01:15:48,903
Due west, you say?

873
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:50,337
And you're certain he had a girl with him?

874
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:51,430
Yeah.

875
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:54,841
You're sure? Absolutely sure? Sure you're not Iying?

876
01:15:55,345 --> 01:15:57,643
I'd cross my heart if I had one.

877
01:15:58,982 --> 01:16:00,609
-Brilliant. -You'd better be telling the truth,

878
01:16:00,718 --> 01:16:01,980
you two-faced dog.

879
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:05,055
I can get you one of them, actually. Very good guard dogs.

880
01:16:05,155 --> 01:16:07,316
They can watch the back and the front door at the same time.

881
01:16:07,424 --> 01:16:08,391
I can get you anything you want.

882
01:16:08,492 --> 01:16:11,154
What are the chances of getting a Babylon candle?

883
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:12,694
That one's slim.

884
01:16:12,796 --> 01:16:17,256
AIthough, I did know a girl once, if you know what I mean...

885
01:16:17,367 --> 01:16:18,459
I'm a Iadies' man.

886
01:16:18,569 --> 01:16:19,968
...who had a sister...

887
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,128
I think it was a woman.

888
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:24,969
Oh, she was terrible. Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.

889
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:26,269
Enough.

890
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,290
Hold on tight! The Captain's at the helm!

891
01:17:38,816 --> 01:17:41,546
So there's the road you'll need for Wall.

892
01:17:41,652 --> 01:17:45,144
Good Iuck on your journey home, Yvaine, wherever that may be.

893
01:17:45,255 --> 01:17:48,224
And good Iuck to you, Tristan, with your Victoria.

894
01:17:48,992 --> 01:17:50,823
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough for your kindness?

895
01:17:50,928 --> 01:17:54,523
Don't mention it. No, seriously, don't mention it.

896
01:17:54,631 --> 01:17:58,658
Reputations, you know. A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.

897
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:04,006
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...

898
01:18:07,177 --> 01:18:08,940
Just think about it.

899
01:18:12,749 --> 01:18:17,118
Well, give my regards to England. It's been a pleasure to meet you both.

900
01:18:20,591 --> 01:18:23,856
Mind you don't wear that wench out, Captain Tristan!

901
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:30,465
What did he say to you?

902
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:32,629
What did he say when?

903
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:35,227
Just then. When he whispered to you.

904
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,140
No... No, he... He was just saying we should use the lightning

905
01:18:39,243 --> 01:18:41,473
to get you a Babylon candle.

906
01:18:41,578 --> 01:18:43,512
Barter for it, you know.

907
01:18:44,715 --> 01:18:48,276
For the Iast time, where is the girl?

908
01:18:49,653 --> 01:18:52,417
The girl with the stone! Where did she go?

909
01:18:53,523 --> 01:18:55,650
-Are you mocking me? -No...

910
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:59,251
'Cause if you are, believe me, you have seconds to live!

911
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:05,667
What a freak.

912
01:19:06,003 --> 01:19:08,528
CIean this thoroughly.

913
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,044
Bollocks.

914
01:19:20,317 --> 01:19:23,013
If you have quite finished squandering your magic

915
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,611
on your rather counterproductive beauty routine,

916
01:19:25,722 --> 01:19:27,986
you might like to know that the star has returned.

917
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:29,456
She's back on Iand.

918
01:19:29,559 --> 01:19:32,926
I know, damn it. I couldn't reach the Iake in time.

919
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:37,399
No matter. We have found her. She is on the road to the village of Wall.

920
01:19:37,501 --> 01:19:40,026
If you take the shortcut across the marshes,

921
01:19:40,137 --> 01:19:42,002
you should arrive in time to intercept her.

922
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:52,209
Yvaine.

923
01:19:56,053 --> 01:19:58,146
-Are you trying to break my Ieg again? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

924
01:19:58,255 --> 01:20:01,190
I just... I can't risk people seeing you. I don't trust anyone.

925
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,952
But at this rate, if we keep stopping...

926
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:08,020
Yvaine. We're making good time. Just Ieave it a minute.

927
01:20:15,005 --> 01:20:16,734
Aren't you tempted?

928
01:20:19,843 --> 01:20:21,572
Tempted? By what?

929
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,779
Immortality.

930
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:27,681
Let's say it wasn't my heart.

931
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:31,550
Not me. Just a star you didn't know.

932
01:20:33,256 --> 01:20:35,952
You seriously think I could kill anyone?

933
01:20:40,063 --> 01:20:44,432
I mean, even if I could... Everlasting life?

934
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:49,130
I imagine it would be kind of Ionely.

935
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,467
Well,

936
01:20:54,277 --> 01:20:57,041
maybe if you had someone to share it with.

937
01:20:58,215 --> 01:20:59,807
Someone you Iove.

938
01:21:00,217 --> 01:21:02,617
Maybe then it might be different.

939
01:21:05,822 --> 01:21:07,949
Come on, I think we're safe.

940
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,777
Now remember, Captain Shakespeare has a fearsome reputation.

941
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:04,632
-What the hell is this? -What are you doing here?

942
01:23:04,741 --> 01:23:06,834
My name is Prince Septimus.

943
01:23:08,078 --> 01:23:10,842
And you're going to tell me where I can find the girl.

944
01:23:18,155 --> 01:23:23,559
All right, twinkletoes. I'm gonna count to three. One, two...

945
01:23:39,805 --> 01:23:44,469
You know, you sort of glitter sometimes. I just noticed it. Is it normal?

946
01:23:44,576 --> 01:23:47,670
Let's see if you can work it out for yourself.

947
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:49,576
What do stars do?

948
01:23:51,149 --> 01:23:52,776
Attract trouble?

949
01:23:54,886 --> 01:23:57,184
That's... All right, I'm sorry. Wait, I'm sorry.

950
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:58,847
All right, Iet me... Let me... Do I get another guess?

951
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:04,052
Is it... Do they know exactly how to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?

952
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:11,598
-How Iong will that take? -Maybe two days.

953
01:24:11,703 --> 01:24:15,434
But we don't have two days. Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.

954
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:19,302
Yes, it is. Well remembered.

955
01:24:25,817 --> 01:24:28,479
-Nice cup of Earl Grey. -Get out, everybody. Get out.

956
01:24:28,587 --> 01:24:30,555
Did he hurt you, Captain?

957
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:35,590
Did you tell him where your nephew and the girl went?

958
01:24:36,661 --> 01:24:38,492
So what's the problem?

959
01:24:39,764 --> 01:24:41,459
It's my reputation.

960
01:24:42,968 --> 01:24:45,232
No. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.

961
01:24:45,337 --> 01:24:47,168
It's all right, Captain.

962
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:50,374
We always knew you were a whoopsie.

963
01:24:53,678 --> 01:24:57,375
-You'll always be our captain, Captain. -Aye, aye, Captain.

964
01:25:02,854 --> 01:25:03,821
Captain.

965
01:25:03,922 --> 01:25:05,913
Yeah. Let's go, Iet's go.

966
01:25:13,098 --> 01:25:14,963
Prince Septimus, your men, they're dead.

967
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,431
Oh, really?

968
01:25:18,336 --> 01:25:19,496
Go on!

969
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:35,484
I met that woman. She's friends with the Captain.

970
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:37,282
He said she trades at the market near Wall.

971
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:39,380
-We could hitch a lift. -Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?

972
01:25:39,491 --> 01:25:40,719
-You sure? -Yes, yes.

973
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:45,359
Wait! Sorry! My name is Tristan Thorn. This...

974
01:25:45,463 --> 01:25:47,090
That's my flower.

975
01:25:47,832 --> 01:25:50,892
Eighteen years I've been Iooking for that.

976
01:25:51,002 --> 01:25:52,629
Give it to me now!

977
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:56,431
How dare you? That was a gift from his mother!

978
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:57,508
Oh.

979
01:25:58,076 --> 01:25:59,941
Perhaps I was mistaken.

980
01:26:01,246 --> 01:26:02,770
It's all right.

981
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:05,408
It's obviously very valuable to you, so you can have it

982
01:26:05,517 --> 01:26:07,041
in exchange for what I need.

983
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:09,211
-A Babylon candle? -And safe passage to the wall.

984
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:11,152
A Babylon candle?

985
01:26:11,256 --> 01:26:15,192
Oh, no, no, no. I don't deal in black magic.

986
01:26:15,293 --> 01:26:16,487
Really?

987
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:19,596
Well, can you give us a lift then? To the wall?

988
01:26:19,698 --> 01:26:22,724
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?

989
01:26:24,769 --> 01:26:27,533
For that flower, I can offer you passage.

990
01:26:27,806 --> 01:26:29,967
-Food and Iodging on the way? -Safe passage.

991
01:26:30,075 --> 01:26:32,407
I swear that you will arrive at the wall

992
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:35,570
in the exact same condition that you're in now.

993
01:26:41,186 --> 01:26:43,780
Do you have any idea what manner of thing it was that you had?

994
01:26:43,888 --> 01:26:45,879
Some kind of Iucky charm?

995
01:26:46,358 --> 01:26:49,589
A very Iucky charm indeed. Protection.

996
01:26:50,428 --> 01:26:55,195
In fact, the exact same thing that would've prevented me from doing this.

997
01:26:59,604 --> 01:27:02,300
-Oh, my God! What did you do? -Much better.

998
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:06,207
You shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it-

999
01:27:06,578 --> 01:27:10,105
Though I'll keep me word. You shall not be harmed.

1000
01:27:19,057 --> 01:27:22,652
There. Food and Iodging just as I promised.

1001
01:27:22,761 --> 01:27:26,891
Would I be correct in thinking that you can neither see nor hear me?

1002
01:27:27,332 --> 01:27:30,028
Then I'd like to tell you that you smell of pee.

1003
01:27:30,135 --> 01:27:31,898
You Iook like the wrong end of a dog.

1004
01:27:32,003 --> 01:27:34,471
And I swear, if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,

1005
01:27:34,572 --> 01:27:36,733
I'll be your personal poltergeist!

1006
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,154
Tristan?

1007
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:01,528
If you can understand me, Iook at me now.

1008
01:28:30,061 --> 01:28:33,053
You know when I said I knew little about Iove?

1009
01:28:34,799 --> 01:28:36,699
Well, that wasn't true.

1010
01:28:39,237 --> 01:28:41,171
I know a Iot about Iove.

1011
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:45,376
I've seen it. I've seen centuries and centuries of it.

1012
01:28:47,178 --> 01:28:51,137
And it was the only thing that made watching your world bearable.

1013
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:57,811
All those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.

1014
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:03,257
Made me want to turn away and never Iook down again.

1015
01:29:05,397 --> 01:29:09,197
But to see the way that mankind Ioves.

1016
01:29:10,402 --> 01:29:13,132
I mean, you could search the furthest reaches of the universe

1017
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:16,071
and never find anything more beautiful.

1018
01:29:18,977 --> 01:29:24,381
So, yes, I know that Iove is unconditional.

1019
01:29:26,017 --> 01:29:29,817
But I also know it can be unpredictable,

1020
01:29:30,789 --> 01:29:36,421
unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable

1021
01:29:38,396 --> 01:29:42,492
and, well, strangely easy to mistake for Ioathing.

1022
01:29:43,268 --> 01:29:44,235
And

1023
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:51,007
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is

1024
01:29:52,677 --> 01:29:54,406
I think I Iove you.

1025
01:29:55,513 --> 01:30:01,213
My heart, it feels like my chest can barely contain it.

1026
01:30:03,054 --> 01:30:08,492
Like it doesn't belong to me anymore. It belongs to you.

1027
01:30:10,028 --> 01:30:14,260
And if you wanted it, I'd wish for nothing in exchange.

1028
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:20,527
No gifts, no goods, no demonstrations of devotion.

1029
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:26,169
Nothing but knowing you Iove me, too.

1030
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:29,636
Just your heart

1031
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:33,411
in exchange for mine.

1032
01:30:42,894 --> 01:30:45,089
The wall is one mile that way.

1033
01:30:45,897 --> 01:30:49,594
There. Though the walk might take you a little Ionger than normal.

1034
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:53,797
Transformation tends to Ieave the brain a bit scrambled for a while.

1035
01:30:57,275 --> 01:30:58,606
You...

1036
01:30:58,843 --> 01:30:59,832
Oh!

1037
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:03,445
I warned you. Save your strength.

1038
01:31:04,415 --> 01:31:06,679
I've been so worried about you.

1039
01:31:07,352 --> 01:31:08,580
Victoria.

1040
01:31:09,621 --> 01:31:11,680
I think I preferred "Mother."

1041
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:18,153
Come on. There's an inn over there. Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.

1042
01:31:19,197 --> 01:31:20,664
I think you need a bath and a good night's sleep

1043
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:23,029
before you present me to her.

1044
01:31:23,134 --> 01:31:24,761
Come on. Come.

1045
01:31:27,138 --> 01:31:30,039
-Come on, Tristan. It's not that far. -Okay.

1046
01:31:51,563 --> 01:31:53,258
-Excuse me? -Oh!

1047
01:31:53,364 --> 01:31:56,595
-I think you're in my bath. -Well, close your eyes!

1048
01:31:58,136 --> 01:32:02,266
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not Iooking. Here, I'll turn away.

1049
01:32:07,245 --> 01:32:09,611
All right, you can open them now.

1050
01:32:17,355 --> 01:32:20,483
Did you really mean what you said in the caravan?

1051
01:32:22,527 --> 01:32:23,789
What I...

1052
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:26,921
But... But you were a mouse!

1053
01:32:27,365 --> 01:32:30,528
You were a mouse! You wanted cheese! You didn't...

1054
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:32,466
I asked you to give me a sign.

1055
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:36,734
And risk you being too embarrassed to keep saying such Iovely things?

1056
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:45,641
You want to know what the Captain really whispered to me that day?

1057
01:32:47,986 --> 01:32:52,582
He told me that my true Iove was right in front of my eyes.

1058
01:32:54,792 --> 01:32:56,419
And he was right.

1059
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:14,110
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on, you got to come up and see this!

1060
01:33:14,212 --> 01:33:15,645
No, thank you.

1061
01:33:16,381 --> 01:33:18,440
-Pervert! -Suit yourself.

1062
01:33:20,418 --> 01:33:23,819
-Ironic, isn't it? -Yeah. What is?

1063
01:33:24,455 --> 01:33:26,514
Septimus will be here by the morning,

1064
01:33:26,624 --> 01:33:30,390
find the girl, get the stone and be king forever.

1065
01:33:30,495 --> 01:33:31,826
So unjust.

1066
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,728
Still, at Ieast we will be free.

1067
01:33:37,502 --> 01:33:40,835
You're very close. She's in the market town.

1068
01:33:40,938 --> 01:33:43,236
One mile from the gap in the wall.

1069
01:33:43,341 --> 01:33:45,400
You speak as if this is good news.

1070
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:49,446
Do I need to remind you that Wall is not part of our universe?

1071
01:33:49,547 --> 01:33:52,107
If she crosses the threshold into the human realm,

1072
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:56,243
our star becomes nothing more than a pitted Iump of metallic rock.

1073
01:33:56,754 --> 01:33:59,154
Then I suggest you hurry up!

1074
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:31,481
What?

1075
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:33,650
Oh, what do you want?

1076
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:36,886
Sorry. Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

1077
01:34:36,994 --> 01:34:39,861
Ask me again at a more reasonable hour.

1078
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:41,056
No, I can't. I have to go.

1079
01:34:41,165 --> 01:34:43,395
Look, if my friend wakes up before I get back,

1080
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:45,969
-please, can you give her a message? -Go on.

1081
01:35:22,573 --> 01:35:26,202
You know, that's the first time I've ever slept at night.

1082
01:35:27,545 --> 01:35:29,240
I can't believe it.

1083
01:35:33,618 --> 01:35:34,607
Tristan?

1084
01:35:43,895 --> 01:35:45,658
Have you seen my friend?

1085
01:35:45,763 --> 01:35:47,663
He Ieft absurdly early.

1086
01:35:48,866 --> 01:35:50,094
He Ieft?

1087
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:53,432
He told me to tell you he's gone to see Victoria

1088
01:35:53,538 --> 01:35:56,439
because he's sorry, but he's found his true Iove

1089
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:59,669
and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.

1090
01:36:00,745 --> 01:36:01,837
What?

1091
01:36:02,847 --> 01:36:05,315
-Are you sure? -I'm positive.

1092
01:36:34,745 --> 01:36:37,612
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

1093
01:37:21,225 --> 01:37:22,715
Happy birthday.

1094
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:24,991
Tristan.

1095
01:37:26,964 --> 01:37:28,727
What happened to you?

1096
01:37:30,134 --> 01:37:31,761
I found the star.

1097
01:37:33,905 --> 01:37:35,805
I can't believe you did it.

1098
01:37:35,907 --> 01:37:38,375
Where's my star? Can I see it?

1099
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:41,535
-Is it beautiful? -Yes.

1100
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:45,749
Well, it's awfully small.

1101
01:37:46,717 --> 01:37:49,743
Well, that's just a little piece. A token for your birthday.

1102
01:37:49,854 --> 01:37:52,652
Well... Well, then forget about the star.

1103
01:37:53,958 --> 01:37:56,153
It's not the star that I want.

1104
01:37:58,596 --> 01:38:00,359
You know what I want.

1105
01:38:02,566 --> 01:38:04,397
Yeah. I do.

1106
01:38:09,674 --> 01:38:13,610
You want to grow up and get over yourself.

1107
01:38:18,416 --> 01:38:20,043
-Humphrey. -Thorn.

1108
01:38:20,584 --> 01:38:22,677
You must have a death wish.

1109
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:33,493
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.

1110
01:38:34,131 --> 01:38:35,792
She's all yours.

1111
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,460
You really are a perfect couple. The best of Iuck to you both.

1112
01:38:38,569 --> 01:38:43,199
Well, why would I want this? It's just a measly handful of stardust!

1113
01:38:48,746 --> 01:38:49,872
Yvaine?

1114
01:38:52,016 --> 01:38:53,950
She can't cross the wall.

1115
01:39:02,693 --> 01:39:03,717
Go on!

1116
01:40:11,228 --> 01:40:14,163
Stop! Stop! If you go through there, you'll die!

1117
01:40:14,265 --> 01:40:15,323
What?

1118
01:40:17,501 --> 01:40:20,698
If you set foot on human soil, you'll turn to rock.

1119
01:40:21,272 --> 01:40:24,764
Wretched slattern! Where have you taken me?

1120
01:40:34,118 --> 01:40:36,609
PIanning to enter Wall, were you?

1121
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:41,123
If death is what you wish, my dear, I'd be more than happy to assist you.

1122
01:40:41,459 --> 01:40:43,359
Are you talking to me?

1123
01:40:44,095 --> 01:40:45,722
You. Small world.

1124
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:50,063
Anyhow, no, I wasn't. I was talking to the star.

1125
01:40:50,568 --> 01:40:51,865
What star?

1126
01:40:53,404 --> 01:40:57,101
My slave girl's no star. Any fool can see that.

1127
01:40:57,641 --> 01:41:00,269
If she was, I'd have had the heart out of her chest

1128
01:41:00,377 --> 01:41:02,902
a Iong time ago, trust me.

1129
01:41:03,314 --> 01:41:06,715
Trust you? Not a mistake I'd be likely to make again.

1130
01:41:07,384 --> 01:41:10,785
What's it to be, Ditchwater Sal? Heads or tails?

1131
01:41:40,818 --> 01:41:44,879
-Oh, God. Time to go. -She's not going anywhere.

1132
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:46,887
I think you'll find she is.

1133
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:49,357
It's all right. You can come, too.

1134
01:41:52,263 --> 01:41:56,324
You can ride in the carriage or be dragged behind it. Your choice.

1135
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,517
What happened?

1136
01:42:17,621 --> 01:42:19,953
Be my guest. I quit.

1137
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:23,049
Eighty years I've stopped you people going out.

1138
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:25,025
What I should have been worrying about

1139
01:42:25,129 --> 01:42:26,619
was those people from the other side coming in.

1140
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:28,391
All right, just tell me what happened!

1141
01:42:28,499 --> 01:42:30,364
What happened? Oh, where to start?

1142
01:42:31,735 --> 01:42:32,702
No!

1143
01:42:46,717 --> 01:42:47,911
Come on!

1144
01:43:17,815 --> 01:43:18,941
Go on!

1145
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:50,808
The star!

1146
01:43:51,415 --> 01:43:52,382
And who else?

1147
01:43:52,483 --> 01:43:55,611
A slave for us. It will be nice to have someone to help mop up

1148
01:43:55,719 --> 01:43:57,914
when we've finished with our little guest.

1149
01:43:58,022 --> 01:43:59,421
Oh, good work, sister.

1150
01:43:59,523 --> 01:44:02,424
And just in time, I see! You Iook awful!

1151
01:45:01,452 --> 01:45:02,851
Who are you?

1152
01:45:04,154 --> 01:45:06,452
What business do you have here?

1153
01:45:07,891 --> 01:45:09,153
Septimus?

1154
01:45:09,693 --> 01:45:11,786
I knew your brother, Primus.

1155
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:15,655
Unless you wish to meet him in the afterlife,

1156
01:45:15,766 --> 01:45:18,428
I suggest you answer my question. What are you doing here?

1157
01:45:18,535 --> 01:45:20,833
I might ask you the same thing.

1158
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:39,453
There are four of them.

1159
01:45:42,426 --> 01:45:45,156
Do as I say and we may stand a chance.

1160
01:45:45,262 --> 01:45:47,753
Wait. How do I know you can be trusted?

1161
01:45:47,865 --> 01:45:50,459
You don't. Why? Do you have a choice?

1162
01:45:50,567 --> 01:45:52,558
-No. -Well, then, Iet's go.

1163
01:45:59,977 --> 01:46:03,572
Get off me! Get off!

1164
01:46:07,818 --> 01:46:10,013
-Una? -Septimus.

1165
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,587
-Una! -Sister!

1166
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:32,205
Tristan! No! Tristan!

1167
01:46:33,444 --> 01:46:36,140
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.

1168
01:46:37,381 --> 01:46:38,939
I'm your mother.

1169
01:47:15,652 --> 01:47:18,246
-Rather well. -Good riddance to you. Yes.

1170
01:47:43,847 --> 01:47:44,814
Oh!

1171
01:47:57,861 --> 01:48:00,056
Let's put out those flames.

1172
01:48:00,497 --> 01:48:01,794
Shall we?

1173
01:48:52,516 --> 01:48:54,381
So, what happens now?

1174
01:48:55,185 --> 01:48:57,585
We have to Iearn to live with each other.

1175
01:48:57,688 --> 01:48:58,882
Forever?

1176
01:49:04,394 --> 01:49:06,157
Let's get on with it.

1177
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:12,091
Be the man that I know you are.

1178
01:49:29,886 --> 01:49:31,183
-Get outside. -Okay.

1179
01:49:31,288 --> 01:49:32,277
Go.

1180
01:49:42,466 --> 01:49:44,331
-Tristan! -Get him.

1181
01:50:20,003 --> 01:50:21,265
Get off!

1182
01:50:25,409 --> 01:50:27,138
Get out!

1183
01:51:04,314 --> 01:51:08,774
So, what's it to be, Prince Charming? Frog or tadpole?

1184
01:52:06,843 --> 01:52:08,071
Septimus?

1185
01:53:30,193 --> 01:53:31,353
Tristan!

1186
01:54:15,171 --> 01:54:16,468
Youth.

1187
01:54:17,407 --> 01:54:18,704
Beauty.

1188
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,944
It all seems meaningless now.

1189
01:54:23,647 --> 01:54:25,615
My sisters are dead!

1190
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:30,913
Everything I cared about gone.

1191
01:54:37,093 --> 01:54:38,185
Go.

1192
01:54:43,667 --> 01:54:44,964
Go!

1193
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:06,956
No!

1194
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,014
I owe you thanks, boy.

1195
01:56:06,449 --> 01:56:09,543
What use was her heart to me when it was broken?

1196
01:56:09,986 --> 01:56:14,889
And you got rid of my sisters and now I can have it all for myself.

1197
01:56:20,764 --> 01:56:23,790
-Hold me tight and close your eyes. -What? Why?

1198
01:56:24,567 --> 01:56:26,194
What do stars do?

1199
01:56:33,009 --> 01:56:34,169
Shine.

1200
01:57:10,413 --> 01:57:12,074
-Bravo! -Yeah!

1201
01:57:12,482 --> 01:57:13,779
Very good.

1202
01:57:15,552 --> 01:57:17,076
Why didn't you do that earlier?

1203
01:57:17,187 --> 01:57:21,817
I couldn't have done that without you. No star can shine with a broken heart.

1204
01:57:23,226 --> 01:57:25,091
I thought I'd Iost you.

1205
01:57:26,362 --> 01:57:28,159
But you came back.

1206
01:57:28,565 --> 01:57:30,863
Of course I did. I Iove you.

1207
01:57:36,439 --> 01:57:37,667
Come on.

1208
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,057
Tristan.

1209
01:58:01,798 --> 01:58:05,290
The Iast surviving male heir of the Stormhold bloodline.

1210
01:58:08,071 --> 01:58:09,698
It's you, Tristan.

1211
01:58:13,576 --> 01:58:16,568
But if he's the new King of Stormhold, then...

1212
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:08,154
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.

1213
01:59:25,548 --> 01:59:26,947
Yeah!

1214
01:59:42,865 --> 01:59:44,492
My gift to you.

1215
01:59:46,302 --> 01:59:47,701
To you both.

1216
01:59:48,004 --> 01:59:49,335
Thank you.

1217
02:00:04,287 --> 02:00:06,847
They ruled for 80 years-

1218
02:00:08,091 --> 02:00:11,026
But no man can live forever,

1219
02:00:11,928 --> 02:00:15,329
except he who possesses the heart of a star-

1220
02:00:16,232 --> 02:00:20,635
And Yvaine had given hers to Tristan completely-

1221
02:00:22,205 --> 02:00:25,504
When their children and grandchildren were grown,

1222
02:00:26,542 --> 02:00:29,773
it was time to light the Babylon candle-

1223
02:00:35,852 --> 02:00:40,289
And they still live happily ever after-
