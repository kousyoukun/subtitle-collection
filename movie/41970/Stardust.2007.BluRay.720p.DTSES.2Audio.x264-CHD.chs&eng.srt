00:00:39,638 --> 00:00:41,970
一位哲人曾经问：
Aphilosopher once asked,

2
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:46,568
“我们之所以是人类，是因为我们可以仰望繁星”
"Are we human because we gaze at the stars,

3
00:00:46,678 --> 00:00:50,409
“还是因为我们是人类，所以才仰望星空呢？”
"or do we gaze at them because we are human?"

4
00:00:51,283 --> 00:00:52,910
毫无意义，真的
Pointless, really-

5
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:55,879
星星们也会注视着我们么？
Do the stars gaze back?

6
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:58,753
现在，便成了个问题
Now, that's a question-

7
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,559
但我好像说得早了点
But I'm getting ahead of myself-

8
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,824
我们的故事真正从这里开始
Our story really begins here,

9
00:01:05,931 --> 00:01:09,560
150年前的皇家科学院
1 50 years ago at the Royal Academy of Science

10
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:11,966
英国，伦敦
in London, England,

11
00:01:12,905 --> 00:01:17,808
一封信被寄到了那，信中问了个奇怪的问题
where a letter arrived, containing a very strange inquiry-

12
00:01:19,178 --> 00:01:21,908
提问的是个来自乡下的男孩
It had come from a country boy

13
00:01:22,014 --> 00:01:24,079
读信的那位学者觉得
and the scientist who read it thought it might be a practical joke of some kind-

14
00:01:24,094 --> 00:01:27,179
这可能是个男孩小小的恶作剧

15
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:29,914
但他还是按时写了回信
But he duly wrote a reply

16
00:01:30,022 --> 00:01:33,985
礼貌地表明…那个怀疑只是男孩胡乱的猜测
politely explaining that the query was nonsense-

17
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:39,258
信被邮到了男孩那儿，一个叫墙的村子
And posted it to the boy who lived in a village called Wall,

18
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:41,460
男孩说，村子之所以叫这个名字
so named, the boy had said, for the wall that ran alongside it-

19
00:01:41,464 --> 00:01:43,560
是因为在村子的旁边有一堵墙

20
00:01:43,569 --> 00:01:45,930
当地流传着一个传说
A wall that, according to local folklore, hid an extraordinary secret-

21
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:49,530
这堵墙隐藏着一个特别的秘密

22
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:54,101
我的责任就是，守卫这个通向另一个世界的入口
I'm charged with guarding the portal to another world.

23
00:01:54,213 --> 00:01:58,650
而你居然告诉我，你要让我允许你从这通过？
And you're asking me to just Iet you through?

24
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,652
是啊，说实话，那就是个旷野
Yes. Because, Iet's be honest, it's a field.

25
00:02:02,754 --> 00:02:06,121
看，你看见另一个世界了么？
Look, do you see another world out there?

26
00:02:06,225 --> 00:02:08,201
没，你看到的是旷野
No. You see a field. Do you see anything nonhuman?

27
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,821
你看到任何非人类的东西了么？

28
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:14,421
不，知道为什么么？因为那只是个旷野！
No. And you know why? Because it's a field!

29
00:02:14,533 --> 00:02:17,764
几百年来，这墙就一直在这
Hundreds of years, this wall's been here.

30
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,637
几百年来，这条沟壑24小时有人看守
Hundreds of years, this gap's been under 24-hour guard.

31
00:02:22,741 --> 00:02:25,574
好吧…　　再敢多说一句
-Well... -One more word,

32
00:02:25,677 --> 00:02:29,636
我就把你拿到乡村委员会去
and I'll have you up in front of the village council!

33
00:02:31,183 --> 00:02:34,448
看来我们没什么好商量的了　　　是的
-Well, that sounds rather final. -Yeah.

34
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,882
我想我最好还是回家去吧
-Better just go home, then, I suppose. -Right, then. Night, Dunstan.

35
00:02:37,888 --> 00:02:40,882
这就对了，那么晚安，邓斯坦

36
00:02:41,727 --> 00:02:43,854
替我向你爸爸问好
Give my best to your father.

37
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:47,157
站住！
Stop!

38
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:50,693
站住！
Stop!

39
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,841
我可不喜欢和磨蹭的人做生意
I don't deal with time-wasters.

40
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,747
滚过来看摊
Get over here and tend this stall.

41
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,786
我要去酒吧来上一杯
I'm off to The SIaughtered Prince for a pint.

42
00:03:49,127 --> 00:03:50,958
看到喜欢的东西了么？
See anything you like?

43
00:03:53,565 --> 00:03:55,430
当然
Definitely.

44
00:03:55,534 --> 00:04:00,198
我是说…我的意思是这些，我喜欢这些蓝色的
I mean, what I meant was these ones, the blue ones.

45
00:04:01,106 --> 00:04:02,767
多少钱？
How much are they?

46
00:04:02,874 --> 00:04:05,741
我要你头发的颜色
They might be the color of your hair.

47
00:04:05,844 --> 00:04:09,974
或是，你三岁前的全部记忆
Or they might be all of your memories before you were three.

48
00:04:10,082 --> 00:04:12,346
如果你喜欢，我现在就可以结帐
I can check if you like.

49
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:16,888
总之，你不该买野风信子，买这个作为代替吧
Anyway, you shouldn't buy the bluebells. Buy this one instead.

50
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,154
雪莲花
Snowdrop.

51
00:04:21,159 --> 00:04:23,024
它能给你带来幸运
It'll bring you Iuck.

52
00:04:24,396 --> 00:04:26,330
但是这个我要付出什么呢？
But what does that cost?

53
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:29,966
一个吻
This one costs a kiss.

54
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:51,589
她走了么？
Is she gone?

55
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:54,889
跟我来
Follow me.

56
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,002
我是个公主…被陷害，成了女巫的奴隶
I'm a princess, tricked into being a witch's slave.

57
00:05:11,443 --> 00:05:12,967
你会救我么？
Will you liberate me?

58
00:05:22,187 --> 00:05:26,714
这是条施了魔法的链子，只有她死了我才能自由
It's an enchanted chain. I'll only be free when she dies.

59
00:05:28,126 --> 00:05:29,150
对不起
Sorry.

60
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:33,958
如果我救不了你，你又为什么让我进去呢？
Well, if I can't liberate you, what do you want of me?

61
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,307
所以，这位学者错了
So, the scientist was wrong-

62
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
这堵墙成功地完成了它的使命
The wall had successfully done its job

63
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:01,655
这使命就是保卫魔法王国风暴要塞不被发现
of hiding the magical kingdom of Stormhold-

64
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,628
那晚，年轻人回到了在英国的家
The young man returned that night to his home in England,

65
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:08,962
希望这次冒险会很快被遗忘
hoping that his adventure would soon be forgotten-

66
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:11,027
但是九个月之后
But nine months later, he received an unexpected souvenir-

67
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:14,527
他收到了一份意想不到的纪念品

68
00:06:22,614 --> 00:06:24,977
这个是给你的，被留在墙边
This was Ieft at the wall for you. It says here his name is Tristan.

69
00:06:24,994 --> 00:06:27,677
上面说，他的名字叫特里斯顿

70
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,200
{\fs56\bord0\shad0\pos(188,168)}<i>魔　幻　星　尘</i>

71
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,000
{\fs56\bord0\shad0\pos(188,168)\1c&H418BFC&}<i>魔　幻　星　尘</i>

72

75
00:06:52,277 --> 00:06:54,677
特里斯顿？别忘了带上花
Tristan? Don't forget the flowers.

76
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,374
是的，我带着呢，谢谢，爸爸
Yes. I've got them. Thank you, Father.

77
00:06:58,784 --> 00:07:03,187
十八年过去了，这个婴儿特里斯顿长大了
Eighteen years passed, and the baby Tristan grew up

78
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,921
对自己非比寻常的身世一无所知
knowing nothing of his unconventional heritage-

79
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,558
不过，不用去多想…
But never mind how the infant became a boy-

80
00:07:09,576 --> 00:07:12,358
一个婴儿是怎样长成一个男孩的

81
00:07:12,464 --> 00:07:15,474
这个故事是关于特里斯顿・索朗…
This is the story of how Tristan Thorn becomes a man,

82
00:07:15,494 --> 00:07:17,464
是怎样变成一个男人的

83
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:20,127
这可要经历更大的挑战
a much greater challenge altogether-

84
00:07:21,139 --> 00:07:23,437
为了达到这个目标
For to achieve it,

85
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:27,603
他必须赢得真爱的芳心
he must win the heart of his one true love-

86
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:31,612
是他！　　是他！
-It's him! -It's him!

87
00:07:35,821 --> 00:07:36,788
汉弗莱？
Humphrey?

88
00:07:36,788 --> 00:07:37,049
汉弗莱？
Humphrey?

89
00:07:38,156 --> 00:07:40,647
不，我是特里斯顿　　　哦…
-No, it's Tristan. -Oh.

90
00:07:42,127 --> 00:07:44,186
我把什么落在商店里了么？
Did I Ieave something at the shop?

91
00:07:44,296 --> 00:07:46,730
没，我只是想，我能带这个…
No. I just thought I could bring...

92
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,193
特里斯顿・索朗
Tristan Thorn,

93
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:53,203
白天在商店打杂，晚上跑来偷看女人
shop boy by day, peeping Tom by night.

94
00:07:53,305 --> 00:07:55,569
你到底有完没完了？
Is there no end to your charms?

95
00:07:56,575 --> 00:07:58,702
汉弗莱，没必要那样
Humphrey, there's no need to be like that.

96
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,744
对这个穷小子好一点
Be nice to the poor boy.

97
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,981
这些是给维多利亚的么？
Were those for Victoria?

98
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:21,358
特里斯顿，在学校，你的剑术总是那么没用
You were always useless at fencing in school, Tristan.

99
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,799
事实上，我实在是想不出你到底擅长什么
In fact, I'm having trouble remembering if there was anything you were good at.

100
00:08:24,903 --> 00:08:27,303
汉弗莱，够了
Humphrey, that's enough.

101
00:08:31,977 --> 00:08:34,036
你还好么？
Are you all right?

102
00:08:34,145 --> 00:08:35,373
是，是的，我很好
Yeah. Yeah, fine.

103
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:00,368
来点早餐？　　不，我要迟到了
-Want some breakfast? -No, I'm really Iate for work.

104
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:04,203
昨晚还好么？　　是的，很好，怎么了？
-Are you all right? -Yeah. Fine. Why?

105
00:09:04,309 --> 00:09:08,803
哦，我也说不好，昨晚发展的怎样？
Oh, I don't know. Last night, how'd it go?

106
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:12,315
哦，真的很好，真的，真的很好
Oh, really good. Really, really good.

107
00:09:27,566 --> 00:09:28,863
你好，特里斯顿
Hello, Tristan.

108
00:09:28,967 --> 00:09:31,458
维多利亚　　　一磅糖，谢谢
-Victoria. -Pound of sugar, please.

109
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,539
好的
-Yes. -Let's see, a bag of flour, a dozen eggs.

110
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:37,599
让我看看，我还要一袋面粉，一打鸡蛋

111
00:09:37,709 --> 00:09:40,769
听着，我为昨晚的事道歉，汉弗莱太粗鲁了
Oh, Iook, I'm sorry about Iast night. Humphrey was really rude.

112
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:44,474
我还要一大袋土豆和一些巧克力，谢谢
I also need a sack of potatoes and some chocolate, please.

113
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:50,721
我今晚可以去看你么？
May I perhaps see you tonight?

114
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,249
不，但你可以送我回家
No, but you may walk me home.

115
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,652
现在？
Now?

116
00:09:57,696 --> 00:09:59,323
是的，是的，我能
Yes. Yes, I can.

117
00:10:06,671 --> 00:10:08,502
爸，我丢了工作
Father, I Iost my job.

118
00:10:10,075 --> 00:10:12,873
爸，我没有…我的工作没了，对不起
Father, I don't... I Iost my job. I'm sorry.

119
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:15,173
爸爸　　　你被开除了
-Father... -You Iost your job.

120
00:10:15,981 --> 00:10:17,539
是的，我听说了
Yes, so I heard.

121
00:10:18,783 --> 00:10:20,683
爸爸，对不起，我…
Father, I'm sorry. I...

122
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,621
也许曼德先生说得对，我是在自欺欺人
Maybe Mr. Monday was right. Maybe I am deluding myself.

123
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:26,655
我配不上维多利亚
-I'm not good enough for Victoria. -He said that? That's poppycock.

124
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,955
他是这么说的？真是一派胡言

125
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,823
你真想知道那晚怎么样了？
You really want to know how it went Iast night?

126
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,021
是的
Yeah.

127
00:10:32,931 --> 00:10:34,193
不好
Not good.

128
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,691
算了，我在浪费时间
Come on. I'm wasting my time.

129
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,234
我不像汉弗莱
I'm not like Humphrey.

130
00:10:40,772 --> 00:10:42,709
特里斯顿，我想告诉你
Tristan, I can tell you that every man I ever envied when I was a boy

131
00:10:42,722 --> 00:10:45,909
我崇拜的每个人，在我还是个孩子的时候

132
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,605
他们的生活都在平常不过了
has Ied an unremarkable life.

133
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:51,634
所以你现在不太招人喜欢
So you don't fit with the popular crowd. Now, I take that as a very good omen.

134
00:10:51,648 --> 00:10:54,944
我把它看作是一个非常好的预兆

135
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,829
特里斯顿，我说得很清楚了…
-Tristan, I clearly said... -I know. You told me not to come.

136
00:11:08,849 --> 00:11:10,229
我知道，你告诉我不要来

137
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:12,829
我有些东西想给你，一个惊喜
I have something for you. A surprise.

138
00:11:13,938 --> 00:11:15,030
不…
No...

139
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,914
你是知道的，我还有一星期才过生日呢
It's not my birthday for another week, you know.

140
00:11:35,994 --> 00:11:39,827
我以前从没喝过香槟　　　是啊，我也没喝过
-I've never had champagne before. -Yeah, me, neither.

141
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:43,098
天啊！真好喝！
My God! This is delicious!

142
00:11:44,869 --> 00:11:47,770
你怎么…一个商店的人怎能付得起这个？
How did... Well, how does a shop boy afford all of this?

143
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:49,567
我不是商店里的人
I'm not a shop boy.

144
00:11:50,508 --> 00:11:52,703
天！我听说了，对不起，你现在想怎么办？
God! I heard. I'm sorry. What are you going to do now?

145
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:56,577
不…我不是商店打杂的，我是在商店工作
No. I mean, I'm not a shop boy. I was just working in a shop.

146
00:11:56,681 --> 00:11:59,912
而现在我不在了，我自由了，我可以过好日子
And now I'm not. Now I'm free to live my life as I wish.

147
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:02,486
这一定花掉了你全部积蓄
This must have been all your savings.

148
00:12:02,587 --> 00:12:05,613
怎么样？我可以做得更好，真是太美了
So? I can make more. That's the beauty of it.

149
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,316
我从没打算固守一隅，维多利亚
I never intended to stay in Wall, Victoria.

150
00:12:07,425 --> 00:12:10,758
外面的世界很大，我要去冒险
There's a big world out there, I'm gonna make my fortune.

151
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:13,490
现在你听起来像汉弗莱，他是个十足的旅者
Now you sound just like Humphrey. He's quite a traveler.

152
00:12:13,598 --> 00:12:15,990
你知道么，他要一路走去伊普斯威奇
Do you know he's going all the way to ipswich just to buy me a ring?

153
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,830
就为了给我买一枚戒指

154
00:12:17,936 --> 00:12:19,369
伊普斯威奇？
ipswich?

155
00:12:19,471 --> 00:12:23,430
维多利亚，我说的是伦敦，巴黎或是…
Victoria, I'm talking about London or Paris or...

156
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:27,341
戒指？他为什么…什么戒指？
A ring? Why is he... What kind of a ring?

157
00:12:27,445 --> 00:12:30,312
他打算在我的生日时向我求婚
The word is he's planning to propose to me on my birthday.

158
00:12:30,448 --> 00:12:32,006
他打算…
He's going to...

159
00:12:33,351 --> 00:12:34,750
你会说愿意？
And you're gonna say yes.

160
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:38,380
他一路走去伊普斯威奇，我怎能说不呢？
I can't exactly say no after he's gone all the way to ipswich.

161
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,583
“一路走去伊普斯威奇”？
"All the way to ipswich"?

162
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:43,795
维多利亚，如果能牵着你的手走进教堂
Victoria, for your hand in marriage, I'd cross oceans or continents.

163
00:12:43,812 --> 00:12:45,995
我愿意翻越万水千山

164
00:12:46,431 --> 00:12:47,921
真的？　　是的
-Really? -Yes.

165
00:12:48,032 --> 00:12:49,431
维多利亚，如果能牵着你的手走进教堂
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

166
00:12:49,534 --> 00:12:52,901
我愿意去旧金山淘金
I would go to the gold fields of San Francisco

167
00:12:53,004 --> 00:12:55,472
给你带回成堆的金子
and bring you back your weight in gold.

168
00:12:56,374 --> 00:12:57,602
我愿意
I would.

169
00:12:58,543 --> 00:13:02,570
我愿意去非洲，给你带回拳头大的钻石
I'd go to Africa and bring you back a diamond as big as your fist.

170
00:13:03,314 --> 00:13:06,181
或者，我愿意去北极，杀一只北极熊
Or I'd go to the Arctic and I'd slaughter a polar bear

171
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,411
把它的头带给你
and bring you back its head.

172
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:11,483
一只北极熊的头？
A polar bear's head?

173
00:13:16,194 --> 00:13:18,025
你真好玩，特里斯顿
You're funny, Tristan.

174
00:13:19,164 --> 00:13:23,066
像你…我这样的人，我们只是…
People like you and people like me, we're just not...

175
00:13:26,938 --> 00:13:28,405
我要走了，真的有点晚了
I should be going. It's really Iate.

176
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:32,033
不，等等，至少让我们把香槟喝完
Well, hold on, then. Let's at Ieast finish the champagne.

177
00:13:33,244 --> 00:13:34,336
好吧
Okay.

178
00:13:38,783 --> 00:13:42,776
要是特里斯顿知道，当时群星是怎样看着地球
Had Tristan known then how the stars watched Earth,

179
00:13:42,887 --> 00:13:44,684
他一定会担心
he'd have shuddered at the very thought

180
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:47,189
会被这些特别的观众羞辱
of an audience to his humiliation-

181
00:13:49,661 --> 00:13:51,356
但是，幸运的是
But, fortunately for him,

182
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:54,431
那时，天空中几乎所有的星星
nearly every star in the sky was at that moment

183
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:58,662
都在注视着东方的大地，墙另一边的世界
Iooking in earnest at the land on the other side of the wall,

184
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,331
风暴要塞的国王正躺在临终的床上
where the King of all Stormhold lay on his deathbed,

185
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,342
也许是个巧合，因为国王的最后这一行为
which was a coincidence because it was the King's final act

186
00:14:06,444 --> 00:14:11,814
将永远地改变特里斯顿一生的命运
that would change the course of Tristan's destiny forever-

187
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:15,985
塞肯多斯在哪？
Where is Secundus?

188
00:14:16,921 --> 00:14:18,980
他在回来的路上，父亲
He's on his way, Father.

189
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,785
那么我们只好等了
Then we shall wait.

190
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:32,032
对不起，我来晚了，父亲
Sorry I'm Iate, Father. I came as swiftly as I was able.

191
00:14:32,048 --> 00:14:34,432
我已经以最快的速度赶回来了

192
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,572
塞普蒂默斯
Septimus.

193
00:14:41,012 --> 00:14:42,206
普里默斯
Primus.

194
00:14:43,348 --> 00:14:44,542
特修斯
Tertius.

195
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:49,685
那么，关于继承权的问题
So, to the matter of succession.

196
00:14:51,689 --> 00:14:56,592
我的七个儿子，尚有四个站在这里
Of my seven sons, there are four of you today still standing.

197
00:14:56,694 --> 00:15:00,994
这可以说是破了先例了，我有十二个兄弟
This is quite a break with tradition. I had 12 brothers.

198
00:15:01,099 --> 00:15:02,896
为了王位，您把他们都杀了
And you killed them all for your throne

199
00:15:03,001 --> 00:15:06,027
就连您的父亲…国王…也自叹不如
before your father, the King, even felt poorly.

200
00:15:06,771 --> 00:15:09,604
我们都知道，父亲，您很强壮，有胆识
We know, Father. You're strong and courageous.

201
00:15:09,707 --> 00:15:13,575
奸诈，最重要的是，奸诈
And cunning. Most importantly, cunning.

202
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,042
塞肯多斯　　　是的，父亲
-Secundus. -Yes, Father?

203
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:22,449
看窗外，告诉我，你看到了什么？
Look through the window. Tell me what you see.

204
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:31,319
我看到了王国，父亲
I see the kingdom, Father.

205
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,759
整个风暴要塞
The whole of Stormhold.

206
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:38,563
还有呢？　　我的王国？
-And? -My kingdom?

207
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:41,070
也许，向上看
Maybe. Look up.

208
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:12,695
塞肯多斯　　　塞克多斯，阔多斯，昆多斯
-Secundus. -Sextus. Quartus. Quintus.

209
00:16:13,905 --> 00:16:18,001
你还活着，你还…
You're alive. You're...

210
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:21,010
像这样被困在这，直到新国王加冕
Stuck like this till the new king is crowned.

211
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:23,974
我离王位就差一步了
I was that close.

212
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:26,346
算了吧，至少你看起来还像个人样
Well, at Ieast you haven't Iost your Iooks.

213
00:16:26,451 --> 00:16:29,352
可别这么说，你还在为被谋杀的事耿耿于怀吧
Oh, please. You're not annoyed about that whole murder thing, are you?

214
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:32,446
…那已经是十年前的事了　　　是啊
-I mean, that was 10 years ago. -Yeah.

215
00:16:32,557 --> 00:16:34,457
杀了我给你增色不少吧…塞肯多斯？
Great deal of good it did you, didn't it, killing me, Secundus?

216
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:37,824
因为现在，当然，你就是风暴要塞的国王了
Because now, of course, now you are King of all Stormhold.

217
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:40,796
抱歉，等一下，不，你不是，你已经死了
Oh, sorry. Wait. No, you're not. You're dead.

218
00:16:40,898 --> 00:16:44,061
乌拉？乌拉？
Una? Una?

219
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:48,229
不，父亲，是我，你的儿子
No, Father, it's me, your son.

220
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,368
特修斯
Tertius.

221
00:16:52,777 --> 00:16:55,507
你的姐姐乌拉在哪？
Where is your sister, Una?

222
00:16:55,613 --> 00:16:58,912
对不起，父亲，已经有好几年没人看到乌拉了
Sorry, Father. Nobody has seen Una for years now.

223
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:01,212
塞普蒂默斯？　　什么？
-Septimus? -What?

224
00:17:01,319 --> 00:17:06,814
传统规定王位必须传给男性继承人
Tradition dictates the throne must pass to a male heir.

225
00:17:06,924 --> 00:17:09,051
正是如此，父亲
Exactly, Father.

226
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,890
几个白痴都还活着，我也没理由杀害我姐姐
So why would I kill my sister when these cretins are still alive?

227
00:17:11,996 --> 00:17:13,156
确实是这样
Indeed.

228
00:17:14,632 --> 00:17:18,302
因此，我们得用一个非常规的方法
Therefore, we shall resolve the situation in a non-traditional manner.

229
00:17:18,332 --> 00:17:20,502
来解决现在这个局面

230
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:49,565
只有拥有皇室血统的人，才能重铸这块红宝石
Only he of royal blood can restore the ruby.

231
00:17:49,667 --> 00:17:52,500
如果你们中的一个办到了
And the one of you that does so shall be the new King of Stormhold.

232
00:17:52,527 --> 00:17:56,300
那他就是风暴要塞的新国王

233
00:18:46,924 --> 00:18:49,586
哦，特里斯顿！一颗流星！
Oh, Tristan! A shooting star!

234
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,192
真美
Beautiful.

235
00:18:55,399 --> 00:18:58,968
比伊普斯威奇带回来的华丽戒指还美么？
More beautiful than a fancy ring from ipswich?

236
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:05,973
维多利亚，如果可以牵你的手走进教堂
Victoria, for your hand in marriage,

237
00:19:06,077 --> 00:19:09,740
我愿意跨过墙，把那颗坠落的星带给你
I'd cross the wall and I'd bring you back that fallen star.

238
00:19:10,014 --> 00:19:12,005
你不能翻过墙去
You can't cross the wall.

239
00:19:12,383 --> 00:19:14,977
每人能翻过这堵墙，你刚才是傻了吧
Nobody crosses the wall. Now you're just being silly.

240
00:19:15,086 --> 00:19:17,919
我没有傻，我愿意那么做
I'm not being silly. I'd do it.

241
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:21,681
为了你，我愿意做任何事
For you, I'd do anything.

242
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:24,561
我自己的星星
My very own star.

243
00:19:28,266 --> 00:19:30,928
看来我们俩有个一个约定
It seems we have ourselves an agreement.

244
00:19:31,903 --> 00:19:35,970
你只有一星期时间，否则我就要嫁给汉弗莱
You have exactly one week or I'm marrying Humphrey.

245
00:20:47,445 --> 00:20:51,438
莫拉！恩普拉！快起来！现在！
Mormo! Empusa! Wake up. Now!

246
00:20:52,483 --> 00:20:55,941
怎么了？　　一颗星坠落了
-What is it? -A star has fallen.

247
00:21:03,828 --> 00:21:05,591
我的巴比伦蜡烛呢？
Where are the Babylon candles?

248
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:10,395
你在二百年前把最后一根用光了，你不记得了？
You used the Iast one, Lamia, 200 years ago. Do you not recall?

249
00:21:10,501 --> 00:21:12,136
我们也许可以再找一个
Perhaps we can obtain another.

250
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:12,761
我们也许可以再找一个
Perhaps we can obtain another.

251
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:16,306
难道你的脑子和你的脸一样愚蠢么，恩普拉？
Has your mind become as decrepit as your face, Empusa?

252
00:21:16,407 --> 00:21:19,171
别信口开河
You speak as if such things are freely available.

253
00:21:19,277 --> 00:21:20,642
我知道，姐姐，我只是想…
I know, sister, I merely thought...

254
00:21:20,745 --> 00:21:22,269
你让我们去找巴比伦蜡烛
You'd have us hunting for a Babylon candle

255
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,144
而此时，其他女巫就可能找到了我们的星星
while some other witch finds our star.

256
00:21:25,249 --> 00:21:27,843
笨蛋，没时间浪费了
Fool. There's no time to waste.

257
00:21:28,586 --> 00:21:31,384
如果我们要用走的，那我们要…
If we must retrieve it on foot, then we shall.

258
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:33,582
莫拉，我要知道方位
Mormo, we need information.

259
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,702
如果预言是正确的
If these divinations are correct, the fallen star lies 1 00 miles away.

260
00:21:44,723 --> 00:21:47,702
这颗星坠落在一百公里的地方

261
00:21:50,841 --> 00:21:53,511
我们为这个已经等了几个世纪了
Four centuries we've waited for this. What hardship a few more days?

262
00:21:53,531 --> 00:21:56,211
再多等几天又有什么难的呢？

263
00:21:56,314 --> 00:21:59,750
我们中谁去把它找回来呢？
Which of us shall go, then, to seek it and bring it back?

264
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,723
我拿的是肾　　　我的是肝脏
-I've his kidney. -I've his liver.

265
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,522
我拿的是心脏
And I've his heart.

266
00:22:14,131 --> 00:22:17,157
我需要，上一颗星星留下的东西
You'll be needing what's Ieft of the Iast star.

267
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:27,975
已没剩多少了　　　很快，我们又会有许多
-There's not much Ieft. -Soon, there'll be plenty for us all.

268
00:23:24,368 --> 00:23:26,808
邓斯坦・索朗，休想再来一次
-Dunstan Thorn. Not again. -It's Tristan, actually.

269
00:23:26,828 --> 00:23:28,998
事实上，我是特里斯顿

270
00:23:29,874 --> 00:23:33,833
噢，你和你父亲长得可真像
Oh. You do Iook a bit like your father.

271
00:23:33,944 --> 00:23:37,402
我想你也是打算要跨越这堵墙，是么？
And I suppose you intend to cross the wall as well, do you?

272
00:23:37,515 --> 00:23:39,346
好吧，还是忘了这事，回家去吧
Well, you can forget it. Go home.

273
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,611
也跨越这堵墙，那是谁？
Cross the wall as well as who?

274
00:23:42,453 --> 00:23:44,751
没谁，没有人
No one. Nobody.

275
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:47,323
没有人跨过墙去，你知道的！
Nobody crosses the wall. You know that!

276
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,689
每个人都知道！
Everybody knows that!

277
00:23:49,794 --> 00:23:53,321
是啊…不不，我知道，我了解，没有人
Yeah... No, no, I know. I understand. Nobody.

278
00:23:55,132 --> 00:23:57,532
那么，我最好还是回老家喽
Well, I better just head for the old homestead, then.

279
00:23:57,635 --> 00:23:58,761
是的
Yeah.

280
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:03,033
这样才对，那么晚安，特里斯顿　　　晚安
-Right, then. Night, Tristan. -Good night.

281
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:05,233
给你爸爸带好
Give my best to your father.

282
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:29,730
还是回去吧
Off you go.

283
00:24:35,739 --> 00:24:37,572
我听见你进屋的声音了
I thought I heard you come in. Hey, what happened? Are you hurt?

284
00:24:37,589 --> 00:24:39,172
嘿，怎么了？你挨打了？

285
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:40,404
不，我没事
No, I'm fine.

286
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:42,001
又是汉弗莱干的？　　不
-That Humphrey again? -No.

287
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:45,945
事实上，是那个看守，那个看墙的人
Actually, it was the guard. The guard at the wall.

288
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,749
特里斯顿，他已经有97岁了
Tristan, he's 97 years old.

289
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:51,982
是啊，所以他用了足够的时间来练习？
Well, that's given him plenty of time to practice, then, hasn't it?

290
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,653
我能问你，为什么你要跨过那堵墙呢？
Why, may I ask, were you trying to cross the wall?

291
00:24:57,928 --> 00:25:00,226
这也是我想问的事
I might ask you the same thing.

292
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,572
我有一个妈妈
I have a mother.

293
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,985
我是说我有个妈妈，她可能还活着
I mean, I have a mother. She could still be alive.

294
00:25:56,086 --> 00:25:59,821
哦，我也希望如此，我当然也想这样
Oh, I hope so. I certainly like to think so.

295
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,587
你砍下的链子
The chain you cut.

296
00:26:05,763 --> 00:26:07,094
和你说的一样
Just like you said.

297
00:26:07,197 --> 00:26:08,323
还有…
And...

298
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:13,936
玻璃花，她卖给你的花
And the glass flower. The flower she sold to you.

299
00:26:14,038 --> 00:26:16,029
她说它能带给我幸运
She told me it would bring me Iuck.

300
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,437
谢谢
Thank you.

301
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:22,406
这个也是在篮子里带的，我从没打开过
This was also in the basket. I've never opened it.

302
00:26:23,147 --> 00:26:24,978
是写给你的
It's addressed to you.

303
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:42,424
哦
Yep.

304
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,227
“我亲爱的特里斯顿，请你理解
"My dearest Tristan, please know that I only ever wanted the best for you."

305
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,527
我只想把最好的给你”

306
00:26:48,472 --> 00:26:52,499
若我的主人允许，我愿与你形影不离
Had my mistress allowed it, I would have kept you in a heartbeat-

307
00:26:53,844 --> 00:26:56,711
我最大的愿望，就是有一天，能够见到你
My dearest wish is that we will meet someday-

308
00:26:58,382 --> 00:27:01,249
最快的旅行的方法就是利用蜡烛的光
The fastest way to travel is by candlelight-

309
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:05,554
用它，想着我，只想着我
To use it, think of me and only me-

310
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:10,424
我会每一天都像你，永远
I will think of you every day, for always-

311
00:27:13,063 --> 00:27:14,530
“你的母亲”
"Your mother."

312
00:27:21,705 --> 00:27:23,332
你有…你有火么？
Well, do you... Do you have a light?

313
00:28:08,318 --> 00:28:09,683
妈妈？
Mother?

314
00:28:09,787 --> 00:28:13,018
哦…妈妈，我…对不起，你还好么？
Oh! Oh, Mother, I'm so... I'm so sorry. Are you all right?

315
00:28:13,123 --> 00:28:16,888
不，我不是…你妈妈，从我身上下去！
No, I'm not. And I'm not your mother, so get off me!

316
00:28:16,994 --> 00:28:19,588
你…你不是我妈妈？
You're... You're not my mother?

317
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,995
你觉得我看起来像你妈妈么？
Do I Iook like I'm your mother?

318
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:24,391
不
No.

319
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,862
对不起
Sorry.

320
00:28:28,138 --> 00:28:29,867
那么，你还好么？需要帮忙么？
Well, are you all right? Do you want some help?

321
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:32,339
你唯一能帮我的就是离我远点
You can help by Ieaving me alone!

322
00:28:33,610 --> 00:28:34,941
好吧
All right.

323
00:28:42,186 --> 00:28:45,587
哦，天啊！“点蜡烛，想我”
Oh, my God. "Light the candle and think of me."

324
00:28:45,689 --> 00:28:47,714
我刚刚，我是在想我的…
I was. I was thinking of my...

325
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:50,555
只是，维多利亚和那颗星忽然闪过脑子
But then Victoria and the star just popped into...

326
00:28:54,498 --> 00:28:56,523
哦，打扰一下，女士，对不起
Oh, excuse me, madam. Sorry.

327
00:28:56,633 --> 00:29:00,935
这可能有点奇怪，但你有没有看到一颗星掉下来？
This may seem strange, but have you seen a fallen star anywhere?

328
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:03,236
你真好笑　　　不，真的，我们现在在坑里
-You're funny. -No, really, we're in a crater.

329
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,333
这一定是它掉下来的地方
This must be where it fell.

330
00:29:05,776 --> 00:29:07,403
是啊，这是它掉下来的地方
Yeah, this is where it fell.

331
00:29:07,511 --> 00:29:10,480
就这样，还是你想知道得具体点
It is. Or if you want to be really specific,

332
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:12,913
就在上面，奇怪的是，一条带血的项链
up there is where this weird, bloody necklace

333
00:29:13,016 --> 00:29:15,143
不知道从哪飞出来，从天空砸了下来
came out of nowhere and knocked it out of the heavens

334
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,083
它只是在想自己的事情
when it was minding its own business.

335
00:29:17,187 --> 00:29:19,087
而这，就是它掉下来的地方
And over there is where it Ianded.

336
00:29:19,189 --> 00:29:24,957
就在那，他被一个会飞的魔法白痴撞倒了！
And right here, this is where it got hit by a magical flying moron!

337
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:31,363
你就是那颗星！你是那颗星？真的？
You're the star! You're the star? Really?

338
00:29:32,035 --> 00:29:36,631
哦，哇，对不起，我不知道你…
Oh, wow. I'm sorry. I had no idea you'd be a...

339
00:29:38,709 --> 00:29:41,473
首先请允许我说声对不起
May I just say in advance that I am sorry?

340
00:29:41,812 --> 00:29:43,905
为什么对不起？　　就为这个
-Sorry for what? -For this.

341
00:29:44,014 --> 00:29:46,915
我若没想错，这你就得和我一起走了
Now, if I am not mistaken, this means you have to come with me.

342
00:29:47,017 --> 00:29:50,680
听着，你要成为我的真爱，维多利亚的寿礼
See, you're going to be a birthday gift for Victoria, my true Iove.

343
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,153
但是，当然！
But of course!

344
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:56,249
绑架一个受伤的女人做生日礼物，太浪漫了！
Nothing says romance like the gift of a kidnapped, injured woman!

345
00:29:56,593 --> 00:29:58,891
我哪都不和你去
I'm not going anywhere with you.

346
00:30:04,134 --> 00:30:07,035
快点，你该在路上了，普里默斯
Hurry. You should be on your way now, Primus.

347
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:12,298
你得在你兄弟之前找到那条红宝石项链
You must find the royal necklace with the ruby before your brothers.

348
00:30:12,409 --> 00:30:14,912
我真希望看到你能夺取王位
I should like to see you take the throne. The first benevolent king.

349
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:16,812
第一任仁慈的国王

350
00:30:17,481 --> 00:30:19,808
我从没怀疑过，如果你来统治…
I don't doubt Stormhold would be a better place under your rule.

351
00:30:19,821 --> 00:30:21,508
风暴要塞会变得更好

352
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:22,846
真的？
Really?

353
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:25,444
那真是太好了
Well, that is fascinating.

354
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,683
你不这么想，特修斯？　　我也是这样想
-Don't you think, Tertius? -Yes, indeed.

355
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:32,592
塞普蒂默斯王子！ 特修斯…我…
Prince Septimus! Tertius. Well... Well. Well, well, I...

356
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:37,194
既然你们都来了，何不一起喝一杯呢？
Since you're all here, won't you join me in a toast?

357
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:40,563
真是个不错的主意
What a very good idea.

358
00:30:40,671 --> 00:30:43,071
为风暴要塞的新国王干杯
To the new King of Stormhold,

359
00:30:43,173 --> 00:30:46,404
不管你们兄弟中谁成为国王
whichever of you fine fellows it might be.

360
00:30:47,144 --> 00:30:49,339
为风暴要塞的新国王干杯
To the new King of Stormhold.

361
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:31,779
你！
You!

362
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:58,874
你真觉得你会成为国王？
You really thought that you were king?

363
00:31:59,182 --> 00:32:01,582
你杀了主教？　　不，普里默斯
-You killed the Bishop? -No, Primus.

364
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:06,920
我想你知道，是你拿错了杯子才害了主教的
I think you'll find that you killed the Bishop by drinking out of the wrong cup.

365
00:32:07,591 --> 00:32:09,525
听着，在你和你的良知纠缠完后
Oh, Iook, when you finish wrestling with your conscience,

366
00:32:09,626 --> 00:32:12,356
我可以建议你还是回到你的房间么？
may I suggest you return to your chamber?

367
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:14,862
找石头的事就交给我吧
Leave the quest for the stone to me.

368
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,937
我们这几年怎么这样生活？
How have we lived this way all these years?

369
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:39,990
我不在时，希望你们能让它适合…
In my absence, I expect you to make it fit for the queens we are.

370
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,880
像我们这样的女王居住

371
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,861
当我带回奖品，我们所有人就又会年轻了
When I return with our prize, all of us shall be young again.

372
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:51,692
别害怕，妹妹们
Never fear, my sisters.

373
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:54,795
我不会失败的
I will not fail.

374
00:33:05,248 --> 00:33:06,681
你都不睡觉的么？
Don't you ever sleep?

375
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:07,750
晚上不
Not at night.

376
00:33:08,218 --> 00:33:09,583
可能没引起你的注意，天才
May have escaped your notice, genius,

377
00:33:09,686 --> 00:33:11,711
但是当晚上到来时，对星星而言
but that's when stars have rather better things to do.

378
00:33:11,822 --> 00:33:14,120
没有比出来发光这样的事更好的了
They're coming out, shining, that sort of thing.

379
00:33:14,224 --> 00:33:17,455
是啊…不过你可能没注意到你已不在天上了
Yeah, well, it may have escaped yours, but you're not in the sky anymore.

380
00:33:17,561 --> 00:33:19,529
出去已经不在日程上了
Coming out is off the agenda.

381
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:23,326
发光嘛，暂停直到另行通知
Shining has been suspended until further notice.

382
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,869
哦，在白天睡觉的日子，没…有…啦
Oh, and sleeping during the day is O-U-T.

383
00:33:27,604 --> 00:33:31,062
除非你有什么可以边走边睡的魔法
Unless you have some magical ability to sleep while you're walking.

384
00:33:31,174 --> 00:33:33,540
你那鱼木脑袋还没搞清楚么
Have you not got it into your thick head yet?

385
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,634
我哪也不去！
I'm not walking anywhere!

386
00:33:36,413 --> 00:33:37,539
好吧
Fine.

387
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:41,141
在坑里坐着吧，反正我也受够你了
Sit in a crater. I've had enough of you anyway.

388
00:33:41,518 --> 00:33:44,112
我本打算把你一带给维多利亚，就送你回天上
I was gonna put you back in the sky once I'd brought you to my Victoria,

389
00:33:44,221 --> 00:33:47,418
但显然，你情愿永远坐在这…哪也不去
but clearly, you'd rather sit on your own in the middle of nowhere forever.

390
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:50,891
只是你要怎么送我会天上呢？
And just how were you planning to get me back to the sky?

391
00:33:50,994 --> 00:33:54,259
我知道最快的旅行的方法是通过蜡烛的光
I find the fastest way to travel is by candlelight.

392
00:33:54,698 --> 00:33:58,566
你有巴比伦蜡烛？　　是，我有巴比零蜡烛
-You've got a Babylon candle. -Yeah, I have a bubbling candle.

393
00:33:58,668 --> 00:34:00,226
是巴比伦蜡烛　　　我就是那么说的啊
-A Babylon candle. -That's what I said.

394
00:34:00,337 --> 00:34:01,326
你说的是“巴比零”
You said "Bubbling."

395
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:03,838
不管怎样，我都会把剩下的给你
Anyway, I was going to give what's Ieft of it to you.

396
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:06,272
好吧，这个已经用得没剩多少了
Well, that barely has one use Ieft.

397
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:08,860
那你该高兴我现在不会用它…
So be grateful I'm not using it right now to get us both back to the wall.

398
00:34:08,876 --> 00:34:10,870
让我们俩马上回到墙那去

399
00:34:10,981 --> 00:34:14,348
除非你有带自己回家更好的办法
Unless you have a better way of getting yourself home.

400
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,113
好吧！
Fine!

401
00:34:18,555 --> 00:34:20,216
扶我起来
Help me up.

402
00:34:20,891 --> 00:34:23,291
好的，好的，我正在扶
All right. All right. I'm helping.

403
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:26,253
你得快点走
And you are gonna have to walk quicker than that.

404
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:29,127
否则，我一周内就赶不回维多利亚身边
Otherwise, I'll never get you back to Victoria in a week.

405
00:34:29,232 --> 00:34:30,699
欲速不达
Don't push your Iuck.

406
00:34:32,569 --> 00:34:36,437
少于一弗罗林不卖，伯纳德！听明白了？
Don't take Iess than a florin for him, Bernard! You understand?

407
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,667
是，妈妈　　　别磨磨蹭蹭的！
-Yes, Mother. -No dilly-dallying!

408
00:34:38,775 --> 00:34:42,677
也别想在酒馆歇着，伯纳德，否则有你好看！
And don't even think of stopping at the tavern, Bernard, or you'll be sorry!

409
00:34:42,779 --> 00:34:44,906
一弗罗林买这只羊，男孩
A florin for your goat, boy.

410
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:48,785
噢
Oh.

411
00:34:50,287 --> 00:34:52,755
它有点小，拉不动你的车
He's a bit small to pull your cart.

412
00:34:54,624 --> 00:34:56,319
说得很对
You're quite right.

413
00:35:06,636 --> 00:35:08,365
这样就好多了
That's much better.

414
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:14,271
伯纳德！
Bernard!

415
00:35:16,113 --> 00:35:17,341
伯纳德！
Bernard!

416
00:35:39,569 --> 00:35:40,763
快点
Get on!

417
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,270
你是谁？
Who goes there?

418
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:20,366
你要把我怎么样，我只是个穷卖花的…
What do you want with me, a poor old flower...

419
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:23,412
哦，快闭嘴，我知道你是做什么的
Oh, do shut up. I know what you are

420
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:28,143
我发誓你和我是一道的
and I swear by the ordinances of the sisterhood to which we both belong

421
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:30,719
我是说今天你不会伤人
that I mean you no harm this day.

422
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,811
我只是想吃点东西
I wish to share your meal.

423
00:36:33,256 --> 00:36:36,526
好吧，一个人总是要小心些才好
Well, one can never be too careful. Sit down. I'll get you a seat.

424
00:36:36,556 --> 00:36:39,126
坐下吧，我给你拿个椅子

425
00:36:48,071 --> 00:36:49,868
还要点别的么？　　不
-Anything else? -Nope.

426
00:36:53,476 --> 00:36:55,034
要那部分？
What's it to be?

427
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,203
头还是尾巴？
Heads or tails?

428
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:59,041
头
Heads.

429
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,579
那么，陌生人
So, stranger,

430
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,045
这么好的天，你赶着去哪？
where are you headed off to on this fine day?

431
00:37:06,156 --> 00:37:08,090
我正在找一颗坠落的星星
I seek a fallen star.

432
00:37:09,159 --> 00:37:10,956
她在离这不远的地方掉下来了
She fell not far from here.

433
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:13,291
当我找到她，我要拿出我的刀
And when I find her, I shall take my great knife

434
00:37:13,396 --> 00:37:15,864
趁她还活着，把她的心挖出来
and cut out her heart while she still lives.

435
00:37:15,966 --> 00:37:20,426
让我青春永驻
And the glory of our youth shall be restored.

436
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,403
坠落的星？
Fallen star?

437
00:37:23,573 --> 00:37:26,198
对我这上了年纪的人，这可是最好的消息了
That's the best news I've had in ages.

438
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:28,973
我可以再年轻几岁
I could do with Iosing a few years meself.

439
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,138
那你知道她的下落…
So whereabouts did you...

440
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:32,772
异形草！
Limbus grass!

441
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:38,218
你居然敢让我吃异形草…来套我的话？
You dare to steal truth from my lips by feeding me limbus grass?

442
00:37:38,321 --> 00:37:42,587
你知道你犯了一个多大的错误么？
Do you have any idea what a big mistake you've made, Ditchwater Sal?

443
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:45,786
你怎么知道我…
How do you know my...

444
00:37:45,895 --> 00:37:47,886
你是谁？　　看仔细点
-Who are you? -Look again.

445
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:54,335
我不是要找您的星，我发誓，黑暗女王
I shall not seek the star, Your Dark Majesty. I swear.

446
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:56,098
这就是你的想法
Seek all you wish.

447
00:37:58,275 --> 00:38:01,733
你不准看到星星的，摸到或是闻到它
You shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it.

448
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:06,906
即使她站在你眼前，你也感觉不到她的存在
You will not perceive her even if she stands before you.

449
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:16,759
祈祷你永远不会再遇见我吧
Pray you never meet me again, Ditchwater Sal.

450
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:18,952
哦，好吧，我就直说了吧
Oh, right. So Iet me get this straight.

451
00:38:19,062 --> 00:38:23,622
你以为你知道我们走的路没错，因为…
You think you know we're going the right way because...And I quote, "I just do."

452
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:26,400
我是这样觉得，尽管我也不知为什么
I do, though. I don't know why.

453
00:38:26,403 --> 00:38:29,065
也许是我的对维多利亚的爱在指引我回家
Maybe it's my Iove for Victoria guiding me home.

454
00:38:29,172 --> 00:38:30,730
拜托　　　亚尼，你是不是不想…
-PIease. -Yvonne, whether you like it or not...

455
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:33,468
亚伊尼！我的名字是亚伊尼，那么…
Yvaine! My name is Yvaine, so...

456
00:38:33,576 --> 00:38:35,874
我得和你说多少遍…
How many times do I have to...

457
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:38,743
你能…你能走慢点么？
Would you... Would you please slow down?

458
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,110
是的，是的
Yes, yes.

459
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:43,212
听着，我们…要向北走，对么？
Look, we're... We're going north, all right?

460
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,582
墙在北边
The wall's north.

461
00:38:44,688 --> 00:38:47,851
如果你抬头看天，即使白天，你也能看到…
And if you Iook up in the sky, even during the day, you can see the...

462
00:38:47,957 --> 00:38:49,652
晚上的星星，很奇怪
The evening star. That's so weird.

463
00:38:49,759 --> 00:38:51,624
真好笑，好笑，我都要累死了
That's funny. Hilarious. My sides are splitting.

464
00:38:51,728 --> 00:38:53,320
不，我只是在…
No, I'm being...

465
00:38:54,497 --> 00:38:57,694
等一下…那是你！真的？
Wait that... That was you! Really?

466
00:38:58,968 --> 00:39:00,731
什么…干什么…
What... What are...

467
00:39:00,837 --> 00:39:03,169
你在做什么？　　你看我像是在做什么？
-What are you doing? -What does it Iook like I'm doing?

468
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:05,434
坐下，我累了　　　请别再这样了
-Sitting down. I'm tired. -PIease don't do this again.

469
00:39:05,542 --> 00:39:08,010
说好了的，在下个村子停下吃东西休息
We agreed we'd stop off at the next village to eat and rest.

470
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:11,080
拜托，特里斯顿，现在是中午
Come on, Tristan. It's midday.

471
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:13,215
我从没这么晚还没睡！
I never stay up this Iate! Just, please, Iet me sleep!

472
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:16,015
就一会，求你了，让我睡一会！

473
00:39:16,853 --> 00:39:21,347
好吧，那…你睡觉，我去找点吃的
Okay, you... Well, then I'll... You sleep. I'll go and get something to eat.

474
00:39:28,131 --> 00:39:29,325
你这是做什么？
What are you doing?

475
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:31,464
我看起来像是在做什么？
What does it Iook like I'm doing? I'm making sure you don't run away.

476
00:39:31,482 --> 00:39:33,664
当然是确保你不会逃走啦

477
00:39:49,786 --> 00:39:54,189
殿下，这是你要的占卜者
Your Highness, the soothsayer, as you requested.

478
00:39:55,625 --> 00:39:57,217
南面，你说的？
South, you said.

479
00:39:58,194 --> 00:39:59,684
我们去了南面
South we went.

480
00:40:01,131 --> 00:40:02,655
还是没有石头
Still no stone.

481
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,694
你现在又想让我们去游泳么？
Do you now propose we start swimming?

482
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:11,866
陛下，我只是向您传达占卜石上告诉我的事
Sire, I've merely relayed to you what the runes have told me.

483
00:40:11,975 --> 00:40:13,567
我帮不了什么忙了
I can do no more.

484
00:40:14,844 --> 00:40:16,812
好吧，那你和他们再商量一次
Well, consult them again.

485
00:40:17,247 --> 00:40:18,339
等等
Wait.

486
00:40:21,351 --> 00:40:25,344
在开始找石头之前，我还有个问题
Before we seek the stone, I have another question.

487
00:40:27,290 --> 00:40:29,087
我是第七个儿子么？
Am I the seventh son?

488
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:34,722
是的
Yes.

489
00:40:34,831 --> 00:40:36,458
另一个问题
Another question.

490
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,828
我最喜欢的颜色是蓝色么？
Is my favorite color blue?

491
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,529
是
Yes.

492
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:48,372
我有听信过没用的请求和辩解么？
Has excessive begging or pleading ever persuaded me

493
00:40:48,478 --> 00:40:50,742
尤其是对那些活得太久或是叛国者？
to spare the life of a traitor?

494
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,574
这个意味着什么？
What does that mean?

495
00:40:55,685 --> 00:40:58,245
意思是，不　　　很好
-That means no. -Good.

496
00:40:59,222 --> 00:41:02,157
再扔一次，这一次，仍高点
Throw them again. This time, throw them high.

497
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,288
你是为我弟弟工作的么？
Do you work for my brother?

498
00:41:24,714 --> 00:41:27,740
那么？我们继续向西？
So, do we continue west?

499
00:41:58,214 --> 00:41:59,408
特里斯顿？
Tristan?

500
00:42:08,424 --> 00:42:09,823
谁？
Who's there?

501
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,063
特里斯顿，是你么？
Tristan, is that you?

502
00:42:20,169 --> 00:42:21,659
这一点也不好玩
It's not funny.

503
00:42:26,009 --> 00:42:27,237
特里斯顿？
Tristan?

504
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,648
到这边来
Come on.

505
00:43:22,031 --> 00:43:24,625
留心你用了多少魔法，姐姐
Be careful how much magic you use, sister.

506
00:43:24,734 --> 00:43:26,531
已经开始显现了
It's beginning to show.

507
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:28,469
只是一只小羊和一小点迷幻术
One goat and a small enchantment. Hardly extravagant.

508
00:43:28,476 --> 00:43:29,969
几乎没用过什么奢侈的魔法

509
00:43:30,073 --> 00:43:33,008
连用一下戒指也会损害它
Well, even using the ring will take its toll.

510
00:43:33,109 --> 00:43:35,441
下次有急事时，再找我们两个
Better you call on us only in dire need.

511
00:43:35,545 --> 00:43:38,844
用占卜石自己确定星星的位置
And use your runes to Iocate the star yourself.

512
00:43:39,050 --> 00:43:43,848
但现在，他们简直是在胡说八道
But now they're just telling me gibberish.

513
00:44:01,304 --> 00:44:04,102
你得待在那等，我的妹妹
It is because you must stay where you are, my sister.

514
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:05,435
她会走向你的
She is coming to you.

515
00:44:05,541 --> 00:44:08,169
哦，要小心，拉米亚，要注意细节
Oh, be warned, Lamia. Delicacy is needed.

516
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:12,304
痛苦困扰着她，她几乎不能发光了
Misery has drained her. She's barely shining.

517
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:15,748
设个陷阱，确保她在你挖出她的心之前…
Set a trap that ensures her heart is glowing before you cut it out.

518
00:44:15,755 --> 00:44:17,548
还是生机勃勃的

519
00:44:17,987 --> 00:44:21,150
亚伊尼！亚伊尼！
Yvaine! Yvaine!

520
00:44:22,025 --> 00:44:23,515
哦，你这个傻瓜
Oh, you idiot.

521
00:44:45,281 --> 00:44:47,909
你可以变成人了
You shall become human.

522
00:46:04,961 --> 00:46:06,659
你叫比利，旅馆的主人
You are Billy, the innkeeper. I am your wife, and you're our daughter.

523
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,159
我是你妻子，而你是我们的女儿

524
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:11,245
现在，以求准备就绪
Now, make everything ready. Our special guest will be here soon.

525
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:13,725
我们特殊的客人马上就要来了

526
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:28,743
谁能保证他会信守关于蜡烛的诺言呢？
I mean, who's to say he'd have even kept his promise about the candle?

527
00:46:28,851 --> 00:46:32,514
我不相信，他是在风暴要塞唯一一个
I just refuse to believe he's the only person in Stormhold

528
00:46:32,622 --> 00:46:34,317
能帮我的人
who could've helped me.

529
00:46:34,423 --> 00:46:38,689
翻来覆去地只说“维多利亚这个…那个”
Going on and on and on. Just "Victoria this" and "Victoria that."

530
00:46:41,097 --> 00:46:42,325
特里斯顿？
Tristan?

531
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:46,360
请保护我们的妹妹，特里斯顿
Please protect our sister, Tristan-

532
00:46:47,403 --> 00:46:50,236
亚伊尼正处在危险中
Yvaine is in grave danger-

533
00:46:51,073 --> 00:46:53,371
独角兽去帮她了
The unicorn came to help her-

534
00:46:54,110 --> 00:46:56,601
但是现在他们正走向一个圈套
But now they're heading into a trap-

535
00:47:00,616 --> 00:47:03,414
在风暴要塞，没有星星是绝对安全的
No star is safe in Stormhold-

536
00:47:04,353 --> 00:47:08,653
400年前，上个星星坠落了
The last to fall, 400 years ago,

537
00:47:08,758 --> 00:47:10,594
她被女巫捕获了
was captured by the same witches who seek Yvaine now-

538
00:47:10,618 --> 00:47:14,094
现在寻找亚伊尼的，正是那群女巫

539
00:47:15,298 --> 00:47:16,925
她们欺骗了她
They tricked her,

540
00:47:18,467 --> 00:47:19,957
照顾她
cared for her,

541
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,899
知道她的心再次发光
and when her heart was once more aglow,

542
00:47:25,508 --> 00:47:28,875
然后剖开她的胸膛，把心拿出来
they cut it from her chest

543
00:47:29,946 --> 00:47:31,573
再吃了它
and ate it-

544
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:36,118
不能再浪费时间了
There's no time to waste-

545
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:37,948
马车马上就来了
A coach is coming-

546
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:41,683
不管用什么方法，你一定要坐上去
By any means possible, you must get on it-

547
00:47:42,325 --> 00:47:43,383
快！
Run-

548
00:48:14,323 --> 00:48:15,415
哇！
Whoa!

549
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:26,892
如果要我送个男孩给他干活
If Septimus insists on sending a boy to do a man's job...

550
00:48:27,003 --> 00:48:27,992
不，不，不，请等等！
No, no, no, wait, please!

551
00:48:28,104 --> 00:48:29,969
我不认识塞普蒂默斯，只想搭个便车
I don't know a Septimus. I just need a lift.

552
00:48:30,072 --> 00:48:32,870
看看我…我没武器，求你
Look at me, Iook at me. I'm unarmed. PIease.

553
00:48:33,309 --> 00:48:35,368
求你，让我和你一起走
PIease, Iet me ride with you.

554
00:48:35,478 --> 00:48:38,845
恐怕不行，我有重要的事情要办
I'm afraid that's impossible. I'm on a quest of enormous importance.

555
00:48:38,948 --> 00:48:40,848
那你更应该带上我了
Well, then all the more reason to take me with you.

556
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:44,442
必要时你会需要多一双手来帮你，先生？
There may come a time when you need a second pair of hands. Sir?

557
00:48:44,553 --> 00:48:48,882
求你，命运让我见到你，就向它让你见到我一样
PIease. Maybe providence sent me to you just as it sent you to me.

558
00:48:49,625 --> 00:48:52,321
上来　　　哦，好的，谢谢
-Get on. -Oh, yes. Thank you.

559
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:20,947
天啊，亲爱的，外面这么大雨，进来吧
Goodness me, my dear. Come in out of this wretched rain!

560
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:23,622
我们有食物和饮料，温暖的床
We have food and drink, a warm bed and plenty of hot water for a bath.

561
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:25,622
还提供充足的热水供你洗澡

562
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:48,878
你喜欢怎样洗？温水，热水还是沸水？
How do you like your bath? Warm, hot or boil-a-Iobster?

563
00:49:49,819 --> 00:49:51,013
说实话我也不知道
I honestly don't know.

564
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:52,519
那我来帮你决定吧
Then Iet me choose for you,

565
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:55,818
我会让我的丈夫把你的马带到马房里
and I'll have my husband take your horse to the stable.

566
00:49:56,792 --> 00:49:57,918
比利？
Billy?

567
00:50:08,804 --> 00:50:12,069
现在，我们帮你把湿衣服脱掉好吗？
Now, Iet's get you out of your wet things, shall we?

568
00:50:23,386 --> 00:50:24,853
感到好些了吗？
Feeling better?

569
00:50:24,954 --> 00:50:26,683
好多了，谢谢
Much. Thank you.

570
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,580
温水实际上让我很舒服
The warm water's actually done me a world of good.

571
00:50:29,692 --> 00:50:32,661
知道了吧？热水澡的威力就在这儿
You see? The powers of a nice, hot bath.

572
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:35,196
你的腿部？感觉好些了吗？
And your Ieg? Any improvement?

573
00:50:37,099 --> 00:50:38,930
棒极了
That is extraordinary.

574
00:50:39,435 --> 00:50:43,166
我只能做些小事，你感到舒服我很高兴
It's the very Ieast I could do. I'm just glad you're feeling better.

575
00:50:43,272 --> 00:50:45,137
你看起来也很快乐的样子
You seem happier in yourself, too.

576
00:50:45,241 --> 00:50:48,540
我确实感到快乐点，烦恼慢慢消失
I do feel happier. Less troubled.

577
00:50:49,779 --> 00:50:50,939
太棒了
Wonderful.

578
00:50:51,347 --> 00:50:54,942
没有比泡热水澡更能温暖你心中的折皱了
Nothing like a nice soak to warm the cockles of your heart.

579
00:51:02,925 --> 00:51:06,258
现在，我只是个旅馆主妇
Now, I'm only a simple innkeeper's wife,

580
00:51:06,362 --> 00:51:09,854
但人们说我有一双可以帮人疗养的手
but I've been told I have a healer's hands.

581
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:13,434
我可以给你按摩
I'd be glad to give you a massage.

582
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:15,459
按摩是什么？
What's a massage?

583
00:51:15,571 --> 00:51:18,802
没试过…上帝啊
Never had... Well, bless my soul.

584
00:51:19,542 --> 00:51:23,672
没什么能使你被按摩后那样，睡得又香又甜
Nothing like a massage to send you off for the finest and deepest night's sleep.

585
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:25,246
我确实晚上很难入睡
I do have trouble sleeping at night.

586
00:51:25,347 --> 00:51:27,212
躺下吧，亲爱的
Lie on your back, dear.

587
00:51:30,252 --> 00:51:32,220
为什么不闭上眼睛？
Why not close your eyes?

588
00:51:33,289 --> 00:51:35,655
闭上眼睛可以更快入睡
You'll drift off better that way.

589
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:51,063
有人吗！
Hello!

590
00:51:53,175 --> 00:51:54,164
需要服务！
Service!

591
00:51:54,276 --> 00:51:56,801
可能我们应该继续找下一个旅店
Maybe we should carry on and try the next inn,

592
00:51:56,912 --> 00:51:59,642
如果石头靠近你的罗盘了，更应该这样
especially if this stone is as close as your runes say.

593
00:51:59,748 --> 00:52:01,477
我再试一次
I'll give it one more try.

594
00:52:06,021 --> 00:52:07,249
放松，亲爱的
Relax here, my Iove.

595
00:52:07,356 --> 00:52:10,723
我一接待完客人，就马上回来
I'll be back just as soon as I've taken care of this customer.

596
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,265
终于，我们需要住宿
At Iast. We require accommodation.

597
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:21,700
请帮我的朋友把马带到马房里
PIease help my friend take the horses to the stables.

598
00:52:35,684 --> 00:52:36,810
有人吗！
Hello!

599
00:52:39,688 --> 00:52:40,655
哦
Oh.

600
00:52:57,439 --> 00:52:58,929
我习惯享用较好的服务
I'm accustomed to better service,

601
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:01,908
不过既然把你吵醒了，那就这样吧
but you're awake now and that's what counts.

602
00:53:02,778 --> 00:53:04,109
把最好的客房为我准备好
Prepare your best room.

603
00:53:04,213 --> 00:53:05,271
她戴着宝石　　　宝石，宝石
-She got the stone. -Stone, stone.

604
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:09,545
谢谢你没打扰我的客人，先生，我是店主夫人
I'll thank you not to bother my guest, sir. I am the Iady of this inn.

605
00:53:09,652 --> 00:53:11,176
一杯葡萄酒？
GIass of wine?

606
00:53:11,287 --> 00:53:12,481
不，不，不，不，不
No, no, no, no, no.

607
00:53:13,389 --> 00:53:14,378
不
No.

608
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:19,384
在我兄弟死之前，我发誓只喝我自己的酒
Until my brother is dead, I have vowed to drink only my own wine.

609
00:53:21,530 --> 00:53:25,022
我在外面马房的朋友可能会喝点
Though my friend in the stables might be glad of a drop.

610
00:53:27,336 --> 00:53:29,270
你最好的客房，有吗？
Your best room, perhaps?

611
00:53:30,873 --> 00:53:32,204
当然
Of course.

612
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:41,542
对不起，我假定…
I'm sorry. I presumed that...

613
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:44,085
独自旅行，是吗？
Traveling alone, are you?

614
00:53:45,588 --> 00:53:48,955
我刚把四匹公马和马车放在马房里
I've just stabled my four black stallions and my carriage.

615
00:53:49,058 --> 00:53:52,186
我说我的，他们是我过世的父亲的
Well, I say mine. It belonged to my Iate father.

616
00:54:06,175 --> 00:54:07,403
谢谢
Thank you.

617
00:54:07,509 --> 00:54:11,809
你真好，非常感谢，我叫特里斯顿，你呢？
That's so kind, thank you very much. My name's Tristan. What's yours?

618
00:54:11,914 --> 00:54:13,142
伯纳德
Bernard.

619
00:54:20,956 --> 00:54:24,084
没什么马匹或牲畜…他不能驾御的
There was not a horse or beast he could not master.

620
00:54:24,193 --> 00:54:26,923
他年轻时，曾经去骑一头骆驼
So much so that in his youth, he took to riding a camel,

621
00:54:27,029 --> 00:54:28,394
显得非常滑稽
which was comical.

622
00:54:28,497 --> 00:54:30,590
他死后，马车就归我了
When he passed, the carriage came to me.

623
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:31,723
她戴着宝石
She's got the stone!

624
00:54:31,834 --> 00:54:32,823
她戴着宝石　　　她戴着宝石
-She's got it! -She's got it!

625
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:36,200
他们说是要塞里最大的马车
And it's the Iargest in all of Stormhold, so they say.

626
00:54:36,305 --> 00:54:39,069
太棒了，失陪一下
How nice for you. If you'll excuse me.

627
00:54:39,174 --> 00:54:40,266
等等
Wait.

628
00:54:40,976 --> 00:54:42,967
你戴着那个宝石，不可能吧
That stone you're wearing. It can't be.

629
00:54:43,078 --> 00:54:44,670
哦，终于…　　是啊，好的，不错
-Oh, finally. -Yeah, good, well done, yes, sir.

630
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:45,747
干得不错　　　宝贝
-Well done. -Sweet.

631
00:54:45,848 --> 00:54:46,837
过来，让我看看
Come here. Let me see it.

632
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:01,886
你根本不明白你动了谁的东西
You have no idea what you're meddling with.

633
00:55:01,997 --> 00:55:04,999
我是普里默斯，风暴要塞的老大
I am Primus, the first born of Stormhold and I demand that you bring it to me!

634
00:55:05,017 --> 00:55:07,799
我要求你赶快把它给我

635
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,393
把宝石给我，现在就给我！
Bring me the stone! Now!

636
00:55:09,505 --> 00:55:10,633
普里默斯王子！
Prince Primus! Don't touch anything they give you! They tried to...

637
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:12,933
他们给你的任何东西都别碰，他们想…

638
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,921
你还好吗？　　比利
-Are you all right? -Billy!

639
00:55:33,095 --> 00:55:34,221
抓住他！
Get him!

640
00:56:12,835 --> 00:56:15,235
虽然你那弱小无力的心
The burning golden heart of a star at peace

641
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:18,363
跟那金子般珍贵的星星之心比起来，不值一提
is so much better than your frightened little heart.

642
00:56:18,474 --> 00:56:22,410
但也总比没有强
Even so, better than no heart at all.

643
00:56:24,413 --> 00:56:27,109
亚伊尼？抓紧我，心里想着家
Yvaine? Hold me tight and think of home.

644
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:37,952
不！
No!

645
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,985
你到底干了什么？
-What the hell did you do? -What did I do? What did you do?

646
00:56:57,999 --> 00:57:00,815
我干了什么？你到底干了什么？

647
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,817
“心里想着家！”这想法太好了
"Think of home!" That was a great plan!

648
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,978
你想着你的家，而我想着家
You thought of your home and I thought of mine

649
00:57:06,088 --> 00:57:07,953
现在我们在两个家中间了！
and now we're halfway between the two!

650
00:57:08,056 --> 00:57:11,116
哦，你这头蠢猪！你想着你的家干什么？
Oh, you stupid cow! What did you think of your home for?

651
00:57:11,226 --> 00:57:12,659
你只是说“家”！
You just said "home"!

652
00:57:12,761 --> 00:57:16,094
如果你要我想着你的家，你应该告诉我！
If you wanted me to think of your home, you should have said!

653
00:57:16,198 --> 00:57:18,632
疯子妇人想把你的心切下来
Some crazy Iady was going to cut your heart out

654
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:20,463
你需要更详细的解释吗？
and you wanted more specific instructions?

655
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:23,970
把它写成书，还是画成图解！
Perhaps you'd like it in writing! Or a diagram, maybe!

656
00:57:32,347 --> 00:57:36,147
看，莎士比亚船长！逮住一点战利品
Look, Captain Shakespeare! Caught ourselves a little bonus!

657
00:57:36,752 --> 00:57:39,050
马歇尔夫妇
A couple of Lightning Marshals!

658
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:45,985
我觉得他们不象马歇尔夫妇
They don't Iook like Lightning Marshals to me.

659
00:57:46,094 --> 00:57:49,188
为什么有人会跑这么高到风暴骤雨里来？
Why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?

660
00:57:49,298 --> 00:57:52,495
“为什么有人会跑这么高，到暴风骤雨里来？”
"Why else would anyone be up here in the middle of a storm?"

661
00:57:52,634 --> 00:57:54,363
那么，让我们想想
Well, Iet's think.

662
00:57:54,470 --> 00:57:57,735
大概和我们来这儿是同样的原因！
Maybe for the same godforsaken reason we are!

663
00:57:58,474 --> 00:58:00,032
现在，你们是谁？
Now, who are you?

664
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:03,941
让他们在禁闭室里舒舒服服住一晚后
Let's see if a night on our Iovely brig will Ioosen their lips!

665
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:05,241
便会开口说话的！

666
00:58:05,247 --> 00:58:08,182
带他们去禁闭室！　　听到吗！我们进去！
-Get them in the brig! -You heard the man! Let's go!

667
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:13,050
带他们去禁闭室！剩下的家伙回去干活！
Get them into the brig and the rest of you dirty dogs, back to work!

668
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:15,749
我们得捕获更多闪电，快啊！
We've got lightning to catch! Come on!

669
00:58:39,748 --> 00:58:43,514
他们会杀了我们是吧？　　我不知道
-They're going to kill us, aren't they? -I don't know.

670
00:58:46,188 --> 00:58:49,055
你知道，这看来好笑，我习惯看着…
You know, it's funny. I used to watch...

671
00:58:50,459 --> 00:58:53,189
我习惯看着人们进行探险
I used to watch people having adventures.

672
00:58:55,297 --> 00:58:56,787
我嫉妒他们
I envied them.

673
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,269
你听说过“小心你所期望的东西”吗？
You ever heard the expression, "Be careful what you wish for"?

674
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:04,066
什么？难道是最后切下我的心就满足了？
What? So ending up with my heart cut out, that'll serve me right, will it?

675
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:07,198
不，不，我不是…那个意思
No. No, I didn't... I didn't mean it like that.

676
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,338
我很欣赏你在梦想
Look, I admire you dreaming.

677
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:14,716
我这样的小店男童
Shop boy like me,

678
00:59:14,816 --> 00:59:16,716
从来没有想过去做这么大的探险
I could never have imagined an adventure this big

679
00:59:16,818 --> 00:59:19,082
去实现愿望
in order to have wished for it.

680
00:59:19,454 --> 00:59:22,389
我只是想，我会找到天上掉下的那些石头
I just thought I'd find some Iump of celestial rock

681
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:25,085
把它带回家，就这样
and take it home, and that would be it.

682
00:59:25,193 --> 00:59:26,524
你把我抓住了
And you got me.

683
00:59:34,836 --> 00:59:36,823
在我看着地球的这么多年里
If there's one thing I've Iearned in all my years watching Earth,

684
00:59:36,836 --> 00:59:38,863
如果要说一件我学到的东西

685
00:59:38,974 --> 00:59:41,772
那就是人们并不都是象表面看上去的那样
it's that people aren't what they may seem.

686
00:59:42,511 --> 00:59:43,535
有小店男童
There are shop boys

687
00:59:43,645 --> 00:59:47,911
有些男孩碰巧暂时在小店里工作
and there are boys who just happen to work in shops for the time being.

688
00:59:48,016 --> 00:59:52,009
相信我，特里斯顿，你不是小店男童
And trust me, Tristan, you're no shop boy.

689
00:59:54,256 --> 00:59:56,918
你挽救了我的生命，谢谢你
You saved my life. Thank you.

690
01:00:01,897 --> 01:00:03,489
不错，不错，不错
Well, well, well.

691
01:00:04,132 --> 01:00:05,963
最后一个兄弟死了
The Iast brother dead.

692
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:09,728
也就是说我是国王了
Which means that I'm king.

693
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:15,037
我是国王！
I'm king!

694
01:00:18,013 --> 01:00:19,605
还不是，兄弟
Not yet, brother.

695
01:00:20,882 --> 01:00:23,077
该死，我还得拿到宝石
Damn. I still need the stone.

696
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,085
你兄弟没拿到吗？
-Your brother doesn't have it? -Well, why don't you find out?

697
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:28,085
那你为什么不去找到它？

698
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:39,960
我的宝石在哪？
Where is my stone?

699
01:00:40,068 --> 01:00:41,797
我不…
I don't...

700
01:00:41,903 --> 01:00:43,704
那个人，知道吗，就是你兄弟
The man, see, your brother... I heard him speak of a stone.

701
01:00:43,713 --> 01:00:44,904
我听到他谈到宝石

702
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:47,807
是的，在女孩那，在女孩那
Yeah. The girl had it. The girl had it.

703
01:00:47,909 --> 01:00:49,809
什么女孩？　　我不知道
-What girl? -I don't know.

704
01:00:49,911 --> 01:00:52,607
一个女孩，她走了，这都是给她做的陷阱
A girl. She got away. Because this was a trap set up for her,

705
01:00:52,714 --> 01:00:55,774
但你兄弟，他直接走进陷阱里
but your brother, he come just straight into it.

706
01:00:55,884 --> 01:00:58,148
陷阱？谁做的？
A trap? Set by who?

707
01:00:58,453 --> 01:01:00,353
一个你祈祷永远也不愿见到的女人
A woman you should pray you'll never meet.

708
01:01:00,455 --> 01:01:01,649
她已经…
She's...

709
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:05,491
她已经走了，她带走了你兄弟的马车
She's gone. She took your brother's carriage.

710
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:07,687
这个女人要我的石头吗？
This woman wanted my stone?

711
01:01:07,796 --> 01:01:10,196
不是，她要那个女孩的心
No. She wanted the girl's heart.

712
01:01:10,298 --> 01:01:14,598
她说那个女孩是个星星，她要切下她的心
She said the girl was a star and she wanted to cut out her heart and...

713
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:18,433
吃掉
Eat it?

714
01:01:20,208 --> 01:01:21,573
哦，我的天
Oh, my God.

715
01:01:23,145 --> 01:01:25,705
你知道这意味着什么吗？
Do you have any idea what this means?

716
01:01:27,015 --> 01:01:28,642
永恒的生命
Everlasting life.

717
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:32,009
永远的国王
King forever.

718
01:01:36,158 --> 01:01:37,716
不在里面，陛下
It's not here, sire.

719
01:01:37,826 --> 01:01:39,919
这个蠢货和我们一起去
This idiot's coming with us.

720
01:02:04,352 --> 01:02:06,411
再问问　　　我们已经问过了
-Ask again. -We have asked again

721
01:02:06,521 --> 01:02:08,819
答案是同样的，她是空中传送的！
and the answer is still the same. She is airborne!

722
01:02:08,924 --> 01:02:10,221
那么，她不可能永远这样
Well, she can't remain so forever.

723
01:02:10,325 --> 01:02:12,293
她一旦到地上立刻通知我！
Inform me as soon as she touches ground!

724
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,294
立刻！你懂了吗？
Immediately! Do you understand?

725
01:02:14,396 --> 01:02:15,957
注意你的语气，姐姐！
Watch your tongue, sister! It is you and not we who've Iost her.

726
01:02:15,976 --> 01:02:17,957
是你把她弄丢了，而不是我们

727
01:02:18,066 --> 01:02:19,931
把她弄丢了，把刀也弄断了！
Lost her and broken the knife!

728
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:23,004
即使你逮住她，你如何把她的心切下来？
Even if you apprehend her, how will you complete the deed?

729
01:02:23,105 --> 01:02:24,472
也许你现在该回来
Perhaps you should return now and one of us set out in your place.

730
01:02:24,485 --> 01:02:26,572
然后由我们姐妹中的一个取代你的位置

731
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:27,769
别胡说了
Don't be absurd.

732
01:02:27,876 --> 01:02:30,743
我会把她带回来，在那就把她处理好
I'll bring her home and deal with her there.

733
01:02:30,846 --> 01:02:33,713
最好在我回来时，看到一切都准备就绪了
Be sure everything is ready for our arrival.

734
01:02:40,555 --> 01:02:42,682
告诉我一点关于维多利亚的故事
Tell me about Victoria then.

735
01:02:46,328 --> 01:02:47,955
她…
Well, she...

736
01:02:51,533 --> 01:02:54,127
没什么可说的
There's nothing more to tell you.

737
01:02:54,236 --> 01:02:59,765
我对爱不太懂，但我知道它是无条件的
Because the little I know about Iove is that it's unconditional.

738
01:03:00,509 --> 01:03:02,909
它不是什么你可以买到的
It's not something you can buy.

739
01:03:03,011 --> 01:03:05,878
等等，不是我去买她的爱
Hang on. This wasn't about me buying her Iove.

740
01:03:07,979 --> 01:03:10,743
我只是用一种方式来证明我对她的感受
This was a way for me to prove how I felt.

741
01:03:13,518 --> 01:03:16,487
那为了证明她对你的感受，她又做了什么？
And what's she doing to prove how she feels about you?

742
01:03:16,587 --> 01:03:17,747
嗯…
Well...

743
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,960
亚伊尼，当你看到她时你就会懂了，好吗？
Look, Yvaine, you'll understand when you meet her. All right?

744
01:03:26,464 --> 01:03:29,524
前提是我们不被海盗杀掉
Provided we don't get murdered by pirates first.

745
01:03:30,568 --> 01:03:35,665
被海盗杀掉，心被淘出来吃掉，认识维多利亚
Murdered by pirates. Heart torn out and eaten. Meet Victoria.

746
01:03:35,773 --> 01:03:38,571
我不知道哪个听起来更好玩
I can't quite decide which sounds more fun.

747
01:03:41,112 --> 01:03:43,342
我们已经知道飞船在哪了
We've Iocated the sky vessel.

748
01:03:43,448 --> 01:03:46,042
她正向着北部伦敦德里的港口小镇飞去
It's headed north for the port town on Mount Drummond

749
01:03:46,150 --> 01:03:49,483
你们不再是唯一正在追踪星星的人了
and you are no Ionger the only one seeking the star.

750
01:03:49,587 --> 01:03:51,555
有个人也跟着你去了！
There's someone following your tracks!

751
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:53,749
一个女巫？一个术士？
A witch? A warlock?

752
01:03:53,858 --> 01:03:56,986
一个王子，他正追上你！赶快前进吧！
A prince and he's catching you up! Get a move on!

753
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:28,472
那现在时候到了，你们得告诉我你们是谁
So, this is the part where you tell me who you are and why you're up here.

754
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,792
你们为什么跑到天上来

755
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:33,579
不然我会象吃棒棒糖一样
Or I'll snap her pretty little fingers one by one like dry twigs!

756
01:04:33,596 --> 01:04:36,829
去一根一根地咬她可爱的小指头

757
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:41,162
我叫特里斯顿・索朗
My name is Tristan Thorn.

758
01:04:41,472 --> 01:04:43,997
她是我妻子，亚伊尼　　　你妻子？
-This is my wife, Yvaine. -Your wife?

759
01:04:44,675 --> 01:04:48,372
这么年轻闪亮，却只嫁了一个男人
Far too young and radiant to belong to just one man!

760
01:04:48,746 --> 01:04:52,614
在我的船上，东西是要分享的，小家伙！
It's share and share alike aboard my vessel, sonny boy!

761
01:04:54,152 --> 01:04:55,141
如果你敢碰它…
If you dare even touch her...

762
01:04:55,253 --> 01:04:57,949
你自以为是在女友面前显示勇气吗
You may think you're showing a little spirit in front of your Iady friend,

763
01:04:58,056 --> 01:05:00,889
如果你再顶嘴，我就把你舌头拿去喂狗
but if you talk back to me again, I'll feed your tongue to the dogs,

764
01:05:00,992 --> 01:05:03,051
你这个卤莽的傻小子！
you impertinent little pup!

765
01:05:03,961 --> 01:05:06,828
先生？　　好点了！但不要打断我说话！
-Sir? -Better! But still interrupting.

766
01:05:06,931 --> 01:05:10,765
让我们看看，绞刑对鼓舞士气很有好处！
Let's see. A hanging's always good for morale!

767
01:05:10,868 --> 01:05:13,359
也许我们会让你跳一段绞架舞！
Maybe we'll watch you dance a gallows jig!

768
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:19,399
或者我直接把你掉过来头撞地完事！
Or perhaps I'll just tip you over the side and have done with it!

769
01:05:20,144 --> 01:05:22,044
下地狱了还有很长的路要走
It's a very Iong way down.

770
01:05:22,146 --> 01:05:25,547
你有足够的时间去回忆你痛苦短暂的一生
PIenty of time to reminisce about your pitifully short lives.

771
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:28,585
求你，我们只不过是想回到家乡
PIease, Iook, we're just trying to make our way home,

772
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:30,017
就是叫石墙的地方，我从那来的
back to a place called Wall, where I come from.

773
01:05:30,121 --> 01:05:31,645
你说什么？
What did you say?

774
01:05:31,756 --> 01:05:33,849
我说我们只想回家到石墙那儿去
I said we were trying to get home to Wall.

775
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,858
你在说谎，我的孩子
That's one lie too many, my son.

776
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:36,927
石墙　　　闭嘴
-Wall? -Shut up.

777
01:05:37,028 --> 01:05:37,995
他在说什么？
What's he saying?

778
01:05:38,096 --> 01:05:40,997
你以为你可以在我的地盘撒野，是吗？
Thought you could just wander onto my patch, did you?

779
01:05:41,099 --> 01:05:42,532
是的，他要…　　活着讲故事？
-He is. Yeah, he's gonna... -And live to tell the tale?

780
01:05:42,633 --> 01:05:45,124
好了，走，上甲板去…现在，走…
All right, go, on the deck, on the deck, on the deck! Now, go, go, go!

781
01:05:45,236 --> 01:05:49,673
你错了，索朗先生！最后一个你说不出来的！
Big mistake, Mr. Thorn! And the Iast one you'll ever make!

782
01:05:56,948 --> 01:05:59,815
不！不！你个畜生！　　来…来吧！
-No! No! You brute! -Come... Come on!

783
01:05:59,917 --> 01:06:03,045
你是杀人犯，你是猪！　　快！起来…
-You murderer! You pig! -Come on! Get up! Get up!

784
01:06:04,489 --> 01:06:06,753
我要把女孩带到我船舱里去，照我说的做
I'm taking the girl to my cabin, and mark my words,

785
01:06:06,858 --> 01:06:08,587
接下来几个小时打扰我的人…
anyone who disturbs me for the next few hours

786
01:06:08,693 --> 01:06:10,558
会和她一样！　　什么？你要…
-will get the same treatment! -What? You'll...

787
01:06:10,661 --> 01:06:13,289
不，你个蠢货！我会把你也吊起来
No, you idiot! I'll sling you over the side as well!

788
01:06:13,397 --> 01:06:14,659
哦，好的
Oh, yeah.

789
01:06:19,003 --> 01:06:21,369
船长很忙，所以你们应该…
Captain's busy. So should you be.

790
01:06:23,007 --> 01:06:24,770
进去，荡妇！
Get in there, wench!

791
01:06:30,848 --> 01:06:33,476
所以，我觉得演得不错
So, that went well, I thought.

792
01:06:34,318 --> 01:06:38,584
现在，告诉我有关我心爱英格兰的消息
Now, tell me news of my beloved England.

793
01:06:38,689 --> 01:06:41,283
那儿的一切我都想知道
I want to hear absolutely everything.

794
01:06:42,593 --> 01:06:45,585
等等，我不敢相信，你的船员就那样掉下去
Hang on. I can't believe your crew fell for that.

795
01:06:45,696 --> 01:06:48,130
天啊！你是从哪变出那么一具人体模型来的
And where in God's name did you get that mannequin from?

796
01:06:48,232 --> 01:06:49,927
哦，总是这样的
Oh, it works every time.

797
01:06:50,034 --> 01:06:52,264
和船员小商量一下，来一点计谋
An ounce of bargaining, a pinch of trickery,

798
01:06:52,370 --> 01:06:54,895
再稍稍威胁他们一下
a soupcon of intimidation, et voila!

799
01:06:55,006 --> 01:06:57,099
想获得杰出声望
The perfect recipe for a towering reputation

800
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,676
又不用流一滴血，这就是最好办法
without ever having to spill one drop of blood.

801
01:06:59,777 --> 01:07:03,178
试过把血渍从丝衫上洗掉吗？简直是恶梦
Ever try to get blood stains out of a silk shirt? Nightmare.

802
01:07:03,281 --> 01:07:06,739
是啊，我还是不明白为什么他们没认出我来
Right. I still don't understand how they won't recognize me.

803
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:07,840
特里斯顿，亲爱的孩子，化完妆后
Tristan, dear boy, when I'm done,

804
01:07:07,952 --> 01:07:08,919
连你妈也不会认出你来
your own mother won't recognize you.

805
01:07:09,020 --> 01:07:10,009
我们没有多少时间了
Now, we've no time to waste.

806
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:11,986
我们只剩两小时时间到达港口
We have only two hours before we make port.

807
01:07:12,089 --> 01:07:13,784
首要的事情
First and foremost...

808
01:07:17,461 --> 01:07:21,056
能看到你们脱掉一身旧衣服就再好不过了
It'll be so good to see you out of those dreary clothes.

809
01:07:21,165 --> 01:07:24,430
所以，荒良偏僻小城的男仆
So very small-town errand-boy. Howlingly parochial.

810
01:07:26,170 --> 01:07:28,365
来，穿上试试
Here. Tres you.

811
01:07:29,006 --> 01:07:31,668
都是我年轻时穿的，我一直留着
I wore it as a younger man. I hate to throw anything away.

812
01:07:31,776 --> 01:07:33,368
你穿衣服那一刻，它们又会流行起来
You know the day you do, it'll come back in fashion,

813
01:07:33,477 --> 01:07:35,377
就又成为时尚
be oh, so de la mode-

814
01:07:35,479 --> 01:07:36,878
至于你，亲爱的
Now, you, darling.

815
01:07:36,981 --> 01:07:38,676
我也有些适合你的，自己挑吧
I have some Iovely dresses. Take your pick.

816
01:07:38,783 --> 01:07:40,250
哦，是吗，我不用
Oh, no, really, I'm fine.

817
01:07:40,351 --> 01:07:42,717
宝贝，你穿着一件浴袍到处跑
Honey, you're wearing a bathrobe.

818
01:07:44,689 --> 01:07:48,352
英格兰，英格兰，我想知道你的一切
Now, England, England. I want to hear everything.

819
01:07:49,093 --> 01:07:51,288
你不是英格兰人　　　很不幸，不是…
-You're not from England. -Oh, no, sadly, no.

820
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:53,693
我年轻时就听说过那里的故事
But from my earliest youth, I Iapped up the stories.

821
01:07:53,798 --> 01:07:55,527
人们告诉我，都只不过是些民间传说
People always told me they were nothing more than folklore,

822
01:07:55,633 --> 01:07:58,124
我的内心却告诉我那些传说是真的
but my heart told me they were true.

823
01:07:58,236 --> 01:08:00,431
我还是个孩子时，便从父亲身边跑掉
As a boy, I'd scurry away from my father at the market

824
01:08:00,538 --> 01:08:03,405
父亲就为了看看石墙里面，去和人做交易
while he did his deals just to peek over the wall,

825
01:08:03,507 --> 01:08:06,499
我梦想着有一天能穿过石墙，亲眼看看英格兰
dream of, perhaps, crossing it one day, seeing England for myself.

826
01:08:06,611 --> 01:08:09,011
真的？所以你人在这儿，心里却想着那儿
Really? So you... You were here Iooking over there.

827
01:08:09,113 --> 01:08:10,341
是的
Oh, yes.

828
01:08:11,882 --> 01:08:14,248
头发　　　头发？
-Hair. -Hair?

829
01:08:15,453 --> 01:08:17,751
你知道吗，我尽力来扮演我的角色
Mind you, I did my best to fit in.

830
01:08:17,855 --> 01:08:20,119
以我父亲“魔鬼制造者”船长为荣耀
Tried to make my father, Captain Ghostmaker, proud.

831
01:08:20,224 --> 01:08:22,624
用冷血无情的杀戮
Forged a decent reputation as a ruthless marauder

832
01:08:22,727 --> 01:08:24,695
来树立自己正义的形象
and cold-blooded killer.

833
01:08:25,096 --> 01:08:26,825
我父亲却死去了
But my father died.

834
01:08:27,632 --> 01:08:29,827
我对他承诺，我会接管家族事业
I always promised him I'd take over the family business,

835
01:08:29,934 --> 01:08:31,902
老女人也得保有活力
keep the old girl flying.

836
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:34,837
你们知道，能一吐心扉我多开心吗？
You have no idea the lightness it brings to my heart

837
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:37,965
能对可爱的年轻人说出真心话
being able to confide in you charming young people.

838
01:08:38,075 --> 01:08:40,507
为了船员们，我又得扮演莎士比亚船长
The pressure of maintaining the whole Captain Shakespeare persona

839
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:42,502
压力之大，我不知道该怎么说
for the sake of the crew, I don't know.

840
01:08:42,613 --> 01:08:44,137
有时…
Sometimes...

841
01:08:44,248 --> 01:08:47,217
知道吗，我是自己塑造自己的一类人
You see, I'm very much a man of my own creation.

842
01:08:47,318 --> 01:08:50,185
特别是叫这名字之后，几十年苦心经营它
Even chose the name specially. Took me ages.

843
01:08:50,288 --> 01:08:52,381
当我心里想着英国传奇语言艺术家时
See, I'm thinking Iegendary British wordsmith.

844
01:08:52,490 --> 01:08:55,516
我的船员和敌人们却想着“砍人！戳矛！”
My enemies and crew are thinking, "Shake! Spear!"

845
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,321
谈起这些事能让我高兴点
It's little things like that make me happy.

846
01:08:58,663 --> 01:09:00,722
我不明白
I don't understand that.

847
01:09:00,831 --> 01:09:03,629
想快乐点就应该做回你自己
Surely it would make you happier just to be yourself.

848
01:09:03,734 --> 01:09:05,033
你不想做这样的人，却为什么要…
Why fight to be accepted by people you don't actually want to be like?

849
01:09:05,044 --> 01:09:07,133
如此辛苦地让人们接受你成为这样的人？

850
01:09:07,138 --> 01:09:10,164
是啊，谁会这样对待自己？
Yeah. Why would anyone do that to himself?

851
01:09:11,475 --> 01:09:12,703
确实是
Exactly.

852
01:09:15,813 --> 01:09:19,647
嘿，港口，准备好桶装酒迎接我们！
Port ahoy! Ready the lightning barrels!

853
01:09:33,431 --> 01:09:34,693
快点
Hurry up.

854
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:46,642
对，看起来不算很奇特，我会说实价的
Yeah. Doesn't seem very fresh. I'll be honest.

855
01:09:46,744 --> 01:09:48,769
想体验一下它吗？年轻的费迪南得？
Shall I give you a little taste, young Ferdinand?

856
01:09:48,879 --> 01:09:50,642
不，不用，哦，看这个
No, no. Oh, there you go.

857
01:09:53,250 --> 01:09:54,979
绚丽！不过还是廉价货
Brilliant. Like they're cheap.

858
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:59,022
我认为这玩意异常活跃，也很奇特
I think it's still crackling, very much alive, still tres fresh.

859
01:09:59,323 --> 01:10:01,917
那开个好价吧　　　一万个螺栓的价？
-So, name your best price. -For 10,000 bolts?

860
01:10:02,026 --> 01:10:04,460
A等品的一万个螺栓吗？
Ten thousand bolts of finest quality grade A.

861
01:10:04,562 --> 01:10:07,429
是的，但这玩意还不好挪放
Yeah, but it's difficult to shift, isn't it? Difficult to store.

862
01:10:07,531 --> 01:10:10,762
如果被嗅觉灵敏的收税人看到了
If I get the Revenue Men in here sniffing round, what's the...

863
01:10:10,868 --> 01:10:12,631
给你个最好的价，150镑
Best price, 150 guineas.

864
01:10:13,204 --> 01:10:15,069
伙计们，把货放回船上准备起航
Gentlemen, put the merchandise back onboard and prepare to sail.
Gentlemen, put the merchandise back onboard and prepare to sail.

865
01:10:15,172 --> 01:10:16,469
哦…　　费迪南得，交谈愉快
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. -Ferdinand, always a pleasure.

866
01:10:16,607 --> 01:10:18,336
等等，等等，一分钟，等等，亲爱的
Hold on. Hold on. One minute. Hold on, cuddles.

867
01:10:18,442 --> 01:10:20,307
160镑，160镑
-Oh, he's... -One-sixty. One-sixty.

868
01:10:20,411 --> 01:10:22,345
你知道我今天特别的慷慨
Seeing as I'm feeling particularly generous today,

869
01:10:22,446 --> 01:10:23,708
200镑更很合适点
I'll settle for 200.

870
01:10:23,814 --> 01:10:26,840
200镑？好吧，你在开玩笑？
Two hundred? Okay. You're having a Iaugh.

871
01:10:26,951 --> 01:10:28,213
你把头插在这里面过吗？
Have you had your head in that?

872
01:10:28,319 --> 01:10:31,379
还是呆在空气稀薄的地方太久了？
Has he been sailing up where the air's too thin?

873
01:10:32,890 --> 01:10:35,484
你说话很粗鲁　　　我不说了
-You're being very rude. -Not anymore.

874
01:10:36,660 --> 01:10:38,423
200镑　　　180镑
-Two hundred. -One-eighty.

875
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:39,962
200镑　　　谈判不是这样的
-Two hundred. -That's not negotiation.

876
01:10:40,064 --> 01:10:42,362
我改变价格吧
I'm changing my number. One-eight-five.

877
01:10:42,466 --> 01:10:44,900
我听到的是200吗？　　那是你嘴里说的
-Did I hear 200? -From you, you did. Yeah.

878
01:10:45,002 --> 01:10:47,800
你说的200　　　我说的？那你就是口技演员
-You said 200. -If I did, you're a ventriloquist.

879
01:10:47,905 --> 01:10:49,964
好吧，195镑，最后出价
Okay, one-nine-five. Final offer.

880
01:10:50,341 --> 01:10:54,402
是195镑，加上成交税，那就是200
One-nine-five it is. So, with sales tax, that's, Iet's see, 200.

881
01:10:54,512 --> 01:10:56,707
算你狠，拿到后面去吧
Brilliant. Put it in the back.

882
01:10:57,114 --> 01:10:59,275
难以置信，来
Unbelievable. Here.

883
01:11:04,755 --> 01:11:06,484
有事吗？要我帮忙吗？
Yes? Can I help you?

884
01:11:08,526 --> 01:11:09,618
管闲事
Nosy.

885
01:11:10,094 --> 01:11:13,325
你在附近听说过坠落流星的传言吗？
Have you heard any of these rumors going round about a fallen star?

886
01:11:13,431 --> 01:11:14,830
人人都在谈论这个
Everyone's talking about it.

887
01:11:14,932 --> 01:11:18,231
能找到那些星星的话，就可以退休养老了
You get your hands on one of them, we can shut up shop. Retire.

888
01:11:18,335 --> 01:11:20,030
坠落的流星？　　是啊
-Fallen star? -Yeah.

889
01:11:26,076 --> 01:11:27,771
旅行时没听说过？　　没有
-Nothing on your travels? -No.

890
01:11:27,878 --> 01:11:29,106
一点传闻都没听到过？
Not even a little sniff of a whisper?

891
01:11:29,213 --> 01:11:30,908
市场里人人都在谈论这个？
Everyone's going on about it down at the market.

892
01:11:31,015 --> 01:11:32,277
哪个市场？石墙附近的市场吗？
Which market? The market near the wall?

893
01:11:32,383 --> 01:11:33,350
是的
Yeah.

894
01:11:33,451 --> 01:11:35,214
费迪，市场里总有些池塘浮渣交易
Well, Ferdy, you're wasting your time listening to gossip

895
01:11:35,319 --> 01:11:37,253
去听这些流言蜚语是浪费时间
from the kind of pond scum trading down there.

896
01:11:37,354 --> 01:11:39,686
哦，我的嘴巴，在这乱说
-Well, if it... -Oh, my word! Speak of the devil.

897
01:11:39,790 --> 01:11:41,519
哦，是吗？那你们在说什么？
Oh, yeah? What were you saying, then?

898
01:11:41,625 --> 01:11:43,923
我在说你是多么能干的主妇啊，莎尔
Oh, what a wonderful woman you are, Sal.

899
01:11:44,028 --> 01:11:45,723
没有你世界就完全是另一个样子了
How the world wouldn't be the same place without you.

900
01:11:45,830 --> 01:11:47,491
你气色不错，你把脚弄好了，是吧？
You Iook great. You've had your feet done, haven't you?

901
01:11:47,598 --> 01:11:51,694
但你们俩有事要谈吧，莎尔，费迪，再见
But, you two, you have business to attend to. Sal. Ferdy. Good day.

902
01:11:51,802 --> 01:11:54,498
走吧，我有新东西给你看
Come on. I've got something new for you.

903
01:12:01,178 --> 01:12:02,907
莎士比亚船长
Captain Shakespeare.

904
01:12:03,314 --> 01:12:04,611
停战！
Stand down!

905
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,410
认识下我的外甥，可怕的海盗
Meet my nephew, the fearsome buccaneer,

906
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:08,007
特里斯顿・索朗
Tristan Thorn.

907
01:12:08,352 --> 01:12:10,877
他将加入我们返回老家的旅程
He'll be joining us for our journey home.

908
01:12:10,988 --> 01:12:14,389
我送你个礼物，让你在路上玩得开心
I have the perfect gift to keep you amused on the way.

909
01:12:21,265 --> 01:12:22,289
哦
Oh...

910
01:12:28,606 --> 01:12:30,073
右边，大懒狗！
Right, you Iazy dogs!

911
01:12:30,174 --> 01:12:32,836
让我们带着年轻的特里斯顿回家吧
Let's get young Tristan on his way home!

912
01:14:25,055 --> 01:14:26,249
不赖嘛
Touche.

913
01:14:26,924 --> 01:14:28,414
给我印象深刻
I'm impressed.

914
01:14:44,375 --> 01:14:46,468
亚伊尼，我知道你是什么
Yvaine, I know what you are.

915
01:14:48,812 --> 01:14:51,804
不，不，别害怕
No, no. Have no fear.

916
01:14:52,316 --> 01:14:54,080
这里没人会伤害你
No one on this vessel will harm you, but there are plenty who would.

917
01:14:54,096 --> 01:14:56,880
但其他地方有很多人想伤害你

918
01:14:59,890 --> 01:15:01,921
你的不安情绪流露出来，亚伊尼
Your emotions give you away, Yvaine. You must Iearn to control them.

919
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,621
你得学会控制才行

920
01:15:03,727 --> 01:15:06,025
每天你都不断变得更加光亮
You've been glowing more brightly every day,

921
01:15:06,130 --> 01:15:07,563
我想你知道为什么会这样
and I think you know why.

922
01:15:07,665 --> 01:15:10,429
我当然知道我为什么变得光亮，我是颗星星
Of course I know why I'm glowing. I'm a star.

923
01:15:10,601 --> 01:15:14,560
星星最擅长什么？　　当然不是跳华尔兹了
-And what do stars do best? -Well, it's certainly not the waltz.

924
01:15:25,749 --> 01:15:27,011
再试试　　　好的
-Now try. -Okay.

925
01:15:30,487 --> 01:15:32,216
看到了吗？　　非常好
-See? -Very good.

926
01:15:47,504 --> 01:15:48,903
你说正西方吗？
Due west, you say?

927
01:15:49,006 --> 01:15:50,337
你确定还有个女孩和他在一起？
And you're certain he had a girl with him?

928
01:15:50,441 --> 01:15:51,430
是的
Yeah.

929
01:15:51,542 --> 01:15:54,841
你确定？完全肯定？确定你没有撒谎？
You're sure? Absolutely sure? Sure you're not Iying?

930
01:15:55,345 --> 01:15:57,643
如果撒谎我会在胸口划十字
I'd cross my heart if I had one.

931
01:15:58,982 --> 01:16:00,609
漂亮　　　你最好说的是实话
-Brilliant. -You'd better be telling the truth,

932
01:16:00,718 --> 01:16:01,980
你这个双面狗
you two-faced dog.

933
01:16:02,086 --> 01:16:05,055
其实你可以给自己弄一只很好的看门狗
I can get you one of them, actually. Very good guard dogs.

934
01:16:05,155 --> 01:16:07,316
他们可以同时看到前方和背后
They can watch the back and the front door at the same time.

935
01:16:07,424 --> 01:16:08,391
我要什么我都可以给你
I can get you anything you want.

936
01:16:08,492 --> 01:16:11,154
我得到巴比伦蜡烛的机率是多少？
What are the chances of getting a Babylon candle?

937
01:16:11,261 --> 01:16:12,694
那个机率不大
That one's slim.

938
01:16:12,796 --> 01:16:15,256
尽管这样，我还是认识一个女孩
AIthough, I did know a girl once, if you know what I mean...

939
01:16:15,276 --> 01:16:17,256
如果你知道我是说谁的话…

940
01:16:17,367 --> 01:16:18,459
我喜欢追女人
I'm a Iadies' man.

941
01:16:18,569 --> 01:16:19,968
这女孩有个姐姐
...who had a sister...

942
01:16:20,070 --> 01:16:21,128
我想应该是个妇女
I think it was a woman.

943
01:16:21,238 --> 01:16:23,229
哦，她看起来很可怕
Oh, she was terrible. Face like a bag of frogs. Ugly frogs.

944
01:16:23,248 --> 01:16:24,969
青蛙一般的脸，丑陋的青蛙

945
01:16:25,075 --> 01:16:26,269
够了
Enough.

946
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:46,290
抓紧了，船长在掌舵
Hold on tight! The Captain's at the helm!

947
01:17:38,816 --> 01:17:41,546
那边就是通向石墙的路
So there's the road you'll need for Wall.

948
01:17:41,652 --> 01:17:45,144
无论回家的旅程将会怎样，祝你一路顺风
Good Iuck on your journey home, Yvaine, wherever that may be.

949
01:17:45,255 --> 01:17:48,224
祝你和维多利亚好运
And good Iuck to you, Tristan, with your Victoria.

950
01:17:48,992 --> 01:17:50,823
我该怎么回报你的好意呢？
Oh, how can we ever thank you enough for your kindness?

951
01:17:50,928 --> 01:17:54,523
别这么说，说真的，别提它
Don't mention it. No, seriously, don't mention it.

952
01:17:54,631 --> 01:17:56,158
你知道名声这东西吗？
Reputations, you know. A lifetime to build, seconds to destroy.

953
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,958
用一生的时间去建立，片刻就可以毁掉

954
01:18:01,071 --> 01:18:04,006
哦，特里斯顿，记住…
Oh, and Tristan, just remember...

955
01:18:07,177 --> 01:18:08,940
好好去想想
Just think about it.

956
01:18:12,749 --> 01:18:15,128
那么，帮我带去给英格兰的问候
Well, give my regards to England. It's been a pleasure to meet you both.

957
01:18:15,149 --> 01:18:17,118
见到你们两位是我的荣幸

958
01:18:20,591 --> 01:18:23,856
别让那荡妇累着了，特里斯顿船长！
Mind you don't wear that wench out, Captain Tristan!

959
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:30,465
他对你说了什么？
What did he say to you?

960
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:32,629
他什么时候说什么了？
What did he say when?

961
01:18:32,736 --> 01:18:35,227
就是他和你说悄悄话的时候
Just then. When he whispered to you.

962
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,140
不…他…就说我们应该利用闪电
No... No, he... He was just saying we should use the lightning

963
01:18:39,243 --> 01:18:41,473
来给你做个巴比伦蜡烛
to get you a Babylon candle.

964
01:18:41,578 --> 01:18:43,512
以物换物，你知道吗
Barter for it, you know.

965
01:18:44,715 --> 01:18:48,276
最后说一遍，那女孩在哪？
For the Iast time, where is the girl?

966
01:18:49,653 --> 01:18:52,417
带着宝石的女孩！她去哪了？
The girl with the stone! Where did she go?

967
01:18:53,523 --> 01:18:55,650
你在嘲笑我吗？　　不
-Are you mocking me? -No...

968
01:18:55,759 --> 01:18:59,751
相信我，如果你嘲笑我，你小命就只有几秒了！
'Cause if you are, believe me, you have seconds to live!

969
01:19:04,234 --> 01:19:05,667
这只怪物
What a freak.

970
01:19:06,003 --> 01:19:08,528
清洗干净，彻底点
CIean this thoroughly.

971
01:19:16,747 --> 01:19:18,044
小公牛
Bollocks.

972
01:19:20,317 --> 01:19:23,013
如果你不把魔法浪费在让你变美
If you have quite finished squandering your magic

973
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,611
这种不可能的事情上
on your rather counterproductive beauty routine,

974
01:19:25,722 --> 01:19:27,986
你应该会知道星星已经回来了
you might like to know that the star has returned.

975
01:19:28,091 --> 01:19:29,456
她回到地面了
She's back on Iand.

976
01:19:29,559 --> 01:19:32,926
我知道，该死的，我没能及时赶到湖泊那
I know, damn it. I couldn't reach the Iake in time.

977
01:19:33,030 --> 01:19:35,399
没关系，我们已经找到她了
No matter. We have found her. She is on the road to the village of Wall.

978
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:37,399
她在去石墙村庄的路上

979
01:19:37,501 --> 01:19:40,026
如果你走近路穿过沼泽
If you take the shortcut across the marshes,

980
01:19:40,137 --> 01:19:42,002
你应该可以及时赶到并拦截住她
you should arrive in time to intercept her.

981
01:19:50,981 --> 01:19:52,209
亚伊尼
Yvaine.

982
01:19:56,053 --> 01:19:58,146
你又想把我的腿摔断吗？　　对不起…
-Are you trying to break my Ieg again? -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

983
01:19:58,255 --> 01:20:01,190
我只是不想让人看到你，我不信任何人
I just... I can't risk people seeing you. I don't trust anyone.

984
01:20:01,291 --> 01:20:02,952
但现在的速度，如果我们老是停下…
But at this rate, if we keep stopping...

985
01:20:03,060 --> 01:20:08,020
亚伊尼，我们一起很快乐，就等一会
Yvaine. We're making good time. Just Ieave it a minute.

986
01:20:15,005 --> 01:20:16,734
你不是被吸引住了吧？
Aren't you tempted?

987
01:20:19,843 --> 01:20:21,572
吸引？被什么吸引了？
Tempted? By what?

988
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,779
永恒的生命
Immortality.

989
01:20:25,816 --> 01:20:27,681
我希望不是我的心
Let's say it wasn't my heart.

990
01:20:28,251 --> 01:20:31,550
不是我，我只是一颗无名的星星
Not me. Just a star you didn't know.

991
01:20:33,256 --> 01:20:35,952
你真的认为我会杀人吗？
You seriously think I could kill anyone?

992
01:20:40,063 --> 01:20:44,432
我是说，为了得到永恒生命？
I mean, even if I could... Everlasting life?

993
01:20:46,570 --> 01:20:49,130
我想那样我反倒会孤独
I imagine it would be kind of Ionely.

994
01:20:51,375 --> 01:20:52,467
所以
Well,

995
01:20:54,277 --> 01:20:57,041
如果可以和一个人，一个你爱的人
maybe if you had someone to share it with.

996
01:20:58,215 --> 01:20:59,807
去分享那份生命
Someone you Iove.

997
01:21:00,217 --> 01:21:02,617
那可能就不一样了
Maybe then it might be different.

998
01:21:05,822 --> 01:21:07,949
来吧，我想现在安全了
Come on, I think we're safe.

999
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:33,777
记住，莎士比亚船长有个非常可怕的名声
Now remember, Captain Shakespeare has a fearsome reputation.

1000
01:23:02,038 --> 01:23:04,632
这是怎么回事？　　你进来干什么？
-What the hell is this? -What are you doing here?

1001
01:23:04,741 --> 01:23:06,834
我的是塞普蒂默斯王子
My name is Prince Septimus.

1002
01:23:08,078 --> 01:23:10,842
你来告诉我那女孩在哪
And you're going to tell me where I can find the girl.

1003
01:23:18,155 --> 01:23:23,559
好了，光脚丫，我数三下，一、二…
All right, twinkletoes. I'm gonna count to three. One, two...

1004
01:23:39,805 --> 01:23:42,069
你知道，你有时闪闪发光的
You know, you sort of glitter sometimes. I just noticed it. Is it normal?

1005
01:23:42,075 --> 01:23:44,469
我刚注意到，是正常现象吗？

1006
01:23:44,576 --> 01:23:47,670
你自己想想看
Let's see if you can work it out for yourself.

1007
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:49,576
星星会怎样？
What do stars do?

1008
01:23:51,149 --> 01:23:52,776
给人添麻烦吗？
Attract trouble?

1009
01:23:54,886 --> 01:23:57,184
好了，对不起，等等我，对不起
That's... All right, I'm sorry. Wait, I'm sorry.

1010
01:23:57,289 --> 01:23:59,847
好了，让我…让我…再猜猜
All right, Iet me... Let me... Do I get another guess?

1011
01:24:00,025 --> 01:24:01,552
星星知道怎么让一个…
Is it... Do they know exactly how to annoy a boy called Tristan Thorn?

1012
01:24:01,565 --> 01:24:04,852
叫特里斯顿・索朗的男孩烦恼吗？

1013
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:08,298
{\1c&H0DEAEA&}（ 距离石墙60英里 ）

1014
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:11,598
还有多远？　　可能要两天
-How Iong will that take? -Maybe two days.

1015
01:24:11,703 --> 01:24:15,934
但我们时间有限，明天是维多利亚的生日
But we don't have two days. Victoria's birthday is tomorrow.

1016
01:24:16,208 --> 01:24:19,302
是啊，记得真准啊
Yes, it is. Well remembered.

1017
01:24:25,817 --> 01:24:28,479
一杯美味的伯爵茶　　　出去，都出去
-Nice cup of Earl Grey. -Get out, everybody. Get out.

1018
01:24:28,587 --> 01:24:30,555
他伤到你了吗，船长？
Did he hurt you, Captain?

1019
01:24:32,257 --> 01:24:36,390
你告诉他…你外甥和那女孩去哪了吗？
Did you tell him where your nephew and the girl went?

1020
01:24:36,661 --> 01:24:38,492
那么到底出了什么问题？
So what's the problem?

1021
01:24:39,764 --> 01:24:41,459
是关于我的名声
It's my reputation.

1022
01:24:42,968 --> 01:24:45,232
不，不，别说傻话
No. No, no. Don't be silly. Nonsense.

1023
01:24:45,337 --> 01:24:47,168
没事的，船长
It's all right, Captain.

1024
01:24:47,906 --> 01:24:50,374
我们都知道你喜欢男人
We always knew you were a whoopsie.

1025
01:24:53,678 --> 01:24:57,375
你永远是我们的船长，船长　　　船长
-You'll always be our captain, Captain. -Aye, aye, Captain.

1026
01:25:02,854 --> 01:25:03,821
船长
Captain.

1027
01:25:03,922 --> 01:25:05,913
我们走，我们走
Yeah. Let's go, Iet's go.

1028
01:25:13,098 --> 01:25:14,963
塞普蒂默斯王子，你的部下都死了
Prince Septimus, your men, they're dead.

1029
01:25:15,066 --> 01:25:16,431
哦，真的吗？
Oh, really?

1030
01:25:18,336 --> 01:25:19,496
走
Go on!

1031
01:25:32,617 --> 01:25:35,484
我见过那个女人，她是船长的朋友
I met that woman. She's friends with the Captain.

1032
01:25:35,587 --> 01:25:37,282
他说她在石墙附近的市场做生意
He said she trades at the market near Wall.

1033
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:39,380
我们搭顺风车　　　真的？她是船长朋友？
-We could hitch a lift. -Really? She's a friend of the Captain's?

1034
01:25:39,491 --> 01:25:40,719
你确定？　　是的，是的
-You sure? -Yes, yes.

1035
01:25:41,593 --> 01:25:45,359
等等！对不起！我叫特里斯顿・索朗，她是…
Wait! Sorry! My name is Tristan Thorn. This...

1036
01:25:45,463 --> 01:25:47,090
那是我的花
That's my flower.

1037
01:25:47,832 --> 01:25:50,892
18年了，我一直在找她
Eighteen years I've been Iooking for that.

1038
01:25:51,002 --> 01:25:52,629
快给我！
Give it to me now!

1039
01:25:53,371 --> 01:25:56,431
你怎么敢？那是她妈妈给她的礼物！
How dare you? That was a gift from his mother!

1040
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:57,508
哦
Oh.

1041
01:25:58,076 --> 01:25:59,941
我可能误解了
Perhaps I was mistaken.

1042
01:26:01,246 --> 01:26:02,770
没事
It's all right.

1043
01:26:03,315 --> 01:26:05,408
它对你显然很有价值，我可以给你
It's obviously very valuable to you, so you can have it

1044
01:26:05,517 --> 01:26:07,041
帮我个忙以作为交换
in exchange for what I need.

1045
01:26:07,152 --> 01:26:09,211
给我巴比伦蜡烛？　　护送我们去石墙
-A Babylon candle? -And safe passage to the wall.

1046
01:26:09,321 --> 01:26:11,152
巴比伦蜡烛？
A Babylon candle?

1047
01:26:11,256 --> 01:26:15,192
哦，不，不…我不和黑暗魔法打交道
Oh, no, no, no. I don't deal in black magic.

1048
01:26:15,293 --> 01:26:16,487
是吗？
Really?

1049
01:26:17,128 --> 01:26:19,596
那你能送我们一程去石墙吗？
Well, can you give us a lift then? To the wall?

1050
01:26:19,698 --> 01:26:22,724
你怎么不早说？
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?

1051
01:26:24,769 --> 01:26:27,533
为了那朵花，我可以送你一程
For that flower, I can offer you passage.

1052
01:26:27,806 --> 01:26:29,967
路上需要食宿吗？　　旅程安全就行
-Food and Iodging on the way? -Safe passage.

1053
01:26:30,075 --> 01:26:32,407
我发誓，你会象现在这个样子
I swear that you will arrive at the wall

1054
01:26:32,510 --> 01:26:35,570
安全到达石墙
in the exact same condition that you're in now.

1055
01:26:41,186 --> 01:26:43,780
你知道这花是什么东西吗？
Do you have any idea what manner of thing it was that you had?

1056
01:26:43,888 --> 01:26:45,879
某种幸运的魔法？
Some kind of Iucky charm?

1057
01:26:46,358 --> 01:26:49,589
一个好运的防护魔法
A very Iucky charm indeed. Protection.

1058
01:26:50,428 --> 01:26:55,195
实际上，为了防护，我本不想这么做
In fact, the exact same thing that would've prevented me from doing this.

1059
01:26:59,604 --> 01:27:02,300
哦，天那，你干了什么？　　好多了
-Oh, my God! What did you do? -Much better.

1060
01:27:02,407 --> 01:27:06,207
你不能看她，碰她，嗅她，听她
You shall not see the star, touch it, smell or hear it-

1061
01:27:06,578 --> 01:27:10,105
我会遵守诺言，你不会受到伤害
Though I'll keep me word. You shall not be harmed.

1062
01:27:19,057 --> 01:27:22,652
去那里面，食宿就和我保证的一样
There. Food and Iodging just as I promised.

1063
01:27:22,761 --> 01:27:26,891
你既看不见我，也听不到我，我说的对吗？
Would I be correct in thinking that you can neither see nor hear me?

1064
01:27:27,332 --> 01:27:30,028
我想告诉你，你身上一股尿味
Then I'd like to tell you that you smell of pee.

1065
01:27:30,135 --> 01:27:31,898
你看起来象个卑鄙小人
You Iook like the wrong end of a dog.

1066
01:27:32,003 --> 01:27:34,471
我发誓，如果特里斯顿变不回去
And I swear, if I don't get my Tristan back as he was,

1067
01:27:34,572 --> 01:27:36,733
我做鬼也要永远缠着你
I'll be your personal poltergeist!

1068
01:27:44,833 --> 01:27:46,298
{\1c&H0DEAEA&}（ 距离石墙60英里 ）

1069
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,154
特里斯顿？
Tristan?

1070
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:01,528
如果你能听懂我说话，请看着我
If you can understand me, Iook at me now.

1071
01:28:30,061 --> 01:28:34,053
你知道吗，当我说…我不懂爱情的时候
You know when I said I knew little about Iove?

1072
01:28:34,799 --> 01:28:36,699
那不是真的
Well, that wasn't true.

1073
01:28:39,237 --> 01:28:41,171
关于爱情我知道很多
I know a Iot about Iove.

1074
01:28:41,940 --> 01:28:45,376
我看到过了，看了几百年了
I've seen it. I've seen centuries and centuries of it.

1075
01:28:47,178 --> 01:28:51,137
唯一能支撑我继续看着人类世界的就是爱
And it was the only thing that made watching your world bearable.

1076
01:28:52,350 --> 01:28:57,811
所有的战争、痛苦、谎言、仇恨
All those wars. Pain and lies. Hate.

1077
01:28:59,958 --> 01:29:03,257
这些东西让我想转过头去，不再往下看
Made me want to turn away and never Iook down again.

1078
01:29:05,397 --> 01:29:09,197
我就是来看人类是如何爱的
But to see the way that mankind Ioves.

1079
01:29:10,402 --> 01:29:13,132
我是说，你可以到遥远世界的深处去寻找
I mean, you could search the furthest reaches of the universe

1080
01:29:13,238 --> 01:29:16,071
却找不到比爱更美的东西
and never find anything more beautiful.

1081
01:29:18,977 --> 01:29:24,381
所以，是的，我知道爱是无条件的
So, yes, I know that Iove is unconditional.

1082
01:29:26,017 --> 01:29:29,817
但我也知道爱是不可预知的
But I also know it can be unpredictable,

1083
01:29:30,789 --> 01:29:36,421
无法预料的，无发控制的，无法忍受的
unexpected, uncontrollable, unbearable

1084
01:29:38,396 --> 01:29:42,492
奇怪的是，爱很容易被错认为是憎恶
and, well, strangely easy to mistake for Ioathing.

1085
01:29:43,268 --> 01:29:44,235
And

1086
01:29:46,604 --> 01:29:51,007
特里斯顿 我想说的是…
what I'm trying to say, Tristan, is

1087
01:29:52,677 --> 01:29:54,406
我认为我爱上你了
I think I Iove you.

1088
01:29:55,513 --> 01:30:01,213
我的身体几乎不能容纳我的心了
My heart, it feels like my chest can barely contain it.

1089
01:30:03,054 --> 01:30:08,492
好象它不再属于我了，而是属于你
Like it doesn't belong to me anymore. It belongs to you.

1090
01:30:10,028 --> 01:30:14,260
如果你要的话，我会无偿地给你
And if you wanted it, I'd wish for nothing in exchange.

1091
01:30:15,567 --> 01:30:17,927
不需要礼物，不需要商品
No gifts, no goods, no demonstrations of devotion.

1092
01:30:17,947 --> 01:30:20,527
不必让我看到你所投入的

1093
01:30:23,575 --> 01:30:26,169
什么都不需要，我只要你也爱我
Nothing but knowing you Iove me, too.

1094
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:29,636
就是你的心…
Just your heart

1095
01:30:31,716 --> 01:30:33,411
换取我的心
in exchange for mine.

1096
01:30:42,894 --> 01:30:45,089
石墙在那个方向一里处
The wall is one mile that way.

1097
01:30:45,897 --> 01:30:49,594
尽管步行将花去比一般更长的时间
There. Though the walk might take you a little Ionger than normal.

1098
01:30:49,701 --> 01:30:53,797
变回原样，会使你头脑发晕一段时间
Transformation tends to Ieave the brain a bit scrambled for a while.

1099
01:30:57,275 --> 01:30:58,606
你…
You...

1100
01:30:58,843 --> 01:30:59,832
哦！
Oh!

1101
01:31:01,079 --> 01:31:03,445
我警告过你了，省点力气吧
I warned you. Save your strength.

1102
01:31:04,415 --> 01:31:06,679
我一直都在担心你
I've been so worried about you.

1103
01:31:07,352 --> 01:31:08,580
维多利亚
Victoria.

1104
01:31:09,621 --> 01:31:11,680
我宁愿你叫我“母亲”
I think I preferred "Mother."

1105
01:31:13,591 --> 01:31:15,553
来吧，那边有个客栈
Come on. There's an inn over there. Victoria's birthday's not till tomorrow.

1106
01:31:15,581 --> 01:31:18,153
维多利亚的生日要明天才到

1107
01:31:19,197 --> 01:31:20,664
你把我送给她之前
I think you need a bath and a good night's sleep

1108
01:31:20,765 --> 01:31:23,029
你需要洗个澡好好睡一觉
before you present me to her.

1109
01:31:23,134 --> 01:31:24,761
来吧，来
Come on. Come.

1110
01:31:27,138 --> 01:31:30,039
来吧，特里斯顿，不远了　　　好的
-Come on, Tristan. It's not that far. -Okay.

1111
01:31:51,563 --> 01:31:53,258
对不起？　　哦
-Excuse me? -Oh!

1112
01:31:53,364 --> 01:31:56,995
我认为你躺在我的浴室里了　　　闭上眼！
-I think you're in my bath. -Well, close your eyes!

1113
01:31:58,136 --> 01:32:00,566
我不是…老实说，我没有看
I'm not... Honestly, I'm not Iooking. Here, I'll turn away.

1114
01:32:00,576 --> 01:32:02,766
在这，我转过身了

1115
01:32:07,245 --> 01:32:09,611
好了，你可以睁开了
All right, you can open them now.

1116
01:32:17,355 --> 01:32:20,483
你在大篷车里说的都是真的吗？
Did you really mean what you said in the caravan?

1117
01:32:22,527 --> 01:32:23,789
我…
What I...

1118
01:32:23,895 --> 01:32:26,921
但是…你那时是只老鼠！
But... But you were a mouse!

1119
01:32:27,365 --> 01:32:30,528
你是只老鼠！你只想吃奶酪！你没有…
You were a mouse! You wanted cheese! You didn't...

1120
01:32:30,635 --> 01:32:32,466
我要你对我示意
I asked you to give me a sign.

1121
01:32:32,570 --> 01:32:36,734
说出如此富有爱意的话来，觉得不好意思了？
And risk you being too embarrassed to keep saying such Iovely things?

1122
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,641
你想知道船长真正对我说了些什么悄悄话吗？
You want to know what the Captain really whispered to me that day?

1123
01:32:47,986 --> 01:32:52,582
他告诉我，真爱就在我的眼前
He told me that my true Iove was right in front of my eyes.

1124
01:32:54,792 --> 01:32:56,419
他说的对
And he was right.

1125
01:33:11,209 --> 01:33:14,110
伙计们…过来！你们得看看这个
Hey, guys! Guys, come on! Come on, you got to come up and see this!

1126
01:33:14,212 --> 01:33:15,645
不，谢谢
No, thank you.

1127
01:33:16,381 --> 01:33:18,440
变态！　　随便你们
-Pervert! -Suit yourself.

1128
01:33:20,418 --> 01:33:23,819
有点讽刺，是吗？　　是啊，什么？
-Ironic, isn't it? -Yeah. What is?

1129
01:33:24,455 --> 01:33:26,514
塞普蒂默斯早上就会到这儿
Septimus will be here by the morning,

1130
01:33:26,624 --> 01:33:30,390
找到女孩，拿到宝石，永远成为国王
find the girl, get the stone and be king forever.

1131
01:33:30,495 --> 01:33:31,826
太不公平了
So unjust.

1132
01:33:32,430 --> 01:33:34,728
尽管这样，我们却自由了
Still, at Ieast we will be free.

1133
01:33:37,502 --> 01:33:40,835
你离她很近了，她就在镇集里
You're very close. She's in the market town.

1134
01:33:40,938 --> 01:33:43,236
离石墙缺口一英里处
One mile from the gap in the wall.

1135
01:33:43,341 --> 01:33:45,400
说起来好象是条好消息
You speak as if this is good news.

1136
01:33:45,510 --> 01:33:47,046
要我提醒你们吗？
Do I need to remind you that Wall is not part of our universe?

1137
01:33:47,060 --> 01:33:49,446
那堵墙不属于这个世界的一部分

1138
01:33:49,547 --> 01:33:52,107
如果她穿过石墙入口、进入人类领地
If she crosses the threshold into the human realm,

1139
01:33:52,216 --> 01:33:56,243
她只会变成一块泛着金属光泽的石头
our star becomes nothing more than a pitted Iump of metallic rock.

1140
01:33:56,754 --> 01:33:59,154
那么我建议你快点！
Then I suggest you hurry up!

1141
01:34:30,321 --> 01:34:31,481
什么？
What?

1142
01:34:32,490 --> 01:34:33,650
哦，你要什么？
Oh, what do you want?

1143
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:36,886
对不起，能给我一张纸和一只笔吗？
Sorry. Can I have a piece of paper and a pen?

1144
01:34:36,994 --> 01:34:39,861
在合适的时间再来问我
Ask me again at a more reasonable hour.

1145
01:34:39,964 --> 01:34:41,056
不，不行，我得走了
No, I can't. I have to go.

1146
01:34:41,165 --> 01:34:43,395
我回来前如果我的朋友醒了
Look, if my friend wakes up before I get back,

1147
01:34:43,501 --> 01:34:46,969
请你帮我带个口信给她好吗？　　说吧
-please, can you give her a message? -Go on.

1148
01:35:22,573 --> 01:35:26,202
你知道，这是我第一次在夜晚睡着了
You know, that's the first time I've ever slept at night.

1149
01:35:27,545 --> 01:35:29,240
我真不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1150
01:35:33,618 --> 01:35:34,607
特里斯顿?
Tristan?

1151
01:35:43,895 --> 01:35:45,658
你看到我朋友了吗？
Have you seen my friend?

1152
01:35:45,763 --> 01:35:47,663
他很奇怪地一大早就离开了
He Ieft absurdly early.

1153
01:35:48,866 --> 01:35:50,094
他走了？
He Ieft?

1154
01:35:50,201 --> 01:35:53,432
他让我告诉你他去见维多利亚了
He told me to tell you he's gone to see Victoria

1155
01:35:53,538 --> 01:35:56,439
因为他很抱歉，但他已经找到了真爱
because he's sorry, but he's found his true Iove

1156
01:35:56,541 --> 01:35:59,669
他想余生和她一起度过
and he wants to spend the rest of his life with her.

1157
01:36:00,745 --> 01:36:01,837
什么？
What?

1158
01:36:02,847 --> 01:36:05,315
你确定吗？　　我肯定
-Are you sure? -I'm positive.

1159
01:36:34,745 --> 01:36:37,612
嘿！嘿，等等！等等！
Hey! Hey, wait! Wait!

1160
01:37:21,225 --> 01:37:22,715
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

1161
01:37:23,694 --> 01:37:24,991
特里斯顿
Tristan.

1162
01:37:26,964 --> 01:37:28,727
发生什么了？
What happened to you?

1163
01:37:30,134 --> 01:37:31,761
我找到了那颗星星
I found the star.

1164
01:37:33,905 --> 01:37:35,805
我不相信你居然做到了
I can't believe you did it.

1165
01:37:35,907 --> 01:37:38,375
我的星星呢？我能看看吗？
Where's my star? Can I see it?

1166
01:37:39,510 --> 01:37:41,535
它漂亮吗？　　是的
-Is it beautiful? -Yes.

1167
01:37:43,781 --> 01:37:45,749
但它却这么小
Well, it's awfully small.

1168
01:37:46,717 --> 01:37:49,743
那只是一小片，作为你生日的纪念品
Well, that's just a little piece. A token for your birthday.

1169
01:37:49,854 --> 01:37:52,652
那么…忘掉星星吧
Well... Well, then forget about the star.

1170
01:37:53,958 --> 01:37:56,153
这不是我要的星星
It's not the star that I want.

1171
01:37:58,596 --> 01:38:00,359
你知道我想要什么
You know what I want.

1172
01:38:02,566 --> 01:38:04,397
是的，我知道
Yeah. I do.

1173
01:38:09,674 --> 01:38:13,610
你想长大，过完这辈子
You want to grow up and get over yourself.

1174
01:38:18,416 --> 01:38:20,043
汉弗莱　　　索朗
-Humphrey. -Thorn.

1175
01:38:20,584 --> 01:38:22,677
你大概是想死了
You must have a death wish.

1176
01:38:30,695 --> 01:38:33,493
汉弗莱，汉弗莱，没事
Humphrey. Humphrey, it's all right.

1177
01:38:34,131 --> 01:38:35,792
她是你的
She's all yours.

1178
01:38:35,900 --> 01:38:38,460
你们是天造地设的一对，衷心祝福你们
You really are a perfect couple. The best of Iuck to you both.

1179
01:38:38,569 --> 01:38:40,399
那么，我要这个干什么？
Well, why would I want this? It's just a measly handful of stardust!

1180
01:38:40,409 --> 01:38:43,599
这只是一把微不足道的星尘！

1181
01:38:48,746 --> 01:38:49,872
亚伊尼？
Yvaine?

1182
01:38:52,016 --> 01:38:53,950
她不能穿过石墙
She can't cross the wall.

1183
01:39:02,693 --> 01:39:03,717
快！
Go on!

1184
01:40:11,228 --> 01:40:14,163
站住！站住！如果你穿过那你会死的！
Stop! Stop! If you go through there, you'll die!

1185
01:40:14,265 --> 01:40:15,323
什么？
What?

1186
01:40:17,501 --> 01:40:20,698
如果你踏上人类的领地，你会变成石头
If you set foot on human soil, you'll turn to rock.

1187
01:40:21,272 --> 01:40:24,764
可悲肮脏的女人！你把我带哪来了？
Wretched slattern! Where have you taken me?

1188
01:40:34,118 --> 01:40:36,609
准备进入石墙了是吗？
PIanning to enter Wall, were you?

1189
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:41,123
如果你愿意死，亲爱的，我很乐意帮你
If death is what you wish, my dear, I'd be more than happy to assist you.

1190
01:40:41,459 --> 01:40:43,359
你在和我说话？
Are you talking to me?

1191
01:40:44,095 --> 01:40:45,722
你，小城民
You. Small world.

1192
01:40:46,730 --> 01:40:50,063
总之，不，我没和你说话，我在和星星说话
Anyhow, no, I wasn't. I was talking to the star.

1193
01:40:50,568 --> 01:40:51,865
什么星星？
What star?

1194
01:40:53,404 --> 01:40:57,101
我的女奴不是星星，傻瓜也看得出来
My slave girl's no star. Any fool can see that.

1195
01:40:57,641 --> 01:41:00,269
如果她是的话，我很久以前…
If she was, I'd have had the heart out of her chest

1196
01:41:00,377 --> 01:41:02,902
就把她的心挖出来了，相信我
a Iong time ago, trust me.

1197
01:41:03,314 --> 01:41:06,715
相信你？我不想再犯错误了
Trust you? Not a mistake I'd be likely to make again.

1198
01:41:07,384 --> 01:41:10,785
想怎么样，临死的莎尔？掷铜板决定？
What's it to be, Ditchwater Sal? Heads or tails?

1199
01:41:40,818 --> 01:41:44,879
哦，天啊，我们该走了　　　她哪也不去
-Oh, God. Time to go. -She's not going anywhere.

1200
01:41:45,022 --> 01:41:46,887
我想你会知道她是谁的
I think you'll find she is.

1201
01:41:46,991 --> 01:41:49,357
没事，你也可以去
It's all right. You can come, too.

1202
01:41:52,263 --> 01:41:56,324
你们可以坐马车或拖在马车后，自己选吧
You can ride in the carriage or be dragged behind it. Your choice.

1203
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,517
刚才发生什么了？
What happened?

1204
01:42:17,621 --> 01:42:19,953
请便客人，我退出
Be my guest. I quit.

1205
01:42:20,057 --> 01:42:23,049
80年了，我防止人们从这出去
Eighty years I've stopped you people going out.

1206
01:42:23,160 --> 01:42:25,025
但是我该更加担心的是
What I should have been worrying about

1207
01:42:25,129 --> 01:42:26,619
有些人会从里面跑出来
was those people from the other side coming in.

1208
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:28,391
好吧，快告诉我发生什么了！
All right, just tell me what happened!

1209
01:42:28,499 --> 01:42:30,364
发生什么？哦，从哪说起呢？
What happened? Oh, where to start?

1210
01:42:31,735 --> 01:42:32,702
不！
No!

1211
01:42:46,717 --> 01:42:47,911
快！
Come on!

1212
01:43:17,815 --> 01:43:18,941
快！
Go on!

1213
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:50,808
星星！
The star!

1214
01:43:51,415 --> 01:43:52,382
这位是谁？
And who else?

1215
01:43:52,483 --> 01:43:55,611
是我们的奴隶，当我们招呼完客人后
A slave for us. It will be nice to have someone to help mop up

1216
01:43:55,719 --> 01:43:57,914
她可以帮我们好好打扫卫生了
when we've finished with our little guest.

1217
01:43:58,022 --> 01:43:59,421
哦，对我们有好处，姐妹
Oh, good work, sister.

1218
01:43:59,523 --> 01:44:02,924
很及时啊，我明白了！你越来越难看了！
And just in time, I see! You Iook awful!

1219
01:45:01,452 --> 01:45:02,851
你是谁？
Who are you?

1220
01:45:04,154 --> 01:45:06,452
你来这儿做什么？
What business do you have here?

1221
01:45:07,891 --> 01:45:09,153
塞普蒂默斯？
Septimus?

1222
01:45:09,693 --> 01:45:11,786
我认识你哥哥，普里默斯
I knew your brother, Primus.

1223
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:15,655
你是不是想去地狱见他？
Unless you wish to meet him in the afterlife,

1224
01:45:15,766 --> 01:45:18,428
我建议你快回答我，你在这干什么？
I suggest you answer my question. What are you doing here?

1225
01:45:18,535 --> 01:45:20,833
我也想问你同样的问题
I might ask you the same thing.

1226
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:39,453
他们有四个人
There are four of them.

1227
01:45:42,426 --> 01:45:45,156
照我说的做我们应该有机会
Do as I say and we may stand a chance.

1228
01:45:45,262 --> 01:45:47,753
等等，我为什么要相信你？
Wait. How do I know you can be trusted?

1229
01:45:47,865 --> 01:45:50,459
你不用，为什么？你还有更好的选择吗？
You don't. Why? Do you have a choice?

1230
01:45:50,567 --> 01:45:52,558
没有　　　那好，我们走
-No. -Well, then, Iet's go.

1231
01:45:59,977 --> 01:46:03,572
走开！走开！
Get off me! Get off!

1232
01:46:07,818 --> 01:46:10,013
乌拉？　　塞普蒂默斯
-Una? -Septimus.

1233
01:46:10,120 --> 01:46:11,587
乌拉！　　姐姐！
-Una! -Sister!

1234
01:46:30,340 --> 01:46:32,205
特里斯顿！别这样！特里斯顿！
Tristan! No! Tristan!

1235
01:46:33,444 --> 01:46:36,140
我是你的…我是你的…母亲
I'm your... I'm your... I'm your mother.

1236
01:46:37,381 --> 01:46:38,939
我是你的母亲
I'm your mother.

1237
01:47:15,652 --> 01:47:18,246
干得好　　　她可以解脱了，是的
-Rather well. -Good riddance to you. Yes.

1238
01:47:43,847 --> 01:47:44,814
哦！
Oh!

1239
01:47:57,861 --> 01:48:00,056
让我们把火灭了
Let's put out those flames.

1240
01:48:00,497 --> 01:48:01,794
好吗？
Shall we?

1241
01:48:52,516 --> 01:48:54,381
那么，现在怎么办？
So, what happens now?

1242
01:48:55,185 --> 01:48:57,585
我们得学会一起生活
We have to Iearn to live with each other.

1243
01:48:57,688 --> 01:48:58,882
永远？
Forever?

1244
01:49:04,394 --> 01:49:06,157
我们继续吧
Let's get on with it.

1245
01:49:10,100 --> 01:49:12,091
象个男人一样，我知道你会的
Be the man that I know you are.

1246
01:49:29,886 --> 01:49:31,183
出去　　　好的
-Get outside. -Okay.

1247
01:49:31,288 --> 01:49:32,277
走
Go.

1248
01:49:42,466 --> 01:49:44,331
特里斯顿！　　抓住他
-Tristan! -Get him.

1249
01:50:20,003 --> 01:50:21,265
走开！
Get off!

1250
01:50:25,409 --> 01:50:27,138
走开！
Get out!

1251
01:51:04,314 --> 01:51:07,174
那么，想变成什么？浪漫的年轻人？
So, what's it to be, Prince Charming? Frog or tadpole?

1252
01:51:07,194 --> 01:51:08,974
青蛙还是蝌蚪？

1253
01:52:06,843 --> 01:52:08,071
塞普蒂默斯？
Septimus?

1254
01:53:30,193 --> 01:53:31,353
特里斯顿！
Tristan!

1255
01:54:15,171 --> 01:54:16,468
年轻
Youth.

1256
01:54:17,407 --> 01:54:18,704
美丽
Beauty.

1257
01:54:20,510 --> 01:54:22,944
对我都不再有意义了
It all seems meaningless now.

1258
01:54:23,647 --> 01:54:25,615
我的姐妹们死了
My sisters are dead!

1259
01:54:27,250 --> 01:54:30,913
我在乎的东西都离开了我，走吧
Everything I cared about gone.

1260
01:54:37,093 --> 01:54:38,185
你们走吧
Go.

1261
01:54:43,667 --> 01:54:44,964
走吧！
Go!

1262
01:55:05,989 --> 01:55:06,956
不！
No!

1263
01:56:04,080 --> 01:56:06,014
我得谢谢你了，孩子
I owe you thanks, boy.

1264
01:56:06,449 --> 01:56:09,543
她的心要是碎了…对我来说就毫无价值
What use was her heart to me when it was broken?

1265
01:56:09,986 --> 01:56:14,889
你除掉了我的姐妹，她的心就全归我一个人了
And you got rid of my sisters and now I can have it all for myself.

1266
01:56:20,764 --> 01:56:23,790
抱紧我，闭上眼睛　　　什么？为什么？
-Hold me tight and close your eyes. -What? Why?

1267
01:56:24,567 --> 01:56:26,194
星星会什么？
What do stars do?

1268
01:56:33,009 --> 01:56:34,169
照耀吧
Shine.

1269
01:57:10,413 --> 01:57:12,074
好啊！　　太棒了！
-Bravo! -Yeah!

1270
01:57:12,482 --> 01:57:13,779
非常好
Very good.

1271
01:57:15,552 --> 01:57:17,076
你为什么不早点这么做？
Why didn't you do that earlier?

1272
01:57:17,187 --> 01:57:19,367
没有你我是做不到的
I couldn't have done that without you. No star can shine with a broken heart.

1273
01:57:19,387 --> 01:57:21,817
心碎的星星是不会发光的

1274
01:57:23,226 --> 01:57:25,091
我以为我会失去你
I thought I'd Iost you.

1275
01:57:26,362 --> 01:57:28,159
但你回来了
But you came back.

1276
01:57:28,565 --> 01:57:30,863
当然回来了，我爱你
Of course I did. I Iove you.

1277
01:57:36,439 --> 01:57:37,667
来吧
Come on.

1278
01:57:57,760 --> 01:57:59,057
特里斯顿
Tristan.

1279
01:58:01,798 --> 01:58:05,790
风暴要塞血统，最后幸存的男性继承人
The Iast surviving male heir of the Stormhold bloodline.

1280
01:58:08,071 --> 01:58:09,698
就是你，特里斯顿
It's you, Tristan.

1281
01:58:13,576 --> 01:58:16,568
但如果他是风暴要塞的新国王，那…
But if he's the new King of Stormhold, then...

1282
01:59:03,660 --> 01:59:08,154
现在我为风暴要塞国王特里斯顿加冕
I crown thee King Tristan of Stormhold.

1283
01:59:25,548 --> 01:59:26,947
好啊！
Yeah!

1284
01:59:42,865 --> 01:59:44,492
我送你的礼物
My gift to you.

1285
01:59:46,302 --> 01:59:47,701
给你们两个的
To you both.

1286
01:59:48,004 --> 01:59:49,335
谢谢
Thank you.

1287
02:00:04,287 --> 02:00:06,847
他们统治了80年
They ruled for 80 years-

1288
02:00:08,091 --> 02:00:11,026
但没人可以永生
But no man can live forever,

1289
02:00:11,928 --> 02:00:15,329
除非他拥有星星的心
except he who possesses the heart of a star-

1290
02:00:16,232 --> 02:00:20,635
亚伊尼把她的那颗心完全献给了特里斯顿
And Yvaine had given hers to Tristan completely-

1291
02:00:22,205 --> 02:00:25,504
当他们的子孙长大的时候
When their children and grandchildren were grown,

1292
02:00:26,542 --> 02:00:29,773
也就是点燃巴比伦蜡烛的时候
it was time to light the Babylon candle-

1293
02:00:35,852 --> 02:00:40,289
在那之后，他们仍然快乐地活着
And they still live happily ever after-
