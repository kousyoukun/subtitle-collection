Yeah, right! You're gonna love it!
 
7
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Kill him! Stomp on the son-of-a...

8
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,600
Don't give them a chance!

9
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:48,480
Hey! Where are you going?

10
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,560
MacLeod!

11
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:01,770
Fasil.

12
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,640
Wait.

13
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,560
All right.

14
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,810
MacLeod!

15
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,060
May this year of our Lord 1536

16
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,390
bring victory to the clan MacLeod!

17
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:58,230
MacLeod! Victory to MacLeod!

- Are you scared, Connor?
- No, cousin Dougal, I'm not!

19
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,810
Don't talk nonsense, man!

20
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:23,640
I peed my kilt the first time I went into battle!

21
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,890
Oh, aye. Angus pees his kilt all the time.

22
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,520
Connor! Connor!

23
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,480
Connow, wait! Wait!

24
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:58,810
Take these flowers and think of me.

25
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,850
Remember, you fight with God
on your side, Connor.

26
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:09,230
A girl like that can wound a soldier
more than a Fraser's sword, my friend.

27
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,890
Wait! Angus, you and Dugal keep him
in one piece, do you hear?

28
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,060
Aye, we all know which piece that is!

29
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,140
- There is one called Connor among them.
- Aye.

30
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:12,270
Remember our agreement, Murdoch.

31
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,940
The boy is mine.

32
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:17,690
It's begun.

33
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,230
Death to the MacLeods!

58
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:23,145
<b>Death to the Macleods!</b>

60

<b>Death to the Frazers!</b>

34
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:57,140
MacLeod!

35
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,190
Come on!

36
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,060
Macleod!

37
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,100
Stay under!

38
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,100
Forgive me,

39
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,190
my son.

40
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,310
Fight me, damn you!

41
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:31,980
No, that's Connor MacLeod!

41
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,950
Fight me, you cowards!

69
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,012
No, not him!

42
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,640
Castrate the heathens!

43
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,890
Nobody will fight me!

44
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,480
They all run away.

45
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,980
Here, laddie, stay by me.

46
00:15:58,810 --> 00:16:00,140
Mother of God!

47
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:06,640
Fight me!

48
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,520
No!

49
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,230
Come on, quick!

50
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:26,520
There can be only one!

51
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:31,640
Another time, MacLeod!

52
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:09,600
- Get out of the car!
- Put your hands on the hood!

53
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,470
- Move!
- Okay!

54
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,900
- Watch it, freak! Just cool it! Watch him!
- Watch him, watch him!

86
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,234
Move! Come on, come on, come on! Move!

87
00:17:24,417 --> 00:17:26,900
Come on, come on!

56
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:31,100
Spread them! Spread them! Come on!

57
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,770
See some ID, pal!

58
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:42,640
Well, Mr. Nash!
Where were you going in such a hurry?

60
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,640
Give me it! Give me it! Give me it!

61
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,270
Don't move, pal.

62
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,940
Don't even breathe.

63
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,890
- It is over.
- No!

64
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,640
Other men are dying this day.
I must attend them.

65
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,270
Quiet!

66
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:04,730
He's a Highlander, by God!

67
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:09,060
The last thing to hear should not be
that of a wailing woman!

68
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:36,020
Hey, come on. Let me through.

69
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,610
Damn it, Frank. Forensics are supposed
to be notified the same time as homicide!

71
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,270
Holy shit!

72
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,730
- Yeah, this one came unassembled.
- Did you made an arrest?

73
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,270
No. We're questioning some guy named Nash.
Antique dealer down on Hudson Street.

74
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,770
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hi, Walt.

75
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,270
You look pretty, Brenda.

76
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,640
What do you think of the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?

77
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,060
Oh, Christ! You're a barrel of laughs, Garfield.

78
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,000
Get your hands off!

78
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,100
Hey, cop! When are you going to explain?
This was my wife's, man!

79
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,400
Hey, Walker, get me a cherry-cheese
Danish toast, please!

80
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,100
What did they say?
What time did he buy it?

80
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,890
Oh! About 10:00, 10:30.

81
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,980
Whatever made the cut was razor sharp.

26
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,100
Get out! I told you, you get out of here
with these cameras!

127
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,200
Frank! Frank!

82
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,060
- Oh, my God!
- About two days ago, the telefax

83
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,200
told that a guy was killed just like this
over in Jersey.

83
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,850
Yeah, but I figured what the hell,
that's Jersey!

83
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,400
<i>Hey, coppers, I want to get out of here!</i>

84
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,940
Hey Frank, come here!

85
00:20:39,770 --> 00:20:41,310
Oh, shit!

86
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,940
Oh, baby, look at you!

87
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,310
Garfield, cover that head.

88
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,770
- What the hell have you got?
- A Toledo Salamanca.

89
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:03,390
- A what?
- A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

90
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,690
- Well, is it worth much?
- Only about a million bucks.

91
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,390
Any antique dealer on Hudson Street
could tell you that.

144
00:21:16,344 --> 00:21:21,299
<i>You can't keep me here, asshole!
I know my rights!</i>

92
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,520
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

93
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,900
The name's Vazilek. Polish national.

93
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,140
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

94
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,860
- You ever get over to New Jersey, Nash?
- Not if I can help it.

95
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:07,940
- You talk funny, Nash. Where're you from?
- Lots of different places.

96
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,060
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hm.

97
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,690
Okay. What's that?

98
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,890
- A sword?
- Wise up, smart ass!

99
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:28,050
That's a Toledo Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million dollars.

99
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,020
So?

100
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,900
- So, you want to hear a theory?
- Mm-hm.

100
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,730
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy.

101
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:37,310
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

102
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay. His name is Iman Fasil.

102
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,350
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

103
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:46,350
Want to hear another theory?

104
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:50,640
This Fasil was so upset
about the lousy wrestling tonight,

105
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,940
he went down to the garage and in a fit
of depression cut off his own head.

106
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:58,060
That's not funny, Walt.

107
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,220
You a faggot, Nash?

107
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,020
Why Garfield?
You're cruising for a piece of ass?

108
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,310
I'll tell you what happened, Russell.

109
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,400
You went down to the garage for a blow job.

109
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,060
You just didn't want to pay for it.

110
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,020
Huh. You are sick.

175
00:23:16,357 --> 00:23:17,689
Hey! Hey!

176
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:19,070
Hey, what are you doing?

177
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,319
Stop! Stop it!

178
00:23:21,402 --> 00:23:24,058
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

179
00:23:24,142 --> 00:23:27,455
That's enough! That's it! Now, cut it out!

180
00:23:27,538 --> 00:23:30,261
Goddamn it, I said cut it out!

114
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:34,100
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

115
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,350
- Then we're through.
- Nash, we're just getting started!

116
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,640
<i>...garage and water from the sprinkler.</i>

117
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,600
<i>It also left a man's decapitated body</i>

118
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:51,100

00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:34,020
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger. Room 315.

121
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:37,940
And I'm going to hit you
for twenty in advance.

122
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:50,600
If there's anything you need, you know,
broads or blow, just dial 0, huh?

123
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:55,940
That's right, Mr. Kruger.  Lucky Strike
means fine tobacco. I'll tell you that.

124
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:59,850
- Don't talk to the guests!
- I didn't do nothin'!

125
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:53,690

I'm Candy.

129
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Of course you are.

130
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,980
Come on in.

131
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,400
- Hiya.
- Hi.

131
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,480
- Got a present for you from the coroner.
- Yeah, what's that?

132
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,810
Pieces of metal. Found them
on the dead guy under the Garden.

133
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,640
In the wound and on the clothes.

134
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,440
Real smooth shave.

135
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,730
That can't be right.

136
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,810
Son of a bitch!

137
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,980
Who's there?

138
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:22,060
- Hey, Brenda. The usual?
- Lots of it.

139
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,310
Say when.

140
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,890
When.

141
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,090
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

142
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,100
A double Glenmorangie on the rocks.

142
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,440
Glenmorangie? Right.

143
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,640
- Go to the Garden often?
- What did you say?

144
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,310
What did you say?

145
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,560
Madison Square Garden.

146
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,520
Do you go there often?

147
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,020
Why?

148
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,100
Basketball,

149
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,270
the circus, wrestling...

150
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,600
Why are you asking me about the Garden?
Have you been following me?

151
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,850
I'd like to walk you home, Brenda.

152
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:34,190

Nice to see you again, Mcleod.

This is the police!</i>

<i>Put down your weapons.
Put your hands on your heads.</i>

00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,850
Another time, Highlander. I will find you!

<i>Hey! Hold it right there! Come back here!</i>

Stop! Wait a minute!

164
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,400
Who in the name of God was that?

164
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,400
He called you Highlander.
What did he mean?

164
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,700
"There can only be one." Only one what?

165
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,800
Listen, lady, you almost--

165
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:29,400
- I want to know--
- Shut up!

166
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,640
Don't you ever follow me again.

167
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,270
You only have one life. If you value it...

168
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:38,440
go home.

169
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,390
You saw the wound, Angus.

170
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:57,390
- He should have died.
- I say he's got the devil in him!

171
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:20,850
Drinking with us, are you?

172
00:33:21,270 --> 00:33:24,890
- What's the matter, Dougal?
- You, talking and breathing.

173
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,020
Last night all but a corpse.

174
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,000
How did you manage that, Connor Mcloed?

174
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,360
Would you rather I was dead?

175
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,890
It's not natural.

176
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:38,440
He's in league with Lucifer.

177
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,190
Don't say that, Kate!

178
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,730
I'll say it! You've the devil in you.

179
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,890
We've been kinsmen 20 years!

180
00:33:49,650 --> 00:33:54,730
Connor MacLeod was my kinsman.
I don't know who you are.

181
00:34:01,230 --> 00:34:03,600
- Angus.
- You'd better go, Connor.

182
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,480
I'm not going anywhere.

183
00:34:08,990 --> 00:34:10,730
He's the devil! Kill him!

184
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,900
- Dougal!
- Leave him be!

299
00:34:36,473 --> 00:34:37,422
Dougal...

185
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,060
Go on, kill him!

186
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:42,560
He's your cousin, man!

187
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,690
No, Angus!

188
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,770
Quiet! Quiet!

189
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,600
There'll be no burning here today.

190
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,810
We'll banish him.

191
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,810
No! Burn him!

192
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:10,560
Burn him!

193
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,850
- Can you walk?
- I'll bloody well walk out of here.

194
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,560
Then go, while you still can!

195
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,730
I'll not forget you, Angus.

196
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,230
That's a good dog.

197
00:37:40,690 --> 00:37:42,520
- Pie and ale, do you want it?
- Aye.

198
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,310
Right now!

199
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,850
You filthy sod! You're all muck and muscle.

200
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:52,730
Aye, blossom. The way you like it.

201
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,060
You can do that to me forever,
if you like, my Lord.

202
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,560
- Will you, Connor?
- Aye, blossom. I will.

203
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:32,350
Hello!

204
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,770
Greetings.

205
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,390
I am Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez,

206
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:47,690
chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain,

207
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
and I'm at your service.

208
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,020
Who?

209
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,730
- What do you want?
- You.

210
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,900
You're Connor MacLeod.

210
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,770
- Maybe I am--
- You're Connor MacLeod,

211
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:08,900
wounded in battle

211
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,250
and driven from your village of Glenfinnan

212
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,060
five years ago.

213
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,730
Connor!

214
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,900
Heather, go in the house.

214
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:20,070
I'll stay right here.

215
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,140
Do as I say, woman!

216
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:38,310
The sensation you're feeling

217
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:41,190
is the Quickening.

218
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,060
- Who are you?
- We are the same, MacLeod.

219
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:50,560
We are brothers!

220
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,270
I knew you guys were bottle-fed.

221
00:40:02,310 --> 00:40:05,520
Yeah, well, there's not a hell of a lot
I can do about it, pal.

222
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,640
You see what I'm up against!

223
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,020
His Vietnamese neighbor ate his dog.

224
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,200
That's confidential.

224
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,520
- How are things over at forensics?
- Dull.

225
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:21,800
- How about some lunch?
- Lunch? It's a good idea. Who pays?

226
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,890
- Me.
- You're on.

227
00:40:24,310 --> 00:40:25,900
- Oh, by the way, Frank.
- Yeah.

227
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,700
- The hairs in the Moretti case?
- Uh-huh.

227
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:29,900
- They matched up.
- What did I tell you?

228
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,890
Oh! I forgot my purse.

229
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,980
I'll meet you outside.

230
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:37,730
Garfield, Brenda and I are going to lunch.

231
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:26,730
<i>Sometimes, MacLeod,
the sharpest blade is not enough.</i>

232
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:37,060
# B-A-L-A-N-C-E #

233
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,900
# Balance #

233
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:42,980
I don't like boats. I don't like water.
I'm a man not a fish.

234
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,140
As you complain endlessly.

235
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,000
You look like a woman, you stupid haggis!

235
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,430
Haggis? What is haggis?

236
00:41:51,650 --> 00:41:53,850
A sheep's stomach
stuffed with meat and barley.

237
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,270
- And what do you do with it?
- You eat it!

238
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:00,480
How revolting!

239
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,030
Be still for God's sake! You'll tip us over!

239
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,100
So?

240
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:08,230
I cannot swim, you Spanish peacock!

240
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,100
I'm not Spanish, I'm Egyptian.

241
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:11,700
You said you were from Spain.

241
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:12,850
You are a liar!

242
00:42:14,310 --> 00:42:18,440
You have the manners of a goat,
and you smell like a dungheap,

243
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:23,190
and you've no knowledge whatsoever
of your potential. Now!

244
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,060
- Get out!
- No!

245
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,500
Help! Help! Help!

245
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,900
Help!

246
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:38,390
- Help me, I'm drowning!
- You can't drown, you fool!

247
00:42:38,810 --> 00:42:40,440
You're Immortal.

248
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,350
I'm drowning!

249
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,980
# We ask you Thy, #

250
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,020
# Heavenly Father... #

251
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,980
I'm alive!

252
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,560
I can breathe!

389
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,900
I'm going to slice you in half.

253
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,060
Crude and slow, clansman. Your attack
was no better than that of a clumsy child.

254
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,020
This cannot be.

255
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:08,350
It's the devil's work.

256
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:15,480
You cannot die, MacLeod. Accept it.

257
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,520
- I hate you.
- Good.

258
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:25,140
That is a perfect way to start.

259
00:44:27,190 --> 00:44:30,230
Tell me, how did it happen for God's sake?

260
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,190
Why does the sun come up? Hmm?

261
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:42,270
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night? Who knows?

262
00:44:43,310 --> 00:44:47,230
What I do know is that
because you were born different,

263
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,020
men will fear you, try to drive you away,

264
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,310
like the people of your village.

265
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,730
You must learn to conceal your special gift

266
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:10,270
and harness your power

267
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:13,270
until the time of the Gathering.

268
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,770
What Gathering?

269
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:20,140
When only a few of us are left,

270
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,640
we will feel an irresistible pull
towards a faraway land

271
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,600
to fight for the prize.

272
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,560
Come on!

273
00:45:33,850 --> 00:45:35,060
Faster!

274
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,690
Never lose your temper.

275
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,690
If your head comes away from your neck,
it's over.

276
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,600
Never overextend your thrust.

277
00:46:20,230 --> 00:46:24,020
You're vulnerable and off balance.

278
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,100
Connor!

279
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:29,640
Heather, please!

280
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,980
If it came down to just us two,
would you take my head?

281
00:46:52,770 --> 00:46:56,020
We must fight until only one remains.

282
00:46:56,440 --> 00:47:00,850
You're safe only on holy ground.
None of us will violate that law.

283
00:47:01,270 --> 00:47:02,980
It's tradition.

284
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:18,190
Now for the last.

285
00:47:19,230 --> 00:47:20,770
Trust me.

286
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,440
Let yourself feel the stag.

287
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:33,020
His heart... beating,

288
00:47:40,350 --> 00:47:41,890
his blood...

289
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:43,350
coursing.

290
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:45,390
Feel?

291
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:49,020
- Come on!
- I feel him.

292
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,900
MacLeod, come on!

293
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,020
- I feel him!
- Come on!

294
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,310
I feel him!

295
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,850
Come on, Haggis!

296
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:16,730
MacLeod, this is the Quickening!

00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,000
- Yeah!
- Yes!

297
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:58,520
Now, Pendejo, shall we see
what sort of swordsman you've become?

298
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,350
En garde!

299
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:09,850
Very good.

300
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,980
Give me your hand, brother.

301
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:50,890
That one there. How much is it?

302
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:09,980
Put him in.

303
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,230
But what I want is a family.

304
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:16,440
You cannot have a family.
We cannot have children.

305
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:22,140
That won't please Heather.
I'll tell you that for nothing.

306
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:26,310
He's full of life.

307
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:29,390
Connor!

308
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,310
Here's dinner.

309
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:39,520
I'll be off now.
I fancy buying myself a new dress.

310
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:46,190
Oh, you little devils. Go on!

311
00:50:48,690 --> 00:50:50,440
She is beautiful.

312
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,520
You must leave her, brother.

313
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:07,270
MacLeod,

314
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,600
I was born 2,437 years ago.

315
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:14,980
In that time I've had 3 wives.

316
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,310
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

317
00:51:18,730 --> 00:51:23,350
Her father, Masamune, a genius,
made this for me.

318
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,730
in 593 B.C.

319
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,190
It is the only one of its kind,

320
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:33,890
like his daughter.

321
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,980
When Shakiko died, I was shattered.

322
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,560
I would save you that pain.

323
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:43,690
Please, let Heather go.

324
00:52:02,310 --> 00:52:07,100
When we first met, you felt ill, remember?

325
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,740
That wasn't the first time
you felt that sensation, was it?

325
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,800
No.

326
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,980
When the MacLeods fought the Frasers,
and a black knight...

327
00:52:18,690 --> 00:52:19,950
I felt it then.

327
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:22,310
Only it was different, more painful.

328
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:27,890
That black knight was the Kurgan.
It's because of him that I sought you out.

329
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:33,190
Who is the Kurgan?
And where does he come from?

330
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,020
The Kurgans were an ancient people
from the steppes of Russia.

331
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,810
For amusement they tossed children
into pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat.

332
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:47,350
The Kurgan. He is the strongest
of all the Immortals.

333
00:52:47,770 --> 00:52:50,480
He is the perfect warrior.

334
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:56,020
If he wins the prize, mortal man
would suffer an eternity of darkness.

335
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,600
How do you fight such a savage?

336
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,560
With heart, faith and steel.

337
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:07,890
In the end, there can be only one.

338
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,200
It must have been very dangerous for you.

338
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,060
Well, I was very much in love with her,
my dear Heather.

339
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,690
She was the only thing on my mind,
not danger.

340
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:25,980
So, holding the rose in my teeth,
I climbed up on the rooftop,

341
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,600
lowered a rope and swung in
through the open window.

342
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:37,640
- Unfortunately, the lady was no longer there.
- What did you do?

343
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,270
I introduced myself to the lady thatwas there.

344
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,940
She was most helpful.

345
00:53:46,150 --> 00:53:48,190
Would you like some more wine?

346
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:50,020
Yes, please.

347
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,480
- Heather, get out.
- What's wrong?

348
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,310
Get out!

349
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,270
Kurgan!

350
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,480
Ramírez!

351
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:33,480
The Highlander, where is he?

353
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:38,440
- You're too late. I've prepared him for you.
- You waste your time!

354
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,480
It hurts?

355
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,270
Now you die!

356
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:30,600
You cannot win, Ramírez. I'm the strongest!

357
00:55:30,980 --> 00:55:32,940
My cut has improved your voice.

358
00:57:15,150 --> 00:57:16,350
Yes!

359
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:50,520
Hurts?

360
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,480
Who is the woman?

361
00:57:59,150 --> 00:58:00,690
She's mine.

362
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:03,980
Not for much longer.

363
00:58:13,850 --> 00:58:16,440
Tonight you sleep in hell.

364
00:58:17,230 --> 00:58:19,190
There can be only one!

365
00:59:06,440 --> 00:59:08,600
Hello, pretty!

366
00:59:19,650 --> 00:59:21,200
I'd like to speak to Russell Nash.

366
00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:24,060
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Nash isn't here
at the moment.

367
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,600
May I call him at home?
I have to talk to him today.

367
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:29,100
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

368
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:34,190
- Good morning.
- This is Brenda Wyatt, Mr. Nash.

369
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:39,270
We've already met, Rachel.
What can I do for you?

370
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,190
I'd like some advice.

371
00:59:41,690 --> 00:59:44,200
Are you the kind of woman
who takes advice?

371
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:47,310
- That depends.
- Advice about what?

372
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:51,100
What can you tell me about a 7'' lunatic
hacking away with a broadsword

373
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:54,190
at 1 o'clock in the morning
in Ney York city, 1985?

374
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,100
Not much.

375
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:01,300
What about a Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C.?

375
375
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,100
The metal in the blade folded 200 times.

376
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:06,770
I don't deal in exotic weapons.

377
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,480
Can I show you something
in 18th century silver?

378
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:14,230
That's not why I came here, and you know it.

379
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:18,100
- Do you cook?
- Why?

379
01:00:18,600 --> 01:00:20,770
I thought we might have dinner.

380
01:00:21,310 --> 01:00:22,820
- Did you?
- Yes.

381
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:31,480
So, I'm standing there, and there's Brenda!
Our little Brenda.

382
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,770
You're sure it was Brenda?

383
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,730
She was in Nash's shop.
She was talking to him.

384
01:00:46,270 --> 01:00:50,890
- What are you looking at, Rachel?
- The eyes in the back of your head.

385
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:57,480
People are asking about you.
What am I supposed to say?

386
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:02,350
Tell them I'm Immortal.

387
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:05,560
[in German] Attention! Four men over here!

388
01:01:38,150 --> 01:01:39,940
Quiet.

389
01:01:45,770 --> 01:01:47,140
Don't be afraid.

390
01:01:47,690 --> 01:01:49,770
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

391
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:53,480
- What happened?
- Everybody is dead.

392
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,100
I'm like you. I'm alone.

393
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:01,480
Come with me, Rachel.

394
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:21,690
- You're alive! Why didn't you die?
- Hey, it's a kind of magic.

395
01:02:26,020 --> 01:02:28,100
- [in German] You should be dead!
- Move!

396
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:31,270
[in German] No! You'll have to shoot me first.

397
01:02:32,150 --> 01:02:35,650
Whatever you say, Jack.
You're the master race.

398
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,440
Let's go.

399
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,270
That was a long time ago.

400
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:49,020
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

401
01:02:50,230 --> 01:02:54,100
You can't hide your feelings from me.
I've known you too long.

402
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,810
- What feelings?
- How about loneliness?

403
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,480
I'm not lonely.

404
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:05,060
- I've got everything I need right here.
- Oh no, you don't.

405
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,980
You refuse to let anyone love you.

406
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:12,640
Love is for poets.

407
01:03:17,270 --> 01:03:19,890
You're such a romantic, Rachel.

408
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,940
You always were.

409
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:47,020
Just a minute!

410
01:04:06,230 --> 01:04:07,390
Good evening.

411
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:15,940
Do you want to dine in the hall,
or shall we step inside?

412
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,190
Come in.

413
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:23,100
May I take your coat?

413
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:24,430
- No thanks.
- What?

414
01:04:24,650 --> 01:04:27,520
- I'll hold on to it.
- Oh, fine.

415
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,600
- Where are you going?
- I forgot my earrings.

416
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:38,560
Make yourself a drink.
There are glasses in the bar.

417
01:04:50,980 --> 01:04:52,690
Do you know what you're doing?

418
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,140
I like your place, Brenda.

419
01:05:16,560 --> 01:05:20,390
I've only been here 3 months.
I'm still cleaning it up.

420
01:05:24,850 --> 01:05:28,020
- Interesting view.
- What did you say?

421
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:36,140
I said, "interesting view".

422
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:37,890
Isn't it great?

423
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:48,440
You never told me what you do for a living.

424
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:52,980
I work for the Metropolitan Museum.

425
01:05:54,810 --> 01:05:56,270
In Aquisitions.

426
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,890
That explains your interest
in ancient weapons.

427
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:04,980
Right.

428
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:09,020
Especially the Samurai.

429
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:11,640
Very nice.

430
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:15,520
- Shall we have a toast?
- Yes.

431
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:22,060
Brandy.

432
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,480
Bottled in 1783.

433
01:06:25,900 --> 01:06:27,600
Wow! That's old.

434
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,060
1783 was a very good year.

435
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,980
Mozart wrote his Great Mass.

436
01:06:39,690 --> 01:06:44,020
The Montgolfier Brothers went up
in their first balloon.

438
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:52,100
And England recognized
the independence of the United States.

439
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:53,890
Is that right?

440
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:55,850
Yes.

441
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,140
What's that?

442
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:09,000
- It's for you.
- Can I open it?

442
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:10,350
If you like.

443
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,350
You bastard! Where did you find this?

444
01:07:27,770 --> 01:07:30,390
I have an extensive library.

445
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:35,310
Odd thing, your bio doesn't mention the Met.

446
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:39,600
It says you work for the police. In forensics.

447
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:43,810
- Are you and Moran trying to set me up?
- I don't work for Moran.

448
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:48,730
Then why is that bald policeman sitting
outside watching your apartment?

449
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:52,640
You remember him.
Moran's had him tailing me.

450
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,690
What're you gonna do?

451
01:07:55,650 --> 01:07:57,700
The question is what are you gonna do?

451
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,770
You're going to turn off the tape
or you're going to shoot me with the .45?

452
01:08:04,850 --> 01:08:08,800
I am not looking for a killer. I am looking
for a sword, the one used on Fasil.

453
01:08:08,900 --> 01:08:10,600
I found pieces of it under the Garden.

453
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,440
- I only want to see the Samurai.
- Why?

454
01:08:12,850 --> 01:08:15,200
I told you! Because it's not supposed to exist!

455
01:08:15,650 --> 01:08:19,900
I dated pieces of the blade at 600 B.C.
The metal had been folded 200 times.

455
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:22,140
The Japanese didn't start making
swords like that till the Middle Ages.

456
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,850
So where the hell did it come from?

457
01:08:25,270 --> 01:08:28,300
If I could verify the existence
of such a weapon, it would be like...

458
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:32,770
discovering 747 a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

459
01:08:33,850 --> 01:08:35,190
This is crazy.

460
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:39,060
Wait a minute, Nash, I want some answers.

461
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,690
You want?

462
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:45,690
Don't you ever think about anything
except what you want?

463
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:03,020

My husband.

468
01:11:14,150 --> 01:11:16,270
I am that, my love.

469
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:22,770
I've never really known...

470
01:11:23,940 --> 01:11:25,060
What?

471
01:11:26,730 --> 01:11:28,770
Why you stayed.

472
01:11:31,020 --> 01:11:34,640
Because I love you as much now
as the first day we met.

473
01:11:37,690 --> 01:11:39,440
And I love you.

474
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:45,890
I don't want to die.

475
01:11:47,060 --> 01:11:48,980
I want to stay with you.

476
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,810
Forever.

477
01:11:51,230 --> 01:11:52,890
I want that, too.

478
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,980
Will you do something for me, Connor?

479
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:01,140
What, blossom?

480
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:07,810
In the years to come, will you light a candle
and remember me on my birthday?

481
01:12:09,150 --> 01:12:10,600
Aye, love.

482
01:12:11,020 --> 01:12:12,520
I will.

483
01:12:13,440 --> 01:12:15,890
I wanted to have your children.

484
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,390
They would have been strong and fine.

485
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,480
Don't see me, Connor.

486
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:30,140
Let me die in peace.

487
01:12:32,770 --> 01:12:34,230
Where are we?

488
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,600
We're in the Highlands.

489
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:47,730
Where else?

490
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:53,940
Running down a mountain side.

491
01:13:07,940 --> 01:13:09,640
The sun is shining.

492
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,020
It's not cold.

493
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,600
You've got your sheepskins on.

494
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,560
And the boots I made for you.

495
01:13:27,650 --> 01:13:29,890
Goodnight, my bonny Heather.

496
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:47,190
Hey, Kastagir!

497
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:52,940
MacLeod. It's good to see you again.

498
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:55,520
It seems like a hundred years.

499
01:13:55,940 --> 01:13:57,600
It's been a hundred years.

500
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:07,560
How've you been?

501
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:09,900
Hey!

501
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:11,300
This...

502
01:14:12,810 --> 01:14:14,980
...puts hairs on your chest.

503
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:20,480
- What is it?
- Boom-boom!

504
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:24,850
A big strong man like you shouldn't
be afraid of a little boom-boom!

505
01:14:25,230 --> 01:14:29,730
- Or maybe you think I'm trying to poison you?
- I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

506
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,690
So, the Gathering is here.

507
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:42,520
- Time has almost caught us, my friend.
- Has it? You think we should go on?

508
01:14:44,980 --> 01:14:46,940
I think we should have a party.

509
01:14:47,350 --> 01:14:50,300
Oh no! I remember the last time
we had a party.

509
01:14:50,450 --> 01:14:52,600
Really, when exactly was that?

510
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,730
It was 1783.

511
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:57,470
1783...

512
01:14:58,060 --> 01:15:01,850
Oh yes! Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

513
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:04,190
You were drunk.

513
01:15:04,260 --> 01:15:07,260
- What was that guy's name again?
- His name was Bassett.

514
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:09,850
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett!
I implore you!

514
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:11,850
I am fighting the duel, Hotchkiss, not you!

515
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,640
See if the imbecile is ready.

516
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,140
- Mr. Bassett is waiting, Sir.
- Tell him I'm ready.

517
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,600
Christ, I've gone blind!

518
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:25,060
En garde, Sir!

519
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:32,850
- Wonderful, Sir.
- Thank you, Hotchkiss.

520
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:36,890
Bassett, is that you?

521
01:15:37,350 --> 01:15:39,100
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

522
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:01,350
Stop, Sir!

523
01:16:01,770 --> 01:16:03,270
I beseech...

524
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:07,910
I apologize for calling your wife
a bloated warthog.

526
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:11,730
And I bid you a good day.

527
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,000
- Shoot him, Sir?
- What?

527
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,140
Shoot him. Now, Sir. Now, Sir.
In the back of the head. Now, Sir!

528
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,560
Hotchkiss! Hotchkiss, stop it!

529
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:25,690
- Hotchkiss...
- Sir?

530
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:27,640
No, Sir.

531
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:38,100
<i>That's the mood of New York at this moment.</i>

532
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:41,940
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- <i>An angry city in the grip of fear.</i>

788
01:16:48,816 --> 01:16:51,330
<i>Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure,</i>

789
01:16:51,371 --> 01:16:53,827
<i>the mayor's office issued
the following statement.</i>

533
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,940
- Give us a drink, pal.
- Got a joint?

792
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,122
<i>Police departments are continuing
the vigorous investigation</i>

793
01:16:59,205 --> 01:17:02,060
<i>following up on a number
of promising leads.</i>

534
01:17:02,100 --> 01:17:03,190
Hey, Rockefeller.

535
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:07,940
How'd you like Candy?
She said you were kind of kinky, huh?

536
01:17:09,900 --> 01:17:12,100
Don't ever speak to me.

537
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:19,480
Look, I didn't mean...

538
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:26,100
Don't ever speak to me again!

539
01:17:26,520 --> 01:17:28,270
Do you understand?

540
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:31,980
Good.

541
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:40,270
I hope you get your head chopped off, asshole!

542
01:17:42,310 --> 01:17:45,190
And you! Shut it!

813
01:18:07,533 --> 01:18:10,072
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

543
01:18:18,690 --> 01:18:19,640
What the hell?

544
01:18:33,770 --> 01:18:36,230
Okay, Marine, this is for real.

545
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,200
Let's go!

546
01:18:46,980 --> 01:18:49,100
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, come on!

547
01:19:01,690 --> 01:19:03,730
What the hell's going on?!

548
01:20:58,100 --> 01:20:59,140
For God's sake.

549
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,190
Look at that!

550
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,890
Mother of God...

551
01:21:57,350 --> 01:21:58,600
Mom!

552
01:22:03,770 --> 01:22:06,140
Hey, where're you going with my car?

553
01:22:06,560 --> 01:22:09,850
Daddy, help me! Daddy! Daddy, help me!

554
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,900
Frank! Will you take it easy?

554
01:22:20,950 --> 01:22:24,440
I'm telling you, I checked everywhere with
everybody. There just aren't any witnesses!

555
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,820
That's New York for you!

556
01:22:26,940 --> 01:22:29,390
Twenty people standing around,
nobody saw a goddamn thing.

557
01:22:29,810 --> 01:22:32,600
Tell me about this Matunas.
What is he, on drugs?

557
01:22:32,650 --> 01:22:33,270
He's a survival man.

558
01:22:33,310 --> 01:22:36,300
- What do you mean "survival man"?
- He's into guns. He was a Marine in Vietnam.

559
01:22:36,350 --> 01:22:40,890
I talked to his ex-CO. He said that the guy
was a little paranoid, but he was good a man.

560
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,900
- How're you doing, kid?
- Okay, I guess.

560
01:22:45,950 --> 01:22:49,560
For a guy who had 3 feet of steel crammed
through his gut. How're you doing old man?

561
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:53,100
I understand you saw the guy
that stuck you, is that right?

562
01:22:53,520 --> 01:22:55,020
You're kidding me, man.

563
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,980
Is that him?

564
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:58,230
Nope.

565
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:02,000
Come on, quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley!

565
01:23:02,050 --> 01:23:03,640
The freak was trying to kill me!

566
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:09,190
I'll never forget his face. He had a scar
across his neck. That ain't him.

567
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:10,730
Shit!

568
01:23:13,690 --> 01:23:15,730
- Depressed?
- Yeah.

569
01:23:17,150 --> 01:23:19,560
You don't know grunt about depressed.

570
01:23:19,980 --> 01:23:24,280
I got me a .357,
I got me a trunk load of shotguns,

571
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:27,560
I got three big-bore rifles,
and ammo up the ass.

572
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:31,100
And I ain't safe. I can't protect myself!

573
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:33,440
Okay, Take it easy, pal. Take it easy!

574
01:23:33,650 --> 01:23:36,440
That weirdo, man. He got up,

575
01:23:36,850 --> 01:23:41,020
after I'd put enough lead in him to drop a rhino.

576
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:44,680
Hey, listen, listen. You think you could
work with one of our artists,

577
01:23:44,730 --> 01:23:47,000
maybe come up with a picture of this guy?

577
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:49,440
Sure. Sure. Yes.

578
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:52,060
Take it easy, pal.

579
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:55,060
- Hey, cop!
- Yeah?

580
01:23:55,480 --> 01:23:57,520
I know you guys think I'm nuts,

581
01:23:58,940 --> 01:24:00,560
but there's something else I gotta tell you.

582
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:04,020
After he threw me against the wall...

583
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:25,600
- This is getting like "One Step Beyond".
- Yeah.

583
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:27,970
Listen, when we get out there, remember.
All we've got is an eye-witness.

584
01:24:28,020 --> 01:24:30,400
Now, don't say anything about
swordfights in New York city,

584
01:24:30,450 --> 01:24:32,300
or guys glowing in the dark for Christ's sake.

585
01:24:33,900 --> 01:24:35,900
Hey, Moran!

585
01:24:36,270 --> 01:24:38,270
Have you read what it says in here?

586
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:41,770
Are you kidding, Tony?
You know cops can't read.

587
01:24:42,190 --> 01:24:44,640
What does "incompetent" mean?

588
01:24:46,100 --> 01:24:50,100
That mayor, he calls me
at 2 o'clock in the morning!

589
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,770
I mean, I don't even answer
the phone anymore.

590
01:24:53,190 --> 01:24:55,940
What does "baffled" mean?

591
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:30,560
Karen Joan Nash.

592
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,440
Yeah, I remember this one.

593
01:25:34,850 --> 01:25:38,500
I was practicing in Syracuse.
Didn't get many of these.

593
01:25:38,650 --> 01:25:39,690
What?

594
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:44,140
Unwed mothers.
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

595
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,390
Back then in Syracuse,
that was a stoning offense.

596
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:51,810
What happened?

597
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:56,520
- She had the baby and she died.
- So, Nash was illegitimate?

598
01:25:56,940 --> 01:26:00,100
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was illegitimate.

599
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:04,060
For about a minute and a half.
He died right after she did.

600
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:09,850
He died?

601
01:26:20,900 --> 01:26:22,310
Hello, Brenda.

602
01:26:22,940 --> 01:26:24,240
I did what you asked.

602
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:27,510
I spent all night going through the old deeds
to Nash's house in Hudson Street,

603
01:26:27,560 --> 01:26:32,640
all the way back back through the five previous
owners to the original guy, Montague in 1796.

604
01:26:33,060 --> 01:26:36,230
In all five instances,
Montague through Nash,

605
01:26:36,650 --> 01:26:40,270
I found a death certificate for a kid
with the same name who died at birth,

606
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:44,350
years before he pretended
to sign for his inheritance.

607
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:47,270
Jesus, Rick. Isn't there any heat in here?

608
01:26:47,690 --> 01:26:49,690
No, heat is bad for the circuits.

609
01:26:50,100 --> 01:26:52,980
Now, just in case there's any doubt...

610
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:16,750
So what you've got here, Brenda,

610
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:19,890
is a guy who's been creeping around
since at least 1700,

611
01:27:20,310 --> 01:27:22,480
pretending to croak every once in a while,

612
01:27:22,900 --> 01:27:26,690
leaving all these goods to kids
who've been corpses for years

613
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:29,230
and assuming their identities.

614
01:27:34,810 --> 01:27:36,810
It's not possible.

615
01:27:39,060 --> 01:27:42,940
"Post" final!
Cops release Headhunter picture!

616
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:44,900
- Reward offered!
- I'll take a "Post".

616
01:27:44,950 --> 01:27:46,770
- Me too.
- Headhunter revealed!

617
01:28:20,520 --> 01:28:22,770
For you, my bonny Heather.

618
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:25,890
Happy birthday.

619
01:28:27,940 --> 01:28:30,060
And you, Juan Ramírez.

620
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:34,640
Take care of her, you overdressed haggis.

621
01:29:11,940 --> 01:29:14,140
Kastagir is gone.

622
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:16,890
Only you and I remain.

623
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:27,430
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

624
01:29:27,940 --> 01:29:29,480
Who cuts your hair?

625
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,600
I am in disguise.

626
01:29:34,020 --> 01:29:36,690
This way no one will recognize me.

627
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,440
I do.

628
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:44,980
- What do you want?
- Your head.

629
01:29:46,690 --> 01:29:48,310
And the prize.

630
01:29:50,600 --> 01:29:51,940
Watch.

631
01:29:52,650 --> 01:29:54,940
Happy Halloween, ladies!

632
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:07,310
Nuns! No sense of humor.

633
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:12,810
Ramírez's blade did not cut deeply enough.

634
01:30:13,230 --> 01:30:15,400
He was right about you. You're slime.

635
01:30:15,520 --> 01:30:18,020
Ramírez was an effete snob!

636
01:30:18,440 --> 01:30:20,560
He died on his knees.

637
01:30:20,980 --> 01:30:26,520
I took his head and raped his woman
before his blood was even cold.

639
01:30:35,520 --> 01:30:37,730
I see!

640
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,440
Ramírez lied.

641
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:45,520
She was not his woman.

642
01:30:46,560 --> 01:30:48,390
She was your woman.

643
01:30:49,100 --> 01:30:51,440
And she never told you.

644
01:30:52,560 --> 01:30:54,850
I wonder why.

645
01:30:55,270 --> 01:30:59,690
Perhaps I gave her something
you never could...

646
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:06,140
and secretly she yearned for my return.

647
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:08,560
Holy ground, Highlander!

648
01:31:08,980 --> 01:31:12,020
Remember what Ramírez taught you.

649
01:31:16,730 --> 01:31:19,310
You can't stay in here forever.

650
01:31:22,230 --> 01:31:24,230
You are weak, Highlander.

651
01:31:24,730 --> 01:31:30,140
You will always be weaker than I.

652
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:35,980
I'll be out front.

653
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,100
Goodbye, MacLeod.

654
01:31:42,520 --> 01:31:45,060
We will meet soon enough.

655
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,350
This is the house of God.

656
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:02,480
People are trying to pray.
You're disturbing them.

657
01:32:04,150 --> 01:32:07,690
He cares about these helpless mortals?

658
01:32:08,900 --> 01:32:10,810
Of course he cares.

659
01:32:11,230 --> 01:32:13,230
He died for our sins.

660
01:32:13,650 --> 01:32:15,600
That shall be his undoing.

661
01:32:17,850 --> 01:32:18,850
Father,

662
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:21,770
forgive me.

663
01:32:22,190 --> 01:32:24,690
I am a worm.

664
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,480
I have something to say.

665
01:32:40,900 --> 01:32:44,310
It's better to burn out than to fade away.

666
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:55,400
I need to see him, goddamn it!

667
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:58,480
I'm afraid that's impossible. Mr. Nash is--

668
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,020
Mr. Nash is dead, Miss Ellenstein!

669
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:08,140
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a dead guy named Nash.

670
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:10,600
He died at birth in Syracuse, New York.

671
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:18,060
All right.

672
01:33:19,230 --> 01:33:20,600
Come on.

673
01:33:47,020 --> 01:33:49,140
Are the claymores real?

674
01:33:50,730 --> 01:33:54,980
What is this, a museum?
This stuff must be worth a fortune.

675
01:34:03,850 --> 01:34:07,020
I have been alive for four and a half centuries.

676
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:08,940
I cannot die.

677
01:34:11,690 --> 01:34:14,100
Well, everybody's got their problems.

678
01:34:20,810 --> 01:34:22,270
What are you goning to do with that?

679
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,230
Take it.

680
01:34:39,020 --> 01:34:41,940
I am Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod.

681
01:34:42,690 --> 01:34:47,480
I was born in 1518 in the village of
Glennfinnan on the shores of Loch Shiel.

682
01:34:49,730 --> 01:34:51,440
And I am immortal.

683
01:36:30,500 --> 01:36:31,900
You're not listening.

683
01:36:32,400 --> 01:36:36,060
Brenda, it isn't going to work.
I can't get involved, not again.

684
01:36:49,400 --> 01:36:51,640
You know what's weird?

685
01:36:52,060 --> 01:36:54,310
Most people are afraid to die.

686
01:36:54,730 --> 01:36:56,890
That's not your problem.

687
01:36:57,310 --> 01:36:59,600
You're afraid to live.

688
01:37:04,270 --> 01:37:06,190
Take care of yourself.

689
01:37:06,600 --> 01:37:08,520
Don't lose your head.

690
01:37:24,190 --> 01:37:26,060
Hello, pretty.

691
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:31,890

<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

701
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,640
The endless killing's driven him mad.

702
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:02,900
Rachel, there are some instructions
in the desk drawer.

702
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:04,440
I want you to follow them.

703
01:41:04,850 --> 01:41:09,230
There is a power of attorney for you.
You'll have everything you need.

704
01:41:10,270 --> 01:41:12,020
You're not coming back!

705
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:17,520
Even if you kill him,
you're not coming back, are you?

706
01:41:27,060 --> 01:41:32,060
Sweet Rachel, you always knew
this would happen.

707
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:35,310
Russell Nash dies tonight.

708
01:41:50,650 --> 01:41:53,520
Hey, it's a kind of magic.

709
01:42:02,940 --> 01:42:04,600
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

710
01:47:22,350 --> 01:47:24,310
So now it ends.

711
01:47:42,900 --> 01:47:44,480
What kept you?

712
01:50:00,350 --> 01:50:02,310
There can be only one.

713
01:50:35,060 --> 01:50:38,060
The Quickening overcomes me!

714
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:41,140
I know everything!

715
01:50:41,940 --> 01:50:45,060
I know! I know everything!

1071
01:50:45,180 --> 01:50:47,400
I am everything!

716
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,270
So, this is where it all began.

717
01:51:50,600 --> 01:51:52,980
Can you tell me about the prize?

718
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,600
It's like a whirlwind in my head.

719
01:51:56,020 --> 01:52:00,940
But if I concentrate, I know what people
are thinking all over the world.

720
01:52:01,350 --> 01:52:05,230
Presidents, diplomats, scientists.

722
01:52:05,650 --> 01:52:08,520
I can help them understand each other.

723
01:52:09,440 --> 01:52:11,270
What am I thinking?

724
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:15,390
You're thinking whether or not
you can love me. You can!

725
01:52:15,810 --> 01:52:21,060
I'm just like you. I can love and
have children. Live and grow old.

726
01:52:21,480 --> 01:52:25,020
You never prepared me for that,
