Yeah!

23
00:03:56,585 --> 00:04:00,335
Yeah, right! You're gonna love it!

24
00:04:22,335 --> 00:04:24,335
Kill him! Stomp on the son-of-a...

25
00:04:41,425 --> 00:04:44,835
Don't give them a chance!

26
00:04:46,385 --> 00:04:48,715
Hey! Where are you going?

27
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:55,795
MacLeod!

28
00:06:01,005 --> 00:06:02,005
Fasil.

29
00:06:03,005 --> 00:06:03,875
Wait.

30
00:06:24,465 --> 00:06:25,795
All right.

31
00:11:31,425 --> 00:11:33,045
MacLeod!

32
00:11:47,885 --> 00:11:51,295
May this year of our Lord 1536

33
00:11:51,715 --> 00:11:54,625
bring victory to the clan MacLeod!

34
00:11:55,045 --> 00:11:58,465
MacLeod! Victory to MacLeod!

35
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:17,795
- Are you scared, Connor?
- No, cousin Dougal, I'm not!

36
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:20,045
Don't talk nonsense, man!

37
00:12:20,465 --> 00:12:23,875
I peed my kilt the first time I went into battle!

38
00:12:24,295 --> 00:12:28,125
Oh, aye. Angus pees his kilt all the time.

39
00:12:48,505 --> 00:12:51,755
Connor! Connor!

40
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:55,715
Connow, wait! Wait!

41
00:12:56,545 --> 00:12:59,045
Take these flowers and think of me.

42
00:13:02,235 --> 00:13:05,085
Remember, you fight with God on your side, Connor.

43
00:13:05,505 --> 00:13:09,465
A girl like that can wound a soldier
more than a Fraser's sword, my friend.

44
00:13:09,515 --> 00:13:12,125
Wait! Angus, you and Dugal keep him
in one piece, do you hear?

45
00:13:12,545 --> 00:13:15,295
Aye, we all know which piece that is!

46
00:13:59,675 --> 00:14:03,375
- There is one called Connor among them.
- Aye.

47
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:12,505
Remember our agreement, Murdoch.

48
00:14:12,925 --> 00:14:15,175
The boy is mine.

49
00:14:15,585 --> 00:14:17,925
It's begun.

50
00:14:18,335 --> 00:14:20,465
Death to the MacLeods!

51
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:23,380
<b>Death to the Macleods!</b>

52
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:33,995
<b>Death to the Frazers!</b>

53
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:57,375
MacLeod!

54
00:15:13,465 --> 00:15:14,425
Come on!

55
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:16,295
Macleod!

56
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:22,335
Stay under!

57
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,335
Forgive me,

58
00:15:25,755 --> 00:15:27,425
my son.

59
00:15:29,005 --> 00:15:30,545
Fight me, damn you!

60
00:15:30,965 --> 00:15:32,215
No, that's Connor MacLeod!

61
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,185
Fight me, you cowards!

62
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,247
No, not him!

63
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:43,875
Castrate the heathens!

64
00:15:44,335 --> 00:15:46,125
Nobody will fight me!

65
00:15:47,755 --> 00:15:48,715
They all run away.

66
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:51,215
Here, laddie, stay by me.

67
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,375
Mother of God!

68
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:06,875
Fight me!

69
00:16:20,295 --> 00:16:21,755
No!

70
00:16:23,425 --> 00:16:24,465
Come on, quick!

71
00:16:24,885 --> 00:16:26,755
There can be only one!

72
00:16:30,545 --> 00:16:31,875
Another time, MacLeod!

73
00:17:06,835 --> 00:17:09,835
- Get out of the car!
- Put your hands on the hood!

74
00:17:12,715 --> 00:17:14,705
- Move!
- Okay!

75
00:17:17,675 --> 00:17:21,135
- Watch it, freak! Just cool it! Watch him!
- Watch him, watch him!

76
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:24,469
Move! Come on, come on, come on! Move!

77
00:17:24,652 --> 00:17:27,135
Come on, come on!

78
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:31,335
Spread them! Spread them! Come on!

79
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:34,005
See some ID, pal!

80
00:17:37,465 --> 00:17:42,875
Well, Mr. Nash! Where were you going in such a hurry?

81
00:17:44,755 --> 00:17:46,875
Give me it! Give me it! Give me it!

82
00:17:53,215 --> 00:17:55,505
Don't move, pal.

83
00:17:55,925 --> 00:17:58,175
Don't even breathe.

84
00:18:46,005 --> 00:18:49,125
- It is over.
- No!

85
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:53,875
Other men are dying this day. I must attend them.

86
00:18:55,385 --> 00:18:56,505
Quiet!

87
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:04,965
He's a Highlander, by God!

88
00:19:05,385 --> 00:19:09,295
The last thing to hear should not be
that of a wailing woman!

89
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:36,255
Hey, come on. Let me through.

90
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:41,845
Damn it, Frank. Forensics are supposed
to be notified the same time as homicide!

91
00:19:42,465 --> 00:19:43,505
Holy shit!

92
00:19:44,005 --> 00:19:46,965
- Yeah, this one came unassembled.
- Did you made an arrest?

93
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:52,505
No. We're questioning some guy named Nash.
Antique dealer down on Hudson Street.

94
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:55,005
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hi, Walt.

95
00:19:55,965 --> 00:19:57,505
You look pretty, Brenda.

96
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:00,875
What do you think of the cause of death, Lieutenant, huh?

97
00:20:01,965 --> 00:20:04,295
Oh, Christ! You're a barrel of laughs, Garfield.

98
00:20:04,675 --> 00:20:06,235
Get your hands off!

99
00:20:06,675 --> 00:20:09,335
Hey, cop! When are you going to explain?
This was my wife's, man!

100
00:20:09,755 --> 00:20:12,635
Hey, Walker, get me a cherry-cheese Danish toast, please!

101
00:20:12,755 --> 00:20:15,335
What did they say? What time did he buy it?

102
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,125
Oh! About 10:00, 10:30.

103
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:19,215
Whatever made the cut was razor sharp.

104
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:23,335
Get out! I told you, you get out of here with these cameras!

105
00:20:23,485 --> 00:20:25,435
Frank! Frank!

106
00:20:25,505 --> 00:20:27,295
- Oh, my God!
- About two days ago, the telefax

107
00:20:27,415 --> 00:20:30,435
told that a guy was killed just like this over in Jersey.

108
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:33,085
Yeah, but I figured what the hell, that's Jersey!

109
00:20:33,235 --> 00:20:35,635
<i>Hey, coppers, I want to get out of here!</i>

110
00:20:35,755 --> 00:20:38,175
Hey Frank, come here!

111
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:41,545
Oh, shit!

112
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:46,175
Oh, baby, look at you!

113
00:20:47,215 --> 00:20:49,545
Garfield, cover that head.

114
00:20:55,255 --> 00:20:59,005
- What the hell have you got?
- A Toledo Salamanca.

115
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:03,625
- A what?
- A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

116
00:21:04,675 --> 00:21:07,925
- Well, is it worth much?
- Only about a million bucks.

117
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:14,625
Any antique dealer on Hudson Street could tell you that.

118
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:21,534
<i>You can't keep me here, asshole! I know my rights!</i>

119
00:21:50,755 --> 00:21:53,755
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

120
00:21:54,835 --> 00:21:57,135
The name's Vazilek. Polish national.

121
00:21:57,175 --> 00:22:00,375
Had his head chopped off in New Jersey two nights ago.

122
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:04,095
- You ever get over to New Jersey, Nash?
- Not if I can help it.

123
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:08,175
- You talk funny, Nash. Where're you from?
- Lots of different places.

124
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:11,295
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hm.

125
00:22:11,715 --> 00:22:13,925
Okay. What's that?

126
00:22:19,335 --> 00:22:22,125
- A sword?
- Wise up, smart ass!

127
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:28,285
That's a Toledo Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million dollars.

128
00:22:28,335 --> 00:22:29,255
So?

129
00:22:29,675 --> 00:22:32,135
- So, you want to hear a theory?
- Mm-hm.

130
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,965
You went down that garage to buy this sword from that guy.

131
00:22:35,005 --> 00:22:37,545
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

132
00:22:37,965 --> 00:22:40,435
Okay. His name is Iman Fasil.

133
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:42,585
You fought about the price and cut off his head.

134
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:46,585
Want to hear another theory?

135
00:22:47,005 --> 00:22:50,875
This Fasil was so upset about the lousy wrestling tonight,

136
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:55,175
he went down to the garage and in a fit
of depression cut off his own head.

137
00:22:56,465 --> 00:22:58,295
That's not funny, Walt.

138
00:22:59,135 --> 00:23:00,455
You a faggot, Nash?

139
00:23:00,535 --> 00:23:03,255
Why Garfield? You're cruising for a piece of ass?

140
00:23:05,505 --> 00:23:07,545
I'll tell you what happened, Russell.

141
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,635
You went down to the garage for a blow job.

142
00:23:10,835 --> 00:23:12,295
You just didn't want to pay for it.

143
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,255
Huh. You are sick.

144
00:23:16,592 --> 00:23:17,924
Hey! Hey!

145
00:23:18,007 --> 00:23:19,305
Hey, what are you doing?

146
00:23:20,288 --> 00:23:21,554
Stop! Stop it!

147
00:23:21,637 --> 00:23:24,293
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

148
00:23:24,377 --> 00:23:27,690
That's enough! That's it! Now, cut it out!

149
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,496
Goddamn it, I said cut it out!

150
00:23:32,085 --> 00:23:34,335
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

151
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:38,585
- Then we're through.
- Nash, we're just getting started!

152
00:23:41,835 --> 00:23:43,875
<i>...garage and water from the sprinkler.</i>

153
00:23:44,295 --> 00:23:47,835
<i>It also left a man's decapitated body</i>

154
00:23:47,935 --> 00:23:51,335

155

Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger. Room 315.

164
00:24:35,255 --> 00:24:38,175
And I'm going to hit you for twenty in advance.

165
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:50,835
If there's anything you need, you know,
broads or blow, just dial 0, huh?

166
00:24:51,335 --> 00:24:56,175
That's right, Mr. Kruger. Lucky Strike
means fine tobacco. I'll tell you that.

167
00:24:56,585 --> 00:25:00,085
- Don't talk to the guests!
- I didn't do nothin'!

168
00:25:52,005 --> 00:25:53,925
At last!

169
00:25:54,385 --> 00:25:56,005
The Gathering!

170
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,425
Hi!

171
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:02,875
I'm Candy.

172
00:26:06,715 --> 00:26:08,715
Of course you are.

173
00:26:18,885 --> 00:26:20,215
Come on in.

174
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:22,635
- Hiya.
- Hi.

175
00:26:22,755 --> 00:26:25,715
- Got a present for you from the coroner.
- Yeah, what's that?

176
00:26:26,135 --> 00:26:29,045
Pieces of metal. Found them
on the dead guy under the Garden.

177
00:26:29,835 --> 00:26:31,875
In the wound and on the clothes.

178
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:34,675
Real smooth shave.

179
00:26:51,675 --> 00:26:52,965
That can't be right.

180
00:26:58,585 --> 00:27:00,045
Son of a bitch!

181
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:00,215
Who's there?

182
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:22,295
- Hey, Brenda. The usual?
- Lots of it.

183
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:28,545
Say when.

184
00:28:32,965 --> 00:28:34,125
When.

185
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:39,325
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

186
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:42,335
A double Glenmorangie on the rocks.

187
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:44,675
Glenmorangie? Right.

188
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:48,875
- Go to the Garden often?
- What did you say?

189
00:28:59,755 --> 00:29:01,545
What did you say?

190
00:29:03,505 --> 00:29:05,795
Madison Square Garden.

191
00:29:08,175 --> 00:29:09,755
Do you go there often?

192
00:29:10,175 --> 00:29:11,255
Why?

193
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:14,335
Basketball,

194
00:29:14,755 --> 00:29:16,505
the circus, wrestling...

195
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,835
Why are you asking me about the Garden?
Have you been following me?

196
00:29:22,045 --> 00:29:25,085
I'd like to walk you home, Brenda.

197
00:29:32,045 --> 00:29:34,425
I can take care of myself.

Here, take this.

204
00:31:40,585 --> 00:31:42,535
Nice to see you again, Mcleod.

205
00:31:42,835 --> 00:31:44,425
Nice yourself.

206
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:50,125
- Stop!
- There can be only one!

207
00:31:54,085 --> 00:31:55,295
No!

208
00:31:59,545 --> 00:32:02,715
<i>Hey, you, on the ground. This is the police!</i>

209
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:06,635
<i>Put down your weapons. Put your hands on your heads.</i>

210
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:10,085
Another time, Highlander. I will find you!

211
00:32:11,635 --> 00:32:14,505
<i>Hey! Hold it right there! Come back here!</i>

212
00:32:18,505 --> 00:32:20,545
Stop! Wait a minute!

213
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:22,635
Who in the name of God was that?

214
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:24,635
He called you Highlander. What did he mean?

215
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:25,935
"There can only be one." Only one what?

216
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,035
Listen, lady, you almost...

217
00:32:27,085 --> 00:32:29,635
- I want to know...
- Shut up!

218
00:32:30,835 --> 00:32:32,875
Don't you ever follow me again.

219
00:32:33,295 --> 00:32:36,505
You only have one life. If you value it...

220
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,675
go home.

221
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:53,625
You saw the wound, Angus.

222
00:32:54,505 --> 00:32:57,625
- He should have died.
- I say he's got the devil in him!

223
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,085
Drinking with us, are you?

224
00:33:21,505 --> 00:33:25,125
- What's the matter, Dougal?
- You, talking and breathing.

225
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,255
Last night all but a corpse.

226
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:30,235
How did you manage that, Connor Mcloed?

227
00:33:30,275 --> 00:33:31,595
Would you rather I was dead?

228
00:33:31,715 --> 00:33:34,125
It's not natural.

229
00:33:37,045 --> 00:33:38,675
He's in league with Lucifer.

230
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:41,425
Don't say that, Kate!

231
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:45,965
I'll say it! You've the devil in you.

232
00:33:47,135 --> 00:33:49,125
We've been kinsmen 20 years!

233
00:33:49,885 --> 00:33:54,965
Connor MacLeod was my kinsman. I don't know who you are.

234
00:34:01,465 --> 00:34:03,835
- Angus.
- You'd better go, Connor.

235
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,715
I'm not going anywhere.

236
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:10,965
He's the devil! Kill him!

237
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:36,135
- Dougal!
- Leave him be!

238
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:37,657
Dougal...

239
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:39,295
Go on, kill him!

240
00:34:40,965 --> 00:34:42,795
He's your cousin, man!

241
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:52,925
No, Angus!

242
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:56,005
Quiet! Quiet!

243
00:34:57,545 --> 00:34:59,835
There'll be no burning here today.

244
00:35:00,385 --> 00:35:02,045
We'll banish him.

245
00:35:02,465 --> 00:35:05,045
No! Burn him!

246
00:35:09,385 --> 00:35:10,795
Burn him!

247
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:14,085
- Can you walk?
- I'll bloody well walk out of here.

248
00:35:14,465 --> 00:35:16,795
Then go, while you still can!

249
00:35:18,385 --> 00:35:20,965
I'll not forget you, Angus.

250
00:37:29,835 --> 00:37:31,465
That's a good dog.

251
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,755
- Pie and ale, do you want it?
- Aye.

252
00:37:42,875 --> 00:37:44,545
Right now!

253
00:37:46,635 --> 00:37:49,085
You filthy sod! You're all muck and muscle.

254
00:37:49,505 --> 00:37:52,965
Aye, blossom. The way you like it.

255
00:38:14,505 --> 00:38:18,295
You can do that to me forever, if you like, my Lord.

256
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:24,795
- Will you, Connor?
- Aye, blossom. I will.

257
00:38:31,545 --> 00:38:32,585
Hello!

258
00:38:38,795 --> 00:38:40,005
Greetings.

259
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:44,625
I am Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez,

260
00:38:45,045 --> 00:38:47,925
chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain,

261
00:38:48,335 --> 00:38:50,335
and I'm at your service.

262
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:52,255
Who?

263
00:38:57,255 --> 00:38:59,965
- What do you want?
- You.

264
00:39:03,335 --> 00:39:05,135
You're Connor MacLeod.

265
00:39:05,335 --> 00:39:07,005
- Maybe I am...
- You're Connor MacLeod,

266
00:39:07,425 --> 00:39:09,135
wounded in battle

267
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:11,485
and driven from your village of Glenfinnan

268
00:39:11,785 --> 00:39:13,295
five years ago.

269
00:39:14,135 --> 00:39:14,965
Connor!

270
00:39:16,635 --> 00:39:19,135
Heather, go in the house.

271
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:20,305
I'll stay right here.

272
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,375
Do as I say, woman!

273
00:39:36,585 --> 00:39:38,545
The sensation you're feeling

274
00:39:39,505 --> 00:39:41,425
is the Quickening.

275
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,295
- Who are you?
- We are the same, MacLeod.

276
00:39:48,465 --> 00:39:50,795
We are brothers!

277
00:39:57,715 --> 00:40:00,505
I knew you guys were bottle-fed.

278
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:05,755
Yeah, well, there's not a hell of a lot
I can do about it, pal.

279
00:40:06,295 --> 00:40:07,875
You see what I'm up against!

280
00:40:08,295 --> 00:40:11,255
His Vietnamese neighbor ate his dog.

281
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:14,435
That's confidential.

282
00:40:14,835 --> 00:40:17,755
- How are things over at forensics?
- Dull.

283
00:40:18,175 --> 00:40:22,035
- How about some lunch?
- Lunch? It's a good idea. Who pays?

284
00:40:22,135 --> 00:40:24,125
- Me.
- You're on.

285
00:40:24,545 --> 00:40:26,135
- Oh, by the way, Frank.
- Yeah.

286
00:40:26,185 --> 00:40:27,935
- The hairs in the Moretti case?
- Uh-huh.

287
00:40:27,985 --> 00:40:30,135
- They matched up.
- What did I tell you?

288
00:40:30,635 --> 00:40:32,125
Oh! I forgot my purse.

289
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:34,215
I'll meet you outside.

290
00:40:35,175 --> 00:40:37,965
Garfield, Brenda and I are going to lunch.

Crude and slow, clansman. Your attack

That is a perfect way to start.

326
00:44:27,425 --> 00:44:30,465
Tell me, how did it happen for God's sake?

327
00:44:33,835 --> 00:44:36,425
Why does the sun come up? Hmm?

328
00:44:37,465 --> 00:44:42,505
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night? Who knows?

329
00:44:43,545 --> 00:44:47,465
What I do know is that because you were born different,

330
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:51,255
men will fear you, try to drive you away,

331
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:53,545
like the people of your village.

332
00:45:04,675 --> 00:45:07,965
You must learn to conceal your special gift

333
00:45:08,385 --> 00:45:10,505
and harness your power

334
00:45:10,925 --> 00:45:13,505
until the time of the Gathering.

335
00:45:16,465 --> 00:45:18,005
What Gathering?

336
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:20,375
When only a few of us are left,

337
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:25,875
we will feel an irresistible pull towards a faraway land

338
00:45:26,295 --> 00:45:28,835
to fight for the prize.

339
00:45:31,635 --> 00:45:32,795
Come on!

340
00:45:34,085 --> 00:45:35,295
Faster!

341
00:45:44,835 --> 00:45:46,925
Never lose your temper.

342
00:45:48,755 --> 00:45:51,925
If your head comes away from your neck, it's over.

343
00:46:18,005 --> 00:46:19,835
Never overextend your thrust.

344
00:46:20,465 --> 00:46:24,255
You're vulnerable and off balance.

345
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:26,335
Connor!

346
00:46:28,135 --> 00:46:29,875
Heather, please!

347
00:46:42,635 --> 00:46:47,215
If it came down to just us two, would you take my head?

348
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:56,255
We must fight until only one remains.

349
00:46:56,675 --> 00:47:01,085
You're safe only on holy ground.
None of us will violate that law.

350
00:47:01,505 --> 00:47:03,215
It's tradition.

351
00:47:16,255 --> 00:47:18,425
Now for the last.

352
00:47:19,465 --> 00:47:21,005
Trust me.

353
00:47:24,175 --> 00:47:26,675
Let yourself feel the stag.

354
00:47:29,965 --> 00:47:33,255
His heart... beating,

355
00:47:40,585 --> 00:47:42,125
his blood...

356
00:47:42,545 --> 00:47:43,585
coursing.

357
00:47:43,965 --> 00:47:45,625
Feel?

358
00:47:47,005 --> 00:47:49,255
- Come on!
- I feel him.

359
00:47:51,335 --> 00:47:54,135
MacLeod, come on!

360
00:47:54,715 --> 00:47:57,255
- I feel him!
- Come on!

361
00:48:00,385 --> 00:48:02,545
I feel him!

362
00:48:06,835 --> 00:48:09,085
Come on, Haggis!

363
00:48:17,635 --> 00:48:20,135
- Yeah!
- Yes!

364
00:48:53,425 --> 00:48:58,755
Now, Pendejo, shall we see
what sort of swordsman you've become?

365
00:48:59,175 --> 00:49:00,585
En garde!

366
00:49:09,175 --> 00:49:10,085
Very good.

367
00:49:29,135 --> 00:49:31,215
Give me your hand, brother.

368
00:49:48,135 --> 00:49:51,125
That one there. How much is it?

369
00:50:08,925 --> 00:50:10,215
Put him in.

370
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:12,465
But what I want is a family.

371
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:16,675
You cannot have a family. We cannot have children.

372
00:50:19,005 --> 00:50:22,375
That won't please Heather. I'll tell you that for nothing.

373
00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:26,545
He's full of life.

374
00:50:28,585 --> 00:50:29,625
Connor!

375
00:50:32,635 --> 00:50:34,545
Here's dinner.

376
00:50:36,545 --> 00:50:39,755
I'll be off now. I fancy buying myself a new dress.

377
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:46,425
Oh, you little devils. Go on!

378
00:50:48,925 --> 00:50:50,675
She is beautiful.

379
00:50:52,465 --> 00:50:54,755
You must leave her, brother.

380
00:51:06,385 --> 00:51:07,505
MacLeod,

381
00:51:08,715 --> 00:51:11,835
I was born 2,437 years ago.

382
00:51:12,885 --> 00:51:15,215
In that time I've had 3 wives.

383
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:18,545
The last was Shakiko, a Japanese princess.

384
00:51:18,965 --> 00:51:23,585
Her father, Masamune, a genius, made this for me.

385
00:51:24,635 --> 00:51:26,965
In 593 B.C.

386
00:51:28,635 --> 00:51:30,425
It is the only one of its kind,

387
00:51:32,295 --> 00:51:34,125
like his daughter.

388
00:51:35,635 --> 00:51:38,215
When Shakiko died, I was shattered.

389
00:51:38,635 --> 00:51:40,795
I would save you that pain.

390
00:51:41,585 --> 00:51:43,925
Please, let Heather go.

391
00:52:02,545 --> 00:52:07,335
When we first met, you felt ill, remember?

392
00:52:08,715 --> 00:52:11,975
That wasn't the first time you felt that sensation, was it?

393
00:52:12,015 --> 00:52:13,035
No.

394
00:52:13,335 --> 00:52:17,215
When the MacLeods fought the Frasers, and a black knight...

395
00:52:18,925 --> 00:52:20,185
I felt it then.

396
00:52:20,635 --> 00:52:22,545
Only it was different, more painful.

397
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:28,125
That black knight was the Kurgan.
It's because of him that I sought you out.

398
00:52:30,675 --> 00:52:33,425
Who is the Kurgan? And where does he come from?

399
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:37,255
The Kurgans were an ancient people
from the steppes of Russia.

400
00:52:37,675 --> 00:52:43,045
For amusement they tossed children
into pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat.

401
00:52:43,465 --> 00:52:47,585
The Kurgan. He is the strongest of all the Immortals.

402
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:50,715
He is the perfect warrior.

403
00:52:51,465 --> 00:52:56,255
If he wins the prize, mortal man
would suffer an eternity of darkness.

404
00:52:57,885 --> 00:52:59,835
How do you fight such a savage?

405
00:53:01,335 --> 00:53:04,795
With heart, faith and steel.

406
00:53:05,215 --> 00:53:08,125
In the end, there can be only one.

407
00:53:13,255 --> 00:53:15,435
It must have been very dangerous for you.

408
00:53:15,535 --> 00:53:18,295
Well, I was very much in love with her, my dear Heather.

409
00:53:18,715 --> 00:53:21,925
She was the only thing on my mind, not danger.

410
00:53:22,335 --> 00:53:26,215
So, holding the rose in my teeth,
I climbed up on the rooftop,

411
00:53:26,635 --> 00:53:30,835
lowered a rope and swung in through the open window.

412
00:53:33,385 --> 00:53:37,875
- Unfortunately, the lady was no longer there.
- What did you do?

413
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:41,505
I introduced myself to the lady that was there.

414
00:53:41,925 --> 00:53:44,175
She was most helpful.

415
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:48,425
Would you like some more wine?

416
00:53:48,835 --> 00:53:50,255
Yes, please.

417
00:54:02,675 --> 00:54:05,715
- Heather, get out.
- What's wrong?

418
00:54:11,795 --> 00:54:12,545
Get out!

419
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:17,505
Kurgan!

420
00:54:19,255 --> 00:54:20,715
Ramírez!

421
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:33,715
The Highlander, where is he?

422
00:54:34,215 --> 00:54:38,675
- You're too late. I've prepared him for you.
- You waste your time!

423
00:55:05,835 --> 00:55:06,715
It hurts?

424
00:55:20,675 --> 00:55:22,505
Now you die!

425
00:55:28,005 --> 00:55:30,835
You cannot win, Ramírez. I'm the strongest!

426
00:55:31,215 --> 00:55:33,175
My cut has improved your voice.

427
00:57:15,385 --> 00:57:16,585
Yes!

428
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:50,755
Hurts?

429
00:57:54,835 --> 00:57:56,715
Who is the woman?

430
00:57:59,385 --> 00:58:00,925
She's mine.

431
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:04,215
Not for much longer.

432
00:58:14,085 --> 00:58:16,675
Tonight you sleep in hell.

433
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,425
There can be only one!

434
00:59:06,675 --> 00:59:08,835
Hello, pretty!

435
00:59:19,885 --> 00:59:21,435
I'd like to speak to Russell Nash.

436
00:59:21,885 --> 00:59:24,295
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Nash isn't here at the moment.

437
00:59:24,715 --> 00:59:26,835
May I call him at home? I have to talk to him today.

438
00:59:27,135 --> 00:59:29,335
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

439
00:59:30,215 --> 00:59:34,425
- Good morning.
- This is Brenda Wyatt, Mr. Nash.

440
00:59:35,755 --> 00:59:39,505
We've already met, Rachel. What can I do for you?

441
00:59:39,925 --> 00:59:41,425
I'd like some advice.

442
00:59:41,925 --> 00:59:44,435
Are you the kind of woman who takes advice?

443
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:47,545
- That depends.
- Advice about what?

444
00:59:48,425 --> 00:59:51,335
What can you tell me about a 7" lunatic
hacking away with a broadsword

445
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:54,425
at 1 o'clock in the morning in Ney York city, 1985?

446
00:59:57,465 --> 00:59:58,335
Not much.

447
00:59:58,755 --> 01:00:01,535
What about a Japanese sword dated 600 B.C.? 375

448
01:00:01,735 --> 01:00:04,235
The metal in the blade folded 200 times.

449
01:00:04,925 --> 01:00:07,005
I don't deal in exotic weapons.

450
01:00:07,635 --> 01:00:10,715
Can I show you something in 18th century silver?

451
01:00:11,335 --> 01:00:14,465
That's not why I came here, and you know it.

452
01:00:15,635 --> 01:00:18,335
- Do you cook?
- Why?

453
01:00:18,835 --> 01:00:21,005
I thought we might have dinner.

454
01:00:21,545 --> 01:00:23,055
- Did you?
- Yes.

455
01:00:26,215 --> 01:00:31,715
So, I'm standing there, and there's Brenda!
Our little Brenda.

456
01:00:32,135 --> 01:00:34,005
You're sure it was Brenda?

457
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,965
She was in Nash's shop. She was talking to him.

458
01:00:46,505 --> 01:00:51,125
- What are you looking at, Rachel?
- The eyes in the back of your head.

459
01:00:53,135 --> 01:00:57,715
People are asking about you. What am I supposed to say?

460
01:01:00,255 --> 01:01:02,585
Tell them I'm Immortal.

461
01:01:02,885 --> 01:01:05,795
Attention! Four men over here!

462
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:40,175
Quiet.

463
01:01:46,005 --> 01:01:47,375
Don't be afraid.

464
01:01:47,925 --> 01:01:50,005
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

465
01:01:50,425 --> 01:01:53,715
- What happened?
- Everybody is dead.

466
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,335
I'm like you. I'm alone.

467
01:01:59,755 --> 01:02:01,715
Come with me, Rachel.

468
01:02:16,175 --> 01:02:21,925
- You're alive! Why didn't you die?
- Hey, it's a kind of magic.

469
01:02:26,255 --> 01:02:28,335
- You should be dead!
- Move!

470
01:02:28,885 --> 01:02:31,505
No! You'll have to shoot me first.

471
01:02:32,385 --> 01:02:35,885
Whatever you say, Jack. You're the master race.

472
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:41,675
Let's go.

473
01:02:43,635 --> 01:02:45,505
That was a long time ago.

474
01:02:46,425 --> 01:02:49,255
Would you listen to me for one moment, please?

475
01:02:50,465 --> 01:02:54,335
You can't hide your feelings from me.
I've known you too long.

476
01:02:54,755 --> 01:02:58,045
- What feelings?
- How about loneliness?

477
01:02:58,635 --> 01:03:00,715
I'm not lonely.

478
01:03:01,335 --> 01:03:05,295
- I've got everything I need right here.
- Oh no, you don't.

479
01:03:07,175 --> 01:03:10,215
You refuse to let anyone love you.

480
01:03:11,255 --> 01:03:12,875
Love is for poets.

481
01:03:17,505 --> 01:03:20,125
You're such a romantic, Rachel.

482
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:23,175
You always were.

483
01:03:45,635 --> 01:03:47,255
Just a minute!

484
01:04:06,465 --> 01:04:07,625
Good evening.

485
01:04:12,835 --> 01:04:16,175
Do you want to dine in the hall, or shall we step inside?

486
01:04:18,635 --> 01:04:20,425
Come in.

487
01:04:22,045 --> 01:04:23,335
May I take your coat?

488
01:04:23,385 --> 01:04:24,665
- No thanks.
- What?

489
01:04:24,885 --> 01:04:27,755
- I'll hold on to it.
- Oh, fine.

490
01:04:32,215 --> 01:04:34,835
- Where are you going?
- I forgot my earrings.

491
01:04:35,255 --> 01:04:38,795
Make yourself a drink. There are glasses in the bar.

492
01:04:51,215 --> 01:04:52,925
Do you know what you're doing?

493
01:05:14,715 --> 01:05:16,375
I like your place, Brenda.

494
01:05:16,795 --> 01:05:20,625
I've only been here 3 months. I'm still cleaning it up.

495
01:05:25,085 --> 01:05:28,255
- Interesting view.
- What did you say?

496
01:05:33,925 --> 01:05:36,375
I said, "interesting view".

497
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:38,125
Isn't it great?

498
01:05:45,505 --> 01:05:48,675
You never told me what you do for a living.

499
01:05:49,635 --> 01:05:53,215
I work for the Metropolitan Museum.

500
01:05:55,045 --> 01:05:56,505
In Aquisitions.

501
01:05:59,465 --> 01:06:02,125
That explains your interest in ancient weapons.

502
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,215
Right.

503
01:06:07,175 --> 01:06:09,255
Especially the Samurai.

504
01:06:10,545 --> 01:06:11,875
Very nice.

505
01:06:12,795 --> 01:06:15,755
- Shall we have a toast?
- Yes.

506
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:22,295
Brandy.

507
01:06:23,335 --> 01:06:25,715
Bottled in 1783.

508
01:06:26,135 --> 01:06:27,835
Wow! That's old.

509
01:06:30,755 --> 01:06:33,295
1783 was a very good year.

510
01:06:35,635 --> 01:06:38,215
Mozart wrote his Great Mass.

511
01:06:39,925 --> 01:06:44,255
The Montgolfier Brothers went up in their first balloon.

512
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:52,335
And England recognized
the independence of the United States.

513
01:06:52,755 --> 01:06:54,125
Is that right?

514
01:06:55,175 --> 01:06:56,085
Yes.

515
01:07:03,755 --> 01:07:05,375
What's that?

516
01:07:06,545 --> 01:07:09,235
- It's for you.
- Can I open it?

517
01:07:09,335 --> 01:07:10,585
If you like.

518
01:07:25,295 --> 01:07:27,585
You bastard! Where did you find this?

519
01:07:28,005 --> 01:07:30,625
I have an extensive library.

520
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:35,545
Odd thing, your bio doesn't mention the Met.

521
01:07:35,965 --> 01:07:39,835
It says you work for the police. In forensics.

522
01:07:40,255 --> 01:07:44,045
- Are you and Moran trying to set me up?
- I don't work for Moran.

523
01:07:44,465 --> 01:07:48,965
Then why is that bald policeman sitting
outside watching your apartment?

524
01:07:50,585 --> 01:07:52,875
You remember him. Moran's had him tailing me.

525
01:07:53,295 --> 01:07:54,925
What're you gonna do?

526
01:07:55,885 --> 01:07:57,935
The question is what are you gonna do?

527
01:07:58,135 --> 01:08:01,005
You're going to turn off the tape
or you're going to shoot me with the .45?

528
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:09,035
I am not looking for a killer. I am looking
for a sword, the one used on Fasil.

529
01:08:09,135 --> 01:08:10,835
I found pieces of it under the Garden.

530
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:12,675
- I only want to see the Samurai.
- Why?

531
01:08:13,085 --> 01:08:15,435
I told you! Because it's not supposed to exist!

532
01:08:15,885 --> 01:08:20,135
I dated pieces of the blade at 600 B.C.
The metal had been folded 200 times.

533
01:08:20,185 --> 01:08:22,375
The Japanese didn't start making
swords like that till the Middle Ages.

534
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:25,085
So where the hell did it come from?

535
01:08:25,505 --> 01:08:28,535
If I could verify the existence
of such a weapon, it would be like...

536
01:08:28,935 --> 01:08:33,005
discovering 747 a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

537
01:08:34,085 --> 01:08:35,425
This is crazy.

538
01:08:35,835 --> 01:08:39,295
Wait a minute, Nash, I want some answers.

539
01:08:40,335 --> 01:08:41,925
You want?

540
01:08:42,925 --> 01:08:45,925
Don't you ever think about anything except what you want?

541
01:09:00,925 --> 01:09:03,255

My husband.

561
01:11:14,385 --> 01:11:16,505
I am that, my love.

562
01:11:20,585 --> 01:11:23,005
I've never really known...

563
01:11:24,175 --> 01:11:25,295
What?

564
01:11:26,965 --> 01:11:29,005
Why you stayed.

565
01:11:31,255 --> 01:11:34,875
Because I love you as much now as the first day we met.

566
01:11:37,925 --> 01:11:39,675
And I love you.

567
01:11:44,425 --> 01:11:46,125
I don't want to die.

568
01:11:47,295 --> 01:11:49,215
I want to stay with you.

569
01:11:49,635 --> 01:11:51,045
Forever.

570
01:11:51,465 --> 01:11:53,125
I want that, too.

571
01:11:54,635 --> 01:11:57,215
Will you do something for me, Connor?

572
01:11:59,585 --> 01:12:01,375
What, blossom?

573
01:12:02,505 --> 01:12:08,045
In the years to come, will you light a candle
and remember me on my birthday?

574
01:12:09,385 --> 01:12:10,835
Aye, love.

575
01:12:11,255 --> 01:12:12,755
I will.

576
01:12:13,675 --> 01:12:16,125
I wanted to have your children.

577
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:20,625
They would have been strong and fine.

578
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:27,715
Don't see me, Connor.

579
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,375
Let me die in peace.

580
01:12:33,005 --> 01:12:34,465
Where are we?

581
01:12:41,795 --> 01:12:43,835
We're in the Highlands.

582
01:12:46,715 --> 01:12:47,965
Where else?

583
01:12:51,675 --> 01:12:54,175
Running down a mountain side.

584
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:09,875
The sun is shining.

585
01:13:11,675 --> 01:13:13,255
It's not cold.

586
01:13:15,255 --> 01:13:17,835
You've got your sheepskins on.

587
01:13:21,675 --> 01:13:24,795
And the boots I made for you.

588
01:13:27,885 --> 01:13:30,125
Goodnight, my bonny Heather.

589
01:13:45,465 --> 01:13:47,425
Hey, Kastagir!

590
01:13:49,925 --> 01:13:53,175
MacLeod. It's good to see you again.

591
01:13:53,585 --> 01:13:55,755
It seems like a hundred years.

592
01:13:56,175 --> 01:13:57,835
It's been a hundred years.

593
01:14:06,215 --> 01:14:07,795
How've you been?

594
01:14:09,135 --> 01:14:10,135
Hey!

595
01:14:10,585 --> 01:14:11,535
This...

596
01:14:13,045 --> 01:14:15,215
...puts hairs on your chest.

597
01:14:18,255 --> 01:14:20,715
- What is it?
- Boom-boom!

598
01:14:21,795 --> 01:14:25,085
A big strong man like you shouldn't
be afraid of a little boom-boom!

599
01:14:25,465 --> 01:14:29,965
- Or maybe you think I'm trying to poison you?
- I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

600
01:14:32,435 --> 01:14:34,925
So, the Gathering is here.

601
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:42,755
- Time has almost caught us, my friend.
- Has it? You think we should go on?

602
01:14:45,215 --> 01:14:47,175
I think we should have a party.

603
01:14:47,585 --> 01:14:50,535
Oh no! I remember the last time we had a party.

604
01:14:50,685 --> 01:14:52,835
Really, when exactly was that?

605
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:54,965
It was 1783.

606
01:14:55,385 --> 01:14:57,705
1783...

607
01:14:58,295 --> 01:15:02,085
Oh yes! Your famous duel on Boston Common.

608
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,425
You were drunk.

609
01:15:04,495 --> 01:15:07,495
- What was that guy's name again?
- His name was Bassett.

610
01:15:07,545 --> 01:15:10,085
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett! I implore you!

611
01:15:10,135 --> 01:15:12,085
I am fighting the duel, Hotchkiss, not you!

612
01:15:14,085 --> 01:15:15,875
See if the imbecile is ready.

613
01:15:16,675 --> 01:15:20,375
- Mr. Bassett is waiting, Sir.
- Tell him I'm ready.

614
01:15:20,835 --> 01:15:22,835
Christ, I've gone blind!

615
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:25,295
En garde, Sir!

616
01:15:29,675 --> 01:15:33,085
- Wonderful, Sir.
- Thank you, Hotchkiss.

617
01:15:34,005 --> 01:15:37,125
Bassett, is that you?

618
01:15:37,585 --> 01:15:39,335
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

619
01:16:00,675 --> 01:16:01,585
Stop, Sir!

620
01:16:02,005 --> 01:16:03,505
I beseech...

621
01:16:03,925 --> 01:16:08,145
I apologize for calling your wife a bloated warthog.

622
01:16:09,675 --> 01:16:11,965
And I bid you a good day.

623
01:16:14,635 --> 01:16:16,235
- Shoot him, Sir?
- What?

624
01:16:16,285 --> 01:16:18,375
Shoot him. Now, Sir. Now, Sir.
In the back of the head. Now, Sir!

625
01:16:18,795 --> 01:16:21,795
Hotchkiss! Hotchkiss, stop it!

626
01:16:23,505 --> 01:16:25,925
- Hotchkiss...
- Sir?

627
01:16:26,335 --> 01:16:27,875
No, Sir.

628
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:38,335
<i>That's the mood of New York at this moment.</i>

629
01:16:38,755 --> 01:16:42,175
- Get out of here! Get out of here!
- <i>An angry city in the grip of fear.</i>

630
01:16:49,051 --> 01:16:51,565
<i>Earlier today, in response to growing pressure,</i>

631
01:16:51,606 --> 01:16:54,062
<i>the mayor's office issued the following statement.</i>

632
01:16:54,135 --> 01:16:57,175
- Give us a drink, pal.
- Got a joint?

633
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,357
<i>Police departments are continuing the vigorous investigation</i>

634
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:02,295
<i>following up on a number of promising leads.</i>

635
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,425
Hey, Rockefeller.

636
01:17:03,835 --> 01:17:08,175
How'd you like Candy? She said you were kind of kinky, huh?

637
01:17:10,135 --> 01:17:12,335
Don't ever speak to me.

638
01:17:18,335 --> 01:17:19,715
Look, I didn't mean...

639
01:17:21,835 --> 01:17:26,335
Don't ever speak to me again!

640
01:17:26,755 --> 01:17:28,505
Do you understand?

641
01:17:30,585 --> 01:17:32,215
Good.

642
01:17:37,005 --> 01:17:40,505
I hope you get your head chopped off, asshole!

643
01:17:42,545 --> 01:17:45,425
And you! Shut it!

644
01:18:07,768 --> 01:18:10,307
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

645
01:18:18,925 --> 01:18:19,875
What the hell?

646
01:18:34,005 --> 01:18:36,465
Okay, Marine, this is for real.

647
01:18:42,285 --> 01:18:43,435
Let's go!

648
01:18:47,215 --> 01:18:49,335
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on, come on!

649
01:19:01,925 --> 01:19:03,965
What the hell's going on?!

650
01:20:58,335 --> 01:20:59,375
For God's sake.

651
01:21:12,045 --> 01:21:13,425
Look at that!

652
01:21:51,675 --> 01:21:53,125
Mother of God...

653
01:21:57,585 --> 01:21:58,835
Mom!

654
01:22:04,005 --> 01:22:06,375
Hey, where're you going with my car?

655
01:22:06,795 --> 01:22:10,085
Daddy, help me! Daddy! Daddy, help me!

656
01:22:19,425 --> 01:22:21,135
Frank! Will you take it easy?

657
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:24,675
I'm telling you, I checked everywhere with
everybody. There just aren't any witnesses!

658
01:22:25,635 --> 01:22:27,055
That's New York for you!

659
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,625
Twenty people standing around, nobody saw a goddamn thing.

660
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:32,835
Tell me about this Matunas. What is he, on drugs?

661
01:22:32,885 --> 01:22:33,505
He's a survival man.

662
01:22:33,545 --> 01:22:36,535
- What do you mean "survival man"?
- He's into guns. He was a Marine in Vietnam.

663
01:22:36,585 --> 01:22:41,125
I talked to his ex-CO. He said that the guy
was a little paranoid, but he was good a man.

664
01:22:43,795 --> 01:22:46,135
- How're you doing, kid?
- Okay, I guess.

665
01:22:46,185 --> 01:22:49,795
For a guy who had 3 feet of steel crammed
through his gut. How're you doing old man?

666
01:22:50,635 --> 01:22:53,335
I understand you saw the guy that stuck you, is that right?

667
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:55,255
You're kidding me, man.

668
01:22:55,675 --> 01:22:57,215
Is that him?

669
01:22:57,715 --> 01:22:58,465
Nope.

670
01:22:59,885 --> 01:23:02,235
Come on, quit kidding, Matunas. It was dark in that alley!

671
01:23:02,285 --> 01:23:03,875
The freak was trying to kill me!

672
01:23:04,295 --> 01:23:09,425
I'll never forget his face. He had a scar
across his neck. That ain't him.

673
01:23:09,835 --> 01:23:10,965
Shit!

674
01:23:13,925 --> 01:23:15,965
- Depressed?
- Yeah.

675
01:23:17,385 --> 01:23:19,795
You don't know grunt about depressed.

676
01:23:20,215 --> 01:23:24,515
I got me a .357, I got me a trunk load of shotguns,

677
01:23:24,635 --> 01:23:27,795
I got three big-bore rifles, and ammo up the ass.

678
01:23:28,385 --> 01:23:31,335
And I ain't safe. I can't protect myself!

679
01:23:31,425 --> 01:23:33,675
Okay, Take it easy, pal. Take it easy!

680
01:23:33,885 --> 01:23:36,675
That weirdo, man. He got up,

681
01:23:37,085 --> 01:23:41,255
after I'd put enough lead in him to drop a rhino.

682
01:23:41,675 --> 01:23:44,915
Hey, listen, listen. You think you could
work with one of our artists,

683
01:23:44,965 --> 01:23:47,235
maybe come up with a picture of this guy?

684
01:23:47,335 --> 01:23:49,675
Sure. Sure. Yes.

685
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,295
Take it easy, pal.

686
01:23:53,425 --> 01:23:55,295
- Hey, cop!
- Yeah?

687
01:23:55,715 --> 01:23:57,755
I know you guys think I'm nuts,

688
01:23:59,175 --> 01:24:00,795
but there's something else I gotta tell you.

689
01:24:01,675 --> 01:24:04,255
After he threw me against the wall...

690
01:24:23,755 --> 01:24:25,835
- This is getting like "One Step Beyond".
- Yeah.

691
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:28,205
Listen, when we get out there, remember.
All we've got is an eye-witness.

692
01:24:28,255 --> 01:24:30,635
Now, don't say anything about swordfights in New York city,

693
01:24:30,685 --> 01:24:32,535
or guys glowing in the dark for Christ's sake.

694
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:36,135
Hey, Moran!

695
01:24:36,505 --> 01:24:38,505
Have you read what it says in here?

696
01:24:38,925 --> 01:24:42,005
Are you kidding, Tony? You know cops can't read.

697
01:24:42,425 --> 01:24:44,875
What does "incompetent" mean?

698
01:24:46,335 --> 01:24:50,335
That mayor, he calls me at 2 o'clock in the morning!

699
01:24:50,755 --> 01:24:53,005
I mean, I don't even answer the phone anymore.

700
01:24:53,425 --> 01:24:56,175
What does "baffled" mean?

701
01:25:27,795 --> 01:25:30,795
Karen Joan Nash.

702
01:25:32,795 --> 01:25:34,675
Yeah, I remember this one.

703
01:25:35,085 --> 01:25:38,735
I was practicing in Syracuse. Didn't get many of these.

704
01:25:38,885 --> 01:25:39,925
What?

705
01:25:40,335 --> 01:25:44,375
Unwed mothers. Nowadays, that's no big deal.

706
01:25:45,675 --> 01:25:49,625
Back then in Syracuse, that was a stoning offense.

707
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:52,045
What happened?

708
01:25:53,335 --> 01:25:56,755
- She had the baby and she died.
- So, Nash was illegitimate?

709
01:25:57,175 --> 01:26:00,335
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he was illegitimate.

710
01:26:00,755 --> 01:26:04,295
For about a minute and a half. He died right after she did.

711
01:26:08,755 --> 01:26:10,085
He died?

712
01:26:21,135 --> 01:26:22,545
Hello, Brenda.

713
01:26:23,175 --> 01:26:24,475
I did what you asked.

714
01:26:24,515 --> 01:26:27,745
I spent all night going through the old deeds
to Nash's house in Hudson Street,

715
01:26:27,795 --> 01:26:32,875
all the way back back through the five previous
owners to the original guy, Montague in 1796.

716
01:26:33,295 --> 01:26:36,465
In all five instances, Montague through Nash,

717
01:26:36,885 --> 01:26:40,505
I found a death certificate for a kid
with the same name who died at birth,

718
01:26:40,925 --> 01:26:44,585
years before he pretended to sign for his inheritance.

719
01:26:45,635 --> 01:26:47,505
Jesus, Rick. Isn't there any heat in here?

720
01:26:47,925 --> 01:26:49,925
No, heat is bad for the circuits.

721
01:26:50,335 --> 01:26:53,215
Now, just in case there's any doubt...

722
01:27:15,295 --> 01:27:16,985
So what you've got here, Brenda,

723
01:27:17,035 --> 01:27:20,125
is a guy who's been creeping around since at least 1700,

724
01:27:20,545 --> 01:27:22,715
pretending to croak every once in a while,

725
01:27:23,135 --> 01:27:26,925
leaving all these goods to kids
who've been corpses for years

726
01:27:27,295 --> 01:27:29,465
and assuming their identities.

727
01:27:35,045 --> 01:27:37,045
It's not possible.

728
01:27:39,295 --> 01:27:43,175
"Post" final! Cops release Headhunter picture!

729
01:27:43,585 --> 01:27:45,135
- Reward offered!
- I'll take a "Post".

730
01:27:45,185 --> 01:27:47,005
- Me too.
- Headhunter revealed!

731
01:28:20,755 --> 01:28:23,005
For you, my bonny Heather.

732
01:28:24,255 --> 01:28:26,125
Happy birthday.

733
01:28:28,175 --> 01:28:30,295
And you, Juan Ramírez.

734
01:28:32,335 --> 01:28:34,875
Take care of her, you overdressed haggis.

735
01:29:12,175 --> 01:29:14,375
Kastagir is gone.

736
01:29:14,795 --> 01:29:17,125
Only you and I remain.

737
01:29:24,755 --> 01:29:27,665
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

738
01:29:28,175 --> 01:29:29,715
Who cuts your hair?

739
01:29:30,135 --> 01:29:32,835
I am in disguise.

740
01:29:34,255 --> 01:29:36,925
This way no one will recognize me.

741
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:40,675
I do.

742
01:29:42,795 --> 01:29:45,215
- What do you want?
- Your head.

743
01:29:46,925 --> 01:29:48,545
And the prize.

744
01:29:50,835 --> 01:29:52,175
Watch.

745
01:29:52,885 --> 01:29:55,175
Happy Halloween, ladies!

746
01:30:04,675 --> 01:30:07,545
Nuns! No sense of humor.

747
01:30:08,585 --> 01:30:13,045
Ramírez's blade did not cut deeply enough.

748
01:30:13,465 --> 01:30:15,635
He was right about you. You're slime.

749
01:30:15,755 --> 01:30:18,255
Ramírez was an effete snob!

750
01:30:18,675 --> 01:30:20,795
He died on his knees.

751
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:26,755
I took his head and raped his woman
before his blood was even cold.

752
01:30:35,755 --> 01:30:37,965
I see!

753
01:30:38,795 --> 01:30:40,675
Ramírez lied.

754
01:30:43,585 --> 01:30:45,755
She was not his woman.

755
01:30:46,795 --> 01:30:48,625
She was your woman.

756
01:30:49,335 --> 01:30:51,675
And she never told you.

757
01:30:52,795 --> 01:30:55,085
I wonder why.

758
01:30:55,505 --> 01:30:59,925
Perhaps I gave her something you never could...

759
01:31:02,045 --> 01:31:06,375
and secretly she yearned for my return.

760
01:31:06,795 --> 01:31:08,795
Holy ground, Highlander!

761
01:31:09,215 --> 01:31:12,255
Remember what Ramírez taught you.

762
01:31:16,965 --> 01:31:19,545
You can't stay in here forever.

763
01:31:22,465 --> 01:31:24,465
You are weak, Highlander.

764
01:31:24,965 --> 01:31:30,375
You will always be weaker than I.

765
01:31:34,505 --> 01:31:36,215
I'll be out front.

766
01:31:40,795 --> 01:31:42,335
Goodbye, MacLeod.

767
01:31:42,755 --> 01:31:45,295
We will meet soon enough.

768
01:31:57,505 --> 01:31:59,585
This is the house of God.

769
01:32:00,005 --> 01:32:02,715
People are trying to pray. You're disturbing them.

770
01:32:04,385 --> 01:32:07,925
He cares about these helpless mortals?

771
01:32:09,135 --> 01:32:11,045
Of course he cares.

772
01:32:11,465 --> 01:32:13,465
He died for our sins.

773
01:32:13,885 --> 01:32:15,835
That shall be his undoing.

774
01:32:18,085 --> 01:32:19,085
Father,

775
01:32:20,295 --> 01:32:22,005
forgive me.

776
01:32:22,425 --> 01:32:24,925
I am a worm.

777
01:32:38,335 --> 01:32:40,715
I have something to say.

778
01:32:41,135 --> 01:32:44,545
It's better to burn out than to fade away.

779
01:32:53,885 --> 01:32:55,635
I need to see him, goddamn it!

780
01:32:55,715 --> 01:32:58,715
I'm afraid that's impossible. Mr. Nash is...

781
01:32:59,635 --> 01:33:02,255
Mr. Nash is dead, Miss Ellenstein!

782
01:33:04,835 --> 01:33:08,375
- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a dead guy named Nash.

783
01:33:08,795 --> 01:33:10,835
He died at birth in Syracuse, New York.

784
01:33:17,135 --> 01:33:18,295
All right.

785
01:33:19,465 --> 01:33:20,835
Come on.

786
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:49,375
Are the claymores real?

787
01:33:50,965 --> 01:33:55,215
What is this, a museum? This stuff must be worth a fortune.

788
01:34:04,085 --> 01:34:07,255
I have been alive for four and a half centuries.

789
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,175
I cannot die.

790
01:34:11,925 --> 01:34:14,335
Well, everybody's got their problems.

791
01:34:21,045 --> 01:34:22,505
What are you goning to do with that?

792
01:34:22,925 --> 01:34:24,465
Take it.

793
01:34:39,255 --> 01:34:42,175
I am Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod.

794
01:34:42,925 --> 01:34:47,715
I was born in 1518 in the village of
Glennfinnan on the shores of Loch Shiel.

795
01:34:49,965 --> 01:34:51,675
And I am immortal.

796
01:36:30,735 --> 01:36:32,135
You're not listening.

797
01:36:32,635 --> 01:36:36,295
Brenda, it isn't going to work.
I can't get involved, not again.

798
01:36:49,635 --> 01:36:51,875
You know what's weird?

799
01:36:52,295 --> 01:36:54,545
Most people are afraid to die.

800
01:36:54,965 --> 01:36:57,125
That's not your problem.

801
01:36:57,545 --> 01:36:59,835
You're afraid to live.

802
01:37:04,505 --> 01:37:06,425
Take care of yourself.

803
01:37:06,835 --> 01:37:08,755
Don't lose your head.

804
01:37:24,425 --> 01:37:26,295
Hello, pretty.

805
01:37:31,215 --> 01:37:32,125
Come on, open up!

806
01:37:41,255 --> 01:37:42,715
Mamma mia.

807
01:38:04,755 --> 01:38:06,255
You ever played chicken?

808
01:38:10,935 --> 01:38:12,935
Here we go!

809
01:38:15,335 --> 01:38:16,635
Watch out!

I want you to follow them.

You'll have everything you need.

You're not coming back!

Goodbye, Russell Nash.
