00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,950
...Jim Brunzell and Tonga Kid!
Your opponents,

2
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,660

3
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,950
with a combined weight of 725 lbs:

4
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:46,410
"The Toast from the Coast" from
backstreet USA, Atlanta, Georgia,

5
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:49,950
the "Fabulous Freebirds!"

6
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,250
Yeah, right! You're gonna love it!

7
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,250
Kill him! Stamp out the sonofa...

8
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,750
Don't give them a chance!

9
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,620
Hey, where are you going?

10
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,700
MacLeod!

11
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,910
Fasil...

12
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,290
Wait.

13
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,700
All right...

14
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,950
MacLeod!

15
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,130
The clan of Macleod!

16
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:52,200
May this year of our Lord 1536...

17
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:55,540
bring victory to the clan MacLeod!

18
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,370
MacLeod! Victory to MacLeod!

19
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:15,500
Are you scared, Connor?

20
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,800
Ha ha ha!

21
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,390
No, cousin Dugal, I'm not.

22
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,330
Don't talk nonsense, man!

23
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,790
I peed my kilt the first time I went into battle!

24
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,040
Aye, Angus pees his kilt all the time.

25
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,370
Connor!

26
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,660
Connor!

27
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,540
Connor, wait!

28
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,450
Wait!

29
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,950
Take these flowers and think of me.

30
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,400
Remember, you fight with God on your side, Connor.

31
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:10,370
Aye, a girl like that can wound a soldier more than a Fraser's sword, my friend.

32
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,040
Angus! You and Dugal keep him in one piece! Do ya hear?

33
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:16,200
Ay We all know which piece that is!

34
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:04,290
- There is one called Connor among them.
- Aye.

35
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,410
Remember our agreement, Murdoch:

36
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:16,080
The boy is mine.

37
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,830
It's begun.

38
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:21,370
Death to the MacLeods!

39
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,920
Death to the Frazers!

40
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Yay! Yah!

41
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,290
MacLeod!

42
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:15,330
Come on!

43
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,200
Macleod!

44
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,250
Damn you, stay under!

45
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
Forgive me.

46
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,330
My son.

47
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,450
Fight me, damn you!

48
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,320
- No, that's Connor MacLeod!
- Fight me, you cowards!

49
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,520
No, not him!

50
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,790
Castrate the heathens!

51
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,040
Nobody will fight me!

52
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,620
They all run away.

53
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,120
Great, laddie, stay by me.

54
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:01,290
Mother of God!

55
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:07,790
Fight me!

56
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,660
Dugal! No!

57
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:25,370
Come on, quick!

58
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,660
There can be only one!

59
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,790
Another time, MacLeod!

60
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,750
Get out of the car! Put your hands on the hood!

61
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,910
Move!

62
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,940
Okay!

63
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,580
- Watch it, freak! Just cool it!
- Watch it!

64
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,880
Watch him! Watch him!

65
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,220
Move! Come on! Come on! Come on! Move!

66
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,750
Come on, come on!

67
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,270
Get up there!

68
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,250
- Spread 'em! Spread 'em!
- Come on!

69
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,910
Let's see some I.D., pal.

70
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:40,790
Well, Mr. Nash, where were you going...

71
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,790
in such a hurry?

72
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,790
Gimee me it! Gimee me it! Gimee me it!

73
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,010
Ooh!

74
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,410
Don't move, pal!

75
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,080
Don't even breathe.

76
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:42,920
In nomine patri et filii et spiritu sancti.

77
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,950
Amen.

78
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:50,040
- It is over.
- No!

79
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:54,790
Other men are dying this day. I must attend them.

80
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,410
Quiet!

81
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,870
He's a Highlander, by God!

82
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:10,200
The last thing ta hear should not be that of a wailing woman!

83
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,160
Hey, come on, let me through.

84
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,290
Damn it Frank, forensics are supposed to be notified the same time...

85
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,950
as homicide!

86
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,410
Holy shit!

87
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,870
- Yeah, this one came unassembled.
- Did you made an arrest?

88
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,410
Nah. We're questioning some guy named Nash, antiques dealer down on Hudson Street.

89
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:55,910
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, Walt.

90
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,410
You look pretty, Brenda.

91
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:01,790
What do you think is the cause of death, Lieutenant, huh?

92
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,270
Christ, you're a barrel of laughs, Garfield.

93
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:10,250
- Get your hands off!
- Hey, cop! What'd gonna explain this to my wife, man!

94
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,250
Walker, get me a cherry cheese danish too, please!

95
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,040
- What did they say? What time did he buy it?
- Oh, about ten, ten-thirty.

96
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,720
Whatever made the cut was razor sharp.

97
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,640
Get out! I told you! Would you get out of here with these cameras!

98
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Frank! Frank! About two days ago on the teletype...

99
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,200
Oh my God!

100
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:33,700
...a guy was killed just like this over in New Jersey.
- Yeah, but I figure what the hell, that's Jersey

101
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,500
Hey Coppers! I'm late and I wanna get out of here!

102
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:39,080
Hey Frank, come here!

103
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:42,450
Oh shit!

104
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,080
Ooh, baby, look at you

105
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,450
Garfield, cover that head.

106
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,680
Ooh...

107
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,910
- What the hell have you got?
- A Toledo Salamanca.

108
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,540
- A what?
- A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

109
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,830
- Well is it worth much?
- Only about a million bucks.

110
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,850
[Whistles]

111
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,540
Any antique dealer on Hudson Street could tell you that.

112
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,500
You can't keep me here asshole!

113
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,580
I know my rights!

114
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:54,660
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

115
00:21:55,750 --> 00:22:01,690
The name's Vasilek. Polish national.
Had his head chopped off in New Jersey two nights ago.

116
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,700
- You ever get over to New Jersey, Nash?
- Not if I can help it.

117
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,080
- You talk funny, Nash. Where you from?
- Lots of different places.

118
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,200
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,830
Okay What's that?

120
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,040
- A sword?
- Wise up, smart ass!

121
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,160
- That's a Toledo Salamanca broadsword worth about a million bucks.
- So?

122
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,580
- So, you want to hear a theory?
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,600
You went down that garage to buy this sword from that guy...

124
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,450
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

125
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:43,500
Okay, his name is Iman Fasil. You fought about the price and cut off his head.

126
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,290
Huh...

127
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,500
You want to hear another theory?

128
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,790
This Fasil was so upset about the lousy wrestling tonight,

129
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:56,080
that he went down to the garage and in a fit of depression he cut off his own head.

130
00:22:57,370 --> 00:22:59,200
That's not funny, Walt.

131
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:04,160
- Are you a faggot, Nash?
- Why Garfield? Are you cruisin' for a piece of ass?

132
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:08,450
I'll tell you what happened, Russell.

133
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,200
You went down to the garage for a blow job.
You just didn't want to pay for it.

134
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,160
Huh. You are sick.

135
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:18,900
Hey! Hey!

136
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,670
Hey, what are you doing?

137
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,660
Stop!

138
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:25,160
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

139
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:28,960
That's enough! That is enough! Now, cut it out!

140
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:31,000
Goddamn it, I said cut it out!

141
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,250
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

142
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,500
- Then we're through.
- Nash, we're just getting started!

143
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,790
...garage and water from a sprinkler.

144
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,900
It also left a man's decapitated body

145
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,810
lying on the floor next to his own severed head.

146
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:56,970
- A head, which this time has no name.
- I know his name

Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger, room 315,

155
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,080
and I'm going to hit you for twenty in advance.

156
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,700
Uh, hey, uh.

157
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:51,750
If there's anything you need broads or blow just dial O, huh?

158
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:57,080
That's right, Mr. Kruger. Lucky Strike means fine tobac.

159
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,000
- Don't talk to the guests!
- I didn't do nothin' boss!

160
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,830
At last!

161
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:56,910
The Gathering!

162
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,330
Hi!

163
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:03,790
I'm Candy.

00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,620
Of course you are.

165
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,120
Come on in.

166
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,260
- Hiya.
- Hi.

167
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,320
- Got a present for you from the coroner.
- Yeah? What's that?

168
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,950
Pieces of metal. Found 'em on the dead guy under the Garden.

169
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,790
In the wound and on the clothes.

170
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,580
Real smooth shave.

171
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,870
That can't be right.

172
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,950
Son of a bitch

173
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,120
Who's there?

174
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,410
- Hey, Brenda. The usual?
- Lots of it.

175
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,910

A double Glenmorangie on the rocks
- Glenmorangie. Right.

183
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,790

184

Oh!

210
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,250
Nice to see you again, Macleod.

211
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,330
Nice to see...

212
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:47,350
Ooh!

213
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,140
Ooh!

214
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,040
- Stop!

215
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,200
No!

216
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:03,620
You, on the ground. This is the police!

217
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,160
Put down your weapons. Put your hands on your heads.

218
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:11,000
Another time, Highlander. I will find you.

219
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,110
Hey, hold it right there! Come back here!

220
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,450
Stop, wait a minute!

221
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:26,540
Who in the name of God was that? He called you Highlander.
What does it mean, "there can only be one?" There can only be one what?

222
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:30,830
- Listen, lady, you almost...
- I want to know - Shut up!

223
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,790
Don't you ever follow me again.

224
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,410
You only have one life. If you value it,

225
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,580
go home.

226
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,500
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

227
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:54,540
You saw the wound, Angus.

228
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,540
- He should have died.
- I say he's got the devil in him!

229
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,000
Drinking with us, are you?

230
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:26,040
- What's the matter, Dugal?
- You talking and breathing.

231
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,160
Last night all but a corpse.

232
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:32,200
- How did you manage that, Connor Macleod?
- Would you rather I was dead?

233
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,040
It's not natural.

234
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,580
He's in league with Lucifer.

235
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,330
Don't say that, Kate!

236
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:46,870
I'll say it! You've the devil in you.

237
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
We've been kinsmen 20 years!

238
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:55,870
Connor MacLeod was my kinsman. I don't know who you are.

239
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:04,750
Angus - You'd better go, Connor.

240
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:09,620
I'm not going anywhere.

241
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,970
He's the devil! Kill him!

242
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,090
Lucifer!

243
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,700
Burn the devil out of him!

244
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
All right. Get him down.

245
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,990
Burn him!

246
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,910
Dugal!

247
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,440
Leave him be!

248
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,700
Dugal...

249
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,200
- Dugal, kill him!
- Oh!

250
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,700
He's your cousin, man!

251
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,830
No, Angus!

252
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:56,910
Quiet! Quiet!

253
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,750
There'll be no burning here today.

254
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,950
We'll banish him.

255
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:05,950
No! Burn him!

256
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:07,480
Stop it, Kate!

257
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:11,320
Burn him! Angus, burn him!

258
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:15,000
- Can you walk?
- I'll bloody well walk out of here.

259
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:17,700
Then go, while you still can!

260
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:21,870
I'll not forget you, Angus.

261
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,370
That's a good girl.

262
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,660
- Pie and ale, do you want it?
- Aye.

263
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,450
Right now!

264
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:50,000
You filthy sod! You're all muck and muscle.

265
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:53,870
Aye, Blossom. The way you like it.

266
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:00,390
Waah!

267
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,200
You can do that to me forever if you like, my Lord.

268
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:25,700
- Will you, Connor?
- Aye, Blossom. I will.

269
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,500
Hello!

270
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,910
Greetings.

271
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,040
I am Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez,

272
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,830
chief metallurgist to King Charles V of Spain,

273
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,250
and I'm at your service.

274
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,160
Who?

275
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,870
- What do you want?
- You.

276
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,910
You're Connor MacLeod.
- Maybe I am and...

277
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,330
You're Connor MacLeod,

278
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:12,290
wounded in battle and driven from your village of Glenfinnan

279
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:14,200
five years ago.

280
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:15,870
Connor!

281
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,910
- Heather, go in the house.
- I'll stay right here.

282
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,290
Do as I say, woman!

283
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,450
The sensation you're feeling

284
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,330
is the Quickening.

285
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:48,200
- Who are you?
- We are the same, MacLeod.

286
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,700
We are brothers!

287
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,410
I knew you guys were bottle-fed

288
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:06,660
Yeah, there's not a helluva lot I can do about it, pal.

289
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,790
You see what I'm up against!

290
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,660
His Vietnamese neighbor ate his dog.

291
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:18,660
- Uh... that's confidential. How are things over at forensics?
- Dull.

292
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:22,620
- How about some lunch?
- Lunch? It's a good idea. Who pays?

293
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
- Me.
- You're on.

294
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:29,450
By the way, Frank The hairs in the Moretti case matched up.

295
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:33,040
- What did I tell you.
- Oh, I forgot my purse.

296
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,120
I'll meet you outside.

297
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,870
Garfield, Brenda and I are going to lunch.

298
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,870

Oh, you complain endlessly.

302
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:52,370

- Haggis? What is haggis?

303
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:55,000
A sheep's stomach stuffed with meat and barley.

304
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,410
- And what do you do with it?
- You eat it!

305
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,620
How revolting!

306

Ah-choo!

307
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:06,870
- Be still for God's sake! You'll tip us over.
- So?

308
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:10,870
- I cannot swim, you Spanish peacock!
- I'm not Spanish. I'm Egyptian.

309
00:42:11,290 --> 00:42:14,000
You said you were from Spain. You're a liar!

310
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:19,580
You have the manners of a goat, and you smell like a dungheap,

311
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:24,330

312
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,200
Get out!

00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,540
Help! Help!

314
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,560

316
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,540

317
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:41,580
You're immortal.

328
00:43:57,330 --> 00:43:59,330
Hey!

329
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:07,160
This cannot be.

330
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,500
It's the devil's work.

331
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,620
You cannot die, MacLeod. Accept it.

332
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,540
Heh ha ha!

333
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:20,570
Ha ha ha ha!

334
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,660
- I hate you!
- Good.

335
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,290
That is a perfect way to start.

336
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:31,370
Tell me, how did it happen for God's sake?

337
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,330
Why does the sun come up?

338
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:43,410
Or are the stars just pinholes in the curtain of night? Who knows?

339
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:48,370
What I do know is that, because you were born different

340
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:52,160
men will fear you, try to drive you away

341
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:54,450
like the people of your village.

342
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:08,870
You must learn to conceal your special gift

343
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:11,410
and harness your power

344
00:45:11,830 --> 00:45:14,410
until the time of the Gathering.

345
00:45:17,370 --> 00:45:18,910
What Gathering?

346
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,290
When only a few of us are left,

347
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:26,790
we will feel an irresistible pull towards a faraway land

348
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,750
to fight for the prize.

349
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:33,700
Come on!

350
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,200
Faster!

351
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:45,700
Unh!

352
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,830
Never lose your temper.

353
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:52,830
If your head comes away from your neck, it's over.

354
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,750
Never overextend your thrust.

355
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:25,160
You're vulnerable and off balance.

356
00:46:25,620 --> 00:46:27,250
Connor

357
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,790
Heather, please!

358
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:48,120
If it came down to just us two, would you take my head?

359
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:57,160
We must fight till only one remains.

360
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:02,000
You're safe only on holy ground. None of us will violate that law.

361
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:04,120
It's tradition.

362
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:19,330
And now for the last.

363
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:21,910
Trust me.

364
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,580
Let yourself feel the stag,

365
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,160
his heart beating,

366
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,040
his blood

367
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:44,500
coursing.

368
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:46,540
Feel?

369
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,160
- Come on!
- I feel him

370
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,790
MacLeod, come on!

371
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:58,160
- I feel him!
- Come on!

372
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:03,450
I feel him!

373
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:10,000
Come on, Haggis!

374
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,870
MacLeod, this is the Quickening!

375
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:59,660
Now, pendejo... shall we see what sort of swordsman you've become?

376
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:01,500
En garde!

377
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,000
Very good.

378
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:32,120
Give me your hand, brother.

379
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:52,040
That one there. How much is it?

380
00:50:09,830 --> 00:50:11,120
Put him in.

381
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,370
But what I want is a family.

382
00:50:13,790 --> 00:50:17,580
You cannot have a family. We cannot have children.

383
00:50:19,910 --> 00:50:23,290
That won't please Heather. I'll tell you that for nothing.

384
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:27,450
He's full of life.

385
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:30,540
Connor!

386
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,450
Here's dinner.

387
00:50:37,450 --> 00:50:40,660
I'll be off now. I fancy buying me a new dress.

388
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:47,330
Oh, you little devils go on!

389
00:50:49,830 --> 00:50:51,580
She is beautiful.

390
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,660
You must leave her, brother.

391
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,410
MacLeod,

392
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:12,750
I was born 2,437 years ago.

393
00:51:13,790 --> 00:51:16,120
In that time I've had 3 wives.

394
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:19,450
The last was Shakiko, a Japanese princess.

395
00:51:19,870 --> 00:51:24,500
Her father, Masamune, a genius, made this for me.

396
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,870
In 593 B.C.

397
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:31,330
It is the only one of its kind...

398
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,040
like his daughter.

399
00:51:36,540 --> 00:51:39,120
When Shakiko died, I was shattered.

400
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:41,700
I would save you that pain.

401
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,830
Please, let Heather go.

402
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:08,250
When we first met you felt ill. Remember?

403
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:13,830
- That wasn't the first time you felt that sensation, was it?
- No.

404
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,120
When the MacLeods fought the Frasers and a black knight.

405
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:23,450
I felt it then. Only it was different. More painful.

406
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:29,040
That black knight was a Kurgan. It's because of him I sought you out.

407
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:34,330
Who is the Kurgan? Where does he come from?

408
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:38,160
The Kurgans were an ancient people from the steppes of Russia.

409
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:43,950
For amusement they tossed children into pits with hungry dogs to fight for meat.

410
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:48,500
The Kurgan. He is the strongest of all the immortals.

411
00:52:48,910 --> 00:52:51,620
He is the perfect warrior.

412
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:57,160
If he wins the prize, mortal man would suffer an eternity of darkness.

413
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,750
How do you fight such a savage?

414
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,700
With heart, faith and steel.

415
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,040
In the end there can be only one.

416
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:19,200
- It must have been very dangerous for you.
- Well, I was very much in love with her, my dear Heather.

417
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:22,830
She was the only thing on my mind. Not danger.

418
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:27,120
So holding the rose in my teeth, I climbed up on the rooftop,

419
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:31,750
lowered a rope and swung in through the open window.

420
00:53:34,290 --> 00:53:38,790
- Unfortunately, the lady was was no longer there.
- What did you do?

421
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,410
Well, I introduced myself to the lady who was there.

422
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:45,080
She was most helpful.

423
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:49,330
Oh. Would you like some more wine?

424
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,160
Yes, please.

425
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:06,620
- Heather, get out.
- What's wrong?

426
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,450
Get out!

427
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,140
[screams]

428
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,410
Kurgan!

429
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:21,620
Ramirez

430
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:25,220
Raaaaaaaah!

431
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:32,370
The Highlander

432
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,620
Where is he?

433
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:39,580
- You're too late. I've prepared him for you.
- You waste your time!

434
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:56,020
[screams]

435
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:07,620
It hurts?

436
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,350
[screams]

437
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,410
Now you die!

438
00:55:28,910 --> 00:55:31,750
You cannot win, Ramirez. I'm the strongest!

439
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,080
My cut has improved your voice.

440
00:57:16,290 --> 00:57:17,500
Yes!

441
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:51,660
Ahh. Hurts?

442
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,620
Who is the woman?

443
00:58:00,290 --> 00:58:01,830
Oh! She's mine!

444
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:05,120
Not for much longer.

445
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,580
Tonight you sleep in hell.

446
00:58:18,370 --> 00:58:20,330
There can be only one!

447
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,750
Hello, pretty!

448
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,200
- I'd like to speak to Russell Nash.
- Well I'm sorry, Mr. Nash isn't here at the moment.

449
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:30,250
- May I call him at home? I have to talk to him today.
- Ah, I'm afraid that won't be possible.

450
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:35,330
- Good Morning.
- This is Brenda Wyatt, Mr. Nash.

451
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:40,410
We've already met, Rachel. What can I do for you?

452
00:59:40,830 --> 00:59:42,330
I'd like some advice.

453
00:59:42,830 --> 00:59:47,150
Are you the kind of woman that takes advice?
- That depends.

454
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,010
- Advice about what?

455
00:59:49,030 --> 00:59:52,250
What can you tell me about a seven-foot lunatic hacking away with a broadsword

456
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:54,810
at one o'clock in the morning, New York City, 1985?

457
00:59:58,370 --> 00:59:59,250
Not much.

458
00:59:59,660 --> 01:00:05,080
What about a Japanese sword dated 600 B.C.?
The metal in the blade folded 200 times.

459
01:00:05,830 --> 01:00:07,910
I don't deal in exotic weapons.

460
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:11,620
Can I show you something in 18th century silver?

461
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,370
That's not why I came here and you know it.

462
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:20,210
- Do you cook?
- Why?

463
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:22,240
- I thought we might have dinner.

464
01:00:22,450 --> 01:00:23,660
- Did you?
- Yes.

465
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:32,620
So, I'm standing there and there's Brenda. Our little Brenda.

466
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,910
You sure it was Brenda?

467
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:38,870
She was in Nash's shop. She was talkin' to him.

468
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:52,040
- What are you looking at, Rachel?
- The eyes in the back of your head.

469
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:58,620
People are asking about you. What am I supposed to say?

470
01:00:59,540 --> 01:01:01,040
Hmm?

471
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:03,500
Tell them I'm immortal.

472
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:06,700
[in German] Attention! Four men over here!

473
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:38,760
Shh.

474
01:01:39,290 --> 01:01:41,080
Quiet

475
01:01:46,910 --> 01:01:48,290
Don't be afraid.

476
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,910
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

477
01:01:51,330 --> 01:01:54,620
- What happened?
- Everybody is dead.

478
01:01:55,940 --> 01:01:57,440
Shh.

479
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,250
I'm like you. I'm alone.

480
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,620
Come with me, Rachel.

481
01:02:17,080 --> 01:02:22,830
- You're alive! Why didn't you die?
- Hey. It's a kind of magic. Shh.

482
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,250
- [in German] You should be dead!
- Move!

483
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:32,410
[in German] No! You'll have to shoot me first.

484
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:37,000
Whatever you say, Jack. You're the master race.

485
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:42,580
Let's go.

486
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:46,410
That was a long time ago.

487
01:02:47,330 --> 01:02:50,160
Would you listen to me for one moment, please.

488
01:02:51,370 --> 01:02:55,250
You can't hide your feelings from me. I've known you too long.

489
01:02:55,660 --> 01:02:58,950
- What feelings?
- How about loneliness?

490
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:01,620
I'm not lonely.

491
01:03:02,250 --> 01:03:06,200
- I've got everything I need right here.
- Oh no, you don't.

492
01:03:08,080 --> 01:03:11,120
You refuse to let anyone love you.

493
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,790
Love is for poets.

494
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:21,040
You're such a romantic, Rachel.

495
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,080
You always were.

496
01:03:46,540 --> 01:03:48,160
Just a minute!

497
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,540
Good evening.

498
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:17,080
Do you want to dine in the hall, or shall we step inside?

499
01:04:17,910 --> 01:04:19,510
Ohh.

500
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,330
Come in.

501
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:24,570
- May I take your coat?
- No thanks.

502
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:25,790
- What?

503
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:28,660
- I'll hold on to it.
- Oh, fine.

504
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,750
- Where are you going?
- I forgot my earrings.

505
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:39,700
Make yourself a drink. There are glasses in the bar.

506
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,830
Do you know what you're doing?

507
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,290
I like your place, Brenda.

508
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:21,540
I've only been here 3 months. I'm still fixing it up.

509
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,160
- Interesting view.
- What did you say?

510
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,290
I said, "Interesting view."

511
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:39,040
Isn't it great?

512
01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:49,790
You never told me what you do for a living.

513
01:05:50,540 --> 01:05:54,120
I work for the Metropolitan Museum

514
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:57,410
in Acquisitions.

515
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:03,040
That explains your interest in ancient weapons.

516
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,120
Right

517
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,160
Especially the Samurai.

518
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:12,790
Very nice.

519
01:06:13,700 --> 01:06:16,660
- Shall we have a toast?
- Yes.

520
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,200
Brandy

521
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,620
Bottled in 1783.

522
01:06:27,040 --> 01:06:28,750
Wow, that's old

523
01:06:31,660 --> 01:06:34,200
1783 was a very good year.

524
01:06:36,540 --> 01:06:39,120
Mozart wrote his great mass.

525
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,500
The Montgolfier Brothers

526
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,750
went up in their first balloon.

527
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:53,250
And England recognized the independence of the United States.

528
01:06:53,660 --> 01:06:55,040
Is that right?

529
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,000
Yes.

530
01:07:04,660 --> 01:07:06,290
What's that?

531
01:07:07,450 --> 01:07:10,200
It's for you.
- Can I open it?

532
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,720
- If you like

533
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,500
You bastard! Where did you find this?

534
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:31,540
I have an extensive library.

535
01:07:33,040 --> 01:07:36,450
Odd thing, your bio doesn't mention the Met.

536
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:40,750
It says you work for the police. In forensics.

537
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,950
- Are you and Moran trying to set me up?
- I don't work for Moran.

538
01:07:45,370 --> 01:07:49,870
Then why is that bald policeman sitting outside watching your apartment?

539
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,790
You remember him. Moran's had him tailing me.

540
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,830
What're you gonna do?

541
01:07:56,790 --> 01:08:01,910
The question is what're you gonna do? You gonna turn
off the tape or are you gonna shoot me with the .45?

542
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,620
I'm not looking for a killer. I'm looking for a sword. The one used on Fasil.

543
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:13,580
- I found pieces of it under the Garden. I only want to see the Samurai.
- Why?

544
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:18,410
I told you. Because it's not supposed to exist!
I dated pieces of the blade at 600 B.C.

545
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:23,290
The metal had been folded 200 times. Now the Japanese
didn't start making swords like that 'til the Middle Ages.

546
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:26,000
So, where the hell did it come from?

547
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:29,450
If I could verify the existence of such a weapon, it would be like...

548
01:08:29,870 --> 01:08:33,910
discovering a 747 a thousand years before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

549
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,330
This is crazy.

550
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:40,200
Wait a minute, Nash! I want some answers.

551
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,830
You want ...?

552
01:08:43,830 --> 01:08:46,830
Don't you ever think about anything except what you want?

553
01:09:01,830 --> 01:09:04,160
You must leave her, brother.

554
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:25,160
Heather!

555
01:10:42,670 --> 01:10:43,670
Heather!

556
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,370
Connor, I'm here!

557
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,700
My beautiful man.

558
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:14,870
My husband.

559
01:11:15,290 --> 01:11:17,410
I am that, my love.

560
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:23,910
I've never really known

561
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,200
What?

562
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,910
Why you stayed.

563
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,790
Because I love you as much now as the first day we met.

564
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,580
And I love you.

565
01:11:45,330 --> 01:11:47,040
I don't want to die.

566
01:11:48,200 --> 01:11:50,120
I want to stay with you.

567
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:51,950
Forever.

568
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,040
I want that, too.

569
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:58,120
Will you do something for me, Connor?

570
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,290
What, Blossom?

571
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:08,950
In the years to come, will you light a candle and remember me on my birthday?

572
01:12:10,290 --> 01:12:11,750
Aye, love.

573
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:13,660
I will.

574
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:17,040
I wanted to have your children.

575
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:21,540
They would have been strong and fine.

576
01:12:26,080 --> 01:12:28,620
Don't see me, Connor.

577
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,290
Let me die in peace.

578
01:12:33,910 --> 01:12:35,370
Where are we?

579
01:12:42,700 --> 01:12:44,750
We're in the Highlands.

580
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:48,870
Where else?

581
01:12:52,580 --> 01:12:55,080
Running down a mountain side.

582
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:10,790
The sun is shining.

583
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,160
It's not cold.

584
01:13:16,160 --> 01:13:18,750
You've got your sheepskins on

585
01:13:22,580 --> 01:13:25,700
and the boots I made for you.

586
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:31,040
Goodnight, my bonny Heather.

587
01:13:46,370 --> 01:13:48,330
Hey, Kastagir.

588
01:13:50,830 --> 01:13:54,080
MacLeod. It's good to see you again.

589
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:56,660
It seems like 100 years.

590
01:13:57,080 --> 01:13:58,750
It's been 100 years.

591
01:14:07,120 --> 01:14:08,700
How've you been?

592
01:14:10,540 --> 01:14:13,330
Hey. This...

593
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,120
puts hairs on your chest.

594
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:21,620
- What is it?
- Boom-boom!

595
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:26,000
A big strong man like you shouldn't be afraid of a little boom-boom!

596
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:30,870
- Maybe you think I want to poison you?
- I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

597
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:35,830
So, the Gathering is here.

598
01:14:38,870 --> 01:14:43,660
- Time has almost caught us, my friend.
- Has it? Do you think we should go on?

599
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,080
I think we should have a party.

600
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:53,750
- Oh no! I remember the last time we had a party.
- Really, when exactly was that?

601
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:55,870
It was 1783.

602
01:14:56,290 --> 01:14:58,410
1783

603
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:03,000
Oh yes, your famous duel on Boston Common.

604
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:08,040
- You were drunk. What was that guy's name again?
- His name was Bassett.

605
01:15:08,450 --> 01:15:13,000
- The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett! I implore you.
- I am fighting this duel, Hotchkiss, not you.

606
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:16,790
See if the imbecile is ready.

607
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:21,290
- Mr. Bassett is waiting, Sir.
- Tell him I'm ready.

608
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,750
Christ! I've gone blind!

609
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:26,200
En garde, Sir!

610
01:15:30,580 --> 01:15:34,000
- Wonderful, Sir.
- Yes. Thank you, Hotchkiss.

611
01:15:34,910 --> 01:15:38,040
Bassett, is that you?

612
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:40,550
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

613
01:15:47,870 --> 01:15:49,870
The sword, the sword.

614
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:02,500
Stop, Sir!

615
01:16:02,910 --> 01:16:04,410
I beseech you.

616
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:06,450
I apologize for calling

617
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:10,160
your wife a bloated Warthog,

618
01:16:10,580 --> 01:16:12,870
and I bid you good day.

619
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:19,290
Shoot him, Sir? Shoot him. Now, Sir, in the back of the head. Now, sir!

620
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,700
Hotchkiss Hotchkiss, stop it!

621
01:16:24,410 --> 01:16:26,830
- Hotchkiss ...?
- Sir?

622
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,790
No, Sir

623
01:16:28,810 --> 01:16:30,810
No, no, no, no...

624
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:39,250
That's the mood of New York at this moment,

625
01:16:39,660 --> 01:16:43,080
- ...an angry city in the grip of fear. So far...
- Get out of here! Get out of here!

626
01:16:50,490 --> 01:16:52,490
Earlier today, in response to growing pressure...

627
01:16:52,510 --> 01:16:55,010
the mayor's office issued the following statement...

628
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,080
- Give us a drink, pal.
- Got a joint?

629
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:00,700
...vigorous investigation...

630
01:17:00,720 --> 01:17:02,720
following up on some promising leads.

631
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:04,330
Hey, Rockefeller.

632
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:09,080
How'd you liked Candy? She said you were kind of kinky, huh?

633
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:13,250
Don't ever speak to me.

634
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,620
Look, I didn't mean

635
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:27,250
Don't ever speak to me again!

636
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:29,410
Do you understand?

637
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:33,120
Good.

638
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:41,410
I hope you get your head chopped off, asshole!

639
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,330
And you, shut it!

640
01:18:08,750 --> 01:18:11,250
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

641
01:18:19,830 --> 01:18:20,790
What the hell

642
01:18:34,910 --> 01:18:37,370
Okay, Marine. This is for real.

643
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:44,250
Let's go!

644
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:50,250
Go, go, go! Come on! Come on!

645
01:19:02,830 --> 01:19:04,870
What the hell's going on?

646
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,290
For God's sake

647
01:21:12,950 --> 01:21:14,330
- God help us.
- Look at that!

648
01:21:52,580 --> 01:21:54,040
Mother of God

649
01:21:58,500 --> 01:21:59,750
Mom!

650
01:22:04,910 --> 01:22:07,290
Hey, where you're going with my car?

651
01:22:07,700 --> 01:22:11,000
Help me, Daddy! Daddy! Help me!

652
01:22:11,020 --> 01:22:13,020
Oh Daddy! Daddy! Help me!

653
01:22:20,330 --> 01:22:25,580
Frank, will you take it easy, I'm tellin' ya I checked everywhere,
with everybody. There just aren't any witnesses.

654
01:22:26,540 --> 01:22:27,660
That's New York for you.

655
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:30,540
20 people standing around, nobody saw a goddamned thing.

656
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:34,040
- Tell me about this Matunas? What is he, on drugs?
- He's a survival nut.

657
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:37,080
- What do you mean "survival"?
- He's into guns. He's a Marine, a Vietnam vet.

658
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,040
I talked to his ex-CO. He said the guy was a little paranoid, but he was a good man.

659
01:22:44,700 --> 01:22:48,700
- How you doing kid?
- Okay I guess, for a guy who got 3 feet of steel crammed through his gut

660
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:50,720
How you doin' old man.

661
01:22:51,540 --> 01:22:54,250
I understand you saw the guy that stuck you? Is that right?

662
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,160
You kidding me, man?

663
01:22:56,580 --> 01:22:58,120
Is that him?

664
01:22:58,620 --> 01:22:59,670
Nope.

665
01:23:00,790 --> 01:23:04,790
- Quit kidding Matunas. It was dark in that alley.
- The freak was trying to kill me!

666
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:10,330
I'll never forget his face. He had a scar across his neck. That ain't him.

667
01:23:10,750 --> 01:23:11,870
Shit!

668
01:23:14,830 --> 01:23:16,870
- Depressed?
- Yeah.

669
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:20,700
You don't know grunt about depressed.

670
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,120
I got me a 357, got me a trunk load of shotguns,

671
01:23:25,540 --> 01:23:28,700
I got 3 big bore battle rifles and ammo up the ass.

672
01:23:29,290 --> 01:23:31,910
But I ain't safe. I can't protect myself!

673
01:23:32,330 --> 01:23:34,780
Okay, take it easy, pal. Take it easy

674
01:23:34,790 --> 01:23:37,580
That weirdo, man. He got up...

675
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:42,160
after I'd put enough lead in him to drop a rhino.

676
01:23:42,580 --> 01:23:45,810
Hey, listen, listen. You think you could work with one of our artists,

677
01:23:45,870 --> 01:23:50,580
- maybe come up with a picture of this guy?
- Sure, sure, yes.

678
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,200
Take it easy, pal.

679
01:23:54,330 --> 01:23:56,200
- Hey, cop!
- Yeah?

680
01:23:56,620 --> 01:23:58,660
I know you guys think I'm nuts,

681
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,100
but there's something else I gotta tell you.

682
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:06,360
After he threw me against the wall... [inaudible]

683
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:29,150
- This is getting like "One Step Beyond".
- Yeah. Listen, when we get out there, remember all we've got is an eye-witness.

684
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:33,850
Now, don't say anything about swordfights in New York City,
or guys glowing in the dark. For Christs sake.

685
01:24:35,380 --> 01:24:36,880
Hey, Moran!

686
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,410
Have you read what it says in here?

687
01:24:39,830 --> 01:24:42,910
You kidding, Tony? You know cops can't read.

688
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:45,790
What does "incompetent" mean?

689
01:24:47,250 --> 01:24:51,250
That mayor. He calls me at 2 o'clock in the morning.

690
01:24:51,660 --> 01:24:53,910
I mean I don't answer the phone anymore.

691
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:57,080
Hey uh... What does "baffled" mean?

692
01:25:28,700 --> 01:25:31,700
Karen Joan Nash

693
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,580
Yeah, I remember this one.

694
01:25:36,000 --> 01:25:40,830
- I was practicing in Syracuse; didn't get many of these.
- What?

695
01:25:41,250 --> 01:25:45,290
Unwed mothers. Nowadays, that's no big deal.

696
01:25:46,580 --> 01:25:49,540
Back then in Syracuse... that was a stoning offense.

697
01:25:51,950 --> 01:25:52,950
What happened?

698
01:25:54,250 --> 01:25:57,660
- She had the baby and she died.
- So, Nash was illegitimate?

699
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,250
Oh, yeah. Yeah he was illegitimate.

700
01:26:01,660 --> 01:26:05,200
For about a minute and a half. He died right after she did.

701
01:26:09,660 --> 01:26:11,000
He died?

702
01:26:22,040 --> 01:26:23,450
Hello, Brenda.

703
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:28,690
I did what you asked. I spent all night going through
the old deeds to Nash's house in Hudson Street,

704
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:33,790
all the way back through the five previous owners to the original guy, Montague in 1796.

705
01:26:34,200 --> 01:26:37,370
In all five instances, Montague through Nash,

706
01:26:37,790 --> 01:26:41,410
I found a death certificate for a kid with the same name who died at birth,

707
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:45,500
years before he pretended to sign for his inheritance.

708
01:26:46,540 --> 01:26:48,410
Jesus Rick, isn't there any heat in here?

709
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:50,830
No, heat is bad for the circuits.

710
01:26:51,250 --> 01:26:54,120
Now, just in case there's any doubt...

711
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:21,040
So what you've got here Brenda is a guy who's been creeping around since at least 1700;

712
01:27:21,450 --> 01:27:23,620
pretending to croak every once in a while;

713
01:27:24,040 --> 01:27:27,830
leaving all these goods to kids who've been corpses for years

714
01:27:28,200 --> 01:27:30,370
and assuming their identities.

715
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,950
That's not possible.

716
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:44,080
"Post" final! Cops release Headhunter picture!

717
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:47,910
Reward offered! Headhunter revealed!

718
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:23,910
For you, my bonny Heather.

719
01:28:25,160 --> 01:28:27,040
Happy birthday.

720
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:31,200
And for you, Juan Ramirez.

721
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:35,790
Take care of her, you overdressed haggis.

722
01:29:13,080 --> 01:29:15,290
Kastagir is gone.

723
01:29:15,700 --> 01:29:18,040
Only you and I remain.

724
01:29:25,660 --> 01:29:27,370
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

725
01:29:29,080 --> 01:29:30,620
Who cuts your hair?

726
01:29:31,040 --> 01:29:33,750
I'm in disguise.

727
01:29:35,160 --> 01:29:37,830
This way no one will recognize me.

728
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:41,580
I do.

729
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:46,120
- What do you want?
- Your head.

730
01:29:47,830 --> 01:29:49,450
And the prize.

731
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:53,080
Watch.

732
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:56,080
Happy Halloween, ladies!

733
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,450
Nuns! No sense of humor

734
01:30:09,500 --> 01:30:13,950
Ramirez's blade did not cut deeply enough.

735
01:30:14,370 --> 01:30:16,250
He was right about you. You're slime.

736
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:19,160
Ramirez was an effete snob.

737
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,700
He died on his knees.

738
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:23,660
I took his head

739
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:27,660
and raped his woman before his blood was even cold.

740
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,870
I see!

741
01:30:39,700 --> 01:30:41,580
Ramirez lied.

742
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:46,660
She was not his woman.

743
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,540
She was your woman,

744
01:30:50,250 --> 01:30:52,580
and she never told you.

745
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:56,000
I wonder why.

746
01:30:56,410 --> 01:31:00,830
Perhaps I gave her something you never could

747
01:31:02,950 --> 01:31:07,290
and secretly she yearned for my return.

748
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:09,700
Holy ground, Highlander!

749
01:31:10,120 --> 01:31:13,160
Remember what Ramirez taught you.

750
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:20,450
You can't stay in here forever.

751
01:31:23,370 --> 01:31:25,370
You are weak, Highlander.

752
01:31:25,870 --> 01:31:31,290
You will always be weaker than I.

753
01:31:35,410 --> 01:31:37,120
I'll be out front.

754
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:43,250
Goodbye, MacLeod.

755
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:46,200
We will meet soon enough.

756
01:31:58,410 --> 01:32:00,500
This is the house of God.

757
01:32:00,910 --> 01:32:03,620
People are trying to pray. You're disturbing them.

758
01:32:05,290 --> 01:32:08,830
He cares about these helpless mortals?

759
01:32:10,040 --> 01:32:11,950
Of course he cares.

760
01:32:12,370 --> 01:32:14,370
He died for our sins.

761
01:32:14,790 --> 01:32:16,750
That shall be his undoing.

762
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:20,000
Father,

763
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:22,910
forgive me.

764
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:25,830
I am a worm.

765
01:32:39,250 --> 01:32:41,620
I have something to say.

766
01:32:42,040 --> 01:32:45,450
It's better to burn out than to fade away.

767
01:32:54,790 --> 01:32:56,200
I need to see him, goddamn it!

768
01:32:56,620 --> 01:32:59,620
I'm afraid that's impossible. Mr. Nash is

769
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:03,160
Mr. Nash is dead, Miss Ellenstein!

770
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:09,290
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for a dead guy named Nash.

771
01:33:09,700 --> 01:33:11,750
He died at birth in Syracuse, New York.

772
01:33:18,040 --> 01:33:19,200
Alright.

773
01:33:20,370 --> 01:33:21,750
Come on.

774
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,290
Are the claymores real?

775
01:33:51,870 --> 01:33:56,120
What is this? A museum? This stuff must be worth a fortune.

776
01:34:05,000 --> 01:34:08,160
I've been alive for four and a half centuries.

777
01:34:08,580 --> 01:34:10,080
I cannot die.

778
01:34:12,830 --> 01:34:15,250
Well, everybody's got their problems.

779
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,410
What're you gonna do with that?

780
01:34:23,830 --> 01:34:25,370
Take it.

781
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:43,080
I am Connor MacLeod of the clan MacLeod.

782
01:34:43,830 --> 01:34:48,620
I was born in 1518 in the village of Glenfinnan on the shores of Loch Shiel.

783
01:34:50,870 --> 01:34:52,580
And I am immortal.

784
01:36:31,700 --> 01:36:37,200
- You're not listening.
- Brenda, it isn't going to work. I can't get involved, not again.

785
01:36:50,540 --> 01:36:52,790
You know what's weird?

786
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,450
Most people are afraid to die.

787
01:36:55,870 --> 01:36:58,040
That's not your problem.

788
01:36:58,450 --> 01:37:00,750
You're afraid to live.

789
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:07,330
Take care of yourself.

790
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:09,660
Don't lose your head.

791
01:37:25,330 --> 01:37:27,200
Hello, pretty.

792
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:32,910
Come on! Open up!

793
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:43,620
Mamma mia

794
01:38:05,660 --> 01:38:07,160
You ever played chicken?

795
01:38:12,880 --> 01:38:14,680
Here we go!

796
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:18,500
Watch out!

797
01:38:53,500 --> 01:38:54,700
Excuse me!

798
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:00,320
Oh, no!

799
01:39:18,370 --> 01:39:19,750
Watch out! A truck!

800
01:39:39,070 --> 01:39:42,070
New York, New York

801
01:39:43,490 --> 01:39:45,790
I want to wake...

802
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,840
- Shut up.
- ...in the city...

803
01:39:48,000 --> 01:39:51,450
- Shut up.
- Sing along. Shut up!

804
01:39:53,300 --> 01:39:56,100
...to find I'm king of the hill...

805
01:39:58,830 --> 01:40:00,160
Shut up!

806
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:04,280
Shut up!

807
01:40:41,540 --> 01:40:46,540
I can entertain myself. Your friend is a real screamer. Listen.

808
01:40:47,450 --> 01:40:50,000
Which part should I cut off first?

809
01:40:50,410 --> 01:40:52,120
I'll be waiting.

810
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,790
The endless killing has driven him mad.

811
01:41:01,200 --> 01:41:04,280
Rachel, there are some instructions in the desk drawer.

812
01:41:04,300 --> 01:41:05,990
I want you to follow them.

813
01:41:06,000 --> 01:41:10,370
There is a power of attorney for you. You'll have everything you need.

814
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:13,160
You're not coming back

815
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:18,660
Even if you kill him you're not coming back, are you?

816
01:41:28,200 --> 01:41:33,200
Sweet Rachel, you always knew this would happen.

817
01:41:34,250 --> 01:41:36,450
Russell Nash dies tonight.

818
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:54,660
Hey, it's a kind of magic

819
01:42:04,080 --> 01:42:05,750
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

820
01:47:23,500 --> 01:47:25,450
So now it ends.

821
01:47:44,040 --> 01:47:45,620
What kept you?

822
01:50:01,500 --> 01:50:03,450
There can be only one.

823
01:50:36,200 --> 01:50:39,200
The Quickening overpowers me!

824
01:50:40,080 --> 01:50:42,290
I know everything!

825
01:50:43,080 --> 01:50:46,200
I know! I know everything!

826
01:50:46,220 --> 01:50:48,220
I am everything!

827
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:50,410
So, this is where it all began.

828
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:54,120
Can you tell me about the prize?

829
01:51:54,540 --> 01:51:56,750
It's like a whirlwind in my head.

830
01:51:57,160 --> 01:52:02,080
But if I concentrate, I know what people are thinking all over the world.

831
01:52:02,500 --> 01:52:04,410
Presidents, diplomats,

832
01:52:04,830 --> 01:52:06,370
scientists.

833
01:52:06,790 --> 01:52:09,660
I can help them understand each other.

834
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:12,410
What am I thinking?

835
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:16,540
You're thinking whether or not you can love me. You can.

836
01:52:16,950 --> 01:52:22,200
I'm just like you. I can love and have children. Live and grow old.

837
01:52:22,620 --> 01:52:26,160
You never prepared me for that, you Spanish peacock.

838
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:32,080
Patience, Highlander. You have done well.

839
01:52:32,540 --> 01:52:34,290
But it will take time.

840
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:37,700
You are generations being born and dying.

841
01:52:39,750 --> 01:52:41,830
You are at one with all living things.

842
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:45,620
Each man's thoughts and dreams are yours to know.

843
01:52:47,200 --> 01:52:49,700
You have power beyond imagination.

844
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:55,040
Use it well, my friend. Don't lose your head.
