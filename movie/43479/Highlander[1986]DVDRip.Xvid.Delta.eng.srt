And I love you.

850
01:11:31,508 --> 01:11:34,408
I don't want to die.

851
01:11:34,408 --> 01:11:38,908
I want to stay
with you forever.

852
01:11:38,908 --> 01:11:40,908
I want that too.

853
01:11:40,908 --> 01:11:44,508
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

854
01:11:46,908 --> 01:11:48,408
What, lass?

855
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:52,408
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

856
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,508
and remember me
on my birthday?

857
01:11:55,608 --> 01:12:00,208
Aye, love. I will.

858
01:12:00,308 --> 01:12:04,008
I wanted to have
your children.

859
01:12:04,108 --> 01:12:08,308
They would have been
strong and fine.

860
01:12:12,508 --> 01:12:14,908
Don't see me, Connor.

861
01:12:15,008 --> 01:12:17,708
Let me die in peace.

862
01:12:20,308 --> 01:12:22,608
Where are we?

863
01:12:29,008 --> 01:12:31,908
We're in the highlands.

864
01:12:33,808 --> 01:12:35,908
Where else?

865
01:12:38,808 --> 01:12:41,408
Running down a mountainside.

866
01:12:55,308 --> 01:12:57,608
The sun is shining.

867
01:12:58,808 --> 01:13:00,408
It's not cold.

868
01:13:02,408 --> 01:13:05,308
You've got your sheepskins on...

869
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:11,208
and the boots
I made for you.

870
01:13:14,708 --> 01:13:17,208
Good night,
my bonny Heather.

871
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:35,008
Hey! Kastagir.

872
01:13:36,008 --> 01:13:39,408
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

873
01:13:39,508 --> 01:13:42,408
It seems like 100 years.

874
01:13:42,508 --> 01:13:45,108
It's been 100 years.

875
01:13:52,808 --> 01:13:54,708
How have you been?

876
01:13:56,608 --> 01:13:59,008
Hey, this...

877
01:13:59,008 --> 01:14:02,908
puts hairs on your chest.

878
01:14:05,408 --> 01:14:06,908
What is it?

879
01:14:07,008 --> 01:14:08,308
Boom-boom.

880
01:14:08,408 --> 01:14:09,908
Big strong man like you...

881
01:14:10,008 --> 01:14:12,708
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

882
01:14:12,808 --> 01:14:15,808
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

883
01:14:15,908 --> 01:14:17,708
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

884
01:14:19,208 --> 01:14:23,108
So...
the gathering is here.

885
01:14:23,208 --> 01:14:25,108
Ahh.

886
01:14:25,208 --> 01:14:27,408
Time's almost
caught us, friend.

887
01:14:27,408 --> 01:14:30,408
Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

888
01:14:32,608 --> 01:14:35,008
I think we should
have a party.

889
01:14:35,108 --> 01:14:38,308
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

890
01:14:38,408 --> 01:14:39,408
Really?

891
01:14:39,408 --> 01:14:40,908
When exactly was that?

892
01:14:41,008 --> 01:14:42,908
It was 1783.

893
01:14:43,008 --> 01:14:45,608
1783.

894
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:47,108
Oh, yes.

895
01:14:47,108 --> 01:14:49,608
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

896
01:14:49,608 --> 01:14:51,108
Ha ha ha!
You were drunk.

897
01:14:51,108 --> 01:14:53,608
What was that guy's name again?

898
01:14:53,608 --> 01:14:55,108
His name was Bassett.

899
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:56,508
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

900
01:14:56,608 --> 01:14:57,608
I implore you.

901
01:14:57,608 --> 01:15:01,208
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.

902
01:15:01,308 --> 01:15:03,508
See if the imbecile is ready.

903
01:15:03,608 --> 01:15:06,008
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

904
01:15:06,108 --> 01:15:07,908
Tell him I'm ready.

905
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:10,808
Christ! I've gone blind.

906
01:15:11,708 --> 01:15:13,608
En garde, sir.

907

Ohh!

908
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:18,808
Wonderful, sir.

909
01:15:18,908 --> 01:15:20,708
Thank you, Hotchkiss.

910
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,508
Bassett?

911
01:15:22,508 --> 01:15:24,808
That you?

912
01:15:24,808 --> 01:15:27,008
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

913
01:15:29,808 --> 01:15:31,308
Unh!

914
01:15:31,308 --> 01:15:32,408
Oh.

Stop, sir.

I beseech you.

919
01:15:51,508 --> 01:15:54,408
I apologize for
calling your wife...

- Ha ha ha!

And I bid you good day.

Shoot him.

924

Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!

925
01:16:06,408 --> 01:16:09,408

Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure...

01:16:39,308 --> 01:16:41,808
the mayor's office issued
the following statement...

01:16:41,908 --> 01:16:43,408
Give us a drink, pal.

Don't ever speak to me.
