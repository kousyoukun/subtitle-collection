1
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,879
Macleod.

2
00:05:29,963 --> 00:05:32,845
Fasil. Wait.

3
00:05:52,539 --> 00:05:53,979
All right.

4
00:10:47,059 --> 00:10:48,900
Macleod!

5
00:10:50,782 --> 00:10:52,703
Clan Macleod!

6
00:11:02,909 --> 00:11:06,632
May this year
of our Lord 1536...

7
00:11:06,713 --> 00:11:10,074
bring victory
to the Clan Macleod!

8
00:11:10,115 --> 00:11:11,435
Macleod!

9
00:11:11,516 --> 00:11:14,518
Victory to Macleod!

10
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:23,123
Hurry up! Hurry up!

11
00:11:25,725 --> 00:11:28,127
Are you scared, Connor?

12
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,568
Ha ha ha!

13
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,889
No, Cousin Dugal.
I'm not!

14
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:34,091
Don't talk nonsense, man.

15
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:38,214
I peed my kilt the first time
I went into battle.

16
00:11:38,254 --> 00:11:39,455
Oh, aye.

17
00:11:39,534 --> 00:11:41,776
Angus pees his kilt
all the time!

18
00:12:03,351 --> 00:12:04,592
Connor!

19
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:06,793
Connor, wait!

20
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,875
Wait!

21
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:12,277
Take these flowers
and think of me.

22
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:17,641
Remember, you fight with God
on your side, Connor.

23
00:12:17,761 --> 00:12:19,762
A girl like that
can wound a soldier...

24
00:12:19,842 --> 00:12:21,683
more than a Frazer sword,
my friend.

25
00:12:21,764 --> 00:12:24,365
Angus! You and Dugal
keep him in one piece!

26
00:12:24,485 --> 00:12:27,047
Aye, we all know
what piece that is!

27
00:13:08,515 --> 00:13:11,957
There is one called Connor
among them.

28
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:13,318
Aye.

29
00:13:18,682 --> 00:13:20,603
Remember our
agreement, Murdoch.

30
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:24,366
The boy is mine.

31
00:13:24,446 --> 00:13:26,288
It's begun.

32
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:32,131
Death to the Macleods!

33
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,094
Yay! Yay!

34
00:13:40,457 --> 00:13:42,298
Death to the Frazers!

35
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:44,299
Yay! Yah!

36
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,154
Macleod!

37
00:14:20,124 --> 00:14:21,685
Come on!

38
00:14:21,725 --> 00:14:23,286
Macleod!

39
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:29,050
Now you stay under.

40
00:14:30,491 --> 00:14:33,853
Forgive me... my son.

41
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,096
Fight me, damn you!

42
00:14:37,136 --> 00:14:38,816
Fight me, cowards!

43
00:14:38,936 --> 00:14:40,458
No, not him!

44
00:14:48,223 --> 00:14:50,064
Castrate the heathens!

45
00:14:50,064 --> 00:14:51,865
Nobody will fight me!

46
00:14:51,985 --> 00:14:54,388
They all run away.

47
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:57,749
Here, laddie, stay by me.

48
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:05,595
Mother of God.

49
00:15:10,398 --> 00:15:11,840
Fight me!

50
00:15:24,688 --> 00:15:26,810
No!

51
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:29,091
Come on, quick!

52
00:15:29,131 --> 00:15:30,933
There can be only one!

53
00:15:33,894 --> 00:15:35,816
Another time, Macleod!

54
00:16:08,638 --> 00:16:10,919
Get out of the car!

55
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:14,321
Put your hands
on the hood!

56
00:16:14,362 --> 00:16:16,243
Move!

57
00:16:16,323 --> 00:16:18,444
Okay!

58
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,687
Watch it, freak!
Just cool it!

59
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:23,208
Watch him!
Watch him!

60
00:16:23,247 --> 00:16:26,610
Move! Come on!
Come on! Move!

61
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:28,692
Come on!
Get up there!

62
00:16:28,731 --> 00:16:30,293
Aah!

63
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,773
Spread 'em!
Spread 'em!

64
00:16:31,893 --> 00:16:33,975
Come on!

65
00:16:34,095 --> 00:16:36,777
Let's see
some I.D., pal.

66
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:39,859
Well, Mr. Nash.

67
00:16:39,939 --> 00:16:43,982
Where were you going
in such a hurry?

68
00:16:44,062 --> 00:16:47,824
Give me it!
Give me it!

69
00:16:47,905 --> 00:16:48,866
Ooh!

70
00:16:53,549 --> 00:16:56,350
Don't move, pal.

71
00:16:56,431 --> 00:16:58,472
Don't even breathe!

72
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:41,061
In nomine patri et filii
et spiritu sancti.

73
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,422
Amen.

74
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:46,144
It is over.

75
00:17:46,184 --> 00:17:47,585
No!

76
00:17:47,705 --> 00:17:50,107
Other men are
dying this day.

77
00:17:50,187 --> 00:17:52,188
I must attend them.

78
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:54,710
Quiet!

79
00:17:58,633 --> 00:18:01,035
He's a highlander, by God!

80
00:18:01,075 --> 00:18:03,396
The last sound he hears...

81
00:18:03,437 --> 00:18:06,999
shouldn't be that
of a wailing woman!

82
00:18:30,695 --> 00:18:32,416
Hey, let me through.

83
00:18:32,496 --> 00:18:36,138
Damn it, Frank.
Forensics is supposed to be notified...

84
00:18:36,258 --> 00:18:38,380
the same time as homicide.

85
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,821
Holy shit.

86
00:18:39,901 --> 00:18:41,622
Yeah, this one came unassembled.

87
00:18:41,742 --> 00:18:43,143
Did you make an arrest?

88
00:18:43,263 --> 00:18:46,226
No. We're questioning
some guy named Nash.

89
00:18:46,346 --> 00:18:48,747
Antique dealer on Hudson Street.

90
00:18:48,747 --> 00:18:51,108
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, Walt.

91
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:53,350
You look pretty, Brenda.

92
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,751
What do you think's...

93
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:57,313
the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?

94
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,874
You're a barrel
of laughs, Garfield.

95
00:18:59,955 --> 00:19:01,796
Get your hands off!

96
00:19:01,876 --> 00:19:04,918
Try explaining this to my wife!

97
00:19:04,918 --> 00:19:07,920
Get me a cherry-cheese danish too.

98
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,041
What time did he buy it?

99
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,522
About 10:00, 10:30.

100
00:19:11,562 --> 00:19:14,164
Whatever cut him
was razor sharp.

101
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:18,007
Get out of here
with these cameras!

102
00:19:18,087 --> 00:19:19,928
Frank! Frank!

103
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,930
Oh, my God.

104
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:25,692
A guy was killed
like this in Jersey.

105
00:19:25,773 --> 00:19:28,454
What the hell.
That's Jersey.

106
00:19:28,494 --> 00:19:30,015
I want out!

107
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:32,217
Hey, Frank. Come here.

108
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:35,459
Aw, shit!

109
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:40,062
Ooh, baby.
Look at you.

110
00:19:40,102 --> 00:19:43,424
Garfield, cover that head.

111
00:19:45,266 --> 00:19:47,627
Oh...

112
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:50,549
What the hell
have you got?

113
00:19:50,549 --> 00:19:52,751
A Toledo-Salamanca.

114
00:19:52,831 --> 00:19:54,071
A what?

115
00:19:54,192 --> 00:19:56,753
A sword, Frank.
A very rare sword.

116
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:58,675
Is it worth much?

117
00:19:58,795 --> 00:20:01,076
Only about a million bucks.

118
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:04,919
Any antique dealer
on Hudson Street...

119
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,360
could tell you that.

120
00:20:08,761 --> 00:20:11,643
You can't keep me here!

121
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,765
I know my rights!

122
00:20:41,023 --> 00:20:44,866
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

123
00:20:44,946 --> 00:20:47,028
His name's Vazilek,
Polish national.

124
00:20:47,067 --> 00:20:50,310
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

125
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,831
You ever get over
to New Jersey, Nash?

126
00:20:52,912 --> 00:20:54,833
Not if I can help it.

127
00:20:54,913 --> 00:20:56,754
You talk funny.
Where you from?

128
00:20:56,834 --> 00:20:58,676
Lots of different places.

129
00:20:58,755 --> 00:21:02,038
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hmm.

130
00:21:02,118 --> 00:21:04,639
Okay. What's that?

131
00:21:08,563 --> 00:21:10,084
A sword?

132
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:12,125
Wise up, smart ass.

133
00:21:13,445 --> 00:21:17,568
It's a Toledo-Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million bucks.

134
00:21:17,688 --> 00:21:18,929
So?

135
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,811
So you want to hear a theory?

136
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:24,493
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy...

137
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,895
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

138
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,816
Okay, his name's
Iman Fasil.

139
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:31,778
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

140
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:34,100
Want to hear another theory?

141
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,541
This Fasil was so upset...

142
00:21:36,582 --> 00:21:39,064
about the lousy
wrestling tonight...

143
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:45,027
in a fit of depression,
he cut off his own head.

144
00:21:45,107 --> 00:21:46,828
That's not funny, Walt.

145
00:21:46,948 --> 00:21:48,829
Are you a faggot, Nash?

146
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,552
Why? You cruising
for a piece of ass?

147
00:21:53,393 --> 00:21:55,154
I'll tell you
what happened, Russell.

148
00:21:55,194 --> 00:21:58,076
You went down to the garage
for a blow job.

149
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,278
You just didn't
want to pay for it.

150
00:22:00,398 --> 00:22:03,080
Huh. You are sick.

151
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,281
Hey! Hey!

152
00:22:05,361 --> 00:22:07,762
Hey, what are you doing?

153
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:08,923
Stop!

154
00:22:09,003 --> 00:22:11,405
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

155
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:14,767
That's enough!
Now, cut it out!

156
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:17,369
Goddamn it,
I said cut it out!

157
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:21,292
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

158
00:22:21,412 --> 00:22:23,293
Then we're through.

159
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,535
Nash, we're just
getting started.

160
00:22:28,697 --> 00:22:30,939
...in water from the sprinkler.

161
00:22:30,978 --> 00:22:33,780
It also left a man's
decapitated body...

162
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:37,142
next to his own severed head.

163
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:40,505
A head which at this time
has no name.

164
00:22:40,585 --> 00:22:42,587
I know his name.

165
00:22:44,827 --> 00:22:47,390
* Here I am *

166
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:51,232
* I'm the master
of your destiny *

167
00:22:52,313 --> 00:22:53,914
Ahh!

168
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:58,157
* I am the one
The only one *

169
00:22:58,237 --> 00:23:01,039
* I am the god
of kingdom come *

170
00:23:01,079 --> 00:23:03,240
* Give me the prize *

171
00:23:03,321 --> 00:23:05,642
* Just give me the prize **

172
00:23:15,048 --> 00:23:17,530
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger.

173
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,971
Room 315.

174
00:23:19,091 --> 00:23:22,733
And I'll hit you
for 20 in advance.

175
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:28,858
Uh, hey, uh.

176
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:31,259
If there's anything
you need...

177
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,902
Broads, uh, blow.
Just dial 0, huh?

178
00:23:35,022 --> 00:23:37,104
That's right, Mr. Kruger.

179
00:23:37,224 --> 00:23:39,905
Lucky Strike means
fine tobacco.

180
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:42,186
Don't talk to the guests.

181
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:43,829
I didn't do nothing.

182
00:24:33,662 --> 00:24:35,544
At last...

183
00:24:35,663 --> 00:24:37,384
the gathering.

184
00:24:41,427 --> 00:24:42,668
Hi.

185
00:24:42,748 --> 00:24:44,109
I'm Candy.

186
00:24:47,671 --> 00:24:49,592
Of course you are.

187
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,041
Come on in.

188
00:25:01,081 --> 00:25:04,402
Hiya. Got a present
from the coroner.

189
00:25:04,443 --> 00:25:09,246
Pieces of metal found
on the dead guy under the Garden.

190
00:25:09,286 --> 00:25:11,928
In the wound
and on the clothes.

191
00:25:12,048 --> 00:25:13,850
Real smooth shave.

192
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,262
That can't be right.

193
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:38,987
Son of a bitch.

194
00:26:35,225 --> 00:26:36,785
Who's there?

195
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,679
Hey, Brenda. Usual?

196
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:57,119
Lots of it.

197
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,561
Oh.

198
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:02,883
* Is better than
a lifetime alone *

199
00:27:02,964 --> 00:27:04,405
Say when.

200
00:27:05,765 --> 00:27:08,167
* One sentimental moment
in your arms *

201
00:27:08,247 --> 00:27:09,208
When.

202
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,170
* Is like a shooting star... *

203
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:14,772
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

204
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:17,173
Double Glenmoran on the rocks.

205
00:27:17,254 --> 00:27:18,534
Glenmoran. Right.

206
00:27:18,615 --> 00:27:21,016
Go to the Garden often?

207
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,498
What did you say?

208
00:27:23,618 --> 00:27:25,098
Hmm?

209
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:29,462
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

210
00:27:29,542 --> 00:27:34,065
* I'm falling apart all around you *

211
00:27:34,105 --> 00:27:36,067
What did you say?

212
00:27:37,507 --> 00:27:40,389
Madison... Square... Garden.

213
00:27:41,831 --> 00:27:44,152
Do you go there often?

214
00:27:44,232 --> 00:27:45,192
Why?

215
00:27:46,553 --> 00:27:47,995
Basketball?

216
00:27:48,074 --> 00:27:49,996
The circus? Wrestling?

217
00:27:50,075 --> 00:27:53,278
Why are you asking me?

218
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:55,159
Have you been following me?

219
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:59,202
I'd like to walk
you home, Brenda.

220
00:28:01,123 --> 00:28:02,564
Uh...

221
00:28:04,886 --> 00:28:08,049
I can take care of myself.

222
00:28:08,128 --> 00:28:14,453
* It's always a rainy day without you *

223
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:19,455
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

224
00:28:19,536 --> 00:28:22,898
* I'm falling apart *

225
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:26,261
* All around you *

226
00:29:16,735 --> 00:29:17,776
Huh!

227
00:29:17,776 --> 00:29:18,776
Aah!

228
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,098
Be quiet!

229
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:21,258
Unnhhrr!

230
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,981
Aah!

231
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:37,869
Here. Take this.

232
00:29:58,884 --> 00:30:01,365
Ha ha ha!

233
00:30:02,446 --> 00:30:04,007
Aah!

234
00:30:04,047 --> 00:30:05,608
Oh!

235
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,932
Nice to see you
again, Macleod.

236
00:30:10,011 --> 00:30:11,732
Nice to see you...

237
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:13,734
Ooh!

238
00:30:13,774 --> 00:30:15,695
- Ooh!
- Stop!

239
00:30:15,775 --> 00:30:17,496
There can be only one!

240
00:30:21,139 --> 00:30:22,780
No!

241
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,940
Unh!

242
00:30:24,021 --> 00:30:25,181
Unnhhrr!

243
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:27,703
You, on the ground.

244
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:29,224
This is the police.

245
00:30:29,304 --> 00:30:31,306
Put down your weapons.

246
00:30:31,346 --> 00:30:33,347
Hands on your head.

247
00:30:33,427 --> 00:30:36,229
Another time, Highlander!
I will find you!

248
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:39,191
Hold it right there!

249
00:30:39,271 --> 00:30:41,032
Come back here!

250
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:45,315
Stop!

251
00:30:45,435 --> 00:30:46,756
Wait!

252
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,197
Who was that?

253
00:30:48,317 --> 00:30:49,638
He called you Highlander.

254
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:51,559
"There can be only one"?

255
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,001
Only one what?

256
00:30:53,121 --> 00:30:55,883
- I want to know!
- Shut up!

257
00:30:56,003 --> 00:30:58,765
Don't you ever
follow me again.

258
00:30:58,844 --> 00:31:01,166
You only have one life.

259
00:31:01,246 --> 00:31:04,248
If you value it...
go home.

260
00:31:09,812 --> 00:31:12,293
Ha ha!

261
00:31:15,576 --> 00:31:17,497
You saw the wound.

262
00:31:17,497 --> 00:31:19,379
He should have died.

263
00:31:19,418 --> 00:31:22,261
I say he's got
the devil in him.

264
00:31:41,954 --> 00:31:44,836
Drinking with us, are you?

265
00:31:44,916 --> 00:31:46,436
What's the matter, Dugal?

266
00:31:46,477 --> 00:31:47,998
You, talking
and breathing...

267
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:51,160
and last night,
all but a corpse.

268
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,801
How did you manage that?

269
00:31:52,881 --> 00:31:55,003
You'd rather I was dead?

270
00:31:55,082 --> 00:31:56,924
It's not natural.

271
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:01,727
He's in league with Lucifer.

272
00:32:01,807 --> 00:32:04,810
Don't say that, Kate.

273
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,571
I'll say it.

274
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,732
You've the devil in you.

275
00:32:08,812 --> 00:32:11,494
We've been kinsmen 20 years.

276
00:32:11,534 --> 00:32:14,216
Connor Macleod was my kinsman.

277
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:17,458
I don't know who you are.

278
00:32:22,821 --> 00:32:23,902
Angus.

279
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,823
You better go, Connor.

280
00:32:28,506 --> 00:32:30,627
I'm not going anywhere.

281
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,708
He's the devil!
Kill him!

282
00:32:32,828 --> 00:32:33,869
Lucifer!

283
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:42,515
Burn the devil out of him!

284
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:53,722
All right.
Get him down.

285
00:32:53,842 --> 00:32:54,884
Burn him!

286
00:32:55,844 --> 00:32:57,845
Leave him be!

287
00:32:57,886 --> 00:32:59,127
Dugal...

288
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:00,928
Oh!

289
00:33:01,048 --> 00:33:04,009
He's your cousin, man!

290
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,896
No, Angus!

291
00:33:13,977 --> 00:33:14,937
Quiet!

292
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:16,498
Quiet!

293
00:33:17,459 --> 00:33:19,540
There'll be no burning
here today!

294
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,102
We'll banish him!

295
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:23,783
No! Burn him!

296
00:33:23,864 --> 00:33:25,224
Stop it, Kate!

297
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,665
Burn him!

298
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:30,107
Angus, burn him!

299
00:33:30,188 --> 00:33:31,269
Can you walk?

300
00:33:31,348 --> 00:33:33,670
I'll bloody well
walk out of here.

301
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,952
Then go!
While there's still time.

302
00:33:37,313 --> 00:33:39,914
I'll not forget you, Angus.

303
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:45,640
That's a good dog.

304
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:56,368
Pie and ale.
Do you want it?

305
00:35:56,447 --> 00:35:58,769
Aye. Right now.

306
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:02,131
You filthy sod!
You're all muck and muscle.

307
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:05,853
Aye, blossom.
The way you like it.

308
00:36:05,974 --> 00:36:07,695
Ha ha ha!

309
00:36:07,735 --> 00:36:09,416
Ha ha!

310
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:10,577
Ahh!

311
00:36:10,617 --> 00:36:11,617
Waah!

312
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:29,270
You can do that to me
forever, my lord.

313
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:33,872
Will you, Connor?

314
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:36,474
Aye, blossom. I will.

315
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:44,640
Whoa!

316
00:36:49,643 --> 00:36:51,085
Greetings.

317
00:36:51,164 --> 00:36:54,527
I am Juan Sanchez
Villa-Lobos Ramirez...

318
00:36:54,607 --> 00:36:58,650
chief metallurgist
to King Charles V of Spain...

319
00:36:58,689 --> 00:37:00,971
and I'm at your service.

320
00:37:01,051 --> 00:37:02,492
Who?

321
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:08,336
What do you want?

322
00:37:08,456 --> 00:37:09,977
You.

323
00:37:12,859 --> 00:37:14,300
You're Connor Macleod.

324
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,942
Maybe I am and...

325
00:37:16,021 --> 00:37:19,464
You're Connor Macleod,
wounded in battle...

326
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,946
and driven from your village
five years ago.

327
00:37:23,026 --> 00:37:24,627
- Connor!
- Ohh!

328
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:27,069
Heather, go in the house.

329
00:37:27,069 --> 00:37:29,470
I'll stay right here.

330
00:37:29,551 --> 00:37:31,472
Do as I say, woman!

331
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:41,999
Aaah!

332
00:37:41,999 --> 00:37:43,841
Aah!

333
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,281
Aaah!

334
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:50,085
The sensation you're feeling
is the quickening.

335
00:37:51,726 --> 00:37:53,167
Who are you?

336
00:37:53,247 --> 00:37:55,648
We are the same, Macleod!

337
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:59,131
We are brothers!

338
00:38:04,854 --> 00:38:08,136
I knew you guys
were bottle-fed.

339
00:38:08,217 --> 00:38:13,420
Well, there's not a lot
I can do about it, pal.

340
00:38:13,461 --> 00:38:15,662
See what I'm up against?

341
00:38:15,702 --> 00:38:18,984
His Vietnamese neighbor
ate his dog.

342
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:21,266
Uh...
that's confidential.

343
00:38:21,386 --> 00:38:23,187
How are things
in forensics?

344
00:38:23,228 --> 00:38:25,509
Dull. How about lunch?

345
00:38:25,588 --> 00:38:28,391
Lunch? It's a good idea.
Who pays?

346
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,551
Me.

347
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,992
You're on.

348
00:38:31,072 --> 00:38:32,914
By the way, Frank...

349
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:35,276
the hairs in the Moretti case...

350
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:36,716
matched up.

351
00:38:36,836 --> 00:38:39,238
Oh, I forgot my purse.

352
00:38:39,238 --> 00:38:41,600
I'll meet you outside.

353
00:38:41,639 --> 00:38:44,602
Garfield, Brenda and I
are going to lunch.

354
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:29,032
Sometimes, Macleod...

355
00:39:29,152 --> 00:39:31,994
the sharpest blade is not enough.

356
00:39:35,277 --> 00:39:43,161
* B-A-L-A-N-C-E
Balance **

357
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:45,163
I don't like boats!
I don't like water!

358
00:39:45,243 --> 00:39:48,045
I'm a man, not a fish.

359
00:39:48,125 --> 00:39:50,046
Oh, you complain endlessly.

360
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:53,809
You look like a woman,
you stupid haggis.

361
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:55,250
Haggis? What is haggis?

362
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,451
Sheep's stomach stuffed
with meat and barley.

363
00:39:57,531 --> 00:40:00,053
And what do you
do with it?

364
00:40:00,134 --> 00:40:02,055
You eat it.

365
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:03,976
How revolting.

366
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:05,017
Ah-choo!

367
00:40:05,137 --> 00:40:07,618
Be still.
You'll tip us over!

368
00:40:07,698 --> 00:40:08,619
So?

369
00:40:08,659 --> 00:40:11,341
I cannot swim,
you Spanish peacock.

370
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:12,742
I'm not Spanish.
I'm Egyptian.

371
00:40:12,781 --> 00:40:15,663
You said you were
from Spain! Liar!

372
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:19,026
You have the manners
of a goat...

373
00:40:19,146 --> 00:40:22,388
and you smell like dung.

374
00:40:22,509 --> 00:40:25,670
And you have no knowledge
whatsoever of your potential.

375
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,471
Now, get out!

376
00:40:27,512 --> 00:40:28,633
No!

377
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:31,034
Help!

378
00:40:31,114 --> 00:40:33,516
Help! Help!

379
00:40:35,437 --> 00:40:37,358
Help!

380
00:40:37,478 --> 00:40:39,200
Help me, I'm drowning!

381
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,082
You can't drown, you fool.
You're immortal!

382
00:40:44,763 --> 00:40:47,326
I'm drowning!
Come help!

383
00:40:47,365 --> 00:40:53,409
* We ask you...
Heavenly Father *

384
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:57,132
I'm alive.

385
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:03,456
I can breathe.

386
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,104
Ha ha ha!

387
00:41:14,143 --> 00:41:15,945
Ha ha ha ha!

388
00:41:21,709 --> 00:41:24,190
I'll slice you in half.

389
00:41:47,246 --> 00:41:48,207
Hah!

390
00:41:49,328 --> 00:41:50,969
Crude and slow, clansman.

391
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:54,811
Your attack was no better
than that of a clumsy child.

392
00:41:54,891 --> 00:41:56,933
Hah!

393
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:06,619
This cannot be.
It's the devil's work.

394
00:42:09,301 --> 00:42:13,545
You cannot die, Macleod.
Accept it.

395
00:42:13,624 --> 00:42:14,985
Ha ha ha!

396
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,706
Ha ha ha!

397
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:19,668
I hate you.

398
00:42:19,709 --> 00:42:20,589
Good.

399
00:42:20,629 --> 00:42:22,750
That is a perfect
way to start.

400
00:42:24,551 --> 00:42:25,473
Tell me...

401
00:42:25,512 --> 00:42:27,634
how did it happen,
for God's sake?

402
00:42:30,516 --> 00:42:33,878
Why does the sun
come up, hmm?

403
00:42:33,958 --> 00:42:37,801
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night?

404
00:42:37,921 --> 00:42:39,682
Who knows?

405
00:42:39,722 --> 00:42:41,443
What I do know is...

406
00:42:41,563 --> 00:42:43,284
because you were
born different...

407
00:42:43,364 --> 00:42:47,607
men will fear you,
try to drive you away...

408
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:49,889
like the people
of your village.

409
00:43:00,256 --> 00:43:04,098
You must learn to conceal
your special gift...

410
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:05,940
and harness your power...

411
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,982
until the time
of the gathering.

412
00:43:11,784 --> 00:43:13,225
What gathering?

413
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,987
When only a few of us
are left...

414
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:17,748
we will feel
an irresistible pull...

415
00:43:17,828 --> 00:43:20,990
towards a faraway land...

416
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:22,992
to fight for the prize.

417
00:43:26,274 --> 00:43:27,635
Come on!

418
00:43:28,595 --> 00:43:30,117
Faster!

419
00:43:37,682 --> 00:43:39,082
Unh!

420
00:43:39,122 --> 00:43:41,044
Never lose your temper.

421
00:43:41,164 --> 00:43:44,406
If your head comes away
from your neck...

422
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,847
it's over.

423
00:43:52,092 --> 00:43:53,452
Ha ha ha!

424
00:44:08,783 --> 00:44:09,743
Unnh!

425
00:44:09,823 --> 00:44:12,625
Never overextend
your thrust.

426
00:44:12,705 --> 00:44:14,947
You're vulnerable and...

427
00:44:15,026 --> 00:44:16,828
off balance.

428
00:44:16,868 --> 00:44:18,950
Connor! Ha ha ha!

429
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:22,232
Heather, please.

430
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,323
If it came down to us two,
would you take my head?

431
00:44:39,404 --> 00:44:40,764
Ha!

432
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:45,728
We must fight
until only one remains.

433
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:49,010
You are safe only on holy ground.

434
00:44:49,090 --> 00:44:52,532
None of us will violate that law.

435
00:44:52,652 --> 00:44:54,094
It's tradition.

436
00:45:06,382 --> 00:45:08,383
Now for the last.

437
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:10,985
Trust me.

438
00:45:14,428 --> 00:45:17,029
Let yourself
feel the stag.

439
00:45:19,911 --> 00:45:21,713
His heart...

440
00:45:21,833 --> 00:45:23,273
beating.

441
00:45:30,078 --> 00:45:33,040
His blood... coursing.

442
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,961
Feel?

443
00:45:36,122 --> 00:45:37,483
Come on!

444
00:45:37,563 --> 00:45:40,445
I feel him.

445
00:45:40,526 --> 00:45:42,927
Macleod, come on!

446
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:44,368
I feel him!

447
00:45:44,488 --> 00:45:46,489
Come on!

448
00:45:46,529 --> 00:45:48,491
Ha ha ha!

449
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:50,892
I feel him!

450
00:45:50,932 --> 00:45:55,375
Ha ha ha!

451
00:45:55,415 --> 00:45:57,617
Come on, haggis!

452
00:46:00,899 --> 00:46:02,901
Macleod.

453
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:05,182
This is the quickening.

454
00:46:05,302 --> 00:46:07,103
Yeah!

455
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:08,384
Yaah!

456
00:46:39,765 --> 00:46:41,246
Now, pendejo...

457
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:45,129
shall we see what sort of
swordsman you've become?

458
00:46:45,209 --> 00:46:46,931
En garde!

459
00:46:54,736 --> 00:46:56,257
Very good.

460
00:47:13,909 --> 00:47:16,871
Give me your hand, brother.

461
00:47:32,642 --> 00:47:34,443
That one there.

462
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:36,564
How much is it?

463
00:47:52,015 --> 00:47:53,815
Put him in.

464
00:47:53,815 --> 00:47:56,618
But what I want is a family.

465
00:47:56,658 --> 00:47:59,420
You cannot have a family.

466
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,781
We cannot have children.

467
00:48:01,902 --> 00:48:04,102
That won't please Heather.

468
00:48:04,183 --> 00:48:07,065
I'll tell you that
for nothing.

469
00:48:07,105 --> 00:48:09,667
He's full of life.

470
00:48:11,028 --> 00:48:12,549
Connor!

471
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,871
Here's dinner!

472
00:48:18,672 --> 00:48:20,074
I'll be off now.

473
00:48:20,114 --> 00:48:22,635
I fancy buying
a new dress.

474
00:48:25,878 --> 00:48:29,720
Oh, you little devils!
Go on!

475
00:48:30,961 --> 00:48:32,602
She's beautiful.

476
00:48:33,963 --> 00:48:37,325
You must leave her,
brother.

477
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:49,774
Macleod.

478
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:52,656
I was born 2,437 years ago.

479
00:48:52,776 --> 00:48:56,018
In that time,
I've had three wives.

480
00:48:56,138 --> 00:48:59,381
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

481
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,943
Her father, Masamune, a genius...

482
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:05,145
made this for me...

483
00:49:05,224 --> 00:49:07,907
in 593 B.C.

484
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:12,910
It is the only one
of its kind...

485
00:49:13,030 --> 00:49:14,831
like his daughter.

486
00:49:14,912 --> 00:49:17,993
When Shakiko died,
I was shattered.

487
00:49:18,113 --> 00:49:20,915
I would save you
that pain.

488
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:23,757
Please.
Let Heather go.

489
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:45,372
When we first met,
you felt ill, remember?

490
00:49:45,372 --> 00:49:47,574
That wasn't the first time...

491
00:49:47,653 --> 00:49:50,456
you felt
that sensation, was it?

492
00:49:50,535 --> 00:49:51,896
No.

493
00:49:51,977 --> 00:49:54,258
When the Macleods
fought the Frazers...

494
00:49:54,378 --> 00:49:56,780
and a black knight...

495
00:49:56,860 --> 00:49:58,982
I felt it then.

496
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:01,383
Only it was more painful.

497
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:03,745
That black knight
was the Kurgan.

498
00:50:03,785 --> 00:50:06,667
It's because of him
that I sought you out.

499
00:50:08,107 --> 00:50:09,909
Who is the Kurgan?

500
00:50:10,029 --> 00:50:11,790
Where does
he come from?

501
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:13,951
The Kurgans were
an ancient people...

502
00:50:13,991 --> 00:50:15,553
from the steppes
of Russia.

503
00:50:15,592 --> 00:50:17,273
For amusement,
they tossed children...

504
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:21,036
into pits with hungry dogs
to fight for meat.

505
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:22,477
The Kurgan.

506
00:50:22,597 --> 00:50:25,559
He is the strongest
of the immortals.

507
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,881
He is the perfect warrior.

508
00:50:27,961 --> 00:50:30,363
If he wins the prize...

509
00:50:30,442 --> 00:50:34,205
mortal man would suffer
an eternity of darkness.

510
00:50:34,285 --> 00:50:36,606
How do you fight
such a savage?

511
00:50:36,687 --> 00:50:41,210
Hmm. With heart,
faith, and steel.

512
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:44,772
In the end,
there can be only one.

513
00:50:49,535 --> 00:50:51,777
very dangerous for you.

514
00:50:51,857 --> 00:50:54,259
Well, I was very much in love...

515
00:50:54,298 --> 00:50:55,419
with her, my dear.

516
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,102
She was the only thing
on my mind.

517
00:50:58,142 --> 00:51:00,703
So, holding the rose
in my teeth...

518
00:51:00,783 --> 00:51:04,065
I climbed up on the rooftop,
lowered a rope...

519
00:51:04,146 --> 00:51:06,347
and swung in
through the open window.

520
00:51:08,949 --> 00:51:12,031
Unfortunately, the lady
was no longer there.

521
00:51:12,031 --> 00:51:13,352
What did you do?

522
00:51:13,472 --> 00:51:14,793
I introduced myself...

523
00:51:14,873 --> 00:51:17,195
to the lady that was there.

524
00:51:17,274 --> 00:51:18,716
She was most helpful.

525
00:51:21,037 --> 00:51:23,799
Would you like
some more wine?

526
00:51:23,919 --> 00:51:25,920
Yes, please.

527
00:51:36,008 --> 00:51:37,649
Heather.

528
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:39,049
Get out!

529
00:51:39,089 --> 00:51:40,610
What's wrong?

530
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:47,775
Get out!

531
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:49,737
Aaah!

532
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:51,177
Kurgan!

533
00:51:52,619 --> 00:51:54,419
Ramirez!

534
00:51:55,581 --> 00:51:59,823
Raah!

535
00:52:03,466 --> 00:52:06,828
The Highlander,
where is he?

536
00:52:06,908 --> 00:52:08,069
You're too late.

537
00:52:08,149 --> 00:52:10,070
I've prepared him
for you.

538
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:11,591
You waste your time!

539
00:52:15,754 --> 00:52:17,275
Aah!

540
00:52:23,799 --> 00:52:25,801
Aah!

541
00:52:37,729 --> 00:52:39,931
It hurts?

542
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:45,575
Raaah!

543
00:52:45,614 --> 00:52:46,735
Aaah!

544
00:52:51,138 --> 00:52:55,181
Now you die!
Heh heh heh!

545
00:52:57,663 --> 00:53:01,705
I am the strongest!

546
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:04,587
My cut has improved
your voice.

547
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,624
Yes!

548
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:16,264
Ahh. Hurts?

549
00:55:19,784 --> 00:55:22,024
Who is the woman?

550
00:55:23,144 --> 00:55:25,064
Oh! She's mine!

551
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:29,104
Not for much longer.

552
00:55:38,304 --> 00:55:40,904
Tonight you sleep
in hell!

553
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:43,584
There can be only one!

554
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:31,264
Hello, pretty.

555
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:43,224
I'd like to speak
to Russell Nash.

556
00:56:43,344 --> 00:56:46,224
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Nash isn't here.

557
00:56:46,224 --> 00:56:48,784
May I call him at home?

558
00:56:48,904 --> 00:56:50,624
That won't be possible.

559
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:52,624
Good morning.

560
00:56:52,744 --> 00:56:55,504
This is Brenda Wyatt,
Mr. Nash.

561
00:56:56,744 --> 00:56:58,824
We've already met, Rachel.

562
00:56:58,864 --> 00:57:00,864
What can I do for you?

563
00:57:00,984 --> 00:57:02,304
I'd like some advice.

564
00:57:02,424 --> 00:57:05,104
Are you someone
who takes advice?

565
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:06,584
That depends.

566
00:57:06,624 --> 00:57:08,144
Advice about what?

567
00:57:08,184 --> 00:57:10,584
What can you tell me
about a seven-foot lunatic...

568
00:57:10,664 --> 00:57:12,184
hacking away with a broadsword...

569
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,704
at one in the morning,
New York City, 1985?

570
00:57:17,184 --> 00:57:18,904
Not much.

571
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:21,704
A Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C...

572
00:57:21,704 --> 00:57:24,104
the metal folded 200 times?

573
00:57:24,184 --> 00:57:26,784
I don't deal
in exotic weapons.

574
00:57:26,864 --> 00:57:30,424
May I show you something
in 18th-century silver?

575
00:57:30,464 --> 00:57:34,264
That's not why I came.
You know it.

576
00:57:34,344 --> 00:57:35,904
Do you cook?

577
00:57:35,984 --> 00:57:37,304
Why?

578
00:57:37,344 --> 00:57:40,304
I thought
we might have dinner.

579
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:42,024
Did you?

580
00:57:42,104 --> 00:57:43,184
Yes.

581
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:47,864
So I'm standing there,
and there's Brenda.

582
00:57:47,984 --> 00:57:50,064
Our little Brenda.

583
00:57:50,184 --> 00:57:52,784
You're sure it was Brenda?

584
00:57:52,864 --> 00:57:56,504
She was in Nash's shop
talking to him.

585
00:58:04,264 --> 00:58:06,104
What are you
looking at, Rachel?

586
00:58:06,184 --> 00:58:08,704
The eyes in the back of your head.

587
00:58:10,984 --> 00:58:13,224
People are asking
about you.

588
00:58:13,264 --> 00:58:15,504
What am I supposed to say?

589
00:58:15,584 --> 00:58:17,184
Hmm?

590
00:58:17,224 --> 00:58:18,944
Tell them I'm immortal.

591
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:53,464
Shh.

592
00:58:54,544 --> 00:58:56,264
Quiet.

593
00:59:01,344 --> 00:59:03,144
Don't be frightened.

594
00:59:03,264 --> 00:59:05,664
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

595
00:59:05,744 --> 00:59:09,184
- What happened?
- Everybody's dead.

596
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:14,584
I'm like you.
I'm alone.

597
00:59:14,664 --> 00:59:16,384
Come with me, Rachel.

598
00:59:30,224 --> 00:59:33,064
You're alive.
Why didn't you die?

599
00:59:33,184 --> 00:59:35,304
Hey. It's a kind of magic.

600
00:59:41,424 --> 00:59:43,344
- Move!
- Nein!

601
00:59:45,064 --> 00:59:47,384
Heh heh heh.
Whatever you say, Jack.

602
00:59:47,464 --> 00:59:48,984
You're the master race.

603
00:59:53,504 --> 00:59:54,744
Let's go.

604
00:59:56,784 --> 00:59:59,344
That was a long time ago.

605
00:59:59,464 --> 01:00:03,024
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

606
01:00:03,024 --> 01:00:05,304
You can't hide
your feelings from me.

607
01:00:05,384 --> 01:00:07,624
I've known you too long.

608
01:00:07,624 --> 01:00:09,144
What feelings?

609
01:00:09,224 --> 01:00:10,984
How about loneliness?

610
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:13,544
I'm not lonely.

611
01:00:13,664 --> 01:00:16,344
I've got everything
I need right here.

612
01:00:16,424 --> 01:00:17,984
Oh, no, you don't.

613
01:00:18,064 --> 01:00:23,064
You refuse to let
anyone love you.

614
01:00:23,064 --> 01:00:25,264
Love is for poets.

615
01:00:28,704 --> 01:00:32,144
You're such
a romantic, Rachel.

616
01:00:32,264 --> 01:00:35,144
You always were.

617
01:00:56,424 --> 01:00:57,784
Just a minute.

618
01:01:16,264 --> 01:01:17,824
Good evening.

619
01:01:21,824 --> 01:01:24,144
You want to dine
in the hall...

620
01:01:24,224 --> 01:01:25,944
or shall we step inside?

621
01:01:26,064 --> 01:01:27,704
Ohh.

622
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:28,944
Come in.

623
01:01:30,864 --> 01:01:32,104
May I take your coat?

624
01:01:32,144 --> 01:01:33,344
What? No, thanks.

625
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:35,264
I'll hold on to it.

626
01:01:35,344 --> 01:01:36,904
Oh, fine.

627
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:41,504
Where are you going?

628
01:01:41,584 --> 01:01:43,704
I forgot my earrings.

629
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,624
Make yourself a drink.

630
01:01:45,704 --> 01:01:48,704
There are glasses in the bar.

631
01:01:59,224 --> 01:02:01,344
You know what you're doing?

632
01:02:21,384 --> 01:02:23,584
I like your place, Brenda.

633
01:02:23,704 --> 01:02:27,824
I've been here three months.
Still fixing it up.

634
01:02:31,544 --> 01:02:33,584
Interesting view.

635
01:02:33,664 --> 01:02:35,584
What did you say?

636
01:02:40,384 --> 01:02:42,984
I said, "Interesting view"!

637
01:02:43,064 --> 01:02:44,704
Isn't it great?

638
01:02:50,264 --> 01:02:52,144
You never told me...

639
01:02:52,184 --> 01:02:55,064
what you do
for a living.

640
01:02:55,144 --> 01:02:59,664
I work for
the Metropolitan Museum...

641
01:02:59,744 --> 01:03:02,344
in acquisitions.

642
01:03:02,424 --> 01:03:05,424
Huh. That explains
your interest...

643
01:03:05,504 --> 01:03:07,704
in ancient weapons.

644
01:03:09,624 --> 01:03:10,984
Right.

645
01:03:12,504 --> 01:03:15,384
Especially the samurai.

646
01:03:15,464 --> 01:03:16,904
Very nice.

647
01:03:17,024 --> 01:03:19,224
Shall we have a toast?

648
01:03:19,304 --> 01:03:20,744
Yes.

649
01:03:25,544 --> 01:03:27,464
Brandy.

650
01:03:27,584 --> 01:03:30,064
Bottled in 1783.

651
01:03:30,144 --> 01:03:32,264
Wow. That's old.

652
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,104
1783 was a very good year.

653
01:03:39,464 --> 01:03:41,824
Mozart wrote
his great mass.

654
01:03:41,864 --> 01:03:44,344
The Montgolfier Brothers went up...

655
01:03:44,464 --> 01:03:47,224
in their first balloon.

656
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:50,504
Hah.

657
01:03:50,584 --> 01:03:52,424
And England recognized...

658
01:03:52,504 --> 01:03:55,744
the independence
of the United States.

659
01:03:55,864 --> 01:03:58,144
Is that right?

660
01:03:58,264 --> 01:03:59,504
Yes.

661
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:08,224
What's that?

662
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:10,144
It's for you.

663
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:11,824
Can I open it?

664
01:04:11,864 --> 01:04:13,424
If you like.

665
01:04:27,224 --> 01:04:28,064
You bastard.

666
01:04:28,184 --> 01:04:29,984
Where did you find this?

667
01:04:30,104 --> 01:04:32,104
I have an extensive library.

668
01:04:33,664 --> 01:04:34,864
Odd thing.

669
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:37,184
Your bio doesn't
mention the Met.

670
01:04:37,304 --> 01:04:39,584
It says you work
for the police...

671
01:04:39,704 --> 01:04:41,384
in forensics.

672
01:04:41,424 --> 01:04:43,424
Are you and Moran
setting me up?

673
01:04:43,504 --> 01:04:45,424
I don't work for Moran.

674
01:04:45,544 --> 01:04:47,744
Then why is that bald policeman...

675
01:04:47,824 --> 01:04:50,144
sitting outside
watching your apartment?

676
01:04:51,864 --> 01:04:53,104
You remember him.

677
01:04:53,224 --> 01:04:54,904
Moran's had him tailing me.

678
01:04:54,904 --> 01:04:56,584
What are you going to do?

679
01:04:56,664 --> 01:04:59,144
Question is,
what are you going to do?

680
01:04:59,264 --> 01:05:01,824
Turn off the tape or
shoot me with the.45?

681
01:05:05,304 --> 01:05:07,104
I'm not looking
for a killer.

682
01:05:07,224 --> 01:05:08,544
I'm looking for a sword.

683
01:05:08,664 --> 01:05:10,544
The one used on Fasil.

684
01:05:10,584 --> 01:05:13,264
- I only want to see the samurai.
- Why?

685
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:15,264
Because it's not
supposed to exist.

686
01:05:15,344 --> 01:05:17,384
I dated the blade
at 600 B.C.

687
01:05:17,464 --> 01:05:19,664
The metal had been
folded 200 times.

688
01:05:19,784 --> 01:05:23,024
The Japanese didn't make swords
like that till the Middle Ages.

689
01:05:23,144 --> 01:05:25,184
So where the hell
did it come from?

690
01:05:25,224 --> 01:05:27,424
If I could verify
its existence...

691
01:05:27,464 --> 01:05:29,624
it would be like
discovering a 747...

692
01:05:29,664 --> 01:05:32,544
a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

693
01:05:32,624 --> 01:05:34,944
This is crazy.

694
01:05:35,024 --> 01:05:37,504
Wait a minute, Nash.
I want some answers.

695
01:05:39,344 --> 01:05:41,224
You want?

696
01:05:41,264 --> 01:05:43,544
Don't you ever
think about anything...

697
01:05:43,664 --> 01:05:45,184
except what you want?

698
01:05:58,984 --> 01:06:01,024
You must leave her, brother.

699
01:07:18,424 --> 01:07:19,744
Heather!

700
01:07:36,064 --> 01:07:37,024
Heather!

701
01:07:38,664 --> 01:07:41,344
Connor, I'm here!

702
01:08:01,864 --> 01:08:04,264
My beautiful man.

703
01:08:04,264 --> 01:08:06,144
My husband.

704
01:08:06,184 --> 01:08:09,144
I am that, my love.

705
01:08:12,864 --> 01:08:16,144
I've never really known...

706
01:08:16,224 --> 01:08:17,784
What?

707
01:08:19,384 --> 01:08:21,624
Why you stayed.

708
01:08:22,944 --> 01:08:26,224
Because I love you
as much now...

709
01:08:26,304 --> 01:08:29,104
as the first day we met.

710
01:08:29,184 --> 01:08:31,664
And I love you.

711
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:38,664
I don't want to die.

712
01:08:38,784 --> 01:08:42,984
I want to stay
with you forever.

713
01:08:43,104 --> 01:08:44,904
I want that too.

714
01:08:45,024 --> 01:08:48,464
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

715
01:08:50,744 --> 01:08:52,104
What, lass?

716
01:08:52,184 --> 01:08:55,944
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

717
01:08:56,024 --> 01:08:59,024
and remember me
on my birthday?

718
01:08:59,024 --> 01:09:03,504
Aye, love. I will.

719
01:09:03,624 --> 01:09:07,064
I wanted to have
your children.

720
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:11,184
They would have been
strong and fine.

721
01:09:15,224 --> 01:09:17,744
Don't see me, Connor.

722
01:09:17,784 --> 01:09:20,304
Let me die in peace.

723
01:09:22,784 --> 01:09:24,984
Where are we?

724
01:09:31,024 --> 01:09:33,904
We're in the highlands.

725
01:09:35,744 --> 01:09:37,744
Where else?

726
01:09:40,544 --> 01:09:42,944
Running down a mountainside.

727
01:09:56,344 --> 01:09:58,464
The sun is shining.

728
01:09:59,704 --> 01:10:01,264
It's not cold.

729
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:05,944
You've got your sheepskins on...

730
01:10:08,064 --> 01:10:11,624
and the boots
I made for you.

731
01:10:14,984 --> 01:10:17,384
Good night,
my bonny Heather.

732
01:10:31,944 --> 01:10:34,424
Hey! Kastagir.

733
01:10:35,304 --> 01:10:38,664
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

734
01:10:38,704 --> 01:10:41,344
It seems like 100 years.

735
01:10:41,384 --> 01:10:44,024
It's been 100 years.

736
01:10:51,424 --> 01:10:53,344
How have you been?

737
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:57,344
Hey, this...

738
01:10:57,464 --> 01:11:01,104
puts hairs on your chest.

739
01:11:03,584 --> 01:11:04,984
What is it?

740
01:11:05,024 --> 01:11:06,344
Boom-boom.

741
01:11:06,384 --> 01:11:07,864
Big strong man like you...

742
01:11:07,904 --> 01:11:10,504
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

743
01:11:10,584 --> 01:11:13,584
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

744
01:11:13,664 --> 01:11:15,304
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

745
01:11:16,744 --> 01:11:20,584
So...
the gathering is here.

746
01:11:20,664 --> 01:11:22,464
Ahh.

747
01:11:22,504 --> 01:11:24,584
Time's almost
caught us, friend.

748
01:11:24,704 --> 01:11:27,464
Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

749
01:11:29,664 --> 01:11:31,984
I think we should
have a party.

750
01:11:32,064 --> 01:11:35,064
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

751
01:11:35,144 --> 01:11:36,104
Really?

752
01:11:36,184 --> 01:11:37,624
When exactly was that?

753
01:11:37,664 --> 01:11:39,464
It was 1783.

754
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:42,064
1783.

755
01:11:42,144 --> 01:11:43,504
Oh, yes.

756
01:11:43,584 --> 01:11:45,904
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

757
01:11:45,984 --> 01:11:47,304
Ha ha ha!
You were drunk.

758
01:11:47,424 --> 01:11:49,704
What was that guy's name again?

759
01:11:49,824 --> 01:11:51,224
His name was Bassett.

760
01:11:51,264 --> 01:11:52,584
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

761
01:11:52,704 --> 01:11:53,544
I implore you.

762
01:11:53,664 --> 01:11:57,024
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.

763
01:11:57,104 --> 01:11:59,304
See if the imbecile is ready.

764
01:11:59,424 --> 01:12:01,704
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

765
01:12:01,744 --> 01:12:03,544
Tell him I'm ready.

766
01:12:03,624 --> 01:12:06,224
Christ! I've gone blind.

767
01:12:07,184 --> 01:12:08,984
En garde, sir.

768
01:12:11,504 --> 01:12:13,904
Wonderful, sir.

769
01:12:13,984 --> 01:12:15,704
Thank you, Hotchkiss.

770
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:17,424
Bassett?

771
01:12:17,544 --> 01:12:19,624
That you?

772
01:12:19,744 --> 01:12:21,744
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

773
01:12:28,264 --> 01:12:30,304
The sword, the sword.

774
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:43,344
Stop, sir.

775
01:12:43,344 --> 01:12:45,264
I beseech you.

776
01:12:45,344 --> 01:12:48,024
I apologize for
calling your wife...

777
01:12:48,144 --> 01:12:50,424
a bloated warthog...

778
01:12:50,504 --> 01:12:53,384
And I bid you good day.

779
01:12:55,224 --> 01:12:56,584
Shoot him, sir.

780
01:12:56,584 --> 01:12:57,424
Shoot him.

781
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,544
Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!

782
01:12:59,624 --> 01:13:02,504
Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss!
Stop it!

783
01:13:03,664 --> 01:13:05,664
* Hotchkiss *

784
01:13:05,784 --> 01:13:06,664
What?

785
01:13:06,704 --> 01:13:07,584
No, sir.

786
01:13:07,704 --> 01:13:09,984
No, no...

787
01:13:10,104 --> 01:13:12,024
No! No! No!

788
01:13:15,944 --> 01:13:18,824
That's the mood
of New York now.

789
01:13:18,904 --> 01:13:20,744
Get out of here!

790
01:13:20,824 --> 01:13:22,064
So far...

791
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:31,104
Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure...

792
01:13:31,184 --> 01:13:33,504
the mayor's office issued
the following statement...

793
01:13:33,584 --> 01:13:35,024
Give us a drink, pal.

794
01:13:35,104 --> 01:13:37,424
Got a joint?

795
01:13:37,504 --> 01:13:38,824
...vigorous investigation...

796
01:13:38,864 --> 01:13:41,984
following up on
some promising leads.

797
01:13:42,024 --> 01:13:45,384
Hey, Rockefeller,
how'd you like Candy?

798
01:13:45,384 --> 01:13:48,744
She said you were
kind of kinky, huh?

799
01:13:48,824 --> 01:13:51,904
Don't ever speak to me.

800
01:13:53,824 --> 01:13:56,104
I didn't mean nothin'.

801
01:13:56,224 --> 01:13:58,144
Look, I didn't mean...

802
01:14:00,344 --> 01:14:04,464
Don't ever speak
to me again.

803
01:14:04,544 --> 01:14:06,584
Do you understand?

804
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:08,504
Yeah.

805
01:14:08,584 --> 01:14:10,984
Good.

806
01:14:13,464 --> 01:14:17,784
I hope you get your head
chopped off, asshole.

807
01:14:20,104 --> 01:14:21,424
And you!

808
01:14:21,464 --> 01:14:22,784
Shut it!

809
01:14:44,344 --> 01:14:46,864
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

810
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:55,864
What the hell?

811
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,784
Okay, marine,
this is for real!

812
01:15:15,904 --> 01:15:17,344
Yah!

813
01:15:17,464 --> 01:15:18,424
Let's go!

814
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:24,824
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

815
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:39,304
What the hell
is going on?

816
01:15:51,784 --> 01:15:52,824
Ahh!

817
01:16:05,784 --> 01:16:08,464
Is somebody trapped
in there?

818
01:17:28,264 --> 01:17:29,144
For God's sake!

819
01:17:41,304 --> 01:17:42,664
Look at that!

820
01:18:18,704 --> 01:18:20,624
Mother of God.

821
01:18:24,944 --> 01:18:26,104
Mom.

822
01:18:26,184 --> 01:18:27,144
Boo!

823
01:18:30,424 --> 01:18:33,784
Hey, where are you
going with my car?

824
01:18:33,864 --> 01:18:36,944
Daddy, help me! Daddy!
Daddy, help me!

825
01:18:37,024 --> 01:18:37,904
Help, Daddy!

826
01:18:37,984 --> 01:18:39,624
Daddy, help me!

827
01:18:44,904 --> 01:18:46,704
Frank, take it easy.

828
01:18:46,824 --> 01:18:48,704
I checked everywhere.

829
01:18:48,744 --> 01:18:51,024
There aren't any witnesses.

830
01:18:51,064 --> 01:18:53,344
That's New York for you.

831
01:18:53,424 --> 01:18:55,824
Twenty people standing around.
Nobody saw a thing.

832
01:18:55,904 --> 01:18:58,584
Tell me about Matunas.
Is he on drugs?

833
01:18:58,704 --> 01:19:00,024
He's a survival nut.

834
01:19:00,144 --> 01:19:01,464
What?

835
01:19:01,584 --> 01:19:03,384
He was a marine.

836
01:19:03,504 --> 01:19:06,264
His ex-c. o. said
he was paranoid...

837
01:19:06,304 --> 01:19:09,144
but he was a good man.

838
01:19:09,264 --> 01:19:11,064
How you doing, kid?

839
01:19:11,184 --> 01:19:13,664
Okay, for a guy who got three feet
of steel crammed through his gut.

840
01:19:13,704 --> 01:19:15,104
How you doing?

841
01:19:15,184 --> 01:19:18,744
I understand
you saw who stuck you?

842
01:19:18,944 --> 01:19:20,584
You kidding me, man?

843
01:19:20,584 --> 01:19:22,184
Is that him?

844
01:19:22,304 --> 01:19:23,424
Nope.

845
01:19:23,544 --> 01:19:26,224
Quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley.

846
01:19:26,304 --> 01:19:28,624
The freak was trying to kill me!

847
01:19:28,704 --> 01:19:31,984
He had a scar
across his neck.

848
01:19:32,064 --> 01:19:33,904
That ain't him.

849
01:19:33,984 --> 01:19:35,544
Shit.

850
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:39,264
Depressed?

851
01:19:39,304 --> 01:19:40,704
Yeah.

852
01:19:40,784 --> 01:19:43,784
You don't know grunt
about depressed.

853
01:19:43,784 --> 01:19:46,064
I got me a.357.

854
01:19:46,184 --> 01:19:48,464
Got me a trunk load
of shotguns.

855
01:19:48,584 --> 01:19:50,584
I got three big-bore
battle rifles...

856
01:19:50,664 --> 01:19:51,624
ammo up the ass...

857
01:19:51,744 --> 01:19:53,464
and I ain't safe!

858
01:19:53,544 --> 01:19:55,264
I can't protect myself!

859
01:19:55,304 --> 01:19:57,024
Okay, take it easy, pal.

860
01:19:57,024 --> 01:19:58,824
That weirdo, man.

861
01:19:58,944 --> 01:20:01,904
He got up after I put
enough lead in him...

862
01:20:01,944 --> 01:20:03,304
to drop a rhino.

863
01:20:03,344 --> 01:20:05,544
Hey, listen,
could you work...

864
01:20:05,624 --> 01:20:07,544
with one of our artists?

865
01:20:07,664 --> 01:20:09,944
Get a picture of this guy?

866
01:20:10,064 --> 01:20:12,064
Sure, sure.

867
01:20:12,144 --> 01:20:15,144
Thanks.
Take it easy, pal.

868
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:16,584
Hey, cop.

869
01:20:16,664 --> 01:20:17,624
Yeah.

870
01:20:17,744 --> 01:20:20,304
I know you guys
think I'm nuts...

871
01:20:20,424 --> 01:20:23,304
but there's something else
I gotta tell you.

872
01:20:23,384 --> 01:20:26,624
After he threw me
against the wall...

873
01:20:45,344 --> 01:20:47,064
This is like
"One Step Beyond".

874
01:20:47,184 --> 01:20:49,624
All we got is an eyewitness.

875
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,864
Don't say anything
about sword fights...

876
01:20:51,944 --> 01:20:53,864
or guys glowing in the dark
for Christ's sake.

877
01:20:55,424 --> 01:20:56,864
Hey, Moran!

878
01:20:56,944 --> 01:20:58,784
Have you read this?

879
01:20:58,864 --> 01:21:02,784
Are you kidding?
You know cops can't read.

880
01:21:02,904 --> 01:21:05,584
What does "incompetent" mean?

881
01:21:05,624 --> 01:21:06,984
That mayor.

882
01:21:07,024 --> 01:21:10,864
He calls me at 2:00
in the morning.

883
01:21:10,944 --> 01:21:13,744
I don't answer
the phone anymore.

884
01:21:13,744 --> 01:21:16,424
What does "baffled" mean?

885
01:21:46,344 --> 01:21:49,664
Karen Joan Nash.

886
01:21:49,704 --> 01:21:52,544
Yeah, I remember her.

887
01:21:52,584 --> 01:21:54,984
I was practicing
in Syracuse.

888
01:21:54,984 --> 01:21:57,384
Didn't get many of these.

889
01:21:57,384 --> 01:21:58,784
What?

890
01:21:58,824 --> 01:22:00,224
Unwed mothers.

891
01:22:00,264 --> 01:22:02,744
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

892
01:22:02,824 --> 01:22:05,704
Back then, in Syracuse...

893
01:22:05,824 --> 01:22:08,384
that was a stoning offense.

894
01:22:08,504 --> 01:22:09,944
What happened?

895
01:22:10,024 --> 01:22:13,104
She had the baby,
and she died.

896
01:22:13,184 --> 01:22:14,544
So Nash was illegitimate.

897
01:22:14,624 --> 01:22:17,144
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he was illegitimate...

898
01:22:17,224 --> 01:22:19,504
for about a minute and a half.

899
01:22:19,624 --> 01:22:21,824
He died right after she did.

900
01:22:25,944 --> 01:22:27,664
He died.

901
01:22:37,664 --> 01:22:38,504
Hello, Brenda.

902
01:22:38,624 --> 01:22:40,424
I did what you asked.

903
01:22:40,544 --> 01:22:44,184
I went through the deeds
to Nash's house...

904
01:22:44,264 --> 01:22:46,904
back through
five previous owners...

905
01:22:46,944 --> 01:22:49,544
to the original guy,
Montague, in 1796.

906
01:22:49,624 --> 01:22:50,824
In all five instances...

907
01:22:50,864 --> 01:22:52,024
Montague through Nash...

908
01:22:52,144 --> 01:22:53,464
I found a death certificate...

909
01:22:53,584 --> 01:22:55,584
for a kid with the same name...

910
01:22:55,624 --> 01:22:57,024
who died at birth...

911
01:22:57,104 --> 01:23:00,464
years before he pretended to sign
for his inheritance.

912
01:23:00,584 --> 01:23:03,624
Jesus, Rick, isn't there
any heat in here?

913
01:23:03,744 --> 01:23:06,304
No. Heat's bad
for the circuits.

914
01:23:06,424 --> 01:23:08,824
In case
there's any doubt...

915
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,304
So, what you've
got here, Brenda...

916
01:23:30,384 --> 01:23:33,264
is a guy who's been
creeping around...

917
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:34,864
since at least 1700...

918
01:23:34,904 --> 01:23:37,304
pretending to croak
every so often.

919
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,704
Leaving all his goods...

920
01:23:38,744 --> 01:23:41,144
to kids who've been
corpses for years...

921
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:43,544
and assuming
their identities.

922
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:52,664
It's not possible.

923
01:23:52,744 --> 01:23:54,064
"Post" final!

924
01:23:54,184 --> 01:23:56,384
Cops release
headhunter picture!

925
01:23:56,424 --> 01:23:57,584
Reward offered.

926
01:23:57,624 --> 01:23:58,784
I'll take a "Post".

927
01:23:58,864 --> 01:24:00,424
Headhunter revealed!

928
01:24:32,744 --> 01:24:35,984
For you, my bonny Heather.

929
01:24:36,104 --> 01:24:38,024
Happy birthday.

930
01:24:39,944 --> 01:24:43,664
And you, Juan Ramirez.

931
01:24:43,744 --> 01:24:47,224
Take care of her,
you overdressed haggis.

932
01:25:22,104 --> 01:25:24,504
Kastagir is gone.

933
01:25:24,624 --> 01:25:26,904
Only you and I remain.

934
01:25:34,024 --> 01:25:36,904
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

935
01:25:36,984 --> 01:25:38,984
Who cuts your hair?

936
01:25:39,104 --> 01:25:42,184
I am in disguise.

937
01:25:42,264 --> 01:25:45,904
This way no one
will recognize me.

938
01:25:48,224 --> 01:25:49,464
I do.

939
01:25:50,904 --> 01:25:52,824
What do you want?

940
01:25:52,904 --> 01:25:55,104
Your head.

941
01:25:55,224 --> 01:25:57,024
And the prize.

942
01:25:57,984 --> 01:26:01,224
Watch.

943
01:26:01,264 --> 01:26:04,144
Happy Halloween, ladies!

944
01:26:04,224 --> 01:26:06,344
Blah, blah.

945
01:26:06,424 --> 01:26:07,864
Blah.

946
01:26:07,984 --> 01:26:10,664
Blah, blah, blah.

947
01:26:12,744 --> 01:26:15,344
Nuns. No sense of humor.

948
01:26:15,464 --> 01:26:19,584
Ramirez's blade did not
cut deeply enough.

949
01:26:19,664 --> 01:26:23,104
He was right about you.
You're slime.

950
01:26:23,224 --> 01:26:25,344
Ramirez was an effete snob!

951
01:26:25,424 --> 01:26:27,704
He died on his knees!

952
01:26:27,824 --> 01:26:31,544
I took his head
and raped his woman...

953
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:34,824
before his blood
was even cold!

954
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:44,504
I see.

955
01:26:44,584 --> 01:26:47,584
Ramirez lied.

956
01:26:49,864 --> 01:26:52,664
She was not his woman.

957
01:26:52,744 --> 01:26:54,784
She was your woman...

958
01:26:54,864 --> 01:26:58,504
and she never told you.

959
01:26:58,544 --> 01:27:00,904
I wonder why.

960
01:27:00,984 --> 01:27:03,304
Perhaps I gave her something...

961
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:05,704
you never could...

962
01:27:07,704 --> 01:27:11,944
and secretly she yearned
for my return.

963
01:27:11,944 --> 01:27:14,784
Holy ground, Highlander!

964
01:27:14,824 --> 01:27:17,504
Remember what
Ramirez taught you.

965
01:27:21,144 --> 01:27:24,504
You can't stay
in here forever.

966
01:27:27,104 --> 01:27:29,144
You are weak, Highlander.

967
01:27:29,184 --> 01:27:34,864
You will always be
weaker than I.

968
01:27:38,504 --> 01:27:40,424
I'll be out front.

969
01:27:44,744 --> 01:27:46,344
Goodbye, Macleod.

970
01:27:46,464 --> 01:27:50,104
We will meet soon enough.

971
01:27:59,424 --> 01:28:01,864
This is the house of God.

972
01:28:01,864 --> 01:28:04,304
People are trying to pray.

973
01:28:04,384 --> 01:28:05,824
You're disturbing them.

974
01:28:07,544 --> 01:28:11,784
He cares about
these helpless mortals?

975
01:28:11,864 --> 01:28:13,704
Of course he cares.

976
01:28:13,784 --> 01:28:16,104
He died for our sins.

977
01:28:16,184 --> 01:28:18,504
That shall be his undoing.

978
01:28:20,424 --> 01:28:22,824
Father...

979
01:28:22,904 --> 01:28:24,744
forgive me!

980
01:28:24,824 --> 01:28:27,704
I am a worm.

981
01:28:39,784 --> 01:28:42,384
I have something to say!

982
01:28:42,464 --> 01:28:44,584
It's better to burn out...

983
01:28:44,624 --> 01:28:47,264
than to fade away!

984
01:28:54,944 --> 01:28:56,664
I need to see him, goddamn it!

985
01:28:56,744 --> 01:28:58,584
I'm afraid that's impossible.

986
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,384
Mr. Nash is...

987
01:29:00,504 --> 01:29:02,144
Mr. Nash is dead.

988
01:29:03,664 --> 01:29:06,544
What are you doing here?

989
01:29:06,624 --> 01:29:08,944
I'm looking for
a dead guy named Nash.

990
01:29:08,984 --> 01:29:11,224
He died at birth
in Syracuse, New York.

991
01:29:15,744 --> 01:29:17,984
All right.

992
01:29:18,024 --> 01:29:20,264
Come on.

993
01:29:46,144 --> 01:29:48,144
Are the Claymores real?

994
01:29:49,504 --> 01:29:50,944
What is this, a museum?

995
01:29:51,024 --> 01:29:53,424
This stuff
must be worth a fortune.

996
01:30:01,984 --> 01:30:05,424
I've been alive
for 41/2 centuries.

997
01:30:05,504 --> 01:30:07,264
I cannot die.

998
01:30:07,344 --> 01:30:09,464
Huh.

999
01:30:09,544 --> 01:30:12,024
Well, everybody's
got their problems.

1000
01:30:16,744 --> 01:30:20,384
What are you going
to do with that?

1001
01:30:20,464 --> 01:30:21,904
Take it.

1002
01:30:34,864 --> 01:30:38,904
I am Connor Macleod
of the Clan Macleod.

1003
01:30:38,984 --> 01:30:41,064
I was born in 1518...

1004
01:30:41,104 --> 01:30:43,264
in the village of Glenfinnan...

1005
01:30:43,304 --> 01:30:45,424
on the shores of Loch Shiel...

1006
01:30:45,464 --> 01:30:47,624
and I am immortal.

1007
01:32:23,224 --> 01:32:24,584
You're not listening.

1008
01:32:24,664 --> 01:32:26,544
Brenda, it isn't going to work.

1009
01:32:26,584 --> 01:32:28,424
I can't get involved.
Not again.

1010
01:32:40,704 --> 01:32:42,584
You know what's weird?

1011
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,504
Most people are
afraid to die.

1012
01:32:45,504 --> 01:32:47,904
That's not your problem.

1013
01:32:48,744 --> 01:32:50,264
You're afraid to live.

1014
01:32:55,184 --> 01:32:57,464
Take care of yourself.

1015
01:32:57,584 --> 01:32:59,104
Don't lose your head.

1016
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:16,544
Hello, pretty.

1017
01:33:20,384 --> 01:33:23,544
Come on!
Open up!

1018
01:33:29,784 --> 01:33:32,184
Oh, my!

1019
01:33:53,584 --> 01:33:55,024
Have you ever
played chicken?

1020
01:33:59,624 --> 01:34:01,344
Here we go!

1021
01:34:03,824 --> 01:34:05,744
Watch out!

1022
01:34:40,104 --> 01:34:42,024
Excuse me!

1023
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,944
Oh, no!

1024
01:35:03,304 --> 01:35:05,584
Watch out! A truck!

1025
01:35:05,704 --> 01:35:07,624
Look out!

1026
01:35:29,664 --> 01:35:30,544
Shut up.

1027
01:35:32,664 --> 01:35:34,264
Sing along...

1028
01:35:34,384 --> 01:35:36,504
Shut up!

1029
01:35:42,224 --> 01:35:43,584
Shut up!

1030
01:35:44,744 --> 01:35:47,144
Shut up!

1031
01:36:22,624 --> 01:36:24,904
I can entertain myself.

1032
01:36:25,024 --> 01:36:27,504
Your friend is a real screamer.
Listen.

1033
01:36:28,744 --> 01:36:31,904
Which part should
I cut off first?

1034
01:36:32,024 --> 01:36:33,944
I'll be waiting.

1035
01:36:39,584 --> 01:36:42,424
The endless killing
has driven him mad.

1036
01:36:42,464 --> 01:36:44,864
Rachel, there are instructions
in the desk drawer.

1037
01:36:44,904 --> 01:36:46,744
I want you to follow them.

1038
01:36:46,784 --> 01:36:49,184
There's a power of attorney
for you.

1039
01:36:49,224 --> 01:36:51,664
You'll have everything you need.

1040
01:36:51,784 --> 01:36:53,504
You're not coming back.

1041
01:36:54,464 --> 01:36:56,384
Even if you kill him...

1042
01:36:56,384 --> 01:36:58,304
you're not coming back...

1043
01:36:58,304 --> 01:36:59,544
are you?

1044
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:09,704
Sweet Rachel.

1045
01:37:09,784 --> 01:37:13,424
You always knew
this would happen.

1046
01:37:13,544 --> 01:37:15,744
Russell Nash dies tonight.

1047
01:37:30,144 --> 01:37:33,504
Hey...
it's a kind of magic.

1048
01:37:41,744 --> 01:37:43,944
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

1049
01:42:49,024 --> 01:42:51,424
So now it ends.

1050
01:43:08,864 --> 01:43:10,304
What kept you?

1051
01:45:20,064 --> 01:45:22,544
There can be only one!

1052
01:45:54,024 --> 01:45:56,904
The quickening overpowers me!

1053
01:46:00,624 --> 01:46:03,504
I know!
I know everything!

1054
01:46:03,704 --> 01:46:05,824
I am everything!

1055
01:47:03,544 --> 01:47:06,144
this is where it all began.

1056
01:47:06,224 --> 01:47:09,064
Can you tell me
about the prize?

1057
01:47:09,104 --> 01:47:11,904
It's like a whirlwind
in my head.

1058
01:47:11,904 --> 01:47:13,224
But if I concentrate...

1059
01:47:13,304 --> 01:47:15,144
I know what people
are thinking...

1060
01:47:15,224 --> 01:47:16,784
all over the world.

1061
01:47:16,824 --> 01:47:17,944
Presidents...

1062
01:47:18,024 --> 01:47:19,064
diplomats...

1063
01:47:19,184 --> 01:47:20,704
scientists.

1064
01:47:20,784 --> 01:47:23,584
I can help them
understand each other.

1065
01:47:24,624 --> 01:47:25,904
What am I thinking?

1066
01:47:25,984 --> 01:47:26,864
You're thinking...

1067
01:47:26,944 --> 01:47:29,704
whether or not
you can love me.

1068
01:47:29,824 --> 01:47:31,624
You can.
I'm just like you.

1069
01:47:31,744 --> 01:47:33,544
I can love and
have children.

1070
01:47:33,664 --> 01:47:35,384
Live and grow old.

1071
01:47:35,464 --> 01:47:37,864
You never prepared
me for that...

1072
01:47:37,904 --> 01:47:39,224
you Spanish peacock.

1073
01:47:40,944 --> 01:47:42,944
Patience, Highlander.

1074
01:47:43,064 --> 01:47:45,264
You have done well.

1075
01:47:45,344 --> 01:47:47,384
But it'll take time.

1076
01:47:47,464 --> 01:47:52,544
You are generations
being born and dying.

1077
01:47:52,624 --> 01:47:54,944
You are at one
with all living things.

1078
01:47:55,024 --> 01:47:58,224
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

1079
01:47:59,824 --> 01:48:02,624
You have power beyond imagination.

1080
01:48:02,704 --> 01:48:05,304
Use it well, my friend.

1081
01:48:05,384 --> 01:48:07,424
Don't lose your head.
