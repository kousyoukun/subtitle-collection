1
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:31,917
... and Tonga Kid! Your opponents,

2
00:02:32,334 --> 00:02:33,626
over on my right,

3
00:02:34,042 --> 00:02:38,917
with a combined weight of 725 lbs:

4
00:02:39,334 --> 00:02:45,376
"The Toast from the Coast"
from Atlanta, Georgia,

5
00:02:45,792 --> 00:02:48,917
the "Fabulous Freebirds!"

6
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:00,209
Yeah, right! You're gonna love it!

7
00:04:22,209 --> 00:04:24,209
Kill him! Stamp out the sonofa...

8
00:04:41,292 --> 00:04:44,709
Don't give them a chance!

9
00:04:46,251 --> 00:04:48,584
Hey, where are you going?

10
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,667
MacLeod!

11
00:06:00,876 --> 00:06:01,876
Fasil...

12
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:03,751
Wait.

13
00:06:24,334 --> 00:06:25,667
Alright...

14
00:11:31,292 --> 00:11:32,917
MacLeod!

15
00:11:47,751 --> 00:11:51,167
May this year of our Lord 1536

16
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:54,501
bring victory to the clan MacLeod!

17
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:58,334
MacLeod! Victory to MacLeod!

18
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:17,667
Are you scared, Connor?
- No, cousin Dougal, I'm not.

19
00:12:18,084 --> 00:12:19,917
Don't talk nonsense!

20
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:23,751
I peed my kilt
the first time I went into battle!

21
00:12:24,167 --> 00:12:28,001
Ay, Angus pees his kilt all the time.

22
00:12:48,376 --> 00:12:49,334
Connor!

23
00:12:50,584 --> 00:12:51,626
Connor!

24
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,584
Wait!

25
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:58,917
Take these flowers and think of me.

26
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:04,959
You fight with God on your side.

27
00:13:05,376 --> 00:13:09,334
Ay, a girl like that can wound
a soldier more than a Fraser's sword.

28
00:13:09,751 --> 00:13:12,001
Keep him in one piece!

29
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:15,167
Ay... We all know
which piece that is!

30
00:13:59,542 --> 00:14:03,251
There is one called Connor among them.
- Ay.

31
00:14:08,917 --> 00:14:12,376
Remember our agreement, Murdoch:

32
00:14:12,792 --> 00:14:15,042
The boy is mine.

33
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:17,792
It's begun.

34
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:20,334
Death to the MacLeods!

35
00:14:55,792 --> 00:14:57,251
MacLeod!

36
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:14,292
Come on!

37
00:15:14,667 --> 00:15:16,167
Macleod!

38
00:15:20,584 --> 00:15:22,209
Stay under!

39
00:15:23,709 --> 00:15:25,209
Forgive me,

40
00:15:25,626 --> 00:15:27,292
my son.

41
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:30,417
Fight me, damn you!

42
00:15:30,834 --> 00:15:34,084
No, that's Connor MacLeod!
- Fight me, you cowards!

43
00:15:42,167 --> 00:15:43,751
Death to the heathens!

44
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,001
Nobody will fight me!

45
00:15:47,626 --> 00:15:48,584
They all run away.

46
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,084
Stay by me.

47
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:00,251
Holy Mother of God!

48
00:16:05,251 --> 00:16:06,751
Fight me!

49
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:21,626
No!

50
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:24,334
Come on, quick!

51
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,626
There can be only one!

52
00:16:30,417 --> 00:16:31,751
Another time, MacLeod!

53
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:09,709
Get out! Put your hands on the hood!

54
00:17:12,584 --> 00:17:13,876
Move!

55
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:19,126
Watch it, freak!

56
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:21,084
Just cool it!

57
00:17:29,042 --> 00:17:31,209
Spread them; come on!

58
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,876
See some ID!

59
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:39,751
Well, Mr. Nash, where were you going

60
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,751
in such a hurry?

61
00:17:44,626 --> 00:17:46,751
Give me it!

62
00:17:53,084 --> 00:17:55,376
Don't move, pal!

63
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:58,042
Don't even breathe.

64
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:49,001
It is over.
- No!

65
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:53,751
Other men are dying this day.
I must attend them.

66
00:18:55,251 --> 00:18:56,376
Quiet!

67
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:04,834
He's a Highlander!

68
00:19:05,251 --> 00:19:09,167
The last thing to hear
should not be that of a wailing woman!

69
00:19:34,292 --> 00:19:36,126
Let me through.

70
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:39,251
Damn it, forensics are supposed
to be notified the same time

71
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:41,917
as homicide!

72
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:43,376
Holy shit!

73
00:19:43,876 --> 00:19:46,834
Yeah, this one came to assemble.
- Have you made any arrests?

74
00:19:47,209 --> 00:19:52,376
No. We're questioning some
antique dealer down on Hudson Street.

75
00:19:52,834 --> 00:19:54,876
Hello, Brenda.
- Hello.

76
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,376
You look pretty, Brenda.

77
00:19:57,751 --> 00:20:00,751
What do you think is
the cause of death, Lieutenant?

78
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:04,167
Very funny, Garfield.

79
00:20:04,542 --> 00:20:09,209
Get your hands off! - Hey, cop!
I got friends, my wife, man!

80
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:12,209
Walker, get me a Danish toast, please!

81
00:20:12,626 --> 00:20:17,001
What did they say? What time did he
buy it? - About ten, ten-thirty.

82
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,084
The weapon was razor sharp.

83
00:20:25,376 --> 00:20:27,167
Oh my God!

84
00:20:27,584 --> 00:20:32,959
A guy was killed just like this in
New Jersey. - Yeah, in New Jersey...

85
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:38,042
Hey Frank, come here!

86
00:20:39,876 --> 00:20:41,417
Oh shit!

87
00:20:43,584 --> 00:20:46,042
Baby, look at you...

88
00:20:47,084 --> 00:20:49,417
Garfield, cover that head.

89
00:20:55,126 --> 00:20:58,876
What the hell have you got?
- A Toledo Salamanca.

90
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:03,501
A what?
- A sword, Frank. A very rare sword.

91
00:21:04,542 --> 00:21:07,792
Is it worth much?
- About a million bucks.

92
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:14,501
Any antique dealer
on Hudson Street could tell you that.

93
00:21:50,626 --> 00:21:53,626
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

94
00:21:54,709 --> 00:22:00,251
The name's Vasilek. Polish national.
Had his head cut off in New Jersey.

95
00:22:00,667 --> 00:22:03,667
You ever get over to New Jersey?
- Not really.

96
00:22:04,084 --> 00:22:08,042
You talk funny, Nash. Where you from?
- Lots of different places.

97
00:22:08,584 --> 00:22:11,167
You're an antique dealer, right?
- Yeah.

98
00:22:11,584 --> 00:22:13,792
Okay... What's that?

99
00:22:19,209 --> 00:22:22,001
A sword?
- Wise up, smart ass!

100
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:29,126
That's a Toledo Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million dollars. - So?

101
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:34,459
So, you want to hear my theory? You
wanted to buy the sword from that guy.

102
00:22:34,876 --> 00:22:37,417
What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

103
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:42,459
Iman Fasil. You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

104
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,459
You want to hear another theory?

105
00:22:46,876 --> 00:22:50,751
This Fasil was so upset
about the lousy wrestling tonight,

106
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:55,042
that in a fit of depression
he cut off his own head.

107
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:58,167
That's not funny, Walt.

108
00:22:59,001 --> 00:23:03,126
Are you a faggot, Nash? - Why?
Are you cruisin' for a piece of ass?

109
00:23:05,376 --> 00:23:07,417
I'll tell you what happened.

110
00:23:07,834 --> 00:23:12,167
You went down to the garage
for a blow job without paying for it.

111
00:23:12,917 --> 00:23:15,126
You are sick.

112
00:23:21,209 --> 00:23:22,167
Hey!

113
00:23:24,126 --> 00:23:27,917
That's enough!
Damn it! I said cut it out!

114
00:23:28,334 --> 00:23:29,959
I said cut it out!

115
00:23:31,959 --> 00:23:34,209
Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

116
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:38,459
Then we're through.
- Nash, we're just getting started!

117
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:43,751
... Garage and water from a sprinkler.

118
00:23:44,167 --> 00:23:48,959
It also left a man's decapitated body

119
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:52,292
lying next to his own severed head.

120
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:56,834
A head, which this time has no name.
- I know his name...

121
00:24:30,126 --> 00:24:34,126
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruge, room 315,

122
00:24:35,126 --> 00:24:38,042
and I'm going to hit you
for twenty in advance.

123
00:24:45,792 --> 00:24:50,709
If there's anything you need...
broads or blow... just dial 0.

124
00:24:51,209 --> 00:24:56,042
That's right, Mr. Kruger.
You're right here, ain't he?

125
00:24:56,459 --> 00:24:59,959
Don't talk to the guests!
- I didn't do nothin'!

126
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:53,792
At last!

127
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:55,876
The Gathering!

128
00:26:00,042 --> 00:26:01,292
Hi!

129
00:26:01,709 --> 00:26:02,751
I'm Candy.

130
00:26:06,584 --> 00:26:08,584
Of course you are.

131
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,084
Come in!

132
00:26:22,626 --> 00:26:25,584
Got a present for you.
- What's that?

133
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,917
Pieces of metal. Found'em
on the dead guy under the Garden.

134
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,751
In the wound and on the clothes.

135
00:26:32,459 --> 00:26:34,542
Real smooth shave.

136
00:26:51,542 --> 00:26:52,834
That can't be right.

137
00:26:58,459 --> 00:26:59,917
Son of a bitch...

138
00:27:58,917 --> 00:28:00,084
Who's there?

139
00:28:18,376 --> 00:28:22,167
Hey, Brenda. The usual?
- Lots of it.

140
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,417
Say when.

141
00:28:32,834 --> 00:28:34,001
When.

142
00:28:37,042 --> 00:28:39,501
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

143
00:28:39,917 --> 00:28:44,542
A double Glenmorangie on the rocks
- Glenmorangie? - Right.

144
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,751
Go to the Garden often?
- What did you say?

145
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:01,417
What did you say?

146
00:29:03,376 --> 00:29:05,667
Madison Square Garden.

147
00:29:08,042 --> 00:29:09,626
Do you go there often?

148
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,126
Why?

149
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,209
Basketball,

150
00:29:14,626 --> 00:29:16,376
the circus, wrestling...

151
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:19,709
Why are you asking me about it?
Have you been following me?

152
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,959
I'd like to walk you home, Brenda.

153
00:29:31,917 --> 00:29:34,292
I can take care of myself.

154
00:30:48,584 --> 00:30:50,001
Be quiet.

155
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:08,626
Here, take this.

156
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:42,209
Nice to see you again.

157
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,292
Nice yourself.

158
00:31:47,126 --> 00:31:50,001
Stop!
- I'm the only one!

159
00:31:53,959 --> 00:31:55,167
No!

160
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,584
Hey, you, this is the police!

161
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,126
Put down your weapons
and put your hands on your heads.

162
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:09,959
Another time, Highlander.
I will find you.

163
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:14,376
Hold it right there! Come back here!

164
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:20,417
Stop, wait a minute!

165
00:32:20,834 --> 00:32:25,501
Who in the name of God was that?
What did he mean, "the only one?"

166
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:29,792
Listen, lady, you almost...
- I want to know... - Shut up!

167
00:32:30,709 --> 00:32:32,751
Don't you ever follow me again.

168
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:36,376
You only have one life.
If you value it,

169
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:38,542
go home.

170
00:32:51,417 --> 00:32:53,501
You saw the wound, Angus.

171
00:32:54,376 --> 00:32:57,501
He should have died.
- I say he's got the devil in him!

172
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:20,959
Drinking with us, are you?

173
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:25,001
What's the matter, Dougal?
- You talking and breathing.

174
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,126
Last night all but a corpse.

175
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:31,167
How did you manage that, Connor?
- Would you rather I was dead?

176
00:33:31,584 --> 00:33:34,001
It's not natural.

177
00:33:36,917 --> 00:33:38,542
He's in league with Lucifer.

178
00:33:39,459 --> 00:33:41,292
Don't say that, Kate!

179
00:33:41,709 --> 00:33:45,834
I'll say it! You've the devil in you.

180
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,001
We've been kinsmen 20 years!

181
00:33:49,751 --> 00:33:54,834
Connor MacLeod was my kinsman.
I don't know who you are.

182
00:34:01,334 --> 00:34:03,709
Angus...
- You'd better go, Connor.

183
00:34:06,501 --> 00:34:08,584
I'm not going anywhere.

184
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,834
Kill him!

185
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:34,876
Dougal!

186
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:39,167
Dougal, kill him!

187
00:34:40,834 --> 00:34:42,667
He's your cousin!

188
00:34:51,501 --> 00:34:52,792
No, Angus!

189
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:55,876
Quiet!

190
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,709
There'll be no burning today.

191
00:35:00,251 --> 00:35:01,917
We'll banish him.

192
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:04,917
No! Burn him!

193
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:10,667
Burn him!

194
00:35:11,084 --> 00:35:13,959
Can you walk?
- I'll bloody well walk out of here.

195
00:35:14,334 --> 00:35:16,667
Then go, while you still can!

196
00:35:18,251 --> 00:35:20,834
I'll not forget you, Angus.

197
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:31,334
There's a good girl.

198
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:42,626
Pie and ale, do you want it?
- Ay.

199
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,417
And how!

200
00:37:46,501 --> 00:37:48,959
You dirty sod!
You're all muck and muscle.

201
00:37:49,376 --> 00:37:52,834
Ay, Blossom. The way you like it.

202
00:38:14,376 --> 00:38:18,167
You can do that to me forever
if you like, my Lord.

203
00:38:21,042 --> 00:38:24,667
Will you, Connor?
- Ay, Blossom. I will.

204
00:38:31,417 --> 00:38:32,459
Hello!

205
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:39,876
Greetings.

206
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:44,501
I am Juan Sánchez Villa-Lobos Ramírez,

207
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:47,792
chief metallurgist
to King Charles V of Spain,

208
00:38:48,209 --> 00:38:50,209
and I'm at your service.

209
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:52,126
Who?

210
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,834
What do you want?
- You.

211
00:39:03,209 --> 00:39:06,876
You're Connor MacLeod. - Maybe.
- You're Connor MacLeod,

212
00:39:07,292 --> 00:39:11,251
wounded in battle and
driven from your village of Glenfinnan

213
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,167
five years ago.

214
00:39:14,001 --> 00:39:14,834
Connor!

215
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:19,876
Heather, go in the house.
- I'll stay right here.

216
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,251
Do as I say, woman!

217
00:39:36,459 --> 00:39:38,417
The sensation you're feeling

218
00:39:39,376 --> 00:39:41,292
is the Quickening.

219
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:47,167
Who are you?
- We are the same, MacLeod.

220
00:39:48,334 --> 00:39:50,667
We are brothers!

221
00:39:57,584 --> 00:40:00,376
I knew you guys were bottle-fed...

222
00:40:02,417 --> 00:40:05,626
Yeah, there's not a helluva lot
I can do about it, pal.

223
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:07,751
You see what I'm up against!

224
00:40:08,167 --> 00:40:11,626
His Vietnamese neighbor ate his dog.

225
00:40:12,667 --> 00:40:17,626
That's confidential. How are things
over at forensics? - Dull.

226
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:21,584
How about some lunch?
- Lunch? Good idea. Who pays?

227
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:24,001
Me.
- You're on.

228
00:40:24,417 --> 00:40:28,417
By the way, Frank... The hairs
in the Moretti case matched up.

229
00:40:28,834 --> 00:40:32,001
What did I tell you.
- I forgot my purse.

230
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:34,084
I'll meet you outside.

231
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:37,834
Garfield, we're going to lunch.

232
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:26,834
Sometimes, MacLeod,
the sharpest blade is not enough.

233
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:37,167
B... A... L... A... N... C... E,

234
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:43,084
Balance. - I don't like
boots or water. I'm a man not a fish.

235
00:41:44,292 --> 00:41:46,251
You complain endlessly.

236
00:41:46,709 --> 00:41:51,334
You look like a woman, you stupid
haggis! - Haggis? What is haggis?

237
00:41:51,751 --> 00:41:53,959
A sheep's stomach
stuffed with meat and barley.

238
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:58,376
And what do you do with it?
- You eat it!

239
00:41:59,001 --> 00:42:00,584
How revolting!

240
00:42:02,292 --> 00:42:05,834
Be still for God's sake!
You'll tip us over. - So?

241
00:42:06,251 --> 00:42:09,834
I cannot swim, you Spanish peacock!
- I'm Egyptian.

242
00:42:10,251 --> 00:42:12,959
You said you were from Spain.
You are a liar!

243
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:18,542
You have the manners of a goat,
and you smell like a dungheap,

244
00:42:18,959 --> 00:42:23,292
and you have no knowledge
of your potential. Now!

245
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:25,167
Get out!

246
00:42:27,626 --> 00:42:29,501
Help! Help!

247
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:38,501
Help me, I'm drowning!
- You can't drown, you fool!

248
00:42:38,917 --> 00:42:40,542
You're immortal.

249
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,459
I'm drowning!

250
00:42:45,876 --> 00:42:49,084
We ask you,

251
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:52,126
Heavenly Father...

252
00:42:55,126 --> 00:42:56,084
I'm alive!

253
00:43:01,501 --> 00:43:02,667
I can breathe...

254
00:43:51,501 --> 00:43:56,167
Crude and slow. Your attack was
no better than that of a clumsy child.

255
00:44:04,501 --> 00:44:06,126
This cannot be.

256
00:44:06,959 --> 00:44:08,459
It's the devil's work.

257
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:15,584
You cannot die, MacLeod.
Accept it.

258
00:44:20,626 --> 00:44:22,626
I hate you!
- Good.

259
00:44:23,042 --> 00:44:25,251
That is a perfect way to start.

260
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,334
Tell me,
how did it happen for God's sake?

261
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:36,292
Why does the sun come up?

262
00:44:37,334 --> 00:44:42,376
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night? Who knows?

263
00:44:43,417 --> 00:44:47,334
What I do know is:
Because you were born different

264
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:51,126
men will fear you,
try to drive you away

265
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:53,417
like the people in your village.

266
00:45:04,542 --> 00:45:07,834
You must learn
to conceal your special gift

267
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:10,376
and harness your power

268
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,376
until the time of the Gathering.

269
00:45:16,334 --> 00:45:17,876
What Gathering?

270
00:45:18,542 --> 00:45:20,251
When only a few of us are left,

271
00:45:20,667 --> 00:45:25,751
we will feel an irresistible pull
towards a faraway land

272
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,709
to fight for the prize.

273
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:32,667
Come on!

274
00:45:33,959 --> 00:45:35,167
Faster!

275
00:45:44,709 --> 00:45:46,792
Never lose your temper.

276
00:45:48,626 --> 00:45:51,792
If your head
comes away from your neck, it's over.

277
00:46:17,876 --> 00:46:19,709
Never overextend your thrust.

278
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:24,126
You're vulnerable and off balance.

279
00:46:24,584 --> 00:46:26,209
Connor...

280
00:46:28,001 --> 00:46:29,751
Heather, please!

281
00:46:42,501 --> 00:46:47,084
If it came down to just us two,
would you take my head?

282
00:46:52,876 --> 00:46:56,126
We must fight till only one remains.

283
00:46:56,542 --> 00:47:00,959
You're safe only on holy ground.
None of us will violate that law.

284
00:47:01,376 --> 00:47:03,084
It's tradition.

285
00:47:16,126 --> 00:47:18,292
And now for the last.

286
00:47:19,334 --> 00:47:20,876
Trust me.

287
00:47:24,042 --> 00:47:26,542
Let yourself feel the stag,

288
00:47:29,834 --> 00:47:33,126
his heart beating,

289
00:47:40,459 --> 00:47:42,001
his blood

290
00:47:42,417 --> 00:47:43,459
coursing.

291
00:47:43,834 --> 00:47:45,501
Feel it...

292
00:47:46,876 --> 00:47:49,126
Come on!
- I feel him...

293
00:47:51,209 --> 00:47:52,751
MacLeod, come on!

294
00:47:54,584 --> 00:47:57,126
I feel him!
- Come on!

295
00:48:00,251 --> 00:48:02,417
I feel him!

296
00:48:06,709 --> 00:48:08,959
Come on, Haggis!

297
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:16,834
MacLeod, this is the Quickening!

298
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:58,626
Now, Pendejo... Shall we see
what sort of swordsman you've become?

299
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:00,459
En garde!

300
00:49:09,042 --> 00:49:09,959
Very good.

301
00:49:29,001 --> 00:49:31,084
Give me your hand, brother.

302
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:51,001
That one there. How much is it?

303
00:50:08,792 --> 00:50:10,084
Put him in.

304
00:50:10,709 --> 00:50:12,334
What I want is a family.

305
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:16,542
You cannot have a family.
We cannot have children.

306
00:50:18,876 --> 00:50:22,251
That won't please Heather.
I'll tell you that for nothing.

307
00:50:24,292 --> 00:50:26,417
He's full of life.

308
00:50:28,459 --> 00:50:29,501
Connor!

309
00:50:32,501 --> 00:50:34,417
Here's dinner.

310
00:50:36,417 --> 00:50:39,626
I'll be off now.
I fancy buying me a new dress.

311
00:50:43,459 --> 00:50:46,292
Oh, you little devils... go on!

312
00:50:48,792 --> 00:50:50,542
She is beautiful.

313
00:50:52,334 --> 00:50:54,626
You must leave her, brother.

314
00:51:06,251 --> 00:51:07,376
MacLeod,

315
00:51:08,584 --> 00:51:11,709
I was born 2,437 years ago.

316
00:51:12,751 --> 00:51:15,084
In that time I've had 3 wives.

317
00:51:15,501 --> 00:51:18,417
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

318
00:51:18,834 --> 00:51:23,459
Her father, Masamune, a genius,
made this for me.

319
00:51:24,501 --> 00:51:26,834
In 593 B.C.

320
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,292
It's unique,

321
00:51:32,167 --> 00:51:34,001
like his daughter.

322
00:51:35,501 --> 00:51:38,084
When Shakiko died, I was shattered.

323
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:40,667
I would save you that pain.

324
00:51:41,459 --> 00:51:43,792
Please, let Heather go.

325
00:52:02,417 --> 00:52:07,209
When we first met
you felt ill. Remember?

326
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:12,792
That wasn't the first time
you felt that sensation, was it? - No.

327
00:52:13,209 --> 00:52:17,084
When the MacLeods fought the Frasers
I met a black knight.

328
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:22,417
I felt it then.
Only it was different. More painful.

329
00:52:22,834 --> 00:52:28,001
That black knight was Kurgan.
It's because of him I sought you out.

330
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:33,292
Who is Kurgan?
Where does he come from?

331
00:52:33,709 --> 00:52:37,126
The Kurgans were an ancient people
from the steppes of Russia.

332
00:52:37,542 --> 00:52:42,917
For amusement they threw children into
pits with dogs to fight for meat.

333
00:52:43,334 --> 00:52:47,459
Kurgan is the strongest
of all the immortals.

334
00:52:47,876 --> 00:52:50,584
He is the perfect warrior.

335
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:56,126
If he wins the prize, mortal man
would suffer an eternity of darkness.

336
00:52:57,751 --> 00:52:59,709
How do you fight such a savage?

337
00:53:01,209 --> 00:53:04,667
With heart, faith and steel.

338
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:08,001
In the end there can be only one.

339
00:53:13,126 --> 00:53:18,167
It must have been very dangerous.
- I loved her very much, Heather.

340
00:53:18,584 --> 00:53:21,792
She was the only thing on my mind.
Not danger.

341
00:53:22,209 --> 00:53:26,084
So holding the rose in my teeth,
I climbed up on the rooftop,

342
00:53:26,501 --> 00:53:30,709
lowered a rope
and swung in through the open window.

343
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:37,751
Unfortunately, the lady was not there.
- What did you do?

344
00:53:38,167 --> 00:53:41,376
Well, I introduced myself
to the lady who was there.

345
00:53:41,792 --> 00:53:44,042
She was most helpful.

346
00:53:46,251 --> 00:53:48,292
Would you like some more wine?

347
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:50,126
Yes, please.

348
00:54:02,542 --> 00:54:05,584
Heather, get out.
- What's wrong?

349
00:54:11,667 --> 00:54:12,417
Out!

350
00:54:16,126 --> 00:54:17,376
Kurgan!

351
00:54:19,126 --> 00:54:20,584
Ramírez...

352
00:54:30,042 --> 00:54:31,334
The Highlander...

353
00:54:32,376 --> 00:54:33,584
Where is he?

354
00:54:34,084 --> 00:54:38,542
You're too late. I've prepared him.
- You waste your time!

355
00:55:05,709 --> 00:55:06,584
It hurts?

356
00:55:20,542 --> 00:55:22,376
Now you die!

357
00:55:27,876 --> 00:55:30,709
You cannot win, Ramírez.
I'm the strongest!

358
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:33,042
My cut has improved your voice.

359
00:57:15,251 --> 00:57:16,459
Yes!

360
00:57:49,209 --> 00:57:50,626
Hurts?

361
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:56,584
Who is the woman?

362
00:57:59,251 --> 00:58:00,792
She's mine.

363
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:04,084
Not for much longer.

364
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:16,542
Tonight you sleep in hell.

365
00:58:17,334 --> 00:58:19,292
There can be only one!

366
00:59:06,542 --> 00:59:08,709
Hello, pretty!

367
00:59:19,751 --> 00:59:24,167
I'd like to speak to Mr. Nash.
- I'm sorry, he's not here.

368
00:59:24,584 --> 00:59:29,209
May I call him at home? I have to
talk to him today. - It's impossible.

369
00:59:30,084 --> 00:59:34,292
Good Morning.
- This is Brenda Wyatt, Mr. Nash.

370
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:39,376
We've already met, Rachel.
What can I do for you?

371
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:41,292
I'd like some advice.

372
00:59:41,792 --> 00:59:47,417
Do you take advice?
- That depends. - Advice about what?

373
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:52,709
What can you tell me about a lunatic
hacking away with a broadsword

374
00:59:53,126 --> 00:59:54,292
in 1985?

375
00:59:57,334 --> 00:59:58,209
Not much.

376
00:59:58,626 --> 01:00:04,042
What about a Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C.?

377
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:06,876
I don't deal in exotic weapons.

378
01:00:07,501 --> 01:00:10,584
Can I show you something
in 18th century silver?

379
01:00:11,209 --> 01:00:14,334
That's not why I came here
and you know it.

380
01:00:15,501 --> 01:00:20,876
Do you cook? - Why?
- I thought we might have dinner.

381
01:00:21,417 --> 01:00:22,626
Did you?
- Yes.

382
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:31,584
So, I'm standing there and there's
Brenda! Our little Brenda.

383
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:33,876
You sure it was Brenda?

384
01:00:35,584 --> 01:00:37,834
She was talking to Nash in his shop.

385
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:51,001
What are you looking at, Rachel?
- The eyes in the back of your head.

386
01:00:53,001 --> 01:00:57,584
People are asking about you.
What am I supposed to say?

387
01:01:00,126 --> 01:01:02,459
Tell them I'm immortal.

388
01:01:02,751 --> 01:01:05,667
Attention! Four men over here!

389
01:01:38,251 --> 01:01:40,042
Quiet...

390
01:01:45,876 --> 01:01:47,251
Don't be afraid.

391
01:01:47,792 --> 01:01:49,876
What's your name?
- Rachel.

392
01:01:50,292 --> 01:01:53,584
What happened?
- Everybody is dead.

393
01:01:57,376 --> 01:01:59,209
I'm like you. I'm alone.

394
01:01:59,626 --> 01:02:01,584
Come with me, Rachel.

395
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:21,792
You're alive! Why didn't you die?
- It's a kind of magic.

396
01:02:26,126 --> 01:02:28,209
You should be dead!
- Move!

397
01:02:28,751 --> 01:02:31,376
No! You'll have to shoot me first.

398
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:35,959
Whatever you say, Jack.
You're the master race.

399
01:02:40,084 --> 01:02:41,542
Let's go.

400
01:02:43,501 --> 01:02:45,376
That was a long time ago.

401
01:02:46,292 --> 01:02:49,126
Listen to me for one moment, please.

402
01:02:50,334 --> 01:02:54,209
You can't hide your feelings from me.
I've known you too long.

403
01:02:54,626 --> 01:02:57,917
What feelings?
- How about loneliness?

404
01:02:58,501 --> 01:03:00,584
I'm not lonely.

405
01:03:01,209 --> 01:03:05,167
I've got everything I need right here.
- Oh no, you don't.

406
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:10,084
You refuse to let anyone love you.

407
01:03:11,126 --> 01:03:12,751
Love is for poets.

408
01:03:17,376 --> 01:03:20,001
You're such a romantic, Rachel.

409
01:03:21,126 --> 01:03:23,042
You always were.

410
01:03:45,501 --> 01:03:47,126
Just a minute!

411
01:04:06,334 --> 01:04:07,501
Good evening.

412
01:04:12,709 --> 01:04:16,042
Do you want to dine in the hall,
or shall we step inside?

413
01:04:18,501 --> 01:04:20,292
Come in.

414
01:04:21,917 --> 01:04:24,334
May I take your coat?
- No thanks. - What?

415
01:04:24,751 --> 01:04:27,626
I'll hold on to it.
- Oh, fine.

416
01:04:32,084 --> 01:04:34,709
Where are you going?
- I forgot my earrings.

417
01:04:35,126 --> 01:04:38,667
Make yourself a drink.
There are glasses in the bar.

418
01:04:51,084 --> 01:04:52,792
Do you know what you're doing?

419
01:05:14,584 --> 01:05:16,251
I like your place, Brenda.

420
01:05:16,667 --> 01:05:20,501
I've only been here 3 months.
I'm still clearing it up.

421
01:05:24,959 --> 01:05:28,126
Interesting view.
- What did you say?

422
01:05:33,792 --> 01:05:36,251
I said, "Interesting view."

423
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,001
Isn't it great?

424
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:48,751
You never told me
what you do for a living.

425
01:05:49,501 --> 01:05:53,084
I work for the Metropolitan Museum

426
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,376
in Aquisitions.

427
01:05:59,334 --> 01:06:02,001
That explains your interest
in ancient weapons.

428
01:06:03,959 --> 01:06:05,084
Right...

429
01:06:07,042 --> 01:06:09,126
Especially the Samurai.

430
01:06:10,417 --> 01:06:11,751
Very nice.

431
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:15,626
Shall we have a toast?
- Yes.

432
01:06:20,917 --> 01:06:22,167
Brandy...

433
01:06:23,209 --> 01:06:25,584
Bottled in 1783.

434
01:06:26,001 --> 01:06:27,709
Wow, that's old...

435
01:06:30,626 --> 01:06:33,167
1783 was a very good year.

436
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:38,084
Mozart wrote his Great Mass.

437
01:06:39,792 --> 01:06:41,459
The Montgolfier Brothers

438
01:06:41,876 --> 01:06:44,126
went up in their first balloon.

439
01:06:48,084 --> 01:06:52,209
And England recognized
the independence of the United States.

440
01:06:52,626 --> 01:06:54,001
Is that right?

441
01:06:55,042 --> 01:06:55,959
Yes.

442
01:07:03,626 --> 01:07:05,251
What's that?

443
01:07:06,417 --> 01:07:10,459
It's for you. - Can I open it?
- If you like...

444
01:07:25,167 --> 01:07:27,459
You bastard! Where did you find this?

445
01:07:27,876 --> 01:07:30,501
I have an extensive library.

446
01:07:32,001 --> 01:07:35,417
Odd thing,
your bio doesn't mention the Met.

447
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:39,709
It says you work for the police.
In forensics.

448
01:07:40,126 --> 01:07:43,917
Are you and Moran trying to set me up?
- I don't work for Moran.

449
01:07:44,334 --> 01:07:48,834
Then why does that bald policeman
sit outside and watch your apartment?

450
01:07:50,459 --> 01:07:52,751
You remember him.
Moran's had him tailing me.

451
01:07:53,167 --> 01:07:54,792
What're you gonna do?

452
01:07:55,751 --> 01:08:00,876
The question is what're you gonna do?
Turn off the tape or shoot me?

453
01:08:04,959 --> 01:08:08,584
I'm not looking for a killer
but for the sword used on Fasil.

454
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:12,542
I found pieces of it under the Garden.
I only want to see the Samurai. - Why?

455
01:08:12,959 --> 01:08:17,376
Because it's not supposed to exist!
I dated some of the blade at 600 B.C.

456
01:08:17,751 --> 01:08:22,251
The metal had been folded 200 times.
They only did that in the Middle Ages!

457
01:08:22,667 --> 01:08:24,959
Where the hell did it come from?

458
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:28,417
If I could verify its existence,
it would be like the discovery

459
01:08:28,834 --> 01:08:32,876
of a 747 a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

460
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:35,292
This is crazy.

461
01:08:35,709 --> 01:08:39,167
Wait a minute, Nash!
I want some answers.

462
01:08:40,209 --> 01:08:41,792
You want...?

463
01:08:42,792 --> 01:08:45,792
Don't you ever think about anything
except what you want?

464
01:09:00,792 --> 01:09:03,126
You must leave her, brother.

465
01:10:23,084 --> 01:10:24,126
Heather!

466
01:10:44,167 --> 01:10:46,334
Connor, I'm here!

467
01:11:08,542 --> 01:11:10,667
My beautiful man.

468
01:11:11,876 --> 01:11:13,834
My husband.

469
01:11:14,251 --> 01:11:16,376
I am that, my love.

470
01:11:20,459 --> 01:11:22,876
I've never really known...

471
01:11:24,042 --> 01:11:25,167
What?

472
01:11:26,834 --> 01:11:28,876
... why you stayed.

473
01:11:31,126 --> 01:11:34,751
Because I love you as much now
as the first day we met.

474
01:11:37,792 --> 01:11:39,542
And I love you.

475
01:11:44,292 --> 01:11:46,001
I don't want to die.

476
01:11:47,167 --> 01:11:49,084
I want to stay with you.

477
01:11:49,501 --> 01:11:50,917
Forever.

478
01:11:51,334 --> 01:11:53,001
I want that, too.

479
01:11:54,501 --> 01:11:57,084
Will you do something for me, Connor?

480
01:11:59,459 --> 01:12:01,251
What, Blossom?

481
01:12:02,376 --> 01:12:07,917
In the years to come, will you light a
candle and remember me on my birthday?

482
01:12:09,251 --> 01:12:10,709
Ay, love.

483
01:12:11,126 --> 01:12:12,626
I will.

484
01:12:13,542 --> 01:12:16,001
I wanted to have your children.

485
01:12:18,209 --> 01:12:20,501
They would have been strong and fine.

486
01:12:25,042 --> 01:12:27,584
Don't see me, Connor.

487
01:12:28,001 --> 01:12:30,251
Let me die in peace.

488
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:34,334
Where are we?

489
01:12:41,667 --> 01:12:43,709
We're in the Highlands.

490
01:12:46,584 --> 01:12:47,834
Where else?

491
01:12:51,542 --> 01:12:54,042
Running down a mountain side.

492
01:13:08,042 --> 01:13:09,751
The sun is shining.

493
01:13:11,542 --> 01:13:13,126
It's not cold.

494
01:13:15,126 --> 01:13:17,709
You've got your sheepskins on

495
01:13:21,542 --> 01:13:24,667
and the boots I made for you.

496
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:30,001
Goodnight, my bonny Heather.

497
01:13:45,334 --> 01:13:47,292
Hey, Kastagir.

498
01:13:49,792 --> 01:13:53,042
MacLeod. It's good to see you again.

499
01:13:53,459 --> 01:13:55,626
It seems like 100 years.

500
01:13:56,042 --> 01:13:57,709
It's been 100 years.

501
01:14:06,084 --> 01:14:07,667
How've you been?

502
01:14:10,501 --> 01:14:11,292
Hey,

503
01:14:12,917 --> 01:14:15,084
this puts hairs on your chest.

504
01:14:18,126 --> 01:14:20,584
What is it?
- Boom-boom!

505
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:24,959
A big strong man like you shouldn't
be afraid of a little boom-boom!

506
01:14:25,334 --> 01:14:29,834
Maybe you think I want to poison you?
- I think you're crazy.

507
01:14:32,709 --> 01:14:34,792
So, the Gathering is here.

508
01:14:37,834 --> 01:14:42,626
Time has almost caught us, my friend.
- Has it? Shall we go on?

509
01:14:45,084 --> 01:14:47,042
I think we should have a party.

510
01:14:47,459 --> 01:14:52,709
Oh no! I remember the last time we had
a party. - Really, when was that?

511
01:14:53,126 --> 01:14:54,834
It was 1783.

512
01:14:55,251 --> 01:14:57,376
1783...

513
01:14:58,167 --> 01:15:01,959
Oh yes, your famous duel
on Boston Common.

514
01:15:03,167 --> 01:15:07,001
You were drunk. What was that guy's
name again? - His name was Bassett.

515
01:15:07,417 --> 01:15:11,959
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett!
- I'm fighting the duel not you!

516
01:15:13,959 --> 01:15:15,751
See if the imbecile is ready.

517
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:20,251
Mr. Bassett is waiting, Sir.
- Tell him I'm ready.

518
01:15:20,709 --> 01:15:22,709
Christ! I've gone blind!

519
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:25,167
En garde, Sir!

520
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:32,959
Wonderful, Sir.
- Thank you, Hotchkiss.

521
01:15:33,876 --> 01:15:37,001
Bassett, is that you?

522
01:15:37,459 --> 01:15:39,209
You missed him.

523
01:16:00,542 --> 01:16:01,459
Stop, Sir!

524
01:16:01,876 --> 01:16:03,376
I beseech...

525
01:16:03,792 --> 01:16:05,417
I apologize for calling

526
01:16:05,834 --> 01:16:09,126
your wife a bloated warthog,

527
01:16:09,542 --> 01:16:11,834
and I bid you good day.

528
01:16:14,501 --> 01:16:18,251
Shoot him, Sir? Shoot him.
Now, Sir, in the back of the head.

529
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:21,667
Hotchkiss... Hotchkiss, stop it!

530
01:16:23,376 --> 01:16:25,792
Hotchkiss...?
- Sir?

531
01:16:26,209 --> 01:16:27,751
No, Sir...

532
01:16:36,292 --> 01:16:38,209
That's the mood of New York right now,

533
01:16:38,626 --> 01:16:42,042
an angry city in the grip of fear.
- Get out of here! Get out of here!

534
01:16:54,001 --> 01:16:57,042
Give us a drink, pal.
- Got a joint?

535
01:17:02,209 --> 01:17:03,292
Hey, Rockefeller.

536
01:17:03,709 --> 01:17:08,042
Hope you liked Candy?
She said you were kind of kinky, huh?

537
01:17:10,001 --> 01:17:12,209
Don't ever speak to me.

538
01:17:18,209 --> 01:17:19,584
I didn't mean...

539
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:26,209
Don't ever speak to me again!

540
01:17:26,626 --> 01:17:28,376
Do you understand?

541
01:17:30,459 --> 01:17:32,084
Good.

542
01:17:36,876 --> 01:17:40,376
I hope you
get your head chopped off, asshole!

543
01:17:42,417 --> 01:17:45,292
And you, shut it!

544
01:18:18,792 --> 01:18:19,751
What the hell...

545
01:18:33,876 --> 01:18:36,334
Okay, Marine... This is for real.

546
01:18:42,126 --> 01:18:43,209
Let's go!

547
01:18:47,084 --> 01:18:49,209
Go, go, go! Come on!

548
01:19:01,792 --> 01:19:03,834
What the hell's going on?

549
01:20:58,209 --> 01:20:59,251
For God's sake...

550
01:21:11,917 --> 01:21:13,292
Look at that!

551
01:21:51,542 --> 01:21:53,001
Mother of God...

552
01:21:57,459 --> 01:21:58,709
Mum!

553
01:22:03,876 --> 01:22:06,251
Hey, where you're going with my car?

554
01:22:06,667 --> 01:22:09,959
Help me, Daddy! Daddy! Help me!

555
01:22:19,292 --> 01:22:24,542
Easy, Frank! I checked all over.
There just aren't any witnesses!

556
01:22:25,501 --> 01:22:26,626
That's New York!

557
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:29,501
20 people standing around,
nobody saw a goddamned thing.

558
01:22:29,917 --> 01:22:33,001
Tell me about this Matunas?
Is he on drugs? - He's a survival man.

559
01:22:33,417 --> 01:22:36,042
What? - He's into guns.
He's a Marine, a Vietnam vet.

560
01:22:36,459 --> 01:22:41,001
I talked to his ex-CO. He said the guy
was a bit paranoid, but he was good.

561
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:49,667
How you doing? - Okay, for someone
who had 3 feet of steel in the gut...

562
01:22:50,501 --> 01:22:53,209
I understand
you saw the guy who stuck you?

563
01:22:53,626 --> 01:22:55,126
You kidding me, man?

564
01:22:55,542 --> 01:22:57,084
Is that him?

565
01:22:57,584 --> 01:22:58,334
No.

566
01:22:59,751 --> 01:23:03,751
Quit kidding! It was dark!
- The freak was trying to kill me!

567
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:09,292
I'll never forget his face. He had a
scar across his neck. That's not him.

568
01:23:09,709 --> 01:23:10,834
Shit!

569
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:15,834
Depressed?
- Yeah.

570
01:23:17,251 --> 01:23:19,667
Don't go on about "depressed."

571
01:23:20,084 --> 01:23:24,084
I got me a 357,
I got me a trunk load of shotguns,

572
01:23:24,501 --> 01:23:27,667
3 big bore rifles
and ammo up to my ass.

573
01:23:28,251 --> 01:23:30,876
I'm not safe...
I can't protect myself!

574
01:23:31,292 --> 01:23:32,542
Take it easy!

575
01:23:33,751 --> 01:23:36,542
That weirdo, he stood up

576
01:23:36,959 --> 01:23:41,126
after I'd put enough lead in him
to drop a rhino.

577
01:23:41,542 --> 01:23:44,376
Do you think you could work
with one of our artists,

578
01:23:44,834 --> 01:23:49,542
maybe come up with a picture of
this guy? - Sure, sure, yes.

579
01:23:50,292 --> 01:23:52,167
Take it easy, pal.

580
01:23:53,292 --> 01:23:55,167
Hey, cop!
- Yes?

581
01:23:55,584 --> 01:23:57,626
I know you guys think I'm nuts,

582
01:23:59,042 --> 01:24:00,667
but there's something else.

583
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:04,126
After he threw me against the wall...

584
01:24:23,626 --> 01:24:27,709
This is like one step beyond. - Yeah.
Remember, we've got one eye-witness.

585
01:24:28,126 --> 01:24:32,209
Don't say anything about swordfights
and guys glowing in the dark.

586
01:24:36,376 --> 01:24:38,376
Have you read what it says here?

587
01:24:38,792 --> 01:24:41,876
You kidding, Tony?
You know cops can't read.

588
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:44,751
What does "incompetent" mean?

589
01:24:46,209 --> 01:24:50,209
That mayor calls me
at 2 o'clock in the morning!

590
01:24:50,626 --> 01:24:52,876
I don't answer the phone anymore.

591
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:56,042
What does "baffled" mean?

592
01:25:27,667 --> 01:25:30,667
Karen Joan Nash...

593
01:25:32,667 --> 01:25:34,542
Yeah, I remember this one.

594
01:25:34,959 --> 01:25:39,792
I was practicing in Syracuse;
didn't get many of these. - What?

595
01:25:40,209 --> 01:25:44,251
Unwed mothers.
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

596
01:25:45,542 --> 01:25:48,501
Back then in Syracuse
it was a stoning offense.

597
01:25:50,917 --> 01:25:51,917
What happened?

598
01:25:53,209 --> 01:25:56,626
She had the baby and she died.
- Nash was illegitimate?

599
01:25:57,042 --> 01:26:00,209
Oh, yes. He was illegitimate.

600
01:26:00,626 --> 01:26:04,167
For about a minute and a half.
He died right after she did.

601
01:26:08,626 --> 01:26:09,959
He died?

602
01:26:21,001 --> 01:26:22,417
Hello, Brenda.

603
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:27,251
Last night I went through the deeds
to Nash's house in Hudson Street,

604
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:32,751
back through the five previous owners
to the original: Montague in 1796.

605
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:36,334
In all five instances,
Montague through Nash,

606
01:26:36,751 --> 01:26:40,376
I found a death certificate for a kid
with the same name who died at birth,

607
01:26:40,792 --> 01:26:44,459
years before he pretended
to sign for his inheritance.

608
01:26:45,501 --> 01:26:47,376
Isn't there any heat in here?

609
01:26:47,792 --> 01:26:49,792
No, heat is bad for the circuits.

610
01:26:50,209 --> 01:26:53,084
Now, just in case
there's any doubt...

611
01:27:15,167 --> 01:27:20,001
what you've got is a guy who's been
creeping around since at least 1700;

612
01:27:20,417 --> 01:27:22,584
pretending to croak
every once in a while;

613
01:27:23,001 --> 01:27:26,792
leaving all these goods to kids
who've been corpses for years

614
01:27:27,167 --> 01:27:29,334
and assuming their identities.

615
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:36,917
That's not possible.

616
01:27:39,167 --> 01:27:43,042
Late extra!
Cops release Headhunter picture!

617
01:27:43,459 --> 01:27:46,876
Reward offered!
Headhunter revealed!

618
01:28:20,626 --> 01:28:22,876
For you, my bonny Heather.

619
01:28:24,126 --> 01:28:26,001
Happy birthday.

620
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:30,167
And for you, Juan Ramírez.

621
01:28:32,209 --> 01:28:34,751
Take care of her,
you overdressed haggis.

622
01:29:12,042 --> 01:29:14,251
Kastagir is gone.

623
01:29:14,667 --> 01:29:17,001
Only you and I remain.

624
01:29:24,626 --> 01:29:26,334
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

625
01:29:28,042 --> 01:29:29,584
Who cuts your hair?

626
01:29:30,001 --> 01:29:32,709
I'm in disguise.

627
01:29:34,126 --> 01:29:36,792
This way no one will recognize me.

628
01:29:39,501 --> 01:29:40,542
I do.

629
01:29:42,667 --> 01:29:45,084
What do you want?
- Your head.

630
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:48,417
And the prize.

631
01:29:50,709 --> 01:29:52,042
Watch.

632
01:29:52,751 --> 01:29:55,042
Happy Halloween, ladies!

633
01:30:04,542 --> 01:30:07,417
Nuns! No sense of humor...

634
01:30:08,459 --> 01:30:12,917
Ramírez's blade did not
cut deeply enough.

635
01:30:13,334 --> 01:30:15,209
He was right about you. You're slime.

636
01:30:15,626 --> 01:30:18,126
Ramírez was an effete snob.

637
01:30:18,542 --> 01:30:20,667
He died on his knees.

638
01:30:21,084 --> 01:30:22,626
I took his head

639
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:26,626
and raped his woman
before his blood was even cold.

640
01:30:35,626 --> 01:30:37,834
I see!

641
01:30:38,667 --> 01:30:40,542
Ramírez lied.

642
01:30:43,459 --> 01:30:45,626
She was not his woman.

643
01:30:46,667 --> 01:30:48,501
She was your woman,

644
01:30:49,209 --> 01:30:51,542
and she never told you.

645
01:30:52,667 --> 01:30:54,959
I wonder why.

646
01:30:55,376 --> 01:30:59,792
Perhaps I gave her something
you never could

647
01:31:01,917 --> 01:31:06,251
and secretly
she yearned for my return.

648
01:31:06,667 --> 01:31:08,667
Holy ground, Highlander!

649
01:31:09,084 --> 01:31:12,126
Remember what Ramírez taught you.

650
01:31:16,834 --> 01:31:19,417
You can't stay in here forever.

651
01:31:22,334 --> 01:31:24,334
You are weak, Highlander.

652
01:31:24,834 --> 01:31:30,251
You will always be weaker than I.

653
01:31:34,376 --> 01:31:36,084
I'll be out front.

654
01:31:40,667 --> 01:31:42,209
Goodbye, MacLeod.

655
01:31:42,626 --> 01:31:45,167
We will meet soon enough.

656
01:31:57,376 --> 01:31:59,459
This is the house of God.

657
01:31:59,876 --> 01:32:02,584
People are trying to pray.
You're disturbing them.

658
01:32:04,251 --> 01:32:07,792
He cares about these helpless mortals?

659
01:32:09,001 --> 01:32:10,917
Of course he cares.

660
01:32:11,334 --> 01:32:13,334
He died for our sins.

661
01:32:13,751 --> 01:32:15,709
That shall be his undoing.

662
01:32:17,959 --> 01:32:18,959
Father,

663
01:32:20,167 --> 01:32:21,876
forgive me.

664
01:32:22,292 --> 01:32:24,792
I am a worm.

665
01:32:38,209 --> 01:32:40,584
I have something to say.

666
01:32:41,001 --> 01:32:44,417
It's better to burn out
than to fade away.

667
01:32:54,042 --> 01:32:55,167
I need to see him!

668
01:32:55,584 --> 01:32:58,584
I'm afraid that's impossible.
Mr. Nash is...

669
01:32:59,501 --> 01:33:02,126
Mr. Nash is dead, Miss Ellenstein!

670
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:08,251
What are you doing here?
- Looking for a dead guy named Nash.

671
01:33:08,667 --> 01:33:10,709
He died at birth in Syracuse.

672
01:33:17,001 --> 01:33:18,167
Alright.

673
01:33:19,334 --> 01:33:20,709
Come on.

674
01:33:47,126 --> 01:33:49,251
Are the claymores real?

675
01:33:50,834 --> 01:33:55,084
What is this? A museum?
This stuff must be worth a fortune.

676
01:34:03,959 --> 01:34:07,126
I have been alive
for four and a half centuries.

677
01:34:07,542 --> 01:34:09,042
I cannot die.

678
01:34:11,792 --> 01:34:14,209
Well, everybody's got their problems.

679
01:34:20,917 --> 01:34:22,376
What're you gonna do with that?

680
01:34:22,792 --> 01:34:24,334
Take it.

681
01:34:39,126 --> 01:34:42,042
I am Connor MacLeod
of the clan MacLeod.

682
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:47,584
I was born in 1518 in the Glennfinnan
village on the shores of Loch Shiel.

683
01:34:49,834 --> 01:34:51,542
And I am immortal.

684
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:36,167
You're not listening. - It won't work.
I can't get involved, not again.

685
01:36:49,501 --> 01:36:51,751
Do you know what's weird?

686
01:36:52,167 --> 01:36:54,417
Most people are afraid to die.

687
01:36:54,834 --> 01:36:57,001
That's not your problem.

688
01:36:57,417 --> 01:36:59,709
You're afraid to live.

689
01:37:04,376 --> 01:37:06,292
Take care of yourself.

690
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:08,626
Don't lose your head.

691
01:37:24,292 --> 01:37:26,167
Hello, my pretty.

692
01:37:31,084 --> 01:37:31,876
Come on!

693
01:37:41,126 --> 01:37:42,584
Mamma mia...

694
01:38:04,626 --> 01:38:06,126
Ever played chicken?

695
01:38:52,459 --> 01:38:53,667
Excuse me!

696
01:39:17,334 --> 01:39:18,709
Watch out!

697
01:39:46,959 --> 01:39:50,417
Shut up.
- Come on, sing along. - Shut up!

698
01:39:57,792 --> 01:39:59,126
Stop!

699
01:40:40,501 --> 01:40:45,501
I can entertain myself. Your friend
is a real screamer. Listen.

700
01:40:46,417 --> 01:40:48,959
Which part should I cut off first?

701
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:51,084
I'll be waiting.

702
01:40:57,667 --> 01:40:59,751
The endless killing
has driven him mad.

703
01:41:00,167 --> 01:41:04,542
Rachel, there are some instructions
in the desk drawer. Follow them.

704
01:41:04,959 --> 01:41:09,334
There is a power of attorney for you.
You'll have everything you need.

705
01:41:10,376 --> 01:41:12,126
You're not coming back...

706
01:41:13,584 --> 01:41:17,626
Even if you kill him
you're not coming back, are you?

707
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:32,167
Sweet Rachel,
you always knew this would happen.

708
01:41:33,209 --> 01:41:35,417
Russell Nash dies tonight.

709
01:41:50,751 --> 01:41:53,626
Hey, it's a kind of magic...

710
01:42:03,042 --> 01:42:04,709
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

711
01:47:22,459 --> 01:47:24,417
So now it ends.

712
01:47:43,001 --> 01:47:44,584
What kept you?

713
01:50:00,459 --> 01:50:02,417
There can be only one.

714
01:50:35,167 --> 01:50:38,167
The Quickening overcomes me!

715
01:50:39,042 --> 01:50:41,251
I know everything!

716
01:50:42,042 --> 01:50:45,167
I know! I know everything!

717
01:51:47,584 --> 01:51:49,376
So, this is where it all began.

718
01:51:50,709 --> 01:51:53,084
Can you tell me about the prize?

719
01:51:53,501 --> 01:51:55,709
It's like a whirlwind in my head.

720
01:51:56,126 --> 01:52:01,042
If I concentrate, I know what people
are thinking all over the world.

721
01:52:01,459 --> 01:52:03,376
Presidents, diplomats,

722
01:52:03,792 --> 01:52:05,334
scientists.

723
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:08,626
I can help them understand each other.

724
01:52:09,542 --> 01:52:11,376
What am I thinking?

725
01:52:11,792 --> 01:52:15,501
You're wondering
whether or not you can love me.

726
01:52:15,917 --> 01:52:21,167
I'm just like you. I can love
and have children. Live and grow old.

727
01:52:21,584 --> 01:52:25,126
You never prepared me for that,
you Spanish peacock.

728
01:52:26,959 --> 01:52:31,042
Patience, Highlander.
You have done well.

729
01:52:31,501 --> 01:52:33,251
But it will take time.

730
01:52:33,667 --> 01:52:36,667
Generations are being born and dying.

731
01:52:38,709 --> 01:52:40,792
You are at one with all living things.

732
01:52:41,209 --> 01:52:44,584
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

733
01:52:46,167 --> 01:52:48,667
You have power beyond imagination.

734
01:52:49,084 --> 01:52:54,001
Use it well, my friend.
Don't lose your head.

735
