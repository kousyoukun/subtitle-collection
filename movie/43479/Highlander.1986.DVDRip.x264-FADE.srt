00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,810
# Here we are #

3
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:34,890
# Born to be kings #

4
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,690
# We're the princes
of the universe #

5
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,330
# Here we belong #

6
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,530
# Fighting to survive #

7
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:51,690
# ln a world
with the darkest power #

8
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,530
# And here we are #

9
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:07,370
# We're the princes
of the universe #

10
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:12,090
# Here we belong
fighting for survival #

11
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:17,690
# We've come to be
the rulers of your world #

12
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,050
# I am immortal #

13
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,730
# I have inside me blood of kings #

14
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:34,690
# I have no rival #

15
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,890
# No man can be my equal #

16
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:42,770
# Take me to the future
of your world ##

17
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,290
...and the Tonga Kid.

18
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,890
Their opponents,
in the corner to my right...

19
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:01,890
with a combined weight of 745 pounds...

20
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,130
the toasts of the coasts...

21
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,090
from Brad Street, U.S.A.,
Atlanta, Georgia...

22
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,490
the Fabulous Freebirds!

23
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,690
Yeah!

24
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,050
You gotta love it!

25
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:43,010
Kill him!
Stomp on the son of--

26
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,570
Hey! Where you going?

27
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,450
Macleod.

28
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,530
Fasil. Wait.

29
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:35,850
Aah!

30
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,690
All right.

31
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:34,490
Macleod!

32
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:38,330
Clan Macleod!

33
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:52,210
May this year
of our Lord 1536...

34
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:55,610
bring victory
to the Clan Macleod!

35
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,010
Macleod!

36
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:00,050
Victory to Macleod!

37
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:08,650
Hurry up! Hurry up!

38
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,730
Are you scared, Connor?

39
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:17,850
No, Cousin Dugal.
I'm not!

40
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,730
Don't talk nonsense, man.

41
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:23,810
I peed my kilt the first time
I went into battle.

42
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,130
Oh, aye.

43
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:27,410
Angus pees his kilt
all the time!

44
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,170
Connor!

45
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,450
Connor, wait!

46
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,530
Wait!

47
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,850
Take these flowers
and think of me.

48
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:03,250
Remember, you fight with God
on your side, Connor.

49
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,370
A girl like that
can wound a soldier...

50
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,330
more than a Frazer sword,
my friend.

51
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:10,010
Angus! You and Dugal
keep him in one piece!

52
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:12,690
Aye, we all know
what piece that is!

53
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:57,570
There is one called Connor
among them.

54
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,930
Aye.

55
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:06,210
Remember our
agreement, Murdoch.

56
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,930
The boy is mine.

57
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,850
It's begun.

58
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,770
Death to the Macleods!

59
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:17,650
Death to the Macleods!

60
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:20,650
Yay! Yay!

61
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,850
Death to the Frazers!

62
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,890
Yay! Yah!

63
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:50,690
Macleod!

64
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,050
Come on!

65
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:08,850
Macleod!

66
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,650
Now you stay under.

67
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,490
Forgive me... my son.

68
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,850
Fight me, damn you!

69
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,450
Fight me, cowards!

70
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:26,050
No, not him!

71
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,330
Castrate the heathens!

72
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,490
Nobody will fight me!

73
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:39,970
They all run away.

74
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:43,330
Here, laddie, stay by me.

75
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,170
Mother of God.

76
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:57,410
Fight me!

77
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,410
No!

78
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:14,650
Come on, quick!

79
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,490
There can be only one!

80
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,410
Another time, Macleod!

81
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,450
Get out of the car!

82
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:59,810
Put your hands
on the hood!

83
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:01,810
Move!

84
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:03,970
Okay!

85
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,250
Watch it, freak!
Just cool it!

86
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,770
Watch him!
Watch him!

87
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:12,170
Move! Come on!
Come on! Move!

88
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,210
Come on!
Get up there!

89
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,290
Spread 'em!
Spread 'em!

90
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,490
Come on!

91
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:22,250
Let's see
some I.D., pal.

92
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,370
Well, Mr. Nash.

93
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:29,530
Where were you going
in such a hurry?

94
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,330
Give me it!
Give me it!

95
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,410
Ooh!

96
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,850
Don't move, pal.

97
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,930
Don't even breathe!

98
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,610
In nomine patri et filii
et spiritu sancti.

99
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,010
Amen.

100
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:31,730
It is over.

101
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,170
No!

102
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,690
Other men are
dying this day.

103
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,730
I must attend them.

104
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,250
Quiet!

105
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,570
He's a highlander, by God!

106
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,970
The last sound he hears...

107
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:52,530
shouldn't be that
of a wailing woman!

108
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,970
Hey, let me through.

109
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,730
Damn it, Frank.
Forensics is supposed to be notified...

110
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,890
the same time as homicide.

111
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,370
Holy shit.

112
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:27,210
Yeah, this one came unassembled.

113
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,730
Did you make an arrest?

114
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,810
No. We're questioning
some guy named Nash.

115
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,050
Antique dealer on Hudson Street.

116
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:36,610
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, Walt.

117
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:38,850
You look pretty, Brenda.

118
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,290
What do you think's...

119
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:42,090
the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?

120
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:45,370
You're a barrel
of laughs, Garfield.

121
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,330
Get your hands off!

122
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,250
Try explaining this to my wife!

123
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,450
Get me a cherry-cheese danish too.

124
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:55,530
What time did he buy it?

125
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,050
About 10:00, 10:30.

126
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,650
Whatever cut him
was razor sharp.

127
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:03,490
Get out of here
with these cameras!

128
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:05,450
Frank! Frank!

129
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,490
Oh, my God.

130
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:11,210
A guy was killed
like this in Jersey.

131
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,930
What the hell.
That's Jersey.

132
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,490
I want out!

133
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,730
Hey, Frank. Come here.

134
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,970
Aw, shit!

135
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,930
Ooh, baby.
Look at you.

136
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:28,930
Garfield, cover that head.

137
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,010
What the hell
have you got?

138
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,210
A Toledo-Salamanca.

139
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:39,570
A what?

140
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,210
A sword, Frank.
A very rare sword.

141
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:44,170
Is it worth much?

142
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,570
Only about a million bucks.

143
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,410
Any antique dealer
on Hudson Street...

144
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,850
could tell you that.

145
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:57,130
You can't keep me here!

146
00:19:57,170 --> 00:19:59,210
I know my rights!

147
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:30,410
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

148
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:32,570
His name's Vazilek,
Polish national.

149
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,850
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

150
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:38,330
You ever get over
to New Jersey, Nash?

151
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,410
Not if I can help it.

152
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,290
You talk funny.
Where you from?

153
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,250
Lots of different places.

154
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,570
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hmm.

155
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,130
Okay. What's that?

156
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,610
A sword?

157
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:57,650
Wise up, smart ass.

158
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,130
It's a Toledo-Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million bucks.

159
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,490
So?

160
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,330
So you want to hear a theory?

161
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:09,970
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy--

162
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,450
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

163
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,330
Okay, his name's
lman Fasil.

164
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:17,250
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

165
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,610
Want to hear another theory?

166
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:22,050
This Fasil was so upset...

167
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,570
about the lousy
wrestling tonight...

168
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:30,530
in a fit of depression,
he cut off his own head.

169
00:21:30,610 --> 00:21:32,370
That's not funny, Walt.

170
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,330
Are you a faggot, Nash?

171
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:37,090
Why? You cruising
for a piece of ass?

172
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,650
I'll tell you
what happened, Russell.

173
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,530
You went down to the garage
for a blow job.

174
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:45,770
You just didn't
want to pay for it.

175
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,530
Huh. You are sick.

176
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,770
Hey! Hey!

177
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,250
Hey, what are you doing?

178
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:54,450
Stop!

179
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,890
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

180
00:21:56,970 --> 00:22:00,250
That's enough!
Now, cut it out!

181
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:02,850
Goddamn it,
I said cut it out!

182
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,810
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

183
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,770
Then we're through.

184
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:11,050
Nash, we're just
getting started.

185
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,450
...in water from the sprinkler.

186
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:19,290
It also left a man's
decapitated body...

187
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,610
next to his own severed head.

188
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:26,010
A head which at this time
has no name.

189
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:28,090
I know his name.

190
00:22:30,290 --> 00:22:32,890
# Here I am #

191
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,730
# I'm the master
of your destiny #

192
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:39,370
Ahh!

193
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:43,610
# I am the one
The only one #

194
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:46,450
# I am the god
of kingdom come #

195
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,730
# Give me the prize #

196
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,130
# Just give me the prize ##

197
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,970
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger.

198
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,530
Room 315.

199
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:08,250
And I'll hit you
for 20 in advance.

200
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:14,410
Uh, hey, uh.

201
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:16,810
If there's anything
you need--

202
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,410
Broads, uh, blow.
Just dial 0, huh?

203
00:23:20,490 --> 00:23:22,690
That's right, Mr. Kruger.

204
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:25,410
Lucky Strike means
fine tobacco.

205
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,690
Don't talk to the guests.

206
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,330
I didn't do nothing.

207
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,090
At last...

208
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,890
the gathering.

209
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,170
Hi.

210
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,570
I'm Candy.

211
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,050
Of course you are.

212
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:46,530
Come on in.

213
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,890
Hiya. Got a present
from the coroner.

214
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,690
Pieces of metal found
on the dead guy under the Garden.

215
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,410
In the wound
and on the clothes.

216
00:24:57,450 --> 00:24:59,290
Real smooth shave.

217
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,730
That can't be right.

218
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,450
Son of a bitch.

219
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,290
Who's there?

220
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,130
Hey, Brenda. Usual?

221
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,570
Lots of it.

222
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,330
# ls better than
a lifetime alone #

223
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,930
Say when.

224
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,610
# One sentimental moment
in your arms #

225
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:54,730
When.

226
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:57,650
# Is like a shooting star... #

227
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,250
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

228
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:02,650
Double Glenmoran on the rocks.

229
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:04,010
Glenmoran. Right.

230
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,450
Go to the Garden often?

231
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,970
What did you say?

232
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:14,970
# I'm a prisoner of love
inside you #

233
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:19,490
# I'm falling apart all around you #

234
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,570
What did you say?

235
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,890
Madison...Square...Garden.

236
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,610
Do you go there often?

237
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,690
Why?

238
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,450
Basketball?

239
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,490
The circus? Wrestling?

240
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,690
Why are you asking me?

241
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,650
Have you been following me?

242
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:44,610
I'd like to walk
you home, Brenda.

243
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,450
I can take care of myself.

244
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:59,930
# It's always a rainy day without you #

245
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,930
# I'm a prisoner of love
inside you #

246
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:07,850
# I'm falling apart #

247
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,690
# All around you ##

248
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,610
Be quiet!

249
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:06,770
Unnhhrr!

250
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:11,450
Aah!

251
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,330
Here. Take this.

252
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,410
Nice to see you
again, Macleod.

253
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:57,170
Nice to see you--

254
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,170
Stop!

255
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,930
There can be only one!

256
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,210
No!

257
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,970
You, on the ground.

258
00:30:13,050 --> 00:30:14,650
This is the police.

259
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,930
Put down your weapons.

260
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,770
Hands on your head.

261
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:21,650
Another time, Highlander!
I will find you!

262
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:24,650
Hold it right there!

263
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,410
Come back here!

264
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,730
Stop!

265
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:32,170
Wait!

266
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,610
Who was that?

267
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,050
He called you Highlander.

268
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,010
"There can be only one"?

269
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,410
Only one what?

270
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:41,330
- I want to know!
- Shut up!

271
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,170
Don't you ever
follow me again.

272
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,610
You only have one life.

273
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:49,610
If you value it...
go home.

274
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:02,890
You saw the wound.

275
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,770
He should have died.

276
00:31:04,810 --> 00:31:07,690
I say he's got
the devil in him.

277
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,210
Drinking with us, are you?

278
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,810
What's the matter, Dugal?

279
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,410
You, talking
and breathing...

280
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,530
and last night,
all but a corpse.

281
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,210
How did you manage that?

282
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,410
You'd rather I was dead?

283
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,330
It's not natural.

284
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,130
He's in league with Lucifer.

285
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,130
Don't say that, Kate.

286
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,970
I'll say it.

287
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,130
You've the devil in you.

288
00:31:54,210 --> 00:31:57,170
We've been kinsmen 20 years.

289
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,650
Connor Macleod was my kinsman.

290
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:02,890
I don't know who you are.

291
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,370
Angus.

292
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,290
You better go, Connor.

293
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:16,050
I'm not going anywhere.

294
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,210
He's the devil!
Kill him!

295
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:19,330
Lucifer!

296
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,930
Burn the devil out of him!

297
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:39,170
All right.
Get him down.

298
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,370
Burn him!

299
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:43,250
Leave him be!

300
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:44,530
Dugal...

301
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:46,410
Oh!

302
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,450
He's your cousin, man!

303
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:59,330
No, Angus!

304
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,370
Quiet!

305
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,890
Quiet!

306
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:04,970
There'll be no burning
here today!

307
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,530
We'll banish him!

308
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,210
No! Burn him!

309
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,610
Stop it, Kate!

310
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:12,090
Burn him!

311
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:15,530
Angus, burn him!

312
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:16,690
Can you walk?

313
00:33:16,770 --> 00:33:18,690
I'll bloody well
walk out of here.

314
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:21,410
Then go!
While there's still time.

315
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:25,330
I'll not forget you, Angus.

316
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:31,010
That's a good dog.

317
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:41,770
Pie and ale.
Do you want it?

318
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,210
Aye. Right now.

319
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:47,570
You filthy sod!
You're all muck and muscle.

320
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:51,250
Aye, blossom.
The way you like it.

321
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:14,690
You can do that to me
forever, my lord.

322
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,290
Will you, Connor?

323
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,890
Aye, blossom. I will.

324
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,410
Greetings.

325
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:39,890
I am Juan Sanchez
Villa-Lobos Ramirez...

326
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:43,970
chief metallurgist
to King Charles V of Spain...

327
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,330
and I'm at your service.

328
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,810
Who?

329
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:53,730
What do you want?

330
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,370
You.

331
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,650
You're Connor Macleod.

332
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:01,290
Maybe I am and--

333
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:04,410
You're Connor Macleod,
wounded in battle...

334
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:08,290
and driven from your village
five years ago.

335
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,970
Connor!

336
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:13,330
Heather, go in the house.

337
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:14,810
I'll stay right here.

338
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,850
Do as I say, woman!

339
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:35,450
The sensation you're feeling
is the quickening.

340
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,490
Who are you?

341
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,010
We are the same, Macleod!

342
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:44,450
We are brothers!

343
00:37:50,210 --> 00:37:53,450
I knew you guys
were bottle-fed.

344
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:58,730
Well, there's not a lot
I can do about it, pal.

345
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:01,130
See what I'm up against?

346
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:04,370
His Vietnamese neighbor
ate his dog.

347
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,730
Uh...
that's confidential.

348
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:08,570
How are things
in forensics?

349
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:10,890
Dull. How about lunch?

350
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:13,770
Lunch? It's a good idea.
Who pays?

351
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,930
Me.

352
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:16,370
You're on.

353
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,290
By the way, Frank...

354
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,650
the hairs in the Moretti case...

355
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,130
matched up.

356
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:24,130
Oh, I forgot my purse.

357
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,970
I'll meet you outside.

358
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:30,010
Garfield, Brenda and I
are going to lunch.

359
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,410
Sometimes, Macleod...

360
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:17,410
the sharpest blade is not enough.

361
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:28,530
# B-A-L-A-N-C-E
Balance ##

362
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:30,530
I don't like boats!
I don't like water!

363
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,370
I'm a man, not a fish.

364
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,410
Oh, you complain endlessly.

365
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:39,090
You look like a woman,
you stupid haggis.

366
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,610
Haggis? What is haggis?

367
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,770
Sheep's stomach stuffed
with meat and barley.

368
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:45,370
And what do you
do with it?

369
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:47,050
You eat it.

370
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,330
How revolting.

371
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:52,970
Be still.
You'll tip us over!

372
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:53,970
So?

373
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,650
I cannot swim,
you Spanish peacock.

374
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,090
I'm not Spanish.
I'm Egyptian.

375
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,050
You said you were
from Spain! Liar!

376
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,370
You have the manners
of a goat...

377
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:07,690
and you smell like dung.

378
00:40:07,770 --> 00:40:10,930
And you have no knowledge
whatsoever of your potential.

379
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,770
Now, get out!

380
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:13,930
No!

381
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,330
Help!

382
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:18,810
Help! Help!

383
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,650
Help!

384
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,530
Help me, I'm drowning!

385
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:27,370
You can't drown, you fool.
You're immortal!

386
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:32,610
I'm drowning!
Come help!

387
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:38,650
# We ask you...
Heavenly Father ##

388
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:42,450
I'm alive.

389
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,810
I can breathe.

390
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,530
I'll slice you in half.

391
00:41:32,610 --> 00:41:33,570
Hah!

392
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,330
Crude and slow, clansman.

393
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:40,210
Your attack was no better
than that of a clumsy child.

394
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:52,010
This cannot be.
It's the devil's work.

395
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:58,850
You cannot die, Macleod.
Accept it.

396
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,970
I hate you.

397
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:05,930
Good.

398
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,050
That is a perfect
way to start.

399
00:42:09,930 --> 00:42:10,850
Tell me...

400
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:12,970
how did it happen,
for God's sake?

401
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:19,170
Why does the sun
come up, hmm?

402
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:23,130
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night?

403
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,010
Who knows?

404
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:26,770
What I do know is...

405
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,570
because you were
born different...

406
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:32,930
men will fear you,
try to drive you away...

407
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,170
Iike the people
of your village.

408
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:49,370
You must learn to conceal
your special gift...

409
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,250
and harness your power...

410
00:42:51,330 --> 00:42:54,290
until the time
of the gathering.

411
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,530
What gathering?

412
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:01,290
When only a few of us
are left...

413
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,050
we will feel
an irresistible pull...

414
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:06,290
towards a faraway land...

415
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,290
to fight for the prize.

416
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:12,890
Come on!

417
00:43:13,890 --> 00:43:15,410
Faster!

418
00:43:24,450 --> 00:43:26,370
Never lose your temper.

419
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:29,650
If your head comes away
from your neck...

420
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:31,130
it's over.

421
00:43:55,170 --> 00:43:57,970
Never overextend
your thrust.

422
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,330
You're vulnerable and...

423
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:02,170
off balance.

424
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:04,290
Connor! Ha ha ha!

425
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,610
Heather, please.

426
00:44:19,250 --> 00:44:24,690
If it came down to us two,
would you take my head?

427
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:31,050
We must fight
until only one remains.

428
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:34,370
You are safe only on holy ground.

429
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:37,890
None of us will violate that law.

430
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:39,450
It's tradition.

431
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:53,730
Now for the last.

432
00:44:53,770 --> 00:44:56,290
Trust me.

433
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:02,370
Let yourself
feel the stag.

434
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:07,050
His heart...

435
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,610
beating.

436
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:18,330
His blood...coursing.

437
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:20,290
Feel?

438
00:45:21,450 --> 00:45:22,770
Come on!

439
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:25,730
I feel him.

440
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:28,210
Macleod, come on!

441
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:29,690
I feel him!

442
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,450
Come on!

443
00:45:31,530 --> 00:45:33,810
Ha ha ha!

444
00:45:33,890 --> 00:45:36,530
I feel him!

445
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,890
Come on, haggis!

446
00:45:46,210 --> 00:45:48,210
Macleod.

447
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,450
This is the quickening.

448
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,370
Yeah!

449
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:26,490
Now, pendejo...

450
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:30,410
shall we see what sort of
swordsman you've become?

451
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:32,170
En garde!

452
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,490
Very good.

453
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:02,250
Give me your hand, brother.

454
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:19,770
That one there.

455
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,850
How much is it?

456
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,090
Put him in.

457
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,370
But what I want is a family.

458
00:47:42,410 --> 00:47:44,730
You cannot have a family.

459
00:47:44,810 --> 00:47:47,130
We cannot have children.

460
00:47:47,210 --> 00:47:49,410
That won't please Heather.

461
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:52,330
I'll tell you that
for nothing.

462
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,930
He's full of life.

463
00:47:56,330 --> 00:47:57,850
Connor!

464
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:02,170
Here's dinner!

465
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,410
I'll be off now.

466
00:48:05,450 --> 00:48:07,930
I fancy buying
a new dress.

467
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:15,050
Oh, you little devils!
Go on!

468
00:48:16,290 --> 00:48:17,930
She's beautiful.

469
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,610
You must leave her,
brother.

470
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:35,090
Macleod.

471
00:48:35,170 --> 00:48:37,930
I was born 2,437 years ago.

472
00:48:38,010 --> 00:48:41,290
In that time,
I've had three wives.

473
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:44,650
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

474
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:48,170
Her father, Masamune, a genius...

475
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:50,410
made this for me...

476
00:48:50,490 --> 00:48:53,130
in 593 B.C.

477
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:58,130
It is the only one
of its kind...

478
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,050
Iike his daughter.

479
00:49:00,130 --> 00:49:03,250
When Shakiko died,
I was shattered.

480
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,090
I would save you
that pain.

481
00:49:06,130 --> 00:49:08,970
Please.
Let Heather go.

482
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,530
When we first met,
you felt ill, remember?

483
00:49:30,610 --> 00:49:32,810
That wasn't the first time...

484
00:49:32,850 --> 00:49:35,650
you felt
that sensation, was it?

485
00:49:35,730 --> 00:49:37,090
No.

486
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,530
When the Macleods
fought the Frazers...

487
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:42,010
and a black knight...

488
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,170
I felt it then.

489
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,570
Only it was more painful.

490
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,970
That black knight
was the Kurgan.

491
00:49:49,050 --> 00:49:52,010
It's because of him
that I sought you out.

492
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:55,210
Who is the Kurgan?

493
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,130
Where does
he come from?

494
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:59,210
The Kurgans were
an ancient people...

495
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:00,850
from the steppes
of Russia.

496
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,570
For amusement,
they tossed children...

497
00:50:02,610 --> 00:50:06,330
into pits with hungry dogs
to fight for meat.

498
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:07,770
The Kurgan.

499
00:50:07,850 --> 00:50:10,850
He is the strongest
of the immortals.

500
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:13,170
He is the perfect warrior.

501
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:15,650
If he wins the prize...

502
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:19,530
mortal man would suffer
an eternity of darkness.

503
00:50:19,570 --> 00:50:21,930
How do you fight
such a savage?

504
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:26,490
Hmm. With heart,
faith, and steel.

505
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,050
In the end,
there can be only one.

506
00:50:34,810 --> 00:50:37,050
very dangerous for you.

507
00:50:37,130 --> 00:50:39,490
Well, I was very much in love...

508
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:40,730
with her, my dear.

509
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:43,650
She was the only thing
on my mind.

510
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,930
So, holding the rose
in my teeth...

511
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:49,330
I climbed up on the rooftop,
lowered a rope...

512
00:50:49,410 --> 00:50:51,610
and swung in
through the open window.

513
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,250
Unfortunately, the lady
was no longer there.

514
00:50:57,290 --> 00:50:58,650
What did you do?

515
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,090
I introduced myself...

516
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:02,490
to the lady that was there.

517
00:51:02,570 --> 00:51:04,010
She was most helpful.

518
00:51:06,250 --> 00:51:09,090
Would you like
some more wine?

519
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:11,170
Yes, please.

520
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,890
Heather.

521
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:24,290
Get out!

522
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:25,890
What's wrong?

523
00:51:31,050 --> 00:51:33,290
Get out!

524
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:36,450
Kurgan!

525
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:39,650
Ramirez!

526
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:45,050
Raah!

527
00:51:48,650 --> 00:51:52,010
The Highlander,
where is he?

528
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:53,290
You're too late.

529
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,250
I've prepared him
for you.

530
00:51:55,330 --> 00:51:56,810
You waste your time!

531
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,130
It hurts?

532
00:52:36,330 --> 00:52:40,330
Now you die!

533
00:52:42,890 --> 00:52:46,890
I am the strongest!

534
00:52:46,970 --> 00:52:49,810
My cut has improved
your voice.

535
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,930
Yes!

536
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:01,570
Hurts?

537
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:07,210
Who is the woman?

538
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,250
Oh! She's mine!

539
00:55:11,770 --> 00:55:14,290
Not for much longer.

540
00:55:23,490 --> 00:55:26,090
Tonight you sleep
in hell!

541
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:28,770
There can be only one!

542
00:56:13,570 --> 00:56:16,490
Hello, pretty.

543
00:56:26,490 --> 00:56:28,450
I'd like to speak
to Russell Nash.

544
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:31,370
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Nash isn't here.

545
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:34,010
May I call him at home?

546
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,850
That won't be possible.

547
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:37,850
Good morning.

548
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:40,730
This is Brenda Wyatt,
Mr. Nash.

549
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,650
We've already met, Rachel.

550
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:46,090
What can I do for you?

551
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:47,530
I'd like some advice.

552
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:50,330
Are you someone
who takes advice?

553
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,810
That depends.

554
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:53,330
Advice about what?

555
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,770
What can you tell me
about a seven-foot lunatic...

556
00:56:55,850 --> 00:56:57,410
hacking away with a broadsword...

557
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,930
at one in the morning,
New York City, 1985?

558
00:57:02,370 --> 00:57:04,130
Not much.

559
00:57:04,170 --> 00:57:06,850
A Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C...

560
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:09,290
the metal folded 200 times?

561
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,010
I don't deal
in exotic weapons.

562
00:57:12,090 --> 00:57:15,570
May I show you something
in 18th-century silver?

563
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:19,490
That's not why I came.
You know it.

564
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,130
Do you cook?

565
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,490
Why?

566
00:57:22,530 --> 00:57:25,530
I thought
we might have dinner.

567
00:57:25,570 --> 00:57:27,210
Did you?

568
00:57:27,290 --> 00:57:28,370
Yes.

569
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:33,050
So I'm standing there,
and there's Brenda.

570
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,250
Our little Brenda.

571
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:37,970
You're sure it was Brenda?

572
00:57:38,050 --> 00:57:41,730
She was in Nash's shop
talking to him.

573
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:51,330
What are you
looking at, Rachel?

574
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:53,890
The eyes in the back of your head.

575
00:57:56,210 --> 00:57:58,570
People are asking
about you.

576
00:57:58,610 --> 00:58:00,690
What am I supposed to say?

577
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:04,170
Tell them I'm immortal.

578
00:58:39,690 --> 00:58:41,410
Quiet.

579
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,330
Don't be frightened.

580
00:58:48,410 --> 00:58:50,850
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

581
00:58:50,930 --> 00:58:54,410
- What happened?
- Everybody's dead.

582
00:58:57,810 --> 00:58:59,810
I'm like you.
I'm alone.

583
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:01,570
Come with me, Rachel.

584
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:18,250
You're alive.
Why didn't you die?

585
00:59:18,330 --> 00:59:20,450
Hey. It's a kind of magic.

586
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:28,570
- Move!
- Nein!

587
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:32,570
Heh heh heh.
Whatever you say, Jack.

588
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,170
You're the master race.

589
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:39,930
Let's go.

590
00:59:41,930 --> 00:59:44,570
That was a long time ago.

591
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:48,170
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

592
00:59:48,210 --> 00:59:50,530
You can't hide
your feelings from me.

593
00:59:50,610 --> 00:59:52,770
I've known you too long.

594
00:59:52,810 --> 00:59:54,370
What feelings?

595
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:56,170
How about loneliness?

596
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:58,730
I'm not lonely.

597
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:01,530
I've got everything
I need right here.

598
01:00:01,610 --> 01:00:03,130
Oh, no, you don't.

599
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:08,250
You refuse to let
anyone love you.

600
01:00:08,290 --> 01:00:10,410
Love is for poets.

601
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:17,330
You're such
a romantic, Rachel.

602
01:00:17,410 --> 01:00:20,290
You always were.

603
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:42,970
Just a minute.

604
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:02,970
Good evening.

605
01:01:07,050 --> 01:01:09,370
You want to dine
in the hall...

606
01:01:09,410 --> 01:01:11,130
or shall we step inside?

607
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,930
Ohh.

608
01:01:12,970 --> 01:01:14,170
Come in.

609
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:17,450
May I take your coat?

610
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:18,570
What? No, thanks.

611
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:20,490
I'll hold on to it.

612
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:22,090
Oh, fine.

613
01:01:25,410 --> 01:01:26,730
Where are you going?

614
01:01:26,810 --> 01:01:28,930
I forgot my earrings.

615
01:01:28,970 --> 01:01:30,810
Make yourself a drink.

616
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:33,850
There are glasses in the bar.

617
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:46,530
You know what you're doing?

618
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,810
I like your place, Brenda.

619
01:02:08,890 --> 01:02:13,050
I've been here three months.
Still fixing it up.

620
01:02:16,730 --> 01:02:18,770
Interesting view.

621
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,770
What did you say?

622
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,170
I said, "lnteresting view"!

623
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,850
Isn't it great?

624
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:37,330
You never told me...

625
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:40,250
what you do
for a living.

626
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:44,890
I work for
the Metropolitan Museum...

627
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,570
in acquisitions.

628
01:02:47,650 --> 01:02:50,610
Huh. That explains
your interest...

629
01:02:50,690 --> 01:02:52,930
in ancient weapons.

630
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:56,170
Right.

631
01:02:57,690 --> 01:03:00,610
Especially the samurai.

632
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:02,130
Very nice.

633
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:04,450
Shall we have a toast?

634
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,970
Yes.

635
01:03:10,770 --> 01:03:12,650
Brandy.

636
01:03:12,730 --> 01:03:15,250
Bottled in 1783.

637
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:17,450
Wow. That's old.

638
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:23,330
1783 was a very good year.

639
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,050
Mozart wrote
his great mass.

640
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:29,570
The Montgolfier Brothers went up...

641
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:32,450
in their first balloon.

642
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,610
And England recognized...

643
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,970
the independence
of the United States.

644
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,370
Is that right?

645
01:03:43,410 --> 01:03:44,690
Yes.

646
01:03:51,930 --> 01:03:53,410
What's that?

647
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,370
It's for you.

648
01:03:55,450 --> 01:03:56,930
Can I open it?

649
01:03:57,010 --> 01:03:58,650
If you like.

650
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:13,290
You bastard.

651
01:04:13,370 --> 01:04:15,210
Where did you find this?

652
01:04:15,290 --> 01:04:17,290
I have an extensive library.

653
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,050
Odd thing.

654
01:04:20,130 --> 01:04:22,410
Your bio doesn't
mention the Met.

655
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,810
It says you work
for the police...

656
01:04:24,890 --> 01:04:26,570
in forensics.

657
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:28,650
Are you and Moran
setting me up?

658
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:30,610
I don't work for Moran.

659
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,970
Then why is that bald policeman...

660
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:35,370
sitting outside
watching your apartment?

661
01:04:37,090 --> 01:04:38,290
You remember him.

662
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,650
Moran's had him tailing me.

663
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,730
What are you going to do?

664
01:04:41,810 --> 01:04:44,370
Question is,
what are you going to do?

665
01:04:44,450 --> 01:04:47,010
Turn off the tape or
shoot me with the .45?

666
01:04:50,490 --> 01:04:52,330
I'm not looking
for a killer.

667
01:04:52,410 --> 01:04:53,770
I'm looking for a sword.

668
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,730
The one used on Fasil.

669
01:04:55,810 --> 01:04:58,490
- I only want to see the samurai.
- Why?

670
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:00,450
Because it's not
supposed to exist.

671
01:05:00,530 --> 01:05:02,570
I dated the blade
at 600 B.C.

672
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:04,850
The metal had been
folded 200 times.

673
01:05:04,930 --> 01:05:08,250
The Japanese didn't make swords
like that till the Middle Ages.

674
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:10,530
So where the hell
did it come from?

675
01:05:10,570 --> 01:05:12,450
If I could verify
its existence...

676
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:14,850
it would be like
discovering a 747...

677
01:05:14,890 --> 01:05:17,770
a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

678
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:20,170
This is crazy.

679
01:05:20,210 --> 01:05:22,690
Wait a minute, Nash.
I want some answers.

680
01:05:24,490 --> 01:05:26,410
You want?

681
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:28,770
Don't you ever
think about anything...

682
01:05:28,810 --> 01:05:30,370
except what you want?

683
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,170
You must leave her, brother.

684
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:57,730
# There's no time for us #

685
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:04,930
# There's no place for us #

686
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:13,130
# What is this thing
that fills our dreams #

687
01:06:13,210 --> 01:06:17,770
# Yet slips away from us? #

688
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:27,290
# Who wants to live forever? #

689
01:06:27,370 --> 01:06:34,010
# Who wants to live forever? #

690
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,290
# There's no chance for us #

691
01:06:45,370 --> 01:06:52,090
# It's all decided for us #

692
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:59,490
# This world has
only one sweet moment #

693
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:03,410
# Set aside for us #

694
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:04,930
Heather!

695
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:12,930
# Who wants to live forever? #

696
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:20,090
# Who wants to live forever? #

697
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,170
Heather!

698
01:07:23,850 --> 01:07:26,530
Connor, I'm here!

699
01:07:29,290 --> 01:07:36,450
# Who dares to love forever #

700
01:07:41,610 --> 01:07:44,570
# When love must die? ##

701
01:07:47,050 --> 01:07:49,410
My beautiful man.

702
01:07:49,450 --> 01:07:51,330
My husband.

703
01:07:51,370 --> 01:07:54,370
I am that, my love.

704
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,330
I've never really known...

705
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:02,930
What?

706
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:06,770
Why you stayed.

707
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:11,410
Because I love you
as much now...

708
01:08:11,490 --> 01:08:14,290
as the first day we met.

709
01:08:14,370 --> 01:08:16,850
And I love you.

710
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,890
I don't want to die.

711
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:28,210
I want to stay
with you forever.

712
01:08:28,290 --> 01:08:30,130
I want that too.

713
01:08:30,210 --> 01:08:33,650
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

714
01:08:35,970 --> 01:08:37,330
What, lass?

715
01:08:37,410 --> 01:08:41,170
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

716
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:44,170
and remember me
on my birthday?

717
01:08:44,250 --> 01:08:48,690
Aye, love. I will.

718
01:08:48,770 --> 01:08:52,290
I wanted to have
your children.

719
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:56,410
They would have been
strong and fine.

720
01:09:00,450 --> 01:09:02,810
Don't see me, Connor.

721
01:09:02,850 --> 01:09:05,490
Let me die in peace.

722
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,170
Where are we?

723
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:19,090
We're in the highlands.

724
01:09:20,890 --> 01:09:22,930
Where else?

725
01:09:25,690 --> 01:09:28,170
Running down a mountainside.

726
01:09:41,530 --> 01:09:43,690
The sun is shining.

727
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:46,410
It's not cold.

728
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:51,130
You've got your sheepskins on...

729
01:09:53,210 --> 01:09:56,770
and the boots
I made for you.

730
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,530
Good night,
my bonny Heather.

731
01:10:17,170 --> 01:10:19,650
Hey! Kastagir.

732
01:10:20,490 --> 01:10:23,810
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

733
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:26,690
It seems like 100 years.

734
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:29,250
It's been 100 years.

735
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,530
How have you been?

736
01:10:40,290 --> 01:10:42,570
Hey, this...

737
01:10:42,650 --> 01:10:46,330
puts hairs on your chest.

738
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:50,210
What is it?

739
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:51,530
Boom-boom.

740
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:53,090
Big strong man like you...

741
01:10:53,130 --> 01:10:55,730
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

742
01:10:55,810 --> 01:10:58,730
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

743
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:00,490
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

744
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:05,730
So...
the gathering is here.

745
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:09,810
Time's almost
caught us, friend.

746
01:11:09,890 --> 01:11:12,690
Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

747
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:17,170
I think we should
have a party.

748
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:20,290
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

749
01:11:20,370 --> 01:11:21,330
Really?

750
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:22,810
When exactly was that?

751
01:11:22,850 --> 01:11:24,690
It was 1783.

752
01:11:24,770 --> 01:11:27,290
1783.

753
01:11:27,330 --> 01:11:28,690
Oh, yes.

754
01:11:28,770 --> 01:11:31,090
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

755
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:32,530
You were drunk.

756
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:34,930
What was that guy's name again?

757
01:11:35,010 --> 01:11:36,410
His name was Bassett.

758
01:11:36,450 --> 01:11:37,770
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

759
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:38,770
I implore you.

760
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:42,250
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.

761
01:11:42,330 --> 01:11:44,490
See if the imbecile is ready.

762
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:46,890
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

763
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,730
Tell him I'm ready.

764
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:51,450
Christ! I've gone blind.

765
01:11:52,370 --> 01:11:54,170
En garde, sir.

766
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,130
Wonderful, sir.

767
01:11:59,210 --> 01:12:00,930
Thank you, Hotchkiss.

768
01:12:01,010 --> 01:12:02,650
Bassett?

769
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,850
That you?

770
01:12:04,930 --> 01:12:06,970
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

771
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,490
The sword, the sword.

772
01:12:26,610 --> 01:12:28,290
Stop, sir.

773
01:12:28,330 --> 01:12:30,450
I beseech you.

774
01:12:30,530 --> 01:12:33,250
I apologize for
calling your wife...

775
01:12:33,290 --> 01:12:35,650
a bloated warthog--

776
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,610
And I bid you good day.

777
01:12:40,450 --> 01:12:41,730
Shoot him, sir.

778
01:12:41,770 --> 01:12:42,650
Shoot him.

779
01:12:42,690 --> 01:12:44,730
Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!

780
01:12:44,810 --> 01:12:47,690
Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss!
Stop it!

781
01:12:48,890 --> 01:12:50,890
# Hotchkiss #

782
01:12:50,970 --> 01:12:51,890
What?

783
01:12:51,970 --> 01:12:52,810
No, sir.

784
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:55,210
No, no...

785
01:12:55,290 --> 01:12:57,170
No! No! No!

786
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:04,010
That's the mood
of New York now.

787
01:13:04,090 --> 01:13:05,930
Get out of here!

788
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:07,250
So far...

789
01:13:14,010 --> 01:13:16,330
Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure...

790
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:18,730
the mayor's office issued
the following statement...

791
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:20,250
Give us a drink, pal.

792
01:13:20,330 --> 01:13:22,610
Got a joint?

793
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,010
...vigorous investigation...

794
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,890
following up on
some promising leads.

795
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:30,250
Hey, Rockefeller,
how'd you like Candy?

796
01:13:30,330 --> 01:13:33,930
She said you were
kind of kinky, huh?

797
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:37,090
Don't ever speak to me.

798
01:13:38,970 --> 01:13:41,290
I didn't mean nothin'.

799
01:13:41,370 --> 01:13:43,370
Look, I didn't mean--

800
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:49,650
Don't ever speak
to me again.

801
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,770
Do you understand?

802
01:13:52,690 --> 01:13:53,730
Yeah.

803
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,170
Good.

804
01:13:58,690 --> 01:14:03,010
I hope you get your head
chopped off, asshole.

805
01:14:05,290 --> 01:14:06,690
And you!

806
01:14:06,730 --> 01:14:07,970
Shut it!

807
01:14:11,570 --> 01:14:13,650
# Here we stand #

808
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:16,250
# And here we fall #

809
01:14:16,330 --> 01:14:19,130
# History won't care at all #

810
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:20,730
# Lay on the bed #

811
01:14:20,810 --> 01:14:23,050
# Put out the light #

812
01:14:23,130 --> 01:14:26,610
# ...won't be home tonight, yeah #

813
01:14:26,690 --> 01:14:29,490
# We don't waste no time at all... #

814
01:14:29,570 --> 01:14:32,010
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

815
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,330
# Comes to you... #

816
01:14:35,410 --> 01:14:39,330
# Ahh, we just waited
for another... ##

817
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:41,090
What the hell?

818
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:57,010
Okay, marine,
this is for real!

819
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,530
Yah!

820
01:15:02,610 --> 01:15:03,610
Let's go!

821
01:15:06,810 --> 01:15:10,010
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

822
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:24,490
What the hell
is going on?

823
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,010
Ahh!

824
01:15:51,010 --> 01:15:53,650
Is somebody trapped
in there?

825
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,290
For God's sake!

826
01:17:15,730 --> 01:17:19,130
Ooo!

827
01:17:26,490 --> 01:17:27,810
Look at that!

828
01:18:03,890 --> 01:18:05,850
Mother of God.

829
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,330
Mom.

830
01:18:15,650 --> 01:18:18,930
Hey, where are you
going with my car?

831
01:18:19,010 --> 01:18:22,170
Daddy, help me! Daddy!
Daddy, help me!

832
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:23,090
Help, Daddy!

833
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,770
Daddy, help me!

834
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:31,930
Frank, take it easy.

835
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,890
I checked everywhere.

836
01:18:33,930 --> 01:18:35,810
There aren't any witnesses.

837
01:18:35,850 --> 01:18:38,570
That's New York for you.

838
01:18:38,610 --> 01:18:41,050
Twenty people standing around.
Nobody saw a thing.

839
01:18:41,130 --> 01:18:43,810
Tell me about Matunas.
Is he on drugs?

840
01:18:43,850 --> 01:18:45,210
He's a survival nut.

841
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:46,690
What?

842
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:48,610
He was a marine.

843
01:18:48,650 --> 01:18:51,450
His ex-c.o. said
he was paranoid...

844
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:54,330
but he was a good man.

845
01:18:54,410 --> 01:18:56,250
How you doing, kid?

846
01:18:56,330 --> 01:18:58,810
Okay, for a guy who got three feet
of steel crammed through his gut.

847
01:18:58,890 --> 01:19:00,290
How you doing?

848
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:03,970
I understand
you saw who stuck you?

849
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:05,730
You kidding me, man?

850
01:19:05,770 --> 01:19:07,370
Is that him?

851
01:19:07,450 --> 01:19:08,610
Nope.

852
01:19:08,690 --> 01:19:11,450
Quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley.

853
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:13,810
The freak was trying to kill me!

854
01:19:13,890 --> 01:19:17,210
He had a scar
across his neck.

855
01:19:17,250 --> 01:19:19,090
That ain't him.

856
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:20,730
Shit.

857
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:24,450
Depressed?

858
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:25,890
Yeah.

859
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:28,930
You don't know grunt
about depressed.

860
01:19:29,010 --> 01:19:31,290
I got me a .357.

861
01:19:31,370 --> 01:19:33,690
Got me a trunk load
of shotguns.

862
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:35,770
I got three big-bore
battle rifles...

863
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:36,810
ammo up the ass...

864
01:19:36,890 --> 01:19:38,650
and I ain't safe!

865
01:19:38,730 --> 01:19:40,250
I can't protect myself!

866
01:19:40,330 --> 01:19:42,170
Okay, take it easy, pal.

867
01:19:42,250 --> 01:19:44,050
That weirdo, man.

868
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:47,050
He got up after I put
enough lead in him...

869
01:19:47,130 --> 01:19:48,490
to drop a rhino.

870
01:19:48,570 --> 01:19:50,770
Hey, listen,
could you work...

871
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:52,770
with one of our artists?

872
01:19:52,850 --> 01:19:55,170
Get a picture of this guy?

873
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,250
Sure, sure.

874
01:19:57,330 --> 01:20:00,290
Thanks.
Take it easy, pal.

875
01:20:00,330 --> 01:20:01,810
Hey, cop.

876
01:20:01,890 --> 01:20:02,850
Yeah.

877
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:05,530
I know you guys
think I'm nuts...

878
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:08,450
but there's something else
I gotta tell you.

879
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:11,810
After he threw me
against the wall--

880
01:20:30,530 --> 01:20:32,290
This is like
"One Step Beyond".

881
01:20:32,330 --> 01:20:34,810
All we got is an eyewitness.

882
01:20:34,890 --> 01:20:37,090
Don't say anything
about sword fights...

883
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,090
or guys glowing in the dark
for Christ's sake.

884
01:20:40,570 --> 01:20:42,090
Hey, Moran!

885
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:44,010
Have you read this?

886
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:48,010
Are you kidding?
You know cops can't read.

887
01:20:48,090 --> 01:20:50,730
What does "incompetent" mean?

888
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:52,170
That mayor.

889
01:20:52,250 --> 01:20:56,050
He calls me at 2:00
in the morning.

890
01:20:56,130 --> 01:20:58,890
I don't answer
the phone anymore.

891
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:01,650
What does "baffled" mean?

892
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:34,850
Karen Joan Nash.

893
01:21:34,930 --> 01:21:37,730
Yeah, I remember her.

894
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:40,130
I was practicing
in Syracuse.

895
01:21:40,210 --> 01:21:42,530
Didn't get many of these.

896
01:21:42,570 --> 01:21:44,010
What?

897
01:21:44,050 --> 01:21:45,410
Unwed mothers.

898
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:47,970
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

899
01:21:48,010 --> 01:21:50,930
Back then, in Syracuse...

900
01:21:51,010 --> 01:21:53,570
that was a stoning offense.

901
01:21:53,650 --> 01:21:55,170
What happened?

902
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:58,330
She had the baby,
and she died.

903
01:21:58,410 --> 01:21:59,770
So Nash was illegitimate.

904
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,330
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he was illegitimate...

905
01:22:02,410 --> 01:22:04,730
for about a minute and a half.

906
01:22:04,810 --> 01:22:07,010
He died right after she did.

907
01:22:11,170 --> 01:22:12,850
He died.

908
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:23,730
Hello, Brenda.

909
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:25,650
I did what you asked.

910
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:29,370
I went through the deeds
to Nash's house...

911
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,770
back through
five previous owners...

912
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:34,690
to the original guy,
Montague, in 1796.

913
01:22:34,850 --> 01:22:36,130
In all five instances...

914
01:22:36,210 --> 01:22:37,210
Montague through Nash...

915
01:22:37,290 --> 01:22:38,690
I found a death certificate...

916
01:22:38,730 --> 01:22:40,730
for a kid with the same name...

917
01:22:40,810 --> 01:22:42,250
who died at birth...

918
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:45,650
years before he pretended to sign
for his inheritance.

919
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:48,810
Jesus, Rick, isn't there
any heat in here?

920
01:22:48,890 --> 01:22:51,530
No. Heat's bad
for the circuits.

921
01:22:51,610 --> 01:22:53,970
In case
there's any doubt...

922
01:23:13,450 --> 01:23:15,530
So, what you've
got here, Brenda...

923
01:23:15,610 --> 01:23:18,450
is a guy who's been
creeping around...

924
01:23:18,530 --> 01:23:20,050
since at least 1700...

925
01:23:20,130 --> 01:23:22,450
pretending to croak
every so often.

926
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,890
Leaving all his goods...

927
01:23:23,970 --> 01:23:26,330
to kids who've been
corpses for years...

928
01:23:26,370 --> 01:23:28,690
and assuming
their identities.

929
01:23:33,850 --> 01:23:37,810
It's not possible.

930
01:23:37,890 --> 01:23:39,290
"Post" final!

931
01:23:39,370 --> 01:23:41,570
Cops release
headhunter picture!

932
01:23:41,610 --> 01:23:43,010
Reward offered.

933
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:43,970
I'll take a "Post."

934
01:23:44,050 --> 01:23:45,610
Headhunter revealed!

935
01:24:17,890 --> 01:24:21,170
For you, my bonny Heather.

936
01:24:21,250 --> 01:24:23,170
Happy birthday.

937
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:28,850
And you, Juan Ramirez.

938
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:32,410
Take care of her,
you overdressed haggis.

939
01:25:07,330 --> 01:25:09,690
Kastagir is gone.

940
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:12,130
Only you and I remain.

941
01:25:19,210 --> 01:25:22,130
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

942
01:25:22,210 --> 01:25:24,210
Who cuts your hair?

943
01:25:24,290 --> 01:25:27,410
I am in disguise.

944
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:31,090
This way no one
will recognize me.

945
01:25:33,410 --> 01:25:34,690
I do.

946
01:25:36,130 --> 01:25:38,010
What do you want?

947
01:25:38,090 --> 01:25:40,330
Your head.

948
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:42,210
And the prize.

949
01:25:43,210 --> 01:25:46,410
Watch.

950
01:25:46,490 --> 01:25:49,370
Happy Halloween, ladies!

951
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:00,530
Nuns. No sense of humor.

952
01:26:00,610 --> 01:26:04,810
Ramirez's blade did not
cut deeply enough.

953
01:26:04,850 --> 01:26:08,330
He was right about you.
You're slime.

954
01:26:08,410 --> 01:26:10,530
Ramirez was an effete snob!

955
01:26:10,610 --> 01:26:12,890
He died on his knees!

956
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:16,770
I took his head
and raped his woman...

957
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:19,970
before his blood
was even cold!

958
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:29,730
I see.

959
01:26:29,770 --> 01:26:32,730
Ramirez lied.

960
01:26:35,090 --> 01:26:37,890
She was not his woman.

961
01:26:37,970 --> 01:26:39,970
She was your woman...

962
01:26:40,010 --> 01:26:43,690
and she never told you.

963
01:26:43,730 --> 01:26:46,130
I wonder why.

964
01:26:46,210 --> 01:26:48,490
Perhaps I gave her something...

965
01:26:48,570 --> 01:26:50,850
you never could...

966
01:26:52,890 --> 01:26:57,090
and secretly she yearned
for my return.

967
01:26:57,130 --> 01:27:00,010
Holy ground, Highlander!

968
01:27:00,050 --> 01:27:02,690
Remember what
Ramirez taught you.

969
01:27:06,290 --> 01:27:09,730
You can't stay
in here forever.

970
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:14,370
You are weak, Highlander.

971
01:27:14,410 --> 01:27:20,050
You will always be
weaker than I.

972
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:25,610
I'll be out front.

973
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:31,530
Goodbye, Macleod.

974
01:27:31,610 --> 01:27:35,330
We will meet soon enough.

975
01:27:44,610 --> 01:27:47,250
This is the house of God.

976
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:49,490
People are trying to pray.

977
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:51,050
You're disturbing them.

978
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:57,010
He cares about
these helpless mortals?

979
01:27:57,090 --> 01:27:58,930
Of course he cares.

980
01:27:59,010 --> 01:28:01,330
He died for our sins.

981
01:28:01,410 --> 01:28:03,690
That shall be his undoing.

982
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:07,970
Father...

983
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:09,930
forgive me!

984
01:28:10,010 --> 01:28:12,850
I am a worm.

985
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:27,570
I have something to say!

986
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:29,730
It's better to burn out...

987
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:32,410
than to fade away!

988
01:28:32,490 --> 01:28:33,770
Yah!

989
01:28:40,130 --> 01:28:41,850
I need to see him, goddamn it!

990
01:28:41,930 --> 01:28:43,730
I'm afraid that's impossible.

991
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:45,610
Mr. Nash is--

992
01:28:45,690 --> 01:28:47,330
Mr. Nash is dead.

993
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:51,770
What are you doing here?

994
01:28:51,810 --> 01:28:54,330
I'm looking for
a dead guy named Nash.

995
01:28:54,370 --> 01:28:56,450
He died at birth
in Syracuse, New York.

996
01:29:00,930 --> 01:29:03,490
All right.

997
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:05,410
Come on.

998
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:33,330
Are the Claymores real?

999
01:29:34,730 --> 01:29:36,130
What is this, a museum?

1000
01:29:36,210 --> 01:29:38,610
This stuff
must be worth a fortune.

1001
01:29:47,210 --> 01:29:50,610
I've been alive
for 4 1/2 centuries.

1002
01:29:50,690 --> 01:29:52,450
I cannot die.

1003
01:29:52,530 --> 01:29:54,690
Huh.

1004
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:57,250
Well, everybody's
got their problems.

1005
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:05,570
What are you going
to do with that?

1006
01:30:05,650 --> 01:30:07,130
Take it.

1007
01:30:20,050 --> 01:30:24,130
I am Connor Macleod
of the Clan Macleod.

1008
01:30:24,170 --> 01:30:26,250
I was born in 1518...

1009
01:30:26,330 --> 01:30:28,170
in the village of Glenfinnan...

1010
01:30:28,250 --> 01:30:30,570
on the shores of Loch Shiel...

1011
01:30:30,650 --> 01:30:32,770
and I am immortal.

1012
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:09,770
You're not listening.

1013
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:11,690
Brenda, it isn't going to work.

1014
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:13,610
I can't get involved.
Not again.

1015
01:32:25,930 --> 01:32:27,810
You know what's weird?

1016
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:30,690
Most people are
afraid to die.

1017
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,090
That's not your problem.

1018
01:32:33,930 --> 01:32:35,450
You're afraid to live.

1019
01:32:40,330 --> 01:32:42,690
Take care of yourself.

1020
01:32:42,770 --> 01:32:44,290
Don't lose your head.

1021
01:32:59,530 --> 01:33:01,730
Hello, pretty.

1022
01:33:05,570 --> 01:33:08,770
Come on!
Open up!

1023
01:33:14,970 --> 01:33:17,370
Oh, my!

1024
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:40,250
Have you ever
played chicken?

1025
01:33:44,770 --> 01:33:46,570
Here we go!

1026
01:33:49,050 --> 01:33:50,930
Watch out!

1027
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:27,170
Excuse me!

1028
01:34:29,450 --> 01:34:31,170
Oh, no!

1029
01:34:48,530 --> 01:34:50,810
Watch out! A truck!

1030
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:52,770
Look out!

1031
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:11,650
# New York, New York #

1032
01:35:11,730 --> 01:35:14,810
# I want to wake up #

1033
01:35:14,850 --> 01:35:15,770
Shut up.

1034
01:35:15,810 --> 01:35:17,770
# ln the city #

1035
01:35:17,850 --> 01:35:19,490
Sing along--
# That never sleeps #

1036
01:35:19,570 --> 01:35:21,650
Shut up!

1037
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:25,730
# To find I'm king of the hill #

1038
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:28,730
Shut up!

1039
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:32,370
Shut up!

1040
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:33,890
# And #

1041
01:35:33,970 --> 01:35:36,170
# If I can #

1042
01:35:36,250 --> 01:35:38,690
# Make it there #

1043
01:35:38,730 --> 01:35:43,010
# I'll make it anywhere #

1044
01:35:43,050 --> 01:35:45,930
# It's up to you #

1045
01:35:45,970 --> 01:35:47,570
# New York #

1046
01:35:49,250 --> 01:35:51,210
# New #

1047
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:56,410
# York ##

1048
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:10,130
I can entertain myself.

1049
01:36:10,210 --> 01:36:12,730
Your friend is a real screamer.
Listen.

1050
01:36:13,930 --> 01:36:17,130
Which part should
I cut off first?

1051
01:36:17,170 --> 01:36:19,090
I'll be waiting.

1052
01:36:24,810 --> 01:36:27,650
The endless killing
has driven him mad.

1053
01:36:27,690 --> 01:36:30,050
Rachel, there are instructions
in the desk drawer.

1054
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:31,970
I want you to follow them.

1055
01:36:32,010 --> 01:36:34,370
There's a power of attorney
for you.

1056
01:36:34,410 --> 01:36:36,850
You'll have everything you need.

1057
01:36:36,930 --> 01:36:38,690
You're not coming back.

1058
01:36:39,690 --> 01:36:41,090
Even if you kill him...

1059
01:36:41,130 --> 01:36:43,450
you're not coming back...

1060
01:36:43,530 --> 01:36:44,690
are you?

1061
01:36:53,090 --> 01:36:54,930
Sweet Rachel.

1062
01:36:55,010 --> 01:36:58,610
You always knew
this would happen.

1063
01:36:58,690 --> 01:37:00,930
Russell Nash dies tonight.

1064
01:37:15,370 --> 01:37:18,730
Hey...
it's a kind of magic.

1065
01:37:26,970 --> 01:37:29,090
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

1066
01:42:34,250 --> 01:42:36,610
So now it ends.

1067
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:51,130
Yah!

1068
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:55,450
What kept you?

1069
01:45:05,290 --> 01:45:07,770
There can be only one!

1070
01:45:39,250 --> 01:45:42,050
The quickening overpowers me!

1071
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:48,730
I know!
I know everything!

1072
01:45:48,890 --> 01:45:50,970
I am everything!

1073
01:46:48,770 --> 01:46:51,330
this is where it all began.

1074
01:46:51,410 --> 01:46:54,170
Can you tell me
about the prize?

1075
01:46:54,250 --> 01:46:57,050
It's like a whirlwind
in my head.

1076
01:46:57,090 --> 01:46:58,450
But if I concentrate...

1077
01:46:58,530 --> 01:47:00,330
I know what people
are thinking...

1078
01:47:00,410 --> 01:47:01,930
all over the world.

1079
01:47:02,010 --> 01:47:03,090
Presidents...

1080
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:04,290
diplomats...

1081
01:47:04,370 --> 01:47:05,930
scientists.

1082
01:47:06,010 --> 01:47:08,810
I can help them
understand each other.

1083
01:47:09,850 --> 01:47:11,050
What am I thinking?

1084
01:47:11,130 --> 01:47:12,050
You're thinking...

1085
01:47:12,130 --> 01:47:14,930
whether or not
you can love me.

1086
01:47:15,010 --> 01:47:16,850
You can.
I'm just like you.

1087
01:47:16,930 --> 01:47:18,770
I can love and
have children.

1088
01:47:18,850 --> 01:47:20,610
Live and grow old.

1089
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:23,050
You never prepared
me for that...

1090
01:47:23,090 --> 01:47:24,450
you Spanish peacock.

1091
01:47:26,170 --> 01:47:28,170
Patience, Highlander.

1092
01:47:28,250 --> 01:47:30,450
You have done well.

1093
01:47:30,530 --> 01:47:32,570
But it'll take time.

1094
01:47:32,650 --> 01:47:37,770
You are generations
being born and dying.

1095
01:47:37,850 --> 01:47:40,170
You are at one
with all living things.

1096
01:47:40,250 --> 01:47:43,410
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

1097
01:47:44,970 --> 01:47:47,690
You have power beyond imagination.

1098
01:47:47,810 --> 01:47:50,450
Use it well, my friend.

1099
01:47:50,530 --> 01:47:52,490
Don't lose your head.

1100
01:48:30,690 --> 01:48:32,130
# One dream #

1101
01:48:32,170 --> 01:48:34,010
# One source #

1102
01:48:34,050 --> 01:48:35,810
# One prize #

1103
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:37,370
# One goal #

1104
01:48:37,450 --> 01:48:41,210
# One golden glance #

1105
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:44,570
# Of what should be #

1106
01:48:44,650 --> 01:48:47,970
# One shine of light #

1107
01:48:48,010 --> 01:48:51,770
# That shows the way #

1108
01:48:51,810 --> 01:48:55,130
# No mortal man #

1109
01:48:55,210 --> 01:48:58,970
# Can win this day #

1110
01:48:59,050 --> 01:49:02,330
# The waiting seems #

1111
01:49:02,410 --> 01:49:05,850
# Eternity #

1112
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:09,050
# The day will dawn #

1113
01:49:09,090 --> 01:49:13,090
# On sanity #

1114
01:49:13,130 --> 01:49:16,650
# Is this a kind #

1115
01:49:16,730 --> 01:49:18,690
# Of magic? #

1116
01:49:20,090 --> 01:49:25,570
# There can be only one #

1117
01:49:27,290 --> 01:49:28,690
# This rage #

1118
01:49:28,770 --> 01:49:30,770
# That lasts #

1119

1120
01:49:34,010 --> 01:49:36,930
# Will soon be done #

1121
01:49:51,770 --> 01:49:55,570
# This flame that burns #

1122
01:49:55,650 --> 01:49:58,730
# lnside of me #

1123
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:01,010
# I'm hearing #

1124
01:50:01,090 --> 01:50:06,130
# Secret harmonies #

1125
01:50:06,210 --> 01:50:07,570
# The bell #

1126
01:50:07,650 --> 01:50:09,490
# That rings #

1127
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:13,250
# Inside your mind #

1128
01:50:13,290 --> 01:50:17,090

1129
01:50:17,130 --> 01:50:20,450
