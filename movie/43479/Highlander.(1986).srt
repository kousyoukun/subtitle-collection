1
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,381
Macleod.

2
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:47,681
Fasil. Wait.

3
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,703
All right.

4
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:17,135
Macleod!

5
00:11:19,137 --> 00:11:21,139
Clan Macleod!

6
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,654
May this year
of our Lord 1536...

7
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:39,241
bring victory
to the Clan Macleod!

8
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,659
Macleod!

9
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,829
Victory to Macleod!

10
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:52,838
Hurry up! Hurry up!

11
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,051
Are you scared, Connor?

12
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,553
Ha ha ha!

13
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:02,347
No, Cousin Dugal.
I'm not!

14
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:04,266
Don't talk nonsense, man.

15
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,562
I peed my kilt the first time
I went into battle.

16
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,855
Oh, aye.

17
00:12:09,938 --> 00:12:12,274
Angus pees his kilt
all the time!

18
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,048
Connor!

19
00:12:36,882 --> 00:12:38,383
Connor, wait!

20
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,552
Wait!

21
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:44,056
Take these flowers
and think of me.

22
00:12:45,974 --> 00:12:49,686
Remember, you fight with God
on your side, Connor.

23
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,855
A girl like that
can wound a soldier...

24
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,857
more than a Frazer sword,
my friend.

25
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:56,693
Angus! You and Dugal
keep him in one piece!

26
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,488
Aye, we all know
what piece that is!

27
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,285
There is one called Connor
among them.

28
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,703
Aye.

29
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:55,294
Remember our
agreement, Murdoch.

30
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,214
The boy is mine.

31
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,216
It's begun.

32
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,303
Death to the Macleods!

33
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:07,306
Death to the Macleods!

34
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:10,392
Yay! Yay!

35
00:14:16,023 --> 00:14:17,900
Death to the Frazers!

36
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,027
Yay! Yah!

37
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,715
Macleod!

38
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,732
Come on!

39
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,651
Macleod!

40
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,615
Now you stay under.

41
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:11,620
- Forgive me... my son.

42
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:15,249
Fight me, damn you!

43
00:15:15,249 --> 00:15:16,834
Fight me, cowards!

44
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,544
No, not him!

45
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,262
Castrate the heathens!

46
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:30,430
Nobody will fight me!

47
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,058
They all run away.

48
00:15:33,141 --> 00:15:36,562
Here, laddie, stay by me.

49
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:44,736
Mother of God.

50
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,243
Fight me!

51
00:16:04,673 --> 00:16:06,884
No!

52
00:16:06,967 --> 00:16:09,261
Come on, quick!

53
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:11,180
There can be only one!

54
00:16:14,266 --> 00:16:16,268
Another time, Macleod!

55
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:52,888
Get out of the car!

56
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:56,391
Put your hands
on the hood!

57
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,393
Move!

58
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:00,687
Okay!

59
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:04,107
Watch it, freak!
Just cool it!

60
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,692
Watch him!
Watch him!

61
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:09,196
Move! Come on!
Come on! Move!

62
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:11,406
Come on!
Get up there!

63
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:13,075
Aah!

64
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,576
Spread 'em!
Spread 'em!

65
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,912
- Come on!

66
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,790
Let's see
some I.D., pal.

67
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,001
Well, Mr. Nash.

68
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:27,297
Where were you going
in such a hurry?

69
00:17:27,381 --> 00:17:31,301
Give me it!
Give me it!

70
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:32,386
Ooh!

71
00:17:37,307 --> 00:17:40,227
Don't move, pal.

72
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,396
Don't even breathe!

73
00:18:22,728 --> 00:18:26,815
In nomine patri et filii
et spiritu sancti.

74
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,233
Amen.

75
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:32,112
It is over.

76
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,614
No!

77
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:36,241
Other men are
dying this day.

78
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,452
I must attend them.

79
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,038
Quiet!

80
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,628
He's a highlander, by God!

81
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,130
The last sound he hears...

82
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:53,842
shouldn't be that
of a wailing woman!

83
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:20,369
Hey, let me through.

84
00:19:20,452 --> 00:19:24,248
Damn it, Frank.
Forensics is supposed to be notified...

85
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,542
the same time as homicide.

86
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:28,043
Holy shit.

87
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:29,962
Yeah, this one came unassembled.

88
00:19:30,045 --> 00:19:31,547
Did you make an arrest?

89
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,758
No. We're questioning
some guy named Nash.

90
00:19:34,842 --> 00:19:37,177
Antique dealer on Hudson Street.

91
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:39,847
- Hello, Brenda.
- Hey, Walt.

92
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:42,182
You look pretty, Brenda.

93
00:19:42,266 --> 00:19:43,684
What do you think's...

94
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,561
the cause of death,
Lieutenant, huh?

95
00:19:45,561 --> 00:19:48,981
You're a barrel
of laughs, Garfield.

96
00:19:49,064 --> 00:19:50,983
Get your hands off!

97
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,069
Try explaining this to my wife!

98
00:19:54,069 --> 00:19:57,364
Get me a cherry-cheese danish too.

99
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,575
What time did he buy it?

100
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:01,159
About 10:00, 10:30.

101
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:03,871
Whatever cut him
was razor sharp.

102
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:07,875
Get out of here
with these cameras!

103
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,877
Frank! Frank!

104
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,962
Oh, my God.

105
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:15,883
A guy was killed
like this in Jersey.

106
00:20:15,966 --> 00:20:18,802
What the hell.
That's Jersey.

107
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:20,387
I want out!

108
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,681
Hey, Frank. Come here.

109
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:26,101
Aw, shit!

110
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:31,273
Ooh, baby.
Look at you.

111
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,401
Garfield, cover that head.

112
00:20:36,278 --> 00:20:38,780
Oh...

113
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,783
What the hell
have you got?

114
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:44,077
A Toledo-Salamanca.

115
00:20:44,203 --> 00:20:45,495
A what?

116
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,290
A sword, Frank.
A very rare sword.

117
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,292
Is it worth much?

118
00:20:50,417 --> 00:20:52,794
Only about a million bucks.

119
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,798
Any antique dealer
on Hudson Street...

120
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:58,300
could tell you that.

121
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:03,805
You can't keep me here!

122
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:06,016
I know my rights!

123
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:38,423
Ever see this guy before, Nash?

124
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:40,717
His name's Vazilek,
Polish national.

125
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:44,137
Had his head chopped off
in New Jersey two nights ago.

126
00:21:44,221 --> 00:21:46,723
You ever get over
to New Jersey, Nash?

127
00:21:46,807 --> 00:21:48,809
Not if I can help it.

128
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,811
You talk funny.
Where you from?

129
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:52,813
Lots of different places.

130
00:21:52,938 --> 00:21:56,316
- You're an antique dealer, right?
- Mm-hmm.

131
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:59,027
Okay. What's that?

132
00:22:03,115 --> 00:22:04,741
A sword?

133
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:06,827
Wise up, smart ass.

134
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:12,541
It's a Toledo-Salamanca broadsword
worth about a million bucks.

135
00:22:12,624 --> 00:22:13,917
So?

136
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,919
So you want to hear a theory?

137
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:19,756
You went down that garage
to buy this sword from that guy...

138
00:22:19,756 --> 00:22:22,259
- What's his name?
- I don't know. You tell me.

139
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,261
Okay, his name's
lman Fasil.

140
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:27,347
You fought about the price
and cut off his head.

141
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,725
Want to hear another theory?

142
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:32,352
This Fasil was so upset...

143
00:22:32,352 --> 00:22:34,938
about the lousy
wrestling tonight...

144
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:41,153
in a fit of depression,
he cut off his own head.

145
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:43,030
That's not funny, Walt.

146
00:22:43,155 --> 00:22:45,157
Are you a faggot, Nash?

147
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:47,951
Why? You cruising
for a piece of ass?

148
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,747
I'll tell you
what happened, Russell.

149
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,750
You went down to the garage
for a blow job.

150
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:57,044
You just didn't
want to pay for it.

151
00:22:57,169 --> 00:22:59,963
Huh. You are sick.

152
00:23:00,964 --> 00:23:02,257
Hey! Hey!

153
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,843
Hey, what are you doing?

154
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,053
Stop!

155
00:23:06,178 --> 00:23:08,680
- What, are you crazy?
- Break it up, goddamn it!

156
00:23:08,764 --> 00:23:12,184
That's enough!
Now, cut it out!

157
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:14,853
Goddamn it,
I said cut it out!

158
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,982
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

159
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,068
Then we're through.

160
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,362
Nash, we're just
getting started.

161
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,076
...in water from the sprinkler.

162
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,954
It also left a man's
decapitated body...

163
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:35,457
next to his own severed head.

164
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,961
A head which at this time
has no name.

165
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:41,171
I know his name.

166
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:46,176
* Here I am *

167
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:50,180
* I'm the master
of your destiny *

168
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:52,975
Ahh!

169
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:57,396
* I am the one
The only one *

170
00:23:57,479 --> 00:24:00,399
* I am the god
of kingdom come *

171
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:02,693
* Give me the prize *

172
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,195
* Just give me the prize *

173
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:17,583
Okay, Mr. Victor Kruger.

174
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:19,084
Room 315.

175
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:23,005
And I'll hit you
for 20 in advance.

176
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,386
Uh, hey, uh.

177
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,889
If there's anything
you need...

178
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:35,684
Broads, uh, blow.
Just dial 0, huh?

179
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,020
That's right, Mr. Kruger.

180
00:24:38,103 --> 00:24:40,898
Lucky Strike means
fine tobacco.

181
00:24:41,023 --> 00:24:43,317
Don't talk to the guests.

182
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:45,027
I didn't do nothing.

183
00:25:36,912 --> 00:25:38,914
At last...

184
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,832
the gathering.

185
00:25:45,045 --> 00:25:46,338
Hi.

186
00:25:46,421 --> 00:25:47,840
I'm Candy.

187
00:25:51,552 --> 00:25:53,554
Of course you are.

188
00:26:04,064 --> 00:26:05,566
Come on in.

189
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:09,027
Hiya. Got a present
from the coroner.

190
00:26:09,027 --> 00:26:14,032
Pieces of metal found
on the dead guy under the Garden.

191
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:16,869
In the wound
and on the clothes.

192
00:26:16,952 --> 00:26:18,871
Real smooth shave.

193
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:38,056
That can't be right.

194
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,063
Son of a bitch.

195
00:27:43,705 --> 00:27:45,290
Who's there?

196
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:05,018
Hey, Brenda. Usual?

197
00:28:05,018 --> 00:28:06,520
Lots of it.

198
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,021
Oh.

199
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:12,484
* Is better than
a lifetime alone *

200
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,111
Say when.

201
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:17,990
* One sentimental moment
in your arms *

202
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:19,116
When.

203
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,202
* Is like a shooting star... *

204
00:28:22,327 --> 00:28:24,913
Excuse me a minute, Brenda.

205
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,416
Double Glenmoran on the rocks.

206
00:28:27,499 --> 00:28:28,792
Glenmoran. Right.

207
00:28:28,917 --> 00:28:31,420
Go to the Garden often?

208
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,006
What did you say?

209
00:28:34,131 --> 00:28:35,716
Hmm?

210
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:40,220
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

211
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:45,017
* I'm falling apart all around you *

212
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,102
What did you say?

213
00:28:48,604 --> 00:28:51,607
Madison...Square...Garden.

214
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:55,527
Do you go there often?

215
00:28:55,611 --> 00:28:56,612
Why?

216
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,531
Basketball?

217
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:01,617
The circus? Wrestling?

218
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:05,037
Why are you asking me?

219
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,039
Have you been following me?

220
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:11,251
I'd like to walk
you home, Brenda.

221
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:14,755
Uh...

222
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:20,427
I can take care of myself.

223
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:27,142
* It's always a rainy day without you *

224
00:29:27,226 --> 00:29:32,356
* I'm a prisoner of love
inside you *

225
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,442
* I'm falling apart *

226
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:39,446
* All around you *

227
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:33,083
Huh!

228
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,168
Aah!

229
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:35,586
Be quiet!

230
00:30:35,669 --> 00:30:36,753
Unnhhrr!

231
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,675
Aah!

232
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,062
Here. Take this.

233
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:18,587
Ha ha ha!

234
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:20,714
Aah!

235
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:23,008
Oh!

236
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,513
Nice to see you
again, Macleod.

237
00:31:27,596 --> 00:31:29,389
Nice to see you...

238
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,517
Ooh!

239
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,519
- Ooh!
- Stop!

240
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:35,395
There can be only one!

241
00:31:39,191 --> 00:31:40,901
No!

242
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:42,110
Unh!

243
00:31:42,194 --> 00:31:43,403
Unnhhrr!

244
00:31:44,488 --> 00:31:45,906
You, on the ground.

245
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:47,616
This is the police.

246
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:49,993
Put down your weapons.

247
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:51,912
Hands on your head.

248
00:31:51,995 --> 00:31:54,915
Another time, Highlander!
I will find you!

249
00:31:54,998 --> 00:31:58,001
Hold it right there!

250
00:31:58,126 --> 00:31:59,920
Come back here!

251
00:32:03,507 --> 00:32:04,424
Stop!

252
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:05,926
Wait!

253
00:32:06,009 --> 00:32:07,427
Who was that?

254
00:32:07,511 --> 00:32:08,929
He called you Highlander.

255
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:10,931
"There can be only one"?

256
00:32:11,014 --> 00:32:12,432
Only one what?

257
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:15,435
- I want to know!
- Shut up!

258
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,438
Don't you ever
follow me again.

259
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,941
You only have one life.

260
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:24,111
If you value it...
go home.

261
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:32,536
Ha ha!

262
00:32:35,914 --> 00:32:37,916
You saw the wound.

263
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:39,918
He should have died.

264
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:42,921
I say he's got
the devil in him.

265
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:06,445
Drinking with us, are you?

266
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:08,155
What's the matter, Dugal?

267
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:09,740
You, talking
and breathing...

268
00:33:09,865 --> 00:33:13,035
and last night,
all but a corpse.

269
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,745
How did you manage that?

270
00:33:14,828 --> 00:33:17,039
You'd rather I was dead?

271
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,041
It's not natural.

272
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:24,046
He's in league with Lucifer.

273
00:33:24,171 --> 00:33:27,257
Don't say that, Kate.

274
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:29,134
I'll say it.

275
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:31,345
You've the devil in you.

276
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:34,556
We've been kinsmen 20 years.

277
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:37,059
Connor Macleod was my kinsman.

278
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:40,479
I don't know who you are.

279
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:47,152
Angus.

280
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:49,154
You better go, Connor.

281
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,159
I'm not going anywhere.

282
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:56,370
He's the devil!
Kill him!

283
00:33:56,453 --> 00:33:57,579
Lucifer!

284
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,588
Burn the devil out of him!

285
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:18,267
All right.
Get him down.

286
00:34:18,392 --> 00:34:19,476
Burn him!

287
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,563
Leave him be!

288
00:34:22,563 --> 00:34:23,897
Dugal...

289
00:34:23,981 --> 00:34:25,774
Oh!

290
00:34:25,899 --> 00:34:28,986
He's your cousin, man!

291
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:39,288
No, Angus!

292
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,372
Quiet!

293
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:41,999
Quiet!

294
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,169
There'll be no burning
here today!

295
00:34:45,294 --> 00:34:46,795
We'll banish him!

296
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,590
No! Burn him!

297
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:51,091
Stop it, Kate!

298
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,593
Burn him!

299
00:34:53,886 --> 00:34:56,180
Angus, burn him!

300
00:34:56,305 --> 00:34:57,389
Can you walk?

301
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,516
I'll bloody well
walk out of here.

302
00:34:59,516 --> 00:35:02,311
Then go!
While there's still time.

303
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:06,398
I'll not forget you, Angus.

304
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,446
That's a good dog.

305
00:37:25,078 --> 00:37:28,665
Pie and ale.
Do you want it?

306
00:37:28,749 --> 00:37:31,168
Aye. Right now.

307
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,671
You filthy sod!
You're all muck and muscle.

308
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:38,550
Aye, blossom.
The way you like it.

309
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:39,968
Ha ha ha!

310
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,262
Ha ha!

311
00:37:42,387 --> 00:37:43,263
Ahh!

312
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:44,556
Waah!

313
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:02,991
You can do that to me
forever, my lord.

314
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,788
Will you, Connor?

315
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,499
Aye, blossom. I will.

316
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:19,007
Whoa!

317
00:38:24,179 --> 00:38:25,681
Greetings.

318
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:29,309
I am Juan Sanchez
Villa-Lobos Ramirez...

319
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:33,605
chief metallurgist
to King Charles V of Spain...

320
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:35,983
and I'm at your service.

321
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:37,609
Who?

322
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,699
What do you want?

323
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,409
You.

324
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:49,913
You're Connor Macleod.

325
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:51,623
Maybe I am and...

326
00:38:51,707 --> 00:38:54,918
You're Connor Macleod,
wounded in battle...

327
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:58,922
and driven from your village
five years ago.

328
00:38:59,006 --> 00:39:00,716
- Connor!
- Ohh!

329
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:04,219
Heather, go in the house.

330
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:05,721
I'll stay right here.

331
00:39:05,804 --> 00:39:07,806
Do as I say, woman!

332
00:39:16,815 --> 00:39:19,818
Aaah!

333
00:39:19,818 --> 00:39:20,736
Aah!

334
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:22,237
Aaah!

335
00:39:22,321 --> 00:39:27,201
The sensation you're feeling
is the quickening.

336
00:39:28,911 --> 00:39:30,412
Who are you?

337
00:39:30,537 --> 00:39:33,040
We are the same, Macleod!

338
00:39:33,123 --> 00:39:36,627
We are brothers!

339
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:46,011
I knew you guys
were bottle-fed.

340
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:51,517
Well, there's not a lot
I can do about it, pal.

341
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:53,936
See what I'm up against?

342
00:39:53,936 --> 00:39:57,356
His Vietnamese neighbor
ate his dog.

343
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,733
Uh...
that's confidential.

344
00:39:59,816 --> 00:40:01,735
How are things
in forensics?

345
00:40:01,735 --> 00:40:04,154
Dull. How about lunch?

346
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:07,157
Lunch? It's a good idea.
Who pays?

347
00:40:07,241 --> 00:40:08,325
Me.

348
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,826
You're on.

349
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,828
By the way, Frank...

350
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:14,331
the hairs in the Moretti case...

351
00:40:14,331 --> 00:40:15,832
matched up.

352
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,960
Oh, I forgot my purse.

353
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,963
I'll meet you outside.

354
00:40:20,963 --> 00:40:24,049
Garfield, Brenda and I
are going to lunch.

355
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:10,387
Sometimes, Macleod...

356
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:13,473
the sharpest blade is not enough.

357
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:25,068
* B-A-L-A-N-C-E
Balance *

358
00:41:25,194 --> 00:41:27,196
I don't like boats!
I don't like water!

359
00:41:27,279 --> 00:41:30,199
I'm a man, not a fish.

360
00:41:30,282 --> 00:41:32,284
Oh, you complain endlessly.

361
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:36,163
You look like a woman,
you stupid haggis.

362
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,664
Haggis? What is haggis?

363
00:41:37,789 --> 00:41:40,000
Sheep's stomach stuffed
with meat and barley.

364
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:42,669
And what do you
do with it?

365
00:41:42,794 --> 00:41:44,505
You eat it.

366
00:41:44,505 --> 00:41:46,798
How revolting.

367
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:47,883
Ah-choo!

368
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:50,594
Be still.
You'll tip us over!

369
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:51,678
So?

370
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:54,473
I cannot swim,
you Spanish peacock.

371
00:41:54,473 --> 00:41:55,974
I'm not Spanish.
I'm Egyptian.

372
00:41:55,974 --> 00:41:58,977
You said you were
from Spain! Liar!

373
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,481
You have the manners
of a goat...

374
00:42:02,606 --> 00:42:05,984
and you smell like dung.

375
00:42:06,109 --> 00:42:09,404
And you have no knowledge
whatsoever of your potential.

376
00:42:09,404 --> 00:42:11,281
Now, get out!

377
00:42:11,281 --> 00:42:12,491
No!

378
00:42:13,617 --> 00:42:14,993
Help!

379
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:17,621
Help! Help!

380
00:42:19,623 --> 00:42:21,583
Help!

381
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,502
Help me, I'm drowning!

382
00:42:23,585 --> 00:42:26,505
You can't drown, you fool.
You're immortal!

383
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:32,010
I'm drowning!
Come help!

384
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:38,308
* We ask you...
Heavenly Father *

385
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,229
I'm alive.

386
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,819
I can breathe.

387
00:42:58,036 --> 00:42:59,413
Ha ha ha!

388
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:01,832
Ha ha ha ha!

389
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,424
I'll slice you in half.

390
00:43:34,448 --> 00:43:35,449
Hah!

391
00:43:36,658 --> 00:43:38,327
Crude and slow, clansman.

392
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:42,331
Your attack was no better
than that of a clumsy child.

393
00:43:42,456 --> 00:43:44,541
Hah!

394
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:54,635
This cannot be.
It's the devil's work.

395
00:43:57,429 --> 00:44:01,850
You cannot die, Macleod.
Accept it.

396
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,352
Ha ha ha!

397
00:44:03,435 --> 00:44:05,145
Ha ha ha!

398
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:08,273
I hate you.

399
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:09,274
Good.

400
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:11,443
That is a perfect
way to start.

401
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:14,363
Tell me...

402
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:16,573
how did it happen,
for God's sake?

403
00:44:19,576 --> 00:44:23,080
Why does the sun
come up, hmm?

404
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:27,167
Or are the stars just pinholes
in the curtain of night?

405
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:29,169
Who knows?

406
00:44:29,169 --> 00:44:30,963
What I do know is...

407
00:44:31,046 --> 00:44:32,881
because you were
born different...

408
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:37,386
men will fear you,
try to drive you away...

409
00:44:37,469 --> 00:44:39,763
Iike the people
of your village.

410
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:54,570
You must learn to conceal
your special gift...

411
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,488
and harness your power...

412
00:44:56,572 --> 00:44:59,658
until the time
of the gathering.

413
00:45:02,578 --> 00:45:04,079
What gathering?

414
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:06,999
When only a few of us
are left...

415
00:45:07,082 --> 00:45:08,792
we will feel
an irresistible pull...

416
00:45:08,876 --> 00:45:12,171
towards a faraway land...

417
00:45:12,296 --> 00:45:14,298
to fight for the prize.

418
00:45:17,676 --> 00:45:19,094
Come on!

419
00:45:20,095 --> 00:45:21,680
Faster!

420
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,106
Unh!

421
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:33,108
Never lose your temper.

422
00:45:33,192 --> 00:45:36,612
If your head comes away
from your neck...

423
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:38,113
it's over.

424
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,996
Ha ha ha!

425
00:46:02,012 --> 00:46:03,013
Unnh!

426
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:06,016
Never overextend
your thrust.

427
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,393
You're vulnerable and...

428
00:46:08,519 --> 00:46:10,395
off balance.

429
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:12,606
Connor! Ha ha ha!

430
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:16,026
Heather, please.

431
00:46:28,205 --> 00:46:33,836
If it came down to us two,
would you take my head?

432
00:46:33,919 --> 00:46:35,337
Ha!

433
00:46:37,631 --> 00:46:40,509
We must fight
until only one remains.

434
00:46:40,509 --> 00:46:43,929
You are safe only on holy ground.

435
00:46:44,012 --> 00:46:47,641
None of us will violate that law.

436
00:46:47,724 --> 00:46:49,226
It's tradition.

437
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,116
Now for the last.

438
00:47:04,241 --> 00:47:06,827
Trust me.

439
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:13,125
Let yourself
feel the stag.

440
00:47:16,128 --> 00:47:18,046
His heart...

441
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,631
beating.

442
00:47:26,763 --> 00:47:29,850
His blood...coursing.

443
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:31,852
Feel?

444
00:47:33,061 --> 00:47:34,438
Come on!

445
00:47:34,563 --> 00:47:37,566
I feel him.

446
00:47:37,649 --> 00:47:40,152
Macleod, come on!

447
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:41,653
I feel him!

448
00:47:41,737 --> 00:47:43,572
Come on!

449
00:47:43,572 --> 00:47:45,949
Ha ha ha!

450
00:47:46,074 --> 00:47:48,869
I feel him!

451
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,871
Ha ha ha!

452
00:47:50,871 --> 00:47:53,165
Ha ha ha!

453
00:47:53,165 --> 00:47:55,459
Come on, haggis!

454
00:47:58,879 --> 00:48:00,964
Macleod.

455
00:48:01,048 --> 00:48:03,383
This is the quickening.

456
00:48:03,467 --> 00:48:05,385
Yeah!

457
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:06,678
Yaah!

458
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:40,963
Now, pendejo...

459
00:48:40,963 --> 00:48:44,967
shall we see what sort of
swordsman you've become?

460
00:48:45,092 --> 00:48:46,885
En garde!

461
00:48:54,977 --> 00:48:56,603
Very good.

462
00:49:14,997 --> 00:49:18,083
Give me your hand, brother.

463
00:49:34,516 --> 00:49:36,393
That one there.

464
00:49:36,518 --> 00:49:38,604
How much is it?

465
00:49:54,703 --> 00:49:56,622
Put him in.

466
00:49:56,622 --> 00:50:00,000
But what I want is a family.

467
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,419
You cannot have a family.

468
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:04,922
We cannot have children.

469
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,341
That won't please Heather.

470
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:10,427
I'll tell you that
for nothing.

471
00:50:10,427 --> 00:50:13,138
He's full of life.

472
00:50:14,515 --> 00:50:16,141
Connor!

473
00:50:19,019 --> 00:50:20,646
Here's dinner!

474
00:50:22,523 --> 00:50:24,024
I'll be off now.

475
00:50:24,024 --> 00:50:26,652
I fancy buying
a new dress.

476
00:50:30,030 --> 00:50:34,034
Oh, you little devils!
Go on!

477
00:50:35,327 --> 00:50:37,037
She's beautiful.

478
00:50:38,455 --> 00:50:41,959
You must leave her,
brother.

479
00:50:52,553 --> 00:50:54,930
Macleod.

480
00:50:55,055 --> 00:50:57,933
I was born 2,437 years ago.

481
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:01,436
In that time,
I've had three wives.

482
00:51:01,562 --> 00:51:04,940
The last was Shakiko,
a Japanese princess.

483
00:51:05,065 --> 00:51:08,652
Her father, Masamune, a genius...

484
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:10,946
made this for me...

485
00:51:11,071 --> 00:51:13,866
in 593 B.C.

486
00:51:15,075 --> 00:51:19,037
It is the only one
of its kind...

487
00:51:19,162 --> 00:51:21,039
Iike his daughter.

488
00:51:21,164 --> 00:51:24,376
When Shakiko died,
I was shattered.

489
00:51:24,459 --> 00:51:27,379
I would save you
that pain.

490
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:30,382
Please.
Let Heather go.

491
00:51:48,859 --> 00:51:52,863
When we first met,
you felt ill, remember?

492
00:51:52,863 --> 00:51:55,157
That wasn't the first time...

493
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:58,160
you felt
that sensation, was it?

494
00:51:58,285 --> 00:51:59,661
No.

495
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:02,164
When the Macleods
fought the Frazers...

496
00:52:02,289 --> 00:52:04,791
and a black knight...

497
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:07,085
I felt it then.

498
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:09,588
Only it was more painful.

499
00:52:09,671 --> 00:52:12,090
That black knight
was the Kurgan.

500
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:15,093
It's because of him
that I sought you out.

501
00:52:16,595 --> 00:52:18,472
Who is the Kurgan?

502
00:52:18,597 --> 00:52:20,474
Where does
he come from?

503
00:52:20,474 --> 00:52:22,684
The Kurgans were
an ancient people...

504
00:52:22,684 --> 00:52:24,394
from the steppes
of Russia.

505
00:52:24,394 --> 00:52:26,188
For amusement,
they tossed children...

506
00:52:26,188 --> 00:52:30,108
into pits with hungry dogs
to fight for meat.

507
00:52:30,192 --> 00:52:31,610
The Kurgan.

508
00:52:31,693 --> 00:52:34,780
He is the strongest
of the immortals.

509
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:37,199
He is the perfect warrior.

510
00:52:37,282 --> 00:52:39,785
If he wins the prize...

511
00:52:39,910 --> 00:52:43,789
mortal man would suffer
an eternity of darkness.

512
00:52:43,914 --> 00:52:46,291
How do you fight
such a savage?

513
00:52:46,416 --> 00:52:51,088
Hmm. With heart,
faith, and steel.

514
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:54,800
In the end,
there can be only one.

515
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:02,099
very dangerous for you.

516
00:53:02,224 --> 00:53:04,726
Well, I was very much in love...

517
00:53:04,726 --> 00:53:05,894
with her, my dear.

518
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:09,022
She was the only thing
on my mind.

519
00:53:09,022 --> 00:53:11,400
So, holding the rose
in my teeth...

520
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,903
I climbed up on the rooftop,
lowered a rope...

521
00:53:15,028 --> 00:53:17,322
and swung in
through the open window.

522
00:53:20,033 --> 00:53:23,203
Unfortunately, the lady
was no longer there.

523
00:53:23,203 --> 00:53:24,621
What did you do?

524
00:53:24,705 --> 00:53:26,123
I introduced myself...

525
00:53:26,206 --> 00:53:28,625
to the lady that was there.

526
00:53:28,709 --> 00:53:30,210
She was most helpful.

527
00:53:32,629 --> 00:53:35,507
Would you like
some more wine?

528
00:53:35,632 --> 00:53:37,718
Yes, please.

529
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:49,938
Heather.

530
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,440
Get out!

531
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,025
What's wrong?

532
00:53:58,447 --> 00:54:00,824
Get out!

533
00:54:00,824 --> 00:54:02,534
Aaah!

534
00:54:02,618 --> 00:54:04,036
Kurgan!

535
00:54:05,537 --> 00:54:07,456
Ramirez!

536
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:13,045
Raah!

537
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:20,344
The Highlander,
where is he?

538
00:54:20,427 --> 00:54:21,637
You're too late.

539
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:23,764
I've prepared him
for you.

540
00:54:23,764 --> 00:54:25,349
You waste your time!

541
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,230
Aah!

542
00:54:38,070 --> 00:54:40,155
Aah!

543
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:54,837
It hurts?

544
00:54:59,550 --> 00:55:00,676
Raaah!

545
00:55:00,676 --> 00:55:01,969
Aaah!

546
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:10,769
Now you die!
Heh heh heh!

547
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:17,568
I am the strongest!

548
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:20,571
My cut has improved
your voice.

549
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,258
Yes!

550
00:57:34,955 --> 00:57:38,250
Ahh. Hurts?

551
00:57:41,962 --> 00:57:44,256
Who is the woman?

552
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,467
Oh! She's mine!

553
00:57:49,052 --> 00:57:51,680
Not for much longer.

554
00:58:01,273 --> 00:58:03,984
Tonight you sleep
in hell!

555
00:58:04,067 --> 00:58:06,778
There can be only one!

556
00:58:53,450 --> 00:58:56,453
Hello, pretty.

557
00:59:06,964 --> 00:59:08,966
I'd like to speak
to Russell Nash.

558
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:12,052
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Nash isn't here.

559
00:59:12,052 --> 00:59:14,763
May I call him at home?

560
00:59:14,888 --> 00:59:16,682
That won't be possible.

561
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:18,767
Good morning.

562
00:59:18,851 --> 00:59:21,770
This is Brenda Wyatt,
Mr. Nash.

563
00:59:23,063 --> 00:59:24,857
We've already met, Rachel.

564
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:27,359
What can I do for you?

565
00:59:27,484 --> 00:59:28,861
I'd like some advice.

566
00:59:28,986 --> 00:59:31,780
Are you someone
who takes advice?

567
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:33,365
That depends.

568
00:59:33,365 --> 00:59:34,950
Advice about what?

569
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,452
What can you tell me
about a seven-foot lunatic...

570
00:59:37,578 --> 00:59:39,162
hacking away with a broadsword...

571
00:59:39,288 --> 00:59:41,748
at one in the morning,
New York City, 1985?

572
00:59:44,376 --> 00:59:46,170
Not much.

573
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:49,089
A Japanese sword
dated 600 B.C...

574
00:59:49,089 --> 00:59:51,550
the metal folded 200 times?

575
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:54,386
I don't deal
in exotic weapons.

576
00:59:54,469 --> 00:59:58,182
May I show you something
in 18th-century silver?

577
00:59:58,182 --> 01:00:02,186
That's not why I came.
You know it.

578
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:03,854
Do you cook?

579
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:05,355
Why?

580
01:00:05,355 --> 01:00:08,483
I thought
we might have dinner.

581
01:00:08,567 --> 01:00:10,277
Did you?

582
01:00:10,360 --> 01:00:11,486
Yes.

583
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:16,366
So I'm standing there,
and there's Brenda.

584
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:18,660
Our little Brenda.

585
01:00:18,785 --> 01:00:21,455
You're sure it was Brenda?

586
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:25,375
She was in Nash's shop
talking to him.

587
01:00:33,467 --> 01:00:35,385
What are you
looking at, Rachel?

588
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:38,055
The eyes in the back of your head.

589
01:00:40,474 --> 01:00:42,976
People are asking
about you.

590
01:00:42,976 --> 01:00:45,187
What am I supposed to say?

591
01:00:45,270 --> 01:00:46,980
Hmm?

592
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,774
Tell them I'm immortal.

593
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:24,768
Shh.

594
01:01:25,853 --> 01:01:27,688
Quiet.

595
01:01:32,985 --> 01:01:34,862
Don't be frightened.

596
01:01:34,987 --> 01:01:37,489
- What's your name?
- Rachel.

597
01:01:37,573 --> 01:01:41,159
- What happened?
- Everybody's dead.

598
01:01:44,788 --> 01:01:46,748
I'm like you.
I'm alone.

599
01:01:46,874 --> 01:01:48,667
Come with me, Rachel.

600
01:02:03,056 --> 01:02:06,059
You're alive.
Why didn't you die?

601
01:02:06,185 --> 01:02:08,353
Hey. It's a kind of magic.

602
01:02:14,776 --> 01:02:16,778
- Move!
- Nein!

603
01:02:18,572 --> 01:02:20,949
Heh heh heh.
Whatever you say, Jack.

604
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:22,659
You're the master race.

605
01:02:27,372 --> 01:02:28,665
Let's go.

606
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:33,462
That was a long time ago.

607
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:37,257
Would you listen to me
for one moment, please?

608
01:02:37,257 --> 01:02:39,676
You can't hide
your feelings from me.

609
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,054
I've known you too long.

610
01:02:42,054 --> 01:02:43,680
What feelings?

611
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,557
How about loneliness?

612
01:02:45,682 --> 01:02:48,268
I'm not lonely.

613
01:02:48,352 --> 01:02:51,188
I've got everything
I need right here.

614
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:52,856
Oh, no, you don't.

615
01:02:52,981 --> 01:02:58,153
You refuse to let
anyone love you.

616
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:00,489
Love is for poets.

617
01:03:04,076 --> 01:03:07,663
You're such
a romantic, Rachel.

618
01:03:07,788 --> 01:03:10,749
You always were.

619
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,356
Just a minute.

620
01:03:53,667 --> 01:03:55,252
Good evening.

621
01:03:59,464 --> 01:04:01,884
You want to dine
in the hall...

622
01:04:01,967 --> 01:04:03,760
or shall we step inside?

623
01:04:03,886 --> 01:04:05,554
Ohh.

624
01:04:05,679 --> 01:04:06,889
Come in.

625
01:04:08,849 --> 01:04:10,350
May I take your coat?

626
01:04:10,350 --> 01:04:11,476
What? No, thanks.

627
01:04:11,560 --> 01:04:13,478
I'll hold on to it.

628
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:15,189
Oh, fine.

629
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,985
Where are you going?

630
01:04:20,068 --> 01:04:22,279
I forgot my earrings.

631
01:04:22,362 --> 01:04:24,281
Make yourself a drink.

632
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:27,451
There are glasses in the bar.

633
01:04:38,462 --> 01:04:40,672
You know what you're doing?

634
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:03,862
I like your place, Brenda.

635
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:08,283
I've been here three months.
Still fixing it up.

636
01:05:12,162 --> 01:05:14,248
Interesting view.

637
01:05:14,373 --> 01:05:16,375
What did you say?

638
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:24,049
I said, "Interesting view"!

639
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:25,884
Isn't it great?

640
01:05:31,682 --> 01:05:33,684
You never told me...

641
01:05:33,684 --> 01:05:36,687
what you do
for a living.

642
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:41,483
I work for
the Metropolitan Museum...

643
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:44,278
in acquisitions.

644
01:05:44,361 --> 01:05:47,489
Huh. That explains
your interest...

645
01:05:47,573 --> 01:05:49,867
in ancient weapons.

646
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,287
Right.

647
01:05:54,872 --> 01:05:57,875
Especially the samurai.

648
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:59,459
Very nice.

649
01:05:59,585 --> 01:06:01,879
Shall we have a toast?

650
01:06:01,962 --> 01:06:03,463
Yes.

651
01:06:08,468 --> 01:06:10,470
Brandy.

652
01:06:10,554 --> 01:06:13,182
Bottled in 1783.

653
01:06:13,265 --> 01:06:15,475
Wow. That's old.

654
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:21,565
1783 was a very good year.

655
01:06:22,983 --> 01:06:25,485
Mozart wrote
his great mass.

656
01:06:25,485 --> 01:06:28,071
The Montgolfier Brothers went up...

657
01:06:28,155 --> 01:06:31,074
in their first balloon.

658
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:34,453
Hah.

659
01:06:34,578 --> 01:06:36,455
And England recognized...

660
01:06:36,580 --> 01:06:39,958
the independence
of the United States.

661
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:42,461
Is that right?

662
01:06:42,586 --> 01:06:43,879
Yes.

663
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:52,971
What's that?

664
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:54,973
It's for you.

665
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,683
Can I open it?

666
01:06:56,683 --> 01:06:58,352
If you like.

667
01:07:12,783 --> 01:07:13,659
You bastard.

668
01:07:13,784 --> 01:07:15,661
Where did you find this?

669
01:07:15,786 --> 01:07:17,871
I have an extensive library.

670
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:20,749
Odd thing.

671
01:07:20,749 --> 01:07:23,168
Your bio doesn't
mention the Met.

672
01:07:23,252 --> 01:07:25,671
It says you work
for the police...

673
01:07:25,754 --> 01:07:27,548
in forensics.

674
01:07:27,548 --> 01:07:29,675
Are you and Moran
setting me up?

675
01:07:29,758 --> 01:07:31,760
I don't work for Moran.

676
01:07:31,885 --> 01:07:34,179
Then why is that bald policeman...

677
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:36,682
sitting outside
watching your apartment?

678
01:07:38,475 --> 01:07:39,768
You remember him.

679
01:07:39,852 --> 01:07:41,186
Moran's had him tailing me.

680
01:07:41,186 --> 01:07:43,355
What are you going to do?

681
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:46,066
Question is,
what are you going to do?

682
01:07:46,149 --> 01:07:48,861
Turn off the tape or
shoot me with the .45?

683
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:54,366
I'm not looking
for a killer.

684
01:07:54,449 --> 01:07:55,868
I'm looking for a sword.

685
01:07:55,951 --> 01:07:57,953
The one used on Fasil.

686
01:07:57,953 --> 01:08:00,789
- I only want to see the samurai.
- Why?

687
01:08:00,873 --> 01:08:02,875
Because it's not
supposed to exist.

688
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:05,085
I dated the blade
at 600 B.C.

689
01:08:05,169 --> 01:08:07,462
The metal had been
folded 200 times.

690
01:08:07,588 --> 01:08:10,966
The Japanese didn't make swords
like that till the Middle Ages.

691
01:08:11,049 --> 01:08:13,385
So where the hell
did it come from?

692
01:08:13,385 --> 01:08:15,387
If I could verify
its existence...

693
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,848
it would be like
discovering a 747...

694
01:08:17,848 --> 01:08:20,851
a thousand years
before the Wright Brothers ever flew.

695
01:08:20,976 --> 01:08:23,353
This is crazy.

696
01:08:23,478 --> 01:08:26,064
Wait a minute, Nash.
I want some answers.

697
01:08:27,983 --> 01:08:29,985
You want?

698
01:08:29,985 --> 01:08:32,362
Don't you ever
think about anything...

699
01:08:32,487 --> 01:08:34,072
except what you want?

700
01:08:48,462 --> 01:08:50,589
You must leave her, brother.

701
01:10:11,253 --> 01:10:12,671
Heather!

702
01:10:29,688 --> 01:10:30,689
Heather!

703
01:10:32,357 --> 01:10:35,152
Connor, I'm here!

704
01:10:56,548 --> 01:10:59,051
My beautiful man.

705
01:10:59,051 --> 01:11:01,053
My husband.

706
01:11:01,053 --> 01:11:04,181
I am that, my love.

707
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:11,480
I've never really known...

708
01:11:11,563 --> 01:11:13,148
What?

709
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:17,152
Why you stayed.

710
01:11:18,570 --> 01:11:21,949
Because I love you
as much now...

711
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:24,952
as the first day we met.

712
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,663
And I love you.

713
01:11:32,084 --> 01:11:34,962
I don't want to die.

714
01:11:35,087 --> 01:11:39,466
I want to stay
with you forever.

715
01:11:39,550 --> 01:11:41,468
I want that too.

716
01:11:41,552 --> 01:11:45,180
Will you do something
for me, Connor?

717
01:11:47,558 --> 01:11:48,976
What, lass?

718
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:52,980
In the years to come,
will you light a candle...

719
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:56,149
and remember me
on my birthday?

720
01:11:56,149 --> 01:12:00,863
Aye, love. I will.

721
01:12:00,988 --> 01:12:04,575
I wanted to have
your children.

722
01:12:04,658 --> 01:12:08,871
They would have been
strong and fine.

723
01:12:13,083 --> 01:12:15,586
Don't see me, Connor.

724
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:18,380
Let me die in peace.

725
01:12:20,966 --> 01:12:23,260
Where are we?

726
01:12:29,558 --> 01:12:32,561
We're in the highlands.

727
01:12:34,479 --> 01:12:36,565
Where else?

728
01:12:39,484 --> 01:12:41,987
Running down a mountainside.

729
01:12:55,959 --> 01:12:58,170
The sun is shining.

730
01:12:59,463 --> 01:13:01,048
It's not cold.

731
01:13:02,966 --> 01:13:05,969
You've got your sheepskins on...

732
01:13:08,180 --> 01:13:11,850
and the boots
I made for you.

733
01:13:15,354 --> 01:13:17,856
Good night,
my bonny Heather.

734
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:35,666
Hey! Kastagir.

735
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:40,087
Macleod, it's good
to see you again.

736
01:13:40,087 --> 01:13:43,048
It seems like 100 years.

737
01:13:43,048 --> 01:13:45,676
It's been 100 years.

738
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:55,352
How have you been?

739
01:13:57,187 --> 01:13:59,565
Hey, this...

740
01:13:59,648 --> 01:14:03,485
puts hairs on your chest.

741
01:14:06,071 --> 01:14:07,573
What is it?

742
01:14:07,573 --> 01:14:08,949
Boom-boom.

743
01:14:08,949 --> 01:14:10,576
Big strong man like you...

744
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:13,287
shouldn't be afraid
of a little boom-boom.

745
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:16,456
Maybe you think
I'm trying to poison you.

746
01:14:16,582 --> 01:14:18,250
I think you're crazy, Kastagir.

747
01:14:19,751 --> 01:14:23,755
So...
the gathering is here.

748
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:25,757
Ahh.

749
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:27,968
Time's almost
caught us, friend.

750
01:14:28,051 --> 01:14:30,971
Has it? Do you think
we should go on?

751
01:14:33,265 --> 01:14:35,684
I think we should
have a party.

752
01:14:35,767 --> 01:14:38,854
Oh, no. I remember
our last party.

753
01:14:38,979 --> 01:14:39,980
Really?

754
01:14:40,063 --> 01:14:41,565
When exactly was that?

755
01:14:41,565 --> 01:14:43,483
It was 1783.

756
01:14:43,567 --> 01:14:46,153
1783.

757
01:14:46,278 --> 01:14:47,654
Oh, yes.

758
01:14:47,779 --> 01:14:50,157
Your famous duel
on Boston Common.

759
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:51,658
Ha ha ha!
You were drunk.

760
01:14:51,783 --> 01:14:54,161
What was that guy's name again?

761
01:14:54,286 --> 01:14:55,787
His name was Bassett.

762
01:14:55,787 --> 01:14:57,164
The heavier blade, Mr. Bassett.

763
01:14:57,289 --> 01:14:58,165
I implore you.

764
01:14:58,248 --> 01:15:01,752
I am fighting this duel,
Hotchkiss, not you.

765
01:15:01,877 --> 01:15:04,171
See if the imbecile is ready.

766
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:06,673
Mr. Bassett is waiting, sir.

767
01:15:06,673 --> 01:15:08,550
Tell him I'm ready.

768
01:15:08,675 --> 01:15:11,386
Christ! I've gone blind.

769
01:15:12,387 --> 01:15:14,264
En garde, sir.

770
01:15:16,850 --> 01:15:19,353
Wonderful, sir.

771
01:15:19,478 --> 01:15:21,271
Thank you, Hotchkiss.

772
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:23,065
Bassett?

773
01:15:23,148 --> 01:15:25,359
That you?

774
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:27,569
You missed him, Mr. Bassett.

775
01:15:34,368 --> 01:15:36,453
The sword, the sword.

776
01:15:48,048 --> 01:15:49,883
Stop, sir.

777
01:15:49,883 --> 01:15:52,052
I beseech you.

778
01:15:52,177 --> 01:15:54,972
I apologize for
calling your wife...

779
01:15:55,055 --> 01:15:57,474
- a bloated warthog...

780
01:15:57,558 --> 01:16:00,561
And I bid you good day.

781
01:16:02,479 --> 01:16:03,856
Shoot him, sir.

782
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:04,773
Shoot him.

783
01:16:04,857 --> 01:16:06,984
Now, sir, in the back!
Now, sir!

784
01:16:07,067 --> 01:16:10,070
Hotchkiss. Hotchkiss!
Stop it!

785
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,365
* Hotchkiss *

786
01:16:13,448 --> 01:16:14,449
What?

787
01:16:14,449 --> 01:16:15,367
No, sir.

788
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:17,870
No, no...

789
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:19,955
No! No! No!

790
01:16:24,084 --> 01:16:27,087
That's the mood
of New York now.

791
01:16:27,171 --> 01:16:29,089
Get out of here!

792
01:16:29,173 --> 01:16:30,465
So far...

793
01:16:37,472 --> 01:16:39,850
Earlier today, in response
to growing pressure...

794
01:16:39,975 --> 01:16:42,352
the mayor's office issued
the following statement...

795
01:16:42,477 --> 01:16:43,979
Give us a drink, pal.

796
01:16:44,062 --> 01:16:46,481
Got a joint?

797
01:16:46,565 --> 01:16:47,983
...vigorous investigation...

798
01:16:47,983 --> 01:16:50,986
following up on
some promising leads.

799
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:54,448
Hey, Rockefeller,
how'd you like Candy?

800
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:58,285
She said you were
kind of kinky, huh?

801
01:16:58,368 --> 01:17:01,580
Don't ever speak to me.

802
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,959
I didn't mean nothin'.

803
01:17:06,084 --> 01:17:08,086
Look, I didn't mean...

804
01:17:10,380 --> 01:17:14,676
Don't ever speak
to me again.

805
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,887
Do you understand?

806
01:17:17,888 --> 01:17:18,889
Yeah.

807
01:17:18,972 --> 01:17:21,475
Good.

808
01:17:24,061 --> 01:17:28,565
I hope you get your head
chopped off, asshole.

809
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:32,486
And you!

810
01:17:32,486 --> 01:17:33,779
Shut it!

811
01:17:56,260 --> 01:17:58,887
- Hey, big boy.
- Slow down.

812
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:08,272
What the hell?

813
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:24,872
Okay, marine,
this is for real!

814
01:18:29,168 --> 01:18:30,669
Yah!

815
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:31,753
Let's go!

816
01:18:35,048 --> 01:18:38,468
Go, go, go, go!
Come on, come on!

817
01:18:50,355 --> 01:18:53,567
What the hell
is going on?

818
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:07,664
Ahh!

819
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:23,972
Is somebody trapped
in there?

820
01:20:47,181 --> 01:20:48,056
For God's sake!

821
01:21:00,777 --> 01:21:02,154
Look at that!

822
01:21:39,775 --> 01:21:41,777
Mother of God.

823
01:21:46,281 --> 01:21:47,449
Mom.

824
01:21:47,574 --> 01:21:48,575
Boo!

825
01:21:51,954 --> 01:21:55,457
Hey, where are you
going with my car?

826
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:58,752
Daddy, help me! Daddy!
Daddy, help me!

827
01:21:58,877 --> 01:21:59,753
Help, Daddy!

828
01:21:59,878 --> 01:22:01,588
Daddy, help me!

829
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:08,971
Frank, take it easy.

830
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:11,056
I checked everywhere.

831
01:22:11,056 --> 01:22:13,058
There aren't any witnesses.

832
01:22:13,058 --> 01:22:15,853
That's New York for you.

833
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:18,480
Twenty people standing around.
Nobody saw a thing.

834
01:22:18,564 --> 01:22:21,358
Tell me about Matunas.
Is he on drugs?

835
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:22,860
He's a survival nut.

836
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:24,361
What?

837
01:22:24,486 --> 01:22:26,363
He was a marine.

838
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:29,366
His ex-c.o. said
he was paranoid...

839
01:22:29,366 --> 01:22:32,369
but he was a good man.

840
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:34,371
How you doing, kid?

841
01:22:34,454 --> 01:22:37,082
Okay, for a guy who got three feet
of steel crammed through his gut.

842
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:38,584
How you doing?

843
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:42,379
I understand
you saw who stuck you?

844
01:22:42,588 --> 01:22:44,256
You kidding me, man?

845
01:22:44,256 --> 01:22:45,966
Is that him?

846
01:22:46,049 --> 01:22:47,259
Nope.

847
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:50,179
Quit kidding, Matunas.
It was dark in that alley.

848
01:22:50,262 --> 01:22:52,681
The freak was trying to kill me!

849
01:22:52,764 --> 01:22:56,185
He had a scar
across his neck.

850
01:22:56,268 --> 01:22:58,187
That ain't him.

851
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,855
Shit.

852
01:23:02,357 --> 01:23:03,775
Depressed?

853
01:23:03,775 --> 01:23:05,277
Yeah.

854
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,488
You don't know grunt
about depressed.

855
01:23:08,488 --> 01:23:10,866
I got me a .357.

856
01:23:10,949 --> 01:23:13,368
Got me a trunk load
of shotguns.

857
01:23:13,452 --> 01:23:15,579
I got three big-bore
battle rifles...

858
01:23:15,662 --> 01:23:16,663
ammo up the ass...

859
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:18,582
and I ain't safe!

860
01:23:18,665 --> 01:23:20,250
I can't protect myself!

861
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,252
Okay, take it easy, pal.

862
01:23:22,252 --> 01:23:24,171
That weirdo, man.

863
01:23:24,254 --> 01:23:27,382
He got up after I put
enough lead in him...

864
01:23:27,382 --> 01:23:28,884
to drop a rhino.

865
01:23:28,884 --> 01:23:31,178
Hey, listen,
could you work...

866
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,263
with one of our artists?

867
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:35,766
Get a picture of this guy?

868
01:23:35,849 --> 01:23:37,976
Sure, sure.

869
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,188
Thanks.
Take it easy, pal.

870
01:23:41,188 --> 01:23:42,648
Hey, cop.

871
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:43,774
Yeah.

872
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:46,568
I know you guys
think I'm nuts...

873
01:23:46,652 --> 01:23:49,655
but there's something else
I gotta tell you.

874
01:23:49,780 --> 01:23:53,158
After he threw me
against the wall...

875
01:24:12,678 --> 01:24:14,471
This is like
"One Step Beyond".

876
01:24:14,555 --> 01:24:17,182
All we got is an eyewitness.

877
01:24:17,182 --> 01:24:19,476
Don't say anything
about sword fights...

878
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,562
or guys glowing in the dark
for Christ's sake.

879
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:24,648
Hey, Moran!

880
01:24:24,773 --> 01:24:26,650
Have you read this?

881
01:24:26,775 --> 01:24:30,863
Are you kidding?
You know cops can't read.

882
01:24:30,988 --> 01:24:33,782
What does "incompetent" mean?

883
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:35,284
That mayor.

884
01:24:35,284 --> 01:24:39,288
He calls me at 2:00
in the morning.

885
01:24:39,371 --> 01:24:42,249
I don't answer
the phone anymore.

886
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:45,085
What does "baffled" mean?

887
01:25:16,283 --> 01:25:19,786
Karen Joan Nash.

888
01:25:19,786 --> 01:25:22,748
Yeah, I remember her.

889
01:25:22,748 --> 01:25:25,250
I was practicing
in Syracuse.

890
01:25:25,250 --> 01:25:27,753
Didn't get many of these.

891
01:25:27,753 --> 01:25:29,254
What?

892
01:25:29,254 --> 01:25:30,756
Unwed mothers.

893
01:25:30,756 --> 01:25:33,383
Nowadays, that's no big deal.

894
01:25:33,467 --> 01:25:36,470
Back then, in Syracuse...

895
01:25:36,553 --> 01:25:39,264
that was a stoning offense.

896
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:40,849
What happened?

897
01:25:40,974 --> 01:25:44,186
She had the baby,
and she died.

898
01:25:44,269 --> 01:25:45,687
So Nash was illegitimate.

899
01:25:45,771 --> 01:25:48,357
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, he was illegitimate...

900
01:25:48,482 --> 01:25:50,859
for about a minute and a half.

901
01:25:50,984 --> 01:25:53,278
He died right after she did.

902
01:25:57,574 --> 01:25:59,368
He died.

903
01:26:09,753 --> 01:26:10,671
Hello, Brenda.

904
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:12,673
I did what you asked.

905
01:26:12,756 --> 01:26:16,552
I went through the deeds
to Nash's house...

906
01:26:16,677 --> 01:26:19,054
back through
five previous owners...

907
01:26:19,054 --> 01:26:22,182
to the original guy,
Montague, in 1796.

908
01:26:22,266 --> 01:26:23,684
In all five instances...

909
01:26:23,684 --> 01:26:24,768
Montague through Nash...

910
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:26,270
I found a death certificate...

911
01:26:26,353 --> 01:26:28,480
for a kid with the same name...

912
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:29,982
who died at birth...

913
01:26:30,065 --> 01:26:33,569
years before he pretended to sign
for his inheritance.

914
01:26:33,652 --> 01:26:36,864
Jesus, Rick, isn't there
any heat in here?

915
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:39,658
No. Heat's bad
for the circuits.

916
01:26:39,783 --> 01:26:42,286
In case
there's any doubt...

917
01:27:02,556 --> 01:27:04,683
So, what you've
got here, Brenda...

918
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:07,769
is a guy who's been
creeping around...

919
01:27:07,853 --> 01:27:09,479
since at least 1700...

920
01:27:09,479 --> 01:27:11,982
pretending to croak
every so often.

921
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:13,483
Leaving all his goods...

922
01:27:13,483 --> 01:27:15,986
to kids who've been
corpses for years...

923
01:27:15,986 --> 01:27:18,488
and assuming
their identities.

924
01:27:23,785 --> 01:27:27,956
It's not possible.

925
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:29,458
"Post" final!

926
01:27:29,583 --> 01:27:31,877
Cops release
headhunter picture!

927
01:27:31,877 --> 01:27:33,378
Reward offered.

928
01:27:33,378 --> 01:27:34,379
I'll take a "Post".

929
01:27:34,463 --> 01:27:36,048
Headhunter revealed!

930
01:28:09,748 --> 01:28:13,168
For you, my bonny Heather.

931
01:28:13,252 --> 01:28:15,254
Happy birthday.

932
01:28:17,256 --> 01:28:21,176
And you, Juan Ramirez.

933
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,888
Take care of her,
you overdressed haggis.

934
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:03,760
Kastagir is gone.

935
01:29:03,886 --> 01:29:06,263
Only you and I remain.

936
01:29:13,687 --> 01:29:16,648
Nice to see you, Kurgan.

937
01:29:16,773 --> 01:29:18,859
Who cuts your hair?

938
01:29:18,984 --> 01:29:22,154
I am in disguise.

939
01:29:22,279 --> 01:29:26,074
This way no one
will recognize me.

940
01:29:28,452 --> 01:29:29,786
I do.

941
01:29:31,288 --> 01:29:33,248
What do you want?

942
01:29:33,373 --> 01:29:35,667
- Your head.

943
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:37,669
And the prize.

944
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:42,049
Watch.

945
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:45,052
Happy Halloween, ladies!

946
01:29:45,177 --> 01:29:47,387
Blah, blah.

947
01:29:47,471 --> 01:29:48,972
Blah.

948
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,850
Blah, blah, blah.

949
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:56,772
Nuns. No sense of humor.

950
01:29:56,855 --> 01:30:01,151
Ramirez's blade did not
cut deeply enough.

951
01:30:01,276 --> 01:30:04,863
He was right about you.
You're slime.

952
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:07,157
Ramirez was an effete snob!

953
01:30:07,282 --> 01:30:09,660
He died on his knees!

954
01:30:09,785 --> 01:30:13,664
I took his head
and raped his woman...

955
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:17,084
before his blood
was even cold!

956
01:30:25,259 --> 01:30:27,177
I see.

957
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:30,389
Ramirez lied.

958
01:30:32,766 --> 01:30:35,686
She was not his woman.

959
01:30:35,769 --> 01:30:37,855
She was your woman...

960
01:30:37,980 --> 01:30:41,775
and she never told you.

961
01:30:41,775 --> 01:30:44,278
I wonder why.

962
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,780
Perhaps I gave her something...

963
01:30:46,864 --> 01:30:49,283
you never could...

964
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:55,789
and secretly she yearned
for my return.

965
01:30:55,789 --> 01:30:58,750
Holy ground, Highlander!

966
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:01,587
Remember what
Ramirez taught you.

967
01:31:05,382 --> 01:31:08,886
You can't stay
in here forever.

968
01:31:11,555 --> 01:31:13,765
You are weak, Highlander.

969
01:31:13,765 --> 01:31:19,688
You will always be
weaker than l.

970
01:31:23,483 --> 01:31:25,485
I'll be out front.

971
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:31,658
Goodbye, Macleod.

972
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:35,579
We will meet soon enough.

973
01:31:45,255 --> 01:31:48,050
This is the house of God.

974
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:50,385
People are trying to pray.

975
01:31:50,469 --> 01:31:51,970
You're disturbing them.

976
01:31:53,764 --> 01:31:58,185
He cares about
these helpless mortals?

977
01:31:58,268 --> 01:32:00,187
Of course he cares.

978
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:02,648
He died for our sins.

979
01:32:02,773 --> 01:32:05,150
That shall be his undoing.

980
01:32:07,152 --> 01:32:09,655
Father...

981
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:11,657
forgive me!

982
01:32:11,782 --> 01:32:14,785
I am a worm.

983
01:32:27,381 --> 01:32:30,050
I have something to say!

984
01:32:30,175 --> 01:32:32,386
It's better to burn out...

985
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:35,180
than to fade away!

986
01:32:43,188 --> 01:32:44,982
I need to see him, goddamn it!

987
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:46,984
I'm afraid that's impossible.

988
01:32:46,984 --> 01:32:48,861
Mr. Nash is...

989
01:32:48,986 --> 01:32:50,654
Mr. Nash is dead.

990
01:32:52,281 --> 01:32:55,284
What are you doing here?

991
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:57,953
I'm looking for
a dead guy named Nash.

992
01:32:57,953 --> 01:33:00,163
He died at birth
in Syracuse, New York.

993
01:33:04,877 --> 01:33:07,588
All right.

994
01:33:07,588 --> 01:33:09,548
Come on.

995
01:33:36,575 --> 01:33:38,660
Are the Claymores real?

996
01:33:40,078 --> 01:33:41,580
What is this, a museum?

997
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:44,166
This stuff
must be worth a fortune.

998
01:33:53,050 --> 01:33:56,678
I've been alive
for 4 1/2 centuries.

999
01:33:56,762 --> 01:33:58,555
I cannot die.

1000
01:33:58,680 --> 01:34:00,849
Huh.

1001
01:34:00,974 --> 01:34:03,560
Well, everybody's
got their problems.

1002
01:34:08,482 --> 01:34:12,277
What are you going
to do with that?

1003
01:34:12,361 --> 01:34:13,862
Take it.

1004
01:34:27,376 --> 01:34:31,588
I am Connor Macleod
of the Clan Macleod.

1005
01:34:31,672 --> 01:34:33,882
I was born in 1518...

1006
01:34:33,882 --> 01:34:35,884
in the village of Glenfinnan...

1007
01:34:35,884 --> 01:34:38,387
on the shores of Loch Shiel...

1008
01:34:38,387 --> 01:34:40,681
and I am immortal.

1009
01:36:20,364 --> 01:36:21,782
You're not listening.

1010
01:36:21,865 --> 01:36:23,784
Brenda, it isn't going to work.

1011
01:36:23,784 --> 01:36:25,786
I can't get involved.
Not again.

1012
01:36:38,549 --> 01:36:40,551
You know what's weird?

1013
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:43,554
Most people are
afraid to die.

1014
01:36:43,554 --> 01:36:46,056
That's not your problem.

1015
01:36:46,974 --> 01:36:48,559
You're afraid to live.

1016
01:36:53,689 --> 01:36:56,066
Take care of yourself.

1017
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:57,776
Don't lose your head.

1018
01:37:13,667 --> 01:37:15,961
Hello, pretty.

1019
01:37:19,965 --> 01:37:23,260
Come on!
Open up!

1020
01:37:29,766 --> 01:37:32,269
Oh, my!

1021
01:37:54,583 --> 01:37:56,084
Have you ever
played chicken?

1022
01:38:00,881 --> 01:38:02,674
Here we go!

1023
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:07,262
Watch out!

1024
01:38:43,048 --> 01:38:45,050
Excuse me!

1025
01:38:47,386 --> 01:38:49,179
Oh, no!

1026
01:39:07,281 --> 01:39:09,658
Watch out! A truck!

1027
01:39:09,783 --> 01:39:11,785
Look out!

1028
01:39:34,766 --> 01:39:35,684
Shut up.

1029
01:39:37,853 --> 01:39:39,563
Sing along...

1030
01:39:39,688 --> 01:39:41,857
Shut up!

1031
01:39:47,863 --> 01:39:49,281
Shut up!

1032
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:52,951
Shut up!

1033
01:40:29,988 --> 01:40:32,366
I can entertain myself.

1034
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:35,077
Your friend is a real screamer.
Listen.

1035
01:40:36,370 --> 01:40:39,665
Which part should
I cut off first?

1036
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:41,750
I'll be waiting.

1037
01:40:47,673 --> 01:40:50,676
The endless killing
has driven him mad.

1038
01:40:50,676 --> 01:40:53,178
Rachel, there are instructions
in the desk drawer.

1039
01:40:53,178 --> 01:40:55,180
I want you to follow them.

1040
01:40:55,180 --> 01:40:57,683
There's a power of attorney
for you.

1041
01:40:57,683 --> 01:41:00,269
You'll have everything you need.

1042
01:41:00,352 --> 01:41:02,187
You're not coming back.

1043
01:41:03,188 --> 01:41:04,648
Even if you kill him...

1044
01:41:04,648 --> 01:41:07,150
you're not coming back...

1045
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:08,485
are you?

1046
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,079
Sweet Rachel.

1047
01:41:19,162 --> 01:41:22,958
You always knew
this would happen.

1048
01:41:23,083 --> 01:41:25,377
Russell Nash dies tonight.

1049
01:41:40,350 --> 01:41:43,854
Hey...
it's a kind of magic.

1050
01:41:52,487 --> 01:41:54,781
Goodbye, Russell Nash.

1051
01:47:12,850 --> 01:47:15,352
So now it ends.

1052
01:47:33,579 --> 01:47:35,080
What kept you?

1053
01:49:50,382 --> 01:49:52,968
There can be only one!

1054
01:50:25,751 --> 01:50:28,754
The quickening overpowers me!

1055
01:50:32,674 --> 01:50:35,677
I know!
I know everything!

1056
01:50:35,886 --> 01:50:38,055
I am everything!

1057
01:51:38,282 --> 01:51:40,951
this is where it all began.

1058
01:51:41,076 --> 01:51:43,954
Can you tell me
about the prize?

1059
01:51:43,954 --> 01:51:46,957
It's like a whirlwind
in my head.

1060
01:51:46,957 --> 01:51:48,375
But if I concentrate...

1061
01:51:48,458 --> 01:51:50,377
I know what people
are thinking...

1062
01:51:50,460 --> 01:51:52,087
all over the world.

1063
01:51:52,087 --> 01:51:53,255
Presidents...

1064
01:51:53,380 --> 01:51:54,464
diplomats...

1065
01:51:54,548 --> 01:51:56,175
scientists.

1066
01:51:56,258 --> 01:51:59,178
I can help them
understand each other.

1067
01:52:00,262 --> 01:52:01,555
What am I thinking?

1068
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:02,556
You're thinking...

1069
01:52:02,681 --> 01:52:05,559
whether or not
you can love me.

1070
01:52:05,684 --> 01:52:07,561
You can.
I'm just like you.

1071
01:52:07,686 --> 01:52:09,563
I can love and
have children.

1072
01:52:09,688 --> 01:52:11,481
Live and grow old.

1073
01:52:11,565 --> 01:52:14,067
You never prepared
me for that...

1074
01:52:14,067 --> 01:52:15,485
you Spanish peacock.

1075
01:52:17,279 --> 01:52:19,364
Patience, Highlander.

1076
01:52:19,448 --> 01:52:21,783
You have done well.

1077
01:52:21,867 --> 01:52:23,952
But it'll take time.

1078
01:52:24,077 --> 01:52:29,374
You are generations
being born and dying.

1079
01:52:29,458 --> 01:52:31,877
You are at one
with all living things.

1080
01:52:31,960 --> 01:52:35,255
Each man's thoughts and dreams
are yours to know.

1081
01:52:36,965 --> 01:52:39,885
You have power beyond imagination.

1082
01:52:39,968 --> 01:52:42,679
Use it well, my friend.

1083
01:52:42,763 --> 01:52:44,848
Don't lose your head.
