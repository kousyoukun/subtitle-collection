<i>Right now, it's about
55 degrees and cloudy,</i>

<i>Peace, Chicago. Let's do this!</i>

7
00:00:43,669 --> 00:00:44,716

<i>But to me, you're much more than that.</i>

17

<i>My first kiss,</i>

00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:25,545
<i>And first ass-whooping
from Boobie Monroe.</i>

24
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:31,016
<i>And of course, my first love,
my wife, Jennifer,</i>

25
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:35,055
<i>who gave me the greatest gift

00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,816
You know how we do.
South Side Chicago, baby!

29
00:01:47,983 --> 00:01:50,111
South Side, baby.
Yes, sir, 79th Street all day.

30
00:01:50,277 --> 00:01:51,449
- Yes, sir.
- It don't stop.

31
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,613
<i>I just</i> wanna <i>say thank you.</i>

32

For <i>what?</i>

33
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,073
For introducing me to Rashad.

34
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,366
Ah, y'all gonna be divorced in a minute.

35
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,035
On.

36
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:00,078
No, I'm just playing with you.

37
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:01,921
<i>Not to mention,</i>

38
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,627
<i>lifelong friendship</i>

40

And the <i>birth</i> of a new era.

41
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,386
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!

42
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:15,182
<i>So I hope you know
it's out of love that I say this.</i>

43
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,345
<i>But recently,</i>

44
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,889
<i>things ain't been the same
between me and you.</i>

45
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,475
<i>Lately, you've been out of control.</i>

46

<i>REPORTER". At least 24 people
were shot and injured.</i>

47
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,738
<i>Police believe most shootings
were gang-related.</i>

48
00:02:26,897 --> 00:02:29,195
<i>And I'm not the only one
that feels this way, Chicago.</i>

49
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,660
We've just gone to a new low.
When you now...

50
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,240
<i>There used to be a day
when there was a code.</i>

51
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,620
<i>You didn't kill children.
You didn't kill mothers.</i>

52
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,533
<i>You didn't kill grandmothers.
There is no boundary.</i>

53
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:39,584
Children are dying in the street.

54
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,120
We have to stop the violence.

55
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,705
<i>The streets are talking.</i>

56
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:44,418
<i>They're tired.</i>

57
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,801
<i>- They're angry.</i>

<i>WBBM news time, 6:32.</i>

Violence on Chicago's streets

60
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,777
<i>took no holiday for the long weekend.</i>

61
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,937
<i>Police say at least
eight people were killed,</i>

62
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,989
<i>at least 20 others wounded
in shootings since Thursday.</i>

63
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,196
<i>That's an increase over

<i>that saw five killed and 14 wounded.</i>

65
00:03:15,112 --> 00:03:16,159
Oh, Lord.

66
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:17,830
Hey, Eddie. What's up, man?

67
00:03:18,657 --> 00:03:20,580
Calvin, I messed up this time, man.

68
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,743
I'm telling you. I did something wrong.

69
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:22,911
What?

70
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:25,297
There's a bunch of them Gangster Disciples
down there on the corner,

71
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,672
with their pants hanging
all around their ankles.

72
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,376
And I told them how they was a bunch
of conjugal visits gone bad.

73
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,461
And they're coming down here.
They're coming after me, Calvin.

74
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,050
- I need the strap!
- Strap?

75
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,343
I need the heat! Where's the heater?

76
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:35,553
Ain't no heat in here, man.

77
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:36,717
The gun! The gat!

78
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,009
There ain't no gun in this shop.

79
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:39,640
So we ain't got no gun?

80
00:03:39,845 --> 00:03:41,267
They're about to come in here with AKs

81
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,773
and 47s and Desert Eagles,

82
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,525
and we got nothing but witch hazel!

83
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,649
Eddie. Are you serious?
Because I don't see nobody.

84
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,106
Here they come!

85
00:03:50,272 --> 00:03:51,319
- Where?
- Come on!

86
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,529
Come on, Calvin! Come on!

87
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,361
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

88
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,029
Shit, man.

89
00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:58,196
What are we gonna do?

90
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:02,334
You know what, I talked my way into this,

91
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:04,377
maybe I can talk my way out of it.

92
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,334
Man, we can go out the back.
Let's just go out the back!

93
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,373
I can't run, Calvin. I'm old.

94
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,883
- Let's go.
-l'm just gonna talk to them.

95
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,167
They're young boys,
and I'm gonna talk to them.

96
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,336
Listen, you're not going out there!

97
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:15,013
Let me get something. Just wait.

98
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,674
Calvin! Don't.

99
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,886
There we go.

100
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,680
<i>Let's be reasonable.</i>

101
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,391
<i>Everybody just calm down.
Let me just talk to you.</i>

102
00:04:25,724 --> 00:04:27,692
<i>- Everybody stay cool-headed.
- Shit.</i>

103
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:30,195
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
<i>- Just give</i> me one of--

104
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,230
Leave that man alone! Black lives matter!

105
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,191
He's old and decrepit!

106
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,695
<i>Pedro, Feliz Navidad.</i>

107
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:40,201
Eddie.

108
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,364
You want some?

109
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:43,124
- Man.
- I got you.

110
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,876
I'm tired of this, Eddie.

111
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,042
That sandwich was hand-crafted.

112
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,714
<i>And you should have heard!</i>

113
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,055
"Black lives matter!"

114
00:04:58,215 --> 00:04:59,967
"Eddie, don't go out there,
they're gonna kill ya!"

115
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,977
He was quivering like
Terrence Howard at the Oscars.

116
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,558
See, Eddie, that's your problem.

117
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,938
You play too damn much, man.

118
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,940
One day, somebody gonna be
chasing your ass for real.

119
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,942
You know what I'mma do?
I'mma let them catch you.

120
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,440
Oh, okay, okay.

121
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:14,239
You know the rules, baby boy.

122
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,694
If you like it, you pay.

123
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,404
If you don't like it,
your ass pay anyway.

124
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,069
Nice. Nice.

125
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,495
Well, Isaac,

126
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,701
it's good running into you again.

127
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:28,833
Man, she know
she ain't never ran a day in her life.

128
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,583
You gonna call me, right?

129
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,214
Oh, uh-huh.

130
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,419
You crazy.

131
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,596
All right. Ow.

132
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:40,174
Yes!

133
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,266
All right, Soror.
Girl, I'll talk to you later.

134
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:43,426
Bye.

135
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,765
You know you my girl and--

136
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:46,271
<i>All right, baby girl.</i>

137
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,473
See you around.

138
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,808
Damn!

139
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,194
What happened to the barbershop, Calvin?

140
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,774
I used to come here
to get away from women.

141
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:57,445
Especially the ones I'll never ever
wanna see again as long as I live.

142
00:05:57,607 --> 00:06:00,076
You know you love the ladies,
especially the sisters.

143
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,953
Yeah, it's true, I like the sisters. I do.

144
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,451
Just not that one.

145
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,615
But homegirl in a catsuit,
though, she could get it.

146
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:06,867
What's good, ma?

147
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,034


148
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:10,795
What them
pockets do, little daddy?

149
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,831
You can come over here
and frisk me if you like.

150
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,593
Now, I'm gonna keep it
real here for a second.

151
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,507
This was a male sanctuary.

152
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,672
This is the original man cave.

153
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,386
<i>And now, it's just</i> a <i>club,</i>

154
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,472
with the lights on, and no drinks.

155
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,806
On.

156
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,437
Yo, Isaac. It is what it is, man.

157
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,355
The recession ain't never
left the South Side.

158
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:31,312
Joining forces saved us both.

159
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,814
- Well, change is good.
- Mmm-hmm.

Hey, Aisha!

172
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,540
I told you!

He like them big like that.

'What up. Pimpin'?

178
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:07,052

What up, J, Bree, Angie?

181
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,847
- Hey, Rashad.
- Morning, Rashad.

182
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,061
- Hey, yo, boy.
- Cal, what up?

183
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,315
- What's up with you, man?
- You good?

184
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:14,476
- Good, I'm good.
- A'ight.

185
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,685
<i>Seriously.</i>

186
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:16,944
Your girl does need to be careful

187
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,364
wearing all of that
red and gold down 79th.

188
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,399
Yeah, man. The Vice Lords don't play that.

189
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,819
You can't just wear their colors
and walk down the street unchecked.

190
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:25,783
Man, the streets is crazy right now.

191
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,448
I damn near got robbed the other day.

192
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,866
I did get robbed the other day.

193
00:07:29,032 --> 00:07:32,377
What? Man, I got robbed twice
on the same day on the same block.

194
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,004
That ain't shit.

195
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,039
Last week, I got robbed twice

196
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,379
and got my ass beat by the second robber

197
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,168
for giving all my money to the first.

198
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,383
She wasn't playing.

199
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,052
I've been living on
the South Side since '52.

200
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,843
I've been robbed,
been shot, been stabbed.

201
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,886
Hell, been stoned, been groped,

202
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,513
and almost lynched twice.

203
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,682
Nobody tried to lynch your musty ass.

204
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:56,567
The only reason I'm still here
is because the first time,

205
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:57,978
they didn't know how to tie the knot.

206
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,942
So I just slipped right out.

207
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:01,485
<i>And second time,</i>

208
00:08:01,648 --> 00:08:03,400
the tree was too short.

209
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,409
Hey, Calvin, I finished reorganizing
that supply closet.

210
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:09,739
You want me to sweep before I go?

211
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:10,953
- No, man.
- You sure?

212
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,459
No. No, go on ahead to school.

213
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,460
- You sure, man?
- Yeah, man, positive.

214
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:16,041
- Here you go.
- Man, I appreciate that for sure.

215
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,251
I appreciate it, too.

216
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,127
-I'm gonna see you again next week.
- Okay.

217
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,712
- Take care, Angie.
- You <i>be</i> careful out there.

218
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,510
- Bye, Anthony.
- All right, y'all.

219
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:24,592
- All right, man. Thanks!
- All right, Chris Beige.

220
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,880
Now, don't get robbed.

221
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,048
Oh, you a trip.

222
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,432
<i>Rashad, your son's here!</i>

223
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,968
Hey, what up, everybody? Hey, Angie.

224
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,352
<i>There you go, double trouble.</i>

225
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,763
- What's up, Eddie?
- Good.

226
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,431
Hey, what's up, Dad? How's everything?

227
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:37,442
Pretty good.
Shouldn't you two be at school by now?

228
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,852
Yeah, we on our way.

229
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,862
I just stopped by because
I need to borrow $20.

230
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,231
Dad, come on, I need it.

231
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,441
Angie, you got 20 bucks?

232
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:45,608
Oh, yeah, I got 20.

233
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,075
- Yo, Rashad, you got a dub on you?
- Yes, sir. What up, son?

234
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,035
Does everybody in here that's working...

235
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,289
KENNY; What up, Dad?

236
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:53,792
...got at least $20
in their pocket or purse?

237
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,044
- Yeah, I do.
- 4ndeed,ldo.

238
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:58,751
Uh, I had $20, but I got robbed.

239
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,336
That was serious, I ain't make that up.

240
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,671
That bitch was swole.

241
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:05,254
Not now, Dante. Not now.

242
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,467
Do you know what all these
people got in common?

243
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,056
They old?

244
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,309
- Hold on now.

245
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:12,469
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

246
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,637
You know, you ain't too grown
to get your butt whooped.

247
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,772
Cal, you want me to take
care of this for you?

248
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,649
- No, I got this.
- Okay.

249
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:19,809
Relax, Adrian Peterson.

250
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,649
It's 2016, not 1816.

251
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,031
You can't pull kids pants down and spank
their bottoms until it turns red.

252
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,612
It's illegal and a little creepy.

253
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:28,618
Ain't nobody talking
about that Catholic school you went to.

254
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,495
Do I look like Father Flanagan?

255
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,410
When I was growing up,

So, can we maybe get back to the $20?

258
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,671
Whatever happened to you coming around

259
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,831
after school every now and then
and helping out?

260
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,421
Dad, come on. You know
I'm busy with homework and basketball.

261
00:09:44,626 --> 00:09:45,843
We've been busy with work.

<i>You don't work, you don't get paid. Okay?</i>

264
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,601

A'ig ht.

266
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,935
And I better not find out that
you're late to that school.

267
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,683
Told you, man.

268
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,850
Hey, Kenny.

269
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,061

<i>I saw you, Kenny.</i>

272
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,441
Those candy bars

<i>I'm not playing.</i>

And he don't make that much.

276
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,826
Not to put your business out there,
but Terri does make more.

277
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,374

318
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,684
Hey, you know, trying to do my thing.

319
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:01,513
Man, Coach already talking about
bumpin' him up to varsity next year.

320
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,807
Word? That's good, man.
Keep putting in work.

321
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,559
<i>You know, that's how you
get to the big leagues,</i>

322
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,147
<i>like D-Rose and D-Wade.</i>

323
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,945
Y'all need anything though?
Y'all straight?

324
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:11,356
We cool.

325
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,991
I got somethin' for y'all, man.

326
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,198
I know how it be, being a little homie.
You know?

327
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,238
I know y'all cool, be cooler.

328
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,826
Ben Frank style.

329
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,162
Gotta keep the little homies fresh,
you feel me?

330
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,702
Yo, thanks, Yummy.

331
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,711
Y'all gonna be family soon anyway, right?

332
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,539
- Fo'sho?
- Yeah.

333
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:29,629
There's a lot more where that came from.

334
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,759
- So get used to it.
- All right, Yummy.

335
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,049
-I'll holler at you, J.
- All right.

336
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,472
Yo!

337
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,299
Girl, keep the change.

338
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,184
- You like it?
- Mmm-hmm.

339
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,764
Damn, I see you
getting that chop over there, girl.

340
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:44,931
Yes, I am.

341
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:46,350
How much you charge for them weaves?

342
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:49,562
Well, it depends.
'Cause if you wanna be basic-ass

343
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,729
No, No, No Destiny's Child Beyoncé,

344
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,739
that's gonna cost you, like, $200.

345
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,859
If you wanna be like,
you know, Cater2 <i>U</i> Beyoncé,

346
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,402
that's gonna cost you, like, $600.

347
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:01,035
And if you wanna be
Beyoncé featuring Jay Z...

348
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,666
- Boom, boom.
- Mmm.

349
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,535
That's gonna cost you, like, a stack.

350
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,587
I can't believe y'all
spend all that money on weaves anyway.

351
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,585
Next thing you know, you gonna be just

352
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,797
high-jacking and robbing
Puerto Ricans for their hair.

353
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:16,341
Eddie, the only hair
getting stolen around here is Indian hair.

354
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,048
It's lush, it's beautiful,

355
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,592
and it's infused with coconut oil
right out the womb, okay?

356
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,177
<i>That's why all y'all want it.</i>

357
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:25,392
Man, I can't believe
y'all put all that money on your heads,

358
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:27,683
and then don't be having
no money for your rent.

359
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,109
Excuse you, this is how I pay my rent.

360
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:31,645
Exactly.

361
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:34,030
'Cause with this hair and this booty,

362
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:36,031
it's like walking around
with a black AmEx.

363
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,984
And I never get denied.

364
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:39,698
I bet you don't.

365
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,909
Y'all in here complaining
about our weaves,

366
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,490
but y'all negroes know good and well

367
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,910
that you'd drop-kick Lupita
to get to Kim Kardashian.

368
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,753
- Even the non-negroes.
- Mmm-hmm.

369
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:50,458
Oh, especially the non...

370
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,249
Can I say negroes?

371
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,001
Carefully, very carefully.

372
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,341
Say it slow so we can
hear all the syllables.

373
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:58,588
Mmm-hmm.

374
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,093
Just be remorseful when you say it.

375
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,099
Cool. Negroes.

376
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,270
As the only non-negro
in the room, I'd like to say,

377
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:08,181
Lupita's got a Dark Caesar,
and it's one of my most requested cuts.

378
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:09,395
<i>Lupita?</i>

379
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,401
Man, don't nobody want
no bald head chick in real life.

380
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,609
Even Kanye got rid of Amber
for Kim's sexy ass.

381
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:19,402
Every day, y'all in here complaining
about fake weaves and fake asses,

382
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,320
but all the girls that
you like on lnstagram have exactly that.

383
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:24,489
Fake weaves and fake asses.

384
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,282
- No offense, Draya.
- None taken, girl.

385
00:14:26,449 --> 00:14:27,917
We winning and y'all ain't.

386
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:30,295
I mean, but that's what dudes want,
they want that fantasy.

387
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:33,465
Yeah, a fantasy that you still expect us
real women to live up to.

388
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:35,375
What? Men are visual, all right?
What's the problem?

389
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,542
Oh, and women aren't?

390
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,963
I mean, you don't think we want some nice,
thick, sexy lips to suck on,

391
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,473
and some nice big broad shoulders,

392
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:46,307
and a dick print that
you can see from here to the Sears Tower?

393
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:47,720
Preach.

394
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,555
Mmm.

395
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,480
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Hey! The language!</i>

396
00:14:52,725 --> 00:14:54,568
Watch your mouth in here.
Angie, get your girl.

397
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:56,320
Oh. Sorry, Mr. Cal.

398
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,741
You know what the
whole problem with your generation is?

399
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,701
You don't know how to do nothing,
need to learn a skill.

400
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:03,945
Learn how to mop a floor.

401
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:06,160
You know what I'm saying? Iron.

402
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,501
Your phone die,
you wouldn't know how to spell a sentence.

403
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,291
Smart phone, dumb girls!

404
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:16,249
Learn how to cook a decent meal,
for goodness' sake.

405
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:18,760
Look, some of them
don't even know how to microwave.

406
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,795
Had a girl come over
to my house last week,

407
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,010
went into my kitchen,
thought mine was a safe.

408
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:26,013
I bet that shit was empty.

409
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,511
Ooh.

410
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:29,471
And I can't believe you, Eddie.

411
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,140
I can't believe that you
expect your visual fantasy

412
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:36,027
to actually mop and iron
for your old ass?

413
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:39,530
You come over to my house,
you better know how to clean and iron.

414
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:41,691
Only thing gonna be
wrinkling around my house

415
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:44,953
is my forehead when I say,
"Bitch, what?"

416
00:15:47,155 --> 00:15:48,452
You need manners.

417
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,409
<i>- Yeah, Angie.</i>
<i>- Please!</i>

418
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:55,126
It doesn't matter how much a woman tries
to live up to your fantasies.

419
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:59,714
Doesn't matter if a woman tries to wash
your crusty-ass drawers every night.

420
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:02,880
Doesn't matter if she
fixes him a special batch of vegan chili,

421
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:05,673
even though chili
is supposed to have meat in it!

422
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,389
<i>Everybody knows that chili has meat in it!</i>

423
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,019
That's what it is, it doesn't matter,

424
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:11,395
because he's still gonna
wake up one morning

425
00:16:11,554 --> 00:16:13,556
and leave your ass
for some chick on lnstagram!

426
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,356
Who had sex with you
and didn't appreciate it?

427
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:19,945
Vegan chili is delicious.

428
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,693
Trust me on this, ladies.

429
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:23,779
The only man that you can
trust is the one up above.

430
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,988
<i>Come on, Bree.</i>

431
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,866
That dude, Ronnie,
he was just a bad apple.

432
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,863
<i>If you and your man
had something real,</i>

433
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,909
it wouldn't have mattered
how bad the lnstagram ho was.

434
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,917
She wouldn't have
been able to come between y'all.

435
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,249
Not even for Jamaicanthickthighs24?

436
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,005
Jerrod.

437
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:40,754
Ass so fat you can see it from the front.

438
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,294
- Let me see.
- Send me that.

439
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,803
- Yeah, right there.
- Oh, there is a God.

440
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,759
- Smell that.
-It's not scratch-and-sniff.

441
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,299
<i>Ass cheeks so separated...</i>

442
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:48,640
You know what, ladies?

443
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,726
For years it has been a war,

444
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,429
with the good girls and the hoes,

445
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,438
and the hoes have officially won.

446
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,812
Go, hoes!

447
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,897
Love me some hoes.
I can't live without hoes.

448
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,102
I gotta have them.

449
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,948
Hoes know what to do
and when to do it!

450
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,608
<i>Wait. Wait. Hold up!</i>

451
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:08,990
You girls keep complaining
about the chauvinistic talk in the shop,

452
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,281
but y'all do the same thing in reverse.

453
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,745
Each one of y'all want a super thug

454
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:16,624
that can hold his own
on the yard at the Cook County jail,

455
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,710
that's got three degrees from
Harvard and making six figures.

456
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:20,873
You know it.

457
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,509
Meanwhile, you pass up
corny dudes like Jerrod every day.

458
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,256
<i>DANTE". Mmm. Exactly.</i>

459
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:29,219
Don't no woman want no moist
Duncan Hines-ass dude like Jerrod.

460
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,056
- No.
- Jerrod's like boiled okra.

461
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,887
He's just green, stringy,

462
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,431
just completely unappetizing
to the human palate.

463
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:37,811
Wow.

464
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:39,351
Such kind words, you guys.
I really appreciate it.

465
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,692
<i>Uh. A couple things.</i>

466
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,320
First of all, I'm standing right here.
I can hear you.

467
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:44,696
And second of all--

468
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,944
Baller alert!

469
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,821
<i>No, he did not just pull up
in</i> a <i>Maserati, girl!</i>

470
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:49,986
<i>ls that L. Rock from the Bears?
Oh, my God.</i>

471
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,530
<i>He just got a $47 million contract.</i>

472
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,792
Thirty-five guaranteed
and four with incentives.

473
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,625
Craig came by here 20 minutes ago
looking for you.

474
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:01,004
Okay, thanks, Cal. I'll text him.

475
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,164
Hey,babe.

476
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,083
I need you to pick up Maya
from school today, too.

477
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,548
I just squeezed in another
last-minute appointment and I can't do it.

478
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:07,962
Yeah, I see.

479
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,509
Come on, babe, please.

480
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:11,299
I got an appointment, too.

481
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,225
- Can't Kenny do it?
- I asked Kenny.

482
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,136
He said he was too busy,
which is really funny,

483
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,180
because I don't know
what a 15-year-old could be busy doing

484
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,350
other than drinking up all my goddamn
apple juice and dirtying up the house.

485
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,268
Oh, that's easy, they masturbate a lot.

486
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,603
<i>What? They do.</i>

487
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,355
I mean, lwas 15.

488
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,819
I was 15 this morning. Am I right, Raja?

489
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,118
Don't touch me with that hand.
Don't touch me in general.

490
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,904
Come here, let me get your beard.

491
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,698
<i>That's all? Whoa. Really?</i>

492
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,868
So you playing celebrity barber
and I'm Mr. Mom now?

493
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:40,583
You're the one who said you wanted to
spend more time with Maya and Kenny,

494
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:41,997
-so what's the problem?
- Some time.

495
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,836
Half your clients was mine to start.

496
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,170
<i>TERRY. Oh, you complaining now?</i>

497
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:48,093
When Kenny's mom asked if he can spend
the remainder of high school with us,

498
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,253
I was cool with it.

499
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,388
But since he's been with us,
he's done nothing to help out.

500
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,548
Yeah, come on.

501
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,807
It's like we have
two toddlers in the house.

502
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:55,843
- It's a new situation.
-It's not a new situation.

503
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,725
It's been a year!
You're being too soft on him!

504
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,888
You know how long he was with his mother.

505
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:00,728
<i>- I understand that.</i>
<i>- All right, y'all.</i>

506
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,858
Yo, Terri and Rashad! Yo!

507
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,898
Do y'all need a minute?
Because we'll all leave.

508
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,779
You know what? I'm gonna leave.

509
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,110
It's like Love <i>& Hip</i> Hop reunion in here.

510
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:10,365
<i>Momma Dee and Lil Scrappy.</i>

511
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,401
Terri, girl, I couldn't help but overhear.

512
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,445
I mean, girl, everybody could hear.

513
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,865
But I wanted to tell you,
and I told Rashad,

514
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,285
I could pick up Maya, like,
whenever you need me to.

515
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,253
So let me know if I can help out, girl.

516
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,793
In any... In any way.

517
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:27,253
<i>I don't need nothing
but for you to back up</i> a <i>few feet.</i>

518
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,760
This is a private discussion
between me and my husband.

519
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,136
I mean, I didn't realize
it was so private

520
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,922
'cause, like I said,
everybody can hear y'all.

521
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,174
But y'all been a little bit overwhelmed,

522
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:38,436
and let me release some of that stress.

523
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,273
Why don't you help yourself
back to your station, Draya?

524
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,900
Look, Terri. I got you.
I got you, baby. Come here.

525
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,311
My bad, girl.

526
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,024
Don't even get riled up like that, Terri.

527
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,609
- It's all good.
- Stay in your lane.

528
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,945
Come on. Baby, come here, I got you.

529
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,243
I'll go get Maya,
you do what you gotta do.

530
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:55,528
I know we need the money, so...

531
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:56,904
Thank you.

532
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,828
Well, you know, when I get home later,

533
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,785
I'll make it up to you.

534
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,294
I'll do that thing you like.

535
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,879
Yeah, okay.

536
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,005
Sure you gonna be burnt out by tonight.

537
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:11,218
It's all right, though. I'll wait for
the morning for that lazy side booty.

538
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,676
Terri, just out of curiosity,
what is that thing that you do?

539
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:19,139
Is it something that I can Google?

540
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:21,474
<i>Yo, Calvin, what's the Wi-Fi password?</i>

541
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,481
Let me get that Lupita.

542
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,562
Excellent choice.

543
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,567
You wanna act grown?

544
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,528
Well, now you got a grown-man haircut.

545
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,739
- Yeah, this gotta be some of my best work.
- Mmm-hmm.

546
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,915
- Your friends at school gonna love this.
- Oh!

547
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:44,665
That's the information
super highway right there.

548
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:46,170
Let's go.

549
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,247
So you learned your
lesson today, didn't you?

550
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:51,167
You look good, man!
Nothin' can stop you now.

551
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,844
Tell Weezy <i>I</i> said "hey!"

552
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,258
Eddie...

553
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:56,718
Tell me that ain't child abuse.

554
00:20:56,881 --> 00:20:59,851
I bet you he won't
be talking back to his mama no more.

555
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,515
Gave him the George Jefferson.

556
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,106
<i>All right, looking good.</i>

557
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:08,226
Hi. Who are you here to see?

558
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,734
Yeah, I'm here to see One-Stop.

559
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:11,444
Take a number.

560
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,648
They all here to see One-Stop.

561
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,858
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

562
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,194
Right, right.

563
00:21:19,153 --> 00:21:20,905
That's what I said.

564
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,205
Give me a minute, brother.

565
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,117
I need eight 32-inch TVs. No plasma, man.

566
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,911
Just LCDs, brother. You know what I mean?

567
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,746
<i>I got the watches, I got the rings.</i>

568
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:29,914
I'm doing tailoring,

569
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,332
I'm doing a little bit
of everything now, brother.

570
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:32,500
<i>Right, right, right, right.</i>

571
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,713
No, I just do the measurements.

572
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,878
I got a little Asian lady
who puts the suit together.

573
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,383
<i>She sews. I don't sew.</i>

574
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,468
Calvin, you reallyjust gonna
let this fool come slidin' up in here

575
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:44,269
<i>- like he run the place?</i>

576
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,555
Eddie, worry about your section.

577
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,892
<i>- Pardon me.</i>

578
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,943
Look here, Truck Stop, One-Stop.

579
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,071
Come here, son. This the barber shop.

580
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,029
You gotta get people in and out.
That's what we do.

581
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,819
You got these musty negroes
sitting around here all day,

582
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,407
like it's an unemployment office.

583
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:04,574
Hey, Eddie, man, look. I pay booth rent
like everybody else does in here.

584
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,741
Besides,

585
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:08,411
barbers don't provide the full
menu of services that I do.

586
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,625
Off-market medicinal remedies,

587
00:22:10,788 --> 00:22:12,631
alternative documentation,

588
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,758
little emotional service doggies

589
00:22:14,917 --> 00:22:16,919
that lick your face
and make you feel good about yourself.

590
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:18,759
And they tinkle all over your shirt.

591
00:22:18,921 --> 00:22:21,549
They so happy to see you.
And it makes you feel good inside.

592
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,717
I've been around a long time here, son.

593
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:26,888
And what all you do is sell fake ID,

594
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,307
nickel bags of weed,
and pit bull puppies.

595
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,646
Talking about a little puppy
gonna lick on somebody's face.

596
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,026
It sounds too freaky for me.

597
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:34,562
I don't want no puppy licking on me.

598
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,571
It's just not at all African-American.

599
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,528
Sounds very, very Caucasian.

600
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:41,327
Calvin, you really gonna
let him be up in the shop?

601
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,532
Like, I can't believe
he let you up in here.

602
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,331
Calvin, my man. You're my man, right?

603
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:49,285
Please tell this man, this ancient being,

604
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,748
this old fogey,

605
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,458
this dinosaur of some sorts.

606
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,622
Oh, keep them coming.

607
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:56,133
This negro-saurus of a man
walking around here giving us

608
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:58,886
the damn trailer to Jurassic <i>Park,</i>
every time we walk up in here.

609
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,631
Okay, that was a good one right there.

610
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,601
Please tell this
50 <i>Shades</i> of Grey-looking ass,

611
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,978
am I or am I not

612
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,435
a intricate part of this damn shop?

613
00:23:11,265 --> 00:23:12,312
He got a point, Eddie.

614
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,021
He got...

615
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,945
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

616
00:23:18,314 --> 00:23:20,533
You know what? That's it for me.

617
00:23:20,691 --> 00:23:21,988
Hey. But this ain't no free clinic.

618
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,075
I understand. And I did stop doing
the VD screenings last week.

619
00:23:25,321 --> 00:23:27,824
It's done, okay? It's over.

620
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,582
What can I do for you, brother?

621
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,327
Uh. I got a itch

622
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:32,745
down there.

623
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,121
<i>It's a itch that burns.</i>

624
00:23:34,288 --> 00:23:36,666
Come over here. This is the last one.

625
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,543
<i>This boy burning bad,
I smell it. Come on.</i>

626
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,632
- Hey, everybody!
<i>- Hey, girl.</i>

627
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,512
Rashad, I got your sheen spray for you.

628
00:23:42,755 --> 00:23:43,756
<i>Appreciate that.</i>

629
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,642
Angie, this conditioner
should last you for the next two weeks.

630
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,017
<i>Thank you, baby!</i>

631
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,812
Can you help me put
these away in the back?

632
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,519
<i>Hey, who's winning
over here, now? What's goin' on?</i>

633
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,352
By a show of hands, who got a itch?

634
00:23:56,644 --> 00:23:57,861
Who got a burn?

635
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,146
Damn.

636
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,028
<i>So, did you hear
Mr. Harris got shot?</i>

637
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,654
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

638
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,121
Are you serious? ls he okay?

639
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,954
I mean, he got shot, so he's not great.

640
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,117
But he's gonna make it.

641
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,373
Oh, no.

642
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,581
I was just in there last week
talking to his wife.

643
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:20,881
Man. She was so excited
they was getting a second location.

644
00:24:21,835 --> 00:24:22,836
Was she with him?

645
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,380
No, thank God.

646
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,765
You know, he was in there by himself
closing up for the night.

647
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,518
Wouldn't open up the register,
so they shot him.

648
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,305
I don't know what's
happening out there, Calvin.

649
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,314
These kids have lost their damn minds.

650
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:36,893
Meanwhile, we gotta
raise Jalen in this mess.

651
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,895
It's not cool.

652
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,610
We gotta revisit that conversation.

653
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,071
What conversation?

654
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:47,453
About moving the shop.

655
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,415
You know, One-Stop found some cool
locations over there on the North Side.

656
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:54,497
Does One-Stop even know what escrow means?

657
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,412
You'd be surprised what One-Stop know.

658
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,706
And have you discussed it with Angie?

659
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:02,259
You can't make a decision about the shop
without at least talking to her first.

660
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,133
I wanted to talk to you first because you
know what you're gonna tell me?

661
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,672
"Why did you talk to her first?"

662
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,261
I do not sound like that.

663
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:12,894
I don't know, Calvin.

664
00:25:13,137 --> 00:25:15,606
Uprooting the shop is a big decision.

665
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,983
You don't think I know that?

666
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:20,152
But what else we supposed to do?

667
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,778
Just sit here and wait
for somethin' to happen?

668
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,362
We gotta explore all of our options.

669
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,737
Yeah.

670
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,537
<i>MAN 1". I ain't got no money.</i>

671
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,705
<i>MAN 2". Let me talk to you.</i>

672
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,045
<i>- No, I'm good.
- Come on, baby.</i>

673
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:43,208
<i>Let's holler at you for a little bit.</i>

674
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,376
<i>WOMAN". You hollerin' right now,</i>

675
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:45,635
<i>I can hear you. I'm good.</i>

676
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,886
<i>Yo, who that?</i>

677
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,298
<i>Hey, What up, 4.0.?</i>

678
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,465
Oh, hey!

679
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:51,850
Hey, I got that tater salad for your mama!

680
00:25:52,009 --> 00:25:53,101
- Come get it!
- All right.

681
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,138
What's going on, hungry black folks?

682
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,849
Huh? Who wants some
non-profit Gangsta Grub?

683
00:25:59,016 --> 00:26:02,020
All right. Soul food to save fools' souls.

684
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:05,065
Every delicious piece of beef
helps keep a bullet off the street.

685
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,073
I know that's right because
that "Who Smoked Your Okra"

686
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,654
was poppin' on fleek last time.

687
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,909
There you go, Draya.

688
00:26:10,152 --> 00:26:11,620
Did she just say "fleek"?

689
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:13,326
<i>Don't... Don 't just make up words.</i>

690
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,787
There's a whole dictionary full of words.

691
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,496
<i>There's a library down the street.</i>

692
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:19,999
Webster's Dictionary.
Go in there and flip through it.

693
00:26:20,162 --> 00:26:22,290
You won't see "fleek" in there, nowhere.

694
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,924
Draya, don't worry about that. I got some

695
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,835
"Don't Be So Mean" greens
in there for you today, too.

696
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,002
- You gonna love it.
- Thank you, boo-boo.

697
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:31,140
They so good, they're gonna make
a Vice Lord give a GD a foot massage.

698
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,217
<i>Nigga!</i>

699
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,847
Oh!

700
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,979
You are like
the Al Sharpton of the fat back.

701
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,139
Okay. Okay.

702
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,432
When are you gonna get
your own show on VH1?

703
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,184
Who knows, man? You know, right now,

704
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,978
I'm just happy
being a pillar of the community,

705
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,191
<i>trying to do something good.</i>

706
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:49,359
I mean, so, you want us to believe
that you cooked all that food yourself?

707
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:52,244
My kitchen workforce is
made up of ex-gangbangers,

708
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:55,531
who, if they didn't have this job,
would be on the street bangin'.

709
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,991
And you donating all the profit?

710
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,704
What's so hard to believe about that?

711
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:03,338
What is it, Eddie? What is it?

712
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,999
Rashad, you might have
to shut your mouth.

713
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,259
This pie got me dancing a jig over here.

714
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,507
Mmm-hmm.
- Don't be no sucker, Eddie.

715
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:10,671
Oh!

716
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:11,839
What's that, Rashad?

717
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:14,053
I got the little peanut butter
and poverty sandwich.

718
00:27:14,258 --> 00:27:17,057
Did Terri cut the edges off the bread
like she does for the baby, too?

719
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,189
Yo, J.D., man. This is on the up and up.

720
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:22,892
-I'm proud of you, bro.
- Oh, thanks, Calvin.

721
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,401
- But the name...
- What?

722
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,812
I'm a little concerned, man.

723
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,070
The name seems like
you're promoting something.

724
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:28,734
Man, I'm just promoting food.

725
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,616
Remember the words
of Maya Angelou, man. "Words is power."

726
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,867
Maya Ange-who?

727
00:27:34,403 --> 00:27:35,996
I know who you're talking about.

728
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:38,078
That big booty bitch
we went to high school with,

729
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,833
with the lopsided titties, I remember.

730
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,960
Calvin, come on, man.
You know I'm just joking, man.

731
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,871
You know I know who Maya Angelou is.

732
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,414
"Still I rise."

733
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,254
<i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.</i>

734
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:50,295
Who is this on the cover?
It looks like Mike Tyson.

735
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,183
<i>Gonna be a double-breasted suit.</i>

736
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,806
Can't win for losing.

737
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:04,357
Well, there he goes!
Harold Washington, Junior.

738
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,235
- What up, Jimmy?
- What's up, man?

739
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,816
- You're lookin' good.
- Good to see you.

740
00:28:08,979 --> 00:28:10,105
You know, you're the only
one that comes in here

741
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,694
with a suit on that ain't goin' to court.

742
00:28:13,984 --> 00:28:17,284
Everybody ain't tryin' to wear one of
them granny sofa suits you got.

743
00:28:17,446 --> 00:28:18,743
- Guess who's back?
- Hey, Jimmy.

744
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:19,953
What up, bro?

745
00:28:20,616 --> 00:28:21,617
<i>What bring you around here?</i>

746
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,252
I know you didn't come
all the way over here to the South Side

747
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,412
just for a line up.

748
00:28:25,621 --> 00:28:27,214
Yeah. Where's your camera crew, Jimmy?

749
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:28,715
Doing a little press opp
for the mayor's office?

750
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:31,297
What, a man can't check out his old
stomping grounds on his lunch break?

751
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:32,461
- Hell, nah.
- No.

752
00:28:32,628 --> 00:28:34,301
- No.
- Hell, no.

753
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:35,972
All right, you got me.

754
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,975
I do want to talk to you all about this
council vote that's coming up next week.

755
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,135
What vote?

756
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:41,303
The one about the enclosure.

757
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,637
- Closure?
- What enclosure?

758
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:43,847
What kind of enclosure?

759
00:28:44,014 --> 00:28:45,687
The city plans to gate off 20 blocks,

760
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:47,476
with this shop essentially
right in the middle of it.

761
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:49,569
See, the idea is that
if it can control traffic,

762
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,105
you know, one way in, one way out,

763
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:52,818
<i>it'll help decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

764
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,279
So they're just gonna
build a jail around us?

765
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,536
Do you know what cuttin' off these
streets is gonna do to traffic?

766
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,321
You're right. It might increase traffic.

767
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:01,035
<i>But it might also decrease
violence in the neighborhood,</i>

768
00:29:01,198 --> 00:29:02,620
which would make
this shop more desirable.

769
00:29:02,783 --> 00:29:03,784
That ain't gonna help us.

770
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:06,499
<i>We'll just be a non-violent empty shop.</i>

771
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:10,166
Exactly. And half the businesses on
this block are barely above water.

772
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:11,424
- Exactly.
- Look, y'all.

773
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,755
I know it's not the most ideal solution.

774
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:13,919
But you gotta acknowledge

775
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:15,133
that at least we're trying
to do something.

776
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:16,672
- No.
- Yeah. No.

777
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:17,839
Hell, no.

778
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,303
<i>Look, y'all, I share the same concerns,</i>

779
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:20,683
but something's gotta be done out here.

780
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:23,182
Do you know how many people get shot on
this block, every single week?

781
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,392
DO you?

782
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,057
'Cause we out here
dodging bullets every day,

783
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,067
while you downtown talkin'
about the South Side,

784
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:32,901
look like some Middle Eastern,
war-torn country in your $1,000 suit.

785
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,820
You know damn well
them suits ain't $1,000, boyba.

786
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,951
Look, Rashad, we want the same thing, man.

787
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,784
But the council, they're all out of
ideas just like everybody else.

788
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:42,038
That's right. Put it on us.

789
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,790
<i>That's what politicians do though.</i>

790
00:29:43,949 --> 00:29:45,041
<i>You know, they don't do their job--</i>

791
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,201
All I'm doing is workin', brother.

792
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,415
<i>...but then they want us to do it.</i>

793
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:48,794
And then you say it's our fault, right?

794
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:50,547
Like, we the ones that don't wanna work.

795
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,923
- Exactly.
<i>ltold</i> you.

796
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,508
I mentioned this a long time ago.

797
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:57,387
Government ain't good for nothing
but giving you syphilis and flu shots.

798
00:29:58,422 --> 00:30:00,140
I'm almost sure that's how I got syphilis.

799
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,976
That is not how you got syphilis.

800
00:30:03,385 --> 00:30:05,854
Her name was Josephine.

801
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,307
Would you stop
tellin' everybody's business!

802
00:30:08,557 --> 00:30:11,561
That's funny.
My mom's name is Josephine.

803
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:12,769
Ah...

804
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,314
Wait. What...

805
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,489
You know, maybe
that's part of the problem. I mean...

806
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,369
Maybe we need to
stop waiting for the government

807
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:23,906
to step in and save us
and we need to start saving ourselves.

808
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,365
<i>I mean, this is America.</i>

809
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,580
Everybody has equal
opportunity to make it here.

810
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,744
Really?

811
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:29,911
- What?
- Okay.

812
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,121
- Oh, man.
- Oh...

813
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:34,041
All right. Baba ghanoush
over here lost his damn mind.

814
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:35,424
Eddie, that's bullshit.

815
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,836
You wanna know why I'm sarcastic?

816
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,219
Because every time I open my mouth

817
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,221
to say something real,
you gotta make fun of me.

818
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,849
Meanwhile, if I say you're
a watermelon-flavored fried chicken lover,

819
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:44,009
I'm a racist.

820
00:30:44,301 --> 00:30:45,302
<i>CALVIN; Hell, nah.</i>

821
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,978
You'll get your ass beat.

822
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,597
Rashad, it was hypothetical.

823
00:30:48,764 --> 00:30:50,858
There's no such thing
as watermelon-flavored fried chicken.

824
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,438
Not yet, Raja.

825
00:30:53,477 --> 00:30:55,275
That would be stereotypically delicious.

826
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:58,441
All I'm saying is, my parents
moved here from India with nothing.

827
00:30:58,732 --> 00:31:00,325
<i>They had no money, no friends.</i>

828
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:01,736
And their accents were so thick,

829
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:03,279
they couldn't even get bank accounts.

830
00:31:03,445 --> 00:31:04,446
And somehow they made it happen.

831
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:06,786
Not to dismiss your argument here, Raja,

832
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,825
because it is... It is riveting.

833
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:11,791
However, there were
some "setbacks" that black people faced

834
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,955
that really made things
stressful for a minute there.

835
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,545
Slavery being at
the very top of that list.

836
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,631
Exactly. Your ancestors were immigrants.

837
00:31:18,794 --> 00:31:19,795
Ours were imports.

838
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,304
- Big difference.
- Not really.

839
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,340
How do you think
the West Indies happened, okay?

840
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,885
They took Indians,
they took black people from Africa,

841
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,098
they put 'em in the Caribbean,

842
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,139
and 200 years later, Rihanna happened.
You're welcome.

843
00:31:31,473 --> 00:31:33,646
I don't like white people either. Okay?

844
00:31:33,809 --> 00:31:35,937
I'm just saying, maybe y'all
should stop making excuses

845
00:31:36,103 --> 00:31:37,195
and actually pick up the ball.

846
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,355
- Whoa!
-"Pick up the ball"?

847
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:39,944
- Basketball reference.
- That was racist, right there.

848
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,149
"Pick up the ball"?

849
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,317
Oh, yes.

850
00:31:42,484 --> 00:31:44,737
It got real Fox News-y in here for me.

851
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,743
Well, yeah,
we do be shootin' some hoop.

852
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,199
<i>What are you talkin'about, man?</i>

853
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:51,118
You think it's
a level playing field out here?

854
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,124
You think racism don't exist no more?

855
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:55,835
The President of
the United States of America is black.

856
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:58,500
The most powerful man
on the planet is black.

857
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,668
Just one man.

858
00:31:59,835 --> 00:32:02,964
Meanwhile, only dude I have to look up to
is the guy from Big Bang Theory.

859
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,390
He funny. He make me laugh.

860
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,928
So what does that mean for the average
black dude walking down the street?

861
00:32:09,511 --> 00:32:10,603
Does our president's blackness,

862
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:14,141
did it stop Trayvon Martin,
or Michael Brown,

863
00:32:14,808 --> 00:32:17,937
or Walter Scott, or Tamir Rice,
or Freddie Gray from being killed?

864
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,104
Hell nah.

865
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:23,985
A madman walked into a Charleston church
and killed nine innocent people.

866
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,445
<i>Did his blackness stop that?</i>

867
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:30,992
Eric Garner got killed on tape
and it still didn't matter.

868
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,210
So what are you saying, Raja?

869
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,751
I'm not sayin' that stuff isn't messed up.
Because it is.

870
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:38,130
What I'm saying is,

871
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:40,175
there's never been a better time

872
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:43,257
in this country
to be a black person than right now.

873
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,884
Unless you Bill Cosby.

874
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,047
Uh...

875
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:49,934
I'm not doin' this school work.

876
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:52,388
If she thinks I'm really about
to do this homework tonight...

877
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,272
She gave us six packets.

878
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,640
Six packets.

879
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,026
Man, she must be insane.

880
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,481
<i>Yo, there go those dudes
from this morning.</i>

881
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,920
<i>I used to cut
Barack's hair back in the day.</i>

882
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,756
Hell, I'm the one who told
him to marry Michelle.

883
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:25,679
<i>- Oh!</i>
<i>- He liked some other little girl.</i>

884
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,884
<i>He was gonna tell</i> her--

885
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,015
Thelma Carter. With the big tongue.

886
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,384
Couldn't say his name.
She used to call him "Barath."

887
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,265
Michelle, now, that's different.
She got them childbearing hips.

888
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:37,850
<i>And she can iron a shirt.</i>

889
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,940
You see them arms right there?

890
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,155
You never touched
a hair on that man's head.

891
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,990
- Not one.
- Are you serious?

892
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,776
Hold on. Okay. All right. Okay.

893
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,453
Who do you think that is?
It's him before his hair turned gray.

894
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,954
Oh, that could be anybody.

895
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:53,865
Man, you can't tell who that is, man.

896
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,501
It's Barack right there.
You can tell by the ear.

897
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,628
You cannot.

898
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:00,297
You can't see shit.

899
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,049
You're stupid.

900
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:05,214
You know what? Forget y'all.

901
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,378
<i>-- Laugh all you want to.</i>

902
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,264
Y'all betterjust leave Barack alone.
He's one of ours.

903
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,137
He used to be one of ours.

904
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,805
I mean, when was the last time you seen
Barack Obama do something for us?

905
00:34:16,221 --> 00:34:18,144
And I'm not talkin'
about for the country.

906
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:19,649
I'm talkin' about for us.

907
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,731
Eddie, even if you don't agree,

908
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,315
you still gotta honor
what she's sayin', though.

909
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,863
Thank you, Rashad.

910
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,567
- I can't take this anymore, man. I'm out.
- All right.

911
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,277
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Thank you, man.

912
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,320
And you need to read a newspaper.

913
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,410
Obama makes sure you
get all that birth control that you need.

914
00:34:34,656 --> 00:34:35,908
Excuse me?

915
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,206
And the rest of y'all,
council vote next week. Don't forget.

916
00:34:39,369 --> 00:34:42,464
<i>Look, I can't let y'all tear
the President down like that. All right.</i>

917
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,842
The man is in an impossible situation.
Know what I'm sayin'?

918
00:34:46,001 --> 00:34:47,093
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

919
00:34:47,294 --> 00:34:49,592
He's not just the president
of black America.

920
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:52,015
He's the President of
the United States of America.

921
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:55,056
And personally,
I think he's doin' a great job.

922
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:59,019
You know what? The two of them just make
me believe in the sanctity of marriage.

923
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:01,813
I hate to be
the one to say this...

924
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,903
But Barack has definitely got bitches.

925
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,529
Oh, yeah, he does.

926
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:07,860
No, he has not.

927
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:10,988
Half these hoes weren't even registered
to vote before he ran for president.

928
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,193
<i>Give me</i> a <i>break!</i>

929
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,331
Every vote... Ass. Ass, ass, ass.
That's what it is.

930
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:19,243
Oh... You know what?
I hate to agree with Dante,

931
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:21,332
'cause it's just a bad look.

932
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,043
But every president has a side chick.

933
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,589
<i>It's constitutional.</i>

934
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:29,379
You know, Thomas Jefferson
had a whole plantation of side chicks.

935
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,888
I bet you Hillary's got a side chick.

936
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,598
Probably thick, too.

937
00:35:38,011 --> 00:35:39,729
- What's up, Terri?
- What up, Quis?

938
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:47,650
Looks like you're on
the wrong side of town, nigga.

939
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,783
Boy, this whole city is mine.
These are my blocks.

940
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,411
And I don't see nobody out there
strong enough to take it from me.

941
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,570
Shit.

942
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:56,780
So what are you sayin'?

943
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:57,947
You tryin' to embarrass yourself

944
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,240
-and get blood on the floor.
- Embarrass myself?

945
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,408
No! Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait.

946
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,576
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

947
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:02,744
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

948
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:04,003
<i>Wait</i> a <i>minute!</i>

949
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,584
Listen! Wait! Listen!

950
00:36:05,747 --> 00:36:07,090
Listen a minute! No! No! Look...

951
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,420
I'll blow your head off, man.

952
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,755
<i>Look, not in here!</i>

953
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,841
Y'all wanna kill each other,
y'all take that shit outside!

954
00:36:12,045 --> 00:36:13,046
Well, let's go outside!

955
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,255
Calvin, what he doing here?

956
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:15,674
I booked him. I booked him.

957
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,763
He has a standing appointment
with me every other week.

958
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:19,269
It got messed up when he went to jail

959
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,599
and I didn't know Quis
was gonna be here today.

960
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:21,763
I'm sorry, y'all.

961
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,056
- Stupid nigga!
- Jay!Jay!Jay!

962
00:36:23,223 --> 00:36:24,566
- That's what I'm doing here!
- Jay!

963
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,725
- Jay! Look at me.
- What you gonna do?

964
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,189
Look at me, Jay!

965
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:29,066
Come back in an hour.

966
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,276
Come back in an hour.

967
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,523
Please.

968
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,691
<i>Please.</i>

969
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,359
I'll take care of your bill.

970
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:35,826
On me.

971
00:36:37,112 --> 00:36:39,740
I'll pay for everything,
I'll pay for your hair, man.

972
00:36:41,491 --> 00:36:42,959
That's cool, Calvin.

973
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,830
All right. Thank you!

974
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:48,464
- You know me, boy.
- Thank you, man!

975
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,624
You a stupid nigga.

976
00:36:49,791 --> 00:36:50,963
<i>- Come on, man.
- I'm telling you!</i>

977
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:52,298
You know what it is.

978
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,712
<i>In an hour, man. In an hour.</i>

979
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,594
I'm sorry.

980
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,222
- Thanks,Shad.
-It's all right.

981
00:37:00,385 --> 00:37:03,059
Big boy, I'm sorry about that, man.
Misunderstanding.

982
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:08,102
We usually have that schedule
worked out a little better.

983
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,937
It's all good, Calvin.

984
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,651
You know, I'm gonna have to
get that thing from you.

985
00:37:15,817 --> 00:37:16,818
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

986
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,952
The other one, too.

987
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:27,921
Oh man, I forgot about that one.

988
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,712
Damn shame.

989
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,760
<i>Can't even go to the barbershop no more</i>

990
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:37,843
<i>without some Knucklehead
bringin' a gun in here.</i>

991
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,725
Barbershop used to be a place of peace.

992
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,678
It's for my protection.

993
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,188
From what? Some clippers?

994
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,524
What the hell you
need to be bringing that in here for?

995
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:50,360
It's my constitutional right.

996
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,519
<i>“Raga, Spa“ u.</i>

997
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,990
Constitutional right!

998
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:58,364
You need to worry about why ain't nobody
ever sitting in them chairs.

999
00:37:58,526 --> 00:37:59,869
You probably shot them all.

1000
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:03,619
Yeah, this Calvin.

1001
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,575
It might be a better question for you.

1002
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:07,164
- Crazy. Crazy.
-ls he okay?

1003
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,620
Wait. Is he okay?

1004
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:10,380
<i>Man. Come on, man.
We all lived out here...</i>

1005
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:11,585
No, I'll be on my way.

1006
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,716
I'll be there.
Rashad, handle that for me.

1007
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:14,876
Yo, Cal, what's up?

1008
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,260
I got you, no worries.

1009
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,592
No! Hell, no, man! He said Rashad.

1010
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,802
No, I don't think he said Rashad.

1011
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:20,965
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

1012
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,475
Yeah. He said me, Eddie.

1013
00:38:22,634 --> 00:38:23,886
Specifically?

1014
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:25,850
He called you by name?

1015
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,567
Baby, are you okay? Did anybody hit you?

1016
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,072
<i>JALEN". No, nothing happened.</i>

1017
00:38:40,235 --> 00:38:41,703
<i>I was just standing there
and a fight broke out.</i>

1018
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,862
Oh, don't worry. We're gonna get this

1019
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,246
-all straightened out.
- Mom! I'm fine.

1020
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,748
<i>- Let me see your</i> head.
<i>- No, Mom, I'm okay.</i>

1021
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:48,414
My God. It's, like, red right here.

1022
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,661
Goodness.

1023
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:51,792
Let me see your face.

1024
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,090
<i>So, what happened?</i>

1025
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,046
Well, frankly, Mr. Palmer,

1026
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:03,012
we're concerned about the people that
Jalen's been hanging around with lately.

1027
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,596
Are you talking about Kenny?

1028
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,686
Why would you say that?

1029
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,930
'Cause that's who
he's been hanging with every day.

1030
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,649
You guys know I can't talk
about anybody else's kids.

1031
00:39:11,808 --> 00:39:13,025
But let me just say this.

1032
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,862
Jalen has shifted
over these past few weeks.

1033
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,146
His behavior is different.

1034
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:18,735
<i>His teachers have noticed it.</i>

1035
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,442
<i>His grades have started to slip.</i>

1036
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:21,905
And the fight that happened today,

1037
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,947
he was involved in that fight,
which turned out to be gang-related.

1038
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:27,616
What do you mean "involved"?
Are you trying to say Jalen's in a gang?

1039
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,625
If he's not already in a gang,

1040
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,253
he's strongly considering joining one.

1041
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,543
No, no. I'm sorry, Jalen...

1042
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:36,174
He knows better than that.
He wouldn't do that.

1043
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,300
I understand why you feel
that way, Mrs. Palmer,

1044
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,463
but there's also a reality of what
we face in our communities.

1045
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,927
So this year is absolutely
critical for him

1046
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,184
to build a foundation
to go off to college.

1047
00:39:46,342 --> 00:39:48,561
See? This is what
I've been talking about.

1048
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:50,183
I mean, with Jalen's grades,

1049
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,480
his test scores...

1050
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,399
No way in the world
we can't get him a scholarship

1051
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,939
at the private schools,
or remember Holy Cross

1052
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,103
I was telling you, that Catholic School?

1053
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:58,271
We have to talk about this.

1054
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,439
I'll talk to their coach.

1055
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:01,153
Mr. Palmer, now hold up.

1056
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,572
Hold up.
Now, that's not what I was suggesting.

1057
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:06,409
We want Jalen to be here.
The school needs him here.

1058
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:07,618
For what?

1059
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,161
Seem like y'all losing him.

1060
00:40:09,324 --> 00:40:10,826
Mr. Palmer, I understand...

1061
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,289
I'm supposed to sit here

1062
00:40:12,452 --> 00:40:15,456
and we're going to sacrifice
our only son to this system?

1063
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,836
There's gotta be something
we can do to work together on this.

1064
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:20,969
Seems like the problem
is bigger than you and me.

1065
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,964
So, why are you pointing
the finger at Kenny?

1066
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,760
No, look.
I've been skeptical about that kid.

1067
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,973
The whole reason he's living with Rashad

1068
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,355
is because he got expelled
from school for fighting.

1069
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,191
Probably some gang-related shit.

1070
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,690
I ain't trying to have
Jalen get caught up,

1071
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,729
following behind some
little wannabe thug.

1072
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,691
So, you know, maybe we just
talk to him again

1073
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,200
or we ground him or something.

1074
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:45,861
I don't know,
but don't you think sending him

1075
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,825
to Holy Cross is a little bit extreme?

1076
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:51,116
After what we just heard?
We gotta send him somewhere!

1077
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:54,002
I'm not trying to get that call
in the middle of the night

1078
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,208
saying my son is locked up or worse,

1079
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,294
because we didn't act
when we had a chance.

1080
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,168
Keep your elbow tucked.

1081
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:04,880
Catholic school?

1082
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,140
I don't know anybody in Catholic school.

1083
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:09,721
Good. Maybe it's time for you
to meet some Catholics.

1084
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:13,604
And tomorrow, I'm gonna re-introduce you
to the concept of a belt.

1085
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,395
Ain't nobody wants to see
your butt cheeks hanging out.

1086
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,900
Nobody wears no belts.

1087
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,231
They're corny.

1088
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,862
Yeah, well, so is getting shot.

1089
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,906
When are you going to do something about

1090
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:26,067
that abomination on your head
caﬂedlocks?

1091
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,577
I'm not cutting my locks.

1092
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,612
You need to do something with them.

1093
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,874
You're the son of a barber,
you can't be walking around here

1094
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,251
looking like that girl from
The Pirates <i>of</i> the Caribbean.

1095
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:37,079
They're supposed to look like that.

1096
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:38,587
No, they're not.

1097
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,840
When you going to wash them things, man?

1098
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:43,593
Walking around smelling like
Flavor Flav's wave cap.

1099
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,964
Why are you trying to take
everything I like away from me?

1100
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,349
Because I love you, that's why.

1101
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:57,599
So just because you take some
long dramatic pause

1102
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,766
before you say something,

1103
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,482
I'm supposed to just accept your words?

1104
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,071
You're so smart, Jalen.

1105
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:07,734
If you're that smart,
keep your elbow tucked.

1106
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:10,115
My elbow is tucked. My shot is water.

1107
00:42:12,447 --> 00:42:13,790
Your shot sucks.

1108
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,541
Whose shots suck?

1109
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,960
Boy, you better ask somebody.

1110
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,122
My shot is butter.

1111
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,213
{THUDS)
- Ew!

1112
00:42:31,883 --> 00:42:32,884
<i>What up, brash'?</i>

1113
00:42:34,302 --> 00:42:35,929
I got your message.

1114
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,722
Shorties is wiling, right?

1115
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,311
How are you?

1116
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:42,398
Look, I'm going to need you to
keep your son away from mine.

1117
00:42:42,852 --> 00:42:44,069
What you talking about?

1118
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,147
You know that gang fight
that happened yesterday?

1119
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,487
Kenny got Jalen involved in that shit.

1120
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,901
No, that ain't what happened.

1121
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:53,242
I talked to Kenny, he said they was
standing there and the fight broke out.

1122
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,031
And you believed him?

1123
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,701
Yeah, I believe him. He's my son.

1124
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,669
You taking Jalen's word for it.

1125
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:00,828
You damn right!

1126
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:03,339
Jalen ain't never got
expelled from school for fighting.

1127
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:05,796
Oh, is it like that?

1128
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,087
I tell you something in
confidence, man-to-man,

1129
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,426
and now you throwing that shit
back in my face?

1130
00:43:11,923 --> 00:43:14,346
I told you that's who Kenny was
when he was with his mother.

1131
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,643
He ain't that kid no more, he with me.

1132
00:43:16,803 --> 00:43:18,476
I'm happy for you.

1133
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:19,855
Nevertheless,

1134
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,893
keep your son away from mine, man,
or we gonna have a problem.

1135
00:43:25,186 --> 00:43:28,690
Bruh, we got a problem right now.

1136
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:31,113
Wow!

1137
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:35,538
Two black fathers
bonding in the hood.

1138
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,788
It's rare.

1139
00:43:36,948 --> 00:43:38,541
It's like catching a unicorn.

1140
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:41,202
You don't see it every day,
is what I'm trying to say. Right?

1141
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:44,589
You want a latte?

1142
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,298
"One-Stop's Home and Office Decoration."

1143
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,461
Ghetto office.

1144
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,676
Ghetto office,
you decorate somebody's shit.

1145
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:56,847
So the dog ate the whole condom?

1146
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,010
Yeah.

1147
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,679
Frame your face. Shit.

1148
00:44:01,973 --> 00:44:04,897
- Okay, Eddie. Come on, man.
- Oh.

1149
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,356
You know what, I've happened
to have enough of him.

1150
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,573
Lord, they shooting!
They shooting out there!

1151
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,074
Eddie, stop playing! Get down!

1152
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,486
Hell! It'll take me too long
to get back up.

1153
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:16,404
I ain't getting down there,
it ain't worth it.

1154
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,156
It's fine.

1155
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,370
This ain't Fallujah. Come on.
Everybody, stand up.

1156
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,833
<i>My God. I gotta go.</i>

1157
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:25,997
I can't take it.

1158
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,837
Baby, that's a gang out there.

1159
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,587
<i>It ain't no ice cream truck.</i>

1160
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,094
The idea is stay away from the bullet,
don't go towards them.

1161
00:44:32,253 --> 00:44:33,505
I don't think you understand, Eddie.

1162
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:34,923
My car broke down earlier today.

1163
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:38,593
I can't be caught outside with no car
and it's dark and they're shooting...

1164
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,432
- Draya, I got you.
- It's crazy <i>right</i> now!

1165
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,222
<i>I gotta get Maya anyway.
You're on the way,</i>

1166
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,435
so I got you.

1167
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,941
Are you serious, Rashad?

1168
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,271
<i>Hold on, let me get my stuff.</i>

1169
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,894
Thank you.

1170
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,276
<i>RASHAD'. All right. YOU good, Eddie?</i>

1171
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,366
Yeah, I'm good.

1172
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,777
I need to get on out of here anyway.

1173
00:44:57,612 --> 00:44:59,285
Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.

1174
00:44:59,614 --> 00:45:01,036
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1175
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:04,373
With all that ass, she ain't safe nowhere.

1176
00:45:04,911 --> 00:45:06,834
<i>The New York</i> Times
<i>broke this down recently.</i>

1177
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:09,837
Okay, let's see.

1178
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:20,309
<i>The second amendment means
we have a right to bear arms.</i>

1179
00:45:20,468 --> 00:45:23,642
<i>Should it also mean that
there is no place in our...</i>

1180
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:41,414
I cannot believe that crazy man
came in the store doing that today.

1181
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:42,949
RASHADI He was wild!

1182
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,664
No, he played us all.

1183
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:46,869
He was crazy.

1184
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,287
Crazy!

1185
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,510
All right, then.

1186
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,175
I'll catch you tomorrow.

1187
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:06,348
Are you okay, Rashad?

1188
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:08,353
Like, seriously.

1189
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,819
Like, I don't know,
lately you've been so stressed out.

1190
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,863
I'm good! I'm good.

1191
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,193
You good?

1192
00:46:15,356 --> 00:46:16,448
Draya, I'm good.

1193
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:19,615
Well, if you need anything,

1194
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:22,530
even if you just want to talk,
I'm a great listener.

1195
00:46:24,156 --> 00:46:26,705
I know you cool. I appreciate that.

1196
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,961
I might take you up on that one day.

1197
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,006
Well, what time you gotta pick up Maya?

1198
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:38,759
Maybe we can go upstairs
and we could talk now.

1199
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:40,848
Come on, Draya.

1200
00:46:41,257 --> 00:46:42,304
What?

1201
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,428
You're inviting me to your house
just to come and talk?

1202
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,143
As opposed to what?

1203
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,684
I mean, I ain't been out
the game that long, Draya.

1204
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,727
Are you serious?

1205
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:56,398
A pretty girl tries to comfort you
in your time of stress

1206
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:57,907
and whatever the hell else
you're going through,

1207
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,692
and you gonna take it there with me?

1208
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,325
Look, my bad.
I thought you was really...

1209
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,240
Come on. Just because I'm thick,
it doesn't mean I don't have a soul.

1210
00:47:06,407 --> 00:47:08,080
But the way you was talking,
it felt like you wanted to...

1211
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,243
You know what? Good night, Rashad.

1212
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:11,253
It felt like... I thought you was...

1213
00:47:12,038 --> 00:47:13,039
Good night, Rashad!

1214
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,252
<i>Draya, it felt...</i>

1215
00:47:14,415 --> 00:47:16,008
D raya! D raya!

1216
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,544
Damn!

1217
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:20,842
Damn. Oh.

1218
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:22,973
Oh, man.

1219
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,096
Ah, man.

1220
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,386
Man, she definitely wanted it.
I know she wanted it!

1221
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,851
Hell, yeah! What do you think?

1222
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:32,267
You think I ain't gonna think that?
I mean, she got the...

1223
00:47:32,433 --> 00:47:34,606
She sitting there
with it all out like, "Yo."

1224
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,442
Leaning over. I mean...

1225
00:47:36,604 --> 00:47:38,948
I ain't tripping, right?
I ain't been out the game that long.

1226
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:40,403
You know what I'm saying?

1227
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:44,742
Damn! She said,
"You wanna come inside and talk..."

1228
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:49,451
She definitely wanted it. Right? Right?

1229
00:47:50,743 --> 00:47:52,586
Baby, I just wanted you
to know that you were right!

1230
00:47:52,745 --> 00:47:54,292
You hit the nail on the head.

1231
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,048
- Babe, listen.
- You had the hammer!

1232
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,301
We gonna send his heathen ass
to Catholic school!

1233
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,461
- Babe, <i>stop it!
-I'm gonna call the Catholics.</i>

1234
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:02,130
I'm gonna call Jesus.
Somebody call some Marys.

1235
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,139
<i>- Okay...
- The Holy Cross, we coming!</i>

1236
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,141
You and your lady having problems, huh?

1237
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,974
I can help.
You know I have counseling services.

1238
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,230
I got single, I got couple, I got group.

1239
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,978
<i>If you choose groups,
the responsibilities would be</i>

1240
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,810
to bring in cookies and, or,

1241
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,853
fruit punch every third meeting.

1242
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:22,283
No, thank you, man. I'm good.
We don't need no damn session.

1243
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:24,493
Here, man. Here's the check.

1244
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:25,653
Mmm!

1245
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,322
Calvin, before I take that check,

1246
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,411
I'm going to tell you,
it's non-refundable.

1247
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,160
If I take that check,
that check goes away.

1248
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:36,001
And if you don't have that
remaining balance on Monday,

1249
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:37,164
I promise you,

1250
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,834
it is not a homing pigeon,
it does not come back.

1251
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:42,169
You know how Mike Tyson has
those birds on that roof?

1252
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:45,264
He can let those birds go.
"Go, go!" You know?

1253
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,680
Birds fly around,
birds come back on his hand.

1254
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,015
He looks at that bird.

1255
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,017
Right?

1256
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,431
That ain't gonna happen. You understand?

1257
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:54,849
I know what non-refundable means.

1258
00:48:55,015 --> 00:48:56,358
It's forfeited.

1259
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:58,190
I just wanna let you know.
'Cause you're my man.

1260
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:01,652
Damn, man. ls it One-Stop or non-stop?
Take the check.

1261
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:07,199
Certified check. Nice.

1262
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:09,534
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Calvin.

1263
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,866
I'm gonna hold off on that handshake

1264
00:49:12,032 --> 00:49:15,832
until you make that remaining
balance payment on Monday.

1265
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:18,794
Just in case you do some nigga shit.

1266
00:49:19,165 --> 00:49:20,883
Hey, don't tell nobody.

1267
00:49:21,834 --> 00:49:24,383
It's going down
this weekend, y'all!

1268
00:49:24,545 --> 00:49:25,888
Jackie, what are you talking about now?

1269
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,549
<i>JACKIE". Girl, my husband's
got me all stressed out.</i>

1270
00:49:28,716 --> 00:49:31,219
Police got him working
back-to-back double shifts.

1271
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,438
Okay. I just need
a little touch up now, Angie.

1272
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:35,730
Oh!

1273
00:49:35,890 --> 00:49:37,062
- Touch up?
- Mmm-hmm.

1274
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:41,688
No. No, baby, you got to pull them roots
all the way up like a turnip...

1275
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,364
<i>Turn it over, ball it</i>

1276
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,695
and then put it back in your head.

1277
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,652
Jackie, I mean, no shade,

1278
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,537
but, God, you should be ashamed
to walk out the house like this.

1279
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,417
Girl, how you gonna say, "No shade,"
and then shade the shit out that lady.

1280
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,327
<i>Thank you.</i>

1281
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,713
Y'all know the boy
that got shot didn't make it.

1282
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:01,007
- Oh, my God. That's terrible.
- Uh-huh.

1283
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:02,166
No.

1284
00:50:02,333 --> 00:50:03,585
Pronounced him dead this morning.

1285
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,425
<i>My husband said that
this whole thing started</i>

1286
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:07,588
because of some fight

1287
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:09,052
that happened over there
at the high school.

1288
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,644
Y'all know what happened last time
one of their leaders got killed.

1289
00:50:14,053 --> 00:50:15,054
It was a bloodbath.

1290
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:16,268
Well, the police chief's planning on

1291
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:18,728
doubling the amount of cops
on the streets this weekend.

1292
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:20,438
Man, I'm so tired of this mess!

1293
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:21,898
<i>Every time I turn around,</i>

1294
00:50:22,061 --> 00:50:23,779
somebody is killing somebody over nothing.

1295
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:24,980
<i>And what are we supposed to do?</i>

1296
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,115
Lock our doors, don't snitch.

1297
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,201
Pretend like this shit is normal?

1298
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,948
This is bullshit, this is not normal.

1299
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,613
Then we gotta do something about it.

1300
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:36,417
Shorties out here wiling
and that's our fault. That's on us.

1301
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:39,458
Look, if we get people
to come to the shop,

1302
00:50:39,620 --> 00:50:42,123
I don't care what neighborhood they from.
They from Chatham,

1303
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:45,293
<i>from Englewood, East Side,
crazy, wherever they from,</i>

1304
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,802
we just need people from the city

1305
00:50:46,961 --> 00:50:49,430
to come meet up in the shop,
and we just talk.

1306
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,882
<i>And give them a chance to speak.</i>

1307
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,425
They're gonna come up with ideas.

1308
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:54,218
I think that's a great idea, Rashad.

1309
00:50:54,802 --> 00:50:56,804
Really great idea, baby.

1310
00:50:57,680 --> 00:50:58,977
Well, I say we do it.

1311
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,437
<i>Y'all know we have to do it.</i>

1312
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:02,067
I mean, the gangs have us scared.

1313
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:03,440
They're killing everybody.

1314
00:51:03,644 --> 00:51:05,396
<i>We don't wanna walk outside anymore.</i>

1315
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:07,486
Them people downtown,
they aren't moving for us.

1316
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:10,572
I mean, if we don't do something,
no one's gonna save our community.

1317
00:51:10,776 --> 00:51:13,245
We gotta take our streets back.

1318
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,457
<i>Action, LeShawn!</i>

1319
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,126
- Stacia!
- Sony, action, <i>Stacia!</i>

1320
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,510
Stop the violence, y'all!

1321
00:51:28,669 --> 00:51:30,512
Exactly. Calvin's Shop.

1322
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:31,672
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

1323
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:33,841
- Oh, <i>come on, man!
- You watch that booty shaking!</i>

1324
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,510
- Calvin's Shop...
- Listen, guys!

1325
00:51:35,676 --> 00:51:36,723
We know you don't
care about your community,

1326
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:39,263
but you gotta care about this.

1327
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,688
<i>Please come down to Calvin's Shop tonight</i>

1328
00:51:40,848 --> 00:51:41,940
for the community summit,

1329
00:51:42,099 --> 00:51:43,692
because dreams apparently

1330
00:51:43,851 --> 00:51:45,694
are being deferred even as we speak.

1331
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,696
- Yeah!
- | think we got it.

1332
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,282
Okay.

1333
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:58,199
- Move!
- Ow.

1334
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,868
<i>Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!</i>

1335
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:02,995
<i>You can look, but do not touch.</i>

1336
00:52:03,203 --> 00:52:04,375
<i>Look back at it.</i>

1337
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,211
<i>- You like that?
-I'm good.</i>

1338
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,374
<i>We're out in the street, you know.</i>

1339
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,542
<i>This isn't the privacy
of your own bedroom.</i>

1340
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:09,843
<i>Yeah, girl!</i>

1341
00:52:18,344 --> 00:52:20,392
<i>RASHAD". We wanna
thank y'all for being here.</i>

1342
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,898
There's still seats available
if you need a seat.

1343
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:25,685
It's important that we all are here
because this is our community.

1344
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:29,067
<i>And it's up to us to change it,
so, we wanna hear y'all ideas.</i>

1345
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:31,524
I was thinking more like
a benefit concert.

1346
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,192
You know, something for the kids.

1347
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,906
<i>I think we should just call up Kanye</i>

1348
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,412
and have him come on out and perform.

1349
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,163
Yes!

1350
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,955
He ain't coming around y'all
broke negroes.

1351
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:43,251
Are you serious right now?

1352
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:45,128
<i>Look, Kanye a Kardashian now.</i>

1353
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:47,085
He wears dresses now.

1354
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:49,090
I seen him on TV, he had a skirt on.

1355
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,250
His knees were showing.

1356
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,761
All right, all right, all right. Relax!

1357
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,172
What about R. Kelly?

1358
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:56,340
What?

1359
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,350
R. Kelly? For a kids benefit?

1360
00:52:58,509 --> 00:52:59,681
Kelly love the kids.

1361
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,720
Yeah, he can teach them
how to make home movies.

1362
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,222
No, he didn't.

1363
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:05,767
All right, already! Leave him alone!

1364
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:09,528
Do you realize how much good quality
R&B we'd have missed out on,

1365
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,940
because y'all keep bringing up
that same old bull?

1366
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,358
<i>The last albums he made,</i>

1367
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,868
them albums was made out of pure stress.

1368
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:19,246
Does anybody else have any other ideas?

1369
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,788
I'd like to say something.

1370
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,875
Look, Eddie, you once said

1371
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,915
that the barbershop is
the pillar of the neighborhood.

1372
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,245
Damn right!

1373
00:53:26,412 --> 00:53:27,538
So we use that, right?

1374
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:30,128
We turn the shop into our
safe space for the weekend.

1375
00:53:30,374 --> 00:53:31,626
<i>All right?
Neutral grounds where both sides</i>

1376
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:32,964
can come together peacefully.

1377
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:34,470
- I like that.
- Yeah.

1378
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:36,801
- Turn this place into Switzerland.
- Exactly!

1379
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:38,090
Ain't no way in hell the South Side

1380
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:40,635
is ever going to resemble
any parts of Switzerland.

1381
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:42,644
I don't even know no black Swiss.

1382
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:43,895
I mean, Swizz Beatz.

1383
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,273
<i>Is he black? Or is he white?</i>

1384
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,150
You know, he is a little beige.

1385
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,310
<i>He might be Swiss. I mean...</i>

1386
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,980
He named himself to it.
So, he's Swiss. He's Swiss.

1387
00:53:53,147 --> 00:53:54,148
<i>Can we get back to it?</i>

1388
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:56,066
We could try to get
both sides to come together

1389
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:57,985
and agree to a ceasefire.

1390
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,574
<i>And then we can get the Chicago celebs</i>

1391
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,159
to tweet about it and talk about it.

1392
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,618
Get them to support.

1393
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,953
That's good, Jerrod.

1394
00:54:04,116 --> 00:54:05,163
You know what, he's right.

1395
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,919
That means that we have
to give them something to see.

1396
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,921
Yeah, maybe we could
just give away free gifts.

1397
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,252
Like a radio promotion.

1398
00:54:11,415 --> 00:54:12,416
Yes!

1399
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,085
And who's supposed to pay
for these free gifts?

1400
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:18,256
Draya is right, we need some
incentive to bring people out.

1401
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,767
I don't want to state the obvious here,
but this is a barbershop.

1402
00:54:22,134 --> 00:54:24,808
We could just do what we already do.
For free.

1403
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,313
Free cuts the whole weekend?

1404
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:28,600
You know how much money
we pull in on Saturday alone?

1405
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:31,645
Do you know how much we're gonna
lose if that enclosure happens?

1406
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,528
- Mmm-hmm.
-It's a great idea, Calvin.

1407
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,109
<i>It is. It is</i> a <i>great idea.</i>

1408
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,649
Yeah, a 48-hour ceasefire,

1409
00:54:36,857 --> 00:54:39,610
with unlimited free cuts and styling.

1410
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,871
I mean, come on,
who could turn that down?

1411
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:45,533
I propose that Gangsta Grub
be the official caterer for this.

1412
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,201
Yeah, I bet you would.

1413
00:54:47,367 --> 00:54:48,664
Hell, yeah, dude!
You know how much money

1414
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,797
I can make out on these streets
in a 48-hour...

1415
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:54,834
To donate to the Boys and Girls Club!

1416
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,217
That's R. Kelly's favorite.

1417
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,673
<i>DANTE". Listen here, Bollyhood!</i>

1418
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,505
Leave Kels alone, God damn it,

1419
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:01,594
I say, God damn it, leave Kels alone!

1420
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,850
Sorry about that, go ahead.

1421
00:55:04,176 --> 00:55:06,144
Then I think that we have a plan!

1422
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,195
Hold up, hold up.
We've got one little problem.

1423
00:55:15,896 --> 00:55:17,523
<i>Y'all know to have a ceasefire,</i>

1424
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,067
we got to get the shot callers
to call a truce.

1425
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,153
<i>Y'all know what happened the last time</i>

1426
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,413
we got Marquis and Jay up in here.

1427
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:25,827
It was damn near World War Ill.

1428
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,241
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1429
00:55:29,034 --> 00:55:31,753
But you know what?
What if we made that mix-up happen again?

1430
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:47,894
<i>This is just</i> a <i>terrible idea.</i>

1431
00:55:48,053 --> 00:55:49,430
Yeah. "Let's cause a little mix-up.

1432
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:51,348
"Let's make that mix-up happen again."

1433
00:55:51,515 --> 00:55:52,732
That was the dumbest thing you ever said.

1434
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:53,983
Do you know who these people are?

1435
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,143
<i>They are murderers.</i>

1436
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,937
<i>They don't work at the grocery store,
and if they did,</i>

1437
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,902
they would be butchers.

1438
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,111
Quiet!

1439
00:56:00,274 --> 00:56:03,073
Thank God you wore
a G-Unit bulletproof vest.

1440
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:04,828
Yeah, it worked for 50!

1441
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:08,912
No, it didn't, actually.
He got shot in the face!

1442
00:56:09,408 --> 00:56:10,625
He got shot in the face?

1443
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,704
Draya! What's up, baby girl?

1444
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:16,089
Hold up, Calvin! What's going on in here?

1445
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:17,795
Is this a set-up?

1446
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,960
- Listen to me.
- Jay! Jay!

1447
00:56:20,127 --> 00:56:21,174
No, stop!

1448
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:22,337
<i>Hold on, hold on, hold on.</i>

1449
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:24,640
Hold on!

1450
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,220
Hold on! Wait a minute!

1451
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,635
- I wish you would, boy!
- Jay!

1452
00:56:27,801 --> 00:56:30,600
Listen! Now, I've been knowing you guys
for about 20 years, man.

1453
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:31,979
My father used to cut both of your heads!

1454
00:56:32,139 --> 00:56:33,436
Come on, bruh.

1455
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,601
Out of respect for him
and the shop, man, hear us out.

1456
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:37,565
We're asking y'all for 10 minutes.

1457
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,651
<i>That's all we asking for, bruh.</i>

1458
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:45,531
Oh, I need more time, God.
I don't wanna die a virgin.

1459
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,155
Come on, Jason.

1460
00:56:47,321 --> 00:56:48,618
Come on, G. Come on, man.

1461
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,248
<i>Let's do this, man.</i>

1462
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:51,579
Have a seat.

1463
00:57:00,334 --> 00:57:01,677
We all good. Come on, big boy.

1464
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,634
Sit on down for a second. Get on.

1465
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,357
Are we good?

1466
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,237
Hey, Rev.

1467
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,902
Fifteen fish dinners for bingo night?

1468
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,787
Hell, yeah! Ha-ha!

1469
00:57:28,946 --> 00:57:30,414
I mean, praise God!

1470
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:32,870
How about some sweet potato pie?
All right.

1471
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:36,329
All right! What's cooking? Daddy's home!

1472
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:38,589
J.D., don't come up in here
with all that shit today, okay?

1473
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:39,748
We don't have time for that shit.

1474
00:57:39,915 --> 00:57:41,007
- Okay?
- Mabel.

1475
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:43,715
What did I ask you to do?
More of this. More parsley.

1476
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,720
<i>Okay? You? You better hurry it up!</i>

1477
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:47,677
Okay, I don't even know why
he got a goddamn hairnet on.

1478
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,058
He don't even have no hair.
You guys are tripping!

1479
00:57:50,217 --> 00:57:51,309
- That's good.
- Lord have mercy.

1480
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,015
More flour. Put some more.
Don't be scared.

1481
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,304
You didn't buy it!

1482
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,597
<i>It's gotta be out of here by 2:00.</i>

1483
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:56,765
You have a break yet?

1484
00:57:56,932 --> 00:57:58,275
Knead it, knead it! Knead it

1485
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:00,151
like you knead a bitch's ass. Okay?

1486
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:01,812
- Come on! Hmm?
- Mabel.

1487
00:58:01,979 --> 00:58:03,231
What happened to us
giving them a break, huh?

1488
00:58:03,397 --> 00:58:04,398
For what?

1489
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:05,903
We've got to keep the talent healthy.

1490
00:58:06,066 --> 00:58:08,865
- Negro, I'm the talent.
- Oh!

1491
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,530
You got me twisted on there,
talking about the talent.

1492
00:58:11,697 --> 00:58:13,916
You ain't doing shit out there
worth a damn...

1493
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,247
You may be the talent, but I'm the face.

1494
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,753
<i>All right?</i>

1495
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:20,747
Look, Nana...

1496
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:25,215
We don't want this gravy train
to stop flowing anytime soon.

1497
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,050
Look at that, hmm?

1498
00:58:29,006 --> 00:58:30,724
That's just from this morning.

1499
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,427
Talent! You all take five.

1500
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:34,640
Go.

1501
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,388
Talent, take six.

1502
00:58:36,847 --> 00:58:37,848
Hmm?

1503
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:42,102
<i>I know it seems like a lot.</i>

1504
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,942
But we just asking for two days.

1505
00:58:45,105 --> 00:58:46,778
Two days and no bloodshed.

1506
00:58:46,982 --> 00:58:48,154
Exactly, gentlemen.

1507
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:50,364
Not to oversell it,
but what's gonna happen is,

1508
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,619
<i>you guys go home for the weekend,</i>

1509
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,325
<i>and all your friends on Friday</i>

1510
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:55,286
will still be alive come Monday morning.

1511
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,080
It's not a bad deal.

1512
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:05,125
Oh...

1513
00:59:05,459 --> 00:59:06,631
Why'd <i>I</i> do that?

1514
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,636
Look, all we trying to say, man, is,

1515
00:59:09,588 --> 00:59:11,886
<i>we got sons, I know y'all got kids,</i>

1516
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:15,519
and we just trying to make sure
our kids get to their 18th birthday.

1517
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:17,145
And 19th and 20th.

1518
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:19,481
<i>And it gotta start somewhere, man.</i>

1519
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:23,269
And we say it starts here
this weekend for two days.

1520
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,483
<i>But we need y'all.</i>

1521
00:59:26,021 --> 00:59:27,489
<i>Y'all the shot callers.</i>

1522
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,488
We just need y'all to call some shots.

1523
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,299
I'm in.

1524
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,809
Because of you, Cal.

1525
00:59:57,886 --> 00:59:59,388
Appreciate it, man.

1526
01:00:06,061 --> 01:00:07,187
<i>L</i> 90t you.

1527
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:11,817
All right, everybody,

1528
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,618
<i>we're good to go this weekend.</i>

1529
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,495
All right, there we go.

1530
01:00:15,654 --> 01:00:17,782
- Let's get ready.
- Yes, sir.

1531
01:00:17,948 --> 01:00:20,201
Hey, thanks for taking care
of me earlier, Rashad.

1532
01:00:20,742 --> 01:00:22,665
- I really appreciate it.
- We all good.

1533
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,454
And...

1534
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,044
Thanks for giving me
a ride home the other night.

1535
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:30,051
You were a real gentleman, Shady-Shad.

1536
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,092
<i>TERRY. So you took the bitch home.</i>

1537
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,686
Look, she needed a ride home
so I gave her a ride home.

1538
01:00:39,845 --> 01:00:40,937
I'm a good dude.

1539
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:43,607
It was nighttime, she was by herself.
I wasn't gonna leave her out there.

1540
01:00:43,849 --> 01:00:45,476
It's crazy out there.
What else was I supposed to do?

1541
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:47,064
Draya works in a barbershop.

1542
01:00:47,227 --> 01:00:49,446
There were plenty of other good dudes
who could've taken her home.

1543
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:50,730
Why'd you have to be the one?

1544
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,023
Because it was on the way.

1545
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,191
Bullshit!

1546
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,652
I know girls like Draya.

1547
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:57,241
I see through her fake lashes,
and her watermelon ass,

1548
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:59,247
and her whole damsel-in-distress routine.

1549
01:00:59,406 --> 01:01:00,828
She wants you, Rashad.

1550
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:03,164
Are you dumb enough
to fall into that girl's trap?

1551
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,373
Terri...

1552
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,251
You come home every other night

1553
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:08,673
from some video shoot
or some athlete's commercial.

1554
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,212
Do I ever question it?

1555
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:12,382
No, because I trust you.

1556
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:14,717
I know you hold me down,
I'm holding you down.

1557
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,844
I don't care, I don't like that bitch.

1558
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,138
Look, I promise you...

1559
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:21,975
I promise you, there's nothing
going on with me and Draya.

1560
01:01:22,179 --> 01:01:23,726
I need you to know that, okay?

1561
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,727
- Pull your pants down.
- What?

1562
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:28,940
Pull your pants down, we're doing it.

1563
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:30,274
What the hell are you doing, girl?

1564
01:01:30,437 --> 01:01:32,110
Stepping up my lazy side booty game.

1565
01:01:32,272 --> 01:01:33,273
- Let's go.
- Yo, chill out.

1566
01:01:33,440 --> 01:01:34,532
- Be quiet.
- I am being quiet.

1567
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,692
You're gonna wake her up.

1568
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:37,236
I don't care, we can be quiet. Let's go.

1569
01:01:37,444 --> 01:01:38,570
Chill out! Chill out! Look...

1570
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:41,240
We ain't having sex on demand,
I ain't no piece of meat.

1571
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:42,908
-"Let's go." Look...
- Whatever.

1572
01:01:43,950 --> 01:01:45,293
Get up in it.

1573
01:01:47,454 --> 01:01:49,127
Get up in it. Now!

1574
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:51,792
Imean...

1575
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:54,131
lam aroused though, I ain't gonna lie.

1576
01:01:54,628 --> 01:01:56,972
But I got this sofrito sauce
on the stove, I'll be back.

1577
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,724
What? You're just proving my point!

1578
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:02,306
And your sofrito sauce
don't taste better than me!

1579
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:07,645
You're not going nowhere.

1580
01:02:08,308 --> 01:02:09,935
Not this weekend.

1581
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,733
It's too crazy out there on them streets.

1582
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,648
But, Dad, there's a three-on-three
tournament this weekend!

1583
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,657
I don't care about no basketball.

1584
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:20,161
Do you know your mama found
gang paraphernalia in your drawer?

1585
01:02:20,904 --> 01:02:22,497
In my house!

1586
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:24,124
Now how am I supposed to trust you?

1587
01:02:24,282 --> 01:02:25,829
Man, this ain't fair!

1588
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,290
None of my team has gotta deal
with these stupid rules!

1589
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,126
You know why? Do you know why?

1590
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,835
Because most of those knuckleheads

1591
01:02:31,998 --> 01:02:33,796
ain't even got a father
to look out for them anyway.

1592
01:02:33,959 --> 01:02:35,302
But they look out for me.

1593
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,134
When I'm at school,
my boys are the ones that got my back.

1594
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,424
Who you talking about?
You talking about Kenny?

1595
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,263
You think that's your boy?

1596
01:02:42,926 --> 01:02:44,644
Why you always gotta say
something about Kenny?

1597
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,017
Aren't you and Uncle Shad like brothers?

1598
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,807
- Why you always tripping?
- Hey!

1599
01:02:48,974 --> 01:02:50,271
You watch your mouth, Jalen!

1600
01:02:50,684 --> 01:02:52,857
Now, I'm not one of your friends, okay?

1601
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:56,190
I don't see why you don't understand
how dangerous it is out there

1602
01:02:56,356 --> 01:02:59,200
and that we don't approve of
who you're associating with!

1603
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:01,703
What? You want me to hang out
with the cornball that cleans the shop?

1604
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:02,953
What's wrong with Anthony?

1605
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:05,036
Why is it corny to be smart?

1606
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:07,326
Why is it corny to do what you're asked?

1607
01:03:07,701 --> 01:03:10,045
Why is it corny to handle your business?

1608
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:13,002
That's not corny, son.
That's being a man.

1609
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:20,009
Look, <i>J...</i> I know you're mad.

1610
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:21,388
I know you're upset.

1611
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,050
But listen,

1612
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:26,220
you gotta realize how lucky you are
to have two parents

1613
01:03:26,386 --> 01:03:28,184
that wanna know where you are,
what you're doing,

1614
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,019
who you're associating with.

1615
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,228
That's important.

1616
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:32,893
You're lucky.

1617
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,737
I don't feel lucky.

1618
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,032
My life would be so much
better if you wasn't in it.

1619
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,407
What? What'd you say? Jalen!

1620
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:42,069
- Did you hear him?
- Baby, please wait! Hey!

1621
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,327
Hey, boy!

1622
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,578
Did you hear what he said?

1623
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:45,910
I know, but listen, he didn't mean it!

1624
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:48,245
He's angry and he's 14.

1625
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:50,410
Well, I'm angry and I'm older than 14.

1626
01:03:50,577 --> 01:03:52,329
- Boy, you ain't white!
- Okay, babe...

1627
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,918
Listen, at some point, he's gonna realize

1628
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,924
that we're doing all of this
because we love him.

1629
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:58,926
- But he's not a tough guy.
- I know.

1630
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,588
He's trying to act like it.
Boy, you not a tough guy!

1631
01:04:01,755 --> 01:04:03,223
Hey, I know that.

1632
01:04:03,673 --> 01:04:05,926
South Side's no place to flex.

1633
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:10,105
You ain't got it like that,
you need to ease back

1634
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,607
'cause the consequences
out here are way too thin.

1635
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,565
I know, but clearly,
he's going through something.

1636
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:19,106
But you and me? We raised a smart kid.

1637
01:04:19,773 --> 01:04:21,275
He's gonna turn around.

1638
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,567
Trust me.

1639
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:25,946
Hope so.

1640
01:04:28,615 --> 01:04:31,118
<i>Unlike New York and LA,
there has been a spike</i>

1641
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:35,588
<i>in the number of homicides
in Chicago in the last year.</i>

1642
01:04:35,747 --> 01:04:38,216
You think anybody who's not
a regular will show up?

1643
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:40,469
Yeah, everyone likes free shit.

1644
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:43,756
That's not exactly what
we're doing this for though.

1645
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,469
You really think
the neighborhood's gonna agree

1646
01:04:45,632 --> 01:04:47,384
to be peaceful for two days?

1647
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,769
I can't think of the last time
we went two hours

1648
01:04:49,928 --> 01:04:51,976
without gunfire popping off around here.

1649
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,140
We gonna make it happen this weekend.

1650
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,934
So what? What happens after that?

1651
01:04:56,101 --> 01:04:57,819
The enclosure just magically stops?

1652
01:04:57,977 --> 01:05:01,652
Exactly. It ain't like politicians
really listen to the people anyway.

1653
01:05:01,815 --> 01:05:02,987
<i>So we're gonna make them listen.</i>

1654
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,119
The shop staying open
depends on the success of this ceasefire

1655
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,403
and how much press we get.

1656
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,322
Check this out.
I already created a Twitter campaign.

1657
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:11,416
#BarbershopSavesTheNeighborhood.

1658
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,952
Now, look, we get a few
celebrities to tweet that out,

1659
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:15,166
we'll go viral in no time.

1660
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:16,329
RAJAI I'll tell you what.

1661
01:05:16,496 --> 01:05:19,124
If you can get this to be
a trending topic on Twitter,

1662
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:20,462
I'll vote Democrat the next election.

1663
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:21,626
Deal.

1664
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,670
This just got very interesting.

1665
01:05:24,087 --> 01:05:25,464
- What up, everybody?
- Yo-yo.

1666
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:27,428
- Am I early or late?
- Both.

1667
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,682
My man.

1668
01:05:32,178 --> 01:05:33,646
Come on.

1669
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,354
I don't think we should.
What do you think?

1670
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,436
Made him get in the game injured, man.

1671
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,525
That's why we
couldn't do nothing last week.

1672
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:43,861
Head must tilt a certain way.

1673
01:05:44,107 --> 01:05:45,199
I'm just fond of shit.

1674
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,860
Uh, I like that.

1675
01:05:47,026 --> 01:05:48,903
<i>MAN". I'll set that down there.</i>

1676
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,071
<i>Thank you! Appreciate it.</i>

1677
01:05:50,238 --> 01:05:52,366
<i>MAN". Thank you for the work.
Appreciate it.</i>

1678
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,005
This is low as I can go really.

1679
01:06:07,172 --> 01:06:09,140
I can't go much lower than this now.

1680
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,517
- Is this decaf?
- Uh, yeah, cold brew's for me.

1681
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:12,723
Good looking out, A.

1682
01:06:12,886 --> 01:06:14,308
Yeah, no problem.

1683
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:17,353
All right, my man. Thanks for coming.

1684
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:18,641
- Yo, who next?
- I got you, Cal.

1685
01:06:27,066 --> 01:06:28,409
There you go.

1686
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:30,571
<i>How is it out there?</i>

1687
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,031
Streets is quiet, feels good.

1688
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,040
It's actually starting to feel
a little normal.

1689
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,577
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

1690
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:37,957
All right, ma.

1691
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,211
Bye, Anthony-Shmanthony.

1692
01:06:43,416 --> 01:06:44,508
Girl, I know.

1693
01:06:46,294 --> 01:06:47,841
That was probably crazy.

1694
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,677
<i>Bitch, we've been in here 17 hours.</i>

1695
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,386
<i>You know, I am half delirious.</i>

1696
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:52,550
Mmm-hmm.

1697
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,934
So what'd he say?

1698
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:56,429
Angie, do you wanna get that?

1699
01:06:59,265 --> 01:07:00,608
<i>- Stop, Tewana, stop!</i>
- What <i>the</i> fuck?

1700
01:07:00,767 --> 01:07:02,019
I'm the owner today?

1701
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:05,946
Calvin's shop, Bree speaking.

1702
01:07:06,105 --> 01:07:07,357
<i>ONE-STOP". May I speak to Calvin, please?</i>

1703
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,276
Yeah, one second. Calvin, it's for you.

1704
01:07:09,442 --> 01:07:10,443
Who is it?

1705
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,617
I'm sorry, may I ask who's calling?

1706
01:07:12,779 --> 01:07:14,452
<i>- It's me, girl!
-Oh.</i>

1707
01:07:14,614 --> 01:07:17,117
Why you acting all business like?
It's One-Stop.

1708
01:07:19,452 --> 01:07:20,954
I'll answer it in the back.

1709
01:07:22,497 --> 01:07:23,623
Yeah, he's gonna take it in the back.

1710
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:24,791
<i>Oh, it's like that?</i>

1711
01:07:24,958 --> 01:07:26,005
That's gross.

1712
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,634
Yo, Raja, let me get
some of that spray, G.

1713
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:35,473
I had to get mine in the back,
like everybody else,

1714
01:07:35,635 --> 01:07:37,558
so what makes you so special, "G"?

1715
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:39,438
<i>- You</i> a <i>vic, man.
- Say that to my face.</i>

1716
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,224
<i>Come on back and say it to my...
Don't! No, don't.</i>

1717
01:07:41,391 --> 01:07:42,768
No, no, stop being mean, Rashad.

1718
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:44,151
<i>Stop!</i>

1719
01:07:44,644 --> 01:07:46,146
Oh, shit!

1720
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,314
- Shit! That's dope!
- Yeah!

1721
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,529
- Yo, you...
- You hooked it up!

1722
01:07:50,692 --> 01:07:53,070
One-Stop, why didn't you just
call me on my phone?

1723
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:55,659
<i>ONE-STOP". B, your cell number's
in my old phone. I got a new Galaxy.</i>

1724
01:07:55,822 --> 01:07:57,824
It isn't even out yet, man.
It's not even on the market.

1725
01:07:57,991 --> 01:07:59,083
People don't have it yet.

1726
01:07:59,242 --> 01:08:00,334
<i>Has everything on this bad boy...</i>

1727
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:02,495
Satellite radio, holographic video,

1728
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:04,835
surround sound, 5G.

1729
01:08:04,998 --> 01:08:06,341
<i>Man, this phone is the only phone</i>

1730
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:07,921
<i>that's, like, five minutes
ahead of every call.</i>

1731
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:09,506
So, I already talked to your ass already!

1732
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,671
- Dude, shut up!
<i>- It's</i> crazy!

1733
01:08:11,838 --> 01:08:13,010
Damn. Now what's going on?

1734
01:08:13,172 --> 01:08:15,140
Look, I got a Italian couple
here that's hot on this place.

1735
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,301
<i>- They love it!</i>
- Who?

1736
01:08:16,467 --> 01:08:18,185
They wanna open a yogurt spot
or a yoga spot.

1737
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:20,142
What's the issue? What'd you call me for?

1738
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:21,306
Are we good or not?

1739
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:22,769
<i>Because if you're
thinking about backing out...</i>

1740
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,184
I'm not thinking about backing out.

1741
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,193
Now, I told you,
me and my wife, we want that shop.

1742
01:08:26,686 --> 01:08:29,485
All right, man. Oui, oui.
I'll see you Monday.

1743
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,194
And that's French.

1744
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:33,822
Dumbass.

1745
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:40,829
Hey, what's up?

1746
01:08:41,492 --> 01:08:42,539
What's up?

1747
01:08:43,161 --> 01:08:44,162
You good?

1748
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:46,540
I'm straight.

1749
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,560
We rolling out
with the rest of the family

1750
01:08:59,719 --> 01:09:01,016
from Holy City tomorrow.

1751
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:03,560
Y'all still down, right?

1752
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:05,225
<i>- Hell,</i> yeah.
- Yeah, probably.

1753
01:09:11,648 --> 01:09:12,900
This nigga said probably?

1754
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,734
No, we down for sure.

1755
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:20,998
Y'all little niggas better be.

1756
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:23,580
Because if you in this,
you in this for life.

1757
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:26,712
But you know that, though, right, Kenny?

1758
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:29,253
Yeah, I know what's up.

1759
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,593
Yeah, all right.

1760
01:09:33,419 --> 01:09:34,591
We gonna see.

1761
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,759
I'm gonna give you the shake
tomorrow, too, youngster.

1762
01:09:40,218 --> 01:09:41,435
That's right.

1763
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:50,853
I'm not stalking you,

1764
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,489
I'm just getting something for my clients.

1765
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:56,241
Uh, Draya, I want to
talk to you anyway, 'cause...

1766
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:58,403
You know what? The other night...

1767
01:09:58,569 --> 01:09:59,946
That was my fault.

1768
01:10:00,238 --> 01:10:01,455
I was tripping-

1769
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:04,125
And I hope we good.

1770
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,371
I forgive you, Rashad.

1771
01:10:11,791 --> 01:10:13,793
Hey, who wants some chicken wings?

1772
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,463
And I got some homemade banana pudding
from BJ's Market.

1773
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:17,755
Nice!

1774
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:20,888
Is this gluten-free, Terri?

1775
01:10:24,137 --> 01:10:25,263
Hey, what you doing now?

1776
01:10:25,430 --> 01:10:27,979
You're saying no,
but that's not what you mean, Rashad.

1777
01:10:28,141 --> 01:10:29,563
That is what I mean.

1778
01:10:29,726 --> 01:10:30,818
I knew I wasn't tripping the other night.

1779
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,320
- No, you weren't.
- You tripping right now.

1780
01:10:32,478 --> 01:10:33,479
Rashad!

1781
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,151
Shad, you back here?

1782
01:10:40,486 --> 01:10:41,578
Shad!

1783
01:10:44,407 --> 01:10:45,499
<i>Babe.</i>

1784
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:47,585
Shad, you back here?

1785
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,166
- You be quiet.
- You be quiet!

1786
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:50,329
No,no!

1787
01:10:51,330 --> 01:10:52,798
Where you at?

1788
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,259
Oh, man.

1789
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:56,965
Babe, you in the bathroom?

1790
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,361
Hi, Terri.

1791
01:11:23,029 --> 01:11:24,872
No, baby. I'm tellin' you, we did nothing.

1792
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:26,283
- Get off me!
- There was nothing happening!

1793
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:27,496
<i>TERRY. Don't touch me!</i>

1794
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:28,875
- I need you to listen to me!
- Do not touch me!

1795
01:11:29,035 --> 01:11:31,538
I'm listening, I'll listen!
I'll listen! I'm listening.

1796
01:11:31,704 --> 01:11:33,377
- It ain't what you think...
- Okay, all right!

1797
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,550
Hey, what's going on?

1798
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,298
<i>Draya, stop!
Calvin, help me on this!</i>

1799
01:11:38,461 --> 01:11:39,804
Get off me!

1800
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:42,765
- Wait a minute!
- Let me get at her!

1801
01:11:42,924 --> 01:11:44,016
Get off me!

1802
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,347
- Baby!
- Rashad, get off me!

1803
01:11:45,510 --> 01:11:46,557
<i>Baby, you gotta chill.
Nothing happened.</i>

1804
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:47,891
Calvin, help me!

1805
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:49,226
World Star fight!

1806
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:50,560
No, no World Star.

1807
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:51,815
I need you
to listen to me for a second.

1808
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,021
Leave me alone!

1809
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:55,482
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1810
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:59,194
Calm down. I need you to calm down.

1811
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:07,198
You ain't even worth it.

1812
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,922
Go get her.

1813
01:12:22,588 --> 01:12:23,589
EDDIE; <i>Cal,</i>

1814
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:26,430
<i>do we still have those cameras
in the back?</i>

1815
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:28,344
I told you not to take those down.

1816
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:30,764
We could've had the shop's first sex tape.

1817
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,519
<i>- Whatever!
- Terri. Terri, come on.</i>

1818
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:33,683
- I know what I saw.
- Come on, Terri.

1819
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,851
- Hey, Terri, come on.
- I know what I saw.

1820
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,439
- I need you to talk to me.
- I knew it!

1821
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,728
- Whatever! I knew it.
- You have to listen to me.

1822
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:40,739
I knew it. I should've never trusted you
or that skank-ass ho!

1823
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,947
Look, why would I mess around with Draya
in the same shop you work at?

1824
01:12:44,110 --> 01:12:45,202
-I'm smarter than that!
- Whatever!

1825
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,408
I don't care what happened!

1826
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:47,914
You should've never let it get that far.

1827
01:12:48,072 --> 01:12:49,619
You made her think she could!

1828
01:12:49,782 --> 01:12:51,409
Why do you even talk to her anyway?

1829
01:12:51,742 --> 01:12:52,743
I don't know!

1830
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:54,958
It's because... Look, she talked to me.

1831
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,623
You don't be talking to me, I talk!

1832
01:12:56,789 --> 01:12:58,791
She asked me how I'm doing,
she asked what's going on!

1833
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:00,551
- Where you at?
- Where I'm at!

1834
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:02,462
I'm working, for us, for our family!

1835
01:13:02,628 --> 01:13:04,881
This ain't about work,
I'm talking about us.

1836
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,094
Me and you.

1837
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:08,476
I'm talking about me and you for real.
Look at me.

1838
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,642
Baby, look, look.

1839
01:13:13,431 --> 01:13:15,308
I tell you, you look beautiful every day.

1840
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:17,477
I say that because I mean it,

1841
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:19,566
and I want you to know that I see it,

1842
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:21,481
because I love you, I care about you.

1843
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,983
You sound like a real bitch right now.

1844
01:13:24,650 --> 01:13:27,324
Look, I ain't gonna be too many bitches.

1845
01:13:27,904 --> 01:13:28,905
Straight up.

1846
01:13:30,156 --> 01:13:31,829
Now, if you wanna have
a real conversation,

1847
01:13:31,991 --> 01:13:33,584
we have a real conversation.

1848
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,835
But you ain't gonna never
call me a bitch again.

1849
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:42,676
I don't have nothing else to say to you.

1850
01:13:46,255 --> 01:13:47,427
I'm out.

1851
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:52,307
Go on then.

1852
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,266
Damn.

1853
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,276
For all that, I should have smashed.

1854
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,696
<i>Good afternoon, everybody!</i>

1855
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,528
<i>Folks coming home from church
are getting ready</i>

1856
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,196
<i>for their Sunday dinner. Mmm!</i>

1857
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,990
<i>It's a lazy quiet day...</i>

1858
01:14:12,156 --> 01:14:13,157
<i>It's your girl, Terri.</i> Leave <i>it.</i>

1859
01:14:13,324 --> 01:14:14,371
<i>RJ". ...and that's a good thing for once.</i>

1860
01:14:14,533 --> 01:14:16,786
<i>Stay with us, I got some of your requests

1861
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,296
<i>All right, I'm good. Thank you!</i>

1862
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,644
You got something you wanna say?

1863
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,396
You know what,
women like you are the reason

1864
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,522
why women like me
can't find a decent man.

1865
01:14:37,682 --> 01:14:38,683
Excuse me?

1866
01:14:38,891 --> 01:14:39,938
Bree, this is not the time...

1867
01:14:40,101 --> 01:14:41,398
Don't be mad at me because you can't

1868
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,233
-get a man or keep a man!
- Draya...

1869
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,569
With all the single dudes in the world,
you just gotta be a married man's ho?

1870
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:46,732
Is that your thing? ls that what you do?

1871
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:47,900
Yo, you better get your girl.

1872
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:49,068
You just break up a healthy relationship?

1873
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:50,236
You gotta get your girl.

1874
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:51,620
- You better get her now!
- Ladies! Ladies, listen.

1875
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:53,531
- I'm dead serious.
- Don't nobody wanna hear all that!

1876
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:56,709
Now, if y'all wanna fight, fuss and cuss,
you take it to the back.

1877
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,414
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Cal, this is not <i>Fight</i> Club.

1878
01:14:58,703 --> 01:15:00,376
You can't send ladies
to the back room to fight.

1879
01:15:00,538 --> 01:15:03,087
You gotta sign a waiver
and a release of liability.

1880
01:15:03,249 --> 01:15:05,217
If they start fighting in that
back room and tear shit up,

1881
01:15:05,376 --> 01:15:06,423
<i>I'm telling you, man,</i>

1882
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:08,713
<i>it's gonna come back on your insurance.
That's a deductible.</i>

1883
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,597
And I do dental work, too,
if it gets out of hand.

1884
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:11,841
<i>Okay, come see me.</i>

1885
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,100
Man, shut up, One-Stop.

1886
01:15:13,384 --> 01:15:15,557
Look, I don't wanna take sides here,

1887
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,768
but does anybody else here
see the hypocrisy

1888
01:15:17,930 --> 01:15:20,774
in always blaming
the single woman for the affair?

1889
01:15:20,933 --> 01:15:23,231
<i>I mean, let's be honest,
she wasn't the one</i>

1890
01:15:23,394 --> 01:15:25,943
who swore to be honest and to be faithful

1891
01:15:26,105 --> 01:15:29,109
<i>and not cheat in the back room
of the barbershop</i>

1892
01:15:29,275 --> 01:15:31,118
until I'm dead. It was him.

1893
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:33,951
How many times I gotta say
ain't nothing happened?

1894
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,410
Yeah, nothing happened.

1895
01:15:35,573 --> 01:15:37,075
But I'm not gonna spend every day

1896
01:15:37,241 --> 01:15:40,871
explaining myself to you, you, or you!

1897
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,624
Look, I'm just saying,
hypothetically, okay?

1898
01:15:44,790 --> 01:15:47,714
It is shameful society always
blames the other woman

1899
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:49,299
when they should be blaming him.

1900
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:50,634
<i>Listen, doofus...</i>

1901
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:53,049
Monogamy doesn't run in our DNA.

1902
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,808
- You understand that?
- What?

1903
01:15:54,967 --> 01:15:56,093
You can't defy science.

1904
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:57,887
That is ridiculous, that is bullshit.

1905
01:15:58,054 --> 01:15:59,556
<i>Women want sex, too.</i>

1906
01:15:59,722 --> 01:16:03,317
And you don't see us lying and cheating,
and going out buying sports cars.

1907
01:16:03,476 --> 01:16:05,319
You're just a weak-ass man, Dante.

1908
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:06,821
Honestly, it's as simple as that.

1909
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,151
Yeah, okay and I'll be that.

1910
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:11,818
A weak-ass man with a sports car
and a gaggle of bitches.

1911
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,445
In real life.

1912
01:16:13,652 --> 01:16:15,529
Ew, y'all ain't shit, man.

1913
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:17,323
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, now, wait a minute.

1914
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:19,333
Don't lump us all in there.

1915
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,290
You know,
men aren'tjust looking to cheat.

1916
01:16:21,452 --> 01:16:24,456
That's like saying every woman
wants a big package.

1917
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:25,999
<i>Because it's just not true.</i>

1918
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,338
They do, they all want a big package.

1919
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:30,174
<i>I</i> know <i>I</i> do.

1920
01:16:30,336 --> 01:16:31,804
Honestly, I thought
that it was more about

1921
01:16:31,962 --> 01:16:34,340
passion and love, and, like,
how you guys connected...

1922
01:16:34,673 --> 01:16:35,765
<i>I mean, I have...</i>

1923
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:37,677
I believe he's gay.

1924
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:39,686
Like that? Like that?

1925
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:41,351
I'm a real man.

1926
01:16:41,514 --> 01:16:42,857
I don't feel like I need to cheat.

1927
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,232
Now that's just a lie.

1928
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:46,356
<i>Because if Halle Berry came
walking in right now</i>

1929
01:16:46,519 --> 01:16:49,022
and offered you them drawers,
you trying to tell me you wouldn't

1930
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:50,690
take her in the back
and just bed her down?

1931
01:16:50,856 --> 01:16:53,200
Hell, no. Halle Berry crazy as hell.

1932
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,861
<i>From Monster's Ball?</i>

1933
01:16:55,945 --> 01:16:59,199
"I want you to just make me feel good."

1934
01:16:59,365 --> 01:17:00,491
No.

1935
01:17:00,783 --> 01:17:02,160
You crazier than she is.

1936
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,377
I like them crazy.

1937
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:06,210
Like one-eye open crazy.

1938
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:08,340
Like gotta hide your wallet crazy.

1939
01:17:08,499 --> 01:17:09,671
Solange crazy.

1940
01:17:09,834 --> 01:17:11,507
Kick me, bitch, in the elevator.

1941
01:17:11,669 --> 01:17:13,216
- Man, that's...
- Shut up!

1942
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,433
I can't wait to give her this D.

1943
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,935
Ooh. He crazy there. This one.

1944
01:17:24,098 --> 01:17:25,190
Now that's dangerous.

1945
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:26,896
<i>Well, look, maybe it's just me.</i>

1946
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:28,436
I'm a romantic.

1947
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:29,854
One woman is good enough for me.

1948
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:32,648
<i>Yeah, what's going on, everybody?
I wanna send a special shout-out</i>

<i>- Did</i> you hear <i>that?</i>

a trending topic on Twitter, okay?

1957
01:17:47,746 --> 01:17:49,089
Don't matter.

1958
01:17:49,248 --> 01:17:51,250

1960

Look, I feel terrible about
what happened to Anthony.

2016
01:21:21,251 --> 01:21:22,298
We all do.

2017
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:24,634
That's the reason that
we have to keep going

2018
01:21:24,797 --> 01:21:25,969
now more than ever.

2019
01:21:27,424 --> 01:21:28,892
How can you give up like this?

2020
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:30,303
Because that's what he do.

2021
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:33,056
He already had planned to

2022
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:35,145
open up a shop on the North Side.

2023
01:21:35,307 --> 01:21:36,604
That's what he put money down on.

2024
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,192
Is that right, Cal?

2025
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,570
<i>You already plan to leave us behind.</i>

2026
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:46,489
Calvin.

2027
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,410
Calvin, is that true?

2028
01:21:53,283 --> 01:21:54,876
Look.

2029
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:56,419
I'm a father first.

2030
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:57,579
Oh, my God.

2031
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:59,665
Y'all gotta realize that. Okay?

2032
01:21:59,832 --> 01:22:00,958
I got a son, too, man.

2033
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,173
Okay, you take care of yours,
I take care of mine.

2034
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,838
Now y'all depend on me
to do a few things,

2035
01:22:06,004 --> 01:22:08,098
but Jalen depends on me to do everything.

2036
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,180
And I'm not about to leave him out here

2037
01:22:10,342 --> 01:22:12,344
in these streets
to get hurt for you, you,

2038
01:22:12,511 --> 01:22:13,637
or this damn shop!

2039
01:22:13,804 --> 01:22:16,273
None of us have ever asked you
not to be a father!

2040
01:22:16,432 --> 01:22:17,934
None of us!

2041
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:21,354
We are here because of fathers
like you and sons like Jalen,

2042
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,022
and you didn't even tell us?

2043
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:26,943
We get up every single day
and we work beside you!

2044
01:22:27,860 --> 01:22:29,487
We're supposed to be your friends!

2045
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:32,873
I am your partner!

2046
01:22:33,031 --> 01:22:34,499
<i>When were you gonna tell me?</i>

2047
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:36,035
I was gonna say something
after the ceasefire.

2048
01:22:36,201 --> 01:22:38,124
- Man, that's bullshit.
- No, that's some real shit.

2049
01:22:38,287 --> 01:22:39,288
<i>You weren't gonna tell us</i>

2050
01:22:39,455 --> 01:22:40,502
'cause you ain't care
about what we think.

2051
01:22:40,664 --> 01:22:42,507
- What?
- You sold us out, man.

2052
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:45,089
I didn't sell nobody out, man.
I've been here for years!

2053
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:47,880
Y'all are the only reason
I come to this damn shop!

2054
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:50,299
I've been wanting
to leave here years ago!

2055
01:22:50,799 --> 01:22:52,551
<i>I'm just trying to do better, man.</i>

2056
01:22:52,718 --> 01:22:55,062
That's it! For my family!

2057
01:22:55,220 --> 01:22:56,972
If you can't understand that, I'm sorry.

2058
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:59,233
-I'm sorry, but I'm out!
- Wait, Calvin. Come on.

2059
01:22:59,391 --> 01:23:00,643
- Let's talk...
- No. I'm gone. I'm out!

2060
01:23:00,809 --> 01:23:02,903
Calvin! Calvin?

2061
01:23:14,948 --> 01:23:16,916
Thanks. Appreciate it.

2062
01:23:32,341 --> 01:23:33,843
What do you say, Eugene?

2063
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,727
<i>EUGENE". Hey, hey, what's up, Big Eddie?</i>

2064
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,559
Why don't you give me
a double shot of Hennessy?

2065
01:23:37,721 --> 01:23:39,769
- You got it, boss.
- Yep.

2066
01:23:40,766 --> 01:23:42,894
You got some of those wasabi nuts?

2067
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:50,193
Eddie, if you came in here
on some OI' Man <i>River</i> shit,

2068
01:23:50,359 --> 01:23:51,952
trying to tell me what kind of fool I am

2069
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,453
for moving the shop,

2070
01:23:53,612 --> 01:23:54,738
I don't want to hear it.

2071
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:58,287
Well, I might as well just
take my drink to go then.

2072
01:23:58,450 --> 01:24:00,919
Go on. Put that in a plastic cup.

2073
01:24:02,955 --> 01:24:05,083
I'm gonna be real with you, Cal.

2074
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,714
I came in here to say,

2075
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,253
thank you.

2076
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:13,257
Now, I ain't want
to say this in front of everybody,

2077
01:24:13,423 --> 01:24:14,595
but you right.

2078
01:24:14,758 --> 01:24:17,978
Selling the shop is the best
thing for your family,

2079
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:20,605
and the perfect excuse for me to get out.

2080
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:21,981
Go on and retire.

2081
01:24:22,474 --> 01:24:24,442
Retire? You?

2082
01:24:25,936 --> 01:24:28,155
Thought you'd die before
you left that shop, Eddie.

2083
01:24:28,313 --> 01:24:29,439
Yeah.

2084
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:33,577
I ain't dying in that old
raggedy-ass unisexual shop.

2085
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:34,827
<i>What. ..</i>

2086
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:37,081
I can't even recognize
that place no more.

2087
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:38,240
Hell...

2088
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,830
I don't even recognize
the neighborhood no more.

2089
01:24:40,993 --> 01:24:42,336
Yeah.

2090
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:44,921
Got that right.

2091
01:24:45,455 --> 01:24:47,253
All the more reason

2092
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,587
for you to just go on over
there to the North Side.

2093
01:24:58,635 --> 01:24:59,887
I know what you're doing, Eddie.

2094
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:02,686
It's not easy, man.

2095
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,351
Hell, no, it ain't easy. Hell, no.

2096
01:25:06,184 --> 01:25:08,437
We black. It's hard.

2097
01:25:08,604 --> 01:25:11,323
Hard and us go hand in hand.

2098
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:13,609
But we ain't never gave up.

2099
01:25:13,984 --> 01:25:15,201
I didn't give up.

2100
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:17,029
I gave out.

2101
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:19,323
I'm tired, Eddie.

2102
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:22,125
I'm tired, too.

2103
01:25:22,284 --> 01:25:24,036
We've been up 38 hours.

2104
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:27,130
<i>(BOTH LAUGH</i>

2105
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,839
Anthony's gone.

2106
01:25:38,342 --> 01:25:40,060
And that hurts like hell.

2107
01:25:40,802 --> 01:25:45,524
But we done lost a whole bunch more
if we didn't do that ceasefire.

2108
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:47,851
Now we lost one.

2109
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:50,062
He was special.

2110
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:54,575
But we probably saved
more lives than we know.

2111
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:58,579
And for that reason alone is
reason to keep up the fight.

2112
01:26:05,077 --> 01:26:06,829
- What's good, bro?
- Yo.

2113
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:09,748
I can't do this, man.

2114
01:26:09,915 --> 01:26:10,916
What?

2115
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:12,209
I gotta walk away.

2116
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,049
So you just gonna leave me
out here with Yummy alone?

2117
01:26:14,211 --> 01:26:16,179
I ain't leave you nowhere, man.

2118
01:26:16,338 --> 01:26:17,430
You ain't got to do this either.

2119
01:26:17,923 --> 01:26:19,391
Can't believe you doing this to me, yo.

2120
01:26:20,926 --> 01:26:21,927
What?

2121
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,847
Look, my dad let me move
in with him and Terri.

2122
01:26:25,013 --> 01:26:26,014
They've been real cool to me.

2123
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:27,566
I don't want to hear that, man.

2124
01:26:27,724 --> 01:26:29,101
J, what are you thinking?

2125
01:26:29,559 --> 01:26:31,106
I mean, look at what you have here.

2126
01:26:31,269 --> 01:26:32,942
Everything you need is right here.

2127
01:26:33,105 --> 01:26:35,449
You got a moms, you got a dad.

2128
01:26:35,649 --> 01:26:36,946
I'm not doing this.

2129
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,282
If you were smart, you'd do the same.

2130
01:26:58,255 --> 01:26:59,598
Do I need to check the closet?

2131
01:27:00,924 --> 01:27:02,392
You been gone all of this time,

2132
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:04,474
<i>ain't answered none of my messages</i>

2133
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,434
and you come here playing.

2134
01:27:11,226 --> 01:27:12,648
I'm sorry.

2135
01:27:14,312 --> 01:27:15,438
I don't wanna fight.

2136
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:20,493
With everything going on
right now, with Anthony,

2137
01:27:21,153 --> 01:27:22,621
<i>we shouldn't be like this.</i>

2138
01:27:23,405 --> 01:27:24,577
I agree.

2139
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:29,837
And I'm sorry about that Draya mess.

2140
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:31,588
Nothing happened.

2141
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:33,627
But I shouldn't have
put you in that position.

2142
01:27:36,001 --> 01:27:37,503
I know nothing happened.

2143
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:39,971
You're just an idiot.

2144
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:43,805
I'm just a man, baby.

2145
01:27:45,177 --> 01:27:46,679
I get it.

2146
01:27:48,013 --> 01:27:50,186
And I know I've been working a lot.

2147
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,778
But I need you to know

2148
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:58,282
that I see everything you do.

2149
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:02,031
You're an amazing man, Rashad.

2150
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,196
You're an amazing father to Maya.

2151
01:28:05,113 --> 01:28:07,957
I could never ask for
a better partner than you.

2152
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:11,541
I guess I just figured

2153
01:28:12,829 --> 01:28:14,706
you knew how I felt.

2154
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:16,379
I do.

2155
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,719
But sometimes a brother needs to hear it.

2156
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,516
One-Stop, can you sign this?

2157
01:28:24,674 --> 01:28:26,392
N0 doubt.

2158
01:28:26,551 --> 01:28:28,895
Thank <i>you, baby.</i>

2159
01:28:30,305 --> 01:28:31,978
<i>Oh, this is crazy, man.</i>

2160
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:34,063
<i>Bree, you</i> wanna <i>sign the card?</i>

2161
01:28:34,226 --> 01:28:35,899
<i>Yo, Jerrod, check it out.</i>

2162
01:28:38,230 --> 01:28:40,073
<i>Hey, what's up, everybody?</i>

2163
01:28:40,232 --> 01:28:42,234
Before y'all pack up your stuff,

2164
01:28:42,400 --> 01:28:44,243
<i>can I talk to you for a minute?</i>

2165
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,745
Just real quick.

2166
01:28:53,912 --> 01:28:56,540
Go on in now, say what you gotta say.

2167
01:28:59,876 --> 01:29:01,253
I was wrong.

2168
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:05,719
<i>The reason I wanted to end the ceasefire</i>

2169
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,515
is the same reason why I
wanted to move the shop to the North Side.

2170
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:13,356
Man, I was hurt.

2171
01:29:14,391 --> 01:29:15,768
Disappointed.

2172
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:19,609
<i>But y'all know me.</i>

2173
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,949
Y'all know I got love for the South Side.

2174
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,204
I got love for everybody
in this neighborhood.

2175
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:32,117
I got love for everybody in here.

2176
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,627
<i>All my customers,</i>

2177
01:29:35,453 --> 01:29:37,922
even the ones that don't know
how to go home.

2178
01:29:42,168 --> 01:29:43,169
What?

2179
01:29:44,254 --> 01:29:45,722
Are y'all gonna play me like that?

2180
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:49,134
So after a while, it just...

2181
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,929
It just became easier to just walk away.

2182
01:29:52,721 --> 01:29:54,439
<i>Walk away from all this pain.</i>

2183
01:29:55,432 --> 01:29:56,934
All the hurt.

2184
01:29:59,144 --> 01:30:00,646
That ain't right either.

2185
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:04,734
<i>If we don't do something for
this neighborhood, who will?</i>

2186
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,653
<i>At the end of the day
we can't expect people</i>

2187
01:30:08,278 --> 01:30:10,997
who don't know nothing about
what's going on around here,

2188
01:30:11,156 --> 01:30:13,909
to come in here and solve our problems.

2189
01:30:15,994 --> 01:30:18,122
We gotta fix our problems ourself.

2190
01:30:19,956 --> 01:30:21,833
So what are you saying, Calvin?

2191
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:24,845
I'm saying I wanna continue
what we started.

<i>I want to put the ceasefire
back on for the neighborhood.</i>

officially back on.

2198

<i>Live from the South Side,

2336
01:35:23,927 --> 01:35:25,600
I need your help. It's Jalen.

2337
01:35:25,762 --> 01:35:27,139
- What's going on with Jalen?
- He's about to do this

2338
01:35:27,305 --> 01:35:28,477
initiation with the Vice Lords.

2339
01:35:28,640 --> 01:35:29,641
Look, I tried to tell him not to.

2340
01:35:29,807 --> 01:35:31,024
Where's he at, Kenny?

2341
01:35:31,184 --> 01:35:32,481
He's at the park.
Cornell Square.

2342
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:34,483
Cal!

2343
01:35:34,979 --> 01:35:36,981
Hell, yeah,
that's what I like to hear.

2344
01:35:37,148 --> 01:35:39,150
You all ready? You all ready?

2345
01:35:39,984 --> 01:35:41,156
YUMMYI Yeah.

2346
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,321
What's up, man?

2347
01:35:44,656 --> 01:35:45,999
Where your little homie Kenny at?

2348
01:35:47,951 --> 01:35:49,999
I don't know.
I think his dad said he had to come home.

2349
01:35:50,495 --> 01:35:52,623
Stay home? You playing, right?

2350
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,586
Stay home?

2351
01:35:55,375 --> 01:35:57,002
You think this a joke?

2352
01:35:58,461 --> 01:36:00,179
You think this is a game, nigga?

2353
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:03,634
<i>We're concerned about the people</i>

2354
01:36:03,800 --> 01:36:05,143
<i>that Jalen's been hanging around with.</i>

2355
01:36:05,301 --> 01:36:06,894
<i>Are you trying
to say Jalen's in</i> a <i>gang?</i>

2356
01:36:07,053 --> 01:36:08,555
Not trying to get that call
in the middle of the night

2357
01:36:08,721 --> 01:36:10,689
saying my son is locked up or worse,

2358
01:36:10,848 --> 01:36:13,226
<i>because we didn't act
when we had a chance.</i>

2359
01:36:13,393 --> 01:36:14,986
See, that's the problem right there.

2360
01:36:15,311 --> 01:36:16,984
Everybody wanna be down,

2361
01:36:17,146 --> 01:36:19,194
nobody want to put in the work.

2362
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:21,450
Didn't Quis say to chill this weekend?

2363
01:36:21,651 --> 01:36:24,621
Nigga. Marquis?

2364
01:36:25,989 --> 01:36:27,536
Nigga, I ain't worried about Marquis.

2365
01:36:28,574 --> 01:36:29,917
Know what? You playing me right now.

2366
01:36:30,076 --> 01:36:31,419
You wasting my time right now.

2367
01:36:32,036 --> 01:36:33,709
I think he wasting my time.

2368
01:36:35,748 --> 01:36:37,170
Ain't no going home, nigga.

2369
01:36:37,333 --> 01:36:38,835
Ain't no such thing.

2370
01:36:39,002 --> 01:36:40,003
<i>Why are you
trying to take everything</i>

2371
01:36:40,169 --> 01:36:41,421
<i>- I like away from me?
- Because I love you...</i>

2372
01:36:41,587 --> 01:36:42,839
<i>My life would be
so much better if you...</i>

2373
01:36:43,006 --> 01:36:44,223
We raised a <i>smart kid.</i>

2374
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:45,429
You need to make a decision.

2375
01:36:46,843 --> 01:36:49,221
Are you riding or not?

2376
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:40,147
<i>ALL". Ten, nine, eight,</i>

2377
01:37:40,313 --> 01:37:43,112
seven, six, five,

01:37:43,274 --> 01:37:46,278
four, three, two...

2379
01:37:46,444 --> 01:37:47,741
one!

2380
01:37:47,904 --> 01:37:49,622
Yeah!

2381
01:37:53,368 --> 01:37:54,961
<i>ONE-STOP". That's what I'm talking about!</i>

2382
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:56,666
<i>Yeah, baby! All right!</i>

2383
01:38:01,876 --> 01:38:03,423
Ah!Ah!Ah!

2384
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:04,629
- Bam!
- Your daddy gonna be proud.

2385
01:38:04,796 --> 01:38:06,093
Your dad will be so proud of you.

2386
01:38:06,255 --> 01:38:07,256
- You did a good job.
- I feel good.

2387
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:08,470
Ifeelgood.

2388
01:38:09,967 --> 01:38:11,935
Hey. yo, Shad. Hey, man!

2389
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,309
Much love, dude.
I'm sorry about everything.

2390
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:16,850
- I love you, boy.
- I love you, bro. Love you.

2391
01:38:17,308 --> 01:38:18,309
Wow.

2392
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:20,486
Two black dads getting along.

2393
01:38:30,822 --> 01:38:31,869
Let me ask you something.

2394
01:38:32,073 --> 01:38:35,168
Urn, I don't come off as gay, do I?

2395
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:38,045
I mean, I've heard that,
like, twice already today.

2396
01:38:38,204 --> 01:38:40,377
No.
Now, do I think that you could

2397
01:38:40,540 --> 01:38:43,635
maybe afford to own one less
pastel-colored T-shirt

2398
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:45,215
and go up a size in the jean department?

2399
01:38:45,378 --> 01:38:46,880
Yes, absolutely.

2400
01:38:47,046 --> 01:38:48,514
But who cares?

2401
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:50,516
Clothes don't signify someone's sexuality.

2402
01:38:50,675 --> 01:38:52,177
And even if you were gay...

2403
01:38:52,343 --> 01:38:54,892
I'm not. For the record. I'm not.

2404
01:38:55,054 --> 01:38:57,227
It wouldn't matter to me anyway.

2405
01:38:57,390 --> 01:39:00,519
I like who you are and you shouldn't feel
pressured to change for anybody.

2406
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:02,694
And there's no rules on
how to be a straight dude.

2407
01:39:02,854 --> 01:39:03,855
Look at Miguel.

2408
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:05,155
Look at Prince.

2409
01:39:05,314 --> 01:39:07,692
Homeboy be rocking
six-inch stilettos and a perm,

2410
01:39:07,859 --> 01:39:08,860
and he can still get it.

2411
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:10,027
Yes, he can.

2412
01:39:11,237 --> 01:39:13,080
I'm messing with you.
Playing the whole...

2413
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:14,536
- That's. ..
- Anyway.

2414
01:39:15,867 --> 01:39:17,790
So, you like my personality?

2415
01:39:19,162 --> 01:39:22,041
What can I say?
I find your neuroses entertaining.

2416
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:25,714
Your passion for
women's rights liberating.

2417
01:39:26,252 --> 01:39:27,253
And, um...

2418
01:39:29,630 --> 01:39:31,257
I find your nerdiness

2419
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:33,222
incredibly sexy.

2420
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:37,187
Wow.

2421
01:39:38,264 --> 01:39:39,891
Talking to me?

2422
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:41,896
And that's why I like you.

2423
01:39:42,059 --> 01:39:43,060
Because you get me.

2424
01:39:43,561 --> 01:39:46,189
Not a lot of people do,
but you definitely do.

2425
01:39:46,355 --> 01:39:48,733
And just so you know, Ronnie, your ex,

2426
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,403
he was never good enough for you.

2427
01:40:03,414 --> 01:40:04,791
I think I'm in love with you.

2428
01:40:04,957 --> 01:40:07,255
And I want to shout it from the rooftops.

2429
01:40:07,877 --> 01:40:09,595
- Oh... Too soon?
- Yeah.

2430
01:40:09,795 --> 01:40:11,388
- That's what I thought.
- Yeah.

2431
01:40:11,589 --> 01:40:13,762
I mean... What'd you hear?
You heard that I said

2432
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:15,768
- I was in love with you?
- No.

2433
01:40:16,052 --> 01:40:17,053
Rewind that.

2434
01:40:17,220 --> 01:40:18,221
How about dinner tomorrow night?

2435
01:40:18,387 --> 01:40:19,388
- Okay.
- That makes sense.

2436
01:40:19,555 --> 01:40:20,556
Yeah. That's...

2437
01:40:20,765 --> 01:40:22,108
I went from a broken home,

2438
01:40:22,391 --> 01:40:24,644
-so I give affection very fast.
- Oh, my Lord. My Lord.

2439
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,483
Yeah. Yeah.

2440
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:30,066
You got a lot of nerve showing up here.

2441
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,952
- I came to apologize, Terri.
- I don't want to hear it.

2442
01:40:33,110 --> 01:40:34,737
Well, I wanna say it anyway.

2443
01:40:37,740 --> 01:40:39,868
Listen, I'm really sorry.

2444
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,374
I should have never come
between you and Rashad.

2445
01:40:42,578 --> 01:40:43,921
Damn right.

2446
01:40:44,163 --> 01:40:46,632
It's just that you have your
whole life taken care of,

2447
01:40:46,791 --> 01:40:48,418
and figured out. And...

2448
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:51,679
I'm like, still trying to figure out
every little thing about mine.

2449
01:40:53,297 --> 01:40:55,015
I made a mistake.

2450
01:40:55,174 --> 01:40:57,802
It'll never, ever happen again.
I promise you that.

2451
01:40:59,095 --> 01:41:00,312
Well...

2452
01:41:01,347 --> 01:41:02,974
I appreciate you saying that.

2453
01:41:03,307 --> 01:41:05,435
Does that mean we're cool?

2454
01:41:07,353 --> 01:41:08,354
I guess.

2455
01:41:08,604 --> 01:41:09,651
Come here, girl!

2456
01:41:13,442 --> 01:41:14,443
anyway- --

2457
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:17,159
I did want to tell you
that if you and Rashad

2458
01:41:17,321 --> 01:41:19,619
was looking for, like,
a third girl to help you out,

2459
01:41:19,782 --> 01:41:21,659
you know, get it poppin'
or anything like that,

2460
01:41:21,826 --> 01:41:23,043
I would be down for that.

2461
01:41:23,286 --> 01:41:24,503
Mull it over.

2462
01:41:24,787 --> 01:41:25,788
'Bye, Draya.
- Hey, hey.

2463
01:41:25,955 --> 01:41:27,047
Hey, hey, hey-

2464
01:41:27,206 --> 01:41:28,879
We need to at least hear her out now.

2465
01:41:29,041 --> 01:41:30,793
I mean, she ain't
come this way for nothing.

2466
01:41:30,960 --> 01:41:32,462
<i>- Hey,</i> Rashad!
<i>- What's good, Draya?</i>

2467
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:33,629
- Get in the house.
- Baby.

2468

<i>You think it's funny.
You're not funny.</i>

2469
01:41:35,673 --> 01:41:36,765
CALVINI Thanks.

2470
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:40,682
This is not what you think it is.

2471
01:41:41,512 --> 01:41:43,310
This is that bird I talked about.
Remember that?

2472
01:41:43,472 --> 01:41:44,473
It went away.

2473
01:41:46,017 --> 01:41:48,190
It flew away. Let 'em fly.

2474
01:41:53,649 --> 01:41:54,821
Know why I came back?

2475
01:41:54,984 --> 01:41:56,702
- Why?
- Because you my man.

2476
01:41:57,153 --> 01:41:58,245
I came back to you.

2477
01:41:58,529 --> 01:41:59,997
Why don't you just give me the damn check?

2478
01:42:00,156 --> 01:42:01,203
My man.

2479
01:42:01,407 --> 01:42:02,499
That's your section.

2480
01:42:02,658 --> 01:42:04,160
- No booth rent.
- We're clear?

2481
01:42:04,327 --> 01:42:05,328
Do you.

2482
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:06,871
My man. It's a pleasure, my brother.

2483
01:42:07,079 --> 01:42:08,672
<i>You will do good business, my brother.</i>

2484
01:42:08,831 --> 01:42:10,048
You have a good day!

2485
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:12,084
Hit these streets. Oh! Hey! Hey!

2486
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,004
I need to talk to you.
You got to sign some paperwork, brother.

2487
01:42:15,171 --> 01:42:16,718
<i>Your wife trying to find you.</i>

2488
01:42:16,881 --> 01:42:18,679
<i>You're gonna run from me, really?</i>

2489
01:42:22,178 --> 01:42:23,600
Yo, man, we closed.

2490
01:42:23,763 --> 01:42:24,889
Come back tomorrow.

2491
01:42:25,056 --> 01:42:26,558
Man, that's too bad.

2492
01:42:29,393 --> 01:42:31,566
I was really hoping you could fit me in.

2493
01:42:33,397 --> 01:42:35,070
I think I got room for one more.

2494
01:42:40,738 --> 01:42:42,240
Have a seat.

2495
01:42:47,244 --> 01:42:49,338
Glad you came, man.

2496
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:52,754
Just wanted to do something about this
so-called abomination you say.

2497
01:42:54,085 --> 01:42:55,962
I'll hook you up,
don't worry about nothin'.

2498
01:42:56,212 --> 01:42:58,214
Edge you up real quick.

2499
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:01,100
<i>Uh...</i> I was thinking,

2500
01:43:01,300 --> 01:43:02,768
start off fresh.

2501
01:43:08,265 --> 01:43:09,312
You sure?

2502
01:43:10,559 --> 01:43:11,560
Positive.

2503
01:43:13,437 --> 01:43:14,438
All right.

2504
01:43:14,605 --> 01:43:15,902
Start you off fresh.

2505
01:43:17,149 --> 01:43:19,277
You know, I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

2506
01:43:20,277 --> 01:43:22,450
You've always been there
for me for everything,

2507
01:43:22,613 --> 01:43:23,990
and I appreciate it.

2508
01:43:26,367 --> 01:43:27,459
Love you, Dad.

2509
01:43:28,452 --> 01:43:29,874
I love you, too, man.

2510
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,998
Always gonna be my guy.

2511
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:33,340
I swear.

2512
01:43:34,959 --> 01:43:38,179
All right. Let's see how
we can hook you up here.

2513
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:40,639
Yeah, okay.

2514
01:43:41,340 --> 01:43:42,512
Now, listen...

2515
01:43:42,967 --> 01:43:44,514
I hear about anything,

2516
01:43:44,677 --> 01:43:46,304
I'm snatching you right up
out of there, you hear me?

2517
01:43:46,470 --> 01:43:48,222
- Yeah, I hear you.
-l'm not playing.

2518
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:50,149
Be up there quick fast in a hurry.

2519
01:43:50,307 --> 01:43:53,777
I escort you to the bathroom
and everything if I have to.

2520
01:43:56,355 --> 01:43:57,777
Crazy, Dad.

2521
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,613
But I'm fine with that.

2522
01:43:59,775 --> 01:44:02,153
I'm just happy to stay here.
Happy to be home.

2523
01:44:04,196 --> 01:44:05,573
I'm happy you back.

2524
01:44:05,823 --> 01:44:07,496
See me hooping this year, right?

2525
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,660
You got to penetrate more.
Too manyjumpers.

2526
01:44:09,827 --> 01:44:10,874
But they go in though.

2527
01:44:11,036 --> 01:44:12,504
Not all
the time, they don't go in.

2528
01:44:12,663 --> 01:44:14,165
Oh, man...

2529
01:44:15,541 --> 01:44:17,339
You don't wanna rock
your dreads like that, man?

2530
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:20,509
Now if you end up on the Bulls,
your daddy got to go everywhere with you.

2531
01:44:20,713 --> 01:44:22,431
l'm gonna be the team barber.

2532
01:44:22,923 --> 01:44:23,924
Damn, man.

2533
01:44:24,133 --> 01:44:25,430
All right.

2534
01:44:25,801 --> 01:44:26,848
Slow down.

2535
01:44:27,303 --> 01:44:28,304
H93'-

2536
01:44:28,554 --> 01:44:31,524
You ain't comb your hair in six months,
it's a little nappy down there.

2537
01:44:31,682 --> 01:44:34,356
All kind of cucabugs back here. Beebees.

2538
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,903
You gonna be all right.

2539
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:39,528
Yeah. That's it.

2540
01:44:41,275 --> 01:44:42,276
Oh.

2541
01:44:43,486 --> 01:44:45,033
Look fresh.

2542
01:44:46,197 --> 01:44:48,245
Now you look like my son again.

2543
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:50,539
I'm getting all the shorties
at school now.

2544
01:44:51,368 --> 01:44:52,369
Yeah.

2545
01:44:52,536 --> 01:44:54,254
Now you can sweep up the hair.

2546
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:57,750
Dear Chicago,

2547
01:44:57,917 --> 01:45:00,090
<i>I know I was hard on you before,</i>

2548
01:45:00,252 --> 01:45:01,720
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

2549
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:04,052
<i>- If there's one thing I know about you,</i>

2550
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:06,767
<i>is that you know how to bounce back.</i>

2551
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:11,522
<i>And we salute
Chicago's own South Side Champs.</i>

2552
01:45:14,892 --> 01:45:15,939
Chicago, stand up.

2553
01:45:16,101 --> 01:45:17,569
Chicago, stand up.

2554
01:45:17,728 --> 01:45:20,106
We want them to believe in themselves.

2555
01:45:20,272 --> 01:45:22,240
<i>We want them to believe
in their community.</i>

2556
01:45:22,399 --> 01:45:24,572
<i>We want them to believe
that they have a future.</i>

2557
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:26,954
We are college bound.
We are exceptional.

2558
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:29,410
Not because we say it,
but because we work hard at it.

2559
01:45:29,573 --> 01:45:31,325
Hey! Congratulations, Miss Paxton.

2560
01:45:35,412 --> 01:45:39,713
<i>You've always taken personal
tragedy and turned it into triumph.</i>

2561
01:45:40,084 --> 01:45:41,131
No, don't do it...

2562
01:45:41,544 --> 01:45:43,091
Give me that!

2563
01:45:43,254 --> 01:45:44,756
<i>- Yeah.</i> Yeah.
- No, no, no!

2564
01:45:45,089 --> 01:45:46,636
- Breaking down like LeBron!
- Oh.

2565
01:45:46,799 --> 01:45:48,346
- Know that. Know that.
- Yeah.

2566
01:45:49,426 --> 01:45:50,928
<i>That's why
I'm not giving up on you.</i>

2567
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:53,013
There we go. This what we running.

2568
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:56,066
<i>Because you never gave up on me.</i>

2569
01:46:00,437 --> 01:46:01,654
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2570
01:46:02,231 --> 01:46:04,279
- Who won? Who won?
- Boom, every time.

2571
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,235
Mr. Wilson!

2572
01:46:09,822 --> 01:46:12,166
<i>And I know whatever happens,</i>

2573
01:46:12,449 --> 01:46:13,917
<i>eventually,</i>

2574
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,498
<i>Chicago,</i>

2575
01:46:15,828 --> 01:46:18,126
<i>you'll find your way back home.</i>

2576
01:46:18,455 --> 01:46:20,128
<i>You always do.</i>

2577
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:24,086
What's up?

2578
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:30,138
Yeah, who won? What's the real story?

2579
01:46:30,301 --> 01:46:31,518
What's the real story?

2580
01:46:31,969 --> 01:46:33,346
Who won? Who won?

2581
01:46:34,805 --> 01:46:36,432
<i>Let's just stick to cutting hair, right?</i>

2582
01:46:41,312 --> 01:46:43,781
<i>What can
the people of Chicago take away from this?</i>

2583
01:46:43,939 --> 01:46:47,159
It's a reminder that the individual,
or, in this case, individuals,

2584
01:46:47,318 --> 01:46:48,490
can make a big difference.

2585
01:46:48,819 --> 01:46:50,321
<i>As a former barber in the shop,</i>

2586
01:46:50,487 --> 01:46:52,330
<i>-it's been very inspiring...
-ls that Jimmy James?</i>

2587
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:53,490
<i>...for me to see the people of community</i>

2588
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:54,658
<i>come together and show the world</i>

2589
01:46:54,825 --> 01:46:56,498
<i>that there's still hope on the South Side.</i>

2590
01:46:56,660 --> 01:46:58,708
- Mr. James!
- Ms. Cruz.

2591
01:46:58,871 --> 01:47:00,498
<i>In light
of the success of the ceasefire,</i>

2592
01:47:00,664 --> 01:47:02,666
<i>have you personally changed
your mind about the enclosure,</i>

2593
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:05,677
<i>and do you think it'll have any effect
on the upcoming council vote?</i>

2594
01:47:05,836 --> 01:47:06,883
Go ahead, Jimmy.

2595
01:47:07,046 --> 01:47:08,343
<i>Well, I can't speak for the council,</i>

2596
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:11,475
<i>but I'd be shocked if they voted yes,
when so many have voted against it.</i>

2597
01:47:12,009 --> 01:47:13,056
<i>See, the whole point of the enclosure</i>

2598
01:47:13,218 --> 01:47:14,595
<i>was to decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

2599
01:47:15,012 --> 01:47:16,514
<i>And I think that
Mr. Palmer and Ms. Norris</i>

2600
01:47:16,680 --> 01:47:17,681
Oh!

2601
01:47:17,848 --> 01:47:18,849
<i>and the rest of the team down at the shop</i>

2602
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:20,689
<i>found a way to do just that.</i>

2603
01:47:21,101 --> 01:47:22,227
<i>- That's right!</i>
<i>- Whoo!</i>

2604
01:47:22,770 --> 01:47:23,771
EDDIEI Yeah!

2605
01:47:27,733 --> 01:47:29,531
Dad! You see this?

2606
01:47:31,528 --> 01:47:32,745
- Man, that's got to...
- No, it ain't.

2607
01:47:32,905 --> 01:47:34,031
Oh! Serious?

2608
01:47:34,198 --> 01:47:35,199
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa! Whoa!

2609
01:47:35,366 --> 01:47:36,709
Oh, my <i>God.</i>

2610
01:47:36,867 --> 01:47:38,915
- Hey, everybody!
- Hell, no.

2611
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:40,125
It's good to see you.

2612
01:47:40,371 --> 01:47:41,372
- How are you?
- Mr. President.

2613
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:42,539
- How you doing?
-l'm doing great.

2614
01:47:42,706 --> 01:47:43,707
<i>I like that sharp suit.</i>

2615
01:47:43,874 --> 01:47:45,217
- Hey, I'll get you one.
-l'm gonna hold you to that.

2616
01:47:45,376 --> 01:47:46,377
- Gotcha.
<i>- Okay.</i>

2617
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:48,386
Mr. President, how you doing, sir?

2618
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:51,424
You know, it's good to be back
where it all started for me.

2619
01:47:51,674 --> 01:47:52,721
The South Side.

2620
01:47:52,883 --> 01:47:54,806
- I told you.
- Hey, Eddie!

2621
01:47:55,552 --> 01:47:57,725
Very good to see you. Good to see you.

2622
01:47:58,055 --> 01:47:59,056
Take that jacket off.

2623
01:47:59,264 --> 01:48:00,732
- Should I say hi?
- Yeah.

2624
01:48:00,891 --> 01:48:01,892
- Hi!
- How <i>you doing?</i>

2625
01:48:02,059 --> 01:48:03,231
Have a seat right there.

2626
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:06,442
I was telling these kids
how I used to cut

2627
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:08,448
- your hair back in the day.
- You sure did.

2628
01:48:08,607 --> 01:48:10,075
You was running around here organizing.

2629
01:48:10,234 --> 01:48:11,406
You know, I gotta get a picture of this.

2630
01:48:11,568 --> 01:48:12,865
- Calvin, take this picture.
- Yeah.

2631
01:48:13,070 --> 01:48:14,413
Bam!

2632
01:48:14,571 --> 01:48:16,949
How you doing, Mr. President?
My name's Calvin.

2633
01:48:17,116 --> 01:48:18,709
I own the shop with Angie right here.

2634
01:48:18,867 --> 01:48:19,868
-I'm Angie. Hi.
- Yeah.

2635
01:48:20,035 --> 01:48:21,036
<i>We appreciate your small business.</i>

2636
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:23,080
Hey, Mr. President.
New Democrat right here.

2637
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:24,794
All right! Congratulations!

2638
01:48:26,291 --> 01:48:27,292
Stop acting all nervous, Eddie.

2639
01:48:27,501 --> 01:48:28,798
You know you know what you're doing.
Come on, man.

2640
01:48:28,961 --> 01:48:31,259
I cut the man's hair years ago.
I know what I'm doing right here.

2641
01:48:31,422 --> 01:48:32,423
Um...

2642
01:48:32,589 --> 01:48:34,057
Mr. President, I just want to say,

2643
01:48:34,216 --> 01:48:36,594
you know, I really love what you've done
for the black community.

2644
01:48:36,802 --> 01:48:38,600
<i>All right.
And I'm loving those pants.</i>

2645
01:48:38,762 --> 01:48:40,730
- Oh, thank you.
- Appreciate your patriotism.

2646
01:48:40,889 --> 01:48:42,266
I salute you, too.

2647
01:48:43,934 --> 01:48:45,436
Barry. Come on, now.

2648
01:48:45,602 --> 01:48:46,603
I'm sorry.

2649
01:48:46,770 --> 01:48:49,239
Okay, here we go. Low like you always do?

2650
01:48:49,398 --> 01:48:50,945
Come on, now, hook your man up.

2651
01:48:51,108 --> 01:48:52,951
- Little bit.
- Are you shaking, Eddie?

2652
01:48:53,152 --> 01:48:54,449
Eddie, you got it.

2653
01:48:54,737 --> 01:48:56,284
Come on, Eddie. Represent now.

2654
01:49:02,161 --> 01:49:03,287
<i>Eddie!</i>

2655
01:49:03,620 --> 01:49:05,122
One-Stop,

2656
01:49:06,081 --> 01:49:07,458
you got some salve?

2657
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,252
<i>I can fix it! I can fix it!</i>

2658
01:49:10,419 --> 01:49:11,636
<i>Sit back down!</i>
