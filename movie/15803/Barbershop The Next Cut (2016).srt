00:00:16,601 --> 00:00:19,604
<i>Yes, sir, it's Cayman Kelly
stretching and yawning,</i>

2
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:21,356
<i>and wishing you a good morning!</i>

3
00:00:21,523 --> 00:00:23,525
<i>Right now, it's about
55 degrees and cloudy,</i>

4
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:25,568
<i>and I want everybody
to have a blessed day</i>

5
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:28,780
<i>and do what you can to love yourself
and love one another.</i>

6
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:31,324
<i>Peace, Chicago. Let's do this!</i>

7
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,713
<i>Dear Chicago,</i>

8
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:48,633
<i>the world knows you as
the birthplace of the skyscraper,</i>

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,093
<i>deep dish pizza,</i>

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,344
<i>Don Cornelius,</i>

11
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:52,595
<i>Kanye West,</i>

12
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:54,723
<i>and the home of the Cubs, Bulls,</i>

13
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,517
<i>and undisputed queen
of daytime television,</i>

14
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:59,185
<i>Oprah.</i>

15
00:00:59,561 --> 00:01:01,604
<i>And of course, yours truly.</i>

16
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:04,691
<i>But to me, you're much more than that.</i>

17
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:07,235
<i>You're the place that raised me,</i>

18
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:09,028
<i>the place I call home.</i>

19
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:11,156
<i>And I'll never forget what you gave me.</i>

20
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:14,159
<i>My first kiss,</i>

21
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,703
<i>with mean-ass Shonda Wilkins.</i>

22
00:01:20,832 --> 00:01:22,041
<i>My first fight...</i>

23
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:25,545
<i>And first ass-whooping
from Boobie Monroe.</i>

24
00:01:27,672 --> 00:01:31,009
<i>And of course, my first love,
my wife, Jennifer,</i>

25
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:35,054
<i>who gave me the greatest gift
a man could ever ask for...</i>

26
00:01:35,221 --> 00:01:37,390
<i>My son, Jalen Palmer.</i>

27
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:45,648
<i>Yeah.</i>

28
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:47,817
You know how we do.
South Side Chicago, baby!

29
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:50,111
South Side, baby.
Yes, sir, 79th Street all day.

30
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,446
- Yes, sir.
- It don't stop.

31
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:52,757
<i>I just wanna say thank you.</i>

32
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:53,782
<i>For what?</i>

33
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,108
For introducing me to Rashad.

34
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,510
Ah, y'all gonna be divorced in a minute.

35
00:01:56,534 --> 00:01:58,036
Oh.

36
00:01:58,203 --> 00:02:00,079
No, I'm just playing with you.

37
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:01,915
<i>Not to mention,</i>

38
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:03,625
<i>lifelong friendship</i>

39
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,752
<i>and family.</i>

40
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:09,798
<i>And the birth of a new era.</i>

41
00:02:09,964 --> 00:02:12,383
Yes, we can! Yes, we can!

42
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:15,178
<i>So I hope you know
it's out of love that I say this.</i>

43
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:16,346
<i>But recently,</i>

44
00:02:16,513 --> 00:02:18,890
<i>things ain't been the same
between me and you.</i>

45
00:02:20,475 --> 00:02:21,702
<i>Lately, you've been out of control.</i>

46
00:02:21,726 --> 00:02:23,895
<i>At least 24 people
were shot and injured.</i>

47
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,731
<i>Police believe most shootings
were gang-related.</i>

48
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:29,338
<i>And I'm not the only one
that feels this way, Chicago.</i>

49
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,653
We've just gone to a new low.
When you now...

50
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,380
<i>There used to be a day
when there was a code.</i>

51
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,757
<i>You didn't kill children.
You didn't kill mothers.</i>

52
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,534
<i>You didn't kill grandmothers.
There is no boundary.</i>

53
00:02:37,742 --> 00:02:39,577
Children are dying in the street.

54
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,305
We have to stop the violence.

55
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,705
<i>The streets are talking.</i>

56
00:02:43,248 --> 00:02:44,415
<i>They're tired.</i>

57
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,795
<i>They're angry.</i>

58
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,640
<i>WBBM news time, 6:32.</i>

59
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:02,660
<i>Violence on Chicago's streets</i>

60
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,769
<i>took no holiday for the long weekend.</i>

61
00:03:04,936 --> 00:03:06,938
<i>Police say at least
eight people were killed,</i>

62
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:09,983
<i>at least 20 others wounded
in shootings since Thursday.</i>

63
00:03:10,149 --> 00:03:12,193
<i>That's an increase over
last year's holiday weekend</i>

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,654
<i>that saw five killed and 14 wounded.</i>

65
00:03:15,113 --> 00:03:16,155
Oh, Lord.

66
00:03:16,739 --> 00:03:17,824
Hey, Eddie. What's up, man?

67
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,577
Calvin, I messed up this time, man.

68
00:03:20,743 --> 00:03:21,887
I'm telling you. I did something wrong.

69
00:03:21,911 --> 00:03:22,912
What?

70
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:25,432
There's a bunch of them Gangster Disciples
down there on the corner,

71
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:26,851
with their pants hanging
all around their ankles.

72
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,435
And I told them how they was a bunch
of conjugal visits gone bad.

73
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:31,605
And they're coming down here.
They're coming after me, Calvin.

74
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:33,047
- I need the strap!
- Strap?

75
00:03:33,298 --> 00:03:34,483
I need the heat! Where's the heater?

76
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,587
Ain't no heat in here, man.

77
00:03:35,717 --> 00:03:36,837
The gun! The gat!

78
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,165
There ain't no gun in this shop.

79
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:39,637
So we ain't got no gun?

80
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:41,366
They're about to come in here with AKs

81
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:42,765
and 47s and Desert Eagles,

82
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,518
and we got nothing but witch hazel!

83
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,646
Eddie. Are you serious?
Because I don't see nobody.

84
00:03:48,855 --> 00:03:50,106
Here they come!

85
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:51,316
- Where?
- Come on!

86
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:53,526
Come on, Calvin! Come on!

87
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,361
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

88
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,030
Shit, man.

89
00:03:57,196 --> 00:03:58,465
What are we gonna do?

90
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,327
You know what, I talked my way into this,

91
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:04,513
maybe I can talk my way out of it.

92
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:06,473
Man, we can go out the back.
Let's just go out the back!

93
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,374
I can't run, Calvin. I'm old.

94
00:04:08,541 --> 00:04:10,019
- Let's go.
- I'm just gonna talk to them.

95
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:11,312
They're young boys,
and I'm gonna talk to them.

96
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,338
Listen, you're not going out there!

97
00:04:13,546 --> 00:04:15,006
Let me get something. Just wait.

98
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:16,674
Calvin! Don't.

99
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:20,887
There we go.

100
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:22,680
<i>Let's be reasonable.</i>

101
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:25,391
<i>Everybody just calm down.
Let me just talk to you.</i>

102
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,685
<i>- Everybody stay cool-headed.</i>
- Shit.

103
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:30,188
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
<i>- Just give me one of--</i>

104
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,231
Leave that man alone! Black lives matter!

105
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,192
He's old and decrepit!

106
00:04:36,694 --> 00:04:38,696
Pedro, <i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

107
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:40,198
Eddie.

108
00:04:40,365 --> 00:04:41,366
You want some?

109
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,117
- Man.
- I got you.

110
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:44,869
I'm tired of this, Eddie.

111
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:52,043
That sandwich was hand-crafted.

112
00:04:55,338 --> 00:04:56,714
<i>And you should have heard!</i>

113
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:58,049
"Black lives matter!"

114
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,216
"Eddie, don't go out there,
they're gonna kill ya!"

115
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,971
He was quivering like
Terrence Howard at the Oscars.

116
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,555
See, Eddie, that's your problem.

117
00:05:04,722 --> 00:05:05,932
You play too damn much, man.

118
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,077
One day, somebody gonna be
chasing your ass for real.

119
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,021
You know what I'mma do?
I'mma let them catch you.

120
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:11,437
Oh, okay, okay.

121
00:05:12,647 --> 00:05:14,232
You know the rules, baby boy.

122
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:15,692
If you like it, you pay.

123
00:05:15,858 --> 00:05:17,498
If you don't like it,
your ass pay anyway.

124
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:19,070
Nice. Nice.

125
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:24,492
Well, Isaac,

126
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:26,703
it's good running into you again.

127
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,951
Man, she know
she ain't never ran a day in her life.

128
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,584
You gonna call me, right?

129
00:05:33,793 --> 00:05:35,211
Oh, uh-huh.

130
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,421
You crazy.

131
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,589
All right. Ow.

132
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:40,174
Yes!

133
00:05:40,425 --> 00:05:42,265
All right, Soror.
Girl, I'll talk to you later.

134
00:05:42,427 --> 00:05:43,428
Bye.

135
00:05:43,594 --> 00:05:44,905
You know you my girl and--

136
00:05:44,929 --> 00:05:46,264
<i>All right, baby girl.</i>

137
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:48,474
See you around.

138
00:05:48,808 --> 00:05:49,809
Damn!

139
00:05:50,101 --> 00:05:52,186
What happened to the barbershop, Calvin?

140
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,033
I used to come here
to get away from women.

141
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,442
Especially the ones I'll never ever
wanna see again as long as I live.

142
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:00,069
You know you love the ladies,
especially the sisters.

143
00:06:00,236 --> 00:06:01,946
Yeah, it's true, I like the sisters. I do.

144
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,448
Just not that one.

145
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:05,780
But homegirl in a catsuit,
though, she could get it.

146
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:06,868
What's good, ma?

147
00:06:07,035 --> 00:06:08,036
Not you, pa.

148
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:10,788
What them
pockets do, little daddy?

149
00:06:10,955 --> 00:06:12,835
You can come over here
and frisk me if you like.

150
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:16,926
Now, I'm gonna keep it
real here for a second.

151
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,504
This was a male sanctuary.

152
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:20,673
This is the original man cave.

153
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,383
<i>And now, it's just a club,</i>

154
00:06:22,675 --> 00:06:24,469
with the lights on, and no drinks.

155
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,803
Oh.

156
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,430
Yo, Isaac. It is what it is, man.

157
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:29,438
The recession ain't never
left the South Side.

158
00:06:29,515 --> 00:06:31,309
Joining forces saved us both.

159
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:33,811
- Well, change is good.
- Mmm-hmm.

160
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:35,289
Everyone be well. Good seeing y'all.

161
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:36,457
- I'll see you around again soon.
- Later.

162
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:37,482
Bye.

163
00:06:37,648 --> 00:06:38,959
Peace. Good luck with everything.

164
00:06:38,983 --> 00:06:39,984
<i>Send me some pictures.</i>

165
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,320
Guychat. Guybarber. Snapchat.

166
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:44,739
Hit me up anytime you want.
I'mma see you later.

167
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,365
He swear he cute.

168
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,096
A'ight, don't get nothing on you now.

169
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:50,471
<i>Look at him. He gonna chase her.</i>

170
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,080
<i>Watch him. Watch him go.</i>

171
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:53,498
Hey, Aisha!

172
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,541
I told you!

173
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:57,543
Y'all see that one?

174
00:06:57,710 --> 00:06:59,003
He like them big like that.

175
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,588
Eddie, not cool.

176
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:03,299
Go on back to your seat,
<i>Poetic Injustice.</i>

177
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,002
- What up?
- What up, pimpin'?

178
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,053
What up, G-ball?

179
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,363
<i>What's hangin', Rashad?</i>

180
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:09,680
What up, J, Bree, Angie?

181
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:10,991
- Hey, Rashad.
- Morning, Rashad.

182
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,201
- Hey, yo, boy.
- Cal, what up?

183
00:07:12,225 --> 00:07:13,452
- What's up with you, man?
- You good?

184
00:07:13,476 --> 00:07:14,516
- Good, I'm good.
- A'ight.

185
00:07:14,685 --> 00:07:15,686
<i>Seriously.</i>

186
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:17,122
Your girl does need to be careful

187
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,357
wearing all of that
red and gold down 79th.

188
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah, man. The Vice Lords don't play that.

189
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,962
You can't just wear their colors
and walk down the street unchecked.

190
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,780
Man, the streets is crazy right now.

191
00:07:25,947 --> 00:07:27,448
I damn near got robbed the other day.

192
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:28,866
I did get robbed the other day.

193
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:32,370
What? Man, I got robbed twice
on the same day on the same block.

194
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:33,996
That ain't shit.

195
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,040
Last week, I got robbed twice

196
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:38,376
and got my ass beat by the second robber

197
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,169
for giving all my money to the first.

198
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,380
She wasn't playing.

199
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,049
I've been living on
the South Side since '52.

200
00:07:45,216 --> 00:07:47,844
I've been robbed,
been shot, been stabbed.

201
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,887
Hell, been stoned, been groped,

202
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:51,514
and almost lynched twice.

203
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:53,683
Nobody tried to lynch your musty ass.

204
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,561
The only reason I'm still here
is because the first time,

205
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,207
they didn't know how to tie the knot.

206
00:07:58,396 --> 00:07:59,939
So I just slipped right out.

207
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:01,482
<i>And second time,</i>

208
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,401
the tree was too short.

209
00:08:05,486 --> 00:08:08,406
Hey, Calvin, I finished reorganizing
that supply closet.

210
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:09,883
You want me to sweep before I go?

211
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:10,950
- No, man.
- You sure?

212
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,451
No. No, go on ahead to school.

213
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:14,453
- You sure, man?
- Yeah, man, positive.

214
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,181
- Here you go.
- Man, I appreciate that for sure.

215
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,248
I appreciate it, too.

216
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:19,268
- I'm gonna see you again next week.
- Okay.

217
00:08:19,292 --> 00:08:20,894
- Take care, Angie.
<i>- You be careful out there.</i>

218
00:08:20,918 --> 00:08:22,503
- Bye, Anthony.
- All right, y'all.

219
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,670
- All right, man. Thanks!
- All right, Chris Beige.

220
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:25,882
Now, don't get robbed.

221
00:08:26,048 --> 00:08:27,049
Oh, you a trip.

222
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,456
<i>Rashad, your son's here!</i>

223
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,033
Hey, what up, everybody? Hey, Angie.

224
00:08:30,136 --> 00:08:31,488
<i>There you go, double trouble.</i>

225
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,832
- What's up, Eddie?
- Good.

226
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:34,450
Hey, what's up, Dad? How's everything?

227
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,435
Pretty good.
Shouldn't you two be at school by now?

228
00:08:37,602 --> 00:08:38,853
Yeah, we on our way.

229
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,860
I just stopped by because
I need to borrow $20.

230
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,232
Dad, come on, I need it.

231
00:08:43,441 --> 00:08:44,442
Angie, you got 20 bucks?

232
00:08:44,609 --> 00:08:45,610
Oh, yeah, I got 20.

233
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:49,071
- Yo, Rashad, you got a dub on you?
- Yes, sir. What up, son?

234
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,032
Does everybody in here that's working...

235
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,283
What up, Dad?

236
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,927
...got at least $20
in their pocket or purse?

237
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,037
- Yeah, I do.
- Indeed, I do.

238
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:58,748
Uh, I had $20, but I got robbed.

239
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,476
That was serious, I ain't make that up.

240
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,668
That bitch was swole.

241
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,254
Not now, Dante. Not now.

242
00:09:05,922 --> 00:09:07,802
Do you know what all these
people got in common?

243
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,050
They old?

244
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,302
- Hold on now.
- Hey!

245
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,470
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

246
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,781
You know, you ain't too grown
to get your butt whooped.

247
00:09:14,805 --> 00:09:16,766
Cal, you want me to take
care of this for you?

248
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,643
- No, I got this.
- Okay.

249
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:19,810
Relax, Adrian Peterson.

250
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:21,646
It's 2016, not 1816.

251
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:25,024
You can't pull kids pants down and spank
their bottoms until it turns red.

252
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:26,609
It's illegal and a little creepy.

253
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,754
Ain't nobody talking
about that Catholic school you went to.

254
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:30,488
Do I look like Father Flanagan?

255
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:33,407
When I was growing up,
ass whippings were like meals,

256
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,743
<i>- and I was well-fed.
- Hey, Kenny.</i>

257
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,162
So, can we maybe get back to the $20?

258
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:39,806
Whatever happened to you coming around

259
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,832
after school every now and then
and helping out?

260
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:44,603
Dad, come on. You know
I'm busy with homework and basketball.

261
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:45,836
We've been busy with work.

262
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:47,797
<i>It's a simple equation, son.</i>

263
00:09:48,005 --> 00:09:50,841
<i>You don't work, you don't get paid. Okay?</i>

264
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,728
This ain't <i>The Oprah Show.</i>
You don't just show up and get free gifts.

265
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,680
A'ight.

266
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:58,158
And I better not find out that
you're late to that school.

267
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,684
Told you, man.

268
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,851
Hey, Kenny.

269
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,062
I seen that.

270
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,355
<i>- Put it back.
- Wow.</i>

271
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:05,523
<i>I saw you, Kenny.</i>

272
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:08,442
Those candy bars
are a dollar apiece, if you want one.

273
00:10:08,609 --> 00:10:09,652
<i>I'm not playing.</i>

274
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:13,281
If not, I'mma assume you took 50
and I'm taking it out your pop's paycheck.

275
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:14,949
And he don't make that much.

276
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:17,827
Not to put your business out there,
but Terri does make more.

277
00:10:19,203 --> 00:10:20,371
Put it back.

278
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,747
<i>Busted!</i>

279
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:24,166
Everybody, check your wallets.

280
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:26,377
<i>He got sticky fingers.</i>

281
00:10:27,628 --> 00:10:29,505
- Y'all have a blessed day.
- Shut up!

282
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,840
<i>"Have a blessed day"?</i>

283
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:32,675
He said, "Have a blessed day."

284
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:36,262
I mean, why your dad's
gotta be so stingy?

285
00:10:36,429 --> 00:10:39,056
Thinking he teaching lessons
and dropping knowledge.

286
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,058
That shit is annoying.

287
00:10:41,225 --> 00:10:42,476
For real, bro.

288
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:43,936
Him and your dad,

289
00:10:44,103 --> 00:10:46,272
always talkin' out
the sides of their face.

290
00:10:46,564 --> 00:10:48,899
Talking about how they repping 79th,

291
00:10:49,066 --> 00:10:51,193
all that nonsense,
South Side, all that stupid shit.

292
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,403
Stupid shit.

293
00:10:57,366 --> 00:10:58,617
What's up, G?

294
00:10:59,368 --> 00:11:00,578
What size is them Jordans?

295
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,247
They my size. That's what size they are.

296
00:11:03,414 --> 00:11:04,832
You think you got heart, huh?

297
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,352
Well, guess what, little nigga.
Hearts ain't bulletproof.

298
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:08,812
Hey, why don't y'all just keep moving?

299
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,230
Y'all out of your neighborhood anyway.

300
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:11,454
Nigga, what you talking about?

301
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:13,483
Y'all know our crew
run this whole neighborhood.

302
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:14,800
We run this whole shit.

303
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:16,802
Hey, yo, shorty, run them kicks.

304
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:19,722
Man, y'all niggas ain't shit.

305
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,391
Yeah, I said it.

306
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,852
Nigga, this our block. You know that.

307
00:11:25,936 --> 00:11:27,897
Unless you really wanna do it.

308
00:11:34,153 --> 00:11:35,154
We out.

309
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:37,281
All right.

310
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:38,488
<i>Yeah, I thought so.</i>

311
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,118
Yeah, keep it pushing.

312
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,455
Get out of here, man.

313
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,251
<i>Bitch-ass nigga.</i>

314
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:51,337
Yo, thanks, Yummy.

315
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:52,546
Ain't nothing.

316
00:11:53,255 --> 00:11:54,423
What's up, J?

317
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,050
Heard you balled out this season.

318
00:11:56,717 --> 00:11:58,677
Hey, you know, trying to do my thing.

319
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,606
Man, Coach already talking about
bumpin' him up to varsity next year.

320
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,808
Word? That's good, man.
Keep putting in work.

321
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,702
<i>You know, that's how you
get to the big leagues,</i>

322
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:07,144
<i>like D-Rose and D-Wade.</i>

323
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:09,033
Y'all need anything though?
Y'all straight?

324
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:11,357
We cool.

325
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:14,015
I got somethin' for y'all, man.

326
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,195
I know how it be, being a little homie.
You know?

327
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,239
I know y'all cool, be cooler.

328
00:12:18,406 --> 00:12:19,824
Ben Frank style.

329
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,159
Gotta keep the little homies fresh,
you feel me?

330
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:23,702
Yo, thanks, Yummy.

331
00:12:23,869 --> 00:12:25,704
Y'all gonna be family soon anyway, right?

332
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,540
- Fo' sho?
- Yeah.

333
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:29,625
There's a lot more where that came from.

334
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,752
- So get used to it.
- All right, Yummy.

335
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:34,046
- I'll holler at you, J.
- All right.

336
00:12:35,381 --> 00:12:36,465
Yo!

337
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:38,443
Girl, keep the change.

338
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,177
- You like it?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

339
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:43,764
Damn, I see you
getting that chop over there, girl.

340
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:44,932
Yes, I am.

341
00:12:45,099 --> 00:12:46,539
How much you charge for them weaves?

342
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,562
Well, it depends.
'Cause if you wanna be basic-ass

343
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:51,730
<i>No, No, No</i> Destiny's Child Beyoncé,

344
00:12:52,148 --> 00:12:53,732
that's gonna cost you, like, $200.

345
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,943
If you wanna be like,
you know, <i>Cater 2 U</i> Beyoncé,

346
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:57,403
that's gonna cost you, like, $600.

347
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,031
And if you wanna be
Beyoncé featuring Jay Z...

348
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,659
- Boom, boom.
- Mmm.

349
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:05,536
That's gonna cost you, like, a stack.

350
00:13:05,744 --> 00:13:08,581
I can't believe y'all
spend all that money on weaves anyway.

351
00:13:09,165 --> 00:13:10,685
Next thing you know, you gonna be just

352
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,794
high-jacking and robbing
Puerto Ricans for their hair.

353
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,524
Eddie, the only hair
getting stolen around here is Indian hair.

354
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,048
It's lush, it's beautiful,

355
00:13:18,215 --> 00:13:20,593
and it's infused with coconut oil
right out the womb, okay?

356
00:13:20,926 --> 00:13:22,178
<i>That's why all y'all want it.</i>

357
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:25,389
Man, I can't believe
y'all put all that money on your heads,

358
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:27,683
and then don't be having
no money for your rent.

359
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:30,102
Excuse you, this is how I pay my rent.

360
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:31,645
Exactly.

361
00:13:31,812 --> 00:13:34,023
'Cause with this hair and this booty,

362
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,025
it's like walking around
with a black AmEx.

363
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,073
And I never get denied.

364
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:39,695
I bet you don't.

365
00:13:39,862 --> 00:13:41,906
Y'all in here complaining
about our weaves,

366
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:43,554
but y'all negroes know good and well

367
00:13:43,657 --> 00:13:46,911
that you'd drop-kick Lupita
to get to Kim Kardashian.

368
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:48,746
- Even the non-negroes.
- Mmm-hmm.

369
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:50,456
Oh, especially the non...

370
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:53,250
Can I say negroes?

371
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:55,002
Carefully, very carefully.

372
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,338
Say it slow so we can
hear all the syllables.

373
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:58,589
Mmm-hmm.

374
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:00,197
Just be remorseful when you say it.

375
00:14:00,257 --> 00:14:02,092
Cool. Negroes.

376
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:05,262
As the only non-negro
in the room, I'd like to say,

377
00:14:05,429 --> 00:14:08,182
Lupita's got a Dark Caesar,
and it's one of my most requested cuts.

378
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,391
<i>Lupita?</i>

379
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:12,394
Man, don't nobody want
no bald head chick in real life.

380
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,606
Even Kanye got rid of Amber
for Kim's sexy ass.

381
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:19,401
Every day, y'all in here complaining
about fake weaves and fake asses,

382
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,321
but all the girls that
you like on Instagram have exactly that.

383
00:14:22,488 --> 00:14:24,490
Fake weaves and fake asses.

384
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,283
- No offense, Draya.
- None taken, girl.

385
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,910
We winning and y'all ain't.

386
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:30,397
I mean, but that's what dudes want,
they want that fantasy.

387
00:14:30,496 --> 00:14:33,457
Yeah, a fantasy that you still expect us
real women to live up to.

388
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,519
What? Men are visual, all right?
What's the problem?

389
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:36,544
Oh, and women aren't?

390
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:39,964
I mean, you don't think we want some nice,
thick, sexy lips to suck on,

391
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,466
and some nice big broad shoulders,

392
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:46,303
and a dick print that
you can see from here to the Sears Tower?

393
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,880
Preach.

394
00:14:48,556 --> 00:14:49,557
Mmm.

395
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:52,476
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Hey! The language!</i>

396
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,566
Watch your mouth in here.
Angie, get your girl.

397
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,313
Oh. Sorry, Mr. Cal.

398
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:59,733
You know what the
whole problem with your generation is?

399
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:02,695
You don't know how to do nothing,
need to learn a skill.

400
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:03,946
Learn how to mop a floor.

401
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:06,156
You know what I'm saying? Iron.

402
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:09,493
Your phone die,
you wouldn't know how to spell a sentence.

403
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,289
Smart phone, dumb girls!

404
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,250
Learn how to cook a decent meal,
for goodness' sake.

405
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:18,752
Look, some of them
don't even know how to microwave.

406
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:20,796
Had a girl come over
to my house last week,

407
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:23,007
went into my kitchen,
thought mine was a safe.

408
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:26,010
I bet that shit was empty.

409
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,511
Ooh.

410
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:29,471
And I can't believe you, Eddie.

411
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:32,141
I can't believe that you
expect your visual fantasy

412
00:15:32,308 --> 00:15:36,020
to actually mop and iron
for your old ass?

413
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:39,523
You come over to my house,
you better know how to clean and iron.

414
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:41,692
Only thing gonna be
wrinkling around my house

415
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:44,945
is my forehead when I say,
"Bitch, what?"

416
00:15:47,156 --> 00:15:48,449
You need manners.

417
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,438
<i>- Yeah, Angie.
- Please!</i>

418
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:55,122
It doesn't matter how much a woman tries
to live up to your fantasies.

419
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:59,710
Doesn't matter if a woman tries to wash
your crusty-ass drawers every night.

420
00:15:59,877 --> 00:16:02,880
Doesn't matter if she
fixes him a special batch of vegan chili,

421
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:05,674
even though chili
is supposed to have meat in it!

422
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,385
<i>Everybody knows that chili has meat in it!</i>

423
00:16:08,552 --> 00:16:10,032
That's what it is, it doesn't matter,

424
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:11,531
because he's still gonna
wake up one morning

425
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:13,557
and leave your ass
for some chick on Instagram!

426
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:17,353
Who had sex with you
and didn't appreciate it?

427
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:19,938
Vegan chili is delicious.

428
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,690
Trust me on this, ladies.

429
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:23,897
The only man that you can
trust is the one up above.

430
00:16:23,942 --> 00:16:24,985
<i>Come on, Bree.</i>

431
00:16:25,194 --> 00:16:26,874
That dude, Ronnie,
he was just a bad apple.

432
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:28,912
<i>If you and your man
had something real,</i>

433
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,909
it wouldn't have mattered
how bad the Instagram ho was.

434
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,036
She wouldn't have
been able to come between y'all.

435
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,246
Not even for Jamaicanthickthighs24?

436
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:37,998
Jerrod.

437
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,848
Ass so fat you can see it from the front.

438
00:16:40,918 --> 00:16:42,294
- Let me see.
- Send me that.

439
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,938
- Yeah, right there.
- Oh, there is a God.

440
00:16:43,962 --> 00:16:45,756
- Smell that.
- It's not scratch-and-sniff.

441
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:47,299
<i>Ass cheeks so separated...</i>

442
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,634
You know what, ladies?

443
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:50,719
For years it has been a war,

444
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:52,429
with the good girls and the hoes,

445
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,431
and the hoes have officially won.

446
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,809
Go, hoes!

447
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,894
Love me some hoes.
I can't live without hoes.

448
00:16:59,103 --> 00:17:00,104
I gotta have them.

449
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,941
Hoes know what to do
and when to do it!

450
00:17:04,108 --> 00:17:05,609
<i>Wait. Wait. Hold up!</i>

451
00:17:05,818 --> 00:17:08,987
You girls keep complaining
about the chauvinistic talk in the shop,

452
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,281
but y'all do the same thing in reverse.

453
00:17:11,573 --> 00:17:13,742
Each one of y'all want a super thug

454
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,620
that can hold his own
on the yard at the Cook County jail,

455
00:17:16,787 --> 00:17:19,707
that's got three degrees from
Harvard and making six figures.

456
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,874
You know it.

457
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,502
Meanwhile, you pass up
corny dudes like Jerrod every day.

458
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,254
<i>Mmm. Exactly.</i>

459
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:29,216
Don't no woman want no moist
Duncan Hines-ass dude like Jerrod.

460
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,052
- No.
- Jerrod's like boiled okra.

461
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,887
He's just green, stringy,

462
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,432
just completely unappetizing
to the human palate.

463
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,808
<i>Wow.</i>

464
00:17:37,975 --> 00:17:39,577
Such kind words, you guys.
I really appreciate it.

465
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,686
<i>Uh. A couple things.</i>

466
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:43,313
First of all, I'm standing right here.
I can hear you.

467
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,690
And second of all--

468
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:45,941
Baller alert!

469
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,961
<i>No, he did not just pull up
in a Maserati, girl!</i>

470
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,987
<i>Is that L. Rock from the Bears?
Oh, my God.</i>

471
00:17:50,154 --> 00:17:52,531
<i>He just got a $47 million contract.</i>

472
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,784
Thirty-five guaranteed
and four with incentives.

473
00:17:57,828 --> 00:17:59,764
Craig came by here 20 minutes ago
looking for you.

474
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,108
Okay, thanks, Cal. I'll text him.

475
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:02,166
Hey, babe.

476
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:04,227
I need you to pick up Maya
from school today, too.

477
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:06,938
I just squeezed in another
last-minute appointment and I can't do it.

478
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:07,963
Yeah, I see.

479
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:09,506
Come on, babe, please.

480
00:18:09,673 --> 00:18:11,300
I got an appointment, too.

481
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,218
- Can't Kenny do it?
- I asked Kenny.

482
00:18:13,385 --> 00:18:15,225
He said he was too busy,
which is really funny,

483
00:18:15,304 --> 00:18:17,323
because I don't know
what a 15-year-old could be busy doing

484
00:18:17,347 --> 00:18:20,350
other than drinking up all my goddamn
apple juice and dirtying up the house.

485
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,269
Oh, that's easy, they masturbate a lot.

486
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:23,604
<i>What? They do.</i>

487
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:25,355
I mean, I was 15.

488
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,816
I was 15 this morning. Am I right, Raja?

489
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:31,111
Don't touch me with that hand.
Don't touch me in general.

490
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,905
Come here, let me get your beard.

491
00:18:33,447 --> 00:18:34,698
<i>That's all? Whoa. Really?</i>

492
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:37,868
So you playing celebrity barber
and I'm Mr. Mom now?

493
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:40,722
You're the one who said you wanted to
spend more time with Maya and Kenny,

494
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:42,140
- so what's the problem?
- Some time.

495
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:43,832
Half your clients was mine to start.

496
00:18:43,999 --> 00:18:45,239
<i>Oh, you complaining now?</i>

497
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:48,229
When Kenny's mom asked if he can spend
the remainder of high school with us,

498
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:49,254
I was cool with it.

499
00:18:49,421 --> 00:18:51,524
But since he's been with us,
he's done nothing to help out.

500
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:52,549
Yeah, come on.

501
00:18:52,716 --> 00:18:53,943
It's like we have
two toddlers in the house.

502
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:55,967
- It's a new situation.
- It's not a new situation.

503
00:18:56,053 --> 00:18:57,864
It's been a year!
You're being too soft on him!

504
00:18:57,888 --> 00:18:59,032
You know how long he was with his mother.

505
00:18:59,056 --> 00:19:00,867
<i>- I understand that.
- All right, y'all.</i>

506
00:19:00,891 --> 00:19:02,971
Yo, Terri and Rashad! Yo!

507
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:05,038
Do y'all need a minute?
Because we'll all leave.

508
00:19:05,062 --> 00:19:06,772
You know what? I'm gonna leave.

509
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:09,107
It's like <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> reunion in here.

510
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,359
<i>Momma Dee and Lil Scrappy.</i>

511
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:12,402
Terri, girl, I couldn't help but overhear.

512
00:19:12,569 --> 00:19:14,446
I mean, girl, everybody could hear.

513
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:16,865
But I wanted to tell you,
and I told Rashad,

514
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:20,285
I could pick up Maya, like,
whenever you need me to.

515
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,246
So let me know if I can help out, girl.

516
00:19:22,496 --> 00:19:24,790
In any... In any way.

517
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:27,393
<i>I don't need nothing
but for you to back up a few feet.</i>

518
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:29,753
This is a private discussion
between me and my husband.

519
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,272
I mean, I didn't realize
it was so private

520
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:33,096
'cause, like I said,
everybody can hear y'all.

521
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,175
But y'all been a little bit overwhelmed,

522
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:38,428
and let me release some of that stress.

523
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,266
Why don't you help yourself
back to your station, Draya?

524
00:19:42,432 --> 00:19:44,893
Look, Terri. I got you.
I got you, baby. Come here.

525
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,311
My bad, girl.

526
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:48,118
Don't even get riled up like that, Terri.

527
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,749
- It's all good.
- Stay in your lane.

528
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:51,942
Come on. Baby, come here, I got you.

529
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,236
I'll go get Maya,
you do what you gotta do.

530
00:19:54,403 --> 00:19:55,643
I know we need the money, so...

531
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:56,905
Thank you.

532
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,825
Well, you know, when I get home later,

533
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,785
I'll make it up to you.

534
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:03,287
I'll do that thing you like.

535
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:04,872
Yeah, okay.

536
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,999
Sure you gonna be burnt out by tonight.

537
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:11,211
It's all right, though. I'll wait for
the morning for that lazy side booty.

538
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,676
Terri, just out of curiosity,
what is that thing that you do?

539
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,203
Is it something that I can Google?

540
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:21,471
<i>Yo, Calvin, what's the Wi-Fi password?</i>

541
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,474
Let me get that Lupita.

542
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:28,562
Excellent choice.

543
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:30,631
<i>You wanna act grown?</i>

544
00:20:30,731 --> 00:20:32,524
Well, now you got a grown-man haircut.

545
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,736
- Yeah, this gotta be some of my best work.
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

546
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,909
- Your friends at school gonna love this.
- Oh!

547
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,661
That's the information
super highway right there.

548
00:20:44,828 --> 00:20:46,163
Let's go.

549
00:20:46,371 --> 00:20:48,248
So you learned your
lesson today, didn't you?

550
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:51,168
You look good, man!
Nothin' can stop you now.

551
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,837
Tell Weezy I said "hey!"

552
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,255
Eddie...

553
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,715
Tell me that ain't child abuse.

554
00:20:56,882 --> 00:20:59,843
I bet you he won't
be talking back to his mama no more.

555
00:21:00,093 --> 00:21:02,512
Gave him the George Jefferson.

556
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,099
<i>All right, looking good.</i>

557
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,226
Hi. Who are you here to see?

558
00:21:08,644 --> 00:21:09,884
Yeah, I'm here to see One-Stop.

559
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:11,438
Take a number.

560
00:21:12,147 --> 00:21:13,649
They all here to see One-Stop.

561
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,859
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

562
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,195
Right, right.

563
00:21:19,154 --> 00:21:20,906
That's what I said.

564
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:22,199
Give me a minute, brother.

565
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:25,118
I need eight 32-inch TVs. No plasma, man.

566
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:26,925
Just LCDs, brother. You know what I mean?

567
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,747
<i>I got the watches, I got the rings.</i>

568
00:21:28,914 --> 00:21:29,915
I'm doing tailoring,

569
00:21:30,082 --> 00:21:31,476
I'm doing a little bit
of everything now, brother.

570
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,644
<i>Right, right, right, right.</i>

571
00:21:32,668 --> 00:21:33,853
No, I just do the measurements.

572
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,957
I got a little Asian lady
who puts the suit together.

573
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:37,381
<i>She sews. I don't sew.</i>

574
00:21:39,091 --> 00:21:42,469
Calvin, you really just gonna
let this fool come slidin' up in here

575
00:21:42,678 --> 00:21:44,262
<i>like he run the place?</i>

576
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:46,556
Eddie, worry about your section.

577
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,893
<i>Pardon me.</i>

578
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,937
Look here, Truck Stop, One-Stop.

579
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,064
Come here, son. This the barber shop.

580
00:21:54,231 --> 00:21:57,025
You gotta get people in and out.
That's what we do.

581
00:21:57,317 --> 00:21:59,820
You got these musty negroes
sitting around here all day,

582
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,405
like it's an unemployment office.

583
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:04,574
Hey, Eddie, man, look. I pay booth rent
like everybody else does in here.

584
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,742
Besides,

585
00:22:05,909 --> 00:22:08,412
barbers don't provide the full
menu of services that I do.

586
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:10,622
Off-market medicinal remedies,

587
00:22:10,789 --> 00:22:12,624
alternative documentation,

588
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,751
little emotional service doggies

589
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:17,063
that lick your face
and make you feel good about yourself.

590
00:22:17,087 --> 00:22:18,898
And they tinkle all over your shirt.

591
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:21,550
They so happy to see you.
And it makes you feel good inside.

592
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,719
I've been around a long time here, son.

593
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:26,888
And what all you do is sell fake ID,

594
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,307
nickel bags of weed,
and pit bull puppies.

595
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,786
Talking about a little puppy
gonna lick on somebody's face.

596
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,020
It sounds too freaky for me.

597
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,626
I don't want no puppy licking on me.

598
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,565
It's just not at all African-American.

599
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:38,525
Sounds very, very Caucasian.

600
00:22:39,109 --> 00:22:41,319
Calvin, you really gonna
let him be up in the shop?

601
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:43,206
Like, I can't believe
he let you up in here.

602
00:22:44,364 --> 00:22:46,324
Calvin, my man. You're my man, right?

603
00:22:46,658 --> 00:22:49,286
Please tell this man, this ancient being,

604
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:50,746
this old fogey,

605
00:22:50,912 --> 00:22:52,456
this dinosaur of some sorts.

606
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:53,623
Oh, keep them coming.

607
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:56,126
This negro-saurus of a man
walking around here giving us

608
00:22:56,293 --> 00:22:58,879
the damn trailer to <i>Jurassic Park,</i>
every time we walk up in here.

609
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,900
Okay, that was a good one right there.

610
00:23:02,382 --> 00:23:05,594
Please tell this
<i>50 Shades of Grey-</i>looking ass,

611
00:23:05,761 --> 00:23:07,971
am I or am I not

612
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,432
a intricate part of this damn shop?

613
00:23:11,266 --> 00:23:12,309
He got a point, Eddie.

614
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,019
He got...

615
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,938
Uh-oh. Uh-oh.

616
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,525
You know what? That's it for me.

617
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,092
Hey. But this ain't no free clinic.

618
00:23:22,152 --> 00:23:25,072
I understand. And I did stop doing
the VD screenings last week.

619
00:23:25,322 --> 00:23:27,824
It's done, okay? It's over.

620
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,606
What can I do for you, brother?

621
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,328
Uh. I got a itch

622
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:32,746
down there.

623
00:23:32,996 --> 00:23:34,122
<i>It's a itch that burns.</i>

624
00:23:34,289 --> 00:23:36,666
Come over here. This is the last one.

625
00:23:36,917 --> 00:23:38,557
<i>This boy burning bad,
I smell it. Come on.</i>

626
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,629
- Hey, everybody!
<i>- Hey, girl.</i>

627
00:23:40,796 --> 00:23:42,506
Rashad, I got your sheen spray for you.

628
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:43,757
<i>Appreciate that.</i>

629
00:23:43,924 --> 00:23:46,635
Angie, this conditioner
should last you for the next two weeks.

630
00:23:46,802 --> 00:23:48,011
<i>Thank you, baby!</i>

631
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:49,947
Can you help me put
these away in the back?

632
00:23:49,971 --> 00:23:52,516
<i>Hey, who's winning
over here, now? What's goin' on?</i>

633
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,353
By a show of hands, who got a itch?

634
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,854
Who got a burn?

635
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,147
Damn.

636
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:02,025
<i>So, did you hear
Mr. Harris got shot?</i>

637
00:24:02,234 --> 00:24:03,652
- What?
- Mmm-hmm.

638
00:24:04,152 --> 00:24:07,114
Are you serious? Is he okay?

639
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,951
I mean, he got shot, so he's not great.

640
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,119
But he's gonna make it.

641
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,370
Oh, no.

642
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:16,581
I was just in there last week
talking to his wife.

643
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,877
Man. She was so excited
they was getting a second location.

644
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:22,838
Was she with him?

645
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,381
No, thank God.

646
00:24:24,548 --> 00:24:26,901
You know, he was in there by himself
closing up for the night.

647
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:29,511
Wouldn't open up the register,
so they shot him.

648
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:32,305
I don't know what's
happening out there, Calvin.

649
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:34,307
These kids have lost their damn minds.

650
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:36,893
Meanwhile, we gotta
raise Jalen in this mess.

651
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,895
It's not cool.

652
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,607
We gotta revisit that conversation.

653
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:45,068
What conversation?

654
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:47,445
About moving the shop.

655
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,408
You know, One-Stop found some cool
locations over there on the North Side.

656
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:54,494
Does One-Stop even know what escrow means?

657
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:56,413
You'd be surprised what One-Stop know.

658
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,707
And have you discussed it with Angie?

659
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:02,252
You can't make a decision about the shop
without at least talking to her first.

660
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,273
I wanted to talk to you first because you
know what you're gonna tell me?

661
00:25:05,297 --> 00:25:06,816
"Why did you talk to her first?"

662
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,258
I do not sound like that.

663
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:12,888
I don't know, Calvin.

664
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:15,599
Uprooting the shop is a big decision.

665
00:25:16,391 --> 00:25:17,976
You don't think I know that?

666
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,145
But what else we supposed to do?

667
00:25:20,312 --> 00:25:22,152
Just sit here and wait
for somethin' to happen?

668
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,359
We gotta explore all of our options.

669
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:29,738
Yeah.

670
00:25:37,537 --> 00:25:38,657
<i>I ain't got no money.</i>

671
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:39,745
<i>Let me talk to you.</i>

672
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,042
<i>- No, I'm good.
- Come on, baby.</i>

673
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:43,352
<i>Let's holler at you for a little bit.</i>

674
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:44,520
<i>You hollerin' right now,</i>

675
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:45,629
<i>I can hear you. I'm good.</i>

676
00:25:45,795 --> 00:25:46,880
<i>Yo, who that?</i>

677
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,298
<i>Hey, what up, J.D.?</i>

678
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,466
Oh, hey!

679
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:51,843
Hey, I got that tater salad for your mama!

680
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,330
- Come get it!
<i>- All right.</i>

681
00:25:54,638 --> 00:25:56,139
What's going on, hungry black folks?

682
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:58,850
Huh? Who wants some
non-profit Gangsta Grub?

683
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:02,020
All right. Soul food to save fools' souls.

684
00:26:02,187 --> 00:26:05,065
Every delicious piece of beef
helps keep a bullet off the street.

685
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,210
I know that's right because
that "Who Smoked Your Okra"

686
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:08,652
was poppin' on fleek last time.

687
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:09,903
There you go, Draya.

688
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,613
Did she just say "fleek"?

689
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,323
<i>Don't... Don't just make up words.</i>

690
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,784
There's a whole dictionary full of words.

691
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:17,494
<i>There's a library down the street.</i>

692
00:26:17,702 --> 00:26:19,996
Webster's Dictionary.
Go in there and flip through it.

693
00:26:20,163 --> 00:26:22,290
You won't see "fleek" in there, nowhere.

694
00:26:22,457 --> 00:26:24,060
Draya, don't worry about that. I got some

695
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:25,978
"Don't Be So Mean" greens
in there for you today, too.

696
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:27,146
<i>- You gonna love it.</i>
- Thank you, boo-boo.

697
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:31,132
They so good, they're gonna make
a Vice Lord give a GD a foot massage.

698
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,218
<i>Nigga!</i>

699
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,844
Oh!

700
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,973
You are like
the Al Sharpton of the fat back.

701
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:39,140
Okay. Okay.

702
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,660
When are you gonna get
your own show on VH1?

703
00:26:40,684 --> 00:26:42,185
Who knows, man? You know, right now,

704
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:44,121
I'm just happy
being a pillar of the community,

705
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,265
<i>trying to do something good.</i>

706
00:26:45,355 --> 00:26:49,359
I mean, so, you want us to believe
that you cooked all that food yourself?

707
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:52,237
My kitchen workforce is
made up of ex-gangbangers,

708
00:26:52,404 --> 00:26:55,532
who, if they didn't have this job,
would be on the street bangin'.

709
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,020
And you donating all the profit?

710
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,702
What's so hard to believe about that?

711
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,331
What is it, Eddie? What is it?

712
00:27:03,498 --> 00:27:05,138
Rashad, you might have
to shut your mouth.

713
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,252
This pie got me dancing a jig over here.

714
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,504
- Mmm-hmm.
- Don't be no sucker, Eddie.

715
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:10,672
Oh!

716
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:11,840
What's that, Rashad?

717
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,050
I got the little peanut butter
and poverty sandwich.

718
00:27:14,259 --> 00:27:17,053
Did Terri cut the edges off the bread
like she does for the baby, too?

719
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:21,182
Yo, J.D., man. This is on the up and up.

720
00:27:21,391 --> 00:27:23,035
- I'm proud of you, bro.
- Oh, thanks, Calvin.

721
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,394
- But the name...
- What?

722
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:25,812
I'm a little concerned, man.

723
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:27,290
The name seems like
you're promoting something.

724
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:28,732
Man, I'm just promoting food.

725
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:31,609
Remember the words
of Maya Angelou, man. "Words is power."

726
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:32,861
Maya Ange-who?

727
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:35,989
I know who you're talking about.

728
00:27:36,156 --> 00:27:38,076
That big booty bitch
we went to high school with,

729
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,826
with the lopsided titties, I remember.

730
00:27:39,993 --> 00:27:42,033
Calvin, come on, man.
You know I'm just joking, man.

731
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,872
You know I know who Maya Angelou is.

732
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,415
"Still I rise."

733
00:27:45,582 --> 00:27:47,250
<i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.</i>

734
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:50,295
Who is this on the cover?
It looks like Mike Tyson.

735
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,271
<i>Gonna be a double-breasted suit.</i>

736
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:58,803
Can't win for losing.

737
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,351
Well, there he goes!
Harold Washington, Junior.

738
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,371
- What up, Jimmy?
- What's up, man?

739
00:28:07,395 --> 00:28:08,956
- You're lookin' good.
- Good to see you.

740
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,249
You know, you're the only
one that comes in here

741
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:11,913
with a suit on that ain't goin' to court.

742
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:17,280
Everybody ain't tryin' to wear one of
them granny sofa suits you got.

743
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:18,740
- Guess who's back?
- Hey, Jimmy.

744
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:19,949
What up, bro?

745
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,761
<i>What bring you around here?</i>

746
00:28:21,785 --> 00:28:24,245
I know you didn't come
all the way over here to the South Side

747
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:25,413
just for a line up.

748
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,207
Yeah. Where's your camera crew, Jimmy?

749
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:28,851
Doing a little press opp
for the mayor's office?

750
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,437
What, a man can't check out his old
stomping grounds on his lunch break?

751
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:32,462
- Hell, nah.
- No.

752
00:28:32,629 --> 00:28:34,297
- No.
- Hell, no.

753
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:35,965
All right, you got me.

754
00:28:36,132 --> 00:28:39,111
I do want to talk to you all about this
council vote that's coming up next week.

755
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,136
What vote?

756
00:28:40,303 --> 00:28:41,423
The one about the enclosure.

757
00:28:41,513 --> 00:28:42,639
- Closure?
- What enclosure?

758
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,848
What kind of enclosure?

759
00:28:44,015 --> 00:28:45,683
The city plans to gate off 20 blocks,

760
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,828
with this shop essentially
right in the middle of it.

761
00:28:47,852 --> 00:28:49,705
See, the idea is that
if it can control traffic,

762
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,106
you know, one way in, one way out,

763
00:28:51,272 --> 00:28:52,958
<i>it'll help decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

764
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:55,276
So they're just gonna
build a jail around us?

765
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:57,671
Do you know what cuttin' off these
streets is gonna do to traffic?

766
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,322
You're right. It might increase traffic.

767
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:01,175
<i>But it might also decrease
violence in the neighborhood,</i>

768
00:29:01,199 --> 00:29:02,760
which would make
this shop more desirable.

769
00:29:02,784 --> 00:29:03,785
That ain't gonna help us.

770
00:29:04,202 --> 00:29:06,496
<i>We'll just be a non-violent empty shop.</i>

771
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:10,166
Exactly. And half the businesses on
this block are barely above water.

772
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:11,418
- Exactly.
- Look, y'all.

773
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:12,895
I know it's not the most ideal solution.

774
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:13,920
But you gotta acknowledge

775
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:15,272
that at least we're trying
to do something.

776
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:16,673
- No.
- Yeah. No.

777
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,841
Hell, no.

778
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,443
<i>Look, y'all, I share the same concerns,</i>

779
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:20,861
but something's gotta be done out here.

780
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:23,322
Do you know how many people get shot on
this block, every single week?

781
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,389
Do you?

782
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,058
'Cause we out here
dodging bullets every day,

783
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:29,105
while you downtown talkin'
about the South Side,

784
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:32,897
look like some Middle Eastern,
war-torn country in your $1,000 suit.

785
00:29:33,148 --> 00:29:35,817
You know damn well
them suits ain't $1,000, boyba.

786
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,944
Look, Rashad, we want the same thing, man.

787
00:29:38,111 --> 00:29:40,780
But the council, they're all out of
ideas just like everybody else.

788
00:29:40,947 --> 00:29:42,031
That's right. Put it on us.

789
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:43,809
<i>That's what politicians do though.</i>

790
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,177
<i>You know, they don't do their job--</i>

791
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:46,345
All I'm doing is workin', brother.

792
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,555
<i>...but then they want us to do it.</i>

793
00:29:47,579 --> 00:29:48,931
And then you say it's our fault, right?

794
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,555
Like, we the ones that don't wanna work.

795
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:51,916
- Exactly.
<i>- I told you.</i>

796
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,501
I mentioned this a long time ago.

797
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:57,380
Government ain't good for nothing
but giving you syphilis and flu shots.

798
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,133
I'm almost sure that's how I got syphilis.

799
00:30:01,009 --> 00:30:02,969
That is not how you got syphilis.

800
00:30:03,386 --> 00:30:05,847
Her name was Josephine.

801
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:08,308
Would you stop
tellin' everybody's business!

802
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,561
That's funny.
My mom's name is Josephine.

803
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:12,770
Ah...

804
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:15,315
Wait. What...

805
00:30:17,442 --> 00:30:19,522
You know, maybe
that's part of the problem. I mean...

806
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,505
Maybe we need to
stop waiting for the government

807
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:23,929
to step in and save us
and we need to start saving ourselves.

808
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,366
<i>I mean, this is America.</i>

809
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,577
Everybody has equal
opportunity to make it here.

810
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:28,745
Really?

811
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:29,913
- What?
- Okay.

812
00:30:30,121 --> 00:30:31,122
- Oh, man.
<i>- Oh...</i>

813
00:30:31,289 --> 00:30:34,042
All right. Baba ghanoush
over here lost his damn mind.

814
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,418
Eddie, that's bullshit.

815
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:36,905
You wanna know why I'm sarcastic?

816
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:38,355
Because every time I open my mouth

817
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,259
to say something real,
you gotta make fun of me.

818
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,985
Meanwhile, if I say you're
a watermelon-flavored fried chicken lover,

819
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:44,010
I'm a racist.

820
00:30:44,302 --> 00:30:45,303
<i>Hell, nah.</i>

821
00:30:45,637 --> 00:30:46,971
You'll get your ass beat.

822
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:48,598
Rashad, it was hypothetical.

823
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,993
There's no such thing
as watermelon-flavored fried chicken.

824
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:52,435
Not yet, Raja.

825
00:30:53,478 --> 00:30:55,271
That would be stereotypically delicious.

826
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:58,441
All I'm saying is, my parents
moved here from India with nothing.

827
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:00,318
<i>They had no money, no friends.</i>

828
00:31:00,485 --> 00:31:01,765
And their accents were so thick,

829
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,383
they couldn't even get bank accounts.

830
00:31:03,446 --> 00:31:04,590
And somehow they made it happen.

831
00:31:04,614 --> 00:31:06,783
Not to dismiss your argument here, Raja,

832
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,826
because it is... It is riveting.

833
00:31:08,993 --> 00:31:11,788
However, there were
some "setbacks" that black people faced

834
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:14,035
that really made things
stressful for a minute there.

835
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:16,543
Slavery being at
the very top of that list.

836
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:18,628
Exactly. Your ancestors were immigrants.

837
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:19,796
Ours were imports.

838
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:21,403
- Big difference.
<i>- Not really.</i>

839
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:23,344
How do you think
the West Indies happened, okay?

840
00:31:23,508 --> 00:31:25,885
They took Indians,
they took black people from Africa,

841
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:27,238
they put 'em in the Caribbean,

842
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:30,139
and 200 years later, Rihanna happened.
You're welcome.

843
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:33,643
I don't like white people either. Okay?

844
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,970
I'm just saying, maybe y'all
should stop making excuses

845
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,304
and actually pick up the ball.

846
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:38,475
- Whoa!
- "Pick up the ball"?

847
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,125
- Basketball reference.
- That was racist, right there.

848
00:31:40,149 --> 00:31:41,150
"Pick up the ball"?

849
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,318
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

850
00:31:42,485 --> 00:31:44,737
It got real Fox News-y in here for me.

851
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,740
Well, yeah,
we do be shootin' some hoop.

852
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:49,343
<i>What are you talkin' about, man?</i>

853
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:51,167
You think it's
a level playing field out here?

854
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:53,121
You think racism don't exist no more?

855
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:55,832
The President of
the United States of America is black.

856
00:31:55,999 --> 00:31:58,501
The most powerful man
on the planet is black.

857
00:31:58,668 --> 00:31:59,669
Just one man.

858
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:02,964
Meanwhile, only dude I have to look up to
is the guy from <i>Big Bang Theory.</i>

859
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:05,383
He funny. He make me laugh.

860
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,928
So what does that mean for the average
black dude walking down the street?

861
00:32:09,512 --> 00:32:10,739
Does our president's blackness,

862
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:14,142
did it stop Trayvon Martin,
or Michael Brown,

863
00:32:14,809 --> 00:32:17,937
or Walter Scott, or Tamir Rice,
or Freddie Gray from being killed?

864
00:32:18,104 --> 00:32:19,105
Hell nah.

865
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:23,985
A madman walked into a Charleston church
and killed nine innocent people.

866
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:26,446
<i>Did his blackness stop that?</i>

867
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:30,992
Eric Garner got killed on tape
and it still didn't matter.

868
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,203
So what are you saying, Raja?

869
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,819
I'm not sayin' that stuff isn't messed up.
Because it is.

870
00:32:36,914 --> 00:32:38,124
What I'm saying is,

871
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:40,168
there's never been a better time

872
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:43,254
in this country
to be a black person than right now.

873
00:32:43,588 --> 00:32:44,881
Unless you Bill Cosby.

874
00:32:45,048 --> 00:32:46,168
Uh...

875
00:32:48,343 --> 00:32:49,927
I'm not doin' this school work.

876
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:52,531
If she thinks I'm really about
to do this homework tonight...

877
00:32:52,555 --> 00:32:54,265
She gave us six packets.

878
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:55,642
Six packets.

879
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,019
Man, she must be insane.

880
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:02,482
<i>Yo, there go those dudes
from this morning.</i>

881
00:33:18,998 --> 00:33:20,998
<i>I used to cut
Barack's hair back in the day.</i>

882
00:33:21,084 --> 00:33:23,753
Hell, I'm the one who told
him to marry Michelle.

883
00:33:24,212 --> 00:33:25,814
<i>- Oh!
- He liked some other little girl.</i>

884
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:26,881
<i>He was gonna tell her--</i>

885
00:33:27,048 --> 00:33:29,008
Thelma Carter. With the big tongue.

886
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:31,464
Couldn't say his name.
She used to call him "Barath."

887
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:36,265
Michelle, now, that's different.
She got them childbearing hips.

888
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:37,850
<i>And she can iron a shirt.</i>

889
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:40,937
You see them arms right there?

890
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:44,158
You never touched
a hair on that man's head.

891
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,983
- Not one.
- Are you serious?

892
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:47,777
Hold on. Okay. All right. Okay.

893
00:33:47,985 --> 00:33:50,465
Who do you think that is?
It's him before his hair turned gray.

894
00:33:50,738 --> 00:33:51,948
Oh, that could be anybody.

895
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:53,866
Man, you can't tell who that is, man.

896
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:56,494
It's Barack right there.
You can tell by the ear.

897
00:33:56,661 --> 00:33:58,621
You cannot.

898
00:33:58,955 --> 00:34:00,289
You can't see shit.

899
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,042
You're stupid.

900
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:05,211
You know what? Forget y'all.

901
00:34:05,378 --> 00:34:06,522
<i>Laugh all you want to.</i>

902
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,257
Y'all better just leave Barack alone.
He's one of ours.

903
00:34:09,465 --> 00:34:11,134
He used to be one of ours.

904
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:15,805
I mean, when was the last time you seen
Barack Obama do something for us?

905
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,141
And I'm not talkin'
about for the country.

906
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,642
I'm talkin' about for us.

907
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:21,728
Eddie, even if you don't agree,

908
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,774
you still gotta honor
what she's sayin', though.

909
00:34:24,147 --> 00:34:25,857
Thank you, Rashad.

910
00:34:26,065 --> 00:34:28,568
- I can't take this anymore, man. I'm out.
- All right.

911
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:30,381
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Thank you, man.

912
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:32,321
And you need to read a newspaper.

913
00:34:32,488 --> 00:34:34,633
Obama makes sure you
get all that birth control that you need.

914
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:35,908
Excuse me?

915
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,203
And the rest of y'all,
council vote next week. Don't forget.

916
00:34:39,370 --> 00:34:42,457
<i>Look, I can't let y'all tear
the President down like that. All right.</i>

917
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:45,835
The man is in an impossible situation.
Know what I'm sayin'?

918
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:47,202
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

919
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:49,589
He's not just the president
of black America.

920
00:34:49,797 --> 00:34:52,008
He's the President of
the United States of America.

921
00:34:52,383 --> 00:34:55,052
And personally,
I think he's doin' a great job.

922
00:34:55,595 --> 00:34:59,015
You know what? The two of them just make
me believe in the sanctity of marriage.

923
00:34:59,265 --> 00:35:01,809
I hate to be
the one to say this...

924
00:35:03,311 --> 00:35:04,896
But Barack has definitely got bitches.

925
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,522
Oh, yeah, he does.

926
00:35:06,689 --> 00:35:08,041
No, he has not.

927
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:11,065
Half these hoes weren't even registered
to vote before he ran for president.

928
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:12,195
<i>Give me a break!</i>

929
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:16,324
Every vote... Ass. Ass, ass, ass.
That's what it is.

930
00:35:16,616 --> 00:35:19,243
Oh... You know what?
I hate to agree with Dante,

931
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:21,329
'cause it's just a bad look.

932
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,040
But every president has a side chick.

933
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:25,583
<i>It's constitutional.</i>

934
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,378
You know, Thomas Jefferson
had a whole plantation of side chicks.

935
00:35:29,796 --> 00:35:31,881
I bet you Hillary's got a side chick.

936
00:35:32,131 --> 00:35:33,591
Probably thick, too.

937
00:35:38,012 --> 00:35:39,722
- What's up, Terri?
- What up, Quis?

938
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,647
Looks like you're on
the wrong side of town, nigga.

939
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,776
Boy, this whole city is mine.
These are my blocks.

940
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,546
And I don't see nobody out there
strong enough to take it from me.

941
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,571
Shit.

942
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:56,781
So what are you sayin'?

943
00:35:56,948 --> 00:35:58,091
You tryin' to embarrass yourself

944
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:59,384
- and get blood on the floor.
- Embarrass myself?

945
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,552
No! Wait a minute! Wait, wait, wait.

946
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:01,616
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

947
00:36:01,744 --> 00:36:02,784
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

948
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:03,996
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

949
00:36:04,163 --> 00:36:05,581
Listen! Wait! Listen!

950
00:36:05,748 --> 00:36:07,083
Listen a minute! No! No! Look...

951
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,417
I'll blow your head off, man.

952
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:09,752
<i>Look, not in here!</i>

953
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:12,022
Y'all wanna kill each other,
y'all take that shit outside!

954
00:36:12,046 --> 00:36:13,047
Well, let's go outside!

955
00:36:13,256 --> 00:36:14,336
Calvin, what he doing here?

956
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:15,675
I booked him. I booked him.

957
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:17,903
He has a standing appointment
with me every other week.

958
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:19,404
It got messed up when he went to jail

959
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,739
and I didn't know Quis
was gonna be here today.

960
00:36:20,763 --> 00:36:21,764
I'm sorry, y'all.

961
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,171
- Stupid nigga!
- Jay! Jay! Jay!

962
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,624
- That's what I'm doing here!
- Jay!

963
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:25,869
- Jay! Look at me.
- What you gonna do?

964
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:27,186
Look at me, Jay!

965
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:29,063
Come back in an hour.

966
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,273
Come back in an hour.

967
00:36:30,523 --> 00:36:31,524
<i>Please.</i>

968
00:36:31,691 --> 00:36:32,692
<i>Please.</i>

969
00:36:32,984 --> 00:36:34,360
I'll take care of your bill.

970
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:35,820
On me.

971
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:39,740
I'll pay for everything,
I'll pay for your hair, man.

972
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:42,952
That's cool, Calvin.

973
00:36:44,954 --> 00:36:46,831
All right. Thank you!

974
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:48,457
- You know me, boy.
- Thank you, man!

975
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,625
You a stupid nigga.

976
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,103
<i>- Come on, man.
- I'm telling you!</i>

977
00:36:51,127 --> 00:36:52,295
You know what it is.

978
00:36:52,461 --> 00:36:53,901
<i>In an hour, man. In an hour.</i>

979
00:36:56,299 --> 00:36:57,592
I'm sorry.

980
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,331
- Thanks, Shad.
- It's all right.

981
00:37:00,386 --> 00:37:03,055
Big boy, I'm sorry about that, man.
Misunderstanding.

982
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:08,102
We usually have that schedule
worked out a little better.

983
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:09,937
It's all good, Calvin.

984
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,794
You know, I'm gonna have to
get that thing from you.

985
00:37:15,818 --> 00:37:16,819
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

986
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:24,952
The other one, too.

987
00:37:25,828 --> 00:37:27,914
Oh man, I forgot about that one.

988
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:31,709
Damn shame.

989
00:37:33,044 --> 00:37:34,754
<i>Can't even go to the barbershop no more</i>

990
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:37,840
<i>without some knucklehead
bringin' a gun in here.</i>

991
00:37:38,382 --> 00:37:40,718
Barbershop used to be a place of peace.

992
00:37:41,177 --> 00:37:42,678
It's for my protection.

993
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,181
From what? Some clippers?

994
00:37:45,681 --> 00:37:48,517
What the hell you
need to be bringing that in here for?

995
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:50,353
It's my constitutional right.

996
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:51,520
Nigga, spell it.

997
00:37:52,897 --> 00:37:54,982
Constitutional right!

998
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:58,411
You need to worry about why ain't nobody
ever sitting in them chairs.

999
00:37:58,527 --> 00:37:59,862
You probably shot them all.

1000
00:38:02,573 --> 00:38:03,616
Yeah, this Calvin.

1001
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,576
It might be a better question for you.

1002
00:38:05,743 --> 00:38:07,161
- Crazy. Crazy.
- Is he okay?

1003
00:38:07,370 --> 00:38:08,621
Wait. Is he okay?

1004
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:10,515
<i>Man. Come on, man.
We all lived out here...</i>

1005
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,582
No, I'll be on my way.

1006
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,764
I'll be there.
Rashad, handle that for me.

1007
00:38:13,876 --> 00:38:14,877
Yo, Cal, what's up?

1008
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:16,253
I got you, no worries.

1009
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,589
No! Hell, no, man! He said Rashad.

1010
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:19,942
No, I don't think he said Rashad.

1011
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:20,967
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

1012
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,468
Yeah. He said me, Eddie.

1013
00:38:22,635 --> 00:38:23,886
Specifically?

1014
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:25,846
He called you by name?

1015
00:38:35,564 --> 00:38:38,567
Baby, are you okay? Did anybody hit you?

1016
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,146
<i>No, nothing happened.</i>

1017
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,838
<i>I was just standing there
and a fight broke out.</i>

1018
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,006
Oh, don't worry. We're gonna get this

1019
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,383
- all straightened out.
- Mom! I'm fine.

1020
00:38:44,407 --> 00:38:46,127
- Let me see your head.
<i>- No, Mom, I'm okay.</i>

1021
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:48,411
My God. It's, like, red right here.

1022
00:38:48,661 --> 00:38:49,662
Goodness.

1023
00:38:50,246 --> 00:38:51,789
Let me see your face.

1024
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,087
<i>So, what happened?</i>

1025
00:38:58,421 --> 00:39:00,047
Well, frankly, Mr. Palmer,

1026
00:39:00,214 --> 00:39:03,294
we're concerned about the people that
Jalen's been hanging around with lately.

1027
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:04,593
Are you talking about Kenny?

1028
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:06,679
Why would you say that?

1029
00:39:06,929 --> 00:39:08,931
'Cause that's who
he's been hanging with every day.

1030
00:39:09,432 --> 00:39:11,642
You guys know I can't talk
about anybody else's kids.

1031
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:13,019
But let me just say this.

1032
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:15,855
Jalen has shifted
over these past few weeks.

1033
00:39:16,022 --> 00:39:17,148
His behavior is different.

1034
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:18,733
<i>His teachers have noticed it.</i>

1035
00:39:18,941 --> 00:39:20,443
<i>His grades have started to slip.</i>

1036
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:21,969
And the fight that happened today,

1037
00:39:22,069 --> 00:39:24,947
he was involved in that fight,
which turned out to be gang-related.

1038
00:39:25,114 --> 00:39:27,759
What do you mean "involved"?
Are you trying to say Jalen's in a gang?

1039
00:39:27,783 --> 00:39:29,618
If he's not already in a gang,

1040
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:32,246
he's strongly considering joining one.

1041
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,540
No, no. I'm sorry, Jalen...

1042
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,309
He knows better than that.
He wouldn't do that.

1043
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,294
I understand why you feel
that way, Mrs. Palmer,

1044
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:41,464
but there's also a reality of what
we face in our communities.

1045
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,924
So this year is absolutely
critical for him

1046
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:46,177
to build a foundation
to go off to college.

1047
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:48,554
See? This is what
I've been talking about.

1048
00:39:48,763 --> 00:39:50,181
I mean, with Jalen's grades,

1049
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:51,629
his test scores...

1050
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:53,618
No way in the world
we can't get him a scholarship

1051
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,936
at the private schools,
or remember Holy Cross

1052
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,247
I was telling you, that Catholic School?

1053
00:39:57,271 --> 00:39:58,351
We have to talk about this.

1054
00:39:58,439 --> 00:39:59,440
I'll talk to their coach.

1055
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:01,150
Mr. Palmer, now hold up.

1056
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,569
Hold up.
Now, that's not what I was suggesting.

1057
00:40:03,736 --> 00:40:06,405
We want Jalen to be here.
The school needs him here.

1058
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:07,615
For what?

1059
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,158
Seem like y'all losing him.

1060
00:40:09,325 --> 00:40:10,826
Mr. Palmer, I understand...

1061
00:40:10,993 --> 00:40:12,286
I'm supposed to sit here

1062
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:15,456
and we're going to sacrifice
our only son to this system?

1063
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,976
There's gotta be something
we can do to work together on this.

1064
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,961
Seems like the problem
is bigger than you and me.

1065
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,964
So, why are you pointing
the finger at Kenny?

1066
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:27,760
No, look.
I've been skeptical about that kid.

1067
00:40:28,427 --> 00:40:30,027
The whole reason he's living with Rashad

1068
00:40:30,137 --> 00:40:32,348
is because he got expelled
from school for fighting.

1069
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,184
Probably some gang-related shit.

1070
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,686
I ain't trying to have
Jalen get caught up,

1071
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:39,730
following behind some
little wannabe thug.

1072
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:42,691
So, you know, maybe we just
talk to him again

1073
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,193
or we ground him or something.

1074
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,004
I don't know,
but don't you think sending him

1075
00:40:46,028 --> 00:40:47,822
to Holy Cross is a little bit extreme?

1076
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:51,117
After what we just heard?
We gotta send him somewhere!

1077
00:40:51,784 --> 00:40:54,065
I'm not trying to get that call
in the middle of the night

1078
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,205
saying my son is locked up or worse,

1079
00:40:56,372 --> 00:40:58,290
because we didn't act
when we had a chance.

1080
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,169
Keep your elbow tucked.

1081
00:41:03,504 --> 00:41:04,880
Catholic school?

1082
00:41:05,047 --> 00:41:07,133
I don't know anybody in Catholic school.

1083
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:09,718
Good. Maybe it's time for you
to meet some Catholics.

1084
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:13,597
And tomorrow, I'm gonna re-introduce you
to the concept of a belt.

1085
00:41:14,223 --> 00:41:16,392
Ain't nobody wants to see
your butt cheeks hanging out.

1086
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:17,893
Nobody wears no belts.

1087
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,228
They're corny.

1088
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:20,855
Yeah, well, so is getting shot.

1089
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:24,042
When are you going to do something about

1090
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:26,068
that abomination on your head
called locks?

1091
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:27,570
I'm not cutting my locks.

1092
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,613
You need to do something with them.

1093
00:41:30,656 --> 00:41:33,009
You're the son of a barber,
you can't be walking around here

1094
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,273
looking like that girl from
<i>The Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

1095
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:37,228
They're supposed to look like that.

1096
00:41:37,371 --> 00:41:38,581
No, they're not.

1097
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,833
When you going to wash them things, man?

1098
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,586
Walking around smelling like
Flavor Flav's wave cap.

1099
00:41:43,961 --> 00:41:46,964
Why are you trying to take
everything I like away from me?

1100
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:53,345
Because I love you, that's why.

1101
00:41:55,973 --> 00:41:57,742
So just because you take some
long dramatic pause

1102
00:41:57,766 --> 00:41:58,767
before you say something,

1103
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,478
I'm supposed to just accept your words?

1104
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,064
You're so smart, Jalen.

1105
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:07,735
If you're that smart,
keep your elbow tucked.

1106
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:10,112
My elbow is tucked. My shot is water.

1107
00:42:12,448 --> 00:42:13,782
Your shot sucks.

1108
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,534
Whose shots suck?

1109
00:42:16,368 --> 00:42:17,953
Boy, you better ask somebody.

1110
00:42:18,746 --> 00:42:20,122
My shot is butter.

1111
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:25,211
Ew!

1112
00:42:31,884 --> 00:42:32,885
What up, broski?

1113
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:35,930
I got your message.

1114
00:42:36,096 --> 00:42:37,723
Shorties is wiling, right?

1115
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,308
How are you?

1116
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:42,394
Look, I'm going to need you to
keep your son away from mine.

1117
00:42:42,853 --> 00:42:44,063
What you talking about?

1118
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:46,191
You know that gang fight
that happened yesterday?

1119
00:42:46,565 --> 00:42:48,484
Kenny got Jalen involved in that shit.

1120
00:42:48,651 --> 00:42:49,902
No, that ain't what happened.

1121
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:53,239
I talked to Kenny, he said they was
standing there and the fight broke out.

1122
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:55,032
And you believed him?

1123
00:42:55,449 --> 00:42:57,701
Yeah, I believe him. He's my son.

1124
00:42:58,077 --> 00:42:59,662
You taking Jalen's word for it.

1125
00:42:59,828 --> 00:43:00,829
You damn right!

1126
00:43:00,996 --> 00:43:03,332
Jalen ain't never got
expelled from school for fighting.

1127
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,793
Oh, is it like that?

1128
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,088
I tell you something in
confidence, man-to-man,

1129
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,423
and now you throwing that shit
back in my face?

1130
00:43:11,924 --> 00:43:14,343
I told you that's who Kenny was
when he was with his mother.

1131
00:43:14,677 --> 00:43:16,637
He ain't that kid no more, he with me.

1132
00:43:16,804 --> 00:43:18,472
I'm happy for you.

1133
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:19,848
Nevertheless,

1134
00:43:20,015 --> 00:43:22,893
keep your son away from mine, man,
or we gonna have a problem.

1135
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:28,691
Bruh, we got a problem right now.

1136
00:43:29,942 --> 00:43:31,110
<i>Wow!</i>

1137
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:35,531
Two black fathers
bonding in the hood.

1138
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:36,782
It's rare.

1139
00:43:36,949 --> 00:43:38,534
It's like catching a unicorn.

1140
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,203
You don't see it every day,
is what I'm trying to say. Right?

1141
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,581
You want a latte?

1142
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,295
"One-Stop's Home and Office Decoration."

1143
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:50,462
Ghetto office.

1144
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:52,673
Ghetto office,
you decorate somebody's shit.

1145
00:43:55,551 --> 00:43:56,844
So the dog ate the whole condom?

1146
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:58,012
Yeah.

1147
00:43:58,178 --> 00:43:59,680
Frame your face. Shit.

1148
00:44:01,974 --> 00:44:04,893
- Okay, Eddie. Come on, man.
- Oh.

1149
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,060
You know what, I've happened
to have enough of him.

1150
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:10,616
Lord, they shooting!
They shooting out there!

1151
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:12,067
Eddie, stop playing! Get down!

1152
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:14,486
Hell! It'll take me too long
to get back up.

1153
00:44:14,653 --> 00:44:16,453
I ain't getting down there,
it ain't worth it.

1154
00:44:17,156 --> 00:44:18,157
It's fine.

1155
00:44:18,324 --> 00:44:20,367
This ain't Fallujah. Come on.
Everybody, stand up.

1156
00:44:23,662 --> 00:44:24,830
<i>My God. I gotta go.</i>

1157
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:25,998
I can't take it.

1158
00:44:26,165 --> 00:44:27,833
Baby, that's a gang out there.

1159
00:44:28,042 --> 00:44:29,585
<i>It ain't no ice cream truck.</i>

1160
00:44:29,752 --> 00:44:32,152
The idea is stay away from the bullet,
don't go towards them.

1161
00:44:32,254 --> 00:44:33,648
I don't think you understand, Eddie.

1162
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:34,952
My car broke down earlier today.

1163
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:38,594
I can't be caught outside with no car
and it's dark and they're shooting...

1164
00:44:38,761 --> 00:44:40,572
- Draya, I got you.
<i>- It's crazy right now!</i>

1165
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,276
<i>I gotta get Maya anyway.
You're on the way,</i>

1166
00:44:42,389 --> 00:44:43,432
so I got you.

1167
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,933
Are you serious, Rashad?

1168
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,494
<i>Hold on, let me get my stuff.</i>

1169
00:44:47,770 --> 00:44:48,896
Thank you.

1170
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,505
<i>All right. You good, Eddie?</i>

1171
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:53,359
Yeah, I'm good.

1172
00:44:54,777 --> 00:44:56,779
I need to get on out of here anyway.

1173
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,281
Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.

1174
00:44:59,615 --> 00:45:01,033
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1175
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:04,370
With all that ass, she ain't safe nowhere.

1176
00:45:04,912 --> 00:45:07,140
The New York Times
<i>broke this down recently.</i>

1177
00:45:07,164 --> 00:45:09,833
Okay, let's see.

1178
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:20,302
<i>The second amendment means
we have a right to bear arms.</i>

1179
00:45:20,469 --> 00:45:23,639
<i>Should it also mean that
there is no place in our...</i>

1180
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:41,407
I cannot believe that crazy man
came in the store doing that today.

1181
00:45:41,573 --> 00:45:42,950
He was wild!

1182
00:45:43,742 --> 00:45:45,661
No, he played us all.

1183
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:46,870
He was crazy.

1184
00:45:47,162 --> 00:45:48,288
Crazy!

1185
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:54,503
All right, then.

1186
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,172
I'll catch you tomorrow.

1187
00:46:04,972 --> 00:46:06,348
Are you okay, Rashad?

1188
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:08,350
Like, seriously.

1189
00:46:08,851 --> 00:46:11,812
Like, I don't know,
lately you've been so stressed out.

1190
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:13,856
I'm good! I'm good.

1191
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:15,190
You good?

1192
00:46:15,357 --> 00:46:16,442
Draya, I'm good.

1193
00:46:16,692 --> 00:46:19,611
Well, if you need anything,

1194
00:46:19,778 --> 00:46:22,531
even if you just want to talk,
I'm a great listener.

1195
00:46:24,158 --> 00:46:26,702
I know you cool. I appreciate that.

1196
00:46:26,869 --> 00:46:28,954
I might take you up on that one day.

1197
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:33,000
Well, what time you gotta pick up Maya?

1198
00:46:34,835 --> 00:46:38,755
Maybe we can go upstairs
and we could talk now.

1199
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,841
Come on, Draya.

1200
00:46:41,258 --> 00:46:42,301
What?

1201
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,429
You're inviting me to your house
just to come and talk?

1202
00:46:46,346 --> 00:46:48,140
As opposed to what?

1203
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:50,684
I mean, I ain't been out
the game that long, Draya.

1204
00:46:51,351 --> 00:46:52,728
Are you serious?

1205
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:56,398
A pretty girl tries to comfort you
in your time of stress

1206
00:46:56,565 --> 00:46:58,042
and whatever the hell else
you're going through,

1207
00:46:58,066 --> 00:46:59,693
and you gonna take it there with me?

1208
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:03,322
Look, my bad.
I thought you was really...

1209
00:47:03,489 --> 00:47:06,241
Come on. Just because I'm thick,
it doesn't mean I don't have a soul.

1210
00:47:06,408 --> 00:47:08,219
But the way you was talking,
it felt like you wanted to...

1211
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:09,387
You know what? Good night, Rashad.

1212
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:11,246
It felt like... I thought you was...

1213
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,040
Good night, Rashad!

1214
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:14,249
<i>Draya, it felt...</i>

1215
00:47:14,416 --> 00:47:16,001
Draya! Draya!

1216
00:47:17,419 --> 00:47:18,545
Damn!

1217
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:20,839
Damn. Oh.

1218
00:47:21,882 --> 00:47:22,966
Oh, man.

1219
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:25,093
Ah, man.

1220
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:27,425
Man, she definitely wanted it.
I know she wanted it!

1221
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,848
Hell, yeah! What do you think?

1222
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:32,296
You think I ain't gonna think that?
I mean, she got the...

1223
00:47:32,434 --> 00:47:34,603
She sitting there
with it all out like, "Yo."

1224
00:47:34,770 --> 00:47:36,438
Leaning over. I mean...

1225
00:47:36,605 --> 00:47:39,005
I ain't tripping, right?
I ain't been out the game that long.

1226
00:47:39,107 --> 00:47:40,400
You know what I'm saying?

1227
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:44,738
Damn! She said,
"You wanna come inside and talk..."

1228
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:49,451
She definitely wanted it. Right? Right?

1229
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:52,722
Baby, I just wanted you
to know that you were right!

1230
00:47:52,746 --> 00:47:54,289
You hit the nail on the head.

1231
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:56,041
- Babe, listen.
<i>- You had the hammer!</i>

1232
00:47:56,208 --> 00:47:58,293
We gonna send his heathen ass
to Catholic school!

1233
00:47:58,460 --> 00:48:00,462
- Babe, stop it!
<i>- I'm gonna call the Catholics.</i>

1234
00:48:00,629 --> 00:48:02,273
I'm gonna call Jesus.
Somebody call some Marys.

1235
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:04,132
- Okay...
<i>- The Holy Cross, we coming!</i>

1236
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:06,134
You and your lady having problems, huh?

1237
00:48:06,301 --> 00:48:08,971
I can help.
You know I have counseling services.

1238
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:11,223
I got single, I got couple, I got group.

1239
00:48:11,557 --> 00:48:13,976
<i>If you choose groups,
the responsibilities would be</i>

1240
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,811
to bring in cookies and, or,

1241
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:17,854
fruit punch every third meeting.

1242
00:48:19,314 --> 00:48:22,276
No, thank you, man. I'm good.
We don't need no damn session.

1243
00:48:22,651 --> 00:48:24,486
Here, man. Here's the check.

1244
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:25,654
Mmm!

1245
00:48:25,821 --> 00:48:27,322
Calvin, before I take that check,

1246
00:48:27,489 --> 00:48:29,408
I'm going to tell you,
it's non-refundable.

1247
00:48:29,783 --> 00:48:32,160
If I take that check,
that check goes away.

1248
00:48:32,327 --> 00:48:35,998
And if you don't have that
remaining balance on Monday,

1249
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:37,165
I promise you,

1250
00:48:37,332 --> 00:48:39,835
it is not a homing pigeon,
it does not come back.

1251
00:48:40,294 --> 00:48:42,374
You know how Mike Tyson has
those birds on that roof?

1252
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:45,257
He can let those birds go.
"Go, go!" You know?

1253
00:48:45,632 --> 00:48:48,677
Birds fly around,
birds come back on his hand.

1254
00:48:48,844 --> 00:48:50,012
He looks at that bird.

1255
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,014
Right?

1256
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:53,575
That ain't gonna happen. You understand?

1257
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:54,919
I know what non-refundable means.

1258
00:48:55,017 --> 00:48:56,351
It's forfeited.

1259
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,329
I just wanna let you know.
'Cause you're my man.

1260
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:01,648
Damn, man. Is it One-Stop or non-stop?
Take the check.

1261
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:07,195
Certified check. Nice.

1262
00:49:07,362 --> 00:49:09,531
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Calvin.

1263
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,930
I'm gonna hold off on that handshake

1264
00:49:12,034 --> 00:49:15,829
until you make that remaining
balance payment on Monday.

1265
00:49:15,996 --> 00:49:18,790
Just in case you do some nigga shit.

1266
00:49:19,166 --> 00:49:20,876
Hey, don't tell nobody.

1267
00:49:21,835 --> 00:49:24,379
It's going down
this weekend, y'all!

1268
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:26,024
Jackie, what are you talking about now?

1269
00:49:26,048 --> 00:49:28,550
<i>Girl, my husband's
got me all stressed out.</i>

1270
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:31,219
Police got him working
back-to-back double shifts.

1271
00:49:31,845 --> 00:49:34,431
Okay. I just need
a little touch up now, Angie.

1272
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:35,724
Oh!

1273
00:49:35,891 --> 00:49:37,059
- Touch up?
- Mmm-hmm.

1274
00:49:37,309 --> 00:49:41,688
No. No, baby, you got to pull them roots
all the way up like a turnip...

1275
00:49:41,897 --> 00:49:43,357
<i>Turn it over, ball it</i>

1276
00:49:43,523 --> 00:49:45,692
and then put it back in your head.

1277
00:49:45,901 --> 00:49:47,653
Jackie, I mean, no shade,

1278
00:49:47,819 --> 00:49:50,530
but, God, you should be ashamed
to walk out the house like this.

1279
00:49:50,697 --> 00:49:54,409
Girl, how you gonna say, "No shade,"
and then shade the shit out that lady.

1280
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:56,328
<i>Thank you.</i>

1281
00:49:56,495 --> 00:49:58,705
Y'all know the boy
that got shot didn't make it.

1282
00:49:58,914 --> 00:50:00,999
- Oh, my God. That's terrible.
- Uh-huh.

1283
00:50:01,166 --> 00:50:02,167
No.

1284
00:50:02,334 --> 00:50:03,654
Pronounced him dead this morning.

1285
00:50:04,503 --> 00:50:06,421
<i>My husband said that
this whole thing started</i>

1286
00:50:06,588 --> 00:50:07,589
because of some fight

1287
00:50:07,756 --> 00:50:09,476
that happened over there
at the high school.

1288
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:13,637
Y'all know what happened last time
one of their leaders got killed.

1289
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:15,055
It was a bloodbath.

1290
00:50:15,222 --> 00:50:16,407
Well, the police chief's planning on

1291
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:18,725
doubling the amount of cops
on the streets this weekend.

1292
00:50:18,892 --> 00:50:20,435
Man, I'm so tired of this mess!

1293
00:50:20,602 --> 00:50:21,895
<i>Every time I turn around,</i>

1294
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:23,772
somebody is killing somebody over nothing.

1295
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,124
<i>And what are we supposed to do?</i>

1296
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,109
Lock our doors, don't snitch.

1297
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,194
Pretend like this shit is normal?

1298
00:50:29,403 --> 00:50:30,946
This is bullshit, this is not normal.

1299
00:50:31,113 --> 00:50:32,614
Then we gotta do something about it.

1300
00:50:33,323 --> 00:50:36,410
Shorties out here wiling
and that's our fault. That's on us.

1301
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:39,454
Look, if we get people
to come to the shop,

1302
00:50:39,621 --> 00:50:42,124
I don't care what neighborhood they from.
They from Chatham,

1303
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:45,293
<i>from Englewood, East Side,
crazy, wherever they from,</i>

1304
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,795
we just need people from the city

1305
00:50:46,962 --> 00:50:49,423
to come meet up in the shop,
and we just talk.

1306
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:50,911
<i>And give them a chance to speak.</i>

1307
00:50:51,049 --> 00:50:52,426
They're gonna come up with ideas.

1308
00:50:52,592 --> 00:50:54,219
I think that's a great idea, Rashad.

1309
00:50:54,803 --> 00:50:56,805
Really great idea, baby.

1310
00:50:57,681 --> 00:50:58,974
Well, I say we do it.

1311
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,576
<i>Y'all know we have to do it.</i>

1312
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,060
I mean, the gangs have us scared.

1313
00:51:02,269 --> 00:51:03,437
They're killing everybody.

1314
00:51:03,645 --> 00:51:05,397
<i>We don't wanna walk outside anymore.</i>

1315
00:51:05,564 --> 00:51:07,482
Them people downtown,
they aren't moving for us.

1316
00:51:07,649 --> 00:51:10,569
I mean, if we don't do something,
no one's gonna save our community.

1317
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,238
We gotta take our streets back.

1318
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:25,459
<i>Action, LeShawn!</i>

1319
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:27,270
- Stacia!
<i>- Sorry, action, Stacia!</i>

1320
00:51:27,294 --> 00:51:28,614
Stop the violence, y'all!

1321
00:51:28,670 --> 00:51:30,505
Exactly. Calvin's Shop.

1322
00:51:30,672 --> 00:51:31,816
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

1323
00:51:31,840 --> 00:51:33,985
- Oh, come on, man!
<i>- You watch that booty shaking!</i>

1324
00:51:34,009 --> 00:51:35,510
- Calvin's Shop...
- Listen, guys!

1325
00:51:35,677 --> 00:51:36,863
We know you don't
care about your community,

1326
00:51:36,887 --> 00:51:39,264
but you gotta care about this.

1327
00:51:39,473 --> 00:51:40,825
<i>Please come down to Calvin's Shop tonight</i>

1328
00:51:40,849 --> 00:51:41,933
for the community summit,

1329
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:43,685
because dreams apparently

1330
00:51:43,852 --> 00:51:45,687
are being deferred even as we speak.

1331
00:51:45,854 --> 00:51:47,689
- Yeah!
- I think we got it.

1332
00:51:50,192 --> 00:51:51,276
Okay.

1333
00:51:56,448 --> 00:51:58,200
<i>- Move!
- Ow.</i>

1334
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:00,869
<i>Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!</i>

1335
00:52:01,119 --> 00:52:02,996
<i>You can look, but do not touch.</i>

1336
00:52:03,205 --> 00:52:04,372
<i>Look back at it.</i>

1337
00:52:04,539 --> 00:52:06,208
<i>- You like that?
- I'm good.</i>

1338
00:52:06,374 --> 00:52:07,518
<i>We're out in the street, you know.</i>

1339
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:08,728
<i>This isn't the privacy
of your own bedroom.</i>

1340
00:52:08,752 --> 00:52:09,836
<i>Yeah, girl!</i>

1341
00:52:18,345 --> 00:52:20,388
<i>We wanna
thank y'all for being here.</i>

1342
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:22,891
There's still seats available
if you need a seat.

1343
00:52:23,058 --> 00:52:25,685
It's important that we all are here
because this is our community.

1344
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:29,064
<i>And it's up to us to change it,
so, we wanna hear y'all ideas.</i>

1345
00:52:29,648 --> 00:52:31,525
I was thinking more like
a benefit concert.

1346
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:33,193
You know, something for the kids.

1347
00:52:33,485 --> 00:52:34,925
<i>I think we should just call up Kanye</i>

1348
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,547
and have him come on out and perform.

1349
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,156
Yes!

1350
00:52:39,032 --> 00:52:41,952
He ain't coming around y'all
broke negroes.

1351
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,245
Are you serious right now?

1352
00:52:43,411 --> 00:52:45,121
<i>Look, Kanye a Kardashian now.</i>

1353
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,082
He wears dresses now.

1354
00:52:47,249 --> 00:52:49,084
I seen him on TV, he had a skirt on.

1355
00:52:49,251 --> 00:52:50,252
His knees were showing.

1356
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:52,754
All right, all right, all right. Relax!

1357
00:52:54,172 --> 00:52:55,173
What about R. Kelly?

1358
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:56,341
What?

1359
00:52:56,508 --> 00:52:58,343
R. Kelly? For a kids benefit?

1360
00:52:58,510 --> 00:52:59,678
Kelly love the kids.

1361
00:52:59,845 --> 00:53:01,725
Yeah, he can teach them
how to make home movies.

1362
00:53:02,222 --> 00:53:03,223
No, he didn't.

1363
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:05,767
All right, already! Leave him alone!

1364
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:09,521
Do you realize how much good quality
R&B we'd have missed out on,

1365
00:53:09,688 --> 00:53:11,940
because y'all keep bringing up
that same old bull?

1366
00:53:12,107 --> 00:53:13,358
<i>The last albums he made,</i>

1367
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:15,861
them albums was made out of pure stress.

1368
00:53:16,778 --> 00:53:19,239
Does anybody else have any other ideas?

1369
00:53:19,573 --> 00:53:20,782
I'd like to say something.

1370
00:53:21,408 --> 00:53:22,868
Look, Eddie, you once said

1371
00:53:23,118 --> 00:53:25,096
that the barbershop is
the pillar of the neighborhood.

1372
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:26,246
Damn right!

1373
00:53:26,413 --> 00:53:27,539
So we use that, right?

1374
00:53:27,706 --> 00:53:30,125
We turn the shop into our
safe space for the weekend.

1375
00:53:30,375 --> 00:53:31,769
<i>All right?
Neutral grounds where both sides</i>

1376
00:53:31,793 --> 00:53:32,961
can come together peacefully.

1377
00:53:33,128 --> 00:53:34,462
- I like that.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1378
00:53:34,629 --> 00:53:36,798
- Turn this place into Switzerland.
- Exactly!

1379
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:38,234
Ain't no way in hell the South Side

1380
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:40,635
is ever going to resemble
any parts of Switzerland.

1381
00:53:41,052 --> 00:53:42,637
I don't even know no black Swiss.

1382
00:53:42,804 --> 00:53:43,889
I mean, Swizz Beatz.

1383
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,266
<i>Is he black? Or is he white?</i>

1384
00:53:46,433 --> 00:53:48,143
You know, he is a little beige.

1385
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,312
<i>He might be Swiss. I mean...</i>

1386
00:53:50,478 --> 00:53:52,981
He named himself to it.
So, he's Swiss. He's Swiss.

1387
00:53:53,148 --> 00:53:54,292
<i>Can we get back to it?</i>

1388
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:56,156
We could try to get
both sides to come together

1389
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:57,986
and agree to a ceasefire.

1390
00:53:58,153 --> 00:53:59,673
<i>And then we can get the Chicago celebs</i>

1391
00:53:59,738 --> 00:54:01,178
to tweet about it and talk about it.

1392
00:54:01,323 --> 00:54:02,616
Get them to support.

1393
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:03,950
That's good, Jerrod.

1394
00:54:04,117 --> 00:54:05,160
You know what, he's right.

1395
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:07,913
That means that we have
to give them something to see.

1396
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,919
Yeah, maybe we could
just give away free gifts.

1397
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:11,249
Like a radio promotion.

1398
00:54:11,416 --> 00:54:12,417
Yes!

1399
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:14,228
And who's supposed to pay
for these free gifts?

1400
00:54:14,252 --> 00:54:18,256
Draya is right, we need some
incentive to bring people out.

1401
00:54:18,423 --> 00:54:21,760
I don't want to state the obvious here,
but this is a barbershop.

1402
00:54:22,135 --> 00:54:24,804
We could just do what we already do.
For free.

1403
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:26,306
Free cuts the whole weekend?

1404
00:54:26,473 --> 00:54:28,600
You know how much money
we pull in on Saturday alone?

1405
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:31,645
Do you know how much we're gonna
lose if that enclosure happens?

1406
00:54:31,811 --> 00:54:33,521
- Mmm-hmm.
- It's a great idea, Calvin.

1407
00:54:33,688 --> 00:54:35,106
<i>It is. It is a great idea.</i>

1408
00:54:35,273 --> 00:54:36,650
Yeah, a 48-hour ceasefire,

1409
00:54:36,858 --> 00:54:39,611
with unlimited free cuts and styling.

1410
00:54:39,778 --> 00:54:41,863
I mean, come on,
who could turn that down?

1411
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:45,533
I propose that Gangsta Grub
be the official caterer for this.

1412
00:54:45,700 --> 00:54:47,202
Yeah, I bet you would.

1413
00:54:47,369 --> 00:54:48,804
Hell, yeah, dude!
You know how much money

1414
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:51,790
I can make out on these streets
in a 48-hour...

1415
00:54:52,457 --> 00:54:54,834
To donate to the Boys and Girls Club!

1416
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,211
That's R. Kelly's favorite.

1417
00:54:56,378 --> 00:54:57,671
<i>Listen here, Bollyhood!</i>

1418
00:54:58,129 --> 00:54:59,506
Leave Kels alone, God damn it,

1419
00:54:59,673 --> 00:55:01,591
I say, God damn it, leave Kels alone!

1420
00:55:02,384 --> 00:55:03,843
Sorry about that, go ahead.

1421
00:55:04,177 --> 00:55:06,137
Then I think that we have a plan!

1422
00:55:12,978 --> 00:55:15,188
Hold up, hold up.
We've got one little problem.

1423
00:55:15,897 --> 00:55:17,524
<i>Y'all know to have a ceasefire,</i>

1424
00:55:17,691 --> 00:55:20,068
we got to get the shot callers
to call a truce.

1425
00:55:20,777 --> 00:55:22,296
<i>Y'all know what happened the last time</i>

1426
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:24,406
we got Marquis and Jay up in here.

1427
00:55:24,656 --> 00:55:25,896
It was damn near World War III.

1428
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:27,242
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1429
00:55:29,035 --> 00:55:31,746
But you know what?
What if we made that mix-up happen again?

1430
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:47,887
<i>This is just a terrible idea.</i>

1431
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:49,454
Yeah. "Let's cause a little mix-up.

1432
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:51,349
"Let's make that mix-up happen again."

1433
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:52,868
That was the dumbest thing you ever said.

1434
00:55:52,892 --> 00:55:54,120
Do you know who these people are?

1435
00:55:54,144 --> 00:55:55,145
<i>They are murderers.</i>

1436
00:55:55,311 --> 00:55:57,081
<i>They don't work at the grocery store,
and if they did,</i>

1437
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:58,898
they would be butchers.

1438
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,108
Quiet!

1439
00:56:00,275 --> 00:56:03,069
Thank God you wore
a G-Unit bulletproof vest.

1440
00:56:03,236 --> 00:56:04,821
Yeah, it worked for 50!

1441
00:56:05,113 --> 00:56:08,908
No, it didn't, actually.
He got shot in the face!

1442
00:56:09,409 --> 00:56:10,618
He got shot in the face?

1443
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:13,705
Draya! What's up, baby girl?

1444
00:56:14,748 --> 00:56:16,225
Hold up, Calvin! What's going on in here?

1445
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:17,792
Is this a set-up?

1446
00:56:18,084 --> 00:56:19,961
- Listen to me.
- Jay! Jay!

1447
00:56:20,128 --> 00:56:21,171
No, stop!

1448
00:56:21,337 --> 00:56:22,523
<i>Hold on, hold on, hold on.</i>

1449
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:24,632
Hold on!

1450
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,217
Hold on! Wait a minute!

1451
00:56:26,384 --> 00:56:27,635
- I wish you would, boy!
- Jay!

1452
00:56:27,802 --> 00:56:30,597
Listen! Now, I've been knowing you guys
for about 20 years, man.

1453
00:56:30,764 --> 00:56:32,116
My father used to cut both of your heads!

1454
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,433
Come on, bruh.

1455
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:35,720
Out of respect for him
and the shop, man, hear us out.

1456
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:37,562
We're asking y'all for 10 minutes.

1457
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:39,647
<i>That's all we asking for, bruh.</i>

1458
00:56:42,484 --> 00:56:45,528
Oh, I need more time, God.
I don't wanna die a virgin.

1459
00:56:45,904 --> 00:56:47,155
Come on, Jason.

1460
00:56:47,322 --> 00:56:48,615
Come on, G. Come on, man.

1461
00:56:48,782 --> 00:56:50,241
<i>Let's do this, man.</i>

1462
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:51,576
Have a seat.

1463
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:01,669
We all good. Come on, big boy.

1464
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:04,631
Sit on down for a second. Get on.

1465
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:19,354
Are we good?

1466
00:57:22,565 --> 00:57:24,234
Hey, Rev.

1467
00:57:24,526 --> 00:57:26,903
Fifteen fish dinners for bingo night?

1468
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,780
Hell, yeah! Ha-ha!

1469
00:57:28,947 --> 00:57:30,406
I mean, praise God!

1470
00:57:30,573 --> 00:57:32,867
How about some sweet potato pie?
All right.

1471
00:57:34,077 --> 00:57:36,329
All right! What's cooking? Daddy's home!

1472
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:38,724
J.D., don't come up in here
with all that shit today, okay?

1473
00:57:38,748 --> 00:57:39,892
We don't have time for that shit.

1474
00:57:39,916 --> 00:57:41,000
- Okay?
- Mabel.

1475
00:57:41,167 --> 00:57:43,711
What did I ask you to do?
More of this. More parsley.

1476
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:45,713
<i>Okay? You? You better hurry it up!</i>

1477
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,817
Okay, I don't even know why
he got a goddamn hairnet on.

1478
00:57:47,841 --> 00:57:50,051
He don't even have no hair.
You guys are tripping!

1479
00:57:50,218 --> 00:57:51,445
- That's good.
<i>- Lord have mercy.</i>

1480
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:53,149
More flour. Put some more.
Don't be scared.

1481
00:57:53,179 --> 00:57:54,305
You didn't buy it!

1482
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:55,741
<i>It's gotta be out of here by 2:00.</i>

1483
00:57:55,765 --> 00:57:56,766
You have a break yet?

1484
00:57:56,933 --> 00:57:58,268
Knead it, knead it! Knead it

1485
00:57:58,434 --> 00:58:00,145
like you knead a bitch's ass. Okay?

1486
00:58:00,311 --> 00:58:01,813
- Come on! Hmm?
- Mabel.

1487
00:58:01,980 --> 00:58:03,374
What happened to us
giving them a break, huh?

1488
00:58:03,398 --> 00:58:04,399
For what?

1489
00:58:04,607 --> 00:58:06,043
We've got to keep the talent healthy.

1490
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:08,862
- Negro, I'm the talent.
- Oh!

1491
00:58:09,028 --> 00:58:11,531
You got me twisted on there,
talking about the talent.

1492
00:58:11,698 --> 00:58:13,908
You ain't doing shit out there
worth a damn...

1493
00:58:14,075 --> 00:58:16,244
You may be the talent, but I'm the face.

1494
00:58:16,411 --> 00:58:17,745
<i>All right?</i>

1495
00:58:19,747 --> 00:58:20,748
Look, Nana...

1496
00:58:20,915 --> 00:58:25,211
We don't want this gravy train
to stop flowing anytime soon.

1497
00:58:26,754 --> 00:58:28,047
Look at that, hmm?

1498
00:58:29,007 --> 00:58:30,717
That's just from this morning.

1499
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:33,428
Talent! You all take five.

1500
00:58:33,595 --> 00:58:34,637
Go.

1501
00:58:34,888 --> 00:58:36,389
Talent, take six.

1502
00:58:36,848 --> 00:58:37,849
Hmm?

1503
00:58:40,476 --> 00:58:42,103
<i>I know it seems like a lot.</i>

1504
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,938
But we just asking for two days.

1505
00:58:45,106 --> 00:58:46,774
Two days and no bloodshed.

1506
00:58:46,983 --> 00:58:48,151
Exactly, gentlemen.

1507
00:58:48,318 --> 00:58:50,361
Not to oversell it,
but what's gonna happen is,

1508
00:58:50,528 --> 00:58:51,755
<i>you guys go home for the weekend,</i>

1509
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:53,323
<i>and all your friends on Friday</i>

1510
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:55,283
will still be alive come Monday morning.

1511
00:58:56,784 --> 00:58:58,077
It's not a bad deal.

1512
00:59:04,125 --> 00:59:05,126
Oh...

1513
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,628
Why'd I do that?

1514
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:08,630
Look, all we trying to say, man, is,

1515
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:11,883
<i>we got sons, I know y'all got kids,</i>

1516
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:15,511
and we just trying to make sure
our kids get to their 18th birthday.

1517
00:59:15,678 --> 00:59:17,138
And 19th and 20th.

1518
00:59:17,388 --> 00:59:19,474
<i>And it gotta start somewhere, man.</i>

1519
00:59:19,641 --> 00:59:23,269
And we say it starts here
this weekend for two days.

1520
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:25,480
<i>But we need y'all.</i>

1521
00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:27,482
<i>Y'all the shot callers.</i>

1522
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:30,485
We just need y'all to call some shots.

1523
00:59:51,923 --> 00:59:53,299
I'm in.

1524
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,803
Because of you, Cal.

1525
00:59:57,887 --> 00:59:59,389
Appreciate it, man.

1526
01:00:06,062 --> 01:00:07,188
I got you.

1527
01:00:10,817 --> 01:00:11,818
All right, everybody,

1528
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,611
<i>we're good to go this weekend.</i>

1529
01:00:13,778 --> 01:00:15,488
All right, there we go.

1530
01:00:15,655 --> 01:00:17,782
- Let's get ready.
- Yes, sir.

1531
01:00:17,949 --> 01:00:20,201
Hey, thanks for taking care
of me earlier, Rashad.

1532
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,662
- I really appreciate it.
- We all good.

1533
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:24,455
And...

1534
01:00:24,622 --> 01:00:27,041
Thanks for giving me
a ride home the other night.

1535
01:00:27,208 --> 01:00:30,044
You were a real gentleman, Shady-Shad.

1536
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:37,093
<i>So you took the bitch home.</i>

1537
01:00:37,468 --> 01:00:39,679
Look, she needed a ride home
so I gave her a ride home.

1538
01:00:39,846 --> 01:00:40,930
I'm a good dude.

1539
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:43,826
It was nighttime, she was by herself.
I wasn't gonna leave her out there.

1540
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,619
It's crazy out there.
What else was I supposed to do?

1541
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,061
Draya works in a barbershop.

1542
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:49,581
There were plenty of other good dudes
who could've taken her home.

1543
01:00:49,605 --> 01:00:50,765
Why'd you have to be the one?

1544
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:52,025
Because it was on the way.

1545
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,192
Bullshit!

1546
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:54,652
I know girls like Draya.

1547
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:57,238
I see through her fake lashes,
and her watermelon ass,

1548
01:00:57,405 --> 01:00:59,240
and her whole damsel-in-distress routine.

1549
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:00,825
She wants you, Rashad.

1550
01:01:00,992 --> 01:01:03,161
Are you dumb enough
to fall into that girl's trap?

1551
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:04,370
Terri...

1552
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:06,247
You come home every other night

1553
01:01:06,456 --> 01:01:08,666
from some video shoot
or some athlete's commercial.

1554
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,209
Do I ever question it?

1555
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:12,378
No, because I trust you.

1556
01:01:12,545 --> 01:01:14,714
I know you hold me down,
I'm holding you down.

1557
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:16,841
I don't care, I don't like that bitch.

1558
01:01:17,342 --> 01:01:19,135
Look, I promise you...

1559
01:01:19,302 --> 01:01:21,971
I promise you, there's nothing
going on with me and Draya.

1560
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:23,723
I need you to know that, okay?

1561
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:27,727
- Pull your pants down.
- What?

1562
01:01:27,894 --> 01:01:29,079
Pull your pants down, we're doing it.

1563
01:01:29,103 --> 01:01:30,414
What the hell are you doing, girl?

1564
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:32,106
Stepping up my lazy side booty game.

1565
01:01:32,273 --> 01:01:33,353
- Let's go.
- Yo, chill out.

1566
01:01:33,441 --> 01:01:34,641
- Be quiet.
- I am being quiet.

1567
01:01:34,692 --> 01:01:35,693
You're gonna wake her up.

1568
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,421
I don't care, we can be quiet. Let's go.

1569
01:01:37,445 --> 01:01:38,605
Chill out! Chill out! Look...

1570
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:41,313
We ain't having sex on demand,
I ain't no piece of meat.

1571
01:01:41,407 --> 01:01:42,909
- "Let's go." Look...
- Whatever.

1572
01:01:43,951 --> 01:01:45,286
Get up in it.

1573
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:49,123
Get up in it. Now!

1574
01:01:50,416 --> 01:01:51,793
I mean...

1575
01:01:51,959 --> 01:01:54,128
I am aroused though, I ain't gonna lie.

1576
01:01:54,629 --> 01:01:56,964
But I got this sofrito sauce
on the stove, I'll be back.

1577
01:01:57,131 --> 01:01:59,717
What? You're just proving my point!

1578
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:02,303
And your sofrito sauce
don't taste better than me!

1579
01:02:06,224 --> 01:02:07,642
You're not going nowhere.

1580
01:02:08,309 --> 01:02:09,936
Not this weekend.

1581
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:12,730
It's too crazy out there on them streets.

1582
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:14,792
But, Dad, there's a three-on-three
tournament this weekend!

1583
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:16,651
I don't care about no basketball.

1584
01:02:16,818 --> 01:02:20,154
Do you know your mama found
gang paraphernalia in your drawer?

1585
01:02:20,905 --> 01:02:22,490
In my house!

1586
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:24,182
Now how am I supposed to trust you?

1587
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:25,827
Man, this ain't fair!

1588
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,287
None of my team has gotta deal
with these stupid rules!

1589
01:02:28,454 --> 01:02:30,123
You know why? Do you know why?

1590
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:31,833
Because most of those knuckleheads

1591
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,936
ain't even got a father
to look out for them anyway.

1592
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:35,294
But they look out for me.

1593
01:02:35,461 --> 01:02:38,131
When I'm at school,
my boys are the ones that got my back.

1594
01:02:38,297 --> 01:02:40,425
Who you talking about?
You talking about Kenny?

1595
01:02:40,591 --> 01:02:42,260
You think that's your boy?

1596
01:02:42,927 --> 01:02:44,767
Why you always gotta say
something about Kenny?

1597
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:47,071
Aren't you and Uncle Shad like brothers?

1598
01:02:47,181 --> 01:02:48,808
- Why you always tripping?
- Hey!

1599
01:02:48,975 --> 01:02:50,268
You watch your mouth, Jalen!

1600
01:02:50,685 --> 01:02:52,854
Now, I'm not one of your friends, okay?

1601
01:02:53,187 --> 01:02:56,190
I don't see why you don't understand
how dangerous it is out there

1602
01:02:56,357 --> 01:02:59,193
and that we don't approve of
who you're associating with!

1603
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,839
What? You want me to hang out
with the cornball that cleans the shop?

1604
01:03:01,863 --> 01:03:02,947
What's wrong with Anthony?

1605
01:03:03,114 --> 01:03:05,032
Why is it corny to be smart?

1606
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,326
Why is it corny to do what you're asked?

1607
01:03:07,702 --> 01:03:10,037
Why is it corny to handle your business?

1608
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,999
That's not corny, son.
That's being a man.

1609
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:20,006
Look, J... I know you're mad.

1610
01:03:20,173 --> 01:03:21,382
I know you're upset.

1611
01:03:21,549 --> 01:03:23,050
But listen,

1612
01:03:23,217 --> 01:03:26,220
you gotta realize how lucky you are
to have two parents

1613
01:03:26,387 --> 01:03:28,307
that wanna know where you are,
what you're doing,

1614
01:03:28,347 --> 01:03:30,016
who you're associating with.

1615
01:03:30,183 --> 01:03:31,225
That's important.

1616
01:03:31,392 --> 01:03:32,894
You're lucky.

1617
01:03:34,145 --> 01:03:35,730
I don't feel lucky.

1618
01:03:36,814 --> 01:03:39,025
My life would be so much
better if you wasn't in it.

1619
01:03:39,192 --> 01:03:40,401
What? What'd you say? Jalen!

1620
01:03:40,568 --> 01:03:42,212
- Did you hear him?
- Baby, please wait! Hey!

1621
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:43,321
Hey, boy!

1622
01:03:43,488 --> 01:03:44,572
Did you hear what he said?

1623
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:46,049
I know, but listen, he didn't mean it!

1624
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,242
He's angry and he's 14.

1625
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:50,411
Well, I'm angry and I'm older than 14.

1626
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:52,330
- Boy, you ain't white!
- Okay, babe...

1627
01:03:52,497 --> 01:03:54,916
Listen, at some point, he's gonna realize

1628
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:57,002
that we're doing all of this
because we love him.

1629
01:03:57,084 --> 01:03:58,920
- But he's not a tough guy.
- I know.

1630
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:01,589
He's trying to act like it.
Boy, you not a tough guy!

1631
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:03,216
Hey, I know that.

1632
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,927
South Side's no place to flex.

1633
01:04:07,762 --> 01:04:10,097
You ain't got it like that,
you need to ease back

1634
01:04:10,264 --> 01:04:12,600
'cause the consequences
out here are way too thin.

1635
01:04:12,767 --> 01:04:15,561
I know, but clearly,
he's going through something.

1636
01:04:16,729 --> 01:04:19,106
But you and me? We raised a smart kid.

1637
01:04:19,774 --> 01:04:21,275
He's gonna turn around.

1638
01:04:21,442 --> 01:04:22,568
Trust me.

1639
01:04:24,445 --> 01:04:25,947
Hope so.

1640
01:04:28,616 --> 01:04:31,118
<i>Unlike New York and LA,
there has been a spike</i>

1641
01:04:33,120 --> 01:04:35,581
<i>in the number of homicides
in Chicago in the last year.</i>

1642
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:38,209
You think anybody who's not
a regular will show up?

1643
01:04:38,376 --> 01:04:40,461
Yeah, everyone likes free shit.

1644
01:04:41,629 --> 01:04:43,756
That's not exactly what
we're doing this for though.

1645
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:45,609
You really think
the neighborhood's gonna agree

1646
01:04:45,633 --> 01:04:47,385
to be peaceful for two days?

1647
01:04:47,552 --> 01:04:49,762
I can't think of the last time
we went two hours

1648
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:51,973
without gunfire popping off around here.

1649
01:04:52,139 --> 01:04:54,141
We gonna make it happen this weekend.

1650
01:04:54,308 --> 01:04:55,935
So what? What happens after that?

1651
01:04:56,102 --> 01:04:57,812
The enclosure just magically stops?

1652
01:04:57,979 --> 01:05:01,649
Exactly. It ain't like politicians
really listen to the people anyway.

1653
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:03,126
<i>So we're gonna make them listen.</i>

1654
01:05:03,150 --> 01:05:06,112
The shop staying open
depends on the success of this ceasefire

1655
01:05:06,279 --> 01:05:07,405
and how much press we get.

1656
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:09,652
Check this out.
I already created a Twitter campaign.

1657
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:11,409
#BarbershopSavesTheNeighborhood.

1658
01:05:11,576 --> 01:05:13,953
Now, look, we get a few
celebrities to tweet that out,

1659
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,162
we'll go viral in no time.

1660
01:05:15,329 --> 01:05:16,330
I'll tell you what.

1661
01:05:16,497 --> 01:05:19,125
If you can get this to be
a trending topic on Twitter,

1662
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:20,602
I'll vote Democrat the next election.

1663
01:05:20,626 --> 01:05:21,627
Deal.

1664
01:05:21,794 --> 01:05:23,671
This just got very interesting.

1665
01:05:24,088 --> 01:05:25,464
- What up, everybody?
- Yo-yo.

1666
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,425
- Am I early or late?
- Both.

1667
01:05:27,592 --> 01:05:28,676
My man.

1668
01:05:32,179 --> 01:05:33,639
Come on.

1669
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:37,351
I don't think we should.
What do you think?

1670
01:05:38,185 --> 01:05:39,580
Made him get in the game injured, man.

1671
01:05:39,604 --> 01:05:41,522
That's why we
couldn't do nothing last week.

1672
01:05:41,689 --> 01:05:43,858
Head must tilt a certain way.

1673
01:05:44,108 --> 01:05:45,192
I'm just fond of shit.

1674
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:46,861
Uh, I like that.

1675
01:05:47,028 --> 01:05:48,904
<i>I'll set that down there.</i>

1676
01:05:49,071 --> 01:05:50,215
<i>Thank you! Appreciate it.</i>

1677
01:05:50,239 --> 01:05:52,366
<i>Thank you for the work.
Appreciate it.</i>

1678
01:06:05,379 --> 01:06:07,006
This is low as I can go really.

1679
01:06:07,173 --> 01:06:09,133
I can't go much lower than this now.

1680
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,510
- Is this decaf?
- Uh, yeah, cold brew's for me.

1681
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:12,720
Good looking out, A.

1682
01:06:12,887 --> 01:06:14,305
Yeah, no problem.

1683
01:06:15,181 --> 01:06:17,350
All right, my man. Thanks for coming.

1684
01:06:17,516 --> 01:06:18,796
- Yo, who next?
- I got you, Cal.

1685
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:28,402
There you go.

1686
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,571
<i>How is it out there?</i>

1687
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:33,032
Streets is quiet, feels good.

1688
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:35,177
It's actually starting to feel
a little normal.

1689
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,577
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

1690
01:06:36,911 --> 01:06:37,953
All right, ma.

1691
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,205
Bye, Anthony-Shmanthony.

1692
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:44,502
Girl, I know.

1693
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:47,981
That was probably crazy.

1694
01:06:48,005 --> 01:06:49,674
<i>Bitch, we've been in here 17 hours.</i>

1695
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,384
<i>You know, I am half delirious.</i>

1696
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:52,694
<i>Mmm-hmm.</i>

1697
01:06:52,718 --> 01:06:54,318
<i>So what'd he say?</i>

1698
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:56,430
Angie, do you wanna get that?

1699
01:06:59,266 --> 01:07:00,744
<i>- Stop, Tewana, stop!</i>
- What the fuck?

1700
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:02,019
I'm the owner today?

1701
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:05,940
Calvin's shop, Bree speaking.

1702
01:07:06,107 --> 01:07:07,501
<i>May I speak to Calvin, please?</i>

1703
01:07:07,525 --> 01:07:09,276
Yeah, one second. Calvin, it's for you.

1704
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,444
Who is it?

1705
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:12,613
I'm sorry, may I ask who's calling?

1706
01:07:12,780 --> 01:07:14,448
<i>- It's me, girl!</i>
- Oh.

1707
01:07:14,615 --> 01:07:17,118
Why you acting all business like?
It's One-Stop.

1708
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:20,955
I'll answer it in the back.

1709
01:07:22,498 --> 01:07:23,767
Yeah, he's gonna take it in the back.

1710
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:24,792
<i>Oh, it's like that?</i>

1711
01:07:24,959 --> 01:07:26,119
That's gross.

1712
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,634
Yo, Raja, let me get
some of that spray, G.

1713
01:07:33,801 --> 01:07:35,612
I had to get mine in the back,
like everybody else,

1714
01:07:35,636 --> 01:07:37,555
so what makes you so special, "G"?

1715
01:07:37,722 --> 01:07:39,522
- You a vic, man.
<i>- Say that to my face.</i>

1716
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:41,368
<i>Come on back and say it to my...
Don't! No, don't.</i>

1717
01:07:41,392 --> 01:07:42,768
No, no, stop being mean, Rashad.

1718
01:07:42,935 --> 01:07:44,145
<i>Stop!</i>

1719
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:46,147
Oh, shit!

1720
01:07:46,313 --> 01:07:48,315
- Shit! That's dope!
- Yeah!

1721
01:07:48,482 --> 01:07:50,526
- Yo, you...
- You hooked it up!

1722
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:53,070
One-Stop, why didn't you just
call me on my phone?

1723
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:55,799
<i>B, your cell number's
in my old phone. I got a new Galaxy.</i>

1724
01:07:55,823 --> 01:07:57,968
It isn't even out yet, man.
It's not even on the market.

1725
01:07:57,992 --> 01:07:59,076
People don't have it yet.

1726
01:07:59,243 --> 01:08:00,470
<i>Has everything on this bad boy...</i>

1727
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:02,496
Satellite radio, holographic video,

1728
01:08:02,663 --> 01:08:04,832
surround sound, 5G.

1729
01:08:04,999 --> 01:08:06,333
<i>Man, this phone is the only phone</i>

1730
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,061
<i>that's, like, five minutes
ahead of every call.</i>

1731
01:08:08,085 --> 01:08:09,646
So, I already talked to your ass already!

1732
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:11,672
- Dude, shut up!
<i>- It's crazy!</i>

1733
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:13,007
Damn. Now what's going on?

1734
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:15,277
Look, I got a Italian couple
here that's hot on this place.

1735
01:08:15,301 --> 01:08:16,302
<i>- They love it!</i>
- Who?

1736
01:08:16,469 --> 01:08:18,229
They wanna open a yogurt spot
or a yoga spot.

1737
01:08:18,345 --> 01:08:20,139
What's the issue? What'd you call me for?

1738
01:08:20,306 --> 01:08:21,307
Are we good or not?

1739
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:22,909
<i>Because if you're
thinking about backing out...</i>

1740
01:08:22,933 --> 01:08:24,327
I'm not thinking about backing out.

1741
01:08:24,351 --> 01:08:26,351
Now, I told you,
me and my wife, we want that shop.

1742
01:08:26,687 --> 01:08:29,482
All right, man<i>. Oui, oui.</i>
I'll see you Monday.

1743
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,192
And that's French.

1744
01:08:32,526 --> 01:08:33,819
Dumbass.

1745
01:08:39,784 --> 01:08:40,826
Hey, what's up?

1746
01:08:41,494 --> 01:08:42,536
What's up?

1747
01:08:43,162 --> 01:08:44,163
You good?

1748
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:46,540
I'm straight.

1749
01:08:58,219 --> 01:08:59,696
We rolling out
with the rest of the family

1750
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,013
from Holy City tomorrow.

1751
01:09:02,389 --> 01:09:03,557
Y'all still down, right?

1752
01:09:03,724 --> 01:09:05,226
<i>- Hell, yeah.</i>
- Yeah, probably.

1753
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:12,900
This nigga said probably?

1754
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:14,735
No, we down for sure.

1755
01:09:19,532 --> 01:09:20,991
Y'all little niggas better be.

1756
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:23,577
Because if you in this,
you in this for life.

1757
01:09:24,245 --> 01:09:26,705
But you know that, though, right, Kenny?

1758
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:29,250
Yeah, I know what's up.

1759
01:09:31,377 --> 01:09:32,586
Yeah, all right.

1760
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:34,588
We gonna see.

1761
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:39,878
I'm gonna give you the shake
tomorrow, too, youngster.

1762
01:09:40,219 --> 01:09:41,428
That's right.

1763
01:09:49,854 --> 01:09:50,855
I'm not stalking you,

1764
01:09:51,021 --> 01:09:53,482
I'm just getting something for my clients.

1765
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,235
Uh, Draya, I want to
talk to you anyway, 'cause...

1766
01:09:57,027 --> 01:09:58,404
You know what? The other night...

1767
01:09:58,571 --> 01:09:59,947
That was my fault.

1768
01:10:00,239 --> 01:10:01,448
I was tripping.

1769
01:10:01,782 --> 01:10:04,118
And I hope we good.

1770
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:08,372
I forgive you, Rashad.

1771
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,794
Hey, who wants some chicken wings?

1772
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:16,463
And I got some homemade banana pudding
from BJ's Market.

1773
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:17,756
Nice!

1774
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,885
Is this gluten-free, Terri?

1775
01:10:24,138 --> 01:10:25,264
Hey, what you doing now?

1776
01:10:25,431 --> 01:10:27,975
You're saying no,
but that's not what you mean, Rashad.

1777
01:10:28,142 --> 01:10:29,560
That is what I mean.

1778
01:10:29,727 --> 01:10:30,954
I knew I wasn't tripping the other night.

1779
01:10:30,978 --> 01:10:32,455
- No, you weren't.
- You tripping right now.

1780
01:10:32,479 --> 01:10:33,480
<i>Rashad!</i>

1781
01:10:36,775 --> 01:10:38,152
Shad, you back here?

1782
01:10:40,487 --> 01:10:41,572
Shad!

1783
01:10:44,408 --> 01:10:45,492
<i>Babe.</i>

1784
01:10:45,993 --> 01:10:47,578
Shad, you back here?

1785
01:10:47,745 --> 01:10:49,306
- You be quiet.
- You be quiet!

1786
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:50,331
No, no!

1787
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,791
<i>Where you at?</i>

1788
01:10:53,918 --> 01:10:55,252
Oh, man.

1789
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:56,962
Babe, you in the bathroom?

1790
01:11:21,362 --> 01:11:22,363
Hi, Terri.

1791
01:11:23,030 --> 01:11:24,865
No, baby. I'm tellin' you, we did nothing.

1792
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:26,426
- Get off me!
- There was nothing happening!

1793
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:27,493
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

1794
01:11:27,660 --> 01:11:29,012
- I need you to listen to me!
- Do not touch me!

1795
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:31,538
I'm listening, I'll listen!
I'll listen! I'm listening.

1796
01:11:31,705 --> 01:11:33,545
- It ain't what you think...
- Okay, all right!

1797
01:11:34,208 --> 01:11:35,542
Hey, what's going on?

1798
01:11:36,126 --> 01:11:38,295
<i>Draya, stop!
Calvin, help me on this!</i>

1799
01:11:38,462 --> 01:11:39,797
Get off me!

1800
01:11:40,798 --> 01:11:42,758
- Wait a minute!
- Let me get at her!

1801
01:11:42,925 --> 01:11:44,009
Get off me!

1802
01:11:44,176 --> 01:11:45,344
- Baby!
- Rashad, get off me!

1803
01:11:45,511 --> 01:11:46,696
<i>Baby, you gotta chill.
Nothing happened.</i>

1804
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,888
Calvin, help me!

1805
01:11:48,055 --> 01:11:49,223
World Star fight!

1806
01:11:49,390 --> 01:11:50,557
No, no World Star.

1807
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:51,952
I need you
to listen to me for a second.

1808
01:11:51,976 --> 01:11:53,018
Leave me alone!

1809
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,479
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1810
01:11:57,147 --> 01:11:59,191
Calm down. I need you to calm down.

1811
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:07,199
You ain't even worth it.

1812
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:18,919
Go get her.

1813
01:12:22,589 --> 01:12:23,590
<i>Cal,</i>

1814
01:12:23,757 --> 01:12:26,427
<i>do we still have those cameras
in the back?</i>

1815
01:12:26,719 --> 01:12:28,345
I told you not to take those down.

1816
01:12:28,512 --> 01:12:30,764
We could've had the shop's first sex tape.

1817
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:32,659
<i>- Whatever!
- Terri. Terri, come on.</i>

1818
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:33,827
- I know what I saw.
- Come on, Terri.

1819
01:12:33,851 --> 01:12:34,995
- Hey, Terri, come on.
- I know what I saw.

1820
01:12:35,019 --> 01:12:36,579
- I need you to talk to me.
- I knew it!

1821
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:37,872
- Whatever! I knew it.
- You have to listen to me.

1822
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:40,733
I knew it. I should've never trusted you
or that skank-ass ho!

1823
01:12:40,899 --> 01:12:43,944
Look, why would I mess around with Draya
in the same shop you work at?

1824
01:12:44,111 --> 01:12:45,338
- I'm smarter than that!
- Whatever!

1825
01:12:45,362 --> 01:12:46,442
I don't care what happened!

1826
01:12:46,572 --> 01:12:48,049
You should've never let it get that far.

1827
01:12:48,073 --> 01:12:49,616
You made her think she could!

1828
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,410
Why do you even talk to her anyway?

1829
01:12:51,744 --> 01:12:52,745
I don't know!

1830
01:12:52,911 --> 01:12:54,955
It's because... Look, she talked to me.

1831
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:56,623
You don't be talking to me, I talk!

1832
01:12:56,790 --> 01:12:58,910
She asked me how I'm doing,
she asked what's going on!

1833
01:12:58,959 --> 01:13:00,544
- Where you at?
- Where I'm at!

1834
01:13:00,711 --> 01:13:02,463
I'm working, for us, for our family!

1835
01:13:02,629 --> 01:13:04,882
This ain't about work,
I'm talking about us.

1836
01:13:05,049 --> 01:13:06,091
Me and you.

1837
01:13:06,258 --> 01:13:08,469
I'm talking about me and you for real.
Look at me.

1838
01:13:11,221 --> 01:13:12,639
Baby, look, look.

1839
01:13:13,432 --> 01:13:15,309
I tell you, you look beautiful every day.

1840
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:17,478
I say that because I mean it,

1841
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:19,563
and I want you to know that I see it,

1842
01:13:19,730 --> 01:13:21,482
because I love you, I care about you.

1843
01:13:22,232 --> 01:13:23,984
You sound like a real bitch right now.

1844
01:13:24,651 --> 01:13:27,321
Look, I ain't gonna be too many bitches.

1845
01:13:27,905 --> 01:13:28,906
Straight up.

1846
01:13:30,157 --> 01:13:31,837
Now, if you wanna have
a real conversation,

1847
01:13:31,992 --> 01:13:33,577
we have a real conversation.

1848
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:37,831
But you ain't gonna never
call me a bitch again.

1849
01:13:39,958 --> 01:13:42,669
I don't have nothing else to say to you.

1850
01:13:46,256 --> 01:13:47,424
I'm out.

1851
01:13:51,261 --> 01:13:52,304
Go on then.

1852
01:13:56,141 --> 01:13:57,267
Damn.

1853
01:13:57,434 --> 01:13:59,269
For all that, I should have smashed.

1854
01:14:04,525 --> 01:14:06,693
<i>Good afternoon, everybody!</i>

1855
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:08,671
<i>Folks coming home from church
are getting ready</i>

1856
01:14:08,695 --> 01:14:10,197
<i>for their Sunday dinner. Mmm!</i>

1857
01:14:10,364 --> 01:14:11,990
<i>It's a lazy quiet day...</i>

1858
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,301
<i>It's your girl, Terri. Leave it.</i>

1859
01:14:13,325 --> 01:14:14,511
<i>...and that's a good thing for once.</i>

1860
01:14:14,535 --> 01:14:16,930
<i>Stay with us, I got some of your requests
coming up momentarily.</i>

1861
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:18,594
<i>All right, I'm good. Thank you!</i>

1862
01:14:32,302 --> 01:14:33,637
You got something you wanna say?

1863
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:35,532
You know what,
women like you are the reason

1864
01:14:35,556 --> 01:14:37,516
why women like me
can't find a decent man.

1865
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:38,684
Excuse me?

1866
01:14:38,892 --> 01:14:40,052
Bree, this is not the time...

1867
01:14:40,102 --> 01:14:41,538
Don't be mad at me because you can't

1868
01:14:41,562 --> 01:14:43,230
- get a man or keep a man!
- Draya...

1869
01:14:43,397 --> 01:14:45,708
With all the single dudes in the world,
you just gotta be a married man's ho?

1870
01:14:45,732 --> 01:14:46,876
Is that your thing? Is that what you do?

1871
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:48,044
Yo, you better get your girl.

1872
01:14:48,068 --> 01:14:49,212
You just break up a healthy relationship?

1873
01:14:49,236 --> 01:14:50,380
You gotta get your girl.

1874
01:14:50,404 --> 01:14:51,756
- You better get her now!
- Ladies! Ladies, listen.

1875
01:14:51,780 --> 01:14:53,716
<i>- I'm dead serious.</i>
- Don't nobody wanna hear all that!

1876
01:14:53,740 --> 01:14:56,702
Now, if y'all wanna fight, fuss and cuss,
you take it to the back.

1877
01:14:56,869 --> 01:14:58,669
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Cal, this is not <i>Fight Club.</i>

1878
01:14:58,704 --> 01:15:00,515
You can't send ladies
to the back room to fight.

1879
01:15:00,539 --> 01:15:03,083
You gotta sign a waiver
and a release of liability.

1880
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,353
If they start fighting in that
back room and tear shit up,

1881
01:15:05,377 --> 01:15:06,420
<i>I'm telling you, man,</i>

1882
01:15:06,587 --> 01:15:08,857
<i>it's gonna come back on your insurance.
That's a deductible.</i>

1883
01:15:08,881 --> 01:15:10,817
And I do dental work, too,
if it gets out of hand.

1884
01:15:10,841 --> 01:15:11,842
<i>Okay, come see me.</i>

1885
01:15:12,009 --> 01:15:13,093
Man, shut up, One-Stop.

1886
01:15:13,385 --> 01:15:15,554
Look, I don't wanna take sides here,

1887
01:15:15,721 --> 01:15:17,764
but does anybody else here
see the hypocrisy

1888
01:15:17,931 --> 01:15:20,767
in always blaming
the single woman for the affair?

1889
01:15:20,934 --> 01:15:23,228
<i>I mean, let's be honest,
she wasn't the one</i>

1890
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:25,939
who swore to be honest and to be faithful

1891
01:15:26,106 --> 01:15:29,109
<i>and not cheat in the back room
of the barbershop</i>

1892
01:15:29,276 --> 01:15:31,111
until I'm dead. It was him.

1893
01:15:31,278 --> 01:15:33,947
How many times I gotta say
ain't nothing happened?

1894
01:15:34,114 --> 01:15:35,407
Yeah, nothing happened.

1895
01:15:35,574 --> 01:15:37,075
But I'm not gonna spend every day

1896
01:15:37,242 --> 01:15:40,871
explaining myself to you, you, or you!

1897
01:15:42,372 --> 01:15:44,625
Look, I'm just saying,
hypothetically, okay?

1898
01:15:44,791 --> 01:15:47,711
It is shameful society always
blames the other woman

1899
01:15:47,878 --> 01:15:49,296
when they should be blaming him.

1900
01:15:49,463 --> 01:15:50,631
<i>Listen, doofus...</i>

1901
01:15:50,797 --> 01:15:53,050
Monogamy doesn't run in our DNA.

1902
01:15:53,217 --> 01:15:54,801
- You understand that?
- What?

1903
01:15:54,968 --> 01:15:56,094
You can't defy science.

1904
01:15:56,261 --> 01:15:57,888
That is ridiculous, that is bullshit.

1905
01:15:58,055 --> 01:15:59,556
<i>Women want sex, too.</i>

1906
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:03,310
And you don't see us lying and cheating,
and going out buying sports cars.

1907
01:16:03,477 --> 01:16:05,312
You're just a weak-ass man, Dante.

1908
01:16:05,479 --> 01:16:06,813
Honestly, it's as simple as that.

1909
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:08,148
Yeah, okay and I'll be that.

1910
01:16:08,315 --> 01:16:11,818
A weak-ass man with a sports car
and a gaggle of bitches.

1911
01:16:12,194 --> 01:16:13,445
In real life.

1912
01:16:13,654 --> 01:16:15,530
Ew, y'all ain't shit, man.

1913
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:17,324
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, now, wait a minute.

1914
01:16:17,491 --> 01:16:19,326
Don't lump us all in there.

1915
01:16:19,493 --> 01:16:21,286
You know,
men aren't just looking to cheat.

1916
01:16:21,453 --> 01:16:24,456
That's like saying every woman
wants a big package.

1917
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:25,999
<i>Because it's just not true.</i>

1918
01:16:26,291 --> 01:16:28,335
They do, they all want a big package.

1919
01:16:28,502 --> 01:16:30,170
I know I do.

1920
01:16:30,337 --> 01:16:31,940
Honestly, I thought
that it was more about

1921
01:16:31,964 --> 01:16:34,341
passion and love, and, like,
how you guys connected...

1922
01:16:34,675 --> 01:16:35,759
<i>I mean, I have...</i>

1923
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,678
I believe he's gay.

1924
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:39,680
Like that? Like that?

1925
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:41,348
<i>I'm a real man.</i>

1926
01:16:41,515 --> 01:16:42,875
I don't feel like I need to cheat.

1927
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,226
Now that's just a lie.

1928
01:16:44,685 --> 01:16:46,496
<i>Because if Halle Berry came
walking in right now</i>

1929
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,040
and offered you them drawers,
you trying to tell me you wouldn't

1930
01:16:49,189 --> 01:16:50,833
take her in the back
and just bed her down?

1931
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,193
Hell, no. Halle Berry crazy as hell.

1932
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:54,861
From <i>Monster's Ball?</i>

1933
01:16:55,946 --> 01:16:59,199
"I want you to just make me feel good."

1934
01:16:59,366 --> 01:17:00,492
No.

1935
01:17:00,784 --> 01:17:02,160
You crazier than she is.

1936
01:17:03,161 --> 01:17:04,371
I like them crazy.

1937
01:17:04,538 --> 01:17:06,206
Like one-eye open crazy.

1938
01:17:06,373 --> 01:17:08,333
Like gotta hide your wallet crazy.

1939
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,668
Solange crazy.

1940
01:17:09,835 --> 01:17:11,503
Kick me, bitch, in the elevator.

1941
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:13,213
- Man, that's...
- Shut up!

1942
01:17:19,261 --> 01:17:21,430
I can't wait to give her this D.

1943
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:23,932
Ooh. He crazy there. This one.

1944
01:17:24,099 --> 01:17:25,183
Now that's dangerous.

1945
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:26,910
<i>Well, look, maybe it's just me.</i>

1946
01:17:27,060 --> 01:17:28,437
I'm a romantic.

1947
01:17:28,603 --> 01:17:29,883
One woman is good enough for me.

1948
01:17:30,022 --> 01:17:32,783
<i>Yeah, what's going on, everybody?
I wanna send a special shout-out</i>

1949
01:17:32,816 --> 01:17:34,085
<i>to Calvin's Barbershop
over on the South Side.</i>

1950
01:17:34,109 --> 01:17:35,110
Hey!

1951
01:17:35,277 --> 01:17:37,197
<i>They're right in the midst
of a 48-hour ceasefire</i>

1952
01:17:37,237 --> 01:17:39,031
<i>- to increase the peace.
- Doing it.</i>

1953
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:41,426
<i>- Keep it going, y'all.
- Hey, did y'all hear that?</i>

1954
01:17:41,450 --> 01:17:42,677
Did y'all hear my name on the radio?

1955
01:17:42,701 --> 01:17:44,501
- It's all right.
<i>- Did you hear that?</i>

1956
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:47,659
All right, that's dope, but it's still not
a trending topic on Twitter, okay?

1957
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:49,082
Don't matter.

1958
01:17:49,249 --> 01:17:51,251
- Because this is my shit.
- Mmm...

1959
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:52,711
What the hell are you doing?

1960
01:17:52,878 --> 01:17:55,756
I'm dancing, in a non-gay way.

1961
01:18:00,927 --> 01:18:01,928
Turn that up!

1962
01:18:09,436 --> 01:18:11,438
Bring it on, Eddie! Bring it on.

1963
01:18:14,066 --> 01:18:15,586
<i>Come on, girl!</i>

1964
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:23,492
Go, Calvin!

1965
01:18:59,945 --> 01:19:01,279
Rashad, baby!

1966
01:19:22,467 --> 01:19:23,510
Hey, what's up, Terrence?

1967
01:19:23,677 --> 01:19:27,055
Did you come to get a cut, man,
or are you here to see Eddie twerk?

1968
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:28,807
- No, no, no, no!
- You don't talk!

1969
01:19:28,974 --> 01:19:30,016
Come on, Eddie! Show him!

1970
01:19:30,183 --> 01:19:31,463
You know ain't I do no twerking!

1971
01:19:33,353 --> 01:19:35,188
<i>Eddie, come on, you can twerk.</i>

1972
01:19:36,648 --> 01:19:38,400
Uh, look, listen, guys, um...

1973
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,571
There was a shooting on 26th and King

1974
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:44,457
<i>- just a few minutes ago.</i>
- Oh, man! Really?

1975
01:19:45,866 --> 01:19:47,659
It was Anthony Clark.

1976
01:19:48,243 --> 01:19:50,078
- What?
- Wait, our Anthony?

1977
01:19:50,245 --> 01:19:51,413
<i>Oh, God.</i>

1978
01:19:57,919 --> 01:19:58,962
What happened?

1979
01:19:59,379 --> 01:20:00,857
He was walking home from the library.

1980
01:20:00,881 --> 01:20:02,048
<i>He died on the scene.</i>

1981
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:03,925
There was nothing any of us could do.

1982
01:20:06,219 --> 01:20:07,345
Oh, God.

1983
01:20:09,389 --> 01:20:10,469
<i>Calvin...</i>

1984
01:20:10,724 --> 01:20:12,564
<i>I didn't come here to bring
anybody down, okay?</i>

1985
01:20:13,518 --> 01:20:15,598
I'm really proud of the work
you guys are doing here.

1986
01:20:15,770 --> 01:20:17,331
<i>I mean, all the progress
you've made with the shop...</i>

1987
01:20:17,355 --> 01:20:18,732
Progress?

1988
01:20:19,566 --> 01:20:21,234
What progress, man?

1989
01:20:22,194 --> 01:20:24,112
I mean, what are you talking about?

1990
01:20:26,740 --> 01:20:28,074
A kid just died.

1991
01:20:28,241 --> 01:20:29,576
A mother's child...

1992
01:20:30,076 --> 01:20:32,245
A father's child is dead.

1993
01:20:32,412 --> 01:20:33,580
One of the best ones we got.

1994
01:20:34,206 --> 01:20:35,248
Yeah.

1995
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,918
That ain't no progress.

1996
01:20:38,627 --> 01:20:40,170
That's failure!

1997
01:20:41,546 --> 01:20:43,924
Nothing we've done has worked.

1998
01:20:44,090 --> 01:20:46,009
We just wasting our time.

1999
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,386
These kids ain't gonna listen to us.

2000
01:20:48,553 --> 01:20:50,764
These kids, they like to kill each other.

2001
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:52,432
<i>They like that shit.</i>

2002
01:20:52,599 --> 01:20:54,351
<i>We crazy to think that</i>

2003
01:20:54,518 --> 01:20:56,436
haircuts can stop bullets.

2004
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:59,231
Man, this is the fucking South Side.

2005
01:20:59,397 --> 01:21:02,067
This ceasefire shit is over. It's over.

2006
01:21:02,234 --> 01:21:03,443
Calvin, come on, now.

2007
01:21:03,610 --> 01:21:05,111
It's over, man!

2008
01:21:05,278 --> 01:21:06,404
Calvin.

2009
01:21:06,780 --> 01:21:08,716
Calvin, we made a commitment
to see this thing through.

2010
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:10,450
I don't give a damn about no commitment!

2011
01:21:10,617 --> 01:21:11,785
What commitment?

2012
01:21:12,118 --> 01:21:13,119
Huh?

2013
01:21:13,370 --> 01:21:15,010
The commitment of them
killing each other?

2014
01:21:16,456 --> 01:21:18,083
They ain't got no commitment to us!

2015
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:21,086
Look, I feel terrible about
what happened to Anthony.

2016
01:21:21,253 --> 01:21:22,295
We all do.

2017
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,631
That's the reason that
we have to keep going

2018
01:21:24,798 --> 01:21:25,966
now more than ever.

2019
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:28,885
How can you give up like this?

2020
01:21:29,052 --> 01:21:30,303
Because that's what he do.

2021
01:21:31,805 --> 01:21:33,056
He already had planned to

2022
01:21:33,223 --> 01:21:35,141
open up a shop on the North Side.

2023
01:21:35,308 --> 01:21:36,628
That's what he put money down on.

2024
01:21:39,896 --> 01:21:41,189
Is that right, Cal?

2025
01:21:41,648 --> 01:21:43,567
<i>You already plan to leave us behind.</i>

2026
01:21:45,318 --> 01:21:46,486
Calvin.

2027
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:51,408
Calvin, is that true?

2028
01:21:53,285 --> 01:21:54,869
Look.

2029
01:21:55,328 --> 01:21:56,413
I'm a father first.

2030
01:21:56,580 --> 01:21:57,581
Oh, my God.

2031
01:21:57,789 --> 01:21:59,666
Y'all gotta realize that. Okay?

2032
01:21:59,833 --> 01:22:00,959
I got a son, too, man.

2033
01:22:01,126 --> 01:22:03,169
Okay, you take care of yours,
I take care of mine.

2034
01:22:03,962 --> 01:22:05,839
Now y'all depend on me
to do a few things,

2035
01:22:06,006 --> 01:22:08,091
but Jalen depends on me to do everything.

2036
01:22:08,258 --> 01:22:10,176
And I'm not about to leave him out here

2037
01:22:10,343 --> 01:22:12,345
in these streets
to get hurt for you, you,

2038
01:22:12,512 --> 01:22:13,638
or this damn shop!

2039
01:22:13,805 --> 01:22:16,266
None of us have ever asked you
not to be a father!

2040
01:22:16,433 --> 01:22:17,934
None of us!

2041
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:21,354
We are here because of fathers
like you and sons like Jalen,

2042
01:22:21,521 --> 01:22:23,023
and you didn't even tell us?

2043
01:22:23,690 --> 01:22:26,943
We get up every single day
and we work beside you!

2044
01:22:27,861 --> 01:22:29,487
We're supposed to be your friends!

2045
01:22:31,281 --> 01:22:32,866
I am your partner!

2046
01:22:33,033 --> 01:22:34,492
<i>When were you gonna tell me?</i>

2047
01:22:34,659 --> 01:22:36,178
I was gonna say something
after the ceasefire.

2048
01:22:36,202 --> 01:22:38,242
- Man, that's bullshit.
- No, that's some real shit.

2049
01:22:38,288 --> 01:22:39,432
<i>You weren't gonna tell us</i>

2050
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:40,641
'cause you ain't care
about what we think.

2051
01:22:40,665 --> 01:22:42,500
- What?
- You sold us out, man.

2052
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:45,086
I didn't sell nobody out, man.
I've been here for years!

2053
01:22:45,629 --> 01:22:47,881
Y'all are the only reason
I come to this damn shop!

2054
01:22:48,048 --> 01:22:50,300
I've been wanting
to leave here years ago!

2055
01:22:50,800 --> 01:22:52,552
<i>I'm just trying to do better, man.</i>

2056
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:55,055
That's it! For my family!

2057
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:56,973
If you can't understand that, I'm sorry.

2058
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,225
- I'm sorry, but I'm out!
- Wait, Calvin. Come on.

2059
01:22:59,392 --> 01:23:00,786
- Let's talk...
- No. I'm gone. I'm out!

2060
01:23:00,810 --> 01:23:02,896
Calvin! Calvin?

2061
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:16,910
Thanks. Appreciate it.

2062
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:33,843
What do you say, Eugene?

2063
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:35,720
<i>Hey, hey, what's up, Big Eddie?</i>

2064
01:23:35,887 --> 01:23:37,698
Why don't you give me
a double shot of Hennessy?

2065
01:23:37,722 --> 01:23:39,766
- You got it, boss.
- Yep.

2066
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:42,894
You got some of those wasabi nuts?

2067
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:50,193
Eddie, if you came in here
on some <i>Ol' Man River</i> shit,

2068
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,960
trying to tell me what kind of fool I am

2069
01:23:52,112 --> 01:23:53,446
for moving the shop,

2070
01:23:53,613 --> 01:23:54,739
I don't want to hear it.

2071
01:23:55,115 --> 01:23:58,284
Well, I might as well just
take my drink to go then.

2072
01:23:58,451 --> 01:24:00,912
Go on. Put that in a plastic cup.

2073
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:05,083
I'm gonna be real with you, Cal.

2074
01:24:05,917 --> 01:24:07,711
I came in here to say,

2075
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:09,254
thank you.

2076
01:24:10,130 --> 01:24:13,258
Now, I ain't want
to say this in front of everybody,

2077
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:14,592
but you right.

2078
01:24:14,759 --> 01:24:17,971
Selling the shop is the best
thing for your family,

2079
01:24:18,138 --> 01:24:20,598
and the perfect excuse for me to get out.

2080
01:24:20,765 --> 01:24:21,975
Go on and retire.

2081
01:24:22,475 --> 01:24:24,436
Retire? You?

2082
01:24:25,937 --> 01:24:28,148
Thought you'd die before
you left that shop, Eddie.

2083
01:24:28,314 --> 01:24:29,441
Yeah.

2084
01:24:29,607 --> 01:24:33,570
I ain't dying in that old
raggedy-ass unisexual shop.

2085
01:24:33,737 --> 01:24:34,821
What...

2086
01:24:34,988 --> 01:24:37,073
I can't even recognize
that place no more.

2087
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:38,241
Hell...

2088
01:24:38,408 --> 01:24:40,827
I don't even recognize
the neighborhood no more.

2089
01:24:40,994 --> 01:24:42,328
Yeah.

2090
01:24:43,329 --> 01:24:44,914
Got that right.

2091
01:24:45,457 --> 01:24:47,250
All the more reason

2092
01:24:47,584 --> 01:24:50,587
for you to just go on over
there to the North Side.

2093
01:24:58,636 --> 01:24:59,916
I know what you're doing, Eddie.

2094
01:25:01,014 --> 01:25:02,682
It's not easy, man.

2095
01:25:02,849 --> 01:25:05,351
Hell, no, it ain't easy. Hell, no.

2096
01:25:06,186 --> 01:25:08,438
We black. It's hard.

2097
01:25:08,605 --> 01:25:11,316
Hard and us go hand in hand.

2098
01:25:11,858 --> 01:25:13,610
But we ain't never gave up.

2099
01:25:13,985 --> 01:25:15,195
I didn't give up.

2100
01:25:15,779 --> 01:25:17,030
I gave out.

2101
01:25:17,947 --> 01:25:19,324
I'm tired, Eddie.

2102
01:25:20,784 --> 01:25:22,118
I'm tired, too.

2103
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,037
We've been up 38 hours.

2104
01:25:34,214 --> 01:25:35,840
Anthony's gone.

2105
01:25:38,343 --> 01:25:40,053
And that hurts like hell.

2106
01:25:40,804 --> 01:25:45,517
But we done lost a whole bunch more
if we didn't do that ceasefire.

2107
01:25:46,226 --> 01:25:47,852
Now we lost one.

2108
01:25:48,561 --> 01:25:50,063
He was special.

2109
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:54,567
But we probably saved
more lives than we know.

2110
01:25:54,734 --> 01:25:58,571
And for that reason alone is
reason to keep up the fight.

2111
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:06,830
- What's good, bro?
- Yo.

2112
01:26:08,748 --> 01:26:09,749
I can't do this, man.

2113
01:26:09,916 --> 01:26:10,917
What?

2114
01:26:11,084 --> 01:26:12,210
I gotta walk away.

2115
01:26:12,377 --> 01:26:14,188
So you just gonna leave me
out here with Yummy alone?

2116
01:26:14,212 --> 01:26:16,172
I ain't leave you nowhere, man.

2117
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:17,619
You ain't got to do this either.

2118
01:26:17,924 --> 01:26:19,484
Can't believe you doing this to me, yo.

2119
01:26:20,927 --> 01:26:21,928
What?

2120
01:26:22,095 --> 01:26:24,848
Look, my dad let me move
in with him and Terri.

2121
01:26:25,014 --> 01:26:26,174
They've been real cool to me.

2122
01:26:26,224 --> 01:26:27,559
I don't want to hear that, man.

2123
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,102
J, what are you thinking?

2124
01:26:29,561 --> 01:26:31,104
I mean, look at what you have here.

2125
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:32,939
Everything you need is right here.

2126
01:26:33,106 --> 01:26:35,441
You got a moms, you got a dad.

2127
01:26:35,650 --> 01:26:36,943
I'm not doing this.

2128
01:26:37,235 --> 01:26:39,279
If you were smart, you'd do the same.

2129
01:26:58,256 --> 01:26:59,591
Do I need to check the closet?

2130
01:27:00,925 --> 01:27:02,385
You been gone all of this time,

2131
01:27:02,552 --> 01:27:04,470
<i>ain't answered none of my messages</i>

2132
01:27:04,637 --> 01:27:06,431
and you come here playing.

2133
01:27:11,227 --> 01:27:12,645
I'm sorry.

2134
01:27:14,314 --> 01:27:15,440
I don't wanna fight.

2135
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:20,486
With everything going on
right now, with Anthony,

2136
01:27:21,154 --> 01:27:22,614
<i>we shouldn't be like this.</i>

2137
01:27:23,406 --> 01:27:24,574
I agree.

2138
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,829
And I'm sorry about that Draya mess.

2139
01:27:29,996 --> 01:27:31,581
Nothing happened.

2140
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:33,881
But I shouldn't have
put you in that position.

2141
01:27:36,002 --> 01:27:37,503
I know nothing happened.

2142
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,964
You're just an idiot.

2143
01:27:42,008 --> 01:27:43,801
I'm just a man, baby.

2144
01:27:45,178 --> 01:27:46,679
I get it.

2145
01:27:48,014 --> 01:27:50,183
And I know I've been working a lot.

2146
01:27:52,685 --> 01:27:54,771
But I need you to know

2147
01:27:56,189 --> 01:27:58,274
that I see everything you do.

2148
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:02,028
You're an amazing man, Rashad.

2149
01:28:02,195 --> 01:28:04,197
You're an amazing father to Maya.

2150
01:28:05,114 --> 01:28:07,951
I could never ask for
a better partner than you.

2151
01:28:09,619 --> 01:28:11,537
I guess I just figured

2152
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:14,707
you knew how I felt.

2153
01:28:15,208 --> 01:28:16,376
I do.

2154
01:28:17,377 --> 01:28:19,712
But sometimes a brother needs to hear it.

2155
01:28:22,799 --> 01:28:24,509
One-Stop, can you sign this?

2156
01:28:24,676 --> 01:28:26,386
No doubt.

2157
01:28:26,552 --> 01:28:28,888
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

2158
01:28:30,306 --> 01:28:31,975
<i>Oh, this is crazy, man.</i>

2159
01:28:32,141 --> 01:28:34,060
<i>Bree, you wanna sign the card?</i>

2160
01:28:34,227 --> 01:28:35,895
<i>Yo, Jerrod, check it out.</i>

2161
01:28:38,231 --> 01:28:40,066
<i>Hey, what's up, everybody?</i>

2162
01:28:40,233 --> 01:28:42,235
Before y'all pack up your stuff,

2163
01:28:42,402 --> 01:28:44,237
<i>can I talk to you for a minute?</i>

2164
01:28:48,199 --> 01:28:49,742
Just real quick.

2165
01:28:53,913 --> 01:28:56,541
Go on in now, say what you gotta say.

2166
01:28:59,877 --> 01:29:01,254
I was wrong.

2167
01:29:03,423 --> 01:29:05,717
<i>The reason I wanted to end the ceasefire</i>

2168
01:29:06,342 --> 01:29:09,512
is the same reason why I
wanted to move the shop to the North Side.

2169
01:29:11,764 --> 01:29:13,349
Man, I was hurt.

2170
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:15,768
Disappointed.

2171
01:29:17,937 --> 01:29:19,605
<i>But y'all know me.</i>

2172
01:29:20,356 --> 01:29:22,942
Y'all know I got love for the South Side.

2173
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:28,197
I got love for everybody
in this neighborhood.

2174
01:29:29,741 --> 01:29:32,118
I got love for everybody in here.

2175
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,620
<i>All my customers,</i>

2176
01:29:35,455 --> 01:29:37,915
even the ones that don't know
how to go home.

2177
01:29:42,170 --> 01:29:43,171
What?

2178
01:29:44,255 --> 01:29:45,715
Are y'all gonna play me like that?

2179
01:29:47,133 --> 01:29:49,135
So after a while, it just...

2180
01:29:49,302 --> 01:29:51,929
It just became easier to just walk away.

2181
01:29:52,722 --> 01:29:54,432
<i>Walk away from all this pain.</i>

2182
01:29:55,433 --> 01:29:56,934
All the hurt.

2183
01:29:59,145 --> 01:30:00,646
That ain't right either.

2184
01:30:01,731 --> 01:30:04,734
<i>If we don't do something for
this neighborhood, who will?</i>

2185
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:07,653
<i>At the end of the day
we can't expect people</i>

2186
01:30:08,279 --> 01:30:10,990
who don't know nothing about
what's going on around here,

2187
01:30:11,157 --> 01:30:13,910
to come in here and solve our problems.

2188
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:18,122
We gotta fix our problems ourself.

2189
01:30:19,957 --> 01:30:21,834
So what are you saying, Calvin?

2190
01:30:22,627 --> 01:30:24,837
I'm saying I wanna continue
what we started.

2191
01:30:25,338 --> 01:30:28,174
<i>I want to put the ceasefire
back on for the neighborhood.</i>

2192
01:30:28,341 --> 01:30:29,801
For Anthony...

2193
01:30:31,469 --> 01:30:32,845
And really for us.

2194
01:30:33,346 --> 01:30:36,516
<i>But I'm only one half
of the leadership here, so,</i>

2195
01:30:36,682 --> 01:30:38,851
I'm gonna need the support of my partner

2196
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:41,854
before the ceasefire's
officially back on.

2197
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:43,815
Calvin, you never lost my support.

2198
01:30:43,981 --> 01:30:44,982
You know, I'm here.

2199
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:47,193
<i>I appreciate your vote of confidence,</i>

2200
01:30:47,360 --> 01:30:48,760
but I think Angie is the one you...

2201
01:30:48,861 --> 01:30:50,196
Shh! You're good. You're good.

2202
01:30:50,363 --> 01:30:52,723
- Oh, Angie is the one you're speaking to.
- Now you got it.

2203
01:30:52,782 --> 01:30:54,534
<i>I totally misread the situation.</i>

2204
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:55,743
<i>It's okay.</i>

2205
01:30:56,702 --> 01:30:58,204
So what you say, Ange?

2206
01:30:59,539 --> 01:31:00,706
Look...

2207
01:31:04,544 --> 01:31:05,586
<i>I just...</i>

2208
01:31:07,213 --> 01:31:10,216
I just can't understand why people
are still standing around

2209
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:12,718
when my partner just said
the ceasefire is back on.

2210
01:31:14,220 --> 01:31:15,721
<i>Yes!</i>

2211
01:31:16,389 --> 01:31:17,640
<i>Ooh, bait and switch.</i>

2212
01:31:17,807 --> 01:31:19,267
Thank you so much.

2213
01:31:20,393 --> 01:31:21,769
- All right.
<i>- Let's do this.</i>

2214
01:31:21,978 --> 01:31:22,979
<i>Oh, yes, yes!</i>

2215
01:31:23,146 --> 01:31:26,149
<i>- That's good stuff right there.</i>
- Yes, sir. Good stuff.

2216
01:31:26,315 --> 01:31:27,567
- Sorry about that.
- Nah.

2217
01:31:27,775 --> 01:31:28,985
<i>Let's celebrate!</i>

2218
01:31:29,986 --> 01:31:31,737
Yo. Can a brother get a cut around here?

2219
01:31:32,697 --> 01:31:33,698
Damn!

2220
01:31:33,865 --> 01:31:35,199
Hey, D, what's up, man?

2221
01:31:35,366 --> 01:31:37,446
<i>- How you doing?
- Doing good now.</i>

2222
01:31:37,660 --> 01:31:39,888
I'm Calvin. This is my shop, man.
What can we do for you?

2223
01:31:39,912 --> 01:31:40,952
Playing the Bulls tomorrow

2224
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,040
and got a tweet from somebody
named thottiepimpin

2225
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:45,007
about what y'all are doing
here and everything

2226
01:31:45,084 --> 01:31:46,228
and just came here
to show my support, man.

2227
01:31:46,252 --> 01:31:47,253
Cool.

2228
01:31:47,420 --> 01:31:48,588
Who's thottiepimpin?

2229
01:31:48,754 --> 01:31:49,922
That one right there.

2230
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:51,174
What's up, man?

2231
01:31:51,340 --> 01:31:52,884
- How you doing, man?
- I'm doing.

2232
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,927
- Just a second.
- You all right?

2233
01:31:55,094 --> 01:31:56,429
You okay?

2234
01:31:56,596 --> 01:31:58,431
Sorry, A.D. Sorry. He's got issues.

2235
01:31:58,598 --> 01:31:59,765
This was a mercy hire.

2236
01:31:59,932 --> 01:32:01,267
Just give the man some space.

2237
01:32:01,434 --> 01:32:03,227
- Hey. How ya doing?
- What's up, man?

2238
01:32:03,394 --> 01:32:04,580
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.

2239
01:32:04,604 --> 01:32:06,772
- All right, bro. Keep growing.
- High five.

2240
01:32:07,356 --> 01:32:08,524
Okay, come on, young man.

2241
01:32:09,025 --> 01:32:10,610
Sit on down. Come on in here.

2242
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:12,904
Let me line that unibrow a little.

2243
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,113
Give it a soft fade,

2244
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:15,716
and then I'll cut
right through the middle there

2245
01:32:15,740 --> 01:32:16,782
and open it up for you.

2246
01:32:17,617 --> 01:32:18,951
Nobody's touching my unibrow.

2247
01:32:19,118 --> 01:32:20,286
And no disrespect,

2248
01:32:20,453 --> 01:32:22,014
I'm gonna let my man
Calvin over here hook me up.

2249
01:32:22,038 --> 01:32:23,348
<i>- All right.
- What's up, A.D.?</i>

2250
01:32:23,372 --> 01:32:24,516
How you doing, brother? You good?

2251
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:25,767
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
- Everything all right?

2252
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,627
All right. Question...

2253
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:29,605
- You looking for a roommate?
- No, I'm all good, man.

2254
01:32:29,629 --> 01:32:30,963
- You sure?
- Positive.

2255
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:32,381
I got my stuff. I'm all ready.

2256

<i>We ain't got to make a stop or nothing.</i>

2257
01:32:33,925 --> 01:32:35,569
- All right. Cool, man.
- I'm good. I'm good.

2258
01:32:35,593 --> 01:32:36,969
- You say yes?
- No, I said...

2259
01:32:37,136 --> 01:32:38,447
All right. Okay. All right, okay. Cool.

2260
01:32:38,471 --> 01:32:39,847
Don't do it.

2261
01:32:40,014 --> 01:32:41,200
- Sorry about that, man.
- It's all good, man.

2262
01:32:41,224 --> 01:32:42,451
- You know how they act.
- Yeah.

2263
01:32:42,475 --> 01:32:43,869
Question. You mind if
I get a picture for Twitter?

2264
01:32:43,893 --> 01:32:44,894
Yeah, for sure, man.

2265
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:46,288
Tag me in it, too, so I can retweet it.

2266
01:32:46,312 --> 01:32:49,232
Man! That would be...
That would be dope, man.

2267
01:32:49,398 --> 01:32:50,399
Hey, man, hurry up.

2268

Let me get this photo.

2270
01:32:53,861 --> 01:32:55,154
Damn, you're like TMZ.

2271
01:32:57,448 --> 01:32:58,800
I appreciate you coming through here.

2272
01:32:58,824 --> 01:33:00,302
- They gonna go crazy.
- Yeah, I appreciate it.

2273
01:33:00,326 --> 01:33:02,554
Don't worry about nothing, man.
Your unibrow is safe with me.

2274
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:03,858
- I appreciate that, man.

01:35:06,827 --> 01:35:08,454
<i>Oh, they're here to accept the money--</i>

2328
01:35:08,621 --> 01:35:10,456
<i>Shut up, woman!
I heard you the first time!</i>

2329
01:35:10,623 --> 01:35:12,059
<i>Ain't nobody said they was
gonna give no money</i>

2330
01:35:12,083 --> 01:35:13,959
<i>to no Boys and Girl-- Oh!</i>

2331
01:35:14,126 --> 01:35:16,629
<i>Boys and Girls Club. Yeah.</i>

2332
01:35:16,796 --> 01:35:19,465
<i>Okay, hold on one second, chrome dome.
All right.</i>

2333
01:35:20,132 --> 01:35:22,760
<i>Live from the South Side,
I am Candace Washington...</i>

2334
01:35:23,928 --> 01:35:25,596
I need your help. It's Jalen.

2335
01:35:25,763 --> 01:35:27,282
- What's going on with Jalen?
- He's about to do this

2336
01:35:27,306 --> 01:35:28,546
initiation with the Vice Lords.

2337
01:35:28,641 --> 01:35:29,785
Look, I tried to tell him not to.

2338
01:35:29,809 --> 01:35:31,018
Where's he at, Kenny?

2339
01:35:31,185 --> 01:35:32,865
He's at the park.
Cornell Square.

2340
01:35:33,312 --> 01:35:34,480
Cal!

2341
01:35:34,980 --> 01:35:36,982
Hell, yeah,
that's what I like to hear.

2342
01:35:37,149 --> 01:35:39,151
You all ready? You all ready?

2343
01:35:39,985 --> 01:35:41,153
Yeah.

2344
01:35:42,196 --> 01:35:43,322
What's up, man?

2345
01:35:44,657 --> 01:35:45,991
Where your little homie Kenny at?

2346
01:35:47,952 --> 01:35:50,112
I don't know.
I think his dad said he had to come home.

2347
01:35:50,496 --> 01:35:52,623
Stay home? You playing, right?

2348
01:35:53,290 --> 01:35:54,583
Stay home?

2349
01:35:55,376 --> 01:35:57,002
You think this a joke?

2350
01:35:58,462 --> 01:36:00,172
You think this is a game, nigga?

2351
01:36:02,383 --> 01:36:03,777
<i>We're concerned about the people</i>

2352
01:36:03,801 --> 01:36:05,278
<i>that Jalen's been hanging around with.</i>

2353
01:36:05,302 --> 01:36:07,030
<i>Are you trying
to say Jalen's in a gang?</i>

2354
01:36:07,054 --> 01:36:08,698
Not trying to get that call
in the middle of the night

2355
01:36:08,722 --> 01:36:10,683
saying my son is locked up or worse,

2356
01:36:10,850 --> 01:36:13,227
<i>because we didn't act
when we had a chance.</i>

2357
01:36:13,394 --> 01:36:14,979
See, that's the problem right there.

2358
01:36:15,312 --> 01:36:16,981
Everybody wanna be down,

2359
01:36:17,148 --> 01:36:19,191
nobody want to put in the work.

2360
01:36:19,859 --> 01:36:21,444
Didn't Quis say to chill this weekend?

2361
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:24,613
Nigga. Marquis?

2362
01:36:25,990 --> 01:36:27,533
Nigga, I ain't worried about Marquis.

2363
01:36:28,576 --> 01:36:30,016
Know what? You playing me right now.

2364
01:36:30,077 --> 01:36:31,412
You wasting my time right now.

2365
01:36:32,037 --> 01:36:33,706
I think he wasting my time.

2366
01:36:35,749 --> 01:36:37,168
Ain't no going home, nigga.

2367
01:36:37,334 --> 01:36:38,836
Ain't no such thing.

2368
01:36:39,003 --> 01:36:40,147
<i>Why are you
trying to take everything</i>

2369
01:36:40,171 --> 01:36:41,565
<i>- I like away from me?
- Because I love you...</i>

2370
01:36:41,589 --> 01:36:42,983
<i>My life would be
so much better if you...</i>

2371
01:36:43,007 --> 01:36:44,287
<i>We raised a smart kid.</i>

2372
01:36:44,383 --> 01:36:45,503
You need to make a decision.

2373
01:36:46,844 --> 01:36:49,221
Are you riding or not?

2374
01:37:37,269 --> 01:37:40,147
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

2375
01:37:40,314 --> 01:37:43,108
seven, six, five,

2376
01:37:43,275 --> 01:37:46,278
four, three, two...

2377
01:37:46,445 --> 01:37:47,738
One!

2378
01:37:47,905 --> 01:37:49,615
Yeah!

2379
01:37:53,369 --> 01:37:54,969
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

2380
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:56,664
<i>Yeah, baby! All right!</i>

2381
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:03,420
Ah! Ah! Ah!

2382
01:38:03,629 --> 01:38:04,773
- Bam!
- Your daddy gonna be proud.

2383
01:38:04,797 --> 01:38:06,117
Your dad will be so proud of you.

2384
01:38:06,257 --> 01:38:07,400
- You did a good job.
- I feel good.

2385
01:38:07,424 --> 01:38:08,467
I feel good.

2386
01:38:09,969 --> 01:38:11,929
Hey, yo, Shad. Hey, man!

2387
01:38:12,137 --> 01:38:14,306
Much love, dude.
I'm sorry about everything.

2388
01:38:14,473 --> 01:38:16,850
- I love you, boy.
- I love you, bro. Love you.

2389
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:18,310
Wow.

2390
01:38:18,519 --> 01:38:20,479
Two black dads getting along.

2391
01:38:30,823 --> 01:38:31,865
Let me ask you something.

2392
01:38:32,074 --> 01:38:35,160
Um, I don't come off as gay, do I?

2393
01:38:35,327 --> 01:38:38,038
I mean, I've heard that,
like, twice already today.

2394
01:38:38,205 --> 01:38:40,374
No.
Now, do I think that you could

2395
01:38:40,541 --> 01:38:43,627
maybe afford to own one less
pastel-colored T-shirt

2396
01:38:43,794 --> 01:38:45,355
and go up a size in the jean department?

2397
01:38:45,379 --> 01:38:46,880
Yes, absolutely.

2398
01:38:47,047 --> 01:38:48,507
But who cares?

2399
01:38:48,674 --> 01:38:50,509
Clothes don't signify someone's sexuality.

2400
01:38:50,676 --> 01:38:52,177
And even if you were gay...

2401
01:38:52,344 --> 01:38:54,888
I'm not. For the record. I'm not.

2402
01:38:55,055 --> 01:38:57,224
It wouldn't matter to me anyway.

2403
01:38:57,391 --> 01:39:00,519
I like who you are and you shouldn't feel
pressured to change for anybody.

2404
01:39:00,728 --> 01:39:02,688
And there's no rules on
how to be a straight dude.

2405
01:39:02,855 --> 01:39:03,856
Look at Miguel.

2406
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,149
Look at Prince.

2407
01:39:05,316 --> 01:39:07,693
Homeboy be rocking
six-inch stilettos and a perm,

2408
01:39:07,860 --> 01:39:08,861
and he can still get it.

2409
01:39:09,028 --> 01:39:10,029
Yes, he can.

2410
01:39:11,238 --> 01:39:13,073
I'm messing with you.
Playing the whole...

2411
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:14,533
- That's...
- Anyway.

2412
01:39:15,868 --> 01:39:17,786
So, you like my personality?

2413
01:39:19,163 --> 01:39:22,041
What can I say?
I find your neuroses entertaining.

2414
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:25,711
Your passion for
women's rights liberating.

2415
01:39:26,253 --> 01:39:27,254
And, um...

2416
01:39:29,632 --> 01:39:31,258
I find your nerdiness

2417
01:39:31,425 --> 01:39:33,218
incredibly sexy.

2418
01:39:36,096 --> 01:39:37,181
Wow.

2419
01:39:38,265 --> 01:39:39,892
Talking to me?

2420
01:39:40,351 --> 01:39:41,894
And that's why I like you.

2421
01:39:42,061 --> 01:39:43,062
Because you get me.

2422
01:39:43,562 --> 01:39:46,190
Not a lot of people do,
but you definitely do.

2423
01:39:46,357 --> 01:39:48,734
And just so you know, Ronnie, your ex,

2424
01:39:48,901 --> 01:39:51,403
he was never good enough for you.

2425
01:40:03,415 --> 01:40:04,792
I think I'm in love with you.

2426
01:40:04,958 --> 01:40:07,252
And I want to shout it from the rooftops.

2427
01:40:07,878 --> 01:40:09,588
- Oh... Too soon?
- Yeah.

2428
01:40:09,797 --> 01:40:11,477
- That's what I thought.
- Yeah.

2429
01:40:11,590 --> 01:40:13,759
I mean... What'd you hear?
You heard that I said

2430
01:40:13,926 --> 01:40:15,761
- I was in love with you?
- No.

2431
01:40:16,053 --> 01:40:17,054
Rewind that.

2432
01:40:17,221 --> 01:40:18,365
How about dinner tomorrow night?

2433
01:40:18,389 --> 01:40:19,429
- Okay.
- That makes sense.

2434
01:40:19,556 --> 01:40:20,557
Yeah. That's...

2435
01:40:20,766 --> 01:40:22,366
I went from a broken home,

2436
01:40:22,393 --> 01:40:24,645
- so I give affection very fast.
- Oh, my Lord. My Lord.

2437
01:40:24,812 --> 01:40:26,480
Yeah. Yeah.

2438
01:40:28,440 --> 01:40:30,067
You got a lot of nerve showing up here.

2439
01:40:30,609 --> 01:40:32,945
- I came to apologize, Terri.
- I don't want to hear it.

2440
01:40:33,112 --> 01:40:34,738
Well, I wanna say it anyway.

2441
01:40:37,741 --> 01:40:39,868
Listen, I'm really sorry.

2442
01:40:40,577 --> 01:40:42,457
I should have never come
between you and Rashad.

2443
01:40:42,579 --> 01:40:43,914
Damn right.

2444
01:40:44,164 --> 01:40:46,625
It's just that you have your
whole life taken care of,

2445
01:40:46,792 --> 01:40:48,419
and figured out. And...

2446
01:40:48,961 --> 01:40:51,672
I'm like, still trying to figure out
every little thing about mine.

2447
01:40:53,298 --> 01:40:55,008
I made a mistake.

2448
01:40:55,175 --> 01:40:57,803
It'll never, ever happen again.
I promise you that.

2449
01:40:59,096 --> 01:41:00,305
Well...

2450
01:41:01,348 --> 01:41:02,975
I appreciate you saying that.

2451
01:41:03,308 --> 01:41:05,436
Does that mean we're cool?

2452
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:08,355
I guess.

2453
01:41:08,605 --> 01:41:09,648
Come here, girl!

2454
01:41:13,444 --> 01:41:14,445
Anyway...

2455
01:41:14,611 --> 01:41:17,156
I did want to tell you
that if you and Rashad

2456
01:41:17,322 --> 01:41:19,616
was looking for, like,
a third girl to help you out,

2457
01:41:19,783 --> 01:41:21,660
you know, get it poppin'
or anything like that,

2458
01:41:21,827 --> 01:41:23,036
I would be down for that.

2459
01:41:23,287 --> 01:41:24,496
Mull it over.

2460
01:41:24,788 --> 01:41:25,789
- Bye, Draya.
- Hey, hey.

2461
01:41:25,956 --> 01:41:27,040
Hey, hey, hey.

2462
01:41:27,207 --> 01:41:28,876
We need to at least hear her out now.

2463
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:30,794
I mean, she ain't
come this way for nothing.

2464
01:41:30,961 --> 01:41:32,605
- Hey, Rashad!
<i>- What's good, Draya?</i>

2465
01:41:32,629 --> 01:41:33,669
- Get in the house.
- Baby.

2466
01:41:33,797 --> 01:41:35,597
<i>You think it's funny.
You're not funny.</i>

2467
01:41:35,674 --> 01:41:36,834
Thanks.

2468
01:41:38,510 --> 01:41:40,679
This is not what you think it is.

2469
01:41:41,513 --> 01:41:43,393
This is that bird I talked about.
Remember that?

2470
01:41:43,474 --> 01:41:44,475
It went away.

2471
01:41:46,018 --> 01:41:48,187
It flew away. Let 'em fly.

2472
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:54,818
Know why I came back?

2473
01:41:54,985 --> 01:41:56,695
- Why?
- Because you my man.

2474
01:41:57,154 --> 01:41:58,238
I came back to you.

2475
01:41:58,530 --> 01:42:00,133
Why don't you just give me the damn check?

2476
01:42:00,157 --> 01:42:01,200
My man.

2477
01:42:01,408 --> 01:42:02,493
That's your section.

2478
01:42:02,659 --> 01:42:04,161
- No booth rent.
- We're clear?

2479
01:42:04,328 --> 01:42:05,329
Do you.

2480
01:42:05,496 --> 01:42:06,936
My man. It's a pleasure, my brother.

2481
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:08,665
<i>You will do good business, my brother.</i>

2482
01:42:08,832 --> 01:42:10,042
You have a good day!

2483
01:42:10,209 --> 01:42:12,085
Hit these streets. Oh! Hey! Hey!

2484
01:42:12,252 --> 01:42:15,005
I need to talk to you.
You got to sign some paperwork, brother.

2485
01:42:15,172 --> 01:42:16,715
<i>Your wife trying to find you.</i>

2486
01:42:16,882 --> 01:42:18,675
<i>You're gonna run from me, really?</i>

2487
01:42:22,179 --> 01:42:23,597
Yo, man, we closed.

2488
01:42:23,764 --> 01:42:24,890
Come back tomorrow.

2489
01:42:25,057 --> 01:42:26,558
Man, that's too bad.

2490
01:42:29,394 --> 01:42:31,563
I was really hoping you could fit me in.

2491
01:42:33,398 --> 01:42:35,067
I think I got room for one more.

2492
01:42:40,739 --> 01:42:42,241
Have a seat.

2493
01:42:47,246 --> 01:42:49,331
Glad you came, man.

2494
01:42:49,581 --> 01:42:52,751
Just wanted to do something about this
so-called abomination you say.

2495
01:42:54,086 --> 01:42:55,963
I'll hook you up,
don't worry about nothin'.

2496
01:42:56,213 --> 01:42:58,215
Edge you up real quick.

2497
01:42:58,757 --> 01:43:01,093
Uh... I was thinking,

2498
01:43:01,301 --> 01:43:02,761
start off fresh.

2499
01:43:08,267 --> 01:43:09,309
You sure?

2500
01:43:10,561 --> 01:43:11,562
Positive.

2501
01:43:13,438 --> 01:43:14,439
All right.

2502
01:43:14,606 --> 01:43:15,899
Start you off fresh.

2503
01:43:17,150 --> 01:43:19,278
You know, I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

2504
01:43:20,279 --> 01:43:22,447
You've always been there
for me for everything,

2505
01:43:22,614 --> 01:43:23,991
and I appreciate it.

2506
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:27,452
Love you, Dad.

2507
01:43:28,453 --> 01:43:29,872
I love you, too, man.

2508
01:43:30,622 --> 01:43:31,999
Always gonna be my guy.

2509
01:43:32,249 --> 01:43:33,333
I swear.

2510
01:43:34,960 --> 01:43:38,171
All right. Let's see how
we can hook you up here.

2511
01:43:39,172 --> 01:43:40,632
Yeah, okay.

2512
01:43:41,341 --> 01:43:42,509
Now, listen...

2513
01:43:42,968 --> 01:43:44,511
I hear about anything,

2514
01:43:44,678 --> 01:43:46,447
I'm snatching you right up
out of there, you hear me?

2515
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:48,223
- Yeah, I hear you.
- I'm not playing.

2516
01:43:48,432 --> 01:43:50,142
Be up there quick fast in a hurry.

2517
01:43:50,309 --> 01:43:53,770
I escort you to the bathroom
and everything if I have to.

2518
01:43:56,356 --> 01:43:57,774
Crazy, Dad.

2519
01:43:57,941 --> 01:43:59,610
But I'm fine with that.

2520
01:43:59,776 --> 01:44:02,154
I'm just happy to stay here.
Happy to be home.

2521
01:44:04,197 --> 01:44:05,574
I'm happy you back.

2522
01:44:05,824 --> 01:44:07,492
See me hooping this year, right?

2523
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:09,661
You got to penetrate more.
Too many jumpers.

2524
01:44:09,828 --> 01:44:10,988
But they go in though.

2525
01:44:11,038 --> 01:44:12,640
Not all
the time, they don't go in.

2526
01:44:12,664 --> 01:44:14,166
Oh, man...

2527
01:44:15,542 --> 01:44:17,687
You don't wanna rock
your dreads like that, man?

2528
01:44:17,711 --> 01:44:20,591
Now if you end up on the Bulls,
your daddy got to go everywhere with you.

2529
01:44:20,714 --> 01:44:22,434
I'm gonna be the team barber.

2530
01:44:22,925 --> 01:44:23,926
Damn, man.

2531
01:44:24,134 --> 01:44:25,427
All right.

2532
01:44:25,802 --> 01:44:26,922
Slow down.

2533
01:44:27,304 --> 01:44:28,305
Hey.

2534
01:44:28,555 --> 01:44:31,516
You ain't comb your hair in six months,
it's a little nappy down there.

2535
01:44:31,683 --> 01:44:34,353
All kind of cucabugs back here. Beebees.

2536
01:44:34,561 --> 01:44:35,896
You gonna be all right.

2537
01:44:37,731 --> 01:44:39,524
Yeah. That's it.

2538
01:44:41,276 --> 01:44:42,277
Oh.

2539
01:44:43,487 --> 01:44:45,030
Look fresh.

2540
01:44:46,198 --> 01:44:48,241
Now you look like my son again.

2541
01:44:48,742 --> 01:44:50,535
I'm getting all the shorties
at school now.

2542
01:44:51,370 --> 01:44:52,371
Yeah.

2543
01:44:52,537 --> 01:44:54,247
Now you can sweep up the hair.

2544
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:57,751
<i>Dear Chicago,</i>

2545
01:44:57,918 --> 01:45:00,087
<i>I know I was hard on you before,</i>

2546
01:45:00,253 --> 01:45:01,713
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

2547
01:45:01,880 --> 01:45:04,161
<i>If there's one thing I know about you,</i>

2548
01:45:04,549 --> 01:45:06,760
<i>is that you know how to bounce back.</i>

2549
01:45:07,552 --> 01:45:11,515
<i>And we salute
Chicago's own South Side Champs.</i>

2550
01:45:14,893 --> 01:45:15,936
Chicago, stand up.

2551
01:45:16,103 --> 01:45:17,562
Chicago, stand up.

2552
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:20,107
We want them to believe in themselves.

2553
01:45:20,273 --> 01:45:22,234
<i>We want them to believe
in their community.</i>

2554
01:45:22,401 --> 01:45:24,569
<i>We want them to believe
that they have a future.</i>

2555
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,947
We are college bound.
We are exceptional.

2556
01:45:27,114 --> 01:45:29,408
Not because we say it,
but because we work hard at it.

2557
01:45:29,574 --> 01:45:31,326
Hey! Congratulations, Miss Paxton.

2558
01:45:35,414 --> 01:45:39,710
<i>You've always taken personal
tragedy and turned it into triumph.</i>

2559
01:45:40,085 --> 01:45:41,128
No, don't do it...

2560
01:45:41,545 --> 01:45:43,088
Give me that!

2561
01:45:43,255 --> 01:45:44,756
<i>- Yeah. Yeah.</i>
- No, no, no!

2562
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:46,633
- Breaking down like LeBron!
- Oh.

2563
01:45:46,800 --> 01:45:48,343
- Know that. Know that.
- Yeah.

2564
01:45:49,428 --> 01:45:51,114
<i>That's why
I'm not giving up on you.</i>

2565
01:45:51,138 --> 01:45:53,015
There we go. This what we running.

2566
01:45:53,724 --> 01:45:56,059
<i>Because you never gave up on me.</i>

2567
01:46:00,439 --> 01:46:01,648
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2568
01:46:02,232 --> 01:46:04,276
- Who won? Who won?
- Boom, every time.

2569
01:46:05,110 --> 01:46:06,236
Mr. Wilson!

2570
01:46:09,823 --> 01:46:12,159
<i>And I know whatever happens,</i>

2571
01:46:12,451 --> 01:46:13,910
<i>eventually,</i>

2572
01:46:14,077 --> 01:46:15,495
<i>Chicago,</i>

2573
01:46:15,829 --> 01:46:18,123
<i>you'll find your way back home.</i>

2574
01:46:18,457 --> 01:46:20,125
<i>You always do.</i>

2575
01:46:22,961 --> 01:46:24,087
What's up?

2576
01:46:27,841 --> 01:46:30,135
Yeah, who won? What's the real story?

2577
01:46:30,302 --> 01:46:31,511
What's the real story?

2578
01:46:31,970 --> 01:46:33,346
Who won? Who won?

2579
01:46:34,806 --> 01:46:36,433
<i>Let's just stick to cutting hair, right?</i>

2580
01:46:41,313 --> 01:46:43,774
<i>What can
the people of Chicago take away from this?</i>

2581
01:46:43,940 --> 01:46:47,152
It's a reminder that the individual,
or, in this case, individuals,

2582
01:46:47,319 --> 01:46:48,487
can make a big difference.

2583
01:46:48,820 --> 01:46:50,322
<i>As a former barber in the shop,</i>

2584
01:46:50,489 --> 01:46:52,467
<i>- it's been very inspiring...</i>
- Is that Jimmy James?

2585
01:46:52,491 --> 01:46:53,634
<i>...for me to see the people of community</i>

2586
01:46:53,658 --> 01:46:54,802
<i>come together and show the world</i>

2587
01:46:54,826 --> 01:46:56,506
<i>that there's still hope on the South Side.</i>

2588
01:46:56,661 --> 01:46:58,705
<i>- Mr. James!
- Ms. Cruz.</i>

2589
01:46:58,872 --> 01:47:00,641
<i>In light
of the success of the ceasefire,</i>

2590
01:47:00,665 --> 01:47:02,810
<i>have you personally changed
your mind about the enclosure,</i>

2591
01:47:02,834 --> 01:47:05,670
<i>and do you think it'll have any effect
on the upcoming council vote?</i>

2592
01:47:05,837 --> 01:47:06,880
Go ahead, Jimmy.

2593
01:47:07,047 --> 01:47:08,483
<i>Well, I can't speak for the council,</i>

2594
01:47:08,507 --> 01:47:11,468
<i>but I'd be shocked if they voted yes,
when so many have voted against it.</i>

2595
01:47:12,010 --> 01:47:13,196
<i>See, the whole point of the enclosure</i>

2596
01:47:13,220 --> 01:47:14,980
<i>was to decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

2597
01:47:15,013 --> 01:47:16,653
<i>And I think that
Mr. Palmer and Ms. Norris</i>

2598
01:47:16,681 --> 01:47:17,682
Oh!

2599
01:47:17,849 --> 01:47:18,993
<i>and the rest of the team down at the shop</i>

2600
01:47:19,017 --> 01:47:20,685
<i>found a way to do just that.</i>

2601
01:47:21,103 --> 01:47:22,343
<i>- That's right!
- Whoo!</i>

2602
01:47:22,771 --> 01:47:23,811
<i>Yeah!</i>

2603
01:47:27,734 --> 01:47:29,528
Dad! You see this?

2604
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:32,882
- Man, that's got to...
<i>- No, it ain't.</i>

2605
01:47:32,906 --> 01:47:34,032
Oh! Serious?

2606
01:47:34,199 --> 01:47:35,239
- Oh, my God.
- Whoa! Whoa!

2607
01:47:35,367 --> 01:47:36,701
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

2608
01:47:36,868 --> 01:47:38,912
- Hey, everybody!
- Hell, no.

2609
01:47:39,079 --> 01:47:40,348
It's good to see you.

2610
01:47:40,372 --> 01:47:41,516
- How are you?
- Mr. President.

2611
01:47:41,540 --> 01:47:42,683
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

2612
01:47:42,707 --> 01:47:43,851
<i>I like that sharp suit.</i>

2613
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:45,353
- Hey, I'll get you one.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

2614
01:47:45,377 --> 01:47:46,521
<i>- Gotcha.
- Okay.</i>

2615
01:47:46,545 --> 01:47:48,380
Mr. President, how you doing, sir?

2616
01:47:48,547 --> 01:47:51,424
You know, it's good to be back
where it all started for me.

2617
01:47:51,675 --> 01:47:52,717
The South Side.

2618
01:47:52,884 --> 01:47:54,803
- I told you.
- Hey, Eddie!

2619
01:47:55,554 --> 01:47:57,794
Very good to see you. Good to see you.

2620
01:47:58,056 --> 01:47:59,242
Take that jacket off.

2621
01:47:59,266 --> 01:48:00,725
- Should I say hi?
- Yeah.

2622
01:48:00,892 --> 01:48:02,012
- Hi!
<i>- How you doing?</i>

2623
01:48:02,060 --> 01:48:03,300
Have a seat right there.

2624
01:48:05,021 --> 01:48:06,582
I was telling these kids
how I used to cut

2625
01:48:06,606 --> 01:48:08,584
- your hair back in the day.
- You sure did.

2626
01:48:08,608 --> 01:48:10,168
You was running around here organizing.

2627
01:48:10,235 --> 01:48:11,546
You know, I gotta get a picture of this.

2628
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:13,047
- Calvin, take this picture.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

2629
01:48:13,071 --> 01:48:14,406
Bam!

2630
01:48:14,573 --> 01:48:16,950
How you doing, Mr. President?
My name's Calvin.

2631
01:48:17,117 --> 01:48:18,702
I own the shop with Angie right here.

2632
01:48:18,869 --> 01:48:19,870
- I'm Angie. Hi.
- Yeah.

2633
01:48:20,036 --> 01:48:21,180
<i>We appreciate your small business.</i>

2634
01:48:21,204 --> 01:48:23,081
Hey, Mr. President.
New Democrat right here.

2635
01:48:23,248 --> 01:48:24,791
All right! Congratulations!

2636
01:48:26,293 --> 01:48:27,478
Stop acting all nervous, Eddie.

2637
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:28,938
You know you know what you're doing.
Come on, man.

2638
01:48:28,962 --> 01:48:31,399
I cut the man's hair years ago.
I know what I'm doing right here.

2639
01:48:31,423 --> 01:48:32,424

Mr. President, I just want to say,

2641
01:48:34,217 --> 01:48:36,777
you know, I really love what you've done
for the black community.

2642
01:48:36,803 --> 01:48:38,597
<i>All right.
And I'm loving those pants.</i>

2643
01:48:38,763 --> 01:48:40,724
- Oh, thank you.
- Appreciate your patriotism.

2644
01:48:40,891 --> 01:48:42,267
I salute you, too.

2645
01:48:43,935 --> 01:48:45,437
Barry. Come on, now.

2646
01:48:45,604 --> 01:48:46,605
I'm sorry.

2647
01:48:46,771 --> 01:48:49,232
Okay, here we go. Low like you always do?

2648
01:48:49,399 --> 01:48:50,959
Come on, now, hook your man up.

2649
01:48:51,109 --> 01:48:52,944
- Little bit.
- Are you shaking, Eddie?

2650
01:48:53,153 --> 01:48:54,713
Eddie, you got it.

2651
01:48:54,738 --> 01:48:56,281
Come on, Eddie. Represent now.

2652
01:49:02,162 --> 01:49:03,288
<i>Eddie!</i>

2653
01:49:03,622 --> 01:49:05,123
One-Stop,

2654
01:49:06,082 --> 01:49:07,459
you got some salve?

2655
01:49:08,627 --> 01:49:10,253
<i>I can fix it! I can fix it!</i>

2656
01:49:10,420 --> 01:49:11,630
<i>Sit back down!</i>

2657
