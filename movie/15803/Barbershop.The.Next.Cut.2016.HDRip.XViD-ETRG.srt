<i>For what?</i>

35
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,095
For introducing me to Rashad.

36
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:54,464
Y'all gonna be
divorced in a minute.

37
00:01:56,131 --> 00:01:58,568
No, I'm just playing with you.

<i>it's out of love that I say this.</i>

45

<i>But recently,</i>

46
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,753
<i>things ain't been the same

47
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,589
<i>Lately, you've been
out of control.</i>

48
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:22,158
<i>At least 24 people
were shot and injured.</i>

49
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:24,761
<i>Police believe most shootings
were gang-related.</i>

50

<i>And I'm not the only one</i>

We've just gone to a new low.
When you now...

53
00:02:29,765 --> 00:02:31,334
<i>There used to be a day
when there was a code.</i>

54
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,734
<i>You didn't kill children.
You didn't kill mothers.</i>

55
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:35,604
<i>You didn't kill grandmothers.
There is no boundary.</i>

56
00:02:35,672 --> 00:02:37,573
Children are dying in the street.

57
00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,208
We Have to the violence.

58
00:02:39,275 --> 00:02:40,543
<i>The streets are talking.</i>

59
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,345
<i>They're tired.</i>

60
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,848
<i>They're angry.</i>

61
00:02:55,424 --> 00:02:58,693
<i>WBBM news time, 6:32.</i>

62
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:00,562
<i>Violence on Chicago's streets</i>

63
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:02,799
<i>took no holiday
for the long weekend.</i>

64
00:03:02,864 --> 00:03:04,967
<i>Police say at least
eight people were killed</i>

65
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:08,037
<i>and 20 others wounded
in shootings since Thursday.</i>

66
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:10,238
<i>That's an increase over
last year's holiday weekend</i>

67
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:12,908
<i>that saw five killed
and 14 wounded.</i>

68
00:03:12,976 --> 00:03:14,609
Lord.

69
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:16,544
Hey, Eddie. What's up, man?

70
00:03:16,612 --> 00:03:18,614
Calvin, I messed up
this time, man.

71
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,814
I'm telling you.
I did something wrong.

72
00:03:19,882 --> 00:03:21,550
What?

73
00:03:21,616 --> 00:03:23,151
There's a bunch of them Gangster
Disciples down there in the corner,

74
00:03:23,218 --> 00:03:24,853
with their pants hanging
all around their ankles.

75
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:27,422
And I told them how they was a
bunch of conjugal visits gone bad.

76
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:29,358
And they're coming down here.
They're coming after me, Calvin.

77
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:31,126
- I need the strap!
- Strap?

78
00:03:31,192 --> 00:03:32,360
I need the heat!
Where's the heater?

79
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:33,561
Ain't no heat in here, man.

80
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:34,697
The gun! The gat!

81
00:03:34,763 --> 00:03:36,398
There ain't no gun in this shop.

82
00:03:36,465 --> 00:03:37,700
So we ain't got no gun?

83
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:39,268
They're about to come
in here with AKs

84
00:03:39,335 --> 00:03:40,769
and 47s and Desert Eagles,

85
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:44,072
and we got nothing
but witch hazel!

86
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,708
Eddie. Are you serious?
Because I don't see nobody.

87
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:48,110
Here they come!

88
00:03:48,176 --> 00:03:49,311
- Where?
- Come on!

89
00:03:49,377 --> 00:03:51,813
Come on, Calvin! Come on!

90
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,382
Shit! Man.

91
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:54,983
Shit, man.

92
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,218
What are we gonna do?

93
00:03:57,887 --> 00:04:01,122
You know what, I talked
my way into this,

94
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,657
maybe I can talk my way out of it.

95
00:04:02,725 --> 00:04:04,359
Man, we can go out the back.
Let's just go out the back!

96
00:04:04,426 --> 00:04:06,395
I can't run, Calvin. I'm old.

97
00:04:06,461 --> 00:04:07,896
- Let's go.
- I'm just gonna talk to them.

98
00:04:07,962 --> 00:04:09,163
They're young boys,
and I'm gonna talk to them.

99
00:04:09,231 --> 00:04:11,400
Listen, you're not
going out there!

100
00:04:11,466 --> 00:04:13,035
Let me get something. Just wait.

101
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:14,571
Calvin! Don't.

102
00:04:16,604 --> 00:04:18,006
There we go.

103
00:04:19,107 --> 00:04:20,742
<i>Let's be reasonable.</i>

104
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:23,578
<i>Everybody just calm down.
Let me just talk to you.</i>

105
00:04:23,645 --> 00:04:25,681
<i>- Everybody stay cool-headed.
- Shit.</i>

106
00:04:25,748 --> 00:04:28,217
<i>Hey! Hey! Hey!
Just give me one of...</i>

107
00:04:28,284 --> 00:04:30,420
Leave that man alone!
Black lives matter!

108
00:04:30,486 --> 00:04:31,988
He's old and decrepit!

109
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:36,792
<i>Pedro, Feliz Navidad.</i>

110
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,160
Eddie.

111
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,261
You want some?

112
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:41,130
- Man.
- I got you.

113
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:42,530
I'm tired of this, Eddie.

114
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,071
That sandwich was hand-crafted.

115
00:04:53,241 --> 00:04:54,811
<i>And you should have heard!</i>

116
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:56,277
"Black lives matter!"

117
00:04:56,345 --> 00:04:58,246
"Eddie, don't go out there,
they're gonna kill ya!"

118
00:04:58,313 --> 00:05:00,984
He was quivering like
Terrence Howard at the Oscars.

119
00:05:01,049 --> 00:05:02,551
See, Eddie, that's your problem.

120
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:03,953
You play too damn much, man.

121
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:05,953
One day, somebody gonna be
chasing your ass for real.

122
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,857
You know what I"a do?
I"a let them catch you.

123
00:05:07,924 --> 00:05:09,392
Okay, okay.

124
00:05:10,559 --> 00:05:12,261
You know the rules, baby boy.

125
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,696
If you like it, you pay.

126
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,398
If you don't like it,
your ass pay anyway.

127
00:05:15,463 --> 00:05:16,965
Nice. Nice.

128
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,537
Well, Isaac,

129
00:05:22,604 --> 00:05:24,739
it's good running into you again.

130
00:05:24,806 --> 00:05:27,042
Man, she know she ain't never
ran a day in her life.

131
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:31,712
You gonna call me, right?

132
00:05:33,316 --> 00:05:34,482
You crazy.

133
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,785
All right...

134
00:05:36,852 --> 00:05:38,388
Yes!

135
00:05:38,453 --> 00:05:40,288
All right, Soror. Girl,
I'll talk to you later.

136
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:41,623
Bye.

137
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:42,790
You know you my girl and...

138
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:44,459
<i>All right, baby girl.</i>

139
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:45,761
See you around.

140
00:05:46,895 --> 00:05:48,097
Damn!

141
00:05:48,164 --> 00:05:50,199
What happened to the
barbershop, Calvin?

142
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:52,367
I used to come here
to get away from women.

143
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,735
Especially the ones
I'll never ever

144
00:05:53,802 --> 00:05:55,470
wanna see again as long as I live.

145
00:05:55,537 --> 00:05:58,073
You know you love the ladies,
especially the sistas.

146
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,874
Yeah, it's true,
I like the sisters. I do.

147
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:01,576
Just not that one.

148
00:06:01,643 --> 00:06:03,746
But homegirl in a catsuit,
though, she could get it.

149
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:04,881
What's good, ma?

150
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:06,214
Not you, pa.

151
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,783
What them
pockets do, little daddy?

152
00:06:09,849 --> 00:06:11,119
You can come over here
and frisk me if you like.

153
00:06:13,054 --> 00:06:14,823
Now, I'm gonna keep it
real here for a second.

154
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,525
This was a male sanctuary.

155
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:18,627
This is the original man cave.

156
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:20,528
<i>And now, it's just a club,</i>

157
00:06:20,595 --> 00:06:22,497
with the lights on, and no drinks.

158
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:25,467
Yo, Isaac. It is what it is, man.

159
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,369
The recession ain't never
left the South Side.

160
00:06:27,436 --> 00:06:29,371
Joining forces saved us both.

161
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:30,640
Well, change is good.

162
00:06:31,907 --> 00:06:33,342
Everyone be well.
Good seeing y'all.

163
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:34,243
- I'll see you around again soon.
- Later.

164
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:35,477
Bye.

165
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:36,845
Peace. Good luck with everything.

166
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,013
<i>Send me some pictures.</i>

168
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,950
Hit me up anytime you want.
I"a see you later.

169
00:06:43,018 --> 00:06:44,386
He swear he cute.

170
00:06:44,453 --> 00:06:45,822
Aight, don't get
nothing on you now.

171
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:48,256
<i>Look at him. He gonna chase her.</i>

172
00:06:48,323 --> 00:06:50,092
<i>Watch him. Watch him go.</i>

173
00:06:50,157 --> 00:06:51,193
<i>Hey, Aisha!</i>

174
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,428
I told you!

175
00:06:54,462 --> 00:06:55,563
Y'all see that one?

176
00:06:55,631 --> 00:06:57,032
He like them big like that.

177
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,600
Eddie, not cool.

178
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:01,270
<i>Go on back to your seat,
Poetic Injustice.</i>

179
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,006
- What up?
- What up, pimpin'?

180
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:05,107
What up, G-ball?

181
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:06,241
<i>What's hangin', Rashad?</i>

182
00:07:06,308 --> 00:07:07,776
What up, J, Bree, Angie?

183
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:08,878
- Hey, Rashad.
- Morning, Rashad.

184
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:10,079
Hey, yo, boy. Cal, what up?

185
00:07:10,145 --> 00:07:11,412
- What's up with you, man?
- You good?

186
00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:12,580
- Good, I'm good.
- Aight.

187
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:13,681
<i>Seriously.</i>

188
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:14,883
Your girl does need to be careful

189
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,286
wearing all of that red
and gold down 79th.

190
00:07:17,352 --> 00:07:19,422
Yeah, man. The Vice
Lords don't play that.

191
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:20,621
You can't just wear their colors

192
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:21,823
and walk down
the street unchecked.

193
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,725
Man, the streets
is crazy right now.

194
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:25,393
I damn near got robbed
the other day.

195
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,794
I did get robbed the other day.

196
00:07:26,862 --> 00:07:28,297
What? Man, I got robbed twice

197
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,433
on the same day on the same block.

198
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:31,934
That ain't shit.

199
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,003
Last week, I got robbed twice

200
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,305
and got my ass beat
by the second robber

201
00:07:36,371 --> 00:07:38,040
for giving all my
money to the first.

202
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:40,643
She wasn't playing.

203
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,978
I've been living on
the south side since '52.

204
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,782
I've been robbed,
been shot, been stabbed.

205
00:07:45,847 --> 00:07:48,049
Hell, been stoned, been groped,

206
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:49,450
and almost lynched twice.

207
00:07:49,518 --> 00:07:51,621
Nobody tried to lynch
your musty ass.

208
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,321
The only reason I'm still here

209
00:07:53,388 --> 00:07:54,523
is because the first time,

210
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,191
they didn't know
how to tie the knot.

211
00:07:56,258 --> 00:07:58,227
So I just slipped right out.

212
00:07:58,294 --> 00:07:59,428
<i>And second time,</i>

213
00:07:59,494 --> 00:08:01,262
the tree was too short.

214
00:08:03,332 --> 00:08:06,402
Hey, Calvin, I finished
reorganizing that supply closet.

215
00:08:06,467 --> 00:08:07,669
You want me to sweep before I go?

216
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:08,904
- No, man.
- You sure?

217
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:10,506
No. No, go on ahead to school.

218
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,407
- You sure, man?
- Yeah, man, positive.

219
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:13,976
- Here you go.
- Man, I appreciate that for sure.

220
00:08:14,042 --> 00:08:15,343
I appreciate it, too.

221
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,579
- I'm gonna see you again next week.
- Okay.

222
00:08:17,647 --> 00:08:18,881
<i>Take care, Angie.
You be careful out there.</i>

223
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,448
- Bye, Anthony.
- All right, y'all.

224
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:21,533
All right, man. Thanks!

225
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,551
All right, Chris Beige.

226
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:23,852
Now, don't get robbed.

227
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,987
You a trip.

228
00:08:25,052 --> 00:08:26,354
<i>Rashad, your son's here!</i>

229
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,922
Hey, what up,
everybody? Hey, Angie.

230
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,290
<i>There you go, double-trouble.</i>

231
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:30,692
What's up, Eddie? Good.

232
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,861
Hey, what's up, Dad?
How's everything?

233
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:35,364
Pretty good. Shouldn't you
two be at school by now?

234
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,799
Yeah, we on our way.

235
00:08:36,865 --> 00:08:38,700
I just stopped by because
I need to borrow $20.

236
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:41,235
Dad, come on, I need it.

237
00:08:41,302 --> 00:08:42,470
Angie, you got 20 bucks?

238
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:44,172
Yeah, I got 20.

239
00:08:44,239 --> 00:08:45,624
Yo, Rashad, you got a dub on you?

240
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,008
Yes, sir. What up, son?

241
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:48,977
Does everybody in here
that's working...

242
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:51,747
What up, Dad? -got at least
$20 in their pocket or purse?

243
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:52,899
Yeah, I do.

244
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,983
Indeed, I do.

245
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,585
I had $20, but I got robbed.

246
00:08:57,753 --> 00:08:59,287
That was serious,
I ain't make that up.

247
00:08:59,354 --> 00:09:00,523
That bitch was swole.

248
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,691
Not now, Dante. Not now.

249
00:09:03,758 --> 00:09:05,427
Do you know what all these
people got in common?

250
00:09:05,861 --> 00:09:06,928
They old?

251
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,230
<i>Hold on now. Hey!</i>

252
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,298
<i>Hey, Dad!</i>

253
00:09:10,364 --> 00:09:11,466
You know, you ain't too grown

254
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:12,633
to get your butt whooped.

255
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,702
Cal, you want me to take
care of this for you?

256
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,604
- No, I got this.
- Okay.

257
00:09:16,672 --> 00:09:17,739
Relax, Adrian Peterson.

258
00:09:17,806 --> 00:09:19,608
It's 2016, not 1816.

259
00:09:19,675 --> 00:09:22,978
You can't pull kids pants down and spank
their bottoms until it turns red.

260
00:09:23,045 --> 00:09:24,979
It's illegal and a little creepy.

261
00:09:25,047 --> 00:09:26,547
Ain't nobody talking about that
Catholic school you went to.

262
00:09:26,614 --> 00:09:28,750
Do I look like Father Flanagan?

263
00:09:28,816 --> 00:09:31,354
When I was growing up,
ass whippings were like meals,

264
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,555
<i>and I was well-fed.</i>

265
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,689
<i>Hey, Kenny.</i>

266
00:09:33,755 --> 00:09:36,124
So, can we maybe
get back to the $20?

267
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,625
Whatever happened to you
coming around

268
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:39,694
after school every now
and then and helping out?

269
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,396
Dad, come on. You know I'm busy
with homework and basketball.

270
00:09:42,464 --> 00:09:44,032
We've been busy with work.

271
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,801
<i>It's a simple equation, son.</i>

272
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,804
<i>You don't work,
you don't get paid. Okay?</i>

273
00:09:48,869 --> 00:09:51,506
<i>This ain't The Oprah Show. You don't
just show up and get free gifts.</i>

274
00:09:52,141 --> 00:09:53,676
Aight.

275
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:55,945
And I better not find out that
you're late to that school.

276
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,579
Told you, man.

277
00:09:57,646 --> 00:09:58,648
Hey, Kenny.

278
00:09:59,715 --> 00:10:01,115
I seen that.

279
00:10:01,182 --> 00:10:02,317
<i>Put it back.</i>

280
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,186
<i>I saw you, Kenny.</i>

281
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,388
Those candy bars are a dollar
apiece, if you want one.

282
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,190
<i>I'm not playing.</i>

283
00:10:08,257 --> 00:10:11,327
If not, I'm assume you took 50 and I'm
taking it out your pop's paycheck.

284
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,328
And he don't make that much.

285
00:10:13,396 --> 00:10:15,898
Not to put your business out
there, but Terri does make more.

286
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:18,534
Put it back.

287
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,868
<i>Busted!</i>

288
00:10:21,003 --> 00:10:22,003
Everybody, check your wallets.

289
00:10:22,971 --> 00:10:24,239
<i>He got sticky fingers.</i>

290
00:10:25,474 --> 00:10:27,443
- Y'all have a blessed day.
- Shut up!

291
00:10:27,508 --> 00:10:28,777
<i>"Have a blessed day"?</i>

292
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:31,547
He said, "Have a blessed day."

293
00:10:31,614 --> 00:10:34,215
I mean, why your dad's
gotta be so stingy?

294
00:10:34,282 --> 00:10:37,419
Thinking he teaching lessons
and dropping knowledge.

295
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:39,020
That shit is annoying.

296
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,722
For real, bro.

297
00:10:40,788 --> 00:10:42,157
Him and your dad,

298
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:44,325
always talkin' out
the sides of their face.

299
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,827
Talking about
how they repping 79th,

300
00:10:46,894 --> 00:10:49,130
all that nonsense, South
Side, all that stupid shit.

301
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:50,298
Stupid shit.

302
00:10:55,204 --> 00:10:57,138
What's up, G?

303
00:10:57,205 --> 00:10:59,508
What size is them Jordans?

304
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,209
They my size. That's
what size they are.

305
00:11:01,276 --> 00:11:02,978
You think you got heart?

306
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:05,147
Well, guess what, little nigger.
Hearts ain't bulletproof.

307
00:11:05,214 --> 00:11:06,614
Hey, why don't y'all
just keep moving?

308
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:08,050
Y'all out of your
neighborhood anyway.

309
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:09,585
Nigger, what you talking about?

310
00:11:09,652 --> 00:11:11,286
Y'all know our crew
run this whole neighborhood.

311
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:12,755
We run this whole shit.

312
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:15,556
Hey, yo, shorty, run them kicks.

313
00:11:15,624 --> 00:11:17,259
Man, y'all niggas ain't shit.

314
00:11:18,926 --> 00:11:20,528
Yeah, I said it.

315
00:11:20,595 --> 00:11:22,697
Nigga, this our block.
You know that.

316
00:11:23,764 --> 00:11:25,667
Unless you really wanna do it.

317
00:11:32,007 --> 00:11:33,008
We out.

318
00:11:34,008 --> 00:11:35,210
All right.

319
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,278
<i>Yeah, I thought so.</i>

320
00:11:37,546 --> 00:11:38,948
Yeah, keep it pushing.

321
00:11:40,849 --> 00:11:42,151
Get out of here, man.

322
00:11:45,988 --> 00:11:47,123
<i>Bitch-ass nigga.</i>

323
00:11:47,956 --> 00:11:49,290
Yo, thanks, Yummy.

324
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,393
Ain't nothing.

325
00:11:51,091 --> 00:11:52,360
What's up, J?

326
00:11:52,427 --> 00:11:54,496
Heard you balled out this season.

327
00:11:54,564 --> 00:11:56,832
Hey, you know,
trying to do my thing.

328
00:11:56,898 --> 00:11:58,066
Man, coach already talking about

329
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,467
bumpin' him up
to varsity next year.

330
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:01,836
Word? That's good, man.
Keep putting in work.

331
00:12:01,902 --> 00:12:03,504
<i>You know, that's how you
get to the big leagues,</i>

332
00:12:03,571 --> 00:12:05,140
<i>like D-Rose and D-Wade.</i>

333
00:12:05,206 --> 00:12:06,841
Y'all need anything though?
Y'all straight?

334
00:12:08,243 --> 00:12:09,244
We cool.

335
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:11,912
I got somethin' for y'all, man.

336
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:14,148
I know how it be, being
a little homie. You know?

337
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:16,185
I know y'all cool, be cooler.

338
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:17,786
Ben Frank style.

339
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:20,089
Gotta keep the little homies
fresh, you feel me?

340
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,657
Yo, thanks, Yummy.

341
00:12:21,724 --> 00:12:23,959
Y'all gonna be family
soon anyway, right?

342
00:12:24,026 --> 00:12:25,728
- Fo' sho?
- Yeah.

343
00:12:25,793 --> 00:12:27,561
There's a lot more
where that came from.

344
00:12:27,628 --> 00:12:28,696
So get used to it.

345
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:29,764
All right, Yummy.

346
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:30,865
I'll holler at you, J.

347
00:12:30,932 --> 00:12:31,933
All right.

348
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,302
Yo!

349
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:36,238
Girl, keep the change.

350
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:37,790
You like it?

351
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,777
Damn, I see you getting
that chop over there, girl.

352
00:12:41,844 --> 00:12:42,844
Yes, I am.

353
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:44,680
How much you charge
for them weaves?

354
00:12:44,747 --> 00:12:47,516
Well, it depends. 'Cause
if you wanna be basic ass

355
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:49,950
<i>No, No, No
Destiny's Child Beyonce,</i>

356
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:51,753
that's gonna cost you, like, $200.

357
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,789
<i>If you wanna be like,
you know, Cater 2 U Beyonce,</i>

358
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,523
that's gonna cost you, like, $600.

359
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,095
And if you wanna be
Beyonce featuring Jay Z...

360
00:12:59,161 --> 00:13:00,762
Boom, boom.

361
00:13:01,963 --> 00:13:03,766
That's gonna cost
you, like, a stack.

362
00:13:03,832 --> 00:13:06,935
I can't believe y'all spend all
that money on weaves anyway.

363
00:13:07,002 --> 00:13:08,537
Next thing you know,
you gonna be just

364
00:13:08,603 --> 00:13:11,707
high-jacking and robbing
Puerto Ricans for their hair.

365
00:13:11,773 --> 00:13:14,676
Eddie, the only hair getting
stolen around here is Indian hair.

366
00:13:14,743 --> 00:13:18,714
It's lush, it's beautiful, and it's infused
with coconut oil right out the womb, okay?

367
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,683
<i>That's why all y'all want it.</i>

368
00:13:20,749 --> 00:13:23,317
Man, I can't believe y'all put
all that money on your heads,

369
00:13:23,384 --> 00:13:25,553
and then don't be having
no money for your rent.

370
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,023
Excuse you, this is
how I pay my rent.

371
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,591
Exactly.

372
00:13:29,657 --> 00:13:31,960
'Cause with this hair
and this booty,

373
00:13:32,027 --> 00:13:33,861
it's like walking around
with a black AmEx.

374
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:36,297
And I never get denied.

375
00:13:36,364 --> 00:13:37,965
I bet you don't.

376
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:39,902
Y'all in here complaining
about our weaves,

377
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,437
but y'all negroes
know good and well

378
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,940
that you'd drop-kick Lupita
to get to Kim Kardashian.

379
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,674
Even the non-negroes.

380
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,244
Especially the non...

381
00:13:50,012 --> 00:13:51,279
Can I say negroes?

382
00:13:51,345 --> 00:13:52,947
Carefully, very carefully.

383
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,350
Say it slow so we can
hear all the syllables.

384
00:13:56,652 --> 00:13:58,052
Just be remorseful
when you say it.

385
00:13:58,119 --> 00:14:00,822
Cool. Negroes.

386
00:14:00,888 --> 00:14:03,225
As the only non-negro
in the room, I'd like to say,

387
00:14:03,291 --> 00:14:04,527
Lupita's got a Dark Caesar,

388
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,128
and it's one of my
most requested cuts.

389
00:14:06,195 --> 00:14:07,528
<i>Lupita?</i>

390
00:14:07,595 --> 00:14:10,331
Man, don't nobody want no
bald head chick in real life.

391
00:14:10,398 --> 00:14:13,534
Even Kanye got rid of Amber
for Kim's sexy ass.

392
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:15,136
Every day, y'all here complaining

393
00:14:15,204 --> 00:14:17,339
about fake weaves and fake asses,

394
00:14:17,406 --> 00:14:20,275
but all the girls that you like
on Instagram have exactly that.

395
00:14:20,341 --> 00:14:22,443
Fake weaves and fake asses.

396
00:14:22,509 --> 00:14:24,245
- No offense, Draya.
- None taken, girl.

397
00:14:24,311 --> 00:14:25,846
We winning and y'all ain't.

398
00:14:25,913 --> 00:14:28,282
I mean, but that's what dudes
want, they want that fantasy.

399
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:31,387
Yeah, a fantasy that you still
expect us real women to live up to.

400
00:14:31,452 --> 00:14:33,321
What? Men are visual,
all right? What's the problem?

401
00:14:33,388 --> 00:14:35,324
And women aren't?

402
00:14:35,391 --> 00:14:37,926
I mean, you don't think we want some
nice, thick, sexy lips to suck on,

403
00:14:37,993 --> 00:14:40,396
and some nice big broad shoulders,

404
00:14:40,461 --> 00:14:44,265
and a dick print that you can see
from here to the Sears Tower?

405
00:14:44,331 --> 00:14:45,600
Preach.

406
00:14:47,902 --> 00:14:50,504
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Hey! The language!</i>

407
00:14:50,571 --> 00:14:52,640
Watch your mouth in here.
Draya, get your girl.

408
00:14:52,706 --> 00:14:54,309
Sorry, Mr. Cal.

409
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,912
You know what the whole problem
with your generation is?

410
00:14:57,979 --> 00:14:59,514
You don't know how to do nothing,

411
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,715
need to learn a skill.

412
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:02,017
Learn how to mop a floor.

413
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:04,185
You know what I'm saying? Iron.

414
00:15:04,252 --> 00:15:07,255
Your phone die, you wouldn't
know how to spell a sentence.

415
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,625
Smart phone, dumb girls!

416
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,329
Learn how to cook a decent
meal, for goodness' sake.

417
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,698
Look, some of them don't
even know how to microwave.

418
00:15:16,764 --> 00:15:18,734
Had a girl come over
to my house last week,

419
00:15:18,801 --> 00:15:20,902
went into my kitchen,
thought mine was a safe.

420
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:24,138
I bet that shit was empty.

421
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:27,441
And I can't believe you, Eddie.

422
00:15:27,508 --> 00:15:30,077
I can't believe that you
expect your visual fantasy

423
00:15:30,144 --> 00:15:33,982
to actually mop and iron
for your old ass?

424
00:15:34,048 --> 00:15:37,451
You come to my house, you better
know how to clean and iron.

425
00:15:37,518 --> 00:15:39,654
Only thing gonna be
wrinkling around my house

426
00:15:39,721 --> 00:15:41,622
is my forehead when I say,

427
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:42,857
"Bitch, what?"

428
00:15:44,993 --> 00:15:46,929
You need manners.

429
00:15:46,995 --> 00:15:48,696
<i>Yeah, Angie. Please!</i>

430
00:15:48,763 --> 00:15:53,201
It doesn't matter how much a woman
tries to live up to your fantasies.

431
00:15:53,268 --> 00:15:57,672
Doesn't matter if a woman tries to wash
your crusty ass drawers every night.

432
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,841
Doesn't matter if she fixes him
a special batch of vegan chili,

433
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:03,611
even though chili is
supposed to have meat in it!

434
00:16:03,678 --> 00:16:06,314
<i>Everybody knows that
chili has meat in it!</i>

435
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,949
That's what it is,
it doesn't matter,

436
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:09,450
because he's still gonna
wake up one morning

437
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:12,454
and leave your ass
for some chick on Instagram!

438
00:16:12,521 --> 00:16:15,191
Who had sex with you
and didn't appreciate it?

439
00:16:16,057 --> 00:16:18,159
Vegan chili is delicious.

440
00:16:18,226 --> 00:16:19,627
Trust me on this, ladies.

441
00:16:19,694 --> 00:16:21,729
The only man that you can
trust is the one up above.

442
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:22,964
<i>Come on, Bree.</i>

443
00:16:23,031 --> 00:16:24,900
That dude, Ronnie,
he was just a bad apple.

444
00:16:24,966 --> 00:16:26,801
<i>If you and your man
had something real,</i>

445
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:29,870
it wouldn't have mattered
how bad the Instagram ho was.

446
00:16:29,937 --> 00:16:31,872
She wouldn't have been able
to come between y'all.

447
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,075
Not even for
Jamaicanthickthighs24?

448
00:16:34,142 --> 00:16:36,044
Jerrod.

449
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:38,679
Ass so fat you can see
it from the front.

450
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,249
- Let me see.
- Send me that.

451
00:16:40,316 --> 00:16:41,749
- Yeah, right there.
- There is a God.

452
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:43,685
- Smell that.
- It's not scratch-and-sniff.

453
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,154
<i>Ass cheeks so separated...</i>

454
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,654
You know what, ladies?

455
00:16:46,721 --> 00:16:48,689
For years it has been a war,

456
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,559
with the good girls and the hoes,

457
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,527
and the hoes have officially won.

458
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,128
Go, hoes!

459
00:16:55,497 --> 00:16:56,865
Love me some hoes.
I can't live without hoes.

460
00:16:56,931 --> 00:16:58,767
I gotta have them.

461
00:16:58,832 --> 00:17:01,869
Hoes know
what to do and when to do it!

462
00:17:01,936 --> 00:17:03,604
<i>Wait. Wait. Hold up!</i>

463
00:17:03,671 --> 00:17:06,941
You girls keep complaining about
the chauvinistic talk in the shop,

464
00:17:07,007 --> 00:17:09,343
but y'all do the same
thing in reverse.

465
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,714
Each one of y'all
want a super thug

466
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,549
that can hold his own on the
yard at the Cook County jail,

467
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:17,686
that's got three degrees from
Harvard and making six figures.

468
00:17:17,753 --> 00:17:19,221
You know it.

469
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,490
Meanwhile, you pass up corny
dudes like Jerrod every day.

470
00:17:21,557 --> 00:17:23,191
<i>Exactly.</i>

471
00:17:23,257 --> 00:17:24,792
Don't no woman want no moist

472
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:27,029
Duncan Hines ass dude like Jerrod.

473
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:28,564
No.

474
00:17:28,565 --> 00:17:30,032
Jerrod's like boiled okra.

475
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:34,436
He's just green and stringy, just completely
unappetizing to the human palate.

476
00:17:35,904 --> 00:17:37,372
Such kind words, you guys.
I really appreciate it.

477
00:17:37,438 --> 00:17:38,739
<i>A couple things.</i>

478
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,142
First of all,
I'm standing right here.

479
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:41,275
I can hear you.

480
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:42,676
And second of all...

481
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:44,279
Baller alert!

482
00:17:44,344 --> 00:17:46,246
<i>No, he did not just pull up
in a Maserati, girl!</i>

483
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,382
<i>Is that L. Rock
from the Bears? My God.</i>

484
00:17:48,449 --> 00:17:50,551
<i>He just got
a $47 million contract.</i>

485
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:53,688
35 guaranteed and
four with incentives.

486
00:17:55,689 --> 00:17:57,558
Craig came by here 20 minutes
ago looking for you.

487
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:59,027
Okay, thanks, Cal. I'll text him.

488
00:17:59,093 --> 00:18:00,594
Hey, babe.

489
00:18:00,661 --> 00:18:02,596
I need you to pick up Maya
from school today, too.

490
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,767
I just squeezed in another last-minute
appointment and I can't do it.

491
00:18:04,832 --> 00:18:06,234
Yeah, I see.

492
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:07,467
Come on, babe, please.

493
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,271
I got an appointment, too.

494
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,172
- Can't Kenny do it?
- I asked Kenny.

495
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:13,141
He said he was too busy,
which is really funny,

496
00:18:13,207 --> 00:18:15,109
because I don't know what a
15-year-old could be busy doing

497
00:18:15,176 --> 00:18:18,312
other than drinking up all my goddamn
apple juice and dirtying up the house.

498
00:18:18,379 --> 00:18:20,416
That's easy,
they masturbate a lot.

499
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:21,884
<i>What? They do.</i>

500
00:18:21,949 --> 00:18:23,284
I mean, I was 15.

501
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,287
I was 15 this morning.
Am I right, Raja?

502
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,057
Don't touch me with that hand,
don't touch me in general.

503
00:18:29,123 --> 00:18:31,225
Come here, let me get your beard.

504
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,061
<i>That's all? Really?</i>

505
00:18:33,128 --> 00:18:35,996
So you playing celebrity
barber and I'm Mr. Mom now?

506
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:38,532
You're the one who said you wanted to
spend more time with Maya and Kenny,

507
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,935
- so what's the problem?
- Some time.

508
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:41,770
Half your clients
was mine to start.

509
00:18:41,837 --> 00:18:43,171
<i>You complaining now?</i>

510
00:18:43,237 --> 00:18:44,571
When Kenny's mom
asked if he can spend

511
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,140
the remainder of
high school with us,

512
00:18:46,207 --> 00:18:47,575
I was cool with it.

513
00:18:47,642 --> 00:18:49,410
But since he's been with us,
he's done nothing to help out.

514
00:18:49,477 --> 00:18:50,288
Yeah, come on.

515
00:18:50,289 --> 00:18:51,912
It's like we have two
toddlers in the house.

516
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,815
- It's a new situation.
- It's not a new situation.

517
00:18:53,881 --> 00:18:55,649
It's been a year!
You're being too soft on him!

518
00:18:55,716 --> 00:18:57,051
You know how long
he was with his mother.

519
00:18:57,118 --> 00:18:58,753
<i>I understand that.
All right, y'all.</i>

520
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,022
Yo, Terri and Rashad! Yo!

521
00:19:01,089 --> 00:19:02,857
Do y'all need a minute?
Because we'll all leave.

522
00:19:02,924 --> 00:19:04,725
You know what? I'm gonna leave.

523
00:19:04,792 --> 00:19:07,061
<i>It's like Love & Hip Hop
reunion in here.</i>

524
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,295
<i>Momma Dee and Lil Scrappy.</i>

525
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:10,331
Terri, girl, I couldn't
help but overhear.

526
00:19:10,398 --> 00:19:12,400
I mean, girl,
everybody could hear.

527
00:19:12,466 --> 00:19:15,203
But, I wanted to tell
you, and I told Rashad,

528
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,540
I could pick up Maya, like,
whenever you need me to.

529
00:19:18,606 --> 00:19:20,275
So let me know
if I can help out, girl.

530
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,811
In any... In any way.

531
00:19:22,878 --> 00:19:25,280
<i>I don't need nothing but
for you to back up a few feet.</i>

532
00:19:25,346 --> 00:19:27,715
This is a private discussion
between me and my husband.

533
00:19:27,782 --> 00:19:29,217
I mean, I didn't realize
it was so private

534
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,084
'cause, like I said,
everybody can hear y'all.

535
00:19:31,151 --> 00:19:33,121
But y'all been
a little bit overwhelmed,

536
00:19:33,187 --> 00:19:36,557
and let me release
some of that stress.

537
00:19:38,159 --> 00:19:40,195
Why don't you help yourself
back to your station, Draya?

538
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,830
Look, Terri. I got you.
I got you, baby. Come here.

539
00:19:42,898 --> 00:19:44,264
My bad, girl.

540
00:19:44,331 --> 00:19:45,966
Don't even get riled up
like that, Terri.

541
00:19:46,033 --> 00:19:47,468
It's all good. Stay in your lane.

542
00:19:47,535 --> 00:19:49,937
Come on. Baby,
come here, I got you.

543
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:52,173
I'll go get Maya,
you do what you gotta do.

544
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,675
I know we need the money, so...

545
00:19:53,742 --> 00:19:55,310
Thank you.

546
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:58,178
Well, you know,
when I get home later,

547
00:19:58,245 --> 00:19:59,715
I'll make it up to you.

548
00:19:59,782 --> 00:20:01,316
I'll do that thing you like.

549
00:20:01,381 --> 00:20:02,950
Yeah, okay.

550
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:05,519
Sure you gonna be
burnt out by tonight.

551
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:09,058
It's all right, though. I'll wait for
the morning for that lazy side booty.

552
00:20:11,892 --> 00:20:13,361
Terri, just out of curiosity,

553
00:20:13,427 --> 00:20:15,629
what is that thing that you do?

554
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,364
Is it something that I can Google?

555
00:20:17,432 --> 00:20:18,600
<i>Yo, Calvin, what's
the Wi-Fi password?</i>

556
00:20:20,734 --> 00:20:22,303
Let me get that Lupita.

557
00:20:23,204 --> 00:20:27,042
Excellent choice.

558
00:20:27,108 --> 00:20:28,510
<i>You wanna act grown?</i>

559
00:20:28,576 --> 00:20:30,445
Well, now you got
a grown-man haircut.

560
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:32,446
Yeah, this gotta be
some of my best work.

561
00:20:37,051 --> 00:20:38,786
Your friends at school
gonna love this.

562
00:20:40,121 --> 00:20:41,855
That's the information
super highway right there.

563
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,159
Let's go.

564
00:20:44,225 --> 00:20:46,194
So you learned your
lesson today, didn't you?

565
00:20:46,261 --> 00:20:49,263
You look good, man!
Nothin' can stop you now.

566
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:51,799
Tell Weezy I said "hey!"

567
00:20:51,866 --> 00:20:53,202
Eddie...

568
00:20:53,267 --> 00:20:54,702
Tell me that ain't child abuse.

569
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:57,772
I bet you he won't be talking
back to his mama no more.

570
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,375
Gave him the George Jefferson.

571
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,378
<i>All right, looking good.</i>

572
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:06,415
Hi. Who are you here to see?

573
00:21:06,481 --> 00:21:08,016
Yeah, I'm here to see One-Stop.

574
00:21:08,081 --> 00:21:09,917
Take a number.

575
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:12,020
They all here to see One-Stop.

576
00:21:12,086 --> 00:21:13,455
- Everybody?
- Yeah.

577
00:21:14,421 --> 00:21:15,656
Right, right.

578
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:18,893
That's what I said.

579
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:20,127
Give me a minute, brother.

580
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:23,031
I need eight 32-inch TVs.
No plasma, man.

581
00:21:23,097 --> 00:21:24,898
Just LCDs, brotha.
You know what I mean?

582
00:21:24,965 --> 00:21:26,767
<i>I got the watches,
I got the rings.</i>

583
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:29,136
I'm doing tailoring, I'm doing a
little bit of everything now, brotha.

584
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,437
<i>Right, right, right, right.</i>

585
00:21:30,504 --> 00:21:31,939
No, I just do the measurements.

586
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:33,874
I got a little Asian lady
who puts the suit together.

587
00:21:33,942 --> 00:21:35,376
<i>She sews. I don't sew.</i>

588
00:21:37,212 --> 00:21:40,515
Calvin, you really just gonna let
this fool come slidin' up in here

589
00:21:40,581 --> 00:21:41,633
<i>like he run the place?</i>

590
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:43,917
Eddie, worry about your section.

591
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:46,888
Pardon me.

592
00:21:47,955 --> 00:21:49,992
Look here, Truck-Stop, One-Stop.

593
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,027
Come here, son.
This the barber shop.

594
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:55,095
You gotta get people in and out.
That's what we do.

595
00:21:55,163 --> 00:21:57,766
You got these musty negroes
sitting around here all day,

596
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,567
like it's an unemployment office.

597
00:21:59,635 --> 00:22:02,537
Hey, Eddie, man, look. I pay booth
rent like everybody else does in here.

598
00:22:02,603 --> 00:22:03,971
Besides,

599
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:06,340
barbers don't provide the full
menu of services that I do.

600
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:08,576
Off-market medicinal remedies,

601
00:22:08,642 --> 00:22:10,577
alternative documentation,

602
00:22:10,645 --> 00:22:12,780
little emotional service doggies

603
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:14,482
that lick your face and make
you feel good about yourself.

604
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:16,685
And they
tinkle all over your shirt.

605
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,487
They so happy to see you. And
it makes you feel good inside.

606
00:22:19,553 --> 00:22:21,656
I've been around
a long time here, son.

607
00:22:21,723 --> 00:22:24,826
And what all you do
is sell fake ID,

608
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,261
nickel bags of weed,
and pit bull puppies.

609
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:29,597
Talking about a little puppy
gonna lick on somebody's face.

610
00:22:29,664 --> 00:22:31,165
It sounds too freaky for me.

611
00:22:31,232 --> 00:22:32,600
I don't want no puppy
licking on me.

612
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,502
It's just not at all
African-American.

613
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,870
Sounds very, very Caucasian.

614
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:39,273
Calvin, you really gonna
let him be up in the shop?

615
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:40,675
Like, I can't believe
he let you up in here.

616
00:22:42,209 --> 00:22:44,446
Calvin, my man.
You're my man, right?

617
00:22:44,513 --> 00:22:47,249
Please tell this man,
this ancient being,

618
00:22:47,314 --> 00:22:48,682
this old fogey,

619
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,384
this dinosaur of some sorts.

620
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:51,786
Keep them coming.

621
00:22:51,852 --> 00:22:54,054
This negro-saurus of a man
walking around here giving us

622
00:22:54,121 --> 00:22:55,523
<i>the damn trailer to Jurassic Park,</i>

623
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:56,890
every time we walk up in here.

624
00:22:58,225 --> 00:23:00,160
Okay, that was a good
one right there.

625
00:23:00,227 --> 00:23:03,531
<i>Please tell this 50 Shades
of Grey... looking ass,</i>

626
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:05,899
am I or am I not

627
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,270
a intricate part of
this damn shop?

628
00:23:09,102 --> 00:23:10,272
He got a point, Eddie.

629
00:23:10,338 --> 00:23:12,440
He got...

630
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,479
You know what? That's it for me.

631
00:23:18,545 --> 00:23:20,114
Hey. But this
ain't no free clinic.

632
00:23:20,182 --> 00:23:23,084
I understand. And I did stop doing
the VD screenings last week.

633
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:26,153
It's done, okay? It's over.

634
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:27,354
What can I do for you, brotha?

635
00:23:27,421 --> 00:23:29,523
I got a itch

636
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,759
down there.

637
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,059
<i>It's a itch that burns.</i>

638
00:23:32,126 --> 00:23:34,696
Come over here. This the last one.

639
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:36,498
<i>This boy burning bad,
I smell it. Come on.</i>

640
00:23:36,563 --> 00:23:37,649
Hey, everybody!

641
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,734
<i>Hey, girl.</i>

642
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,601
Rashad, I got your
sheen spray for you.

643
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,070
<i>Appreciate that.</i>

644
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,572
Angie, this conditioner should
last you for the next two weeks.

645
00:23:44,638 --> 00:23:46,107
<i>Thank you, baby!</i>

646
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,742
Can you help me put
these away in the back?

647
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:49,744
<i>Hey, who's winning over
here, now? What's goin' on?</i>

648
00:23:52,446 --> 00:23:54,416
By a show of hands,
who got a itch?

649
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:55,817
Who got a burn?

650
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,418
Damn.

651
00:23:57,484 --> 00:24:00,021
<i>So did you hear,
Mr. Harris got shot?</i>

652
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:01,923
What?

653
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,892
Are you serious?

654
00:24:03,957 --> 00:24:05,826
Is he okay?

655
00:24:05,894 --> 00:24:08,896
I mean, he got shot,
so he's not great.

656
00:24:08,963 --> 00:24:10,098
But he's gonna make it.

657
00:24:10,165 --> 00:24:11,532
No.

658
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,968
I was just in there last
week talking to his wife.

659
00:24:15,035 --> 00:24:18,739
Man. She was so excited they
was getting a second location.

660
00:24:19,674 --> 00:24:20,775
Was she with him?

661
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:22,409
No, thank God.

662
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:24,711
You know, he was in there by
himself closing up for the night.

663
00:24:24,779 --> 00:24:27,949
Wouldn't open up the
register, so they shot him.

664
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:30,252
I don't know what's
happening out there, Calvin.

665
00:24:30,318 --> 00:24:32,287
These kids have lost
their damn minds.

666
00:24:32,353 --> 00:24:34,755
Meanwhile, we gotta
raise Jalen in this mess.

667
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:36,657
It's not cool.

668
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:40,461
We gotta revisit
that conversation.

669
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:42,898
What conversation?

670
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:45,867
About moving the shop.

671
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:49,337
You know, One-Stop found some cool
locations over there on the north side.

672
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:52,441
Does One-Stop even know
what escrow means?

673
00:24:52,506 --> 00:24:54,609
You'd be surprised
what One-Stop know.

674
00:24:54,676 --> 00:24:56,677
And have you discussed
it with Angie?

675
00:24:56,744 --> 00:24:58,379
You can't make a
decision about the shop

676
00:24:58,446 --> 00:25:00,247
without at least
talking to her first.

677
00:25:00,314 --> 00:25:03,083
I wanted to talk to you first because
you know what you're gonna tell me?

678
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,619
"Why did you talk to her first?"

679
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:06,021
I do not sound like that.

680
00:25:09,523 --> 00:25:10,925
I don't know, Calvin.

681
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:14,162
Uprooting the shop
is a big decision.

682
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:16,630
You don't think I know that?

683
00:25:16,697 --> 00:25:18,099
But what else we supposed to do?

684
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:19,600
Just sit here and wait
for somethin' to happen?

685
00:25:21,802 --> 00:25:24,205
We gotta explore
all of our options.

686
00:25:25,873 --> 00:25:27,241
Yeah.

687
00:25:35,483 --> 00:25:36,484
<i>I ain't got no money.</i>

688
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:37,619
<i>Let me talk to you.</i>

689
00:25:37,686 --> 00:25:38,852
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

690
00:25:38,919 --> 00:25:40,153
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

691
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:41,455
<i>Let's holler at you
for a little bit.</i>

692
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:42,455
<i>You hollerin' right now,</i>

693
00:25:42,523 --> 00:25:43,590
<i>I can hear you. I'm good.</i>

694
00:25:43,657 --> 00:25:44,824
<i>Yo, who that?</i>

695
00:25:44,891 --> 00:25:46,226
<i>Hey, what up, J.D.?</i>

696
00:25:46,293 --> 00:25:47,361
Hey!

697
00:25:47,428 --> 00:25:49,796
Hey, I got that tater
salad for your mama!

698
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,231
<i>Come get it! All right.</i>

699
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,135
What's going on,
hungry black folks?

700
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:56,805
Who wants some
non-profit Gangsta Grub?

701
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:59,975
All right. Soul food
to save fools' souls.

702
00:26:00,041 --> 00:26:01,208
Every delicious piece of beef

703
00:26:01,275 --> 00:26:03,010
helps keep a bullet
off the street.

704
00:26:03,078 --> 00:26:05,013
I know that's right because
that "Who Smoked Your Okra"

705
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:06,548
was poppin' on fleek last time.

706
00:26:06,615 --> 00:26:07,815
There you go, Draya.

707
00:26:07,881 --> 00:26:09,549
Did she just say "fleek"?

708
00:26:09,617 --> 00:26:11,252
<i>Don't... Don't just make up words.</i>

709
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,721
There's a whole
dictionary full of words.

710
00:26:13,788 --> 00:26:15,490
<i>There's a library down the street.</i>

711
00:26:15,555 --> 00:26:17,958
Webster's Dictionary. Go
in there and flip through it.

712
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:20,227
You won't see "fleek"
in there, nowhere.

713
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,862
Draya, don't worry
about that. I got some

714
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:23,798
"Don't Be So Mean" greens
in there for you today, too.

715
00:26:23,865 --> 00:26:25,066
<i>You gonna love it.
Thank you, boo-boo.</i>

716
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:26,433
They so good, they're gonna make

717
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,837
a Vice Lord give
a GD a foot massage.

718
00:26:30,137 --> 00:26:31,138
<i>Nigga!</i>

719
00:26:33,107 --> 00:26:36,011
You are like the Al
Sharpton of the fat back.

720
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:37,054
Okay. Okay.

721
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,480
When are you gonna get
your own show on VH1?

722
00:26:38,546 --> 00:26:40,146
Who knows, man?
You know, right now,

723
00:26:40,214 --> 00:26:41,916
I'm just happy being the
pillar of the community,

724
00:26:41,983 --> 00:26:43,283
<i>trying to do something good.</i>

725
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,585
I mean, so, you want us to believe

726
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,288
that you cooked
all that food yourself?

727
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:50,191
My kitchen workforce is
made up of ex-gangbangers,

728
00:26:50,257 --> 00:26:51,992
who, if they didn't have this job,

729
00:26:52,059 --> 00:26:53,528
would be on the street bangin'.

730
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:54,928
And you donating all the profit?

731
00:26:54,995 --> 00:26:56,497
What's so hard
to believe about that?

732
00:26:59,967 --> 00:27:01,268
What is it, Eddie? What is it?

733
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:02,870
Rashad, you might have
to shut your mouth.

734
00:27:02,936 --> 00:27:05,238
This pie got me
dancing a jig over here.

735
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,542
Don't be no sucker, Eddie.

736
00:27:08,743 --> 00:27:09,944
What's that, Rashad?

737
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:12,047
I got the little peanut
butter and poverty sandwich.

738
00:27:12,112 --> 00:27:13,614
Did Terri cut the edges
off the bread

739
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,882
like she does for the baby, too?

740
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:19,186
Yo, J.D., man. This
is on the up and up.

741
00:27:19,253 --> 00:27:20,888
- I'm proud of you, bro.
- Thanks, Calvin.

742
00:27:20,955 --> 00:27:22,556
- But the name...
- What?

743
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:25,092
I'm a little concerned, man. The name
seems like you're promoting something.

744
00:27:25,158 --> 00:27:26,660
Man, I'm just promoting food.

745
00:27:26,727 --> 00:27:29,562
Remember the words of Maya
Angelou, man. "Words is power."

746
00:27:29,629 --> 00:27:30,698
Maya Ange-who?

747
00:27:32,266 --> 00:27:33,934
I know who you're talking about.

748
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:36,037
That big booty bitch
we went to high school with,

749
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:37,771
with the lopsided
titties, I remember.

750
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:39,907
Calvin, come on, man.
You know I'm just joking, man.

751
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,809
You know I know
who Maya Angelou is.

752
00:27:41,876 --> 00:27:43,344
"Still I rise."

753
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:45,212
<i>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.</i>

754
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,148
Who is this on the cover?
It looks like Mike Tyson.

755
00:27:53,154 --> 00:27:54,188
<i>Gonna be a double-breasted suit.</i>

756
00:27:54,254 --> 00:27:56,791
Can't win for losing.

757
00:27:58,659 --> 00:28:02,362
Well, there he goes!
Harold Washington, Junior.

758
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,165
- What up, Jimmy?
- What's up, man?

759
00:28:05,233 --> 00:28:06,801
- You're lookin' good.
- Good to see you.

760
00:28:06,868 --> 00:28:08,101
You know, you're the only
one that comes in here

761
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:09,637
with a suit on that
ain't goin' to court.

762
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:15,208
Everybody ain't tryin' to wear one
of them granny sofa suits you got.

763
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:16,677
- Guess who's back?
- Hey, Jimmy.

764
00:28:16,744 --> 00:28:18,413
What up, bro?

765
00:28:18,478 --> 00:28:20,047
<i>What bring you around here?</i>

766
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,183
I know you didn't come all the
way over here to the South Side

767
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:23,551
just for a line up.

768
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:25,153
Yeah. Where's your
camera crew, Jimmy?

769
00:28:25,219 --> 00:28:26,787
Doing a little press opp
for the mayor's office?

770
00:28:26,853 --> 00:28:29,289
What, a man can't check out his old
stomping grounds on his lunch break?

771
00:28:29,357 --> 00:28:30,357
- Hell, nah.
- No.

772
00:28:30,424 --> 00:28:31,476
No.

773
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:32,527
Hell no.

774
00:28:32,592 --> 00:28:34,662
All right, you got me.

775
00:28:34,728 --> 00:28:36,930
I do want to talk to you all about this
Council vote that's coming up next week.

776
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:38,065
What vote?

777
00:28:38,131 --> 00:28:39,299
The one about the enclosure.

778
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:40,634
- Closure?
- What enclosure?

779
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:41,802
What kind of enclosure?

780
00:28:41,869 --> 00:28:43,638
The city plans to
gate off 20 blocks,

781
00:28:43,704 --> 00:28:45,639
with this shop essentially
right in the middle of it.

782
00:28:45,706 --> 00:28:47,507
See, the idea is that
if it can control traffic,

783
00:28:47,574 --> 00:28:49,042
you know, one way in, one way out,

784
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,744
<i>it'll help decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

785
00:28:50,811 --> 00:28:53,281
So they're just gonna
build a jail around us?

786
00:28:53,348 --> 00:28:55,482
Do you know what cuttin' off these
streets is gonna do to traffic?

787
00:28:55,549 --> 00:28:57,251
You're right.
It might increase traffic.

788
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,987
<i>But it might also decrease
violence in the neighborhood,</i>

789
00:28:59,053 --> 00:29:00,553
which would make
this shop more desirable.

790
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,989
That ain't gonna help us.

791
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:04,425
<i>We'll just be a
nonviolent empty shop.</i>

792
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:08,128
Exactly. And half the businesses on
this block are barely above water.

793
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:08,845
Exactly.

794
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:10,798
Look, y'all. I know it's not
the most ideal solution.

795
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:13,067
But you gotta acknowledge that at
least we're trying to do something.

796
00:29:13,134 --> 00:29:14,702
- No.
- Yeah. No.

797
00:29:14,769 --> 00:29:16,037
Hell no.

798
00:29:16,102 --> 00:29:17,370
<i>Look, y'all, I share
the same concerns,</i>

799
00:29:17,437 --> 00:29:19,205
but something's gotta
be done out here.

800
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:21,141
Do you know how many people get shot
on this block, every single week?

801
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:22,609
Do you?

802
00:29:22,676 --> 00:29:25,013
'Cause we out here
dodging bullets every day,

803
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,013
while you downtown talkin'
about the South Side,

804
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,917
look like some Middle Eastern,
war-torn country in your $1,000 suit.

805
00:29:30,984 --> 00:29:33,888
You know damn well them
suits ain't $1,000, boyba.

806
00:29:33,954 --> 00:29:35,889
Look, Rashad, we want
the same thing, man.

807
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:38,726
But the Council, they're all out
of ideas just like everybody else.

808
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:39,994
That's right. Put it on us.

809
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,729
<i>That's what politicians do though.</i>

810
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:43,096
<i>You know, they don't
do their job...</i>

811
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:44,365
All I'm doing is workin', brother.

812
00:29:44,432 --> 00:29:45,533
<i>But then they want us to do it.</i>

813
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,734
And then you say
it's our fault, right?

814
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,468
Like, we the ones
that don't wanna work.

815
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:49,870
<i>Exactly. I told you.</i>

816
00:29:49,936 --> 00:29:51,805
I mentioned this a long time ago.

817
00:29:51,872 --> 00:29:56,209
Government ain't good for nothing but
giving you syphilis and flu shots.

818
00:29:56,276 --> 00:29:58,778
I'm almost sure
that's how I got syphilis.

819
00:29:58,846 --> 00:30:01,148
That is not how you got syphilis.

820
00:30:01,215 --> 00:30:02,683
Her name was Josephine.

821
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,253
Would you stop
tellin' everybody's business!

822
00:30:06,321 --> 00:30:09,389
That's funny.
My mom's name is Josephine.

823
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,427
Wait. What...

824
00:30:15,295 --> 00:30:17,430
You know, maybe that's part
of the problem. I mean...

825
00:30:17,497 --> 00:30:19,299
Maybe we need to stop
waiting for the government

826
00:30:19,366 --> 00:30:22,002
to step in and save us and we
need to start saving ourselves.

827
00:30:22,069 --> 00:30:23,404
<i>I mean, this is America.</i>

828
00:30:23,471 --> 00:30:25,573
Everybody has equal
opportunity to make it here.

829
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:26,674
Really?

830
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,742
- What?
- Okay.

831
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,109
<i>Man...</i>

832
00:30:29,176 --> 00:30:31,978
All right. Baba ghanoush
over here lost his damn mind.

833
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:33,380
Eddie, that's bullshit.

834
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:34,782
You wanna know why I'm sarcastic?

835
00:30:34,849 --> 00:30:36,317
Because every time I open my mouth

836
00:30:36,384 --> 00:30:38,152
to say something real,
you gotta make fun of me.

837
00:30:38,218 --> 00:30:40,787
Meanwhile, if I say you're a
watermelon-flavored fried chicken lover,

838
00:30:40,855 --> 00:30:41,856
I'm a racist.

839
00:30:41,923 --> 00:30:43,424
<i>Hell nah.</i>

840
00:30:43,491 --> 00:30:44,993
You'll get your ass beat.

841
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:46,961
Rashad, it was hypothetical.

842
00:30:47,026 --> 00:30:48,795
There's no such thing as
watermelon-flavored fried chicken.

843
00:30:48,862 --> 00:30:50,264
Not yet, Raja.

844
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:53,199
That would be
stereotypically delicious.

845
00:30:53,266 --> 00:30:56,503
All I'm saying is, my parents moved
here from India with nothing.

846
00:30:56,571 --> 00:30:58,272
<i>They had no money, no friends.</i>

847
00:30:58,339 --> 00:30:59,674
And their accents were so thick,

848
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,242
they couldn't even
get bank accounts.

849
00:31:01,308 --> 00:31:02,410
And somehow they made it happen.

850
00:31:02,476 --> 00:31:04,711
Not to dismiss your
argument here, Raja,

851
00:31:04,778 --> 00:31:06,781
because it is... It is riveting.

852
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:09,751
However, there were some
"setbacks" that black people faced

853
00:31:09,817 --> 00:31:11,919
that really made things
stressful for a minute there.

854
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:14,487
Slavery being at the
very top of that list.

855
00:31:14,554 --> 00:31:16,590
Exactly. Your ancestors
were immigrants.

856
00:31:16,657 --> 00:31:17,759
Ours were imports.

857
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,225
<i>Big difference. Not really.</i>

858
00:31:19,292 --> 00:31:21,295
How do you think the
West Indies happened, okay?

859
00:31:21,361 --> 00:31:23,830
They took Indians, they took
black people from Africa,

860
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:25,532
they put 'em in the Caribbean,

861
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,035
and 200 years later, Rihanna
happened. You're welcome.

862
00:31:29,302 --> 00:31:31,606
I don't like white
people either. Okay?

863
00:31:31,673 --> 00:31:33,308
I'm just saying,
maybe y'all should stop

864
00:31:33,309 --> 00:31:35,143
making excuses and
actually pick up the ball.

865
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,476
"Pick up the ball"?

866
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:37,777
- Basketball reference.
- That was racist, right there.

867
00:31:37,844 --> 00:31:39,112
"Pick up the ball"?

868
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,281
<i>Yes.</i>

869
00:31:40,348 --> 00:31:42,783
It got real Fox News-y
in here for me.

870
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,986
Well, you know,
we do be shootin' some hoop.

871
00:31:46,053 --> 00:31:47,221
<i>What are you talkin' about, man?</i>

872
00:31:47,288 --> 00:31:49,123
You think it's a level
playing field out here?

873
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:51,057
You think racism
don't exist no more?

874
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:53,794
The President of the United
States of America is black.

875
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,530
The most powerful man
on the planet is black.

876
00:31:56,597 --> 00:31:58,198
Just one man.

877
00:31:58,264 --> 00:32:00,868
<i>Meanwhile, only dude I have to look up
to is the guy from Big Bang Theory.</i>

878
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:03,571
He funny. He make me laugh.

879
00:32:03,638 --> 00:32:07,308
So what does that mean for the average
black dude walking down the street?

880
00:32:07,373 --> 00:32:08,675
Does our president's blackness,

881
00:32:08,743 --> 00:32:12,580
did it stop Trayvon
Martin, or Michael Brown,

882
00:32:12,646 --> 00:32:14,348
or Walter Scott, or Tamir Rice,

883
00:32:14,415 --> 00:32:15,884
or Freddie Gray from being killed?

884
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,750
Hell nah.

885
00:32:17,818 --> 00:32:19,888
A madman walked into
a Charleston church

886
00:32:19,954 --> 00:32:22,590
and killed nine innocent people.

887
00:32:22,657 --> 00:32:25,158
<i>Did his blackness stop that?</i>

888
00:32:25,225 --> 00:32:28,830
Eric Garner got killed on tape
and it still didn't matter.

889
00:32:30,097 --> 00:32:32,366
So what are you saying, Raja?

890
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:34,702
I'm not sayin' that stuff isn't
messed up. Because it is.

891
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,470
What I'm saying is,

892
00:32:36,536 --> 00:32:38,138
there's never been a better time

893
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:41,376
in this country to be a black
person than right now.

894
00:32:41,442 --> 00:32:42,844
Unless you Bill Cosby.

895
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:48,215
I'm not doin' this school work.

896
00:32:48,282 --> 00:32:50,350
If she thinks I'm really about
to do this homework tonight...

897
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:52,419
She gave us six packets.

898
00:32:52,486 --> 00:32:53,586
Six packets.

899
00:32:53,654 --> 00:32:55,857
Man, she must be insane.

900
00:32:58,058 --> 00:33:00,328
<i>Yo, there go those
dudes from this morning.</i>

901
00:33:16,843 --> 00:33:18,845
<i>I used to cut
Barack's hair back in the day.</i>

902
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,983
Hell, I'm the one who told
him to marry Michelle.

903
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:23,617
<i>He liked some other little girl.</i>

904
00:33:23,684 --> 00:33:24,917
<i>He was gonna tell her...</i>

905
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:27,155
Thelma Carter.
With the big tongue.

906
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:29,256
Couldn't say his name.
She used to call him "Barath".

907
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:32,292
Michelle, now, that's different.

908
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:34,361
She got them childbearing hips.

909
00:33:34,428 --> 00:33:35,763
<i>And she can iron a shirt.</i>

910
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,732
You see them arms right there?

911
00:33:40,501 --> 00:33:42,168
You never touched
a hair on that man's head.

912
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:43,870
- Not one.
- Are you serious?

913
00:33:43,937 --> 00:33:45,773
Hold on. Okay. All right. Okay.

914
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,509
Who do you think that is? It's
him before his hair turned gray.

915
00:33:48,576 --> 00:33:49,911
That could be anybody.

916
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:51,812
Man, you can't tell
who that is, man.

917
00:33:51,878 --> 00:33:54,348
It's Barack right there.
You can tell by the ear.

918
00:33:55,482 --> 00:33:56,716
You cannot.

919
00:33:56,783 --> 00:33:58,151
You can't see shit.

920
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:01,688
You're stupid.

921
00:34:01,755 --> 00:34:03,157
You know what? Forget y'all.

922
00:34:03,224 --> 00:34:04,325
<i>Laugh all you want to.</i>

923
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,025
Y'all better just
leave Barack alone.

924
00:34:06,092 --> 00:34:07,260
He's one of ours.

925
00:34:07,328 --> 00:34:09,096
He used to be one of ours.

926
00:34:09,163 --> 00:34:14,001
I mean, when was the last time you
seen Barack Obama do something for us?

927
00:34:14,067 --> 00:34:16,069
And I'm not talkin'
about for the country.

928
00:34:16,136 --> 00:34:17,839
I'm talkin' about for us.

929
00:34:17,904 --> 00:34:19,672
Eddie, even if you don't agree,

930
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:21,942
you still gotta honor
what she's sayin', though.

931
00:34:22,009 --> 00:34:23,044
Thank you, Rashad.

932
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,045
You know, I can't take
this anymore, man. I'm out.

933
00:34:26,046 --> 00:34:26,679
All right.

934
00:34:26,746 --> 00:34:28,215
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Thank you, man.

935
00:34:28,281 --> 00:34:30,350
And you need to read a newspaper.

936
00:34:30,417 --> 00:34:32,418
Obama makes sure you get all that
birth control that you need.

937
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:33,920
Excuse me?

938
00:34:33,987 --> 00:34:37,156
And the rest of y'all, Council
vote next week. Don't forget.

939
00:34:37,223 --> 00:34:40,393
<i>Look, I can't let y'all tear the
President down like that. All right.</i>

940
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,930
The man is in an impossible
situation. Know what I'm sayin'?

941
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,199
- How are you?
- How you doin'?

942
00:34:45,264 --> 00:34:47,567
He's not just the president
of black America.

943
00:34:47,634 --> 00:34:50,170
He's the President of
the United States of America.

944
00:34:50,237 --> 00:34:53,607
And personally, I think
he's doin' a great job.

945
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:57,043
You know what? The two of them just make
me believe in the sanctity of marriage.

946
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,346
I hate to be
the one to say this...

947
00:35:01,181 --> 00:35:02,850
But Barack has
definitely got bitches.

948
00:35:02,917 --> 00:35:04,451
Yeah, he does.

949
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,720
No, he has not.

950
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:09,022
Half these hoes weren't even registered
to vote before he ran for president.

951
00:35:09,089 --> 00:35:10,257
<i>Give me a break!</i>

952
00:35:10,324 --> 00:35:14,462
Every vote... Ass. Ass, ass,
ass. That's what it is.

953
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:17,197
You know what?
I hate to agree with Dante,

954
00:35:17,264 --> 00:35:19,266
'cause, it's just a bad look.

955
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:22,269
But every president
has a side chick.

956
00:35:22,335 --> 00:35:23,936
<i>It's constitutional.</i>

957
00:35:24,003 --> 00:35:27,641
You know, Thomas Jefferson had a
whole plantation of side chicks.

958
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,910
I bet you Hillary's
got a side chick.

959
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:31,679
Probably thick too.

960
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,518
<i>What's up, Terri? What up, Quis?</i>

961
00:35:42,989 --> 00:35:46,592
Looks like you're on the
wrong side of town, nigga.

962
00:35:46,659 --> 00:35:49,864
Boy, this whole city is mine.
These are my blocks.

963
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:52,532
And I don't see nobody out there
strong enough to take it from me.

964
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Shit.

965
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:54,869
So what are you sayin'?

966
00:35:54,935 --> 00:35:56,235
You tryin' to embarrass yourself

967
00:35:56,302 --> 00:35:57,638
- and get blood on the floor.
- Embarrass myself?

968
00:35:57,703 --> 00:35:58,839
No! Wait a minute!
Wait, wait, wait.

969
00:35:58,906 --> 00:35:59,806
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

970
00:35:59,873 --> 00:36:00,706
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on!

971
00:36:00,773 --> 00:36:01,942
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

972
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,511
Listen! Wait! Listen!

973
00:36:03,576 --> 00:36:05,045
Listen a minute! No! No! Look...

974
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:06,346
I'll blow your head off, man.

975
00:36:06,413 --> 00:36:07,782
<i>Look, not in here!</i>

976
00:36:07,848 --> 00:36:09,882
Y'all wanna kill each other,
y'all take that shit outside!

977
00:36:09,949 --> 00:36:11,051
Well, let's go outside!

978
00:36:11,118 --> 00:36:12,186
Calvin, what he doing here?

979
00:36:12,252 --> 00:36:13,619
I booked him. I booked him.

980
00:36:13,686 --> 00:36:15,688
He has a standing appointment
with me every other week.

981
00:36:15,755 --> 00:36:17,223
It got messed up
when he went to jail

982
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:18,624
and I didn't know Quis
was gonna be here today.

983
00:36:18,692 --> 00:36:19,726
I'm sorry, y'all.

984
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,061
- Stupid nigga!
- Jay! Jay! Jay!

985
00:36:21,127 --> 00:36:22,495
That's what I'm doing here! Jay!

986
00:36:22,561 --> 00:36:23,663
- Jay! Look at me.
- What you gonna do?

987
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:25,564
Look at me, Jay!

988
00:36:25,632 --> 00:36:27,000
Come back in an hour.

989
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:28,368
Come back in an hour.

990
00:36:28,435 --> 00:36:29,469
<i>Please.</i>

991
00:36:29,536 --> 00:36:30,770
<i>Please.</i>

992
00:36:30,837 --> 00:36:32,372
I'll take care of your bill.

993
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,809
On me.

994
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:37,512
I'll pay for everything,
I'll pay for your hair, man.

995
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:40,815
That's cool, Calvin.

996
00:36:42,815 --> 00:36:44,784
All right. Thank you!

997
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:46,386
You know me, boy. Thank you, man!

998
00:36:46,453 --> 00:36:47,654
You a stupid nigga.

999
00:36:47,721 --> 00:36:48,889
<i>Come on, man. I'm telling you!</i>

1000
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,257
You know what it is.

1001
00:36:50,324 --> 00:36:51,559
<i>In an hour, man. In an hour.</i>

1002
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:55,429
I'm sorry.

1003
00:36:56,897 --> 00:36:58,297
- Thanks, Shad.
- It's all right.

1004
00:36:58,364 --> 00:37:00,901
Big boy, I'm sorry about
that, man. Misunderstanding.

1005
00:37:02,335 --> 00:37:06,339
We usually have that schedule
worked out a little better.

1006
00:37:06,406 --> 00:37:07,775
It's all good, Calvin.

1007
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,580
You know, I'm gonna have to
get that thing from you.

1008
00:37:13,647 --> 00:37:14,648
Yeah. Yeah.

1009
00:37:21,554 --> 00:37:23,589
The other one, too.

1010
00:37:23,656 --> 00:37:25,759
Man, I forgot about that one.

1011
00:37:28,561 --> 00:37:29,596
Damn shame.

1012
00:37:30,897 --> 00:37:32,698
<i>Can't even go to
the barbershop no more</i>

1013
00:37:32,766 --> 00:37:36,170
<i>without some knucklehead
bringin' a gun in here.</i>

1014
00:37:36,235 --> 00:37:38,938
Barbershop used to be
a place of peace.

1015
00:37:39,005 --> 00:37:40,873
It's for my protection.

1016
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:42,208
From what? Some clippers?

1017
00:37:43,543 --> 00:37:46,679
What the hell you need to be
bringing that in here for?

1018
00:37:46,746 --> 00:37:48,281
It's my constitutional right.

1019
00:37:48,348 --> 00:37:49,516
Nigga, spell it.

1020
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,453
Constitutional right!

1021
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:56,322
You need to worry about why ain't
nobody ever sitting in them chairs.

1022
00:37:56,389 --> 00:37:57,690
You probably shot them all.

1023
00:38:00,427 --> 00:38:01,595
Yeah, this Calvin.

1024
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:03,531
It might be a better
question for you.

1025
00:38:03,596 --> 00:38:05,131
- Crazy. Crazy.
- Is he okay?

1026
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,800
Wait. Is he okay?

1027
00:38:06,866 --> 00:38:08,334
<i>Man. Come on, man.
We all lived out here...</i>

1028
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,902
No, I'll be on my way.

1029
00:38:09,969 --> 00:38:11,672
I'll be there. Rashad,
handle that for me.

1030
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:12,807
Yo, Cal, what's up?

1031
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,208
I got you, no worries.

1032
00:38:14,275 --> 00:38:16,543
No! Hell, no, man! He said Rashad.

1033
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,745
No, I don't think he said Rashad.

1034
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:18,911
- Yeah.
- What'd he say?

1035
00:38:18,978 --> 00:38:20,413
Yeah. He said me, Eddie.

1036
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,815
Specifically?

1037
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,684
He called you by name?

1038
00:38:33,393 --> 00:38:36,796
Baby, are you okay?
Did anybody hit you?

1039
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:38,132
<i>No, nothing happened.</i>

1040
00:38:38,197 --> 00:38:39,667
<i>I was just standing there
and a fight broke out.</i>

1041
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:40,801
Don't worry. We're gonna get this

1042
00:38:40,868 --> 00:38:42,168
- all straightened out.
- Mom! I'm fine.

1043
00:38:42,235 --> 00:38:44,038
<i>- Let me see your head.
- No, Mom, I'm okay.</i>

1044
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:46,440
My God. It's,
like, red right here.

1045
00:38:46,507 --> 00:38:48,008
Goodness.

1046
00:38:48,074 --> 00:38:49,644
Let me see your face.

1047
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:56,215
<i>So, what happened?</i>

1048
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:58,118
Well, frankly, Mr. Palmer,

1049
00:38:58,185 --> 00:39:01,221
we're concerned about the people that
Jalen's been hanging around with lately.

1050
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:02,423
Are you talking about Kenny?

1051
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,791
Why would you say that?

1052
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:07,193
'Cause that's who he's been
hanging with every day.

1053
00:39:07,259 --> 00:39:09,595
You guys know I can't talk
about anybody else's kids.

1054
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,063
But let me just say this.

1055
00:39:11,130 --> 00:39:13,799
Jalen has shifted
over these past few weeks.

1056
00:39:13,866 --> 00:39:15,101
His behavior is different.

1057
00:39:15,168 --> 00:39:16,703
<i>His teachers have noticed it.</i>

1058
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:18,371
<i>His grades have started to slip.</i>

1059
00:39:18,438 --> 00:39:20,074
And the fight that happened today,

1060
00:39:20,139 --> 00:39:22,875
he was involved in that fight, which
turned out to be gang-related.

1061
00:39:22,942 --> 00:39:25,545
What do you mean "involved"? Are you
trying to say Jalen's in a gang?

1062
00:39:25,612 --> 00:39:27,947
If he's not already in a gang,

1063
00:39:28,014 --> 00:39:30,283
he's strongly
considering joining one.

1064
00:39:30,351 --> 00:39:32,486
No, no. I'm sorry, Jalen...

1065
00:39:32,552 --> 00:39:34,121
He knows better than that.
He wouldn't do that.

1066
00:39:34,188 --> 00:39:36,257
I understand why you feel
that way, Mrs. Palmer,

1067
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:39,426
but there's also a reality of
what we face in our communities.

1068
00:39:39,493 --> 00:39:41,862
So this year is absolutely
critical for him

1069
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:44,131
to build a foundation
to go off to college.

1070
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:46,667
See? This is what
I've been talking about.

1071
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:48,134
I mean, with Jalen's grades,

1072
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,569
his test scores...

1073
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:51,438
no way in the world
we can't get him a scholarship

1074
00:39:51,505 --> 00:39:53,941
at the private schools,
or remember Holy Cross

1075
00:39:54,007 --> 00:39:55,108
I was telling you,
that Catholic School?

1076
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:56,208
We have to talk about this.

1077
00:39:56,275 --> 00:39:57,310
I'll talk to their coach.

1078
00:39:57,377 --> 00:39:59,179
Mr. Palmer, now hold up.

1079
00:39:59,246 --> 00:40:01,514
Hold up. Now, that's not
what I was suggesting.

1080
00:40:01,581 --> 00:40:04,351
We want Jalen to be here.
The school needs him here.

1081
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:05,786
For what?

1082
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,087
Seem like y'all losing him.

1083
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,789
Mr. Palmer, I understand...

1084
00:40:08,855 --> 00:40:10,323
I'm supposed to sit here

1085
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:13,527
and we're going to sacrifice
our only son to this system?

1086
00:40:13,594 --> 00:40:14,628
There's gotta be
something we can do

1087
00:40:14,694 --> 00:40:15,895
to work together on this.

1088
00:40:15,962 --> 00:40:18,431
Seems like the problem
is bigger than you and me.

1089
00:40:19,699 --> 00:40:21,902
So, why are you pointing
the finger at Kenny?

1090
00:40:21,969 --> 00:40:26,206
No, look. I've been
skeptical about that kid.

1091
00:40:26,272 --> 00:40:27,907
The whole reason
he's living with Rashad

1092
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:30,176
is because he got expelled
from school for fighting.

1093
00:40:31,311 --> 00:40:33,413
Probably some gang-related shit.

1094
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,616
I ain't trying to have
Jalen get caught up,

1095
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:38,085
following behind some
little wannabe thug.

1096
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:40,619
So, you know, maybe we just
talk to him again

1097
00:40:40,686 --> 00:40:42,156
or we ground him or something.

1098
00:40:42,221 --> 00:40:43,790
I don't know, but don't you
think sending him

1099
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:45,759
to Holy Cross
is a little bit extreme?

1100
00:40:45,826 --> 00:40:49,563
After what we just heard?
We gotta send him somewhere!

1101
00:40:49,628 --> 00:40:50,764
I'm not trying to get that call

1102
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:51,932
in the middle of the night

1103
00:40:51,998 --> 00:40:54,167
saying my son
is locked up or worse,

1104
00:40:54,234 --> 00:40:56,136
because we didn't act
when we had a chance.

1105
00:40:58,371 --> 00:40:59,540
Keep your elbow tucked.

1106
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,810
Catholic school?

1107
00:41:02,875 --> 00:41:05,078
I don't know anybody
in Catholic school.

1108
00:41:05,145 --> 00:41:07,982
Good. Maybe it's time for you
to meet some Catholics.

1109
00:41:08,047 --> 00:41:10,149
And tomorrow,
I'm gonna re-introduce you

1110
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,019
to the concept of a belt.

1111
00:41:12,085 --> 00:41:14,321
Ain't nobody wants to see
your butt cheeks hanging out.

1112
00:41:14,386 --> 00:41:15,855
Nobody wears no belts.

1113
00:41:15,922 --> 00:41:17,156
They're corny.

1114
00:41:17,223 --> 00:41:18,692
Yeah, well, so is getting shot.

1115
00:41:20,661 --> 00:41:21,929
When are you going to do
something about

1116
00:41:21,994 --> 00:41:24,029
that abomination on your head
called locks?

1117
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:25,498
I'm not cutting my locks.

1118
00:41:25,565 --> 00:41:26,766
You need to do
something with them.

1119
00:41:28,601 --> 00:41:29,802
You're the son of a barber,

1120
00:41:29,869 --> 00:41:31,371
you can't be walking around here

1121
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,607
<i>looking like that girl from
The Pirates of the Caribbean.</i>

1122
00:41:33,674 --> 00:41:35,141
They're supposed
to look like that.

1123
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,543
No, they're not.

1124
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,779
When you going
to wash them things, man?

1125
00:41:38,844 --> 00:41:41,848
Walking around smelling like
Flavor Flav's wave cap.

1126
00:41:41,915 --> 00:41:43,216
Why are you trying
to take everything

1127
00:41:43,284 --> 00:41:44,919
I like away from me?

1128
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:51,491
Because I love you, that's why.

1129
00:41:53,927 --> 00:41:55,628
So just because you take some
long dramatic pause

1130
00:41:55,694 --> 00:41:56,729
before you say something,

1131
00:41:56,797 --> 00:41:59,367
I'm supposed to just
accept your words?

1132
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:01,901
You're so smart, Jalen.

1133
00:42:03,436 --> 00:42:05,705
If you're that smart,
keep your elbow tucked.

1134
00:42:05,772 --> 00:42:07,975
My elbow is tucked.
My shot is water.

1135
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:11,645
Your shot sucks.

1136
00:42:12,311 --> 00:42:14,147
Who shot suck?

1137
00:42:14,214 --> 00:42:15,815
Boy, you better ask somebody.

1138
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,985
My shot is butter.

1139
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,731
What up, broski?

1140
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,867
I got your message.

1141
00:42:33,933 --> 00:42:35,668
Shorties is wiling, right?

1142
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:37,237
How are you?

1143
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,674
Look, I'm going to need you to
keep your son away from mine.

1144
00:42:40,741 --> 00:42:42,208
What you talking about?

1145
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:44,344
You know that gang fight
that happened yesterday?

1146
00:42:44,411 --> 00:42:46,413
Kenny got Jalen
involved in that shit.

1147
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,847
No, that ain't what happened.

1148
00:42:47,913 --> 00:42:49,248
I talked to Kenny,
he said they was

1149
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:51,084
standing there
and the fight broke out.

1150
00:42:51,918 --> 00:42:53,220
And you believed him?

1151
00:42:53,286 --> 00:42:55,855
Yeah, I believe him. He's my son.

1152
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:57,590
You taking Jalen's word for it.

1153
00:42:57,656 --> 00:42:59,625
You damn right!
Jalen ain't never got

1154
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,428
expelled from school for fighting.

1155
00:43:02,462 --> 00:43:03,630
Is it like that?

1156
00:43:04,931 --> 00:43:07,033
I tell you something in
confidence, man-to-man,

1157
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:08,768
and now you throwing that shit
back in my face?

1158
00:43:09,768 --> 00:43:11,104
I told you that's who Kenny was

1159
00:43:11,172 --> 00:43:12,472
when he was with his mother.

1160
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:14,573
He ain't that kid no more,
he with me.

1161
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:16,409
I'm happy for you.

1162
00:43:16,476 --> 00:43:17,777
Nevertheless,

1163
00:43:17,844 --> 00:43:19,378
keep your son away from mine, man,

1164
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:20,781
or we gonna have a problem.

1165
00:43:23,049 --> 00:43:26,519
Bruh, we got a problem right now.

1166
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:33,492
Two black fathers
bonding in the hood.

1167
00:43:33,560 --> 00:43:34,728
It's rare.

1168
00:43:34,795 --> 00:43:36,496
It's like catching a unicorn.

1169
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:39,032
You don't see it every day, is
what I'm trying to say. Right?

1170
00:43:40,967 --> 00:43:42,636
You want a latte?

1171
00:43:43,837 --> 00:43:47,239
"One-Stop's Home
and Office Decoration."

1172
00:43:47,306 --> 00:43:48,707
Ghetto office.

1173
00:43:48,775 --> 00:43:50,478
Ghetto office, you
decorate somebody's shit.

1174
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,815
So the dog ate the whole condom?

1175
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,949
Yeah.

1176
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:57,518
Frame your face. Shit.

1177
00:43:59,819 --> 00:44:01,654
<i>Okay, Eddie. Come on, man.</i>

1178
00:44:03,156 --> 00:44:04,792
You know what, I've happened
to have enough of him.

1179
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:08,527
Lord, they shooting!
They shooting out there!

1180
00:44:08,594 --> 00:44:10,062
Eddie, stop playing! Get down!

1181
00:44:10,130 --> 00:44:12,432
Hell! It'll take me
too long to get back up.

1182
00:44:12,498 --> 00:44:14,234
I ain't getting down there,
it ain't worth it.

1183
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:16,402
It's fine.

1184
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:18,205
This ain't Fallujah.
Come on. Everybody, stand up.

1185
00:44:21,507 --> 00:44:22,842
<i>My God. I gotta go.</i>

1186
00:44:22,909 --> 00:44:23,944
I can't take it.

1187
00:44:24,011 --> 00:44:25,811
Baby, that's a gang out there.

1188
00:44:25,878 --> 00:44:27,547
<i>It ain't no ice cream truck.</i>

1189
00:44:27,614 --> 00:44:28,882
The idea is stay away
from the bullet,

1190
00:44:28,947 --> 00:44:30,049
don't go towards them.

1191
00:44:30,116 --> 00:44:31,450
I don't think
you understand, Eddie.

1192
00:44:31,518 --> 00:44:32,886
My car broke down earlier today.

1193
00:44:32,953 --> 00:44:35,288
I can't be caught outside
with no car

1194
00:44:35,355 --> 00:44:36,790
and it's dark
and they're shooting...

1195
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:38,390
<i>Draya, I got you.
It's crazy right now!</i>

1196
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,160
<i>I gotta get Maya anyway.
You're on the way,</i>

1197
00:44:40,226 --> 00:44:41,360
so I got you.

1198
00:44:41,427 --> 00:44:42,895
Are you serious, Rashad?

1199
00:44:42,962 --> 00:44:44,397
<i>Hold on, let me get my stuff.</i>

1200
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:46,734
Thank you.

1201
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,136
<i>All right. You good, Eddie?</i>

1202
00:44:49,869 --> 00:44:51,205
Yeah, I'm good.

1203
00:44:52,605 --> 00:44:54,607
I need to get on
out of here anyway.

1204
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:57,409
Yeah. No doubt, no doubt.

1205
00:44:57,476 --> 00:44:59,378
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

1206
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,683
With all that ass,
she ain't safe nowhere.

1207
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,884
The New York Times

1208
00:45:03,949 --> 00:45:05,551
<i>broke this down recently.</i>

1209
00:45:05,618 --> 00:45:07,487
Okay, let's see.

1210
00:45:14,661 --> 00:45:18,231
<i>The second amendment means
we have a right to bear arms.</i>

1211
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:21,502
<i>Should it also mean that
there is no place in our...</i>

1212
00:45:35,915 --> 00:45:37,350
<i>I cannot believe that crazy man</i>

1213
00:45:37,417 --> 00:45:39,351
<i>came in the store
doing that today.</i>

1214
00:45:39,418 --> 00:45:40,788
He was wild!

1215
00:45:41,587 --> 00:45:43,856
No, he played us all.

1216
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:44,925
He was crazy.

1217
00:45:44,991 --> 00:45:46,125
Crazy!

1218
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:52,366
All right, then.

1219
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,002
I'll catch you tomorrow.

1220
00:46:02,808 --> 00:46:04,577
Are you okay, Rashad?

1221
00:46:04,643 --> 00:46:06,612
Like, seriously.

1222
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:10,049
Like, I don't know, lately
you've been so stressed out.

1223
00:46:10,116 --> 00:46:11,818
I'm good! I'm good.

1224
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:13,118
You good?

1225
00:46:13,185 --> 00:46:14,453
Draya, I'm good.

1226
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:17,557
Well, if you need anything,

1227
00:46:17,623 --> 00:46:20,493
even if you just want to talk,
I'm a great listener.

1228
00:46:21,994 --> 00:46:24,663
I know you cool.
I appreciate that.

1229
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:27,066
I might take you up
on that one day.

1230
00:46:28,868 --> 00:46:30,871
Well, what time
you gotta pick up Maya?

1231
00:46:32,672 --> 00:46:36,644
Maybe we can go upstairs
and we could talk now.

1232
00:46:37,344 --> 00:46:38,679
Come on, Draya.

1233
00:46:39,179 --> 00:46:40,580
What?

1234
00:46:40,647 --> 00:46:41,949
You're inviting me to your house

1235
00:46:42,014 --> 00:46:43,317
just to come and talk?

1236
00:46:44,183 --> 00:46:46,084
As opposed to what?

1237
00:46:46,152 --> 00:46:48,522
I mean, I ain't been out
the game that long, Draya.

1238
00:46:49,188 --> 00:46:51,290
Are you serious?

1239
00:46:51,357 --> 00:46:53,259
A pretty girl tries to comfort you

1240
00:46:53,326 --> 00:46:54,528
in your time of stress

1241
00:46:54,594 --> 00:46:55,828
and whatever the hell else
you're going through,

1242
00:46:55,895 --> 00:46:58,430
and you gonna
take it there with me?

1243
00:46:58,498 --> 00:47:01,268
Look, my bad.
I thought you was really...

1244
00:47:01,335 --> 00:47:02,769
Come on. Just because I'm thick,

1245
00:47:02,835 --> 00:47:04,337
it doesn't mean
I don't have a soul.

1246
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,005
But the way you was talking,
it felt like you wanted to...

1247
00:47:06,072 --> 00:47:07,340
You know what? Good night, Rashad.

1248
00:47:07,406 --> 00:47:08,875
It felt like...
I thought you was...

1249
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:10,976
Good night, Rashad!

1250
00:47:11,043 --> 00:47:12,212
<i>Draya, it felt...</i>

1251
00:47:12,279 --> 00:47:13,847
Draya! Draya!

1252
00:47:15,281 --> 00:47:16,382
Damn!

1253
00:47:17,382 --> 00:47:18,685
Damn...

1254
00:47:19,719 --> 00:47:21,321
Man.

1255
00:47:21,388 --> 00:47:23,156
Man.

1256
00:47:23,221 --> 00:47:25,324
Man, she definitely wanted it.
I know she wanted it!

1257
00:47:25,391 --> 00:47:27,827
Hell, yeah! What do you think?

1258
00:47:27,893 --> 00:47:28,962
You think
I ain't gonna think that?

1259
00:47:29,027 --> 00:47:30,196
I mean, she got the...

1260
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:32,565
She sitting there
with it all out like, "Yo."

1261
00:47:32,632 --> 00:47:34,467
Leaning over. I mean...

1262
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:35,568
I ain't tripping, right?

1263
00:47:35,634 --> 00:47:36,869
I ain't been out
the game that long.

1264
00:47:36,936 --> 00:47:38,337
You know what I'm saying?

1265
00:47:38,404 --> 00:47:42,575
Damn! She said, "You wanna
come inside and talk..."

1266
00:47:44,043 --> 00:47:48,515
She definitely wanted it.
Right? Right?

1267
00:47:48,581 --> 00:47:50,516
Baby, I just wanted you
to know that you were right!

1268
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:52,219
You hit the nail on the head.

1269
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,987
<i>- Babe, listen.
- You had the hammer!</i>

1270
00:47:54,054 --> 00:47:56,256
We gonna send his heathen ass
to Catholic school!

1271
00:47:56,322 --> 00:47:58,391
<i>- Babe, stop it!
- I'm gonna call the Catholics.</i>

1272
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:00,060
I'm gonna call Jesus.
Somebody call some Marys.

1273
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,196
<i>- Okay...
- The Holy Cross, we coming!</i>

1274
00:48:02,261 --> 00:48:04,063
You and your lady having problems?

1275
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,899
I can help. You know
I have counseling services.

1276
00:48:06,965 --> 00:48:09,335
I got single, I got couple,
I got group.

1277
00:48:09,402 --> 00:48:12,072
<i>If you choose groups,
the responsibilities would be</i>

1278
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,740
to bring in cookies and, or,

1279
00:48:13,806 --> 00:48:15,841
fruit punch every third meeting.

1280
00:48:17,377 --> 00:48:20,413
No, thank you, man. I'm good.
We don't need no damn session.

1281
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,449
Here, man. Here's the check.

1282
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:25,285
Calvin, before I take that check,

1283
00:48:25,351 --> 00:48:27,554
I'm going to tell you,
it's non-refundable.

1284
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:28,788
If I take that check,

1285
00:48:28,855 --> 00:48:30,156
that check goes away.

1286
00:48:30,223 --> 00:48:33,927
And if you don't have that
remaining balance on Monday,

1287
00:48:33,993 --> 00:48:35,194
I promise you,

1288
00:48:35,261 --> 00:48:38,063
it is not a homing pigeon,
it does not come back.

1289
00:48:38,130 --> 00:48:40,199
You know how Mike Tyson has
those birds on that roof?

1290
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:43,403
He can let those birds go.
"Go, go!" You know?

1291
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:46,639
Birds fly around,
birds come back on his hand.

1292
00:48:46,706 --> 00:48:47,941
He looks at that bird.

1293
00:48:48,007 --> 00:48:49,942
Right?

1294
00:48:50,009 --> 00:48:51,378
That ain't gonna happen.
You understand?

1295
00:48:51,444 --> 00:48:52,778
I know what non-refundable means.

1296
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,313
It's forfeited.

1297
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,116
I just wanna let you know.
'Cause you're my man.

1298
00:48:56,181 --> 00:48:59,520
Damn, man. Is it One-Stop
or nonstop? Take the check.

1299
00:49:02,355 --> 00:49:05,157
Certified check. Nice.

1300
00:49:05,225 --> 00:49:08,261
It's a pleasure doing
business with you, Calvin.

1301
00:49:08,328 --> 00:49:09,829
I'm gonna hold off
on that handshake

1302
00:49:09,895 --> 00:49:13,766
until you make that remaining
balance payment on Monday.

1303
00:49:13,833 --> 00:49:16,935
Just in case
you do some nigga shit.

1304
00:49:17,002 --> 00:49:19,305
Hey, don't tell nobody.

1305
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:22,442
It's going down
this weekend, y'all!

1306
00:49:22,507 --> 00:49:24,109
Jackie, what are you
talking about now?

1307
00:49:24,177 --> 00:49:26,480
<i>Girl, my husband's
got me all stressed out.</i>

1308
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,616
Police got him working
back-to-back double shifts.

1309
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:32,686
Okay. I just need
a little touch up now, Angie.

1310
00:49:32,752 --> 00:49:34,319
Touch up?

1311
00:49:35,788 --> 00:49:37,790
No. No, baby,
you got to pull them roots

1312
00:49:37,857 --> 00:49:39,692
all the way up like a turnip...

1313
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,293
<i>Turn it over, ball it</i>

1314
00:49:41,360 --> 00:49:42,929
and then put it back in your head.

1315
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:45,831
Jackie, I mean, no shade,

1316
00:49:45,898 --> 00:49:47,167
but, God, you should be ashamed

1317
00:49:47,232 --> 00:49:48,467
to walk out the house like this.

1318
00:49:48,534 --> 00:49:50,536
Girl, how you gonna say,
"No shade,"

1319
00:49:50,603 --> 00:49:52,873
and then shade
the shit out that lady.

1320
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,273
<i>Thank you.</i>

1321
00:49:54,339 --> 00:49:56,676
Y'all know the boy
that got shot didn't make it.

1322
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:57,844
My God. That's terrible.

1323
00:49:59,011 --> 00:50:00,112
No.

1324
00:50:00,179 --> 00:50:02,281
Pronounced him dead this morning.

1325
00:50:02,348 --> 00:50:04,351
<i>My husband said that
this whole thing started</i>

1326
00:50:04,417 --> 00:50:05,518
because of some fight

1327
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,788
that happened over there
at the high school.

1328
00:50:08,788 --> 00:50:10,189
Y'all know what happened last time

1329
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,824
one of their leaders got killed.

1330
00:50:11,891 --> 00:50:12,992
It was a bloodbath.

1331
00:50:13,058 --> 00:50:14,659
Well, the police chief's
planning on

1332
00:50:14,726 --> 00:50:16,663
doubling the amount of cops
on the streets this weekend.

1333
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:18,398
Man, I'm so tired of this mess!

1334
00:50:18,464 --> 00:50:19,832
<i>Every time I turn around,</i>

1335
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,835
somebody is killing somebody
over nothing.

1336
00:50:21,902 --> 00:50:22,936
<i>And what are we supposed to do?</i>

1337
00:50:23,002 --> 00:50:25,138
Lock our doors, don't snitch.

1338
00:50:25,205 --> 00:50:27,172
Pretend like this shit is normal?

1339
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:28,875
This is bullshit,
this is not normal.

1340
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:31,144
Then we gotta do
something about it.

1341
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:32,412
Shorties out here wiling

1342
00:50:32,478 --> 00:50:34,681
and that's our fault.
That's on us.

1343
00:50:34,748 --> 00:50:37,383
Look, if we get people
to come to the shop,

1344
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:40,052
I don't care what neighborhood
they from. They from Chatham,

1345
00:50:40,119 --> 00:50:43,255
<i>from Englewood, East Side,
crazy, wherever they from,</i>

1346
00:50:43,322 --> 00:50:44,757
we just need people from the city

1347
00:50:44,824 --> 00:50:47,427
to come meet up in the shop,
and we just talk.

1348
00:50:47,493 --> 00:50:48,827
<i>And give them a chance to speak.</i>

1349
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:50,362
They're gonna come up with ideas.

1350
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:52,598
I think that's a great idea,
Rashad.

1351
00:50:52,665 --> 00:50:54,634
Really great idea, baby.

1352
00:50:55,534 --> 00:50:57,036
Well, I say we do it.

1353
00:50:57,103 --> 00:50:58,703
<i>Y'all know we have to do it.</i>

1354
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,038
I mean, the gangs have us scared.

1355
00:51:00,105 --> 00:51:01,407
They're killing everybody.

1356
00:51:01,473 --> 00:51:03,342
<i>We don't wanna
walk outside anymore.</i>

1357
00:51:03,409 --> 00:51:05,411
Them people downtown,
they aren't moving for us.

1358
00:51:05,478 --> 00:51:06,779
I mean, if we don't do something,

1359
00:51:06,846 --> 00:51:08,548
no one's gonna save our community.

1360
00:51:08,614 --> 00:51:10,516
We gotta take our streets back.

1361
00:51:22,328 --> 00:51:23,562
<i>Action, LeShawn!</i>

1362
00:51:23,630 --> 00:51:25,064
<i>Stacia! Sorry, action, Stacia!</i>

1363
00:51:25,130 --> 00:51:26,431
Stop the violence, y'all!

1364
00:51:26,498 --> 00:51:28,466
Exactly. Calvin's Shop.

1365
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:29,603
<i>That's what I'm talking about!</i>

1366
00:51:29,668 --> 00:51:30,936
Come on, man!

1367
00:51:31,002 --> 00:51:31,904
<i>You watch that booty shaking!</i>

1368
00:51:31,971 --> 00:51:33,473
- Calvin's Shop...
- Listen, guys!

1369
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,308
We know you don't
care about your community,

1370
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:37,243
but you gotta care about this.

1371
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,610
<i>Please come down
to Calvin's Shop tonight</i>

1372
00:51:38,677 --> 00:51:39,878
for the community summit,

1373
00:51:39,946 --> 00:51:41,614
because dreams apparently

1374
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,616
are being deferred
even as we speak.

1375
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,552
Yeah! I think we got it.

1376
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:49,488
Okay.

1377
00:51:54,293 --> 00:51:56,029
<i>Move!</i>

1378
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,898
<i>Get it! Get it! Get it! Get it!</i>

1379
00:51:58,965 --> 00:52:01,000
<i>You can look, but do not touch.</i>

1380
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:02,335
<i>Look back at it.</i>

1381
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:04,136
<i>- You like that?
- I'm good.</i>

1382
00:52:04,203 --> 00:52:05,338
<i>We're out in the street, you know.</i>

1383
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:06,505
<i>This isn't the privacy
of your own bedroom.</i>

1384
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:07,641
<i>Yeah, girl!</i>

1385
00:52:16,181 --> 00:52:18,350
<i>We wanna thank
y'all for being here.</i>

1386
00:52:18,418 --> 00:52:20,820
There's still seats
available if you need a seat.

1387
00:52:20,886 --> 00:52:22,087
It's important
that we all are here

1388
00:52:22,154 --> 00:52:23,656
because this is our community.

1389
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:25,157
<i>And it's up to us to change it,</i>

1390
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:27,427
<i>so, we wanna hear y'all ideas.</i>

1391
00:52:27,493 --> 00:52:29,461
I was thinking more like
a benefit concert.

1392
00:52:29,529 --> 00:52:31,264
You know, something for the kids.

1393
00:52:31,331 --> 00:52:32,832
<i>I think we should just
call up Kanye</i>

1394
00:52:32,897 --> 00:52:34,366
and have him come on out
and perform.

1395
00:52:34,433 --> 00:52:36,002
Yes!

1396
00:52:36,868 --> 00:52:38,637
He ain't coming around y'all

1397
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:41,208
broke negroes.
Are you serious right now?

1398
00:52:41,273 --> 00:52:43,208
<i>Look, Kanye a Kardashian now.</i>

1399
00:52:43,275 --> 00:52:45,011
He wears dresses now.

1400
00:52:45,076 --> 00:52:47,045
I seen him on TV,
he had a skirt on.

1401
00:52:47,112 --> 00:52:48,313
His knees were showing.

1402
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:50,616
All right, all right,
all right. Relax!

1403
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:53,019
What about R. Kelly?

1404
00:52:53,085 --> 00:52:54,219
What?

1405
00:52:54,286 --> 00:52:56,288
R. Kelly? For a kids benefit?

1406
00:52:56,355 --> 00:52:57,823
Kelly love the kids.

1407
00:52:57,891 --> 00:52:59,993
Yeah, he can teach them
how to make home movies.

1408
00:53:00,058 --> 00:53:01,159
No, he didn't.

1409
00:53:01,226 --> 00:53:03,696
All right, already!
Leave him alone!

1410
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,965
Do you realize
how much good quality

1411
00:53:06,031 --> 00:53:07,465
R&B we have missed out on,

1412
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:09,902
because y'all keep bringing up
that same old bull?

1413
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:11,304
<i>- Da...
- The last albums he made,</i>

1414
00:53:11,371 --> 00:53:14,574
Them albums was made
out of pure stress.

1415
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:17,342
Does anybody else
have any other ideas?

1416
00:53:17,409 --> 00:53:19,344
I'd like to say something.

1417
00:53:19,411 --> 00:53:20,980
Look, Eddie, you once said

1418
00:53:21,047 --> 00:53:22,882
that the barbershop is the
pillar of the neighborhood.

1419
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,184
Damn right!

1420
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,685
So we use that, right?

1421
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,154
We turn the shop into our
safe space for the weekend.

1422
00:53:28,221 --> 00:53:29,589
<i>All right? Neutral grounds
where both sides</i>

1423
00:53:29,656 --> 00:53:30,889
can come together peacefully.

1424
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:32,424
<i>I like that. Yeah.</i>

1425
00:53:32,491 --> 00:53:33,692
Turn this place into Switzerland.

1426
00:53:33,759 --> 00:53:34,993
Exactly!

1427
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:36,528
Ain't no way in hell
the South Side

1428
00:53:36,596 --> 00:53:38,831
is ever going to resemble
any parts of Switzerland.

1429
00:53:38,898 --> 00:53:40,600
I don't even know no black Swiss.

1430
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:41,833
I mean, Swizz Beatz.

1431
00:53:41,900 --> 00:53:43,034
<i>Is he black?</i>

1432
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:44,203
<i>Or is he white?</i>

1433
00:53:44,270 --> 00:53:46,072
You know, he is a little beige.

1434
00:53:46,139 --> 00:53:48,241
<i>He might be Swiss. I mean...</i>

1435
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,944
He named himself to it.
So, he's Swiss. He's Swiss.

1436
00:53:51,009 --> 00:53:52,111
<i>Can we get back to it?</i>

1437
00:53:52,177 --> 00:53:54,013
We could try to get
both sides to come together

1438
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,915
and agree to a ceasefire.

1439
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:57,516
<i>And then we can
get the Chicago celebs</i>

1440
00:53:57,583 --> 00:53:59,118
to tweet about it
and talk about it.

1441
00:53:59,185 --> 00:54:00,552
Get them to support.

1442
00:54:00,619 --> 00:54:01,888
That's good, Jerrod.

1443
00:54:01,955 --> 00:54:03,255
You know what, he's right.

1444
00:54:03,322 --> 00:54:05,859
That means that we have
to give them something to see.

1445
00:54:05,924 --> 00:54:07,859
Yeah, maybe we could
just give away free gifts.

1446
00:54:07,927 --> 00:54:09,195
Like a radio promotion.

1447
00:54:09,261 --> 00:54:10,462
Yes!

1448
00:54:10,529 --> 00:54:12,031
And who's supposed to pay
for these free gifts?

1449
00:54:12,098 --> 00:54:16,201
Draya is right, we need some
incentive to bring people out.

1450
00:54:16,268 --> 00:54:18,069
I don't want to state
the obvious here,

1451
00:54:18,136 --> 00:54:19,905
but this is a barbershop.

1452
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:22,741
We could just do what
we already do. For free.

1453
00:54:22,808 --> 00:54:24,243
Free cuts the whole weekend?

1454
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,545
You know how much money
we pull in on Saturday alone?

1455
00:54:26,612 --> 00:54:28,147
Do you know how much
we're gonna lose

1456
00:54:28,214 --> 00:54:29,215
if that enclosure happens?

1457
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,551
It's a great idea, Calvin.

1458
00:54:31,618 --> 00:54:33,052
<i>It is. It is a great idea.</i>

1459
00:54:33,118 --> 00:54:34,620
Yeah, a 48-hour ceasefire,

1460
00:54:34,686 --> 00:54:37,556
with unlimited free cuts
and styling.

1461
00:54:37,623 --> 00:54:39,793
I mean, come on,
who could turn that down?

1462
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:42,094
I... I propose that Gangsta Grub

1463
00:54:42,161 --> 00:54:43,496
be the official caterer for this.

1464
00:54:43,561 --> 00:54:45,130
Yeah, I bet you would.

1465
00:54:45,197 --> 00:54:46,598
Hell, yeah, dude!
You know how much money

1466
00:54:46,665 --> 00:54:47,833
I can make out on these streets

1467
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,068
in a 48-hour spa...

1468
00:54:50,302 --> 00:54:52,772
To donate
to the Boys and Girls Club!

1469
00:54:52,837 --> 00:54:54,172
That's R. Kelly's favorite.

1470
00:54:54,239 --> 00:54:55,908
<i>Listen here, Bollyhood!</i>

1471
00:54:55,975 --> 00:54:57,444
Leave Kels alone, God damn it,

1472
00:54:57,509 --> 00:54:59,145
I say, God damn it,
leave Kels alone!

1473
00:55:00,246 --> 00:55:01,948
Sorry about that, go ahead.

1474
00:55:02,014 --> 00:55:03,984
Then I think that we have a plan!

1475
00:55:10,824 --> 00:55:13,659
Hold up, hold up.
We've got one little problem.

1476
00:55:13,726 --> 00:55:15,462
<i>Y'all know to have a ceasefire,</i>

1477
00:55:15,527 --> 00:55:18,665
we got to get the shot callers
to call a truce.

1478
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,199
<i>Y'all know what happened
the last time</i>

1479
00:55:20,266 --> 00:55:22,435
we got Marquis and Jay up in here.

1480
00:55:22,502 --> 00:55:23,969
It was damn near World War III.

1481
00:55:24,036 --> 00:55:25,272
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

1482
00:55:26,873 --> 00:55:28,107
But you know what? What if we made

1483
00:55:28,174 --> 00:55:29,609
that mix-up happen again?

1484
00:55:43,889 --> 00:55:45,824
<i>This is just a terrible idea.</i>

1485
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:47,393
Yeah.
"Let's cause a little mix-up.

1486
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:49,295
"Let's make that mix-up
happen again."

1487
00:55:49,362 --> 00:55:50,663
That was the dumbest thing
you ever said.

1488
00:55:50,730 --> 00:55:51,998
Do you know who these people are?

1489
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,299
<i>They are murderers.</i>

1490
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:54,867
<i>They don't work at the grocery
store, and if they did,</i>

1491
00:55:54,933 --> 00:55:56,835
they would be butchers.

1492
00:55:56,902 --> 00:55:58,069
Quiet!

1493
00:55:58,136 --> 00:56:01,005
Thank God you wore
a G-Unit bulletproof vest.

1494
00:56:01,072 --> 00:56:02,908
Yeah, it worked for 50!

1495
00:56:02,976 --> 00:56:07,179
No, it didn't, actually.
He got shot in the face!

1496
00:56:07,246 --> 00:56:09,248
He got shot in the face?

1497
00:56:09,315 --> 00:56:11,150
Draya! What's up, baby girl?

1498
00:56:12,585 --> 00:56:14,019
Hold up, Calvin!
What's going on in here?

1499
00:56:14,085 --> 00:56:15,854
Is this a set-up?

1500
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,889
Listen to me. Jay! Jay!

1501
00:56:17,956 --> 00:56:19,290
No, stop!

1502
00:56:19,357 --> 00:56:20,658
<i>Hold on, hold on, hold on.</i>

1503
00:56:20,726 --> 00:56:22,595
Hold on!

1504
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:24,163
Hold on! Wait a minute!

1505
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:25,598
I wish you would, boy!

1506
00:56:25,665 --> 00:56:26,900
Listen! Now, I've been
knowing you guys

1507
00:56:26,965 --> 00:56:28,534
for about 20 years, man.

1508
00:56:28,601 --> 00:56:29,936
My father used to cut
both of your heads!

1509
00:56:30,002 --> 00:56:31,371
Come on, bruh.

1510
00:56:31,436 --> 00:56:33,538
Out of respect for him and
the shop, man, hear us out.

1511
00:56:33,605 --> 00:56:35,507
We're asking y'all
for ten minutes.

1512
00:56:35,574 --> 00:56:37,476
<i>That's all we asking for, bruh.</i>

1513
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:42,114
I need more time, God.

1514
00:56:42,181 --> 00:56:43,683
I don't wanna die a virgin.

1515
00:56:43,750 --> 00:56:45,117
Come on, Jason.

1516
00:56:45,183 --> 00:56:46,551
Come on, G. Come on, man.

1517
00:56:46,618 --> 00:56:48,186
<i>Let's do this, man.</i>

1518
00:56:48,253 --> 00:56:49,422
Have a seat.

1519
00:56:58,163 --> 00:56:59,598
We all good. Come on, big boy.

1520
00:56:59,665 --> 00:57:02,468
Sit on down for a second. Get on.

1521
00:57:16,047 --> 00:57:17,250
Are we good?

1522
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:21,587
Hey, Rev.

1523
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:24,857
15 fish dinners for bingo night?

1524
00:57:24,924 --> 00:57:26,726
Hell, yeah!

1525
00:57:26,792 --> 00:57:28,360
I mean, praise God!

1526
00:57:28,427 --> 00:57:30,730
How about some
sweet potato pie? All right.

1527
00:57:31,931 --> 00:57:34,266
All right! What's cooking?
Daddy's home!

1528
00:57:34,333 --> 00:57:35,535
J.D., don't come up in here

1529
00:57:35,601 --> 00:57:36,868
with all that shit today, okay?

1530
00:57:36,935 --> 00:57:37,703
We don't have time for that shit.

1531
00:57:37,770 --> 00:57:39,071
- Okay?
- Mabel.

1532
00:57:39,138 --> 00:57:41,574
What did I ask you to do?
More of this. More parsley.

1533
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:43,676
<i>Okay? You? You better hurry it up!</i>

1534
00:57:43,743 --> 00:57:45,612
Okay, I don't even know why he
got a goddamn hairnet on.

1535
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:48,014
He don't even have no hair.
You guys are tripping!

1536
00:57:48,081 --> 00:57:49,248
<i>- That's good.
- Lord have mercy.</i>

1537
00:57:49,315 --> 00:57:50,950
More flour. Put some more.
Don't be scared.

1538
00:57:51,016 --> 00:57:52,252
You didn't buy it!

1539
00:57:52,317 --> 00:57:53,552
<i>It's gotta be out of here by 2:00.</i>

1540
00:57:53,618 --> 00:57:54,720
You have a break yet?

1541
00:57:54,788 --> 00:57:56,222
Knead it, knead it! Knead it

1542
00:57:56,288 --> 00:57:58,090
like you knead a bitch's ass.
Okay?

1543
00:57:58,157 --> 00:57:59,759
- Come on!
- Mabel.

1544
00:57:59,826 --> 00:58:01,260
What happened to us
giving them a break?

1545
00:58:01,326 --> 00:58:02,395
For what?

1546
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:03,862
We've got to keep
the talent healthy.

1547
00:58:03,929 --> 00:58:05,364
Negro, I'm the talent.

1548
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:09,469
You got me twisted on there,
talking about the talent.

1549
00:58:09,534 --> 00:58:11,870
You ain't doing shit out there
worth a damn...

1550
00:58:11,936 --> 00:58:14,139
You may be the talent,
but I'm the face.

1551
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:15,507
<i>All right?</i>

1552
00:58:17,342 --> 00:58:18,743
Look, Nana...

1553
00:58:18,810 --> 00:58:22,981
We don't want this gravy train
to stop flowing anytime soon.

1554
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:25,884
Look at that?

1555
00:58:26,853 --> 00:58:28,555
That's just from this morning.

1556
00:58:29,654 --> 00:58:31,389
Talent! You all take five.

1557
00:58:31,456 --> 00:58:32,657
Go.

1558
00:58:32,725 --> 00:58:34,326
Talent, take six.

1559
00:58:38,331 --> 00:58:40,032
<i>I know it seems like a lot.</i>

1560
00:58:40,098 --> 00:58:41,734
But we just asking for two days.

1561
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:44,770
Two days and no bloodshed.

1562
00:58:44,837 --> 00:58:46,105
Exactly, gentlemen.

1563
00:58:46,172 --> 00:58:48,307
Not to oversell it,
but what's gonna happen is,

1564
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:49,574
<i>you guys go home for the weekend,</i>

1565
00:58:49,641 --> 00:58:51,275
<i>and all your friends on Friday</i>

1566
00:58:51,342 --> 00:58:53,245
will still be alive
come Monday morning.

1567
00:58:54,647 --> 00:58:55,915
It's not a bad deal.

1568
00:59:03,322 --> 00:59:04,557
Why'd I do that?

1569
00:59:04,623 --> 00:59:07,359
Look, all we trying to say,
man, is,

1570
00:59:07,427 --> 00:59:09,829
<i>we got sons,
I know y'all got kids,</i>

1571
00:59:09,895 --> 00:59:11,330
<i>and we just trying to make sure</i>

1572
00:59:11,397 --> 00:59:13,464
our kids get to their
18th birthday.

1573
00:59:13,531 --> 00:59:15,100
And 19th and 20th.

1574
00:59:15,168 --> 00:59:17,336
<i>And it gotta start somewhere, man.</i>

1575
00:59:17,402 --> 00:59:19,638
And we say it starts here
this weekend

1576
00:59:19,705 --> 00:59:21,107
for two days.

1577
00:59:21,906 --> 00:59:23,808
<i>But we need y'all.</i>

1578
00:59:23,875 --> 00:59:25,844
<i>Y'all the shot callers.</i>

1579
00:59:25,911 --> 00:59:28,047
We just need y'all
to call some shots.

1580
00:59:49,768 --> 00:59:51,136
I'm in.

1581
00:59:52,705 --> 00:59:54,641
Because of you, Cal.

1582
00:59:55,741 --> 00:59:57,243
Appreciate it, man.

1583
01:00:03,648 --> 01:00:05,051
I got you.

1584
01:00:08,654 --> 01:00:09,722
All right, everybody,

1585
01:00:09,788 --> 01:00:11,556
<i>we're good to go this weekend.</i>

1586
01:00:11,623 --> 01:00:13,426
All right, there we go.

1587
01:00:13,491 --> 01:00:14,627
Let's get ready.

1588
01:00:14,692 --> 01:00:15,794
Yes, sir.

1589
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:18,531
Hey, thanks for taking care
of me earlier, Rashad.

1590
01:00:18,598 --> 01:00:20,500
- I really appreciate it.
- We all good.

1591
01:00:21,167 --> 01:00:22,634
And...

1592
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:25,003
Thanks for giving me
a ride home the other night.

1593
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:27,273
You were a real gentleman,
Shady-Shad.

1594
01:00:33,511 --> 01:00:35,246
<i>So you took the bitch home.</i>

1595
01:00:35,313 --> 01:00:37,616
Look, she needed a ride home
so I gave her a ride home.

1596
01:00:37,683 --> 01:00:38,851
I'm a good dude.

1597
01:00:38,917 --> 01:00:40,386
It was night time,
she was by herself.

1598
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:41,987
I wasn't gonna leave her
out there.

1599
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:43,422
It's crazy out there. What
else was I supposed to do?

1600
01:00:43,489 --> 01:00:45,023
Draya works in a barbershop.

1601
01:00:45,089 --> 01:00:46,292
There were plenty
of other good dudes

1602
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:47,393
who could've taken her home.

1603
01:00:47,460 --> 01:00:48,659
Why'd you have to be the one?

1604
01:00:48,726 --> 01:00:49,895
Because it was on the way.

1605
01:00:49,962 --> 01:00:51,129
Bullshit!

1606
01:00:51,196 --> 01:00:52,565
I know girls like Draya.

1607
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:55,134
I see through her fake lashes,
and her watermelon ass,

1608
01:00:55,201 --> 01:00:57,136
and her whole
damsel-in-distress routine.

1609
01:00:57,201 --> 01:00:58,736
She wants you, Rashad.

1610
01:00:58,804 --> 01:01:01,072
Are you dumb enough
to fall into that girl's trap?

1611
01:01:01,139 --> 01:01:02,273
Terri...

1612
01:01:02,340 --> 01:01:04,210
You come home every other night

1613
01:01:04,275 --> 01:01:06,645
from some video shoot
or some athlete's commercial.

1614
01:01:06,712 --> 01:01:08,447
Do I ever question it?

1615
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:10,282
No, because I trust you.

1616
01:01:10,348 --> 01:01:12,617
I know you hold me down,
I'm holding you down.

1617
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:15,087
I don't care,
I don't like that bitch.

1618
01:01:15,154 --> 01:01:17,056
Look, I promise you...

1619
01:01:17,123 --> 01:01:19,891
I promise you, there's nothing
going on with me and Draya.

1620
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:21,493
I need you to know that, okay?

1621
01:01:23,395 --> 01:01:24,496
Pull your pants down.

1622
01:01:24,563 --> 01:01:25,732
What?

1623
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:26,831
Pull your pants down,
we're doing it.

1624
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:28,132
What the hell are you doing, girl?

1625
01:01:28,199 --> 01:01:29,968
Stepping up my lazy
side booty game.

1626
01:01:30,036 --> 01:01:31,070
- Let's go.
- Yo, chill out.

1627
01:01:31,136 --> 01:01:32,403
- Be quiet.
- I am being quiet.

1628
01:01:32,471 --> 01:01:33,540
You're gonna wake her up.

1629
01:01:33,605 --> 01:01:35,139
I don't care, we can be quiet.
Let's go.

1630
01:01:35,206 --> 01:01:36,808
Chill out! Chill out! Look...

1631
01:01:36,875 --> 01:01:39,110
We ain't having sex on demand,
I ain't no piece of meat.

1632
01:01:39,177 --> 01:01:40,679
- "Let's go." Look...
- Whatever.

1633
01:01:41,746 --> 01:01:43,081
Get up in it.

1634
01:01:45,217 --> 01:01:46,920
Get up in it. Now!

1635
01:01:48,186 --> 01:01:49,688
I mean...

1636
01:01:49,755 --> 01:01:52,325
I am aroused though,
I ain't gonna lie.

1637
01:01:52,391 --> 01:01:54,860
But I got this sofrito sauce
on the stove, I'll be back.

1638
01:01:54,927 --> 01:01:57,597
What? You're just
proving my point!

1639
01:01:57,663 --> 01:02:00,065
And your sofrito sauce
don't taste better than me!

1640
01:02:04,002 --> 01:02:06,004
You're not going nowhere.

1641
01:02:07,308 --> 01:02:08,541
Not this weekend.

1642
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:10,676
It's too crazy out there
on them streets.

1643
01:02:10,743 --> 01:02:12,511
But, Dad, there's a three on
three tournament this weekend!

1644
01:02:12,578 --> 01:02:14,513
I don't care about no basketball.

1645
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:15,947
Do you know your mama found

1646
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:17,917
gang paraphernalia in your drawer?

1647
01:02:18,683 --> 01:02:20,485
In my house!

1648
01:02:20,552 --> 01:02:21,987
Now how am I supposed
to trust you?

1649
01:02:22,054 --> 01:02:23,722
Man, this ain't fair!

1650
01:02:23,788 --> 01:02:26,157
None of my team has gotta deal
with these stupid rules!

1651
01:02:26,225 --> 01:02:27,993
You know why? Do you know why?

1652
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,694
Because most of those knuckleheads

1653
01:02:29,761 --> 01:02:31,663
ain't even got a father
to look out for them anyway.

1654
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:33,165
But they look out for me.

1655
01:02:33,232 --> 01:02:34,532
When I'm at school,

1656
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,002
my boys are the ones
that got my back.

1657
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:38,302
Who you talking about?
You talking about Kenny?

1658
01:02:38,369 --> 01:02:40,639
You think that's your boy?

1659
01:02:40,706 --> 01:02:43,176
Why you always gotta say
something about Kenny?

1660
01:02:43,241 --> 01:02:44,877
Aren't you and Uncle Shad
like brothers?

1661
01:02:44,944 --> 01:02:46,677
- Why you always tripping?
- Hey!

1662
01:02:46,744 --> 01:02:48,413
You watch your mouth, Jalen!

1663
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:50,917
Now, I'm not one of
your friends, okay?

1664
01:02:50,984 --> 01:02:52,484
I don't see
why you don't understand

1665
01:02:52,551 --> 01:02:54,152
how dangerous it is out there

1666
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:57,089
and that we don't approve of
who you're associating with!

1667
01:02:57,156 --> 01:02:58,324
What? You want me to hang out

1668
01:02:58,389 --> 01:02:59,558
with the cornball
that cleans the shop?

1669
01:02:59,625 --> 01:03:00,826
What's wrong with Anthony?

1670
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:02,895
Why is it corny to be smart?

1671
01:03:02,962 --> 01:03:05,429
Why is it corny
to do what you ask?

1672
01:03:05,496 --> 01:03:07,933
Why is it corny
to handle your business?

1673
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,770
That's not corny, son.
That's being a man.

1674
01:03:15,241 --> 01:03:17,877
Look, J... I know you're mad.

1675
01:03:17,944 --> 01:03:19,244
I know you're upset.

1676
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,912
But listen,

1677
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:22,748
you gotta realize
how lucky you are

1678
01:03:22,813 --> 01:03:24,116
to have two parents

1679
01:03:24,183 --> 01:03:26,051
that wanna know where you are,
what you're doing,

1680
01:03:26,118 --> 01:03:27,886
who you're associating with.

1681
01:03:27,953 --> 01:03:29,088
That's important.

1682
01:03:29,154 --> 01:03:30,656
You're lucky.

1683
01:03:31,924 --> 01:03:33,192
I don't feel lucky.

1684
01:03:34,592 --> 01:03:36,895
My life would be so much
better if you wasn't in it.

1685
01:03:36,962 --> 01:03:38,297
What? What'd you say? Jalen!

1686
01:03:38,362 --> 01:03:39,931
- Did you hear him?
- Baby, please wait! Hey!

1687
01:03:39,998 --> 01:03:41,199
Hey, boy!

1688
01:03:41,266 --> 01:03:42,435
Did you hear what he said?

1689
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:43,768
I know, but listen,
he didn't mean it!

1690
01:03:43,835 --> 01:03:46,104
He's angry and he's 14.

1691
01:03:46,172 --> 01:03:48,307
Well, I'm angry
and I'm older than 14.

1692
01:03:48,373 --> 01:03:50,208
- Boy, you ain't white!
- Okay, babe...

1693
01:03:50,275 --> 01:03:52,778
Listen, at some point,
he's gonna realize

1694
01:03:52,844 --> 01:03:54,813
that we're doing all of this
because we love him.

1695
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:56,782
- But he's not a tough guy.
- I know.

1696
01:03:56,848 --> 01:03:59,451
He's trying to act like it.
Boy, you not a tough guy!

1697
01:03:59,518 --> 01:04:01,387
Hey, I know that.

1698
01:04:01,453 --> 01:04:03,488
South Side's no place to flex.

1699
01:04:05,558 --> 01:04:07,993
You ain't got it like that,
you need to ease back

1700
01:04:08,060 --> 01:04:10,462
'cause the consequences
out here are way too thin.

1701
01:04:10,529 --> 01:04:13,331
I know, but clearly,
he's going through something.

1702
01:04:14,500 --> 01:04:17,469
But you and me?
We raised a smart kid.

1703
01:04:17,536 --> 01:04:19,138
He's gonna turn around.

1704
01:04:19,203 --> 01:04:20,339
Trust me.

1705
01:04:22,241 --> 01:04:23,743
Hope so.

1706
01:04:26,378 --> 01:04:30,315
<i>Unlike New York and LA,
there has been a spike</i>

1707
01:04:30,382 --> 01:04:33,452
<i>in the number of homicides
in Chicago in the last year.</i>

1708
01:04:33,518 --> 01:04:36,087
You think anybody who's not
a regular will show up?

1709
01:04:36,154 --> 01:04:39,358
Yeah, everyone likes free shit.

1710
01:04:39,424 --> 01:04:41,627
That's not exactly what
we're doing this for though.

1711
01:04:41,692 --> 01:04:43,328
You really think
the neighborhood's gonna agree

1712
01:04:43,395 --> 01:04:45,264
to be peaceful for two days?

1713
01:04:45,331 --> 01:04:47,633
I can't think of the last time
we went two hours

1714
01:04:47,699 --> 01:04:49,835
without gunfire popping off
around here.

1715
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:52,003
We gonna make it happen
this weekend.

1716
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:53,806
So what? What happens after that?

1717
01:04:53,873 --> 01:04:55,706
The enclosure
just magically stops?

1718
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:57,942
Exactly. It ain't like politicians

1719
01:04:58,009 --> 01:04:59,511
really listen to the people
anyway.

1720
01:04:59,578 --> 01:05:00,880
<i>So we're gonna make them listen.</i>

1721
01:05:00,946 --> 01:05:02,315
The shop staying open

1722
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:03,982
depends on the success
of this ceasefire

1723
01:05:04,049 --> 01:05:05,485
and how much press we get.

1724
01:05:05,551 --> 01:05:07,552
Check this out. I already
created a Twitter campaign.

1725
01:05:07,618 --> 01:05:09,287
# BarbershopSaves TheNeighborhood.

1726
01:05:09,355 --> 01:05:11,824
Now, look, we get a few
celebrities to tweet that out,

1727
01:05:11,891 --> 01:05:13,058
we'll go viral in no time.

1728
01:05:13,125 --> 01:05:14,693
I'll tell you what.

1729
01:05:14,759 --> 01:05:16,995
If you can get this to be
a trending topic on Twitter,

1730
01:05:17,063 --> 01:05:18,363
I'll vote Democrat
the next election.

1731
01:05:18,429 --> 01:05:19,632
Deal.

1732
01:05:19,699 --> 01:05:21,800
This just got very interesting.

1733
01:05:21,866 --> 01:05:23,334
- What up, everybody?
- Yo-yo.

1734
01:05:23,402 --> 01:05:25,304
- Am I early or late?
- Both.

1735
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:26,439
My man.

1736
01:05:29,942 --> 01:05:31,409
Come on.

1737
01:05:32,944 --> 01:05:35,913
I don't think we should.
What do you think?

1738
01:05:35,980 --> 01:05:37,315
Made him get in
the game injured, man.

1739
01:05:37,382 --> 01:05:39,417
That's why we
couldn't do nothing last week.

1740
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:41,821
Head must tilt a certain way.

1741
01:05:41,886 --> 01:05:43,087
I'm just fond of shit.

1742
01:05:43,154 --> 01:05:44,723
I like that.

1743
01:05:44,790 --> 01:05:46,824
<i>I'll set that down there.</i>

1744
01:05:46,891 --> 01:05:48,125
<i>Thank you! Appreciate it.</i>

1745
01:05:48,192 --> 01:05:49,795
<i>Thank you for the work.
Appreciate it.</i>

1746
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:04,877
This is low as I can go really.

1747
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:07,246
I can't go much lower
than this now.

1748
01:06:07,313 --> 01:06:08,313
Is this decaf?

1749
01:06:08,380 --> 01:06:09,381
Yeah, cold brew's for me.

1750
01:06:09,447 --> 01:06:10,614
Good looking out, A.

1751
01:06:10,681 --> 01:06:12,884
Yeah, no problem.

1752
01:06:12,951 --> 01:06:14,587
All right, my man.
Thanks for coming.

1753
01:06:14,652 --> 01:06:16,421
- Yo, who next?
- I got you, Cal.

1754
01:06:24,830 --> 01:06:26,165
There you go.

1755
01:06:27,098 --> 01:06:28,699
<i>How is it out there?</i>

1756
01:06:28,766 --> 01:06:31,536
Streets is quiet, feels good.

1757
01:06:31,603 --> 01:06:32,905
It's actually starting to feel
a little normal.

1758
01:06:32,971 --> 01:06:34,639
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

1759
01:06:34,706 --> 01:06:35,840
All right, ma.

1760
01:06:35,907 --> 01:06:36,976
Bye, Anthony-Shmanthony.

1761
01:06:41,212 --> 01:06:43,715
Girl, I know.

1762
01:06:43,781 --> 01:06:45,717
That was probably crazy.

1763
01:06:45,784 --> 01:06:47,552
<i>Bitch, we've been in here
17 hours.</i>

1764
01:06:47,619 --> 01:06:49,253
<i>You know, I am half delirious.</i>

1765
01:06:50,522 --> 01:06:52,257
<i>So what'd he say?</i>

1766
01:06:52,324 --> 01:06:54,226
Angie, do you wanna get that?

1767
01:06:57,061 --> 01:06:58,496
<i>Stop, Tewana, stop! What the fuck?</i>

1768
01:06:58,563 --> 01:06:59,797
I'm the owner today?

1769
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:03,835
Calvin's shop, Bree speaking.

1770
01:07:03,902 --> 01:07:05,237
<i>May I speak to Calvin, please?</i>

1771
01:07:05,304 --> 01:07:07,139
Yeah, one second.
Calvin, it's for you.

1772
01:07:07,206 --> 01:07:08,673
Who is it?

1773
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:10,475
I'm sorry, may I ask
who's calling?

1774
01:07:10,542 --> 01:07:12,344
<i>It's me, girl!</i>

1775
01:07:12,411 --> 01:07:13,679
Why you acting all business like?

1776
01:07:13,746 --> 01:07:14,914
It's One-Stop.

1777
01:07:17,248 --> 01:07:18,717
I'll answer it in the back.

1778
01:07:20,319 --> 01:07:21,520
Yeah, he's gonna
take it in the back.

1779
01:07:21,585 --> 01:07:22,654
<i>It's like that?</i>

1780
01:07:22,721 --> 01:07:23,755
That's gross.

1781
01:07:29,161 --> 01:07:31,530
Yo, Raja, let me get
some of that spray, G.

1782
01:07:31,596 --> 01:07:33,330
I had to get mine in the back,
like everybody else,

1783
01:07:33,397 --> 01:07:35,433
so what makes you so special, "G"?

1784
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:37,302
<i>You a vic, man.
Say that to my face.</i>

1785
01:07:37,368 --> 01:07:39,104
<i>Come on back and say it
to my... Don't! No, don't.</i>

1786
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:40,638
No, no, stop being mean, Rashad.

1787
01:07:40,706 --> 01:07:42,374
<i>Stop!</i>

1788
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:44,042
Shit!

1789
01:07:44,109 --> 01:07:45,110
Shit! That's dope!

1790
01:07:45,177 --> 01:07:46,178
Yeah!

1791
01:07:46,244 --> 01:07:47,246
Yo, you...

1792
01:07:47,311 --> 01:07:48,547
You hooked it up!

1793
01:07:48,614 --> 01:07:50,949
One-Stop, why didn't you just
call me on my phone?

1794
01:07:51,016 --> 01:07:52,485
<i>B, your cell
number's in my old phone.</i>

1795
01:07:52,551 --> 01:07:54,018
<i>I got a new Galaxy.</i>

1796
01:07:54,085 --> 01:07:55,687
It isn't even out yet, man.
It's not even on the market.

1797
01:07:55,755 --> 01:07:56,956
People don't have it yet.

1798
01:07:57,022 --> 01:07:58,255
<i>Has everything on this bad boy...</i>

1799
01:07:58,322 --> 01:08:00,391
Satellite radio,
holographic video,

1800
01:08:00,458 --> 01:08:02,694
surround sound, 5G.

1801
01:08:02,761 --> 01:08:04,228
<i>Man, this phone is the only phone</i>

1802
01:08:04,295 --> 01:08:05,797
<i>that's, like, five minutes
ahead of every call.</i>

1803
01:08:05,864 --> 01:08:07,398
So, I already talked
to your ass already!

1804
01:08:07,465 --> 01:08:08,500
Dude, shut up!

1805
01:08:08,567 --> 01:08:09,568
<i>It's crazy!</i>

1806
01:08:09,634 --> 01:08:11,002
Damn. Now what's going on?

1807
01:08:11,069 --> 01:08:13,071
Look, I got a Italian couple
here that's hot on this place.

1808
01:08:13,139 --> 01:08:14,306
<i>- They love it!
- Who?</i>

1809
01:08:14,371 --> 01:08:16,074
They wanna open a yogurt spot
or a yoga spot.

1810
01:08:16,141 --> 01:08:18,043
What's the issue?
What'd you call me for?

1811
01:08:18,109 --> 01:08:19,378
Are we good or not?

1812
01:08:19,444 --> 01:08:20,645
<i>Because if you're
thinking about backing out...</i>

1813
01:08:20,712 --> 01:08:22,047
I'm not thinking about
backing out.

1814
01:08:22,112 --> 01:08:24,415
Now, I told you, me and
my wife, we want that shop.

1815
01:08:24,482 --> 01:08:27,351
<i>All right, man. Oui, oui.
I'll see you Monday.</i>

1816
01:08:27,419 --> 01:08:28,988
And that's French.

1817
01:08:30,289 --> 01:08:31,590
Dumbass.

1818
01:08:37,562 --> 01:08:38,597
Hey, what's up?

1819
01:08:39,263 --> 01:08:40,333
What's up?

1820
01:08:41,098 --> 01:08:42,301
You good?

1821
01:08:43,067 --> 01:08:44,337
I'm straight.

1822
01:08:55,981 --> 01:08:57,415
We rolling out
with the rest of the family

1823
01:08:57,481 --> 01:08:58,783
from Holy City tomorrow.

1824
01:09:00,151 --> 01:09:01,453
Y'all still down, right?

1825
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:02,989
<i>Hell, yeah. Yeah, probably.</i>

1826
01:09:09,428 --> 01:09:10,929
This nigga said probably?

1827
01:09:10,995 --> 01:09:12,530
No, we down for sure.

1828
01:09:17,302 --> 01:09:18,870
Y'all little niggas better be.

1829
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:20,873
Because if you in this,
you in this for life.

1830
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:23,875
But you know that,
though, right, Kenny?

1831
01:09:25,843 --> 01:09:27,012
Yeah, I know what's up.

1832
01:09:29,147 --> 01:09:30,348
Yeah, all right.

1833
01:09:31,215 --> 01:09:32,351
We gonna see.

1834
01:09:35,553 --> 01:09:37,922
I'm gonna give you the shake
tomorrow, too, youngster.

1835
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:39,225
That's right.

1836
01:09:47,865 --> 01:09:49,167
I'm not stalking you,

1837
01:09:49,235 --> 01:09:51,236
I'm just getting something
for my clients.

1838
01:09:51,303 --> 01:09:54,740
Draya, I want to
talk to you anyway, 'cause...

1839
01:09:54,807 --> 01:09:56,275
You know what? The other night...

1840
01:09:56,342 --> 01:09:57,942
That was my fault.

1841
01:09:58,009 --> 01:09:59,512
I was tripping.

1842
01:09:59,578 --> 01:10:01,914
And I hope we good.

1843
01:10:04,415 --> 01:10:06,151
I forgive you, Rashad.

1844
01:10:09,554 --> 01:10:11,690
Hey, who wants some chicken wings?

1845
01:10:11,757 --> 01:10:13,157
And I got some homemade
banana pudding

1846
01:10:13,225 --> 01:10:14,360
from BJ's Market.

1847
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:15,527
Nice!

1848
01:10:16,995 --> 01:10:18,664
Is this gluten-free, Terri?

1849
01:10:21,932 --> 01:10:23,134
Hey, what you doing now?

1850
01:10:23,201 --> 01:10:24,302
You're saying no,

1851
01:10:24,369 --> 01:10:25,838
but that's not what you mean,
Rashad.

1852
01:10:25,905 --> 01:10:27,438
That is what I mean.

1853
01:10:27,505 --> 01:10:28,706
I knew I wasn't tripping
the other night.

1854
01:10:28,773 --> 01:10:30,174
- No, you weren't.
- You tripping right now.

1855
01:10:30,241 --> 01:10:31,509
<i>Rashad!</i>

1856
01:10:34,547 --> 01:10:35,947
Shad, you back here?

1857
01:10:38,249 --> 01:10:39,350
Shad!

1858
01:10:42,187 --> 01:10:43,689
<i>Babe.</i>

1859
01:10:43,755 --> 01:10:45,456
Shad, you back here?

1860
01:10:45,523 --> 01:10:47,025
- You be quiet.
- You be quiet!

1861
01:10:47,092 --> 01:10:49,027
No, no!

1862
01:10:49,093 --> 01:10:50,562
<i>Where you at?</i>

1863
01:10:51,695 --> 01:10:53,130
Man.

1864
01:10:53,197 --> 01:10:54,732
Babe, you in the bathroom?

1865
01:11:19,124 --> 01:11:20,759
Hi, Terri.

1866
01:11:20,825 --> 01:11:22,761
No, baby. I'm tellin' you,
we did nothing.

1867
01:11:22,828 --> 01:11:24,163
- Get off me!
- There was nothing happening!

1868
01:11:24,228 --> 01:11:25,562
<i>Don't touch me!</i>

1869
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:26,897
- I need you to listen to me!
- Do not touch me!

1870
01:11:26,964 --> 01:11:29,435
I'm listening, I'll listen!
I'll listen! I'm listening.

1871
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:30,701
It ain't what you think...

1872
01:11:30,702 --> 01:11:31,902
Okay, all right!

1873
01:11:31,969 --> 01:11:33,838
Hey, what's going on?

1874
01:11:33,905 --> 01:11:36,174
<i>Draya, stop!
Calvin, help me on this!</i>

1875
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:37,575
Get off me!

1876
01:11:38,576 --> 01:11:39,578
Wait a minute!

1877
01:11:39,645 --> 01:11:40,645
Let me get at her!

1878
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:41,879
Get off me!

1879
01:11:41,945 --> 01:11:43,214
- Baby!
- Rashad, get off me!

1880
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:44,448
<i>Baby, you gotta chill.
Nothing happened.</i>

1881
01:11:44,516 --> 01:11:45,784
Calvin, help me!

1882
01:11:45,850 --> 01:11:47,084
World Star fight!

1883
01:11:47,151 --> 01:11:48,419
No, no World Star.

1884
01:11:48,486 --> 01:11:49,687
I need you
to listen to me for a second.

1885
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:50,788
Leave me alone!

1886
01:11:51,856 --> 01:11:53,258
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1887
01:11:54,926 --> 01:11:56,962
Calm down.
I need you to calm down.

1888
01:12:03,468 --> 01:12:04,970
You ain't even worth it.

1889
01:12:15,379 --> 01:12:16,514
Go get her.

1890
01:12:20,486 --> 01:12:21,520
<i>Cal,</i>

1891
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,422
<i>do we still have those cameras
in the back?</i>

1892
01:12:24,489 --> 01:12:26,225
I told you not to take those down.

1893
01:12:26,292 --> 01:12:28,826
We could've had the shop's
first sex tape.

1894
01:12:28,893 --> 01:12:30,428
<i>Whatever! Terri. Terri, come on.</i>

1895
01:12:30,495 --> 01:12:31,663
- I know what I saw.
- Come on, Terri.

1896
01:12:31,730 --> 01:12:32,931
- Hey, Terri, come on.
- I know what I saw.

1897
01:12:32,998 --> 01:12:34,331
- I need you to talk to me.
- I knew it!

1898
01:12:34,398 --> 01:12:35,601
- Whatever! I knew it.
- You have to listen to me.

1899
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,436
I knew it. I should've
never trusted you

1900
01:12:37,502 --> 01:12:38,704
or that skank ass ho!

1901
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,505
Look, why would I mess around
with Draya

1902
01:12:40,571 --> 01:12:41,839
in the same shop you work at?

1903
01:12:41,905 --> 01:12:43,074
- I'm smarter than that!
- Whatever!

1904
01:12:43,141 --> 01:12:44,276
I don't care what happened!

1905
01:12:44,342 --> 01:12:45,777
You should've never
let it get that far.

1906
01:12:45,843 --> 01:12:47,512
You made her think she could!

1907
01:12:47,579 --> 01:12:49,447
Why do you even
talk to her anyway?

1908
01:12:49,514 --> 01:12:50,615
I don't know!

1909
01:12:50,682 --> 01:12:52,817
It's because...
Look, she talked to me.

1910
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:54,520
You don't be talking to me,
I talk!

1911
01:12:54,585 --> 01:12:56,687
She asked me how I'm doing,
she asked what's going on!

1912
01:12:56,754 --> 01:12:58,422
- Where you at?
- Where I'm at!

1913
01:12:58,490 --> 01:13:00,325
I'm working, for us,
for our family!

1914
01:13:00,392 --> 01:13:02,761
This ain't about work,
I'm talking about us.

1915
01:13:02,828 --> 01:13:04,329
Me and you.

1916
01:13:04,396 --> 01:13:06,264
I'm talking about me and you
for real. Look at me.

1917
01:13:08,999 --> 01:13:11,136
Baby, look, look.

1918
01:13:11,201 --> 01:13:13,672
I tell you, you look beautiful
every day.

1919
01:13:13,739 --> 01:13:15,374
I say that because I mean it,

1920
01:13:15,441 --> 01:13:17,443
and I want you to know
that I see it,

1921
01:13:17,508 --> 01:13:19,944
because I love you,
I care about you.

1922
01:13:20,012 --> 01:13:22,380
You sound like
a real bitch right now.

1923
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:25,616
Look, I ain't gonna be
too many bitches.

1924
01:13:25,683 --> 01:13:26,685
Straight up.

1925
01:13:27,919 --> 01:13:29,721
Now, if you wanna have
a real conversation,

1926
01:13:29,788 --> 01:13:31,356
we have a real conversation.

1927
01:13:32,923 --> 01:13:35,226
But you ain't gonna never
call me a bitch again.

1928
01:13:37,728 --> 01:13:39,731
I don't have nothing else
to say to you.

1929
01:13:44,035 --> 01:13:45,204
I'm out.

1930
01:13:49,039 --> 01:13:50,074
Go on then.

1931
01:13:53,911 --> 01:13:55,146
Damn.

1932
01:13:55,213 --> 01:13:56,981
For all that,
I should have smashed.

1933
01:14:02,588 --> 01:14:03,989
<i>Good afternoon, everybody!</i>

1934
01:14:04,054 --> 01:14:06,424
<i>Folks coming home from church
are getting ready</i>

1935
01:14:06,490 --> 01:14:08,092
<i>for their Sunday dinner.</i>

1936
01:14:08,159 --> 01:14:09,928
<i>It's a lazy quiet day...</i>

1937
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:11,029
<i>It's your girl, Terri. Leave it.</i>

1938
01:14:11,096 --> 01:14:12,263
<i>And that's a good thing for once.</i>

1939
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:13,497
<i>Stay with us, I got
some of your requests</i>

1940
01:14:13,565 --> 01:14:14,665
<i>coming up momentarily.</i>

1941
01:14:14,732 --> 01:14:16,067
<i>All right, I'm good. Thank you!</i>

1942
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:31,782
You got something you wanna say?

1943
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:33,250
You know what,
women like you are the reason

1944
01:14:33,317 --> 01:14:35,387
why women like me
can't find a decent man.

1945
01:14:35,454 --> 01:14:36,721
Excuse me?

1946
01:14:36,788 --> 01:14:37,856
Bree, this is not the time...

1947
01:14:37,923 --> 01:14:39,291
Don't be mad at me
because you can't

1948
01:14:39,356 --> 01:14:41,125
- get a man or keep a man!
- Draya...

1949
01:14:41,191 --> 01:14:42,359
With all the single dudes
in the world,

1950
01:14:42,427 --> 01:14:43,629
you just gotta be
a married man's ho?

1951
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:44,829
Is that your thing?
Is that what you do?

1952
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:45,929
Yo, you better get your girl.

1953
01:14:45,996 --> 01:14:46,964
You just break up
a healthy relationship?

1954
01:14:47,031 --> 01:14:48,165
You gotta get your girl.

1955
01:14:48,232 --> 01:14:49,433
- You better get her now!
- Ladies! Ladies, listen.

1956
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:50,634
<i>I'm dead serious.</i>

1957
01:14:50,701 --> 01:14:51,869
<i>Don't nobody wanna hear all that!</i>

1958
01:14:51,937 --> 01:14:53,204
Now, if y'all wanna
fight, fuss and cuss,

1959
01:14:53,271 --> 01:14:54,639
you take it to the back.

1960
01:14:54,706 --> 01:14:56,407
<i>Cal, this is not Fight Club.</i>

1961
01:14:56,475 --> 01:14:58,243
You can't send ladies
to the back room to fight.

1962
01:14:58,310 --> 01:15:00,946
You gotta sign a waiver
and a release of liability.

1963
01:15:01,012 --> 01:15:03,080
If they start fighting in that
back room and tear shit up,

1964
01:15:03,147 --> 01:15:04,382
<i>I'm telling you, man,</i>

1965
01:15:04,449 --> 01:15:05,316
<i>it's gonna come back
on your insurance.</i>

1966
01:15:05,383 --> 01:15:06,618
<i>That's a deductible.</i>

1967
01:15:06,685 --> 01:15:08,553
And I do dental work, too,
if it gets out of hand.

1968
01:15:08,620 --> 01:15:09,721
<i>Okay, come see me.</i>

1969
01:15:09,788 --> 01:15:11,089
Man, shut up, One-Stop.

1970
01:15:11,155 --> 01:15:13,424
Look, I don't wanna
take sides here,

1971
01:15:13,491 --> 01:15:15,659
but does anybody else here
see the hypocrisy

1972
01:15:15,727 --> 01:15:18,663
in always blaming the single
woman for the affair?

1973
01:15:18,730 --> 01:15:21,100
<i>I mean, let's be honest,
she wasn't the one</i>

1974
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:23,802
who swore to be honest
and to be faithful

1975
01:15:23,869 --> 01:15:26,972
<i>and not cheat in the back room
of the barbershop</i>

1976
01:15:27,039 --> 01:15:28,973
until I'm dead. It was him.

1977
01:15:29,039 --> 01:15:31,808
How many times I gotta say
ain't nothing happened?

1978
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:33,277
Yeah, nothing happened.

1979
01:15:33,344 --> 01:15:34,945
But I'm not gonna spend every day

1980
01:15:35,012 --> 01:15:38,649
explaining myself
to you, you, or you!

1981
01:15:40,151 --> 01:15:42,520
Look, I'm just saying,
hypothetically, okay?

1982
01:15:42,587 --> 01:15:45,590
It is shameful society always
blames the other woman

1983
01:15:45,656 --> 01:15:47,191
when they should be blaming him.

1984
01:15:47,258 --> 01:15:48,493
<i>Listen, doofus...</i>

1985
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,928
Monogamy doesn't run in our DNA.

1986
01:15:50,995 --> 01:15:52,697
- You understand that?
- What?

1987
01:15:52,763 --> 01:15:53,965
You can't defy science.

1988
01:15:54,031 --> 01:15:55,766
That is ridiculous,
that is bullshit.

1989
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:57,435
<i>Women want sex, too.</i>

1990
01:15:57,502 --> 01:15:59,538
And you don't see us
lying and cheating,

1991
01:15:59,605 --> 01:16:01,172
and going out buying sports cars.

1992
01:16:01,239 --> 01:16:03,174
You're just a weak-ass man, Dante.

1993
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:04,676
Honestly, it's as simple as that.

1994
01:16:04,741 --> 01:16:06,043
Yeah, okay and I'll be that.

1995
01:16:06,110 --> 01:16:07,679
A weak-ass man with a sports car

1996
01:16:07,745 --> 01:16:09,913
and a gaggle of bitches.

1997
01:16:09,981 --> 01:16:11,383
In real life.

1998
01:16:11,450 --> 01:16:13,418
Y'all ain't shit, man.

1999
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,219
Hey, hey, hey, now, wait a minute.

2000
01:16:15,286 --> 01:16:17,187
Don't lump us all in there.

2001
01:16:17,254 --> 01:16:19,156
You know, men aren't
just looking to cheat.

2002
01:16:19,223 --> 01:16:22,326
That's like saying every woman
wants a big package.

2003
01:16:22,392 --> 01:16:23,994
<i>Because it's just not true.</i>

2004
01:16:24,062 --> 01:16:26,198
They do, they all
want a big package.

2005
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:28,065
I know I do.

2006
01:16:28,133 --> 01:16:29,668
Honestly, I thought
that it was more about

2007
01:16:29,734 --> 01:16:32,503
passion and love, and, like,
how you guys connected...

2008
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:33,772
<i>I mean, I have...</i>

2009
01:16:33,838 --> 01:16:35,672
I believe he's gay.

2010
01:16:35,740 --> 01:16:37,909
Like that? Like that?

2011
01:16:37,975 --> 01:16:39,209
<i>I'm a real man.</i>

2012
01:16:39,276 --> 01:16:40,712
I don't feel like I need to cheat.

2013
01:16:40,777 --> 01:16:42,413
Now that's just a lie.

2014
01:16:42,480 --> 01:16:44,214
<i>Because if Halle Berry came
walking in right now</i>

2015
01:16:44,281 --> 01:16:45,749
and offered you them drawers,

2016
01:16:45,816 --> 01:16:46,917
you trying to tell me you wouldn't

2017
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:48,585
take her in the back
and just bed her down?

2018
01:16:48,652 --> 01:16:51,056
Hell, no. Halle Berry
crazy as hell.

2019
01:16:51,123 --> 01:16:53,125
<i>From Monster's Ball?</i>

2020
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:54,892
"I want you to just

2021
01:16:54,959 --> 01:16:57,094
"make me feel good."

2022
01:16:57,161 --> 01:16:58,529
No.

2023
01:16:58,596 --> 01:16:59,964
You crazier than she is.

2024
01:17:00,932 --> 01:17:02,266
I like them crazy.

2025
01:17:02,333 --> 01:17:04,067
Like one-eye open crazy.

2026
01:17:04,134 --> 01:17:06,204
Like gotta hide your wallet crazy.

2027
01:17:06,271 --> 01:17:07,539
Solange crazy.

2028
01:17:07,606 --> 01:17:09,373
Kick me, bitch, in the elevator.

2029
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:11,009
- Man, that's...
- Shut up!

2030
01:17:17,048 --> 01:17:19,317
I can't wait to give her this D.

2031
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:21,819
He crazy there. This one.

2032
01:17:21,886 --> 01:17:23,187
Now that's dangerous.

2033
01:17:23,254 --> 01:17:24,788
<i>Well, look, maybe it's just me.</i>

2034
01:17:24,856 --> 01:17:26,324
I'm a romantic.

2035
01:17:26,391 --> 01:17:27,759
One woman is good enough for me.

2036
01:17:27,825 --> 01:17:29,026
<i>Yeah, what's going on, everybody?</i>

2037
01:17:29,093 --> 01:17:30,594
<i>I wanna send a special shout-out</i>

2038
01:17:30,661 --> 01:17:31,896
<i>to Calvin's Barbershop
over on the South Side.</i>

2039
01:17:31,963 --> 01:17:33,498
Hey!

2040
01:17:33,563 --> 01:17:34,965
<i>They're right in the midst
of a 48-hour ceasefire</i>

2041
01:17:35,031 --> 01:17:36,967
<i>to increase the peace. Doing it.</i>

2042
01:17:37,035 --> 01:17:38,203
<i>Keep it going, y'all.</i>

2043
01:17:38,268 --> 01:17:39,337
<i>Hey, did y'all hear that?</i>

2044
01:17:39,404 --> 01:17:40,672
Did y'all hear my name
on the radio?

2045
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:42,339
<i>It's all right. Did you hear that?</i>

2046
01:17:42,406 --> 01:17:43,807
All right, that's dope,
but it's still not

2047
01:17:43,874 --> 01:17:45,476
a trending topic on Twitter, okay?

2048
01:17:45,543 --> 01:17:46,978
Don't matter.

2049
01:17:47,044 --> 01:17:48,079
Because this is my shit.

2050
01:17:49,181 --> 01:17:50,581
What the hell are you doing?

2051
01:17:50,648 --> 01:17:52,017
I'm dancing,

2052
01:17:52,083 --> 01:17:53,518
in a non-gay way.

2053
01:17:58,690 --> 01:17:59,757
Turn that up!

2054
01:18:07,231 --> 01:18:08,866
Bring it on, Eddie! Bring it on.

2055
01:18:11,835 --> 01:18:13,539
<i>Come on, girl!</i>

2056
01:18:20,245 --> 01:18:21,813
Go, Calvin!

2057
01:18:57,715 --> 01:18:59,484
Rashad, baby!

2058
01:19:20,237 --> 01:19:21,405
Hey, what's up, Terrence?

2059
01:19:21,472 --> 01:19:22,840
Did you come to get a cut, man,

2060
01:19:22,906 --> 01:19:24,942
or are you here
to see Eddie twerk?

2061
01:19:25,009 --> 01:19:26,677
- No, no, no, no!
- You don't talk!

2062
01:19:26,745 --> 01:19:27,912
Come on, Eddie! Show him!

2063
01:19:27,978 --> 01:19:29,079
You know I do no twerking!

2064
01:19:31,148 --> 01:19:32,851
<i>Eddie, come on, you can twerk.</i>

2065
01:19:34,419 --> 01:19:36,188
Look, listen, guys...

2066
01:19:38,589 --> 01:19:40,458
There was a shooting
on 26th and King

2067
01:19:40,525 --> 01:19:42,259
<i>- just a few minutes ago.
- Man! Really?</i>

2068
01:19:43,661 --> 01:19:44,812
It was Anthony Clark.

2069
01:19:46,030 --> 01:19:47,964
- What?
- Wait, our Anthony?

2070
01:19:48,031 --> 01:19:49,601
<i>God.</i>

2071
01:19:55,706 --> 01:19:57,075
What happened?

2072
01:19:57,141 --> 01:19:58,610
He was walking home
from the library.

2073
01:19:58,677 --> 01:19:59,911
<i>He died on the scene.</i>

2074
01:19:59,977 --> 01:20:01,979
There was nothing
any of us could do.

2075
01:20:03,981 --> 01:20:05,383
God.

2076
01:20:07,151 --> 01:20:08,553
Calvin...

2077
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:11,222
<i>I didn't come here to bring
anybody down, okay?</i>

2078
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:13,525
I'm really proud of the work
you guys are doing here.

2079
01:20:13,592 --> 01:20:15,058
<i>I mean, all the progress
you've made with the shop...</i>

2080
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,527
Progress?

2081
01:20:17,361 --> 01:20:19,931
What progress, man?

2082
01:20:19,998 --> 01:20:21,933
I mean, what are
you talking about?

2083
01:20:24,503 --> 01:20:25,969
A kid just died.

2084
01:20:26,036 --> 01:20:27,771
A mother's child...

2085
01:20:27,838 --> 01:20:30,107
A father's child is dead.

2086
01:20:30,173 --> 01:20:31,475
One of the best ones we got.

2087
01:20:31,543 --> 01:20:32,777
Yeah.

2088
01:20:33,945 --> 01:20:35,781
That ain't no progress.

2089
01:20:36,514 --> 01:20:38,049
That's failure!

2090
01:20:39,316 --> 01:20:41,819
Nothing we've done has worked.

2091
01:20:41,887 --> 01:20:44,155
We just wasting our time.

2092
01:20:44,222 --> 01:20:46,257
These kids ain't
gonna listen to us.

2093
01:20:46,324 --> 01:20:48,793
These kids, they like
to kill each other.

2094
01:20:48,859 --> 01:20:50,328
<i>They like that shit.</i>

2095
01:20:50,395 --> 01:20:52,230
<i>We crazy to think that</i>

2096
01:20:52,297 --> 01:20:54,499
haircuts can stop bullets.

2097
01:20:54,566 --> 01:20:57,101
Man, this is the fucking
South Side.

2098
01:20:57,168 --> 01:20:59,938
This ceasefire shit
is over. It's over.

2099
01:21:00,004 --> 01:21:01,339
Calvin, come on, now.

2100
01:21:01,405 --> 01:21:02,974
It's over, man!

2101
01:21:03,040 --> 01:21:04,476
Calvin.

2102
01:21:04,542 --> 01:21:06,444
Calvin, we made a commitment
to see this thing through.

2103
01:21:06,511 --> 01:21:08,346
I don't give a damn
about no commitment!

2104
01:21:08,413 --> 01:21:09,847
What commitment?

2105
01:21:11,148 --> 01:21:12,750
The commitment of them
killing each other?

2106
01:21:14,218 --> 01:21:16,320
They ain't got
no commitment to us!

2107
01:21:16,387 --> 01:21:18,956
Look, I feel terrible about
what happened to Anthony.

2108
01:21:19,022 --> 01:21:20,157
We all do.

2109
01:21:20,225 --> 01:21:22,526
That's the reason that
we have to keep going

2110
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:23,762
now more than ever.

2111
01:21:25,195 --> 01:21:26,763
How can you give up like this?

2112
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:28,199
Because that's what he do.

2113
01:21:29,566 --> 01:21:30,935
He already had planned to

2114
01:21:31,002 --> 01:21:33,004
open up a shop on the North Side.

2115
01:21:33,070 --> 01:21:34,371
That's what he put money down on.

2116
01:21:37,674 --> 01:21:39,377
Is that right, Cal?

2117
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:41,346
<i>You already plan
to leave us behind.</i>

2118
01:21:43,114 --> 01:21:44,348
Calvin.

2119
01:21:47,785 --> 01:21:49,221
Calvin, is that true?

2120
01:21:50,021 --> 01:21:51,623
Look.

2121
01:21:53,090 --> 01:21:54,292
I'm a father first.

2122
01:21:54,357 --> 01:21:55,592
My God.

2123
01:21:55,660 --> 01:21:57,528
You all gotta realize that. Okay?

2124
01:21:57,594 --> 01:21:58,829
I got a son too, man.

2125
01:21:58,896 --> 01:22:01,666
Okay, you take care of yours,
I take care of mine.

2126
01:22:01,732 --> 01:22:03,734
Now y'all depend on me
to do a few things,

2127
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:05,971
but Jalen depends on me
to do everything.

2128
01:22:06,036 --> 01:22:08,039
And I'm not about
to leave him out here

2129
01:22:08,106 --> 01:22:10,206
in these streets
to get hurt for you, you,

2130
01:22:10,273 --> 01:22:11,508
or this damn shop!

2131
01:22:11,575 --> 01:22:14,145
None of us have ever asked you
not to be a father!

2132
01:22:14,212 --> 01:22:15,812
None of us!

2133
01:22:15,879 --> 01:22:19,249
We are here because of fathers
like you and sons like Jalen,

2134
01:22:19,316 --> 01:22:21,418
and you didn't even tell us?

2135
01:22:21,486 --> 01:22:25,556
We get up every single day
and we work beside you!

2136
01:22:25,623 --> 01:22:27,259
We're supposed to be your friends!

2137
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:30,762
I am your partner!

2138
01:22:30,829 --> 01:22:32,364
<i>When were you gonna tell me?</i>

2139
01:22:32,429 --> 01:22:33,931
I was gonna say something
after the ceasefire.

2140
01:22:33,998 --> 01:22:36,000
- Man, that's bullshit.
- No, that's some real shit.

2141
01:22:36,066 --> 01:22:37,301
<i>You weren't gonna tell us</i>

2142
01:22:37,368 --> 01:22:38,436
'cause you ain't care
about what we think.

2143
01:22:38,503 --> 01:22:40,371
- What?
- You sold us out, man.

2144
01:22:40,437 --> 01:22:43,340
I didn't sell nobody out, man.
I've been here for years!

2145
01:22:43,406 --> 01:22:45,776
Y'all are the only reason
I come to this damn shop!

2146
01:22:45,843 --> 01:22:48,512
I've been wanting
to leave here years ago!

2147
01:22:48,579 --> 01:22:50,414
<i>I'm just trying to do better, man.</i>

2148
01:22:50,481 --> 01:22:52,917
That's it! For my family!

2149
01:22:52,984 --> 01:22:54,852
If you can't understand
that, I'm sorry.

2150
01:22:54,919 --> 01:22:56,020
I'm sorry, but I'm out!

2151
01:22:56,085 --> 01:22:57,088
Wait, Calvin. Come on.

2152
01:22:57,155 --> 01:22:58,523
- Let's talk...
- No. I'm gone. I'm out!

2153
01:22:58,588 --> 01:23:00,658
Calvin! Calvin?

2154
01:23:12,770 --> 01:23:14,705
Thanks. Appreciate it.

2155
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:31,722
What do you say, Eugene?

2156
01:23:31,789 --> 01:23:33,590
<i>Hey, hey, what's up, Big Eddie?</i>

2157
01:23:33,657 --> 01:23:35,427
Why don't you give me
a double shot of Hennessy?

2158
01:23:35,493 --> 01:23:36,994
You got it, boss.

2159
01:23:36,995 --> 01:23:38,495
Yep.

2160
01:23:38,562 --> 01:23:40,663
You got some of those wasabi nuts?

2161
01:23:44,969 --> 01:23:48,072
<i>Eddie, if you came in here
on some Ol' Man River shit,</i>

2162
01:23:48,138 --> 01:23:49,839
trying to tell me
what kind of fool I am

2163
01:23:49,906 --> 01:23:51,342
for moving the shop,

2164
01:23:51,409 --> 01:23:52,811
I don't want to hear it.

2165
01:23:52,877 --> 01:23:56,147
Well, I might as well just
take my drink to go then.

2166
01:23:56,213 --> 01:23:58,850
Go on. Put that in a plastic cup.

2167
01:24:00,718 --> 01:24:02,854
I'm gonna be real with you, Cal.

2168
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:05,590
I came in here to say,

2169
01:24:05,656 --> 01:24:07,859
thank you.

2170
01:24:07,924 --> 01:24:11,128
Now, I ain't want to say
this in front of everybody,

2171
01:24:11,195 --> 01:24:12,563
but you right.

2172
01:24:12,630 --> 01:24:15,834
Selling the shop is the best
thing for your family,

2173
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:18,469
and the perfect excuse
for me to get out.

2174
01:24:18,535 --> 01:24:19,770
Go on and retire.

2175
01:24:20,271 --> 01:24:22,540
Retire? You?

2176
01:24:23,907 --> 01:24:26,009
Thought you'd die before
you left that shop, Eddie.

2177
01:24:26,076 --> 01:24:27,311
Yeah.

2178
01:24:27,378 --> 01:24:31,449
I ain't dying in that old
raggedy-ass unisexual shop.

2179
01:24:31,516 --> 01:24:32,717
What...

2180
01:24:32,784 --> 01:24:34,986
I can't even recognize
that place no more.

2181
01:24:35,053 --> 01:24:36,387
Hell...

2182
01:24:36,454 --> 01:24:38,690
I don't even recognize
the neighborhood no more.

2183
01:24:38,755 --> 01:24:40,090
Yeah.

2184
01:24:41,124 --> 01:24:43,328
Got that right.

2185
01:24:43,393 --> 01:24:45,295
All the more reason

2186
01:24:45,362 --> 01:24:48,365
for you to just go on over
there to the North Side.

2187
01:24:56,473 --> 01:24:57,741
I know what you're doing, Eddie.

2188
01:24:58,808 --> 01:25:00,544
It's not easy, man.

2189
01:25:00,611 --> 01:25:03,114
Hell no, it ain't easy. Hell no.

2190
01:25:03,981 --> 01:25:06,316
We black. It's hard.

2191
01:25:06,383 --> 01:25:09,553
Hard and us go hand in hand.

2192
01:25:09,620 --> 01:25:11,688
But we ain't never gave up.

2193
01:25:11,754 --> 01:25:12,790
I didn't give up.

2194
01:25:13,557 --> 01:25:14,792
I gave out.

2195
01:25:15,727 --> 01:25:17,094
I'm tired, Eddie.

2196
01:25:18,562 --> 01:25:19,996
I'm tired, too.

2197
01:25:20,063 --> 01:25:22,032
We've been up 38 hours.

2198
01:25:31,976 --> 01:25:33,611
Anthony's gone.

2199
01:25:36,114 --> 01:25:38,514
And that hurts like hell.

2200
01:25:38,581 --> 01:25:41,018
But we done lost
a whole bunch more

2201
01:25:41,084 --> 01:25:43,920
if we didn't do that ceasefire.

2202
01:25:43,987 --> 01:25:45,623
Now we lost one.

2203
01:25:46,324 --> 01:25:48,460
He was special.

2204
01:25:48,526 --> 01:25:52,463
But we probably saved
more lives than we know.

2205
01:25:52,530 --> 01:25:56,334
And for that reason alone is
reason to keep up the fight.

2206
01:26:02,873 --> 01:26:04,609
- What's good, bro?
- Yo.

2207
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:07,611
I can't do this, man.

2208
01:26:07,678 --> 01:26:08,745
What?

2209
01:26:08,812 --> 01:26:10,080
I gotta walk away.

2210
01:26:10,146 --> 01:26:11,915
So you just gonna leave me
out here with Yummy alone?

2211
01:26:11,982 --> 01:26:14,051
I ain't leave you nowhere, man.

2212
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:15,620
You ain't got to do this either.

2213
01:26:15,687 --> 01:26:17,155
Can't believe
you doing this to me, yo.

2214
01:26:18,722 --> 01:26:19,890
What?

2215
01:26:19,956 --> 01:26:22,826
Look, my dad let me move
in with him and Terri.

2216
01:26:22,893 --> 01:26:24,061
They've been real cool to me.

2217
01:26:24,128 --> 01:26:25,429
I don't want to hear that, man.

2218
01:26:25,495 --> 01:26:27,263
J, what are you thinking?

2219
01:26:27,330 --> 01:26:28,965
I mean, look at
what you have here.

2220
01:26:29,032 --> 01:26:30,802
Everything you need is right here.

2221
01:26:30,868 --> 01:26:32,636
You got a moms, you got a dad.

2222
01:26:33,870 --> 01:26:34,938
I'm not doing this.

2223
01:26:35,005 --> 01:26:36,907
If you were smart,
you'd do the same.

2224
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:57,395
Do I need to check the closet?

2225
01:26:58,695 --> 01:27:00,264
You been gone all of this time

2226
01:27:00,330 --> 01:27:02,331
<i>and answered none of my messages</i>

2227
01:27:02,398 --> 01:27:04,201
and you come here playing.

2228
01:27:09,005 --> 01:27:10,441
I'm sorry.

2229
01:27:12,109 --> 01:27:13,244
I don't wanna fight.

2230
01:27:14,678 --> 01:27:18,850
With everything going on
right now, with Anthony,

2231
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:20,384
<i>we shouldn't be like this.</i>

2232
01:27:21,185 --> 01:27:22,352
I agree.

2233
01:27:25,522 --> 01:27:27,690
And I'm sorry
about that Draya mess.

2234
01:27:27,758 --> 01:27:29,794
Nothing happened.

2235
01:27:29,861 --> 01:27:31,396
But I shouldn't have
put you in that position.

2236
01:27:33,798 --> 01:27:35,300
I know nothing happened.

2237
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:37,502
You're just an idiot.

2238
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:41,572
I'm just a man, baby.

2239
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:44,476
I get it.

2240
01:27:45,776 --> 01:27:47,978
And I know
I've been working a lot.

2241
01:27:50,481 --> 01:27:52,617
But I need you to know...

2242
01:27:53,950 --> 01:27:56,120
That I see everything you do.

2243
01:27:57,154 --> 01:27:59,924
You're an amazing man, Rashad.

2244
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,826
You're an amazing father to Maya.

2245
01:28:02,893 --> 01:28:05,730
I could never ask for
a better partner than you.

2246
01:28:07,396 --> 01:28:09,299
I guess I just figured

2247
01:28:10,601 --> 01:28:12,902
you knew how I felt.

2248
01:28:12,969 --> 01:28:15,071
I do.

2249
01:28:15,138 --> 01:28:17,574
But sometimes a brotha
need to hear it.

2250
01:28:20,578 --> 01:28:22,379
One-Stop, can you sign this?

2251
01:28:22,445 --> 01:28:24,514
No doubt.

2252
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,018
<i>Thank you, baby.</i>

2253
01:28:28,084 --> 01:28:29,852
<i>This is crazy, man.</i>

2254
01:28:29,919 --> 01:28:31,922
<i>Bree, you wanna sign the card?</i>

2255
01:28:31,989 --> 01:28:33,691
<i>Yo, Jerrod, check it out.</i>

2256
01:28:35,993 --> 01:28:37,960
<i>Hey, what's up, everybody?</i>

2257
01:28:38,027 --> 01:28:40,130
Before y'all pack up
your stuff, can,

2258
01:28:40,197 --> 01:28:42,032
<i>can I talk to you for a minute?</i>

2259
01:28:45,969 --> 01:28:47,539
Just real quick.

2260
01:28:51,674 --> 01:28:54,311
Go on in now,
say what you gotta say.

2261
01:28:57,647 --> 01:28:59,016
I was wrong.

2262
01:29:01,185 --> 01:29:04,053
<i>The reason I wanted
to end the ceasefire</i>

2263
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:07,292
is the same reason why I wanted to
move the shop to the North Side.

2264
01:29:09,526 --> 01:29:11,128
Man, I was hurt.

2265
01:29:12,163 --> 01:29:13,531
Disappointed.

2266
01:29:15,732 --> 01:29:18,069
<i>But y'all know me.</i>

2267
01:29:18,136 --> 01:29:20,737
Y'all know I got love
for the South Side.

2268
01:29:23,374 --> 01:29:25,977
I got love for everybody
in this neighborhood.

2269
01:29:27,512 --> 01:29:30,615
I got love for everybody in here.

2270
01:29:30,682 --> 01:29:33,184
<i>All my customers,</i>

2271
01:29:33,249 --> 01:29:35,686
even the ones that don't know
how to go home.

2272
01:29:39,990 --> 01:29:40,992
What?

2273
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:43,527
Are y'all gonna play me like that?

2274
01:29:44,928 --> 01:29:47,031
So after a while, it just...

2275
01:29:47,097 --> 01:29:50,435
It just became easier
to just walk away.

2276
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,203
<i>Walk away from all this pain.</i>

2277
01:29:53,204 --> 01:29:54,706
All the hurt.

2278
01:29:56,906 --> 01:29:59,444
That ain't right either.

2279
01:29:59,509 --> 01:30:03,114
<i>If we don't do something for
this neighborhood, who will?</i>

2280
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:05,982
<i>At the end of the day
we can't expect people</i>

2281
01:30:06,049 --> 01:30:08,886
who don't know nothing about
what's going on around here,

2282
01:30:08,953 --> 01:30:11,723
to come in here
and solve our problems.

2283
01:30:13,758 --> 01:30:15,927
We gotta fix our problems ourself.

2284
01:30:17,727 --> 01:30:20,330
So what are you saying, Calvin?

2285
01:30:20,397 --> 01:30:23,066
I'm saying I wanna continue
what we started.

2286
01:30:23,133 --> 01:30:26,036
<i>I want to put the ceasefire
back on for the neighborhood.</i>

2287
01:30:26,102 --> 01:30:27,571
For Anthony...

2288
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:31,075
And really for us.

2289
01:30:31,141 --> 01:30:34,411
<i>But I'm only one half
of the leadership here, so,</i>

2290
01:30:34,477 --> 01:30:36,713
I'm gonna need the
support of my partner

2291
01:30:36,780 --> 01:30:39,716
before the ceasefire's
officially back on.

2292
01:30:39,784 --> 01:30:41,686
Calvin, you never lost my support.

2293
01:30:41,752 --> 01:30:43,187
You know, I'm here.

2294
01:30:43,254 --> 01:30:45,055
<i>I appreciate your
vote of confidence,</i>

2295
01:30:45,121 --> 01:30:46,590
but I think Angie
is the one you...

2296
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:48,090
You're good. You're good.

2297
01:30:48,157 --> 01:30:49,392
Angie is the one
you're speaking to.

2298
01:30:49,459 --> 01:30:50,895
Now you got it.

2299
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,396
<i>I totally misread the situation.</i>

2300
01:30:52,463 --> 01:30:53,563
<i>It's okay.</i>

2301
01:30:54,463 --> 01:30:56,066
So what you say, Ange?

2302
01:30:57,334 --> 01:30:58,503
Look...

2303
01:31:02,338 --> 01:31:03,407
<i>I just...</i>

2304
01:31:04,976 --> 01:31:06,410
I just can't understand why people

2305
01:31:06,477 --> 01:31:08,079
are still standing around

2306
01:31:08,145 --> 01:31:10,614
when my partner just said
the ceasefire is back on.

2307
01:31:10,681 --> 01:31:12,517
Yes!

2308
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,518
<i>Bait and switch.</i>

2309
01:31:15,585 --> 01:31:18,088
Thank you so much.

2310
01:31:18,155 --> 01:31:19,723
<i>All right. Let's do this.</i>

2311
01:31:19,789 --> 01:31:20,990
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

2312
01:31:21,057 --> 01:31:24,027
<i>That's good stuff right there.
Yes, sir. Good stuff.</i>

2313
01:31:24,094 --> 01:31:25,463
- Sorry about that.
- Nah.

2314
01:31:25,529 --> 01:31:27,697
<i>Let's celebrate!</i>

2315
01:31:27,763 --> 01:31:29,534
Yo. Can a brotha
get a cut around here?

2316
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:31,567
Damn!

2317
01:31:31,634 --> 01:31:33,070
Hey, D, what's up, man?

2318
01:31:33,136 --> 01:31:34,237
<i>How you doing?</i>

2319
01:31:34,303 --> 01:31:35,438
<i>Doing good now.</i>

2320
01:31:35,505 --> 01:31:36,539
I'm Calvin. This is my shop, man.

2321
01:31:36,606 --> 01:31:37,640
What can we do for you?

2322
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:39,076
Playing the Bulls tomorrow

2323
01:31:39,142 --> 01:31:40,911
and got a tweet from somebody
named thottiepimpin

2324
01:31:40,977 --> 01:31:42,879
about what y'all are doing
here and everything

2325
01:31:42,946 --> 01:31:44,047
and just came here
to show my support, man.

2326
01:31:44,115 --> 01:31:45,148
Cool.

2327
01:31:45,215 --> 01:31:46,484
Who's thottiepimpin?

2328
01:31:46,549 --> 01:31:47,784
That one right there.

2329
01:31:47,851 --> 01:31:49,053
What's up, man?

2330
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,755
- How you doing, man?
- I'm doing.

2331
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,789
- Just a second.
- You all right?

2332
01:31:52,856 --> 01:31:54,291
You okay?

2333
01:31:54,357 --> 01:31:56,293
Sorry, A.D. Sorry.
He's got issues.

2334
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:57,628
This was a mercy hire.

2335
01:31:57,695 --> 01:31:59,130
Just give the man some space.

2336
01:31:59,196 --> 01:32:01,097
- Hey. How ya doing?
- What's up, man?

2337
01:32:01,164 --> 01:32:02,331
- Good to see you.
- You too, man.

2338
01:32:02,398 --> 01:32:03,467
All right, bro. Keep growing.

2339
01:32:03,534 --> 01:32:05,069
High five.

2340
01:32:05,136 --> 01:32:06,736
Okay, come on, young man.

2341
01:32:06,803 --> 01:32:08,471
Sit on down. Come on in here.

2342
01:32:08,539 --> 01:32:10,775
Let me line that unibrow a little.

2343
01:32:10,842 --> 01:32:12,042
Give it a soft fade,

2344
01:32:12,109 --> 01:32:13,442
and then I'll cut

01:38:38,328 --> 01:38:41,499
maybe afford to own one less
pastel-colored t-shirt

2500
01:38:41,565 --> 01:38:43,100
and go up a size
in the jean department?

2501
01:38:43,165 --> 01:38:44,767
Yes, absolutely.

2502
01:38:44,834 --> 01:38:46,369
But who cares?

2503
01:38:46,437 --> 01:38:48,405
Clothes don't signify
someone's sexuality.

2504
01:38:48,472 --> 01:38:50,040
Even if you were gay...

2505
01:38:50,106 --> 01:38:51,675
I'm not. For the record.

2506
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:52,942
I'm not.

2507
01:38:53,009 --> 01:38:55,111
It wouldn't matter to me anyway.

2508
01:38:55,178 --> 01:38:56,881
I like who you are
and you shouldn't feel

2509
01:38:56,946 --> 01:38:58,447
pressured to change for anybody.

2510
01:38:58,514 --> 01:39:00,584
And there's no rules on
how to be a straight dude.

2511
01:39:00,651 --> 01:39:01,785
Look at Miguel.

2512
01:39:01,852 --> 01:39:03,020
Look at Prince.

2513
01:39:03,087 --> 01:39:05,623
Homeboy be rocking six-inch
stilettos and a perm,

2514
01:39:05,688 --> 01:39:06,757
and he can still get it.

2515
01:39:06,824 --> 01:39:08,959
Yes, he can.

2516
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:10,960
I'm messing with you.
Playing the whole...

2517
01:39:11,026 --> 01:39:12,096
- That's...
- Anyway.

2518
01:39:13,629 --> 01:39:15,532
So, you like my personality?

2519
01:39:16,933 --> 01:39:20,369
What can I say? I find
your neuroses entertaining.

2520
01:39:20,437 --> 01:39:23,940
Your passion for
women's rights liberating.

2521
01:39:24,007 --> 01:39:25,009
And...

2522
01:39:27,177 --> 01:39:29,146
I find your nerdiness

2523
01:39:29,212 --> 01:39:30,981
incredibly sexy.

2524
01:39:36,052 --> 01:39:37,053
Talking to me?

2525
01:39:38,120 --> 01:39:39,755
And that's why I like you.

2526
01:39:39,822 --> 01:39:41,292
Because you get me.

2527
01:39:41,357 --> 01:39:44,060
Not a lot of people do,
but you definitely do.

2528
01:39:44,127 --> 01:39:46,629
And just so you know,
Ronnie, your ex,

2529
01:39:46,695 --> 01:39:49,199
he was never good enough for you.

2530
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:02,679
I think I'm in love with you.

2531
01:40:02,745 --> 01:40:05,581
And I want to shout it
from the rooftops.

2532
01:40:05,648 --> 01:40:07,517
- Too soon?
- Yeah.

2533
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:09,519
- That's what I thought.
- Yeah.

2534
01:40:09,585 --> 01:40:11,754
I mean... What'd you hear?
You heard that I said

2535
01:40:11,821 --> 01:40:13,790
- I was in love with you?
- No.

2536
01:40:13,856 --> 01:40:14,924
Rewind that.

2537
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:16,092
How about dinner tomorrow night?

2538
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:17,261
- Okay.
- That makes sense.

2539
01:40:17,328 --> 01:40:18,895
Yeah. That's...

2540
01:40:18,962 --> 01:40:20,230
I went from a broken home...

2541
01:40:20,297 --> 01:40:21,298
so I give affection very fast.

2542
01:40:21,365 --> 01:40:22,532
My Lord. My Lord.

2543
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,334
Yeah. Yeah.

2544
01:40:26,236 --> 01:40:28,305
You got a lot of nerve
showing up here.

2545
01:40:28,371 --> 01:40:29,539
I came to apologize, Terri.

2546
01:40:29,606 --> 01:40:30,807
I don't want to hear it.

2547
01:40:30,874 --> 01:40:32,509
Well, I wanna say it anyway.

2548
01:40:36,079 --> 01:40:38,315
Listen, I'm really sorry.

2549
01:40:38,382 --> 01:40:40,284
I should have never come
between you and Rashad.

2550
01:40:40,350 --> 01:40:41,918
Damn right.

2551
01:40:41,985 --> 01:40:44,521
It's just that you have your
whole life taken care of,

2552
01:40:44,588 --> 01:40:46,657
and figured out. And...

2553
01:40:46,722 --> 01:40:48,290
I'm like, still
trying to figure out

2554
01:40:48,357 --> 01:40:49,459
every little thing about mine.

2555
01:40:51,093 --> 01:40:52,895
I made a mistake.

2556
01:40:52,962 --> 01:40:54,498
It'll never, ever happen again.

2557
01:40:54,563 --> 01:40:55,598
I promise you that.

2558
01:40:56,865 --> 01:40:58,101
Well...

2559
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,036
I appreciate you saying that.

2560
01:41:01,103 --> 01:41:03,206
Does that mean we're cool?

2561
01:41:05,141 --> 01:41:06,310
I guess.

2562
01:41:06,377 --> 01:41:07,410
Come here, girl!

2563
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:12,414
Anyway...

2564
01:41:12,481 --> 01:41:15,051
I did want to tell you
that if you and Rashad

2565
01:41:15,118 --> 01:41:17,487
was looking for, like,
a third girl to help you out,

2566
01:41:17,553 --> 01:41:19,556
you know, get it poppin'
or anything like that,

2567
01:41:19,623 --> 01:41:20,991
I would be down for that.

2568
01:41:21,057 --> 01:41:22,558
Mull it over.

2569
01:41:22,624 --> 01:41:23,659
- Bye, Draya.
- Hey, hey.

2570
01:41:23,726 --> 01:41:24,928
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

2571
01:41:24,994 --> 01:41:26,763
We need to at least
hear her out now.

2572
01:41:26,829 --> 01:41:28,665
I mean, she ain't
come this way for nothing.

2573
01:41:28,731 --> 01:41:30,333
Hey, Rashad! What's good, Draya?

2574
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:31,835
Get in the house. Baby.

2575
01:41:31,901 --> 01:41:33,370
<i>You think it's funny.
You're not funny.</i>

2576
01:41:33,437 --> 01:41:34,822
Thanks.

2577
01:41:36,272 --> 01:41:39,241
This is not what you think it is.

2578
01:41:39,308 --> 01:41:41,177
This is that bird
I talked about. Remember that?

2579
01:41:41,244 --> 01:41:42,246
It went away.

2580
01:41:43,812 --> 01:41:46,282
It flew away. Let 'em fly.

2581
01:41:51,420 --> 01:41:52,688
Know why I came back?

2582
01:41:52,755 --> 01:41:53,806
Why?

2583
01:41:53,807 --> 01:41:54,857
Because you my man.

2584
01:41:54,923 --> 01:41:56,225
I came back to you.

2585
01:41:56,293 --> 01:41:57,860
Why don't you just
give me the damn check?

2586
01:41:57,927 --> 01:41:59,128
My man.

2587
01:41:59,195 --> 01:42:00,364
That's your section.

2588
01:42:00,429 --> 01:42:02,065
- No booth rent.
- We're clear?

2589
01:42:02,132 --> 01:42:03,366
Do you.

2590
01:42:03,432 --> 01:42:04,801
My man. It's a pleasure,
my brotha.

2591
01:42:04,868 --> 01:42:06,535
<i>You will do
good business, my brotha.</i>

2592
01:42:06,602 --> 01:42:07,904
You have a good day!

2593
01:42:07,971 --> 01:42:09,973
Hit these streets. Hey! Hey!

2594
01:42:10,039 --> 01:42:11,374
I need to talk to you.
You got to sign

2595
01:42:11,441 --> 01:42:12,876
some paperwork, brotha.

2596
01:42:12,941 --> 01:42:14,610
<i>Your wife trying to find you.</i>

2597
01:42:14,678 --> 01:42:16,747
<i>You're gonna run from me, really?</i>

2598
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:21,484
Yo, man, we closed.

2599
01:42:21,551 --> 01:42:22,785
Come back tomorrow.

2600
01:42:22,852 --> 01:42:24,355
Man, that's too bad.

2601
01:42:27,156 --> 01:42:29,226
I was really hoping
you could fit me in.

2602
01:42:31,194 --> 01:42:33,295
I think I got room for one more.

2603
01:42:38,502 --> 01:42:40,004
Have a seat.

2604
01:42:45,042 --> 01:42:46,159
Glad you came, man.

2605
01:42:47,343 --> 01:42:48,845
Just wanted to
do something about this

2606
01:42:48,911 --> 01:42:50,646
so-called abomination you say.

2607
01:42:51,914 --> 01:42:53,917
I'll hook you up,
don't worry about nothin'.

2608
01:42:53,984 --> 01:42:56,486
Edge you up real quick.

2609
01:42:56,552 --> 01:42:59,022
I was thinking,

2610
01:42:59,088 --> 01:43:00,523
start off fresh.

2611
01:43:05,995 --> 01:43:07,064
You sure?

2612
01:43:08,330 --> 01:43:09,333
Positive.

2613
01:43:11,234 --> 01:43:12,302
All right.

2614
01:43:12,369 --> 01:43:13,670
Start you off fresh.

2615
01:43:14,937 --> 01:43:18,007
You know, I didn't mean
what I said earlier.

2616
01:43:18,074 --> 01:43:20,343
You've always been there
for me for everything,

2617
01:43:20,410 --> 01:43:21,745
and I appreciate it.

2618
01:43:24,112 --> 01:43:25,182
Love you, Dad.

2619
01:43:26,215 --> 01:43:27,517
I love you too, man.

2620
01:43:28,218 --> 01:43:29,952
Always gonna be my guy.

2621
01:43:30,018 --> 01:43:31,120
I swear.

2622
01:43:32,755 --> 01:43:35,959
All right. Let's see how
we can hook you up here.

2623
01:43:36,959 --> 01:43:38,428
Yeah, okay.

2624
01:43:39,129 --> 01:43:40,697
Now, listen...

2625
01:43:40,762 --> 01:43:42,398
I hear about anything,

2626
01:43:42,464 --> 01:43:44,199
I'm snatching you right up
out of there, you hear me?

2627
01:43:44,267 --> 01:43:46,069
- Yeah, I hear you.
- I'm not playing.

2628
01:43:46,136 --> 01:43:48,004
Be up there quick fast in a hurry.

2629
01:43:48,070 --> 01:43:51,040
I escort you to the bathroom
and everything if I have to.

2630
01:43:54,142 --> 01:43:55,645
Crazy, Dad.

2631
01:43:55,712 --> 01:43:57,480
But I'm fine with that.

2632
01:43:57,547 --> 01:43:59,883
I'm just happy to stay here.
Happy to be home.

2633
01:44:01,752 --> 01:44:03,553
I'm happy you back.

2634
01:44:03,620 --> 01:44:05,389
See me hooping this year, right?

2635
01:44:05,455 --> 01:44:07,523
You got to penetrate more.
Too many jumpers.

2636
01:44:07,590 --> 01:44:09,026
But they go in though.

2637
01:44:09,092 --> 01:44:10,360
Not all
the time, they don't go in.

2638
01:44:10,426 --> 01:44:11,727
Man...

2639
01:44:13,329 --> 01:44:15,431
You don't wanna rock
your dreads like that, man?

2640
01:44:15,498 --> 01:44:17,000
Now if you end up on the Bulls,

2641
01:44:17,066 --> 01:44:18,334
your daddy got to go
everywhere with you.

2642
01:44:18,401 --> 01:44:20,003
I'm gonna be the team barber.

2643
01:44:20,803 --> 01:44:21,837
Damn, man.

2644
01:44:21,905 --> 01:44:23,505
All right. Tsk.

2645
01:44:23,572 --> 01:44:25,107
Slow down.

2646
01:44:25,174 --> 01:44:26,275
Hey.

2647
01:44:26,342 --> 01:44:28,111
You ain't comb your hair
in six months,

2648
01:44:28,178 --> 01:44:29,413
it's a little nappy down there.

2649
01:44:29,478 --> 01:44:31,114
All kind of cucabugs back here.

2650
01:44:31,181 --> 01:44:32,248
Beebees.

2651
01:44:32,315 --> 01:44:33,650
You gonna be all right.

2652
01:44:35,485 --> 01:44:37,621
Yeah. That's it.

2653
01:44:41,257 --> 01:44:42,526
Look fresh.

2654
01:44:44,093 --> 01:44:46,396
Now you look like my son again.

2655
01:44:46,463 --> 01:44:48,264
I'm getting all the shorties
at school now.

2656
01:44:49,132 --> 01:44:50,266
Yeah.

2657
01:44:50,333 --> 01:44:52,201
Now you can sweep up the hair.

2658
01:44:54,036 --> 01:44:55,638
<i>Dear Chicago,</i>

2659
01:44:55,704 --> 01:44:57,973
<i>I know I was hard on you before,</i>

2660
01:44:58,040 --> 01:44:59,574
<i>but here's the thing.</i>

2661
01:44:59,642 --> 01:45:00,643
<i>If there's one thing...</i>

2662
01:45:00,709 --> 01:45:02,244
<i>I know about you,</i>

2663
01:45:02,312 --> 01:45:05,248
<i>is that you know
how to bounce back.</i>

2664
01:45:05,315 --> 01:45:07,317
<i>And we salute Chicago's own</i>

2665
01:45:07,383 --> 01:45:09,285
<i>South Side Champs.</i>

2666
01:45:12,688 --> 01:45:13,822
Chicago, stand up.

2667
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:15,659
Chicago, stand up.

2668
01:45:15,725 --> 01:45:17,828
We want them
to believe in themselves.

2669
01:45:17,893 --> 01:45:20,128
<i>We want them to believe
in their community.</i>

2670
01:45:20,195 --> 01:45:22,431
<i>We want them to believe
that they have a future.</i>

2671
01:45:22,499 --> 01:45:23,666
We are college bound.

2672
01:45:23,732 --> 01:45:24,834
We are exceptional.

2673
01:45:24,901 --> 01:45:26,069
Not because we say it,

2674
01:45:26,134 --> 01:45:27,302
but because we work hard at it.

2675
01:45:27,370 --> 01:45:29,072
Hey! Congratulations, Miss Paxton.

2676
01:45:33,176 --> 01:45:35,645
<i>You've always
taken personal tragedy</i>

2677
01:45:35,712 --> 01:45:37,780
<i>and turned it into triumph.</i>

2678
01:45:37,847 --> 01:45:39,349
No, don't do it...

2679
01:45:39,415 --> 01:45:41,116
Give me that!

2680
01:45:41,183 --> 01:45:42,785
<i>Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no!</i>

2681
01:45:42,852 --> 01:45:44,520
Breaking down like LeBron!

2682
01:45:44,587 --> 01:45:46,123
Know that. Know that. Yeah.

2683
01:45:46,188 --> 01:45:47,690
<i>They ain't ready.</i>

2684
01:45:47,757 --> 01:45:48,857
<i>That's why
I'm not giving up on you.</i>

2685
01:45:48,924 --> 01:45:51,326
There we go. This what we running.

2686
01:45:51,393 --> 01:45:53,797
<i>Because you never gave up on me.</i>

2687
01:45:58,200 --> 01:45:59,935
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2688
01:46:00,003 --> 01:46:01,038
Who won? Who won?

2689
01:46:01,039 --> 01:46:02,072
Boom, every time.

2690
01:46:02,871 --> 01:46:04,007
Mr. Wilson!

2691
01:46:07,611 --> 01:46:10,146
<i>And I know whatever happens,</i>

2692
01:46:10,213 --> 01:46:11,781
<i>eventually,</i>

2693
01:46:11,847 --> 01:46:13,548
<i>Chicago,</i>

2694
01:46:13,615 --> 01:46:16,018
<i>you'll find your way back home.</i>

2695
01:46:16,084 --> 01:46:17,820
<i>You always do.</i>

2696
01:46:20,722 --> 01:46:21,757
What's up?

2697
01:46:25,629 --> 01:46:27,997
Yeah, who won?
What's the real story?

2698
01:46:28,063 --> 01:46:29,664
What's the real story?

2699
01:46:29,731 --> 01:46:31,133
Who won? Who won?

2700
01:46:32,602 --> 01:46:34,137
<i>Let's just stick
to cutting hair, right?</i>

2701
01:46:39,141 --> 01:46:41,377
<i>What can the people
of Chicago take away from this?</i>

2702
01:46:41,444 --> 01:46:43,245
It's a reminder
that the individual,

2703
01:46:43,312 --> 01:46:45,015
or, in this case, individuals,

2704
01:46:45,081 --> 01:46:46,548
can make a big difference.

2705
01:46:46,615 --> 01:46:48,183
<i>As a former barber in the shop,</i>

2706
01:46:48,250 --> 01:46:50,219
<i>- it's been very inspiring...
- Is that Jimmy James?</i>

2707
01:46:50,285 --> 01:46:51,554
<i>For me to see the people
of community</i>

2708
01:46:51,620 --> 01:46:52,721
<i>come together and show the world</i>

2709
01:46:52,789 --> 01:46:54,391
<i>that there's still hope
on the South Side.</i>

2710
01:46:54,456 --> 01:46:55,525
<i>Mr. James!</i>

2711
01:46:55,526 --> 01:46:56,593
<i>Ms. Cruz.</i>

2712
01:46:56,659 --> 01:46:58,361
<i>In light of the
success of the ceasefire,</i>

2713
01:46:58,428 --> 01:47:00,530
<i>have you personally changed
your mind about the enclosure,</i>

2714
01:47:00,597 --> 01:47:02,199
<i>and do you think
it'll have any effect</i>

2715
01:47:02,264 --> 01:47:03,566
<i>on the upcoming council vote?</i>

2716
01:47:03,633 --> 01:47:04,768
Go ahead, Jimmy.

2717
01:47:04,834 --> 01:47:06,203
<i>Well, I can't speak
for the Council,</i>

2718
01:47:06,268 --> 01:47:08,105
<i>but I'd be shocked
if they voted yes,</i>

2719
01:47:08,170 --> 01:47:09,739
<i>when so many have
voted against it.</i>

2720
01:47:09,806 --> 01:47:11,007
<i>See, the whole point
of the enclosure</i>

2721
01:47:11,074 --> 01:47:12,709
<i>was to decrease violence
in the neighborhood.</i>

2722
01:47:12,776 --> 01:47:14,511
<i>And I think that
Mr. Palmer and Ms. Norris...</i>

2723
01:47:16,045 --> 01:47:16,945
<i>and the rest of the team
down at the shop...</i>

2724
01:47:17,012 --> 01:47:18,581
<i>found a way to do just that.</i>

2725
01:47:18,647 --> 01:47:20,516
<i>That's right!</i>

2726
01:47:20,583 --> 01:47:21,584
<i>Yeah!</i>

2727
01:47:25,521 --> 01:47:27,323
Dad! You see this?

2728
01:47:29,325 --> 01:47:30,627
<i>Man, that's got to...
No, it ain't.</i>

2729
01:47:30,692 --> 01:47:31,895
Serious?

2730
01:47:31,962 --> 01:47:33,094
My God.

2731
01:47:33,161 --> 01:47:34,597
<i>My God.</i>

2732
01:47:34,664 --> 01:47:35,732
Hey, everybody!

2733
01:47:35,733 --> 01:47:36,800
Hell, no.

2734
01:47:36,866 --> 01:47:38,066
It's good to see you.

2735
01:47:38,133 --> 01:47:39,268
- How are you?
- Mr. President.

2736
01:47:39,335 --> 01:47:40,436
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

2737
01:47:40,503 --> 01:47:41,737
<i>I like that sharp suit.</i>

2738
01:47:41,803 --> 01:47:43,138
- Hey, I'll get you one.
- I'm gonna hold you to that.

2739
01:47:43,204 --> 01:47:44,239
<i>Gotcha. Okay.</i>

2740
01:47:44,307 --> 01:47:46,242
Mr. President, how you doing, sir?

2741
01:47:46,308 --> 01:47:47,576
You know, it's good to be back,

2742
01:47:47,643 --> 01:47:49,445
where it all started for me.

2743
01:47:49,512 --> 01:47:50,713
The South Side.

2744
01:47:50,780 --> 01:47:52,516
- I told you.
- Hey, Eddie!

2745
01:47:53,348 --> 01:47:54,583
Very good to see you.

2746
01:47:54,651 --> 01:47:55,752
Good to see you.

2747
01:47:55,819 --> 01:47:56,986
Take that jacket off.

2748
01:47:57,053 --> 01:47:58,655
- Should I say hi?
- Yeah.

2749
01:47:58,722 --> 01:47:59,789
<i>Hi! How you doing?</i>

2750
01:47:59,855 --> 01:48:00,991
Have a seat right there.

2751
01:48:02,793 --> 01:48:04,326
I was telling these kids
how I used to cut

2752
01:48:04,392 --> 01:48:06,329
your hair back in the day.
You sure did.

2753
01:48:06,396 --> 01:48:07,931
You was running
around here organizing.

2754
01:48:07,996 --> 01:48:09,266
You know, I gotta
get a picture of this.

2755
01:48:09,331 --> 01:48:10,633
<i>Calvin, take this picture. Yeah.</i>

2756
01:48:10,700 --> 01:48:11,768
Bam!

2757
01:48:11,834 --> 01:48:13,236
How you doing, Mr. President?

2758
01:48:13,303 --> 01:48:14,838
My name's Calvin.

2759
01:48:14,905 --> 01:48:16,572
I own the shop
with Angie right here.

2760
01:48:16,639 --> 01:48:17,840
- I'm Angie. Hi.
- Yeah.

2761
01:48:17,907 --> 01:48:19,107
<i>We appreciate your small business.</i>

2762
01:48:19,174 --> 01:48:21,142
Hey, Mr. President.
New Democrat right here.

2763
01:48:21,209 --> 01:48:22,578
All right! Congratulations!

2764
01:48:24,213 --> 01:48:25,614
Stop acting all nervous, Eddie.

2765
01:48:25,682 --> 01:48:26,683
You know, you know what
you're doing. Come on, man.

2766
01:48:26,749 --> 01:48:27,917
I cut the man's hair years ago.

2767
01:48:27,984 --> 01:48:29,185
I know what I'm doing right here.

2768
01:48:30,386 --> 01:48:31,922
Mr. President, I just want to say,

2769
01:48:31,987 --> 01:48:33,322
you know, I really love
what you've done

2770
01:48:33,389 --> 01:48:34,657
for the black community.

2771
01:48:34,723 --> 01:48:36,458
<i>All right.
And I'm loving those pants.</i>

2772
01:48:36,526 --> 01:48:38,595
- Thank you.
- Appreciate your patriotism.

2773
01:48:38,660 --> 01:48:39,962
I salute you, too.

2774
01:48:41,731 --> 01:48:43,366
Barry. Come on, now.

2775
01:48:43,432 --> 01:48:44,601
I'm sorry.

2776
01:48:44,667 --> 01:48:47,102
Okay, here we go. Low like
you always do?

2777
01:48:47,169 --> 01:48:48,838
Come on, now, hook your man up.

2778
01:48:48,905 --> 01:48:50,773
- Little bit.
- Are you shaking, Eddie?

2779
01:48:50,839 --> 01:48:52,441
Eddie, you got it.

2780
01:48:52,508 --> 01:48:54,043
Come on, Eddie. Represent now.

2781
01:48:59,949 --> 01:49:01,317
<i>Eddie!</i>

2782
01:49:01,383 --> 01:49:02,918
One-Stop,

2783
01:49:03,852 --> 01:49:05,254
you got some salve?

2784
01:49:06,388 --> 01:49:08,123
<i>I can fix it! I can fix it!</i>

2785
01:49:08,190 --> 01:49:09,326
<i>Sit back down!</i>
