0
00:02:32,288 --> 00:02:35,223
这是关于我哥哥奇怪的犯罪行为
This is
the story of my older brother's...

1
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:37,892
并且消失的故事
strange criminal behavior
and disappearance.

2
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:40,896
我们都没有在他面前谈到韦德
We who loved him
no longer speak of Wade.

3
00:02:40,964 --> 00:02:43,956
就像他不曾存在似的
It's as if he never existed.

4
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:48,197
为了不让这故事太单调
By telling his story like this,
by breaking the silence about him,

5
00:02:48,271 --> 00:02:50,364
我也谈一下自己的故事，事关重要
I tell my own story as well.

6
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,967
因每件事都
Everything of importance,

7
00:02:52,042 --> 00:02:55,478
和这息息相关
that is everything that gives rise
to the telling of this story,

8
00:02:55,546 --> 00:02:57,946
事情发生于猎鹿的季节
occurred during a single
deer-hunting season...

9
00:02:58,015 --> 00:03:02,349
韦德出生在偏僻的新曾郡
in a small town in upstate New Hampshire
where Wade was raised,

10
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:04,512
我也是
and so was I.

11
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:08,684
有一晚，事情有了点变化，我和韦德的关系可不同
One night something changed,
and my relation
to Wade's story was different...

12
00:03:08,759 --> 00:03:11,592
因那可是从小童年开始的
from what it had been
since childhood.

13
00:03:11,662 --> 00:03:13,892
韦德的声音标志着变化的开始
I mark this change
by Wade's tone of voice...

14
00:03:13,964 --> 00:03:16,956
也是从万圣节发生的
during a phone call
a night after Halloween.

15
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:19,832
也是我闻所未闻的声音
Something I had not heard before.

16
00:03:19,903 --> 00:03:23,304
在万圣节前夜大概八点
Let us imagine that around 8:00
on Halloween Eve...

17
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:27,810
来了一辆八的老警车，上面有警报灯
comes a pale blue, eight-year-old
Plymouth with a police bubble on top.

18
00:03:27,878 --> 00:03:31,905
一个穿着警服的国字脸男人坐在上面开着车
A square-faced man wearing
a police jacket is driving the vehicle.

19
00:03:31,982 --> 00:03:33,916
他旁边坐了一个小孩
Beside him sits a child,

20
00:03:33,984 --> 00:03:38,045
一个带着老虎面具的女孩
a little girl with
a plastic tiger mask covering her face.

21
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,153
对不起，我可做不到
Sorry for the screw-up.
I couldn't help it.

22
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:45,093
这太晚了，不能去扮鬼吓人了
It's too late
to go trick or treating.

23
00:03:45,162 --> 00:03:49,360
你饿了，就带你去吃东西，你很饿了，是吗？
I had to stop at Penney's to get
your costume, then you were hungry.

24
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:52,368
这难道不是你的错吗？
Whose fault is it then
if it's not yours?

25
00:03:52,436 --> 00:03:54,427
爸爸，你可是这里的负责人
You're the one in charge, Dad.

26
00:03:54,504 --> 00:03:56,495
嗯
Yeah.

27
00:03:56,573 --> 00:04:00,907
看，那些孩子还在外面玩扮鬼，他们还在外面，那可是调皮小孩
Look, those kids are still
trick-or-treating. They're still out.

28
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:05,540
我可不管，他们在外面玩
- Those are the Hoyts.
- I don't care. They're out!

29
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:08,983
你看，太晚了
Can't you see? Look out there.
It's just too late.

30
00:04:09,052 --> 00:04:13,148
那些坏孩子会出来惹麻烦的
Those Hoyt kids,
they're just out to get in trouble.

31
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:16,920
看，他们在捣蛋了
See, look. They put shaving cream
all over that mailbox.

32
00:04:16,994 --> 00:04:20,054
他们为何要这样干，干什么？
- Why did they do that?
- Do what?

33
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,530
你懂的，破坏吗？
- You know.
- Break stuff?

34
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,897
是啊，这是做傻事
Yeah. It's stupid.

35
00:04:24,968 --> 00:04:28,369
我想他们是很笨
Well... I guess
they're stupid.

36
00:04:28,438 --> 00:04:30,929
你小时候也是这样吗？
Did you do that stuff
when you were a kid?

37
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:33,033
不会
No!

38
00:04:34,344 --> 00:04:36,403
有时
Well, sort of.

39
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,439
这可说不定，我和我的伙伴和兄弟
Nothing really mean.
Me and my pals. Me and my brothers.

40
00:04:40,517 --> 00:04:42,747
那时可真过瘾
It was kind of funny then.

41
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,256
但现在可没趣了，对，这可没趣了
- But it's not funny now.
- No, no. It's not funny now.

42
00:04:47,324 --> 00:04:50,521
我是警察，我可得处理民事纠纷
I'm a cop. I gotta listen to
the complaints people make.

43
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:53,461
不再是孩子了，变了
I'm not a kid anymore.
You change.

44
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,499
我猜你小时是个坏孩子
I bet you did a lot of bad stuff
when you were a kid.

45
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:58,591
为什么有这种想法
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:58,669 --> 00:05:02,696
我也不清楚，只是感觉
- I don't know.
I just think you used to be bad.
- No.

47
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:05,435
不是的
No.

48
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,307
我可不是个坏孩子
I didn't used to be bad.

49
00:05:08,378 --> 00:05:11,108
不是了
No, sir!

50
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:13,706
谁告诉你的？你妈妈
Where do you get this stuff from?
Your mother?

51
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:17,242
不，她可从未提过你
No. She doesn't talk
about you anymore.

52
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:50,880
你们　韦德
Hey, Wade.

53
00:05:58,929 --> 00:06:01,898
各位，拉得维亚公司
Ladies and gentlemen,
LaRiviere Company...

54
00:06:01,965 --> 00:06:06,629
可是代理这各式各样的装饰品
is proud to sponsor another
annual Lawford costume parade.

55
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:10,730
我们要发明最可怕
We are looking for the funniest costume,
the scariest...

56
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:14,106
最得意的面具，它可怕吗？那个可怕吗？
Oh, the scariest!
Is he the scariest? Is that one scary?

57
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:16,236
他呢？可怕吗？
What about this?
Is he scary?

58
00:06:16,313 --> 00:06:20,306
那边那个也很可怕
No, no. Here's the scary one
right there.

59
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:23,512
最特别的装饰服
The most imaginative
and the best costume of all.

60
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:25,680
把我和孩子连在一起了
Help me line the kids up.

61
00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:28,850
可爱吗？你好，玛格，嗨，韦德
- Pretty awesome, huh? Hi, Marge.
- Hi, Wade.

62
00:06:28,925 --> 00:06:32,053
到那去比赛你可以赢奖品的
Go ahead, jump in line.
Maybe you'll win a prize.

63
00:06:33,296 --> 00:06:37,062
去吧，你可以认识一些孩子的
Go on. Some of those kids
you still know!

64
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:42,433
我想去，为什么？
- I don't want to.
- Oh, why? Why not?

65
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:44,997
那些可都是你的校友
You know these kids
from when you went to school here.

66
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:47,270
才没见一会
It hasn't been that long.

67
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,642
不是这意思，那是什么？
- It's not that.
- What then?

68
00:06:49,713 --> 00:06:53,615
我不喜欢这里
I don't like it here.

69
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:58,177
吉尔，乖点，去热闹一下　
Oh, Jesus, Jill, come on.
Don't mess this up any more
than it's been messed up.

70
00:06:58,255 --> 00:07:02,658
快去和大伙们一起开心吧
Join the kids. You do that, before
you know you'll be happy as a clam.

71
00:07:02,726 --> 00:07:04,125
韦德
Wade!

72
00:07:04,194 --> 00:07:08,426
吉尔吗？快过来一起玩
Is that Jill?
Come on and join us. Come on!

73
00:07:08,498 --> 00:07:12,491
去
Go, go, go.
Go on. Go, go, go.

74
00:07:12,569 --> 00:07:14,901
对嘛，过来
That's it, come on.
Come on.

75
00:07:14,971 --> 00:07:17,201
给她让个位置吧
Here, make a place for her
on the stage.

76
00:07:17,274 --> 00:07:20,334
看了，老虎来了
Look out! Here comes a tiger!
She's coming through.

77
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,370
你们在干嘛？还有什么干的
- What are you boys up to?
- Same old shit.

78
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:28,748
看到那群混蛋今晚干的事吗？
You seen the damage these little
sons of bitches been raising tonight?

79
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:31,879
你快让开，我知道了
- Gonna have to move your pickup.
- I know.

80
00:07:31,955 --> 00:07:36,915
等一下，你可别介意
- Take a bite.
- Could use it. Don't mind of I do.

81
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:40,485
那拉利维亚的派对可真糟
LaRiviere's having
a hell of a time in there tonight.

82
00:07:40,564 --> 00:07:42,532
可都是可恶的节目
Master of fucking ceremonies.

83
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:45,261
你今天带来的枪在哪里
Where's that gun
you were bragging on today?

84
00:07:45,335 --> 00:07:47,929
让我看看
Let's look at it.

85
00:07:56,646 --> 00:08:00,207
哦....
Oh, ho-ho-ho.
Oh, ho-ho.

86
00:08:01,518 --> 00:08:05,045
给你，650？还是700美元
Mmm! Got you
for $650, $700?

87
00:08:05,122 --> 00:08:08,057
好，你今晚和吉尔一起了
- Nice.
- See you got Jill tonight.

88
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:11,617
你怎么可以这样？
How'd you manage that?

89
00:08:15,332 --> 00:08:18,130
快把货车开走
Don't forget to move your truck.

90
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:22,704
各位，今晚大家都开心
Ladies and gentlemen,
remember, there are no losers.

91
00:08:22,772 --> 00:08:24,740
个个都有奖品
Everybody gets a nice ribbon.

92
00:08:24,808 --> 00:08:28,005
现在这是送给最有创造力的孩子的
Now, here is our first award.
For the most imaginative...

93
00:08:33,049 --> 00:08:35,017
艾码，你看到吉尔了吗？
Alma, have you seen Jill?

94
00:08:35,085 --> 00:08:38,111
她到别处去了，你下周来看吗？
She's around somewhere.
Are you coming to see me next week?

95
00:08:38,188 --> 00:08:40,122
会来的
Yeah.

96
00:08:55,238 --> 00:08:57,570
挺热闹的是吧
Some party, huh?

97
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:03,808
对不起，我到外面抽烟去了
I'm sorry.
I had to step outside for a smoke.

98
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,611
看到熟人吗？你一定有熟人在里面
Find anybody you know? There must be
some kids you know from school.

99
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,247
你明天起走吗　看你原来的老师
Say, you want to go tomorrow?
See your old teachers?

100
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:14,256
不想　不想什么
- No.
- No what?

101
00:09:14,324 --> 00:09:19,057
我在这没熟人，我不想在这上学
No, I didn't see anybody I knew.
No, I don't want to go
to school here tomorrow!

102
00:09:19,129 --> 00:09:24,294
我想回家　吉尔这就是你的家
- I want to go home.
- Come on, Jill, you are home!

103
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:27,234
那边你也有很多旧同学
There's lots of kids
you still know here.

104
00:09:27,304 --> 00:09:31,297
爸爸别担心，我爱你的
Don't worry, Dad.
I love you. I do!

105
00:09:31,374 --> 00:09:33,399
但我想回家
But I want to go home.

106
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,751
好吧，我告诉你
All right, I tell you what.

107
00:09:48,825 --> 00:09:53,057
明早如果你还想回家的话　我就送你回去　下班就送你回
Tomorrow morning
if you still want to go home,
I'll drive you when I get off work.

108
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,324
好吗？
Okay?

109
00:09:55,398 --> 00:09:58,959
我打电话给妈妈了，什么，你叫了妈妈过来了？
- I called Mom.
- What? You called Mommy?

110
00:09:59,035 --> 00:10:01,003
现在？嗯
- Just now?
- Yeah.

111
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:03,869
天啊，你怎么不先告诉我一声
Jesus, why?
Why didn't you talk to me first?

112
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,774
我知道人你会生气的　对对我是很生气
- I knew you'd be mad.
- Well, yeah, honey, I am mad.

113
00:10:07,844 --> 00:10:10,404
你跟她说了什么？
You know.
What did you tell her, for chrissake?

114
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,778
我跟她说我想回家了
I told her I wanted to come home.

115
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:15,943
爸爸，别这么凶对我
Dad, don't be mad at me.

116
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,011
....
Well, I guess I am.

117
00:10:19,089 --> 00:10:22,183
好，我懂了
I mean, you know.

118
00:10:22,259 --> 00:10:26,491
我所做的一切
I planned this.
I planned all this.

119
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:30,863
所做的这些
Sort of pathetic. But I planned it.

120
00:10:33,637 --> 00:10:35,696
都是为了你　你不应该打电话给你妈妈
You shouldn't have
called your mother.

121
00:10:35,772 --> 00:10:39,003
快去给个电话叫她别来了
Come on, we're gonna call her
before she leaves.

122
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:01,023

Hi, this is the Horners.

123
00:11:01,097 --> 00:11:03,930

- Please leave a message at the beep.
- She's gone already.

124
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,696
她已经过来了，她等也不等一下就过来了
Gone already!
She couldn't wait.

125
00:11:09,939 --> 00:11:12,965
嗯，嗯？
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

126
00:11:13,043 --> 00:11:16,444
你就会说嗯吗？
That's all you've got to say,
is "yeah"?

127
00:11:16,513 --> 00:11:18,777
嗯
Yeah.

128
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:30,050
你知道你可要半个小时才能到这
You know, she won't be here
for a half hour.

129
00:11:30,126 --> 00:11:34,256
你可以发闷这么么久吗？嗯
- Think you can stand it that long?
- Yeah.

130
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,058
你想在这里等她
Where do you expect
to wait for her?

131
00:11:38,134 --> 00:11:41,160
和孩子们在下面热闹不好吗？
Obviously downstairs with
the other kids isn't good enough.

132
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:55,944
你在这等吧
Sit there by yourself
if you want.

133
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:59,477
一个人等你妈妈吧　我可在乎
Wait for her by yourself!
That's fine with me. Just dandy!

134
00:11:59,556 --> 00:12:02,423
我到楼下去　我宁愿在这等
- I'm goin' downstairs.
- It's fine with me too.

135
00:12:02,492 --> 00:12:05,518
妈妈来的时候告诉她我在这
When Mom comes,
tell her I'm up here.

136
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:22,704
我不是叫你把车开走吗
I thought I told you
to move that goddamn truck!

137
00:12:24,147 --> 00:12:26,513
别生气，我们现在就走
Relax, Chief.
We're leavin' now.

138
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,813
要来一口吗？
You want a toke?

139
00:12:28,885 --> 00:12:32,048
不用了，杰克
No, Jesus Christ, Jack!

140
00:12:35,325 --> 00:12:37,793
你他妈的干嘛还不走
Why don't you get
the fuck outta here?

141
00:12:37,861 --> 00:12:40,955
如果乔丹或其他人看到你在我面前
If Gordon or one of those guys see
you smoke that wacky tabacky around me,

142
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:43,658
抽大麻的话　那我就要失业了
they'll expect me to bust you,
and I'll be out of a goddamn job.

143
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:46,031
什么工作，来点
Some job!

144
00:12:46,102 --> 00:12:50,163
试试嘛　别老做顽固男了
Here, have a hit.
Don't be such a hardass.

145
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:54,336
我知道你烦，我们都烦，才要放轻松一下
I know you got problems.
We all got problems, so relax.

146
00:12:55,378 --> 00:12:57,437
不要在这里
Not here.

147
00:12:57,514 --> 00:13:02,042
进来吧　我到别的地方去
Well, come on, get in.
We'll take a little ride, my man.

148
00:13:05,722 --> 00:13:09,385
一年到头都是找工作
Got a job. First thing
in the morning. First day of season.

149
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:11,893
都是很烦人　埃文
Twombley something. Erwin...

150
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:15,089
是伊万吗？他可是人马萨州来的长官
Evan? He's
a union official from Massachusetts.

151
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:17,099
你可真走运
You're lucky.

152
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:19,727
你可要防止地区性的凶杀案
Gotta guarantee a kill, of course.

153
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:22,738
但这地区都遍地危机　
Which I can do. There are
some monster bucks hidin' out up there.

154
00:13:22,806 --> 00:13:25,468
你怎么样去找工作？找乔丹
- How'd you get the job?
- Gordon.

155
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:28,204
他可有很有办法
He's always got
some angle workin'.

156
00:13:28,278 --> 00:13:32,442
他要逗汤比利开心　我可他的小孩
He wants to keep Twombley happy,
I'm his boy.

157
00:13:32,515 --> 00:13:36,110
你怎么了？牙疼
- What's wrong with you?
- A toothache.

158
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:39,747
杰克，你应该多亲近一下他
You should get close to him, Jack.

159
00:13:39,823 --> 00:13:42,986
你要证明给他看你是不可替代的
Make yourself irreplaceable.
The guy is loaded.

160
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,223
像你和乔丹？
Like you and Gordon?

161
00:13:47,297 --> 00:13:51,961
对，那小子没我可不行
Right. The son of a bitch
couldn't get along without me.

162
00:13:52,035 --> 00:13:54,868
你失踪的话，他明天就惨了
Yeah, he'd go broke tomorrow
if you quit him.

163
00:13:54,938 --> 00:13:58,339
对
Right.

164
00:13:58,408 --> 00:14:00,638
这小子把高灯开了
Bastard's got his high beams on.
该死
- Shit!

165
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,337
什么
What?

166
00:14:02,412 --> 00:14:07,042
刚过去的奥迪车里是我的前妻莉莲跟和的丈夫　奥迪是好车
- That's my ex-wife Lillian
and her husband in the Audi.
- Audi's a good car.

167
00:14:07,116 --> 00:14:10,745
她来这里干嘛　她要带吉尔回去，我不想那样
- What's she here for?
- She's here to get Jill.
Me and Jill had an argument.

168
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,618
杰克，你快点掉头
Jack, I gotta get back to town.
Move this thing, will ya?

169
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,454
在他们到派对前赶回去，行吗？
See if you can get back to the town hall
before they get there, okay?

170
00:14:16,526 --> 00:14:21,190
没问题　拿着这个
- Piece of cake.
- Take this joint.

171
00:14:28,838 --> 00:14:30,772
莉莲
Lillian?

172
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,741

Lillian.

173
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:36,870
吉尔呢？
Where's Jill?

174
00:14:36,946 --> 00:14:39,540
我和吉尔有点误会
Me and Jill,
we had a little spat.

175
00:14:39,616 --> 00:14:42,449
她比较害怕陌生的孩子
She kind of felt left out
from not knowing the new kids.

176
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:45,352
她在哪里？她在车吗？
Where is she? Is she
in the truck with your friends?

177
00:14:45,421 --> 00:14:50,222
不，她说在里面等你
No. She told me she wanted
to wait for you inside.

178
00:14:51,528 --> 00:14:55,191
那你就和朋友出去喝酒了
While you went for
a few beers with your friends.

179
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,231
那车上的人是海迪.罗杰斯吗？
That Hettie Rogers in there
with what's-his-name?

180

00:15:00,303 --> 00:15:02,237
是他
Yeah.

181
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:05,934
天，那小女孩可长大了，对吗？
Boy, she's grown up
a little, hasn't she?

182
00:15:06,009 --> 00:15:08,000
你能别太见外吗
Jesus, lay off, will ya?

183
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:12,605
你是赢了，但能否给个机会给我
You've won this round,
so just lay off, for chrissake.

184
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:17,813
你别开玩笑了　这么久你还是老样子
You amaze me.
Year after year in the same old ways.

185
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:24,083
小子　别碰她
Horner, leave her be.

186
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,220
她和你没有什么关系了
It's got nothing to do with you,
so just act like a chauffeur.

187
00:15:27,297 --> 00:15:30,164
你知道吗？韦德　我们不要吵了
- You got it?
- Wade, nobody wants any trouble.

188
00:15:30,233 --> 00:15:32,258
听我说，我不想她回去
Listen to me.
I don't want her to go.

189
00:15:32,335 --> 00:15:35,930
别傻了，这可没有什么大赢家
Please don't make a scene.
Nobody is trying to win any round.

190
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:38,064
别恶化这事了
Don't make this any worse.

191
00:15:38,141 --> 00:15:40,666
恶化它的是你。　我？
- I'm not making it any worse. You are!
- Me?

192
00:15:40,743 --> 00:15:43,234
我和吉尔本来可以好好生活的
Me and Jill,
we could've worked this out.

193
00:15:43,313 --> 00:15:46,043
这都是很正常，这是父女间的事
- It's normal.
It's a father-daughter thing.
- She called me.

194
00:15:46,115 --> 00:15:49,915
我知道她给你打电话了，你这又算那般
I know she called you.
How do you think this makes me look?

195
00:15:49,953 --> 00:15:54,151
这小孩可是无辜的，让她留下。我不会答应你这么做的
- Coming up here and treating her
like some tragic victim.
- I'm not gonna do this.

196
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,852
你干什么，该死的
Just wait till
we're through, goddamn it!

197
00:16:02,665 --> 00:16:04,860
别说话
Don't say a word.

198
00:16:08,071 --> 00:16:10,266
我可没动他
I didn't hit him.

199
00:16:15,411 --> 00:16:18,073
我不会打任何人
I'm not gonna hit anybody.

200
00:16:49,412 --> 00:16:52,939
新帽子啊
New hat!

201
00:16:53,016 --> 00:16:56,713
不是，我看到吉尔在上面　对，她呆了一会
- Jill's up, I see.
- Yeah, for a while.

202
00:16:56,786 --> 00:17:01,280
她怎么了？她很好
- How's she doing?
- She's okay. She's fine.

203
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:05,123
你们俩明天要如果需要其他人帮忙的话找我吧　好的
You two want to do anything, need
a third party, give me a call. I'm off.

204
00:17:05,194 --> 00:17:08,254
明天是猎鹿节的第一天　
Like hell you are. Tomorrow's
the first day of deer-huntin' season.

205
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:11,994
我要你明天早点到　自己保重　韦德
I'll need you at least in the mornin'.
Take care, Wade.

206
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:15,526
好了，也差不多了
Well, I guess that's that.

207
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:17,937
你可得小心那些小鬼
You be careful
of that little bastard.

208
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:22,740
他们会躲进你的裤子里　你别这样吓唬我好吗
- He's dyin' to get in your pants.
- Come on. Give me a break.

209
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:26,043
明天见　好的
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Okay.

210
00:17:35,425 --> 00:17:38,588
明天见　乔丹　嗯
- Tomorrow, Gordon.
- Hmm.

211
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:42,688
今晚就会下雪了
Watch the snow.
It's coming down tonight.

212
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:58,078
这种天气最适合捕杀坏蛋吗？
This weather
any advantage in tracking the bastards?

213
00:17:58,147 --> 00:18:00,707
别担心，汤比利先生　我知道鹿的脾性
Don't worry, Mr. Twombley,
I know where those suckers are.

214
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:03,843
就像现在，那片丛林里鹿就少
Right about now, the does
are holding up in the brush piles.

215
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,582
鹿总爱躲在那里的
The bucks are
right behind the does.

216
00:18:06,656 --> 00:18:08,624
我们也到那去
We're right behind the bucks.

217
00:18:08,691 --> 00:18:12,092
十点前就会找到鹿的
That gun gets fired before 10:00.

218
00:18:12,161 --> 00:18:16,063
不管它射不射得中猎物　我都会给一个机会施展身手
Whether it kills a deer or not,
more or less up to you.

219
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:20,228
大约离鹿三十到三十五码
I'll put you inside 30, 35 yards of
a buck first four hours of the season.

220
00:18:20,303 --> 00:18:24,171
要不可不敢收你的钱　是吧
- That's what you're
paying me for, ain't it?
- Damn straight.

221
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,267
心直口快啊　对步枪有研究吗
Done much shootin'
with that rifle yet?

222
00:18:28,344 --> 00:18:32,906
我告诉你，如果在十点能找到一只鹿的话
I'll tell you what, kid.
You get me close to a big buck
by 10:00 in the mornin',

223
00:18:32,982 --> 00:18:35,507
我多给一百块小费
there's an extra $100 in it.

224
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:40,019
如果你捉住它的话？是的
- If you get it?
- Yeah.

225
00:18:40,089 --> 00:18:42,489
可能你不会杀它的，你认为呢？
- You might not kill it.
- You think so?

226
00:18:42,558 --> 00:18:46,324
你可能会打伤它　然后被其他人捡到
You might gut-shoot it. Cripple it
for somebody else to find and tag.

227
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:50,661
不能保证不会发生这样的事情　特别是拿着新的枪
Can't guarantee that won't happen,
especially with a new gun.

228
00:18:51,834 --> 00:18:54,166
我也打它一枪吧
I may have to shoot it.

229
00:18:54,237 --> 00:18:57,968
我们还是各顾各的吧
- You take care of your end,
I'll take care of mine.
- Mm-hmm.

230
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,008
你明白我说的吗
You understand what I'm sayin'?

231
00:19:00,076 --> 00:19:04,376
我要的是死鹿　不是还会跑那种　我明白了
- I want a deer, a dead one.
Not a cripple.
- I get it.

232
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:08,508
不用费多大功夫你就可以打到鹿了　然后你还有时间喝咖啡
No sweat. You'll get yourself
a deer, dead, by coffee time.

233
00:19:08,584 --> 00:19:12,714
那你会有一百块小费了　太好了
- And you'll get your extra $100.
- Wonderful.

234
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:22,228
早上好　杰森　早
- Good morning, Jason.
- Good morning, Miss Brooks.

235
00:19:23,633 --> 00:19:25,897
早上好
Morning.

236
00:19:28,604 --> 00:19:30,697

Hi, Melanie.

237
00:19:33,743 --> 00:19:36,234
韦德　吉尔呢
Wade? Where's Jill?

238
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,906
我还以为她今天来上学的
I thought she was coming
to school today.

239
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:43,778
爸爸别担心，我爱你
Don't worry, Dad. I love you. I do!

240
00:19:43,853 --> 00:19:47,016
但我明天还是不想来这里上学
But I don't want to go
to school here tomorrow.

241
00:19:58,734 --> 00:20:02,966
老兄时间到了　我们要走了
For Pete's sake, Whitehouse,
we ain't got all day!

242
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:17,446
你没事吧　韦德
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong?

243
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,546
你干嘛呀　发什么呆
Why were you holding everyone up?

244
00:20:20,623 --> 00:20:23,786
你看到那坐宝马的家伙吗　他一定是杀了人要跑路了
Did you see that son of a bitch in that
B.M.W? He could've killed somebody.

245
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,794
你有他的号码吗？我知道他是谁
- Did you get his number?
- Yeah, I know who it is.

246
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,830
那就好，梅尔.乔丹
- Good.
- Mel Gordon.

247
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:32,630
他从波士顿来的　是汤比利的侄子　他们要去阿加威湖
He's from Boston.
He's Evan Twombley's son-in-law.
They're headed to Lake Agaway.

248
00:20:32,702 --> 00:20:36,798
那老家伙和杰克去打鹿去了　我找他们麻烦去
The old man's out hunting with Jack.
I'm gonna spoil his weekend.

249
00:20:36,873 --> 00:20:39,273
别，韦德
Now, Wade...

250
00:20:39,342 --> 00:20:42,505
上了安全扣了吗？嗯
- Safety on?
- Mm-hmm.

251
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:52,017
我没事
I'm all right.

252
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,281
跟着我　我们穿过那片树林
Stay with me.
We'll cross into the next meadow.

253
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:59,021
我以前见过你
I've seen you before.

254
00:20:59,095 --> 00:21:01,757
我以前踢球的　是吗？
- I used to play ball.
- Yeah?

255
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:05,528
在红袜队中作清道夫　你在红袜队啊？
- Drafted by the Red Sox.
- You played for the Sox?

256
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:08,968
在新不列颠打双Ａ后卫
- Double-A. New Britain.
- Oh.

257
00:21:09,038 --> 00:21:13,634
投手自从卡尔顿.菲克斯之后　最佳球员都是来自新汉普郡
Pitcher. Best ballplayer to come out
of New Hampshire since Carlton Fisk.

258
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:16,837
真的？他们是这么说的
- Really?
- They said.

259
00:21:16,913 --> 00:21:22,010
我只是不太走运
Only difference between me
and that Clemens on TV is shit luck.

260
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,246
上子弹没？上了
- Safety on?
- Yeah.

261
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:30,781
就在前面　太阳出来了
- Just ahead.
- Sun's gettin' high.

262
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:34,554
鹿长有耳朵的
Deers have ears too, you know.

263
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,996
对哦
Oh, yeah.

264
00:22:12,034 --> 00:22:16,334
这很简单，他们要么清理拖车或者它被拖走了
It's simple.
Either they clean up the trailer
or it gets hauled out.

265
00:22:16,405 --> 00:22:18,339
这简直是混帐
It looks like a piece of shit.

266
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:20,739
对　那就叫山脉风景吧
That's right.
It's called mountain view.

267
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:23,301
但现在都不像样了
Looks like shit view right now.

268
00:22:23,379 --> 00:22:26,143
告诉他们如果不搬的话　我就去帮他搬
Tell them if they don't move it,
I'll come out and have it moved.

269
00:22:26,215 --> 00:22:28,149
走了　迟些再打给你
I gotta go. I'll call you later.

270
00:22:33,356 --> 00:22:36,154
我说过会下雪的
Told you the snow was coming down.

271
00:22:36,225 --> 00:22:39,160
拿铲子去吧
Take the grader.

272
00:22:39,228 --> 00:22:42,425
犁呢？吉米拿了
- Where's the plow?
- Jimmy took it.

273
00:22:42,498 --> 00:22:44,659

Jack's out hunting
with Evan Twombley.

274
00:22:44,734 --> 00:22:48,033
杰克和汤比利去打猎了　他的侄子早上差点干掉我了　
- His son-in-law damn near
killed me this morning.
- Huh?

275
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:52,234
在学校门口开快车真是不要命了　我要教训他
At the school crossing. Could've hurt
some kids. I'm gonna bust his ass!

276
00:22:52,308 --> 00:22:54,833
别在这装样子
Don't go playing policeman.

277
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:58,209
那我是什么　保安吗
What the hell am I?
A security guard?

278
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,647
你雇用我　你的朋友可没有啊
I mean, you hired me.
You and your selectmen friends.

279
00:23:01,717 --> 00:23:05,380
你不想挣外块吗
You don't want
the extra police pay?

280
00:23:05,454 --> 00:23:08,218
我可没那样说过
I'm not sayin' that!

281
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:14,295
拿着雪铲到图比那去吧
Take the grader.
Go out 29 past Toby's.

282
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:16,991
别叫莉莲来了　她不属于这里
Don't let Lillian get to you.
She didn't belong here.

283
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:19,091
这也是她离开的原因　尼玛
- That's why she left.
- Fuck you.

284
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:22,069
这也是我喜欢小镇的原因
That's what I love
about a small town.

285
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:24,834
你对每个人都很了解
ou know everybody.

286
00:23:32,648 --> 00:23:34,912
近了
Stay close.

287
00:23:37,953 --> 00:23:39,887
新脚印
Fresh tracks.

288
00:23:42,091 --> 00:23:44,924
鹿粪　可是头大鹿
Deer shit. Big one.

289
00:23:44,994 --> 00:23:47,292
汤比处先生　你的鹿
Here's your buck,
Mr. Twombley.

290
00:23:47,363 --> 00:23:49,524
我下去看一下
I'll go down and circle around.

291
00:23:49,598 --> 00:23:54,695
为了那一百块　你得辛苦一下了
You only got a little while
if you wanna collect that extra $100.

292
00:25:32,168 --> 00:25:35,103
嘿　怎么样了？
Hey. How's it goin'?

293
00:25:35,171 --> 00:25:38,106
好冷啊　你说呢
Cold. How do you think?

294
00:25:38,174 --> 00:25:41,166
说点事给我听
Yeah, sorry about that.
Tell me something.

295
00:25:41,243 --> 00:25:45,179
为什么你总在下雪天来这里喝酒
Why is it every year come first snow
you always get stuck with that grader?

296
00:25:45,247 --> 00:25:47,374
因为我要看着学校的十字路口
School. Traffic crossing.

297
00:25:47,449 --> 00:25:51,078
然后你会怎么干，挖井吗？
- So what are we doing after?
Digging wells?
- Yeah.

298
00:25:51,153 --> 00:25:53,986
别干嘛太快　好吗
Don't work too fast, all right?

299
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:56,217
事情总有它的发展规律的
Business being the way it is,

300
00:25:56,292 --> 00:25:59,625
乔丹也老是在找借口来骂我
Gordon's looking for any reason
to lay me off earlier than usual.

301
00:25:59,695 --> 00:26:01,822
这人可是太富有了
That border jumper's got too much money
as it is.

302
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:05,230
我告诉你那就是怀豪斯
I'll tell you who's a pisser.
Glen Whitehouse.

303
00:26:05,301 --> 00:26:07,235
他也很平凡
He was mean normal.

304
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:11,103
但一喝酒就发疯了
But when he drank,
it was like he burst on fire.

305
00:26:11,173 --> 00:26:15,735
加拿大人都爱喝烈酒的
Brown's Canadian.
Always drank B.C.

306
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:19,577
有次圣诞节　他忘了有一堆木头在外面
One Christmas, there was this cord
of wood out back he'd forgotten about.

307
00:26:19,648 --> 00:26:22,742
他决定叫他的孩子去拿
He decides he's gonna have
his boys stack it.

308
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:27,050
都已经放了两个月了　木头都结冰了
Except it's been out back
for two months. The wood's all iced in.

309
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:31,183
但他却把两个儿子都叫出去　而自己在喝酒
He grabs the boys, throws them outside.
And he's drunk.

310
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:34,627
来　搬开它
Oh! Come on, move it.

311
00:26:34,697 --> 00:26:37,825
多美的雪光
Daylight in the swamp.

312
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,530
爸　孩子们在等，鲁夫
- Pop, the kids are waiting for us.
- Rolfe.

313
00:26:42,605 --> 00:26:46,541
这可是在平时学到的东西
A lesson in work
and its rewards.

314
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:50,340
你们总有一天会感谢我的　来吧
You'll thank me for this one day, boys.
Now, come on.

315
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:58,411
孩子　快挖
Here we are, boys. Dig in.

316
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:00,648
快　在这挖你们看到吗
Come on, let's do it right over here.
See that?

317
00:27:00,723 --> 00:27:03,453
快，快挖
Goddamn it!
Let's do it!

318
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:05,652
使点力出来
Show a little muscle there.
Come on.

319
00:27:07,963 --> 00:27:12,127

There! There we go.

320
00:27:12,201 --> 00:27:14,135
好样的
Attaboy. Come on!

321
00:27:14,203 --> 00:27:16,831
爸爸，我们回去吧
Please, Pop, let's go back.

322
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,174
你要作懦夫吗
What the hell are you,
a quitter?

323
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:22,472
做懦夫吗
Huh? Get in there!

324
00:27:22,544 --> 00:27:25,069

Quitter? Huh? Huh?

325
00:27:25,147 --> 00:27:28,310
接着发生什么事了　他打我了
- So what happened?
- Oh, beats me.

326
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,081
但这可能问韦德就清楚了
That's all I heard.
Wade would know more about it. Wade?

327
00:27:32,154 --> 00:27:36,523
韦德　我们在聊你爸说的：你要做懦夫吗？
We were just talkin' about your old man.
"What are you, a quitter?"

328
00:27:40,095 --> 00:27:45,294
天啊　你还有很多重要的事情做　比坐在这里讲故事好得多
Jesus, LaCoy, you got nothing better
to do than tell stories?

329
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:49,565
遗憾的是　某天有大学生听到这事的话
The pity is, someday
some college student will come in here
and believe this shit...

330
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:53,301
他们全把你的事写成书的
'cause you're the only one
dumb enough to talk to him.

331
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:15,155
这就是工作
That was some job.

332
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:19,667
我保证　我们会做的
We'll work at it, we promise.

333
00:28:19,735 --> 00:28:22,397
我知道了　你只知道喝酒
- I think I made a point.
- You just need a drink.

334
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:24,735
韦德　你刚说什么
What was that, Wade?

335
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:28,208
你说什么？
You say something?

336
00:28:28,277 --> 00:28:31,735
你再说一次　说啊
You got something to say, say it.
Say it!

337
00:28:31,814 --> 00:28:33,839
你这混小子
You no good pup!

338
00:28:33,916 --> 00:28:35,816
妈
Mom!

339
00:28:38,987 --> 00:28:41,683
嗯　妈
- Well?
- Mom!

340
00:28:42,958 --> 00:28:45,222
..
Mom!

341
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:49,054
..
Mom! Mom!

342
00:29:03,579 --> 00:29:06,013
别看右边
Don't look right.

343
00:29:06,081 --> 00:29:08,777
那招牌
The sign.

344
00:29:08,851 --> 00:29:12,150
好像是拼错了字母　没有啊
Looks like it's spelled wrong
or somethin'.

345
00:29:12,221 --> 00:29:16,885
韦德　你这种人可以让这城市振兴繁荣吗
Ahh. Wade, Wade. It's people like you
who keep this town from prospering.

346
00:29:16,959 --> 00:29:19,519
我没觉得有什么不妥　我是为你好　这好多的城镇　
I'm not finding fault. It's good
for you. It's good for the town.

347
00:29:19,595 --> 00:29:22,063
这是不错的主意　对
- It's a good idea.
- Yeah.

348
00:29:22,131 --> 00:29:25,828
你在干嘛　那些人是雇来搞建设的
What did you do? Hire one of
those hippie craftsman from Concord?

349
00:29:25,901 --> 00:29:27,835
你可找到了有用之村
Think you're gettin'
something you can use,

350
00:29:27,903 --> 00:29:30,371
这可是工作的艺术
only it turns out to be
a work of art?

351
00:29:30,439 --> 00:29:35,035
无论谁在这里想进步　你都阻拦人家
Whatever somebody does to improve things
around here, you gotta find fault.

352
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,203
得了
- Is that it?
- Come on.

353
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,477
我只是说你的招牌有错误
I'm only sayin' there's something wrong
with "Homemade Cooking."

354
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:45,008
招牌很好，谁说不好
The sign's fine.
What it says is wrong.

355
00:29:45,087 --> 00:29:47,681
谁要　来这里的可都是熟客
Who needs it? Everybody that
comes here, been coming here for years.

356
00:29:47,756 --> 00:29:50,122
为什么要看那招牌
What do we need a sign for?

357
00:29:50,192 --> 00:29:52,251
但我觉得这比以前更好
But I guess it's better
than what was there before.

358
00:29:52,327 --> 00:29:57,458
这以前怎么了　没什么
- What was there before?
- Nothin'.

359
00:29:57,533 --> 00:30:00,468
这以前什么也没有
There was nothin' here before.

360
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:02,470

Hmm.

361
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,631
你还好吧　嗯
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

362
00:30:08,177 --> 00:30:11,010
对我以前说的话抱歉
I'm sorry about what I said.

363
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:16,381
你说了什么　就那个你和吉尔需要第三者的事
- What'd you say?
- About you and Jill
and needing a third person.

364
00:30:16,452 --> 00:30:19,250
她回到莉莲那里吗？嗯
- She went back with Lillian?
- Yeah.

365
00:30:19,321 --> 00:30:22,518
对不起　算了吧
- Yeah. Forget it.
- I'm sorry.

366
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:27,126
我会开始新的生活的
I'm gonna start me
one of those custody suits.

367
00:30:27,196 --> 00:30:29,756
我不会再自暴自弃了　不要这样说
- I don't give a fucking shit anymore!
- You don't mean that.

368
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:33,859
我会的　你在找借口安慰我
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't. You're just pissed.

369
00:30:33,936 --> 00:30:38,498
该冷静几天　然后和莉莲谈一下
You just oughta cool off for a few days,
then have a long talk with Lillian.

370
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:41,202
把我的感受都告诉她
Work it out with her.
Tell her how you feel.

371
00:30:41,276 --> 00:30:43,904
莉莲的心肠很软的　她不会的
- Lillian's not out to get you.
- The hell she isn't!

372
00:30:43,979 --> 00:30:47,608
莉莲自从我认识她那天就没对我好过
Lillian's been trying to nail me
to a cross since the day I met her.

373
00:30:47,683 --> 00:30:52,677
我得找个律师处理一下离婚的事
I'm gonna get me a lawyer from Concord,
and get this divorce thing rearranged.

374
00:30:52,754 --> 00:30:56,383
玛格　这鬼女人
- Marge?
- That goddamn woman.

375
00:30:56,458 --> 00:31:00,019
她想这样来打击我　我可不会放在心上的
She thinks she can cart Jill off
and leave me alone like this.

376
00:31:00,095 --> 00:31:02,859

I'm a whole lot more than pissed.

377
00:31:02,931 --> 00:31:05,764
我可活了半辈子了　深知这一切的虚幻
I've been there plenty in my life,
and I know the difference.

378
00:31:05,834 --> 00:31:07,927
这可有大区别
And this is different.

379
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:10,335
玛格　现在需要你了
Marge, you got orders.

380
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,202
打电话给我
Call me.

381
00:31:14,276 --> 00:31:18,474
今晚我去找你　好的
- Tonight. Let's get together tonight.
- Okay.

382
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:26,176
见到杰克了？没有，他和人家今天早上去打猎了
- Talked to Jack?
- Nah. Not since last night.
He took a guy hunting.

383
00:31:26,255 --> 00:31:29,452
那人自己打伤自己了　
The fucker shot himself. Ker-bang!
That's what it sounded like.

384
00:31:29,525 --> 00:31:31,550
毫无目的的打中了自己　这可能是意外
Not on purpose.
I assume accidental.

385
00:31:31,627 --> 00:31:33,618
谁？杰克　不　另外一个人
- Who? Jack?
- The other guy.

386
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:35,822
你怎么知道的　是对讲机说的
- How'd you hear this?
- C.B., a little while ago.

387
00:31:35,898 --> 00:31:39,163
是杰克用对讲机求救的
One of the boys comin' in. Jack on
the C.B. Callin' for state troopers.

388
00:31:39,234 --> 00:31:41,498
我还以为你早知道了
I figured you'd know
what really happened.

389
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,767
我整个上午都是在铲雪　汤比利就是那个来度假的有钱人
I was on the grader. Twombley,
summer people from Massachusetts.

390
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,276
乔丹的朋友　是乔丹叫杰克去陪他的
Friend of Gordon's. It was Gordon's idea
for Jack to take him hunting.

391
00:31:48,343 --> 00:31:50,834
噢　我得去看一下
Oh, boy. I gotta go.

392
00:31:50,913 --> 00:31:55,145
我要你再做一遍　我不满意这句
I want you to work on
a new logo for that. I don't like that.

393
00:31:55,217 --> 00:31:59,119
好的　在这里建一座山
- All righty.
- Put an idea of a mountain down there.

394
00:31:59,187 --> 00:32:01,678
又可以挡住狂风
Something like that
with a stream below.

395
00:32:01,757 --> 00:32:04,624
有什么事？打猎那边出事了　杰克和汤比利那边
- What's the hurry?
- Hunting accident. Jack and Twombley.

396
00:32:04,693 --> 00:32:08,356
我以为你知道了　汤比利那快去看看
- I figured you would've heard.
- Twombley! Jesus! Get moving.

397
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,558
我要到那去　我鬼知道...有人搬东西吗
I gotta get up there. How would I have
heard? Have somebody move the grader.

398
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:19,231
来　你开车
Go on. Go on! You drive.
We'll take my truck.

399
00:32:23,512 --> 00:32:25,412
关了
Turn it off.

400
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,381
你只听说了这些吗
All you heard was there was
some kind of accident?

401
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:30,577
我听说是汤比利中枪了
Twombley's shot. I heard that.

402
00:32:30,652 --> 00:32:32,677
杰克没事　一定会没事的
Jack's okay, I assume.

403
00:32:32,754 --> 00:32:35,621
你不知道这事有多严重　你是说汤比利？
- You don't know how bad or anything?
- You mean Twombley?

404
00:32:35,691 --> 00:32:38,251
对　就是他
Yes, Wade.
I mean Twombley.

405
00:32:38,327 --> 00:32:40,591
不要再抽烟了
Put out that cigarette!

406
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:42,721
靠...
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

407
00:32:42,798 --> 00:32:45,665
可能只是打中脚　
Probably shot himself
in the foot or somethin'.

408
00:32:45,734 --> 00:32:47,668
这经常发生的
That's what usually happens.

409
00:32:47,736 --> 00:32:50,967
我本想叫你去陪杰克的　不过现在迟了
- I should've sent you instead of Jack.
- I wish you had.

410
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,668
我可不想自己在冰雪中被冻死掉
I'd rather be deer huntin' than freezin'
my ass off on that fuckin' grader.

411
00:32:54,743 --> 00:32:58,372
但你可是经验老道的警察　
Well, you ain't the hunter Jack is, and
he can't drive the grader worth shit.

412

00:32:58,447 --> 00:33:00,847
像地狱一样
ike hell!

413
00:33:02,684 --> 00:33:07,587
那一定是汤比利　要我跟上去吗
- That must've been Twombley.
- Want me to follow them to Littleton?

414
00:33:07,656 --> 00:33:11,922
不用　我们先上去看看再说
No, no, let's go to the top.
Talk to Jack first.

415
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:15,430
杰克一定知道这他妈的发生了什么事
He'll know what happened.
He best fucking better know!

416
00:33:24,106 --> 00:33:26,131
那是杰克
There's Jack.

417
00:33:27,542 --> 00:33:29,567
呼叫105频道
I clocked 105.

418
00:33:29,645 --> 00:33:32,375
105？这倒挺快的
105? That was pretty fast.

419
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:37,384
就像过周末的人一样
Turns out to be
one of these kids up for the weekend.

420
00:33:37,452 --> 00:33:42,253
他说长官　我不想看见这　给我一百块吧
She says, "Officer, can we make this
disappear?" Shows me $100 bill.

421
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:45,225
收到消息了吗？
Heard the news?

422
00:33:45,293 --> 00:33:47,488
我听说汤比利中枪了　嗯是的
- I heard Twombley got shot.
- Yeah.

423
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:49,655
小心那狗　韦德
Watch the dog, Wade.

424
00:33:49,731 --> 00:33:52,666
不然它会咬掉你的脑袋　它就像我一样
- Takes a mind to,
he'll take your head off.
- He likes me.

425
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:55,760
什么情况？30到30的范围之内
- Is it bad?
- 30-30 at close range.

426
00:33:55,837 --> 00:33:57,327
天啊
Jesus!

427
00:33:57,406 --> 00:34:01,035
他怎么了　ＤＯＡ已经把现场封锁了
- Will he make it?
- D.O.A. Blew the bastard wide open.

428
00:34:01,109 --> 00:34:03,134
在汤比利背后有个大洞
Had a hole in his back
you could put your fist into.

429
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:05,372
前面也有个洞
Nice hole in front too.

430
00:34:05,447 --> 00:34:08,848
你看过吗？不　只是听说
- Did you see it?
- No. Heard it.

431
00:34:08,917 --> 00:34:12,409
我们相距很近　我在盯着那鹿
We weren't far apart.
I'd spotted this buck.

432
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:14,819
我又看了看他站的位置
I looked at the bottom
of the cliff where he was standin',

433
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:17,518
然后情况一下子就坏了
and there the fucker was,
deader than shit!

434
00:34:17,592 --> 00:34:19,890
我马上报了警
I called it right in.

435
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:22,020
这只有一个疑点
This is gonna be one mess
to clean up.

436
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,622
伤者的侄子和女儿都去度假了
Twombley's son-in-law and daughter
are up for the weekend.

437
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:28,033
韦德　你看到他们了吗　他们就和我几乎无间擦过
- Didn't you say you'd seen him, Wade?
- Yeah. Damn near ran me over.

438
00:34:28,103 --> 00:34:30,264
你想告诉他们　你认识那老头吗
You want to tell them?
You knew the old man.

439
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:33,796
我他妈哪还有心情说这个
What the fuck!
My day's already ruined.

440
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,036
把钥匙给我　你可以和杰克回去了
Gimme the keys.
You can go back with Jack.

441
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:39,740
你还有事要做　这事还没完结的
- You still got plowing to do.
- It ain't finished,
if that's what you mean.

442
00:34:39,815 --> 00:34:44,218
有人针对你了？是啊　是有这种感觉
- Something bugging you?
- Yeah, a few things.

443
00:34:44,286 --> 00:34:46,413
我们就对这感觉有兴趣
Right now we're not interested
in a few things.

444
00:34:46,488 --> 00:34:50,447
你有时间的话你干嘛不帮我做点事
Why don't you do a few things
for me, and then you get bugged
on your own time?

445
00:34:53,662 --> 00:34:57,257
你每天只是无所事事
You might as well take the rest
of the day off. You look fucked up.

446
00:34:57,332 --> 00:34:59,323
你也收了小费了是吧？
You've been paid
for the day anyhow, right?

447
00:34:59,401 --> 00:35:01,995
还没收他一毛钱　小费更没给
Not exactly.
I mean, he never paid me.

448
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,437
不用担心　你会有工资收的
Don't worry.
You'll get your money.

449
00:35:05,507 --> 00:35:07,873
不要和媒体说这事
Don't talk to any newspaper
about this.

450
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:10,741
汤比利可是有影响力的人
Twombley's
a big deal down in Massachusetts.

451
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:13,178
你只要跟你的律师说　无可奉告
Just tell them that your lawyer
says you shouldn't comment.

452
00:35:13,248 --> 00:35:15,409
律师？我可不需要律师
Lawyer?
I don't need a lawyer, do I?

453
00:35:15,484 --> 00:35:18,180
不，这只是假设　你照做就行了
No, of course not.
Just say it. That's all.

454
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:31,359
汤哥伤了哪里　胸口
- Where'd Twombley get shot?
- In the chest.

455
00:35:31,433 --> 00:35:35,631
不，我想知道详细地点　大概一里左右的路边
- No. I mean whereabouts.
- About a half mile in,
along the old lumber road.

456
00:35:35,704 --> 00:35:39,572
在路边啊　你带他支那去找猎？
The old lumber road, huh? That's a
steep climb. You bring him up yourself?

457
00:35:39,641 --> 00:35:42,303
救护人员也跟着去了那里
Ambulance guys lugged him up.

458
00:35:44,012 --> 00:35:46,776
你走开了？是的
- You stayed away?
- Yeah.

459
00:35:48,683 --> 00:35:51,413
你这血迹从哪来的？什么血迹
- Where'd you get that blood?
- What blood?

460
00:35:51,486 --> 00:35:53,647
你衣服上的
On your sleeve.

461
00:35:53,722 --> 00:35:57,453
可能是...我怎么知道啊
Must've... Ahh.
How do I know?

462
00:35:57,526 --> 00:35:59,687
你在干什么？询问我吗？
What are you doing, playing cop?

463
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:03,595
我只是想弄清楚案发的经过
I gotta make a report to Fish and Game.
I'm just wondering, that's all.

464
00:36:03,665 --> 00:36:07,999
你干了什么？谁知道
- What'd he do?
- Who the fuck knows?

465
00:36:08,069 --> 00:36:10,867
一定是滑倒了
Must've slipped or something.

466
00:36:10,939 --> 00:36:13,499
我只是听到枪响的声音
I just heard the gun go off.

467
00:36:14,576 --> 00:36:17,204
我从来没听过有人中枪的
I've never seen a man get shot before.

468
00:36:17,279 --> 00:36:21,113
甚至是在服兵役的时候　一定有什么事情
Not even in the service.
Must be somethin'.

469
00:36:22,751 --> 00:36:26,312
我真的没有看到　真的？
- I didn't actually see it. Like I said.
- Sure you did.

470
00:36:26,388 --> 00:36:28,913
什么？看到他被枪击了
- What?
- Saw him get shot.

471
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:32,585
你想跟我说什么？我没有看到他被枪击我已经说过了
What the fuck are you telling me?
I never seen the guy get shot.

472
00:36:32,661 --> 00:36:35,596
你一定看到　我知道的
You must've seen him get shot!
I know you did!

473
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:41,268
你他妈的好烦啊　走开吧别再说这风凉话
Let's get the fuck outta here.
You're not making any sense.

474
00:36:43,805 --> 00:36:47,366
多谢你给我的线索
There's your old 20-gauge, and that's
that new Browning you were showing me.

475
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:49,842
噢　看这个
Oh, look at this.

476
00:36:49,911 --> 00:36:52,379
这肯定是汤哥的枪吧
That must be Twombley's gun.

477
00:36:52,447 --> 00:36:55,211
最新型号而且制作精良
It's brand-new.
Very fancy tooling, huh?

478
00:36:55,283 --> 00:36:57,376
可能只开过一次火
Probably only been fired one time.

479
00:36:57,452 --> 00:37:02,822
但鬼知道以后还会有什么事　杰克你说是吧
But what the hell, Jack? I guess you
deserve it. Right's right, huh?

480
00:37:02,891 --> 00:37:05,792
汤哥也不会再开枪了
Twombley sure as hell
won't be shooting it again.

481
00:37:05,861 --> 00:37:09,991
我可得把它改装一下　对，我也有这个打算
- I gotta turn it in to Fish and Game.
- Yeah, I was goin' to.

482
00:37:10,065 --> 00:37:12,124
这当然
Sure, you were.

483
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:22,075
鲁夫　什么事韦德
- Rolfe?
- Yeah, Wade?

484
00:37:22,143 --> 00:37:24,941
兄弟...我打电话来是啊...
Brother, look.
I was calling 'cause...

485
00:37:25,013 --> 00:37:28,278
在波士顿有一起打猎的伤人事件
Has there been anything on TV in Boston
about a hunting accident...

486
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,184
而一个叫汤比利的人是受害者　伊万.汤比利？
involving a guy named Twombley,
Evan Twombley?

487
00:37:32,254 --> 00:37:34,620
人生道路上总有事情发生的
There was something.
It happened up your way.

488
00:37:34,689 --> 00:37:40,491
嗯　我认识他　这孩子跟他一起
Yeah. Yeah, I know him.
I mean, the kid that was with him.

489
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,496
可能你也认识　杰克.休伊特
Maybe you did too.
Jack Hewitt.

490
00:37:42,564 --> 00:37:46,694
他跟我一同在拉利维亚工作　他是我的好友
He works for LaRiviere with me.
He's my best friend.

491
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:49,396
韦德，很晚了　我知道你可能在图比家
Wade, it's late.
I know you're probably at Toby's.

492
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:51,769
但我在床上看书　我们爱好都不同
But I'm in bed reading.
We have different habits.

493
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,504
不　今晚不是　我也是在床上
No, no. Not tonight.
I'm in bed too.

494
00:37:56,578 --> 00:38:00,810
我打电话因为我要你听一下　我想到的这个原理
I was calling 'cause
I need you to listen. I got this theory.

495
00:38:03,518 --> 00:38:06,453
杰克说他洞见汤哥开枪
Jack says he didn't see Twombley shot.

496
00:38:10,325 --> 00:38:15,058
杰克说谎　这事是这孩子做的
It'll come out that Jack lied,
and the kid'll hang for it.

497
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,724
他会给执行调查人员证明的
He was scheduled to testify
for a committee...

498
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:21,428
该会在新英伦的调查组织犯罪　他从事建筑行业
investigating organized crime in
New England, the construction business.

499
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:24,438
谁？汤比利
- Who?
- Twombley.

500
00:38:24,506 --> 00:38:27,270
靠　为什么你认为是杰克开的枪
- No shit!
- Why? Do you think Jack shot him?

501
00:38:27,342 --> 00:38:33,076
嗯　这是个意外　他们是在野外猎鹿是吧？
- Well, it was an accident.
- They were out deer hunting, right?

502
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:38,612
可能有第三者
Maybe there was a third person.

503
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:41,383

Hmm.

504
00:38:41,456 --> 00:38:44,550
莉莲也在　在罗福特
Lillian was here. In Lawford.

505
00:38:45,894 --> 00:38:48,920
在枪击事件前一晚　她现在怎么样
- Night before the shooting.
- How was she?

506
00:38:48,997 --> 00:38:52,455
她来接吉尔
She came to pick up Jill.

507
00:38:52,534 --> 00:38:58,336
她想去度周末　但她想回家
She was supposed to spend
the weekend for Halloween,
but she wanted to go home.

508
00:38:58,406 --> 00:39:00,931
谁？吉尔
- Who?
- Jill.

509
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:08,347
我在想找个律师　也许你可以帮一下忙
I was thinking of getting a lawyer.
Maybe you can help me.

510
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:12,216
有什么事？离婚律师
- What happened?
- A divorce lawyer.

511
00:39:12,287 --> 00:39:15,950
不，监管律师　因为吉尔
No, a custody lawyer.
You know, 'cause of Jill.

512
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:19,118
不要想太多了　你已经筋疲力尽了
Don't think about it.
You're exhausted.

513
00:39:19,194 --> 00:39:21,594
是啊　我想也是
Yeah, I guess so.

514
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:23,756
去睡吧
Get some sleep.

515
00:39:25,934 --> 00:39:30,997
你知道我现在感觉好像只落水狗一样
I get to feeling like
a whipped dog some days.

516
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,667
哪个晚上我会回去咬人的
Some night I'm gonna bite back.
I swear it.

517
00:39:34,743 --> 00:39:37,405
你曾经做过吗？还没
Haven't you already done
a bit of that?

518
00:39:37,479 --> 00:39:40,744
没，没有
No, no, I haven't.
Not really.

519
00:39:40,815 --> 00:39:44,410
我只是有点愤怒
I've growled a little,

520
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:46,647
但是我没有咬人
but I haven't bit.

521
00:40:09,744 --> 00:40:12,144
没事的宝贝
It's okay, sweetie.

522
00:40:14,249 --> 00:40:16,410
你是哪位？
Who are you?

523
00:40:16,484 --> 00:40:20,614
我是韦德　你丈夫在吗？
I'm Wade Whitehouse.
Is your husband here?

524
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:23,851
他在睡觉
He's asleep.

525
00:40:23,925 --> 00:40:27,417
我们昨晚很晚才睡
We were up very late last night.

526
00:40:27,495 --> 00:40:31,829
我来是想向你父亲道歉　汤比利先生
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry
about your father, Mrs. Twombley.

527
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,733
是乔丹女士，谢谢
Mrs. Gordon. Thank you.

528
00:40:34,803 --> 00:40:38,466
是　是啊
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

529
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,976
我有些事情跟乔丹先生谈
I just had a little business
to do with Mr. Gordon.

530
00:40:42,043 --> 00:40:46,571
我是当地警察　我父亲有事吗？
- I'm the local police officer.
- Something about my father?

531
00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:50,140
没有，只是交通问题，不是大问题
No, no, no. It's just a traffic thing.
It's no big deal.

532
00:40:53,221 --> 00:40:55,280
能等吗
Can it wait then?

533
00:40:56,458 --> 00:40:59,222
怀豪斯　下次来先打个电话
Whitehouse, next time,
phone ahead.

534
00:40:59,294 --> 00:41:02,855
乔丹先生　说笑了
Jesus Christ, Mr. Gordon.

535
00:41:02,931 --> 00:41:07,994
我路经这去办事　我不打电话
When I come all the way out here
to serve somebody a summons,
I don't call ahead.

536
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:12,335
你到底想谈什么？
What the hell
are you talking about?

537
00:41:12,407 --> 00:41:15,570
我给你带来了违规交通的罚单
I'm issuing you a ticket.
A moving violation.

538
00:41:15,643 --> 00:41:17,668
违规交通？
Moving violation?

539
00:41:17,745 --> 00:41:20,771
我起床出来，你就跟我说这违规交通罚单？
I just get out of bed,
and you're talking about
a goddamn speeding ticket?

540
00:41:20,849 --> 00:41:25,616
昨天你违规超车..噢等等　
- Yesterday you passed a stopped
school bus which had a flashing...
- Hold on.

541
00:41:25,687 --> 00:41:28,588
不要用手碰我　乔丹先生
Don't ever put your hands on me,
Mr. Gordon.

542
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:31,784
你这个时间来跟我说这该死的交通罚单
You're talkin' about a goddamned ticket
from the time I passed you...

543
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:35,159
而你在梦想做个交通警察
while you were dreaming of
becoming a traffic cop or something.

544
00:41:37,265 --> 00:41:39,495
罚单你收好
There's your ticket.

545
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:43,662
你马上给我滚出去　王八蛋
You get the hell outta
my house now, asshole.

546
00:41:43,738 --> 00:41:46,707
如果我今天不让你被炒就算你走运
You'll be a lucky asshole if I haven't
got you fired by the end of the day.

547
00:41:46,774 --> 00:41:51,143
我说到做到　只要打一个电话就够了　现在我就可以这样做
I could do that. Just one phone call.
I'm pissed enough to do it.

548
00:41:57,085 --> 00:42:00,521
我猜杰克很敏感　
Jack's kind of sensitive, I guess.

549
00:42:00,588 --> 00:42:04,285
听说他昨晚在图比家喝醉了　跟海蒂打架了
Heard he was drunk at Toby's last night
and got in a fight with Hettie.

550
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:06,486
他丢下她开车就走
He drove off without her.

551
00:42:06,561 --> 00:42:11,828
我感到事情不是杰克说的那样
I'm sure. I'm positive it didn't
happen the way Jack says it did.

552
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:16,928
杰克变成了一个永远充满愤怒的人
Jack's turned into one of those men
who are permanently angry.

553
00:42:17,005 --> 00:42:19,701
他以前是个好孩子
He used to be a sweet kid.

554
00:42:19,774 --> 00:42:25,235
当我发现他不能玩球时　他就变了
When he found out he couldn't
play ball anymore, he changed.

555
00:42:25,313 --> 00:42:27,781
他跟一般人一样了
Now he's like everyone else.

556
00:42:27,849 --> 00:42:32,013
我想知道　可能杰克开枪打了汤比利
I've been wondering
if maybe Jack shot Twombley,

557
00:42:32,086 --> 00:42:36,113
而不是汤哥自己躺枪
instead of Twombley
shooting himself.

558
00:42:36,191 --> 00:42:39,558
我想知道杰克是不是故意开枪打他的
I wonder if maybe
Jack shot him on purpose.

559
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:48,493
Wade! How can you even
think such a thing?

560
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,596
韦德　你怎么可以那样想　杰克干嘛要那么做？
Why would Jack Hewitt do that?
Shoot Twombley on purpose?

561
00:42:51,673 --> 00:42:53,607
钱作怪
Money.

562
00:42:53,675 --> 00:42:56,974
杰克不需要钱
- Jack doesn't need money.
- Everybody needs money.

563
00:42:57,045 --> 00:43:01,709
每个人都需要钱　除了汤比利和他的女婿大家都知道
Except Twombley and that son of a bitch
son-in-law of his. People like that.

564
00:43:01,783 --> 00:43:06,345
杰克不会杀他　还有杀他谁给钱他？大把人
- Jack wouldn't kill for it.
Besides, who'd pay him?
- Lots of people.

565
00:43:06,421 --> 00:43:10,755
可能有很多人都想要他死
A guy like Twombley probably got
lots of people who want to see him dead.

566
00:43:10,825 --> 00:43:13,419
政府调查他跟黑手党有关联
The government's investigating
his links to the Mafia.

567
00:43:13,494 --> 00:43:17,089
黑手党雇佣了杰克.赫特？
Oh, the Mafia hired Jack Hewitt?

568
00:43:17,165 --> 00:43:19,998
不..
No, no.

569
00:43:20,068 --> 00:43:24,164
我只知道杰克说谎了
I just know Jack's lying
about how it happened.

570
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:28,073
他看起来很紧张，你知道吗？
He seemed... tight, you know?

571
00:43:28,142 --> 00:43:32,909
我了解他那个人和他的内心　我也曾有他的经历
I know that kid. I know what he's like
inside. He's like me when I was his age.

572
00:43:32,981 --> 00:43:37,782
你没有为钱而杀人
You wouldn't have done anything
like that, shoot somebody for money.

573
00:43:37,852 --> 00:43:40,343
不是为钱
Not for money.

574
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:45,449
如果有人给我一个理由　我就会那样做的知道吗？
But if somebody'd give me half a damned
excuse... I was pretty fucked up.

575
00:43:45,526 --> 00:43:48,290
但你不再是
But you're not anymore.

576
00:43:51,299 --> 00:43:53,460
你什么时候把牙齿修补好
When are you gonna get
that tooth fixed?

577
00:44:01,376 --> 00:44:06,473
噢　我看到你好像个孩子　我孩子时你认识我
- Oh, yeah, I can see
what you looked like as a kid.
- You knew me when I was a kid.

578
00:44:06,547 --> 00:44:11,951
不，现在我知道你是什么样子了　我绝对不会研究你的脸
No, not really. Not what you
looked like. I never studied your face.

579
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:14,113
我从来没有真正..
Hmm. I never really...

580
00:44:14,188 --> 00:44:17,680
从来没有用小孩子的眼光看你
could see you as a kid when
you were a kid until now, this way.

581
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:19,693
怎样看？
In what way?

582
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:22,025
做爱之后
After making love.

583
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:27,056
就看见一个成熟的你
I like it. It's nice to see that
in a grown-up person.

584
00:44:27,135 --> 00:44:29,365
有点惊慌
It's kind of scary.

585
00:44:29,437 --> 00:44:31,997
但是很美好　嗯
- But it's nice.
- Yeah.

586
00:44:32,073 --> 00:44:34,803
我去从拿啤酒　好的
- I'll get us a beer.
- Okay.

587
00:44:36,611 --> 00:44:39,671
难道你不认为..
Don't you think...

588
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:42,875
你真认为这个好主意吗？
Do you really think
it's a good idea to press...

589
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:46,010
现在托管这个事情
this custody thing right now?

590
00:44:46,087 --> 00:44:48,419
是的　怕什么
Sure. Why not?

591
00:44:49,957 --> 00:44:53,393
我不知道　我只是好像....
I don't know.
It's just... Seems like...

592
00:44:57,031 --> 00:45:00,467
我是她父亲　有心无力
I'm her father.
Supposed to be, but I'm not able to.

593
00:45:01,703 --> 00:45:04,604
是　我要这么做
Yeah. Yes, I do.

594
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:08,870
知道吗　可能我一生中唯一的事情
You know, maybe the only thing
in my life...

595
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:12,310
我当然想过
that I've been
so sure about wanting.

596
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,009
即使要作很大的斗争
Even if it takes a big fight.

597
00:45:16,084 --> 00:45:19,110
好吧　我想你肯定要那么做
Well, then I guess you have to.

598
00:45:19,187 --> 00:45:22,122
我还在考虑另一个件事
There's another thing
I've been thinking about.

599
00:45:22,190 --> 00:45:26,991
我不知道你对这主意的看法　可能我人从来没谈论过
I don't know how you feel
about the idea, 'cause
we've never talked about it.

600
00:45:27,061 --> 00:45:29,757
但我考虑过...
But I've been thinking...

601
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:34,495
我考虑我们应该结婚　过我们的二人世界
I've been thinking we should
get married sometime. You and me.

602
00:45:34,569 --> 00:45:40,201
噢韦德　只是想　只是个想法
- Oh, Wade.
- It's just... It's just
a thought, that's all.

603
00:45:40,274 --> 00:45:44,005
你已经结过两婚了　是啊但都跟同一个女人
- You've been married twice.
- Yeah, but it was to the same woman.

604
00:45:44,078 --> 00:45:46,444
我只是个小孩子
I was just a kid.

605
00:45:46,514 --> 00:45:50,644
没有结婚证书　也不喜欢求婚那些东西
It's not like
a marriage proposal or anything.

606
00:45:50,718 --> 00:45:53,380
只是想一个主意
It's just a thought, an idea.

607
00:45:53,454 --> 00:45:57,322
考虑人们的事情　想想啊你知道的
Something for you and me
to think about, you know.

608
00:45:59,127 --> 00:46:03,029
好吧　我考虑一下　好
- All right. I'll think about it.
- Good.

609
00:46:07,335 --> 00:46:10,702
我有个儿子　该死
I've got sons, goddamn it!

610
00:46:10,772 --> 00:46:15,038
我的天　我有个儿子
My God, have I got sons!

611
00:46:15,109 --> 00:46:19,136
韦德　鲁夫
Wade? Rolfe?

612
00:46:19,213 --> 00:46:21,613
依邦妮
Elbourne?

613
00:46:21,682 --> 00:46:24,048
你们爱我吗？
You love me, boys?

614
00:46:24,118 --> 00:46:27,019
你们爱你的父亲吗
You love your Pop?

615
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:31,925
当然喜欢
Of course you do.

616
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:36,054
格林　不要这样
Glen, come on, please.

617
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:39,361
噢　莎莉
Oh, Christ, Sally!

618
00:46:39,434 --> 00:46:43,029
你是个好人
You are such a good person.

619
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:45,038

Capital "G."

620
00:46:45,106 --> 00:46:50,066
你是..你比我还好人
By God, you are...
You are so much better than I am.

621
00:46:50,144 --> 00:46:53,580
我不再是好人了
I who am no goddamn good at all.

622
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,184
而你
And you,

623
00:46:58,252 --> 00:47:01,346
你才是真正的好人
you are a truly good person...

624
00:47:01,422 --> 00:47:04,323
好像是个圣人
like a fucking saint!

625
00:47:04,392 --> 00:47:06,917
该死的比较
Fucking beyond compare!

626
00:47:06,994 --> 00:47:09,827
格林　不要　滚开
- Glen, don't. Come on.
- Get away!

627
00:47:11,999 --> 00:47:15,594
噢　看我的大儿子来了
Whoa! My, my,
look at my big boy here,

628
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:18,070
看来要打我是吧　你这小混蛋
bursting out of the seams
of his jeans.

629
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:22,576
你少在这叽歪　格林　不要
- You little prick!
- Glen, don't!

630
00:47:30,051 --> 00:47:33,282
嗯　好了....
Yeah, well...

631
00:47:33,354 --> 00:47:36,755
你有告诉他们我们要来吗
Did you tell them that we were coming?

632
00:47:36,824 --> 00:47:40,225
难道你觉得要介绍认识一下父母　这么做不合适？
Don't you think it's proper for a fella
to introduce his girl to his parents?

633
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:42,262
我知道你的父母
I know your parents.

634
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:46,858
我得去领我拉离婚文件　律师那边不会花多长时间
I just gotta pick up my divorce papers
for the lawyer. It won't take long.

635
00:47:46,934 --> 00:47:49,664
你真的会做争夺监护权这件事
You're really gonna do that?
That custody thing?

636
00:47:49,737 --> 00:47:52,638
是的　噢天啊
- Yeah!
- Oh, God.

637
00:47:52,707 --> 00:47:57,269
我想你要抱歉　你希望不再变
I think you'll be sorry. I think you'll
wish you'd never opened this up again.

638
00:47:57,345 --> 00:48:00,837
韦德　可能吧　但如果我放过我会更加遗憾
Maybe. But I'd be a hell
of a lot sorrier if I just let it go.

639
00:48:00,915 --> 00:48:03,042
孩子大得快
Kids grow up fast
and then it's over.

640
00:48:03,117 --> 00:48:07,679
你变老了，孩子就变得陌生了　看我和我那老头
You get old, your kids are strangers.
Look at me and my old man.

641
00:48:07,755 --> 00:48:11,282
你父亲不喜欢你　那才是你们成陌生人的原因
Your father's not like you.
That's why you and he are strangers.

642
00:48:12,527 --> 00:48:14,859
那是我的见解
That's my whole point.

643
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:16,624

I don't want to get into that.

644
00:48:16,697 --> 00:48:19,928
莉莲不喜欢你母亲
And Lillian's not like your mother.
She won't roll over.

645
00:48:20,001 --> 00:48:22,526
她打你不痛心的
She'll fight you like a she-bear.

646
00:48:22,603 --> 00:48:27,472
如果莉莲像我妈妈那样　我就不必这样做了
If Lillian had been like my mother,
I wouldn't have to be doing any of this.

647
00:48:59,674 --> 00:49:00,538
你肯定他们在这里
Are you sure they're home?

648
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:03,475
车还在
Well, the truck's still here.

649
00:49:03,544 --> 00:49:06,945
看来下雪后他们就没出来
Looks like they stayed inside
since the snowfall.

650
00:49:11,252 --> 00:49:13,686
奇怪了
That's strange.

651
00:49:13,754 --> 00:49:15,915
你认为他们没事吧
You think they're all right?

652
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:18,220
当然　我听说过他
Yeah, of course.
I would've heard.

653
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:21,227
怎样？我不知道
- How?
- I don't know, for chrissake!

654
00:49:30,671 --> 00:49:33,435
爸
Pop?

655
00:49:33,507 --> 00:49:35,975
爸　你还好吧
Hey, Pop, you okay?

656
00:49:36,043 --> 00:49:37,977
啊
Huh?

657
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:41,915
哦
Oh.

658
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:04,160
老天　爸　天那么冷你怎么可以穿成那样
Jesus, Pop, how can you stand the cold,
dressed like that?

659
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:06,206
哦
Huh? Oh.

660
00:50:07,408 --> 00:50:09,672
妈在哪？
Where's Ma?

661
00:50:09,744 --> 00:50:13,236
哦，她睡了
Ah, she's sleeping.

662
00:50:14,815 --> 00:50:16,749
噢
Oh.

663
00:50:18,285 --> 00:50:20,913
你还记得玛格.福格吗？
You remember Margie Fogg?

664
00:50:22,456 --> 00:50:24,788
哦　来自维汉的吗？
Oh. From Wickham's?

665
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:26,554
您好　维候斯先生
Hello, Mr. Whitehouse.

666
00:50:26,627 --> 00:50:30,586
你要来杯咖啡吗？
Ah. You, ah, like
some coffee or something?

667
00:50:30,665 --> 00:50:33,657
不用了谢谢
No, thanks.

668
00:50:33,734 --> 00:50:35,964
你和妈妈好吗？我在镇上没见到你
How are you and Ma doing?
I haven't seen you in town.

669
00:50:36,037 --> 00:50:39,837
我们都很好
We're all right.
Yeah, we're all right.

670
00:50:39,907 --> 00:50:43,707
她睡了　你们要我去叫醒她吗？
Uh, she's sleeping.
You want me to go up and get her?

671
00:50:43,778 --> 00:50:46,042
要
- Yeah.
- Oh.

672
00:50:51,752 --> 00:50:54,050
这里根本没什么改变
Jesus. Nothing's
changed around here.

673
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:57,579
这里很冷啊　我去点火炉
- It's freezing in here.
- Yeah, yeah. I'll put some wood on.

674
00:50:57,658 --> 00:50:59,922
关上门能好点
Close the door would help.

675
00:51:01,095 --> 00:51:03,290
不要，对你不好
Don't. It's bad for you.

676
00:51:09,937 --> 00:51:13,896
可能他们老了不能住在这里了　可能吧
- Maybe they're too old
to be staying here.
- Maybe so.

677
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,942
妈在哪
Where's Mom?

678
00:51:20,014 --> 00:51:22,448
她出来了
Ah, she's comin'.

679
00:51:22,516 --> 00:51:26,247
你有暖热房子吗
Have you been heating
the house? Not just with the stove.

680
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,845
这里有炉子
Well, there's a furnace here.

681
00:51:28,923 --> 00:51:33,553
你们今天不用吗？
- You're not using it today?
- Well, I...

682
00:51:33,627 --> 00:51:35,686
坏了　不能用了
It's broken or something.

683
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:39,859
在睡房里有电子暖炉
There's an electric
up in the bedroom.

684
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:44,234
可能韦德要去检查一下　管道可能会冻住了
Maybe Wade oughta take a look at it.
Your pipes will freeze.

685
00:51:44,305 --> 00:51:47,138
你去看吗？可以
- Would you do that, Wade?
- Yeah, yeah.

686
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:57,550
啊
Ah...

687
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,889
妈
Ma?

688
00:52:16,837 --> 00:52:18,930
妈
Ma?

689
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:29,911
嘿　妈
Hey, Ma.

690
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:33,943
妈　快醒醒
Ma, come on, wake up.

691
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:41,456
噢　老天
Oh, Jesus.

692
00:52:41,529 --> 00:52:44,396
噢
Oh, Lord.

693
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:46,433
噢　老天
Oh, Jesus.

694
00:52:55,075 --> 00:52:57,566
韦德
Wade?

695
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:10,723
这
Is, uh...

696
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:17,159
她死了吗？
She's dead then?

697
00:53:17,231 --> 00:53:18,664
是
Yep.

698
00:53:18,732 --> 00:53:21,166
她什么时候死的？
When did she die?

699
00:53:23,003 --> 00:53:25,494
我检查过她
I checked on her.

700
00:53:25,573 --> 00:53:28,872
我买了电子暖炉
I brought the electric up.

701
00:53:28,943 --> 00:53:32,640
寒冷天气困扰着她
The cold bothers her
more than it does me.

702
00:53:32,713 --> 00:53:36,274
所以我就买了台电子暖炉
That's why I brought
the electric up and...

703
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:40,047
难道你们没有电话？在大厅
- Don't you have a telephone?
- It's in the living room.

704
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,521
为什么你不打电话叫修理暖气
Why didn't you call
and have the furnace fixed?

705
00:53:43,591 --> 00:53:47,994
韦德　我想她没事
Oh, Wade.
I thought she was all right.

706
00:53:49,797 --> 00:53:54,962
到早上..
Till this morning, she was.

707
00:53:55,035 --> 00:53:57,060
这太我很伤心
It makes me sad!

708
00:53:57,137 --> 00:53:59,537
我可以做什么？
Is there anything I can do?

709
00:53:59,607 --> 00:54:02,371
她让我比死难受　
Makes me sad it was her
instead of me.

710
00:54:02,443 --> 00:54:04,934
天
God!

711
00:54:05,012 --> 00:54:07,503
Oh.

712
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,854
我应该冻死的
I should've froze.

713
00:54:30,137 --> 00:54:32,935
韦德给我电话都在深夜
Wade called me, as usual, late at night.

714
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:37,103
我知道是韦德　没人会在那个时候给我打电话
I knew it was Wade.
No one else calls me at that hour.

715
00:54:37,177 --> 00:54:42,114
我又准备听他另一个传奇故事
And I was ready to listen to another
chapter in one of his ongoing sagas.

716
00:54:42,182 --> 00:54:45,515
这是一个传奇故事　伊万.汤比利枪击事件
There was the detective story concerning
the shooting of Evan Twombley,

717
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:50,250
还有关于韦德和莉莲的争斗的情节
and the family melodrama
about Wade's custody fight with Lillian.

718
00:54:50,324 --> 00:54:52,315
但这次不同
But not this time.

719
00:54:52,393 --> 00:54:55,920
韦德说不同的故事都是差不多
Wade was telling
a different story, or so it seemed then,

720
00:54:55,996 --> 00:54:58,590
一个是我自己的角色
one in which I myself was a character.

721
00:54:58,666 --> 00:55:01,499
他给我电话就前一晚　
He had called to tell me
that some time the previous night...

722
00:55:01,568 --> 00:55:04,264
他发现我们的母亲死了
he had discovered
our mother had died,

723
00:55:04,338 --> 00:55:09,435
他和玛格去探望我们的父亲的时候　却发现她的尸体
and he'd discovered the body
when he went over to visit her
and our father with Margie Fogg.

724
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:13,776
叫我通知我们的妹妹和她的丈夫凯特
It was left to me to tell
our sister Lena and her husband Clyde...

725
00:55:13,847 --> 00:55:17,749
他超重　要上天做他们的救世者
who'd gone overweight and
made Jesus Christ their personal Savior.

726
00:55:21,522 --> 00:55:24,320
爸的身体还好　但老了
Pop was okay, but out of it.

727
00:55:24,391 --> 00:55:28,794
比平常更差　他比平常少喝酒了
Worse than usual, maybe,
though no drunker than usual.

728
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:38,097
你怎样　鲁夫？你得救了
How 'bout you, Rolfe? Are you saved?

729
00:55:38,172 --> 00:55:41,699
不　我没有
No, I'm not.

730
00:55:41,775 --> 00:55:44,039
那么　你会入地狱
But then you'll be in hell.

731
00:55:44,111 --> 00:55:46,477
我想会的
I guess I will.

732
00:55:46,547 --> 00:55:50,039
我和妈　韦德和爸
Me and Mom and Wade and Pop.

733
00:55:50,117 --> 00:55:52,051
我们都在一起
We'll all be there together.

734
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:54,144
我们不应上路吗？
Shouldn't we get this show on the road?

735
00:55:56,557 --> 00:56:00,493
到教堂没有意义，多此一举
Well, pointless to stand around
in church, I guess, with nothing to do.

736
00:56:00,561 --> 00:56:04,053
吉尔怎么样了？莉莲带她吗？
What about Jill?
Is Lillian bringing her?

737
00:56:04,131 --> 00:56:06,622
他们会在教堂和墓园
They'll be at the church
and the cemetery.

738
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:10,500
有人再想要啤酒吗？鲁夫？
Anyone else want another beer?
Rolfe?

739
00:56:10,571 --> 00:56:12,766
不了谢谢　我不会喝酒
No, thanks.
I don't drink.

740
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:17,439
是的我忘记了，对不起
Yeah, I forgot. Sorry.

741
00:56:19,847 --> 00:56:22,577
你怎么样？韦德
How are you holding up, Wade?

742
00:56:22,649 --> 00:56:25,516
我很好
Oh, I'm fine.

743
00:56:25,586 --> 00:56:28,111
你是鲁夫？是的
- Are you Rolfe?
- Yes.

744
00:56:28,188 --> 00:56:32,181
我是乔丹　在高中时我记得你
Gordon. Gordon LaRiviere.
I remember you from high school.

745
00:56:32,259 --> 00:56:34,489
你现在都老师吗？
You're a teacher now? Hmm?

746
00:56:34,561 --> 00:56:37,155
哈佛大学？
- Harvard?
- B.U.

747
00:56:37,231 --> 00:56:39,825
我没看见你
Oh. I don't see you around.

748
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:43,165
我不想你为这个原因而来
I don't suppose there's much reason
for you to come this way.

749
00:56:45,372 --> 00:56:48,705
来吧　爸爸
- Come on, Pop.
- Hmm?

750
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:53,309

- Join us.
- Huh?

751
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:55,439
牧师
Reverend?

752
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:58,679
在进行仪式前我们要祈祷
Let's kneel for a moment of prayer
before the service.

753
00:56:58,752 --> 00:57:01,949
韦德　鲁夫
Wade? Rolfe?

754
00:57:04,391 --> 00:57:07,849
真是发神经　韦德
- This is nuts.
- Wade.

755
00:57:12,166 --> 00:57:14,100
耶稣在天堂
- Jesus in heaven,
- Oh!

756
00:57:14,168 --> 00:57:18,036
我们跪在你的面前　恳求你的原谅
We come to Thee on our knees,
begging for Thy forgiveness.

757
00:57:18,105 --> 00:57:22,269
感谢你廉价求助礼物
And thanking Thee for
the undeserved gift of Thy salvation.

758
00:57:22,342 --> 00:57:26,438
我们感谢你令我们可以活在世上
We thank Thee, whose blood
was shed that we may live.

759
00:57:26,513 --> 00:57:28,504
赞美上帝..
- Praise the Lord!
- Praise the Lord.

760
00:57:28,582 --> 00:57:33,884
你们不必为个死女人祈祷
Oh, God, not one of you
is worth a single hair
on that woman's head! God!

761
00:57:33,954 --> 00:57:37,788
请照顾这位女人　我们的母亲和朋友
Please look down upon this woman,
our mother and friend,

762
00:57:37,858 --> 00:57:40,156
要她作我们的榜样
and make her example
known to us.

763
00:57:40,227 --> 00:57:45,164
你们不要为这个死女人祈祷
Not one of you is worth a goddamned hair
on that good woman's head!

764
00:57:45,232 --> 00:57:48,292
爸　这算是什么？
- Pop!
- Jesus! What is this shit?

765
00:57:48,368 --> 00:57:51,929
我到教堂去　这是艰难的时刻
- I'll head on to the church.
- This is a difficult time.

766
00:57:52,005 --> 00:57:57,466
爸　没什么大不了的　告诉我没什么大不了
- Pop, it's no big deal.
- Oh, smart guy.
Tell me it's no big deal?

767
00:57:57,544 --> 00:58:00,411
我只是...告诉我
I just... Tell me...

768
00:58:00,481 --> 00:58:05,316
你们中那个值得为那女人祈祷
there's a single one of you
that's worth one single hair
on that woman's gray head!

769
00:58:05,385 --> 00:58:07,353
爸爸　什么？
- Pop?
- What?

770
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:09,651
耶稣比任何恶魔更有力量
Jesus is more powerful
than any demon.

771
00:58:09,723 --> 00:58:14,422
你自己搞鬼吧　韦德　由他去吧
- Oh, go fuck yourself!
- Wade, just leave it.

772
00:58:14,495 --> 00:58:18,591
听听你的弟弟的吧
Yeah, just listen
to your little brother here.

773
00:58:18,665 --> 00:58:22,192
韦德　由他去吧
"Wade, just leave it."

774
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:25,568
王八蛋　
Candy-asses.

775
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:28,199
全都是
All of you.

776
00:58:28,275 --> 00:58:31,836
那是我给孩子们的
That's what I've got for children.

777
00:58:31,912 --> 00:58:35,245
耶稣怪物和王八蛋们
Jesus freaks and candy-asses!

778
00:58:35,315 --> 00:58:39,445
噢　由他去吧　韦德
Oh. "Just leave it, Wade.

779
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,513
赞美上帝　由他去吧　韦德
Praise the Lord!
Just leave it, Wade."

780
00:58:43,590 --> 00:58:46,423
住口　格林.维候斯　该死
- Stop, Glen Whitehouse!
- Goddamn it! Come on, girl!

781
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:54,129
如果你再碰她　我就宰了你
If you ever touch her again,
I'll kill you! I swear it!

782
00:58:56,336 --> 00:59:00,295
你还是维护你的弟弟
You're still standing up
for your little brother, huh?

783
00:59:04,211 --> 00:59:07,942
上帝的恩典....
For as much as it hath pleased
Almighty God of His great mercy...

784
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:11,680
葬礼当天下着大雪
It snowed the day of the funeral.

785
00:59:11,752 --> 00:59:14,687
在加拿大下了一个星期雪了
The snow line had descended
from Canada weeks before...

786
00:59:14,755 --> 00:59:16,985
现在向南移到罗福特
and was now well south of Lawford,

787
00:59:17,057 --> 00:59:21,517
慢慢移到新汉普郡　一直到马萨诸塞
creeping across New Hampshire
towards Massachusetts.

788
00:59:21,595 --> 00:59:25,361
真心希望能复活　通过我们上帝和耶稣的力量
In sure and certain hope
of the Resurrection to enteral life,

789
00:59:25,432 --> 00:59:27,866
尘归尘　土归土　阿门
through our Lord Jesus Christ.

790
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:33,034

Earth to earth, ashes to ashes,

791
00:59:33,106 --> 00:59:35,040

dust to dust.

792
00:59:35,108 --> 00:59:37,042

Amen.

793
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:42,913
爸　我们回屋里去
Pop, let's go back to the house.

794
00:59:49,923 --> 00:59:52,448
嗨　爸爸
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

795
01:00:01,268 --> 01:00:03,168
很高兴你能来
I'm glad you came.

796
01:00:03,237 --> 01:00:05,569
能陪我一会吗？
Can you stay for a while?

797
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:07,573
不
No.

798
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:19,741
你曾去过你父亲的坟墓吗？
You ever go to
your father's grave anymore?

799
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:22,186
没有，再没去过了
No, not anymore.

800
01:00:22,256 --> 01:00:24,554
太远了
It's too far.

801
01:00:28,662 --> 01:00:30,596
我们要谈谈
We should talk.

802
01:00:30,664 --> 01:00:33,462
我们已经谈过了　只是...
- We've done all our talking, Wade.
- It's just that...

803
01:00:33,533 --> 01:00:35,899
不，不要再说了
No, please don't.

804
01:00:39,940 --> 01:00:42,408
你妈妈的事　我很难过
I'm sorry about your mother.

805
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:45,468
我真的喜欢她
I really liked her.

806
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:50,447
你不会懂女人蒙受多少痛苦
You never know how much
women like that suffer.

807
01:00:50,517 --> 01:00:55,887
她们默默无闻过她们的生活
Like they live their whole lives
with the sound turned off.

808
01:00:55,956 --> 01:00:57,890
然后默默无闻的消失
Then they're gone.

809
01:01:04,531 --> 01:01:07,227
妈妈　嗯？
- Mom?
- Huh?

810
01:01:07,301 --> 01:01:11,362
她四点要上滑冰课　爸　我学溜冰了
- She's got an ice skating
lesson at 4:00.
- I'm taking ice skating, Dad.

811
01:01:11,438 --> 01:01:14,134
很好啊
That's great.

812
01:01:14,207 --> 01:01:17,699
花样滑冰　冰上芭蕾
- Figure skating, I suppose.
- And ice ballet.

813
01:01:17,778 --> 01:01:19,712
很好
That's great.

814
01:01:26,887 --> 01:01:28,821
嗯
Well...

815
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:32,218
再见爸爸
Good-bye, Dad.

816
01:01:57,351 --> 01:02:00,548
玛格怎么样了？她怎样了？
- What about Margie?
- What about her?

817
01:02:00,620 --> 01:02:03,282
你还计划结婚吗？
You still plan on
getting married?

818
01:02:03,357 --> 01:02:07,953
是的　她可能辞掉工作搬过来和爸爸一起生活
Oh, yeah. She'll probably quit her job
and move out here with Pop.

819
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,996
我们不能留下他孤ど活
We can't leave him alone anymore.

820
01:02:10,063 --> 01:02:12,964
不然他可能把房子都烧掉
He'll probably set
the damn place on fire.

821
01:02:13,033 --> 01:02:16,764
玛格能带吉尔来真好
And with Jill here a lot,
it'll be good to have Margie around.

822
01:02:18,839 --> 01:02:22,240
顺便　要改变一下房子的环境
Things are gonna change
in that department, by the way.

823
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:25,403
我有个律师在康坷　我明天去见他
I got a custody lawyer down in Concord.
I'm gonna see him tomorrow.

824
01:02:25,479 --> 01:02:29,939
去那边受一下罪，但也值得　把铲放在一边
All hell's gonna break loose, but it'll
be worth it. Here, put the shovels away.

825
01:02:37,924 --> 01:02:41,917
我想用完这些汽油
I wanna let it run out of gas.

826
01:02:41,995 --> 01:02:44,429
我不想那老头子醉驾
I don't want the bastard drivin' drunk.

827
01:02:44,498 --> 01:02:46,864
他时常都是醉酒
He's drunk all the time now.

828
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,902
我们要把车钥匙藏起来
After, we'll hide the keys.

829
01:02:49,970 --> 01:02:52,370
枪击事件有新进展吗？汤比利
Anything new about
the shooting? Twombley?

830
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:56,000
没有　我想只是大家所想的意外
No. I guess it was an accident
like everybody thinks.

831
01:02:56,076 --> 01:02:58,636
想要听听我的想法吗？
Want to know what
I think happened?

832
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:01,374
到处都找到这些东西
You find them everywhere.

833
01:03:01,448 --> 01:03:04,884
我想你对枪击的第一反应是对的
I think your first response
to the shooting was the correct one.

834
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:19,732
是什么？那不是意外
- Which is?
- That it wasn't an accident.

835
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,768
那是谁开的枪？
Well, then who shot him?

836
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:24,429
你的朋友，杰克.赫特
Your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.

837
01:03:24,504 --> 01:03:26,438
杰克
Jack.

838
01:03:26,506 --> 01:03:29,066
少来，鲁夫，他有什么动机
Come on, Rolfe.
Give me a motive.

839
01:03:29,142 --> 01:03:31,906
钱　钱？谁来给他钱
- Money.
- Money? Who'd pay 'im
that kind of money?

840
01:03:31,978 --> 01:03:35,311
不是黑帮，他们有自己的人动手，都是职业杀手
Not the mob.
They got their own guys. Specialists.

841
01:03:35,382 --> 01:03:40,012
汤比利豁然死了，谁会从中得益
Who else benefits
if Twombley is suddenly dead?

842
01:03:42,889 --> 01:03:46,086
我不知道，你来告诉我吧
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Okay.

843
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:51,358
有人不想汤比利去作证
It's likely there are people
in the union who don't want
Twombley to testify.

844
01:03:51,431 --> 01:03:54,491
可能包括他的女婿，副总裁
That probably includes his son-in-law,
who's vice president,

845
01:03:54,568 --> 01:03:57,093
可能是下一任的总裁
and will probably be
the next president.

846
01:03:57,170 --> 01:04:00,333
我在报纸上看到的　他叫什么名字了　美乔丹？
- I read that in the papers.
Uh, what's his name?
- Mel Gordon.

847
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:03,103
梅尔.乔丹　那家伙开宝马车对吧？
- Mel Gordon, right.
- The guy in the B.M.W., right?

848
01:04:03,176 --> 01:04:05,701
是的　我的道理是
Okay, here's my theory.

849
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:08,976
汤比利他不知道非法借贷
Twombley, he doesn't know
about illegal loans or whatever,

850
01:04:09,049 --> 01:04:13,543
后来调查后他才知道
and he starts to nose around because
of the investigation, and he finds out.

851
01:04:13,620 --> 01:04:16,885
才发现牵涉到他的女婿
Finds out his son-in-law is involved.

852
01:04:16,957 --> 01:04:20,518
所以　梅尔.乔丹不想自己动手
So Mel Gordon wouldn't want
a professional hit.

853
01:04:20,594 --> 01:04:24,325
所以他设下陷阱　做成是意外一样　
That makes the Feds dig deeper.
He wants it to look like an accident.

854
01:04:24,397 --> 01:04:26,922
打猎意外
A hunting accident's perfect.

855
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:29,798
你在树林里射杀人　
Around here,
you shoot somebody in the woods,

856
01:04:29,870 --> 01:04:34,603
你说是意外　他们罚你五十块　吊销你的打猎证了事
you say it was an accident,
they fine you 50 bucks and
they lift your hunting license.

857
01:04:34,674 --> 01:04:36,642
杰克　他....
And Jack, he...

858
01:04:38,912 --> 01:04:42,279
杰克因为他没打到鹿　
Jack's probably sayin' the guy shot
himself 'cause he ain't got his deer,

859
01:04:42,349 --> 01:04:46,308
他不想善罢甘休
and he don't want
his license lifted.

860
01:04:46,386 --> 01:04:50,220
不，事情太简单了　事情就这么简单
Nah. That's too neat.
Things ain't that neat.

861
01:04:50,290 --> 01:04:54,727
有些事　只会书上有
- Some things are.
- Only in books.

862
01:04:54,794 --> 01:04:56,728
事情已经发生了
It's what happened.

863
01:05:01,601 --> 01:05:03,592
这会让我发疯的
That makes me mad.

864
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:08,063
有人被他的女婿枪杀
That somebody can shoot somebody,
his own father-in-law,

865
01:05:08,141 --> 01:05:10,075
而凶手却逍遥法外
and not be punished for it.

866
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,771
你不觉得很不公平吗？不觉得有什么很特别
- Don't that piss you off?
- No, not particularly.

867
01:05:12,846 --> 01:05:16,213
天啊，难道你不关心什么叫正义
Right's right, goddamn it. Jesus, Rolfe.
Don't you care about what's right?

868
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:18,751
我只关心事实真相
I care about what happened.

869
01:05:18,818 --> 01:05:21,616
事件的真相
The truth.

870
01:05:21,688 --> 01:05:26,921
记得我是学历史的
Remember, I'm a student
of history. Books.

871
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:39,905
我考虑过你说的故事
I've been thinkin' about
that story you told me...

872
01:05:39,973 --> 01:05:41,941
关于爸爸的...
about Pop...

873
01:05:42,008 --> 01:05:46,001
在冰地上砍木材
and chopping the firewood
out of the ice and after.

874
01:05:50,183 --> 01:05:54,620
我不想令你失望　但我不想那个事发生
I don't want to disappoint you,
but I don't think it happened.

875
01:05:54,688 --> 01:05:58,021
你认为我不记得那件事了吗？不是我
- You don't think I'd remember
a thing like that?
- It wasn't me.

876
01:05:58,091 --> 01:06:02,152
我不在那里　我只是听说这件事　
I wasn't there.
When I heard about it, it was Elbourne.

877
01:06:02,228 --> 01:06:05,288
我们得要去越南问他了
Elbourne, Jesus. We'd have
to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.

878
01:06:05,365 --> 01:06:08,960
依邦尼和妈带你去看医生
And Elbourne and Mom
brought you to the doctor...

879
01:06:09,035 --> 01:06:12,698
告诉他　你从草堆上掉下来
and told him
you fell from the hayloft.

880
01:06:12,772 --> 01:06:16,037
我从没听过
I never heard that one.

881
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:21,045
不　我清楚记得
No, I remember clearly because...

882
01:06:21,114 --> 01:06:27,019
因为我听了之后　我变得真的关心爸爸了
after I heard, I became
real careful around Pop.

883
01:06:27,087 --> 01:06:30,056
我是个细心的孩子
I was a careful child...

884
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:33,354
我变成一个细心的成年人
and I became a careful adult.

885
01:06:33,426 --> 01:06:37,362
但起码我不会被男人的暴力折磨
But at least I was never afflicted
by that man's violence.

886
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:47,369
这就是你的想法
That's what you think.

887
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,912

Ahh!

888
01:06:55,982 --> 01:06:59,145
我还是回去吧　路途遥远　
I better head back.
It's a long drive.

889
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:01,153
好吧
All right.

890
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:03,155
好
Okay.

891
01:07:08,895 --> 01:07:11,022
好了吗？吉米
Ready, Jimmy?

892
01:07:11,097 --> 01:07:13,065
不要抽烟
Put out that cigarette!

893
01:07:15,068 --> 01:07:17,866
不要在这里
Not there, asshole. Strip it.

894
01:07:19,406 --> 01:07:21,499
早上好乔丹　早上好韦德
- Morning, Gordon.
- Morning, Wade.

895
01:07:21,574 --> 01:07:23,667
嗨　杰克
Hey, Jack.

896
01:07:23,743 --> 01:07:26,405
我他妈的要离开这里　怎么了罗福特
- I'm fuckin' out of here.
- What, Lawford?

897
01:07:26,479 --> 01:07:28,709
不干这工作了
Out of this fucking job.
This job sucks.

898
01:07:28,782 --> 01:07:31,273
冬天在外地工作
Workin' outside
in the winter sucks.

899
01:07:31,351 --> 01:07:35,082
开车门吗？干嘛你不辞职
- Open the door, will you?
- Why don't you quit now,
you want out so bad?

900
01:07:35,155 --> 01:07:38,352
开门吧　我们迟到的　不不　杰克我说真的
- Open the door. We're late.
- No, I mean it, Jack.

901
01:07:38,425 --> 01:07:42,327
你现在有很有钱　要到加州去冲浪吧
You got enough money now.
Head out to California. Surf's up, Jack.

902
01:07:42,395 --> 01:07:46,889
你在冰雪中挖个坑　你说我有钱是什么意思
- And you digging wells in the snow.
- What do you mean I got money?

903
01:07:46,966 --> 01:07:51,903
我跟你一样是穷光蛋　和开玩笑的杰克
- I'm as broke as you.
- Looney Tunes, Jack.
Fucking Looney Tunes.

904
01:08:00,213 --> 01:08:02,647
你认为可以把钱带走吗？
You think you're getting away with it?

905
01:08:27,907 --> 01:08:29,932
乔丹先生
Mr. Gordon!

906
01:08:30,009 --> 01:08:32,500
老板在里面吗？在的
- Is the boss in?
- Yes, indeedy.

907
01:09:01,341 --> 01:09:03,832
我离婚了
I screwed up the divorce.

908
01:09:05,478 --> 01:09:09,312
我答应她的任何要求
I agreed to everything
that she said.

909
01:09:09,382 --> 01:09:12,215
我只是想她喜欢我
I just wanted her to like me.

910
01:09:12,285 --> 01:09:14,981
我想做个好父亲
I wanted to be a good father.

911
01:09:16,523 --> 01:09:19,549
我有份文件
I have the documents.

912
01:09:19,626 --> 01:09:22,288
你知道吗
You know,

913
01:09:22,362 --> 01:09:26,230
如果你结婚后　你工作的时候家里有个人，对你很有帮助
It would help if you were married,
if there was someone at home
while you're at work.

914
01:09:26,299 --> 01:09:29,564
我很快计划好
I plan to soon.

915
01:09:29,636 --> 01:09:31,831
多快？
How soon?

916
01:09:31,905 --> 01:09:35,136
下个春天　
- Next spring.
- It would help...

917
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:38,177
环境上有些改变是会有所帮助
if there was some change in circumstance
since this was drawn,

918
01:09:38,244 --> 01:09:44,046
如果你的前妻有吸毒　酗酒　
if there was some drug or alcohol abuse
on the part of your ex-wife.

919
01:09:44,117 --> 01:09:47,109
性问题会影响你的孩子　不好意思
Sexual problems upsetting the child.
I'm sorry!

920
01:09:47,187 --> 01:09:51,954
这些事我一定要解释清楚　我们要讨论这份文件
But these are the things
we're gonna have to explore
if we want to contest this document.

921
01:09:54,828 --> 01:09:59,162
一定要那么乱吗？绝对要
- Does it have to get that messy?
- Absolutely.

922
01:09:59,232 --> 01:10:02,133
这只是冰山一角　维候斯先生
This is just the tip of the iceberg,
Mr. Whitehouse.

923
01:10:02,202 --> 01:10:05,968
我希望你明白我说的意思
I hope you understand
what I'm saying.

924
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,303
看来没什么希望是吗？
Looks kind of hopeless, don't it?

925
01:10:08,374 --> 01:10:11,673
不　我要看看离婚法令
No, not really. I'll have
another look at the divorce decree,

926
01:10:11,744 --> 01:10:14,508
看是否我们可以改正
see if we can get it redrawn.

927
01:10:14,581 --> 01:10:18,108
但是有几点我要采访你的女儿
But at some point, I'm going
to have to interview your daughter.

928
01:10:18,184 --> 01:10:21,620
叫吉尔是吧？是的
- It's Jill, right?
- Yes.

929
01:10:21,688 --> 01:10:23,622
你有烟灰缸吗？
You got an ashtray?

930
01:10:29,495 --> 01:10:32,953
我需要五百块
I'll need a $500 retainer.

931
01:10:33,032 --> 01:10:35,159
你可以寄给我
You can just mail it to me.

932
01:10:37,237 --> 01:10:41,003
全部费用需要多少钱？很难说
- How much is the whole thing
gonna cost?
- It's hard to say.

933
01:10:41,074 --> 01:10:44,908
但如果我们要监护权　就要有存款　精神心理评估
But if we go for custody, there's
depositions, psychiatric evaluations.

934
01:10:44,978 --> 01:10:48,675
但若只想有权去探视
But if we just want to get
the visitation rights redrawn,

935
01:10:48,748 --> 01:10:54,118
他们限制　不超过三千五百块
assuming they're unduly restrictive,
it wouldn't be more than $3,500.

936
01:10:54,187 --> 01:10:56,678
Oh.

937
01:10:56,756 --> 01:11:02,058
最大利益必须要经济来支持
It might be in your best interest
legally as well as financially
to just go for...

938
01:11:02,128 --> 01:11:06,258
我知道　监护权的事情不只是我要回她
I know. The custody thing wasn't
just my trying to get back at her.

939
01:11:06,332 --> 01:11:09,392
我也不是那么笨
I'm not as dumb as I look.

940
01:11:09,469 --> 01:11:12,563
我没说你笨
I didn't say you
looked dumb, Mr. Whitehouse.

941
01:11:15,675 --> 01:11:18,838
我爱我的女儿　我会给你五百块
I love my daughter.
I'll send you the $500.

942
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:26,084
不好意思，午餐吃了太久
I'm sorry about the long lunch.

943
01:11:26,152 --> 01:11:28,120
我的车又坏了
My transmission's going out again.

944
01:11:28,187 --> 01:11:31,645
你有想过拥有部新车吗
Did you ever think about
getting a new car?

945
01:11:31,724 --> 01:11:34,124
你会约我钱吗
On what you pay me?

946
01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:39,292
艾林　打电话给美尼特　要他来送韦德的车去修理
Elaine, call Chub Merritt, have him pick
up Wade's shitbox, fix the transmission.

947
01:11:39,365 --> 01:11:41,299
什么
What?

948
01:11:41,367 --> 01:11:46,361
打电话给美尼特　要他来送韦德的车去修理
Call Chub Merritt, have him pick up
Wade's car, fix the transmission.

949
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:48,873
我支付修理费用
I'll bill the repair
to the town.

950
01:11:50,176 --> 01:11:54,272
你可以用我的车
You can use my four-by-four.

951
01:11:54,347 --> 01:11:56,281
你是警察
You're the town police officer.

952
01:11:56,349 --> 01:11:59,477
镇上的警察该有部好车
The town police officer
should have a decent car.

953
01:12:01,087 --> 01:12:03,954
你是否想要辆新车
Well, you want a new car or not?

954
01:12:04,023 --> 01:12:06,992
我要做什么？不用
- What do I have to do for it?
- Nothing.

955
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:09,358
韦德　我考虑过了
You know, Wade,
I've been thinking.

956
01:12:09,429 --> 01:12:12,330
你在附近还不够受欢迎
You don't get enough
appreciation around here.

957
01:12:12,398 --> 01:12:17,028
我早上看见梅尔.乔丹来这里　怎样？
- Uh-uh. I saw Mel Gordon
in here this morning.
- So?

958
01:12:17,103 --> 01:12:21,767
他说了我要给他传票的事吗？那家伙不接受
He say anything about
that summons I tried to give him?
Son of a bitch wouldn't accept it.

959
01:12:21,841 --> 01:12:23,809
韦德　那家伙不够聪明
- Wade, "dat" wasn't smart.
- "That?"

960
01:12:23,876 --> 01:12:26,936
在他岳父打死自己之后出来
Going out right after
the man's father-in-law shot himself.

961
01:12:27,013 --> 01:12:30,676

It's pronounced "that,"
not "dat." That.

962
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:33,548

- That.
- Yeah.

963
01:12:33,619 --> 01:12:36,918
不要说这个了　帮我个忙
Let it go.
Call it a favor to me.

964
01:12:36,990 --> 01:12:38,924
你？为什么　
You? Why?

965
01:12:38,992 --> 01:12:41,517
梅尔和我做生意
Well, Mel's doing
some business with me.

966
01:12:41,594 --> 01:12:44,119
你做的事为人民服务
It's nice to do a favor for people
you do business with.

967
01:12:44,197 --> 01:12:46,131
他要赶时间，没什么大不了的
He was in a hurry.
It's no big deal.

968
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:51,034
汤比利被枪杀前他知道了　有什么不同
- That was before Twombley
was shot, before he knew.
- What's the difference?

969
01:12:51,104 --> 01:12:55,632
开我的车　去休息一下　不用担心梅尔.乔丹
Take my truck, take a rest.
Stop worrying about Mel Gordon.

970
01:13:00,580 --> 01:13:03,447
你决定要怎么处理你爸住的地方了吗？
Have you decided what to do
with your old man's place yet?

971
01:13:03,516 --> 01:13:05,916
你要卖掉它　搬进城里
You oughta sell it,
move into town.

972
01:13:05,985 --> 01:13:08,715
你想买吗？不要在这里抽烟
- You wanna buy?
- Don't light that here. I'm allergic.

973
01:13:08,788 --> 01:13:11,018
我不想　你感兴趣吗　可能吧
- I won't. You interested?
- Maybe.

974
01:13:11,090 --> 01:13:13,251
你和梅尔.乔丹？可能
- You and Mel Gordon?
- Could be.

975
01:13:13,326 --> 01:13:17,023
总是打韦德的主意　你在说什么
- Always count on Wade
for a good screwing, huh?
- What are you talking about?

976
01:13:17,096 --> 01:13:20,827
为什么你们赚这些钱　你和梅尔和杰克
Why should you guys make all the money?
You, Mel and Jack.

977
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:25,837
是吧　我说过不要在这抽烟
- Right's right.
- I asked you not to light
that fucking thing in here.

978
01:13:25,905 --> 01:13:29,898
要抽出去抽
Get out of here
with that smoke!

979
01:15:22,121 --> 01:15:26,490
绝妙打猎意外事故
A hunting accident's perfect.

980
01:15:26,559 --> 01:15:28,720
枪击事件有进展吗
Anything new
about the shooting?

981
01:15:28,794 --> 01:15:30,819
我想你对事件第一反应是对的
I think your first response
to the shooting was the correct one.

982
01:15:30,897 --> 01:15:33,422
你的朋友　杰克赫特
Your friend, I think. Jack Hewitt.
He's my favorite.

983
01:15:33,499 --> 01:15:36,900
钱　打猎意外　我想不是意外
Money. Hunting accident.
I bet it wasn't an accident.

984
01:15:36,969 --> 01:15:39,631
不是我　我不在　真相...
It wasn't me. I wasn't there.
- The truth.

985
01:15:39,705 --> 01:15:43,266
记住事情发生跟你说的不一样　
Remember, it may have happened,
but not the way you said.

986
01:15:43,342 --> 01:15:47,005
太完美就是有漏洞
It's what happened
not because it's neat.

987
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:55,680
汤比利突然死亡就是谋杀
Twombley's sudden death.
Killing was the correct one.

988
01:15:55,755 --> 01:15:57,689
真相　记住..
The truth, remember.

989
01:16:25,451 --> 01:16:30,081
你疯了　差点要了我们俩的命
You crazy son of a bitch!
You almost killed us both!

990
01:16:30,156 --> 01:16:32,317
你快滚
Get off the fuckin' ice!

991
01:16:32,391 --> 01:16:34,518
滚
Get off!

992
01:16:38,764 --> 01:16:40,732
你们去干嘛　杰克
What're you runnin' from, Jack?

993
01:16:42,435 --> 01:16:44,369
我们要谈谈
We're gonna talk.

994
01:16:52,378 --> 01:16:55,575
退后　不然我会开枪的
Stay back. I'll shoot you.

995
01:16:55,648 --> 01:16:59,414
如果你不跑进车里　我就杀了你
I'll fuckin' shoot you dead
if you don't get back in that truck.

996
01:16:59,485 --> 01:17:02,579
你不会开枪的　放下枪
You ain't shootin' shit.
Now put the gun away.

997
01:17:02,655 --> 01:17:04,520
告诉我怎么回事
Tell me what happened.

998
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:09,027
别动　你再动开枪打死你
Don't move!
I'll shoot you dead if you move.

999
01:18:31,477 --> 01:18:33,570

Thanks a lot.

1000
01:18:46,158 --> 01:18:48,092
住手
Stop that!

1001
01:18:48,160 --> 01:18:51,186
谁？我？我什么都没做啊
Who? Me?
I didn't do nothin'.

1002
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:56,833
看我的杰作
Just look what a good job I done here.

1003
01:18:56,902 --> 01:19:00,167
你什么都没做　我应该把你留在家里
You haven't done anything. I should've
left you at home to stew in your drink.

1004
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:02,173
让你喝醉　你应该这样
Damn right you should have.

1005
01:19:03,909 --> 01:19:05,843
时间问题
It's about time.

1006
01:19:05,911 --> 01:19:08,471
你父亲来了　玛格要照顾他
Your father's here.
Marge got to baby-sit him.

1007
01:19:08,547 --> 01:19:10,811
她跟你搬进来？
She moved in with you, huh?

1008
01:19:10,883 --> 01:19:14,341

- What happened?
- Don't even ask.

1009
01:19:14,420 --> 01:19:16,980
浪子
My, my, my.
The prodigal son.

1010
01:19:17,056 --> 01:19:18,990
倒霉
About fuckin' time too.

1011
01:19:19,058 --> 01:19:21,856
我有份新工作　后勤工作　洗碗
I got me a new job.
Second cook and bottle washer.

1012
01:19:21,927 --> 01:19:24,293
爸爸　我们回家吧
Pop, for chrissake,
let's go home.

1013
01:19:24,363 --> 01:19:26,456
对不起　我的车开不动了
I'm sorry. I got waylaid.

1014
01:19:29,602 --> 01:19:31,729
你的车开不动
The hell you got waylaid.

1015
01:19:31,804 --> 01:19:35,467
看你冻成这样　老天
You follow your prick around
like it was your nose, for chrissake!

1016
01:19:35,541 --> 01:19:38,476
带他走
Can it, Whitehouse.
Get him out of here.

1017
01:19:38,544 --> 01:19:41,672
之前有趣　但我累了　我们回家
- It was funny at first, but I'm tired.
- Let's go home.

1018
01:19:41,747 --> 01:19:46,275
是哪个家？你家还是我家
What home is that?
Is that your home or my home?

1019
01:19:46,352 --> 01:19:49,810
你他妈这么狡猾，韦德
You're a fuckin' sly, Wade.

1020
01:19:49,889 --> 01:19:53,825
你妈死了　她再也不能给你找借口了
Now, your mom's dead. She can't
make any excuses for you anymore.

1021
01:19:53,893 --> 01:19:59,195
你要好好对我　
You've got to deal with me now.
No more sugar tit, sonny!

1022
01:19:59,265 --> 01:20:02,962
我们回家吧　不要再吵了
- For chrissake, Pop. Let's go home.
- Don't give me any of your lip.

1023
01:20:03,035 --> 01:20:05,560
快离开这里　我不能
- Get out of this fast.
- I can't.

1024
01:20:05,638 --> 01:20:07,572
你要推我吗？
Are you pushing me?

1025
01:20:11,143 --> 01:20:15,204
不要再推我
- Come on. My God.
- Don't push me!

1026
01:20:15,281 --> 01:20:18,580
你认为你能管我吗　快点吧
- You think you can take me now?
Just come on.
- Come on.

1027
01:20:18,651 --> 01:20:21,745
上车　有什么问题
- Just get in the car.
- What's the matter?

1028
01:20:21,821 --> 01:20:24,381
上车
Just get in the car.

1029
01:20:24,457 --> 01:20:27,688
上车　懦夫
- Get in. Just get in.
- Wimp!

1030
01:20:27,760 --> 01:20:30,490
为什么你长不大呢
Why don't you grow up?

1031
01:20:30,563 --> 01:20:32,997
你永远不活不了自己
You never could stand up
for yourself!

1032
01:20:33,065 --> 01:20:35,090
该死的
Goddamn it!

1033
01:20:35,167 --> 01:20:40,104
你一点都不明白　我希望你去死
- You could never understand
what it's about.
- I wish you'd die!

1034
01:20:40,172 --> 01:20:43,630
噢　住手
Oh, stop it!
Just stop it! Stop it!

1035
01:21:20,212 --> 01:21:23,181
鲁夫　我要看见你在镜子里面　
No shit, Rolfe.
I glanced up and there he was,

1036
01:21:23,249 --> 01:21:25,843
镜子里面却只看到我
only it was me.

1037
01:21:25,918 --> 01:21:29,012
好像我从来没见过自己
But it was like
I had never seen myself before.

1038
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,524
一张陌生的面孔　很难解释
It was a stranger's face.
It's hard to explain.

1039
01:21:32,591 --> 01:21:38,393
你坐飞机飞走了　就像我坐了一夜
You fly on automatic pilot, like I was
doing all night, and you disappear.

1040
01:21:38,464 --> 01:21:42,798
然后看见你的身体　或是你的脸
Then you accidentally see your body,
or your face, or whatever,

1041
01:21:42,868 --> 01:21:46,929
你不知道它属于谁
and you don't know
who in the hell it belongs to.

1042
01:21:47,006 --> 01:21:49,133
很陌生　
Strange.

1043
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:53,907
我知道是和我爸爸有关　我知道我和他都很生气
It's the business with the old man,
I know, and how incredibly
pissed I was at him,

1044
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:58,939
追捕杰克赫特　那该死的车　还有玛格的不安
and chasing Jack Hewitt
and the goddamned truck,
not to mention Margie's being upset.

1045
01:21:59,018 --> 01:22:02,078
一波未平一波又起
One thing on top of another.

1046
01:22:02,154 --> 01:22:04,554
韦德　你没事吧
Wade, are you all right?

1047
01:22:04,623 --> 01:22:07,319
你要听着　你不会相信
You gotta hear this.
You won't believe it.

1048
01:22:07,393 --> 01:22:10,692
梅尔乔丹去拜访拉利维亚
Mel Gordon had come by
to visit LaRiviere.

1049
01:22:10,763 --> 01:22:13,231
他们在办公室里
So they're in the office.

1050
01:22:13,299 --> 01:22:16,826
梅尔乔丹认识到我已知道
Mel Gordon realized
that I was onto them.

1051
01:22:16,902 --> 01:22:19,496
梅尔想他可以收买我
Mel thinks he can buy me off.

1052
01:22:19,572 --> 01:22:22,666
但拉利维亚他知道不行
But LaRiviere,
he knew that wouldn't work.

1053
01:22:22,741 --> 01:22:26,700
梅尔乔丹能够收买拉利维亚
Mel Gordon may be able
to buy off LaRiviere. That's one thing.

1054
01:22:26,779 --> 01:22:29,111
但我不行
But not me.

1055
01:22:29,181 --> 01:22:34,517
杰克赫特怎么能搞到如此糟糕
How could a guy like Jack Hewitt
get into a mess like this?

1056
01:22:52,071 --> 01:22:54,767
咖啡　谢谢艾尔
- Coffee?
- Thank you, Alma.

1057
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:58,298
你要加糖或牛奶吗　不　斋啡的就行
- You want milk and sugar?
- No, no. Black is fine.

1058
01:22:58,377 --> 01:23:01,073
我喜欢喝这样的
I like it this way.

1059
01:23:01,146 --> 01:23:03,637
你买了台新电脑是吗
You got yourself
a new computer, huh?

1060
01:23:03,716 --> 01:23:06,651
我把我的文件都存进去
I've been putting
all my files into it.

1061
01:23:11,190 --> 01:23:13,215
你还好吧　韦德
You all right, Wade?

1062
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:17,626
我有颗烂牙　疼死我了
Yeah. I got this damn tooth.
It's killing me.

1063
01:23:19,598 --> 01:23:23,625
有些事情烦我　跟别人一样
Got a few things bugging me,
just like everybody else.

1064
01:23:23,702 --> 01:23:25,636
我没事
I'm okay.

1065
01:23:25,704 --> 01:23:28,332
我不是想多嘴
I don't mean to pry.

1066
01:23:29,908 --> 01:23:33,503
你妈的死我很遗憾　但是葬礼办得很好
I'm sorry about your mother.
It was a nice funeral.

1067
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:36,905
事情已经过去了
It's over now.

1068
01:23:38,384 --> 01:23:40,716
艾尔
Alma,

1069
01:23:40,786 --> 01:23:44,586
我觉得这个镇上有些肮脏的事情
I think there's some dirty business
goin' on in this town.

1070
01:23:44,657 --> 01:23:46,852
我知道　总会有一些的
I know that.
There always has been.

1071
01:23:46,925 --> 01:23:51,760
不　这事比以往还要毒辣
No, no. I think this is a little worse
than you and I are used to.

1072
01:23:51,830 --> 01:23:56,199
我要谈的是谋杀案件
I'm talkin' about murder,
among other things.

1073
01:23:56,268 --> 01:23:59,260
谁？汤比利
- Who?
- Twombley. Evan Twombley.

1074
01:23:59,338 --> 01:24:01,363
联合公司老板被枪杀
The union boss official
who got shot.

1075
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:03,840
有人谋杀了他　谁？
- Somebody murdered him.
- Who would...

1076
01:24:06,311 --> 01:24:10,577
你认识杰克赫特　和我一起工作的那个年轻人
You know Jack Hewitt,
the kid I work with?

1077
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:14,244
我想是杰克杀了他
Well, I think Jack shot him.

1078
01:24:14,319 --> 01:24:18,551
你知道汤比利是梅尔乔丹的岳父
You know, Twombley was
the father-in-law of Mel Gordon.

1079
01:24:18,624 --> 01:24:20,854
拉利维亚的朋友
That's a friend of LaRiviere's.

1080
01:24:20,926 --> 01:24:23,861
还不清楚是什么关系
I don't know what
the connection is yet,

1081
01:24:23,929 --> 01:24:26,830
但拉利维亚要杰克带他去打猎
but LaRiviere had Jack
take him out hunting,

1082
01:24:26,899 --> 01:24:29,197
假装成意外
pretending it was an accident.

1083
01:24:31,537 --> 01:24:36,133
杰克说出真相　他可以无罪的
If Jack told the truth, he could
be free by the time he's my age.

1084
01:24:37,776 --> 01:24:40,210
有些事情比你想象的更简单
Sometimes things
are simpler than you think.

1085
01:24:40,279 --> 01:24:43,715
让我问你一个问题　你不相信我吗
- Let me ask you a question.
- You don't believe me?

1086
01:24:43,782 --> 01:24:46,910
关于杰克的事　不
About Jack? No.

1087
01:24:46,985 --> 01:24:50,853
你最近检查过你父亲农场的税单吗？
Have you checked out the tax bill
on your father's farm lately?

1088
01:24:54,293 --> 01:24:58,320
我知道他欠了两年了
Um, I know he's been due
for a couple of years.

1089
01:24:58,397 --> 01:25:02,333
如果有了保险金　我想把单给付了
I was thinkin' of paying it
when the insurance comes in.

1090
01:25:02,401 --> 01:25:05,165
有人愿意买吗？
Has anybody offered to buy it?

1091
01:25:05,237 --> 01:25:07,899
有　事实上是拉利维亚
Yeah. Matter of fact, LaRiviere.

1092
01:25:12,144 --> 01:25:15,841
这里都是去年全镇的地产交易
These are all
the real estate transactions
in this town for the last year.

1093
01:25:15,914 --> 01:25:21,318
大多数是无用土地　大多数都是小雇主
Most of it is unused land. Most of it is
for little more than back taxes owed.

1094
01:25:21,386 --> 01:25:23,377
莉莲怎么样了？
How's Lillian?

1095
01:25:23,455 --> 01:25:26,117
她很好
She's fine.

1096
01:25:26,191 --> 01:25:28,250
这是三年内的　
That's three years ago.

1097
01:25:28,327 --> 01:25:30,261
很不同是吗？
It's quite a difference, hmm?

1098
01:25:30,329 --> 01:25:33,765
北部发展协会是什么
What's the North Country
Development Association?

1099
01:25:33,832 --> 01:25:36,300
我检查过
Went down to Concord.
I checked it out.

1100
01:25:36,368 --> 01:25:38,302
梅尔乔丹是总裁
Mel Gordon is the president.

1101
01:25:38,370 --> 01:25:41,828
副总裁是乔丹拉利维亚
And the vice president
and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere.

1102
01:25:41,907 --> 01:25:47,573
他们去年买下全部山头　花了三十六万四千美元
They're buying up the whole mountain.
$364,000 last year.

1103
01:25:47,646 --> 01:25:51,639
我相信那是拉利维亚的一小部分
I believe that's a little
outside of LaRiviere's league.

1104
01:25:51,717 --> 01:25:54,151
汤比利有牵涉吗　没有
- Is Twombley involved?
- No.

1105
01:25:57,322 --> 01:25:59,256
Hmm.

1106
01:26:00,793 --> 01:26:02,727
他一定是发现了
He must've found out.

1107
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:07,730
他们一定是要除掉他
They had to get rid of him.

1108
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:11,497
杰克该受指责
And Jack...
Jack will get blamed for it.

1109
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:13,765
所有这些数据显示
All these figures show is that...

1110
01:26:13,839 --> 01:26:18,276
乔丹拉利维亚很快就会很富有　因为他是镇长
Gordon LaRiviere is gonna be a very rich
man because of his being a selectman.

1111
01:26:18,343 --> 01:26:22,439
一两年内　你是很难了解这个镇的
In a year or two,
you're not gonna recognize this town.

1112
01:26:22,514 --> 01:26:25,642
噢　天啊
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

1113
01:26:42,568 --> 01:26:45,002
你们这些杂种　我有你的资料
You sneaky son of a bitch!
I got your number now!

1114
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:49,234
这些年来我以为你是个正人君子　我很感激你
All these years
I thought you were a decent man.
Ran around feeling grateful to you.

1115
01:26:49,308 --> 01:26:51,708
你相信吗　非常感激你
Can you believe that? Grateful!

1116
01:26:51,777 --> 01:26:54,405
好了你被炒了　他是利用我们
- You're fired!
- He's using us.

1117
01:26:54,479 --> 01:26:57,812
要我们做他的奴隶　你在做什么
- We're his slaves. We're alike.
- What were you doing with my truck?

1118
01:26:57,883 --> 01:27:02,911
你是懦夫吗　你完蛋了　把钥匙给我
- Are you a quitter? Quitter!
- You're finished. Gimme the keys.

1119
01:27:02,988 --> 01:27:05,115
我给你　我不受你管
I give it with pleasure.
I'm free of you.

1120
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:08,785
我不会再回来这　你会看到是什么样了　不要碰我
- You're not on my back anymore.
You see how easy it is?
- Keep your hands off me.

1121
01:27:08,861 --> 01:27:14,493
我会处理　住手
I'll handle this.
Break it up. Break it up, Wade!

1122
01:27:14,566 --> 01:27:17,558
住手　韦德
Break it up! Wade!

1123
01:27:17,636 --> 01:27:21,265
我要修理你
You ain't gettin' away with this!
You ain't gettin' away with it!

1124
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:24,969

Stay out of it, Jimmy. You're fired.
I want the shop keys. Where are they?

1125
01:27:25,043 --> 01:27:28,570
放开　走开
Wade, get out of here! Just go!

1126
01:27:28,647 --> 01:27:30,615
我打个电话给我弟弟
I gotta call my brother.

1127
01:27:37,522 --> 01:27:41,458
我知道那意思　我用尽我的方法
Yeah, I know what it means.
I'm just runnin' out of ways to use it.

1128
01:27:41,526 --> 01:27:44,393
为什么？为什么要帮助杰克
- Why? For what?
- To help Jack.

1129
01:27:44,463 --> 01:27:47,398
要将那群杂种绳之于法　两个乔丹
To nail those sons of bitches.
You know, the two Gordons.

1130
01:27:47,466 --> 01:27:51,402
艾玛就会那样叫他们的　鲁夫你支持谁
That's what Alma calls them.
Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?

1131
01:27:51,470 --> 01:27:55,566
韦德　首先你小事要谨慎
Wade, listen.
Take care of the little things first,

1132
01:27:55,641 --> 01:27:59,077
那对你留意大事有帮助　
the things that are distracting you
from taking care of the big things.

1133
01:27:59,144 --> 01:28:01,578
打电话给美尼特　要回你的车
Call Chub Merritt,
get your car back.

1134
01:28:01,647 --> 01:28:04,582
打电话给牙医　拔掉烂牙
Call a dentist
and get your tooth pulled.

1135
01:28:04,650 --> 01:28:06,675
忘掉打猎意外不要管了
Forget about the hunting accident.

1136
01:28:06,752 --> 01:28:09,050
马上走
Let it go.

1137
01:28:12,357 --> 01:28:14,382
韦德
Wade?

1138
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:19,021
好消息是我们还没有修好你的车
- Chick.
- The good news is,
we haven't got to your car yet.

1139
01:28:19,097 --> 01:28:22,032
那坏消息呢　告诉我什么时候修好
- The bad news...
- Just tell me when you have it fixed.

1140
01:28:22,100 --> 01:28:26,196
坏消息是乔丹的车有问题　昨晚有人开枪了
The bad news is there's a problem with
Gordon's truck, which somebody shot up.

1141
01:28:26,271 --> 01:28:30,332
估计像知道的　嗯我知道
- Figured you'd know
something about that, Wade.
- Yeah, I know about that.

1142
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:33,207
拉利维亚说他不会支付你的修车费用
LaRiviere says he ain't gonna pay
for fixing your car.

1143
01:28:33,278 --> 01:28:35,542
要花两百块
It's a couple hundred
for the transmission.

1144
01:28:35,614 --> 01:28:38,310
还有更多坏消息　想听吗
I got more bad news.
Wanna hear it?

1145
01:28:38,383 --> 01:28:40,715
好，说吧　听说你被炒了
- Yeah, tell me.
- Chub says you're fired.

1146
01:28:40,786 --> 01:28:43,687
他无权炒我　拉利维亚早上已经做了
He can't fire me.
LaRiviere already did that this morning.

1147
01:28:43,755 --> 01:28:45,689
你在镇上的其它工作
Your other job for the town.

1148
01:28:45,757 --> 01:28:50,456
说把你的警章收了，清理出警队
Chub's a selectman. Said to turn
your badge in and clean out your office.

1149
01:28:54,566 --> 01:28:57,694
你这是什么意思　我告诉你....
What do you mean you can't
take me today? I told you it's...

1150
01:28:57,769 --> 01:29:00,932
靠...
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1151
01:29:01,006 --> 01:29:03,031
韦德　什么
- Wade?
- What?

1152
01:29:03,108 --> 01:29:06,100
你究竟发生什么事了？
What in the world
is happening to you?

1153
01:29:06,178 --> 01:29:11,115
为什么你行为这么古怪　我的牙很疼
- Why are you acting this way?
- It's my tooth! It's my goddamn tooth!

1154
01:29:11,183 --> 01:29:13,811
脑袋也疼死了
I can't even think anymore
because of it.

1155
01:29:13,885 --> 01:29:18,015
你早上被炒了是吗
You got fired this morning,
didn't ya?

1156
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:20,923
玛格　相信我那是暂时的　
Margie, look.
That's temporary, believe me.

1157
01:29:20,993 --> 01:29:24,190
过几天会朋消息
There's so much shit that's gonna
hit the fan in the next few days,

1158
01:29:24,262 --> 01:29:27,561
我被拉利维亚炒了
and my getting fired by LaRiviere
and Merritt won't matter a bit.

1159
01:29:34,973 --> 01:29:37,874
我会找其它的工作
I'll get another job.

1160
01:29:37,943 --> 01:29:40,434
毕竟有人需要我
People are gonna need me.
After this is over,

1161
01:29:40,512 --> 01:29:42,605
他们要把我当作英雄
they're gonna make me
into a goddamn hero!

1162
01:29:42,681 --> 01:29:47,584
你们等着看吧　我会做个最好的父亲
You wait, you'll see. I'll deliver.
I'll be the best father that ever lived.

1163
01:29:47,652 --> 01:29:51,213
你需要我　甚至是爸爸都需要我
You need me. Even Pop!
For chrissake, he needs me!

1164
01:29:51,289 --> 01:29:53,814
这个镇也需要我
This town needs me!

1165
01:29:53,892 --> 01:29:56,690
我另找份工作　可能马上..
I'll get another job.
Maybe right now...

1166
01:29:56,762 --> 01:30:00,596
他们认为我会去咆哮像只狗一样
they think they can send me howling
into the corner like a kicked dog!

1167
01:30:00,665 --> 01:30:03,566
但我的天　很快就不同了
But by God,
it'll be different soon!

1168
01:30:05,771 --> 01:30:09,172
还是没有改
Always been a whiner. God!

1169
01:30:09,241 --> 01:30:14,702
现在我这个老头子是个真正的男人了
Now, my old man, there was...
There was a real man.

1170
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,715
没有女人能令他团团转
He let no woman push him around.

1171
01:30:19,217 --> 01:30:21,651
到死还要工作
Worked till the day he died.

1172
01:30:23,922 --> 01:30:28,256
像他这样的男人才是真正的男人
Yeah, men like him
were real men.

1173
01:30:29,861 --> 01:30:33,797
而女人知道有没有困惑自己的位置
And women knew their place.
There was no confusion.

1174
01:30:35,700 --> 01:30:38,999
女人尊重男人　不像现在...
Women respected men then.
It wasn't like it is today...

1175
01:30:39,071 --> 01:30:41,198
小心你说的话　格林
Be careful what you say,
Glen Whitehouse.

1176
01:30:41,273 --> 01:30:45,733
我了解你　我母亲认识你妻子
I know you.
My mother knew your wife.

1177
01:30:45,811 --> 01:30:48,041

Oh, what she went through.

1178
01:30:48,113 --> 01:30:50,775
该死的
Don't you sass me, damn it!

1179
01:30:52,484 --> 01:30:54,748
你认为你是个大人物？
You think you're
pretty hot stuff, huh?

1180
01:30:54,820 --> 01:30:57,254
你也会变老的
Well, you're gettin' old too.

1181
01:30:57,322 --> 01:31:01,452
没有女人能阻止变老
And there's not a goddamn thing
a woman can do about that.

1182
01:31:03,061 --> 01:31:05,222
有吗
Is there?

1183
01:31:20,412 --> 01:31:23,472
把瓶子给我
Gimme the bottle.

1184
01:31:23,548 --> 01:31:25,982
好的
Sure.

1185
01:32:27,979 --> 01:32:29,913
你会说　我应该知道
You will say that I should've known...

1186
01:32:29,981 --> 01:32:32,415
有可怕的事要发生
terrible things
were about to happen.

1187
01:32:32,484 --> 01:32:35,282
你会说我有责任
You will say
that I was responsible.

1188
01:32:35,353 --> 01:32:40,017
我到时能做什么
But even so, what could
I have done by then?

1189
01:32:40,091 --> 01:32:43,618
韦德生活在他感情的边缘
Wade lived on the edge
of his emotions.

1190
01:32:43,695 --> 01:32:47,563
他总是第一个失道接受父亲的怒气
He was always first to receive
the brunt of our father's anger.

1191
01:32:47,632 --> 01:32:50,465
他没有观点去对抗
He had no perspective
to retreat to,

1192
01:32:50,535 --> 01:32:52,867
即使在危机时
even in a crisis.

1193
01:33:44,489 --> 01:33:46,480
等等　她快出来了
Wait there.
She'll be right out.

1194
01:33:46,558 --> 01:33:48,924
我想我们该去农场见见我父亲
I thought we'd go
out to the farm, see my dad.

1195
01:33:48,994 --> 01:33:52,054
穿靴子　嗨亲爱的
- Get your boots.
- Hi, honey.

1196
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:55,657
明晚六点送她回来　没有问题
- Have her home tomorrow night by 6:00.
- That's no problem.

1197
01:33:55,734 --> 01:34:00,137
莉莲对不起　我把痛牙给拔了
Lillian, I'm sorry. I had
this damn tooth, and I got it pulled.

1198
01:34:00,205 --> 01:34:02,730
你真让我恶心　什么？
- God, you make me sick.
- What?

1199
01:34:02,807 --> 01:34:05,298
我真不敢相信你这么颓废
I can't believe
you would sink this low.

1200
01:34:05,377 --> 01:34:08,835
颓废什么　我做了什么　你的律师打电话来了
- Low as what? What have I done?
- Your lawyer called.

1201
01:34:08,913 --> 01:34:11,882
来看自己女儿都是坏事吗
Yeah. Is that bad to want
to see your own daughter?

1202
01:34:11,950 --> 01:34:13,884
不要装傻了
Don't play dumb.

1203
01:34:13,952 --> 01:34:18,651
你知道我在说什么　你说你很爱女儿的
For what this will do to her,
this kid you say you love so much.

1204
01:34:18,723 --> 01:34:21,590
是爱吗　韦德
Love, Wade?

1205
01:34:21,660 --> 01:34:25,426
真的吗？真丢脸
Really? Shame on you!

1206
01:34:25,497 --> 01:34:27,431
你真丢脸
Shame on you.

1207
01:34:27,499 --> 01:34:32,527
再见亲爱的　有空晚上给我电话
- Bye, sweetie. Call me tonight
if you feel like it.

1208
01:34:32,604 --> 01:34:34,902
我们就这样走吗？
Are we going in this?

1209
01:34:34,973 --> 01:34:37,737
是　我的车在商店那
Yeah, my car's in the shop.
This'll be fine.

1210
01:34:37,809 --> 01:34:40,778
车很旧了　是爸爸的
- It's pretty old.
- It belongs to Pop.

1211
01:34:43,248 --> 01:34:46,115
爸爸？我爸爸　你的爷爷
- Pop?
- Yeah, my father. You know who he is.

1212
01:34:46,184 --> 01:34:48,675

Pop. It's his.

1213
01:34:48,753 --> 01:34:50,687

Yeah.

1214
01:34:54,326 --> 01:34:56,988
去吃快餐怎么样
Well, how 'bout a Big Mac?

1215
01:34:57,062 --> 01:35:01,294
妈妈不让我吃快餐　你知道对身体不好
Mom won't let me eat fast food.
You know that. It's bad for you.

1216
01:35:01,366 --> 01:35:06,770
不会的　我们经常去吃快餐　就像以前一样
Come on. We can always sneak
a Big Mac like we used to.

1217
01:35:06,838 --> 01:35:11,468
你最喜欢吃的草莓糕　怎么样　吉尔
- And a cherry turnover.
What do you say, Jillie?
- No.

1218
01:35:11,543 --> 01:35:14,103
那你想吃什么？什么也不想吃
- What do you want then?
- Nothing.

1219
01:35:14,179 --> 01:35:16,841
不能不吃东西啊　我们去吃午餐
Come on, you can't have nothing.
We gotta have lunch.

1220
01:35:16,915 --> 01:35:19,349
比萨好吗？跟快餐一样
- Mr. Pizzeria?
- Same thing, Dad.

1221
01:35:19,417 --> 01:35:24,582
妈妈说那些东西不适合你吃　我不在乎妈妈说什么
- Mom says all that food is bad for you.
- I don't care what Mom says.

1222
01:35:24,656 --> 01:35:26,715
今天我作主　好吗？
I'm in charge today, okay?

1223
01:35:26,791 --> 01:35:31,524
好吧　你想吃什么都行　你想吃什么？
Okay. We'll get what you want.
What do you want?

1224
01:35:31,596 --> 01:35:35,726
我想吃什么？我不知道
What do I want?
Well, I don't know.

1225
01:35:35,800 --> 01:35:39,327
我想等到我们回家后　或许我们在维克汉吃
I guess I can wait till we get home.
Maybe we'll stop at Wickham's.

1226
01:35:39,404 --> 01:35:42,168
好的　好吧
- Okay.
- Fine. Fine.

1227
01:35:48,279 --> 01:35:50,270
你还好吧
Are you okay?

1228
01:35:50,348 --> 01:35:53,647
吉尔　不要这样
Ah, Jillie, come on.
Come on, honey.

1229
01:35:53,718 --> 01:35:57,051
不要让我难受　对不起
Don't get sad on me.
I'm sorry.

1230
01:35:57,122 --> 01:36:00,057
你抱歉什么
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for?

1231
01:36:01,693 --> 01:36:04,253
我抱歉什么？
What am I sorry for?

1232
01:36:04,329 --> 01:36:08,322
我想是吃饭的事情
Well, I don't know.
I guess it was the food business.

1233
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:12,894
是想着我们出去吃快餐
I just thought we'd sneak a Big Mac
on Mommy like we used to.

1234
01:36:12,971 --> 01:36:15,201
我想回家
I wanna go home.

1235
01:36:18,877 --> 01:36:22,005
你不能这样
You can't.

1236
01:36:22,080 --> 01:36:24,139
那是违法的　我知道
That's illegal, you know.

1237
01:36:24,215 --> 01:36:26,877

I know.

1238
01:36:26,951 --> 01:36:28,885
你是警察　我已经不是了
You're a policeman.

1239
01:36:28,953 --> 01:36:33,014
不再是了
No, not anymore.

1240
01:36:33,091 --> 01:36:35,025
再也不是了
I'm nothin' anymore.

1241
01:36:51,576 --> 01:36:54,670
到了　就在这里吃了
Here we go.
Go on, grab that pocket.

1242
01:36:54,746 --> 01:36:56,976
嗯　想吃什么呢
So, what do we want?

1243
01:36:57,048 --> 01:36:59,380
吉尔　说吧想吃什么
Come on, Jillie, what do we want?
Jillie, Jillie, Jillie!

1244
01:36:59,451 --> 01:37:01,749
想吃奶油三明治吗
We want a cheese
grilled sandwich?

1245
01:37:01,820 --> 01:37:05,278
是奶酪三明治　笨..
It's called
a grilled cheese sandwich, you dub.

1246
01:37:16,201 --> 01:37:18,260
吉尔　对不起
Jill! Jill, I'm sorry.

1247
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:21,305
没事没事
Honey, nothin' happened.
Nothin' happened.

1248
01:37:21,372 --> 01:37:24,603
我想回家　好回家
- I wanna go home.
- Oh, yeah. Sure, honey.

1249
01:37:24,676 --> 01:37:28,635

We'll go home right now.
I'm sorry. Nothin' happened.

1250
01:37:28,713 --> 01:37:31,011

Let's go. Come on.

1251
01:37:33,151 --> 01:37:37,986
韦德　我有句话跟你说　杰克正在找你
Wade, I got a message for ya.
Jack Hewitt, he's lookin' for you.

1252
01:37:38,056 --> 01:37:40,786
他要你到他办公室拿走你的东西
He wants you to clear your stuff
out of his office in town hall.

1253
01:37:40,859 --> 01:37:45,421
他的办公室　你指我的办公室
- His office? You mean my old office.
- That's what he said.

1254
01:37:46,798 --> 01:37:49,733
他是那样说的　如果我是你就离开他
I'd stay away from him
if I were you.

1255
01:37:49,801 --> 01:37:51,860
他真是块烂泥
He's real pissed.

1256
01:37:54,506 --> 01:37:56,531
你没事吧，尼克
Are you all right, Nick?

1257
01:38:50,395 --> 01:38:52,625
你去哪里　玛吉
You goin' somewhere, Margie?

1258
01:38:52,697 --> 01:38:57,031
我只是想清理一堆东西　卖给垃圾站
I'm just clearing out some of the stuff
that's piled up for the rummage sale.

1259
01:38:57,101 --> 01:39:02,095
一些是送到洗衣店的衣物
And some of it's
for the cleaners and the Laundromat.

1260
01:39:02,173 --> 01:39:05,506
你骗我玛吉　你要离开我我知道的
Don't lie to me, Marge.
You're leaving me. I can see that.

1261
01:39:05,577 --> 01:39:07,511
别傻了
Don't be silly.

1262
01:39:09,547 --> 01:39:11,481
你好吉尔
Hi, Jill.

1263
01:39:17,422 --> 01:39:19,481
玛吉
Marge.

1264
01:39:31,402 --> 01:39:33,893
噢　玛吉
Oh, Marge.

1265
01:39:35,073 --> 01:39:38,702
帮在我　玛吉
Oh. Oh.
Help me, Marge.

1266
01:39:38,776 --> 01:39:40,710
放开我
Leave me alone!

1267
01:39:40,778 --> 01:39:46,080
放开我
- Leave me alone!
- Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

1268
01:39:46,150 --> 01:39:48,243
放开她
Leave her alone!

1269
01:39:59,097 --> 01:40:02,225
我要回家　你可以载我回家吗？
- I wanna go home.
Will you take me home?
- Jill.

1270
01:40:05,003 --> 01:40:06,937
吉尔
Jill?

1271
01:40:37,268 --> 01:40:39,259

Oh, my.

1272
01:40:39,337 --> 01:40:44,070
你啊　天知道
You! By Christ!

1273
01:40:44,142 --> 01:40:46,269
我就知道你
You! I know you!

1274
01:40:48,546 --> 01:40:50,514
是啊
Ah, yes.

1275
01:40:50,581 --> 01:40:54,039

You. Yeah, you goddamn...

1276
01:40:54,118 --> 01:40:56,143
你这臭小子
son of a bitch.

1277
01:40:56,220 --> 01:40:58,745
我了解你
I know you.

1278
01:40:58,823 --> 01:41:02,589
你体内流的是我的血
You're my blood. You're a goddamn
fuckin' piece of my heart.

1279
01:41:04,295 --> 01:41:06,991
你不了解我
You don't know me.

1280
01:41:07,065 --> 01:41:10,193

You don't know me.

1281
01:41:10,268 --> 01:41:12,202
去你的
Fuck you.

1282
01:41:12,270 --> 01:41:15,205

Fuck you!

1283
01:41:15,273 --> 01:41:19,141
你最后都有此下场
You done finally done it.

1284
01:41:19,210 --> 01:41:23,203
要做个男子汉吧
Done it right.
Done it like a man done it.

1285
01:41:23,281 --> 01:41:25,647
用我教你的方法
Just the way I taught ya.

1286
01:41:25,717 --> 01:41:29,983
该死的
Oh, goddamn!

1287
01:41:30,054 --> 01:41:32,682
我爱你　你是个臭小子
I love you,
you mean son of a bitch.

1288
01:41:32,757 --> 01:41:37,160
你知道什么叫爱
- I do.
- Love. What do you know about love?

1289
01:41:37,228 --> 01:41:41,255
爱　我就是爱
Love? Hell,
I'm made of love.

1290
01:41:41,332 --> 01:41:43,960
你说你想要什么
Call it what you want.

1291
01:41:44,035 --> 01:41:46,003
你所知道的事
Everything you know...

1292
01:41:46,070 --> 01:41:48,800
说给我听
- comes from me.
- Yeah.

1293
01:41:48,873 --> 01:41:49,999

Bang!

1294
01:41:52,643 --> 01:41:54,577
你和我
You and me!

1295
01:41:56,280 --> 01:41:58,748
你要去哪
Where the hell you goin'?

1296
01:41:58,816 --> 01:42:03,378
你去哪韦德　不要碰我的车
Where you goin', Wade? Best you leave
my goddamn truck where it is.

1297
01:42:03,454 --> 01:42:07,390
韦德　把钥匙给我
Wade, I need to...
Gimme those keys.

1298
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:09,983
韦德　我要到镇上去
Wade! I need to get to town.

1299
01:42:10,061 --> 01:42:12,894
爬着去吧
Crawl.

1300
01:42:12,964 --> 01:42:17,560
屋风没酒了　我要买些回来
There's hardly any booze left in
the house. I gotta get me some Brown's.

1301
01:42:17,635 --> 01:42:20,331

Hey!

1302
01:42:20,404 --> 01:42:23,999
这是我的房子我的钱
It's my house, my money,

1303
01:42:24,075 --> 01:42:26,839
我的车
my goddamn truck!

1304
01:42:26,911 --> 01:42:29,072
偷车
Stolen!

1305
01:42:34,051 --> 01:42:37,077
你和我
You and me.

1306
01:42:37,155 --> 01:42:40,750
你和我
You and me.

1307
01:42:40,825 --> 01:42:43,157
我不了解你
I don't know you.

1308
01:42:43,227 --> 01:42:46,560
我自己的父亲我不了解你
My own goddamn father,
and I don't know you.

1309
01:42:46,631 --> 01:42:48,826
你和我
You and me.

1310
01:43:06,918 --> 01:43:09,284
不要对我放肆　该死的
Don't you sass me, goddamn it.

1311
01:43:33,411 --> 01:43:35,606
我也爱你
I love you too.

1312
01:43:43,521 --> 01:43:45,489
开玩笑而已
Ha. Joke.

1313
01:43:51,062 --> 01:43:53,292
爸
Pop?

1314
01:44:05,943 --> 01:44:08,002
爸
Pop?

1315
01:44:11,582 --> 01:44:13,516
爸爸
Dad.

1316
01:44:17,088 --> 01:44:19,022
爸爸
Dad.

1317
01:47:33,117 --> 01:47:35,108

Ahh.

1318
01:47:57,475 --> 01:48:00,706
大家都知道这段历史真相
The historical facts
are known by everyone.

1319
01:48:00,778 --> 01:48:05,977
所有罗福特的居民　所有新汉普郡的人　一些马萨诸塞的人
All of Lawford, all of New Hampshire,
some of Massachusetts.

1320
01:48:06,050 --> 01:48:08,814
事实不能创造历史
Facts do not make history.

1321
01:48:08,886 --> 01:48:12,219
我们的故事　韦德和我的
Our stories, Wade's and mine,

1322
01:48:12,289 --> 01:48:16,749
描述了数千来来男孩和男人的生活
describe the lives of the boys and men
for thousands of years:

1323
01:48:16,827 --> 01:48:19,489
男孩被父亲殴打
Boys who were beaten
by their fathers,

1324
01:48:19,563 --> 01:48:23,932
出生那一天就抹杀了爱和信任能力
whose capacity for love and trust
was crippled almost at birth,

1325
01:48:24,001 --> 01:48:27,437
男人最好希望能联系其他人类
men whose best hope for connection
with other human beings...

1326
01:48:27,505 --> 01:48:29,439

lay in detachment...

1327
01:48:29,507 --> 01:48:32,135
好像生活完结了
as if life were over.

1328
01:48:32,209 --> 01:48:35,576
然后我们继续在毁灭下一代
It's how we keep from destroying
in turn our own children...

1329
01:48:35,646 --> 01:48:39,514
恐吓女人令她们不爱我们
and terrorizing the women
who have the misfortune to love us;

1330
01:48:39,583 --> 01:48:43,349
我们怎么打破男人的暴力传统
How we absent ourselves from
the tradition of male violence;

1331
01:48:43,420 --> 01:48:47,447
我们怎么拒绝得分的诱惑
How we decline
the seduction of revenge.

1332
01:48:47,525 --> 01:48:52,053
杰克的卡车三天后在多伦多购物广场外翻车
Jack's truck turned up three days later
in a shopping mall in Toronto.

1333
01:48:52,129 --> 01:48:55,394
韦德杀了杰克
Wade killed Jack...

1334
01:48:55,466 --> 01:48:59,459
肯定杰克没有杀汤比利
Just as surely as Jack
did not kill Evan Twombley,

1335
01:48:59,537 --> 01:49:02,097
即使是意外
even accidentally.

1336
01:49:02,173 --> 01:49:06,576
在杰克和汤比利　拉利维亚和梅尔乔丹之间
The link between Jack and Twombley,
LaRiviere and Mel Gordon...

1337
01:49:06,644 --> 01:49:09,977
只是韦德在他想象中存在
existed only
in Wade's wild imaginings.

1338
01:49:10,047 --> 01:49:13,710
简短的说　我承认我也一样
And briefly, I admit,
in mine as well.

1339
01:49:15,019 --> 01:49:19,285
拉利维亚和梅尔乔丹从事生意
LaRiviere and Mel Gordon
were indeed in business.

1340
01:49:19,356 --> 01:49:24,225
派克山滑雪胜地远近闻名
The Parker Mountain Ski Resort
is now advertised across the country.

1341
01:49:24,295 --> 01:49:27,890
罗福特社区不复存在了
The community of Lawford,
as such, no longer exists.

1342
01:49:27,965 --> 01:49:32,595
而是一个经济区
It is an economic zone
between Littleton and Catamount.

1343
01:49:32,670 --> 01:49:36,970
房子仍用韦德的名字　我来交税
The house is still in Wade's name,
and I keep paying taxes on it.

1344
01:49:37,041 --> 01:49:39,509
屋仍是空的
It remains empty.

1345
01:49:39,577 --> 01:49:43,035
我时不时路经这里　我坐在车里
Now and then I drive out there
and sit in my car,

1346
01:49:43,113 --> 01:49:45,877
想知道为什么不放弃它
and wonder why not let it go.

1347
01:49:45,950 --> 01:49:50,887
为什么不让拉利维亚买下它
Why not let LaRiviere buy it and
build the condominiums he wants there?

1348
01:49:52,289 --> 01:49:55,850
建立他的王国
We want to believe Wade died
that same November,

1349
01:49:55,926 --> 01:49:59,692
我们相信韦德同年十一月死了
froze to death on a bench
or a sidewalk.

1350
01:49:59,763 --> 01:50:02,231
在路边被冻死
You cannot understand
how a man,

1351
01:50:02,299 --> 01:50:06,235
你不能明白一个男人　一个和我们一样普通男人做这样的事
a normal man, a man like you and me,
could do such a terrible thing.

1352
01:50:08,472 --> 01:50:13,307
除非警察来这里拘捕流浪者
Unless the police happen
to arrest a vagrant who
turns out to be Wade Whitehouse,

1353
01:50:13,377 --> 01:50:16,744
就没有提及他的名字
there will be
no more mention of him.

1354
01:50:16,814 --> 01:50:19,942
还他的朋友杰克
Or his friend Jack Hewitt.

1355
01:50:20,017 --> 01:50:22,713
或者我们的父亲
Or our father.

1356
01:50:22,786 --> 01:50:25,721
本故事结束了
The story will be over,

1357
01:50:25,789 --> 01:50:29,350
等待我的故事发展
except that I continue.
