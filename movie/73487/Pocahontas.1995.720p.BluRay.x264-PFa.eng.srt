01:23:03,121 --> 01:23:06,420
And you'll never
hean the wolf cny

1465
01:23:06,457 --> 01:23:09,392
To the blue conn moon

1466
01:23:09,427 --> 01:23:14,387
for whethen we ane white
on coppen-skinned

1467
01:23:14,432 --> 01:23:20,632
We need to sing with all
the voices of the mountain

1468
01:23:20,671 --> 01:23:26,166
We need to paint with
all the colons of the wind

1469
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:29,441
You can own the earth
and still

1470
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:33,780
All you'll own
is earth until

1471
01:23:33,818 --> 01:23:45,696
You can paint with all
the colons of the wind
