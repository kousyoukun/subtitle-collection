1
00:03:00,272 --> 00:03:01,689
Dad.

2
00:04:47,379 --> 00:04:51,633
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
God be with you!

3
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:56,971
Port side stick, starboard side stick,
move fast and clear those murder holes.

4
00:04:57,056 --> 00:04:59,390
I want to see plenty of beach
between men.

5
00:04:59,475 --> 00:05:03,394
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:05,563
Keep the sand out of your weapons.

7
00:05:05,689 --> 00:05:10,068
Keep those actions clear.
And I'll see you on the beach.

8
00:05:42,226 --> 00:05:44,435
Clear the murder holes!

9
00:06:00,786 --> 00:06:02,328
Over the side!

10
00:06:08,836 --> 00:06:11,254
Port and starboard, over..

11
00:07:20,449 --> 00:07:21,699
Jesus.

12
00:07:22,159 --> 00:07:23,910
Thank you..

13
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,843
I said, what the hell do we do now, sir?

14
00:09:47,304 --> 00:09:50,515
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

15
00:09:52,184 --> 00:09:55,353
- Captain Miller!
- Sergeant Horvath!

16
00:09:56,897 --> 00:10:00,566
Move your men off the beach! Go!

17
00:10:00,692 --> 00:10:01,984
Okay, you guys!

18
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,154
- Get on my ass! Follow me!
- Sir!

19
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,532
What's the rallying point?

20
00:10:07,658 --> 00:10:09,450
Anywhere but here!

21
00:10:22,548 --> 00:10:25,007
The seawall! Move up to the seawall!

22
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:27,385
Sir, I'm staying!

23
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:29,762
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

24
00:10:29,888 --> 00:10:32,431
This is all we got
between us and the Almighty.

25
00:10:32,558 --> 00:10:36,561
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

26
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:40,731
You stay here, you're dead men!

27
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:57,498
Mama! Mama!

28
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,630
Stay down! Stay down!

29
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:10,636
What are you guys?

30
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:13,431
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

31
00:11:13,515 --> 00:11:16,183
Here to set up field operations!

32
00:11:16,268 --> 00:11:17,810
Get rid of that crap!

33
00:11:17,895 --> 00:11:20,980
Grab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

34
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:31,490
- I'm hit! I'm hit!
- Briggs!

35
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:40,041
Get me out of here. I'm hit low. God!

36
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:43,210
- Medic!
- Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

37
00:11:43,295 --> 00:11:47,006
I gotta clear these obstacles,
make holes for the tanks.

38
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,425
All the armour is foundering
in the Channel.

39
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:52,762
Orders, sir. You go somewhere else.
I'm clearing this one!

40
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,639
Come on, Briggs!

41
00:11:59,227 --> 00:12:00,603
Medic!

42
00:12:37,683 --> 00:12:39,308
Move! Move!

43
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:50,111
Move! Come on! Move!

44
00:13:11,883 --> 00:13:15,219
Shore party.
No armour has made it ashore.

45
00:13:15,303 --> 00:13:20,016
We got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open.

46
00:13:20,976 --> 00:13:24,603
- Who's in command here?
- You are, sir!

47
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,691
- Sergeant Horvath!
- Sir!

48
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,818
You recognise where we are?

49
00:13:30,902 --> 00:13:33,320
Right where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is!

50
00:13:33,405 --> 00:13:36,866
Nobody's where they're supposed to be.

51
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,534
Shore party.

52
00:13:39,327 --> 00:13:41,579
First wave, ineffective.

53
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:45,708
We do not hold the beach.
Say again, we do not hold the beach.

54
00:13:46,084 --> 00:13:47,460
We're all mixed up, sir.

55
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:49,336
We got the leftovers from Fox Company,

56
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:51,380
Able Company and George Company!

57
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:55,092
Plus we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster!

58
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:59,638
Shore party. Shore party.

59
00:14:05,729 --> 00:14:08,064
CATF, CATF..

60
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:13,861
- Reiben here, sir!
- Did you see anybody else?

61
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:16,739
- Jackson, but that's about it.
- Mellish here.

62
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:20,076
Caparzo! We got deforest
back there with Wade.

63
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,913
He's hurt so bad he says
he sprung 100 leaks.

64
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,664
Wade says he's all used up.

65
00:14:25,749 --> 00:14:28,000
- Move on to somebody you can help.
- Let's go!

66
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:30,544
He's battalion surgeon, sir!

67
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,550
- Get his attention.
- Wade!

68
00:14:36,635 --> 00:14:38,135
- Yo, Doc!
- Wade!

69
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,388
- Wade! Wade! Wade!
- Wade!

70
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:45,726
- Wade! Wade! Wade!
- Too risky, Doc. Too risky.

71
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,271
- Wade!
- All right. Get him off the beach.

72
00:14:49,356 --> 00:14:53,109
I got it! We stopped the bleeding!
We stopped the bleeding!

73
00:14:54,653 --> 00:14:56,278
Fuck!

74
00:14:56,363 --> 00:14:59,657
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

75
00:14:59,741 --> 00:15:02,159
- Son of a fucking cocksucker!
- Wade! Come on. Come on.

76
00:15:02,244 --> 00:15:05,454
Wade! It's Mellish! Wade!

77
00:15:05,997 --> 00:15:07,665
- Mellish!
- Let's go!

78
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:08,916
We found Miller!

79
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,585
- Fuck it!
- Let's move! Let's move!

80
00:15:18,635 --> 00:15:21,762
This is all? This is all that's made it?

81
00:15:21,847 --> 00:15:25,349
We got scattered pretty bad, sir.
There's bound to be more.

82
00:15:26,351 --> 00:15:28,686
- Not enough. It's not enough.
- Dog One exit..

83
00:15:28,770 --> 00:15:30,146
It's gotta be that cut on the right.

84
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,731
- Or is that one on the left? Shit!
- No. No, no, no.

85
00:15:32,816 --> 00:15:35,526
Vierville is to the west of us.
This is Dog One.

86
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,861
They're killing us!

87
00:15:36,945 --> 00:15:41,073
And we don't have a fucking chance,
and that ain't fair!

88
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:45,452
Gather weapons and ammo!

89
00:15:45,537 --> 00:15:48,622
Come on, let's drag them in
off the sand!

90
00:15:56,715 --> 00:16:00,634
Reiben. Hey, Reiben, Reiben, Reiben,
where's your BAR?

91
00:16:01,386 --> 00:16:03,512
Bottom of the channel, sir.
The bitch tried to drown me.

92
00:16:03,597 --> 00:16:05,472
Find a replacement.

93
00:16:07,517 --> 00:16:10,477
Bangalores! Bring up some bangalores!

94
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:15,441
Grenades, grenades! Get me
some grenades. Get them over here!

95
00:16:18,111 --> 00:16:22,114
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

96
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:24,491
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!

97
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,994
Come on, come on, come on!

98
00:16:27,078 --> 00:16:29,914
- Jackson here, sir!
- Reiben back, sir!

99
00:16:30,582 --> 00:16:33,334
Oh, my God!

100
00:16:36,338 --> 00:16:38,797
One more. Give me one more.

101
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:46,847
Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm gonna die!

102
00:16:46,932 --> 00:16:50,893
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus! Oh, my God!

103
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,439
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.
Almost got it.

104
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:58,567
- Jesus! Lucky bastard.
- Come on.

105
00:16:59,444 --> 00:17:01,737
- Move it!
- Keep it moving. You got it?

106
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,865
God! God, help me!

107
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,409
You're not gonna die.
You're not gonna die.

108
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:10,663
You're fine. Don't look at it.
Don't look at it.

109
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:14,500
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

110
00:17:14,584 --> 00:17:17,253
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

111
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:22,800
Fire in the hole!

112
00:17:32,394 --> 00:17:36,105
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

113
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,495
That's it! Let's go!

114
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:57,084
Inspected. Morphine.

115
00:17:59,963 --> 00:18:01,338
Routine.

116
00:18:07,345 --> 00:18:08,804
Priority.

117
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,018
He's gone.

118
00:18:26,448 --> 00:18:28,198
Son of a..

119
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:31,618
- Get in there.
- Fuck. I can't move.

120
00:18:31,703 --> 00:18:32,953
- Mellish.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:18:33,038 --> 00:18:34,872
Give me your bayonet.

122
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,812
Two MG42s and two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

123
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,651
There's a little defilade over there,
but it's the perfect fire position

124
00:19:04,736 --> 00:19:06,487
if we get some goddamn armour
on the beach.

125
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:09,656
We gotta open up this draw!
We gotta get this draw open.

126
00:19:09,741 --> 00:19:11,658
Reiben, Mellish, let's get into the war!

127
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:14,745
Grab some cover
and put some fire on that crew.

128
00:19:14,829 --> 00:19:18,540
Davis, Debernardo,
Young, Valk, get ready.

129
00:19:20,877 --> 00:19:22,586
Covering fire!

130
00:19:25,924 --> 00:19:27,633
Go, go, go!

131
00:19:41,648 --> 00:19:43,607
Goddamn firing squad.

132
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,902
It's the only way we can get
everybody the hell out of here.

133
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:51,198
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

134
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:53,909
Why don't we just hand out
blindfolds, Cap?

135
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,577
All we can do here is die.

136
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,246
Covering fire!

137
00:19:59,749 --> 00:20:01,500
Go, go, go!

138
00:20:02,752 --> 00:20:04,461
Come on! Come on! Come on!

139
00:20:04,587 --> 00:20:06,463
Go, God damn it!

140
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,478
- Jackson.
- Sir.

141
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,273
- Do you see that impact crater?
- Yes, sir.

142
00:20:24,357 --> 00:20:26,733
That should give you complete defilade
from that machine-gun position.

143
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:28,694
Get in there and give me
some fire discipline.

144
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,696
Wait for my command.

145
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:37,828
Go!

146
00:20:48,882 --> 00:20:52,176
Captain, if your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

147
00:20:52,302 --> 00:20:54,553
I thought you were my mother.

148
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:58,140
Be not thou far from me, O Lord.

149
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:06,690
O my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

150
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:10,152
I detest my sins
for having offended thee, O Lord.

151
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,778
I detest my sins for having
offended thee, O Lord.

152
00:21:11,863 --> 00:21:13,906
Listen to me, Lord.

153
00:21:19,162 --> 00:21:22,748
All my strength, haste thee to help me.

154
00:21:38,556 --> 00:21:43,560
- Dog One exit! Right here!
- We're in business!

155
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:46,939
Move! Move!

156
00:22:28,273 --> 00:22:29,898
- Reiben.
- Let's go, Sarge. Go!

157
00:22:29,983 --> 00:22:31,275
Reiben.

158
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:58,594
The place is full of 'em!

159
00:23:00,138 --> 00:23:01,805
Come on, Doyle!

160
00:23:03,308 --> 00:23:04,725
Sarge?

161
00:23:10,064 --> 00:23:13,150
- Flame!
- Doyle, do it!

162
00:23:17,655 --> 00:23:20,324
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

163
00:23:42,305 --> 00:23:45,599
I'll give you "comrade,"
you son of a bitch!

164
00:23:45,683 --> 00:23:47,351
Lie down!

165
00:24:15,546 --> 00:24:18,048
Cease fire! Cease fire!

166
00:24:18,132 --> 00:24:21,301
Cut it out! Cut it out! Cease fire!

167
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:24,054
Sugar Cane. Sugar Charlie 3.

168
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,391
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the dozers.

169
00:24:27,517 --> 00:24:30,560
I'm waiting for you
to tie in my flanks. Over.

170
00:24:31,562 --> 00:24:33,063
What?

171
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:38,985
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand
what you're saying.

172
00:24:46,911 --> 00:24:49,496
What did he say? What did he say?

173
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,749
"Look, I washed for supper."

174
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,880
God damn it!

175
00:25:05,263 --> 00:25:06,847
- Hey, Fish.
- Yeah?

176
00:25:06,931 --> 00:25:09,599
Look at this. A Hitler Youth knife.

177
00:25:11,102 --> 00:25:14,271
And now
it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

178
00:25:24,198 --> 00:25:25,866
Keep it moving!

179
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:27,928
That's quite a view.

180
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,430
Yes, it is.

181
00:26:32,141 --> 00:26:33,683
Quite a view.

182
00:28:08,487 --> 00:28:10,655
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd,"

183
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,908
"no doubt by now you have
received full information.."

184
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,201
- "Dear Mrs Jensen.."
- "..untimely death of your son."

185
00:28:15,286 --> 00:28:17,203
"..no words of mine
can ever relieve the grief.."

186
00:28:17,288 --> 00:28:19,581
"Our outfit has felt his loss
tremendously."

187
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:22,417
"He was a fine soldier
and he believed very strongly in.."

188
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,211
"It's no secret any more
that we were involved"

189
00:28:25,296 --> 00:28:27,380
"in one of the most important
operations of this war."

190
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:30,008
"Al was the one
who held us all together."

191
00:28:30,092 --> 00:28:31,343
"He was always the first to volunteer.."

192
00:28:31,427 --> 00:28:35,055
"..came to a clearing near a road
where over 4,000 troops had passed.."

193
00:28:35,139 --> 00:28:37,349
"Your husband served in a combat unit"

194
00:28:37,433 --> 00:28:39,976
"whose dangerous duty
is to place itself.."

195
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:43,188
"..which we all cherish
and hold so dear."

196
00:28:43,272 --> 00:28:46,983
"The loss of Lee and others like him
is a distinct blow to the regiment."

197
00:28:47,068 --> 00:28:48,360
"I fully understand your desire"

198
00:28:48,444 --> 00:28:51,112
"to learn as much as possible
regarding the circumstances"

199
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:53,323
"leding to his death."

200
00:29:45,501 --> 00:29:47,252
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

201
00:29:47,336 --> 00:29:48,628
Yes.

202
00:29:50,631 --> 00:29:53,174
These two men died in Normandy.

203
00:29:53,801 --> 00:29:56,636
This one at Omaha Beach.

204
00:29:56,721 --> 00:30:00,181
- Sean Ryan.
- This man at Utah.

205
00:30:01,851 --> 00:30:03,560
Peter Ryan.

206
00:30:07,314 --> 00:30:10,400
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

207
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:15,572
Daniel Ryan.

208
00:30:16,282 --> 00:30:18,199
The three men are brothers, sir.

209
00:30:18,284 --> 00:30:19,743
I've just learned that, this afternoon,

210
00:30:19,827 --> 00:30:23,621
their mother is going
to be getting all three telegrams.

211
00:30:26,584 --> 00:30:28,835
That's not all. There's a fourth brother.
The youngest.

212
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,920
He parachuted in
with the 101 st Airborne,

213
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:32,464
night before the invasion.

214
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:34,382
He's somewhere in Normandy.
We don't know where.

215
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,885
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

216
00:30:41,057 --> 00:30:42,682
Come with me.

217
00:32:26,495 --> 00:32:28,872
God damn it.

218
00:32:29,707 --> 00:32:31,541
All four of them
were in the same company

219
00:32:31,625 --> 00:32:33,626
in the 29th Division,
but we split them up

220
00:32:33,711 --> 00:32:35,503
after the Sullivan brothers died
on the Juneau.

221
00:32:37,506 --> 00:32:39,340
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

222
00:32:39,425 --> 00:32:43,386
No, sir. He was dropped about
15 miles inland near Neuville.

223
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,762
But that's still deep
behind German lines.

224
00:32:44,847 --> 00:32:47,056
Now, Mac,
there is no way you can know

225
00:32:47,141 --> 00:32:50,059
where in the hell he was dropped.

226
00:32:50,144 --> 00:32:52,103
General, first reports out of
Ike's people at SHAEF

227
00:32:52,188 --> 00:32:54,063
said the 101 st is scattered
all to hell and gone.

228
00:32:54,148 --> 00:32:56,524
There's misdrops all over Normandy.

229
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,527
Now, assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

230
00:32:59,612 --> 00:33:01,070
he could be anywhere.

231
00:33:01,155 --> 00:33:03,198
In fact, he's probably KIA.

232
00:33:03,282 --> 00:33:06,951
And frankly, sir, we go sending
some sort of rescue mission,

233
00:33:07,036 --> 00:33:09,621
flathatting throughout swarms
of German reinforcements

234
00:33:09,705 --> 00:33:13,541
all along our axis of advance,
they're gonna be KIA, too.

235
00:33:36,065 --> 00:33:38,107
I have a letter here,

236
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:43,571
written a long time ago
to a Mrs Bixby in Boston.

237
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:45,573
So bear with me.

238
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,953
"Dear Madam,"

239
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:52,914
"I have been shown in the files
of the War Department"

240
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:56,751
"a statement of the Adjutant
General of Massachusetts"

241
00:33:56,835 --> 00:34:00,171
"that you are the mother of five"

242
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:06,886
"sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle."

243
00:34:09,556 --> 00:34:13,309
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine"

244
00:34:14,103 --> 00:34:17,480
"that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief"

245
00:34:17,898 --> 00:34:20,316
"of a loss so overwhelming."

246
00:34:22,152 --> 00:34:24,153
"But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you"

247
00:34:24,238 --> 00:34:27,407
"the consolation that may be found"

248
00:34:27,491 --> 00:34:31,744
"in the thanks of the republic
they died to save."

249
00:34:35,916 --> 00:34:37,208
"I pray that Our Heavenly Father"

250
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:40,378
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement"

251
00:34:40,462 --> 00:34:44,841
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved lost,"

252
00:34:45,968 --> 00:34:47,593
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours"

253
00:34:47,678 --> 00:34:51,973
"to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom."

254
00:34:52,558 --> 00:34:55,727
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,"

255
00:34:55,811 --> 00:34:57,645
"Abraham Lincoln."

256
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:18,333
That boy is alive.

257
00:35:19,043 --> 00:35:21,961
We are gonna send somebody
to find him,

258
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:26,257
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

259
00:35:27,301 --> 00:35:28,968
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:44,108
We expected 32 tanks to float to
the beach. Twenty-seven didn't make it.

261
00:35:44,193 --> 00:35:46,235
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go on in, Captain.

262
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,445
I understand your situation.

263
00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:50,615
But if we don't offload
those duel-drive Shermans by 0600,

264
00:35:50,699 --> 00:35:51,908
we're gonna have an entire division

265
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:55,703
stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.

266
00:35:55,788 --> 00:35:58,206
Well, you let me know then.

267
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:01,167
Have Charlie Company hold at Vierville
until we can get some armour up there.

268
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:03,086
Yes, sir. Runner!

269
00:36:09,551 --> 00:36:12,303
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for the rest of us.

270
00:36:12,388 --> 00:36:14,972
Instead they misdropped,
scattered all their sticks into the wind.

271
00:36:15,057 --> 00:36:19,227
- What's your situation?
- Yes, sir. Sector four is secure.

272
00:36:19,603 --> 00:36:20,853
We..

273
00:36:21,438 --> 00:36:26,526
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

274
00:36:26,610 --> 00:36:28,277
They'd already gotten four
of our Shermans

275
00:36:28,362 --> 00:36:29,654
and a number
of our deuce and a halves.

276
00:36:29,738 --> 00:36:32,698
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

277
00:36:32,783 --> 00:36:34,450
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

278
00:36:34,535 --> 00:36:36,911
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field,

279
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,121
little bit of everything.

280
00:36:38,205 --> 00:36:42,041
Spreng Mine 44s. Schuh Mine 42s,
pot mines. A-200s,

281
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:45,628
the little wooden bastards
that the mine detectors don't pick up.

282
00:36:45,712 --> 00:36:50,174
This road here, they placed
big mushrooms, Teller Mine 43s,

283
00:36:50,259 --> 00:36:51,426
I guess for our tanks,

284
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:55,012
from here right up
to the edge of the village. Right here.

285
00:36:55,097 --> 00:36:57,056
So we marked them,
called the engineers.

286
00:36:57,141 --> 00:36:58,433
Resistance?

287
00:36:58,517 --> 00:37:00,726
We had higher
support expectations, sir.

288
00:37:00,811 --> 00:37:03,104
There was an under-strength
company without artillery.

289
00:37:03,188 --> 00:37:06,441
Wehrmacht 346 Infantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

290
00:37:06,525 --> 00:37:08,568
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

291
00:37:08,652 --> 00:37:11,821
We turned them over
to MPs from the 29th.

292
00:37:14,575 --> 00:37:16,868
What about our casualties?

293
00:37:17,494 --> 00:37:19,620
Well, the figures

294
00:37:20,998 --> 00:37:24,500
were 35 dead, times two wounded.

295
00:37:24,585 --> 00:37:27,837
They just didn't wanna
give up those 88s.

296
00:37:29,756 --> 00:37:32,508
It was a tough assignment.
That's why you got it.

297
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:34,093
Yes, sir.

298
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:36,846
John..

299
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:41,726
I've got another one for you.

300
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,770
- Yes, sir.
- This one's straight from the top.

301
00:37:51,361 --> 00:37:53,529
You and I are taking a squad
over to Neuville

302
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,531
on a public-relations mission.

303
00:37:55,616 --> 00:37:57,450
You leading a squad?

304
00:37:57,534 --> 00:38:00,661
Some private in the 101 st
lost three brothers,

305
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:02,413
and he's got a ticket home.

306
00:38:02,498 --> 00:38:03,623
How come Neuville?

307
00:38:03,707 --> 00:38:07,627
They think he's up there somewhere,
part of all those airborne misdrops.

308
00:38:07,711 --> 00:38:10,421
It's not gonna be easy
finding one particular soldier

309
00:38:10,506 --> 00:38:11,672
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

310
00:38:11,757 --> 00:38:14,217
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

311
00:38:14,301 --> 00:38:15,885
But what about the company?

312
00:38:15,969 --> 00:38:19,263
We take the pick of the litter
and the rest get folded into Baker.

313
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:21,057
Jesus Christ.

314
00:38:21,141 --> 00:38:23,184
They took away your company?

315
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:27,772
It wasn't my company. It was
the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

316
00:38:27,898 --> 00:38:31,817
Give me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

317
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:33,319
Beasley's dead.

318
00:38:33,403 --> 00:38:36,197
All right, Mellish, then.
We got anybody speaks French?

319
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:40,117
- Not that I know of.
- What about Talbot?

320
00:38:40,244 --> 00:38:43,246
- This morning.
- Oh. All right.

321
00:38:43,664 --> 00:38:45,748
I'm gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

322
00:38:45,832 --> 00:38:47,583
Assemble at battalion motor pool
on the beach.

323
00:38:47,668 --> 00:38:48,751
Yes, sir.

324
00:38:48,835 --> 00:38:50,211
- Sarge, what we gonna do?
- Okay, listen up..

325
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:51,671
- What?
- What are we gonna do?

326
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:53,464
You're going home wrapped
in an American flag

327
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:55,591
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo, you smart ass.

328
00:38:55,676 --> 00:38:57,426
- Now, listen up.
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

329
00:38:57,511 --> 00:38:58,844
- What?
- I thought you liked it in the ass.

330
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:01,639
Attention!

331
00:39:01,765 --> 00:39:02,974
As you were.

332
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,142
I'm looking
for Corporal Upham, Timothy E.

333
00:39:05,269 --> 00:39:06,561
Yes, sir. I'm Upham, sir.

334
00:39:06,645 --> 00:39:08,271
I understand you speak
French and German.

335
00:39:08,355 --> 00:39:10,147
- Yes, sir.
- How's your accent?

336
00:39:10,274 --> 00:39:11,899
Just a slight one in French,
but my German's clean.

337
00:39:11,984 --> 00:39:13,651
- Has a touch of Bavarian, sir.
- Very good.

338
00:39:13,777 --> 00:39:15,319
You've been reassigned to me.
Grab your gear.

339
00:39:15,445 --> 00:39:17,780
- We're going to a place called Neuville.
- Yes, sir.

340
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:20,032
- When was this updated?
- Updated as of 0830 hour this morning.

341
00:39:20,117 --> 00:39:22,368
- Sir..
- This is the 12th SS Panzer.

342
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:24,287
These are the two axes
that advance south.

343
00:39:24,371 --> 00:39:26,831
- Sir, there are Germans in Neuville.
- There are artillery up here, sir.

344
00:39:26,957 --> 00:39:29,625
- That's what I understand. Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,877
Sir, there are a lot
of Germans in Neuville.

346
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:33,045
You have a problem with that, Corporal?

347
00:39:33,130 --> 00:39:35,590
No, sir. Just if you consider
I've never been in combat, sir.

348
00:39:35,674 --> 00:39:37,300
I make maps and I translate.
And that's..

349
00:39:37,384 --> 00:39:40,303
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

350
00:39:40,387 --> 00:39:42,138
- Yes, sir.
- My two guys were killed.

351
00:39:42,222 --> 00:39:44,890
Yes, sir. It's just that I haven't
held a weapon since basic training, sir.

352
00:39:44,975 --> 00:39:47,602
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

353
00:39:47,686 --> 00:39:48,894
Yes, sir.

354
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:51,731
- Well, then, get your gear.
- Yes, sir.

355
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:55,151
Sir, may I bring..

356
00:39:58,905 --> 00:40:01,407
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

357
00:40:06,496 --> 00:40:07,830
Yes, sir.

358
00:40:11,084 --> 00:40:12,877
Thank you very much, sir.

359
00:40:13,003 --> 00:40:15,338
- That a souvenir?
- No, sir.

360
00:40:15,422 --> 00:40:17,590
Take your time, Corporal.

361
00:40:21,928 --> 00:40:24,472
You should look
on the bright side of things, Corporal.

362
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:25,681
Yes, sir.

363
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:28,809
For one thing,
you don't need to carry those.

364
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:31,854
- You'll need that.
- I'll need that, sir. Yes, sir.

365
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,831
Hey.

366
00:41:31,915 --> 00:41:34,083
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

367
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,460
Don't you ever fucking touch me
with those little rat claws again.

368
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:39,088
Get the fuck back in formation.

369
00:41:40,465 --> 00:41:43,968
I was just wondering
where you're from, that's..

370
00:41:49,015 --> 00:41:51,434
- Caparzo, is it?
- Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

371
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:52,643
Got you.

372
00:41:52,769 --> 00:41:54,937
And another thing.
Every time you salute the captain,

373
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:57,231
you make him a target for the Germans.

374
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:59,108
So do us a favour. Don't do it.

375
00:41:59,192 --> 00:42:02,153
Especially when I'm standing
next to him, capisci?

376
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:05,281
Corporal, what's your book about?

377
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:07,074
- Hey. Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

378
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,409
Actually, it's about the..

379
00:42:08,493 --> 00:42:09,952
It's supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhood

380
00:42:10,036 --> 00:42:11,954
that develop between
soldiers during war.

381
00:42:12,038 --> 00:42:14,123
Brotherhood?

382
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:15,791
What do you know about brotherhood?

383
00:42:15,876 --> 00:42:18,002
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

384
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:21,088
Why don't you ask
the captain where he's from?

385
00:42:21,173 --> 00:42:25,551
Yeah, ask the captain. He'll tell you
everything you wanna know about him.

386
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:27,803
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

387
00:42:27,888 --> 00:42:30,181
I mean, where's the sense
of risking the lives of the eight of us

388
00:42:30,307 --> 00:42:31,849
to save one guy.

389
00:42:31,975 --> 00:42:35,102
Twenty degrees.
Anybody wanna answer that?

390
00:42:35,187 --> 00:42:38,731
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

391
00:42:38,815 --> 00:42:40,608
Hey, doc. I got a mother, all right?

392
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:43,235
I mean, you got a mother.
Sarge has got a mother.

393
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,989
I mean, shit, I bet even
the captain's got a mother.

394
00:42:47,073 --> 00:42:49,909
Well, maybe not the captain,
but the rest of us got mothers.

395
00:42:49,993 --> 00:42:53,662
"Theirs not to reason why
Theirs but to do and die"

396
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,832
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, Corporal, huh?

397
00:42:56,917 --> 00:42:58,584
We're all supposed to die. Is that it?

398
00:42:58,668 --> 00:43:01,420
Upham's talking about
our duty as soldiers.

399
00:43:01,505 --> 00:43:04,006
- Yes, sir.
- We all have orders we have to follow.

400
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,801
And that supersedes everything,
including your mothers.

401
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:08,469
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

402
00:43:08,553 --> 00:43:10,971
Even if you think
the mission's FUBAR, sir?

403
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:14,058
Especially if you think
the mission's FUBAR.

404
00:43:14,184 --> 00:43:17,853
- What's FUBAR?
- Oh, it's German. Yeah.

405
00:43:18,438 --> 00:43:20,523
Never heard of that.

406
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,901
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

407
00:43:24,694 --> 00:43:27,613
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

408
00:43:27,697 --> 00:43:29,907
Well, from my way of thinking, sir,

409
00:43:30,033 --> 00:43:32,368
this entire mission
is a serious misallocation

410
00:43:32,452 --> 00:43:34,870
of valuable military resources.

411
00:43:34,955 --> 00:43:36,872
Yeah. Go on.

412
00:43:36,957 --> 00:43:39,416
Well, it seems to me, sir,
that God gave me a special gift,

413
00:43:39,543 --> 00:43:42,795
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

414
00:43:42,879 --> 00:43:45,589
Reiben, pay attention.
Now, this is the way to gripe!

415
00:43:45,715 --> 00:43:46,966
Continue, Jackson.

416
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,926
Well, what I mean by that, sir,

417
00:43:49,052 --> 00:43:51,720
is if you was to put me
and this here sniper rifle anywhere,

418
00:43:51,805 --> 00:43:54,557
up to and including one mile
of Adolf Hitler

419
00:43:54,641 --> 00:43:56,350
with a clear line of sight, sir..

420
00:43:56,434 --> 00:43:59,311
Pack your bags, fellas.
War's over. Amen.

421
00:43:59,396 --> 00:44:01,689
Oh, that's brilliant, bumpkin.

422
00:44:01,773 --> 00:44:04,817
So, Captain, what about you?
I mean, you don't gripe at all?

423
00:44:04,901 --> 00:44:07,319
I don't gripe to you, Reiben.
I'm a captain.

424
00:44:07,404 --> 00:44:10,322
There's a chain of command.
Gripes go up, not down. Always up.

425
00:44:10,407 --> 00:44:11,699
You gripe to me,

426
00:44:11,783 --> 00:44:15,327
I gripe to my superior officers,
so on, so on and so on.

427
00:44:15,412 --> 00:44:17,204
I don't gripe to you.
I don't gripe in front of you.

428
00:44:17,289 --> 00:44:19,290
You should know that as a Ranger.

429
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,250
I'm sorry, sir, but..

430
00:44:21,334 --> 00:44:24,169
Let's say you weren't a captain,
or maybe I was a major.

431
00:44:24,254 --> 00:44:26,046
What would you say then?

432
00:44:26,131 --> 00:44:27,923
Well, in that case,

433
00:44:28,008 --> 00:44:30,092
I'd say this is an excellent mission, sir,

434
00:44:30,176 --> 00:44:33,304
with an extremely
valuable objective, sir,

435
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,847
worthy of my best efforts, sir.

436
00:44:34,931 --> 00:44:40,436
Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private James Ryan,

437
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:44,064
and am willing to lay down my life
and the lives of my men,

438
00:44:44,149 --> 00:44:47,610
especially you, Reiben,
to ease her suffering.

439
00:44:49,112 --> 00:44:51,113
- He's good.
- I love him.

440
00:45:01,791 --> 00:45:03,167
Right.

441
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:48,253
- Thunder!
- Flash!

442
00:45:48,338 --> 00:45:51,590
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

443
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,102
Go, go, go, go, go!

444
00:46:08,441 --> 00:46:11,402
- You guys are a sight for sore eyes.
- Sergeant Hill, our relief showed up.

445
00:46:11,486 --> 00:46:13,278
How many are you?

446
00:46:13,363 --> 00:46:15,990
Just eight of us.
We're not your relief. Sorry.

447
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:17,616
You're not the relief,
what do you mean, sir?

448
00:46:17,701 --> 00:46:19,284
We're here for a Private Ryan.

449
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:21,912
Who? Ryan? What for?

450
00:46:21,997 --> 00:46:23,122
- Is he here?
- Well, I don't know.

451
00:46:23,206 --> 00:46:25,499
Maybe with a mixed unit
on the other side of town.

452
00:46:25,583 --> 00:46:27,668
It's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our centre

453
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:29,628
a few hours ago,
they cut us right in two.

454
00:46:29,713 --> 00:46:33,215
- What's his name again?
- Ryan. James Ryan.

455
00:46:33,299 --> 00:46:34,675
He dropped in with 101st.

456
00:46:34,759 --> 00:46:37,720
- Goldman, get me a runner up here.
- Runner!

457
00:46:37,804 --> 00:46:39,471
Come on.

458
00:46:43,435 --> 00:46:46,020
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

459
00:46:47,564 --> 00:46:50,691
We got stopped by some intense
rifle action from the eastward.

460
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:54,486
The Germans have been
reinforcing two regiments all day.

461
00:46:54,571 --> 00:46:56,780
The streets have been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

462
00:46:56,865 --> 00:46:59,366
Most of the German fire now
is concentrated to the westward.

463
00:46:59,451 --> 00:47:00,659
Who's that on the loudspeaker?

464
00:47:00,744 --> 00:47:02,745
That? That's Dagwood Dusseldorf,

465
00:47:02,829 --> 00:47:04,663
our friendly neighbourhood
morale officer.

466
00:47:04,748 --> 00:47:07,750
The Statue of Liberty is kaput.

467
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:11,211
- "The Statue of Liberty is kaput."
- ..kaput.

468
00:47:11,296 --> 00:47:13,088
That's disconcerting.

469
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:17,718
Take the second left..

470
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:21,096
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

471
00:47:21,181 --> 00:47:24,266
Private Ryan, James,
probably misdropped with the 101.

472
00:47:24,350 --> 00:47:26,351
- Got that?
- Cover!

473
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:35,402
Go!

474
00:47:59,385 --> 00:48:01,595
- You sadistic fucking animals!
- Get down.

475
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:04,765
They know we're not in direct contact.
They're gonna single out the runners.

476
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,558
Yeah. Why do they
keep shooting him up like that?

477
00:48:06,643 --> 00:48:09,269
Long as his lungs have breath in them,
he still carries the message.

478
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:11,063
- We'd do the same thing.
- No, we wouldn't!

479
00:48:11,147 --> 00:48:14,108
- Wade! Get them ready to travel.
- Yes, sir.

480
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:16,068
- Boyd!
- Come on!

481
00:48:16,152 --> 00:48:18,904
Try again. See if you can let
Captain Hamill know we're coming.

482
00:48:18,988 --> 00:48:21,573
What's the rest of Neuville look like?

483
00:48:21,658 --> 00:48:24,034
Next block's got two-storey buildings,
both sides of the street.

484
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,494
- There's a lot of windows.
- ..copy? Over.

485
00:48:25,578 --> 00:48:27,955
And then there's a wide open square
with pretty good cover on the left.

486
00:48:28,039 --> 00:48:30,290
- Show me.
- Sarge, hold right here.

487
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,792
Yes, sir!

488
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:38,841
All right. Let's stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

489
00:48:38,925 --> 00:48:40,050
Try a left hook.

490
00:48:40,135 --> 00:48:41,885
Shoot and scoot,
two of yours, two of mine.

491
00:48:41,970 --> 00:48:44,429
Hastings, Goldman, up front!

492
00:48:45,598 --> 00:48:48,392
- Reiben, Caparzo. Fundamentals.
- They're still jamming us.

493
00:48:48,476 --> 00:48:51,103
Short runs. High and low at the corners.

494
00:48:51,187 --> 00:48:53,647
It's gonna be tight.
Be prepared for close contact.

495
00:48:53,731 --> 00:48:55,566
- Go. Upham.
- Yes, sir.

496
00:48:55,650 --> 00:48:57,776
- You stay with Sergeant Horvath.
- Stay right here.

497
00:48:57,861 --> 00:49:01,488
I'll wear him like underwear, Captain!
Stay with me.

498
00:49:09,622 --> 00:49:11,081
All right, past the end
of the block to the left.

499
00:49:11,166 --> 00:49:12,291
Those are the gates to the square.

500
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,667
Good.

501
00:49:21,676 --> 00:49:23,468
Reiben, where's the captain from?

502
00:49:23,553 --> 00:49:25,721
You figure that one out,
you got yourself a nice prize.

503
00:49:25,805 --> 00:49:27,431
300 bucks, last I heard.

504
00:49:27,515 --> 00:49:30,767
Company's got a pool.
5 bucks gets you in.

505
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:36,523
Easy.

506
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:41,987
It's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

507
00:49:43,156 --> 00:49:45,574
Somebody must know where he's from,
what he did for a living.

508
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:47,492
I've been with him
since Kasserine Pass,

509
00:49:47,577 --> 00:49:48,744
but I don't have a clue.

510
00:49:48,828 --> 00:49:50,621
My ankles are killing me.

511
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:53,665
I'll need a wheelchair
before this war is over.

512
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:56,210
Oh, that's it. Oh, my God.

513
00:49:56,294 --> 00:49:59,546
Got ankles like an old woman.
Like an old..

514
00:49:59,631 --> 00:50:01,340
Oh, God.

515
00:50:03,092 --> 00:50:06,261
Reiben, so, you don't even know
where he went to school?

516
00:50:06,346 --> 00:50:07,554
Captain didn't go to school.

517
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:10,807
They assembled him at OCS
out of spare body parts of dead Gls.

518
00:50:10,892 --> 00:50:12,267
You gotta pay attention to detail.

519
00:50:12,352 --> 00:50:14,269
I know exactly where he's from
and exactly what he did

520
00:50:14,354 --> 00:50:16,605
'cause I pay attention to detail.

521
00:50:16,689 --> 00:50:20,150
Hey, Upham,
careful you don't step in the bullshit.

522
00:50:25,490 --> 00:50:27,866
- Do it.
- Thunder!

523
00:50:27,951 --> 00:50:31,078
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

524
00:50:40,463 --> 00:50:43,882
Upham, tell them to show themselves.

525
00:50:55,186 --> 00:50:58,230
Ask them if they know
where the Germans are.

526
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,237
- What's he saying?
- Something about the children.

527
00:51:06,281 --> 00:51:08,782
- They want us to take the children.
- No, no, no. We can't take the kids.

528
00:51:08,866 --> 00:51:10,534
We can't take the kids. We can't!

529
00:51:10,618 --> 00:51:13,870
We can't take the kids! No!

530
00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:17,916
They think they'll be safe with us.

531
00:51:18,001 --> 00:51:20,168
It's not gonna be
safe when they're with us!

532
00:51:20,253 --> 00:51:24,298
- It's okay. It's okay.
- Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!

533
00:51:24,382 --> 00:51:28,176
- Are you nuts? Listen to the captain!
- They think they'll be safe with us, sir.

534
00:51:28,469 --> 00:51:31,763
Caparzo! Put that kid back!

535
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,515
It's okay.

536
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:36,852
- Caparzo! Put that little girl back!
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

537
00:51:36,936 --> 00:51:39,980
Caparzo, give that kid back now!

538
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:44,109
Upham, how do you say, "It's okay"?
I can't. She reminds me of my niece, sir.

539
00:51:44,193 --> 00:51:46,153
Caparzo, get the kid back up there!

540
00:51:46,237 --> 00:51:47,571
Captain, the decent thing to do

541
00:51:47,655 --> 00:51:49,865
is to at least take her down
the road to the next town.

542
00:51:49,949 --> 00:51:53,201
We're not here to do the decent thing!
We're here to follow fucking orders!

543
00:51:53,286 --> 00:51:55,662
Sarge, take this goddamn kid!

544
00:51:56,414 --> 00:51:58,582
Cover! Cover!

545
00:52:07,884 --> 00:52:10,802
God damn it! Where'd that come from?

546
00:52:12,597 --> 00:52:16,058
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

547
00:52:20,813 --> 00:52:22,731
That's where I'd be.

548
00:52:24,609 --> 00:52:25,817
I didn't see it.

549
00:52:25,902 --> 00:52:28,737
Four hundred fifty yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

550
00:52:28,821 --> 00:52:33,075
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas!
This sniper's got talent!

551
00:52:37,538 --> 00:52:40,999
Please don't cry. I'm gonna take you
back to your mama and papa.

552
00:52:41,084 --> 00:52:43,293
Please don't cry. Come on.

553
00:52:46,547 --> 00:52:47,964
Carpy.

554
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,395
- Captain.
- Hold on, Caparzo.

555
00:53:02,814 --> 00:53:04,981
Help me up. I can walk. I can walk.

556
00:53:05,108 --> 00:53:07,234
Caparzo, stay still!

557
00:53:18,663 --> 00:53:20,956
Two clicks, left wind.

558
00:53:24,627 --> 00:53:25,961
Fish!

559
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:36,763
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

560
00:53:36,848 --> 00:53:38,807
Wade, you stay put.

561
00:53:38,933 --> 00:53:41,101
Where's he shot, Captain?

562
00:53:42,937 --> 00:53:45,480
- Captain, can you see him from there?
- You stay there!

563
00:53:45,606 --> 00:53:49,234
Damn it, stay down!
What's the matter with you?

564
00:53:49,318 --> 00:53:53,071
Am I gonna take care of you
if you get hit? Huh?

565
00:53:53,156 --> 00:53:56,408
- Fish, come over here.
- Carpy, put your head down.

566
00:53:56,492 --> 00:53:59,661
Why can't you put your head down?

567
00:54:07,336 --> 00:54:10,172
O my God, I trust in thee.

568
00:54:10,298 --> 00:54:12,299
Let me not be ashamed.

569
00:54:13,176 --> 00:54:16,011
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

570
00:54:25,813 --> 00:54:27,481
Copy it.

571
00:54:27,565 --> 00:54:29,900
Copy it and send it for me.

572
00:54:29,984 --> 00:54:32,444
Carpy, you're gonna send it yourself.
Put it down!

573
00:54:32,528 --> 00:54:35,822
- It's got blood!
- I see it. Carpy, I see it.

574
00:54:40,369 --> 00:54:44,498
It's to my dad. It's
got blood on it, Fish.

575
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:15,070
We got him. Stay down.

576
00:55:23,788 --> 00:55:27,999
- How bad is it?
- Chest, maybe lung shot.

577
00:55:43,432 --> 00:55:45,976
Get that 30 up the street!

578
00:55:50,773 --> 00:55:52,023
Detail!

579
00:55:52,108 --> 00:55:54,192
- Clear up!
- Clear down!

580
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:12,752
That's why we can't take children.

581
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:22,387
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

582
00:56:22,471 --> 00:56:26,141
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

583
00:56:26,726 --> 00:56:28,518
- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.

584
00:56:28,603 --> 00:56:32,981
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.

585
00:56:33,065 --> 00:56:34,733
- Jackson!
- Sir.

586
00:56:34,817 --> 00:56:39,613
Mellish, check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now. Go!

587
00:56:51,459 --> 00:56:53,084
Fuck Ryan.

588
00:57:03,596 --> 00:57:06,014
- Thunder!
- Flash!

589
00:57:06,098 --> 00:57:07,641
Come on in.

590
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:14,689
Hey, guys, we're looking
for Captain Hamill.

591
00:57:14,774 --> 00:57:16,524
Somewhere down there
across the square.

592
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:17,901
Across the square.

593
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:20,570
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

594
00:57:21,155 --> 00:57:22,906
Sit down.

595
00:57:39,465 --> 00:57:42,050
Jimmy T, go find Captain Hamill,
bring him in here.

596
00:57:42,134 --> 00:57:43,468
What? Up there?

597
00:57:43,552 --> 00:57:46,304
How the hell should I know?
Would you go look, please?

598
00:57:46,389 --> 00:57:48,348
Thank you, you moron.

599
00:57:49,725 --> 00:57:51,309
All right.

600
00:57:51,394 --> 00:57:54,854
You guys just flake out here for a while.

601
00:57:56,816 --> 00:58:00,276
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

602
00:58:10,246 --> 00:58:12,080
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

603
00:58:12,164 --> 00:58:15,375
- Drop them now!
- Drop the fucking weapons!

604
00:58:18,212 --> 00:58:22,257
- I'll shoot you! I'll shoot you!
- Drop! Drop! Drop them!

605
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,095
Now! Put them down!

606
00:58:42,194 --> 00:58:43,611
Clear up!

607
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:52,620
- Shit. Shit!
- Clear up!

608
00:58:54,081 --> 00:58:55,623
Clear down!

609
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:11,347
- Enough to make you old.
- Let's hope so.

610
00:59:22,318 --> 00:59:23,818
Fred Hamill, Pathfinders, 101 st.

611
00:59:23,903 --> 00:59:26,863
John Miller, 2nd Rangers. Thank you.

612
00:59:28,783 --> 00:59:30,408
We're here looking
for a Private James Ryan.

613
00:59:30,493 --> 00:59:33,495
He's part of your outfit.
Any chance at all you policed him up?

614
00:59:34,205 --> 00:59:36,748
- How was the road in?
- Scenic.

615
00:59:37,291 --> 00:59:41,002
- We lost most of our ammo.
- Not to mention one of our men.

616
00:59:41,504 --> 00:59:44,756
Lieutenant, redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

617
00:59:45,007 --> 00:59:47,801
- Yes, sir!
- And get Ryan up here.

618
00:59:50,137 --> 00:59:53,056
Ryan! Ryan, front and centre!

619
00:59:53,557 --> 00:59:54,849
Ryan!

620
00:59:58,521 --> 01:00:00,522
Here comes our boy.

621
01:00:08,322 --> 01:00:11,032
Told you he was an asshole.

622
01:00:12,368 --> 01:00:14,661
- Sir, Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

623
01:00:15,204 --> 01:00:18,581
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers.
He wants a word with you.

624
01:00:20,209 --> 01:00:21,709
This way.

625
01:00:22,545 --> 01:00:25,338
All right. Take a knee.

626
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:38,226
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

627
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:49,612
Well, there isn't any real
easy way to say this, so..

628
01:00:51,991 --> 01:00:55,243
So I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

629
01:00:56,662 --> 01:01:00,415
We have orders to come get you

630
01:01:01,417 --> 01:01:03,585
because you're going home.

631
01:01:17,516 --> 01:01:20,143
Oh, my God. My brothers are dead.

632
01:01:27,610 --> 01:01:31,237
I was supposed to take them fishing
when we got home.

633
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:48,129
I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

634
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:53,801
- How.. How did they die?
- They were killed in action.

635
01:01:56,305 --> 01:01:59,223
That can't be. They're..

636
01:01:59,975 --> 01:02:03,937
That.. That can't be.
My brothers are still in grammar school.

637
01:02:07,316 --> 01:02:10,276
- You're James Ryan?
- Yeah.

638
01:02:11,403 --> 01:02:14,155
James Francis Ryan from Iowa?

639
01:02:14,657 --> 01:02:17,200
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

640
01:02:24,124 --> 01:02:26,376
What? Does that mean
my brothers are okay?

641
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:28,169
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

642
01:02:28,253 --> 01:02:30,046
Are you sure they're okay, though?

643
01:02:30,130 --> 01:02:31,547
We're looking
for a different Private Ryan.

644
01:02:31,632 --> 01:02:33,633
This is just a big foul-up.

645
01:02:33,717 --> 01:02:35,593
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

646
01:02:35,678 --> 01:02:39,806
How do you know the foul-up isn't
that his brothers are okay and that..

647
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:42,058
Lieutenant, I'm sorry for the trouble.

648
01:02:42,142 --> 01:02:46,312
I just wrote them a letter right
before I left. I got to get home.

649
01:02:47,606 --> 01:02:49,565
I got to get home right now.

650
01:02:49,650 --> 01:02:52,151
- I wanna go home.
- Easy, now.

651
01:02:53,070 --> 01:02:54,612
- So, where in the hell is our Ryan?
- I don't know.

652
01:02:54,697 --> 01:02:56,781
Are you in touch with your CO?

653
01:02:56,865 --> 01:02:58,741
- That figures.
- What unit's your Ryan in?

654
01:02:58,826 --> 01:03:01,035
Baker Company, 506th.

655
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:02,662
The guy with the broken foot,
he's 506, right?

656
01:03:02,746 --> 01:03:04,414
Yeah. Charlie, I think.

657
01:03:04,498 --> 01:03:06,165
- You think?
- Yeah.

658
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,502
Ryan? Don't know.. Man!

659
01:03:09,586 --> 01:03:12,171
- Where was your drop zone?
- Just inside of Vierville.

660
01:03:12,256 --> 01:03:15,133
Vierville? How the hell did you
end up way up here?

661
01:03:15,217 --> 01:03:18,469
You got me, sir. C-47 took heavy fire.

662
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:21,305
Pilot went crazy trying to get out
of there, turning every which way.

663
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:25,351
Took more fire on the drop.
Got messy. I ended up here.

664
01:03:25,436 --> 01:03:27,478
I haven't seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

665
01:03:27,563 --> 01:03:28,980
God knows where they are.

666
01:03:29,064 --> 01:03:30,773
Anybody from Baker Company
have, like, a big mouth?

667
01:03:30,858 --> 01:03:32,650
Talk about where the drop zone
might've been?

668
01:03:32,735 --> 01:03:36,237
No, sir, but I know Baker Company
had the same rally point as us.

669
01:03:36,321 --> 01:03:37,572
Show me.

670
01:03:38,991 --> 01:03:39,991
My men are beat.

671
01:03:40,075 --> 01:03:42,035
We're gonna hold up here
for about three hours.

672
01:03:42,119 --> 01:03:44,662
We'll pull out after dark.

673
01:03:44,747 --> 01:03:47,665
Got anything left in this town
like a three-star hotel?

674
01:03:47,750 --> 01:03:50,960
Something with clean sheets
and soft pillows and room service?

675
01:03:51,045 --> 01:03:54,505
- How about a nice, comfy church?
- We'll take that.

676
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:57,425
What have you heard?
How's it all falling together?

677
01:03:57,509 --> 01:03:59,135
Well, we got the beachhead secure.

678
01:03:59,219 --> 01:04:01,846
Problem is Monty's taking
his time moving on Caen.

679
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:04,182
We can't pull out till he's ready, so..

680
01:04:04,266 --> 01:04:06,893
- That guy's overrated.
- No argument here.

681
01:04:06,977 --> 01:04:09,771
You gotta take Caen,
so you can take Saint-Lô.

682
01:04:09,855 --> 01:04:11,773
You got to take Saint-Lô
to take Valognes.

683
01:04:11,857 --> 01:04:13,524
Valognes, you got Cherbourg.

684
01:04:13,609 --> 01:04:16,944
- Cherbourg, you got Paris.
- Paris, you get Berlin.

685
01:04:17,404 --> 01:04:19,781
And then that big boat home.

686
01:04:23,118 --> 01:04:24,660
We sure as hell
could use you around here,

687
01:04:24,745 --> 01:04:26,954
but I understand what you're doing.

688
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:28,664
- You do?
- Yeah.

689
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:31,375
I got a couple of brothers myself.

690
01:04:31,919 --> 01:04:34,462
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

691
01:04:34,797 --> 01:04:38,800
No, I mean it. Find him. Get him home.

692
01:04:47,226 --> 01:04:49,227
What's with your hand?

693
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,522
I don't know.

694
01:04:54,233 --> 01:04:55,566
It started in Portsmouth

695
01:04:55,651 --> 01:04:57,318
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

696
01:04:57,444 --> 01:04:58,903
It comes and goes.

697
01:04:58,987 --> 01:05:01,906
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

698
01:05:01,990 --> 01:05:05,368
This one doesn't seem
to agree with you any more.

699
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:11,999
What?

700
01:05:16,630 --> 01:05:18,214
- What?
- Nothing.

701
01:05:19,007 --> 01:05:21,759
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

702
01:05:21,844 --> 01:05:24,345
The one that was always walking
around on his hands, you know?

703
01:05:24,471 --> 01:05:28,057
And he was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze.

704
01:05:28,142 --> 01:05:29,851
- Vecchio.
- Vecchio.

705
01:05:36,441 --> 01:05:37,775
Yeah, Vecchio.

706
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:39,735
He was a goofy kid.

707
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,490
Remember, he used to pee
a "V" on everybody's jacket

708
01:05:44,575 --> 01:05:47,869
for Vecchio, for victory.

709
01:05:52,499 --> 01:05:56,252
He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

710
01:05:56,336 --> 01:05:59,088
"How did you get to be a Ranger?"

711
01:06:00,340 --> 01:06:02,675
He got shot in the foot once, didn't he,
when he was walking on his hands?

712
01:06:02,759 --> 01:06:05,720
Yeah. He could walk
faster on his hands.

713
01:06:06,847 --> 01:06:09,891
He could run faster on his hands than..

714
01:06:12,811 --> 01:06:14,187
Vecchio.

715
01:06:15,314 --> 01:06:16,564
Yeah.

716
01:06:18,233 --> 01:06:19,567
Caparzo.

717
01:06:26,074 --> 01:06:30,995
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men,

718
01:06:31,872 --> 01:06:34,999
you tell yourself it happened

719
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:40,713
so you could save the lives
of two or three or 10 others.

720
01:06:42,382 --> 01:06:44,425
Maybe 100 others.

721
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:51,599
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

722
01:06:51,683 --> 01:06:53,935
- How many?
- Ninety-four.

723
01:06:55,312 --> 01:07:01,108
But that means I've saved the lives
of 10 times that many, doesn't it?

724
01:07:02,069 --> 01:07:05,488
Maybe even 20, right?
Twenty times as many?

725
01:07:11,620 --> 01:07:13,955
And that's how simple it is.

726
01:07:14,873 --> 01:07:16,582
That's how you..

727
01:07:17,918 --> 01:07:20,586
That's how you rationalise
making the choice

728
01:07:20,671 --> 01:07:23,172
between the mission and the men.

729
01:07:23,632 --> 01:07:26,717
Except this time, the mission is a man.

730
01:07:30,013 --> 01:07:32,473
This Ryan better be worth it.

731
01:07:35,477 --> 01:07:38,271
He'd better go home,
cure some disease,

732
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:41,857
or invent a longer-lasting
light bulb or something.

733
01:07:42,651 --> 01:07:44,360
'Cause the truth is
I wouldn't trade 10 Ryans

734
01:07:44,444 --> 01:07:47,238
for one Vecchio or one Caparzo.

735
01:07:47,322 --> 01:07:48,656
Amen.

736
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,160
Look. There it goes again.

737
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:57,164
Sir, are you all right?

738
01:08:02,421 --> 01:08:05,715
Now, look, we're gonna
move out in two hours.

739
01:08:05,799 --> 01:08:08,092
Why don't you get some sleep?

740
01:08:08,176 --> 01:08:11,220
- I don't know how he does it.
- What's that?

741
01:08:11,305 --> 01:08:13,973
Falls asleep like that.
I mean, look at him.

742
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:17,101
The guy's lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

743
01:08:17,185 --> 01:08:18,769
Clear conscience.

744
01:08:18,854 --> 01:08:20,438
Yeah. What's that saying?

745
01:08:20,522 --> 01:08:23,691
"If God's on our side,
who the hell could be on theirs?"

746
01:08:23,775 --> 01:08:26,360
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

747
01:08:26,445 --> 01:08:28,571
Yeah, what did I say?

748
01:08:28,655 --> 01:08:32,908
Well, actually, the trick to falling
asleep is trying to stay awake.

749
01:08:32,993 --> 01:08:34,785
How is that, Wade?

750
01:08:34,870 --> 01:08:39,832
Well, when my mother was an intern,
she used to work late through the night,

751
01:08:39,916 --> 01:08:42,460
sleep through the day.

752
01:08:42,544 --> 01:08:44,378
So the only time that we ever got
to talk about anything

753
01:08:44,463 --> 01:08:45,921
was when she'd get home.

754
01:08:46,006 --> 01:08:48,549
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

755
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:50,134
and try to stay awake as long as I could,

756
01:08:50,218 --> 01:08:53,971
but it never worked
'cause the harder I tried,

757
01:08:54,056 --> 01:08:56,265
the faster I'd fall asleep.

758
01:08:57,642 --> 01:08:59,477
Yeah. Well, that wouldn't have
mattered none in my house.

759
01:08:59,561 --> 01:09:01,854
My ma, she would've come home,
shook me awake,

760
01:09:01,938 --> 01:09:03,773
chatted me up till dawn.

761
01:09:04,232 --> 01:09:06,400
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

762
01:09:06,485 --> 01:09:10,488
Yeah. That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

763
01:09:14,534 --> 01:09:18,079
Funny thing is,
sometimes she'd come home early,

764
01:09:18,163 --> 01:09:20,831
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

765
01:09:20,916 --> 01:09:24,543
- Who? Your mum?
- Yeah.

766
01:09:27,255 --> 01:09:30,257
She'd stand in the doorway,
looking at me.

767
01:09:30,717 --> 01:09:33,135
And I'd just keep my eyes shut.

768
01:09:35,931 --> 01:09:39,517
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

769
01:09:40,102 --> 01:09:42,561
that she came home early

770
01:09:43,980 --> 01:09:45,940
just to talk to me.

771
01:09:49,152 --> 01:09:53,364
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to just be asleep.

772
01:10:00,580 --> 01:10:02,873
I don't know why I did that.

773
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:20,015
We only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

774
01:10:28,817 --> 01:10:31,652
Captain? Sir?

775
01:10:33,697 --> 01:10:35,156
Corporal?

776
01:10:40,370 --> 01:10:43,456
How you doing there? Are you all right?

777
01:10:43,623 --> 01:10:46,625
Yeah, I think this is
all good for me, sir.

778
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,503
Really?

779
01:10:50,255 --> 01:10:51,755
How is that?

780
01:10:55,677 --> 01:10:58,220
"War educates the senses,"

781
01:10:58,305 --> 01:11:00,264
"calls into action the will,"

782
01:11:00,348 --> 01:11:03,058
"perfects the physical constitution,"

783
01:11:03,435 --> 01:11:06,312
"brings men into such swift
and close collision"

784
01:11:06,396 --> 01:11:09,523
"in critical moments
that man measures man."

785
01:11:09,983 --> 01:11:12,693
Yeah. Well, I guess
that's Emerson's way

786
01:11:13,153 --> 01:11:14,945
of finding the bright side.

787
01:11:15,030 --> 01:11:18,699
- You know Emerson, sir?
- I know some.

788
01:11:23,163 --> 01:11:27,208
So, where are you from, Captain?
What'd you do before the war?

789
01:11:29,211 --> 01:11:31,545
What's the pool up to?

790
01:11:34,883 --> 01:11:37,718
You know, I think it's around 300, sir.

791
01:11:38,553 --> 01:11:41,222
Well, when it gets up to 500,

792
01:11:41,306 --> 01:11:43,557
I'll give you the answers,
and we'll split the money.

793
01:11:43,642 --> 01:11:45,643
How about that?

794
01:11:45,727 --> 01:11:49,313
Well, if that's the way you feel, sir.
I feel it's my duty under your command

795
01:11:49,397 --> 01:11:53,651
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1,000, sir.

796
01:11:55,362 --> 01:11:57,863
What if we don't live that long?

797
01:12:01,034 --> 01:12:04,119
- 500?
- 500 would be good, yeah.

798
01:12:04,204 --> 01:12:06,163
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

799
01:12:08,792 --> 01:12:11,544
- Get some sleep, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

800
01:13:18,153 --> 01:13:20,362
Who's got sulfa powder?

801
01:13:22,741 --> 01:13:26,910
Medic! My buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet!

802
01:13:26,995 --> 01:13:28,495
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

803
01:13:28,580 --> 01:13:30,539
- See what you can do.
- Yes, sir.

804
01:13:30,624 --> 01:13:33,959
Hold on, fellas. It won't be much longer.

805
01:13:34,127 --> 01:13:36,003
How we doing here?

806
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:37,921
All right.

807
01:13:38,006 --> 01:13:40,549
Yeah, doing all right.
Don't worry about it.

808
01:13:40,634 --> 01:13:42,384
Doc's in town.

809
01:13:42,844 --> 01:13:43,927
It's all right. It's all right.

810
01:13:44,012 --> 01:13:45,512
Don't worry, fellas.

811
01:13:45,597 --> 01:13:48,140
The 29th Infantry's breaking through,
they'll be here soon.

812
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,601
Plasma. Anybody got plasma?

813
01:13:50,685 --> 01:13:54,521
- Captain. Hey, Captain.
- Soldier, you want to fill me in?

814
01:13:54,606 --> 01:13:56,565
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt, sir.

815
01:13:56,650 --> 01:14:00,277
99th Troop Carrier Squadron,
carrying in 327th Glider Infantry.

816
01:14:00,362 --> 01:14:01,945
This one was mine, sir.

817
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:03,447
- I was the pilot.
- Private?

818
01:14:03,531 --> 01:14:05,032
- Twenty-two men dead.
- Private, take care of..

819
01:14:05,116 --> 01:14:07,951
I ended up over there without a scratch.
It took my co-pilot's head right off.

820
01:14:08,036 --> 01:14:09,662
Well, where's the unit?
Who are these people?

821
01:14:09,746 --> 01:14:12,748
Well, the guys we came in with, sir,
they headed off first night.

822
01:14:12,832 --> 01:14:14,124
Haven't seen them since.

823
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:18,253
Meantime, other guys keep showing up,
one, two, half-dozen at a time.

824
01:14:18,338 --> 01:14:21,131
Then some officer'll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

825
01:14:21,216 --> 01:14:23,676
- head off to make trouble, sir.
- Water. I need a canteen over here.

826
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,761
We're looking for a Private James Ryan.

827
01:14:25,845 --> 01:14:28,097
He's in Baker Company,
the 506 of the 101 st.

828
01:14:28,181 --> 01:14:30,516
No, you got me, sir.
A lot of guys come in and out of here.

829
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,059
- Upham.
- Yes, sir.

830
01:14:32,143 --> 01:14:33,977
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

831
01:14:34,062 --> 01:14:35,729
Yes, sir.

832
01:14:37,107 --> 01:14:38,565
Reiben.

833
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:43,112
Smell that leg right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

834
01:14:48,743 --> 01:14:50,077
What?

835
01:14:55,542 --> 01:14:56,917
Keep moving.

836
01:14:57,001 --> 01:14:58,877
Keep moving!

837
01:14:59,796 --> 01:15:02,172
I'm Juden, you know?

838
01:15:04,426 --> 01:15:07,010
Yeah, I couldn't pry him out of there,
hard as I tried.

839
01:15:07,095 --> 01:15:09,304
- I'd need a winch.
- Yeah.

840
01:15:13,435 --> 01:15:14,727
Stars.

841
01:15:15,103 --> 01:15:19,648
Yep, Brigadier General Amend,
Deputy Commander, 101 st.

842
01:15:20,483 --> 01:15:23,026
Some fucking genius had the great idea

843
01:15:23,111 --> 01:15:24,653
of welding a couple of steel plates

844
01:15:24,738 --> 01:15:28,031
onto our deck to keep
the general safe from ground fire.

845
01:15:28,116 --> 01:15:29,700
Unfortunately,
they forgot to tell me about it

846
01:15:29,784 --> 01:15:32,202
until we were just getting airborne.

847
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:35,289
Well, that's like trying
to fly a freight train. Okay.

848
01:15:35,915 --> 01:15:39,293
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

849
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,671
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

850
01:15:42,756 --> 01:15:44,882
And when we released,

851
01:15:44,966 --> 01:15:47,259
you know, I cut as hard as I could,

852
01:15:47,343 --> 01:15:50,846
tried to gain some altitude
and still keep her from stalling.

853
01:15:50,930 --> 01:15:55,100
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

854
01:15:57,270 --> 01:16:00,564
And the others, they stopped easy
enough okay though, you know?

855
01:16:00,648 --> 01:16:04,401
We were just.. We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

856
01:16:04,486 --> 01:16:06,320
The grass was wet.

857
01:16:07,155 --> 01:16:09,281
Downward slope and all.

858
01:16:09,991 --> 01:16:11,909
Twenty-two guys dead.

859
01:16:14,704 --> 01:16:18,207
- All that for a general?
- One man.

860
01:16:20,502 --> 01:16:23,754
- A lot of that going around.
- FUBAR.

861
01:16:24,339 --> 01:16:26,340
- FUBAR.
- FUBAR.

862
01:16:27,091 --> 01:16:28,509
FUBAR.

863
01:16:28,593 --> 01:16:30,719
You all got that right.

864
01:16:31,221 --> 01:16:33,138
Hey, I looked up "FUBAR"
in the German dictionary.

865
01:16:33,223 --> 01:16:34,264
There's no "FUBAR" in there.

866
01:16:34,349 --> 01:16:35,599
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

867
01:16:35,683 --> 01:16:38,268
There's more paratroops out there.
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

868
01:16:38,353 --> 01:16:39,770
Yes, sir.

869
01:16:39,854 --> 01:16:42,523
Oh, you might want
to check these out, sir.

870
01:16:42,607 --> 01:16:44,149
Dog tags.

871
01:16:44,234 --> 01:16:47,152
More than I really want to count, sir.

872
01:16:48,363 --> 01:16:51,198
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

873
01:16:51,366 --> 01:16:52,741
Jackson.

874
01:16:53,368 --> 01:16:56,203
- Start going through those.
- Yes, sir.

875
01:16:57,455 --> 01:16:59,039
I'll help.

876
01:17:01,251 --> 01:17:03,794
What do you think, Jackson?
Do you think that little prick's in there?

877
01:17:03,878 --> 01:17:06,880
Well, if he is, I'm gonna find him.
I bet that son of a bitch is here.

878
01:17:06,965 --> 01:17:08,882
I got big money saying
this guy's still alive.

879
01:17:08,967 --> 01:17:11,093
10 bucks says I nail him first.

880
01:17:11,177 --> 01:17:13,804
- Let's see who we got in here.
- You mugs don't stand a chance.

881
01:17:13,888 --> 01:17:15,764
All right, you think this little
shit bird is in here or what?

882
01:17:15,849 --> 01:17:17,558
Just keep looking.

883
01:17:18,017 --> 01:17:20,185
All right. Gary lanico.

884
01:17:20,270 --> 01:17:22,062
Ben Rubino. Mike Cessacchio.

885
01:17:22,146 --> 01:17:23,939
I swear.
All the guineas are buying it, huh?

886
01:17:24,023 --> 01:17:25,816
Oh, come on, not the right name.

887
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,902
Wee Willie Winkie,
that's a buddy of yours.

888
01:17:29,153 --> 01:17:31,530
We gotta find this prick.

889
01:17:35,869 --> 01:17:37,703
Where is this son of a bitch?

890
01:17:37,787 --> 01:17:40,330
Don't mix them up, Jackson, all right?
Keep them in your own fucking pile.

891
01:17:40,415 --> 01:17:42,749
How am I supposed to know
who we got?

892
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:45,502
Why don't you just shut up,
Reiben? All right.

893
01:17:45,587 --> 01:17:49,089
- Everybody be friends.
- Cranky there, huh?

894
01:17:50,216 --> 01:17:53,010
- I think I got a winner.
- What you talking about?

895
01:17:53,094 --> 01:17:54,553
Ryan.

896
01:17:54,762 --> 01:17:57,347
- Ryan.
- Take a look at that, Mellish.

897
01:17:57,891 --> 01:17:59,182
You know what?
You're a genius. You really are.

898
01:17:59,267 --> 01:18:01,101
R-I-E-N-N-E.

899
01:18:01,185 --> 01:18:03,145
That's Rienne and that's French.
All right.

900
01:18:03,229 --> 01:18:05,314
- You know what that means?
- It means nothing.

901
01:18:05,398 --> 01:18:07,357
- What beats three of a kind?
- I got shit here.

902
01:18:07,442 --> 01:18:11,153
- I got all guys from New York.
- I got a full house.

903
01:18:11,237 --> 01:18:13,363
- Do you need a hand with that?
- I got a full house.

904
01:18:13,448 --> 01:18:14,729
I got you beat. I got
the straight flush.

905
01:18:14,742 --> 01:18:16,033
Full house, he's got.

906
01:18:16,117 --> 01:18:19,494
You were looking at my tags.
You're cheating, you know?

907
01:18:19,579 --> 01:18:21,705
- Ryan.
- Fucking unreal, this guy.

908
01:18:21,789 --> 01:18:24,374
Do you need a hand with that?
Can you read that shit?

909
01:18:24,459 --> 01:18:27,044
Jesus Christ. Look at this poor bastard.

910
01:18:27,128 --> 01:18:30,213
- I guess they're not bullet-proof, huh?
- Guess not. All right?

911
01:18:30,298 --> 01:18:31,715
I don't like
what he's got between his ears.

912
01:18:31,799 --> 01:18:34,718
Sort of like what you fellas got
between your legs.

913
01:18:34,802 --> 01:18:36,887
- We got to give him that.
- That's not bad.

914
01:18:36,971 --> 01:18:38,472
Not bad with you, Jackson.

915
01:18:38,556 --> 01:18:40,557
All right, I got three of a kind.
All right.

916
01:18:40,642 --> 01:18:41,808
- Full house.
- What the hell are you doing?

917
01:18:41,893 --> 01:18:44,394
The whole goddamn
Airborne's watching.

918
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,938
These aren't poker chips.

919
01:18:46,022 --> 01:18:49,858
- All right, all right, all right.
- Put them back in there!

920
01:19:13,383 --> 01:19:15,050
He's not here.

921
01:19:19,514 --> 01:19:21,890
Maybe we should bust up
into a couple of different groups, huh?

922
01:19:22,016 --> 01:19:23,225
And wander the woods
like Hansel and Gretel,

923
01:19:23,351 --> 01:19:24,393
calling his name.

924
01:19:24,519 --> 01:19:27,646
He's bound to hear us sooner
or later. Ryan!

925
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:30,899
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

926
01:19:31,609 --> 01:19:34,861
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Hey, you know..

927
01:19:38,199 --> 01:19:40,701
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101 st Airborne?

928
01:19:40,785 --> 01:19:44,579
Ryan? You know a guy named Ryan?
Private James Ryan from Iowa?

929
01:19:44,706 --> 01:19:46,707
Anybody know a Ryan?

930
01:19:47,208 --> 01:19:49,126
James Ryan!

931
01:19:49,210 --> 01:19:55,173
Hey, Joe, doesn't Mandelsohn pal
around with a Ryan from C Company?

932
01:19:55,258 --> 01:19:58,552
- Yeah. I think so.
- Bring him up here, would you?

933
01:20:07,895 --> 01:20:10,439
- Do you know Private Ryan?
- You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

934
01:20:10,565 --> 01:20:11,732
You're gonna have to speak up, sir.

935
01:20:11,816 --> 01:20:13,483
- My hearing is not good!
- It comes and goes!

936
01:20:13,568 --> 01:20:14,776
- It comes and goes!
- A German grenade went off

937
01:20:14,902 --> 01:20:16,695
- next to his ear.
- A grenade went off right by my head!

938
01:20:16,779 --> 01:20:19,823
Got it, got it. Do you know Private Ryan?

939
01:20:19,907 --> 01:20:21,366
Who?

940
01:20:21,451 --> 01:20:23,910
Private Ryan! James Ryan!

941
01:20:23,995 --> 01:20:28,206
- Jimmy Ryan?
- James! James Francis Ryan!

942
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:32,127
- No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.
- All right. Get me a pencil.

943
01:20:32,253 --> 01:20:34,546
Something to write on.
Something to write on.

944
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:37,132
Quick! Quick! Come on, a pencil!

945
01:20:38,926 --> 01:20:40,677
A small one, sir.

946
01:20:41,304 --> 01:20:42,429
Write this down.

947
01:20:42,513 --> 01:20:44,473
James Francis Ryan, question mark.

948
01:20:44,599 --> 01:20:46,349
Iowa, question mark.

949
01:20:46,434 --> 01:20:48,935
Do you know him? Does he know him?

950
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:51,104
Read the message. Look.

951
01:20:52,940 --> 01:20:56,943
- Yeah. Of course I know him, sir.
- Does he know where he is?

952
01:21:00,782 --> 01:21:04,159
Yeah, yeah. We missed
our drop zone by about 20 miles,

953
01:21:04,285 --> 01:21:07,579
ended up way over
by Bumville or some damn place.

954
01:21:07,663 --> 01:21:10,791
Him, me and a couple of other guys
were coming here to the rally point,

955
01:21:10,875 --> 01:21:16,046
ran into a Colonel who was gathering
up men to go to Ramelle.

956
01:21:16,380 --> 01:21:17,464
Ramelle.

957
01:21:17,548 --> 01:21:20,008
To baby-sit a bridge.
That's the last I've seen of him, sir.

958
01:21:20,134 --> 01:21:22,010
Great! Great! Thank you.

959
01:21:22,136 --> 01:21:24,387
Write thank.. Read, and thank you.

960
01:21:24,472 --> 01:21:26,973
- You're welcome!
- Assemble on me.

961
01:21:29,143 --> 01:21:31,144
Thank you, Lieutenant.

962
01:21:33,731 --> 01:21:35,148
Ramelle.

963
01:21:36,692 --> 01:21:38,860
We're here. There.

964
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:44,574
Ramelle is on the Merderet River,
right here, just to the southwest of us.

965
01:21:44,659 --> 01:21:47,035
You know anything about this bridge
he was talking about, Captain?

966
01:21:47,161 --> 01:21:50,997
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

967
01:21:51,749 --> 01:21:55,252
We can't push on Paris
until we take a deep water port.

968
01:21:55,336 --> 01:21:57,129
And Rommel knows that,

969
01:21:57,213 --> 01:21:58,797
so he's gonna try to get his armour

970
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:02,259
across the Merderet river
anywhere he can.

971
01:22:02,343 --> 01:22:04,344
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

972
01:22:04,428 --> 01:22:07,097
when we make
the big right turn to Cherbourg.

973
01:22:07,181 --> 01:22:08,890
That makes any village on that river

974
01:22:09,016 --> 01:22:12,269
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

975
01:22:32,957 --> 01:22:34,374
Let's go.

976
01:22:43,885 --> 01:22:45,218
Captain.

977
01:23:23,591 --> 01:23:25,550
What the hell is that?

978
01:23:26,761 --> 01:23:29,888
A radar site. It's gotta be out of action.

979
01:23:29,972 --> 01:23:34,768
Looks like we got something in that.
Sandbag bunker right under the station.

980
01:23:35,937 --> 01:23:38,813
- See it?
- Yeah. That's my guess, too.

981
01:23:40,233 --> 01:23:41,983
What is it?

982
01:23:42,652 --> 01:23:44,945
Machine gun. Probably MG42.

983
01:23:45,029 --> 01:23:47,322
Jesus. Is that what got those guys?

984
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:49,324
Maybe one of them's our boy.

985
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:52,827
No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

986
01:23:52,912 --> 01:23:54,996
Yeah, well, I don't know how fast
the rest of you betties are,

987
01:23:55,081 --> 01:23:57,582
but I'm thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

988
01:23:57,667 --> 01:24:00,710
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

989
01:24:00,795 --> 01:24:04,381
So, Captain, what I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

990
01:24:04,465 --> 01:24:07,884
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

991
01:24:09,512 --> 01:24:11,388
I'm with Reiben on this one, sir.

992
01:24:11,472 --> 01:24:15,600
- I mean, we left them 88s.
- For the Air Force.

993
01:24:15,685 --> 01:24:19,771
The Air Force isn't gonna spend
ordnance on one machine gun.

994
01:24:20,231 --> 01:24:21,690
Captain..

995
01:24:22,733 --> 01:24:24,567
We can still skip it
and accomplish our mission.

996
01:24:24,652 --> 01:24:27,654
I mean, this isn't our
mission, right, sir?

997
01:24:27,738 --> 01:24:29,948
Oh. That's what
you want to do, Mellish?

998
01:24:30,032 --> 01:24:31,491
You just want to leave it here,
so they can ambush

999
01:24:31,575 --> 01:24:32,867
the next company that comes along?

1000
01:24:32,952 --> 01:24:34,327
No, sir. That's not what I'm saying.

1001
01:24:34,412 --> 01:24:37,205
I'm simply saying
it seems like an unnecessary risk,

1002
01:24:37,290 --> 01:24:38,748
given our objective, sir.

1003
01:24:38,833 --> 01:24:41,584
Our objective is to win the war.

1004
01:24:44,797 --> 01:24:48,800
Sir, I just.. I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

1005
01:24:51,304 --> 01:24:55,015
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

1006
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:19,080
All right, three runners
with suppressing fire.

1007
01:25:19,206 --> 01:25:22,375
Mellish, you hook to the right.
I'll go up the middle.

1008
01:25:22,543 --> 01:25:32,469
Who's going left?

1009
01:25:36,891 --> 01:25:38,308
I'll do it.

1010
01:25:39,268 --> 01:25:41,853
- I'll go left.
- All right.

1011
01:25:41,937 --> 01:25:44,731
Upham, switch off with Jackson,
and you linger in the rear.

1012
01:25:44,815 --> 01:25:46,274
Yes, sir.

1013
01:25:46,984 --> 01:25:51,821
We advance and keep pressure on him
till he has to change out his barrels.

1014
01:25:52,656 --> 01:25:54,616
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1015
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:58,995
- Maybe I should go up the middle, sir.
- The way you run? I don't think so.

1016
01:25:59,080 --> 01:26:02,832
- Maybe I should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up.

1017
01:26:03,626 --> 01:26:06,002
Reiben, base of fire.

1018
01:26:14,387 --> 01:26:17,305
Mags and clips where
you can reach them, and..

1019
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:20,350
And extra grenades
for the base runners.

1020
01:27:45,019 --> 01:27:46,936
Hill's clear! Four down and dead!

1021
01:27:47,021 --> 01:27:52,025
Upham, grab the gear. Get up here!
We need water and extra dressing now!

1022
01:27:52,109 --> 01:27:57,822
Get the morphine out
of the extra medical kit!

1023
01:28:06,624 --> 01:28:07,665
God.

1024
01:28:08,334 --> 01:28:09,542
Son of a bitch!

1025
01:28:09,627 --> 01:28:10,877
All right. The sulfa.

1026
01:28:11,003 --> 01:28:12,629
- Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
- I got him.

1027
01:28:12,713 --> 01:28:14,297
- More sulfa, Mellish.
- I got him. I got him, Wade.

1028
01:28:14,381 --> 01:28:15,798
- You're gonna be all right.
- Listen to my voice.

1029
01:28:15,883 --> 01:28:17,133
You're gonna be all right, Doc.

1030
01:28:17,218 --> 01:28:18,801
How's it look? How's it look?

1031
01:28:18,886 --> 01:28:20,803
Wade, you're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

1032
01:28:20,888 --> 01:28:22,805
- More sulfa! More sulfa!
- Put my legs up.

1033
01:28:22,890 --> 01:28:25,141
- Put my legs up. Put my legs up.
- He's gonna be all right.

1034
01:28:25,226 --> 01:28:27,644
- I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em.
- You're gonna be okay, Wade.

1035
01:28:27,728 --> 01:28:29,062
I got 'em.

1036
01:28:29,188 --> 01:28:31,898
Upham, give me your canteen!

1037
01:28:32,024 --> 01:28:33,816
- Come on. Come on.
- ..we're gonna get you out of here.

1038
01:28:33,901 --> 01:28:34,984
Put some pressure on it.

1039
01:28:35,069 --> 01:28:37,946
- You're gonna be okay.
- How's it look?

1040
01:28:38,072 --> 01:28:39,822
- I'm getting some morphine.
- How's it look?

1041
01:28:39,907 --> 01:28:42,367
- It's all right. You're gonna be okay.
- How's it look?

1042
01:28:42,451 --> 01:28:44,160
You're gonna be okay.

1043
01:28:44,245 --> 01:28:46,120
Here comes the morphine.
Here comes the morphine.

1044
01:28:46,247 --> 01:28:49,249
Am I shot in the spine?

1045
01:28:49,375 --> 01:28:51,918
- You're okay, Wade.
- Am I shot in the spine?

1046
01:28:52,044 --> 01:28:54,087
- Lift him up. Easy, easy, easy.
- All right. Flip him over.

1047
01:28:54,213 --> 01:28:55,380
- Easy, easy, easy.
- Put some pressure.

1048
01:28:55,464 --> 01:28:58,049
- Easy, easy.
- Lift him up. Lift him up.

1049
01:29:00,594 --> 01:29:03,596
It's okay, doc. It's all right.

1050
01:29:03,722 --> 01:29:06,224
Wade, you got an exit wound.

1051
01:29:06,308 --> 01:29:08,059
It's in the small of your back.

1052
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:10,478
How big's the hole in the..

1053
01:29:10,604 --> 01:29:12,522
- About the size of an acorn.
- It's fine.

1054
01:29:12,606 --> 01:29:14,649
You're fine. You're fine.

1055
01:29:16,277 --> 01:29:20,154
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

1056
01:29:20,281 --> 01:29:24,450
- Put some pressure on it.
- It's all right.

1057
01:29:24,577 --> 01:29:27,287
Put some more pressure on it!

1058
01:29:27,788 --> 01:29:30,164
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1059
01:29:30,291 --> 01:29:32,041
Yeah, right here, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1060
01:29:32,126 --> 01:29:33,543
- No.
- Right here. Yeah. Right here.

1061
01:29:33,627 --> 01:29:35,253
I'm gonna put your hand on it.

1062
01:29:35,337 --> 01:29:37,130
- We got some pressure on there.
- Right there.

1063
01:29:37,256 --> 01:29:39,382
- That's good.
- Okay. That's the one.

1064
01:29:39,466 --> 01:29:41,259
Oh, my God, my liver!

1065
01:29:41,343 --> 01:29:44,262
- Oh, my God! It's my liver!
- Something wrong, Wade.

1066
01:29:44,346 --> 01:29:45,722
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1067
01:29:45,806 --> 01:29:47,682
What do you need? What do you need?
What can we do, Wade?

1068
01:29:47,808 --> 01:29:50,018
Tell us what to do.

1069
01:29:50,144 --> 01:29:51,394
Oh, shit.

1070
01:29:51,478 --> 01:29:55,982
I could use.. I could use
a little more morphine.

1071
01:29:56,692 --> 01:29:58,484
More morphine, sir?

1072
01:29:59,486 --> 01:30:01,946
Okay. Okay.

1073
01:30:05,618 --> 01:30:11,164
Give it to him.

1074
01:30:15,502 --> 01:30:18,212
- I don't wanna die.
- Here you go. Wade, here you go.

1075
01:30:18,339 --> 01:30:21,758
- Here it comes.
- There you go. There you..

1076
01:30:25,054 --> 01:30:27,013
Give him another one.

1077
01:30:34,104 --> 01:30:39,359
Mama?

1078
01:30:40,194 --> 01:30:43,112
I want to go home. I want to go home.

1079
01:30:44,740 --> 01:30:47,742
Mama. Mama.

1080
01:30:47,868 --> 01:30:50,703
Mama, Mama, Mama..

1081
01:31:33,497 --> 01:31:35,248
Reiben, hold him!

1082
01:31:55,978 --> 01:31:57,353
Not yet.

1083
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:03,943
First, make him mark and cover
Wade's body for grave detail.

1084
01:32:04,445 --> 01:32:07,447
Same thing
for those paratroopers down there.

1085
01:32:07,865 --> 01:32:10,324
Strip that stuff off
and check him for intelligence.

1086
01:32:10,409 --> 01:32:14,620
Ask this piece of shit
if he's the one who shot Wade. Ask him!

1087
01:32:14,705 --> 01:32:17,415
- It doesn't matter.
- It does matter!

1088
01:32:19,835 --> 01:32:22,420
Shut up with that filthy pig latin.

1089
01:32:24,506 --> 01:32:26,424
Jackson, you're hit.

1090
01:32:28,594 --> 01:32:29,844
Shit.

1091
01:32:30,429 --> 01:32:33,765
- I guess it just skinned the arm, sir.
- Get it cleaned and dressed.

1092
01:32:33,849 --> 01:32:36,392
You and Sarge, watch the perimeter.

1093
01:32:39,438 --> 01:32:43,983
- Sir, he says, "Please don't shoot."
- I don't care what he says, Upham.

1094
01:32:44,735 --> 01:32:47,779
Sir? Sir, you're gonna let them kill him?

1095
01:32:48,781 --> 01:32:53,034
- This is not right, sir.
- You can help him with the bodies.

1096
01:32:55,370 --> 01:32:57,205
What is happening?

1097
01:34:47,691 --> 01:34:49,066
American.

1098
01:34:50,986 --> 01:34:52,737
I like American.

1099
01:35:00,287 --> 01:35:04,206
Steamboat Willie.

1100
01:35:04,291 --> 01:35:06,959
Yeah, Steamboat Willie. American.

1101
01:35:18,472 --> 01:35:20,848
- He's says he's not finished.
- Yeah. That's what you think.

1102
01:35:20,933 --> 01:35:22,683
Come on. Yeah.

1103
01:35:32,611 --> 01:35:35,988
Please.. I like America.

1104
01:35:37,324 --> 01:35:39,533
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

1105
01:35:39,618 --> 01:35:43,287
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue? Cool beans!

1106
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,168
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1107
01:35:50,170 --> 01:35:52,964
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

1108
01:35:59,638 --> 01:36:04,850
I say can you see
I say can you see

1109
01:36:05,310 --> 01:36:07,436
I say..

1110
01:36:14,444 --> 01:36:19,740
Fuck Hitler.

1111
01:36:28,583 --> 01:36:31,168
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.

1112
01:36:31,253 --> 01:36:33,295
He says he's sorry about Wade, sir.

1113
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,047
Captain.

1114
01:36:35,173 --> 01:36:37,049
Captain, this isn't right.

1115
01:36:37,134 --> 01:36:40,678
You know this. He's a prisoner.
He surrendered.

1116
01:36:41,388 --> 01:36:43,347
He surrendered, sir!

1117
01:36:54,026 --> 01:36:55,735
Tell him

1118
01:36:57,738 --> 01:37:01,073
to march 1,000 paces in that direction,

1119
01:37:01,199 --> 01:37:02,408
then he can take off the blindfold.

1120
01:37:02,534 --> 01:37:03,576
We'll be gone, and he turns himself in

1121
01:37:03,702 --> 01:37:05,494
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1122
01:37:05,579 --> 01:37:06,579
- Thank you, sir.
- You gotta be kidding me.

1123
01:37:06,705 --> 01:37:09,498
- We're letting him go?
- He's a POW, Reiben.

1124
01:37:09,583 --> 01:37:13,919
Can't take him with us.
Our guys'll pick him up sooner or later.

1125
01:37:24,598 --> 01:37:26,849
Only if he doesn't get picked up
by his own Wehrmacht first,

1126
01:37:26,933 --> 01:37:29,602
then thrown back into circulation.

1127
01:37:31,772 --> 01:37:34,190
Captain, you just let the enemy go.

1128
01:37:34,274 --> 01:37:37,193
- This is such bullshit.
- Y'all got that right.

1129
01:37:37,277 --> 01:37:39,278
Bullshit? Right. This is bullshit?

1130
01:37:39,404 --> 01:37:41,447
- Shooting a prisoner, that'd be okay?
- Upham, shut your mouth.

1131
01:37:41,573 --> 01:37:42,615
It's against the goddamn rules!

1132
01:37:42,741 --> 01:37:46,786
Yeah. The goddamn rules
just walked off with your new friend.

1133
01:37:48,705 --> 01:37:52,958
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, huh, Captain?

1134
01:37:59,758 --> 01:38:02,093
Get your gear. Let's go.

1135
01:38:04,554 --> 01:38:06,639
You heard him. Gear up.

1136
01:38:07,974 --> 01:38:09,809
The Captain just gave you an order.

1137
01:38:09,893 --> 01:38:13,729
Yeah. Like the one he gave
to take this machine gun.

1138
01:38:13,814 --> 01:38:16,941
- That was a real doozy, wasn't it, Sarge.
- Soldier, you are way out of line.

1139
01:38:17,025 --> 01:38:20,277
Yes, sir. That was one hell of a call,
coming to take this nest,

1140
01:38:20,362 --> 01:38:23,114
but what the hell? We only lost
one of our guys, going for it.

1141
01:38:23,198 --> 01:38:25,533
I swear, I hope Mama Ryan's
real fucking happy,

1142
01:38:25,659 --> 01:38:27,419
knowing that little
Jimmy's life is a little

1143
01:38:27,432 --> 01:38:29,203
bit more important
than two of our guys!

1144
01:38:29,329 --> 01:38:32,289
But then again, we haven't
found him yet, have we? Huh?

1145
01:38:34,334 --> 01:38:35,709
- Here you go.
- Get the hell off me!

1146
01:38:35,836 --> 01:38:37,545
Reiben, get up.

1147
01:38:39,339 --> 01:38:42,466
Gear up. Fall in.

1148
01:38:47,514 --> 01:38:49,723
I'm done with this mission.

1149
01:38:54,688 --> 01:38:56,355
Hey! Hey!

1150
01:38:58,316 --> 01:39:00,359
- Sir.
- Don't walk away from your Captain.

1151
01:39:00,485 --> 01:39:02,736
- Reiben, get back in line.
- No, sir.

1152
01:39:02,863 --> 01:39:04,196
I'll spend the rest
of my life in the stockade

1153
01:39:04,322 --> 01:39:05,614
if I have to, but I'm done with this.

1154
01:39:05,699 --> 01:39:07,992
- I'm not gonna ask you again, soldier.
- Captain!

1155
01:39:08,076 --> 01:39:09,410
All right, now. This is bullshit!

1156
01:39:09,536 --> 01:39:11,996
- Fall in!
- You're gonna shoot me over Ryan?

1157
01:39:12,080 --> 01:39:13,455
No. I'm gonna shoot you
'cause I don't like you.

1158
01:39:13,540 --> 01:39:16,500
- Sir, listen..
- Sir, if he wants to go, just let him go!

1159
01:39:16,585 --> 01:39:19,920
Are you letting this happen?
Captain! You see this?

1160
01:39:20,046 --> 01:39:23,090
- Captain? Sir? Sir, Ryan's dead.
- Bullshit!

1161
01:39:23,216 --> 01:39:25,634
- Sir, we have a situation you might..
- That is bullshit!

1162
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:28,220
Captain, I have a sixth sense about
these things. I know it in my bones.

1163
01:39:28,346 --> 01:39:31,223
We don't kill that son-of-a-bitch kraut.
Now you're gonna shoot me?

1164
01:39:31,349 --> 01:39:33,767
- He's better than you.
- Then why don't you just do it, Sarge?

1165
01:39:33,894 --> 01:39:35,561
Do it, man. Put one in my leg
and give me that..

1166
01:39:35,645 --> 01:39:38,314
I'm gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1167
01:39:38,398 --> 01:39:39,815
Well, put your money
where your mouth is..

1168
01:39:39,900 --> 01:39:41,317
- You don't know when to shut up.
- Do it!

1169
01:39:41,401 --> 01:39:42,985
- You don't know how to shut up.
- Pull the trigger, already!

1170
01:39:43,069 --> 01:39:44,403
Captain, please!

1171
01:39:44,529 --> 01:39:47,740
- What's the pool on me up to?
- What?

1172
01:39:47,866 --> 01:39:50,576
- You are a coward son of a bitch!
- I'm waiting, Sarge.

1173
01:39:50,660 --> 01:39:54,330
Mike, what's the pool
on me up to right now?

1174
01:39:54,414 --> 01:39:56,207
What's it up to?

1175
01:39:56,833 --> 01:40:01,420
What is it, $300? Is that it? 300?
I'm a schoolteacher.

1176
01:40:06,009 --> 01:40:08,260
I teach English composition

1177
01:40:09,596 --> 01:40:11,764
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1178
01:40:11,848 --> 01:40:13,599
The last 11 years,

1179
01:40:14,434 --> 01:40:17,436
I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1180
01:40:19,356 --> 01:40:23,025
I was the coach of the baseball team
in the springtime.

1181
01:40:25,570 --> 01:40:27,238
I'll be doggone.

1182
01:40:27,948 --> 01:40:31,200
Back home, when I'd tell people
what I do for a living,

1183
01:40:31,284 --> 01:40:34,203
they'd think, "Well, that figures."

1184
01:40:36,081 --> 01:40:38,290
But over here, it's a..

1185
01:40:39,918 --> 01:40:41,585
A big..

1186
01:40:42,837 --> 01:40:44,505
A big mystery.

1187
01:40:45,548 --> 01:40:48,259
So I guess I've changed some.

1188
01:40:50,971 --> 01:40:54,139
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much

1189
01:40:54,224 --> 01:40:58,769
my wife is even going to recognise me
whenever it is I get back to her.

1190
01:41:00,313 --> 01:41:02,856
And how I'll ever be able to..

1191
01:41:05,402 --> 01:41:08,028
To tell her about days like today.

1192
01:41:11,283 --> 01:41:12,658
Ryan..

1193
01:41:13,743 --> 01:41:16,912
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

1194
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:21,250
The man means nothing to me,
it's just a name. But if..

1195
01:41:23,086 --> 01:41:25,587
You know, if going to Ramelle

1196
01:41:25,714 --> 01:41:27,256
and finding him, so he can go home,

1197
01:41:27,340 --> 01:41:28,966
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife

1198
01:41:29,050 --> 01:41:33,345
well, then.. Then that's my mission.

1199
01:41:35,390 --> 01:41:36,974
You want to leave?

1200
01:41:37,058 --> 01:41:40,102
You want to go off and fight the war?

1201
01:41:42,981 --> 01:41:44,440
All right.

1202
01:41:45,775 --> 01:41:48,319
All right, I won't stop you.

1203
01:41:48,403 --> 01:41:50,988
I'll even put in the paperwork.

1204
01:41:52,949 --> 01:41:57,328
I just know that every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

1205
01:43:22,539 --> 01:43:24,123
By memories

1206
01:43:25,458 --> 01:43:27,501
Of the days gone by

1207
01:43:29,337 --> 01:43:31,130
In my solitude

1208
01:43:32,048 --> 01:43:34,508
You taunt me

1209
01:43:34,592 --> 01:43:38,137
With memories that never die

1210
01:43:39,347 --> 01:43:41,807
I sit in my chair

1211
01:43:41,891 --> 01:43:44,101
Filled with despair

1212
01:43:44,185 --> 01:43:46,019
There's no one

1213
01:43:46,104 --> 01:43:48,522
Could be so sad

1214
01:43:49,399 --> 01:43:51,442
With gloom everywhere

1215
01:43:51,526 --> 01:43:54,153
I sit and I stare..

1216
01:44:08,042 --> 01:44:10,127
Half track! Cover!

1217
01:44:25,810 --> 01:44:29,354
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

1218
01:44:50,251 --> 01:44:52,628
Get ready to move on their left flank!
Take their left flank!

1219
01:44:52,712 --> 01:44:55,589
Hold on and make sure they're down!

1220
01:45:16,736 --> 01:45:19,363
101 st! We're coming out!

1221
01:45:26,788 --> 01:45:29,748
That was a recon element, 2nd SS.

1222
01:45:31,084 --> 01:45:34,670
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1223
01:45:36,548 --> 01:45:39,967
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1224
01:45:40,051 --> 01:45:42,135
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501 st.

1225
01:45:42,220 --> 01:45:43,720
Ryan. First of the 506th.

1226
01:45:43,805 --> 01:45:46,181
PFC Toynbe, Third of the 506th.

1227
01:45:46,266 --> 01:45:48,225
James Francis Ryan?

1228
01:45:48,309 --> 01:45:50,811
Yes, sir. How'd you guess that?

1229
01:46:02,574 --> 01:46:05,534
Looks like you guys got hit pretty hard.

1230
01:46:05,618 --> 01:46:09,162
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

1231
01:46:11,583 --> 01:46:15,168
They came in,
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1232
01:46:21,384 --> 01:46:24,928
Tell you what, sir, if you're our relief,
I'm gonna file a complaint.

1233
01:46:25,013 --> 01:46:26,972
I wouldn't blame you.

1234
01:46:27,724 --> 01:46:29,474
Who's your CO?

1235
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:33,854
It would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1236
01:46:33,938 --> 01:46:38,400
I'm afraid the best we can muster up
right now is a corporal.

1237
01:46:38,484 --> 01:46:41,028
So, what are you guys all about?

1238
01:46:41,613 --> 01:46:44,114
We're here for him. Ryan.

1239
01:46:45,450 --> 01:46:46,908
Me, sir?

1240
01:46:56,252 --> 01:46:58,629
James Francis Ryan of Iowa?

1241
01:46:59,464 --> 01:47:02,924
Yes, sir.
Payton, Iowa, that's correct, but..

1242
01:47:03,009 --> 01:47:05,010
What is this about?

1243
01:47:06,846 --> 01:47:09,640
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1244
01:47:16,439 --> 01:47:18,065
Which ones?

1245
01:47:20,985 --> 01:47:22,486
All of them.

1246
01:47:32,372 --> 01:47:33,955
On the level?

1247
01:47:35,375 --> 01:47:37,334
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

1248
01:47:40,088 --> 01:47:42,047
You might want to take
some time with this.

1249
01:47:42,131 --> 01:47:45,175
If there's someplace
you want to go and..

1250
01:47:54,185 --> 01:47:57,104
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1251
01:47:57,188 --> 01:47:59,564
- Which one?
- All of them.

1252
01:48:04,529 --> 01:48:05,904
You..

1253
01:48:08,533 --> 01:48:11,827
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1254
01:48:13,538 --> 01:48:15,706
Well, you're going home.

1255
01:48:17,208 --> 01:48:19,793
Our orders are to bring you back.

1256
01:48:23,089 --> 01:48:24,715
Bring me back?

1257
01:48:27,093 --> 01:48:30,595
Corporal Henderson, I don't mean
to leave you even more shorthanded,

1258
01:48:30,680 --> 01:48:32,013
but orders are orders.

1259
01:48:32,098 --> 01:48:34,933
Any communication about when
you're going to be relieved up here?

1260
01:48:35,059 --> 01:48:36,268
Sir, there's no way to tell. I mean,

1261
01:48:36,394 --> 01:48:37,936
we have no idea
what's happening south of us.

1262
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:39,354
I have my orders, too, sir.

1263
01:48:39,439 --> 01:48:41,356
They don't include me
abandoning my post.

1264
01:48:41,441 --> 01:48:44,359
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1265
01:48:44,444 --> 01:48:46,778
I don't see that it does, sir.

1266
01:48:48,406 --> 01:48:51,450
The Chief of Staff
for the United States Army says it does.

1267
01:48:51,534 --> 01:48:54,369
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1268
01:48:54,454 --> 01:48:56,955
Now, our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1269
01:48:57,081 --> 01:48:59,040
across the Merderet
with the exception of two.

1270
01:48:59,125 --> 01:49:00,709
One at Valognes and this one here.

1271
01:49:00,793 --> 01:49:02,043
We let the Germans take them,

1272
01:49:02,128 --> 01:49:03,712
we're gonna lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1273
01:49:03,796 --> 01:49:07,299
Private, your outfit wants to stay,
that's one thing.

1274
01:49:07,383 --> 01:49:08,467
But your party's over here.

1275
01:49:08,551 --> 01:49:10,719
Sir, I can't leave
until at least reinforcements..

1276
01:49:10,803 --> 01:49:13,221
You got three minutes
to gather your gear.

1277
01:49:13,306 --> 01:49:15,390
Sir, what about them?
I mean, there's barely hardly enough..

1278
01:49:15,475 --> 01:49:16,975
Hey, asshole!

1279
01:49:17,727 --> 01:49:21,605
Two of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1280
01:49:26,652 --> 01:49:29,321
- Sir?
- That's right.

1281
01:49:39,207 --> 01:49:43,710
- What were their names?
- Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1282
01:49:45,671 --> 01:49:47,214
Wade and..

1283
01:49:48,716 --> 01:49:50,175
Caparzo.

1284
01:50:02,563 --> 01:50:04,981
It doesn't make any sense.

1285
01:50:07,068 --> 01:50:11,321
It doesn't make sense, sir.
Why? Why do I deserve to go?

1286
01:50:11,405 --> 01:50:15,575
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard as me!

1287
01:50:19,205 --> 01:50:22,290
Is that what they're
supposed to tell your mother

1288
01:50:22,375 --> 01:50:25,710
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1289
01:50:32,927 --> 01:50:35,345
Tell her that when you found me,

1290
01:50:35,429 --> 01:50:39,099
I was here and I was
with the only brothers that I have left,

1291
01:50:39,225 --> 01:50:42,435
and that there's no way
I was gonna desert them.

1292
01:50:43,604 --> 01:50:45,772
I think she'll understand that.

1293
01:50:45,898 --> 01:50:48,859
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1294
01:51:31,861 --> 01:51:33,945
What are your orders?

1295
01:51:35,781 --> 01:51:39,117
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1296
01:51:40,119 --> 01:51:42,704
The world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1297
01:51:42,788 --> 01:51:45,624
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1298
01:51:46,292 --> 01:51:49,294
I don't know. What do you think?

1299
01:51:50,338 --> 01:51:53,131
You don't want to know what I think.

1300
01:51:55,009 --> 01:51:56,676
No, Mike, I do.

1301
01:51:58,387 --> 01:52:01,681
Well, part of me thinks the kid's right.

1302
01:52:01,807 --> 01:52:04,309
What's he done to deserve this?

1303
01:52:04,393 --> 01:52:08,355
He wants to stay here, fine,
let's leave him and go home.

1304
01:52:09,649 --> 01:52:10,899
Yeah.

1305
01:52:11,484 --> 01:52:16,571
But another part of me thinks
what if, by some miracle, we stay

1306
01:52:16,656 --> 01:52:19,324
and actually make it out of here?

1307
01:52:20,201 --> 01:52:23,828
Someday we might look back on this
and decide that

1308
01:52:23,913 --> 01:52:27,332
saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1309
01:52:27,416 --> 01:52:30,335
we were able to pull out of this whole

1310
01:52:30,419 --> 01:52:32,545
God-awful, shitty mess.

1311
01:52:34,215 --> 01:52:36,716
That's what I was thinking, sir.

1312
01:52:37,885 --> 01:52:40,053
Like you said, Captain,

1313
01:52:41,847 --> 01:52:43,556
we do that,

1314
01:52:44,016 --> 01:52:46,851
we all earn the right to go home.

1315
01:52:49,689 --> 01:52:51,231
Oh, brother.

1316
01:52:54,694 --> 01:52:57,028
This is everything.

1317
01:52:57,738 --> 01:53:03,368
You got the two 30-calibre machine
guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1318
01:53:04,120 --> 01:53:07,455
You got the two bazookas,
but they only got eight rounds left,

1319
01:53:07,540 --> 01:53:09,749
and assorted small arms.

1320
01:53:09,875 --> 01:53:13,336
We had a 60 mortar
but an arty round took it out.

1321
01:53:13,421 --> 01:53:16,089
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1322
01:53:16,215 --> 01:53:19,426
- Which they're sure to do.
- What are you thinking, sir?

1323
01:53:19,552 --> 01:53:24,139
Well, I'm thinking they're going to try
to whip around the flanks.

1324
01:53:28,728 --> 01:53:30,979
Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1325
01:53:31,063 --> 01:53:32,188
in between these buildings

1326
01:53:32,273 --> 01:53:36,234
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1327
01:53:36,318 --> 01:53:38,361
- Disable 'em?
- If we can.

1328
01:53:38,446 --> 01:53:40,030
Make that tank a 60-ton roadblock.

1329
01:53:40,114 --> 01:53:41,948
We do that, we got
a fighting chance at their flanks.

1330
01:53:42,074 --> 01:53:44,451
Yes, sir that's good. Split them up.
Don't let them mass anywhere.

1331
01:53:44,577 --> 01:53:47,495
Hit them hard as we can, one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1332
01:53:47,580 --> 01:53:49,789
Machine gun on the move down here,
and number two up high somewhere

1333
01:53:49,915 --> 01:53:51,916
to piss a little bad news down
on their heads.

1334
01:53:52,001 --> 01:53:54,252
That would be the idea.

1335
01:53:54,795 --> 01:53:56,254
Jackson.

1336
01:53:56,922 --> 01:53:59,174
If we can, I'd like to get you up
in that bell tower.

1337
01:53:59,258 --> 01:54:00,768
Yes, sir.

1338
01:54:00,781 --> 01:54:02,302
Give you a little
company if you need it.

1339
01:54:02,428 --> 01:54:04,429
Yes, sir. Some company couldn't hurt.

1340
01:54:04,513 --> 01:54:08,558
I'd say a .30 with about
1,000 rounds would be okay.

1341
01:54:08,642 --> 01:54:10,685
Parker, job opportunity.

1342
01:54:10,770 --> 01:54:12,771
Yeah. Well, it's not the worst idea
ever, Captain.

1343
01:54:12,855 --> 01:54:14,439
It's just that everything depends
on getting the tank

1344
01:54:14,523 --> 01:54:16,608
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1345
01:54:16,776 --> 01:54:19,778
So how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1346
01:54:20,279 --> 01:54:23,198
Reiben's right. As our esteemed
colleague from the Airborne pointed out,

1347
01:54:23,282 --> 01:54:25,575
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1348
01:54:25,659 --> 01:54:29,496
so how do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1349
01:54:29,622 --> 01:54:31,998
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1350
01:54:32,124 --> 01:54:35,251
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1351
01:54:35,336 --> 01:54:37,462
Yeah, but with what?

1352
01:54:39,131 --> 01:54:42,967
- Well, we could try a sticky bomb.
- Sticky bomb, sir?

1353
01:54:44,178 --> 01:54:48,014
- Sir, are you making that up?
- No. It's in the field manual.

1354
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:49,974
You check it out if you want to.

1355
01:54:50,059 --> 01:54:52,143
We seem to be out of field manuals, sir.

1356
01:54:52,228 --> 01:54:54,145
Perhaps you can enlighten us?

1357
01:54:54,230 --> 01:54:55,688
All right, you have
some demolition, don't you?

1358
01:54:55,815 --> 01:54:57,732
Some TNT or some composition B?

1359
01:54:57,817 --> 01:54:59,526
Yeah, that, sir, is the one thing
we got plenty of.

1360
01:54:59,652 --> 01:55:02,278
I got that bridge wired with enough
composition B to blow it twice.

1361
01:55:02,363 --> 01:55:04,364
All right. You can spare some, then.

1362
01:55:04,490 --> 01:55:07,700
You take a standard-issue GI sock,

1363
01:55:07,827 --> 01:55:10,912
cram it with as much
comp B as it can hold,

1364
01:55:10,996 --> 01:55:13,456
rig up a simple fuse,

1365
01:55:13,541 --> 01:55:16,084
then you coat the whole thing
with axle grease.

1366
01:55:16,168 --> 01:55:20,672
That way, when you throw it,
it should stick. It's a bomb that sticks.

1367
01:55:20,756 --> 01:55:22,382
It's a sticky bomb.

1368
01:55:22,508 --> 01:55:24,884
You come up with a better way
to knock the tracks off a tank,

1369
01:55:25,010 --> 01:55:26,594
I'm all ears.

1370
01:55:26,679 --> 01:55:30,223
This is good.
Now we got to surrender our socks.

1371
01:55:44,697 --> 01:55:46,197
Haul away.

1372
01:56:00,212 --> 01:56:04,132
All right, select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1373
01:56:04,216 --> 01:56:07,552
All right, I can cover
12 to nine from here.

1374
01:56:10,764 --> 01:56:12,891
- Easy!
- I got her!

1375
01:56:47,259 --> 01:56:49,093
Here are the mines.

1376
01:57:00,022 --> 01:57:02,440
For being the best we can do,

1377
01:57:02,524 --> 01:57:06,527
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1378
01:57:09,198 --> 01:57:11,699
And this position right here,

1379
01:57:13,786 --> 01:57:15,370
this is the Alamo.

1380
01:57:15,955 --> 01:57:19,624
They push us back this far,
last man alive blows the bridge.

1381
01:57:19,708 --> 01:57:21,751
We only got a 30-second delay
on that fuse,

1382
01:57:21,835 --> 01:57:23,878
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man

1383
01:57:23,963 --> 01:57:28,049
you better hurry your ass off,
or you're not going to be alive long.

1384
01:57:28,133 --> 01:57:31,552
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1385
01:57:32,471 --> 01:57:34,430
Never more than
two feet away from me,

1386
01:57:34,515 --> 01:57:36,724
and that's not negotiable.

1387
01:57:37,851 --> 01:57:40,311
I'll get some ammo. Come on.

1388
01:57:43,315 --> 01:57:44,607
- Hey, Upham.
- Yes.

1389
01:57:44,692 --> 01:57:46,567
- Listen to me, all right?
- Yeah.

1390
01:57:46,652 --> 01:57:48,194
- You're listening?
- Yes.

1391
01:57:48,320 --> 01:57:50,363
All right, we're gonna be displacing

1392
01:57:50,489 --> 01:57:52,073
and falling back like crazy
sons of bitches.

1393
01:57:52,157 --> 01:57:53,241
Right up there.

1394
01:57:53,325 --> 01:57:56,786
So you got to be Johnny on the spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1395
01:57:56,870 --> 01:57:58,579
- Right.
- You understand that?

1396
01:57:58,664 --> 01:58:00,957
- Johnny on the spot.
- Yeah.

1397
01:58:01,041 --> 01:58:04,168
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yes.

1398
01:58:04,503 --> 01:58:05,753
You know, when we were
shipping out of England

1399
01:58:05,838 --> 01:58:07,797
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1400
01:58:07,881 --> 01:58:11,009
and I said "No, thank you,
I don't smoke."

1401
01:58:12,011 --> 01:58:13,594
"I don't smoke."

1402
01:58:15,431 --> 01:58:18,391
- Quite a situation, huh?
- Unbelievable.

1403
01:58:19,727 --> 01:58:25,273
Here. Fucked up beyond
all recognition, right?

1404
01:58:25,733 --> 01:58:27,608
You got that right.

1405
01:58:29,862 --> 01:58:31,237
FUBAR.

1406
01:58:33,574 --> 01:58:34,615
Ouch.

1407
01:58:34,908 --> 01:58:36,534
- Yeah, well..
- FUBAR.

1408
01:58:36,618 --> 01:58:39,120
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1409
01:58:39,204 --> 01:58:41,122
Yeah. Okay.

1410
01:58:47,379 --> 01:58:49,047
Take it easy.

1411
01:58:50,215 --> 01:58:51,674
FUBAR.

1412
01:59:29,588 --> 01:59:33,925
- Who's that singing, sir?
- Edith Piaf.

1413
01:59:36,345 --> 01:59:38,888
What's she so upset about?

1414
01:59:39,723 --> 01:59:41,265
Her lover left her,

1415
01:59:41,392 --> 01:59:44,852
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1416
01:59:46,021 --> 01:59:47,939
That would do it.

1417
02:00:17,219 --> 02:00:20,179
"Even life itself only represents you."

1418
02:00:23,308 --> 02:00:25,893
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1419
02:00:25,978 --> 02:00:28,396
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1420
02:00:28,480 --> 02:00:30,857
- The chorus. It's the chorus.
- The chorus.

1421
02:00:31,608 --> 02:00:34,235
"And you speak softly in my ear"

1422
02:00:36,113 --> 02:00:38,531
"and you say things"

1423
02:00:38,615 --> 02:00:41,033
"that make my eyes close."

1424
02:00:43,370 --> 02:00:45,455
"And I find that marvellous."

1425
02:00:45,539 --> 02:00:48,166
- Again, Upham..
- Yes.

1426
02:00:48,876 --> 02:00:53,504
To be honest with you,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1427
02:00:54,381 --> 02:00:57,884
- Marvellous.
- No, it's really a melancholy song.

1428
02:00:58,010 --> 02:01:01,679
At the beginning of the song, she says,
"And then one day, you left."

1429
02:01:01,805 --> 02:01:05,808
"You left me, and I've been
desperate ever since."

1430
02:01:05,893 --> 02:01:09,061
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the Earth."

1431
02:01:09,188 --> 02:01:10,813
Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

1432
02:01:10,898 --> 02:01:12,607
the krauts aren't going
to have to shoot me.

1433
02:01:12,691 --> 02:01:15,526
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1434
02:01:15,652 --> 02:01:18,321
You know,
you're a strange bird, Upham.

1435
02:01:18,405 --> 02:01:20,281
Sorry, it's Edith, you know.

1436
02:01:20,365 --> 02:01:22,366
You know what
that song reminds me of?

1437
02:01:22,493 --> 02:01:25,161
It reminds me of Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
and what she said to me

1438
02:01:25,245 --> 02:01:26,746
the day I left for basic.

1439
02:01:26,872 --> 02:01:29,373
What, "Don't touch me"?

1440
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,043
No. Mrs Rachel Troubowitz
is our super's wife.

1441
02:01:32,169 --> 02:01:34,962
She comes into my mom's shop
to try on a few things, all right?

1442
02:01:35,047 --> 02:01:38,841
And she's easily, like, a 44 double E.

1443
02:01:38,926 --> 02:01:40,551
- Double E?
- These things are massive.

1444
02:01:40,677 --> 02:01:41,886
Those are big.

1445
02:01:42,012 --> 02:01:45,348
No. And I've got her convinced
that she's, like, a 42 D, all right?

1446
02:01:45,432 --> 02:01:47,141
So we're in the dressing room,
she's trying to squeeze

1447
02:01:47,226 --> 02:01:50,728
into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle

1448
02:01:50,854 --> 02:01:53,022
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1449
02:01:53,106 --> 02:01:55,691
And it's beautiful 'cause she's just
pouring out of this thing, you know?

1450
02:01:55,776 --> 02:01:57,527
- Is it really tight?
- No, no. It's beautiful.

1451
02:01:57,611 --> 02:01:59,070
And she sees me, and she can tell

1452
02:01:59,196 --> 02:02:01,781
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty, all right?

1453
02:02:01,907 --> 02:02:03,908
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

1454
02:02:04,034 --> 02:02:06,494
And she says, "When you're over there",

1455
02:02:06,578 --> 02:02:08,454
"if you see anything that upsets you,"

1456
02:02:08,580 --> 02:02:11,624
"or if you're ever scared,
I want you to close your eyes"

1457
02:02:11,750 --> 02:02:14,752
"and think of these. You understand?"

1458
02:02:16,255 --> 02:02:18,381
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1459
02:02:31,562 --> 02:02:33,604
Are you all right, sir?

1460
02:02:34,606 --> 02:02:37,400
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1461
02:02:42,281 --> 02:02:45,241
Is it true you were
a teacher back home?

1462
02:02:46,285 --> 02:02:47,743
Yes.

1463
02:02:47,828 --> 02:02:50,162
See, that's something I could never do,
you know.

1464
02:02:50,289 --> 02:02:54,750
Not after the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir.

1465
02:02:57,087 --> 02:02:59,505
I had 1,000 kids like you.

1466
02:03:05,762 --> 02:03:08,472
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1467
02:03:09,808 --> 02:03:12,476
I've been trying,
and I can't see their faces at all.

1468
02:03:12,603 --> 02:03:14,770
Has that ever happened to you?

1469
02:03:14,855 --> 02:03:17,273
You gotta think of a context.

1470
02:03:19,484 --> 02:03:21,569
What does that mean?

1471
02:03:21,653 --> 02:03:23,195
Well, you don't just think
about their faces.

1472
02:03:23,322 --> 02:03:27,950
You think about something specific,
something you've done together.

1473
02:03:31,663 --> 02:03:34,624
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

1474
02:03:34,708 --> 02:03:37,835
I think of my hammock in the backyard,

1475
02:03:38,670 --> 02:03:43,007
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1476
02:03:47,304 --> 02:03:50,598
This one night, two of my brothers came

1477
02:03:50,682 --> 02:03:53,684
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

1478
02:03:54,519 --> 02:03:57,563
and they said
they had a surprise for me.

1479
02:03:58,148 --> 02:04:01,275
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft,

1480
02:04:01,360 --> 02:04:04,362
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1481
02:04:05,489 --> 02:04:08,532
with Alice. Alice Jardine.

1482
02:04:11,536 --> 02:04:15,706
I mean, picture a girl who just took
a nosedive from the ugly tree

1483
02:04:15,832 --> 02:04:18,417
and hit every branch coming down.

1484
02:04:20,379 --> 02:04:23,005
And Dan's got her shirt off.

1485
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:25,883
So he's working on this bra
and he's trying to get it off

1486
02:04:26,009 --> 02:04:29,220
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out,

1487
02:04:30,055 --> 02:04:33,391
"Danny, you're a young man!
Don't do it!"

1488
02:04:36,061 --> 02:04:39,563
And so Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams, and she jumps up,

1489
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:41,315
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

1490
02:04:41,400 --> 02:04:42,608
but she's still got this shirt
over her head.

1491
02:04:42,734 --> 02:04:46,904
She goes running right into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1492
02:04:47,030 --> 02:04:51,200
So now Dan is just so mad at us,
he starts coming after us,

1493
02:04:51,284 --> 02:04:53,661
but at the same time,
Alice is over there unconscious.

1494
02:04:53,745 --> 02:04:55,246
He's got to wake her up.

1495
02:04:55,372 --> 02:04:58,624
So he grabs her by a leg
and he's dragging her.

1496
02:04:58,750 --> 02:05:01,919
At the same time, he picks up a shovel
and he's going after Sean.

1497
02:05:02,045 --> 02:05:04,171
And Sean said,
"What are you trying to hit me for?"

1498
02:05:04,256 --> 02:05:06,382
"I just did you a favour."

1499
02:05:08,218 --> 02:05:10,094
And so this makes Dan more angry.

1500
02:05:10,220 --> 02:05:13,139
He tries to swing this thing.
He loses the shovel.

1501
02:05:13,265 --> 02:05:15,933
It goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

1502
02:05:16,059 --> 02:05:18,644
The thing explodes,
the whole barn almost goes up

1503
02:05:18,770 --> 02:05:20,938
because of this thing.

1504
02:05:35,787 --> 02:05:37,663
That was it. That was the last..
That was..

1505
02:05:37,789 --> 02:05:39,331
Dan went off to basic next day.

1506
02:05:39,458 --> 02:05:43,043
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1507
02:05:43,128 --> 02:05:45,254
That was two years ago.

1508
02:05:47,132 --> 02:05:48,507
Oh, my.

1509
02:05:50,469 --> 02:05:54,013
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1510
02:05:55,265 --> 02:05:56,640
No.

1511
02:05:57,809 --> 02:06:00,519
No. That one I save just for me.

1512
02:07:05,836 --> 02:07:07,711
Enemy from the east.

1513
02:07:08,880 --> 02:07:11,799
He sees Tiger tanks, two of them.

1514
02:07:11,883 --> 02:07:13,884
Panzer tanks, two of them.

1515
02:07:14,010 --> 02:07:15,803
Infantry.

1516
02:07:15,887 --> 02:07:17,763
Fifty plus change.

1517
02:07:26,731 --> 02:07:28,482
Disperse! You know what to do!

1518
02:07:28,567 --> 02:07:30,109
- Reiben, get on the rabbit.
- Yes, sir.

1519
02:07:30,235 --> 02:07:33,571
- Upham, get some cover.
- Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1520
02:07:33,697 --> 02:07:36,615
- This is it.
- Everybody check your ammo!

1521
02:07:37,284 --> 02:07:38,576
Good luck, Reiben.

1522
02:07:38,702 --> 02:07:42,037
I don't need any luck, Sarge,
I was born lucky.

1523
02:07:54,801 --> 02:07:56,093
One in five tracer?

1524
02:07:56,177 --> 02:07:58,178
Yep, and tracers point both ways.

1525
02:07:58,263 --> 02:08:02,308
Yeah? Why don't you check
the head space and she should run.

1526
02:08:10,150 --> 02:08:12,359
Upham! Hustle up!

1527
02:09:02,702 --> 02:09:04,370
- Corporal Upham?
- Yes, sir.

1528
02:09:04,496 --> 02:09:06,747
We don't have a 30-calibre
machine gun in this position.

1529
02:09:06,831 --> 02:09:10,209
Either Mr Mellish or Mr Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

1530
02:09:10,335 --> 02:09:11,669
Yes, sir.

1531
02:09:12,504 --> 02:09:15,756
Upham! Jackson's fine.
Turn around to Mellish.

1532
02:09:37,195 --> 02:09:42,157
There's a ton of infantry, Captain.
I don't know if they took the bait though.

1533
02:10:04,931 --> 02:10:07,057
You got any more of that?

1534
02:10:53,229 --> 02:10:55,564
Panzers didn't take the bait.

1535
02:11:00,487 --> 02:11:03,322
Infantry's moving to the left.

1536
02:11:03,406 --> 02:11:06,784
Half track just went by
with about 20 troops, sir.

1537
02:12:45,466 --> 02:12:48,802
Mellish! Henderson! Displace!

1538
02:13:10,366 --> 02:13:12,159
Do it, now! Light it up!

1539
02:13:12,243 --> 02:13:14,036
You! Light it!

1540
02:13:25,215 --> 02:13:27,341
Thirty infantry on the right flank!

1541
02:13:27,425 --> 02:13:29,927
Get over there,
find a hole, and stop them!

1542
02:13:30,011 --> 02:13:31,678
Displace!

1543
02:13:43,274 --> 02:13:44,566
Upham!

1544
02:13:59,958 --> 02:14:01,416
Clear!

1545
02:14:03,211 --> 02:14:04,461
Krauts!

1546
02:14:06,464 --> 02:14:07,965
Right flank!

1547
02:14:44,419 --> 02:14:46,586
Get down! Get down!

1548
02:14:53,636 --> 02:14:56,763
Upham! Upham! 30-cal! Hurry!

1549
02:14:56,848 --> 02:15:00,350
And find the captain!
This flank's going to fold!

1550
02:15:55,239 --> 02:15:58,033
Reversing! He's still in this fight!

1551
02:15:59,035 --> 02:16:01,578
No, no, Ryan, get down! Get down!

1552
02:16:14,509 --> 02:16:36,363
Ryan!

1553
02:16:38,699 --> 02:16:40,283
- Ryan!
- Get off me!

1554
02:16:40,410 --> 02:16:42,869
- Are you all right?
- Get off me!

1555
02:16:42,954 --> 02:16:45,122
Yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, too, Captain. Thanks.

1556
02:16:45,957 --> 02:16:50,627
Okay, both sides!
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1557
02:16:53,589 --> 02:16:55,090
Grenade!

1558
02:16:56,926 --> 02:16:58,593
20-mill!

1559
02:17:00,054 --> 02:17:02,764
Flak gun, 20 millimetre. Take it out!

1560
02:17:15,111 --> 02:17:18,655
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
I ain't got a shot!

1561
02:17:23,161 --> 02:17:24,870
Pincer move, Parker!

1562
02:17:24,996 --> 02:17:27,456
- Targets 8 o'clock low!
- Shit!

1563
02:17:27,540 --> 02:17:29,791
God grant me strength.

1564
02:17:43,681 --> 02:17:45,223
Displace!

1565
02:17:45,349 --> 02:17:46,725
Come on!

1566
02:18:02,533 --> 02:18:05,285
Cover, Upham! Cover! Cover!

1567
02:18:22,053 --> 02:18:24,054
I'm out of 30-calibre.

1568
02:18:27,433 --> 02:18:30,310
Blessed be the Lord, my strength,
which teaches my hands to war

1569
02:18:30,394 --> 02:18:32,729
and my fingers to fight.

1570
02:18:41,239 --> 02:18:43,740
My goodness and my fortress,

1571
02:18:43,824 --> 02:18:46,493
my high tower and my deliverer,

1572
02:18:49,080 --> 02:18:52,290
my shield and he in whom I trust.

1573
02:18:55,336 --> 02:18:57,420
Come here, baby.

1574
02:19:20,027 --> 02:19:21,820
Parker, get down!

1575
02:19:43,509 --> 02:19:45,927
Captain, that 20-millimetre's killing us.

1576
02:19:46,012 --> 02:19:48,305
We gotta try to flank it somehow.

1577
02:19:48,431 --> 02:19:51,308
Well, let me get over for the top shot.

1578
02:20:15,791 --> 02:20:17,208
Upham!

1579
02:20:36,062 --> 02:20:40,523
Upham! Upham!
Upham, ammo, God damn it!

1580
02:21:23,734 --> 02:21:26,152
I'm jammed! I'm jammed!
You got any 30-cal?

1581
02:21:26,237 --> 02:21:27,904
- I'm out.
- Shit.

1582
02:21:39,750 --> 02:21:42,252
Upham! Upham!

1583
02:22:40,394 --> 02:22:41,853
Reiben!

1584
02:23:08,339 --> 02:23:12,509
I'm out! I need another bandoleer!
Anybody got a bandoleer?

1585
02:23:37,535 --> 02:23:39,702
God! God!

1586
02:23:43,999 --> 02:23:46,918
You stupid son of a bitch!

1587
02:24:30,588 --> 02:24:33,131
Let's stop. Let's stop. Let's stop.
Listen to me! Listen to me! Stop!

1588
02:24:33,215 --> 02:24:34,966
Stop! Don't..

1589
02:25:12,004 --> 02:25:16,841
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

1590
02:25:16,926 --> 02:25:18,718
Son of a bitch!

1591
02:25:20,179 --> 02:25:21,220
Bitch!

1592
02:26:40,259 --> 02:26:43,386
- I'm out.
- Those 60 rounds.

1593
02:26:44,763 --> 02:26:47,932
- We can use them without the tube.
- How?

1594
02:26:48,017 --> 02:26:50,977
Fuse-arming wire, set back, heave it!

1595
02:27:06,702 --> 02:27:08,369
Panzerschreck!

1596
02:27:42,446 --> 02:27:44,655
We're going to the Alamo.

1597
02:27:54,917 --> 02:27:56,751
Alamo! Alamo!

1598
02:28:16,313 --> 02:28:18,606
We'll take it! You fall back!

1599
02:28:18,690 --> 02:28:22,318
- You be right behind us!
- Soon as we're in business!

1600
02:28:26,281 --> 02:28:28,366
Displace. Reiben.

1601
02:28:30,869 --> 02:28:32,328
Reload.

1602
02:29:21,128 --> 02:29:22,670
All right, go.

1603
02:29:23,922 --> 02:29:25,006
We're blowing the bridge!

1604
02:29:25,090 --> 02:29:28,009
- Get off! Clear the bridge!
- Displace..

1605
02:29:50,866 --> 02:29:53,868
Sarge! Mike, are you all right?

1606
02:29:53,952 --> 02:29:56,495
- I just got the wind knocked out of me.
- Well, get out of here!

1607
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:59,957
Take cover!
We're going to blow this bridge!

1608
02:30:01,418 --> 02:30:03,169
Come on, come on!

1609
02:30:07,966 --> 02:30:10,801
Tiger coming!
Coming across the bridge!

1610
02:30:42,876 --> 02:30:46,170
Captain, get behind something!

1611
02:30:46,255 --> 02:30:48,923
Come on, Captain, move it!

1612
02:31:11,863 --> 02:31:13,072
Mike.

1613
02:31:18,287 --> 02:31:19,620
Mike!

1614
02:31:58,618 --> 02:31:59,910
Captain.

1615
02:32:02,706 --> 02:32:06,792
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

1616
02:33:59,865 --> 02:34:01,198
Upham.

1617
02:34:32,189 --> 02:34:34,398
Hang in there, Captain.

1618
02:35:18,527 --> 02:35:20,236
Medic!

1619
02:35:23,031 --> 02:35:25,574
Medic! We got a medic?

1620
02:35:32,374 --> 02:35:35,251
They're tank-busters, sir. P-51 s.

1621
02:35:36,211 --> 02:35:38,420
Angels on our shoulders.

1622
02:35:44,386 --> 02:35:46,095
What, sir?

1623
02:35:50,559 --> 02:35:51,934
James..

1624
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:55,229
Earn this.

1625
02:35:59,484 --> 02:36:00,943
Earn it.

1626
02:36:30,390 --> 02:36:32,558
"My dear Mrs Ryan,"

1627
02:36:33,810 --> 02:36:36,270
"it's with the most profound sense of joy"

1628
02:36:36,354 --> 02:36:41,525
"that I write to inform you
your son Private James Ryan"

1629
02:36:41,651 --> 02:36:43,736
"is well and, at this very moment,"

1630
02:36:43,820 --> 02:36:47,281
"on his way home
from European battlefields."

1631
02:36:47,365 --> 02:36:50,868
"Reports from the front indicate
James did his duty in combat"

1632
02:36:50,994 --> 02:36:54,496
"with great courage
and steadfast dedication,"

1633
02:36:55,081 --> 02:36:57,666
"even after he was informed
of the tragic loss"

1634
02:36:57,751 --> 02:37:01,337
"your family has suffered
in this great campaign"

1635
02:37:01,421 --> 02:37:04,840
"to rid the world
of tyranny and oppression."

1636
02:37:04,924 --> 02:37:08,177
"I take great pleasure in joining
the Secretary of War,"

1637
02:37:08,345 --> 02:37:10,429
"the men and women
of the United States Army"

1638
02:37:10,513 --> 02:37:12,890
"and the citizens of a grateful nation"

1639
02:37:13,016 --> 02:37:15,893
"in wishing you good health
and many years of happiness"

1640
02:37:16,019 --> 02:37:18,520
"with James at your side."

1641
02:37:19,689 --> 02:37:23,692
"Nothing, not even the safe
return of a beloved son,"

1642
02:37:23,777 --> 02:37:25,319
"can compensate you"

1643
02:37:25,403 --> 02:37:28,447
"or the thousands
of other American families"

1644
02:37:28,531 --> 02:37:31,909
"who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war."

1645
02:37:32,035 --> 02:37:35,496
"And I might share with you some words
which have sustained me"

1646
02:37:35,580 --> 02:37:39,708
"through long, dark nights of peril,
loss and heartache."

1647
02:37:39,793 --> 02:37:41,251
"And I quote,"

1648
02:37:42,587 --> 02:37:44,171
"'I pray that our heavenly father"

1649
02:37:44,255 --> 02:37:47,466
"'may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement"

1650
02:37:47,550 --> 02:37:49,510
"'and leave you only
the cherished memory"

1651
02:37:49,594 --> 02:37:51,595
"'of the loved and lost"

1652
02:37:51,721 --> 02:37:54,056
"'and the solemn pride
that must be yours"

1653
02:37:54,140 --> 02:37:58,894
"'to have laid so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom."

1654
02:37:59,646 --> 02:38:01,313
"'Abraham Lincoln.'"

1655
02:38:01,898 --> 02:38:04,316
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,"

1656
02:38:04,401 --> 02:38:07,736
"George C Marshall,
General, Chief of Staff."

1657
02:38:59,122 --> 02:39:01,457
My family is with me today.

1658
02:39:02,417 --> 02:39:05,252
They wanted to come with me.

1659
02:39:06,921 --> 02:39:08,046
To be honest with you,

1660
02:39:08,131 --> 02:39:11,425
I wasn't sure how I'd feel
coming back here.

1661
02:39:14,804 --> 02:39:18,223
Every day I think about
what you said to me

1662
02:39:18,308 --> 02:39:20,434
that day on the bridge.

1663
02:39:22,312 --> 02:39:25,773
And I've tried to live my life
the best I could.

1664
02:39:26,858 --> 02:39:29,276
I hope that was enough.

1665
02:39:30,028 --> 02:39:32,780
I hope that, at least in your eyes,

1666
02:39:34,616 --> 02:39:38,327
I've earned what all of you
have done for me.

1667
02:39:51,841 --> 02:39:53,175
James.

1668
02:39:55,470 --> 02:39:57,471
"Captain John H Miller."

1669
02:40:06,147 --> 02:40:10,025
- Tell me I've led a good life.
- What?

1670
02:40:11,319 --> 02:40:13,487
Tell me I'm a good man.

1671
02:40:20,703 --> 02:40:22,329
You are.

1672
02:41:53,400 --> 02:42:01,000
