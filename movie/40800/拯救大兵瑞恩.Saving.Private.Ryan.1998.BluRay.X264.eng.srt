1
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,380
Dad?

2
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,160
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds! May God be with you!

3
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,820
Port side and starboard side stick!Move fast and clear those mortar holes!

4
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:42,800
I want to see plenty of beach between men.

5
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,630
Five men is a juicy opportunity. One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,470
Keep the sand out of your weapons! Keep those actions clear!

7
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,980
I'll see you on the beach!

8
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,480
Clear the mortar hole! Right and left!

9
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,830
Over the side!

10
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,300
Port and starboard!

11
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,470
Thank yo...

12
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,950
What now, sir?

13
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,370
I said, 'What the hell do we do now, sir?"

14
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,550
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

15
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:40,180
Captain Miller! Sergeant Horvath!

16
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:43,840
Move your men off the beach! Now!

17
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,690
Okay, you guys, get on my ass! Follow me!

18
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:52,930
-Sir! What's the rallying point?  -Anywhere but here!

19
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,580
-What now, sir?  -The seawall, move up to the seawall!

20
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:12,960
-Sir, I'm staying!   -Clear the beach to make way.

21
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,750
This is all we've got between us and the Almighty.

22
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,860
Every inch of this beach has been pre-sighted.

23
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,840
You stay here, you're dead men!

24
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,050
Mama, Mama!

25
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,280
Stay down, stay down!

26
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:56,820
-What are you guys?   -104th Medical Battalion,sir.

27
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,160
-We're here to set up field operations.  -Get rid of that crap!

28
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,670
Grab yourselves some weapons and follow me.

29
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,180
-I'm hit!  -Briggs!

30
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,260
Medic!

31
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,860
-I'm hit low! God!  -Medic!

32
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,590
Navy Beach Battalion, sir!

33
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,500
I've got to clear these obstacles. Make holes for the tanks!

34
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,670
-All the armour is floundering at sea.  -Orders, sir!

35
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:36,240
Go somewhere else! I'm clearing this one.

36
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,670
Come on, Briggs!

37
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,410
Medic!

38
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:46,910
Medic!

39
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:23,520
Move, move!

40
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,720
Come on, move!

41
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,440
Move, move!

42
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:58,590
Shore party! No armour has made it ashore.

43
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:03,560
We've got no DD tanks on the beach.Dog One is not open!

44
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,720
Who's in command here?

45
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,730
You are, sir!

46
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:14,260
Sergeant Horvath? Do you recognize where we are?

47
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,670
Where we're supposed to be, but no one else is.

48
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:20,210
Nobody's where they're supposed to be!

49
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:22,610
Shore party!

50
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:26,150
First wave ineffective! We do not hold the beach.

51
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:29,410
Say again, we do not hold the beach!

52
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:34,750
We're mixed up! We've got people from Fox,Able and George companies.

53
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,450
Plus, we got some Navy demo guys and a beachmaster.

54
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:43,190
Shore party, Shore party!

55
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:51,870
CAT-F, CAT-F, CA...

56
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,300
-Reiben here.  -Seen anybody else?

57
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:00,010
-Jackson,but that's it.  -Mellish here!

58
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:03,310
Caparzo! We've got DeForest back there with Wade!

59
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:09,050
D.'s hurt so bad he's sprung a hundred leaks! Wade says he's used up!

60
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:14,250
-Move on to somebody you can help.  -Let go, he's a battalion surgeon!

61
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:20,630
-Get his attention!   -Wade!

62
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,670
Wade! Wade!

63
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:28,280
Wade, don't do it! It's too risky, too risky, Doc!

64
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,670
Get your ass back here!

65
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,680
Get him off the beach.

66
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,510
I've got it! We've stopped the bleeding!

67
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,120
Fuck!

68
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,950
Just give us a fucking chance, you son of a bitch!

69
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,590
Wade, come on! You son of a fucking cocksucker!

70
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,600
Wade, it's Mellish. Wade!

71
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:52,770
Let's move! We found Miller! Let's move!

72
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,460
Fuck it!

73
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,160
Get down, get down!

74
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,170
This is all? This is all that's made it?

75
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:09,610
We got scattered pretty bad. There's bound to be more of us.

76
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,310
It's not enough.

77
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,580
Dog One exit. It's the cut to the right, or was it left?

78
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:18,920
No. Vierville is to the left. This is Dog One.

79
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:24,590
They're killing us and we don't have a fucking chance! That ain't fair!

80
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,070
-Gather weapons and ammo!  -Gather weapons and ammo!

81
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,010
Reiben! Where's your BAR?

82
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:46,690
Bottom of the Channel. The bitch tried to drown me.

83
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,720
Find a replacement.

84
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,860
Bangalores! Bring out some bangalores!

85
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:58,870
Engineers coming! Grenades, give me grenades!

86
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,500
Bangalores up the line! Bangalores up the line!

87
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:10,370
Heads up! Bangers coming your way! Come on, come on!

88
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:13,810
-Jackson here, sir!  -Reiben back, sir.

89
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:16,350
Oh, my God!

90
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:19,950
Mortars incoming!

91
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,490
One more, give me one more!

92
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,490
Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm going to die!

93
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:34,000
Oh, my God! Jesus! Oh, my God!

94
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Come on, put it in. Keep it moving.

95
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,900
We've got it.

96
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:41,940
Jesus! Lucky bastard.

97
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,140
Move it! Keep it moving!

98
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,050
You're not going to die. You're fine. Just don't look at it. Don't look at it!

99
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,950
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

100
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,600
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole!

101
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,630
Fire in the hole!

102
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:06,530
Fire in the hole!

103
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,610
We're in business! Defilade! Other side of the hole!

104
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,690
Give him some morphine.

105
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,760
That's it, let's go.

106
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,770
Inspected, morphine.

107
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,360
Routine.

108
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,680
Priority.

109
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,680
He is gone

110
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,960
Son of a bitch! Get in there.

111
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:17,200
-Fuck,I can't move!   -Mellish,give me your bayonet.

112
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:19,470
Sarge.

113
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,690
Two MG-42s, two mortars. Add 20, left 30.

114
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:49,840
There's defilade, but it's a good firing position if we can land the armour.

115
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:53,010
We've got to get this draw open!

116
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:58,170
-Reiben, Mellish! Let's get in the war!  -Take cover and put fire on that crew.

117
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,580
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk! Get ready!

118
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,720
Covering fire!

119
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,520
Go, go, go!

120
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,070
It's a goddam firing squad.

121
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,080
It's the only way we can get everybody out of here.

122
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,550
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes! You're next!

123
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,150
Why not just hand out blindfolds, Captain?

124
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:41,590
All we can do here is die! Covering fire!

125
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:45,160
Go, go, go!

126
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:49,890
Come on, come on, come on! Go, God damm it!

127
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
-Jackson.  -Sir.

128
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,110
See that impact crater? should give you defilade from the machine gun position.

129
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,380
Get in there and give me some fire discipline. Wait for my command.

130
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,860
Go!

131
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,610
If your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset.

132
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:38,510
I thought you were my mother.

133
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,380
Be not Thou far from me, O Lord.

134
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:51,250
Oh, my God. I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee.

135
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:56,230
I detest my sins for having offended Thee, O Lord. Listen to me, Lord.

136
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:06,570
All my strength! Haste Thee to help me.

137
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:25,330
Dog One exit, right here!

138
00:22:25,530 --> 00:22:27,020
We're in business!

139
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:30,560
Move, move!

140
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,130
Reiben. Go, Sarge!

141
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,970
Reiben!

142
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,370
Come on, Doyle!

143
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,570
Sarge!

144
00:23:53,450 --> 00:23:56,440
Flame! Doyle, do it!

145
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:03,580
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

146
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,200
On the right!

147
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,050
I'll give you "comrade", you son of a bitch!

148
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:32,090
Look out! Turn around, turn around.

149
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,300
Flush them out!

150
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:03,350
Cease fire, cease fire! Cut it out, cut it out!

151
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,990
Cease fire!

152
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,720
Sugar Cane, Sugar Charlie Three. Say again, Dog One is open.

153
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:14,420
Send in the dozers. I'm waiting here to tie in my flanks.

154
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,030
What?

155
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:23,370
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand what you're saying!

156
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:32,870
What did he say, what did he say?

157
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,050
Look, I washed for supper!

158
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,710
Who's got a bazooka,Goddammit

159
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,930
Hey, Fish. Look at this, a Hitler Youth knife.

160
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,330
And now it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

161
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,590
Keep it moving!

162
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:12,170
That's quite a view.

163
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,440
Yes, it is.

164
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,650
Quite a view.

165
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:56,980
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd. No doubt by now you have received full information"-

166
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,480
"about the untimely death of your son."

167
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:01,350
"No words can ever relieve your grief."

168
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,150
"Our outfiit has felt his loss greatly..." "He was a fiine soldier"-

169
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,400
"and believed strongly in what we were doing..."

170
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,570
"We were involved in one of the most important operations of the war."

171
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:13,260
"Al was the one who held us all together."

172
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:15,060
"He was the first to volunteer."

173
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,300
"We passed a road where over 4,000 troops had passed."

174
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:23,500
"Your husband served in a unit whose duty is to place itself beyond..."

175
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,580
"...which we all cherish and hold dear..."

176
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:30,380
"The loss of Lee and others like him is a distinct blow to the regiment."

177
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,490
"We understand your desire to learn about"-

178
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,680
"the circumstances leading to his death."

179
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:31,880
Colonel, I've got something you should know about.

180
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,980
These two men died in Normandy.

181
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:41,280
-This one at Omaha Beach.  -"Sean Ryan."

182
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,490
-This man at Utah.  -"Peter Ryan."

183
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:53,460
This man was killed last week in New Guinea.

184
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,970
"Daniel Ryan."

185
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,580
The three men're brothers,sir.

186
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,840
I just learned that this afternoon their mother's going to get all three telegrams.

187
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:14,220
There's also a fourth brother who parachuted in with 101st Airborne -

188
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:17,720
the night before the invasion. He is somewhere in Normandy.

189
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:20,290
-Is he alive?   -We don't know.

190
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:26,130
Come with me.

191
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,640
Goddammit.

192
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:16,300
All four were in the same company in the 29th Division -

193
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:19,170
but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau.

194
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:22,550
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

195
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:28,090
No. He was dropped 15 miles inland near Neuville, behind German lines.

196
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:33,350
Mac, there is no way you can know where he was dropped.

197
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,500
First report from lke's people at SHAEF said the 101st is scattered.

198
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,830
There are misdrops all over Normandy.

199
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,300
Assuming Private Ryan even survived the jump, he could be anywhere.

200
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,600
In fact, he's probably K.I.A.

201
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:50,300
And frankly, if we go sending some sort of rescue mission, -

202
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:54,350
flat-hatting throughout German reinforcements along our advance, -

203
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:57,450
they're going to be K.I.A., too.

204
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,140
I have a letter here...

205
00:34:23,010 --> 00:34:29,040
...written a long time ago to a Mrs Bixby in Boston. So bear with me.

206
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,050
"Dear Madam."

207
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,380
"I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement" -

208
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:40,360
"of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts" -

209
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:44,120
'that you are the mother of five..."

210
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:50,590
"...sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle."

211
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:57,670
"I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine" -

212
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,370
'that would attempt to beguile you from the grief' -

213
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:04,850
"of a loss so overwhelming..."

214
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:10,740
"...but I can't refrain from tendering the consolation that may be found" -

215
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:15,620
"in the thanks of the republic they died to save."

216
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:23,860
"May our Heavenly Father assuage the anguish of your bereavement" -

217
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,260
"and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost" -

218
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,180
"and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid such a sacrifice" -

219
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:39,000
"upon the altar of freedom. Yours very sincerely and respectfully," -

220
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,420
"Abraham Lincoln."

221
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:06,430
That boy is alive. We are going to send somebody to find him.

222
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,630
And we are going to get him the hell out of there.

223
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:27,350
The Quartermaster's up the beach a way. Look for a blown-up bunker.

224
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,800
-Miller,Charlie Company.  -Go on in,Captain.

225
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:34,000
If we don't off-load the Shermans by 0600 -

226
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:39,070
we'll have a division stuck at Carentan with its pants around its ankles.

227
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:41,550
Well, you let me know of it.

228
00:36:41,750 --> 00:36:45,010
Let Charlie Company hold at Vierville 'til we can get the armour there.

229
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,840
Runner!

230
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,550
Airborne was supposed to win an open door for us, but misdropped, -

231
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,600
and scattered all their sticks into the wind. What's your situation?

232
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,850
Yes, sir... Sector Four is secure.

233
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:10,000
We took out towed 88s here, here and here.

234
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:12,970
They got four Shermans and some deuce-and-a-halves.

235
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:16,110
These two minefields are actually one big one.

236
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,190
We went up the middle of it, but it turned into a mixed high-density field.

237
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:23,470
A little bit of everything; Sprengmine 44s, Schumne 42s, -

238
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,020
pot mines, A-200s, the little wooden bastard the detectors don't pick up.

239
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:34,750
Here, they placed big mushrooms, Teller mine 43s, I guess for our tanks, -

240
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,240
from here right up to the edge of the village, right here.

241
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,470
We marked them and called the engineers.

242
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,160
-Resistance?  -We had higher support expectations.

243
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:48,710
There was a company without artillery. Wehrmacht. 346th Infantry.

244
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,040
Von Lucke Kampfgruppe. We ended up with 23 prisoners.

245
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,710
We turned them over to MPs from the 29th.

246
00:37:58,030 --> 00:38:00,750
What about our casualties?

247
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:07,980
Well, the figure is... We're 35 dead, times two wounded.

248
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,150
They just didn't want to give up those 88s.

249
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,960
It was a tough assignment. That was why you got it.

250
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,540
Yes, sir.

251
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,670
John...

252
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,890
-I've got another one for you.   -Yes, sir.

253
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:28,250
It's straight from the top.

254
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,860
I wish. You and I are taking a squad to Neuville on a PR mission.

255
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,120
Oh, are you leading a squad?

256
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:45,590
A private in the 101st lost three brothers and he's got a ticket home.

257
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,960
-Why Neuville?  -They think he's there.

258
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:51,070
Part of all those Airborne misdrops.

259
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:55,370
It won't be easy finding one soldier in the middle of this goddam war.

260
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,600
Like finding a needle in a stack of needles.

261
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,300
What about the company?

262
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,640
We take the pick of the litter, the rest goes to Baker.

263
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:06,910
Jesus Christ! They took away your company?

264
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,220
It wasn't mine, it was the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

265
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:15,220
Get me Reiben on BAR, Jackson, Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

266
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:18,450
-Beasley's dead.  -Alright,Mellish then.

267
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,500
-Do have a guy who speaks French?    -Not that I know of.

268
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,930
What about Talbot? This morning.

269
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,200
I'm going to try and dig up another interpreter.

270
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:32,430
Assemble at the battalion motor pool on the beach.

271
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,080
What are we going to do? Listen up. What?

272
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,050
Go home wrapped in the American flag with a hunk of cheese in your ass.

273
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,450
I thought you liked it in the ass. What?

274
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,050
Attention!

275
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,850
As you were. I'm looking for Corporal Timothy Upham.

276
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,050
Yes, I'm Upham.

277
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,420
-Do you speak French and German?    -Yes, sir.

278
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,620
-How's your accent?   -Slight one in French.

279
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,930
-My German's clean.    -Very good.

280
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,830
You've been re-assigned to me. Grab your gear, we're going to Neuville.

281
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,480
-When was this updated?    -As of 8:30 this morning.

282
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,870
This is the 12th SS Panzer. These are the two axes advancing south.

283
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:13,070
There are Germans in Neuville. I understand, Corporal.

284
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,950
There are a lot of Germans in Neuville. You've got a problem with that?

285
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:20,650
Please consider that I've never been in combat. I make maps and translate.

286
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:24,060
I need someone who speaks French and German.

287
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,360
My two guys were killed. I haven't held a weapon since training.

288
00:40:28,570 --> 00:40:31,000
Did you fire the weapon in Basic training?

289
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,640
-Yes, sir.   -Well, then get your gear.

290
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,210
Sir, may I bring...

291
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,640
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

292
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,850
Yes, sir.

293
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,320
Thank you very much.

294
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:58,620
-Is that a souvenir?    -No, sir.

295
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,590
Take your time.

296
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,930
You should look on the bright side of things, Corporal.

297
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:12,300
-Yes. -For one thing, you don't need those.

298
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:16,570
-You'll need that.   -Yes. I'll need this, not that.

299
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,000
Hey! Hey!

300
00:42:15,210 --> 00:42:17,440
You want your head blown off?

301
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:22,510
Don't touch me with those rat claws again. Get the fuck back in formation!

302
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:26,520
I was just wondering where you're from.

303
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,120
-Caparzo,is it?  -Drop dead,Corporal.

304
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,520
Gotcha.

305
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:40,360
Every time you salute the Captain,you make him a target for the Germans.

306
00:42:40,570 --> 00:42:42,470
-I'm sorry.  -Do us a favour.Don't do it.

307
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:45,300
Especially when I'm standing next to him.Capisci?

308
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,600
-Capisco.  -Corporal,what's your book about?

309
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,100
Watch your rifle. Sorry.

310
00:42:50,310 --> 00:42:55,250
It's about the brotherhood that develops between soldiers during war.

311
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:59,080
Brotherhood? What do you know about brotherhood?

312
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,310
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

313
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,080
Why don't you ask the Captain where he's from?

314
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,690
Ask the Captain. He'll tell you everything you want to know about him.

315
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,130
Explain the maths of this to me.

316
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:15,270
Where is the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?

317
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:18,400
20 degrees. Anybody wants to answer that?

318
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,700
Reiben, think about the poor bastard's mother.

319
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:24,030
Hey, Doc, I've got a mother.

320
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,570
You've got a mother, Sarge has got a mother.

321
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:30,270
Shit, I bet even the Captain's got a mother.

322
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:33,250
Maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us.

323
00:43:33,450 --> 00:43:35,750
"Their's is not to reason why their's is but to do and die"

324
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:40,250
What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Corporal?

325
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,790
We're all supposed to die?

326
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:45,660
-Upham's talking about our duty.  -Yes, sir.

327
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:46,890
We all have orders to follow.

328
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,200
Yes, sir. Thank you. Even if the mission is "FUBAR"?

329
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,900
Especially if the mission is "FUBAR".

330
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:01,310
-What's "FUBAR"?  -It's German.

331
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:03,640
Never heard of that...

332
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:07,980
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

333
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:10,880
By all means, share it with the squad.

334
00:44:11,090 --> 00:44:13,320
From my way of thinking, -

335
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:18,290
this mission is a misallocation of valuable military resources.

336
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,330
Yeah? Go on.

337
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:26,130
It seems to me that God gave me a sepcial gift made me a fine instrument of warfare.

338
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,170
Reiben,pay attention.Now, this is the way to gripe.Continue,Jackson.

339
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,810
If He was to put me and this sniper rifle anywhere up to and including -

340
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:39,210
one mile of Adolf Hitler with a clear line of sight, sir...

341
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:42,650
Pack your bags, fellas, the war is over. Amen.

342
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,080
That's brilliant, bumpkin.

343
00:44:45,290 --> 00:44:48,120
What about you, Captain? You don't gripe at all?

344
00:44:48,330 --> 00:44:51,590
I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.

345
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,590
Gripe always go up.

346
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,600
You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers, and so on.

347
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,670
I don't gripe in front of you. You should know that as a Ranger.

348
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:07,540
I'm sorry, but let's say that you weren't a captain or that I was a major.

349
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:09,480
What would you say?

350
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,580
In that case, I'd say, "This is an excellent mission" -

351
00:45:13,790 --> 00:45:18,220
"with a valuable objective worthy of my best efforts."

352
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:23,990
"Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private Ryan" -

353
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:29,460
"and I'll lay down my life and those of my men, especially yours, Reiben," -

354
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,160
'to ease her suffering."

355
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,900
He's good. I love him.

356
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,150
Fine!

357
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:31,520
-Thunder!  -Flash!

358
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:35,530
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

359
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,310
Go, go, go, go!

360
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:54,820
You are a sight for sore eyes. Sergeant Hill, our reliefs showed up.

361
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:59,120
-How many are you?   -Eight. We're not your relief.

362
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:02,590
What do you mean, sir? We're here for a Private Ryan.

363
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,230
Who? Ryan? What for?

364
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:08,730
-Is he here?  -Maybe on the other side of the town.

365
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:11,430
It's hard to get to. The Germans punched a hole in our centre.

366
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,570
-They cut us right in two.  -What's his name,again?

367
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:17,870
Ryan, James Ryan. He dropped in with the 101st.

368
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:21,100
Goldman, get me a runner! Runner!

369
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:23,210
Come on!

370
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,320
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

371
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:33,920
We got stopped by fire from the eastward.

372
00:47:34,130 --> 00:47:37,750
The Germans have been reinforcing two regiments all day.

373
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:40,020
It's been quiet for 45 minutes.

374
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:42,670
The Germans concentrate their fire westward.

375
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:46,170
Who's that on the loudspeaker? Dagwood Duesseldorf.

376
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:50,870
Our friendly neighbourhood morale officer.

377
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:54,340
"The Statue of Liberty is kaput."

378
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:56,910
That's disconcerting.

379
00:48:01,390 --> 00:48:05,620
Your father was circumcised by my rabbi, you prick!

380
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,480
Cover!

381
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,100
Go!

382
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:44,960
You sadistic fucking animals! Get down.

383
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:48,030
They know we're not in direct contact. They'll single out the runners.

384
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:49,790
Why do they shoot them up?

385
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:53,560
As long as his lungs are working, he carries the message. We'd do the same.

386
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:57,300
No, we wouldn't! Wade! Get them ready to travel.

387
00:48:57,510 --> 00:48:59,340
Boyd! Come on!

388
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:02,210
Try again! Let Captain Hamill know we're coming.

389
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:04,680
What's the rest of Neuville like?

390
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:08,680
The next block's got two-storey buildings. A lot of windows.

391
00:49:08,890 --> 00:49:10,950
There's a square with good cover.

392
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,560
Show me. Sarge, hold right here!

393
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:15,190
Yes, sir!

394
00:49:19,430 --> 00:49:21,990
Stay out of this enfilade and use the buildings.

395
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,140
Try a left hook. Shoot and scoot. Two of yours, two of mine.

396
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:27,830
Hastings, Goldman! Up front!

397
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,640
Reiben, Caparzo. They're still jamming us.

398
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,900
Short runs, high and low at the corners. It's going to be tight.

399
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:37,480
Be prepared for close contact. Go.

400
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,150
Upham! You stay with Sergeant Horvath.

401
00:49:40,350 --> 00:49:44,380
Stay here! I'll wear him like underwear, Captain. You stay with me.

402
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,470
Past the end of the block are the gates of the square.

403
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:57,640
Good. Alright.

404
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,740
Reiben, where's the Captain from?

405
00:50:06,950 --> 00:50:10,680
If you figure it out, you'll get a prize. 300 bucks, last I heard.

406
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:14,370
The company's got a pool. Five bucks gets you in.

407
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:24,950
It's around this corner. Defilade right up to those gates.

408
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,800
Somebody must know where he's from.

409
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:31,970
I've been with him since Casserene Pass. I don't have a clue.

410
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:37,010
My ankles are killing me. I'll need a wheelchair before the war is over.

411
00:50:37,210 --> 00:50:41,470
That's it! Oh, my God! That ankle is like an old woman.

412
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:45,050
Like an old... Oh, God!

413
00:50:46,350 --> 00:50:49,580
Reiben. So you don't even know where he went to school?

414
00:50:49,790 --> 00:50:54,020
He didn't go to school. They assembled him at OCS out of dead Gls.

415
00:50:54,230 --> 00:50:57,560
Pay attention to detail. I know where he's from and what he did -

416
00:50:57,760 --> 00:50:59,860
because I pay attention to detail.

417
00:51:00,070 --> 00:51:03,330
Hey, Upham! Careful you don't step in the bullshit.

418
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:11,140
Do it. Thunder!

419
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,870
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

420
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,070
Mellish, Caparzo, come here!

421
00:51:23,890 --> 00:51:26,720
Tell them to show themselves.

422
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:41,300
Ask them where the Germans are.

423
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:48,010
What is he saying? Something about the children.

424
00:51:48,210 --> 00:51:50,370
Kids? He wants us to take them.

425
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,310
No, no. We can't take the kids.

426
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:58,010
We can't take the kids! No, no!

427
00:52:00,230 --> 00:52:03,190
They think they'll be safe. They won't be safe with us!

428
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,160
Are you nuts? Listen to the Captain!

429
00:52:07,770 --> 00:52:09,670
They think they'll be safe with us.

430
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:15,310
It's not safe anywhere. Caparzo! Put that kid back!

431
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:20,010
Caparzo, put the girl back! It's OK, it's OK.

432
00:52:20,210 --> 00:52:22,370
Give that kid back!

433
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:27,280
Upham, how do you say, "It's OK?" I can't. She reminds me of my niece.

434
00:52:27,490 --> 00:52:29,420
Get the kid back up there!

435
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,020
We should at least take her to the next town.

436
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:36,320
We're not here to do that, we're here to follow orders!

437
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:39,660
Sarge, take this goddam kid!

438
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,530
Cover, cover!

439
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:51,240
No!

440
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,340
Goddammit! Where did that come from?

441
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,110
He was on the ground before we heard the shot.

442
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,360
That's where I'd be.

443
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,090
I didn't see it. 450 yards, maybe a shade under.

444
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:16,060
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas. This sniper's got talent!

445
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:25,610
Please don't cry. I'll take you back to Mama and Papa. Please don't cry.

446
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:27,110
Come on.

447
00:53:29,810 --> 00:53:31,010
Carpy!

448
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:45,400
Captain! Hold on, Caparzo.

449
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,330
Help me up. I can walk.

450
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,160
Caparzo, stay still!

451
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:04,910
Two clicks. Left wind.

452
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,950
Fish!

453
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,860
Captain, can you see him? How is he?

454
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:22,160
Wade, you stay put.

455
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,530
Where is he shot, Captain?

456
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:28,600
Can you see him? You stay there!

457
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,170
Damn it! Stay down!

458
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:36,010
What's the matter with you? Am I going to take care of you if you get hit?

459
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:38,050
Fish, come over here!

460
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:41,840
Carpy, put your head down! Why can't you put your head down?

461
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,560
Oh, my God, I trust in Thee.

462
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:59,570
Let me not be ashamed. Let not my enemies triumph over me.

463
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:13,050
Copy it. Copy it and send it for me.

464
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:15,810
You're going to send it yourself. Put it down!

465
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,990
-It's got blood on it!   -I see it.

466
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:27,490
It's... It's to my dad. It's got blood on it, Fish.

467
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,260
We got him. Stay down.

468
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:10,540
How bad is it? Chest, maybe lung shot.

469
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:29,220
Get that.30 up the street!

470
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,560
Detail! Clear, up!

471
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:38,330
Clear, down!

472
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,810
That's why we can't take children.

473
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,630
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

474
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,320
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

475
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,830
-Sergeant Hill.   -Yes, sir.

476
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:16,230
Gather your men. We'll form up at the northwest corner of the square.

477
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:18,000
-Jackson.   -Sir!

478
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:23,340
Mellish. Check the tower, hustle back here. Right now, go!

479
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:36,590
Fuck Ryan!

480
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:51,140
Thunder! Flash! Come on in!

481
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:58,010
Hey, guys. We're looking for Captain Hamill.

482
00:57:58,220 --> 00:58:01,010
Down there, across the square. Across the square.

483
00:58:01,220 --> 00:58:03,380
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

484
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:06,590
Sit down.

485
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:25,400
Jimmy T. Go and find Captain Hamill. Bring him here.

486
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:29,570
-What? Up there?   -How should I know? Go and look!

487
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:31,540
Thank you, you moron.

488
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:38,310
Alright. You guys just flake out here for a while.

489
00:58:39,990 --> 00:58:43,590
Let me get this goddam hitchhiker out of my boot.

490
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,570
Put your weapons down! Drop them now!

491
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:03,440
I'll shoot you!

492
00:59:03,650 --> 00:59:05,050
Drop, drop 'em!

493
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,950
Put 'em down!

494
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:27,160
Clear, up!

495
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,740
Shit, shit!

496
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,240
Clear, up!

497
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,380
Clear, down!

498
00:59:51,330 --> 00:59:52,760
Enough to make you old.

499
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,330
Let's hope so.

500
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:09,280
Hamill, Pathfinders 101st. Miller, 2nd Rangers.

501
01:00:09,470 --> 01:00:12,010
Thank you.

502
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:14,680
We're looking for a Private Ryan. He's part of your outfit.

503
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,910
Any chance that you policed him up?

504
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,460
How was the road in? Scenic. We lost most of our ammo.

505
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:24,630
Not to mention one of our men.

506
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:29,100
Lieutenant! Redeploy that bazooka to the right side of the road.

507
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,530
And get Ryan up here!

508
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:38,260
Ryan! Ryan! Front and centre! Ryan!

509
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:44,210
Here comes our boy.

510
01:00:51,460 --> 01:00:53,480
I told you he was an asshole.

511
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:58,220
Private Ryan reporting as ordered. At ease.

512
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,200
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers, wants a word with you.

513
01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:05,630
This way.

514
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:09,070
Alright. Take a knee.

515
01:01:18,110 --> 01:01:20,450
Private, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

516
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:33,320
Well, there isn't any really easy way to say this, so...

517
01:01:35,220 --> 01:01:38,600
...so I'll just say it. Your brothers are dead.

518
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,520
We have orders to come and get you...

519
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:46,760
...because you're going home.

520
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:02,980
Oh, my God! My brothers are dead!

521
01:02:10,970 --> 01:02:14,770
I was going to take them fishing when we got home.

522
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:32,540
I'm so sorry, James. I can't tell you how much.

523
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:38,160
-How did they die?   -They were killed in action.

524
01:02:40,230 --> 01:02:42,350
That can't be.

525
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:47,630
They can't be my brothers. They're still in grammar school.

526
01:02:50,670 --> 01:02:54,030
-You're James Ryan?   -Yeah.

527
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,340
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

528
01:02:57,550 --> 01:03:00,940
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

529
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:11,440
-Does that mean my brothers are OK?   -Yeah,I'm sure they're fine.

530
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,590
Are you sure? We're looking for a different Ryan.

531
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:16,230
It's just a big foul-up.

532
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:20,860
How can you be sure? How do you know that the foul-up isn't -

533
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,050
that his brothers are OK, and...

534
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,320
Lieutenant. I'm sorry for the trouble.

535
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:30,700
I just wrote them a letter before I left. I've got to get home.

536
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:35,720
I've got to get home right now. I want to go home.

537
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:37,750
Where is our Ryan? Don't know.

538
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:41,970
Are you in touch with your CO? What unit's Ryan in?

539
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:46,150
Baker Company, 506th. The guy with the broken foot's in 506th.

540
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,820
-Charlie, I think.   -You think?

541
01:03:49,020 --> 01:03:52,790
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

542
01:03:52,990 --> 01:03:55,470
-Where was your dropzone?    -Vierville.

543
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:58,390
Vierville? How did you end up here?

544
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,690
You got me, sir. The C-47 took heavy fire.

545
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:04,390
Pilot went crazy turning every which way.

546
01:04:04,610 --> 01:04:08,740
We took more fire in the drop. It got messy. I ended up here.

547
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,040
I haven't seen a single guy from my stick. God knows where they are.

548
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:15,880
Did anybody from Baker Company talk about where the dropzone was?

549
01:04:16,080 --> 01:04:19,380
No, but they had the same rallying point as us.

550
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:21,490
Show me.

551
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:27,850
My men are beat. We'll hold up here for three hours and pull out after dark.

552
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:30,760
Got anything left in this town, like a three-star hotel?

553
01:04:30,970 --> 01:04:34,070
Something with clean sheets, soft pillows and room service?

554
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,670
-How about a nice, comfy church? -We'll take that.

555
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:40,700
What have you heard? How is it all falling together?

556
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,070
We got the beachhead secured,but Monty's taking his time moving on Caen.

557
01:04:45,280 --> 01:04:49,310
-We can't pull out'til he's ready,so...  -That guy's overrated.

558
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,010
-No argument here.  -You take Caen to take Saint-L8.

559
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:56,820
-You gotta take St-L8 to take Valognes. -Valognes,you've got Cherbourg.

560
01:04:57,020 --> 01:05:00,460
-Cherbourg,you've got Paris.  -Paris,you've got Berlin.

561
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:03,140
And then that big boat home.

562
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:10,100
I could really use you around here, but I understand what you're doing.

563
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:14,430
-You do?  -I've got a couple of brothers myself.

564
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:16,770
Oh. Good luck.

565
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:19,470
-Thank you.   -No, I mean it.

566
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:22,740
Find him. Get him home.

567
01:05:30,590 --> 01:05:32,680
What's with your hand?

568
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,260
I don't know.

569
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:40,440
It started in Portsmouth when we went down for embarkation.

570
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:45,260
-It comes and goes.  -You have to find yourself a new job.

571
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,100
This one doesn't seem to agree with you any more.

572
01:05:54,050 --> 01:05:55,710
What?

573
01:06:00,020 --> 01:06:01,950
-What?   -Nothing.

574
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:04,890
What was the name of that kid at Anzio?

575
01:06:05,090 --> 01:06:08,080
The one who walked on his hands -

576
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:11,060
and was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze?

577
01:06:11,270 --> 01:06:14,060
Vecchio. Vecchio!

578
01:06:19,750 --> 01:06:23,440
Yeah, Vecchio. He was a goofy kid.

579
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:29,910
I remember he used to pee a "v" on everybody's jackets. For "vecchio".

580
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,050
For victory. Vecchio.

581
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:39,450
He was so short. He was a midget, wasn't he?

582
01:06:39,660 --> 01:06:43,460
Yeah, how did he get to be a Ranger?

583
01:06:43,660 --> 01:06:46,260
He got shot in the foot once, walking on his hands.

584
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:50,270
He could walk faster on his hands.

585
01:06:50,470 --> 01:06:53,340
He could run faster on his hands.

586
01:06:56,110 --> 01:06:59,770
Vecchio. Yeah.

587
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,750
Caparzo.

588
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:15,190
You see, when you end up killing one of your men, -

589
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:20,100
you tell yourself it happened so you could save the lives of -

590
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,530
two, three, or ten others.

591
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:28,210
Maybe 100 others.

592
01:07:31,910 --> 01:07:34,810
Do you know how many men I've lost under my command?

593
01:07:35,020 --> 01:07:37,280
-How many?  -94.

594
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:44,360
But that means I've saved the lives of ten times that many, doesn't it?

595
01:07:45,430 --> 01:07:49,420
Maybe even 20, right? 20 times as many?

596
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:58,030
And that's how simple it is.

597
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,400
That's how you rationalise making the choice -

598
01:08:03,610 --> 01:08:06,670
between the mission and the men.

599
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:09,750
Except that this time the mission is a man.

600
01:08:13,490 --> 01:08:16,050
This Ryan had better be worth it.

601
01:08:18,790 --> 01:08:21,490
He'd better go home and cure some disease -

602
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:25,860
or invent a longer-lasting light-bulb or something.

603
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:30,500
For the truth is that I wouldn't trade ten Ryans for one Vecchio or Caparzo.

604
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,500
Amen.

605
01:08:34,580 --> 01:08:38,100
Look, there it goes again. Sir.

606
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,170
Are you alright?

607
01:08:45,690 --> 01:08:50,420
We'll move out in two hours. Why don't you get some sleep?

608
01:08:51,430 --> 01:08:54,420
-I don't know how he does it.  -What's that?

609
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,150
Falls asleep like that. Look at him.

610
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,330
The guy's lights-out the minute his head hits the pack.

611
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:03,870
-Clear conscience.  -What's that saying?

612
01:09:04,070 --> 01:09:06,370
God's on our side, who could be on theirs?

613
01:09:06,570 --> 01:09:09,540
"If God be for us, who could be against us?"

614
01:09:09,740 --> 01:09:11,840
Yeah, what did I say?

615
01:09:12,050 --> 01:09:16,210
The trick to falling asleep is trying to stay awake.

616
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:18,080
How is that, Wade?

617
01:09:18,290 --> 01:09:23,190
When my mother was an intern she used to work through the night -

618
01:09:23,420 --> 01:09:24,820
and sleep through the day.

619
01:09:25,830 --> 01:09:29,160
The only time we talked was when she'd get home.

620
01:09:29,360 --> 01:09:36,290
I used to lie in bed and stay awake as long as I could,but it never worked

621
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:40,800
because the harder I tried the faster I'd fall asleep.

622
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:44,240
That wouldn't have mattered in my house.Ma would've come home,

623
01:09:44,440 --> 01:09:49,580
shook me awake,chatted me up 'til dawn.She was never too tired to talk.

624
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:53,050
That's probably the only time she could get a word in.

625
01:09:57,820 --> 01:10:01,420
Funny thing is,sometimes she would come home early

626
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:03,990
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

627
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:08,030
-Who, your mum?  -Yeah.

628
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,970
She'd stand in the doorway looking at me,

629
01:10:14,170 --> 01:10:17,040
and I would just keep my eyes shut.

630
01:10:19,180 --> 01:10:23,080
And I knew that she just wanted to find out about my day,

631
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:29,780
that she came home early just to talk to me.

632
01:10:32,630 --> 01:10:36,690
And I still wouldn't move. I'd still pretend to be asleep.

633
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,140
I don't know why I did that.

634
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:03,090
We've only got a couple of hours. Shut up and go to sleep.

635
01:11:12,070 --> 01:11:15,330
Captain? Sir?

636
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,560
Corporal.

637
01:11:23,180 --> 01:11:26,510
How are you doing? Are you alright?

638
01:11:26,710 --> 01:11:29,840
Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir.

639
01:11:31,350 --> 01:11:34,880
Really? How is that?

640
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,330
'War educates the senses, calls into action the will," -

641
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:46,690
"perfects the physical constitution," -

642
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:50,630
"brings men in such swift and close collision in critical moments," -

643
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:53,170
'that man measures man."

644
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:58,140
I guess that's Emerson's way of finding the bright side.

645
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:02,650
-You know Emerson, sir?   -I know some.

646
01:12:06,450 --> 01:12:10,790
So, where are you from, Captain? What did you do before the war?

647
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:14,580
What's the pool up to?

648
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:21,770
I think it's around 300, sir.

649
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:26,600
When it gets up to 500,I'll give you the answer and we'll split the money.

650
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:28,800
How about that?

651
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:32,410
If that's the way you feel, I feel it's my duty under your command

652
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:37,520
to suggest that we wait until it gets up to 1,000. I think it's...

653
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,280
What if we don't live that long?

654
01:12:44,220 --> 01:12:47,280
-500?  -500 would be good, yes.

655
01:12:47,490 --> 01:12:49,430
Yes, sir.

656
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:55,190
-Get some sleep, Corporal.  -Yes, sir.

657
01:14:01,270 --> 01:14:03,460
Who's got sulfa powder?

658
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:10,300
Medic, my buddy's bleeding! He needs a tourniquet.

659
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,530
-Wade.   -Yes, sir?

660
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,980
-See what you can do.   -Yes, sir.

661
01:14:14,180 --> 01:14:17,280
Hold on, fellas. It won't be much longer.

662
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:19,850
How are we doing here?

663
01:14:20,050 --> 01:14:25,890
Alright. You're doing alright, don't worry about it. The Doc's in town.

664
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:31,290
Don't worry. The 29th Infantry's breaking through. They'll be here soon.

665
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:33,800
Has anybody got plasma?

666
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,930
Hey, Captain!

667
01:14:36,140 --> 01:14:39,630
-Soldier,you want to fill me in?  -Yeah.Lieutenant DeWindt.

668
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:43,610
99th Troop Carrier Squadron carrying in 300th and 307th Glider Infantry.

669
01:14:43,810 --> 01:14:46,540
This one was mine. I was the pilot. Private!

670
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,010
22 men dead. Take care of this one.

671
01:14:48,220 --> 01:14:50,980
I landed there without a scratch, took my co-pilot's head right off.

672
01:14:51,180 --> 01:14:52,910
Who are these people?

673
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:57,320
The guys we came in with headed off the first night. Haven't seen them since.

674
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:01,430
In the meantime other guys keep showing up. One, two, six at a time.

675
01:15:01,630 --> 01:15:04,430
Then some officer will come along, patch together a mixed unit, -

676
01:15:04,630 --> 01:15:06,960
and head off to make trouble.

677
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:11,370
We're looking for a Private Ryan, Baker Company, 506th of the 101st.

678
01:15:11,570 --> 01:15:13,730
You got me. A lot of guys come in and out.

679
01:15:13,940 --> 01:15:17,170
Upham! Check out that squad. See if Ryan's in it.

680
01:15:17,380 --> 01:15:19,110
Yes, sir.

681
01:15:20,510 --> 01:15:25,650
Reiben! Smell that leg, right there. Find out if it's south of cheese.

682
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:34,180
What?

683
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:36,790
Hands over your head.

684
01:15:38,670 --> 01:15:40,530
Keep moving!

685
01:15:43,370 --> 01:15:45,130
I'm Jude, you know.

686
01:15:47,810 --> 01:15:51,570
I couldn't pry him out of there. I need a winch.

687
01:15:51,780 --> 01:15:53,370
Yeah.

688
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,850
-Stars.  -Yeah.

689
01:15:59,050 --> 01:16:03,460
Brigadier General Amend. Deputy Commander, 101st.

690
01:16:03,690 --> 01:16:08,420
Some genius had the great idea of welding steel plates onto our deck

691
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,990
to keep the General safe from ground fire,

692
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:15,330
but they forgot to tell me until just before we were getting airborne.

693
01:16:15,540 --> 01:16:19,060
That's like trying to fly a freight train. OK?

694
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:22,900
Gross overload. Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

695
01:16:23,110 --> 01:16:25,980
I nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.

696
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:30,480
When we released I cut as hard as I could,

697
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:33,980
trying to gain some altitude and keep her from stalling.

698
01:16:34,190 --> 01:16:39,060
We came down like a fucking meteor. And this is how we ended up.

699
01:16:40,630 --> 01:16:43,890
The others stopped easy enough, though.

700
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:47,660
We were just too damn heavy, you know?

701
01:16:47,870 --> 01:16:53,100
The grass was wet. Downward slope and all.

702
01:16:53,310 --> 01:16:55,600
22 guys dead.

703
01:16:57,940 --> 01:17:01,850
-All that for a general?  -One man.

704
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,850
There's a lot of that going around. "FUBAR."

705
01:17:07,720 --> 01:17:09,710
-"FUBAR."  -"FUBAR."

706
01:17:10,420 --> 01:17:14,450
"FUBAR."  -You all got that right.

707
01:17:14,660 --> 01:17:17,360
I looked it up in a German dictionary. "FUBAR"'s not there.

708
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:20,090
Upham! There are more paratroopers out there.

709
01:17:20,300 --> 01:17:22,630
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

710
01:17:22,840 --> 01:17:25,770
You might want to check this out, sir.

711
01:17:25,970 --> 01:17:29,460
Dog tags. More than I really want to count, sir.

712
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:34,380
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

713
01:17:34,610 --> 01:17:39,310
-Jackson. Start going through those.  -Yes, sir.

714
01:17:40,390 --> 01:17:41,550
I'll help.

715
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:49,050
-Do you think that little prick's in there?  -If he is,I'm going to find him.

716
01:17:49,260 --> 01:17:51,990
I bet that son of a bitch... I've got money saying he's still alive.

717
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:56,000
0 bucks says I nail him first. Let's see what we've got in here.

718
01:17:56,200 --> 01:17:59,070
You mugs don't stand a chance. Do you think he's in here?

719
01:17:59,270 --> 01:18:01,900
Just keep looking. Alright.

720
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:07,310
"Gary lanico", "Ben Rubino", "Mike Cesario"...All the Guineas are buying it.

721
01:18:07,510 --> 01:18:11,920
Come on, it's not the right name! 'Wee Willie Winkie". A buddy of yours.

722
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:14,650
We've got to find this prick.

723
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:20,920
Where's this son of a bitch?

724
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,430
Don't mix them up. Keep them in your pile.

725
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:25,930
How am I supposed to know who we've got?

726
01:18:26,130 --> 01:18:28,760
Why don't you just shut up, Reiben?

727
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:33,200
Everybody be friends. Cranky there, huh?

728
01:18:33,410 --> 01:18:36,270
-I think I've got a winner.  -What are you talking about?

729
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,710
"Ryan." Ryan?

730
01:18:38,910 --> 01:18:42,440
Take a look at that, Mellis. You're really a genius.

731
01:18:42,650 --> 01:18:47,180
"R-l-E-N-N-E." That's "Rienne" and it's French. Do you know what that means?

732
01:18:47,390 --> 01:18:49,980
It means "nothing". What beats three of a kind?

733
01:18:50,190 --> 01:18:54,560
I got shit here, all guys from New York. You're always bitching.

734
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,700
Do you need a hand? I've got a full house.

735
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,890
I've got you beat. Straight flush.

736
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,370
You're looking at my cards. You're cheating.

737
01:19:03,570 --> 01:19:07,510
Fucking unreal, this guy. Can you read that shit?

738
01:19:07,740 --> 01:19:12,300
Jesus, look at this poor bastard! I guess they're not bulletproof.

739
01:19:12,510 --> 01:19:13,740
I guess not.

740
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:18,480
I don't like what's between his ears.It's like what's between your legs.

741
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:22,090
We've got to give him that. That's not bad for you, Jackson.

742
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:25,160
I've got three of a kind. What the hell are you doing?

743
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:29,120
The whole goddam Airborne's watching. These aren't poker chips.

744
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:31,800
Alright. Put them back in there.

745
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,180
He's not here.

746
01:20:02,730 --> 01:20:05,160
Maybe we should split into groups?

747
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:07,590
Just wander the woods calling his name.

748
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:10,530
He's bound to hear us sooner or later. Ryan!

749
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:14,300
That might be a little hard to do, Captain.

750
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:21,280
Maybe the locals have seen him. Ryan, James Ryan?

751
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:25,140
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan, 101st Airborne? You know Ryan?

752
01:20:25,350 --> 01:20:30,250
Private James Ryan from lowa? Anybody know a Ryan?

753
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:33,890
James Ryan! Hey, Joe!

754
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:38,360
Doesn't Michaelson pal around with a Ryan from C Company?

755
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:41,830
I think so. Bring him up.

756
01:20:51,210 --> 01:20:53,440
-You know Private Ryan?  -You have to speak up...

757
01:20:53,650 --> 01:20:56,840
You have to speak up, sir! My hearing is not so good!

758
01:20:57,050 --> 01:20:59,880
It comes and goes. A grenade went off right by my head.

759
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:04,580
-Got it. Do you know Private Ryan?   -Who?

760
01:21:04,790 --> 01:21:08,280
-Private Ryan? James Ryan?  -Jimmy Ryan?

761
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:11,330
James. James Francis Ryan.

762
01:21:11,530 --> 01:21:14,500
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

763
01:21:14,730 --> 01:21:17,790
Give me a pencil. Something to write on.

764
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:19,490
Quick, a pencil!

765
01:21:21,810 --> 01:21:23,640
Here you are, a small one.

766
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:29,510
Write this down: "James Francis Ryan? Iowa?"

767
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:33,520
"Do you know him?" Read the message! Look!

768
01:21:36,190 --> 01:21:39,960
-Yeah, of course I know him.  -Does he know where he is?

769
01:21:44,030 --> 01:21:47,300
Yeah, we missed our dropzone by about 20 miles

770
01:21:47,500 --> 01:21:50,700
and ended up way over by "Bumville" or some damn place.

771
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:53,960
Him, me and a couple of others were coming here to the rally point.

772
01:21:54,170 --> 01:21:59,810
We ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to Ramelle.

773
01:22:00,010 --> 01:22:02,070
Ramelle? To babysit a bridge.

774
01:22:02,280 --> 01:22:05,220
-That's the last I've seen of him.  -Great! Thank you!

775
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:08,510
-Write "Thank you". Read. Thank you.  -You're welcome!

776
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:10,450
Assemble on me.

777
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,390
Thank you, Lieutenant.

778
01:22:17,060 --> 01:22:19,030
Ramelle.

779
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:25,470
We're here. There. Ramelle is on the Merderet River,right here.

780
01:22:25,710 --> 01:22:27,760
Just to the southwest of us.

781
01:22:27,970 --> 01:22:30,270
You know anything about that bridge we just talk about?

782
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:34,880
Yeah. The target has always been Cherbourg.

783
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:40,210
We can't push on Paris until we take a deep water port and Rommel knows that.

784
01:22:40,420 --> 01:22:44,910
He's going to try to get his armour across the Merderet River anyway he can.

785
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,960
That way he can hit us in the flank when we make the turn for Cherbourg.

786
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:55,900
That makes any village on the river with a bridge solid gold real estate.

787
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,550
Let's go.

788
01:23:27,130 --> 01:23:28,690
Captain.

789
01:24:06,910 --> 01:24:09,770
What the hell is that?

790
01:24:09,980 --> 01:24:12,950
A radar site. It's got to be out of action.

791
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:19,080
Looks like we've got something in that sandbag bunker under the station.

792
01:24:19,320 --> 01:24:23,280
-See it?   -Yeah, that's my guess, too.

793
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:28,390
-What is it?    -Machine gun, probably MG-42.

794
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:32,460
-Is that what got those guys?  -Maybe one of them is Ryan.

795
01:24:32,670 --> 01:24:35,600
No, their patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good.

796
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:40,570
I don't know how fast you are, but if we detour this way quick and quiet,

797
01:24:40,770 --> 01:24:42,470
the Krauts will never even know we were here.

798
01:24:44,110 --> 01:24:47,480
What I'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?

799
01:24:47,680 --> 01:24:51,410
I hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it.

800
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:56,510
I'm with Reiben. I mean, we left those 88s.

801
01:24:57,420 --> 01:25:03,230
For the Air Force. They're not going to spend ordnance on one machine gun.

802
01:25:03,430 --> 01:25:04,690
Captain.

803
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:10,830
We can skip it and still accomplish our mission. This isn't our mission, right?

804
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,230
Is that what you want to do, Mellish?

805
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:15,910
Leave it here so they can ambush another company?

806
01:25:16,140 --> 01:25:21,840
No, I'm simply saying it's seems an unnecessary risk given our objective.

807
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:24,480
Our objective is to win the war.

808
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:31,920
It's just that I don't have a good feeling about this one.

809
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:38,430
When was the last time you felt good about anything?

810
01:25:59,190 --> 01:26:02,180
Alright. Three runners with suppressing fire.

811
01:26:02,420 --> 01:26:05,580
Mellish. You hook to the right, I'll go up the middle.

812
01:26:05,790 --> 01:26:07,720
Who's going left?

813
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:16,530
Who's going left?

814
01:26:20,040 --> 01:26:22,370
I'll do it.

815
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,940
-I go left.   -Alright.

816
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:28,510
Upham, switch off with Jackson and you linger in the rear.

817
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:34,020
We advance and keep pressure on him 'til he has to change out his barrels.

818
01:26:35,850 --> 01:26:37,790
We should be able to hit them from grenade range.

819
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:41,890
-Maybe I should go up the middle?   -The way you run? I don't think so.

820
01:26:42,090 --> 01:26:46,350
-Maybe I should go left,sir.  -Maybe you should shut up!

821
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,430
Reiben, base of fire.

822
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,370
Mags and clips where you can reach them

823
01:27:00,580 --> 01:27:03,310
and extra grenades for the base runners.

824
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:31,220
Hill's clear. Four down and dead! Upham!

825
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:35,030
Grab the gear and get up here! We need water and extra dressing.

826
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:40,030
Get the morphine out of the medical kit!

827
01:28:51,610 --> 01:28:53,850
Son of a bitch! Get some sulfa on there.

828
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,190
Move my legs up. I got them.

829
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,050
Pour sulfa. Listen to my voice.

830
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:00,420
You're going to be alright, Doc.

831
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:04,190
You're fine. You're going on a hospital ship.

832
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:07,070
More sulfa! Move my legs up.

833
01:29:07,270 --> 01:29:10,100
Put my legs up. I've got them.

834
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:12,230
You're going to be OK. It's alright, Doc.

835
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:15,380
Upham, give me your canteen! Come on.

836
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:19,800
We're going to get you out of here. Put some pressure on it.

837
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,170
Am I shot? How does it look? Give him some morphine.

838
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:26,370
How does it look? You're going to be OK.

839
01:29:26,620 --> 01:29:28,170
Here comes the morphine.

840
01:29:28,980 --> 01:29:31,890
Am I shot in the spine?

841
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:35,000
You're OK. Am I shot in the spine?

842
01:29:35,200 --> 01:29:37,180
Lift him up. Move him over.

843
01:29:37,430 --> 01:29:40,050
Put some pressure on. Easy, easy.

844
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:46,830
It's OK, Doc. It's alright.

845
01:29:47,040 --> 01:29:51,030
Wade, you've got an exit wound. It's in the small of your back.

846
01:29:51,270 --> 01:29:54,680
-How big is the hole?   -It's about the size of an acorn.

847
01:29:54,880 --> 01:29:57,310
It's fine. Put him back.

848
01:29:59,550 --> 01:30:03,650
Put some pressure on it. Put some pressure on it.

849
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:06,450
Put some pressure on it!

850
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,420
Put some more pressure on it.

851
01:30:11,090 --> 01:30:13,220
Is there anything bleeding worse than the others?

852
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:16,590
Yeah, right here. Do you know what it is? Right here.

853
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:20,250
I'll put your hand on it. We got some pressure on there.

854
01:30:20,480 --> 01:30:22,310
That's the one.

855
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:26,570
Oh, my God! My liver! It's my liver!

856
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:30,010
Tell us what to do. Tell us how to fix you.

857
01:30:30,210 --> 01:30:32,840
What can we do? Tell us what to do.

858
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:39,180
I could use a little morphine.

859
01:30:39,990 --> 01:30:42,510
More morphine, sir.

860
01:30:42,730 --> 01:30:45,660
OK. OK.

861
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,160
-Sir? What?   -Give it to him.

862
01:30:52,840 --> 01:30:54,930
Give it to him.

863
01:30:58,650 --> 01:31:03,510
I don't want to die! Here you go, Wade. Here it comes.

864
01:31:08,320 --> 01:31:10,120
Give him another one.

865
01:31:17,330 --> 01:31:19,420
Mama...

866
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,190
Mama.

867
01:31:23,400 --> 01:31:27,030
I want to go home, I want go home.

868
01:31:27,970 --> 01:31:30,770
Mama, Mama, Mama...

869
01:31:30,970 --> 01:31:36,500
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama...

870
01:32:16,790 --> 01:32:18,910
Reiben, hold him!

871
01:32:39,170 --> 01:32:40,870
Not yet!

872
01:32:43,080 --> 01:32:46,050
First make him mark and cover Wade's body for Grave Detail.

873
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:50,810
Same thing for the paratroopers down there.

874
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,550
Strip that stuff off him. Check him for intelligence.

875
01:32:53,760 --> 01:32:57,720
Ask this piece of shit if he shot Wade! Ask him!

876
01:32:57,960 --> 01:32:59,390
-Does it matter?   -It does!

877
01:33:03,070 --> 01:33:05,860
Shut up with that filthy pig Latin.

878
01:33:07,740 --> 01:33:10,710
Jackson, are you hit?

879
01:33:13,710 --> 01:33:14,970
It just skinned the arm.

880
01:33:15,180 --> 01:33:20,580
Get it cleaned and dressed. You and Sarge watch the perimeter.

881
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:26,810
He says, "Please don't shoot." I don't care what he says, Upham.

882
01:33:28,120 --> 01:33:31,020
Sir? Sir, are you going to let them kill him?

883
01:33:32,090 --> 01:33:36,360
This is not right, sir. You can help him with the bodies.

884
01:33:38,730 --> 01:33:40,830
What is happening?

885
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:34,040
American.

886
01:35:34,250 --> 01:35:36,150
I like American.

887
01:35:43,530 --> 01:35:46,050
Steamboat Willie.

888
01:35:46,260 --> 01:35:50,630
Steamboat Willie. Steamboat Willie. American.

889
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:07,780
He says he's not finished. That's what you think. Come on.

890
01:36:15,820 --> 01:36:19,620
Please! I like America!

891
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:22,830
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

892
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:26,500
Go fly a kite! Cat got your tongue! Cool beans!

893
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:33,170
Betty Boop! What a dish.

894
01:36:33,410 --> 01:36:35,470
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

895
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:45,350
I say can you see

896
01:36:45,550 --> 01:36:48,490
I say can you see

897
01:36:48,690 --> 01:36:50,780
I say...

898
01:36:57,700 --> 01:36:59,360
Fuck Hitler.

899
01:37:01,370 --> 01:37:03,360
Fuck Hitler!

900
01:37:12,150 --> 01:37:16,310
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade. He says he's sorry about Wade.

901
01:37:16,520 --> 01:37:18,150
Captain!

902
01:37:18,350 --> 01:37:21,880
Captain, this isn't right. You know this.

903
01:37:22,090 --> 01:37:26,890
He's a prisoner. He surrendered. He surrendered, sir!

904
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:38,930
Tell him...

905
01:37:41,240 --> 01:37:46,110
to march 1,000 paces in that direction.Then he can take off the blindfold.

906
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:48,980
He turns himself in to the first Allied patrol.

907
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:50,780
Are you kidding? We're letting him go?

908
01:37:50,990 --> 01:37:54,680
He's a POW, Reiben. We can't take him with us.

909
01:37:54,890 --> 01:37:59,490
Our guys will pick him up. That was a close shave.

910
01:37:59,700 --> 01:38:01,660
Lucky Strikes.

911
01:38:05,530 --> 01:38:07,700
Take me out to the ball game...

912
01:38:07,900 --> 01:38:13,600
Only if he doesn't get picked up by his own and get thrown back into circulation.

913
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:19,050
Captain, you just let the enemy go. This is such bullshit.

914
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:23,080
You all got that right. Bullshit? This is bullshit?

915
01:38:23,290 --> 01:38:25,850
Shooting a prisoner is OK? It's against the rules!

916
01:38:26,050 --> 01:38:30,460
The goddam rules just walked off with your new friend.

917
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:35,330
But I guess that was the decent thing to do, Captain?

918
01:38:42,970 --> 01:38:45,440
Get your gear. Let's go.

919
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:50,110
You heard him. Gear up.

920
01:38:51,180 --> 01:38:54,440
The Captain just gave you an order. Yeah.

921
01:38:54,650 --> 01:38:58,380
Like the one he gave to take this machine gun. That was a real doozy.

922
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:00,020
You're out of line!

923
01:39:00,260 --> 01:39:03,190
That was one hell of a call coming to take this nest,

924
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:06,330
but what the hell, we only lost one of our guys going for it.

925
01:39:06,530 --> 01:39:09,790
I hope Mama Ryan's really happy knowing that little Jimmy's life

926
01:39:10,000 --> 01:39:12,360
was more important than two of our guys!

927
01:39:12,570 --> 01:39:15,560
But then, we haven't found them, have we?

928
01:39:17,340 --> 01:39:18,770
Hey... Get off me!

929
01:39:18,970 --> 01:39:21,340
Reiben, get up.

930
01:39:22,610 --> 01:39:25,980
Gear up. Fall in.

931
01:39:30,690 --> 01:39:33,120
I'm done with this mission.

932
01:39:37,990 --> 01:39:40,480
Hey! Hey!

933
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:43,350
Sir... Don't you walk away from your captain!

934
01:39:43,600 --> 01:39:45,790
-Reiben, get back in line!   -No, sir.

935
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:48,700
I'll spend the rest of my life in the stockade rather than go on.

936
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,300
I'm not going to ask you again. Captain!

937
01:39:51,510 --> 01:39:53,910
This is bullshit! Fall in!

938
01:39:54,110 --> 01:39:57,340
-Are you going to shoot me over Ryan?   -No, because I don't like you.

939
01:39:57,550 --> 01:39:59,740
If he wants to go, just let him go!

940
01:39:59,950 --> 01:40:03,180
Are you letting this happen? Captain! You see this?

941
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:06,320
Captain. Sir, Ryan's dead.

942
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:08,920
Bullshit! We have a situation here.

943
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,520
I have a sixth sense. I know it in my bones.

944
01:40:11,730 --> 01:40:14,390
We didn't kill the Kraut. Now you're going to shoot me.

945
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,890
-He's better than you.  -Just do it!

946
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:21,500
-Put one in my leg...  -I'll shoot you in your big mouth!

947
01:40:21,700 --> 01:40:23,360
Put your money where your mouth is and do it!

948
01:40:23,570 --> 01:40:26,200
You don't know how to shut up.

949
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:31,000
-Captain, please!  -What's the pool on me up to?

950
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:34,510
-You are a coward son of a bitch!  -I'm waiting, Sarge.

951
01:40:34,720 --> 01:40:37,780
What's the pool on me up to right now?

952
01:40:37,990 --> 01:40:40,280
What's it up to?

953
01:40:40,490 --> 01:40:43,320
What is it? 300 dollars, is that it?

954
01:40:43,530 --> 01:40:45,760
I'm a schoolteacher.

955
01:40:49,330 --> 01:40:52,600
I teach English Composition...

956
01:40:52,800 --> 01:40:55,170
in this little town called Addley, Pennsylvania.

957
01:40:55,370 --> 01:41:00,500
In the last 11 years, I've been at Thomas Alva Edison High School.

958
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:06,980
I was the coach of the baseball team in the springtime.

959
01:41:09,020 --> 01:41:10,750
I'll be doggone.

960
01:41:10,950 --> 01:41:14,390
Back home, when I tell people what I do for a living

961
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:18,290
they think, 'Well, that figures."

962
01:41:19,360 --> 01:41:23,090
But over here, it's...

963
01:41:23,300 --> 01:41:27,600
a big, big mystery.

964
01:41:28,870 --> 01:41:32,770
So, I guess I've changed some.

965
01:41:34,140 --> 01:41:37,310
Sometimes I wonder if I've changed so much

966
01:41:37,510 --> 01:41:41,570
my wife is even going to recognise me whenever I get back to her...

967
01:41:43,490 --> 01:41:46,350
and how I'll ever be able to...

968
01:41:48,590 --> 01:41:51,490
tell her about days like today.

969
01:41:53,800 --> 01:41:56,890
Ryan...

970
01:41:57,100 --> 01:42:00,590
I don't know anything about Ryan. I don't care.

971
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:02,800
He means nothing to me, it's just a name,

972
01:42:03,040 --> 01:42:10,240
but if going to Ramelle and finding him so he can go home,

973
01:42:10,450 --> 01:42:14,250
if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, then...

974
01:42:14,450 --> 01:42:17,440
...then that's my mission.

975
01:42:18,590 --> 01:42:23,990
You want to leave? You want to go off and fight the war?

976
01:42:26,230 --> 01:42:28,860
Alright.

977
01:42:29,060 --> 01:42:35,990
Alright, I won't stop you. I'll even put in the paperwork.

978
01:42:36,240 --> 01:42:41,010
I just know that with every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel.

979
01:44:05,790 --> 01:44:10,730
by memories of days gone by

980
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:17,500
In my solitude you taunt me

981
01:44:17,710 --> 01:44:22,470
with memories that never die

982
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:27,510
I sit in my chair filled with despair

983
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:32,680
There's no one could be so sad

984
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:37,320
With gloom everywhere I sit and I stare

985
01:44:37,530 --> 01:44:42,020
I know that I'll soon go mad

986
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:53,330
Half-track! Cover!

987
01:45:09,090 --> 01:45:12,990
Who's doing the shooting? Who's doing the shooting?

988
01:45:33,480 --> 01:45:35,920
Get ready to move. Take their left flank!

989
01:45:36,150 --> 01:45:38,350
Hold on and make sure they're down.

990
01:45:59,870 --> 01:46:03,000
101st! We're coming out!

991
01:46:09,980 --> 01:46:12,920
That was a recon. element, 2nd SS.

992
01:46:14,320 --> 01:46:17,780
We've been expecting a probe. That must have been it.

993
01:46:19,690 --> 01:46:22,990
Captain Miller, Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

994
01:46:23,200 --> 01:46:25,290
Corporal Henderson, Easy Company, 501st.

995
01:46:25,500 --> 01:46:29,330
Ryan, First of 506th. Toynbee, Third of 506th.

996
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:35,270
-James Francis Ryan?  -Yes,sir.How did you guess that?

997
01:46:46,050 --> 01:46:52,390
-Looks like you got hit pretty hard.  -Yes,sir.Small unit action.

998
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:59,130
They came in and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

999
01:47:04,640 --> 01:47:08,040
Tell you what. If you're our relief, I'm going to file a complaint.

1000
01:47:08,280 --> 01:47:10,710
I wouldn't blame you.

1001
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:14,140
Who's your CO?

1002
01:47:14,350 --> 01:47:16,980
It would've been Captain Jennings.

1003
01:47:17,190 --> 01:47:20,310
I'm afraid the best we can muster up now is a corporal.

1004
01:47:21,760 --> 01:47:24,730
So what are you guys all about?

1005
01:47:24,960 --> 01:47:28,450
We're here for him. Ryan.

1006
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,530
Me, sir?

1007
01:47:39,470 --> 01:47:42,710
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1008
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:48,040
Yes, sir. Peyton,Iowa, that's correct. What is this about?

1009
01:47:50,080 --> 01:47:52,780
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1010
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:01,700
Which ones?

1011
01:48:04,270 --> 01:48:06,560
All of them.

1012
01:48:14,580 --> 01:48:17,200
On the level?

1013
01:48:18,550 --> 01:48:21,910
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1014
01:48:23,180 --> 01:48:25,120
You might want to take some time with this.

1015
01:48:25,350 --> 01:48:28,620
If there's someplace you want to go and...

1016
01:48:37,400 --> 01:48:40,230
-What's this all about?  -Ryan lost his brothers.

1017
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:43,460
-Which one?  -All of them.

1018
01:48:51,780 --> 01:48:54,480
You came all the way out here to tell me that?

1019
01:48:56,850 --> 01:49:00,080
You're going home.

1020
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:03,020
Our orders are to bring you back.

1021
01:49:06,530 --> 01:49:08,720
Bring me back?

1022
01:49:10,300 --> 01:49:15,100
Corporal,I don't mean to leave you more short-handed,but orders are orders.

1023
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,930
Any communications about when you will be relieved?

1024
01:49:18,140 --> 01:49:21,070
We can't tell. We don't know what's happening south of us.

1025
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:24,640
My orders don't include me abandoning my post.

1026
01:49:24,850 --> 01:49:27,470
I understand that, but this changes things.

1027
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,950
I don't see that it does, sir.

1028
01:49:31,590 --> 01:49:35,180
The Chief of Staff for the US Army says it does.

1029
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:37,590
Our orders are to hold this bridge at all costs.

1030
01:49:37,790 --> 01:49:40,890
Our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the Merderet,

1031
01:49:41,100 --> 01:49:43,890
with the exception of two: one at Valognes and this one.

1032
01:49:44,100 --> 01:49:46,590
If the Germans take it, we'll have to displace.

1033
01:49:46,830 --> 01:49:51,740
Private.It's one thing that your outfit wants to stay,but your party's over here.

1034
01:49:51,970 --> 01:49:53,840
I can't leave before the reinforcements are here.

1035
01:49:54,040 --> 01:49:56,440
You've got three minutes to get your gear.

1036
01:49:56,640 --> 01:50:00,380
-What about them,there's barely...  -Hey,asshole!

1037
01:50:00,580 --> 01:50:04,480
Two of our guys already died trying to find you.

1038
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:12,930
-Sir?  -That's right.

1039
01:50:22,500 --> 01:50:26,840
-What were their names?  -Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1040
01:50:29,010 --> 01:50:30,530
Wade and?

1041
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:33,580
Caparzo.

1042
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:48,230
It doesn't make any sense.

1043
01:50:50,370 --> 01:50:54,500
It doesn't make any sense, sir. Why do I deserve to go?

1044
01:50:54,700 --> 01:50:57,570
Why not any of these guys? They all fought just as hard as me.

1045
01:51:02,540 --> 01:51:05,640
Is that what they're supposed to tell your mother

1046
01:51:05,850 --> 01:51:08,910
when they send her another folded American flag?

1047
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:19,420
Tell her that when you found me I was here,

1048
01:51:19,630 --> 01:51:22,390
and I was with the only brothers that I have left,

1049
01:51:22,600 --> 01:51:26,680
and that there was no way I was going to desert them.

1050
01:51:26,900 --> 01:51:32,070
I think she'll understand that. There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1051
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:17,180
What are your orders?

1052
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:22,980
Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here.

1053
01:52:23,220 --> 01:52:25,750
Our world has taken a turn for the surreal.

1054
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:29,390
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1055
01:52:29,600 --> 01:52:33,460
I don't know. What do you think?

1056
01:52:33,670 --> 01:52:36,160
You don't want to know what I think.

1057
01:52:38,240 --> 01:52:40,400
No, Mike, I do.

1058
01:52:43,570 --> 01:52:47,480
Part of me thinks the kid's right. What's he done to deserve this?

1059
01:52:47,680 --> 01:52:51,680
If he wants to stay here, fine. Let's leave him and go home.

1060
01:52:52,690 --> 01:52:54,550
Yeah.

1061
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:59,890
But another part of me thinks, "What if by some miracle we stay

1062
01:53:00,090 --> 01:53:02,860
and actually make it out of here?"

1063
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:06,970
Some day we might look back on this and decide that

1064
01:53:07,200 --> 01:53:11,650
saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we pulled out of

1065
01:53:11,900 --> 01:53:16,670
this whole godawful, shitty mess.

1066
01:53:16,880 --> 01:53:23,680
That's what I was thinking, sir. Like you said, Captain.

1067
01:53:25,190 --> 01:53:30,340
We do that, we all earn the right to go home.

1068
01:53:33,160 --> 01:53:35,290
Oh, brother...

1069
01:53:37,930 --> 01:53:40,870
This is everything.

1070
01:53:41,070 --> 01:53:47,200
You've got the.230 calibre machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1071
01:53:47,410 --> 01:53:50,600
You've got two bazookas, but they've only got eight rounds left.

1072
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,940
And assorted small arms.

1073
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:56,380
We had a.60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.

1074
01:53:56,580 --> 01:53:59,200
Might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.

1075
01:53:59,410 --> 01:54:04,020
Which they're sure to do. What are you thinking, sir?

1076
01:54:04,230 --> 01:54:07,630
I'm thinking I'm going to whip around the flanks.

1077
01:54:11,960 --> 01:54:15,230
Unless we can draw them up the main road between the buildings,

1078
01:54:15,440 --> 01:54:18,920
where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck

1079
01:54:19,160 --> 01:54:21,330
-Disable him?   -If we can.

1080
01:54:21,540 --> 01:54:25,170
Make a 60-tonne roadblock. Then we've got a fighting chance at her flanks.

1081
01:54:25,380 --> 01:54:27,500
Good. Split them up, don't let them mass.

1082
01:54:27,710 --> 01:54:30,580
Hit them hard one-on-one, and fall back to the bridge.

1083
01:54:30,790 --> 01:54:35,120
Machine gun on the move down here, number two up high to piss on them.

1084
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:39,770
That would be the idea. Jackson!

1085
01:54:40,020 --> 01:54:42,330
If we can, I'd like to get you up in that bell tower.

1086
01:54:42,530 --> 01:54:45,560
Yes, sir. I'll give you some company.

1087
01:54:45,800 --> 01:54:51,700
Some company couldn't hurt. A.30 with about a 1,000 rounds would be OK.

1088
01:54:51,930 --> 01:54:53,870
Parker, job opportunity.

1089
01:54:54,110 --> 01:54:55,860
It's not the worst idea ever,

1090
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:59,740
but everything depends on getting the tank down the road for us to knock out.

1091
01:54:59,950 --> 01:55:03,280
How the hell do you plan on doing that?

1092
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:06,140
He's right. As our colleague from Airborne pointed out

1093
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:08,610
what we've got is a bunch of spit wads.

1094
01:55:08,810 --> 01:55:12,660
How do we stop the tank if we get it to commit?

1095
01:55:12,860 --> 01:55:14,330
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1096
01:55:15,350 --> 01:55:18,020
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1097
01:55:18,690 --> 01:55:20,020
Yeah, but with what?

1098
01:55:22,500 --> 01:55:27,290
-We could try a sticky bomb.  -Sticky bomb, sir?

1099
01:55:27,500 --> 01:55:29,660
Sir, are you making that up?

1100
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:33,070
No, it's in the field manual. Check it out, if you want to.

1101
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:37,410
We seem to be out of field manuals. Perhaps you could enlighten us.

1102
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:40,850
You have some demolition, don't you? TNT or Composition B?

1103
01:55:41,060 --> 01:55:45,240
Plenty. I've got that bridge wired with enough Composition B to blow it twice.

1104
01:55:45,450 --> 01:55:46,940
You can spare some, then.

1105
01:55:47,720 --> 01:55:54,090
You take a standard GI sock, cram it full with Composition B,

1106
01:55:54,290 --> 01:55:59,300
and rig up a simple fuse. Then you coat the whole thing with axle grease.

1107
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:02,900
That way, when you throw it, it should stick.

1108
01:56:03,100 --> 01:56:05,570
It's a bomb that sticks. It's a sticky bomb.

1109
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:09,710
Come up with a better way to knock the tracks off a tank, I'm all ears.

1110
01:56:09,940 --> 01:56:13,430
This is good. Now we have to surrender our socks!

1111
01:56:27,970 --> 01:56:29,560
Haul away.

1112
01:56:43,240 --> 01:56:47,610
Select the field of fire. Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1113
01:56:47,810 --> 01:56:49,750
I can cover 12 to 9 from here.

1114
01:56:54,020 --> 01:56:56,510
Easy! I've got her!

1115
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:32,560
Here are the mines.

1116
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:45,710
For being the best we can do,

1117
01:57:45,910 --> 01:57:50,770
that forward machine gun is not in a terrible firing position.

1118
01:57:52,440 --> 01:57:54,880
And this position right here...

1119
01:57:57,110 --> 01:57:59,140
This is the Alamo.

1120
01:57:59,380 --> 01:58:02,720
They push us this far, the last man alive blows the bridge.

1121
01:58:02,920 --> 01:58:05,790
We've only got a 30-second delay on the fuse, so tell everyone

1122
01:58:05,990 --> 01:58:10,620
that if you're last you'd better hurry or you'll not live long.

1123
01:58:11,500 --> 01:58:15,430
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1124
01:58:15,670 --> 01:58:20,000
Never more than two feet away from me. And that's not negotiable.

1125
01:58:21,040 --> 01:58:24,440
I'm going to get some ammo. Come on.

1126
01:58:26,580 --> 01:58:29,810
Hey, Upham, listen to me. Yes.

1127
01:58:30,010 --> 01:58:32,380
-Are you listening?  -Yes.

1128
01:58:32,580 --> 01:58:36,210
We're going to be displacing and falling back like crazy sons of bitches,

1129
01:58:36,420 --> 01:58:40,950
so you've got to be Johnny-on-the-spot with the ammo,or we're dead.

1130
01:58:41,190 --> 01:58:42,590
-Do you understand?  -Johnny-on-the-spot.

1131
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:46,660
-Yeah. Are you alright?  -Yeah.

1132
01:58:47,970 --> 01:58:51,090
When we shipped out of England we got cigarettes

1133
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,070
and I said, "No, thank you. I don't smoke."

1134
01:58:58,680 --> 01:59:02,700
-Quite a situation, huh?  -Unbelievable.

1135
01:59:02,950 --> 01:59:08,720
Yeah. "Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition", right?

1136
01:59:08,920 --> 01:59:11,390
You've got that right.

1137
01:59:13,190 --> 01:59:16,520
-"FUBAR"!   -Alright!

1138
01:59:16,730 --> 01:59:17,960
Ouch.

1139
01:59:18,160 --> 01:59:22,260
Yeah, well... It's going to be a real show, huh?

1140
01:59:22,470 --> 01:59:24,400
Yeah, OK.

1141
01:59:30,510 --> 01:59:32,370
Take it easy.

1142
01:59:33,310 --> 01:59:34,940
"FUBAR."

1143
02:00:12,820 --> 02:00:15,880
Who's that singing, sir?

1144
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:18,050
Edith Piaf.

1145
02:00:19,560 --> 02:00:22,820
What is she so upset about?

1146
02:00:23,030 --> 02:00:28,160
Her lover left her, but she still sees his face everywhere she goes.

1147
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,230
That would do it.

1148
02:01:00,430 --> 02:01:03,630
"Even life itself only represents you."

1149
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:09,030
"Sometimes I dream that I'm in your arms."

1150
02:01:09,270 --> 02:01:12,670
What was that? She sang it before. The chorus.

1151
02:01:12,910 --> 02:01:14,610
The chorus.

1152
02:01:14,810 --> 02:01:17,710
"And you speak softly in my ear."

1153
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:24,380
"And you say things that make my eyes close."

1154
02:01:26,720 --> 02:01:28,520
"And I find that marvellous."

1155
02:01:28,730 --> 02:01:31,960
Again, Upham...

1156
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:37,400
...to be honest, I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1157
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,090
Marvellous.

1158
02:01:39,340 --> 02:01:43,070
It's a really melancholy song. At the beginning of the song she says:

1159
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:49,080
"And then one day you left me and I've been desperate ever since."

1160
02:01:49,280 --> 02:01:52,250
"I see you all over the sky, I see you all over the earth."

1161
02:01:52,480 --> 02:01:55,880
Any more songs like this, the Krauts won't have to shoot me.

1162
02:01:56,120 --> 02:01:58,750
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1163
02:01:58,960 --> 02:02:01,390
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1164
02:02:01,630 --> 02:02:03,560
I'm sorry. It's Edith, you know.

1165
02:02:03,790 --> 02:02:05,560
You know what that song reminds me of?

1166
02:02:05,760 --> 02:02:09,930
Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz and what she said when I left for Basic.

1167
02:02:10,130 --> 02:02:12,570
What? "Don't touch me?"

1168
02:02:12,800 --> 02:02:15,240
No. She's our Super's wife.

1169
02:02:15,440 --> 02:02:21,870
She comes into my mum's shop to try a few things. She's like a 44 Double E.

1170
02:02:22,110 --> 02:02:23,740
Double E? They're massive.

1171
02:02:23,950 --> 02:02:25,310
Those are big titties.

1172
02:02:25,520 --> 02:02:29,480
I've got her convinced that she's a 42 D. So we're in the dressing room

1173
02:02:29,720 --> 02:02:33,680
and she tries to get into this side-cut,silk-ribboned,triple-panel girdle

1174
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:36,260
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1175
02:02:36,460 --> 02:02:38,790
It's beautiful. She's pouring out of this thing.

1176
02:02:39,000 --> 02:02:40,730
-Is it tight?  -No, it's beautiful.

1177
02:02:40,930 --> 02:02:45,060
She sees me and can tell I've got a hard-on the size of the Statue of Liberty.

1178
02:02:45,270 --> 02:02:48,640
She says, "Richard, calm down", and she says,

1179
02:02:48,840 --> 02:02:52,740
"Over there, if you see anything that upsets you, if you're scared,"

1180
02:02:52,940 --> 02:02:59,350
"I want you to close your eyes and think of these, you understand?"

1181
02:02:59,580 --> 02:03:02,070
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1182
02:03:14,730 --> 02:03:17,670
Are you alright, sir?

1183
02:03:17,900 --> 02:03:20,300
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1184
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:29,410
Is it true you were a teacher back home?

1185
02:03:29,610 --> 02:03:33,340
-Yes.   -That's something I could never do.

1186
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:37,680
Not with the way me and my brothers treated our teachers. No, sir!

1187
02:03:40,420 --> 02:03:43,450
I had a thousand kids like you.

1188
02:03:49,130 --> 02:03:52,970
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1189
02:03:53,170 --> 02:03:58,010
I've been trying and I can't see their faces at all. Has that happened to you?

1190
02:03:58,210 --> 02:04:00,640
You've got to think of a context.

1191
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:04,770
What does that mean?

1192
02:04:05,020 --> 02:04:08,710
You don't just think about their faces, you think about something specific,

1193
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:11,250
something you've done together.

1194
02:04:14,960 --> 02:04:17,760
When I want to think of home, I think of something specific.

1195
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:21,760
I think of my hammock in the backyard, -

1196
02:04:21,970 --> 02:04:27,340
or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.

1197
02:04:30,640 --> 02:04:36,100
This one night, two of my brothers woke me up in the middle of the night.

1198
02:04:37,850 --> 02:04:41,180
They said they had a surprise for me.

1199
02:04:41,390 --> 02:04:44,550
They took me to the barn up into the loft

1200
02:04:44,760 --> 02:04:48,660
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1201
02:04:48,890 --> 02:04:51,880
with Alice Jardine!

1202
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:58,930
Picture a girl who just took a nosedive from the ugly tree

1203
02:04:59,170 --> 02:05:02,370
and hit every branch coming down!

1204
02:05:03,670 --> 02:05:06,230
And Dan's got her shirt off...

1205
02:05:06,480 --> 02:05:13,180
So he's trying to get her bra off and all of a sudden Sean screams out

1206
02:05:13,380 --> 02:05:17,340
"Danny, you're a young man. Don't do it!"

1207
02:05:19,090 --> 02:05:22,580
Alice Jardine hears this and she screams and jumps up

1208
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:26,230
and tries to run out, but she's got her shirt over her head.

1209
02:05:26,430 --> 02:05:30,260
She runs into the wall and knocks herself out.

1210
02:05:30,470 --> 02:05:34,370
Now Dan is so mad at us. He starts coming after us,

1211
02:05:34,570 --> 02:05:38,910
but at the same time Alice is unconscious. He's got to wake her up.

1212
02:05:39,110 --> 02:05:41,810
He grabs her by a leg and drags her

1213
02:05:42,010 --> 02:05:45,350
and at the same time he picks up a shovel and goes after Sean!

1214
02:05:45,550 --> 02:05:50,450
And Sean says, 'Why are you trying to hit me? I just did you a favour!"

1215
02:05:51,390 --> 02:05:55,220
This makes Dan more angry. He tries to swing this thing.

1216
02:05:55,430 --> 02:05:59,120
He loses his shovel. It goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.

1217
02:05:59,330 --> 02:06:04,930
The thing explodes. The whole barn almost goes up because of this thing.

1218
02:06:19,020 --> 02:06:22,350
That was it, that was the last... Dan went off to Basic the next day.

1219
02:06:22,550 --> 02:06:26,220
That was the last night the four of us were together.

1220
02:06:26,420 --> 02:06:28,450
That was two years ago.

1221
02:06:30,560 --> 02:06:32,620
Oh, my.

1222
02:06:33,730 --> 02:06:38,430
Tell me about your wife and those rose bushes.

1223
02:06:38,640 --> 02:06:43,540
No. No, that one I save just for me.

1224
02:07:49,110 --> 02:07:50,770
Enemy from the east.

1225
02:07:52,440 --> 02:07:57,000
He sees two Tiger tanks, two Panzer tanks.

1226
02:07:57,250 --> 02:08:01,150
Infantry. 50 plus change.

1227
02:08:10,030 --> 02:08:13,020
Disperse! You know what to do. Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1228
02:08:13,260 --> 02:08:17,500
Upham, get some cover. Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1229
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:20,190
Everybody check your ammo!

1230
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:25,100
-Good luck,Reiben!  -I don't need any luck,I was born lucky!

1231
02:08:38,160 --> 02:08:41,490
One in five tracer. Yes, and tracers point both ways.

1232
02:08:41,690 --> 02:08:44,960
Why don't you check the head space and she should run.

1233
02:08:53,370 --> 02:08:56,240
Upham, hustle up!

1234
02:09:45,990 --> 02:09:49,890
Corporal Upham. We don't have a.30 calibre machine gun here.

1235
02:09:50,090 --> 02:09:55,550
Either Mister Mellish or Mr Jackson in the bell tower needs that.

1236
02:09:55,800 --> 02:09:58,860
Upham! Jackson's fine, turn around to Mellish!

1237
02:10:20,390 --> 02:10:24,120
There's a ton of infantry. I don't know if they took the bait, though.

1238
02:10:48,250 --> 02:10:50,520
Have you got any more of that?

1239
02:11:36,330 --> 02:11:38,560
The Panzers didn't take the bait.

1240
02:11:43,610 --> 02:11:46,340
The infantry's moving to the left.

1241
02:11:46,540 --> 02:11:49,710
A half-track just went by with about 20 troops.

1242
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:32,380
Mellish, Henderson! Displace!

1243
02:13:53,500 --> 02:13:57,410
Do it, now! Light it up! You! Light it!

1244
02:14:08,720 --> 02:14:13,090
30 infantry on the right flank. Get over there, find a hole and stop them!

1245
02:14:13,290 --> 02:14:15,760
Displace!

1246
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,370
Upham!

1247
02:14:43,150 --> 02:14:46,090
Clear! OK, go!

1248
02:14:46,320 --> 02:14:48,050
Krauts!

1249
02:14:49,660 --> 02:14:51,890
Right flank!

1250
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:30,430
Get down, get down!

1251
02:15:36,840 --> 02:15:39,970
Upham! Thirty cal, hurry!

1252
02:15:40,180 --> 02:15:43,410
Find the Captain, this flank's going to fold!

1253
02:16:38,400 --> 02:16:40,800
Traversing! He's still in this fight!

1254
02:16:42,310 --> 02:16:44,870
No! Ryan, get down, get down!

1255
02:16:57,750 --> 02:16:59,980
Ryan!

1256
02:17:18,240 --> 02:17:20,040
Ryan!

1257
02:17:21,340 --> 02:17:23,640
Keep your mouth shut Get off me!

1258
02:17:23,850 --> 02:17:25,580
-Are you alright?  -Get off of me!

1259
02:17:25,780 --> 02:17:28,250
I'm fine too, Captain. Thanks.

1260
02:17:28,480 --> 02:17:32,940
Hit them from both sides. Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1261
02:17:36,990 --> 02:17:38,430
Grenade!

1262
02:17:40,200 --> 02:17:43,130
20 mill! 20 mill!

1263
02:17:43,330 --> 02:17:44,990
Flak gun, 20 mm. Take it out!

1264
02:17:58,450 --> 02:18:01,850
Heavy weapon in defilade below! I ain't got a shot!

1265
02:18:06,390 --> 02:18:10,720
Pincer move! Parker! Targets eight o'clock, low!

1266
02:18:10,930 --> 02:18:13,020
God grant me strength.

1267
02:18:26,480 --> 02:18:29,640
Let's go, displace! Come on!

1268
02:18:46,030 --> 02:18:49,230
Cover! Upham, cover!

1269
02:19:05,450 --> 02:19:07,510
I'm out of.30 calibre.

1270
02:19:10,950 --> 02:19:13,480
Blessed be the Lord my strength, which teaches my hands to war -

1271
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:16,060
and my fingers to fight.

1272
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:29,090
My goodness and my fortress. My high tower and deliverer.

1273
02:19:32,510 --> 02:19:35,240
My shield and He in whom I trust.

1274
02:19:38,820 --> 02:19:40,840
Here you go, baby.

1275
02:20:03,440 --> 02:20:05,660
Parker, get down!

1276
02:20:26,820 --> 02:20:29,130
Captain, that 20 mm is killing us.

1277
02:20:29,330 --> 02:20:33,880
-We've got to try to flank it somehow.  -Let me get over there for a top shot.

1278
02:20:59,130 --> 02:21:01,060
Upham!

1279
02:21:19,350 --> 02:21:24,210
Upham, Upham! Upham, ammo, goddammit!

1280
02:22:07,330 --> 02:22:11,150
-I'm jammed! Got any.30 calibre?   -I'm out.

1281
02:22:23,240 --> 02:22:25,680
Upham. Upham!

1282
02:23:18,360 --> 02:23:19,920
Reiben!

1283
02:23:23,460 --> 02:23:24,660
Reiben!

1284
02:23:51,820 --> 02:23:56,160
I'm out! I need another bandolier. Anybody got a bandolier?

1285
02:24:27,360 --> 02:24:29,420
You piece of shit!

1286
02:25:13,970 --> 02:25:19,070
Let's stop, let's stop! Listen to me! Stop! No, no, no...

1287
02:25:45,870 --> 02:25:47,630
Fuck!

1288
02:25:55,480 --> 02:25:59,980
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch!

1289
02:26:00,220 --> 02:26:02,310
Son of a bitch!

1290
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:28,110
I'm out! Those.60 rounds...

1291
02:27:28,310 --> 02:27:31,170
-We can use them without the tube.   -How?

1292
02:27:31,380 --> 02:27:34,640
Fuse-arming wire, set back and heave it!

1293
02:27:49,960 --> 02:27:52,360
Panzer schreck!

1294
02:28:09,480 --> 02:28:11,470
Go, go!

1295
02:28:25,930 --> 02:28:28,460
We're going to the Alamo.

1296
02:28:38,340 --> 02:28:40,610
Alamo! Alamo!

1297
02:28:59,830 --> 02:29:03,320
We'll take it. You fall back! You be right behind us!

1298
02:29:03,570 --> 02:29:05,500
As soon as we're in business.

1299
02:29:09,610 --> 02:29:12,040
Displace. Reiben!

1300
02:29:14,310 --> 02:29:16,340
Reload!

1301
02:30:04,530 --> 02:30:06,000
Alright, go!

1302
02:30:07,170 --> 02:30:10,070
We're blowing the bridge! Get off! Off the bridge!

1303
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:37,030
Sarge! Mike, are you alright?

1304
02:30:37,230 --> 02:30:39,630
-I just got the wind knocked out of me.  -Let's go!

1305
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:42,730
Take cover, we're going to blow this bridge!

1306
02:30:44,670 --> 02:30:46,400
Come on!

1307
02:30:51,110 --> 02:30:53,440
Tiger company's coming across the bridge.

1308
02:31:26,180 --> 02:31:29,380
Captain, get behind something!

1309
02:31:55,210 --> 02:31:56,970
Mike!

1310
02:32:01,750 --> 02:32:03,510
Mike!

1311
02:32:45,990 --> 02:32:50,050
Captain, where the hell are you going? Captain, get back here!

1312
02:34:43,180 --> 02:34:44,610
Upham!

1313
02:35:14,270 --> 02:35:16,400
Hang in there.

1314
02:36:01,790 --> 02:36:03,760
Medic!

1315
02:36:06,360 --> 02:36:09,020
Medic! We've got a medic?

1316
02:36:15,670 --> 02:36:19,360
They're tankbusters, sir. P-51s.

1317
02:36:19,570 --> 02:36:21,660
Angels on our shoulders.

1318
02:36:27,680 --> 02:36:29,770
What, sir?

1319
02:36:33,820 --> 02:36:35,880
James...

1320
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:39,250
Earn this.

1321
02:36:42,830 --> 02:36:45,190
Earn it.

1322
02:37:13,530 --> 02:37:16,790
"My dear Mrs Ryan."

1323
02:37:17,000 --> 02:37:20,930
"It's with a profound sense of joy that I write to inform you"

1324
02:37:21,170 --> 02:37:25,470
"that your son, Private James Ryan, is well"-

1325
02:37:25,670 --> 02:37:30,440
"and at this moment on his way home from European battlefields."

1326
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:34,810
"Reports indicate that James did his duty in combat"

1327
02:37:35,010 --> 02:37:38,040
"with great courage and steadfast dedication"

1328
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:42,780
"even after he was informed of the loss your family has suffered"

1329
02:37:43,020 --> 02:37:47,960
"in this great campaign to rid the world of tyranny and oppression."

1330
02:37:48,190 --> 02:37:51,130
"I take great pleasure injoining the Secretary of War, "

1331
02:37:51,360 --> 02:37:56,300
"the men and women of the US Army, and the citizens of a grateful nation"

1332
02:37:56,540 --> 02:38:02,570
"in wishing you good health and many years of happiness with James."

1333
02:38:02,810 --> 02:38:07,270
"Nothing, not even the safe return of a beloved son"

1334
02:38:07,510 --> 02:38:11,510
"can compensate you or the thousands of other American families"

1335
02:38:11,750 --> 02:38:15,050
"who have suffered great loss in this tragic war."

1336
02:38:15,250 --> 02:38:17,150
"I might share with you some words"-

1337
02:38:17,360 --> 02:38:22,820
"which have sustained me through nights of peril, loss and heartache, "

1338
02:38:23,060 --> 02:38:27,050
"and I quote, 'I pray that our heavenly Father"

1339
02:38:27,300 --> 02:38:30,600
"may assuage the anguish of your bereavement"

1340
02:38:30,800 --> 02:38:34,640
"and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost"

1341
02:38:34,840 --> 02:38:37,210
"and the solemn pride that must be yours"

1342
02:38:37,410 --> 02:38:42,680
"to have laid a so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom."

1343
02:38:42,880 --> 02:38:44,850
"Abraham Lincoln."

1344
02:38:45,080 --> 02:38:47,550
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,"

1345
02:38:47,790 --> 02:38:51,120
"George C. Marshall. General, Chief of Staff."

1346
02:39:42,210 --> 02:39:47,200
My family is with me today. They wanted to come with me.

1347
02:39:50,280 --> 02:39:55,620
To be honest with you, I wasn't sure how I would feel coming back here.

1348
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:03,660
Every day, I think about what you said to me that day on the bridge.

1349
02:40:05,500 --> 02:40:09,830
I've tried to live my life the best I could.

1350
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:13,060
I hope that was enough.

1351
02:40:13,310 --> 02:40:17,640
I hope that at least in your eyes...

1352
02:40:17,840 --> 02:40:21,780
l've earned what all of you have done for me.

1353
02:40:35,090 --> 02:40:37,120
James.

1354
02:40:38,660 --> 02:40:41,690
"Captain John H. Miller."

1355
02:40:49,370 --> 02:40:54,310
-Tell me I have led a good life. -What?

1356
02:40:54,550 --> 02:40:56,910
Tell me I'm a good mess.

1357
02:41:04,020 --> 02:41:06,080
You are.
