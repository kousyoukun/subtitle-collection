1
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,710
Dad.

2
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,320
Clear the ramp!

3
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,360
30 seconds!

4
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,750
God be with you!

5
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,990
Port side, stick.
Starboard side, stick.

6
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:38,460
Move fast and clear
those murder holes.

7
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,230
I want to see plenty
of beach between men.

8
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,890
5 men
is a juicy opportunity.

9
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,270
One man´s a waste of ammo.

10
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:47,670
Keep the sand
out of your weapons.

11
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,400
Keep those actions clear.

12
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:51,530
I´ll see you on the beach.

13
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,740
Coxswain:
Open murder holes!

14
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,460
Over the side!

15
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,960
Captain Miller:
Port and starboard, over the side!

16
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,940
Jesus.

17
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,270
Thank you--

18
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,910
I said, what the hell
do we do now, sir?

19
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,910
Sergeant Horvath:
Captain Miller!

20
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,150
Captain Miller!

21
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,590
Captain Miller!

22
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:38,460
Sergeant Horvath!

23
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,790
Move your men off the beach!

24
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,490
Go!

25
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,500
OK, you guys!

26
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:47,560
Get on my ass!
Follow me!

27
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,400
What´s the rallying point?

28
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:51,500
Anywhere but here!

29
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,610
The sea wall!

30
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:07,120
Move up to the sea wall!

31
00:11:07,190 --> 00:11:08,990
Sir, I´m staying!

32
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,120
Clear this beach!
Make way for the others!

33
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,190
This is all we got

34
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,700
between us
and the Almighty!

35
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:18,730
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted!

36
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,260
You stay here,
you´re dead men!

37
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:37,780
Mama!

38
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:39,980
Mama!

39
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,180
Aaaaah!

40
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,200
Soldier:
Stay down! Stay down!

41
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,600
What are you guys?

42
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,540
104th Medical Battalion, sir!

43
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,100
Here to set up
field operations!

44
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,970
Get rid of that crap!

45
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:03,340
rab yourselves some weapons.
Follow me.

46
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,820
Aaaaah!

47
00:12:09,890 --> 00:12:11,510
I´m hit!

48
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:12,890
Brigs!

49
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,260
Get me out of here!

50
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,960
I´m hit low. God!

51
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,500
Medic!

52
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:25,540
Navy Beach Battalion, sir.

53
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,570
We gotta clear these obstacles,
make holes for the tanks.

54
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,370
All the armor´s foundering
in the channel.

55
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,530
Orders, sir.

56
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,100
You go somewhere else.
I´m clearing this one!

57
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,270
Come on, Brigs!

58
00:12:41,550 --> 00:12:42,710
Medic!

59
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,250
Move, move!

60
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,390
Move! Come on!

61
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:32,940
Move!

62
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,900
Aaaaah!

63
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,380
Shore party.

64
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,390
No armor has made it ashore.

65
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,590
We got no D.D. tanks
on the beach.

66
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,760
Dog One is not open.

67
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:05,230
Who´s in command here?

68
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,240
You are, sir!

69
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,770
Sergeant Horvath!

70
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,830
Sir!

71
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:13,140
You recognize where we are?

72
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,680
Right where we´re
supposed to be,

73
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,040
but no one else is!

74
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,600
Soldier: Nobody´s where
they´re supposed to be.

75
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,310
Shore party.

76
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,080
First wave, ineffective.

77
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,280
We do not hold the beach.

78
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,150
Say again,
we do not hold the beach.

79
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:29,690
We´re all mixed up, sir.

80
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:31,850
We got the leftovers
from Fox Company,

81
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,860
Able Company,
and eorge Company!

82
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,000
Shore party.

83
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:42,130
Shore party.

84
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:50,470
Cat-F, Cat-F, C--

85
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,180
Reiben here, sir!

86
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,180
See anybody else?

87
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,880
Jackson, but that´s about it.

88
00:14:57,960 --> 00:15:00,120
Mellish here.

89
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,350
Caparzo! We got Deforest
back there with Wade.

90
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,690
He´s hurt so bad he said
he sprung 100 leaks.

91
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,700
Wade says
he´s all used up.

92
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:09,460
Medical Officer:
Move on to somebody you can help.

93
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:12,830
He´s battalion surgeon, sir!

94
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,730
Get his attention.

95
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,770
- Wade!
- Yo, Doc!

96
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,280
- Wade!
- Wade!
- Wade!

97
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:25,470
- Wade!
- Wade!
- Wade!

98
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,290
All right,
get him off the beach.

99
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,590
I got it!
We stopped the bleeding!

100
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,160
We stopped the bleeding!

101
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:37,750
Fuck!

102
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:41,730
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

103
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,730
Son of a fucking cocksucker!

104
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,240
Come on, Wade!
lt´s Mellish!

105
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,170
Wade!

106
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,970
We found Miller!
Let´s move!

107
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,070
Let´s move!

108
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:56,110
Oh, God, oh, God.

109
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:03,480
This is all?
This is all that´s made it?

110
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:05,180
We got scattered
pretty bad, sir.

111
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,160
There´s bound
to be more of us.

112
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,920
Not enough.
This is not enough.

113
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,120
Dog One exit--

114
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,720
lt´s gotta be that
cut on the right,

115
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,760
or is it the one
on the left? Shit!

116
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,770
No, no. Vierville
is to the west of us.

117
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:17,460
This is Dog One.

118
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:19,020
They´re killing us!

119
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,400
We don´t have
a fucking chance,

120
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,000
and that ain´t fair!

121
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,270
ather weapons and ammo!

122
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:27,610
ather weapons and ammo!

123
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:30,700
Come on, let´s drag
´em in off the sand!

124
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,380
Hey, Reiben,
Reiben, Reiben,

125
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,760
where´s your B.A.R.?

126
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:45,660
Bottom of the channel, sir.
The bitch tried to drown me.

127
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,690
Horvath:
Find a replacement.

128
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,600
Bangalores!
Bring up some bangalores!

129
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,870
renades, grenades!

130
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,430
Get ´em over here!

131
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:02,040
Miller:
Bangalores go up the line!

132
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:04,270
Bangalores go up the line!

133
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,680
Heads up!
Bangers coming your way!

134
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,950
Come on, come on, come on!

135
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,080
Jackson here, sir!

136
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,280
Reiben back, sir!

137
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,230
One more.
Give me one more.

138
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,640
Oh, my God, it hurts!

139
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,000
I´m gonna die!

140
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,440
Oh, my God! Oh, Jesus!

141
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,700
Oh, my God!

142
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,810
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

143
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,710
Almost got it.

144
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,710
Jesus!

145
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,480
Lucky bastard.

146
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,920
Keep it moving.
You got it?

147
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,580
God! God, help me!

148
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,790
You´re not gonna die.
You´re not gonna die.

149
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,830
You´re fine.
Don´t look at it.

150
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:56,590
Bangalores!
Clear the shingle!

151
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,900
Fire in the hole!

152
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,400
Fire in the hole!

153
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,940
Fire in the hole!

154
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,430
Fire in the hole!

155
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:16,680
We´re in business!
Defilade!

156
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,880
Other side of the hole!

157
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,270
Medical Officer:
That´s it! Let´s go!

158
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,870
lnspected. Morphine.

159
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,840
Routine.

160
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,720
Priority.

161
00:18:54,690 --> 00:18:56,450
He´s gone.

162
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,570
Son of a--

163
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,910
Get in there.

164
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,310
Fuck. I can´t move.

165
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,350
Mellish,
give me your bayonet.

166
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:39,000
Miller:
2 M-42s and 2 mortars.

167
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:41,090
Add 20, left 30.

168
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:45,900
There´s a little defilade
over there,

169
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,100
but it´s the perfect
firing position

170
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,700
if we get some goddamn
armor on the beach.

171
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,240
We gotta open up
this draw!

172
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:51,780
We gotta get this draw open.

173
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,840
Reiben, Mellish,
let´s get into the war!

174
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:57,050
rab some cover and put
some fire on that crew.

175
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,380
Davis, Debernardo,

176
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,050
Young, Valk,
get ready.

177
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:04,590
Covering fire!

178
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,360
Go, go, go!

179
00:20:23,510 --> 00:20:25,500
Goddamn firing squad.

180
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,810
lt´s the only way

181
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,710
we can get everybody
the hell out of here.

182
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,280
Short, Payton, McDonald,
Parkes!

183
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,190
You´re next!

184
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,820
Why not just hand out
blindfolds, Cap?

185
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:37,520
All we can do here
is die.

186
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,190
Covering fire!

187
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,030
Go, go, go!

188
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,090
Come on!

189
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:47,030
Come on,
come on!

190
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,500
Go, goddamn it!

191
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,540
Jackson.

192
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,590
Sir.

193
00:21:03,650 --> 00:21:05,380
Do you see
that impact crater?

194
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,390
Yes, sir.

195
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,050
That should give you
complete defilade

196
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,560
from that machine gun
position.

197
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:11,560
Get in there and give me
some fire discipline.

198
00:21:11,630 --> 00:21:13,060
Wait for my command.

199
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:19,400
Go!

200
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:34,080
Captain, if your mother saw you
do that, she´d be very upset.

201
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:36,020
I thought
you were my mother.

202
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,580
Be not Thou far from me,
Go Lord.

203
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,890
Go my God,

204
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,450
I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

205
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:48,590
Go my God,

206
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,100
I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

207
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:52,100
I detest my sins for having
offended Thee, Go Lord.

208
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,730
I detest my sins for having
offended Thee, Go Lord.

209
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,860
Listen to me, Lord.

210
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,110
Go my strength...

211
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,050
haste Thee to help me.

212
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,830
Dog One exit!

213
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,920
Right here!

214
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,730
We´re in business!

215
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,940
Move!

216
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,940
Move!

217
00:23:10,250 --> 00:23:11,180
Reiben.

218
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:12,340
Let´s go, Sarge. Go!

219
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,350
Reiben.

220
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:43,380
Come on, Doyle!

221
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,370
Sarge.

222
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,220
Flame!

223
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,990
Doyle, do it!

224
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:00,700
Don´t shoot!

225
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,460
Let ´em burn!

226
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,720
I´ll give you "comrade,"
you son of a bitch!

227
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,730
Lie down!

228
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,750
Cease fire!

229
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,290
Cease fire!

230
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,290
Cut it out!

231
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,920
Cut it out!
Cease fire!

232
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:04,930
Sugar Cane.

233
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,460
Sugar Charlie 3.

234
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,400
Say again, Dog One is open.
Send in the ´dozers.

235
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:11,430
I´m waiting here
to tie in my flanks.

236
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,990
Over.

237
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,660
What?

238
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:18,560
What?

239
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,570
I´m sorry,

240
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,910
I can´t understand
what you´re saying.

241
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,920
What´d he say?

242
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:31,450
What´d he say?

243
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,460
"Look, I washed
for supper."

244
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,960
Ha ha ha ha!

245
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,170
Hey, Fish.

246
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,170
Yeah?

247
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,930
Look at this.
A Hitler Youth knife.

248
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:55,480
And now it´s a shabbat
challah cutter, right?

249
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:07,120
Soldier:
Keep it moving!

250
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,710
Horvath:
That´s quite a view.

251
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,390
Yes, it is.

252
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,560
Quite a view.

253
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,650
Man´s Voice:
"Dear Mr. Brian Boyd,

254
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,490
no doubt by now you have
received full information..."

255
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,720
Second Man:
"Dear Mrs. Jensen..."

256
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,280
"...about the untimely
death of your son."

257
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,120
"...no words of mine can
ever relieve the grief..."

258
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,660
Third Man: "Our outfit has
felt his loss tremendously."

259
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,130
Fourth Man:
"He was a fine soldier,

260
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,670
and he believed
very strongly in..."

261
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:06,130
Fifth Man:
"lt´s no secret anymore...

262
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,670
that we were involved

263
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,670
in one of the most important
operations of this war."

264
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,670
First Man: "Al was the one
who held us all together.

265
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,300
he was always the first to
volunteer and the last..."

266
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:15,140
Sixth Man: "...came to
a clearing near a road

267
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:16,970
where over 4,000 troops
had passed."

268
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:19,140
Seventh Man: "Your husband
served in a combat unit

269
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:22,150
whose dangerous duty is
to place itself beyond..."

270
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:25,150
Eighth Man: "...which we all
cherish and hold so dear.

271
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,520
The loss of Lee
and others like him

272
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,150
is a distinct blow
to the regiment."

273
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:30,690
Ninth Man: "I fully
understand your desire

274
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:33,700
to learn as much as possible
regarding the circumstances

275
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,160
leading to his death."

276
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,210
Colonel, I´ve got something
you should know about.

277
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,380
Yes?

278
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:35,720
These 2 men died in Normandy.

279
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,730
This one at Omaha Beach.

280
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,130
"Sean Ryan."

281
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,220
This man at Utah.

282
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,290
"Peter Ryan."

283
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,070
This man was killed
last week in New Guinea.

284
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,210
"Daniel...

285
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,640
Ryan."

286
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,650
The 3 men are brothers, sir.

287
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,650
I´ve just learned
that this afternoon

288
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,050
their mother´s going to be
getting all 3 telegrams.

289
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,720
That´s not all.

290
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:11,590
There´s a fourth brother,
the youngest.

291
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,060
He parachuted in
with the 101st Airborne

292
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,600
night before the invasion.

293
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,220
He´s somewhere in Normandy.
We don´t know where.

294
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,600
ls he alive?

295
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,070
We don´t know.

296
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,830
Come with me.

297
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,240
General Marshall:
Goddamn it.

298
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,780
All 4 of them were
in the same company

299
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,410
in the 2th Division,

300
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,950
but we split them up

301
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,450
after the Sullivan brothers
died on the Juneau.

302
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,990
Well, any, uh, contact
with the fourth son, James?

303
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:21,990
No, sir.

304
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,990
He was dropped
about 15 miles inland

305
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,490
near Neuville.

306
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,500
But that´s still deep
behind German lines.

307
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,500
Now, Mac, there is
no way you can know

308
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:31,500
where in the hell
he was dropped.

309
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:33,660
First reports out of
lke´s people at Shaef

310
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:36,000
said the 101st is scattered
all to hell and gone.

311
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:38,010
There´s misdrops
all over Normandy.

312
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:41,340
Assuming Private Ryan
even survived the jump,

313
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,840
he could be anywhere.

314
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:44,500
ln fact,
he´s probably K.I.A.

315
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,010
And frankly, sir,

316
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,520
we go sending some sort
of rescue mission,

317
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,180
flat-hatting through swarms
of German reinforcements

318
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:53,020
all along our axis
of advance,

319
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,850
they´re gonna be K.I.A. too.

320
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,550
I have a letter here...

321
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:25,550
written a long time ago
to a Mrs. Bixby in Boston.

322
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,710
So bear with me.

323
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,730
"Dear Madam,

324
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,890
I have been shown in the files
of the war department

325
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:39,060
a statement of the adjutant
general of Massachusetts

326
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,570
that you...

327
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:42,570
are the mother of 5...

328
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:48,070
sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle.

329
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:54,910
I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine...

330
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,410
that would attempt
to beguile you from the grief...

331
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:02,250
of a loss so overwhelming.

332
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,090
But I cannot refrain
from tendering to you

333
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,600
the consolation
that may be found...

334
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:11,600
in the thanks
of the republic...

335
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,100
they died to save.

336
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,610
I pray that
Our Heavenly Father

337
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,440
may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

338
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,450
and leave you only
the cherished memory

339
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,850
of the loved and lost...

340
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,110
and the solemn pride
that must be yours

341
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:32,120
to have laid so costly
a sacrifice

342
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:34,120
upon the altar of freedom.

343
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:36,620
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully...

344
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:39,130
Abraham Lincoln."

345
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,310
That boy is alive.

346
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,980
We are gonna send somebody
to find him...

347
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:08,160
and we are gonna get him
the hell out of there.

348
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:11,220
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:25,010
We expected 32 tanks
on the beach.

350
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:26,170
27 didn´t make it.

351
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,500
Miller, Charlie Company.

352
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,670
Go on in, Captain.

353
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:30,180
I understand
your situation,

354
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,680
but if we don´t off-load
those ShGermans by 0600,

355
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,510
we´re gonna have
an entire division

356
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,520
stuck at Carentan with
its pants around its ankles.

357
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,520
Well, you let me know.

358
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:41,520
Have Charlie Company
hold at Vierville

359
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,680
until we can get
some armor up there.

360
00:36:43,730 --> 00:36:45,520
Yes, sir.
Runner!

361
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:53,030
Airborne was supposed
to win an open door

362
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,540
for the rest of us.

363
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,700
lnstead they misdropped,

364
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,210
scattered all their
sticks into the wind.

365
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,370
What´s your situation?

366
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,040
Uh, yes, sir.
Sector 4 is secure.

367
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,040
We, uh...

368
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:05,440
we took out towed 88s

369
00:37:05,510 --> 00:37:07,540
here, here...

370
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,710
and here.

371
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,550
They´d already gotten
4 of our ShGermans

372
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,050
and a number of our
deuce-and-a-halves.

373
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:14,560
These 2 minefields
are actually one big one.

374
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:16,560
We tried to make our way up
through the middle of it,

375
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,060
but it turned into a mixed,
high-density field--

376
00:37:19,130 --> 00:37:20,560
little bit of everything.

377
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,220
Sprengmine 44s,
Schumine 42s,

378
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,560
pot mines, A-200s--
the little wGooden bastards

379
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,570
that the mine detectors
don´t pick up.

380
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,570
This road here...

381
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,570
they placed big mushrooms--
Teller mine 43s,

382
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,230
I guess for our tanks--

383
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:35,710
from here right up
to the edge of the village,

384
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,080
right here.

385
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,080
So we marked ´em,
called the engineers.

386
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,410
Resistance?

387
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,580
We had higher support
expectations, sir.

388
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:45,090
There was an understrength
company without artillery.

389
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,590
Wehrmacht 346 lnfantry,
Von Luck Kampfgruppe.

390
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,420
We ended up
with 23 prisoners.

391
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,720
We turned them over
to M.P.s from the 2th.

392
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,430
What about our casualties?

393
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,760
Well...

394
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,600
the figures...

395
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,110
were 35 dead...

396
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,440
times 2 wounded.

397
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,910
They just...

398
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:10,270
didn´t wanna give up
those 88s.

399
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,620
lt was a tough assignment.
That´s why you got it.

400
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,120
Yes, sir.

401
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,620
John...

402
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,450
I´ve got another one
for you.

403
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:24,620
Yes, sir.

404
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:26,850
This one´s straight
from the top.

405
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,970
Miller:
I wish.

406
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,160
You and I are taking
a squad over to Neuville

407
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,500
on a public relations mission.

408
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,510
Horvath:
You leading a squad?

409
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,670
Some private in the 101st
lost 3 brothers,

410
00:38:42,710 --> 00:38:44,340
and he´s got a ticket home.

411
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:45,810
How come Neuville?

412
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,510
They think he´s up there
somewhere,

413
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,520
part of all
those airborne misdrops.

414
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:50,980
lt´s not gonna be easy

415
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,520
finding one
particular soldier

416
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:53,990
in the middle of this
whole goddamn war.

417
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:55,990
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

418
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,680
But what about
the company?

419
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,520
We take the pick
of the litter,

420
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,530
and the rest get folded
into Baker.

421
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
Jesus Christ.

422
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,360
They took away
your company?

423
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,700
lt wasn´t my company,
it was the army´s.

424
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,700
So they told me, anyway.

425
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,210
Give me Reiben on B.A.R.,

426
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:13,540
Jackson, Wade, Beasley
and Caparzo.

427
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:15,200
Beasley´s dead.

428
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,840
All right.
Mellish then.

429
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,380
We got anybody speaks French?

430
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:20,010
Not that I know of.

431
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,380
What about Talbot?

432
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:23,380
This morning.

433
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:24,380
Oh.

434
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,550
All right.

435
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,560
I´m gonna go try to dig up
another interpreter.

436
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,020
Assemble at Battalion
Motor Pool on the beach.

437
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,020
Yes, sir.

438
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:32,560
What are we gonna do?

439
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:33,560
Listen up-- What?

440
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:34,720
What we gonna do?

441
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,230
You´re going home wrapped
in an American flag

442
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,860
with a hunk of cheese
in your ass, Caparzo.

443
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,870
I thought you liked it
in the ass.

444
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,100
What?

445
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,140
Attention!

446
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,640
As you were.

447
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:46,470
I´m looking
for Corporal Upham...

448
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,470
Timothy E.

449
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:48,530
I´m Upham, sir.

450
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:50,310
I understand you speak
French and German.

451
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,310
Yes, sir.

452
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,470
How´s your accent?

453
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,950
Just a slight one
in French,

454
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,480
but my German´s clean.
A touch of Bavarian, sir.

455
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,950
Very good. You´ve
been reassigned to me.

456
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,150
rab your gear.

457
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,410
We´re going to a place
called Neuville.

458
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,420
Yes, sir.

459
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,550
When was this updated?

460
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,960
Updated as of 0830
this morning.

461
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,050
Uh, sir...

462
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,650
this is
the 12th S.S. Panzer.

463
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:07,490
These are the 2 axis
that advance south.

464
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,960
Sir, there are Germans
in Neuville.

465
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,500
That´s what I understand,
Corporal.

466
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:11,970
Um, sir,

467
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,970
there are a lot of Germans
in Neuville.

468
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,500
You have a problem
with that, Corporal?

469
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:16,660
No, sir.

470
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,500
Just if you consider
I´ve never been in combat.

471
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:19,970
I make maps,
and I translate.

472
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,980
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

473
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,980
Yes, sir.

474
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,510
My 2 guys were killed.

475
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,980
lt´s just that
I haven´t held a weapon

476
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:27,520
since basic training, sir.

477
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,520
Did you fire the weapon
in basic training?

478
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,680
Yes, sir.

479
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,520
Well, then get your gear.

480
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:33,520
Yes, sir.

481
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,890
Sir, may I br--

482
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,530
May I bring
my typewriter, sir?

483
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,530
Yes, sir.

484
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,540
Thank you very much, sir.

485
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,010
That a souvenir?

486
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,380
Uh, no, sir.

487
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,210
Take your time, Corporal.

488
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,850
You should look

489
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,550
on the bright side
of things, Corporal.

490
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:07,550
Yes, sir.

491
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,850
For one thing...

492
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,390
you don´t need
to carry those.

493
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,860
You´ll need that.

494
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:14,560
Need this. Yes, sir.
Don´t need that.

495
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:12,590
Hey.

496
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,880
Oh. Hey.

497
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,890
You want your head blown off,
you fancy little fuck?

498
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,430
Don´t you ever
fuckin´ touch me

499
00:42:17,490 --> 00:42:18,890
with those little
rat claws again.

500
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,430
Get the fuck back
in formation.

501
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,060
I was wondering
where you´re from,

502
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,070
that´s--

503
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,910
Caparzo, is it?

504
00:42:31,970 --> 00:42:33,600
Hey, drop dead, Corporal.

505
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,730
ot you.

506
00:42:34,810 --> 00:42:35,900
And another thing,

507
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,450
every time you salute
the captain,

508
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:39,450
you make him a target
for the Germans.

509
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:40,910
Do us a favor.
Don´t do it.

510
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,920
Especially when
I´m standing next to him,

511
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:43,920
capisci?

512
00:42:43,990 --> 00:42:44,920
Uh, capisci.

513
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,610
Corporal,
what´s your book about?

514
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:47,750
Hey, watch your rifle.

515
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,950
Sorry.

516
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,920
lt´s supposed to be about
the bonds of brotherhGood

517
00:42:50,990 --> 00:42:53,930
that develop between
soldiers during war.

518
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,930
BrotherhGood?

519
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,930
What do you know
about brotherhGood?

520
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,930
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

521
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,730
Why don´t you ask
the captain where he´s from?

522
00:43:02,810 --> 00:43:04,430
Yeah, ask the captain.

523
00:43:04,510 --> 00:43:06,340
He´ll tell you everything
you wanna know about him.

524
00:43:07,510 --> 00:43:09,440
You wanna explain
the math of this to me?

525
00:43:09,510 --> 00:43:10,910
I mean,
where´s the sense

526
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,450
of risking the lives
of the 8 of us

527
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:13,910
to save one guy?

528
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,910
20 degrees.

529
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,920
Anybody wanna
answer that?

530
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:17,920
Reiben,

531
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,450
think about the poor
bastard´s mother.

532
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:22,460
Hey, Doc, I got a mother,
all right?

533
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,920
I mean, you got a mother,
Sarge has got a mother.

534
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,460
I mean, shit, I bet even
the captain´s got a mother.

535
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,930
Well, maybe
not the captain,

536
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,360
but the rest of us
got mothers.

537
00:43:31,430 --> 00:43:32,920
"Theirs not to reason why,

538
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,470
theirs but to do and die."

539
00:43:37,370 --> 00:43:39,100
What the fuck is that
supposed to mean, huh?

540
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,540
We´re all supposed
to die, is that it?

541
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,010
Upham´s talking

542
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,840
about our duty
as soldiers.

543
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,000
Upham:
Yes, sir.

544
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,480
We all have orders, and
we have to follow ´em.

545
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:47,570
That supersedes
everything,

546
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:49,050
including your mothers.

547
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,420
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

548
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:52,950
Even if you think
the mission´s FUBAR, sir?

549
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:55,650
Especially if you think
the mission´s FUBAR.

550
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,210
What´s "FUBAR"?

551
00:43:57,290 --> 00:43:58,730
Oh, it´s German.

552
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:02,390
Never heard of that.

553
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,950
Sir...

554
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:06,500
I have an opinion
on this matter.

555
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,300
Well, by all means,
share it with the squad.

556
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:11,670
Well, from my way
of thinking, sir,

557
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,500
this entire mission is
a serious misallocation

558
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,510
of valuable
military resources.

559
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,510
Yeah. Go on.

560
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,980
Well, it seems to me, sir,

561
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,980
that God gave me
a special gift,

562
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:23,810
made me a fine
instrument of warfare.

563
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,150
Reiben, pay attention.

564
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,810
Now, this is the way
to gripe.

565
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:28,980
Continue, Jackson.

566
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,520
Well, what I mean
by that, sir,

567
00:44:30,590 --> 00:44:32,990
is if you was to put me
and this sniper rifle

568
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:35,000
anywhere up to
and including 1 mile

569
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:36,530
of Adolf Hitler

570
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
with a clear line
of sight, sir--

571
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:40,430
Pack your bags, fellas.
War´s over.

572
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:41,430
Amen.

573
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,990
Oh, that´s brilliant,
bumpkin.

574
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,830
Hey, so, Captain,
what about you?

575
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,530
I mean,
you don´t gripe at all?

576
00:44:46,610 --> 00:44:49,340
I don´t gripe to you,
Reiben. I´m a captain.

577
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,710
There´s a chain of command.

578
00:44:50,750 --> 00:44:52,540
ripes go up, not down.
Always up.

579
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,010
You gripe to me,

580
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,710
I gripe to
my superior officer,

581
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,180
so on, so on
and so on.

582
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,550
I don´t gripe to you.

583
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:00,020
I don´t gripe
in front of you.

584
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,560
You should know that
as a ranger.

585
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,560
I´m sorry, sir,
but, uh...

586
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,020
let´s say
you weren´t a captain,

587
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:06,560
or maybe I was a major.

588
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:08,030
What would you say then?

589
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:09,560
Well, in that case,

590
00:45:09,630 --> 00:45:12,360
I´d say this is
an excellent mission, sir,

591
00:45:12,470 --> 00:45:14,560
with an extremely valuable
objective, sir,

592
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:17,070
worthy of
my best efforts, sir.

593
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:19,040
Moreover...

594
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:20,570
I feel heartfelt sorrow

595
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,580
for the mother
of Private James Ryan

596
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,580
and am willing
to lay down my life

597
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:26,050
and the lives of my men,

598
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:28,050
especially you, Reiben,

599
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:29,810
to ease her suffering.

600
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:31,820
He´s good.

601
00:45:31,890 --> 00:45:33,320
I love him.

602
00:45:43,770 --> 00:45:44,860
Right.

603
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:20,900
Woman:
Les Américaines! Les voila!

604
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,900
lis arrivent!
lis viennent nous sauver!

605
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,060
Man: Nous sommes la!
Viens par ici!

606
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,610
Thunder!

607
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,910
Flash!

608
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:31,410
Upham, over there.

609
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:33,410
Reiben, you four go.

610
00:46:42,990 --> 00:46:44,420
Go, go, go, go, go.

611
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,760
You guys are a sight
for sore eyes.

612
00:46:51,830 --> 00:46:53,430
Sergeant Hill,
our relief showed up.

613
00:46:53,540 --> 00:46:54,930
How many are you?

614
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,940
Just 8 of us.
We´re not your relief.

615
00:46:57,010 --> 00:46:57,940
Sorry.

616
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,440
What do you mean, sir?

617
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:01,270
We´re here
for a Private Ryan.

618
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,110
Who? Ryan?
What for?

619
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:04,440
ls he here?

620
00:47:04,550 --> 00:47:05,670
I don´t know.

621
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:07,440
Maybe with a mixed unit
on the other side of town.

622
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,450
Uh-huh.

623
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:09,780
lt´s hard to get to.

624
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:11,280
The Germans punched a hole
in our center,

625
00:47:11,350 --> 00:47:12,650
cut us right in 2.

626
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:14,120
What´s his name again?

627
00:47:14,190 --> 00:47:15,660
Ryan. James Ryan.

628
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:16,950
He dropped in with 101st.

629
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:18,460
Goldman, get me
a runner up here.

630
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:19,650
Runner!

631
00:47:19,730 --> 00:47:20,960
Come on.

632
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:27,470
Jonesy,
make a hole up there!

633
00:47:29,570 --> 00:47:30,660
We got stopped

634
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:32,470
by some intense rifle action
from the eastward.

635
00:47:32,570 --> 00:47:35,480
The Germans have been
reinforcing 2 regiments all day.

636
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:38,480
The streets have been quiet
for about 45 minutes.

637
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:41,480
Most of the German fire now
is concentrated to the west.

638
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,980
Who´s that
on the loudspeaker?

639
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,480
That´s DagwGood Dusseldorf,

640
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,150
our friendly neighborhGood
morale officer.

641
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:49,490
Man On Loudspeaker:
The Statue of Liberty is kaputt.

642
00:47:49,590 --> 00:47:52,990
"The Statue Of Liberty
is kaputt."

643
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:54,650
That´s disconcerting.

644
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,490
Take the second left...

645
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,500
Your father
was circumcised

646
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,500
by my rabbi,
you prick!

647
00:48:03,610 --> 00:48:05,000
...looking for
Private Ryan, James,

648
00:48:05,070 --> 00:48:06,510
probably misdropped
with the 101.

649
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,510
ot that?

650
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,510
Cover!

651
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,180
Go!

652
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:43,040
Those sadistic
fuckin´ animals!

653
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:44,040
Get down.

654
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,550
They know we´re not
in direct contact.

655
00:48:45,650 --> 00:48:47,050
They´re gonna single out
the runners.

656
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,550
Why do they keep
shooting him up?

657
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,050
Long as his lungs
have bGreath in them,

658
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,550
he still carries
the message.

659
00:48:51,650 --> 00:48:53,050
We do the same thing.

660
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:54,050
No, we wouldn´t!

661
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:55,210
Wade!
Get ´em ready to travel.

662
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:56,220
Yes, sir.

663
00:48:56,290 --> 00:48:57,350
Boyd!

664
00:48:57,430 --> 00:48:58,590
Try again.

665
00:48:58,690 --> 00:49:01,060
See if you can let
Captain Hamill know we´re coming.

666
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:02,560
Miller: What´s the rest
of Neuville like?

667
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,060
Uh, next block´s
got 2-story buildings

668
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:06,570
both sides of the street.

669
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:08,070
Backtrack, copy? Over.

670
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:09,800
And then there´s a square
with good cover on the left.

671
00:49:09,870 --> 00:49:10,800
Show me.

672
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:12,310
Sarge, hold right here.

673
00:49:12,370 --> 00:49:13,570
Horvath:
Yes, sir.

674
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,570
Right, let´s stay out
of this enfilade

675
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,080
and use the buildings.

676
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:22,240
Try a left hook.

677
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,080
Shoot ´n´ scoot.
2 of yours, 2 of mine.

678
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:25,590
Hastings, Goldman,
up front!

679
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,590
Let´s go.

680
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:29,090
Reiben, Caparzo.

681
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,590
Boyd:
They´re still jamming us.

682
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:31,920
Fundamentals.
Short runs.

683
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:33,260
High and low
at the corners.

684
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,260
Gonna be tight.

685
00:49:34,330 --> 00:49:35,760
Be prepared
for close contact.

686
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:37,090
Go.

687
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:39,100
Upham, you stay
with Sergeant Horvath.

688
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,260
Stay right here.

689
00:49:40,340 --> 00:49:41,860
I´ll wear him like
underwear, Captain!

690
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,030
Stay with me.

691
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:53,040
Past the end of
the block to the left,

692
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:54,550
those are the gates
to the square.

693
00:49:54,620 --> 00:49:55,550
Good.

694
00:50:03,490 --> 00:50:05,080
Reiben, where´s
the captain from?

695
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,420
You figure
that one out,

696
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,930
you got yourself
a nice prize.

697
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,430
300 bucks,
last I heard.

698
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:10,930
Company´s got a pool.

699
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,020
5 bucks gets you in.

700
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:17,440
Oh, easy.

701
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,440
Ow.

702
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,970
lt´s around this corner.

703
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:22,600
Defilade right up
to those gates.

704
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:26,450
Somebody must know
where he´s from,

705
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,950
what he did
for a living.

706
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,450
I´ve been with him
since Kasserine Pass,

707
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:30,750
and I don´t have a clue.

708
00:50:30,820 --> 00:50:32,450
My ankles
are killing me, man.

709
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,460
I´m gonna need a wheelchair
before this war is over.

710
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:36,460
Ow! That´s it.

711
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:37,960
Oh, my God.

712
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,960
ot ankles
like an old woman.

713
00:50:40,030 --> 00:50:41,460
Like an old...

714
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:42,460
Ow.

715
00:50:42,530 --> 00:50:43,460
God.

716
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:45,790
Reiben...

717
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:47,960
so you don´t even know
where he went to school?

718
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,470
Captain didn´t go to school.

719
00:50:49,540 --> 00:50:51,130
They assembled him at O.C.S.

720
00:50:51,210 --> 00:50:52,970
out of spare body parts
of dead .I.s.

721
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,470
You gotta pay attention
to detail.

722
00:50:54,540 --> 00:50:56,480
I know where he´s from
and exactly what he did

723
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:57,980
´cause I pay attention
to detail.

724
00:50:58,050 --> 00:50:59,480
Hey, Upham...

725
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:02,070
careful you don´t step
in the bullshit.

726
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:08,320
Do it.

727
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:09,480
Thunder!

728
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:10,490
Thunder,

729
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,990
or we will fire on you!

730
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:14,490
Woman:
Ne tirez pas!

731
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,000
On est Francais!

732
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,500
Upham, tell them
to show themselves.

733
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:26,010
Montrez-vous!

734
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:27,510
Montrez-vous!

735
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,510
Man:
On n´est pas armés!

736
00:51:34,350 --> 00:51:35,610
Pourquoi tirez?

737
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,210
Mais baissez vos fusils!
On est Francais!

738
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:38,680
Ask them if they know
where the Germans are.

739
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,190
Oú sount les allemands?

740
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:42,020
Ca vas pas!
lis sont partout!

741
00:51:42,090 --> 00:51:44,520
ll faut vous emmener
les enfants!

742
00:51:44,590 --> 00:51:46,030
Miller:
What is he saying?

743
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,530
Upham:
Something about the children.

744
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,150
They want us to take
the children.

745
00:51:49,230 --> 00:51:51,100
Miller: No, no, no.
We can´t take the kids.

746
00:51:51,170 --> 00:51:52,330
Non ne pouvons pas
les prendre avec nous!

747
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,300
Miller:
We can´t take the kids!

748
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:55,460
No!

749
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:56,770
Upham:
Mais non! Mais non!

750
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,530
Nous ne pouvons pas
les prendre avec nous!

751
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:00,540
They think
they´ll be safe with us.

752
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:03,130
Miller: lt´s not gonna be
safe when they´re with us!

753
00:52:03,210 --> 00:52:04,640
Are you nuts?!

754
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:05,940
Listen to the captain!

755
00:52:06,010 --> 00:52:08,450
They think they´ll be
safe with us, sir.

756
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:10,540
Miller:
Not gonna be safe anywhere.

757
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,110
Caparzo!

758
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,550
Put that kid back!

759
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,250
lt´s OK.
lt´s OK.

760
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:16,550
Caparzo...

761
00:52:16,630 --> 00:52:18,790
put that little girl back!

762
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:21,060
Caparzo,
get that kid back now!

763
00:52:21,130 --> 00:52:23,860
Upham, how do you say
"lt´s OK"?

764
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,060
I can´t. She reminds me
of my niece, sir.

765
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:28,070
Caparzo, get the kid
back up there!

766
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:29,730
Captain,
the decent thing to do

767
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,070
is to take her down the road
to the next town.

768
00:52:32,140 --> 00:52:33,570
We´re not here
to do the decent thing!

769
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:35,130
We´re here to follow
fuckin´ orders!

770
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,240
Sarge,
take this goddamn kid!

771
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,570
Cover!

772
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:41,380
Cover!

773
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,080
Oh!

774
00:52:46,150 --> 00:52:48,590
French Couple:
Jacqueline! Jacqueline!

775
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,090
- Come on.
- No!

776
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,130
Hill: Goddamn it!
Where´d that come from?

777
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:56,930
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

778
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:04,270
That´s where I´d be.

779
00:53:06,510 --> 00:53:07,940
I didn´t see it.

780
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:10,600
450 yards, Captain.
Maybe a shade under.

781
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:12,610
I wouldn´t venture out there,
fellas!

782
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:14,840
This sniper´s got talent!

783
00:53:14,950 --> 00:53:16,040
Jacqueline!

784
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,050
Mama!

785
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:20,720
Please don´t cry.

786
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,920
I´m gonna take you back
to your mama and papa.

787
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:24,930
Please don´t cry.
Come on.

788
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,690
Carpy.

789
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:41,730
Captain.

790
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:44,110
Hold on, Caparzo.

791
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,270
Help me up.

792
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,040
I can walk.
I can walk.

793
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:48,780
Caparzo, stay still!

794
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,120
All right.

795
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:03,120
2 clicks, left wind.

796
00:54:06,530 --> 00:54:08,470
Fish!

797
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,630
Cherie, il faut
surtout pas bouger!

798
00:54:15,540 --> 00:54:18,640
Captain, can you see him
from there? How is he?

799
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,910
Wade, you stay put.

800
00:54:21,020 --> 00:54:22,310
Where´s he shot, Captain?

801
00:54:24,850 --> 00:54:26,380
Captain, can you
see him from there?

802
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:27,390
You stay there!

803
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:29,950
Damn it, stay down!

804
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,490
What´s the matter with you?

805
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,760
Am I gonna take care of you
if you get hit? Huh?

806
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:36,800
Fish, come over here.

807
00:54:36,870 --> 00:54:38,800
Carpy,
put your head down.

808
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:40,600
Put your head down.

809
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,170
Go my God,
I trust in Thee.

810
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,180
Let me not be ashamed.

811
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,340
Let not my enemies
triumph over me.

812
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,520
Copy it.

813
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,790
Copy it
and send it for me.

814
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,530
Carpy, you´re gonna
send it yourself.

815
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:14,530
Put it down!

816
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,530
lt´s got blGood!

817
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:16,700
Carpy, I see it.

818
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,140
lt´s-- lt´s...

819
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:24,640
lt´s to my dad.

820
00:55:24,710 --> 00:55:26,200
lt´s got blGood on it.

821
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:55,870
We got him.

822
00:55:55,940 --> 00:55:56,970
Stay down.

823
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:57,980
Man:
Jacqueline!

824
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,910
Woman:
Jacqueline!

825
00:56:04,990 --> 00:56:06,920
Mellish:
How bad is it?

826
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,250
Chest, maybe lung shot.

827
00:56:25,540 --> 00:56:27,340
Get that 30
up the street!

828
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:33,980
Miller:
Detail!

829
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,520
Horvath:
Clear up!

830
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:36,980
Miller:
Clear down!

831
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,830
That´s why
we can´t take children.

832
00:57:00,610 --> 00:57:02,010
Sergeant Horvath,

833
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:04,010
do an ammo check.

834
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,550
Upham...

835
00:57:05,610 --> 00:57:06,840
canteens.

836
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,140
Fill ´em up.

837
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,380
Sergeant Hill.

838
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:10,540
Hill: Yes, sir.

839
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:11,850
Miller:
ather your men.

840
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,220
We´ll form up

841
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:15,020
at the northwest corner
of the square.

842
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:16,020
Jackson!

843
00:57:16,090 --> 00:57:17,020
Jackson:
Sir!

844
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:18,560
Miller:
Mellish, check the tower,

845
00:57:18,630 --> 00:57:20,030
hustle back here.

846
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:21,560
Right now. Go!

847
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:34,740
Fuck Ryan.

848
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:46,580
Thunder!

849
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:48,050
Flash!

850
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,590
Come on in.

851
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,730
Hey, guys, we´re looking
for Captain Hamill.

852
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,600
Somewhere down there,
across the square.

853
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,070
Across the square.

854
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,600
Soldier: Go easy.
Watch for snipers.

855
00:58:02,670 --> 00:58:04,600
Take it easy.
Sit down.

856
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:22,920
All right. Jimmy T.,
go find Captain Hamill,

857
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:24,460
bring him in here.

858
00:58:24,530 --> 00:58:25,620
What? Up there?

859
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:26,920
How the hell
should I know?

860
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,620
Would you just go look,
please?

861
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,920
Thank you, you moron.

862
00:58:31,830 --> 00:58:33,460
All right.

863
00:58:33,530 --> 00:58:35,090
You guys just...

864
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,300
flake out here
for a while.

865
00:58:37,370 --> 00:58:38,770
Ohh.

866
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:41,500
Let me get this goddamn
hitchhiker out of my boot.

867
00:58:50,050 --> 00:58:51,380
Jesus!

868
00:58:52,450 --> 00:58:53,720
Drop your weapons!

869
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,880
Drop ´em now!

870
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:56,420
Drop the fucking weapons!

871
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,160
I´ll shoot you!

872
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,160
I´ll shoot you!

873
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,750
Drop! Drop! Drop ´em!

874
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,670
Now! Put ´em down!

875
00:59:23,990 --> 00:59:25,450
Clear up!

876
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,620
Shit.

877
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:33,090
Shit!

878
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:34,630
Hamill: Clear up!

879
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,300
Clear down!

880
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:51,540
Enough to make you old.

881
00:59:52,710 --> 00:59:54,010
Let´s hope so.

882
01:00:03,930 --> 01:00:05,480
Fred Hamill,
Pathfinders 101st.

883
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,490
John Miller,
2nd Rangers.

884
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:09,220
Thank you.

885
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:12,500
We´re here looking for
a Private James Ryan.

886
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,970
He´s part
of your outfit.

887
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,630
Any chance at all
you policed him up?

888
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:17,430
Hamill:
How was the road in?

889
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:18,900
Miller: Scenic.

890
01:00:18,970 --> 01:00:21,440
We lost
most of our ammo.

891
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,440
Horvath: Not to mention
one of our men.

892
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,070
Lieutenant,
redeploy that bazooka

893
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,740
to the right side
of the road.

894
01:00:26,810 --> 01:00:27,910
Lieutenant:
Yes, sir!

895
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,450
And get Ryan up here.

896
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:32,920
Lieutenant: Ryan!

897
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:35,460
Ryan, front and center!

898
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,010
Soldier: Ryan!

899
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:41,930
Here comes
our boy.

900
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,470
Told you
he was an asshole.

901
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,470
Sir, Private Ryan
reporting as ordered.

902
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:56,940
At ease.

903
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:58,480
Captain Miller,
2nd Rangers.

904
01:00:58,550 --> 01:00:59,950
He wants a word
with you.

905
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,280
This way.

906
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,940
All right.

907
01:01:06,020 --> 01:01:07,490
Take a knee.

908
01:01:16,630 --> 01:01:19,160
Private, I´m afraid I have
some bad news for you.

909
01:01:27,680 --> 01:01:29,910
Well, there isn´t
any real easy way

910
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,740
to say this, so, uh...

911
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:35,010
so I´ll just say it.

912
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:37,350
Your brothers are dead.

913
01:01:37,450 --> 01:01:43,190
We have, uh, orders
to come get you...

914
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,820
´cause you´re going home.

915
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,730
Oh, my God,
my brothers are dead.

916
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:11,810
I was gonna take ´em fishing
when we got home.

917
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:28,540
Hamill:
I´m so sorry, James.

918
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:31,130
I can´t tell you how much.

919
01:02:31,210 --> 01:02:34,040
How-- How did
they die?

920
01:02:34,110 --> 01:02:36,980
They were killed
in action.

921
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,170
No, that can´t be.
They´re both--

922
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:43,580
That... That can´t be.

923
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:47,310
My brothers are still
in grammar school.

924
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:50,950
You´re James Ryan?

925
01:02:51,030 --> 01:02:52,720
Yeah.

926
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:56,020
James Francis Ryan
from lowa?

927
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,930
James Frederick Ryan,
Minnesota.

928
01:03:04,710 --> 01:03:07,940
Well, does that-- does that
mean my brothers are OK?

929
01:03:08,010 --> 01:03:09,940
Yeah, I´m sure
they´re fine.

930
01:03:10,010 --> 01:03:11,980
Are you sure that
they´re OK though?

931
01:03:12,050 --> 01:03:13,340
We´re looking for
a different Private Ryan.

932
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:14,940
This is just a big foul-up.

933
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:17,450
How do you know?
How can you be sure?

934
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:19,110
How do you know
the foul-up

935
01:03:19,190 --> 01:03:21,810
isn´t that his brothers
are OK and that--

936
01:03:21,890 --> 01:03:22,820
Lieutenant.

937
01:03:22,890 --> 01:03:24,080
I´m sorry
for the trouble.

938
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:26,720
I just wrote them a letter
before I left.

939
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,990
I got to get home.

940
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,330
I got to get home
right now.

941
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,800
I want to go home.

942
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:34,460
Lieutenant:
Shh, take it easy.

943
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:35,830
So where in the hell
is our Ryan?

944
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:36,840
I don´t know.

945
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,740
Are you in touch
with your C.O.?

946
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:39,740
That figures.

947
01:03:39,770 --> 01:03:41,370
What unit´s
your Ryan in?

948
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:43,030
Baker Company,
5-0-6.

949
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:44,940
The guy with the broken
foot, he´s 5-0-6, right?

950
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:46,270
Yeah. Charlie,
I think.

951
01:03:46,350 --> 01:03:47,610
- You think?
- Yeah.

952
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:50,410
Ryan? Don´t know-- Man!

953
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:52,780
Miller: Where was
your drop zone?

954
01:03:52,850 --> 01:03:54,220
Just inside of Vierville.

955
01:03:54,290 --> 01:03:55,350
Vierville?

956
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:57,150
How the hell did you
end up way up here?

957
01:03:57,220 --> 01:03:58,490
You got me, sir.

958
01:03:58,590 --> 01:04:00,490
C-47 took heavy fire.

959
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,220
Pilot went crazy trying
to get out of there,

960
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,590
turning every which way,

961
01:04:03,660 --> 01:04:06,000
took more fire in the drop,
got messy.

962
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:07,470
I ended up here.

963
01:04:07,570 --> 01:04:09,630
I haven´t seen a single guy
from my stick, sir.

964
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,000
God knows
where they are.

965
01:04:11,070 --> 01:04:12,770
Anybody from Baker Company
have a big mouth?

966
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:14,740
Say where the drop zone
might´ve been?

967
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,640
No, sir,
but I know Baker Company

968
01:04:16,710 --> 01:04:18,270
had the same rally point
as us.

969
01:04:18,350 --> 01:04:20,310
Show me.

970
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,850
My men are beat.

971
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,850
We´re gonna hold up here
for about 3 hours.

972
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,080
We´ll pull out after dark.

973
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,090
ot anything left
in this town

974
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,590
like a 3-star hotel,
something with clean sheets

975
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:33,020
and soft pillows
and room service?

976
01:04:33,090 --> 01:04:35,030
How about
a nice comfy church?

977
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:36,030
We´ll take that.

978
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:37,360
What have you heard?

979
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:39,020
How´s it all
falling together?

980
01:04:39,100 --> 01:04:41,000
Well, we got
the beachhead secure.

981
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:43,830
Problem is Monty´s taking
his time moving on Caen.

982
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,400
We can´t pull out
till he´s ready. So--

983
01:04:46,470 --> 01:04:47,810
That guy´s overrated.

984
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:48,970
No argument here.

985
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,810
You got to take Caen,
so you can take Saint-Lo.

986
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,780
You got to take Saint-Lo
to take Valognes.

987
01:04:53,850 --> 01:04:55,410
Valognes,
you got Cherbourg.

988
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,040
And Cherbourg,
you got Paris.

989
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:59,350
Paris, you get Berlin.

990
01:04:59,420 --> 01:05:01,410
And then
that big boat home.

991
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:06,720
We sure as hell could
use you around here,

992
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,730
but I understand
what you´re doing.

993
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:09,860
You do?

994
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:13,060
Yeah. I got a couple
of brothers myself.

995
01:05:13,130 --> 01:05:14,100
Oh.

996
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:15,640
Good luck.

997
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:16,800
Thank you.

998
01:05:16,870 --> 01:05:18,400
No, I mean it.

999
01:05:18,470 --> 01:05:21,070
Find him.
Get him home.

1000
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:31,580
Horvath:
What´s with your hand?

1001
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:33,950
I don´t know.

1002
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,850
lt started in Portsmouth

1003
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:39,450
when they brought us
down for embarkation.

1004
01:05:39,530 --> 01:05:40,960
lt comes and goes.

1005
01:05:41,030 --> 01:05:44,160
Well, you may have to get
yourself a new line of work.

1006
01:05:44,230 --> 01:05:47,170
This one doesn´t seem
to agree with you anymore.

1007
01:05:52,670 --> 01:05:53,900
What?

1008
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:58,950
What?

1009
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:00,000
Nothing.

1010
01:06:00,080 --> 01:06:03,020
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

1011
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,710
The one that was always

1012
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:06,280
walking around
on his hands, you know,

1013
01:06:06,350 --> 01:06:08,320
and he was
singing that song

1014
01:06:08,390 --> 01:06:10,050
about the man
on the flying trapeze?

1015
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:11,110
Vecchio.

1016
01:06:11,190 --> 01:06:12,720
Vecchio.

1017
01:06:16,130 --> 01:06:18,190
Yeah.

1018
01:06:18,270 --> 01:06:19,730
Yeah, Vecchio.

1019
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,200
He was a goofy kid.

1020
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:26,400
I remember he used to pee
a "V" on everybody´s jacket

1021
01:06:26,470 --> 01:06:28,700
for Vecchio.

1022
01:06:28,740 --> 01:06:30,040
For victory.

1023
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,340
Vecchio.

1024
01:06:34,250 --> 01:06:35,720
He was so short.

1025
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:37,720
He was a midget,
wasn´t he?

1026
01:06:37,790 --> 01:06:39,650
"How did you
get to be a ranger?"

1027
01:06:41,090 --> 01:06:43,320
He got shot in the foot once,
didn´t he?

1028
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:44,820
And he was walking
on his hands.

1029
01:06:44,890 --> 01:06:47,090
Yeah, well, he could
walk faster on his hands.

1030
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:51,690
He could run faster
on his hands than...

1031
01:06:54,800 --> 01:06:57,030
Vecchio.

1032
01:06:57,100 --> 01:06:58,540
Yeah.

1033
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,540
Caparzo.

1034
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:08,840
You see, when...

1035
01:07:11,020 --> 01:07:14,010
when you end up killing
one of your men, you see,

1036
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:17,180
you tell yourself
it happened

1037
01:07:17,260 --> 01:07:21,350
so you could save
the lives of 2 or 3

1038
01:07:21,430 --> 01:07:24,360
or 10 others.

1039
01:07:24,430 --> 01:07:26,520
Maybe a hundred others.

1040
01:07:30,570 --> 01:07:33,800
Do you know how many men
I´ve lost under my command?

1041
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:34,810
How many?

1042
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,140
4.

1043
01:07:37,210 --> 01:07:40,910
But that means
I´ve saved the lives

1044
01:07:40,980 --> 01:07:43,210
of 10 times that many,
doesn´t it?

1045
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:46,280
Maybe even 20, right?

1046
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:47,790
20 times as many?

1047
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,790
And that´s
how simple it is.

1048
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,060
That´s how you...

1049
01:07:59,130 --> 01:08:00,330
That´s how you

1050
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,270
rationalize
making the choice

1051
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:05,460
between the mission
and the men.

1052
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:08,470
Except this time,
this mission is a man.

1053
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,250
This Ryan
better be worth it.

1054
01:08:17,320 --> 01:08:20,250
He´d better go home
and cure some disease

1055
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:24,450
or invent a longer-lasting
lightbulb or something.

1056
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:26,320
´Cause the truth is,
I wouldn´t trade 10 Ryans

1057
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,230
for one Vecchio
or one Caparzo.

1058
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,260
Amen.

1059
01:08:32,370 --> 01:08:35,390
Look.
There it goes again.

1060
01:08:35,470 --> 01:08:36,900
Sir...

1061
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:39,940
are you all right?

1062
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:47,280
Now, look, we´re gonna
move out in 2 hours.

1063
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:49,210
Why don´t you
get some sleep?

1064
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,010
Reiben: I don´t know
how he does it.

1065
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:53,180
Mellish: What´s that?

1066
01:08:53,250 --> 01:08:54,520
Falls asleep like that.

1067
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,920
I mean, look at him.

1068
01:08:55,990 --> 01:08:59,080
The guy´s lights out the minute
his head hits the pack.

1069
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,490
Clear conscience.

1070
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,160
Yeah, what´s that saying?
"lf God´s on our side,

1071
01:09:03,230 --> 01:09:05,160
who the hell could
be on theirs?"

1072
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:08,430
"lf God be for us,
who could be against us?"

1073
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:09,990
Yeah, what did I say?

1074
01:09:10,070 --> 01:09:11,230
Wade: Well, actually,

1075
01:09:11,310 --> 01:09:15,000
the trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

1076
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,980
Mellish:
How is that, Wade?

1077
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:18,810
Wade: Well, when my
mother was an intern,

1078
01:09:18,910 --> 01:09:22,080
she used to work late
through the night,

1079
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:23,670
sleep through the day.

1080
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,120
So the only time

1081
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:26,410
that we ever got
to talk about anything

1082
01:09:26,490 --> 01:09:27,980
was when she´d get home.

1083
01:09:28,060 --> 01:09:30,650
So what I used to do,
I used to lie in my bed

1084
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:32,090
and try to stay awake
as long as I could,

1085
01:09:32,160 --> 01:09:36,100
but it never worked
´cause the harder I tried,

1086
01:09:36,160 --> 01:09:37,990
the faster
I´d fall asleep.

1087
01:09:38,070 --> 01:09:41,330
Yeah, well, that wouldn´t have
mattered none in my house.

1088
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:43,730
My ma, she would´ve come home,
shook me awake,

1089
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:46,360
chatted me up till dawn.

1090
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:48,640
I swear, that woman
was never too tired to talk.

1091
01:09:48,710 --> 01:09:50,640
Yeah, that´s probably
the only time

1092
01:09:50,710 --> 01:09:53,580
she could get a word in.

1093
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,080
Funny thing is,

1094
01:09:57,150 --> 01:10:00,250
sometimes she´d
come home early,

1095
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,790
and I´d pretend
to be asleep.

1096
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:05,690
Mellish: Who?
Your-- Your mom?

1097
01:10:05,730 --> 01:10:06,820
Yeah.

1098
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,460
She´d stand in the doorway
looking at me.

1099
01:10:12,970 --> 01:10:15,560
And I would just
keep my eyes shut.

1100
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:21,870
And I knew she just wanted
to find out about my day,

1101
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:23,740
that she came home early...

1102
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:28,810
just to talk to me.

1103
01:10:30,650 --> 01:10:32,240
And I still wouldn´t move.

1104
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,840
I´d still pretend
to just be asleep.

1105
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,760
I don´t know why I did that.

1106
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,680
Miller:
We only got a couple hours.

1107
01:10:59,710 --> 01:11:01,680
Shut up and go to sleep.

1108
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:12,420
Captain?

1109
01:11:12,490 --> 01:11:14,220
Upham: Sir?

1110
01:11:15,730 --> 01:11:17,090
Corporal?

1111
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:24,740
How you doin´ there?
You all right?

1112
01:11:24,810 --> 01:11:29,940
Yeah, I think this is
all good for me, sir.

1113
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:32,340
Really?

1114
01:11:32,410 --> 01:11:33,570
How is that?

1115
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:40,310
"War educates
the senses,

1116
01:11:40,390 --> 01:11:42,380
calls into action
the will,

1117
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:45,550
perfects the physical
constitution,

1118
01:11:45,630 --> 01:11:48,560
brings men into such
swift and close collision

1119
01:11:48,630 --> 01:11:52,070
in critical moments
that man measures man."

1120
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:55,400
Yeah, well, I guess
that´s Emerson´s way of...

1121
01:11:55,470 --> 01:11:56,940
finding the bright side.

1122
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,530
You know Emerson, sir?

1123
01:11:59,610 --> 01:12:01,270
I know some.

1124
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:07,510
So where are you from,
Captain?

1125
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,670
What´d you do
before the war?

1126
01:12:11,220 --> 01:12:13,190
What´s the pool up to?

1127
01:12:16,990 --> 01:12:20,760
You know, I think
it´s around 300, sir.

1128
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:23,230
Well,
when it gets up to 500,

1129
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,700
I´ll give you the answers
and we´ll split the money.

1130
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:27,700
How about that?

1131
01:12:27,730 --> 01:12:29,500
Well, if that´s
the way you feel, sir,

1132
01:12:29,570 --> 01:12:31,560
I feel it´s my duty
under your command

1133
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:32,940
to sugest that we wait

1134
01:12:33,010 --> 01:12:35,630
until it gets up
to a thousand, sir.

1135
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:39,840
What if we don´t
live that long?

1136
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:43,670
500?

1137
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:46,240
500 would be good,
yeah.

1138
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,290
Yes, sir.

1139
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:48,650
Yeah.

1140
01:12:50,920 --> 01:12:52,590
Get some sleep,
Corporal.

1141
01:12:52,660 --> 01:12:53,790
Yes, sir.

1142
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:01,720
Soldier:
Who´s got sulfa powder?

1143
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:07,290
Soldier: Medic!
My buddy´s bleeding!

1144
01:14:07,370 --> 01:14:08,770
He needs a tourniquet!

1145
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:09,770
Wade.

1146
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:10,860
Wade: Yes, sir?

1147
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:12,300
See what you can do.

1148
01:14:12,370 --> 01:14:13,300
Yes, sir.

1149
01:14:13,370 --> 01:14:14,470
Hold on, fellas.

1150
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:15,970
lt won´t be
much longer.

1151
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:17,510
How we doing here?

1152
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:20,080
All right.

1153
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,650
Yeah, doing all right.
Don´t worry about it.

1154
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,680
Doc´s in town.

1155
01:14:24,720 --> 01:14:26,050
Jackson: lt´s all right.
lt´s all right.

1156
01:14:26,120 --> 01:14:27,590
Don´t worry, fellas.

1157
01:14:27,650 --> 01:14:28,850
The 2th lnfantry´s
breaking through.

1158
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,050
They´ll be here soon.

1159
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:32,610
Soldier: Plasma.
Anybody got plasma?

1160
01:14:32,690 --> 01:14:34,720
Captain.
Hey, Captain.

1161
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,460
Soldier,
you want to fill me in?

1162
01:14:36,530 --> 01:14:38,500
Uh, yeah.
Lieutenant Dewindt, sir.

1163
01:14:38,570 --> 01:14:39,790
th Troop Carrier Squadron

1164
01:14:39,870 --> 01:14:42,430
carrying in
327th lider lnfantry.

1165
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:43,900
This one was mine, sir.

1166
01:14:43,970 --> 01:14:45,340
I was the pilot.

1167
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:46,390
22 men dead.

1168
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:48,410
I ended up over there
without a scratch.

1169
01:14:48,480 --> 01:14:49,740
lt took my copilot´s head
right off.

1170
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:51,710
Well, where´s the unit?
Who are these people?

1171
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:53,650
Well, the guys
we came in with, sir,

1172
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:56,080
they headed off first night.
Haven´t seen them since.

1173
01:14:56,150 --> 01:14:58,380
Meantime, other guys
keep showing up,

1174
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,220
1, 2, half-dozen
at a time.

1175
01:15:00,290 --> 01:15:03,260
Then some officer´ll come along
and patch together a mixed unit,

1176
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:05,720
head off to make trouble, sir.

1177
01:15:05,790 --> 01:15:07,730
We´re looking for
a Private James Ryan.

1178
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:10,060
He was in Baker Company
5-0-6 of the 101st.

1179
01:15:10,130 --> 01:15:11,390
No, you got me, sir.

1180
01:15:11,470 --> 01:15:12,800
A lot of guys
come in and out of here.

1181
01:15:12,870 --> 01:15:13,990
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1182
01:15:14,070 --> 01:15:17,000
Check out that squad.
See if Ryan´s in it.

1183
01:15:17,070 --> 01:15:18,900
Yes, sir.

1184
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,060
Reiben.

1185
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,370
Smell that leg
right there.

1186
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,500
Find out if it´s
south of cheese.

1187
01:15:30,850 --> 01:15:31,910
Wade: What?

1188
01:15:33,550 --> 01:15:34,780
Juden.

1189
01:15:36,620 --> 01:15:37,560
Juden.

1190
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,960
Soldier: Keep moving.
Keep moving!

1191
01:15:40,030 --> 01:15:41,620
Juden.

1192
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:43,960
I´m Juden,
you know?

1193
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:46,330
Ju-den.

1194
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:47,960
Yeah, I couldn´t
pry him out of there

1195
01:15:48,040 --> 01:15:49,500
hard as I tried.

1196
01:15:49,570 --> 01:15:50,800
I´d need a winch.

1197
01:15:50,870 --> 01:15:51,860
Horvath: Yeah.

1198
01:15:55,380 --> 01:15:56,400
Horvath: Stars.

1199
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,710
Yep,
Brigadier General Amend,

1200
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:02,440
deputy commander, 101st.

1201
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:05,010
Some fucking genius
had the great idea

1202
01:16:05,090 --> 01:16:06,550
of welding a couple
of steel plates

1203
01:16:06,620 --> 01:16:08,590
onto our deck to keep
the general safe

1204
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:10,020
from ground fire.

1205
01:16:10,090 --> 01:16:11,790
Unfortunately, they forgot
to tell me about it

1206
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,020
until we were just
getting airborne.

1207
01:16:14,090 --> 01:16:16,120
Well, that´s like trying
to fly a freight train.

1208
01:16:16,200 --> 01:16:17,490
OK?

1209
01:16:17,560 --> 01:16:18,790
ross overload.

1210
01:16:18,870 --> 01:16:21,660
Trim characteristics
all shot to hell.

1211
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,730
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

1212
01:16:24,770 --> 01:16:26,970
And when--
And when we released,

1213
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:29,200
you know, I cut
as hard as I could,

1214
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:30,800
tried to gain
some altitude

1215
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:32,810
and still keep her
from stalling.

1216
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:34,870
We came down
like a fucking meteor.

1217
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:37,780
And this is how
we ended up.

1218
01:16:37,850 --> 01:16:39,910
And the others,

1219
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:42,650
they stopped easy enough
OK, though, you know?

1220
01:16:42,720 --> 01:16:45,450
We were just--
We were just too damn heavy,

1221
01:16:45,530 --> 01:16:46,690
you know?

1222
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,990
The grass was wet.

1223
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:51,530
Downward slope and all.

1224
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:54,360
22 guys dead.

1225
01:16:56,470 --> 01:16:58,370
All that for a general?

1226
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,600
One man.

1227
01:17:02,340 --> 01:17:03,930
Lot of that going around.

1228
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,600
FUBAR.

1229
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:07,010
FUBAR.

1230
01:17:07,080 --> 01:17:08,480
FUBAR.

1231
01:17:08,550 --> 01:17:09,850
FUBAR.

1232
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,040
Y´all got that right.

1233
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,780
I looked up "FUBAR" in
the German dictionary.

1234
01:17:14,860 --> 01:17:16,480
There´s no "FUBAR"
in there.

1235
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,580
- Upham.
- Yes, sir?

1236
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,120
There´s more paratroops
out there.

1237
01:17:19,190 --> 01:17:20,320
Find out
if one of them´s Ryan.

1238
01:17:20,430 --> 01:17:21,450
Yes, sir.

1239
01:17:21,530 --> 01:17:24,590
Oh, you might want to
check these out, sir.

1240
01:17:24,660 --> 01:17:26,430
Dog tags.

1241
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:29,060
More than I really
want to count, sir.

1242
01:17:30,200 --> 01:17:33,200
I´ve-- I´ve covered
a lot of bodies, sir.

1243
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:35,330
Miller: Jackson...

1244
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,970
start going
through those.

1245
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,100
Yes, sir.

1246
01:17:39,550 --> 01:17:41,450
I´ll help.

1247
01:17:42,920 --> 01:17:44,540
What do you think,
Jackson?

1248
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,780
Do you think that
little prick´s in there?

1249
01:17:45,850 --> 01:17:47,790
Well, if he is,
I´m gonna find him.

1250
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,150
I bet that
son of a bitch is.

1251
01:17:49,220 --> 01:17:50,780
Reiben: I got big money saying
this guy´s still alive.

1252
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:53,090
Mellish: 10 bucks
says I nail him first.

1253
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,680
Let´s see
who we got in here.

1254
01:17:54,730 --> 01:17:56,060
You mugs don´t
stand a chance.

1255
01:17:56,130 --> 01:17:57,860
All right, you think this little
shit bird´s in here or what?

1256
01:17:57,930 --> 01:17:59,730
Just keep looking.

1257
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:02,230
All right.
ary lanico.

1258
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:03,700
Ben Rubino.
Mike Cessacchio.

1259
01:18:03,740 --> 01:18:05,930
I swear, all the guineas
are buying it, huh?

1260
01:18:06,010 --> 01:18:08,340
Mellish: Oh, come on,
not the right name.

1261
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,640
Wee Willie Winkie,
that´s a buddy of yours.

1262
01:18:10,710 --> 01:18:12,870
Reiben:
We gotta find this prick.

1263
01:18:17,180 --> 01:18:19,550
Where is
this son of a bitch?

1264
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:21,250
Don´t mix them up,
Jackson, all right?

1265
01:18:21,320 --> 01:18:22,290
Keep them in your
own fucking pile.

1266
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:24,720
How am I supposed
to know who we got?

1267
01:18:24,790 --> 01:18:27,620
Why don´t you just shut up,
Reiben, all right?

1268
01:18:27,690 --> 01:18:28,920
Mellish:
Everybody be friends.

1269
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,660
Reiben:
Cranky there, huh?

1270
01:18:32,030 --> 01:18:33,330
I think
I got a winner.

1271
01:18:33,430 --> 01:18:34,900
What are you
talking about?

1272
01:18:34,970 --> 01:18:36,460
Ryan.

1273
01:18:36,540 --> 01:18:37,560
Ryan?

1274
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,540
Take a look at that,
Mellish.

1275
01:18:39,610 --> 01:18:41,200
You know what? You´re a genius.
You really are.

1276
01:18:41,270 --> 01:18:43,110
R-I-E-N-N-E.

1277
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:45,110
That´s Rienne.
And that´s French, all right?

1278
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:46,670
You know what that means?

1279
01:18:46,710 --> 01:18:47,980
Jackson:
lt´s means nothing.

1280
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:49,480
Mellish:
What beats 3 of a kind?

1281
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:50,880
Jackson:
I got shit here.

1282
01:18:50,950 --> 01:18:52,480
I got all guys
from New York.

1283
01:18:52,550 --> 01:18:53,950
Reiben: Do you need
a hand with that?

1284
01:18:54,020 --> 01:18:55,490
Mellish: Ah,
I got a full house.

1285
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:57,580
Reiben: ot you beat.
Straight flush.

1286
01:18:57,660 --> 01:18:59,630
You were looking
at my tags.

1287
01:18:59,690 --> 01:19:00,960
You´re cheating.
You know?

1288
01:19:01,030 --> 01:19:02,120
Ryan.

1289
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:03,860
Reiben: Fuckin´ unreal,
this guy.

1290
01:19:03,930 --> 01:19:05,330
Do you need a hand
with that?

1291
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:06,700
Can you read that shit?

1292
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:09,130
Jesus Christ, look at
this poor bastard, huh?

1293
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,030
Mellish: I guess they´re
not bulletproof, huh?

1294
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,330
Reiben: uess not.
All right?

1295
01:19:12,410 --> 01:19:13,900
Mellish: I don´t like what
he´s got between his ears.

1296
01:19:13,970 --> 01:19:16,200
Jackson: Sort of
what you fellas got

1297
01:19:16,280 --> 01:19:17,540
between your legs.

1298
01:19:17,610 --> 01:19:20,010
Mellish:
We got to give him that.

1299
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:21,210
Not bad for you,
Jackson.

1300
01:19:21,280 --> 01:19:22,770
I got 3 of a kind.

1301
01:19:22,850 --> 01:19:23,940
Full house.

1302
01:19:24,020 --> 01:19:26,350
The whole goddamn
airborne´s watching.

1303
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,720
These aren´t poker chips.

1304
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,020
Mellish:
All right, all right.

1305
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:31,020
Wade:
Put ´em back in there!

1306
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:56,980
He´s not here.

1307
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:01,020
Wade: Put ´em back.

1308
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:02,380
Maybe we should bust up

1309
01:20:02,460 --> 01:20:03,950
into a couple of
different groups, huh?

1310
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,550
And wander the wGoods
like Hansel and retel,

1311
01:20:05,630 --> 01:20:06,650
calling his name.

1312
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:08,320
He´s bound to hear us
sooner or later.

1313
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,860
Ryan!

1314
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:13,130
That might be a little
hard to do, Captain.

1315
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:14,720
Maybe the locals
have seen him.

1316
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:16,360
Hey, you know--
uh, excusez-moi.

1317
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:18,400
Parlez-vous Ryan,
James ryan?

1318
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:20,130
Merci. Merci beaucoup.

1319
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:22,200
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne?

1320
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:24,570
Ryan? You know
a guy named Ryan?

1321
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:26,370
Private James Ryan
from lowa?

1322
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,180
Anybody know a Ryan?

1323
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:30,340
James Ryan?!

1324
01:20:30,420 --> 01:20:32,980
Hey, Joe,

1325
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:34,680
doesn´t, uh, Michaelson

1326
01:20:34,720 --> 01:20:37,280
pal around with a Ryan
from "C" Company?

1327
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,590
Yeah, I think so.

1328
01:20:38,660 --> 01:20:40,720
Well, bring him
up here, would you?

1329
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:51,000
You know
Private Ryan?

1330
01:20:51,070 --> 01:20:52,470
You´re gonna have
to speak up, sir.

1331
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:53,830
You´re gonna have
to speak up, sir!

1332
01:20:53,910 --> 01:20:55,600
My hearing
is not so good!

1333
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:56,730
lt comes and goes!

1334
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:58,840
A German grenade went off
right by my head!

1335
01:20:58,910 --> 01:21:00,000
ot it, got it.

1336
01:21:00,080 --> 01:21:02,050
Do you know
Private Ryan?

1337
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,580
Who?

1338
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,980
Private Ryan?
James Ryan?

1339
01:21:06,050 --> 01:21:07,310
Jimmy Ryan?

1340
01:21:07,390 --> 01:21:10,380
James.
James Francis Ryan.

1341
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,290
No, no, no.
James Francis Ryan.

1342
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:16,350
Get me a pencil.
Something to write on.

1343
01:21:16,430 --> 01:21:18,420
Quick! Quick!
Come on, a pencil!

1344
01:21:20,670 --> 01:21:22,530
Here you are.
A small one, sir.

1345
01:21:22,640 --> 01:21:24,600
Write this down.

1346
01:21:24,670 --> 01:21:26,640
James Francis Ryan,
Question mark.

1347
01:21:26,710 --> 01:21:28,900
lowa, question mark.

1348
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:31,070
Do you know him?
Does he know him?

1349
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:32,410
Read the message. Look.

1350
01:21:35,050 --> 01:21:37,140
Yeah. Of course
I know him, sir.

1351
01:21:37,220 --> 01:21:38,810
Does he know
where he is?

1352
01:21:42,190 --> 01:21:43,680
Yeah, yeah.

1353
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:46,250
We missed our drop zone
by about 20 miles,

1354
01:21:46,330 --> 01:21:49,660
ended up way over by
Bumville or some damn place.

1355
01:21:49,730 --> 01:21:51,030
Him, me, and a couple
of other guys

1356
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:52,790
were coming here
to the rally point,

1357
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:55,490
ran into a colonel
who was gathering up men

1358
01:21:55,570 --> 01:21:58,730
to go to, uh... Ramelle...

1359
01:21:58,770 --> 01:21:59,740
Ramelle.

1360
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:00,970
To baby-sit a bridge.

1361
01:22:01,040 --> 01:22:02,300
That´s the last
I´ve seen of him, sir.

1362
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:04,140
Great! Great!
Thank-- Thank you.

1363
01:22:04,210 --> 01:22:06,240
Write thank you.
Read and thank you.

1364
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:07,540
Michaelson:
You´re welcome!

1365
01:22:07,650 --> 01:22:08,880
Assemble on me.

1366
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:12,710
Thank you, Lieutenant.

1367
01:22:15,820 --> 01:22:18,020
Ramelle.

1368
01:22:18,090 --> 01:22:21,420
We´re here. There.

1369
01:22:21,490 --> 01:22:22,720
Ramelle...

1370
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:24,730
is on the Merderet River
right here,

1371
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:26,730
just to the southwest
of us.

1372
01:22:26,770 --> 01:22:28,730
You know anything
about this bridge

1373
01:22:28,770 --> 01:22:30,360
he was talking
about, Captain?

1374
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:33,900
Yep. The target has
always been Cherbourg.

1375
01:22:33,970 --> 01:22:37,430
We can´t push on Paris until
we take a deep water port,

1376
01:22:37,510 --> 01:22:39,310
and Rommel knows that.

1377
01:22:39,380 --> 01:22:40,680
So he´s gonna try
to get his armor

1378
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,880
across the Merderet River
anywhere he can.

1379
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:46,580
That way, he can hit
our invasion forces in the flank

1380
01:22:46,690 --> 01:22:48,920
when we make the big
right turn to Cherbourg.

1381
01:22:48,990 --> 01:22:51,050
That makes any village
on that river

1382
01:22:51,120 --> 01:22:53,890
with an intact bridge
solid gold real estate.

1383
01:23:14,150 --> 01:23:16,170
Let´s go.

1384
01:23:25,060 --> 01:23:25,500
Wade: Captain.

1385
01:24:04,580 --> 01:24:06,450
Horvath:
What the hell is that?

1386
01:24:08,330 --> 01:24:09,930
Miller: A radar site.

1387
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:11,700
lt´s got to be
out of action.

1388
01:24:11,770 --> 01:24:13,830
Well, it looks like we
got something in that...

1389
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:16,470
sandbag bunker
right under the station.

1390
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:18,570
See it?

1391
01:24:18,610 --> 01:24:20,510
Yeah.
That´s my guess, too.

1392
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,380
What is it?

1393
01:24:24,450 --> 01:24:26,850
Machine gun.
Probably M-42.

1394
01:24:26,920 --> 01:24:29,180
Jesus. ls that
what got those guys?

1395
01:24:29,260 --> 01:24:31,220
Maybe one of them´s
our boy.

1396
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:32,950
Miller: No, their
patches are 82nd,

1397
01:24:33,030 --> 01:24:34,360
so your luck´s
not that good.

1398
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:36,920
I don´t know how fast
the rest of you Betties are,

1399
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:39,400
but I´m thinking we detour
this way quick and quiet,

1400
01:24:39,470 --> 01:24:41,200
the krauts will never
even know we were here.

1401
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:44,030
So, Captain, what I´m
trying to say is,

1402
01:24:44,100 --> 01:24:46,230
why don´t we just
go around the thing?

1403
01:24:46,310 --> 01:24:48,100
I hear what
you´re saying,

1404
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,110
but we can´t
go around it.

1405
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:53,240
I´m with Reiben
on this one, sir.

1406
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:55,250
I mean,
we left them 88s.

1407
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:56,580
For the air force.

1408
01:24:56,620 --> 01:24:59,050
The air force isn´t
gonna spend ordinance

1409
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:01,140
on one machine gun.

1410
01:25:01,220 --> 01:25:03,420
Mellish: Uh, Captain.

1411
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:06,430
We can still skip it and
accomplish our mission.

1412
01:25:06,490 --> 01:25:09,120
I mean, this isn´t
our mission, right, sir?

1413
01:25:09,200 --> 01:25:11,390
Oh, that´s what you
want to do, Mellish?

1414
01:25:11,460 --> 01:25:12,620
You just want
to leave it here

1415
01:25:12,730 --> 01:25:14,830
so they can ambush the next
company that comes along?

1416
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:16,870
No, sir, that´s not
what I´m saying.

1417
01:25:16,940 --> 01:25:19,530
I´m simply saying, it seems
like an unnecessary risk

1418
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:20,870
given our objective, sir.

1419
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:23,070
Our objective
is to win the war.

1420
01:25:26,050 --> 01:25:28,010
Sir, I just, uh,

1421
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:30,550
I don´t have a good feeling
about this one.

1422
01:25:32,050 --> 01:25:34,020
Well, when was
the last time

1423
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:35,680
you felt good
about anything?

1424
01:25:56,310 --> 01:26:00,510
All right, 3 runners
with suppressing fire.

1425
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:02,550
Mellish,
you hook to the right.

1426
01:26:02,620 --> 01:26:04,280
I´ll go up the middle.

1427
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:06,250
Who´s going left?

1428
01:26:12,330 --> 01:26:13,920
Who´s going left?

1429
01:26:18,430 --> 01:26:20,490
I´ll do it.

1430
01:26:20,570 --> 01:26:21,800
I´ll go left.

1431
01:26:21,870 --> 01:26:23,560
All right.

1432
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,130
Upham, switch off
with Jackson,

1433
01:26:25,210 --> 01:26:27,170
and you linger
in the rear.

1434
01:26:27,240 --> 01:26:28,730
Upham: Yes, sir.

1435
01:26:28,840 --> 01:26:30,040
We advance
and keep pressure on him

1436
01:26:30,110 --> 01:26:32,630
till he has to change out
his barrels.

1437
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:36,510
I think we should be able
to hit him from grenade range.

1438
01:26:36,580 --> 01:26:38,570
Maybe I should go up
the middle, sir.

1439
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:40,550
The way you run?
I don´t think so.

1440
01:26:40,620 --> 01:26:42,320
Maybe I should
go left, sir.

1441
01:26:42,390 --> 01:26:45,020
Maybe you
should shut up.

1442
01:26:45,090 --> 01:26:48,080
Reiben, base of fire.

1443
01:26:56,140 --> 01:26:58,930
Mags and clips where
you can reach ´em and...

1444
01:26:59,010 --> 01:27:01,970
and extra grenades
for the base runners.

1445
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:28,920
Horvath: Hill´s clear!
4 down and dead!

1446
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:32,260
Miller: Upham, grab the gear
and get up here!

1447
01:28:32,330 --> 01:28:34,390
We need water
and extra dressing now!

1448
01:28:34,470 --> 01:28:36,370
Get the morphine out of
the extra medical kit!

1449
01:28:36,440 --> 01:28:39,370
Get the morphine out of
the extra medical kit!

1450
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,450
Horvath:
Son of a bitch.

1451
01:28:51,520 --> 01:28:53,750
Miller:
Get some sulfa on there.

1452
01:28:53,820 --> 01:28:54,980
Wade: Move my legs up.
Move my legs up.

1453
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:56,020
More sulfa, Mellish.

1454
01:28:56,090 --> 01:28:57,020
Mellish:
Listen to my voice.

1455
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:59,250
You´re gonna be
all right, Doc.

1456
01:28:59,330 --> 01:29:00,720
Wade: How´s it look?

1457
01:29:00,790 --> 01:29:01,730
Wade, you´re fine.

1458
01:29:01,790 --> 01:29:02,990
You´re going
on a hospital ship.

1459
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:04,550
Miller: More sulfa!

1460
01:29:04,630 --> 01:29:07,160
Wade: Put my legs up,
put my legs up.

1461
01:29:07,230 --> 01:29:09,000
I got ´em, I got ´em,
I got ´em, I got ´em.

1462
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:10,900
Miller: You´re
gonna be OK, Wade.

1463
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,630
Upham,
give me your canteen!

1464
01:29:12,670 --> 01:29:14,160
Horvath: Come on.

1465
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,800
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1466
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:17,140
Horvath: Put some
pressure on it.

1467
01:29:17,210 --> 01:29:18,640
Miller:
You´re gonna be ok.

1468
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:19,840
Wade: How´s it look?

1469
01:29:19,910 --> 01:29:21,040
Miller: Give him
some morphine.

1470
01:29:21,110 --> 01:29:22,080
How´s it look?

1471
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:23,120
Miller:
lt´s all right.

1472
01:29:23,180 --> 01:29:24,110
How´s it look?

1473
01:29:24,180 --> 01:29:25,380
Horvath:
You´re gonna be OK.

1474
01:29:25,450 --> 01:29:27,610
Here comes
the morphine.

1475
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:30,710
Am I shot
in the spine?

1476
01:29:30,790 --> 01:29:32,380
Jackson:
You´re OK, Wade.

1477
01:29:32,460 --> 01:29:33,950
Am I shot
in the spine?

1478
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:36,360
Miller: Lift him up.
Easy, easy, easy.

1479
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:37,520
Horvath: Put some
pressure on him.

1480
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:38,890
Easy, easy.

1481
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:40,260
Horvath:
Lift him up.

1482
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:45,630
lt´s OK, Doc.
lt´s all right.

1483
01:29:45,710 --> 01:29:48,140
Wade, you got
an exit wound.

1484
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:49,900
lt´s in the small
of your back.

1485
01:29:50,010 --> 01:29:52,500
How big-- How big´s
the hole in the--

1486
01:29:52,580 --> 01:29:54,570
lt´s about the size
of an acorn.

1487
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:55,740
Mellish: You´re fine.
You´re fine.

1488
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,550
Horvath: Put some
pressure on it.

1489
01:30:00,620 --> 01:30:02,650
Put some pressure
on it.

1490
01:30:02,720 --> 01:30:04,350
Put some pressure
on it.

1491
01:30:04,420 --> 01:30:05,360
lt´s all right.

1492
01:30:05,430 --> 01:30:08,290
Horvath: Put some more
pressure on it!

1493
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,350
ls there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

1494
01:30:11,430 --> 01:30:13,370
Yeah, right here.
Do you know what it is?

1495
01:30:13,430 --> 01:30:14,660
No.

1496
01:30:14,730 --> 01:30:17,130
Right here. I´m gonna
put your hand on it.

1497
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:18,500
Jackson: We got some
pressure on her.

1498
01:30:18,570 --> 01:30:21,270
Right there. OK?
That´s the one.

1499
01:30:21,340 --> 01:30:25,500
Oh, my God, my liver!
Oh, my God, it´s my liver!

1500
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:28,950
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

1501
01:30:29,050 --> 01:30:31,780
What can we do?
Tell us what to do.

1502
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:33,610
Mellish: Oh, shit.

1503
01:30:33,650 --> 01:30:37,750
I could use-- I could use
a little more morphine.

1504
01:30:38,860 --> 01:30:40,990
More morphine, sir?

1505
01:30:41,090 --> 01:30:44,290
OK. OK.

1506
01:30:47,300 --> 01:30:48,960
Give it to him.

1507
01:30:51,200 --> 01:30:52,470
Give it to him.

1508
01:30:57,140 --> 01:30:58,110
I don´t wanna die.

1509
01:30:58,180 --> 01:30:59,470
Mellish:
Here you go. Wade.

1510
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:01,740
Here you go.
Here it comes. Shh.

1511
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:03,440
Jackson: There you go.
There you--

1512
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,690
Give him another one.

1513
01:31:15,830 --> 01:31:17,230
Mama?

1514
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:21,790
Mama?

1515
01:31:21,870 --> 01:31:25,630
I want to go home,
I want to go home.

1516
01:31:25,710 --> 01:31:29,400
Mama! Mama! Mam--

1517
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,600
Mama, Mama,

1518
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,740
Mama, Mama, Mam--

1519
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:10,350
Aah!

1520
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:16,580
Mellish:
Reiben, hold him!

1521
01:32:16,620 --> 01:32:17,590
Unh!

1522
01:32:30,370 --> 01:32:32,560
Bitte!
Totet mich nicht!

1523
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,940
lch will mich ergeben!

1524
01:32:34,010 --> 01:32:36,200
Vater unser im himmel,
geheiligt werde den name,

1525
01:32:36,280 --> 01:32:37,470
dein reich komme...

1526
01:32:37,540 --> 01:32:38,870
Not yet.

1527
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:44,670
First make him mark and cover
Wade´s body for grave detail.

1528
01:32:46,290 --> 01:32:49,740
Same thing for
those paratroopers down there.

1529
01:32:49,820 --> 01:32:51,620
Strip that stuff off him.
Check him for intelligence.

1530
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:54,890
Ask this piece of shit if
he´s the one who shot Wade.

1531
01:32:54,960 --> 01:32:55,890
Ask him!

1532
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:56,890
lt doesn´t matter.

1533
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,060
lt does matter!

1534
01:32:58,130 --> 01:32:59,560
Warst du am
maschinengewehr?

1535
01:32:59,630 --> 01:33:01,690
Nein. lch hab nachgeladen,
ich hab nicht geschossen.

1536
01:33:01,770 --> 01:33:03,740
Shut up with that
filthy pig latin.

1537
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:06,140
Sprichst du deutsch?

1538
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:07,640
Jackson,
you´re hit.

1539
01:33:10,680 --> 01:33:12,440
Shut up.

1540
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:14,070
I guess it just
skinned the arm, sir.

1541
01:33:14,150 --> 01:33:15,910
Miller: Get it
cleaned and dressed.

1542
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,920
You and Sarge
watch the perimeter.

1543
01:33:17,980 --> 01:33:19,320
Bitte, totet mich nicht.

1544
01:33:19,390 --> 01:33:21,510
Bitte, totet mich nicht.
lch will mich ergeben.

1545
01:33:21,590 --> 01:33:23,020
He says
please don´t shoot.

1546
01:33:23,090 --> 01:33:24,560
I don´t care what
he says, Upham.

1547
01:33:26,730 --> 01:33:29,720
Sir? Sir, you´re gonna
let them kill him?

1548
01:33:29,800 --> 01:33:32,700
This is not right, sir.

1549
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:34,960
You can help him
with the bodies.

1550
01:33:37,300 --> 01:33:39,500
What is happening?

1551
01:34:01,030 --> 01:34:02,490
This is bullshit.

1552
01:35:32,890 --> 01:35:35,180
I like American.

1553
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,760
Steamboat Willie.
Toot, toot.

1554
01:35:44,830 --> 01:35:46,530
Steamboat Willie.

1555
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:49,400
Yeah, Steamboat Willie.
American.

1556
01:35:54,640 --> 01:35:57,370
lch bin noch nicht fertig!

1557
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,380
lch muss hier noch
viel tiefer graben!

1558
01:35:59,450 --> 01:36:00,740
lst noch lange
nicht tief genug!

1559
01:36:00,810 --> 01:36:01,840
He´s says he´s
not finished.

1560
01:36:01,910 --> 01:36:03,380
That´s what you think.
Come on.

1561
01:36:03,450 --> 01:36:04,850
- Nein!
- Yeah.

1562
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,510
Nein! lch bin
noch nicht fertig!

1563
01:36:14,490 --> 01:36:15,890
Please...

1564
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:19,290
I like America.

1565
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,460
Fancy schmancy!
What a cinch!

1566
01:36:21,530 --> 01:36:25,100
Go fly a kite! Cat got
your tongue! Cool beans!

1567
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:31,740
Betty Boop! What a dish!

1568
01:36:31,810 --> 01:36:34,040
Betty rable. Nice gams.

1569
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,830
Fuck Hitler.

1570
01:36:59,910 --> 01:37:01,960
Fuck Hitler.

1571
01:37:02,040 --> 01:37:05,270
Tut mir leid um den mann,
den ihr verloren habt.

1572
01:37:05,340 --> 01:37:08,510
Den sanitater.
Es ist halt krieg, nicht?

1573
01:37:08,580 --> 01:37:11,980
Sir, he says
he´s sorry about Wade.

1574
01:37:12,050 --> 01:37:14,880
He says he´s sorry
about Wade, sir.

1575
01:37:14,950 --> 01:37:16,950
Captain!

1576
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:19,150
Captain,
this isn´t right!

1577
01:37:19,230 --> 01:37:21,630
You know this.
He´s a prisoner.

1578
01:37:21,690 --> 01:37:23,130
He surrendered.

1579
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:25,190
He surrendered, sir!

1580
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:37,780
Tell him...

1581
01:37:40,150 --> 01:37:42,980
to march a thousand paces
in that direction.

1582
01:37:43,050 --> 01:37:44,170
Then he can take off
the blindfold.

1583
01:37:44,250 --> 01:37:45,340
We´ll be gone,

1584
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:46,780
and he turns himself in

1585
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:48,080
to the first Allied patrol
he comes across.

1586
01:37:48,150 --> 01:37:49,210
You gotta be kidding.
We´re letting him go?

1587
01:37:49,290 --> 01:37:51,520
He´s a P.Go.W.,
Reiben.

1588
01:37:51,590 --> 01:37:53,320
Can´t take him with us.

1589
01:37:53,390 --> 01:37:55,790
Our guys´ll pick him up
sooner or later.

1590
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:09,000
Only if he doesn´t get picked up
by his own wehrmacht first,

1591
01:38:09,070 --> 01:38:11,070
then thrown back
into circulation.

1592
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:15,880
Captain, you just let
the enemy go.

1593
01:38:15,950 --> 01:38:17,710
This is
such bullshit.

1594
01:38:17,780 --> 01:38:19,110
Y´all got that right.

1595
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:21,780
Bullshit?
This is bullshit?

1596
01:38:21,850 --> 01:38:23,450
Shooting a prisoner,
that´d be OK?

1597
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:24,750
lt´s against
the goddamn rules!

1598
01:38:24,820 --> 01:38:26,120
The goddamn rules
just walked off

1599
01:38:26,190 --> 01:38:27,780
with your new friend.

1600
01:38:30,560 --> 01:38:33,230
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do,

1601
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:34,890
huh, Captain?

1602
01:38:41,610 --> 01:38:44,040
Get your gear.
Let´s go.

1603
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:47,980
Horvath: You heard him.
ear up.

1604
01:38:49,650 --> 01:38:51,450
The captain
just gave you an order.

1605
01:38:51,550 --> 01:38:52,950
Yeah.

1606
01:38:53,020 --> 01:38:55,280
Like the one he gave to
take this machine gun.

1607
01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:56,980
That was a real doozy,
wasn´t it, Sarge?

1608
01:38:57,060 --> 01:38:58,490
Soldier, you are
way outta line.

1609
01:38:58,590 --> 01:39:00,490
Yes, sir, that was
one hell of a call,

1610
01:39:00,590 --> 01:39:01,750
coming to take
this nest,

1611
01:39:01,830 --> 01:39:03,260
but, what the hell,

1612
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:05,060
we only lost one of
our guys going for it.

1613
01:39:05,130 --> 01:39:07,060
I hope Mama Ryan´s
real fuckin´ happy

1614
01:39:07,130 --> 01:39:08,900
knowing that
little Jimmy´s life

1615
01:39:08,970 --> 01:39:10,940
is more important
than 2 of our guys!

1616
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:12,940
Then again, we haven´t
found him yet, have we?

1617
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:14,170
Huh?!

1618
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:17,300
Get the hell off me!

1619
01:39:17,380 --> 01:39:18,740
Horvath:
Reiben, get up.

1620
01:39:20,980 --> 01:39:24,510
ear up. Fall in.

1621
01:39:29,090 --> 01:39:31,780
I´m done with
this mission.

1622
01:39:36,460 --> 01:39:38,490
Hey! Hey!

1623
01:39:39,830 --> 01:39:42,100
Don´t you walk away
from your captain.

1624
01:39:42,170 --> 01:39:43,630
Reiben, get back in line.

1625
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:45,830
I´ll spend the rest of
my life in the stockade

1626
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,300
if I have to,
but I´m done with this.

1627
01:39:47,370 --> 01:39:49,030
I´m not gonna ask
you again, soldier.

1628
01:39:49,110 --> 01:39:50,040
Captain!

1629
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:51,300
Jackson:
This is bullshit!

1630
01:39:51,380 --> 01:39:52,540
Fall in!

1631
01:39:52,610 --> 01:39:53,840
You gonna shoot me
over Ryan?

1632
01:39:53,910 --> 01:39:55,380
No, I´m gonna shoot you
´cause I don´t like you.

1633
01:39:55,450 --> 01:39:56,380
Sir!

1634
01:39:56,450 --> 01:39:57,970
lf he wants to go,
just let him go!

1635
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:00,250
Are you letting
this happen?

1636
01:40:00,320 --> 01:40:01,840
Captain!
You see this?

1637
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,010
Captain? Sir?
Sir, Ryan´s dead.

1638
01:40:05,090 --> 01:40:06,020
Bullshit!

1639
01:40:06,090 --> 01:40:07,560
Sir, we have
a situation.

1640
01:40:07,590 --> 01:40:09,060
I have a sixth sense
about these things.

1641
01:40:09,130 --> 01:40:10,190
I know it
in my bones.

1642
01:40:10,260 --> 01:40:11,700
You don´t kill that
son of a bitch kraut.

1643
01:40:11,760 --> 01:40:12,860
Now you´re gonna
shoot me?

1644
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:13,960
He´s better than you.

1645
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:15,690
Then why don´t you
just do it, Sarge?

1646
01:40:15,770 --> 01:40:17,030
Do it, man.
Put one in my leg--

1647
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:20,160
I´m gonna shoot you
in your big goddamn mouth!

1648
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,040
Well, put your money
where your mouth is--

1649
01:40:22,110 --> 01:40:24,870
You don´t know when to shut up.
You don´t know how to shut up.

1650
01:40:24,940 --> 01:40:26,340
Captain, please!

1651
01:40:26,410 --> 01:40:28,350
What´s the pool
on me up to?

1652
01:40:28,410 --> 01:40:29,750
What?

1653
01:40:29,820 --> 01:40:31,680
You are a coward
son of a bitch!

1654
01:40:31,750 --> 01:40:33,240
I´m waiting,
Sarge.

1655
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:36,120
Mike, what´s the pool
on me up to right now?

1656
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:38,520
What-- What´s it up to?

1657
01:40:38,590 --> 01:40:41,790
What is it, $300?
ls that it, 300?

1658
01:40:41,860 --> 01:40:43,890
I´m a schoolteacher.

1659
01:40:47,870 --> 01:40:51,200
I teach English composition

1660
01:40:51,270 --> 01:40:53,570
in this little town called
Addley, Pennsylvania.

1661
01:40:53,640 --> 01:40:56,400
The last 11 years,

1662
01:40:56,480 --> 01:40:58,840
I´ve been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

1663
01:41:01,380 --> 01:41:03,310
I was the coach
of the baseball team

1664
01:41:03,380 --> 01:41:05,250
in the springtime.

1665
01:41:07,050 --> 01:41:09,490
I´ll be dogone.

1666
01:41:09,560 --> 01:41:13,150
Back home, when I´d tell people
what I do for a living,

1667
01:41:13,230 --> 01:41:17,030
they´d think,
"Well, that figures."

1668
01:41:17,100 --> 01:41:21,290
But over here,
it´s a...

1669
01:41:21,370 --> 01:41:24,770
a big...

1670
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:26,330
a big mystery.

1671
01:41:26,410 --> 01:41:31,600
So I guess
I´ve changed some.

1672
01:41:31,640 --> 01:41:36,100
Sometimes I wonder
if I´ve changed so much,

1673
01:41:36,180 --> 01:41:37,810
my wife is even going
to recognize me

1674
01:41:37,880 --> 01:41:40,080
whenever it is
I get back to her.

1675
01:41:41,750 --> 01:41:46,920
And how I´ll ever
be able to...

1676
01:41:46,990 --> 01:41:49,520
to tell her about
days like today.

1677
01:41:52,460 --> 01:41:55,830
Ah, Ryan...

1678
01:41:55,900 --> 01:41:57,430
I don´t know anything
about Ryan.

1679
01:41:57,500 --> 01:41:59,400
I don´t care.

1680
01:41:59,470 --> 01:42:02,070
The man means nothing to me.
He´s just a name.

1681
01:42:02,140 --> 01:42:05,110
But if...

1682
01:42:05,180 --> 01:42:07,150
you know,
if going to Ramelle and...

1683
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:09,150
finding him so he can go home,

1684
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:11,310
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife,

1685
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:15,480
well then...
then that´s my mission.

1686
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:18,990
You want to leave?

1687
01:42:19,060 --> 01:42:22,620
You want to go off
and fight the war?

1688
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:27,160
All right.

1689
01:42:27,230 --> 01:42:30,070
All right,
I won´t stop you.

1690
01:42:30,140 --> 01:42:32,330
I´ll even put in
the paperwork.

1691
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:36,300
I just know that
every man I kill,

1692
01:42:36,380 --> 01:42:38,370
the farther away
from home I feel.

1693
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:51,510
Half-track! Cover!

1694
01:45:07,690 --> 01:45:09,720
Who´s doing the shooting?

1695
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,660
Who´s doing the shooting?

1696
01:45:28,380 --> 01:45:29,970
Aah!

1697
01:45:31,620 --> 01:45:33,550
Get ready to move on
their left flank!

1698
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:34,710
Take their left flank!

1699
01:45:34,790 --> 01:45:36,650
Mellish: Hold on and
make sure they´re down!

1700
01:45:58,610 --> 01:46:01,740
Corporal Henderson: 101st!
We´re coming out!

1701
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:13,220
Corporal Henderson: That was
a recon element, Second S.S.

1702
01:46:13,290 --> 01:46:15,660
We´ve been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

1703
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:21,830
Captain Miller,
Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1704
01:46:21,900 --> 01:46:23,890
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501st.

1705
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,700
Ryan, first of the 506th.

1706
01:46:25,770 --> 01:46:28,070
P.F.C. Toynbe,
third of the 506th.

1707
01:46:28,140 --> 01:46:30,370
James Francis Ryan?

1708
01:46:30,440 --> 01:46:32,970
Yes, sir.
How´d you guess that?

1709
01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:47,280
Miller: Looks like you guys
got hit pretty hard.

1710
01:46:47,330 --> 01:46:51,590
Henderson: Yes, sir.
Small unit action.

1711
01:46:53,230 --> 01:46:56,890
They came in and beat
the hell out of us with 88s.

1712
01:47:03,110 --> 01:47:04,700
Tell you what, sir,
if you´re our relief,

1713
01:47:04,740 --> 01:47:06,840
I´m gonna file a complaint.

1714
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:09,440
I wouldn´t
blame you.

1715
01:47:09,510 --> 01:47:12,380
Who´s your C.Go.?

1716
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:15,350
lt would have been
Captain Jennings, sir.

1717
01:47:15,420 --> 01:47:16,850
I´m afraid the best
we can muster up

1718
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,750
right now is a corporal.

1719
01:47:19,990 --> 01:47:22,520
So, what are you guys
all about?

1720
01:47:23,600 --> 01:47:27,460
We´re here
for him. Ryan.

1721
01:47:27,530 --> 01:47:28,690
Me, sir?

1722
01:47:38,140 --> 01:47:41,770
James Francis Ryan
of lowa?

1723
01:47:41,850 --> 01:47:44,580
Yes, sir. Payton, lowa,
That´s correct.

1724
01:47:44,620 --> 01:47:47,020
What is this about?

1725
01:47:48,620 --> 01:47:51,420
Your brothers
were killed in combat.

1726
01:47:58,130 --> 01:48:00,360
Which-- Which ones?

1727
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:03,930
All of them.

1728
01:48:10,610 --> 01:48:12,940
Uh...

1729
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:15,540
on-- on the level?

1730
01:48:16,980 --> 01:48:19,080
Yeah. I´m afraid so.

1731
01:48:19,180 --> 01:48:21,710
Uh...

1732
01:48:21,790 --> 01:48:23,380
you might want to take
some time with this.

1733
01:48:23,460 --> 01:48:26,620
lf there´s someplace
you want to go and...

1734
01:48:35,770 --> 01:48:37,260
What´s this all about?

1735
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:38,890
Ryan lost
his brothers.

1736
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:40,200
Which one?

1737
01:48:40,270 --> 01:48:41,640
All of them.

1738
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:47,640
You--

1739
01:48:50,320 --> 01:48:53,080
You came all the way
out here to tell me that?

1740
01:48:55,190 --> 01:48:57,350
Well, you´re--
you´re going home.

1741
01:48:58,790 --> 01:49:01,380
Our orders are
to bring you back.

1742
01:49:04,900 --> 01:49:06,630
Bring me back?

1743
01:49:08,700 --> 01:49:10,330
Corporal Henderson...

1744
01:49:10,400 --> 01:49:12,800
I don´t mean to leave you
even more shorthanded,

1745
01:49:12,870 --> 01:49:14,810
but orders are orders.
Any communication

1746
01:49:14,870 --> 01:49:16,600
about when you´re going
to be relieved up here?

1747
01:49:16,640 --> 01:49:18,070
Sir, there´s
no way to tell.

1748
01:49:18,180 --> 01:49:19,640
We have no idea what´s
happening south of us.

1749
01:49:19,710 --> 01:49:21,650
I have my orders,
too, sir.

1750
01:49:21,710 --> 01:49:23,240
They don´t include me
abandoning my post.

1751
01:49:23,320 --> 01:49:26,110
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1752
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:28,280
I don´t see
that it does, sir.

1753
01:49:30,090 --> 01:49:32,020
The chief of staff
for the United States Army

1754
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:33,280
says it does.

1755
01:49:33,360 --> 01:49:36,230
Sir, our orders are to hold
this bridge at all cost.

1756
01:49:36,290 --> 01:49:39,090
Our planes in the 82nd
have taken out every bridge

1757
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,720
across the Merderet
with the exception of 2.

1758
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,660
One at Valognes
and this one here.

1759
01:49:42,730 --> 01:49:44,200
We let the Germans
take ´em,

1760
01:49:44,270 --> 01:49:46,030
we´ll lose our foothold
and have to displace.

1761
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:48,070
Private, your outfit wants
to stay, that´s one thing.

1762
01:49:48,140 --> 01:49:50,610
Your party´s over here.

1763
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:52,700
Sir, I can´t leave until
at least reinforcements--

1764
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:55,140
You got 3 minutes
to gather your gear.

1765
01:49:55,250 --> 01:49:57,410
Sir, what about them?
There´s barely enough--

1766
01:49:57,480 --> 01:49:59,070
Reiben: Hey, asshole!

1767
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:02,640
2 of our guys already died
trying to find you, all right?

1768
01:50:08,360 --> 01:50:10,330
Sir?

1769
01:50:10,400 --> 01:50:11,590
That´s right.

1770
01:50:20,910 --> 01:50:22,670
What were their names?

1771
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:25,540
lrwin Wade and
Adrian Caparzo.

1772
01:50:27,480 --> 01:50:29,380
Wade and...

1773
01:50:29,450 --> 01:50:32,380
Caparzo.

1774
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:46,360
lt doesn´t make any sense.

1775
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:50,630
lt doesn´t make
any sense, sir.

1776
01:50:50,670 --> 01:50:53,230
Why? Why do I
deserve to go?

1777
01:50:53,340 --> 01:50:54,740
Why not any of
these guys?

1778
01:50:54,810 --> 01:50:56,140
They all fought
just as hard as me!

1779
01:51:00,810 --> 01:51:04,300
ls that what they´re
supposed to tell your mother

1780
01:51:04,380 --> 01:51:07,550
when they send her another
folded American flag?

1781
01:51:14,530 --> 01:51:17,020
Tell her
that when you found me,

1782
01:51:17,100 --> 01:51:20,830
I was here with the only
brothers I have left.

1783
01:51:20,900 --> 01:51:25,200
And that there´s no way
I was gonna desert them.

1784
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:27,830
I think
she´ll understand that.

1785
01:51:27,910 --> 01:51:30,170
There´s no way
I´m leaving this bridge.

1786
01:52:13,520 --> 01:52:15,150
What are your orders?

1787
01:52:17,260 --> 01:52:21,320
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1788
01:52:21,430 --> 01:52:24,490
The world has taken
a turn for the surreal.

1789
01:52:24,560 --> 01:52:27,430
Clearly, but the question
still stands.

1790
01:52:27,500 --> 01:52:29,900
I don´t know.

1791
01:52:29,970 --> 01:52:31,530
What do you think?

1792
01:52:31,600 --> 01:52:34,300
You don´t want to know
what I think.

1793
01:52:36,670 --> 01:52:39,170
No, Mike, I do.

1794
01:52:39,240 --> 01:52:42,110
Well...

1795
01:52:42,180 --> 01:52:44,110
part of me thinks
the kid´s right.

1796
01:52:44,180 --> 01:52:46,120
What´s he done
to deserve this?

1797
01:52:46,180 --> 01:52:48,120
lf he wants
to stay here, fine.

1798
01:52:48,190 --> 01:52:50,480
Let´s leave him
and go home.

1799
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:53,250
Yeah.

1800
01:52:53,320 --> 01:52:55,260
But another
part of me thinks...

1801
01:52:55,330 --> 01:52:58,730
what if by
some miracle we stay

1802
01:52:58,800 --> 01:53:01,600
and actually make it
out of here?

1803
01:53:01,630 --> 01:53:04,120
Some day we might look
back on this and decide

1804
01:53:04,200 --> 01:53:08,730
that saving Private Ryan
was the one decent thing

1805
01:53:08,810 --> 01:53:10,270
we were able
to pull out of

1806
01:53:10,340 --> 01:53:15,370
this whole god-awful,
shitty mess.

1807
01:53:15,480 --> 01:53:19,810
That´s what
I was thinking, sir.

1808
01:53:19,880 --> 01:53:22,380
Like you said, Captain,

1809
01:53:22,490 --> 01:53:25,420
if we do that...

1810
01:53:25,490 --> 01:53:28,930
we all earn
the right to go home.

1811
01:53:31,700 --> 01:53:33,220
Oh, brother.

1812
01:53:36,030 --> 01:53:39,630
Trask:
This is everything.

1813
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:42,100
You got the 2 30-caliber
machine guns,

1814
01:53:42,170 --> 01:53:43,700
17 grenades,

1815
01:53:43,780 --> 01:53:46,040
11 Hawkins mines.

1816
01:53:46,110 --> 01:53:49,570
You got the 2 bazookas, but
they only got 8 rounds left,

1817
01:53:49,610 --> 01:53:51,670
and assorted small arms.

1818
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:53,510
We had a 60 mortar,

1819
01:53:53,590 --> 01:53:55,180
but an arty round
took it out.

1820
01:53:55,250 --> 01:53:58,150
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1821
01:53:58,220 --> 01:54:00,280
Which they´re sure to do.

1822
01:54:00,360 --> 01:54:01,520
What you thinking, sir?

1823
01:54:01,590 --> 01:54:02,890
Well...

1824
01:54:02,960 --> 01:54:03,890
I´m thinking
they´re going to try

1825
01:54:03,960 --> 01:54:05,900
to whip around
the flanks--

1826
01:54:10,640 --> 01:54:12,930
Miller: Unless we can draw
them up this main road here

1827
01:54:13,000 --> 01:54:14,130
in-between these buildings

1828
01:54:14,210 --> 01:54:17,640
where all the rubble makes
a bit of a bottleneck.

1829
01:54:17,710 --> 01:54:19,230
Disable ´em?

1830
01:54:19,310 --> 01:54:20,370
lf we can.

1831
01:54:20,480 --> 01:54:21,840
Make that tank
a 60-ton roadblock.

1832
01:54:21,910 --> 01:54:23,440
We do that, we got a fighting
chance at their flanks.

1833
01:54:23,550 --> 01:54:25,020
Yes, sir, that´s good.

1834
01:54:25,080 --> 01:54:26,550
Split them up.
Don´t let them mass anywhere.

1835
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:27,920
Hit them hard as we can
one-on-one

1836
01:54:27,990 --> 01:54:29,610
and fall back
to the bridge.

1837
01:54:29,690 --> 01:54:30,620
Machine gun
on the move down here,

1838
01:54:30,690 --> 01:54:31,680
number 2
up high somewhere

1839
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,920
to piss a little bad
news on their heads.

1840
01:54:33,990 --> 01:54:36,620
Miller: That would be
the idea.

1841
01:54:36,660 --> 01:54:38,790
Jackson?

1842
01:54:38,860 --> 01:54:40,630
lf we can, I´d like to get
you up in that bell tower.

1843
01:54:40,700 --> 01:54:42,170
Yes, sir.

1844
01:54:42,230 --> 01:54:44,390
Give you a little company
if you need it.

1845
01:54:44,500 --> 01:54:46,400
Yes, sir. Some company
couldn´t hurt.

1846
01:54:46,500 --> 01:54:48,300
I´d say a...

1847
01:54:48,370 --> 01:54:49,670
a 30 with about
a thousand rounds

1848
01:54:49,740 --> 01:54:50,670
would be OK.

1849
01:54:50,740 --> 01:54:52,770
Parker,
job opportunity.

1850
01:54:52,840 --> 01:54:54,740
Reiben: lt´s not the worst
idea ever, Captain.

1851
01:54:54,810 --> 01:54:56,280
lt´s just that everything
depends on getting the tank

1852
01:54:56,350 --> 01:54:58,610
down this main road for us
to knock out, right?

1853
01:54:58,680 --> 01:55:01,310
So, how the hell do you
plan on doing that?

1854
01:55:01,390 --> 01:55:03,080
Horvath: Reiben´s right.

1855
01:55:03,150 --> 01:55:05,150
As our esteemed colleague
from the airborne pointed out,

1856
01:55:05,220 --> 01:55:07,520
what we got here are
a bunch of spit wads,

1857
01:55:07,590 --> 01:55:09,530
so how do we stop the tank

1858
01:55:09,590 --> 01:55:11,530
if we get it to commit?

1859
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,090
Give it a rabbit
to chase.

1860
01:55:14,170 --> 01:55:16,760
We could hit the tank
in the tracks.

1861
01:55:16,830 --> 01:55:18,630
Yeah, but with what?

1862
01:55:21,240 --> 01:55:23,430
Well, we could try
a sticky bomb.

1863
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:24,940
Ryan:
Sticky bomb, sir?

1864
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:28,410
Sir, are you
making that up?

1865
01:55:28,480 --> 01:55:29,640
No. lt´s
in the field manual.

1866
01:55:29,710 --> 01:55:31,310
You check it out
if you want to.

1867
01:55:31,380 --> 01:55:34,150
Well, we seem to be
out of field manuals, sir.

1868
01:55:34,220 --> 01:55:36,210
Perhaps you can
enlighten us.

1869
01:55:36,290 --> 01:55:37,580
All right, you have some
demolition, don´t you?

1870
01:55:37,620 --> 01:55:39,610
Some TNT or
some composition "B"?

1871
01:55:39,690 --> 01:55:41,390
That, sir, is the one
thing we got plenty of.

1872
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:43,190
I got that bridge wired
with enough composition "B"

1873
01:55:43,260 --> 01:55:44,290
to blow it twice.

1874
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:45,660
All right, you can
spare some, then.

1875
01:55:45,730 --> 01:55:49,720
You take
a standard-issue .I. sock,

1876
01:55:49,800 --> 01:55:52,790
cram it with as much
comp "B" as it can hold,

1877
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:55,240
rig up a simple fuse,

1878
01:55:55,310 --> 01:55:58,070
then you coat the whole
thing with axle grease.

1879
01:55:58,140 --> 01:56:00,170
That way,
when you throw it,

1880
01:56:00,240 --> 01:56:01,710
it should stick.

1881
01:56:01,780 --> 01:56:04,340
lt´s a bomb that sticks.
lt´s a sticky bomb.

1882
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:05,350
You come up
with a better way

1883
01:56:05,420 --> 01:56:06,750
to knock the tracks
off a tank,

1884
01:56:06,820 --> 01:56:08,620
I´m all ears.

1885
01:56:08,650 --> 01:56:09,640
This is good.

1886
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:12,660
Now we got
to surrender our socks.

1887
01:56:26,640 --> 01:56:27,660
Haul away.

1888
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:44,080
All right, select
the field of fire.

1889
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,120
Cross fire with the one
in the bell tower.

1890
01:56:46,190 --> 01:56:48,560
All right. I can cover
12 to  from here.

1891
01:56:52,860 --> 01:56:53,990
Soldier: Easy!

1892
01:56:54,070 --> 01:56:55,500
Jackson: I got her!

1893
01:57:29,230 --> 01:57:30,830
Here are the mines.

1894
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:44,770
For being the best
we can do,

1895
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:45,840
that forward machine gun

1896
01:57:45,920 --> 01:57:48,850
is not in a terrible
firing position.

1897
01:57:51,390 --> 01:57:53,360
And this position
right here...

1898
01:57:55,930 --> 01:57:58,050
this is the Alamo.

1899
01:57:58,130 --> 01:57:59,490
They push us back
this far,

1900
01:57:59,560 --> 01:58:01,760
last man alive
blows the bridge.

1901
01:58:01,830 --> 01:58:03,820
We only got a 30-second
delay on that fuse,

1902
01:58:03,900 --> 01:58:05,890
so let everyone know that
if you are that last man,

1903
01:58:05,970 --> 01:58:06,960
you better hurry
your ass off,

1904
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:10,270
or you´re not going
to be alive long.

1905
01:58:10,340 --> 01:58:11,930
Captain?

1906
01:58:12,010 --> 01:58:14,500
Where am I during all this?

1907
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:16,510
Never more than 2 feet
away from me,

1908
01:58:16,580 --> 01:58:18,010
and that´s not negotiable.

1909
01:58:19,780 --> 01:58:21,270
I´ll get some ammo.

1910
01:58:21,350 --> 01:58:22,280
Come on.

1911
01:58:25,360 --> 01:58:26,550
- Hey, Upham.
- Yes.

1912
01:58:26,620 --> 01:58:27,560
Listen to me, all right?

1913
01:58:27,630 --> 01:58:28,650
Yeah.

1914
01:58:28,760 --> 01:58:29,660
You listening?

1915
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:31,320
- Yes.
- All right.

1916
01:58:31,400 --> 01:58:32,920
We´re going to be
displacing

1917
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,230
and falling back like
crazy sons of bitches...

1918
01:58:34,300 --> 01:58:35,290
right up there.

1919
01:58:35,370 --> 01:58:36,300
So you got to be
Johnny-on-the-spot

1920
01:58:36,370 --> 01:58:38,960
with the ammo,
or we´re dead.

1921
01:58:39,040 --> 01:58:39,970
Right.

1922
01:58:40,040 --> 01:58:40,970
You understand that?

1923
01:58:41,040 --> 01:58:42,970
- Johnny-on-the-spot.
- Yeah.

1924
01:58:43,040 --> 01:58:43,970
You all right?

1925
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:46,630
- Hmm?
- Yes.

1926
01:58:46,680 --> 01:58:48,440
You know, when we were
shipping out of England,

1927
01:58:48,510 --> 01:58:50,210
the supply sergeant was handing
out cartons of cigarettes,

1928
01:58:50,280 --> 01:58:54,270
and I said, "No, thank you.
I don´t smoke.

1929
01:58:54,350 --> 01:58:55,790
I don´t smoke."

1930
01:58:57,490 --> 01:58:59,620
Quite a situation, huh?

1931
01:58:59,690 --> 01:59:01,590
Unbelievable.

1932
01:59:01,630 --> 01:59:02,650
Here.

1933
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:04,060
Fucked up

1934
01:59:04,130 --> 01:59:07,290
beyond all recognition,
right?

1935
01:59:07,370 --> 01:59:09,300
Yeah,
you got that right.

1936
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:13,400
FUBAR.

1937
01:59:15,510 --> 01:59:16,870
Ouch. Ahem.

1938
01:59:16,940 --> 01:59:17,870
Yeah, well...

1939
01:59:17,940 --> 01:59:18,870
FUBAR.

1940
01:59:18,940 --> 01:59:20,410
lt´s going to be
a real show, huh?

1941
01:59:21,480 --> 01:59:22,840
Yeah, OK.

1942
01:59:29,350 --> 01:59:30,790
Take it easy.

1943
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:33,550
FUBAR.

1944
02:00:11,660 --> 02:00:13,220
Who´s that
singing, sir?

1945
02:00:14,970 --> 02:00:16,300
Edith Piaf.

1946
02:00:18,370 --> 02:00:20,770
Ryan: What´s she
so upset about?

1947
02:00:21,910 --> 02:00:23,400
Her lover left her,

1948
02:00:23,470 --> 02:00:26,910
but she still sees his face
everywhere she goes.

1949
02:00:28,280 --> 02:00:29,680
That would do it.

1950
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:00,640
Even life itself

1951
02:01:00,710 --> 02:01:02,180
only represents you.

1952
02:01:05,550 --> 02:01:07,140
Sometimes I dream

1953
02:01:07,220 --> 02:01:08,650
that I´m in your arms.

1954
02:01:08,720 --> 02:01:10,620
What was that part?
She sang that before.

1955
02:01:10,660 --> 02:01:11,710
That´s the chorus.

1956
02:01:11,790 --> 02:01:13,650
The chorus.

1957
02:01:13,720 --> 02:01:16,660
And you speak softly
in my ear...

1958
02:01:18,430 --> 02:01:20,690
and you say things

1959
02:01:20,770 --> 02:01:22,930
that make my eyes close.

1960
02:01:25,670 --> 02:01:27,500
And I find that
marvelous.

1961
02:01:27,570 --> 02:01:29,510
Uh, again...

1962
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:31,100
Upham, uh...

1963
02:01:31,180 --> 02:01:33,470
to be honest with you,
I-- I find myself

1964
02:01:33,540 --> 02:01:34,700
curiously
aroused by you.

1965
02:01:36,610 --> 02:01:38,240
Marvelous.

1966
02:01:38,320 --> 02:01:40,050
No, it´s-- You know, it´s
a really melancholy song.

1967
02:01:40,120 --> 02:01:42,180
At the beginning
of the song, she says,

1968
02:01:42,250 --> 02:01:44,080
"And then one day,
you left.

1969
02:01:44,160 --> 02:01:46,020
You left me, and, uh...

1970
02:01:46,090 --> 02:01:48,150
I´ve been desperate
ever since.

1971
02:01:48,230 --> 02:01:51,320
I see you all over the sky.
I see you all over the Earth."

1972
02:01:51,400 --> 02:01:52,990
Horvath: Jesus, Upham,
any more songs like this,

1973
02:01:53,060 --> 02:01:55,120
the krauts aren´t going
to have to shoot me.

1974
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:58,030
I´m just going to slit
my own wrists.

1975
02:01:58,100 --> 02:01:59,800
Reiben: You know, you´re
a strange bird, Upham.

1976
02:01:59,870 --> 02:02:01,430
Ohh. I´m sorry.

1977
02:02:01,510 --> 02:02:02,630
lt´s Edith, you know.

1978
02:02:02,710 --> 02:02:04,680
You know what that song
reminds me of?

1979
02:02:04,740 --> 02:02:06,610
lt reminds me of
Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz

1980
02:02:06,640 --> 02:02:07,610
and what she said to me

1981
02:02:07,650 --> 02:02:08,870
the day I left
for basic.

1982
02:02:08,980 --> 02:02:10,310
What, "Don´t touch me"?

1983
02:02:11,720 --> 02:02:12,810
No.
Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz

1984
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:14,410
is our super´s wife.

1985
02:02:14,490 --> 02:02:15,650
She comes
into my mom´s shop

1986
02:02:15,720 --> 02:02:17,150
to try on a few things,
all right?

1987
02:02:17,220 --> 02:02:21,060
And she´s easily, like,
a 44 double "E."

1988
02:02:21,130 --> 02:02:22,060
Double "E"?

1989
02:02:22,130 --> 02:02:23,060
These things
are massive, right?

1990
02:02:23,130 --> 02:02:24,360
Those are big.

1991
02:02:24,430 --> 02:02:25,590
No.
And I´ve got her convinced

1992
02:02:25,630 --> 02:02:27,290
that she´s, like,
a 42 "D," all right?

1993
02:02:27,370 --> 02:02:28,830
So we´re
in the dressing room.

1994
02:02:28,900 --> 02:02:31,090
She´s trying to squeeze
into this side-cut,

1995
02:02:31,170 --> 02:02:32,900
silk-ribboned,
triple-panel girdle

1996
02:02:33,000 --> 02:02:34,490
with the shelf-lift
brassiere.

1997
02:02:34,570 --> 02:02:36,230
And it´s beautiful,

1998
02:02:36,310 --> 02:02:38,070
because she´s just pouring
out of this thing, you know?

1999
02:02:38,140 --> 02:02:39,070
ls it really tight?

2000
02:02:39,140 --> 02:02:40,080
No, no. lt´s beautiful.

2001
02:02:40,140 --> 02:02:41,270
And she sees me,
and she can tell

2002
02:02:41,350 --> 02:02:44,310
I got a hard-on the size
of the Statue of Liberty.

2003
02:02:44,380 --> 02:02:46,370
And she says to me,
"Richard, calm down."

2004
02:02:46,450 --> 02:02:47,880
And she says,

2005
02:02:47,990 --> 02:02:49,010
"When you´re over there,

2006
02:02:49,090 --> 02:02:50,850
if you see anything
that upsets you,

2007
02:02:50,920 --> 02:02:52,010
or if you´re ever scared,

2008
02:02:52,090 --> 02:02:54,020
I want you to close
your eyes

2009
02:02:54,090 --> 02:02:55,620
and think of these.

2010
02:02:55,660 --> 02:02:56,680
You understand?"

2011
02:02:58,700 --> 02:03:00,660
So I said, "Yes, ma´am."

2012
02:03:13,740 --> 02:03:16,840
Ryan: Are you
all right, sir?

2013
02:03:16,910 --> 02:03:18,310
Yeah. I´m just
keeping the rhythm.

2014
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:28,580
ls it true you were
a teacher back home?

2015
02:03:28,630 --> 02:03:29,820
Yes.

2016
02:03:29,890 --> 02:03:32,620
See, that´s something
I could never do, you know?

2017
02:03:32,660 --> 02:03:33,790
Not after the way
me and my brothers

2018
02:03:33,860 --> 02:03:35,260
tGreated our teachers.

2019
02:03:35,330 --> 02:03:36,820
No, sir.

2020
02:03:39,570 --> 02:03:42,510
I had a thousand kids
like you.

2021
02:03:48,210 --> 02:03:50,610
I can´t see
my brothers´ faces.

2022
02:03:52,280 --> 02:03:53,580
And I´ve been trying,

2023
02:03:53,620 --> 02:03:55,210
and I can´t see
their faces at all.

2024
02:03:55,290 --> 02:03:57,220
Has that ever happened
to you?

2025
02:03:57,290 --> 02:04:00,220
You got to think
of a context.

2026
02:04:01,190 --> 02:04:03,350
What does that mean?

2027
02:04:03,390 --> 02:04:05,420
Well, you don´t just think
about their faces.

2028
02:04:05,500 --> 02:04:07,930
You think about
something specific--

2029
02:04:08,000 --> 02:04:09,470
something you´ve done
together.

2030
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:17,040
Well, when I think of home,
I think of something specific.

2031
02:04:17,140 --> 02:04:21,010
I think of my hammock
in the backyard or...

2032
02:04:21,110 --> 02:04:23,170
my wife pruning
the rose bushes

2033
02:04:23,250 --> 02:04:26,180
in a pair of
my old work gloves.

2034
02:04:29,820 --> 02:04:31,720
Well, this one night,

2035
02:04:31,790 --> 02:04:33,220
two of my brothers came

2036
02:04:33,290 --> 02:04:36,990
and woke me up in
the middle of the night,

2037
02:04:37,090 --> 02:04:40,500
and they said they had
a surprise for me.

2038
02:04:40,560 --> 02:04:43,930
So they took me to the barn,
up into the loft, and...

2039
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:46,470
there was
my oldest brother Dan...

2040
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:51,470
with Alice--
Alice Jardine.

2041
02:04:53,610 --> 02:04:54,980
I mean...

2042
02:04:55,050 --> 02:04:57,310
picture a girl who just
took a nose-dive

2043
02:04:57,380 --> 02:04:58,370
from the ugly tree

2044
02:04:58,450 --> 02:05:00,610
and hit every branch
coming down.

2045
02:05:03,050 --> 02:05:04,880
And-- And Dan´s
got her shirt off.

2046
02:05:04,960 --> 02:05:06,250
So he´s working
on this bra,

2047
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:07,790
and he´s trying
to get it off,

2048
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:10,790
and all of a sudden,
Sean just screams out...

2049
02:05:11,930 --> 02:05:13,790
"Danny, you´re
a young man!

2050
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:14,920
Don´t do it!"

2051
02:05:17,670 --> 02:05:19,500
And so Alice Jardine
hears this,

2052
02:05:19,570 --> 02:05:21,440
and she screams
and she jumps up

2053
02:05:21,510 --> 02:05:23,000
and she tries to get
running out of the barn,

2054
02:05:23,070 --> 02:05:24,440
but she´s still got
this shirt over her head.

2055
02:05:24,510 --> 02:05:26,310
She goes running
right into the wall

2056
02:05:26,380 --> 02:05:28,940
and knocks herself out.

2057
02:05:29,010 --> 02:05:31,350
So now Dan
is just so mad at us.

2058
02:05:31,420 --> 02:05:33,110
He-- He starts
coming after us,

2059
02:05:33,220 --> 02:05:34,240
but at the same time,

2060
02:05:34,320 --> 02:05:35,580
Alice is over there
unconscious.

2061
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:37,180
He´s got to wake her up.

2062
02:05:37,250 --> 02:05:39,350
So he grabs her
by a leg,

2063
02:05:39,420 --> 02:05:40,550
and he´s draging her.

2064
02:05:40,620 --> 02:05:42,290
At the same time,
he picks up a shovel,

2065
02:05:42,360 --> 02:05:44,090
and he´s going
after Sean.

2066
02:05:44,200 --> 02:05:46,360
And Sean said, "What are you
trying to hit me for?

2067
02:05:46,430 --> 02:05:49,130
I just did you a favor."

2068
02:05:49,230 --> 02:05:51,930
And so this makes Dan
more angry.

2069
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:53,900
He tries to swing
this thing.

2070
02:05:53,970 --> 02:05:55,630
He loses the shovel.

2071
02:05:55,670 --> 02:05:57,830
lt goes out of his grasp
and hits a kerosene lantern.

2072
02:05:57,910 --> 02:05:59,210
The thing explodes.

2073
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:00,370
The whole barn
almost goes up

2074
02:06:00,440 --> 02:06:02,110
because of this thing.

2075
02:06:03,710 --> 02:06:04,650
Uhh.

2076
02:06:17,700 --> 02:06:19,060
That was it.
That was the last--

2077
02:06:19,130 --> 02:06:21,220
That was-- Dan went off
to basic the next day.

2078
02:06:21,300 --> 02:06:25,000
That was the last night
the 4 of us were together.

2079
02:06:25,070 --> 02:06:27,130
That was 2 years ago.

2080
02:06:28,470 --> 02:06:30,000
Hmm. Oh, my.

2081
02:06:32,440 --> 02:06:33,380
Ryan: Tell me
about your wife

2082
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:34,840
and those rose bushes.

2083
02:06:37,350 --> 02:06:38,280
No.

2084
02:06:39,680 --> 02:06:43,520
No. That one I save
just for me.

2085
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:49,480
Enemy from the east.

2086
02:07:53,920 --> 02:07:55,860
Panzer tanks, 2 of them;

2087
02:07:55,930 --> 02:07:57,760
infantry,

2088
02:07:57,830 --> 02:07:59,520
50 plus change.

2089
02:08:08,670 --> 02:08:10,400
Disperse.
You know what to do.

2090
02:08:10,470 --> 02:08:11,410
Reiben,
get on the rabbit.

2091
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:12,410
Yes, sir.

2092
02:08:12,480 --> 02:08:13,740
Horvath: Upham,
get some cover.

2093
02:08:13,810 --> 02:08:16,410
Mellish and Henderson,
lock and load!

2094
02:08:16,480 --> 02:08:17,880
Everybody
check your ammo!

2095
02:08:19,220 --> 02:08:20,620
Good luck,
Reiben.

2096
02:08:20,650 --> 02:08:21,710
I don´t need
any luck, Sarge.

2097
02:08:21,790 --> 02:08:23,220
I was born lucky.

2098
02:08:36,800 --> 02:08:38,030
One in five tracer?

2099
02:08:38,100 --> 02:08:40,090
Yep, and tracers
point both ways.

2100
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:41,660
Yeah? Why don´t you
check the head space,

2101
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:43,640
and she should run.

2102
02:08:51,980 --> 02:08:53,450
Upham!

2103
02:08:53,520 --> 02:08:54,610
Hustle up!

2104
02:09:44,700 --> 02:09:45,630
Corporal Upham?

2105
02:09:45,700 --> 02:09:46,630
Yes, sir.

2106
02:09:46,700 --> 02:09:47,860
We don´t have
a 30-caliber machine gun

2107
02:09:47,940 --> 02:09:48,870
in this position.

2108
02:09:48,940 --> 02:09:50,340
Either Mr. Mellish

2109
02:09:50,440 --> 02:09:52,270
or Mr. Jackson in
the bell tower needs that.

2110
02:09:52,340 --> 02:09:53,270
Yes, sir.

2111
02:09:54,550 --> 02:09:55,840
Upham! Jackson´s fine.

2112
02:09:55,910 --> 02:09:56,880
Turn around to Mellish.

2113
02:10:18,670 --> 02:10:20,160
There´s a ton
of infantry, Captain.

2114
02:10:20,240 --> 02:10:22,030
I don´t know if they took
the bait, though.

2115
02:10:47,100 --> 02:10:49,570
You got any more of that?

2116
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:37,110
Panzers didn´t take
the bait.

2117
02:11:42,420 --> 02:11:45,290
lnfantry´s
moving to the left.

2118
02:11:45,360 --> 02:11:48,790
Half-track just went by
with about 20 troops.

2119
02:12:20,060 --> 02:12:22,490
Man: Dies war
die zweiten kompanie!

2120
02:13:27,820 --> 02:13:29,220
Mellish!
Henderson!

2121
02:13:29,290 --> 02:13:31,420
Displace!

2122
02:13:52,480 --> 02:13:54,510
You! Do it now!
Light it up!

2123
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:56,210
You! Light it!

2124
02:14:07,730 --> 02:14:09,720
30 infantry
on the right flank!

2125
02:14:09,800 --> 02:14:12,290
Get over there,
find a hole, and stop them!

2126
02:14:12,370 --> 02:14:13,460
Displace!

2127
02:14:25,620 --> 02:14:26,600
Mellish: Upham!

2128
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,330
Clear!

2129
02:14:45,570 --> 02:14:46,730
Krauts!

2130
02:14:48,810 --> 02:14:49,830
Right flank!

2131
02:15:02,090 --> 02:15:04,020
Soldier: Sanitater!

2132
02:15:18,070 --> 02:15:20,090
Soldier:
Bleiben panzer!

2133
02:15:25,910 --> 02:15:27,880
Get down!

2134
02:15:27,940 --> 02:15:29,540
Get down!

2135
02:15:36,090 --> 02:15:37,350
Upham! Upham!

2136
02:15:37,420 --> 02:15:39,320
30 cal! Hurry!

2137
02:15:39,390 --> 02:15:42,830
And find the captain!
This flank´s going to fold!

2138
02:16:37,210 --> 02:16:39,440
Disperse!
He´s still in this fight!

2139
02:16:40,950 --> 02:16:43,920
No, no, Ryan,
get down! Get down!

2140
02:16:47,660 --> 02:16:49,350
Soldier: Aah! Aah!

2141
02:16:56,300 --> 02:16:57,630
Ryan!

2142
02:17:16,890 --> 02:17:17,790
Ryan!

2143
02:17:20,520 --> 02:17:21,460
Ryan.

2144
02:17:21,520 --> 02:17:22,460
Ryan:
Get off of me!

2145
02:17:22,530 --> 02:17:23,460
Miller:
Are you all right?

2146
02:17:23,530 --> 02:17:24,720
Uhh! Get off of me!

2147
02:17:24,790 --> 02:17:26,920
Reiben: I´m fine, too,
Captain. Thanks.

2148
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,730
Miller: OK, both sides!

2149
02:17:29,800 --> 02:17:31,630
Get aboard!
Get a grenade in there!

2150
02:17:35,640 --> 02:17:36,630
Henderson: renade!

2151
02:17:38,780 --> 02:17:39,900
20 mil!

2152
02:17:39,980 --> 02:17:40,910
20 mil!

2153
02:17:41,980 --> 02:17:43,640
Flak gun, 20 millimeter.
Take it out!

2154
02:17:57,090 --> 02:17:58,530
Heavy weapon
in defilade below!

2155
02:17:58,600 --> 02:18:00,530
I ain´t got a shot!

2156
02:18:05,100 --> 02:18:06,970
Pincer move, Parker!

2157
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:08,600
Targets 8 Go´clock low!

2158
02:18:08,640 --> 02:18:09,610
Parker: Shit!

2159
02:18:09,640 --> 02:18:11,110
God grant me strength.

2160
02:18:25,320 --> 02:18:27,350
Come on! Displace!

2161
02:18:27,420 --> 02:18:28,360
Come on!

2162
02:18:44,640 --> 02:18:46,510
Miller: Cover,
Upham! Cover!

2163
02:18:46,580 --> 02:18:47,870
Cover!

2164
02:18:50,710 --> 02:18:53,770
Aah!

2165
02:19:04,060 --> 02:19:06,490
Parker: I´m out
of 30 caliber.

2166
02:19:09,600 --> 02:19:10,730
Blessed be the Lord,
my strength,

2167
02:19:10,800 --> 02:19:12,270
which teaches
my hands to war

2168
02:19:12,340 --> 02:19:14,270
and my fingers to fight.

2169
02:19:23,310 --> 02:19:25,750
My goodness
and my fortress...

2170
02:19:25,820 --> 02:19:27,810
my high tower
and my Deliverer.

2171
02:19:31,390 --> 02:19:32,550
My shield

2172
02:19:32,620 --> 02:19:33,990
and He in Whom I trust.

2173
02:19:37,590 --> 02:19:39,030
Here you go, baby.

2174
02:20:02,190 --> 02:20:04,450
Parker, get down!

2175
02:20:25,510 --> 02:20:27,980
Captain, that 20 millimeter
is killing us.

2176
02:20:28,080 --> 02:20:30,640
We got to try
to flank it somehow.

2177
02:20:30,680 --> 02:20:33,340
Well, let me get over
for the top shot.

2178
02:20:57,710 --> 02:20:58,640
Upham!

2179
02:21:03,910 --> 02:21:04,880
Crap.

2180
02:21:18,160 --> 02:21:19,150
Upham!

2181
02:21:19,230 --> 02:21:20,530
Upham!

2182
02:21:20,600 --> 02:21:22,790
Upham, ammo,
goddamn it!

2183
02:21:55,900 --> 02:21:57,490
Man:
Haben sie handgrenaden?

2184
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:07,270
I´m jammed!
I´m jammed!

2185
02:22:07,340 --> 02:22:08,280
You got any 30 cal?

2186
02:22:08,340 --> 02:22:09,280
Henderson:
I´m out.

2187
02:22:09,350 --> 02:22:10,280
Shit.

2188
02:22:21,860 --> 02:22:23,120
Upham?

2189
02:22:23,230 --> 02:22:24,160
Upham!

2190
02:22:59,500 --> 02:23:00,690
Aah!

2191
02:23:17,050 --> 02:23:18,100
Reiben!

2192
02:23:19,980 --> 02:23:22,140
Come on! Aah!

2193
02:23:22,250 --> 02:23:23,410
Reiben!

2194
02:23:50,650 --> 02:23:51,740
I´m out!

2195
02:23:51,810 --> 02:23:52,840
I need another bandoleer!

2196
02:23:52,920 --> 02:23:54,410
Anybody got a bandoleer?

2197
02:24:19,610 --> 02:24:20,700
God!

2198
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:22,270
God!

2199
02:24:22,350 --> 02:24:23,280
Aah!

2200
02:24:26,180 --> 02:24:27,510
You stupid...

2201
02:24:29,450 --> 02:24:31,010
Aah!

2202
02:24:32,820 --> 02:24:34,480
Aah!

2203
02:24:40,730 --> 02:24:42,100
Aah!

2204
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:47,640
Ow!

2205
02:24:47,670 --> 02:24:49,370
Aah!

2206
02:24:49,440 --> 02:24:51,300
Aah!

2207
02:25:01,880 --> 02:25:04,440
Unh! Unh! Unh!

2208
02:25:04,520 --> 02:25:06,580
Haah!

2209
02:25:12,760 --> 02:25:14,460
Let´s stop. Let´s stop.
Let´s stop. Listen to me!

2210
02:25:14,530 --> 02:25:15,760
Listen to me!
Stop! Stop!

2211
02:25:15,830 --> 02:25:17,390
No! D-D-D-D--

2212
02:25:17,470 --> 02:25:18,400
Stop. Stop.

2213
02:25:25,910 --> 02:25:28,240
Shh, shh.

2214
02:25:28,340 --> 02:25:29,900
Shh.

2215
02:25:29,980 --> 02:25:31,110
Shh.

2216
02:25:52,400 --> 02:25:53,630
Aah!

2217
02:25:53,670 --> 02:25:56,190
Son of-- Son of a bitch!

2218
02:25:56,270 --> 02:25:57,500
Son of a bitch!

2219
02:25:57,570 --> 02:25:59,060
Son of a bitch!

2220
02:25:59,140 --> 02:26:01,340
Son of a bitch!

2221
02:26:01,440 --> 02:26:03,170
Son of a bitch!

2222
02:27:16,820 --> 02:27:19,480
Zuruck! Ja, genau!
ut so!

2223
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:20,990
eh nach rechts!
Nach rechts!

2224
02:27:22,390 --> 02:27:23,790
I´m out.

2225
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:25,330
Those 60 rounds.

2226
02:27:27,060 --> 02:27:28,590
We can use them
without the tube.

2227
02:27:28,630 --> 02:27:30,060
How?

2228
02:27:30,130 --> 02:27:32,160
Fuse-arming wire,
set back,

2229
02:27:32,240 --> 02:27:33,400
heave it!

2230
02:27:33,500 --> 02:27:34,600
Uhh!

2231
02:27:48,320 --> 02:27:49,650
Panzer schreck!

2232
02:27:57,490 --> 02:27:58,390
Uhh!

2233
02:28:20,980 --> 02:28:21,920
Ow!

2234
02:28:24,720 --> 02:28:26,690
We´re going
to the Alamo.

2235
02:28:36,570 --> 02:28:38,630
Alamo! Alamo!

2236
02:28:51,680 --> 02:28:52,610
Aah!

2237
02:28:58,620 --> 02:29:00,650
We´ll take it!
You fall back!

2238
02:29:00,720 --> 02:29:02,280
You be right behind us!

2239
02:29:02,360 --> 02:29:04,330
Soon as we´re in business!

2240
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:09,630
Displace.

2241
02:29:09,700 --> 02:29:10,630
Reiben.

2242
02:29:12,940 --> 02:29:13,870
Reload.

2243
02:29:55,340 --> 02:29:56,280
Yaah!

2244
02:30:03,290 --> 02:30:04,840
All right, go.

2245
02:30:06,060 --> 02:30:07,110
Miller: We´re
blowing the bridge!

2246
02:30:07,190 --> 02:30:08,880
Get off!
Clear the bridge!

2247
02:30:11,530 --> 02:30:13,360
Oh!

2248
02:30:33,180 --> 02:30:34,910
Sarge!

2249
02:30:34,980 --> 02:30:35,970
Mike, are you
all right?

2250
02:30:36,050 --> 02:30:37,520
I just got the wind
knocked out of me.

2251
02:30:37,590 --> 02:30:38,750
Well, get out of here!

2252

2287
02:36:31,370 --> 02:36:33,200

2289
02:36:41,720 --> 02:36:42,650
Earn it.

2290
02:37:12,150 --> 02:37:15,550
General Marshall:
My Dear Mrs. Ryan,

2291
02:37:15,620 --> 02:37:18,050
it´s with the most
profound sense of joy

2292
02:37:18,120 --> 02:37:21,520
that I write to inform you
your son,

2293
02:37:21,590 --> 02:37:23,720
Private James Ryan,

2294
02:37:23,790 --> 02:37:25,730
is well and,
at this very moment,

2295
02:37:25,790 --> 02:37:29,390
on his way home from
European battlefields.

2296
02:37:29,470 --> 02:37:32,990
Reports from the front indicate
James did his duty in combat

2297
02:37:33,100 --> 02:37:36,870
with great courage
and steadfast dedication

2298
02:37:36,940 --> 02:37:39,570
even after he was informed
of the tragic loss

2299
02:37:39,640 --> 02:37:43,130
your family has suffered
in this great campaign

2300
02:37:43,210 --> 02:37:46,770
to rid the world of tyranny
and oppression.

2301
02:37:46,850 --> 02:37:49,980
I take great pleasure in joining
the secretary of war,

2302
02:37:50,090 --> 02:37:51,750
the men and women
of the United States Army,

2303
02:37:51,820 --> 02:37:54,950
and the citizens
of a grateful nation

2304
02:37:55,020 --> 02:37:57,620
in wishing you good health
and many years of happiness

2305
02:37:57,690 --> 02:38:00,920
with James at your side.

2306
02:38:01,000 --> 02:38:02,120
Nothing,

2307
02:38:02,200 --> 02:38:05,560
not even the safe return
of a beloved son,

2308
02:38:05,630 --> 02:38:07,000
can compensate you

2309
02:38:07,100 --> 02:38:10,200
or the thousands
of other American families

2310
02:38:10,270 --> 02:38:13,640
who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war.

2311
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:15,700
And I might share
with you some words

2312
02:38:15,780 --> 02:38:17,300
which have sustained me

2313
02:38:17,380 --> 02:38:18,740
through long, dark nights

2314
02:38:18,810 --> 02:38:21,580
of peril, loss
and heartache.

2315
02:38:21,620 --> 02:38:24,140
And I quote,

2316
02:38:24,220 --> 02:38:25,910
"I pray
that our Heavenly Father

2317
02:38:25,990 --> 02:38:29,220
may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement

2318
02:38:29,290 --> 02:38:31,420
and leave you only
the cherished memory

2319
02:38:31,490 --> 02:38:33,360
of the loved and lost

2320
02:38:33,430 --> 02:38:35,860
and the solemn pride
that must be yours

2321
02:38:35,930 --> 02:38:38,900
to have laid
so costly a sacrifice

2322
02:38:38,970 --> 02:38:41,230
upon the altar of freedom.

2323
02:38:41,300 --> 02:38:43,600
Abraham Lincoln."

2324
02:38:43,640 --> 02:38:46,370
Yours very sincerely
and respectfully,

2325
02:38:46,440 --> 02:38:49,310
eorge C. Marshall,
General, Chief Of Staff.

2326
02:39:40,630 --> 02:39:43,930
My family
is with me today.

2327
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:45,860
They wanted
to come with me.

2328
02:39:48,470 --> 02:39:50,100
To be honest
with you,

2329
02:39:50,210 --> 02:39:52,470
I-- I wasn´t sure
how I´d feel

2330
02:39:52,540 --> 02:39:53,740
coming back here.

2331
02:39:56,510 --> 02:40:00,040
Every day I think about
what you said to me

2332
02:40:00,120 --> 02:40:01,880
that day on the bridge.

2333
02:40:03,350 --> 02:40:05,620
And I´ve tried
to live my life

2334
02:40:05,650 --> 02:40:07,490
the best I could.

2335
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:10,620
I hope
that was enough.

2336
02:40:11,760 --> 02:40:14,660
I hope that,
at least in your eyes...

2337
02:40:16,370 --> 02:40:18,300
I´ve earned
what all of you

2338
02:40:18,370 --> 02:40:20,160
have done for me.

2339
02:40:33,580 --> 02:40:34,910
James.

2340
02:40:37,250 --> 02:40:39,380
"Captain
John H. Miller."

2341
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:50,630
Tell me I´ve led
a good life.

2342
02:40:50,700 --> 02:40:51,790
What?

2343
02:40:53,040 --> 02:40:55,700
Tell me I´m a good man.

2344
02:41:02,540 --> 02:41:04,170
You are.
