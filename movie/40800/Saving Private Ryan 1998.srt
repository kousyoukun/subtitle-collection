3
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:07,020
拯救大兵瑞恩

4
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,460
爸爸
Dad?

5
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:41,660
（1944年6月6日）

6
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:46,500
（奧馬哈海灘，綠D區）

7
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,780
別擋住跳板，三十秒後登陸，願主保佑你
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds! May God be with you!

8
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:40,320
左舷右舷聽著，儘快攻佔炮臺
Port side and starboard side stick!Move fast and clear those mortar holes!

9
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:43,290
大家儘量分散
I want to see plenty of beach between men.

10
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:47,320
五個人就容易成為目標，一個人則能躲開
Five men is a juicy opportunity. One man is a waste of ammo.

11
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:51,740
別讓沙子堵塞槍口，小心行事
Keep the sand out of your weapons! Keep those actions clear!

12
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,680
在灘頭上見
I'll see you on the beach!

13
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,980
避開彈坑，分成左右兩列
Clear the mortar hole! Right and left!

14
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:46,320
到旁邊去
Over the side!

15
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,790
從左右方下水
Port and starboard!

16
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,970
謝謝
Thank yo...

17
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
長官，怎麼辦
What now, sir?

18
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,870
長官，現在怎麼辦
I said, What the hell do we do now, sir?

19
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:35,040
米勒上尉
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

20
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,680
米勒上尉     霍瓦特中士
- Captain Miller!   - Sergeant Horvath!

21
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,330
叫你的弟兄攻上灘頭，快
Move your men off the beach! Now!

22
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:48,190
大家聽我命令，跟著我沖
Okay, you guys, get on my ass! Follow me!

23
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,430
長官，集合點在哪裡     總之不是這裡
- Sir! What's the rallying point?    - Anywhere but here!

24
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,080
怎麼辦，長官     快攻上海堤
- What now, sir?   - The seawall, move up to the seawall!

25
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,450
我要留下來     先攻佔灘頭再說
- Sir, I'm staying!   - Clear the beach to make way.

26
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,250
走出去就死定了
This is all we've got between us and the Almighty.

27
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:21,360
這灘頭的每一處都被瞄準了
Every inch of this beach has been pre-sighted.

28
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,330
留下來必死無疑
You stay here, you're dead men!

29
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,540
媽媽
Mama, Mama!

30
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,780
伏下來
Stay down, stay down!

31
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,320
你們是什麼部隊     104師的醫療營
- What are you guys?   - 104th Medical Battalion,sir.

32
00:11:57,530 --> 00:12:01,660
我們是來設立醫療站的     丟掉這廢物
- We're here to set up field operations.   - Get rid of that crap!

33
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,170
拿起武器跟我來
Grab yourselves some weapons and follow me.

34
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,680
我中彈了     布格斯
- I'm hit!   - Briggs!

35
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,750
醫護兵

36
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,360
天啊，我中彈了     醫護兵
- I'm hit low! God!   - Medic!

37
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,090
我們是海軍搶灘大隊
Navy Beach Battalion, sir!

38
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,990
我得清除這些障礙給坦克開路
I've got to clear these obstacles. Make holes for the tanks!

39
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,170
裝甲車都掉到海裡了     長官，這是命令
- All the armour is floundering at sea.   - Orders, sir!

40
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,740
到別處去，這裡交給我
Go somewhere else! I'm clearing this one.

41
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,170
來吧，布格斯
Come on, Briggs!

42
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,910
醫護兵
Medic!

47
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,090
海岸後勤工作隊裝甲車都無法登岸
Shore party! No armour has made it ashore.

48
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:04,060
灘頭上都沒有DD坦克，D1缺口還沒打開
We've got no DD tanks on the beach.Dog One is not open!

49
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,220
這裡是誰指揮
Who's in command here?

50
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,230
長官，是你
You are, sir!

51
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:14,760
霍瓦特中士，你認得這是哪裡嗎
Sergeant Horvath? Do you recognize where we are?

52
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,170
是原定的集合點，但卻沒有支援部隊
Where we're supposed to be, but no one else is.

53
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:20,710
大家都走散了
Nobody's where they're supposed to be!

54
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,110
海岸後勤工作隊
Shore party!

55
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:26,650
第一波攻擊無效，無法攻佔海灘
First wave ineffective! We do not hold the beach.

56
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:29,910
重複，無法攻佔海灘
Say again, we do not hold the beach!

57
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:35,250
我們都混在一起了，這裡有F、A和G連的弟兄
We're mixed up! We've got people from Fox,Able and George companies.

58
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,950
和海軍爆破隊員及陸戰隊長
Plus, we got some Navy demo guys and a beachmaster.

59
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,690
海岸後勤工作隊
Shore party, Shore party!

60
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,370
指揮官
CAT-F, CAT-F, CA...

61
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,800
萊賓報到     有看到別人嗎
- Reiben here.   - Seen anybody else?

62
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:00,510
只有傑克森     梅利西報到
- Jackson,but that's it.   - Mellish here!

63
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,810
卡帕佐，德佛裡斯特和韋德在後面
Caparzo! We've got DeForest back there with Wade!

64
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:09,550
他嚴重失血，韋德說他沒救了
D.'s hurt so bad he's sprung a hundred leaks! Wade says he's used up!

65
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,750
去救其他人吧     我們走吧，他是軍醫
- Move on to somebody you can help.   - Let go, he's a battalion surgeon!

66
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:21,130
去叫他     韋德
- Get his attention!   - Wade!

67
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,170
韋德     韋德
- Wade!   - Wade!

68
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:28,780
韋德，別這麼做，太危險了
Wade, don't do it! It's too risky, too risky, Doc!

69
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:31,170
快滾回來
Get your ass back here!

70
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,180
把他帶回來
Get him off the beach.

71
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:37,010
我辦到了，我們替他止住血了
I've got it! We've stopped the bleeding!

72
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,620
他媽的
Fuck!

73
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:43,450
混蛋，趕盡殺絕
Just give us a fucking chance, you son of a bitch!

74
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,090
韋德，走吧     你這個混蛋
- Wade, come on!   - You son of a fucking cocksucker!

75
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:50,100
韋德，是梅利西，韋德
Wade, it's Mellish. Wade!

76
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,270
走吧，找到米勒了，走吧
Let's move! We found Miller! Let's move!

77
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,960
他媽的
Fuck it!

78
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:57,660
伏下
Get down, get down!

79
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,670
就只有你們幾個嗎
This is all? This is all that's made it?

80
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,110
我們被分散了，一定還有人的
We got scattered pretty bad. There's bound to be more of us.

81
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,810
這樣不夠
It's not enough.

82
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:15,080
D1缺口是在右邊還是左邊
Dog One exit. It's the cut to the right, or was it left?

83
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,420
不，維爾維裡在左邊，這裡才是D1缺口
No. Vierville is to the left. This is Dog One.

84
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:25,090
他們在痛宰我們，根本沒有機會戰鬥，不公平
They're killing us and we don't have a fucking chance! That ain't fair!

85
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,570
收集武器彈藥     收集武器彈藥
- Gather weapons and ammo!   - Gather weapons and ammo!

86
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,510
萊賓，你的手槍呢
Reiben! Where's your BAR?

87
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,190
在水底，差點給敵軍害我被淹死
Bottom of the Channel. The bitch tried to drown me.

88
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:49,220
再去找一支
Find a replacement.

89
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:54,360
拿爆破筒出來
Bangalores! Bring out some bangalores!

90
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,370
工兵來了     給我手榴彈
- Engineers coming!   - Grenades, give me grenades!

91
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:06,000
把爆破筒運到前面去
Bangalores up the line! Bangalores up the line!

92
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:10,870
小心，爆破筒來了，來吧
Heads up! Bangers coming your way! Come on, come on!

93
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,310
傑克森報到     萊賓回來了
- Jackson here, sir!   - Reiben back, sir.

94
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,850
天啊
Oh, my God!

95
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,450
迫擊炮來了
Mortars incoming!

96
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,990
再給我一支
One more, give me one more!

97
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,990
天啊，痛死我了，我快要死了
Oh, my God, it hurts! I'm going to die!

98
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,500
天啊
Oh, my God! Jesus! Oh, my God!

99
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,540
放進去，繼續
Come on, put it in. Keep it moving.

100
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,400
行了
We've got it.

101
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,440
天啊，這混蛋真幸運
Jesus! Lucky bastard.

102
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:45,640
快點
Move it! Keep it moving!

103
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:54,550
你不會死的，別看，沒事的
You're not going to die. You're fine. Just don't look at it. Don't look at it!

104
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:58,450
用爆破筒來攻擊，讓開
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

105
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,100
對準沙坑     對準沙坑
- Fire in the hole!   - Fire in the hole!

106
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,130
對準沙坑
Fire in the hole!

107
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:07,030
對準沙坑
Fire in the hole!

108
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:20,110
可以反攻了，找掩護，到沙坑的另一邊
We're in business! Defilade! Other side of the hole!

109
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,190
給他注射嗎啡
Give him some morphine.

110
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,260
好了，走吧
That's it, let's go.

111
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,270
檢驗過了，注射嗎啡
Inspected, morphine.

112
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:45,860
一般處理
Routine.

113
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:53,180
優先處理
Priority.

114
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
他死了
He is gone

115
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:14,460
混蛋，過去
Son of a bitch! Get in there.

116
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,700
可惡，我動不了     梅利西，刺刀給我
- Fuck,I can't move!   - Mellish,give me your bayonet.

117
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,970
中士
Sarge.

118
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,120
兩挺MG-42機槍，兩支迫擊炮
Two MG-42s, two mortars.

119
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,190
在前方20碼，左邊30碼
Add 20, left 30.

120
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:50,340
那有掩護物，若裝甲車登陸後會是最好的發射位置
There's defilade, but it's a good firing position if we can land the armour.

121
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:53,510
我們得打開這個缺口
We've got to get this draw open!

122
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:58,670
萊賓、梅利西，上吧，找到掩護就猛烈開火
Reiben, Mellish! Let's get in the war! Take cover and put fire on that crew.

123
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:03,080
大衛斯、德伯納多、楊、瓦克，快準備
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk! Get ready!

124
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:06,220
開火
Covering fire!

125
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,020
去吧
Go, go, go!

126
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,570
敵軍的炮火很厲害
It's a goddam firing squad.

127
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,580
要逃出這裡，只有這樣
It's the only way we can get everybody out of here.

128
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:35,050
肖特、佩森、麥唐納、帕克斯，你們是下一組
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes! You're next!

129
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,650
為什麼不乾脆給我們眼罩不就行了嗎
Why not just hand out blindfolds, Captain?

130
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:42,090
只能出去拼命，開火
All we can do here is die! Covering fire!

131
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,660
快
Go, go, go!

132
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:50,390
快點     上，該死
- Come on, come on, come on!  - Go, God damm it!

133
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:05,380
傑克森     是，長官
- Jackson.   - Sir.

134
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,610
看見那彈坑嗎，在那裡應該能躲開機槍的攻擊
See that impact crater? should give you defilade from the machine gun position.

135
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,880
躲進去好好表現槍法，等我的命令
Get in there and give me some fire discipline. Wait for my command.

136
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,360
去吧
Go!

137
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,110
若你媽看見你這樣會很擔憂的
If your mother saw you do that, she'd be very upset.

138
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,010
我還以為你就是我媽呢
I thought you were my mother.

139
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,880
別遠離我，上帝
Be not Thou far from me, O Lord.

140
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:51,750
主啊，很抱歉我曾經激怒你
Oh, my God. I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee.

141
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:56,730
我對此深感懊悔，請聽我的禱告
I detest my sins for having offended Thee, O Lord. Listen to me, Lord.

142
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:07,070
賜我力量，助我抗敵
All my strength! Haste Thee to help me.

143
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,830
D1缺口打開了，往這邊走
Dog One exit, right here!

144
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,520
大家反攻
We're in business!

145
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:31,060
快
Move, move!

146
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,630
萊賓     去吧，中士
- Reiben.   - Go, Sarge!

147
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,470
萊賓
Reiben!

148
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,870
來吧，多裡
Come on, Doyle!

149
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,070
中士
Sarge!

150
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,940
多裡，打開噴火器
Flame! Doyle, do it!

151
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,080
別開槍，讓他們吃吃苦頭
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

152
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,700
右邊
On the right!

153
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,550
你們一起死吧，混蛋
I'll give you "comrade", you son of a bitch!

154
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,590
小心，轉過去
Look out! Turn around, turn around.

155
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,800
去幹掉他們
Flush them out!

156
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,850
停火，住手
Cease fire, cease fire! Cut it out, cut it out!

157
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,490
停火
Cease fire!

158
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:10,220
這是SC第3隊，重複，D1缺口已經打開
Sugar Cane, Sugar Charlie Three. Say again, Dog One is open.

159
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,920
派出推土機，我在這裡等待配合側翼
Send in the dozers. I'm waiting here to tie in my flanks.

160
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,530
什麼
What?

161
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:23,870
什麼，抱歉，我聽不懂你在說什麼
What? I'm sorry, I can't understand what you're saying!

162
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,370
他說什麼
What did he say, what did he say?

163
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,550
我洗過手準備吃飯了
Look, I washed for supper!

164
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:42,210
誰有火箭筒，真該死
Who's got a bazooka,Goddammit

165
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:53,430
笨蛋，你看，是希特勒青年團小刀
Hey, Fish. Look at this, a Hitler Youth knife.

166
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:57,830
現在是猶太麵包刀了，對吧
And now it's a Shabbat challah cutter, right?

167
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:09,950
別停下來
Keep it moving!

168
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,500
（義大利、法國、非洲）

169
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:12,130
好慘烈的景象
That's quite a view.

170
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,800
沒錯
Yes, it is.

171
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,080
很慘烈
Quite a view.

172
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:33,290
（瑞恩）

173
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:57,480
“親愛的博伊德先生，你應該已經得悉”
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd. No doubt by now you have received full information"

174
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:59,100
“你兒子的死訊”
"about the untimely death of your son."

175
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,850
“說什麼也無法減輕您的哀痛”
"No words can ever relieve your grief."

176
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,650
“本部隊對他的死深感惋惜，他是個優秀的士兵”
"Our outfiit has felt his loss greatly... He was a fiine soldier"

177
00:29:04,930 --> 00:29:07,900
“並深信我們所從事的”
"and believed strongly in what we were doing..."

178
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:11,070
“我們參與了大戰中最重要的軍事行動”
"We were involved in one of the most important operations of the war."

179
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,760
“艾爾使我們能團結一致”
"Al was the one who held us all together."

180
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,560
“他身先士卒”
"He was the first to volunteer."

181
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:18,790
“那裡有四千人的部隊開過”
"We passed a road where over 4,000 troops had passed."

182
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
“尊夫盡忠職守”
"Your husband served in a unit whose duty is to place itself beyond..."

183
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:27,080
“大家都很懷念他”
"...which we all cherish and hold dear..."

184
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:30,880
“李等人的死對軍團打擊甚大”
"The loss of Lee and others like him is a distinct blow to the regiment."

185
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,990
“我們瞭解你想知道”
"We understand your desire to learn about"

186
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,170
“他去世時的情形”
"the circumstances leading to his death."

187
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,380
上校，有件事想告訴你
Colonel, I've got something you should know about.

188
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:37,470
這兩人在諾曼第陣亡
These two men died in Normandy.

189
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:41,780
這位死于奧哈馬海灘     肖恩·瑞恩
- This one at Omaha Beach.   - "Sean Ryan."

190
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:46,990
這位死於猶他     彼得·瑞恩
- This man at Utah.   - "Peter Ryan."

191
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:53,950
這位上周在新幾內亞陣亡
This man was killed last week in New Guinea.

192
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,470
丹尼爾·瑞恩
"Daniel Ryan."

193
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,080
他們是兄弟
The three men're brothers,sir.

194
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:07,340
他們的媽媽會在下午接到這三封電報
I just learned that this afternoon their mother's going to get all three telegrams.

195
00:31:10,450 --> 00:31:14,710
在搶灘前一晚他們的四弟跟隨101空降師
There's also a fourth brother who parachuted in with 101st Airborne

196
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:18,220
在諾曼第某處跳傘
the night before the invasion. He is somewhere in Normandy.

197
00:31:18,430 --> 00:31:20,790
他還活著嗎     不知道
- Is he alive?   - We don't know.

198
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,630
跟我來
Come with me.

199
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,130
該死
Goddammit.

200
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,790
四兄弟都在第29師的同一個連隊服役
All four were in the same company in the 29th Division

201
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,040
（陸軍參謀長馬歇爾上將）

202
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,660
但蘇利文兄弟在朱諾送命後我們便分開了他們
but we split them up after the Sullivan brothers died on the Juneau.

203
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:23,040
能聯絡上四弟詹姆斯嗎
Any contact with the fourth son, James?

204
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,580
不能，他空降在距紐維15裡的內陸，深入了敵區
No. He was dropped 15 miles inland near Neuville, behind German lines.

205
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:33,850
根本無法知道他空降在哪裡
Mac, there is no way you can know where he was dropped.

206
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:37,990
據報101空降師的人失散了
First report from lke's people at SHAEF said the 101st is scattered.

207
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,320
諾曼第有很多被空投錯誤的部隊
There are misdrops all over Normandy.

208
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:44,790
就算瑞恩能安然降落也無法找到他
Assuming Private Ryan even survived the jump, he could be anywhere.

209
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,090
可能他早已陣亡
In fact, he's probably K.I.A.

210
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:50,790
老實說，若我們派出搜救部隊
And frankly, if we go sending some sort of rescue mission

211
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,840
他們就得穿越德軍固守區
flat hatting throughout German reinforcements along our advance

212
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,940
那一定也會陣亡的
they're going to be K.I.A., too.

213
00:34:19,970 --> 00:34:21,630
這裡有封信
I have a letter here...

214
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:29,530
是很久以前給波士頓的比克斯比太太的信，聽我讀
...written a long time ago to a Mrs Bixby in Boston. So bear with me.

215
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,540
“女士”
"Dear Madam."

216
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:38,870
“我已從麻薩諸塞州上將副官的”
"I have been shown in the files of the War Department a statement"

217
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,850
“戰爭部檔案得悉”
"of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts"

218
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:44,610
“你是五位在沙場上”
'that you are the mother of five..."

219
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,090
“光榮陣亡的戰士的母親”
"...sons who have died gloriously on the field of battle."

220
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:58,160
“我感到我的言辭薄弱無力”
"I feel how weak and fruitless must be any words of mine"

221
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:01,860
“根本無法安撫你的悲傷”
"that would attempt to beguile you from the grief"

222
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:05,340
“也無法彌補你的損失”
"of a loss so overwhelming..."

223
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,240
“但我必須要在此向你致謝”
"...but I can't refrain from tendering the consolation that may be found"

224
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:16,110
“他們是為了拯救國家而死”
"in the thanks of the republic they died to save."

225
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:24,350
“願天主安撫你的喪子之痛”
"May our Heavenly Father assuage the anguish of your bereavement"

226
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,760
“讓你永遠懷念遠去的摯愛”
"and leave you only the cherished memory of the loved and lost"

227
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,670
“神聖的榮耀都歸於你們”
"and the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid such a sacrifice"

228
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:39,500
“因你們為自由付出了重大的代價”
"upon the altar of freedom. Yours very sincerely and respectfully"

229
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,910
“林肯敬上”
"Abraham Lincoln."

230
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:06,180
那孩子還活著，我們要派人去找他
That boy is alive. We are going to send somebody to find him.

231
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,130
然後帶他遠離戰場
And we are going to get him the hell out of there.

232
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:18,440
（奧哈馬海灘，登陸後第三天）

233
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:27,850
後勤官在海灘尋找被炸毀的碉堡
The Quartermaster's up the beach a way. Look for a blown-up bunker.

234
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,290
我是C連的米勒     上尉，請進
- Miller,Charlie Company.   - Go on in,Captain.

235
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:34,490
若六點以前無法卸下坦克的話
If we don't off-load the Shermans by 06:00

236
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:39,570
一整師的部隊就會被困在卡倫坦
we'll have a division stuck at Carentan with its pants around its ankles.

237
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,040
再說明一下
Well, you let me know of it.

238
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:45,510
讓C連死守維爾維裡直到裝甲兵開到
Let Charlie Company hold at Vierville 'til we can get the armour there.

239
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,340
傳令兵
Runner!

240
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,240
原本空降師該打開缺口的
Airborne was supposed to win an open door for us

241
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,050
但他們卻投錯地方
but misdropped

242
00:36:57,260 --> 00:37:00,090
全都失散了，你的情況怎麼樣
and scattered all their sticks into the wind. What's your situation?

243
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:03,350
第四區攻下了
Yes, sir... Sector Four is secure.

244
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:10,490
我們摧毀了這幾處的88毫米炮
We took out towed 88s here, here and here.

245
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,470
敵軍有四部坦克和一些運兵車
They got four Shermans and some deuce-and-a-halves.

246
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,610
這兩處的佈雷區很大
These two minefields are actually one big one.

247
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:20,680
我們到了中心地帶，發現地雷的密度很大
We went up the middle of it, but it turned into a mixed high-density field.

248
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,970
什麼地雷都有，S44型、S42型
A little bit of everything; Sprengmine 44s, Schumne 42s

249
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:29,520
散片型地雷、A-200，連偵測器都無法找到
pot mines, A-200s, the little wooden bastard the detectors don't pick up.

250
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:32,490
這裡埋了T43型大地雷
Here, they placed big mushrooms, Teller mine 43s

251
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:35,250
可能想炸我們的坦克
I guess for our tanks

252
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,730
從這裡到村莊的週邊
from here right up to the edge of the village, right here.

253
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:40,960
已記下位置，通知了工兵
We marked them and called the engineers.

254
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,660
有遇上反抗嗎     沒想像的那麼強
- Resistance?   - We had higher support expectations.

255
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:49,200
有一連沒配大炮的346步兵
There was a company without artillery. Wehrmacht. 346th Infantry.

256
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,540
由卡夫加帕指揮，我們俘虜了23人
Von Lucke Kampfgruppe. We ended up with 23 prisoners.

257
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,210
已交由29師的憲兵處置
We turned them over to MPs from the 29th.

258
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,250
我軍的傷亡呢
What about our casualties?

259
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:08,480
傷亡人數是35死，70人傷
Well, the figure is... We're 35 dead, times two wounded.

260
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:12,650
他們就是不肯放棄那些重炮
They just didn't want to give up those 88s.

261
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:16,460
任務很艱巨，所以才找你
It was a tough assignment. That was why you got it.

262
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,030
是，長官
Yes, sir.

263
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,170
約翰
John...

264
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,380
你又有一項任務了     是，長官
- I've got another one for you.   - Yes, sir.

265
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:28,740
是上級直接交辦的
It's straight from the top.

266
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,360
我希望你和我帶一隊人到紐維去執行公關任務
I wish. You and I are taking a squad to Neuville on a PR mission.

267
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,620
由你帶隊嗎
Oh, are you leading a squad?

268
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:46,090
一位二等兵死了三兄弟，所以能回家
A private in the 101st lost three brothers and he's got a ticket home.

269
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,460
為何要去紐維呢     他們覺得他在那裡
- Why Neuville?   - They think he's there.

270
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:51,570
他是被錯投的空降部隊之一
Part of all those Airborne misdrops.

271
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,870
在戰場中找一名士兵很難
It won't be easy finding one soldier in the middle of this goddam war.

272
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:58,100
就像大海撈針般
Like finding a needle in a stack of needles.

273
00:38:58,310 --> 00:38:59,800
那連上兄弟怎麼辦
What about the company?

274
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:03,140
最好的跟我們，其他的加入B連
We take the pick of the litter, the rest goes to Baker.

275
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,410
天啊，他們奪走了你的連嗎
Jesus Christ! They took away your company?

276
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:11,720
部隊是軍方的，我們唯有遵命
It wasn't mine, it was the Army's. So they told me, anyway.

277
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,720
把萊賓、傑克森、韋德、貝斯裡和卡帕佐找來
Get me Reiben on BAR, Jackson, Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

278
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,950
貝斯裡死了     那找梅利西吧
- Beasley's dead.   - Alright,Mellish then.

279
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,000
有人會法語嗎     據我所知沒有
- Do have a guy who speaks French?   - Not that I know of.

280
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:26,430
塔爾博特呢     今早死了
- What about Talbot?   - This morning.

281
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,700
我要去找個翻譯員
I'm going to try and dig up another interpreter.

282
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:32,930
到灘頭的車輛調度場集合
Assemble at the battalion motor pool on the beach.

283
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:35,580
該怎麼辦     聽著，什麼
- What are we going to do?   - Listen up. What?

284
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,670
我要用大塊乳酪塞進你的屁股
Go home wrapped in the American flag

285
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:39,550
好讓你棺材蓋國旗回家
with a hunk of cheese in your ass.

286
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:42,950
我以為你喜歡塞屁股的     什麼
- I thought you liked it in the ass.   - What?

287
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,550
立正
Attention!

288
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,350
稍息，我要找提摩西厄本下士
As you were. I'm looking for Corporal Timothy Upham.

289
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,550
是，我就是厄本
Yes, I'm Upham.

290
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,920
你會說法語和德語吧     是，長官
- Do you speak French and German?   - Yes, sir.

291
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:55,120
有沒有口音     法語有
- How's your accent?   - Slight one in French.

292
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:57,430
但德語很純正     很好
- My German's clean.   - Very good.

293
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,330
你已被調派給我了，收拾行囊，我們要到紐維去
You've been re-assigned to me. Grab your gear, we're going to Neuville.

294
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:04,980
這是什麼時候更新的     今天早上八點半
- When was this updated?   - As of 8:30 this morning.

295
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,370
這是12SS坦克部隊，還有兩隊人向南推進
This is the 12th SS Panzer. These are the two axes advancing south.

296
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:13,570
紐維有德軍     我知道，下士
- There are Germans in Neuville.   - I understand, Corporal.

297
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:17,450
紐維有很多德軍     有問題嗎
- There are a lot of Germans in Neuville.   - You've got a problem with that?

298
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:21,150
我沒作戰過，只懂繪製地圖和翻譯
Please consider that I've never been in combat. I make maps and translate.

299
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:24,560
我需要會法語和德語的人
I need someone who speaks French and German.

300
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,860
原來的兩位陣亡了     我從新兵訓練後就沒拿過槍
- My two guys were killed.   - I haven't held a weapon since training.

301
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,500
基本訓練時開過槍吧
Did you fire the weapon in Basic training?

302
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:35,140
開過，長官     那去準備一下
- Yes, sir.   - Well, then get your gear.

303
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,710
長官，我能帶
Sir, may I bring...

304
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,140
能帶打字機嗎
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

305
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:52,350
知道了，長官
Yes, sir.

306
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,820
謝謝你
Thank you very much.

307
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,120
那是紀念品嗎     不是
- Is that a souvenir?   - No, sir.

308
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:01,090
慢慢來
Take your time.

309
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,430
下士，凡事都有好的一面
You should look on the bright side of things, Corporal.

310
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:12,800
是的     還有，這個也沒有用
- Yes.   - For one thing, you don't need those.

311
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:17,070
但你需要這個     對，要這個
- You'll need that.   - Yes. I'll need this, not that.

312
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,500
你好     你好
- Hey!   - Hey!

313
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,940
你是不是想找死
You want your head blown off?

314
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,010
別再用你的爪子碰我，回去你的崗位
Don't touch me with those rat claws again. Get the fuck back in formation!

315
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:27,020
我只是想問你來自哪裡
I was just wondering where you're from.

316
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:35,620
卡帕佐，對吧     滾開，下士
- Caparzo,is it?   - Drop dead,Corporal.

317
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,020
知道了
Gotcha.

318
00:42:37,230 --> 00:42:40,860
每次你向上尉敬禮就會惹來德軍襲擊他
Every time you salute the Captain,you make him a target for the Germans.

319
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,970
對不起     幫幫忙，別那麼做
- I'm sorry.   - Do us a favour.Don't do it.

320
00:42:43,170 --> 00:42:45,800
尤其是當我站在他旁邊時，明白嗎
Especially when I'm standing next to him.Capisci?

321
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,100
明白了     下士，那是什麼書
- Capisco.   - Corporal,what's your book about?

322
00:42:49,310 --> 00:42:50,600
當心你的槍     對不起
- Watch your rifle.   - Sorry.

323
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:55,750
是關於行軍時發展手足之情的方法
It's about the brotherhood that develops between soldiers during war.

324
00:42:55,950 --> 00:42:59,580
手足之情，你懂什麼是手足之情
Brotherhood? What do you know about brotherhood?

325
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:01,810
要注意這傢伙
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

326
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:04,580
你為什麼不去問上尉是哪裡人呢
Why don't you ask the Captain where he's from?

327
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:08,190
去問他，他什麼都會告訴你的
Ask the Captain. He'll tell you everything you want to know about him.

328
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:11,630
解釋給我聽
Explain the maths of this to me.

329
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:15,770
八個人為什麼要冒險救一個人呢
Where is the sense in risking the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?

330
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,900
20度，有人想回答這個問題嗎
20 degrees. Anybody wants to answer that?

331
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:22,200
萊賓，想想那可憐蟲的媽媽吧
Reiben, think about the poor bastard's mother.

332
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:24,530
醫護兵，我也有媽媽
Hey, Doc, I've got a mother.

333
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:27,070
你有媽媽，中士也有媽媽
You've got a mother, Sarge has got a mother.

334
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,770
我敢說上尉也有媽媽
Shit, I bet even the Captain's got a mother.

335
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,750
也許上尉沒有，但我們全都有
Maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us.

336
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:36,250
“不問原因，只求為國犧牲”
"Their's is not to reason why their's is but to do and die"

337
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:40,750
下士，那是什麼意思
What the fuck is that supposed to mean, Corporal?

338
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,290
我們都該死嗎
We're all supposed to die?

339
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:46,160
厄本說的是我們的職責     是，長官
- Upham's talking about our duty.   - Yes, sir.

340
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:47,390
我們全都得服從命令
We all have orders to follow.

341
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:54,700
是的，長官，謝謝    就算任務是“苦差”也要嗎
Yes, sir. Thank you. Even if the mission is "FUBAR"?

342
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:57,400
這才更加要服從
Especially if the mission is "FUBAR".

343
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:01,810
“苦差”是什麼     那是德語
- What's "FUBAR"?   - It's German.

344
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,140
沒聽過
Never heard of that...

345
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,480
長官，我對此有點意見
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

346
00:44:08,690 --> 00:44:11,380
說出來聽聽吧
By all means, share it with the squad.

347
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,820
我的想法是
From my way of thinking

348
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:18,790
這次任務浪費了寶貴的軍事資源
this mission is a misallocation of valuable military resources.

349
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,830
是嗎，繼續
Yeah? Go on.

350
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:26,630
我覺得上帝賜給我打仗的天分
It seems to me that God gave me a sepcial gift made me a fine instrument of warfare.

351
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:30,670
萊賓，聽好，這樣抱怨才對，繼續，傑克森
Reiben,pay attention.Now, this is the way to gripe.Continue,Jackson.

352
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,310
要是他派我這個狙擊手
If He was to put me and this sniper rifle anywhere up to and including

353
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:39,710
到希特勒一裡範圍內
one mile of Adolf Hitler with a clear line of sight, sir...

354
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,150
大家就能收拾行囊回家，戰爭就結束了，阿門
Pack your bags, fellas, the war is over. Amen.

355
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,580
鄉巴佬，這主意不錯
That's brilliant, bumpkin.

356
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:48,620
上尉，你呢，你不會抱怨嗎
What about you, Captain? You don't gripe at all?

357
00:44:48,830 --> 00:44:52,090
我是上尉，身負重任，不會向你抱怨
I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain. There's a chain of command.

358
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:54,090
上級永遠是發牢騷的物件
Gripe always go up.

359
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:59,100
你向我發牢騷，我向我上級發牢騷，如此類推
You gripe to me, I gripe to my superior officers, and so on.

360
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:03,170
我不會在你面前發牢騷，你是突擊隊員，應該明白
I don't gripe in front of you. You should know that as a Ranger.

361
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:08,040
對不起，就當你不是上尉或我是少校吧
I'm sorry, but let's say that you weren't a captain or that I was a major.

362
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:09,980
你會說什麼
What would you say?

363
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:14,080
那樣我就會說，這項任務棒極了
In that case, I'd say, "This is an excellent mission"

364
00:45:14,290 --> 00:45:18,720
意義重大，值得我全力以赴
"with a valuable objective worthy of my best efforts."

365
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:24,490
而且我對瑞恩的母親感到深切的悲痛
"Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow for the mother of Private Ryan"

366
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:29,960
為了慰藉她，我願意賠上我與部下的性命
"and I'll lay down my life and those of my men, especially yours, Reiben"

367
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,660
尤其是你，萊賓
"to ease her suffering."

368
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,400
他很棒     我喜歡他
- He's good.   - I love him.

369
00:45:45,850 --> 00:45:47,650
算了
Fine!

370
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:32,020
打雷     閃電
- Thunder!   - Flash!

371
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:36,030
厄本，到那邊去，萊賓，你們四個過去
Upham, over there. Reiben, you four go.

372
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:46,810
去吧
Go, go, go, go!

373
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:55,320
很高興看見你     希爾中士，救星來了
- You are a sight for sore eyes.   - Sergeant Hill, our reliefs showed up.

374
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:59,620
有多少人     八個，但不是救兵
- How many are you?   - Eight. We're not your relief.

375
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:03,090
為什麼     我們來找二等兵瑞恩
- What do you mean, sir?   - We're here for a Private Ryan.

376
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,730
誰     瑞恩，為什麼
- Who?   - Ryan? What for?

377
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,230
他在這裡嗎     大概在鎮的另一邊
- Is he here?   - Maybe on the other side of the town.

378
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,930
周圍都有德軍，很難通過
It's hard to get to. The Germans punched a hole in our centre.

379
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:15,070
我軍給德軍切斷，他叫什麼名字
- They cut us right in two.   - What's his name,again?

380
00:47:15,270 --> 00:47:18,370
瑞恩，詹姆斯·瑞恩，隸屬101空降師
Ryan, James Ryan. He dropped in with the 101st.

381
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:21,600
高德曼，找傳令兵來     傳令兵
- Goldman, get me a runner!   - Runner!

382
00:47:21,810 --> 00:47:23,710
來吧
Come on!

383
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,820
鐘斯，讓開
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

384
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,420
我們被東面的炮火所阻
We got stopped by fire from the eastward.

385
00:47:34,630 --> 00:47:38,250
德軍聚集了兩個團的兵力
The Germans have been reinforcing two regiments all day.

386
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:40,520
已經有四十五分鐘沒有動靜
It's been quiet for 45 minutes.

387
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,170
德軍正把火力集中於西面
The Germans concentrate their fire westward.

388
00:47:43,370 --> 00:47:46,670
誰在廣播     達伍德·迪·撒多夫
- Who's that on the loudspeaker?   - Dagwood Duesseldorf.

389
00:47:46,870 --> 00:47:51,370
他在替德軍激勵士氣
Our friendly neighbourhood morale officer.

390
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:54,840
“自由神像完蛋了”
"The Statue of Liberty is kaput."

391
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,410
想擾亂我們軍心
That's disconcerting.

392
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:06,120
笨蛋，你父親的包皮已被割掉了
Your father was circumcised by my rabbi, you prick!

393
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,980
開槍掩護
Cover!

394
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,600
去吧
Go!

395
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:45,460
去你的臭混蛋     伏下
- You sadistic fucking animals!   - Get down.

396
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,530
敵人知道我軍通訊中斷，所以針對傳令兵
They know we're not in direct contact. They'll single out the runners.

397
00:48:48,730 --> 00:48:50,290
為什麼要射殺他們
Why do they shoot them up?

398
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:54,060
不能留活口，以防軍情外泄，我們也會這樣做
As long as his lungs are working, he carries the message. We'd do the same.

399
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:57,800
不，我們不會     韋德，準備起程
- No, we wouldn't!   - Wade! Get them ready to travel.

400
00:48:58,010 --> 00:48:59,840
博伊德     來吧
- Boyd!   - Come on!

401
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:02,710
再試一遍，設法通知漢米爾上尉我們正趕過去
Try again! Let Captain Hamill know we're coming.

402
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:05,180
紐維其他地方怎麼樣
What's the rest of Neuville like?

403
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,180
接著會看到兩層建築物，有很多窗戶
The next block's got two-storey buildings. A lot of windows.

404
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:11,450
有一廣場可作藏身之用
There's a square with good cover.

405
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:14,060
帶我去，中士，留在這裡
Show me. Sarge, hold right here!

406
00:49:14,260 --> 00:49:15,690
是，長官
Yes, sir!

407
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,490
別在這裡挨打，到裡面躲避
Stay out of this enfilade and use the buildings.

408
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:25,640
到左邊去，邊走邊射擊，我們各派兩人
Try a left hook. Shoot and scoot. Two of yours, two of mine.

409
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,330
黑斯亭斯、高德曼，到前面去
Hastings, Goldman! Up front!

410
00:49:29,470 --> 00:49:32,140
萊賓、卡帕佐     通訊仍受敵軍干擾
- Reiben, Caparzo.   - They're still jamming us.

411
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:35,400
儘快到角落去，小心行事
Short runs, high and low at the corners. It's going to be tight.

412
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,980
準備進行近身戰，去吧
Be prepared for close contact. Go.

413
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:40,650
厄本，跟霍瓦特中士待在一起
Upham! You stay with Sergeant Horvath.

414
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:44,880
上尉，我會像內褲般粘著他
Stay here! I'll wear him like underwear, Captain. You stay with me.

415
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,970
廣場閘口在大樓的盡頭
Past the end of the block are the gates of the square.

416
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:58,140
好     好的
- Good.   - Alright.

417
00:50:05,510 --> 00:50:07,240
萊賓，上尉從哪裡來的
Reiben, where's the Captain from?

418
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:11,180
猜中的話有獎     獎金三百塊
- If you figure it out, you'll get a prize.   - 300 bucks, last I heard.

419
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,870
大家下注，最少五塊
The company's got a pool. Five bucks gets you in.

420
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:25,450
就在拐彎處，躲到閘門後面去
It's around this corner. Defilade right up to those gates.

421
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,300
一定有人知道他來自哪裡
Somebody must know where he's from.

422
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,470
我跟他一起那麼久也毫無頭緒
I've been with him since Casserene Pass. I don't have a clue.

423
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:37,510
我的腳踝很痛，戰爭沒結束已經要坐輪椅
My ankles are killing me. I'll need a wheelchair before the war is over.

424
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:41,970
老天，就跟老婦一樣
That's it! Oh, my God! That ankle is like an old woman.

425
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:45,550
就像，老天
Like an old... Oh, God!

426
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:50,080
萊賓，你連他上哪所學校也不知道嗎
Reiben. So you don't even know where he went to school?

427
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:54,520
他沒念書，是軍部用大兵屍體組裝而成
He didn't go to school. They assembled him at OCS out of dead Gls.

428
00:50:54,730 --> 00:50:58,060
我知道他的來歷
Pay attention to detail. I know where he's from and what he did

429
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:00,360
因為我看得仔細
because I pay attention to detail.

430
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:03,830
厄本，別信他的鬼話
Hey, Upham! Careful you don't step in the bullshit.

431
00:51:09,370 --> 00:51:11,640
說吧     打雷
- Do it.   - Thunder!

432
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,370
打雷，不然開火
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

433
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:17,570
梅利西、卡帕佐，過來
Mellish, Caparzo, come here!

434
00:51:24,390 --> 00:51:27,220
叫他們表明身分
Tell them to show themselves.

435
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:41,800
問問德軍在哪裡
Ask them where the Germans are.

436
00:51:46,340 --> 00:51:48,510
他說什麼     關於孩子的
- What is he saying?   - Something about the children.

437
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,870
孩子     他想我們帶走孩子
- Kids?   - He wants us to take them.

438
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,810
不行，不能帶走孩子
No, no. We can't take the kids.

439
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:58,510
不可以，不行
We can't take the kids! No, no!

440
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:03,690
他們以為這樣較安全     才不會
- They think they'll be safe.   - They won't be safe with us!

441
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,660
你瘋了嗎，聽從上尉的命令
Are you nuts? Listen to the Captain!

442
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:10,170
他們以為孩子會安全一點
They think they'll be safe with us.

443
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:15,810
什麼地方也不會安全，卡帕佐，交回孩子
It's not safe anywhere. Caparzo! Put that kid back!

444
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,510
卡帕佐，把孩子還給他們     請放心
- Caparzo, put the girl back!   - It's OK, it's OK.

445
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,870
交回孩子
Give that kid back!

446
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:27,780
厄本，怎麼說請放心     她讓我想起外甥女
- Upham, how do you say, "It's OK?" I can't.   - She reminds me of my niece.

447
00:52:27,990 --> 00:52:29,920
把孩子交回去
Get the kid back up there!

448
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:33,520
最少也該把她帶到下個市鎮
We should at least take her to the next town.

449
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:36,820
我們有任務在身，不是來救孩子
We're not here to do that, we're here to follow orders!

450
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:40,160
中士，把孩子接過來
Sarge, take this goddam kid!

451
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,030
躲好
Cover, cover!

452
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:51,740
糟糕
No!

453
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,840
可惡，哪裡射過來的
Goddammit! Where did that come from?

454
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:59,610
聽到槍聲前他已倒地
He was on the ground before we heard the shot.

455
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:06,860
是我就會到那裡
That's where I'd be.

456
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,590
我看不到     450碼外，也許在陰暗處
- I didn't see it.   - 450 yards, maybe a shade under.

457
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,560
大家別冒險出去，那槍手槍法很厲害
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas. This sniper's got talent!

458
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:26,110
別哭，我帶你找爸媽
Please don't cry. I'll take you back to Mama and Papa. Please don't cry.

459
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:27,610
來吧
Come on.

460
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,510
卡帕佐
Carpy!

461
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:45,900
上尉     撐著，卡帕佐
- Captain!   - Hold on, Caparzo.

462
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,830
扶我起來，我可以走路
Help me up. I can walk.

463
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,660
卡帕佐，別動
Caparzo, stay still!

464
00:54:02,550 --> 00:54:05,410
兩格，風向偏左
Two clicks. Left wind.

465
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,450
笨蛋
Fish!

466
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:20,360
上尉，看到他嗎，他怎麼了
Captain, can you see him? How is he?

467
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:22,660
韋德，別亂來
Wade, you stay put.

468
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:25,030
上尉，他哪裡中槍
Where is he shot, Captain?

469
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:29,100
看得到他嗎     別出去
- Can you see him?   - You stay there!

470
00:54:29,310 --> 00:54:31,670
可惡，躺下來
Damn it! Stay down!

471
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:36,510
你怎麼了，你中了槍要我照顧嗎
What's the matter with you? Am I going to take care of you if you get hit?

472
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,540
笨蛋，過來
Fish, come over here!

473
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:42,340
卡帕佐，躺下來別動
Carpy, put your head down! Why can't you put your head down?

474
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:54,060
神啊，我信靠你
Oh, my God, I trust in Thee.

475
00:54:54,270 --> 00:55:00,070
別讓我蒙羞，別讓敵人戰勝我
Let me not be ashamed. Let not my enemies triumph over me.

476
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,550
抄下來，替我寄出去
Copy it. Copy it and send it for me.

477
00:55:13,750 --> 00:55:16,300
放下來，你自己寄
You're going to send it yourself. Put it down!

478
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,490
信沾了血     我知道
- It's got blood on it!   - I see it.

479
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:27,990
給我爸的，沾了血，笨蛋
It's... It's to my dad. It's got blood on it, Fish.

480
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,760
打中了，伏下
We got him. Stay down.

481
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,040
傷得很重嗎     胸口中彈，或許肺被打中了
- How bad is it?   - Chest, maybe lung shot.

482
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,720
把那台30毫米大炮放到街上
Get that.30 up the street!

483
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:37,060
報告情況     上面安全
- Detail!   - Clear, up!

484
00:56:37,270 --> 00:56:38,830
下面安全
Clear, down!

485
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,310
早就說過不能帶孩子
That's why we can't take children.

486
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:06,130
霍瓦特中士，檢查武器
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

487
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:09,810
厄本，把水壺裝滿
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

488
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,320
希爾中士     是的，長官
- Sergeant Hill.   - Yes, sir.

489
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:16,730
召集弟兄，在廣場西北角集合
Gather your men. We'll form up at the northwest corner of the square.

490
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,500
傑克森     是，長官
- Jackson.   - Sir!

491
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:23,830
梅利西，去檢查那座塔，儘快回來，快去吧
Mellish. Check the tower, hustle back here. Right now, go!

492
00:57:35,190 --> 00:57:37,090
該死的瑞恩
Fuck Ryan!

493
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,630
打雷     閃電，進來吧
- Thunder!    - Flash! Come on in!

494
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,500
我們在找漢米爾上尉
Hey, guys. We're looking for Captain Hamill.

495
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,500
那邊，過了廣場就到     過了廣場
- Down there, across the square.   - Across the square.

496
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:03,870
慢慢走，提防狙擊手
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

497
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,080
請坐
Sit down.

498
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:25,890
吉米，叫漢米爾上尉過來
Jimmy T. Go and find Captain Hamill. Bring him here.

499
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,060
什麼，上面嗎     我怎麼知道，自己去找
- What? Up there?   - How should I know? Go and look!

500
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:32,030
謝謝你，混蛋
Thank you, you moron.

501
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:38,800
先在這裡休息一下
Alright. You guys just flake out here for a while.

502
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,090
我要把石子倒出來
Let me get this goddam hitchhiker out of my boot.

503
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:58,060
放下武器     立刻放下
- Put your weapons down!   - Drop them now!

504
00:59:02,150 --> 00:59:03,930
我會開槍的
I'll shoot you!

505
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,540
放下武器
Drop, drop 'em!

506
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:10,440
立刻放下武器
Put 'em down!

507
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,650
上面安全了
Clear, up!

508
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:35,230
該死
Shit, shit!

509
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,730
上面安全了
Clear, up!

510
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:39,880
下面也安全了
Clear, down!

511
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,250
這樣子夠讓人變老了
Enough to make you old.

512
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,820
但願如此
Let's hope so.

513
01:00:05,970 --> 01:00:09,770
101師前導部隊的漢米爾     第二突擊隊的米勒
- Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.   - Miller, 2nd Rangers.

514
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:12,500
謝謝
Thank you.

515
01:00:12,710 --> 01:00:15,170
我們在找二等兵瑞恩，他是你的屬下
We're looking for a Private Ryan. He's part of your outfit.

516
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,400
有可能找到他嗎
Any chance that you policed him up?

517
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:22,950
路上的情況怎麼樣     景色優美，彈藥快用光了
- How was the road in?   - Scenic. We lost most of our ammo.

518
01:00:23,150 --> 01:00:25,120
還死了一位隊員
Not to mention one of our men.

519
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:29,590
中尉，把火箭筒調換到右邊的路旁
Lieutenant! Redeploy that bazooka to the right side of the road.

520
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,020
去找瑞恩過來
And get Ryan up here!

521
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,760
瑞恩，到前面來
Ryan! Ryan! Front and centre! Ryan!

522
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,700
那傢伙來了
Here comes our boy.

523
01:00:51,950 --> 01:00:53,970
我早說他是個混蛋
I told you he was an asshole.

524
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,710
二等兵瑞恩報到     稍息
- Private Ryan reporting as ordered.   - At ease.

525
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,690
第二突擊隊的米勒上尉有話跟你說
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers, wants a word with you.

526
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:06,120
這邊來
This way.

527
01:01:06,330 --> 01:01:09,560
請坐下
Alright. Take a knee.

528
01:01:18,610 --> 01:01:20,940
二等兵，有個壞消息要告訴你
Private, I'm afraid I have some bad news for you.

529
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:33,810
這真是讓人難以啟齒
Well, there isn't any really easy way to say this, so...

530
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,090
我就直說吧，你的兄弟死了
...so I'll just say it. Your brothers are dead.

531
01:01:40,390 --> 01:01:45,020
我們奉命來找你
We have orders to come and get you...

532
01:01:45,230 --> 01:01:47,260
因為你可以回家了
...because you're going home.

533
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,470
天啊，我兄弟死了
Oh, my God! My brothers are dead!

534
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:15,260
我本想帶他們去釣魚的
I was going to take them fishing when we got home.

535
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:33,040
對不起，詹姆斯，真是不知該說什麼
I'm so sorry, James. I can't tell you how much.

536
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:38,650
他們是怎樣死的     陣亡
- How did they die?   - They were killed in action.

537
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,850
沒有可能
That can't be.

538
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,130
他們還在念中學
They can't be my brothers. They're still in grammar school.

539
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:54,530
你是詹姆斯·瑞恩嗎     是的
- You're James Ryan?   - Yeah.

540
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:57,830
愛阿華州的詹姆斯·法蘭西斯·瑞恩
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

541
01:02:58,040 --> 01:03:01,440
我是明尼蘇達州的詹姆斯·腓德利克·瑞恩
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

542
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:11,940
那表示我弟弟沒事嗎     對，我確信他們很好
- Does that mean my brothers are OK?   - Yeah,I'm sure they're fine.

543
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:15,090
你能肯定嗎     我們找的不是這個瑞恩
- Are you sure?   - We're looking for a different Ryan.

544
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:16,720
只是一場誤會而已
It's just a big foul-up.

545
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:21,360
你怎麼能確定，怎麼知道是不是又弄錯了
How can you be sure? How do you know that the foul-up isn't

546
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:23,550
原來是他的弟弟沒事，而我
that his brothers are OK, and...

547
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:25,820
中尉     麻煩你了，很抱歉
- Lieutenant.   - I'm sorry for the trouble.

548
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:31,200
我在離開前才剛給他們寫信，我要回家
I just wrote them a letter before I left. I've got to get home.

549
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:36,210
我要立刻回家，我想回家
I've got to get home right now. I want to go home.

550
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,240
我們的瑞恩在哪裡呢     不知道
- Where is our Ryan?   - Don't know.

551
01:03:38,450 --> 01:03:42,470
可以跟指揮官聯絡一下嗎     瑞恩隸屬於什麼單位
- Are you in touch with your CO?   - What unit's Ryan in?

552
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,640
506團的B連     那個斷腳的傢伙是506團的
- Baker Company, 506th.   - The guy with the broken foot's in 506th.

553
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:49,320
我猜是C連吧     你猜
- Charlie, I think.   - You think?

554
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:53,290
瑞恩，我不知道，天啊
Ryan? Don't know... Man!

555
01:03:53,490 --> 01:03:55,960
你們在哪裡降落     維爾維裡
- Where was your dropzone?   - Vierville.

556
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,890
維爾維裡，那怎麼會到這來的
Vierville? How did you end up here?

557
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,190
說來話長，C-47受到猛烈的攻擊
You got me, sir. The C-47 took heavy fire.

558
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,890
機師拼命閃避炮火
Pilot went crazy turning every which way.

559
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:09,240
跳傘時炮火更猛，情況混亂，我就來了這裡
We took more fire in the drop. It got messy. I ended up here.

560
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:12,540
我沒見過我的隊友，天知道他們在哪裡
I haven't seen a single guy from my stick. God knows where they are.

561
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:16,380
有B連的人談到空降區在哪嗎
Did anybody from Baker Company talk about where the dropzone was?

562
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:19,880
沒有，但大家的集合點一樣
No, but they had the same rallying point as us.

563
01:04:20,090 --> 01:04:21,990
指出來
Show me.

564
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:28,350
我們很累，在這裡休息三小時，入夜後出發
My men are beat. We'll hold up here for three hours and pull out after dark.

565
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:31,260
這鎮上有三星級飯店什麼的嗎
Got anything left in this town, like a three-star hotel?

566
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,560
有乾淨的床單、枕頭和客房服務嗎
Something with clean sheets, soft pillows and room service?

567
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:38,170
舒適的教堂怎麼樣     也好
- How about a nice, comfy church?   - We'll take that.

568
01:04:38,410 --> 01:04:41,200
有什麼消息，戰況怎麼樣
What have you heard? How is it all falling together?

569
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,570
我們攻下了灘頭堡，但蒙蒂卻慢條斯理的進軍康城
We got the beachhead secured,but Monty's taking his time moving on Caen.

570
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:49,810
要他準備好我們才能撤軍     大家高估他了
- We can't pull out'til he's ready,so...   - That guy's overrated.

571
01:04:50,020 --> 01:04:53,510
我同意     要拿下康城才能攻下聖羅
- No argument here.   - You take Caen to take Saint-L8.

572
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:57,320
要攻下瓦隆尼先要拿下聖羅     瓦隆尼之後是瑟堡
- You gotta take St-L8 to take Valognes.   - Valognes,you've got Cherbourg.

573
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,960
瑟堡之後是巴黎     最後是柏林
- Cherbourg,you've got Paris.   - Paris,you've got Berlin.

574
01:05:01,190 --> 01:05:03,630
然後就能坐大船回家
And then that big boat home.

575
01:05:06,900 --> 01:05:10,600
你在這裡能幫到我很多，但我瞭解你的任務
I could really use you around here, but I understand what you're doing.

576
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:14,930
是嗎     我也有幾個兄弟
- You do?   - I've got a couple of brothers myself.

577
01:05:15,140 --> 01:05:17,270
原來是這樣     祝你好運
- Oh.   - Good luck.

578
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,970
謝謝     不，我是說真的
- Thank you.   - No, I mean it.

579
01:05:20,180 --> 01:05:23,240
找到他，帶他回家
Find him. Get him home.

580
01:05:31,090 --> 01:05:33,180
你的手怎麼了
What's with your hand?

581
01:05:34,460 --> 01:05:36,760
不知道
I don't know.

582
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,930
在樸資茅斯上船後就是這樣
It started in Portsmouth when we went down for embarkation.

583
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:45,760
偶爾會這樣     你該找別的工作
- It comes and goes.   - You have to find yourself a new job.

584
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:48,600
這工作不適合你了
This one doesn't seem to agree with you any more.

585
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,210
什麼事
What?

586
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:02,450
什麼     沒什麼
- What?   - Nothing.

587
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:05,390
在安濟奧那小子叫什麼名字
What was the name of that kid at Anzio?

588
01:06:05,590 --> 01:06:08,580
用手倒立走路那個
The one who walked on his hands

589
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,560
唱著空中飛人之歌那個嗎
and was singing that song about the man on the flying trapeze?

590
01:06:11,770 --> 01:06:14,560
是維馳奧     維馳奧
- Vecchio.   - Vecchio!

591
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:23,940
對，他是個笨蛋
Yeah, Vecchio. He was a goofy kid.

592
01:06:25,110 --> 01:06:30,410
喜歡在別人的外套上尿出一個“V”字，代表維馳奧
I remember he used to pee a "v" on everybody's jackets. For "vecchio".

593
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:33,550
代表勝利     維馳奧
- For victory.   - Vecchio.

594
01:06:36,290 --> 01:06:39,950
他長得很矮     他是侏儒吧
- He was so short.   - He was a midget, wasn't he?

595
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:43,960
那他怎麼能當上突擊隊隊員的
Yeah, how did he get to be a Ranger?

596
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,760
他的腳被打斷了，所以用手走路
He got shot in the foot once, walking on his hands.

597
01:06:46,970 --> 01:06:50,770
走得很快
He could walk faster on his hands.

598
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:53,840
跑得更加快
He could run faster on his hands.

599
01:06:56,610 --> 01:07:00,270
維馳奧
Vecchio. Yeah.

600
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:04,250
卡帕佐
Caparzo.

601
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:15,690
每當一位弟兄死去
You see, when you end up killing one of your men

602
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:20,600
就要告訴自己，這樣能拯救
you tell yourself it happened so you could save the lives of

603
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:25,030
二、三、四或十條人命
two, three, or ten others.

604
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:28,710
甚至是一百人
Maybe 100 others.

605
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:35,310
你知道我當指揮時有多少部下陣亡嗎
Do you know how many men I've lost under my command?

606
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:37,780
多少     九十四個
- How many?   - 94.

607
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:44,860
但那代表我救了十倍那麼多的人嗎
But that means I've saved the lives of ten times that many, doesn't it?

608
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:49,920
甚至是二十倍
Maybe even 20, right? 20 times as many?

609
01:07:55,340 --> 01:07:58,530
事情就是這麼簡單
And that's how simple it is.

610
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:03,900
就是這樣把任務與屬下之間
That's how you rationalise making the choice

611
01:08:04,110 --> 01:08:07,170
所做的選擇合理化
between the mission and the men.

612
01:08:07,380 --> 01:08:10,250
但這次任務正是救人
Except that this time the mission is a man.

613
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,550
這個瑞恩最好值得我們去救
This Ryan had better be worth it.

614
01:08:19,290 --> 01:08:21,990
他回家後最好能行醫救人
He'd better go home and cure some disease

615
01:08:22,200 --> 01:08:26,360
或是發明長壽燈泡
or invent a longer-lasting light-bulb or something.

616
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:31,000
我想十個瑞恩也抵不了一個卡帕佐或維馳奧
For the truth is that I wouldn't trade ten Ryans for one Vecchio or Caparzo.

617
01:08:31,200 --> 01:08:33,000
阿門
Amen.

618
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,600
你看，又來了     長官
- Look, there it goes again.   - Sir.

619
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:41,670
還好吧
Are you alright?

620
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:50,920
兩小時後出發，小睡一會吧
We'll move out in two hours. Why don't you get some sleep?

621
01:08:51,930 --> 01:08:54,920
不知道他怎麼能做到的     什麼
- I don't know how he does it.   - What's that?

622
01:08:55,130 --> 01:08:57,650
如此熟睡，你看
Falls asleep like that. Look at him.

623
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:00,830
他躺下就睡著了
The guy's lights-out the minute his head hits the pack.

624
01:09:01,030 --> 01:09:04,370
因為問心無愧     有句話怎麼說
- Clear conscience.   - What's that saying?

625
01:09:04,570 --> 01:09:06,870
神與我們同在，那誰與敵軍同在
God's on our side, who could be on theirs?

626
01:09:07,070 --> 01:09:10,040
若神與我們同在，誰會是我們的對手
"If God be for us, who could be against us?"

627
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,340
不錯，我說了什麼
Yeah, what did I say?

628
01:09:12,550 --> 01:09:16,710
想睡著的話保持清醒就行了
The trick to falling asleep is trying to stay awake.

629
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:18,580
為什麼，韋德
How is that, Wade?

630
01:09:18,790 --> 01:09:23,690
我媽當實習醫師時習慣在夜間工作
When my mother was an intern she used to work through the night

631
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:25,320
白天睡覺
and sleep through the day.

632
01:09:26,330 --> 01:09:29,660
只有她回家我們才能聊天
The only time we talked was when she'd get home.

633
01:09:29,860 --> 01:09:36,790
我總會躺著，儘量保持清醒，但從沒成功過
I used to lie in bed and stay awake as long as I could,but it never worked

634
01:09:37,000 --> 01:09:41,300
我越不想睡就越快睡著
because the harder I tried the faster I'd fall asleep.

635
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:44,740
但在家裡沒關係，因為媽會回家
That wouldn't have mattered in my house.Ma would've come home,

636
01:09:44,940 --> 01:09:50,080
把我弄醒，聊到天亮，聊天時她總是不知道累
shook me awake,chatted me up 'til dawn.She was never too tired to talk.

637
01:09:50,280 --> 01:09:53,550
也許她在那個時候才有機會說話
That's probably the only time she could get a word in.

638
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:01,920
有趣的是有時她下班時間早了
Funny thing is,sometimes she would come home early

639
01:10:02,130 --> 01:10:04,490
我會假裝睡著了
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

640
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:08,530
誰，你媽嗎     對
- Who, your mum?   - Yeah.

641
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:14,470
她會站在門口看著我
She'd stand in the doorway looking at me,

642
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:17,540
我就閉眼裝睡
and I would just keep my eyes shut.

643
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:23,580
我知道她特地早些回來
And I knew that she just wanted to find out about my day,

644
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:30,280
跟我聊天，問我那天過得怎麼樣
that she came home early just to talk to me.

645
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:37,190
但我卻仍然不動，假裝已經熟睡
And I still wouldn't move. I'd still pretend to be asleep.

646
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:46,640
我也不知道為什麼會那樣做
I don't know why I did that.

647
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:03,590
只有幾個小時，閉嘴睡覺吧
We've only got a couple of hours. Shut up and go to sleep.

648
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:15,830
上尉，長官
Captain? Sir?

649
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,060
下士
Corporal.

650
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:27,010
你怎麼了，沒事吧
How are you doing? Are you alright?

651
01:11:27,210 --> 01:11:30,340
還好，我想這一切對我有益
Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir.

652
01:11:31,850 --> 01:11:35,380
真的嗎，為什麼
Really? How is that?

653
01:11:39,460 --> 01:11:43,830
“戰爭能訓練判斷力，磨練意志”
'War educates the senses, calls into action the will,"

654
01:11:44,030 --> 01:11:47,190
“增強體格”
"perfects the physical constitution,"

655
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:51,130
“人在生死關頭的瞬間”
"brings men in such swift and close collision in critical moments"

656
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:53,670
“強弱立判”
"that man measures man."

657
01:11:53,870 --> 01:11:58,640
愛默森也許是這樣讓自己積極起來的
I guess that's Emerson's way of finding the bright side.

658
01:11:58,850 --> 01:12:03,150
你也有讀愛默森啊     一點點
- You know Emerson, sir?   - I know some.

659
01:12:06,950 --> 01:12:11,290
上尉，你來自哪裡，在戰前你是做什麼的
So, where are you from, Captain? What did you do before the war?

660
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,080
賭金有多少了
What's the pool up to?

661
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:22,270
大概是三百塊吧
I think it's around 300, sir.

662
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:27,100
等到了五百的時候我就把答案告訴你，平分賭金
When it gets up to 500,I'll give you the answer and we'll split the money.

663
01:12:27,310 --> 01:12:29,300
你覺得怎麼樣
How about that?

664
01:12:29,510 --> 01:12:32,910
要是你這麼想我就有責任建議你
If that's the way you feel, I feel it's my duty under your command

665
01:12:33,110 --> 01:12:38,020
等賭金累積到一千塊
to suggest that we wait until it gets up to 1,000. I think it's...

666
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:41,780
要是活不了那麼久呢，怎麼辦
What if we don't live that long?

667
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,780
五百     五百也不錯
- 500?   - 500 would be good, yes.

668
01:12:47,990 --> 01:12:49,930
好的，長官
Yes, sir.

669
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:55,690
睡吧，下士     是，長官
- Get some sleep, Corporal.   - Yes, sir.

670
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:03,960
誰有磺胺粉
Who's got sulfa powder?

671
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:10,800
醫護兵，我弟兄在流血，需要止血帶
Medic, my buddy's bleeding! He needs a tourniquet.

672
01:14:11,010 --> 01:14:12,030
韋德     什麼事
- Wade.   - Yes, sir?

673
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:14,480
去幫他一下     是
- See what you can do.   - Yes, sir.

674
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:17,780
堅持住，很快就有人來救你
Hold on, fellas. It won't be much longer.

675
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:20,350
情況怎麼樣
How are we doing here?

676
01:14:20,550 --> 01:14:26,390
沒事的，別擔心，醫師來了
Alright. You're doing alright, don't worry about it. The Doc's in town.

677
01:14:27,990 --> 01:14:31,790
放心，29步兵團已突圍，很快到這裡
Don't worry. The 29th Infantry's breaking through. They'll be here soon.

678
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,300
誰有血漿
Has anybody got plasma?

679
01:14:34,500 --> 01:14:36,430
上尉
Hey, Captain!

680
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,130
有什麼消息嗎     我是德溫得中尉
- Soldier,you want to fill me in?   - Yeah.Lieutenant DeWindt.

681
01:14:40,340 --> 01:14:44,110
隸屬於第99運兵中隊，負責運載300與307滑翔機步兵
99th Troop Carrier Squadron carrying in 300th and 307th Glider Infantry.

682
01:14:44,310 --> 01:14:47,040
我是飛行員     二等兵
- This one was mine. I was the pilot.   - Private!

683
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:48,510
22人陣亡     來照顧他
- 22 men dead.   - Take care of this one.

684
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:51,480
我著陸時沒受一點傷，副駕駛卻死了
I landed there without a scratch, took my co-pilot's head right off.

685
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:53,410
這些人是誰
Who are these people?

686
01:14:53,620 --> 01:14:57,820
我們載的士兵第一晚就離開，之後沒再見過他們
The guys we came in with headed off the first night. Haven't seen them since.

687
01:14:58,020 --> 01:15:01,930
期間別的士兵三五成群地陸續出現
In the meantime other guys keep showing up. One, two, six at a time.

688
01:15:02,130 --> 01:15:04,930
然後有軍官來把散兵湊成部隊
Then some officer will come along, patch together a mixed unit

689
01:15:05,130 --> 01:15:07,460
再次出發作戰
and head off to make trouble.

690
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:11,870
我們在找101師506B連的二等兵瑞恩
We're looking for a Private Ryan, Baker Company, 506th of the 101st.

691
01:15:12,070 --> 01:15:14,230
這可難倒我了，這裡人來人往
You got me. A lot of guys come in and out.

692
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:17,670
厄本，到那隊人裡面找瑞恩
Upham! Check out that squad. See if Ryan's in it.

693
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:19,610
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

694
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:26,150
萊賓，聞聞他的腿像不像臭乳酪
Reiben! Smell that leg, right there. Find out if it's south of cheese.

695
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:34,680
什麼
What?

696
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:37,290
雙手放頭上
Hands over your head.

697
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:41,030
別停下來
Keep moving!

698
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,630
我是猶太人
I'm Jude, you know.

699
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:52,070
無法把他弄出來，我需要一台絞車
I couldn't pry him out of there. I need a winch.

700
01:15:52,280 --> 01:15:53,870
是的
Yeah.

701
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:59,350
是星級軍官     是的
- Stars.   - Yeah.

702
01:15:59,550 --> 01:16:03,960
阿門準將，101空降師的副指揮官
Brigadier General Amend. Deputy Commander, 101st.

703
01:16:04,190 --> 01:16:08,920
有些天才提議在機艙焊接鋼板
Some genius had the great idea of welding steel plates onto our deck

704
01:16:09,130 --> 01:16:11,490
以免地面的炮火傷到上將
to keep the General safe from ground fire,

705
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:15,830
但他們到空降前才告訴我們
but they forgot to tell me until just before we were getting airborne.

706
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,560
就像開貨運列車飛行般嗎
That's like trying to fly a freight train. OK?

707
01:16:19,770 --> 01:16:23,400
負荷過重，地面炮火又猛烈
Gross overload. Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

708
01:16:23,610 --> 01:16:26,480
我為了保持平衡手幾乎都弄斷了
I nearly broke both my arms trying to keep her level.

709
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:30,980
脫勾時我已經盡力了
When we released I cut as hard as I could,

710
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:34,480
嘗試保持高度，以免失速
trying to gain some altitude and keep her from stalling.

711
01:16:34,690 --> 01:16:39,560
最後像隕石一樣掉下來，結果變成這樣
We came down like a fucking meteor. And this is how we ended up.

712
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:44,390
其他飛機總算順利著陸
The others stopped easy enough, though.

713
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:48,160
我們的飛機太重了
We were just too damn heavy, you know?

714
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:53,600
草地濕滑，而且是下坡
The grass was wet. Downward slope and all.

715
01:16:53,810 --> 01:16:56,100
死了二十二人
22 guys dead.

716
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:02,350
全為了一個上將嗎     一個人
- All that for a general?   - One man.

717
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:07,350
這種事經常發生     “苦差”
- There's a lot of that going around.   - "FUBAR."

718
01:17:08,220 --> 01:17:10,210
“苦差”     “苦差”
- "FUBAR."   - "FUBAR."

719
01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:14,950
“苦差”     都說對了
- "FUBAR."   - You all got that right.

720
01:17:15,160 --> 01:17:17,860
我在德語字典中查不到“苦差”
I looked it up in a German dictionary. "FUBAR"'s not there.

721
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:20,590
厄本，那邊也有傘兵
Upham! There are more paratroopers out there.

722
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:23,130
去找瑞恩
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

723
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:26,270
你在這裡找找看
You might want to check this out, sir.

724
01:17:26,470 --> 01:17:29,960
是兵籍牌，多得數不完
Dog tags. More than I really want to count, sir.

725
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:34,880
我已蓋過許多屍體
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

726
01:17:35,110 --> 01:17:39,810
傑克森，從這些開始找吧     是
- Jackson. Start going through those.   - Yes, sir.

727
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,050
我來幫忙
I'll help.

728
01:17:45,060 --> 01:17:49,550
你覺得有那小子嗎     如果有我會找到的
- Do you think that little prick's in there?   - If he is,I'm going to find him.

729
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:52,490
我敢說那混蛋     我打賭他還活著
- I bet that son of a bitch...   - I've got money saying he's still alive.

730
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:56,500
賭十塊我會先找到     來看這裡有什麼
- 10 bucks says I nail him first.   - Let's see what we've got in here.

731
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:59,570
你沒希望了     你認為他在這裡面嗎
- You mugs don't stand a chance.   - Do you think he's in here?

732
01:17:59,770 --> 01:18:02,400
繼續找吧     好吧
- Just keep looking.   - Alright.

733
01:18:02,610 --> 01:18:06,310
蓋瑞·艾尼高、班瑞·比諾、麥克·塞裡奧
"Gary lanico", "Ben Rubino", "Mike Cesario"

734
01:18:06,330 --> 01:18:07,810
全都是幾內亞人
...All the Guineas are buying it.

735
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:12,420
不是這名字     維維裡·維琪，是你的朋友
- Come on, it's not the right name!   - 'Wee Willie Winkie". A buddy of yours.

736
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:15,150
我們得找到那混蛋
We've got to find this prick.

737
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,420
那混蛋在哪裡
Where's this son of a bitch?

738
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,930
別混在一起，分開一點
Don't mix them up. Keep them in your pile.

739
01:18:24,130 --> 01:18:26,430
怎麼知道哪些是看過的呢
How am I supposed to know who we've got?

740
01:18:26,630 --> 01:18:29,260
萊賓，閉嘴好嗎
Why don't you just shut up, Reiben?

741
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:33,700
別吵架     你不高興嗎
- Everybody be friends.   - Cranky there, huh?

742
01:18:33,910 --> 01:18:36,770
有優勝者了     你說什麼
- I think I've got a winner.   - What are you talking about?

743
01:18:36,980 --> 01:18:39,210
瑞恩     瑞恩
- "Ryan."   - Ryan?

744
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:42,940
梅利西，你看     你簡直是天才
- Take a look at that, Mellis.   - You're really a genius.

745
01:18:43,150 --> 01:18:47,680
這是裡恩，是法語名字，知道這是什麼意思嗎
"R-l-E-N-N-E." That's "Rienne" and it's French. Do you know what that means?

746
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:50,480
一無所獲     什麼比三條大
- It means "nothing".   - What beats three of a kind?

747
01:18:50,690 --> 01:18:55,060
這些人全都來自紐約     你總是發牢騷
- I got shit here, all guys from New York.   - You're always bitching.

748
01:18:55,260 --> 01:18:57,200
要幫忙嗎     我葫蘆
- Do you need a hand?   - I've got a full house.

749
01:18:57,400 --> 01:19:00,390
我贏了，同花順
I've got you beat. Straight flush.

750
01:19:00,600 --> 01:19:03,870
你偷看我的牌，你作弊
You're looking at my cards. You're cheating.

751
01:19:04,070 --> 01:19:08,010
笨得太離譜了，你識字嗎
Fucking unreal, this guy. Can you read that shit?

752
01:19:08,240 --> 01:19:12,800
天啊，你看這可憐的傢伙     大概不能防彈吧
- Jesus, look at this poor bastard!   - I guess they're not bulletproof.

753
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:14,240
應該不能
I guess not.

754
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:18,980
這傢伙沒腦袋     跟你的那裡一樣
- I don't like what's between his ears.  - It's like what's between your legs.

755
01:19:19,190 --> 01:19:22,590
你說得沒錯     傑克森，說得沒錯
- We've got to give him that.   - That's not bad for you, Jackson.

756
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:25,660
我三條     你們幹什麼
- I've got three of a kind.   - What the hell are you doing?

757
01:19:25,860 --> 01:19:29,620
整個空降師都在看著，這可不是撲克牌
The whole goddam Airborne's watching. These aren't poker chips.

758
01:19:29,830 --> 01:19:32,300
好吧     放回去
- Alright.   - Put them back in there.

759
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:58,680
他不在這裡
He's not here.

760
01:20:03,230 --> 01:20:05,660
也許我們該分頭去找吧
Maybe we should split into groups?

761
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:08,090
到樹林裡去叫他的名字
Just wander the woods calling his name.

762
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,030
他遲早會聽到的，瑞恩
He's bound to hear us sooner or later. Ryan!

763
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:14,800
上尉，這也不是辦法
That might be a little hard to do, Captain.

764
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:21,780
也許本地人見過他，瑞恩，詹姆斯·瑞恩
Maybe the locals have seen him. Ryan, James Ryan?

765
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:25,640
瑞恩，有人認識101空降師的瑞恩嗎
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan, 101st Airborne? You know Ryan?

766
01:20:25,850 --> 01:20:30,750
是愛阿華州的二等兵瑞恩嗎
Private James Ryan from lowa? Anybody know a Ryan?

767
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:34,390
瑞恩     阿喬
- James Ryan!   - Hey, Joe!

768
01:20:34,630 --> 01:20:38,860
麥可森不是認識C連的瑞恩嗎
Doesn't Michaelson pal around with a Ryan from C Company?

769
01:20:39,070 --> 01:20:42,330
應該是     帶他過來
- I think so.   - Bring him up.

770
01:20:51,710 --> 01:20:53,940
你認識二等兵瑞恩嗎     你要大聲一點
- You know Private Ryan?   - You have to speak up...

771
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:57,340
大聲一點，我的耳朵不靈光
You have to speak up, sir! My hearing is not so good!

772
01:20:57,550 --> 01:21:00,380
手榴彈在耳朵邊爆炸，聽力時有時無的
It comes and goes. A grenade went off right by my head.

773
01:21:00,590 --> 01:21:05,080
你認識二等兵瑞恩嗎     誰
- Got it. Do you know Private Ryan?   - Who?

774
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:08,780
二等兵瑞恩，詹姆斯·瑞恩     吉米·瑞恩
- Private Ryan? James Ryan?   - Jimmy Ryan?

775
01:21:08,990 --> 01:21:11,830
詹姆斯·法蘭西斯·瑞恩
James. James Francis Ryan.

776
01:21:12,030 --> 01:21:15,000
不，是詹姆斯·法蘭西斯·瑞恩
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

777
01:21:15,230 --> 01:21:18,290
給我紙筆
Give me a pencil. Something to write on.

778
01:21:18,500 --> 01:21:19,990
快點，鉛筆
Quick, a pencil!

779
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:24,140
小鉛筆給你
Here you are, a small one.

780
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:30,010
寫下來，詹姆斯·法蘭西斯·瑞恩，愛阿華州
Write this down: "James Francis Ryan? Iowa?"

781
01:21:30,220 --> 01:21:34,020
你認識他嗎，快看看
"Do you know him?" Read the message! Look!

782
01:21:36,690 --> 01:21:40,460
我當然認識他     知道他在哪裡嗎
- Yeah, of course I know him.   - Does he know where he is?

783
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,800
我們偏離了降落區二十英里
Yeah, we missed our dropzone by about 20 miles

784
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:51,190
降落的地方好像是布魯維裡什麼的
and ended up way over by "Bumville" or some damn place.

785
01:21:51,390 --> 01:21:54,460
我跟他和其他人正要到這裡集合
Him, me and a couple of others were coming here to the rally point.

786
01:21:54,670 --> 01:22:00,310
卻遇到一位上校正召集弟兄前往蘭姆勒
We ran into a colonel who was gathering up men to go to Ramelle.

787
01:22:00,500 --> 01:22:02,560
蘭姆勒     去防守一座橋
- Ramelle?   - To babysit a bridge.

788
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:05,720
那是我最後一次看見他     好極了，謝謝你
- That's the last I've seen of him.   - Great! Thank you!

789
01:22:05,950 --> 01:22:09,010
寫謝謝，你看，謝謝     不客氣
- Write "Thank you". Read. Thank you.   - You're welcome!

790
01:22:09,220 --> 01:22:10,950
大家過來
Assemble on me.

791
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,890
謝謝你，中尉
Thank you, Lieutenant.

792
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:19,520
蘭姆勒
Ramelle.

793
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:25,970
我們在這裡，蘭姆勒在麥德里特河畔
We're here. There. Ramelle is on the Merderet River,right here.

794
01:22:26,210 --> 01:22:28,260
在我們的西南方
Just to the southwest of us.

795
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:30,760
你知道那座橋嗎
You know anything about that bridge we just talk about?

796
01:22:30,970 --> 01:22:35,380
知道，瑟堡一直是盟軍的目標
Yeah. The target has always been Cherbourg.

797
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:40,700
要佔領深水港才能攻佔巴黎，而隆美爾也知道
We can't push on Paris until we take a deep water port and Rommel knows that.

798
01:22:40,910 --> 01:22:45,410
他會試著把裝甲部隊運過麥德里特河
He's going to try to get his armour across the Merderet River anyway he can.

799
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:50,460
這樣就能在我們進攻瑟堡時夾擊我們
That way he can hit us in the flank when we make the turn for Cherbourg.

800
01:22:50,660 --> 01:22:56,400
所以有橋樑的村莊都成了重要的據點
That makes any village on the river with a bridge solid gold real estate.

801
01:23:16,710 --> 01:23:18,040
走吧
Let's go.

802
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,190
上尉
Captain.

803
01:24:07,410 --> 01:24:10,270
那是什麼
What the hell is that?

804
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:13,440
廢棄的雷達站
A radar site. It's got to be out of action.

805
01:24:13,670 --> 01:24:19,580
下麵的沙坑裡有敵人
Looks like we've got something in that sandbag bunker under the station.

806
01:24:19,820 --> 01:24:23,770
看到嗎     對，我也這麼想
- See it?   - Yeah, that's my guess, too.

807
01:24:24,010 --> 01:24:28,880
那是什麼     機槍，或許是MG-42
- What is it?   - Machine gun, probably MG-42.

808
01:24:29,080 --> 01:24:32,950
那些人就是被它幹掉的嗎     也許瑞恩也在裡面
- Is that what got those guys?   - Maybe one of them is Ryan.

809
01:24:33,160 --> 01:24:36,090
不，他們是82隊的，你的運氣才沒那麼好
No, their patches are 82nd, so your luck's not that good.

810
01:24:36,330 --> 01:24:41,070
我不知道你們的腳程，但若我們悄悄地繞道
I don't know how fast you are, but if we detour this way quick and quiet,

811
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:42,960
德軍就不會知道我們在這裡
the Krauts will never even know we were here.

812
01:24:44,600 --> 01:24:47,970
為何不繞道走
What I'm trying to say is why don't we just go around the thing?

813
01:24:48,180 --> 01:24:51,900
我明白，但不能夠這樣
I hear what you're saying, but we can't go around it.

814
01:24:53,380 --> 01:24:57,000
我支持萊賓的說法，避開那些機槍就行了
I'm with Reiben. I mean, we left those 88s.

815
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:03,720
空軍可不會專程來對付一挺機槍
For the Air Force. They're not going to spend ordnance on one machine gun.

816
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:05,180
上尉
Captain.

817
01:25:06,460 --> 01:25:11,320
繞路還是能達成任務，這並不是我們的任務，對吧
We can skip it and still accomplish our mission. This isn't our mission, right?

818
01:25:11,530 --> 01:25:13,720
梅利西，你想這樣做嗎
Is that what you want to do, Mellish?

819
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:16,400
任由其他部隊中伏嗎
Leave it here so they can ambush another company?

820
01:25:16,630 --> 01:25:22,330
不，我只是說這並非我們的目標
No, I'm simply saying it's seems an unnecessary risk given our objective.

821
01:25:22,540 --> 01:25:24,970
我們的目標是打勝仗
Our objective is to win the war.

822
01:25:28,510 --> 01:25:32,410
我有不祥的預感
It's just that I don't have a good feeling about this one.

823
01:25:35,020 --> 01:25:38,920
你什麼時候有過好的預感了
When was the last time you felt good about anything?

824
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:02,670
好吧，三個人沖前開火
Alright. Three runners with suppressing fire.

825
01:26:02,910 --> 01:26:06,070
梅利西，你跑右邊，我跑中間
Mellish. You hook to the right, I'll go up the middle.

826
01:26:06,280 --> 01:26:08,220
誰跑左邊
Who's going left?

827
01:26:14,460 --> 01:26:17,020
誰跑左邊
Who's going left?

828
01:26:20,530 --> 01:26:22,860
我去
I'll do it.

829
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:25,430
我跑左邊     好
- I go left.   - Alright.

830
01:26:25,630 --> 01:26:29,000
厄本，跟傑克森對調，而你待在後面
Upham, switch off with Jackson and you linger in the rear.

831
01:26:30,670 --> 01:26:34,510
我們向前猛攻，迫使他換子彈
We advance and keep pressure on him 'til he has to change out his barrels.

832
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:38,280
然後就扔手榴彈
We should be able to hit them from grenade range.

833
01:26:38,510 --> 01:26:42,380
也許我該跑中間     你那種跑法嗎，不用了
- Maybe I should go up the middle?   - The way you run? I don't think so.

834
01:26:42,580 --> 01:26:46,850
也許我該跑左邊     也許你該閉嘴
- Maybe I should go left,sir.   - Maybe you should shut up!

835
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:49,920
萊賓，儘管開火
Reiben, base of fire.

836
01:26:58,170 --> 01:27:00,860
把彈藥帶在身邊
Mags and clips where you can reach them

837
01:27:01,070 --> 01:27:03,800
負責主攻的多帶些手榴彈
and extra grenades for the base runners.

838
01:28:28,860 --> 01:28:31,720
山上安全了，幹掉了四個     厄本
- Hill's clear. Four down and dead!   - Upham!

839
01:28:31,930 --> 01:28:35,520
收拾裝備帶上來，我們需要水和藥物
Grab the gear and get up here! We need water and extra dressing.

840
01:28:35,730 --> 01:28:40,530
從藥包裡把嗎啡拿出來
Get the morphine out of the medical kit!

841
01:28:52,110 --> 01:28:54,340
混蛋     撒上磺胺粉
- Son of a bitch!   - Get some sulfa on there.

842
01:28:54,550 --> 01:28:56,680
把我的腿抬高     行了
- Move my legs up.   - I got them.

843
01:28:56,890 --> 01:28:58,550
快倒磺胺粉     聽我說
- Pour sulfa.   - Listen to my voice.

844
01:28:58,750 --> 01:29:00,920
你會沒事的，醫師
You're going to be alright, Doc.

845
01:29:02,590 --> 01:29:04,680
沒事的，很快就能上醫療船
You're fine. You're going on a hospital ship.

846
01:29:04,890 --> 01:29:07,560
倒多一點     把腿抬起
- More sulfa!   - Move my legs up.

847
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,600
把腿抬高     行了
- Put my legs up.   - I've got them.

848
01:29:10,800 --> 01:29:12,730
你會沒事的     沒事，醫生
- You're going to be OK.   - It's alright, Doc.

849
01:29:12,940 --> 01:29:15,870
厄本，把水壺給我     快
- Upham, give me your canteen!   - Come on.

850
01:29:16,070 --> 01:29:20,300
我們會帶你離開的     壓著傷口
- We're going to get you out of here.   - Put some pressure on it.

851
01:29:20,510 --> 01:29:22,670
我中彈了嗎，傷勢怎麼樣     給他注射嗎啡
- Am I shot? How does it look?   - Give him some morphine.

852
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,870
傷勢怎麼樣     你會沒事的
- How does it look?   - You're going to be OK.

853
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,670
要注射嗎啡了
Here comes the morphine.

854
01:29:29,480 --> 01:29:32,390
被射中脊椎了嗎
Am I shot in the spine?

855
01:29:33,190 --> 01:29:35,490
沒事的     是不是射中脊椎
- You're OK.   - Am I shot in the spine?

856
01:29:35,690 --> 01:29:37,680
抬起他     把他翻過去
- Lift him up.   - Move him over.

857
01:29:37,930 --> 01:29:40,550
壓著傷口     輕點
- Put some pressure on.   - Easy, easy.

858
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:47,330
沒事的，醫生
It's OK, Doc. It's alright.

859
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:51,530
韋德，子彈穿了出去，你背後有個彈孔
Wade, you've got an exit wound. It's in the small of your back.

860
01:29:51,770 --> 01:29:55,170
那個洞有多大     像橡果那麼大
- How big is the hole?   - It's about the size of an acorn.

861
01:29:55,380 --> 01:29:57,810
好了     放下他
- It's fine.   - Put him back.

862
01:30:00,050 --> 01:30:04,140
壓住傷口
Put some pressure on it. Put some pressure on it.

863
01:30:04,350 --> 01:30:06,950
壓住傷口
Put some pressure on it!

864
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,920
用力一點
Put some more pressure on it.

865
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:13,720
還有更嚴重的傷口嗎
Is there anything bleeding worse than the others?

866
01:30:13,930 --> 01:30:17,090
有，這裡，知道在哪裡嗎，這裡
Yeah, right here. Do you know what it is? Right here.

867
01:30:17,300 --> 01:30:20,740
我把你的手放到上面     我們正壓著傷口
- I'll put your hand on it.   - We got some pressure on there.

868
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:22,800
就是這裡
That's the one.

869
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:27,070
天啊，那是我的肝臟
Oh, my God! My liver! It's my liver!

870
01:30:28,210 --> 01:30:30,510
教我們該怎麼救你
Tell us what to do. Tell us how to fix you.

871
01:30:30,710 --> 01:30:33,340
我們該怎麼辦，告訴我們
What can we do? Tell us what to do.

872
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:39,680
給我一點嗎啡
I could use a little morphine.

873
01:30:40,490 --> 01:30:43,010
多一點嗎啡
More morphine, sir.

874
01:30:43,230 --> 01:30:46,160
好的
OK. OK.

875
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,660
什麼     給他注射
- Sir? What?   - Give it to him.

876
01:30:53,340 --> 01:30:55,430
給他注射
Give it to him.

877
01:30:59,140 --> 01:31:04,010
我不想死     韋德，我們正在注射
- I don't want to die!   - Here you go, Wade. Here it comes.

878
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:10,610
再注射一劑
Give him another one.

879
01:31:17,830 --> 01:31:19,920
媽媽
Mama...

880
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,690
媽媽
Mama.

881
01:31:23,900 --> 01:31:27,530
我想回家
I want to go home, I want go home.

882
01:31:28,470 --> 01:31:31,270
媽媽
Mama, Mama, Mama...

883
01:31:31,470 --> 01:31:37,000
媽媽
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama...

884
01:32:17,290 --> 01:32:19,410
萊賓，抓住他
Reiben, hold him!

885
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:41,370
等一下
Not yet!

886
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:46,550
先叫他替韋德挖個墳墓
First make him mark and cover Wade's body for Grave Detail.

887
01:32:48,180 --> 01:32:51,310
也替那些傘兵挖個墳墓
Same thing for the paratroopers down there.

888
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:54,050
拿走他的裝備，查問他
Strip that stuff off him. Check him for intelligence.

889
01:32:54,260 --> 01:32:58,220
問這混蛋，韋德是不是他殺的，快問
Ask this piece of shit if he shot Wade! Ask him!

890
01:32:58,460 --> 01:32:59,890
有用嗎     有
- Does it matter?   - It does!

891
01:33:03,570 --> 01:33:06,360
閉上你的臭嘴
Shut up with that filthy pig Latin.

892
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:11,210
傑克森，你中彈了嗎
Jackson, are you hit?

893
01:33:14,210 --> 01:33:15,470
只是擦傷而已
It just skinned the arm.

894
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:21,080
把傷口處理好，你和中士留意周圍
Get it cleaned and dressed. You and Sarge watch the perimeter.

895
01:33:23,220 --> 01:33:27,310
他求我們別殺他     厄本，我不管他說什麼
- He says, "Please don't shoot."   - I don't care what he says, Upham.

896
01:33:28,620 --> 01:33:31,520
長官，你要讓他們殺他嗎
Sir? Sir, are you going to let them kill him?

897
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:36,860
這是不對的     那你去幫他埋屍體
- This is not right, sir.   - You can help him with the bodies.

898
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:41,330
這是什麼一回事
What is happening?

899
01:35:31,480 --> 01:35:34,540
美國人
American.

900
01:35:34,750 --> 01:35:36,650
我喜歡美國人
I like American.

901
01:35:44,030 --> 01:35:46,550
輪船威裡
Steamboat Willie.

902
01:35:46,760 --> 01:35:51,130
輪船威裡     輪船威裡，美國人
- Steamboat Willie.   - Steamboat Willie. American.

903
01:36:02,410 --> 01:36:08,280
他說他還沒完成     那是你的想法，來吧
- He says he's not finished.   - That's what you think. Come on.

904
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:20,120
求求你，我喜歡美國人
Please! I like America!

905
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,330
美國什麼都好
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

906
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:27,000
美國什麼都有
Go fly a kite! Cat got your tongue! Cool beans!

907
01:36:30,740 --> 01:36:33,670
貝蒂小姐，好性感
Betty Boop! What a dish.

908
01:36:33,910 --> 01:36:35,970
貝蒂嘉寶，腿很美
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

909
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:45,850
我說你看到嗎
I say can you see

910
01:36:46,050 --> 01:36:48,990
我說你看到嗎
I say can you see

911
01:36:49,190 --> 01:36:51,280
我說
I say...

912
01:36:58,200 --> 01:36:59,860
去你的希特勒
Fuck Hitler.

913
01:37:01,870 --> 01:37:03,860
去你的希特勒
Fuck Hitler!

914
01:37:12,650 --> 01:37:16,810
長官，他說他替韋德的死難過
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade. He says he's sorry about Wade.

915
01:37:17,020 --> 01:37:18,650
上尉
Captain!

916
01:37:18,850 --> 01:37:22,380
上尉，你也知道這樣做不對
Captain, this isn't right. You know this.

917
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:27,390
他是戰俘，他已經投降了
He's a prisoner. He surrendered. He surrendered, sir!

918
01:37:37,810 --> 01:37:39,430
告訴他
Tell him...

919
01:37:41,740 --> 01:37:46,610
朝那方向走一千步，然後脫掉蒙眼布
to march 1,000 paces in that direction.Then he can take off the blindfold.

920
01:37:46,820 --> 01:37:49,480
向首個遇到的盟軍自首
He turns himself in to the first Allied patrol.

921
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,280
你在說笑嗎，放他走
Are you kidding? We're letting him go?

922
01:37:51,490 --> 01:37:55,180
萊賓，他是戰俘，不能帶著他走
He's a POW, Reiben. We can't take him with us.

923
01:37:55,390 --> 01:37:59,990
我軍自會處置他     算他命大
- Our guys will pick him up.   - That was a close shave.

924
01:38:00,200 --> 01:38:02,160
真幸運
Lucky Strikes.

925
01:38:06,030 --> 01:38:08,200
帶我去看球賽
Take me out to the ball game...

926
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:14,100
萬一他被敵軍救回，又會回來作戰的
Only if he doesn't get picked up by his own and get thrown back into circulation.

927
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,550
上尉，你白白放過了敵人     簡直白癡
- Captain, you just let the enemy go.   - This is such bullshit.

928
01:38:19,780 --> 01:38:23,580
沒錯     白癡，這是白癡嗎
- You all got that right.   - Bullshit? This is bullshit?

929
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:26,350
難道可以射殺戰俘嗎，這樣是有違軍法的
Shooting a prisoner is OK? It's against the rules!

930
01:38:26,550 --> 01:38:30,960
軍法跟你的新朋友一起走了
The goddam rules just walked off with your new friend.

931
01:38:32,460 --> 01:38:35,830
上尉，這樣做是對的吧
But I guess that was the decent thing to do, Captain?

932
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,940
收拾東西，出發吧
Get your gear. Let's go.

933
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:50,610
你們聽到了，收拾東西
You heard him. Gear up.

934
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:54,940
上尉剛下了命令     是的
- The Captain just gave you an order.   - Yeah.

935
01:38:55,150 --> 01:38:58,880
就像他下令攻下機槍台一樣，真是大英雄
Like the one he gave to take this machine gun. That was a real doozy.

936
01:38:59,090 --> 01:39:00,520
你太過分了
You're out of line!

937
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:03,690
他命令我們拿下這裡真是英明
That was one hell of a call coming to take this nest,

938
01:39:03,890 --> 01:39:06,830
但我們卻因此喪失了一位隊友
but what the hell, we only lost one of our guys going for it.

939
01:39:07,030 --> 01:39:10,290
瑞恩媽媽一定很高興，知道她兒子的性命
I hope Mama Ryan's really happy knowing that little Jimmy's life

940
01:39:10,500 --> 01:39:12,860
比我們兩位隊友的還重要
was more important than two of our guys!

941
01:39:13,070 --> 01:39:16,060
但我們還沒找到他吧
But then, we haven't found them, have we?

942
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:19,270
你     放開我
- Hey...   - Get off me!

943
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:21,840
萊賓，起來
Reiben, get up.

944
01:39:23,110 --> 01:39:26,480
拿起東西，入列
Gear up. Fall in.

945
01:39:31,190 --> 01:39:33,620
我要退出這項任務
I'm done with this mission.

946
01:39:38,490 --> 01:39:40,980
等等
Hey! Hey!

947
01:39:41,860 --> 01:39:43,850
長官     你不能一走了之
- Sir...   - Don't you walk away from your captain!

948
01:39:44,100 --> 01:39:46,290
萊賓，給我回來     不
- Reiben, get back in line!   - No, sir.

949
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:49,200
我寧可坐牢也不想繼續了
I'll spend the rest of my life in the stockade rather than go on.

950
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,800
我說最後一遍     上尉
- I'm not going to ask you again.   - Captain!

951
01:39:52,010 --> 01:39:54,410
白癡     入列
- This is bullshit!   - Fall in!

952
01:39:54,610 --> 01:39:57,840
你要因為瑞恩而殺我嗎     不，是因為我討厭你
- Are you going to shoot me over Ryan?   - No, because I don't like you.

953
01:39:58,050 --> 01:40:00,240
他想走就讓他走吧
If he wants to go, just let him go!

954
01:40:00,450 --> 01:40:03,680
你不管嗎，上尉，你看到了嗎
Are you letting this happen? Captain! You see this?

955
01:40:03,890 --> 01:40:06,820
上尉，瑞恩已經死了
Captain. Sir, Ryan's dead.

956
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:09,420
白癡     這裡情況不妙
- Bullshit!   - We have a situation here.

957
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,020
我有很強的第六感
I have a sixth sense. I know it in my bones.

958
01:40:12,230 --> 01:40:14,890
你不殺德軍卻要殺我嗎
We didn't kill the Kraut. Now you're going to shoot me.

959
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:17,390
他比你好     下手吧
- He's better than you.   - Just do it!

960
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,000
打我的腿     我要打你的大嘴巴
- Put one in my leg...   - I'll shoot you in your big mouth!

961
01:40:22,200 --> 01:40:23,860
廢話少說，開槍吧
Put your money where your mouth is and do it!

962
01:40:24,070 --> 01:40:26,700
你總是那麼多話說
You don't know how to shut up.

963
01:40:26,910 --> 01:40:31,500
上尉，求求你     賭金有多少了
- Captain, please!   - What's the pool on me up to?

964
01:40:31,710 --> 01:40:35,010
你是個懦弱的混蛋     中士，我在等你開槍
- You are a coward son of a bitch!   - I'm waiting, Sarge.

965
01:40:35,220 --> 01:40:38,280
賭金累積到有多少了
What's the pool on me up to right now?

966
01:40:38,490 --> 01:40:40,780
有多少了
What's it up to?

967
01:40:40,990 --> 01:40:43,820
三百塊嗎
What is it? 300 dollars, is that it?

968
01:40:44,030 --> 01:40:46,260
我是個老師
I'm a schoolteacher.

969
01:40:49,830 --> 01:40:53,100
我教英文作文
I teach English Composition...

970
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:55,670
在賓夕法尼亞州一個叫艾德里的小鎮
in this little town called Addley, Pennsylvania.

971
01:40:55,870 --> 01:41:01,000
這十一年來我在湯瑪斯愛迪生高校任教
In the last 11 years, I've been at Thomas Alva Edison High School.

972
01:41:03,140 --> 01:41:07,480
在春季我是棒球教練
I was the coach of the baseball team in the springtime.

973
01:41:09,520 --> 01:41:11,250
我真該死
I'll be doggone.

974
01:41:11,450 --> 01:41:14,890
我在家鄉告訴人家我的職業時
Back home, when I tell people what I do for a living

975
01:41:15,120 --> 01:41:18,790
他們覺得“一看就知道”
they think, "Well, that figures."

976
01:41:19,860 --> 01:41:23,590
但到了這裡
But over here, it's...

977
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,100
卻成為了一個大秘密
a big, big mystery.

978
01:41:29,370 --> 01:41:33,270
我想我變了一點
So, I guess I've changed some.

979
01:41:34,640 --> 01:41:37,810
有時我想我改變了很多
Sometimes I wonder if I've changed so much

980
01:41:38,010 --> 01:41:42,070
回家後也許妻子會不認得我
my wife is even going to recognise me whenever I get back to her...

981
01:41:43,990 --> 01:41:46,850
或許我不能向她
and how I'll ever be able to...

982
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:51,990
訴說像今天這種事情
tell her about days like today.

983
01:41:54,300 --> 01:41:57,390
瑞恩
Ryan...

984
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:01,090
我對瑞恩一無所知，我才不管
I don't know anything about Ryan. I don't care.

985
01:42:01,340 --> 01:42:03,300
他跟我毫無關係，那只是個名字
He means nothing to me, it's just a name,

986
01:42:03,540 --> 01:42:10,740
但要是到蘭姆勒帶他回家
but if going to Ramelle and finding him so he can go home,

987
01:42:10,950 --> 01:42:14,750
能讓我回到妻子身邊
if that earns me the right to get back to my wife, then...

988
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:17,940
我會接下這項任務
...then that's my mission.

989
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:24,490
你想退出，重返戰場嗎
You want to leave? You want to go off and fight the war?

990
01:42:26,730 --> 01:42:29,360
沒關係
Alright.

991
01:42:29,560 --> 01:42:36,490
我不會阻止你，我甚至會替你申請
Alright, I won't stop you. I'll even put in the paperwork.

992
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:41,510
我只知道我多殺一人便離家越遠
I just know that with every man I kill, the farther away from home I feel.

993
01:44:06,290 --> 01:44:11,230
∮ 昔日的回憶湧現 ∮
by memories of days gone by

994
01:44:13,130 --> 01:44:18,000
∮ 孤獨中你嘲弄我 ∮
In my solitude you taunt me

995
01:44:18,210 --> 01:44:22,970
∮ 勾起不死的記憶 ∮
with memories that never die

996
01:44:23,180 --> 01:44:28,010
∮ 我坐在椅上滿懷絕望 ∮
I sit in my chair filled with despair

997
01:44:28,220 --> 01:44:33,180
∮ 比任何人都要哀傷 ∮
There's no one could be so sad

998
01:44:33,420 --> 01:44:37,820
∮ 看著坐著的地方盡是陰霾 ∮
With gloom everywhere I sit and I stare

999
01:44:38,030 --> 01:44:42,520
∮ 我很快就會瘋掉 ∮
I know that I'll soon go mad

1000
01:44:51,740 --> 01:44:53,830
有坦克，躲好
Half-track! Cover!

1001
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:13,490
是誰開槍
Who's doing the shooting? Who's doing the shooting?

1002
01:45:33,980 --> 01:45:36,420
準備行動，攻擊左邊
Get ready to move. Take their left flank!

1003
01:45:36,650 --> 01:45:38,850
小心點，以防有餘兵
Hold on and make sure they're down.

1004
01:46:00,370 --> 01:46:03,500
我們是101師，現在出來
101st! We're coming out!

1005
01:46:10,480 --> 01:46:13,420
裝甲兵第二師
That was a recon. element, 2nd SS.

1006
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:18,280
我們正在等待情報，一定是他們了
We've been expecting a probe. That must have been it.

1007
01:46:20,190 --> 01:46:23,490
第二突擊隊C連米勒上尉
Captain Miller, Charlie Company, 2nd Rangers.

1008
01:46:23,700 --> 01:46:25,790
501師E連漢德森下士
Corporal Henderson, Easy Company, 501st.

1009
01:46:26,000 --> 01:46:29,830
506團第一隊瑞恩     506團第三隊托恩比
- Ryan, First of 506th.   - Toynbee, Third of 506th.

1010
01:46:30,040 --> 01:46:35,770
詹姆斯·法蘭西斯·瑞恩     對，你怎麼會知道
- James Francis Ryan?   - Yes,sir.How did you guess that?

1011
01:46:46,550 --> 01:46:52,890
看來敵方攻勢猛烈     對，是小組部隊的進攻
- Looks like you got hit pretty hard.   - Yes,sir.Small unit action.

1012
01:46:55,260 --> 01:46:59,630
他們的88毫米炮威力強勁
They came in and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

1013
01:47:05,140 --> 01:47:08,540
要是你們就是救兵，我可要投訴
Tell you what. If you're our relief, I'm going to file a complaint.

1014
01:47:08,780 --> 01:47:11,200
我不會怪你
I wouldn't blame you.

1015
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:14,640
誰是你的指揮官
Who's your CO?

1016
01:47:14,850 --> 01:47:17,480
原本是簡甯斯上尉
It would've been Captain Jennings.

1017
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:20,800
但下士已是這兒的最高級軍官了
I'm afraid the best we can muster up now is a corporal.

1018
01:47:22,250 --> 01:47:25,230
那你們為什麼來這裡
So what are you guys all about?

1019
01:47:25,460 --> 01:47:28,950
我們為他而來，瑞恩
We're here for him. Ryan.

1020
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:31,030
我
Me, sir?

1021
01:47:39,970 --> 01:47:43,210
你是愛阿華州的詹姆斯·法蘭西斯·瑞恩吧
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1022
01:47:43,410 --> 01:47:48,530
對，愛阿華州佩頓市，這是怎麼回事
Yes, sir. Peyton,Iowa, that's correct. What is this about?

1023
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:53,280
你兄長陣亡了
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1024
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:02,200
哪一個
Which ones?

1025
01:48:04,770 --> 01:48:07,060
全部
All of them.

1026
01:48:15,080 --> 01:48:17,690
真的嗎
On the level?

1027
01:48:19,050 --> 01:48:22,410
恐怕是真的
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1028
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,620
大概要一段時間才能接受
You might want to take some time with this.

1029
01:48:25,850 --> 01:48:29,110
要是你想到什麼地方
If there's someplace you want to go and...

1030
01:48:37,890 --> 01:48:40,730
是怎麼回事     瑞恩的兄弟去世了
- What's this all about?   - Ryan lost his brothers.

1031
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:43,960
哪一個     全部
- Which one?   - All of them.

1032
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,970
你們專程跑來告訴我嗎
You came all the way out here to tell me that?

1033
01:48:57,350 --> 01:49:00,580
你要回家
You're going home.

1034
01:49:00,790 --> 01:49:03,520
我們奉命帶你回去
Our orders are to bring you back.

1035
01:49:07,020 --> 01:49:09,220
帶我回去
Bring me back?

1036
01:49:10,800 --> 01:49:15,590
下士，我不是想令你人手短缺，但這是命令
Corporal,I don't mean to leave you more short-handed,but orders are orders.

1037
01:49:15,790 --> 01:49:18,420
想跟什麼人聯絡嗎
Any communications about when you will be relieved?

1038
01:49:18,630 --> 01:49:21,570
我們也不知道南方的情況
We can't tell. We don't know what's happening south of us.

1039
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:25,130
但我的命令不許我擅離職守
My orders don't include me abandoning my post.

1040
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:27,970
我知道，但情況有變
I understand that, but this changes things.

1041
01:49:28,180 --> 01:49:30,450
我不認同
I don't see that it does, sir.

1042
01:49:32,090 --> 01:49:35,670
這是美軍參謀長的命令
The Chief of Staff for the US Army says it does.

1043
01:49:35,880 --> 01:49:38,090
我們奉命死守這座橋
Our orders are to hold this bridge at all costs.

1044
01:49:38,290 --> 01:49:41,390
我方戰機已經把麥德里特河的所有橋樑炸斷
Our planes in the 82nd have taken out every bridge across the Merderet,

1045
01:49:41,600 --> 01:49:44,380
除了瓦隆尼和這裡兩處
with the exception of two: one at Valognes and this one.

1046
01:49:44,590 --> 01:49:47,080
要是給德軍拿下我們就要退守
If the Germans take it, we'll have to displace.

1047
01:49:47,330 --> 01:49:52,230
部隊的任務是一回事，但你要離開了
Private.It's one thing that your outfit wants to stay,but your party's over here.

1048
01:49:52,460 --> 01:49:54,330
援軍到達前我不能離開
I can't leave before the reinforcements are here.

1049
01:49:54,530 --> 01:49:56,930
三分鐘內收拾行裝
You've got three minutes to get your gear.

1050
01:49:57,130 --> 01:50:00,880
那他們怎麼辦     混蛋
- What about them,there's barely...   - Hey,asshole!

1051
01:50:01,080 --> 01:50:04,970
我們兩位隊友已經為你送命
Two of our guys already died trying to find you.

1052
01:50:10,490 --> 01:50:13,420
真的嗎     是的
- Sir?   - That's right.

1053
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:27,340
他們叫什麼名字     艾文·韋德和艾德林·卡帕佐
- What were their names?   - Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1054
01:50:29,510 --> 01:50:31,020
韋德和誰
Wade and?

1055
01:50:32,340 --> 01:50:34,070
卡帕佐
Caparzo.

1056
01:50:46,380 --> 01:50:48,730
沒有理由要這樣
It doesn't make any sense.

1057
01:50:50,860 --> 01:50:55,000
這樣沒道理，我有什麼資格離開
It doesn't make any sense, sir. Why do I deserve to go?

1058
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:58,070
為什麼不是他們，他們也同樣努力
Why not any of these guys? They all fought just as hard as me.

1059
01:51:03,030 --> 01:51:06,140
你死後傳訊員就要跟
Is that what they're supposed to tell your mother

1060
01:51:06,350 --> 01:51:09,400
你母親這樣說嗎
when they send her another folded American flag?

1061
01:51:16,660 --> 01:51:19,910
跟她說你在這裡找到我
Tell her that when you found me I was here,

1062
01:51:20,120 --> 01:51:22,880
我要跟軍中其他兄弟在一起
and I was with the only brothers that I have left,

1063
01:51:23,090 --> 01:51:27,180
我怎樣也不會離棄他們
and that there was no way I was going to desert them.

1064
01:51:27,390 --> 01:51:32,560
她應該會明白，我不會離開這座橋
I think she'll understand that. There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1065
01:52:15,610 --> 01:52:17,670
現在怎麼辦
What are your orders?

1066
01:52:19,480 --> 01:52:23,480
中士，我們進入了一個奇異的國度
Sergeant, we have crossed some strange boundary here.

1067
01:52:23,720 --> 01:52:26,240
一切都異乎尋常
Our world has taken a turn for the surreal.

1068
01:52:26,480 --> 01:52:29,880
但問題始終要解決
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1069
01:52:30,090 --> 01:52:33,960
我不知道，你覺得怎樣
I don't know. What do you think?

1070
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:36,650
你不會想知道
You don't want to know what I think.

1071
01:52:38,730 --> 01:52:40,890
不，我想知道
No, Mike, I do.

1072
01:52:44,070 --> 01:52:47,970
我一方面同意他的說法他有什麼資格
Part of me thinks the kid's right. What's he done to deserve this?

1073
01:52:48,170 --> 01:52:52,180
他既然想留下來，我們就乾脆回去
If he wants to stay here, fine. Let's leave him and go home.

1074
01:52:53,180 --> 01:52:55,040
是的
Yeah.

1075
01:52:55,250 --> 01:53:00,380
但我還有一個想法，要是我們也留下來
But another part of me thinks, "What if by some miracle we stay"

1076
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:03,350
會締造什麼奇跡呢
"and actually make it out of here?"

1077
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:07,460
有天我們回想此事
Some day we might look back on this and decide that

1078
01:53:07,690 --> 01:53:12,150
也許會覺得在這場混帳戰爭中
saving Private Ryan was the one decent thing we pulled out of

1079
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:17,160
拯救瑞恩是唯一的好事
this whole godawful, shitty mess.

1080
01:53:17,370 --> 01:53:24,170
這是我的想法，上尉，如你所言
That's what I was thinking, sir. Like you said, Captain.

1081
01:53:25,680 --> 01:53:30,840
我們會留下來一起為團聚戰鬥
We do that, we all earn the right to go home.

1082
01:53:33,650 --> 01:53:35,780
兄弟
Oh, brother...

1083
01:53:38,420 --> 01:53:41,360
只有這些武器
This is everything.

1084
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:47,690
23毫米機槍、17枚手榴彈、11個霍金斯地雷
You've got the.230 calibre machine guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1085
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:51,100
你有兩支火箭筒，但只能發射八次
You've got two bazookas, but they've only got eight rounds left.

1086
01:53:51,300 --> 01:53:53,430
還有各式小手槍
And assorted small arms.

1087
01:53:53,640 --> 01:53:56,870
本來有60毫米迫擊炮，但已損毀
We had a.60 mortar, but an arty round took it out.

1088
01:53:57,070 --> 01:53:59,700
敵軍坦克壓過來我們吐口水攻擊好了
Might as well be spit wads if they roll on us with tanks.

1089
01:53:59,910 --> 01:54:04,510
敵軍當然會動用坦克     你有什麼意見
- Which they're sure to do.   - What are you thinking, sir?

1090
01:54:04,720 --> 01:54:08,120
我提議進行夾擊
I'm thinking I'm going to whip around the flanks.

1091
01:54:12,460 --> 01:54:15,720
要把他們引到大街
Unless we can draw them up the main road between the buildings,

1092
01:54:15,930 --> 01:54:19,420
用瓦礫造一個瓶頸
where all the rubble makes a bit of a bottleneck

1093
01:54:19,660 --> 01:54:21,820
讓坦克無用武之地嗎     可以的話
- Disable him?   - If we can.

1094
01:54:22,030 --> 01:54:25,660
造個六十噸的路障，然後展開夾擊
Make a 60-tonne roadblock. Then we've got a fighting chance at her flanks.

1095
01:54:25,870 --> 01:54:28,000
好，分散他們，別讓他們集結
Good. Split them up, don't let them mass.

1096
01:54:28,210 --> 01:54:31,070
然後逐一擊破，再退回大橋
Hit them hard one-on-one, and fall back to the bridge.

1097
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:35,610
下麵放一台機槍，另一台置於高處
Machine gun on the move down here, number two up high to piss on them.

1098
01:54:35,810 --> 01:54:40,270
計畫就是這樣，傑克森
That would be the idea. Jackson!

1099
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:42,820
可以的話我想你去鐘樓
If we can, I'd like to get you up in that bell tower.

1100
01:54:43,020 --> 01:54:46,050
知道     我會給你安排幫手
- Yes, sir.   - I'll give you some company.

1101
01:54:46,290 --> 01:54:52,200
也好，還要30毫米狙擊槍和一千發子彈
Some company couldn't hurt. A.30 with about a 1,000 rounds would be OK.

1102
01:54:52,430 --> 01:54:54,360
派克，有工作給你
Parker, job opportunity.

1103
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,360
這主意不錯
It's not the worst idea ever,

1104
01:54:56,570 --> 01:55:00,230
但勝負關鍵在於把坦克弄到街上讓我們夾擊
but everything depends on getting the tank down the road for us to knock out.

1105
01:55:00,440 --> 01:55:03,770
你有什麼計畫
How the hell do you plan on doing that?

1106
01:55:03,970 --> 01:55:06,640
他說得對，空降師的隊友剛說
He's right. As our colleague from Airborne pointed out

1107
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:09,110
我們有的是口水
what we've got is a bunch of spit wads.

1108
01:55:09,310 --> 01:55:13,150
但把坦克引來後怎麼應付
How do we stop the tank if we get it to commit?

1109
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:14,820
先用兔子引它追趕
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1110
01:55:15,850 --> 01:55:18,520
接著攻擊坦克的履帶
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1111
01:55:19,190 --> 01:55:20,520
對，但用什麼攻擊
Yeah, but with what?

1112
01:55:22,990 --> 01:55:27,790
用粘附式炸彈     粘附式炸彈
- We could try a sticky bomb.   - Sticky bomb, sir?

1113
01:55:28,000 --> 01:55:30,160
是你編出來的吧
Sir, are you making that up?

1114
01:55:30,370 --> 01:55:33,560
不，你可以去翻翻作戰手冊
No, it's in the field manual. Check it out, if you want to.

1115
01:55:33,770 --> 01:55:37,900
手冊不知道在那裡，你儘管講解一下
We seem to be out of field manuals. Perhaps you could enlighten us.

1116
01:55:38,110 --> 01:55:41,340
有炸藥吧，黃色炸藥還是B成分炸藥
You have some demolition, don't you? TNT or Composition B?

1117
01:55:41,550 --> 01:55:45,740
很多，橋那裡的B炸藥，足以把橋炸斷兩次
Plenty. I've got that bridge wired with enough Composition B to blow it twice.

1118
01:55:45,950 --> 01:55:47,440
那拿一點出來
You can spare some, then.

1119
01:55:48,220 --> 01:55:54,590
用一隻軍襪裝滿炸藥
You take a standard GI sock, cram it full with Composition B,

1120
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:59,790
再加進導火線，表面塗滿機油
and rig up a simple fuse. Then you coat the whole thing with axle grease.

1121
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:03,400
炸彈扔出就能粘附於目標物
That way, when you throw it, it should stick.

1122
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:06,070
有粘力，所以叫粘附式炸彈
It's a bomb that sticks. It's a sticky bomb.

1123
01:56:06,300 --> 01:56:10,210
有更好的方法，儘管說出來
Come up with a better way to knock the tracks off a tank, I'm all ears.

1124
01:56:10,440 --> 01:56:13,930
這主意不錯，我們要把襪子奉獻
This is good. Now we have to surrender our socks!

1125
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:30,050
拉上去
Haul away.

1126
01:56:43,740 --> 01:56:48,110
選擇攻擊範圍，與鐘樓組成交叉火力網
Select the field of fire. Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1127
01:56:48,310 --> 01:56:50,250
我負責左方的地區
I can cover 12 to 9 from here.

1128
01:56:54,520 --> 01:56:57,010
慢慢來     拿到了
- Easy!   - I've got her!

1129
01:57:31,120 --> 01:57:33,060
這是地雷
Here are the mines.

1130
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:46,200
要配置得當才行
For being the best we can do,

1131
01:57:46,400 --> 01:57:51,270
前面的機槍位置不太好
that forward machine gun is not in a terrible firing position.

1132
01:57:52,940 --> 01:57:55,380
應該放到這裡
And this position right here...

1133
01:57:57,610 --> 01:57:59,640
這是最後防線
This is the Alamo.

1134
01:57:59,880 --> 01:58:03,220
要是退到這裡，最後一個活人負責炸橋
They push us this far, the last man alive blows the bridge.

1135
01:58:03,420 --> 01:58:06,290
導火線能燒三十秒，告訴大家
We've only got a 30-second delay on the fuse, so tell everyone

1136
01:58:06,490 --> 01:58:11,120
點火後快逃，不然性命不保
that if you're last you'd better hurry or you'll not live long.

1137
01:58:12,000 --> 01:58:15,930
上尉，我有什麼任務
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1138
01:58:16,170 --> 01:58:20,500
留在我兩英尺之內，不許有異議
Never more than two feet away from me. And that's not negotiable.

1139
01:58:21,540 --> 01:58:24,940
跟我去拿彈藥
I'm going to get some ammo. Come on.

1140
01:58:27,080 --> 01:58:30,310
厄本，聽著     是的
- Hey, Upham, listen to me.   - Yes.

1141
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:32,880
你在聽嗎     是的
- Are you listening?   - Yes.

1142
01:58:33,080 --> 01:58:36,710
我們會不斷東奔西跑
We're going to be displacing and falling back like crazy sons of bitches,

1143
01:58:36,920 --> 01:58:41,450
你要運送彈藥，隨傳隨到，不然我們就死定
so you've got to be Johnny-on-the-spot with the ammo,or we're dead.

1144
01:58:41,690 --> 01:58:43,090
你明白嗎     隨傳隨到
- Do you understand?   - Johnny-on-the-spot.

1145
01:58:43,290 --> 01:58:47,160
你沒事吧     沒事
- Yeah. Are you alright?   - Yeah.

1146
01:58:48,470 --> 01:58:51,590
我們從英國出發時也會分發香煙
When we shipped out of England we got cigarettes

1147
01:58:51,800 --> 01:58:54,570
我卻說“謝謝，我不抽煙”
and I said, "No, thank you. I don't smoke."

1148
01:58:59,180 --> 01:59:03,200
形勢很兇險吧     難以置信
- Quite a situation, huh?   - Unbelievable.

1149
01:59:03,450 --> 01:59:09,220
這差事混帳得不得了
Yeah. "Fucked-Up Beyond All Recognition", right?

1150
01:59:09,420 --> 01:59:11,890
沒錯
You've got that right.

1151
01:59:13,690 --> 01:59:17,020
“苦差”     是的
- "FUBAR"!   - Alright!

1152
01:59:17,230 --> 01:59:18,460
很痛
Ouch.

1153
01:59:18,660 --> 01:59:22,760
這可不是玩的
Yeah, well... It's going to be a real show, huh?

1154
01:59:22,970 --> 01:59:24,900
知道了
Yeah, OK.

1155
01:59:31,010 --> 01:59:32,870
放輕鬆
Take it easy.

1156
01:59:33,810 --> 01:59:35,440
“苦差”
"FUBAR."

1157
02:00:13,320 --> 02:00:16,380
是誰的歌聲
Who's that singing, sir?

1158
02:00:16,620 --> 02:00:18,550
艾迪斯·皮雅福
Edith Piaf.

1159
02:00:20,060 --> 02:00:23,320
她為什麼這麼傷心
What is she so upset about?

1160
02:00:23,530 --> 02:00:28,660
情人離異，但她的面容歷歷在目
Her lover left her, but she still sees his face everywhere she goes.

1161
02:00:29,930 --> 02:00:31,730
就是這樣
That would do it.

1162
02:01:00,930 --> 02:01:04,130
∮ 生命中就只有你 ∮
"Even life itself only represents you."

1163
02:01:07,040 --> 02:01:09,530
∮ 夢著你擁我入懷 ∮
"Sometimes I dream that I'm in your arms."

1164
02:01:09,770 --> 02:01:13,170
那是什麼，她曾經唱過     是副歌
- What was that? She sang it before.   - The chorus.

1165
02:01:13,410 --> 02:01:15,110
副歌
The chorus.

1166
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:18,210
∮ 每當你耳語喃喃 ∮
"And you speak softly in my ear."

1167
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,880
∮ 都讓我閉目靜聽 ∮
"And you say things that make my eyes close."

1168
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:29,020
∮ 感覺美妙 ∮
"And I find that marvellous."

1169
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:32,460
厄本
Again, Upham...

1170
02:01:32,660 --> 02:01:37,900
老實說，你使我莫名的興奮
...to be honest, I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1171
02:01:38,100 --> 02:01:39,590
棒極了
Marvellous.

1172
02:01:39,840 --> 02:01:43,570
這首歌很哀傷，開始時她唱著
It's a really melancholy song. At the beginning of the song she says:

1173
02:01:43,770 --> 02:01:49,580
∮ 你離去後，我就傷心絕望 ∮
"And then one day you left me and I've been desperate ever since."

1174
02:01:49,780 --> 02:01:52,750
∮ 漫天滿地，都是你的影子 ∮
"I see you all over the sky, I see you all over the earth."

1175
02:01:52,980 --> 02:01:56,380
再聽多幾首這種歌不用德軍開槍
Any more songs like this, the Krauts won't have to shoot me.

1176
02:01:56,620 --> 02:01:59,250
我就割脈自殺了
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1177
02:01:59,460 --> 02:02:01,890
厄本，你好奇怪
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1178
02:02:02,130 --> 02:02:04,060
對不起，是艾迪斯
I'm sorry. It's Edith, you know.

1179
02:02:04,290 --> 02:02:06,060
知道這首歌讓我想起什麼嗎
You know what that song reminds me of?

1180
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:10,430
瑞雪太太在我出發前的一番話
Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz and what she said when I left for Basic.

1181
02:02:10,630 --> 02:02:13,070
說什麼     她說“別碰我”
- What?   - "Don't touch me?"

1182
02:02:13,300 --> 02:02:15,740
不，她是公寓管理員的妻子
No. She's our Super's wife.

1183
02:02:15,940 --> 02:02:22,370
她到我媽的店買衣服，胸圍有44EE
She comes into my mum's shop to try a few things. She's like a 44 Double E.

1184
02:02:22,610 --> 02:02:24,240
EE     好大呢
- Double E?   - They're massive.

1185
02:02:24,450 --> 02:02:25,810
是一對大胸脯
Those are big titties.

1186
02:02:26,020 --> 02:02:29,980
我騙她穿42D的衣服，我們在更衣室裡
I've got her convinced that she's a 42 D. So we're in the dressing room

1187
02:02:30,220 --> 02:02:34,180
她嘗試擠進那件絲帶束腰
and she tries to get into this side-cut,silk-ribboned,triple-panel girdle

1188
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:36,760
還有神奇胸罩
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1189
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:39,290
很好看，都擠了出來
It's beautiful. She's pouring out of this thing.

1190
02:02:39,500 --> 02:02:41,230
很緊嗎     不，很美
- Is it tight?   - No, it's beautiful.

1191
02:02:41,430 --> 02:02:45,560
她看得出我的小弟像自由神像般又大又硬
She sees me and can tell I've got a hard-on the size of the Statue of Liberty.

1192
02:02:45,770 --> 02:02:49,140
於是她叫我冷靜
She says, "Richard, calm down", and she says,

1193
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:53,240
又說要是在戰場上難過害怕
"Over there, if you see anything that upsets you, if you're scared,"

1194
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:59,850
就閉眼想想它們
"I want you to close your eyes and think of these, you understand?"

1195
02:03:00,080 --> 02:03:02,570
我說我明白了
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1196
02:03:15,230 --> 02:03:18,170
你沒事吧
Are you alright, sir?

1197
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:20,800
我在數拍子
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1198
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:29,910
你在老家真的是老師嗎
Is it true you were a teacher back home?

1199
02:03:30,110 --> 02:03:33,840
是的     我是當不上老師的了
- Yes.   - That's something I could never do.

1200
02:03:34,050 --> 02:03:38,180
我家兄弟都不聽老師的話
Not with the way me and my brothers treated our teachers. No, sir!

1201
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:43,950
我教過上千個你這樣的孩子
I had a thousand kids like you.

1202
02:03:49,630 --> 02:03:53,470
我想不起哥哥的樣貌
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1203
02:03:53,670 --> 02:03:58,510
怎樣努力也想不起來，你試過這樣嗎
I've been trying and I can't see their faces at all. Has that happened to you?

1204
02:03:58,710 --> 02:04:01,140
你要想想發生過的事
You've got to think of a context.

1205
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:05,270
那是什麼意思
What does that mean?

1206
02:04:05,520 --> 02:04:09,210
不能只想他們的樣子，要想些具體事情
You don't just think about their faces, you think about something specific,

1207
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:11,750
你們的共同經歷
something you've done together.

1208
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:18,260
我想家的時候想得很具體
When I want to think of home, I think of something specific.

1209
02:04:18,460 --> 02:04:22,260
我想起後院的吊床
I think of my hammock in the backyard

1210
02:04:22,470 --> 02:04:27,840
或者是妻子戴起我的舊手套修剪玫瑰花叢
or my wife pruning the rose bushes in a pair of my old work gloves.

1211
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:36,600
有一晚兩個哥哥把我弄醒
This one night, two of my brothers woke me up in the middle of the night.

1212
02:04:38,350 --> 02:04:41,680
說要給我驚喜
They said they had a surprise for me.

1213
02:04:41,890 --> 02:04:45,050
他們帶我到穀倉的閣樓
They took me to the barn up into the loft

1214
02:04:45,260 --> 02:04:49,160
原來大哥丹尼
and there was my oldest brother Dan

1215
02:04:49,390 --> 02:04:52,380
跟愛莉絲·賈汀在裡面
with Alice Jardine!

1216
02:04:54,970 --> 02:04:59,430
想像一下，那女孩從樹上掉下來
Picture a girl who just took a nosedive from the ugly tree

1217
02:04:59,670 --> 02:05:02,870
會讓所有樹枝都給壓斷
and hit every branch coming down!

1218
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:06,730
丹尼脫去她的襯衫
And Dan's got her shirt off...

1219
02:05:06,980 --> 02:05:13,680
接著要把胸罩也脫下時肖恩突然大叫
So he's trying to get her bra off and all of a sudden Sean screams out

1220
02:05:13,880 --> 02:05:17,840
“丹尼，你年紀還小，不可以這樣”
"Danny, you're a young man. Don't do it!"

1221
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:23,080
愛莉絲·賈汀馬上大叫，跳了起來
Alice Jardine hears this and she screams and jumps up

1222
02:05:23,330 --> 02:05:26,730
想沖出去，但她的頭給襯衫蒙著
and tries to run out, but she's got her shirt over her head.

1223
02:05:26,930 --> 02:05:30,760
所以撞到牆壁，暈了過去
She runs into the wall and knocks herself out.

1224
02:05:30,970 --> 02:05:34,870
丹尼很生氣，追著我們
Now Dan is so mad at us. He starts coming after us,

1225
02:05:35,070 --> 02:05:39,410
但愛莉絲暈倒了，他要弄醒她
but at the same time Alice is unconscious. He's got to wake her up.

1226
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:42,310
於是一手抓著她的腿猛拉
He grabs her by a leg and drags her

1227
02:05:42,510 --> 02:05:45,850
一手拿著鏟子追趕肖恩
and at the same time he picks up a shovel and goes after Sean!

1228
02:05:46,050 --> 02:05:50,950
肖恩說“你幹嘛打我，我是在幫你”
And Sean says, "Why are you trying to hit me? I just did you a favour!"

1229
02:05:51,890 --> 02:05:55,720
丹尼更加生氣，亂揮鏟子
This makes Dan more angry. He tries to swing this thing.

1230
02:05:55,930 --> 02:05:59,620
最後鏟子脫手，打破了火油燈
He loses his shovel. It goes out of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.

1231
02:05:59,830 --> 02:06:05,430
爆炸著火，穀倉幾乎給燒掉
The thing explodes. The whole barn almost goes up because of this thing.

1232
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:22,850
這就是最後一晚，丹第二天就上戰場去
That was it, that was the last... Dan went off to Basic the next day.

1233
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:26,720
這是四兄弟最後一次共聚
That was the last night the four of us were together.

1234
02:06:26,920 --> 02:06:28,950
已經過了兩年
That was two years ago.

1235
02:06:31,060 --> 02:06:33,120
天啊
Oh, my.

1236
02:06:34,230 --> 02:06:38,930
再說說妻子和玫瑰花叢的事
Tell me about your wife and those rose bushes.

1237
02:06:39,140 --> 02:06:44,040
不，那些事要留給自己
No. No, that one I save just for me.

1238
02:07:49,610 --> 02:07:51,270
敵人從東面開來
Enemy from the east.

1239
02:07:52,940 --> 02:07:57,500
兩倆虎式坦克，兩輛裝甲車
He sees two Tiger tanks, two Panzer tanks.

1240
02:07:57,750 --> 02:08:01,650
五十人以上的步兵隊伍
Infantry. 50 plus change.

1241
02:08:10,530 --> 02:08:13,520
分散，各就各位，萊賓，去當兔子
Disperse! You know what to do. Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1242
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:18,000
厄本，躲起來     梅利西、漢德森，準備開火
- Upham, get some cover.   - Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1243
02:08:18,200 --> 02:08:20,690
大家檢查武器
Everybody check your ammo!

1244
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:25,600
萊賓，祝你好運     不用祝福，我生來幸運
- Good luck,Reiben!   - I don't need any luck,I was born lucky!

1245
02:08:38,660 --> 02:08:41,990
拿著五枚曳光彈     知道，照亮兩端
- One in five tracer.   - Yes, and tracers point both ways.

1246
02:08:42,190 --> 02:08:45,460
去檢查頂端的空間
Why don't you check the head space and she should run.

1247
02:08:53,870 --> 02:08:56,740
厄本，快點
Upham, hustle up!

1248
02:09:46,490 --> 02:09:50,390
厄本下士，這裡沒有30毫米口徑機槍
Corporal Upham. We don't have a.30 calibre machine gun here.

1249
02:09:50,590 --> 02:09:56,050
梅利西和鐘樓的傑克森才需要這個
Either Mister Mellish or Mr Jackson in the bell tower needs that.

1250
02:09:56,300 --> 02:09:59,360
厄本，傑克森有子彈，去拿給梅利西
Upham! Jackson's fine, turn around to Mellish!

1251
02:10:20,890 --> 02:10:24,620
有很多步兵，不知道會否上釣
