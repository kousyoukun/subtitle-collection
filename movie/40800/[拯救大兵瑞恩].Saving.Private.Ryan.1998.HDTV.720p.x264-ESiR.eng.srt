1
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,695
Dad?

2
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:32,474
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
May God be with you!

3
00:05:32,644 --> 00:05:37,138
Port side and starboard side stick!
Move fast and clear those mortar holes!

4
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:40,114
I want to see plenty of beach between men.

5
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:43,948
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:44,123 --> 00:05:48,787
Keep the sand out of your weapons!
Keep those actions clear!

7
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:50,292
I'll see you on the beach!

8
00:06:22,995 --> 00:06:26,795
Clear the mortar hole!
Right and left!

9
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:43,143
Over the side!

10
00:06:49,555 --> 00:06:51,614
Port and starboard!

11
00:08:03,028 --> 00:08:04,791
Thank yo...

12
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,263
What now, sir?

13
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:26,699
I said, "What the hell do we do now, sir?"

14
00:10:28,206 --> 00:10:31,869
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

15
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:37,507
Captain Miller!
Sergeant Horvath!

16
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:41,140
Move your men off the beach! Now!

17
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:45,016
Okay, you guys, get on my ass!
Follow me!

18
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:50,253
Sir! What's the rallying point?
Anywhere but here!

19
00:11:01,673 --> 00:11:05,905
What now, sir?
The seawall, move up to the seawall!

20
00:11:06,077 --> 00:11:10,275
Sir, I'm staying!
Clear the beach to make way.

21
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:13,077
This is all we've got
between us and the Almighty.

22
00:11:13,251 --> 00:11:18,188
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted.

23
00:11:18,356 --> 00:11:21,154
You stay here, you're dead men!

24
00:11:34,773 --> 00:11:38,368
Mama, Mama!

25
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:45,608
Stay down, stay down!

26
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:54,148
What are you guys?
104th Medical Battalion, sir.

27
00:11:54,326 --> 00:11:58,490
We're here to set up field operations.
Get rid of that crap!

28
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:01,996
Grab yourselves some weapons
and follow me.

29
00:12:09,374 --> 00:12:11,501
I'm hit!
Briggs!

30
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:18,580
Medic!

31
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,186
I'm hit low! God!
Medic!

32
00:12:22,354 --> 00:12:23,912
Navy Beach Battalion, sir!

33
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:27,820
I've got to clear these obstacles.
Make holes for the tanks!

34
00:12:27,993 --> 00:12:30,985
The armour is floundering at sea.
Orders, sir!

35
00:12:31,162 --> 00:12:33,562
Go somewhere else!
I'm clearing this one.

36
00:12:33,732 --> 00:12:34,994
Come on, Briggs!

37
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:42,734
Medic!

38
00:12:42,908 --> 00:12:44,239
Medic!

39
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,843
Move, move!

40
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:31,047
Come on, move!

41
00:13:38,363 --> 00:13:40,763
Move, move!

42
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:55,911
Shore party!
No armour has made it ashore.

43
00:13:56,081 --> 00:14:00,882
We've got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open!

44
00:14:01,786 --> 00:14:04,050
Who's in command here?

45
00:14:04,222 --> 00:14:06,053
You are, sir!

46
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:11,588
Sergeant Horvath?
Do you recognize where we are?

47
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:13,993
Where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is.

48
00:14:14,165 --> 00:14:17,532
Nobody's where
they're supposed to be!

49
00:14:17,702 --> 00:14:19,932
Shore party!

50
00:14:20,105 --> 00:14:23,472
First wave ineffective!
We do not hold the beach.

51
00:14:23,642 --> 00:14:26,736
Say again, we do not hold the beach!

52
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:32,076
We're mixed up! We've got people from
Fox, Able and George companies.

53
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:36,778
Plus, we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster.

54
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:40,516
Shore party, Shore party!

55
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:49,194
CAT-F, CAT-F, CA...

56
00:14:52,604 --> 00:14:54,629
Reiben here.
Seen anybody else?

57
00:14:54,806 --> 00:14:57,331
Jackson, but that's it.
Mellish here!

58
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:00,637
Caparzo! We've got DeForest
back there with Wade!

59
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:06,374
D.'s hurt so bad he's sprung a hundred
leaks! Wade says he's used up!

60
00:15:06,551 --> 00:15:11,579
Move on to somebody you can help.
Let go, he's a battalion surgeon!

61
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,954
Get his attention!
Wade!

62
00:15:18,129 --> 00:15:20,996
Wade!
Wade!

63
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:25,603
Wade, don't do it!
It's too risky, too risky, Doc!

64
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:28,000
Get your ass back here!

65
00:15:28,173 --> 00:15:30,004
Get him off the beach.

66
00:15:30,175 --> 00:15:33,838
I've got it! We've stopped the bleeding!

67
00:15:35,213 --> 00:15:36,441
Fuck!

68
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:40,277
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

69
00:15:40,452 --> 00:15:42,920
Wade, come on!
You son of a fucking cocksucker!

70
00:15:43,088 --> 00:15:46,922
Wade, it's Mellish. Wade!

71
00:15:47,092 --> 00:15:50,084
Let's move! We found Miller!
Let's move!

72
00:15:50,261 --> 00:15:51,785
Fuck it!

73
00:15:51,963 --> 00:15:54,488
Get down, get down!

74
00:15:59,471 --> 00:16:02,497
This is all?
This is all that's made it?

75
00:16:02,674 --> 00:16:06,940
We got scattered pretty bad.
There's bound to be more of us.

76
00:16:07,112 --> 00:16:08,636
It's not enough.

77
00:16:08,813 --> 00:16:11,907
Dog One exit.
It's the cut to the right, or was it left?

78
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:16,247
No. Vierville is to the left.
This is Dog One.

79
00:16:16,421 --> 00:16:21,916
They're killing us and we don't have
a fucking chance! That ain't fair!

80
00:16:22,093 --> 00:16:26,393
Gather weapons and ammo!
Gather weapons and ammo!

81
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,340
Reiben! Where's your BAR?

82
00:16:41,513 --> 00:16:44,004
Bottom of the Channel.
The bitch tried to drown me.

83
00:16:44,182 --> 00:16:46,047
Find a replacement.

84
00:16:48,486 --> 00:16:51,182
Bangalores!
Bring out some bangalores!

85
00:16:51,356 --> 00:16:56,191
Engineers coming!
Grenades, give me grenades!

86
00:16:59,063 --> 00:17:02,829
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

87
00:17:03,001 --> 00:17:07,700
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!
Come on, come on!

88
00:17:07,872 --> 00:17:11,137
Jackson here, sir!
Reiben back, sir.

89
00:17:11,309 --> 00:17:13,675
Oh, my God!

90
00:17:13,845 --> 00:17:17,281
Mortars incoming!

91
00:17:17,448 --> 00:17:19,814
One more, give me one more!

92
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:27,820
Oh, my God, it hurts!
I'm going to die!

93
00:17:27,992 --> 00:17:31,325
Oh, my God! Jesus!
Oh, my God!

94
00:17:31,496 --> 00:17:34,363
Come on, put it in. Keep it moving.

95
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:36,227
We've got it.

96
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:39,268
Jesus! Lucky bastard.

97
00:17:40,205 --> 00:17:42,469
Move it! Keep it moving!

98
00:17:46,277 --> 00:17:51,374
You're not going to die. You're fine.
Just don't look at it. Don't look at it!

99
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:55,280
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

100
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:57,921
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!

101
00:17:58,089 --> 00:17:59,954
Fire in the hole!

102
00:18:01,826 --> 00:18:03,851
Fire in the hole!

103
00:18:13,238 --> 00:18:16,935
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

104
00:18:27,452 --> 00:18:30,012
Give him some morphine.

105
00:18:30,188 --> 00:18:32,088
That's it, let's go.

106
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:38,091
Inspected, morphine.

107
00:18:40,665 --> 00:18:42,690
Routine.

108
00:18:48,206 --> 00:18:50,003
Priority.

109
00:19:07,692 --> 00:19:11,287
Son of a bitch! Get in there.

110
00:19:11,462 --> 00:19:14,522
Fuck, I can't move!
Mellish, give me your bayonet.

111
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,792
Sarge.

112
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:40,017
Two MG-42s, two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

113
00:19:43,261 --> 00:19:47,163
There's defilade, but it's a good firing
position if we can land the armour.

114
00:19:47,332 --> 00:19:50,324
We've got to get this draw open!

115
00:19:50,501 --> 00:19:55,495
Reiben, Mellish! Let's get in the war!
Take cover and put fire on that crew.

116
00:19:55,673 --> 00:19:59,905
Davis, DeBernardo, Young, Valk!
Get ready!

117
00:20:01,646 --> 00:20:03,045
Covering fire!

118
00:20:06,751 --> 00:20:08,844
Go, go, go!

119
00:20:22,266 --> 00:20:24,393
It's a goddam firing squad.

120
00:20:24,569 --> 00:20:27,402
It's the only way
we can get everybody out of here.

121
00:20:27,572 --> 00:20:31,872
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

122
00:20:32,043 --> 00:20:34,477
Why not just
hand out blindfolds, Captain?

123
00:20:34,645 --> 00:20:38,911
All we can do here is die!
Covering fire!

124
00:20:40,518 --> 00:20:42,486
Go, go, go!

125
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:47,218
Come on, come on, come on!
Go, God damm it!

126
00:20:59,771 --> 00:21:02,205
Jackson.
Sir.

127
00:21:03,274 --> 00:21:07,438
That impact crater should give you
defilade from the machine gun position.

128
00:21:07,612 --> 00:21:11,708
Get in there and give me some
fire discipline. Wait for my command.

129
00:21:17,088 --> 00:21:19,181
Go!

130
00:21:29,634 --> 00:21:32,933
If your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

131
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:35,834
I thought you were my mother.

132
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:38,703
Be not Thou far from me, O Lord.

133
00:21:43,448 --> 00:21:48,579
Oh, my God. I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

134
00:21:48,753 --> 00:21:53,554
I detest my sins for having offended
Thee, O Lord. Listen to me, Lord.

135
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:03,894
All my strength!
Haste Thee to help me.

136
00:22:19,217 --> 00:22:22,653
Dog One exit, right here!

137
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,344
We're in business!

138
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:27,882
Move, move!

139
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:10,460
Reiben.
Go, Sarge!

140
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:12,296
Reiben!

141
00:23:40,865 --> 00:23:42,696
Come on, Doyle!

142
00:23:44,068 --> 00:23:45,899
Sarge!

143
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:53,767
Flame! Doyle, do it!

144
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,909
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

145
00:24:17,368 --> 00:24:19,529
On the right!

146
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,373
I'll give you "comrade",
you son of a bitch!

147
00:24:25,543 --> 00:24:29,411
Look out! Turn around, turn around.

148
00:24:50,568 --> 00:24:52,627
Flush them out!

149
00:24:56,274 --> 00:25:00,677
Cease fire, cease fire!
Cut it out, cut it out!

150
00:25:00,845 --> 00:25:02,312
Cease fire!

151
00:25:02,947 --> 00:25:07,043
Sugar Cane, Sugar Charlie Three.
Say again, Dog One is open.

152
00:25:07,218 --> 00:25:11,746
Send in the dozers.
I'm waiting here to tie in my flanks.

153
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:13,355
What?

154
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,690
What? I'm sorry,
I can't understand what you're saying!

155
00:25:27,638 --> 00:25:30,198
What did he say, what did he say?

156
00:25:30,374 --> 00:25:33,366
Look, I washed for supper!

157
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:39,039
Who's got a bazooka, goddammit?

158
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:50,256
Hey, Fish.
Look at this, a Hitler Youth knife.

159
00:25:51,962 --> 00:25:54,658
And now it's a Shabbat
challah cutter, right?

160
00:26:04,909 --> 00:26:06,900
Keep it moving!

161
00:27:06,904 --> 00:27:09,498
That's quite a view.

162
00:27:09,673 --> 00:27:11,766
Yes, it is.

163
00:27:13,010 --> 00:27:14,978
Quite a view.

164
00:28:49,206 --> 00:28:54,303
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd. No doubt by now
you have received full information"-

165
00:28:54,478 --> 00:28:55,809
"about the untimely death
of your son."

166
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:58,676
"No words can ever
relieve your grief."

167
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:01,477
"Our outfiit has felt his loss greatly..."
"He was a fiine soldier"-

168
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:04,711
"and believed strongly in
what we were doing..."

169
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:07,881
"We were involved in one of the
most important operations of the war."

170
00:29:08,058 --> 00:29:10,583
"Al was the one
who held us all together."

171
00:29:10,761 --> 00:29:12,388
"He was the first to volunteer."

172
00:29:12,563 --> 00:29:15,623
"We passed a road
where over 4,000 troops had passed."

173
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:20,827
"Your husband served in a unit
whose duty is to place itself beyond..."

174
00:29:21,005 --> 00:29:23,906
"...which we all cherish
and hold dear..."

175
00:29:24,074 --> 00:29:27,703
"The loss of Lee and others like him
is a distinct blow to the regiment."

176
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:30,813
"We understand your
desire to learn about"-

177
00:29:30,981 --> 00:29:34,007
"the circumstances
leading to his death."

178
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:29,195
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

179
00:30:31,208 --> 00:30:34,302
These two men died in Normandy.

180
00:30:34,478 --> 00:30:38,608
This one at Omaha Beach.
"Sean Ryan."

181
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:43,813
This man at Utah.
"Peter Ryan."

182
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:50,791
This man was killed last week
in New Guinea.

183
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:56,299
"Daniel Ryan."

184
00:30:56,934 --> 00:30:58,902
They are brothers.

185
00:30:59,069 --> 00:31:04,166
This afternoon their mother
is going to get all three telegrams.

186
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:11,544
There's also a fourth brother who
parachuted in with 101st Airborne -

187
00:31:11,715 --> 00:31:15,048
the night before the invasion.
He is somewhere in Normandy.

188
00:31:15,219 --> 00:31:17,619
Is he alive?
We don't know.

189
00:31:21,525 --> 00:31:23,459
Come with me.

190
00:33:07,197 --> 00:33:09,961
Goddammit.

191
00:33:10,134 --> 00:33:13,626
All four were in the same company
in the 29th Division -

192
00:33:13,804 --> 00:33:16,500
but we split them up after the Sullivan
brothers died on the Juneau.

193
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:19,870
Any contact with
the fourth son, James?

194
00:33:20,043 --> 00:33:25,413
No. He was dropped 15 miles inland
near Neuville, behind German lines.

195
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:30,679
Mac, there is no way
you can know where he was dropped.

196
00:33:30,854 --> 00:33:34,813
First report from lke's people at
SHAEF said the 101st is scattered.

197
00:33:34,992 --> 00:33:37,153
There are misdrops
all over Normandy.

198
00:33:37,327 --> 00:33:41,627
Assuming Private Ryan even survived
the jump, he could be anywhere.

199
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:43,926
In fact, he's probably K.I.A.

200
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:47,628
And frankly, if we go sending
some sort of rescue mission, -

201
00:33:47,805 --> 00:33:51,673
flat-hatting throughout German
reinforcements along our advance, -

202
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:54,777
they're going to be K.I. A, too.

203
00:34:16,767 --> 00:34:18,462
I have a letter here...

204
00:34:20,304 --> 00:34:26,368
...written a long time ago to a
Mrs Bixby in Boston. So bear with me.

205
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:30,374
"Dear Madam."

206
00:34:31,615 --> 00:34:35,711
"I have been shown in the files of
the War Department a statement" -

207
00:34:35,886 --> 00:34:37,683
"of the Adjutant General
of Massachusetts" -

208
00:34:37,855 --> 00:34:41,450
'that you are the mother of five..."

209
00:34:43,861 --> 00:34:47,922
"...sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle."

210
00:34:50,267 --> 00:34:55,000
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine" -

211
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:58,699
'that would attempt to
beguile you from the grief' -

212
00:34:58,876 --> 00:35:02,175
"of a loss so overwhelming..."

213
00:35:02,346 --> 00:35:08,080
"...but I can't refrain from tendering
the consolation that may be found" -

214
00:35:08,252 --> 00:35:12,951
"in the thanks of
the republic they died to save."

215
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:21,187
"May our Heavenly Father assuage
the anguish of your bereavement" -

216
00:35:21,365 --> 00:35:26,598
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved and lost" -

217
00:35:26,770 --> 00:35:30,501
"and the solemn pride that must be
yours to have laid such a sacrifice" -

218
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:36,340
"upon the altar of freedom.
Yours very sincerely and respectfully," -

219
00:35:36,513 --> 00:35:38,743
"Abraham Lincoln."

220
00:35:57,501 --> 00:36:03,770
That boy is alive. We are going to
send somebody to find him.

221
00:36:03,941 --> 00:36:07,968
And we are going to get him
the hell out of there.

222
00:36:19,556 --> 00:36:24,687
The Quartermaster's up the beach
a way. Look for a blown-up bunker.

223
00:36:24,861 --> 00:36:28,126
Miller, Charlie Company.
Go on in, Captain.

224
00:36:28,298 --> 00:36:31,324
If we don't off-load
the Shermans by 0600 -

225
00:36:31,501 --> 00:36:36,404
we'll have a division stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.

226
00:36:36,573 --> 00:36:38,871
Well, you let me know of it.

227
00:36:39,042 --> 00:36:42,341
Let Charlie Company hold at Vierville
'til we can get the armour there.

228
00:36:42,512 --> 00:36:44,173
Runner!

229
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:53,883
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for us, but misdropped, -

230
00:36:54,057 --> 00:36:56,924
and scattered all their sticks into
the wind. What's your situation?

231
00:36:57,094 --> 00:37:00,188
Yes, sir... Sector Four is secure.

232
00:37:00,364 --> 00:37:07,327
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

233
00:37:07,504 --> 00:37:10,302
They got four Shermans
and some deuce-and-a-halves.

234
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:13,443
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

235
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:17,512
We went up the middle of it, but it
turned into a mixed high-density field.

236
00:37:17,681 --> 00:37:20,809
A little bit of everything;
Sprengmine 44s, Schumne 42s, -

237
00:37:20,984 --> 00:37:26,354
pot mines, A-200s, the little wooden
bastard the detectors don't pick up.

238
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:32,086
Here, they placed big mushrooms,
Teller mine 43s, I guess for our tanks, -

239
00:37:32,262 --> 00:37:35,561
from here right up to the edge
of the village, right here.

240
00:37:35,732 --> 00:37:37,791
We marked them
and called the engineers.

241
00:37:37,968 --> 00:37:41,495
Resistance?
We had higher support expectations.

242
00:37:41,671 --> 00:37:46,040
There was a company without artillery.
Wehrmacht. 346th Infantry.

243
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:49,372
Von Lucke Kampfgruppe.
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

244
00:37:49,546 --> 00:37:52,037
We turned them over to MPs
from the 29th.

245
00:37:55,318 --> 00:37:58,082
What about our casualties?

246
00:37:58,255 --> 00:38:05,320
Well, the figure is...
We're 35 dead, times two wounded.

247
00:38:05,495 --> 00:38:09,488
They just didn't want to
give up those 88s.

248
00:38:10,567 --> 00:38:13,297
It was a tough assignment.
That was why you got it.

249
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,870
Yes, sir.

250
00:38:16,039 --> 00:38:18,007
John...

251
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:23,212
I've got another one for you.
Yes, sir.

252
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,575
It's straight from the top.

253
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,181
I wish. You and I are taking a squad
to Neuville on a PR mission.

254
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:38,452
Oh, are you leading a squad?

255
00:38:38,628 --> 00:38:42,928
A private in the 101st lost three
brothers and he's got a ticket home.

256
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,295
Why Neuville?
They think he's there.

257
00:38:45,469 --> 00:38:48,404
Part of all those Airborne misdrops.

258
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:52,702
It won't be easy finding one soldier
in the middle of this goddam war.

259
00:38:52,876 --> 00:38:54,935
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

260
00:38:55,112 --> 00:38:56,636
What about the company?

261
00:38:56,813 --> 00:38:59,976
We take the pick of the litter,
the rest goes to Baker.

262
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,246
Jesus Christ!
They took away your company?

263
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:08,551
It wasn't mine, it was the Army's.
So they told me, anyway.

264
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:12,559
Get me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

265
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:15,789
Beasley's dead.
Alright, Mellish then.

266
00:39:15,966 --> 00:39:18,833
Do have a guy who speaks French?
Not that I know of.

267
00:39:19,936 --> 00:39:23,269
What about Talbot?
This morning.

268
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,534
I'm going to
try and dig up another interpreter.

269
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,770
Assemble at the battalion
motor pool on the beach.

270
00:39:29,946 --> 00:39:32,414
What are we going to do?
Listen up. What?

271
00:39:32,582 --> 00:39:36,382
Go home wrapped in the American
flag with a hunk of cheese in your ass.

272
00:39:36,553 --> 00:39:39,784
I thought you liked it in the ass.
What?

273
00:39:39,956 --> 00:39:42,390
Attention!

274
00:39:42,559 --> 00:39:45,187
As you were. I'm looking for
Corporal Timothy Upham.

275
00:39:45,362 --> 00:39:47,387
Yes, I'm Upham.

276
00:39:47,564 --> 00:39:49,759
Do you speak French and German?
Yes, sir.

277
00:39:49,933 --> 00:39:51,958
How's your accent?
Slight one in French.

278
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:54,262
My German's clean.
Very good.

279
00:39:54,437 --> 00:39:58,168
You've been re-assigned to me.
Grab your gear, we're going to Neuville.

280
00:39:58,341 --> 00:40:01,799
When was this updated?
As of 8:30 this morning.

281
00:40:01,978 --> 00:40:05,209
This is the 12th SS Panzer. These are
the two axes advancing south.

282
00:40:05,382 --> 00:40:10,410
There are Germans in Neuville.
I understand, Corporal.

283
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:14,284
There are a lot of Germans in Neuville.
You've got a problem with that?

284
00:40:14,457 --> 00:40:17,984
Please consider that I've never been
in combat. I make maps and translate.

285
00:40:18,161 --> 00:40:21,392
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

286
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:25,695
My two guys were killed.
I haven't held a weapon since training.

287
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:28,337
Did you fire the weapon
in Basic training?

288
00:40:28,505 --> 00:40:31,963
Yes, sir.
Well, then get your gear.

289
00:40:33,743 --> 00:40:35,540
Sir, may I bring...

290
00:40:39,716 --> 00:40:41,980
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

291
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,187
Yes, sir.

292
00:40:51,861 --> 00:40:53,658
Thank you very much.

293
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,957
Is that a souvenir?
No, sir.

294
00:40:56,132 --> 00:40:57,929
Take your time.

295
00:41:02,672 --> 00:41:05,266
You should look on
the bright side of things, Corporal.

296
00:41:05,442 --> 00:41:09,640
Yes.
For one thing, you don't need those.

297
00:41:09,813 --> 00:41:13,909
You'll need that.
Yes. I'll need this, not that.

298
00:42:11,141 --> 00:42:12,335
Hey!
Hey!

299
00:42:12,509 --> 00:42:14,773
You want your head blown off?

300
00:42:14,944 --> 00:42:19,847
Don't touch me with those rat claws
again. Get the fuck back in formation!

301
00:42:21,418 --> 00:42:23,852
I was just wondering
where you're from.

302
00:42:29,659 --> 00:42:32,457
Caparzo, is it?
Drop dead, Corporal.

303
00:42:32,629 --> 00:42:33,857
Gotcha.

304
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:37,693
Every time you salute the Captain,
you make him a target for the Germans.

305
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:39,801
I'm sorry.
Do us a favour. Don't do it.

306
00:42:39,969 --> 00:42:42,631
Especially when
I'm standing next to him. Capisci?

307
00:42:42,806 --> 00:42:45,934
Capisco.
Corporal, what's your book about?

308
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:47,440
Watch your rifle.
Sorry.

309
00:42:47,610 --> 00:42:52,570
It's about the brotherhood that
develops between soldiers during war.

310
00:42:52,749 --> 00:42:56,412
Brotherhood? What do you know
about brotherhood?

311
00:42:56,586 --> 00:42:58,645
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

312
00:42:58,822 --> 00:43:01,416
Why don't you ask the Captain
where he's from?

313
00:43:01,591 --> 00:43:05,027
Ask the Captain. He'll tell you
everything you want to know about him.

314
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:08,463
Explain the maths of this to me.

315
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:12,590
Where is the sense in risking the lives
of the eight of us to save one guy?

316
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:15,738
20 degrees.
Anybody wants to answer that?

317
00:43:15,905 --> 00:43:19,033
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

318
00:43:19,209 --> 00:43:21,370
Hey, Doc, I've got a mother.

319
00:43:21,544 --> 00:43:23,910
You've got a mother,
Sarge has got a mother.

320
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,607
Shit, I bet
even the Captain's got a mother.

321
00:43:27,784 --> 00:43:30,582
Maybe not the Captain,
but the rest of us.

322
00:43:30,754 --> 00:43:33,086
"Their's is not to reason why
their's is but to do and die"

323
00:43:33,256 --> 00:43:37,590
La-la-la... What the fuck
is that supposed to mean, Corporal?

324
00:43:37,761 --> 00:43:39,126
We're all supposed to die?

325
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:42,992
Upham's talking about our duty.
Yes, sir.

326
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,963
We all have orders to follow.

327
00:43:47,604 --> 00:43:51,540
Yes, sir. Thank you.
Even if the mission is "FUBAR"?

328
00:43:51,708 --> 00:43:54,233
Especially if the mission is "FUBAR".

329
00:43:54,878 --> 00:43:58,644
What's "FUBAR"?
It's German.

330
00:43:58,815 --> 00:44:00,976
Never heard of that...

331
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:05,315
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

332
00:44:05,488 --> 00:44:08,218
By all means,
share it with the squad.

333
00:44:08,391 --> 00:44:10,655
From my way of thinking, -

334
00:44:10,827 --> 00:44:15,628
this mission is a misallocation
of valuable military resources.

335
00:44:15,799 --> 00:44:17,664
Yeah? Go on.

336
00:44:17,834 --> 00:44:23,466
It seems to me that God
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

337
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:27,508
Reiben, pay attention. Now, this is
the way to gripe. Continue, Jackson.

338
00:44:27,677 --> 00:44:33,138
If He was to put me and this sniper rifle
anywhere up to and including -

339
00:44:33,316 --> 00:44:36,547
one mile of Adolf Hitler
with a clear line of sight, sir...

340
00:44:36,719 --> 00:44:39,984
Pack your bags, fellas,
the war is over. Amen.

341
00:44:40,156 --> 00:44:42,420
That's brilliant, bumpkin.

342
00:44:42,592 --> 00:44:45,459
What about you, Captain?
You don't gripe at all?

343
00:44:45,628 --> 00:44:48,927
I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain.
There's a chain of command.

344
00:44:49,098 --> 00:44:50,929
Gripe always go up.

345
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,935
You gripe to me, I gripe to
my superior officers, and so on.

346
00:44:56,105 --> 00:45:00,007
I don't gripe in front of you.
You should know that as a Ranger.

347
00:45:00,176 --> 00:45:04,875
I'm sorry, but let's say that you weren't
a captain or that I was a major.

348
00:45:05,048 --> 00:45:06,811
What would you say?

349
00:45:06,983 --> 00:45:10,919
In that case, I'd say,
"This is an excellent mission" -

350
00:45:11,087 --> 00:45:15,547
"with a valuable objective
worthy of my best efforts."

351
00:45:15,725 --> 00:45:21,322
"Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private Ryan" -

352
00:45:21,498 --> 00:45:26,800
"and I'll lay down my life and those of
my men, especially yours, Reiben," -

353
00:45:26,970 --> 00:45:28,494
'to ease her suffering."

354
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:32,239
He's good.
I love him.

355
00:45:42,652 --> 00:45:44,483
Fine!

356
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:28,858
Thunder!
Flash!

357
00:46:29,032 --> 00:46:32,866
Upham, over there.
Reiben, you four go.

358
00:46:41,744 --> 00:46:43,644
Go, go, go, go!

359
00:46:49,185 --> 00:46:52,154
You are a sight for sore eyes.
Sergeant Hill, our reliefs showed up.

360
00:46:52,322 --> 00:46:56,452
How many are you?
Eight. We're not your relief. Sorry.

361
00:46:56,626 --> 00:46:59,925
What do you mean, sir?
We're here for a Private Ryan.

362
00:47:00,096 --> 00:47:02,564
Who?
Ryan? What for?

363
00:47:02,799 --> 00:47:06,064
Is he here?
Maybe on the other side of the town.

364
00:47:06,235 --> 00:47:08,760
It's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our centre.

365
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:11,907
They cut us right in two.
What's his name, again?

366
00:47:12,075 --> 00:47:15,203
Ryan, James Ryan.
He dropped in with the 101st.

367
00:47:15,378 --> 00:47:18,438
Goldman, get me a runner!
Runner!

368
00:47:18,615 --> 00:47:20,549
Come on!

369
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,654
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

370
00:47:28,291 --> 00:47:31,260
We got stopped by fire
from the eastward.

371
00:47:31,427 --> 00:47:35,090
The Germans have been reinforcing
two regiments all day.

372
00:47:35,264 --> 00:47:37,357
It's been quiet for 45 minutes.

373
00:47:37,533 --> 00:47:40,001
The Germans concentrate
their fire westward.

374
00:47:40,169 --> 00:47:43,502
Who's that on the loudspeaker?
Dagwood Duesseldorf.

375
00:47:43,673 --> 00:47:48,201
Our friendly
neighbourhood morale officer.

376
00:47:48,378 --> 00:47:51,677
"The Statue of Liberty is kaputt."

377
00:47:51,848 --> 00:47:54,248
That's disconcerting.

378
00:47:58,688 --> 00:48:02,954
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

379
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:07,820
Cover!

380
00:48:14,704 --> 00:48:16,433
Go!

381
00:48:39,529 --> 00:48:42,293
You sadistic fucking animals!
Get down.

382
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:45,366
They know we're not in direct contact.
They'll single out the runners.

383
00:48:45,535 --> 00:48:47,127
Why do they shoot them up?

384
00:48:47,303 --> 00:48:50,898
As long as his lungs are working, he
carries the message. We'd do the same.

385
00:48:51,074 --> 00:48:54,635
No, we wouldn't!
Wade! Get them ready to travel.

386
00:48:54,811 --> 00:48:56,676
Boyd!
Come on!

387
00:48:56,846 --> 00:48:59,542
Try again! Let Captain Hamill
know we're coming.

388
00:48:59,716 --> 00:49:02,014
What's the rest of Neuville like?

389
00:49:02,185 --> 00:49:06,019
The next block's got
two-storey buildings. A lot of windows.

390
00:49:06,189 --> 00:49:08,282
There's a square with good cover.

391
00:49:08,458 --> 00:49:10,892
Show me.
Sarge, hold right here!

392
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:12,527
Yes, sir!

393
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:19,327
Stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

394
00:49:19,502 --> 00:49:22,471
Try a left hook. Shoot and scoot.
Two of yours, two of mine.

395
00:49:22,638 --> 00:49:25,163
Hastings, Goldman! Up front!

396
00:49:26,275 --> 00:49:28,971
Reiben, Caparzo.
They're still jamming us.

397
00:49:29,145 --> 00:49:32,239
Short runs, high and low at the corners.
It's going to be tight.

398
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,815
Be prepared for close contact. Go.

399
00:49:34,984 --> 00:49:37,475
Upham!
You stay with Sergeant Horvath.

400
00:49:37,653 --> 00:49:41,714
Stay here! I'll wear him like
underwear, Captain. You stay with me.

401
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,801
Past the end of the block
are the gates of the square.

402
00:49:52,969 --> 00:49:54,960
Good.
Alright.

403
00:50:02,311 --> 00:50:04,074
Reiben, where's the Captain from?

404
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:08,013
If you figure it out, you'll get a prize.
300 bucks, last I heard.

405
00:50:08,184 --> 00:50:11,711
The company's got a pool.
Five bucks gets you in.

406
00:50:18,728 --> 00:50:22,289
It's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

407
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,132
Somebody must know
where he's from.

408
00:50:26,302 --> 00:50:29,294
I've been with him since
Casserene Pass. I don't have a clue.

409
00:50:29,472 --> 00:50:34,341
My ankles are killing me. I'll need
a wheelchair before the war is over.

410
00:50:34,510 --> 00:50:38,810
That's it! Oh, my God!
That ankle is like an old woman.

411
00:50:38,981 --> 00:50:42,382
Like an old...
Oh, God!

412
00:50:43,653 --> 00:50:46,918
Reiben. So you don't even know
where he went to school?

413
00:50:47,089 --> 00:50:51,355
He didn't go to school. They assembled
him at OCS out of dead Gls.

414
00:50:51,527 --> 00:50:54,894
Pay attention to detail. I know
where he's from and what he did -

415
00:50:55,064 --> 00:50:57,191
because I pay attention to detail.

416
00:50:57,366 --> 00:51:00,665
Hey, Upham!
Careful you don't step in the bullshit.

417
00:51:06,175 --> 00:51:08,473
Do it.
Thunder!

418
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:11,204
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

419
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,406
Mellish, Caparzo, come here!

420
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:24,057
Tell them to show themselves.

421
00:51:35,905 --> 00:51:38,635
Ask them where the Germans are.

422
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:45,340
What is he saying?
Something about the children.

423
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:47,709
Kids?
He wants us to take them.

424
00:51:47,884 --> 00:51:49,647
No, no. We can't take the kids.

425
00:51:49,819 --> 00:51:55,348
We can't take the kids!
No, no!

426
00:51:57,526 --> 00:52:00,518
They think they'll be safe.
They won't be safe with us!

427
00:52:01,998 --> 00:52:04,489
Are you nuts? Listen to the Captain!

428
00:52:05,067 --> 00:52:07,001
They think they'll be safe with us.

429
00:52:07,169 --> 00:52:12,630
It's not safe anywhere.
Caparzo! Put that kid back!

430
00:52:14,377 --> 00:52:17,346
Caparzo, put the girl back!
It's OK, it's OK.

431
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:19,708
Give that kid back!

432
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:24,616
Upham, how do you say, "It's OK?"
I can't. She reminds me of my niece.

433
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:26,755
Get the kid back up there!

434
00:52:26,923 --> 00:52:30,381
We should at least take her
to the next town.

435
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,653
We're not here to do that,
we're here to follow orders!

436
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:36,992
Sarge, take this goddam kid!

437
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:39,862
Cover, cover!

438
00:52:47,343 --> 00:52:48,571
No!

439
00:52:48,744 --> 00:52:50,678
Goddammit!
Where did that come from?

440
00:52:53,316 --> 00:52:56,444
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

441
00:53:01,691 --> 00:53:03,682
That's where I'd be.

442
00:53:05,361 --> 00:53:09,422
I didn't see it.
450 yards, maybe a shade under.

443
00:53:09,598 --> 00:53:13,398
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas.
This sniper's got talent!

444
00:53:18,007 --> 00:53:22,944
Please don't cry. I'll take you back
to Mama and Papa. Please don't cry.

445
00:53:23,112 --> 00:53:24,443
Come on.

446
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:28,344
Carpy!

447
00:53:39,762 --> 00:53:42,731
Captain!
Hold on, Caparzo.

448
00:53:43,666 --> 00:53:45,657
Help me up. I can walk.

449
00:53:45,835 --> 00:53:47,496
Caparzo, stay still!

450
00:53:59,348 --> 00:54:02,249
Two clicks. Left wind.

451
00:54:05,421 --> 00:54:07,286
Fish!

452
00:54:14,597 --> 00:54:17,191
Captain, can you see him?
How is he?

453
00:54:17,366 --> 00:54:19,493
Wade, you stay put.

454
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:21,863
Where is he shot, Captain?

455
00:54:23,572 --> 00:54:25,938
Can you see him?
You stay there!

456
00:54:26,108 --> 00:54:28,508
Damn it! Stay down!

457
00:54:28,677 --> 00:54:33,341
What's the matter with you? Am I
going to take care of you if you get hit?

458
00:54:33,516 --> 00:54:35,381
Fish, come over here!

459
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:39,180
Carpy, put your head down!
Why can't you put your head down?

460
00:54:47,696 --> 00:54:50,893
Oh, my God, I trust in Thee.

461
00:54:51,067 --> 00:54:56,903
Let me not be ashamed.
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

462
00:55:06,082 --> 00:55:10,382
Copy it.
Copy it and send it for me.

463
00:55:10,553 --> 00:55:13,147
You're going to
send it yourself. Put it down!

464
00:55:13,322 --> 00:55:15,313
It's got blood on it!
I see it.

465
00:55:20,096 --> 00:55:24,829
It's... It's to my dad.
It's got blood on it, Fish.

466
00:55:53,229 --> 00:55:55,595
We got him. Stay down.

467
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,876
How bad is it?
Chest, maybe lung shot.

468
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:26,560
Get that.30 up the street!

469
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,893
Detail!
Clear, up!

470
00:56:34,069 --> 00:56:35,661
Clear, down!

471
00:56:50,553 --> 00:56:53,147
That's why we can't take children.

472
00:56:59,495 --> 00:57:02,987
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

473
00:57:03,165 --> 00:57:06,657
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

474
00:57:07,436 --> 00:57:09,165
Sergeant Hill.
Yes, sir.

475
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:13,570
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.

476
00:57:13,742 --> 00:57:15,334
Jackson.
Sir!

477
00:57:15,511 --> 00:57:20,676
Mellish. Check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now, go!

478
00:57:31,994 --> 00:57:33,928
Fuck Ryan!

479
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,472
Thunder!
Flash! Come on in!

480
00:57:53,082 --> 00:57:55,346
Hey, guys.
We're looking for Captain Hamill.

481
00:57:55,517 --> 00:57:58,350
Down there, across the square.
Across the square.

482
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,715
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

483
00:58:02,124 --> 00:58:03,921
Sit down.

484
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:22,738
Jimmy T. Go and find
Captain Hamill. Bring him here.

485
00:58:22,911 --> 00:58:26,904
What? Up there?
How should I know? Go and look!

486
00:58:27,082 --> 00:58:28,879
Thank you, you moron.

487
00:58:30,519 --> 00:58:35,650
Alright. You guys just
flake out here for a while.

488
00:58:37,293 --> 00:58:40,922
Let me get this goddam hitchhiker
out of my boot.

489
00:58:51,106 --> 00:58:54,906
Put your weapons down!
Drop them now!

490
00:58:58,947 --> 00:59:00,778
I'll shoot you!

491
00:59:00,949 --> 00:59:02,382
Drop, drop 'em!

492
00:59:05,521 --> 00:59:07,284
Put 'em down!

493
00:59:22,871 --> 00:59:24,498
Clear, up!

494
00:59:29,678 --> 00:59:32,078
Shit, shit!

495
00:59:32,247 --> 00:59:34,579
Clear, up!

496
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:36,718
Clear, down!

497
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:50,097
Enough to make you old.

498
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:52,661
Let's hope so.

499
01:00:02,778 --> 01:00:06,612
Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.
Miller, 2nd Rangers.

500
01:00:06,782 --> 01:00:09,342
Thank you.

501
01:00:09,518 --> 01:00:12,009
We're looking for a Private Ryan.
He's part of your outfit.

502
01:00:12,187 --> 01:00:14,246
Any chance that you policed him up?

503
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:19,783
How was the road in?
Scenic. We lost most of our ammo.

504
01:00:19,962 --> 01:00:21,953
Not to mention one of our men.

505
01:00:22,131 --> 01:00:26,431
Lieutenant! Redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

506
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,866
And get Ryan up here!

507
01:00:30,739 --> 01:00:35,608
Ryan! Ryan!
Front and centre! Ryan!

508
01:00:39,281 --> 01:00:41,545
Here comes our boy.

509
01:00:48,757 --> 01:00:50,816
I told you he was an asshole.

510
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:55,557
Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
At ease.

511
01:00:55,731 --> 01:00:59,531
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers,
wants a word with you.

512
01:01:00,769 --> 01:01:02,964
This way.

513
01:01:03,138 --> 01:01:06,403
Alright. Take a knee.

514
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:17,783
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

515
01:01:26,562 --> 01:01:30,658
Well, there isn't
any really easy way to say this, so...

516
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:35,935
...so I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

517
01:01:37,206 --> 01:01:41,870
We have orders to come and get you...

518
01:01:42,044 --> 01:01:44,103
...because you're going home.

519
01:01:58,193 --> 01:02:00,320
Oh, my God! My brothers are dead!

520
01:02:08,270 --> 01:02:12,104
I was going to take them fishing
when we got home.

521
01:02:25,654 --> 01:02:29,886
I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

522
01:02:30,058 --> 01:02:35,496
How did they die?
They were killed in action.

523
01:02:37,533 --> 01:02:39,694
That can't be.

524
01:02:41,537 --> 01:02:44,995
They can't be my brothers.
They're still in grammar school.

525
01:02:47,976 --> 01:02:51,377
You're James Ryan?
Yeah.

526
01:02:52,047 --> 01:02:54,675
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

527
01:02:54,850 --> 01:02:58,286
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

528
01:03:04,726 --> 01:03:08,787
Does that mean my brothers are OK?
Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

529
01:03:08,964 --> 01:03:11,933
Are you sure?
We're looking for a different Ryan.

530
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,590
It's just a big foul-up.

531
01:03:14,436 --> 01:03:18,202
How can you be sure? How do
you know that the foul-up isn't -

532
01:03:18,373 --> 01:03:20,398
that his brothers are OK, and...

533
01:03:20,576 --> 01:03:22,669
Lieutenant.
I'm sorry for the trouble.

534
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:28,043
I just wrote them a letter
before I left. I've got to get home.

535
01:03:28,216 --> 01:03:33,051
I've got to get home right now.
I want to go home.

536
01:03:33,689 --> 01:03:35,088
Where is our Ryan?
Don't know.

537
01:03:35,257 --> 01:03:39,318
Are you in touch with your CO?
What unit's Ryan in?

538
01:03:39,494 --> 01:03:43,487
Baker Company, 506th.
The guy with the broken foot's in 506th.

539
01:03:43,665 --> 01:03:46,156
Charlie, I think.
You think?

540
01:03:46,335 --> 01:03:50,135
Ryan? Don't know...
Man!

541
01:03:50,305 --> 01:03:52,796
Where was your dropzone?
Vierville.

542
01:03:52,975 --> 01:03:55,739
Vierville? How did you end up here?

543
01:03:55,911 --> 01:03:59,039
You got me, sir.
The C-47 took heavy fire.

544
01:03:59,214 --> 01:04:01,739
Pilot went crazy
turning every which way.

545
01:04:01,917 --> 01:04:06,081
We took more fire in the drop.
It got messy. I ended up here.

546
01:04:06,254 --> 01:04:09,382
I haven't seen anyone from my stick.
God knows where they are.

547
01:04:09,558 --> 01:04:13,221
Did anybody from Baker Company
talk about where the dropzone was?

548
01:04:13,395 --> 01:04:16,728
No, but they had the same
rallying point as us.

549
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,832
Show me.

550
01:04:19,668 --> 01:04:25,197
My men are beat. We'll hold up here
for three hours and pull out after dark.

551
01:04:25,374 --> 01:04:28,104
Got anything left in this town,
like a three-star hotel?

552
01:04:28,276 --> 01:04:31,404
Something with clean sheets,
soft pillows and room service?

553
01:04:31,580 --> 01:04:35,038
How about a nice, comfy church?
We'll take that.

554
01:04:35,217 --> 01:04:38,050
What have you heard?
How is it all falling together?

555
01:04:38,220 --> 01:04:42,418
We got the beachhead secured, but
Monty's taking his time moving on Caen.

556
01:04:42,591 --> 01:04:46,652
We can't pull out 'til he's ready, so...
That guy's overrated.

557
01:04:46,828 --> 01:04:50,355
No argument here.
You take Caen to take Saint-L8.

558
01:04:50,532 --> 01:04:54,161
You gotta take St-L8 to take Valognes.
Valognes, you've got Cherbourg.

559
01:04:54,336 --> 01:04:57,828
Cherbourg, you've got Paris.
Paris, you've got Berlin.

560
01:04:58,006 --> 01:05:00,474
And then that big boat home.

561
01:05:03,712 --> 01:05:07,443
I could really use you around here,
but I understand what you're doing.

562
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:11,780
You do?
I've got a couple of brothers myself.

563
01:05:11,953 --> 01:05:14,114
Oh.
Good luck.

564
01:05:14,289 --> 01:05:16,814
Thank you.
No, I mean it.

565
01:05:16,992 --> 01:05:20,086
Find him. Get him home.

566
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:30,030
What's with your hand?

567
01:05:31,273 --> 01:05:33,605
I don't know.

568
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:37,779
It started in Portsmouth
when we went down for embarkation.

569
01:05:37,946 --> 01:05:42,610
It comes and goes.
You have to find yourself a new job.

570
01:05:42,784 --> 01:05:45,446
This one doesn't seem to
agree with you any more.

571
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,054
What?

572
01:05:57,332 --> 01:05:59,300
What?
Nothing.

573
01:05:59,468 --> 01:06:02,232
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

574
01:06:02,404 --> 01:06:05,430
The one who walked on his hands -

575
01:06:05,607 --> 01:06:08,405
and was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze?

576
01:06:08,577 --> 01:06:11,410
Vecchio.
Vecchio!

577
01:06:17,052 --> 01:06:20,783
Yeah, Vecchio.
He was a goofy kid.

578
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:27,259
I remember he used to pee a "v"
on everybody's jackets. For "vecchio".

579
01:06:27,429 --> 01:06:30,421
For victory.
Vecchio.

580
01:06:33,101 --> 01:06:36,798
He was so short.
He was a midget, wasn't he?

581
01:06:36,972 --> 01:06:40,806
Yeah, how did he get to be a Ranger?

582
01:06:40,976 --> 01:06:43,604
He got shot in the foot once,
walking on his hands.

583
01:06:43,779 --> 01:06:47,613
He could walk faster on his hands.

584
01:06:47,783 --> 01:06:50,684
He could run faster on his hands.

585
01:06:53,421 --> 01:06:57,118
Vecchio. Yeah.

586
01:06:58,794 --> 01:07:01,092
Caparzo.

587
01:07:06,635 --> 01:07:12,540
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men, -

588
01:07:12,707 --> 01:07:17,440
you tell yourself it happened
so you could save the lives of -

589
01:07:17,612 --> 01:07:21,878
two, three, or ten others.

590
01:07:23,084 --> 01:07:25,575
Maybe 100 others.

591
01:07:29,224 --> 01:07:32,159
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

592
01:07:32,327 --> 01:07:34,625
How many?
94.

593
01:07:35,764 --> 01:07:41,703
But that means I've saved the lives
of ten times that many, doesn't it?

594
01:07:42,737 --> 01:07:46,764
Maybe even 20, right?
20 times as many?

595
01:07:52,147 --> 01:07:55,378
And that's how simple it is.

596
01:07:55,550 --> 01:08:00,749
That's how you rationalise
making the choice -

597
01:08:00,922 --> 01:08:04,016
between the mission and the men.

598
01:08:04,192 --> 01:08:07,093
Except that this time
the mission is a man.

599
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,393
This Ryan had better be worth it.

600
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:18,834
He'd better go home
and cure some disease -

601
01:08:19,007 --> 01:08:23,205
or invent a longer-lasting light-bulb
or something.

602
01:08:23,378 --> 01:08:27,838
For the truth is that I wouldn't trade
ten Ryans for one Vecchio or Caparzo.

603
01:08:28,016 --> 01:08:29,847
Amen.

604
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:35,448
Look, there it goes again.
Sir.

605
01:08:36,892 --> 01:08:38,519
Are you alright?

606
01:08:42,998 --> 01:08:47,765
We'll move out in two hours.
Why don't you get some sleep?

607
01:08:48,737 --> 01:08:51,763
I don't know how he does it.
What's that?

608
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,500
Falls asleep like that. Look at him.

609
01:08:54,676 --> 01:08:57,668
The guy's lights-out
the minute his head hits the pack.

610
01:08:57,846 --> 01:09:01,213
Clear conscience.
What's that saying?

611
01:09:01,383 --> 01:09:03,715
God's on our side,
who could be on theirs?

612
01:09:03,885 --> 01:09:06,877
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

613
01:09:07,055 --> 01:09:09,182
Yeah, what did I say?

614
01:09:09,357 --> 01:09:13,555
The trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

615
01:09:13,728 --> 01:09:15,423
How is that, Wade?

616
01:09:15,597 --> 01:09:20,557
When my mother was an intern
she used to work through the night -

617
01:09:20,735 --> 01:09:22,168
and sleep through the day.

618
01:09:23,138 --> 01:09:26,505
The only time we talked
was when she'd get home.

619
01:09:26,675 --> 01:09:33,638
I used to lie in bed and stay awake
as long as I could, but it never worked -

620
01:09:33,815 --> 01:09:38,149
because the harder I tried
the faster I'd fall asleep.

621
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:41,585
That wouldn't have mattered in
my house. Ma would've come home, -

622
01:09:41,756 --> 01:09:46,921
shook me awake, chatted me up 'til
dawn. She was never too tired to talk.

623
01:09:47,095 --> 01:09:50,394
That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

624
01:09:55,136 --> 01:09:58,765
Funny thing is, sometimes
she would come home early -

625
01:09:58,940 --> 01:10:01,340
and I'd pretend to be asleep.

626
01:10:01,509 --> 01:10:05,377
Who, your mum?
Yeah.

627
01:10:07,882 --> 01:10:11,318
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me, -

628
01:10:11,486 --> 01:10:14,387
and I would just keep my eyes shut.

629
01:10:16,491 --> 01:10:20,450
And I knew that she just wanted to
find out about my day, -

630
01:10:20,628 --> 01:10:27,124
that she came home early
just to talk to me.

631
01:10:29,938 --> 01:10:34,034
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to be asleep.

632
01:10:41,116 --> 01:10:43,482
I don't know why I did that.

633
01:10:56,998 --> 01:11:00,456
We've only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

634
01:11:09,377 --> 01:11:12,676
Captain? Sir?

635
01:11:14,249 --> 01:11:15,910
Corporal.

636
01:11:20,488 --> 01:11:23,855
How are you doing? Are you alright?

637
01:11:24,025 --> 01:11:27,188
Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir.

638
01:11:28,663 --> 01:11:32,224
Really? How is that?

639
01:11:36,271 --> 01:11:40,674
'War educates the senses,
calls into action the will," -

640
01:11:40,842 --> 01:11:44,039
"perfects the physical constitution," -

641
01:11:44,212 --> 01:11:47,978
"brings men in such swift and
close collision in critical moments," -

642
01:11:48,149 --> 01:11:50,515
'that man measures man."

643
01:11:50,685 --> 01:11:55,486
I guess that's Emerson's way
of finding the bright side.

644
01:11:55,657 --> 01:11:59,991
You know Emerson, sir?
I know some.

645
01:12:03,765 --> 01:12:08,134
So, where are you from, Captain?
What did you do before the war?

646
01:12:09,871 --> 01:12:11,930
What's the pool up to?

647
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:19,113
I think it's around 300, sir.

648
01:12:19,280 --> 01:12:23,944
When it gets up to 500, I'll give you
the answer and we'll split the money.

649
01:12:24,119 --> 01:12:26,144
How about that?

650
01:12:26,321 --> 01:12:29,757
If that's the way you feel, I feel
it's my duty under your command -

651
01:12:29,924 --> 01:12:34,884
to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1,000. I think it's...

652
01:12:36,030 --> 01:12:38,624
What if we don't live that long?

653
01:12:41,536 --> 01:12:44,630
500?
500 would be good, yes.

654
01:12:44,806 --> 01:12:46,774
Yes, sir.

655
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:52,538
Get some sleep, Corporal.
Yes, sir.

656
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,810
Who's got sulfa powder?

657
01:14:03,384 --> 01:14:07,650
Medic, my buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet.

658
01:14:07,822 --> 01:14:08,880
Wade.
Yes, sir?

659
01:14:09,057 --> 01:14:11,321
See what you can do.
Yes, sir.

660
01:14:11,492 --> 01:14:14,620
Hold on, fellas.
It won't be much longer.

661
01:14:14,796 --> 01:14:17,196
How are we doing here?

662
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:23,235
Alright. You're doing alright,
don't worry about it. The Doc's in town.

663
01:14:24,806 --> 01:14:28,640
Don't worry. The 29th Infantry's
breaking through. They'll be here soon.

664
01:14:28,810 --> 01:14:31,142
Has anybody got plasma?

665
01:14:31,312 --> 01:14:33,280
Hey, Captain!

666
01:14:33,448 --> 01:14:36,975
Soldier, you want to fill me in?
Yeah. Lieutenant DeWindt.

667
01:14:37,151 --> 01:14:40,951
99th Troop Carrier Squadron carrying
in 300th and 307th Glider Infantry.

668
01:14:41,122 --> 01:14:43,886
This one was mine. I was the pilot.
Private!

669
01:14:44,058 --> 01:14:45,355
22 men dead.
Take care of this one.

670
01:14:45,526 --> 01:14:48,324
I landed there without a scratch,
took my co-pilot's head right off.

671
01:14:48,496 --> 01:14:50,259
Who are these people?

672
01:14:50,431 --> 01:14:54,663
The guys we came in with headed off
the first night. Haven't seen them since.

673
01:14:54,836 --> 01:14:58,772
In the meantime other guys keep
showing up. One, two, six at a time.

674
01:14:58,940 --> 01:15:01,773
Then some officer will come along,
patch together a mixed unit, -

675
01:15:01,943 --> 01:15:04,309
and head off to make trouble.

676
01:15:04,479 --> 01:15:08,711
We're looking for a Private Ryan,
Baker Company, 506th of the 101st.

677
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:11,078
You got me.
A lot of guys come in and out.

678
01:15:11,252 --> 01:15:14,517
Upham! Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

679
01:15:14,689 --> 01:15:16,452
Yes, sir.

680
01:15:17,825 --> 01:15:22,990
Reiben! Smell that leg, right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

681
01:15:29,470 --> 01:15:31,529
What?

682
01:15:31,706 --> 01:15:34,140
Hands over your head.

683
01:15:35,977 --> 01:15:37,877
Keep moving!

684
01:15:40,682 --> 01:15:42,479
I'm Jude, you know.

685
01:15:45,119 --> 01:15:48,919
I couldn't pry him out of there.
I need a winch.

686
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:50,717
Yeah.

687
01:15:53,928 --> 01:15:56,192
Stars.
Yeah.

688
01:15:56,364 --> 01:16:00,824
Brigadier General Amend.
Deputy Commander, 101st.

689
01:16:01,002 --> 01:16:05,769
Some genius had the great idea
of welding steel plates onto our deck -

690
01:16:05,940 --> 01:16:08,340
to keep the General safe
from ground fire, -

691
01:16:08,509 --> 01:16:12,673
but they forgot to tell me until
just before we were getting airborne.

692
01:16:12,847 --> 01:16:16,408
That's like trying to
fly a freight train. OK?

693
01:16:16,584 --> 01:16:20,247
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

694
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:23,322
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

695
01:16:23,491 --> 01:16:27,825
When we released
I cut as hard as I could, -

696
01:16:27,995 --> 01:16:31,328
trying to gain some altitude
and keep her from stalling.

697
01:16:31,499 --> 01:16:36,402
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

698
01:16:37,939 --> 01:16:41,238
The others stopped
easy enough, though.

699
01:16:41,409 --> 01:16:45,004
We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

700
01:16:45,179 --> 01:16:50,446
The grass was wet.
Downward slope and all.

701
01:16:50,618 --> 01:16:52,950
22 guys dead.

702
01:16:55,256 --> 01:16:59,215
All that for a general?
One man.

703
01:17:01,028 --> 01:17:04,191
There's a lot of that going around.
"FUBAR."

704
01:17:05,032 --> 01:17:07,057
"FUBAR."
"FUBAR."

705
01:17:07,735 --> 01:17:11,796
"FUBAR."
You all got that right.

706
01:17:11,973 --> 01:17:14,703
I looked it up in a German dictionary.
"FUBAR"'s not there.

707
01:17:14,876 --> 01:17:17,436
Upham! There are
more paratroopers out there.

708
01:17:17,612 --> 01:17:19,978
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

709
01:17:20,148 --> 01:17:23,117
You might want to check this out, sir.

710
01:17:23,284 --> 01:17:26,811
Dog tags. More than
I really want to count, sir.

711
01:17:28,756 --> 01:17:31,748
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

712
01:17:31,926 --> 01:17:36,659
Jackson. Start going through those.
Yes, sir.

713
01:17:37,698 --> 01:17:38,926
I'll help.

714
01:17:41,869 --> 01:17:46,397
Do you think that little prick's in there?
If he is, I'm going to find him.

715
01:17:46,574 --> 01:17:49,338
I bet that son of a bitch...
I've got money saying he's still alive.

716
01:17:49,510 --> 01:17:53,344
10 bucks says I nail him first.
Let's see what we've got in here.

717
01:17:53,514 --> 01:17:56,415
You mugs don't stand a chance.
Do you think he's in here?

718
01:17:56,584 --> 01:17:59,246
Just keep looking.
Alright.

719
01:17:59,420 --> 01:18:04,653
"Gary lanico", "Ben Rubino", "Mike
Cesario"...All the Guineas are buying it.

720
01:18:04,826 --> 01:18:09,263
Come on, it's not the right name!
'Wee Willie Winkie". A buddy of yours.

721
01:18:10,031 --> 01:18:12,022
We've got to find this prick.

722
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:18,268
Where's this son of a bitch?

723
01:18:18,439 --> 01:18:20,771
Don't mix them up.
Keep them in your pile.

724
01:18:20,942 --> 01:18:23,274
How am I supposed to know
who we've got?

725
01:18:23,444 --> 01:18:26,106
Why don't you just shut up, Reiben?

726
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:30,546
Everybody be friends.
Cranky there, huh?

727
01:18:30,718 --> 01:18:33,619
I think I've got a winner.
What are you talking about?

728
01:18:33,788 --> 01:18:36,052
"Ryan."
Ryan?

729
01:18:36,224 --> 01:18:39,785
Take a look at that, Mellis.
You're really a genius.

730
01:18:39,961 --> 01:18:44,523
"R-l-E-N-N-E." That's "Rienne" and it's
French. Do you know what that means?

731
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:47,327
It means "nothing".
What beats three of a kind?

732
01:18:47,502 --> 01:18:51,905
I got shit here, all guys from New York.
You're always bitching.

733
01:18:52,073 --> 01:18:54,041
Do you need a hand?
I've got a full house.

734
01:18:54,208 --> 01:18:57,234
I've got you beat. Straight flush.

735
01:18:57,411 --> 01:19:00,710
You're looking at my cards.
You're cheating.

736
01:19:00,882 --> 01:19:04,875
Fucking unreal, this guy.
Can you read that shit?

737
01:19:05,052 --> 01:19:09,648
Jesus, look at this poor bastard!
I guess they're not bulletproof.

738
01:19:09,824 --> 01:19:11,086
I guess not.

739
01:19:11,259 --> 01:19:15,821
I don't like what's between his ears.
It's like what's between your legs.

740
01:19:15,997 --> 01:19:19,455
We've got to give him that.
That's not bad for you, Jackson.

741
01:19:19,634 --> 01:19:22,501
I've got three of a kind.
What the hell are you doing?

742
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:26,470
The whole goddam Airborne's
watching. These aren't poker chips.

743
01:19:26,641 --> 01:19:29,166
Alright.
Put them back in there.

744
01:19:53,868 --> 01:19:55,529
He's not here.

745
01:20:00,041 --> 01:20:02,532
Maybe we should split into groups?

746
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,940
Just wander the woods
calling his name.

747
01:20:05,112 --> 01:20:07,876
He's bound to hear us
sooner or later. Ryan!

748
01:20:08,049 --> 01:20:11,644
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

749
01:20:11,819 --> 01:20:18,622
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Ryan, James Ryan?

750
01:20:18,793 --> 01:20:22,490
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne? You know Ryan?

751
01:20:22,663 --> 01:20:27,600
Private James Ryan from lowa?
Anybody know a Ryan?

752
01:20:27,768 --> 01:20:31,260
James Ryan!
Hey, Joe!

753
01:20:31,439 --> 01:20:35,705
Doesn't Michaelson pal around with
a Ryan from C Company?

754
01:20:35,876 --> 01:20:39,175
I think so.
Bring him up.

755
01:20:48,522 --> 01:20:50,786
You know Private Ryan?
You have to speak up...

756
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:54,189
You have to speak up, sir!
My hearing is not so good!

757
01:20:54,362 --> 01:20:57,229
It comes and goes.
A grenade went off right by my head.

758
01:20:57,398 --> 01:21:01,926
Got it. Do you know Private Ryan?
Who?

759
01:21:02,103 --> 01:21:05,630
Private Ryan? James Ryan?
Jimmy Ryan?

760
01:21:05,806 --> 01:21:08,673
James. James Francis Ryan.

761
01:21:08,843 --> 01:21:11,869
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

762
01:21:12,046 --> 01:21:15,140
Give me a pencil.
Something to write on.

763
01:21:15,316 --> 01:21:16,874
Quick, a pencil!

764
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,985
Here you are, a small one.

765
01:21:21,989 --> 01:21:26,858
Write this down:
"James Francis Ryan? lowa?"

766
01:21:27,028 --> 01:21:30,862
"Do you know him?"
Read the message! Look!

767
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:37,301
Yeah, of course I know him.
Does he know where he is?

768
01:21:41,342 --> 01:21:44,641
Yeah, we missed our dropzone
by about 20 miles -

769
01:21:44,812 --> 01:21:48,043
and ended up way over by
"Bumville" or some damn place.

770
01:21:48,215 --> 01:21:51,309
Him, me and a couple of others
were coming here to the rally point.

771
01:21:51,485 --> 01:21:57,151
We ran into a colonel who was
gathering up men to go to Ramelle.

772
01:21:57,324 --> 01:21:59,417
Ramelle?
To babysit a bridge.

773
01:21:59,593 --> 01:22:02,585
That's the last I've seen of him.
Great! Thank you!

774
01:22:02,763 --> 01:22:05,857
Write "Thank you". Read. Thank you.
You're welcome!

775
01:22:06,033 --> 01:22:07,796
Assemble on me.

776
01:22:09,770 --> 01:22:11,738
Thank you, Lieutenant.

777
01:22:14,375 --> 01:22:16,400
Ramelle.

778
01:22:17,344 --> 01:22:22,839
We're here. There. Ramelle is
on the Merderet River, right here.

779
01:22:23,017 --> 01:22:25,110
Just to the southwest of us.

780
01:22:25,286 --> 01:22:27,618
You know anything about that bridge?

781
01:22:27,788 --> 01:22:32,225
Yeah. The target
has always been Cherbourg.

782
01:22:32,393 --> 01:22:37,558
We can't push on Paris until we take a
deep water port and Rommel knows that.

783
01:22:37,732 --> 01:22:42,260
He's going to try to get his armour across
the Merderet River anyway he can.

784
01:22:42,436 --> 01:22:47,305
That way he can hit us in the flank
when we make the turn for Cherbourg.

785
01:22:47,475 --> 01:22:53,243
That makes any village on the river
with a bridge solid gold real estate.

786
01:23:13,534 --> 01:23:14,899
Let's go.

787
01:23:24,445 --> 01:23:26,037
Captain.

788
01:24:04,218 --> 01:24:07,119
What the hell is that?

789
01:24:07,288 --> 01:24:10,314
A radar site. It's got to be out of action.

790
01:24:10,491 --> 01:24:16,452
Looks like we've got something in
that sandbag bunker under the station.

791
01:24:16,630 --> 01:24:20,657
See it?
Yeah, that's my guess, too.

792
01:24:20,835 --> 01:24:25,738
What is it?
Machine gun, probably MG-42.

793
01:24:25,906 --> 01:24:29,808
Is that what got those guys?
Maybe one of them is Ryan.

794
01:24:29,977 --> 01:24:32,969
No, their patches are 82nd,
so your luck's not that good.

795
01:24:33,147 --> 01:24:37,914
I don't know how fast you are, but if
we detour this way quick and quiet, -

796
01:24:38,085 --> 01:24:39,814
the Krauts will never even know
we were here.

797
01:24:41,422 --> 01:24:44,823
What I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

798
01:24:44,992 --> 01:24:48,758
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

799
01:24:50,197 --> 01:24:53,860
I'm with Reiben.
I mean, we left those 88s.

800
01:24:54,735 --> 01:25:00,571
For the Air Force. They're not going to
spend ordnance on one machine gun.

801
01:25:00,741 --> 01:25:02,038
Captain.

802
01:25:03,277 --> 01:25:08,180
We can skip it and still accomplish our
mission. This isn't our mission, right?

803
01:25:08,349 --> 01:25:10,579
Is that what you want to do, Mellish?

804
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:13,276
Leave it here
so they can ambush another company?

805
01:25:13,454 --> 01:25:19,188
No, I'm simply saying it's seems
an unnecessary risk given our objective.

806
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,828
Our objective is to win the war.

807
01:25:25,332 --> 01:25:29,291
It's just that I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

808
01:25:31,839 --> 01:25:35,798
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

809
01:25:56,497 --> 01:25:59,557
Alright. Three runners
with suppressing fire.

810
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:02,930
Mellish. You hook to the right,
I'll go up the middle.

811
01:26:03,103 --> 01:26:05,071
Who's going left?

812
01:26:11,278 --> 01:26:13,872
Who's going left?

813
01:26:17,351 --> 01:26:19,717
I'll do it.

814
01:26:19,887 --> 01:26:22,287
I go left.
Alright.

815
01:26:22,456 --> 01:26:25,857
Upham, switch off with Jackson
and you linger in the rear.

816
01:26:27,494 --> 01:26:31,362
We advance and keep pressure on him
'til he has to change out his barrels.

817
01:26:33,167 --> 01:26:35,158
We should be able to hit them
from grenade range.

818
01:26:35,336 --> 01:26:39,238
Maybe I should go up the middle?
The way you run? I don't think so.

819
01:26:39,406 --> 01:26:43,706
Maybe I should go left, sir.
Maybe you should shut up!

820
01:26:43,877 --> 01:26:46,778
Reiben, base of fire.

821
01:26:54,989 --> 01:26:57,719
Mags and clips
where you can reach them -

822
01:26:57,891 --> 01:27:00,655
and extra grenades
for the base runners.

823
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:28,580
Hill's clear. Four down and dead!
Upham!

824
01:28:28,749 --> 01:28:32,378
Grab the gear and get up here!
We need water and extra dressing.

825
01:28:32,553 --> 01:28:37,388
Get the morphine
out of the medical kit!

826
01:28:48,936 --> 01:28:51,200
Son of a bitch!
Get some sulfa on there.

827
01:28:51,371 --> 01:28:53,532
Move my legs up.
I got them.

828
01:28:53,707 --> 01:28:55,402
Pour sulfa.
Listen to my voice.

829
01:28:55,576 --> 01:28:57,771
You're going to be alright, Doc.

830
01:28:59,413 --> 01:29:01,540
You're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

831
01:29:01,715 --> 01:29:04,411
More sulfa!
Move my legs up.

832
01:29:04,585 --> 01:29:07,452
Put my legs up.
I've got them.

833
01:29:07,621 --> 01:29:09,589
You're going to be OK.
It's alright, Doc.

834
01:29:09,756 --> 01:29:12,725
Upham, give me your canteen!
Come on.

835
01:29:12,893 --> 01:29:17,159
We're going to get you out of here.
Put some pressure on it.

836
01:29:17,331 --> 01:29:19,526
Am I shot? How does it look?
Give him some morphine.

837
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:23,761
How does it look?
You're going to be OK.

838
01:29:23,937 --> 01:29:25,529
Here comes the morphine.

839
01:29:26,306 --> 01:29:29,241
Am I shot in the spine?

840
01:29:30,010 --> 01:29:32,342
You're OK.
Am I shot in the spine?

841
01:29:32,513 --> 01:29:34,572
Lift him up.
Move him over.

842
01:29:34,748 --> 01:29:37,410
Put some pressure on.
Easy, easy.

843
01:29:41,121 --> 01:29:44,181
It's OK, Doc. It's alright.

844
01:29:44,358 --> 01:29:48,419
Wade, you've got an exit wound.
It's in the small of your back.

845
01:29:48,595 --> 01:29:52,031
How big is the hole?
It's about the size of an acorn.

846
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:54,667
It's fine.
Put him back.

847
01:29:56,870 --> 01:30:01,000
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

848
01:30:01,175 --> 01:30:03,803
Put some pressure on it!

849
01:30:05,179 --> 01:30:06,771
Put some more pressure on it.

850
01:30:08,415 --> 01:30:10,576
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

851
01:30:10,751 --> 01:30:13,948
Yeah, right here.
Do you know what it is? Right here.

852
01:30:14,121 --> 01:30:17,613
I'll put your hand on it.
We got some pressure on there.

853
01:30:17,791 --> 01:30:19,656
That's the one.

854
01:30:19,826 --> 01:30:23,922
Oh, my God! My liver!
It's my liver!

855
01:30:25,032 --> 01:30:27,364
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

856
01:30:27,534 --> 01:30:30,196
What can we do?
Tell us what to do.

857
01:30:32,206 --> 01:30:36,540
I could use a little morphine.

858
01:30:37,311 --> 01:30:39,871
More morphine, sir.

859
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:43,039
OK. OK.

860
01:30:45,118 --> 01:30:48,519
Sir? What?
Give it to him.

861
01:30:50,157 --> 01:30:52,284
Give it to him.

862
01:30:55,963 --> 01:31:00,866
I don't want to die!
Here you go, Wade. Here it comes.

863
01:31:05,639 --> 01:31:07,470
Give him another one.

864
01:31:14,648 --> 01:31:16,775
Mama...

865
01:31:18,485 --> 01:31:20,544
Mama.

866
01:31:20,721 --> 01:31:24,384
I want to go home,
I want go home.

867
01:31:25,292 --> 01:31:28,125
Mama, Mama, Mama...

868
01:31:28,295 --> 01:31:33,858
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama...

869
01:32:14,107 --> 01:32:16,268
Reiben, hold him!

870
01:32:36,496 --> 01:32:38,225
Not yet!

871
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:43,426
First make him mark and cover
Wade's body for Grave Detail.

872
01:32:45,005 --> 01:32:48,168
Same thing for the paratroopers
down there.

873
01:32:48,342 --> 01:32:50,902
Strip that stuff off him.
Check him for intelligence.

874
01:32:51,078 --> 01:32:55,105
Ask this piece of shit if he shot Wade!
Ask him!

875
01:32:55,282 --> 01:32:56,772
Does it matter?
It does!

876
01:33:00,387 --> 01:33:03,220
Shut up with that filthy pig Latin.

877
01:33:05,058 --> 01:33:08,084
Jackson, are you hit?

878
01:33:11,031 --> 01:33:12,328
It just skinned the arm.

879
01:33:12,499 --> 01:33:17,937
Get it cleaned and dressed.
You and Sarge watch the perimeter.

880
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,170
He says, "Please don't shoot."
I don't care what he says, Upham.

881
01:33:25,445 --> 01:33:28,380
Sir? Sir, are you going to
let them kill him?

882
01:33:29,416 --> 01:33:33,716
This is not right, sir.
You can help him with the bodies.

883
01:33:36,056 --> 01:33:38,183
What is happening?

884
01:35:28,301 --> 01:35:31,395
American.

885
01:35:31,571 --> 01:35:33,505
I like American.

886
01:35:40,847 --> 01:35:43,407
Steamboat Willie.

887
01:35:43,583 --> 01:35:47,986
Steamboat Willie.
Steamboat Willie. American.

888
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:05,137
He says he's not finished.
That's what you think. Come on.

889
01:36:13,146 --> 01:36:16,980
Please! I like America!

890
01:36:18,184 --> 01:36:20,209
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

891
01:36:20,387 --> 01:36:23,879
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue! Cool beans!

892
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:30,553
Betty Boop! What a dish.

893
01:36:30,730 --> 01:36:32,823
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

894
01:36:39,906 --> 01:36:42,704
I say can you see

895
01:36:42,876 --> 01:36:45,845
I say can you see

896
01:36:46,012 --> 01:36:48,139
I say...

897
01:36:55,021 --> 01:36:56,716
Fuck Hitler.

898
01:36:58,692 --> 01:37:00,751
Fuck Hitler!

899
01:37:09,469 --> 01:37:13,667
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.
He says he's sorry about Wade.

900
01:37:13,840 --> 01:37:15,501
Captain!

901
01:37:15,675 --> 01:37:19,236
Captain, this isn't right.
You know this.

902
01:37:19,412 --> 01:37:24,247
He's a prisoner. He surrendered.
He surrendered, sir!

903
01:37:34,628 --> 01:37:36,289
Tell him...

904
01:37:38,565 --> 01:37:43,468
...to march 1,000 paces in that direction.
Then he can take off the blindfold.

905
01:37:43,637 --> 01:37:46,333
He turns himself in
to the first Allied patrol.

906
01:37:46,506 --> 01:37:48,133
Are you kidding? We're letting him go?

907
01:37:48,308 --> 01:37:52,039
He's a POW, Reiben.
We can't take him with us.

908
01:37:52,212 --> 01:37:56,842
Our guys will pick him up.
That was a close shave.

909
01:37:57,017 --> 01:37:59,042
Lucky Strikes.

910
01:38:02,856 --> 01:38:05,051
Take me out to the ball game...

911
01:38:05,225 --> 01:38:10,959
Only if he doesn't get picked up by his
own and get thrown back into circulation.

912
01:38:12,465 --> 01:38:16,424
Captain, you just let the enemy go.
This is such bullshit.

913
01:38:16,603 --> 01:38:20,437
You all got that right.
Bullshit? This is bullshit?

914
01:38:20,607 --> 01:38:23,201
Shooting a prisoner is OK?
It's against the rules!

915
01:38:23,376 --> 01:38:27,836
The goddam rules just walked off
with your new friend.

916
01:38:29,282 --> 01:38:32,683
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, Captain?

917
01:38:40,293 --> 01:38:42,818
Get your gear. Let's go.

918
01:38:45,165 --> 01:38:47,463
You heard him. Gear up.

919
01:38:48,501 --> 01:38:51,800
The Captain just gave you an order.
Yeah.

920
01:38:51,971 --> 01:38:55,737
Like the one he gave to take this
machine gun. That was a real doozy.

921
01:38:55,909 --> 01:38:57,399
You're out of line!

922
01:38:57,577 --> 01:39:00,546
That was one hell of a call
coming to take this nest, -

923
01:39:00,714 --> 01:39:03,683
but what the hell, we only lost
one of our guys going for it.

924
01:39:03,850 --> 01:39:07,149
I hope Mama Ryan's really happy
knowing that little Jimmy's life -

925
01:39:07,320 --> 01:39:09,720
was more important
than two of our guys!

926
01:39:09,889 --> 01:39:12,949
But then, we haven't found them,
have we?

927
01:39:14,661 --> 01:39:16,128
Hey...
Get off me!

928
01:39:16,296 --> 01:39:18,696
Reiben, get up.

929
01:39:19,933 --> 01:39:23,334
Gear up. Fall in.

930
01:39:28,007 --> 01:39:30,475
I'm done with this mission.

931
01:39:35,315 --> 01:39:37,875
Hey! Hey!

932
01:39:38,685 --> 01:39:40,744
Sir...
Don't you walk away from your captain!

933
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,150
Reiben, get back in line!
No, sir.

934
01:39:43,323 --> 01:39:46,053
I'll spend the rest of my life
in the stockade rather than go on.

935
01:39:46,226 --> 01:39:48,660
I'm not going to ask you again.
Captain!

936
01:39:48,828 --> 01:39:51,262
This is bullshit!
Fall in!

937
01:39:51,431 --> 01:39:54,696
Are you going to shoot me over Ryan?
No, because I don't like you.

938
01:39:54,868 --> 01:39:57,098
If he wants to go, just let him go!

939
01:39:57,270 --> 01:40:00,535
Are you letting this happen? Captain!
You see this?

940
01:40:00,707 --> 01:40:03,699
Captain. Sir, Ryan's dead.

941
01:40:03,877 --> 01:40:06,277
Bullshit!
We have a situation here.

942
01:40:06,446 --> 01:40:08,880
I have a sixth sense.
I know it in my bones.

943
01:40:09,048 --> 01:40:11,744
We didn't kill the Kraut.
Now you're going to shoot me.

944
01:40:11,918 --> 01:40:14,250
He's better than you.
Just do it!

945
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:18,857
Put one in my leg...
I'll shoot you in your big mouth!

946
01:40:19,025 --> 01:40:20,720
Put your money
where your mouth is and do it!

947
01:40:20,894 --> 01:40:23,556
You don't know how to shut up.

948
01:40:23,730 --> 01:40:28,360
Captain, please!
What's the pool on me up to?

949
01:40:28,535 --> 01:40:31,868
You are a coward son of a bitch!
I'm waiting, Sarge.

950
01:40:32,038 --> 01:40:35,132
What's the pool on me up to right now?

951
01:40:35,308 --> 01:40:37,640
What's it up to?

952
01:40:37,811 --> 01:40:40,678
What is it? 300 dollars, is that it?

953
01:40:40,847 --> 01:40:43,111
I'm a schoolteacher.

954
01:40:46,653 --> 01:40:49,952
I teach English Composition...

955
01:40:50,123 --> 01:40:52,523
...in this little town
called Addley, Pennsylvania.

956
01:40:52,692 --> 01:40:57,857
In the last 11 years, I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

957
01:40:59,966 --> 01:41:04,335
I was the coach of
the baseball team in the springtime.

958
01:41:06,339 --> 01:41:08,102
I'll be doggone.

959
01:41:08,274 --> 01:41:11,766
Back home, when I tell people
what I do for a living -

960
01:41:11,945 --> 01:41:15,642
they think, 'Well, that figures."

961
01:41:16,683 --> 01:41:20,449
But over here, it's...

962
01:41:20,620 --> 01:41:24,954
...a big, big mystery.

963
01:41:26,192 --> 01:41:30,151
So, I guess I've changed some.

964
01:41:31,464 --> 01:41:34,661
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much -

965
01:41:34,834 --> 01:41:38,930
my wife is even going to recognise me
whenever I get back to her...

966
01:41:40,807 --> 01:41:43,708
...and how I'll ever be able to...

967
01:41:45,912 --> 01:41:48,847
...tell her about days like today.

968
01:41:51,117 --> 01:41:54,245
Ryan...

969
01:41:54,420 --> 01:41:57,981
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

970
01:41:58,157 --> 01:42:00,182
He means nothing to me,
it's just a name, -

971
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:07,596
but if going to Ramelle
and finding him so he can go home, -

972
01:42:07,767 --> 01:42:11,601
if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife, then...

973
01:42:11,771 --> 01:42:14,831
...then that's my mission.

974
01:42:15,909 --> 01:42:21,370
You want to leave?
You want to go off and fight the war?

975
01:42:23,549 --> 01:42:26,211
Alright.

976
01:42:26,386 --> 01:42:33,383
Alright, I won't stop you.
I'll even put in the paperwork.

977
01:42:33,559 --> 01:42:38,360
I just know that with every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

978
01:44:03,116 --> 01:44:08,110
...by memories of days gone by

979
01:44:09,956 --> 01:44:14,859
In my solitude you taunt me

980
01:44:15,028 --> 01:44:19,829
with memories that never die

981
01:44:19,999 --> 01:44:24,868
I sit in my chair
filled with despair

982
01:44:25,038 --> 01:44:30,066
There's no one could be so sad

983
01:44:30,243 --> 01:44:34,680
With gloom everywhere
I sit and I stare

984
01:44:34,847 --> 01:44:39,409
I know that I'll soon go mad

985
01:44:48,561 --> 01:44:50,688
Half-track! Cover!

986
01:45:06,412 --> 01:45:10,348
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

987
01:45:30,803 --> 01:45:33,294
Get ready to move. Take their left flank!

988
01:45:33,473 --> 01:45:35,703
Hold on and make sure they're down.

989
01:45:57,196 --> 01:46:00,359
101st! We're coming out!

990
01:46:07,306 --> 01:46:10,275
That was a recon. element, 2nd SS.

991
01:46:11,644 --> 01:46:15,171
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

992
01:46:17,016 --> 01:46:20,349
Captain Miller, Charlie Company,
2nd Rangers.

993
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:22,647
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501st.

994
01:46:22,822 --> 01:46:26,690
Ryan, First of 506th.
Toynbee, Third of 506th.

995
01:46:26,859 --> 01:46:32,627
James Francis Ryan?
Yes, sir. How did you guess that?

996
01:46:43,376 --> 01:46:49,747
Looks like you got hit pretty hard.
Yes, sir. Small unit action.

997
01:46:52,084 --> 01:46:56,487
They came in
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

998
01:47:01,961 --> 01:47:05,419
Tell you what. If you're our relief,
I'm going to file a complaint.

999
01:47:05,598 --> 01:47:08,089
I wouldn't blame you.

1000
01:47:08,267 --> 01:47:11,498
Who's your CO?

1001
01:47:11,671 --> 01:47:14,333
It would've been Captain Jennings.

1002
01:47:14,507 --> 01:47:17,670
I'm afraid the best
we can muster up now is a corporal.

1003
01:47:19,078 --> 01:47:22,104
So what are you guys all about?

1004
01:47:22,281 --> 01:47:25,842
We're here for him. Ryan.

1005
01:47:26,018 --> 01:47:27,883
Me, sir?

1006
01:47:36,796 --> 01:47:40,061
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

1007
01:47:40,233 --> 01:47:45,398
Yes, sir. Peyton, lowa, that's correct.
What is this about?

1008
01:47:47,406 --> 01:47:50,136
Your brothers were killed in combat.

1009
01:47:57,083 --> 01:47:59,074
Which ones?

1010
01:48:01,587 --> 01:48:03,919
All of them.

1011
01:48:11,897 --> 01:48:14,559
On the level?

1012
01:48:15,868 --> 01:48:19,269
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1013
01:48:20,506 --> 01:48:22,497
You might want to
take some time with this.

1014
01:48:22,675 --> 01:48:25,974
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1015
01:48:34,720 --> 01:48:37,587
What's this all about?
Ryan lost his brothers.

1016
01:48:37,757 --> 01:48:40,851
Which one?
All of them.

1017
01:48:49,101 --> 01:48:51,831
You came all the way out here
to tell me that?

1018
01:48:54,173 --> 01:48:57,438
You're going home.

1019
01:48:57,610 --> 01:49:00,374
Our orders are to bring you back.

1020
01:49:03,849 --> 01:49:06,079
Bring me back?

1021
01:49:07,620 --> 01:49:12,455
Corporal, I don't mean to leave you more
short-handed, but orders are orders.

1022
01:49:12,625 --> 01:49:15,287
Any communications about
when you will be relieved?

1023
01:49:15,461 --> 01:49:18,453
We can't tell. We don't know
what's happening south of us.

1024
01:49:18,631 --> 01:49:21,998
My orders don't include me
abandoning my post.

1025
01:49:22,168 --> 01:49:24,830
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1026
01:49:25,004 --> 01:49:27,302
I don't see that it does, sir.

1027
01:49:28,908 --> 01:49:32,537
The Chief of Staff for the US Army
says it does.

1028
01:49:32,712 --> 01:49:34,942
Our orders are to
hold this bridge at all costs.

1029
01:49:35,114 --> 01:49:38,242
Our planes in the 82nd have taken out
every bridge across the Merderet, -

1030
01:49:38,417 --> 01:49:41,250
with the exception of two:
one at Valognes and this one.

1031
01:49:41,420 --> 01:49:43,980
If the Germans take it,
we'll have to displace.

1032
01:49:44,156 --> 01:49:49,116
Private. It's one thing that your outfit
wants to stay, but your party's over here.

1033
01:49:49,295 --> 01:49:51,195
I can't leave
before the reinforcements are here.

1034
01:49:51,364 --> 01:49:53,798
You've got three
minutes to get your gear.

1035
01:49:53,966 --> 01:49:57,732
What about them, there's barely...
Hey, asshole!

1036
01:49:57,903 --> 01:50:01,839
Two of our guys
already died trying to find you.

1037
01:50:07,313 --> 01:50:10,282
Sir?
That's right.

1038
01:50:19,825 --> 01:50:24,194
What were their names?
Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1039
01:50:26,332 --> 01:50:27,924
Wade and?

1040
01:50:29,168 --> 01:50:30,931
Caparzo.

1041
01:50:43,215 --> 01:50:45,581
It doesn't make any sense.

1042
01:50:47,686 --> 01:50:51,850
It doesn't make any sense, sir.
Why do I deserve to go?

1043
01:50:52,024 --> 01:50:54,925
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard.

1044
01:50:59,865 --> 01:51:02,993
Is that what
they're supposed to tell your mother -

1045
01:51:03,169 --> 01:51:06,297
when they send her
another folded American flag?

1046
01:51:13,479 --> 01:51:16,778
Tell her that when you found me
I was here, -

1047
01:51:16,949 --> 01:51:19,747
and I was with the only brothers
that I have left, -

1048
01:51:19,919 --> 01:51:24,049
and that there was no way
I was going to desert them.

1049
01:51:24,223 --> 01:51:29,422
I think she'll understand that.
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1050
01:52:12,438 --> 01:52:14,565
What are your orders?

1051
01:52:16,308 --> 01:52:20,369
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1052
01:52:20,546 --> 01:52:23,140
Our world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1053
01:52:23,315 --> 01:52:26,751
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1054
01:52:26,919 --> 01:52:30,821
I don't know. What do you think?

1055
01:52:30,990 --> 01:52:33,550
You don't want to know what I think.

1056
01:52:35,561 --> 01:52:37,756
No, Mike, I do.

1057
01:52:40,900 --> 01:52:44,836
Part of me thinks the kid's right.
What's he done to deserve this?

1058
01:52:45,004 --> 01:52:49,065
If he wants to stay here, fine.
Let's leave him and go home.

1059
01:52:50,009 --> 01:52:51,909
Yeah.

1060
01:52:52,077 --> 01:52:57,242
But another part of me thinks,
'What if by some miracle we stay" -

1061
01:52:57,416 --> 01:53:00,214
"and actually make it out of here?"

1062
01:53:00,386 --> 01:53:04,345
Some day we might look back on this
and decide that -

1063
01:53:04,523 --> 01:53:09,051
saving Private Ryan was
the one decent thing we pulled out of -

1064
01:53:09,228 --> 01:53:14,029
this whole godawful, shitty mess.

1065
01:53:14,199 --> 01:53:21,037
That's what I was thinking, sir.
Like you said, Captain.

1066
01:53:22,508 --> 01:53:27,707
We do that,
we all earn the right to go home.

1067
01:53:30,482 --> 01:53:32,643
Oh, brother...

1068
01:53:35,254 --> 01:53:38,223
This is everything.

1069
01:53:38,390 --> 01:53:44,556
You've got the.230 calibre machine
guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1070
01:53:44,730 --> 01:53:47,961
You've got two bazookas,
but they've only got eight rounds left.

1071
01:53:48,133 --> 01:53:50,294
And assorted small arms.

1072
01:53:50,469 --> 01:53:53,734
We had a.60 mortar,
but an arty round took it out.

1073
01:53:53,906 --> 01:53:56,568
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1074
01:53:56,742 --> 01:54:01,372
Which they're sure to do.
What are you thinking, sir?

1075
01:54:01,547 --> 01:54:05,005
I'm thinking I'm going to
whip around the flanks.

1076
01:54:09,288 --> 01:54:12,587
Unless we can draw them up
the main road between the buildings, -

1077
01:54:12,758 --> 01:54:16,319
where all the rubble
makes a bit of a bottleneck...

1078
01:54:16,495 --> 01:54:18,690
Disable him?
If we can.

1079
01:54:18,864 --> 01:54:22,527
Make a 60-tonne roadblock. Then
we've got a fighting chance at her flanks.

1080
01:54:22,701 --> 01:54:24,862
Good. Split them up,
don't let them mass.

1081
01:54:25,037 --> 01:54:27,938
Hit them hard one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1082
01:54:28,107 --> 01:54:32,476
Machine gun on the move down here,
number two up high to piss on them.

1083
01:54:32,645 --> 01:54:37,173
That would be the idea. Jackson!

1084
01:54:37,349 --> 01:54:39,681
If we can,
I'd like to get you up in that bell tower.

1085
01:54:39,852 --> 01:54:42,946
Yes, sir.
I'll give you some company.

1086
01:54:43,122 --> 01:54:49,083
Some company couldn't hurt. A.30
with about a 1,000 rounds would be OK.

1087
01:54:49,261 --> 01:54:51,252
Parker, job opportunity.

1088
01:54:51,430 --> 01:54:53,227
It's not the worst idea ever, -

1089
01:54:53,399 --> 01:54:57,096
but everything depends on getting the
tank down the road for us to knock out.

1090
01:54:57,269 --> 01:55:00,636
How the hell do you plan on doing that?

1091
01:55:00,806 --> 01:55:03,502
He's right. As our colleague
from Airborne pointed out -

1092
01:55:03,676 --> 01:55:05,974
what we've got is a bunch of spit wads.

1093
01:55:06,145 --> 01:55:10,013
How do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1094
01:55:10,182 --> 01:55:11,706
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1095
01:55:12,685 --> 01:55:15,381
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1096
01:55:16,021 --> 01:55:17,386
Yeah, but with what?

1097
01:55:19,825 --> 01:55:24,660
We could try a sticky bomb.
Sticky bomb, sir?

1098
01:55:24,830 --> 01:55:27,025
Sir, are you making that up?

1099
01:55:27,199 --> 01:55:30,430
No, it's in the field manual.
Check it out, if you want to.

1100
01:55:30,602 --> 01:55:34,766
We seem to be out of field manuals.
Perhaps you could enlighten us.

1101
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:38,205
You have some demolition, don't you?
TNT or Composition B?

1102
01:55:38,377 --> 01:55:42,609
Plenty. I've got that bridge wired with
enough Composition B to blow it twice.

1103
01:55:42,781 --> 01:55:44,339
You can spare some, then.

1104
01:55:45,050 --> 01:55:51,455
You take a standard GI sock,
cram it full with Composition B, -

1105
01:55:51,623 --> 01:55:56,686
and rig up a simple fuse. Then you
coat the whole thing with axle grease.

1106
01:55:56,862 --> 01:56:00,263
That way, when you throw it,
it should stick.

1107
01:56:00,432 --> 01:56:02,957
It's a bomb that sticks.
It's a sticky bomb.

1108
01:56:03,135 --> 01:56:07,094
Come up with a better way to knock
the tracks off a tank, I'm all ears.

1109
01:56:07,272 --> 01:56:10,833
This is good.
Now we have to surrender our socks!

1110
01:56:25,290 --> 01:56:26,917
Haul away.

1111
01:56:40,572 --> 01:56:44,975
Select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1112
01:56:45,144 --> 01:56:47,135
I can cover 12 to 9 from here.

1113
01:56:51,350 --> 01:56:53,910
Easy!
I've got her!

1114
01:57:27,953 --> 01:57:29,921
Here are the mines.

1115
01:57:40,265 --> 01:57:43,063
For being the best we can do, -

1116
01:57:43,235 --> 01:57:48,138
that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1117
01:57:49,775 --> 01:57:52,243
And this position right here...

1118
01:57:54,446 --> 01:57:56,539
This is the Alamo.

1119
01:57:56,715 --> 01:58:00,082
They push us this far,
the last man alive blows the bridge.

1120
01:58:00,252 --> 01:58:03,153
We've only got a 30-second delay
on the fuse, so tell everyone -

1121
01:58:03,322 --> 01:58:07,986
that if you're last you'd better hurry
or you'll not live long.

1122
01:58:08,827 --> 01:58:12,820
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1123
01:58:12,998 --> 01:58:17,367
Never more than two feet away from me.
And that's not negotiable.

1124
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:21,828
I'm going to get some ammo. Come on.

1125
01:58:23,909 --> 01:58:27,174
Hey, Upham, listen to me.
Yes.

1126
01:58:27,346 --> 01:58:29,746
Are you listening?
Yes.

1127
01:58:29,915 --> 01:58:33,578
We're going to be displacing and falling
back like crazy sons of bitches, -

1128
01:58:33,752 --> 01:58:38,348
so you've got to be Johnny-on-the-spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1129
01:58:38,523 --> 01:58:39,956
Do you understand?
Johnny-on-the-spot.

1130
01:58:40,125 --> 01:58:44,027
Yeah. Are you alright?
Yeah.

1131
01:58:45,297 --> 01:58:48,460
When we shipped out of England
we got cigarettes -

1132
01:58:48,634 --> 01:58:51,432
and I said,
"No, thank you. I don't smoke."

1133
01:58:56,008 --> 01:59:00,104
Quite a situation, huh?
Unbelievable.

1134
01:59:00,279 --> 01:59:06,081
Yeah. "Fucked-Up
Beyond All Recognition", right?

1135
01:59:06,251 --> 01:59:08,776
You've got that right.

1136
01:59:10,522 --> 01:59:13,889
"FUBAR"!
Alright!

1137
01:59:14,059 --> 01:59:15,321
Ouch.

1138
01:59:15,494 --> 01:59:19,624
Yeah, well...
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1139
01:59:19,798 --> 01:59:21,766
Yeah, OK.

1140
01:59:27,839 --> 01:59:29,739
Take it easy.

1141
01:59:30,642 --> 01:59:32,371
"FUBAR."

1142
02:00:10,148 --> 02:00:13,276
Who's that singing, sir?

1143
02:00:13,452 --> 02:00:15,420
Edith Piaf.

1144
02:00:16,888 --> 02:00:20,187
What is she so upset about?

1145
02:00:20,359 --> 02:00:25,524
Her lover left her, but she still
sees his face everywhere she goes.

1146
02:00:26,765 --> 02:00:28,596
That would do it.

1147
02:00:57,763 --> 02:01:00,994
"Even life itself only represents you."

1148
02:01:03,869 --> 02:01:06,429
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1149
02:01:06,605 --> 02:01:10,063
What was that? She sang it before.
The chorus.

1150
02:01:10,242 --> 02:01:11,971
The chorus.

1151
02:01:12,144 --> 02:01:15,079
"And you speak softly in my ear."

1152
02:01:16,715 --> 02:01:21,778
"And you say things
that make my eyes close."

1153
02:01:24,056 --> 02:01:25,887
"And I find that marvellous."

1154
02:01:26,058 --> 02:01:29,323
Again, Upham...

1155
02:01:29,494 --> 02:01:34,761
...to be honest,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1156
02:01:34,933 --> 02:01:36,491
Marvellous.

1157
02:01:36,668 --> 02:01:40,434
It's a really melancholy song.
At the beginning of the song she says:

1158
02:01:40,605 --> 02:01:46,441
"And then one day you left me
and I've been desperate ever since."

1159
02:01:46,611 --> 02:01:49,637
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the earth."

1160
02:01:49,815 --> 02:01:53,273
Any more songs like this,
the Krauts won't have to shoot me.

1161
02:01:53,452 --> 02:01:56,114
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1162
02:01:56,288 --> 02:01:58,779
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1163
02:01:58,957 --> 02:02:00,948
I'm sorry. It's Edith, you know.

1164
02:02:01,126 --> 02:02:02,923
You know what that song
reminds me of?

1165
02:02:03,095 --> 02:02:07,293
Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz and
what she said when I left for Basic.

1166
02:02:07,466 --> 02:02:09,957
What? "Don't touch me?"

1167
02:02:10,135 --> 02:02:12,603
No. She's our Super's wife.

1168
02:02:12,771 --> 02:02:19,267
She comes into my mum's shop to try
a few things. She's like a 44 Double E.

1169
02:02:19,444 --> 02:02:21,105
Double E?
They're massive.

1170
02:02:21,279 --> 02:02:22,678
Those are big titties.

1171
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:26,875
I've got her convinced that she's a 42 D.
So we're in the dressing room -

1172
02:02:27,052 --> 02:02:31,079
and she tries to get into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle -

1173
02:02:31,256 --> 02:02:33,622
with the shelf-lift brassiere.

1174
02:02:33,792 --> 02:02:36,158
It's beautiful.
She's pouring out of this thing.

1175
02:02:36,328 --> 02:02:38,091
Is it tight?
No, it's beautiful.

1176
02:02:38,263 --> 02:02:42,427
She sees me and can tell I've got a
hard-on the size of the Statue of Liberty.

1177
02:02:42,601 --> 02:02:46,002
She says, "Richard, calm down",
and she says, -

1178
02:02:46,171 --> 02:02:50,107
"Over there, if you see anything
that upsets you, if you're scared," -

1179
02:02:50,275 --> 02:02:56,737
"I want you to close your eyes
and think of these, you understand?"

1180
02:02:56,915 --> 02:02:59,475
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1181
02:03:12,063 --> 02:03:15,055
Are you alright, sir?

1182
02:03:15,233 --> 02:03:17,667
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1183
02:03:22,908 --> 02:03:26,776
Is it true
you were a teacher back home?

1184
02:03:26,945 --> 02:03:30,711
Yes.
That's something I could never do.

1185
02:03:30,882 --> 02:03:35,046
Not with the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir!

1186
02:03:37,756 --> 02:03:40,850
I had a thousand kids like you.

1187
02:03:46,464 --> 02:03:50,332
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1188
02:03:50,502 --> 02:03:55,371
I've been trying and I can't see their
faces at all. Has that happened to you?

1189
02:03:55,540 --> 02:03:58,031
You've got to think of a context.

1190
02:04:00,078 --> 02:04:02,171
What does that mean?

1191
02:04:02,347 --> 02:04:06,078
You don't just think about their faces,
you think about something specific, -

1192
02:04:06,251 --> 02:04:08,617
something you've done together.

1193
02:04:12,290 --> 02:04:15,123
When I want to think of home,
I think of something specific.

1194
02:04:15,293 --> 02:04:19,127
I think of my hammock in the backyard, -

1195
02:04:19,297 --> 02:04:24,701
or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1196
02:04:27,973 --> 02:04:33,502
This one night, two of my brothers
woke me up in the middle of the night.

1197
02:04:35,180 --> 02:04:38,547
They said they had a surprise for me.

1198
02:04:38,717 --> 02:04:41,914
They took me to the barn
up into the loft -

1199
02:04:42,087 --> 02:04:46,046
and there was my oldest brother Dan -

1200
02:04:46,224 --> 02:04:49,284
with Alice Jardine!

1201
02:04:51,796 --> 02:04:56,324
Picture a girl who just
took a nosedive from the ugly tree -

1202
02:04:56,501 --> 02:04:59,732
and hit every branch coming down!

1203
02:05:01,006 --> 02:05:03,634
And Dan's got her shirt off...

1204
02:05:03,808 --> 02:05:10,543
So he's trying to get her bra off
and all of a sudden Sean screams out:

1205
02:05:10,715 --> 02:05:14,742
"Danny, you're a young man.
Don't do it!"

1206
02:05:16,421 --> 02:05:19,982
Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams and jumps up -

1207
02:05:20,158 --> 02:05:23,594
and tries to run out,
but she's got her shirt over her head.

1208
02:05:23,762 --> 02:05:27,630
She runs into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1209
02:05:27,799 --> 02:05:31,735
Now Dan is so mad at us.
He starts coming after us, -

1210
02:05:31,903 --> 02:05:36,272
but at the same time Alice is
unconscious. He's got to wake her up.

1211
02:05:36,441 --> 02:05:39,171
He grabs her by a leg and drags her -

1212
02:05:39,344 --> 02:05:42,711
and at the same time he picks up
a shovel and goes after Sean!

1213
02:05:42,881 --> 02:05:47,818
And Sean says, 'Why are you
trying to hit me? I just did you a favour!"

1214
02:05:48,720 --> 02:05:52,588
This makes Dan more angry.
He tries to swing this thing.

1215
02:05:52,757 --> 02:05:56,488
He loses his shovel. It goes out
of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.

1216
02:05:56,661 --> 02:06:02,293
The thing explodes. The whole barn
almost goes up because of this thing.

1217
02:06:16,348 --> 02:06:19,715
That was it, that was the last...
Dan went off to Basic the next day.

1218
02:06:19,884 --> 02:06:23,581
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1219
02:06:23,755 --> 02:06:25,848
That was two years ago.

1220
02:06:27,892 --> 02:06:30,019
Oh, my.

1221
02:06:31,062 --> 02:06:35,795
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1222
02:06:35,967 --> 02:06:40,904
No. No, that one I save just for me.

1223
02:07:46,438 --> 02:07:48,133
Enemy from the east.

1224
02:07:49,774 --> 02:07:54,404
He sees two Tiger tanks,
two Panzer tanks.

1225
02:07:54,579 --> 02:07:58,538
Infantry. 50 plus change.

1226
02:08:07,358 --> 02:08:10,418
Disperse! You know what to do.
Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1227
02:08:10,595 --> 02:08:14,861
Upham, get some cover.
Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1228
02:08:15,033 --> 02:08:17,593
Everybody check your ammo!

1229
02:08:17,769 --> 02:08:22,468
Good luck, Reiben!
I don't need any luck, I was born lucky!

1230
02:08:35,487 --> 02:08:38,854
One in five tracer.
Yes, and tracers point both ways.

1231
02:08:39,023 --> 02:08:42,322
Why don't you check the head space
and she should run.

1232
02:08:50,702 --> 02:08:53,603
Upham, hustle up!

1233
02:09:43,321 --> 02:09:47,257
Corporal Upham. We don't have
a.30 calibre machine gun here.

1234
02:09:47,425 --> 02:09:52,954
Either Mister Mellish or Mr Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

1235
02:09:53,131 --> 02:09:56,259
Upham! Jackson's fine,
turn around to Mellish!

1236
02:10:17,722 --> 02:10:21,488
There's a ton of infantry.
I don't know if they took the bait, though.

1237
02:10:45,583 --> 02:10:47,881
Have you got any more of that?

1238
02:11:33,665 --> 02:11:35,929
The Panzers didn't take the bait.

1239
02:11:40,938 --> 02:11:43,702
The infantry's moving to the left.

1240
02:11:43,875 --> 02:11:47,072
A half-track just went by
with about 20 troops.

1241
02:13:26,043 --> 02:13:29,740
Mellish, Henderson! Displace!

1242
02:13:50,835 --> 02:13:54,771
Do it, now! Light it up!
You! Light it!

1243
02:14:06,050 --> 02:14:10,453
30 infantry on the right flank. Get over
there, find a hole and stop them!

1244
02:14:10,621 --> 02:14:13,146
Displace!

1245
02:14:23,935 --> 02:14:25,732
Upham!

1246
02:14:40,484 --> 02:14:43,476
Clear!
OK, go!

1247
02:14:43,654 --> 02:14:45,417
Krauts!

1248
02:14:46,991 --> 02:14:49,255
Right flank!

1249
02:15:24,896 --> 02:15:27,797
Get down, get down!

1250
02:15:34,171 --> 02:15:37,334
Upham! Thirty cal, hurry!

1251
02:15:37,508 --> 02:15:40,773
Find the Captain,
this flank's going to fold!

1252
02:16:35,733 --> 02:16:38,167
Traversing! He's still in this fight!

1253
02:16:39,637 --> 02:16:42,265
No! Ryan, get down, get down!

1254
02:16:55,086 --> 02:16:57,350
Ryan!

1255
02:17:15,573 --> 02:17:17,404
Ryan!

1256
02:17:18,676 --> 02:17:21,008
Keep your mouth shut
Get off me!

1257
02:17:21,178 --> 02:17:22,941
Are you alright?
Get off of me!

1258
02:17:23,114 --> 02:17:25,639
I'm fine too, Captain. Thanks.

1259
02:17:25,816 --> 02:17:30,344
Hit them from both sides.
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1260
02:17:34,325 --> 02:17:35,792
Grenade!

1261
02:17:37,528 --> 02:17:40,497
20 mill! 20 mill!

1262
02:17:40,664 --> 02:17:42,359
Flak gun, 20 mm. Take it out!

1263
02:17:55,780 --> 02:17:59,216
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
I ain't got a shot!

1264
02:18:03,721 --> 02:18:08,090
Pincer move! Parker!
Targets eight o'clock, low!

1265
02:18:08,259 --> 02:18:10,420
God grant me strength.

1266
02:18:23,808 --> 02:18:27,005
Let's go, displace! Come on!

1267
02:18:43,360 --> 02:18:46,591
Cover! Upham, cover!

1268
02:19:02,780 --> 02:19:04,907
I'm out of.30 calibre.

1269
02:19:08,285 --> 02:19:10,879
Blessed be the Lord my strength,
which teaches my hands to war -

1270
02:19:11,055 --> 02:19:13,421
and my fingers to fight.

1271
02:19:21,999 --> 02:19:26,493
My goodness and my fortress.
My high tower and deliverer.

1272
02:19:29,840 --> 02:19:32,604
My shield and He in whom I trust.

1273
02:19:36,147 --> 02:19:38,240
Here you go, baby.

1274
02:20:00,771 --> 02:20:03,035
Parker, get down!

1275
02:20:24,161 --> 02:20:26,493
Captain, that 20 mm is killing us.

1276
02:20:26,664 --> 02:20:31,294
We've got to try to flank it somehow.
Let me get over there for a top shot.

1277
02:20:56,460 --> 02:20:58,428
Upham!

1278
02:21:16,680 --> 02:21:21,583
Upham, Upham!
Upham, ammo, goddammit!

1279
02:22:04,662 --> 02:22:08,530
I'm jammed! Got any.30 calibre?
I'm out.

1280
02:22:20,577 --> 02:22:23,045
Upham. Upham!

1281
02:23:15,699 --> 02:23:17,326
Reiben!

1282
02:23:20,804 --> 02:23:22,032
Reiben!

1283
02:23:49,166 --> 02:23:53,535
I'm out! I need another bandolier.
Anybody got a bandolier?

1284
02:24:24,701 --> 02:24:26,828
You piece of shit!

1285
02:25:11,315 --> 02:25:16,480
Let's stop, let's stop!
Listen to me! Stop! No, no, no...

1286
02:25:43,213 --> 02:25:45,010
Fuck!

1287
02:25:52,823 --> 02:25:57,385
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch!

1288
02:25:57,561 --> 02:25:59,722
Son of a bitch!

1289
02:27:21,044 --> 02:27:25,481
I'm out!
Those.60 rounds...

1290
02:27:25,649 --> 02:27:28,550
We can use them without the tube.
How?

1291
02:27:28,719 --> 02:27:32,018
Fuse-arming wire, set back
and heave it!

1292
02:27:47,304 --> 02:27:49,738
Panzer schreck!

1293
02:28:06,823 --> 02:28:08,882
Go, go!

1294
02:28:23,273 --> 02:28:25,867
We're going to the Alamo.

1295
02:28:35,686 --> 02:28:37,984
Alamo! Alamo!

1296
02:28:57,174 --> 02:29:00,735
We'll take it. You fall back!
You be right behind us!

1297
02:29:00,911 --> 02:29:02,902
As soon as we're in business.

1298
02:29:06,950 --> 02:29:09,418
Displace. Reiben!

1299
02:29:11,655 --> 02:29:13,748
Reload!

1300
02:30:01,872 --> 02:30:03,396
Alright, go!

1301
02:30:04,508 --> 02:30:07,443
We're blowing the bridge! Get off!
Off the bridge!

1302
02:30:31,501 --> 02:30:34,402
Sarge! Mike, are you alright?

1303
02:30:34,571 --> 02:30:37,005
I just got the wind knocked out of me.
Let's go!

1304
02:30:37,174 --> 02:30:40,109
Take cover, we're going to
blow this bridge!

1305
02:30:42,012 --> 02:30:43,775
Come on!

1306
02:30:48,451 --> 02:30:50,817
Tiger company's
coming across the bridge.

1307
02:31:23,520 --> 02:31:26,751
Captain, get behind something!

1308
02:31:52,549 --> 02:31:54,346
Mike!

1309
02:31:59,089 --> 02:32:00,886
Mike!

1310
02:32:43,333 --> 02:32:47,463
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

1311
02:34:40,517 --> 02:34:42,007
Upham!

1312
02:35:11,614 --> 02:35:13,809
Hang in there.

1313
02:35:59,129 --> 02:36:01,154
Medic!

1314
02:36:03,700 --> 02:36:06,430
Medic! We've got a medic?

1315
02:36:13,009 --> 02:36:16,740
They're tankbusters, sir. P-51s.

1316
02:36:16,913 --> 02:36:19,074
Angels on our shoulders.

1317
02:36:25,021 --> 02:36:27,182
What, sir?

1318
02:36:31,161 --> 02:36:33,288
James...

1319
02:36:34,464 --> 02:36:36,659
Earn this.

1320
02:36:40,170 --> 02:36:42,570
Earn it.

1321
02:37:10,867 --> 02:37:14,166
"My dear Mrs Ryan."

1322
02:37:14,337 --> 02:37:18,330
"It's with a profound sense of joy
that I write to inform you"-

1323
02:37:18,508 --> 02:37:22,842
"that your son,
Private James Ryan, is well"-

1324
02:37:23,012 --> 02:37:27,813
"and at this moment on his way
home from European battlefields."

1325
02:37:27,984 --> 02:37:32,182
"Reports indicate that James
did his duty in combat"-

1326
02:37:32,355 --> 02:37:35,449
"with great courage
and steadfast dedication"-

1327
02:37:35,625 --> 02:37:40,187
"even after he was informed of
the loss your family has suffered"-

1328
02:37:40,363 --> 02:37:45,357
"in this great campaign to
rid the world of tyranny and oppression."

1329
02:37:45,535 --> 02:37:48,527
"I take great pleasure
injoining the Secretary of War, "-

1330
02:37:48,705 --> 02:37:53,699
"the men and women of the US Army,
and the citizens of a grateful nation"-

1331
02:37:53,876 --> 02:37:59,974
"in wishing you good health and
many years of happiness with James."

1332
02:38:00,149 --> 02:38:04,677
"Nothing, not even the safe return
of a beloved son"-

1333
02:38:04,854 --> 02:38:08,915
"can compensate you or the
thousands of other American families"-

1334
02:38:09,092 --> 02:38:12,425
"who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war."

1335
02:38:12,595 --> 02:38:14,529
"I might share with you some words"-

1336
02:38:14,697 --> 02:38:20,226
"which have sustained me through
nights of peril, loss and heartache, "-

1337
02:38:20,403 --> 02:38:24,464
"and I quote,
'I pray that our heavenly Father"-

1338
02:38:24,641 --> 02:38:27,974
"may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement"-

1339
02:38:28,144 --> 02:38:32,012
"and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved and lost"-

1340
02:38:32,181 --> 02:38:34,581
"and the solemn pride
that must be yours"-

1341
02:38:34,751 --> 02:38:40,053
"to have laid a so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom."

1342
02:38:40,223 --> 02:38:42,248
"Abraham Lincoln."

1343
02:38:42,425 --> 02:38:44,950
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,"-

1344
02:38:45,128 --> 02:38:48,495
"George C. Marshall.
General, Chief of Staff."

1345
02:39:39,549 --> 02:39:44,612
My family is with me today.
They wanted to come with me.

1346
02:39:47,623 --> 02:39:52,993
To be honest with you, I wasn't sure
how I would feel coming back here.

1347
02:39:55,264 --> 02:40:01,032
Every day, I think about what you said
to me that day on the bridge.

1348
02:40:02,839 --> 02:40:07,208
I've tried to live my life
the best I could.

1349
02:40:07,377 --> 02:40:10,471
I hope that was enough.

1350
02:40:10,646 --> 02:40:15,015
I hope that at least in your eyes...

1351
02:40:15,184 --> 02:40:19,177
...I've earned what all of you
have done for me.

1352
02:40:32,435 --> 02:40:34,528
James.

1353
02:40:36,005 --> 02:40:39,099
"Captain John H. Miller."

1354
02:40:46,716 --> 02:40:51,710
Tell me I have led a good life.
What?

1355
02:40:51,888 --> 02:40:54,288
Tell me I'm a good man.

1356
02:41:01,364 --> 02:41:03,491
You are.
