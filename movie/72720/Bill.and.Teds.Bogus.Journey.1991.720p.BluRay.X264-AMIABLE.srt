1
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:52,724
It is time.

2
00:00:54,514 --> 00:01:00,524
They've reached the second crucial
turning point in their destiny.

3
00:01:00,729 --> 00:01:05,189
Their message is about to reach millions.

4
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:09,153
But... we will change all that.

5
00:01:10,864 --> 00:01:13,954
When our mission is successful...

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,290
no longer will the world be dominated...

7
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:23,746
by the legacy of these two fools!

8
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,130
No longer will we hear this:

9
00:01:27,881 --> 00:01:29,841
We will stop them now!

10
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,009
Brothers and sisters...

11
00:01:34,262 --> 00:01:36,432
are we ready?

12
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:11,437
- Greetings, my excellent pupils.
- Station.

13
00:03:11,693 --> 00:03:15,863
Today we continue our study of the
physics of acoustical reverberation.

14
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:19,616
I'd like you to meet today's
most non-bogus guest speakers.

15
00:03:19,784 --> 00:03:21,834
Say hello to an old friend, Thomas Edison.

16
00:03:22,745 --> 00:03:23,705
Hello there.

17
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,075
And to help us on the
musical side of things:

18
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,206
Johann Sebastian Bach.

19
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,472
And Sir James Martin of Faith No More...

20
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:39,715
founder of the Faith No More
Spiritual and Theological Center.

21
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:45,314
- Station!
- Station!

22
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:48,482
And a special treat from the 23rd century:

23
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:50,441
Miss Ria Paschelle.

24
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,738
Miss Paschelle, as you all know, is
the inventor of the...

25
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:01,529
statiophonicoxygeneticamp-
lifiagraphiphonideliverberator.

26
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:04,664
Kind of hard to imagine the world
before we had them, isn't it?

27
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,170
OK, remember, this Friday, Ben Franklin
and Aretha Franklin will be here.

28
00:04:10,376 --> 00:04:15,336
Saturday is the field trip to Babylonia.
And very important:

29
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:19,762
Do not do your homework
without wearing headphones...

30
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:21,347
Repeat...

31
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:21,114
De Nomolos. My old teacher.

32
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:26,196
Rufus. My favorite pupil.

33
00:05:27,036 --> 00:05:28,996
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

34
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,084
No.

35
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,920
Just in preparation.

36
00:05:36,212 --> 00:05:40,842
I worked within the system
until I could stand it no longer.

37
00:05:41,092 --> 00:05:42,892
And soon...

38
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:49,097
soon, the system will never have existed.

39
00:05:50,143 --> 00:05:52,983
- You won't get away with it.
- Time will tell.

40
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:54,727
Time has told.

41
00:05:55,023 --> 00:06:00,783
I'll go back and change that,
with the aid of my secret weapons!

42
00:06:05,366 --> 00:06:07,616
How's it going, dudes?

43
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:31,064
Friends, friends, friends.
These are automatons.

44
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:35,482
Replicas only. Furnished with my agenda.

45
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:38,442
Now, what is your mission?

46
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:43,783
- First, we totally kill Bill and Ted.
- Yeah, then we take over their lives.

47
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,280
Then we utterly destroy them.

48
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:49,331
Then, at the Battle of the Bands, we give
the speech they were gonna give

49
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,365
except totally different.

50
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:55,576
And thus a new future is born.
A great future.

51
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,214
Don't tell us, duder. You programmed us.

52
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:01,131
- He's totally a robot!
- So are you, dude!

53
00:07:01,422 --> 00:07:03,262
We're total metal heads!

54
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,970
Do shut up.

55
00:07:09,722 --> 00:07:11,102
Now.

56
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:14,348
- What is the fuel?
- Fear!

57
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:17,232
- What is the engine?
- Discipline!

58
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,732
- What is the ideal?
- Order!

59
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:22,112
And how do we achieve it?

60
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:32,949
Death to Bill and Ted!

61
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:38,964
Catch you later, evil dude.

62
00:08:21,502 --> 00:08:24,012
I am Bill S. Preston...

63
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,883
Esquire!

64
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:32,222
This is Ted "Theodore" Logan!

65
00:08:34,891 --> 00:08:37,101
On drums and keyboards...

66
00:08:37,393 --> 00:08:40,943
celebrating their fifth year
in the 20th century...

67
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,190
the beautiful princesses
from medieval England.

68
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,152
Joanna and Elizabeth.

69
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:49,823
And we are...

70
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:53,278
Wyld Stallyns.

71
00:08:56,662 --> 00:08:57,582
Guys!

72
00:08:57,788 --> 00:09:01,208
You keep telling me you're gonna be
the greatest band in the world, but you stink.

73
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:02,537
Yeah.

74
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:04,632
We don't understand it either.

75
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,087
I mean, you can't sing.

76
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,970
- The girls can play. But you guys?
- Girls mature faster than guys.

77
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,681
Plus, they started in the 15th century.

78
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:16,184
What do you mean?

79
00:09:16,432 --> 00:09:19,732
- They're from medieval England.
- Ted, shut up.

80
00:09:20,228 --> 00:09:22,018
Medieval England, Iowa.

81
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,361
Guys, the point is the
Battle of the Bands is

82
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,685
the biggest event for
new groups in the area.

83
00:09:26,943 --> 00:09:29,653
We're talking
about a $25,000 first prize...

84
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,204
a two-year record deal
and a chance to be seen by

85
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,076
the most important people in the business.

86
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,253
I mean, we've even got
live coverage on Channel 12.

87
00:09:37,453 --> 00:09:40,373
Now, if you were me,
would you put you guys on?

88
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,753
No way.

89
00:09:43,084 --> 00:09:46,804
However, since you guys do work for
Pretzels 'N' Cheese, I'll give you a shot.

90
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:48,834
Excellent!

91
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:56,056
But last. Midnight. Probably by that time,
everyone will be gone home.

92
00:09:56,264 --> 00:09:58,814
That's all right.
I mean, we're used to that.

93
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,440
Yeah, we fully cleaned out Ted's little
brother's junior high school dance.

94
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:06,147
They totally turned on "La Bamba"
while he was playing his solo.

95
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,147
Shut up, Ted!

96
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:12,452
Guys, do yourself a favor.
Prepare a little.

97
00:10:12,655 --> 00:10:15,655
Work on your act.
I mean, think of something.

98
00:10:15,908 --> 00:10:19,198
Don't worry, Ms. Wardroe.
We won't let you down.

99
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,920
- Dude, we gotta win at that concert.
- Then we could finally propose to the ladies.

100
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:28,917
I know.

101
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,800
There's no way we can raise a family on the
money we make at Pretzels 'N' Cheese, dude.

102
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:37,142
I'll call Missy, tell her
we're on our way.

103
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:40,636
Should be a most resplendent
birthday party.

104
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:45,273
- Shall we, ladies?
- Great, sure.

105
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,300
So I understand you two have a little
something else to celebrate tonight.

106
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:12,339
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

107
00:11:13,424 --> 00:11:14,304
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

108
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,100
If we win, I can totally
pay you back the money I owe you.

109
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,354
And what if you don't win?

110
00:11:22,391 --> 00:11:26,691
Well, um, I guess...

111
00:11:29,982 --> 00:11:31,072
Maybe sell some more blood.

112
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:34,605
Perhaps you should think about
selling a couple of the instruments.

113
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:38,702
Of course, we've always got
a spot for you, Ted.

114
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,450
You remember my old friend, Colonel
Oats from the Alaskan Military School?

115
00:11:44,997 --> 00:11:46,417
Oh, um...

116
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:50,383
- "How's it going?", Ted?
- Yeah.

117
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:52,418
Splendidly.

118
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,091
Remember...

119
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:57,931
it's not too late for you, Ted.

120
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:01,675
Yeah.

121
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:04,181
Whoa.

122
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:05,977
For either of you.

123
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:09,193
For all four of you.

124
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,025
Fresh fudge.

125
00:12:20,282 --> 00:12:22,282
- Hi, Oatsie.
- Hi.

126
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,869
Darling.

127
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,332
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Missy.

128
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,212
Hey, Missy. I mean, Mom.

129
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:39,639
I can't believe Missy divorced your dad...

130
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,474
and married mine.

131
00:12:42,471 --> 00:12:44,011
Shut up, Ted.

132
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,480
- Your dad looks bad.
- I know.

133
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,653
What's next?

134
00:12:55,943 --> 00:13:00,783
- Maybe she'll marry you.
- Yeah, then you'll be your own stepdad.

135
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,288
You've probably noticed we haven't
given you our gifts yet.

136
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:11,957
Yeah. That's because...

137
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:16,668
Uh... well...

138
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:20,717
That's because what we
wanted to say was, uh...

139
00:13:22,762 --> 00:13:26,352
well... uh...

140
00:13:29,143 --> 00:13:30,353
Excuse us, dude.

141
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,702
I wrote this myself.

142
00:13:41,906 --> 00:13:43,986
I wrote this last night.

143
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:50,123
"Elizabeth..."

144
00:13:50,414 --> 00:13:51,334
"Joanna...

145
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,545
as I wander through this dark
and lonely forest of life..."

146
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:59,094
"surrounded by various beasts..."

147
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:02,380
"bears, vipers, squirrels..."

148
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:05,103
"Not to mention barnacles and algae..."

149
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:09,351
"man-of-wars, starfish,
blowfish, catfish..."

150
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:11,774
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

151
00:14:12,812 --> 00:14:16,942
The point is, I know we promised you
a better life than this.

152
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:23,322
What I mean to say is, I realize
when we took you out of England...

153
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:26,951
we said the future held
some really good stuff.

154
00:14:27,201 --> 00:14:30,331
Although stuff hasn't
worked out the way we thought...

155
00:14:31,038 --> 00:14:33,958
it will, we hope.

156
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,963
The day after tomorrow,
if things work out...

157
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,802
What this is about is...

158
00:14:48,848 --> 00:14:50,518
- Will you...?
- Marry us?

159
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:59,281
- Theodore...
- I'd love to.

160
00:15:22,381 --> 00:15:23,381
Yeah!

161
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:45,403
- Aim for the cat, dude! Aim for the cat!
- I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

162
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:51,954
Aw, just missed!

163
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:06,421
- Not bad.
- Yeah, let's make it bad.

164
00:16:17,561 --> 00:16:18,981
We're here, dude.

165
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:21,404
Is Rufus with you?

166
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:23,693
One second.

167
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:39,332
Looks like we lost him in the
circuits of time, duder.

168
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:42,883
Good. Then he's gone forever.

169
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:46,467
Our first act of business:

170
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:49,894
Destroy that ridiculous, insipid band!

171
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,392
You got it, dude!

172
00:16:53,347 --> 00:16:54,557
Get to work.

173
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,520
Now!

174
00:16:57,768 --> 00:16:59,438
Study these books well.

175
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:02,193
When my mission is completed...

176
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,191
this will be the new history.

177
00:17:06,694 --> 00:17:08,154
What a shithead.

178
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,202
- Bye!
- Bye!

179
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:17,873
Drive safe!

180
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:20,365
- Dude.
- What?

181
00:17:20,624 --> 00:17:24,044
I wonder if after we're married,
the princesses will stay over with us?

182
00:17:24,253 --> 00:17:26,713
Yeah, our girlfriends are most chaste.

183
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:29,882
- Yeah. At least they're not dating our dads.
- Good point, dude.

184
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:31,890
Yeah.

185
00:17:36,682 --> 00:17:39,272
- Hello?
- Hello, Bill. This is Joanna.

186
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:42,478
Hey, Joanna! How'd you call us so fast?

187
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,821
It's not important. This is:

188
00:17:45,107 --> 00:17:49,357
Elizabeth and I have spoken, and we've
decided we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

189
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,530
What?

190
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:51,859
- Yes!
- Why?

191
00:17:52,114 --> 00:17:55,034
We think you're losers and
we never want to see you again.

192
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,204
No way!

193
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,660
We're going to the desert to be alone.

194
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,998
- But...
- It's over. Goodbye.

195
00:18:09,381 --> 00:18:14,091
- I totally fooled those other usses.
- Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

196
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:15,853
Not!

197
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:19,352
- Let's fitch the booth and start phase two.
- Station.

198
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:50,256
An incredible fortune in stones.

199
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:54,802
Yet I would trade them all
for a hand phaser.

200
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:58,431
Or a good solid club.

201
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:02,809
Maybe we should've proposed
to them sooner.

202
00:19:04,812 --> 00:19:06,772
How could we, Ted?

203
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:09,532
We could barely afford our own apartment.

204
00:19:10,234 --> 00:19:14,074
This is most non-non-heinous.

205
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,775
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta find them.

206
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,235
Talk to 'em.

207
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:21,164
But how?

208
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,352
Wonder who that could be?

209
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,570
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

210
00:19:52,943 --> 00:19:55,363
Ted, it's us again.

211
00:19:56,155 --> 00:19:59,235
- How's it going, Bill?
- Not bad, Bill. And you?

212
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,449
Bad.

213
00:20:01,577 --> 00:20:05,827
We came to help you guys in your most
unfortunate situation.

214
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:06,829
Yeah.

215
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,506
How?

216
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,757
Come with us. We'll show you.

217
00:20:17,968 --> 00:20:19,088
Okay.

218
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:21,392
Excuse us.

219
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:22,387
Dude.

220
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:28,148
- I got a weird feeling here.
- Why?

221
00:20:28,729 --> 00:20:29,979
I don't know.

222
00:20:30,981 --> 00:20:33,901
How do we know these guys are really us?

223
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:40,283
Ted, we've been through this before.

224
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:43,240
Now if it wasn't for the previous
intervention of our future selves...

225
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:47,333
would we have even passed history?
Or met the babes?

226
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:51,418
Or had a most excellent adventure
through time?

227
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:53,379
Okay.

228
00:20:56,048 --> 00:21:00,428
Ted, if you're really me, how many
fingers am I about to hold up?

229
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:01,637
Three.

230
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:03,641
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

231
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,181
You're right!

232
00:21:07,601 --> 00:21:09,561
Let's go, guys. We'll drive.

233
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,112
- Ted.
- What?

234
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:22,162
I have a feeling we're about to embark
on a most unprecedented expedition.

235
00:21:24,243 --> 00:21:25,703
- Dude.
- What?

236
00:21:27,162 --> 00:21:30,082
I got a full-on robot chubby.

237
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:32,423
Later, Evil Ted.

238
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,670
Later.

239
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm cold.

240
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,520
Yeah.

241
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:55,396
Hey! Dudes! Can we have
some heat back here?

242
00:21:55,649 --> 00:21:57,109
Shut up, Bill.

243
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,614
That other you's a real jerk.

244
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:07,663
Yeah! I better remember to be more
considerate towards myself when I become him.

245
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,911
He said, shut your holes!

246
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:12,041
Dude.

247
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:14,924
I got a very bad feeling.

248
00:22:49,077 --> 00:22:50,157
Out.

249
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:01,089
So, where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

250
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,340
They're not here.

251
00:23:02,549 --> 00:23:07,469
Yeah. We lied. Here's the truth,
we're totally gonna kill you now.

252
00:23:08,722 --> 00:23:10,602
- No way!
- Yes way, Ted.

253
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:15,441
- We're fully programmed to do it.
- Yeah, and we want to do it, too.

254
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:18,069
You dick, Bill!

255
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:26,322
- You're metal, dude!
- I know. Check it out!

256
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:30,953
Whoa!

257
00:23:36,508 --> 00:23:37,628
Let's go.

258
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:39,837
Bogus.

259
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:15,406
Ted...

260
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:17,543
we gotta do something.

261
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,668
Dudes, even though you're doing this...

262
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,302
we, we...

263
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,009
we love you.

264
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,970
We love you.

265
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,643
Fags!

266
00:24:37,811 --> 00:24:40,981
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

267
00:24:58,623 --> 00:25:01,883
Yes! I totally loogied on that
good dead me!

268
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,623
Yeah!

269
00:25:04,171 --> 00:25:07,401
- We're fully, full-on evil robots.
- Yeah!

270
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:15,391
- You wanna take the van?
- No, it's beat.

271
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,071
There's a Porsche.

272
00:25:21,313 --> 00:25:22,443
Let's bag it.

273
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:25,732
Station.

274
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,232
Bill...

275
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,190
what happened?

276
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:10,823
Ted...

277
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,657
we're dead, dude.

278
00:26:17,452 --> 00:26:21,212
- No way.
- Yes way.

279
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:22,794
Look.

280
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:31,216
Now what?

281
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:36,428
Who's that?

282
00:26:43,603 --> 00:26:44,773
Whoa!

283
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:48,192
Who are you?

284
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:49,777
Ted...

285
00:26:51,528 --> 00:26:53,528
it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

286
00:26:53,738 --> 00:26:54,408
Oh.

287
00:26:56,992 --> 00:26:58,702
How's it hanging, Death?

288
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,333
You will come with me.

289
00:27:05,375 --> 00:27:08,545
We can't. We gotta get back to the babes.

290
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:11,213
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

291
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,513
We gotta stop those evil usses.
We gotta try.

292
00:27:17,012 --> 00:27:20,142
Excuse us, dude,
but is there any way back?

293
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:25,601
You may challenge me to a contest.

294
00:27:26,229 --> 00:27:27,809
But if you lose...

295
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:31,610
you will remain here in the afterlife...

296
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:33,572
forever.

297
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,373
What if we win?

298
00:27:41,453 --> 00:27:45,083
No one has ever won.

299
00:27:46,374 --> 00:27:49,844
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy.
- Definitely.

300
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,500
But how?

301
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:55,877
Melvin.

302
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,556
Excuse us, dude...

303
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,346
but your shoes are untied.

304
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:07,346
Oh.

305
00:28:15,862 --> 00:28:19,122
I can't believe we just Melvined Death.

306
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,162
Yeah!

307
00:28:21,743 --> 00:28:23,663
Let's just hope he doesn't
catch up with us.

308
00:28:40,595 --> 00:28:42,505
Whoa.

309
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:07,082
No way!

310
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:11,667
This isn't funny.

311
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:13,378
Way to go, Joanna!

312
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,300
I don't understand
what's come over you two.

313
00:29:16,548 --> 00:29:20,428
You see, we used to be puss-weeds,
but now we're metal.

314
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,697
So get over here and put out!

315
00:29:24,681 --> 00:29:27,811
Let's go. You can forget
about us playing tonight.

316
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:29,687
Fine.

317
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,693
Then I guess that's that.

318
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,953
Yeah, see 'ya.

319
00:29:54,502 --> 00:29:56,592
Catch you later, babes!

320
00:30:06,139 --> 00:30:08,309
Ted, I have an idea.

321
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,388
Tonight at the concert after we make
De Nomolos' speech...

322
00:30:12,228 --> 00:30:14,188
let's waste them.

323
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:19,149
Station. In the meantime, let's trash
this lame little rathole.

324
00:30:19,402 --> 00:30:20,822
Stellar, Evil Ted!

325
00:30:27,452 --> 00:30:32,042
- Ted, we have got to stop them.
- Yeah. But how?

326
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,749
I hope this works.

327
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:40,922
It worked in The Exorcist. I and Ill!

328
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:47,511
Alright, Hirschfeld,

329
00:30:47,722 --> 00:30:51,682
you'll move downtown so DeLoach
can take her maternity leave.

330
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:55,193
Also, we need to make a few shifts.
Anyone interested in moonlighting...

331
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:58,858
we'll be stepping up security at the
amphitheater tonight for the Battle of the Bands.

332
00:30:59,108 --> 00:31:02,318
I hear your son's band is playing?

333
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:09,158
Thank you for reminding me, sergeant.
Also, Scott Frank...

334
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:13,834
- So, how do we do this?
- I don't know.

335
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:17,293
Why don't you try something?

336
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:19,633
Okay.

337
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,389
Whoa!

338
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,360
Okay, dudes.

339
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,360
I mean, fellow policemen...

340
00:31:42,944 --> 00:31:45,574
my son, Ted "Theodore" Logan...

341
00:31:45,822 --> 00:31:48,412
and his friend Bill S. Preston, Esquire...

342
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:53,078
have been murdered and replaced
by evil robots from the future.

343
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,998
You totally did it, dude!

344
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:57,044
I totally possessed my dad.

345
00:32:02,213 --> 00:32:03,343
Okay.

346
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:06,432
You got to go over and arrest these robots

347
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:09,184
so they don't ruin
everything for me and Bill.

348
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,930
I mean, my son and Bill.

349
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:16,807
And, most importantly,
they don't hurt the babes.

350
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:19,439
The princesses.

351
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:23,113
This isn't working.

352
00:32:23,359 --> 00:32:25,949
- Back me up, dude.
- You got it, dude.

353
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,672
I totally believe you, dude.

354
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,167
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

355
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:46,628
- Whoa! Doughnuts!
- Whoa! Excellent!

356
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,511
Savory cruller.

357
00:32:49,177 --> 00:32:52,637
- I got really hungry being dead.
- Yeah!

358
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:54,433
Bill?

359
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:57,061
I don't think they believe us.

360
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:00,941
We'll have to find somebody who will.

361
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,476
Catch you later, cop dudes!

362
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:13,078
Ted, we can't go like this.

363
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,869
Oh. Yeah!

364
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,473
Thanks, Dad.

365
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:33,179
- Good morning.
- Sergeant.

366
00:33:38,309 --> 00:33:39,229
Gandhi.

367
00:33:41,646 --> 00:33:43,436
Anne Boleyn.

368
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:45,942
Aristotle.

369
00:33:46,693 --> 00:33:49,533
- President Chester A. Arthur.
- Yes!

370
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,780
Clark Gable.

371
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:55,123
Charlemagne.

372
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,500
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

373
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,835
- Has this séance stuff ever worked?
- No.

374
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:11,682
But it will today, dude.

375
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,345
O great spirits from the netherworld...

376
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,440
leave your celestial
abode and speak upon us...

377
00:34:26,733 --> 00:34:29,903
with your life lessons.

378
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:42,961
I feel the spirits have arrived!

379
00:34:43,124 --> 00:34:44,964
How's it going...

380
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:48,091
New Age dudes?

381
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:51,798
Spirits, can you hear me?

382
00:34:52,008 --> 00:34:53,128
Yeah!

383
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:57,137
And we can totally see down your...

384
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,220
Ted, it's your mom, dude!

385
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,230
Whoa, you're right! Move over, dude.

386
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:09,691
Spirits, what have you to say to us?

387
00:35:09,859 --> 00:35:10,689
OK...

388
00:35:10,902 --> 00:35:14,572
the princesses are in trouble.

389
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:19,159
Yeah. Ted and his most
excellent friend Bill...

390
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,162
were killed!

391
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:24,367
- Listen to us.
- You must go.

392
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:26,212
Beware of evil Bill!

393
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:30,376
Warn the princesses!

394
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,220
O evil spirits from Hell...

395
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:36,586
I send you back into the darkness
from whence you came!

396
00:35:39,972 --> 00:35:44,392
- What's she doing?
- I don't know, but I don't think it's good.

397
00:35:45,895 --> 00:35:47,355
Uh-oh.

398
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,520
No way!

399
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:49,170
- Dude, this is a totally deep hole.
- Yeah!

400
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,300
- Now what?
- I don't know.

401
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:08,805
Hey.

402
00:37:09,145 --> 00:37:13,645
- You wanna play 20 Questions?
- Okay. I got one.

403
00:37:14,108 --> 00:37:15,108
Are you a mineral?

404
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:17,404
Yeah.

405
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,359
Are you a tank?

406
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,322
Whoa, yeah!

407
00:37:21,532 --> 00:37:22,742
Good one!

408
00:37:25,244 --> 00:37:26,504
Whoa!

409
00:37:26,871 --> 00:37:30,001
- Not bad!
- Yeah. Can we do it again?

410
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:35,338
I'm working as hard as I can!

411
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,550
No way!

412
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:44,636
This is not what I expected
this place to look like at all.

413
00:37:44,847 --> 00:37:48,637
Yeah. We got totally lied to
by our album covers, man.

414
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:02,158
Whoa.

415
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:03,948
Who's that?

416
00:38:04,408 --> 00:38:07,748
Ted, who do you think it is, dude?

417
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:10,705
Oh yeah!

418
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,540
How are we gonna get his attention?

419
00:38:15,461 --> 00:38:17,171
Sign of the devil, dude!

420
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:21,678
- Hey, Devil dude! Yo!
- Down here!

421
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:24,102
Down here, dude!

422
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:27,095
Two little guys!

423
00:38:27,348 --> 00:38:29,348
Big dude! Down here!

424
00:38:30,518 --> 00:38:32,498
Right down here, bro!

425
00:38:40,736 --> 00:38:43,946
Dude, I kind of like this.

426
00:38:44,156 --> 00:38:45,906
Whoa!

427
00:38:46,117 --> 00:38:47,787
Excellent!

428
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,329
- Let's get out of here, dude.
- OK.

429
00:38:57,545 --> 00:39:01,795
Ted, if I die, you can have
my Megadeth collection.

430
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,928
But, dude, we're already dead!

431
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,088
Oh.

432
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:09,810
- Well, then they're yours, dude.
- Whoa! Thanks, dude.

433
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,791
How's it going, Beelzebub?

434
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:34,667
So, uh...

435
00:39:34,874 --> 00:39:37,174
Okay. Can we go now?

436
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,420
You may go.

437
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:44,301
Whoa!

438
00:39:44,508 --> 00:39:45,968
- Thanks, dude!
- Yeah!

439
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:50,970
You know, you got a bad rap,
but you're actually an okay dude!

440
00:40:02,985 --> 00:40:03,775
Whoa.

441
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:08,162
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

442
00:40:09,784 --> 00:40:12,244
Maybe we should try one of these tunnels.

443
00:40:20,669 --> 00:40:23,259
- Dude, where are we?
- I don't know.

444
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:26,178
Maybe we should try one of these doors.

445
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:34,101
After you, dude.

446
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:43,901
Now where are we?

447
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:48,278
Who's that?

448
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,369
It's Colonel Oats!

449
00:40:55,121 --> 00:40:56,711
No way!

450
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:58,751
Gentlemen!

451
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,419
Welcome to Hell.

452
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:06,172
- No way.
- What?!

453
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,970
No way, sir?

454
00:41:08,175 --> 00:41:09,965
You two...

455
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:14,637
will do whatever I tell you to do...

456
00:41:14,932 --> 00:41:17,772
from now on.

457
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:20,400
Is that clear?

458
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,730
- Yes, sir, dude!
- What?!

459
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:28,281
- Yes, dude, sir!
- What?!

460
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:30,703
Yes, sir, sir dude!

461
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,696
Get down and give me...

462
00:41:33,951 --> 00:41:36,081
infinity.

463
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:43,170
Stupid, pathetic, craven little cretins.

464
00:41:43,377 --> 00:41:44,337
Dude.

465
00:41:44,712 --> 00:41:50,012
- There's no way I can possibly do infinity pushups!
- Pitiful little morons.

466
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:52,932
- Maybe if he lets us do 'em girlie-style.
- Jokers!

467
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:57,559
You petty, base, bully,
bullock, bugger billies.

468
00:41:57,808 --> 00:42:01,518
You're not strong! You're silky boys!

469
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:06,232
Silk comes from the butts
of Chinese worms.

470
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:08,612
Dude, we gotta get out of here.

471
00:42:08,819 --> 00:42:11,699
I'll eat you up like the warm,
toasty little butter cakes you are.

472
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:14,327
Get back here!

473
00:42:18,204 --> 00:42:19,834
- Dude.
- What?

474
00:42:20,122 --> 00:42:22,752
I think we're in our own personal hell.

475
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,090
- Let's split up.
- Yeah. That way he can't get us so bad.

476
00:42:47,525 --> 00:42:49,435
What happened?

477
00:43:16,428 --> 00:43:18,178
Bogus!

478
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:28,650
# Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you! #

479
00:43:33,112 --> 00:43:38,782
# Happy birthday, dear Granny! #

480
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:44,623
# Happy birthday to you! #

481
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:50,246
Granny S. Preston, Esquire.

482
00:43:50,546 --> 00:43:51,956
No way.

483
00:44:02,349 --> 00:44:03,349
Theodore!

484
00:44:05,519 --> 00:44:07,439
You made your little brother cry.

485
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:09,610
How about...

486
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:11,652
a kiss...

487
00:44:12,234 --> 00:44:16,784
for your dear old granny, Bill?

488
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:25,084
Come along.

489
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,720
You stole Deacon's Easter basket.

490
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:39,426
No way. This was 10 years ago!

491
00:44:39,637 --> 00:44:40,927
Uh-huh!

492
00:44:48,312 --> 00:44:49,312
Come here!

493
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:57,991
That was non, non, non... Non-heinous!

494
00:44:58,238 --> 00:44:59,488
Choose...

495
00:44:59,782 --> 00:45:00,952
your...

496
00:45:01,241 --> 00:45:03,291
eternity.

497
00:45:06,747 --> 00:45:09,957
Choose your own, you fag!

498
00:45:18,759 --> 00:45:23,599
You ugly, red source of all evil!

499
00:45:30,604 --> 00:45:33,274
Hello, girls.

500
00:45:42,991 --> 00:45:44,093
- Dude.
- What?

501
00:45:44,243 --> 00:45:46,413
- Hell sucks!
- Definitely!

502
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:53,170
- You total no-nosed salamanders!
- Deac's Easter basket! Nya-na-na-na-na

503
00:45:55,045 --> 00:45:56,335
Come to Oatsie!

504
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:02,931
I wanted one right on the lips!

505
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:09,524
- Ted, there's only one way outta here, man!
- Right, dude. We gotta play the Reaper!

506
00:46:16,275 --> 00:46:18,815
Choose your game.

507
00:46:19,361 --> 00:46:21,571
But if you lose...

508
00:46:21,864 --> 00:46:24,494
you will stay here in Hell...

509
00:46:25,367 --> 00:46:27,077
forever.

510
00:46:43,886 --> 00:46:46,176
D-1.

511
00:46:50,851 --> 00:46:51,811
Miss.

512
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:02,401
B...

513
00:47:02,696 --> 00:47:03,776
3.

514
00:47:05,282 --> 00:47:06,952
Miss.

515
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:11,332
C-6.

516
00:47:15,709 --> 00:47:16,879
Hit.

517
00:47:20,798 --> 00:47:23,508
- Dude...
- I know.

518
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:32,679
J-7.

519
00:47:33,769 --> 00:47:35,899
J-7...

520
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:38,441
Hit.

521
00:47:38,607 --> 00:47:40,107
Yeah!

522
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:44,275
A hit. You have sunk my battleship.

523
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:45,990
Excellent!

524
00:47:48,492 --> 00:47:51,622
- I totally knew he put it in the J's.
- Good thinking, Ted.

525
00:47:51,870 --> 00:47:53,790
You must play me again.

526
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:58,418
- What?!
- Um, best two out of three.

527
00:47:58,669 --> 00:47:59,879
No way!

528
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:05,629
Yes way.

529
00:48:14,268 --> 00:48:16,348
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

530
00:48:27,114 --> 00:48:29,204
I believe...

531
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:33,539
Col. Mustard did it
in the study with the candlestick.

532
00:48:41,837 --> 00:48:45,047
Sorry, Death. You lose.
It was Professor Plum.

533
00:48:45,299 --> 00:48:49,219
- I said "Plum."
- No way. You said "Mustard!"

534
00:48:49,469 --> 00:48:50,799
Can we go back now?

535
00:48:53,181 --> 00:48:54,811
Best three out of five.

536
00:48:56,018 --> 00:48:58,228
I don't believe this guy.

537
00:49:10,282 --> 00:49:12,702
- Best of seven?
- Damn right!

538
00:49:17,623 --> 00:49:19,583
Right hand, green.

539
00:49:24,504 --> 00:49:26,514
Left hand, red.

540
00:49:30,886 --> 00:49:33,006
Right foot, green.

541
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,100
Right foot...

542
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:48,033
Oh! Oh, dude!

543
00:49:57,537 --> 00:49:58,617
Yeah!

544
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:00,371
Yeah!

545
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:02,670
Well?

546
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:09,259
I will...

547
00:50:11,176 --> 00:50:12,676
take you back.

548
00:50:20,018 --> 00:50:24,688
- You played very well, Death.
- Especially with your totally heavy death robes.

549
00:50:24,982 --> 00:50:26,732
Don't patronize me.

550
00:50:26,984 --> 00:50:31,244
Whoa, whatever, dude. But you got a
lot to learn about sportsmanship.

551
00:50:32,406 --> 00:50:33,866
This way.

552
00:50:34,992 --> 00:50:36,872
Now we can go back and save the babes.

553
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:41,079
Yeah, but Bill, when we get back, how
will we fight those other usses?

554
00:50:41,331 --> 00:50:45,341
I mean, they're totally stronger
than us. And way smarter than us.

555
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:47,335
Yeah, plus, they already killed us once.

556
00:50:47,546 --> 00:50:49,336
Yeah.

557
00:50:50,007 --> 00:50:51,757
One minute, duder!

558
00:50:52,175 --> 00:50:57,385
Okay, if we were good human usses and we had
to fight two evil robot usses...

559
00:50:57,639 --> 00:51:01,179
what would we do?
- Make good robot usses?

560
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,935
Ted, good thinking, dude!

561
00:51:04,104 --> 00:51:05,314
Excuse us.

562
00:51:05,731 --> 00:51:08,401
- Excuse me, Death?
- Oh, now what?

563
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:11,858
Well, could you take us to someone
who could help us?

564
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:15,492
You have beaten me. I am at your command.

565
00:51:15,782 --> 00:51:16,992
Cool!

566
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:18,870
This way.

567
00:51:20,412 --> 00:51:22,122
- Ted.
- What?

568
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:24,460
Don't fear the Reaper.

569
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:27,377
I heard that.

570
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:37,430
Whoa.

571
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,730
This is most atypical.

572
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,880
Welcome to Heaven.

573
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,091
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

574
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:15,049
Thank you.

575
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:18,430
Through there.

576
00:52:18,678 --> 00:52:19,848
Welcome to Heaven.

577
00:52:20,013 --> 00:52:21,393
- Hello.
- Hello.

578
00:52:21,556 --> 00:52:23,556
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

579
00:52:24,976 --> 00:52:29,436
"Only the most serene and enlightened
souls shall gain audience."

580
00:52:29,731 --> 00:52:31,731
Dude, we're in big trouble.

581
00:52:34,277 --> 00:52:36,277
I think I have an idea, dude.

582
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:45,076
- Hello, welcome to Heaven.
- Psst. Hey.

583
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:46,918
Wise dudes.

584
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,577
- Can we ask you a question?
- OK.

585
00:52:49,918 --> 00:52:51,668
Right this way, please.

586
00:53:02,514 --> 00:53:05,354
Dude, we're in Heaven,
and we just mugged three people.

587
00:53:05,559 --> 00:53:09,189
I know. We better get outta here
before we ruin it for everybody.

588
00:53:12,607 --> 00:53:14,397
Come on, Death.

589
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,280
You look great, dude.

590
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,203
You think so?

591
00:53:23,207 --> 00:53:26,713
Yeah. You do.

592
00:53:29,624 --> 00:53:31,214
Shut up.

593
00:53:32,335 --> 00:53:34,835
- Come on, dude.
- It's not funny.

594
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:38,010
I can't believe I'm doing this stupid...

595
00:53:38,258 --> 00:53:41,178
How did I end up
in this ridiculous situation?

596
00:54:00,947 --> 00:54:02,117
How's it going?

597
00:54:03,742 --> 00:54:05,742
What is the meaning of life?

598
00:54:07,537 --> 00:54:09,327
Dude, I have no idea what it is.

599
00:54:15,879 --> 00:54:19,929
Every rose has its thorn

600
00:54:20,217 --> 00:54:24,257
Just like every night has its dawn

601
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:27,471
Just like every cowboy

602
00:54:27,641 --> 00:54:31,941
Sings a sad, sad song

603
00:54:36,942 --> 00:54:40,112
Every rose has a thorn

604
00:54:42,572 --> 00:54:43,992
Don't I know you?

605
00:54:45,825 --> 00:54:46,945
No.

606
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:32,833
OK. So, God, as if you didn't know...

607
00:55:33,498 --> 00:55:36,878
we're not the three wise people
that you might have thought we were.

608
00:55:37,043 --> 00:55:42,553
No. We mugged three people and took
their clothes. Sorry.

609
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,429
- I'm Bill S. Preston.
- I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

610
00:55:46,678 --> 00:55:50,518
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

611
00:55:51,774 --> 00:55:53,034
Yeah.

612
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:55,734
This lovely lady is the Grim Reaper.

613
00:55:55,979 --> 00:55:58,569
He brought us here when we
challenged him and won.

614
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:01,233
Now? OK.

615
00:56:01,651 --> 00:56:06,701
First of all, congratulations on Earth!
It's a most excellent planet.

616
00:56:06,948 --> 00:56:11,788
- And Bill and I enjoy it on a daily basis.
- Not to mention your other great planets.

617
00:56:11,995 --> 00:56:15,495
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus.

618
00:56:18,418 --> 00:56:22,008
But the point is, okay, we died.

619
00:56:22,255 --> 00:56:24,665
Most unfairly.

620
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,890
But we won the chance to come back.

621
00:56:28,136 --> 00:56:30,926
We need to construct something
to help save the women we love.

622
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:36,139
Yeah, and we don't got a lot of time.
So we were wondering...

623
00:56:36,478 --> 00:56:39,898
could you maybe help us find somebody
who can maybe help us build something?

624
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:43,070
Station.

625
00:56:43,568 --> 00:56:46,198
Well, we were thinking along the lines...

626
00:56:46,363 --> 00:56:49,663
of maybe a scientist or something.

627
00:57:03,129 --> 00:57:04,509
Cool.

628
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:09,549
Thanks, God.

629
00:57:09,886 --> 00:57:13,636
Yeah. You are a just and noble creator.

630
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,428
OK, well...

631
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:18,522
- We'll be going now.
- Yeah, keep up the good work.

632
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:20,860
Catch you later, God.

633
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:34,989
Sorry. They Melvined me.

634
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:43,844
All right, upside-down cake!

635
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,795
- Hey, Evil Ted.
- What?

636
00:57:52,095 --> 00:57:53,845
We're out of dishes.

637
00:57:55,348 --> 00:57:57,268
Check this out.

638
00:58:00,728 --> 00:58:02,518
Not bad, E.T.

639
00:58:05,442 --> 00:58:06,652
Let me try.

640
00:58:13,658 --> 00:58:16,118
You totally didn't see the fan.

641
00:58:21,249 --> 00:58:24,419
Tell my body to get over here and get me!

642
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:27,799
That's all right. I'll get you.

643
00:58:29,466 --> 00:58:31,886
Got your head, dude.

644
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:37,429
I'm totally gonna tackle you, dude.

645
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:45,608
- Touchdown for Evil Ted!
- We're total headbangers.

646
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:52,200
Come on. There you go.

647
00:58:58,161 --> 00:59:01,961
Stop wasting time.
Proceed with the plan now.

648
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:03,918
Okay, dude.

649
00:59:04,959 --> 00:59:08,299
What do you say
we trash their relationships?

650
00:59:11,007 --> 00:59:12,507
I hate them.

651
00:59:12,759 --> 00:59:15,889
I hate the robot versions of them.

652
00:59:16,429 --> 00:59:18,309
You made us, dude.

653
00:59:24,687 --> 00:59:27,817
Well, looks like this is the place, dude.

654
00:59:28,149 --> 00:59:30,989
Now all we gotta do
is find that scientist.

655
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:35,620
- What kind of name is Station, anyway?
- I don't know.

656
00:59:35,865 --> 00:59:38,155
Must be some kind of future guy.

657
00:59:43,873 --> 00:59:45,833
Okay, how many syllables?

658
00:59:48,044 --> 00:59:50,304
Is it a play or a song or...?

659
00:59:52,549 --> 00:59:53,969
It's something big.

660
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,845
My money's on Einstein.

661
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,098
That's Station?

662
01:00:03,017 --> 01:00:06,307
Did you assume that
the most brilliant scientist...

663
01:00:06,479 --> 01:00:10,319
in the entire universe
would be from Earth?

664
01:00:11,401 --> 01:00:12,821
Yeah.

665
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:19,412
Movies?

666
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,750
- Nine words.
- Good, Mr. Franklin.

667
01:00:22,996 --> 01:00:25,286
Fire? Cigarettes?

668
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:28,080
- Clouds, clouds.
- Smoke?

669
01:00:29,210 --> 01:00:32,460
Butch and Sundance: The Early Years.

670
01:00:38,428 --> 01:00:41,718
- Death!
- Sorry.

671
01:00:45,059 --> 01:00:48,059
Smokey and the Bandit III.

672
01:00:48,271 --> 01:00:51,151
Smokey is the bandit!

673
01:01:00,533 --> 01:01:03,373
Excuse us. Martians?

674
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:07,368
First, my friend Bill and I
would like to congratulate you...

675
01:01:07,624 --> 01:01:10,634
on a most well-played round of charades.

676
01:01:10,918 --> 01:01:13,088
Secondly, you've been
referred to Ted and me...

677
01:01:13,379 --> 01:01:17,179
as the most brilliant scientists
in the whole universe.

678
01:01:17,383 --> 01:01:21,803
So, how would you like to come to Earth
with us and help us build good robot usses...

679
01:01:22,055 --> 01:01:25,885
to save two beautiful princesses
from bad robot usses?

680
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:37,110
Sounds good, Station.

681
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,360
Let's go.

682
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,090
Let's rock, Death.

683
01:02:08,768 --> 01:02:09,768
Ted?

684
01:02:11,479 --> 01:02:14,229
- We're alive.
- Yeah.

685
01:02:14,440 --> 01:02:18,950
But I think a buzzard
was pecking at my head.

686
01:02:24,659 --> 01:02:27,079
Dinner's over, worm-dude.

687
01:02:30,790 --> 01:02:32,540
You guys okay?

688
01:02:34,085 --> 01:02:35,875
Where's Death?

689
01:02:45,054 --> 01:02:46,394
You okay, dude?

690
01:02:50,226 --> 01:02:52,186
I'm fine.

691
01:02:57,775 --> 01:03:02,655
OK. First on the agenda, we go back
to town and we clean up.

692
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:05,195
Second, call the princesses and warn 'em.

693
01:03:05,408 --> 01:03:09,288
Third, we purchase stuff
to build good robot usses.

694
01:03:10,204 --> 01:03:12,714
OK. Let's go!

695
01:03:16,043 --> 01:03:18,133
What? What?

696
01:03:32,977 --> 01:03:36,437
Here, kitty, kitty! Here, kitty, kitty!

697
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:38,401
There's one, dude!

698
01:03:40,318 --> 01:03:42,198
Just missed, dude.

699
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:45,360
Dude, we're there.

700
01:03:45,573 --> 01:03:47,283
Okay. I got an idea.

701
01:04:07,386 --> 01:04:11,016
Whoa. How's it going, lady humans?

702
01:04:39,794 --> 01:04:42,804
Okay, Stations, this is
the Builders Emporium...

703
01:04:43,047 --> 01:04:46,927
a repository for earthly electronics
and robot-building materials.

704
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:51,506
Get what you need to make
metal usses, understand? OK.

705
01:04:54,475 --> 01:04:58,645
- Ready for the big night, babes?
- No! We're not going.

706
01:05:01,399 --> 01:05:04,439
I think you guys should stop right there.

707
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:07,950
Catch you later, future wife.

708
01:05:10,074 --> 01:05:11,914
Whoa! Evil breath!

709
01:05:12,243 --> 01:05:13,243
Who are you two?

710
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,542
Well, you see...

711
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:28,933
Come on.

712
01:05:30,887 --> 01:05:34,557
- Any luck?
- No. They're not at our place or at theirs.

713
01:05:34,807 --> 01:05:39,227
I'm gonna try your dad's place.
Maybe they went to talk to Missy.

714
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:49,741
Hello. Logan residence.

715
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:53,331
Evil Bill S. Preston, Esquire, speaking.

716
01:05:55,912 --> 01:05:59,252
- It's them! They're back from the dead.
- Oh.

717
01:05:59,498 --> 01:06:01,668
I guess we get to kill them again.

718
01:06:01,959 --> 01:06:03,129
Excellent!

719
01:06:19,060 --> 01:06:21,440
See you real soon.

720
01:06:22,813 --> 01:06:24,023
Oh yeah?

721
01:06:24,815 --> 01:06:28,525
- Yeah, but this time we're ready for you!
- Yeah!

722
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,659
I think we can be ready for them, too.

723
01:06:34,951 --> 01:06:37,951
Good luck getting to the concert, losers!

724
01:06:44,627 --> 01:06:48,257
- Initiate the final plan, now!
- You got it, great one.

725
01:06:49,924 --> 01:06:52,344
Do not fail me.

726
01:06:53,386 --> 01:06:54,926
Metallic buffoons.

727
01:07:01,018 --> 01:07:04,188
- That other me is a dick.
- Yeah.

728
01:07:06,315 --> 01:07:08,065
I hope the Stations
know what they're doing.

729
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:09,565
Huh?

730
01:07:28,754 --> 01:07:31,174
Station! What are you doing?

731
01:07:33,384 --> 01:07:37,144
Dudes! This is no time
to be playing games!

732
01:08:11,964 --> 01:08:14,684
Station.

733
01:08:15,634 --> 01:08:17,734
- Station!
- Station!

734
01:09:54,358 --> 01:09:55,568
Whoa!

735
01:09:57,278 --> 01:09:58,898
That one's me, right?

736
01:09:59,071 --> 01:10:00,741
Station.

737
01:10:02,575 --> 01:10:04,365
Not bad.

738
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,200
How's it going, Good Robot Bill?

739
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,870
How's it doing?

740
01:10:21,886 --> 01:10:24,426
Kate Axelrod for KJM Channel 12...

741
01:10:24,638 --> 01:10:27,808
reporting live from
the San Dimas Civic Auditorium.

742
01:10:28,058 --> 01:10:31,188
We're rocking at the
4th Annual Battle of the Bands.

743
01:10:31,437 --> 01:10:34,817
So stay tuned and hold tight
until we find out...

744
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:38,277
who will be your winner.

745
01:10:48,370 --> 01:10:49,750
You guys ready? You're up.

746
01:10:49,997 --> 01:10:51,327
Where are the girls?

747
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:55,880
- Oh, they're hanging from the rafters.
- Yeah, we're gonna kill them at the finale.

748
01:10:56,795 --> 01:10:58,755
Good luck, gentlemen.

749
01:11:04,762 --> 01:11:06,932
Bill, check it out.

750
01:11:07,514 --> 01:11:08,854
Whoa!

751
01:11:09,058 --> 01:11:10,428
Not bad.

752
01:11:36,085 --> 01:11:39,585
Let's hear it for Primus! Yeah!

753
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,630
- Station, are they ready?
- Station.

754
01:12:19,878 --> 01:12:21,708
Excellent work, dude.

755
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:25,930
- What about me? I made the wigs.
- Okay, Death.

756
01:12:26,218 --> 01:12:29,488
I helped do the shopping.
I was pushing the cart.

757
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:32,928
- Do these work like we asked?
- Station.

758
01:12:34,351 --> 01:12:35,521
Whoa!

759
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:39,477
You are a most
excellent scientist, Station.

760
01:12:40,232 --> 01:12:43,782
Plus, you got an excellently huge
Martian butt.

761
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,693
Station!

762
01:12:49,366 --> 01:12:52,866
Please feel free to split
in two parts again and relax.

763
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:57,370
Don't overlook my butt.
I work out all the time.

764
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:00,634
And reaping burns a lot of calories.

765
01:13:03,756 --> 01:13:10,096
OK, you two dudes ready to take on those
evil usses and save the babes?

766
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:15,767
Fight evil usses. Save the babes.

767
01:13:16,018 --> 01:13:18,728
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

768
01:13:20,064 --> 01:13:21,904
Let's go get 'em.

769
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:24,859
And now, the last band of the evening.

770
01:13:25,110 --> 01:13:27,860
Wyld Stallyns!

771
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,880
How's it going, worms?

772
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:44,088
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

773
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:46,970
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan!

774
01:13:47,257 --> 01:13:51,927
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

775
01:13:53,555 --> 01:13:55,635
Hold it right there!

776
01:13:58,769 --> 01:14:01,019
We're Wyld Stallyns!

777
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:05,153
No, dudes. We're Wyld Stallyns!

778
01:14:07,820 --> 01:14:11,870
You totally killed us,
you evil metal dickweeds!

779
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:14,657
Yeah, and we're fully gonna do it again!

780
01:14:14,910 --> 01:14:18,710
Plus, we're gonna totally
kill your girlfriends, too.

781
01:14:26,839 --> 01:14:30,219
Don't worry, babes! We'll save you.

782
01:14:32,928 --> 01:14:36,428
Everybody, say hello
to Station's creation!

783
01:14:36,765 --> 01:14:39,685
Good Robot Bill and Ted!

784
01:14:52,239 --> 01:14:55,159
Dude, we may have met our match.

785
01:14:55,576 --> 01:14:58,576
Kudos to you, good human usses.

786
01:15:00,497 --> 01:15:04,877
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

787
01:15:41,330 --> 01:15:43,500
- Elizabeth!
- Theodore!

788
01:15:44,082 --> 01:15:46,882
- Joanna!
- William!

789
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:01,733
Who is that?

790
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:20,409
Who are you?

791
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:22,830
Who am I?

792
01:16:30,254 --> 01:16:32,924
I am De Nomolos.

793
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:35,927
I am their master.

794
01:16:37,553 --> 01:16:40,933
And I must see to it that you die.

795
01:16:42,349 --> 01:16:43,139
What?

796
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:45,385
But first...

797
01:17:10,794 --> 01:17:15,844
We are now transmitting on every
television channel throughout the world.

798
01:17:16,383 --> 01:17:18,223
My word!

799
01:17:22,806 --> 01:17:25,976
I want the whole universe
to behold this...

800
01:17:26,226 --> 01:17:28,476
transfer of power.

801
01:17:30,314 --> 01:17:33,364
No longer will our future society...

802
01:17:33,609 --> 01:17:36,739
be based on the ideas and the music...

803
01:17:36,987 --> 01:17:38,777
of these two fools!

804
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:45,035
They will be based on my ideas...

805
01:17:46,997 --> 01:17:49,417
and my ideas alone!

806
01:17:50,834 --> 01:17:53,594
Dude, how do we get out of this?
We don't got any time.

807
01:17:53,795 --> 01:17:57,415
Yeah we do, dude. Look, after we get away
from this guy, we use the booth...

808
01:17:57,633 --> 01:18:02,053
we time-travel back to before the concert and
set up the things we need to get him now.

809
01:18:02,262 --> 01:18:04,312
Whoa, yeah, like what?

810
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:07,434
Like, uh... like a sandbag.

811
01:18:13,690 --> 01:18:15,030
Excellent!

812
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:16,253
Then we'll get a cage.

813
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:26,368
My friends.

814
01:18:27,079 --> 01:18:29,459
I, too, can play the time game.

815
01:18:29,706 --> 01:18:32,916
If you do that,
once I have vanquished you...

816
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:37,260
I will go back and set up this key.

817
01:18:47,766 --> 01:18:50,436
And another gun.

818
01:19:00,278 --> 01:19:03,368
Right, dude. Only there's one
thing you didn't think of.

819
01:19:03,573 --> 01:19:06,953
Yeah. Only the winners are gonna be
able to go back and set things up.

820
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:09,790
Yeah. And that's gonna be us, dude.

821
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:13,416
We set up the key, and we set up the gun.

822
01:19:16,628 --> 01:19:18,548
Excuse me.

823
01:19:18,797 --> 01:19:21,337
- Your shoelaces are untied.
- What?

824
01:19:28,656 --> 01:19:29,806
Melvined.

825
01:19:43,822 --> 01:19:45,372
You're under arrest, pal.

826
01:19:45,532 --> 01:19:47,282
Way to go, Dad!

827
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:53,920
Book him, Danno.

828
01:20:00,964 --> 01:20:02,594
Good job, Death.

829
01:20:07,888 --> 01:20:09,558
Who was that guy?

830
01:20:09,806 --> 01:20:12,926
Perhaps I can answer
that question, gentlemen.

831
01:20:13,268 --> 01:20:15,308
Ms. Wardroe, thanks for the help.

832
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,190
Yeah. You know, we definitely...

833
01:20:18,982 --> 01:20:20,982
Take it off, baby!

834
01:20:29,534 --> 01:20:31,044
Rufus!

835
01:20:31,244 --> 01:20:32,504
How long you been here, dude?

836
01:20:32,954 --> 01:20:35,084
Got here just in time
for your audition, William.

837
01:20:35,457 --> 01:20:38,747
So you were Ms. Wardroe all along.

838
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:42,630
Hey. Would anyone else have let you
in this contest?

839
01:20:43,423 --> 01:20:44,593
ALL: No.

840
01:20:45,133 --> 01:20:49,893
Now, amigos, that was Mr. Chuck
De Nomolos, my old gym teacher.

841
01:20:50,138 --> 01:20:54,598
And, by the way, sit-up champion
of the 27th century.

842
01:20:54,810 --> 01:20:59,360
And now, gentlemen, I believe
the stage belongs to you.

843
01:20:59,523 --> 01:21:00,903
Thanks, Rufus.

844
01:21:14,079 --> 01:21:16,619
Dude, we still don't know how to play.

845
01:21:17,165 --> 01:21:19,285
Maybe we ought to get good, Ted.

846
01:21:19,584 --> 01:21:20,754
How?

847
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:46,896
That was a fast 16 months
of intensive guitar training, dude.

848
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:51,620
Yeah, except for that two-week
medieval honeymoon.

849
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,040
Hello, San Dimas!

850
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:57,156
Hello!

851
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:59,672
Want to introduce you
to a little friend of mine.

852
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,630
This is little Ted.

853
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:04,592
Hello, little Ted!

854
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:06,718
This is little Bill.

855
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,723
Hello, little Bill!

856
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:14,640
Now for the rest of our band. Ted?

857
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:21,443
On conga and bongos, proof positive
that you can't tell a book by its cover...

858
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:24,360
the dude who can make one word
mean anything...

859
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,529
Station!

860
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,156
Our backup dancers...

861
01:22:33,408 --> 01:22:36,078
Station's most bodacious creations...

862
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:38,996
the Good Robot Usses!

863
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,550
And over here...

864
01:22:46,838 --> 01:22:49,718
our bass player, the Duke of Spooks...

865
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:52,678
the Doc of Shocks, the Man With No Tan...

866
01:22:52,928 --> 01:22:55,758
please say hello to Death himself...

867
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:58,056
the Grim Reaper!

868
01:23:05,649 --> 01:23:08,279
You might be a king
Or a little street sweeper

869
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:11,855
But sooner or later
You dance with the Reaper

870
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:19,325
Get down with your bad self!

871
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:28,989
I love show business.

872
01:23:29,798 --> 01:23:31,588
Ladies and gentlemen...

873
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,298
we've been to the past.

874
01:23:34,678 --> 01:23:36,508
We've been to the future.

875
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,310
We've been all around the afterlife.

876
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:42,733
And you know... Ted?

877
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:45,438
The best place to be...

878
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,780
is here.

879
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:52,739
And the best time to be...

880
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:54,699
is now.

881
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:03,208
And all's we can say is...

882
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:06,418
let's rock!

883
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:09,209
One! Two!

884
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:12,172
One, two, three, four!

885
01:25:36,633 --> 01:25:39,393
Right good! Right good!

886
01:27:46,846 --> 01:27:51,562
Stallyns One... Stallyns One,
you are clear to leave...

887
01:27:52,227 --> 01:27:53,517
Drums...

888
01:27:53,728 --> 01:27:55,518
- Ten... nine...
- Keyboards...

889
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,980
- ...eight...
- Affirmative.

890
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:59,280
Ignition sequence start. Engines on.

891
01:27:59,484 --> 01:28:02,204
- ...five... four... three... two...
- That's a check.

892
01:28:02,403 --> 01:28:04,203
- ...one.
- Good luck boys.

893
01:28:11,996 --> 01:28:13,916
You are go, Stallyns One!

894
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:17,248
Come home soon. We'll miss you.
