30
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,460
It is time.

31
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,930
They've reached the second crucial turning point

32
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,590
in their destiny.

33
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,600
Their message is about to reach millions.

34
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:09,450
But... we will change all that.

35
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,550
When our mission is successful...

36
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,350
...no longer will the world be dominated...

37
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:23,310
...by the legacy of these two fooIs!

38
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,500
No longer will we hear this:

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,930
We will stop them now!

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,190
Brothers and sisters...

41
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,680
...are we ready?

42
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,340
- Greetings, my excellent pupiIs. - Station.

43
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,030
Today we continue our study

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,670
of the physics of acoustical reverberation.

45
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:19,860
Meet today's most non-bogus guest speakers.

46
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,170
Say hello to our friend Thomas Edison.

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,780
Hello there.

48
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,360
To help us on the musical side of things:

49
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,470
Johann Sebastian Bach.

50
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:34,140
And Sir James Martin of Faith No More...

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,170
...founder of the Faith No More Spiritual and Theological Center.

52
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,810
- Station! - Station!

53
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,820
And a special treat from the 23rd century:

54
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,000
Miss Ria Paschelle.

55
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,030
Miss Paschelle, as you all know, is the inventor of the...

56
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,910
...statiophonicoxygeneticamp-lifiagraphiphonideliverberator.

57
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:04,860
Kind of hard to imagine the world before we have them, isn't it?

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,400
Remember, this Friday,

59
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,420
Ben Franklin and Aretha Franklin will be here.

60
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:15,420
Saturday is the field trip to Babylonia. And very important:

61
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,120
Do not do your homework without wearing headphones. Repeat...

62
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:21,320
De Nomolos. My old teacher.

63
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,330
Rufus. My favorite pupil.

64
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,840
- I thought you were... - Dead?

65
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,040
No.

66
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,020
Just in preparation.

67
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,880
I worked within the system until I could stand it no longer.

68
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,600
And soon...

69
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:49,490
...soon the system will never have existed.

70
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,650
- You won't get away with it. - Time will tell.

71
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,490
Time has told.

72
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,200
I'll go back and change that,

73
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,930
with the aid of my secret weapons!

74
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,530
How's it going, dudes?

75
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:31,300
Friends, friends, friends. These are automatons.

76
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:35,780
Replicas only. Furnished with my agenda.

77
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,220
Now, what is your mission?

78
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,630
First, we totally kill Bill and Ted.

79
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,570
Yeah. Then we take over their lives.

80
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,500
Then we utterly destroy them.

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,740
At the Battle of the Bands,

82
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,710
we give their speech they are gonna give,

83
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,670
except totally different.

84
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:55,990
And thus a new future is born. A great future.

85
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,680
Don't tell us, dude. You programmed us.

86
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,560
- He's totally a robot! - So are you, dude!

87
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,030
We're total metal heads!

88
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,090
Do shut up.

89
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,870
Now.

90
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,490
- What is the fuel? - Fear!

91
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,630
- What is the engine? - Discipline!

92
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:20,150
- What is the ideal? - Order!

93
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,120
And how do we achieve it?

94
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,060
Death to Bill and Ted!

95
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,960
Catch you later, evil dude.

96
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,400
I am Bill S. Preston...

97
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,800
...Esquire!

98
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,810
This is Ted "Theodore" Logan!

99
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:37,410
On drums and keyboards...

100
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,390
...celebrating their fifth year in the 20th century...

101
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:44,700
...the beautiful princesses from medieval England.

102
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,200
Joanna and Elizabeth.

103
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,870
And we are...

104
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,490
...Wyld Stallyns.

105
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,980
You keep telling me you're the greatest band in the world,

106
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,670
but you stink.

107
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:04,470
Yeah, we don't understand it either.

108
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,050
I mean, you can't sing.

109
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,760
The girIs can play. But you guys?

110
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,300
GirIs mature faster than guys.

111
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,320
Plus, they started in the 15th century.

112
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,350
What do you mean?

113
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:19,840
- They're from medieval England. - Ted, shut up.

114
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:22,360
Medieval England, Iowa.

115
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,520
Guys, the point is the Battle of the Bands

116
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,670
is the biggest event in the area.

117
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,330
We're talking about a $25,000 first prize...

118
00:09:30,410 --> 00:09:31,640
...a two-year record deal

119
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,330
and chances to be seen by the most important people in the business..

120
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:36,800
I mean, we're even got live on Channel 12.

121
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:40,630
Now, if you were me, would you put you guys on?

122
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,850
No way.

123
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,720
Since you work for PretzeIs 'N' Cheese,

124
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,180
I'll give you a shot.

125
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,500
Excellent!

126
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,610
But last. Midnight.

127
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,340
Probably by that time, everyone will be gone.

128
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,870
That's all right. I mean, we're used to that.

129
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,750
Yeah, we fully cleaned out Ted's brother's junior high school dance.

130
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,440
They fully turned on "La Bamba" while he was playing his solo.

132
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,330
Shut up, Ted!

133
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:12,670
Guys, do yourseIf a favor. Prepare a little.

134
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:15,780
Work on your act. Think of something.

135
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,480
Don't worry, Miss Wardrobe. We won't let you down.

136
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:25,750
Dude, we gotta win that concert.

138
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,570
Yeah, then we could finally propose to the ladies.

139
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,980
No. There is no way we can raise a family

140
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,160
on the money we make from PretzeIs 'N' Cheese.

142
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,350
I'll call Missy, tell her we're on our way.

143
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:40,310
Should be a most resplendent birthday party.

144
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:44,780
- Shall we, ladies? - Great, sure.

148
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,990
I understand you two have something eIse to celebrate tonight.

149
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,490
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

150
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,410
If we win, I'll totally pay you back your money.

151
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,890
What if you don't win?

152
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,980
Well, uh, I guess...

153
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,590
Maybe sell more blood.

154
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,810
Perhaps you should think about selling a couple of instruments.

155
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,260
Of course, we've always got a spot for you, Ted.

156
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,370
Remember my old friend,

157
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,760
Colonel Oats from the Alaskan Military School?

158
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,020
- "How's it going", Ted? - Yeah.

159
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,360
Splendidly.

160
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,060
Remember...

161
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,280
...it's not too late for you, Ted.

162
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,050
For either of you.

163
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,420
For all four of you.

164
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,960
Fresh fudge.

165
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,760
Hi, Oatsie.

166
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,770
Darling.

167
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,880
- Hi, guys. - Hi, Missy.

168
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,340
Hey, Missy. I mean, Mom.

169
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,680
I can't believe Missy divorced your dad...

170
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,360
...and married mine.

171
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,270
Shut up, Ted.

172
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,700
- Your dad looks bad. - I know.

173
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,700
What's next?

174
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,840
- Maybe she'll marry you. - Yeah, then you'll be your own stepdad.

175
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,760
You probably noticed we haven't given you our gifts yet.

176
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,730
That's because...

177
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,530
That's because we wanted to say was...

178
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,690
Excuse us, dude.

179
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,700
I wrote this myseIf.

180
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,820
I wrote this last night.

181
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,620
"Elizabeth..."

182
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,910
"Joanna...

183
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,110
as I wander through this dark and Ionely forest of life...

184
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,390
...surrounded by various beasts...

185
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,470
...bears, vipers, squirreIs..."

186
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,320
"Not to mention barnacles and algae..."

187
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,650
"...man-of-wars, starfish, blowfish, catfish..."

188
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,930
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

189
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,270
The point is, I know we promised you a better life than this.

190
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,950
What I mean to say is,

191
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,330
I realize when we took you out of England...

192
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,400
we said the future held some really good stuff.

193
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,340
Although stuff hasn't worked out how we thought...

194
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,020
it will, we hope.

195
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,350
The day after tomorrow, if things work out...

196
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,400
What this is about is...

197
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,480
- Will you...? - Marry us?

198
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,590
- Theodore... - I'd love to.

199
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,420
Aim for the cat, dude, aim for the cat!

200
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,620
I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

201
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,320
Aw, just missed!

202
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,730
- Not bad. - Yeah, let's make it bad.

203
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,920
We're here, dude.

204
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,470
Is Rufus with you?

205
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,840
One second.

206
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,480
Looks like we lost him in the circuits of time, duder.

207
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,890
Good. Then he's gone forever.

208
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,120
Our first act of business:

209
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
Destroy that ridiculous, insipid band!

210
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,390
You got it, dude!

211
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,630
Get to work.

212
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,570
Now!

213
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,530
Study these books well.

214
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,460
When my mission is completed...

215
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,300
this will be the new history.

216
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,260
What a shithead.

217
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,350
- Bye! - Bye!

218
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,730
Drive safe!

219
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,500
- Dude. - What?

220
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,300
I wonder if after we're married, princesses will stay over with us?

221
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,740
- Yeah. - Our girIfriends are most chaste.

222
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,490
- At least they're not dating our dads. - Good point, dude.

223
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,490
- Hello? - Hello, Bill. This is Joanna.

224
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,710
Hey Joanna! How'd you call so fast?

225
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,020
It's not important. This is:

226
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,480
Elizabeth and I have spoken and

227
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,470
we've decided we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

228
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,470
What?

229
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,030
- Yes! - Why?

230
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,370
We think you're losers

231
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,130
and we don't want to see you again.

232
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,240
No way!

233
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,550
We're going to the desert to be alone.

234
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,540
- But - It's over. Goodbye.

235
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,700
I totally fooled thoes other usses.

236
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,080
Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

237
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,540
Not!

238
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,860
- Let's ditch the booth and start phase two. - Station.

239
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,010
An incredible fortune in stones.

240
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,040
Yet I'd trade them all for a hand phaser.

241
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,140
Or a good solid club.

242
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,300
Maybe we should've proposed to them sooner.

243
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,340
How could we, Ted?

244
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,600
We could barely afford our own apartment.

245
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,570
This is most non-non-heinous.

246
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,950
- What are we gonna do? - We gotta find them.

247
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,470
Talk to them.

248
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,370
But how?

249
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,260
Wonder who that could be?

250
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,420
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

251
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,150
Ted, it's us again.

252
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,520
- How's it going, Bill? - Not bad, Bill. And you?

253
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,820
Bad.

254
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,060
We came to help you guys in your most unfortunate situation.

255
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,670
How?

256
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,970
Come with us. We'll show you.

257
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,650
Ok.

258
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,000
Excuse us. Dude.

259
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,050
- I got a weird feeling here. - Why?

260
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,920
I don't know.

261
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,290
How do we know these guys are really us?

262
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,150
Ted, we've been through this before.

263
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,160
If it wasn't for the previous intervention of our future selves...

264
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,150
would we've even passed history? Or met the babes?

265
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,040
Or had a most excellent adventure through time?

266
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,840
Ok.

267
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,170
Ted, if you're really me,

268
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,520
how many fingers am I about to hold up?

269
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,720
Three.

270
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,440
You're right!

271
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,180
Let's go, guys. We'll drive.

272
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,180
- Ted. - What?

273
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,020
I have a feeling we're about to embark upon

274
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,820
a most unprecedented expedition.

275
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,630
- Dude. - What?

276
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,840
I got a full-on robot chubby.

277
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,680
Later, Evil Ted.

278
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,840
Later.

279
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,130
I'm cold.

280
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,450
Dudes can we have some heat back here?

281
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,090
Shut up, Bill.

282
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,500
That other you's a real jerk.

283
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,900
Yeah.

284
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,860
I get a rumor to be more considerate towards myseIf

285
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,510
when I become him.

286
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,380
He said, shut your holes!

287
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
Dude, I got a very bad feeling.

288
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,260
Out.

289
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,920
So, where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

290
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,360
They're not here.

291
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,300
We lied. Here's the truth,

292
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,730
we're totally gonna kill you now.

293
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,040
- No way! - Yes way, Ted.

294
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,970
We're fully programmed to do it.

295
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,230
Yeah, and we want to do it too.

296
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,540
You dick, Bill!

297
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,230
- You're metal, dude! - I know. Check it out.

298
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,590
Let's go.

299
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,180
Bogus.

300
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,480
Ted.

301
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,590
We gotta do something.

302
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,370
Dudes, even though you're doing this...

303
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,580
we, we...

304
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,140
We love you.

305
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:28,830
We love you.

306
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,820
Fags!

307
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,980
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

308
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,380
Yes! I totally loogied on that good dead me!

309
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,470
- We're fully, full-on evil robots. - Yeah!

310
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,060
- You wanna take the van? - No, it's beat.

311
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,390
There's a Porsche.

314
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,510
Let's bag it.

315
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,370
Station.

316
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,100
Bill...

317
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,980
what happened?

318
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,850
Ted...

319
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,900
we're dead, dude.

320
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,800
- No way. - Yes way.

321
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,370
Look.

322
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,710
Now what?

323
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,270
Who's that?

324
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,360
Who are you?

325
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,230
Ted...

326
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,540
it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

327
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,630
How's it hanging, Death?

328
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,730
You will come with me.

329
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,740
We can't. We gotta get back to the babes.

330
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,370
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

331
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,660
We gotta stop these evil "Usses." We gotta try.

332
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,500
Excuse us, dude, but is there any way back?

333
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,900
You may challenge me to a contest.

334
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,210
But if you lose...

335
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,540
you will remain here in the afterlife...

336
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,270
forever.

337
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,490
What if we win?

338
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,490
No one has ever won.

339
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,240
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy. - Definitely.

340
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,480
But how?

341
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,460
Melvin.

342
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,470
Excuse us, dude...

343
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,950
...but your shoes are untied.

344
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,870
I can't believe we just melvined Death.

345
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,040
Let's just hope he doesn't catch up with us.

347
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,350
No way!

348
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,850
This isn't funny.

349
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,660
Way to go, Joanna!

350
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,750
I don't understand what's come over you two.

351
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,490
You see, we used to be puss-weeds, but now we're metal.

352
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,620
So get over here and put out!

353
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,230
Let's go. You can forget about us playing tonight.

354
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,090
Fine.

355
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,330
Then I guess that's that.

356
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,290
Yeah, see you.

357
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,430
Catch you later, babes!

358
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,710
Ted, I have an idea.

359
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,730
Tonight the concert after we make De Nomolos' speech...

360
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,650
...let's waste them.

361
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,330
Station. In the meantime, let's trash this lame rathole.

362
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,070
Stellar, Evil Ted!

363
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,010
- Ted, we have got to stop them. - Yeah. But how?

364
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,950
I hope this works.

365
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,020
It worked in The Exorcist. I and III!

366
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,510
All right, Herschfeld.

367
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,560
You'll move downtown so DeLoach can take her maternity leave.

368
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,430
AIso, we need to make a few shifts,

369
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,330
anyone interested in moonlighting...

370
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,690
...we're stepping up security of the amphitheater tonight

371
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,070
for the Battle of the Bands.

372
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,990
I hear your son's band is playing.

373
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,070
Thank you for reminding me, sergeant.

374
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,570
AIso, Scott Frank...

375
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,680
- So, how do we do this? - I don't know.

376
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,880
Why don't you try yourseIf?

377
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,540
Okay.

378
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,880
Okay, dudes.

379
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,590
I mean, fellow policemen...

380
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,580
...my son, Ted "Theodore" Logan...

381
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,650
...and his friend Bill Preston, Esquire...

382
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,780
...have been murdered and

383
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,330
replaced by evil robots from the future.

384
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,360
You totally did it, dude!

385
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,550
I totally possessed my dad.

386
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,350
Okay.

387
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,590
You got to go over and arrest these robots

388
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,190
so they don't ruin everything for me and Bill.

389
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,100
I mean, my son and Bill.

390
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,090
And, most importantly, they don't hurt the babes.

391
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,460
The princesses.

392
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,380
This isn't working.

393
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,190
- Back me up, dude. - You got it, dude.

394
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,570
I totally believe you, dude.

395
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:46,860
- Doughnuts! - Excellent!

396
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,810
Savory cruller.

397
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:52,480
- I got really hungry being dead. - Yeah!

398
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,880
Bill, I don't think they believe us.

399
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,700
We have to find someone who will.

400
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,870
Catch you later, cop dudes!

401
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,690
Ted, we can't go like this.

402
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,910
Thanks, Dad.

403
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:32,960
- Good morning. - Sergeant.

404
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,540
Gandhi.

405
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,370
Anne Boleyn.

406
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,980
Aristotle.

407
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,720
President Chester A. Arthur.

408
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,040
Clark Gable.

409
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,960
Charlemagne.

410
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:58,130
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

411
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,700
- Has this séance stuff ever worked? - No.

412
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,250
But it will today, dude.

413
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,500
Oh, great spirits from the netherworld...

414
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,860
...leave your celestial abode and speak upon us...

415
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,790
...with your life lessons.

416
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,100
I feel the spirits have arrived!

417
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:45,030
How's it going...

418
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,120
...New Age dudes?

419
00:34:48,860 --> 00:34:52,180
Spirits, can you hear me?

420
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,570
Yeah.

421
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:57,380
And we can totally see down your...

422
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,040
It's your mom, dude!

423
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,210
You're right! Move over, dude.

424
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,790
Spirits, what have you to say to us?

425
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:15,030
Okay. The princesses are in trouble.

426
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:19,740
Ted and his most excellent friend Bill...

427
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:22,320
...were killed!

428
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,530
- Listen to us. - You must go.

429
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:27,080
Beware of the devil ghosts!

431
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:31,120
You warn the princesses!

432
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:33,500
Oh, evil spirits from Hell...

433
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,780
...I send you back into the darkness from where you came!

434
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:44,070
- What's she doing? - I don't know, but I don't think it's good.

435
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:50,850
No way!

436
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,600
Dude, this is a totally deep hole.

437
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:55,060
- Now what? - I don't know.

438
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:13,360
- You wanna play 20 Questions? - Okay. I got one.

439
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:15,250
Are you a mineral?

440
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:17,770
Yeah.

441
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,630
Are you a tank?

442
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,430
Yeah.

443
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,490
Good one!

444
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,880
- Not bad! - Can we do it again?

445
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,890
I'm working as hard as I can!

446
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:37,300
No way!

447
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:45,910
This is not what I expected this place to look like at all.

448
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,370
We got totally lied to by our album covers, man.

449
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,630
Who's that?

450
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,540
Ted, who do you think it is, dude?

451
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,280
How do we get his attention?

452
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,750
Sign of the devil, dude!

453
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:20,830
- Hey, Devil dude! - Down here!

454
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:24,050
Down here, dude!

455
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:26,030
Two little guys!

456
00:38:26,990 --> 00:38:30,510
Big dude! Down here!

457
00:38:40,810 --> 00:38:43,880
Dude, I kind of like this.

458
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,650
Excellent!

459
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,420
Let's get out of here, dude.

460
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,370
Okay.

461
00:38:57,570 --> 00:39:00,070
Ted, if I die,

462
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:02,130
you can have my Megadeth collection.

463
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:04,170
But, dude, we're already dead!

464
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:09,560
- Well, then they're yours, dude. - Whoa! Thanks, dude.

465
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,450
How's it going, Beelzebub?

466
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:37,430
So, um... Okay. Can we go now?

467
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:41,440
You may go.

468
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,840
Thanks, dude!

469
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:50,890
You know, you got a bad rap, but you're actually an okay dude!

470
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,020
- Where are we? - I don't know.

471
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,120
Maybe we should try one of these tunneIs.

472
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:22,960
- Dude, where are we? - I don't know.

473
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,390
Maybe we should try one of these doors.

474
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,710
After you, dude.

475
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,520
Now where are we?

476
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,490
Who's that?

477
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,940
It's Colonel Oats!

478
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,070
No way!

479
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,140
Gentlemen!

480
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,560
Welcome to Hell.

481
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,280
- No way. - What?!

482
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,240
No way, sir?

483
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,590
You two...

484
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:15,140
...will do whatever I tell you to do...

485
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,100
...from now on.

486
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,310
Is that clear?

487
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,570
- Yes, sir, dude! - What?!

488
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:28,140
- Yes, dude, sir! - What?!

489
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,960
Yes, sir, sir dude!

490
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,790
Get down and give me...

491
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,950
...infinity.

492
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:43,840
Stupid, pathetic, craven little cretins.

493
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:46,500
There is no way I can possibly

494
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,460
- do infinity pushups! - Pitiful little morons.

495
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,210
- Maybe he let's do girlie style. - Jokers!

496
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,720
You petty, base,

497
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,850
bully, bullock, bugger billies.

498
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:02,340
You're not strong! You're silky boys!

499
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:07,010
Silk comes from the butts of Chinese worms.

500
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:08,850
We gotta get out of here.

501
00:42:08,850 --> 00:42:11,900
Worm, toasty little butter cakes you are.

502
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,820
Get back here!

503
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,190
- Dude. - What?

504
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,530
I think we're in our own personal hell.

505
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,910
- Let's split up. - Yeah.

506
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:27,090
- That way can't get us so bad. - Yeah.

507
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,460
What happened?

508
00:43:16,370 --> 00:43:18,570
Bogus!

509
00:43:45,810 --> 00:43:50,240
Granny S. Preston, Esquire.

510
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,320
No way.

512
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:04,240
Theodore!

513
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:07,880
You made your brother cry.

514
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:09,890
How about...

515
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,570
a kiss...

516
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:16,730
for your dear old granny, Bill?

517
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,490
My dear...

518
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:24,920
Come along.

519
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:36,150
You stole Deacon's Easter basket.

520
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:39,840
No way. This was 10 years ago!

521
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:49,530
Come here now!

522
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:58,200
That was non, non, non... Non-heinous!

523
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,910
Choose...

524
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,300
your...

525
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,730
eternity.

526
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:09,830
Choose your own, you fag!

527
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,390
You ugly, red source of all evil!

528
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,330
Hello, girIs.

529
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:44,370
- Dude. - What?

530
00:45:44,370 --> 00:45:46,420
- Hell sucks! - Definitely!

531
00:45:46,770 --> 00:45:51,700
- You all no-nosed salamanders! - Deac's Easter basket!

532
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,930
Come on to Oatsie!

533
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,700
I wanted one right on the lips!

534
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,630
Ted, there's only one way out of here, man!

535
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:09,270
Right, dude. We gotta play the Reaper!

536
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,530
Choose your game.

537
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:21,420
But if you lose...

538
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,590
you will stay here in Hell...

539
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:26,800
forever.

540
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,790
D1
D-1.

542
00:46:50,930 --> 00:46:52,130
Miss.

543
00:47:01,010 --> 00:47:03,820
B3
B... 3.

544
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:07,100
Miss.

545
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:11,190
C6
C-6.

546
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:16,830
Hit.

547
00:47:20,690 --> 00:47:23,400
- Dude... - I know.

548
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,840
J7
J-7.

549
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,700
J7
J-7...

550
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:38,960
Hit.

551
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,860
A hit. You have sunk my battleship.

552
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,810
Excellent!

553
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:51,930
- I total knew he put it in the J's, dude. - Good thinking, Ted.

554
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:54,040
You must play me again.

555
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:58,740
- What?! - Best two out of three.

556
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,200
No way!

557
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,620
Yes way.

559
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,210
- What's he doing? - I don't know.

560
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,050
I believe...

561
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:33,850
Col. Mustard did it in the study with the candlestick.

562
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,260
Sorry, Death. You lose. It was Professor Plum.

563
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,770
I said "Plum."

564
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:49,400
No way. You said "Mustard!"

565
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,030
Can we go back now?

566
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,490
Best three out of five.

567
00:48:56,050 --> 00:48:57,770
I don't believe this guy.

568
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:12,980
- Best of seven? - Damn right!

570
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,380
Right hand, green.

571
00:49:24,540 --> 00:49:26,290
Left hand, red.

572
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,120
Right foot, green.

573
00:49:33,610 --> 00:49:35,000
Right foot...

574
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,420
Dude!

575
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,740
Well?

576
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:09,030
I will...

577
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,880
take you back.

578
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,970
You played very well, Death.

579
00:50:21,970 --> 00:50:24,980
Especially with your totallly heavy death robes.

580
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:27,080
Don't patronize me.

581
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:31,110
Whatever dude. You got a lot to learn about sportsmanship.

582
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:33,710
This way.

583
00:50:35,210 --> 00:50:37,050
Now we can go back and save the babes.

584
00:50:37,050 --> 00:50:38,950
Yeah. But, Bill, when we get back,

585
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,230
how we gonna fight those other usses?

586
00:50:41,230 --> 00:50:45,040
I mean, they're totally stronger than us. And way smarter than us.

587
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,180
- Yeah. Plus, they already killed us once. - Yeah.

588
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,520
One minute, duder!

589
00:50:52,150 --> 00:50:55,000
OK! If we were good human usses,

590
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,700
we had to fight two evil robot usses...

591
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,120
what would we do?

592
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:01,110
Make good robot usses?

593
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,770
Ted. Good thinking, dude!

594
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,480
Excuse us.

595
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:09,160
- Excuse me, Death? - Oh, now what?

596
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,850
Could you take us to someone who could help us?

597
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:15,420
You have beaten me. I am at your command.

598
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,120
Cool!

599
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:18,550
This way.

600
00:51:20,430 --> 00:51:22,040
- Ted. - What?

601
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:24,140
Don't fear the Reaper.

602
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:27,690
I heard that.

603
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:42,640
This is most atypical.

604
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,930
Welcome to Heaven.

605
00:52:10,570 --> 00:52:12,770
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

606
00:52:14,030 --> 00:52:15,100
Thank you.

607
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:18,640
- Through there. - Thank you.

608
00:52:18,730 --> 00:52:20,040
Welcome to Heaven.

609
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:21,430
- Hello. - Hello.

610
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:23,530
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

611
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:29,210
"Only the most serene and enlightened souIs shall gain audience."

612
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:31,550
Dude, we're in big trouble.

613
00:52:34,230 --> 00:52:36,030
I think I have an idea, dude.

614
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:43,620
- Hello. - Welcome to heaven.

615
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,740
Wise dudes.

616
00:52:47,220 --> 00:52:49,490
- Can we ask you a question? - Okey.

617
00:52:49,830 --> 00:52:51,560
Right this way, please.

618
00:53:02,510 --> 00:53:05,440
Dude, we're in Heaven, and we just mugged three people.

619
00:53:05,450 --> 00:53:09,330
I know. We better get out of here before we ruin it for everybody.

620
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,070
Come on, Death.

621
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,090
You look great, dude.

622
00:53:18,650 --> 00:53:19,920
You think so?

623
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:26,360
Yeah. You do.

624
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:31,150
You shut up.

625
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,670
- Come on, dude. - It's not funny.

626
00:53:35,740 --> 00:53:38,440
Can't believe I'm doing this stupid.

627
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:41,590
How did I end up in this ridicular situation?

628
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,450
How's it going?

629
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,560
What is the meaning of life?

630
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,670
Every rose has its thorn

632
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:24,280
Just like every night has its dawn

633
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,570
Just like every cowboy

634
00:54:27,710 --> 00:54:32,030
Sings a sad, sad song

635
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,860
Every rose has a thorn

636
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,140
Don't I know you?

637
00:54:45,690 --> 00:54:46,810
No.

638
00:55:29,180 --> 00:55:32,570
So, God, as if you didn't know...

639
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:35,160
we're not the three wise people

641
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:36,930
that you might have thought we were.

642
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,460
No. We mugged three people

643
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:42,160
and took their clothes. Sorry.

644
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:44,750
I'm Bill S. Preston.

645
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:46,850
I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

646
00:55:46,850 --> 00:55:51,240
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

647
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,870
This lovely lady is the Grim Reaper.

648
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:58,610
He brought us here when we challenged him and won.

649
00:55:59,130 --> 00:56:01,130
Now, okey.

650
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:05,290
First of all, congratulations on Earth!

651
00:56:05,290 --> 00:56:07,040
It's a most excellent planet.

652
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,880
Bill and I enjoy it on a daily basis.

653
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:12,090
Not to mention your other great planets.

654
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,740
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus.

655
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:22,490
But the point is, we died.

656
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,440
Most unfairly.

657
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,730
But we won the chance to come back.

658
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:31,440
We need to construct something to help saving the women we love.

659
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:36,020
And we don't get a lot of time. So we were wondering...

660
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:38,280
...could you maybe help us find somebody

661
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:39,820
who can maybe help us bulild something?

662
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:42,980
Station.

663
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,180
We were thinking along the lines of ...

664
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:49,320
...maybe a scientist or something.

665
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:04,200
Cool.

666
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:09,160
Thanks, God.

667
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:13,630
Yeah. You're a just and noble creator.

668
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,790
- Okay. We'll be going now. - Keep up the good work.

669
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:20,620
Catch you later, God.

670
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,740
Sorry. They melvined me.

671
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:43,600
All right, upside-down cake!

672
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,950
- Evil Ted. - What?

673
00:57:52,120 --> 00:57:53,720
We're out of dishes.

674
00:57:55,370 --> 00:57:56,910
Check this out.

675
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:02,950
Not bad, E.T.

676
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:06,900
Let me try.

677
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:15,920
You totally didn't see the fan.

678
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,890
Tell my body to get over here and get me!

679
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:27,620
That's all right. I'll get you.

680
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:31,440
Got your head, dude.

681
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:36,960
I'm totally gonna tackle you, dude.

682
00:58:40,890 --> 00:58:42,830
Touchdown for Evil Ted!

683
00:58:42,830 --> 00:58:45,210
We're total headbangers.

684
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:52,100
Come on. There you go.

685
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:02,140
Stop wasting time. Proceed with the plan now.

686
00:59:02,140 --> 00:59:03,740
Okay, dude.

687
00:59:05,010 --> 00:59:08,110
What do you say we trash their relationships?

688
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:12,380
I hate them.

689
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:15,600
I hate the robot versions of them.

690
00:59:16,370 --> 00:59:18,140
You made us, dude.

691
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,980
Looks like this is the place, dude.

692
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:30,800
Now all we gotta do is find that scientist.

693
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:35,900
- What kind of name is Station? - I don't know.

694
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:37,850
Must be some kind of future guy.

695
00:59:43,910 --> 00:59:46,160
Okay, how many syllables?

696
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,270
Is it a play or a song or...?

697
00:59:52,210 --> 00:59:53,760
It's something big.

698
00:59:55,650 --> 00:59:57,880
My money's on Einstein.

699
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:02,080
That's Station?

700
01:00:03,030 --> 01:00:06,660
Did you assume the most brilliant scientist...

701
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:10,270
...in the entire universe would be from Earth?

702
01:00:11,470 --> 01:00:12,530
Yeah.

703
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,350
Movies?

704
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,020
- Nine words. - Good, Mr. Franklin.

705
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:25,450
Fire? Cigarettes?

706
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:28,210
- Clouds, clouds. - Smoke?

707
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:32,540
Butch and Sundance: The Early Years.

709
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:41,580
- Death! - Sorry.

710
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:47,760
Smokey and the Bandit III.

712
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,000
Smokey is the bandit!

713
01:01:00,820 --> 01:01:02,990
Excuse us. Martians?

714
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,430
First, my friend, Bill and I would like to congratulate you...

715
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,550
- ...on a most well-played round of charades. - Totally

716
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:11,990
Secondly,

717
01:01:11,990 --> 01:01:13,380
you've been referred to us...

718
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:17,020
...as the most brilliant scientists in the universe.

719
01:01:17,390 --> 01:01:20,100
So how would you like to come to earth

720
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:21,990
and help us build good robot usses...

721
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:25,530
...to save two beautiful princesses from bad robot usses?

722
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:36,300
Sounds good, Station.

723
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:39,970
Let's go.

724
01:01:41,420 --> 01:01:42,970
Let's rock, Death.

725
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:10,520
Ted.

726
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,150
- We're alive. - Yeah.

727
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,460
But I think a buzzard was pecking at my head.

728
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:26,870
Dinner's over, worm-dude.

729
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:32,260
You guys okay?

730
01:02:34,130 --> 01:02:35,510
Where's Death?

731
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:46,950
You okay, dude?

732
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:51,960
I'm fine.

733
01:02:59,390 --> 01:03:02,890
First thing on the agenda, we go back to town and we clean up.

734
01:03:02,890 --> 01:03:05,310
Second, we find the princesses and warn them.

735
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:08,630
Third, we purchase stuff to build good robot usses.

736
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,260
Okay. Let's go.

737
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:17,730
What? What?

738
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:36,200
Here, kitty, kitty! Here, kitty, kitty!

739
01:03:36,930 --> 01:03:37,790
There's one, dude!

740
01:03:40,390 --> 01:03:41,620
Just missed, dude.

741
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:44,920
Dude, we're there.

742
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,460
Okay. I got an idea.

743
01:04:09,170 --> 01:04:11,360
How's it going, lady humans?

745
01:04:39,820 --> 01:04:43,020
Okay, Stations, this is Builders Emporium...

746
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:46,980
...a repository for electronics and robot materiaIs.

747
01:04:47,290 --> 01:04:49,980
Get what you need to make metal usses.

748
01:04:54,670 --> 01:04:58,030
- Ready for the big night, babies? - No! We're not going.

749
01:05:01,470 --> 01:05:03,710
I think you guys should stop right there.

750
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:07,540
Catch you later, future wife.

751
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:11,590
Evil breath!

752
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,340
Who are you two?

753
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,470
Well, you see...

754
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,350
Oh my god!

755
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:28,440
Come on.

756
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:34,700
- Any luck? - No, they're not at our place or theirs.

757
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:38,320
I'll try your dad's place. Maybe they went to talk to Missy.

758
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:50,180
Hello, Logan residence.

759
01:05:50,180 --> 01:05:52,760
Evil Bill S. Preston, Esquire, speaking.

760
01:05:55,940 --> 01:05:58,300
It's them! They're back from the dead.

761
01:05:59,650 --> 01:06:01,010
I guess we get to kill them again.

762
01:06:02,030 --> 01:06:03,390
Excellent!

766
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:20,780
See you real soon.

767
01:06:25,390 --> 01:06:28,750
- But this time we're ready for you! - Yeah!

768
01:06:32,390 --> 01:06:34,260
I think we can be ready for them too.

769
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,300
Good luck getting in the concert, losers!

770
01:06:44,530 --> 01:06:47,980
- Initiate the final plan now. - You got it, great one.

771
01:06:50,030 --> 01:06:51,690
Do not fail me.

772
01:06:53,330 --> 01:06:55,070
Metallic buffoons.

773
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:03,830
- That other me is a dick. - Yeah.

774
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:08,250
I hope the Stations know what they're doing.

775
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:31,100
Station! What are you doing?

776
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:37,490
Dudes! This is no time to be playing games!

777
01:08:12,950 --> 01:08:15,150
Station.

778
01:08:15,910 --> 01:08:17,440
Station.

780
01:09:57,470 --> 01:09:58,670
That one's me, right?

781
01:09:59,060 --> 01:10:00,730
Station.

782
01:10:02,770 --> 01:10:03,840
Not bad.

783
01:10:04,810 --> 01:10:06,510
How's it going, Good Robot Bill?

784
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:09,600
How's it doing?

785
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,830
Kate Axelrod for KJM channel 12...

786
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:28,080
... reporting live from the San Dimas Civic Auditorium.

787
01:10:28,090 --> 01:10:31,620
We're rocking at the 4th annual of the Battle of the Bands.

788
01:10:31,710 --> 01:10:35,090
So stay tuned and hold tight until we find out...

789
01:10:35,090 --> 01:10:38,000
... who will be your winner.

791
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:49,800
You guys ready? You're up.

792
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:50,970
Where are the girIs?

793
01:10:51,730 --> 01:10:55,100
They're hanging from the rafters. We're gonna kill them at the finale.

794
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,270
Good luck, gentlemen.

795
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:06,400
Check it out.

796
01:11:09,220 --> 01:11:10,610
Not bad.

797
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,060
Let's hear it for Primus!

799
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:17,830
Station, are they ready?

800
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:19,330
Station.

801
01:12:20,030 --> 01:12:21,480
Excellent work, dude.

802
01:12:21,990 --> 01:12:26,040
- What about me? I made the wigs. - Okay, Death.

803
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:29,320
I helped do the shopping. I was pushing the cart.

804
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:33,360
- These work like we asked? - Station.

805
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,740
You're a most excellent scientist, Station.

806
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:43,170
Plus, you got an excellently huge Martian butt.

807
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,670
Station.

808
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,050
Feel free to split in two parts again and relax.

809
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:57,350
Don't overlook my butt. I work out all the time.

810
01:12:57,610 --> 01:12:59,720
And reaping burns a lot of calories.

811
01:13:04,160 --> 01:13:09,230
Ready to take on those evil usses and save the babes?

812
01:13:12,040 --> 01:13:15,450
Fight evil usses. Save the babes.

813
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:18,120
- Ready, Bill? - Ready, Ted.

814
01:13:20,220 --> 01:13:21,450
Let's go get 'em.

815
01:13:22,430 --> 01:13:25,080
And now, the last band of the evening.

816
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,880
Wyld Stallyns!

817
01:13:38,730 --> 01:13:40,390
How's it going, worms?

818
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:44,600
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

819
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:46,940
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan!

820
01:13:47,330 --> 01:13:51,730
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

821
01:13:53,750 --> 01:13:54,820
Hold it right there!

822
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:01,080
We're Wyld Stallyns!

823
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:04,660
No, dudes. We're Wyld Stallyns!

824
01:14:07,930 --> 01:14:11,590
You totally killed us, you evil metal dickweeds!

825
01:14:12,060 --> 01:14:14,550
Yeah, and we're gonna do it again!

826
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:18,090
Plus, we're gonna totally kill your girIfriends.

827
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,560
Don't worry, babes! We'll save you.

828
01:14:33,120 --> 01:14:36,740
Everybody, say hello to Station's creation!

829
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:39,200
Good Robot Bill and Ted!

830
01:14:52,470 --> 01:14:54,670
Dude, we may have met our match.

831
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,220
Kudos to you, good human usses.

832
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:04,520
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted! - Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

833
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:42,930
- Elizabeth! - Theodore!

834
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,350
- Joanna! - William!

835
01:16:00,750 --> 01:16:01,700
Who is that?

836
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:20,340
Who are you?

837
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,550
Who am I?

838
01:16:30,450 --> 01:16:32,310
I am De Nomolos.

839
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:36,020
I am their master.

840
01:16:37,710 --> 01:16:40,530
And I must see to it that you die.

841
01:16:43,790 --> 01:16:44,870
But first...

842
01:17:10,950 --> 01:17:15,520
We are now transmitting on every channel throughout the world.

843
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,940
My word!

844
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,240
I want the whole universe to behold this...

845
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:28,120
... transfer of power.

846
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:33,370
No longer will our future society...

847
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,920
... be based on the ideas and the music...

848
01:17:37,140 --> 01:17:38,880
... of these two fooIs!

849
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,550
They will be based on my ideas...

850
01:17:46,980 --> 01:17:49,390
...and my ideas alone!

851
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,890
Dude, how do we get out of this? We don't got any time.

852
01:17:53,910 --> 01:17:56,870
Yeah, we do, dude. Look, after we get away from this guy...

853
01:17:56,870 --> 01:18:00,110
...we use the booth, we time-travel back to before the concert

854
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,150
and set up the things we need to get him now.

855
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:04,360
Yeah, like what?

856
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:07,410
Like a sandbag.

857
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:14,750
Excellent!

858
01:18:15,390 --> 01:18:16,500
Then we'll get a cage.

859
01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,170
My friends.

860
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,550
I too can play the time game.

861
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:33,010
If you do that, once I have vanquished you...

862
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,810
...I'll go back and set up this key.

863
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,950
And another gun.

865
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:03,680
Right, dude. Only there's one thing you didn't think of.

866
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,270
Yeah, only the winners' gonna go back and set things up.

867
01:19:07,270 --> 01:19:09,720
Yeah, and that's gonna be us, dude.

868
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:13,220
We set up the key, and we set up the gun.

869
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:17,890
Excuse me.

870
01:19:18,780 --> 01:19:20,900
Your shoelaces are untied.

871
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,030
Melvined.

872
01:19:43,970 --> 01:19:45,000
You're under arrest, pal.

873
01:19:45,810 --> 01:19:46,880
Way to go, Dad!

874
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,600
Book him, Danno.

875
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:02,310
Good job, Death.

876
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,240
Who was that guy?

877
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:12,990
Perhaps I can answer that question, gentlemen.

878
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,630
Ms. Wardroe, thanks for the help.

879
01:20:15,630 --> 01:20:17,870
You know, we definitely...

880
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:20,910
Yeah, take it off, baby!

881
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,220
Rufus!

882
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,930
How long you been here, dude?

883
01:20:33,190 --> 01:20:35,350
Just in time for your audition.

884
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:38,600
So you were Ms. Wardroe all along.

885
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:42,690
Hey, would anyone eIse have let you in this contest?

886
01:20:43,740 --> 01:20:46,690
- No! - Now amigos,

887
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:50,110
That was Chuck De Nomolos, my old gym teacher.

888
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:54,410
And, by the way, sit-up champion of the 27th century.

889
01:20:55,170 --> 01:20:59,490
And now, gentlemen, I believe the stage belongs to you.

890
01:20:59,550 --> 01:21:00,580
Thanks, Rufus.

891
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:16,430
Dude, we stilI don't know how to play.

892
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,140
Maybe we ought to get good, Ted.

893
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:20,470
How?

894
01:21:43,340 --> 01:21:47,000
That was a fast 16 months of intensive guitar training, dude.

895
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:51,250
Yeah, except for the two-week medieval honeymoon.

896
01:21:53,810 --> 01:21:57,430
Hello, San Dimas!

897
01:21:57,650 --> 01:21:59,640
Let me introduce you to a little friend.

898
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,470
This is little Ted.

899
01:22:02,490 --> 01:22:04,520
Hello, little Ted!

900
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:06,480
This is little Bill.

901
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,940
Hello, little Bill!

902
01:22:10,620 --> 01:22:14,610
Now for the rest of our band, Ted.

903
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,840
On conga and bongos, proof that

904
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,790
you can't tell a book by its cover...

905
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:24,790
...the dude who can make one word mean anything...

906
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:26,580
...Station!

907
01:22:31,930 --> 01:22:33,510
Our backup dancers...

908
01:22:33,770 --> 01:22:36,380
...Station's most bodacious creations...

909
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,680
...the Good Robot Usses!

910
01:22:45,910 --> 01:22:46,990
And over here...

911
01:22:46,990 --> 01:22:50,230
...our bass player, the Duke of Spooks...

912
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:53,040
...the Doc of Shocks, the Man With No Tan...

913
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,990
...please say hello to Death himseIf...

914
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,570
...the Grim Reaper!

915
01:23:06,090 --> 01:23:08,590
You might be a king or a little street sweeper

916
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,380
But sooner or later you dance with the Reaper

917
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:19,260
Get down with your bad seIf!

918
01:23:26,410 --> 01:23:28,350
I love show business.

919
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:31,270
Ladies and gentlemen...

920
01:23:32,620 --> 01:23:34,070
...we've been to the past.

921
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:36,230
We've been to the future.

922
01:23:37,250 --> 01:23:39,150
We've been all around the afterlife.

923
01:23:40,210 --> 01:23:41,200
And you know...

924
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:45,240
The best place to be...

925
01:23:48,640 --> 01:23:49,540
...is here.

926
01:23:51,140 --> 01:23:52,420
And the best time to be...

927
01:23:53,560 --> 01:23:54,500
...is now.

928
01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:02,970
And all we can say is...

929
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:07,220
...let's rock!

930
01:24:07,990 --> 01:24:09,680
One! Two!

931
01:24:09,740 --> 01:24:12,020
One, two, three, four!

932
01:25:36,740 --> 01:25:39,570
Right good! Right good!
