1
00:00:38,415 --> 00:00:40,292
It is time.

2
00:00:42,086 --> 00:00:48,092
They've reached the second crucial
turning point in their destiny.

3
00:00:48,259 --> 00:00:52,805
Their message is about to
reach millions.

4
00:00:53,013 --> 00:00:56,725
But... we will change all that.

5
00:00:58,394 --> 00:01:01,480
When our mission is successful...

6
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:05,818
...no longer will the world
be dominated...

7
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:11,282
...by the legacy of these two fools!

8
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,743
No longer will we hear this:

9
00:01:15,411 --> 00:01:17,413
We will stop them now!

10
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:20,583
Brothers and sisters...

11
00:01:21,834 --> 00:01:24,003
...are we ready?

12
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:58,973
- Greetings, my excellent pupils.
- Station.

13
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:03,435
Let's continue our study of the
physics of acoustical reverberation.

14
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:07,147
Meet today's most non-bogus
guest speakers.

15
00:03:07,314 --> 00:03:09,358
Say hello to Thomas Edison.

16
00:03:10,276 --> 00:03:11,277
Hello there.

17
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,654
To help us on the musical side:

18
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:15,739
Johann Sebastian Bach.

19
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:22,037
And Sir James Martin
of Faith No More...

20
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:27,334
...founder of the Faith No More
Spiritual and Theological Center.

21
00:03:28,586 --> 00:03:32,923
- Station!
- Station!

22
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:36,051
And a special treat
from the 23rd century:

23
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:38,012
Miss Ria Paschelle.

24
00:03:42,808 --> 00:03:45,269
Miss Paschelle is
the inventor of the...

25
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:49,106
...statiophonicoxygeneticamp-
lifiagraphiphonideliverberator.

26
00:03:49,315 --> 00:03:52,234
Hard to imagine the world
without them, isn't it?

27
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:57,698
Remember, this Friday, Ben Franklin
and Aretha Franklin will be here.

28
00:03:57,907 --> 00:04:02,912
Saturday is the field trip
to Babylonia. And very important:

29
00:04:03,162 --> 00:04:08,501
Do not do your homework without
wearing headphones...

30
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,686
De Nomolos. My old teacher.

31
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:13,774
Rufus.
My favorite pupil.

32
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:16,527
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

33
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:18,654
No.

34
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:21,448
Just in preparation.

35
00:05:23,742 --> 00:05:28,455
I worked within the system
until I could stand it no longer.

36
00:05:28,664 --> 00:05:30,457
And soon...

37
00:05:30,708 --> 00:05:36,714
...soon the system
will never have existed.

38
00:05:37,715 --> 00:05:40,551
- You won't get away with it.
- Time will tell.

39
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:42,303
Time has told.

40
00:05:42,553 --> 00:05:48,309
I'll go back and change that,
with the aid of my secret weapons!

41
00:05:52,897 --> 00:05:55,149
How's it going, dudes?

42
00:06:14,376 --> 00:06:18,631
Friends, friends, friends.
These are automatons.

43
00:06:18,923 --> 00:06:23,052
Replicas only.
Furnished with my agenda.

44
00:06:23,802 --> 00:06:26,013
Now, what is your mission?

45
00:06:26,263 --> 00:06:31,310
- First, we totally kill Bill and Ted.
- Then we take over their lives.

46
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:33,854
Then we utterly destroy them.

47
00:06:34,021 --> 00:06:38,984
At the Battle of the Bands, we give
their speech except totally different.

48
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:43,155
And thus a new future is born.
A great future.

49
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:45,783
Don't tell us.
You programmed us.

50
00:06:45,991 --> 00:06:48,744
- He's totally a robot!
- So are you!

51
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,829
We're total metal heads!

52
00:06:52,081 --> 00:06:53,541
Shut up.

53
00:06:57,253 --> 00:06:58,671
Now.

54
00:06:59,588 --> 00:07:01,966
- What is the fuel?
- Fear!

55
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:04,844
- What is the engine?
- Discipline!

56
00:07:05,052 --> 00:07:07,346
- What is the ideal?
- Order!

57
00:07:07,555 --> 00:07:09,640
And how do we achieve it?

58
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:20,526
Death to Bill and Ted!

59
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:26,574
Catch you later, evil dude.

60
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,577
I am Bill S. Preston...

61
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:13,495
...Esquire!

62
00:08:15,915 --> 00:08:19,835
This is Ted "Theodore" Logan!

63
00:08:22,421 --> 00:08:24,715
On drums and keyboards...

64
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:28,511
...celebrating their fifth year
in the 20th century...

65
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:31,805
...the princesses
from medieval England.

66
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:34,725
Joanna and Elizabeth.

67
00:08:36,101 --> 00:08:37,394
And we are...

68
00:08:38,437 --> 00:08:40,856
...Wyld Stallyns.

69
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:48,781
You tell me you're
the greatest band, but you stink.

70
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:52,868
We don't understand it either.

71
00:08:53,077 --> 00:08:54,662
You can't sing.

72
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,583
- The girls can play. But you guys?
- Girls mature faster than guys.

73
00:08:59,792 --> 00:09:02,294
Plus, they started
in the 15th century.

74
00:09:02,586 --> 00:09:03,796
What do you mean?

75
00:09:04,004 --> 00:09:07,299
- They're from medieval England.
- Ted, shut up.

76
00:09:07,758 --> 00:09:09,635
Medieval England, Iowa.

77
00:09:09,844 --> 00:09:14,223
The Battle of the Bands is
the biggest event in the area.

78
00:09:14,431 --> 00:09:17,226
We're talking
about a $25,000 first prize...

79
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:21,856
...a two-year record deal and exposure
to people in the business.

80
00:09:22,106 --> 00:09:27,903
We're even live on Channel 12. If you
were me, would you put you guys on?

81
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:29,280
No way.

82
00:09:30,614 --> 00:09:34,368
Since you work for Pretzels 'N' Cheese,
I'll give you a shot.

83
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,245
Excellent!

84
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:43,627
But last. Midnight.
By that time, everyone will be gone.

85
00:09:43,836 --> 00:09:46,380
That's all right.
We're used to that.

86
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,009
We cleaned out Ted's brother's
junior high dance.

87
00:09:50,217 --> 00:09:53,679
They turned on "La Bamba"
while he was playing his solo.

88
00:09:53,888 --> 00:09:55,681
Shut up, Ted!

89
00:09:55,931 --> 00:09:59,977
Guys, do yourself a favor.
Prepare a little.

90
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:03,189
Work on your act.
Think of something.

91
00:10:03,397 --> 00:10:06,775
Don't worry.
We won't let you down.

92
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:15,492
- Dude, we gotta win.
- Then we could propose to the ladies.

93
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,372
We can't raise a family on the
money from Pretzels 'N' Cheese.

94
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:24,710
I'll tell Missy we're on our way.

95
00:10:24,877 --> 00:10:28,255
Should be a most resplendent
birthday party.

96
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:32,885
- Shall we, ladies?
- Great, sure.

97
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:56,867
So you have something
else to celebrate tonight.

98
00:10:57,409 --> 00:10:59,954
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

99
00:11:02,331 --> 00:11:05,668
If we win, I'll totally
pay you back your money.

100
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,920
What if you don't win?

101
00:11:09,964 --> 00:11:14,260
Well, uh, I guess...

102
00:11:17,555 --> 00:11:22,142
- Maybe sell more blood.
- Think about selling the instruments.

103
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:26,230
Of course, we've always got
a spot for you.

104
00:11:26,689 --> 00:11:31,026
Remember my friend, Colonel Oats
from the Alaskan Military School?

105
00:11:36,323 --> 00:11:37,950
- "How's it going?"
- Yeah.

106
00:11:38,158 --> 00:11:40,035
Splendidly.

107
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,705
Remember...

108
00:11:42,913 --> 00:11:45,499
...it's not too late for you, Ted.

109
00:11:52,047 --> 00:11:53,549
For either of you.

110
00:11:54,675 --> 00:11:56,719
For all four of you.

111
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:06,562
Fresh fudge.

112
00:12:07,813 --> 00:12:09,231
Hi, Oatsie.

113
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:12,401
Darling.

114
00:12:14,111 --> 00:12:15,863
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Missy.

115
00:12:16,071 --> 00:12:18,824
Hey, Missy.
I mean, Mom.

116
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,208
I can't believe Missy
divorced your dad...

117
00:12:27,416 --> 00:12:29,043
...and married mine.

118
00:12:30,044 --> 00:12:31,587
Shut up, Ted.

119
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:40,095
- Your dad looks bad.
- I know.

120
00:12:42,014 --> 00:12:43,224
What's next?

121
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:48,312
- Maybe she'll marry you.
- Then you'll be your own stepdad.

122
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:57,696
You probably noticed we haven't
given you our gifts yet.

123
00:12:57,905 --> 00:12:59,615
That's because...

124
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:08,290
That's because we wanted to say...

125
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:17,967
Excuse us, dude.

126
00:13:27,601 --> 00:13:29,228
I wrote this myself.

127
00:13:29,436 --> 00:13:31,522
I wrote this last night.

128
00:13:36,694 --> 00:13:37,695
"Elizabeth..."

129
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:38,904
"Joanna...

130
00:13:40,656 --> 00:13:44,118
...as I wander through this dark
and Ionely forest of life..."

131
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:46,662
"...surrounded by various beasts..."

132
00:13:46,871 --> 00:13:49,957
"...bears, vipers, squirrels..."

133
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,668
"Not to mention barnacles
and algae..."

134
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:56,964
"...man-of-wars, starfish,
blowfish, catfish..."

135
00:13:57,506 --> 00:13:59,341
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

136
00:14:00,342 --> 00:14:04,555
The point is, I know we promised you
a better life than this.

137
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:10,853
What I mean to say is, I realize
when we took you out of England...

138
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,481
...we said the future held
some really good stuff.

139
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:17,860
Although stuff hasn't
worked out how we thought...

140
00:14:18,527 --> 00:14:21,488
...it will, we hope.

141
00:14:23,032 --> 00:14:25,576
The day after tomorrow,
if things work out...

142
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:28,370
What this is about is...

143
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:38,088
- Will you...?
- Marry us?

144
00:14:45,054 --> 00:14:46,847
- Theodore...
- I'd love to.

145
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:32,977
- Aim for the cat, dude!
- I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

146
00:15:37,773 --> 00:15:39,525
Aw, just missed!

147
00:15:49,702 --> 00:15:53,956
- Not bad.
- Yeah, let's make it bad.

148
00:16:05,134 --> 00:16:06,594
We're here, dude.

149
00:16:07,636 --> 00:16:08,929
Is Rufus with you?

150
00:16:10,264 --> 00:16:11,307
One second.

151
00:16:22,943 --> 00:16:26,906
Looks like we lost him in the
circuits of time, duder.

152
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:30,451
Good.
Then he's gone forever.

153
00:16:30,618 --> 00:16:34,038
Our first act of business:

154
00:16:34,246 --> 00:16:37,458
Destroy that ridiculous,
insipid band!

155
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,960
You got it, dude!

156
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:42,129
Get to work.

157
00:16:44,131 --> 00:16:45,090
Now!

158
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,009
Study these books well.

159
00:16:47,176 --> 00:16:49,803
When my mission is completed...

160
00:16:50,012 --> 00:16:52,765
...this will be the new history.

161
00:16:54,225 --> 00:16:55,726
What a shithead.

162
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:02,775
- Bye!
- Bye!

163
00:17:03,943 --> 00:17:05,444
Drive safe!

164
00:17:06,946 --> 00:17:07,947
- Dude.
- What?

165
00:17:08,155 --> 00:17:11,617
After we're married,
will the girls stay with us?

166
00:17:11,825 --> 00:17:14,745
Yeah, our girlfriends are
most chaste.

167
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:18,958
- At least they're not dating our dads.
- Good point, dude.

168
00:17:24,255 --> 00:17:26,841
- Hello?
- This is Joanna.

169
00:17:27,049 --> 00:17:30,094
Joanna! How'd you call so fast?

170
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:32,388
It's not important. This is:

171
00:17:32,638 --> 00:17:36,892
Elizabeth and I have decided
we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

172
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,060
What?

173
00:17:38,269 --> 00:17:39,436
- Yes!
- Why?

174
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:42,606
You're losers and
we don't want to see you again.

175
00:17:42,773 --> 00:17:43,774
No way!

176
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:49,947
We're going to the desert to be alone.
It's over. Goodbye.

177
00:17:56,954 --> 00:18:01,667
- I totally fooled them.
- Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

178
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:02,918
Not!

179
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:06,964
- Let's start phase two.
- Station.

180
00:18:35,117 --> 00:18:37,828
<i>An incredible fortune in stones.</i>

181
00:18:39,413 --> 00:18:42,416
<i>Yet I'd trade them all
for a hand phaser.</i>

182
00:18:43,792 --> 00:18:46,003
<i>Or a good solid club.</i>

183
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:50,424
Maybe we should've proposed
to them sooner.

184
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:54,386
How could we, Ted?

185
00:18:54,595 --> 00:18:57,097
We could barely afford
our own apartment.

186
00:18:57,806 --> 00:19:01,644
This is most non-non-heinous.

187
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:05,356
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta find them.

188
00:19:05,606 --> 00:19:06,815
Talk to them.

189
00:19:07,775 --> 00:19:08,734
But how?

190
00:19:28,295 --> 00:19:30,506
Who could that be?

191
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,099
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

192
00:19:40,474 --> 00:19:42,893
Ted, it's us again.

193
00:19:43,686 --> 00:19:46,814
- How's it going, Bill?
- Not bad, Bill. And you?

194
00:19:46,939 --> 00:19:47,982
Bad.

195
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:54,071
We came to help in your most
unfortunate situation.

196
00:20:02,037 --> 00:20:03,080
How?

197
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:05,374
Come with us. We'll show you.

198
00:20:07,585 --> 00:20:08,961
Excuse us.

199
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:15,718
- I got a weird feeling here.
- Why?

200
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,553
I don't know.

201
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:21,432
How do we know they're really us?

202
00:20:25,853 --> 00:20:27,813
We've been through this before.

203
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:30,816
Without the intervention
of our future selves...

204
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:34,904
...would we have passed history?
Or met the babes?

205
00:20:35,487 --> 00:20:38,991
Or had a most excellent adventure
through time?

206
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:48,000
Ted, if you're really me,
how many fingers am I gonna hold up?

207
00:20:48,209 --> 00:20:49,210
Three.

208
00:20:51,712 --> 00:20:53,464
You're right!

209
00:20:55,174 --> 00:20:57,176
Let's go, guys.
We'll drive.

210
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:04,683
- Ted.
- What?

211
00:21:04,934 --> 00:21:09,688
I think we're about to embark
on an unprecedented expedition.

212
00:21:11,774 --> 00:21:13,275
- Dude.
- What?

213
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:17,613
I got a full-on robot chubby.

214
00:21:18,572 --> 00:21:19,990
Later, Evil Ted.

215
00:21:20,491 --> 00:21:21,742
Later.

216
00:21:36,423 --> 00:21:37,716
I'm cold.

217
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:42,930
Hey! Can we have some heat back here?

218
00:21:43,138 --> 00:21:44,640
Shut up, Bill.

219
00:21:46,976 --> 00:21:49,186
That other you's a real jerk.

220
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:55,192
I'll be more considerate to myself
when I become him.

221
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,486
He said, shut your holes!

222
00:22:00,406 --> 00:22:02,491
I got a very bad feeling.

223
00:22:36,567 --> 00:22:37,693
Out.

224
00:22:45,201 --> 00:22:48,704
So where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

225
00:22:49,121 --> 00:22:50,664
They're not here.

226
00:22:50,831 --> 00:22:55,085
We lied. Here's the truth,
we're gonna kill you now.

227
00:22:56,295 --> 00:22:58,214
- No way!
- Yes way, Ted.

228
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:02,968
- We're programmed to do it.
- And we want to do it too.

229
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,638
You dick, Bill!

230
00:23:09,934 --> 00:23:13,896
- You're metal, dude!
- I know. Check it out.

231
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:25,199
Let's go.

232
00:23:25,908 --> 00:23:27,409
Bogus.

233
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,114
We gotta do something.

234
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:09,285
Dudes, even though
you're doing this...

235
00:24:09,493 --> 00:24:12,872
...we, we...

236
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,623
We love you.

237
00:24:14,874 --> 00:24:16,584
We love you.

238
00:24:18,836 --> 00:24:20,254
Fags!

239
00:24:25,384 --> 00:24:28,596
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

240
00:24:46,155 --> 00:24:50,201
Yes! I totally loogied on that
good dead me!

241
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:55,289
- We're fully, full-on evil robots.
- Yeah!

242
00:25:00,294 --> 00:25:03,005
- You wanna take the van?
- No, it's beat.

243
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:06,884
There's a Porsche.

244
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:09,970
Let's bag it.

245
00:25:11,805 --> 00:25:13,307
Station.

246
00:25:51,846 --> 00:25:52,847
Bill...

247
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,766
...what happened?

248
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:58,394
Ted...

249
00:25:59,728 --> 00:26:01,730
...we're dead, dude.

250
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:08,737
- No way.
- Yes way.

251
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:10,364
Look.

252
00:26:17,037 --> 00:26:18,789
Now what?

253
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,044
Who's that?

254
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,265
Who are you?

255
00:26:36,932 --> 00:26:37,975
Ted...

256
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,687
...it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

257
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,275
How's it hanging, Death?

258
00:26:47,234 --> 00:26:49,904
You will come with me.

259
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:56,118
We can't.
We gotta get back to the babes.

260
00:26:56,327 --> 00:26:58,787
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

261
00:26:58,996 --> 00:27:02,583
We gotta stop these evil "usses."
We gotta try.

262
00:27:04,543 --> 00:27:07,755
Excuse us, dude,
but is there any way back?

263
00:27:10,174 --> 00:27:13,177
You may challenge me to a contest.

264
00:27:13,719 --> 00:27:15,387
But if you lose...

265
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:19,141
...you will remain here
in the afterlife...

266
00:27:19,642 --> 00:27:21,101
...forever.

267
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,900
What if we win?

268
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:32,655
No one has ever won.

269
00:27:33,906 --> 00:27:37,409
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy.
- Definitely.

270
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:39,078
But how?

271
00:27:41,789 --> 00:27:44,291
Melvin.

272
00:27:47,628 --> 00:27:50,130
Excuse us, dude...

273
00:27:50,297 --> 00:27:52,967
...but your shoes are untied.

274
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:06,647
I can't believe
we just melvined Death.

275
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:11,944
Let's hope he doesn't
catch up with us.

276
00:28:53,194 --> 00:28:54,653
No way!

277
00:28:58,157 --> 00:28:59,241
This isn't funny.

278
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,951
Way to go, Joanna!

279
00:29:01,202 --> 00:29:03,871
I don't understand
what's come over you two.

280
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:08,000
You see, we used to be puss-weeds,
but now we're metal.

281
00:29:08,209 --> 00:29:10,586
So get over here and put out!

282
00:29:12,213 --> 00:29:15,382
You can forget
about us playing tonight.

283
00:29:16,258 --> 00:29:17,259
Fine.

284
00:29:23,015 --> 00:29:25,267
Then I guess that's that.

285
00:29:27,394 --> 00:29:29,480
Yeah, see you.

286
00:29:42,076 --> 00:29:44,161
Catch you later, babes!

287
00:29:53,671 --> 00:29:55,881
Ted, I have an idea.

288
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:58,968
Tonight after we make
De Nomolos' speech...

289
00:29:59,718 --> 00:30:01,720
...let's waste them.

290
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:06,725
Station. Meanwhile, let's trash
this lame rathole.

291
00:30:06,934 --> 00:30:08,394
Stellar, Evil Ted!

292
00:30:14,984 --> 00:30:19,572
- Ted, we have got to stop them.
- Yeah. But how?

293
00:30:23,951 --> 00:30:25,327
I hope this works.

294
00:30:25,494 --> 00:30:28,956
<i>It worked in The Exorcist.
I and III!</i>

295
00:30:34,086 --> 00:30:39,258
You'll move downtown so DeLoach
can take her maternity leave.

296
00:30:39,466 --> 00:30:42,720
Also, anyone interested
in moonlighting...

297
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:46,390
...we're stepping up security
for the Battle of the Bands.

298
00:30:46,599 --> 00:30:49,894
I hear your son's band is playing.

299
00:30:52,438 --> 00:30:56,692
Thanks for reminding me, sergeant.
Also, Scott Frank...

300
00:30:57,026 --> 00:31:01,405
- So, how do we do this?
- I don't know.

301
00:31:02,823 --> 00:31:04,867
Why don't you try something?

302
00:31:06,076 --> 00:31:07,203
Okay.

303
00:31:24,803 --> 00:31:26,889
Okay, dudes.

304
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,934
I mean, fellow policemen...

305
00:31:30,476 --> 00:31:33,145
...my son, Ted "Theodore" Logan...

306
00:31:33,354 --> 00:31:35,940
...and his friend
Bill Preston, Esquire...

307
00:31:36,148 --> 00:31:40,611
...have been murdered and replaced
by evil robots from the future.

308
00:31:40,778 --> 00:31:42,530
You totally did it, dude!

309
00:31:42,696 --> 00:31:44,657
I totally possessed my dad.

310
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:50,955
Okay.

311
00:31:51,705 --> 00:31:56,752
You have to arrest these robots
so they don't ruin everything for us.

312
00:31:57,002 --> 00:31:59,547
I mean, my son and Bill.

313
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:04,426
And, most importantly,
they don't hurt the babes.

314
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:07,054
The princesses.

315
00:32:09,515 --> 00:32:10,641
This isn't working.

316
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:13,477
- Back me up, dude.
- You got it, dude.

317
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:28,284
I totally believe you, dude.

318
00:32:30,828 --> 00:32:34,248
- Doughnuts!
- Excellent!

319
00:32:34,415 --> 00:32:36,083
Savory cruller.

320
00:32:36,709 --> 00:32:40,212
- I got really hungry being dead.
- Yeah!

321
00:32:42,214 --> 00:32:44,675
I don't think they believe us.

322
00:32:45,634 --> 00:32:48,554
We have to find someone who will.

323
00:32:49,388 --> 00:32:52,057
Catch you later, cop dudes!

324
00:32:58,189 --> 00:33:01,400
Ted, we can't go like this.

325
00:33:13,037 --> 00:33:15,039
Thanks, Dad.

326
00:33:17,041 --> 00:33:20,794
- Good morning.
- Sergeant.

327
00:33:26,133 --> 00:33:27,343
Gandhi.

328
00:33:29,178 --> 00:33:30,971
Anne Boleyn.

329
00:33:31,972 --> 00:33:33,516
Aristotle.

330
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:37,061
President Chester A. Arthur.

331
00:33:38,521 --> 00:33:40,356
Clark Gable.

332
00:33:41,065 --> 00:33:42,650
Charlemagne.

333
00:33:43,150 --> 00:33:46,070
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

334
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:55,412
- Has this séance stuff ever worked?
- No.

335
00:33:56,956 --> 00:33:59,250
But it will today, dude.

336
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:09,927
O great spirits
from the netherworld...

337
00:34:10,094 --> 00:34:14,056
...leave your celestial
abode and speak upon us...

338
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:17,476
...with your life lessons.

339
00:34:28,154 --> 00:34:30,489
I feel the spirits have arrived!

340
00:34:30,656 --> 00:34:32,575
How's it going...

341
00:34:32,783 --> 00:34:35,661
...New Age dudes?

342
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:39,373
Spirits, can you hear me?

343
00:34:42,459 --> 00:34:44,753
And we can see down your...

344
00:34:44,962 --> 00:34:47,798
It's your mom, dude!

345
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:52,803
You're right! Move over, dude.

346
00:34:54,054 --> 00:34:57,266
Spirits, what have you to say to us?

347
00:34:58,434 --> 00:35:02,146
The princesses are in trouble.

348
00:35:03,147 --> 00:35:06,775
Ted and his most
excellent friend Bill...

349
00:35:06,984 --> 00:35:08,736
...were killed!

350
00:35:10,237 --> 00:35:13,866
- Listen to us.
- Beware!

351
00:35:18,454 --> 00:35:20,789
O evil spirits from Hell...

352
00:35:20,998 --> 00:35:24,168
...I send you back into the darkness!

353
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:31,967
- What's she doing?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

354
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:37,097
No way!

355
00:36:33,654 --> 00:36:36,448
This is a totally deep hole.

356
00:36:39,702 --> 00:36:42,872
- Now what?
- I don't know.

357
00:36:56,677 --> 00:37:01,182
- You wanna play 20 Questions?
- Okay. I got one.

358
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,184
Are you a mineral?

359
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:07,646
Are you a tank?

360
00:37:09,023 --> 00:37:10,316
Good one!

361
00:37:14,361 --> 00:37:17,531
- Not bad!
- Can we do it again?

362
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:22,953
I'm working as hard as I can!

363
00:37:23,204 --> 00:37:25,164
No way!

364
00:37:29,168 --> 00:37:33,130
This is not what I expected
this place to look like.

365
00:37:33,422 --> 00:37:37,218
We got totally lied to
by our album covers, man.

366
00:37:49,939 --> 00:37:51,524
Who's that?

367
00:37:51,899 --> 00:37:55,277
Ted, who do you think it is, dude?

368
00:38:00,032 --> 00:38:02,117
How do we get his attention?

369
00:38:03,035 --> 00:38:04,787
Sign of the devil, dude!

370
00:38:05,371 --> 00:38:09,250
- Hey, Devil dude!
- Down here!

371
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:11,669
Down here, dude!

372
00:38:11,877 --> 00:38:14,713
Two little guys!

373
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,966
Big dude! Down here!

374
00:38:29,687 --> 00:38:31,564
I kind of like this.

375
00:38:33,607 --> 00:38:35,317
Excellent!

376
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:39,238
Let's get out of here.

377
00:38:45,077 --> 00:38:49,373
Ted, if I die, you can have
my Megadeth collection.

378
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,001
But, dude, we're already dead!

379
00:38:53,294 --> 00:38:57,381
- Well, then they're yours, dude.
- Whoa! Thanks, dude.

380
00:39:18,152 --> 00:39:20,321
How's it going, Beelzebub?

381
00:39:22,406 --> 00:39:24,742
Okay. Can we go now?

382
00:39:25,534 --> 00:39:28,037
You may go.

383
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:33,584
Thanks, dude!

384
00:39:33,792 --> 00:39:38,547
You know, you got a bad rap,
but you're actually an okay dude!

385
00:39:52,353 --> 00:39:55,689
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

386
00:39:57,316 --> 00:40:00,319
Maybe we should try
one of these tunnels.

387
00:40:08,202 --> 00:40:10,830
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

388
00:40:11,622 --> 00:40:14,291
Maybe we should try
one of these doors.

389
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:21,715
After you, dude.

390
00:40:29,723 --> 00:40:31,475
Now where are we?

391
00:40:34,728 --> 00:40:35,813
Who's that?

392
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:41,902
It's Colonel Oats!

393
00:40:42,611 --> 00:40:44,238
No way!

394
00:40:44,613 --> 00:40:46,323
Gentlemen!

395
00:40:48,242 --> 00:40:51,036
Welcome to Hell.

396
00:40:51,287 --> 00:40:53,747
- No way.
- What?!

397
00:40:53,914 --> 00:40:55,541
No way, sir?

398
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:57,543
You two...

399
00:40:58,669 --> 00:41:02,256
...will do whatever
I tell you to do...

400
00:41:02,506 --> 00:41:05,384
...from now on.

401
00:41:05,593 --> 00:41:07,928
Is that clear?

402
00:41:09,013 --> 00:41:12,308
- Yes, sir, dude!
- What?!

403
00:41:12,892 --> 00:41:15,811
- Yes, dude, sir!
- What?!

404
00:41:16,395 --> 00:41:18,230
Yes, sir, sir dude!

405
00:41:18,397 --> 00:41:21,233
Get down and give me...

406
00:41:21,442 --> 00:41:23,611
...infinity.

407
00:41:26,822 --> 00:41:31,118
Stupid, pathetic,
craven little cretins.

408
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:37,583
- I can't possibly do infinity pushups!
- Pitiful little morons.

409
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:40,503
- Maybe we can do girls' style.
- Jokers!

410
00:41:40,711 --> 00:41:45,174
You petty, base, bully,
bullock, bugger billies.

411
00:41:45,341 --> 00:41:49,136
You're not strong! You're silky boys!

412
00:41:49,637 --> 00:41:53,807
Silk comes from the butts
of Chinese worms.

413
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:59,230
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'll eat you up like butter cakes.

414
00:41:59,438 --> 00:42:01,857
Get back here!

415
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:07,404
- Dude.
- What?

416
00:42:07,655 --> 00:42:10,366
I think we're in
our own personal hell.

417
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:14,662
- Let's split up.
- That way he can't get us so bad.

418
00:42:35,057 --> 00:42:37,017
What happened?

419
00:43:03,961 --> 00:43:05,796
Bogus!

420
00:43:33,157 --> 00:43:37,828
Granny S. Preston, Esquire.

421
00:43:38,078 --> 00:43:39,538
No way.

422
00:43:49,924 --> 00:43:50,966
Theodore!

423
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:54,970
You made your brother cry.

424
00:43:55,721 --> 00:43:57,139
How about...

425
00:43:57,556 --> 00:43:59,183
...a kiss...

426
00:43:59,767 --> 00:44:04,313
...for your dear old granny, Bill?

427
00:44:11,237 --> 00:44:12,613
Come along.

428
00:44:20,454 --> 00:44:23,290
You stole Deacon's Easter basket.

429
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:27,002
No way. This was 10 years ago!

430
00:44:35,886 --> 00:44:36,887
Come here!

431
00:44:41,642 --> 00:44:45,521
That was non, non, non...
Non-heinous!

432
00:44:45,729 --> 00:44:47,064
Choose...

433
00:44:47,273 --> 00:44:48,524
...your...

434
00:44:48,732 --> 00:44:50,818
...eternity.

435
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:57,533
Choose your own, you fag!

436
00:45:06,333 --> 00:45:11,172
You ugly, red source of all evil!

437
00:45:18,137 --> 00:45:20,848
Hello, girls.

438
00:45:30,483 --> 00:45:31,650
- Dude.
- What?

439
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:33,986
- Hell sucks!
- Definitely!

440
00:45:34,195 --> 00:45:38,908
- You no-nosed salamanders!
- Deac's Easter basket!

441
00:45:42,578 --> 00:45:43,913
Come to Oatsie!

442
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:50,544
I want one right on the lips!

443
00:45:51,837 --> 00:45:57,134
- There's only one way out!
- Right. We gotta play the Reaper!

444
00:46:03,807 --> 00:46:06,393
Choose your game.

445
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:09,146
But if you lose...

446
00:46:09,396 --> 00:46:12,066
...you will stay here in Hell...

447
00:46:12,858 --> 00:46:14,610
...forever.

448
00:46:31,418 --> 00:46:33,796
D-1.

449
00:46:38,425 --> 00:46:39,426
Miss.

450
00:46:48,602 --> 00:46:49,937
B...

451
00:46:50,187 --> 00:46:51,355
...3.

452
00:46:52,773 --> 00:46:54,483
Miss.

453
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:58,863
C-6.

454
00:47:03,284 --> 00:47:04,451
Hit.

455
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:11,125
- Dude...
- I know.

456
00:47:17,923 --> 00:47:20,259
J-7.

457
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,429
J-7...

458
00:47:25,014 --> 00:47:26,015
Hit.

459
00:47:27,808 --> 00:47:31,812
A hit. You have sunk my battleship.

460
00:47:32,521 --> 00:47:33,564
Excellent!

461
00:47:35,983 --> 00:47:39,153
- I knew he put it in the J's.
- Good thinking.

462
00:47:39,361 --> 00:47:41,363
You must play me again.

463
00:47:41,989 --> 00:47:46,035
- What?!
- Best two out of three.

464
00:47:46,243 --> 00:47:47,453
No way!

465
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:53,209
Yes way.

466
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,928
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

467
00:48:14,647 --> 00:48:16,774
I believe...

468
00:48:16,941 --> 00:48:21,070
...Col. Mustard did it
in the study with the candlestick.

469
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,623
Sorry, Death. You lose.
It was Professor Plum.

470
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:36,836
- I said "Plum."
- No way. You said "Mustard!"

471
00:48:37,044 --> 00:48:38,379
Can we go back now?

472
00:48:40,756 --> 00:48:42,424
Best three out of five.

473
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:45,845
I don't believe this guy.

474
00:48:57,773 --> 00:49:00,276
- Best of seven?
- Damn right!

475
00:49:05,156 --> 00:49:07,158
Right hand, green.

476
00:49:12,037 --> 00:49:14,081
Left hand, red.

477
00:49:18,419 --> 00:49:20,588
Right foot, green.

478
00:49:21,255 --> 00:49:22,715
Right foot...

479
00:49:49,074 --> 00:49:50,242
Well?

480
00:49:55,414 --> 00:49:56,832
I will...

481
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:00,294
...take you back.

482
00:50:07,551 --> 00:50:12,306
- You played very well.
- Especially with your heavy robes.

483
00:50:12,515 --> 00:50:14,308
Don't patronize me.

484
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:18,771
Whatever. You got a lot
to learn about sportsmanship.

485
00:50:19,897 --> 00:50:21,398
This way.

486
00:50:22,525 --> 00:50:24,401
Now we can save the babes.

487
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:28,656
But, Bill, how will we fight
those other usses?

488
00:50:28,864 --> 00:50:32,910
They're totally stronger than us.
And way smarter.

489
00:50:33,118 --> 00:50:36,038
Plus, they already killed us once.

490
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:39,333
One minute, duder!

491
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:45,005
If we were good human usses and we had
to fight two evil robot usses...

492
00:50:45,214 --> 00:50:48,759
...what would we do?
- Make good robot usses?

493
00:50:48,968 --> 00:50:51,470
Good thinking, dude!

494
00:50:51,846 --> 00:50:52,888
Excuse us.

495
00:50:53,222 --> 00:50:55,933
- Excuse me, Death?
- Oh, now what?

496
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:59,436
Could you take us to someone
who could help us?

497
00:50:59,645 --> 00:51:03,065
You have beaten me.
I am at your command.

498
00:51:03,315 --> 00:51:04,567
Cool!

499
00:51:04,733 --> 00:51:06,402
This way.

500
00:51:07,945 --> 00:51:09,697
- Ted.
- What?

501
00:51:09,905 --> 00:51:11,907
Don't fear the Reaper.

502
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:14,952
I heard that.

503
00:51:27,464 --> 00:51:30,301
This is most atypical.

504
00:51:54,825 --> 00:51:56,494
Welcome to Heaven.

505
00:51:58,746 --> 00:52:00,706
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

506
00:52:01,373 --> 00:52:02,666
Thank you.

507
00:52:04,835 --> 00:52:06,045
Through there.

508
00:52:06,253 --> 00:52:07,880
Welcome to Heaven.

509
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:11,133
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

510
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:17,056
"Only the most serene and enlightened
souls shall gain audience."

511
00:52:17,264 --> 00:52:19,308
Dude, we're in big trouble.

512
00:52:21,769 --> 00:52:23,813
I think I have an idea.

513
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:34,490
Wise dudes.

514
00:52:34,824 --> 00:52:36,867
Can we ask you a question?

515
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:39,286
Right this way, please.

516
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:53,676
We're in Heaven,
and we just mugged three people.

517
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:57,137
We better leave
before we ruin it for everybody.

518
00:53:00,099 --> 00:53:01,976
Come on, Death.

519
00:53:02,852 --> 00:53:04,854
You look great, dude.

520
00:53:06,147 --> 00:53:07,731
You think so?

521
00:53:12,736 --> 00:53:14,238
You do.

522
00:53:17,158 --> 00:53:18,826
Shut up.

523
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:22,413
- Come on, dude.
- It's not funny.

524
00:53:23,205 --> 00:53:25,583
I can't believe I'm doing this.

525
00:53:25,791 --> 00:53:28,794
How did I end up in this situation?

526
00:53:48,439 --> 00:53:49,648
How's it going?

527
00:53:51,275 --> 00:53:53,277
What is the meaning of life?

528
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:07,500
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>

529
00:54:07,750 --> 00:54:11,837
<i>Just like every night has its dawn</i>

530
00:54:12,046 --> 00:54:15,049
<i>Just like every cowboy</i>

531
00:54:15,216 --> 00:54:19,470
<i>Sings a sad, sad song</i>

532
00:54:24,475 --> 00:54:27,686
<i>Every rose has a thorn</i>

533
00:54:30,105 --> 00:54:31,565
Don't I know you?

534
00:54:33,317 --> 00:54:34,527
No.

535
00:55:16,652 --> 00:55:20,406
So, God, as if you didn't know...

536
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:25,578
...we're not the three wise people
you might have thought we were.

537
00:55:25,786 --> 00:55:30,166
We mugged three people and took
their clothes. Sorry.

538
00:55:30,374 --> 00:55:34,003
- I'm Bill S. Preston.
- I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

539
00:55:34,211 --> 00:55:38,883
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

540
00:55:40,718 --> 00:55:43,345
This lovely lady is the Grim Reaper.

541
00:55:43,554 --> 00:55:46,807
He brought us when we
challenged him and won.

542
00:55:49,185 --> 00:55:54,231
First, congratulations on Earth!
It's a most excellent planet.

543
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:59,320
- We enjoy it on a daily basis.
- Not to mention your other planets.

544
00:55:59,528 --> 00:56:03,491
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus.

545
00:56:05,951 --> 00:56:09,580
But the point is, we died.

546
00:56:09,788 --> 00:56:12,249
Most unfairly.

547
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,461
But we won the chance to come back.

548
00:56:15,669 --> 00:56:19,507
We gotta construct something
to save the women we love.

549
00:56:20,174 --> 00:56:23,719
And there's not a lot of time.
So we were wondering...

550
00:56:23,969 --> 00:56:27,431
...could you help us
find somebody to help us?

551
00:56:28,182 --> 00:56:30,601
<i>Station.</i>

552
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:33,729
We were thinking along the lines...

553
00:56:33,896 --> 00:56:37,191
...of maybe a scientist or something.

554
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:52,081
Cool.

555
00:56:55,334 --> 00:56:57,127
Thanks, God.

556
00:56:57,419 --> 00:57:01,257
Yeah. You're a just and noble creator.

557
00:57:02,591 --> 00:57:06,136
- We'll be going now.
- Keep up the good work.

558
00:57:06,345 --> 00:57:08,389
Catch you later, God.

559
00:57:18,691 --> 00:57:22,528
Sorry. They melvined me.

560
00:57:28,367 --> 00:57:31,412
All right, upside-down cake!

561
00:57:31,579 --> 00:57:34,373
- Hey, Evil Ted.
- What?

562
00:57:39,628 --> 00:57:41,422
We're out of dishes.

563
00:57:42,923 --> 00:57:44,884
Check this out.

564
00:57:48,262 --> 00:57:50,806
Not bad, E.T.

565
00:57:52,975 --> 00:57:54,226
Let me try.

566
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,694
You totally didn't see the fan.

567
00:58:08,782 --> 00:58:12,036
Tell my body to get over here
and get me!

568
00:58:12,495 --> 00:58:15,414
That's all right. I'll get you.

569
00:58:16,999 --> 00:58:19,460
Got your head, dude.

570
00:58:22,254 --> 00:58:25,007
I'm totally gonna tackle you, dude.

571
00:58:28,302 --> 00:58:33,140
- Touchdown for Evil Ted!
- We're total headbangers.

572
00:58:36,393 --> 00:58:39,730
Come on. There you go.

573
00:58:45,653 --> 00:58:49,573
Stop wasting time.
Proceed with the plan now.

574
00:58:49,824 --> 00:58:51,534
<i>Okay, dude.</i>

575
00:58:52,493 --> 00:58:55,871
<i>What do you say
we trash their relationships?</i>

576
00:58:58,541 --> 00:59:00,125
I hate them.

577
00:59:00,334 --> 00:59:03,504
I hate the robot versions of them.

578
00:59:03,963 --> 00:59:05,881
<i>You made us, dude.</i>

579
00:59:13,013 --> 00:59:15,391
Looks like this is the place.

580
00:59:15,641 --> 00:59:18,519
Now all we gotta do
is find that scientist.

581
00:59:19,603 --> 00:59:23,149
- What kind of name is Station?
- I don't know.

582
00:59:23,357 --> 00:59:25,734
Must be some kind of future guy.

583
00:59:31,407 --> 00:59:33,409
Okay, how many syllables?

584
00:59:35,578 --> 00:59:37,872
Is it a play or a song or...?

585
00:59:40,124 --> 00:59:41,542
It's something big.

586
00:59:43,169 --> 00:59:45,421
My money's on Einstein.

587
00:59:48,174 --> 00:59:49,717
That's Station?

588
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:53,888
Did you assume
the most brilliant scientist...

589
00:59:54,054 --> 00:59:57,850
...in the universe
would be from Earth?

590
00:59:58,934 --> 01:00:00,352
Yeah.

591
01:00:05,316 --> 01:00:06,942
Movies?

592
01:00:07,902 --> 01:00:10,279
- Nine words.
- Good, Mr. Franklin.

593
01:00:10,488 --> 01:00:12,823
Fire? Cigarettes?

594
01:00:13,032 --> 01:00:15,659
- Clouds, clouds.
- Smoke?

595
01:00:16,785 --> 01:00:20,039
<i>Butch and Sundance: The Early Years.</i>

596
01:00:25,961 --> 01:00:29,298
- Death!
- Sorry.

597
01:00:32,635 --> 01:00:35,638
<i>Smokey and the Bandit III.</i>

598
01:00:35,846 --> 01:00:38,682
Smokey is the bandit!

599
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:50,903
Excuse us. Martians?

600
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:54,949
First, my friend,
Bill and I congratulate you...

601
01:00:55,157 --> 01:00:58,244
...on a well-played round of charades.

602
01:00:58,452 --> 01:01:00,704
You've been referred to us...

603
01:01:00,913 --> 01:01:04,750
...as the most brilliant scientists
in the universe.

604
01:01:06,377 --> 01:01:09,380
Would you help us build
good robot usses...

605
01:01:09,588 --> 01:01:13,467
...to save two princesses
from bad robot usses?

606
01:01:22,893 --> 01:01:25,146
Sounds good, Station.

607
01:01:28,816 --> 01:01:30,651
Let's rock, Death.

608
01:01:59,054 --> 01:02:01,807
- We're alive.
- Yeah.

609
01:02:01,974 --> 01:02:06,479
But I think a buzzard
was pecking at my head.

610
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:14,612
Dinner's over, worm-dude.

611
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:20,117
You guys okay?

612
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:23,496
Where's Death?

613
01:02:32,588 --> 01:02:34,006
You okay, dude?

614
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:39,762
I'm fine.

615
01:02:46,769 --> 01:02:50,189
First, we go back to town
and clean up.

616
01:02:50,397 --> 01:02:52,733
Second, we warn the princesses.

617
01:02:52,900 --> 01:02:56,821
Third, we buy stuff
to build good robot usses.

618
01:02:58,823 --> 01:03:00,533
Let's go.

619
01:03:03,577 --> 01:03:05,746
What? What?

620
01:03:20,511 --> 01:03:24,056
Here, kitty, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!

621
01:03:24,306 --> 01:03:25,975
There's one, dude!

622
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:29,728
Just missed, dude.

623
01:03:30,604 --> 01:03:32,898
Dude, we're there.

624
01:03:33,107 --> 01:03:34,817
Okay. I got an idea.

625
01:03:56,255 --> 01:03:58,591
How's it going, lady humans?

626
01:04:27,328 --> 01:04:30,414
Okay, this is Builders Emporium...

627
01:04:30,581 --> 01:04:34,502
...a repository for electronics
and robot materials.

628
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:38,214
Get what you need to make metal usses.

629
01:04:42,009 --> 01:04:46,180
- Ready for the big night?
- No! We're not going.

630
01:04:48,891 --> 01:04:51,977
I think you guys
should stop right there.

631
01:04:53,103 --> 01:04:55,481
Catch you later, future wife.

632
01:04:57,858 --> 01:04:59,485
Evil breath!

633
01:04:59,777 --> 01:05:00,778
Who are you?

634
01:05:00,986 --> 01:05:03,113
Well, you see...

635
01:05:15,167 --> 01:05:16,502
Come on.

636
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:22,174
- Any luck?
- They're not at our place or theirs.

637
01:05:22,341 --> 01:05:26,846
I'll try your dad's.
Maybe they went to talk to Missy.

638
01:05:35,813 --> 01:05:37,314
Logan residence.

639
01:05:37,523 --> 01:05:40,860
Evil Bill S. Preston,
Esquire, speaking.

640
01:05:43,445 --> 01:05:46,866
It's them! They're back from the dead.

641
01:05:47,074 --> 01:05:49,285
We get to kill them again.

642
01:05:49,493 --> 01:05:50,744
Excellent!

643
01:06:06,635 --> 01:06:08,971
See you real soon.

644
01:06:12,850 --> 01:06:16,145
- But this time we're ready for you!
- Yeah!

645
01:06:19,773 --> 01:06:22,234
We can be ready for them too.

646
01:06:22,443 --> 01:06:25,488
Good luck getting
in the concert, losers!

647
01:06:32,161 --> 01:06:35,831
<i>- Initiate the final plan.
- You got it, great one.</i>

648
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,919
<i>Do not fail me.</i>

649
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:42,546
<i>Metallic buffoons.</i>

650
01:06:48,594 --> 01:06:51,764
- That other me is a dick.
- Yeah.

651
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:56,811
I hope the Stations
know what they're doing.

652
01:07:16,288 --> 01:07:18,749
Station! What are you doing?

653
01:07:20,918 --> 01:07:24,755
Dudes! This is no time
to be playing games!

654
01:09:44,812 --> 01:09:46,856
That one's me, right?

655
01:09:50,234 --> 01:09:51,986
Not bad.

656
01:09:52,194 --> 01:09:54,738
How's it going, Good Robot Bill?

657
01:09:55,614 --> 01:09:57,449
How's it doing?

658
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,297
<i>Kate Axelrod for KJM...</i>

659
01:10:11,505 --> 01:10:15,426
<i>... reporting live from
the San Dimas Auditorium.</i>

660
01:10:15,634 --> 01:10:18,721
<i>We're rocking at
the Battle of the Bands.</i>

661
01:10:18,929 --> 01:10:22,349
<i>So stay tuned and hold tight
until we find out...</i>

662
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:25,811
<i>... who will be your winner.</i>

663
01:10:35,905 --> 01:10:37,281
Ready? You're up.

664
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:38,908
Where are the girls?

665
01:10:39,116 --> 01:10:43,496
- Hanging from the rafters.
- We'll kill them at the finale.

666
01:10:44,330 --> 01:10:46,332
Good luck, gentlemen.

667
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:54,548
Check it out.

668
01:10:56,634 --> 01:10:58,010
Not bad.

669
01:11:23,619 --> 01:11:26,956
Let's hear it for Primus!

670
01:12:04,618 --> 01:12:07,246
- Are they ready?
- Station.

671
01:12:07,413 --> 01:12:09,290
Excellent work, dude.

672
01:12:09,456 --> 01:12:13,544
- What about me? I made the wigs.
- Okay, Death.

673
01:12:13,794 --> 01:12:17,089
I helped do the shopping.
I pushed the cart.

674
01:12:17,214 --> 01:12:20,509
- Do they work like we asked?
- Station.

675
01:12:23,929 --> 01:12:27,057
You're a most excellent scientist.

676
01:12:27,766 --> 01:12:31,353
Plus, you got an excellently huge
Martian butt.

677
01:12:36,859 --> 01:12:40,446
Feel free to split
in two parts again and relax.

678
01:12:40,613 --> 01:12:44,950
Don't overlook my butt.
I work out all the time.

679
01:12:45,159 --> 01:12:48,245
And reaping burns a lot of calories.

680
01:12:52,791 --> 01:12:57,755
Ready to take on those evil usses
and save the babes?

681
01:12:59,381 --> 01:13:03,385
<i>Fight evil usses. Save the babes.</i>

682
01:13:03,552 --> 01:13:06,347
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

683
01:13:07,598 --> 01:13:09,475
Let's go get 'em.

684
01:13:09,683 --> 01:13:12,436
And now, the last band of the evening.

685
01:13:12,645 --> 01:13:15,397
Wyld Stallyns!

686
01:13:26,116 --> 01:13:28,494
How's it going, worms?

687
01:13:28,994 --> 01:13:31,705
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

688
01:13:31,956 --> 01:13:34,583
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan!

689
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:39,547
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

690
01:13:41,090 --> 01:13:43,217
Hold it right there!

691
01:13:46,345 --> 01:13:48,597
We're Wyld Stallyns!

692
01:13:48,848 --> 01:13:52,726
No, dudes. We're Wyld Stallyns!

693
01:13:55,354 --> 01:13:59,400
You totally killed us,
you evil metal dickweeds!

694
01:13:59,650 --> 01:14:02,236
Yeah, and we're gonna do it again!

695
01:14:02,444 --> 01:14:06,240
Plus, we're gonna totally
kill your girlfriends.

696
01:14:14,373 --> 01:14:17,793
Don't worry, babes! We'll save you.

697
01:14:20,462 --> 01:14:24,008
Everybody, say hello
to Station's creation!

698
01:14:24,300 --> 01:14:27,261
Good Robot Bill and Ted!

699
01:14:40,733 --> 01:14:42,776
We may have met our match.

700
01:14:43,068 --> 01:14:46,155
Kudos to you, good human usses.

701
01:14:47,990 --> 01:14:52,453
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

702
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:31,116
- Elizabeth!
- Theodore!

703
01:15:31,617 --> 01:15:34,495
- Joanna!
- William!

704
01:15:47,508 --> 01:15:49,301
Who is that?

705
01:16:06,902 --> 01:16:07,987
Who are you?

706
01:16:09,155 --> 01:16:10,865
Who am I?

707
01:16:17,788 --> 01:16:20,499
I am De Nomolos.

708
01:16:21,542 --> 01:16:23,502
I am their master.

709
01:16:25,087 --> 01:16:28,507
And I must see to it that you die.

710
01:16:31,218 --> 01:16:32,928
But first...

711
01:16:58,329 --> 01:17:03,417
<i>We are now transmitting on every
channel throughout the world.</i>

712
01:17:03,918 --> 01:17:05,836
My word!

713
01:17:10,341 --> 01:17:13,552
<i>I want the whole universe
to behold this...</i>

714
01:17:13,761 --> 01:17:16,430
<i>... transfer of power.</i>

715
01:17:17,848 --> 01:17:20,893
<i>No longer will our future society...</i>

716
01:17:21,101 --> 01:17:24,271
<i>... be based on
the ideas and the music...</i>

717
01:17:24,522 --> 01:17:27,024
<i>... of these two fools!</i>

718
01:17:29,568 --> 01:17:32,571
<i>They will be based on my ideas...</i>

719
01:17:34,532 --> 01:17:36,992
...and my ideas alone!

720
01:17:38,369 --> 01:17:41,372
How do we get out of this?
There's no time.

721
01:17:41,497 --> 01:17:45,292
We do. After we get away
from this guy...

722
01:17:45,459 --> 01:17:50,548
...we time-travel back and set up
the things we need to get him now.

723
01:17:50,756 --> 01:17:52,675
Yeah, like what?

724
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:55,344
Like a sandbag.

725
01:18:01,225 --> 01:18:02,560
Excellent!

726
01:18:02,768 --> 01:18:04,895
Then we'll get a cage.

727
01:18:12,361 --> 01:18:13,946
My friends.

728
01:18:14,613 --> 01:18:17,032
I too can play the time game.

729
01:18:17,241 --> 01:18:20,536
If you do that,
once I have vanquished you...

730
01:18:20,786 --> 01:18:24,832
...I'll go back and set up this key.

731
01:18:35,301 --> 01:18:38,053
And another gun.

732
01:18:47,813 --> 01:18:51,734
Right. Only there's one thing
you didn't think of.

733
01:18:51,942 --> 01:18:55,112
Only the winners can go back
and set things up.

734
01:18:55,321 --> 01:18:57,323
And that's gonna be us.

735
01:18:57,531 --> 01:19:01,577
We set up the key,
and we set up the gun.

736
01:19:04,163 --> 01:19:06,165
Excuse me.

737
01:19:06,373 --> 01:19:09,335
Your shoelaces are untied.

738
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:17,426
Melvined.

739
01:19:31,357 --> 01:19:32,900
You're under arrest.

740
01:19:33,067 --> 01:19:34,819
Way to go, Dad!

741
01:19:39,657 --> 01:19:41,534
Book him, Danno.

742
01:19:48,541 --> 01:19:50,167
Good job, Death.

743
01:19:55,422 --> 01:19:57,174
Who was that guy?

744
01:19:57,341 --> 01:20:00,469
I can answer that question.

745
01:20:00,803 --> 01:20:03,097
Ms. Wardroe, thanks for the help.

746
01:20:03,764 --> 01:20:05,808
We definitely...

747
01:20:06,517 --> 01:20:08,519
Take it off, baby!

748
01:20:17,027 --> 01:20:18,571
Rufus!

749
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:20,114
When did you get here?

750
01:20:20,447 --> 01:20:22,658
Just in time for your audition.

751
01:20:22,992 --> 01:20:26,328
So you were Ms. Wardroe all along.

752
01:20:27,246 --> 01:20:30,207
Would anyone else have let you
in this contest?

753
01:20:34,211 --> 01:20:37,506
That was Chuck De Nomolos,
my old gym teacher.

754
01:20:37,673 --> 01:20:42,178
And, by the way, sit-up champion
of the 27th century.

755
01:20:42,386 --> 01:20:46,891
And now, gentlemen, I believe
the stage belongs to you.

756
01:20:47,057 --> 01:20:48,476
Thanks, Rufus.

757
01:21:01,614 --> 01:21:04,200
<i>Dude, we still don't know how to play.</i>

758
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,869
Maybe we ought to get good.

759
01:21:07,119 --> 01:21:08,329
How?

760
01:21:30,601 --> 01:21:34,772
That was a fast 16 months
of intensive guitar training.

761
01:21:35,981 --> 01:21:39,193
Except for the two-week
medieval honeymoon.

762
01:21:41,153 --> 01:21:43,614
Hello, San Dimas!

763
01:21:44,907 --> 01:21:47,284
Let me introduce you
to a little friend.

764
01:21:47,576 --> 01:21:49,245
This is little Ted.

765
01:21:49,787 --> 01:21:52,206
Hello, little Ted!

766
01:21:52,414 --> 01:21:54,291
This is little Bill.

767
01:21:57,837 --> 01:22:01,006
Now for the rest of our band.

768
01:22:04,218 --> 01:22:09,014
On conga and bongos, proof that
you can't tell a book by its cover...

769
01:22:09,223 --> 01:22:11,934
...the dude who can make one word
mean anything...

770
01:22:12,143 --> 01:22:14,061
...Station!

771
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,734
Our backup dancers...

772
01:22:20,901 --> 01:22:23,612
...Station's most bodacious
creations...

773
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:26,615
...the Good Robot Usses!

774
01:22:32,997 --> 01:22:34,165
And over here...

775
01:22:34,373 --> 01:22:37,334
...our bass player,
the Duke of Spooks...

776
01:22:37,543 --> 01:22:40,296
...the Doc of Shocks,
the Man With No Tan...

777
01:22:40,504 --> 01:22:43,340
...please say hello
to Death himself...

778
01:22:43,591 --> 01:22:45,384
...the Grim Reaper!

779
01:22:53,184 --> 01:22:55,811
<i>You might be a king
Or a little street sweeper</i>

780
01:22:55,978 --> 01:22:59,398
<i>But sooner or later
You dance with the Reaper</i>

781
01:23:04,278 --> 01:23:06,906
Get down with your bad self!

782
01:23:13,496 --> 01:23:16,165
I love show business.

783
01:23:17,374 --> 01:23:19,168
Ladies and gentlemen...

784
01:23:19,835 --> 01:23:21,879
...we've been to the past.

785
01:23:22,254 --> 01:23:24,089
We've been to the future.

786
01:23:24,507 --> 01:23:26,926
We've been all around the afterlife.

787
01:23:27,468 --> 01:23:28,928
And you know...

788
01:23:31,013 --> 01:23:33,015
The best place to be...

789
01:23:35,935 --> 01:23:37,311
...is here.

790
01:23:38,354 --> 01:23:40,314
And the best time to be...

791
01:23:40,773 --> 01:23:42,233
...is now.

792
01:23:48,072 --> 01:23:50,825
And all we can say is...

793
01:23:52,785 --> 01:23:54,036
...let's rock!

794
01:23:55,246 --> 01:23:56,789
One! Two!

795
01:23:56,997 --> 01:23:59,750
One, two, three, four!

796
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:27,004
Right good! Right good!

797
01:27:59,532 --> 01:28:01,534
<i>You are go, Stallyn!</i>

798
01:28:02,535 --> 01:28:04,829
<i>Come home soon. We'll miss you.</i>
