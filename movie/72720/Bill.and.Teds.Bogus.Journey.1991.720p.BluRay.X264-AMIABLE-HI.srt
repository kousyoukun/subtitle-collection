How?

982
01:21:25,966 --> 01:21:27,836
[BUTTONS PRESSING]

983
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:46,896
That was a fast 16 months
of intensive guitar training, dude.

984
01:21:47,070 --> 01:21:51,620
Yeah, except for that two-week
medieval honeymoon.

985
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:56,040
Hello, San Dimas!

986
01:21:56,246 --> 01:21:57,156
Hello!

987
01:21:57,372 --> 01:21:59,672
Want to introduce you
to a little friend of mine.

988
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,630
This is little Ted.

989
01:22:02,252 --> 01:22:04,592
Hello, little Ted!

990
01:22:04,838 --> 01:22:06,718
This is little Bill.

991
01:22:06,923 --> 01:22:08,723
Hello, little Bill!

992
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:14,640
Now for the rest of our band. Ted?

993
01:22:16,683 --> 01:22:21,443
On conga and bongos, proof positive
that you can't tell a book by its cover...

994
01:22:21,730 --> 01:22:24,360
the dude who can make one word
mean anything...

995
01:22:24,649 --> 01:22:26,529
Station!

996
01:22:31,656 --> 01:22:33,156
Our backup dancers...

997
01:22:33,408 --> 01:22:36,078
Station's most bodacious creations...

998
01:22:36,286 --> 01:22:38,996
the Good Robot Usses!

999
01:22:45,420 --> 01:22:46,550
And over here...

1000
01:22:46,838 --> 01:22:49,718
our bass player, the Duke of Spooks...

1001
01:22:50,008 --> 01:22:52,678
the Doc of Shocks, the Man With No Tan...

1002
01:22:52,928 --> 01:22:55,758
please say hello to Death himself...

1003
01:22:56,056 --> 01:22:58,056
the Grim Reaper!

1004
01:22:59,935 --> 01:23:03,475
# [STEVE VAI FEAT. WILLIAM SADLER'S
"MEET THE REAPER" PLAYING] #

1005
01:23:05,649 --> 01:23:08,279
You might be a king
Or a little street sweeper

1006
01:23:08,485 --> 01:23:11,855
But sooner or later
You dance with the Reaper

1007
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:19,325
Get down with your bad self!

1008
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:29,589
I love show business. [LAUGHS]

1009
01:23:29,798 --> 01:23:31,588
Ladies and gentlemen...

1010
01:23:32,258 --> 01:23:34,298
we've been to the past.

1011
01:23:34,678 --> 01:23:36,508
We've been to the future.

1012
01:23:36,930 --> 01:23:39,310
We've been all around the afterlife.

1013
01:23:39,933 --> 01:23:42,733
And you know... Ted?

1014
01:23:43,478 --> 01:23:45,438
The best place to be...

1015
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:49,780
is here.

1016
01:23:50,819 --> 01:23:52,739
And the best time to be...

1017
01:23:53,279 --> 01:23:54,699
is now.

1018
01:24:00,578 --> 01:24:03,208
And all's we can say is...

1019
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:06,418
let's rock!

1020
01:24:07,669 --> 01:24:09,209
One! Two!

1021
01:24:09,462 --> 01:24:12,172
One, two, three, four!

1022

[OVER RADIO] Stallyns One...

1026
01:27:47,972 --> 01:27:51,562
Stallyns One, you are clear to leave...

1027
01:27:52,227 --> 01:27:53,517
Drums...

1028
01:27:53,728 --> 01:27:55,518
- Ten... nine...
- Keyboards...

1029
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:56,980
- ...eight...
- Affirmative.

1030
01:27:57,190 --> 01:27:59,280
Ignition sequence start. Engines on.

- ...five... four... three... two...
- That's a check.

1032
01:28:02,403 --> 01:28:04,203
- ...one.
- Good luck boys.

1033
01:28:11,996 --> 01:28:13,916
You are go, Stallyns One!

1034
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:17,248
Come home soon. We'll miss you.
