1
00:00:32,938 --> 00:00:34,815
It is time.

2
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,614
They've reached the second crucial
turning point in their destiny.

3
00:00:42,781 --> 00:00:47,328
Their message is about to
reach millions.

4
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:51,248
But... we will change all that.

5
00:00:52,916 --> 00:00:56,003
When our mission is successful...

6
00:00:56,211 --> 00:01:00,341
...no longer will the world
be dominated...

7
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:05,804
...by the legacy of these two fools!

8
00:01:06,013 --> 00:01:09,266
No longer will we hear this:

9
00:01:09,933 --> 00:01:11,935
We will stop them now!

10
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,105
Brothers and sisters...

11
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:18,525
...are we ready?

12
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,495
- Greetings, my excellent pupils.
- Station.

13
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:57,958
Let's continue our study of the
physics of acoustical reverberation.

14
00:02:58,208 --> 00:03:01,670
Meet today's most non-bogus
guest speakers.

15
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:03,881
Say hello to Thomas Edison.

16
00:03:04,798 --> 00:03:05,799
Hello there.

17
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:08,177
To help us on the musical side:

18
00:03:08,469 --> 00:03:10,262
Johann Sebastian Bach.

19
00:03:13,557 --> 00:03:16,560
And Sir James Martin
of Faith No More...

20
00:03:17,269 --> 00:03:21,857
...founder of the Faith No More
Spiritual and Theological Center.

21
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:27,446
- Station!
- Station!

22
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,574
And a special treat
from the 23rd century:

23
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:32,534
Miss Ria Paschelle.

24
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:39,792
Miss Paschelle is
the inventor of the...

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,629
...statiophonicoxygeneticamp-
lifiagraphiphonideliverberator.

26
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:46,757
Hard to imagine the world
without them, isn't it?

27
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:52,221
Remember, this Friday, Ben Franklin
and Aretha Franklin will be here.

28
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:57,434
Saturday is the field trip
to Babylonia. And very important:

29
00:03:57,685 --> 00:04:03,023
Do not do your homework without
wearing headphones...

30
00:05:00,247 --> 00:05:03,208
De Nomolos. My old teacher.

31
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:08,297
Rufus.
My favorite pupil.

32
00:05:09,089 --> 00:05:11,050
- I thought you were...
- Dead?

33
00:05:11,675 --> 00:05:13,177
No.

34
00:05:14,011 --> 00:05:15,971
Just in preparation.

35
00:05:18,265 --> 00:05:22,978
I worked within the system
until I could stand it no longer.

36
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:24,980
And soon...

37
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:31,236
...soon the system
will never have existed.

38
00:05:32,237 --> 00:05:35,074
- You won't get away with it.
- Time will tell.

39
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,825
Time has told.

40
00:05:37,076 --> 00:05:42,831
I'll go back and change that,
with the aid of my secret weapons!

41
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:49,672
How's it going, dudes?

42
00:06:08,899 --> 00:06:13,153
Friends, friends, friends.
These are automatons.

43
00:06:13,445 --> 00:06:17,574
Replicas only.
Furnished with my agenda.

44
00:06:18,325 --> 00:06:20,536
Now, what is your mission?

45
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:25,833
- First, we totally kill Bill and Ted.
- Then we take over their lives.

46
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:28,377
Then we utterly destroy them.

47
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:33,507
At the Battle of the Bands, we give
their speech except totally different.

48
00:06:33,799 --> 00:06:37,678
And thus a new future is born.
A great future.

49
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:40,305
Don't tell us.
You programmed us.

50
00:06:40,514 --> 00:06:43,267
- He's totally a robot!
- So are you!

51
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,352
We're total metal heads!

52
00:06:46,603 --> 00:06:48,063
Shut up.

53
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:53,193
Now.

54
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,488
- What is the fuel?
- Fear!

55
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:59,366
- What is the engine?
- Discipline!

56
00:06:59,575 --> 00:07:01,869
- What is the ideal?
- Order!

57
00:07:02,077 --> 00:07:04,163
And how do we achieve it?

58
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:15,049
Death to Bill and Ted!

59
00:07:18,385 --> 00:07:21,096
Catch you later, evil dude.

60
00:08:03,597 --> 00:08:06,100
I am Bill S. Preston...

61
00:08:06,308 --> 00:08:08,018
...Esquire!

62
00:08:10,437 --> 00:08:14,358
This is Ted "Theodore" Logan!

63
00:08:16,944 --> 00:08:19,238
On drums and keyboards...

64
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:23,033
...celebrating their fifth year
in the 20th century...

65
00:08:23,242 --> 00:08:26,328
...the princesses
from medieval England.

66
00:08:26,704 --> 00:08:29,248
Joanna and Elizabeth.

67
00:08:30,624 --> 00:08:31,917
And we are...

68
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,379
...Wyld Stallyns.

69
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:43,303
You tell me you're
the greatest band, but you stink.

70
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:47,391
We don't understand it either.

71
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,184
You can't sing.

72
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:54,106
- The girls can play. But you guys?
- Girls mature faster than guys.

73
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:56,817
Plus, they started
in the 15th century.

74
00:08:57,109 --> 00:08:58,318
What do you mean?

75
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:01,822
- They're from medieval England.
- Ted, shut up.

76
00:09:02,281 --> 00:09:04,158
Medieval England, Iowa.

77
00:09:04,366 --> 00:09:08,746
The Battle of the Bands is
the biggest event in the area.

78
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:11,749
We're talking
about a $25,000 first prize...

79
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:16,378
...a two-year record deal and exposure
to people in the business.

80
00:09:16,628 --> 00:09:22,426
We're even live on Channel 12. If you
were me, would you put you guys on?

81
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:23,802
No way.

82
00:09:25,137 --> 00:09:28,891
Since you work for Pretzels 'N' Cheese,
I'll give you a shot.

83
00:09:29,099 --> 00:09:30,768
Excellent!

84
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:38,150
But last. Midnight.
By that time, everyone will be gone.

85
00:09:38,359 --> 00:09:40,903
That's all right.
We're used to that.

86
00:09:41,153 --> 00:09:44,531
We cleaned out Ted's brother's
junior high dance.

87
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,202
They turned on "La Bamba"
while he was playing his solo.

88
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,204
Shut up, Ted!

89
00:09:50,454 --> 00:09:54,500
Guys, do yourself a favor.
Prepare a little.

90
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:57,711
Work on your act.
Think of something.

91
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,298
Don't worry.
We won't let you down.

92
00:10:05,969 --> 00:10:10,015
- Dude, we gotta win.
- Then we could propose to the ladies.

93
00:10:11,183 --> 00:10:14,895
We can't raise a family on the
money from Pretzels 'N' Cheese.

94
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:19,233
I'll tell Missy we're on our way.

95
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,778
Should be a most resplendent
birthday party.

96
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:27,408
- Shall we, ladies?
- Great, sure.

97
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:51,390
So you have something
else to celebrate tonight.

98
00:10:51,932 --> 00:10:54,476
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

99
00:10:56,854 --> 00:11:00,190
If we win, I'll totally
pay you back your money.

100
00:11:00,649 --> 00:11:02,443
What if you don't win?

101
00:11:04,486 --> 00:11:08,782
Well, uh, I guess...

102
00:11:12,077 --> 00:11:16,665
- Maybe sell more blood.
- Think about selling the instruments.

103
00:11:16,874 --> 00:11:20,753
Of course, we've always got
a spot for you.

104
00:11:21,211 --> 00:11:25,549
Remember my friend, Colonel Oats
from the Alaskan Military School?

105
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:32,473
- "How's it going?"
- Yeah.

106
00:11:32,681 --> 00:11:34,558
Splendidly.

107
00:11:35,934 --> 00:11:37,227
Remember...

108
00:11:37,436 --> 00:11:40,022
...it's not too late for you, Ted.

109
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:48,072
For either of you.

110
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,241
For all four of you.

111
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,085
Fresh fudge.

112
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:03,754
Hi, Oatsie.

113
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:06,924
Darling.

114
00:12:08,634 --> 00:12:10,386
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Missy.

115
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:13,347
Hey, Missy.
I mean, Mom.

116
00:12:18,602 --> 00:12:21,730
I can't believe Missy
divorced your dad...

117
00:12:21,939 --> 00:12:23,565
...and married mine.

118
00:12:24,566 --> 00:12:26,110
Shut up, Ted.

119
00:12:31,573 --> 00:12:34,618
- Your dad looks bad.
- I know.

120
00:12:36,537 --> 00:12:37,746
What's next?

121
00:12:37,955 --> 00:12:42,835
- Maybe she'll marry you.
- Then you'll be your own stepdad.

122
00:12:48,632 --> 00:12:52,219
You probably noticed we haven't
given you our gifts yet.

123
00:12:52,428 --> 00:12:54,138
That's because...

124
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,813
That's because we wanted to say...

125
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:12,489
Excuse us, dude.

126
00:13:22,124 --> 00:13:23,751
I wrote this myself.

127
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:26,045
I wrote this last night.

128
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:32,217
"Elizabeth..."

129
00:13:32,426 --> 00:13:33,427
"Joanna...

130
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:38,640
...as I wander through this dark
and Ionely forest of life..."

131
00:13:38,849 --> 00:13:41,185
"...surrounded by various beasts..."

132
00:13:41,393 --> 00:13:44,480
"...bears, vipers, squirrels..."

133
00:13:44,688 --> 00:13:47,191
"Not to mention barnacles
and algae..."

134
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:51,487
"...man-of-wars, starfish,
blowfish, catfish..."

135
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,864
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

136
00:13:54,865 --> 00:13:59,078
The point is, I know we promised you
a better life than this.

137
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:05,375
What I mean to say is, I realize
when we took you out of England...

138
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:09,004
...we said the future held
some really good stuff.

139
00:14:09,213 --> 00:14:12,383
Although stuff hasn't
worked out how we thought...

140
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:16,011
...it will, we hope.

141
00:14:17,554 --> 00:14:20,099
The day after tomorrow,
if things work out...

142
00:14:20,808 --> 00:14:22,893
What this is about is...

143
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:32,611
- Will you...?
- Marry us?

144
00:14:39,576 --> 00:14:41,370
- Theodore...
- I'd love to.

145
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:27,499
- Aim for the cat, dude!
- I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

146
00:15:32,296 --> 00:15:34,048
Aw, just missed!

147
00:15:44,224 --> 00:15:48,479
- Not bad.
- Yeah, let's make it bad.

148
00:15:59,656 --> 00:16:01,116
We're here, dude.

149
00:16:02,159 --> 00:16:03,452
Is Rufus with you?

150
00:16:04,787 --> 00:16:05,829
One second.

151
00:16:17,466 --> 00:16:21,428
Looks like we lost him in the
circuits of time, duder.

152
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:24,973
Good.
Then he's gone forever.

153
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,560
Our first act of business:

154
00:16:28,769 --> 00:16:31,980
Destroy that ridiculous,
insipid band!

155
00:16:32,648 --> 00:16:34,483
You got it, dude!

156
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:36,652
Get to work.

157
00:16:38,654 --> 00:16:39,613
Now!

158
00:16:39,822 --> 00:16:41,532
Study these books well.

159
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:44,326
When my mission is completed...

160
00:16:44,535 --> 00:16:47,287
...this will be the new history.

161
00:16:48,747 --> 00:16:50,249
What a shithead.

162
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:57,297
- Bye!
- Bye!

163
00:16:58,465 --> 00:16:59,967
Drive safe!

164
00:17:01,468 --> 00:17:02,469
- Dude.
- What?

165
00:17:02,678 --> 00:17:06,140
After we're married,
will the girls stay with us?

166
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:09,268
Yeah, our girlfriends are
most chaste.

167
00:17:09,643 --> 00:17:13,480
- At least they're not dating our dads.
- Good point, dude.

168
00:17:18,777 --> 00:17:21,363
- Hello?
- This is Joanna.

169
00:17:21,572 --> 00:17:24,616
Joanna! How'd you call so fast?

170
00:17:24,825 --> 00:17:26,910
It's not important. This is:

171
00:17:27,161 --> 00:17:31,415
Elizabeth and I have decided
we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

172
00:17:31,582 --> 00:17:32,583
What?

173
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:33,959
- Yes!
- Why?

174
00:17:34,168 --> 00:17:37,129
You're losers and
we don't want to see you again.

175
00:17:37,296 --> 00:17:38,297
No way!

176
00:17:38,464 --> 00:17:44,470
We're going to the desert to be alone.
It's over. Goodbye.

177
00:17:51,477 --> 00:17:56,190
- I totally fooled them.
- Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

178
00:17:56,398 --> 00:17:57,441
Not!

179
00:17:58,567 --> 00:18:01,487
- Let's start phase two.
- Station.

180
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,351
<i>An incredible fortune in stones.</i>

181
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:36,939
<i>Yet I'd trade them all</i>
<i>for a hand phaser.</i>

182
00:18:38,315 --> 00:18:40,526
<i>Or a good solid club.</i>

183
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:44,947
Maybe we should've proposed
to them sooner.

184
00:18:46,907 --> 00:18:48,909
How could we, Ted?

185
00:18:49,118 --> 00:18:51,620
We could barely afford
our own apartment.

186
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:56,166
This is most non-non-heinous.

187
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,878
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta find them.

188
00:19:00,129 --> 00:19:01,338
Talk to them.

189
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,257
But how?

190
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:25,029
Who could that be?

191
00:19:32,202 --> 00:19:34,621
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

192
00:19:34,997 --> 00:19:37,416
Ted, it's us again.

193
00:19:38,208 --> 00:19:41,337
- How's it going, Bill?
- Not bad, Bill. And you?

194
00:19:41,462 --> 00:19:42,504
Bad.

195
00:19:43,630 --> 00:19:48,594
We came to help in your most
unfortunate situation.

196
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,603
How?

197
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:59,897
Come with us. We'll show you.

198
00:20:02,107 --> 00:20:03,484
Excuse us.

199
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:10,240
- I got a weird feeling here.
- Why?

200
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:12,076
I don't know.

201
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:15,954
How do we know they're really us?

202
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,336
We've been through this before.

203
00:20:22,503 --> 00:20:25,339
Without the intervention
of our future selves...

204
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:29,426
...would we have passed history?
Or met the babes?

205
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,514
Or had a most excellent adventure
through time?

206
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:42,523
Ted, if you're really me,
how many fingers am I gonna hold up?

207
00:20:42,731 --> 00:20:43,732
Three.

208
00:20:46,235 --> 00:20:47,986
You're right!

209
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:51,699
Let's go, guys.
We'll drive.

210
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:59,206
- Ted.
- What?

211
00:20:59,456 --> 00:21:04,211
I think we're about to embark
on an unprecedented expedition.

212
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:07,798
- Dude.
- What?

213
00:21:09,174 --> 00:21:12,136
I got a full-on robot chubby.

214
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:14,513
Later, Evil Ted.

215
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:16,265
Later.

216
00:21:30,946 --> 00:21:32,239
I'm cold.

217
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,453
Hey! Can we have some heat back here?

218
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:39,163
Shut up, Bill.

219
00:21:41,498 --> 00:21:43,709
That other you's a real jerk.

220
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:49,715
I'll be more considerate to myself
when I become him.

221
00:21:49,923 --> 00:21:52,009
He said, shut your holes!

222
00:21:54,928 --> 00:21:57,014
I got a very bad feeling.

223
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,216
Out.

224
00:22:39,723 --> 00:22:43,227
So where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

225
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:45,187
They're not here.

226
00:22:45,354 --> 00:22:49,608
We lied. Here's the truth,
we're gonna kill you now.

227
00:22:50,818 --> 00:22:52,736
- No way!
- Yes way, Ted.

228
00:22:53,237 --> 00:22:57,491
- We're programmed to do it.
- And we want to do it too.

229
00:22:58,242 --> 00:23:00,160
You dick, Bill!

230
00:23:04,456 --> 00:23:08,419
- You're metal, dude!
- I know. Check it out.

231
00:23:18,721 --> 00:23:19,722
Let's go.

232
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:21,932
Bogus.

233
00:23:58,177 --> 00:23:59,636
We gotta do something.

234
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,807
Dudes, even though
you're doing this...

235
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:07,394
...we, we...

236
00:24:07,603 --> 00:24:09,146
We love you.

237
00:24:09,396 --> 00:24:11,106
We love you.

238
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:14,777
Fags!

239
00:24:19,907 --> 00:24:23,118
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

240
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:44,723
Yes! I totally loogied on that
good dead me!

241
00:24:46,266 --> 00:24:49,812
- We're fully, full-on evil robots.
- Yeah!

242
00:24:54,817 --> 00:24:57,528
- You wanna take the van?
- No, it's beat.

243
00:25:00,197 --> 00:25:01,407
There's a Porsche.

244
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:04,493
Let's bag it.

245
00:25:06,328 --> 00:25:07,830
Station.

246
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:47,369
Bill...

247
00:25:48,912 --> 00:25:50,289
...what happened?

248
00:25:51,957 --> 00:25:52,916
Ted...

249
00:25:54,251 --> 00:25:56,253
...we're dead, dude.

250
00:25:59,465 --> 00:26:03,260
- No way.
- Yes way.

251
00:26:03,469 --> 00:26:04,887
Look.

252
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,312
Now what?

253
00:26:17,232 --> 00:26:18,567
Who's that?

254
00:26:28,994 --> 00:26:30,788
Who are you?

255
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:32,498
Ted...

256
00:26:33,582 --> 00:26:36,210
...it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

257
00:26:39,004 --> 00:26:40,798
How's it hanging, Death?

258
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:44,426
You will come with me.

259
00:26:47,429 --> 00:26:50,641
We can't.
We gotta get back to the babes.

260
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:53,310
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

261
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:57,106
We gotta stop these evil "usses."
We gotta try.

262
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:02,277
Excuse us, dude,
but is there any way back?

263
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:07,699
You may challenge me to a contest.

264
00:27:08,242 --> 00:27:09,910
But if you lose...

265
00:27:10,703 --> 00:27:13,664
...you will remain here
in the afterlife...

266
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:15,624
...forever.

267
00:27:20,295 --> 00:27:22,423
What if we win?

268
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:27,177
No one has ever won.

269
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:31,932
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy.
- Definitely.

270
00:27:32,474 --> 00:27:33,600
But how?

271
00:27:36,311 --> 00:27:38,814
Melvin.

272
00:27:42,151 --> 00:27:44,653
Excuse us, dude...

273
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,489
...but your shoes are untied.

274
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:01,170
I can't believe
we just melvined Death.

275
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:06,467
Let's hope he doesn't
catch up with us.

276
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,176
No way!

277
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,764
This isn't funny.

278
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:55,474
Way to go, Joanna!

279
00:28:55,724 --> 00:28:58,394
I don't understand
what's come over you two.

280
00:28:58,602 --> 00:29:02,523
You see, we used to be puss-weeds,
but now we're metal.

281
00:29:02,731 --> 00:29:05,109
So get over here and put out!

282
00:29:06,735 --> 00:29:09,905
You can forget
about us playing tonight.

283
00:29:10,781 --> 00:29:11,782
Fine.

284
00:29:17,538 --> 00:29:19,790
Then I guess that's that.

285
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,002
Yeah, see you.

286
00:29:36,598 --> 00:29:38,684
Catch you later, babes!

287
00:29:48,193 --> 00:29:50,404
Ted, I have an idea.

288
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:53,490
Tonight after we make
De Nomolos' speech...

289
00:29:54,241 --> 00:29:56,243
...let's waste them.

290
00:29:56,952 --> 00:30:01,248
Station. Meanwhile, let's trash
this lame rathole.

291
00:30:01,457 --> 00:30:02,916
Stellar, Evil Ted!

292
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:14,094
- Ted, we have got to stop them.
- Yeah. But how?

293
00:30:18,474 --> 00:30:19,850
I hope this works.

294
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:23,479
<i>It worked in The Exorcist.</i>
<i>I and III!</i>

295
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:33,781
You'll move downtown so DeLoach
can take her maternity leave.

296
00:30:33,989 --> 00:30:37,242
Also, anyone interested
in moonlighting...

297
00:30:37,451 --> 00:30:40,913
...we're stepping up security
for the Battle of the Bands.

298
00:30:41,121 --> 00:30:44,416
I hear your son's band is playing.

299
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,215
Thanks for reminding me, sergeant.
Also, Scott Frank...

300
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:55,928
- So, how do we do this?
- I don't know.

301
00:30:57,346 --> 00:30:59,390
Why don't you try something?

302
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,725
Okay.

303
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:21,411
Okay, dudes.

304
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:24,456
I mean, fellow policemen...

305
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,668
...my son, Ted "Theodore" Logan...

306
00:31:27,876 --> 00:31:30,462
...and his friend
Bill Preston, Esquire...

307
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:35,134
...have been murdered and replaced
by evil robots from the future.

308
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,052
You totally did it, dude!

309
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:39,179
I totally possessed my dad.

310
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:45,477
Okay.

311
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:51,275
You have to arrest these robots
so they don't ruin everything for us.

312
00:31:51,525 --> 00:31:54,069
I mean, my son and Bill.

313
00:31:54,611 --> 00:31:58,949
And, most importantly,
they don't hurt the babes.

314
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:01,577
The princesses.

315
00:32:04,037 --> 00:32:05,164
This isn't working.

316
00:32:05,372 --> 00:32:08,000
- Back me up, dude.
- You got it, dude.

317
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:22,806
I totally believe you, dude.

318
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:28,771
- Doughnuts!
- Excellent!

319
00:32:28,937 --> 00:32:30,606
Savory cruller.

320
00:32:31,231 --> 00:32:34,735
- I got really hungry being dead.
- Yeah!

321
00:32:36,737 --> 00:32:39,198
I don't think they believe us.

322
00:32:40,157 --> 00:32:43,077
We have to find someone who will.

323
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:46,580
Catch you later, cop dudes!

324
00:32:52,711 --> 00:32:55,923
Ted, we can't go like this.

325
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:09,561
Thanks, Dad.

326
00:33:11,563 --> 00:33:15,317
- Good morning.
- Sergeant.

327
00:33:20,656 --> 00:33:21,865
Gandhi.

328
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,494
Anne Boleyn.

329
00:33:26,495 --> 00:33:28,038
Aristotle.

330
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:31,583
President Chester A. Arthur.

331
00:33:33,043 --> 00:33:34,878
Clark Gable.

332
00:33:35,587 --> 00:33:37,172
Charlemagne.

333
00:33:37,673 --> 00:33:40,592
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

334
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,935
- Has this séance stuff ever worked?
- No.

335
00:33:51,478 --> 00:33:53,772
But it will today, dude.

336
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,450
O great spirits
from the netherworld...

337
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:08,579
...leave your celestial
abode and speak upon us...

338
00:34:08,787 --> 00:34:11,999
...with your life lessons.

339
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:25,012
I feel the spirits have arrived!

340
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:27,097
How's it going...

341
00:34:27,306 --> 00:34:30,184
...New Age dudes?

342
00:34:30,893 --> 00:34:33,896
Spirits, can you hear me?

343
00:34:36,982 --> 00:34:39,276
And we can see down your...

344
00:34:39,485 --> 00:34:42,321
It's your mom, dude!

345
00:34:44,156 --> 00:34:47,326
You're right! Move over, dude.

346
00:34:48,577 --> 00:34:51,789
Spirits, what have you to say to us?

347
00:34:52,956 --> 00:34:56,668
The princesses are in trouble.

348
00:34:57,669 --> 00:35:01,298
Ted and his most
excellent friend Bill...

349
00:35:01,507 --> 00:35:03,258
...were killed!

350
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:08,388
- Listen to us.
- Beware!

351
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:15,312
O evil spirits from Hell...

352
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,690
...I send you back into the darkness!

353
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:26,490
- What's she doing?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

354
00:35:30,077 --> 00:35:31,620
No way!

355
00:36:28,177 --> 00:36:30,971
This is a totally deep hole.

356
00:36:34,224 --> 00:36:37,394
- Now what?
- I don't know.

357
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,704
- You wanna play 20 Questions?
- Okay. I got one.

358
00:36:56,163 --> 00:36:57,706
Are you a mineral?

359
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:02,169
Are you a tank?

360
00:37:03,545 --> 00:37:04,838
Good one!

361
00:37:08,884 --> 00:37:12,054
- Not bad!
- Can we do it again?

362
00:37:13,013 --> 00:37:17,476
I'm working as hard as I can!

363
00:37:17,726 --> 00:37:19,687
No way!

364
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,653
This is not what I expected
this place to look like.

365
00:37:27,945 --> 00:37:31,740
We got totally lied to
by our album covers, man.

366
00:37:44,461 --> 00:37:46,046
Who's that?

367
00:37:46,422 --> 00:37:49,800
Ted, who do you think it is, dude?

368
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:56,640
How do we get his attention?

369
00:37:57,558 --> 00:37:59,309
Sign of the devil, dude!

370
00:37:59,893 --> 00:38:03,772
- Hey, Devil dude!
- Down here!

371
00:38:03,939 --> 00:38:06,191
Down here, dude!

372
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,236
Two little guys!

373
00:38:09,403 --> 00:38:11,488
Big dude! Down here!

374
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:26,086
I kind of like this.

375
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:29,840
Excellent!

376
00:38:31,842 --> 00:38:33,760
Let's get out of here.

377
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,895
Ted, if I die, you can have
my Megadeth collection.

378
00:38:44,062 --> 00:38:46,523
But, dude, we're already dead!

379
00:38:47,816 --> 00:38:51,904
- Well, then they're yours, dude.
- Whoa! Thanks, dude.

380
00:39:12,675 --> 00:39:14,843
How's it going, Beelzebub?

381
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:19,264
Okay. Can we go now?

382
00:39:20,057 --> 00:39:22,559
You may go.

383
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:28,107
Thanks, dude!

384
00:39:28,315 --> 00:39:33,070
You know, you got a bad rap,
but you're actually an okay dude!

385
00:39:46,875 --> 00:39:50,212
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

386
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,842
Maybe we should try
one of these tunnels.

387
00:40:02,725 --> 00:40:05,352
- Where are we?
- I don't know.

388
00:40:06,145 --> 00:40:08,814
Maybe we should try
one of these doors.

389
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:16,238
After you, dude.

390
00:40:24,246 --> 00:40:25,998
Now where are we?

391
00:40:29,251 --> 00:40:30,335
Who's that?

392
00:40:35,132 --> 00:40:36,425
It's Colonel Oats!

393
00:40:37,134 --> 00:40:38,761
No way!

394
00:40:39,136 --> 00:40:40,846
Gentlemen!

395
00:40:42,764 --> 00:40:45,559
Welcome to Hell.

396
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:48,270
- No way.
- What?!

397
00:40:48,437 --> 00:40:50,063
No way, sir?

398
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,066
You two...

399
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:56,779
...will do whatever
I tell you to do...

400
00:40:57,029 --> 00:40:59,907
...from now on.

401
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:02,451
Is that clear?

402
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:06,830
- Yes, sir, dude!
- What?!

403
00:41:07,414 --> 00:41:10,334
- Yes, dude, sir!
- What?!

404
00:41:10,918 --> 00:41:12,753
Yes, sir, sir dude!

405
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,756
Get down and give me...

406
00:41:15,964 --> 00:41:18,133
...infinity.

407
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:25,641
Stupid, pathetic,
craven little cretins.

408
00:41:26,809 --> 00:41:32,105
- I can't possibly do infinity pushups!
- Pitiful little morons.

409
00:41:32,439 --> 00:41:35,025
- Maybe we can do girls' style.
- Jokers!

410
00:41:35,234 --> 00:41:39,697
You petty, base, bully,
bullock, bugger billies.

411
00:41:39,863 --> 00:41:43,659
You're not strong! You're silky boys!

412
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:48,330
Silk comes from the butts
of Chinese worms.

413
00:41:48,497 --> 00:41:53,752
- We gotta get out of here.
- I'll eat you up like butter cakes.

414
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:56,380
Get back here!

415
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:01,927
- Dude.
- What?

416
00:42:02,177 --> 00:42:04,888
I think we're in
our own personal hell.

417
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:09,184
- Let's split up.
- That way he can't get us so bad.

418
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,540
What happened?

419
00:42:58,484 --> 00:43:00,319
Bogus!

420
00:43:27,679 --> 00:43:32,351
Granny S. Preston, Esquire.

421
00:43:32,601 --> 00:43:34,061
No way.

422
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,489
Theodore!

423
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:49,493
You made your brother cry.

424
00:43:50,244 --> 00:43:51,662
How about...

425
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,706
...a kiss...

426
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:58,836
...for your dear old granny, Bill?

427
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,135
Come along.

428
00:44:14,977 --> 00:44:17,813
You stole Deacon's Easter basket.

429
00:44:18,021 --> 00:44:21,525
No way. This was 10 years ago!

430
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,410
Come here!

431
00:44:36,165 --> 00:44:40,043
That was non, non, non...
Non-heinous!

432
00:44:40,252 --> 00:44:41,587
Choose...

433
00:44:41,795 --> 00:44:43,047
...your...

434
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:45,341
...eternity.

435
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:52,055
Choose your own, you fag!

436
00:45:00,856 --> 00:45:05,694
You ugly, red source of all evil!

437
00:45:12,659 --> 00:45:15,371
Hello, girls.

438
00:45:25,005 --> 00:45:26,173
- Dude.
- What?

439
00:45:26,298 --> 00:45:28,509
- Hell sucks!
- Definitely!

440
00:45:28,717 --> 00:45:33,430
- You no-nosed salamanders!
- Deac's Easter basket!

441
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,435
Come to Oatsie!

442
00:45:42,898 --> 00:45:45,067
I want one right on the lips!

443
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:51,657
- There's only one way out!
- Right. We gotta play the Reaper!

444
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,916
Choose your game.

445
00:46:01,416 --> 00:46:03,669
But if you lose...

446
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:06,588
...you will stay here in Hell...

447
00:46:07,381 --> 00:46:09,133
...forever.

448
00:46:25,941 --> 00:46:28,319
D-1.

449
00:46:32,948 --> 00:46:33,949
Miss.

450
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:44,460
B...

451
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,878
...3.

452
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:49,006
Miss.

453
00:46:50,758 --> 00:46:53,385
C-6.

454
00:46:57,806 --> 00:46:58,974
Hit.

455
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:05,647
- Dude...
- I know.

456
00:47:12,446 --> 00:47:14,781
J-7.

457
00:47:15,866 --> 00:47:17,951
J-7...

458
00:47:19,536 --> 00:47:20,537
Hit.

459
00:47:22,331 --> 00:47:26,335
A hit. You have sunk my battleship.

460
00:47:27,044 --> 00:47:28,086
Excellent!

461
00:47:30,506 --> 00:47:33,676
- I knew he put it in the J's.
- Good thinking.

462
00:47:33,884 --> 00:47:35,886
You must play me again.

463
00:47:36,512 --> 00:47:40,557
- What?!
- Best two out of three.

464
00:47:40,766 --> 00:47:41,975
No way!

465
00:47:45,854 --> 00:47:47,731
Yes way.

466
00:47:56,323 --> 00:47:58,450
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

467
00:48:09,169 --> 00:48:11,296
I believe...

468
00:48:11,463 --> 00:48:15,592
...Col. Mustard did it
in the study with the candlestick.

469
00:48:23,892 --> 00:48:27,146
Sorry, Death. You lose.
It was Professor Plum.

470
00:48:27,354 --> 00:48:31,358
- I said "Plum."
- No way. You said "Mustard!"

471
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:32,901
Can we go back now?

472
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,947
Best three out of five.

473
00:48:38,073 --> 00:48:40,367
I don't believe this guy.

474
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:54,798
- Best of seven?
- Damn right!

475
00:48:59,678 --> 00:49:01,680
Right hand, green.

476
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,604
Left hand, red.

477
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:15,110
Right foot, green.

478
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,238
Right foot...

479
00:49:43,597 --> 00:49:44,765
Well?

480
00:49:49,937 --> 00:49:51,355
I will...

481
00:49:53,232 --> 00:49:54,817
...take you back.

482
00:50:02,074 --> 00:50:06,829
- You played very well.
- Especially with your heavy robes.

483
00:50:07,037 --> 00:50:08,831
Don't patronize me.

484
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:13,293
Whatever. You got a lot
to learn about sportsmanship.

485
00:50:14,419 --> 00:50:15,921
This way.

486
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,924
Now we can save the babes.

487
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:23,178
But, Bill, how will we fight
those other usses?

488
00:50:23,387 --> 00:50:27,432
They're totally stronger than us.
And way smarter.

489
00:50:27,641 --> 00:50:30,561
Plus, they already killed us once.

490
00:50:32,062 --> 00:50:33,856
One minute, duder!

491
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:39,528
If we were good human usses and we had
to fight two evil robot usses...

492
00:50:39,737 --> 00:50:43,282
...what would we do?
- Make good robot usses?

493
00:50:43,490 --> 00:50:45,993
Good thinking, dude!

494
00:50:46,368 --> 00:50:47,411
Excuse us.

495
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:50,456
- Excuse me, Death?
- Oh, now what?

496
00:50:50,622 --> 00:50:53,959
Could you take us to someone
who could help us?

497
00:50:54,168 --> 00:50:57,588
You have beaten me.
I am at your command.

498
00:50:57,838 --> 00:50:59,089
Cool!

499
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:00,924
This way.

500
00:51:02,468 --> 00:51:04,219
- Ted.
- What?

501
00:51:04,428 --> 00:51:06,430
Don't fear the Reaper.

502
00:51:07,473 --> 00:51:09,475
I heard that.

503
00:51:21,987 --> 00:51:24,823
This is most atypical.

504
00:51:49,348 --> 00:51:51,016
Welcome to Heaven.

505
00:51:53,268 --> 00:51:55,229
I'm sure I'll enjoy it.

506
00:51:55,896 --> 00:51:57,189
Thank you.

507
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:00,567
Through there.

508
00:52:00,776 --> 00:52:02,403
Welcome to Heaven.

509
00:52:03,612 --> 00:52:05,656
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

510
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:11,578
"Only the most serene and enlightened
souls shall gain audience."

511
00:52:11,787 --> 00:52:13,831
Dude, we're in big trouble.

512
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:18,335
I think I have an idea.

513
00:52:27,302 --> 00:52:29,012
Wise dudes.

514
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,390
Can we ask you a question?

515
00:52:31,974 --> 00:52:33,809
Right this way, please.

516
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:48,198
We're in Heaven,
and we just mugged three people.

517
00:52:48,407 --> 00:52:51,660
We better leave
before we ruin it for everybody.

518
00:52:54,621 --> 00:52:56,498
Come on, Death.

519
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,376
You look great, dude.

520
00:53:00,669 --> 00:53:02,254
You think so?

521
00:53:07,259 --> 00:53:08,761
You do.

522
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,348
Shut up.

523
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:16,935
- Come on, dude.
- It's not funny.

524
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:20,105
I can't believe I'm doing this.

525
00:53:20,314 --> 00:53:23,317
How did I end up in this situation?

526
00:53:42,961 --> 00:53:44,171
How's it going?

527
00:53:45,797 --> 00:53:47,800
What is the meaning of life?

528
00:53:57,935 --> 00:54:02,022
<i>Every rose has its thorn</i>

529
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:06,360
<i>Just like every night has its dawn</i>

530
00:54:06,568 --> 00:54:09,571
<i>Just like every cowboy</i>

531
00:54:09,738 --> 00:54:13,992
<i>Sings a sad, sad song</i>

532
00:54:18,997 --> 00:54:22,209
<i>Every rose has a thorn</i>

533
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,088
Don't I know you?

534
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,049
No.

535
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:14,928
So, God, as if you didn't know...

536
00:55:15,512 --> 00:55:20,100
...we're not the three wise people
you might have thought we were.

537
00:55:20,309 --> 00:55:24,688
We mugged three people and took
their clothes. Sorry.

538
00:55:24,896 --> 00:55:28,525
- I'm Bill S. Preston.
- I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan.

539
00:55:28,734 --> 00:55:33,405
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

540
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,868
This lovely lady is the Grim Reaper.

541
00:55:38,077 --> 00:55:41,330
He brought us when we
challenged him and won.

542
00:55:43,707 --> 00:55:48,754
First, congratulations on Earth!
It's a most excellent planet.

543
00:55:48,962 --> 00:55:53,842
- We enjoy it on a daily basis.
- Not to mention your other planets.

544
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:58,013
Mars, Jupiter, Uranus.

545
00:56:00,474 --> 00:56:04,103
But the point is, we died.

546
00:56:04,311 --> 00:56:06,772
Most unfairly.

547
00:56:07,356 --> 00:56:09,983
But we won the chance to come back.

548
00:56:10,192 --> 00:56:14,029
We gotta construct something
to save the women we love.

549
00:56:14,696 --> 00:56:18,242
And there's not a lot of time.
So we were wondering...

550
00:56:18,492 --> 00:56:21,954
...could you help us
find somebody to help us?

551
00:56:22,705 --> 00:56:25,124
<i>Station.</i>

552
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:28,252
We were thinking along the lines...

553
00:56:28,419 --> 00:56:31,713
...of maybe a scientist or something.

554
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:46,604
Cool.

555
00:56:49,856 --> 00:56:51,650
Thanks, God.

556
00:56:51,942 --> 00:56:55,779
Yeah. You're a just and noble creator.

557
00:56:57,114 --> 00:57:00,659
- We'll be going now.
- Keep up the good work.

558
00:57:00,868 --> 00:57:02,911
Catch you later, God.

559
00:57:13,213 --> 00:57:17,051
Sorry. They melvined me.

560
00:57:22,890 --> 00:57:25,934
All right, upside-down cake!

561
00:57:26,101 --> 00:57:28,896
- Hey, Evil Ted.
- What?

562
00:57:34,151 --> 00:57:35,945
We're out of dishes.

563
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:39,406
Check this out.

564
00:57:42,784 --> 00:57:45,329
Not bad, E.T.

565
00:57:47,498 --> 00:57:48,749
Let me try.

566
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:58,217
You totally didn't see the fan.

567
00:58:03,305 --> 00:58:06,558
Tell my body to get over here
and get me!

568
00:58:07,017 --> 00:58:09,937
That's all right. I'll get you.

569
00:58:11,521 --> 00:58:13,982
Got your head, dude.

570
00:58:16,777 --> 00:58:19,530
I'm totally gonna tackle you, dude.

571
00:58:22,825 --> 00:58:27,663
- Touchdown for Evil Ted!
- We're total headbangers.

572
00:58:30,916 --> 00:58:34,253
Come on. There you go.

573
00:58:40,175 --> 00:58:44,096
Stop wasting time.
Proceed with the plan now.

574
00:58:44,346 --> 00:58:46,056
<i>Okay, dude.</i>

575
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:50,394
<i>What do you say</i>
<i>we trash their relationships?</i>

576
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:54,648
I hate them.

577
00:58:54,857 --> 00:58:58,027
I hate the robot versions of them.

578
00:58:58,485 --> 00:59:00,404
<i>You made us, dude.</i>

579
00:59:07,536 --> 00:59:09,913
Looks like this is the place.

580
00:59:10,164 --> 00:59:13,041
Now all we gotta do
is find that scientist.

581
00:59:14,126 --> 00:59:17,671
- What kind of name is Station?
- I don't know.

582
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,257
Must be some kind of future guy.

583
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,931
Okay, how many syllables?

584
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:32,394
Is it a play or a song or...?

585
00:59:34,646 --> 00:59:36,064
It's something big.

586
00:59:37,691 --> 00:59:39,943
My money's on Einstein.

587
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:44,239
That's Station?

588
00:59:45,073 --> 00:59:48,410
Did you assume
the most brilliant scientist...

589
00:59:48,577 --> 00:59:52,372
...in the universe
would be from Earth?

590
00:59:53,457 --> 00:59:54,875
Yeah.

591
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:01,465
Movies?

592
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:04,802
- Nine words.
- Good, Mr. Franklin.

593
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:07,346
Fire? Cigarettes?

594
01:00:07,554 --> 01:00:10,182
- Clouds, clouds.
- Smoke?

595
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:14,561
<i>Butch and Sundance: The Early Years.</i>

596
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:23,821
- Death!
- Sorry.

597
01:00:27,157 --> 01:00:30,160
<i>Smokey and the Bandit III.</i>

598
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:33,205
Smokey is the bandit!

599
01:00:42,589 --> 01:00:45,426
Excuse us. Martians?

600
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:49,471
First, my friend,
Bill and I congratulate you...

601
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:52,766
...on a well-played round of charades.

602
01:00:52,975 --> 01:00:55,227
You've been referred to us...

603
01:00:55,436 --> 01:00:59,273
...as the most brilliant scientists
in the universe.

604
01:01:00,899 --> 01:01:03,902
Would you help us build
good robot usses...

605
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:07,990
...to save two princesses
from bad robot usses?

606
01:01:17,416 --> 01:01:19,668
Sounds good, Station.

607
01:01:23,338 --> 01:01:25,174
Let's rock, Death.

608
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:56,330
- We're alive.
- Yeah.

609
01:01:56,497 --> 01:02:01,001
But I think a buzzard
was pecking at my head.

610
01:02:06,673 --> 01:02:09,134
Dinner's over, worm-dude.

611
01:02:12,846 --> 01:02:14,640
You guys okay?

612
01:02:16,141 --> 01:02:18,018
Where's Death?

613
01:02:27,111 --> 01:02:28,529
You okay, dude?

614
01:02:32,282 --> 01:02:34,284
I'm fine.

615
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:44,711
First, we go back to town
and clean up.

616
01:02:44,920 --> 01:02:47,256
Second, we warn the princesses.

617
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:51,343
Third, we buy stuff
to build good robot usses.

618
01:02:53,345 --> 01:02:55,055
Let's go.

619
01:02:58,100 --> 01:03:00,269
What? What?

620
01:03:15,033 --> 01:03:18,579
Here, kitty, kitty!
Here, kitty, kitty!

621
01:03:18,829 --> 01:03:20,497
There's one, dude!

622
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:24,251
Just missed, dude.

623
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:27,421
Dude, we're there.

624
01:03:27,629 --> 01:03:29,339
Okay. I got an idea.

625
01:03:50,778 --> 01:03:53,113
How's it going, lady humans?

626
01:04:21,850 --> 01:04:24,937
Okay, this is Builders Emporium...

627
01:04:25,104 --> 01:04:29,024
...a repository for electronics
and robot materials.

628
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:32,736
Get what you need to make metal usses.

629
01:04:36,531 --> 01:04:40,702
- Ready for the big night?
- No! We're not going.

630
01:04:43,414 --> 01:04:46,500
I think you guys
should stop right there.

631
01:04:47,626 --> 01:04:50,003
Catch you later, future wife.

632
01:04:52,381 --> 01:04:54,007
Evil breath!

633
01:04:54,299 --> 01:04:55,300
Who are you?

634
01:04:55,509 --> 01:04:57,636
Well, you see...

635
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:11,024
Come on.

636
01:05:12,943 --> 01:05:16,697
- Any luck?
- They're not at our place or theirs.

637
01:05:16,864 --> 01:05:21,368
I'll try your dad's.
Maybe they went to talk to Missy.

638
01:05:30,335 --> 01:05:31,837
Logan residence.

639
01:05:32,045 --> 01:05:35,382
Evil Bill S. Preston,
Esquire, speaking.

640
01:05:37,968 --> 01:05:41,388
It's them! They're back from the dead.

641
01:05:41,597 --> 01:05:43,807
We get to kill them again.

642
01:05:44,016 --> 01:05:45,267
Excellent!

643
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:03,494
See you real soon.

644
01:06:07,373 --> 01:06:10,667
- But this time we're ready for you!
- Yeah!

645
01:06:14,296 --> 01:06:16,757
We can be ready for them too.

646
01:06:16,965 --> 01:06:20,010
Good luck getting
in the concert, losers!

647
01:06:26,684 --> 01:06:30,354
<i>- Initiate the final plan.</i>
<i>- You got it, great one.</i>

648
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,441
<i>Do not fail me.</i>

649
01:06:35,442 --> 01:06:37,069
<i>Metallic buffoons.</i>

650
01:06:43,117 --> 01:06:46,286
- That other me is a dick.
- Yeah.

651
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:51,333
I hope the Stations
know what they're doing.

652
01:07:10,811 --> 01:07:13,272
Station! What are you doing?

653
01:07:15,441 --> 01:07:19,278
Dudes! This is no time
to be playing games!

654
01:09:39,334 --> 01:09:41,378
That one's me, right?

655
01:09:44,756 --> 01:09:46,508
Not bad.

656
01:09:46,717 --> 01:09:49,261
How's it going, Good Robot Bill?

657
01:09:50,137 --> 01:09:51,972
How's it doing?

658
01:10:03,942 --> 01:10:05,819
<i>Kate Axelrod for KJM...</i>

659
01:10:06,028 --> 01:10:09,948
<i>... reporting live from</i>
<i>the San Dimas Auditorium.</i>

660
01:10:10,157 --> 01:10:13,243
<i>We're rocking at</i>
<i>the Battle of the Bands.</i>

661
01:10:13,452 --> 01:10:16,872
<i>So stay tuned and hold tight</i>
<i>until we find out...</i>

662
01:10:17,123 --> 01:10:20,333
<i>... who will be your winner.</i>

663
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:31,804
Ready? You're up.

664
01:10:32,012 --> 01:10:33,430
Where are the girls?

665
01:10:33,639 --> 01:10:38,018
- Hanging from the rafters.
- We'll kill them at the finale.

666
01:10:38,852 --> 01:10:40,854
Good luck, gentlemen.

667
01:10:47,569 --> 01:10:49,071
Check it out.

668
01:10:51,156 --> 01:10:52,533
Not bad.

669
01:11:18,142 --> 01:11:21,479
Let's hear it for Primus!

670
01:11:59,141 --> 01:12:01,769
- Are they ready?
- Station.

671
01:12:01,935 --> 01:12:03,812
Excellent work, dude.

672
01:12:03,979 --> 01:12:08,066
- What about me? I made the wigs.
- Okay, Death.

673
01:12:08,317 --> 01:12:11,612
I helped do the shopping.
I pushed the cart.

674
01:12:11,737 --> 01:12:15,032
- Do they work like we asked?
- Station.

675
01:12:18,452 --> 01:12:21,580
You're a most excellent scientist.

676
01:12:22,289 --> 01:12:25,876
Plus, you got an excellently huge
Martian butt.

677
01:12:31,381 --> 01:12:34,968
Feel free to split
in two parts again and relax.

678
01:12:35,135 --> 01:12:39,473
Don't overlook my butt.
I work out all the time.

679
01:12:39,682 --> 01:12:42,768
And reaping burns a lot of calories.

680
01:12:47,314 --> 01:12:52,277
Ready to take on those evil usses
and save the babes?

681
01:12:53,904 --> 01:12:57,908
<i>Fight evil usses. Save the babes.</i>

682
01:12:58,075 --> 01:13:00,869
- Ready, Bill?
- Ready, Ted.

683
01:13:02,121 --> 01:13:03,997
Let's go get 'em.

684
01:13:04,206 --> 01:13:06,959
And now, the last band of the evening.

685
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:09,920
Wyld Stallyns!

686
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,017
How's it going, worms?

687
01:13:23,517 --> 01:13:26,228
I'm Bill S. Preston, Esquire!

688
01:13:26,478 --> 01:13:29,106
And I'm Ted "Theodore" Logan!

689
01:13:29,314 --> 01:13:34,069
Together, we are Wyld Stallyns!

690
01:13:35,613 --> 01:13:37,739
Hold it right there!

691
01:13:40,867 --> 01:13:43,120
We're Wyld Stallyns!

692
01:13:43,370 --> 01:13:47,249
No, dudes. We're Wyld Stallyns!

693
01:13:49,876 --> 01:13:53,922
You totally killed us,
you evil metal dickweeds!

694
01:13:54,172 --> 01:13:56,758
Yeah, and we're gonna do it again!

695
01:13:56,967 --> 01:14:00,762
Plus, we're gonna totally
kill your girlfriends.

696
01:14:08,896 --> 01:14:12,315
Don't worry, babes! We'll save you.

697
01:14:14,985 --> 01:14:18,530
Everybody, say hello
to Station's creation!

698
01:14:18,822 --> 01:14:21,784
Good Robot Bill and Ted!

699
01:14:35,255 --> 01:14:37,299
We may have met our match.

700
01:14:37,591 --> 01:14:40,678
Kudos to you, good human usses.

701
01:14:42,513 --> 01:14:46,976
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!
- Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

702
01:15:23,345 --> 01:15:25,639
- Elizabeth!
- Theodore!

703
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:29,018
- Joanna!
- William!

704
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,824
Who is that?

705
01:16:01,425 --> 01:16:02,509
Who are you?

706
01:16:03,677 --> 01:16:05,387
Who am I?

707
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:15,022
I am De Nomolos.

708
01:16:16,064 --> 01:16:18,025
I am their master.

709
01:16:19,610 --> 01:16:23,030
And I must see to it that you die.

710
01:16:25,741 --> 01:16:27,451
But first...

711
01:16:52,851 --> 01:16:57,939
<i>We are now transmitting on every</i>
<i>channel throughout the world.</i>

712
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:00,359
My word!

713
01:17:04,863 --> 01:17:08,075
<i>I want the whole universe</i>
<i>to behold this...</i>

714
01:17:08,284 --> 01:17:10,953
<i>... transfer of power.</i>

715
01:17:12,371 --> 01:17:15,416
<i>No longer will our future society...</i>

716
01:17:15,624 --> 01:17:18,793
<i>... be based on</i>
<i>the ideas and the music...</i>

717
01:17:19,044 --> 01:17:21,546
<i>... of these two fools!</i>

718
01:17:24,091 --> 01:17:27,094
<i>They will be based on my ideas...</i>

719
01:17:29,054 --> 01:17:31,515
...and my ideas alone!

720
01:17:32,891 --> 01:17:35,895
How do we get out of this?
There's no time.

721
01:17:36,019 --> 01:17:39,815
We do. After we get away
from this guy...

722
01:17:39,982 --> 01:17:45,070
...we time-travel back and set up
the things we need to get him now.

723
01:17:45,279 --> 01:17:47,197
Yeah, like what?

724
01:17:47,823 --> 01:17:49,867
Like a sandbag.

725
01:17:55,748 --> 01:17:57,082
Excellent!

726
01:17:57,291 --> 01:17:59,418
Then we'll get a cage.

727
01:18:06,883 --> 01:18:08,468
My friends.

728
01:18:09,136 --> 01:18:11,555
I too can play the time game.

729
01:18:11,764 --> 01:18:15,059
If you do that,
once I have vanquished you...

730
01:18:15,309 --> 01:18:19,354
...I'll go back and set up this key.

731
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:32,576
And another gun.

732
01:18:42,335 --> 01:18:46,256
Right. Only there's one thing
you didn't think of.

733
01:18:46,465 --> 01:18:49,635
Only the winners can go back
and set things up.

734
01:18:49,843 --> 01:18:51,845
And that's gonna be us.

735
01:18:52,054 --> 01:18:56,100
We set up the key,
and we set up the gun.

736
01:18:58,686 --> 01:19:00,687
Excuse me.

737
01:19:00,896 --> 01:19:03,857
Your shoelaces are untied.

738
01:19:10,656 --> 01:19:11,948
Melvined.

739
01:19:25,879 --> 01:19:27,423
You're under arrest.

740
01:19:27,589 --> 01:19:29,341
Way to go, Dad!

741
01:19:34,179 --> 01:19:36,056
Book him, Danno.

742
01:19:43,063 --> 01:19:44,690
Good job, Death.

743
01:19:49,945 --> 01:19:51,697
Who was that guy?

744
01:19:51,864 --> 01:19:54,992
I can answer that question.

745
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:57,620
Ms. Wardroe, thanks for the help.

746
01:19:58,287 --> 01:20:00,331
We definitely...

747
01:20:01,039 --> 01:20:03,041
Take it off, baby!

748
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:13,093
Rufus!

749
01:20:13,302 --> 01:20:14,636
When did you get here?

750
01:20:14,970 --> 01:20:17,181
Just in time for your audition.

751
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:20,851
So you were Ms. Wardroe all along.

752
01:20:21,769 --> 01:20:24,730
Would anyone else have let you
in this contest?

753
01:20:28,734 --> 01:20:32,029
That was Chuck De Nomolos,
my old gym teacher.

754
01:20:32,196 --> 01:20:36,700
And, by the way, sit-up champion
of the 27th century.

755
01:20:36,908 --> 01:20:41,413
And now, gentlemen, I believe
the stage belongs to you.

756
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:42,998
Thanks, Rufus.

757
01:20:56,136 --> 01:20:58,722
<i>Dude, we still don't know how to play.</i>

758
01:20:59,223 --> 01:21:01,392
Maybe we ought to get good.

759
01:21:01,642 --> 01:21:02,852
How?

760
01:21:25,124 --> 01:21:29,294
That was a fast 16 months
of intensive guitar training.

761
01:21:30,504 --> 01:21:33,716
Except for the two-week
medieval honeymoon.

762
01:21:35,676 --> 01:21:38,137
Hello, San Dimas!

763
01:21:39,430 --> 01:21:41,807
Let me introduce you
to a little friend.

764
01:21:42,099 --> 01:21:43,767
This is little Ted.

765
01:21:44,309 --> 01:21:46,729
Hello, little Ted!

766
01:21:46,937 --> 01:21:48,814
This is little Bill.

767
01:21:52,359 --> 01:21:55,529
Now for the rest of our band.

768
01:21:58,741 --> 01:22:03,537
On conga and bongos, proof that
you can't tell a book by its cover...

769
01:22:03,746 --> 01:22:06,457
...the dude who can make one word
mean anything...

770
01:22:06,665 --> 01:22:08,584
...Station!

771
01:22:13,672 --> 01:22:15,257
Our backup dancers...

772
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,135
...Station's most bodacious
creations...

773
01:22:18,302 --> 01:22:21,138
...the Good Robot Usses!

774
01:22:27,519 --> 01:22:28,687
And over here...

775
01:22:28,896 --> 01:22:31,857
...our bass player,
the Duke of Spooks...

776
01:22:32,065 --> 01:22:34,818
...the Doc of Shocks,
the Man With No Tan...

777
01:22:35,027 --> 01:22:37,863
...please say hello
to Death himself...

778
01:22:38,113 --> 01:22:39,907
...the Grim Reaper!

779
01:22:47,707 --> 01:22:50,334
<i>You might be a king</i>
<i>Or a little street sweeper</i>

780
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,921
<i>But sooner or later</i>
<i>You dance with the Reaper</i>

781
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,428
Get down with your bad self!

782
01:23:08,018 --> 01:23:10,687
I love show business.

783
01:23:11,897 --> 01:23:13,690
Ladies and gentlemen...

784
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:16,402
...we've been to the past.

785
01:23:16,777 --> 01:23:18,612
We've been to the future.

786
01:23:19,029 --> 01:23:21,448
We've been all around the afterlife.

787
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:23,450
And you know...

788
01:23:25,536 --> 01:23:27,538
The best place to be...

789
01:23:30,458 --> 01:23:31,833
...is here.

790
01:23:32,876 --> 01:23:34,836
And the best time to be...

791
01:23:35,295 --> 01:23:36,755
...is now.

792
01:23:42,594 --> 01:23:45,347
And all we can say is...

793
01:23:47,307 --> 01:23:48,559
...let's rock!

794
01:23:49,769 --> 01:23:51,312
One! Two!

795
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:54,273
One, two, three, four!

796
01:25:18,690 --> 01:25:21,527
Right good! Right good!

797
01:27:54,054 --> 01:27:56,056
<i>You are go, Stallyn!</i>

798
01:27:57,057 --> 01:27:59,351
<i>Come home soon. We'll miss you.</i>
