-準備好了嗎  姑娘們  -當然
- Shall we, ladies? - Great, sure.

145
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,000
{\an8}懷爾德-史泰林

146
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,930
{\an8}521歲生日快樂

147
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,500
{\an8}521歲生日快樂

148
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,990
我聽說你倆今晚有別的事要慶祝
I understand you two have something eIse to celebrate tonight.

149
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,490
我們要參加樂隊大戰了
We got into the Battle of the Bands.

150
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,410
如果我們贏了  我就還清向你借的錢
If we win, I'll totally pay you back your money.

151
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,890
那如果你們沒贏呢
What if you don't win?

152
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:25,980
那樣的話  我猜
Well, uh, I guess...

153
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,590
可能再去賣點血
Maybe sell more blood.

154
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,810
不如你考慮賣掉幾樣樂器吧
Perhaps you should think about selling a couple of instruments.

155
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,260
我們永遠都為你留了位置  泰德
Of course, we've always got a spot for you, Ted.

156
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,370
還記得我的老朋友
Remember my old friend,

157
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,760
來自阿拉斯加軍校的奧茨上校
Colonel Oats from the Alaskan Military School?

158
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,020
-是要問我近來如何嗎  泰德  -是的
- "How's it going", Ted? - Yeah.

159
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,360
非常棒
Splendidly.

160
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,060
記住
Remember...

161
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,280
泰德  對你而言還不算太晚
...it's not too late for you, Ted.

162
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,050
也對你們倆都是
For either of you.

163
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,420
對你們四個而言都不算晚
For all four of you.

164
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:18,960
有剛做好的軟糖呢
Fresh fudge.

165
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,760
你好  小奧
Hi, Oatsie.

166
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,770
親愛的
Darling.

167
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,880
-你們好啊  -你好  米茜
- Hi, guys. - Hi, Missy.

168
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,340
你好  米茜  我是說媽
Hey, Missy. I mean, Mom.

169
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,680
我簡直不敢相信米茜和你爸離婚
I can't believe Missy divorced your dad...

170
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,360
然后嫁給了我爸
...and married mine.

171
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,270
泰德  閉嘴
Shut up, Ted.

172
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,700
-你爸看上去很糟  -我知道
- Your dad looks bad. - I know.

173
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,700
然后呢
What's next?

174
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:00,840
-可能她會嫁給你  -那你就是你自己的繼父
- Maybe she'll marry you. - Yeah, then you'll be your own stepdad.

175
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,760
你們可能注意到我們還沒給你們禮物
You probably noticed we haven't given you our gifts yet.

176
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,730
那是因為
That's because...

177
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,530
那是因為我們想說
That's because we wanted to say was...

178
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,690
老弟  失陪
Excuse us, dude.

179
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:41,700
我自己寫的
I wrote this myseIf.

180
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,820
我昨晚寫的
I wrote this last night.

181
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:50,620
"伊麗莎白
"Elizabeth..."

182
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,910
"喬安娜
"Joanna...

183
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:57,110
我獨自走過這黑暗的生命之林
as I wander through this dark and Ionely forest of life...

184
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,390
林中猛獸迭出
...surrounded by various beasts...

185
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,470
有熊  毒蛇  還有松鼠"
...bears, vipers, squirreIs..."

186
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,320
"更別提那藤壺和海藻"
"Not to mention barnacles and algae..."

187
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:09,650
"僧帽水母  海星  河豚  還有鯰魚"
"...man-of-wars, starfish, blowfish, catfish..."

188
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,930
錯了  鯰魚是淡水生物
Oh, no, that's freshwater.

189
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:17,270
重點是  我知道我們向你承諾過更好的生活
The point is, I know we promised you a better life than this.

190
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,950
我想說的是
What I mean to say is,

191
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,330
我意識到  我們將你們從英國帶走時
I realize when we took you out of England...

192
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,400
說過未來可期
we said the future held some really good stuff.

193
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,340
雖然未來并沒有我們所期待的那樣美好
Although stuff hasn't worked out how we thought...

194
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:34,020
不過我們希望  總有一天能變好
it will, we hope.

195
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:38,350
后天  如果一切如我們所愿
The day after tomorrow, if things work out...

196
00:14:38,770 --> 00:14:40,400
我想說的是...
What this is about is...

197
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,480
-你們愿意...  -嫁給我們嗎
- Will you...? - Marry us?

198
00:14:57,810 --> 00:14:59,590
-西奧多...  -我愿意
- Theodore... - I'd love to.

199
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,420
對準那只貓  老兄  對準那只貓
Aim for the cat, dude, aim for the cat!

200
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,620
我在努力了  邪惡泰德  很努力了
I'm trying, Evil Ted! I'm trying!

201
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,320
就差一點
Aw, just missed!

202
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,730
-不算糟嘛  -的確  我們開始破壞吧
- Not bad. - Yeah, let's make it bad.

203
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,920
老兄  我們到了
We're here, dude.

204
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:21,470
魯弗斯和你們在一起嗎
Is Rufus with you?

205
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:23,840
稍等
One second.

206
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,480
哥們  我們好像在時光電路里把他甩掉了
Looks like we lost him in the circuits of time, duder.

207
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,890
好極了  那他就永遠消失了
Good. Then he's gone forever.

208
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,120
我們計劃的第一步
Our first act of business:

209
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
毀了那只可笑又乏味的樂隊
Destroy that ridiculous, insipid band!

210
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,390
沒問題  老兄
You got it, dude!

211
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,630
開工吧
Get to work.

212
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,570
好了
Now!

213
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,530
好好研究這些書
Study these books well.

214
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:02,460
我的任務完成之時
When my mission is completed...

215
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,300
這會成為新的歷史
this will be the new history.

216
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,260
真是個傻帽
What a shithead.

217
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:15,350
-拜  -拜
- Bye! - Bye!

218
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:17,730
開車當心
Drive safe!

219
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,500
-老兄  -干嘛
- Dude. - What?

220
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:24,300
你說我們結婚后  公主會留在我們身邊嗎
I wonder if after we're married, princesses will stay over with us?

221
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,740
-當然  -我們的女朋友最潔身自好了
- Yeah. - Our girIfriends are most chaste.

222
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,490
-至少她們沒和我們老爸約會  -說得對  老兄
- At least they're not dating our dads. - Good point, dude.

223
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:39,490
-誰啊  -你好  比爾  我是喬安娜
- Hello? - Hello, Bill. This is Joanna.

224
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,710
喬安娜  你怎么這么快就打來了
Hey Joanna! How'd you call so fast?

225
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,020
這不重要  重要的是
It's not important. This is:

226
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,480
伊麗莎白和我聊過了
Elizabeth and I have spoken and

227
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,470
我們決定要退出懷爾德-史泰林
we've decided we're quitting Wyld Stallyns.

228
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,470
什么
What?

229
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,030
-沒錯  -為什么
- Yes! - Why?

230
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,370
我們覺得你們是廢柴
We think you're losers

231
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,130
再也不想見到你們了
and we don't want to see you again.

232
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,240
不是吧
No way!

233
00:17:56,430 --> 00:17:58,550
我們要獨自前往沙漠
We're going to the desert to be alone.

234
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,540
-可是  -結束了  再也不見
- But - It's over. Goodbye.

235
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,700
徹底騙到那倆傻冒了
I totally fooled thoes other usses.

236
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,080
是啊  他們真棒
Yeah, they're completely brilliant.

237
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,540
才怪
Not!

238
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,860
-我們離開這里進入第二階段吧  -基站
- Let's ditch the booth and start phase two. - Station.

239
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:50,010
這些寶石價值連城
An incredible fortune in stones.

240
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,040
可我愿意用所有寶石換取一把手持移相器
Yet I'd trade them all for a hand phaser.

241
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,140
或一個美味的俱樂部三明治
Or a good solid club.

242
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:02,300
也許我們該早點向她們求婚
Maybe we should've proposed to them sooner.

243
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,340
怎么可能  泰德
How could we, Ted?

244
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,600
我們連自己的公寓都快供不起了
We could barely afford our own apartment.

245
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,570
這真是最最可悲的事
This is most non-non-heinous.

246
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,950
-我們該怎么辦  -我們得找到她們
- What are we gonna do? - We gotta find them.

247
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,470
和她們談談
Talk to them.

248
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,370
怎么找
But how?

249
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,260
會是誰呢
Wonder who that could be?

250
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:52,420
怎么樣啊  比爾和泰德
How's it going, Bill and Ted?

251
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,150
泰德  我們又來了
Ted, it's us again.

252
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,520
-比爾  最近如何  -還不錯  比爾  你呢
- How's it going, Bill? - Not bad, Bill. And you?

253
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:00,820
糟透了
Bad.

254
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:07,060
我們是來解救你們脫離苦海的
We came to help you guys in your most unfortunate situation.

255
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,670
怎么解救
How?

256
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,970
跟我們走  就知道了
Come with us. We'll show you.

257
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,650
好吧
Ok.

258
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,000
失陪  老兄
Excuse us. Dude.

259
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,050
-我有種不祥的預感  -為什么
- I got a weird feeling here. - Why?

260
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,920
說不上來
I don't know.

261
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,290
我們怎么確定他們真的是我們
How do we know these guys are really us?

262
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,150
泰德  我們已經經歷過一次了
Ted, we've been through this before.

263
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:43,160
要不是之前我們自己的干預
If it wasn't for the previous intervention of our future selves...

264
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,150
我們可能穿越歷史嗎  可能遇到摯愛嗎
would we've even passed history? Or met the babes?

265
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,040
可能經歷史上最勁爆的歷險嗎
Or had a most excellent adventure through time?

266
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,840
好吧
Ok.

267
00:20:56,070 --> 00:20:58,170
泰德  如果你真的是我
Ted, if you're really me,

268
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,520
我接下來會伸出幾根手指
how many fingers am I about to hold up?

269
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,720
三根
Three.

270
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:05,440
你答對了
You're right!

271
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,180
出發吧  老兄  我們開車
Let's go, guys. We'll drive.

272
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:17,180
-泰德  -干嘛
- Ted. - What?

273
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,020
我有預感  我們即將踏上
I have a feeling we're about to embark upon

274
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,820
一次史無前例的探險之旅
a most unprecedented expedition.

275
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,630
-老兄  -干嘛
- Dude. - What?

276
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,840
我的機器老二性奮了
I got a full-on robot chubby.

277
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,680
之后再說  邪惡泰德
Later, Evil Ted.

278
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:33,840
之后再說
Later.

279
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,130
我好冷
I'm cold.

280
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,450
老兄  能不能開下后面的暖氣
Dudes can we have some heat back here?

281
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:57,090
閉嘴  比爾
Shut up, Bill.

282
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,500
另一個你可真混蛋
That other you's a real jerk.

283
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,900
是啊
Yeah.

284
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,860
我變成他之前  我是出了名的
I get a rumor to be more considerate towards myseIf

285
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,510
體貼關心自己
when I become him.

286
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,380
他說  閉上你的臭嘴
He said, shut your holes!

287
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,640
老兄  我有種很糟的預感
Dude, I got a very bad feeling.

288
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,260
出去
Out.

289
00:22:57,630 --> 00:23:00,920
所以  喬安娜和伊麗莎白在哪里
So, where are Joanna and Elizabeth?

290
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,360
她們不在這里
They're not here.

291
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,300
我們騙了你們的  真相是
We lied. Here's the truth,

292
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,730
我們現在要殺了你們

293
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:11,040
-不是吧  -確實是  泰德
- No way! - Yes way, Ted.

294
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:12,970
我們的設定就是這樣
We're fully programmed to do it.

295
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,230
沒錯  而且我們也想殺了你們
Yeah, and we want to do it too.

296
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,540
你個混蛋  比爾
You dick, Bill!

297
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,230
-老兄  你居然是金屬的  -不可思議吧  你看
- You're metal, dude! - I know. Check it out.

298
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,590
開始吧
Let's go.

299
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,180
假貨

300
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:15,480
泰德
Ted.

301
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,590
我們得做點什么
We gotta do something.

302
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,370
老兄  雖然你們要殺了我們
Dudes, even though you're doing this...

303
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,580

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:40,980
回見啊  比爾和泰德
Catch you later, Bill and Ted!

308
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:02,380
太棒了  完全對準了那個好人比爾
Yes! I totally loogied on that good dead me!

309
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,470
-我們是火力全開的邪惡機器人  -沒錯
- We're fully, full-on evil robots. - Yeah!

310
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:15,060
-我們開車走嗎  -不了  那車爛透了
- You wanna take the van? - No, it's beat.

311
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,390
有輛保時捷
There's a Porsche.

312
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,080
{\an7}{\pos(261,21)}保時捷911

314
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,510
拿下它
Let's bag it.

315
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,370
基站
Station.

316
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,100
比爾
Bill...

317
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:07,980
發生什么了
what happened?

318
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:10,850
泰德
Ted...

319
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,900
我們死了  老兄
we're dead, dude.

320
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:20,800
-不是吧  -確實是
- No way. - Yes way.

321
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,370
你看
Look.

322
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,710
現在怎么辦
Now what?

323
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,270
那是誰
Who's that?

324
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,360
你是誰
Who are you?

325
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,230
泰德
Ted...

326
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,540
那是死神  老兄
it's the Grim Reaper, dude.

327
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,630
過得好嗎  死神
How's it hanging, Death?

328
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,730
你們隨我來
You will come with me.

329
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,740
不行  我們得去找寶貝們
We can't. We gotta get back to the babes.

330
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:11,370
泰德  我們去不了  我們死了  老兄
Ted, we can't. We're dead, dude.

331
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,660
我們得阻止邪惡二人組  至少得試試
We gotta stop these evil "Usses." We gotta try.

332
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,500
抱歉  老兄  有復活的辦法嗎
Excuse us, dude, but is there any way back?

333
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,900
你們可以向我發起挑戰
You may challenge me to a contest.

334
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:28,210
可要是你們輸了
But if you lose...

335
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:31,540
就得留在這里
you will remain here in the afterlife...

336
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:33,270
永生永世
forever.

337
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,490
要是我們贏了呢
What if we win?

338
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:44,490
從未有人贏過
No one has ever won.

339
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:50,240
-老兄  我們得甩掉這家伙  -絕對的
- Dude, we gotta ditch this guy. - Definitely.

340
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,480
可是怎么甩
But how?

341
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,460
拉褲襠
Melvin.

342
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,470
對不起  兄弟
Excuse us, dude...

343
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,950
你的鞋帶松了
...but your shoes are untied.

344
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,870
不敢相信我們拉了死神的褲襠
I can't believe we just melvined Death.

345
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:24,040
希望他追不上我們
Let's just hope he doesn't catch up with us.

346
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,830

圣迪馬斯  50公里

347
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,350
不是吧
No way!

348
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,850
這不好笑
This isn't funny.

349
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:13,660
干得好  喬安娜
Way to go, Joanna!

350
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,750
我不知道你們被什么附身了
I don't understand what's come over you two.

351
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:20,490
我們曾經是弱雞  但現在是金屬硬漢
You see, we used to be puss-weeds, but now we're metal.

352
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,620
過來放開玩吧
So get over here and put out!

353
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:28,230
走吧  今晚你們就別想我們演出了
Let's go. You can forget about us playing tonight.

354
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,090
好吧
Fine.

355
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,330
我想只能這樣了
Then I guess that's that.

356
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,290
再見
Yeah, see you.

357
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,430
再會  寶貝們
Catch you later, babes!

358
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,710
泰德  我有個主意
Ted, I have an idea.

359
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,730
在今晚的音樂會上說完德·諾默勒斯演講后
Tonight the concert after we make De Nomolos' speech...

360
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:13,650
我們就上了她倆
...let's waste them.

361
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:19,330
基站  同時把這個老鼠洞廢了
Station. In the meantime, let's trash this lame rathole.

362
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,070
太棒了  邪惡泰德
Stellar, Evil Ted!

363
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:32,010
-泰德  我們必須阻止他們  -是啊  但怎么做
- Ted, we have got to stop them. - Yeah. But how?

364
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,950
希望這有用
I hope this works.

365
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:41,020
在《驅魔人》第一部和第三部里都有用
It worked in The Exorcist. I and III!

366
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,510
赫希菲爾德
All right, Herschfeld.

367
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,560
你調去市中心  狄洛奇就可以休產假
You'll move downtown so DeLoach can take her maternity leave.

368
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,430
我們還要安排一些輪崗
AIso, we need to make a few shifts,

369
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:55,330
有人想值晚班嗎
anyone interested in moonlighting...

370
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,690
我們要加強今晚舉辦樂隊大戰的
...we're stepping up security of the amphitheater tonight

371
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,070
露天劇院的安保
for the Battle of the Bands.

372
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,990
我聽說你兒子的樂隊要表演
I hear your son's band is playing.

373
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,070
多謝提醒  警長
Thank you for reminding me, sergeant.

374
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,570
此外  斯科特·弗蘭克
AIso, Scott Frank...

375
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,680
-現在怎么辦  -我不知道
- So, how do we do this? - I don't know.

376
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,880
不如你試試
Why don't you try yourseIf?

377
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,540
好吧
Okay.

378
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,880
各位兄弟
Okay, dudes.

379
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,590
我是說  警察同僚們
I mean, fellow policemen...

380
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:45,580

00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:48,650
和他的朋友比爾·普雷斯頓先生
...and his friend Bill Preston, Esquire...

382
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,780
被人謀殺
...have been murdered and

383
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:53,330
并被來自未來的邪惡機器人代替
replaced by evil robots from the future.

384
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:55,360
你真的做到了  兄弟
You totally did it, dude!

385
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:57,550
我附身了我老爸
I totally possessed my dad.

386
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,350
好了
Okay.

387
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:06,590
你們要去逮捕這些機器人
You got to go over and arrest these robots

388
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,190
這樣他們不會毀了我和比爾的一切
so they don't ruin everything for me and Bill.

389
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,100
我的兒子和比爾
I mean, my son and Bill.

390
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,090
最重要的是  他們不會傷害寶貝們
And, most importantly, they don't hurt the babes.

391
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,460
公主們
The princesses.

392
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:23,380
這沒用
This isn't working.

393
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,190
-幫我一把  兄弟  -好的  兄弟
- Back me up, dude. - You got it, dude.

394

-我死了以后超餓  -是啊
- I got really hungry being dead. - Yeah!

398
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,880
比爾  我覺得他們不相信我們
Bill, I don't think they believe us.

399
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,700
我們要找到會相信的人
We have to find someone who will.

400
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,870
再會  警察兄弟們
Catch you later, cop dudes!

401
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,690
泰德  我們不能這樣出去
Ted, we can't go like this.

402
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:26,910
謝謝老爸
Thanks, Dad.

我想和泰·柯布對話
And I would like to contact Ty Cobb.

411
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,700
-這個降神會有用嗎  -沒有
- Has this séance stuff ever worked? - No.

412
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,250
但今天會的  兄弟
But it will today, dude.

413
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,500
來自陰間的偉大靈魂啊
Oh, great spirits from the netherworld...

414
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:26,860
離開你們的安逸居所  向我們傳授
...leave your celestial abode and speak upon us...

415
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,790
你的人生經驗
...with your life lessons.

416
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,100
我感覺有神靈降臨
I feel the spirits have arrived!

417

這地方完全不是我想的那樣
This is not what I expected this place to look like at all.

656

但我們贏得了復生的機會

658
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:31,440
我們要想辦法救心愛的女人
We need to construct something to help saving the women we love.

659
00:56:32,710 --> 00:56:36,020

And we don't get a lot of time. So we were wondering...

844
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:26,240
我想讓整個宇宙都見證這一刻
I want the whole universe to behold this...

845

權力的更迭

846

我們未來的社會

847
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:36,920
不會再建立于這兩個白癡的

想法和音樂了

只有我的想法
...and my ideas alone!

851
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:53,890
哥們  這情況怎么辦  我們沒時間了
Dude, how do we get out of this? We don't got any time.

我們就用電話亭  時間旅行到比賽前
...we use the booth, we time-travel back to before the concert

854
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:02,150
然后布置一些能抓住他的陷進
and set up the things we need to get him now.

855
01:18:02,290 --> 01:18:04,360
好啊  比如什么

妙啊
Excellent!

858

01:18:24,810 --> 01:18:26,170
我的朋友們
My friends.

860
01:18:27,230 --> 01:18:29,550
我也可以玩時間旅行的游戲
I too can play the time game.

861
01:18:30,030 --> 01:18:33,010
如果你這么做  等我擊敗你們后
If you do that, once I have vanquished you...

862
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,810
我就回去準備這把鑰匙

865
01:19:00,430 --> 01:19:03,680

Right, dude. Only there's one thing you didn't think of.

866
01:19:03,680 --> 01:19:07,270
