1
00:00:43,911 --> 00:00:45,736
Steady as you go.

2
00:00:51,828 --> 00:00:53,570
Steady now, steady.

3
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:56,949
All right,
let's have it on the truck.

4
00:01:04,495 --> 00:01:06,532
Is that all they need?

5
00:01:06,745 --> 00:01:10,821
Yes, I think so. How long
will it take to fill the order?

6
00:01:11,036 --> 00:01:14,319
- Probably 3 to 4 weeks.
- We need a better service.

7
00:01:14,536 --> 00:01:16,693
A boat once a week isn't enough.

8
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,574
At least they could
install telephones.

9
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:23,117
- Yes. They promised them this year.
- Yes, and last.

10
00:01:24,328 --> 00:01:27,030
- Morning, Campbell, Peter, Ian.
- Morning, Dr. Landers.

11
00:01:27,245 --> 00:01:29,152
I'd like to mail these people.

12
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:30,573
More books?

13
00:01:30,828 --> 00:01:33,909
You islanders are too hardy.
I have to keep busy.

14
00:01:34,203 --> 00:01:36,822
You know, you and I
should take up chess.

15
00:01:37,036 --> 00:01:39,116
I've nothing to do either,
except when Andy McCracken

16
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,196
has a drop too much
and tries to brig up the pub.

17
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:45,328
Why not try talking
to Dr Phillips over there?

18
00:02:01,495 --> 00:02:05,323
He doesn't like company. That's why
he picked this isolated place.

19
00:02:05,536 --> 00:02:07,029
No contact with the mainland.

20
00:02:07,245 --> 00:02:09,650
- He's an odd one.
- Not really,

21
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,275
he's one of the top
research men in the worid.

22
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:16,240
- Researchers are like that.
- We wouldn't mind a bit of contact.

23
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:19,821
They don't care about us,
we don't pay enough taxes.

24
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:23,568
- Right, Constable?
- Speak for yourself, Ian.

25
00:02:25,036 --> 00:02:28,817
- It smells like fog.
- I think it'll be a lovely evening.

26
00:02:29,036 --> 00:02:31,193
If you weren't a newcomer,
you'd feel it.

27
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:33,616
A newcomer!
I've been here for ten years.

28
00:02:33,828 --> 00:02:36,032
A newcomer just the same.

29
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:10,322
Good.

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,904
The cell cultures are prepared,
we can begin.

31
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,948
Are we going ahead without hearing
from Rome, New York, Tokio?

32
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:22,369
I've mailed them full reports.
They'll start when they get them.

33
00:03:22,578 --> 00:03:25,245
The potential across the cell
membrane must be maintained

34
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,574
during the radiation of the nucleus.

35
00:03:27,828 --> 00:03:30,032
- Is the tritium state complete?
- Yes.

36
00:03:30,245 --> 00:03:32,947
- And the vapour applicator?
- It's been corrected.

37
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:36,693
- The connect problem has been solved.
- Good.

38
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:39,472
Now we've received
the infusion equipment,

39
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,863
I'm certain they'll understand
my reasons for going ahead.

40
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:45,657
I've waited
a long time for this moment.

41
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:50,576
If we're successful today, it may
well be we have the cure for cancer.

42
00:06:56,003 --> 00:06:57,875
- Mrs. Bellows, come in.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:58,086 --> 00:06:59,958
Go over there by the fire.

44
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:03,870
- What brings you here?
- I'm so sorry to bother you,

45
00:07:04,086 --> 00:07:06,871
but I'm worried about Ian.
He hasn't come home.

46
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:09,954
- Sit down. I'll get you some tea.
- No, thank you.

47
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:12,836
Now settle down,
and tell me all about it.

48
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,794
Lan hasn't come home, he's three
hours late and that isn't like him.

49
00:07:18,003 --> 00:07:19,579
I'm afraid something's happened.

50
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,872
I'm sure it's nothing.
Did you try the pub?

51
00:07:23,086 --> 00:07:26,286
They haven't seen him.
I've been all round the village.

52
00:07:26,503 --> 00:07:28,956
I'll tell you what,
I'll look for him,

53
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:31,042
you go home and I'll bring him.

54
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:35,617
- Do you think he's had an accident?
- No, I'm sure everything's all right.

55
00:07:35,836 --> 00:07:38,407
I'll take a look at your north
field near Philips' house.

56
00:07:38,795 --> 00:07:40,702
Go on home and don't worry.

57
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,451
I'll do as you say.
Sorry for being a nuisance.

58
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,415
- That's what I'm here for.
- Thank you very much indeed.

59
00:08:16,336 --> 00:08:17,829
Lan!

60
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,294
Lan Bellows!

61
00:08:46,003 --> 00:08:47,247
Lan!

62
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:07,246
Doctor Landers!

63
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,411
- Thank God.
- You're in a state.

64
00:10:12,628 --> 00:10:15,403
- I am.
- Come in.

65
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:20,621
Sit over there.

66
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,748
Now, tell me, what's happened?

67
00:10:25,128 --> 00:10:29,750
Now, listen. I'm not a man
that's easily shaken, Doctor.

68
00:10:29,961 --> 00:10:32,747
- I know. Would you like a drink?
- No, no.

69
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,416
I've just seen something
and by all that's holy,

70
00:10:37,628 --> 00:10:41,124
I just can't be sure,
but I think it's Ian Bellows.

71
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:44,166
You think it's Ian?
What's happened?

72
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:49,036
I don't know,
his body is all like jelly.

73
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:54,117
- Jelly!
- Aye. Like nothing I've ever seen.

74
00:10:55,420 --> 00:11:01,168
There was no face just a horrible
mush with the eyes sitting in it.

75
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,621
Where did this happen?

76
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:08,544
Up near the peninsula,
on the path to Parson's Cove.

77
00:11:09,128 --> 00:11:12,825
- Did anyone else see it?
- No, no, I don't think so.

78
00:11:14,836 --> 00:11:18,533
Come on, I'll get my hat and coat.
We'll go over there.

79
00:11:24,961 --> 00:11:27,628
It's a body,
but I can't recognise it.

80
00:11:28,045 --> 00:11:30,959
- Those are Ian Bellow's clothes.
- Yes.

81
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:34,750
- What's happened to him?
- I don't know.

82
00:11:35,003 --> 00:11:38,783
As far as I can tell, the body
doesn't seem to have any bones.

83
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,829
No bones?

84
00:11:44,961 --> 00:11:46,241
Look.

85
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:51,127
You see.

86
00:11:51,545 --> 00:11:55,206
I have to make a closer examination.
Let's get it back to the village.

87
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,702
- I'll get something to carry it on.
- I'll wait here.

88
00:12:01,961 --> 00:12:03,502
Hurry up, will you?

89
00:12:11,045 --> 00:12:15,583
It's definitely Ian. I recognised
the appendectomy scar and birth mark.

90
00:12:15,795 --> 00:12:18,709
My God.
What will I tell Mrs. Bellows?

91
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,285
I'll come with you and give her
a sedative. She'll need it.

92
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:27,293
Don't mention the condition
of the body.

93
00:12:27,503 --> 00:12:29,079
Of course not. I understand.

94
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,209
In fact, I don't want
this mentioned to anyone.

95
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,707
They'll have to know soon enough.

96
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,491
Not until I find out
what we're dealing with.

97
00:12:37,961 --> 00:12:39,668
What are you going to do?

98
00:12:40,503 --> 00:12:43,501
First, I'll go and see Phillips,
I need expert help.

99
00:12:43,711 --> 00:12:47,835
- This is quite beyond my knowledge.
- What if he won't help, or can't?

100
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:51,457
I'll take the emergency launch and
visit Brian Stanley in London.

101
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,415
That's our only contact with
the mainland in case we need help.

102
00:12:55,628 --> 00:12:57,749
Don't worry,
I'll come back immediately.

103
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,537
Who is this Brian Stanley?

104
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:02,537
He's the most eminent
pathologist in Britain.

105
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:07,750
Whatever this disease is, it's
virulent and could be contagious.

106
00:13:08,253 --> 00:13:13,041
We might fly back, so build
a signal fire on Moor Heights.

107
00:13:20,753 --> 00:13:23,158
That'll be all for today, gentlemen.

108
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:24,830
I...

109
00:13:25,045 --> 00:13:28,245
I do hope some of what
I've been saying has penetrated.

110
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:33,043
From your last papers, I doubt if
you'll progress beyond first aid.

111
00:13:33,253 --> 00:13:34,580
Good day.

112
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:45,870
- Oh, Dr. Stanley.
- Yes?

113
00:13:46,086 --> 00:13:49,666
- This is Dr. Landers.
- Yes, I heard your telephone message.

114
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:53,493
- How do you do? Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

115
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:57,039
I practice on Peter's Island.
- Where's that?

116
00:13:57,479 --> 00:14:00,845
- Off the East coast of Ireland.
- And what can I do for you?

117
00:14:01,469 --> 00:14:05,379
Do you know of any disease
that could dissolve human bone?

118
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:08,417
No, I don't. Why?

119
00:14:09,128 --> 00:14:11,830
We've discovered a body
without any trace of bone in it.

120
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:17,289
- No bone? Are you certain?
- Quite certain.

121
00:14:18,693 --> 00:14:20,020
That's unbelievable!

122
00:14:20,628 --> 00:14:25,167
- Have you heard this before?
- Nothing even remotely like it.

123
00:14:26,086 --> 00:14:28,207
I was hoping you could help me.

124
00:14:29,211 --> 00:14:32,458
- There was no trace of bone?
- None.

125
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:35,255
If that's true, it's beyond me.

126
00:14:35,378 --> 00:14:38,137
It's true.
I performed a complete autopsy.

127
00:14:45,161 --> 00:14:47,365
- Have you heard of David West?
- I think so.

128
00:14:47,578 --> 00:14:50,576
He's the most qualified man
on bone disease I know.

129
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:55,159
Let's try the Medical Library first,
then we'll go and see David.

130
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,941
- If you think he'll help.
- If anyone can, he can.

131
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:22,283
I couldn't find your bathrobe.

132
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:25,494
I'm sure you don't find the female
anatomy shocking.

133
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:27,777
It's different from Harley St.
How's your dress?

134
00:15:27,995 --> 00:15:31,941
The spot's out,
but it'll take some time to dry.

135
00:15:32,161 --> 00:15:35,693
- Cured beautifully, don't you think?
- The credit isn't all mine.

136
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,653
- Excellent cognac, David.
- From an expert, that's a compliment.

137
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,449
You shouldn't believe everything
you read, they exaggerate.

138
00:15:43,745 --> 00:15:46,150
Everything about you
is exaggerated.

139
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:49,451
You're too charming. To think
I had to break a leg to meet you.

140
00:15:49,661 --> 00:15:52,197
And write off a very expensive
Maserati.

141
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:55,943
Not every girl goes to such lengths
to meet a man.

142
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:58,780
Besides, I'm sure it's going
to be worth it, isn't it?

143
00:15:58,995 --> 00:16:01,483
I may not get to places
as fast as a Maserati.

144
00:16:01,703 --> 00:16:04,736
- But you do get there eventually.
- Eventually.

145
00:16:04,953 --> 00:16:06,529
- When?
- I'll let you know.

146
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:11,201
Don't take too long. You might
run out of petrol on the last lap.

147
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:21,242
- A pitstop or the checkered flag?
- I don't know.

148
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:24,992
But in the meantime, my dressing gown
is in the bathroom.

149
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,945
Brian, what do you want
at this time?

150
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,994
Good evening, David. I hope
we're interrupting something.

151
00:16:38,203 --> 00:16:41,201
- May I present Dr. Reginald Landers.
- How do you do?

152
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:43,781
He's brought you
an interesting problem.

153
00:16:43,995 --> 00:16:47,775
Yes. I've already got
an interesting problem for tonight.

154
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,239
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

155
00:16:53,495 --> 00:16:54,904
We are interrupting.

156
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,532
Miss Toni Merrill, may I introduce
Dr. Stanley and Dr. Landers.

157
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:00,285
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

158
00:17:00,495 --> 00:17:02,118
Excuse my dress.

159
00:17:02,328 --> 00:17:06,985
David is better with a scalpel
that he is opening a bottle of wine.

160
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:11,444
Reginald practices on some
little island off the Irish coast.

161
00:17:11,661 --> 00:17:14,494
He's found a body
without any trace of bone.

162
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:18,941
No bones? Yes, of course,
this is quite a common...

163
00:17:19,161 --> 00:17:21,697
- I'm serious, doctor.
- I'm sorry, doctor.

164
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:25,822
I wasn't implying any lack of ability,
but it's difficult to accept.

165
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:28,739
- I can show you the body.
- He did a complete autopsy.

166
00:17:29,911 --> 00:17:32,365
- No bones?
- No bones.

167
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,948
- Any contusions or lacerations?
- Not a trace.

168
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:40,134
That's why we're tossing it
into your lap.

169
00:17:40,245 --> 00:17:43,445
I hate to disappoint you, but I've
never heard of anything like this.

170
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:46,322
What was the medical history?

171
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:49,941
Practically no medical history.
He was a strong, healthy farmer.

172
00:17:49,966 --> 00:17:53,372
- Interesting problem, eh?
- Very. I'd like to see the body.

173
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:56,285
I was going to have a look
at it myself. Like to come?

174
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:57,822
- Yes.
- Good.

175
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:01,114
I'm sure they'll call it
"West's Disease".

176
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,303
This sudden humility
astounds me!

177
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:06,544
They've named so many after me,
it'll cause confusion.

178
00:18:06,786 --> 00:18:10,669
- When are you leaving?
- Tonight. We'll need a plane.

179
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,886
- You could use my father's plane.
- We need a sea plane.

180
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:16,118
- It's a helicopter.
- That's nice of you, Toni.

181
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,541
- There's a catch.
- I should've known.

182
00:18:18,753 --> 00:18:21,621
- I'm going with you.
- We don't know what we're up against.

183
00:18:22,045 --> 00:18:25,576
It's an unknown disease,
we can't anticipate the effects.

184
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:27,788
Nevertheless, I'm going.

185
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,252
- Time is important.
- Quite so, quite.

186
00:18:31,586 --> 00:18:33,245
Yes, I know.

187
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:36,872
Very well, we accept
your offer and the condition.

188
00:18:37,086 --> 00:18:39,919
If you'll excuse me,
I'll telephone my father.

189
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,960
We'll stop by my lab
and pick up some equipment.

190
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:48,750
I can't wait for you. Your father
needs the helicopter.

191
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:50,869
That's all right, is it?

192
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:52,460
We don't have much choice.

193
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,372
I'll come back in a couple
of days.

194
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:58,952
- Right.
- We'll be marooned on the island.

195
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:02,289
We won't have any contact
with the mainland.

196
00:19:02,503 --> 00:19:04,873
I can't take
the emergency launch back.

197
00:19:05,128 --> 00:19:08,494
It's too late for other arrangements.
We'll have to make do.

198
00:19:08,711 --> 00:19:11,662
I had no idea my father
would need the helicopter.

199
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:14,746
What did Napoleon do on that island
of his to him busy?

200
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:16,668
He invented solitaire.

201
00:19:16,878 --> 00:19:20,125
- I've a much better game in mind.
- Can three play?

202
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,828
Fascinating game, solitaire.

203
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:39,091
- Hello, John. How's Mrs. Bellows?
- Those pills did the trick.

204
00:21:39,186 --> 00:21:40,186
Good.

205
00:21:40,728 --> 00:21:43,477
Constable Harris,
may I introduce Dr. Stanley,

206
00:21:43,686 --> 00:21:46,175
- Miss Merrill and Dr. West.
- How do you do?

207
00:21:46,395 --> 00:21:48,848
- Does anybody know about Ian?
- No.

208
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:52,143
- Have you been in touch with Philips?
- No, he's not been down.

209
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,758
Philips?
Dr. Lawrence Philips.

210
00:21:54,978 --> 00:21:57,218
Oh, Dr. Philips!
What's he doing out here?

211
00:21:57,645 --> 00:22:00,761
- This is where he set up his lab.
- He could be of great help.

212
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:03,769
You've got to get to him first.
He's a recluse.

213
00:22:04,103 --> 00:22:06,058
Who is he?
What does he do?

214
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,928
Top man in cancer research.

215
00:22:08,436 --> 00:22:10,593
Before we do anything,
let's see that body.

216
00:22:16,478 --> 00:22:18,184
Not a very pretty sight.

217
00:22:29,103 --> 00:22:32,101
I intend to make
the first incision here. Agreed?

218
00:22:32,311 --> 00:22:33,473
Agreed.

219
00:22:46,186 --> 00:22:48,058
Here's something interesting.

220
00:22:49,895 --> 00:22:53,723
There are a series of minute
punctures in this dermal segment.

221
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,098
That's odd.

222
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:58,432
Let's collect segments
from other parts of the body.

223
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:00,931
Try staining it with eosin.

224
00:23:08,395 --> 00:23:11,725
- It's the same with all of them.
- They're all over the body.

225
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:14,555
I've never seen anything
like these punctures before.

226
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:17,436
Could something have entered
the body through them?

227
00:23:17,645 --> 00:23:20,845
- Like what, for instance?
- It's possible some enzyme

228
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:23,182
was introduced into the body
through the punctures.

229
00:23:23,395 --> 00:23:28,017
If they are punctures. I can't tell
if they're punctures or ruptures.

230
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:32,519
Something came out or some organism
producing an enzyme went in.

231
00:23:33,561 --> 00:23:36,015
There's no trace of calcium
phosphate in the body.

232
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:39,264
Then this enzyme,
or whatever it is,

233
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:42,511
seems to attack and break down
the calcium phosphate.

234
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:45,560
A major component of human bone.

235
00:23:45,936 --> 00:23:47,844
We don't know
if there's a connection

236
00:23:48,061 --> 00:23:50,810
between the perforations
and the absence of bone.

237
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,804
They could be two evidences
of a similar syndrome.

238
00:23:54,603 --> 00:23:56,060
We'll have to assume it.

239
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,758
If we only had more complete
facilities.

240
00:23:58,978 --> 00:24:01,929
There's Philips' lab,
but I don't know if he'll talk to us.

241
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,224
- He'll talk to me.
- How well equipped is he?

242
00:24:05,436 --> 00:24:08,185
I've never seen it,
but I believe it's complete.

243
00:24:09,311 --> 00:24:11,385
Don't say the lights
are going to fail.

244
00:24:11,603 --> 00:24:13,677
We've had trouble
with the generator.

245
00:24:13,895 --> 00:24:16,383
- Let's get out to Philips' place.
- All right.

246
00:24:16,603 --> 00:24:20,182
I'd better leave a note
for Constable Harris at his house.

247
00:24:32,145 --> 00:24:34,847
What a climate!
How do they stay healthy?

248
00:24:35,686 --> 00:24:37,973
Does that generator supply
all this island?

249
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:41,931
All the electrical power. I've been
after them for months to fix it.

250
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:45,269
- Is that the house up there?
- That's it.

251
00:24:45,770 --> 00:24:48,223
Good Lord, it looks like
"Wuthering Heights".

252
00:25:14,645 --> 00:25:16,303
Try again.

253
00:25:17,853 --> 00:25:20,140
I don't think it'll do much good.

254
00:25:22,936 --> 00:25:25,425
We must get into that lab somehow.

255
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:29,053
- I'll look around. Got a torch?
- Yes, I have.

256
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:34,059
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

257
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:36,723
Wait here.
I'll find a way in.

258
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:46,179
- I've found another body.
- The same as the other?

259
00:27:57,895 --> 00:28:01,307
- Where's the laboratory?
- I don't know. I've never been here.

260
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,681
We'll find it.

261
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:18,268
Let's try down here!

262
00:28:51,186 --> 00:28:55,808
Isotopes. He's got as much equipment
here as I have at the University.

263
00:28:58,186 --> 00:28:59,560
There's the lab.

264
00:29:23,978 --> 00:29:25,885
There's one over here, as well.

265
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,434
Were there signs of a struggle
with Bellows?

266
00:29:33,645 --> 00:29:36,133
You couldn't tell,
it was in a cave.

267
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,300
Philips had no contact in the village.
It's not a contagious disease.

268
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,387
Whatever it was,
it must've started in this lab.

269
00:29:43,603 --> 00:29:45,641
Bellows' body was found
not far away.

270
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:49,598
If it did start here, it might be
moving down towards the village.

271
00:29:49,811 --> 00:29:52,134
Well, they were either fighting
something,

272
00:29:52,353 --> 00:29:54,640
or the death throes
were violent.

273
00:29:55,311 --> 00:29:57,634
Why don't we study
Philips' notes?

274
00:29:57,853 --> 00:30:00,768
- It could give us a lead.
- All right.

275
00:31:03,145 --> 00:31:05,550
All right, hold on, I'm coming!

276
00:31:09,853 --> 00:31:12,093
Come in, you're in time for tea.

277
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:16,305
John, I found one of my horses dead.

278
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:20,845
At least I think it's one of
my horses, it's all soft and flabby.

279
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:25,223
- Where did it happen?
- In my field.

280
00:31:26,061 --> 00:31:27,969
I've got to tell Dr. Landers.

281
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:30,722
He's at Philips' place,
according to this note.

282
00:31:30,936 --> 00:31:32,892
Then I'll take a look
at your horse.

283
00:31:33,103 --> 00:31:36,599
- Don't mention this to anyone.
- Why not?

284
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,640
Don't ask foolish questions,
do as I say. Now, go on.

285
00:31:40,853 --> 00:31:43,057
I'll let you know everything
in a while.

286
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:56,332
You get started,
I'll tell Harris we're back.

287
00:31:56,553 --> 00:31:58,591
Right. Meet us here,
we've a lot to read.

288
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:00,296
I'll be back shortly.

289
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,216
I could do with food and coffee.
It's been a hard day.

290
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,463
Doctor Landers?

291
00:33:07,178 --> 00:33:08,719
Doctor Landers?

292
00:33:34,928 --> 00:33:36,718
Doctor Landers!

293
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,379
Doctor Landers?

294
00:35:50,686 --> 00:35:53,353
It was a horrible looking mess.

295
00:35:53,853 --> 00:35:55,180
- Good morning, doctor.
- Morning.

296
00:35:55,436 --> 00:35:58,802
- Has anyone seen Constable Harris?
- He said he'd meet you at Philips'.

297
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,686
He's gone up to my fields
to look at my horse.

298
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:04,348
- What's that?
- He's gone to Philips' place.

299
00:36:04,561 --> 00:36:06,884
My horse is dead
and he's gone up there.

300
00:36:07,103 --> 00:36:10,385
- What happened to your horse?
- If it is my horse.

301
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:13,341
It's a bloody mess,
a pile of flesh.

302
00:36:13,853 --> 00:36:15,927
- In your fields?
- Yes.

303
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:20,345
- The other side of the island...
- Pardon?

304
00:36:20,603 --> 00:36:23,435
Nothing. Excuse me,
I've got to go.

305
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:26,761
- Wait, what's going on here?
- I can't explain now.

306
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:31,344
Some peculiar goings on
on this island.

307
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:35,186
It was a bit abrupt
on the doctor's part.

308
00:36:36,436 --> 00:36:40,382
He may be right.
I'll go and see Campbell.

309
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:54,266
You're the head of the island,
what do you plan to do?

310
00:36:54,478 --> 00:36:56,599
It's no good dithering about.

311
00:36:56,811 --> 00:37:00,556
We better go and talk to the farmers
and then see Dr. Landers.

312
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:13,598
A farmer has found his horse
on the other side of the peninsula.

313
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:18,144
Harris has gone to Philips' place.
We must've just missed him.

314
00:37:18,561 --> 00:37:22,176
- Did you find anything?
- Philips was doing cancer research.

315
00:37:22,395 --> 00:37:26,803
He was creating a form of living
matter to counteract the cancer.

316
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,299
What do you think?

317
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,217
He might've succeeded in creating
some form of life in his lair.

318
00:37:32,436 --> 00:37:35,553
- That caused these deaths?
- We haven't read all his notes.

319
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,186
Shall we take a look at the horse,
and pick up Harris?

320
00:37:39,395 --> 00:37:42,476
We should let him know
at least what we know.

321
00:37:42,686 --> 00:37:44,511
- Good morning.
- Hello, Toni.

322
00:37:44,728 --> 00:37:46,849
You look like you've been up
all night.

323
00:37:47,061 --> 00:37:48,258
We have.

324
00:37:48,478 --> 00:37:51,511
- How about some breakfast?
- We've just had supper.

325
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:54,477
- We have to go to Philips' place.
- Right, let's go.

326
00:37:54,686 --> 00:37:57,389
- I'm afraid you can't come.
- Why not?

327
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:01,013
- It might be dangerous.
- What might?

328
00:38:01,478 --> 00:38:05,175
Look, last night we went up there
and found four more bodies.

329
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:10,179
We think they created something in
that lab that's causing these deaths.

330
00:38:10,395 --> 00:38:12,432
- What do you mean "something"?
- Just that...

331
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,345
We don't know, yet.

332
00:38:14,895 --> 00:38:18,675
If you there's something running
loose, you can't leave me alone!

333
00:38:18,895 --> 00:38:22,260
- Toni, this could be...
- Please! Don't leave me alone.

334
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,679
Perhaps you're right.

335
00:38:47,324 --> 00:38:48,485
Oh, no!

336
00:38:56,861 --> 00:38:59,942
- What's happened?
- Something was on the rear window.

337
00:39:00,153 --> 00:39:02,108
- What?
- I'm not quite sure.

338
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,690
- What did it look like?
- It was...

339
00:39:04,903 --> 00:39:07,308
I don't know, it was greyish.

340
00:39:07,528 --> 00:39:09,922
- Think, this is important.
- There was a strange sound.

341
00:39:10,255 --> 00:39:12,376
- What kind of a sound?
- I don't know...

342
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:14,541
Let's have a look.

343
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:30,317
Brian, hold it!
Come back to the car.

344
00:39:34,778 --> 00:39:38,724
We better not get too close
until we know what we're up against.

345
00:39:38,945 --> 00:39:40,170
What do you think it is?

346
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:42,897
I don't know,
but let's not take any risks.

347
00:39:43,111 --> 00:39:44,439
Especially with me.

348
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:47,521
We better get Harris and get back,
we might need help.

349
00:40:27,195 --> 00:40:30,442
- He must be here, that's his bicycle.
- Toni, stay in the car.

350
00:40:30,695 --> 00:40:32,602
No, not with those things
around.

351
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,391
Let her come, I wouldn't
want to stay here alone.

352
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:37,602
OK, but stick close together.

353
00:40:40,236 --> 00:40:41,433
Harris?

354
00:40:42,528 --> 00:40:44,186
Constable Harris?

355
00:40:44,528 --> 00:40:45,902
Harris?

356
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,810
Let's see if he's in the basement.

357
00:40:58,195 --> 00:40:59,439
Harris?

358
00:41:01,486 --> 00:41:04,189
Look! It's Harris.

359
00:41:23,486 --> 00:41:25,062
Good Lord, what's that?

360
00:41:28,361 --> 00:41:30,103
Let's get out of here.

361
00:42:03,778 --> 00:42:05,271
Don't get too close!

362
00:43:12,695 --> 00:43:14,152
They've divided!

363
00:43:18,570 --> 00:43:21,105
- Let's get through them.
- Wait!

364
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,943
Let me try first.

365
00:43:37,653 --> 00:43:38,815
Come on!

366
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,444
No, no.

367
00:43:41,653 --> 00:43:44,438
- We've got to. Now. Come on!
- No!

368
00:43:44,861 --> 00:43:47,694
Hurry! They may not remain
inactive long.

369
00:43:47,903 --> 00:43:50,570
Listen! They're inactive
because they divided

370
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:53,349
but we don't know for how long,
So, come on!

371
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:56,354
- David, I'm so frightened.
- So am I.

372
00:44:01,028 --> 00:44:02,734
- Are you all right?
- No!

373
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:05,813
- There's one out here.
- Into the car, quick!

374
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,647
Damn!

375
00:44:32,695 --> 00:44:34,934
- Hurry!
- I'm trying!

376
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:42,652
I think that's got it.

377
00:45:10,111 --> 00:45:11,521
Here, take this.

378
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,020
- Come on, drink it.
- Oh, David...

379
00:45:15,236 --> 00:45:16,564
Come on.

380
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,602
I want you to get some sleep
and this will do the trick.

381
00:45:21,861 --> 00:45:25,985
I'm so scared.
I've never seen anyone die before.

382
00:45:26,195 --> 00:45:30,235
Now, don't think about it.
We'll find an answer, we've got to.

383
00:45:30,445 --> 00:45:35,067
- I never saw anything so horrible.
- Me neither.

384
00:45:35,945 --> 00:45:39,192
Now, you just relax
and try and get some sleep.

385
00:45:40,111 --> 00:45:43,607
- What's going to happen to us?
- Nothing, we'll be all right.

386
00:45:44,153 --> 00:45:46,523
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

387
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,357
- I'm sorry I ever brought you here.
- There's no reason to be sorry.

388
00:45:52,903 --> 00:45:54,693
I wanted to come.

389
00:45:56,778 --> 00:45:58,568
- David?
- Yes.

390
00:45:59,403 --> 00:46:01,441
Are you really sorry I came?

391
00:46:06,695 --> 00:46:09,942
- I won't let you down.
- I know you won't.

392
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,858
We'll get out of this somehow.

393
00:46:19,695 --> 00:46:21,022
Somehow.

394
00:46:59,820 --> 00:47:02,024
- How is she?
- I gave her a sedative.

395
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,441
Good. I could do
with a sedative myself.

396
00:47:04,653 --> 00:47:06,110
What did you find out?

397
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,567
They're in chronological order.
The last one is a few days old.

398
00:47:09,778 --> 00:47:10,856
What's the entry?

399
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:14,482
It's about Phillips' dog-getting
an overdose of radiation.

400
00:47:14,695 --> 00:47:16,104
Anything else?

401
00:47:16,611 --> 00:47:20,522
They attempted to fuse the nucleus
but look at this protein structure:

402
00:47:20,736 --> 00:47:23,106
It isn't adenosine triphosphate.

403
00:47:49,121 --> 00:47:51,861
Where have you been?
I've come for my goods.

404
00:47:52,061 --> 00:47:54,728
Sorry, Jonesy,
the store's closed today.

405
00:47:54,820 --> 00:47:57,983
- Have you seen Dr. Landers?
- Not since 7 this morning.

406
00:47:58,195 --> 00:48:00,648
He left in his car
with two men and a girl.

407
00:48:00,861 --> 00:48:02,686
- Strangers.
- What strangers?

408
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:04,977
The ones that came in
on the plane, last night.

409
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:06,812
What plane? Where are they?

410
00:48:07,528 --> 00:48:10,147
- Maybe they've over at the inn.
- Come on.

411
00:48:13,254 --> 00:48:14,747
What about my goods?

412
00:48:15,978 --> 00:48:18,892
If you check that
with 404, you see?

413
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,401
Hello. Are you the folk
that are with Dr. Landers?

414
00:48:26,611 --> 00:48:28,270
We've been working with him.
Who are you?

415
00:48:28,528 --> 00:48:32,936
I'm Campbell, head of the island.
This is Argyle who runs the store.

416
00:48:33,153 --> 00:48:34,978
I'm Dr. West
and this is Dr. Stanley.

417
00:48:35,195 --> 00:48:36,195
How do you do?

418
00:48:36,403 --> 00:48:39,235
And where's the Doc?
Dr. Landers?

419
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,027
I'm afraid Dr. Landers is dead.

420
00:48:45,445 --> 00:48:49,273
Dr. Landers dead!
How did it happen?

421
00:48:50,756 --> 00:48:52,084
Please sit down.

422
00:48:59,486 --> 00:49:00,683
Well?

423
00:49:02,278 --> 00:49:04,565
Now this is very difficult
to explain.

424
00:49:04,778 --> 00:49:07,562
There are creatures loose here
and they're dangerous.

425
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,977
What do you mean?
What are they?

426
00:49:10,778 --> 00:49:15,021
We're not sure, but we think they're
due to Dr. Philips' experiments.

427
00:49:15,778 --> 00:49:17,152
What do you mean "creatures"?

428
00:49:17,778 --> 00:49:20,895
I wish I could tell you more,
but we don't know what they are.

429
00:49:21,528 --> 00:49:25,356
- Creatures?
- Doctor, this is a bit hard to take.

430
00:49:26,778 --> 00:49:29,148
I assure you we're not mad.

431
00:49:30,528 --> 00:49:35,102
Dr. Philips', created some kind
of living organism that kills.

432
00:49:37,528 --> 00:49:40,479
That's what happened to Dr. Landers?
Yes.

433
00:49:41,528 --> 00:49:44,692
We'll need your help
if this island is to survive.

434
00:49:45,570 --> 00:49:48,817
- Survive?
- What do you want us to do?

435
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:53,388
First of all, I'll need
ten good men beside yourselves.

436
00:49:53,486 --> 00:49:56,568
- I can find those for you all right.
- Good.

437
00:49:56,778 --> 00:49:59,562
I want all the villagers together
in an hour.

438
00:50:00,153 --> 00:50:01,859
That's short notice.

439
00:50:02,195 --> 00:50:04,648
We can gather
in the meeting hall.

440
00:50:05,070 --> 00:50:07,689
Right. I'll let you know
everything more fully then.

441
00:50:09,445 --> 00:50:13,936
- We'd better tell the Constable.
- I'm sorry, you're late. He's dead.

442
00:50:14,403 --> 00:50:17,070
- The Constable too?
- Yes, and Ian Bellows.

443
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:22,811
You know, we've had
reports of animals dying.

444
00:50:23,028 --> 00:50:25,564
- It seems as if they had no bones.
- Where?

445
00:50:25,778 --> 00:50:28,480
Several places.
In the northern part of the island.

446
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:32,392
- Has anything occurred in the centre?
- No, just north of the centre.

447
00:50:32,611 --> 00:50:34,567
- We haven't time, they're moving.
- How many?

448
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:37,314
We'll explain at the hall,
we must finish these notes.

449
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:39,684
- We'll do as you say.
- Thank you.

450
00:50:39,945 --> 00:50:43,192
- Now they tried experiment 1165...
- Yes.

451
00:50:43,403 --> 00:50:46,899
And if you compare that with 1143,
the results were negative.

452
00:50:57,403 --> 00:51:00,401
Quiet! Quiet, please!

453
00:51:02,695 --> 00:51:05,479
Now, that's all we know
at the moment.

454
00:51:17,570 --> 00:51:21,859
Your attention, please.
I'm Dr. West and this is Dr. Stanley.

455
00:51:22,070 --> 00:51:24,605
We've completed going over
Dr. Philips' notes

456
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:28,944
and I must warn you that we're in
a dangerous situation. Dr. Stanley?

457
00:51:30,653 --> 00:51:33,437
Let me explain what
we've discovered so far.

458
00:51:34,695 --> 00:51:37,183
In order to understand
the nature of cancer,

459
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:40,070
Dr. Philips was trying
to create living cells.

460
00:51:40,778 --> 00:51:43,267
Cells that he hoped
would attack the cancer.

461
00:51:43,736 --> 00:51:48,109
He based this on the carbon atom
which is the basis of all life.

462
00:51:48,361 --> 00:51:49,641
He didn't succeed.

463
00:51:50,486 --> 00:51:54,811
But he probably created a form
of life based on the silicon atom.

464
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:58,524
Now these Silicates,
as we call them, eat animal bone,

465
00:51:59,611 --> 00:52:00,808
human bone.

466
00:52:01,028 --> 00:52:04,228
Dr. Philips' gave life
to some kind of organism,

467
00:52:04,736 --> 00:52:06,727
something we know nothing about.

468
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:11,023
Their external skeletal structure
is tough and resilient.

469
00:52:11,236 --> 00:52:14,519
We couldn't hurt it with an axe and
when run over, it was unharmed.

470
00:52:16,153 --> 00:52:19,021
We haven't found
a way to destroy them yet,

471
00:52:19,236 --> 00:52:21,310
but shall attack them
with everything we can.

472
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,234
From Dr. Philips' notes
and our own experience,

473
00:52:25,445 --> 00:52:28,561
we calculate that these creatures
divide every six hours.

474
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,900
There are about 64 silicates
on the island at this moment.

475
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:35,682
There'll be 128
by six o'clock this evening.

476
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:40,312
- 256 by midnight.
- What?

477
00:52:40,695 --> 00:52:44,771
And if this continues, at the end
of the week, there'll be a million.

478
00:52:46,236 --> 00:52:49,187
Please, I must have your attention!

479
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:53,979
The only way to stop them if all
else fails, is to deny them food.

480
00:52:54,195 --> 00:52:56,766
We want you to move
into this building with supplies,

481
00:52:56,986 --> 00:52:59,143
round up the cattle
and bring it here.

482
00:53:01,611 --> 00:53:03,069
We must keep calm.

483
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:06,857
Fear and panic will defeat us
just as surely as the Silicates.

484
00:53:07,236 --> 00:53:11,100
We need your help and co-operation.
We must work together.

485
00:53:12,111 --> 00:53:13,273
Thank you.

486
00:53:15,111 --> 00:53:20,065
Right. The following men meet me
in the room out the back there.

487
00:53:20,486 --> 00:53:22,477
Er... Morton...

488
00:53:22,736 --> 00:53:24,229
Er... Dunley...

489
00:53:24,736 --> 00:53:26,857
- Are there any guns on the island?
- Plenty.

490
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,772
- And dynamite?
- I've got three cases.

491
00:53:29,986 --> 00:53:33,103
We ought to make petrol bombs,
we don't know what'll work.

492
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,777
We'll send out three scouts:
Here, here and there.

493
00:53:38,528 --> 00:53:40,400
Dunley, you and two others.

494
00:53:40,903 --> 00:53:44,897
The rest of you gather up
the equipment and meet here.

495
00:53:45,653 --> 00:53:47,857
You all know
the groups assigned to you.

496
00:53:48,486 --> 00:53:50,809
Williams and Martindale,
round up the cattle

497
00:53:51,278 --> 00:53:53,078
and bring them along
to William's field there,

498
00:53:53,361 --> 00:53:54,392
by the village.

499
00:53:55,111 --> 00:53:57,019
Right, let's get moving.

500
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:02,520
Can I rely on you to see
that everything's fine at the hall?

501
00:54:02,736 --> 00:54:04,810
- Yes, of course, I think I can cope.
- Fine.

502
00:54:05,028 --> 00:54:07,232
Now make sure all the supplies
are organised properly

503
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,068
and try and keep them
from panicking.

504
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:11,233
- I will. David...
- Hm?

505
00:54:11,445 --> 00:54:14,359
- Take care.
- I'll do my best.

506
00:54:15,028 --> 00:54:18,524
Don't worry, we'll be back,
whether we destroy them or not.

507
00:54:30,861 --> 00:54:34,807
- How many can you count?
- About 25, as far as I can see.

508
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,854
- Got everything?
- I think so.

509
00:54:43,070 --> 00:54:44,479
- Where's the Geiger counter?
- Why?

510
00:54:44,695 --> 00:54:47,895
If they're radioactive,
we'll have to protect ourselves.

511
00:54:48,111 --> 00:54:49,225
Give us a hand.

512
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:54,773
Halsey,
your group take the dynamite.

513
00:54:54,986 --> 00:54:57,557
Morton, you bring the petrol bombs.

514
00:55:44,570 --> 00:55:46,774
It's no good,
we hit it several times.

515
00:56:02,861 --> 00:56:05,184
They don't seem
to be moving very fast.

516
00:56:06,195 --> 00:56:08,434
I'll cross that one's trail
and get a Geiger reading.

517
00:56:08,653 --> 00:56:11,437
- Careful. Don't get too near.
- Don't worry.

518
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,686
Careful! Behind you!

519
00:56:57,986 --> 00:57:01,020
- Nasty little creatures.
- We better try the petrol bombs.

520
00:57:01,236 --> 00:57:03,357
There wasn't any sign
of radioactivity.

521
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:05,228
That's something, anyway.

522
00:57:07,278 --> 00:57:08,984
The rest of you stay here.

523
00:57:38,861 --> 00:57:42,143
- I'll get up closer.
- All right, but watch it.

524
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:16,229
Try another!

525
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,690
Hey, stop, come back here!

526
00:58:34,361 --> 00:58:36,151
Let's try the dynamite.

527
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:56,687
Right, everybody spread out.

528
00:59:06,153 --> 00:59:07,610
All right, light them up.

529
00:59:55,486 --> 00:59:57,394
Nothing gets through to them.

530
00:59:57,611 --> 01:00:00,100
At this rate, they'll reach the village
by midnight.

531
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,310
What else could we do?

532
01:00:03,403 --> 01:00:05,690
- Starve them.
- Mr. Campbell!

533
01:00:07,153 --> 01:00:10,483
- What is it, Dunley?
- In Parson's Cove...

534
01:00:11,611 --> 01:00:14,811
It's one of the Silicates. It's dead.

535
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:18,272
- Are you sure?
- It hasn't moved in 20 minutes.

536
01:00:19,195 --> 01:00:20,439
And another thing,

537
01:00:20,653 --> 01:00:25,310
that Great Dane of Philips'
is nearby. Half eaten.

538
01:00:26,111 --> 01:00:27,391
Philips' dog!

539
01:00:27,611 --> 01:00:30,396
Remember, the dog
had an overdose of radiation.

540
01:00:30,611 --> 01:00:32,401
Let's have the Geiger counter.

541
01:00:46,861 --> 01:00:49,267
Here it is,
and the dog's over there.

542
01:01:30,486 --> 01:01:32,607
It's loaded with radioactivity.

543
01:01:40,570 --> 01:01:42,062
Radioactive too.

544
01:01:44,129 --> 01:01:47,246
Let's put them on the truck
and take them to the clinic.

545
01:01:57,374 --> 01:01:58,914
Take it round the back!

546
01:02:03,342 --> 01:02:05,826
David, I'm so glad you're here,
they're starting to panic.

547
01:02:06,569 --> 01:02:08,026
All right, take it easy.

548
01:02:10,028 --> 01:02:11,900
Please listen to me.

549
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,308
Will you listen to me, PLEASE!

550
01:02:16,361 --> 01:02:18,897
I've something
of great importance to tell you.

551
01:02:19,486 --> 01:02:22,022
I think we've found a way
to destroy the Silicates.

552
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:24,642
But we'll need the help
of everyone here.

553
01:02:24,861 --> 01:02:28,025
We'll examine a dead one and I think
it'll give us what we need.

554
01:02:28,236 --> 01:02:32,230
Meanwhile, stay here
and do as Miss Merrill says.

555
01:02:33,236 --> 01:02:34,236
Can you stop them?

556
01:02:34,445 --> 01:02:37,645
Keep the people here,
and keep them busy at all costs.

557
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:40,350
- What have you found out?
- I've no time to explain.

558
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:42,774
We'll be in the clinic
if you need us.

559
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:50,602
The outer shell is impenetrable.
We've done everything to pierce it.

560
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:53,059
- But radiation will kill them.
- How?

561
01:02:53,278 --> 01:02:56,975
The dog was contaminated with
strontium, that effects the bone.

562
01:02:57,195 --> 01:02:59,979
It ate the bone plus the strontium,
that's why it died.

563
01:03:00,195 --> 01:03:02,565
How can we introduce the radiation
into their systems?

564
01:03:03,153 --> 01:03:04,183
Can it be done?

565
01:03:04,403 --> 01:03:06,275
Philips' had a supply of isotopes.

566
01:03:06,653 --> 01:03:10,564
If we can get enough Strontium 90,
we can contaminate the cattle.

567
01:03:10,778 --> 01:03:13,445
The Silicates eat the cattle...
It's a hope.

568
01:03:13,653 --> 01:03:17,860
Can you move the cattle closer,
to keep them safe until we're ready?

569
01:03:18,278 --> 01:03:19,984
We can put them
in my cattle yard.

570
01:03:20,403 --> 01:03:23,851
Then do so. Dr. Stanley and I
are going up to Philips' place.

571
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:27,270
Now if we don't come back,
you'll have to get the Strontium 90.

572
01:03:27,486 --> 01:03:30,189
- But we don't know...
- We'll tell you what to do.

573
01:03:47,695 --> 01:03:49,436
Dave, stop the car.

574
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,190
- What is it?
- Look over there. Silicates.

575
01:03:59,861 --> 01:04:01,520
There are more of them.

576
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:36,396
I'm not keen on going down
in that cellar again.

577
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:48,354
It looks safe.

578
01:05:00,903 --> 01:05:05,856
There must be some instrument that
they used to contaminate the animals.

579
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,610
I'll have a look around.

580
01:05:12,570 --> 01:05:15,354
- What about this?
- That's it.

581
01:05:15,653 --> 01:05:17,229
Better put these on.

582
01:08:08,153 --> 01:08:10,440
- I forgot the gloves.
- I'll put this in the car.

583
01:08:53,320 --> 01:08:54,812
David!

584
01:08:56,445 --> 01:08:57,854
David!

585
01:09:14,570 --> 01:09:17,402
- Brian, I...
- You must, you must!

586
01:09:40,053 --> 01:09:41,462
Can you hold that?

587
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:44,960
Keys, in the boot.

588
01:09:56,761 --> 01:09:58,918
Try and hang on
until we get back.

589
01:10:17,345 --> 01:10:19,750
- Thank you, nurse.
- How are you feeling?

590
01:10:20,095 --> 01:10:22,418
- As well as can be expected.
- He's had a lot of pain.

591
01:10:22,636 --> 01:10:25,125
- Not much.
- I'll give you another morphine.

592
01:10:25,345 --> 01:10:29,125
First a sloppy bit of surgery and now
you're turning me into a drug addict.

593
01:10:29,345 --> 01:10:31,335
- It's your choice.
- I don't need it.

594
01:10:31,553 --> 01:10:34,504
All right, but we'll give you
another transfusion.

595
01:10:35,095 --> 01:10:38,046
One more, and I'll be
a full-blooded Irishman.

596
01:10:38,303 --> 01:10:39,760
I think he's feeling better.

597
01:11:20,011 --> 01:11:21,967
- Is that all the cattle?
- That's all.

598
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:25,010
Most of them.
Very few escaped the round-up.

599
01:11:25,428 --> 01:11:27,881
Let's hope
we've got enough Strontium 90.

600
01:11:35,303 --> 01:11:37,045
Herd them through one at a time.

601
01:12:22,970 --> 01:12:24,249
That's the lot.

602
01:12:25,761 --> 01:12:27,835
I had to cut down the shots
on the last few.

603
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:30,542
- Do you think it'll be enough?
- I don't know.

604
01:12:30,845 --> 01:12:33,594
Let's get back,
and get those lights strung up.

605
01:12:34,803 --> 01:12:36,260
You've done it.

606
01:12:36,928 --> 01:12:39,002
- Give us a bulb.
- Here, take this.

607
01:12:40,553 --> 01:12:42,793
Yeah, that's it.

608
01:12:43,470 --> 01:12:45,342
What if it doesn't work?

609
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,799
Then we'll just have to
wait for help.

610
01:12:49,011 --> 01:12:52,377
Our biggest worry is that they'll
panic. They must understand.

611
01:12:52,803 --> 01:12:55,422
They're scared to death...
So am I.

612
01:12:55,636 --> 01:12:58,421
We're all scared. If they go
outside, it's certain death.

613
01:12:58,636 --> 01:13:00,674
Those things will be
all over the building.

614
01:13:00,886 --> 01:13:02,842
Probably.
Now, look,

615
01:13:03,053 --> 01:13:05,542
you must keep the people
calm, they trust you.

616
01:13:05,761 --> 01:13:07,089
I'll do my best.

617
01:13:13,178 --> 01:13:15,465
The lights are a strain
on the generator.

618
01:13:15,678 --> 01:13:19,174
- That'd really cause a panic.
- I've got torches and candles.

619
01:13:19,386 --> 01:13:22,752
- I hope we don't need them.
- We've food for a week.

620
01:13:22,970 --> 01:13:24,795
You must convince the villagers.

621
01:13:25,011 --> 01:13:28,673
Our one hope is that they'll starve
if the Strontium doesn't work,

622
01:13:28,886 --> 01:13:31,719
or at least the lack of food
may cut down the multiplication.

623
01:13:31,928 --> 01:13:35,376
- Are you going to have a look?
- Yes, but first I'll see Stanley.

624
01:13:35,678 --> 01:13:37,550
I'll talk to the people.

625
01:13:37,845 --> 01:13:40,712
You move around amongst them
and keep them occupied.

626
01:13:40,928 --> 01:13:43,168
Get help from Dunley
and some of the others.

627
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:44,630
Good.

628
01:13:44,928 --> 01:13:49,135
I've injected the cattle but
we ran short of the Strontium 90.

629
01:13:49,428 --> 01:13:51,300
I had to cut down
on the last few.

630
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:55,884
If it doesn't work, we'll wait until
the helicopter or boat arrives.

631
01:13:56,345 --> 01:14:00,421
- When will the Silicates get here?
- It's a little after ten.

632
01:14:00,761 --> 01:14:03,759
According to the last positions,
in about an hour and a half.

633
01:14:03,970 --> 01:14:05,711
What about the division time?

634
01:14:06,511 --> 01:14:10,505
That may take some time
and there aren't that many cattle.

635
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,338
You get some rest.

636
01:14:12,761 --> 01:14:14,468
A perfect time for a nap.

637
01:14:14,678 --> 01:14:17,878
You will let me know if anything
unusual happens, won't you?

638
01:14:19,761 --> 01:14:21,302
We've got to get out of here.

639
01:14:21,553 --> 01:14:25,132
Where can we go?
We can't reach the mainland.

640
01:14:25,553 --> 01:14:28,504
If you'd seen what it did to Archie,
you'd swim.

641
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:29,881
Halsey!

642
01:14:30,928 --> 01:14:32,551
Shut up.

643
01:14:33,095 --> 01:14:34,588
Listen all of you,

644
01:14:35,178 --> 01:14:38,010
if anyone leaves this building,
they'll be killed for sure.

645
01:14:38,220 --> 01:14:42,000
We're safe enough in here, we've got
enough food and water to wait.

646
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:44,258
I'm so frightened, Mr. Campbell.

647
01:14:44,470 --> 01:14:47,136
If you do as we say,
you've nothing to fear.

648
01:14:47,345 --> 01:14:49,217
- Will you trust me?
- Yes.

649
01:14:51,845 --> 01:14:54,464
Now, listen, Halsey,
and listen well.

650
01:14:54,845 --> 01:14:59,668
If I hear another sound out of you,
I'll throw you out for those things.

651
01:14:59,886 --> 01:15:01,794
I'm talking straight,
understand?

652
01:15:02,011 --> 01:15:05,175
- Mr. Campbell, I can't stand it...
- Do you understand?

653
01:15:05,636 --> 01:15:07,177
Mind that you do.

654
01:15:08,678 --> 01:15:12,838
There's nothing to fear. We'll be
all right as long as we stay here.

655
01:15:13,053 --> 01:15:15,008
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

656
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,969
Why, I've stuffed this place
with supplies on credit.

657
01:15:20,303 --> 01:15:22,424
He's a much better colour,
he'll rest now.

658
01:15:22,761 --> 01:15:24,005
Now what?

659
01:15:24,345 --> 01:15:28,469
- I think you could use some rest too.
- I suppose we all could.

660
01:15:28,678 --> 01:15:32,293
- Why don't you go and lie down?
- I'd rather not, not now.

661
01:15:32,803 --> 01:15:34,296
- David?
- Hm?

662
01:15:34,595 --> 01:15:36,881
Do you really think
we'll get out of this?

663
01:15:37,928 --> 01:15:42,088
Well, I think we stand
a very good chance, yes.

664
01:15:42,595 --> 01:15:44,716
But you don't believe that, do you?

665
01:15:47,803 --> 01:15:50,374
Not 100%, no,
but I'd like to believe it.

666
01:15:50,595 --> 01:15:51,839
Toni?

667
01:15:54,261 --> 01:15:57,461
I've never been...
I've never been much good at...

668
01:15:58,220 --> 01:16:01,134
At being serious with a woman
before now, but...

669
01:16:01,345 --> 01:16:03,419
If we get out of this, I will...

670
01:16:05,345 --> 01:16:09,090
Don't say anything more.
Not here, not now.

671
01:16:11,428 --> 01:16:13,751
Yes, I'd better get outside,
it's nearly midnight.

672
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:16,672
David, be careful,

673
01:16:17,720 --> 01:16:19,260
I love you.

674
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,960
The cattle are getting restless.

675
01:16:44,095 --> 01:16:46,666
Aye, they're moving around a lot.

676
01:16:49,886 --> 01:16:53,797
- How are the people taking things?
- I think it'll be all right.

677
01:16:54,011 --> 01:16:57,258
- The boys are keeping the talk going.
- Good.

678
01:17:05,738 --> 01:17:07,396
How many, do you think?

679
01:17:08,136 --> 01:17:10,008
Hard to tell. About 100.

680
01:17:10,803 --> 01:17:14,003
- So they didn't divide.
- It doesn't look like it.

681
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:21,124
Well, this is it.

682
01:17:21,886 --> 01:17:23,509
It's a nightmare.

683
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:30,333
It's all over.

684
01:17:33,345 --> 01:17:35,086
They're coming this way!

685
01:17:39,595 --> 01:17:41,502
- Not stopping.
- No.

686
01:17:41,761 --> 01:17:44,215
- Good Lord, look!
- They're dividing.

687
01:17:46,053 --> 01:17:48,458
That means the effect
of the Strontium will be halved.

688
01:17:48,678 --> 01:17:51,676
- I'd hoped it'd work before then.
- Let's get inside.

689
01:18:03,136 --> 01:18:05,672
Tell them it may take time
to work.

690
01:18:05,886 --> 01:18:08,340
- Will it work?
- I wish I knew.

691
01:18:18,061 --> 01:18:21,344
- Brian, they've divided.
- What does that mean?

692
01:18:21,561 --> 01:18:24,974
That the power and effect of
the Strontium is cut in half.

693
01:18:25,186 --> 01:18:28,054
Did they divide before
or after they ate the cattle?

694
01:18:28,270 --> 01:18:30,260
- After.
- That's something.

695
01:18:30,478 --> 01:18:33,410
- Not much, but it's something.
- How's your arm?

696
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,692
I'm trying not to think about it.

697
01:18:36,233 --> 01:18:38,852
It may take time
for the Strontium to work.

698
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:40,847
If it works.

699
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:55,508
- I don't like this.
- The generator's had it.

700
01:18:55,728 --> 01:18:57,766
- They're coming.
- I can hear.

701
01:18:58,020 --> 01:18:59,560
I'd better talk to them.

702
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:02,977
- Quiet everyone!
- Hold it!

703
01:19:03,186 --> 01:19:05,757
- Please try and be quiet!
- Now don't panic.

704
01:19:05,978 --> 01:19:09,260
We expected them here.
We must give it time to work.

705
01:19:14,103 --> 01:19:16,094
Light the candles and lanterns.

706
01:19:19,270 --> 01:19:21,260
Take it easy! Take it easy!

707
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,475
Quiet, please. Quiet.

708
01:19:24,145 --> 01:19:26,468
They're frightened without the light.

709
01:19:26,686 --> 01:19:28,393
- If they start breaking out.
- I know.

710
01:19:28,603 --> 01:19:30,677
Come on, we've got a job to do.

711
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:36,474
- What's happened to the lights?
- Quiet!

712
01:19:37,103 --> 01:19:39,141
Be careful,
they're panicking as it is.

713
01:19:39,353 --> 01:19:42,102
- I'm sorry.
- We've got to set an example.

714
01:19:53,853 --> 01:19:55,227
I'm not staying here.

715
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:02,556
I'll shoot anyone that moves,
I mean it.

716
01:20:03,145 --> 01:20:04,638
I'll shoot anyone that moves.

717
01:20:05,270 --> 01:20:08,801
Get back to your places,
away from the windows and the door.

718
01:20:17,978 --> 01:20:19,387
Look out!

719
01:20:43,228 --> 01:20:45,633
Get to the clinic,
as many as you can!

720
01:20:49,936 --> 01:20:51,761
Open the door!

721
01:20:53,353 --> 01:20:56,138
They're breaking in.
Take care of her, I'll be back.

722
01:20:56,353 --> 01:20:57,353
Wait!

723
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,806
Come on, quickly, block it!

724
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:05,010
Quick, bring anything you can!

725
01:21:05,228 --> 01:21:07,349
Quickly, bring it over here!

726
01:21:08,145 --> 01:21:11,925
- Hold on.
- I'm trying, but I'm so frightened.

727
01:21:13,103 --> 01:21:14,265
I'm frightened.

728
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:33,178
No place else to go.

729
01:22:27,353 --> 01:22:29,225
Hold it, they're getting weaker.

730
01:23:04,936 --> 01:23:06,264
Careful.

731
01:23:15,478 --> 01:23:17,350
Give me a hand with this.

732
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:05,098
They're dead.

733
01:24:06,436 --> 01:24:09,636
- Oh, David!
- Darling, it's all over.

734
01:24:09,853 --> 01:24:11,511
We're all right now.

735
01:24:12,686 --> 01:24:16,218
- And now my hand itches.
- Oh, shut up, Brian.

736
01:24:16,686 --> 01:24:19,471
Watch it, or I'll sue you
for malpractice.

737
01:24:26,936 --> 01:24:29,639
As soon as we get on,
we'll radio ahead for aid.

738
01:24:29,853 --> 01:24:32,520
We'll need a lot of help to clean up
the island, bury the dead.

739
01:24:32,728 --> 01:24:34,932
They'll send everything,
this afternoon.

740
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,676
I wish Philips'
had never started this.

741
01:24:37,895 --> 01:24:40,466
No, he was just trying
to help humanity.

742
01:24:40,686 --> 01:24:44,976
Science has its risks, but they
aren't enough to hinder progress.

743
01:24:45,561 --> 01:24:49,141
- Have you searched the island?
- Yes, several times.

744
01:24:49,353 --> 01:24:50,929
We killed them all, I'm certain.

745
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:24,677
I shudder to think of them.

746
01:25:24,895 --> 01:25:27,809
Don't think about them, just try
to get them out of your mind.

747
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:30,306
- It's easier said than done.
- I know.

748
01:25:30,811 --> 01:25:34,343
- What'll happen to the villagers?
- We'll send back help.

749
01:25:35,186 --> 01:25:37,391
You know, we were lucky
this is an island.

750
01:25:37,895 --> 01:25:41,935
If it had happened anywhere else,
I doubt we would've destroyed them.
