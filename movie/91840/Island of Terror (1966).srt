1
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,584
Steady as you go.

2
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:28,087
Steady now, steady.

3
00:00:29,255 --> 00:00:30,922
All right,
let's have it on the truck.

4
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:38,926
Is that all they need?

5
00:00:39,093 --> 00:00:42,428
Yes, I think so. How long
will it take to fill the order?

6
00:00:42,595 --> 00:00:45,430
- Probably 3 to 4 weeks.
- We need a better service.

7
00:00:45,596 --> 00:00:47,431
A boat once a week
isn't enough.

8
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:49,765
At least they could
install telephones.

9
00:00:49,932 --> 00:00:52,683
- Yes. They promised them this year.
- Yes, and last.

10
00:00:53,767 --> 00:00:56,018
- Morning, Campbell, Peter, Ian.
- Morning, Dr. Landers.

11
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:57,769
I'd like to mail these people.

12
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,037
More books?

13
00:00:59,103 --> 00:01:01,771
You islanders are too hardy.
I have to keep busy.

14
00:01:02,021 --> 00:01:04,189
You know, you and I
should take up chess.

15
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:06,107
I've nothing to do either,
except when Andy McCracken

16
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,692
has a drop too much
and tries to brig up the pub.

17
00:01:09,025 --> 00:01:11,443
Why not try talking
to Dr Phillips over there?

18
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:27,951
He doesn't like company. That's why
he picked this isolated place.

19
00:01:28,201 --> 00:01:29,369
No contact with the mainland.

20
00:01:29,535 --> 00:01:31,536
- He's an odd one.
- Not really,

21
00:01:31,787 --> 00:01:33,704
he's one of the top
research men in the worid.

22
00:01:33,871 --> 00:01:37,039
- Researchers are like that.
- We wouldn't mind a bit of contact.

23
00:01:37,706 --> 00:01:40,124
They don't care about us,
we don't pay enough taxes.

24
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,209
- Right, Constable?
- Speak for yourself, Ian.

25
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,545
- It smells like fog.
- I think it'll be a lovely evening.

26
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:49,546
If you weren't a newcomer,
you'd feel it.

27
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:51,547
A newcomer!
I've been here for ten years.

28
00:01:51,713 --> 00:01:53,548
A newcomer just the same.

29
00:02:21,145 --> 00:02:22,229
Good.

30
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:25,231
The cell cultures are prepared,
we can begin.

31
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:28,566
Are we going ahead without hearing
from Rome, New York, Tokio?

32
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:32,234
I've mailed them full reports.
They'll start when they get them.

33
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:34,652
The potential across the cell
membrane must be maintained

34
00:02:34,902 --> 00:02:36,570
during the radiation of the nucleus.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,654
- Is the tritium state complete?
- Yes.

36
00:02:38,821 --> 00:02:41,155
- And the vapour applicator?
- It's been corrected.

37
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:44,240
- The connect problem has been solved.
- Good.

38
00:02:44,907 --> 00:02:46,575
Now we've received
the infusion equipment,

39
00:02:46,742 --> 00:02:49,493
I'm certain they'll understand
my reasons for going ahead.

40
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,744
I've waited
a long time for this moment.

41
00:02:52,244 --> 00:02:55,829
If we're successful today, it may
well be we have the cure for cancer.

42
00:05:30,825 --> 00:05:32,326
- Mrs. Bellows, come in.
- Thank you.

43
00:05:32,576 --> 00:05:34,077
Go over there by the fire.

44
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:37,412
- What brings you here?
- I'm so sorry to bother you,

45
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:39,830
but I'm worried about Ian.
He hasn't come home.

46
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:42,414
- Sit down. I'll get you some tea.
- No, thank you.

47
00:05:42,665 --> 00:05:44,916
Now settle down,
and tell me all about it.

48
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:49,001
Lan hasn't come home, he's three
hours late and that isn't like him.

49
00:05:49,168 --> 00:05:50,419
I'm afraid something's happened.

50
00:05:51,086 --> 00:05:53,253
I'm sure it's nothing.
Did you try the pub?

51
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:56,088
They haven't seen him.
I've been all round the village.

52
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,256
I'll tell you what,
I'll look for him,

53
00:05:58,423 --> 00:06:00,007
you go home
and I'll bring him.

54
00:06:00,674 --> 00:06:03,842
- Do you think he's had an accident?
- No, I'm sure everything's all right.

55
00:06:04,009 --> 00:06:06,177
I'll take a look at your north
field near Philips' house.

56
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,094
Go on home
and don't worry.

57
00:06:08,261 --> 00:06:11,262
I'll do as you say.
Sorry for being a nuisance.

58
00:06:11,429 --> 00:06:14,514
- That's what I'm here for.
- Thank you very much indeed.

59
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:39,110
Lan!

60
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,529
Lan Bellows!

61
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:03,623
Lan!

62
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:09,990
Doctor Landers!

63
00:08:13,408 --> 00:08:14,826
- Thank God.
- You're in a state.

64
00:08:14,992 --> 00:08:17,077
- I am.
- Come in.

65
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,662
Sit over there.

66
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,247
Now, tell me, what's happened?

67
00:08:25,414 --> 00:08:29,250
Now, listen. I'm not a man
that's easily shaken, Doctor.

68
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,334
- I know. Would you like a drink?
- No, no.

69
00:08:32,751 --> 00:08:35,753
I've just seen something
and by all that's holy,

70
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,754
I just can't be sure,
but I think it's Ian Bellows.

71
00:08:39,505 --> 00:08:41,256
You think it's Ian?
What's happened?

72
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:45,341
I don't know,
his body is all like jelly.

73
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:49,593
- Jelly!
- Aye. Like nothing I've ever seen.

74
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:55,513
There was no face just a horrible
mush with the eyes sitting in it.

75
00:08:56,347 --> 00:08:57,514
Where did this happen?

76
00:08:58,348 --> 00:09:01,599
Up near the peninsula,
on the path to Parson's Cove.

77
00:09:02,183 --> 00:09:05,268
- Did anyone else see it?
- No, no, I don't think so.

78
00:09:06,935 --> 00:09:09,937
Come on, I'll get my hat and coat.
We'll go over there.

79
00:09:15,356 --> 00:09:17,608
It's a body,
but I can't recognise it.

80
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,359
- Those are Ian Bellow's clothes.
- Yes.

81
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:23,527
- What's happened to him?
- I don't know.

82
00:09:23,694 --> 00:09:26,946
As far as I can tell, the body
doesn't seem to have any bones.

83
00:09:27,446 --> 00:09:28,530
No bones?

84
00:09:32,032 --> 00:09:33,115
Look.

85
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,201
You see.

86
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,536
I have to make a closer examination.
Let's get it back to the village.

87
00:09:40,703 --> 00:09:43,537
- I'll get something to carry it on.
- I'll wait here.

88
00:09:46,205 --> 00:09:47,539
Hurry up, will you?

89
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:57,628
It's definitely Ian. I recognised
the appendectomy scar and birth mark.

90
00:09:57,795 --> 00:10:00,213
My God.
What will I tell Mrs. Bellows?

91
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:03,131
I'll come with you and give her
a sedative. She'll need it.

92
00:10:04,882 --> 00:10:07,383
Don't mention the condition
of the body.

93
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,884
Of course not. I understand.

94
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,552
In fact, I don't want
this mentioned to anyone.

95
00:10:11,802 --> 00:10:13,636
They'll have to know soon enough.

96
00:10:13,803 --> 00:10:15,887
Not until I find out
what we're dealing with.

97
00:10:16,304 --> 00:10:17,722
What are you going to do?

98
00:10:18,389 --> 00:10:20,890
First, I'll go and see Phillips,
I need expert help.

99
00:10:21,057 --> 00:10:24,558
- This is quite beyond my knowledge.
- What if he won't help, or can't?

100
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:27,477
I'll take the emergency launch and
visit Brian Stanley in London.

101
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,812
That's our only contact with
the mainland in case we need help.

102
00:10:30,978 --> 00:10:32,813
Don't worry,
I'll come back immediately.

103
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:34,313
Who is this Brian Stanley?

104
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,815
He's the most eminent
pathologist in Britain.

105
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:41,150
Whatever this disease is, it's
virulent and could be contagious.

106
00:10:41,567 --> 00:10:45,569
We might fly back, so build
a signal fire on Moor Heights.

107
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:54,073
That'll be all for today, gentlemen.

108
00:10:54,324 --> 00:10:55,407
I...

109
00:10:55,574 --> 00:10:58,326
I do hope some of what
I've been saying has penetrated.

110
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,328
From your last papers, I doubt if
you'll progress beyond first aid.

111
00:11:02,494 --> 00:11:03,495
Good day.

112
00:11:11,582 --> 00:11:13,000
- Oh, Dr. Stanley.
- Yes?

113
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:16,168
- This is Dr. Landers.
- Yes, I heard your telephone message.

114
00:11:16,335 --> 00:11:19,336
- How do you do? Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

115
00:11:20,003 --> 00:11:22,254
I practice on Peter's Island.
- Where's that?

116
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:25,256
- Off the East coast of Ireland.
- And what can I do for you?

117
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,175
Do you know of any disease
that could dissolve human bone?

118
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,759
No, I don't. Why?

119
00:11:32,343 --> 00:11:34,594
We've discovered a body
without any trace of bone in it.

120
00:11:35,845 --> 00:11:39,180
- No bone? Are you certain?
- Quite certain.

121
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:41,348
That's unbelievable!

122
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:45,766
- Have you heard this before?
- Nothing even remotely like it.

123
00:11:46,517 --> 00:11:48,268
I was hoping you could help me.

124
00:11:48,851 --> 00:11:51,686
- There was no trace of bone?
- None.

125
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:53,687
If that's true, it's beyond me.

126
00:11:54,104 --> 00:11:56,105
It's true.
I performed a complete autopsy.

127
00:12:02,275 --> 00:12:04,109
- Have you heard of David West?
- I think so.

128
00:12:04,276 --> 00:12:06,777
He's the most qualified man
on bone disease I know.

129
00:12:06,944 --> 00:12:10,612
Let's try the Medical Library first,
then we'll go and see David.

130
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,030
- If you think he'll help.
- If anyone can, he can.

131
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,291
I couldn't find your bathrobe.

132
00:12:33,624 --> 00:12:36,042
I'm sure you don't find the female
anatomy shocking.

133
00:12:36,209 --> 00:12:37,960
It's different from Harley St.
How's your dress?

134
00:12:38,126 --> 00:12:41,378
The spot's out,
but it'll take some time to dry.

135
00:12:41,545 --> 00:12:44,546
- Cured beautifully, don't you think?
- The credit isn't all mine.

136
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,881
- Excellent cognac, David.
- From an expert, that's a compliment.

137
00:12:48,048 --> 00:12:51,050
You shouldn't believe everything
you read, they exaggerate.

138
00:12:51,216 --> 00:12:53,301
Everything about you
is exaggerated.

139
00:12:53,468 --> 00:12:56,052
You're too charming. To think
I had to break a leg to meet you.

140
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:58,387
And write off a very expensive
Maserati.

141
00:12:58,554 --> 00:13:01,472
Not every girl goes to such lengths
to meet a man.

142
00:13:01,638 --> 00:13:03,806
Besides, I'm sure it's going
to be worth it, isn't it?

143
00:13:03,973 --> 00:13:06,141
I may not get to places
as fast as a Maserati.

144
00:13:06,308 --> 00:13:08,809
- But you do get there eventually.
- Eventually.

145
00:13:08,976 --> 00:13:10,310
- When?
- I'll let you know.

146
00:13:10,476 --> 00:13:14,145
Don't take too long. You might
run out of petrol on the last lap.

147
00:13:19,898 --> 00:13:22,482
- A pitstop or the checkered flag?
- I don't know.

148
00:13:22,983 --> 00:13:25,651
But in the meantime, my dressing gown
is in the bathroom.

149
00:13:32,404 --> 00:13:33,988
Brian, what do you want
at this time?

150
00:13:34,155 --> 00:13:36,490
Good evening, David. I hope
we're interrupting something.

151
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:39,241
- May I present Dr. Reginald Landers.
- How do you do?

152
00:13:39,408 --> 00:13:41,409
He's brought you
an interesting problem.

153
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:44,660
Yes. I've already got
an interesting problem for tonight.

154
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:47,579
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

155
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,663
We are interrupting.

156
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,665
Miss Toni Merrill, may I introduce
Dr. Stanley and Dr. Landers.

157
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,166
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

158
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:56,667
Excuse my dress.

159
00:13:56,833 --> 00:14:00,752
David is better with a scalpel
that he is opening a bottle of wine.

160
00:14:01,669 --> 00:14:04,420
Reginald practices on some
little island off the Irish coast.

161
00:14:04,587 --> 00:14:07,005
He's found a body
without any trace of bone.

162
00:14:08,589 --> 00:14:10,674
No bones? Yes, of course,
this is quite a common...

163
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,008
- I'm serious, doctor.
- I'm sorry, doctor.

164
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:16,427
I wasn't implying any lack of ability,
but it's difficult to accept.

165
00:14:16,593 --> 00:14:18,845
- I can show you the body.
- He did a complete autopsy.

166
00:14:19,928 --> 00:14:21,929
- No bones?
- No bones.

167
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:25,765
- Any contusions or lacerations?
- Not a trace.

168
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,349
That's why we're tossing it
into your lap.

169
00:14:28,516 --> 00:14:31,184
I hate to disappoint you, but I've
never heard of anything like this.

170
00:14:32,435 --> 00:14:33,519
What was the medical history?

171
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:36,270
Practically no medical history.
He was a strong, healthy farmer.

172
00:14:36,437 --> 00:14:39,188
- Interesting problem, eh?
- Very. I'd like to see the body.

173
00:14:39,522 --> 00:14:41,940
I was going to have a look
at it myself. Like to come?

174
00:14:42,106 --> 00:14:43,190
- Yes.
- Good.

175
00:14:43,357 --> 00:14:45,441
I'm sure they'll call it
"West's Disease".

176
00:14:45,608 --> 00:14:47,526
This sudden humility
astounds me!

177
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:49,944
They've named so many after me,
it'll cause confusion.

178
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:53,445
- When are you leaving?
- Tonight. We'll need a plane.

179
00:14:53,946 --> 00:14:56,364
- You could use my father's plane.
- We need a sea plane.

180
00:14:56,614 --> 00:14:58,115
- It's a helicopter.
- That's nice of you, Toni.

181
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:00,199
- There's a catch.
- I should've known.

182
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,784
- I'm going with you.
- We don't know what we're up against.

183
00:15:03,117 --> 00:15:06,035
It's an unknown disease,
we can't anticipate the effects.

184
00:15:06,619 --> 00:15:07,870
Nevertheless, I'm going.

185
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,871
- Time is important.
- Quite so, quite.

186
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,539
Yes, I know.

187
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,540
Very well, we accept
your offer and the condition.

188
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,041
If you'll excuse me,
I'll telephone my father.

189
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:22,210
We'll stop by my lab
and pick up some equipment.

190
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:25,462
I can't wait for you. Your father
needs the helicopter.

191
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,213
That's all right, is it?

192
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,463
We don't have much choice.

193
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:30,965
I'll come back in a couple
of days.

194
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:33,966
- Right.
- We'll be marooned on the island.

195
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,718
We won't have any contact
with the mainland.

196
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:38,802
I can't take
the emergency launch back.

197
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,887
It's too late for other arrangements.
We'll have to make do.

198
00:15:42,054 --> 00:15:44,555
I had no idea my father
would need the helicopter.

199
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:47,140
What did Napoleon do on that island
of his to him busy?

200
00:15:47,306 --> 00:15:48,724
He invented solitaire.

201
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,642
- I've a much better game in mind.
- Can three play?

202
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:54,643
Fascinating game, solitaire.

203
00:17:43,449 --> 00:17:46,200
- Hello, John. How's Mrs. Bellows?
- Those pills did the trick.

204
00:17:46,367 --> 00:17:47,368
Good.

205
00:17:47,701 --> 00:17:50,036
Constable Harris,
may I introduce Dr. Stanley,

206
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:52,287
- Miss Merrill and Dr. West.
- How do you do?

207
00:17:52,453 --> 00:17:54,454
- Does anybody know about Ian?
- No.

208
00:17:54,621 --> 00:17:57,289
- Have you been in touch with Philips?
- No, he's not been down.

209
00:17:57,456 --> 00:17:59,374
Philips?
Dr. Lawrence Philips.

210
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,458
Oh, Dr. Philips!
What's he doing out here?

211
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:04,460
- This is where he set up his lab.
- He could be of great help.

212
00:18:04,626 --> 00:18:06,877
You've got to get to him first.
He's a recluse.

213
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:08,795
Who is he?
What does he do?

214
00:18:08,962 --> 00:18:10,379
Top man in cancer research.

215
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:12,630
Before we do anything,
let's see that body.

216
00:18:17,466 --> 00:18:18,967
Not a very pretty sight.

217
00:18:28,055 --> 00:18:30,556
I intend to make
the first incision here. Agreed?

218
00:18:30,723 --> 00:18:31,723
Agreed.

219
00:18:42,312 --> 00:18:43,896
Here's something interesting.

220
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:48,649
There are a series of minute
punctures in this dermal segment.

221
00:18:49,649 --> 00:18:50,650
That's odd.

222
00:18:50,817 --> 00:18:52,567
Let's collect segments
from other parts of the body.

223
00:18:52,734 --> 00:18:54,652
Try staining it with eosin.

224
00:19:00,905 --> 00:19:03,656
- It's the same with all of them.
- They're all over the body.

225
00:19:03,823 --> 00:19:05,991
I've never seen anything
like these punctures before.

226
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:08,409
Could something have entered
the body through them?

227
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:11,244
- Like what, for instance?
- It's possible some enzyme

228
00:19:11,410 --> 00:19:13,245
was introduced into the body
through the punctures.

229
00:19:13,411 --> 00:19:17,247
If they are punctures. I can't tell
if they're punctures or ruptures.

230
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:20,915
Something came out or some organism
producing an enzyme went in.

231
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:23,917
There's no trace of calcium
phosphate in the body.

232
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,585
Then this enzyme,
or whatever it is,

233
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:29,336
seems to attack and break down
the calcium phosphate.

234
00:19:29,503 --> 00:19:31,921
A major component of human bone.

235
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,839
We don't know
if there's a connection

236
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:36,256
between the perforations
and the absence of bone.

237
00:19:36,423 --> 00:19:38,758
They could be two evidences
of a similar syndrome.

238
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:40,592
We'll have to assume it.

239
00:19:40,759 --> 00:19:42,843
If we only had more complete
facilities.

240
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:45,595
There's Philips' lab,
but I don't know if he'll talk to us.

241
00:19:46,428 --> 00:19:48,263
- He'll talk to me.
- How well equipped is he?

242
00:19:48,429 --> 00:19:50,764
I've never seen it,
but I believe it's complete.

243
00:19:51,764 --> 00:19:53,432
Don't say the lights
are going to fail.

244
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,349
We've had trouble
with the generator.

245
00:19:55,516 --> 00:19:57,601
- Let's get out to Philips' place.
- All right.

246
00:19:57,851 --> 00:20:00,769
I'd better leave a note
for Constable Harris at his house.

247
00:20:10,857 --> 00:20:13,109
What a climate!
How do they stay healthy?

248
00:20:13,859 --> 00:20:15,693
Does that generator supply
all this island?

249
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:19,028
All the electrical power. I've been
after them for months to fix it.

250
00:20:19,445 --> 00:20:21,780
- Is that the house up there?
- That's it.

251
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:24,281
Good Lord, it looks like
"Wuthering Heights".

252
00:20:46,376 --> 00:20:47,710
Try again.

253
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:50,961
I don't think it'll do much good.

254
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,297
We must get into that lab somehow.

255
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:58,298
- I'll look around. Got a torch?
- Yes, I have.

256
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,467
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

257
00:21:02,717 --> 00:21:04,802
Wait here.
I'll find a way in.

258
00:22:50,522 --> 00:22:52,773
- I've found another body.
- The same as the other?

259
00:23:02,528 --> 00:23:05,446
- Where's the laboratory?
- I don't know. I've never been here.

260
00:23:05,613 --> 00:23:06,630
We'll find it.

261
00:23:18,036 --> 00:23:19,620
Let's try down here!

262
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,886
Isotopes. He's got as much equipment
here as I have at the University.

263
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:54,055
There's the lab.

264
00:24:14,482 --> 00:24:16,149
There's one over here, as well.

265
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:22,402
Were there signs of a struggle
with Bellows?

266
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:24,654
You couldn't tell,
it was in a cave.

267
00:24:24,987 --> 00:24:28,072
Philips had no contact in the village.
It's not a contagious disease.

268
00:24:28,322 --> 00:24:30,740
Whatever it was,
it must've started in this lab.

269
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:32,491
Bellows' body was found
not far away.

270
00:24:32,658 --> 00:24:35,826
If it did start here, it might be
moving down towards the village.

271
00:24:35,993 --> 00:24:37,994
Well, they were either fighting
something,

272
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,078
or the death throes
were violent.

273
00:24:40,662 --> 00:24:42,579
Why don't we study
Philips' notes?

274
00:24:42,746 --> 00:24:45,247
- It could give us a lead.
- All right.

275
00:25:37,191 --> 00:25:39,275
All right, hold on, I'm coming!

276
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,694
Come in, you're in time for tea.

277
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:48,279
John, I found one of my horses dead.

278
00:25:48,446 --> 00:25:51,948
At least I think it's one of
my horses, it's all soft and flabby.

279
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:55,617
- Where did it happen?
- In my field.

280
00:25:56,367 --> 00:25:58,034
I've got to tell Dr. Landers.

281
00:25:58,201 --> 00:26:00,286
He's at Philips' place,
according to this note.

282
00:26:00,452 --> 00:26:02,037
Then I'll take a look
at your horse.

283
00:26:02,203 --> 00:26:05,205
- Don't mention this to anyone.
- Why not?

284
00:26:05,372 --> 00:26:08,540
Don't ask foolish questions,
do as I say. Now, go on.

285
00:26:08,707 --> 00:26:10,624
I'll let you know everything
in a while.

286
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:21,463
You get started,
I'll tell Harris we're back.

287
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:23,381
Right. Meet us here,
we've a lot to read.

288
00:26:23,547 --> 00:26:24,798
I'll be back shortly.

289
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,717
I could do with food and coffee.
It's been a hard day.

290
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:05,819
Doctor Landers?

291
00:27:20,577 --> 00:27:21,911
Doctor Landers?

292
00:27:43,755 --> 00:27:45,256
Doctor Landers!

293
00:28:08,017 --> 00:28:09,268
Doctor Landers?

294
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:39,481
It was a horrible
looking mess.

295
00:29:39,981 --> 00:29:41,065
- Good morning, doctor.
- Morning.

296
00:29:41,232 --> 00:29:44,150
- Has anyone seen Constable Harris?
- He said he'd meet you at Philips'.

297
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:46,484
He's gone up to my fields
to look at my horse.

298
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:48,735
- What's that?
- He's gone to Philips' place.

299
00:29:48,902 --> 00:29:50,820
My horse is dead
and he's gone up there.

300
00:29:50,987 --> 00:29:53,738
- What happened to your horse?
- If it is my horse.

301
00:29:54,072 --> 00:29:56,156
It's a bloody mess,
a pile of flesh.

302
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:58,407
- In your fields?
- Yes.

303
00:29:59,491 --> 00:30:02,076
- The other side of the island...
- Pardon?

304
00:30:02,242 --> 00:30:04,660
Nothing. Excuse me,
I've got to go.

305
00:30:04,827 --> 00:30:07,412
- Wait, what's going on here?
- I can't explain now.

306
00:30:08,496 --> 00:30:11,247
Some peculiar goings on
on this island.

307
00:30:12,164 --> 00:30:14,415
It was a bit abrupt
on the doctor's part.

308
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:18,751
He may be right.
I'll go and see Campbell.

309
00:30:27,505 --> 00:30:30,340
You're the head of the island,
what do you plan to do?

310
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:32,341
It's no good dithering about.

311
00:30:32,508 --> 00:30:35,676
We better go and talk to the farmers
and then see Dr. Landers.

312
00:30:43,513 --> 00:30:46,515
A farmer has found his horse
on the other side of the peninsula.

313
00:30:46,848 --> 00:30:50,267
Harris has gone to Philips' place.
We must've just missed him.

314
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,685
- Did you find anything?
- Philips was doing cancer research.

315
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:57,604
He was creating a form of living
matter to counteract the cancer.

316
00:30:57,771 --> 00:30:58,771
What do you think?

317
00:30:58,938 --> 00:31:02,106
He might've succeeded in creating
some form of life in his lair.

318
00:31:02,273 --> 00:31:04,858
- That caused these deaths?
- We haven't read all his notes.

319
00:31:05,691 --> 00:31:07,859
Shall we take a look at the horse,
and pick up Harris?

320
00:31:08,026 --> 00:31:10,611
We should let him know
at least what we know.

321
00:31:10,777 --> 00:31:12,361
- Good morning.
- Hello, Toni.

322
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:14,279
You look like you've been up
all night.

323
00:31:14,446 --> 00:31:15,446
We have.

324
00:31:15,613 --> 00:31:18,198
- How about some breakfast?
- We've just had supper.

325
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:20,616
- We have to go to Philips' place.
- Right, let's go.

326
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:23,034
- I'm afraid you can't come.
- Why not?

327
00:31:23,617 --> 00:31:26,118
- It might be dangerous.
- What might?

328
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,537
Look, last night we went up there
and found four more bodies.

329
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:33,706
We think they created something in
that lab that's causing these deaths.

330
00:31:33,872 --> 00:31:35,623
- What do you mean "something"?
- Just that...

331
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,207
We don't know, yet.

332
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:40,876
If you there's something running
loose, you can't leave me alone!

333
00:31:41,043 --> 00:31:43,794
- Toni, this could be...
- Please! Don't leave me alone.

334
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:47,963
Perhaps you're right.

335
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:05,305
Oh, no!

336
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:14,643
- What's happened?
- Something was on the rear window.

337
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,477
- What?
- I'm not quite sure.

338
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,645
- What did it look like?
- It was...

339
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:20,896
I don't know, it was greyish.

340
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:23,981
- Think, this is important.
- There was a strange sound.

341
00:32:24,148 --> 00:32:25,899
- What kind of a sound?
- I don't know...

342
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,400
Let's have a look.

343
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:40,073
Brian, hold it!
Come back to the car.

344
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:46,993
We better not get too close
until we know what we're up against.

345
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,077
What do you think it is?

346
00:32:48,244 --> 00:32:50,495
I don't know,
but let's not take any risks.

347
00:32:50,662 --> 00:32:51,829
Especially with me.

348
00:32:51,996 --> 00:32:54,414
We better get Harris and get back,
we might need help.

349
00:33:27,514 --> 00:33:30,265
- He must be here, that's his bicycle.
- Toni, stay in the car.

350
00:33:30,432 --> 00:33:32,016
No, not with those things
around.

351
00:33:32,183 --> 00:33:34,267
Let her come, I wouldn't
want to stay here alone.

352
00:33:34,517 --> 00:33:36,185
OK, but stick close together.

353
00:33:38,436 --> 00:33:39,353
Harris?

354
00:33:40,354 --> 00:33:41,688
Constable Harris?

355
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:43,105
Harris?

356
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,440
Let's see if he's in the basement.

357
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,444
Harris?

358
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:58,446
Look! It's Harris.

359
00:34:14,454 --> 00:34:15,788
Good Lord, what's that?

360
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,041
Let's get out of here.

361
00:34:48,138 --> 00:34:49,389
Don't get too close!

362
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:46,918
They've divided!

363
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,754
- Let's get through them.
- Wait!

364
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:54,255
Let me try first.

365
00:36:06,511 --> 00:36:07,512
Come on!

366
00:36:08,513 --> 00:36:09,680
No, no.

367
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:12,181
- We've got to. Now. Come on!
- No!

368
00:36:12,515 --> 00:36:14,849
Hurry! They may not remain
inactive long.

369
00:36:15,016 --> 00:36:17,350
Listen! They're inactive
because they divided

370
00:36:17,517 --> 00:36:19,685
but we don't know for how long,
So, come on!

371
00:36:19,852 --> 00:36:22,186
- David, I'm so frightened.
- So am I.

372
00:36:26,021 --> 00:36:27,522
- Are you all right?
- No!

373
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:30,023
- There's one out here.
- Into the car, quick!

374
00:36:38,778 --> 00:36:39,945
Damn!

375
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:54,369
- Hurry!
- I'm trying!

376
00:36:59,455 --> 00:37:00,789
I think that's got it.

377
00:37:23,718 --> 00:37:24,885
Here, take this.

378
00:37:25,135 --> 00:37:27,803
- Come on, drink it.
- Oh, David...

379
00:37:27,970 --> 00:37:29,137
Come on.

380
00:37:29,721 --> 00:37:32,389
I want you to get some sleep
and this will do the trick.

381
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:36,974
I'm so scared.
I've never seen anyone die before.

382
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:40,559
Now, don't think about it.
We'll find an answer, we've got to.

383
00:37:40,726 --> 00:37:44,561
- I never saw anything so horrible.
- Me neither.

384
00:37:45,312 --> 00:37:47,980
Now, you just relax
and try and get some sleep.

385
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:51,648
- What's going to happen to us?
- Nothing, we'll be all right.

386
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:54,066
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

387
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:58,986
- I'm sorry I ever brought you here.
- There's no reason to be sorry.

388
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:00,903
I wanted to come.

389
00:38:02,654 --> 00:38:04,155
- David?
- Yes.

390
00:38:04,905 --> 00:38:06,489
Are you really sorry I came?

391
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:13,660
- I won't let you down.
- I know you won't.

392
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,911
We'll get out of this somehow.

393
00:38:21,831 --> 00:38:22,831
Somehow.

394
00:38:55,264 --> 00:38:57,098
- How is she?
- I gave her a sedative.

395
00:38:57,265 --> 00:38:59,100
Good. I could do
with a sedative myself.

396
00:38:59,266 --> 00:39:00,517
What did you find out?

397
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:03,352
They're in chronological order.
The last one is a few days old.

398
00:39:03,518 --> 00:39:04,519
What's the entry?

399
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:07,520
It's about Phillips' dog-getting
an overdose of radiation.

400
00:39:07,687 --> 00:39:08,854
Anything else?

401
00:39:09,271 --> 00:39:12,606
They attempted to fuse the nucleus
but look at this protein structure:

402
00:39:12,773 --> 00:39:14,691
It isn't adenosine triphosphate.

403
00:39:35,868 --> 00:39:38,620
Where have you been?
I've come for my goods.

404
00:39:38,786 --> 00:39:41,038
Sorry, Jonesy,
the store's closed today.

405
00:39:41,288 --> 00:39:43,872
- Have you seen Dr. Landers?
- Not since 7 this morning.

406
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,123
He left in his car
with two men and a girl.

407
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,791
- Strangers.
- What strangers?

408
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:49,709
The ones that came in
on the plane, last night.

409
00:39:50,042 --> 00:39:51,293
What plane? Where are they?

410
00:39:51,876 --> 00:39:54,044
- Maybe they've over at the inn.
- Come on.

411
00:39:56,462 --> 00:39:57,713
What about my goods?

412
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,798
If you check that
with 404, you see?

413
00:40:04,633 --> 00:40:07,218
Hello. Are you the folk
that are with Dr. Landers?

414
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:08,718
We've been working with him.
Who are you?

415
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:12,637
I'm Campbell, head of the island.
This is Argyle who runs the store.

416
00:40:12,804 --> 00:40:14,388
I'm Dr. West
and this is Dr. Stanley.

417
00:40:14,555 --> 00:40:15,388
How do you do?

418
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:17,890
And where's the Doc?
Dr. Landers?

419
00:40:19,807 --> 00:40:21,058
I'm afraid Dr. Landers is dead.

420
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:26,311
Dr. Landers dead!
How did it happen?

421
00:40:27,228 --> 00:40:28,395
Please sit down.

422
00:40:34,815 --> 00:40:35,732
Well?

423
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,067
Now this is very difficult
to explain.

424
00:40:39,234 --> 00:40:41,485
There are creatures loose here
and they're dangerous.

425
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:43,569
What do you mean?
What are they?

426
00:40:44,236 --> 00:40:47,738
We're not sure, but we think they're
due to Dr. Philips' experiments.

427
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,489
What do you mean "creatures"?

428
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,657
I wish I could tell you more,
but we don't know what they are.

429
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:56,409
- Creatures?
- Doctor, this is a bit hard to take.

430
00:40:57,577 --> 00:40:59,578
I assure you we're not mad.

431
00:41:00,745 --> 00:41:04,580
Dr. Philips', created some kind
of living organism that kills.

432
00:41:06,581 --> 00:41:08,999
That's what happened to Dr. Landers?
Yes.

433
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,584
We'll need your help
if this island is to survive.

434
00:41:13,251 --> 00:41:15,919
- Survive?
- What do you want us to do?

435
00:41:16,586 --> 00:41:19,338
First of all, I'll need
ten good men beside yourselves.

436
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:22,506
- I can find those for you all right.
- Good.

437
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:25,007
I want all the villagers together
in an hour.

438
00:41:25,424 --> 00:41:26,925
That's short notice.

439
00:41:27,175 --> 00:41:29,176
We can gather
in the meeting hall.

440
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,761
Right. I'll let you know
everything more fully then.

441
00:41:33,178 --> 00:41:37,013
- We'd better tell the Constable.
- I'm sorry, you're late. He's dead.

442
00:41:37,347 --> 00:41:39,598
- The Constable too?
- Yes, and Ian Bellows.

443
00:41:41,682 --> 00:41:44,350
You know, we've had
reports of animals dying.

444
00:41:44,517 --> 00:41:46,602
- It seems as if they had no bones.
- Where?

445
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:49,103
Several places.
In the northern part of the island.

446
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:52,355
- Has anything occurred in the centre?
- No, just north of the centre.

447
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:54,189
- We haven't time, they're moving.
- How many?

448
00:41:54,356 --> 00:41:56,440
We'll explain at the hall,
we must finish these notes.

449
00:41:56,607 --> 00:41:58,441
- We'll do as you say.
- Thank you.

450
00:41:58,608 --> 00:42:01,276
- Now they tried experiment 1165...
- Yes.

451
00:42:01,526 --> 00:42:04,444
And if you compare that with 1143,
the results were negative.

452
00:42:13,282 --> 00:42:15,783
Quiet! Quiet, please!

453
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,952
Now, that's all we know
at the moment.

454
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:33,626
Your attention, please.
I'm Dr. West and this is Dr. Stanley.

455
00:42:33,792 --> 00:42:35,877
We've completed going over
Dr. Philips' notes

456
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:39,545
and I must warn you that we're in
a dangerous situation. Dr. Stanley?

457
00:42:40,963 --> 00:42:43,297
Let me explain what
we've discovered so far.

458
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:46,465
In order to understand
the nature of cancer,

459
00:42:46,632 --> 00:42:48,800
Dr. Philips was trying
to create living cells.

460
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:51,468
Cells that he hoped
would attack the cancer.

461
00:42:51,885 --> 00:42:55,553
He based this on the carbon atom
which is the basis of all life.

462
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:56,804
He didn't succeed.

463
00:42:57,471 --> 00:43:01,140
But he probably created a form
of life based on the silicon atom.

464
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:04,225
Now these Silicates,
as we call them, eat animal bone,

465
00:43:05,142 --> 00:43:06,142
human bone.

466
00:43:06,309 --> 00:43:08,977
Dr. Philips' gave life
to some kind of organism,

467
00:43:09,394 --> 00:43:11,061
something we know nothing about.

468
00:43:11,478 --> 00:43:14,730
Their external skeletal structure
is tough and resilient.

469
00:43:14,897 --> 00:43:17,565
We couldn't hurt it with an axe and
when run over, it was unharmed.

470
00:43:18,982 --> 00:43:21,317
We haven't found
a way to destroy them yet,

471
00:43:21,483 --> 00:43:23,234
but shall attack them
with everything we can.

472
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,486
From Dr. Philips' notes
and our own experience,

473
00:43:26,653 --> 00:43:29,321
we calculate that these creatures
divide every six hours.

474
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:32,906
There are about 64 silicates
on the island at this moment.

475
00:43:33,156 --> 00:43:35,240
There'll be 128
by six o'clock this evening.

476
00:43:36,824 --> 00:43:39,242
- 256 by midnight.
- What?

477
00:43:39,493 --> 00:43:42,911
And if this continues, at the end
of the week, there'll be a million.

478
00:43:44,162 --> 00:43:46,579
Please, I must have your attention!

479
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,582
The only way to stop them if all
else fails, is to deny them food.

480
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:52,916
We want you to move
into this building with supplies,

481
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:54,917
round up the cattle
and bring it here.

482
00:43:56,918 --> 00:43:58,169
We must keep calm.

483
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,337
Fear and panic will defeat us
just as surely as the Silicates.

484
00:44:01,671 --> 00:44:04,839
We need your help and co-operation.
We must work together.

485
00:44:05,756 --> 00:44:06,673
Thank you.

486
00:44:08,257 --> 00:44:12,343
Right. The following men meet me
in the room out the back there.

487
00:44:12,676 --> 00:44:14,427
Er... Morton...

488
00:44:14,594 --> 00:44:15,844
Er... Dunley...

489
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:18,096
- Are there any guns on the island?
- Plenty.

490
00:44:18,262 --> 00:44:20,513
- And dynamite?
- I've got three cases.

491
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:23,265
We ought to make petrol bombs,
we don't know what'll work.

492
00:44:23,598 --> 00:44:27,100
We'll send out three scouts:
Here, here and there.

493
00:44:27,767 --> 00:44:29,351
Dunley, you and two others.

494
00:44:29,685 --> 00:44:33,103
The rest of you gather up
the equipment and meet here.

495
00:44:33,687 --> 00:44:35,521
You all know
the groups assigned to you.

496
00:44:36,105 --> 00:44:38,022
Williams and Martindale,
round up the cattle

497
00:44:38,439 --> 00:44:39,773
and bring them along
to William's field there,

498
00:44:40,107 --> 00:44:41,124
by the village.

499
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:43,192
Right, let's get moving.

500
00:44:45,276 --> 00:44:47,777
Can I rely on you to see
that everything's fine at the hall?

501
00:44:47,944 --> 00:44:49,695
- Yes, of course, I think I can cope.
- Fine.

502
00:44:49,862 --> 00:44:51,696
Now make sure all the supplies
are organised properly

503
00:44:51,863 --> 00:44:53,280
and try and keep them
from panicking.

504
00:44:53,447 --> 00:44:55,114
- I will. David...
- Hm?

505
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:57,699
- Take care.
- I'll do my best.

506
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,201
Don't worry, we'll be back,
whether we destroy them or not.

507
00:45:11,456 --> 00:45:14,708
- How many can you count?
- About 25, as far as I can see.

508
00:45:20,127 --> 00:45:21,461
- Got everything?
- I think so.

509
00:45:21,628 --> 00:45:22,879
- Where's the Geiger counter?
- Why?

510
00:45:23,045 --> 00:45:25,713
If they're radioactive,
we'll have to protect ourselves.

511
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:26,814
Give us a hand.

512
00:45:29,465 --> 00:45:31,466
Halsey,
your group take the dynamite.

513
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:33,717
Morton, you bring the petrol bombs.

514
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:14,822
It's no good,
we hit it several times.

515
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:30,246
They don't seem
to be moving very fast.

516
00:46:30,997 --> 00:46:32,914
I'll cross that one's trail
and get a Geiger reading.

517
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,416
- Careful. Don't get too near.
- Don't worry.

518
00:47:05,014 --> 00:47:06,515
Careful! Behind you!

519
00:47:14,185 --> 00:47:16,770
- Nasty little creatures.
- We better try the petrol bombs.

520
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,688
There wasn't any sign
of radioactivity.

521
00:47:18,854 --> 00:47:20,272
That's something, anyway.

522
00:47:22,023 --> 00:47:23,440
The rest of you stay here.

523
00:47:48,036 --> 00:47:50,787
- I'll get up closer.
- All right, but watch it.

524
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:19,219
Try another!

525
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:33,726
Hey, stop, come back here!

526
00:48:34,393 --> 00:48:35,810
Let's try the dynamite.

527
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:52,986
Right, everybody spread out.

528
00:49:00,906 --> 00:49:02,074
All right, light them up.

529
00:49:42,094 --> 00:49:43,678
Nothing gets through to them.

530
00:49:43,845 --> 00:49:45,929
At this rate, they'll reach the village
by midnight.

531
00:49:46,096 --> 00:49:47,764
What else could we do?

532
00:49:48,681 --> 00:49:50,598
- Starve them.
- Mr. Campbell!

533
00:49:51,849 --> 00:49:54,601
- What is it, Dunley?
- In Parson's Cove...

534
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:58,186
It's one of the Silicates. It's dead.

535
00:49:58,853 --> 00:50:01,020
- Are you sure?
- It hasn't moved in 20 minutes.

536
00:50:01,854 --> 00:50:02,855
And another thing,

537
00:50:03,021 --> 00:50:06,940
that Great Dane of Philips'
is nearby. Half eaten.

538
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:08,691
Philips' dog!

539
00:50:08,858 --> 00:50:11,192
Remember, the dog
had an overdose of radiation.

540
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:12,860
Let's have the Geiger counter.

541
00:50:24,949 --> 00:50:26,950
Here it is,
and the dog's over there.

542
00:51:01,385 --> 00:51:03,135
It's loaded with radioactivity.

543
00:51:09,722 --> 00:51:11,056
Radioactive too.

544
00:51:12,390 --> 00:51:15,058
Let's put them on the truck
and take them to the clinic.

545
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:24,897
Take it round the back!

546
00:51:28,565 --> 00:51:31,150
David, I'm so glad you're here,
they're starting to panic.

547
00:51:31,483 --> 00:51:32,651
All right, take it easy.

548
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:35,986
Please listen to me.

549
00:51:36,736 --> 00:51:38,820
Will you listen to me, PLEASE!

550
00:51:39,737 --> 00:51:41,822
I've something
of great importance to tell you.

551
00:51:42,322 --> 00:51:44,407
I think we've found a way
to destroy the Silicates.

552
00:51:44,573 --> 00:51:46,658
But we'll need the help
of everyone here.

553
00:51:46,824 --> 00:51:49,409
We'll examine a dead one and I think
it'll give us what we need.

554
00:51:49,576 --> 00:51:52,911
Meanwhile, stay here
and do as Miss Merrill says.

555
00:51:53,745 --> 00:51:54,662
Can you stop them?

556
00:51:54,828 --> 00:51:57,413
Keep the people here,
and keep them busy at all costs.

557
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,664
- What have you found out?
- I've no time to explain.

558
00:51:59,831 --> 00:52:01,749
We'll be in the clinic
if you need us.

559
00:52:05,501 --> 00:52:08,335
The outer shell is impenetrable.
We've done everything to pierce it.

560
00:52:08,502 --> 00:52:10,336
- But radiation will kill them.
- How?

561
00:52:10,503 --> 00:52:13,588
The dog was contaminated with
strontium, that effects the bone.

562
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,173
It ate the bone plus the strontium,
that's why it died.

563
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:18,257
How can we introduce the radiation
into their systems?

564
00:52:18,757 --> 00:52:19,591
Can it be done?

565
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:21,342
Philips' had a supply of isotopes.

566
00:52:21,676 --> 00:52:24,927
If we can get enough Strontium 90,
we can contaminate the cattle.

567
00:52:25,094 --> 00:52:27,345
The Silicates eat the cattle...
It's a hope.

568
00:52:27,512 --> 00:52:31,014
Can you move the cattle closer,
to keep them safe until we're ready?

569
00:52:31,347 --> 00:52:32,848
We can put them
in my cattle yard.

570
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:36,016
Then do so. Dr. Stanley and I
are going up to Philips' place.

571
00:52:36,183 --> 00:52:38,934
Now if we don't come back,
you'll have to get the Strontium 90.

572
00:52:39,101 --> 00:52:41,352
- But we don't know...
- We'll tell you what to do.

573
00:52:55,943 --> 00:52:57,444
Dave, stop the car.

574
00:53:01,029 --> 00:53:02,947
- What is it?
- Look over there. Silicates.

575
00:53:06,115 --> 00:53:07,532
There are more of them.

576
00:53:34,129 --> 00:53:36,547
I'm not keen on going down
in that cellar again.

577
00:53:45,302 --> 00:53:46,552
It looks safe.

578
00:53:57,058 --> 00:54:01,143
There must be some instrument that
they used to contaminate the animals.

579
00:54:01,310 --> 00:54:02,644
I'll have a look around.

580
00:54:06,812 --> 00:54:09,064
- What about this?
- That's it.

581
00:54:09,314 --> 00:54:10,648
Better put these on.

582
00:56:33,387 --> 00:56:35,305
- I forgot the gloves.
- I'll put this in the car.

583
00:57:11,073 --> 00:57:12,324
David!

584
00:57:13,741 --> 00:57:14,825
David!

585
00:57:28,832 --> 00:57:31,167
- Brian, I...
- You must, you must!

586
00:57:48,926 --> 00:57:50,093
Can you hold that?

587
00:57:51,344 --> 00:57:53,011
Keys, in the boot.

588
00:58:02,850 --> 00:58:04,684
Try and hang on
until we get back.

589
00:58:20,025 --> 00:58:22,026
- Thank you, nurse.
- How are you feeling?

590
00:58:22,276 --> 00:58:24,277
- As well as can be expected.
- He's had a lot of pain.

591
00:58:24,527 --> 00:58:26,612
- Not much.
- I'll give you another morphine.

592
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:29,863
First a sloppy bit of surgery and now
you're turning me into a drug addict.

593
00:58:30,030 --> 00:58:31,698
- It's your choice.
- I don't need it.

594
00:58:31,864 --> 00:58:34,366
All right, but we'll give you
another transfusion.

595
00:58:34,782 --> 00:58:37,367
One more, and I'll be
a full-blooded Irishman.

596
00:58:37,534 --> 00:58:38,785
I think he's feeling better.

597
00:59:12,385 --> 00:59:13,969
- Is that all the cattle?
- That's all.

598
00:59:14,136 --> 00:59:16,554
Most of them.
Very few escaped the round-up.

599
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,888
Let's hope
we've got enough Strontium 90.

600
00:59:25,142 --> 00:59:26,642
Herd them through one at a time.

601
01:00:04,995 --> 01:00:05,996
That's the lot.

602
01:00:07,330 --> 01:00:09,081
I had to cut down the shots
on the last few.

603
01:00:09,247 --> 01:00:11,332
- Do you think it'll be enough?
- I don't know.

604
01:00:11,582 --> 01:00:13,833
Let's get back,
and get those lights strung up.

605
01:00:14,917 --> 01:00:16,084
You've done it.

606
01:00:16,584 --> 01:00:18,335
- Give us a bulb.
- Here, take this.

607
01:00:19,669 --> 01:00:21,504
Yeah, that's it.

608
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:23,671
What if it doesn't work?

609
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:26,506
Then we'll just have to
wait for help.

610
01:00:26,673 --> 01:00:29,508
Our biggest worry is that they'll
panic. They must understand.

611
01:00:29,841 --> 01:00:32,092
They're scared to death...
So am I.

612
01:00:32,259 --> 01:00:34,510
We're all scared. If they go
outside, it's certain death.

613
01:00:34,677 --> 01:00:36,428
Those things will be
all over the building.

614
01:00:36,595 --> 01:00:38,262
Probably.
Now, look,

615
01:00:38,429 --> 01:00:40,513
you must keep the people
calm, they trust you.

616
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,847
I'll do my best.

617
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:48,767
The lights are a strain
on the generator.

618
01:00:48,934 --> 01:00:51,936
- That'd really cause a panic.
- I've got torches and candles.

619
01:00:52,103 --> 01:00:54,854
- I hope we don't need them.
- We've food for a week.

620
01:00:55,021 --> 01:00:56,605
You must convince the villagers.

621
01:00:56,772 --> 01:00:59,856
Our one hope is that they'll starve
if the Strontium doesn't work,

622
01:01:00,023 --> 01:01:02,358
or at least the lack of food
may cut down the multiplication.

623
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,443
- Are you going to have a look?
- Yes, but first I'll see Stanley.

624
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:07,194
I'll talk to the people.

625
01:01:07,527 --> 01:01:09,862
You move around amongst them
and keep them occupied.

626
01:01:10,028 --> 01:01:11,946
Get help from Dunley
and some of the others.

627
01:01:12,113 --> 01:01:13,113
Good.

628
01:01:13,363 --> 01:01:16,865
I've injected the cattle but
we ran short of the Strontium 90.

629
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:18,699
I had to cut down
on the last few.

630
01:01:18,866 --> 01:01:22,535
If it doesn't work, we'll wait until
the helicopter or boat arrives.

631
01:01:22,868 --> 01:01:26,370
- When will the Silicates get here?
- It's a little after ten.

632
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,121
According to the last positions,
in about an hour and a half.

633
01:01:29,288 --> 01:01:30,706
What about the division time?

634
01:01:31,373 --> 01:01:34,708
That may take some time
and there aren't that many cattle.

635
01:01:35,041 --> 01:01:36,208
You get some rest.

636
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:37,959
A perfect time for a nap.

637
01:01:38,126 --> 01:01:40,877
You will let me know if anything
unusual happens, won't you?

638
01:01:42,462 --> 01:01:43,712
We've got to get out of here.

639
01:01:43,879 --> 01:01:46,964
Where can we go?
We can't reach the mainland.

640
01:01:47,297 --> 01:01:49,715
If you'd seen what it did to Archie,
you'd swim.

641
01:01:49,882 --> 01:01:50,883
Halsey!

642
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:53,134
Shut up.

643
01:01:53,551 --> 01:01:54,885
Listen all of you,

644
01:01:55,301 --> 01:01:57,636
if anyone leaves this building,
they'll be killed for sure.

645
01:01:57,803 --> 01:02:01,054
We're safe enough in here, we've got
enough food and water to wait.

646
01:02:01,304 --> 01:02:02,889
I'm so frightened, Mr. Campbell.

647
01:02:03,055 --> 01:02:05,307
If you do as we say,
you've nothing to fear.

648
01:02:05,473 --> 01:02:07,057
- Will you trust me?
- Yes.

649
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,393
Now, listen, Halsey,
and listen well.

650
01:02:11,726 --> 01:02:15,729
If I hear another sound out of you,
I'll throw you out for those things.

651
01:02:15,895 --> 01:02:17,563
I'm talking straight,
understand?

652
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:20,314
- Mr. Campbell, I can't stand it...
- Do you understand?

653
01:02:20,731 --> 01:02:21,982
Mind that you do.

654
01:02:23,316 --> 01:02:26,818
There's nothing to fear. We'll be
all right as long as we stay here.

655
01:02:26,984 --> 01:02:28,568
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

656
01:02:28,735 --> 01:02:30,986
Why, I've stuffed this place
with supplies on credit.

657
01:02:32,904 --> 01:02:34,738
He's a much better colour,
he'll rest now.

658
01:02:34,988 --> 01:02:36,072
Now what?

659
01:02:36,322 --> 01:02:39,824
- I think you could use some rest too.
- I suppose we all could.

660
01:02:39,991 --> 01:02:42,992
- Why don't you go and lie down?
- I'd rather not, not now.

661
01:02:43,326 --> 01:02:44,660
- David?
- Hm?

662
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:46,828
Do you really think
we'll get out of this?

663
01:02:47,745 --> 01:02:51,163
Well, I think we stand
a very good chance, yes.

664
01:02:51,497 --> 01:02:53,414
But you don't believe that, do you?

665
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:58,083
Not 100%, no,
but I'd like to believe it.

666
01:02:58,250 --> 01:02:59,251
Toni?

667
01:03:01,252 --> 01:03:04,003
I've never been...
I've never been much good at...

668
01:03:04,587 --> 01:03:07,005
At being serious with a woman
before now, but...

669
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:08,922
If we get out of this, I will...

670
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,758
Don't say anything more.
Not here, not now.

671
01:03:15,676 --> 01:03:17,593
Yes, I'd better get outside,
it's nearly midnight.

672
01:03:17,844 --> 01:03:20,095
David, be careful,

673
01:03:21,012 --> 01:03:22,262
I love you.

674
01:03:39,521 --> 01:03:41,189
The cattle are getting restless.

675
01:03:43,023 --> 01:03:45,191
Aye, they're moving around a lot.

676
01:03:47,775 --> 01:03:51,111
- How are the people taking things?
- I think it'll be all right.

677
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:53,945
- The boys are keeping the talk going.
- Good.

678
01:04:01,032 --> 01:04:02,366
How many, do you think?

679
01:04:03,117 --> 01:04:04,617
Hard to tell. About 100.

680
01:04:05,284 --> 01:04:07,952
- So they didn't divide.
- It doesn't look like it.

681
01:04:12,621 --> 01:04:13,789
Well, this is it.

682
01:04:14,539 --> 01:04:15,873
It's a nightmare.

683
01:04:20,626 --> 01:04:21,626
It's all over.

684
01:04:24,127 --> 01:04:25,545
They're coming this way!

685
01:04:29,297 --> 01:04:30,881
- Not stopping.
- No.

686
01:04:31,048 --> 01:04:33,132
- Good Lord, look!
- They're dividing.

687
01:04:34,716 --> 01:04:36,717
That means the effect
of the Strontium will be halved.

688
01:04:36,884 --> 01:04:39,385
- I'd hoped it'd work before then.
- Let's get inside.

689
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:51,058
Tell them it may take time
to work.

690
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:53,309
- Will it work?
- I wish I knew.

691
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:03,481
- Brian, they've divided.
- What does that mean?

692
01:05:03,731 --> 01:05:06,566
That the power and effect of
the Strontium is cut in half.

693
01:05:06,732 --> 01:05:09,067
Did they divide before
or after they ate the cattle?

694
01:05:09,234 --> 01:05:10,901
- After.
- That's something.

695
01:05:11,068 --> 01:05:14,236
- Not much, but it's something.
- How's your arm?

696
01:05:14,403 --> 01:05:16,071
I'm trying not to think about it.

697
01:05:16,321 --> 01:05:18,488
It may take time
for the Strontium to work.

698
01:05:18,655 --> 01:05:19,739
If it works.

699
01:05:29,911 --> 01:05:31,995
- I don't like this.
- The generator's had it.

700
01:05:32,245 --> 01:05:33,830
- They're coming.
- I can hear.

701
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:35,414
I'd better talk to them.

702
01:05:36,998 --> 01:05:38,165
- Quiet everyone!
- Hold it!

703
01:05:38,332 --> 01:05:40,583
- Please try and be quiet!
- Now don't panic.

704
01:05:40,750 --> 01:05:43,501
We expected them here.
We must give it time to work.

705
01:05:47,503 --> 01:05:49,171
Light the candles and lanterns.

706
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,506
Take it easy! Take it easy!

707
01:05:53,673 --> 01:05:55,341
Quiet, please. Quiet.

708
01:05:55,924 --> 01:05:57,842
They're frightened without the light.

709
01:05:58,009 --> 01:05:59,426
- If they start breaking out.
- I know.

710
01:05:59,593 --> 01:06:01,344
Come on, we've got a job to do.

711
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:06,179
- What's happened to the lights?
- Quiet!

712
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:08,431
Be careful,
they're panicking as it is.

713
01:06:08,597 --> 01:06:10,848
- I'm sorry.
- We've got to set an example.

714
01:06:20,687 --> 01:06:21,854
I'm not staying here.

715
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,940
I'll shoot anyone that moves,
I mean it.

716
01:06:28,441 --> 01:06:29,691
I'll shoot anyone that moves.

717
01:06:30,192 --> 01:06:33,110
Get back to your places,
away from the windows and the door.

718
01:06:40,780 --> 01:06:42,031
Look out!

719
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:03,875
Get to the clinic,
as many as you can!

720
01:07:07,461 --> 01:07:09,045
Open the door!

721
01:07:10,379 --> 01:07:12,713
They're breaking in.
Take care of her, I'll be back.

722
01:07:12,963 --> 01:07:13,714
Wait!

723
01:07:16,465 --> 01:07:18,383
Come on,
quickly, block it!

724
01:07:18,550 --> 01:07:20,134
Quick, bring anything you can!

725
01:07:20,301 --> 01:07:22,051
Quickly, bring it over here!

726
01:07:22,802 --> 01:07:25,887
- Hold on.
- I'm trying, but I'm so frightened.

727
01:07:26,971 --> 01:07:27,888
I'm frightened.

728
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:43,646
No place else to go.

729
01:08:28,835 --> 01:08:30,420
Hold it,
they're getting weaker.

730
01:09:00,268 --> 01:09:01,352
Careful.

731
01:09:09,023 --> 01:09:10,607
Give me a hand with this.

732
01:09:49,543 --> 01:09:50,460
They're dead.

733
01:09:51,628 --> 01:09:54,212
- Oh, David!
- Darling, it's all over.

734
01:09:54,379 --> 01:09:55,797
We're all right now.

735
01:09:56,797 --> 01:09:59,799
- And now my hand itches.
- Oh, shut up, Brian.

736
01:10:00,132 --> 01:10:02,467
Watch it, or I'll sue you
for malpractice.

737
01:10:08,636 --> 01:10:10,888
As soon as we get on,
we'll radio ahead for aid.

738
01:10:11,054 --> 01:10:13,305
We'll need a lot of help to clean up
the island, bury the dead.

739
01:10:13,556 --> 01:10:15,390
They'll send everything,
this afternoon.

740
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:17,724
I wish Philips'
had never started this.

741
01:10:17,891 --> 01:10:19,976
No, he was just trying
to help humanity.

742
01:10:20,142 --> 01:10:23,811
Science has its risks, but they
aren't enough to hinder progress.

743
01:10:24,228 --> 01:10:27,229
- Have you searched the island?
- Yes, several times.

744
01:10:27,396 --> 01:10:28,730
We killed them all, I'm certain.

745
01:10:55,243 --> 01:10:56,911
I shudder to think of them.

746
01:10:57,078 --> 01:10:59,496
Don't think about them, just try
to get them out of your mind.

747
01:10:59,662 --> 01:11:01,580
- It's easier said than done.
- I know.

748
01:11:01,997 --> 01:11:04,998
- What'll happen to the villagers?
- We'll send back help.

749
01:11:05,665 --> 01:11:07,500
You know, we were lucky
this is an island.

750
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,335
If it had happened anywhere else,
I doubt we would've destroyed them.
