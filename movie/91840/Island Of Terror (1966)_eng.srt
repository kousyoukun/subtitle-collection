1
00:00:22,955 --> 00:00:24,707
Steady as you go.

2
00:00:30,555 --> 00:00:32,227
Steady now, steady.

3
00:00:33,515 --> 00:00:35,471
All right,
let's have it on the truck.

4
00:00:42,715 --> 00:00:44,671
Is that all they need?

5
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,788
Yes, I think so. How long
will it take to fill the order?

6
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,146
- Probably 3 to 4 weeks.
- We need a better service.

7
00:00:52,355 --> 00:00:54,425
A boat once a week
isn't enough.

8
00:00:55,075 --> 00:00:57,191
At least they could
install telephones.

9
00:00:57,395 --> 00:01:00,592
- Yes. They promised them this year.
- Yes, and last.

10
00:01:01,755 --> 00:01:04,349
- Morning, Campbell, Peter, Ian.
- Morning, Dr. Landers.

11
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:06,386
I'd like to mail these people.

12
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:07,750
More books?

13
00:01:07,995 --> 00:01:10,953
You islanders are too hardy.
I have to keep busy.

14
00:01:11,235 --> 00:01:13,749
You know, you and I
should take up chess.

15
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,946
I've nothing to do either,
except when Andy McCracken

16
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,908
has a drop too much
and tries to brig up the pub.

17
00:01:19,315 --> 00:01:22,148
Why not try talking
to Dr Phillips over there?

18
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:41,110
He doesn't like company. That's why
he picked this isolated place.

19
00:01:41,315 --> 00:01:42,748
No contact with the mainland.

20
00:01:42,955 --> 00:01:45,264
- He's an odd one.
- Not really,

21
00:01:45,475 --> 00:01:47,784
he's one of the top
research men in the worid.

22
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:51,590
- Researchers are like that.
- We wouldn't mind a bit of contact.

23
00:01:52,355 --> 00:01:55,028
They don't care about us,
we don't pay enough taxes.

24
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:58,625
- Right, Constable?
- Speak for yourself, Ian.

25
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:03,664
- It smells like fog.
- I think it'll be a lovely evening.

26
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:05,945
If you weren't a newcomer,
you'd feel it.

27
00:02:06,155 --> 00:02:08,271
A newcomer!
I've been here for ten years.

28
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:10,591
A newcomer just the same.

29
00:02:42,235 --> 00:02:43,509
Good.

30
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:46,948
The cell cultures are prepared,
we can begin.

31
00:02:47,155 --> 00:02:50,830
Are we going ahead without hearing
from Rome, New York, Tokio?

32
00:02:51,035 --> 00:02:55,074
I've mailed them full reports.
They'll start when they get them.

33
00:02:55,275 --> 00:02:57,835
The potential across the cell
membrane must be maintained

34
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:00,071
during the radiation of the nucleus.

35
00:03:00,315 --> 00:03:02,431
- Is the tritium state complete?
- Yes.

36
00:03:02,635 --> 00:03:05,229
- And the vapour applicator?
- It's been corrected.

37
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,825
- The connect problem has been solved.
- Good.

38
00:03:09,635 --> 00:03:11,591
Now we've received
the infusion equipment,

39
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:14,832
I'm certain they'll understand
my reasons for going ahead.

40
00:03:15,315 --> 00:03:17,431
I've waited
a long time for this moment.

41
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:22,153
If we're successful today, it may
well be we have the cure for cancer.

42
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:22,152
- Mrs. Bellows, come in.
- Thank you.

43
00:06:22,355 --> 00:06:24,152
Go over there by the fire.

44
00:06:24,835 --> 00:06:27,907
- What brings you here?
- I'm so sorry to bother you,

45
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:30,788
but I'm worried about Ian.
He hasn't come home.

46
00:06:30,995 --> 00:06:33,748
- Sit down. I'll get you some tea.
- No, thank you.

47
00:06:33,955 --> 00:06:36,515
Now settle down,
and tell me all about it.

48
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:41,274
Lan hasn't come home, he's three
hours late and that isn't like him.

49
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:42,988
I'm afraid something's happened.

50
00:06:43,635 --> 00:06:46,149
I'm sure it's nothing.
Did you try the pub?

51
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:49,427
They haven't seen him.
I've been all round the village.

52
00:06:49,635 --> 00:06:51,990
I'll tell you what,
I'll look for him,

53
00:06:52,195 --> 00:06:53,992
you go home
and I'll bring him.

54
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:58,384
- Do you think he's had an accident?
- No, I'm sure everything's all right.

55
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:01,063
I'll take a look at your north
field near Philips' house.

56
00:07:01,435 --> 00:07:03,266
Go on home
and don't worry.

57
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:06,865
I'll do as you say.
Sorry for being a nuisance.

58
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:10,670
- That's what I'm here for.
- Thank you very much indeed.

59
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:38,908
Lan!

60
00:07:43,795 --> 00:07:45,114
Lan Bellows!

61
00:08:05,955 --> 00:08:07,149
Lan!

62
00:09:19,995 --> 00:09:23,431
Doctor Landers!

63
00:09:27,235 --> 00:09:28,907
- Thank God.
- You're in a state.

64
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:31,424
- I am.
- Come in.

65
00:09:35,435 --> 00:09:36,788
Sit over there.

66
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:39,790
Now, tell me, what's happened?

67
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:45,552
Now, listen. I'm not a man
that's easily shaken, Doctor.

68
00:09:45,755 --> 00:09:47,825
- I know. Would you like a drink?
- No, no.

69
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:52,911
I've just seen something
and by all that's holy,

70
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:56,471
I just can't be sure,
but I think it's Ian Bellows.

71
00:09:57,275 --> 00:09:59,391
You think it's Ian?
What's happened?

72
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:04,067
I don't know,
his body is all like jelly.

73
00:10:05,315 --> 00:10:08,944
- Jelly!
- Aye. Like nothing I've ever seen.

74
00:10:10,195 --> 00:10:15,713
There was no face just a horrible
mush with the eyes sitting in it.

75
00:10:16,635 --> 00:10:18,068
Where did this happen?

76
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:22,794
Up near the peninsula,
on the path to Parson's Cove.

77
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:26,904
- Did anyone else see it?
- No, no, I don't think so.

78
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:32,384
Come on, I'll get my hat and coat.
We'll go over there.

79
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,115
It's a body,
but I can't recognise it.

80
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:44,313
- Those are Ian Bellow's clothes.
- Yes.

81
00:10:44,755 --> 00:10:47,952
- What's happened to him?
- I don't know.

82
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:51,824
As far as I can tell, the body
doesn't seem to have any bones.

83
00:10:52,435 --> 00:10:53,788
No bones?

84
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:58,983
Look.

85
00:11:02,275 --> 00:11:03,674
You see.

86
00:11:04,075 --> 00:11:07,590
I have to make a closer examination.
Let's get it back to the village.

87
00:11:07,795 --> 00:11:10,946
- I'll get something to carry it on.
- I'll wait here.

88
00:11:14,075 --> 00:11:15,554
Hurry up, will you?

89
00:11:22,795 --> 00:11:27,152
It's definitely Ian. I recognised
the appendectomy scar and birth mark.

90
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,153
My God.
What will I tell Mrs. Bellows?

91
00:11:30,355 --> 00:11:33,586
I'll come with you and give her
a sedative. She'll need it.

92
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:38,393
Don't mention the condition
of the body.

93
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:40,108
Of course not. I understand.

94
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:43,113
In fact, I don't want
this mentioned to anyone.

95
00:11:43,475 --> 00:11:45,511
They'll have to know soon enough.

96
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:48,183
Not until I find out
what we're dealing with.

97
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,273
What are you going to do?

98
00:11:51,075 --> 00:11:53,953
First, I'll go and see Phillips,
I need expert help.

99
00:11:54,155 --> 00:11:58,114
- This is quite beyond my knowledge.
- What if he won't help, or can't?

100
00:11:58,315 --> 00:12:01,591
I'll take the emergency launch and
visit Brian Stanley in London.

101
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:05,390
That's our only contact with
the mainland in case we need help.

102
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:07,631
Don't worry,
I'll come back immediately.

103
00:12:07,835 --> 00:12:09,348
Who is this Brian Stanley?

104
00:12:09,555 --> 00:12:12,228
He's the most eminent
pathologist in Britain.

105
00:12:12,795 --> 00:12:17,232
Whatever this disease is, it's
virulent and could be contagious.

106
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:22,311
We might fly back, so build
a signal fire on Moor Heights.

107
00:12:29,715 --> 00:12:32,024
That'll be all for today, gentlemen.

108
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,629
I...

109
00:12:33,835 --> 00:12:36,907
I do hope some of what
I've been saying has penetrated.

110
00:12:37,395 --> 00:12:41,513
From your last papers, I doubt if
you'll progress beyond first aid.

111
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:42,989
Good day.

112
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,827
- Oh, Dr. Stanley.
- Yes?

113
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:57,471
- This is Dr. Landers.
- Yes, I heard your telephone message.

114
00:12:57,675 --> 00:13:01,145
- How do you do? Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

115
00:13:01,955 --> 00:13:04,549
I practice on Peter's Island.
- Where's that?

116
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:07,986
- Off the East coast of Ireland.
- And what can I do for you?

117
00:13:08,675 --> 00:13:12,429
Do you know of any disease
that could dissolve human bone?

118
00:13:13,675 --> 00:13:15,472
No, I don't. Why?

119
00:13:16,155 --> 00:13:18,749
We've discovered a body
without any trace of bone in it.

120
00:13:20,155 --> 00:13:23,989
- No bone? Are you certain?
- Quite certain.

121
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:26,469
That's unbelievable!

122
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:31,552
- Have you heard this before?
- Nothing even remotely like it.

123
00:13:32,435 --> 00:13:34,471
I was hoping you could help me.

124
00:13:35,195 --> 00:13:38,312
- There was no trace of bone?
- None.

125
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:40,667
If that's true, it's beyond me.

126
00:13:41,115 --> 00:13:43,424
It's true.
I performed a complete autopsy.

127
00:13:50,555 --> 00:13:52,671
- Have you heard of David West?
- I think so.

128
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:55,753
He's the most qualified man
on bone disease I know.

129
00:13:55,955 --> 00:14:00,153
Let's try the Medical Library first,
then we'll go and see David.

130
00:14:00,355 --> 00:14:02,823
- If you think he'll help.
- If anyone can, he can.

131
00:14:24,315 --> 00:14:26,192
I couldn't find your bathrobe.

132
00:14:26,555 --> 00:14:29,274
I'm sure you don't find the female
anatomy shocking.

133
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:31,466
It's different from Harley St.
How's your dress?

134
00:14:31,675 --> 00:14:35,463
The spot's out,
but it'll take some time to dry.

135
00:14:35,675 --> 00:14:39,065
- Cured beautifully, don't you think?
- The credit isn't all mine.

136
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,867
- Excellent cognac, David.
- From an expert, that's a compliment.

137
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:46,511
You shouldn't believe everything
you read, they exaggerate.

138
00:14:46,795 --> 00:14:49,104
Everything about you
is exaggerated.

139
00:14:49,315 --> 00:14:52,273
You're too charming. To think
I had to break a leg to meet you.

140
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,909
And write off a very expensive
Maserati.

141
00:14:55,115 --> 00:14:58,505
Not every girl goes to such lengths
to meet a man.

142
00:14:58,715 --> 00:15:01,229
Besides, I'm sure it's going
to be worth it, isn't it?

143
00:15:01,435 --> 00:15:03,824
I may not get to places
as fast as a Maserati.

144
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:06,947
- But you do get there eventually.
- Eventually.

145
00:15:07,155 --> 00:15:08,668
- When?
- I'll let you know.

146
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:13,153
Don't take too long. You might
run out of petrol on the last lap.

147
00:15:19,755 --> 00:15:22,792
- A pitstop or the checkered flag?
- I don't know.

148
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:26,392
But in the meantime, my dressing gown
is in the bathroom.

149
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,947
Brian, what do you want
at this time?

150
00:15:36,155 --> 00:15:38,874
Good evening, David. I hope
we're interrupting something.

151
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,953
- May I present Dr. Reginald Landers.
- How do you do?

152
00:15:42,155 --> 00:15:44,430
He's brought you
an interesting problem.

153
00:15:44,635 --> 00:15:48,264
Yes. I've already got
an interesting problem for tonight.

154
00:15:49,075 --> 00:15:51,589
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

155
00:15:53,755 --> 00:15:55,108
We are interrupting.

156
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,591
Miss Toni Merrill, may I introduce
Dr. Stanley and Dr. Landers.

157
00:15:58,795 --> 00:16:00,274
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

158
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:02,033
Excuse my dress.

159
00:16:02,235 --> 00:16:06,706
David is better with a scalpel
that he is opening a bottle of wine.

160
00:16:07,755 --> 00:16:10,986
Reginald practices on some
little island off the Irish coast.

161
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:13,914
He's found a body
without any trace of bone.

162
00:16:15,715 --> 00:16:18,183
No bones? Yes, of course,
this is quite a common...

163
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,829
- I'm serious, doctor.
- I'm sorry, doctor.

164
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:24,789
I wasn't implying any lack of ability,
but it's difficult to accept.

165
00:16:24,995 --> 00:16:27,589
- I can show you the body.
- He did a complete autopsy.

166
00:16:28,715 --> 00:16:31,070
- No bones?
- No bones.

167
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:35,470
- Any contusions or lacerations?
- Not a trace.

168
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:38,428
That's why we're tossing it
into your lap.

169
00:16:38,635 --> 00:16:41,707
I hate to disappoint you, but I've
never heard of anything like this.

170
00:16:43,195 --> 00:16:44,469
What was the medical history?

171
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:47,587
Practically no medical history.
He was a strong, healthy farmer.

172
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:50,912
- Interesting problem, eh?
- Very. I'd like to see the body.

173
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:54,034
I was going to have a look
at it myself. Like to come?

174
00:16:54,235 --> 00:16:55,509
- Yes.
- Good.

175
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:58,183
I'm sure they'll call it
"West's Disease".

176
00:16:58,395 --> 00:17:00,590
This sudden humility
astounds me!

177
00:17:00,795 --> 00:17:03,389
They've named so many after me,
it'll cause confusion.

178
00:17:04,115 --> 00:17:07,312
- When are you leaving?
- Tonight. We'll need a plane.

179
00:17:07,995 --> 00:17:10,634
- You could use my father's plane.
- We need a sea plane.

180
00:17:10,955 --> 00:17:12,786
- It's a helicopter.
- That's nice of you, Toni.

181
00:17:12,995 --> 00:17:15,111
- There's a catch.
- I should've known.

182
00:17:15,315 --> 00:17:18,068
- I'm going with you.
- We don't know what we're up against.

183
00:17:18,475 --> 00:17:21,865
It's an unknown disease,
we can't anticipate the effects.

184
00:17:22,475 --> 00:17:23,988
Nevertheless, I'm going.

185
00:17:24,595 --> 00:17:27,314
- Time is important.
- Quite so, quite.

186
00:17:27,635 --> 00:17:29,227
Yes, I know.

187
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:32,709
Very well, we accept
your offer and the condition.

188
00:17:32,915 --> 00:17:35,634
If you'll excuse me,
I'll telephone my father.

189
00:17:37,755 --> 00:17:40,474
We'll stop by my lab
and pick up some equipment.

190
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:44,112
I can't wait for you. Your father
needs the helicopter.

191
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,146
That's all right, is it?

192
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:47,674
We don't have much choice.

193
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,469
I'll come back in a couple
of days.

194
00:17:50,675 --> 00:17:53,906
- Right.
- We'll be marooned on the island.

195
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:57,109
We won't have any contact
with the mainland.

196
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:59,590
I can't take
the emergency launch back.

197
00:17:59,835 --> 00:18:03,066
It's too late for other arrangements.
We'll have to make do.

198
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:06,108
I had no idea my father
would need the helicopter.

199
00:18:06,315 --> 00:18:09,068
What did Napoleon do on that island
of his to him busy?

200
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:10,913
He invented solitaire.

201
00:18:11,115 --> 00:18:14,232
- I've a much better game in mind.
- Can three play?

202
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,787
Fascinating game, solitaire.

203
00:20:22,795 --> 00:20:25,992
- Hello, John. How's Mrs. Bellows?
- Those pills did the trick.

204
00:20:26,195 --> 00:20:27,344
Good.

205
00:20:27,675 --> 00:20:30,314
Constable Harris,
may I introduce Dr. Stanley,

206
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,904
- Miss Merrill and Dr. West.
- How do you do?

207
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:35,470
- Does anybody know about Ian?
- No.

208
00:20:35,675 --> 00:20:38,633
- Have you been in touch with Philips?
- No, he's not been down.

209
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:41,144
Philips?
Dr. Lawrence Philips.

210
00:20:41,355 --> 00:20:43,505
Oh, Dr. Philips!
What's he doing out here?

211
00:20:43,915 --> 00:20:46,907
- This is where he set up his lab.
- He could be of great help.

212
00:20:47,155 --> 00:20:49,794
You've got to get to him first.
He's a recluse.

213
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,992
Who is he?
What does he do?

214
00:20:52,195 --> 00:20:53,787
Top man in cancer research.

215
00:20:54,275 --> 00:20:56,345
Before we do anything,
let's see that body.

216
00:21:01,995 --> 00:21:03,633
Not a very pretty sight.

217
00:21:14,115 --> 00:21:16,993
I intend to make
the first incision here. Agreed?

218
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:18,310
Agreed.

219
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:32,312
Here's something interesting.

220
00:21:34,075 --> 00:21:37,750
There are a series of minute
punctures in this dermal segment.

221
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,030
That's odd.

222
00:21:40,235 --> 00:21:42,271
Let's collect segments
from other parts of the body.

223
00:21:42,475 --> 00:21:44,670
Try staining it with eosin.

224
00:21:51,835 --> 00:21:55,032
- It's the same with all of them.
- They're all over the body.

225
00:21:55,235 --> 00:21:57,749
I've never seen anything
like these punctures before.

226
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:00,515
Could something have entered
the body through them?

227
00:22:00,715 --> 00:22:03,787
- Like what, for instance?
- It's possible some enzyme

228
00:22:03,995 --> 00:22:06,031
was introduced into the body
through the punctures.

229
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:10,672
If they are punctures. I can't tell
if they're punctures or ruptures.

230
00:22:11,035 --> 00:22:14,994
Something came out or some organism
producing an enzyme went in.

231
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:18,350
There's no trace of calcium
phosphate in the body.

232
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:21,469
Then this enzyme,
or whatever it is,

233
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,587
seems to attack and break down
the calcium phosphate.

234
00:22:24,795 --> 00:22:27,514
A major component of human bone.

235
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:29,706
We don't know
if there's a connection

236
00:22:29,915 --> 00:22:32,554
between the perforations
and the absence of bone.

237
00:22:32,755 --> 00:22:35,428
They could be two evidences
of a similar syndrome.

238
00:22:36,195 --> 00:22:37,594
We'll have to assume it.

239
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:40,184
If we only had more complete
facilities.

240
00:22:40,395 --> 00:22:43,228
There's Philips' lab,
but I don't know if he'll talk to us.

241
00:22:44,275 --> 00:22:46,391
- He'll talk to me.
- How well equipped is he?

242
00:22:46,595 --> 00:22:49,234
I've never seen it,
but I believe it's complete.

243
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:52,306
Don't say the lights
are going to fail.

244
00:22:52,515 --> 00:22:54,506
We've had trouble
with the generator.

245
00:22:54,715 --> 00:22:57,104
- Let's get out to Philips' place.
- All right.

246
00:22:57,315 --> 00:23:00,751
I'd better leave a note
for Constable Harris at his house.

247
00:23:12,235 --> 00:23:14,829
What a climate!
How do they stay healthy?

248
00:23:15,635 --> 00:23:17,830
Does that generator supply
all this island?

249
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:21,630
All the electrical power. I've been
after them for months to fix it.

250
00:23:22,115 --> 00:23:24,834
- Is that the house up there?
- That's it.

251
00:23:25,315 --> 00:23:27,670
Good Lord, it looks like
"Wuthering Heights".

252
00:23:53,035 --> 00:23:54,627
Try again.

253
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:58,310
I don't think it'll do much good.

254
00:24:00,995 --> 00:24:03,384
We must get into that lab somehow.

255
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,867
- I'll look around. Got a torch?
- Yes, I have.

256
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:11,673
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

257
00:24:11,875 --> 00:24:14,230
Wait here.
I'll find a way in.

258
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:18,508
- I've found another body.
- The same as the other?

259
00:26:29,755 --> 00:26:33,031
- Where's the laboratory?
- I don't know. I've never been here.

260
00:26:33,235 --> 00:26:34,350
We'll find it.

261
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:49,313
Let's try down here!

262
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:25,352
Isotopes. He's got as much equipment
here as I have at the University.

263
00:27:27,635 --> 00:27:28,954
There's the lab.

264
00:27:52,395 --> 00:27:54,226
There's one over here, as well.

265
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:01,473
Were there signs of a struggle
with Bellows?

266
00:28:01,675 --> 00:28:04,064
You couldn't tell,
it was in a cave.

267
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:08,064
Philips had no contact in the village.
It's not a contagious disease.

268
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:11,028
Whatever it was,
it must've started in this lab.

269
00:28:11,235 --> 00:28:13,191
Bellows' body was found
not far away.

270
00:28:13,395 --> 00:28:16,990
If it did start here, it might be
moving down towards the village.

271
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,425
Well, they were either fighting
something,

272
00:28:19,635 --> 00:28:21,830
or the death throes
were violent.

273
00:28:22,475 --> 00:28:24,705
Why don't we study
Philips' notes?

274
00:28:24,915 --> 00:28:27,713
- It could give us a lead.
- All right.

275
00:29:27,595 --> 00:29:29,904
All right, hold on, I'm coming!

276
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:36,185
Come in, you're in time for tea.

277
00:29:36,395 --> 00:29:40,229
John, I found one of my horses dead.

278
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:44,587
At least I think it's one of
my horses, it's all soft and flabby.

279
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:48,790
- Where did it happen?
- In my field.

280
00:29:49,595 --> 00:29:51,426
I've got to tell Dr. Landers.

281
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:54,069
He's at Philips' place,
according to this note.

282
00:29:54,275 --> 00:29:56,152
Then I'll take a look
at your horse.

283
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:59,711
- Don't mention this to anyone.
- Why not?

284
00:29:59,915 --> 00:30:03,590
Don't ask foolish questions,
do as I say. Now, go on.

285
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,911
I'll let you know everything
in a while.

286
00:30:15,995 --> 00:30:18,463
You get started,
I'll tell Harris we're back.

287
00:30:18,675 --> 00:30:20,631
Right. Meet us here,
we've a lot to read.

288
00:30:20,835 --> 00:30:22,268
I'll be back shortly.

289
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:27,951
I could do with food and coffee.
It's been a hard day.

290
00:31:08,115 --> 00:31:09,468
Doctor Landers?

291
00:31:26,475 --> 00:31:27,954
Doctor Landers?

292
00:31:53,115 --> 00:31:54,833
Doctor Landers!

293
00:32:20,995 --> 00:32:22,348
Doctor Landers?

294
00:34:03,635 --> 00:34:06,195
It was a horrible
looking mess.

295
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:07,949
- Good morning, doctor.
- Morning.

296
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:11,426
- Has anyone seen Constable Harris?
- He said he'd meet you at Philips'.

297
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,195
He's gone up to my fields
to look at my horse.

298
00:34:14,395 --> 00:34:16,750
- What's that?
- He's gone to Philips' place.

299
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:19,185
My horse is dead
and he's gone up there.

300
00:34:19,395 --> 00:34:22,546
- What happened to your horse?
- If it is my horse.

301
00:34:22,915 --> 00:34:25,383
It's a bloody mess,
a pile of flesh.

302
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:27,866
- In your fields?
- Yes.

303
00:34:29,195 --> 00:34:32,107
- The other side of the island...
- Pardon?

304
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:35,074
Nothing. Excuse me,
I've got to go.

305
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:38,267
- Wait, what's going on here?
- I can't explain now.

306
00:34:39,515 --> 00:34:42,666
Some peculiar goings on
on this island.

307
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:46,355
It was a bit abrupt
on the doctor's part.

308
00:34:47,555 --> 00:34:51,343
He may be right.
I'll go and see Campbell.

309
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:04,671
You're the head of the island,
what do you plan to do?

310
00:35:04,875 --> 00:35:06,911
It's no good dithering about.

311
00:35:07,115 --> 00:35:10,710
We better go and talk to the farmers
and then see Dr. Landers.

312
00:35:19,715 --> 00:35:23,230
A farmer has found his horse
on the other side of the peninsula.

313
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:27,594
Harris has gone to Philips' place.
We must've just missed him.

314
00:35:27,995 --> 00:35:31,465
- Did you find anything?
- Philips was doing cancer research.

315
00:35:31,675 --> 00:35:35,907
He was creating a form of living
matter to counteract the cancer.

316
00:35:36,115 --> 00:35:37,343
What do you think?

317
00:35:37,555 --> 00:35:41,104
He might've succeeded in creating
some form of life in his lair.

318
00:35:41,315 --> 00:35:44,307
- That caused these deaths?
- We haven't read all his notes.

319
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,795
Shall we take a look at the horse,
and pick up Harris?

320
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:50,953
We should let him know
at least what we know.

321
00:35:51,155 --> 00:35:52,907
- Good morning.
- Hello, Toni.

322
00:35:53,115 --> 00:35:55,151
You look like you've been up
all night.

323
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:56,504
We have.

324
00:35:56,715 --> 00:35:59,627
- How about some breakfast?
- We've just had supper.

325
00:35:59,835 --> 00:36:02,474
- We have to go to Philips' place.
- Right, let's go.

326
00:36:02,675 --> 00:36:05,269
- I'm afraid you can't come.
- Why not?

327
00:36:05,995 --> 00:36:08,748
- It might be dangerous.
- What might?

328
00:36:09,195 --> 00:36:12,744
Look, last night we went up there
and found four more bodies.

329
00:36:13,555 --> 00:36:17,548
We think they created something in
that lab that's causing these deaths.

330
00:36:17,755 --> 00:36:19,711
- What do you mean "something"?
- Just that...

331
00:36:19,955 --> 00:36:21,547
We don't know, yet.

332
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:25,704
If you there's something running
loose, you can't leave me alone!

333
00:36:25,915 --> 00:36:29,146
- Toni, this could be...
- Please! Don't leave me alone.

334
00:36:32,915 --> 00:36:33,950
Perhaps you're right.

335
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:53,790
Oh, no!

336
00:37:01,595 --> 00:37:04,553
- What's happened?
- Something was on the rear window.

337
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:06,632
- What?
- I'm not quite sure.

338
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:09,110
- What did it look like?
- It was...

339
00:37:09,315 --> 00:37:11,624
I don't know, it was greyish.

340
00:37:11,835 --> 00:37:15,225
- Think, this is important.
- There was a strange sound.

341
00:37:15,435 --> 00:37:17,471
- What kind of a sound?
- I don't know...

342
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:19,108
Let's have a look.

343
00:37:30,515 --> 00:37:33,712
Brian, hold it!
Come back to the car.

344
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:41,783
We better not get too close
until we know what we're up against.

345
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:42,984
What do you think it is?

346
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:45,789
I don't know,
but let's not take any risks.

347
00:37:45,995 --> 00:37:47,269
Especially with me.

348
00:37:47,475 --> 00:37:50,228
We better get Harris and get back,
we might need help.

349
00:38:28,315 --> 00:38:31,432
- He must be here, that's his bicycle.
- Toni, stay in the car.

350
00:38:31,675 --> 00:38:33,506
No, not with those things
around.

351
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:36,183
Let her come, I wouldn't
want to stay here alone.

352
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:38,306
OK, but stick close together.

353
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:41,984
Harris?

354
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:44,627
Constable Harris?

355
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:46,274
Harris?

356
00:38:48,195 --> 00:38:50,026
Let's see if he's in the basement.

357
00:38:58,075 --> 00:38:59,269
Harris?

358
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:03,829
Look! It's Harris.

359
00:39:22,355 --> 00:39:23,868
Good Lord, what's that?

360
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:28,707
Let's get out of here.

361
00:40:01,035 --> 00:40:02,468
Don't get too close!

362
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:08,594
They've divided!

363
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:15,269
- Let's get through them.
- Wait!

364
00:41:15,475 --> 00:41:17,033
Let me try first.

365
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:32,270
Come on!

366
00:41:33,475 --> 00:41:34,794
No, no.

367
00:41:34,995 --> 00:41:37,668
- We've got to. Now. Come on!
- No!

368
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:40,794
Hurry! They may not remain
inactive long.

369
00:41:40,995 --> 00:41:43,555
Listen! They're inactive
because they divided

370
00:41:43,755 --> 00:41:46,223
but we don't know for how long,
So, come on!

371
00:41:46,435 --> 00:41:49,108
- David, I'm so frightened.
- So am I.

372
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,233
- Are you all right?
- No!

373
00:41:55,515 --> 00:41:58,188
- There's one out here.
- Into the car, quick!

374
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,549
Damn!

375
00:42:23,995 --> 00:42:26,145
- Hurry!
- I'm trying!

376
00:42:32,075 --> 00:42:33,554
I think that's got it.

377
00:42:59,915 --> 00:43:01,268
Here, take this.

378
00:43:01,555 --> 00:43:04,627
- Come on, drink it.
- Oh, David...

379
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:06,109
Come on.

380
00:43:06,835 --> 00:43:09,986
I want you to get some sleep
and this will do the trick.

381
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:15,154
I'm so scared.
I've never seen anyone die before.

382
00:43:15,355 --> 00:43:19,234
Now, don't think about it.
We'll find an answer, we've got to.

383
00:43:19,435 --> 00:43:23,872
- I never saw anything so horrible.
- Me neither.

384
00:43:24,715 --> 00:43:27,832
Now, you just relax
and try and get some sleep.

385
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:32,071
- What's going to happen to us?
- Nothing, we'll be all right.

386
00:43:32,595 --> 00:43:34,870
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

387
00:43:35,875 --> 00:43:40,471
- I'm sorry I ever brought you here.
- There's no reason to be sorry.

388
00:43:40,995 --> 00:43:42,713
I wanted to come.

389
00:43:44,715 --> 00:43:46,433
- David?
- Yes.

390
00:43:47,235 --> 00:43:49,191
Are you really sorry I came?

391
00:43:54,235 --> 00:43:57,352
- I won't let you down.
- I know you won't.

392
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:01,112
We'll get out of this somehow.

393
00:44:06,715 --> 00:44:07,989
Somehow.

394
00:44:45,235 --> 00:44:47,351
- How is she?
- I gave her a sedative.

395
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:49,671
Good. I could do
with a sedative myself.

396
00:44:49,875 --> 00:44:51,274
What did you find out?

397
00:44:51,475 --> 00:44:54,592
They're in chronological order.
The last one is a few days old.

398
00:44:54,795 --> 00:44:55,830
What's the entry?

399
00:44:56,035 --> 00:44:59,311
It's about Phillips' dog-getting
an overdose of radiation.

400
00:44:59,515 --> 00:45:00,868
Anything else?

401
00:45:01,355 --> 00:45:05,109
They attempted to fuse the nucleus
but look at this protein structure:

402
00:45:05,315 --> 00:45:07,590
It isn't adenosine triphosphate.

403
00:45:31,995 --> 00:45:35,067
Where have you been?
I've come for my goods.

404
00:45:35,275 --> 00:45:37,835
Sorry, Jonesy,
the store's closed today.

405
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:41,072
- Have you seen Dr. Landers?
- Not since 7 this morning.

406
00:45:41,275 --> 00:45:43,630
He left in his car
with two men and a girl.

407
00:45:43,835 --> 00:45:45,587
- Strangers.
- What strangers?

408
00:45:45,795 --> 00:45:47,786
The ones that came in
on the plane, last night.

409
00:45:48,195 --> 00:45:49,548
What plane? Where are they?

410
00:45:50,235 --> 00:45:52,749
- Maybe they've over at the inn.
- Come on.

411
00:45:55,515 --> 00:45:56,948
What about my goods?

412
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:00,553
If you check that
with 404, you see?

413
00:46:04,915 --> 00:46:07,873
Hello. Are you the folk
that are with Dr. Landers?

414
00:46:08,075 --> 00:46:09,667
We've been working with him.
Who are you?

415
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:14,147
I'm Campbell, head of the island.
This is Argyle who runs the store.

416
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,107
I'm Dr. West
and this is Dr. Stanley.

417
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,270
How do you do?

418
00:46:17,475 --> 00:46:20,194
And where's the Doc?
Dr. Landers?

419
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:23,834
I'm afraid Dr. Landers is dead.

420
00:46:26,155 --> 00:46:29,830
Dr. Landers dead!
How did it happen?

421
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:32,229
Please sit down.

422
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:40,784
Well?

423
00:46:42,315 --> 00:46:44,510
Now this is very difficult
to explain.

424
00:46:44,715 --> 00:46:47,388
There are creatures loose here
and they're dangerous.

425
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:49,706
What do you mean?
What are they?

426
00:46:50,475 --> 00:46:54,548
We're not sure, but we think they're
due to Dr. Philips' experiments.

427
00:46:55,275 --> 00:46:56,594
What do you mean "creatures"?

428
00:46:57,195 --> 00:47:00,187
I wish I could tell you more,
but we don't know what they are.

429
00:47:00,795 --> 00:47:04,470
- Creatures?
- Doctor, this is a bit hard to take.

430
00:47:05,835 --> 00:47:08,110
I assure you we're not mad.

431
00:47:09,435 --> 00:47:13,826
Dr. Philips', created some kind
of living organism that kills.

432
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:18,988
That's what happened to Dr. Landers?
Yes.

433
00:47:19,995 --> 00:47:23,032
We'll need your help
if this island is to survive.

434
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:26,992
- Survive?
- What do you want us to do?

435
00:47:27,675 --> 00:47:30,872
First of all, I'll need
ten good men beside yourselves.

436
00:47:31,475 --> 00:47:34,433
- I can find those for you all right.
- Good.

437
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:37,308
I want all the villagers together
in an hour.

438
00:47:37,875 --> 00:47:39,513
That's short notice.

439
00:47:39,835 --> 00:47:42,190
We can gather
in the meeting hall.

440
00:47:42,595 --> 00:47:45,109
Right. I'll let you know
everything more fully then.

441
00:47:46,795 --> 00:47:51,107
- We'd better tell the Constable.
- I'm sorry, you're late. He's dead.

442
00:47:51,555 --> 00:47:54,115
- The Constable too?
- Yes, and Ian Bellows.

443
00:47:56,555 --> 00:47:59,627
You know, we've had
reports of animals dying.

444
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,269
- It seems as if they had no bones.
- Where?

445
00:48:02,475 --> 00:48:05,069
Several places.
In the northern part of the island.

446
00:48:05,275 --> 00:48:08,824
- Has anything occurred in the centre?
- No, just north of the centre.

447
00:48:09,035 --> 00:48:10,912
- We haven't time, they're moving.
- How many?

448
00:48:11,115 --> 00:48:13,549
We'll explain at the hall,
we must finish these notes.

449
00:48:13,755 --> 00:48:15,825
- We'll do as you say.
- Thank you.

450
00:48:16,075 --> 00:48:19,192
- Now they tried experiment 1165...
- Yes.

451
00:48:19,395 --> 00:48:22,751
And if you compare that with 1143,
the results were negative.

452
00:48:32,835 --> 00:48:35,713
Quiet! Quiet, please!

453
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,588
Now, that's all we know
at the moment.

454
00:48:52,195 --> 00:48:56,313
Your attention, please.
I'm Dr. West and this is Dr. Stanley.

455
00:48:56,515 --> 00:48:58,949
We've completed going over
Dr. Philips' notes

456
00:48:59,155 --> 00:49:03,114
and I must warn you that we're in
a dangerous situation. Dr. Stanley?

457
00:49:04,755 --> 00:49:07,428
Let me explain what
we've discovered so far.

458
00:49:08,635 --> 00:49:11,024
In order to understand
the nature of cancer,

459
00:49:11,235 --> 00:49:13,795
Dr. Philips was trying
to create living cells.

460
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:16,864
Cells that he hoped
would attack the cancer.

461
00:49:17,315 --> 00:49:21,513
He based this on the carbon atom
which is the basis of all life.

462
00:49:21,755 --> 00:49:22,983
He didn't succeed.

463
00:49:23,795 --> 00:49:27,947
But he probably created a form
of life based on the silicon atom.

464
00:49:28,155 --> 00:49:31,511
Now these Silicates,
as we call them, eat animal bone,

465
00:49:32,555 --> 00:49:33,704
human bone.

466
00:49:33,915 --> 00:49:36,987
Dr. Philips' gave life
to some kind of organism,

467
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:39,386
something we know nothing about.

468
00:49:39,835 --> 00:49:43,510
Their external skeletal structure
is tough and resilient.

469
00:49:43,715 --> 00:49:46,866
We couldn't hurt it with an axe and
when run over, it was unharmed.

470
00:49:48,435 --> 00:49:51,188
We haven't found
a way to destroy them yet,

471
00:49:51,395 --> 00:49:53,386
but shall attack them
with everything we can.

472
00:49:54,355 --> 00:49:57,153
From Dr. Philips' notes
and our own experience,

473
00:49:57,355 --> 00:50:00,347
we calculate that these creatures
divide every six hours.

474
00:50:01,315 --> 00:50:04,512
There are about 64 silicates
on the island at this moment.

475
00:50:04,715 --> 00:50:07,183
There'll be 128
by six o'clock this evening.

476
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:11,628
- 256 by midnight.
- What?

477
00:50:11,995 --> 00:50:15,908
And if this continues, at the end
of the week, there'll be a million.

478
00:50:17,315 --> 00:50:20,148
Please, I must have your attention!

479
00:50:20,675 --> 00:50:24,748
The only way to stop them if all
else fails, is to deny them food.

480
00:50:24,955 --> 00:50:27,423
We want you to move
into this building with supplies,

481
00:50:27,635 --> 00:50:29,705
round up the cattle
and bring it here.

482
00:50:32,075 --> 00:50:33,474
We must keep calm.

483
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:37,111
Fear and panic will defeat us
just as surely as the Silicates.

484
00:50:37,475 --> 00:50:41,184
We need your help and co-operation.
We must work together.

485
00:50:42,155 --> 00:50:43,270
Thank you.

486
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:49,790
Right. The following men meet me
in the room out the back there.

487
00:50:50,195 --> 00:50:52,106
Er... Morton...

488
00:50:52,355 --> 00:50:53,788
Er... Dunley...

489
00:50:54,275 --> 00:50:56,311
- Are there any guns on the island?
- Plenty.

490
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,109
- And dynamite?
- I've got three cases.

491
00:50:59,315 --> 00:51:02,307
We ought to make petrol bombs,
we don't know what'll work.

492
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:06,794
We'll send out three scouts:
Here, here and there.

493
00:51:07,515 --> 00:51:09,312
Dunley, you and two others.

494
00:51:09,795 --> 00:51:13,629
The rest of you gather up
the equipment and meet here.

495
00:51:14,355 --> 00:51:16,471
You all know
the groups assigned to you.

496
00:51:17,075 --> 00:51:19,305
Williams and Martindale,
round up the cattle

497
00:51:19,755 --> 00:51:21,347
and bring them along
to William's field there,

498
00:51:21,755 --> 00:51:22,744
by the village.

499
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:25,266
Right, let's get moving.

500
00:51:27,635 --> 00:51:30,547
Can I rely on you to see
that everything's fine at the hall?

501
00:51:30,755 --> 00:51:32,746
- Yes, of course, I think I can cope.
- Fine.

502
00:51:32,955 --> 00:51:35,071
Now make sure all the supplies
are organised properly

503
00:51:35,275 --> 00:51:36,833
and try and keep them
from panicking.

504
00:51:37,035 --> 00:51:38,912
- I will. David...
- Hm?

505
00:51:39,115 --> 00:51:41,913
- Take care.
- I'll do my best.

506
00:51:42,555 --> 00:51:45,911
Don't worry, we'll be back,
whether we destroy them or not.

507
00:51:57,755 --> 00:52:01,543
- How many can you count?
- About 25, as far as I can see.

508
00:52:07,755 --> 00:52:09,268
- Got everything?
- I think so.

509
00:52:09,475 --> 00:52:10,828
- Where's the Geiger counter?
- Why?

510
00:52:11,035 --> 00:52:14,107
If they're radioactive,
we'll have to protect ourselves.

511
00:52:14,315 --> 00:52:15,384
Give us a hand.

512
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,710
Halsey,
your group take the dynamite.

513
00:52:20,915 --> 00:52:23,383
Morton, you bring the petrol bombs.

514
00:53:08,515 --> 00:53:10,631
It's no good,
we hit it several times.

515
00:53:26,075 --> 00:53:28,305
They don't seem
to be moving very fast.

516
00:53:29,275 --> 00:53:31,425
I'll cross that one's trail
and get a Geiger reading.

517
00:53:31,635 --> 00:53:34,308
- Careful. Don't get too near.
- Don't worry.

518
00:54:08,315 --> 00:54:10,067
Careful! Behind you!

519
00:54:18,995 --> 00:54:21,907
- Nasty little creatures.
- We better try the petrol bombs.

520
00:54:22,115 --> 00:54:24,151
There wasn't any sign
of radioactivity.

521
00:54:24,355 --> 00:54:25,947
That's something, anyway.

522
00:54:27,915 --> 00:54:29,553
The rest of you stay here.

523
00:54:57,755 --> 00:55:00,906
- I'll get up closer.
- All right, but watch it.

524
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:33,628
Try another!

525
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,390
Hey, stop, come back here!

526
00:55:51,035 --> 00:55:52,753
Let's try the dynamite.

527
00:56:10,955 --> 00:56:12,468
Right, everybody spread out.

528
00:56:21,555 --> 00:56:22,954
All right, light them up.

529
00:57:08,915 --> 00:57:10,746
Nothing gets through to them.

530
00:57:10,955 --> 00:57:13,344
At this rate, they'll reach the village
by midnight.

531
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,466
What else could we do?

532
00:57:16,515 --> 00:57:18,710
- Starve them.
- Mr. Campbell!

533
00:57:20,115 --> 00:57:23,312
- What is it, Dunley?
- In Parson's Cove...

534
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:27,467
It's one of the Silicates. It's dead.

535
00:57:28,275 --> 00:57:30,789
- Are you sure?
- It hasn't moved in 20 minutes.

536
00:57:31,675 --> 00:57:32,869
And another thing,

537
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:37,546
that Great Dane of Philips'
is nearby. Half eaten.

538
00:57:38,315 --> 00:57:39,543
Philips' dog!

539
00:57:39,755 --> 00:57:42,428
Remember, the dog
had an overdose of radiation.

540
00:57:42,635 --> 00:57:44,353
Let's have the Geiger counter.

541
00:57:58,235 --> 00:58:00,544
Here it is,
and the dog's over there.

542
00:58:40,115 --> 00:58:42,151
It's loaded with radioactivity.

543
00:58:49,795 --> 00:58:51,228
Radioactive too.

544
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:55,867
Let's put them on the truck
and take them to the clinic.

545
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:07,234
Take it round the back!

546
00:59:11,395 --> 00:59:14,353
David, I'm so glad you're here,
they're starting to panic.

547
00:59:14,635 --> 00:59:16,034
All right, take it easy.

548
00:59:18,075 --> 00:59:19,872
Please listen to me.

549
00:59:20,755 --> 00:59:23,144
Will you listen to me, PLEASE!

550
00:59:24,155 --> 00:59:26,589
I've something
of great importance to tell you.

551
00:59:27,155 --> 00:59:29,589
I think we've found a way
to destroy the Silicates.

552
00:59:29,795 --> 00:59:32,104
But we'll need the help
of everyone here.

553
00:59:32,315 --> 00:59:35,352
We'll examine a dead one and I think
it'll give us what we need.

554
00:59:35,555 --> 00:59:39,389
Meanwhile, stay here
and do as Miss Merrill says.

555
00:59:40,355 --> 00:59:41,310
Can you stop them?

556
00:59:41,515 --> 00:59:44,587
Keep the people here,
and keep them busy at all costs.

557
00:59:44,795 --> 00:59:47,184
- What have you found out?
- I've no time to explain.

558
00:59:47,395 --> 00:59:49,511
We'll be in the clinic
if you need us.

559
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:57,026
The outer shell is impenetrable.
We've done everything to pierce it.

560
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:59,385
- But radiation will kill them.
- How?

561
00:59:59,595 --> 01:00:03,144
The dog was contaminated with
strontium, that effects the bone.

562
01:00:03,355 --> 01:00:06,028
It ate the bone plus the strontium,
that's why it died.

563
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,510
How can we introduce the radiation
into their systems?

564
01:00:09,075 --> 01:00:10,064
Can it be done?

565
01:00:10,275 --> 01:00:12,072
Philips' had a supply of isotopes.

566
01:00:12,435 --> 01:00:16,189
If we can get enough Strontium 90,
we can contaminate the cattle.

567
01:00:16,395 --> 01:00:18,955
The Silicates eat the cattle...
It's a hope.

568
01:00:19,155 --> 01:00:23,194
Can you move the cattle closer,
to keep them safe until we're ready?

569
01:00:23,595 --> 01:00:25,233
We can put them
in my cattle yard.

570
01:00:25,635 --> 01:00:28,945
Then do so. Dr. Stanley and I
are going up to Philips' place.

571
01:00:29,155 --> 01:00:32,227
Now if we don't come back,
you'll have to get the Strontium 90.

572
01:00:32,435 --> 01:00:35,029
- But we don't know...
- We'll tell you what to do.

573
01:00:51,835 --> 01:00:53,507
Dave, stop the car.

574
01:00:57,715 --> 01:00:59,990
- What is it?
- Look over there. Silicates.

575
01:01:03,515 --> 01:01:05,107
There are more of them.

576
01:01:35,755 --> 01:01:38,588
I'm not keen on going down
in that cellar again.

577
01:01:48,635 --> 01:01:50,068
It looks safe.

578
01:02:02,115 --> 01:02:06,870
There must be some instrument that
they used to contaminate the animals.

579
01:02:07,075 --> 01:02:08,554
I'll have a look around.

580
01:02:13,315 --> 01:02:15,988
- What about this?
- That's it.

581
01:02:16,275 --> 01:02:17,788
Better put these on.

582
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:04,070
- I forgot the gloves.
- I'll put this in the car.

583
01:05:45,235 --> 01:05:46,668
David!

584
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:49,588
David!

585
01:06:05,635 --> 01:06:08,354
- Brian, I...
- You must, you must!

586
01:06:28,755 --> 01:06:30,108
Can you hold that?

587
01:06:31,555 --> 01:06:33,466
Keys, in the boot.

588
01:06:44,795 --> 01:06:46,865
Try and hang on
until we get back.

589
01:07:04,555 --> 01:07:06,864
- Thank you, nurse.
- How are you feeling?

590
01:07:07,195 --> 01:07:09,425
- As well as can be expected.
- He's had a lot of pain.

591
01:07:09,635 --> 01:07:12,024
- Not much.
- I'll give you another morphine.

592
01:07:12,235 --> 01:07:15,864
First a sloppy bit of surgery and now
you're turning me into a drug addict.

593
01:07:16,075 --> 01:07:17,986
- It's your choice.
- I don't need it.

594
01:07:18,195 --> 01:07:21,028
All right, but we'll give you
another transfusion.

595
01:07:21,595 --> 01:07:24,428
One more, and I'll be
a full-blooded Irishman.

596
01:07:24,675 --> 01:07:26,074
I think he's feeling better.

597
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:06,592
- Is that all the cattle?
- That's all.

598
01:08:06,795 --> 01:08:09,514
Most of them.
Very few escaped the round-up.

599
01:08:09,915 --> 01:08:12,270
Let's hope
we've got enough Strontium 90.

600
01:08:19,395 --> 01:08:21,067
Herd them through one at a time.

601
01:09:05,155 --> 01:09:06,383
That's the lot.

602
01:09:07,835 --> 01:09:09,826
I had to cut down the shots
on the last few.

603
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:12,424
- Do you think it'll be enough?
- I don't know.

604
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:15,354
Let's get back,
and get those lights strung up.

605
01:09:16,515 --> 01:09:17,914
You've done it.

606
01:09:18,555 --> 01:09:20,546
- Give us a bulb.
- Here, take this.

607
01:09:22,035 --> 01:09:24,185
Yeah, that's it.

608
01:09:24,835 --> 01:09:26,632
What if it doesn't work?

609
01:09:27,835 --> 01:09:29,951
Then we'll just have to
wait for help.

610
01:09:30,155 --> 01:09:33,386
Our biggest worry is that they'll
panic. They must understand.

611
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:36,309
They're scared to death...
So am I.

612
01:09:36,515 --> 01:09:39,188
We're all scared. If they go
outside, it's certain death.

613
01:09:39,395 --> 01:09:41,351
Those things will be
all over the building.

614
01:09:41,555 --> 01:09:43,432
Probably.
Now, look,

615
01:09:43,635 --> 01:09:46,024
you must keep the people
calm, they trust you.

616
01:09:46,235 --> 01:09:47,509
I'll do my best.

617
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:55,550
The lights are a strain
on the generator.

618
01:09:55,755 --> 01:09:59,111
- That'd really cause a panic.
- I've got torches and candles.

619
01:09:59,315 --> 01:10:02,546
- I hope we don't need them.
- We've food for a week.

620
01:10:02,755 --> 01:10:04,507
You must convince the villagers.

621
01:10:04,715 --> 01:10:08,230
Our one hope is that they'll starve
if the Strontium doesn't work,

622
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:11,154
or at least the lack of food
may cut down the multiplication.

623
01:10:11,355 --> 01:10:14,665
- Are you going to have a look?
- Yes, but first I'll see Stanley.

624
01:10:14,955 --> 01:10:16,752
I'll talk to the people.

625
01:10:17,035 --> 01:10:19,788
You move around amongst them
and keep them occupied.

626
01:10:19,995 --> 01:10:22,145
Get help from Dunley
and some of the others.

627
01:10:22,355 --> 01:10:23,549
Good.

628
01:10:23,835 --> 01:10:27,874
I've injected the cattle but
we ran short of the Strontium 90.

629
01:10:28,155 --> 01:10:29,952
I had to cut down
on the last few.

630
01:10:30,155 --> 01:10:34,353
If it doesn't work, we'll wait until
the helicopter or boat arrives.

631
01:10:34,795 --> 01:10:38,708
- When will the Silicates get here?
- It's a little after ten.

632
01:10:39,035 --> 01:10:41,913
According to the last positions,
in about an hour and a half.

633
01:10:42,115 --> 01:10:43,787
What about the division time?

634
01:10:44,555 --> 01:10:48,389
That may take some time
and there aren't that many cattle.

635
01:10:48,715 --> 01:10:50,148
You get some rest.

636
01:10:50,555 --> 01:10:52,193
A perfect time for a nap.

637
01:10:52,395 --> 01:10:55,467
You will let me know if anything
unusual happens, won't you?

638
01:10:57,275 --> 01:10:58,754
We've got to get out of here.

639
01:10:58,995 --> 01:11:02,431
Where can we go?
We can't reach the mainland.

640
01:11:02,835 --> 01:11:05,668
If you'd seen what it did to Archie,
you'd swim.

641
01:11:05,875 --> 01:11:06,990
Halsey!

642
01:11:07,995 --> 01:11:09,553
Shut up.

643
01:11:10,075 --> 01:11:11,508
Listen all of you,

644
01:11:12,075 --> 01:11:14,794
if anyone leaves this building,
they'll be killed for sure.

645
01:11:14,995 --> 01:11:18,624
We're safe enough in here, we've got
enough food and water to wait.

646
01:11:18,915 --> 01:11:20,792
I'm so frightened, Mr. Campbell.

647
01:11:20,995 --> 01:11:23,555
If you do as we say,
you've nothing to fear.

648
01:11:23,755 --> 01:11:25,552
- Will you trust me?
- Yes.

649
01:11:28,075 --> 01:11:30,589
Now, listen, Halsey,
and listen well.

650
01:11:30,955 --> 01:11:35,585
If I hear another sound out of you,
I'll throw you out for those things.

651
01:11:35,795 --> 01:11:37,626
I'm talking straight,
understand?

652
01:11:37,835 --> 01:11:40,872
- Mr. Campbell, I can't stand it...
- Do you understand?

653
01:11:41,315 --> 01:11:42,794
Mind that you do.

654
01:11:44,235 --> 01:11:48,228
There's nothing to fear. We'll be
all right as long as we stay here.

655
01:11:48,435 --> 01:11:50,312
- Are you sure?
- Sure.

656
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:53,154
Why, I've stuffed this place
with supplies on credit.

657
01:11:55,395 --> 01:11:57,431
He's a much better colour,
he'll rest now.

658
01:11:57,755 --> 01:11:58,949
Now what?

659
01:11:59,275 --> 01:12:03,234
- I think you could use some rest too.
- I suppose we all could.

660
01:12:03,435 --> 01:12:06,905
- Why don't you go and lie down?
- I'd rather not, not now.

661
01:12:07,395 --> 01:12:08,828
- David?
- Hm?

662
01:12:09,115 --> 01:12:11,310
Do you really think
we'll get out of this?

663
01:12:12,315 --> 01:12:16,308
Well, I think we stand
a very good chance, yes.

664
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:18,831
But you don't believe that, do you?

665
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:24,263
Not 100%, no,
but I'd like to believe it.

666
01:12:24,475 --> 01:12:25,669
Toni?

667
01:12:27,995 --> 01:12:31,067
I've never been...
I've never been much good at...

668
01:12:31,795 --> 01:12:34,593
At being serious with a woman
before now, but...

669
01:12:34,795 --> 01:12:36,786
If we get out of this, I will...

670
01:12:38,635 --> 01:12:42,230
Don't say anything more.
Not here, not now.

671
01:12:44,475 --> 01:12:46,705
Yes, I'd better get outside,
it's nearly midnight.

672
01:12:46,915 --> 01:12:49,509
David, be careful,

673
01:12:50,515 --> 01:12:51,994
I love you.

674
01:13:11,875 --> 01:13:13,786
The cattle are getting restless.

675
01:13:15,835 --> 01:13:18,303
Aye, they're moving around a lot.

676
01:13:21,395 --> 01:13:25,149
- How are the people taking things?
- I think it'll be all right.

677
01:13:25,355 --> 01:13:28,472
- The boys are keeping the talk going.
- Good.

678
01:13:36,515 --> 01:13:38,107
How many, do you think?

679
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:40,712
Hard to tell. About 100.

680
01:13:41,475 --> 01:13:44,547
- So they didn't divide.
- It doesn't look like it.

681
01:13:49,915 --> 01:13:51,234
Well, this is it.

682
01:13:52,115 --> 01:13:53,673
It's a nightmare.

683
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:00,224
It's all over.

684
01:14:03,115 --> 01:14:04,787
They're coming this way!

685
01:14:09,115 --> 01:14:10,946
- Not stopping.
- No.

686
01:14:11,195 --> 01:14:13,550
- Good Lord, look!
- They're dividing.

687
01:14:15,315 --> 01:14:17,624
That means the effect
of the Strontium will be halved.

688
01:14:17,835 --> 01:14:20,713
- I'd hoped it'd work before then.
- Let's get inside.

689
01:14:31,715 --> 01:14:34,149
Tell them it may take time
to work.

690
01:14:34,355 --> 01:14:36,710
- Will it work?
- I wish I knew.

691
01:14:45,275 --> 01:14:48,426
- Brian, they've divided.
- What does that mean?

692
01:14:48,635 --> 01:14:51,911
That the power and effect of
the Strontium is cut in half.

693
01:14:52,115 --> 01:14:54,868
Did they divide before
or after they ate the cattle?

694
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:56,986
- After.
- That's something.

695
01:14:57,195 --> 01:15:00,790
- Not much, but it's something.
- How's your arm?

696
01:15:00,995 --> 01:15:02,951
I'm trying not to think about it.

697
01:15:03,155 --> 01:15:05,669
It may take time
for the Strontium to work.

698
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:07,149
If it works.

699
01:15:18,835 --> 01:15:21,224
- I don't like this.
- The generator's had it.

700
01:15:21,435 --> 01:15:23,391
- They're coming.
- I can hear.

701
01:15:23,635 --> 01:15:25,114
I'd better talk to them.

702
01:15:26,915 --> 01:15:28,394
- Quiet everyone!
- Hold it!

703
01:15:28,595 --> 01:15:31,063
- Please try and be quiet!
- Now don't panic.

704
01:15:31,275 --> 01:15:34,426
We expected them here.
We must give it time to work.

705
01:15:39,075 --> 01:15:40,986
Light the candles and lanterns.

706
01:15:44,035 --> 01:15:45,946
Take it easy! Take it easy!

707
01:15:46,195 --> 01:15:48,072
Quiet, please. Quiet.

708
01:15:48,715 --> 01:15:50,945
They're frightened without the light.

709
01:15:51,155 --> 01:15:52,793
- If they start breaking out.
- I know.

710
01:15:52,995 --> 01:15:54,986
Come on, we've got a job to do.

711
01:15:58,515 --> 01:16:00,551
- What's happened to the lights?
- Quiet!

712
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:03,111
Be careful,
they're panicking as it is.

713
01:16:03,315 --> 01:16:05,954
- I'm sorry.
- We've got to set an example.

714
01:16:17,235 --> 01:16:18,554
I'm not staying here.

715
01:16:23,395 --> 01:16:25,590
I'll shoot anyone that moves,
I mean it.

716
01:16:26,155 --> 01:16:27,588
I'll shoot anyone that moves.

717
01:16:28,195 --> 01:16:31,585
Get back to your places,
away from the windows and the door.

718
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:41,748
Look out!

719
01:17:04,635 --> 01:17:06,944
Get to the clinic,
as many as you can!

720
01:17:11,075 --> 01:17:12,827
Open the door!

721
01:17:14,355 --> 01:17:17,028
They're breaking in.
Take care of her, I'll be back.

722
01:17:17,235 --> 01:17:18,190
Wait!

723
01:17:21,235 --> 01:17:23,430
Come on,
quickly, block it!

724
01:17:23,635 --> 01:17:25,546
Quick, bring anything you can!

725
01:17:25,755 --> 01:17:27,791
Quickly, bring it over here!

726
01:17:28,555 --> 01:17:32,184
- Hold on.
- I'm trying, but I'm so frightened.

727
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:34,430
I'm frightened.

728
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:52,587
No place else to go.

729
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,392
Hold it,
they're getting weaker.

730
01:19:20,675 --> 01:19:21,949
Careful.

731
01:19:30,795 --> 01:19:32,592
Give me a hand with this.

732
01:20:17,395 --> 01:20:18,430
They're dead.

733
01:20:19,715 --> 01:20:22,787
- Oh, David!
- Darling, it's all over.

734
01:20:22,995 --> 01:20:24,587
We're all right now.

735
01:20:25,715 --> 01:20:29,105
- And now my hand itches.
- Oh, shut up, Brian.

736
01:20:29,555 --> 01:20:32,228
Watch it, or I'll sue you
for malpractice.

737
01:20:39,395 --> 01:20:41,989
As soon as we get on,
we'll radio ahead for aid.

738
01:20:42,195 --> 01:20:44,755
We'll need a lot of help to clean up
the island, bury the dead.

739
01:20:44,955 --> 01:20:47,071
They'll send everything,
this afternoon.

740
01:20:47,635 --> 01:20:49,705
I wish Philips'
had never started this.

741
01:20:49,915 --> 01:20:52,383
No, he was just trying
to help humanity.

742
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:56,713
Science has its risks, but they
aren't enough to hinder progress.

743
01:20:57,275 --> 01:21:00,711
- Have you searched the island?
- Yes, several times.

744
01:21:00,915 --> 01:21:02,428
We killed them all, I'm certain.

745
01:21:32,995 --> 01:21:34,826
I shudder to think of them.

746
01:21:35,035 --> 01:21:37,833
Don't think about them, just try
to get them out of your mind.

747
01:21:38,035 --> 01:21:40,230
- It's easier said than done.
- I know.

748
01:21:40,715 --> 01:21:44,105
- What'll happen to the villagers?
- We'll send back help.

749
01:21:44,915 --> 01:21:47,031
You know, we were lucky
this is an island.

750
01:21:47,515 --> 01:21:51,394
If it had happened anywhere else,
I doubt we would've destroyed them.
