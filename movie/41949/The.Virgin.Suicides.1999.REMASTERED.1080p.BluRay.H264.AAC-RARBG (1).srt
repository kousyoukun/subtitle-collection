1
00:01:19,664 --> 00:01:21,583
<i>Cecilia was the first to go.</i>

2
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:06,961
What are you doing here, honey?

3
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,923
You're not even old enough
to know how bad life gets.

4
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:14,385
Obviously, Doctor,
you've never been a 13-year-old girl.

5
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:52,465
<i>Everyone dates
the demise of our neighborhood</i>

6
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:55,009
<i>from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.</i>

7
00:02:56,094 --> 00:02:59,013
<i>People saw their clairvoyance
in the wiped-out elms,</i>

8
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:00,598
<i>the harsh sunlight,</i>

9
00:03:00,682 --> 00:03:03,268
<i>and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.</i>

10
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:07,480
<i>Even then, as teenagers,
we tried to put the pieces together.</i>

11
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,400
<i>We still can't.</i>

12
00:03:10,483 --> 00:03:14,195
<i>Now, whenever we run into each other
at business lunches or cocktail parties,</i>

13
00:03:14,279 --> 00:03:17,657
<i>we find ourselves in the corner
going over the evidence one more time.</i>

14
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:20,952
<i>All to understand those five girls...</i>

15
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,789
<i>who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.</i>

16
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,128
<i>Cecilia, the youngest, was 13.</i>

17
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:35,174
<i>And Lux was 14.</i>

18
00:03:37,677 --> 00:03:40,054
<i>Bonnie was 15.</i>

19
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:42,056
<i>Mary was 16.</i>

20
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,937
<i>And Therese was 17.</i>

21
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:54,277
<i>No one could understand how Mrs. Lisbon
and Mr. Lisbon, our math teacher,</i>

22
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,738
<i>had produced such beautiful creatures.</i>

23
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:04,287
<i>Paul Baldino claimed to have found Cecilia
on her first attempt.</i>

24
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,456
Hey, I was the one who found her.

25
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:09,375
I was in the storm sewer
under my house,

26
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:11,127
and there's all these tunnels.

27
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,254
You can get into anyone's house.

28
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:15,590
<i>So when Paul said this, we believed him</i>

29
00:04:15,673 --> 00:04:18,301
<i>because he was the son
of Sammy "The Shark" Baldino,</i>

30
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:21,054
<i>and we knew about his escape tunnel
that led through the sewers.</i>

31
00:04:21,137 --> 00:04:24,724
So I went up, thinkin' I could see
one of those Lisbon girls takin' a shower.

32
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:26,434
- Yeah.
- All right.

33
00:04:26,517 --> 00:04:27,727
And I walk in...

34
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,188
and I see blood everywhere.

35
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:34,609
So I turned around and went straight
for the stairs and right back up the tunnel.

36
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:37,904
Had to tell you guys that story, so...

37
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,989
I'll see you guys later, all right?

38
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:44,827
<i>I heard it was an accident.</i>

39
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,998
No, it was no accident, Joan.
Of course the parents are to blame.

40
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:52,585
Well, I heard they found
the razor in the toilet.

41
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,089
<i>Everyone had an opinion
as to why Cecilia had tried to kill herself.</i>

42
00:04:56,172 --> 00:04:58,091
That girl didn't wanna die.

43
00:04:58,174 --> 00:05:00,343
She just wanted out of that house.

44
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,845
She wanted out of that decorating scheme.

45
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:10,353
<i>The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.</i>

46
00:05:11,312 --> 00:05:13,815
<i>Dominic was the immigrant kid
who was staying with relatives</i>

47
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,776
<i>until his family
got settled in New Mexico.</i>

48
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:19,404
<i>He was the first boy in our neighborhood
to wear sunglasses,</i>

49
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,532
<i>and within a week of his arrival
he'd fallen in love.</i>

50
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:27,662
<i>The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.</i>

51
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:34,502
I love her.

52
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,839
<i>When Diana Porter
left on vacation in Switzerland,</i>

53
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,841
<i>Dominic denounced God.</i>

54
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,092
I don't know!

55
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:46,180
<i>And to prove the validity of his love,
he jumped off the roof of his relatives' house.</i>

56
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:11,247
I'm gonna show you some images.

57
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,834
And, uh, you tell me...

58
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:18,838
what they remind you of.

59
00:06:20,381 --> 00:06:22,050
Okay?

60
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,234
A banana.

61
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,909
A swamp.

62
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,295
An Afro.

63
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,261
Mm-hmm.

64
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:21,067
I don't think Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

65
00:07:22,735 --> 00:07:25,196
Her act was a cry for help.

66
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,949
I know you're very strict,

67
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:30,701
but I think that Cecilia would benefit

68
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:35,873
by having a social outlet
outside of the codification of school...

69
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,419
where she could interact
with males her own age.

70
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:50,054
<i>Peter Sisten had helped Mr. Lisbon</i>

71
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,266
<i>install a model of the solar system
in his classroom,</i>

72
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:56,477
<i>and in return Mr. Lisbon
invited him for dinner.</i>

73
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:58,479
Bless us, O Lord, in these, thy gifts

74
00:07:58,563 --> 00:08:00,898
which we are about to receive
from thy bounty.

75
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:03,025
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

76
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,944
Amen.

77
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,530
Lux, please.
Put your shirt on this instant.

78
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:09,282
Sorry.

79
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,412
Thank you, dear.

80
00:08:14,495 --> 00:08:16,414
Can you pass the salt, please?

81
00:08:16,497 --> 00:08:18,708
- Ham?
- Thank you.

82
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:21,502
Uh, sweetheart,
would you like some peas?

83
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:23,629
- I hate peas.
- Here.

84
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,674
That's a nice-looking ham, dear.

85
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:30,511
Oh, thank you, honey.

86
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:32,305
Mmm, this is good, Mom.

87
00:08:32,388 --> 00:08:35,099
So, Peter, are you,
uh, an aviation enthusiast?

88
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:36,976
Well, I, uh —

89
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:40,521
I don't know if I'd call myself
an enthusiast, but, uh, I like planes.

90
00:08:40,605 --> 00:08:42,023
- Oh, yeah?
- Thanks.

91
00:08:42,106 --> 00:08:44,317
Ah.

92
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,070
Uh, Peter, are you on —
on the football squad?

93
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:51,616
Um, no, I play it,
but I'm not actually on the team.

94
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:54,368
- Oh, I see.
- Not a team player.

95
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:56,996
Do you like to wrestle?

96
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:00,374
You okay, Peter?

97
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,545
The Brazilian turbot frog was added
to the endangered species list today.

98
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:08,507
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear.

99
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:11,219
The turbot frog.
Darling, I don't think I've ever heard of it.

100
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:13,846
Um, excuse me.
May I use the restroom?

101
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:16,933
Oh, of course.
The one down here isn't working very well.

102
00:09:17,016 --> 00:09:18,935
Go upstairs, through Cecilia's room.

103
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:20,603
Okay. Thanks.

104
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:30,756
Hold — Hold on.

105
00:10:31,549 --> 00:10:33,968
I thought you'd died in there.

106
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:38,097
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
I need something.

107
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:48,274
Do you mind?

108
00:10:56,449 --> 00:10:57,825
Thank you very much.

109
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,827
Are you forgetting something?

110
00:11:02,163 --> 00:11:04,790
Oh, Peter. Here's a little airfoil
I thought you might find —

111
00:11:04,874 --> 00:11:06,250
- Thank you.
- find amusing.

112
00:11:06,334 --> 00:11:08,210
It's a —

113
00:11:08,294 --> 00:11:10,171
demonstration of Bernoulli's principle.

114
00:11:10,254 --> 00:11:12,923
Lift and —

115
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,636
<i>From that time on,
the Lisbon house began to change.</i>

116
00:11:21,557 --> 00:11:23,809
<i>Almost every day,</i>

117
00:11:23,893 --> 00:11:26,812
<i>and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,</i>

118
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,314
<i>Lux would suntan on her towel,</i>

119
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:31,150
<i>wearing a swimsuit
that caused the knife sharpener</i>

120
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,028
<i>to give her
a 15-minute demonstration for free.</i>

121
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,575
<i>Following the doctor's orders,</i>

122
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,952
<i>two weeks after Cecilia returned home,</i>

123
00:11:42,036 --> 00:11:44,538
<i>Mr. Lisbon persuaded his wife
to allow the girls</i>

124
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:49,085
<i>to throw the first and only party
of their short lives.</i>

125
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,762
There. Is that okay?

126
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,724
I gotta get dressed.

127
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,569
- Welcome.
- Good evening, Mrs. Lisbon.

128
00:12:15,653 --> 00:12:16,987
Come on in.

129
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,535
The party's in the basement.

130
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:29,542
Just go on around to the left
and then down the stairs.

131
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,640
Hi. I'm Bonaventure.

132
00:12:44,723 --> 00:12:45,975
- Hi.
- Hi. Tim.

133
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:47,685
Nice to meet you.

134
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:50,354
- Hi.
- Hi.

135
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:55,317
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

136
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,236
- Okay.
- Thanks.

137
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,696
- Hi.
- Hi.

138
00:13:00,156 --> 00:13:01,574
Thanks.

139
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,535
- Hi.
- Thank you.

140
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,623
- Hey.
- Hi.

141
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,667
Do you wanna sit down?

142
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,918

Okay.

155
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,300
Good.

156
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,720
Do you know
where you're applying yet?

157
00:14:05,554 --> 00:14:09,058
Well, no, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale

158
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:11,185
because that's where my dad went.

159
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:14,021
That's nice.

160
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:20,128
But you have to imagine what it'd be like
when the clouds would open up

161
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:24,156
and out of the sun would come the Hun
and his Messerschmitt coming down.

162
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,867
And, boys, I swear, what,
two or three years older than you

163
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:29,370
would be in this, the P-51B Mustang.

164
00:14:29,453 --> 00:14:30,913
"B" for what?
For bull's-eye, see?

165
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:35,376
You've heard of Yale?

166
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,669
Oh, yeah.

167
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,464
This punch is fantastic.

168
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:42,550
- Can I give you more?
- Sure.

169
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,426
What's in it?

170
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,972
Juices — some cherry, uh, pineapple.

171
00:14:48,055 --> 00:14:50,182
You know, I, uh —

172
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:52,101
I love pineapple.

173
00:14:53,561 --> 00:14:55,062

This baby would come in —

177
00:15:05,573 --> 00:15:08,576
And this won the war
for the United Kingdom. You see?

178
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:12,913
- E-Excuse me.
- Sure. Okay.

179
00:15:12,997 --> 00:15:15,958
And it's this kind of, uh —
this kind of, uh, equipment that —

180
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:19,920
that makes, uh, a model work.

181
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,881
Here's Joe.

182
00:15:25,217 --> 00:15:26,218
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:27,511
Hi, Joe.

184
00:15:29,805 --> 00:15:34,310
- Now, if he needs anything, just call me.
- Oh, I'm sure we'll be fine.

185
00:15:35,019 --> 00:15:37,563
Hi.

186
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,565
Hi.

187
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,318
- Joe, good to see you.
- How are ya?

188
00:15:42,401 --> 00:15:44,069
- Good.
- Glad you came tonight.

189
00:15:44,153 --> 00:15:46,238
- How's it going?
- Hey, Joe, how's it going?

190
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:47,990
- You're just in time.
- In time.

191
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,867
Good. Hi.

192
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,995
Hey, everyone, look.
His ears wiggle if you scratch his chin.

193
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:56,832
Joe, sing your song.

194
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:00,085

00:16:09,428 --> 00:16:12,431
Good job, Joe. Good song.

199
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:14,391
Good job, Joe.

200
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:19,813
- Where'd you learn that song?
- That was good.

201
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,817
May I be excused?

202
00:16:23,901 --> 00:16:27,529
If you want to, my dear,
but this is your party.

203
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:32,660
A-All right, i-if you wanna go upstairs,
go ahead.

204
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:36,455
But we'll just — we'll just
have to have fun without you.

205
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,918
Oh, look. He always chooses heads.

206
00:16:41,001 --> 00:16:42,795
- Joe, what's it gonna be?
- Heads.

207
00:16:42,878 --> 00:16:44,296
Joe, will you try tails?

208
00:16:46,674 --> 00:16:48,509
Heads it is.

209
00:16:48,592 --> 00:16:50,344
Let's try again, eh? Let's go.

210
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:52,513
- Heads.
- Tails.

211
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:53,847
Heads.

212
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:56,767
- One more time. In the air, Joe.
- Heads.

213
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:01,605
Heads it is anyway!

214
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:02,856
One more time, man.

215
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,733
- Okay, call it in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

216
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:08,654
<i>- ♪ All I need is the air that I breathe ♪</i>
- Heads. That's enough of that.

00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:14,827
Good.

220
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,578
- Picked it up pretty well.
- Yeah.

221
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:18,789
- You should have a record.
- It's my favorite song.

222
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:22,000
You know, you're very beautiful.

223
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,087
Say, I could paint you some time.

224
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,590
Thanks.

- Yeah.

227
00:17:36,348 --> 00:17:39,476
Wow, that's good.

228
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,103
Cecilia!

229
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,065
Oh, no.

Oh, my —

232
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:09,047
No! No, no, no.
Don't look. Turn around.

233
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:13,385
Turn around. Darlings, turn around.

234
00:18:13,469 --> 00:18:15,179
Don't look. Don't — Don't loo —

235
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:16,930
What is this?

236
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,558
Oh, Jesus. Please, God.

237
00:19:09,817 --> 00:19:11,819
What do we have here now?

238
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:14,488
No funerals today.

239
00:19:20,911 --> 00:19:22,329
You in charge?

240
00:19:34,383 --> 00:19:35,592
All right.

241
00:19:40,889 --> 00:19:42,975
- Okay.
- Okay, fellas.

242
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:57,406
Said she was only 13.

243
00:20:02,035 --> 00:20:05,038
<i>Against Kinella lifetime, 12 out of 47.</i>

244

<i>He has a home run

245

<i>Kinella looks in,

246
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,922
Oh, hi, Mary.
Are your parents home?

247
00:20:14,006 --> 00:20:16,300
Hi, Father Moody. Come in.

248
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:18,635
<i>Taken up high. Ball one.</i>

249
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:26,059
Oh, hello, Father.

250
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:29,855
- Please sit down.
<i>- Inside. Ball two.</i>

251
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,398
Thanks.

252
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,651
Come on, Miller, that was inside.

253
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:38,572
Uh, no. No, thanks.

254
00:20:41,575 --> 00:20:42,743
Ah.

255
00:20:47,164 --> 00:20:50,417
How 'bout we get the missus down here,
have a little chat?

256
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:53,295
Afraid she's under the weather.

257
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,255
She's not really...

258
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,050
uh, seeing anybody.

259
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:02,721
Well, she'll see her priest.

260
00:21:03,555 --> 00:21:07,142
Ah, this kid's a sucker
for the high inside ones every time.

261
00:21:07,225 --> 00:21:09,853
<i>- Swing and a miss. Strike two.</i>
- Every time.

262
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:12,731
Excuse me.

263
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:16,526
Father.

264
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:19,154
<i>Swing and a ground ball to short!</i>

265
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:22,282
<i>Walker picks it up, makes a flip to Durand,
over to Burnett!</i>

266
00:21:22,366 --> 00:21:24,034
<i>Double play!</i>

267
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,954
- Double play, Father.
<i>- And that will end the inning.</i>

268
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:29,581
Double play.

269
00:21:35,212 --> 00:21:37,339
<i>He's hitting .212 this season,</i>

270
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:41,927
<i>has 23 home runs,

271
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:44,846
<i>He steps up against Kinella.</i>

272
00:21:45,973 --> 00:21:49,810
<i>Rosenthal against Kinella lifetime,

273

274
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:55,565
- Mrs. Lisbon?
<i>- He now looks in, shakes off the sign.</i>

275
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,492
May I come in?

276
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,827
Okay.

277
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,456
Hello, girls.

278
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,168
I thought we could talk.

279
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,796
Do you feel like talking?

280
00:22:19,381 --> 00:22:23,176
Well, if you ever want to,
you know where to find me.

281
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:35,272
Mrs. Lisbon, it's Father Moody.

282
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,572
Mrs. Lisbon, hello.

283
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:52,831
I wanted you to know that I listed
Cecilia's death as an accident.

284
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,097
An accident waiting to happen.

285
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:11,558
John said you couldn't
get a policy to cover it.

286
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,643
I know. It's so incredibly dangerous.

287
00:23:13,727 --> 00:23:15,228
Let's give it a try.

288
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:20,609
Ready?

289
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:22,444
One, two, three.

290
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,116
Oh, God.

291
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,495
- It's just so sad, I can't even believe it.
- Footings are too deep.

292
00:23:32,871 --> 00:23:34,581
You got that chain in your truck?

293
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:55,560
Hit it!

294
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:15,163
<i>Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls, which still exists,</i>

295
00:24:15,247 --> 00:24:18,125
<i>started with Cecilia's diary.</i>

296
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,253
<i>Parkie had gotten it from Skip Ortega,
the plumber's assistant,</i>

297
00:24:21,336 --> 00:24:23,713
<i>who had found it
next to the toilet in the bathroom.</i>

298
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:26,550
<i>Tim Weiner, the brain, decoded it.</i>

299
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,802
Emotional instability.

300
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,097
Look at the I's, the dots on 'em.
They're everywhere.

301
00:24:34,057 --> 00:24:37,936
Basically, what we have here
is a dreamer,

302
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,480
someone completely out of touch
with reality.

303
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:43,024
When she jumped,
she probably thought she was flying.

304
00:24:43,108 --> 00:24:44,609
Here.

305
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:50,282
"Monday, February 13.
Today we had frozen pizza.

306
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,413
Thursday. Mom made
creamed corn for dinner.

307
00:24:56,496 --> 00:24:58,331
It's the worst. It looks like —"

308
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:04,379
"Mary chipped her front tooth
on the monkey bars, acting like an idiot.

309
00:25:04,462 --> 00:25:08,049
She made a big scene and had to go get
her tooth capped. It looks normal, I guess."

310
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,759
Here, give me that.

311
00:25:10,844 --> 00:25:13,138
I told you she had a capped tooth.

312
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:22,564
Elm trees. How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

313
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,109
Here. Something about Dominic.

314
00:25:28,403 --> 00:25:32,240
"Palazzolo jumped off the roof today
over that rich bitch Porter.

315
00:25:32,324 --> 00:25:33,783
How stupid can you be?"

316
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:39,247
"Today we went out on the boat.
It was pretty cold.

317
00:25:39,331 --> 00:25:41,499
We saw a couple of whales.

318
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:44,437
Lux leaned over and stroked a whale.
I didn't think they would stink so much.

319
00:25:44,461 --> 00:25:47,172
It's the kelp in their baleens rotting.

320
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,591
I hope we can go again sometime."

321
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,468
Hang on. Just read this. Read that.

322
00:25:51,551 --> 00:25:53,553
- "Lux lost it over Kevin..."
- "Hines."

323
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,264
- Is it "Hines"? The garbage man.
- The garbage man.

324
00:25:56,348 --> 00:25:59,851
<i>Lux lost it over Kevin Heines,
the garbage man.</i>

325
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:03,730
<i>She'd wake up at 5:00 in the morning
and hang out casually on the front steps,</i>

326
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:05,857
<i>like it wasn't completely obvious.</i>

327
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,985
<i>She wrote his name in marker
on all her bras and underwear.</i>

328
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,529
<i>Mom found them
and bleached out all the Kevins.</i>

329
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:13,990
<i>Lux was crying on her bed all day.</i>

330
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:26,086
<i>The trees, like lungs filling with air.</i>

331
00:26:26,169 --> 00:26:29,422
<i>My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair.</i>

332
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:37,347
<i>And so we started
to learn about their lives...</i>

333
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:42,811
<i>coming to hold collective memories
of times we hadn't experienced.</i>

334
00:26:42,894 --> 00:26:45,730
<i>We felt the imprisonment of being a girl,</i>

335
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:49,025
<i>the way it made your mind
active and dreamy</i>

336
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:52,696
<i>and how you ended up knowing
what colors went together.</i>

337
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,365
<i>We knew that the girls
were really women in disguise,</i>

338
00:26:55,448 --> 00:26:58,285
<i>that they understood love
and even death,</i>

339
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:02,372
<i>and that our job was merely to create
the noise that seemed to fascinate them.</i>

340
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:07,127
<i>We knew that they knew
everything about us</i>

341
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:09,546
<i>and that we couldn't fathom them at all.</i>

342
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:25,603

344
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:28,773
Oh.

345
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,984
Hi, I'm Bonnie. This is Mary.

346
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,652
Hello, girls.

347
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,491
Um, I'm here to ask you a couple
of questions, uh, about Cecilia.

348
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:41,286
Yeah?

349
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,912
Oh, great, great.

350
00:27:42,996 --> 00:27:47,292
Um, maybe you could start by,
um, telling me a little bit about her.

351
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:52,047
Um, did she have
any special interests or hobbies?

352
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,550
Um, she liked to write
in her journal a lot.

353
00:27:55,633 --> 00:27:57,260
That is great.

354
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:59,012
Um, okay.

355
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:03,266
Uh, did she — did she ever talk
about ending her life?

356
00:28:03,892 --> 00:28:05,894
What's going on here?

357
00:28:05,977 --> 00:28:08,355
Um, you must be Mrs. Lisbon.

358
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:11,316
I'm Lydia Perl.
I'm doing a piece for Channel 2 and —

359
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:13,401
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

360
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,156
<i>The suicide of an east-side teenager
last summer</i>

361
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:21,368
<i>has increased the awareness
of a national crisis.</i>

362
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,621
<i>I now stand in front of the home
where Cecilia Lisbon, a 13-year-old...</i>

363
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,414
Why don't they just let her
rest in peace?

364
00:28:26,498 --> 00:28:28,208
<i>...who liked to paint and write poetry,</i>

365
00:28:28,291 --> 00:28:30,251
<i>tragically put an end to her life.</i>

366
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,754
<i>Psychologists agree
that adolescence today</i>

367
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:37,592
<i>is much more fraught by pressures
and complexities than in years past.</i>

368
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:41,846
<i>More and more doctors say that
this frustration can lead to acts of violence</i>

369
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:46,810
<i>whose reality the adolescent
cannot separate from its intended drama.</i>

370
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,605
<i>I baked a pie
full of rat poison.</i>

371
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:54,025
<i>I thought I could eat it,
you know,</i>

372
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,985
<i>without being suspicious.</i>

373
00:28:58,196 --> 00:29:00,740
<i>My nana, who was 86...</i>

374
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:06,329
<i>She really liked sweets.</i>

375
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,333
<i>She had three pieces.</i>

376
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,925
<i>I feel sorriest for the mother.</i>

377
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,343
<i>I know.</i>

378
00:29:20,427 --> 00:29:22,863
<i>You would always wonder if there
was something you could've done.</i>

379
00:29:22,887 --> 00:29:25,473
<i>- Well, I gotta go. See you later.
- All right, then.</i>

380
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,142
<i>- Bye-bye.
- Bye.</i>

381
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,581
Don't worry.

382
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:34,501
They took the fence out.

383
00:30:55,605 --> 00:30:57,357
God, you snore loud.

384
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,613
Those girls have
a bright future ahead of them.

385
00:31:46,406 --> 00:31:49,117
The other one
was just gonna end up a kook.

386
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,496
<i>We didn't see the girls together
as a group until convocation, September 7.</i>

387
00:31:54,581 --> 00:31:58,376
<i>Mary, Lux, Bonnie, and Therese</i>

388
00:31:58,459 --> 00:32:00,920
<i>came to school
as though nothing had happened.</i>

389
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,922
<i>And we felt that
if we kept looking hard enough,</i>

390
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:07,051
<i>we might begin to understand
what they were feeling and who they were.</i>

391
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,512
All right, so, if we have —

392
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:11,681
And these are Venn diagrams,
as you remember.

393
00:32:11,764 --> 00:32:15,602
If we have A and B intersecting,

394
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:17,604
and A and B,

395
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:21,441
if A intersects B, we have this area.

396
00:32:21,524 --> 00:32:25,695
And if A is the union with B,
we have all of the circle

397
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,196
plus the intersection.

398
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:32,535
These are the laws
of intersection and union. Okay?

399
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,089
How's it going?

400
00:32:46,841 --> 00:32:48,301
Not bad.

401
00:32:52,305 --> 00:32:56,934
Okay, do a character sketch on
the following characters from <i>Portrait of a Lady.</i>

402
00:32:57,018 --> 00:32:59,854
The first one is... Ralph.

403
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:03,107
Um... he was nice.

404
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:05,485
It was really sad when he died.

405
00:33:08,154 --> 00:33:10,948
Oh, my gosh.
I can't believe I just said that.

406
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,034
I am so sorry.

407
00:33:25,254 --> 00:33:28,466
Reading about
the alarming suicide rate,

408
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:32,011
I talked to Mr. Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here

409
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:35,848
and realized that nothing
about this serious matter

410
00:33:35,932 --> 00:33:38,434
has been discussed at this school.

411
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,813
<i>And quickly thereafter,
green pamphlets were distributed.</i>

412
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:45,817
<i>We thought green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.</i>

413
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,944
<i>Certainly better than red.</i>

414
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,615
<i>The green pamphlets told us
that there were 80 suicides a day in America,</i>

415
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:54,075
<i>30,000 a year...</i>

416
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,493
Cheese!

417
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:58,204
<i>...and alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.</i>

418
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:01,040
<i>Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?</i>

419
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,628
<i>Had they lost interest in school activities,
in sports and hobbies?</i>

420
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:08,172
<i>Had they withdrawn from their peers?</i>

421
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,051
Hi. I'm Chase.

422
00:34:14,345 --> 00:34:16,347
I know who you are.

423
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:20,435
I've only been going to this school
my whole life.

424
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:23,563
You don't have to talk to me.

425
00:34:33,364 --> 00:34:36,492
So, for example, we have
two different types of economics,

426
00:34:36,576 --> 00:34:38,786
or so-called two different types
of economics.

427
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:43,541
Now, the first one, we would say,
is called macroeconomics, which is...

428
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,127
Look. She's laughing.

429
00:34:48,212 --> 00:34:50,131
He made her laugh.

430
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,967
I never heard him
say anything remotely intelligent.

431
00:34:54,677 --> 00:34:57,555
<i>The boys who talked with Lux
were always the stupidest boys</i>

432
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,391
<i>and made terrible sources of information.</i>

433
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:03,102
Squeezebox. She's all right.

434
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:06,439
Let me tell you,
she's the hottest girl in the school, for sure.

435
00:35:07,148 --> 00:35:10,401
You wanna know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

436
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:13,154
Nah, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

437
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:15,865
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what I mean.

438
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,661
<i>But the only reliable boy
who actually got to know Lux...</i>

439
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:23,372
<i>was Trip Fontaine,</i>

440
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,877
<i>who, only eight months before the suicides,
had emerged from baby fat</i>

441
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,214
<i>to the delight of girls and mothers alike.</i>

442
00:35:32,215 --> 00:35:33,841
I'm late again.

443
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:37,762
Oh, come on.

00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:49,357

466
00:37:14,525 --> 00:37:17,445
<i>As was his custom, he went out
to his car to smoke the marijuana</i>

467
00:37:17,528 --> 00:37:22,325
<i>he took as regularly as Peter Petrovich,

he ran into Mr. Woodhouse in the hall</i>

469
00:37:31,417 --> 00:37:33,753
<i>and ducked into the nearest class.</i>

470
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:50,770
<i>She was the still point

471

I never got over that girl.

00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:55,942
Never.

473
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:01,405
I mean, you know, I loved a lot of ladies,
but not like that.

474
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,115
That was real.

475

477
00:38:09,288 --> 00:38:10,915
I-I didn't know what to do.

478
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,835
It was so easy with all the other girls.

479
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:17,254
But she wouldn't look at me.

480
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,256
I, uh —

481
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,843
I was never the kind to pursue,
if you know what I mean.

482
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:29,058
That girl drove me crazy, man.

483
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,450
- Mmm, yummy. Warm.
- Mm-hmm.

484
00:38:46,534 --> 00:38:48,619
Hey, Lux.

485
00:38:48,703 --> 00:38:50,121
Hey.

486
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,085
Look at him.

487
00:38:56,168 --> 00:38:58,879

- Ew. Sick.

<i>Likewise, the low pressure area slides
down the sides of the high pressure area.</i>

512
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:39,605
<i>They swirl in and around one another,
creating the beginnings of the storm.</i>

513
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:46,403
<i>In this footage,
taken from US Navy weather patrol aircraft,</i>

514
00:40:46,487 --> 00:40:49,156
<i>we can clearly observe the two masses —</i>

515
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,826
<i>one high pressure and one low pressure —</i>

516
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,328
<i>coming in contact with one another.</i>

517
00:40:57,414 --> 00:41:00,543
<i>The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength</i>

518
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03,295
<i>that strikes with forceful determination.</i>

519
00:41:10,386 --> 00:41:13,722
<i>Even though the hurricane is the
most powerful storm known to all of us —</i>

520
00:41:15,516 --> 00:41:19,061
<i>as it strikes large land areas,
such as continents or large islands,</i>

521
00:41:19,145 --> 00:41:21,063
<i>it slowly dies.</i>

522
00:41:21,147 --> 00:41:22,565
That must've been Conley.

523
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:25,234
His ass is grass.

524
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,117
I'm gonna ask you out.

525
00:41:35,369 --> 00:41:36,871
Fat chance.

526
00:41:40,583 --> 00:41:44,336
First I'm gonna come over to your house
on Sunday and watch the tube.

527
00:41:45,379 --> 00:41:47,464
Then I'm gonna ask you out.

528
00:41:47,548 --> 00:41:50,551
<i>...resulting in few injuries

529
00:41:50,634 --> 00:41:53,262

530
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:55,347

531
00:41:56,307 --> 00:41:59,101
You're a stone fox.

532
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:02,563
<i>The hurricane,
one of the most truly awe-inspiring</i>

533
00:42:02,646 --> 00:42:05,065
<i>and spectacular storms
nature has to offer.</i>

534
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:14,783
What channel is this?

535
00:42:14,867 --> 00:42:17,328
- Five.
- Ah, let's see.

536
00:42:17,411 --> 00:42:20,664
Um, "Animals in the wild.

537
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:23,459

in their natural habitat."

539
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:29,131
I think that sounds very nice, don't you?

540
00:42:29,215 --> 00:42:31,592
<i>Now to the southwest,</i>

541
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:34,345
<i>this huge rain forest

542
00:42:34,428 --> 00:42:36,138
<i>to expansive, arid grasslands</i>

543
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:39,308
<i>that stretch to the horizon
in all directions.</i>

544
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:42,269
<i>This is the Kalahari.</i>

545
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:44,355
Uh, do you want some more pop?

546
00:42:45,522 --> 00:42:47,024
Yeah, sure. Thank you.

547
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:54,365
Thanks.

548
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:03,082
<i>The wildlife spectacle played out

549
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:05,918
<i>and in the deep recesses of the rain forest</i>

550
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:08,337

551
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:19,390
Lux, please put your feet down, honey.

552
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:27,690
<i>The Kalahari and its vast, open skies</i>

553
00:43:27,773 --> 00:43:30,651

556
00:43:37,157 --> 00:43:39,243
Oh, my.

557
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:42,288
I-I-It's getting so late. Honey?

558
00:43:45,916 --> 00:43:47,394
- Yeah. Oh!
- I said it's getting late.

559
00:43:47,418 --> 00:43:51,005
Well, uh, Skip, we usually,
uh, hit the hay about now, so...

560
00:43:52,881 --> 00:43:54,633
Right. Yeah.

561
00:43:59,763 --> 00:44:01,390
- Okay. Okay.
- Thank you.

562
00:44:01,473 --> 00:44:03,892
- Okay, so...
- It was nice to meet you, Mrs. Lisbon.

563
00:44:03,976 --> 00:44:06,145
- Yes.
- Thank you.

564
00:44:06,228 --> 00:44:08,230
- Good night.
- See ya.

565
00:44:08,314 --> 00:44:10,441
Yeah.

I don't have you until fifth, do I?

577
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,945
- Uh, no.
- Oh.

578
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:22,114
I'm not here for math today, sir.

579
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,204
Look, I'm here to tell you that my intentions
for your daughter are entirely honorable.

580
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:34,251
What might those intentions be?

581
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:37,713
I wanna ask Lux
to the homecoming dance.

582
00:46:40,757 --> 00:46:43,469
Trip, why don't you sit down for a minute.

583
00:46:43,552 --> 00:46:44,970
All right.

584
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,184
You see, my wife and I have certain rules.

585
00:46:51,143 --> 00:46:53,061
They've been the same rules
for the older girls,

586
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:56,106
and I can't very well go and change them now
for the younger ones.

587
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:59,776
Even if I wanted to, the wife wouldn't let me.
It's true.

588
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,156
So, uh, if you wanna come over
and watch television again,

589
00:47:04,239 --> 00:47:05,741
that would be fine.

590
00:47:05,824 --> 00:47:09,786
But you cannot take Lux out,
especially not in a car.

591
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:12,706
So, I'm sorry, son.
That's just our policy.

592
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:19,755
Okay, sir, what if —
what if there was a bunch of us guys

593
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:22,382
and we took all your daughters out
in a group

594
00:47:22,466 --> 00:47:25,219
and we had 'em back
by whatever time that you said?

595
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:27,137
You on the football squad son?

596
00:47:28,138 --> 00:47:30,516
- Yes, sir.
- Oh. What position?

597
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:31,892
Defensive corner back.

598
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:34,353
Ah. Well, uh, good. Good.

599
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:37,523
I was a —
I was a safety in my day.

600
00:47:37,606 --> 00:47:39,942
Well, that's a crucial position, sir.

601
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:42,861
- Nothing between you and the goal line.
- Exactly. Exactly.

602
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,863
Uh, well...

603
00:47:45,572 --> 00:47:48,825
So, the thing is, sir, we've got
the big game against Country Day,

604
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:52,079
and then afterwards
we have the dance and everything, and...

605
00:47:52,162 --> 00:47:54,498
like, all the other guys
are taking dates.

606
00:47:54,581 --> 00:47:58,669
You're a good-looking fellow, Trip.
Lots of girls would go with you, I bet.

607
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:02,631
Yeah, well, I'm not interested
in lots of girls, sir.

608
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,849
I'll take it up with the wife, Trip,
do what I can.

609
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:16,103
Thank you, sir.

610
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:20,482
- It's a classic. It's really dark.
- Oh.

611
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,694
Mmm.

612
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:34,413
Uh, Trip Fontaine and, uh,
some of the other boys on the football squad

613
00:48:34,496 --> 00:48:36,957
have asked to take the girls
to the homecoming dance.

614
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,502
You know how I feel about that sort of thing.

615
00:48:40,586 --> 00:48:42,588
But, dear, I'm gonna be a chaperone
at the dance.

616
00:48:42,671 --> 00:48:45,257
Oh, come on, Mom, please.

617
00:48:46,258 --> 00:48:48,844
Your father and I will discuss it later.

618
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,141
Mr. Fontaine, may I speak with you, please?

619
00:48:54,975 --> 00:48:57,936
Now, my wife and I
have, uh, had a little talk,

620
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,397
and we've come to a decision
about your request.

621
00:49:06,361 --> 00:49:07,696
Okay?

622
00:49:14,286 --> 00:49:15,787
Yes!

623
00:49:21,376 --> 00:49:23,420
Taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

624
00:49:23,503 --> 00:49:25,505
All I need is three guys
to take the other girls.

625
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:35,307
I'll give you three joints, Trip.

626
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:37,934
Come on, Trip, man.
You pick me, we can take my dad's Caddie.

627
00:49:38,018 --> 00:49:40,520
You gotta pick me, Tripster.

628
00:49:42,272 --> 00:49:44,733
Trip, man, you owe me.

629
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:47,110
I saved your ass with Woodhouse that time.

630
00:49:47,194 --> 00:49:49,488
- Oh, thanks, Dad!
- Okay, okay, okay.

631
00:49:49,571 --> 00:49:51,073
Who are the other boys?

632
00:49:51,156 --> 00:49:54,451
Uh, let's see.
Parker Denton and Jake Conley.

633
00:49:54,534 --> 00:49:58,455
He's a very good student, dear.
And, uh, uh, Kevin Head.

634
00:49:58,538 --> 00:50:00,791
- Who's taking who?
- Whom.

635
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:02,834
They're just gonna raffle us off.

636
00:50:05,295 --> 00:50:07,923
<i>It didn't make any difference
which pattern of their dream dresses</i>

637
00:50:08,006 --> 00:50:09,633
<i>the girls each chose.</i>

638
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:13,970
<i>Mrs. Lisbon added an inch to the bust line
and two inches to the waist and hems.</i>

639
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,683
<i>And the dresses came out
as four identical sacks.</i>

640
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:20,227
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

641
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:23,522
Okay, come on.

642
00:50:26,942 --> 00:50:29,653
Oh, sorry. Okay, here we go.
Okay, come on. Together.

643
00:50:31,071 --> 00:50:33,365
- There's a leak.
- And cheddar cheese.

644
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:39,204
I'm so excited.

645
00:50:40,455 --> 00:50:41,748
You're in my way.

646
00:51:00,517 --> 00:51:02,686
- We ready?
- Let's go.

647
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:04,396
Ready, man.

648
00:51:04,479 --> 00:51:06,106
Let's do it.

649
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:13,780
<i>In the end,
Parkie won because of the Cadillac,</i>

650
00:51:13,864 --> 00:51:16,616
<i>Kevin Head because he had the killer weed,</i>

651
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,703
<i>and Joe Hill Conley because
he won all the school prizes,</i>

652
00:51:19,786 --> 00:51:22,581
<i>which Trip thought would impress
Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon.</i>

653
00:51:24,791 --> 00:51:27,294
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mrs. Lisbon.

654
00:51:28,253 --> 00:51:29,504
Come in.

655
00:51:29,588 --> 00:51:31,089
Thank you.

656
00:51:44,019 --> 00:51:45,896
Uh, who — who's driving?

657
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:47,105
I am.

658
00:51:47,189 --> 00:51:49,316
How long have you had your license?

659
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,959
Two months, but I had my learner's permit
for a year before that.

660
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:54,738
You know, we — we almost never
allow the girls to go out in cars

661
00:51:54,821 --> 00:51:56,364
unless it's necessary.

662
00:51:56,448 --> 00:52:00,368
There's so many accidents nowadays.
I'm sure you will be very careful.

663
00:52:00,452 --> 00:52:03,455
- Oh, yes, ma'am.
- Okay, third degree's over.

664
00:52:04,581 --> 00:52:06,082
Girls!

665
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,504
I better get going.
I'll see you at the dance, huh?

666
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:12,547
- See you there, Mr. Lisbon.
- Okay.

667
00:52:12,631 --> 00:52:14,966
Bye, dear.

668
00:52:15,050 --> 00:52:17,219
- See you later.
- Yeah. Good.

669
00:52:21,348 --> 00:52:23,558
Girls? Come on down.

670
00:52:24,351 --> 00:52:25,977
The boys are here.

671
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:53,004
We got white ones.

672
00:52:54,005 --> 00:52:55,674
We didn't know what you were wearing.

673
00:52:55,757 --> 00:53:00,387
The guy, the flower guy, said
that white would go with anything, so...

674
00:53:01,388 --> 00:53:03,390
I'm glad you got white.

675
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,352
Why don't you pin them on?

676
00:53:10,146 --> 00:53:11,648
Yeah.

677
00:53:12,983 --> 00:53:14,484
Here.

678
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:22,492
Don't stick me.

679
00:53:22,576 --> 00:53:25,328
Almost, almost.

680
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,208
This isn't... gonna work.

681
00:53:30,292 --> 00:53:32,335
- Just —
- Popped off right away.

682
00:53:32,419 --> 00:53:34,754
Oh.

683
00:53:34,838 --> 00:53:36,965
There we go. All right.

684
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:39,718
- Let's do it.
- All right.

685
00:53:39,801 --> 00:53:41,303
Bye, Mom.

686
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,263
Bye.

687
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:47,058
Hi.

688
00:53:52,355 --> 00:53:55,233
Oh, my gosh. Look, you guys.
Her car's there late again.

689
00:53:55,317 --> 00:53:57,861
I'm sure Mr. Leo's
having an affair with the maid.

690
00:53:57,944 --> 00:54:00,280
I saw him follow her into the laundry room.

691
00:54:00,363 --> 00:54:02,949
Ew! He's so fat, and that red nose.

692
00:54:03,033 --> 00:54:05,744
- Totally an alcoholic.
- Yeah, and what about the Hessens?

693
00:54:05,827 --> 00:54:08,997
- You know they're Nazis.
- They're Nazi sympathizers, Bonnie.

694
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:12,000
They had a fit when the Schwartzmans
tried to join the tennis club.

695
00:54:13,627 --> 00:54:15,837
Nice aluminum siding.

696
00:54:15,921 --> 00:54:17,964
Do they really think that looks okay?

697
00:54:18,048 --> 00:54:20,967
You know Mr. Kreigers
ordered that from TV late at night.

698
00:54:21,051 --> 00:54:23,678
Look, it's the Baldinos' barbecue tree stump.

699
00:54:23,762 --> 00:54:26,473
I have never seen them barbecue
on that thing.

700
00:54:26,556 --> 00:54:29,601
Actually, it's an escape tunnel
for Sammy the Shark.

701
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,978
It leads to a river
where he keeps his speedboat.

702
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:34,230
Yeah,
I mean Paul goes down there all the time.

703
00:54:34,314 --> 00:54:37,400
He can get into anyone's basement
through the storm sewers.

704
00:54:37,484 --> 00:54:39,486
- No way.
- Yeah.

705
00:54:39,569 --> 00:54:41,071
Cool.

706
00:54:54,459 --> 00:54:56,169
Dad'll smell it on you.

707
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,129
No, I got mints.

708
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,840
He'll smell it on your clothes.

709
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:04,010
I'll just tell him some kids
were smoking in the bathroom.

710
00:55:06,346 --> 00:55:08,264
Don't let it die a virgin.

711
00:55:08,348 --> 00:55:10,934
- That's gross.
- Yeah, grow up, Conley.

00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:03,004
The dance committee headed by Sabrina Gonner
really outdid themselves this time.

736
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:06,633
I'd, uh, like to open the voting

We've gotta go back in a minute.

01:01:13,171 --> 01:01:16,466
We can keep an eye on the car.
It won't leave without us.

01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:19,969
My dad.

793
01:01:21,179 --> 01:01:24,223

put your crown in your locker.

01:01:26,184 --> 01:01:28,603

- Uh-huh.

- Uh-huh.

798
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:38,738
Maybe they went home with your dad.

799
01:01:38,821 --> 01:01:40,323

01:02:03,638 --> 01:02:05,973

01:02:23,783 --> 01:02:25,284

815
01:05:23,170 --> 01:05:25,464

01:05:28,092 --> 01:05:29,719

819
01:05:44,525 --> 01:05:47,612
<i>I mean, I liked her. I liked her a lot.</i>

820
01:05:47,695 --> 01:05:49,697
<i>But out there on the field...</i>

821
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,452
It was just different then.

822
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,665
That was the last time I saw her.

823
01:06:02,877 --> 01:06:06,088
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

824
01:06:07,131 --> 01:06:09,467
But at least I tasted it once, right?

825
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:17,224

826
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:36,577
<i>Given Lux's failure to make curfew,

01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:41,999
<i>But few anticipated
it would be so drastic.</i>

828
01:06:43,668 --> 01:06:45,294
<i>The girls were taken out of school,</i>

829
01:06:45,378 --> 01:06:49,465
<i>and Mrs. Lisbon shut the house
in maximum security isolation.</i>

830
01:06:51,550 --> 01:06:54,512
<i>She had done more
than just take the girls out of school.</i>

831
01:06:54,595 --> 01:06:57,848
<i>That Sunday, arriving home
from a spirited church sermon,</i>

832
01:06:57,932 --> 01:07:01,102
<i>Mrs. Lisbon commanded Lux
to destroy her rock records.</i>

833
01:07:01,185 --> 01:07:02,895
Now.

834
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:05,022
But, Mom.

835
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:07,525
This is final, Luxie.

836
01:07:07,608 --> 01:07:09,360
That's not fair!

837
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:11,362
I said, now.

838
01:07:28,587 --> 01:07:30,423
Now, Luxie!

839
01:07:43,811 --> 01:07:45,730
Come on.

840
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:47,314
Hold on.

841
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:54,029

842
01:07:54,113 --> 01:07:55,614
Burn it.

843
01:08:08,544 --> 01:08:10,713
Oh, Mom. Aerosmith.

844
01:08:10,796 --> 01:08:12,757
- Come on. Please, don't make me burn this.
- No.

845
01:08:12,840 --> 01:08:15,050
Please.

846
01:08:15,134 --> 01:08:17,386
What's that smell?

847
01:08:17,470 --> 01:08:20,681
It's — All right. Um, that'll do for now.

848
01:08:20,765 --> 01:08:22,725
Give me these. Give me these.

849
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:25,728
I'll put them in the trash.

850
01:08:58,219 --> 01:09:02,139
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

851
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:05,518
<i>This was around the time
we began to see Lux</i>

852
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:08,270

853
01:09:08,354 --> 01:09:10,523
- What else? Come on. Is she naked?
- What's she doing?

854
01:09:10,606 --> 01:09:12,900
- You can't tell. Hold on.
- Get it focused.

855
01:09:12,983 --> 01:09:15,861
- You're pushin' it. What are you doing?
- Will you stop?

856
01:09:15,945 --> 01:09:17,947
- Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

857
01:09:18,030 --> 01:09:20,366
They're rolling around up there.

858
01:09:20,449 --> 01:09:22,284
Let me see. Let me see. Off.

859
01:09:22,368 --> 01:09:23,869
- Hold on.
- All right, come on.

860
01:09:24,036 --> 01:09:26,473
And she's on him.
And he's rubbing his hands through her hair.

861
01:09:26,497 --> 01:09:27,957
- Let me have a look.
- No. No, no.

862
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:30,417
It's my t — It's my telescope, Chase.

863
01:09:31,210 --> 01:09:33,754
Yes, and what else?

864
01:09:33,838 --> 01:09:37,967
Our male up there seems to be
in a Burger Chalet uniform.

865
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,885
Let me see.

866
01:09:39,969 --> 01:09:41,804
Is it — Yeah, the Burger Chalet —

867
01:09:41,887 --> 01:09:44,515
You never think that those guys,
you know, ever get lucky.

868
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:48,143
She turns to me and asks me if I thought
what we had just done was dirty.

869
01:09:48,227 --> 01:09:50,563
I knew what to say. I said no.

870
01:09:50,646 --> 01:09:53,649
Then she grabs my hand and goes,
"You like me, don't you?"

871
01:09:53,732 --> 01:09:56,861
I didn't say anything.
You know, it's best to keep chicks guessing.

872
01:09:57,736 --> 01:10:01,574
Chase, honey,
come practice your violin before dinner.

873
01:10:04,034 --> 01:10:05,578
You're not gonna believe it.

874
01:10:05,661 --> 01:10:08,581
Lux is on the roof again tonight.

875
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:11,709
- Her hands are moving down.
- I gotta see this.

876
01:10:11,792 --> 01:10:13,544
- Oh.
- This is beautiful.

877
01:10:13,627 --> 01:10:15,921
Now she's on top of him.

878
01:10:16,714 --> 01:10:18,924
- What's she doin', man?
- Wait.

879
01:10:20,259 --> 01:10:22,678
Now they're done. He's getting up.

880
01:10:25,222 --> 01:10:26,724
That's it?

881
01:10:27,474 --> 01:10:28,767
That was quick.

882
01:10:35,441 --> 01:10:39,236
"N" plus one, and, uh,

883
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:42,489
if the dimension is time,
then you would have as your approach —

884
01:10:42,573 --> 01:10:46,035
Oh, good morning. Good morning —

885
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:48,996
Have we photosynthesized
our breakfast today?

886
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:01,634
Hello, Ronald.

887
01:11:02,676 --> 01:11:04,303
Hi, Eric.

888
01:11:04,386 --> 01:11:07,973
Your daughters haven't been in school
for over two weeks.

889
01:11:10,184 --> 01:11:12,186
You checked out back?

890
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:19,526
<i>Dini Flasher said
they found a new math teacher.</i>

891
01:11:20,194 --> 01:11:22,464
Well, he's gonna have to get another job,
that's for sure.

892
01:11:22,488 --> 01:11:23,989
I know.

893
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:28,118
How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

894
01:11:48,764 --> 01:11:50,307
Just go away. This is our tree.

895
01:11:50,391 --> 01:11:54,019
Girls. Girls, it's a little late.

896
01:11:54,103 --> 01:11:55,479
Okay, this tree is dead.

897
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,165
Why don't you just leave it up to nature?

898
01:11:57,189 --> 01:11:59,250
If we left it up to nature,
there'd be no trees left.

899
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:01,402
That's what it's gonna be like anyway.

900
01:12:01,485 --> 01:12:03,445
If the boats didn't bring the fungus
from Europe,

901
01:12:03,529 --> 01:12:05,614
none of this would've happened
in the first place.

902
01:12:05,698 --> 01:12:08,617
Okay. Let's go.

903
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:11,328
No?

904
01:12:11,412 --> 01:12:13,706
All right, that's it.

905
01:12:13,789 --> 01:12:16,792
I have an order to cut down your elm tree,
but your kids won't let us.

906
01:12:16,875 --> 01:12:18,168
Dear?

907
01:12:18,252 --> 01:12:20,587
- How do you know that tree's sick?
- Believe me, we know.

908
01:12:20,671 --> 01:12:22,941
It had yellow leaves.
The tree is dead, for Christ's sake.

909
01:12:22,965 --> 01:12:25,592
Are you familiar with Aritex?
Our daughter showed us an article.

910
01:12:25,676 --> 01:12:27,570
- It's a less aggressive therapy.
- And it doesn't work.

911
01:12:27,594 --> 01:12:29,096
- Ah.
- I leave that tree there,

912
01:12:29,179 --> 01:12:30,597
they'll all be gone by next year.

913
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:32,433
Will be anyway... way things are going.

914
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:34,869
Look, I don't wanna have to call the police.

915
01:12:34,893 --> 01:12:37,354
Our daughters are simply
standing on their own front lawn.

916
01:12:37,438 --> 01:12:39,273
Since when is that a crime?

917
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:44,862
Uh —

918
01:12:54,913 --> 01:12:57,374
Clyde? Did you see those girls
in the — in the nighties?

919
01:12:57,458 --> 01:13:00,169
That's what I want.
That's the shot that I want. Okay?

920
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:03,064
Honey, you're gonna have to move forward.
I want those girls in the nighties.

921
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:04,631
Oh, God. Okay.

922
01:13:04,715 --> 01:13:07,092
Here, let's just back up a little bit here.

923
01:13:07,176 --> 01:13:10,095
- Give me some slack.
- There you go. Is that good?

924
01:13:10,179 --> 01:13:11,805
- Okay?
- Great.

925
01:13:12,681 --> 01:13:15,893
<i>Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,
the east-side teenager</i>

926
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:20,189
<i>whose suicide last summer
focused awareness on a national problem,</i>

927
01:13:20,272 --> 01:13:22,024
<i>put their own lives in jeopardy</i>

928
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:25,778
<i>by trying to protect the elm
that Cecilia so dearly loved.</i>

929
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:16,870
The circles under your eyes
come out more when you're in overcast.

930
01:14:16,954 --> 01:14:19,456
All right? So you need to wear
more concealer when it's cloudy.

931
01:14:19,540 --> 01:14:22,835
<i>For the next few weeks,
we hardly saw the girls at all.</i>

932
01:14:24,128 --> 01:14:26,964
<i>Joe Hill Conley didn't call Therese
as he had promised.</i>

933
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,716
So we need more colors.

934
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:34,972
<i>And Lux never spoke to Trip again.</i>

935
01:14:35,055 --> 01:14:37,599
So, you should tone it down a bit.
But in the shade —

936
01:14:38,684 --> 01:14:40,686
<i>You're a stone fox.</i>

937
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:48,402
<i>The girls' only contact
with the outside world</i>

938
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,487
<i>was through the catalogs they ordered</i>

939
01:14:50,571 --> 01:14:52,614
<i>that started to fill the Lisbons' mailbox</i>

940
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:57,494
<i>with pictures of high-end fashions
and brochures for exotic vacations.</i>

941
01:14:59,037 --> 01:15:01,915
<i>Unable to go anywhere,
the girls traveled in their imaginations</i>

942
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:04,376
<i>to gold-tipped Siamese temples,</i>

943
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:09,131
<i>or past an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.</i>

944
01:15:12,467 --> 01:15:14,928
<i>We ordered the same catalogs,</i>

945
01:15:15,012 --> 01:15:18,974
<i>and flipping through the pages,
we hiked through dusty passes with the girls,</i>

946
01:15:19,057 --> 01:15:22,186
<i>stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks...</i>

947
01:15:23,395 --> 01:15:26,690
<i>placing our hands on their warm,
moist shoulders,</i>

948
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:29,109
<i>and gazing off at papaya sunsets.</i>

949
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:34,323
<i>We drank tea with them in a water pavilion.</i>

950
01:15:34,406 --> 01:15:36,366
<i>We did whatever we wanted.</i>

951
01:15:38,202 --> 01:15:39,953
<i>Cecilia hadn't died.</i>

952
01:15:40,746 --> 01:15:42,873
<i>She was a bride in Calcutta.</i>

953
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:47,753
<i>The only way
we could feel close to the girls</i>

954
01:15:47,836 --> 01:15:51,632
<i>was through these impossible excursions,
which have scarred us forever...</i>

955
01:15:53,091 --> 01:15:56,178
<i>making us happier with dreams than wives.</i>

956
01:15:58,388 --> 01:16:00,724
<i>Collecting everything we could of theirs,</i>

957
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:03,435
<i>the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds.</i>

958
01:16:03,518 --> 01:16:05,896
<i>But they were slipping away.</i>

959
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:10,567
<i>The color of their eyes was fading, along with
the exact locations of moles and dimples.</i>

960
01:16:11,401 --> 01:16:13,278
<i>From five they had become four,</i>

961
01:16:13,362 --> 01:16:16,198
<i>and they were all, the living and the dead,</i>

962
01:16:16,281 --> 01:16:18,825
<i>becoming shadows.</i>

963
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:21,828
<i>We would have lost them completely
if the girls hadn't contacted us.</i>

964
01:16:21,912 --> 01:16:23,705
Okay, one long.

965
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:26,708
Two short.

966
01:16:27,376 --> 01:16:29,044
- And one long.
- Mm-hmm.

967
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:31,296
You got that? That's it.

968
01:16:32,047 --> 01:16:33,548
Okay.

969
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:36,260
Help.

970
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:38,929
Send...

971
01:16:40,555 --> 01:16:42,057
bo...

972
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,059
bo.

973
01:16:45,978 --> 01:16:47,479
- Bobo?
- Bobo.

974
01:16:47,562 --> 01:16:49,690
I just — Watch this.

975
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:50,774
Bobo.

976
01:16:50,857 --> 01:16:53,318
Help send bobo?

977
01:16:53,402 --> 01:16:55,028
I thought you knew Morse code.

978
01:17:23,432 --> 01:17:25,600
Something here for you.

979
01:17:33,317 --> 01:17:35,277
I got one too.

980
01:17:37,779 --> 01:17:40,657
<i>We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.</i>

981
01:17:40,741 --> 01:17:44,953
<i>Tom Fahey suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house,</i>

982
01:17:45,037 --> 01:17:47,664
<i>but that had logistical problems.</i>

983
01:17:47,748 --> 01:17:50,667
<i>In the end, the answer was so simple
it took a week to come up with.</i>

984
01:17:51,251 --> 01:17:53,337
<i>We called them on the telephone.</i>

985
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:56,214
727-8221.

986
01:17:56,298 --> 01:17:57,966
8221.

987
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,760
Get ready.

988
01:18:03,055 --> 01:18:04,514

I gotta go home. See you tomorrow.

I'll see you later.

1012
01:19:50,620 --> 01:19:52,873
- I'm-I'm just perplexed.
- We're suffocating.

1013
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:56,460
- You're safe here.
- I can't breathe in here.

1014
01:19:58,128 --> 01:19:59,629
No answer.

1015
01:20:22,527 --> 01:20:24,654
- What time is it?
- Anytime now.

1016
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:27,699
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

1017
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:33,246
Yeah, it's them.

1018
01:20:35,081 --> 01:20:36,625
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1019
01:20:48,303 --> 01:20:50,722
I got the keys to my mom's car.

1020
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:00,607
Shh!

1021
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,067
Shh.

1022
01:21:14,996 --> 01:21:17,290
Maybe we should knock.

1023
01:21:17,374 --> 01:21:19,125
Yeah.

1024
01:21:23,505 --> 01:21:24,714
We're here.

1025
01:21:34,599 --> 01:21:36,601
About time.

1026
01:21:36,685 --> 01:21:39,271
We've been waiting for you guys.

1027
01:21:39,354 --> 01:21:42,899
We got a car. We got a full tank of gas.
We'll take you anywhere you wanna go.

1028
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:45,235
It's just a Cougar,
but it's got a pretty big trunk.

1029
01:21:46,278 --> 01:21:47,988
Can I sit up front?

1030
01:21:49,197 --> 01:21:50,407
Sure.

1031
01:21:53,201 --> 01:21:56,371
Which one of you
is gonna sit up front next to me?

1032
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,416
Where are your parents?

1033
01:22:00,625 --> 01:22:01,626
Asleep.

1034
01:22:01,710 --> 01:22:03,545
What about your sisters?

1035
01:22:04,212 --> 01:22:05,297
They're coming.

1036
01:22:06,214 --> 01:22:08,592
Come on. It's getting late.

1037
01:22:10,010 --> 01:22:13,305
Wait five minutes. We had to wait
until my parents were asleep.

1038
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:15,807
They take forever.

1039
01:22:15,890 --> 01:22:17,809
My mom's an insomniac.

1040
01:22:21,813 --> 01:22:24,107
We better take our car. There's more room.

1041
01:22:26,526 --> 01:22:28,528
Think you can handle a station wagon?

1042
01:22:29,696 --> 01:22:31,031
Sure.

1043
01:22:31,114 --> 01:22:33,658
- It's not a stick, is it?
- No.

1044
01:22:33,742 --> 01:22:35,243
Yeah, no problem.

1045
01:22:35,327 --> 01:22:37,787
Will you let me steer?

1046
01:22:37,871 --> 01:22:38,872
Sure.

1047
01:22:38,955 --> 01:22:41,499
But maybe we should get out of here.
I just heard something.

1048
01:22:41,583 --> 01:22:44,085
- It could be your mom.
- Come on in.

1049
01:22:55,180 --> 01:22:57,432
I'll go wait in the car.

1050
01:22:57,515 --> 01:22:59,434
You guys wait here for my sisters.

1051
01:23:53,780 --> 01:23:56,991
Oops. These girls make me crazy.

1052
01:23:57,075 --> 01:23:59,536
If I could just feel one of 'em up just once.

1053
01:24:03,206 --> 01:24:04,708
What?

1054
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,937
<i>We would never be sure
about the sequence of events.</i>

1055
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:27,939
<i>We argue about it still.</i>

1056
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:35,029
<i>Most likely Bonnie had died
while we were waiting in the living room,</i>

1057
01:24:35,113 --> 01:24:36,948
<i>dreaming of highways.</i>

1058
01:24:38,241 --> 01:24:41,161
<i>Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.</i>

1059
01:24:42,245 --> 01:24:46,207
<i>Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.</i>

1060
01:24:48,042 --> 01:24:49,544
<i>Lux was the last to go.</i>

1061
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:01,514
<i>It's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.</i>

1062
01:25:01,598 --> 01:25:03,641
<i>Do you know where your children are?</i>

1063
01:25:03,725 --> 01:25:08,646
<i>Bonnie, the youngest Lisbon sister,
strangely wore a 1920s wedding dress.</i>

1064
01:25:08,730 --> 01:25:12,358
<i>Therese Lisbon, a horse lover, had written
to the Brown University admissions office —</i>

1065
01:25:12,442 --> 01:25:15,653
<i>Yeah, Mary always wanted to be a cheerleader,
but her mother wouldn't let her,</i>

1066
01:25:15,737 --> 01:25:18,198
<i>so I was teaching her the cheers.</i>

1067
01:25:19,491 --> 01:25:21,117
<i>This has been Lydia Perl</i>

1068
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:23,203
<i>with Channel 8 news.</i>

1069
01:25:32,295 --> 01:25:35,882
<i>None of my daughters lacked for any love.</i>

1070
01:25:37,467 --> 01:25:40,094
<i>There was plenty of love in our house.</i>

1071
01:25:41,971 --> 01:25:44,057
<i>I never understood why.</i>

1072
01:26:16,256 --> 01:26:18,174
<i>After the suicide free-for-all,</i>

1073
01:26:18,258 --> 01:26:21,845
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon gave up
any attempt to lead a normal life.</i>

1074
01:26:24,264 --> 01:26:27,016
<i>They had Mr. Headley pack up the house,</i>

1075
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,228
<i>selling what furniture he could
in a garage sale.</i>

1076
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:37,110
<i>Mr. Lisbon put the house on the market,
and it was sold to a young couple from Boston.</i>

1077
01:26:39,112 --> 01:26:42,615
<i>We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.</i>

1078
01:26:45,660 --> 01:26:47,662
<i>In the end, we had pieces of the puzzle,</i>

1079
01:26:47,745 --> 01:26:50,665
<i>but no matter how we put them together,
gaps remained.</i>

1080
01:26:51,457 --> 01:26:55,086
<i>Oddly shaped emptiness mapped
by what surrounded them.</i>

1081
01:26:55,169 --> 01:26:57,171
<i>Like countries we couldn't name.</i>

1082
01:27:00,967 --> 01:27:03,177
<i>What lingered after them was not life...</i>

1083
01:27:04,512 --> 01:27:07,599
<i>but the most trivial list of mundane facts.</i>

1084
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:12,228
<i>A clock ticking on the wall.</i>

1085
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,107
<i>A room dim at noon.</i>

1086
01:27:17,525 --> 01:27:21,738
<i>The outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.</i>

1087
01:27:26,784 --> 01:27:30,204
<i>We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.</i>

1088
01:27:37,253 --> 01:27:39,964
<i>Our parents seemed better able to do this,</i>

1089
01:27:40,048 --> 01:27:42,967
<i>returning to their tennis foursomes
and cocktail cruises</i>

1090
01:27:43,051 --> 01:27:45,345
<i>as though they'd seen this all before.</i>

1091
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:49,766
<i>It was full-fledged summer again,</i>

1092
01:27:49,849 --> 01:27:53,144
<i>over a year from the time
Cecilia had slit her wrists,</i>

1093
01:27:53,227 --> 01:27:55,229
<i>spreading the poison in the air.</i>

1094
01:27:56,439 --> 01:27:58,858
<i>A spill at the plant increased
the phosphates in the lake</i>

1095
01:27:58,942 --> 01:28:03,279
<i>and produced a scum of algae so thick
that the swamp smell filled the air,</i>

1096
01:28:03,363 --> 01:28:05,573
<i>infiltrating the genteel mansions.</i>

1097
01:28:06,950 --> 01:28:09,911
<i>Debutantes cried over the misfortune
of coming out in a season</i>

1098
01:28:09,994 --> 01:28:12,497
<i>everyone would remember for its bad smell.</i>

1099
01:28:13,998 --> 01:28:16,417
<i>The O'Connors, however,
came up with the ingenious solution</i>

1100
01:28:16,501 --> 01:28:19,587
<i>of making the theme of their
daughter Alice's debutante party</i>

1101
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:21,297
<i>asphyxiation.</i>

1102
01:28:22,465 --> 01:28:26,302
<i>Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.</i>

1103
01:29:21,274 --> 01:29:23,735
Al's got the, uh, acting bug.

1104
01:29:25,278 --> 01:29:27,697
She caught it from Pinkie.

1105
01:29:28,990 --> 01:29:31,993
And I wanna announce tonight
that next fall,

1106
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:35,455
Alice is going to a little school
in New Haven.

1107
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:41,461
I hear they have a great drama school.

1108
01:29:41,544 --> 01:29:44,380
In fact, Sam,
I think your father built it, didn't he?

1109
01:29:44,464 --> 01:29:47,550
That's the law school.

1110
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:50,636
We're so proud of Alice.
We really couldn't be prouder.

1111
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:53,639
- Aw. Cheers.
- Cheers.

1112
01:29:59,687 --> 01:30:01,689
I've had it.

1113
01:30:01,773 --> 01:30:04,025
Good-bye, cruel world.

1114
01:30:10,198 --> 01:30:13,034
No, no, no. You don't understand me.

1115
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:15,453
I'm a teenager. I got problems.

1116
01:30:26,798 --> 01:30:29,967
<i>So much has been said
about the girls over the years...</i>

1117
01:30:31,719 --> 01:30:33,930
<i>but we have never found an answer.</i>

1118
01:30:36,974 --> 01:30:39,268
<i>It didn't matter in the end
how old they had been...</i>

1119
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:43,523
<i>or that they were girls.</i>

1120
01:30:46,275 --> 01:30:48,444
<i>But only that we had loved them...</i>

1121
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:51,697
<i>and that they hadn't heard us calling,</i>

1122
01:30:51,781 --> 01:30:54,909
<i>still do not hear us calling them
out of those rooms...</i>

1123
01:30:56,077 --> 01:30:58,704
<i>where they went to be alone for all time...</i>

1124
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:04,210
<i>and where we will never find the pieces
to put them back together.</i>
