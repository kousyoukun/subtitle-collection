1
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:31,997
Cecilia was the first to go.

2
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:17,677
What are you doing here? You're not
old enough to know how bad life gets.

3
00:02:18,718 --> 00:02:23,155
Obviously, doctor,
you've never been a 13-year-old girl.

4
00:02:57,591 --> 00:03:00,526
Everyone dates
the demise of our neighborhood

5
00:03:00,694 --> 00:03:03,060
from the suicides of the Lisbon girls.

6
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:08,497
People saw their clairvoyants
in the wiped out elms, the harsh sunlight,

7
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:12,866
and the continuing decline
of our auto industry.

8
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,497
Even then
we tried putting the pieces together.

9
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:18,940
We still can't.

10
00:03:19,112 --> 00:03:22,741
Whenever we meet
at business lunches or cocktail parties

11
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,680
we go over the evidence one more time.

12
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:28,946
All to understand those five girls,

13
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:32,785
who, after all these years,
we can't get out of our minds.

14
00:03:35,228 --> 00:03:38,129
Cecilia, the youngest, was 1 2.

15
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,794
And Lux was 1 4.

16
00:03:45,472 --> 00:03:48,032
Bonnie was 1 5.

17
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,402
Mary was 16.

18
00:03:52,913 --> 00:03:55,711
And Therese was 1 7.

19
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:02,552
No one understood how Mr Lisbon,
our Math teacher,

20
00:04:02,722 --> 00:04:05,190
had produced such beautiful creatures.

21
00:04:08,295 --> 00:04:12,095
Paul Baldino said he found Cecilia
on her first attempt.

22
00:04:12,265 --> 00:04:14,460
l was the one who found her.

23
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:19,799
l was in the sewers. Through those tunnels
you can get into anyone's house.

24
00:04:20,006 --> 00:04:24,966
We believed him because
Paul's dad was Sammy the Shark Baldino

25
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:28,137
and his escape tunnel
led through the sewers.

26
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:32,911
So l wanted to see one
of those lesbian girls taking a shower.

27
00:04:33,086 --> 00:04:34,178
Yeah, right.

28
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:38,154
And l walk in...
And l see blood everywhere!

29
00:04:38,325 --> 00:04:42,159
So l turned around
and went right back out the tunnel.

30
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:47,533
l had to tell you guys that story.
See you guys later.

31
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:53,169
l heard it was an accident.

32
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,834
lt was no accident.
The parents are to blame.

33
00:04:58,044 --> 00:05:00,740
l heard they found the razor in the toilet.

34
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:03,906
Everyone had opinions
why Cecilia tried to kill herself.

35
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:07,709
That girl didn't want to die,
she just wanted out of that house.

36
00:05:07,887 --> 00:05:10,947
She wanted out of that decorating scheme.

37
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:19,729
The most popular theory
held Dominic Palazzolo to blame.

38
00:05:19,899 --> 00:05:22,367
Dominic was an immigrant
who was staying with relatives

39
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,763
until his family got settled in New Mexico.

40
00:05:24,938 --> 00:05:27,907
He was the first boy here
to wear sunglasses.

41
00:05:28,074 --> 00:05:30,542
Within a week of arriving he'd fallen in love.

42
00:05:31,745 --> 00:05:35,681
The object of his desire wasn't Cecilia,
but Diana Porter.

43
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,518
l love her!

44
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:46,887
When Diana Porter left on vacation,
Dominic denounced God.

45
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:52,930
And to prove his love, he jumped
off the roof of his relatives' house.

46
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,181
l'm going to show you some images.

47
00:06:19,926 --> 00:06:22,759
And... er, you tell me

48
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,329
what they remind you of.

49
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,858
OK?

50
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:48,751
A banana.

51
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,419
A swamp.

52
00:07:05,305 --> 00:07:07,239
An Afro.

53
00:07:25,658 --> 00:07:29,253
l don't think that Cecilia
truly meant to end her life.

54
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,864
Her act was a cry for help.

55
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,767
l know you're very strict,

56
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,802
but l think that Cecilia would benefit

57
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:43,942
by having a social outlet
outside of the codification of school.

58
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:47,677
And interact with males her own age.

59
00:07:56,356 --> 00:08:01,123
Peter helped Mr Lisbon install a model
of the solar system in his classroom.

60
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:04,092
ln return, Mr Lisbon invited him for dinner.

61
00:08:04,597 --> 00:08:06,895
Bless us, O Lord, in these, Thy gifts

62
00:08:07,066 --> 00:08:10,934
which we receive
from Thy bounty through Christ. Amen.

63
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:12,833
Amen.

64
00:08:13,006 --> 00:08:16,305
- Lux, please put your shirt on this instant.
- Sorry.

65
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,345
- Thank you, dear.
- Can you pass the salt, please?

66
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:27,144
- Ham?
- Thank you.

67
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,654
- Sweetheart, would you like some peas?
- l hate peas.

68
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,487
lt's a nice-looking ham, dear.

69
00:08:36,496 --> 00:08:40,296
- Well, thank you, honey.
- This is good, mum.

70
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:43,663
So, Peter, are you an aviation enthusiast?

71
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:47,771
Well, l don't know
if l'd call myself an enthusiast.

72
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,966
l like planes.

73
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:56,006
Peter, are you on the football squad?

74
00:08:56,216 --> 00:08:59,617
No. l play, but l'm not on the team.

75
00:08:59,819 --> 00:09:02,151
- Oh, l see.
- Not a team player.

76
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:04,915
Do you like to wrestle?

77
00:09:06,259 --> 00:09:08,284
Are you OK?

78
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:12,658
A Brazilian frog entered
the endangered species list today.

79
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:18,728
- That's the third animal this year.
- Oh, dear. Darling, l've never heard of it.

80
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:22,534
- Excuse me. May l use the restroom?
- Of course.

81
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,702
The one down here isn't working.
Go upstairs through Cecilia's room.

82
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,472
OK, thanks.

83
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:39,709
Hold on.

84
00:10:39,886 --> 00:10:42,116
l thought you'd died in there.

85
00:10:43,656 --> 00:10:47,057
Are you done hogging the bathroom?
l need something.

86
00:10:54,133 --> 00:10:56,260
Do you mind?

87
00:11:03,743 --> 00:11:06,940
- Thank you.
- Are you forgetting something?

88
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:14,108
- Peter, here's an air foil...
- Thank you.

89
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:18,155
lt's a demonstration
of Bernoulli's Principle.

90
00:11:18,324 --> 00:11:20,315
Lift...

91
00:11:22,729 --> 00:11:26,756
From then on
the Lisbon house began to change.

92
00:11:29,369 --> 00:11:34,500
Almost every day, and even when
she wasn't keeping an eye on Cecilia,

93
00:11:34,674 --> 00:11:37,768
Lux would suntan on her towel,
wearing a swimsuit

94
00:11:37,944 --> 00:11:42,643
that caused the knife-sharpener to give her
a 1 5-minute demonstration for free.

95
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:50,179
Following the doctor's orders,
two weeks after Cecilia returned home

96
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:57,118
Mr Lisbon persuaded his wife to let the girls
throw the only party of their short lives.

97
00:12:05,838 --> 00:12:08,204
There. ls that OK?

98
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:12,477
l've got to get dressed.

99
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,380
- Welcome.
- Good evening, Mrs Lisbon.

100
00:12:23,623 --> 00:12:25,716
Come on in.

101
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,554
The party's in the basement.

102
00:12:33,566 --> 00:12:37,969
Just go to the left
and then down the stairs.

103
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:52,776
Hi, l'm Bonnie.

104
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:56,355
- Hi... Tim.
- Nice to meet you.

105
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,459
- Would you like some punch?
- Yeah.

106
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,763
Thanks.

107
00:13:05,932 --> 00:13:08,992
- Hi.
- Thanks.

108
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:13,265
- Hi.
- Thank you.

109
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,605
- Hey.
- Hi.

110
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:20,870
- Do you want to sit down?
- Yeah.

111
00:14:03,422 --> 00:14:07,518
- How did your SATs go?
- OK.

112
00:14:07,693 --> 00:14:09,684
Good.

113
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:13,497
Do you know
where you're applying yet?

114
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,102
No, but my parents
are pushing towards Yale.

115
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:21,468
- Because that's where my dad went.
- That's nice.

116
00:14:25,411 --> 00:14:28,141
You have to imagine the clouds opening up

117
00:14:28,314 --> 00:14:32,080
and out of the sun
would come the Hun in his Messerschmitt.

118
00:14:32,251 --> 00:14:37,018
And boys, just older than you,
would be in this, the P51 B Mustang.

119
00:14:37,223 --> 00:14:38,918
''B'' for bull's-eye.

120
00:14:41,694 --> 00:14:45,027
- You've heard of Yale?
- Oh, yeah.

121
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:49,760
- This punch is fantastic.
- More?

122
00:14:49,936 --> 00:14:51,198
What's in it?

123
00:14:52,705 --> 00:14:55,970
Juices, some cherry... pineapple.

124
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,807
You know, l... l love pineapple.

125
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:02,981
Really?

126
00:15:11,824 --> 00:15:16,659
This baby would come in.
This won the war for the United Kingdom.

127
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:19,992
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

128
00:15:21,033 --> 00:15:27,905
And it's this kind of equipment
that makes a model work.

129
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,701
Here's Joe.

130
00:15:33,246 --> 00:15:35,339
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi.

131
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:41,585
- lf he needs anything, call me.
- l'm sure he'll be fine.

132
00:15:43,155 --> 00:15:46,386
- Hi.
- Hi.

133
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,720
Joe. Good to see you. How are you?

134
00:15:50,896 --> 00:15:53,922
- Glad you came tonight.
- How's it going?

135
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,965
You're just in time.

136
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:58,103
Hi.

137
00:15:58,237 --> 00:16:01,468
Look. His ears go
if you scratch his chin.

138
00:16:03,309 --> 00:16:05,300
Joe, sing your song.

139
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,071
Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

140
00:16:08,214 --> 00:16:13,174
Oh, the monkeys have no tails
They were bitten off by whales

141
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:17,254
Oh, the monkeys have no tails
in Zamboanga

142
00:16:19,992 --> 00:16:22,961
- Good song.
- Good job, Joe.

143
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:27,757
Where'd you learn that song?

144
00:16:28,868 --> 00:16:30,995
Can l be excused?

145
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:35,506
lf you want to, my dear,
but this is your party.

146
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:42,306
All right. lf you want to go upstairs, do.
We'll just...

147
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:45,916
We'll just have to have fun without you.

148
00:16:46,085 --> 00:16:48,349
Look. He always chooses heads.

149
00:16:48,554 --> 00:16:50,784
- Joe, what's it going to be?
- Heads.

150
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:52,924
Joe, try tails.

151
00:16:54,427 --> 00:16:55,621
Heads it is!

152
00:16:57,530 --> 00:16:59,725
- Let's go.
- Heads.

153
00:16:59,899 --> 00:17:02,834
Heads! One more time.

154
00:17:03,002 --> 00:17:04,902
- ln the air, Joe.
- Heads.

155
00:17:07,606 --> 00:17:09,540
Heads it is!

156
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:13,145
- One more time. Call in the air, Joe.
- Heads.

157
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,571
Heads. Not bad.

158
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,887
- How are you doing?
- Good.

159
00:17:23,522 --> 00:17:26,719
- He picked it up really well.
- This is my favorite song.

160
00:17:26,892 --> 00:17:31,386
You know, you're... very beautiful.
Like a saint.

161
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,360
l could paint you some time.

162
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,301
Thanks.

163
00:17:41,741 --> 00:17:43,003
Did they sing it?

164
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:46,735
Wow, that's good!

165
00:17:47,646 --> 00:17:49,079
God!

166
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:53,012
Oh, Lord!

167
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,187
Cecilia!

168
00:18:11,771 --> 00:18:15,332
Oh, my...! No! No, no, no!

169
00:18:15,574 --> 00:18:18,543
Don't look. Turn around.

170
00:18:18,711 --> 00:18:21,737
Turn around! Darlings, turn... Oh, my God!

171
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:26,244
Oh, Jesus!

172
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:28,444
Please, God.

173
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,897
We're here now.

174
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:23,307
No funerals today.

175
00:20:03,415 --> 00:20:05,508
He said she was only 1 2.

176
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,932
Hi, Mary. Are your parents home?

177
00:20:22,101 --> 00:20:24,763
Hi, Father. Come in.

178
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:34,041
Oh. Hello, Father.

179
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,009
Please, sit down.

180
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:40,174
Thanks.

181
00:20:40,352 --> 00:20:43,185
Come on, that was inside!

182
00:20:44,456 --> 00:20:46,720
Uh, no. No, thanks.

183
00:20:55,334 --> 00:20:59,395
How about we get the missus down here?
Have a little chat?

184
00:20:59,572 --> 00:21:01,870
l'm afraid she's under the weather.

185
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,373
She's not...

186
00:21:04,543 --> 00:21:06,704
seeing anybody.

187
00:21:08,747 --> 00:21:11,215
Well, she'll see her priest.

188
00:21:11,417 --> 00:21:14,818
This kid's a sucker
for the inside ones every time.

189
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:18,522
Every time.

190
00:21:18,691 --> 00:21:20,716
Excuse me.

191
00:21:23,529 --> 00:21:26,191
Father...

192
00:21:31,971 --> 00:21:34,303
Double play, Father.

193
00:21:36,075 --> 00:21:38,509
Double play.

194
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:02,392
Mrs Lisbon?

195
00:22:11,744 --> 00:22:14,406
- May l come in?
- OK.

196
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:22,110
Hello, girls. l thought we could talk.

197
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:26,520
Do you feel like talking?

198
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:29,624
Well... if you ever want to,

199
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:32,319
you know where to find me.

200
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:44,571
Mrs Lisbon? lt's Father Moody.

201
00:22:49,548 --> 00:22:51,948
Mrs Lisbon. Hello.

202
00:22:55,654 --> 00:23:00,717
l wanted you to know
that l listed Cecilia's death as an accident.

203
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,065
An accident waiting to happen.

204
00:23:17,242 --> 00:23:21,611
- They couldn't get a policy to cover it.
- lt's incredibly dangerous.

205
00:23:21,814 --> 00:23:24,009
Let's give it a try.

206
00:23:27,019 --> 00:23:30,386
Ready? One, two, three.

207
00:23:36,462 --> 00:23:39,329
lt's so sad, l can't believe it happened.

208
00:23:39,531 --> 00:23:42,557
Have you got that chain in your truck?

209
00:24:02,187 --> 00:24:03,984
Hit it!

210
00:24:18,837 --> 00:24:21,738
Our collection of souvenirs
of the Lisbon girls -

211
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:26,105
which still exists -
started with Cecilia's diary.

212
00:24:26,278 --> 00:24:31,682
Parkie had gotten it from the plumber's
assistant, who'd found it in the bathroom.

213
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,580
Tim Weiner, the Brain, decoded it.

214
00:24:34,753 --> 00:24:36,983
Emotional instability.

215
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:41,215
Look at the ''ls'', the dots on them.
They're everywhere.

216
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:45,825
Basically, what we have here is a dreamer.

217
00:24:46,031 --> 00:24:48,591
Someone completely
out of touch with reality.

218
00:24:48,734 --> 00:24:51,794
When she jumped,
she probably thought she would fly.

219
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:58,039
Monday, February 1 2th.
Today we had frozen pizza.

220
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:07,278
Thursday. Mum made cream corn
for dinner. lt's the worst. lt looks like...

221
00:25:08,587 --> 00:25:11,488
Mary chipped a tooth acting like an idiot.

222
00:25:11,657 --> 00:25:14,717
She made a scene
and had to get her tooth capped.

223
00:25:14,893 --> 00:25:17,157
- lt looks normal.
- Give me that.

224
00:25:18,864 --> 00:25:21,094
l said she had a capped tooth.

225
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:30,539
Elm trees! How many pages
can you write about dying trees?

226
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:34,478
Here's something about Dominic.

227
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:40,012
Palazzolo jumped off the roof today
over that rich bitch, Porter.

228
00:25:40,219 --> 00:25:43,086
How stupid can you be?

229
00:25:44,156 --> 00:25:48,718
Today we went out on the boat.
lt was cold. We saw a couple of whales.

230
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:52,330
Lux stroked the whale.
l didn't think they'd stink so much.

231
00:25:52,531 --> 00:25:55,125
lt's the kelp in their bellies rotting.

232
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,564
l hope we can go again some time.

233
00:25:57,736 --> 00:25:59,567
Let's read that.

234
00:25:59,738 --> 00:26:04,175
Lux lusted over Kevin... ls it ''Heinz''?
The garbage man.

235
00:26:04,376 --> 00:26:07,641
Lux lusted over Kevin Haines,
the garbage man.

236
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:11,715
She'd wake up at 5am
and hang out on the front steps.

237
00:26:11,884 --> 00:26:14,045
Like it wasn't completely obvious!

238
00:26:14,219 --> 00:26:16,847
She wrote his name
on all her underwear.

239
00:26:17,022 --> 00:26:19,752
Mum found them
and bleached out all the Kevins.

240
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:22,723
Lux is crying on her bed all day.

241
00:26:30,602 --> 00:26:33,662
''The trees, like lungs filling with air

242
00:26:33,839 --> 00:26:37,172
''My sister, the mean one, pulling my hair''

243
00:26:42,714 --> 00:26:46,013
And so we started to learn about their lives.

244
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,748
Coming to hold the memories
of times we hadn't experienced.

245
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:53,949
We felt the imprisonment of being a girl.

246
00:26:54,126 --> 00:26:56,822
How it made your mind
active and dreamy.

247
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:00,726
And how you learnt
what colors went together.

248
00:27:00,899 --> 00:27:03,333
We knew that the girls
were really women in disguise.

249
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:06,036
They understood love and even death.

250
00:27:06,204 --> 00:27:09,662
Our job was to create the noise
that fascinated them.

251
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:15,704
They knew everything about us,
but we couldn't fathom them at all.

252
00:27:30,629 --> 00:27:34,895
Hi. Mrs Lisbon, l'm Lydia Perl.
l'm putting together...

253
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,765
- Oh!
- Hi, l'm Bonnie. This is Mary.

254
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:44,204
Hello, girls. l'm here to ask you
a couple of questions...

255
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:46,468
about Cecilia.

256
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:51,145
- Yeah?
- Great. Um...

257
00:27:51,316 --> 00:27:55,480
Maybe you could tell me
a little bit about her?

258
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:59,982
Did she have any special interests
or hobbies?

259
00:28:00,158 --> 00:28:03,423
She liked writing her journal a lot.

260
00:28:03,595 --> 00:28:06,223
That is great.

261
00:28:06,431 --> 00:28:08,524
OK. Did she...

262
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,168
Did she ever talk about ending her life?

263
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,895
What's going on here?

264
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:16,336
You must be Mrs Lisbon.

265
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:19,237
l'm Lydia Perl.
l'm doing a piece for Channel Two.

266
00:28:19,411 --> 00:28:21,777
You have to leave now, Miss Perl.

267
00:28:22,848 --> 00:28:28,878
The suicide of a teenager last summer
has increased the awareness of a crisis.

268
00:28:29,054 --> 00:28:32,148
l'm at the home where Cecilia Lisbon...

269
00:28:32,224 --> 00:28:34,488
Why don't they let her rest in peace?

270
00:28:34,526 --> 00:28:38,155
..tragically put an end to her life.

271
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:40,696
Psychologists agree
that adolescence today

272
00:28:40,866 --> 00:28:45,166
is more fraught by pressures
and complexities than in years past.

273
00:28:45,337 --> 00:28:49,967
Doctors say that frustration
can lead to acts of violence

274
00:28:50,142 --> 00:28:55,705
whose reality the adolescent
cannot separate from its intended drama.

275
00:28:56,515 --> 00:28:59,006
l baked a pie full of rat poison.

276
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:03,747
l thought l could eat it
without it being suspicious.

277
00:29:06,024 --> 00:29:09,152
My nana, who was 86...

278
00:29:12,364 --> 00:29:15,162
She really likes sweets.

279
00:29:16,601 --> 00:29:19,263
She had three pieces.

280
00:29:24,876 --> 00:29:26,844
l'm sorriest for the mother.

281
00:29:27,012 --> 00:29:30,379
You'd always wonder
what you could have done.

282
00:29:30,582 --> 00:29:34,074
- l gotta go. See you later.
- All right. Bye-bye.

283
00:29:34,252 --> 00:29:36,152
Bye-bye.

284
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,577
Don't worry.

285
00:30:39,751 --> 00:30:42,515
They took the fence out.

286
00:31:03,508 --> 00:31:06,068
God, you snore loud.

287
00:31:51,089 --> 00:31:53,614
Those girls have a bright future ahead.

288
00:31:53,792 --> 00:31:57,193
The other one
was just going to end up a cook.

289
00:31:57,395 --> 00:32:02,162
We didn't see the girls together
as a group until September 7th.

290
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:05,861
Mary, Lux, Bonnie and Therese,

291
00:32:06,037 --> 00:32:08,904
came to school
as though nothing had happened.

292
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:14,979
We felt if we looked hard, we'd understand
their feelings and who they were.

293
00:32:15,146 --> 00:32:19,515
All right. These are Venn diagrams,
as you remember.

294
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:25,554
lf we have ''A'' and ''B'' intersecting.
And ''A'' and ''B''.

295
00:32:25,724 --> 00:32:29,216
lf ''A'' intersects ''B'', we have this area.

296
00:32:29,427 --> 00:32:34,364
And if ''A'' is the union with ''B'', we have
all of the circle plus the intersection.

297
00:32:34,566 --> 00:32:40,527
These are the laws
of intersection and union. OK?

298
00:32:51,349 --> 00:32:54,045
How's it going?

299
00:32:54,853 --> 00:32:57,048
Not bad.

300
00:33:00,325 --> 00:33:04,591
OK. ''Do a character sketch on the following
characters from Portrait Of A Lady...''

301
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:07,731
The first one is... Ralph.

302
00:33:07,932 --> 00:33:11,197
Um... He was nice.

303
00:33:11,403 --> 00:33:14,065
lt was really sad when he died.

304
00:33:16,074 --> 00:33:18,907
Oh, my gosh. l can't believe l just said that.

305
00:33:19,077 --> 00:33:21,375
l am so sorry.

306
00:33:33,291 --> 00:33:36,226
Reading about the alarming suicide rate,

307
00:33:36,428 --> 00:33:40,956
l talked to Mr Woodhouse
and some of the teachers here

308
00:33:41,132 --> 00:33:46,365
and realized that nothing about this serious
matter has been discussed at this school.

309
00:33:46,571 --> 00:33:49,734
And quickly thereafter
green pamphlets were distributed.

310
00:33:49,908 --> 00:33:53,639
We felt green was cheerful,
but not too cheerful.

311
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:56,370
Certainly better than red.

312
00:33:57,115 --> 00:34:01,916
The pamphlets said there were 80 suicides
a day in America - 30,000 a year.

313
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:03,349
Cheese!

314
00:34:03,588 --> 00:34:06,113
lt alerted us to danger signals
we couldn't help but look for.

315
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,953
Were the Lisbon girls' pupils dilated?

316
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:13,564
Had they lost interest in school activities
and sports and hobbies?

317
00:34:13,732 --> 00:34:16,098
Had they withdrawn from their peers?

318
00:34:17,869 --> 00:34:19,962
Hi, l'm Chase.

319
00:34:22,307 --> 00:34:24,741
l know who you are.

320
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:28,336
l've only been going to this school
my whole life.

321
00:34:29,547 --> 00:34:31,947
You don't have to talk to me.

322
00:34:41,426 --> 00:34:45,226
So, we have two different types
of economics.

323
00:34:45,430 --> 00:34:50,891
Of these different types
the first one is called macroeconomics.

324
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:52,502
Look.

325
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,968
She's laughing.

326
00:34:56,274 --> 00:35:00,938
He made her laugh. You never heard
him say anything remotely intelligent!

327
00:35:02,647 --> 00:35:08,279
The boys who talked with Lux were always
stupid and terrible sources of information.

328
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:10,954
..squeezebox. She's all right.

329
00:35:11,122 --> 00:35:14,319
Let me tell you,
she's the hottest girl in school.

330
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:18,292
You want to know what happened?
Smell my fingers, man.

331
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:21,294
No, she didn't talk about Cecilia.

332
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:24,491
We weren't exactly talking,
if you know what l mean.

333
00:35:24,669 --> 00:35:31,006
The only reliable boy who got to know Lux
was Trip Fontaine.

334
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:38,105
Who had recently lost his baby fat
to the delight of girls and mothers alike.

335
00:35:39,851 --> 00:35:41,785
l'm late again.

336
00:35:44,923 --> 00:35:47,187
Oh, come on!

337
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:57,999
Thank you.

338
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:11,508
All the girls at our school
are in love with Trip.

339
00:37:12,677 --> 00:37:14,907
All the girls, except Lux.

340
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:21,141
Trip said his passion for Lux began
when he went into the wrong History class.

341
00:37:22,453 --> 00:37:26,287
As was his custom,
he went out to smoke the marijuana

342
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:30,291
he took as regularly
as a diabetic kid takes lnsulin.

343
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:40,971
On this particular day, he avoided
Mr Woodhouse by ducking into a class.

344
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:58,715
She was the still point of the turning world.

345
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:03,091
l never got over that girl. Never.

346
00:38:05,363 --> 00:38:10,062
l've loved a lot of ladies, but not like that...
That was real.

347
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:13,965
l'll never forget the first time l saw her.

348
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:18,836
l didn't know what had hit me.
l didn't know what to do.

349
00:38:20,244 --> 00:38:25,307
Because it was so easy with all
the other girls, but she wouldn't look at me.

350
00:38:25,483 --> 00:38:30,352
l... l was never the kind to pursue.
lf you know what l mean.

351
00:38:34,525 --> 00:38:36,959
That girl drove me crazy, man.

352
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:54,104
Mmm, yummy.

353
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:56,611
Lux?

354
00:38:56,814 --> 00:38:58,748
Hey.

355
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:05,615
Look at it. lt's just meat on bread rolls.

356
00:39:07,692 --> 00:39:09,853
Thanks, Mum.

357
00:39:17,435 --> 00:39:20,029
Trip's dad was little help.

358
00:39:23,374 --> 00:39:27,105
Well, first off, don't call her on the phone.

359
00:39:27,278 --> 00:39:30,111
lt's all... lt's all subtlety.

360
00:39:30,281 --> 00:39:32,340
lt's all nuance.

361
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:35,509
Yeah. You just need to talk to her at school.

362
00:39:35,687 --> 00:39:39,919
About anything. About the weather,
or... school assignments.

363
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:46,155
Anything for the chance to communicate
with the language of eye contact.

364
00:39:46,631 --> 00:39:49,532
And project confidence.

365
00:39:50,401 --> 00:39:53,461
And keep the hair out of your eyes.

366
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:56,970
Feel the vibe.

367
00:40:03,815 --> 00:40:06,147
- Just do your stuff.
- Yeah.

368
00:40:09,954 --> 00:40:14,823
The word ''hurricane'' was the name given
to Nature's strongest storm.

369
00:40:15,026 --> 00:40:17,824
A hurricane occurs when high-pressure

370
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:22,295
and low-pressure masses of air
come into contact with one another.

371
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:26,733
There is often a significant difference
in temperature between the two masses.

372
00:40:28,573 --> 00:40:32,202
One mass is warm, while the other is cold.

373
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:37,042
The warmer air rises
and the cooler air falls.

374
00:40:38,249 --> 00:40:43,016
Likewise, the low-pressure area slides
down the sides of the high-pressure area.

375
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:45,519
They swirl around one another,

376
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,716
creating the beginnings of the storm.

377
00:40:50,561 --> 00:40:54,793
With this footage, taken from US Navy
weather patrol aircraft,

378
00:40:54,966 --> 00:41:01,701
we can observe the high and low-pressure
masses coming in contact with each other.

379
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:08,173
The result is a surging storm
of tremendous strength

380
00:41:08,346 --> 00:41:11,213
that strikes with forceful determination.

381
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:22,292
Even though the hurricane
is the most powerful storm known to us

382
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:27,297
it strikes large land areas
such as continents or large islands.

383
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:29,329
and slowly dies.

384
00:41:29,534 --> 00:41:33,197
Mr Montgomery, his ass is grass.

385
00:41:38,843 --> 00:41:41,038
l want to ask you out.

386
00:41:43,347 --> 00:41:45,406
Fat chance.

387
00:41:48,853 --> 00:41:52,914
First, l'll go over to your house
and watch the tube.

388
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,422
And then l'm gonna ask you out.

389
00:42:04,202 --> 00:42:06,670
You're the stone fox.

390
00:42:07,071 --> 00:42:13,010
The hurricane. One of the most awesome
and spectacular stories Nature has to offer.

391
00:42:20,818 --> 00:42:23,616
- What channel is this?
- Five.

392
00:42:23,821 --> 00:42:25,982
Oh. Let's see...

393
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:31,390
''Animals ln The Wild.
Journey through the African Kalahari

394
00:42:31,629 --> 00:42:34,598
''and see animals in their natural habitat.''

395
00:42:34,732 --> 00:42:38,395
l think that sounds nice, don't you?

396
00:42:38,636 --> 00:42:43,835
This huge rainforest eventually
gives way to grasslands

397
00:42:44,041 --> 00:42:48,740
that stretch to the horizon
in all directions - this is the Kalahari.

398
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:54,711
- Do you want some more pop?
- Yeah, sure. Thank you.

399
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,951
Thanks.

400
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:10,857
The wildlife spectacle
played out on these grasslands,

401
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:15,665
and in recesses of the rainforest,
is unparalleled anywhere on Earth.

402
00:43:25,116 --> 00:43:27,380
Lux, put your feet down, honey.

403
00:43:32,757 --> 00:43:37,751
The Kalahari and its vast open sky provide
a theatre for the life and death drama

404
00:43:37,929 --> 00:43:41,626
played out by the herds

405
00:43:41,832 --> 00:43:45,131
and the great
hunting cats that play on them.

406
00:43:45,303 --> 00:43:47,168
Oh, my!

407
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:50,205
lt's getting so late. Honey...?

408
00:43:54,045 --> 00:43:58,982
- l said it's getting late.
- Oh. Well, let's hit the TV button.

409
00:44:01,319 --> 00:44:03,287
Right. Er...

410
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:09,552
- OK.
- Thank you.

411
00:44:09,794 --> 00:44:13,195
- lt was nice to meet you Mrs Lisbon.
- Yes.

412
00:44:14,465 --> 00:44:16,990
- Good night.
- See you.

413
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:40,023
Bye.

414
00:44:45,429 --> 00:44:47,556
Goodbye.

415
00:45:54,865 --> 00:45:56,924
l've got to get back.

416
00:46:22,893 --> 00:46:26,260
This is fourth period,
l don't have you until fifth, do l?

417
00:46:26,464 --> 00:46:29,331
l know. l'm not here for math today, sir.

418
00:46:33,237 --> 00:46:37,697
l'm here to tell you that my intentions
for your daughter are entirely honorable.

419
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:45,676
- What might those intentions be?
- To ask Lux to the Homecoming Dance.

420
00:46:48,686 --> 00:46:51,348
Trip, why don't you sit down for a minute?

421
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:58,821
You see, my wife and l have certain rules.

422
00:46:58,963 --> 00:47:04,060
They were the rules for the older girls.
l can't change them for the younger ones.

423
00:47:04,235 --> 00:47:07,671
Even if l wanted to,
the wife wouldn't let me.

424
00:47:07,838 --> 00:47:13,435
So, if you want to come over and watch
television again, that would be fine.

425
00:47:13,611 --> 00:47:17,672
But you cannot take Lux out.
Especially not in a car.

426
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:21,443
So l'm sorry, son, that's just our policy.

427
00:47:23,687 --> 00:47:29,853
OK, sir. What if a bunch of us guys
took all your daughters out in a group

428
00:47:30,027 --> 00:47:33,121
and had them back by the time you said?

429
00:47:33,297 --> 00:47:36,755
- Are you on the football squad, son?
- Yes, sir.

430
00:47:36,934 --> 00:47:39,869
- What position?
- Defence quarterback.

431
00:47:40,004 --> 00:47:41,938
Ah, good.

432
00:47:42,106 --> 00:47:45,473
l was a... l was a safety in my day.

433
00:47:45,643 --> 00:47:47,907
Well, that's a crucial position, sir.

434
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:50,945
- Nothing between you and the goal line.
- Exactly!

435
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:54,882
- Oh, well.
- So the thing is, sir.

436
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:59,955
We've got the big game
and then afterwards we've got the dance.

437
00:48:00,124 --> 00:48:02,558
All the other guys are taking dates.

438
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:06,526
You're good-looking.
Lots of girls would go with you.

439
00:48:07,831 --> 00:48:10,891
l'm not interested in lots of girls, sir.

440
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:21,567
l'll take it up with the wife, Trip.
Do what l can.

441
00:48:22,513 --> 00:48:24,777
Thank you, sir.

442
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:28,785
- lt's a craft.
- Oh.

443
00:48:37,595 --> 00:48:42,532
Trip Fontaine and some of the boys
in the football squad

444
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,965
have asked to take the girls
to the Homecoming Dance.

445
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,696
You know how l feel
about that sort of thing.

446
00:48:48,872 --> 00:48:51,864
- l'm a chaperone at the dance.
- Oh, please!

447
00:48:54,078 --> 00:48:57,479
Your father and l will discuss it later.

448
00:48:59,316 --> 00:49:02,114
Mr Fontaine, may l speak with you, please?

449
00:49:03,020 --> 00:49:08,083
My wife and l have come to a decision
about your request...

450
00:49:22,439 --> 00:49:24,304
Yes!

451
00:49:28,912 --> 00:49:31,244
l'm taking Lux Lisbon to Homecoming.

452
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:34,076
l need three guys to take the other girls.

453
00:49:41,725 --> 00:49:46,162
- l'll give you three joints, Trip.
- Pick me. We can take my dad's Caddy.

454
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:49,525
You gotta pick me, Tripster.

455
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:52,896
Trip, man. You owe me.

456
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:55,561
l saved your ass with Woodhouse that time.

457
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:58,969
- Thanks, Dad.
- Who are the other boys?

458
00:49:59,143 --> 00:50:03,876
Let's see. Parker Denton, Jake Conley -
he's a good student, dear -

459
00:50:04,815 --> 00:50:06,976
and Kevin Head.

460
00:50:07,117 --> 00:50:11,611
- Who's taking who?
- They're going to raffle us off.

461
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:17,491
lt didn't make any difference
which dress the girls chose.

462
00:50:17,661 --> 00:50:21,927
Mrs Lisbon added an inch to the bust line
and two to the waist and hems.

463
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:25,627
The dresses became four identical sacks.

464
00:50:25,836 --> 00:50:28,737
- Everybody decent?
- Yeah.

465
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:32,241
OK. Come on.

466
00:50:34,311 --> 00:50:36,575
Oh, l'm sorry. Here we go.

467
00:50:36,747 --> 00:50:39,045
Come on. Together.

468
00:50:39,249 --> 00:50:41,308
And cheddar cheese.

469
00:50:45,889 --> 00:50:48,119
Oh, it's so exciting!

470
00:51:08,412 --> 00:51:12,178
- Are we ready?
- Ready, man.

471
00:51:12,349 --> 00:51:14,817
Let's do it.

472
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:21,581
ln the end Parkie won
because of the Cadillac,

473
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:24,557
Kevin Head,
because he had the killer weed,

474
00:51:24,728 --> 00:51:27,720
and Joe Hill Conley
because he won all the school prizes -

475
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:30,731
which Trip thought
would impress Mr and Mrs Lisbon.

476
00:51:32,669 --> 00:51:35,934
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mrs Lisbon.

477
00:51:36,106 --> 00:51:38,734
- Come in.
- Thank you.

478
00:51:51,955 --> 00:51:55,049
- Who's driving?
- l am.

479
00:51:55,259 --> 00:52:00,390
- How long have you had your license?
- Two months. l was a learner for a year.

480
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:04,192
The girls almost never go out in cars.

481
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:09,202
- There's so many accidents. Be careful.
- Oh, yes, ma'am.

482
00:52:09,406 --> 00:52:12,000
OK. The third degree's over.

483
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:14,534
Girls!

484
00:52:16,413 --> 00:52:19,746
- l'd better go. See you at the dance.
- See you there, Mr Lisbon.

485
00:52:20,651 --> 00:52:22,812
Bye, dear.

486
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:32,190
Girls. Come on down.

487
00:52:32,362 --> 00:52:34,728
The boys are here.

488
00:52:58,889 --> 00:53:03,155
We got white ones.
We didn't know what you were wearing

489
00:53:03,327 --> 00:53:08,287
and the flower guy said
that white would go with anything.

490
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:11,959
l'm glad you got white.

491
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:15,501
Why don't you pin them on?

492
00:53:42,933 --> 00:53:46,027
- There we go.
- All right, let's do it.

493
00:53:46,236 --> 00:53:47,635
Great.

494
00:53:47,838 --> 00:53:50,136
Bye, Mum.

495
00:54:00,384 --> 00:54:03,251
Oh, gosh, look! The car's there again!

496
00:54:03,487 --> 00:54:08,550
l'm sure Mr Lea's having an affair with
her. He followed her into the laundry room.

497
00:54:08,725 --> 00:54:13,059
- He's so sad with that red nose.
- Probably an alcoholic.

498
00:54:13,230 --> 00:54:17,064
- The Hesses are Nazis.
- They're Nazi sympathizers.

499
00:54:17,234 --> 00:54:21,466
They had a fit when Miss Schwartz
tried to join the tennis club.

500
00:54:21,638 --> 00:54:25,802
Nice aluminum siding!
Do they really think that looks OK?

501
00:54:26,543 --> 00:54:31,503
- Mr Peters ordered that from TV.
- lt's a Baldinos barbecue tree stump.

502
00:54:31,682 --> 00:54:34,480
l have never seen a barbecue on that thing!

503
00:54:34,651 --> 00:54:37,711
Actually, it's an escape tunnel
for the Shark.

504
00:54:37,888 --> 00:54:40,356
lt leads to the river and his speedboat.

505
00:54:40,624 --> 00:54:45,186
Paul often goes there. He can get into
anyone's basement through the sewers.

506
00:54:45,362 --> 00:54:47,421
- No way!
- Yeah.

507
00:55:02,479 --> 00:55:06,677
- Dad'll smell it on you.
- No, l got mints.

508
00:55:06,850 --> 00:55:11,253
- He'll smell it on your clothes.
- l'll say they were smoking in the toilets.

509
00:55:14,324 --> 00:55:17,157
- Don't let it die a virgin.
- That's gross.

510
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:19,887
Yeah, grow up, Conley.

511
00:56:15,786 --> 00:56:18,448
- Do you want to dance?
- Sure.

512
00:56:20,791 --> 00:56:22,190
Dance?

513
00:56:44,281 --> 00:56:47,773
We've been having such lovely weather,
don't you think?

514
00:56:47,951 --> 00:56:50,920
Yeah, we have... Nice.

515
00:56:59,262 --> 00:57:02,823
Good evening.
Could l have your attention for a moment?

516
00:57:02,999 --> 00:57:06,491
l hope you're having a good time.
lt sure looks like it.

517
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:10,766
The dance committee
really outdid themselves this time.

518
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:14,967
l'd like to open the voting
for Homecoming King and Queen.

519
00:57:15,178 --> 00:57:18,909
The ballot box is over there,
so please vote.

520
00:57:19,082 --> 00:57:23,178
And we'll make the announcement
in a little while. Thank you.

521
00:57:25,722 --> 00:57:29,089
- Did anybody see you come in?
- No.

522
00:57:29,259 --> 00:57:31,750
- What about you?
- No.

523
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:38,534
You'll love it.

524
00:57:44,074 --> 00:57:46,474
Peach schnapps.

525
00:57:46,877 --> 00:57:49,175
Babes love it.

526
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:08,053
That stuff tastes really good.

527
00:58:08,999 --> 00:58:11,900
l don't want any, thanks.

528
00:58:12,068 --> 00:58:15,037
Go on, just a taste. A tiny taste.

529
00:58:15,205 --> 00:58:17,969
Don't be such a goody-goody.

530
00:58:22,112 --> 00:58:24,672
Don't swallow it.

531
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:19,559
Can l have everyone's attention?

532
00:59:19,769 --> 00:59:23,535
l'd like you to put your hands together
for this year's Kind and Queen...

533
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:27,474
Trip Fontaine and Lux Lisbon.

534
01:00:55,865 --> 01:00:58,857
l'm having the best time!

535
01:01:14,351 --> 01:01:16,512
Let's go for a walk.

536
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:20,918
l'd better not.
l've got to go back in a minute.

537
01:01:21,091 --> 01:01:25,118
We can keep an eye on the car.
They won't leave without us.

538
01:01:26,329 --> 01:01:28,627
My dad...

539
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:32,131
Tell him you're putting the crown
in your locker.

540
01:01:34,270 --> 01:01:36,534
- See that divot there?
- Uh-huh?

541
01:01:36,706 --> 01:01:39,004
That's where l reamed this guy today.

542
01:01:39,175 --> 01:01:41,700
- A cross body-block.
- Really?

543
01:01:44,881 --> 01:01:48,817
- Maybe they went home with your dad?
- l doubt it.

544
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:53,717
- We're cooked.
- Luxy is, we're not.

545
01:02:11,641 --> 01:02:14,109
Does anyone have any mints?

546
01:02:14,277 --> 01:02:16,711
- Sorry.
- No.

547
01:02:21,051 --> 01:02:23,281
Bye, Parkie.

548
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:28,716
- We'll walk you to the door.
- No, don't.

549
01:02:29,426 --> 01:02:33,192
- Why not?
- Just don't.

550
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:36,764
OK.

551
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:39,926
Will you call me?

552
01:02:40,103 --> 01:02:42,003
Absolutely!

553
01:02:46,676 --> 01:02:48,109
Bye.

554
01:02:48,278 --> 01:02:51,111
- Bye.
- Bye.

555
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:31,872
- Are you OK?
- Where have you been?

556
01:05:32,041 --> 01:05:37,001
Look at the state of you!
Get in the house!

557
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:52,318
l walked home alone that night. l didn't care
how she got home. lt was weird.

558
01:05:52,962 --> 01:05:57,626
l mean, l liked her. l liked her a lot.
But out there on the field...

559
01:06:00,503 --> 01:06:03,131
lt was just different then.

560
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:07,942
That was the last time l saw her.

561
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:14,907
You know, most people
will never taste that kind of love.

562
01:06:15,084 --> 01:06:18,053
But at least l tasted it once, right?

563
01:06:22,925 --> 01:06:26,088
lt's time for your six o'clock group meeting.

564
01:06:40,810 --> 01:06:45,611
Given Lux's failure to make curfew,
everyone expected a crackdown.

565
01:06:47,350 --> 01:06:50,877
But few anticipated it would be so drastic.

566
01:06:51,721 --> 01:06:55,714
The girls were taken out of school
and Mrs Lisbon shut the house

567
01:06:55,892 --> 01:06:58,417
in maximum-security isolation.

568
01:06:59,429 --> 01:07:02,421
She did more than taking the girls
out of school.

569
01:07:02,598 --> 01:07:05,658
That Sunday,
after a spirited church sermon.

570
01:07:05,835 --> 01:07:09,168
Mrs Lisbon made Lux destroy her records.

571
01:07:09,372 --> 01:07:10,771
Now!

572
01:07:10,973 --> 01:07:12,907
But, Mum...

573
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:15,533
This is final, Luxy.

574
01:07:15,712 --> 01:07:18,909
- That's not fair.
- l said now.

575
01:07:36,399 --> 01:07:38,765
Now, Luxy!

576
01:07:51,881 --> 01:07:53,815
Come on.

577
01:07:58,221 --> 01:08:01,850
Kiss. Please don't make me do this.

578
01:08:02,024 --> 01:08:03,924
Burn it.

579
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:20,571
Oh, Mum, Aerosmith! Come on,
please don't make me burn this.

580
01:08:20,777 --> 01:08:22,745
Please...

581
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:25,312
What's that smell?

582
01:08:26,716 --> 01:08:31,278
All right, that'll do for now.
Give me these... Give me these.

583
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:33,785
l'll put them in the trash.

584
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:16,129
This was when we began seeing Lux
making love on the roof with random men.

585
01:09:16,299 --> 01:09:19,632
- ls she naked?
- You can't tell.

586
01:09:19,802 --> 01:09:22,100
Get it focused.

587
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:25,763
- Will you stop? Wait your turn.
- What are they doing?

588
01:09:25,975 --> 01:09:28,375
They're rolling around up there.

589
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:34,272
Hold on. She's on him.
He's rubbing his hands through her hair.

590
01:09:34,484 --> 01:09:38,284
- Let me look.
- No. No, it's my telescope, Chase.

591
01:09:40,389 --> 01:09:45,122
- Yes and what else?
- That man's in a burger chalet uniform.

592
01:09:45,294 --> 01:09:46,921
Let me see.

593
01:09:48,731 --> 01:09:52,394
Yeah. You never think
that those guys ever get lucky.

594
01:09:52,602 --> 01:09:56,003
Then she asks me
if what we'd just done was dirty.

595
01:09:56,205 --> 01:09:58,571
l knew what to say. l said no.

596
01:09:58,741 --> 01:10:01,574
Then she goes,
''You like me, don't you?''

597
01:10:01,744 --> 01:10:05,510
l didn't say anything.
lt's best to keep chicks guessing.

598
01:10:05,681 --> 01:10:10,118
Chase, honey.
Come practice your violin before dinner.

599
01:10:12,021 --> 01:10:16,515
You're not going to believe it.
Lux is on the roof again tonight!

600
01:10:16,692 --> 01:10:20,150
- Her hands are moving down.
- l gotta see this.

601
01:10:20,296 --> 01:10:23,823
- This is beautiful.
- Now she's on top of him.

602
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:28,168
- What's she doing, man?
- Wait.

603
01:10:28,304 --> 01:10:31,171
Now they're done. He's getting up.

604
01:10:33,175 --> 01:10:36,702
- That's it?
- That was quick.

605
01:10:44,687 --> 01:10:50,455
...plus one. And if the exponential is time,
then you'd have as you approach...

606
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:56,963
Oh, good morning. Have we
photosynthesized our breakfast today?

607
01:11:08,044 --> 01:11:11,411
- Hello, Ronald.
- Hi, Harry.

608
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:15,879
Your daughters haven't been at school
for over two weeks.

609
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,714
Have you checked out back?

610
01:11:25,161 --> 01:11:27,425
They've found a new Math teacher.

611
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:31,191
- He'll have to get another job.
- l know.

612
01:11:33,502 --> 01:11:37,529
How long can those girls
be cooped up like that?

613
01:11:55,524 --> 01:11:58,254
Go away. This is our tree.

614
01:11:58,394 --> 01:12:03,331
Girls, girls...
lt's a little late. This tree is dead.

615
01:12:03,532 --> 01:12:07,059
- Why don't you leave it up to Nature?
- lf we did, there'd be no trees left.

616
01:12:07,236 --> 01:12:09,898
That's what it's going to be like anyway.

617
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:13,508
lf they didn't bring the fungus from Europe,
this wouldn't have happened.

618
01:12:13,676 --> 01:12:16,110
OK. Let's go.

619
01:12:17,813 --> 01:12:19,212
No?

620
01:12:19,348 --> 01:12:23,478
That's it. l have an order
to cut down your elm tree,

621
01:12:23,653 --> 01:12:25,951
but your kids won't let us.

622
01:12:26,122 --> 01:12:31,287
- How do you know it's sick.
- Believe me, it's dead for Christsake.

623
01:12:31,427 --> 01:12:35,363
- Arbotect is a less aggressive therapy.
- lt doesn't work.

624
01:12:35,564 --> 01:12:40,331
- l leave that tree there, they'll all go.
- They could anyway.

625
01:12:40,536 --> 01:12:42,731
Look, l don't want to call the police.

626
01:12:42,905 --> 01:12:47,842
Our daughters are standing on our lawn.
Since when is that a crime?

627
01:13:02,858 --> 01:13:07,318
Clive. See those girls in their nighties?
That's the shot that l want.

628
01:13:07,530 --> 01:13:12,331
Honey, you'll have to move forward.
l want those girls in their nighties.

629
01:13:12,535 --> 01:13:16,596
- Let's back up.
- Give me some more slack.

630
01:13:16,806 --> 01:13:20,503
- There you go. ls that good?
- Great.

631
01:13:20,676 --> 01:13:22,769
Four sisters of Cecilia Lisbon,

632
01:13:22,945 --> 01:13:28,110
the teenager whose suicide last summer
focused awareness on a national problem,

633
01:13:28,284 --> 01:13:34,223
put their own lives in jeopardy by trying to
protect the elm that Cecilia so dearly loved.

634
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:27,275
The circles under your eyes come out
when it's overcast, so you need to wear...

635
01:14:27,476 --> 01:14:32,106
For the next few weeks
we hardly saw the girls at all.

636
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:35,079
Joe didn't call Therese as he had promised.

637
01:14:40,756 --> 01:14:44,692
And Lux never spoke to Trip again.

638
01:14:46,562 --> 01:14:49,122
You're the stone fox.

639
01:14:54,069 --> 01:14:58,529
The girls' only contact with the world
was through the catalogues they ordered.

640
01:14:58,707 --> 01:15:02,837
lt filled their mailbox
with pictures of high-end fashions

641
01:15:03,012 --> 01:15:05,947
and brochures for exotic vacations.

642
01:15:07,016 --> 01:15:12,181
Unable to go anywhere, they travelled
in their imaginations to Siamese temples,

643
01:15:12,388 --> 01:15:18,122
or past an old man with a leaf broom
tidying a moss-carpeted speck of Japan.

644
01:15:20,629 --> 01:15:26,124
We ordered the same catalogues and hiked
through dusty passes with the girls.

645
01:15:27,002 --> 01:15:31,302
Stopping every now and then
to help them with their backpacks.

646
01:15:31,507 --> 01:15:34,567
Placing our hands on their warm,
moist shoulders,

647
01:15:34,743 --> 01:15:38,509
and gazing off at the fire sunsets.

648
01:15:38,747 --> 01:15:42,148
We drank tea with them in a water pavilion.

649
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:45,279
We did whatever we wanted.

650
01:15:46,155 --> 01:15:50,091
Cecilia hadn't died.
She was a bride in Calcutta.

651
01:15:53,028 --> 01:15:58,125
The only way we felt close to the girls
was through these impossible excursions

652
01:15:58,300 --> 01:16:00,632
which have scared us forever,

653
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:04,636
making us happier with dreams than wives.

654
01:16:06,308 --> 01:16:11,268
Collecting everything we could of theirs,
the Lisbon girls wouldn't leave our minds,

655
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,778
but they were slipping away.

656
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:18,977
The colors of their eyes faded along with
the exact location of their dimples.

657
01:16:19,188 --> 01:16:23,750
From five they had become four,
and they were all living in the dead...

658
01:16:24,326 --> 01:16:26,692
becoming shadows.

659
01:16:26,862 --> 01:16:30,161
We were losing them
when the girls contacted us.

660
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:34,462
One long. Two short.

661
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:37,772
One long. Have you got that?

662
01:16:38,474 --> 01:16:41,204
- That's it.
- OK.

663
01:16:42,745 --> 01:16:44,610
Help.

664
01:16:45,281 --> 01:16:47,146
Send.

665
01:16:48,517 --> 01:16:51,714
Bo... Bo.

666
01:16:54,056 --> 01:16:58,083
- Bobo?
- Bobo. That's it... Bobo.

667
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:02,856
''Help. Send Bobo.''
l thought you knew Morse code!

668
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:33,524
There's something here for you.

669
01:17:41,203 --> 01:17:43,330
l got one, too.

670
01:17:45,741 --> 01:17:48,574
We racked our brains
for a way of contacting them.

671
01:17:48,744 --> 01:17:52,874
Tom suggested we fly a kite
with a message alongside the house.

672
01:17:53,048 --> 01:17:55,539
But that had logistical problems.

673
01:17:55,684 --> 01:18:01,179
ln the end, the answer was simple -
we called them on the telephone.

674
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:04,521
727 8221 .

675
01:18:06,261 --> 01:18:08,525
Get ready.

676
01:18:10,966 --> 01:18:14,424
- Hello?
- Go!

677
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:28,777
Call us. 727 0487.

678
01:18:34,890 --> 01:18:37,051
Shit. lt's them.

679
01:19:50,833 --> 01:19:54,769
- l'm going home. See you tomorrow.
- See you later.

680
01:19:58,540 --> 01:20:01,202
- We're suffocating.
- Lux, you're safe here.

681
01:20:01,443 --> 01:20:03,104
l can't breathe.

682
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,175
No answer.

683
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:33,303
- What time is it?
- Any time now.

684
01:20:33,509 --> 01:20:36,376
- Guys, there it is.
- What?

685
01:20:39,748 --> 01:20:41,909
Yeah, it's them.

686
01:20:43,152 --> 01:20:45,347
Let's go.

687
01:20:56,198 --> 01:20:59,531
l've got the keys to my mum's car.

688
01:21:22,925 --> 01:21:25,189
Maybe we should knock.

689
01:21:31,466 --> 01:21:33,934
We're here.

690
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:47,174
lt's about time.
We've been waiting for you guys.

691
01:21:47,349 --> 01:21:50,807
We've got a car.
We'll take you anywhere you want to go.

692
01:21:50,986 --> 01:21:53,147
lt's a Cougar. lt's got a big trunk.

693
01:21:54,256 --> 01:21:58,317
- Can l sit up front?
- Sure.

694
01:22:01,096 --> 01:22:04,190
Which one of you
is going to sit next to me?

695
01:22:05,634 --> 01:22:09,661
- Where are your parents?
- Asleep.

696
01:22:09,838 --> 01:22:13,137
- What about your sisters?
- They're coming.

697
01:22:14,076 --> 01:22:16,476
Come on. lt's late.

698
01:22:17,913 --> 01:22:22,077
Wait five minutes. We have to wait
until my parents are asleep.

699
01:22:22,251 --> 01:22:26,585
They take forever.
My mum's an insomniac.

700
01:22:29,758 --> 01:22:33,558
We'd better take our car,
there's more room.

701
01:22:34,563 --> 01:22:40,365
- Think you can handle a station wagon?
- Sure. lt's not a stick, is it?

702
01:22:40,569 --> 01:22:43,129
- No.
- Yeah, no problem.

703
01:22:43,305 --> 01:22:46,763
- Will you let me steer?
- Sure.

704
01:22:46,942 --> 01:22:50,400
We should go. l just heard something.
lt could be your mum.

705
01:22:51,313 --> 01:22:54,146
Come on in.

706
01:23:03,191 --> 01:23:07,389
l'll go wait in the car.
You guys wait here for my sisters.

707
01:24:03,452 --> 01:24:07,388
These girls make me crazy.
lf l just felt one of them once!

708
01:24:11,126 --> 01:24:12,957
What?

709
01:24:30,112 --> 01:24:33,206
We would never be sure about
the sequence of events.

710
01:24:33,949 --> 01:24:36,474
We argue about it still.

711
01:24:39,221 --> 01:24:43,317
Most likely, Bonnie had died
while we were waiting in the living room

712
01:24:43,525 --> 01:24:46,085
dreaming of highways.

713
01:24:46,261 --> 01:24:50,027
Mary put her head in the oven
shortly thereafter.

714
01:24:50,232 --> 01:24:54,794
Therese, stuffed with sleeping pills,
was gone by the time we got there.

715
01:24:56,171 --> 01:24:58,639
Lux was the last to go.

716
01:25:07,315 --> 01:25:11,513
lt's four o'clock on Sunday afternoon.
Do you know where your children are?

717
01:25:11,686 --> 01:25:15,315
Bonnie, the younger Lisbon sister...

718
01:25:15,524 --> 01:25:20,188
Therese Lisbon,
a horse-lover, has written to...

719
01:25:20,395 --> 01:25:23,523
Mary wanted to be a cheerleader,
but her mother wouldn't let her.

720
01:25:23,698 --> 01:25:26,064
..suicide in their house...

721
01:25:26,234 --> 01:25:31,069
- l wasn't able to express the anger l felt.
- ..Lydia Perl, Channel Eight News.

722
01:25:40,315 --> 01:25:44,217
None of my daughters lacked for any love.

723
01:25:45,454 --> 01:25:48,548
There was plenty of love in our house.

724
01:25:49,891 --> 01:25:52,485
l never understood why.

725
01:26:24,192 --> 01:26:29,391
After the suicides, Mr and Mrs Lisbon
gave up any attempt to lead a normal life.

726
01:26:32,133 --> 01:26:34,863
They had Mr Hadley pack up the house,

727
01:26:35,036 --> 01:26:38,096
and sell the furniture in a garage sale.

728
01:26:40,609 --> 01:26:44,705
Mr Lisbon sold the house
to a young couple from Boston.

729
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:52,281
We, of course, took the family photos
that were put out with the trash.

730
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:58,556
ln the end, we had pieces of the puzzle,
but gaps still remained.

731
01:26:58,727 --> 01:27:02,857
Oddly-shaped emptiness,
mapped by what surrounded them,

732
01:27:03,031 --> 01:27:05,727
like countries we couldn't name.

733
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:11,338
What lingered after them was not life,

734
01:27:12,474 --> 01:27:16,274
but the most trivial list of mundane facts -

735
01:27:18,046 --> 01:27:20,776
a clock ticking on the wall,

736
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:24,182
a room dim at noon,

737
01:27:25,453 --> 01:27:30,152
the outrageousness of a human being
thinking only of herself.

738
01:27:34,729 --> 01:27:39,496
We began the impossible process
of trying to forget them.

739
01:27:45,206 --> 01:27:47,970
Our parents were able to do this,

740
01:27:48,643 --> 01:27:54,980
returning to their tennis foursomes and
cocktails as though they'd seen it all before.

741
01:27:55,150 --> 01:27:57,618
lt was full-fledged summer again -

742
01:27:57,819 --> 01:28:02,916
over a year after Cecilia had slit her
wrists spreading the poison in the air.

743
01:28:03,091 --> 01:28:07,687
A spill at the plant increased the lake's
phosphates and produced algae

744
01:28:07,862 --> 01:28:13,630
so that the swamp's smell filled the air
infiltrating the genteel mansions.

745
01:28:14,903 --> 01:28:20,102
Debutantes cried at coming out
in a season remembered for its bad smell.

746
01:28:21,843 --> 01:28:24,710
The O'Connors ingeniously made

747
01:28:24,879 --> 01:28:30,181
the theme of their daughter Alice's
debutante party ''Asphyxiation''.

748
01:28:30,418 --> 01:28:35,515
Like everyone else,
we went to forget about the Lisbon girls.

749
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:38,454
She'll give him a heart attack.

750
01:29:22,804 --> 01:29:24,897
Hi, Parkie.

751
01:29:29,110 --> 01:29:33,069
How about the acting bug?

752
01:29:33,248 --> 01:29:35,546
l caught it from Kinky.

753
01:29:36,885 --> 01:29:42,983
And l want to announce tonight that next fall
Alice is going to school in Newhaven.

754
01:29:46,061 --> 01:29:49,519
l hear they have
a great grammar school up there.

755
01:29:49,698 --> 01:29:52,496
ln fact, Sam's father built it, didn't he?

756
01:29:52,667 --> 01:29:55,397
The hospital, Paul.

757
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:59,198
We're so proud of Alice.
We couldn't be prouder.

758
01:29:59,340 --> 01:30:01,934
Here's to her.

759
01:30:07,515 --> 01:30:11,281
l've had it. Goodbye cruel world.

760
01:30:18,126 --> 01:30:23,325
No, no, no! You don't understand me.
l'm a teenager, l got problems.

761
01:30:34,776 --> 01:30:39,611
So much has been said
about the girls over the years,

762
01:30:39,781 --> 01:30:42,909
but we have never found an answer.

763
01:30:44,953 --> 01:30:48,582
lt didn't matter how old they had been,

764
01:30:49,791 --> 01:30:52,191
or that they were girls,

765
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:57,393
but only that we had loved them.

766
01:30:57,599 --> 01:31:02,298
And that they still do not hear us
calling them out of those rooms

767
01:31:03,938 --> 01:31:07,305
where they went to be alone for all time.

768
01:31:08,343 --> 01:31:12,143
We will never find the pieces
to put them back together.

769
01:37:00,261 --> 01:37:01,228
